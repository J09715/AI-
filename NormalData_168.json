["Q: Installing specific Package (New Version) I am using Ubuntu 12.04 and my current version of Open Blas is 0.1alpha2.2-3.  There is a bug in this version that has been fixed by https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/openblas/+bug/817212\nHow can I install this newer version which has resolved the bug?\n\nA: You can manually download the v2.6 .deb from Ubuntu Raring (13.04) here : http://packages.ubuntu.com/raring/libopenblas-base (choose your architecture, amd64 is 64 bit and i386 is 32 bit), then install it on your system. \nYou could also add a PPA to get the updates, currently v2.8 (may broke your system : No PPA can be confirmed 100% safe for use or not. PPAs are a use-at-your-own-risk solution, but most times they're generally safe but there could be other system issues on your end that can cause PPA'd software to break) : \nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:marutter/rdev\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get upgrade libopenblas-base\n\n-\nNote: Here, with OpenBlas, depedencies are satisfied, so you will be able to do this. It is not always the case. \n\nA: this might help: \n  apt-get --purge remove (package)     \n  apt-get upgrade (package name)\n\n", "Q: How to Partition Your internal harddrive in Ubuntu 12.04 LTS I am a newbie in ubuntu 12.04 LTS. I want to partition my hard drive of 320GB so that i can divide it into 2 or more partitons. How to proceed? can anybody help?\nAlready installed gparted but i am not able to unmount my /dev/sda1 nor am i able to create a new partion table. \nwhen i select unmount /dev/sda1 the message is: Most likely other partitions are also mounted on these mount points. You are advised to unmount them manually.\nwhen i select create partion table the msg is: 2 partitions are currently active on device /dev/sda.\n![This is my Hard drive properties in gpart][1]\n\nA: GParted is ok, but you must boot your system from a live system. You can take the usb drive/ dvd you installed Ubuntu from.  \n\nA: This is the lesson How To Partition and this is about partitions that are required to run Ubuntu and optional Disk Space. It's also the best to partition during clean installation.\n\nA: Trying to unmount the partition that you booted from is like trying to change a tire while you are driving the car.\nTo live boot you must have a Live DVD/USB. If you don't have that first download the iso image file from The Ubuntu web page.\nNow you will need to different follow instructions depending on if you want to create a Live DVD or a Live USB.\nFor DVD follow the instructions on the official Ubuntu page.\nFor USB follow the instructions on the official Ubuntu page.\n\n*\n\n*Once the DVD/USB is ready you have to boot from that. How you do it\ndepends on your computer and varies from model to model.\n\n*Reboot your computer. When the first image shows press the\nEsc or F12 or Delete key to boot\nfrom the DVD or USB.\n\n*Then choose \"Try Ubuntu without installing\" and Ubuntu will boot\nfrom DVD/USB.\n\n*Then proceed with Gparted.\n\nHope this helps\n", "Q: What was the meaning of a special character on the shebang line? I saw a script like below,\n#! /bin/zsh -\ndel=10\nrm -f /mnt/md0/capture/DCN/*(ND.Om[1,$del])\n\nWhat was purpose of adding - on a shebang line?\n\nA: A - or -- signals the end of options and disables further option processing.  Which means that bash will not accept any of its option. Any arguments after the -- are treated as filenames and arguments. \nAn argument of - is equivalent to --. This is done to improve script security. Some user may perform setuid based script root spoofing. To avoid interpreter spoofing you need to add -- to #!/bin/bash.

Never the less, the answer to your question would be \"Yes, if there is a 'mongodb' upstart service\".\nThere are a couple ways to check for this:\nsudo initctl list | grep mongo\n\nIf this command returns anything, check that the service it lists matches the name you're using ('mongodb').\nOther wise, check the contents of /etc/init (note, not /etc/init.d) and see if there is a mongo related .conf file. This will be the name of the service to use, meaning change your start on stanza to start on started [service name].\nIf there is no mongo related upstart service, then mongo is still using init.d scripts. If that's the case you'll need to find or make a mongo upstart script, install it and disable the init.d scripts (I used bum for that).\nGoogling for that turns up a couple of options:\nUbuntu upstart script for MongoDB with automatic repair\nThis one looks more complete:\nMongoDB multiple instance upstart scripts\n", "Q: sed, grep, and awk file sorting I'm trying to get all the files which have 'load' in their names from a directory.\nI'm trying to do:\nfind -type f | sed -s 'load\n\nHowever, I recurrently receive an error\nsed: -e expression #1, char 1: unknown command: `f'\nA worse part is that although I am able to manipulate regexes I 'm really bad at using grep/sed/awk, and this is slowing me down all the time.

How about a file name with multiple dots? Sometimes it makes practical sense for a folder name to contain a dot (.).  For example, you are storing data for an experiment conducted at L=0.5.  So the folder might be named:\nexperiment_L0.5\n\nA similar issue may arise for file names. For example:\nfile_L0.5.txt\n\nWorking in Ubuntu, is this bad practice? What about sharing these directories with a Windows user?\n\nA: For completeness' sake, the names which consist only of a single dot . or two dots .. are special:\n\n\n*\n\n*. refers to the current directory\n\n*.. refers to the parent directory\n\n\nThose entries are added automatically and always exist, so you can't have a file named . or ...\n\nA: As far as I know there are no issues with naming folders and files with a single or multiple dots.\nUbuntu generally does not use the dot and three characters (such as .txt) to identify the file type. So this has no special meaning in the Ubuntu context. This is useful when sharing files with Windows. Ubuntu uses Magic Numbers in the first few bytes of the file to identify the file type. However, Nautilus ignores the magic numbers if the dot and three characters extension is available to identify the file type. This setting can be changed. See  Force nautilus to ignore extensions\nIn Ubuntu, starting a file or folder names with a dot, such as .experiment_L0.5, makes the file or folder hidden. You can toggle the display of hidden files by pressing Ctrl+H in Nautilus. In Windows a file name starting with a . in front of it is not hidden. So if you transfer a hidden file named .experiment_L0.5 into a Windows system, it will be plainly visible.\nIn Ubuntu a file name can end with a dot, as it has no special meaning placed at the end. However, in Windows a dot separates the file name and extension, and a file name ending with a dot but no extension is not allowed. When I tried to create such a file in Windows I got a file with just the name, no dot, no extension.\nReference: Wiki on Filenames\nHope this helps.\n\nA: The short answer\n\n\n*\n\n*Windows does not allow the following characters: <>:\"/\\|?* (source)\n\n*More characters that are discouraged are: space  and dot . (source)\n\n\n*\n\n*Command line tools are harder to use when you have spaces in names (harder, not impossible)\n\n*Dots are used in RegEx (e.g. when you want to use grep). A leading dot makes a file hidden by convention in Linux. In Windows, dots are used in the file extension, which is used for file type detection.\n\n\n*Windows also will not allow filenames CON, PRN, AUX, CLOCK$, NUL\nCOM1, COM2, COM3, COM4, COM5, COM6, COM7, COM8, COM9\nLPT1, LPT2, LPT3, LPT4, LPT5, LPT6, LPT7, LPT8, and LPT9. (source)\n\n*The only characters not allowed in Unix file systems I know are / and null (the null byte, \\0).\n\n*See also: File system limits (I don't know to which Windows you want to be compatible).\n\n\nThe long answer\nTechnical background: File System\nUbuntu makes use of the ext4 file system. A file system tracks where files are stored on the underlying storage (disk or SSD or whatever), permissions in the form of owner/group/other can read/write/execute, timestamps, name.\nThe file system structures the available storage. The first block is called the \"superblock\". This block is used to mount a file system. As far as I know, every modern file system divides it's space in blocks. I think (and I'm not too sure about it) that most file systems also have a fixed block size, though the block size can be configured when the file system is created. ext4 (and also ext2 and ext3) make use of so called \"inodes\" for files and directories. Those inodes contain pointers to other blocks (that might also be inodes or be \"data blocks\"). And the \"first\" inode of a file contains all of the information I mentioned above.\nOne other information is the \"type\" of the file. \"Type\" can be:\n\n\n*\n\n*regular file\n\n*directory\n\n*device file (block or character device)\n\n*...\n\n\nIn fact, you can also open directories with an editor:\nvim /home\n\nAs the directory does not contain the full path, but only the names of the content I don't see a reason why files can not contain a /. I guess it might be convenience. (Does anybody know why / is not allowed?)\nHowever, things are different for other file systems. The FAT16 and FAT32 used a so called \"file allocation table\". This means there is a table that contains all files that are stored on your file, at which \"cluster\" they start and at which cluster they end as a singly linked list.\nThe important thing I wanted to tell you is that disallowed characters might also depend on the file system.\nTechnical background: File Types\n\n\n*\n\n*Windows uses file extensions to detect file types\n\n*Linux uses \"Magic Bytes\" to detect file types. Magic Bytes are part of the content of the file and hence completely independent of the name. These bytes are part of the specification of the file type (see png specification as an example). It also uses the filename extensions for files with the same magic bytes such as .txt or .html (both are text files).\n\n\nRelated\n\n\n*\n\n*Why was '.' chosen to represent the current directory and '..' for parent directory?\n\n*What are inodes good for?\n\n*A Non-Technical Look Inside the EXT2 File System\n\nA: This do not matter, not in linux nor in windows.\nIt's a common practice to have folder named \"program.d\" - to save configuration and stuff for a program (look in /etc directory)\n\nA: File naming is very flexible in Unix, Linux file-systems. The only file-name you can't have is a null character or the one containing a / in its name. But it surely would be a good practice to avoid using the characters that are forbidden/reserved in other systems from name-portability point of view; like you shouldn't use any of \" * : < > ? \\ / | characters (restricted by NTFS) in your file-name if you want to access the file in a Windows system.\nAnd about using a . (period) in file-name, I think it should be fine as it doesn't seem to be a \"reserved\" character in any of the systems (except for OpenVMS, MS-DOS and Windows where its use in file/directory name is allowed but the last occurrence will be interpreted to be the extension separator in VMS, MS-DOS and Windows) as mentioned in the Wikipedia  link that follows:\n\n\n*\n\n*Filename : Comparison of filename limitations\nIn other systems, usually considered as part of the filename, and more than one period may be allowed. In Unix, a leading period means the file or folder is normally hidden.\n", "Q: How to do packaging of ADT (Android Development Tools) for PPA?

The computer recognizes both when they are plugged in, but prioritizes one over the other for normal bluetooth connections.\nI would love to be able to connect to multiple bluetooth speakers (each with their own receiver) in a setting like this:\nComputer USB Adapter A to Speaker Receiver A\nComputer USB Adapter B to Speaker Receiver B\nAudio output to both A and B the same.\nI know I can't use one dongle to connect to two speakers, which is why I'm asking.\nHere is my info:\nLSUSB\n\nBus 002 Device 003: ID 0a12:0001 Cambridge Silicon Radio, Ltd Bluetooth Dongle (HCI mode)  \nBus 002 Device 004: ID 0a12:0001 Cambridge Silicon Radio, Ltd Bluetooth Dongle (HCI mode)\n\nAlso\nHCICONFIG\n\nhci1:   Type: BR/EDR  Bus: USB\n    BD Address: 00:11:22:98:76:54  ACL MTU: 1021:4  SCO MTU: 180:1\n    UP RUNNING PSCAN ISCAN \n    RX bytes:398 acl:0 sco:0 events:17 errors:0\n    TX bytes:305 acl:0 sco:0 commands:19 errors:3\n\nhci0:   Type: BR/EDR  Bus: USB\n    BD Address: 00:11:22:98:76:54  ACL MTU: 1021:4  SCO MTU: 180:1\n    UP RUNNING \n    RX bytes:750 acl:0 sco:0 events:45 errors:0\n    TX bytes:390 acl:0 sco:0 commands:30 errors:2\n\nAnd Finally\nhci0:   Type: BR/EDR  Bus: USB\n    BD Address: 00:11:22:98:76:54  ACL MTU: 1021:4  SCO MTU: 180:1\n    UP RUNNING \n    RX bytes:1027 acl:0 sco:0 events:48 errors:0\n    TX bytes:399 acl:0 sco:0 commands:33 errors:2\n    Features: 0xff 0x3e 0x09 0x76 0x80 0x01 0x00 0x80\n    Packet type: DM1 DM3 DM5 DH1 DH3 DH5 HV1 HV2 HV3 \n    Link policy: RSWITCH HOLD SNIFF \n    Link mode: SLAVE ACCEPT \n    Name: 'barf'\n    Class: 0x6e0100\n    Service Classes: Networking, Rendering, Capturing, Audio, Telephony\n    Device Class: Computer, Uncategorized\n    HCI Version: 2.0 (0x3)  Revision: 0x50\n    LMP Version: 2.0 (0x3)  Subversion: 0x3\n    Manufacturer: Mitel Semiconductor (16)\n\nThanks so much!!!\n\nA: No, at least I think probably you could't but because both USB Bluetooth dongles have the same MAC address.

It's about 3 DVDs and sizing 10GB.\nI have downloaded all DVDs but I didn't find any installers in it. I wonder if there is a way I can make a custom Ubuntu CD by just choosing the needed open source software from my company. Is that possible?\nWhat can I benefit from these DVDs right now? any help would be appreciated.\nBy the way I don't find an answer for my question in this question\n\nA: If you want a Linux with just the software, you want, why not try Arch Linux? By the way, you also have Ubuntu LiveCDCustomization and LiveCDCustomizationFromScratch.\nI have never tried those, and I think you'll probably be more happy with Arch, which also has its own Live CD creation tool with all info here :) plus the wiki of Arch is amazing! You'll definitely find all you need to know there!\nLong story short...you don't need to compile the whole distribution to customize it the way you want :P It would probably took WAY too much time at your work, except if you don't have nothing else to do.\n\nA: Several years ago we needed a simple method to get ubuntu on a desktop. What I did was the following. \n\n\n*\n\n*Using a testmachine I installed Ubuntu from a standard image (preferably an LTS version)\n\n*I removed all software that I didn't want\n\n*I installed all software needed, configured the desktop etc to what I thought was best\n\n*For software like teamviewer that creates a unique ID for each machine, I did NOT start it to avoid creating that unique ID\n\n\nNow I had this clean and \"perfect\" setup, I needed a way to get it on a new PC.\n\n\n*\n\n*I created an image using Clonezilla. \n\n*I copied this image on a USB stick (or CD or DVD).\n\n*I used a second USB stick to put clonezilla on, which can be started from that usb stick.\n\n*I started the process of installing the ubuntu image from the stick using clonezilla\n\n*This process includes how to start Clonezilla from CD or USB (editing bios etc)\n\n*Once I had all steps in this process working without guessing what to do, I made screenshots of each step, put them in a Word/Writer document with instructions what keys to press etc.\n\n*\n\n*NB: I created the screenshots with my phone as I didn't know how to do this when using Clonezilla - ugly but it worked.\n\n\n*When I had this installation manual ready, I tried it on another person, of he could do this without my help.\n\n*When this worked, I created a PDF with the manual, two usb sticks per install, and gave it out to whoever needed it.\n\n\nThe result was a 10 minute installation process with a working Ubuntu desktop. The person who's going to do these installs has to be comfortable doing this, but after a while it's very easy. \nYou should use an LTS version to avoid having to do this all over after 18 months, when the this Ubuntu version is not updated anymore. \nWe used one type/brand of computer. Different computers probably have different bios screens, and that might be confusing to many people. So depending on this and on the person doing the install, this might be a problem.\nI don't know if this helps you or not. Maybe you want a normal installation cd like the one you download. Like it or not, it's an option you can consider.\n", "Q: Can't install Ubuntu 64 bit I have an HP pavilion g7 running windows 7 64 bit. I have 3.48 gigs of usable ram and 185 gigs of free hard drive space. I downloaded oracle's virtual box for windows 7 64 bit and Ubuntu 12.04 64 bit. When I open the virtual box to install Ubuntu it says it needs an x86-64amd CPU but it detects an i686 CPU and won't continue with the install. If my hardware meets the requirements I don't understand why it won't install... Any suggestions?\n\nA: It's because Virtualbox is not using hardware virtualization, without this it can only present a basic 32-bit CPU to the virtual machine. In order to allow virtualbox to  present a 64-bit your CPU, select the virtual machine in the VirtualBox Manager, click on \"settings\", then select the \"system\" category (on the left), then go to the \"acceleration\" tab (last one), and ensure \"enable vt-x/amd-v\" is both enabled and ticked.\nIf it's not tickable (i.e. greyed out), that means your CPU's virtualization support is disabled. Enable it in your system's BIOS settings and try again.\n", "Q: windows maximize to full screen and bottom hides behind the panel I have one monitor above another.  I would like to have a panel at the top of the bottom monitor and another at the bottom of the top monitor.\nPutting the panels in place works as expected.  However, when the panels are on the edge of a screen that butts up against another screen, space is not reserved for the panel when maximizing windows.  So, if I try and maximize Firefox, I can't see the \"addons\" bar at the bottom.\nI have tested this in both kubuntu and xubuntu with similar results.  I found a bug for KDE that describes the problem and a comment says:\n\npanels in between monitors are not supported, and this is a limitation\n  in the freedesktop specification for reserving space for things like\n  panels.\n\nThere is another forum posts that talks some about this:\nhttp://forum.kde.org/viewtopic.php?f=66&t=102303\nIs there any way to get the limitation in the specification addressed and/or are there any workarounds to make the applications maximize without being behind the panels?\n\nA: how about this:\nSettings Manager -> Panel -> Display -> Uncheck \"Don't reserve space on borders\"\n\nA: Easy fix in Xubuntu 12.04 (you didn't say which edition you're using):\nRight-click on the panel, select Properties (make sure it's panel properties rather than one of the launchers or applets on the panel_), then click the Appearance tab.  Opacity should be set to 100.\nIf panels are set to \"vanish\" when not mousing over them, then open windows will go right over the \"invisible\" panel.  Use the settings screen to keep the panel visible.\n\nA: In ubuntu, you can reserve space for your panels with xprop, using the _NET_WM_STRUT_PARTIAL property (the reserved space is called strut).\nThe idea is to get the ID of your panel window with xwininfo, and feed it together with the desired coordinates into xprop -set.\nIf this answer seems to work for you, you can check out my blogpost for a detailed how-to and more info on using xprop.\n\nA: I was having this problem as well. I have the panel at the bottom of the screen. The workaround of making the panel transparent on mouse-exit worked alright, but I noticed that when I moved the mouse all the way to the bottom of the screen, the panel would go transparent as if there was a single pixel between the panel and the bottom of the screen.\nI dragged the panel up a little and then back down. After it snapped to the edge of the screen, there was no longer a pixel between it and the bottom of the screen and maximized windows now correctly maximize to the edge of the panel instead of to the edge of the screen.\n\nA: A workaround: go to Panel Settings, make the panel smaller (by dragging it) and maximize it again (there is a \"maximize panel\" button).\nAfter that, windows do not go beneath it anymore.\n", "Q: network-manager device not managed with virt-manager I am using Ubuntu 12.04.4 64 bit .\nAfter installing virt-manager, I found my scenario would be to user bridge networking, so I managed to let my machines works with bridge interface br0.\nFrom that time I lost the network-manager.

It refers using the Python version of juju, not the currently supported and maintained juju-core.\n\n*Try removing your environments.yaml from ~/.juju and also make sure you remove any ~/.juju/environments/*.jenv (beware, that if you remove the .jenv' file of a running environment, you are effectively cutting your access to that cloud from Juju). Then, runjuju init, which will generate you a boilerplateenvironments.yaml`, containing the annotated set of most supported provider/cloud-specific configuration settings, commented as needed to indicate their default values, if any.\n\n*Here's a very good guide on setting up a Juju OpenStack environment.\n\n*You shouldn't need to use EC2-compatible API and credentials, just your OpenStack ones, the same you use to login to horizon or through nova client.\n\n*Using a file like the suggested OpenStack RC file, Juju can go with minimal configuration, taking all other settings through the exported environment variables.\n\n", "Q: Installing Tremulous on 64-bit Ubuntu 13.10 I want to install a game that looks really fun, called Tremulous, but when I run the installer it says:\n /usr/local/bin/tremulous: error while loading shared libraries: libSDL-1.2.so.0: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory\n\nI read somewhere that it has something to do with it being 32 bit when I have 64 bit.

OK, friends, I have a hard drive question (not specifically about Ubuntu):\nSo, I accidentally spilled water all over the keyboard of my Dell Latitude D610 laptop--and then it would only sometimes detect the hard drive, and when it did detect it, it would crash after a few minutes.\nSo, I ordered a new hard drive and installed it, thinking it would solve the problem, but come to find out, it brought the same error:\n\"HDD Error: No boot device detected.

Any advice for this, please?  Thanks!\n\nA: Liquid spills produce various symptoms and issues depending on which components have been damaged. There is not much you can do on a software level since it's a hardware problem. you MAY still be able to get files out of it by connecting the hard drive to another machine, but fixing this laptop may not be cost-effective.. again, depending on which components have been damaged.. I fix laptops at work and liquid spills often kill the system, even though it appear to be partially working right now.. In some cases you can take it apart , clean out the components, dry it out, replace some cheap parts (keyboard, HD) and make it work again, but there is no guarantees since liquid damage can produce additional issues even two months after the fact.. I've seen a lot of that happen before. Good luck!\n", "Q: How do I exit from dash -n?

If you chown them to root you will be in trouble in the next login. At the time of login your profile could not be loaded as you have no longer access permission to the configuration files. And you will be most probably kicked out to the login screen. In the process you will lock yourself.\n\nWill recursively changing the ownership of every file in my user's ~ to be my user be harmful?\nThere is no harm in doing so. But keep in mind the case as pointed out by Lekensteyn in  the comment above. I am quoting it,\n\nBeware of rare edge cases when literally executing the command in the title, $USER and $HOME can be changed. E.g. USER=nobody; HOME=/; sudo chown -R $USER $HOME is unsafe.\n\nThere is a better proposal than to recursive chown in the comment above,\n\nyou can find files not owned by you using find ~ ! -user $USER -ls (assuming a same environment where the variables have not been changed).

However, in addition to being a normal user, you are also a member of the sudo group, meaning that you have the right to elevate your privileges. \nIf you're in a terminal, then you can do sudo nano filename in order to edit it, or if you prefer using GUI applications, then you can press Alt+F2 and enter gksu gedit, which will run the text editor as the system administrator, which does have the right to edit any file.

It is not specific to Ubuntu but related to the kernel (we all share) and your hardware giving back wrong information to the kernel. \nExchange Redhat for Ubuntu in the text copied from the link and mind the 3 bullet points (maybe you can use that to circumvent this): \n\n\nSystems fail to boot, USB is not functional, network adapter fails to work (or possibly other symptoms) due to imperfect handling of\n  BIOSes with broken IOMMU handling\n  \n  \n*\n  \n*Bugzilla: #524808 and Bugzilla: #533952\nSome manufacturers ship systems with a BIOS whose handling of IOMMU\n  hardware is incorrect. The BIOS is supposed to tell the operating\n  system where in memory to find the IOMMU hardware, but some BIOSes do\n  not do so correctly, providing a garbage location or a location which\n  is valid but is not actually where the device is located. The kernel\n  attempts to handle these cases, but some were still not fully handled\n  in the Fedora 12 release kernel. If you have a system affected by this\n  problem, the most common symptom is that the USB subsystem will fail\n  to work (no USB peripherals will work), but other symptoms have\n  included systems that completely fail to boot, and non-functional\n  network adapters.\nThere are some systems currently known to be potentially affected by\n  this issue. For all of those except the HP xw4600 Workstation and the\n  Dell Precision M6400, all of the following conditions must be true\n  before you hit the bug:\n  \n  \n*\n  \n*You must be using the 32-bit edition of Fedora 12\n  \n*You must have no memory beyond the 4GB address area (practically speaking, this means you must have around 2.5GB of physical RAM or\n  less)\n  \n*Virtualization features (VT-d) must be disabled in the BIOS \n  \n  \n  If any of the above is not the case, you should not encounter this\n  issue. If you think you may be suffering from this issue, look for a\n  kernel log message including something similar to:\nYour BIOS is broken; DMAR reported at address fed10000 returns all ones!\n\nor:\nYour BIOS is broken; DMAR reported at address zero!\n\nPlease note that if you are using a system with such a broken BIOS,\n  the kernel message will always appear, even if the kernel in fact\n  handles your case correctly, or you have successfully worked around\n  the issue. So don't worry that you still see the message once you have\n  worked around the problem.\nThere are several ways to work around this issue. In most cases (see\n  above), installing the 64-bit edition of Fedora 12 would be enough. If\n  your BIOS has an option for it, enabling virtualization features in\n  the BIOS should also work around this problem. Finally, you can work\n  around this issue by appending the kernel parameter iommu=soft to your\n  boot configuration.\nAn updated kernel package has been released to address this issue.\n  Update your system as usual to receive this update, if you do not yet\n  already have it. Obviously, if you are affected by the problem, you\n  will need to use one of the above workarounds to first bring your\n  system to a state from which you can install a fixed kernel.\n\n", "Q: How to reboot automatically and run terminal command(s) on startup?

I have neither experience nor skills in dealing with operative systems.\nI entered this command line:\nsudo apt-get install gnome-shell ubuntu-gnome-desktop\n\nconsequently, the background changed to black (dark grey) and icons disappeared.\nI have no clues about how to get rid of this gnome and restore Unity which served me so well in at least three happy years of using Ubuntu without issues.\nSorry for my broken English.\nI hope you could help me, and I beg you not to scold me too much for my imprudence.\nThanks a lot\nAlberto Costa\n\nA: *\n\n*Login into virtual console and then run the below commands to remove gnome-shell and reinstall unity,\nsudo apt-get purge gnome-shell ubuntu-gnome-desktop\n\nsudo apt-get install --reinstall unity\nsudo apt-get install --reinstall ubuntu-desktop\nsudo apt-get autoremove\n\n\n*Then restart lightdm,\nsudo service lightdm restart\n\n", "Q: disk is full, but cannot find big files or folders Ubuntu server shows me that I  use almost all disk:\nUsage of /:   95.5% of 118.12GB\n\nAnd I try to find big folders and files, run ncdu:\nncdu 1.8 ~ Use the arrow keys to navigate, press ? for help                                                                                                                                                 \n--- / ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n    5.5GiB [##########] /root                                                                                                                                                                               \n    2.3GiB [####      ] /var\n  628.6MiB [#         ] /usr\n  209.9MiB [          ] /lib\n   28.2MiB [          ] /boot\n    8.6MiB [          ] /bin\n    7.7MiB [          ] /sbin\n    6.6MiB [          ] /etc\n  208.0KiB [          ] /run\n  112.0KiB [          ] /tmp\n   48.0KiB [          ] /opt\ne  16.0KiB [          ] /lost+found\n    8.0KiB [          ] /dev\n    8.0KiB [          ] /media\n    4.0KiB [          ] /lib64\ne   4.0KiB [          ] /srv\ne   4.0KiB [          ] /selinux\ne   4.0KiB [          ] /mnt\ne   4.0KiB [          ] /home\n    0.0  B [          ] /proc\n    0.0  B [          ] /sys\n@   0.0  B [          ]  initrd.img\n@   0.0  B [          ]  vmlinuz\n\nAccording to ncdu I use about 10 GiB of 128 GiB - it is about 10 %.

You'll have to kill that process to free up the space. You may be able to identify the process by using lsof. On Linux deleted yet open files are known to lsof and marked as (deleted) in lsof's output.\nYou can check this with sudo lsof +L1\nplease refer: https://serverfault.com/questions/315181/df-says-disk-is-full-but-it-is-not\n\nA: I was running into this same issue on our lab machines and using this command \ndu -sch .[!.]* * |sort -h\n\nI was able to find hidden files like inside of users trash bins that they had yet to delete.\nCredit to here where I originally found this answer.\n\nA: Check for deleted files that are still being held open by a process:\nsudo lsof | grep deleted | less\n\nThat'll show the pid and file descriptor. I had this exact problem on a server, nothing in ncdu but disk filling up. It turned out to be a nightly process that moved files to a mounted samba share and occasionally didn't close out the file handle correctly, it seems.\nIf you find deleted files and want to clean them up, a reboot is probably easiest if that's acceptable. Or you can try killing the process. Or if you're sure they're not being used, you can manually empty them out, with something like this:\n> /proc/14487/fd/12\n\nA: One reason for \"hidden\" big files is a possibility to mount a folder (to some other folder/resource residing on a different disk) - the whole content of the  original folder is kind of \"hidden\" - \"du\" won't show it, because it will be \"overlapped\" with the mounted resource.\n\nA: You can run the command below to find the top 10 files by disk usage:\nfind / -type f -printf '%s %p\\n' 2>&1 \\\n     | grep -v 'Permission denied' \\\n     | sort -nr \\\n     | head -10\n\n\nA: I was experiencing this issue myself. Disk full, completely unable to locate the offending directories and/or files. However, I did solve this puzzle.\nAll of the previous answers are extremely helpful and legitimate but if you are, like me, unable to find the offending directories and/or files using the tips above, I'd like to share my solution.\nI have an external USB drive (ex: dev/sdeX) that I used exclusively for backing up the content of root (ex: /dev/sdaX). Using that as a clue, I unmounted all mount points, excluding root and other required mount points. From there, I noticed the mount point to which the external USB drive mounts to is utilizing over 150G of space. Sure enough, I venture to this directory and see that it contains the same exact file structure and content as the external USB drive (when mounted). I mounted my external USB drive to verify backup data is intact (it is, check) then unmounted it and deleted the contents of that directory (for peace of mind, make sure to verify the mount point has been unmounted). Once I did that, usage on / (/dev/sdaX) went from 100% usage to 13%, which is right about what I expect.\nPoint of my answer... try unmounting all external drives and double check the mount point for data that should be on the external drive, not your root drive (/dev/sdaX).\nHope this helps.\n", "Q: ubuntu as guest in virtualbox at host with high DPI screen I was wondering, I like the fullscreen mode (host + f by default), but this is unfortunately not very helpful with a 3200x1800 resolution screen (15 inches). The scaling mode (host + C) is better, but not quite the same. what I want is something like fullscreen scaling, where you can set a maximum resolution, beyond that it scales to fit the screen. (at least I think I want something like this.)\nIf I had to pick a static resolution then that's ok too. (say i'd like to pick 1920x1080 for my 3200x1800 display), and then have this resolution stretched / scaled to fullscreen coverage. But how would I go about this?\nI hear there's the same kind of issue for others with retina displays where the dpi is so high that all of Ubuntu's icons / buttons and UI in general becomes too small for comfort. I feel that until Ubuntu officially supports high DPI screens, then scaling it from a virtualbox image must be achievable right?\nLast point... this might be an issue with the vbox additions driver auto adjusting the size of the ubuntu window to match that of the host...\nI've tried Oracle VM VirtualBox Manager -> File -> Preferences -> Display -> Maximum Guest Screen Size. Which seemed like it was exactly what I wanted, but it did not do anything.\nTL;DR: High DPI screen on host, ubuntu guest tries to match this = tiny UI & icons.\nAny help would be much appreciated! (the end result is to just want to use ubuntu on a high DPI screen, the path taken does not matter as much. However it seems like I would have most success through virtualbox here)\n\nA: In Ubuntu 17.10 in VirtualBox. set hiDPI, and scale to 100% in VirtualBox settings. Then open Ubuntu Settings Devices/Displays, Make you window big and you will see a new Gnome setting called scale. Set to 200% and Ubuntu will take full advantage of every pixel in high DPI screen like a mac retina.\nSee article at:  https://teklern.blogspot.com/2017/10/installing-ubuntu-17.html\n\nA: Ok, so my temporary solution (until Ubuntu supports high DPI i guess...) was to just go down in resolution on my host system (windows), to half the max resolution (1920x1080).\nI don't really want to mark this as solved, since it kinda bypasses the problem in an undesirable manner. (this is just what I'm content with doing.)\n\nA: Finally found a working solution.\nVitualbox -> (select guest) -> Settings -> Display -> Scale Factor \n\n\n", "Q: Removing dual boot and installing ubuntu 12.04.3 I had the dual boot: Windows 7 and Ubuntu 12.04.2.\nThen I tried to install ubuntu 12.04.2 on the entire hard disk.

I'm always confused to get the version of software installed in Ubuntu. To prevent from full typing to get the version like <software> --version instead I always use something like <software> -V.\nBut the problem is that not for all software it works. For some I've to use <software> -v and for some, I've to use full --version to get the version.\nFor example\nwget, gedit, nano, mysql`, etc all work with -V (Capital V)\nbut Php, Skype and may be others never worked with -V instead I've to use -v (small v) to get the version:\nphp -V\nUsage: php [options] [-f] <file> [--] [args...]\n   php [options] -r <code> [--] [args...]\n   php [options] [-B <begin_code>] -R <code> [-E <end_code>] [--] [args...]\n   php [options] [-B <begin_code>] -F <file> [-E <end_code>] [--] [args...]\n   ...\n\nphp -v\nPHP 5.3.10-1ubuntu3.9 with Suhosin-Patch (cli) (built: Dec 12 2013 04:27:25) \n...\n\nSome work with both -v and -V like firefox.

Libraries are a good example. You can't check your kernel version using linux --version, as there is no such command. Or your video driver version.\n\n*Not all executables have command-line arguments. Most do, but GUI programs don't need to, and some don't.\n\n*--version, as any command-line argument, is application-dependent. It depends on the developer to implement it, and there is no \"standard\" per-se, merely a convention. As you've noticed with -v|-V, it is not consistent. Even --help is not universal. \n\n*The format output of --version is not consistent either. Some print a single line, some print several. Some print the version number only, some print the program name too.\nThat said, there is a standard, consistent way to get the installed version of any software in your system: ask the system, not the sofware!\nThanks to its Debian heritage, Ubuntu has a powerful package management system called apt (actually, dpkg). It controls installed packages, its dependencies, available repositories, and versions.\nThere are several package-management tools and front-ends you can use to query your installed packages. Here are some that display the version:\n\n\n*\n\n*apt-cache policy <package>\n\n*dpkg --list <package> (you can use wildcards!)\nAnd if you don't know what package a given command belongs to, you can find out in several ways:\n\n\n*\n\n*apt-cache search '<name>'\n\n*apt-file search '<path>'\nAnd the output is always consistent, reliable, standard, because you're not asking individual software made by distinct developers, you're querying your system about its status.\nAs an example, here's the result of a search of all the commands your mentioned in a single output:\n$ dpkg --list wget gedit nano mysql-server skype php? firefox totem wine google-chrome*\n\n\nDesired=Unknown/Install/Remove/Purge/Hold\n| Status=Not/Inst/Conf-files/Unpacked/halF-conf/Half-inst/trig-aWait/Trig-pend\n|/ Err?=(none)/Reinst-required (Status,Err: uppercase=bad)\n||/ Name                       Version                    Description\n+++-==========================-==========================-====================================================================\nii  firefox                    42.0+build2-0ubuntu0.12.04 Safe and easy web browser from Mozilla\nii  gedit                      3.4.1-0ubuntu1             official text editor of the GNOME desktop environment\nii  google-chrome-stable       46.0.2490.80-1             The web browser from Google\nii  mysql-server               5.5.46-0ubuntu0.12.04.2    MySQL database server (metapackage depending on the latest version)\nii  nano                       2.2.6-1                    small, friendly text editor inspired by Pico\nii  php5                       5.3.10-1ubuntu3.21         server-side, HTML-embedded scripting language (metapackage)\nii  skype                      4.3.0.37-0ubuntu0.12.04.1  client for Skype VOIP and instant messaging service\nii  totem                      3.0.1-0ubuntu21.1          Simple media player for the GNOME desktop based on GStreamer\nii  wget                       1.13.4-2ubuntu1.2          retrieves files from the web\nii  wine                       1.4-0ubuntu4.1             Microsoft Windows Compatibility Layer (meta-package)\n\n\nA: Those are verbose options related to each application so some apps used the -V others use -v others both or just --version. There is no general rule for naming convention.\nwhat i mean to say is those options don't have a standard so you may find option -X in some app do the same as -R in other ...\n\nA: The standard is:\napp --version\n-v or -V is only (not generally speaking) the abbreviated form for --version. You will never see in a man page something like:\n-v\n    Print version...\nor:\n-V\n    Print version...\nbut you will see all the time these two options, the abbreviated form (if this exists) and the standard form, together. Something like:\n-v, --version\n    Print version...\nor:\n-V, --version\n    Print version...\nBut this depends only by developers how they want to implement their applications. For example -v is used in some cases as the abbreviated form for --verbose (see man wget), or for --invert-match (see man grep) a.o., or in other cases as stand alone (see man awk or man ps). \n\nA: It typically ends up being caused by an option called \"verbosity\". Verbosity runs a program and prints as much information as possible to the terminal from which it was called.\nSome programs, however, don't support verbose mode or don't run in a way that would require any form of verbosity, so they will spit out the help string. Others will treat -v and -V equally.\n", "Q: Ctrl+Alt+F1 - incorrect login I have pressed the keyboard combination Ctrl+Alt+F1, because I wanted to see the output of my commands as they were being executed, but I got the following error: incorrect login.\n\nA: The most common cause of this error is simply typing your password wrong. The keymap in the console is often subtly different from the one in X.\nMake sure you're typing the correct password by first typing it in the login field where you can see if it's being written as expected.\n\nAnother thing that will cause this exact same error message is if your login shell is not listed in /etc/shells. Find which shell you're using by searching for your username in /etc/passwd:\ngrep \"dave\" /etc/passwd\n\n(replacing dave with your username) you should see something like this:\ndave:x:1000:1000::/home/dave:/bin/zsh\n\nThe last field (/bin/zsh) is your shell. Let's search for it in /etc/shells:\ngrep \"/bin/zsh\" /etc/shells\n\nWe should see something like this:\n/bin/zsh\n/usr/bin/zsh\n\nBut if you don't, that's what the problem is. Try re-installing zsh (or whatever shell is missing from /etc/shells), and if that doesn't work, add it manually:\necho `/bin/zsh` | sudo tee /etc/shells\n\n(we use tee because > redirection doesn't work with sudo)\n\nA: I solved that issue typing the numbers of my password not withe the right-side number keypad, but with the number keys that are over the letters.\n\nA: Check Number Lock And Caps Lock\nAnd You can try this too\nOpen the Terminal Application And Enter Following Code\nsudo dpkg-reconfigure console-setup \n\nAnd choose the right layout there.\n\nA: Ctrl+Alt+F1 is the first virtual console provided by the getty/agetty programs, sometimes called tty1.\nTo login there you must to use your Ubuntu user name and the password associated with this user name.

I can't seem to load Windows 7. I just started and set up a dual boot of Windows 7 and Ubuntu. My windows was working fine before installing Ubuntu. However now whenever I select the Windows loader option in the Grub menu it won't work. It will appear like its starting to load but then after a few minutes it will take me to the startup repair screen (I think that's what its called). After several minutes of waiting it says that it can't repair it and suggests using the system repair disc...which I don't have. \nI've have searched and tried several different \"solutions\" to no success. Is there a way I can create a System Repair disc using a USB drive from Ubuntu?? Doesn't seem possible to me.  \nOr could it be that Grub isn't loading Windows 7 correctly? Is there anyway I can just bypass Grub? Or not use it at all. Maybe what I'm trying to ask is can I boot Windows 7 directly from the BIOS menu or something?\nI wish I never had even considered dual booting and should have just stuck to a virtual machine.\nCan anyone help?? \n\nA: As a temporary solution, you can always select the Windows entry, hit e, then find /dev/sdb1 and change it to /dev/sdb2. If you want the modification to become permanent, look for example at How do I change the GRUB boot order? or, better, at Grub points to recovery partition instead of install partition.\n", "Q: Upon installation crash, cannot close window to file bug report.

I attempted to close the window so that the reporting tool could open, but I cannot get the window to close.\nWhat is the next step in order to properly install the Ubuntu software?\n\nA: If the crash happens at a stage of setting \"language, time zone or region\", unplug the Ethernet cable to disconnect the laptop from the network/Internet. Then repeat the installation.\n", "Q: Ubuntu cannot be booted from external hard disk on another computer I have recently installed Ubuntu 13.10 on a external hard disk by using a Windows 8 laptop. I wanted it to be accessible from any other computers. But I found that there were 2 \"Ubuntu\"s at the boot manager screen even the external hard disk was not connected. Seems it is recognized as dual-boot. Later, I tried to boot it from another computer (Windows 7 desktop). The Ubuntu 13.10 inside cannot be loaded.\nI can't find any other solutions, so I post it here. Hoping somebody can help me out.\nP/S: Both the partition and the swap area are set as Primary Drive.\n\nA: When you installed Ubuntu on the external HD your bootloader has probably been replaced with Grub and the Ubuntu entries where added. One of the entries boots Ubuntu (when HD is connected of course) in normal mode, the other entry start Ubuntu in rescue mode without graphical wrapper.\nIt's not suprising that Ubuntu won't load by default on an other computer. This bootloader doesn't know about Ubuntu on the external HD and therefore Ubuntu won't show up as option during boot. Now your system boots from (internal) HD. You can boot Ubuntu when you give your external HD a higher boot priority than your internal HD. You can set this in your BIOS.  \n", "Q: Why is the size of update manager different from time to time? At the first time, I installed ubuntu 12.04 on my desktop and ran the update manager. At that time, the size of the update is about 168 MB. Then I did something wrong on device installation, so I decided to re-install ubuntu by erasing the previous one. But what I noticed was that when I ran the update manager on the new ubuntu, the total size of the update is now about 100MB, not 168MB. So now I am wondering if there's something broken on the last installation, because the size of the update is smaller than the previous one's...\nPlease tell me whether this is a fault at installation or I can ignore this and proceed\nThank you\n=====================================================================\nOK. This is not a fault. I did three installations on the same machine, all without internet connection, and then later ran the update manager. Then the size of the update was identical for every installation. It looks like sometimes, updates during installation from internet differ from time to time, but as a whole, there is nothing wrong with it. \n\nA: Most probably there was broken update that included unnecessary data files. Without more information, it's hard to know what exactly happened.\nFor example, maintainer could have pushed update for graphics files (say, background images) that only included some trivial changes. Later that was reverted.\nOr on the second time, your Ubuntu automatically downloaded part of the update, and thus showed only 100MB for download size.\n", "Q: Copy current terminal prompt to clipboard Is there a way to copy the currently written content of the bash prompt?

Is that possible?\nThe usual usecase would be hitting up several times and finding a command which I want to copy.\n\nA: *\n\n*Add a # to the front of the command (so it becomes a comment)\n\n*Run it\n\n*Grab it from the history and pipe it to a clipboard utillity like\nxclip: history | tail -n 1 | sed \"s/[[:digit:]]*  //\" | sed \"s/^#//\" | xclip\n\nA: To cut, press ctrl+u. To paste, use ctrl+y. This copies whole line to bash clipboard. If you're using X and default Ubuntu terminal, you can use your mouse to mark contents and press ctrl+shift+c to copy, and ctrl+shift+v to paste.\n\nA: If you don't mind using the mouse, just triple click on the line you want to copy then press Ctrl+Shift+C. You can then paste it with Ctrl+V.\n\nA: Vi mode solution\nKeyboard-only solution. All characters are copied exactly \"as-is\". Out of the box - pure shell solution, no dependencies (except xsel obviously).\nSetup\n\n*\n\n*Set vi option in terminal: set -o vi.\n\n*Alias copying unclosed here-document: alias c2c='cat - <<\"\" | tr -d '\"'\"'\\n'\"'\"' | xsel -b'\nUsage\n\n*\n\n*Write anything you want to the command line without pressing <return>.\n\n*Press <escape> followed by <d>, <d>.

Deleted text can be now pasted anywhere by pressing <ctrl>+<v> (GUI), or <ctrl>+<shift>+<v> (reasonable CLI). If Your CLI isn't reasonable, make it so.\nfzf solution\nSome likes like vi mode, others not really. But I think fuzzy finder is must have. It doesn't allow to do exactly what you've asked, it can do something better! Instead of \"hitting up several times\" fzf can browse command history with order of magnitude better efficiency. Moreover, it can be used inside my c2c alias to copy to clipboard. Whatever is typed to the terminal at the moment cannot be nicely copied (without mouse), but if something is in history, it is a matter of seconds to get it.\n\nA: In xfce4-terminal, you need to select with the mouse the text you'd like to copy, then right-click and then select the Copy item in the context-menu. \nDoes this work? \n\nA: Not sure why all answers are so complicated, from bash 4.0 you can access current content with $READLINE_LINE.

If your window manager places desktop icons on the left, then they will jump to the far left-hand monitor.\nHowever, if you use KDE as your desktop manager/window manager, you can use \"FolderView\" as your desktop setting. This way, you can arrange icons exactly as you wish on either monitor and they will stay put.\nI have tried most of the major desktop environments, including Cinnamon, Gnome 2, Gnome Classic (Gnome-Session-Fallback), Gnome 3, KDE, LXDE, MATE, Unity, and Xfce. Among these, KDE is the only one I have tried that enables me to use my right-hand monitor as the primary display while also keeping my desktop icons on the right-hand display.\nIf you want to stay with Xfce, a workaround I have used in that desktop environment is to install screenlets and use the folderview screenlet to put a window on my right-hand monitor that is set to the Desktop folder. This way, I can see the icons that are on the far-left in the screenlet window. With this screenlet, I can also open, copy, paste, or delete files that appear in the Desktop folder.\n\nA: I wrote iconic to solve this problem and others. It will:\n\n\n*\n\n*Allow you to move icons to any of three monitors\n\n*Not suffer the \"lost icon syndrome\" that occurs when monitors of multiple resolutions are used\n\n*Sort icons alphabetically, alphabetically with \"Link to\" prefix ignored, sort by modified date ascending or date descending\n\n*Allow different grid size (columns x rows) depending on monitor, EG more on 4K monitor than 2K monitor\n\n*Instant Test button for quick experimentation on column x row changes or reserved space changes for monitor left, top, right or bottom areas\n\n*Test button will last for x seconds defined by you, clear all windows before test and restore them after test\n\n*Bash script for easy modifications\n\n\nYou can get the script on github.\nHere's the main screen:\n\nVisit the github page for iconic to see all the other screens, explanations and a copy of the script.\n", "Q: Is is safe to let Ubuntu resize my Windows partition during installation?

I put this as first since where I am that would be easiest to do (lots of people getting rid of machines good enough for what you described, often for free).\n\n*Virtual Machine with Windows and Word (can be created just based on your current setup, provided you have installer discs still) that you may boot from GNU/Linux.\n\n*What commenters have said: backup data, test Libre Office, switch completely. \n\n\nLast option is nicely described in comments, so for brevity I shall write about other things in more detail.\nHow to test Libre Office\nI'd go with Live CD, or took documents that I care for to a friend and played on his computer for 30 minutes - that should be quite enough to see what you get from your docx when they are opened / changed / printed from Libre.\nCheap typing PC\nUsed store, from a friend, companies also often sell out their old machines quite cheaply, or - if you like, some folks do - buy parts and put them together.\nRequires: installers for Windows and Word, time, perhaps some bucks.\nVM with Windows\nDownload VirtualBox (GPLv2 for users and FOSS, has commercial licence for commercial usages)  and create your own VM for your host. There are many good tutorials how to do it and I encourage you to try that out. It ain't scary or difficult at all, though for some it sounds intimidating. What you need:\n\n\n*\n\n*know the system / architecture the VM will be hosted on (probably Ubuntu, only question is whether your architecture is 32 or 64 bit, that should be in your board manual)\n\n*know the system you want VM to have.\n\n\nVM generally emulates computer on a physical computer, so you may have Linux on Linux, or Windows on Linux, or the other way around. That way you will run Windows with Word, but it will be run using Linux. Apology if I'm stating the obvious, I don't know what you know about VMs. :-)\nRequires: time, installers, perhaps some learning, VirtualBox. My first VM took me 20 minutes to create plus time for installing it's system and soft I needed there.

I recently went on an extended holiday and wanted to take my laptop to edit and organise photos with Shotwell, so I copied all the photos to an external disk and copied across the Shotwell database to my laptop. With appropriate symlinks, this all worked fine. Shotwell though nothing had changed. I also made a backup of the database at this point. \nI then thought that I might as well import new photos to my laptop's internal hard drive to save me from having to lug around an external one. So I detached the external one, and when I next opened Shotwell all of the photos were marked as \"Missing\". As expected. I spent several months importing new photos and tagging them and making edits, exclusively using external programs from Shotwell and saving the edits as _modified.jpg. This all went just fine, I was assuming that Shotwell would pick up the missing photos when I eventually reconnected the disk. \nTo my horror, I found that this did not go quite as smoothly as I wanted. When I got home and re-attached the external disk, Shotwell did re-scan the photos - but lost all of the references to my edited photos. I have filed a bug for this . \nI have a backup of the database which correctly has all of my edits from before I went on holidays, and I have a backup of the database with all of my new edits. Is there a way to merge these to correct the missing edits? \nP.S. The take-home message is: ALWAYS HAVE BACKUPS! \nShotwell has a bug where the \"editable_id\" field of the records in the \"phototable\" of the sqlite database is erased when the photo goes missing. This is easily fixed by restoring the automatic photos.db.bk, but is a big issue if you continue to import and edit photos. \n\nA: OK, I've figured it out. The general idea was to copy the new parts of the database to the old one, thus having a fully working database. Throughout I refer to the \"old\" photos/database as the one that worked before removing the storage, and the \"new\" photos/database as the ones that work after a certain date (which probably has a different storage location, or were added after photos were deleted) but where the \"old\" photos don't work properly. Hopefully this makes sense. :) \nFor this to work, you need to have already made backups of the Shotwell database. So I'm assuming you know a little about where that is stored.\n\nPreparation\nMake backups of everything!  I'm not kidding, there are no guarantees this will work. \nThe first step is to install sqliteman \nsudo apt-get install sqliteman\n\nAfter that, open your back-up Shotwell database using Sqliteman. Then enter this into the input box:\nSELECT id, filename, flags FROM phototable;\n\nPress F9 to run the command. You should see references to all of your photos appear in the scroll box. Scroll to the bottom, and verify that the last photo has a \"flags\" field of \"0\". This indicates that the file is present and working the last time Shotwell ran. \nMake a note of the last ID value. Let's call it \"phototable_max\".\nNow, delete the previous command and run this one: \nSELECT id, filepath, flags FROM backingphototable;\n\nThis shows you all of the edits you have made. Again, make note of the last ID value. Call it \"backingphototable_max\".\nAgain delete the command and run this:\nSELECT id, name FROM eventtable;\n\nYou will see the list of events. Once again, note the last value. This one is \"eventtable_max\". \nThis is getting a little repetitive, but now delete the command and run this:\nSELECT id, name FROM tagtable;\n\nNote the highest value. \"tagtable_max\". \nOK, so now we have the ID numbers that worked in Shotwell before we broke it. After this point I'm assuming that the database works - i.e. after the point you made the backup all of the photos were not marked as missing. \n\nSQLite time!\nNow to copy the new database into the old one.\nDefinitely make several backups of your backups. There is a fair chance you will mess this up. You don't want to lose your Shotwell database forever. \nOK, close Sqliteman. It's time for some CLI work. Here I am assuming that your old shotwell database is located at \"~/.local/share/shotwell-old/data/photo.db\" and the new one at \"~/.local/share/shotwell-new/data/photo.db\"\nsqlite3 ~/.local/share/shotwell-old/data/photo.db\n\nNow you will have an SQLite prompt. Into this, enter:\nATTACH \"/home/sean/.local/share/shotwell-new/data/photo.db\" AS new;\n\nDon't forget the ; and obviously replace \"sean\" with your username. And yes, you have to use the full path. \nNow we can just do these commands, and you're all done! You have to replace the _max values with the ones you noted earlier.\nINSERT INTO phototable SELECT * FROM new.phototable WHERE new.phototable.id > phototable_max;\nINSERT INTO backingphototable SELECT * FROM new.backingphototable WHERE new.backingphototable.id > backingphototable_max;\nINSERT INTO eventtable SELECT * FROM new.eventtable WHERE new.eventtable.id > eventtable_max;\nINSERT INTO tagtable SELECT * FROM new.tagtable WHERE new.tagtable.id > tagtable_max;\nDELETE FROM videotable;\nINSERT INTO videotable SELECT * FROM new.videotable;\n\nWhat we are doing here is copying across all of the newer values into the old working database from the working part of the new database. The last two lines delete and then copy the videotable, which sorts itself out just fine when restoring missing files. \nThen press Ctrl+D to close the sqlite3 interpreter. \nYou can now move the photo.db file to the Shotwell location, at \"~/.local/share/shotwell/data/photo.db\" and open Shotwell and it should all work! Make sure you have your hard drive or external storage connected this time. \n\nI found Shotwell ran a little slowly once I first opened it, but it did eventually re-cache everything and got going again. \nAlso, note that I think because of how we copied the tags table and existing tags applied to new photos would have been lost. Any new tags should survive though, and likewise all old tags on old photos would survive too. This is because of the strange way Shotwell stores tag information - each tag record in the database stores which photos it tags. \n", "Q: Installation via a network switch (Ethernet) How do you install Ubuntu via a network switch (on mass)? \nDo you need a certain program? if so what and where can I get it?\nI will be using Ubuntu 13.10 network installer.\nThe reason I'm asking this is because I cannot find it in the install details.

The tutorial is called Installing Ubuntu 13.10 by Marius Nestor.\nIn my opinion the best advice for installing Ubuntu is to make sure you have a working internet connection. If necessary run the live Ubuntu DVD/USB and start the Ubuntu installer from it. You can open Firefox from the live DVD/USB and check that you have a working internet connection before you start the Ubuntu installer. In the Ubuntu installer there are options to install many different packages that you would normally need all together with a single click. This will save you a lot of time compared to installing all of the same packages one at a time using the Ubuntu Software Center. You can also download all the updates while you are still in the Ubuntu installer, so that Ubuntu will be completely up to date before you restart and run it for the first time.\n", "Q: Publishing to web from Shotwell in XFCE There are similar questions on this site  but none of them answers mine.

Hope this helps!\n\nA: Sometimes I had issues booting my computer if I have anything connected to the usb ports (even a simple keyboard and mouse :S) if that doesn't help then try setting acpi=off in the boot line of grub.\n", "Q: Delete Files Older Than One year on Linux By the time, many files are still on my system and I don't need them anymore, so how to delete all files that are one year old at least?\n\nA: You can do it with this command\nfind /path/to/files* -mtime +365 -exec rm {} \\;\n\nSome explain\n/path/to/files* is the path to the files. \n-mtime is used to specify the number of days old that the file is. +365 will find files older than 365 days which is one year\n-exec allows you to pass in a command such as rm.\n\nEdit \nThanks to @Oli note --> you can do it by:\nfind /path/to/files* -mtime +365 -delete\n\n", "Q: libwebkitgtk-1.0-0 package In my software I am using libwebkitgtk-1.0-0 package, which is necessary for proper running of my Software. I had this package installed on all my Laptops. But when I tried to install the Software on another laptop where this package was NOT present, my software was not running properly. Then I installed the package. \nI am giving this software to some of my friends who will use it daily. 1-2 of them are from remote areas where they hardly get internet. So I thought that I will provide this package separately. But I could not get it. Can anybody tell me how to resolve this issue ?\nWhere can I get the libwebkitgtk-1.0-0 so that I can provide it within the CD ?\n\nA: The package is in the Ubuntu main archive. You can download it with apt-get download libwebkitgtk-1.0-0 or by going to the source package's page on Launchpad, and downloading from there, for the appropriate architecture.\nHowever, it would probably be better to update your program to use GTK+ 3.x and libwebkitgtk-3.0-0 instead, which is included by default on the Ubuntu install. GTK+ 2.x is deprecated and it is not recommended to write new software with it at this time, and is recommended to port applications to GTK+ 3.x if possible.\n", "Q: \"packages have unmet dependencies\" while installing Code::Blocks While trying to install Code::Blocks, I run sudo apt-get install libwxgtk2.8-dev, but then receive an error listing many \"unmet dependencies\" for several packages.\nThe full list of errors:\nReading package lists...

Yesterday, my mele a1000g single core mini pc arrived in the mail. I tried to use berryboot to install Ubuntu, but it didn't work. So, I dd'd the image of ARM Ubuntu specific for my device to an SD Card. I used the SD Card to transfer that image to the NAND Partition and can now boot Ubuntu without the SD Card. Anyway, it boots quickly, but I cannot see the entire desktop. I can see a sliver of the menu, but none of the text or anything and I have no idea what I am doing. For the most part, all that I can see is the Ubuntu icon in the center of the screen on a black backround. I am used to windows 7. So, I would like some way to resize the desktop slightly smaller so that I can see the entire thing. I have tried changing the display mode on my monitor, but it only resizes the image that it was originally displaying and it doesn't add any more of the edges of the desktop that weren't being displayed. So, that is a useless idea. I would prefer some sort of graphical way of doing this, as I can't do much of anything in the text only environment except typing \"startx\" and booting Ubuntu. Keep in mind that this is ARM Ubuntu 12.10 running on the mele a1000g single core. I am using the image from this link: http://www.guillaumeplayground.net/mele-a2000-ubuntu-12-10-armhf-nand-xbmc/\nAlso, Some users of my device have had trouble accessing all of their RAM when booting with this image. For some reason Ubuntu only recognizes 512 mb of the 1 gb RAM that this device has. I would like a quick way to check how much RAM Ubuntu is running on/able to access. Last Question :) Does Ubuntu come with a web browser and how do I find and run it? If not, how would I go about installing one? Thanks so much for all of your help! Keep in mind that I am a complete beginner. \n\nA: Please try to ask only one question per thread. \nTo know what RAM your hardware has, you can launch : \nsudo lshw\n\nand look at the *-memory line. This will tell you haw much RAM your motherboard has, and also exactly how they are placed. \n\nIn my case, for example, it says I have 8 GB installed, and the detail\n  tells me I have 4x 2 GB at 1066Mhz\n\n\nAnother way to do this, but that is the RAM your Ubuntu uses, it's to launch : \nfree -h\n\nMem table tells you how many RAM your system has, and -/+ buffers/cache how much is used currently. \n", "Q: How to use Vlc with sudo privileges? I'm trying to use Vlc with sudo but it doesn't work.\nThis is the error: \nVLC is not supposed to be run as root.

I can access Movies,Documents files using nautilus with sudo. But to play these files I need VLC with sudo. I think it's a good reason.\n\n\nA: You will be able to run VLC as root by modifying the VLC binary, located in /usr/bin\nFirst, you'll need a hex-editor, like Bless :\nsudo apt-get install bless\n\nThen, you'll open the VLC binary with the hex-editor :\nsudo bless /usr/bin/vlc\n\nSearch and change the geteuid string by getppid, save and exit. \nYou can now launch VLC as root. \n\nA: Sudo is your friend, it is there to protect you. If you really just don't want to type your password and you don't care about the security then you should look into ssh-agent. It can save your password so you will only need to type your password once per session.\n\nA: You really should not be logged in as root all the time. End of story. A lot of programs and applications will detect this and refuse to run, because it's bad practice.\nIf the only reason you have to run as root is to avoid being bothered to enter your password when you run a potentially system-damaging command (also there for your protection), you can simply configure sudo to not require the password all the time.\nYou will still have to type \"sudo\" before running some commands, but it will not ask for the password.\nBu default you should already be in the sudo group, so just do this:\nvisudo\n\nThen look for this line:\n%sudo   ALL=(ALL:ALL) ALL\n\nChange it to:\n%sudo   ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD: ALL\n\nThen save the file and exit. Then it will not ask for your password every time.\n\nA: \nBut to play these files I need VLC with sudo.

I already do it via SSH, but would now like a GUI.\nDo people recommend I use vnc or SSH with a gui?\n\nA: VNC by itself is generally considered insecure, partly because some clients/servers limit the password length to 8 characters. SSH is generally only terminal, but there is a feature called X11 Forwarding, which can forward any X11 application windows you open on the remove computer on your own desktop.\nHowever, you can use VNC over an SSH connection. This gives you the benefits of a VNC connection (full control of desktop, etc.) while making it much more secure, as the connection will be encrypted by your SSH private key (hopefully, unless you're just using a password). This works by forwarding port 5900 on the remote computer to port 5900 on your remote computer in SSH. Then, in your VNC client, you use 127.0.0.1 (loopback address) as the IP address and 5900 as the port, and enter the password (if any). There should be several guides on the internet about this.\n", "Q: Ubuntu freeze after moving window to the side When I move a window to the left or right side, it should automatically resize itself (I don't know how this function is called, but it is also present on windows 7).

Last night, I mistakenly installed the 32-bit OS while I intended to install the 64 bit. Just before doing so, I took an image of Windows 7 64 in case something went wrong. \nI want to upgrade to 64 bit version of Ubuntu while keeping W7 64. Is there a way for me to easily do this? If I use my 64 bit live disk, will the 64 bit version overwrite the 32 bit?\nAlternatively, could I just recover the PC from the image I took before installing Ubuntu, wiping everything clean INCLUDING 32-bit Ubuntu (then install 64)? Or will the W7 recovery ignore Ubuntu all together? \nThanks All!\n\nA: Yes, if you attempt to install the 64 bit image it should give you the option to overwrite the 32 bit one. If memory serves me correctly, it is pretty friendly and you get presented with the option to keep windows and overwrite the ubuntu installation.

My computer has 1GB ram and a very end low graphics card, but I don't know how much power it has.\nUnity is very slow on my computer, and I saw that there are many desktop environments which are much lighter and faster, even for a slow computer.\nSo, what's the lightest desktop environment?\n\nA: There are two major Desktop Enviroments that you could describe as lightweight.\nFirst of all there is Xfce is used by Xubuntu and there is LXDE which is used by Lubuntu.\nLXDE seems to be a little faster than Xfce but this little boost costs a lot of functionality. Xfce is also really fast but with more functionality.\nThere are probably more and better Desktop Enviroments for your purpose but these are the major ones.\n\nA: Definitely Lxde\nor Xfce. \nFirst remove Unity with this command (make a backup before proceeding for safety!):\nsudo apt-get autoremove --purge unity unity-common unity-services unity-lens-\\* unity-scope-\\* unity-webapps-\\* gnome-control-center-unity hud libunity-core-6\\* libunity-misc4 libunity-webapps\\* appmenu-gtk appmenu-gtk3 appmenu-qt\\* overlay-scrollbar\\* activity-log-manager-control-center firefox-globalmenu thunderbird-globalmenu libufe-xidgetter0 xul-ext-unity xul-ext-webaccounts webaccounts-extension-common xul-ext-websites-integration gnome-control-center gnome-session\n\nthen:\nsudo rm /usr/lib/thunderbird-addons/extensions/messagingmenu@mozilla.com.xpi\n\nNow, to install Lxde run this command:\nsudo apt-get install lubuntu-desktop\nor for Xfce this one:\nsudo apt-get install xubuntu-desktop\n\nLastly, reboot and enjoy!\nHope this helped you.\n\nA: If you want the lightest options, I personally love Openbox or Fluxbox!\nCheck out Crunchbang Linux which uses Openbox as it's default. I have it running on my netbook like a champ!\n\nA: Short answer: Lxde. For optimal performance install the Lubuntu from the minimal media. You can download it from here: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Lubuntu/Documentation/MinimalInstall\n\nA: LXDE is the lightest, though Xbuntu is close and is better looking imo.\n\nA: The real answer is: NO Desktop Environment.\nDepending on what you want to do, running shell only might be a decent choice.\nYou can use something like fbterm to split your screen into multiple sections\n\nAnd there are shell programs that allow you to surf the web, view PDFs and play music as well. \nDisclaimer: That isn't my desktop screenshot, My shell only laptop is a work in progress, however I know someone who has successfully set this up, so I know what I'm talking about.\nDisclaimer 2: I don't think the shell web browsers play well with Stack Exchange.\n\nA: As other users have answered, LXDE is the lightest option. My input, however, would be that it definitely makes sense to do a clean install of lubuntu as a whole OS, replacing your ubuntu system. \nThe lubuntu OS comes packaged with many lightweight programs that maximize efficiency (though you can still install all of your heavier favorites because lubuntu uses the same software sources as regular ubuntu), has very little bloatware, and the entire system is built from the ground up specifically to be lightweight. Also, many of the applications it comes with integrate very well with LXDE specifically. I think that this is the best way to get the most out of low-spec machines. \nYou can download it here and use unetbootin to make a live CD or flash drive.\n\nA: This question has been answered widely in the forum;\nWhy not try Lightweight-XDE Ubuntu (Lubuntu) ?\nAlso have a look at these posts:\nLightweight desktop environments\nor\nlightweight window manager/desktop environment similar to Unity\nIn each of them you can see lots of suggested/related posts in the right corner of the page.\n", "Q: Software updates for 13.04 I am running 13.04.\nI opened Software Updater.

This seems to have happened ever since upgrading from 13.04 to 13.10 - for whatever reason, a variety of different things are causing it to crash out.\nThe two main triggers that cause a crash are:\n\n\n*\n\n*Opening a file of the same type as initially started in (e.g. opening a .odt file if I've started in Writer mode, a .ods file in Calc or a .odp file in Impress). Cross extensions (e.g. starting in Calc, and opening a .odp to switch to Impress) are fine. Once one file is open, however, I can open as many as I like of any type on top of it.\n\n*Closing any LibreOffice window will cause all of them to crash (it will come up with a recovery dialog for any file that was open).\n\n\nI've seen other causes too (even opening the Save As dialog has done it a couple of times) but these are not as consistent. I don't get any kind of error report dialog like I normally would; I think it must have auto-checked \"don't show me these\" at some point so I'm not getting the error dumps any more.\nI have no idea what's causing this, but I'd very much like to fix it if possible. I've tried fully reinstalling LibreOffice (sudo apt-get purge libreoffice*, followed by sudo apt-get install libreoffice), but to no avail - it continues to crash without fail whenever I perform one of the triggers above (not exactly uncommon actions). Any help would be much appreciated.\nEDIT: I have also tried running from a terminal, using libreoffice --writer etc., but get no additional outputs or error messages that would help. I only know that it's crashing on close because it opens the recovery manager the next time I start it (even if there was only a single, blank document open, it will do this on close)\nEDIT #2: I am still completely stuck with this. I have tried the command listed in Reinstall package and its installed dependencies to reinstall all of the dependencies, as well as purging entirely and installing from the PPA, all to no avail. The only difference now is that, with the version from the PPA, Libreoffice now crashes before it even loads a blank document, rather than when trying to open a file.\n\nA: You could try to upgrade to 4.1.4.2.\nFirst, completely uninstall your LibreOffice :\nsudo apt-get remove --purge libreoffice\nsudo apt-get -y autoremove \nsudo apt-get autoclean\n\nThen remove the files that have been left : \nsudo rm -r $HOME/.config/libreoffice\nsudo rm -r /usr/share/libreoffice\n\nInstall 4.1.4 through PPA (4.2 if 13.10 or 12.04) : \nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:libreoffice/ppa\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get install libreoffice\n\nI don't have any issues on 13.10 (32 bits + Unity)\n", "Q: Help with grub2 booting ubuntu My ubuntu system fails to boot after modifying file /etc/default/grub, even if I withdraw the modification later.\nI have a PC with four operating systems: 1. Ubuntu with grub2; 2, Centos; 3, Debian; and 4 gentoo.\nThe one that that crashes is Ubuntu. That is why I post the question here. \nDue to a recent update from gentoo that requires the installation of systemd, I need to change the configuration of grub2 installed in ubuntu, specifically two steps:\nModfication 1: add extra lines:\n    init=/usr/lib/systemd/systemd\n\nto the menuentry of gentoo in /boot/grub/grub.cfg. This modification will definately not impact the boot of other systems.\nModfication 2: add\n    GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX=\"init=/usr/lib/systemd/systemd\"\n\nin /etc/default/grub of Ubuntu system, which systemd is not installed. of course the second modification is not right to my case because in ubuntu there is no systemd installed (these is nothing in /usr/lib/systemd/systemd of ubuntu).\nHowever, the second modification becomes a troublemaker. After adding this line, the system fails to boot into ubuntu (the grub menu still works). Realizing the problem, I decide to withdraw the second modification. However, when I boot ubuntu again, the system freezes with the following screen:\n Target filesystem desn't have requested /usr/lib/systemd/systemd\n busybox v1.20.2 (Debian 1:1.20.0-7) multi-call binary\n Usage: switch_root '-c /dev/console] NEW_ROOT NEW_INIT [ARGS}\n Free initramfs and switch to another root fs:\n Chroot to NEW_ROOT, delete all in /, move NEW_ROOT to /.\n execute NEW_INIT. PID must be 1 NEW_ROOT must be a mountpoint. \n\n -c DEV reopen stdio to DEV\n\nThe reset can only be done by switching off and then on the pc, not rather by ctrl+alt+del.\nThis problem is 100% reproducable. As ubuntu fails to work, I installed grub2 from debian system. The exactly the same screen appears after I conducted the modification 2 on /etc/default/grub in debian system and rebooted debian with modification withdrawn.\nCan any one please give help on this issue? now only centos is working, from which I am writting this help question in askubuntu.\n\nA: the file \n /etc/default/grub\n\nis used to store the default grub parameters when using update-grub. as the comment line in /etc/default/grub says:\n# If you change this file, run 'update-grub' afterwards to update\n# /boot/grub/grub.cfg.\n# For full documentation of the options in this file, see:\n#   info -f grub -n 'Simple configuration'\n\nOf course if you add:\n init=/usr/lib/systemd/systemd\n\nin /etc/default/grub, after running update-grub, you will have init=/usr/lib/systemd/systemd for every menuentry. for example:\nmenuentry 'Debian GNU/Linux, with Linux 2.6.32-5-amd64' --class debian --class gnu-linux --class gnu --class os {\n    load_video\ninsmod gzio\ninsmod part_msdos\ninsmod ext2\nset root='(hd0,msdos8)'\nsearch --no-floppy --fs-uuid --set=root ca645602-ca68-498a-87d2-46cf205285dc\necho    'Loading Linux 2.6.32-5-amd64 ...'\nlinux   /boot/vmlinuz-2.6.32-5-amd64 root=UUID=ca645602-ca68-498a-87d2-46cf205285dc ro init=/usr/lib/systemd/systemd quiet\necho    'Loading initial ramdisk ...'\ninitrd  /boot/initrd.img-2.6.32-5-amd64\n}\n\nwhich can not boot debian without systemd installed.\n", "Q: What does \"No bootable medium found\" mean in VirtualBox? I have recently been trying to install VirtualBox, when this message came up:\nNo bootable medium found!\n\nCan somebody please tell me what went wrong?\n\nA: Assuming you had created a virtual hard drive, and installed Ubuntu onto this drive as depicted in answers to the following question:\n\n\n*\n\n*How to install Ubuntu on VirtualBox?\nThen if you finished you installation, and removed your installation ISO from the virtual CD bay you should be able to boot from this hard drive.\nThis of course can only be done in case you had included this drive's image in the virtual box machine's \"Storage\" settings where you can attach the VDI image of your installation to either a virtual IDE, or a virtual SATA port:\n\nIn addition we need to make sure you had not disabled booting from your hard drive in the System > Boot Order settings of your virtual machine:\n\n\nA: This message simply means that you haven't told your virtual machine where to find its OS. \nIn the Virtual Machine window, go to Storage, and medium.  see image below.\n\n\nA: if you have (as it seems to me to understand) installed virtualbox and created a vm in it, then you must configure it, network and storage, if your vm is brand new.\nIf you get no bootable medium, it means that in your vm both the HDU and the CDU are empty (it can mean too that your vm HDU hasn't any boot record or any OS on).\nCheers,\nSilvia\n\nA: When you're first creating the Virtual Machine, be sure to choose Linux as the type and Ubuntu as the version.\n\nI chose Windows by accident and it was giving me that error.\n\nA: Although I have accepted the answers above,  I realize that from the point of view of a complete noob to linux and operating systems in general, the concept of images ,ISO files etc is still confusing. I remember it taking me a while even after reading them. Primarily because Ubuntu had been installed on my PC by a friend, and I had zero experience there.\nSo  I will try to answer it as simply as possible, for anyone in my position :-\nWhen you install VirtualBox, it does not automatically come with the ability to run all the listed operatings systems (as I used to think ).  An external file called the ISO or system image file is needed.This is the \"bootable medium \" referenced above .It  generally has the .iso file extension. This file can be found on the website of the OS you want, and must be downloaded. This file is also used if you actually want to install the particular OS on your PC/laptop.\nYou  can read more about them here\nNow you must include/select this file as the virtual hard disk/ medium file as shown in the answers above.\n\nA: I had this problem when I was trying to get my own VM up and running. I had downloaded a VDI file off of OSBoxes and was attempting to use that to create a VM. \nWhen you create your own VM, make sure that, when prompted for the creation of a Virtual Hard Disk, you select:\n\nUse an existing virtual hard disk file\n\nUse the file picker to locate the VDI file in your file system and select it.\nBe sure not to create a new virtual hard disk; load the one you are trying to run.\nThe picture below illustrates my point.\n\n", "Q: GUI will not boot without recovery mode I've run into this problem several times before.

However, after an update it will sometimes just boot to the terminal instead of the GUI.  I can log in and do everything, but I'm not sure how to start the GUI at this point.  Running startx does nothing.\nI can get around this by using grub and booting from recovery mode.  I don't actually have to do anything while I'm in recovery mode, I just have to start recovery mode and then immediately select resume (normal boot) and the GUI will load.\nIs there anything I can do to diagnose this problem or make sure that the GUI always starts on a normal boot?\n\nA: Can you give us some more information like:\n\n\n*\n\n*Your graphics card\n\n*The exact response to startx (f.e. black screen, output)\n\n\nIf you expierience a black screen after startx reconfiguring lightdm (for ubuntu) or kdm (for kubuntu) could help:\nsudo dpkg-reconfigure lightdm \n\n\nA: I'm not sure what's causing the problem; however, you can edit your /boot/refind_linux.conf file to include an entry that launches into recovery mode in the same way that GRUB does. You'll need to extract the GRUB options from your GRUB configuration file (probably /boot/grub/grub.cfg) and copy them over to a new entry you create in /boot/refind_linux.conf. That will at least streamline the recovery process, since you'll be able to do it with one fewer menu, without involving GRUB.\n", "Q: Recommended size in percentage for each partition I have seen most of dedicated hosting companies servers always have multiple partition for various folders.

However, data recovery is serious business, so please do read the documentation and take your time before you begin.

See https://superuser.com/a/669168/172006\n\nA: In short, as @ejboy mentioned, resolution issues with DVI cable are caused by poor quality cables which either are not properly shielded from interference, or they don't have enough interconnections to be certified as Dual Link, which is what you need.\nI had the same issue. The problem was that the DVI cable was a cheap and it didn't have the internal connections, so it could only do single link. It looked it was good quality, it was very short (1.5 meters) and had Dual Link connectors but it was a cheap knock off and some pins were not connected. I tried another cable, but it also had a poor build quality and the signal was not strong enough so I would just get a black screen instead of the desired resolution. It was like 3 meters long, and it didn't protect the signal at all, it didn't even had ferrite beads.\nThe third cable I tried costs the same as the previous ones, but I bought it from a trusted supplier. It worked perfectly at 2560x1440@60Hz. It's properly shielded, it's short (1.5m), has all the pins interconnected, and has ferrite beads to reduce electronic noise.\n", "Q: How to access information on SD Cards Ubuntu 12.10 I am running the arm version of Ubuntu 12.10.

Ubuntu (server or desktop edition) itself can be downloaded for free (without costs) and you can use (and modify) it for free (without costs and freedom of speech).

I would like to use m23 to maintain a cluster of other Ubuntu machines, but unfortunately I can't find any documentation how to install m23 server on an Ubuntu machine. Neither are there any packages for Ubuntu.\nDoes anybody know how to install m23 on an Ubuntu machine?\nUPDATE: The Debian source does not work for Ubuntu\nThe following packages have unmet dependencies:\n m23 : Depends: apache-common ist aber nicht but is not going to be installed\n                      apache2.2-common ist but is not going to be installed\n\nThat is strange, because of the fact that apache is installed. What ever, trying to install the package leads to an error:\nPackage 'apache-common' has no installation candidate\n\nI think, the problem is, that the packages in Ubuntu have a different name. Is that possible?\n\nA: m23 is not intended for use on Ubuntu as m23 server. There are too many dependencies on Debian system things for it to run on a derivate of Debian, which differs in crucial parts from Debian (like Ubuntu).\nYou would have to re-write m23 in some parts to make it run on a Ubuntu machine.\nFor this reason, the m23 packages won't install on Ubuntu. m23 even checks if the machine you plan to install it on is a Debian machine, and it won't start if it is on Ubuntu.\nYou can, however, install m23 in a VM on your Ubuntu machine. Or you can set up a Debian server for m23. You could even install m23 on a Raspberry Pi, or in a CloudStack environment. But always on Debian.\nAnd of course, you can manage Ubuntu machines using your m23 server.\nIf you have questions, you can also always ask in the m23 forum - I guess questions about m23 might be answered faster and more complete there by the people who write m23 (like me, I found your question by accident).\n\nA: I found this on the m23 website for installing it in Debian.\n\nThe packages are stored on the SourceForge server and can be installed\n  via APT. The following steps must be done as root:\nImport the GPG key with\nwget -T1 -t1 -q http://m23.sourceforge.net/m23-Sign-Key.asc -O - | apt-key add -\n\nto ensure the integrity of the m23 packages.\nAdd\ndeb http://kent.dl.sourceforge.net/project/m23/m23inst ./\n\nin the /etc/apt/sources.list file.\nRun\n      apt-get update\nAnd install m23 with\napt-get install m23\n\nLet all software get configured automatically (\"yes\"), beside you are\n  really knowing what you are doing.\nMake sure that the network interface (eth0, eth1, ...), that will be\n  used for communication between your m23 server and the m23 clients, is\n  the first in the list of the interfaces shown in\n  /etc/network/interfaces and has a static IP address. This is required\n  to ensure correct communication.\n\n", "Q: How to delete files and subdirectories by size and age? I have a ubuntu server 12.10 which receives images from a camera by FTP, I receive the images in a directory with a fixed quote on the server and I need to delete the oldest images first, I would like to keep 1Gb free for new images.\nI have followed this thread but cannot find the solution there.\nautotrash would be a good command but I do not have gnome installed.\nDoes anybody have any suggestions?\n\nA: Your original question is \"How to delete files and subdirectories by size and age\". Use find:\nThis will delete all files under the current directory larger than 2 MB:\nfind ./ -size +2M -delete\n\nThis will delete all files created more than 7 days ago:\nfind ./ -ctime +7 -delete\n\n", "Q: Root user and Super User How is being the root user different from being the super user? If it is different anyways, is there a way to use the shell as the root? Is there a root password for that? Is it different from the super user password?\n\nA: \nHow is being the root user different from being the super user?\n\nIt's the same, see comment by edwin. Note, however, that the Ubuntu (and generic Unix) superuser is determined by its numeric id, rather than the username. The superuser is the one with a UID of \"0\". Conceivably you could have a user named \"noob\" with an UID of 0, this would constitute a superuser but wouldn't namely be root. This is however very convoluted, for all practical purposes they are the same thing.\n\nIf it is different anyways, is there a way to use the shell as the\n  root?\n\nYou can start a session as root, using the -i option to sudo (for opening an *i*nteractive session):\nsudo -i\n\nYou will be asked for your user's password, to confirm your identity (same as when you run sudo elsewhere). Then you'll be left in a root (or superuser) shell.\n\nIs there a root password for that?\n\nBy default the root user has no password assigned in Ubuntu, you can assign one if you like but it's better to use a normal user and sudo -i if needed. It's even better to just use sudo for specific commands, rather than use a session.\n\nIs it different from the super user password?\n\nOnly if you have another user with id 0.\n\nA: root is the superuser on Linux system. root is the first user created during the process of installing any Linux distro like Ubuntu for example. Most administration tasks, such as adding users or managing file systems require that you first log in as root (UID=0) .\nThe root account, also known as the superuser account, is used to make system changes and can override user file protection.  root has unlimited powers, and can do anything on system hence the term superuser is used.\n", "Q: What's the purpose of /etc/pm/config.d and power.d? What is the purpose of /etc/pm/config.d and /etc/pm/power.d? It's my understand that scripts in /etc/pm/sleep.d are run at the time of a power management event such as the computer sleeping, hibernating, resuming and thawing. \nWhat would I use the config.d and power.d directories for?\n\nA:   /etc/pm/config.d\n       The files in this directory are evaluated in C sort order. These\n       files can be provided by individual packages outside of pm-utils.\n       If a global configuration variable is set, the value set to will be\n       appended to the previous value. If any other variable is set, it\n       will be ignored. The syntax is simply: VAR_NAME = value. See the\n       CONFIGURATION VARIABLES section for valid variables defined by\n       pm-utils. External packages can define others, see their respective\n       documentation for more information.\n\nThe hooks for the power state are placed in\n/usr/lib/pm-utils/power.d\ndistribution / package provided hooks \n\n/etc/pm/power.d\nhooks added by the system administrator \n\nHooks in /etc/pm/ take precedence over those in /usr/lib/pm-utils/, so the system administrator can override the defaults provided by the distribution. \n\nFor instance check this link\n", "Q: Disk naming convention in preseed vs manual installation When I try to install Ubuntu 12.04 onto a Dell PowerEdge R710 via preseed, the auto install first disk is always coming up as /dev/sdc. As per the docs it should be /dev/sda.\nI looked at /var/lib/partman/devices, its does show /dev/sdc.\nOn the same server if I try to install Ubuntu 12.04 manually then the first disk showing as /dev/sda.\nAny idea why preseed auto install and manual install have different disk naming conventions?\n\nA: Check your Virtual Media settings in iDRAC6. I had Virtual Media attached with Floppy Emulation checked on one of my R710's that kept displacing the SCSI disk ID's from sda to sdc. Detaching and unchecking fixed it and I was able to preseed without issue (with sda specified in partman). \nYou will also see in the system BIOS an extra Virtual Floppy and Virtual CD selection in Boot Options. I didn't check to see if you can disable the Virtual Media here.\nHere's how to check via racadm:\n/opt/dell/srvadmin/sbin/racadm -r DRACIP -u root -p XXX getconfig -gcfgRacVirtual\nSecurity Alert: Certificate is invalid - self signed certificate\nContinuing execution.

The drive is only visible through gparted. When I reformat the drive while on Linux, partitions work no matter what - fat, ntfs, ext it all mounts fine.\nHowever, after one reboot it's impossible to mount it. This happens on all my Linux installs, while the drive works on all Windows installations I tried it with.\nI'm using 64-bit Ubuntu 13.10.\nEDIT: Unmounting/unpowering before unplugging the device is what I was doing, and the drive still always appears the same after a reboot - in the \"Disks\" application, without any partitions (although gparted sees them).\n\nA: This is a well known defect with WD Elements drives.  They ship them with a corrupt format since it claims the disk is slightly larger than it actually appears to be.  You will need to repartition the drive to correct WD's error, and you should complain loudly to WD so maybe they will stop shipping broken drives.\n", "Q: Alternatives on Ubuntu This is not question about how Linux works or something similar. I just want ask if is there some similar application like Xilisoft Video Converter and Sony Vegas Pro 10. Because I need an application, where I can edit a video, add subtitles, convert and more. And something like Vegas Pro for editing videos (like cutting, color edits, add music and other). Thanks.\nEdit: + software like notepad++\n\nA: Avidemux is a free video editor designed for simple cutting, filtering and encoding tasks. It supports many file types, including AVI, DVD compatible MPEG files, MP4 and ASF, using a variety of codecs.Avidemux\nTo install you can also click Avidemux .\nVideo Editing program OpenShot Features include: Support for many video, audio, and image formats (based on FFmpeg), Gnome integration (drag and drop support), and Multiple tracks.OpenShot\nTo install you can also click OpenShot .\nLightworks is an editing powerhouse, delivering unparalleled speed and flexibility, fully integrated with the other members of the Complete Collaboration family.Lightworks \nAs far as Notepad++, you can use sCiTE.  SciTE is available in apt repository of Ubuntu. To install it just press Ctrl+Alt+T on your keyboard to open Terminal. When it opens, run the command(s) below:\nsudo apt-get install scite\n\nTo convert Video, take a look at:\nHandBrake is an open-source, multithreaded video transcoder- it converts digital media from one format to another, compressing the files in the process.HandBrake\n\nA: Alternative 1 to Xilisoft Video Converter: I always do my conversion on the command line with ffmpeg as it's fast and effective. There is a bit of a learning curve, however there are numerous front ends available for ease of use several of which are mentioned here: https://github.com/amiaopensource/ffmpeg-amia-wiki/wiki/3)-Graphical-User-Interface-Applications-using-FFmpeg\nAlternative 2 Another powerful video editor that is an alternative to Sony Vegas Pro  (open source) is cinelerra.\nAlternative 3 There are several good alternatives for programming editors like notepad++. Ive used both gedit and scite (both of which are available via the software center) and found them both to be quite satisfactory.\nNote: To install SciTE you'll need to enable the universe repository first.\n", "Q: vsftpd: 530 Login incorrect I can't get vsfptd working on Ubuntu 12.04. \nmy vsftpd.conf file looks like this, and I try to connect with a local user:\nlisten=YES\nanonymous_enable=NO\nlocal_enable=YES\nwrite_enable=YES\ndirmessage_enable=YES\nuse_localtime=YES\nxferlog_enable=YES\nconnect_from_port_20=YES\nsecure_chroot_dir=/var/run/vsftpd/empty\npam_service_name=vsftpd\nrsa_cert_file=/etc/ssl/private/vsftpd.pem\n\nError message in FileZilla:\nResponse:   331 Please specify the password.\nCommand:    PASS ****\nResponse:   530 Login incorrect.\n\n\nA: I did not need to change the vsftpd.conf. Only needed to make sure that a shell was set in my /etc/passwd file, that also was lited in /etc/shells.\nSo basically after useradd without a shell I needed to make sure the home directory was created and that the user had /bin/bash as it's shell.\n\nA: I met this problem when I tried to login in with root and I just solved it.\nvsftpd: version 3.0.2\n\nSolution:\nCheck the following file (it contains list of users disallowed FTP access):\n/etc/ftpusers \n\n\nIn my case, I commented out root from the file, then it worked.\n\nA: Please make some changes in /etc/vsftpd.conf:\npam_service_name=ftp\n\nIf you want to set access by default /var/www directory for local user you can do that with below line:\nlocal_root=/var/www\n\nNow save and exit.\nRestart vsftpd server using:\nsudo service vsftpd restart\n\n\nA: The suggested resolution did not work for me.

This will improve the integrity of the logs. \n\n*You might want to install the Snort IPS/IDS solution just to see if another attack is launched.\n\n*Install a file integrity monitoring solution such as AIDE and monitor config files for changes. \n\n\nhttps://benchmarks.cisecurity.org/downloads/multiform/\n", "Q: Wireless internet problems with Macbook Pro 11,1 I have xubuntu 13.10 installed on a late 2013 macbook pro.

Running ping, I'm showing significant packet loss, up to 100%, and also sometimes showing \"errors\" in the ping statistics.\nI've seen this same behavior on two different wireless networks.  The wireless works fine when running OSX.\nSuggestions?\n\nA: Turns out this has to do with power management.  I came across this note in the ArchWiki:\nhttps://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/broadcom_wireless#Miscellaneous_user_notes\n\nIf you notice slow wireless speeds when your laptop/netbook is not\n  connected to AC power, you may need to disable Wi-Fi power management\n  by adding the following line (assuming wlan0 is your wireless device)\n  iwconfig wlan0 power off to /etc/rc.local and create an empty file\n  /etc/pm/power.d/wireless. In case you also experience interface\n  swapping (discussed above), you might want to add another line for the\n  second interface name as well. The command will have no effect on the\n  wired interface.\n  --Tom.yan, 16 August 2011 \n\nAnd I did notice the wireless problems only came when I was running on battery.  I ran:\nsudo iwconfig eth0 power off\n\nand my problems stopped instantly.\n", "Q: A strange account appear at login to Ubuntu 12.04? An account name student account appear at login , what is thes account and how to disable it .\nHint i disable guest at /etc/lightdm/lightdm.conf\nHow to disable this account ?\n\nA: There's a bug in the last Ubuntu where service accounts that are disabled for login, show up in the login screen. For instance, in mine the user Postgres appears since I installed postgresql service (database system).\nCheck if the user really exist by listing the home directory:\nls /home/\n\nIf there's not something like /home/student maybe the user is one of those service accounts. You can check them with users-admin:\nsudo apt-get install users-admin\nusers-admin\n\nMay I add, in my case, this phantom user also shows up under the users menu on the top left of the Unity panel.\n", "Q: Switching to Java 7 I have both java-6-openjdk and java-7-openjdk installed on my machine. When I check the version, I get java version \"1.6.0_27\". I want to run java 7 but don't really know what all I have to change to accomplish the change.\nIs it as simple as changing the link from /etc/alternatives/java -> /usr/lib/jvm/java-6-openjdk-amd64/jre/bin/java /etc/alternatives/java -> /usr/lib/jvm/java-7-openjdk-amd64/jre/bin/java?\n\nA: You can use sudo update-alternatives --config java to change the version of Java that is used. Don't manually change the linking of anything in /etc/alternatives/java. This is described well in Changing JVM in Java.\nAlternatively, if you don't plan on using Java 6 in the future, you can remove Java 6 in its entirety.

In bash you can send commands to the \"background\" so that they don't block the command line. For example, try running gedit on the terminal. Gedit's window should appear and the command line should be \"blocked\", that is, you cannot type any new command unless you close Gedit.\nA solution to this blocking behavior of \"long running\" processes is to send their commands to the background on invocation. This way the command won't block and you will be able to continue working on the command line.\nA way to send a command to the background is by using the & after the command. Continuing with the Gedit example, you can start it on the background by running\ngedit &\n\nYou will now notice that the command prompt is printed immediately and you can run new commands (contrast this with simply running gedit without ampersand). You'll also notice the extra information about the new \"job\" you just created: the job number in brackets, and its PID.\nWhen the job ends (either normally or because you killed it), bash will notify you with something similar to:\n[1]+  Done                    gedit &\n\n(The 1 is the job number and on the right you have the command with which you created this job, just in case you forgot :-)\nIf you have several jobs on the background you can use the command jobs to get a list with their statuses.\nIn conclusion, you don't need to add the ampersand unless you want to run another command immediately.\nFor references and other interesting aspects about job control read:\n\n\n*\n\n*Job Control, wooledge\n\n*Job Control, MIT\n", "Q: how to custumize ubuntu 12.04 after installing NVIDA driver?

So it will not use USB 3.0 during the boot. \nNote: Also make sure that Legacy USB support it set to Auto or Enabled.\n\nA: I suggest please check your bios setting and make sure the USB legacy is On/Enabled or Auto mode.

It would simply end up on a black screen and make the drum noise and the cursor keys would actually generate other noises - so it seems as if it is a graphics card issue.  However, after adding the nomodeset flag/setting at the end of the linux line Ubuntu finally loaded off the USB drive - but only version 13 (13.10) - I couldn't get 12 (12.04.3) to work.\nMy graphics card is: \"NVIDIA GeForce GTX 780 - 3 GB - 941 GHZ\".\nNow for my question - since I was able to work-around this issue using the nomodeset when booting off the USB drive - it does imply/confirm the problem is Ubuntu's \"understanding\" of my video-card.  I'm still unable to load Ubuntu off my harddrive, even if I append the nomodeset flag/setting in the /etc/default/grub file onto this line:\nGRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT=\"quiet splash\"\nthus changing it to:\nGRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT=\"quiet splash nomodeset\"\nI've tried running boot-repair three times now.  When I boot using the Ubuntu ISO on my USB drive - there are three video drivers listed (under \"additional drivers\" in \"software and updates\"):\n\n\n*\n\n*NVidia 319 (proprietary)\n\n*Nvidia 319 (proprietary, tested)\n\n*x.org x server - nouveau display driver from xserver-xorg-video-nouveau\n\n\nAnd even if I change the above selection (in the UI) to one of the NVidia drivers - when I  reboot it returns to the Ubuntu's Nouveau video driver I've read some articles about bumblebee or nvidia-prime.  Apparently they're different routes you can go to try to address this - but it requires a series of commands of purge, followed by install, followed by update and I don't want to mess things up worse than they already are - so I wanted to make sure I selected the right drivers/versions and most importantly used the correct commands for my version of the graphics card.\nOne thing I'm not clear on is when I boot from USB drive and load into the \"live session\" (I believe that is what it is called) - are the updates I make getting applied to my computer's harddrive or just to the USB drive?  The reason I ask is because after issuing a bunch of commands/code like the ones below - a bunch of updates seem to happen and if I load the \"Additional Drivers\" panel in \"Software and Updates\" I see a new entry nvidia-331 (open source) has replaced the entry that was once nvidia-319 (proprietary and tested).  But then when I restart it is gone again.\nI've tried the following commands:\nsudo apt-get remove --purge nvidia-319-updates\nsudo apt-get remove --purge nvidia-settings-319-updates\nIt always just says \"not found\".\nThen the following:\n\nsudo apt-add-repository ppa:xorg-edgers/ppa\nsudo apt-get update\n#sudo apt-get install nvidia-331\n#But instead of the above command - I used\nsudo apt-get install nvidia-current\n\n#I've also tried this\nsudo apt-get install noveau-firmware xserver-xorg-video-nouveau xsever-xorg-video-nouveau-dbg\n\nBut I just get \n\"unable to locate package nouveau-firmware\"\nI also tried the instructions mentioned in the comments (the BinaryDriverHowto/Nvidia):\n\njockey-text --help\njockey-text -l\njockey-text -e xorg:nvidia_current\n\nI saw my two disabled nvidia drivers 319 (proprietary and \"proprietary and tested\") when I used the \"jockey-text -l\" command.  However, when I tried to use the \"jockey-text -e xorg:nvidia_current\" - it just told me it wasn't found.  So off to google I went and found this page:\nhttp://falkvinge.net/2013/02/15/how-to-install-nvidia-drivers-in-ubuntu-12-10-quantal/\nAnd I did everything except \n\napt-get install linux-headers-generic\napt-get dist-upgrade\n\nBecause the idea of building the headers and having that \"up to date\" version of things scared me.  But when I used this command\n\napt-get install nvidia-current-updates\n\nit did end up getting the nvidia_304 driver.  And then when I executed this command:\n\nnvidia-xconfig\n\nI got something interesting back:\n\"warning: unable to locate/open x configuration file.\"\nand\n\"new x configuration file written to '/etc/X11/xorg.conf'\"\nI don't know if that is a good thing or not - but it sounds like it has now created I file I had needed.  And now when I use the \"jockey-text -l\" command I see a new driver (nvidia_304) and it is \"enabled\" - but \"not in use\" (possibly because I'm in the \"drop to root terminal\").\nOn reboot - I get\n\n[1.457572][drm:drm_pci_agp_init] *ERROR* Cannot initialize the  agpart module.\n[1.457642]DRM: Fill_in_dev failed.\n\nAnd even if I try going to \"recovery mode\" it stops/fails here:\n[1.420000] microcode: Microcode Update Driver: v2.00 , Peter Oruba\nand nothing more is printed to screen - so looks like I've bricked it.  I can't even access the install of Ubuntu on my harddrive.  Back to the drawing board.  Thankfully on my PC there is a Ubuntu using Linux 3.11.0-15-generic and Linux 3.11.0-12-generic.  Without being able to get into the 3.11.0-12-generic I wouldn't have been able to go into the \"reovery mode\" menu and \"update grub bootloader\" and get the windows partition to appear in the grub menu (every time I run boot-repair it removes that entry).  I've apparently installed tainted NVidia drivers (according to some error messages when I try to boot into the 3.11.00-15 version) - so that OS can no longer boot - I can't even enter the recovery mode menu to \"drop to root\" (the terminal window).  How hard is it to just reinstall Ubuntu over an existing install using the USB drive?  The boot-repair didn't fix anything.\nI'm still just taking wild shots in the dark and I'm now 48 hours without a working install of Ubuntu on my harddrive.\nThanks!\n\nA: In some cases if a brand new install, it can be quicker just to reinstall.\nonly reason to purge is there are several versions, if you know you have different nVidia use that:\nTo see available versions:\ndpkg -l | grep -i nvidia*\n\nsee details for version installed, change from example with 319 to yours.\nsudo apt-cache policy nvidia*\nsudo apt-cache policy nvidia-319-updates \n\nsudo apt-cache search nvidia-sett*\n\nHouseclean out all old versions to avoid issues\nsudo apt-get remove --purge < nvidiadriverpackagename>\n\n[ using the correct names] for each driver, before running:\nsudo apt-get purge nvidia*\nsudo mv /etc/X11/xorg.conf /etc/X11/xorg.conf.backup\n\nthen you need to reinstall nvidia from repository. Usually you can boot into low resolution gui with nomodeset. Or if at command line.\nInstall version you prefer\nI used nvidia-current-updates & nvidia-settings-updates, example below is just nvidia-current, I usually install from gui & system settings, but have used command line.\nsudo apt-get install nvidia-current\nsudo apt-get install nvidia-settings\nsudo dpkg-reconfigure nvidia-current\nsudo nvidia-xconfig\nsudo reboot\n\nMay want nvidia-current, nvidia-current-updates or nvidia-current-experimental-XXX for most recent testing version. Available list is in first command above.\n", "Q: Colorscheme vim depending on Project I have a project that uses Ruby & Javascript and I am really comfortable with a particular colorscheme.\nHowever I have another project in PHP + HTML, and I would like to use another colorscheme. What should I do?\nI have my vim configuration in ~/.vimrc\nThanks\n\nA: You can make use of the ftplugin feature. First create the relevant directory:\nmkdir -p ~/.vim/ftplugin\n\nAnd second, add the line\nfiletype plugin on\n\nto your .vimrc.\n\nNow you can add language specific options to a file called <language-name>.vim located in the directory ~/.vim/ftplugin:\ncat <<EOF > ~/.vim/ftplugin/ruby.vim\ncolorscheme myRubyTheme\nset expandtab\nset shiftwidth=2\nset softtabstop=2\nEOF\n\n(This creates the file ~/.vim/ftplugin/ruby.vim and adds to it the contents presented.)\nTo determine the name of the language (as Vim understands it), open a file with the necessary file type (say MyLibrary.js) and type :set ft. For a JavaScript file Vim should return filetype=javascript, so the ftplugin for JavaScript should be named javascript.vim. \nFor a more thorough exposition read Keep your vimrc file clean on Vim's wiki page.\n", "Q: How to purge BAM huawei mobile partner?

Selecting Windows 7 loads either /dev/sda1 or /dev/sda2 gives immediately a disk read error. \nI can access my Windows files from my Ubuntu installation, but cannot access the Windows OS. \nI have run a SMART check several times, all coming up clean. \nI have been told that the boot loader may have been overwritten, but cannot confirm this. \nAny and all help would be incredibly appreciated. As I am a relative novice to Linux, I may not be able to provide in-depth details, nor understand the more technical answers.\n\nA: There are two options here as I see it.\n\n\n*\n\n*You can try to repair the machine to where it was before. If you can find a Windows installation disk, this could be very easy, but it will make Ubuntu unbootable. Given you have data in windows and no data in Ubuntu, this is acceptable. At some later date, armed with more information you can try to reinstall Ubuntu.\n\n*You can try to repair the machine so that dual boot works correctly. This is harder, especially for a novice, and the outcome is less predictable. Nevertheless it may be worth trying, especially if experts reply to your question and are willing to help -- you can also try posting on the Ubuntu's own forums, where you may be more likely to get a response.\noption 1\nIf you have, or can borrow, a windows 7 installation disk for your Windows 7 flavour (32 or 64 bit), this should give you the \"repair\" option to restore the Windows master boot record (MBR). See, e.g., http://www.tomshardware.com/news/win7-windows-7-mbr,10036.html. The \"repair\" option worked for me when I was unable to boot Windows 7 after installing ubuntu 12.04 a year or so ago on a new laptop, but the article I linked to goes into other things you can try if repair doesn't work.\noption 2\nYour problem may be related to issues installing on newer computers which have UEFI mode booting. Normally to boot from a CD you have to change your bios, but with UEFI systems there are two options and you need to choose the right one (see this answer). A good web page discussing how to deal with the resulting problems is https://help.ubuntu.com/community/UEFI. In particular you could try the boot repair tool. There is also a link here to posting on ubuntu's own forums, which I would encourage you to try if you decide to take option 2 (or indeed if you take option 1 and then decide to try installing ubuntu again).\ncomment\nPersonally I would tend to favour taking option 1, if you can, or if you are desparate to get your Windows system back. One reason for this is that it may be a lot easier to reinstall ubuntu once you have restored windows (with appropriate advice from here or from ubuntu's own forums). My experience was that the boot repair tool didn't work, and I've seen some comments to the effect that trying to repair an ubuntu system where you installed it wrongly in the first place can be risky.\n(A further option you could consider if you repaired using option 1 is to install ubuntu on a virtual machine within Windows. Search the web for this. Using a virtual machine of course may not go perfectly but it's safe as houses, because it's a windows program/data that you can simply delete if it goes wrong. If it does go well it may be what you need.) \n", "Q: Problem booting into Windows 8.1 after using Ubuntu live cd 12.04 I have a Lenovo laptop tha came with Windows 8 64bit pre-installed.\nI recently decided to pop in an Ubuntu Live CD 12.04 and I was messing around with it and I decided to try to erase the Windows password using the command that I found in  this website. \nThe first time I tried this command, I was able to restart and boot into my Windows 8 and the second time as well (I kept doing this command because it didn't seem to work so I thought a 3rd will be a charm and well...) and the third time I did it I don't know what I did wrong, it seemed like I did everything the same, but the next time I tried to boot up it just said \"checking media\" and it keeps restarting. \nSo when I boot into the Ubuntu live CD, I can see my Windows 8 hard drive and the Windows recovery partition when I click the home folder. \nI would just reinstall my Windows 8, but I need the product key which I never wrote down and it's not under the laptop.\n\nA: The same website offers a solution on how to recover Windows product key (and other Microsoft software) using a Linux live CD/USB. You need to have a separate storage to copy the \n\nC:\\Windows\\system32\\config\n\ndirectory to run the recovery software.\nOnce you have the product key, write it down and keep it somewhere safe.\n", "Q: How to execute several commands after each other with one request to the terminal (without using a file)? I could (1) prepare a file with typed commands separated by end-line, (2) make it executable, (3) run it from a file-system manager or the terminal.\nBut this is ridiculous for not repeatable and every-time-other sets of commands.\nCan I type those commands to the terminal in one request instead?\nI don't know end-line character for the terminal - Ctrl, Shift or Alt with Enter doesn't work.  \n\nA: If you are interested to type each command on its own line in one single request you can use the following method:\n\n\n*\n\n*Start your request (first line) with if :; then (this mean: if true, then do) and press Enter; your prompt will change now in > and nothing will be executed.\n\n*Type your commands, each one followed by Enter\n\n*Finish your request with with fi (end of the above if condition) and press Enter. Now all your commands will be executed in the given order.\nExample:\nradu@Radu: ~ $ if :; then\n> echo 'something'\n> echo 'something else'\n> echo 'List current directory contents:'\n> ls\n> echo 'Change current directory with root directory:'\n> cd\n> #finish\n> fi\nsomething\nsomething else\nList current directory contents:\nBackups            Desktop           forma3d  Public      Untitled txt.txt~\nbin                Documente         Music    Templates   Videos\nconfiguration.php  examples.desktop  passwd~  tmp~\nDownloads          file~             Poze     Ubuntu One\nChange current directory with root directory:\nradu@Radu: / $\n\nA: First, put a { on its own line.\nThen, insert your commands.\nThen, put a } on a new line and press Enter. Your commands will be executed.\nExample:\n{\necho list\necho of\necho commands\necho to run at once\n}\n\nwhich will print (all at once, with no prompt in between):\nlist\nof\ncommands\nto run at once\n\nAs a side note, { .. } is the Bash command grouping syntax. It's  often useful in conjunction with && or || ('and', and 'or' respectively) \n\nA: You can separate commands with && or ;. \n\n\n*\n\n*&& only runs the next command if the previous one exited with status 0 (was successful) :\ncommand1 && command2 && command3\n\n\n*; runs every commands, even if the previous one exits with a non zero status :\ncommand1; command2; command3\n\nYou can combine these separators as you wish. \n", "Q: Gedit 3.6.3 in Ubuntu 12.04?

Please tell me if that works, Thanks in advanced!\nEDIT\nThe info I posted above does not work.\nEDIT\nIt looks like people want to know why, well the reason is because I want the latest features and speed improvements that came in GNOME 3.6 and all of GNOME's applications. + I already have some GNOME 3.6.3 software (As you can tell from the link above I've installed Nautilus 3.6.3 aka Files 3.6.3).\nEDIT\nUmm, so I am missing some of the dependencies that Gedit needs, do I download it from packages.ubuntu.com and then install it the same way I attempted to install Gedit 3.6.2?\n\nA: Gedit 3.6.3 does not exist.

I had 12.04LTS and recently decided to upgrade to 13.10. 12.10 wouldn't ever start up and all I could access was the GRUB and the terminal, so I upgraded to 13.10 from there. I have a cd with 12.04 on it but I do not have the others on a disk and I cannot make one because I do not have a cd large enough to make one. After 13.10 was installed, it worked alright. There were black bars around every field and I could not acess the terminal at all. I restarted it and after I put in my password, the screen goes blank and after a moment or so there would be two boxes that say something along the lines of a system problem being detected and I could move the cursor to click either cancel or report the problem. Nothing would happen after that, but by using ctrl + alt + t I could access the terminal. I looked at a few other topics that others seemed to be having the same problem as I did but all of the solutions that were being suggested didn't work for some reason. I don't want to reinstall the system because I couldn't create a backup of my files before this happened.\n\nA: The same problem I have faced.

I want to do a simple experiment with it. Like from my computer, if I play an audio file, I should be able to hear it on a speaker which is connected via ethernet. \nIs this possible? Please give me your inputs about it.\n\nA: Pulse audio runs as a server and a client . In order to configure pulse audio, you first need to install some additional programs: \nsudo apt-get install \"pulseaudio-*\" paman padevchooser paprefs\n\nOnce installed, you need to launch the app on all your computers. It can be found as “Pulse Audio Preferences” in the Unity Dash or launched from the Terminal by running ‘paprefs‘.\n\nOn the computer connected to your speakers, use the “Network Server” tab, and check both “Enable network access to local sound devices” and “Allow other machines on the LAN to discover local sound devices“. I found I also had to enable “Don’t require authentication“, however, obviously this is not recommended for a public network.\nOn the computers you want to connect with check the “Make discoverable PulseAudio network devices available locally” option.\nYou should now be able see the shared output devices in the default Sound Preferences application.\nIf you don’t see the devices straight away, sometimes un-checking and re-checking “Make discoverable PulseAudio network devices available locally” will cause them to be discovered.\nsource1\nsource2\nAlso you can use VLC to do the job.

I have a Dell Inspiron laptop with 300GB hard drive, in which I use 200GB for Windows 7 and 100GB for Ubuntu 12.04. \nIs there any way I could operate my Windows 7 in Ubuntu, because there are some applications which run in Windows and every time I need to shut down Ubuntu and restart using Windows, making it a tedious job?\n\nA: Sure you can't do that since every OS has different kernel to be loaded and other things related to its core image to run correctly.\nBut you can install windows applications using wine inside ubuntu.\n\nA: What your are asking is called a Hypervisor. Xen Hypervisor is one of those. \n\nWhat is Xen?\nXen is an open-source type-1 or baremetal hypervisor, which makes it possible to run many instances of an operating system or indeed different operating systems in parallel on a single machine (or host). Xen is the only type-1 hypervisor that is available as open source. Xen is used as the basis for a number of different commercial and open source applications, such as: server virtualization, Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS), desktop virtualization, security applications, embedded and hardware appliances. Xen is powering the largest clouds in production today. \nComponents in detail:\n  \n  \n*\n  \n*The Xen Hypervisor is an exceptionally lean (<150,000 lines of code) software layer that runs directly on the hardware and is responsible for managing CPU, memory, and interrupts. It is the first program running after the bootloader exits. The hypervisor itself has no knowledge of I/O functions such as networking and storage. \n  \n\n(more details when you click the link)\nImage of the setup (source of the image). The source has a very nice comparison between VMWare, MS Viridian and Xen.\n\nThe Ubuntu official documentation has installation method and tips and tricks on how to set this up:\n\nDuring installation of Ubuntu\nDuring the install of Ubuntu for the Partitioning method choose\n  \"Guided - use the entire disk and setup LVM\". Then, when prompted to\n  enter \"Amount of volume group to use for guided partitioning:\" Enter a\n  value just large enough for the Xen Dom0 system, leaving the rest for\n  virtual disks. Enter a value smaller than the size of your\n  installation drive. For example 10 GB or even 5 GB should be large\n  enough for a minimal Xen Dom0 system. Entering a percentage of maximum\n  size (e.g. 25%) is also a reasonable choice.\nInstalling Xen\nInstall a 64-bit hypervisor. (A 64-bit hypervisor works with a 32-bit\n  dom0 kernel, but allows you to run 64-bit guests as well.)\nsudo apt-get install xen-hypervisor-amd64\n\nModify GRUB to default to booting Xen (\"Xen 4.1-amd64\" should be\n  replaced with the appropriate name, in 12.10 the line is \"Ubuntu\n  GNU/Linux, with Xen hypervisor\"):\nsudo sed -i 's/GRUB_DEFAULT=.*\\+/GRUB_DEFAULT=\"Xen 4.1-amd64\"/'\n/etc/default/grub sudo update-grub\n\nSet the default toolstack to xm (aka xend):\nsudo sed -i 's/TOOLSTACK=.*\\+/TOOLSTACK=\"xm\"/' /etc/default/xen\n\nNow reboot:\nsudo reboot\n\nAnd then verify that the installation has succeeded:\nsudo xm list \nName      ID   Mem VCPUs     State    Time(s) \nDomain-0  0   945     1     r-----      11.3\n\n\n", "Q: I can't install latest Wine (1.7.8) Please help me to install WIne 1.7.8 on Ubuntu 12.04.\nI added ppa, updated but it installing for me 1.7.11 instead 1.7.8...\n\nA: To Install Winehq 1.7.8 via PPA in Ubuntu 12.04\nopen Terminal ( Ctrl+Alt+T) and copy the following commands in the Terminal:\nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:ubuntu-wine/ppa\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get install wine1.7 winetricks\n\n\nA: To install older versions, you have to download it from another source.

In the more recent...years(?) unetbootin has been causing issues with newer UEFI systems. \nIf you didn't partition your main drive, you definitely want to remove the USB, boot into Windows, and create either a recovery USB for your bootloader or a backup of your system before dual booting. Windows has the tools for both in the control panel. \nTo install Ubuntu, enter BIOS and change boot mode from UEFI to legacy so that your computer is able to read the USB-HDD option, or reformat the USB drive with Rufus and try again. Another option to check is if is USB virtualization on, to enable booting from USBs.\nJust realized this was bumped from 2014...hope you fixed it!\n", "Q: Permission denied...?

I am thinking to fix this myself instead of telling UNIX PROD guys as I have the root access with me as well and I will be able to learn something new as well.\nMay be, it was not mounted properly?\n\nA: Likely the partition was mounted with the errors=remount-ro option, that means, if an error is encountered on the file system it will be remounted read-only. Then you encountered an I/O error (which is usually a hardware error because of a failing disk). Because of that I/O error the partition got remounted read-only.\nYou can check the current mounts with simply mount. You can try remounting the disk read-write, but since it is a production machine, with a likely hardware error, I would just contact the \"guys\".

Any ideas?\nIf relevant: I'm using Ubuntu 12.04.\n\nA: The way you did it, the command was run prematurely, i.e. before the actual start of the guest-session. Try this instead:\necho 'setxkbmap -layout us' >> $HOME/.profile\n\nI just rewrote the tutorial about customizing guest sessions. It might help you understand it better.\nEdit:\nThis has become more tricky on later Ubuntu versions.

Good alternatives which allow this feature are most welcome, but should allow for audio recording as well.\nP.S.:\n\n\n*\n\n*The original video here: \n\n\n*\n\n*How to use google drive as music player\n\n\n*The screencaster I require should record video and not gif, the gif above is only for explaining what I need and is light-weight for AU.\n\n*I would like to have the screencaster have its own zooming ability and not application-specific zooming ability, i.e. I can zoom into Firefox using Ctrl++. However, this won't work with all applications, I would like the screencaster to have this ability in itself or a generic zooming ability.\n\nA: One way to proceed would be to use Compiz and its Zoom Desktop plugin.\n\nThe Zoom Desktop plugin offers the ability to zoom in for an enlarged view of the screen. [..] Zoom Desktop works by causing the entire screen to zoom in, effectively giving you a more readable view of a portion of the screen.\n\nThus you can use compiz as a WM to zoom into portion of the screen while you're recording the screencast. \nSee also: \n\n\n*\n\n*How to zoom in & zoom out\n\nA: In that video, they used Camtasia studio, the best recorder I have ever used. I spent so much time trying to find recorders that are close to that recorder. Here's a discussion on how to install it on wine.\nAnyway, I did not spend hour just to give that answer :)\nYou can use a web app, which looks great, Screencast Matic, I have java installed this way, I don't have Icedtead plugin, I do not know if it will work on OpenJDK. Just click record my desktop, it will start a Java app and follow your cursor.\nThere's also Simplescreenrecorder, which you can install like so\nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:maarten-baert/simplescreenrecorder\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get install simplescreenrecorder\n# if you want to record 32-bit OpenGL applications on a 64-bit system:\nsudo apt-get install simplescreenrecorder-lib:i386\n\nYou can choose to let the app follow the cursor. That app uses the codecs that you already have on your system, so you have to install the Codecs that you like.\nIn the picture above, Camtasia automatically zoom to where the cursor is, the other recorders do not do that, they follow your cursor, but you have to zoom, if you want to zoom you have to hold Ctrl + + or Ctrl + the middle cursor and they will zoom to where the cursor is. But at least, unlike Camtasia, they are free.\n\n\n*\n\n*RecordItNow has everything that you need, it's a KDE app, the\nreviews on the software center are bad. I have not tried it, but\nhere's a demo\n\n*Here's a Sreencast O Matic demo, I hold the ctrl key +  middle\ncursor, but you can also use ctrl + +\n\n*Here's SimpleScreenRecorder demo (please download the video and\nplay it in VLC, just to make sure that it will work) I zoomed the\nsame way mentioned above.\n\nA: You can achieve that with compizconfig-settings-manager and compiz-plugins-main :\nsudo apt-get install compizconfig-settings-manager compiz-plugins-main\n\nThen, open CCSM (Compiz Config Settings Manager) and enable the Enhanced Zoom Desktop \nYou'll be able to zoom in and out like in this video.

This is my htop output when I watch something on Twitch:\n\nI use Firefox. When I watch something on Youtube, the CPU%-value is at about 10... or 20% (I installed Intel support via a PPA, which I took from a guide on webup8.org) . Besides that, the video at Twitch is stuttering, it is practically unwatchable.\n\n\n*\n\n*Is there a problem in the way I set up this Intel graphics support for Flash?\n\n*Or is there a problem with Twitch's Flash stream?\nEither way, is there a way to improve the performance when watching something on Twitch?\n\nA: So I decided to mark this as an answer because there doesn't seem to be a way for the user to improve things when watching Twitch in a browser.\nAfter further research, I found for myself that it's more feasible to look for other methods to mitigate Twitch's poor performance overall. \nHere is the alternative method which makes it possible to watch a video stream in VLC. \nI found this guide on xmodulo.com, initially via linux.com:\nFIRST THINGS FIRST\n\n\n*\n\n*You can paste into the terminal via Ctrl + Shift + V.

So with Livestreamer, you can enjoy live streaming from various sources via a much stable and lightweight video player such as VLC or mplayer, without opening a web browser. Currently, Livestreamer supports streaming from over 20 different web sites including Dailymotion, YouTube Live, Twitch/Justin.tv, Livestream and UStream.\nInstall Livestreamer on Ubuntu\n$ sudo apt-get install python-pip\n$ sudo pip install livestreamer \n\nBy default, Livestreamer attempts to pipe streaming video into VLC player. Thus you also need to install VLC player on your Linux system:\n$ sudo apt-get install vlc\n\nWatch Live Streaming from the Command Line with Livestreamer\nTo watch any live streaming channel/program, first obtain its corresponding URL from its official site.\nFor example, let's say the URL for the live streaming content that you want to watch is http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vw4KVoEVcr.\nTo check available streaming quality (i.e., bitrate) of the given content, simply run livestreamer command with the URL:\n$ livestreamer http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vw4KVoEVcr0\n\nThe output for that is\n[cli][info] Found matching plugin youtube for URL http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vw4KVoEVcr0\nAvailable streams: 144p (worst), 240p, 360p (best)\n\nTo watch a live stream in the best available quality, run livestreamer command in the following format. This will automatically launch VLC player, and streaming will start on VLC:\n$ livestreamer http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U4Pw3ofFWgs best \n\nTo watch a live stream in specific streaming quality (e.g., 360p), run livestreamer as follows:\n$ livestreamer http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U4Pw3ofFWgs 360p\n\nIf you have your own favorite streaming player, you can let Livestreamer launch the player instead of default VLC, as follows:\n$ livestreamer --player=mplayer http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U4Pw3ofFWgs 360\n\n\nA: Google Chrome has the newest Pepper Flash v 12.xx on board, whereas Firefox is restricted to the os version 11.xx.

I am very new to Linux but keen to learn. I am moderately happy to use command line etc although I will not understand what I am typing (yet). I have previously used Ubuntu but not gone into any command line stuff.\nI will be doing an install of Win 7 then installing Ubuntu.\nMy question: I see that the Ubuntu installer will now auto detect the Win7 installation, and will offer to install alongside. Partitioning is done by dragging a slider between a single win partition and a single Ubuntu partition. \nIs this an OK way to do things, or is it very sub-optimal such that you would recommend manual partitioning (to setup /swap etc manually)?\nThanks :)\n\nA: The default partitioning arrangement is probably not much good. It isn't that much harder to create partitions manually. It's good to know exactly what is going on.\nIt's probably better to use GParted for partitioning. It can be found on the Ubuntu LiveCD (choose the Try Ubuntu option), or on a special GParted LiveCD, or on KNOPPIX, or just about anything else.\nIt is safe to shrink NTFS partitions in GParted, although it is best to run CHKDSK and make some backups before doing so.\nHere is a partitioning scheme that worked for me. You can add a /home partition to it if you want to - I have managed without one.\nSwap needs to be at least as big as your RAM. / (root) can be around 32GB, but definitely more than 16GB.\nBefore installing Ubuntu, reboot into Windows once or twice, possibly run CHKDSK again - this is to ensure that Windows fixes any issues.\nAfter this, install Ubuntu; no need to resize anything in the installer.\n\nA: The other thing you might want to consider is LVM.. LVM pools one or more physical partitions (which it calls \"physical volumes\", or PVs) into a volume group (VG), from which you can then create logical volumes (LVs.) LVs can be composed of spans of \"extents\" from multiple PVs, giving you a lot of flexibility with your disk layout. If I'm sharing a disk with Windows, I tend to divide the free-space into a few PVs and merge them back together into a VG .. this means that if, at a later date, I want to \"hand back\" some of my disk to Windows, it is a possibility (vacate the PV, then remove it and format it as an NTFS partition.)\nIt looks like the desktop installer has (some) support for LVM as of 12.10:\nhttp://www.linuxbsdos.com/2012/11/03/ubuntu-12-10-installation-and-disk-partitioning-guide/\nJust creating one PV and one LV should be enough to \"future proof\" you - any other changes (shrinking your LV, creating new PVs, etc.) could be done afterwards. This page looks like a good intro to LVM:\nhttps://wiki.ubuntu.com/Lvm\n\nA: You need a different partition to  be able to use a different operating system. This has to do with the fact that on any computer, the bootloader needs to assign a different \"location\" (kindof) to each OS. \nSo you need at least two partitions, but I'll go ahead and say you need three actually; one for Windows, one for your root (/, where all your system/program files are) and one for your home (/home, where your own data is, with your preferences for the programs you use as well). More about Linux directory architecture\nI would personally say it's better to do it manually, but you can't make a mistake at this stage: partitioning operations are very sensitive. But we can help.\nA few questions for you: \n\n\n*\n\n*How much space do you have on your hard drive?\n\n*How much RAM do you have on your computer?\n\n*How many partitions are there currently on your Hard drive?\n\n\nA: I'm not an expert but I installed Ubuntu along side Windows 8 after trying a few things.\nI made a live USB running 'gparted' to see exactly what space was on hard drive, you can edit partitions within it.\nI then installed Ubuntu (after testing it out) from live USB Ubuntu stick with the standard partitioning tools. I went through the manual options to see what happened but used most of the default options.\nIf you are not confident, I'd start by installing in a small partition as you can always expand it or format it if it doesn't work. Good luck\n", "Q: DPM in ubuntu 13.10 I've read that  AMD Radeon driver got dynamic power management support with Linux which means that the GPU and memory clocks adjust dynamically based on load which is very useful for saving power.

After finding Ubuntu useful and running into space problems on that small partition, I created a new bigger one next to it and installed Ubuntu (same version) there again. The boot menu was updated correctly after both installations but since I didn't need the smaller Ubuntu partition any more, I deleted it - leading to a boot menu entry pointing to a non-existent installation. After learning about Grub Customizer, I was able to delete (or hide, whatever) the boot menu entry of the old Ubuntu installation and set the new one as default, everything was fine.\nProblem:\nAfter I received an update today (kernel image or something, not sure how to find out what it was exactly), suddenly the old boot menu entries are back at system boot:\n\nAn interesting detail is that since the update, the top two entries show the new kernel version 3.8.0-35-generic, even though the entry for the \"current\" (existent) Ubuntu installation (under which I received the update) is the 6th from the top, i.e. the one on /dev/sdb7, which still shows 3.8.0-29-generic.\nThe Grub Customizer still showed the menu the way I had configured it previously (removed 2 top entries pointing to the old Ubuntu installation as well as the \"Previous Linux versions\" entry):\n\nI already tried running update-grub as found here, but this still seems to find the old (3.8.0-29-generic) version, although I am unsure if they are really reported correctly:\nfriendfx@Laptop:~$ sudo update-grub\n[sudo] password for friendfx: \nGenerating grub.cfg ...\nFound linux image: /boot/vmlinuz-3.8.0-35-generic\nFound initrd image: /boot/initrd.img-3.8.0-35-generic\nFound linux image: /boot/vmlinuz-3.8.0-29-generic\nFound initrd image: /boot/initrd.img-3.8.0-29-generic\nFound memtest86+ image: /boot/memtest86+.bin\nFound Microsoft Windows XP Professional on /dev/sdb2\ndone\n\n...and, more importantly, after rebooting the menu at system boot is still the same, i.e. with the old and \"Previous Linux versions\" entries.\nQuestion:\nWhat can I do to get the configuration I set in Grub Customizer to apply to the actual boot menu at system start?

It has 16GB RAM and a Crucial 240GB SSD.  Was working flawlessly, except for sound, so I started running the Systems tests (System > Administration > System Testing).\nWhen I executed the Suspend test, the system did not automatically unsuspend after 60 seconds.\nIt would not unsuspend by pressing the power button briefly.\nI can turn the NUC off by holding the power button down.\nBut when I press the power button and power it back up, the screen(s) stay blank, with no input.  I don't get to see anything: not the Intel NUC splash screen, nor anything of the Visual BIOS.  Nothing.  Nada.\nBasically, I can't power the machine back on.\nWhat do I do?  This is a horrible, horrible position to be put into.  I never dreamed that Linux would kill my new PC.\nI did some google searching, and tried using the procedure at http://www.intel.com/support/motherboards/desktop/sb/CS-034211.htm under the Settings Were Changed in BIOS section, guessing that perhaps buggy code altered the BIOS.  For a while I thought it was going to work: I was trying for an opportunity to hit F2 during reboot to reset the BIOS to the factory defaults:  I moved the BIOS yellow \"Security\" jumper across to the pins to allow this, and by the time I switched the display over to HDMI input (for the NUC), I was rewarded by seeing a Grub boot screen, but in a weird display mode (very large text, pale grey).  I even started booting up ubuntu, and got to the point where it said /home was missing (I hadn't plugged in the external HDD), when I thought I should really reset the BIOS to factory defaults, first.  So I did Ctrl-Alt-Del to reboot, and got the Intel NUC splash screen again - but nothing else.  F2 didn't take me into BIOS setup, and the splash screen just stayed there.  Since then I haven't managed to get it as far as the Grub boot menu, the best I can manage is to see the Intel NUC splash screen, which just sits there.  Or if I move the jumper positions back to normal, I see nothing, just a blank screen when I power on.\nI'm wondering whether I'm going to have to risk trying to reset the BIOS to a recovery one, as per http://www.intel.com/support/motherboards/desktop/sb/CS-023360.htm; but I don't know what filesystem to use for the USB key.  I suppose FAT would be the safest.\n\nA: I found some Intel documentation (http://www.intel.com/support/motherboards/desktop/sb/CS-034637.htm) that said that the system: \"If you are using an HDMI monitor or HDTV that does not support a resolution of 1024x768, you cannot access the Intel® Visual BIOS Setup when pressing the F2 key.\"  By booting up a 2nd PC and using it to set the DisplayPort connected monitor to 1024x768 mode and unplugging the HDMI cable to the main display, I could get the system to give me a grub boot menu.  After booting Ubuntu, upon the next reboot, the BIOS screen appeared, and in this case it also displayed three options that weren't being displayed during this problem: options to hit F2, F7, or F10.  I managed to reset the BIOS to defaults and the system now boots again. \nI still think that it's pretty shocking that running a system test (in particular, to try to put the system into Suspend mode), could make the system unable to get as far as the BIOS, let alone the boot menu.  A warning of this extreme-failure possibility would have been good on Ubuntu's part, in the system test; on Intel's part, not designing their BIOS so that the system could come close to being bricked like this is what I'd expect from a company that generally has very good Linux contributions and support.  I note that of their NUCs, only three have this bizarre must-be-1024x768 mode problem.  Especially since both monitors supported 1024x768 mode, they just happened to be not in that mode before the attempts to reboot.  Kind of a double fail, by Intel, IMHO.\n", "Q: ubuntu applications segfaults and filesystem remounts with readonly mode i dropped a hard disk. after installing fresh kubuntu 12.04LTS applications keeps segfaulting and filesystem remounts with readonly mode. i checked hard disk for bad sectors but none are found. \n/var/log/messages is empty and /var/log/dmesg contains nothing error like.\nis there a way to use this hard disk?\n\nA: The remounting happens because this line in /etc/fstab:\n/dev/sda1 /               ext4    errors=remount-ro 0       1\n\nWhich tells the system to remount the partition in read-only mode where / resides when a read/write error is detected. (So your data won't get damaged / more damaged.)\nThus I feel that it is likely that your disk got indeed damaged. Though I'm not sure why fsck isn't detecting it as it is supposed to do so.\nAs a temporary solution you can try to reformat the whole drive (as that will mark bad sectors on the disk as unusable and preventing any operations on them), but that is only a temporary solution and on the long run you'll have to get a new disk.(And frankly living with faulty hardware is quite annoying.)\nThe segfault is probably because a block got corrupted on the disk which your program either tries to use or execute.\n", "Q: Remove additional processes/services from Ubuntu server I just installed PostgreSQL 9.1 and its packages: 'postgis and pgadmin' on Ubuntu Server 13.10.\nNow I'd like to remove any other processes/services on the server in order to improve its performance.. what is the most safe way to do that?\n\nA: Install rcconf:\nsudo apt-get install rcconf\n\nAnd then run it with root privileges:\nsudo rcconf\n\nWhat I usually do is disable postgres and start it manually when I need it (I'm only using for my course of database management, so I don't need it running all the time).\nsudo service postgresql-9.1 start\nsudo service postgresql-9.1 stop\n\n", "Q: Ubuntu 13.10 Freeze Problem when maximizing window It doesn't happen always. I've been using Ubuntu 13.10 for few months now- and have been noticing this problem last few weeks only.

Part of the RAM is reserved to the system to use it so it doesn't show as available. In my case I've got 4 GB and I get 3.8 GB under \"About this Computer\".\nRun \"free\" in a terminal and it will tell you how much memory you have got, and how much it is reserved.

The following command can help you:\nfind /usr/include -type d -name sys\nOn my ubuntu 16 got the two\n/usr/include/bsd/sys\n/usr/include/x86_64-linux-gnu/sys\n\nThe first one is home to BSD unix system headers.\nThe second one is a directory containing Linux 64 bits system heads.\nI run into problems with cmake not being able to find the sys/stat.h file.\nMy temporary solution is to make a symbolic link\n/user/local/include/sys/stat.h from /usr/include/x86_64-linux-gnu/sys/stat.h\n\nI don't want to pollute the /usr/include directory, and I am only making a link to one particular header file and not the whole sys directory.  I think this is a defect of cmake, so making minimal impact by making only one link. Hope this may help those who are suffering from the same problem.\n\nA: Since my architecture is amd64 there is no libc6-dev-amd64.

I edited a PDF file attaching \"Sticky Notes\" and emailed it as an attachment to one of my contacts who is seeing the \"Sticky Notes\" icons but cannot open them!  I then opened the emailed attachment on my desktop and sure enough the attachment opened. I'm seeing the icons but I cannot open them also!\nI tried installing the app \"Master PDF Editor\" from Ubuntu Software Center but it would not install. Ubuntu 12.04 is the OS on both my laptop and desktop!\nCan anyone help?  Please note that I am a stranger to terminal use!! \n\nA: Since answering this question, I have come to understand that there is a distinct difference between pdf editing and pdf annotation.  Proper annotation is done using a non-intrusive/non-destructive pdf annotation markup language that can be changed, rearranged & cleaned-up/deleted.  So while xournal and inkscape allow \"annotation\", it is not in this language and it is not necessarily non-destructive.  Meaning, those using other software may not be able to read it, or can only read the part that ended up permanently changing the document.  The only proper annotation software available on linux, that is software using the pdf annotation markup, is the DocuTrak software (below) running under wine.  (As of 2015.)\nAs answered previously:\nI can't help you with Master PDF Editor, but I have used DocuTrak's PDF Xchange Viewer, which allows document annotation.  It's free (as in beer) and it seems they now also have an \"Xchange Editor\" (which I have not explored - perhaps they've just split out the editing functions?):\nhttp://www.tracker-software.com/product/downloads\nIt's a Windows product, but the Viewer, at least, is a stand-alone exe and runs under wine (the MS Win Compatibility Layer).  You can find reports on wine software compatibility at winehq.org.  See, eg.:\nhttp://appdb.winehq.org/objectManager.php?sClass=application&iId=5549\nJust install the package \"wine\" and then follow instructions from there.  I remember it as being quite straightforward.\nThe only other software I've tried for pdf editing (not just annotation) on ubuntu is the pdfedit package, but that's real alpha software.\n\nA: Use the \"hand tool\" under the tools bar\n", "Q: Cannot access local hosts by name, but can by IP address I'm new to Ubuntu and a novice in networking.

The Laptop is a Lenovo Ideapad Z 510 with these specs:\n\n\n*\n\n*CPU: Intel Core i5-4200M, 2x 2.50GHz\n\n*RAM: 8GB (1x 8GB) \n\n*Harddisk: 500GB SSHD (8GB SSD-Cache) \n\n*Drive: DVD+/-RW DL \n\n*Graphic card: NVIDIA GeForce GT 740M, 2GB, HDMI\n\n*OS: FreeDOS\n\n\nTHE PROBLEM:\nShortly after the insallation of Ubuntu starts, the Screen goes completely blank/black.\nThe display is off, there is not back light at all.\nTHESE ARE SOME OBSERVATIONS I MADE:\nWhile the display remains off, I can - at some point - hear that familiar Ubuntu percussion-kind-of drums notification. AND occasionally, when I try to plug in an\nexternal monitor, I can - on the external screen - see the familiar Ubuntu background\n(that redish-violet-organge thing), but nothing happens at all.\nWhen I, at some point, e.g. press the space-bar, 'enter' or 'esc' keys, I can hear that sometimes something is reacting to that (DVD-drive 'roars' or flashdrive changes blinking\npattern). But it does not go any further than this.\nThis is WHAT I HAVE TRIED so far:\nI used USB drives with these different versions:\n\n\n*\n\n*Ubuntu 12.04.3 LTS (64 bit-version 'ubuntu-12.04.3-desktop-amd64.iso')\n\n*Ubuntu 12.04.3 LTS (32 bit-version 'ubuntu-12.04.3-desktop-i386.iso')\n\n*Ubuntu 12.10       (32 bit version 'ubuntu-12.10-desktop-i386.iso')\nI used an image-dvd made from the 64 bit-version 'ubuntu-12.04.3-desktop-amd64.iso'\non a flatmate's Windows-machine.\nTHERE ARE TWO WAYS I have gone about the installation attempts:\nNumber ONE is:\nI opened BIOS and chose from the boot-sequencer to boot from USB or DVD-drive respectively. This strategy led me to the familiar screen with a tiny keyboard and\na tiny human in a cricle at the bottom of the screen. Then the screen went\nempty with a cursor blinking at the top-left corner before going completely dark/back/blank/without-any-light.\nNumber TWO is:\nI left the BIOS and boot-sequencer as it was, just took care that the USB flashsdrive was plugged in (or DVD in the drive). Then I always got this screen that is titled:\n\"GNU GRUB version 1.99-21ubuntu3.10\". Underneath this title, there's this frame that\ncontais the 3 options:\n\n\n*\n\n*Try ubuntu without installing\n\n*Install Ubuntu\n\n*Check disc for defects\nWhichever of the three above option I go for, the screen first goes grey/back lit and then completely dark/back/blank/without-any-light - as if it was switched off.\nIf I don't choose any of these options but hit the 'esc'-key, I always come to a\nscreen that is also titled \"GNU GRUB version 1.99-21ubuntu3.10\". BUT underneath\nthere's no frame or anything. It simply says:\n\"Minimal BASH-like line editing is supported. For the first word, TAB lists possible command completions. Anywhere else TAB lists possible device or file completions.\ngrub> _\"\nThis is all and as detailed I can tell it.\nAfter the rearch I've done so far, I assume it has to do with the graphic card.\nApparently there have been similar issues in the past however, they all had an\nexisting OS (Ubuntu or Windows) installed while dealing with booting-issues.\nHowever, I can't istall Ubuntu.\nAny help is very much appreciated! Thank you!\n\nA: This is a new Haswell system. They generally only work with the newest 64 bit versions of Ubuntu as the hardware is very new.

Running with no arguments shows the current value.\nIt is now as simple as setting the corresponding command to run automatically.\nSimplest way:\nOpen Startup applications (Search in dash) and add an entry with command xbacklight =25. Use your preferred value instead of 25.\nMore complicated way:\nCook up a bash script to detect time of the day and then set the backlight value, and set it to run on startup. Left as an exercise to the reader.\nEven more complicated way:\nDetect light from webcam and the precise position of your favorite electron, destroy universe, rebuild it, and then set backlight to your favorite number.

Does cut & paste work in terminal? As in ctrl+c and ctrl+v?\n\nA: For pasting in the terminal you have to use Ctrl+Shift+V, and for copying, Ctrl+Shift+C.\n\nA: In Ubuntu and Linux in general you have several ways of copying and pasting.\nFor apps not related to a terminal environment you can simply do the following:\nCTRL+C - Copy\nCTRL+V - Paste \nCTRL+X - Cut (Not available in Terminal by default)\nOn the terminal you simply add SHIFT to this shortcuts, like this:\nRIGHT SHIFT+RIGHT CTRL+C - Copy\nRIGHT SHIFT+RIGHT CTRL+V - Paste\nThe difference is that you need to use the Right keys.\nAdditional to this, if you have mouse support, this includes a quicker way to copy and paste information. by simply highlighting a text you are actually copying to a special clipboard that holds the last highlighted text you have selected. To paste this text, either on a non-terminal app or even inside the terminal you can simply click on the middle mouse button. This will paste the last text you have highlighted with your mouse.\n\nA: Ctr + c is used to terminated a program (sending kill signal to current process). I think that there's a way to change that. Google is your friend to find how.\n\nA: You can also use Ctrl+Ins for copy and Shift+Ins for paste\n", "Q: How to patch Wine and use it In playonlinux I have Wine installed with a ppa on my system and I do not want to change it.\nWhat I want to do is to apply a patch to (This one) and use it in Playonlinux.\nI know I can use custom Wine versions in playonlinux, a nice person long time ago send me a patched Wine that I placed in playonlinux wine folder and it used to work.\nSo can some one help me with this ??\nThank you in advanced \n\nA: I'm not sure what you really want to do (use your PPA'd wine in POL? build wine from source for POL?) but here's what I did to patch a beta wine (1.7 at the time of writing) for testing with POL.\nNotes:\n\n\n*\n\n*I'm using wine instead of wine1.7 because it maps to the newest wine so it will work when the beta is 1.8\n\n*I'm building on an amd64 architecture, which means I'm doing it the hard way. I'm assuming most people now are on amd64, so you should be fine. If you are on i386, then life is simpler for you, but unfortunately this guide will not cover you well. Either figure it out on your own or ping me and I'll see how I can help.\n\n\nInstructions\n\n\n*\n\n*Install the ubuntu dev tools: sudo apt-get install ubuntu-dev-tools\n\n*Add the Wine beta PPA to ubuntu as explained here: sudo apt-add-repository -sy ppa:ubuntu-wine/ppa && sudo apt-get update (the -s flag is needed to enable source download)\n\n*Download and patch wine as explained here:\n\n\n*\n\n*Install build dependencies: sudo apt-add-repository -y ppa:ubuntu-wine/ppa\n\n*Download source to a build directory: mkdir -p ~/src/wine-patches; cd ~/src/wine-patches; apt-get source wine\n\n*patch your source: cd wine*-*; patch -p1 < your.patch\n(you may need to massage your patch a bit to fit)\n\n\n*commit your changes to the package: dpkg-source --commit\nThis will ask you for your patch name (just type something that makes sense) then open an editor with a lot of template text followed by the text of your patch. make sure to edit the Description field and remove all the boiler plate comments, then save.\n\n*build the deb: dpkg-buildpackage\n\n*wait... go get a cup of coffee... wait some more... go see a show on tv... wait even more... until it is done.\n\n*get back to the root of the build tree, where dpkg put our deb files: cd ..\n\n*Now, because we are on amd64, we just got some amd64 deb files, and we also need the i386 deb files (that's how wine on amd64 works, as it has to load 32-bit windows binaries). So we'll need to cross-build the i386 binaries (if you are on a i386 already, then you can skip this step):\n\n\n*\n\n*Load some variables: source /etc/lsb-release (I use it so I won't have to know the env code name)\n\n*Create the pbuilder environment for i386: pbuilder-dist $DISTRIB_CODENAME i386 create\n\n*Build wine again with pbuilder: pbuilder-dist $DISTRIB_CODENAME i386 build wine*.dsc --buildresult .\n\n*Wait some more... you know the drill.\n\n\n*Now the next bit is a bit hacky, because dpkg built us some deb files that are meant to be installed to the root of a FSH-compliant Linux system and thus have everything inside a /usr directory, which the PlayOnLinux type install does not need, so we'll need to extract the deb files into a structure that makes sense to POL:\n\n\n*\n\n*create a temporary working area: mkdir root\n\n*extract the deb files: for deb in *.deb; do dpkg -x $deb root; done (this will extract the dev and dbg package as well. I don't care, but if you do - write your own command :-p ).\n\n*The above command creates lots of files in root/usr which we will need to move to the new POL wine tree, but first we'd need to create a base directory: mkdir -p ~/.PlayOnLinux/wine/linux-x86/<version>-<your-patch-name> (I'm installing into the wine 32 bit directory, because I'm only interested in using 32 bit under POL. its possible to install to amd64 if you've built on an amd64).\n\n*Move some files around: mv root/usr/{bin,share} <your-pol-wine-dir>\n\n*Move the correct lib directory: mv root/usr/lib/i386-linux-gnu <your-pol-wine-dir>/lib\nThat's it - your new wine version should be listed in PlayOnLinux's UI and you should be able to use it. This set of instructions are for the beta releases, which tend to be a bit unstable at times - so YMMV. If it doesn't look good, try to repeat the process with a stable version, such as wine1.6.\n", "Q: Nvidia Drivers with Ubuntu 12.04 It's hard to believe how many postings you can find when searching the internet on Nvidia with Ubuntu problems, yet here goes one more:\nI have a NVIDIA GeForce GT 430 video card and a 32bit AMD machine.  I'm dual booting Windows 7 with Ubuntu 12.04 LTS.  I've tried many different ways of installing both the NVIDIA proprietary and Ubuntu packaged drivers as suggested by many different postings.  When things don't work, I get a black screen, or a screen with the default GUI background with no icons.\nMore often than not, the driver (both NVIDIA and Nouveau?) installation DOES appear to work.  What happens is I get a nice hi-res view of the desktop, much better resolution than what I see when using the Live CD.  Some apps work perfectly (Dash, Home, Firefox, and all of the Libre apps).  Other apps (system settings, appearance, software center etc.), an icon appears in the launcher with a \">\" within or next to the icon.  When you point to that icon, it wiggles, but that's about it.  No error message, and no app appears.\nI've spent hours trying to get this to work, and I don't give up easily, and I'm looking for suggestions that will get all functions working.  Thanks in advance.\n\nA: I had a similar problem when I first installed Ubuntu and the Nvidia proprietary drivers. I also got the black screen.\nWhat fixed the black screen issue for me, was to enable \"nomodeset\" in GRUB bootloader.\n\n\n*\n\n*When you have the black screen press Ctrl+Alt+F1 to get to TTY1\n\n*Log in with your username and password.\n\n*Run the following command: sudo nano /etc/default/grub\n\n*Find the like where quite splash is and add nomodeset in front of it.\n\n*Save the change with CTRL+o I think it is (check to be sure, it's written at the buttom of the screen)\n\n*Run sudo update-grub and let it find your installs.\n\n*Run sudo reboot to reboot the computer and check if it worked.\n\n\n`\n", "Q: Totem 3.6 in Ubuntu 12.04?

You may also be able to install it with these commands:\n64bit:\nwget http://launchpadlibrarian.net/136994659/totem_3.6.3-0ubuntu6_amd64.deb\nsudo dpkg -i totem_3.6.3-0ubuntu6_amd64.deb\n\n32bit:\nwget http://launchpadlibrarian.net/136992776/totem_3.6.3-0ubuntu6_i386.deb\nsudo dpkg -i totem_3.6.3-0ubuntu6_i386.deb\n\nThe advantage of this is that you  don't have to compile anything, as in your linked answer. The disadvantage is it might not have the right dependencies, so you might have to download those as well from Ubuntu Updates, or Ubuntu Packages.\nI ain't running any machines currently with 12.04, so I can't test this answe,r but it should work. If the none of the above packages are for the right architecture (32bit/64bit/powerpc/whatever), You should be able to find them here \n\nA: The method to install it is simple. Just use Gdebi:\nsudo apt-get install gdebi-core\nsudo gdebi totem_3.6.3-0ubuntu6_amd64.deb\n\nThat's all.

I had a Windows OS earlier and could use TeamViewer to connect to my Samsung phone and execute actions.\nHowever that was not only very slow but also very slow in response.\nIs there any other way to sort of open a RDP session to the phone from my Ubuntu 13.10?\n\nA: A solution I found recently is scrcpy (scrcpy github page). It lets your pc connect to your phone and you can control your phone through it. It works through adb without any need to install an apk on your android phone beforehand. It streams your phone's screen to your pc, taking into account the rotation, and it allows to send clicks and touches with the mouse and write in text fields directly through your pc's keyboard, although you can only write ascii characters that way.\nSince this only needs adb, it works as long as you achieve an adb connection with your phone, so that includes USB cable and Wifi connection for truly remote control. I don't know how you could do it over the network without being on the same LAN, though.\n\nA: If you would like something simple (i.e. Your phone's screen broke like me...) then you can use AndroidScreencast. Take the jar from here and make sure you have adb working properly then java -jar androidscreencast-*.jar.

To expand my question, I would like to know how to upgrade Ubuntu 12. 04. 0 (kernel version 3. 2, compatible with the Intel GMA3600 driver provided with the package cedarview-drm) to Ubuntu 13. 10, keeping the 3. 2 kernel version for 2D acceleration purposes, and having the latest stable kernel alongside.\nOf course, all this if it is possible.\nHardware here is Acer Aspire One D270, Intel Atom Processor with Intel GMA3600 (as mentioned, best driver option for this one is cedarview-drm, although gma500_gfx does give basic functions).\n\nA: The cedarview package is only available for installation in Precise (12.04) as can be seen in the package page.

On the downloads page, you have the following two options:\n\n  \n*\n  \n*64-bit\n  \n*32-bit (for machines with less than 2GB RAM)\n\nAssuming you have a 32-bit machine with the maximum 4GB of RAM, will Ubuntu will work on that?\n\nA: Yes, the 32-bit version works on both 64 and 32 machines whatever RAM amount they have. \n\nA: By default, any 32-bit OS cannot index more than 4Gb of RAM and Ubuntu is not exclusion.\nBut Ubuntu has 2 different kernels: standard and patched(Physical Address Extension - PAE). Now Ubuntu 32-bit used this patched kernel by default and so it can manage up to 64Gb of RAM.\nAnd Ubuntu websites says 32-bit (for machines with less than 2GB RAM) because of RAM usage. 64-bit software use a more RAM than 32-bit.\nClean Ubuntu 32-bit installation (Unity) use about 600Mb of memory, 64-bit installation takes about 100Mb more. And for modern software 2Gb of RAM is not so much and it can easily be used(say 10 tabs in Chrome can use a lot of RAM).\nThat's why Ubuntu website recommends use 32-bit for computers with less than 2Gb of RAM. But that doesn't mean you cannot install Ubuntu 64-bit on such computer configuration.\n\nA: Since I'm running 13.10 at the moment (it was installed with an upgrade, not via Live CD), I can testify that it does work on a system with 4GB of RAM. \nI would assume the wording is just a way to help out \"beginners\" in computing, something like _\"If you have less than 2GB of RAM, chances are, this is the option you want.\" However, if a beginner knows how much RAM they have, chances are they know if it's a 32 or 64 bit system.\n", "Q: Should i enable zram and/or lower swappiness value?

I have a AMD Radeon HD 4870 Graphics Card. On 12.04 I used AMD Proprietary drivers from their website and had no problems but since switching to 13.10 when I tried to install the Drivers it says that there are fglrx tools missing that need to be there for install. I tried using apt-get to install fglrx, and when the download finished I rebooted my PC and said that the graphics drivers were no good and I had to reinstall 13.10. So I can't just apt-get the fglrx drivers like I have done previously. Does anyone have a solution and does anyone else have this issue? I would like to have the Catalyst Control Centre but that comes with the proprietary drivers not with the radeon open source drivers. I also use a 32 bit system if that helps. Thanks\n\nA: I do not think that AMD is supporting the 2xxx,3xxx,and 4xxx cards anymore.  There are legacy drivers for them, but they do not work for the newer kernels after 12.04.  There is a work around for them but from what I read, it is a 50/50 chance of it working, and you probably have to rework it after system updates. It might break your system also, use at your own risk.   I think your best bet would be to use the open source drivers, unless you must have the Radeon drivers for your system, you could reinstall 12.04.

Pavucontrol on the Output Devices tab shows only the main audio device, but according to guides over the web, bluetooth audio should appear there.\nSo... Once i have the bluetooth speaker connected, how do i direct sound there?\nSome dumps that might be relevant:\n$ pacmd list-sinks\nWelcome to PulseAudio!

I do not intent to send bulk/spam email.\nIs there a way to make all my email accounts created on different domain names under my VPS to send emails to the Inbox folder of other email accounts? \nFor example when I send to gmail my emails go to inbox, but when I send to hotmail they go to the spam folder.\nThanks\n\nA: Your domain isn't on the major blacklists and there's no problem with your SMTP server or settings (you've got it set rather well, actually). You will have to sort out your issue with sending to Yahoo email addresses with the support people at Yahoo as it is their blocking policy that's preventing delivery. Given their recent security issues, this may not be a surprising outcome of their trying to lock down their systems...\nFor the Gmail vs. Hotmail issue, it's probably their respective mail filtering algorithms that result in the Inbox vs. Spam folder issue. Again, that's something you would have to work out with Hotmail support.\n\nA: The Yahoo Help page for that error is: https://help.yahoo.com/kb/mail/SLN3437.html?impressions=true\nSince it is a new server you just set up, it probably doesn't have any complaints. What are the chances the IP address was previously used by someone with a mail server that generated complaints?\nAlso, if you're sending out emails that look like spam to a computer (even if they're actually legitimate), that will play a part in the rejection.

I recently upgraded to Ubuntu 13.10. In Ubuntu 12.04, I was able to define a key which, while holding it, temporarily switched to a different keyboard layout. I haven't been able to find a way to get that functionality in 13.10: the only option seems to be to toggle between different layouts using the \"Switch to next source\" shortcut.\nIs there a way to get the \"hold a key to temporarily switch to a different keyboard layout\" functionality in 13.10?\n\nA: *\n\n*With Gnome 3.6, layout setting method changed. So Ubuntu 13.10 and later, has different behavior then before. This should work well in Gnome (Tested Ubuntu 13.10/14.04).\n\n*Unity seems not to use xkb-options (Tested it in Ubuntu 13.10/14.04). Even using for example:\nsetxkbmap us,ara -option grp:rctrl_switch\n\nIt just works for seconds, then it is reseted.\nEdit /usr/share/X11/xkb/symbols/pc, Remove rctrl from ctrl binding:\n//modifier_map Control{ Control_L, Control_R };\nmodifier_map Control{ Control_L };\n\nagain:\nsetxkbmap us,ara -option grp:rctrl_switch\n\nIt just works, till it I use change my layout using Super+Space or directly from indicator. So as workaround for Unity, Disable layout toggle shortcuts (layout indicator could removed too) then add a -option grp:..._toggle to setxkbmap .\nSo for Gnome:\n\n\n*\n\n*Use dconf-editor → org → gnome → desktop → input-sources\n\n*Add setxkbmap options to xkb-options, example:\n['grp:rctrl_switch']\n\nTo see all possible options:\nmore /usr/share/X11/xkb/rules/xorg.lst | grep grp:\n\n\n\nA: Please follow these steps:\n\n\n*\n\n*Select System Settings... from system menu;\n\n\n*Select Keyboard;\n\n\n*Under the tab labelled Typing click Layout Settings;\n\n\n*In the Keyboard settings window, under Shortcuts tab, select Typing. The default for Switch to next source is Super+SPACE; clicking on it will ask you to assign a New Accelerator..., press the desired key combination to change to next Layout (I used Super+L.) and it will be assigned to change to next layout.\n(Then I assigned something similar for Switch to previous source using the same preferred layout, and then began to test them. Switching from the preferred layout to the alternate worked but the reverse did not. Please refer the next step for the fix.)\n\n\n*In the same window you can select/assign Compose key. The preferred one is Right Alt\n\n\n*After assigning Super+L for \"Switch to next source\" using my preferred layout, I changed my keyboard layout to the alternative layout and then assigned the combination to \"Switch to previous source\" (for which I used Shift+Super+L). Then I tested them, and they work fine.\nThe new accelerators for the key combos that I used looks like this:\n\n\nUseful Links:\n\n\n*\n\n*How can I enable Compose key?\n\n*How can I type accentuated characters like ë? alt.

Alt \" o .\n\n*For ß you press Compose followed by s then s keys. \n\n\n(..here you'd have to remember the two character combination)\nYou can get the combination for compose key (and Unicode number) with this command in terminal:\ncat /usr/share/X11/locale/en_US.UTF-8/Compose | grep ö\n\n(where ö should be replaced by the character of your choice.)\nwhich would output something like:\n<Multi_key> <quotedbl> <o>          : \"ö\"   odiaeresis\n\n(where <Multi_Key> is the Compose (Shift or Shift+Rt.Alt) key, <quotedbl> is the double quote - \" i.e.  Shift+' and <o> is the lowercase o i.e. o. For upper case Ö use O i.e. Shift+o and  instead for the last character of compose combo.)\nUsing hexadecimal Unicode character code point:\n\n\n*\n\n*Press (and release) Shift+Ctrl+U, then, while underlined u is displayed, enter the hexadecimal Unicode character code point followed by Return or Space.\n\n\ne.g. Ctrl+Shift+u followed by 2 6 3 b and then Return or Space for ☻ . \n(..so this one would require you to remember the Unicode number)\n☻ cheers...\n\nA: Since asking the question, I've switched to Linux Mint 17 with the Cinnamon desktop.

So basically when I am trying open a link http://project1.localdomain.local in a browser it works. But when I do it on my computer with fresh ubuntu installation it doesn't. It looks like ubuntu can't resolve local domain where DNS server is.\nSo my network looks like that:\n10.10.16.1 - DNS server - windows server\ndomain - test\nI've already tried resolved the problem adding lines to /etc/resolve.conf file\ndomain test\nnameserver 10.10.16.2\n\n/etc/NetworkManager/NetworkManager.conf file I commented out line \n#dns=dnsmasq\n\n/etc/dhcp/dhclient.conf I added lines\nsupersede domain-name \"test\";\nprepend domain-name-servers 10.10.16.1, 10.10.16.2;\n\nBut it doesn't work.\nOn windows or mac I don't have to do any additional configuration to make it work.\nThis is the contents of /etc/nsswitch.conf: \npasswd:         compat\ngroup:          compat\nshadow:         compat\n\nhosts:          files mdns4_minimal [NOTFOUND=return] dns mdns4\nnetworks:       files\n\nprotocols:      db files\nservices:       db files\nethers:         db files\nrpc:            db files\n\nnetgroup:       nis\n\n\nA: Change hosts line:\nhosts:          files dns mdns4_minimal [NOTFOUND=return] mdns4\n\n.local is used by mDNS (Avahi), dns should comes first.\nSee http://www.lowlevelmanager.com/2011/09/fix-linux-dns-issues-with-local.html\n", "Q: How to use GNOME tweak tool to get shell themes So I'm trying to get custom shells and have tried using this as many people have recommended it. All I see in the Shell Extensions menu is \"install shell extension\" and when I click on the link user themes isn't there. Also, in the theme menu, there is a triangle with an exclamation mark in it next to Shell Theme. how can I fix this and get shell themes like  Faience?\n\nA: To get a user specified shell theme, use this extension:\nUser Themes - GNOME Shell Extensions. Install it from the extension, page and make sure it is on in gnome-tweak-tool:\n\nand here are the results - with it off, and with it on:\n\nYou can then use gnome-tweak-tool, or dconf-tools (use org.gnome.shell.extensions.user-theme name NAME_OF_THEME) to set the theme - here is Gnome Tweak Tool again:\n\nBy the way, I recommend the Zukiwi Theme - you may be able to install that with:\nsudo apt-get install zukiwi\n\n\nFor your original question, as this is useful also for reference:\nTo fix some shell extension that also have the warning triangle, particularly after an update:\nFirst, go to here, and see if any update icons are displayed.\nIf that does not work, first find your version of Gnome by running this:\n gnome-shell --version\n\nIn my case, this is 3.10.3, but I only need the 3.10 bit.\nThen open Nautilus (File Manager), open the location bar (Ctrl+L), and enter this:\n~/.local/share/gnome-shell/extensions\n\nAlternately, view hidden file with Ctrl+H, and open .local > share > etc\nFind the folder with the extension in - For instance, Status are Horizontal Spacing, by mathematicalcoffee, is in this folder:\nstatus-area-horizontal-spacing@mathematical.coffee.gmail.com\n\nOpen up the folder, then open the file metadata.json. Find these lines:\n  \"shell-version\": [\n    \"3.4\", \n    \"3.6\", \n    \"3.8\"\n  ],\n\nand add your version of Gnome in if it is not present:\n  \"shell-version\": [\n    \"3.4\", \n    \"3.6\", \n    \"3.8\",\n    \"3.10\"\n  ],\n\nNote where you need the commas ,. Save and exit, and after reloading the shell (Alt+F2, enter r, and press Enter), the extension should work. If the warning triangle is still there, then it is probably some other problem.\n", "Q: Syncing a folder on computer with external drive I know that there are some file sync options (particularly rsync) available, but I'm trying to do something specific with my sync.

Using Ubuntu 12.04, How do I install this correctly?\n\nEthereum is a next-generation distributed cryptographic ledger that is\n  designed to allow users to encode advanced transaction types, smart\n  contracts and decentralized applications into the blockchain. Ethereum\n  will support custom currencies or \"colored coins\", financial\n  derivatives, and much more, but unlike many previous networks that\n  attempted to accomplish the same thing Ethereum does not attempt to\n  constrain users into using specific \"features\"; instead, the ledger\n  includes a built-in Turing-complete programming language that can be\n  used to construct any kind of contract that can be mathematically\n  defined.\n\n\nA: These are packages you need to build Ethereum:\nsudo apt-get install build-essential libgmp-dev libgmp3-dev libcrypto++-dev \ngit cmake libboost-all-dev automake libtool libleveldb-dev \nyasm unzip libminiupnpc-dev\n\nThen grab and build the latest cryptopp:\nmkdir cryptopp562\ncd cryptopp562\nwget http://www.cryptopp.com/cryptopp562.zip\nunzip cryptopp562.zip\nmake\ncd ..\n\nThen grab and build the SECP256k1 crypto lib:\nwget http://gavwood.com/secp256k1.tar.bz2\ntar xjf secp256k1.tar.bz2\ncd secp256k1\n./configure && make\ncd ..\n\nThen build the client; for this you can either get the latest sources from the Git repo:\ngit clone https://github.com/ethereum/cpp-ethereum\nmkdir cpp-ethereum-build\ncd cpp-ethereum-build\ncmake ../cpp-ethereum -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release\nmake\ncd ..\n\nOr, if you’re building from the released tarball:\ntar xzf cpp-ethereum-poc-1.tar.gz\nmkdir cpp-ethereum-build\ncd cpp-ethereum-build\ncmake ../cpp-ethereum-poc-1 -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release\nmake\ncd ..\n\nYou might then Configure a Server.

Installed the NVIDIA drivers for GTX660Ti but haven't yet run the updates. The manual for CUDA says I should now move to a tty via Ctrl+Alt+F1 but that brings a black screen, and the monitor goes to sleep showing nothing.

I am wondering if there is a way of delete non-used package without using Ubuntu tweaks.\nAnd if there is a way of deleting  old kernels.\n\nA: sudo apt-get autoremove \n\nwill search for and then prompt  \"y or n\"  if you wish to remove unneeded packages; the same thing as Ubuntu Tweak's remove unused packages does \nAs far as the second half of your question:\nIf there is a similar way to remove older kernels, I'm unaware of it, the only way I know of is to remove them(and their headers, if present) for each old kernel with either the Software Center or Synaptic... \nI personally find Synaptic easier to use if needing to remove something as the \"Mark for complete removal\" will also remove the configuration files as well and it gives more detailed info about the package, making it easier to check that it is the correct file if you are unsure of the exact name.  Conversely, I find the Software Center more useful for browsing programs and in general for installing.\nSynaptic is not installed by default any longer (since 11.10) but can still be installed via the Software Center or by the terminal with\nsudo apt-get install synaptic \n\n....of course you can remove them with sudo apt-get -purge linux-image-generic-XXX but that will get tedious very quickly if you have many to remove. \nNo matter how you remove kernels I would sudo update-grub after...(this should not be needed if you use Ubuntu Tweak, I believe that it does this as part of the cleaning, but I always do it manually anyways after Ubuntu tweak is done)\n\nEdit: \naccording to a comment by MrVaykadji in 13.04 and newer, sudo apt-get autoremove will prompt for removal of older kernels.  I don't believe that this is true in 12.04, however, I use Ubuntu Tweak's \"janitor\" feature often enough that 12.04 may do it but I have never waited long enough for it to trigger....at on time I had a decent number of older kernels after a long pause between Ubuntu Tweak runs and with 4(or so) older kernels, autoremove did not trigger.\n", "Q: Can't get pass the GRUB menu on 12.04 I can't boot to Ubuntu 12.04 LTS;I get a blinking curso and my caps key led keeps flashing.\nI've tried recovery mode and it gives thesame error.I've tried loading previous version from the grub menu and have thesame error.

I'm experimenting with the webkit greeter for lightdm. Ubuntu 13.10 64 bits. I want to learn to create my own themes. I noticed that the default theme does not show a language select button or a session type select button. With the unity-greeter I can choose to start Unity or Gnome 3. Recently I started to prefer Gnome 3, that means that the webkit greeter is unusable to me right now as I'm forced to start with Unity when I want Gnome 3.\nIs It possible to add a session type button to a webkit-greeter theme? How? Must I edit the default theme files to show the button?\n\nA: If you look at lightdm-webkit-greeter.c in the source code, there are all sorts of interesting values we can get at from webkit. For a quick and dirty method to add a session selection dropdown to the default theme I did the following (this could definitely be expanded and improved upon):\nIn the default index.html, right above the line that writes the user list to the greeter:\ndocument.write('<table id=\"user_table\" style=\"margin: auto;\">');\n\nI added some code to write out the session selector:\ndocument.write('<select id=\"session_list\">');\nfor (i in lightdm.sessions)\n{\n  session = lightdm.sessions[i];\n  if (session.key == lightdm.default_session)\n    document.write('<option selected=\"selected\" value=\"' + session.key + '\">' + session.name + '</option>');\n  else\n    document.write('<option value=\"' + session.key + '\">' + session.name + '</option>');\n}\ndocument.write('</select>');\n\nThe value attributes aren't really necessary in this code, I was going to use them to select the session, but decided to use the index instead. The other change is to the authentication_complete() function. In the default code we have:\nif (lightdm.is_authenticated)\n  lightdm.login (lightdm.authentication_user, lightdm.default_session);\n\nSo it always uses the default_session key. We want to instead use the selected session, so we can do something like:\nif (lightdm.is_authenticated)\n{\n  session_list = document.getElementById('session_list');\n  session = lightdm.sessions[session_list.selectedIndex];\n  lightdm.login (lightdm.authentication_user, session.key);\n}\n\n", "Q: apt-get won't upgrade old generic-pae Running #apt-get upgrade I am told to run sudo apt-get -f install.

Recently I noticed two things in my Ubuntu-13.10(32-bit) and would like to get cleared.\nScenario-1:\nOne of the functionality of terminal is that you can get previous commands by using \"UP\" arrow key. But when I used up arrow, it was showing me all commands that I am using since last many days. I have switched off my laptop many times since then. (I am not hibernating it, I completely shut it down each time)\nQuestion:\nHow is Ubuntu remembering all this commands ? Does it saves the states in some kind of cache or something ?? \nScenario-2:\nSimilar was the case with pdf files. \nWhen I opened a pdf in one of the in-built \"Document Reader\", it directly started from the page where I last left reading.\nQuestion:\nAgain the same question arose and that is \"How did Ubuntu came to know that I left on that particular page?\" \nIt may be the cache issue but I guess cache in ubuntu is cleared completely at every shutdown. \nThanks,\n\nA: Scenario 1\nThe commands are simply saved as a list to the ~/.bash_history file. this is a hidden file (Begins with .), in your home directory (~). You can view the history of commands run by running history, which is similar to cat -n ~/.bash_history, except the latter does not include commands from the current running terminal session, as those are saved when the terminal closes. Here is the manual page for history:\n   history [n]\n   history -c\n   history -d offset\n   history -anrw [filename]\n   history -p arg [arg ...]\n   history -s arg [arg ...]\n          With no options, display the command history list with line num‐\n          bers.  Lines listed with a * have been modified.  An argument of\n          n lists only the last n lines.  If the shell variable  HISTTIME‐\n          FORMAT  is  set  and not null, it is used as a format string for\n          strftime(3) to display the time stamp associated with each  dis‐\n          played  history  entry.  No intervening blank is printed between\n          the formatted time stamp and the history line.  If  filename  is\n          supplied,  it  is  used as the name of the history file; if not,\n          the value of HISTFILE is used.  Options, if supplied,  have  the\n          following meanings:\n          -c     Clear the history list by deleting all the entries.\n          -d offset\n                 Delete the history entry at position offset.\n          -a     Append  the  ``new'' history lines (history lines entered\n                 since the beginning of the current bash session)  to  the\n                 history file.\n          -n     Read  the history lines not already read from the history\n                 file into the current  history  list.   These  are  lines\n                 appended  to  the history file since the beginning of the\n                 current bash session.\n          -r     Read the contents of the history file and use them as the\n                 current history.\n          -w     Write  the current history to the history file, overwrit‐\n                 ing the history file's contents.\n          -p     Perform history substitution on the  following  args  and\n                 display  the  result  on  the  standard output.  Does not\n                 store the results in the history list.  Each arg must  be\n                 quoted to disable normal history expansion.\n          -s     Store  the  args  in  the history list as a single entry.\n                 The last command in the history list  is  removed  before\n                 the args are added.\n\n          If  the  HISTTIMEFORMAT variable is set, the time stamp informa‐\n          tion associated with each history entry is written to  the  his‐\n          tory  file, marked with the history comment character.  When the\n          history file is read, lines beginning with the  history  comment\n          character  followed  immediately  by  a digit are interpreted as\n          timestamps for the previous history line.  The return value is 0\n          unless  an  invalid option is encountered, an error occurs while\n          reading or writing the history file, an invalid offset  is  sup‐\n          plied as an argument to -d, or the history expansion supplied as\n          an argument to -p fails.\n\nScenario 2\nDunno where that would be - Document Viewer - evince - has config files in ~/.config/evince, but nothing seems useful there. There is a local cache directory - ~/.cache - where it could be...\nFor the current session on the computer, temporary storage (Like opening compressed files in Archive Manager) is done in /tmp, and is cleared on shutdown.

When you install Ubuntu, one of the steps is configuring itself for your particular hardware. Therefore, it would be configured to run on your virtual machine, not your server. It would be possible to run Ubuntu in an identical virtual machine in your server, but that would require keyboard and mouse access.\nIn short, it is possible, but very unstable. As a result, it's probably not what you want.\n", "Q: External webcam not detected I have a Lubuntu 13.10 installed on a HP Pavillon dv6000.\nI just bought a new webcam, Make is Growing, model is \"Impala PC Camera\".\nI want to use it with skype, but it is not detected at all.

I want the shortcut Ctrl+Backspace to perform the same operation as if I pressed Ctrl+Home.  The reason is because my new keyboard does not have a home button, and yet I find Ctrl+Home so useful.   I went to Ubuntu 12.04 Keyboard pop up window, clicked on Custom Shortcuts at the bottom left.  Then I pressed the plus sign to add a new rule.  It asked my for a name and for a command.  For the name I wrote 'my special ctrlhome'.  For the command, I pressed down Ctrl+Backspace, but that didn't do anything.\nHow do I map Ctrl+Backspace to the same key combo as Ctrl+Home?\n\nA: Try installing and running xbindkeys-config\nThen having it run xdotool key Ctrl+Home when that key combination is pressed.\n\nA: Install xdotool:\nsudo apt-get install xdotool\n\nThis command simulates key presses.\nOpen Keyboard settings, and go to Shortcuts. Press the '+' button to add your Custom shortcut, and enter this as the command:\n xdotool key Ctrl+Home\n\nThis seemed to work in terminal, just it does not seem to work as a shortcut... even with bash -c \"xdotool... \"...\nUsing this worked in terminal: sleep 5; xdotool key Ctrl+Home - just select near the end of some text you have typed elsewhere, and wait for the cursor thing to move\n", "Q: Ubuntu 13.04/13.10 won't trust iPhone Users have reported issues with connecting their iPhones 5 to Ubuntu 13.04 and 13.10.

The equivalent in the non-ldap world would be to use openssl s_client to connect over port 80 rather than port 443. In the case of port 80, there's no SSL/TLS and you will get a similar failure.\nHave you tried port 636? I believe that LDAPS or Secure-LDAP. See, for example, How to enable LDAP over SSL with a third-party certification authority.\nOtherwise, you'll need to figure out how to make OpenLDAP start SSL/TLS on port 389.\n", "Q: No partitions are visible during ubuntu installation I'm trying to dual boot ubuntu alongside windows. 8 I've tried many times with various versions, but the full hdd 500 gb is displayed with no partitions.

Regular users should not be able to access the individual PCs. They should only be able to submit computation tasks through qsub.\nAlso, regular users should have access to storage on the cluster. Ideally, a regular user should not see where his/her files are located on individual PCs. He should see the cluster as a single storage location. And he should have access only to his files. \nMoreover, a process running for a particular user should have access to that user's files.\nHow can I accomplish all this?\nRight now the cluster runs on Ubuntu with torque + maui. It has several issues that I need to fix. One of them is that users can ssh to individual PCs and run processes there, violating the queue.\nI am new to linux and clusters, so try giving an answer as introductory as possible. Also, links to no-nonsense tutorials on these topics will also be helpful.\n\nA: You could explicitly prohibit running certain programs for common users (however they might still be able to run some interpreted language, if you forbid e.g. make, gcc). \nBetter approach would be using cgroups (introduced to linux kernel in 2.6.29 - your kernel should support them) or some light virtualization (lxc-containers).\nSee: https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/cgroups \nWith cgroups you could limit user to 1 CPU (or even less) and 50MB RAM, which would allow user using ssh access but not really running expensive calculation (if user exceeds limit, the process will be killed).\n", "Q: Ubuntu doesn't mount iPod I cannot access my iPod files even though the iPod is found by Ubuntu.\nOutput of lsusb\nBus 002 Device 004: ID 05ac:129e Apple, Inc. iPod Touch 4.Gen\nOutput of dmesg\n[  118.991968] usb 2-1.2: Product: iPod\n[  118.991973] usb 2-1.2: Manufacturer: Apple Inc.\n[  118.991978] usb 2-1.2: SerialNumber: f8c18467afcfbf51bb4109357a1e38a17a4af67f\nI am using Ubuntu 13.10\nThanks in advance.\n\nA: The reason is iPod touch doesn't support USB mass-storage, you can find some answers here:\nIpod Touch not mounted\n", "Q: Steam(Windows) on Ubuntu 12.04 using PlayOnLinux I am running Ubuntu 12.04 and I am trying to run Steam (Windows) through PlayOnLinux.

My understanding is that if I do this Ubuntu will be able to treat the two drives as one. That's great, but I also want to able to distinguish between the two drives because one is a solid state and one is not. Will I still be able to have a C and D drive with LVM, i.e. can I intentionally save a file to one verses the other?\n\nA: You will indeed be able to choose where the logical volumes take their physical extents from.  For illustration (taken from shell history):\nsudo lvcreate VG -n LogicalName --alloc cling -L 500M /dev/dev0\n\nThe above flags can also be passed to lvchange when the volume already exists. This will move data from one disk to another:\nsudo pvmove -n LogicalName /dev/dev0 /dev/dev1\n\nAlso, to avoid micromanagement of which file goes on which drive, I recommend running bcache on top of LVM.\n", "Q: LAN transfer speed When I try to download various files from various hdd`s hosted on my Ubuntu 13.10 server, I get a maximum of 60Mbps.

This slowdown effect occurs no matter which card I currently have enabled.\nHere are the Power settings I had in my BIOS when I wrote this report:\n\nI've since tried moving the Adaptive Thermal Management's Scheme for AC to be \"Balanced\" like it is for Battery, and tried moving the Intel SpeedStep setting for AC to be \"Battery Optimized\" like it is for Battery. I even disabled Wake-on-LAN, which had been set to \"AC only\". None of these eliminated the slowdown effect when plugging in AC power.\nI haven't found anything that isolates and talks about this on Ask Ubuntu or Launchpad or the Internet. The closest thing is this thread on 11.10, which might be the same, but it's unanswered, and I don't see the same CPU patterns (though it's possible my 8 cores make the CPU changes less noticeable). What's going on?\nEdit: removed some lines about the Thermal Table, added the photo and more details about BIOS changes I've made since then.\n\nA: After a long story which began with the same analysis as you told - power cable plug in => slow down the system - I found a solution and another better reproducible situation which works for me.\nAfter waking up the system from suspend to ram the system is remarkable slow. I checked after a tip of a colleague the cpu frequency and the set governor. But the governor was set to performance (watch -s 1 'cat /sys/devices/system/cpu/cpu0/cpufreq/scaling_governor') and all cpu seems to run with full MHz. (watch -n 1 'cat /proc/cpuinfo | grep MHz'). It seems that this information is not really reliable. After setting the governor to e.g. ondemand and than back to performance the system runs again as expected: fast!\nFor me the suspend to ram thing is a reproducible situation where the system slows down. But I think there are maybe also some other situations like the power cable  - sometimes. And I had also a situation where the governor was automatically set to ondemand if I put some load to the cpu. Only a restart of the system stopped this behaviour.\nFor setting the governor i used this as a source: http://wiki.ubuntuusers.de/Prozessortaktung (German only) the tool for unity e.g. is indicator-cpufreq sudo apt-get install indicator-cpufreq relogin or start it afterwards with indicator-cpufreq.\nBugs which might be interesting in this context:\nhttps://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/linux/+bug/1188647\nhttps://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/linux/+bug/1233479 \n\nA: I have a (seemingly) very similar issue on a Lenovo ThinkPad T61: (sometimes) when the laptop is plugged-in, it is very slowish. I plug-out the adapter, and the slowness stops. \nHere I notice the following symptoms: \n\n\n*\n\n*The kworker or watchdog process is going haywire, spiking at 100% CPU every ~1sec (see also: Kworker, what is it and why is it hogging so much CPU?)\n\n*This causes UI freezes and essentially renders Ubuntu unusable\n\n*When I type any text in any program then I experience freezes, and dyslexic typing (like: \"dystyping\")\n\n*The green lights of my network ethernet controller is always on\n\n\nI tracked it down to the following: it looks like the kernel is being under a shower of IRQ interrupts, possibly due to faulty behavior at driver level in the kernel. Apparently this is a known issue related to ACPI interrupt calls, but obviously it hasn't been fixed yet in the kernel for specific hardware (like ours). \nSolution:\n\n\n*\n\n*The workaround that you suggested, unplugging, works here too. But this is only temporary. \n\n*The \"definitive\" workaround is to do a cold reboot. You need to shutdown the laptop (NOT just reboot), if necessary even remove the charger and the battery after the shutdown, to make sure that nothing weird is happening. Then boot again. Usually this gets rid of the issue (and the ethernet lights turn off). \n\n\n*\n\n*Sometimes this is insufficient, and you need to make sure that the charger is disconnected while the kernel initializes at boot time. I usually wait until the login screen to avoid surprises. \n\n\n\nThis said, I'm still hoping for a nicer solution to this issue. The workaround is aggravating. Does it help? \n\nA: We had the same problem (on a T520), and thanks to Honza's answer, we found that using a 90W adapter instead of the 65W adapter fixed the problem for us too (thanks!).\nAfter some googling, I found an explanation here:\nhttp://linux-thinkpad.10952.n7.nabble.com/WARNING-Lenovo-ThinkPads-and-65W-power-supplies-td13173.html\nBasically according to this post \"the 65W power supplies alone are NOT sufficient to power the notebook in all scenarios...and the firmware knows this.\"  \nThe post seems to imply that if your battery is charged then the performance won't be throttled because it can draw on both the 3.25A supply and/or the battery to supply a peak load without being underpowered, but if your battery is not present or not charged, then the cpu frequency will be throttled as a safety measure if it determines that your supply is underpowered. \n\nA: I'm having similar problem with Lenovo ThinkPad L540 - on battery FPS in 3D game are around 70, when on AC power, FPS drops to 20. Finally I've found why.\nHave a look at the power adaptor. I have output 3.25A. I tried to plug 4.5A and the problem dissappeared!\nSorry for posting in \"Ubuntu\" forum since I have W8 :-) But I think that doesn't change anything.\n", "Q: Modify Indicator Appearence I've found a theme that I really like (Flatstudio for anyone interested), but there is only one minor thing that works not as expected: \n\nif you look at the screenshot at the indicator-messaging menu, it looks really great (icons are from the Numix icon-theme) but the \"bulletpoint\" which indicates the online-status has the same color as the menu background color, and is therefore invisible...\nI do not want to change the color of the menu, but the color of the bulletpoint which is possible, because other themes have different colors.

I just finally got a successful Installation Complete window but upon restarting got the same message I've had for the last week, \"Operating System not found\". I appreciate that there are a few similar questions on here but with so many answers suggested I don't know what to do. I've just run Boot Repair, which failed to make a difference but gave me this link: paste.ubuntu.com/6863876 . Any help is much appreciated; I'm trying hard not to give up. Thanks!\n\nA: \"operating system not found\" is a hardware message and it means that the hard disk doesn't have a valid boot sector.\nInstall your operating system once again and when asked, choose to install the boot loader in the master boot record of the first disk.\nIf you are in doubt, remove additional hard disks and usb memory sticks before the installation. Install from a CD media.\n\nA: Its hard to tell since i dont know how you partitioned your disk or how many hard drives you actually have in your laptop. Either way, i think your best shot would be to give it a fresh install. What i mean by that is, if possible, format your drive and reinstall ubuntu once again.

Or is it like the linked question that you have one IP?\nDo i smell a cheap router that have one IP, runs nat and port forwarding on the mentioned ports? \n\n\n*\n\n*It is often so with cheap routers that they have issues with combining nat and portforwarding using external addresses to reach other internal machines. Some also fail this on purpose as it is bad practice to send all your internal load thought your gateway/nat router.\n\n\nBoth dns records (myhost1.example.com and example.com) points to the same public IP? \n\n\n*\n\n*yes, and that is intentional and correct, but what happens?\n\n\n*\n\n*When the Apache instance wanna lookup where to do the proxy connection it will be told the external IP of myhost01.example.com that is pointing back to the router that might fail the connection. Lets assume it does.\n\n\n\nWe found one possible error, how do we work around it?\n\n\n*\n\n*As the external IP from the dns will not help server1 to find the local IP to go over the local network do we need a way to do it, luckily does it exist many ways to Rome.\n\n\n*\n\n*One way would be to use the local IP of server2 in the ProxyPass.\n\n*Another way would be to simply override your dns answers. That can be done on server1 that serves as the proxy. Edit the file /etc/hosts. Some more info about the hosts file can you read here.\n\n*A 3rd way would be to make extra dns records for your local servers. Eg a entry named eg. local2.example.com pointing to 192.168.0.7.\n\n\n\nNote. If you wondered, it is fully possible to have more public IP's and run them on a little subnet eg. that will also be serving as the interconnection. Thought it is not very recommended to do so. \nDisclaimer\nThis answer is based on an experienced guess, as complete configuration, Apache logs and errors are lacking from the answer. Feel free to improve.\n\nA: Your approach seems like overkill.  \nAll modern web servers will allow you to bind multiple web sites to a single ip address and port.  This is done by configuring the host header name for the respective sites.  \nAdditionally, you can point multiple SSL sites to the same ip address and port (443 or whatever) by the use of SNI.  Older browsers don't support SNI, but that might not be a concern for you.\nHooking one of the sites to port 8080 and then wiring a proxy over it is the long way, unless there's an explicit need for port 8080 to be exposed to a client somehow.\nBeing the busy guy that I am, I don't spend a lot of time on Apache configuration unless I absolutely need to.  Otherwise, I use Virtualmin (http://www.webmin.com/virtualmin.html) and it handles 85% of the dirty work for such  configuration.\n", "Q: change directory during Install of deb packages for libreoffice 4.2 producing no file found cmd line I am sure I am missing something simple here so apologies in advance if I missed the answered somewhere else.\nI am relatively new to linux, have had ubuntu 12.04.4  lts installed for about 2 years now.

Migrated from 12.10 to 13.10 a couple of days ago. \nI speak English, British English. I have a British layout keyboard. Now I have a square symbol in the top bar (or whatever it's proper name is) with En1 in and when I click on that there is an En2 (American English).\nMigration took two attempts. The first was via the Upgrade path straight from 12.10 which meant I kept all my settings and files and folders (or so I thought). However I was obliged to bin the whole lot and essentially start again when I discovered that during the upgrade Ubuntu didn't recognize my keyboard correctly - I no longer had a \"£\", and instead of @ I received \" when typing in my email address (!!)\nAt this time I noticed the En language symbol in the top bar.\nI binned the OS and thereafter I downloaded 13.10 straight from Ubuntu, burned to disc, loaded on. \nKeyboard working now as it should BUT language symbol still there. \nIs it (the language symbol) supposed to be there?

(Shudder)\nIn fact, triple-booting OS X, Windows, and Linux on a Mac is a bit of a nightmare, no matter how you do it. IMHO, the best way to tackle such needs generally involves using a virtual machine for at least one OS. That reduces the need for extreme expertise or weird shudder-inducing setups that will break the next time you look at it cross-eyed.\nIf you must triple-boot, I recommend starting over again:\n\n\n*\n\n*Read my page on hybrid MBRs, which will teach you about Apple's ugly and dangerous hack that's required to boot Windows Vista and earlier on Macs.\n\n*Check OS X forums for discussions of installing Windows in EFI mode on a Mac. This is possible, but difficult, with Windows 7. It's supposedly easier with Windows 8, but the details depend on your Mac model, and unfortunately, I don't have references to sites or forum threads discussing the matter, so I can't be more specific. If you can install Windows 8 in EFI mode, though, you'll obviate the need for the ugly and dangerous hybrid MBR and make the installation both much simpler and much more robust.\n\n*Read up on installing Linux in EFI mode. I wrote a Web page on doing this on Macs that may be helpful, although it's a bit old and uses an ancient Mac as a reference. My more general page on installing Linux on UEFI-based PCs may also be useful.\n\n*With this information in hand, redo your installation. At the very least, re-do the installation of Linux, reserving the hybrid MBR for Windows and booting Linux in EFI mode. Ideally, you'll be able to keep a legal protective MBR and boot all three OSes in EFI mode.\n\n\nYou'll note that these instructions are very general. This is because I'm advising you to learn about your specific computer and your specific needs, which I can't know. Triple-booting on a Mac is best accomplished via significant knowledge, not via a cookie-cutter recipe.\nOh, and your manual rEFInd boot stanza was doomed to failure because such stanzas can launch nothing but EFI programs, and the WUBI loader you're trying to launch is not such a program.\n", "Q: how to get optimal performance from Centrino Advanced-N 6205 wifi card I've just had my home internet upgraded to 50Mb/s down, but I can only get about 25 Mb/s down on my laptop over wifi.

I installed everything just fine and was just getting comfortable with my setup. A few of the games I play were having graphics issues, so I was trying to fix that and in turn, broke everything. \nWhen I boot, after I choose Lubuntu, all I get is a flashing horizontal cursor in the top left of my screen. I can switch to terminal mode via Ctrl + Alt + F1 and work from there, but that's it. This began after I installed a package from the command line (I want to say it was nvidia-331 perhaps?). After rebooting, I uninstalled that package and rebooted again to be greeted with the same sad situation. I tried installing nvidia-current which hasn't changed anything. I also tried installing gnome-shell to see if it was a problem with the lubuntu desktop, but it did not change anything.\nAny suggestions would be gladly welcome.\nSpecs:\nLenovo W510\nNvidia 880M \ni7 Q720\n4GB RAM\nEDIT:\nAs @NikTh suggested, [this page] helped fix my initial issue. I simply ran the following:\nsudo apt-get remove --purge nvidia-*\nsudo apt-get install lubuntu-desktop\nsudo rm /etc/X11/xorg.conf\n\nThis got my display working properly, but now I load into a login screen, though, which I never had before. When I log in, the screen flashes and brings me right back to the same login screen.\nAgain, following @NikTh's suggestion, I ran:\nrm ~/.Xauthority\nsudo service lightdm stop ; sudo service lightdm start\n\nAnd all is well again!\n\nA: This answer might help you to get your DE up and running again. It demonstrates on how you can uninstall the nvidia driver completely (clean up any leftovers..etc) and work with the nouveau driver (open source alternative).   \nAs for the login problem\nTry to remove the file ~/.Xauthority . Login from a TTY (CTRL+ALT+F2) and \nrm ~/.Xauthority . \nBe careful with the dot and the capital X. This file is hidden in your home directory. It is safe to remove it. It will be generated again in next login. After the deletion restart lightdm. \nsudo service lightdm stop ; sudo service lightdm start\n", "Q: How to enter BIOS menu again after uninstalling rEFINd?

I've tried different ways to install iTunes, but to no avail. I tried with Wine, but it didn't work. Is it possible to have iTunes on Ubuntu?\n\nA: *\n\n*Install VirtualBox: https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Linux_Downloads\n\n*Create a Windows VM\n\n*Install iTunes in the running VM: https://www.apple.com/itunes/download/\n\nA: tl;dr:\nTunesviewer: Lightweight, easy-to-use app for university podcast access.\n\nI might be a little bit late, and this solution does not provide all iTunes functionalities but its enough for streaming/downloading podcasts and iTunesU content.\n\nA: You don't need to install the repo to get PlayOnLinux, as the standard repos contain it.

Such as the libimobiledevice-dev. Last time since I tried it, was when I had the Iphone 3. It did work for me then. And the status of their features has only gone greener since then. Development is still on going:\n\n...\n17.10.2014: usbmuxd-1.1.0.tar.bz2 has been officially released.\n...\n\nIphone support:\n\nTested with iPod Touch 1G/2G/3G/4G/5G, iPhone 1G/2G/3G/3GS/4/4S/5/5C/5S/6/6+, iPad 1/2/3/4/Mini/Mini 3/Air/Air 2 and Apple TV 2G/3G running up to firmware 8.1.2 on Linux, Mac OS X and Windows.\n\nInstall it like so:\nsudo apt-get install libimobiledevice-dev\n\nReboot your system and you will be able to do with it whatever you want, using file-managers and Media Players.can read.\nReference:\n\n*\n\n*libimobiledevice - A cross-platform software library and tools to communicate with iOS devices natively\n\n\n*Ubuntu – Details for package libimobiledevice-dev in trusty\n\nA: These solutions are in more detail and have screenshots here:\nhttp://web.archive.org/web/20150511192215/http://www.ubuntuka.com/itunes-ubuntu-linux\nIt is possible to run iTunes using Wine but you may have to download an older version and certain things will not work however these steps should allow you to at least get the program up and running:\n\n\n*\n\n*Go to Ubuntu menu and select \n\nSystem –> Administration –> Synaptic Package Manager\n\nthen type ‘wine’ in quick search and select wine package.\n\n*Hit Ctrl+I to mark it for installation or set a checkbox left to package name (it will also ask to mark several dependency packages).\n\n*Press Apply button or hit Ctrl+P and confirm the installation.\n\n*In a few minutes Ubuntu will download and install wine.\n\n*After a confirmation message that packages were installed close Synaptic Package Manager. From this point wine is installed on your Ubuntu and you can run various windows applications including itunes.\n\n*Download the latest version of iTunes from www.apple.com (today it is iTunes 9.2) or download one of previous versions from www.oldapps.com if the latest one poses problems or just refuses to install under wine emulator (this happens so be prepared for this situation).\n\n*Open folder with downloaded itunes.exe (if you use Firefox as browser it’ll be saved directly to the desktop), select file and enter to file properties (right click –> Properties).\n\n*Save changes and execute the file by double click. Follow itunes installation steps until it shows that installation is successfully finished.\n\n*Once installation is finished you will be able to start itunes by clicking corresponding shortcut on Ubuntu desktop or running the following command in terminal (go to Ubuntu menu and select System –> Accessories –> Terminal):\nwine ~/.wine/dosdevices/c\\:/Program Files/iTunes/iTunes.exe\n\nThe second and less popular way of getting iTunes running is by using a Virtualbox, and this way all of the features are available.  To do so follow the steps provided here:\n\n\n*\n\n*Go to www.virtualbox.org and download the latest version of Virtualbox binary deb package for Ubuntu.\n\n*Open downloaded package with GDebi Package Installer — it comes with Ubuntu by default and is associated with .deb files from the beginning so just double click Virtualbox deb package.\n\n*Press ‘Install Package’ button and follow easy instructions to get Virtualbox package installed. Once finished you will get ‘Oracle VM Virtualbox’ item in Applications –> System Tools menu.\n\n*Open \n\nApplications –> System Tools –> Oracle VM Virtualbox \n\nand press button ‘New’ to create virtual machine, and prepare virtual machine for Windows XP (you can also use other versions of Windows) operating system that will be used to run iTunes.  You may need to look into Virtualbox's documents on setting up a virtual machine as they can be kinda tricky sometimes.\n\n*Insert your preferred version of Windows media (disc, iso, or usb and I personally currently recommend Windows 7) and press ‘Start’ button to boot virtual machine. Install a copy of Windows to virtual machine and logon to the Windows desktop.\n\n*In Windows inside virtual machine go to apple.com, download and install the latest version of iTunes. Once finished you will get workable itunes with all those terrific features it supports.\nAnother way to keep iTunes in your life is dual-booting Windows and Ubuntu. \nAnd these are some alternatives to iTunes that work great in Ubuntu\n\n\n*\n\n*Rhythmbox — this one comes with Ubuntu by default so it’s even not necessary to install it, just go to \n\nApplications –> Sound and Video –> Rhythmbox Music Player.\n\nIt provides powerful and easy music browser, can sort/search music of almost all known formats including streaming audio, can play and rip CDs and DVDs. One of the most important features of Rhythmbox is iPod support meaning e.g. I can connect my favourite ipod classic 160GB and transfer music to it without itunes at all. Developers say that Rhythmbox was inspired by Apple’s itunes. I believe them.\n\n*Amarok — music player and manager with impressive list of features.\nCurrently this is the most powerful music engine available for Ubuntu and Linux on the whole. Amarok makes it possible to transfer files to iPod and other mp3 players, to buy legal music from Magnatune (www.Magnatune.com) store, to create dynamic playlists, to import itunes music database and much-much more. Amarok was designed for KDE (while Ubuntu runs Gnome) desktop manager so it requires a lot of dependencies when you install it — be prepared to download 200 MB of staff to get Amarok installed.\n\n*Banshee — is open source media player supported by Novel. It brings a lot of useful features to user starting from ability to manage music library and media art and ending with full support of video and podcasts. Banshee is one of the most pretty-looking application of this list, it took a lot of features from itunes and can also sync ipod and other media devices with your music and video library. I’m using Banshee for several years and still believe this is the best itunes-like music player for Ubuntu.\n\n*Exaile — is very fast and easy-to-use music player for Gnome window manager. Currently it is on its early stage of development and didn’t reach 1.0 version but brings very powerful list of features like album art management, lyrics fetching or ipod device support. Exaile was designed as an alternative to Amarok and iTunes so you will find many features from them.\nBuy legal music in Ubuntu without itunes\nThere are two major alternatives to iTunes Music Store in Ubuntu which can be used in the same way — Jamendo, Magnatune. Ubuntu applications Rhythmbox, Banshee, Amarok and Exaile supports mentioned music stores and make it possible to navigate the music store and buy the music as easily as in itunes music store. Also there are a lot of music stores like Amazon which makes it possible to preview and buy music using any browser like Firefox, Opera or Chromimum which are supported by Ubuntu.\n\nA: MIGRATE YOUR ITUNE FOLDER instead of installing iTunes on Ubuntu. Use banshee instead. Just wanted to post a follow up to what I said above:\nPlease note that I just tested this and it works\nCopy your iTunes folder from it's location in Windows (under My Music) to an external HDD or USB Thumb drive.\nAfter you have Ubuntu installed you need to install Banshee because 12.04 comes with Rhythm Box by default. In my case I also installed ALL of the (install banshee from the software center first) and then install all the Banshee add-on's listed under Banshee in the Ubuntu Software Center. You also should install (from the Software Center) the Ubuntu Restricted Codecs (it's called UBUNTU RESTRICTED EXTRAS).\nOK after all that is done go ahead and fire up Banshee and select (from the top) EDIT then under that select PREFERENCES\nCheckmark the option called, \"Copy Files to media folders when importing\". The only other thing I checkmarked on this page was the \"Update file and folder names\" (everything else is optional)\nAfter you do that select (from the top) MEDIA then under that select IMPORT MEDIA\nNow change the selection to read, \"iTunes Media Player\"\nIt will now let you browse to your iTunes folder and select the XML file. The file is under the iTunes folder (it's easy to find). Select it and click \"open\" and then \"import\"\nBanshee will now add the iTunes songs to itself BUT (and this is the important part) it will also copy all your music to your Ubuntu MUSIC folder.\nAfter it is done your music is in your Ubuntu MUSIC folder and you can continue to use Banshee or use Rhythm Box or any other Linux based music player.\nHope this helps! \n\nA: Work-around (Ubuntu 16.04 at time of writing): Use built-in RDP (Remmina) with audio enabled.

Just a simple question. I want to install a deb package and which should I select - 32bit or 64bit package? My ubuntu is 64bit version, but recently I read for some programs they advice to install 32bit packages, so now I am confused.\n\nA: Let's say Mozilla only makes Firefox available as 32-bit software - if you are using a 64-bit version of Adobe Flash Player, it will be incompatible with Firefox because 64-bit software is only compatible with 64-bit software (32-bit software is compatible with both)...\nBut if you had both the 32-bit and 64-bit version of Flash Player installed, you'd have the 32-bit version for Firefox (in addition to any other Flash-enabled/powered 32-bit software), and the 64-bit version for any 64-bit, Flash-enabled/powered software you are running.\nAs a rule-of-thumb, you should always try to get a hold of 64-bit software where possible as it offers better security, more stability and in most cases, better performance (the Ubuntu Software Center will usually try to install 64-bit versions of software, where available, if your computer is already configured as a 64-bit system)... Which in part is tied to the higher memory (RAM) allowances supported by 64-bit software.\nIt's when you start talking about extensions/plug-ins/etc that 32-bit software might be the way to go... But often these are available in 32-bit and 64-bit varieties, so just install both if you use a combination of 32-bit and 64-bit software (or just stick to 64-bit software!).\nBy the way, it is the 64-bit version of Firefox that installed by default under a 64-bit Ubuntu operating system...

In my ubuntu 12.04 system, I faced this problem many times that my mouse pointer get stuck to its position, doesn't move anywhere, all other things works fine except the pointer and I had to restart my system to fix this. How can I fix this so that next time I don't have to restart my system?\n\nA: As per the comments in the question: this is the explanation:\nWhen a lot of apps are opened, they would require more memory than the physical RAM of the system. This would prompt the system to use the swap partition, and write the \"unrequired\" data out on the swap (on disk). Now, if a lot of, or most of the apps are active, then the unrequired memory is very low, and in reality, the system keeps writing stuff to swap, takes it out and writes something else, and take it out again, and writes something else on swap. This would go on, and no real processing would happen. This situation would be indicated by a lot of disk activity (observable through iotop, or the constantly on LED for disk on the laptop).\nThe remedy for this is to get bigger RAM if you really want to use so many apps in general. Otherwise just be aware that hardware has some limitations and open just lesser number of apps in the system simultaneously.\nIf you must use so many apps at once, then try a lightweight ubuntu edition like Lubuntu or Xubuntu.\nThis answer is open ended, with a possibility of a google search for \"techniques to reduce memory consumption of ubuntu\".\n\nA: I found that answer given here https://askubuntu.com/a/184852/239257 works for me.\nStep 1.

For example:\nwget \"http://pastebin.com/raw.php?i=p3bkbAMu\" -O vmnet313.patch\n\nNext, execute following commands:\n# Change directory into the vmware module source directory\ncd /usr/lib/vmware/modules/source\n# untar the vmnet modules\ntar -xvf vmnet.tar\n# run a the patch you should have just saved earlier\npatch vmnet-only/filter.c < ~/vmnet313.patch\n# re-tar the modules\ntar -uvf vmnet.tar vmnet-only\n# delete the previous working directory\nrm -r vmnet-only\n# run the vmware module build program.

I am using Ubuntu 14, so I went on a quest and found the solution here.\nThe commands are the following:\nsudo apt-get install build-essential linux-headers-`uname -r`\n\nUnder a 32-bit system, you can install VMware Player with the following commands:\nmkdir ~/VMware && cd ~/VMware \nwget -c http://goo.gl/kkfRJg -O VMware-Player-i386.bundle.tar \ntar -xvf VMware-Player-i386.bundle.tar \nchmod +x VMware-Player-6.0.1-1379776.i386.bundle  \nsudo sh VMware-Player-6.0.1-1379776.i386.bundle\nmkdir ~/VMware && cd ~/VMware \nwget -c http://goo.gl/Uxia2s -O VMware-Player-x86_64.bundle.tar \ntar -xvf VMware-Player-x86_64.bundle.tar \nchmod +x VMware-Player-6.0.1-1379776.x86_64.bundle \nsudo sh VMware-Player-6.0.1-1379776.x86_64.bundle\n\nAfter the install, everything worked well and I was able to mount a Windows XP VM with minimal problems. I had to update a few more drivers, but it did without no problems.

In addition to this gksu and gksudo don't work for starting graphical applications as root in Wayland in Ubuntu 17.10: Why don't gksu/gksudo work with Wayland? and the gksu package has been dropped from the default Ubuntu repositories in Ubuntu 18.04 and later. \nNautilus Admin (nautilus-admin) is a simple Python extension for the Nautilus file manager that adds some administrative actions to the right-click menu:\n\n\n*\n\n*Open as Administrator: opens a folder in a new Nautilus window running with administrator (root) privileges.  \n\n*Edit as Administrator: opens a file in a Gedit window running with administrator (root) privileges.\n\n\nTo install Nautilus Admin in all  currently supported versions of Ubuntu open the terminal and type:\nsudo apt install nautilus-admin  \n\nWhile there are commands to run graphical applications as root, you are strongly advised to use nano text editor, which normally is run from the terminal, for editing files as root. Nano text editor is included in the default Ubuntu installation.\nNano is very easy to use. The instructions for using nano editor are always found at the bottom of every page. The only two nano keyboard shortcuts that you need to know are for WriteOut and Exit. Press the keyboard combination Ctrl+O and after that press Enter to save the file being edited. Press the keyboard combination Ctrl+X to exit nano.\nIf you get into the habit of editing files as root the right way, you will reduce the possibility of making mistakes that may be very time consuming to correct.\n\nA: I am trying to summarize all info in the other answers on this page:\nWayland:\n\n\n*\n\n*Why don't gksu/gksudo or launching a graphical application with sudo work with Wayland?\nThe only option looks to used nano or vi/vim\nXorg:\ntry this \nsudo -H env DISPLAY=:0 gedit\n\nif it works it probably means you need to add some option to sudo configuration files\nsudo visudo\n\nTry to add this line at the end\nDefaults env_keep=\"XAUTHORIZATION XAUTHORITY TZ PS2 PS1 PATH LS_COLORS KRB5CCNAME HOSTNAME HOME DISPLAY COLORS\"`\n\n\nA: I just had similar problem. \nI'm using Debian Jessie and to start gedit as root this line was then finally working: \nsudo -H gedit\n\n", "Q: Remove packages Ubuntu 12.04 I'm doing a bit of cleaning on my Ubuntu 12.04 LTS.\nI've noted that when I install a package (via apt-get install packageName), the depends and recommends packages linked at this package are also installed.\nI'm wondering if it's possible remove the recommends packages without any problem/ lose stability?\nInstead, as for the depends packages, I think that's no possible. Right?\nThanks.\nStefano\n\nA: It would quickly become a mess if that was not possible.\nIf you remove a package and other packages depend on it the system will remove those if you agree to it. Deleting a library that is in use by Unity will remove Unity BUT as long as you do not remove apt-get itself you can always re-install it with apt-get. \nThere is an extra package called deporphan that scans the system for libs that are no longer in use by any packages and that will remove those when you agree to it.

I try to run project (qml and c++) but I get pop up window with message \"Could not find the executable\" and some settings (command, arguments, working directory)\nHow should I run it?\n\n\nA: If you have a C++ program with a QML interface, Command is the name of the executable produced by compilation and Arguments is whatever arguments you want to pass it.\nIf you have a QML program with C++ plugins, Command is qmlscene and Arguments is what you would add to qmlscene to run your QML program.  As a minimum, you probably want something like -I . main.qml.  The -I . tells qmlscene to look for plugins in the current directory, and main.qml should be changed to whatever the name of your main QML file is.\n", "Q: How do I give myself fast access to pasting some common strings? I often find myself pasting the same strings into the browser (I have a youtube channel, and at the end of the videos I constantly post the same links: channel URL, website, email, introductory video, etc).\nI thought about creating a text file and then adding it to the Unity panel, but unfortunately while I see the way to add the text editor to it, I can't add the text file to be opened with the text editor. I could probably put a script together and add that to the panel, but then it struck me that other people probably had the same time wasting experience, and probably have already found the solution.\nIn the perfect world I need an application that stores commonly needed strings, when loaded it would right away start on top of other windows and stay as such, it would have buttons for different strings, and they would be placed into the buffer as soon as pressed. This way I would just assign that which I need to those buttons and be very very happy.\nIf no good solution exists, I will just have to create it myself, I guess. After all my channel is about programming, and I can probably make a wonderful lesson just out of creating such a tool.\n\nA: You can install autokey with  sudo apt-get install autokey-gtk for the GTK+ version or sudo apt-get install autokey-qt for the Qt version.\nautokey allows you to define abbreviations which when typed in anywhere in your xsession will expand to a defined phrase: E.g I defined an abbreviation xyy for the phrase Thank you for your help. I ticked in the Always prompt before pasting this phrase option in the autokey configuration. From now on, anywhere I type xyy and hit a space, a small pop-up appears, which I can select with a down-arrow key and an ENTER and the typed xyy is replaced with the phrase Thank you for your help.\nIf you don't tick in the \"prompt before pasting\" option then the abbreviation is replaced immediately after you hit space. You can also define scripts, like for inserting the current date.\nI use autokey-gtk on 12.04 which has a minor problem that the autokey tray icon doesn't show up on the panel. To correct this just launch dconf-editor and add 'Autokey' to the Desktop->Unity->Panel->systray-whitelist array. E.g. for me it contained ['JavaEmbeddedFrame', 'Wine', 'Update-notifier'] and I modified it to ['JavaEmbeddedFrame', 'Wine', 'Update-notifier', 'Autokey']. If you are using Unity2D then this won't solve the problem because of a bug in Unity2D. For Unity2D you have to change the array to ['all'] to whitelist every app. After these modifications log-out/log-in and the tray icon should be visible now.\nDon't forget to set autokey to start up on login, on the Edit->Preferences->General\n tab.\n\nA: Personally I've found ClipIt to cover all my copy/paste needs. \nsudo apt-get install clipit\n\nWith it's hotkey combinations you can pretty much get to any paste item super quickly. I have set Ctrl+Alt+H to \"manage history\" which allows me to instantly launch a floating window, type a search for the item I want to paste and paste it directly into whatever window I'm in (make sure \"Automatically paste selected item\" is checked in Preferences > Settings).\nThere's also the fast access \"Manage hotkey\" which shows you a list of the most recent 20 clips for quick access. If the items you're pasting are used commonly they'll be in your history.\nIf you're not pasting them that commonly you could use ClipIt's \"Actions\" feature to place items into the clipboard quickly.\nFor example, in actions you could add:\nAction: test\nCommand: clipit \"this is a test line to be pasted\"\n\nYou can then run the actions hotkey (default ctrl+alt+a), select your command title, and then ctrl+v to paste.\nWorks pretty sweetly. Sadly I haven't worked out how to make the action auto-paste into the current window. I tried piping to xclip -o but that doesn't work.\n\nA: This can be done by creating a custom launcher for GEdit to open your text file\n\n\n*\n\n*Install gnome-panel.

The problem I am facing is that when I switch workspaces (ie. using Ctrl-Alt-arrow combination), all windows being currently open on given workspace simply loose focus, actually nothing is focused at the time. I then need to either click on a window or flick with alt-tab to get desired window to gain focus again.\nExample:\n\n*\n\n*Google Chrome window on workspace 1 has focus\n\n*switch to workspace 2 (ctrl+alt+down)\n\n*switch back to workspace 1 (ctrl+alt+up)\n\n*no window has focus on workspace 1, need to click it or press alt-tab to focus the window\n\nExpected behaviour:\nThe last focused window on given workspace should re-gain focus as soon as I switch back to that workspace.\nThe \"Focus mode\" setting in Tweak Tool is set to \"Click\", however I don't recall having such problem before, ie. with earlier versions of gnome-shell. Changing mode to \"Sloppy\" or \"Mouse\" is not an option, as I don't like the idea of mouse cursor driving focus.

I installed UbuntuGnome, and to my utmost surprise the battery life on a fresh vanilla installation, was about 8-10 hours which is even better than Windoze 7! It's a shame that Unity is the culprit here.\nI'm running Ubuntu 13.10 on a Thinkpad T530 machine. (Core i7, 9-cell battery, 16GB RAM, nVidia + Intel VGA, 15\" LCD, ...). Since I don't play games, I have disabled the nVidia card from BIOS so practically the system has only one VGA card, the Intel one.\nI have installed and enabled laptop-mode-tools. When running on battery, the battery provides about 3 hours of charge. The same machine, running Windoze 7, had about 7-10 hours of battery life.\nI understand that comparing battery consumption on Windoze and Linux doesn't make sense as it is deeply dependent on the quality of the drivers available on either operating system.

As you can see the battery is discharging at ~24W/h which is outrageous.\nHow can I improve the situation here? What is the main culprit behind this awful discharge rate? I can't understand the logic that how powertop is reporting that value. I have read a ton of post regarding power consumption but to no avail. \nTIA,\n\nA: EDITED OUT THIS LINK TO DEBIAN FORUMS BECAUSE I DONT HAVE ENOUGH \"REP\"\nhttps://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Lenovo_ThinkPad_T530\nI wrote the battery section of the Arch wiki, and you can see my response at the end of the debian thread above. The biggest problem with Ubuntu I suspect is that it runs a lot of processes straight from boot, many of which you dont need. Also, laptop-mode-tools is not just an install and its done type of deal- you will have to go through its options with a fine-tooth comb. Something I neglected to mention in either place is to create the file:\n/etc/modprobe.d/intel.conf\nand place the following in it:\noptions i915 i915_enable_rc6=7 i915_enable_fbc=1 lvds_downclock=1\nThat one dropped my idle usage watts below whats listed in the Arch wiki. With the latest kernel in the Arch world (3.13.4-1-ARCH), my T530 (specced similar to yours) is using about 6.4-6.6 watts idle. Windows used 8 watts after I installed a bare install (using a bare windows 7 cd from microsoft using my cd key- legal), and set it up exclusively for battery life. Fedora was higher, and I havent set Debian up for mobile use.\nMy Arch install at least lasts noticeably longer than windows off the AC (by at least an hour if used; more if a lot of idle time). So that is to say, dont lose the faith! The T530 is actually great driver wise EXCEPT the ethernet card (no powersavings). Also, Unity if Im correct uses compositing by default- GPU use even on an intel card will kill battery life. FWIW, I have windows set up to not use the GPU and its still more power hungry. Good luck..\nEDIT In your case, it is definitely Unity that is killing your battery. And heres the big problem- there isnt really anything you can do about it if you keep Unity. Notice the compiz process? Thats what Unity uses as a compositor now. Thats ~50 wakeups from deep sleep, plus an additional ~25 wakeups for Unity's panel. The biggest cost however is the GPU wakeups- 6 (!) per second. To offer a comparison, check out this screenshot:\nhttp://tinypic.com/view.php?pic=ru7g4g&s=8\nThis is the canonical example of how Ubuntu has taken a turn for the worse (pun intended). Between integrated spyware and an interface that is sparse yet resource intensive, it is not what it used to be. Take this from someone who started on Ubuntu 6.10 and became very active in the community. Im no expert, but you are seeing now what many of us (former) members have grown weary of.\nSo what can you do? Well, you dont have to ditch Unity entirely if you dont want. You DO have to ditch it when using the battery though. My screeny above isnt the only way; you could install Openbox and a panel application like I have (xfce4-panel), Fluxbox (which has its own toolbar and window tabbing), or maybe even PekWM which many like. You would then select your option at the login screen- this gives you basically a \"battery\" choice and a \"on power\" choice (Unity). \nAlternatively, have you considered Xubuntu? You can disable compositing on Xubuntu, and it is MUCH lighter on memory, CPU usage, and GPU usage (with compositing disabled). Even Kubuntu would likely save you juice if you told Kwin (window manager of KDE, the desktop environment of Kubuntu) to disable compositing. The plus of this is, Kwin is currently the most feature-stuffed window manager that exists, so you could certainly have flash and function.\nIts up to you. Unfortunately, what used to be a moderately severe \"bug\" is now a \"feature\"; Ubuntu is just not power efficient at all anymore. You either keep Unity and never have good battery life, or ditch Unity in favor of something more power conscious. \n", "Q: Cannot mount iPod touch to Ubuntu due to Lockdown errors I sit before you with the common question of how to sync an iPod 5G or any iDevice to Ubuntu 13.10.

In it's current state it types characters randomly. I am using an external keyboard, and would like to avoid problems logging in\nI searched and found some solutions, like scripts - but I need one that works before the login screen.\n\nA: Well, I could suggest a hardware-based solution. You could look up the laptop's manual, open it (screwdrivers, etc.), find the connector that links the in-built keyboard and the laptop's motherboard (on my HP dv3 this was relatively easy), and unplug it. Then you won't have any more inadvertent key presses. While you're at it, you could take out the keyboard and see if it's possible to clean it up to make it behave.\nAs for a software-based solution, you can put xinput set-int-prop 14 \"Device Enabled\" 8 0 (as per your current workaround) in /etc/rc.local.

I have been trying to install Matlab on Ubuntu.\nThe issue starts even prior to the installation, as mounting the .iso file results in the following error:\nmount: block device /home/marta/Downloads/R2013a_UNIX.iso is write-protected, mounting read-only\n\nWhen typing blkid I get:\n/dev/loop1: LABEL=\"MATHWORKS_R2013A\" TYPE=\"iso9660\" \n/dev/sda1: UUID=\"CB61-A2F3\" TYPE=\"vfat\" \n/dev/sda2: UUID=\"3a6abc2f-f83c-4c52-84f9-f10cbae59ada\" TYPE=\"ext4\" \n/dev/sda3: UUID=\"27362882-2d21-47ea-a65a-27102e6dea1e\" TYPE=\"swap\" \n\nSo it is there, but all as read-only and hence I can't use it. How do I resolve the issue?\n\nA: ISO 9660 is a read-only file system, because it was designed for read-only media (CD-ROMs). This shouldn't pose a problem for installation though, because during installation the installation medium is only read and not written to.\nMount the image read-only to a folder (e.g. /mnt), open a terminal and change the working directory to that folder, then start the installation program.

After much searching and reading I have been able to connect my Toshiba C665-S5177 to the internet.  To do so I had to install the Realtek drivers for wireless card rtl8192ce from the Realtek website.  \nThe method of installation followed the ReadMe file include with the driver...\nmake clean    \nsudo su    \nmake    \nmake install    \nreboot\n\nHowever, my internet connection is very slow and is continuously dropping and reconnecting.\nAdvice from some previous posts suggested running the wireless info script.  The results from the script are linked here.\nThe script was run while attached to the internet via ethernet, which works well.  If you would like me to run the script again while connected to wireless I can do that.\n\nA: Late answer but hopefully helps some people...\nI have a Thinkpad x121e which uses this driver (rtl8192ce) and when I installed Ubuntu 14.04 I kept having WiFi disconnects, about every 15 minutes.\nFrom a post on the Arch Boards I found a fix. The problem is apparently with powersaving features of the driver, specifically ips (link power save) and fwlps (presumably firmware power save). These are enabled by default.\nThe fix is to create a file /etc/modprobe.d/rtl8192ce.conf and add this text to it:\noptions rtl8192ce ips=0 fwlps=0\n\nYou will need to be root to do this. Then reboot and hopefully you'll have a stable WiFi connection. (Incidentally I'm using a newer kernel from kernel.org but I don't think that is relevant/important to this fix).\n\nA: Have you tried the fix that corrected this issue with the same card?\nRealtek RTL8188CE desconects randomly and features slow connections\n\nA: I have a lenovo T430s with drivers rtl8192ce running ubuntu 14.04(lts). Had same exact issues. Pinging a local server on the LAN would return 50ms and every 10 seconds or so it would jump to 1200 even 2000. Every 10 minutes or so, it would just disconnect. \nthe solution was as suggested by Clockworkz\ncreate /etc/modprobe.d/rtl8192ce.conf and add options rtl8192ce ips=0 fwlps=0 then reboot.\nNow pings to same machine are below 10ms. \n", "Q: How can I as a root user manage folder owned by other users using ubuntu desktop?

I choose my options, then click on \"Format\". \nAnd then, nothing appends... My USB drive is not formatted, and I don't have anything asking for my password. \nI looked around, and found this thread, which is not helping, since the \"Format\" option on right-click does not appear with nautilus started as super-user. \nAny thoughts ? \nPlease note that I'm not trying to format my USB-stick, I'm trying to format it with the built-in nautilus action. \nEDIT : \nThe \"Format\" option in context menu is provided by gnome-disks. Gnome-disks can't format my drive either. So far, I've found using it one error Error synchronizing after initial wipe: Timed out waiting for object (udisks-error-quark, 0)\n\nA: Ok well, I found it. But it's messy...\nMy error was caused by util-linux(in buggy version 2.20 since 2012), which is needed by udisks, which is the package used by gnome-disks to format USB drives, which is the tool used by the \"Format\" option in the Nautilus context-menu. \nThe bug is reported here and here.

I have not run into any issues thus far and all seems to be working well, but will this give me issues with upgrading later on?\n\nA: Since Trusty immediately follows Saucy, you should not have any problems upgrading if you upgrade to trusty (first). Even if you want to upgrade to the u-series, do not skip the upgrade step to Trusty, to get your system fully “in sync” again.\nBut yes, running “mixed distributions” is what people are doing all the time.\nIn Debian, running a mixed stable/oldstable or stable/testing or stable/testing/unstable or stable/unstable system is supported, but not mixing oldstable with testing for example (skipping one distribution).\nIn Ubuntu, mixing distributions is normally supported either version X and X+1, or version X=LTS and X+4=LTS+1, since you are allowed to directly upgrade from one LTS to the next one. (On the other hand, since there are 4 full Ubuntu releases between LTS releases, mixing packages like that will be much less likely to succeed due to updated dependencies (libraries, for example) and whole-system changes).\nIt is much safer to install packages from an older version on a newer system, than to install select packages from a newer version on an older system. Generally, one uses backports (either official or PPA) for that.\n", "Q: How to figure out why FTP isn't working? I tried setting up a FTP Server on my Netbook, but I cannot connect to it.

I'm guessing that it might be because of the FTP connection mode. There are two connection modes on FTP: Active Mode and Passive Mode. \nHere's a brief explanation of this two modes:\nActive Mode: \n1. Client connects to port 21 of server (Command Channel)\n2. Server connects FROM port 20 to a port specified by the client (DATA)\nPassive Mode: \n1. Client connects to port 21 of server (Command Channel)\n2. Client connects from random port to a port specified by the server (DATA)\n\nBy default, FTP client applications use Passive Mode because it is more \n\"secure\". So, with this mode, the port forwarding of port 20 (DATA CHANNEL) is obsolete because the external client (Internet) is trying to connect to another port for the Data Channel. So, you'll need to switch to the Active Mode so that the Data Channel connection is done by the server (who uses the port 20 to send) rather than the client.\nAs the following picture shows, in FileZilla client, you can switch to Active Mode:\n\nThe ftp command uses by default the Passive Mode as well. To force it into Active Mode, you'll need to do the following:\nftp [YOUR_FTP_SERVER_IP]\npassive\n\nBy doing so, the passive flag will be set to false and the Data Channel will use the Active Mode (if you do it again, it'll set it back to true).\n(Sources: https://www.tutorialspoint.com/unix_commands/pftp.htm https://serverfault.com/questions/152245/how-to-disable-passive-mode-in-linux-ftp-command)\nI hope my explanations weren't too confusing...\n", "Q: Change Custom Theme's Desktop Label I'm attempting to write a custom theme for 12.04 and would like to change the upper left-hand corner label for the desktop from \"Ubuntu Desktop\" to a simple icon.

My Ubuntu laptop died recently and I've pulled the hard drive out of it. I'm trying to read the data on it from a windows 8.1 laptop but I don't think its recognizing the file system.\nI've tried installing an ubuntu virtualbox VM but it's unable to detect the hard drive.\nI'm currently unable to dual boot due to lack of blank CD's... is there a way to read the hard drive using Windows 8.1?\n\nA: Windows only naturally understands Windows file systems... but you can install more.\nUbuntu by default uses ext4 these days, so you probably need something like this :\nhttp://www.ext2fsd.com/\n\nA: It appears that the ext2fsd solution has not been updated in over 2 years, and has outstanding known bugs that indicate they create data corruption, so I would be cautious about that approach.\nI think you would be be better off accessing the filesystem from a native OS. I would suggest that you prepare a bootable image of the Ubuntu desktop installer ISO for the version you have/had installed on the dead PC, and use that to boot your Windows 8 PC.\n\n*\n\n*On the Windows 8 machine, download the appropriate image from Ubuntu.\n\n*On the Windows 8 machine, either burn the image to a CD/DVD, or make a bootable image on a USB/flash device (I prefer the PenDrive Rufus tool on Windows).\n\n*Power down the Windows 8 machine and attach the dead Ubuntu machine's disk via SATA (before power up) or USB (before or after).\n\n*Insert the Ubuntu CD/DVD/USB/flashdrive in the Windows 8 machine.\n\n*Power up the Windows 8 machine; when it starts, be sure to configure the BIOS to boot from CD/DVD or \"removable device\" (USB/Flash) before the local HDD, or choose it from the boot-time BIOS selection.\n\n*At the Ubuntu Live Welcome screen, select \"Try Ubuntu\", not \"Install Ubuntu\", and allow the system to load.\n\n*Look for dead system's disk on the Live Ubuntu's desktop/Nautilus/mount list.\n\n*Navigate to the files on the old linux drive that you want to recover, and copy them to a partition on the Windows 8 machine, a USB/flash device, or network storage.\n\n*Shutdown the Live Ubuntu image and remove the Ubuntu CD/DVD/USB/flash device from the Windows system.\n\n*Restart the Windows machine under Windows 8 and access the files from the location you copied them to.\n\n\nA: Yep. Get a driver to read it like http://sourceforge.net/projects/ext2fsd/\nI havent used linux forever so google one for whatever filesystem you use.\n\nA: Yes, by far the best solution, with support for ext4, google then install Paragon ExtFS. It will alow native access on Mac or all current Windows. \n\nA: (someone correct me if i am wrong) but you should ba able to boot from the ubuntu hard drive in your laptop by swiching them out since linux dosnt have licensing like windows, then all you have to do is copy the files to a flash drive or to your windows hard drive with a sata to usb adapter \n", "Q: make file error, trying to install intel power gadget I hope another Ubuntu user has tried to run Intel power gadget and knows what problem I am having.\nI am trying to install the power gadget, running the make file i get an error message: \n/usr/lib/power_gadget/rapl.c:516: undefined reference to `log'\n\nThis line refers to the line in a .c file:\nreturn (log((double)(time / RAPL_TIME_UNIT)) - A_LNF[F]) / LN2;\n\nIs this log function being called correctly?\nAm I missing a dependency on my Ubuntu setup?\nIs there perhaps a missing library file in my download?\nThanks in advance for any help\nRegards\nRoz\nEdit, the make file is below:\nCFLAGS=-g\n\nall: rapl_lib_shared rapl_lib_static power_gadget_static\n\nrapl_lib_shared: \n    gcc $(CFLAGS) -fpic -c msr.c cpuid.c rapl.c \n    gcc $(CFLAGS) -shared -o librapl.so msr.o cpuid.o rapl.o\n\nrapl_lib_static: \n    gcc $(CFLAGS) -c msr.c cpuid.c rapl.c \n    ar rcs librapl.a msr.o cpuid.o rapl.o\n\npower_gadget_static: \n    gcc $(CFLAGS) power_gadget.c -I. -L. -lm -o power_gadget ./librapl.a\n\npower_gadget: \n    gcc $(CFLAGS) power_gadget.c -I. -L. -lm -lrapl -o power_gadget \n\ngprof: CFLAGS = -pg\ngprof: all\n    ./power_gadget -e 100 -d 60 >/dev/null 2>&1\n    gprof power_gadget > power_gadget.gprof\n    rm -f gmon.out\n    make clean\n\nclean: \n    rm -f power_gadget librapl.so librapl.a msr.o cpuid.o rapl.o \n\n\nA: I got the same problem and managed to solve it by simply change the -lm flag to the end off the GCC command.\nSo the Makefile now looks like this:\nCFLAGS=-g\n\nall: rapl_lib_shared rapl_lib_static power_gadget_static\n\nrapl_lib_shared: \ngcc $(CFLAGS) -fpic -c msr.c cpuid.c rapl.c\ngcc $(CFLAGS) -shared -o librapl.so msr.o cpuid.o rapl.o\n\nrapl_lib_static:\ngcc $(CFLAGS) -c msr.c cpuid.c rapl.c\nar rcs librapl.a msr.o cpuid.o rapl.o\n\npower_gadget_static: \ngcc $(CFLAGS) power_gadget.c -I. -L. -o power_gadget ./librapl.a -lm\n\npower_gadget:\ngcc $(CFLAGS) power_gadget.c -I. -L. -lrapl -o power_gadget -lm\n\ngprof: CFLAGS = -pg\ngprof: all\n./power_gadget -e 100 -d 60 >/dev/null 2>&1\ngprof power_gadget > power_gadget.gprof\nrm -f gmon.out\nmake clean\n\nclean:\nrm -f power_gadget librapl.so librapl.a msr.o cpuid.o rapl.o\n\n", "Q: Remove arrows on system tray menus in gnome I've recently upgraded to Ubuntu 13.10 with Gnome and have found the behaviour of the context menus on icons in the system tray behaves differently.\nFor applets which normally have a large number of menu options (e.g. notes in Tomboy or files in Dropbox) rather than display all the menu icons now only 5 or 6 are displayed and up/down arrows are displayed to scroll to the rest.\nIs it possible to revert this behaviour so all menu options are showing without the need to scroll?\n\nA: This extension/work around could be of some help if you have to get rid of the drop down menus which are default in gnome 3.8+ gnome-shell-remove-dropdown-arrows \n\nA: There's this awesome extension called TopiconsPlus.

Why bash process the apostrophes like this?\n\nA: Apostrophes are special character for almost all shells (shell is the term that refers to command line interpreters, which is the program that reads what you type and co the appropriate thing). \nShort answer : don't do that. As the case for spaces, better avoid filenames with special meaning or special chars in them. \nLong answer: if you want to use apostrophes, you have to \"quote\" them (using special characters that stop the shell from interpreting them). Autocompletion will quote them automatically when needed... Example:\n(0)samsung-romano:~/tmp/try% touch \"hard'n'soft\"\n\nOne way of quoting single quotes is with double quotes. (And viceversa, although is more complex than this). \n(0)samsung-romano:~/tmp/try% ls\nhard'n'soft\n\nNow if it write cat hard and press TAB:\n(0)samsung-romano:~/tmp/try% cat hard\\'n\\'soft \n\nBackslashes are another form of quoting the following character.\n\nA: Well, as bash_completion team advised, I have reported this behaviour to bash team and their answer is:\n\"Thanks for the report.  This will be fixed in bash-4.3.\"\nlooks like the bug is already known and we should just wait.\n\nA: In order to expand a path with apostrophes in it, add an \" in front of the path.\n\ncd \"/home/mallniya/hard\n\nexpands without problems in tab-expansion.\n", "Q: How to uninstall rubymine from UBUNTU I was trying to upgrade from RubyMine 5.4.3.2.1 to 6 for that I was trying to uninstall RubyMine 5.4.3.2.1.

The problem I have encountered is that the machine does not have PAE so all releases of Ubuntu Server that I have tried will not work with the computer. The computer is pretty unimpressive with the following stats:\nDell Inspiron 700m\nProcessor: Intel Pentium-M 735 1.7GHz\nRAM: 512MB\nHDD: 40GB \nGraphics: Intel Graphics Media Accelerator 900\nSo is there anyway to get Ubuntu Server on this device? If so, how?\n\nA: I have an IBM Thinkpad T42 with the same or very similar Pentium M processor running at 1.7 GHz. This processor is actually capable of PAE, but does not announce it, so you can use fakepae or forcepae and a PAE version of light-weight flavours of Ubuntu will work.\nYou can add the boot option forcepae with the current 32-bit linux kernels i386, that are used in the Ubuntu family, for example Lubuntu and Ubuntu mini.iso until 18.10 (the newest release, when this is written). Both work in my old Thinkpad and should work in your computer too.\nI suggest that you use the Ubuntu mini.iso version 18.04.1 LTS, with long time support for 5 years, in order to install your Ubuntu Server.\nThe mini.iso is also called Netboot.\n\n\n*\n\n*The iso file is very small, and it requires a wired network to connect to the internet and the Ubuntu web servers to download and install most of the program packages\n\n*The installer is the old style text mode 'Debian' installer\n\n*There is a menu, where you can select what to install. You can install anything from\n\n\n*\n\n*the most basic text mode linux system, to\n\n*Ubuntu Server\n\n*Kubuntu (too heavy for an old Pentium M processor)\n\n*Lubuntu\n\n*...\n\n*standard Ubuntu (too heavy for an old Pentium M processor)\n\n*...\n\n*Xubuntu\n\n\n*If you install the most basic text mode linux system, you can install your Ubuntu Server later, when you have logged into the basic text mode linux system, and later on the extra features that you want, but I think the menu in the installer makes things easier.\nSee also these links and links from them,\nBoot options\nmini.iso, minimal install, netboot iso\nHow do I make a bootable Ubuntu USB? - scroll down to 'How to make an Ubuntu Minimal USB using dd'\nThe new version 14.04 LTS 'Trusty Tahr' needs no fake-PAE. Use forcepae in the standard installers\nSometimes the boot option must be entered twice\n\nA: I'd suggest a minimal install using an alternate installer:\nhttp://www.archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/dists/precise/main/installer-i386/current/images/netboot/non-pae/\nDownload the mini.iso and install off that - when asked about the Linux Kernel choose \"linux-generic\"\nAfter that you should be asked for your desktop.  Pick one, or just continue without selecting one if you genuinely want no graphical desktop (pure server)\n\nA: But the server needs to be connected to the internet to install via that mini.iso...\nIf you want to do a standalone/offline install, download Ubuntu Server 11.04 (last server version without mandatory PAE) and it should install fine. Then you can just update it later as well via command prompt and it should correctly update to 12.04 NON-PAE for example.\n", "Q: Why can't pgrep find a process?

TLDR: I want to configure a box that is running Ubuntu Desktop and has two users so that it automounts a password protected Samba share when one user logs in, and doesn't when the other logs in.\nLong version\nOn my home network, I have two boxes: One runs Ubuntu Desktop, and the other is my file server that contains two password-protected samba shares (no guest access).\nUsers and accounts: There are two users, Bob and Jane. Bob and Jane both have their own separate usernames and passwords in all three places (i.e. separate Unix accounts on the desktop and file server, and separate samba accounts).\nSamba shares: The file server has two samba shares, Secrets and Shared. Secrets is configured so that Bob is the only user who can connect to it (in smb.conf under [Secrets], write list = bob, guest ok = no, etc). My question isn't about how to configure the samba share (sorry this is taking so long to set up my question).\nAuto mounting the samba shares: When Bob logs into the Ubuntu Desktop, Secrets is automounted using Bob's own samba creds, Nautilus displays Secrets as one of the places under \"Computer\" in the left hand nav bar so he can get to it without lifting a finger, the files and folders under that share display as being owned by Bob (ls -l /media/Secrets), and the file permissions display as -rw------- and folder permissions as drwx------. This I've accomplished by adding the following to my /etc/fstab with the separate file that contains Bob's samba creds.\n//centaroo.local/Secrets  /media/Secrets  cifs  uid=bob,gid=bob,credentials=/home/bob/.smbcredentials,iocharset=utf8,sec=ntlm,file_mode=0600,dir_mode=0700  0  0\n\nHere's the problem, and here comes my question: When Jane logs in, she, too, sees the label \"Secrets\" displayed prominently in the left hand nav bar in Nautilus, which is not the end of the world because she still gets access denied when she tries to click on it, but I'd prefer if she didn't even see the Secrets share in Nautilus. In other words, I want to change the settings somehow so that when Jane logs in, she doesn't even know Secrets is there, it doesn't attempt to automount, etc.\nHow do I do this? Since I want to automount Secrets for one user and not the other, is fstab the wrong way? Is it time for me to look into autofs, or is there a way to do what I want? I've followed instructions for mounting Windows shares permanently and glanced over documentation on autofs, but I'm not clear whether autofs is the answer. If anyone can point me in the right direction, I'd really appreciate it. Also, if there's any extra info that you need in order to help me, please indicate so in the comments. Thanks!\n\nA: I figured out how to do this without touching fstab, as I mentioned in my comment. The way I solved this problem is by adding a script in Startup Applications so that it gets run when my user logs in (but not when a different user logs in), and then I set up the script so that it can be run as root without entering a password. For more details the steps I took and how to run a startup script as root without supplying a password, see \"Mount samba share at login using startup script (not fstab)\" and \"How do I sudo a command in a script without being asked for a password.\"\n", "Q: How to get Ascii Ubuntu logo in terminal I was on some linux forum the other day on my phone and people where screen dumping  using terminal and everyone had ascii art of their computers they typed something like \"screenfetch\" or something I don't remember.\n\nA: A simple one is neofetch.

If there isn't a straightforward answer to this, I am abandoning the idea of ever using Linux outside of a work environment. Something with so much support and so many well-versed users should not be so difficult.\nEDIT:\nHere is what I get from gdisk:\nubuntu@ubuntu:~$ sudo gdisk /dev/sda\nGPT fdisk (gdisk) version 0.8.7\n\n Caution: invalid backup GPT header, but valid main header; regenerating\n backup header from main header.\n\n Partition table scan:\n   MBR: protective\n   BSD: not present\n   APM: not present\n   GPT: damaged\n\n ****************************************************************************\n Caution: Found protective or hybrid MBR and corrupt GPT.

As described on the Wikipedia article, you can identify a disk with an HPA set via the sudo hdparm -N /dev/sda command in Ubuntu.\n\n*Linux thinks the disk is part of a motherboard-based software RAID array (aka \"fake RAID\"), which effectively reduces its size by a small amount. The result is similar in that gdisk identifies the backup partition table as damaged. If this is the case, sudo dmraid -rE /dev/sda might fix the problem; but be very cautious about doing this, since if the disk really should have RAID active, this command may do serious damage to the disk!\n\n\nIf you need more help, post the output of sudo hdparm -N /dev/sda and some more information from gdisk -- specifically, the output of the p and v commands within the program.\n", "Q: How to set nano default syntax highlighting for files with no extension?

The jobs are meant to have one instance per user i.e they take in the user name as the instance parameter. I have also configured them to be respawned by upstart. The respawning works. Here is what my config file looks like\nstart on runlevel [2345]\nstop on runlevel [06]\n\nnormal exit 0\n\nrespawn\nrespawn limit 5 300\ninstance $user\n\nchdir /home/talha/syncservice/\nscript\n   exec python sync.py $user\nend script\n\nThe issue is that I want these instance jobs to be restarted on system reboot. Obviously I cannot pass in all the usernames as the instance parameters on reboot as I do not know what and how many instances were spawned last time. \nIs there a way that upstart can persist its state tables for instance jobs across reboots. Why I assume that there are some \"state table\"?, is because I assume that upstart keeps a track of all the running instance jobs. There would be a state table that tracks which instance to respawn when it crashes. Otherwise it wont be able to respawn an instance job. So if those tables can be made persistent across reboots my problem will be solved.\nCan the persistence be somehow achieved.? Where does upstart keep the track of its running jobs? Is it only in memory or a file?\nIf that cannot be done, that means that the stanza\nstart on runlevel[2345]\n\nhas no meaning or benefit for instance jobs.\n\nA: I would definitely lean away from getting under upstart's hood. You can do this another way.\nThe Cookbook's section on the instance stanza has some example of how to do things like this. I do something like this with multiple PostgreSQL instances; see this answer.\nThe basic idea here is to create what I call a \"pony engine\" job that starts all your instance jobs. In your case you could have it iterate through the sub-directories of /home, or keep a separate conf file that lists users you want the service to run for. For each user start a sync.py instance.\nYou are correct that the start on/stop on is useless in the instance job. Move it to the \"pony engine\" job.\nUnfortunately I don't have access to a Linux box right now, but see the aforementioned answer for examples.\n\nA: You could save the list of users to a file (user-sync.list in this example).  To restore the user scripts you could use a for loop in a bash script that's run by root at boot.  Where your init script is called user-sync:\n#!/bin/sh\n# /root/restore-user-sync.sh\nfor user in `cat user-sync.list`; do start user-sync user=$user; done\n\nAdd that to crontab, as root:\n$ crontab -e\n\nIn the cron file:\n@reboot /root/restore-user-sync.sh\n\nMaintaining the list of active users is the most involved part.  You could have the python script do that, or you could do it as part of the Upstart script:\n# /etc/init/user-sync.conf\n\nstart on runlevel [2345]\nstop on runlevel [06]\n\nnormal exit 0\n\nrespawn\nrespawn limit 5 300\ninstance $user\n\nchdir /home/talha/syncservice/\n\npre-start script\n    # if $user doesn't already exist in list, add $user to list\n    if ! grep $user user-sync.list; then echo $user >> user-sync.list; fi\nend script\n\nscript\n   exec python sync.py $user\nend script\n\npre-stop script\n    # remove line(s) from list that exactly match $user\n    sed -i \"/\\b$user\\b/d\" user-sync.list\nend script\n\nYou might be able to substitute $USER (which is automatically defined as the current username) for $user, otherwise when you call the upstart script you'll need to pass the username as a parameter:\nsudo start user-sync user=myusername\n\n", "Q: Are all Ubuntu update download servers HTTP only?

Well... happy until yesterday.\nAlthough with some difficulties to install ubuntu on it (Intel smart technology, High DPI not supported...), I solved all the issues and managed to enjoy a lot the world of Ubuntu (with a 1920*1080 resolution). \nHowever 2 days ago I naively accepted an \"Ubuntu base\" update. Since then I had to postpone my work for struggling on nvidia drivers issues and wrong resolution. Here are all the new problems I encounter:\n\n\n*\n\n*Stuck in High Resolution (3200*1800): in the system preferences, display tab, only this resolution available (built-in display only\navailable). It's particularly bothering because everything is\nextremely small in size.\n\n*Brightness control buttons not working. I also been looking a lot on google to solve this.\n\n*If trying to watch a video, these ones lag a lot (only 4-5 images per seconds). I can also notice this when I switch of workspace or if\nI write fast...\n\n\nThe followings might help you to understand my problem:\n\n\n*\n\n*No ubuntu loading logo when starting up.\n\n*Launching nvidia-settings seems to work, but my terminal will also display this error message: first line \"(nvidia-settings:7024): WARNING : PRIME: Failed to execute child process \"/usr/bin/prime-supported\" (No such file or directory)\" second line \"Message: PRIME: is it supported? no\"\n\n\nWhile trying to re-install (again and again) the nvidia drivers, I succeed to obtain all the possible errors  :) but never to make it work :(\nLastly I have been following this tutorial:\nhttp://wiki.belmankraul.com/linux/mint16_bumblebee\nThis is the last configuration I have (nividia drivers 331.38). \nNot sure if everything worked so I would like to add that: I am not using mint, only ubuntu, but nothing on the tutorial seems to apply only for mint...\nI have seen some solutions on similar problems would be to use nvidia-xconfig. I would prefer not because it will create a xorg.conf, which can affect my bumblebee configuration.\nIt is with a great pleasure I would provide you any command results or file' contents.\nThanks,\nEdouard\nPS1: I might be verbose... Tell me what is unrelated to my problem and I will edit my question.\nPS2: I have seen that version alpha 2 of 14.04 has been released few days ago. Might help? However this is my work station so I would prefer the most stable solution...\n\nA: Ok everything back to normal (resolution, brightness control, ubuntu logo loader during start up, video card...)\nHere is my guess of what happened: \nWhen I installed saucy, I didn't set up the nvidia optimus card. I had to specify the option \"nomodeset\" to the grub for being able to boot.\nHowever, when I updated my ubuntu base, it seems I didn't need anymore this option. I thought it was a problem of nvidia optimus and therefore installed bumblebee with the latest nvidia drivers (at least now I have it).\nI therefore solved my problem by changing my boot options like this:\nsudo gedit /etc/default/grub\n\nI changed this line:\nGRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT=\"acpi_backlight=vendor dell_laptop.backlight=0 nomodeset\"\nto this one:\nGRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT=\"quiet splash acpi_backlight=vendor dell_laptop.backlight=0\"\nand updated the grub:\nsudo update-grub\n\nI did a reboot and, the resolution was back to normal, the ubuntu logo load during start up was back, and no more lag with videos or desktop effects...\nHowever the brightness control buttons were still not working. This was due to my new drivers. I just had to read this thread in askubuntu: Changing the brightness stopped working in 13.10 saucy salamander , and applied the solution for intel video cards:\nCreating the 20-intel.conf file with:\nsudo gedit /usr/share/X11/xorg.conf.d/20-intel.conf\n\nAnd adding the following inside:\nSection \"Device\"\n    Identifier  \"card0\"\n    Driver      \"intel\"\n    Option      \"Backlight\"  \"intel_backlight\"\n    BusID       \"PCI:0:2:0\"\n\nEndSection\n\nReboot and all good :) Brightness buttons are working again :)\nI think my problem was very specific, not sure if it will help anyone...

Really you ought to ask the question on Unix & Linux - you can use the same StackExchange account.\nTo run most exe files, you can use Wine. You can install it in most rpm based systems with:\nsudo yum list wine*\n\nThen you can click on exe files, and open them with 'Wine Windows Program Loader'.\nAs for batch files, that is harder, but you may be able to use a Windows like terminal that comes with Wine - you can open that by running:\nwineconsole \n\n\nA: Exe files can not be run in Linux\nThe exe fileformat is something that Microsoft has coined and is something that only natively works in their operating systems.\nThere are, however, plenty of tools for you to run files with the .exe fileformat and the most popular one right now would be WineHQ.\nWine\nWine enables you to run software that only natively works in Windows, but in Linux instead.\nWine is not something that is foolproof and probably wont support every itty bitty application that you need to run.

On Master Boot Record (MBR) disks, this is often caused by stray GUID Partition Table (GPT) data or other easily-fixed issues; see my Web page on the subject or my FixParts utility, which can often fix such problems automatically.\nIf you've got a new computer with Windows 8.1 pre-installed, though, chances are it's installed in EFI mode, which means it uses GPT by default, and the usual MBR problems don't apply. You could still have partition table trouble, but the repair will be different. OTOH, if you re-installed Windows 8.1, you could easily have leftover GPT data, which FixParts will remove.\nIf you need more help, more detailed information is required, such as the output of the following commands (in Linux):\nsudo fdisk -l /dev/sda\nsudo gdisk -l /dev/sda\nsudo parted /dev/sda print\n\nNote that gdisk is not installed in an Ubuntu live CD by default, so you'll need to install it by typing sudo apt-get install gdisk before running the gdisk command.\n", "Q: Logitech K260 wireless Keyboard -not working but mouse works after upgrade 13.04 to 13.10 This is strange, but bear with me.\nI upgraded my 13.04 to 13.10 and everything appeared to upgrade flawlessly.\nAt the end, I rebooted and was able to use Logitech K260 keyboard to type in my password and get to the desktop screen.

My apologies if I missed something and this ends up being a double post!\nBasically, for a few weeks now my laptop erratically shuts down when running Ubuntu 12.04. What happens is that it displays the shutdown dialogue:\nShut down this system now?\nYou are currently logged in as ....\nThe system will automatically be shut down in 60 seconds.\nOK / Cancel / ...\n\nRegardless of what I do at this stage (press one of the buttons / do nothing), the computer will shortly after completely shut down. I mean shut down in the brutal fashion, as in turn itself off immediately with all software complaining after the next boot that they weren't shutdown correctly.\nI am running Windows in dual-boot and don't experience the same problem there. Maybe this doesn't completely rule out a hardware issue but it seems to make it a lot less likely. As most posts on similar issues talked about heating, I also installed sensors to monitor the temperature of my laptop (a Toshiba A660-18N). The HD is at around 30°C, the graphics card and CPUs fluctuate between 56°C and 62°C, so nothing out of the ordinary from what I understand.\nI looked in various log files for some hints as to what's going on, but didn't make progress. Below is an excerpt from the last time this happened. The laptop died at around 12:08:00 and I rebooted shortly after. The messages from 12:08:45 are from startup already.\nFeb  4 12:06:34 splinter kernel: [ 1504.401787] type=1400 audit(1391515594.358:36): apparmor=\"DENIED\" operation=\"open\" parent=1 profile=\"/usr/bin/evince\" name=\"/shared/Files/dphil/thesis/0_acknowledgements.aux\" pid=4562 comm=\"pool\" requested_mask=\"r\" denied_mask=\"r\" fsuid=1000 ouid=1000\nFeb  4 12:06:49 splinter kernel: [ 1519.750029] audit_printk_skb: 168 callbacks suppressed\nFeb  4 12:06:49 splinter kernel: [ 1519.750033] type=1400 audit(1391515609.706:93): apparmor=\"DENIED\" operation=\"open\" parent=1 profile=\"/usr/bin/evince\" name=\"/shared/Files/._Lbfgsb.3.0\" pid=4579 comm=\"pool\" requested_mask=\"r\" denied_mask=\"r\" fsuid=1000 ouid=1000\nFeb  4 12:08:45 splinter kernel: imklog 5.8.6, log source = /proc/kmsg started.\nFeb  4 12:08:45 splinter rsyslogd: [origin software=\"rsyslogd\" swVersion=\"5.8.6\" x-pid=\"1046\" x-info=\"http://www.rsyslog.com\"] start\nFeb  4 12:08:45 splinter rsyslogd: rsyslogd's groupid changed to 103\n\nDoes anyone have an idea what's happening here? I've been running 12.04 pretty much since it came out and only started experiencing this problem recently over the past few weeks. It seems particularly strange that the shutdown dialogue appears but then my actions are being ignored by it.\nAnyway, I'd be very grateful for any pointers on how to fix this or investigate it better.\n\nA: This could likely be a battery problem. If your battery is faulty, the laptop may crash even if plugged into the mains. You can check the battery by booting into Windows - there is a tool for that.\nAlternatively, try the following: Remove the battery from the laptop and run Ubuntu just plugged into the mains. If the computer no longer crashes then voila.\nI had this issue a while ago and this fixed it for me. Not sure exactly how this works, but I believe the shutdown dialogue would be triggered by the battery being seemingly empty / lack of power coming through and subsequently the machine will just turn itself off.\n\nA: Difficult to determine what could be causing this. The most logical explanation based on your question would be an old / faulty battery.\nI would try running your laptop plugged in without the battery. If this still persists, consider upgrading / downgrading your kernel or maybe upgrade to Ubuntu 13.10.\n", "Q: Strange recursive folder created on npm installation something very strange is happening to my system.

Had no idea while installing Ubuntu for the first time. So missed SWAP partition. Now, at times Ubuntu hangs and system monitor shows the memory usage full. Is there any method that I can create a partition from the current Ubuntu partition and assign it as SWAP partition ? If yes, kindly guide me to do the same. \nHow much SWAP partition space is recommended ? Current specs - 6 GB RAM, 1 GB Radeon GPU.\n\nA: *\n\n*To resize your Ubuntu partition and create a new swap partition from that space,follow the below steps,\n\n\n*\n\n*Boot Ubuntu live disk and then open Gparted.\n\n*Right-click on the Ubuntu partition and select Resize option to create a new unallocated space of the desired size.\n\n*From that unallocated space,create a new SWAP partition.\n\n*Now right-click on the swap partition and select and select swap-on.\n\n*Add an entry for your swap partition in /etc/fstab file to make swap-on the partition on startup.\n\n*See this for how much space did you have to allocate for your swap partition.\n\nA: First of all, thumbs up for this question. This is indeed a good one though there are similar questions which has been already asked such as \"I have 16GB RAM. Do I need 32GB swap?\". This will help you to decide how much swap that you may need to allocate. Even, it is said that a good rule of thumb on deciding a swap allocation is to double the actual RAM size. Having said that it doesn't mean you will need 12GB of swap allocation since you have a 6GB physical RAM. Swap may vary on what actual purpose that a user or their system has to deal with.\nBut by the look of your question, I doubt that something cocky going on the background or some sort of application/services hogging your memory (just an assumption). While moving on with the swap, there's an interesting article available on the Official Ubuntu page itself about swap FAQ's on creating, expanding swap... etc.\nI would suggest you to refer the part explained in-detail as; \"Four-step Process to Add Swap File\".\nSome Interesting Source: Importance of Swap Partition\n\nA: you have plenty of ram so dont need too much Swap space,\nLoad a Live enviroment (from CD or USB) so that your filesystem is free and you can edit its partition.\nuse gparted and lower your ext partition a couple of Gb\nAdd a new 'Linux_swap' partition\nreboot\nopen gparted right click on that section of partition and turn it on (alternatively use the disks program click on the swap partition and click the little 'play' button beneath)\nyou have plenty of RAM so don't need too much swap space, 2Gb is plenty enough, probably overkill.\nyou can increase performance of swap by using a different HDD than your filesystem, using the same technique just on a different HDD, this way you won't have to use a live enviroment either.\nP.S.

How can I solve this?\n\nA: You are likely compiling everything yourself. if you are 'unskilled' (I don't think so, just new) ubuntu user I would highly suggest the deb maintainers do the hard work for you. \nso check to see if apt-get has a copy which you want to use by searching like so. \naptitude search clang\nif it does great it will handle things, if not you can download tar ball here\nExtact it to /usr/local or /opt from there you can use it and delete the entire folder if you wish without any affects on your system. \nGoodluck.\n", "Q: Trouble with `nvidia-prime` on ASUS N550JV I have recently upgraded my ASUS N550JV notebook from raring to saucy and in the beginning, simply installing nvidia-319 together with nvidia-prime worked fanstastically (as described here).\nShortly after the upgrade completed, I updated all my software sources and did a dist-upgrade, which somehow broke nvidia-prime.

The computer currently has windows 7, which will boot and run fine, but I'd like to wipe the whole thing and just use Ubuntu.  \nI have created a live USB, and I know it works because I can actually run Ubuntu off the USB on my other laptop.

You could run each step separately, but you can't divide them in the middle of a command, as you did.\nThe first two steps probably executed correctly and the third isn't strictly necessary.  The errors you were getting on the fourth are probably due to the fact that the SDK team PPA is currently broken, as they just announced on the install page.\nA day later: The problem with the PPA is apparently fixed.

After searching around a bit, it looks like people have done this video piping (as discussed on Manipulating Dev Video and Fake a webcam using a video loopback device?\nAs mentioned in your comment, gst-launch v4l2src device=/dev/video0 ! v4l2sink device=/dev/video1 allows you to duplicate video0 to video1, and video1 is readable by some software.\nIn order to have this run when your computer starts, you can follow the UbuntuBootupHowto to come up with something like:\n# /etc/init/videocloner.conf\ndescription \"VideoCloner\"\nstart on runlevel [2345]\nstop on runlevel [06]\nrespawn\nexec gst-launch v4l2src device=/dev/video0 ! v4l2sink device=/dev/video1\n\nThis script should start when the computer boots and also allows you to run sudo service videocloner start|stop (Note: if my example script doesn't work, try moving gst-launch v4l2src device=/dev/video0 ! v4l2sink device=/dev/video1 into a shell script, and changing the exec line to call your shell script instead).\n", "Q: Cannot connect after upgrade from Ubuntu 13.04 to 13.10 I upgraded to 13.10 and now I have no internet connection.

Here's the thing:\nI have the responsibility to replace Windows XP with Linux on a HP Compaq DX2300. I will use Ubuntu since it is the flavour of Linux I am most familiar with. The computer will have two main missions:\nPrimary, to make data stored at extra internal harddrive able to access from other computers as a server.\nSecondary, to make use of a old scanner, ScanExpress A3 USB 1200 Pro, which driver is only compatible with i386/32-bit-system (have the driver in .deb-package).\nBoth this have to work. I would preferable use the server edition for 13.10 (only amd64), but will it work with the scanner, in any sort of driver backward-compatibility configuration? Since I will install Ubuntu without access to the network the computer later will operate on, how do I do with the installation? Is it easier to install the desktop version and convert it to server edition? I have installed the desktop version nearly twenty times before but I am new for the server edition, so I have not so much experience with the server edition. Thanks in advance.\n\nA: Rule 1: Use what you know the best\nSince you are more familiar with the Ubuntu desktop, install the desktop. Second, you will need some sort of GUI (the desktop) to run the scanning software. \nChoose your desktop wisely:\n32 bit: Since the scanner driver is 32 bit.\n12.04LTS: This version will continue to get security updates for three more years, while the 13.10 will stop getting updates in July 2014. In April, the new LTS version will come out (14.04LTS) which will be supported for 5 years after that date. \nFirst try \"Simple Scan\" the default scanning software with your scanner. Often it does not need extra drivers. If that does not work, install the deb file and try again.\nI assume the file server will serve files to Windows machines. \nFor this you will want to install SAMBA. See How do I use Ubuntu Server as file server? for detail on how to set it up. You may have to adjust the configuration file of SAMBA once you hook the computer up to the network it will serve.\nAlso see the official SAMBA setup documentation for Ubuntu 12.04LTS.\nBest\n", "Q: Low Screen Resolution The max I can set my resolution currently is 1024x768, but my laptop's native resolution is 1920x1080.

Since there is no zoneinfo file named UTC0, the setting gets reinterpreted as being in the \"std offset\" format instead  (as in tzset(3)).

Your screenshot says:\n\nAlienware M14xR1/M14xR1, BIOS A04\n\nSo I think this is the support page of your laptop. If you look under the BIOS sections you will see two available BIOS updates. (One of them (A08) is even marked as \"Urgent\", but I think it is only urgent for those who installed A07) You can also look at the A07 version of the BIOS under \"previous versions\", where it says: \n\nFixes & Enhancements: Modify SATA speed limit to SATA2\n\n(So maybe there is some kind of SATA speed mismatch causing this problem for you, just guessing.) \nSo I would advise you to update you BIOS to the latest available (A08) and check the results. \n\nA: A computer does not operate random, so behavior which looks random is because either the input is different or the hardware is broken.\nNormally crashes appear random because the state of the computer is seldom the same with all programs running, but at the very early start random behavior is quite rare and are mostly due to hardware problems since there are not so many ways the input can differ with every boot.\nThe most common hardware problems which can remain undetected and unresolved are memory problems. Hard disk problems are normally being detected and the spots marked. Processor, cache and bus are constantly used by all programs so errors here would render a non-workable system or would only go wrong onces every hour or so, not repeatable at the same spot.\nI would start by using a Ubuntu live cd to do a thorough memory test (couple of hours, different patterns) before spending too much time in software solutions. If a memory error pops up you can tell the kernel not to use that part of memory by passing badblock as boot parameter.\nbtw. The memory test is hidden now a days, see link\n\nA: What you haven't told us is the hardware configuration. I noticed that your HD is 120GB therefore I suspect it's an SSD. The problem is your SSD. You need to upgrade the SSD firmware - which may require you to reinstall everything. If that doesn't work then your SSD is bad.\n", "Q: Can't enable Bluetooth in 13.10 I've been having a really hard time with this one...\nI've had my ASUS X301A since last year, solely under Ubuntu 12.04 until recently (a month or so), when I switched to 13.04.

I can give you a hint and maybe an assumed solution ;). I had trouble with my BT adapter (which is USB) as well two weeks ago. Mine is:\nBus 004 Device 002: ID 0a12:0001 Cambridge Silicon Radio, Ltd Bluetooth Dongle (HCI mode)\n\nBut I had exactly the same symptoms as you described it wit 14.04 LTS. After a long research I found out that the bluetooth drivers became a little bit buggy some months ago. It has something to do with a set mode when the driver tries to initialize the BT device. As far as I can remember it was a Bugfix that turned out to not work very well with some devices. \nSee BT kernel driver became unstable. There is also a link to a patch that made my BT dongle work again: Fix unstable BT driver patch\nI did not apply the patch to my kernel because I am short of time for the moment and BT is not so important for me but since the patch is applied to next Ubuntu kernel for 14.04 LTS I installed this kernel and BT worked perfectly again. Since I have a NVidia Graphic Card I could not use this kernel because nvidia 304-updates package does not work with this release, but on commandline all worked fine.\nIf it is possible for you switch to 14.04 LTS and wait for the next kernel release or download kernel-source package, apply the patch and compile a kernel of your own.\nHope it helped, I wish you good luck\n", "Q: Bootable DVD 12.04.3 LTS works on some Windows XP PC's, not on others I downloaded 32bit 12.04LTS to DVD and loaded on three different Windows XP PC's (one as dual boot).

I've just reformatted the hard drive and installed Ubuntu 12.04 on one.\nIn descending order of priority, the things I want to be able to do on the Ubuntu machine are...\n\n1: Run Google Chrome to access the Internet\n   2: Run Foobar2000 to play music\n   3: Run VLC to watch movies (through TV connected as a second monitor)\n   4: Code development (specifically, port my Foobar speech plugin so I can use it without Windoze)\n\nSo far the only \"non-default\" thing I've done is to install Chrome as the default browser. That was easy, because it was already available in the Ubuntu Software Centre which I accessed from the Dashboard just using the mouse.\nThe Ubuntu machine has an ATI Radeon HD 4300 video card, which is more than capable of supporting the 1920x1080 resolution I'm used to on this monitor. But when I go into System Settings and select Screen Display, I'm only offered a choice between 1024x768 or 800x600.\nI downloaded *iiyama_drivers.zip,* opened it, and found a folder containing three files E2407HDS with extensions *.cat, *.icm, and *.inf, but I don't know what to do next.\n\nI'm writing this question on the other PC (running Windoze XP because I'm finding the relatively lo-res Ubuntu browser window awkward). Both machines are powered up, and I've been using the switch box to swap between them. The Ubuntu system has just \"auto-updated\" itself with several things, including something called fglrx which appears to be a proprietary driver for ATI Radeon video cards. But the Additional Drivers facility in Ubuntu still says No proprietary drivers are in use on this system, and the Screen Display facility still only offers the lower resolutions.\n\nPlease note that I'm a complete noob as regards Unix/Linux/Ubuntu. I don't even know how to access the \"command-line prompt\", let alone what or why I should type anything in there. And I'm leery of experimenting because short of re-installing I've no idea to get back a functional system if I mess up.\nSo - how can I easily (ideally, using just a mouse) improve my screen resolution?\n(I know I should only ask one Q per post, but a link to \"system snapshot backup\" would be good, too.)\n\nA: I'm having a similar problem with my AMD HD 7770, but have gotten at least so far in finding solutions, and figure this might help you a bit. The first, which does I'm afraid require the Terminal, can be found by following the instructions found here:\nhttp://community.linuxmint.com/tutorial/view/877\nI would however do step 3 and 4 first, as in my experience they will undo progress made in steps 1 and 2, but don't require them to work. I have however found the X.Org driver to be useless for gaming on my machine. I don't know whether the case would be the same for you. The Terminal (which is the equivalent to the Command Prompt in Windows) should be very easy to find. Simply search for it in the Dash (accessed through the Ubuntu Button at the top-left).\nThe other option is to switch to the proprietary driver. This can be done going into Settings>Software and Updates>Additional Drivers. You'll probably need to restart for the changes to take effect. For me this has given a maximum resolution of 1600x1200, which I know isn't ideal, but is a step in the right direction I'm sure. In addition, games have worked well, so that's something. It does appear though that this won't work with the first fix for whatever reason. I've tried. If you were to do this fix, I think the big problem now would be a cap that can't be edited in Catalyst Control Centre, which is annoying, even when root.\nI don't know how far this will get you, but I hope you can pull something from this if you haven't found a fix yet. :)\n\nA: The iiyama driver is for Windows only.\nInstalling fglrx is the correct way but it does not activate the driver. I don't know why your Ubuntu does not show the driver in Additional Drivers but you can activate it with\nsudo amdconfig --initial\n\nand it would be activated after reboot. You would need to run this in terminal, there is no other way if Additional Drivers are not working.\n", "Q: 13.10 login loop workaround creates unwanted root access Neither lightdm not gdm actually allow me to log into any account but guest.

The catch is, I share my laptop with another user, and I don't want the Samba share to be mounted when she logs in. I only want it to be mounted when I log in. That rules out editing my fstab file because I want this to be user-specific.\nPrior research\nI've searched and reviewed lots of questions and answers related to mounting Samba shares, including \"Mounting Samba Shares at boot/login and using script\" and \"Proper fstab entry to mount a samba share on boot,\" but most answers involve editing fstab, which works great for most people but that's not what I'm looking for here.\nWhat I've done so far\nI can manually mount the Samba share from the command line by doing this:\nsudo mount -t cifs //centaroo.local/Me /media/Me -o uid=scott,gid=scott,credentials=/home/scott/.smbcredentials,iocharset=utf8,sec=ntlm,file_mode=0600,dir_mode=0700\n\nProblem statement\nThe previous command works great when I execute it from the command line - it prompts me for my password to gain sudo permission, I enter it, and the command runs. The problem is, when I add the exact same command to the \"Command\" field in Startup Applications Preferences > Edit Startup Program, save my changes, reboot, and log back in, the Samba share isn't mounted like I expected. I suspect it's because I need root permission to run as sudo, and with the script in the Startup Programs Preferences, there's no way for me to enter it, so the script simply fails.\nHow can I work around this?\n\nA: Okay, I managed to solve this on my own (with the help of others). The underlying problem was, as I suspected, the fact that I was trying to run a command that required root privileges without supplying a password. I solved this problem by following the instructions in the thread \"How do I sudo a command in a script without being asked for a password\". The long and short of it is, I created a shell script called \"script-mount-samba-share.sh\" that contains nothing other than a single line with the mount command that I want to run:\nmount -t cifs //centaroo.local/Me /media/Me -o uid=scott,gid=scott,credentials=/home/scott/.smbcredentials,iocharset=utf8,sec=ntlm,file_mode=0600,dir_mode=0700\n\nThen, I changed the file's ownership to root:root and changed its permissions to 700. Next, I set up sudo to allow running that script without entering a password, and then I changed the \"Command\" field in Startup Applications Preferences > Edit Startup Program to \"sudo /home/scott/script-mount-samba-share.sh\" (without the quotes), and voila. Next time I rebooted and logged in with my user, the Samba share mounted without my lifting a finger. I also tested that when I reboot and log in with a different user, the Samba share does not get mounted, which is what I want.\nThe only minor catch that I'm now trying to overcome is, when I'm already logged in and then switch users to someone else, my Samba share still shows up in the left hand nav bar in Nautilus, which makes sense as it was mounted when I logged in with my own user, but I don't want the mounted share to display in Nautilus for the other user, so my next task is to figure out how to make that part happen.\n\nA: It is important to add the username and password for the mount command, otherwise it might ask for the password. for me this worked: \nsudo mount -t cifs //centaroo.local/Me /media/Me -o uid=scott,gid=scott,user=,password=,iocharset=utf8,sec=ntlm,file_mode=0600,dir_mode=0700\n\nof course with all the changes in /etc/sudoers\n", "Q: Formatting a USB flash drive as ext4 I'm making a custom bootable USB flash drive with a persistent partition. Formatting the partition as ext2 obviously makes the filesystem very sensitive to improper unmounting. I remember a while back that Ubuntu (and other distributions) had problems when Flash memory was formatted as ext3/4, writing data so frequently that the flash drives died very quickly. \nHave these problems now been resolved? Is there any reason to not use a journalled filesystem when formatting a USB flash drive?\n\nA: I think that usb drive's every cell has it's own limit number of read/write.\nSo journaling is not used.\nsolving this problem may be very difficult.\n\nA: I use the ext4 file system and turn off journaling in USB drives and memory cards. I also set the mount option 'noatime' in /etc/fstab in an installed system. See these links,\nInstallation/UEFI-and-BIOS\nPendrive lifetime\nLifespan a flash drive running Ubuntu?\nFinally, backup the system or at least your personal data at regular intervals and whenever important data are stored!\n\nA: Even if there were I'd still journal the USB stick. There is a slim possibility that it would increase the wear on the drive, but it's not nearly as certain as the fact that if you mistakenly fail to umount the thing properly one time you will be boned. The answer is buy more drives when they wear out, not turn off the only protection the filesystem has against damage.\n", "Q: Missing package in Ubuntu SDK - qtdeclarative5-ubuntu-webapps-api Installing the Ubuntu SDK failed because of missing package \nqtdeclarative5-ubuntu-webapps-api\n\nthis was the message from apt-get:\nThe following packages have unmet dependencies:\n ubuntu-html5-sdk : Depends: qtdeclarative5-ubuntu-webapps-api but it is not installable\n                    Depends: ubuntu-html5-container but it is not going to be installed\n\nCan I get this package somewhere else?\n\nA: The ubuntu-html5-sdk metapackage only exists in Trusty (14.04), for which qtdeclarative5-unity-action-plugin should also be available (even though it shouldn't be required, according to the package details).\n\n\n*\n\n*Are you installing the SDK from the package repository?

I want to ask about how to set interval of synchronization in Ubuntu One? \nBecause I don't want to immediately synchronize my changes of file (because in 1 minute there can be more than 10 changes in a file). This behaviour makes conflict and sometime my file reverted back to previous changes. If there is a configuration for synchronize every hour or only synchronize for files that has changed for more than 10 minutes maybe it would be helpful. Thank you\n\nA: There is no such setting.

Fortunately (maybe) I had backed up most of the folders from /etc and /home using Backintime (root). I installed BIT on the new system. The BIT information was stored in a separate HD, with the same path as was used for the original backup.  I copied the config file from the last snapshot:  /Backup/backintime/{old host name}/root/1/{latest backup folder} to ~/.config/backintime/.\nWhen I try to use BIT it cannot find my snapshots.

If so, how? Is there something else I need to change somewhere?\n\nA: I discovered how to recover the files (I still could not use the Restore function of BIT). I found that the problem with recovering my .thunderbird folder was caused by the permissions (owner: root and read-only).  Once that was fixed, I was able to recover that. It was not as critical to me, but I was also able to recover my .mozilla folder by fixing the permissions.\n\nA: BackInTime version < 1.1.0\nYou have to deactivate Auto Host / User / Profile ID and change the value for Host to match your old systems hostname. After that all snapshots should be shown in the main window.\nBackInTime version >= 1.1.0\nOn first start BackInTime will ask if you would like to restore your old config. Maybe connect your external drive and click Yes. It will scan your drives and collaps all folders with snapshots. Just select the snapshot from which you would like to restore the config and click Restore.\nDisclaimer: I'm member of BIT-Dev Team\n", "Q: My wallpapers are pixelated I have downloaded multiple backgrounds over 4000x4000 pixels, and somehow they still end up pixelated when i set them as my background in unity.

How big a leap is it to look into writing a driver? Any recommendations on resources?\n\n\nA: Writing drivers is a whole different ball game.\nEven though they do not support it NI does have some well working cards. Good to see :)\nFrom their help:\n\nSome NI audio interfaces can also be used under Linux operating systems. This includes AUDIO 4 DJ/AUDIO 8 DJ, AUDIO KONTROL 1, GUITAR RIG MOBILE I/O, the KORE 1 controller, the second and third generations of the RIG KONTROL, and the SESSION I/O interface. Both the audio and MIDI functions of these devices are supported.\nThe necessary ALSA drivers are included in kernel versions 2.6.22 and above. Native Instruments does not provide any kind of support or guarantee for these drivers or for using its products under Linux.\nFor more information on ALSA drivers, please see here.\nAll Native Instruments ALSA drivers are listed here.\n\nThere is no Z1 amongst it and there are drivers for ALSA so you could track down someone who is in charge of these and ask if they are willing to help with a Z1. But that might be seen as inappropriate.\nThe part in bold sounds promising though; sometimes you can use another cards setup (as in the previous version) to get a newer one working since internally lots of cards are identical.\nHow about start debugging the information as asked here. This will gather all the information needed to get it supported. Maybe it is fairly easy to get working based on the current working cards.\nBesides that I would start a conversation on the ALSA mailing lists to get this card on their radar. Sometimes all it needs is a little attention to get things rolling.\nGood luck.\n", "Q: Unable to check the RAM usage per user I was recently wanting to check the RAM usage per connected user on my server but could not find a way out.

I have been trying to get my laptop's screen brightness to default to a low setting, and for my keyboard light to be off when I start my computer.\nI have these two commands that work when I execute them at the command line:\nxbacklight -set 7\necho 0 | sudo tee /sys/class/leds/asus::kbd_backlight/brightness\n\nI put them in my /etc/rc.local file, like so:\n#!/bin/sh -e\n# ...\n# By default this script does nothing.\necho 0 | tee /sys/class/leds/asus::kbd_backlight/brightness\nxbacklight -set 7\nexit 0\n\nHowever, neither command executes. (I was told that the sudo was not needed in the second command when placed in /etc/rc.local)\nThere was another question asking the same thing about rc.local, but I tried to also include my commands using the Startup Applications GUI interface. That also did not work, so I think the problem might go beyond just the rc.local file. Other default startup commands in the list seem to start, so far as I can tell.\nWhy am I unable to get any custom command line to execute when I startup?\n\nNew: After some experimentation, it seems like the commands I put in /etc/rc.local might be getting executed before the login screen. So, my login screen has the screen appropriately dimmed. However, then when I login, my screen goes to maximum brightness. So it seems like perhaps there is some other setting that is being applied when I log in, or that /etc/rc.local only applies for the login screen itself and has no bearing on what happens to a user when logged in.\nSo, how do I resolve this so that the brightness and keyboard light settings I want apply to the user login session, not just to the login screen?\n\nA: xbacklight solution\n1) Create an executable script file e.g. /home/YOU/.bin/lower-brightness like this:\n#!/bin/sh\nxbacklight -set 7 &\n\n2) Create a .desktop file e.g. /home/YOU/.config/autostart/lower-brightness.desktop like this:\n[Desktop Entry]\nType=Application\nExec=/home/YOU/.bin/lower-brightness\nHidden=false\nNoDisplay=false\nX-GNOME-Autostart-enabled=true\nName=Lower Screen Brightness\nComment=Screen brightness is set to 7 at startup\nIcon=display\n\n\nA: To have the display settings as you want you can add this line in /etc/rc.local\necho 7 > /sys/class/backlight/intel_backlight/brightness\n\nThen it can keep your brightness as 7.\nhope that helps a bit.\n\nA: I'm sure, my solution should help you if you use ubuntu with lightdm.\nI was searching for turning on NumPad on my laptop when it starts and in lightdm documentation I found this:\n# display-setup-script = Script to run when starting a greeter session (runs as root)\n# greeter-setup-script = Script to run when starting a greeter (runs as root)\n# session-setup-script = Script to run when starting a user session (runs as root)\n# session-cleanup-script = Script to run when quitting a user session (runs as root)\n\nAnd that is solution. You need to create file in /usr/bin/, say /usr/bin/backlight and write commands there.\n#!/bin/bash\nxbacklight -set 7\necho 0 | sudo tee /sys/class/leds/asus::kbd_backlight/brightness\nexit 0\n\n(Also xbacklight doesn't work for me. echo 7 > /sys/class/backlight/intel_backlight/brightness does the stuff). Than make sure you add execute permission for this file with chmod a+x /usr/bin/backlight.\nThan you need to edit /etc/lightdm/lightdm.conf and write for example this line:\nsession-setup-script=/usr/bin/backlight\n\nAnd that's it. Now restart you PC.\n\nA: Create your own init script to adjust the brightness levels. \necho '#!/bin/sh \nsleep 60\necho 0 | tee /sys/class/leds/asus::kbd_backlight/brightness\nxbacklight -set 7\nexit 0' > /tmp/myinit\nsudo mv /tmp/myinit /etc/init.d/myinit\nsudo chmod +x /etc/init.d/myinit\nsudo update-rc.d myinit defaults  \n\nAdjust the sleep value to your suit.\n\nA: I wonder why no one has suggested using update-rc.d. I would not put the script into /etc/rc.local manually. I would recommend this way to make programs run at startup:\nsudo cp lower-brightness.sh /etc/init.d/\nsudo chmod +x /etc/init.d/lower-brightness.sh \nsudo update-rc.d lower-brightness.sh defaults \n\nThis will make sure the script is linked to appropriate run levels. \n", "Q: Eclipse always starts with /root/workspace Eclipse is always starting with /root/workspace .

I know nothing about the Graphics issue, never have had the graphics issue in the past.

Install Windows 7 on the NTFS partition first.\nNext, after the Windows installation, boot Ubuntu from a Live USB and start the installation. The Ubuntu installation will prompt you and ask if you want to dual-boot Ubuntu alongside with Windows, select that. Let the installation complete.

However, this GUI only supports setting 1 minute at the minimum. For a delay between 1 and 5 seconds we need to set this manually.\nYou can use dconf watch / to watch all settings that are being changed.\nIf you issue that command, then open the Brightness & Lock panel and change the setting for Turn screen off when inactive for..., you will see an output like this:\n/org/gnome/desktop/session/idle-delay\n  uint32 180\n\nHence, in order to set it to a value of for example 5 seconds, issue the command:\ndconf write /org/gnome/desktop/session/idle-delay \"uint32 5\"\n\nSource & more information: How can I set a global timeout for the screensaver?\n\nA: Such things can be directly controlled with gsettings. For example to get a list of all the screensaver settings available to tweak:\ngsettings list-recursively org.gnome.desktop.screensaver\n\nAjusting lock delay after screen fade:\nYou should be able to adjust the lock delay (this is time after blanking that locking occurs) with\ngsettings set org.gnome.desktop.screensaver lock-delay uint32 5\n\nto give you a 5 second delay before lock.\nAdjusting the fade screen delay itself (blank screen time):\nYou can set\ngsettings org.gnome.desktop.session idle-delay uint32 5\n\nwhich I is the blank screen time (time for screen to fade), to give a 5 second fade for example.\n", "Q: How to find the location of my Grunt package via CLI command?

The host machine is on the network as 10.0.0.28. The guest machine is being managed by Vagrant, using VirtualBox 4.3.6 as a provider.

So I juggled about the uid for vagrant, as I have read that NFS access is controlled by matching the IP address and uids.

Setting the insecure flag meant it was allowed though.\nThis problem obviously doesn't affect the non-virtual machine DevMatt.\n", "Q: libgnome-window-settings-dev - package not found I use UBuntu 12.04 LTS - I have to install all dependencies listed here: link Apt can't install libgnome-window-settings-dev\nsudo apt-get install libgnome-window-settings-dev\npackage not found. \n\nHow to fix that ?\n\nA: The package libgnome-window-settings-dev does not exist for Ubuntu 12.04, the only installation candidate can be found for Ubuntu 10.04 (lucid). \nGo through this link of packages.ubuntu.com to see the details.\n", "Q: Switch between Keyboards I have two text entry resources: English & Persian.

Google and perhaps greater familairity with BIOS settings than you, resolved the problem for me. It's common for older BIOSes not to offer the USB drive as a boot option unless there's a bootable drive inserted into the USB port, and this seems to be quite a common source of confusion.\nYour question reveals that you have misunderstood something about how the BIOS works or what it is - Windows XP does not display a message when you go into the BIOS, as Windows XP is not loaded when you enter the BIOS.

I currently have my machine partitioned with Windows 7 & XP; and since XP will soon no longer be officially supported I want to replace that partition with Ubuntu. However I also already  have an Ubuntu OS running on the same drive, is there a way to Integrate the XP partition to already installed Ubuntu system? Or do I need to do a clean Install?\n\nA: As suggested in the comments above you can use gparted, which can be installed by typing sudo apt-get install gparted.\nIf the Ubuntu partition and XP partition are next to each other, they can be made into one by deleting the XP partition and extending the Ubuntu to use the free space. You will receive a disk check error when you boot ubuntu because it will detect the drive change, but don't worry, nothing is wrong. Just let it run through.\nIt will depend on the order. For example if the XP partition occurs before the Ubuntu partition then the free space cannot be added because partitions are extended from the back end, meaning you will need to move (you can do this in gparted) the Ubuntu partition forward then extend it. Doing so however will prevent you from being able to boot ubuntu so make sure you know how to fix a grub entry (I don't or I would have typed it here).\nAdditionally the placement of your Windows 7 partition is important. For example if Windows 7 is the first partition on the drive then it's ability to boot won't be affected by changes to partitions behind it. However if XP and Ubuntu are installed before Windows 7 and you delete one of those partitions it could prevent Windows 7 from booting. Before you attempt anything I strongly recommend you post a screenshot of gparted so that whom-ever assists you can see where everything is, and you should state wether or not you have a Windows 7 installation disc.\n", "Q: Installing windows 8 on Ubuntu 12.10 with windows 8 already installed I don't know that if it sounds confusing but what I want to do is that install windows 8 along with Ubuntu 12.10 (already installed). I have windows 8 previously installed as well and I want to overwrite it. Is it possible to do so? How can I do this without using a USB or a DVD?\n\nA: You want to install it without a USB or a DVD. You need to make an empty partition (you can use gparted to do that) with the windows 8 DVD contents and boot from it. I think this step is much harder than using a DVD or a USB drive but anyways that's how to do it without them.\nYou do need to format the current win 8 partition. You can do that also using gparted or I think you can do that directly when you're installing windows 8; It should ask you whether you want to format the old windows 8 and then reinstall it.\nThat's pretty much it! ask me about anything you don't understand. (like for example: what I mean by \"booting from the partition\" or how to do it).\n", "Q: What is the easiest way to create a meta upstart script I want to have a \"meta\" upstart service that start/stops several other upstart services.\nWhat is the easiest way to do this?\n\nA: I do this for multiple PostgreSQL instances along with their pgagent instances. Check out this answer.\n\nA: If you plan to have a single script always start/stop the same scripts, you could just include all of those scripts directly in the original (single) script.  If the other scripts don't need to be Upstart scripts (if they're executable scripts or binaries) then another option is to have a single shell script that starts them in the background, and the single Upstart script would stop them when it shuts down.\n", "Q: Install Ubuntu but keep Local disk D and its content I want to install Ubuntu and remove Windows 7.

I'm clueless :(\n\nA: 1) You need to run gparted from Live CD/USB otherwise it can't unmount your Ubuntu partitions.\n2) You can then resize the primary partition to include the free space behind it (2149MB).\nThe remaining 2 small free sections are parted's partitioning requirement I guess, you don't need to touch these.\n\nA: The free space is to the right corner. you cannot simply add extra space present somewhere on the hdd to any partitions. for your case, you need to shift 2gb adjoining your partition. this means that you have to delete your swap and the extended partition and then resize your main partition to accomodate for the extra space.. then you have to create a new partition for swap. after this is done, you have to edit the entry in /etc/fstab to change the uuid to the new swap partition.\nthis cannot be done within your server. you have to live boot into ubuntu desktop(preferrably), use gparted to delete partitions. note that swap cannot be deleted unless you first right click it and select swapoff. then perform the procedure.\n\nA: A simple way that can stress a bit the hardware is to create a raid (1 maybe) array with mdadm with all free partition. \nThis way you don't need to move partition but you are asking your hard drive to work a lot more.\n", "Q: Lenovo G510 with 12.04 LTS issues I have a few problems with my recently purchased notebook lenovo G510 and as a beginner I do not know how to solve those problems. \nto the point: my AMD Radeon graphic is not worknig at all and the brightness buttons do not function as well - there are some tutorial to help but I was unsuccessful.

Hybrid Graphics are problematic in Linux right now, there's nothing that will work 100% for everyone. I recommend disabling the discrete AMD GPU so that it won't chew up your battery life.\nTo resolve the brightness button issue you're having, follow these steps:\n\n\n*\n\n*Open up a terminal (Ctrl + Alt + T)\n\n*Type in the command:\ngksudo gedit /etc/default/grub\n\n\n*In that file you will find a line like this GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT=\"quiet splash\". Append the following after splash acpi_backlight=vendor so the line looks like:\nGRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT=\"quiet splash acpi_backlight=vendor\"\n\nAnd save the file and exit gedit.\n\n*Now in the terminal execute the following command:\nsudo update-grub\n\nNow reboot and your brightness buttons should work.\nYou probably have the discrete card running and chewing up your battery. If so, you can disable it via vgaswitcheroo. Type this command in a terminal:\necho OFF > /sys/kernel/debug/vgaswitcheroo/switch\n\nTo make the changes to persist after reboot you can put this command in your /etc/rc.local so that it executes at every bootup, in a terminal execute:\ngksudo /etc/rc.local\n\nAt the end of the file before the exit 0 line, paste the command echo OFF > /sys/kernel/debug/vgaswitcheroo/switch, save and you're good to go now the discrete GPU will be disabled at boot.\nFor more information see HybridGraphics\n", "Q: How do you redirect the output of lynx to print only the last 20 lines of its output?

Is there anything alike for ubuntu 12.04 or how could i otherwise setup this domain alias for a localhost address? \n\nA: You can alias your host domain, which is fairly simple. You define it in /etc/hosts\n127.0.0.1  wintermute.example.com\n\nHowever, you will not be able to route the host to that specified port without adding it to whatever the resource calling the custom domain is.

Now, every time I want to create a file or a folder in this copied directory, it says permission denied. So, I have to use sudo every time.\nThe problem is that I can create files/folders in other directories under the home directory, except this one. I tried changing the permission of this directory recursively to 755 but still the same problem.\nCan anyone point out what the exact problem I am facing is? And how do I get around this?\n\nA: The folder, quite obviously, is property of the root user, which is why you have to use sudo in order to interact with the folder. I don't think chown is able to apply permission changes to a folder, so you would have to go for the graphical route, as explained below.\n[EDIT] A folders location typically doesn't affect it's permissions level or owner. For example, I could be the owner of a folder sitting in /usr/share/, but root could be the owner of a folder on my desktop. If you're wondering why it is this way, I'd say ask Bell Labs. They started it. :)\n(I used Nemo, but the steps are the same for Nautilus)\nFirst, open a terminal and type sudo nautilus (again, I used Nemo, but it's the same procedure), and enter your sudoer's password.\n\nWhen Nautilus opens, navigate to the folder you wish to change permissions on. Depending on what program you use, you may see and \"Elevated Privileges\" notice. This is to remind the user to be careful with what they do, as root permissions could damage the computer if used the wrong way.\n\nNow right click the folder you want to change and choose \"Properties\" go to the \"Permissions\" tab, and it should look something like this:\n\nSelect the dropdown menu for Owner and Group, and change them from \"root\" to your username (in my case, ben). It should look like this now:\n\nIf desired, click \"Apply Permissions to Enclosed Files\".

I have three monitors (two 1080p and a 1680x1050; all Viewsonic) and a TV (1080p; Vizio).  The monitors and TV are all connected to the Nvidia cards (two heads per card, DVI connections) and I don't have anything connected to the built-in Intel.  \nI want to:\n\n\n*\n\n*Get all the monitors to display an image\n\n*Be able to drag a window, either from an application or just a folder, from monitor to monitor\n\n\nMy computer is dual-booting Ubuntu Gnome 13.04 and Windows 8.1.  The monitors and TV work fine in Windows 8.1.\n===========\nI currently am running Ubuntu Gnome 13.04.  That's not because I love Gnome, it's because I was actually able to get a window to move from one monitor on one video card to another monitor on another video card with the Gnome Put extension -- well, when I booted from the Ubuntu Gnome Live CD, at least.  I'd actually prefer KDE.\nProblems:\n\n\n*\n\n*I can't use Nouveau.  Noveau causes the fan on the 9600GT card to spin at 100%.  Installing an Nvidia driver fixes that problem.\n\n*I've tried various guides both here and elsewhere to install the latest Nvidia drivers and had almost no success.   I've generally been able to get one of the drivers from the repository (319) to work, but for not more than two monitors.  There was one exception: when I tried Linux Mint 16 KDE.\n\n*Whenever I've enabled Xinerama, I'll get all black screens at reboot, even in recovery mode.  When I try, for instance, ctrl-alt-f1, I'll hear the 9600GT's fan start up, then spin down, then spin up, etc., but never get video.\n\n\nThanks for your time!\n\nA: Well, that was difficult.  I have a thread on this here and at Mint's forum.  I'm going to update both because I made it work.  I want to save folks a couple weeks of misery.\n\n\n*\n\n*I'm using Kubuntu LTS, now. It's 12.04.4, the update that came out a few days ago, which uses the Linux 3.2.0-58 kernel.  I'm still using 64-bit.\n\n*I'm using the Nvidia 304.116 driver.  I'll elaborate on the install in a few paragraphs.\n\n*I'm using Xinerama.\n\n*I didn't enable the TV, just because I was getting annoyed that the login window was appearing there, thus meaning I had to turn on the TV to see the login prompt.\n\n\nProbably the most major thing I learned is from the folks at archlinux.org: \n\"Warning: As of August 2013, Xinerama is broken when using the proprietary NVIDIA driver from 319 upwards. Users wishing to use Xinerama with the NVIDIA driver should use the NVIDIA 313 driver, which works only with Linux kernels earlier than 3.10.\"  \nThe kernel in Kubuntu 13.10 is 3.11.  The recommended driver (i.e. what you get when you use \"sudo apt-get install nvidia-current\") is 319.\nAlso note, according to Tom's Hardware, Nvidia display drivers have a problem displaying to four monitors with drivers higher than 295.\n==============\nThe actual install was quite simple:\n\n\n*\n\n*Install Kubuntu 12.04 from the CD.  Reboot into your installed OS (i.e. don't reboot to the live CD).\n\n*Install all the Kubuntu updates through Muon Update Manager (hey, it's KDE).  Reboot.\n\n*Start up Konsole (\"Terminal\") and do \"sudo apt-get install nvidia-current.\"  Reboot.\n\n*Start up Konsole and do \"sudo nvidia-settings.\"\n\n\nHere's a fun thing that several folks have reported after the *ubuntu 12.04.4 update: if you hit \"Apply\" in Nvidia settings control panel app, the program dumps you back to the desktop and doesn't save your changes.\n\n\n*\n\n*Make all the activations/moves/changes you want to all the screens.  Just remember that you want a separate X screen for each monitor.  When you're happy with all the settings, put a checkmark in the Xinerama box and hit the \"Save to X Configuration File\" button.  You want to save it as /etc/X11/xorg.conf.\n\n*Reboot.\n\n\nEasy-peasy.  I think that's even fewer steps than setting up multiple monitors on a Windows box.    \nNow, I'm not exactly a Linux newbie, but I don't know off the top of my head how to check to make 100% sure that I don't have some bit of Nouveau lurking someplace that will cause a problem with some high-graphic game or 3D rendering thing.  All I know is that before I installed the driver, my 9600GT video card's fan would be at 100%.  It's now really quiet.  I also don't see any big spikes in disk activity, so  I don't see any great need to do any Nouveau exorcism. \nMy xorg.conf file follows.

Will application still shutdown correctly? I've had to remove the /etc/init.d/crashplan script by doing update-rc.d -f crashplan remove in favour of starting the daemon using /etc/rc.local (the reason for this is that I have an encrypted home dir that only gets mounted upon user login, and this is causing the backup daemon some issues during boot, see here for more details).\nThis all seems to work pretty work for starting the service only after login, but what I'm wondering is if Crashplan will still shutdown correctly on system reboot or halt without the sys-v-init script links in /etc/rcN.d?\nTo be honest, when I did the update-rc.d -f crashplan remove only a startup script from /etc/rc2.d was removed anyway, which makes me think it's probably fine. However,I just wanted to check I should be putting kill symlinks in the 0,1,6 runlevel dir?\n\nA: I guess I should still keep the Sys-V-init kill links at the 0,1,6 runlevels:\nupdate-rc.d crashplan stop 20 0 1 6\n\nso that it still shutsdown correctly on shutown/recovery/reboot.\n", "Q: apt-get doesn't work behind a proxy My company uses an HTTP proxy and our various Ubuntu 12.04 servers therefore need to be configured properly, namely by setting \\etc\\apt\\apt.conf.d\\80proxy to:\nAcquire::http::Proxy \"http://proxy.mycompany.com:80\";\n\nAcquire::http::No-Cache true;\n\nNow, since a few days, this method suddenly stopped working: I run into sum mismatch errors.

This is done by editing the /etc/sudoers file. Be careful while doing this! Use only the sudo visudo command to edit the file; any errors may leave you unable to re-enter sudo mode! Add the following:\nDefaults env_keep+=\"http_proxy https_proxy ftp_proxy socks_proxy\"\n\nThis ensures that sudo retains these variables when executing sudo apt-get install ... etc.\nI found this out from Ubuntu's apt-get howto.\nDo let me know if it works :)\n\nA: I don't know if you tried this already but what about:\nexport http_proxy=proxy.mycompany.com:80\n\nYou can check it afterwards with:\necho $http_proxy\n\n\nA: One trap here is that if after setting up your proxy as an unprivaleged user you run \nsudo apt-get install REQUIRED_PACKAGE\n\nwhere REQUIRED_PACKAGE is the software you want installed and you still see that it hangs when contacting tha machine beyond your proxy then it will likely work you pass -E to the sudo command as follows ...\nsudo -E apt-get install REQUIRED_PACKAGE\n\nThis has the effect of running your command as root using your current environment (your proxy environment settings)\n", "Q: Disabling gedit backup files (filename~ tilde) How can I get the following command to change for the root user as well?  \ngsettings set org.gnome.gedit.preferences.editor create-backup-copy false\n\nThis command should disable gedit backup files.

Rmano provided the following script:\nmkdir ~/TILDEBACKUPS\n#!/bin/bash\n\nfind $HOME/* -name TILDEBACKUPS -prune -or -name \"*~\" -print -exec mv {} $HOME/TILDEBACKUPS/ \\;\n\nAlso, as pointed out by Rinzwind, scripting gsettings may require a lot of maintenance as schema names change.\nFinally, there was a bigger mistake here that led me to even asking this question.

Is there a reason why you want to do it that way? Because if it's no biggie to you, then I it would be a lot easier if you organized the folders on the hard drive the same as the Samba share. Also, do you want to restrict each user so that he or she can only access their own files, or is it okay if anyone on your network can read, write, delete, etc in anyone else's files? The answer to this question would affect whether you create a separate Samba share for each user versus having one Samba share for all.\nIf you have one Samba share for all, then just create a single mount point (i.e. /media/share) and when any user connects to the Samba share, they get all the child folders the same way they are organized on the Samba server. On the other hand, if you want separate access privileges, and hence one Samba share for each user, then still the only folders you would need to create on the hard drive are the separate mount points for each user (i.e. /media/Alice, /media/Bob, etc). Then, when each user connects to his or her Samba share and they automatically get the folder hierarchy described on the left in your picture.\n", "Q: How to list all available printers from terminal?

I need help. I have an HP Pavilion g7 and I was wondering how to fix it. What happened was it originally came with Windows 7, and I upgraded to 8, but today I decided to make the switch from windows to Ubuntu, so I partitioned my hard disk, and backed up everything to one partition, which I don't wanna delete because It contains my backups, and partitioned again. I also kept note, luckilly, of how much free space Windows 8 had. And when I booted to Ubuntu, I gave all of the free space to swap and I deleted the Windows partition (Note: I left the system partition there, that was there maybe after upgrade to 8.) Then, I installed Ubuntu where Windows was originally. It completed install, and I reboot it, then get a suspisious black screen, so I power off the PC, and power it back on, I then get a Light-Blue (Like the color of the sky) screen with white text, it says something like this:\nRecovery\nA required device cannot be accessed or is not plugged in.\nInsert your installation media or contact your system administrator.\nI try hitting enter, screen goes black for a split second and re-appears, the same thing happens when I press F8. Is there any way to fix this without completely formatting the hard disk?\n(Note: I followed a video by AvoidErrors about dual-booting Windows 8 and Ubuntu 13.04, but instead deleted the Windows Partition (Atleast I thought it was due to the amount of space used, all the other partitions were full, except the Windows one, which was half-full.) It was also obvious AvoidErrors was using a Virtual Machine instead of actual hardware.\n\nA: \"Is there any way to fix this without completely formatting the hard disk?\"\nI don't think so. But maybe you can try to boot a Live CD or Live USB with Ubuntu to see what really happened to the disk partitions.\n", "Q: I Have Two Versions of Java? I currently have the 3s and 64 bit versions of java. This is causing some errors, and I want to get rid of the 32 bit version. What do I do to get rid of it?\n\nA: Refer to location /usr/lib/jvm and find the 32-bit folder by reading its docs and readme etc.\nThen remove the folder of 32-bit Java version. you must have to be root to remove. \nAlso remove the environement variable path of 32-bit Java, type env at Terminal and see JAVA_HOME and similar to this one.\nFor example if you want to remove JAVA_HOME_32, you would type at terminal with root permission.\nenv --unset=JAVA_HOME_32 \n", "Q: 4GB out of 8GB total reserved 64bit 12.04 why Can anyone explain why 50% of my ram is being reserved and for what?

bother about Ubuntu using half of my RAM, as it is usually used to cache information to be able to access them very fast.

Sorry for the caps, some people miss the improtant part. Also I know an alternate cd would work but they don't make them for newer Ubuntu releases so if I need to do this with 14.10-14.04 I'll be prepared. \n\nA: There's really no way to roll back to a previous install. You can download and create a bootable USB, and then replace your 12.10 with a 12.04 LTS install leaving your user data untouched. Of course, 12.04 is different from 12.10, so you'll have to lose the data that makes 12.10 different from 12.04. You would also have to re-install any applications you'd added to the base 12.10, but that's not difficult. \nYou really need to make a reliable backup of all your user data first, even if the re-install won't touch it, because stuff happens.\n", "Q: What do I need to do to preserve sda2 and sda4 paritions, and format sda3 for Ubuntu and part of it as swap area?

I didn't think this would be a problem, as the digitzer worked out of the box in a previous 10.04 install, but I've spent hours trying to find a solution this time around.\nAny help would be greatly appreciated.\n\nA: I've had a similar trouble with a motion computing M1300 and it almost drive me mad.\nYou asked about two months ago, and although this answer may be arriving late, I hope it helps anyway.\nSoooo here we go:\nFirst thing first:\nYou don't have to install any driver. It's already installed in your Xubuntu 12.04. You just have to configure the stylus in Xorg.conf.\ntake a look at this post:\nhttp://ubuntuforums.org/archive/index.php/t-1840911.html\nThe solution its at the end where it says :\n\nI also tried installing and patching inputattach but that doesn't seem to work\n   either...\n   Well that argues it is ISDV4. I'd feel better if we saw an ISDV4 product ID though.  \n   Good you checked that out.\n\n\n   OK, this assumes your xorg.conf is empty. If instead there is something in it, \n   probably to do with your Intel integrated video chipset, please post it. You'll \n   still add the Wacom sections but we'll need to change the \"ServerLayout\":\n  \n\n   Section \"InputDevice\"\n   Driver \"wacom\"\n   Identifier \"stylus\"\n   Option \"Device\" \"/dev/ttyS4\"\n   Option \"Type\" \"stylus\"\n   Option \"Button2\" \"3\"\n   EndSection\n\n   Section \"InputDevice\"\n   Driver \"wacom\"\n   Identifier \"eraser\"\n   Option \"Device\" \"/dev/ttyS4\"\n   Option \"Type\" \"eraser\"\n   EndSection\n\n   Section \"ServerLayout\"\n   Identifier \"X.org Configured\"\n   InputDevice \"stylus\"\n   InputDevice \"eraser\"\n   EndSection\nBefore you change anything if you have an xorg.conf first back it up. Backing up and restoring xorg.conf from the command line is discussed in Old serial tablet driver part II. on \"HOW TO Set Up a Wacom Serial Tablet\".\n\nUse:\n\ngksudo gedit /etc/X11/xorg.conf\n\nAll you have to do is:\n\n*\n\n*Type  \"dmesg | grep ttyS\" in a Terminal window.\nYou showd get something like:\n\" 0:11: ttyS0 at I/O 0x3f8 (irq=4) is a 16550A\"\nNote that the \"ttyS0\" value may be different for you.\nWrite down the \"ttySX\" obtained.\n\n\n*Create,or modify it if it already exists, a xorg.conf file as indicated in the\npost replacing \"ttyS4\" with the \"ttySX\" value obtained in step 1.\n\n\n*Reboot and enjoy.\nIn my particular case, the problem was that I assumed the stylus was not working because it was too old for new distros.\nThe result of doing a \"dmesg | grep ttyS\", at command line, lead me to think the wacom tablet model of my M1300 was an old serial ISD4. This kind of wacom tablets are not supported by new ubuntu ditros. But reading that post I discovered that Motion Computing M1300 and M1400 have ISDV4 wacom tablets that are fully supported but need to be configured in xorg.conf file.\n", "Q: Application Finder or Launcher for Mate and Gnome Session Fallback? Mate and Gnome Session Fallback desktop environments are almost alike and really lightweight and it is the most preferred desktop environment for me.\nOnly thing I miss is some way to search installed applications quickly as we do using Unity-Dash.

Sad to say that it's core repository no more available to install. Couldn't find any way to install in 16.04 so far. \nThough I found an another nice Application Launcher albert for Ubuntu 16.04. Here are the steps to install albert launcher:\nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:flexiondotorg/albert\nsudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install albert\n\nEnjoy :)\n\nA: What you need is Synapse:\n\nSynapse is a semantic launcher written in Vala that you can use to start applications as well as find and access relevant documents and files by making use of the Zeitgeist engine.\n  https://launchpad.net/synapse-project\n\nInstallation:\nsudo apt-add-repository ppa:synapse-core/testing\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get install synapse\n\nThis is like Unity-Dash, and very powerful.

It is available in ubuntu software center. If you want to run windows programs which don't need installation, it will be enough for you. But, if you want to install windows programs, although it is possible to do this with wine, I strongly recommend you install playonlinux. It is a front-end for wine. It is also available in software center, and if you install it, it will automatically install wine, so you don't have to worry about installing them both. It is important that you enter playonlinux and not play on lnux, as it will not find it in the search if you enter it with spaces. If you want to install games or some other more advanced windows programs, you'll need to install additional components. Note that playonlinux has a list of components needed for some programs, so it can install the components and programs automatically. \n", "Q: Disk Failure is Imminent after Partion with gParted I was trying to partition my drive.

How to resolve it? Is there any fix or I have to change my Hard drive ??\n\nA: These events are unrelated. Partitioning is not a cause for the diagnostics on a hard drive to fail. Your hard drive is likely to fail soon and it's just a coincidence this happens after using a partitioning tool.\nBack up your data soon and replace the drive.\n\nA: If you are using the latest version of Ubuntu, run the Disks tool and check the S.M.A.R.T data for that drive to see what the problem may be...  Maybe Gparted picked up on something while you were partitioning the drive itself and Ubuntu is reporting a problem because of it...\n\nA: If there are errors, it might be that your drive is a bit damaged inside. Your USB drive might have aged. This is normal. Therefore, your disk has a self-monitoring and  early-warning system built-in which tries to notify you of its aging. Replace the drive soon. \nTo get more info abot the damage:\nRun; (or install, and then run) gnome-disks. \nYou'll see something like this.\n\n\nAlternatively, you may as well keep/put  unimportant data on this disk,  until it finally fails.\nThere is nothing you can do to fix it (inexpensively). Disk failure is an unpredicatable, \"statistical\" process. \n", "Q: Wireless networks never show up, after trying almost everything I got a new laptop and I installed Ubuntu 13.04, and then I noticed wifi isn't working.

Besides syslog, is there any ubuntu logging for cron jobs, to see if they run or don't and why?\nAlso, is that the proper way to send arguments? Does the script need to accept them any differently than a web based script?\n\nA: First, validate your command works properly from command line:\n/usr/bin/env php /path/to/script.php arguments\n\n\nSecond, validate your cron is running: \nps auxw | grep cron\n\nThere should be line like (highlights with ^ mine)\nroot      1537  0.0  0.0  19112   336 ?        Ss    2012   1:03 cron\n^^^^                                                             ^^^^\n\n\nIf cron is running properly, check other cron messages from syslog:\nsudo zgrep CRON /var/log/syslog*\n\nBy default, various tasks run as root, configured in /etc/cron.daily, /etc/cron.weekly etc. folders. If there's no output, your cron is not running properly. Try restarting it with\nsudo /etc/init.d/cron restart\n\nAnd check contents of /var/log/syslog for error messages, and proceed to step 1 again\n\nIf cron is running properly, proceed to check mailbox of the user that has that command on their crontab. Replace USERNAME.\nsudo -u USERNAME mail\n\nor\n    sudo -u USERNAME less /var/mail/USERNAME\nIf executing cron command fails, it should send email to there.\n\nYou should use /usr/bin/env php /path/to/script.php as your command, instead of just php. /usr/bin/env automatically selects proper php binary.\n\nFor arguments, no, you have to read arguments separately. That's off-topic for this site, but take a look at this manual page. You can read those arguments from $argv.

I now use echo, but ideally the result of $(basename \"{}\") should be the argument of some other function I want to write.\nWhy is the basename function not applied correctly?\n\nA: The shell is interpreting the $(...) before it runs find. If you want the find shell to execute it instead, you'll need to stop bash substituting it.

They can technically not switch to USB 3.0 mode and are always served by the operating system of your host computer as USB 2.0 devices (or worse, depending on the USB controller of the host computer, the cable used or other glitches).\nWhen the software (libmtp) cannot find your device, the first step would be to find out if your device is supported by the software. While the libmtp project does not maintain a list of supported devices, searching online for \"libmtp supported device\" + device name + USB vendor ID and device ID should give you results.

I have a Lenovo U410 with a hybrid drive (30 gb SSD for cache, 750 HDD). I found it really difficult to do so. My BIOS has something called UEFI mode (dunno really what that is) and while reading around, I understood that might cause some problems to a certain extent.\nThings I have tried:\n\n\n*\n\n*Boot via flash drive created with pendrivelinux\n\n*Made an ext4 partition on my HDD\n\n*Start the installer\n\n*Ubuntu did not see any other OS installed\n\n*Was able to install it only on my SSD after I created a partition table on it.\n\n\nI thought to myself that probably installing on the SSD should be fine, especially since I do not need more than 30GBs since I want to use it especially for scripting/developing.\nUnfortunately, after I have done so, Ubuntu booted, but my windows refused to boot at all. It was probably given the fact that the cache was 'corrupt' with Ubuntu.\nI then tried to install Ubuntu via wubi. It booted up okay, I can now dual boot. However, my windows performance drastically reduced since I installed Ubuntu via wubi. This happened to me in the past on some other laptop, but after I managed to partition it properly, everything was back to normal.\nAny thoughts on how I should go about this? I really want Ubuntu since I find developing in it so much smoother than in windows.\n\nA: I recommend you read the following two pages:\n\n\n*\n\n*My Web page on installing Linux on EFI-based computers\n\n*The Ubuntu community documentation on EFI installations\nKeep in mind that your disk probably appears to be a single disk to any OS, including both Linux and Windows, so you shouldn't need to do anything special with it -- at least, not compared to other EFI installations. (EFI normally uses the GUID Partition Table [GPT] rather than the older Master Boot Record [MBR] partitioning system.)\nYour claim that you installed Ubuntu via WUBI is suspect. The last I heard, WUBI did not work with EFI-based Windows installations, which essentially all Windows 8 and 8.1 pre-installs are. Furthermore, WUBI is on the way out, so using it on a new installation is inadvisable because it may become difficult to support such installations in the near future. Overall, I suspect that you installed in some other way and for some reason you think it was WUBI, but it wasn't.\nIf you need more advice, I recommend you run the Boot Info Script, post the RESULTS.txt file that it produces to a pastebin site, and post the URL for your document here. That will give us a better idea of your current configuration.\n", "Q: How can I install Open Office?

this warning since the default-installation of Ubuntu 14.04 Trusty Thar.\nSo this does not help for me. The result is still the same. And I found that there is a big discussion already there on launchpad. Just look here:\nhttps://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/grub2/+bug/1258597\nBut the comment #10 on this link shows the trick, how to sort things out. The file /etc/default/grub needs to be edited at the second line and at the third line as shown on the comment #10 on this above link of launchpad:\nsudo gedit /etc/default/grub\nGRUB_DEFAULT=0\nGRUB_TIMEOUT_STYLE=countdown\nGRUB_TIMEOUT=5\nGRUB_DISTRIBUTOR=`lsb_release -i -s 2> /dev/null || echo Debian`\nGRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT=\"quiet splash i915.modeset=1\"\nGRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX=\"\"\n\nThen do:\nsudo update-grub\n\nThis sorts things out...\n\nA: Grub Customizer adds or edits files in /etc/default/grub.d so the file you need to fix is in this directory, which is why there is nothing wrong with your /etc/default/grub file. \nAdditionally, the error tells you to inspect line 165 and the file you need to inspect is /boot/grub/grub.cfg.new.\nSo, go to the file /boot/grub/grub.cfg.new and scroll down to line number 165. This is where the syntax error is. At the beginning of each section of code, there is a line that starts with ### BEGIN followed by a configuration file name. This is the file that contains the error you need to fix.\nSee this detailed example by user @donquixote.\n\nA: I have saved an original /etc/default/grub file in my pastebin for such situations. Open a terminal and do \nsudo cp /etc/default/grub ~/default-grub.bad\nsudo wget \"http://pastebin.com/raw.php?i=g3TMZgTP\" -o /etc/default/grub \nsudo update-grub \n\nSee the file in raw format here\nAdditional suggestion:\nYou have a bunch of kernels installed. Try to remove the old ones. You can use a program such as ubuntu-tweak or synaptic. \n\nA: I had a similar problem that I resolved it just deleting a menu I had in Grub Customizer. After removing this menu, Grub Customizer has started to save again without problems.\n\nA: You have screwed up your /etc/default/grub file by placing several commands on a single line that is commented out, but broke up the last one in half on the next line that is not a comment.  \"echo Debian`\" GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT=\"quiet splash\"\" is part of the previous command and must be on the same line.\n", "Q: Make Calibre to ask for an application each time I have a huge ebook library of pdf files very big ones and small ones too.

I need a way so that every time when I click on a PDF file to ask for an application to open it by default.\nNote: I use Calibre to manage my library, so \"Right-click → Properties → Open With\" is not available. \n\n\n\nA: A possible workaround might be that you first open the path to folder (\"Path: Click to open\" in the righthand pane with the book details). The file manager opens the folder with the containing file and you can right-click and choose your application from there.\nIt does take a couple of more clicks, though.\nThere is a plugin \"open with\" (see here) you could use.

What can I do about that? Many questions here ask for how to get a certain MTP enabled device (a phone, tablet or media player) working, assuming that the device is somehow supported by current FOSS software.

For detailed instructions see: How can I install the latest version of libmtp?\nFiling a support request for your device\nIf compiling from source didn't work, chances are that your device is currently not supported by libmtp. A list of supported devices is available which will be sourced during installation or building of the package to create 69-libmtp.rules.\nIf in doubt, just follow the procedures on the project homepage to open a bug report/support request for adding a new device, it's basically running lsusb -v, unless you have experience in programming and submitting patches.\nNote: It's useful to provide the name of your device and a link to the product page if possible. Also try searching for the device and vendor ID, you may find that the manufacturer uses the same ID for other devices and that a support request for this ID has already been filed and committed to GIT but hasn't been released a a source package or stable release.

I have a netbook I use for school, and sometimes it doesn't suspend properly when I close the lid, causing it to get hot inside it's case. I opened it today and it was at 150F. It worked, but I didn't like the smell (probably just the superglue on the bezel). \nI was wondering if there's a way I can lower what the critical temperature is so it shuts down at around 140. Is there a way to do this? Does it have to be done in the BIOS? (something I read in another thread). It's an HP1103\n\nA: You can try Computer Temp at Computer Temperature Monitor\n\nComputer Temperature Monitor is a little applet for the GNOME desktop\n  that shows the temperature of your computer CPU and disks on screen.\nIt also allows you to log temperatures to a file. You can set alarms\n  to notify you when a tempertature is reached. Several monitors can be\n  added to the panel to monitor different sensors. It is designed to\n  look like CPU Frequency Gnome applet, so they match each other on\n  panel.\n\nOther way around it is to cool your CPU temperature frequency throttling:\nSepero Hacker: Linux: Cool your CPU temperature with frequency throttling\n\nA: The better option is to follow the advice in the comment (try to see what has failed when you closed the lid). \nAs a workaround, or a safety net, you can use a script running in background, something like this one, which depend on the package lm-sensors being installed:\n#! /bin/bash\n\nwhile true; do\n    t=$(sensors | grep temp1 | awk '{print $2}' | sed 's/\\..*$//')\n    if (( $t > 95 )); then   # max temp in whichever units your sensors outputs\n        echo High temp $t\n            #sudo /usr/sbin/pm-suspend   # uncomment after testing.  \n    fi\n    sleep 60\ndone\n\nYou have to change temp1 to something relevant for you (look at the output of the command sensors in a terminal). In my case it is: \n(0)asus-romano:/etc% sensors\nacpitz-virtual-0\nAdapter: Virtual device\ntemp1:        +61.0°C  (crit = +98.0°C)\n\ncoretemp-isa-0000\nAdapter: ISA adapter\nCore 0:       +46.0°C  (crit = +100.0°C)\n\n...and I want to check temp1. You have to put a string that is able to select only the line you like, so that the pipe in $(..) outputs only the temperature numner. You can test it by hand in the terminal:\n(0)asus-romano:/etc% sensors | grep temp1 | awk '{print $2}' | sed 's/\\..*$//'\n+61\n\nTo being able to do the poweroff with sudo without being asked for a password, you can add a file to the directory /etc/sudoers.d: \n(1)asus-romano:/etc% sudo cat /etc/sudoers.d/power-off\nromano ALL=NOPASSWD: /usr/sbin/pm-suspend\nromano ALL=NOPASSWD: /sbin/poweroff\n\n(adapt with your user, obviously --- note that the file content is just the two last lines. The name of the file is irrelevant, see more here)  --- now your user will have the power to use this two commands (with sudo) without being asked for a password. \n\nA: Another solution may be to \"hibernate\" instead of \"sleep\". With \"hibernate\" the netbook really shuts down, so there's no way it will heat up. And it's fast too, though not that fast.\n", "Q: What does functional_qml_application_uses_QtWebKit mean? In a review for my click package, I saw the following  message:\nfunctional_qml_application_uses_QtWebKit\n\nWhat does it mean and how do I fix it?\n\nA: Note that the QtWebKit test is a warning, not an error. Application developers are free to use QtWebKit, however there are major caveats: \n\n\n*\n\n*qtwebkit won't get security support (not from Ubuntu/Canonical nor Upstream) and \n\n*once Ubuntu moves to oxide, won't be getting as much testing and its utility will likely decrease (indeed, future Qt versions will drop it entirely). Then you will be able to 'import Oxide' if you should need more functionality than from UbuntuWebView.\n\n\nUbuntuWebView will always work, get the testing and get the security updates since it will be using Oxide. Oxide, once integrated with UbuntuWebview will also bring performance improvements and added functionality over QtWebKit. This should not block app approval, but may slow down the review process and it is highly recommended that app developers use UbuntuWebview whenever possible.\nIf you are currently suffering from shortcomings in UbuntuWebView, please file bugs on the webbrowser-app project in Launchpad.\n", "Q: Steam opengl glx context is not using direct rendering I have a fresh install of Ubuntu 13.10 with the latest Nvidia drivers installed. However, when I run steam I am presented with the following message:\nsteam opengl glx context is not using direct rendering\n\nI believe this is something to do with not having the correct 32 bit library, however I did install the Nvidia 32 bit libraries when I installed the driver. Running Steam from the terminal I can see that Steam is failing to find the 'swrast' driver which it shouldn't be looking for anyway.\n\nA: I solved the issue by removing and purging my previous Nvidia driver and upgrading to the latest beta Nvidia Driver 334.16.

I got a \"drive for /tmp is not yet ready or not preset\" error for 1-2 seconds when I booted it but then it booted just fine.\nI checked the startup logs but didn't see anything weird \n\nA: I don't know what you can do to make sure the system is not damaged. \nThe biggest potential problem is loss of data in the cache waiting to be written into the hard disk. the files in /tmp are temporary and are deleted when you shut down properly. A hard reboot leaves them behind, and the error you saw probably told you just that. Ubuntu checks the health of the hard disks after X number of proper shutdown / restarts. You may want to do that manually by booting from a LiveUSB/DVD\nSHORT STEP-BY-STEP TUTORIAL FOR CHECKING EXT4 HARD DISK FOR ERRORS\nSTEP 1. Ensure you have access to a Ubuntu LiveDVD/Installation Disk. If not, download a copy using another machine.\nSTEP 2. Change the BIOS on your machine to allow you to boot from a CD.\nSTEP 3. Insert the Ubuntu disk into your CD-ROM and reboot your machine. Choose the option to 'Try Ubuntu' -- don't reinstall the system!\nSTEP 4. Once Ubuntu starts (you will not be required to provide a password) you will be in the main desktop.\nSTEP 5. Open a teminal by pressing Ctrl+Alt+T \nSTEP 6. Get a pen and paper to write down the paths to your disk drives. Note that when Ubuntu boots it identifies all the hard disks on the system and creates a directory in the '/dev' folder for each. By default these devices are not mounted. If you see a picture on your desktop of a drive then a disk is mounted. You must unmount all disks that are to be checked before proceeding! \nSTEP 7. Search for Disk Utility in Dash and open it to see what drives are on your system. Use this to verify the drives are not mounted. Also note the addresses of the disks to be checked... they should look like /dev/sdc or /dev/sda1. Also, ensure the drives are actually ext4 and not some other format. Once you recorded the paths then exit the Disk Utility.\nSTEP 8. To proceed with the check type sudo fsck.ext4 -cDftvy -C 0 /dev/sda1 in the terminal -- remember to substitute your device address. You can only do one disk at a time. On my machine 1TB of data took 3 hours to complete and the bulk of the time (99.99%) was spent checking for bad blocks. If you want to know what the parameters mean then check out the links at the bottom of this post or type fsck.ext4 in the terminal to see a short list of the common command options. Note that fsck.ext4 appears to be a synonym for e2fsck.\nSTEP 9. As the fsck command has been passed the (v)erbose option parameter details of the progress and any errors will be listed in the terminal window.

I entered the wrong username the first time I tried to connect. The username has been grayed out every time I've tried to connect after that:\n\nWiFi usernames are stored in config files inside /etc/NetworkManager/system-connections/ but having to enter terminal commands to edit a config file in vi just to connect to WiFi is abstrusely convoluted to most people.

Under Passwords, Login, it should be listed as a Network secret for WIFI-NAME.  You can double-click that and change the WIFI password in the dialog.\nNote, although can edit wifi connections by clicking the Network icon in the status bar and then, Edit Connections, you can't change the password there, but you can using the above method.\n", "Q: Can't see cursor in 13.10 I'm trying out Ubuntu 13.10 but I can't see the cursor.\nCan anybody help me?

Are there any merits?\n\nA: The most direct benefit is that you don't have to install Ubuntu yourself. This makes it an attractive option for novice users who may not be comfortable installing an operating system, thus allowing Ubuntu to better compete with preinstalled Windows systems.\nAlso, if the system has Ubuntu instead of Windows, you don't have to pay the \"Microsoft tax\", by buying a computer with Windows which you won't use and then installing Ubuntu.\nFinally, a preinstalled Ubuntu version may contain additional tweaks and drivers to allow Ubuntu to utilize all the features in the hardware. Sometimes \"stock\" Ubuntu will  run poorly on a particular system, but the preinstalled version is specifically tuned by the manufacturer to work correctly.\nThat doesn't mean that you'll be forever stuck with the version of Ubuntu that came preinstalled; usually the changes to make the system work are merged with the next version of stock Ubuntu.\n", "Q: What does ~/ mean before a directory's name in the terminal?

For example, my desktop directory is at\n /home/marc/Desktop\n\nor\n ~/Desktop\n\nfor short.\n\nA: ~ is a shortcut for the home directory, so \ncd ~/mydirectory \n\nWill move to mydirectory if there is such a directory in your home folder, otherwise it will throw a directory does not exist error.\nExample:  \n\nYour home directory is located at /home/<username>.  \nTrivia: This is why the default bash prompt has a tilde in it like this user@host:~$. The tilde indicates that you are currently in your home directory. If you move somewhere else, for example into /etc it will show user@host:/etc$.\n", "Q: cairo-dock starts up at the bottom-right When i turn on my computer (ubuntu 13.10) the cairo-dock starts up automatically but it starts up at the bottom-right as you can see in the photo.\nI solve the problem closing cairo-dock and starting it up again, but at every system start up I have the same problem!\nhttps://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/43867401/Schermata%20del%202014-02-06%2012%3A43%3A30.png\n\nA: I had the same problem in Ubuntu 14.04 Cairo-Dock. On start up the dock would align to the right of the screen and half the apps could not be seen. To bring it back into alignment I have to right click on the dock, go to Cairo-Dock, configure and before the configuration window popped up the dock would realign itself. Then had to close the configuration window. Had to do that every time I rebooted. I tried to uninstall and re install the Cairo-Dock through the command line, but that did not work.\nI right clicked on the Cairo-Dock, up to Cairo-Dock, configure, then wait for the configuration window opens. Go to themes tab to your right. Click on the theme you have chosen and have been using. Go to apply down the bottom right. Now you will have a choice, green tick, continue and loose any changes you have made or red cross to cancel.

I think I may have a virus. How would I go about checking for a virus and how can I protect my computer from any other virus? Please give detailed answer as I'm still learning about Ubuntu.\n\nA: To scan for viruses on Linux, you'd us clamav. You can install it from the repositories using the software center.\nIf you're new to Linux, this is the perfect time to try out the command line interface, because it works well, and it's hard to screw anything up.\nIf you're feeling up to it, open a terminal window by typing Ctrl+Alt+t.\nIn that window, type sudo apt-get install clamav. This will tell the computer that a \"super user\" is telling it to install the clamav virus scanning software. It will ask for your password.\nNow that you've installed the software, you need to update the files that it uses to identify viruses. You should type sudo freshclam. Your computer will know you're a super user because you just typed in your password a few seconds ago.\nWhen all is done, you're ready to scan. If you'd like to scan your home directory (all your user files), you'd type something like\n clamscan --remove=yes -i -r ~/\n\nThis calls on clamscan to remove any virus it finds, show you only infected files, to act recursively by running through every subdirectory of you home directory. ~/ is shorthand for your home directory. You might want to run it without the --remove flag just to see what it finds first.\nIf you were to type man clamscan you'd see a list of options. As I said, this is a great place to start using the command line.\n\nA: Avast! has free antivirus for Linux, which you can use to check Ubuntu for viruses and remove if any were found. Here is how you can install it.\n\n\n*\n\n*Download it form here\n\n*Open the file and install it\n\n*register your free account here\n\n*You must change Ubuntu's shmmax to accept updates(as they are too big). This is how you can do this. Open terminal (Ctrl + Alt + T) and enter: \ngksudo gedit /etc/init.d/rcS\nAdd this line of code in a new line directly before the line, which should already be there, exec /etc/init.d/rc S\nsysctl -w kernel.shmmax=128000000\n\n\n*Save it and restart computer\n", "Q: Dual-Boot Windows 7 alongside Ubuntu?

Now I have this ridiculous situation where I can't even log in, while the system and programs are still running and constantly swapping gigabytes of memory back and forth.\nThe graphical login does not even appear. After I pressed Ctrl-Alt-F1 and waited a couple of minutes, the text login appeared.

Sometimes I get to the password prompt, but still it times out after 60 seconds. I am still trying right now, anyone has a better idea? I can't even properly shut down like this. Actually it would be enough to close some Chromium tabs (or kill their tasks), just how?\nBy the way, it is only one program and one website that causes alle this havoc: Chromium and Facebook. Though Facebook renders very fast in Chromium, it uses a lot of memory – like a couple of hundred MB for each tab.

I for one have had a couple of this and were solved by disasembling the laptop and cleaning the area. Normally a lot of dust or simply cloaked air flow can cause this. On other models the \"smart\" idea of having the cpu and gpu on the same place created the problem. I also recommend using the Nvidia PPA because they have:\n\n\n*\n\n*Been checked for compatibility with Ubuntu\n\n*Have the latest official updates.\n\n\nNOTE - Be aware of an issue you might encounter.\nBut as a first step, check to see if the air flow is working correctly and do a bit of cleaning on that zone, check the temp of the video card (also check the cpu) and keep the rules on how to use a laptop handy like not working on one with the bottom completely covered (like working in bed) or using graphic intensive apps and not checking the temp.\n", "Q: TVHeadEnd on Pi saying \"No input detected\" This is my first time posting on here.

Given that there's no way in vbox to shrink it back (even if the new space was untouched), i created a new vdi with the correct size of 50G and mounted them both in a ubuntu vm.\nNow i think to dd from the \"50TB\" source onto the 50GB target, hoping that dd will stop with error when the target ends, because it is obviously smaller.\nAm i correct in my assumption, or dd will overwrite my smaller target cyclically (which i don't want)?\n\nA: What system do you have installed? If you have installed linux, you can just TAR all files, and move them on other partition.\nMore info here: http://tuxilero.blogspot.cz/2014/02/linux-backup-your-linux-installation.html\nBack to dd. DD should stop when the target is out of space. But I think it will corrupt its MBR.\nMaybe you should download gparted, and resize the partition?\nIf I were you, I would try to avoid dd for different size partitions...\n\nA: Short answer:\nJust leave your 50 TB VDI as it is, and enjoy it's versatility.\nLong answer and explanation:\nWe can use dd to clone a drive bit by bit until we get an I/O error when the destination drive is full. We can also just copy a certain amount of data by using bs and count options of dd but doing any of these will not give you the desired result.\nYou almost certainly had your 50TB disk defined as a dynamically growing disk, and you probably made your new 50 GB dynamical too. By using dd on these drives you will actually access them. This means that in case you have unused but non-zero data blocks in your VDI there is a risk that both disks will physically grow up to the size of 50 GB.\nTo avoid this we should better just copy the files from the huge drive to the smaller drive, and restore the boot sector after that.\nBut even this may not be needed, as your virtual 50TB hard drive is only virtually of that huge size. It will only then need more physical space than your 50 GB drive after you indeed stored more than 50 GB of data there. Then you may find it even convenient to not have to grow the disk to be able to continue to use it.\n", "Q: Ubuntu doesn't work on my mac, what can I do? i need some help with a macbook.

I have installed refit, and I plugged my External HD on her computer. When turned  on the computer, I selected the penguin Icon,and with all my surprise It didn't work. There was written no bootable disk . Therefore I thought there was a problem with the partition of her computer, so on the main page of refit I selected partition tool I followed the instructions. \nWhen the program finished to repair partitions, I restarted the computer, and tried again to open linux. This time there was a different written no system disk. I can't understand why it happens only in her computer, because in mine it works well. \nAlso when I start the computer, on the main page of refit, next to apple icon, there is a square icon, black and grey where there is written boot legacy ox HD what does it means? please I need some help. Should I erase the whole computer's hardisk, and install all things all over again??? or there is a easier way??\nthanks :)\n\nA: The tool that you believed \"repaired\" the disk in fact created a hybrid MBR. This is a dangerous hack that Apple uses to help support dual-boot configurations of OS X and Windows. Although hybrid MBRs are required in some configurations, they're overused, and playing with them without understanding them is like giving a toddler a flamethrower. I've seen far too many reports of people who've trashed their systems because of hybrid MBR weirdness. I strongly recommend that you read the page I linked to earlier so that you'll be better able to understand the risks and avoid figuratively burning your disk to the ground.\nAlthough it's possible to boot Linux in BIOS mode on a Mac by using a hybrid MBR, IMO it's generally better to boot in EFI mode without using a hybrid MBR. My Web page on this topic provides information on doing this, but it's a bit outdated and it uses a very old Mac as a reference. It's actually easier to get working with some more modern Macs, but the procedure is somewhat different, and I don't have a reference to documentation on doing it.\nThe icon you describe in your last paragraph is a generic icon for launching a BIOS-mode OS from rEFIt. It appears because rEFIt believes it's found an unknown bootable BIOS-mode OS on the hard disk. It might or might not have done so. Chances are it appeared because you created a hybrid MBR on the disk, and chances are that hybrid MBR is doing nothing useful.\nAs to your main problem, booting external disks on Macs has always been a hit-or-miss proposition, especially in BIOS mode. It's likely that your sister's Mac's firmware just doesn't work for this job. You might have better luck by upgrading from the no-longer-maintained rEFIt to my fork of it, rEFInd, which supports booting Linux kernels (3.3.0 and later) in EFI mode. In fact, if you know what you're doing, you should be able to install rEFInd on the external disk so that it will launch on any Mac when you hold down the Option key and select the external disk when you power on the computer. To do this, you'll need to install rEFInd to the external disk's EFI System Partition (ESP) as EFI/BOOT/bootx64.efi. (That's likely gibberish to you now. If you read the rEFInd documentation and my page on EFI boot loaders for Linux you should better understand how to do it.) In any event, once rEFInd is running, it should be able to detect and launch Linux on your external disk without using GRUB or relying on the hackish BIOS-mode tricks that you're using now to launch Linux.\n", "Q: If I create a partition, will it delete all of my files? I am running windows 8 on my SSD, and I also have a 2TB HDD.  I want to install Ubuntu on the HDD, but I have all of my programs and files on that drive, and am worried that I will lose them all if I create Ubuntu partitions.\n\nA: You can create NEW partition on unallocated space. So first of all, you must resize your partition you have on that disc (to a smaller one) .\nThen you will have unallocated space, where you can safely create NEW partition for your linux. \nYou can use gparted in linux, or some windows alternative (partition magic for example).\n\nA: just make defragmentation to your HDD then delete some space you need for your ubuntu ,30Gb is good enough , then in ubuntu installation make a swap partition 2gb then choose the options \"use all the free space\"\n", "Q: Can't get internet working in Ubuntu 12.04 guest virtual box I cannot get internet working at my work place, may be because of proxy.

I downloaded Scid from the software center, as far as I know, everything we download from the center should be an apt package, thus it should be detectable by the system.\nHowever, scid is not listed in the menu of installed apps, the default application finder does not find it, nor Synapse, they find everything but Scid. Why?\n\nA: The scid package doesn't have a .desktop file according to this. The applications which present you with a menu of installed apps generate that menu from the .desktop files present on your system in the /usr/share/applications/ or in the ~/.local/share/applications/ directory. If a program doesn't have a .desktop file in one of those directories it won't show up in the menu.\nThis is by design. There are a lot of programs (mostly terminal based ones) which shouldn't show up in the graphical menu. If you want this program to show up in the application menu you can make a .desktop file for it.\nAlso if you feel that this program is that kind of program which should automatically install a .desktop file for itself you may file a bug report.\n\nA: First off, the Ubuntu Software Centre and the Package Manager are two separate things - there are some programs that belong to both, but not everything does. (For the most part, for instance, if something can be paid for in USC, it's not going to be available in one of the repositories)\nIn the specific case of scid, it is indeed an apt package, but just because that is the case, doesn't mean that it will necessarily install a shortcut to the Dash when you download it. You do, however, have a couple of alternatives for running it:\n\n\n*\n\n*Run from a terminal, as you already have, by opening up a terminal and typing scid;\n\n*Open the run prompt by pressing Alt + F2, and type scid there;\n\n*Create your own shortcut to put in the Dash.\n\n\nThis last one can be done quite easily using the alacarte program. Type sudo apt-get install alacarte into a terminal. Once it has installed, type alacarte to open.\nOnce it has opened, click the \"New Item\" button on the right. As a command you should type scid, for the name you type whatever you want to call the shortcut (most likely Scid.) In addition, you can choose a custom icon by clicking the small box in the top-left of the properties prompt. As a suggestion, you can use for example one of the images in /usr/share/scid/html/bitmaps - if you browse there you will see a series of icons representing each chess piece (more generally speaking, you should be able to choose pretty much any image to go here, but you will want it to be something small for an icon). Click OK, close Alacarte and your new shortcut should be in the Dash now.\nIf you want to edit the entry you have created later on, open alacarte again. Your shortcut will be in the \"Other\" section to the left of the window.\n", "Q: Is it possible to \"trick\" PPA's to think you have installed 12.10 while actually running 12.04?

Before running sudo apt-get update, I would open the /etc/apt/sources.list.d, and look for a file who's title resembles the ppa you added. As a root user, open the file with your favorite text editor, and replace all instances of the word precise, with quantal. Then, run sudo apt-get update, and install your desired packages.

Earlier version will, but wrong resolution I have a Dell XPS M1210, with VESA: G72 Board - bali1 graphics. I'm running Ubuntu 12.04, and my updates are current. I don't know a lot about computers or Linux. I use Linux because I like the open source model, and because it's essentially free. I can't afford to buy a new computer at this time.\nThis problem began with a system freeze. I had to force a shut down by holding down the power button. Since then, when I restart the computer, it fails to boot into the latest version of the OS (Ubuntu with Linux 3.5.0-45-generic, as noted in the title of this thread.) While starting up, a bunch of text flashes by, which I assume to be BIOS. There seem to be some error messages, but they go by too quickly to catch. The process eventually comes to a point where all I have on my screen is a flashing cursor in the upper right corner. At this point, I have only found two ways to proceed. One is to hold the power button to get the computer to shut down. the other is to press the power button for maybe half a second. If I do this, some more text flashes by. It's on the screen long enough for me to catch the last couple lines, which say:\nload fallback graphics device [fail]  \nwill now halt\n\nThen, the computer shuts down.\nWhen I restart it, I get the GRUB screen, which allows me to select to boot into an older version of the OS. If I select the immediately previous version, Ubuntu with Linux 3.5.0-44-generic, the system does boot fully. However, the display resolution is wrong. You'll have to forgive me for not knowing what the correct resolution is, but the one my system boots into is obviously wrong, or, at least it's not the one I'm used to using. If I go to the system settings, and try to adjust the resolution to what I think it should be, I have only two options for resolution where I'm used to seeing more. The two that I have are 1024x768, and 800x600. Neither seems correct to me.\nIs this a graphics problem? Is it repairable? Any help at all would be greatly appreciated.\n\nA: I ran into the same problem today, with exactly the same symptoms. It turned out to be an nvidia version conflict.

Psensor shows that the GPU (with NVidia drivers) is thirty-something degrees and the CPU is about the same, so it's not just down to Linux somehow being more processor-intensive. \nI've read that the BIOS controls the fans under Linux, which makes sense given the high fan speeds when in BIOS as well. It's under Windows, when the ASUS AI Suite 3 software seems to take control, that the system runs more quietly and only speeds the fans up when required. So is there a Linux app which offers a similar dynamic control of the fans, or a setting hidden somewhere in the ASUS BIOS which allows the same but regardless of the OS?\nEDIT - I've tried using lm-sensors and fancontrol, but pwmconfig tells me \"There are no pwm-capable sensor modules installed\". This is after the sensors-detect command does find an 'Intel digital thermal sensor', and despite the sensors working fine in apps like psensor. Help getting this to work would likely solve the problem.\n\nA: The Asus Z87-A has a Nuvoton NCT6791D SuperIO chip to read temperatures and fan speeds and control the fans.

Wubi automatically creates equal size virtual disks for root and usr.\nFurther more, it seems that no matter the size of the \"partition\" I allocate for wubi installation, it will always create 2 virtual disks of no more than 4 GB max for root and 4 Gb max for usr. I tried it on a 16 GB install, and then allocated more than 16 GB but wubi won't have more than 4GB for root and another 4 GB for usr virtual disk which seems to be the maximum limit for a wubi installation.\nI use fat32 partition when installing ubuntu from windows but i don't think this is the reason I can't get a 6GB or more for the usr virtual disk. It would have been much better to have a single larger virtual disk for both root and usr, and a separate virtual disk for for home. Is there a workaround for this problem?\nI know many people don't like wubi but I do, and I hope you'll keep it alive because it is truly a nice and unique piece of software and a good reason for average users like me to give ubuntu a chance, and use ubuntu without having to repartition hdd for a standard installation (tried it twice in the past and was unhappy because i could not shutdown windows as usual, had to actually press the button for complete power off).\nThanks for reading this, and I hope there is an answer for my question. \nAll the best to you all, ubuntu developers and fans!\n\nA: FAT32 file systems have an upper limit on the file size. It's 4GB. That's why Wubi splits the install into separate 4GB .disk files. The maximum install is 12GB with separate root.disk, usr.disk and home.disk.\nHowever, a 4GB limit on /usr is pretty much useless these days. \nMy advice - reformat the partition as NTFS and then install whatever size you want (up to 30GB). Or better, if you're already formatting a partition - use it for a normal dual boot and drop Wubi.\n", "Q: How to make \"Search on Google\" available in selected text's context menu in gnome-terminal?

Of what importance and advantage are they in linux?\n\nA: Logical volume management is a widely-used technique for deploying logical rather than physical storage. \nWith LVM, \"logical\" partitions can span across physical hard drives and can be resized (unlike traditional ext3 \"raw\" partitions). \nA physical disk is divided into one or more physical volumes (Pvs), and logical volume groups (VGs) are created by combining PVs.\nYou should read some more specified info here at The Linux Logical Volume Manager \nThis picture pretty much sums it up\n\nAlso there's some good information at A Beginner's Guide To LVM\nOne of the big advantages of LVM is that you can most easily reduce the size of one partition, and use it on other partitions for example, without data loss.\nYou can also allocate minimal amounts of space for each logical volume and leave some of the disk unallocated. Then, when the partitions start to fill up, they can be expanded as necessary. \nFrom Archlinux wiki:\nAdvantages\nLVM gives you more flexibility than just using normal hard drive partitions:\n\n\n*\n\n*Use any number of disks as one big disk.\n\n*Have logical volumes stretched over several disks.\n\n*Create small logical volumes and resize them \"dynamically\" as they get more filled.\n\n*Resize logical volumes regardless of their order on disk. It does not depend on the position of the LV within VG, there is no need to ensure surrounding available space.\n\n*Resize/create/delete logical and physical volumes online. File systems on them still need to be resized, but some support online resizing.\n\n*Online/live migration of LV being used by services to different disks without having to restart services.\n\n*Snapshots allow you to backup a frozen copy of the file system, while keeping service downtime to a minimum.\nDisadvantages\n\n\n*\n\n*Linux exclusive (almost). There is no official support in most other OS (FreeBSD, Windows..).\n\n*Additional steps in setting up the system, more complicated.\n\n*If you use the Btrfs file system, its Subvolume feature will also give you the benefit of having a flexible layout. In that case, using the additional Abstraction layer of LVM may be unnecessary.\nLVM on Archlinux\n", "Q: How to install Blender 2.6 on Ubuntu 13.10 I'm a newbie to Ubuntu.

If you want to enable DNS cache, install pdnsd and resolvconf.\n\nA: Install nscd using the following command if not yet\nsudo apt-get install nscd\n\nFlush DNS Cache in Ubuntu by restarting the nscd \nsudo /etc/init.d/nscd restart\n\n\nA: Ubuntu 18.04\nUbuntu 17.04 and onwards use systemd for DNS.\nsudo systemd-resolve --flush-caches\n\n", "Q: Sanity check on users created via apt-get install Running apt-get install on a given package may result in users being added to the system.\nIs there an easy way to verify (before installing the package), which users would be added and with what characteristics?

From an administrators point of view (Tools, Services, Commands, way of working, thinking and accessing) What differs from working with Ubuntu on the Clouds and working on a Dedicated server or VPS\n\nA: It does take a slightly different mindset to manage a cloud based Ubuntu server.\n\n\n*\n\n*When you need to reboot, you want to make sure that don't accidentally do a shutdown instead (sudo shutdown vs. sudo shutdown -r). After all, powering-on a cloud server is more complicated than walking over to the rack and pressing the power button.\n\n*You need to think about the server's dependencies, and make sure that the applications and services on it have a high degree of fault tolerance.  That way if your building's internet connection is spotty or goes down, the cloud server isn't going to fill up the logs with errors because it can't reach the database server sitting under your desk.\n\n*You need to be more vigilant about security.  At one job I was told to SSH out to the cloud Ubuntu server as \"root.\"  When I expressed my shock, the response that I got was \"we all log in as root.\"  Obviously, the first thing I did was create individual accounts for everyone, and educate them on how to use \"sudo.\"\n\n*Along the same lines of thought as user security, you will also want to make sure you only open ports that need to be opened.  After all, if you can see/use a port, so can everyone else.  This is a good idea to do anyway, but I have noticed some admins get lax on port maintenance for internal servers.\n\n*When you run any kind of maintenance plan, it's a good idea to script-out and double/triple check your commands.  Again, if something you do turns the server into a paperweight, doing a reinstall/repair can be more complicated in the cloud.\n\n", "Q: My laptop Enable Wireless got greyed out ,not able to use wireless I have been using the same 12.04 precise version Kernel Linux -3.5.4-generic \nLaptop make -lenovo B460 \nas some how (may be because of repeated requests to connect to a wireless connection) I cancel that and after than enable wireless got disabled\nI have tried all options given in this forum \nwhile booting up -the wireless button is active ,but later it got disabled\nI have also tried rfkill option also , when I try iwconfog wlan0 -it shows device does not exists \nall other the Laptop function + other keys are working (scroll lock , display off) only wireless on/off key is not working loooks like OS has stop recognizing wireless card \nThis is my first query ,as past queries were resolved by looking in to history only\nIt will be a great help\nregards \nsudo lshw -C network output \n*-network               \n       description: Ethernet interface\n       product: AR8131 Gigabit Ethernet\n       vendor: Qualcomm Atheros\n       physical id: 0\n       bus info: pci@0000:03:00.0\n       logical name: eth0\n       version: c0\n       serial: f0:de:f1:2d:1f:89\n       size: 100Mbit/s\n       capacity: 1Gbit/s\n       width: 64 bits\n       clock: 33MHz\n       capabilities: pm msi pciexpress vpd bus_master cap_list ethernet physical tp 10bt 10bt-fd 100bt 100bt-fd 1000bt-fd autonegotiation\n       configuration: autonegotiation=on broadcast=yes driver=atl1c driverversion=1.0.1.0-NAPI duplex=full ip=192.168.2.2 latency=0 link=yes multicast=yes port=twisted pair speed=100Mbit/s\n       resources: irq:44 memory:f2400000-f243ffff ioport:2000(size=128)\n  *-network DISABLED\n       description: Wireless interface\n       product: BCM4313 802.11bgn Wireless Network Adapter\n       vendor: Broadcom Corporation\n       physical id: 0\n       bus info: pci@0000:04:00.0\n       logical name: eth1\n       version: 01\n       serial: ac:81:12:16:64:ad\n       width: 64 bits\n       clock: 33MHz\n       capabilities: pm msi pciexpress bus_master cap_list ethernet physical wireless\n       configuration: broadcast=yes driver=wl0 driverversion=6.20.155.1 (r326264) latency=0 multicast=yes wireless=IEEE 802.11abg\n       resources: irq:17 memory:f2500000-f2503fff\n\nOutput of lspci\n00:00.0 Host bridge: Intel Corporation Core Processor DRAM Controller (rev 18)\n00:02.0 VGA compatible controller: Intel Corporation Core Processor Integrated Graphics Controller (rev 18)\n00:16.0 Communication controller: Intel Corporation 5 Series/3400 Series Chipset HECI Controller (rev 06)\n00:1a.0 USB controller: Intel Corporation 5 Series/3400 Series Chipset USB2 Enhanced Host Controller (rev 05)\n00:1b.0 Audio device: Intel Corporation 5 Series/3400 Series Chipset High Definition Audio (rev 05)\n00:1c.0 PCI bridge: Intel Corporation 5 Series/3400 Series Chipset PCI Express Root Port 1 (rev 05)\n00:1c.1 PCI bridge: Intel Corporation 5 Series/3400 Series Chipset PCI Express Root Port 2 (rev 05)\n00:1c.3 PCI bridge: Intel Corporation 5 Series/3400 Series Chipset PCI Express Root Port 4 (rev 05)\n00:1d.0 USB controller: Intel Corporation 5 Series/3400 Series Chipset USB2 Enhanced Host Controller (rev 05)\n00:1e.0 PCI bridge: Intel Corporation 82801 Mobile PCI Bridge (rev a5)\n00:1f.0 ISA bridge: Intel Corporation Mobile 5 Series Chipset LPC Interface Controller (rev 05)\n00:1f.2 SATA controller: Intel Corporation 5 Series/3400 Series Chipset 4 port SATA AHCI Controller (rev 05)\n00:1f.3 SMBus: Intel Corporation 5 Series/3400 Series Chipset SMBus Controller (rev 05)\n00:1f.6 Signal processing controller: Intel Corporation 5 Series/3400 Series Chipset Thermal Subsystem (rev 05)\n03:00.0 Ethernet controller: Qualcomm Atheros AR8131 Gigabit Ethernet (rev c0)\n04:00.0 Network controller: Broadcom Corporation BCM4313 802.11bgn Wireless Network Adapter (rev 01)\nff:00.0 Host bridge: Intel Corporation Core Processor QuickPath Architecture Generic Non-core Registers (rev 05)\nff:00.1 Host bridge: Intel Corporation Core Processor QuickPath Architecture System Address Decoder (rev 05)\nff:02.0 Host bridge: Intel Corporation Core Processor QPI Link 0 (rev 05)\nff:02.1 Host bridge: Intel Corporation Core Processor QPI Physical 0 (rev 05)\nff:02.2 Host bridge: Intel Corporation Core Processor Reserved (rev 05)\nff:02.3 Host bridge: Intel Corporation Core Processor Reserved (rev 05)\n\nOutput of \nrfkill unblock all ( bcmrwl is coming as I have tried other solutions)\n0: ideapad_wlan: Wireless LAN\n    Soft blocked: no\n    Hard blocked: yes\n1: ideapad_bluetooth: Bluetooth\n    Soft blocked: no\n    Hard blocked: yes\n2: phy0: Wireless LAN\n    Soft blocked: no\n    Hard blocked: no\n3: brcmwl-0: Wireless LAN\n    Soft blocked: no\n    Hard blocked: no\n\n\nA: did you verify that your wifi is not disabled by hardware switch/keyboard shortcut (Example F2)?

The libfreefem variation\non the other hand reads fine. So\napt-get install libfreefem++-dev\n\nIn addition\napt-cache search lapack\n\noffers a lot, the most promising looking lines being\nliblapack-dev - library of linear algebra routines 3 - static version\nliblapack3gf - library of linear algebra routines 3 - shared version\n\nthe first package of which I installed.

The bottom line for those who might read this at a later time and with a similar problem: I went to the LAPACK homepage, downloaded the most recent version of LAPACK as a tar gz, unpacked it and followed the instructions issued on installation guide on the same site. Trouble I ran into: In the Makefile I had to reduce the line\nall: lapack_install lib blas_testing lapack_testing\n\nto\nall: lapack_install lib\n\nAfter that\nmake\n\ngave me ./liblapack.a and ./libtmglib.a.\nSo much so Fortran.

You'll only understand my question if you have used Windows and Windows repair disk before. That disc repairs everything automatically, almost no command line, no debugging, nothing. You just create the disk, and if you ever messed up your system, it repairs everything automatically.\nOn the Linux side, we have boot repair disk, which is awesome but it repairs grub only.\nLets say I messed up my Desktop environment, or something, is there there a tool to check what I needs to be fixed and fix it automatically.\nI'm asking this question because I encounter so many issues and it would be nice if there's an automated way to fix them.\n\nA: The problem with Windows is the following:\nOne issue in one simple part of the system can mess up everything else. The network stack issue can be reflected in weird behaviour of the file manager (explorer), etc.\nWith Linux, everything is more contained, a faulty application may not affect others, everything is keep modulated so if there's an issue, you can fix it accurately.\nSo, no. There isn't a fix-it-all application to fix every and any issue in Linux, ergo Ubuntu. Just read the fine error message (if any), try to describe your problem accurately and you may find a solution.\n\nA: If you're cognizant of where you store your stuff and back it up regularly with something as simple as rsync and an external drive, there's really nothing to keep you from doing a fresh install and being back up and running in under half an hour. \nI wrote a simple script that I use to back up my ~/{Pictures,Videos,Documents,Source} directories to a USB drive, I try and do it once a week or so. I also store all my dotfiles in git, and can get them back with a simple command. One of the things I backup is the output of the command dpkg --get-selections, which I can then feed to dpkg --set-selections, at which point I can simply reinstall all the packages I had installed before the failure. \nThere's really no reason to need a \"Repair Disk\" like you're talking about IMHO.

While in theory you could re-compile all the relevant utilities to look in a new location, any attacker could always just look for strings in those binaries to locate the new file, or use regular expressions to find files with passwd-like contents.\nThe shadow file should be readable only to root (and possibly to a group called shadow). If an attacker has managed to get root access to your system, they have complete control and whether or not they can read your passwd/shadow files is pretty irrelevant at that point.\nThere are conceivably a few situations where having files not in expected places might help, eg if you have a badly-configured web server which lets someone request http://myserver/../../etc/passwd, but in general this sort of indirection will require a lot of work for a minimal security benefit.\n\nA: You cannot just rename these files. A lot of processes and programs will search for them, since this is a standard in Linux systems.  What you can do is to securize your server in the proper way. \n\nA: While it's probably no use to rename the /etc/passwd and /etc/shadow files, if you want added security you might want to look at PAM (pluggable authentication modules) and NSS (Name Service Switch). Like here.\nPAM can be used to add authentication modules that, instead reading their authentication ifnormation from the standard files, read it from an other source, like from ldap or a database. Using it would mean the /etc/shadow can be almost completley eliminated.\nNSS complements PAM by making some of the name resolution (like which groups does this user belongs to) independent from the standard files (/etc/passwd, /etc/groups). Using it would mean your passwd file will potentially only contain a fallback option for root, and nothing more. Using SSH keys to validate root login would also eliminate the need to have a root password inside the shadow file (although it might be desired if the SSH connection breaks).\nAlternatively if you don't want to authenticate your users via a separate database or ldap host, you can also create your own PAM and NSS modules, which read their data from a non-standard file, although I wouldn't recommend this option.\nWhen you want to try to use them never forget to keep some kind of fallback to a known, working authentication layer, otherwise you can lock yourself out of the system, even with root.\nNote that not all applications support PAM (a lot of them do however). NSS however can be used to implement authentication for apps that don't support PAM, and some sites I've read about NSS actually suggest this approach. This however means that the NSS module will supply the (potentially) hashed password to anyone who can access the NSS authentication layer, which is almost always something you want to avoid (it's basically the same as giving non-root read access to the shadow file)! So if you're going this approach always make sure that NSS is only used to provide the user with the basic data (like the contents of /etc/passwd), and PAM is used as the authentication layer.\n\nA: The best thing that would be is \"completely useless\" as you put it. (It doesn't provide an additional hurdle for an intruder)\n/etc/passwd does contain account names, but anybody who has shell access to the system will be able to find them.\n/etc/shadow contains sensitive information (the password hashes) but it is readable for root only. If an intruder managed to get root privileges - well how do you spell disaster?\n\nA: In modern Unices (and Unix-likes, including Ubuntu), /etc/passwd doesn't contain any secrets. Renaming it would be more trouble than it is worth, given how many utilities would have to be rebuilt to look for it in its new location.\n/etc/shadow is another matter, since there are secrets in that file, but renaming it won't help. It's only readable by root, so even if a hacker gets into the system as some other user, that's not enough to get to the file. This is why passwords were taken out of /etc/passwd in the first place: everyone needs to be able to read /etc/passwd, but only root needs to be able to get at the actual passwords, so the passwords were moved to a file that only root could read.\nIf the hacker does get root, then a rename won't save you. A simple recursive grep could give the hacker a list of files in an /etc/shadow-like format, and then the hacker only has to look through them to find the data he wants. You've delayed him by a few hours at most, and probably less: again, not worth the amount of time it would take to modify and recompile all the utilities that depend on /etc/shadow's location.\n", "Q: Resized swap partition - swap space does not change?

I am connecting to a remote server via ssh. I get an access denied message. I have no problems logging in, just the access denied message for that file. I need to edit it to load a compiler. How do I do that? I have very recently started using Xubuntu and ssh, so I would appreciate an easy to follow answer.\n\nA: If you want to load environmental variables from .bashrc, you can use \nsource ~/.bashrc\n\nIf for some reason you want to execute it, you have to change permissions first:\nchmod u+x ~/.bashrc\n\nAfter that, you can execute it with\n~/.bashrc\n\nHowever, it doesn't do that much, as it only initializes your shell options.\n\nA: .bashrc is a file, not a command. The syntax ~/.bashrc attempts to run it as a script, which doesn't work. To edit it, you need to first write the name of an appropriate editor - nano is probably a good choice.\nEdit the file with nano ~/.bashrc (save and exit with ctrl-x), then disconnect and reconnect to activate the changes.\n", "Q: USB and Microcontroller communication problem I am new to the Linux world and am currently using Ubuntu 12.04.

Here are the exact instructions to get it working:\n\n\n*\n\n*Install Autokey through Ubuntu Software (I used the GTK-version, not KDE) or by:\nsudo apt-get install autokey-gtk\n\n\n*Configure one script per key, e.g. for { use this code: keyboard.send_keys(\"<alt_gr>+7\") and set the hotkey to Ctrl+Alt+7 (first set hotkey to 7 then add Ctrl and Alt as modifiers). This at least worked for the most important code-writing keys: { [ ] } \\.\n\n*Add autokey to Startup Applications (search for “start” to find it) and then add a program with “autokey” as the command.\n\n\nThis solution will work for anything running in the current X-session (I think) but will not work if you start a new terminal session using Ctrl+Alt+(F2-F6).\n", "Q: How to put availabe disk space into filename?

Isn't this kernel (EOL) END OF LIFE. \n\nA: I think the answer needs to be split in two parts:\n\n\n*\n\n*why 3.11 and not 3.10 or 3.12?\n\n*why choosing an End of Life release?\n\n\nThe answer to the first question is that backported kernels (newer kernels not released in the initial Ubuntu 12.04 release) are, at the moment, backported from newer Ubuntu releases (12.10, 13.04, 13.10, etc) and not from any possible kernel release.\nThis can be seen reading informations provided in the LTS enablement stack page, especially looking at the ending upgrade policy diagram, and looking at the \"Version Matrix\" section of the Extended stable kernels page. As can be see the versions match the 12.10, 13.04 and 13.10 ones. Quite surely also the 14.04 kernel will be backported to a future 12.04 point release.\nAs for why they chose an End of Life release, I think that's because 3.11 was what Ubuntu developers thought was the most appropriate kernel release to have support for recent hardware, as non LTS releases are more about \"new features\" and \"recent hardware support\" rather than stability. Also I think that \"longterm\" kernel releases are selected to be such only after their initial release, not in advance as Ubuntu does. For example kernel 3.10, released on 30 June 2013, was selected as a longterm supported kernel only on 4 August 2013. That means Ubuntu developers do not know if a kernel they choose will be longterm supported or not, unless they choose an already proclaimed \"longterm supported\" release.\n\nA: Perhaps \"end of line\". There was a vast increase of numbering of the Linux kernel releases since 2.6. The 3.11 line is a stable Kernel and it is relatively young. \nstable:     3.11.10 [EOL]   2013-11-29\n\nThis also doesn't mean that you use an old kernel. For distributions it is more important to have a stable system. There are also a lot of packages which have to be customized for new kernels, so they probably wouldn't work with the latest stable release.\n", "Q: Display problem with TeX codes in browsers After unsuccessfully installing latex packages thmtools under gnome environment on my work station, mainly because of lack of root access, I keep receiving the following error in displays of equations in any browsers\nFailed to parse(unknown function '\\begin')\n\nI am looking for an easy solution, without invoking the operations required root access.\n\nA: I will not ask why you do not have root access to your workstation.\nIf you want to have it installed from the repository, somebody has to have and needs to run \nsudo apt-get install texlive-latex-extra\n\nwhere the package thmtools is found. \nBut I fail to see how that alone would enable you to see LaTeX-rendered equations in browsers unless using MathJax or something similar.\n\nEdit\nAt least on Chemistry.SE, the array environment \\begin{array} has to be escaped with a leading backslash:\\\\begin{array}.

It says for the best results make sure your computer has 4.5gb of space, plugged in, connected to the internet. Of which i am on all of those. But when i go to click continue. It does absolutely nothing. I get stuck with the spinning wheel like its trying to do something, even though it is doing nothing. My laptop recently pretty much crashed on me. I can't load windows anymore. I do believe its not even on the hard drive anymore. Anyways. Im having this problem, i literally have looked everywhere i can to find an answer, and got no where. Its really annoying. My desktop is so god damn slow. Please someone have an answer for me.\n\nA: I had the same problem.\nInstallation was stopped in the end, at grub.\nI tried 20 times from downloading from  the official www.ubuntu.com but every time it failed.\nI finally tried an older download (he download it one month before i tried ) from a friend's CD and i finally installed it.\nThe first files that was online were good but from November until today something is wrong in this files. I download it first time in August i think and tried again in November.\nI think that the problem is at the ubuntu .iso .\nThe size of my friends iso was 708 MB and mine (November edition) was 700 MB\nGood Luck with this :)\n", "Q: Second hard drive seems to randomly freeze or unmount I tracing down a problem with a second hard drive and am now stumped.  \nMy setup:  Dell Inspiron 17R-5721, 8GB Ram, running Ubuntu 13.10, Primary drive is Kingston 120GB SSD, secondary drive is a Seagate ST1000LM024 HN-M installed in the CDROM tray.  \nI run a VMWare workstation stored completely on the Seagate drive.  Everything was working fine until about 4 weeks ago.  Now VMWare comes up with a NVRam error and the vitual machine hangs because it can't write to the disk.  I get a corrupted vmdk file and the virtual machine is damaged beyond repair.\nWhen the virtual machine is running and the error hits, the secondary drive seems unresponsive.  I try to use the host Ubuntu system to browse the files using Nautilus on the secondary drive and the drive doesn't respond for 4-5 seconds.  It seems like it was either unmounted and needs time to remount or something to where the Ubuntu OS is waiting on the drive.  For example, Nautilus has the \"Loading...\" status in the bottom right of the window.  I think the failure is in the connection of the drive and not VMWare nor the drive hardware.  \nI've checked the SMART status of the drive and all is okay.  No bad sectors or any other warnings.  I've even reformatted the drive.  I played with the mount options of the drive and have had the same problem.  \nSince the drive doesn't seem to be failing, I don't think replacing it is going to fix the problem.  \nEdit: \nAs for the drive power management: Standby: never, APM level 255, AAM is off, and I've tried to enable and disable write caching.\nAny thoughts on where to look for other clues?\n\nA: \"Any thoughts on where to look for other clues?\"\nThis is likely not the case for you but I once had an XP VM that randomly had an nvram error, and restoring it from a backup I had made just lead to a repeat occurrence. The problem turned out not be the host system but just a bad set of vm files. Cloning the virtual hard drive in a non-sector based manner and restoring it to the hard drive of a new blank vm solved the problem for me. Are you having this problem with a single vm or multiple, as that will tell you whether it's related to host storage problem.\n", "Q: Which Graphics divers should I use? I'm on Xubuntu 13.10 64 bit. The output of lspci, lspci | less, and lspci -v is here.\nUbuntu tells me that there are 3 video cards drivers compatible with my PC. By default Xubuntu picked the first one.\n\nBut which one of these 3 is the best? Which one should I use?\n\nA: The open source drivers are fully supported by Ubuntu and provide support for older hardware which the proprietary drivers have abandoned. In my experience they are also more stable and less prone to random bugs and glitches (Unity randomly failing to start etc), although other people's experiences may vary.\nThe proprietary fglrx drivers on the other hand tend to support the very latest hardware before the open-source drivers have time to catch up, and provide much better 3D performance which is critical for games (although the performance is often still much worse than on Windows). Until recently they also implemented much better power management although this may no longer be the case following the recent radeon DPM changes.\nIf the open-source driver works fine for you, stick with it — there is no need to switch to fglrx just for the sake of it. If you want to play modern 3D games on Ubuntu however, or your graphics performance is very poor and you have a latest-generation GPU, you are probably better off with fglrx.\n", "Q: Certification validation issues with ppa So I just installed ubuntu on my computer at work and when I try to add a ppa I get the following message:\nCannot add PPA: '\"Error reading https://launchpad.net/api/1.0/~libreoffice/+archive/ppa: (60, 'server certificate verification failed.

Basically, you will make your partitions manually.\nWhen you make your partition:\nMount your 16Gb as /\nMount around 4Gb of your 100 Gb partition as Swap\nMount the remaining 96 Gb of this 100 Gb partition as /home\nNormally, 16Gb is more than enough for a normal use of Ubuntu. Now, if you are planing to install A LOT (and I mean really A LOT) of software, games, etc, you may add another partition on your 100 Gb, which you will mount as /usr. I would not suggest you to do this, because it may make your system slower, as all your apps will be on a mechanical HD.

I used the Windows Partition Manager to shrink the main partition by 400 GB.  The tool froze before confirming completion, but when I re-executed it, everything looked as expected.  I then rebooted the system three times to make sure Windows was feeling good about the smaller hard drive.\nI then booted to the Ubuntu 13.10 Live CD to use the installer tool.  I was greeted with the system acknowledging that an OS existed, so I selected to install alongside.  Ubuntu produced an uniterpretable error that literally read: ???? ????.  I clicked OK, and the install tool  now only gives the option to erase disk or something else.\nI decided to open GParted to get an idea of what was going on, and it continues to get hung up on Searching /dev/mapper/isw_ebffchhbhf_ARRAY partitions.

Any idea what the issue is?\n\nA: Maybe you are using the disk controller in RAID Mode on Windows and Ubuntu can't modify or use this RAID array. Are you using SSD caching or RAID? If you are using SSD Caching, try turning it off on Windows, then try changing the disk controller operating mode from RAID to AHCI on BIOS, boot Windows to check if it's working, then try to install Ubuntu again.\nIf you are using RAID between 2 or more disks, maybe this disk controller uses FakeRAID and Ubuntu doesn't support it.\n\nA: I ended up finding a solution.  It doesn't address my question entirely, but I'm now running Ubuntu and Windows on a dual boot RAID system.\nAfter a ton of reading, I found a thread where someone claimed an easy install using the Alternate CD.  Since Canonical dropped support of the Alternate ISO for 13.10, I decided to go with Precise 12.04 LTS.  It easily installed with the Alternate CD, and GRUB is working flawlessly.  Didn't even need to run boot-repair.\n", "Q: Network Manager breaks manual routes I have Ubuntu 13.10, Saucy Salamander x64 running as a guest in VirtualBox (with Windows 7 as a host).\nI wrote this /etc/network/interfaces because I need to add a large number of permanent, manual static routes:\n# interfaces(5) file used by ifup(8) and ifdown(8)\nauto lo\niface lo inet loopback\n\nauto eth0\niface eth0 inet dhcp\n\nauto eth1\niface eth1 inet dhcp\n    up ip -force -b /etc/network/eth1-routes\n\neth1-routes contains several lines of the form:\nroute add 10.0.0.0/8 via 172.x.x.x dev eth1\n\nwhere 172.x.x.x is the gateway that VBox NAT gives me.\nBy running netstat -nr it appears that all of my manual routes have been successfully added, including routes to get to two DNS servers via 172.x.x.x.\nHowever, network manager says that both devices are \"not managed\". If I set /etc/NetworkManager/NetworkManager.conf managed=true, network manager works again but my routes are lost. So my current compromise is to set managed=false and comment out the eth0 lines in /etc/network/interfaces.\nIs there a way to have a device be managed and still do manual routes as above?\n\nA: Network Manager manages its own static routes - open network manager and select \"wired connection 1\". Select edit. select IPv4 tab. At the bottom of this page is a button for \"Routes\". That is where you add them. When done NM writes to a file with root permissions in its /etc/NetworkManager/system-connections/ directory called \"Wired connection 1\"\nExample follows\nls -l /etc/NetworkManager/system-connections/\ntotal 4.0K\n-rw------- 1 root root 216 Aug 26 10:38 Wired connection 1\n\nsudo cat /etc/NetworkManager/system-connections/Wired\\ connection\\ 1\n\n[802-3-ethernet]\nmac-address=A:Real:Mac:Add:re:ss\n\n[connection]\nid=Wired connection 1\nuuid=df4491fc-0981-4071-82ae-04c7b2d6d9fc\ntype=802-3-ethernet\n\n[ipv6]\nmethod=auto\n\n[ipv4]\nmethod=auto\nroute1=10.2.2.0/24,10.1.1.68,1\n\nWhere 10.2.2.0 is the destination network and 10.1.1.68 is the gateway.\n\nA: Network Manager does not recognize the statements you wrote in /etc/network/interfaces.\nSo your can add your script eth1-routes as a dispatcher script for Network Manager in /etc/network/if-up.d/. It will be run every time an interface goes up. Maybe you have to write in your script an \"if clause\" to only add the routes if eth1 comes up. Like this:\nif [ \"$IFACE\" == \"eth1\" ]; then\n  route add ...\n  route add ...\nfi\n\n\nA: If you want to add a route to Ubuntu that persists reboot and does not use the default interface as the gateway then you may want to add a route statement to the NetworkManager configuration file for the specific interface.\nAdd a route to the /etc/NetworkManager/system-connections/\"connection name\" configuration file by adding the route statement to the configuration file for (assuming IPv4). The route has four parts; \"the first being the destination IPv4 network or address (network byte order), the second the destination network or address prefix (1 - 32), the third being the next-hop (network byte order) if any, and the fourth being the route metric\".\n[ipv4]\nmethod=auto\nroute1=172.16.0.0/16,192.168.3.1,1\n\nThis is the equivalent of setting the route using the following route statement:\nroute add -net 172.16.0.0 netmask 255.255.0.0 gw 192.168.3.1\n\nThe route keyname is defined in Table 12 in the NetmorkManager developer documentation.

Is there a step I need to do to make this service register or appear properly? (I know on RedHat it's \"chkconfig --add xxx) but I don't know Ubuntu well enough.\n\nA: initctl is part of Uubuntu's upstart mechanism. initctl list only shows you the status of upstart-jobs. Your script is indeed is a SysV init script.\nTo list the status of SysV init script use this command:\nservice --status-all\n\nYour service should be listed there.\n\nTo create links in the /etc/rcN folders use the following command:\nupdate-rc.d your_init_script defaults\n\nFrom the manpage of update-rc.d:\n\nIf defaults is used then update-rc.d will make links to start the\n  service in runlevels 2345 and to  stop  the service in runlevels 016.\n\n", "Q: CIFS VFS: Server xxx has not responded in 120 seconds I am having a problem with a Windows mount that becomes unavailable and hang any process accessing it.\nDoing a dmesg gives this:\n[ 1566.033468] CIFS VFS: Server xxx.xxx.xxx.xx has not responded in 120 seconds.

In Ubuntu Touch on a tablet, can I use apt-get to access Ubuntu repositories with native apps -- and will native Linux apps run in Ubuntu Touch?\n\nA: there is a couple of things to say about that:\n1) apt-get in itself does and will still work. That isnt going away. To the best of my knowledge, you can even still do apt-get update/upgrade to update your packages on touch. However for easier deployment, we now use click packages to deploy apps to touch.\n2) will native apps run on touch? Well that depends. When you mean apps with a GUI then no, most likely not. When they haven’t been built using the Qt/QML sdk for Ubuntu, they wont be environmentally aware enough to function on touch. (Though theoretically you could build an app in (say) C++ without the sdk that would work on touch. It would just be an enormously complicated task)\nSo no: GUI-apps for Desktop Ubuntu in reality just will not run on Touch. The basic difference between Touch and Desktop Ubuntu (at the moment) is that Desktop uses the X display server. All Desktop GUI programs rely on X to render them to screen. Touch does not now and will not have X. A new display server called Mir has been designed for Touch. That brings great advantages compared to X but that means that applications that need X, just will not run on Touch. (Again, this is only for the GUI part of an app). Note also that in the near future, Ubuntu Desktop will also get MIR, but with a fallback to X for apps that don´t do MIR.\nMost Commandline interface programs (like corkscrew for instance) will have no inherent problem with Touch. (Touch is however still under heavy development so it may not work right now.)\nSorry for the lenghty reply. This is however pretty complicated stuff :)\n\nA: I've used \"aptitude\" to update / upgrade 15.04 and ran into some problems. \n\n\n*\n\n*the cache used a lot of space resulting in errors \"ran out of space\"\n\n*some of the main Ubuntu touch components had been removed in the process - leaving the phone useful only in terminal mode but without the touchscreen applications\n3) apt-get6 update seemed to run nicely but after the update the 3G / 2G carrier was not detected anymore . This could be easily solved by changing the carrier mode from 3G to 2G and back again => resulting in a rescan of available carriers - resulting in a working phone again :)\n\n\nso Just a warning ... use apt-get carefully ... the whole system is still in beta and this seems to result in some of these behaviours.\n\nA: Perhaps this is a more relevant askubuntu answer? At least on how to enable apt-get on Ubuntu touch.\nBasically it says to use phablet-tools and configure it\nsudo ap-get install phablet-tools\nphablet-config writable-image\n\n", "Q: BIOS as bootloader I am considering installing Windows next to Ubuntu. Ubuntu is installed on a small-ish ssd, and I would like to keep it clean.\nCan windows be installed on a second hard drive? Can I use the bios as an bootloader, switching between the two bootable drives?\nI have not found anyone using this setup on the internet. There are lots of posts on the impossibilities of installing windows on an external hard dive though.\n\nA: Yes, generally you can tell your bios which drive to boot, though how to do so depends on your bios.  So you can install each OS on its own drive, and change which drive the bios boots to toggle between the two.\n\nA: Yes, technically, Windows can be installed on a second HDD.\nThe BIOS is on a special chip on your computers mobo, so the location won't be changed when you add a new HDD.\nSee, when your computer detects multiple OSs at boot, it'll show a black screen that lets you choose which OS you want to use.\nI don't really understand what you mean by using the BIOS as the bootloader though.\nGood luck.\n", "Q: Arithmetic with variables I am trying to do arithmetic as I assign a variable a value.

To make arithmetics operations this is the format:\n\n$((expression))\n\nSo in your case this would be the right variable assignment:\nexport end_day=$(( $start_day+(((($start_day*24)+84)/24)-((($start_day*24)+84)%24)) ))\nexport end_hour=$(( ($start_day*24+84)%24 ))\n\n\nNOTE: this need to be tested, not sure if results are correct.\n", "Q: Increase storage for Ubuntu (under Virtualbox) I installed Ubuntu in my VM with fixed storage of 16GB.

Ubuntu started up OK, but didn't work well with my wireless at work. So I tried to boot back into Windows and it won't load the bootloader. If I select the SYSTEM part (which contains a loader) it does nothing. If I select to boot from the part I know has the copy of Windows it fails with a C000000F error (File not found). I tried to repair the boot manager using the win7 dvd, but now not even GIMP is showing up. I know I can get GRUB to work again, but I think I have to repair the windows boot loader first. I'm not sure how to do that.\nI know this should probably go in an \"Ask Win7\" SE, but I don't know of one. So if anyone can help me restore windows or point me to a good windows tech forum I'd appreciate it.\nEDIT:\nHere's a little more technical detail. I have an HP laptop that came configured with four drives: SYSTEM, Main, HP_TOOLS, RECOVERY. SYSTEM is what it says it is. It's actually the boot drive that loads the operating system on Main. When I installed grub I put it on SYSTEM thinking that would cause the least amount of confusion to the core boot loader. However, I realized this was a mistake early when I tried to boot to that drive only for grub to reappear. I tried to boot into Main but that caused the 0xC000000F error. I can't find a log that tells me what is causing that error.\nI can (now) boot into Ubuntu just fine. Boot-Loader didn't detect a problem on any of the drives and it didn't fix anything.\nRE-EDIT:\nI should also probably mention that these four drives used to each be primary partitions. I changed HP_TOOLS and RECOVERY to logical partitions. I'm not sure if this is important or not, but something I read somewhere made me think it could make a difference.\n\nA: So despite the lack of information I provided here I finally managed to boot back into Windows by following directions I found here:\nhttp://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_7-system/windows-7-after-grub-bcd-0xc000000f/4a42140a-7ce5-4c53-9c4e-9d5fd6372be9\nIt just starts in Win7 now, but I think I can use EasyBCD from here to get it dual booting.\n", "Q: How can I convert my mp4 files to avi using avconv?

This is not done by default. To force copy streams we may use the option -c as follows:\navconv -i infile.mp4 -c:a copy -c:v copy outfile.avi\n\nOf course only a video encoding supported by the AVI container can be copied this way.\nTo re-encode  the output video we can replace copy by any of supported codecs as listed with an E from\navconv -codecs\n\n", "Q: Is it safe to Defrag Windows 8 while dual booting Ubuntu?

Thank you in advance for the info. \nThanks\n\nA: Is Ubuntu installed on a different partition? if so, windows defrag shouldn't touch the other partition as it works at the filesystem level.\nDefragmentation under Ubuntu is not needed (Why is defragmentation unnecessary?), but if you want to do it, you can google \"defrag ubuntu\" to get some ideas.\n\nA: From the context of the question and the assumption that your experience level is low, this applies if you installed Ubuntu using the wubi (Windows-based installer) which installed to a single file in your Windows partition and is used as a disk image.\nIf this is the case, a Windows defrag will likely either move this file to a more efficient area of the disk (in tact and as a complete file) or it will move the other files around it - whichever will result in less fragmentation.  So no, your Ubuntu install will not be affected.\nRefer to @roadmr's answer for the second part - you do not need to defrag your Ubuntu partition\nFurthermore, if your disk is an SSD, defragmentation is unnecessary regardless of operating system because it is done by the controller automagically.\n\nA: No, this isn't something you need to worry about.\nYour Ubuntu partition uses the EXT4 file system (or possibly EXT3, depending), which Windows cannot read. That is to say, it is in a part of the hard drive that Windows by itself cannot access (Windows only really has support for FAT and NTFS).\nThe defragmentation process isn't too well defined in Ubuntu. It's possible, but most deem it unnecessary, as there just isn't as much fragmentation in EXT filesystems as in NTFS. The way of doing it is to boot using a LiveCD and using GParted to shrink the partition to just above the amount of data present, and then grow it again (basically squashing the data to the start of the partition). But it's not really needed, so I wouldn't worry about it.\n", "Q: unable to download deb packages from a private repo I am trying to setup a private apt repo using this.

But honestly it's probably more work than it's worth.\nInstead your best bet is probably to start over, and use this as an opportunity to upgrade to the latest release. While it may not be your only option, it's likely the quickest reliable solution.\n", "Q: Export Rhythmbox ratings and play counts to ID3 tags Is there a way to export Rhythmbox ratings to id3 tags, or migrate them in some other way?

OK, I know that I am crossing out the most popular choices out there, but there is a reason for that. I am working on a BeagleBone Black running an ultra light version of Ubuntu 13.04 and I currently have it hooked up on the router via Ethernet. I only interact with the BeagleBone through ssh and I like to keep everything on the command line (X is not even installed). Ideally I want to connect to the router wirelessly, through the USB dongle I have attached to it, but:\n\n\n*\n\n*The storage capacity of this microcontroller is limited, therefore the ~250MB of the network manager with its command line tools is a solution that does not \"fit\".\n\n*Wicd seemed like a great alternative. wicd-curses is exactly what I am looking for: a clear and easy to use command line interface, easy to scan for networks, select yours and configure passwords, etc. However, when I try to connect to a network it crashes gloriously and I failed to solve the problem.\n\n*wpa_supplicant does provide what I need, but \"the hard way\", so I want to avoid it, if possible.\n\n\nAre you aware of any other application that can help me connect to my WPA wireless network through command line, without having to configure everything manually?\n\nA: I suggest you do:\nsudo vim /etc/network/interfaces\n\nAdd the wireless stanzas similar to:\nauto lo\niface lo inet loopback\n\n#auto eth0\niface eth0 inet dhcp\n\nauto wlan0\niface wlan0 inet static\naddress 192.168.1.100\nnetmask 255.255.255.0\ngateway 192.168.1.1\nwpa-ssid <your_network>\nwpa-psk <your_secret_key>\ndns-nameservers 8.8.8.8 192.168.1.1\n\nPlease be certain the address is outside the pool used by the DHCP server in the router or access point.

MySpell was written to explore how affix compression can be implemented.\nThe Main features of MySpell are:\nWritten in C++ to make it easier to interface with Pspell, OpenOffice, AbiWord, etc.\n      It is stateless, uses no static variables and should be completely reentrant with almost no ifdefs.\n      It tries to be as compatible with ispell to the extent it can. It can read slightly modified versions of munched ispell dictionaries (and it comes with a munched english wordlist borrowed from Kevin Atkinson's excellent Aspell.\n      It uses a heavily modified aff file format that can be derived from ispell aff files but uses the iso-8859-X character sets only.\n      It is simple with lots of comments that describes how the affixes are stored and tested for (based on the approach used by ispell).\n      It supports improved suggestions with replacement tables and ngram-scoring based mechanisms in addition to the main suggestion mechanisms.\n      Like ispell it has a BSD license (and no advertising clause). \n\n\nGNU Aspell\n\nDocumented Description:\n   GNU Aspell is a spell-checker which can be used either as a standalone application or embedded in other programs.  Its main feature is that it does a\n   much better job of suggesting possible spellings than just about any other spell-checker available for the English language, including Ispell and\n   Microsoft Word.  It also has many other technical enhancements over Ispell such as using shared memory for dictionaries and intelligently handling\n   personal dictionaries when more than one Aspell process is open at once.\n\n\n\n*\n\n*Available Aspell Dictionaries\n\nHunspell\n\nDocumented Description:\n  Hunspell is a spell checker and morphological analyzer library and program designed for languages with rich morphology and complex word compounding or\n   character encoding. It is based on MySpell and features an Ispell-like terminal interface using Curses library, an Ispell pipe interface and an\n   OpenOffice.org UNO module. \nHunspell is the spell checker of LibreOffice, OpenOffice.org, Mozilla Firefox 3 & Thunderbird, Google Chrome, and it is also used by proprietary software packages, like Mac OS X, InDesign, memoQ, Opera and SDL Trados. \nMain features:\n  \n  \n*\n  \n*Unicode support (first 65535 Unicode character) \n  \n*morphological analysis (in custom item and arrangement style) \n  \n*Max. 65535 affix classes and twofold affix stripping (for agglutinative languages, like Azeri, Basque, Estonian, Finnish, Hungarian, Turkish, etc.) \n  \n*Support complex compoundings (for example, Hungarian and German) \n  \n*Support language specific algorithms (for example, handling Azeri and Turkish dotted i, or German sharp s) \n  \n*Handling conditional affixes, circumfixes, fogemorphemes, forbidden words, pseudoroots and homonyms.\n  \n*Interfaces and ports: AndroidHunspellService (for Android, based on the Chromium fork of Hunspell), Enchant (Generic spelling library from the Abiword project), XSpell (Mac OS X port, but Hunspell is part of the OS X from version 10.6 (Snow Leopard), and now it is enough to place the Hunspell dictionary files into ~/Library/Spelling or /Library/Spelling for spell checking), Delphi, Java (JNA, JNI), Perl, .NET, Python, Ruby, UNO, RichEdit.\n  \n\n\nIspell\n\nDocumented Description: \n  International Ispell (an interactive spelling corrector)\n   Ispell corrects spelling in plain text, LaTeX, sgml/html/xml, and nroff files. [x]Emacs and jed have nice interfaces to ispell, and ispell works from\n   many other tools and from the command line as well. \nNo ispell dictionaries are included in this package; you must install at least one of them (\"iamerican\" is recommended by default for no good reason);\n   install the \"ispell-dictionary\" package(s) for the language(s) you and your users will want to spell-check. \nIt's a good idea to install \"word list\" package(s) for the same language(s), because they'll be used by ispell's (L)ookup command.\n\n", "Q: Why isn't window-snap working on Ubuntu 12.04 + gnome shell I am trying to get the window-snap feature to work but cannot.\nI started with Ubuntu 12.04 (installed on a VirtualBox with Windows 7 hosting).

Is there any way to get this simple feature to work?\n\nA: Ok I solved it.

I'm running a 10.04 LTS server and the LTS wiki page shows it as being supported until 2015.\nHowever, on the CVE page for a security vulnerability in libyaml, the table states:\n\nUbuntu 10.04 LTS (Lucid Lynx): ignored (reached end-of-life)\n\nWhy is there a discrepancy here?\n\nA: Ubuntu 10.04 LTS Desktop has reached EOL, while 10.04 LTS Server is still supported. 10.04 was the last LTS release which had different support length for the Desktop and Server versions. Since 12.04 every LTS release is supported for 5 years.\nSo the interesting question is what packages have became unsupported by the EOL of 10.04 LTS Desktop? You can look here where you will find a link to this list of still supported packages. As that list's first line confirms:\n\nLucid source packages not in this list are unsupported starting Apr 29, 2013\n\nlibyaml is not in that list. (How that list was decided I don't know.)\nI feel too the discrepancy when it is said that the LTS Server is still supported, but only a few packages are truly supported. But this was well-known before, that the EOL of the Desktop release will cause a lot of packages to be no more supported. This discrepancy is likely one of the cause why Canonical switched to support every LTS release for 5 years, be it Desktop or Server.\n\nA: Not all packages are supported full time for LTSs. The full support lasts for 24 months. Most desktop pakages are supported for 36 months. After that, only a small subset of packages are maintained because not everyone works for supporting older LTSs.

I'm running xubuntu, and removed xfce from the software manager (face palm) while trying to clear up space (I believe this is what I did since I cant find any trace of xfce in the terminal). At the time it didn't affect anything. When I restart my computer the ubuntu load screen comes on like normal, then the log-in screen.

Also my internet is a wireless network that only works after logging into the internet provider's site, which I'm not sure I can do without a gui. Any ideas or suggestions? \n\nA: One thing you can do is to (use another computer to) download all the packages for xubuntu  that you've uninstalled, from Ubuntu server into a flash drive and boot Ubuntu in the recovery mode (When you see the boot menu, choose the item right below the default item). Then you can install the packages from command line.\nIf you have a cd drive, you can also try apt-cdrom.\nIt's a good idea to have a small partition on your hard drive and install (another copy of) ubuntu to it for the rough days, so in a situation like this you can boot from that partition and repair the main installation/partition.  \n", "Q: make 12.04 look like 10.04, please!

The problem is that since 11.04 is not supported anymore there are probably not any packages for this version. \n\nA: sudo apt-get install package name does a search in launchpad or in repo which is added in source list and installs it.

However, you can't do it from your current operating system, you need to boot into a live environment (like a LiveCD, LiveUSB etc).\nLook for a LiveCD with GParted on it, which is a graphical partition editor.  From there, you can select your partition and shrink it.  You want to backup any critical data on there, in case something goes wrong, and make sure there's enough free space to shrink it to where you want.  Make sure you don't interrupt it once the shrink is in progress or things will be bad.\nI believe every Ubuntu LiveCD has GParted on it. Here you can find GParted Live, which is exactly that; a live environment with nothing but GParted on it.\nGood luck, make sure you look into what you need to do once you've installed the other operating system.  If it's another Linux distribution, it will most likely detect your current one.

I am a new Ubuntu user and find some people tell me to use sudo -i to get root and others tell me to use sudo -s. What is the difference? Which one do I use and when?\n\nA: sudo -i\n\n\n-i [command]\n                 The -i (simulate initial login) option runs the shell speci‐\n                 fied by the password database entry of the target user as a\n                 login shell.  This means that login-specific resource files\n                 such as .profile or .login will be read by the shell.  If a\n                 command is specified, it is passed to the shell for execution\n                 via the shell's -c option.  If no command is specified, an\n                 interactive shell is executed.  sudo attempts to change to\n                 that user's home directory before running the shell.  The\n                 security policy shall initialize the environment to a minimal\n                 set of variables, similar to what is present when a user logs\n                 in.  The Command Environment section in the sudoers(5) manual\n                 documents how the -i option affects the environment in which\n                 a command is run when the sudoers policy is in use.\n\nsudo -s\n\n\n -s [command]\n                 The -s (shell) option runs the shell specified by the SHELL\n                 environment variable if it is set or the shell as specified\n                 in the password database.  If a command is specified, it is\n                 passed to the shell for execution via the shell's -c option.\n                 If no command is specified, an interactive shell is executed.\n\n\nA: The major difference between sudo -i and sudo -s is:\n\n\n*\n\n*sudo -i gives you the root environment, i.e. your ~/.bashrc is ignored.\n\n*sudo -s gives you the user's environment, so your ~/.bashrc is respected.\n\n\nHere is an example, you can see that I have an application lsl in my ~/.bin/ directory which is accessible via sudo -s but not accessible with sudo -i. Note also that the Bash prompt changes as will with sudo -i but not with sudo -s:\ndotancohen@melancholy:~$ ls .bin\nlsl\n\ndotancohen@melancholy:~$ which lsl\n/home/dotancohen/.bin/lsl\n\ndotancohen@melancholy:~$ sudo -i\n\nroot@melancholy:~# which lsl\n\nroot@melancholy:~# exit\nlogout\n\ndotancohen@melancholy:~$ sudo -s\nSourced .bashrc\n\ndotancohen@melancholy:~$ which lsl\n/home/dotancohen/.bin/lsl\n\ndotancohen@melancholy:~$ exit\nexit\n\nThough sudo -s is convenient for giving you the environment that you are familiar with, I recommend the use of sudo -i for two reasons:\n\n\n*\n\n*The visual reminder that you are in a 'root' session.\n\n*The root environment is far less likely to be poisoned with malware, such as a rogue line in .bashrc.\n\n", "Q: When using the same Firefox profile in Ubuntu and Windows, how can I keep settings consistent?

And I know both operating systems (Microsoft Windows 8.1 and Ubuntu 13.10) are working, because I have used them both post-install.\nThe problem is, since I last shutdown the computer from within Ubuntu (via the power menu, nothing special), the computer now hangs on the \"VAIO\" logo... It just sits there doing nothing, and refusing to load GRUB or boot to an operating system.\nThe computer currently has Secure Boot disabled, but has UEFI enabled (changing the latter to \"Legacy\" simply gives a \"No Operating System Found\" error immediately after the \"VAIO\" logo). Furthermore, my computer is currently set to boot from the hard disk first, then removable storage (it was the other way around previously, with the same results).\nAt this stage, the only way I can get past the \"VAIO\" logo is if I boot into the VAIOCare recovery menu via the \"Assist\" button and select the option to boot from removable storage...\nAny help would be appreciated.\n--\nEdit:\nIt works if I use the VAIOCare recovery menu via the \"Assist\" button and select the \"Boot to Windows\" (not the exact wording) option...

With any luck this will fix your problem. If not, you could try using bcdedit in Windows to register rEFInd as the default boot manager, as described in the Windows installation instructions.\n\n*Use the workaround you note to boot to a Linux emergency disk and use that to run the Boot Repair tool. In theory, this will restore GRUB as the default boot manager. If this procedure does not work, and if rEFInd also does not work, post the URL that Boot Repair provides; that will give us details about your setup that may help us find a fix.\n\n\n\nEDIT:\nYour parenthetical statement in your comment to this answer suggests that rEFInd is working. If so, just use it; that's your solution.\nI suspect, though, that you mean that you can boot via rEFInd on the USB flash drive, but that the computer is still not booting from the hard disk. If so, try this:\n\n\n*\n\n*Use rEFInd on the USB drive (or any other means) to boot to Windows.\n\n*In Windows, launch an Administrator Command Prompt window.\n\n*Type bcdedit /set {bootmgr} path \\EFI\\refind\\refind_x64.efi in the Administrator Command Prompt window.\n\n\nWith any luck, when you reboot rEFInd should start up and enable you to boot whatever OS you like.\nAlternatively, you could pass \\EFI\\ubuntu\\shimx64.efi instead of \\EFI\\refind\\refind_x64.efi to bcdedit to get GRUB to show up as your default boot manager.\nIf this doesn't work, I recommend you check with the manufacturer to see if there's a firmware update available, since a failure at this point indicates a serious firmware bug.\nIf a firmware update is not available or doesn't work, then I recommend you return the computer to the manufacturer and buy something else. People are distressingly unwilling to return non-functional computers to the store, but that's the only action that will actually get manufacturers' attention to fix serious problems like this.\n", "Q: Cannot Connect to Internal Network I just got a System76 Gazelle laptop with Ubuntu 13.10.

Then, use unetbootin to burn the DVD to your USB stick.\nAnother way is to go to the website of your manufacturer and find out if they offer recovery images.   Quite often, recovery images will completely overwrite the entire drive with a completely factory image.  \nFinally, there are other sources such as torrents, but the legality and authenticity of these ISOs are questionable.\n\nA: Windows 7 DVDs are not license specific. So if you have a friend that has an original (not vendor specific) windows install DVD, you could ask to borrow it and install windows with your license (sticker on bottom of the laptop usually).\nOtherwise you might have to spend a few bucks to get the system restore DVDs from your laptops manufacturer, they will usually send them to you for a minor fee of a few bucks (maybe 10 or so).\n\nA: \nI wonder if there is a way to download windows7 image to create a cd or usb bootable from ubuntu?\n\nIn Holland we are allowed to download the original software and use a key we purchased (one that is on the sticker on the hardware for instance) but are not allowed to use downloaded registration keys or software that was altered to include the key.\nSo the answer is yes. But you need to find a download on the web of an ISO or of a torrent and ubuntu will happily download the file for you that you can burn on a CD/DVD/BD and can then use to install Windows. \nYou will need to find that file yourself but what is legal in your country is yours to find out.\n\nA: You have to buy the installation disk - e.g. Windows Home Premium @ Currys, which you can only install on a limited amount of computers, and it can be certain versions - e.g. Ultimate, Enterpise, Home Basic, etc. Windows, unlike Ubuntu, is not Open source, and cannot be downloaded and installed legally for free, as least not that easily, and most countries.\nThen you can follow guides like this to install Windows from a USB.\nEdit:\nThe question here has download links.\n", "Q: Unity's \"File Edit View\" menus in Gnome Fallback in Ubuntu 12.04?

I thought by setting the ubuntu's account password (in case it wasn't set) that might start prompting me for a password when using sudo, but when I used the passwd command it required me to enter the original password before allowing me to change it. So, even though it appeared to be set already, it wasn't prompting me for a sudo pass, and after I used sudo to override and change the ubuntu account password, it still is not asking for a sudo pass.\nAnyway, I'm not sure how important those details actually are. Here is my sudoers file:\n#\n# This file MUST be edited with the 'visudo' command as root.\n#\n# Please consider adding local content in /etc/sudoers.d/ instead of\n# directly modifying this file.\n#\n# See the man page for details on how to write a sudoers file.\n#\nDefaults     env_reset\nDefaults     secure_path=\"/usr/local/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/sbin:/usr/bin:/sbin:/bin\"\n\n# Host alias specification\n\n# User alias specification\n\n# Cmnd alias specification\n\n# User privilege specification\nroot    ALL=(ALL:ALL) ALL\n\n# Members of the admin group may gain root privileges\n%admin ALL=(ALL) ALL\n\n# Allow members of group sudo to execute any command\n%sudo   ALL=(ALL:ALL) ALL\n\n# See sudoers(5) for more information on \"#include\" directives:\n\n#includedir /etc/sudoers.d\n\nIn all the examples I've come across where people didn't know why they had passwordless sudo setup, it seemed to be because of some sort of explicit \"NOPASSWD:ALL\" line in the sudoers file (which mine doesn't have). I tried doing:\n%admin ALL:(ALL) PASSWD: ALL\n\nbut it didn't help.\nid output:\nuid=1000(ubuntu) gid=1000(ubuntu) groups=1000(ubuntu),4(adm),20(dialout),24(cdrom),25(floppy),29(audio),30(dip),44(video),46(plugdev),110(netdev),111(admin)\n\n\nA: The ubuntu user makes me think that this is some kind of a live environment. In the live environment the ubuntu user has passwordless sudo access, because that is the purpose of the live environment. \nIn the above case the passwordless sudo access is defined in a file in the /etc/sudoers.d/ directory, more exactly the /etc/sudoers.d/casper contains this:\nubuntu  ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD: ALL\n\nSo I think you have such a file in the /etc/sudoers.d/ directory.

Select the Install Ubuntu line and press E to edit boot options, and add the \"nomodeset\" kernel option. Then boot the installer\n3 When asked for installation options, select Something Else and chose the free partition that you have created in step 1, and make sure you select to install the boot loader in that partition, not in the whole disk or other places. \nAlso stablish a wifi connection to do upgrades on the fly.\n4 When finishing the installation, go to BIOS and select Ubuntu loader as  the first boot option. Save changes and exit and you will appear in the ubuntu grub menu (you will also see that windows is still on offer,  and it still works BTW). Edit the Ubuntu boot line and add the nomodeset option again (last time you need it)\n5 ubuntu will boot and login in graphics mode, but still at low resolution and no access to nvidia board whatever you do (I tried both nvidia-prime and bumblebee a lot of times). Do not try any of them yet, just go to next step:\n6 Install the  64bits  kernel of the day (I used  3.16.0-994-generic ) and also its linux headers. I used the standard software installation tool for that. It is easy and you can find a lot of tutorials about it on google, so I will not bother with more details. This is a key step, as recent kernels seem to solve several critical problems with this laptop.\n7 After installing the kernel then reboot (but do not add the nomodeset option anymore! ). Now it will login in a nice fullHD layout for the first time. You will also notice that the keyboard backlight is working fine. But no nvidia acceleration yet.\n8 Now install Bumblebee, primus, and nvidia driver:\nIn the software installation application, enable the Universe and Multiverse repositories\nThen:\nsudo apt-get install bumblebee bumblebee-nvidia primus nvidia-331\n(for more details, I followed this link How to set up nVidia Optimus/Bumblebee in 14.04 )\n9 Do a reboot after installing them. This is important.\n10 Now you can Use primusrun to run your application. ( optirun does not work for me, but primusrun works perfectly in this laptop )\nFor example, type:  primusrun firefox  (it will show some warnings in the console, but it works)\nA last tip:  The loaders of many applications (the names that you use to call them in the command line or icon metadata ) are sometimes just a script that will call the application binary later inside the script. In these cases, primusrun will not work from the outside of the script. If you see that the loader is  is a text file (script)  you will have to edit that file and add primusrun to the line where the actual binary application is called. This was confusing me initially.\nThats all, good luck and hope it helps.\nJavier\n\nA: Have you installed the nvidia restricted drivers?

That mail contains the description of a successful job or the detailed report why the particular cron job failed.\nIf your local mail system is not set you will not receive those mails. The cron job output emails will just die in a local mail spool folder. So you need to set up your mailer daemon to read those mails. See this answer on How read local email in thunderbird to get all your local mails.\n\nIf your cronjob fails you will receive a mail stating the reason of failure. This is one of the best way to detect the error in setting a cron job. \nAlternate ways\nAccording to this answer one can get errors of a cronjob in a log file using redirection.

The trick to overcome this was to plug in a pendrive with more than 4.4GB and then it installed by default on the internal SDD with 1GB still to spare.\n\nA: So for whatever reason I found myself looking for a Linux distribution for the Asus Eee PC 4G (701) today, in 2019 :D\nRight now I am running BunsenLabs Linux Helium on it, from image bl-Helium-4-i386.iso. For installation troubleshooting, see my other answer. This distro is based on Debian 9, so pretty close to a recent Ubuntu. It runs nicely, with most of the Fn keyboard shortcuts etc. working out of the box, and still is very compact (~120 MiB main memory usage after start). Also, since it's Debian based, the .deb packaging system and package names etc. are all the same as in Ubuntu, and you can even add packages from Ubuntu repositories.\n \nAbout the CPU incompatibility issue\nMy first guess was that you might need a non-PAE kernel for this computer. PAE is \"physical address extension\", allowing a 32-bit processor to access main memory beyond 4 GiB. Normal Ubuntu / Lubuntu boot options in current releases fail to start the Linux kernel on non-PAE CPUs. The Eee PC 4G (701) uses a CPU \"Intel Celeron M Processor ULV 353\", which supports 32-bit Physical Address Extension (PAE), according to the specs. So it turns out that it is not necessary to utilize a non-PAE distribution. I installed a regular (PAE based) kernel, and it runs just fine.\nSo I am not sure what causes the \"CPU incompatibility\" issue in your case. Side note: Though I did not need it for this model of computer, some CPUs falsely advertise that they don't support PAE when in fact they do. In these cases, you can force the execution of a PAE kernel with with kernel options forcepae -- forcepae (detailed instructions).\n\nA: Is the architecture version you tried 64bit? For a EEE PC 701 4G, you need to install the 32bit version.\nYou don't say what version Ubuntu you tried. I have had 10.04 running for a few years now, and have previously booted 12.04 as a LiveUSB.\n\nA: For the EEE 701 I have tried a lot of different versions of Ubuntu. Now I am very content with the \"Peppermint ICE\" version.\nThe connections go very good and you still can add a lot of functional apps.\nSo try it! \nLet me now.\n\nA: If I remember correctly, that machine uses a Celeron M processor that does not support Physical Address Extensions (PAE), so the error you were likely getting was something like, \"This kernel requires the following features not present on the CPU: pae.\"\nYou will need a 32 bit distribution that supports non-pae processors, which is getting harder to find.  You might try reading this article for wisdom on getting Lubuntu or Xubuntu working on this machine.  However it did not run very well the last time I tried it. I ended up trying to use bodhi Linux, which i believe still has a non-pae supporting kernel available. I also gave puppy Linux a good run, but that one doesn't like to be installed, but rather run as a bootable live image.\nIf you are feeling particularly crafty, I've heard talked of folks getting arch Linux working on these. You will have to pull out your best Google foo for that one though. \nGood luck!\n\nA: Try the following link http://www.eeebuntu.org/release/eeebuntu or as another option would be maybe a netbook remix version of ubuntu on one of the archive versions. I did this a while ago and used an image unpacked onto an SD card to perform the install, after some settings changes in the BIOS (had to flash new BIOS version) to change the boot order it was pretty simple.\n\nA: Since it just have 512MB ram. I would advise against running the regular Ubuntu - Unity, Gnome or KDE version. It would be better to use lightweight version like Lubuntu, Xubuntu and Ubuntu. Your eeePC has a 32 bit processor, so try installing 32-bit version of these distributions. The best choice would be Lubuntu 14.04.4 LTS. Download Here\n", "Q: install xfce from a flash drive?

The main show-stopper is youtube video performance with is very choppy. \nAny thoughts whether additional RAM will fix this too, or would he proprietary fglrx drivers be a better bet? \n\nA: You should use Lubuntu but also install the latest open source Gallium drivers.\nHere's a link about installing the latest drivers and making sure you get the latest updates. \nHow do I install Gallium3d Drivers in Ubuntu 12.10?\nYou could also try installing the latest mainline kernel from ubuntu for 13.10 :\nhttp://kernel.ubuntu.com/~kernel-ppa/mainline/v3.12-saucy/\nHere's a link on how to install it. \nhttp://news.softpedia.com/news/How-to-Install-Linux-Kerrnel-3-12-in-Ubuntu-13-10-397013.shtml\nThese may leverage some extra performance out of your system, but the problem you have is lack of memory and processor power.\n\nA: First and foremost for an underpowered laptop like your HP you would be much better off running Lubuntu 13.10 instead of Unity and sticking to the open-source drivers that are built-into the default installation...\nSecondly, running gnome-mplayer will help with your videos as it seems to handle them better than gstreamer and failing that VLC is always available in the software-centre as a fallback...\nMore memory would help though for if the system runs low on memory it goes straight to using the swap file which can slow things down including video playback and youtube videos...\n\nA: Install Gnome Session Fallback\nsudo apt-get install gnome-session-fallback.\nLogout.

Need a way to recover or correct the problem BeagleBone is connected through Ethernet. Trying to enable wireless connectivity as well, after plugging a WiFi USB dongle. MiniHDMI port is remapped so cannot be used. The only way to access the BeagleBone is through ssh. For some reason that I cannot understand (greatly appreciated if you explain that to me), after changing the /etc/network/interfaces from:\nauto lo \niface lo inet loopback\nauto eth0 \niface eth0 inet dhcp\n\nto:\nauto lo \niface lo inet loopback\nauto eth0 \niface eth0 inet dhcp\nauto wlan0 \niface wlan0 inet dhcp #static\n\nI cannot ssh to my BeagleBone anymore. I can see from a computer connected to the same network (through arp -a) as well from my router configuration page, that the BeagleBone never gets an IP from any of the two interfaces. Any ideas on why this is happening and how can I fix it?\n\nA: OK, this is how I solved this. \nFirst of all, it seems that the interfaces configuration file does not accept inline comments and that caused the problem in the first place. I still cannot understand how this could actually affect both interfaces.\nSecond, and most important, in order to regain access to the BeagleBone, do the following:\n\n\n*\n\n*Create a bootable microSD with Ubuntu. This was the same that I used to install Ubuntu on the BeagleBone in the first place.\n\n*Plug an ethernet cable from BeagleBone to your router/computer.\n\n*Hold down the BootSD button (located at the far left corner, assuming that you hold the board with the ports towards your body) and power up the board, while holding down the button.\n\n*After 30\" you can release the button. Now you have booted from the operating system on the microSD.\n\n*All you have to do is:\nsudo mount /dev/mmcblk1p2 /mnt\n\nNow your filesystem form the MMC is loaded in the /mnt. For me it proved that mmcblk1p2 was where my filesystem was located on the BeagleBone. If that does not work as expected, try the rest of the entries /dev/mmc*, until you find the right one. \n\n*From /mnt you can edit, delete, restore, etc files that are in the BeagleBone. In my case, I corrected the /etc/network/interfaces.\n\n*Unmount and shutdown:\ncd \nsudo umount /mnt\nsudo shutdown now -h\n\n\n*Remove the microSD and start your BeagleBone normally and enjoy not having to reflash!\n", "Q: NEED OS X shortcuts / settings TLDR\nI'm used to working with os x on apple computers.

No luck. \n\n*I try to boot from Ubuntu HDD using special menu (F11). No luck.\n\n*It's impossible to boot Windows 8.1 by selecting it's HDD in the list. I have special menu item \"Windows boot manager\". If I click on it, it runs.\n\n\nLooks like Ubuntu should have a similar menu item, but it doesn't.\nWhat do I do wrong?\n\nA: Boot from your install media and take a look at your installation's /boot/grub.grub.cfg file.  The disks may be \"misnumbered/misnamed\" because when the file was generated, the USB stick was present and might have bumped up the disk numbers (and letters) by one.  If you have just the two SSDs, you expect one to be hd0 and the other to be hd1 in the grub.cfg file. \nIf you see hd2 references, that's the problem, there is no hd2. Just edit everything back one number in the case of hd? and if you see any /dev/sdb etc. Edit those back one letter to /dev/sda.\nAfter your first successful boot, immediately run \nsudo update-grub\n\nto fix the problem.\nIn a more complicated case, the UEFI Settings (BIOS) enumeration of the disks is different than what the running system sees.  There you will need to figure out which disk number is really the one you want.  Edit as above, but the update-grub will no longer be a permanent fix, you will need to edit after each kernel update.\nIt might be better to run boot-repair for information only, and post the output over in the forums.  these UEFI problems frequently take more back and forth interaction than this question and answer site is set up for.\nFor UEFI machines (with a black screen grub (grub-efi)  without any\nfunction key options, like the older grub-pc, edit the grub menu and add\nthe below options on the \"linux\" line, then boot with F10 or ctrl-X.\nOptions for Video problems:\nnomodeset\nacpi=0\nacpi_osi=linux\nacpi_backlight=vendor\nnoalpic\ni915.i915_enable_rc6=1\nvideo=1280x1024-24@60\nvideo=VGA-1:1280x1024-24@60\n\nTo allow Nvidia hybrid machines to boot:\nnouveau.blacklist=1\n\n", "Q: Do I need to disconnect an external hard drive before installing Ubuntu? I backed up my data to an external hard drive. Do I need to disconnect the drive before installing Ubuntu?\n\nA: It is not necessary, but I would suggest to unplug it for safety. This way, you are sure to not format it by mistake.\n\nA: *\n\n*No, it is not necessary to unplug the external drive, when you intend to install Ubuntu into the internal drive.\n\n*But it is a good idea, particularly when you have your backup on that drive. When all partitions are properly unmounted and the drive is unplugged, there is no risk that you overwrite your backup.\n\n*The opposite case: It makes things much easier, if you unplug the internal drive, when you intend to install Ubuntu into the external drive.\n\nA: no, just do not install ubuntu on the external drive\n\nA: You should not have to disconnect your external HDD when installing Ubuntu. The installer will give you the option of which drive you wish to partition and setup for the OS during the installation and as long as you don't select to install to the external HDD then it will remain untouched by the installer.\n\nA: I dont see any reasons to take it out or keep it...\nIf you are worried about it, and do not need it during the installation, might as well take it off! It should not interfere with the installation however... its just another disk....\n\nA: You can leave it plugged in.

The \"reading priority\" of the launcher is:\n\n\n*\n\n*the local directory for desktop files in in ~/.local/share/applications,\n\n*the global directory for desktop files in /usr/share/applications.\n\n\nThat means that if you start the application from the \"right\" (global) .desktop file, the launcher will check for a local version of the .desktop file on the next occasion and use the contents of that file.\nYou will have to remove the local .desktop file, log out and in, and lock the icon to the launcher again.\n\nA: In my case, the problem was that the local launcher definition (~/.local/share/applications/google-chrome-stable.desktop) was pointing to the wrong path for the chrome executable. Using whereis google-chrome-stable I replaced to the right path, then started google-chrome-stable & from terminal, locked to the launcher, voila.\n\nA: Your Chrome window may be off screen. Try checking your workspace settings. \nTo see that the process is still there.\nIn the terminal type:\nps ax | grep -i chrome\n\nIn the terminal type: \ndconf reset -f /org/compiz/ \nunity --reset-icons &disown\n\nIf the window still is not showing up, you may need to reboot the system so the changes apply.\n", "Q: Fastest way to reload graphics driver module? I am trying to get my way around on graphics driver development, in this case for modifications on a DRM kernel module, called gma500_gfx.\nEvery time when I have made a change to this driver, I start a script which compiles and replaces the previous kernel module (by a cp command), and restarts the Linux distro (Lubuntu).\nI am unable to reload this graphics driver module without restarting Linux (yet).\nThe commands modprobe and rmmod always give me a 'module in use' error.\nmodprobe gma500_gfx -r\nmodprobe: FATAL: Module gma500_gfx is in use.\n\nWhen I look at the dependencies I get the following list.\ngma500_gfx            185579  2 \ndrm_kms_helper         48716  1 gma500_gfx\ndrm                   298219  3 drm_kms_helper,gma500_gfx\nvideo                  19370  2 acer_wmi,gma500_gfx\ni2c_algo_bit           13413  1 gma500_gfx\n\nI am also unable to unload any of these dependencies, which give the same error.\nOther things that I have tried before the modprobe, but which are unsuccesful:\n\n\n*\n\n*Go to a single user environment by \"init 1\"\n\n*Shutdown lightdm by \"/etc/init.d/lightdm stop\" (which reduces the refcount by 1 to 1)\n\n\nDoes anybody know a faster way to reload the graphics driver module than restarting the Linux distribution?\n\nA: After a lot of research, I have found the two references that keep the module from unloading and how to reload the module. The two things holding a lock are:\n\n\n*\n\n*LightDM, a lightweight X display manager\n\n*The generic framebuffer framework\n\n\nTo remove the locks respectively:\n\n\n*\n\n*sudo /etc/init.d/lightdm stop\n\n*echo 0 > /sys/class/vtconsole/vtcon1/bind\nHowever, the second option unbinds the framebuffer framework from the gma500_gfx driver, which stops the screen output. So, it is better to combine nr. 2 with a script to unbind, unload the module, reset the screen and load the module again. AFAIK, I have to run this from a console.\n#!/bin/bash\necho 0 > /sys/class/vtconsole/vtcon1/bind\nmodprobe -r gma500_gfx\nmodprobe gma500_gfx\n/etc/init.d/lightdm start\n\nPreferably I would like to have 1 restart-script, which I can run directly from LightDM, which reloads the driver and restores the session. I have not been able to do this yet, however that is a different topic than the question above. Any suggestions for doing that, would make me happy. :)\n", "Q: can't delete a printer - how do I access the printing dialog with admin privileges? I am running Ubuntu 12.04.

Do I have to somehow access that screen with sudo and how ?\n\nA: Try the following command:\nsudo system-config-printer\n\n", "Q: Will there be future support for the pepper version of flashplugin for Firefox? I have both Firefox and Chromium installed, the latter with the pepperflashplugin enabled.\nSome sites no longer support the 11.2 version of Flash which is all I can get for Firefox. Is there at least talk of supporting pepper support for Firefox? I hate to think I won't be able to use Firefox any more.\n\nA: It is very unlikely that firefox will support the \"pepper API\" in the near future. There is a bugreport asking for the support here, it was opened on 2012-02-22 and was closed on the same they as WONTFIX. \nAlso there was a newer discussion between Mozilla developers here, with basically the same result: They are not going to support the \"pepper API\" in the near future (or at all).\nIt is also important to note that the pepper version of flash is made by Google, not Adobe. One quote from the previous link:\n\nEven if Firefox supported the Pepper API, we would still need a Pepper\n  version of Flash. And Adobe doesn't have one; Google does.\n\nThere are also some very interesting talks and facts about the \"pepper API\" in those two linked discussions, if you read them through you will get the idea why it is very unlikely that \"pepper flash\" will arrive to firefox.\nWhat you can do to get \"better\" flash support for Firefox is to install pipelight, which is a browser plugin which utilizes WINE to allow windows only plugins to run in a linux browser. So you can run the windows version of Silverlight, Flash, etc. from the linux version of Firefox. You can read more about it here. To install it do:\nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:pipelight/stable\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get install pipelight-multi\n\nThen to activate the pipelight flash plugin in firefox (and also deactivate the linux flash plugin):\nsudo update-alternatives --install \"/usr/lib/mozilla/plugins/flashplugin-alternative.so\" \"mozilla-flashplugin\" /usr/lib/pipelight/libpipelight-flash.so 1\nsudo update-alternatives --set mozilla-flashplugin /usr/lib/pipelight/libpipelight-flash.so\n\n(If you would like to restore the original linux flash plugin later you will have to run\nsudo update-alternatives --remove mozilla-flashplugin /usr/lib/pipelight/libpipelight-flash.so\n\n)\nThe pipelight installation instructions were taken directly from the developers' website, from here. \n\nA: Mozilla is developing its own flash support on Firefox,it's called Shumway.\n\nA: pepper-flash is specific to Chrome and to my knowledge it will never be available in any other browsers. We survived before flash came to linux, and we'll survive it's withdrawal.\n", "Q: squirrelmail unable to send / receive mail I am configuring my own mail server for my domain after installing dovecot, postfix and squirrelmail I am stuck again.\nThis time when i try to sendmail to an outside e-mail address I get this error :\nRequested action not taken: mailbox unavailable\n550 5.1.1 <xxxx@gmail.com>: Recipient address rejected: gmail.com\n\nIf I try to send mail to the user@mydomain I don't get a error but I don't receive anything.\nWhat can be the problem, please request more details if you need some.\n\nA: It could be a couple of things.\nFirst, see if port 25 is blocked by your ISP.

Unfortunately, the button did nothing.  After waiting quite a while and trying whatever I could to accept the license, I killed the process... probably not the smartest thing do have done?  \nSo now can anybody give me some help in either uninstalling what is there or doing a complete install?\nTIA,\nJohn\n\nA: This is within a terminal window.  Were you trying to click the button with the mouse?\nIt's slightly counter-intuitive, but often the only way to move to those kind of buttons in the terminal is to use the Tab key.  I discovered this many years ago when I first started using Linux, and had trouble finding an answer to what must have been obvious to everyone else.\nAnyways, open a terminal again.  sudo apt-get -f install will likely resume the installation you were just trying to do, if not, sudo apt-get install ubuntu-restricted-extras again.  I'm not 100% sure that simply being unable to select the button was your actual problem.\nSo yeah, Tab to the button, Enter to select.

Now it's black, I can't access the icons, and I can't apply a wallpaper. It's just dead. I followed the uninstall instructions and even installed Ubuntu Tweak and emptied all the junk stuff. No luck. Any fix for this? \nThis happened to me in 13.04 and I ended up needing to completely reinstall everything and I'm really hoping I don't have to do this again.\n\nA: I think you know the answer already.  Working with computers can be a pain but you sometimes you gotta do things over and over again before you get the result you desire.  Computers are no different.\n", "Q: Will it create any critical problems if one always uses ''sudo poweroff\"? Always I have to use sudo poweroff or sudo shutdown -h now to shut down my PC because the \"Shut down\" button is not working. According to this post sudo shutdown -h now is safe. But what about sudo poweroff? Moreover, would you recomend to use sudo poweroff or sudo shutdown -h now? I'm using 12.04.\n\nA: See here for an explanation of the differences between shutdown and poweroff.\nAs you can see, in your situation poweroff is essentially just invoking shutdown.  These are both safe (if you've saved important data and whatnot), SIGTERM (which tells processes to gracefully exit) is sent a few seconds before SIGKILL so that there shouldn't be any corruption.\nPressing the \"Shut Down\" button probably just calls one of these utilities.  You should probably figure out why that's not working.\n", "Q: \"Connection reset by peer\" when getting sshfs to mount?

I think I know the problem because I have the same laptop and, failing many times in trying to update the graphics driver, found that anything past CCC 13.4 (I think) for me turned the backlight off of the laptop display. Considering you can hear Ubuntu in the background, it sounds like everything is loading up fine... You just can't see it. Not very helpful.\nAnyway, I know this is an old thread but thought I would share my insights in case it helps anyone else :)\nOh and I got in touch with ASUS to see whether they could offer any help as to which driver is best suited, they simply directed me to their woefully out of date driver page for the laptop.\nCheers\n", "Q: How to secure postfix on Ubuntu Server I am setting up a new VPS server with LEMP.

Presently when I right click on it, there is no such option. Only eject or safely remove is present. I tried other devices and get the same result. Any insight into this problem will be appreciated.\nUbuntu 12.04 64\n\nA: I believe what you have is a scrambled flashdrive, basically there is no room on the flashdrive to reformat because the previous reformats are still present just not readable.  Might be time to fork up 5bucks mate.\n\nA: The steps you've listed sound like Windows not Ubuntu, are you talking about formating for the purpose of creating a bootable usb installer? Regardless, in ubuntu (or an ubuntu live cd) you can format the drive by opening gparted. 12.04 has gparted installed by default, if for some reason you don't you can always do so by typing \"sudo apt-get install gparted\". To format the device it must be unmounted, if it isn't already you can do so within gparted by clicking on it's parition(s) and selecting unmount. Then right click and choose \"format to\" and choose the desired file system. Then click apply.\nIf you are trying to format under windows and are having these difficulties, then try doing a format using the disk manager. You can access it from \"start menu/control panel/system and security/administrative tools/computer management/disk management\" it will list all storage devices, and give you the ability to eject, format, initialize. If you have trouble still, then there is a console application in windows called Diskpart it has the ability to create a new partition table, as well as format, and etc. You can find information about using diskpart here: http://support.microsoft.com/kb/300415 .

I am using Ubuntu 12.04 (does not happen on my work laptop, with a more recent distro version). What is this exactly?

Handling of which process goes where isn't done in userspace.\nThe only way I can think of to kind of do what you're after is to use ulimit to set the maximum amount of CPU time, which would prevent a user from hogging everything too much.  You can also change a user's nice level, so if a particular user is slamming the CPU you can lower their prority. \n", "Q: How can I boot Ubuntu from a USB drive on a Windows XP computer? My computer is a Microsoft Windows XP Media Center Edition 2005. I followed the directions to create a bootable USB using the Linux Pendrive Installer at Ubuntu.com. I have tried editing the boot hierarchy to boot from USB first, but the computer simply boots with Windows like normal. Do you have any suggestions? I simply want to use Ubuntu without having to permanently install it.\n\nA: Okay, push F10 > system configuration > boot options > boot order > USB Diskette on Key/USB Harddisk (put this at the top) \nF10 again and save/exit\nThat should to my knowledge boot the USB drive before anything else on the computer including the Windows OS\n\nA: 1) Did you md5sum check the downloaded iso?\n  See https://help.ubuntu.com/community/HowToMD5SUM\n  Check the number against the listing in the link for your release listed at\n  http://releases.ubuntu.com under the MD5SUMS link.\nIf that's your problem, redownload the iso and try again.  Once you have the good iso,\ncheck the media you create, and check your pc memory.\n2) Did you select the media check before trying to install?\n https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Installation/CDIntegrityCheck\n3) Did you ever do a \"memory check\" (another live-media menu choice) on your PC?\nDoing the above can save you a lot of time struggling with a bad install media.\nAll good, now you should be able to boot and \"Try\" successfully.\n", "Q: backing up from Ubuntu computer to NAS My setup is a Sony Vaio laptop running Ubuntu 13.10 and a BuffaloTech NAS hard-wired to a Netgear 6300 router.\nThe question is about automating the task of accessing the NAS from the laptop and backing up to it (using rsync).\nI wrote a script which mounts the NAS' root \"share\" folder (i.e. /share) to the local mountpoint ..../local_NAS_share, as follows:\nsudo mount -t cifs //192.168.1.26/share /media/dan/local_NAS_Share -o username=admin,password=adminpsswrd\n\nand this operation works fine.\nBTW, I have cifs-utils installed, but NOT Samba.\nSo the question is this:  if I want to access the NAS via a symbolic link, not via a static IP address (as seen above in //192.168.1.26), I believe that the BEST way to network the laptop with the NAS is via Samba.  Is that correct?\nIn other words, if I want to use a line such as\n//BuffaloNAS/share ... instead of //192.168.1.26/share.\nI would have to install Samba, which would map the NAS IP address to a symbolic link and resolve it.  Maybe that's not the only way of automating the backup task, but I am guessing that it's one of the better approaches.  Am I right?\nThe reason for asking the question in the first place is because the NAS IP is not really static; it changes when the NAS is powered down and restarted.  So every time that happens, I have to look up its IP address and change the script, and it would be preferable to automate this task so that the script would not have to be modified.  So I would like to know if Samba is my best bet.\n\nA: The easiest way to solve that is to just set a static IP for the NAS. Or you can configure the DHCP-Server so that the NAS always gets the same IP.\nAfter that you can edit the /etc/hosts file and add the NAS (name and IP) so you can use the name BuffaloNAS.\n", "Q: What is the difference between Vi and Vim? I would appreciate it if someone can let a newbie know what the differences are between vi and vim. I've heard Vim is a successor to vi but whenever I try to open vi in Ubuntu it opens vim instead.\n\nA: \"vi\" is a text editor from the early days of Unix. It became quite popular and made its way into the Single Unix Specification (SUS) and POSIX, but wasn't freely available until 2002. \nSo, several free vi-like editors emerged. Vim (\"vi improved\") is one of these editors. \nAs the name suggest it adds lots of functions to the original vi interface.\nIn Ubuntu Vim is the only vi-like editor installed by default, and vi actually starts Vim by default.\nOther popular vi-like editors available in Ubuntu are, for example, nvi and elvis.\n\nA: vi editor is the most popular text editor in Linux. We can say it has a simple black and white screen i.e. if you type any command there is no code highlighting, where as vim is improved version of VI it also has features same like vi but it also has code highlighting.\nBoth have these 4 basic modes: \n\n\n*\n\n*write mode  \n\n*command mode  \n\n*Visual mode  \n\n*escape mode  \n\n\nA: The Vim FAQ has a well formatted list:\nhttps://vimhelp.org/vim_faq.txt.html#faq-1.4\nExcerpt from the FAQ:\n\n\n*\n\n*Multi-level undo \n\n*Tabs, Multiple windows and buffers \n\n*Flexible insert mode (can use arrow keys in Insert Mode)\n\n*Macros \n\n*Visual mode (visually select sections of text)\n\n*Block operators \n\n*Online help system \n\n*Command-line editing and history \n\n*Command line completion (tab completion)\n\n*Horizontal scrolling (long lines) \n\n*Unicode and internationalization improvements. \n\n\nA: Functionally, vim is almost a proper superset of vi. Therefore, everything that is in vi is available in vim.\nVim adds onto those features. Here are a some of the extended vim features:\n\n\n*\n\n*Vim has been ported to a much wider range of OS's than vi.\n\n*Vim includes support (syntax highlighting, code folding, etc) for several popular programming languages (C/C++, Python, Perl, shell, etc).\n\n*Vim integrates with cscope.\n\n*Vim can be used to edit files using network protocols like SSH and HTTP.\n\n*Vim includes multilevel undo/redo.\n\n*Vim allows the screen to be split for editing multiple files.\n\n*Vim can edit files inside a compressed archive (gzip, zip, tar, etc).\n\n*Vim includes a built in diff for comparing files (vimdiff).\n\n*Vim includes support for plugins, and finer control over config and startup files.\n\n*Vim can be scripted with vimscript, or with an external scripting language (e.g. python, perl, shell).\n\n\nThere are many more differences. Refer below sources which are few of good places to start finding out more.\nSource: Vim.Org, Vim on Wikpedia.\nHope it helps! :)\n\nA: There is indeed quite a big difference between them. I use both nvi and vim daily. Neither of them are perfect, but they're still better than anything else is out there.\nVim has more of everything. In addition to syntax hilighting (when compiled with a support for it) it does automatic conversions of charactersets, line-endings and such. It has multiple ways of numbering lines, which is really convenient. Vim certainly has a lot that speaks for it.\nUnfortunately vim breaks the vi philosophy by mixing the editor modes and introducing a vast number of useless and redundant functions. Sure it's convenient at first that you can for example move with cursor keys in insert mode, but it also has some really weird unwanted side-effects (for example the . gets quirky and unpredictable).\nVim (while certainly being IMproved as it claims) is also a bloated, weird and inconsistent mixture of a broken vi and a modeless editor. :P\nI still love it, though. And you can fix most of that by tuning you configuration ;D\n\nA: To add to what @gen said, it is easier to read it straight from vimhelp.org, if you don't wish to test things yourself.\nThe reality is most people use very little of \"real\" vi's capabilities and even less of vim's or nvi's.\nhttps://vimhelp.org/vi_diff.txt.html\nhttps://vimhelp.org/options.txt.html#%27compatible%27\nhttps://vimhelp.org/vi_diff.txt.html#posix-compliance\nThe biggest thing I notice is how undo / re-do has been brok.. er.. \"improved\" in vim, the non-classic behavior of the \"BACKSPACE\" key, and how slow vim-tiny is compared to n/vi at times.\nOne append of 50,000 repetitions can lock a session up for almost an hour in any vim version I've ever tested.\nA 2,000,000 append of the same data in nvi takes less than 5 seconds.\nThe vim Devs know about this bug but do not think it is worth fixing.\n^[50000aUse vim or nvi or vi?^[\nBetter not try that in vim on a Production box.  Just sayin'\nIf you don't know, ^[ is the code for the \"ESCAPE\" key.  You SHOULD know that.\nGenerally your basic vim skills of ^[ibla foo bar^[:wq! will transfer enough to \"real\" vi if you need to support a real UNIX such as AIX, HP-UX, or Solaris.\nBut if you rely on arrow keys to \"move around\" while in Insert mode then you are going to be in for a rough time.\nYou should not be moving the cursor around in Insert mode, arrrow keys or otherwise, 1980's or not.  Movement is meant to be done in Command mode.  It is faster and allows you to use the actual power of vim|n/vi.\nOtherwise you might as well be using MS Win Notepad.\nIf you use vim|n/vi as intended then the hjkl and/or arrow keys --in Command mode-- will still be your last resort for getting around in a file.  It is too inefficient and slow.\nYou type \"new\" text in Insert mode, while almost all movement and text editing is done in Command mode.\nThis is the part many people don't seem to get.\nArrow keys don't work in Insert mode and type \"garbage\" when they are pressed because they are literally telling vi to \"insert\" the control code for your arrow key, so it does: ^B.  Then people complain that UNIX/vi is doing what they told it to do!  If you don't want vi to Insert the character then stop telling it to. Simple: Movement is done in Command mode.\nAlso, vim|n/vi have 2 modes in common:  Insert mode and Command mode.\nThere is no such thing as \"Escape\" mode.  ^[ just puts you in Command mode.\nn/vi does not have a \"Visual Block\" mode, which is specific to vim.\nBut since marks have served that purpose in vi since the late 1970's then I question why a Visual Block mode is necessary.  Maybe for people who actually use the COLUMN selection feature?\nNot knowing what vi marks and named buffers are, or how to use them demonstrates that people have not went through some of the most basic vi tutorials that have been around since the 80's or even read the man pages.\nFinally, to all the people who think \"vi\" is on Ubuntu, or almost any GNU/Linux system, for that matter -\n:version\nThe name is almost certainly a symlink to some vim binary somewhere.\nAll of this information has been publicly available about vi for around 40 years now.\n-EDIT-\nI just thought of 2 other ways that vim is not POSIX vi:\n\n*\n\n*CTRL+R is expected to redraw the screen, not vim's \"redo\"\n\n*Q (which is outright DISABLED in some vim builds, apparently) is supposed to switch you back to ex.\n\n\nA: Vim is also a Linux text editor. It is an upgraded version of vi, and its full name is vi improved. In addition to the functions of vi, it has the features of multi-level undo, visual operation, syntax highlighting, and ease of use.\nBoth vi and vim are editors in Linux. The difference is that vim is advanced and can be regarded as an upgrade version of vi. vi is used for text editing, but vim is more suitable for coding.\nLinux ESC: The difference between vi and vim\n", "Q: How can I install Ubuntu on an external hardrive from Windows? I want to install Ubuntu 12.04 on an external hard drive from Windows 7 itself so that I can do other things while it is installing. The tutorials I saw on Google tell me to first get it on a DVD and then install it on to the external HDD. Is it possible to do a direct install instead? \nHow can I install Ubuntu on an external hardrive from Windows?\n\nA: You can't install it from windows. You have to boot it from a CD or USB drive (see http://www.ubuntu.com/download/desktop/create-a-usb-stick-on-ubuntu) and then install it from there. As far as HOW to install it, boot it up from your install disk, then install it as normal until you get to the partition part, then click \"something else\", and change the device from your main hard drive to your external one. Make sure you've backed up your external hard drive if you have anything on it before you do any of this. Move/ format/ re size the necessary partitions and then just install. Just be careful you select the right disk and such when you do so because you risk losing your data on whatever drive you install it on. \n", "Q: Tear-free disabled in Intel Graphics, tearing in Xubuntu I use Xubuntu 13.10 and have installed the Intel Graphics Installer.

Restoring the package fixed things, tear free worked again.

I copied the files from Windows and I can see the files but not the installer.\n\nA: The Windows version of Steam will not natively run on Linux. If you've copied your Steam folder to a USB stick in Windows, this will be the Windows version of Steam. This leads us to several possibilities depending on what it is you're actually trying to do:\nInstalling Steam on Linux without Internet connection\nYou will need to download the following file to a memory stick or burn it to some form of optical media:\nhttp://media.steampowered.com/client/installer/steam.deb\n\nThis link is available by browsing to the Steam Store About Page on a PC running Linux (if you browse to it on a Windows machine you'll get a .exe file instead, which isn't natively compatible with Linux). \nOnce you've got this file copied to your Ubuntu machine, you can install it by running the following command:\ndpkg -i steam.deb\n\nNote: you will still need an Internet connection on this machine to actually run Steam.\nInstalling Steam on Linux with Internet connection\nTo install Steam on Ubuntu, you can simply run the following command:\nsudo apt-get install steam\n\nThis will install Steam (which will then update itself on first run, and keep itself updated in future).\nRunning it with Wine\nThe third option for running Steam on Linux is to run the Windows version of Steam on Linux via Wine.  \nTo do this, you will need to install Wine on your machine.\nOnce Wine is installed, you can run many .exe files simply by double clicking on them, like you would do in Windows.  \nIf you've already copied your Steam folder from within Windows, once you've got Wine installed you can run Steam simply by running Steam.exe from within the folder you copied.\n\nA: Hold up.  You're trying to install Steam for Windows on Ubuntu?\nIf you just copied your Steam folder from Windows straight onto a thumb drive, you can run steam.exe in Wine and it should work.

So when you are in a terminal session your PATH is different from the one which is used when the .desktop file is invoked. \nTo troubleshoot this case:\n\n\n*\n\n*To see where java is installed: which java\n\n*Check your ~/.profile if the correct PATH with the java directory is set in it. If the correct path is only set in .bashrc, .zshrc, etc. then it is possible that those scripts are not invoked on login, so the PATH is not set correctly.  Also if you have ~/.bash_profile or ~/.bash_login you have to check those too. If you provide these files we can look into this whether this is your problem.\nIf you can't solve it this way, you can always modify the PATH directly in the .desktop file with env PATH= ...\n\nA: I've copied the following block from within the if [ -n \"$BASH_VERSION\" ]; then statement:\nif [ -f \"$HOME/.bashrc_\" ]; then\n    . \"$HOME/.bashrc\"\nfi\n\nI've also tried without the if statement:\n. \"$HOME/.bashrc\"\n\nbut Eclipse fails with the same error message in both cases.  Apparently HOME isn't set when lightdm runs ~/.profile.\nExplicitly setting the path in ~/.profile works, but I want to keep my PATH and my other Bash features (aliases, functions) in the same file.\nThe solution is to set the PATH on the Exec=env PATH=$PATH:... line in eclipse.desktop.  Nothing I've tried works to start IntelliJ from a desktop icon, however.\nGiven that you are reinventing the Linux GUI experience with Unity maybe it's time to leave the error prone series of scripts behind and use something that is less error prone and easier to use.  The scripts would still have to be there for bash shells, but the Unity desktop could be independent of them.\n\nA: I have a very simple method.\nOpen Gedit or Text Editor.

Before adding this rule both the server and client could ping each other.\nPlease tell me what am I missing here...\nAnswers given are correct but how does it works....???\nAdding --icmp-type echo-request does resolve the issue but this rule is being added to the INPUT chain rules, so how can this rule anyway mess with the OUTPUT chain, as it's blocking the ping to client.\n\nA: As I understand ping command sends ICMP echo request to the host, then host reply ICMP echo reply. So if you block all ICMP, ping doesn't work at all.\nYou should add this:\niptables -A INPUT -i eth0 -p icmp --icmp-type echo-request -s 192.168.56.101 -j DROP\n\nThis will block only request, but not reply\nAnswering you question in comments\nIt does not blocking outgoing ping request. It is blocking all incoming ICMP packets.\nWhen you execute ping:\n\n*\n\n*ping send ICMP request packet to 192.168.56.101 (It is outcoming ICMP)\n\n\n*192.168.56.101 receive this packet and send reply ICMP packet back to your server\n\n\n*Now your server iptables block this incoming reply packet. That's what is happening.\nYou can check it using this command sudo tcpdump ip proto \\\\icmp on 192.168.56.101. It will show you all ICMP requests/replies online.\nDo this:\n\n*\n\n*Remove this rule from server:\niptables -A INPUT -i eth0 -p icmp --icmp-type echo-request -s 192.168.56.101 -j DROP\n\n\n*Add this rule to your server:\niptables -A INPUT -i eth0 -p ICMP -s 192.168.56.101 -j DROP\n\n\n*Now execute this command on 192.168.56.101:\nsudo tcpdump ip proto \\\\icmp\n\n\n*Execute ping 192.168.56.101 on server.\nNow you should see on 192.168.56.101 that it receive ping request, and send reply. But iptables on server block this reply.\n\nA: Obviously you are not going to get any reply back. A ping request has two parts:\n\n\n*\n\n*Client -> Server: ICMP echo-request (a.k.a. \"ping\")\n\n*Server -> Client: ICMP echo-reply (a.k.a. \"pong\")\n\n\nBlocking all types of ICMP will bring trouble. If you would like to prevent the client from \"pinging\" (sending a PING request), then use the following rule on the server:\n-A INPUT -i eth0 -s 192.168.56.101/32 -p ICMP --icmp-type echo-request -j DROP\n\nTo prevent the client from sending a ICMP ping request in the first place, you could apply this rule on the client:\n-A OUTPUT -o eth0 -d 192.168.56.100/32 -p ICMP --icmp-type echo-request -j DROP\n\nIt is highly unusual to avoid block a client from pinging a single IP address, from the client side though. The only reason you would do this is because your assignment requires that no ICMP ping packet flows through the network from the client, directed to the server.\nI wonder why you want to block ping requests on a LAN though. With ARP, the client can still know that this server is connected to the network.\n", "Q: Changing my default bittorrent?

I am very lost. \n\nA: To make a program your default; right click any .torrent file on your computer, \"properties\", go to \"open with\" tab. Choose the program you like and set it as default.\nThis would set the default program to open .torrent files, but it would not change the program that opens magnet links (sadly).\nSetting the program that opens magnet links is a little bit harder. Try to follow this or try following me:\nFirstly we need to check that your program's \".desktop file\" (in /usr/share/applications) has this line:\nMimeType=application/x-bittorrent;application/x-torrent;\n\nTo check, open the text editor (called gedit) and hit \"open\" up to the left, then navigate to your program's .desktop file. As stated; you should find it in the folder /usr/share/applications. After you open it, search for \"MimeType\" (by pressing Ctrl+f and typing \"MimeType\" in the box that shows up).\n...If you did find that it has this line then proceed. (if not then just put the line in. Modify the existing line.) Close gedit.\n\nNow that we've done the checking; open the file /usr/share/applications/defaults.list (the same way you opened the .desktop file). Search for \"x-scheme-handler/magnet\" (same way also). If you found it, make it look like this;\nx-scheme-handler/magnet=YOURPROGRAM.desktop;\n\nReplace YOURPROGRAM by the program you want to set default.

The download works well, every time I run the script a new picture is being downloaded. However it only changes the wallpaper on the first time after a fresh start/ fresh log in. Starting with the second execution there's an ''animation'' on the desktop (turning blueish) but the wallpaper stays the same even though there's a different picture saved in my wallpaper directory. When i log out and back in again, the new picture appears as the wallpaper.\nDoes anyone know what may cause it? I've found this and implemented it, but it changed nothing. Also I think it is not related to crontab, because it also fails by manual execution.\nThe command used to set the wallpaper is the following \ngsettings set org.gnome.desktop.background picture-uri file:///path/to/file.jpg\n\nEDIT: The command above is the only relevant part, since executing it directly via terminal produces the same behavior.\n\nA: Trying a little bit and reading about the bug I figured out a really simple workaround. \nYou will have to sandwitch your \"picture-url\" command disabling and enabling againg the draw-background entry. Basically, your line should look like this:\ngsettings set org.gnome.desktop.background draw-background false && gsettings set org.gnome.desktop.background picture-uri file:///home/$USER/Imágenes/pic.jpg && gsettings set org.gnome.desktop.background draw-background true\n\nI've just made a one-liner that do gsettings set org.gnome.desktop.background draw-background false change the wall and then activate the entry again. :)\nIt works like a charm! Thanks for the question! ^_^\n\nA: I had this problem too, in my case it turned out that X file handles were leaking and eventually ran out (I changed my wallpaper every 15 mins).\nSolution was:\ngsettings set org.gnome.desktop.background picture-uri \"\"\nwget https://path/to/image.jpg -O ~/wp.jpg\ngsettings set org.gnome.desktop.background picture-uri \"file:///home/me/wp.jpg\"\n\nUnsetting and then setting the wallpaper solved the issue.\n\nA: Seems like a known bug:\nhttps://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/nautilus/+bug/1033034\nHope this helps!\nMore information: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/10374520/gsettings-with-cron/19666729#19666729\n", "Q: SSH->SCP connection without password prompt on every attempt I would like to have a loop script run over two machines (with global IP), in which during the loop I have several scp command for  exchanging the outputs of those executions.

I'm using Thunar 1.6.3 and currently when I'm looking at a bunch of folders it looks something like this:\nFolder 1        8,2 kB\nFolder 2        4,1 kB\nFolder 3        4,1 kB\nFolder 4        0   kB\n\nI'm not sure where these \"size\" numbers come from, but I'm sure they do not reflect the actual size of everything in the folders, because when I right click and choose \"Properties\" the folders (all of them only kilobytes in size) add up to over 100 Gb.\nQuestions\n\n\n*\n\n*Why does Thunar, just like the command line on both 12.04 and 14.04, show folder sizes like 4K? What does this number mean?\n\n*Is there a way to instead show compound size, that is the calculated recursive size of the folder and all contents, in the terminal, Thunar or any other file manager? (NB: I'm not looking for a shell script solution).\n\n\nA: I should explain a bit of Linux File System structure to explain this. Most linux file systems do something similar, but I assume ext4, which is the current default.\nFile System Structure\n\n*\n\n*inode is the basic block that the file system understands as a logical unit.\n\n*A directory inode contains references to other inodes.\n\n*A file inode contains the metadata, actual data, and references to continuation blocks, in case the file had to be stored in a non contiguous manner.\n\nLinks\n\n*\n\n*Ext4 supports two kinds of links. Hard and Soft.\n\n*A hard link is a reference to inode directly. Each file has atleast one hard-link, from the directory it belongs to.\n\n*Since a directory is just a inode, with information about group of inode references, it can reference itself, or a parent. In other words, a folder can be both child and parent to the same folder.\n\nOkay, this may be getting confusing. Let me explain. Assume you have three folders, A,B,C as follows.\nC is in B.  \nB is in A.\n\nNow, the fun part is, C can point to the same inode as A, creating what is sometimes called a circular reference loop. If you try recursing, you will encounter a never ending loop.\n\n*\n\n*Soft links are ordinary files that record the directory path to their target location. They are just marked on the filesystem that instead of a line of text, they should be interpreted as a link to some other location. Nautilus, for example, creates soft links when you use its 'Create link'/'Link here' options.\n\nSo What?\nHence, trying to calculate sizes recursively has its quirks. It is a bad idea to try and compute sizes recursively by default. However, properties dialogs of all decent file managers I know show recursively calculated total sizes, because that is what an ordinary user expects.\nWindows has no problem?\nActually, windows uses a different file system format called NTFS, which maintains a list of all files and their size. So it can always tell the total size easily.\nThen why don't we use NTFS?\nIt does not support the Unix notion of permissions (rwx for owner, group, and universe separately), and that single reason makes it unfit for use as a Linux file system. Ext4 brings a lot to the table that this minor inconvenience doesn't matter to many.\nAlright. Gimme the size I need.\nDid you try du?\nHow does du work?\ndu stands for disk usage. It actually counts the inode blocks, taking care to not double-count them. Add up the sizes, and you have the total size.\nTL;DR\nUse du -hs <foldername> to find the actual size of the folder on disk. Read man du for more info.\n\nA: At thunar top menu go to Edit>Configure Custom Actions, add a new Custom Action with:\n\n\n*\n\n*Basic tab: any Name [ex. Folder(s)-Files Size], Command du -h -c %N | grep total | zenity --text-info or du -chs %N | zenity --text-info for the selected folder or/and file size followed by the total size.\n\n*Appearance Conditions tab: check all the boxes.\n\n\nI found this solution at http://crunchbang.org\n\nA: A bit of trivia to this topic specific to Thunar is that Thunar reports different sizes than both du with or without the --apparent size option.  I thik the provided anwser foor du ive a hint as to why that might be (perhaps Thunar actually counts these same things slightly differently whatever that may be).\nExample: Same folder: (x being the remainder I didn't write down)\ndu without --apparent-size: 19.x GB\ndu with --apparent-size:12.x GB\nThunar 5.5x GB\nThunar value in parenthesis: 5.9x GB\nI would probably in the end take du's output (being as old as it is), but this is interesting nonetheless.\n", "Q: Ubuntu Server 10.04 will not connect to the internet I created an dd image from a VirtualBox with Ubuntu server 10.04 on it.

The pc with the ssd is connected to internet and I can do anything on it using a bootable cd.\nifconfig shows only local loopback\nifconfig -a shows also eth1 but no eth0\nany solutions?\n\nA: It's because the virtual machine was configured to use the virtual network cable, since you've moved it to physical hardware the connection isn't available. You will need to edit your connection to use the new network connection as it's default. \nStep #1 = In terminal type \"sudo nano /etc/network/interfaces\". It should say \"# The primary network interface\",\"auto eth0\",\"iface eth0 inet dhcp\". Change all\nthe \"eth0\" entries to say \"eth1\". Exit using \"cntrl + x\" and press \"enter\" to save (ignore the options listed when saving, just press enter).\nStep #2 = In terminal type \"sudo ifup eth0\". \nStep #3 = In terminal type \"ping example.djun.net\". If succesful your screen will fill with somthing along the lines of \"64 bytes from ip-\" related outputs.\npress \"cntrl + c\" to stop pinging. You are done!

The Motherboard splash-screen shows up on both displays, then the primary goes blank and the grub-loader pops up on the HDTV. Once I have selected what to boot, my primary blinks back on and everything is fine. My problem is I don't want to have to turn on my HDTV every time I boot up my computer.\nThanks in advance!\n\nA: I had the same problem. In my case grub would appear on both displays with the same resolution (1920X1080) which is not handled by my primary display. So first you want to check if this is the case with you. \nRun terminal enter:\nsudo gedit /etc/default/grub\n\nUncomment the line \n#GRUB_TERMINAL=console\n\nSave and close. Run \nsudo update-grub\n\nAnd reboot, you should see console output of grub on both terminals. Hit 'c' to enter commandline. Run\nvbeinfo\n\nThe resolutions which are handled by your video output should be there. In my case 1680X1050X32 was there, but the preferred one by grub was 1920X1080.\nSo boot up linux and set the resolution which is acceptable for both displays:\nRun terminal enter:\nsudo gedit /etc/default/grub\n\nLook for the line \nGRUB_GFXMODE=1680x1050x32\n\nI set it to 1680X1050X32. In your case it might be different. Save and run\nsudo update-grub\n\nIn case your grub can not handle the resolution it will respond not found during update-grub command.\nAfter finishing the update, reboot, and you should see a working grub on both displays.\n\nA: My solution to this would be to get GRUB to automatically boot the kernel you last selected -  then you would not need to select anything, and can just leave it to it. To do that, open an editor with the grub configuration file by running this:\nsudo nano /etc/default/grub\nand set this line to saved, and remove any # from the beginning of the line as well:\nGRUB_DEFAULT=saved\n\n\nalso, set this line to true:\nGRUB_SAVEDEFAULT=true\n\nAlso set this so it dissapears after 2 seconds:\nGRUB_TIMEOUT=2\n\nIf these lines are not in the file, add them in.\n\nAlso, to get rid of GRUB completely, set this to 0:\nGRUB_TIMEOUT=0\n\nbut as it is sometimes useful for GRUB to be shown, to recover the system, or boot to a different kernel, you may want to set this to 1 or 2 seconds, like the above GRUB_TIMEOUT=2.\nyou could also hide the menu unless a key is pressed during the 2 seconds time period:\nGRUB_TIMEOUT=0\nGRUB_HIDDEN_TIMEOUT=2\n\n\nAfter making any of the above modifactions, save you changes with Ctrl+O, and exit with Ctrl+X, then run this to update the changes:\nsudo update-grub\n\nNow, it should automatically select as default the entry you selected previously, and disappear after a timed delay, and hide if you wish it.

I have Ubuntu server 13.10 , with the xubuntu-desktop package installed for convenience (but not meant to run all the time). Currently it does nothing (with or without gui), although the xfce4-power-manager marks that it would lock the screen.(Does the gui needs to be on for the settings in the power manager to have effect?). There is also no option in the power manager to only turn the screen off. The switch in the laptop screen does work because it is able to get the system out of standby when I manually suspend it. \n(Some additional info:\nI'm aware of logind.conf of systemd: everything is commented there, and if I understood correctly the HandleLidSwitch= option does not offer a way to get the screen only blank. The graphics card is an integrated Intel one: 82852/855GM.)\n\nA: You need to set the appropriate setting in your power manager. If you're using Xfce, then in xfce4-power-manager you can access Preferences, then you can set in the Monitor tab the timeouts for Put display to sleep or Switch off display. Thus the power manager will turn the screen off after a given timeout period.

I'm thinking of trying Ubuntu but if I don't like it, how hard is it to switch back? All the tech lingo is very confusing. Can I switch back and forth from Windows to Ubuntu? Thanks.\n\nA: If you want to try Ubuntu,then the best option is make a bootable Ubuntu live disk,boot from it.And then click on try Ubuntu option on startup to experience the features of Ubuntu.\nOr \nYou can install Ubuntu on a virtual machine softwares like virtualbox,VMware and make a try on it.\n", "Q: Why does tar complaint that it cannot find the file while extracting the archive? I uninstalled xampp and tried to reinstall it but when trying to extract it to the /opt directory, I get the following error:\n$ sudo tar -xzf xampp-linux-1.8.3-2-installer.run.tar.gz -C /opt\ntar (child): xampp-linux-1.8.3-2-installer.run.tar.gz: Cannot open: No such file or directory\ntar (child): Error is not recoverable: exiting now\ntar: Child returned status 2\ntar: Error is not recoverable: exiting now.\n\nWhy does tar complaint that it cannot find the file while extracting the archive?\n\nA: Most likely the dir in the terminal (identified by pwd) does not contain the archive that you're trying to unpack. You need to cd /path_to_archive_dir/, and then execute the command there (tar -xzf xampp-linux-1.8.3-2-installer.run.tar.gz -C /opt). \n", "Q: error message \" Mailing to remote domains not supported\" in mutt how to fix How can I set up any command line mail agent to deliver to gmail accounts?\n\nA: It would seem that the text of this error might originate from exim4 in Debian:\n# fgrep remote /var/log/exim4/mainlog.1 | sed -E 's#([ <])[^ <]+@[^ >]+([ >])#\\1a@b\\2#g' | head -1\n2019-01-08 00:47:00 1ggebk-00055M-St ** a@b <a@b> R=nonlocal: Mailing to remote domains not supported\n#\n\nIt would appear that the solution would be to reconfigure exim4, and within the initial ncurses dialogue, make sure to select the internet site; mail is sent and received directly using SMTP option (in place of what is probably, the local delivery only; not on a network option):\ndpkg-reconfigure exim4-config\n\nNote that although the top option implies that mail from the internet would now be accepted, it would appear that even if selected, by default it's still limited to the localhost IPv4/IPv6 addresses for accepting the mail (if you leave the defaults in subsequent prompts of the reconfig), so, it would seem that you don't really have to worry about having the smtp port open on the server to the outside world just by selecting the top-level option (TBH, it then makes little sense why it's not even the default, as sending mail to the outside world is a pretty common operation that generally works without any extra configuration on all BSD systems, for example, unless you're using something like Google Cloud, I guess, where the outgoing SMTP ports are blocked).\n\nA: Here's a link there describe howto configure mutt for gmail.\n", "Q: visit: command not found I just installed \"visit\", a scientific visualization software, on Ubuntu 12.04 using the commands given in the visit install notes for Unix given here.

I'm not exactly a Linux guru, so what is the general fix for something like this?  If you'll notice in the commands above, the search path is set (I'm not really sure what this is); could this be the source of the problem?  I am only able to open the software by cd'ing to the visit/bin directory and running ./visit, which I don't think should be necessary.\n\nA: The problem is likely with last line you followed in your instructions:\necho \"set path = ($path /Documents/visit/bin)\" >> .cshrc\n\nThis only applies if you're using C Shell. As a Ubuntu user the chances are that your default shell is bash.\nSince you're getting a \"command not found\" error when trying to run your application, you can assume that your current $PATH variable doesn't include the folder /Documents/visit/bin. You can check this by running the following command:\necho $PATH\n\nThis will likely return something along the lines of:\n/usr/local/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/sbin:/usr/bin:/sbin:/bin:/usr/games:/usr/local/games\n\nTo do the equivalent with bash you'll want to follow the instructions in this question over on Stack Overflow: How to permanently set $PATH on Linux?\nAlternatively... follow these steps:\n\n\n*\n\n*Edit .bashrc or .profile (in your home directory) with your favourite editor\n\n*Find a line that states export PATH=, if you find one, skip to step 4\n\n*Add a line at the bottom of the file that states export PATH=$PATH\n\n*Add :<path/to>/visit/bin to the end of the line you found in step 2, or added in step 3, where <path/to> is the folder you installed visit into\n\n\nYou only need to add this line in either .bashrc or .profile, there's no need to add it to both.\n", "Q: Mysql died and won't start I am working on Ubuntu 12.10 server with nginx, mysql and unicorn installed.

In fact, you do not even need a desktop at all to run steam.\nAn example of that is that a Steam session can be added to LightDM or any other login managers to run Steam in big picture mode instead of the actual desktop.\nAnd by the way: SteamOS is built on top of the stable release branch of Debian, not Ubuntu, Ubuntu is as well officially supported as any other Linux distribution. Not that it matters, most of the popular Linux distribution will run Steam without any issues.\n", "Q: Connect to internet via captive portal from console I use Plasma-Desktop.

Can I do this without extra packages?\n\nA: wicd-curses is a ncurses network manager.\nAlternatively you can do it manually.\n", "Q: Canon MX320 printer doesn't print any more I have Canon Pixma MX320 printer, that used to print ok in Ubuntu 12.04...after I uninstalled KDE Plasma (I made back up before that) it stopped working...I suppose I uninstalled canon drivers...is it possible to restore just appropriate canon drivers or should I install them again (I forgot the procedure)?\n\nA: In Ubuntu you not needed to care on drivers for printers. Just got to setting > printers and add a new. Ubuntu finds your printer.\nIt must be plugged in via USB.\n\nA: Try running sudo apt-get install cups* printer-driver-cjet printer-driver*. \nThis should install most of the available drivers... \nDisclaimer-type thing:\nIf you computer has Nvidia graphics , you might not want to run this, as I noticed it seemed to be installing alot of nvidia* packages...

This violates\n    #     the SSL/TLS standard but is needed for some brain-dead browsers. Use\n    #     this when you receive I/O errors because of the standard approach where\n    #     mod_ssl sends the close notify alert.\n    #   o ssl-accurate-shutdown:\n    #     This forces an accurate shutdown when the connection is closed, i.e. a\n    #     SSL close notify alert is send and mod_ssl waits for the close notify\n    #     alert of the client. This is 100% SSL/TLS standard compliant, but in\n    #     practice often causes hanging connections with brain-dead browsers. Use\n    #     this only for browsers where you know that their SSL implementation\n    #     works correctly.\n    #   Notice: Most problems of broken clients are also related to the HTTP\n    #   keep-alive facility, so you usually additionally want to disable\n    #   keep-alive for those clients, too. Use variable \"nokeepalive\" for this.\n    #   Similarly, one has to force some clients to use HTTP/1.0 to workaround\n    #   their broken HTTP/1.1 implementation. Use variables \"downgrade-1.0\" and\n    #   \"force-response-1.0\" for this.\n    BrowserMatch \"MSIE [2-6]\" \\\n            nokeepalive ssl-unclean-shutdown \\\n            downgrade-1.0 force-response-1.0\n    # MSIE 7 and newer should be able to use keepalive\n    BrowserMatch \"MSIE [17-9]\" ssl-unclean-shutdown\n\n\n\n\nA: The solution for me was to follow the following post using the ifmodule code contained there and not, as you and I would have expected, the example code in the file default-ssl.

How can I install these drivers on my laptop with the Ubuntu ?\n\nA: Windows drivers will not work on Ubuntu. Ubuntu uses the drivers provided in the Linux kernel. Everything should just work out of the box. With each new release of the Linux kernel more hardware is supported. It's generally a good idea to wait for a new release of Ubuntu to install on a new computer so that there is better support for the hardware.\nThere are a few special cases where a additional Linux driver may be needed:\n\n\n*\n\n*Discrete graphics (Nvidia, and ATI graphics)\n\n*Wifi\n\n*other hardware\n\n\nDiscrete graphics drivers are provided by Ubuntu through the additional drivers software (12.04).

I am new to Ubuntu and I can't seem to figure out how to connect to the wireless through my Bell Router.\nI am using Ubuntu 12.04 in VirtualBox on a Macbook Pro Retina, and do not have the adapter to connect over Ethernet.\nThanks.\n\nA: The host should be connected to your wifi router network, the vm uses a virtual lan to connect to your host and share it's internet connection. In Ubuntu you will see a lan connection, that is what you want. \nNetwork Connection Journey:\nRouter <----As-Wifi----> Host <----As-Virtual-Lan----> Virtual Machine \nScreenshot Of Default VirtualBox Network Settings For An Ubuntu VM:\n\nScreenshot Of Default Network Settings Within The Ubuntu VM:\n\n\nA: VirtualBox does not natively offer Wireless support (Like a virtualized Wireless device). Instead, it connects directly to the Wireless device the Host uses. Note that VirtualBox does NOT provide a virtualized Wireless device inside the guest (ubuntu in your case). They will all look like a wired one, even if the host (osx in your case) is providing the connection via a Wired or Wireless card.\nFirst lets install the Extension Pack for that particular VirtualBox Version. It fixes many network cases. You can find the extension pack in the Download section of VirtualBox. Your version is for OS X hosts. \nTo install it, open VirtualBox, go to the menu and select File --> Preferences. Now select Extensions and select the Add Pack button at the far right. Look for the downloaded Extension pack and add it to VirtualBox. \nYou can read this guide for detailed step-by-step with images but care, the host is ubuntu too. For example you can skip the vboxusers step.\n\nA: Virtual networking on a virtual environment holds few types which can be used according to the users need. Depending on how the network that a user requires; they can select their preferred one. But before doing so; it is better to acknowledge on the available options & what it does.\nBasic networks explained;\n\n\n*\n\n*Not attached - In this mode, VirtualBox reports to the guest that a network card is present, but that there is no connection -- as if no Ethernet cable was plugged into the card. This way it is possible to \"pull\" the virtual Ethernet cable and disrupt the connection, which can be useful to inform a guest operating system that no network connection is available and enforce a reconfiguration.\n\n*Network Address Translation (NAT) - If you're a use who need web browsing, email communication, downloading within the guest OS. Well, this is the suitable one as it look into the host OS's network and NAT it into guest OS\n\n*Bridged networking - This is for more advanced networking needs such as network simulations and running servers in a guest. When enabled, VirtualBox connects to one of your installed network cards and exchanges network packets directly, circumventing your host operating system's network stack. In simple ways, this does the same as the host OS tend to do.\n\n*Internal networking - This can be used to create a different kind of software-based network which is visible to selected virtual machines, but not to applications running on the host or to the outside world.\n\n*Host-only networking - This can be used to create a network containing the host and a set of virtual machines, without the need for the host's physical network interface. Instead, a virtual network interface (similar to a loopback interface) is created on the host, providing connectivity among virtual machines and the host.\n\n*Generic networking - Rarely used modes share the same generic network interface, by allowing the user to select a driver which can be included with VirtualBox or be distributed in an extension pack.\n\n\nThese are the common available networking types available on Virtual Box environment. You may refer Chapter 6. Virtual networking for detailed information.\nNow, by looking into your issue; I assume you will need to bridge adapter in order to get wireless working. But I'm quiet confused as to why NAT did not work as it suppose to. Further, selecting network types are located under;\n\n\n*\n\n*VirtualBox -> Select VM -> Settings -> Networking (do below);\n\n\n\nHope this helps! \n", "Q: My Laptop Won't Stay Asleep!

(Test this on your existing computer to iron out any problems before you get to the store.)\nThe staff member is usually keen to give authorisation, because he hasn't seen Ubuntu before, is curious as to how you can boot something other than Windows from a Windows computer, and knows that he's more likely to make a sale if he allows you to proceed.\n\nA: You can search forum threads (on here or ubuntuforums.org) and see what problems (if any) other users with the same computer have come across.\nAlternatively, you can check the list of Ubuntu certified hardware here .

Last I rebooted into Win8 I saw Firefox had pixel-perfect scrolling - like Ubuntu has with Nautilus, gedit and some other apps. When will Firefox for Ubuntu have scrolling that doesn't act like mouse wheel clicks?\n\nA: First, as a little background for those who don't know what pixel-perfect scrolling means. (I didn't know myself, but I did some research and want to share that here.) Usually when you scroll on a touchpad (right edge or two-finger) or a tablet device, what happens is that the X server intercepts those signals and translates them to normal mouse wheel scrolling events. While this is a straightforward, legacy-safe way to implement it and works with all applications, it doesn't provide the kind of \"smooth\" user experience you may know from, for example, Android tablets or smartphones. (Source: Jussi Pakkanen's development blog)\nNow there has been some effort on Canonical's side to ameliorate this situation. With Canonical's uTouch gesture stack combined with an X server with an up-to-date libXi (XINPUT client interface), smooth scrolling becomes possible, if the application supports it.\nIn fact, smooth scrolling was patched into Chromium using OIF Grail Library (formerly utouch-grail) and OIF Frame Library (formerly utouch-frame) about one and a half years ago. However, as far as I can see this was more of a proof-of-concept. Find more information here:\n\n\n*\n\n*Issue #9773024 on Chromium Code Reviews\n\n*ChromiumTouch on UbuntuWiki\nNow, as for the question itself: When will this make its way into Firefox? I can't give a definitive answer - in fact I suspect there is none - but I can speculate. An implementation of a gesture-recognizer in Firefox in terms of the previously mentioned technology stack would have to be implemented either (a) by the Canonical people who develop that technology stack, (then submit it to upstream Firefox as they did for Chromium), or (b) by the Firefox dev team itself.\nI guess the Firefox dev team would only do such a thing if this framework became a widely adopted standard, which so far is not the case. You might ask at the MozillaZine forums, but I suspect if you mention uTouch or Open Input Framework they won't know what the hell you're talking about ;)\nA better option would be to address the Canonical people who develop that technology, specifically, the Canonical MultiTouch project group. Browsing their site gives the impression that the project has been somewhat dormant (at least, low-activity) for something like a year. My guess -and this is but a wild guess- would be that with Canonical now working on Mir as a replacement for X, their focus may have somewhat shifted. That is, the development of these libraries interacting with X and providing multitouch features and the like, will probably be integrated in a somewhat more streamlined way into Mir.\nSo to sum it up, I would bet as much: you won't see such a feature in Firefox until Mir is actually deployed on Ubuntu. Mir is to replace X sometime after Ubuntu 14.04 \"Trusty Tahr\", so look forward to that. Now there's certainly no guarantee this will work as soon as Mir makes its way into Ubuntu. I am not involved with Mir development and I can't say where their priorities lie. However, since Canonical is quite concerned with human-computer-interaction and is even targetting tablets and smartphones now, I believe you will see such features implemented rather sooner than later. :)\n", "Q: Not showing any bootable options on grub I'm using Ubuntu 13.10 and trying to install windows 7 instead, but when I hold shift on start-up to open the grub menu, there's no other bootable options.

I have 2 PCs running Ubuntu 12.04 Desktop version connected via 1 Gigabit Ethernet switch. I would like to create a 2 node cluster and configure Torque to submit and schedule jobs on the two nodes. \nPlease note that I am not interested in running MPI type jobs across the nodes.

When you log in you can see the permissions on your home directory: \n$ ls -ld $HOME\nrwxr-xr-x 111 rmano rmano 12288 Feb 10 14:13 .\n\nrwx means that the owner can read, write and cross(1) the directory. The members of group rmano can just read and cross. The last triple specify what to do with \"others\" users. So if you do (as user): \nchmod o-rwx $HOME\n\nyou will restrict the access to all \"other\" users. (Don't do that with the group, it's not needed.

Alt+F2 doesn't provide a terminal.\nTo get poweroff (and other admin tools) to work in Alt+F2, use this:\n\n\n*\n\n*First, open a terminal (Ctrl+Alt+T) and run this command:\nsudo apt-get install gksu\n\n(It may be already installed in older versions of Ubuntu)\n\n*You can then use 'gksu' instead of 'sudo' in the Alt+F2 launcher.\n\nA: use Synapse\nit can expect and suggest command or program you want to run while you typing \ngo to packages.ubuntu website and search for [ synapse ] , install it , and enjoy \n\nA: try CTRL-ALT-T instead\nsudo shutdown -h now or sudo shutdown -P now to power off immediately. see man shutdown for more detail and options.\n", "Q: Console output headers not aligned with columns How can I make all command-line tools like arp or netstat show their output properly, so that the header line is aligned with the rest of the output?\n\n\nThe answer should not be manipulating the output itself (e.g. with column -t or similar).\n\nA: This appears to be a bug with the translation. Whoever translated this command forgot to include the right amount of spaces, or launchpad or similar trimmed off the whitespace at some point. At any rate, you should report this as bugs for both netstat and arp.\nIf you run\nLANG=C netstat | head\n\nyou should see the headers correctly aligned (in english).\n", "Q: link \"make\" command to lib and include I want to use make command and link it to the include and lib path.\nI am using :\nmake -I /path_to_include  - L /path_to_lib\n\nbut it gives me:\nnothing to be done for /path_to_lib\n\n(The path is correct.)\n\nA: You can use below “make” command to link lib and include,\nmake <filename_without_extension> LDLIBS=\"-l<lib1> -l<lib2>\"\n\nsuppose you have server1.cpp file to compile using make command,\nmake server1 LDLIBS=\"-lcpprest -lpthread -lssl -lcrypto\" LDFLAGS=\"-L/usr/lib/\" CXXFLAGS=\"-I/usr/include/\"\n\nOutput will expand the compilation command as,\ng++ -I/usr/include/  -L/usr/lib/  server1.cpp  -lcpprest -lpthread -lssl -lcrypto -o server1\n\n\nA: make does not accept options like -L /path/to/somewhere - these are arguments that need to be given to the compiler and make will not pass them on. You probably need to edit the Makefile appropriately.\nDepending on the Makefile, it will often use a variable like CFLAGS, LIBS or LDFLAGS to pass extra options to the compiler. You can set these when you run make: LIBS=-lmylib LDFLAGS=-L/path/to/mylib make. This relies on the Makefile having been written to use such variables however, which one generated by a system like autoconf probably will, but one written by hand may not.\n", "Q: Are there any wired (gaming) controllers that \"just work\" or natively support Linux/Ubuntu?

We have -generic- drivers. This means we have a driver that supports a range of printers (and if you printer fits in that range it is supprted though specific options might not be in that driver).\nThis printer works with the standard printer utility.

Can Rhythmbox do this without upsetting playcounts etc.  iTunes allows me to do this?\n\n*On the Mac/iTunes the songs ripped in ALAC or AIFF are recompressed automatically into 256 AAC files for my iPod Classic when it syncs.  This keeps the higher def sounds on the computer and a more portable format on the iPod.  I would like to continue doing this with Rhythmbox.  Is it possible?\n\nA: For the playlist:\nStep 1: Export the iTunes playlist. Simply right click the playlist and pick “Export…”. Then, save it to a text file. Move this file with your music collection to your Linux box.\nStep 2: Download the script (importpl.py, 1.5 KB) and modify the “win_path” and “lin_path” variables (lines 5 and 6) to reflect the proper paths. The script will take care of changing Windows’ backslashes to forward slashes.\nStep 3: Run the script to convert the iTunes playlist to the Rhythmbox “.pls” format. Here’s an example usage of the Python script:\n$ python importpl.py iTunesPlaylist.txt LinuxPlaylist.pls\n\nStep 4: Import your playlist into Rhythmbox. Just go to Music > Playlist > Load From File…\nFor ripping in ALAC/AIFF format: \nIt looks like it can't be done. However, there are ways you can convert to your specified formats but Rhythmbox can't do it.\nFor the recompressing:\nAccording to this user, Rhythmbox converts ALAC automatically to the (presumably) AAC format. Don't know the specifications of the format though\n\nA: For the playlists and song play counts\nA while ago I faced the same issue and wrote a script called migrate-itunes-to-rhythmbox. It will convert your playlists, play counts and ratings to Rhythmbox. You can migrate all playlists at once with just a single command. So you don't need to export each playlist one after another in iTunes and import them manually to Rhythmbox.\n", "Q: Can someone recommend a Program able to show and execute XQuery and XPath on a XML document?

If you format a partition the files are gone. On the other hand it is totally possible to format C: and not format D: where D: ends up as \"/dev/sda2\" partition you can mount.\n\ndo I need to back up what is already on an external HDD?\n\nNo. For extra safety I would advice to unplug external media.  When you plug in external hdd's Ubuntu will recognize them and mount them accordingly. Even NTFS. In the rare occasion it does not you can still mount it manually.\nA backup of personal files will be sufficient. I would advice to check upfront if you can restore the files.\nIf you jump into Ubuntu by removing Windows completely feel free but if you set up a dual boot you must shutdown your machine. Do not restart from hibernation or suspend since that will leave Windows in an unclean state (and Ubuntu will inform you about that but will refuse to mount is).\n", "Q: Disable recovery mode I'm working with Ubuntu 12.04 LTS, and in my application I turn on and turn off the system from a energy switch.

There are a lot of old guides on the net. Some work, some don't work. I need the risk to be minimal, since I am on a stable LTS machine here. \nThis is the workaround Nvidia provided me for Ubuntu 12.04.4 LTS 64-bit:\n\nIt is expected that powermizer settings are not saved after reboot.\nAs a workaround, you can set \"prefer maximum performance\" on the\n  command line with nvidia-settings -a [gpu:0]/GpuPowerMizerMode=1.\n  Replace gpu:0 with gpu:N if there is more than one GPU.\nYou can place that nvidia-settings invocation in ~/.xinitrc or some\n  other startup script. (It must be done after X is started)\n\nI recommend doing it via the \"start-up programs\" utility, because it's relatively easy and because it ships with Ubuntu 12.04 LTS. Copy and paste the command into it, save and it will load on the next restart. \nScreenshots\n1. Open the start-up program utility and add the recommended command and a comment into it:\n\n2. Activate it afterwards:\n\n3. Restart your computer and check PowerMizer via nvidia-settings:\n\nDone. Maximum power!

It was my first venture into the linux realm, and at times it was quite taxing on my soul. Hopefully I can outline clearly enough the steps I took to identify the exact issue and solve it.\nNote: All of these steps were taken successfully using Ubuntu 14.04 downloadable here: http://cdimage.ubuntu.com/daily-live/current/\nFirst thing I would do is check what driver your network card is currently using\nlspci -v\n\nLook for your network controller and check the line:\nKernel driver in use: <driver>\n\nIf your network controller is not using the wl driver, then I would next check that the wl module is installed using lsmod to list all installed modules.\nlsmod\n\nIf you do not see wl listed under the Module list, there's the problem.\nIf you do in fact see wl listed, then you most likely just need to force your network controller to use the proper driver. I think this can be done with sudo modprobe wl but I'm really not certain. Best to research some more elsewhere (Don't fret, your closer than everyone else!)\nOr you can follow these next steps and it should work as well, just with more effort than you really should have to put in.\nSo you don't have your wl module which is bad. The next step is to purge your bcmwl-kernel-source\nsudo apt-get purge bcmwl-kernel-source\n\nSince I had no internet access, I was forced to boot into the 14.04 live cd, where I could gain internet access wirelessly after opening Software & Updates going to the additional drivers tab and enabling the BCM proprietary driver.\nAfter you've done this, install the Synaptic Package Manager from the Ubuntu software center.\nThen follow these steps outlined by Sneetsher, with additional packages that I installed.\nUse live CD, Use Synaptic > Settings > Repositories: check all. Then Reload (to update package list). Check linux-firmware , linux-firmware-nonfree, bcmwl-kernel-source, dkms, all linux-headers, and all linux-image-extra for installed kernels. Then File > Generate download script. Save it in the desktop. Run it. Save packages to USB key. Reboot to installed OS, use sudo dpkg -i *.deb to install them. Reboot, see if it works?\nSee here: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/SynapticHowto for clarification on creating the script\nAfter doing this hopefully your wireless will work! If not, I'm sorry, keep researching!\n", "Q: vdpauinfo: display: :0.0 screen: 0 Error creating VDPAU device: 1 New to this community.\nI hope that someone can help me with the below.\nI am at the point that I need to get vdpau to work to offload the CPU. No luck.\nLast week my new GT610 nvidia card arrived - I had an ever so small hope that my current GT220 had a fault - installed it, and I still cannot get vdpau to work. Hence the GT220 is back in its position. \nWhat I mean is that after installing vdpauinfo the command: ~$ vdpauinfo gives:\n\ndisplay: :0.0\n  screen: 0 Error creating VDPAU device: 1\n\nThe motherboard is a Gigabyte H55M-UD2H with on-board video controller and HDMI connector which I have disabled in the BIOS using the PEG setting. (according to the BIOS this would mean that it will select an external card over the on-board one).\nI installed Ubuntu 13.04 since I had that on DVD, and downloaded and applied all the updates that came through. Checking the video driver it indicated nouveau - which is \"as expected\".\nUpon the prompt to move to 13.10 I did so.\nI then used the \"settings\" option right top corner to install the nvidia drivers - I believe I picked the top one which should include the VDPAU capbility.\nAfter that finished I stopped the X-server, opened a terminal session and generated a new Xconf file and then tried to start the X-server again. This failed and it required a hard reboot.\nMachine came back-up. I installed vdpauinfo using apt-get.\nThen I executed \"vdpauinfo\" with the result as listed above.Error creating VDPAU device: 1\"\nI have tried this numerous times over the last releases, probably as far back as 10.10, and it never worked.\nI have trawled the web pages and followed clues and advice to no avail, this is the last piece of the puzzle to have my Ubuntu based mediacentre which works like a dream apart from this bit.\nAny help in resolving this or arriving at the point why this cannot work for me is much appreciated.\nsnippet from sudo lshw output:\n\ntest-iv-medcntr\n

I have installed Windows 7 Ultimate and Red Hat Enterprise Linux as the guest operating systems. I have also installed the Virtual Box Guest Additions on Windows 7 Guest and have also configured my desired shared folder. I am able to access all the files but can't run or install any program on Windows Guest as I am always greeted with the error : \n\" The specified path does not exist. Check the path, and then try again. \"\nPlease help! Urgent. \n\nA: This is usually a problem when running .exe files from a virtual box shared folder on the windows guest. The solution is to run the .exe using UNC paths ie In your Explorer (in Windows) go to \\Vboxsvr\\your shared folder\\path\\to\\folder\\with\\exe and run the .exe from there.\nHere's some more info on that: http://compnetworking.about.com/od/windowsnetworking/g/unc-name.htm\n\nA: You only need to create a new FOLDER on the local hard drive in win 7 virtualbox it. copy and paste the programs you like in FOLDER it. After that you can install the program.\n\nA: First connect the share from Virtual box's side. Then when mapping (at least from Win7 x64 this works) tick the box that says \"other credentials.\" This solved it for me.\n", "Q: can't open advanced setting hello every one I've just installed gnome-tweak-tool by using this code\n sudo apt-get install gnome-tweak-tool\n\nAfter installing the Advanced setting icon appear in applications menu and when I tray to open it it seems that ubuntu opening it (from the top panel in gnome) but nothing happen.\nwhen I check out the problem in terminal I get this message:\n(gnome-tweak-tool:4972): GLib-GIO-ERROR **: Settings schema 'org.gnome.shell.extensions.user-theme' is not installed\n\nTrace/breakpoint trap (core dumped)\nI'm very thankful for anyone who help.\n\nA: I suspect that may not be the problem, but go to here and you should be able to install the user-themes extension it by setting the switch to ON and then pressing Install\n", "Q: l2tp, ps3mediaserver What im trying to do here are to connect to an PS3 Mediaserver, thats located remotely behind an VPN. \nthis is how my network looks like \nPS3 Mediaserver:  IP: 10.0.0.116\n\nPlaystation 3:    IP 192.168.1.116\n\nI'm connecting to the remote network, using an Drytek vigor 2920N.

My laptop boot time seems to be delayed by this message. I have a Broadcom internal wlan card installed on the laptop and a desktop without a wireless device.

I want to leave this terminal open because this gives basic information in the debugging mode.\nWhen I run this basic script in a terminal, all is fine. This only fails as this is executed for the startup application service.\nAny suggestions?\nUpdate\nOK, I edited the profile preference in gnome-terminal not to close the terminal, once the program has been executed (profile preferences->Title and Commands -> in When command exits->Hold the terminal open). I could read a message in the terminal that says during the execution of the script hasn't been found certain python libraries. By the way, the program that I want to run is a python script. Obviously, at the beginning of the python script, I put:\n#!/usr/bin/env python\n\nEven so, It is not working. I usually put certain environmental variables in the ~/.bashrc script to be called when a gnome-terminal is open. How can I source the ~/.bashrc script using /bin/sh?\n\nA: You could achieve this, I believe, with the \"sleep\" command: sleep [number] (essentially makes the terminal wait for however many seconds you put in the number field... i.e. sleep 100 would make it wait 100 seconds before closing. You could quit the terminal at any time, as well.\n", "Q: Can´t install Xampp on Ubuntu 13.10 I'm trying to install Xampp but those errors appeared when I followed some of the steps shown in other posts.\n\n\nHow can I fix this?\n\nA: To install XAMPP, just press Ctrl+Alt+T on your keyboard to open Terminal.

I followed the advice in this answer and searched for 3.2.0-58 in synaptic, selected the 4 modules that were found, right clicked and chose Mark for Removal and got this dialog\n\nIt looks like by removing 3.2.0-58 I'll remove linux itself!

Or is it too difficult / risky?\n(Apologies if this is a duplicate, I did search but the posts I found were to do with removing old kernels.)\n\nA: what are generic packages\nThose generic packages are in fact meta-packages.  This is a mechanism to allow newer kernel packages to be downloaded and automatically loaded.\nHence - you should in-fact keep these.\nsuggestions\nThe better way is to pin the kernel you wish to boot from.  Once done, you can keep booting from the older kernel - but you will also be able to see when a newer kernel arrives.  Thus you can then test out the newer kernel to see if your issue has resolved.\nAnother alternative is to test out one of the latest hardware enablement kernels - you can see if the latest kernel + latest graphics also resolves your issues.  As a side effect you often see much faster graphics and better performance.\nAs always - anything that changes BOTH your kernel and graphics can lead to issues - so make sure you take an image backup first.\nWe already have great Q&A's on both how to pin your grub entry - as well as installing the hardware enablement stack.  Thus, I wont repeat here those answer but instead guide you to click the links and view the already excellent answers there.\nAt the time of writing this, the latest hardware enablement stack is saucy\n\nLinked Questions:\n\n*\n\n*How do I change the GRUB boot order?\n\n*How to Upgrade Ubuntu 12.04.2, 12.04.3 to 12.04.4, the next Hardware Enablement Stack?\n\n*How to make a disk image and restore from it later?\n", "Q: Xubuntu: how to remove the printer icon? I'm on Xubuntu 13.10 64 bit, I printed something, now the printer icon is still up there next to the battery icon, I solve the problem by logging out and in. But I want a better solution for next time that does not require me to log out.\nEDIT: I'm having the same problem. As requested, here is a screenshot:\n\nWhen I try to click (left or right) on the printer icon, nothing happens. Only logging out and back in again clears it away.\n\nA: I had the same problem, below is how I solved it.\nJust right click on the icon, and then click Hide.  That will hide the icon, and it won't show again.  See image below.\n\n\nA: By doing the above procedure , only the icon is gone . To actually stop it from running in background , double click on the icon and a window will open . Now close all the left over print jobs ( probably left over commands or unsuccessful print commands ) . Then the icon will be gone and the printing mechanism is actually closed .\n\nA: If the icon appears due to print jobs got stuck then you can follow this \nfirstly click on the printer icon and clear/cancel any print jobs that are stuck, now kill the \"indicator-printers-service\" from terminal using following commands\n\n\n*\n\n*ps -ef | grep indicator-printers-service\n\n*kill $pid (note the pid from above command's output)\nthis should hopefully remove the icon \n", "Q: Launcher Search is showing duplicate icon I also have duplicates in my Dash (saw several questions about this subject).

I had two launchers for 'System monitors' in my Ubuntu 20.04. Both the launchers appear to be having different commands to launch but launch the same software. I recognized one having 'snap' in the command line (presumably updated via snap).\nI sorted it out by using the application 'menu editor', and slid the radio button of 'Hide from menus' to 'on' for the software devoid of 'snap'. Voila! I got rid of two enteries.\n\nA: The two are actually different. One is for Cinnamon, the other is for Unity.\nTo fix:\n\n\n*\n\n*Run this command:\nsudo -H gedit /usr/share/applications/cinnamon-session-properties.desktop\n\n\n*Find this line:\nName=Startup Applications \n\nReplace it with this (or similar):\nName=Startup Applications Cinnamon\n\n\n*Save & close the file.\n\n*The Startup Applications should now have different names.\n\n", "Q: Why upstart documentation prevents me from using respawn In documentation I found a note that I shouldn't use respawn if I satisfied with expect.\nBut I cannot understand, how are they interfere.\nFor example, nginx config using both and predictable didn't respawn if I disable the respawn stanza.\nSo, what \"confusing behaviour\" should I expect?\n\nA: It doesn't say you can't use both stanzas. It says, to paraphrase, don't include a respawn stanza until you are satisfied your expect stanza is working.\nProblems with the expect stanza can be very difficult to debug and can be quite disastrous.

However, I need to disable the write access of students and unfortunately, they are unable to scroll up, if I do so.\nI also had a look at script, but it generates a terrible output, which - even when filtered through col -bp < logfile >> output.html is unreadable.

Any larger than this and you can run into graphical issues because todays graphics cards and drivers often need a similar kernel to work with.\nI know this because my laptop is an intel based laptop.  I'm running 12.04 and running the hardware-enablement stack.\nCurrently I'm using the 13.10 saucy stack but with the raring kernel (kernel 3.8 vs 3.11 in saucy).  This works ok.  When I switch to my 3.2 kernel, my laptop boots to a black screen.\nGiven that you are using a server, I imagine you are not running any graphics stuff anyway - or maybe just framebuffer type graphics. Thus, the graphics issues should not (in theory) apply to you.\nkernel 3.2\nKernel 3.2 is the long-term supported kernel (LTS) - so it will receive the support the longest (i.e. a total 5 years from 12.04 release).\nAs long as you are not running any kernel device dependent software, there will be no impact in running an older kernel.\nThe other aspect you should consider is security updates.  By pinning and holding your kernel you'll need to manually manage your kernel updates.\npinning\nAs to your queries - the procedure you have outlined is correct.\nYou may wish to consider not \"pinning and holding\".

I just don't know the intervening steps very well.\nSomewhere along the line i seem to recall using a text editor...The hardest part was getting that text from the text editor into my Download file\nPlease dont tell me to open it up like any other zip file because i have no idea how to do that.\nthanks\n\nA: What the questioner probably meant:\n\n\n*\n\n*Movie files with hardcoded subtitles are nice.\n\n*A movie file with seperate subtitle file(s) (e.g. srt), is even better - more easily adaptable.\n\n*Zip is a practical way of packing and distributing a movie and seperate subtitle(s).\n\n*Only one problem: you can't load the movie file from the zip and load the srt from the same zip in a viewer (Media Player Classic, VLC..). So you have to extract sth or everything each time.\n\n*Hardcoding a subtitle (or a group of subtitles) in a movie means literally waiting all night for the result.\n\n*Adding/extracting a (or several) subtitle(files)/srt(s) to/from a movie should take only a few minutes in any movie file format (keeping video and audio codec as they are - streamcopy - only adding the sub).\n\n*We can pack several things in epub, which is in fact zip, and read it as 1 complete file. Why not sth similar with movies?\n\n*Or: Add/extract movie text in the same relatively fast way you would add/extract the audio part i.o.w.\n\n*Developers?...\n\n\nA: *\n\n*With archive manager installed, you can extract the zip file in any location. Later you can open it using gedit.\n\n*Make sure you have extracted the zip file with .srt or .sub where you have your movie file (Else copy from the previously extracted location to the movie file location)\nIn order to view subtitles, either drag the subtitle file onto movie file or right-click inside movie player and select subtitles from there. \n", "Q: Installing driver for Asus USB-AC56 - part 2 This was predominantly answered in this thread\nHow do I install an ASUS USB-AC56 WiFi adapter?\nUnlike the original requester the instruction provided by chili555 (sorta) works* for me, even on USB2.0 port \nThe device shows as Realtek 802.11n NIC  \nInstalled the driver I indicated in the original post from the rtl8812AU_8821AU_linux-master package (this is a revision 4.2.2 driver):\nThe Good news - again that install completes and sees the USB adapter and allows it to connect to my router;\nThe Bad news - compared to the internal adapter the measured download speed (using a browser speedtest) is only about 7Mbps vs 40Mbps (7 at best and EXTREMELY sensitive to position)   \nNow - I found however, that if I am in direct line of sight of the router, the speed comes up to normal - so somehow it appears there is potentially less power to the device, which is affecting its range?\nThe same device in the same physical location running under windows is flawless. \n1) AC56 vs internal adapter performs much slower when both at same physical location removed from direct line of sight of router\n2) In the same physical location, the AC56 performs much worse under Linux than Windows\n=> Perhaps less power to the device in Linux which is affecting its range?\n\n\n*\n\n*However the download speed is really slow:\nI only get about 1.3 Mbps on this adapter;

As far as I know Project Sputnik from Dell, it is a developer notebook with Ubuntu installed.\nThis notebook has a fan and some kernel module / driver / user land app to handle turning it on and off.\nDoes anyone could tell me which software controls the fan in this Ubuntu? Any reference.\n\nA: I answered a similar question here on askubuntu, but it concerned Dell inspiron models so I can't flag your question as a duplicate, since it's not. I don't own your notebook model, but you can try and see if this guide will help you anyway.\nI partially solved Dell fans and heating issues using i8kutils, a collection of utilities for Dell laptops. In this collection there is i8kmon, which is the utility I'm actually using right now.\n\nHow To solve Dell laptops fan issues in Ubuntu\n\n*\n\n*First of all, let's download and install i8kutils. Open your terminal and write:\n\nsudo apt-get install i8kutils\n\n\n*Now you've got to add i8k to your modules. Open the modules file:\n\nsudo gedit /etc/modules\nand add the string \"i8k\" (without quotes) to the file. Save and exit.\n\n\n*Create an i8k.conf file\nsudo vim /etc/modprobe.d/i8k.conf\nand fill it with this code:\noptions i8k force=1\nNote: Some older guides will tell you to create a /modprobe.d/options file. The \"options\" file isn't used anymore on Ubuntu. What does matter is that you create a file with a .conf extension (the filename isn't important, but I decided to name it i8k.conf for clarity). So beware of older i8kmon configuration guides.\n\n\n*Now restart your computer, or run this code to make i8k run:\n\nsudo modprobe i8k force=1\n\n\n*We will now create a i8kmon.conf file which will tell the i8kmon utility how to behave.\n\nsudo gedit /etc/i8kmon.conf\nPaste the following code in it:\n    # Run as daemon, override with --daemon option\n    set config(daemon)      0\n     \n    # Automatic fan control, override with --auto option\n    set config(auto)        1\n     \n    # Report status on stdout, override with --verbose option\n    set config(verbose) 1\n     \n    # Status check timeout (seconds), override with --timeout option\n    set config(timeout) 20\n     \n    # Temperature thresholds: {fan_speeds low_ac high_ac low_batt high_batt}\n    set config(0)   {{-1 0}  -1  40  -1  40}\n    set config(1)   {{-1 1}  30  60  30  60}\n    set config(2)   {{-1 2}  53  128  53  128}\n     \n    # For computer with 2 fans, use a variant of this instead:\n    # Temperature thresholds: {fan_speeds low_ac high_ac low_batt high_batt}\n    # set config(0) {{-1 0}  -1  52  -1  65}\n    # set config(1) {{-1 1}  41  66  55  75}\n    # set config(2) {{-1 1}  55  80  65  85}\n    # set config(3) {{-1 2}  70 128  75 128}\n     \n    # end of file\n\nThis has been edited to match my Dell Inspiron 15r 5521 fan configuration, but you should be able to change these settings for your particular needs. If you want more informations take a look at the documentation on Ubuntu Manuals: http://manpages.ubuntu.com/manpages/gutsy/man1/i8kmon.1.html\n\n\n*Now you should be able to run i8kmon from your terminal and see if (and how) it's working. Simply run:\n\ni8kmon\nFinished!\n\nSources:\n\n*\n\n*Keenformatics -  How to solve Dell laptops fan issues in Ubuntu (my blog)\n\n\nA: I have a Dell XPS 13 (2013 edition, the 2015+ edition may be different). The fan is primarily controlled by BIOS. It appears invisible to almost any Ubuntu software.\nIt responds to i8kutils commands, e.g. i8kfan 2 2 makes it run fast, but after a few seconds any i8kutils commends apparently get overwritten by BIOS (I have BIOS version A08 rev 0.1 according to \"sudo dmidecode -s bios-version\"), and i8kmon does not realise it. I am not aware of any way to stop BIOS from doing this, and that is a shame, because BIOS never keeps fan speed high for a long time. Rather, it appears to regulate the CPUs down. The reason might be that the fan would break when running high for a long time, and Dell are just too ashamed to tell us!? \n", "Q: \"show desktop\" with \"hot corners\" not working! The function SHOW DESKTOP when moving mouse to the HOT CORNERS in ubuntu 13.04 worked.\nAfter updating to 13.10, SHOW DESKTOP/HOT CORNERS only works until rebooting or setsid unity, after which it doesn't work.\nI thought that something was wrong in the update to 13.10, so I made a clean install of ubuntu 14.04 to find out that the same issue exists.\nWhat can I do to make SHOW DESKTOP/HOT CORNERS work again?\nI have already tried to reset compiz and unity, and I did fresh install.\n\nA: A temporary solution until the bug has been fixed, could be to use xdotool.\n\n\n*\n\n*install:\nsudo apt-get install xdotool\n\n\n*in compiz config manager, under General Settings, insert a command line\nxdotool key super+d\n\n\n*in edge bindings, configure the hot corner\nWorks for me. Ubuntu 14.04\n\nA: *\n\n*Open CompizConfig Settings Manager  \n\n*Under CATEGORY choose Desktop\n\n*You will see \"Ubuntu Unity Plugin\"\n\n*On the rightmost tab called \"Switcher\" uncheck SHOW LIVE PREVIEWS OF WINDOWS IN THE SWITCHER  as Ivanyosan suggests above  \n\n\nA: Ubuntu 14.04 is currently still in development - it will not be available properly until April 2014. You don't need to upgrade to it yet :-).\nAnyway, using unity-tweak-tool, set this...\n\n..and you should be able to show & hide the desktop by placing the mouse in the lower-right corner - it works very nicely in 13.10.\n\nA: I was able to solve the problem by brute force. \nMoving every single option in CompizConfig Settings Manager I did find that when Unity was disabled then Show Desktop works as expected with the HOT CORNERS.\nSo i click every single checkmark in Ubuntu Unity Plugin to finally find that Show Live Previews of Windows in the Switcher was the one to blame. (After unchecking it hot corners works as expected.\n\nA: Unfortunately these fixes work on some computers and not on others.  I personally haven't found any change when unticking the Compiz Untiy Plugin under \"Switcher\" tab.  It doesn't seem to make a difference.  So the problem still remains on one of my older desktop computers that no method above would work.  So I tried a different approach and it seems to work on every computer and is very consistent.  Here is what I did.\nFirst make a bash script.  To do this create a \"New Document\" from your right click menu and choose \"Empty Document\".  In this new document paste this:\n#!/bin/sh\nsleep 3\ncompiz --replace\n\nNow save this file as \"compiz-start\".  Make sure to set its permissions to \"Allow executing file as program\" ticked and move this file to /usr/bin/.  You may also want to change to ownership to ROOT if you haven't already.\nNow create a .desktop file to trigger this script.  First right click and choose \"New Document\" then \"Empty Document\".  Open this file and paste the follow text into it:\n[Desktop Entry]\nType=Application\nExec=compiz-start\nHidden=false\nNoDisplay=false\nX-GNOME-Autostart-enabled=true\nName[en_US]=compiz-trigger-start.desktop\nName=compiz on start\nComment[en_US]=compiz on startup\nComment=compiz on startup\n\nSave this file. It should save automatically as \"compiz-trigger-start.desktop\".  Move this .desktop file to either your home autostart folder ~/.config/autostart (which will only work for the user) or place it into /etc/xdg/autostart which should make this fix work for all users of the system (or future new users).\nThis has worked for me on all computers that it was tested on...even the one that previously nothing had worked.  You can tell that it works because just after the Desktop loads and the Unity bar shows up; the screen will reload itself...which is Compiz restarting.  The \"sleep 3\" is critical to this working.\nI hope that help you guys fix this \"hot corners\", \"Show Desktop\", \"Spread Windows\".\nChris\n\nA: To make \"Toggle Desktop\" work for example with unity-tweak-tool here the solution:\n\nUncheck \"Show live previews of windows in the Switcher\" under the tab\n  \"Switcher\" of the Ubuntu Unity Plugin\n\nYou'll find the Ubuntu Unity Plugin under the CompizConfig Setting Manager.\nType ccsm in the Terminal.\nFound the solution here.\n\nA: I did uncheck SHOW LIVE PREVIEWS OF WINDOWS IN THE SWITCHER as Ivanyosan said. But it still doesn't work for me. \n  After unchecking the whole Ubuntu unity plugin and then check it again, CCSM will show a lot of warring that other plugins have same function as the Ubuntu unity plugin does. Then choose to use Ubuntu unity plugin instead of other plugins. That works for me on ubuntu 1404.\n", "Q: Dell Latitude D630 wireless issues running Ubuntu 13.10 I just installed Ubuntu 13.10 on my Dell Latitude D630.

I don't honestly know how I managed it.  Is there any chance that updating Win8 to Win8.1 via the Microsoft Store would break my dual installation?\n\nA: Such an upgrade shouldn't damage the Linux installation (but I don't guarantee that), but it will almost certainly set the Windows boot loader as the default. This will necessitate restoring GRUB (or whatever you're using as a boot manager) as the default boot program. You can do this in Windows via the bcfg command, in Linux with the efibootmgr utility, or in various other ways.\n", "Q: System error dialog box keeps popping up Randomly when I am using my computer a dialog pops up saying \"Ubuntu 12.04 has found an error in your system.

The issue here is that when I uninstall my AMD drivers to get the open source one I am getting some display issues. \nMy screen get divided in a bunch of tiny blocks that represent my desktop.\nSo what can I do?\n\nA: The command-line console is your friend.

But I'm sure there are dozens of other things to consider....\nTo use an analogy, in general is Ubuntu Touch more like Microsoft Surface Pro (Windows) or Microsoft Surface (Windows RT)?\n\nA: My understanding is that by default, the filesystem is read-only and thus you can't run apt-get, gem, npm, or any other tool that modifies the system portion of the filesystem.\nHowever, there is a way (I don't remember exactly, it has something to do with writing to a special file) to make the filesystem writeable and then you should be able to use any command-line tool you would be able to use on the regular Ubuntu desktop.\nThere is a reason though that it is read-only by default - to enable the use of Ubuntu Touch's image-based updates, which is a super-efficient way to only download a known set of changes, and should be much faster than apt-get update and apt-get diet-upgrade. I don't know whether this would work if you make the file system writable and if it doesn't work how you would then update your device.\n", "Q: How to only allow to boot from cd? I want to boot from live cd but I can't get anything to work. Only goes to HDD. Tried all the buttons at startup. Is there a way to ONLY boot from cd drive?\n\nA: For a PPC\nAt startup try the following key combo for a PPC G4 Command-Option-Shift-Delete this will bypass the device that is selected in the Startup Disk control panel; boot from the first bootable device other than that.\nYou can also try to boot in open firmware Command+Option+O+F\nthen enter boot hd:,\\install\\yaboot\nThis should then allow you to boot the CD using yaboot \nNot sure if this is pertinent to PPC G4 but another option is to hold down the 'C' key as you turn the power on. Once you hear the CD drive reading the disk you can release the key. \nFor a PC\nWhen your computer first comes on hit the Delete key or F2 or F12 key a few times, to launch into the BIOS (This step might be different from machine to machine). Inside this screen look for Boot order or maybe Boot Sequence and set the first device in the list to the CD-ROM device.\nFor example the screen shown below you would use the Delete key, take note of which key your BIOS requires you to press.\n\nThen the BIOS screen may look something like these the first is an Award BIOS where you would navigate to Advance BIOS Features the second is a Pheonix BIOS where you would navigate to the Boot tab. Again the screens you see may vary depending on your motherboard manufacturer. With both of the BIOS variants listed you would use the + and - keys to change the value of the First Boot Device, then key F10 to Save in the case of the Award BIOS and Save and Exit in the Phoenix BIOS.\n\n\n", "Q: How do I install kivy?

How do you do that. Ubuntu and Xubuntu has gotten too big for just one CD.  I prefer to use CD not DVD. Many older machine do not have DVD capability or not USB bootable.  So how can I get Ubuntu on several CDs.  Is there some way to do this???  Will Ubuntu make a both CD and DVD iso options?? \n\nA: Yes, there is an alternative: the official Ubuntu Minimal CD, that weights only 30mb https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Installation/MinimalCD#A32-bit_PC_.28x86.29\nThis particular officially supported image is really small, and will download the data required to perform the installation (instead of having it within the CD). The ISO is really light weights at most 30Mb (~25Mb for standard machines) so you won't have the size problem to burn it in a CD. Of course, the counter is that you must be connected to internet in order to perform the install. Also notice that for Ubuntu's older than 13.04 this .iso can only be burned in a CD, and won't boot from an USB stick. \nLast, this is a \"flavor\" of the alternate install, that means no  graphical interphase (no fancy windows taking you smoothly through the install process). It is an old-school (windows xp like) installer.

After that start your VM and you should be able to use VPN network.\n\nA: Had the same problem. Here is how I solved it:\n\n\n*\n\n*Change the network type of Guest System to be \"Host Only\"\n\n*Make the default gateway of Guest point to Host's ip ifconfig vboxnet0 to find it.\n\n\nLast step is routing the packets coming from vboxnet0 into your VPN.\nIf you route all traffic through VPN:\niptables -t nat -A POSTROUTING -s 192.168.5.0/24 ! -d 192.168.5.0/24 -o tun0 -j SNAT --to-source 10.8.0.5\n\nWhere 10.8.0.5 is your tun0 gateway and 192.168.5.0/24 is your vboxnet0 network range.\nIf you only route certain traffic through VPN:\niptables -t nat -A POSTROUTING -s 192.168.5.0/24 ! -d 192.168.5.0/24 -o tun0 -j SNAT --to-source 10.8.0.5\niptables -t nat -A POSTROUTING -s 192.168.5.0/24 ! -d 192.168.5.0/24 -o wlan0 -j SNAT --to-source 192.168.43.95\n\nWhere 10.8.0.5 is your tun0 gateway and 192.168.43.95 is your wlan0's gateway and 192.168.5.0/24 is your vboxnet0 network range.\nNote: This solution allow Guest OS be treated in same way Host OS is treated. Only IPs configured to go through VPN in Host OS will go through it in Guest.\n\nA: This will not work in a Bridged Networking setup. From the VirtualBox documentation:\n\nBridged networking\nThis is for more advanced networking needs such as network simulations \n  and running servers in a guest. When enabled, VirtualBox\n  connects to one of your installed network cards and exchanges network\n  packets directly, circumventing your host operating system's network\n  stack.\n\nSince your virtual machines are using eth0 directly, they are unaware of the tun0 interface to the tunnel running over it. You will need to use a different virtual networking configuration.\nYou have (among others) these options:\n\n\n*\n\n*Network Address Translation (NAT) is by far the simplest solution. VirtualBox will NAT the VMs across whatever internet connection is available to the host. This is fully transparent to the VMs. However this precludes connections from the host to the VMs or connections between the VMs.\n\n*Use Host-only Networking to create a proper subnet containing the VMs and the host. This will require no changes in the interface configuration you now have in the VMs, but you will need to set up the host to be the gateway and router, and make it NAT the VMs to the outside (whether across its eth0 or tun0).\n\n*Combine the above: give each VM two interfaces, one gatewaying to the outside world (across VirtualBox's NAT) and the other attached to the Host-Only LAN.\n\n*Try VirtualBox's experimental NAT Networking configuration.  Update 2019: this feature has since matured: attach to the host's NAT and choose the Paravirtualized network (virtio-net) adapter type.\n\nA: Here is some useful info for vagrant boxes using host vpn.\nBasically you need to set natdnshostresolver1 option\nNote that this will NOT work when using the Vagrant's public_network setting though.\n  config.vm.provider :virtualbox do |vb|\n      # ---- other options....\n      vb.customize [\"modifyvm\", :id, \"--natdnshostresolver1\", \"on\"]\n  end\n\nhttp://renier.morales-rodriguez.net/post/90674523562/sharing-host-vpn-with-virtualbox-guest\nhttp://blog.geekslikeshinythings.com/2016/05/sharing-host-vpn-with-vagrant-rob-allen.html\n\nA: After looking for this solution everywhere, I finally found a working solution that doesn't require a lot of configuration changes and is really simple.

Easy.\nHowever I cannot log into Ubuntu from the Mac -> Go -> Connect to Server, tap in the IP address of the Ubuntu Laptop.

Instead, you should set an SSH server up as discussed in the SSH guide and configure a VNC server that you can start in so-called once mode.\"\ni.e. it says absolutely nothing about VNC and instead sends you on a never-ending trail of SSH Servers, port forwarding and RSA Keys.

Based upon user choice, the device-specific option code is then inserted into the PostScript job and sent to the printer. This can be used to tell the printer to duplex or staple the print job, or tell it what paper tray to draw paper from. NOTE: gpr will detect if the file to be print is postscript, and, if not, it will call a2ps to preprocess it before sending it to ppdfilt and to lpr.\n\n", "Q: Problem with Mahjongg in Ubuntu 12.04 Ok I have a problem with the game Mahjongg. It's the GNOME version of the game that comes by default in Ubuntu and other distros, but when I used the ricotz testing ppa aka the \"GNOME Shell\" ppa and updated my system Mahjongg would no longer launch. I tried uninstalling and installing the package from Synaptic, but I think I have to purge it and then install it.\nSo it boils down to; How do I purge and reinstall Mahjongg from the terminal.\n\nA: Assuming that the solution is to purge and reinstall as you suggest:\nGenerally, the command to purge a program foo is sudo apt-get purge foo, or sudo apt-get remove --purge foo. So for this case (the package in question is gnome-mahjongg) you need sudo apt-get purge gnome-mahjongg, which will also uninstall the mahjongg package (these are two separate packages, but mahjongg depends on gnome-mahjongg.\nAlternatively, in Synaptic, you can choose the option \"Mark for complete removal\", this is synonymous with purge.\nThen, you can just reinstall as usual (i.e. sudo apt-get install mahjongg or simply install via Synaptic)\nIf this still doesn't work, an alternative would be the KDE Mahjongg game, kmahjongg, which can be installed simply by typing sudo apt-get install kmahjongg.\n", "Q: How to create shortcut on ubuntu to open a terminal with some folder?

The php5 5.4.23-1+sury.org for raring was removed from the PPA.\nHere's what the PPA looked like on Dec 16, 2013 : http://web.archive.org/web/20131216111917/https://launchpad.net/~ondrej/+archive/php5-oldstable\nYou can see that at that time there was a raring package for php5 in the PPA. This is what your other servers have installed. If you look at it today, that package is not there. Ubuntu will not remove a package that has been installed; so your other servers will still have it.\nThe reason for removing that package from the PPA is probably because Ubuntu 13.04 has ran out of support. It stopped receiving updates in January.

So I cannot run updates or reinstall.\nI tried all options in recovery mode. Enable networking is not working.\nI can think of something like this:\n1. enable networking\n2. reinstall boot loader stuff (GRUB, upload, ...)\n\nA: I had the same problem. A google search indicates that many people seem to have this problem, and I don't see solutions. Startpar starts runlevel scripts in parallel, so is there to speed up the booting process. It is part of the sysvinit package, which is marked as essential. This means it is hard to remove or substitute, which was one of my first ideas. \nI spent several hours extensively searching and trying to remove this problem in order to have my system boot again. I even downloaded and compiled the sysvinit repository, compiled it and replace my existing binary in /sbin/ with the built one (v0.58->v0.59), but I noticed that this svn repository was not very new. All this to no avail. \nI ended up downgrading my system again by doing a reinstall from live-CD.

I tried to completely remove and re-install Minitube for personal issues and I did it with:\nsudo apt-get remove --purge minitube-*\n\nBut after re-installation I got all history and subscriptions back. From where did it withdraw this config? How can I make it look clean as it's like was installed for the first time?\n\nA: apt-get remove will only remove files declared as part of the package installation, not your data files. Your data files are somewhere in your home directory, usually in a hidden directory. Look for a directory named .minitube or something similar (yes, it starts with a dot). Use ls -la to list all files, including hidden ones.\nOnce you find it, you can remove it with rm -rf .minitube (or whatever the directory name is).\n", "Q: Kazam shortcut keys not working in Gnome 3 I am using Gnome 3.10 on the top of Ubuntu 13.10 and the stock kazam screencaster coming with Ubuntu (1.4.3-0ubuntu1).\nKazam works properly, however the start/pause/finish shortcuts are not working at all.

I want to backup my Xubuntu using Clonezilla, but I want to exclude some folders, like pictures. Is it possible to exclude some folders from being backed up on Clonezilla?\nI have 18gb of music, 20 gb of movies and 12gb of ebooks that are already backed up elsewhere, is it possible to exclude them from being backed up in clonezilla?\n\nA: No, that would defeat the idea of \"cloning\". Cloning is intended to have you end up with an exact copy. \n\nCLONING » The process of duplicating either an individual partition or the contents of an entire hard drive onto a new hard drive. After cloning, the destination drive/partition will look identical to the source.\n\n\nA: It must be possible, because they have an option to do exactly that for Windows hibernation and page files.  Unfortunately they don't seem to have it plumbed through to the UI, so you can't specify arbitrary files that it should ignore.  Might be worth a feature request.  I can see it being useful for backing up the OS without having to include all the data.\nYou might also see if mondorescue works on your system.  It is similar to clonezilla in capabilities, but is file-based and allows programming excludes.  It's a bit pickier about the system configuration though.\n\nA: If you really want to do this, I think it boils down to keeping your personal files separate from your system image backup, by backing them up in different ways.\nClonezilla creates more of a \"system image\" and it should be kept separate from your personal files and how you back them up.  The reason for this is if you find yourself one day needing to restore the personal files to a separate computer, you can do so without worrying about the program and os files that you would need to operate your machine (instead you would just reinstall these on the other machine) and then you would have your personal files restored there.\nNow what method do we use for keeping the OS and program files in the system image backup and the personal files in some other backup system (such as bareos or bacula)?  Mounts, partitions, and LVM are all options for keeping these separate...for instance...\nIf your /home/ directory is where you keep your personal files, and is mounted on either a separate partition or LVM Logical Volume at boot time, when you make your system image, you can be sure that it isn't included in the system partition that contains /; that way when you run Clonezilla from a live USB to create a system image, you can choose to only back up the partitions that include the OS and program files, and not the partition or LVM Logical volume that contains your personal files, thus making the Clonezilla system image much smaller.  And since you backed up the personal files separately, you can restore them the same way when migrating or doing disaster recovery on the same system.\n", "Q: How to get Drivers for Lenovo Essential E4325 I have Windows 8 installed on my Lenovo E4325 Laptop... I want to install Ubuntu as a dual boot... Please anyone let me know do i need to install any additional drivers or are the drivers comes with the OS after installing the Ubuntu version...If Yes, How?\n\nA: On Linux, for mainstream hardware that has been on the market for some months, there's almost never need to install any drivers.\nI'd recommend you run a live system from thumbdrive oder DVD and test everything. Your Ubuntu installation medium should allow this. Connect to your wifi, test ethernet, the usb ports, the touch pad and I guess it should work.\nCheck out the support for your external hardware like printers or scanners.\n", "Q: Windows crashed and i cant boot into windows recovery disk or installer. pc boots into ubuntu. i can access windows partition from ubuntu I am dual booting Ubuntu 13.10 and Windows 7.

If you are installing them from an upstream source into ~/.local/share/gedit/plugins/ then you should contact the upstream developers of the plug-ins to get them ported to Python 3.x.\nI don't know of a specific guide to porting plug-ins for GEdit to Python 3.x, but any general guide to porting from Python 2.x to Python 3.x should help. Ideally, the plug-ins should work with either one, but the design of the plug-ins system used by GEdit and several other GNOME applications does not allow plug-in authors to do that easily. The 2to3 script should give some hints about what to change in the plug-in code, and the python-six library can be used for compatibility between both versions.\n", "Q: Terminal command prompt missing I'm using Ubuntu 12.04. The command prompt (username@desktop:~$) in Terminal went missing.\nHow do I get it back?\nThanks\nSolved by searching.\nI'm just a week new to Linux.\nThank you very much Olli and Wolfgang Vogl for your quick responses and great information, but it didn't fix my problem. If I could have gained root access, which is normally done through the Terminal (where I couldn't see what I was typing), I probably could have fixed the problem by removing the \"#\" from the \"force_color_prompt=yes\" command line, and then setting the colors to whatever I wanted.\nI've read numerous blogs, sites, etc. about missing command prompts, and most referred to the .bashrc file which allows you to configure the color of the command prompt sections, just as Olli and Wolfgang stated.\nI created a new user account, ensured that it's Terminal worked properly, and it did. Then I compared it's .bashrc file to the accounts .bashrc file that didn't work. They were the same.\nI kept searching and found the solution at\nHow to reset the terminal properties and preferences?, answered by aneeshep.\nI couldn't believe how easy it was to fix. \nThe problem was that I had changed my background theme to one of my own which also changed other sections of that user's account profile, namely the Terminal.\nWith my background theme, I couldn't see the File, Edit, etc. menu bar for the Terminal. Also, with the Terminal not maximized, I didn't realize the menu bar at the very top of the screen was for the Terminal.\nTo fix it, just navigate to Edit > Profile Preferences. Select the Colors tab, and configure the colors as needed.\nI've read about numerous other people having the same problem, and I'm sure they just changed their background theme.\nIf the resolution was just a little easier to find.\nI want to thank aneeshep, Olli and Wolfgang Vogl again.\nThanks.\n\nA: See this post.\nThe command prompt should be in PS1, you can set it by running this command:\nPS1='${debian_chroot:+($debian_chroot)}\\u@\\h:\\w\\$'\n\nIf you want this to be the default when you open a new terminal, you can put it to your ~/.profile or in /etc/bash.bashrc (global for all users).\nTo check your current prompt, just echo it:\nwolfgang@wolfgang-desktop:~$ echo $PS1\n\\[\\e]0;\\u@\\h: \\w\\a\\]${debian_chroot:+($debian_chroot)}\\u@\\h:\\w\\$\n\n", "Q: Crunch created a very large dictionary I am using crunch to create a dictionary, which will contain all combinations for 8 characters.

I keep trying to install programs, by simply downloading the program, and clicking on it, but I see things are not that simple. Has anyone come up with a simple way to install different programs, without having to rely on Synaptic or Aptitude?\nExample: I tried to install a .deb package. Went to the site, downloaded the package, opened up the command line (after making the file executable), the errors began. First there was a dependency file that was required, then there was a public key that was needed, man can someone make this a little bit simpler for a newbie.

It's likely that the server is set up to not accept password authentication. Mine wouldn't ask you for a password either.\n\nA: Try to log in with Public Key Authentification disabled, using \nssh -o PubkeyAuthentication=no root@newserver\n\n\nA: Most probably you have more than one identityfile lines on your .ssh/config file.\nEven if you have identityfile under host configuration, it is applied globally. What that means is that ssh tries every identity file (i.e public key) on every host, before it asks for password prompt from the server.\nYou can fix this by\n\n\n*\n\n*Removing all but one identityfile lines, or\n\n*Adding PubkeyAuthentication no to .ssh/config, or\n\n*Executing ssh with -o PubkeyAuthentication=no parameter.\n\n\nFrom man 5 ssh_config:\nPubkeyAuthentication\n    Specifies whether to try public key authentication.  The argument to this\n    keyword must be “yes” or “no”.  The default is “yes”.  This option applies \n    to protocol version 2 only.\n\nIdentityFile\n    ...\n    It is possible to have multiple identity files specified in configuration\n    files; all these identities will be tried in sequence.  Multiple \n    IdentityFile directives will add to the list of identities tried (this \n    behaviour differs from that of other configuration directives).\n\n\nSome general instructions with public keys:\n\n\n*\n\n*In general, you should have only a single private key per client (workstation), and put matching public key to all servers that client should have access to. In other words, share public key between servers, and never use same private key on multiple devices.\n\n*Always generate keypair on your device, and transmit only public key. That way, even if server is compromised, your private key is still safe and secure. This could happen in surprising ways - for example, through backups.\n\n*If someone else administrates the server, you should provide a public key for them; they should not generate keypair and send private key to you. That way, they can't impersonate you with your key (of course, usually they can do whatever they want to). Also, with public key, only integrity (i.e someone did not change the public key) must be protected; with private key, confidentiality (i.e no-one else obtained the key) must be conserved, and it is not possible to be absolutely sure it was not compromised.\n\n*Compromising a server does not compromise other servers, even if you use same private key for connecting to multiple servers (except if you transmitted that private key to the server. Never do that.)\n\n*Compromising your workstation will expose your private keys anyway. Having multiple private keys does not help with this (except if you have different, strong passphrases, and not all of those are available for attacker).\n\n\nThere is some exceptions to this, but not too many.\n\nA: In my experience, I found that a parameter was commented out in /etc/pam.d/sshd , as below.\n#  diff cwe-pam-sshd /etc/pam.d/sshd\n3c3\n< auth       include      password-auth\n---\n> #auth       include      password-auth\n\n\nA: Another cause I found. I had:\nHost *\n   PreferredAuthentications publickey\n\nin ~/.ssh/config (copied from another user, thinking it was \"preference\"). Actually PreferredAuthentications specifies \"allowed\" methods and order.\nEither delete the PreferredAuthentications line or add password\nHost *\n   PreferredAuthentications publickey,password\n\nNote: No space after the comma!\n", "Q: How to set up a root cron job properly I tried to set up a root cron job to run a Bash script as root, to run at minute 7,37, every hour, every day of month, every month. This script is located in /usr/bin and named tunlrupdate.sh. It updates the DNS of Tunlr.\n$ ls -l /usr/bin/tunlrupdate.sh \n-rwxr-xr-x 1 root root 2133 Sep 24 15:42 /usr/bin/tunlrupdate.sh\n\nThis Bash script is available here.\nWhen invoked the script writes what's happening in a log located in /var/log/tunlr.log\nTo add this root cron job I used the standard for root's crontab\nsudo crontab -e\n\nAnd inserted these 2 lines at the end. I expect cron to run the script as root.\n# check for updated Tunlr DNS every 30 minutes at the hour + 7 mn and hour + 37 mn\n07,37 * * * * root /usr/bin/tunlrupdate.sh\n\nA later command sudo crontab -l confirmed that the cron job has been inserted.\nI did reboot Ubuntu and was checking in the log file if the cron job was launched properly. However there is nothing in the logfile /var/log/tunlr.log meaning the job was never successfully launched.\nI did check that if I run the script from the command line\nsudo /usr/bin/tunlrupdate.sh\n\nthen the logfile is updated accordingly.\nWhy is this cron job not running as planned in my system?\nUPDATE 1 : All the proposed solutions so far do not work. I thank Olli for a CLI to list the system log sudo grep CRON /var/log/syslog. However I did get a CRON error\nCRON[13092]: (root) CMD (  [ -x /usr/lib/php5/maxlifetime ] && [ -d /var/lib/php5 ]\n&& find /var/lib/php5/ -depth -mindepth 1 -maxdepth 1 -type f -cmin +$(/usr/lib/php\n/maxlifetime) ! -execdir fuser -s {} 2>/dev/null \\; -delete)\n\nwith the suggested PATH= insertion & use of absolute path from root for functions in the script or without this suggested solutions here. I still get this error.\nAfter some searching I pinpointed the error in the file /usr/lib/php5/maxlifetime as is explained here: Change #!/bin/sh -e --> #!/bin/sh -x\nThen listing the CRON error log in my system\nsudo grep CRON /var/log/syslog\nFeb 11 18:07:01 Marius-PC CRON[14067]: (root) CMD (root /usr/bin/tunlrupdate.sh)\nFeb 11 18:07:01 Marius-PC CRON[14066]: (root) MAIL (mailed 1 byte of output; but got\nstatus 0x00ff, #012)\n\nI still don't get the bash script executing. This time no error is shown in the log. To get assurance this was not the content of the script I reduced the script to the following 3 lines:\n#!/bin/bash\nLOGFILE=/var/log/tunlr.log\necho $LOGFILE >> $LOGFILE\n\nI still don't get the cron job through. Nothing is written in the log file. So even may be an empty script will not run in cron ? I don't get it. I am know trying a script reduced to these 2 lines:\n#!/bin/bash\nexit 0\n\nAnd still the same error log. The cron script does not go through ...\n\nA: If you want to run a script as a normal user:\ncrontab -e\n\nAnd add the line:\n07,37 * * * * /usr/bin/tunlrupdate.sh\n\nIf you want to run your script as root:\nsudo crontab -e\n\nAnd add the same line:\n07,37 * * * * /usr/bin/tunlrupdate.sh\n\n\nA: One \"problem\" with cron is that lack of environment variables (for obvious security reasons). You are probably missing PATH and HOME. You can define those in the script directly or in the crontab file.\n# check for updated Tunlr DNS every 30 minutes at the hour + 7 mn and hour + 37 mn\nPATH=/usr/bin\n07,37 * * * * root /usr/bin/tunlrupdate.sh\n\nYou'll have to test until all the necessary variables are defined as required by the script.\n\nA: Well, at last the working solution. In the syslog I saw the repetitive and intriguing:\nCRON[18770]: (root) CMD (root /usr/bin/tunlrupdate.sh)\n\nThat sounds like root was not recognized as a cmd. As I already used the root's cron by using $ sudo /usr/bin/tunlrupdate.sh. Then I tried with the original script (corrected for a mistake in the date UNIX cmd : %m which is month was used for minutes which is %M) the following (which removes the root from the cron line):\n$ sudo crontab -e\n# check for updated Tunlr DNS every 30 minutes at the hour + 7 mn and hour + 37 mn\n07,37 * * * * /usr/bin/tunlrupdate.sh\n\nThis turned out to be the final solution. [Although I found scores of literature stating the erroneous line with root in the cron line. That was a mistake].\n\nA: Cron error messages are usually - by default - sent via email. You can check whether there's email for root with sudo mail, or by just checking contents of /var/mail/root, e.g sudo less /var/mail/root.\n\nIf email messages does not help, also check /var/log/syslog:\nsudo grep CRON /var/log/syslog\n\n\nAs Alexis Wilke already said, cron have different mechanism for setting environment variables.\nYour script needs\nPATH=/sbin:/bin:/usr/bin\n\nto the crontab. HOME shouldn't be necessary. You should use absolute paths in your scripts, e.g /bin/date instead of date. You can find proper paths for each command with  which command_name, e.g\n$ which date\n/bin/date\n\n\nA: You can add this line in your script. So after you check the cron logs and comprove your job was executed you can get the the same $PATH of crontabs had.\n/bin/echo $PATH > /root/path.txt\n\nAnd probably the best thing you can do to diagnose issues in cron scripts is get all the environment variables of SO with env command in your script. So just add this line to your script. Then you can analyze the output allEvnVars.txt\n/usr/bin/env > /root/allEvnVars.txt\n\nAnother trick is to direct the output of the script to some place. Adding the /root/log.log. This way all the output of the script will be maintained in /root/log.log\n07,37 * * * * root /usr/bin/tunlrupdate.sh  > /root/log.log\n\nAlso you can schedule the script to run each min to facilitate the tests and checks.\n*/1 * * * * root /usr/bin/tunlrupdate.sh  > /root/log.log\n\n\nA: You state in your question that you reduced the script to:\n#!/bin/bash\nLOGFILE=/var/log/tunlr.log\necho $LOGFILE >> $LOGFILE\n\nI have had problems with this before. It turned out to be the first line. Instead of #!/bin/bash I tried #!/bin/sh and that worked (for me, at least). \n", "Q: Broadcom BCM4321 cannot find networks I've spend a couple of hours now trying to get my wifi card working.

I was doing some experimentation with a test charm on Juju on AWS and managed to get my service in to a completely hung state.  juju service returns the following.\nenvironment: amazon\nmachines:\n  \"0\":\n    agent-state: started\n    agent-version: 1.16.5\n    dns-name: xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx\n    instance-id: i-7c2f4c52\n    instance-state: running\n    series: precise\n    hardware: arch=amd64 cpu-cores=1 cpu-power=100 mem=1740M root-disk=8192M\n  \"5\":\n    agent-state: down\n    agent-state-info: (started)\n    agent-version: 1.16.5\n    instance-id: i-9cb9cbb2\n    instance-state: missing\n    series: precise\n    hardware: arch=amd64 cpu-cores=1 cpu-power=100 mem=1740M root-disk=8192M\nservices:\n  metest:\n    charm: local:precise/metest-0\n    exposed: false\n    life: dying\n    relations:\n      cluster:\n      - metest\n    units:\n      metest/0:\n        agent-state: down\n        agent-state-info: (started)\n        agent-version: 1.16.5\n        life: dying\n        machine: \"5\"\n        open-ports:\n        - 80/tcp\n        public-address: xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx\n\n(I've removed the DNS names just in case!).  The instance-id for machine 5 has been terminated according to the AWS management console.  None of \"destroy-unit metest/0\", \"destroy-service metest\" and \"destroy-machine 5\" clear the problem, and I can't redeploy the service with it in this state.  juju resolve seems to have no effect either.\nGoogling the issue, the only resolution I can find is to completely blow away my environment - which is not a great option.  Is there any way I can clear the problem otherwise?  What is the general method for debugging this kind of issue?\nThe root cause of the problem: We use Chef for most of our orchestration and have found that occasional failure between Chef and AWS API leave orphaned instances around. Since all the instances we launch from Chef are tagged with a name, and these orphaned instances are unnamed, to avoid giving Amazon money needlessly we added code to our knife plugins to terminate unnamed instances. I'm sure you can see where this is going ... \nIs there any way to clean up machines once they are in this state (--force doesn't help) - and I would also like to know if there are any plans to allow instances to be named so they are identifiable in the EC2 management console (something like juju-- would be ideal)?\nThings I have tried:\n\n\n*\n\n*destroy-machine --force doesn't seem to clean things up. I don't get an error, but it appears like nothing changed in the status.\n\n\nA: You could try:\njuju destroy-machine --force 5\nThe --force option of destroy-machine is available since 1.16.5 and should remove the hung machine and all units on it. Then you should be able to redeploy your service, but if it says \"service already exists\" just deploy it with a different name.\nIf all else fails, juju destroy-environment -e <name> is always an option. I'm not sure if it did support --force as well in 1.16.5.\n\nA: I had similar kind of situation and I issued \"juju resolved \" (or in case of service, you can give \"juju resolved \". That solved the problem. \nPlease have a look at \"Caveats\" section of \"Removal within Juju\"\n", "Q: ubuntu does not log in after I reset my password I lost my Ubuntu password for my laptop (samsung np nf310).

If you want to share the folder with read and write permissions for everyone, set permissions to 777, e.g\nchmod 777 shared_folder\n\nIf you authenticate remote users, and they belong to same group, you should set the permissions to\nchmod 770 shared_folder\n\nAnd if the folder owner is the only user using shared folder (and you have authentication set up), then\nchmod 700 shared_folder\n\nis the proper choice.\n\nA: I believe your folder permissions have to have eXecute permissions.\nTry making it either 755 or 775.\n\nA: The \"force create mode\" and \"force directory mode\" parameters force Samba to create new files and folders with the set permissions.\nAnd you have to make sure that these folders are owned by the correct user.\nOnce you have created these folders they might already have the wrong permissions.\nHere is the official samba doc.\nhttps://wiki.samba.org/index.php/Setting_up_Samba_as_a_Standalone_Server\n", "Q: How to find which graphic card is there on my laptop?

My wife and I are sharing a laptop running Ubuntu 12.04 LTS and I would like to encrypt the Home folder of each of us while still maintaining access by the other.\nThe encryption part using eCryptfs is simple enough but adding a second user is apparently not well documented. A shared encrypted folder would be possible but I think sharing the whole Home folder would be simpler and better supported by the community at large. \nI read hints that you could add keys to the ecryptfs kernel keyring but the directions I found are far from being clear even if I describe myself as a power user.\n\nA: I thought this would be similar to LUKS with pam_mount using one home partition for all users (I don't know if that can be done or would be a good idea using LUKS) or using separate partitions for each user, which in case of LUKS would be more cumbersome. Reading the FAQ having both users being logged in sould be sufficient, or so it seems:\n\nOnce one user can access an eCryptfs file, any users with permission\n  can also access the file. Should not eCryptfs require all users to\n  have the key in order to access the files?\neCryptfs deliberately makes no attempt to re-implement the\n  discretionary and mandatory access control mechanisms already present\n  in the Linux kernel. eCryptfs will simply require that a File\n  Encryption Key (FEK) be associated with any given inode in order to\n  decrypt the contents of the file on disk. This prevents an attacker\n  from accessing the file contents outside the context of the trusted\n  host environment; for instance, by removing the storage device or by\n  booting a live CD. This is the only type of unauthorized access that\n  eCryptfs is intended to prevent.\nOnce eCryptfs has associated that FEK with the inode, it does not\n  impose any additional restrictions on who or what can access the\n  files, deferring to the standard user/group/other permissions,\n  capabilities, SE Linux type enforcement, and so forth to regulate\n  access to the files. eCryptfs maintains no pedigree regarding how the\n  FEK found its way to the inode, so it has no way of knowing that any\n  particular UID should or should not be able to open the file, nor\n  should eCryptfs do such a thing.\nHaving eCryptfs impose additional access control onto the decrypted\n  file contents in a trusted host environment would provide no\n  additional security while introducing unintended usability issues. For\n  instance, a user may wish to share his decrypted files with certain\n  other users on the system without having to share his key with them or\n  add their keys to a set of keys wrapping the inode's FEK. Users expect\n  to be able to accomplish such a task via users, groups, capabilities,\n  and types, and eCryptfs defers access control decisions on trusted\n  host environments to these existing access control mechanisms.\n\nYou can find the complete FAQ in /usr/share/doc/ecryptfs-utils/ecryptfs-faq.html or online.\n\nAnother workaround would be to use an eCrypfs folder outside the users home folders that can be shared and that has a single password that the users can share (working around that both users would have to log into their accounts).\n\nA: You can accomplish this pretty easily using Samba. It should take about five or ten minutes to get configured. However, please note that both users would need to be logged in for their encryption keys to be available for Samba to use. This won't work in a situation where you want one user to be able to access the other user's files while they are not logged in.\n\n\n*\n\n*Install Samba (if you don't have it installed)\nsudo apt-get install samba\n\n*Add Samba users for the two Linux users (for this example they will be tom and sally)\nsudo smbpasswd -a tom\nsudo smbpasswd -a sally\n\n*Open the Samba config file in a text editor /etc/samba/smb.conf\nsudo nano /etc/samba/smb.conf\n\n*Add your share definitions near the bottom of the file. (Don't use the [home] share definition in the file already, as it won't allow you to use the necessary \"force user\" setting. See the note below about why \"force user\" is needed.)\n[tom]\ncomment = Tom's home folder\npath = /home/tom\nguest ok = no\nbrowseable = yes\nread only = no\nvalid users = tom, sally\nforce user = tom\n[sally]\ncomment = Sally's home folder\npath = /home/sally\nguest ok = no\nbrowseable = yes\nread only = no\nvalid users = tom, sally\nforce user = sally\n\n*Save your changes, then restart the Samba server to be sure your new settings get applied. I use these three commands, but it might be more than is necessary.\nsudo samba restart\nsudo service smbd restart\nsudo service nmbd restart\n\n*(Optional) By default, Samba will advertise your shared folders on the network. You can prevent this in a number of different ways. In the smb.conf file you edited above, you could set the allowed interfaces to only allow 127.0.0.1 (which means \"this computer\"). This can be set globally (in the Networking section of smb.conf) or you can set it individually on each share you want to restrict.\ninterfaces = 127.0.0.1\nIf everything worked properly, you should be able to see your home folders listed in the Network section in your file browser (either your computer will show up as a network device, or you will find the folders in the \"Windows Network\" folder). When you first connect to the shared folder, you will be prompted to enter your Samba username and password, but you can avoid this in the future by having the file browser remember these for you.\nNote: \"Force user\" causes file operations to be executed as the specified Linux user, regardless of who the logged in Samba user is. This means that when Sally writes a file to Tom's shared home, she is actually writing it as the Linux user tom. If you didn't use \"force user\", Sally would get an \"NT_STATUS_ACCESS_DENIED\" error (since Sally's Linux user cannot access Tom's encrypted home).\n", "Q: Where are panel applet information stored in mate?

In this situation, I have two questions?\n\n\n*\n\n*I have 4 drives on my desktop, two of which are SSD's with TRIM supported. However the two have different block limits. I am trying to understand the difference in this:\nModel Number:       Samsung SSD 840 PRO Series              \n   *    Data Set Management TRIM supported (limit 8 blocks)\n\nModel Number:       SanDisk SDSSDX120GG25                   \n   *    Data Set Management TRIM supported (limit 1 block)\n\nSo, what is the difference between limit 8 blocks and limit 1 block? Which would be better?\n\n*I've read articles/tips on enabling trip for previous versions of Ubuntu, how can check to see if I currently have TRIM enabled?\nThank you for your time.\n\nA: *\n\n*The N in \"limit N blocks\" is the maximum number of 512-byte blocks of LBA Range Entries your SSD can handle in a single DATA SET MANAGEMENT command. So we could say that a higher N is better, but according to wikipedia:\n\nTypically this defaults to 8 (or 4 kB) but many drives reduce this to one to meet the Microsoft Windows Hardware Requirements for Trim, Command completion time shall not exceed 20 ms or 8 ms * (number of LBA range entries), whichever is greater, and shall always be less than 600 ms.\n\nSo for me it is not obvious that every drive wants to comply with Microsoft's requirement. If we assume that both of your SSD's comply with those requirements we can say that your Samsung SSD is better in this subject, since it can TRIM more blocks in the same time than your Sandisk one. \nYour Samsung SSD can TRIM a maximum of 16GB of data in a single TRIM command, your Sandisk SSD can only TRIM a maximum of 2 GB of data in a single TRIM command. (That maximum is only reachable if the LBAs to TRIM are contiguous.) But as I said before, we don't know that how fast each of these SSD's deal with that single TRIM command, if they need the same time, then obviously Samsung is better, if the Sandisk finishes much faster with that single command, it may be able to run more TRIM commands in the same time the Samsung runs only one TRIM command.\nAnyway, I think that this parameter has no importance for a consumer. This is more like just a technical characteristic of the drive.\n\n*If you mount your SSD with the discard flag, or if you use fstrim (maybe in a cron job) then you have TRIM enabled. There is nothing more to do to enable it.\n", "Q: Mobile-Broadband stick sometimes not detected at all My mobile-broadband USB stick (lsusb: 12d1:1001 Huawei Technologies Co., Ltd.

Some Huawei dongles simply switches off when you put your laptop into sleep mode.\nHere I'm explaining common workarounds you have.\nAfter waking up from sleep, you have to usually remove and plug the 3G dongle back.\nIn most cases the dongle is re-detected automatically. If not you have to try following commands in your Terminal:\nRestart the modem manager:\n\nsudo restart modemmanager\n\nWait few seconds, until the dongle is prepared, and flip it into modem mode:\n\nsudo eject sr1   \n\n(If you don't have an optical disc drive, change sr1 to sr0)\n\nYou can clearly identify whether the dongle is detected or not by reading the Linux kernel ring buffer. Execute this command in Terminal and plug in your dongle:\n\nwatch 'dmesg | tail -f'\n\nA sample output:\n\nIn the above image my Huawei dongle has been successfully detected.\nYou have to check whether your dongle gets detected like this after waking up from sleep.\n\nIt is known that some Huawei hardware doen't work properly without the proprietary driver.\nYou can install Huawei Mobile Partner software (which includes the driver) and try to establish Internet through it:\n\nThere is a higher chance that you can find the Huawei Mobile Partner available inside your dongle.\nIf you don't have the driver with you, heres how to download and install it:\nInstalling Huawei Mobile Partner 22\n\n\n*\n\n*If you don't have Internet to the host machine, first click here & download the Huawei Mobile Partner 22 to your Home directory. Then execute the below command in Terminal:\ntar -xvzf megafone.tar.gz; cd mp22-linux-64; chmod +x install; sudo ./install\n\n*If you already have Internet to your machine copy the below command into the Terminal at once and execute it:\nwget -O mp22-linux-64.tar.gz https://db.tt/XtrP9KPw; tar -xvzf mp22-linux-64.tar.gz; cd mp22-linux-64; chmod +x install; sudo ./install\nIf your dongle is not detected by 22nd version of mobile partner, you may try installing 21 or 23. \nAlternatively, you can use Sakis3G to connect your dongle to the Internet.\n\nA: *\n\n*Plug-out USB-stick (if stick plugged-in)\n\n*Run sudo service network-manager stop and wait to stop (network-applet will be gone)\n\n*Plug-In USB-stick\n\n*Wait 20-30 seconds\n\n*Run sudo service network-manager start (network-applet will be back)\n\n*Now mobile-broadband will be detect at network-applet (with stable detection) within 20-30 seconds.

I was wondering if it was possible to have a directory linked direct to my websites server (via ftp) rather than using a ftp client and uploading/downloading through that. (Pretty much exactly how the dropbox desktop app works)\nThanks\n\nA: You can use the \"connect to server\" option in nautilus, the file manager of Ubuntu (at least in the standard Unity and Gnome versions). It is called \"Files\": (the screenshot is from a Gnome version of Ubuntu):\n\nLaunch it and choose connect to server. You will have a dialog, enter the ftp direction in the form:\n ftp://ftp.server.com/\n\nSubstitute the name or IP of your server, be careful of the syntax (you have to start with ftp:// with the two forward slashes). In the example I am using a public ftp server for the TeX repository:\n\nClick connect and you will be asked for the credential (in my case I choose anonymous, you probably will need to give user and password): \n\nYou can choose to give the credential for just this session or forever, you choose here. \nEt voilà, you can use your \"share\"  as if it where a local folder. \n\nYou can disconnect to the server by using the small triangle on the side of the name.\nTo reach the volume with a shell, you normally search under /run/user/$UID/gvfs  ($UID is your User Identification Number, you can see it in the shell with echo $UID). \nNote that read-only ftp shares can behave strangely when doing complex operations (for example, trying to create a file I had an Input/output error instead of a permission denied. \n", "Q: How Do I change the size of a Window that a Custom .Desktop Launcher Defaults to? I've created a custom Chrome application shortcut for a webapp that I need to use. Is there a way to control its size (height/width) and/or placement.

The answers are usually somewhere in there (I can't check myself, I repeat : I don't use Chrome).\n\nThe usual command should be the X standard --geometry=wxh+x+y but it wasn't implemented in 2012 yet. Worth the try today though.\nPlacement in X standards are : \n+0+0 : upper left hand corner.\n−0+0 : upper right hand corner.\n−0−0 : lower right hand corner. \n+0−0 : lower left hand corner.\n\nSo, let's say an app should be 100 pixel by 100 pixel, on the top right corner, the command would be : \napplicationname --geometry=100x100-0-0\n\n\nNOTE : these are options you'll need to add to the Exec= command in the .desktop file, not a specific line. You can test these in your terminal direclty. \n", "Q: Purging nginx didnt delete the configuration files I just ran\nsudo apt-get purge nginx\nsudo apt-get autoremove\n\nbut the folder /etc/nginx/still exists, with all its content intact.\nI guess I could rm the folder but that is not the point of my question.

I recently bought a new laptop computer and have been unable to install Ubuntu alongside the Windows 8 operating system.

I don't really need Windows so I just want to wipe the disk and do a clean install of Ubuntu. What I want to know is if this is easy - as it used to be - or is it just as complicated as installing Ubuntu alongside Windows 8. Thanks for your replies. \n\nA: As far as you do not want to dual boot it should be a piece of cake. When you will boot from live usb/cd just follow basic installation steps and when it will come to \"Installation type\" you should choose \"Replace Windows with Ubuntu\" option rather then \"Install alongside\" one.

I have tried MultiSystem and yumi. MultiSystem does weird things with some of the isos, and makes a mess out of GRUB.

You didn't because Grub2 is in the drive MBR and there are no /EFI/Ubuntu files on the EFI partition.\nThere is no sign of your linux boot files. They are supposed to be on /dev/sda6 according to the grub.cfg that is there.\nThere are in fact some Wubi remnants as well, but these do nothing other than confuse Boot repair. Boot repair is in fact flailing about because it's trying to \"repair\" what looks like your Ubuntu USB, fscking it and reinstalling the drive MBR.\nDid you change your boot options? It should be booting in EFI mode, not BIOS mode. That photo shows that it's not detecting anything bootable on your drive. Which might explain why Windows won't boot either. So I'd recommend trying to fix that first. Once Windows is booting again, clean up those Ubuntu partitions and try to reinstall Ubuntu, this time in EFI mode.

Occasionally when my laptop dies, it shuts down, but then will boot up without actually starting windows again.  It shows the boot screen, but has my programs already open, and does not take a long time to load.  Last time this happened, I booted up Ubuntu instead of windows, and when I needed to switch back to use windows, it retained the much faster start up speed.  It has the programs open that were there when it ran out of battery.  \nI have linux on a ssd, but due to windows coming on my laptop, it remains on my hdd.  The boot time for windows is ridiculous, and I was hoping this would allow me to switch between the two more freely.  If it helps I use a Lenovo y580.\nSo is there a way to pause windows 8, keeping programs open, then use Ubuntu as my os, and then reboot back up windows keeping the programs and faster start time?  Or is that just my laptop doing it?\n\nA: Maybe hibernation is state you can use. In hibernation mode all OS copies all RAM contents to HDD and totally power off itself. But on boot it copies all contents back to RAM and that process is not so fast (in case you have slow HDD and alot of RAM). You can read more here\n", "Q: What is xdiagnose?

Essentially when I originally installed ubuntu, I got rid of my windows and had the hard drive reformatted.  I never split up the hard drive to dual boot.  Now that the hard drive is formatted for linux...how to I get some space available to be able to dual boot?  It won't let me partition when I'm using the hard drive that is associated with the operating system.  Please help.\n\nA: Using a Virtual Machine, for example with VirtualBox, and installing Windows on it it's a good and safe alternative; if your CPU supports VT-x it should run almost fast as a real machine.\nBut this way you will always have to start Ubuntu before start Windows, this generally it's ok, but depends on your needings. \nSo if you don't want to use virtualization, you should download a \"Parted Magic\" ISO image, burn on a CD, and boot from this : the GParted software included will let you resize and create partitions. \n\nA: You have 2 possibilities:\n\n\n*\n\n*GParted is used to change the Linux partitioning (decreasing the size of ). You need some space on one of the Linux partitions. \n\n*Use Oracle Virtual Box on Linux (or similar software) and install Windows into a virtual machine.\n\n\nMethod 1 is more risky. You boot from your Windows cd and install Windows on the newly created partition. Windows does not care of other oses and I don't remember if Windows\nwill not screw up the Linux boot loader... If you can avoid Windows to touch the Linux boot loader configuration (grub) then you can later add the Windows os from Linux...\n", "Q: Configuration changes resist to apply, and some other mess; need help!

There seems to be a bug with the current TeamViewer implementation on Linux where it shows a Windows-looking \"balloon\" type notification informing the user that TeamViewer is still running in the background. To disable this notification, the user is encouraged to click the notification, but this does not work.\nAs clicking the notification does not work, how do you make TeamViewer no longer display the message, seemingly triggered by full screen applications?\n\nA: According to this forum thread on Linux Mint Forums, there is a value called ShowTaskbarInfoOnMinimize that TeamViewer stores in the Windows registry. However, the TeamViewer implementation in Linux does not use Wine's registry, so the modification needs to be done to the following file (as per the comment below, shut down TeamViewer before editing this file):\n~/.config/teamviewer9/config/client.conf\nAdd the following line to the end of the file:\n[int32] ShowTaskbarInfoOnMinimize = 0\n...and start TeamViewer back up.\nThe notification should no longer appear.\nedit: If this solution does not work for you, please open up the file again and verify that the value is actually set to zero. For me, it actually reset back to 1 and had to be corrected and saved, and the next time TeamViewer started up it worked.

Is there a media player that can be taught to not play certain tracks, either using ID3 tags or a blacklist?  I looked at Rhythmbox, Banshee and Quod Libet but so far didn't discover a  built-in feature or extension like that.\n\nA: You can use gmusicbrowser for that. It includes powerful filtering options which allow you to add filters (or intelligent playlists, as other players call it) such as \"Comment does not include '[SKIP]'\", \"Rating >= 50%\" or \"Rating set to default\".\nWhen creating your filter rule, be aware that comments are saved in the file metadata while ratings are saved in gmusicbrowser's settings file ;)\n", "Q: Repeater/Access Point with 2 WiFi interfaces very low bandwidth if somebody knows an answer to Access Point question!\nI set up an AP with Hostapd.
