["Q: LightDM isn't displaying backdrop I installed the ATI catalyst driver a couple days ago and since then I haven't been able to see anything other than a boring purple screen when I try to log in. The boot splash has also been affected.\nWhat should I do to get things back to normal?\n\nA: I have had seemingly similar issues with Nvidia. Overscan, screen resolution issue, pushes menus beyond screen border.\nDid you try loading the terminal app using keyboard shortcut once os loads?   Try :~$   Ctr-Alt-T\nIf you see terminal screen show up then attempt running catalyst control centre by typing in terminal :~$  sudo amdcccle \nOne issue i currently have myself is that once resolution manually changed ( Nvidia chipset), after restart, xorg doesn't appear to be reading from the xorg.conf file. A manual change is required each time.\n", "Q: No boot option after Ubuntu install I just installed Ubuntu on my Windows Vista laptop using the Windows Installer.

I'm a beginner with Ubuntu, booting it via usb in order to see if I can recover files from my hard drive after a crash.  I clicked on my hard drive in order to mount it, and got \"Unable to mount 151 GB Filesystem\" as the title of an error message.  It then goes on to say:\nError mounting: mount exited with exit code 13: ntfs_attr_pread_i: ntfs_pread\nfailed: Input/output error\nFailed to read NTFS $Bitmap: Input/output error\nNTFS is either inconsistent, or there is a hardware fault, or it's a SoftRAID/FakeRAID hardware.  In the first case run chkdsk /f on Windows then reboot into Windows twice.  The usage of the /f parameter is very important!  If the device is a SoftRAID/FakeRAID then first activate it and mount a different device under the /dev/mapper/ directory (e.g. /dev/mapper/nvidia_eahaabcc1).  Please see the 'dmraid' documentation for more details.*\nDoes this indicate a total hard drive failure, or is there a way to correct this error and access my files?\nTnx\nJW\n\nA: You can try and install ``ntfsprogs\".\n$ sudo apt-get install ntfsprogs\n\nThen, try and run \"ntfsck\" and/or \"ntfsfix\" on the Windows NTFS partition.\n$ ntfsck /dev/sda1    #If your partition is /dev/sda1\n\nIf you're not sure of the Windows partition/device, you can try ``fdisk\" command on the Terminal.\n$ sudo fdisk -l\n\nLook for the \"Device\" with \"System\" as NTFS.

The two-channel auto-type obfuscation feature of KeePass doesn't work for me with Chromium (on Ubuntu 12.04 64 bits). However, it works just fine with Firefox.\nDows anyone know how to fix this?\nTextboxes in web forms in Chromium seems to have something special that causes this feature to fail. Only some of the username/password characters are being auto-typed.\nThis might be related to this: if I select an entry in KeePass and click \"Copy User Name\", I can paste it fine with Ctrl+V in any textbox in Firefox, but I can't on Chromium. However, text copied using Ctrl+C from a regular text file (say, from gedit), can be pasted fine on both browsers.\nWhat may be wrong?\nI wouldn't like to deactive this feature for all the entries in my keepass files as I use them on Windows too and they work just fine there (even on Google Chrome for Windows). This feature gives an appreciated extra security measure against spyware/keyloggers.\n\nA: You must add {DELAY=50} at first of keystroke sequence and it will slow down typing rate of all text. This will make typing in Google Chrome or Chromium is correct.\nI hope this can help you.\n\nA: The keepass forum on sourceforge says this has been \"fixed in Chrome 19\" (still in beta?). \nI think it's issue 32056.  I'm downloading an update now to see whether it fixes this problem.\n\nLater: I'm not finding any version 19 of either Chromium or Chrome. I'm off down the rabbit hole to try to track down a binary.\nThe current beta for Google Chrome is \"Version 21.0.1180.15 beta\". This keepass issue is fixed in this version of Chrome. The Chromium beta download (64-bit Debian/Ubuntu) is the same file (same md5 sum).\n", "Q: Successfully installed SASS, but the terminal insists it isn't I wanted to install sass version 3.2.0 alpha.  \nI first ran sudo apt-get install libhaml-ruby1.8, which is what the console recommended  It successfully installed, but it installed an older version of sass.\nJust in case, I tried installing it via rubygems: \nsudo apt-get install rubygems1.8\nsudo gem install sass\n\nThis just reinstalled sass 3.1.17.

So your browser window would move while you adjusted volume. (A program can listen for right click pressed and then listen for scroll wheel. If right click released occurs, it stops listening for scroll wheel and resumes listening for right click pressed. I don't know if any such program exists.)\nI don't think either of those do quite what you want.\n\nA: Check out this xbindkey tool : https://github.com/mrtgenet/xbindkeys-guile-mouse-altkeys-and-more\nYou may find some information, notably binding many buttons using guile configuration.

So, I dug it deeper and found a similar thread here My headphones mute AlsaMixer when I plug them in, HP DV6 12.04\nIn my case, I had the problem that plugging headphones in would switch the speaker sound to zero as well as mute it (which is correct and should definitely happen); and when you disconnect the headphones, the headphones would be muted.

I could not imagine that even today \"DIE HARD 4\" is going live somewhere. Well the only problem you are having seems to be the grub loader issue. Just put in the window repair disk and open up the command prompt.

If you can boot with ubuntu go ahead on the left u will see a shortcut panel. from top click the second icon to access your docs. From there u will see all existing media folders and try recover. This is possible as long the win partition exists. \n\nA: Well, that happens, but is not the end. Just boot to Ubuntu, Click Home Folder from the Launcher Bar at the left and then click Filesystem from the left side panel and then look the media file, you should be able to see any partition that is on the same HDD, just click on it to mount it and you should able to see the contents of it as normal, even if is a windows OS partition. Then you can backup or have access to your data. \nOther thing you can do is use the Windows Repair Disk to fix your windows boot entry that is not showing in Grub anymore, if that the case. Just google it, is free.\nHope this helps :)\n", "Q: Corrupted file Ubuntu OS download (11.10 & 12.4) Two time I tried to download Ubuntu 11.10 version and 12.04 version. but both files are corrupted, unable to install. When I install Ubuntu 11.10, after 5 minutes it shows file missing, unable to install.

What should I do?\nMy PC configration:\nProcessor: AMD Athlon 64 X2 2.913 Ghz\n500GB HDD Hitachi\nNVIDIA chipset\nLast time I downloaded Ubuntu 11.04, it was installed properly and worked properly but know I face big problem. Now I fed-up. Please Help me, what should I do?\n\nA: How did you download the files. Is it normal http/ftp or Torrent download. Http and ftp downloads are too much  prone to file corruption. I would suggest you to download the files using Torrent protocol, which has in-build feature to check the correctness of the download. If you have downloaded the file using Torrent then also check the ISO MD5 checksum with the Ubuntu website MD5 checksum. If both are same then there is no problem with the ISO file.\nSecondly, are you using a CD or Pendrive to install the Ubuntu? In case of CD, I have seen such issues if the CD has scratched. Try the pendrive install. \n\nA: Personally I download from a bittorrent client and FORCE a recheck once it's complete to make sure the iso image is ok, then I burn at the slowest speed possible onto a good quality DVD using Brasero or ImgBurn for Windows and both tend to work fine...\n\nA: The second message definitely comes from an incompatible architecture. Your CPU is a 32bit architecture CPU (since you don't have the Athlon 64 X2). This is why you only can install the 32bit Ubuntu. You have downloaded the 64bit version resulting in that message. It is possible to install a 32bit Ubuntu on a 64bit machine but not the other way around. Try again with 32bit.\nI have no idea where the first message comes from though.\n", "Q: Why did I have to remove resolvconf to get dnsmasq to work again? Yesterday I upgraded to Precise and dnsmasq stopped working. That is, DNS queries to localhost where dnsmasq is listening (127.0.0.1) were refused. \nRemoving resolvconf (apt-get remove resolvconf) and rebooting solved the issue (found that suggestion somewhere on Google). /etc/resolv.conf looked fine with and without resolvconf in place. No difference at all.\n\n\n*\n\n*Why would I use resolvconf? Are there any benefits?  The Wikipedia article covering resolvconf sucks. \n\n*Why did resolvconf interfere with dnsmasq?  Is this a known issue?\n\n\nA: I've just removed it on my install. I was using pppd manually to dial my 3G modem connection and resolvconf interfered with my dns settings by automatically adding my provider DNS when I wanted to use custom DNS. pppd has options to control this but resolvconf clobbered them with its own settings. I would also like to know answer to this question? It seems like this is some make-it-easier-but-instead-complicate-things kind of package?\np.s. I've found this bug report:\nhttps://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/resolvconf/+bug/922578\n\nA: The simple answer to (1) is: resolvconf sets itself up as the intermediary between programs that supply this information (such as ifup and ifdown, DHCP clients, the PPP daemon and local name servers) and programs that use this information (such as DNS caches and resolver libraries). As of Ubuntu 12.04 resolvconf is part of the default installation in both the server and desktop variants. It is never necessary to remove resolvconf and people who do remove it usually don't understand it, generally because they haven't read resolvconf(8) and /usr/share/doc/resolvconf/README.gz.\nThe answer to the second question is that resolvconf most probably did not interfere with dnsmasq. My guess is that you were running into bug #959037.\nExplanation: In Ubuntu 12.04 there are two ways in which dnsmasq gets run. There is the traditional standalone version of dnsmasq which listens on all addresses. And there is the new NetworkManager-controlled dnsmasq process which listens only on 127.0.0.1. The latter conflicts with the former unless the former is reconfigured. This problem was solved in Ubuntu 12.10 by having the NM-controlled dnsmasq process listen on 127.0.1.1 instead of 127.0.0.1 and by forcing the standalone dnsmasq process to listen only on addresses assigned to interfaces.\n\nA: The simple answer to (1) is: resolvconf sets itself up as the intermediary\n between programs that supply this information (such as ifup and\n ifdown, DHCP clients, the PPP daemon and local name servers) and\n programs that use this information (such as DNS caches and resolver\n libraries).\nThat's from the package description. On desktops, it works in conjunction with NetworkManager to handle making and dropping connections smoothly.\nSo resolvconf, along with dnsmasq, are used in 12.04 to make the DNS info handling more reliable on the desktop version. So in some situations, it does make things better, but the whole situation lacks the documentation in the right place, esp. in the server world.\nDespite loads of Googling, I haven't been able to ascertain what is recommended on a server installation.\nAs far as (2) goes, you're having the opposite problem from me. Dnsmasq works well with resolvconf on my machine and updates the /etc/resolv.conf file to contain 127.0.0.1 but has other problems because dnsmasq doesn't get the ISP name servers from dhclient on eth0 (this is a gateway) nor does it get the name servers I manually entered in the eth0 stanza in /etc/network/interfaces. \nWhy do you use dnsmasq? Are you also running a gateway with 2 nics? Or is it just a plain desktop? If so, resolvconf co-ordinates with network-manager  \n", "Q: BT Mouse disconnects after upgrade to 12.04 After upgrade to KUbuntu 12.04 my BT Mouse disconnects after some time not using it.

I have scoured the web, and I can't seem to get Xmodmap / anything to work properly. I want to swap BOTH my Command keys with my Control key - in essence, inverting what they do currently.\nHow would I do that?\nI tried xmodmap -e \"keycode 133 = Control_L\" and corresponding commands for keycodes 134 (right command) and 37 (control left).

For some reason, by default, Ubuntu thinks that the MacBook Pro has a standard 105 key keyboard (probably thinking about the full Apple Keyboard) but that is wrong.

Tweak tool had all the necessary settings in an easy to use GUI!\nsudo apt install gnome-tweak-tool\n\nFirst I swapped the dashboard hotkey to the right side and then under \"Additional Layout Options\" you can use \"Ctrl position/ Swap Left Win with Left Ctrl\" to good effect.\n\nA: Duplicate of How to swap Command and Control keys with xkb step by step?\nIn 16.04, here's the way I finally got this  to work.\nXmodmap doesn't work universally in all apps, gnome tweak tool lacked the function, dconf editing a custom altwin2 key swap (like the main answer here) failed, so I was tearing my hair out until I combined several answers into this complete, simple, and elegant solution:\ngksudo gedit /usr/share/X11/xkb/symbols/pc\n\nchange it to:\ndefault  partial alphanumeric_keys modifier_keys\nxkb_symbols \"pc105\" {\n\nkey <ESC>  {    [ Escape        ]   };\n\n// The extra key on many European keyboards:\nkey <LSGT> {    [ less, greater, bar, brokenbar ] };\n\n// The following keys are common to all layouts.\nkey <BKSL> {    [ backslash,    bar ]   };\nkey <SPCE> {    [    space      ]   };\n\ninclude \"srvr_ctrl(fkey2vt)\"\ninclude \"pc(editing)\"\ninclude \"keypad(x11)\"\n\nkey <BKSP> {    [ BackSpace, BackSpace  ]   };\n\nkey  <TAB> {    [ Tab,  ISO_Left_Tab    ]   };\nkey <RTRN> {    [ Return        ]   };\n\nkey <CAPS> {    [ Caps_Lock     ]   };\nkey <NMLK> {    [ Num_Lock      ]   };\n\nkey <LFSH> {    [ Shift_L       ]   };\nkey <LCTL> {    [ Alt_L     ]   };\nkey <LWIN> {    [ Super_L       ]   };\n\nkey <RTSH> {    [ Shift_R       ]   };\nkey <RCTL> {    [ Alt_R     ]   };\nkey <RWIN> {    [ Super_R       ]   };\nkey <MENU> {    [ Menu          ]   };\n\n// Beginning of modifier mappings.\nmodifier_map Shift  { Shift_L, Shift_R };\nmodifier_map Lock   { Caps_Lock };\nmodifier_map Control{ Control_L, Control_R };\nmodifier_map Mod2   { Num_Lock };\nmodifier_map Mod4   { Super_L, Super_R };\n\n// Fake keys for virtual<->real modifiers mapping:\nkey <LVL3> {    [ ISO_Level3_Shift  ]   };\nkey <MDSW> {    [ Mode_switch       ]   };\nmodifier_map Mod5   { <LVL3>, <MDSW> };\n\nkey <ALT>  {    [ NoSymbol, Control_L, Control_R    ]   };\n//include \"altwin(meta_alt)\"\nkey <LALT> {    [ Control_L     ]   };\nkey <RALT> {    [ Control_R     ]   };\nmodifier_map Mod1   { Alt_L, Alt_R, Meta_L, Meta_R };\n\nkey <META> {    [ NoSymbol, Meta_L, Meta_R  ]   };\nmodifier_map Mod1   { <META> };\n\nkey <SUPR> {    [ NoSymbol, Super_L ]   };\nmodifier_map Mod4   { <SUPR> };\n\nkey <HYPR> {    [ NoSymbol, Hyper_L ]   };\nmodifier_map Mod4   { <HYPR> };\n// End of modifier mappings.\n\nkey <OUTP> { [ XF86Display ] };\nkey <KITG> { [ XF86KbdLightOnOff ] };\nkey <KIDN> { [ XF86KbdBrightnessDown ] };\nkey <KIUP> { [ XF86KbdBrightnessUp ] };\n};\n\nhidden partial alphanumeric_keys\nxkb_symbols \"editing\" {\nkey <PRSC> {\ntype= \"PC_ALT_LEVEL2\",\nsymbols[Group1]= [ Print, Sys_Req ]\n};\nkey <SCLK> {    [  Scroll_Lock      ]   };\nkey <PAUS> {\ntype= \"PC_CONTROL_LEVEL2\",\nsymbols[Group1]= [ Pause, Break ]\n};\nkey  <INS> {    [  Insert       ]   };\nkey <HOME> {    [  Home         ]   };\nkey <PGUP> {    [  Prior        ]   };\nkey <DELE> {    [  Delete       ]   };\nkey  <END> {    [  End          ]   };\nkey <PGDN> {    [  Next         ]   };\n\nkey   <UP> {    [  Up           ]   };\nkey <LEFT> {    [  Left         ]   };\nkey <DOWN> {    [  Down         ]   };\nkey <RGHT> {    [  Right        ]   };\n};\n\nSave.\nrm -rf /var/lib/xkb/*\n\n(I don't know if this is required, but I did it.)\nReboot.\n\nA: Another solution which does NOT involve Xmodmap, nor depends on gnome-tweaks is to instruct the module to swap them. It already has the functionality.\nTo play around with the parameters you can change them live. First check the existing parameters with modinfo hid_apple and then modify them on the fly:\necho 2 >> /sys/module/hid_apple/parameters/fnmode\necho 1 >> /sys/module/hid_apple/parameters/swap_opt_cmd\necho 1 >> /sys/module/hid_apple/parameters/swap_fn_leftctrl\n\nOnce you are comfortable with the configuration, you can make them permanent.\nCreate a file like this /etc/modprobe.d/hid_apple.conf and add your parameters like this:\noptions hid_apple fnmode=2 swap_opt_cmd=1\n\nThen remember to call update-initramfs -k -all (or dracut --regenerate-all --force in Fedora) so the parameters get loaded when the module gets loaded on boot, or they will be ignored.\nThis option is specially good because the command key can be used as AltGr, which helps you type special characters like áéíóúñ, which is not possible with the alternative fixes.\n", "Q: xorg.conf and Unity3D?

If I connect a single monitor to each graphics card, Unity3D will not work, it drops down to Unity2D.  If I connect 3 monitors, i.e. 2 monitors on card 1 and 1 monitor on card 2, it drops down to Unity2D.  If I connect 2 monitors each to each card, it again drops down to Unity2D.\nSo it seems that Unity3D only works with a single graphics card...\nHow can this be fixed?\n\nA: When experimenting with multiple monitors while Unity 3d I found out that the maximum width of the virtual desktop the monitors display pieces of cannot exceed 2048. I think the top to bottom maximum is also 2048. I assume that it has to do with the compositing done with compiz. To display my two monitors I had to place one after another.\nIf you want Unity 3D would it perhaps be suitable (and helpful) to have two displays above and two displays below?\n", "Q: Packet loss with Ubuntu 11.10 I have a machine with Windows 7 and Ubuntu 11.10\nIn Ubuntu I have about 30% packet loss when I make pings either to my router gateway or to an external site such as google.com, so my internet connection goes very slow.\nSince the network works perfectly fine in Windows 7 (without any packet loss), I assume it's not a problem of the line.\nIs there anything I could change in network settings or something similar in order to make this work correctly in Ubuntu?\nI edit to say that I found my solution here (the problem was defective realtek drivers): \nHow do I stop my ethernet network connection from dropping?\n\nA: I have experienced Packet Loss in Ubuntu, too under two circumstances:\n\n\n*\n\n*Routing Issues when having multiple Interfaces in the same Network\nI had two LAN Ports in the same network and the I suppose the routing of both interfaces overlapped and they took turns in sending/receiving from and to the network. The problem stopped as soon as i disabled one interface\n$ sudo ifconfig eth1 down\n\n\n*Connections are timing out because they tried to use IPv6 at times\nEspecially when doing DNS Requests while apt-get updating some repositories, even official ubuntu ones, cannot be resolved to an ip.\nSee https://help.ubuntu.com/community/WebBrowsingSlowIPv6IPv4 in this case.\nAlso you should give more information, like complete output of both\n$ ifconfig\n\nand\n$ route\n\nUnder no circumstances should you need to remove network-manager or any other preinstalled network management software. They work just fine, when configured correctly.\nI'm sorry that both points are rather blurry, but I guarantee, that both happened as I told them.\n\nA: There is a similar problem like you and there a solution to it says:\nI finally managed to download wicd with much pain and patience and I'm happy to report it is much better now. It works good enough to browse the web and post this although it is too early to say it's it is back 100%. The problem must have been with the network manager package.\n\nand here is the link to the problem.\n\nA: I have had earlier versions of Ubuntu fail to get along with older router firmware. Check to see if your router is older and there is newer firmware available.\nYou can find instructions on the internet to update this. You need to type your routers IP address into the URL bar with a web browser (there is a manufacturers default IP address for your model number). If you do not have the username and password than you will need to find the manufacturers default credentials from on the web as well. If you still cannot get in, than reset your router (small push button somewhere) and than try the default login credentials again. There should be a update button/menu in the UI somewhere to automatically update (you may need to download the file for it to update with).\nNOTE: If your router has been configured, any changes to the router will be permanent. You can only go back to the manufactuaers defaults with the reset button. Any of your current deviations from the default settings will be lost!\n", "Q: Wireless not working on Dell XPS 17 after installing 12.04 I (linux newbie) have a Dell XPS 17 and tried to install Ubuntu 12.04.

When I enable it nothing changes, and when I close Gnome Tweak and restart it it is disabled again. If I go to extensions.gnome.org and try to enable it from there the same happens.

How can I install the ubuntu 12.04 without downloading ubuntu-12.04-wubi-amd64.tar.xz?\n\nA: Your best answer is to get the live-DVD.  Please use this to boot and use the 'Try Ubuntu' option to make sure it runs OK on your hardware before attempting to install.  You then have the option of using wubi recommended only if you use Ubuntu only occasionally or installing on a partition.  Either way, make sure you can recover all data and the Windows operating system if something goes wrong.\n\nA: If your network is really slow you might want to order one of the Ubuntu CDs/DVDs. You could also ask someone to download and burn the DVD images for you. There is also a mini-iso that has a \"network installation\" option which tends to download a little bit less. That one still downloads quiet a lot of data and is hard to get by as it is not an official option any more (as far as I know).\n\nA: http://nl.releases.ubuntu.com/12.04/ubuntu-12.04-wubi-amd64.tar.xz\nHey dude Download it from here and save it.

Then, as if that wasn't enough, I send a Problem Report and that crashes too.\nThese crashes are random. Also, and I don't know if this is related, I suffer complete, random system crashes. It can be minutes or, hours, after booting. It just goes blank and I have to press the power button. After I reboot, one or, both, of my 2TB External HDDs cannot be mounted by Ubuntu because they were not unmounted correctly. The actual advice given by Ubuntu is to plug them into a Windows system. I do and they can be read perfectly.\nCan anyone help?\n\nA: Random crashes like this are often the symptom of hardware failure, particularly RAM. I suggest you run the memory test option available to you from the initial bootloader (or from the LiveCD you installed from).\nWhile my current install of Precise has had it's crashes, they've been consistently the same programs. A random distribution of processes, and the crash reporter itself crashing, would not be consistent with a programming error.\nOn the matter of your external drives, they are probably formatted with the NTFS file system ; Linux doesn't really have a satisfactory NTFS filesystem check / fix (fsck) utility, because NTFS is a poorly documented proprietary file system - this is one of those things that are upsetting you about Windows. Linux will politely refuse to mount NTFS volumes that have not been unmounted correctly (as happens in a crash), because it's less than certain about it's ability to fix problems. You can force them to mount manually, but the best solution is probably to mount them in Windows (sigh) and shut it down properly, which should rectify the problem.\nIf you need a file system to exchange files with Windows, FAT32 is probably the best choice, since it does have a functional fsck utility. As an older file system, this involves compromise. It's also possible to mount ext2 in Windows, as long as you install additional file system drivers, but if you want to exchange files with machines you don't have admin privileges on, that isn't an option.\nBut your first concern should really be to diagnose what seems to be a hardware issue.\n", "Q: I can't watch the flash video (e.g. youtube) with a fresh install of Ubuntu 12.04 I'm running Precise Pangolin in my desktop pc; it works globally, but I can't watch any kind of flash video on the web.\nI've installed flashplugin-installer and ubuntu-restricted-extras, like suggests in the answers, but nothing changes.\nMaybe the problem is my Nvidia GeForce3 ???\n\nA: The easiest way to install flash in firefox is to install the restricted extras packages.

After 10mins or so, my screen is locked (which I like).\nI just wanted to know if running processes or the Internet connection will be locked too when that happens. Because I don't want to do that stuff after I get back on my PC again.\nAnd if that's the case (halted processes), Is there a way to keep processes / connection running while the screen is locked?\n\nA: This is because the program terminates as the screen closes(the ubuntu way). You need to mention the services to go on by\nscreen your_program_name\n\nyou can close screen with crtl-a-d then reopen it later with screen -rx\n\nA: My answer to your question is It should not.\nAs far as i have been using Ubuntu i have seen processes stopping only when it is told to do so (I use a rhythmbox plugin which stops playing msic when the screnn gets locked without that plugin the music goes on.). Also i do the same thing that you do i.e lock the screen and keep stuff for syncing, downloading etc but it has never happened that the process gets stopped. \n", "Q: Ubuntu install error I get the following error when installing ubuntu 12.04:\n*Stooping CPU interrupts balancing deamon ..............................

I have searched the web but am probably not wording my question correctly.\n\nA: You just can't link an image from your computer directly in Blogger or any website. Why? Easy: because NOBODY would be able to see the data. Let me explain.\n\n\n*\n\n*~ represent the user's folder. If Blogger would let you add it, the path would change between every device, including the server where the website is hosted! (yep, websites are stored in computers like yours)\n\n*Even if that worked, you wouldn't be able to see the image from another device. That happends because you're not sharing your computer's content to the entire Internet (if your computer does, then it's a server). You would need to set up complicated things like Apache, DNS or port forwarding.\n\n\nSo then, how do you add your photo to the Blogger widget?

If so it is urgent that you back up anything you are missing as you have a system that may be unrescueable.  You mow have only one option and that is to use a DVD or a usb.  You are probably going to have to get someone else to get one for you.

But my VLC player's volume is just too low in 12.04 compared to when I was in 11.10. In 11.10, I would set VLC's Application volume in the Sound Settings to almost its maximum and the Output volume to around 137%. Then I will just adjust the volume of VLC player to my preferences. But here in 12.04, once I adjust the volume on VLC player, it will also adjust VLC's Application volume in the Sound Settings. Did I just encountered a bug in my Sound Settings during 11.10 and was corrected in 12.04 or something really changed? I've tried experimenting with the audio settings of VLC but to no avail. VLC player is my default media player, since I'm pretty familiar with it already. Hope somebody can help me.\n\nA: Questions about VLC might be better put to the VLC team.  VLC package it for Ubuntu, but are responsible for problems on it.\n\nA: Well maybe this could help you. I had the same problem and when i found, only solution that worked for me was to install pavucontrol and correctly setup my soundcard output. Then everything worked fine.

The keyboard shortcut for Workspace switcher indicates that Ctrl+Alt+ arrow keys switches to the desired workspace.\n\nWhile this works for Up/Down arows, using Ctrl+Alt+ Left/Right doesn't seem to work - the switcher doesn't move to the desired workspace. \nAm I doing something wrong here?\n\nA: So as noted in Sathya's comment, he is running under Vmware.\nThe reason this doesn't work is because VMware Player is taking control of Ctrl+Alt, because that's the key combination it uses to \"break out\" of the VM.\nThere are two ways you can fix this:\nOverride\nThere is an escape override built into VMware which overrides the breakout combination, by tapping Space while holding down the breakout combination, before hitting your desired key So for example, if you wanted to go to the right workspace you would hold down Ctrl+Alt, tap Space and then tap Right.\nChange the Combination\nChange the breakout combination. To do this, edit preferences.ini (in Windows 7 it's in C:\\Users\\$YOUR_USERNAME$\\AppData\\Roaming\\VMware, if you can't find it search) and add:\npref.hotkey.shift = \"true\"\npref.hotkey.alt = \"true\"\npref.hotkey.control = \"true\"\n\nThis remaps the breakout combination to Ctrl+Alt+Shift.\nBefore you say anything, yes, I realise that this is also used in Ubuntu, to move windows between workspaces. Unfortunately, that is the best I've been able to come up with so far. You are supposed to be able to be as specific as left or right control, but they don't work for me, leftControl etc just maps back to both.\nReferences:\n\n\n*\n\n*http://communities.vmware.com/message/353101#353101\n\n*http://sanbarrow.com/vmx/vmx-preferences-ini.html\n", "Q: Artheros AR9287 Txpower I'm using Ubuntu 12.04 LTS on my Aspire 3820TG which comes with an Artheros AR9287.

When I checked properties, It said it is not working because cant load drivers. I even browsed to location where those drivers supposed to be, And all corresponding files are there.\nAnyone knows what could have happened?\n\nA: Don't know Windows 7, but in earlier version of Windows, the device manager allows you to remove the ones that are marked with the exclamation mark.  After that, Windows 'finds' the new hardware and offers to re-install the drivers.  Really though this is a Windows problem, not one that is on topic here.\n", "Q: How do I view the keyboard buffer?

I was wondering if anyone knew how to detect if a key is currently pressed with either Gtk or Gdk and python?  I don't want to use the key-pressed or key-released event for this scenario, but rather check if it is currently pressed on application startup.\nSpecifically, here is what I would like my application to do:\n\n\n*\n\n*Begin opening by keyboard shortcut.\n\n*Wait 2 seconds.\n\n*If keyboard shortcut is still held after 2 seconds, show the window.\n\n*If, at any point during the 2 second timer, the keyboard shortcut was released, do not show the window, and exit.\n\n\nThis is similar to the functionality seen in the Unity Keyboard Shortcut Overlay, where you hold the SUPER key for 2 seconds and the window is displayed.  If there is a better way to do this (preferably without the program running in the background and waiting), that would be acceptable as well.\nHoping for the best,\nSean\n\nA: Assuming that you are talking about an ordinary button (as supposed to a togglebutton) you can see  all the methods it has here. As I read it there does not seem to be a function for what you are looking for, probably because these things are designed to be event driven.\nIn any case, I am wondering, can't you just get the events to set a boolean and have a look at that to see if it is pressed. Otherwise, maybe you can explain the rationale of why it is important to you to go around the events.\nEDIT\nAfter realizing that I misread you original post and that you were talking about keyboard keys and not buttons I came up with the following suggestion.\nWhen the program is run, it will make a gtk window and hide it, to make it possible to listen for keyboard events. Then it will listen for key released events from any of the keys that are in the shortcut that started the program (in this case ctrl-alt-u). If any of those keys are released, within the start up timeout, it will quit at the end of the timeout, otherwise, it will show the program.\nIf you want to delay the actual start of your program code to save resources, you can of course just use a dummy window and not load the real window or any of the underlying classes before in the start_or_not function.\nimport pygtk\npygtk.require('2.0')\nimport gtk\n\nclass DelayedStart:\n\n    def __init__(self):\n        self.w = gtk.Window()\n        self.w.connect('destroy', gtk.main_quit)\n        # Connect key released events to a function\n        self.w.connect('key_release_event', self.on_key_press_event)\n        self.w.show_all()\n        # Hide the window, we actually need a gtk window to listen for\n        # keyboard events, so we just hide it\n        self.w.set_decorated(False)\n        self.w.set_opacity(0)\n\n        self.show_on_timeout = True\n        # Ask gtk to call the this function in 2 seconds\n        gtk.timeout_add(1000*2, self.start_or_not)\n        gtk.main()\n\n    def on_key_press_event(self, widget, event):\n        \"\"\" Check if any of the key in the shortcut ctrl-alt-u is released \"\"\"\n        # ctrl = 65507, alt = 65513, u = 117\n        keys = [65507, 65513, 117]\n        if event.keyval in keys:\n            self.show_on_timeout = False\n\n    def start_or_not(self):\n        \"\"\" Check if the program should be started or not \"\"\"\n        if self.show_on_timeout:\n            self.w.set_decorated(True)\n            self.w.set_opacity(1)\n        else:\n            gtk.main_quit()\n        # Returning false will destroy the timer, we only want to run this once\n        return False\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    DELAYED_START = DelayedStart()\n\n\nA: I'll just add a note here; I just learned of the keybinder library, which apparently is split from Tomboy notes (though it is Gtk2, and I just saw the label Gtk3): \n\n\n*\n\n*http://kaizer.se/wiki/keybinder/\nIt is compiled from C as a shared object library .so, and it has a Python interface:\npython -c 'import pprint,inspect,keybinder; pprint.pprint(inspect.getmembers(keybinder))' | less\n\nLook at the source in keybinder/libkeybinder at master · engla/keybinder · GitHub; I can see that even on a C level, the implementation is through signing up for keypress events - and there is nothing (apparent to me) holding the actual pressed state of keyboard keys. Which probably means that, unfortunately, there isn't a facility (function, array) to look up a pressed state of a(ny) key at any time. \n", "Q: Redshift indicator usage I use this command when starting the computer: \ngtk-redshift-l 36.47: -6.20 6400:4400-g 0.8-m-v vidmode \nThe first question is whether I've used this command correctly, and the second is whether the program needs to be running both at night and during the day.

I have seen many softwares such as Update Manager and Synaptic Package Manager, they wait if some other program is using the /var/lib/dpkg/lock and is locked. How can we do this through the Terminal? I saw apt-get's manual but didn't find anything useful.\n\nA: Since 1.9.11 apt and apt-get have an option that lets you wait for the dpkg locks to be released.\nUse the DPkg::Lock::Timeout option to set a timeout, in seconds, for an apt-get command. This example will wait for 60 seconds:\nsudo apt-get -o DPkg::Lock::Timeout=60 install packagename\n\nIf you set that value to -1, it will keep waiting forever.\nsudo apt-get -o DPkg::Lock::Timeout=-1 install packagename\n\nFor more information see: Waiting for apt locks without the hacky bash scripts.  This option was added to apt-get in February 2020.\n\nA: You can make apt-get to learn to wait if another software manager is running. Something similar with the behaviour from the next screen cast:\n\nHow I made it?\nI create a new script called apt-get (wrapper for apt-get) in /usr/local/sbin directory with the following bash code inside:\n#!/bin/bash\n\ni=0\ntput sc\nwhile fuser /var/lib/dpkg/lock >/dev/null 2>&1 ; do\n    case $(($i % 4)) in\n        0 ) j=\"-\" ;;\n        1 ) j=\"\\\\\" ;;\n        2 ) j=\"|\" ;;\n        3 ) j=\"/\" ;;\n    esac\n    tput rc\n    echo -en \"\\r[$j] Waiting for other software managers to finish...\" \n    sleep 0.5\n    ((i=i+1))\ndone \n\n/usr/bin/apt-get \"$@\"\n\nDon't forget to make it executable:\nsudo chmod +x /usr/local/sbin/apt-get\n\nBefore to test, check if everything is ok. The output of which apt-get command should be now /usr/local/sbin/apt-get. The reason is: by default, the /usr/local/sbin directory is placed before /usr/bin directory in user or root PATH.\n\nA: One-liner based on Oli's answer:\nwhile sudo fuser /var/{lib/{dpkg,apt/lists},cache/apt/archives}/lock >/dev/null 2>&1; do sleep 1; done\n\n\nA: You can use the aptdcon command  to queue up package manager tasks by communicating with aptdaemon instead of using apt-get directly. \nSo basically you can just do sudo aptdcon --install chromium-browser or whatever and while that command is running you can run it again but install different packages and apt-daemon will just queue them up instead of erroring out. \nThis is especially useful if you're doing a long upgrade or something and want to keep installing packages or if you're scripting something together and want to make sure installing things will be more reliable. \n\nA: Unfortunately fuser doesn't do a lot for you when you are running in different unprivileged namespace containers like lxc.  \nAlso, aptdcon is not installed by default (at least on 18.04) and backgrounds your task in a queue so you lose serialization.  This isn't insurmountable, but it does mean your automation needs to have some way to avoid flock errors in apt when installing aptdcon, and you'll need to have some sort of wait loops for anything you need to serialize after installing packages via aptdcon unless there is some sort of flag for that already.\nWhat does work is flock. This should also work over NFS etc as it uses file system locking in the same way apt does, only with the -w seconds parameter it will wait on your lock instead of throwing an error.\nSo following the wrapper model, add this as apt-get in /usr/local/bin/ and share away.\nThis also has the benefit of limiting IO by not allowing parallelism on apt so you can let cron trigger updates at midnight everywhere without beating up the disk.\n#!/bin/bash\nexec /usr/bin/flock -w 900 -F --verbose /var/cache/apt/archives/lock /usr/bin/apt-get $@  \n\nA very nice and simple feature request for apt-get would be a -w flag to switch to a blocking / wait lock.\n\nA: A very simple approach would be a script that waited for the lock to not be open. Let's call it waitforapt and stick it in /usr/local/bin:\n#!/bin/sh\n\nwhile sudo fuser /var/{lib/{dpkg,apt/lists},cache/apt/archives}/lock >/dev/null 2>&1; do\n   sleep 1\ndone\n\nThen just run sudo waitforapt && sudo apt-get install whatever. You could add exceptions into sudoers to allow you to run it without needing a password (you'll need it for the apt-get so it's no great gain).\nUnfortunately this doesn't queue things. Given that some of apt's operations are interactive (\"Are you sure you want to remove all those packages?!\"), I can't see a good way around this...\n\nA: Apart of the obvious &&, you may be looking for aptdcon. This tool is able to detect other instances of apt and wait them to finish:\nsudo aptdcon --safe-upgrade\n[/]  11% Waiting for other software managers to quit Waiting for aptitude\n(I'm running aptitude somewhere else)\nThe advantage of this tool is that you can stock several actions consecutively without being worried of what you will be doing next. aptdcon is ideal for unattended scripts, and GUI installation, since you can allow the tool run in background as not to block your frontend.\nThe operations supported by aptdcon are:\n\n\n*\n\n*--refresh, -c: This is the equivalent to apt-get update. It updates your package list.\n\n*--install, --remove, --upgrade, --purge, --downgrade. Each of them do as their names say. The name of the package(s) is mandatory. -i, -r, -u, -p: these are the short options for all except downgrade, who doesn't have one.\n\n*--safe-upgrade, --full-upgrade are the counterparts to apt-get's upgrade/dist-upgrade and aptitude's safe-upgrade/full-upgrade. These doesn't need parameters.\n\n*There are several others operations, which can be found in the manual. But, these are the most used by users interested in aptd. There are options that overlap with  what apt-key, apt-cache, dpkg do.\n\n\napt-get itself doesn't support such methods (to wait for other instances of apt), so aptdcon is the preferred solution to GUI's package managers: USC uses aptd as back-end, same as Synaptic. Other solution is packagekit, but it doesn't support the function that you are looking for (yet).\n\nA: You could using a polling technique:\n$ time (while ps -opid= -C apt-get > /dev/null; do sleep 1; done); \\\n  apt-get -y install some-other-package\n\n\nA: I made a script which does this:\n#!/bin/bash\n\n# File path to watch\nLOCK_FILE='/var/lib/dpkg/lock'\n\n# tput escape codes\ncr=\"$(tput cr)\"\nclr_end=\"$(tput el)\"\nup_line=\"$(tput cuu 1)\"\n\nCLEAN(){\n    # Cleans the last two lines of terminal output,\n    # returns the cursor to the start of the first line\n    # and exits with the specified value if not False\n\n    echo -n \"$cr$clr_end\"\n    echo\n    echo -n \"$cr$clr_end$up_line\"\n    if [[ ! \"$1\" == \"False\" ]]; then\n        exit $1\n    fi\n}\n\n_get_cmdline(){\n    # Takes the LOCKED variable, expected to be output from `lsof`,\n    # then gets the PID and command line from `/proc/$pid/cmdline`.\n    #\n    # It sets `$open_program` to a user friendly string of the above.\n\n    pid=\"${LOCKED#p}\"\n    pid=`echo $pid | sed 's/[\\n\\r ].*//'`\n    cmdline=()\n    while IFS= read -d '' -r arg; do\n        cmdline+=(\"$arg\")\n    done < \"/proc/${pid}/cmdline\"\n    open_program=\"$pid : ${cmdline[@]}\"\n}\n\n# Default starting value\ni=0\n\n# Checks if the file is locked, writing output to $FUSER\nwhile LOCKED=\"$(lsof -F p \"$LOCK_FILE\" 2>/dev/null)\" ; do\n    # This will be true if it isn't the first run\n    if [[ \"$i\" != 0 ]]; then\n        case $(($i % 4)) in\n            0 ) s='-'\n                i=4\n                _get_cmdline # Re-checks the command line each 4th iteration\n            ;;\n            1 ) s=\\\\ ;;\n            2 ) s='|' ;;\n            3 ) s='/' ;;\n        esac\n    else\n        # Traps to clean up the printed text and cursor position\n        trap \"CLEAN False; trap - SIGINT ; kill -SIGINT $$\" SIGINT\n        trap 'CLEAN $((128+15))' SIGTERM\n        trap 'CLEAN $((128+1))' SIGHUP\n        trap 'CLEAN $((128+3))' SIGQUIT\n\n        # Default starting character\n        s='-'\n\n        _get_cmdline\n        echo -n \"$save_cur\"\n    fi\n    # Prints the 2nd line first so the cursor is at the end of the 1st line (looks nicer)\n    echo\n    echo -n \"$cr$clr_end$open_program\"\n    echo -n \"$up_line$res_cur$cr$clr_end[$s] Waiting for other package managers to finish...\"\n    #echo -en \"$cr$clr_end[$s] Waiting for other package managers to finish...\"\n    #echo -en \"\\n$cr$clr_end$open_program$cr$up_line\"\n    ((i++))\n    sleep 0.025\ndone\n\nCLEAN False\n\n# This allows saving the script under a different name (e.g. `apt-wait`)\n# and running it.

So I would start over from scratch, chances are it'll work fine this time.\n\nA: Did you start with the \"install updates\" option? If so, maybe the default Ubuntu servers are under a load at the time and so the updates are coming very slowly.

There is no video glitch, black screen or other. The resume process just freezes on the Ubuntu splash boot after a few seconds of disk activity.\nIs there a way to fix the system configuration so hibernates works again?\n\nA: Since the solution I found for this is not trivial, I wanted to post it here for the record.\nI read the man page for pm-hibernate, and in the section on the HIBERNATE_MODE configuration option, I saw a mention of the /sys/power/disk file. I remembered that a few years ago I used to debug suspend and hibernate by writing to /sys/power/state. The possible values can be seen by reading the file.\nI tested kernel-level hibernation with sudo sh -c 'echo disk > /sys/power/state'. The system suspended and resumed correctly.\nSo the problem was that pm-hibernate was doing something wrong.\nI tried setting the SLEEP_MODULE option by creating a file /etc/pm/config.d/sleep_module with the content:\nSLEEP_MODULE=tuxonice\n\nAnd that fixed resuming after pm-hibernate.\nThen, I needed to create a file /etc/polkit-1/localauthority/50-local.d/com.ubuntu.enable-hibernate.pkla as explained here.\nAnd I had a fully working hibernate feature for my ThinkPad X60.\nThere is probably a bug to be filed in Launchpad about this, but I do not know what it would be.\nI have had some stability issues with hibernate since applying this fix. So far, it has failed to resume once, and it failed to hibernate once. So be careful. Another sleep module might be more reliable, but I cannot test that until I can reproduce the problems.\n\nA: Dell Latitude E6500 here. I had the same problem. Here's what fixed it:\nsudo apt-get purge uswsusp\nSLEEP_MODE is in default kernel mode. Now it hibernates like a champ. Apparently, uswsusp works imprecisely with the Precise Pangolin. \n\nA: Following ddaa's advice, I set SLEEP_MODULE=tuxonice on my Lenovo T420s. That improved matters: sometimes my computer comes back from hibernation properly, sometimes the screen remains half grey, half black. It's only the display that fails since I can still log on blindly with ctrl+alt f1, then do a pm-suspend, and after the computer wakes up the display is back.\nAs a workaround, do a 'sudo pm-hibernate' to hibernate without locking the screen. When the display doesn't wake up, simply press the suspend button Fn-F4 (the half moon) and switch the computer back on. This resets the screen.\n\nA: Similar problem here, using HP FOLIO 13 and Ubuntu 12.04. pm-hibernate power off but when I power cycle, it acts as cold boot. I tried echo disk > /sys/power/state and it does not hibernate. Tried both kernel and tuxonice on sleep_mode with no success.\nSince initially looking at this, I've discovered what was wrong: swap space was encrypted, thus hibernate doesn't know how to resume.\nSolution here and here.\n\nA: I had a similar problem with my Thinkpad T400 and Precise: After going to hibernation, the system would do a cold boot rather than resume from disk. \nAfter playing with the solutions proposed here I found that all I had to do was add the kernel option\nresume=UUID=9e9418e7-25fc-49eb-8200-e8921a91a0cb\nto the list of options under GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT in the file /etc/default/grub. 9e9418e7-25fc-49eb-8200-e8921a91a0cb is the UUID of my swap partition, (where the hibernation data is saved to). Needless to say, you have to change this according to your specific system! \nSubsequently the bootloader configuration needed to be updated with\nsudo update-grub\nAfter that hibernation worked on the level of the kernel (i.e. using pm_hibernate or other CLI-tools). To enable triggering of hibernation from the user interface (KDE in my case) I had to install the policy-override as mentioned before and explained here.\nLike Stephen, I use the kernel-side suspend function, as uswsusp does not work for me (freezes on resume). Up to now my Thinkpad has always resumed correctly with this configuration.\n\nA: This is how I fixed it for me - \nTo hibernate, run\n$ sudo pm-hibernate\n\nHowever, if resuming fails after hibernation, then \nin /etc/default/grub file, replace the line \nGRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX=\"\"\n\nwith\nGRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX=\"resume=/dev/sdaX\"\n\nWhere, /dev/sdX is the swap partition. \nAfter this, run\n$ sudo update-grub\n\nand hibernation should work now.\nHowever, using this method, the screen doesn't lock after resuming, for which I've asked a question here.\n", "Q: Can't get external wifi antenna to work, or find one that works I have an external wifi antenna (alfa), which worked with windows but not with ubuntu.\nMy computer is a small laptop eee pc.

(i can apparently only post 2 links)\nThe following thinks this is error output from an onboard card reader:\nhttps://bbs.archlinux.org/viewtopic.php?pid=1059099\nIt's confirmed to be an upstream issue in \nhttps://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/linux/+bug/987993\nRun lsusb and find the offending device\n\nnathan@Ham-Bone:~$ lsusb \n\nBus 001 Device 001: ID 1d6b:0002 Linux Foundation 2.0 root hub\nBus 002 Device 001: ID 1d6b:0002 Linux Foundation 2.0 root hub\nBus 003 Device 001: ID 1d6b:0001 Linux Foundation 1.1 root hub\nBus 004 Device 001: ID 1d6b:0001 Linux Foundation 1.1 root hub\nBus 005 Device 001: ID 1d6b:0001 Linux Foundation 1.1 root hub\nBus 006 Device 001: ID 1d6b:0001 Linux Foundation 1.1 root hub\nBus 007 Device 001: ID 1d6b:0001 Linux Foundation 1.1 root hub\nBus 008 Device 001: ID 1d6b:0001 Linux Foundation 1.1 root hub\nBus 001 Device 002: ID 0bda:0158 Realtek Semiconductor Corp. USB 2.0 multicard reader\n\nIn my case it's the Realtek multicard reader which a quick check of \n\n$ dmesg | grep realtek\n[    4.716068] usbcore: registered new interface driver ums-realtek\n$ lsmod | grep realtek\nums_realtek            17920  0 \n\nreveals a module ums-realtek\n\n$sudo rmmod ums_realtek\n\nFixes the problem in a reversible way for me. That is \n\n$sudo modprobe ums_realtek\n\nenables the card reader again. I haven't tested if it works since I never use it.\nIf this doesn't work there are some other ways to disable usb devices by unbinding them in the /sys/ directory.\n\nA: I found that loading the driver with option ss_en=0 works. Doing\necho \"ums-realtek ss_en=0\" |sudo tee -a /etc/modules\n\nmakes the change permanent.\nFurther explanation:\nWhile trying to discover why this message happens, I looked into the options for the two modules involved, ums-realtek and usb-storage. I did not feel that loading and unloading the ums-realtek module every time was a suitable solution, as I am often using the card reader. \nChecking module options:\n# modinfo ums-realtek \n  parm: auto_delink_en  enable auto delink (int)\n  parm: ss_en           enable selective suspend (int)\n  parm: ss_delay        seconds to delay before entering selective suspend (int)\n\nResearch into what these options were for did not yield any result, and I did not feel inclined to bother the author by email. Since this driver uses the usb-storage as well, I felt the \"suspend\" option might be enabled by default ( perhaps to conserve battery on laptops ) and the messages a result of wakeup-query-suspend sequences. Since I didn't care if the device was constantly powered on or not, I tried setting this option to 0 (off) and it works.  \n\nA: Unloading the driver works for me !\nI never use the cardreader so this was a fine option otherwise I would have set the 'ss_en=0' option.\n\nA: I got the same output in dmesg when I inadvertently had gotten the IDE connector to a disk one step misaligned at the IDE to USB adapter. That may be the cause of your problem. \n\nA: i was getting the same issue after i installed ubuntu 12.04 server. I installed gedit to alter the logging level(dont laugh about the fact that i use gedit). When gedit was installing it also installed many archive packages from ubuntu.com. After installation i left my monitor on and the pc untouched to see if it happens again and it didnt. This seems to have solved the issue for me. Im not saying go and install gedit but there maybe away to install the archive packages that come with gedit.

On the first 3 computers I can use things like \"Alt-Tab\" and I can use the \"Super/Windows\" key to get into overview mode while playing games and it functions absolutely flawless, I can even move the game to another deaktop and continue playing. However on the 4th Computer neither \"Alt-Tab\" or \"Super\" Do anything, as a matter of fact if I hit them more than once the window will loose focus and I have to shutdown to get out of the game.

It's not, that I'm missing the Hibernate option (I'm aware, that Canonical dropped this option due to a bunch of reasons), but when I wish to suspend the system, it proceeds as it should with the suspend, but immediately wakes up again.\nSo our problem is not the missing hibernate capability, but the fact, that the system doesn't stay suspended/hibernated and immediately wakes up.\nI found a bunch of solutions to this problem but on older systems (see http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=1444822). Unfortunately it does not help with the new kernel.\nThis is a critical problem for me. I use suspend 3-4 times a day. The only version, where the suspend worked on my laptop was 11.04.

Some users have suggested that a BIOS update my help. \nDISCLAIMER: I cannot confirm any of this outside that the error occurs, and that windows does indeed experience the same issues when installed with gpt. If I do decide to follow the workaround (very risky) or update the BIOS (even more risky) and get some further results I'll update.\n", "Q: Is there a fast way to show your desktop \nPossible Duplicate:\nWhat are Unity’s keyboard and mouse shortcuts? \n\nI need to see content on my desktop or a folder just pressing an icon or a couple of keys. \nHow i do this on unity?\n\nA: You can access desktop just by a movement of mouse...!\nFollow these steps to set it up!\nInstall Ubuntu Tweak:\nPress Alt+Ctrl+T to open the terminal and run the following commands one by one.\n\nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:tualatrix/ppa\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get install ubuntu-tweak\n\nPress Super key (Windows key) to open the dash and search for \"Ubuntu Tweak\" and open it.\n\nConfiguration:\nClick on the \"Tweaks\" tab of Ubuntu Tweak (2nd tab from left) and select workspace.\n\nHare you can bind four action to four corners of your screen.

I've gotten trusted Ubuntu too much perhaps (have been a user for a few years) so I haven't backed up my drive..\nMany thanks for any suggestions..\n\nA: A possible solution might be to try and reinstall Grub by booting into live. Boot into live, open a terminal, run \"sudo fdisk -l\" and find out on which partition you installed Ubuntu. It will be something like /dev/sda5. Mount that partition somewhere. You can do this by \"mount /dev/sda5 /mnt\" and run the following command to install/reinstall grub.\nsudo grub-install --root-directory=/mnt/ /dev/sda (Note: It might not be sda. That depends on your hard disk's name which will be shown by \"sudo fdisk -l\").\nTry restarting after this and hopefully it will work. :)\nOr, you can boot into live and mount the partition in which you have data on and copy that data from there too.\nYou might want to refer to http://sosaysharis.wordpress.com/2011/06/29/recovering-grub-after-installing-windows-using-ubuntu/\n\nA: Make a CD of Super Grub Boot disc; it will find all the OSs and allow you to choose and boot.\nAlso try 'Try Ubuntu' from the Live CD, and install into it Grub Customizer.

I was wondering now if I could resize my lubuntu partition so I can install windows 7 again. \nHere is a gparted screenshot: \n\nCan anyone help me out? I have all my Linux disks and my windows disks.\nThank you.\n\nA: You can't resize a mounted partition and since you are already in Ubuntu, the / partition is mounted. What you need to do is to boot into live by making a USB bootable with Ubuntu and launch gparted from there. In gparted, right-click your /dev/sda4 and you can resize it according to your wish.\n\nA: In order to adjust your disc partitions with Gparted, the disc needs to be accessed from 'outside' as it were. You do this by getting Ubuntu going from the Live CD (ie 'boot into live') and then run Gparted from there. Ubuntu is then running from RAM rather than your hard disc.\nIf dev/sda1 still exists as your screenshot shows, you should be able to reinstate your old Win7 to that ntfs partition.\nAnd yes, you can resize your Ubuntu partition, but only by using the Live CD as in paragraph 1.\n\nA: The best thing I would suggest you, in case you can bear to lose your data(seems like you don't have much left ;-)), is first cleaning up your entire disk using gparted by inserting your Lubuntu or Windows 7 CD/DVD/USB and then installing Windows 7 followed by Lubuntu after checking what errors you are getting about partitioning while installing Windows 7.\n", "Q: DVD-RW does not mount in Ubuntu 12.04 LTS I try to use CDs and DVDs in my Ubuntu Precise Pangolin (12.04 LTS), but the system doesn't mount the DVD-Recorder when the DVD or CD is ready to use.

How Ubuntu 12.04 LTS can mount optical media (CD, DVD, Blu-Ray) recorders?\n\nA: non-blank media:\nAs it seems, by default non-blank media (CD, DVD) does not mount automatically.

I think it is the default behaviour.\nnothing shows up:\nIf there is nothing new in the devices area in nautilus, this is a bad sign. Your drive might not be connected (check the cables).\nAs ashutosh pointed out, to find out if the recorder was recognized, type dmesg | grep \"sr0\" in a terminal. You should get a response similar to:\n[    1.649270] sr0: scsi3-mmc drive: 40x/40x writer dvd-ram cd/rw xa/form2 cdda tray\n[    1.649445] sr 0:0:0:0: Attached scsi CD-ROM sr0\n\ncheck mounted non-blank media:\nTo be sure there it is not mounted execute this in a terminal: mount | grep \"/dev/sr\"\nIf the response is blank there is no non-blank media mounted in your media drive. Blank media is not showing up here.\nNote:\nyour drive might be called sr1 or sr2 if you have several; in that case replace sr0 with sr1 in that case (or simply sr to catch them all).\n", "Q: Ubuntu won't boot after 12.04 upgrade I installed Ubuntu 11.10 a few weeks ago and yesterday I upgraded it to 12.04.

I recently installed Ubuntu 12.04 onto my primary computer, replacing Ubuntu 11.10. I used the fresh install method, wiping all data off of the HDD and starting from scratch using a flash drive for the 12.04 installation.\nUpon first boot at the Ubuntu loading screen, a message appears indicating Ubuntu is mounting a separate partition. It gives me the option to wait, or cancel and mount manually later.\nI have never made a separate partition, but for some reason I had a 1 GB sized partition laying around on my system after installation.\nI don't know why or how it is there, because like I said I JUST installed 12.04. The partition is a logical, 1012 MB sized unknown file system.\n\n\nSo, my question is, I would like to know if I can merge it back into my primary partition. Because the partition slows boot up time, and is pretty useless to me. I would also like to know what exactly happened, and how I can prevent it in the future.\nThanks!\n\nA: You can try deleting that 1GB partiton and then extending dev/sda1.\nI'm guessing, but could it be that you used the 'Try Ubuntu' option before installing it to hard disc permanently??\nFor Ubuntu you need to have a 'Swap' partition, and my guess is that this what the !GB was intended for at installation. rather than deleting it I'd suggest you format it as a 'Swap' partition.\nTo format the 1GB partition, place your mouse pointer over the respective line in the Gparted window and click your RH mouse button. Up will pop a menu offering 'Format'. Click the LH button on the word 'Format'. You will then see a small pop-up window offering a seletcion of different formats, choose 'Swap', then OK out of it all.\nBut if you really do want to delete it then::-MOST IMPORTANT>>>>>> BE VERY CAREFUL THAT YOU DO NOT DELETE THE MAIN PARTITION BY ACCIDENT.\nTo delete the 1GB partition, place your mouse pointer over the respective line in the Gparted window and click your RH mouse button. Up will pop a menu offering 'delete'. Click the LH button on the word 'delete'.\nFollowing that you can repeat the operation to delete the 1GB extended partition. You'll then have some unallocated space which can be used to extend you main partition.\nTo extend your main partition you place your mouse pointer over the respective line in the Gparted window and click your RH mouse button. Up will pop a menu offering 'move/resize'. Click the LH button on the word 'move/resize'.\nI think you'll be able to work out what to do there.\nAT ALL TIMES DOUBLE CHECK WHAT YOU ARE ABOUT TO DO. Good luck.\n", "Q: Alt-tab behavior Couple of ALT+Tab issues (Ubuntu 12.04):\nCurrently ALT+Tab only switches between windows in the current workplace.

I want to install Ubuntu 12.04 in my pc.\n\nA: The question you have asked is one that occurs frequently. The difficulty we have answering your question is that it is hard for us to determine from what you have written in your question what steps you actually performed. \nThe following questions and suggestions are an attempt to better understand (and fix) your problem.\nSince this problem occurs frequently, there is also a great deal of help information for it. The first thing you should do is look at this BootFromCD article in the Ubuntu Community Help wiki. \nWhile the first three topics in that help article have already been raised in earlier comments or answers, I'll review them again to make sure these possibilities have been considered.\n\n\n*\n\n*CD/DVD was not burned properly\n\nWe need to verify that the media you are attempting to boot from was created correctly. I assume you have downloaded one of the these two Live CD ISO images:\nubuntu-12.04-desktop-i386.iso\nubuntu-12.04-desktop-amd64.iso\n\nAn ISO image file is similiar to an archive file in that it is actually a large number of separate files and folders which have been stored in a single file. What you want to burn to a CD is the content of the ISO file, not the ISO file itself.\n\nThe screen captures in this section say it all. If you open the CD/DVD you created with the file manager of any operating system, what do you see?\n\nIf you see just a single ISO file (as illustrated by this \"Incorrect\" screenshot) then you burned the CD/DVD incorrectly. Please try again after looking over the information on this BurningIsoHowto page.\n\n*BIOS is not set to boot from CD or DVD drive\n\nMy understanding from one of your comments is that your system uses an  Intel DG31PR motherboard, correct? If so, then  by pressing F2 when your system boots you will enter your BIOS configuration where you can make persistent changes to your BIOS settings.\n\nYou can use this method to change the boot priority settings for your devices in your BIOS. \n\n*PC requires you to hold down or press a key to boot from CD\n\nThe other approach you can use with a DG31PR motherboard is to temporarily change which device the BIOS bootloader boots from. I prefer this method because you do not have to make persistent changes to your BIOS settings. The change only applies to the current boot.\n\nTo do this press F10 when your system boots. A menu similar to the example below should appear allowing you to (temporarily) select your CD as the boot device.\n\n \nCould you please look at these suggestions and update/edit the body of you question to let us know whether they helped or not? We need to make sure that your install media and BIOS boot device selections are correct before we can consider other possibilities.\n\nA: Trying using f6 and checking x next to all those options, including \"free software only\"\nSeems to work on a power spec desktop circa 2012\n\nA: Did you select any option of boot device priority in BIOS?\nAlso try to find a message like: \"Press  to select boot device\" when the disc is inserted to the drive and you're booting the computer.\n\nA: Simply burning the ISO might not have made the disk bootable. You have a few options.\nWith that iso, make thumb drive bootable. This can be done either on an already installed ubuntu (10.04 or above) with the \"Startup disk creator\" utility or you can make your thumb drive bootable using \"UNetbootin\" in windows. I know it is used but haven't used it myself. \nTry booting using these and also make sure that the iso you downloaded is not corrupted. Refer to this https://help.ubuntu.com/community/HowToMD5SUM\n\nA: First of all, what happens if you put in a DVD that you have used before? Is it the DVD drive at fault?\nIf you can, try burning another DVD, but remember not to remove it before it is completely finished.\nI would not bother going through the upgrade route, it will take ages. How about creating an new partition on your hard disc for 12.04, and keeping your 8.10 going as a backup? Then you can install 12.04 fresh to the new partition.\n\nA: I had the exact same problem. I was finally able to get the CD to boot by pressing F6 at the boot menu, selecting both acpi=off and noapic, and then selecting \"Try without installing\".\nYou might try that.\n", "Q: Shotwell with Dropbox I import all my photos with Shotwell into a folder within my Dropbox so all the photos are available to other devices.  However, most importing is done on Linux laptop and while photos are available on the Linux desktop (a separate machine) the databases seem to be different so I have difficulty locating photos.   Can anyone suggest a remedy ?\nSupplementary question - if I add tags to the photos on, say the desktop, are these applied on the laptop as well ?\n\nA: I would suggest two things:\n\n\n*\n\n*First - use symlinks to route shotwell into using the pictures directory of the dropbox folder for its photo store.\n\n*second - ensuring you do not have shotwell open at the same time on both machines - although dropbox has conflict resolution, for the shotwell internal db files it will probably only allow you to select one or the other of the versions.\n\n\nThis method should mean the tags will be shared too.\n\nA: By default, Shotwell stores all metadata only in its database. There's an option in the Preferences to enable writing metadata into files (it's on the first tab in Preferences in Metadata section). This way you get tags in sync.\nEdit: Expanding on the Danny's answer, you could also sync Shotwell's database directly if you want to sync everything. This will however work only if your photos are stored in the same location on all computers where you want to sync the database.\nEdit: Recent versions of Ubuntu (e.g. 13.10) store the Shotwell data in ~/.local/share/shotwell/dat\nThis can theoretically lead to database corruption or data loss if you have both Dropbox and Shotwell running on multiple computers (and therefore there's a risk of edit conflicts).\nDatabase is stored in ~/.shotwell/data/photo.db – either symlink it or move it into Dropbox (and then symlink it back) – I will assume you use ~/Dropbox directory.\nRun this on your laptop (where the database is most up-to-date):\nmv ~/.shotwell/data/photo.db ~/Dropbox/photo.db\nln -s ~/Dropbox/photo.db ~/.shotwell/data/photo.db\n\nNow on your desktop, backup or remove the local database:\nmv ~/.shotwell/data/photo.db ~/.shotwell/data/photo.db.original\n\n(or to remove: rm ~/.shotwell/data/photo.db)\nAnd again, symlink the synchronised database from Dropbox to the original location:\nln -s ~/Dropbox/photo.db ~/.shotwell/data/photo.db\n\n\nA: A simple one liner zsh command can link all your pictures from Shotwell into your Dropbox account. Try this:\ncd Dropbox/Photos/\nzsh ;\nzsh> foreach f in find ~/Pictures/**2013** -name '*.JPG'; do ; echo $f ; ln -fs $f . ; done;\nzsh> foreach f in find ~/Pictures/**2012** -name '*.JPG'; do ; echo $f ; ln -fs $f . ; done;\nThe softlinks are created from Shotwell into Dropbox/Photos folder. These files are then synced into your Dropbox account and availabe on multiple computers, without affecting your Shotwell libary.\nThen you can do the same from the other Linux computer as well. \nAs long as the image names which are being linked into Dropbox are unique between multiple computers, there should be no problem and all photos will come into Dropbox.\n", "Q: 12.04 Ubuntu - Sharing Wireless Internet Connection with Freesat through ethernet!

I have tried everything I can think of but I am stumped.\nTo clarify, I am changing the theme using Gnome Tweak. Themes were obtained from various repositories including noobslab/themes and webupd8. As an example, when using the default theme adwaita, I get all notifications when using Rhythmbox as to what song is being played on an internet radio station. I even tried a different media player with the same result. When I change the theme, all I get is a media player Icon.  Change back to default theme and all Notifications work fine.  Notifications were working at first with all themes, but no longer. The question is how to get Notifications to work for all themes. They did for previous versions of Gnome-shell.\n\nA: I've found how fix this:\nIt's in the gnome-shell.css file from the theme package. Some id definitions need the class name definition:\nExample:\n#notification {\n\nChange to this:\n#notification, .notification {\n\nand some other definition... to sumup you have to compare with the gnome-shell.css file in /usr/share/gnome-shell/theme.\n", "Q: Any way of changing the partition size of a Ubuntu install from inside the install? Is there anyway to change the partition size of Ubuntu while using Ubuntu? I currently have 2 partitions and would like to shrink the one I have Ubuntu installed on to make a storage partition so I can easily format and reinstall without constantly backing up personal files.\n\nA: The smart answer is to boot from the Ubuntu Live CD or USB, which has gparted on it, from which you can easily resize the partitions on your hard drive without any of them needing to be mounted.  It has a nice GUI and it makes it easy.  No brainer.  If you don't want a broken system, do that.  (And make sure your data's backed up always!)\nIf you really want to know if it's possible to resize a partition while actually running Ubuntu from that partition, then the answer is that it may be, but I definitely wouldn't recommend it unless you love taking risks.\n\n\n*\n\n*The ext3 file system allows for live resizing - enlarging a partition while it's active and mounted.  This would not allow you to shift the partition left or right, nor to shrink it, but to enlarge a partition.\n\n*If you use LVM (an alternative to partitioning, sort of) then you can move, resize, etc partitions while live without any problems.  This is complex.\n\n*From the root recovery prompt, you may be able to resize or move those partitions other than the root partition.  This is very advanced.\n\nA: There is no way to change the partition size while the partition is in use unless you are using LVM which is only available in the alternate installer and requires some knowledge of the LVM system to use.\nSorry. :)\nTo achieve what you want you need a Live CD/USB. You can do the transformation and then adjust the mount points in /etc/fstab of the root partition. There are some intricacies but they are mostly answered on askubuntu or other places. If in need - ask another question about that.\n\nA: You can not change partitions while they are mounted. \nBest method: create a gParted bootable CD/DVD and use gparted from there or click here for the download itself.\nYoutube Video demostrating this.\n", "Q: Installing Ubuntu from usb pendrive on hard disk I have downloaded Ubuntu 12.04 desktop iso.

I don't wish to run Ubuntu off the pen drive and would rather install it on hard disk itself. \nAny help would be appreciated.\n\nA: Yes it is possible to create bootable USB from an ISO within Windows. It is not exactly by copying an ISO to the USB key, however it's almost as simple. The instructions are located here: How to create a bootable USB stick on Windows | Ubuntu\nAfterwards you can boot from the USB as if you booted from a CD and proceed to install Ubuntu on your hard disk.\n\nA: Yes, its possible.

If your intent is to keep all of your files, but upgrade Ubuntu to this newest version, simply run Update Manager from your existing Ubuntu 11.10 installation, and choose to upgrade to Ubuntu 12.04. Update Manager allows you to easily upgrade to a newer version of Ubuntu while keeping all of you files. If you are sure you want to remove Ubuntu 11.10 instead of upgrading, proceed with the instructions below.\nTo remove Ubuntu 11.10 from your computer to install Ubuntu 12.04, you will first need a Live Cd or a Live USB. After you boot into it, select Try Ubuntu. Then, you will need to open Gparted, and delete the partition that Ubuntu 11.10 is installed on. Then, you can install Ubuntu 12.04\n", "Q: Booting in kiosk mode How can we configure the machine to boot directly into a restricted interface, with limited options that we can configure?

I enabled run command as a login shell as suggested in this answer about the same topic setting up RVM, but when I do this the .bashrc file is not read.\nFor example, I create an environment variable in .bashrc and then when I start a new gnome-terminal I cannot read it. I need to run explicitly source .bashrc to read the file.\nIs this the expected behavior?\n\nA: Yes, that is the expected behaviour.\nThe behaviour, in short, is as follows:\n\n\n*\n\n*bash started as an interactive login shell: reads ~/.profile\n\n*bash started as an interactive non-login shell: reads ~/.bashrc\nRead the bash manual about startup files for more details.\nPersonally, I think that this behaviour is strange and I have not yet found a rationalization for this design decision.\n\nSome explanation of the terminology:\n\n\n*\n\n*An interactive shell is a shell with which you can interact, that means you can type commands in it. Most shells you will use are interactive shells.\n\n*A non-interactive shell is a shell with which you cannot interact. Shell scripts run inside non-interactive shells.\n\n*A login shell is the shell which is started when you login to your system.\n\n*A non-login shell is a shell which is started after the login process.\n\n\nMost shells you see are interactive non-login shells. This is especially true if you are running a graphical environment like gnome, because then gnome is the \"login shell\". Any bash session started inside gnome is a non-login shell. If you want to see a real interactive login shell then go to a virtual console (using Ctrl+Alt+F1) and then log in using your username and password. That is a real interactive login bash shell. You can go back to the graphical shell using Ctrl+Alt+F7.\nThere is an option --login which will make bash behave as if it is a login shell even if started after your have logged in. Configuring gnome-terminal to start bash as a login shell means it will start bash using the --login option.\n\nUsually you want bash to always read ~/.bashrc in an interactive shell. Here is how I recommend to do that:\nCreate a ~/.bash_profile file. If bash is started as a login shell it will first look for ~/.bash_profile before looking for ~/.profile. If bash finds ~/.bash_profile then it will not read ~/.profile.\nPut the following lines in ~/.bash_profile:\n[ -f \"$HOME/.profile\" ] && source \"$HOME/.profile\"\n[ -f \"$HOME/.bashrc\" ] && source \"$HOME/.bashrc\"\n\nNow if bash is started as an interactive login shell it will read the following files:\n\n\n*\n\n*~/.bash_profile\n\n*~/.profile\n\n*~/.bashrc\nand if bash is started as an interactive non-login shell:\n\n\n*\n\n*~/.bashrc\nYou should put stuff which is bash specific in ~/.bashrc and stuff which is not bash specific in ~/.profile. For example PATH goes in ~/.profile and HISTCONTROL goes in ~/.bashrc.\nNote that ~/.profile is not bash specific. Other text based shells (for example sh or ksh) and graphical shells (gnome) also read ~/.profile. That is why you should not put bash specific stuff in ~/.profile.\n\nA: This is neither a bad design decision, nor a bug, nor an expected behavior of shells and terminals\nIt is merely an unfortunate default value of a  per-profile configuration option in Gnome Terminal, which you can easily fix.\n\n\n*\n\n*Go to Edit -> Profile Preferences.\n\n*Select the Title and Command tab.\n\n*Notice how the Run command as login shell checkbox is unchecked! Check it.\nThat's it. If you do this to the Default profile, or to whatever profile is configured to be used when making new terminals, you get a login shell.\nI'm guessing that under the hood, this option probably causes it to pass the -l option to the shell.\n\nA: I had the same question, and found a solution: Simply use SSH for a real login shell!\n1. As superuser, create a dedicated rvm system user for complete isolation, and assign a password:\nsudo su\nuseradd -m rvmuser\npasswd rvmuser\n2. Install dependencies so that rvm can build rubies without asking for the superuser password:\napt-get install curl gawk libreadline6-dev libssl-dev libyaml-dev libsqlite3-dev sqlite3 autoconf libgdbm-dev libncurses5-dev automake bison libffi-dev\n3. SSH into localhost for a real login shell (you may have to apt-get install ssh)\nssh rvmuser@localhost\n4. Install rvm\n\\curl -sSL https://get.rvm.io | bash -s stable\n5. Log out and back in again so that all rvm functions are loaded\nexit\nssh rvmuser@localhost\n6. Use rvm :)\n\nA: It is common to when using bash to place the profile initialization in .bash_profile, which is read only by bash on login, whereas other shells have historically shared .profile. \nThis allows you to place bash-specific commands in .bash_profile.\nUse of the following is commonly done to pull in the aliases that are defined in .bashrc:\n# Get the aliases and functions\nif [ -f ~/.bashrc ]; then\n    . ~/.bashrc\nfi\n\n", "Q: Add terminal session with network to login in screen I want to add a terminal Xsession to the log in drop down screen.

Do I need to set a path? How can I make it to work?\n\nA: First, you should move the Sun JDK from /usr/lib/jvm to /usr/local/lib/jvm. Let the package manager manage all files in /usr, except under /usr/local, which is for files not managed by the package manager.\njava and other executables need to be in your path.

So you need to one of two things:\n\n\n*\n\n*Add the /usr/local/lib/jvm/bin directory to your path.\n\n*Create symbolic links from /usr/local/lib/jvm/bin to /usr/local/bin, by typing the following commands in a terminal:\ncd /usr/local/bin\nln -s ../lib/jvm/bin/* .\n\nI recommend the second method, that's what /usr/local/bin is for.\n\nA: You can also refer to the following article: http://www.webupd8.org/2010/04/java-update-script-for-ubuntu-version.html\nIt has reference to the Java Update Script; works like a charm if you want to download and install the JDK manually.

I noticed in my system monitor app, on the \"Processes\" tab, that one can change the 'priority' of a certain program. What specifically would this do?

This is primarily used to keep an app (like the Arista transcoder) from eating all of the cpu time and slowing the system to a crawl, OR, for allowing one app to suck up as much CPU as it can regardless of the consequences. \nIt is not possible by default to raise the priority of running apps. This includes after you have lowered the priority.

Open a terminal and type the following: \nsudo iwconfig wlan0 power off  \n\nHit Enter. This is assuming that your wireless is labeled as wlan0. To check, in an open terminal simply type:  \niwconfig  \n\nIt should list three things such as lo, wlan0 and eth0 although they may be labeled differently. Also, it would help if you could type in:  \nlspci  \n\nThis will allow us to ascertain what wireless chip you are using.\nIf by switching off the power management works, then to make it permanent follow the instructions given by sagarchalise here:  \nHow can I prevent iwconfig power management from being turned on? \n\nA: I just installed 12.04LTS too.\nI have a HP Pavilion dv7.\nFirst solution on www.unixmen.com/resolve-slow-connexion-when-using-wifi-in-ubuntu-1104-natty-narwhal/ worked.\nNote: The file didn't exist but in the empty file I typed what was asked.\nRestarting the system did the job.

I have a really nasty problem when printing with Ubuntu 12.04 x64: Text resolution is wrong. Bitmaps and vector graphics print perfectly at 2400 or 600 dpi, but text does not. It looks ugly, resolution feels really low.\nWhen using Inkscape, turning texts into paths before printing solves the problem (of course, this is not a suitable workaround for everyday use).\nThe printer, a Brother HL4150CDN, is used with CUPS, connected to ethernet port, and fails whatever network address (LPD or IPP) is configured in CUPS. I can print from anywhere (Firefox, Inkscape, Evince), but it still fails with texts. \nPrinter test page outputs successfully\nThe problem depends on the font used: Arial goes wrong, but Nimbus Roman feels right (some fonts are probably substitued by the printer ?), that is probably why Courier text within the printer test page is correctly printed.\nI tried to reproduce this problem with previous versions of Ubuntu without success. I tried fresh installs of Ubuntu 11.10 and 12.04 desktop amd64 with updates, and with the Brother driver: the problem is always there on 12.04, never on 11.10.\nThe currently installed driver is the official Brother driver with PPD files, and the ia32-libs dependency:\n hl4150cdnlpr-1.1.1-5.i386.deb\n hl4150cdncupswrapper-1.1.1-5.i386.deb\n\nHere is a scan of a really poor quality aliased text output with quality settings at 2400x600 dpi.

Any ideas about what I can try to fix it?\nNOTE: Sorry for creating another one of these threads, but since I knew the exact command I executed to blow it all up, I thought that might make a difference :)\n\nA: Just use any live cd to boot into recovery and then select the hard disk and navigate to the bin folder of your installed ubuntu.

Just locate the root partition of the drive and write down its device name. It will have the device listed out in order:\n/dev/sda1\n/dev/sda2\n/dev/sda3\n....\n....\n\nJust note down the device name of your root partition, let you can use Gparted to examine the partitons in a better way. But finding out the root partition is what you all care about. Now suppose /sda2 is your root partition(I assume). Just go to terminal and mount the device by\nsudo mkdir /mnt //in case live cd does not have /mnt folder.\nsudo mount /dev/sda2\n\nNow when you get your device mounted, Just navigate to it as:\nsudo lshw \n\nand note down the root device serial number \ncd /media\ncd device-logical-number  // for ex- mine have A272B6CF72B6A785\n\nand now you can cd to bin directory and can apply permission there.\n", "Q: Do all apps start with a normal priority on the system monitor? I noticed that on my system monitor, one of my processes, titled pulseaudio, had a very high priority, while all of my other running apps had a normal priority. I don't recall ever changing it, so it must have been its default priority, right? Are there any other apps like this?\n\nA: Technically, yes. In Linux — Ubuntu's kernel — all programs start with a priority or \"niceness\" value of 0. They may, while executing, request a higher or lower priority by making the system call nice(int niceness) from unistd.h.\nNormally, programs the user runs only have the permission to lower their priority to positive niceness. This is useful for non-critical janitorial tasks your computer performs from time to time.\nHowever, Ubuntu also uses a framework called AppArmor, which grants specific user programs administrative (\"root\") level rights. Ubuntu's AppArmor is configured to allow certain important programs to request a high priority (negative niceness), most notably PulseAudio. This prevents breaks in playing audio while your system is under heavy load.\nIn summary, yes all applications start with a normal priority. However, in practice, many applications request a different priority immediately after launching.\nAnd as a little geeky addendum\nYou can start (or to be technically accurate, fork) your own programs with low/high priority in a commandline like this:\nnice -n 10 my_app                 # this application is low priority, very nice\nsudo nice -n -10 my_other_app     # this application is high priority, very mean\n\nNo guarantees they'll keep it, of course. \n\nA: Usually there's a pretty good reason why some process have an elevated priority – PulseAudio handles audio mixing, high priority reduces audio drop outs.\nHowever PulseAudio is mostly an exception. You need root permissions to boost process' priority, so you probably won't see any other such processes owned by a regular user.\nThere are many system processes and threads running with maximum priority (you can see them in System Monitor by switching to View > All Processes), but there's no need to be concerned about those.\n", "Q: Application to connect phone to PC and call other phones Here is my dilemma.

It looks on all partitions and outputs a diagnostic if it can't find it.\nSomething like this would mean that the first partition is FAT32 and there is no /wubildr:\nTry (hd0,0): FAT32: No wubildr\nThis isn't an error. You can copy the wubildr to the root of the first partition to stop it showing, or just ignore it (my recommendation).\nThere is another message that shows on all Wubi installs:\nError: 'prefix' not set\nThere's nothing you can do to get rid of this. (No known workarounds). It's registered as a bug. My advice, is to ignore it, or install a normal dual boot if it bothers you that much.\n\nA: Why don't you just check out this forum. it may help you the most.

I made one 65gb partition on c: which was named L: drive.\nI was hoping to install Ubuntu on the partition, but I made mistakes and lost all of d: drive and Ubuntu also grabbed L: drive.\nI want to first see if I can recover as much of my music as possible. And then uninstall Ubuntu from the d: and re-install it to the L: partition on c: drive.\nI need help with all of the questions I have typed.  I know nothing about Ubuntu, that is why I was trying to install it.\nCan I do any of the questions I have asked.\nrod\n\nA: I could not understand first that how could you make a partition inside a partition when a operating system is installed on that. I mean isn't it like cutting the branch of tree on which you are sitting. But above all, only recovering your data matters here first. So let me be clear. \nIf you have completely wiped of all your data, then it is possible to recover some part of it(as they have traces on magnetic tape surrounded on hard disk sectors). Since you are using windows, So I would recommend you to use some window based recovery application. \"Easus get data back\" is the one for you to recover the data. But music is the thing that you can grab easily from the internet. Then Just try to install ubuntu in a separate partition as further you might mistakenly loose c: drive and then you could not even start an OS.\n\nA: First of all: use the affected PC as little as possible! Every write access on your overwritten HDD could erase a little of your music library. If you are on this PC now reading this, shut it down! Boot this PC only from live CDs!\nSecondly, what you will have to do in order to recover your data is not so easy ... so if you think you can't do it and you know a PC expert or something you should ask him/her for help. And don't panic! When you work this out slowly and carefully, there might be much to recover.\nYou should make an entire backup of your D: drive ASAP from which you could restore files later. When your Ubuntu installation erased the D: partition completely it may be best to backup the entire HDD.\nTo do that, you need a external or internal (not the one your D: partition was on) HDD which has enough free space and a Ubuntu Live CD. Everything you have to do is described here: http://www.howtogeek.com/howto/19446/make-a-drive-image-using-an-ubuntu-live-cd/\nAfter that you can relax because you have now an image of your HDD to work with and no more files are lost from now on.\nThere are now two ways I know to rescue your music:\nddrescue (free, linux, command line, all file names are lost): http://www.gnu.org/software/ddrescue/manual/ddrescue_manual.html\nIf your D: drive happened to be an NTFS drive I strongly recommend that you use Get Data Back for NTFS for Windows - it's not free to get but it worked like a charm for me, with folders and file names recovered): http://www.runtime.org/data-recovery-software.htm\n(I'm not sure if NTFS Recovery works with DD Images but you could let it work with your overwritten partition too)\nIF you're D: partition is totally overwritten by Ubuntu,I think you have to recreate the overwritten partition table in order to rescue your files. you can try that with Testdisk (it's also free and on the Knoppix recovery CD): http://www.cgsecurity.org/wiki/TestDisk_Step_By_Step\n", "Q: How to create a bookmark under \"computer\" in the Sidebar of the nautilus file manager in 12.04? Somehow, I removed the Downloads bookmark in the Sidebar under \"Computer\". Is there any way I can make a new one? Possibly with the same icon? I still have my Downloads directory. I just don't have the bookmark under \"Computer\" anymore, and it has the ordinary folder icon. I know it's not the most significant question, but it's a question nonetheless. Also, I'm not sure, but it may be important to note that I'm using unity 2d.\n\n\nA: Enter the directory you want to bookmark and go to Bookmarks → Add bookmark or just press Ctrl+D.\n\nA: You need to do a couple of things then a log out/in should restore. (may be another way but this should suffice\nFirst restore your current Downloads folder's icon\nOpen your home folder & right click on the Downloads folder > properties. Click on the folder icon, this will bring up a select custom icon window.\nBrowse to File System > usr > share > icons > Humanity > places > 48 & select the 1st folder_downloads.svg This should restore the icon to your Downloads folder\nNow back in nautilus window > home folder\nView > Show Hidden Files, open the folder  .config. Inside is a file - user-dirs.dirs\nYou can either edit  or just delete this file. If deleting then after do a log out in & hopefully all will be restored. If you want to edit then look for this line -  XDG_DOWNLOAD_DIR=\"$HOME/\" & edit to this  \nXDG_DOWNLOAD_DIR=\"$HOME/Downloads\"\n\nThen do a log out/in\n\nA: Just drag it there (literally).  It'll make a shortcut / link\nYou can see how I've done this here for various folders.\n\n\nA: My experience has been that you cannot really delete these shortcuts directly.  If you rename the Downloads directory, then the shortcut will automatically rename itself to match the new name, even if you create a new directory named Downloads.  So, how did you delete it?\nDo you have a shortcut with the white down arrow in a folder?  If so, that would be the former Downloads folder, and if you were to rename the actual folder, the shortcut will be renamed.\nIs your current downloads folder named \"Downloads\", exactly?  The first thing I do with a new distro is to delete all those folders (Pictures, Documents, Downloads, Music), and then add back a link to a shared partition, and name the links back to the original names.  It then assumes the special icon automatically.\n", "Q: How can I get Mupen64 and my game saves on 12.04?

In 12.04 I had major nvidia-related problems, so I decided to roll back to 11.10.\nI tried to restore from the backup and at first failed several times with \"an uknown error occured\".  I reformated my hard drive, installed a fresh copy of 11.10 on the hard drive, and tried the restore again, with no success. \nI then booted from a live usb and ran the restore again after mounting the file system. I chose the restore location to be \"file system\" and the restore completed successfully, or so it said.   \nAfter restarting my PC, all I got was a 'no operating system' error. I remounted my partition chrooted and installed the kernel.  \nI am working now but my question concerns the restore. Why didn't the restore worked? \nI'm hoping someone has thought of something that I have not. \n\nA: I know this probably is something that you have thought of but what about reinstalling 11.10 and then restoring your home directory to at least get going? I'm not sure about using Deja Dup as a bare metal restore tool (it might do it, I've just never thought of it that way) so this might be a way to get back to where you want to go.\n\nA: Deja Dup is only intended to back up your home directory files, not system files.  \nReinstall 11.10, use the boot repair CD  (search community for it) to fix boot problems, then restore to home directory with Deja Dup.\n", "Q: Creating a new user after install with encrypted home Just trying to set up a secondary user after install on 12.04.

I need a program compatible with Ubuntu 12.4 LTS that will be able to check my RAM. Also I've tried the memtest86 boot-up program but didn't really understand it, or how it works.\n\nA: There is not much to explain about memtest. Basically it moves patterns through all the memory cells in all possible combinations and therefore puts stress on the RAM.\nThere are only 2 things you need to know:\n\n\n*\n\n*Once you see red lines with error messages in the lower half of the screen you know the RAM is faulty.\n\n*How much sets of tests have been completed (passes).\n\n\n\nUsually if one pass has been completed and you have no error messages the RAM is probably good. There is not much benefit in letting memtest run for over a day. If your system is already heated up, then 1 to 3 passes are enough to know if the RAM is fine or faulty. The technical details show a lot of information that could be related to RAM issues like overclocking for example or a chipset that is beeing known to cause memory issues. \nFor basic usage and analysis it boils down to:\n\n\n*\n\n*Test normal configuration.\n\n*Are there any errors?\n\n\n*\n\n*Test every module independently by removing all but one RAM module.\n\n*Are there any errors? Remove the faulty ones and test the full configuration without the faulty ones.\n\n\n\nNote: There are kernel modules like Badram available, that detect bad memory cells and prevent the operating system from using them, but those are meant to be used for servers if I recall correctly and the best solution is still to replace the faulty RAM modules.\nWhat RAM does not like is overclocking and heat.\n", "Q: Weird port 9000 service, how do I find out what it is? root@server:~# sudo netstat -tlnp\nActive Internet connections (only servers)\nProto Recv-Q Send-Q Local Address           Foreign Address         State       PID/Program name\ntcp        0      0 0.0.0.0:8080            0.0.0.0:*               LISTEN      1548/nginx\ntcp        0      0 0.0.0.0:80              0.0.0.0:*               LISTEN      1370/varnishd\ntcp        0      0 0.0.0.0:22              0.0.0.0:*               LISTEN      1235/sshd\ntcp        0      0 127.0.0.1:25            0.0.0.0:*               LISTEN      1421/sendmail: MTA:\ntcp        0      0 127.0.0.1:6082          0.0.0.0:*               LISTEN      1349/varnishd\ntcp        0      0 127.0.0.1:9000          0.0.0.0:*               LISTEN      1301/main.conf)\ntcp        0      0 127.0.0.1:3306          0.0.0.0:*               LISTEN      1226/mysqld\ntcp        0      0 127.0.0.1:587           0.0.0.0:*               LISTEN      1421/sendmail: MTA:\ntcp        0      0 127.0.0.1:11211         0.0.0.0:*               LISTEN      1263/memcached\ntcp6       0      0 :::8080                 :::*                    LISTEN      1548/nginx\ntcp6       0      0 :::80                   :::*                    LISTEN      1370/varnishd\ntcp6       0      0 :::22                   :::*                    LISTEN      1235/sshd\ntcp6       0      0 ::1:6082                :::*                    LISTEN      1349/varnishd\n\nIt closes with \"main.conf)\" I am a newbe so obviously screwed up somewhere in the configuration file, just not sure it was.

I trying to work out how long can my graphics card last with its fan off without overheating.\nwhen I'm browsing the Internet, the graphics card fan is the loudest thing in my computer. \nSo my question is, how do I monitor the GPU temperature of my ATI Radeon HD 4850 graphics card.\n\nA: Not long until it fries. Depending on the amount of graphic workload you're doing, manufacturing process, accumulated dust could be minutes, hours. buy an aftermarket fanless cooling replacement if  noise is a problem.\nTo monitor your GPU Temperature, use this Q&A to help find the GPU sensor:\nHow to use lm-sensors?\n\nA: Firstly, (See http://www.unixmen.com/howto-install-ati-display-driver-in-ubuntu/ to install) then type \nsudo aticonfig --initial\n\nThen\naticonfig --odgt\n\nOUT:\nDefault Adapter - ATI Radeon HD 5700 Series\n                  Sensor 0: Temperature - 45.00 C\n\n\nA: If you are using the proprietary driver (fglrx), then the command you want is aticonfig --odgt.\nSo far as I'm aware, for many cards this sensor will not be exposed through lm-sensors.\n\nA: sudo apt-get install lm-sensors\nsensors\n\nWhich outputs something like:\nradeon-pci-0100\nAdapter: PCI adapter\ntemp1:   +48.5°C  (crit = +120.0°C, hyst = +90.0°C)\n\n\nA: Since proprietary drivers are not supported anymore, I chose hardware solution. I took ventilator with standard power connector for atx case and taped it over the card. Suppose it's not good for gaming and cryptomining but works well for me.\n\nA: Do modprobe it87 and if you are lucky, lm-sensors will give you the info.\nIf the card runs really hot, you can try to reduce its performance (if the drm module allows that):\necho low > /sys/class/drm/card0/device/power_profile\n\n\nA: Sadly, the HD 4xxx series does not have particularly good power saving features in the Open Source driver today, let alone when this question was written.\nUnless the card was designed to run with the fan off, it will not be able to run at all without it.  Additionally, most AMD cards contain firmware that regulates the fan.  I would not recommend forcing off the fan, but instead simply relying on the card's internal firmware to regulate the fan speed.  \nTo reduce the fan speed, you would need to simply reduce heat production.  I would recommend reading up on the latest power save options to force the card to remain at minimal clock speed.  This will give you decreased heat production at the cost of decreased performance.\n\nA: I have solved this using bash script which sets fan speed to actual temp. I mean if chip temp is 60deg fan speed id 60%. Then I run this under root cron every minute. I created /bin/atiSpeedCron file with this content:\n#!/bin/bash\nread temp < <(/usr/bin/aticonfig --od-gettemperature | grep \"Sensor 0\" | cut -c43-47)\necho temp: $temp\naticonfig --pplib-cmd \"set fanspeed 0 $temp\"\n\nthen I updated cron using \ncrontab -e\n\nunder root account I entered this line:\n* * * * * /bin/atiSpeedCron\n\nthis made me forget about ati fans. btw/ I think grivers should do it.\n", "Q: Headphone jack not working?

Suddenly it stopped working. Something weird happened without any changes or installation or whatsoever. I read that someone had to use alsamixer to activate it: lo and behold: I tinkered with the volumes and mutings and suddenly it started working again as before!!!  I have no explanation, honestly.\n\nA: I just recently upgraded to Ubuntu 20.04(KDE) and faced the same issue. None of the answers gave a permanent fix. The closest fix was by Pepe Lebuntu.\nalsactl restore\nHowever I had to do this everytime I replugged my headphones which became annoying. So I made an acpi event which triggers this command when headphones are plugged.\nTo do so create a file in the directory /etc/acpi/events \ncd /etc/acpi/events\nsudo nano headphone-fix\n\nAnd add the following lines in the file\nevent=jack/headphone HEADPHONE plug\naction=alsactl restore\n\nSave and exit then restart the acpi service using\nsudo service acpid restart\nReplug your headphones and it should now be working everytime you plug it back\n\nA: The solution in a comment above by buzypy worked for me, without any of the other stuff:\nsudo alsa force-reload\n\nthen reopen pavucontrol and change to the option Headphones (unplugged) and restart the program that was playing the sound.\nIt's problems like this that make people not want to use Ubuntu!\n\nA: In my case, for a Dell E5450, it was resolved after runnning:\nsudo modprobe snd-hda-codec-idt\n\n\nA: To day I got it in easy way:\nHow to using headphone in Ubuntu:\n\n\n*\n\n*Install update for Ubuntu.  \n\n*Install GNOME alsa mixer. \n\n*Plug in both of back speakers and front headphone.  \n\n*In ALSA: mute your front column, unmute in Headphone.    \n\n*Go to Sound setting: unmute your sound that was made by ALSA.  \n\n*Click the Test Sound button to go to Test Sound in Sound settings, check left and right ==> ONLY HEADPHONE has sound, Speaker will be silent. \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nA: None of the previous answers posted fixed my issue on Ubuntu 18.04 LTS nor on 16.04 LTS. My computer uses a Clevo motherboard and luckily a developer known as Unrud created an easy fix called \"init-headphone\", which for the Ubuntu distro it is called \"init-headphone-ubuntu\". Basically, you just install the \".deb\" package for Ubuntu and that's it, with no restart required (at least this was true for me). \nTo be clear, at this time, Unrud did not specifically create an 18.04 package, so I used Unrud's 16.04 (Xenial) package on 18.04 and it worked like a charm!\n\nA: During boot, I was passing the parameter acpi=off (see Booting Ubuntu with \"acpi=off\" grub parameter).\nAfter removing acpi=off, the headphones worked again.\n\nA: Out of the box, sound was available via the headphone jack, into which I plugged either headphones or computer speakers.\nThen I ran\n$ pulseaudio\n\nThat disable audio to the headphone jack and enabled sound coming through the monitor (connected via HDMI).\n$ pactl exit\n\nturned off pulseaudio, disabling the monitor sound and re-enabling the jack.\n(I wish things like this were clear from the man pages or whatever.)\n", "Q: upgraded - now network not connected Recent convert to Ubuntu after teaching Comp Sci using windows.

I would cd into /var/lib/logrotate//logrotate and see if I could manually create the \"status\" file(assuming it doesn't exist there already) with the command: touch status . Maybe there's no disk space left for that directory? Check with df -h /var/lib/logrotate/ , or maybe it's set to be immutable (dunno why this would be).\n\nA: You can refer to the following blog link for a detailed discussion: http://teklimbu.wordpress.com/2007/10/16/managing-your-linuxunix-log-files-using-logrotate/\nA quick and dirty trick would be to touch or create an empty file /var/lib/logrotate/status on your server.\nJust a brief background:\nlogrotate is a utility which can rotate log files and archive them in a specified location.\ncron is a service which can be used to schedule to run/automate specific tasks.\nNow, apparently, since cron on the server is scheduled to run the logrotate script daily, which in turn expects the status file to be present (which doesn't exist), your server is throwing these error messages.\nHope it helps.\n", "Q: jdk7 post installation help I was installing JDK7 on Ubuntu 12.04 by following the guide posted on web8.

A clean install may be a quick and dirty way out but that's probably what I would do. The tweaks you have done may well be what is causing the problems. Usually, problems are caused by old non-standard configuration files in your system. Try opening a new clean user account. If this show no problems, your config settings are the problem. If you want to try cleaning things up, you can try some of these - but backup everything first:\nsudo apt-get clean \nsudo apt-get autoremove\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get upgrade\nsudo apt-get -f install\n\nAnd:\nsudo apt-get install ubuntu-desktop^\n\nnot forgetting the caret.\n", "Q: Presario v2136 AP: Which Ubuntu OS Version?

I am unsure of the OS version to opt for.  \nPlease help.  \nThanks,\nAstik\n\nA: I'd suggest the lightest version, Lubuntu.\n12.04 because there is no big difference in performance between 10.04 and recent versions but you'll getting a lot of great things with latest software and kernel version.\nAt first I also suggested Xubuntu but then I saw this comparison, according to it Lubuntu will work better on laptop with such amount of RAM. \n\nA: Well the latest version (12.04 Desktop) requires 384 MB of memory so I wouldn't advice you in using that, but you can use (12.04 Server) it requires only 128 MB of memory so go for it.\nAlternatively if you don't want to use the Ubuntu then Xubuntu is always there for an option.

Right now I am downloading a torrent of size 5.08 GB, but the program detects it as 5.45 GB.\nWhat may cause that kind of problem and how do I check whether files downloaded correctly?\n\nA: Are you sure the unit is the same? Maybe Transmissions is not using GiB units?\n\nIt happens, that 5.45 GB = 5.08 GiB <--- Note the \"i\".\nThe difference between GB (gigabytes) and GiB (gibibytes) is that GB are based on power of 10, and GiB are based on power of 2.\n1 GB  = 1000 MB\n1 GiB = 1024 MiB\n\nand, subsequently \n1 MB  = 1000 kB\n1 MiB = 1024 kiB\n\nGiB is not a SI unit, though SI standard recommends to use it for data size. There is a short article http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gibibyte and there is a detailed explanation of this idea: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary_prefix\nNote that 5.45 GB = 5450000000 B = 5.08 GiB, so if Transmission uses GB instead of GiB, then everything is okay ;)\n", "Q: Ubuntu based OS won't boot I have tried installing Lubuntu, Xubuntu, Kubuntu, and Linux Mint and after the install process is done they never boot up.

Totem, EOG, have dark toolbars for some reason:\n\nwhile other regular GTK3 applications have expected toolbar:\n\nThis doesn't look like preferred way, so why is it like this and how can I set all GTK3 applications to use uniform toolbars?\n\nA: Take a look into /usr/share/themes/Adwaita/gtk-3.0/ folder, there is a file gtk-dark.css. I have no idea why it is there, because I didn't installed the Adwaita dark theme. Also the Advanced Settings menu is showing me only the Adwaita theme, not possible to choose a dark one. So it seems that it isn't installed. From my point of view, this file makes no sense. But instead of deleting it, move it to gtk-dark.css.bak and reload the shell. This will fix the look of EOG, Totem and also Gnome MPlayer.\n\nA: That is for the applications which deals with pictures and videos to maximize the contrast between the application body and the media inside.\nIt's recommended to make the whole them to dark if you want a singleton theme. You can set this via gnome tweak tool!\n\nA: That's how the GNOME project made the theme since 3.2 and above. It does that to Movie Player, Image Viewer, Boxes and other apps.

After I've installed Clementine and imported (for the first time) my complete music library it seems to be impossible to add more songs.\nI can however effortlessly add songs to a playlist - but not to the big library.\nWhat am I doing wrong?\n\nA: Open the preferences dialog box through tools menu.\n \nClick on \"Music Library\" in sidebar of preferences dialog box.\n\nHare you can add more folders to your music library. Clementine will scan these folders on every startup for new songs and will add them automatically to your music library.\n\nA: *\n\n*OK, after much struggle I know the answer to this. The problem is that imagine that one downloads an album from a source which you would prefer to have organised in your music folder.\n\n*Move the album(s) to a convenient folder and then go to preferences and add this folder temporarily to your sources - preferences - music library - add new folder.\n\n*After this you can check that Clementine sees the new album by going to show - added today.\n\n*Now add these new albums to a playlist and select all. Right click and go to organise files.\n\n*This will give you a way to organise the files into your original music folder giving you the (default) option to delete the originals. (By the way this is the way to copy files to another folder remembering NOT to delete the originals). \n\n*In this case you do not wish to keep the originals and yet if you do keep them you will notice that after the organise you have two copies of each song - one in each location.\n\n*Now if you manually go back to your temporary folder you can delete them and Clementine will automatically update the library to having only the one copy.\n\n\nThere you go finished, now you can add the songs back into a playlist so that you can edit the information, I like to check that the genre is correct etc. hope this helps\n", "Q: No sound in Ubuntu except at log in I installed Ubuntu 12.04 a month ago and am using it till now.

Also, it is not required to have a special type for partitions (you can make them logical or primary however you want; the number of primary partitions is restricted to, I think, 4). \nYou can read here about strategies on how to create your multidisk system. \n\nA: You might want to consider just letting the live-DVD follow the defaults unless you have a special reason for wanting home and root on separate partitions.

Unity dash, launcher and notifications goes green after a short moment after login.\nThat happened here:\n\nI use the fglrx driver on my ATI Mobility Radeon HD 4200 series graphics card. \nDoes anybody know how to fix that?\n\nA: Unity has an effect, known as 'chameleon effect'\nAccording to this answer: How do I disable the chameleon effect in notifications and the Unity launcher? there isn't an easy way to turn off this effect.\nSpecifically, Unity takes similar color to your desktop background.\n\nA: In Ubuntu 11.10 it can be done with an application called MyUnity.\nIn Ubuntu 12.04, though, the only way I know to disable this beheaviour is to switch to Unity 2D, and use this (alpha-stage) application to choose a static colour you like.\nTo run this application you will need mono-runtime. To change the background colours, you need to run the application as root. Other settings you change while running as root will not apply to the current user though, which is a bug. In case things get messy, it always leave a backup of system files that where changed by the application.\n\nI am the maker of the application I referenced to, so if you find any bugs (likely you will), feel free to report them to me (preferably on the Launchpad page, so I can keep track of things).\n", "Q: Open Custom Dialog Windows (PyGTK + Quickly) I have just downloaded Quickly, created a new project, set up simple GUI and created new dialog (quickly add dialog create (as you can see, I called it create)).

You need to boot from the shutdown computer and not into Windows.  Once Windows is running, you cannot use the DVD except to run wubi and that will do a kind of install which you don't want.\n\nA: Do you have a spare USB key around? you may just want to make a USB boot disk... \nHere's how:\nhttp://www.ubuntu.com/download/help/create-a-usb-stick-on-windows\nThis is a good first step as you can determine quickly if your hardware will work with Ubuntu. \nHaving made the leap a few years ago (I did the WUBI thing first), I would say that installing Ubuntu side by side with Ubuntu w/o doing WUBI is very safe and very easy to undo if you want to. The Ubuntu installer makes this process be very easy.\n\nA: When burning an ubuntu CD/DVD, you have to use a special mode to burn the .iso image, or it won't be bootable.

This will be a manual restart but from then on your system should restart normally again.\nHope this helps anyone with the same annoying problem.\n\nA: \nNote: Originally Posted by MrCorleone87 on this forum.\n\nOK guys I think I might have a solution to your problems because I had the same problem on numerous distros when using NVIDIA (or ATI) drivers and it took me about 6 months to figure out what causes the problem. The freeze on reboot/shutdown doesn't happen with the Nouveau drivers but those are still not good enough to me. Although they're getting better.\nSo anyway, it is the boot splash that causes the problem. What you have to do is open your file manager as root. For those who don't know how to do it, you open the terminal and type sudo nautilus or su - c nautilus. Nautilus is obviously just an example , so if you're using thunar or pcmanfm you type in su -c thunar etc etc.\nNow, you go to etc/default/grub and you look for the line:\nGRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT=\"quiet splash\"\n\nand you change it to:\nGRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT=\"quiet\"\n\nThen you look for the line:\n#GRUB_GFXMODE=640x480\n\nand you uncomment it and change the resolution to the actual resolution of your screen. (Mine is 1366x76)\nOnce you do that, you add an additional line right under and it goes like this:\nGRUB_GFXPAYLOAD_LINUX=1366x768\n\nSo when you're done , everything should look like this:\nGRUB_GFXMODE=1366x768\nGRUB_GFXPAYLOAD_LINUX=1366x768\n\nNow you save it, open a new terminal window and type in sudo update-grub. You reboot and that's it.\nObviously you won't have plymouth anymore but console output instead. However I think it's definitely worth it and I rather have working NVIDIA (or ATI) drivers without splash screen than the other way around. This solution works for me and it works for all the Ubuntu based distros. I hope it will work for you guys and let me know if it did. This was really bothering me for a long time \n\nA: I had the same problem with my Dell Vostro 1500 and disabled the NVIDIA driver and it is working again!\nGo to \"Additional Drivers\" and see if the NVIDIA driver is activated, if so click remove to deactivate it. \n", "Q: Can not change display resolution on a Sony VGN-FZ21M My Sony Notebook VGN-FZ21M does have a NVIDIA grafic card with a VESA G86 Board - e415h01.

I had Ubuntu 11.10 installed on my hard disk with Windows 7 in a multi-boot arrangement. If I wanted to make a backup copy of the entire disk, I used Clonezilla, and it worked fine. If there was a problem with Windows or Ubuntu, I simply restored them both by using the Clonezilla backup copy of the entire hard disk.\nA few days ago, I upgraded to Ubuntu 12.04. I now had a hard disk with Windows 7 and Ubuntu 12.04 in the same kind of multi-boot arrangement as before. However, every time I tried to make the same kind of backup copy as before, Clonezilla reported \"Something went wrong.\" I tried this several times, and the same thing happened.\nI reinstalled Windows 7 alone, and Clonezilla works fine. But as soon as I install Ubuntu 12.04 alongside it on the hard disk, and try to make a backup copy with Clonezilla, I get the same report, \"Something went wrong.\"\nI have reinstalled Windows 7 alone so that at least I can make a backup copy of Windows 7, if there's a problem, but I'd also like to have Ubuntu 12.04 installed alongside it on the same hard disk. I don't dare do that, though, because it would be impossible to make a backup copy.\nIf Clonezilla no longer works with Ubuntu in a multi-boot arrangement, can anyone suggest imaging software that would allow me to make a backup copy of my hard disk, the way I could with a Windows 7 and Ubuntu 11.04 multi-boot?\n\nA: The problem has been resolved. I erased the partition with Ubuntu 12.04 and downloaded and installed it again. This time, however, during the installation process, when I was given the choice of retaining the configuration of elements that had been installed before or reinstalling them with an upgraded configuration, I chose the latter in every case. Now Clonezilla works flawlessly. It makes a complete image of my hard disk, and it is possible to boot from either Windows 7 or Ubuntu 12.04. No more \"something went wrong\" messages.\n\nA: You can make an image of your system with several other applications such as \"Paragon Hard Disc Manager\", \"Paragon Rescue Kit\", \"Easus Partition \"Master\", \"Acronis True Image\", \"Macrium Reflect\" to name but a few. I have copies of these which these companies have given away free at some point or other, and they each have been useful in their own way. If you search for them on the Internet you will probably find one of them available as a free download for a limited time. They are Windows applications, but you run them and choose to make a 'rescue disc'. This disc is bootable, and will allow the kinds of image copying you refer to, even if Windows fails, and/or Ubuntu fails. In my case I have Windows, Ubuntu 11.10, and Ubuntu 12.04 on the same hard disc and have used one to rescue the other several times. Sometimes these applications will copy one partition and then fail on the next, so it is better to copy one partition at a time, rather than the whole disc. The failures are frequently due to disc errors, and these can be corrected usually by running a file system check. Good Luck.\n", "Q: Can Twitter monitor my browsing activities when using a client like Hotot or Gwibber?

One possible workaround, that might also work in your case, is to install a Thunderbird extension like FireTrayR or similar.\n\nA: Your message icon won't show up when you get a new email unless you open Thunderbird.

Upon installation I have to connect with wired connection and uninstall the broadcom sta drivers and install the b43-fwcutter package instead.  You also need the firmware-b43-installer package.  It is possible to download the packages and dependencies and  install them manually, but I have had much better luck installing with through the wired adapter.\n", "Q: Did I do something wrong while trying to recover files with foremost?

When I click the install button nothing happens at all. No error, just doesn't work. I originally had these issues but the solution listed there worked for me. Installing packages from the command line with apt-get and dpkg works. I also tried following the advice in this thread but to no avail.\nEdit: Running from the command line I get no messages when I try and click the install button but get a warning when it's started:\n2012-05-06 12:14:04,481 - softwarecenter.ui.gtk3.app - INFO - setting up proxy 'None'\n2012-05-06 12:14:04,536 - softwarecenter.db.database - INFO - open() database: path=None use_axi=True use_agent=True\n2012-05-06 12:14:04,988 - softwarecenter.backend.reviews - WARNING - Could not get usefulness from server, no username in config file\n\nEdit 2: Seems I slightly stupid and just realized that it's disabled out (guess I'm not used to the Ubuntu GUI yet). Realizing this I googled and found this workaround, but still does anyone know of a solution?\n\nA: Since the install button won't work, instead select the software you want to install by clicking on File on the top menu, and click \"Install\", and see if it will work.\n\nA: For me this was solved by doing\nsudo software-center\n\nin the terminal, essentially just starting it with the \"right\" privileges.

Unfortunately I don't wrote down all packages which get no longer updates from canonical like defoma. So I wonder how I could detect all such packages and remove them?\nComing from Debian a command-line solution is preferred, but a GUI solution is acceptable.\n\nA: Every package that is in main  and restricted appears to be supported, everything else not.\nThere are some aptitude query examples available; for a ppa-less install this should yield the currently supported list:\naptitude search \"?not(?section(universe)) ?not(?section(multiverse)) ?installed\"\nHowever the easiest is to use synaptic, select installed and click on the column with the ubuntu icon. All the installed packages that no longer have this icon are not supported. You can also add a custom filter to synaptic that will achieve your goal.\n", "Q: How to uninstall VMware Player 4.0.3 on 12.04? I installed VMware Player 4.0.3 on Ubuntu 12.04. When I try to run an image, I get errors such as \"/usr/lib/vmware/settings\": No such file or directory. or \"~/.vmware/config\": No such file or directory..\nI tried patching it but I get unable to install vmnet message from the patch, thus I would like to uninstall the Player and re-install it.\nThe install file was a bash script downloaded from vmware, not a package, it doesn't appear in dpkg. SO, how do you uninstall VMware Player 4.0.3?\n\nA: Use the switch: --uninstall-component=vmware-player\nThat uninstalled it for me.\n\nA: Since I noticed the answer is not contained in this thread,  I figured I would go ahead and add it for those looking for it:\nAnswers were close -- the command is the following:\nsudo sh VMware-Player-4.0.3-703057.x86_64.bundle --uninstall-component=vmware-player\n\nThough this is probably obvious, update the name to reflect the installation package name you're using. \n\nA: All you gotta do is goto usr/lib/vmware-installer/2.0 run script vmware-uninstall-downgrade. then run script vmware-installer and read it will give you directions and options :)\n\nA: Poking through the install script, it looks like running the installer again should give you the option to remove it.\nHowever, in a similar question, someone has recommended:\ngksudo vmware-installer -u vmware-player. (See How can I uninstall VMware-Player?)\nFailing that, there should be an entry somewhere in /etc, possibly in /etc/bin/vm-something, /etc/locations (if it exists) or /etc/vmware-something.\nThis is all I can gather from the installer.\n", "Q: tomcat and apache http together can I install apache tomcat 6 and apache http web server on the same machine (Ubuntu 11.10) without problems ?\ntomcat to serve GeoServer\napache web serve to serve static files\n\nA: Yes, you can.

On Windows, my laptop's wireless card had the ability to share its own internet by  Wi-Fi Direct. I could connect by laptop to other devices via Intel's My Wi-Fi program, which I believe uses Wi-Fi Direct, and then share my internet to them. Is there any way to do this in Ubuntu?\nMy laptop model: Samsung NP300E5A.\nMy wireless card: Intel Corporation Centrino Wireless-N 130.\nThanks!\nEDIT: I am using Ubuntu 12.04. Also, I am not trying to share my ethernet connection. I am trying to share my wireless connection to other Wi-Fi devices. See here.\n\nA: Seems like you have misunderstood WiFi Direct use case. WiFi Direct is not about sharing the connection (as you wrote it), but a peer-to-peer communication without involving AP.\nThe sad truth is that you cannot mix WiFi Direct with Station mode, which so far makes the whole idea of using WiFi Direct pretty useless. At least I'm not aware about any solution that is capable of doing that.\nMy advise to you - wait at least couple of years until this technology will be widely supported. Currently, since this technology is primarily driven by Sony, WiFi Direct is already present in their TV's, so you can stream videos/photos to Sony TV directly from your WiFi Direct supported device. Excerpt from the same link:\n\nSometimes your friends want to share their personal photos and videos on your beautiful HDTV. With Sony's Wi-Fi Direct™ Mode, your friends can throw personal content to your TV without connecting to your home network. Wi-Fi Direct completely bypasses the Wi-Fi access point/router, so it’s easy to set up.\n\nBy the way, latest Android version supports WiFi Direct as well, Galaxy Nexus has it.\n\nA: This is well documentated in Ubuntu Community Help Wiki.\nBecause is a large text, i send the link:\n WifiDocs/ShareEthernetConnectionThroughWireless\nGood luck.\n\nA: This link contains all the help you need, it solved this same issue for me too >> http://mydailyhash.wordpress.com/2010/07/16/internet-connection-sharing-on-ubuntu-windows-with-ad-hoc-2/\n\nA: As @Andrejs Cainikovs says the technology is not wi-fi direct. \nSo reading your question and answer, let me rephrase your question.\nYou are connected to internet via wi-fi and want to share it over the same device by creating some  access point. Am I right?\nIf so, I am afraid at the time of writing this case is not possible in any other OS other than windows 7 (may be the list will include win8).\nWindows 7 has internal support to create a wlan hosted network. In windows if you open  the network and internet → Network Connections, you can see with your actual wlan device there are one or two extra device described as Microsoft virtual wi-fi miniport like below.\n\nThis is virtualization of physical adapter. Read more about it here.\nTo achieve this requirement you need to by a wireless device/wireless repeater. :)\nSmiler Question : - \nhttps://superuser.com/questions/233924/share-a-wifi-connection-through-wifi-on-mac-os-x\n", "Q: I cannot use hibernate/sleep in Ubuntu 12.04 \nPossible Duplicate:\nHow to enable hibernation in 12.04? \n\nI have 3.9 gb of RAM,261 gb of HDD, and 3.9 gb of swap (Toshiba laptop).

Because from what I have read (the Data Recovery page of Ubuntu), it says that you need one.\n\nA: Sure you can, but since it works by reading a raw partition, you cannot use it to recover files from a mounted filesystem. That means that if you're trying to recover data from an external storage medium or an unmounted partition, it'll work. On the other hand, if you try to recover data from a mounted partition (e.g. one that is part of your running Ubuntu installation), you won't be able to reliable do so.\nThat brings you to a Live environment: all partitions are unmounted and you can safely perform read operations on a partition and write it to an external storage device.\n", "Q: How do I compile the latest gvim from source I have found that I need to compile the lastest gvim due to a bug I have reported, but how do I proceed?\n\nA: Run the following commands in the terminal.\nsudo apt-get build-dep vim-gnome\n\nto get all the build dependencies you need.\nThen\nsudo apt-get install mercurial\n\nto get the Mercurial version control system needed to download the latest Vim source code.\nThen\nhg clone https://vim.googlecode.com/hg/ vim\n\nto download the Vim source code to the subdirectory vim of the current directory.\ncd vim/src\n\nto change to the right directory\nNow let's configure Vim for compilation (with \"huge\" features - see http://www.drchip.org/astronaut/vim/vimfeat.html for a description of the different feature sets)\n./configure --prefix=/usr/local --with-features=huge\n\nIf ./configure finished without any problems, then run\nmake\n\nand then\nsudo make install\n\nand that should be it.\nTo update Vim to the latest version, just go into the vim directory and run\nhg pull\nhg update\n\nand then re-run configure, make and make install.\n", "Q: Video Lens Only Displays up to 100 Local Videos The video lens only displays 100 of 'My Videos', even though I have hundreds more.\nIf I add more to the folder, that gets displayed, but others are removed.\nIs there any way to increase the limit, to display them all?\nI really would love to use this feature, but I would require it to index my entire video folder for me to browse using this lens.\n\nA: The video lens is coded to display a maximum of 100 results in its searches of local files.  If there is no search terms entered, then it will display the first 100 local videos it finds.  With search terms, it will display the first 100 videos matching the search terms that it finds.\nThe maximum limit is there for reasons of performance.  It is also more difficult for users to find what they are looking for  large numbers of results rather than try to reduce the number of results by using more specific search terms.\nThat being said, to increase the maximum number of results being displayed:\n\n\n*\n\n*In a terminal, enter the following to edit the source code of the video lens:\nsudo gedit /usr/lib/unity-lens-video/unity-lens-video\n\nYou will need to enter your password to edit this file.\n\n*In the file, find line 220:\nif video_counter < 100:\n\n(or press CTRL+F and search for 100)\n\n*Change 100 to a larger number ( e.g. 500) and save the file\n\n*Log out and log back in again.

On my laptop, I have a faulty headphone socket, so when I insert headphones into it, the speakers do not mute. I can confirm that this problem is caused by faulty hardware and not software as when I twist the headphone jack, the speakers come on and off according to the movements.\nOn previous versions of Ubuntu, I worked around this problem by going into alsamixer and disabling \"Auto-Mute Mode\", and then going into the sound settings and choosing \"Analog Headphones\". However, on 12.04, no such option exists, rendering my headphones unusable with no way to work around the problem.\nI momentarily thought I had this problem fixed when I installed PulseAudio Volume Control from the Software Centre. I selected the Output Devices tab, and under \"Built-in Audio Analogue Stereo\" I selected \"Headphones\" for the port. However, this almost randomly seems to change back to \"Speakers\", despite me setting \"Auto-Mute Mode\" as disabled.\nBasically, I would like a way to permanently mute the speakers so only the headphones will play sound, without it losing my settings. It is ridiculous that such a simple setting has been taken away to \"simplify\" the user interface.\n\nA: This is what I did to stop the sound from being played from my built in speakers even when the headphones are connected.\n\n\n*\n\n*Goto \"Ubuntu Software Centre\", search for \"GNOME ALSA Mixer\" and install it.\n\n*Reboot the machine if required.\n\n*Open \"GNOME ALSA Mixer\". Check the 'Mute' below the column named \"Mono\". Uncheck the mute under other columns.\n\n*Yippee ! You should now hear sound only from the headphones and not from the built in speakers.\n\n\nPlease try this and let me know if it works for you. This is for Ubuntu 12.04 LTS.\nIn case you don't see the column named \"Mono\", just try this out. In the GNOME ALSA Mixer, check active the headphone Jack Sense tab below the volume control options. This solved the problem for me.\n\nA: Open sound from preferences app. Click on output tab, and then choose the right output. \nIf this doesn't work, install PulseAudio. It will allow you to have control over were sound is transferred from your machine.

Recently i install vmware 4.1 (which is bundle file). Now i want to remove it. How to do that?\n\nA: If you want to remove VMware completely, you can try this (First make sure the .bundle file is executable.)\n./VMware.bundle -u\"vmware-workstation\"\n\nFor making a file executable :\n chmod +x /path/to/the/file\n\nAnd, even without that - and from any directory (in modern times) you can run:\n sudo vmware-installer -u vmware-workstation\n\nAnd that will uninstall it.\n\nA: VMware comes with a shell script named as .bundle. With this script all applications bundled with VMware will be installed. Unless a package manager is called from this script (which isn't) it will be done without the help of a package manager. Therefore our package managers can not help uninstalling the software.\nHowever the installer that comes with VMware (vmware-installer) should have an option to uninstall components:\nvmware-installer -h\n\nTo display all options you have with this program. Whether this will work, and if really all packages can be removed by this I don't know.\nAn example of how to remove the vmware-player is given at the Ubuntu Community Wiki:\nsudo vmware-installer -u vmware-player\n\nAlso given there is a long list of things to do for a manual uninstall in case this fails.\n", "Q: League of Legends with VirtualBox Is it possible for me to run League of Legends (LoL) on Windows 7 in VBox? \nMy specs:\nintel i3\n4 gb ram\n512 mb VGA\n\nA: Yes, you can run Win7 on Virtualbox and it is amazing to see it encapsulated by Ubuntu!!!!!

As soon as it appears, press the spacebar to stop the timer. Now examine the Grub boot menu and see if you have a line mentioning Windows. If so, boot into Windows, and then download a little program called, EasyBCD. This is a free program for Windows which allows you to adjust the boot sequence.

Thank you for your reply. I've suggested this to a lot of people and that is to burn a CD of SuperGrub Boot Disc. You boot from that and it will present you with a list of OSs to choose from. Try that next. Following that, what happens if you try to examine the contents of those partitions from a Live CD install?? Are they readable now??\n\nA: I have had this same problem, I have tried most suggestions found here and in other well answered post with no success.\nI kind of found a simpler way of fixing it, and just wanted to share this newfound knowledge with you all, who are as I was trying to solve it in a too complicated way.\nSo, my NTFS storage partition was almost 2 Tb, which is too big for the ext filesystems if I am correct. There is software to actually move a partition, with all its data, to the back of the drive. Thus you can split it, move the stored data, and create a new partition with ext3 or ext4, or your system of choice, in the beginning of the drive. This made Ubuntu directly bootable without hassle.\nI used Minitool Partition Wizard Home edition. And I can assure you, that data is moved, and not wiped. I don't know if gparted moves the data as well?\nBest wishes,\nCarl-Magnus\n", "Q: Speakers not working properly on HP Elitebook 8440p Since the 11.10 I have this problem: when I start my notebook, Speakers do not work, Whereas headphones do.\nAfter standby and resume, Usually but not always, Everything works well.\nAny idea how to solve this issue?\nMy Notebook specs:\n\nUbuntu 12.04 LTS 64bit (fresh installation)\nHP Elitebook 8440p\n\nthe output of aplay -l is the following: \nLista di PLAYBACK dispositivi hardware\nscheda 0: Intel [HDA Intel], dispositivo 0: STAC92xx Analog [STAC92xx Analog]\n  Sottoperiferiche: 0/1\n  Sottoperiferica #0: subdevice #0\nscheda 1: NVidia [HDA NVidia], dispositivo 3: HDMI 0 [HDMI 0]\n  Sottoperiferiche: 1/1\n  Sottoperiferica #0: subdevice #0\nscheda 1: NVidia [HDA NVidia], dispositivo 7: HDMI 0 [HDMI 0]\n  Sottoperiferiche: 1/1\n  Sottoperiferica #0: subdevice #0\nscheda 1: NVidia [HDA NVidia], dispositivo 8: HDMI 0 [HDMI 0]\n  Sottoperiferiche: 1/1\n  Sottoperiferica #0: subdevice #0\nscheda 1: NVidia [HDA NVidia], dispositivo 9: HDMI 0 [HDMI 0]\n  Sottoperiferiche: 1/1\n  Sottoperiferica #0: subdevice #0\n\n\nA: Finally I fixed it. \nI followed the instruction of the last post of this thread: \nlink (linked by this other one: link ), \nand I set the last line of alsa-base.conf as follows: \noptions snd-intel-hda model=auto,auto enable_msi=1,0 index=0,1 id=Intel,NVidia \n\nAfter shutdown (simply rebooting does not work, I don't know why) everything seems to work fine..\n", "Q: powernow-k8: Hardware error - pending bit very stuck new install of ubuntu 12.04 on a dual core AMD Turion X2\nOne of the problems while running is that the PC won't awaken from hibernation.\ndmesg shows some errors that I don't understand:\npowernow-k8: Hardware error - pending bit very stuck\n   powernow-k8: transition frequency failed\n   powernow-k8: failing targ, change pending bit set\n   spurios 8259A interrupt: IRQ7.\n   Fast TSC calibration failed\n   Marking TSC unstable due to TSCs unsynchronized\n\nA: Welcome you here!

I've setup Thunderbird (default in 12.04) with five mail accounts. Unfortunatly, every mail address is shown only with its own inbox, sent...\nHow can I get a combined inbox for all addresses? I've searched for extensions, but did not find any that add this feature.\n\nA: Click view, folders then \"unified\"\nThis should sort it for you.\nHope it helps.\n\nA: I believe the feature you are looking for is called 'Unified Folders' which works on both IMAP and POP3 protocols.\nThe official site location: http://kb.mozillazine.org/Global_Inbox#Unified_Folders\nQuote from the site:\n\nUnified Folders (originally named Smart Folders when it was added in\n  3.0) is a folder pane view which looks like a global inbox account by merging the contents of all inbox folders (both POP, IMAP and local\n  folders) from all accounts. It also shows the inbox of each account as\n  a child folder of the unified Inbox account. Any messages in an inbox\n  shows up in both the root of the unified Inbox, plus the child folder\n  of the unified Inbox for that account.\n\nTo use this functionality:\nView >> Folders >> Unified\n\nI have verified that this does work on Thunderbird 12.0.1 using Ubuntu 12.04. The KB article I found above it a bit old but still holds correct information about the functionality of the 'Unified Folders'.\nIf you are just trying to combine the Inbox only and leave the rest as is, it does not look like it can be done but extensions can be made in the future to have this feature in Thunderbird.\nHope this is helpful.\n\nA: I prefer a solution where you have both combined Inbox and Sent folders and the regular folders of each account in your side pane.\nThis is different from the Unified Folders option, where you may end up switching between two different folder views.\nHere is how to set up a combined Inbox folder in addition to the standard view, using a saved search folder:\n\n\n*\n\n*File -> New -> Saved Search\n\n*Set Name \"All Inboxes\" or \"Combined Inbox\" as you wish\n\n*Create as a subfolder of: \"Local Folders\"\n\n*Click \"Choose...\" and mark each Inbox folder from all your different accounts.\n\n*Select \"Match all messages\"\n\n*Create the saved search. You can now find the (saved search) folder \"All Inboxes\" in your Local Folders.\n\n*Repeat the process for \"All Sent\" if you wish or other types of folders. Of course, you can also set up a saved search folder for all starred messages over all accounts or other useful configurations.\nIf you add more email accounts later, right-click on the \"All inboxes\" folder and edit its properties to add the respective folder of a new email account.\nHere is more detailed information on saved search folders: https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/using-saved-searches\nSo I would like to correct ruffEdgz's answer:\n\nIf you are just trying to combine the Inbox only and leave the rest as\n  is, it does not look like it can be done \n\nYes, you can combine your Inboxes using a standard feature of Thunderbird, saved searches, you only need to choose the folders manually and add them when you add new accounts.\nI have been using this since on Ubuntu since 11.10 on various Thunderbird versions and also on other OSes. The only thing I haven't tested is POP email accounts, I always use IMAP.\n\nA: Ok, this is the method I believe the OP may have wanted:\nTools --> Account Settings. Then select the mail account you want to download into Global Inbox. Then select \"Server Settings\" menu branch, then at the very bottom in the \"Message storage\" area, opposite \"empty trash on exit\" is an \"Advanced\" tab, and hey presto!\n", "Q: How do I install the latest stable version of LibreOffice?

Is the bios-grub partition in Ubuntu 12.04 mandatory? \nI have used 11.04, 11.10 and 12.04, But I was never asked for this. \nToday I tried a fresh installation of Ubuntu 12.04 and for the first time I was asked for this Grub partition of minimum 1Mb. I first tried to reinstall 12.04, but the error continued. \nSo I installed Fedora 16, Keeping all partitions as they were (replaced Ubuntu with Fedora), And then did another fresh installation of 12.04.\nIs it ok to continue with this grub partition or is there a fault in my system's hardware? If this is a (hardware) fault, how can I fix it?\nI'm using a Lenovo S10-2 Ideapad. The only OS right now installed is Ubuntu 12.04.\n\nwell, let me answer. It was /usr/bin/xorg issue that I had with firstly installed precise. I used fedora16 basically for removing precise totally (my experience tells me ubuntu can't completely erase and reinstall by itself). this 1mb grub is created by fedora. I then wanted to remove it while reinstalling ubuntu but got caution bootloader may fail. hence I have to keep this 1mb drive. but prior to yesterday, i used both fedora and ubuntu, even same CDs, but had no such partition. my question is if this partition is necessary or not? if not, how can i safely remove it from my system?\nAm using only ubuntu 12.04 -- before and after (now).\n\nA: The GUID Partition Table (GPT) is a way of partitioning disks that's more flexible than the older Master Boot Record (MBR) system. GPT works on bigger disks than MBR (which has a 2 TiB limit, assuming a standard 512-byte sector size) and it has some other minor advantages. When GRUB 2 installs to a GPT disk on a BIOS-based computer, it likes to have a BIOS Boot Partition in place, and this is what Ubuntu's installer means by the \"bios-grub\" partition. This is basically a small partition in which part of GRUB's code resides. It's not needed on MBR-based computers because GRUB 2 uses some officially-unallocated space instead. The GPT method is actually safer, but the MBR method usually works, in practice.\nI suspect that this is what happened:\n\n\n*\n\n*In previous installations, you used GRUB 2 on MBR disks and so had no need of a BIOS Boot Partition.\n\n*When you installed Fedora, it converted a blank disk to GPT format. Fedora 16 is known to do this; it favors GPT even when it's not strictly necessary. (The Fedora developers are reportedly reversing this decision for Fedora 17.)\n\n*When you tried to re-install Ubuntu, it saw the GPT configuration and tried to use it. This involved creating a BIOS Boot Partition, or complaining if one wasn't present.\n\n\nThere's absolutely no harm to using a BIOS Boot Partition. One of GPT's advantages over MBR is that GPT doesn't have a 4-primary-partition limit, so devoting 1 MiB of space to a BIOS Boot Partition doesn't chew up precious partition resources. In fact, using GPT has some minor advantages, such as a lack of distinction between primary, extended, and logical partitions (you can create up to 128 partitions by default) and the use of backup data structures and CRCs to help protect against accidental destruction of your partitions. That said, if you want to dual-boot with Windows, using GPT will prevent installing Windows unless the computer has UEFI, rather than BIOS, firmware. This is a big minus. There are also buggy BIOSes out there that won't boot from GPT disks unless you jump through some extra hoops.\nIf you want to install to an MBR disk, you'll have to remove the GPT data. You can do this with GParted by selecting Device -> Create Partition Table. Be sure that you opt to create an \"msdos\" partition table (what GParted calls MBR). This will wipe the GPT data and convert to MBR. If you have data you want to preserve, you may be able to do a GPT-to-MBR conversion with my gdisk program, but this doesn't always work. Also, converting in this way will render the disk unbootable until you re-install your boot loader.\n\nA: Is the bios-grub partition in Ubuntu 12.04 mandatory?\nOnly if you're using a BIOS based system and partitioned using GPT.\n\nA: bios-grub partition is not mandatory. It's (strongly) recommended as it reserves some disk space for grub files. MBR partitioning scheme specificates some unallocated space at the beginning of the disk, even before partition table starts. That's where grub binary resides in MBR scheme. GTP scheme doesn't specificate that, so it is recommended to create a little unformatted partition for grub to ocuppy. However all linux partitioning tools (like fdisk, gdisk etc) do leave at least 1MB free space before GPT partition table by default. Windows tools might not do that. 1MB is more than enough for standard grub installation.\nThis graphic explains it pretty well: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BIOS_boot_partition#/media/File:GNU_GRUB_components.svg\nSo if you're still in doubt check how much space is left at the beginning of the disk, and if grub binaries (boot.img and core.img) will fit there.\nOr you can simply try installing without bios-grub partition, and if system won't boot reinstall.\n", "Q: Is there any Windows 7 theme that works on 12.04?

Just try to check it if the above tweak works for you. Then just follow the procedures normally as told you in answer 1. \n\nA: Check Maverickz' answer here.\nThe cause of the problem is that the desktop session is not being reported as Gnome.

This question is similar to How can I find out why a package was installed?, but in my case I'd like to know before actually installing a package, why it will install a particular dependency.\nSo for example I might run\nsudo apt-get install superfoo\n\nand the output will say something like:\nThe following extra packages will be installed:\n  foo bar baz ... libderp libjunk\n\nAnd this might be a really huge list. In some instances I'll see something that is going to be installed that doesn't really make sense to me given what I'm installing, so I want to know why that particular dependency is going to be installed.\nIn the above example let's say I'd like to understand why libderp would get installed. I know that somehow there is a chain of dependencies between superfoo and libderp but the huge list of packages to be installed makes it hard to see what this chain is.\nOnce I know the dependency chain, I can decide whether I really want to install the original package or not, and/or whether I should get in touch with the maintainer of that package to see if they really need to have those dependencies there.\n\nA: There may be an easier way to do this, but it can be done if you use reverse-depends. You will need to install the ubuntu-dev-tools package by doing\napt-get install ubuntu-dev-tools\nOr by clicking this button:\n\nOnce installed, you can then use reverse-depends to see what depends on a specific package. For example, if you try to install something that wants to install a bunch of extra packages and you want to see why \"libsmpeg0\" is being installed, you run\nreverse-depends libsmpeg0\n\nWhich would output the following.\nReverse-Recommends\n==================\n* sandboxgamemaker\n\nReverse-Depends\n===============\n* btanks\n* fenix-plugin-mpeg [armel armhf i386 powerpc]\n* fillets-ng\n* gltron [amd64 armel i386 powerpc]\n* libalien-sdl-perl\n* libsdl-perl [i386]\n* libsmpeg-dev\n* libtaoframework-sdl1.2-cil\n* python-pygame\n* ruby-sdl\n* sdlbrt\n* smpeg-gtv\n* smpeg-plaympeg\n* tdfsb\n\nPackages without architectures listed are reverse-dependencies in: amd64, armel, armhf, i386, powerpc\n\nTake a look and see if the package you want to install is in that list. If not, then another one of the packages that is being pulled in during that initial install will show up in that list, and you will need to run reverse-depends on that package. Eventually you will see the initial package you want to install in that list. At that point, you should have a chain showing exactly why that package was installed. \nAs an added note, I believe recommends is on by default, so if something is set as a recommends it will get pulled in to. Suggests if off, but reverse-depends can show that info as well.\n\nA: apt-rdepends does this, without installing 50+ libraries of cruft like ubuntu-dev-tools.\ndurr@scraper:~$ apt-rdepends mercurial\nReading package lists...

It occurs more often when working on battery.\nThe problem seems to arise from incorrect work of pm-utils. But if you write on into /sys/bus/*/devices/*/power/control, the kernel takes control over power management at the specified devices - and somehow this makes the hardware to shut down correctly.\nSo I have written a script:\n#!/bin/bash\n\ncase \"$1\" in\n  stop) for i in /sys/bus/*/devices/*/power/control ; do echo on > $i ; done \n  ;;\nesac\n\nexit 0\n\nand to make it being executed every time before shutdown I've placed it under name K32power-control-on into /etc/rc0.d directory (don't forget to make the script executable, sudo chmod +x K32power-control-on).

After this Ubuntu probably just uses settings which do work.\nI am not sure how you could fix this. What I would try ... and this is just a guess ... is to open System Settings > Displays, click on Detect Displays, and then try changing the resolution.\nHopefully someone else will have a better answer ...\n\n*I can not load Windows!\nIt is hard to suggest a possible solution for this without knowing more about your system, which operating systems are installed, and in what order they were installed and/or became unavailable.\nIt would also help to have the info the utility boot-repair supplies in a \"Bootinfo Summary\". If you would follow the instructions below to create a Bootinfo Summary and then update your question to include the link to the summary, it would help us advise you on how to fix your problem booting windows.\n\n\nHow to use boot-repair to provide a \"Bootinfo Summary\"\n\nSince your can still boot Ubuntu, you directly install and run the Boot-Repair tool and use it to Create a Bootinfo summary.\nFirst, install the Boot-Repair tool using apt-get.

Click on the Create a Bootinfo summary box/button. This will collect information about your system's boot configuration, but will not make any changes.\n\n\n  \n\n*When the bootinfo summary has been created, boot-repair will display a message containing a URL which should look like this: http://paste.ubuntu.com/123456/. \n\nPlease update/edit your question and add this URL. The information in the pastebin this link points to will (I hope) help us diagnose the problem.\n\n\n\nReply to comment @ 2012-05-06 23:18:37Z\n\nAny time there I turn on the PC i see the BIOS configuration, then appear Loading system and 3 seconds later appear the [Signal out of range] message.\nI am not sure I understand. Most of the PCs I am familiar with show BIOS POST messages when they startup/boot. Is the \"BIOS configuration\" which you see now different in some way? Or did you see the same BIOS messages previously when only Windows was installed?\nTry pressing and holding the shift key immediately after you see the Loading system message. This is supposed to make the GRUB boot menu appear. Does it?\n\nA: Your system is having trouble showing Grub and console Linux. This is a grub issue that is currently being worked on.(Actually stalled at the bug tracker) To get into Windows, start up, and a few seconds in, and try pressing ↓(down arrow key) 5 times(I looked at your pastebin entry) and press Enter. Note that this applies to the OP's configuration, so if you have a GRUB configuration different from the OP's, then this may not help you.\nIf this fails, hold shift when it says loading system and try to press down 5 times, followed by enter, hopefully booting Windows. Unfortunately, until you can figure out what order the menu is in, you are groping in the dark. I'd try an ATI video card. Boot-repair will not help but you can try using lilo instead of Grub. \nAlternatively, you could try loading Grub through ntldr so you have a choice for Windows before you get into blind grub, but this is not ideal and should be avoided.

I suppose if I knew how to access the program code I'd be able to do it as I'd just have to put together two options that already exist.\nThanks \n\nA: You can go to the menu:\nOptions → Configure → QuickBuild → User\nand define there (in User) the actions that you want by specifying the command pipeline.\nFor example, I have the following pipeline:\nlatex -interaction=nonstopmode %.tex | bibtex %.aux | bibtex %.aux | bibtex %.aux | \nlatex -interaction=nonstopmode %.tex | latex -interaction=nonstopmode %.tex | \ndvipdf %.dvi | rm %.aux %.bbl %.blg %.dvi %.log %.out %.toc\n\nNote that at the end of the pipe, I removed files specifying them by their extension (.toc, .aux, etc)\nHope it helps.\n\nA: Finally, what worked best for me was to compile TexMaker from source merging the methods to clean and to close. So any time I close a file the auxiliary files are removed.\n", "Q: How to fix \"ndiswrapper not found\"? I've been using ndiswrapper to make work some wireless cards using its Windows drivers, because they are not yet supported by free Linux drivers. Until Ubuntu 12.04.\nNow, I can install Windows Wireless Network Drivers (ndisgtk) from Ubuntu Software Center but when I try to load the driver, I get an error message saying \nFATAL: Module ndiswrapper not found.\n\nI get the same error if I type on a terminal sudo modprobe ndiswrapper.\nHow can I workaround this bug until it's fixed?\n\nA: This bug is reported here. I managed to workaround it so I thought I could share the fix so others can benefit and perhaps contribute more accurate information. Information source is soneedu commnent and Ubuntu Wiki.\n\nUpdate: There is another fix suggestion which seems way more easy to do, and it was confirmed in the comments that it works.\nFix suggestion #1:\n\n\n*\n\n*Install the package ndiswrapper-dkms\n\n*Run the command: sudo modprobe ndiswrapper\nNow you should be able to use the Windows Wireless Network Drivers (ndisgtk) utility.\nDon't forget to make sure that ndiswrapper is being loaded on system startup.\n\nFix suggestion #2:\nTested on Ubuntu 12.04 32 bit.\nGo to Ubuntu Software Center, search for ndisgtk and open its entry. Install it in case you haven't yet. Check the add-on Source for the ndiswrapper Linux kernel module (ndiswrapper-source) and click \"Apply Changes\".\nNow there must be a file called ndiswrapper.tar.bz2 in /usr/src. Open a terminal and go to the directory:\ncd /usr/src\n\nExtract the file:\nsudo tar -xjf ndiswrapper.tar.bz2\n\nGo the the extracted directory:\ncd /usr/src/modules/ndiswrapper\n\nCompile and install:\nsudo make\nsudo make install\n\nAdd the module to the system:\nsudo modprobe ndiswrapper\n\nOpen the file:\ngksudo gedit /etc/modprobe.d/ndiswrapper.conf\n\nDelete the content of the file, save and close. Then let the module write the configuration file again:\nsudo ndiswrapper -m\n\nReboot.\nNow you should be able to use the Windows Wireless Network Drivers (ndisgtk) utility.\nDon't forget to make sure that ndiswrapper is being loaded on system startup.\n\nA: This same problem just started happening for me a couple days ago and in my search to fix it, I found a post this morning on ubuntuforums.org with an alternative fix. Since I haven't seen any mention of this method yet here, I figured i go ahead and post it for everyone else.\n\nHere's HalfNote5's original post:\nSince I lack enough reputation to post the screenshot here, I've went ahead and copied the text instead.\n12.04 and ndiswrapper modprode \"FATAL: Module ndiswrapper not found\"\n\nJust a heads up for people with ndiswrapper problems (I crawled the\nUbuntu forum and didn't really find this; the info was aggregated from\nseveral other sites.)\nIf you're using an older version of ndiswrapper, and you have the gui\nAND the program interface (and ndiswrapper even shows that the\nhardware is attached) but when you modprobe, you're getting this:\nFATAL: Module ndiswrapper not found\nIt means you need to install\nndiswrapper-source\nndiswrapper-dkms\nndiswrapper-common\n\n(And of course, install ndiswrapper-utils-1.9)\nNone of which appear to be \"Dependencies\" for ndiswrapper, but without\nwhich it simply does not work.\nApologies if this is already posted somewhere, but when I was looking\nfor it, I saw several people asking, but no definitive answers.\nCheers!\nP.S. My install was Xubuntu Alternate. Your experience may vary. ; )\n\nLast edited by HalfNote5; May 26th, 2012 at 09:13 AM.. Reason: slight correction\nLink to HalfNote5's Original Post\n\nSince I use Ubuntu 12.04 LTS as my OS, I just searched each installs name in the Ubuntu Software Center program and installed each one.\nAfter everything finished installing, I reopened ndiswrapper, then removed and reinstalled the wireless driver.\nEver since then, my wireless adapter has working perfectly.\nI hope my answer helps make this fix easier, even if just a little, for others with this same problem in the future.\n\nA: Thanks to whoever posted it. It took me almost a day to get my WiFi working in my old laptop with broadcom PCI wlan. I used ndiswrapper by directly downloading it but it didn't work for me. I tried to install it by compiling the soruce code but I got into a compilation error where it said error: ‘struct kernel_stat’ has no member named ‘cpustat.\nThen I searched and I found that I have to install ndiswrapper-1.58 source. I dowloaded the source and followed the following instructions after unpacking the archive and changing to the source directory.\nsudo make\nsudo make install\nsudo modprobe ndiswrapper\ngksudo gedit /etc/modprobe.d/ndiswrapper.conf\n<< delete all the entries here. it will re create it>>\nsudo ndiswrapper -m\nlsmod | grep ndiswrapper\n<<it should list your module>>\ngksu gedit /etc/modules\n<< add *ndiswrapper* to the end of this file>>\nsudo reboot\n\nNow your WiFi should be up and running.\n\nA: After trying a few suggestions found here and getting nowhere I fixed the dreaded:\n\"FATAL: Module ndiswrapper not found\"\n\nerror message by adding Glenn Washburn's PPA to my software sources. It's fairly easy to do compared to other methods and it's the only thing that worked for me. Just type the following in the terminal:\nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:crass/ndiswrapper\n\nYou'll be prompted for your password of course Then asked to confirm adding this by pressing enter. Then just update your software and it works. Pretty simple. I must mention that when you visit this PPA you'll see this note:\n\nYou can update your system with unsupported packages from this untrusted PPA by adding ppa:crass/ndiswrapper to your system's Software Sources.\n\nI don't know what to make of that but here I am online because of it.\n\nA: I found a fix do this and it will work\n\n\n*\n\n*exit out ndis if you dont have it search it in the package installer\n\n*ndis moduel install both those from package installer\n\n*open it and check if it worked!\n\n\nA: In Ubuntu 14.04 I needed to fix loader.c and pe_linker.c  files in ndiswrapper source code:\n#include <linux/vmalloc.h>\n\nAlso:\nsudo apt-get purge libc6-dev\nsudo apt-get install libc6-dev    \nsudo apt-get install build-essential\n\nThen, I followed the next steps of suggestion #2\n", "Q: Ubuntu 12.04 + RAID0 + Windows 7 not loading I have a PC with 2 Hd (1Tb each) on RAID0. I had a Windows 7 64-bit working for several months.\nWhen I installed the Windows I left a 100GB partition empty to install Ubuntu someday.\nI was using Linuxin Virtualbox, but this week I tried to install Ubuntu 12.04 in this 100GB partition.\nI used the Ubuntu alternate cd, because the 'normal' cd was giving me trouble with the RAID0.

If it is that only that you want your windows operating system to start, Then you can just go for repairing the MBR. You can use your windows disk to go into recovery mode and then follow below procedure to repair your MBR and boot.\nSTEP1: Goto windows recovery mode and open up the command prompt there\nSTEP2: write the following code to accomplish your target:\n        x:\\sources>bootrec /fixmbr\n        x:\\sources>bootrec /fixboot\nSTEP3: Just restart the computer after that and you will loose the GRUB loader and will directly be booted into windows. \n\nNow you need to reinstall the grub to make your ubuntu work again. If you have question regarding re-installing the grub, then just let me know in the comments. I will edit the answer with details for it. \n\nA: Dual booting with the Windows System Partition never worked for me and I'm used to do it different, but while UEFI based systems are continuing to replace BIOS based systems lets try to fix this.\nThere is a wiki page on fixing dual booting for UEFI based systems in the Ubuntu Community Documentation. But you probably don't have bootmgfw.efi since you're using a MS DOS partition table, so that won't work. According to Wikipedia Windows wants to load bootmgr first, which should be located at the root of the Windows System Partition.\nSo mount the partition in Ubuntu and do the following:\ngrub-probe --target=fs_uuid /path/to/windows_system_patition/bootmgr\n\nThat should return the UUID of the Windows System Partition. Now modify your Grub 2 menu entry for Windows like this:\nmenuentry \"Windows 7 (loader) (on /dev/mapper/isw_chjbfeec_DougRaid1)\" --class windows --class os {\n        insmod part_msdos\n        insmod fat\n        insmod ntfs\n        set root='(sda,msdos1)'\n        search --no-floppy --fs-uuid --set=root UUID_of_Windows_System_Partition\n        chainloader (${root})/bootmgr\n    }\n\nReplace UUID_of_Windows_System_Partition with the UUID you got from the previous command. Note that I added insmod fat, because this partition used to be a FAT partition and the target for the chainloader is the Windows Boot Manager. I can also see a w7ldr next to bootmgr in my Windows 7 VM, which should be the Windows 7 Bootloader. Make a copy of the menu entry above and replace bootmgr with w7ldr and try that too. Don't forget to run sudo update-grub after you made the edits, but you probably know that. :-)\nHope this works, I wish you good luck.\n", "Q: Netdisco for Ubuntu server Has anyone had luck installing netdisco through apt-get? I couldn't get it to work. I tried netdisco-frontend, netdisco-backend, netdisco-common, netdisco-installer.\nI used the command:\nsudo apt-get install netdisco-common netdisco-frontend netdisco-backend\n\nEverything installed fine, but I can't get it running. It doesn't seem to have install to /usr/local/netdisco/.\nI have looked all over the internet and there doesn't seem to be an easy way to do this.\nI use server 12.04. Thanks!\n\nA: On this website you can download a script that does the setup in about 15 minutes, fully working. Cheers.\nhttp://netdisco.blogspot.se\n\nA: When you use your package manager to install software, it usually doesn't go to /usr/local. Debian, Ubuntu and many other distributions try to setup software according to the Filesystem Hierarchy Standard (FHS).\nIf you want to see where the files of netdisco are, you can open a shell and enter dpkg -L netdisco-backend. Now you see a listing of files and where they are stored.\nDebian-based installations set the home to /usr/lib/netdisco. The configuration is at /etc/netdisco/netdisco.conf. Furthermore in /usr/share/doc/netdisco* there are several README files. They describe where you find files and what to do after installation.\n", "Q: Missing Operating System when installing 12.04 from USB I wanted to upgrade my 10.04 PC to 12.04. Towards the end of the upgrade, I made the foolish mistake of thinking \"Hibernate\" on the system menu meant \"Sleep\", when it reality it seemed to shut down the computer. When the computer restarted it exploded with the weirdest errors, cumulating in \"Plymouth main process (56) killed by SEGV signal\".\nSo since I didn't have any files I cared about on the computer, I decided to go ahead and clean install 12.04. I used unetbootin on my Macbook Air (no CD drive) to install 12.04 via a downloaded DMG, and tried to boot up the computer to start the installation. I ended up with a \"Missing operating system\" error.\nWhat am I doing wrong? I've read that I need to make the USB drive \"bootable\", but doesn't unetbootin take care of that? It is a Samsung USB drive, but I've reformatted and wiped it so there's no U3 partition.\n\nA: The Macbook Air is known to not be able to boot from an USB stick (see 1, 2).\nYou need to put the live cd on the harddisk as described in 1 or use a special script to make the USB live cd boot on the Macbook Air.\n\nA: It sounds like the computer isn't trying to boot from the USB drive, instead attempting to boot from the first hard drive. When the system first starts booting, see if there is a key you can press to bring up the boot menu (eg. F10 or F12). If not, go into the BIOS or EFI and tell the system to boot from the USB drive first. \nSome systems list the USB drive as another hard drive so you may need to change the order of hard drives so the USB drive is first.\n", "Q: Moving a pane in LibreOffice back to the main window I accidentally moved a pane in LibreOffice from it's nice docked position to a new window. Now I can't move back it.\n\nAs you can see, the Slide Pane is floating as it's own window and not docked like Tasks, etc.\n\nA: To move the window back, simply hold the ctrl key and double click on any non-button area of the window chrome (not the contents btw).\n\nCurrent versions of LibreOffice allow you to drag the Window and it will show a drop target.\n", "Q: Ubuntu 12.04 installation with USB I recently got a Dell ultrabook and was trying to install Ubuntu on it.  \nI was able to successfully download the .iso file onto my USB drive using Universal-USB-installer, and was then able to load the Ubuntu installer.\nHowever, when I chose the option to \"install Windows 7 and Ubuntu side-by-side\", the computer restarted and then opened up Windows instead of continuing to install Ubuntu.\nThen, I tried to change the order in which my computer chooses to boot...booting from the hard drive was ahead of booting from a USB drive, so I switched that.  Then I tried to install Ubuntu again, and the the same thing happened...I chose \"install Windows 7 and Ubuntu side-by-side\" and the computer restarted, and instead of continuing to install Ubuntu, I got prompted to begin the Ubuntu installation process (or to \"try\" Ubuntu).\nAny suggestions???\nAlso, I tried to the \"Windows installer\" by downloading wubi.exe that was supposed to be quick and easy...but then I was only allowed to choose a 30 GB installation size (the partition that Windows is on has currently 92.95 GB with 65.21 GB in Free Space, according to Windows' Computer Management).  I'd like more than 30 GB on Ubuntu, and I don't see why it's not allowing me to choose more than 30GB...\n\nA: After you have installed Ubuntu and the computer is rebooting, you have to remove the USB because the computer will still boot the USB before the harddriver, as you specified in the BIOS settings.\nManual  partitioning\nConsider that this list is long because it guides you closely and was intended to be very comprehensive.\nI think this list of steps should fix your problem, but only run it if you can re-install Windows (in case anything goes wrong or you care about having it):\n\n*\n\n*Backup the data on Windows' you care about, i.e. user files, applications, etc.\n\n*Defragment your hard-disk. This can be done from Windows.\nContrary to intuition, files don't stack up in order in a hard-disk. They can be represented by spread out papers in a box. When you create a new partition you are chopping this box into two pieces: the first being your Windows partition and the second your Linux partition. If your Windows files are stacked up in the Windows piece of the box, you will lose no data the moment you divide your disk; otherwise you will. To stack the Windows files as required - at the beginning of the partition - you defragment the disk.\n\n*Boot from the USB and \"Try\" Ubuntu.\n\n*Partition your system with gparted.\nThere are plenty of guides on the subject already which are easily findable. The idea here is that after defragmenting your disk you will be able to shrink your windows partition manually to a desired size, and use all the rest for Ubuntu.\n\n*Install Ubuntu and when prompted to select the installation type, select manual; there you will use the partitions you made on step 3.\nMake sure that in step 3 you create a primary partition for GRUB, and that in this step you will let Ubuntu install GRUB in such partition.\n\nBy installing Ubuntu this way, you are assured that Ubuntu has available as much space as there is available.\n\nA: Possible reason:\n\n*\n\n*When you choose to use the option \"install Windows 7 and Ubuntu side-by-side\", what ubuntu does is , it will shrink the current windows partition. Create a new partition and install ubuntu on to that. Now Shrinking is the problem because windows system files may be fragmented over many areas in the partition. That's why it can't give you more space than 30GB.\n\n\n*Why GRUB is not being installed? : From windows disk management, check whether the disk is marked as dynamic disk or basic disk. GRUB can't be installed in dynamic disk.\nPost a picture of windows disk management console window if you need more help.\nResolutions:\n\n*\n\n*Create partition manually and install ubuntu.\nOpen disk management in windows, right click on C: and choose to shrink. If it can't shrink to the size you wanted, You have to repartition your disk and have to reinstall windows and then install ubuntu with desired size.\n\nI will update my answer, please post an image before and after shrink.\n\nA: if you want dual-boot, you have to create a new partition.\nif you want to install \"inside\" Windows, use the wubi.exe.\n", "Q: Problem while upgrding from 11.10 to 12.04  I am upgrading from 11.10 to 12.04 using the Update Manager.\nWith about 35 minutes left in the \"installing\" phase of the upgrade, the screen went black, mouse and keyboard dead. Do I need to make a new installation from an ISO CD?  If yes, should I use the 12.04 issue of Ubuntu.\n\nA: I think you should do a new installation by downloading a 12.04 issue from Ubuntu, burn it to a CD or if you have windows use LILI usb creator program (which is freely available) to create a USB bootable disk and do the installation\n", "Q: Need help installing plugin from source with make I am running Ubuntu 12.04 x64 desktop DVD, and I have installed GIMP 2.6.12 from the Ubuntu Software Center.

I'm assuming I will have to edit the Ubuntu partition to add JoliOS, but how will this affect my boot and is it even possible to run 2 linux OS's off the same partition?\n\nA: *\n\n*Back up everything just to be sure.\n\n*Shrink your partitions to free some unpartitioned space on the drive.  This can be done from an Ubuntu Live CD using \"gparted\".  In your case you should be able to just shrink the larger partition.\n\n*Run the installer for the other distro.  When asked where you would like to install, choose the unpartitioned space.  This may involve setting up new partitions manually. When the installer asks if you want to install Grub to the master boot record of your drive, tell it not to (if you are given that option).  It should reboot, but into your existing boot manager.\n\n*Boot into your existing Linux install (Ubuntu).

For example, Audacity, doesn't not have an \"Install\" button, but a \"Use This Source\" from an apparent \"universe\" source (I don't know what this means). I click it, it shows in the \"Progress\" bar, and then disappears. I look into the \"History\" and it does not mention anything being installed.

The upload rate is limited so synching to the cloud I estimate to take 3 hours.  The upload rate is difficult to change since the internet service is provided by the landlord.\nInitially I expected Ubuntu One to keep the computer awake the whole 3 hours.  My Settings > Power was set to 5 minutes. When I left the computer unattended and returned I saw that Ubuntu One was disabled so I re-enabled and I changed Settings > Power to Don't Suspend.  \nMany hours later I returned to see that Ubuntu One was again disabled so I re-enabled.  It did not indicate the synch had completed and this is unexpected.  Somehow I managed to get it to report that the synch was completed, perhaps by closing the application and re-opening it.  \nHow do I stop this application from going to a disabled state?\n\nA: This may be bug #995146.\nThat would mean the \"disabled\" status is wrong.\n", "Q: How do I boot into single-user mode from GRUB? After changing a few lines in xorg.conf, I can no longer boot Ubuntu (I assume it breaks when trying to load up X), so I need a way to boot into a single-user mode. However, there seems to be zero guides on the Internet how to do it, because they all assume I can actually edit files on my computer, and I obviously can't.\nSo how do I load Ubuntu in single-user mode?\nWhen I turned off splash, I figured out the problem: whenever Ubuntu can't load X server due to some error, it switches to tty1 and waits for the prompt, but doesn't turn off the splash.\n\nA: Occasionally, you might not be able to use the single method as described in the accepted answer. In those cases you can tell the Linux kernel to use a different init like so:\ninit=/bin/bash\n\nFor example\n          \n\nA: Not sure why the instruction is not permanent.\nTo make it permanent edit \"/etc/default/grub\"\npico /etc/default/grub\n\nMake the same changes...\nupdate-grub\n\nI changed the line \"ro quiet splash \" \nto \"ro text single \" and i start GUI with \nstartx\n\n\nA: Good question! When booting the machine hold down the left shift key. For more info follow this: \nhttps://wiki.ubuntu.com/RecoveryMode\n\nA: To boot into single user mode you edit the boot instructions for the GRUB menu entry you wish to boot and add the kernel parameter/option single. Brief instructions for how to do this are below. \n\n\n*\n\n*Hold down the left Shift key while rebooting to bring up GRUB menu\n\n*Select (highlight) the GRUB boot menu entry you wish to use.\n\n*Press e to edit the GRUB boot commands for the selected boot menu entry.  \n\n*Look near the bottom of the list of commands for lines similar to  \nlinux /boot/vmlinuz-3.2.0-24-generic root=UUID=bc6f8146-1523-46a6-8b\\\n6a-64b819ccf2b7 ro  quiet splash\ninitrd /boot/initrd.img-3.2.0-24-generic\n\n\n*Change the middle line in (4) by adding the kernel boot parameter single to the end of the line (i.e. after ro  quiet splash).  \nFor this example you would change:\n6a-64b819ccf2b7 ro  quiet splash\n\nto \n6a-64b819ccf2b7 ro  quiet splash single\n\n\n*Press either Ctrl+X or F10 to boot using\nthese kernel options.\nNote: These changes are not persistent. Any change to the kernel boot options made this way will only affect the next boot and only if you start that boot by pressing either Ctrl+X or F10 while still in GRUB edit mode.\n\nA: slm's solution worked for me in Ubuntu 20.04 when I had changed the ownership of the entire /etc directory.\nI followed the instructions here (in the Alternate Root Shell Method section) and by the grace of Jesus I could boot in SINGLE USER MODE. Then I could get into the root shell without the root password (which Ubuntu doesn't give you).\nThis is done (roughly) as follows:\n\n\n*reboot\n\n*enter the GRUB console by pressing shift (left, right, or both?) during the boot splash\n\n*select the regular kernel image you always boot from (this wasn't in the top-level menu, but in a menu 1 level deep)\n\n*press e\n\n*go to the line that starts with linux and move the cursor to the end\n\n*remove the part that says ro quiet splash (or something like that) and add this at the end of the line: rw init=/bin/bash\n\n*press Ctrl-x to boot into that image with these boot parameters\n\nThat's roughly what allowed me to get into a root shell without the root password.\nDon't let Ubuntu lock you out of your own computer with their \"recommended measures\" (ie. forcing you to use sudo, or not giving you the root user of your own computer). (Maybe there's a good reason for those, I don't know.)\n", "Q: How do I remove or uninstall Deluge? I upgraded to 12.04 and Deluge broke. I want to remove it and then add it again.

I realized that I had the GTK version installed so merely deleting deluge didn't do the trick. I used sudo apt-get remove --purge deluge-gtk\n\nA: If sudo apt-get remove --purge deluge succeeded, then the deluge package was successfully removed.\nIf menu items still appear in your dash, it doesn't necessarily mean that the program is still installed, just that links to it remain somewhere.  Possibly, the dash keeps its own cache of what is in your menu, and it takes a little while to realise that a change has been made.\nFeel free to go ahead and reinstall deluge now to see if it works.\nFor future reference, you should look for dotfiles in ~/ or in ~/config that relate to Deluge.  That is the most likely place it would store data for your account.  Try purging or renaming that instead.  That may solve your original problem with it (rather than re-installing it).\n\nA: Did you try complete removal via synaptic package manager? \nInstall synaptic\nsudo apt-get install synaptic\n\nA: As per the OP using sudo apt-get remove --purge deluge is the correct way \nIf you have installed from source files or you need to find leftover Deluge files the Deluge wiki guide has details: RemovingFromSystem\n\nThe most likely reason for it still appearing in Dash is due to a leftover deluge.desktop file. \nYou can use locate deluge it will quickly show every file/folder that is named deluge and you should be able to determine if the application has actually been removed. \nIf you installed Deluge from source then you will manually need to remove the files. The main deluge application folder is usually installed in the python site-packages or dist-packages folder which should be seen in the output from the above command. You will also need to remove the deluge binaries from /usr/local/bin/ or /usr/bin/.\nAs neon_overload mentions, if you are having problems with Deluge, backing up and removing your old config may help fix upgrade issues. The default location is: ~/.config/deluge\n\nA: Run:\nsudo apt-get remove --purge deluge\n\nApparently you realise when you search for 'Deluge' you will still get it popping up on your screen. \nThose are the leftover deluge files - to be completely remove them from your system, \nRun:\nsudo apt autoremove deluge\n\nSearch and no Deluge will appear.....

I have home server running Ubuntu Server 12.04 LTS I want to use as a Bazaar central server. How do I do that? (create repository (if not the same), open ports for listening, create users...).\nEdited\nI found a blog that has stuff needed for a server to be started. But... How do you limit rights for users? Give some users rights to upload, others - download and etc.\nHere is the blog: http://zeth.net/post/366/\n\nA: Here is a blog in which some guy talks about setting up a Bazaar server as they didn't want to publish their code (just like me): http://zeth.net/post/366/\nFirstly, they made a new user for Bazaar (to keep everything nice and clean):\n$ sudo useradd -m bzruser\n\nAfter the user was set up, they simply created a regular repository there:\n$ sudo su bzruser\n$ mkdir -p /home/bzruser/repository/group/project/trunk\n$ cd /home/bzruser/repository/group/project/trunk\n$ bzr init\n\nWhen the repo is created, you simply start the server by using\n$ bzr server --directory=/home/bzruser/repository\n\nWhich starts listening to port 4155 (though it can be changed using --port option).\nOf course, directory hierarchy is up to you, the admin, as well as stuff like making the server start on boot, but it's a different story. Bazaar server is up and running ;)\n\nA: I host my Bazaar repositories via WebDAV. Note that this is not the preferred method because repacking involves lots of traffic (SSH or smart server does not have this problem). That is why I run \"bzr pack\" via cron at night time for all repos. WebDAV is a good solution if you don't want to open up another port, or want to use the authentication methods of Apache like I do. It is the easiest solution in my opinion.\nCreate the file /etc/apache2/conf.d/bzr-repos (name does not matter, but any file in conf.d is included automatically):\n# This assumes you have your repos in /var/bzr-repos which should be owned\n# (or at least read-and-writable) by the user www-data\nAlias /bzr /var/bzr-repos\n<Directory /var/bzr-repos>\n    DAV On\n    Options Indexes\n\n    # The bzr.webdav plugin for http(s)+webdav transport\n    # only works with this option:\n    DirectorySlash Off\n</Directory>\n<Location /bzr>\n    # Put SSLRequireSSL here if you want\n    Order deny,allow\n    Deny from all\n</Location>\n\nThen you can add single repositories like so:\n# Repo stored in /var/bzr-repos/my-repo-name\n<Location /bzr/my-repo-name>\n    Order allow,deny\n    Allow from all\n\n    # If you want authentication (I guess so, or do you want everyone to\n    # be able to push and pull?)\n    AuthType Basic\n    AuthName \"My repository\"\n    AuthUserFile /etc/apache2/my-passwords.passwd\n    Require user my-username\n</Location>\n\nDon't forget to restart Apache then. You might have to enable the DAV module (a2enmod dav dav_fs).\nIn order to use the repository, use the URL \"http+webdav://example.com/bzr/my-repo-name/\" (or https+webdav:// for HTTPS).\n\nA: Bazaar in five minutes\nIf you follow this nice and short tutorial you will be able to create a local Bazaar branch, commit your code, and push it to any location including Launchpad (not really in five minutes but certainly in minutes rather than hours):\nA complete tutorial for advanced Bazaar usage can be found here:\nBazaar User Guide\n", "Q: 12.04 scan mode does not work my HP pSC-2400-series device still prints but does not longer scan since I switched to version 12.04.\nI had no problem with scanning under 11.10.\nWhen trying to scan the software (Impress or Writer) always crashes or simply nothing happens.\nThanks for a hint ! \n\nA: Use XSANE to scan and Download and install HPLIP directly from the HP OPEN SOURCE website. http://hplipopensource.com/hplip-web/downloads.html\nClick on DOWNLOAD HPLIP.

The application preferences in the menu options do not show a shortcut for fast access.\nI'd like to have a unified shortcut to access the applications preferences in any application.\nHow can I get a shortcut for the application preferences of the active application?\n\nA: That's not really possible since it would require all applications to follow the same guidelines for using shortcuts. And obviously they do not.\nMost programs will get you to preferences with alt + e but the next letter is different in various programs. \nSome examples ... \n\n\n*\n\n*You get to preferences for Nautilus and Firefox with alt + e, n (prefereNces). P is for Paste but the letter seems to be different since f looks available)\n\n*If you want to reach preferences on Chrome it is alt + e, s (for Settings) and then shows you the inline settings from the icon in Chrome. The P accesses Paste (Preferences does not have a letter and you might even consider this a bug: the text should have been named Settings).\n\n*Shutter on the other hand has alt + e, p (Preferences). \n\n*Terminal is even more weird: it uses alt + e, o for prOfile preferences.\n\n*Preferences in USC is called Software sources. \n\n\nYou might be able to track down all the text segments in the software but that would be time consuming and temporary: the 1st time you update you might overwrite all your changes. The path you can take to get what you want could be to file bugs against alle applications that do not use for instance the method Nautilus and Firefox use. Seems impossible to me to get done. \n", "Q: Am I using integrated or discrete graphics? My work station is a Macbook Pro which has...\n\n\n*\n\n*integrated graphics: Intel HD 3000\n\n*discrete graphics: Radeon XXXX...\n\n\nI have installed drivers for the discrete graphics right after installation.\nDuring normal usage, I notice that the calculated time for the remaining battery life frequently changes significantly - therefore I assume that Ubuntu 12.04 switches between the integrated and discrete graphics.\nHowever, the indicated battery life only changes between 1:30 and 3 hours, which is significantly less than the 5-6 hours I get when using OSX 10.7.X.\n\n\n*\n\n*Is all of this this due to an overhead caused by 'bad' drivers that I have to expect - or is it just that I'm using discrete graphics all the time?\n\n*How can check what graphics I'm currently using?\n\n\nA: You should be able to see what video drivers are being loaded by looking at the X server log in /var/log/Xorg.0.log.\nAlternatively, the OpenGL renderer string.  For instance, on my desktop system I see:\n$ glxinfo | grep 'OpenGL renderer string'\nOpenGL renderer string: Gallium 0.4 on AMD JUNIPER\n\nWhich is consistent with my system having a Radeon card.\n", "Q: What options exists to sleep the display?

(shortcut, command in terminal,... )\n\nA: You could use compizconfig-settings-manager (in universe) and enable the commands plugin.  Pick a command slot (any number will work) and enter xset dpms force off then bind the command to the edge or corner of your choice under the edge bindings tab.\nYou could also use gnome-screensaver-command -a instead of xset to activate the screensaver (blank screen).

When I was using 10.04 LTS the temperature was around 60C even when watching HD movies etc... Now with 12.04 LTS my the temp is around 70+. And get easy over 80C when starting to use the computer. I did install thinkfan and configure it:\netc/thinkfan.conf\n(0,     0,      55)\n(1,     54,     57)\n(2,     56,     60)\n(3,     57,     63)\n(4,     58,     65)\n(5,     60,     66)\n(7, 70, 80)\n(127,   75, 32767)\nIt's really 12.04 LTS more heavy? That much to use that much more of CPU. Or I'm missing something? :)\np.s. It is possible that there is a bug for showing the temperature and actual temperature is same? Or is this just my humble wish :).\n\nA: I have a W500 and just put 12.04 on.  I did enable the ATI card.  I am fairly certain the fan will not go to the fastest speed (7).  I cannot get manual options or things like thinkfan to drive it.  I loved tpfan-admin, but something in python changed per this bug.\nIn the meantime, I was able to force using:\necho level 7 | sudo tee /proc/acpi/ibm/fan\n\n(Found via http://www.thinkwiki.org/wiki/How_to_control_fan_speed.)\nI swear yesterday I couldn't get anything out of /proc/acpi/ibm.\nSomething changed with the reboot today?!\n\nA: I have the same problem: thinkpad t500 with 12.05 LTS (64bit) is overheating. Temperatures are around 70+ C (idle) and can get easily over 80/90C.\nWhen manually adjusting the fan speed in \"/proc/acpi/ibm/fan\", I can reduce the temperature a quite a bit but they are still high 60+.\nSomehow the fanspeed is not going automatically to the max (level 7 or \"engaged\") although temperatures are over 90C.\nBut I think the main problem is the automatic control of the cpu frequency. \nThe use of powertop revealed that the cpus are running in \"turbo mode\" nearly all the time. Right now, just writing this repley in firefox, the turbo mode is 95%.\nA easy solution to this problem is to install indicator-cpufreq and set the cpufreq manually or use powersave governor.\nI feel no slowdown of the laptop but temperature are now around 40/45C when idle.\n\nA: What about Kernel 3.4? Any news about that? It's really fixing the problem? Since my Lenovo T500 REALLY got overheated (was like a dream, but I saw a sparkle going from my laptop) I don't want to try and burn my laptop. So I would be really happy if anyone can tell me what is going on with 12.04 and overheating problem. Thanks!\np.s. As I said... Kernel 3.4 should be fixing this problem. Indicator-cpufreq doesn't really help. After little bit just jumps back to \"ondemand\" mode and get overheated. My laptop got a DEEP cleaning. So it's not \"dust problem\". :(\n\nA: Any news? Anything new about overheating problem? I still have same problems about overheating with my lenovo T500. I did install AMD Catalyst 12.6 drivers, Jupiter and also modified grub and my cpu temp still gets high (highest 90+°C). I really need to find a solution... The fact is that in Windows 7 x64 my the average temp is 65°C. Running full screen flash (firefox/youtube) on ubuntu 12.04 is like having a barbeque on my laptop :(... In W7 is just little above 60°C. Where it comes that difference? p.s. Is not just using flash. Is any other app too. The average temp on ubuntu 12.04 is 15°C higher then W7. I had before 10.04 and never had any problem like that... The temp was even lower then W7. Would love to have 10.04 but there is a problem with app upgrades :( (or I just don't know how to upgrade app with the old kernel/ubuntu)\n", "Q: Is there any advantage in using propietary video drivers over the open source ones? I have been using Ubuntu as my main OS for 3 cycles now, with a Radeon HD 4870 video card. In every cycle the open source video drivers were not enough, meaning that something was not working right. Weather it was the movies or Unity 3D (compiz cube in the old days) I always had something which was not working. So I always installed the ATI proprietary drivers, thus solving the issues. \nPrecise was the first OS upgrade I have ever made (for the old ones I always made a complete new install). So, before upgrade, I have uninstalled the ATI drivers and reverted to the open source one in order to avoid issues.\nAfter the upgrade everything is working as it should with the open source drivers Gallium 0.4. I have all the nice 3D features and full HD movies are running.\nSo, I am really asking myself, if there would be any reason for me to turn back to the propriety drivers from ATI? I mean do you guys know for sure there are some features present that are not in the open source one drivers?\nThanks.\n\nA: The proprietary drivers typically enable or enhance 3D support on some cards, as well as potentially providing enhanced 2D. They are also said to allow the card to operate at a lower temperature. They might, I suppose, also enable fan control if the open driver doesn't.\nIn practical terms, it comes down to the combination of driver and your particular set of hardware and the programs you use. Adding the drivers, and falling back to the open driver, is easy using Additional Drivers.\nIn my case, during the 12.04 beta period, I found that using ATM's Radeon driver corresponded with frequent crashe of a few of the applets I was using. Since I don't need to push my machine's 3D capabilities, I opted for the open driver.\n\nA: As a complement to jonc's great answer, and in one word: performance. \nIn virtually all game reviews, performance of proprietary drivers beat the open source ones by a large margin, although the gap is shortening as in each release the open source drivers get impressively better.\nBut the point is: do you need performance? For all purposes but serious 3D gaming, open source drivers provide decent performance. It runs Unity just fine (which is a 3D desktop), and it also handles 720p and 1080p videos quite well.\nOpen source drivers are usually more stable, developed by people that understand Linux much better than ATI or NVidia, and definitely more secure, since they are open and thus can be audited, while proprietary ones are a black box. \nOn the other hand, proprietary have AMD's Catalyst Center, a nice GUI where you can fine-tune and have control about some features.\nBut these minor differences apart, in the end of day performance is still the major difference when it comes to proprietary vs open source video drivers.\n\nA: Sometime the open source drivers are better, sometimes the proprietary ones.  If it ain't broke, don't fix it!\n", "Q: When was a package installed? You know the problem: \"I didn't change anything\"\nBut now, it's broken. Is there a way to see when some package was installed or a list of all packages sorted by time?\n\nA: Open the software centre and chose history tab  you can see the time there.\n\n\nA: For packages that have not been installed via the Software Center but from the command line via apt-get we may view the logfile in var/log/apt/history.log.\n", "Q: Can I configure Alt-Tab to always switch applications? I have windows for an editor, a browser, a web application, and a development tool for that browser open.  Unity groups them as two applications: Chrome and Eclipse.\nAlt-Tab switches application group, \nAlt-` switches windows in the same group. But, if my current window and previous window  are from the same application group (Chrome), \nAlt-Tab switches to the previous window, not to Eclipse.\nHow can I configure Alt-Tab to always switch between application groups, not windows of the same app?\n\nA: Here is how to solve this:\n\n\n*\n\n*Open CompizConfig Settings Manager\n\n*Go to the Unity Plugin settings and deactivate (uncheck enbabled) for the Alt+Tab and Alt+Tab+Shift shortcuts (or even all the other \"switcher\" related shortcuts.\n\n*Then go to the CompizConfig main menu and to the \"Window Management\" section and enable one of the \"Switchers\", for example \"Shift Switcher\" or \"Static Application Switcher\".\n\n\nAll of these Switchers expose the old behaviour.\n\nIf you don't mind using the mouse instead of keyboard-shortcuts - one more note:\nThe Unity Launcher (the menu that comes up when you go to the left side of the screen) also works like an \"old\" taskbar. Clicking on an active app's icon brings that app's window to front. If an app icon indicates two or more windows of one app open, double-clicking opens a multiple-window grid that I think is more convenient than the multi-window \"sub selector\" that comes up through Alt+Tab for that same app group.\n\nUpdate:\nActually now, I've come to accept the \"grouping switcher\" but with one novel way of using it (novel, at least for me):\nI've found out that once you're working in one window from a group, you can switch between windows from this group by using ALT+^ (instead of ALT+TAB), for example switching between multiple instances of leafpad. And switching between windows from one group is what I usually do most, or wanted to do with ALT+TAB before. So this as a tip for everyone not knowing this very handy short-cut.\n\nA: Here is a workaround. Install ccsm, then deselect Desktop > Ubuntu Unity Plugin > Switcher > Automatically grid windows on timer in switcher. You might need to run \"$ unity --replace\" to get the settings to stick.\nHaving this setting on does the following. When holding onto Alt+Tab, if you wait with your selection over an application icon with multiple windows open, after a short time the window thumbnails are exposed. If this setting is off, then Alt+Tab only shows the application icon.\n(It's a bit odd that changing this setting should have this side-effect, as it's not directly related, so it might be a bug? Perhaps it's a feature, but I've filed a bug in launchpad anyway.)\n\nA: By default the switcher is configured to switch applications like you mentioned. If you wish to change the behavior so that Alt+Tab will switch windows you can try the following:\nLaunch CompizConfig Settings Manager and choose the \"Ubuntu Unity Plugin\".\nCurrently the 'Switcher' tab probably looks like this:\n\nTry moving the configuration of assigned keys from the first two rows to the marked last two.\n", "Q: Ubuntu One Taking up 40-170% of CPU usage with i5 processor I am backing up all of my photos and docs, so I have purchased 160GB of storage. Yes, it is a lot of photos...\nI am finding that my system is running very slowly while the backups are taking place, and Ubuntu One is taking up a massive amount of my CPU time. System monitor is reporting it using 40-170% of the CPU time. I also can't easily view my 'Pictures' folder, i seems to hang for a long time figuring out which folders have/have not been backed up yet (I guess).\nI am running Ubuntu 12.04 LTS with all latest patches. I have laptop with a Intel i5 processor with 8GB ram.\nThanks.\n\nA: Before uploading to the server, Ubuntu One needs to take a checksum of each file, and that involves reading the file in its entirety. If you do it 160GB in one chunk, it will likely take a whole day to churn through it, and depending on the disc you have it on can make the system slow. This is inescapable, although there might be some ways to mitigate its impact in your work.\nIn general the Ubuntu kernel should be smart enough to find the sweet spot in the compromise between getting the work done and over with, and letting use your machine. If you need it to back off a bit, you can use nice and ionice to do that. For example, you could use ionice to set ubuntuone-syncdaemon to only hit the disc when nothing else needs it, and use give other processes some preference for CPU usage,\n$ ionice -c 3 -p $( ps h -o pid -C ubuntuone-syncdaemon )\n$ renice -n 10 -p $( ps h -o pid -C ubuntuone-syncdaemon )\n\nkeep in mind that this will make the process take a lot longer (but given that it'll start uploading as it goes, it might not be a problem). This should, as a side effect, lower the CPU usage as it will have less data to checksum in any given moment in time.\n", "Q: Installing the Numenta Platform I want to install the Numenta Platform in Ubuntu12.4.\nIt created by python 2.5 and for Ubuntu 9.4.\nYou can see the installing step and requerment in the below link\nThe Numenta installing help\nBut in Ubuntu 12.4 we have the python 2.7 and upper so when I tried to play the Numenta Platform faced to this error:\nImportError: libpython2.5.so.1.0: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory\n\nAfter I inserted this commands in .bashrc file to change the python path to my Platform folder:\nNTA=$HOME/nta \nexport PATH=$NTA/bin:$PATH \nexport PYTHONPATH=$NTA/lib/python2.7/site-packages:$PYTHONPATH\n\nBut faced to the recent error again.

It can recognize my monitors properly, but you have to install it manually and not via Ubuntu's Additional drivers interface. Follow the instructions here to install this driver (you have to blacklist Ubuntu's open source drivers first), you can skip the CUDA part.\nAnd to be clear, NVidia is to blame for this mess, they hold up a lot of information to open source developers.\n", "Q: Unable to create .zip files or modify .xpi with file roller in Oneiric I'm trying to modify a Firefox plugin in .xpi format using file roller.

We then booted into Windows, shrank the Windows partition (/dev/sda3) and the installed Ubuntu 12.04 (we partitioned the remaining space into / (sda5), /home (sda6), /swap (sda7) and free space for another Windows drive later.) I specified GRUB to install to /dev/sda. /dev/sda1 and /dev/sda2 were recovery/system partitions.\nAfter rebooting, grub showed the Ubuntu boot options in the menu, and an option for a Windows recovery on /dev/sda1 and a similar one for /dev/sda2. It did not show an entry for Windows 7 on /dev/sda3. I booted into Ubuntu and ran sudo update-grub, but this failed to detect Windows on /dev/sda3. I checked the contents of /dev/sda3 and Windows is still there.\nI hope I can resolve this soon, as this is not a good first impression of an LTS release to someone who has just decided to start using Ubuntu/GNU/Linux!\n\nA: It turned out that one of the two entries in the existing menu was actually an entry for Windows 7, so the solution was to try both of the entries (while being careful not to accidentally start any actual Windows recovery operations).

How can I set a display resolution of 1366x768 in a Acer Aspire One ZG5 within Ubuntu 12.04? The only resolutions available are 1280x768 and 800x600.\n\nA: Answer: It is not possible to set the display resolution to 1366x768 in a Acer Aspire One ZG5.  The Acer Aspire One ZG5 does not support resolutions higher than 1024x600.  \nAs you have 1280x768 listed under System Settings > Displays, it is very likely you do not have an Acer Apsire One ZG5.  Ubuntu 12.04 will correctly detect the display's native resolutions and populate the settings appropriately during installation.  \nSource: http://support.acer.com/acerpanam/netbook/0000/Acer/AspireOneAOA150/AspireOneAOA150sp2.shtml\n\nA: I believe what he is talking about is DOWNSCALING on the ZG5.\nThere is a program for windows that downscales 1024x768 on a realtime 1024x600 display.\nIt is called a1ctl.\nThe result is that the picture is not that good.  The upside is that you can see the entire normal screen which is important for some programs and some games.  That is why a downscaling program for ubuntu, any flavor of ubuntu, linux is so important.\nIn the future I may be working with small tft screens with omap processors for robotics.

I always have ~/bin added to the $PATH in my ~/.profile. As is default in Ubuntu. \n# set PATH so it includes user's private bin if it exists\nif [ -d \"$HOME/bin\" ] ; then\n    PATH=\"$HOME/bin:$PATH\"\nfi\n\nHowever, when trying out software, hacking together a script, or testing new software that has no PPA's, makefiles and such, I prefer to organize them in directories. For example (I have about twelve of these projects in my ~/bin at this moment):\nber@audrey:~ ☙ ls bin/replicatorg-0033/\ncontributors.txt  examples  lib-i686    license.txt  readme.txt   scripts        todo.txt\ndocs              lib       lib-x86_64  machines     replicatorg  skein_engines  tools\n\nThis is some java application. replicatorg is the executable. \nNow, I could do four things, but I am looking for another, better way: \n\n\n*\n\n*Symlink the exectuable in ~/bin. ln -s bin/replicatorg-0033/replicatorg bin/replicatorg. This sometimes works, not in this case. The application is poorly written and expects libraries relative to its binary: it will not run when symlinked or copied out of its directory. \n\n*Add every subdirectory to $PATH as well. But that means editing ~/.profile everytime I move, download or git-clone new directories.\n\n*Install the applications properly systemwide by creating a makefile/install script. Seen as that most of the applications are quick hacks, ugly, in development, scripts and tools, that is not a good idea, IMHO.\n\n*Move all the contents of ~/replicatorg-0033/ into ~/bin. Right.\n\n\nSo: how do you organize your ~/bin?\n\nA: *\n\n*Add every subdirectory to $PATH as well. But that means editing ~/.profile everytime I move, download or git-clone new directories.\nNo need to edit every time, try something like this:\nif [ -f ~/bin ]; then\n   for i in $( find ~/bin -type d ); do\n     PATH=$PATH:$i\n   done\nfi\n\n\nA: I create a separate directory for holding packages (~/apps). If there is a program that I want to have in my $PATH, I either create a symlink in ~/bin or create a shell script wrapper in ~/bin if the program in question does not like symbolic links:\n#!/bin/sh\nexec ~/apps/package/bin/someprogram \"$@\"\n\nFor larger packages with many programs, adding the directory to your $PATH may be preferable to avoid a ~/bin directory with many symlinks to a single project. This depends on your personal preferences though.\n", "Q: How to stop HUD from appearing while video playback?

Just to be sure, you can run this command:\nsudo ufw enable\n\nIf it says it is active, it is... Active and will stay active. Even if you have the firewall gui closed.\n\nA: check status by executing sudo ufw status in the terminal.\n\nA: Though it's been some time since the question was asked, I'd like to answer it ;) You phrased it correctly in your question when you wrote \"it looks like it's inactive\". The GUI shows you the firewall as inactive because it doesn't know any better.\nAs you've seen from the answers above, you need root privileges on the command line (sudo) to check the firewall status. It's the same for the GUI. You start the GUI program as the user you logged into your system with, so the GUI programs privileges are the same as that users privileges. That user probably has no business to know anything about the firewall, so the firewall isn't telling that user (and, in extension, the GUI) whether it's active or not. And because the GUI can't positively tell that the firewall is active, it rather shows it as inactive. It would give people a sense of false security if the GUI would just go, \"I can't really tell, but let's just assume the firewall is doing its thing\" ;) \"Unlocking\" actually means \"providing the programm with root privileges\", so now the GUI can ask the firewall about it status and show it correctly.\n", "Q: Bash Tab Auto-complete not working for apt apt-get install and apt-cache policy do not complete package names.\nI have double checked /etc/bash.bashrc, no irregularities.\nGoogled for answers but none suffice.\nAny help/advice?\n\nA: Is your shell prompt looking like $ instead of user@host:~$?

To fix this you need to run grub-install, which when run from a LiveCD either requires a chroot or the --boot-directory= argument, and make sure that you tell grub-install to install to the MBR (not to a partitition) of the drive which your BIOS is booting from (don't assume that you know which one this is, it's commonly not the one people think is being booted from when they have multiple hard drives).

Set 24 or 32 bit. the default 8 bit is unusable\nResolution.\nDepending on the target and your own Screen sizes some experimentation may be required.\nThe Remmina Scale Mode works very well, and allows you to fit ALL the target screen into your Remmina RDP Window.\nI found creating some Custom resolutions was very handy, to create a window which fits nicely on my screen without scrollbars, and then use Scale mode to fit the target into that.\nEG on my 1366 x 768 screen,  I use a custom resolution of 1024 x 640, which gives me a window that fits my screen leaving the Unity Top & Side menus visible, along with a bit of space to reveal windows of other apps.\nThe Group Function is handy if you have many target systems. In my case I create one for each of my customers, and then group machines by customer.\n", "Q: How can I browse Maildir directories? I've backed up some email accounts (e.g. Gmail) using getmail.

(Specifically I want to change the color of tooltip) I had maverick and I have customized Ambiance theme to have light background color for tooltips. But from Natty onwards I can't see the 'Customize' button anywhere. How can I customize the themes in some user friendly way?\n\nA: Sadly, there is no \"user friendly\" way anymore. Gnome 3 doesnt come with a \"gnome-appearance-properties\"..\nWhat you can do is make your own theme .. (I know ..) or tweak already existing themes. Even harder now, you have gtk2 and gtk3 themes to tweak...\nFor example, Ambiance:\nCopy paste '/usr/share/themes/Ambiance' to '~/.themes/My_Ambiance'.\nEdit colors (ie #FFFFFF, #??????) in '~/.themes/My_Ambiance/gtk-3.0/gtk.css' AND '~/.themes/My_Ambiance/gtk-2.0/gtkrc'.\nChanging tooltip_bg_color and tooltip_fg_color in both files should work for you.\nYou can use zenity --color-selection to select your color.\nTo apply your \"new\" theme, you can use myunity (in the repo).\nYou might have to restart X to see the changes.\nPS: That's no anwser to your question (NOT USER FRIENDLY) but it was to big to post as a comment.\n", "Q: How can I check if my CPU is AMD64 compatible? I'm downloading both versions of Ubuntu 12.04 at this moment. I'd like to install AMD64 on my portable, even though it's an Intel machine. Is there a website (or another way) where I can check compatibility?\nAcer Aspire 5745G-724G50Mnks, Intel i7 with 4Gb RAM\n\nA: To find information about your CPU including architecture, execute lscpu in terminal.\nExample:\nlscpu\n\nyields ...\n\nArchitecture:          i686\nCPU op-mode(s):        32-bit, 64-bit\nByte Order:            Little Endian\nCPU(s):                4\nOn-line CPU(s) list:   0-3\nThread(s) per core:    2\nCore(s) per socket:    2\nSocket(s):             1\nVendor ID:             GenuineIntel\nCPU family:            6\nModel:                 42\nStepping:              7\nCPU MHz:               2301.000\nBogoMIPS:              4589.37\nVirtualization:        VT-x\nL1d cache:             32K\nL1i cache:             32K\nL2 cache:              256K\nL3 cache:              3072K\n\nFor Intel systems, the Vendor ID is - GenuineIntel and for AMD - AuthenticAMD. \nBut they are compatible. It is a bit of an historical artifact in that AMD was the creator of the 64 bit 'long' mode, and later Intel matched that creation.\nBut naming often refers to any 64 bit binary as an AMD/64bit format, usually with the label 'AMD64'. \n\nA: Acer Aspire 5745G-724G50MNKS is 64 bit so you can run the amd64 download on it. I use the serial number (7545G) to google it and try to find items that included the architecture. Shops sell it with Windows 64 installed. \nYou will run into problems: looks like it is not 100% compatible with Ubuntu since I also found a bug report on this machine. It has amd64 stated as architecture so you can use amd64 on this.\n\nA: This is a more general but very practical answer to questions like this. We assume that we have no idea on what hardware we are, and we do not want to know anything about processors or achitecture of our system.\n\n\n*\n\n*32-bit processors are rare nowadays\n\n*Therefore download the am64 64-bit iso of Ubuntu and create a USB or CD boot medium\n\n*Boot with this and choose \"Try out Ubuntu\"\nIf that is a success and you are able to try out Ubuntu on your machine you then know for sure that your CPU is capable of running 64-bit Ubuntu. In addition you will also know that other hardware you may have is compatible. An installation will then be a success. If it fails go ahead with the 32-bit version.\n\nA: you could also get it from the proc.\ncat /proc/cpuinfo | grep \"vendor_id\"\n\nor LSCPU as someone else already mentioned. And if you want to have a script that detects the vendor, then you could do something like  the following:\nvendor=$(lscpu | awk '/Vendor ID/{print $3}')\nif [[ \"$vendor\" == \"GenuineIntel\" ]]; then\n   echo \"Intel cpu\"\nelif [[ \"$vendor\" == \"AuthenticAMD\" ]]; then\n   echo \"AMD cpu\"\nelse\n    echo \"cpu vendor: $vendor\"\nfi\n\n", "Q: Emulate Keypad on Laptop I have a laptop without a numeric keypad on which I'm running Ubuntu 12.04, and I very much enjoy playing roguelike games.

To get around the limitation of not having a numpad, I would like to be able to bind a key combination, for example Shift + Left Arrow to another key, in this case 1; unfortunately, my research so far has only turned up how to bind a key combination to a command. I'm sure there's something blaringly obvious that I'm missing, but as for what it is ...\nAny help would be greatly appreciated!\n\nA: if you want to do that on Windows there is very useful scripting language AutoHotKey which can do a lot with scripting interface.\nA perfect alternative to AutoHotKey is AutoKey. Very useful whether you want to remap keys or assign abbreviation(adr) and it will write your full address!!\n\nAutoKey is a desktop automation utility for Linux and X11. It allows\n  you to manage a collection of scripts and phrases, and assign\n  abbreviations and hotkeys to these.

The banners doesn't seem to be an advertising space nor do the developers pay to have their software featured there.

Empathy's \"Ubuntu\" Theme Is quite attractive.\nIs there any way of using empathy themes on pidgin(specifically the Ubuntu Theme)?\n\nA: The short answer, no. \nEmpathy chat themes are made to support Adium based themes (Mac only IM client). A FAQ link about Empathy client (the first 3 questions answer questions about Empathy themes and how to create your own): \nhttp://live.gnome.org/Empathy/FAQ#How_can_I_install_new_themes_in_Empathy_.3F\nPidgin themes uses a XML file to create buddy list themes which can also control the style of the messenger as well: \nhttp://developer.pidgin.im/wiki/BuddyListThemes \nSince the Adium Message Style code ( http://trac.adium.im/wiki/CreatingMessageStyles ) uses a different structure then Pidgin, the conversion process might take awhile but can be done.\nIf you really like the Ubuntu message style for Pidgin, converting it to that buddy list theme XML file format might be the best way. Once its converted, it can be offer to the Ubuntu packaging team so they can use it for future installs (just putting that out there ... wishful thinking).\nThe location of the Adium message style that you like can be found here on your system:\n/usr/share/adium/message-styles/ubuntu.AdiumMessageStyle (directory)\n\nI hope this explains more about Pidgin and Empathy themes.\n", "Q: How to play MP3 files using Rhythmbox? Yesterday I just installed the Ubuntu 12.04 for the first time, the problem is that I can't play and of the MP3 files that I have.  \nI get this error:  \n\nRequired plugin could not be found Python (v2.7) requires to install plugins to play media files of the following type: MPEG-1 Layer 3 (MP3) decoder\n\nPlease help me so I can play the files. Thanks\n\nA: Ubuntu comes with free and open source software by default, so proprietary software, like the software you need to play mp3's, is not included on a fresh install. But you can still install it. Click on the link below, or start the Ubuntu Software Center, from there, install a package called ubuntu-restricted-extras. That should solve your issue.\n\nAnother way to get this done is just to try to play an mp3 file. A plugin search will appear. Click the Install button after the search is completed. This also works.\n\nA: First enable the Multiverse repository.to do that open Software Sources and click on spftware restricted by copyright(multiverse repository)(you can also enable all as i have done)  \n \nThen just open the terminal and type\nsudo apt-get install ubuntu-restricted-extras \nAlso as in your case you do not seem to have Python. Install that by typing\nsudo apt-get install python\nif this does not work then download this package : Python for 32 bit systems\n\nA: I think that you have to change your download server. Python 2.7.3 is already pre-installed in ubuntu 12.04 so it is not python which causes the error but which throws it. And you also mentioned that you have a working internet connection but are nevertheless unable to download the ubuntu-restricted-extras. \nSo take a look at this page to learn how to change your download server\n", "Q: Stop Ubuntuone-syncdaemon from running in background automatically Is there a way to stop ubuntuone-syncdaemon automatically (and all other Ubuntu One related processes) from running in the background after I quit the Ubuntu One app? Like when you quit Dropbox, it will also stop all its syncing processes? I mean, there should be some simpler ways of doing it rather than killing it manually via terminal or system monitor?\n\nA: If you don't use Ubuntu One (Canonical's cloud service), you can just get rid of the entire suite by typing the following into the Terminal:\nsudo apt-get purge ubuntuone-client\n\nYou can always get it again at a later point with all your files remaining if you want it back.\n\nA: You can use the Ubuntu One Indicator. It works like the Dropbox indicator (or tray icon), and you can use it to disconnect and reconnect to Ubuntu One with two clicks (open the menu, click the item) or using the HUD. Disconnect will kill the daemon, and connecting again will spawn it.\n\nYou can install it from this PPA:\nsudo apt-add-repository ppa:rye/ubuntuone-extras\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get install indicator-ubuntuone\n\nIt will be added to your auto-startup programs, so if you don't want it to start you will need to delete it from there.\nTo run it:\n/usr/lib/indicator-ubuntuone/indicator-ubuntuone\n\nIf you plan to use it a lot, you should probably simlink it to bin (for easy command line access) or create .desktop file for it (for Dash/Menu access)\n\nA: The Ubuntu One syncronization process (syncdaemon) doesn't have a window, so you can't minimize it. If you don't want to start it when you login, just remove it from your autostart applications.\nOn the other hand, if you are not going to have it running, there is no point on having it installed at all.\n\nA: In the U1 control panel there is an option to set U1  to not connect automatically. Perhaps  this is what you need. When you login U1 will not start and you have to start it manually through the control panel.\n\nA: I know I'm late but this was the first hit on Google when I was looking for an answer to the same question as the OP.

Hopefully, it looks like only restricted to some pluggins.\n\nA: Since today (at least for me). In the Ubuntu 32 bit and 64 bit version of 12.04, updating to the latest Nvidia 295.49 fixed all lag problems.\n\nConfirmed on both 32/64 after restarting and toying around with several windows and wine apps.

I guess it tells the kernel, \"dont aggressively move stuff to swap from physical RAM\". It was a huge improvement. Original value of swappiness was 60.\nsudo sysctl vm.swappiness=10\n\nFor temporally change to 10.\nSource: http://modifyubuntu.com/#swap\n\nA: Which nvidia drivers are you running?  (open \"NVIDIA X Server Settings\", look for NVIDIA Driver Version under X Server Information).\nversion 295.33 and 295.40 have a horrible performance regression that makes my ubuntu pretty much unusable because of the lag.  I have a GeForce 210, quad-core i5, intel SSD, and 8GB ram.  System Monitor shows compiz using ~25% cpu constantly.\nInstalling 295.49 fixes the problem.\n\nA: If none of the above comments, answer(s) help - \nWhat I've found here, (nvidia) is that at log in all is pretty good. But sooner or later things get stuffed up & slow. Opening, closing, min & restoring windos, switching WS's, smooth scrolling,  ect. ect. \nAt least here disabling the animations plugin in compiz clears it all up.

My workstation with Ubuntu 12.04 is a MacBook Pro which supports a Multitouch Trackpad.\nUnfortunately, I'm constantly accidentally triggering the three finger touch gesture to resize a window:\n\nHow can I disable this gesture?\n\nA: The trackpad is configured by default to ignore three-finger taps (and three-finger clicks), and can be set it to regain control of it, thus overriding the window move association to three-finger taps. This is how it can be done:\n\n\n*\n\n*Look for the relevant property - open a terminal and type in:\nxinput\n\nLocate the line containing the trackpad details (e.g. ↳ CyPS/2 Cypress Trackpad                    id=12   [slave  pointer  (2)]\n), and note its id value. Now type in:\nxinput list-props [id]\n\nwhere [id] is replaced by the id value (which is 12 in the given example). Now locate the Synaptics Tap Action property (e.g. Synaptics Tap Action (282):  2, 3, 0, 0, 1, 3, 0) and note its number, it will be enclosed inside round brackets (here it's 282). Also note the property values, we will use them later.\n\n*Assuming you want this behavior at startup, create a shell script and add it to the startup programs. Let's call this script trackpad.sh. Our goal is to replace the last value with a new one, e.g. for middle click. Edit the script to contain the following: \n#!/bin/bash\n\nxinput set-prop [xinput-prop-id] [prop-number] [TR] [BR] [TL] [BL] [F1] [F2] 2\n\nOur concrete example command will than look like this (just for the sake of demonstration):\nxinput set-prop 12 282 2, 3, 0, 0, 1, 3, 2\n\nNotice that we replaced only the last value from 0 to 2, to signify middle click. You can choose any between 1 (left click), 2 (middle click), or 3 (right click).\n\n*Grant the script with execution permissions, and run it. You're good to go!\nReference\n\n\n*\n\n*Synaptics man page\n\nA: Install Compiz config manager:\nsudo apt-get install compizconfig-settings-manager\n\nthen run compiz config manager (ccsm in terminal) or simply type ccsm in dash.\nand find at the bottom of plugins list:\nUnity MT Grab Handles to disable it.\n\nA: I have solved this issue by setting the following configuration values (initial values were 0):\nsynclient ClickFinger3=2\nsynclient TapButton3=2\n\n\nA: The solutions above did not work on my OS, Ubuntu 16.04, and I have a Dell Precision. TapButton3 and ClickFinger3 did not have any affect.

When it comes to creating installable live CD clones of a system with its installed software, it fails miserably.   With Relinux, you get the base OS, plus whatever packages you include via Relinux.  Very nice, to be sure, but a far cry from Remastersys's simple elegance of just grabbing and wrapping up everything exactly as it is for your later live-disc amusement.\nRelinux may be \"better\" at making a particular distro, but FAILS MISERABLY if what you want is a live image of your current system.\n\nA: Its happening because there is a deb-src line in your /etc/apt/sources.list file.

It is tricky because your USB drive has to be formated in a special way. I am not sure about the details, but there are some guides here.

I am writing a startup script that takes an argument and launches a process based on the argument value. \nExample : I want to launch my groovyConsole located inside some directory using the starter script like this. \nsh Starter.sh groovy \n\nInside the script this is the logic\nif [ $1 = \"groovy\" ] \nthen\n    cd Works/Groovy/groovy-1.8.6/bin\n    ./groovyConsole\nfi\n\nThis does start the process but I see that this process is bind with the terminal window. If I close the terminal window the process is being killed (obviously). So I want to know if there is a way that running the above command will execute the script and start the process but close the terminal window?\n\nA: You can detach it from your current process with nohup and &\n\nif [ $1 = \"groovy\" ] \nthen\n    cd Works/Groovy/groovy-1.8.6/bin\n    nohup ./groovyConsole & \nfi\nThis would leave the command groovyConsole running until you kill it.\nThis does not close the terminal window though buy you do that like this ...\nsh Starter.sh groovy && exit\n\n\nA: I am not an expert, how ever this should work.\nif [ $1 = \"groovy\" ] \nthen\n    Works/Groovy/groovy-1.8.6/bin/groovyConsole &\n    exit\nfi\n\nExplanation: \n\n\n*\n\n*No need to CD, just run it directly with absolute path.\n\n*& start applications in background\n\n*exit to get exit the terminal\n\n\nA: try change  ./groovyConsole  to  ./groovyConsole &\nand add an exit after the line\n\nA: In order for a shell script to close its parent process, it has to kill it explicitly.  It is also a very bad practice to do this (because down the road you might be running this script in an environment other than what you're expecting), but if you really want to, you can try:\n#!/bin/sh\nif [ $1 = \"groovy\" ] \nthen\n    cd Works/Groovy/groovy-1.8.6/bin\n    nohup ./groovyConsole &\n    kill $PPID\nfi\n\n", "Q: How to fix \"Unable to start services\" in VMware Player 4.0.3. on Ubuntu 12.04 32 Bit I just updated to Ubuntu 12.04 and installed the lastest VMware (4.0.3).\nWhen it starts it shows \"Before you can run VMware, several modules must be compiled and loaded into running kernel\".\nAfter compiling it shows \"Unable to start services.

Alt+Mouse Scroll? Pressing and holding Alt + scrolling with the mouse wheel used to give me a transparent window, is there any way I can get that or something similar in Ubuntu 12.04?\n\nA: Install these packages with the command\nsudo apt-get install compizconfig-settings-manager compiz-plugins-extra\n\nThis will install the CompizConfig-Settings-Manager and necessary plugins required.\nOpen the CompizConfig-Settings-Manager by typing ccsm in the dash. In the CCSM's window, under the Accessibility section, enable the Opacity, Brightness and Satuaration by placing a tick mark on the corresponding checkbox.\n\nThis should automatically enable the plugin, if it does not, press Alt+F2 and type compiz --replace to restart compiz. A nicer way would be logout and login again.\nNow you can increase or decrease the transparency of any window by holding the Alt key and scrolling mouse wheel.\nNote: If Unity seems crashed, don't be bothered. Press Ctrl+Alt+Del to bring logout window, and press Enter to logout from your session. Then login again.\n\nFor Non-Unity users\nUsers who are using Lubuntu or Xubuntu, they will miss this feature because those flavor doesn't use Compiz as the window manager. Lubuntu uses OpenBox and Xubuntu uses XFWM window manager. To be able to use this feature, compiz should be used as the window manager.\nOne way to achieve this is adding a compiz --replace command in startup of the session. (There are neat way of replacing default wm with compiz, but this will do the job)\nAfter enabling compiz, you need to enable some basic plugin using CompizConfig-SettingsManager. These plugins are -\n\n*\n\n*Window Decoration (For decorating windows)\n\n*Animations\n\n*Maximumize (for maximize)\n\n*Move Window (enable moving)\n\n*Place Window (will place new window in suitable place)\n\n*Resize Window (to be able to resize)\n\n*Application Switcher (Alt-Tab functionality)\n\n*Composite\n\n*OpenGL\n\nThese are basics. But you can try others too. I would recommend enabling Scale, Expo, Desktop Wall too.\nAfter enabling these and getting a stable compiz working in your LX/XFCE DE, proceed with the instruction above.\n", "Q: How can I convert .mp4 files to .3gp using ffmpeg?

This makes some (many ?) commands found on sites unusable on ubuntu.\nWhat I did was just get the original ffmpeg:\nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:jon-severinsson/ffmpeg\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get install ffmpeg\n\nnot sure how much this would help you, though\n\nA: In order to get round this problem, the only option may be to build from source. That solved any issues for me. I uninstalled any of the ffmpeg packages currently on the system that I had tried to use, and used this excellent Ubuntu compilation guide. This was the only way I could encode to proprietary formats such as mp4 and mp3. \nIn addition, the following script, which I have modified (credit to the original creator), can again be further altered and used to convert mp4 to 3gp or mp4 to mp3 (to extract the audio), or anything whatsoever. It also preserves the original name of the file in the newly converted file: It is however important to fill in the options correctly. \nYou can use different options for 3gp; for example,you may want a different resolution than qcif (176x144), but I found these settings initially worked for me with my compiled version of ffmpeg. (The conversion may take a while, depending on how powerful your CPU is, as converting it to 3gp reduces the file size quite a lot: 314mb to 13 mb for one of my conversions!) \nSave this script below to a new document and make it executable (chmod +x), place it in the desired folder and execute it; or use the terminal to select the folder the script is in and the target folder containing the files; e.g. ~/Scripts/script ~/Downloads\n#!/bin/bash\nfor f in *.mp4\ndo\n    name=\"${f/.mp4/.3gp}\"\n    ffmpeg -i \"$f\" -vcodec h263 -s qcif -r 15 -b 100k -acodec libfaac -ac 1 -ar 32000 -ab 64k -f 3gp \"$name\"\ndone\n\n", "Q: Problem Creating Bootable USB Drive - v12.04 - Win XP SP3 - Asus Eeepc 901 Just another new guy in town trying to find his way around.\nLet's cut to the chase:\nI got this error after doing what is explained below the screen shot.\n(First time posting a photo link in this manner as well.)\n\nIt says: \"Universal USB Installer 1.8.9.6 Setup\nExtract: error writing to file C:\\DOCUME~1\\CHADM~1.BAL\\LOCALS~1\\Temp\\nse18.tmplpaypal.bmp\"\nI attempted to create a bootable USB drive (16GB SanDisk) using PenDriveLinux to run 12.04 on my Asus EeePC 901 netbook, but didn't have enough hard disk space to download the ubuntu .iso file.\nSo, I popped the USB into my Dell laptop to perform the iso file download.

The -i switch is used so that case is ignored (both upper and lower case results are returned) and -E is invoked so that extended regular expressions can be used:\nzgrep -E -i 'gtk|layout' myfile1.gz myfile2.txt.gz myfile3.Z | less\n\nAs you know, you can use * instead of a filename to select all files in that folder so that grep searches through those. In addition, you could also use the --include=regex and --exclude=regex switches to target certain groups of file names, as is explained in this article here.\nIf you have a look at /bin/zgrep (run cat /bin/zgrep), it is actually just a wrapper script, and all the normal grep command switches are valid when it is invoked. As is noted in the zgrep manpage,\n\nZgrep  invokes grep on compressed or gzipped files.  All options specified are passed directly to grep.  If no file is specified, then the standard input is decompressed if necessary and fed to grep.  Otherwise the given files  are uncompressed if necessary and fed to grep.\n\nFor more information, see man zgrep, man grep and the respective Ubuntu manpages online.\n", "Q: Gnome shell notifications without text \nPossible Duplicate:\nNotifications not working in Gnome 3.4 \n\nI've just changed the theme of my gnome shell.

I have been trying to set up a RDP terminal server on precise using xrdp and have been having significant trouble getting a working configuration. When a user logs on, I need it to connect to that users existing session if it exists, otherwise starting a new session, and any started session must start LXDE. What changes to the default configuration do I need to make in order for this to work?\n\nA: I had this same problem, and I just found an easy solution.  I originally just installed xrdp using the standard proceedure:\napt-get install xrdp\n\nAfter that, its all about your xrdp.ini file, which is located here:\n/etc/xrdp/xrdp.ini\n\nTo open and edit the xrdp's configuration file use:\nsudo nano /etc/xrdp/xrdp.ini\n\nby default the first xrdp session handling script looks like this:\n[xrdp1]\nname=sesman-vnc\nlib=libvnc.so\nusername=ask\npassword=ask\nip=127.0.0.1\nport=-1\n\nThe important line is port=-1, this makes xrdp always look for a free port to connect.  If you set a fixed port here, the xrdp will always go back and connect to the same session.  I changed mine so it looks like this:\n[xrdp1]\nname=customsessionname\nlib=libvnc.so\nusername=myusername\npassword=ask\nip=127.0.0.1\nport=5912\n\nThats it, I think you could get away with just changing the port=-1 to port=5912.  My xrdp always re-connects to existing session always using the same port.\n\nA: Problem is that xrdp does not always connect to the same port. In case it didn't and you forgot the port number, you could login a ssh session and find out the number by\nnetstat -tulpn | grep vnc\n\nand you will get something like the following\ntcp        0      0 127.0.0.1:5911          0.0.0.0:*               LISTEN      5365/Xvnc\n\nand then you know 5911 was the port you connected to.\n\nA: I'd like to improve on an existing answer.  The top voted answer was to edit the xrdp.ini file to change port to a fixed value in place of the -1 wildcard to find an open port.\nI tried that, but got an error connecting the first time, so ended up switching back to the -1 value.  Frustration quickly set in though with the issue remaining of not resuming so I looked at the ini file again.\nWhat worked for me, and was really just something I was curious about was this:\nEdit the /etc/xrdp/xrdp.ini\nUnder [xrdp1] where port=-1 I noticed user name and password were set to ASK. If you set port=ask you will be given the option at the login prompt with username and password to choose a port.\nRather than install additional packages I found the easiest fix to be to set the ask option, connect the FIRST session (if I don't have one running already) on port -1 at the login with username and password.\nAfter disconnecting the session, to resume an existing session always log in on the default port: 5910 and you will resume your existing session until you restart the remote computer or end the session when logging off.\nTo summarize:\n\n\n*\n\n*Edit the xrdp.ini file\n\n*set port = ask\n\n*connect from the remote machine, and at login if you have no existing session, specify port -1\n\n*to resume a session enter the default of 5910\n\nA: on the log in screen with the xrdp box when you first connect to the remote desktop there should be a drop down box, from here choose \"vnc-any\" then input the ip address of the computer and the password but leave the port at what it is, this should help :)\n\nA: If you encountered the problem of \"password failed\", you might take a look at the two issues in GitHub\nReconnect to old vnc session - VNC password failed\nVNC Password failed when picking existing session\nIn short, they mention that specifying port number no longer works in latest design.\n\nA: 1. Modifiy you xrdp.ini:\nsudo vi /etc/xrdp/xrdp.ini\n\n2.Change the port setting port=ask-1 in your connection rule:\n[xrdp1]\nname=sesman-Xvnc\nlib=libvnc.so\nusername=ask\npassword=ask\nip=127.0.0.1\nport=ask-1\n\n3.Restart your xrdp Service\nsudo service xrdp restart\n\n\n\nYou should see the following picture when you login by remote desktop.\n  \n\n1. At first login you can see this port number. Example:5912 :\n\nIf you forget this port number, you can using the following command to check:\nnetstat -peant | grep 59 | grep Xvnc\n\n2. You can re-connect the last session by your port number.\n\n\nRef:\nhttp://c-nergy.be/blog/?p=5305\n\nA: As of Linux Mint/Ubuntu 20, to solve general problems with xrdp I've always found it useful to avoid installing the pre-compiled packages, and building them from source instead.\nNot all the features are enabled in the stock packages: for instance the sound and the clipboard channels have to be explicitly enabled with configure switches, plus the keyboard mapping files are often outdated and some keys like the curly brackets didn't work for me. Most of the problems magically disappeared when I installed the custom compiled version.\nYou might want to compile and install xrdp and xorgxrdp (the xrdp session manager similar to x11rdp), following the instructions here and here, then tweak the /etc/xrdp.ini and /etc/xrdp/sesman.ini files, the latter used by Xorg(xrdp). I recommend disabling dynamic channels in the first one to lower the client and server CPU consumption.\nFor good measure, I use a compiled version of the client too (Remmina), just to make sure that both fit my machines like a glove.\n\nA: I ran into this problem on a Debian machine.  Used X11RDP-o-Matic to build xrdp 0.7 packages.  Prior to upgrading to systemd, xrdp session reconnect worked fine.\nLooking at the process tree I could see that the sessions were no longer children of xrdp-sesman.  Turned out to be a permissions issue when using systemd.  Google found a patch that fixes the problem.\nHow do you identify a working reconnect?  Run ps axf and look at the process tree for xrdp-sesman.  X11rdp, xrdp-chansrv, xrdp-sessvc should all be running as a child.  If they are not, xrdp-sesman will not know how to reconnect to the session.\nHere's what it looks like when working:\n\n\nA: Here's what I did. Make sure tigervnc-server is installed so we can use Xvnc. Launch a VNC session with the default configuration (I actually followed the Arch Linux setup guide for TigerVNC). Then configure your Xrdp to use that VNC session every time. Also set TigerVNC to startup on boot or something. This is the only VNC section in my xrdp.ini file:\n[vnc-any]\nname=vnc-any\nlib=libvnc.so\nip=localhost\nport=5901\nusername=na\npassword=YOURPASSWORD\n#pamusername=asksame\n#pampassword=asksame\n#pamsessionmng=127.0.0.1\n#delay_ms=2000\n\n\nA: If using Windows Remote Desktop Client to connect to a Linux session, I've found that maintaining the same display configuration and color depth will reconnect a user to the same session.  Those parameters can be adjusted by selecting \"Show Options\" at bottom left of the startup screen and then select the \"Display\" tab.\nIf you don't know what your display parameters were of your existing session, start a new session and then from a terminal window run ps axf | grep vnc.  Your display parameters of your existing and new rdp sessions will show something like -geometry 1920x1080 -depth 16.  Make note of these values, logout from your new session and then attempt another xrdp login using your discovered values.\n\nA: This UbuntuForum thread looks useful - I havent tested this myself - however I've copied the solution given here to complete this answer.\nRealVNC setup\n1. Uninstallation of the default Ubuntu VNC server (Vino):\nGo to: System --> Administration --> Synaptic Package Manager \nSearch for the \"Vino\" package, Mark For Removal, Apply. \n2. Installation of TightVNC and XRDP:\nWhile you are using Synaptic Package Manager, seacrh for \"tightvnc\" package (be careful, not \"xtightvnc\") and Mark For Installation. Likewise, search for the \"xrdp\" package and Mark also For Installation. Apply.\nPS: if you want, you may discard any other \"vnc\" package that you don't need!\n3. Configuration of XRDP (Optional)\nOpen a terminal and type the three following commands: \n cd /etc/xrdp\n cp xrdp.ini xrdp.ini.bak \n sudo gedit /etc/xrdp/xrdp.ini\n\nRemove Xrdp2-Xrdp6 sections, leave only the Xrdp1 section.

So this Computer uses a 500 GB 7200rpm SATA Hybrid Hard Drive with 4 GB SSD, so my question is:\nIs it possible to just use the SSD for /boot? Does  it reduce the booting time significantly?\nThx for Answers!!\n\nA: Hybrid Drives using conventinal platters combinded with a (small) SSD have the advantage of using the SSD as a rather large non-volatile and fast cache for improving data transfer rates. Access to this SSD part is done entirely by the hard-disk's firmware.\n\nBecause of this there is no way to partition the drive to exclusively use the SSD as a /boot partition.\n\nNeverthelesss there is some benefit as compared to a conventional drive.

I want merge (union) output from two different commands, and pipe them to a single command.\nA silly example:\nCommands I want to merge the output:\ncat wordlist.txt\nls ~/folder/*\n\ninto:\nwc -l\n\nIn this example, if wordlist.txt contains 5 lines and 3 files, I want wc -l to return 8.\n$cat wordlist.txt *[magical union thing]* ls ~/folder/* | wc -l\n8\n\nHow do I do that?\n\nA: Since wc accepts a file path as input, you can also use process substitution:\nwc -l <(cat wordlist.txt; ls ~/folder/*)\n\nThis roughly equivalent to:\necho wordlist.txt > temp\nls ~/folder/* >> temp\nwc -l temp\n\nMind that ls ~/folder/* also returns the contents of subdirectories if any (due to glob expansion). If you just want to list the contents of ~/folder, just use ls ~/folder.\n\nA: Your magical union thing is a semicolon... and curly braces:\n    { cat wordlist.txt ; ls ~/folder/* ; } | wc -l\n\nThe curly braces are only grouping the commands together, so that the pipe sign | affects the combined output.\nYou can also use parentheses () around a command group, which would execute the commands in a subshell. This has a subtle set of differences with curly braces, e.g. try the following out:\n    cd $HOME/Desktop ; (cd $HOME ; pwd) ; pwd\n    cd $HOME/Desktop ; { cd $HOME ; pwd ; } ; pwd\n\nYou'll see that all environment variables, including the current working directory, are reset after exiting the parenthesis group, but not after exiting the curly-brace group.\nAs for the semicolon, alternatives include the && and || signs, which will conditionally execute the second command only if the first is successful or if not, respectively, e.g.\n    cd $HOME/project && make\n    ls $HOME/project || echo \"Directory not found.\"\n\n\nA: I was asking myself the same question, and ended up writing a short script.\nmagicalUnionThing (I call it append):\n#!/bin/sh\ncat /dev/stdin\n$*\n\nMake that script executable\nchmod +x ./magicalUnionThing\n\nNow you do\ncat wordlist.txt |./magicalUnionThing ls ~/folder/* | wc -l\n\nWhat it does:\n\n\n*\n\n*Send standard input to standard output\n\n*Execute argument. $* returns all arguments as a string. The output of that command goes to script standard output by default.\n\n\nSo the stdout of magicalUnionThing will be its stdin + stdout of the command that is passed as argument.\nThere are of course simpler ways, as per other answers.\nMaybe this alternative can be useful in some cases.\n", "Q: No such file or directory?

There is a bit of guesswork mapping the error messages to package names (tab completion helps).\n\nA: By installing the deb for 32 bit I realized I was missing some libraries (in addition to ia32-libs and libc6). I first solved this problem by giving this command:\nsudo apt-get install -f          \n\nThen I got another error: \nMessage: SDL_GL_LoadLibrary \nError: Failed loading libGL.so.1\n\nObviously, these libraries were properly installed. Without going into details I had to link the libraries by hand. I realized then that could also an easier solution through Synaptic install the following packages:\nlibgl1-mesa-glx:i386\nlibgl1-mesa-dri: i386.\n\nAfter that the next problem was the black screen while playing, which I solved by replacing the executable in /Shank/bin with this:\nhttp://treefort.icculus.org/smb/smb-linux-mesa-hotfix-test.tar.bz2.\nI hope it will be useful to someone.\nIf you need more help or more details please feel free to contact me.\n\nA: You're probably trying to run a 32-bit binary on a 64-bit system that doesn't have 32-bit support installed.\nThere are three cases where you can get the message “No such file or directory”:\n\n\n*\n\n*The file doesn't exist. I presume you've checked that the file does exist (perhaps because the shell completes it).\n\n*There is a file by that name, but it's a dangling symbolic link.\n\n*The file exists, and you can even read it (for example, the command file shank-linux-120720110-1-bin displays something like “ELF 32-bit LSB executable …”), and yet when you try to execute it you're told that the file doesn't exist.\n\n\nThe error message in this last case is admittedly confusing. What it's telling you is that a key component of the runtime environment necessary to run the program is missing. Unfortunately, the channel through which the error is reported only has room for the error code and not for this extra information that it's really the runtime environment that's to blame. If you want the technical version of this explanation, read Getting “Not found” message when running a 32-bit binary on a 64-bit system.\nThe file command will tell you just what this binary is. With a few exceptions, you can only run a binary for the processor architecture that your release of Ubuntu is for. The main exception is that you can run 32-bit (x86, a.k.a. IA32) binaries on 64-bit (amd64, a.k.a. x86_64) systems.\nIn Ubuntu up to 11.04, to run a 32-bit binary on a 64-bit installation, you need to install the ia32-libs package . You may need to install additional libraries (you'll get an explicit error message if you do).\nSince 11.10 (oneiric) introduced multiarch support, you can still install ia32-libs, but you can choose a finer-grained approach, it's enough to get libc6-i386  (plus any other necessary library).\n\nA: To expand on @Gilles answer, there are at least three scenarios resulting in this error:\n\n\n*\n\n*The file doesn't exist.\n\n*The file exists but is a dangling symbolic link.\n\n*The file exists (e.g. file command works), making for a puzzling error message. This may mean there's a problem with the loader.\n\n\nCategories of loader problems:\n\n\n*\n\n*An executable's loader does not exist. You can check this using the file command and see if the loader does exist. E.g.\nfile lmgrd\nlmgrd: ELF 64-bit LSB executable, x86-64, version 1 (SYSV), dynamically linked, interpreter /lib64/ld-lsb-x86-64.so.3, for GNU/Linux 2.6.18, stripped\n\nNotice interpreter /lib64/ld-lsb-x86-64.so.3; if this file does not exist, you need to install it. For this particular loader on 16.04, the answer turned out to be sudo apt-get install lsb.\n\n*Issues with a script's loader (see this answer).\n\n*Missing shared libraries -- use ldd <file-name> to check for any \"not found\" libraries. See this answer for more info.\n\n\nThe loader not existing could be due to a 32/64 bit mismatch or some other reason. There might be other kinds of loader errors I don't know about.\n\nA: This error happens when working on Windows (which introduces extra characters because of different line separator than Linux system) and trying to run this script (with extra characters inserted) in Linux. The error message is misleading.\nIn Windows, the line separator is CRLF (\\r\\n) whereas in linux it is LF (\\n). In my case, this happened due to working on Windows and uploading to Unix server for execution.\n\nA: Google navigated me to this page.

I'd rather have a Global-Menu in LibreOffice than silly new Dash-lenses and DNSMasq and all the other stuff that should NOT have been added to an LTS release.\nWhy doesn't LibreOffice have Global-Menu support yet?\n\nA: The reason for not including global-menu in libreoffice was that there were too many issues remaining and the development team basically ran out of time & resources.\n\nUnfortunately, resource constrains did not allow this to happen, so\n  this was postponed to the quantal release. The planning will be done\n  at UDS-Q beginning of May\n\nFrom this blue-print you can see the open issues:\nhttps://blueprints.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+spec/desktop-p-libreoffice-lo-menubar-polish\nThus - you can install lo-menubar - but it will give you issues as described.\nPossibly the 12.10 release of libreoffice will be available either as a backport or via a PPA and thus global menu integration will be completed ... at this stage this is speculative though.\n\nA: To enable Global Menu for LibreOffice, install lo-menubar , either in the Software Center by  clicking that link, or in the Terminal (Ctrl+Alt+T) by running these commands:\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get install lo-menubar\n\n", "Q: Trash Bin in Unity launcher shows full even when empty I'm having a weird problem where my Trash Bin in Unity launcher is showing full when its not. Usually it wouldn't bother me but its been happening so often lately its getting annoying. Any assistance would be greatly appreciated.\n\nA: I had the same issue. Files that were deleted from a USB drive were causing the Trash to appear full even though it was empty. As soon as I emptied the trash with the USB drive mounted, the trash was cleared.\n\nA: I would just delete the files, and if the bin is still full I would open a Terminal (Ctrl-Alt-T), type \"xkill\" and press enter. This will change the mouse pointer into an X. Hover the mouse over the Unity Dashboard and press the left mouse button. This will kill the dashboard, and one second later it will come back.\nEDIT: The xkill approach will kill the session and the apps running in it and you'll have to login again. It does result in an empty trashcan icon though. (Tested under 14.04): It appears this is a long standing bug with many duplicates see: https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/gnome-applets/+bug/269441\n\nA: The trash on the desktop tries to sum up all the trashes current user can access.\nEach disk, each drive, has got its own trash, sort of speaking.\nSo (desktop) trash staying full after the usb stick is unplugged means :\n\n\n*\n\n*trash has not been emptied while usb stick was plugged in,\n\n*deleted files on that usb stick are still present, they've just been moved to the \"onboard\" .trash folder but not actually deleted.\n\n\nIf that happens just plug in back that usb stick, or external drive, and deleted files will appear again inside the (desktop) trash. Now empty that trash and files from all \"connected\" trashes will be actually deleted.\nIt's not a bug. It's just how trashes work under linux-ubuntu.\n\nA: Found that deleting files from ext-HDD causes the trash bin to be full even though its not. The solution is to move the files you want to delete from external to trash-bin than empty. Or log out and log back in\n", "Q: Is it possible to get the menuing system in (top of screen) 10.04 back after upgrading? \nPossible Duplicate:\nHow to access “Applications” menu in Ubuntu Unity Desktop  \n\nI was changing machines and decided to upgrade from 10.04 to 11.10.  The desktop changed significantly and I don't like the sliding panel on the left side of the screen and would prefer the menu on the top line of the screen from 10.04 (where the Admin, System, etc. utilities could be found).  Is there a way to get this menu back or is it lost forever?\nI'm an intermediate Unix user and any help/insight is appreciated.\n\nA: If you really want to go back to gnome classic, install the gnome-panel package, log out, and select gnome-classic in the lightdm session drop down. See here for more details.\nYou may also like Cinnamon.  It is the default desktop for Linux Mint. There is a ppa for Ubuntu that has packages for 12.04. It has the look and feel of Classic Gnome, but with some nice new features like searchable menus.\nI agree with Sun Dial, though, Unity is really nice once you get used to it. Once you catch the vision you won't look back.\n", "Q: AMD/ATI drivers from website vs. proprietary drivers in Ubuntu 12.04 Repos?

The only time you would want to go either up, or down, is when a specific situation arises.\n", "Q: during final part installation I get the message ' root' not defined go to partioning.

How do i get to partioning menu?\n\nA: Press the super-key (the Windows key) and in the search box type 'Gparted'. This is the partitioning tool. If it doesn't show up, then you need to install it from the Ubuntu Software Centre. Come back to us when you have Gparted working. The fix is easy from there. Good Luck.

Ubuntu 12.04 printer share keeps asking for password and I can't authenticate from any machine. Why??\nWe've installed it in two machine (to act as printer servers) and we get the same problem.\nIt doesn't matter what we do, change or install.

I've done it, but I don't do it every day: it's possible, with subtleties.\nHowever, I've been able to share printers via http and https routes.  The quick description of this method:\n    [US] (= Ubuntu \"Server\")    example IP = 10.0.0.1\n    [WC] (= Windows \"Client\")\n\n\n\n*\n\n*On [US], install a printer, ensuring that it is \"Shared\" via the GUI (e.g. the system-config-printer interface) or manipulation of /etc/cups/ files.\n\n*On [WC], use a web browser and point to CUPS on [US].\ne.g. http://10.0.0.1:631/\nThis should show you the web interface provided by CUPS.  \"CUPS is the standards-based, open source printing system ...\"  This also serves as a test to make sure that the machines can even talk, and that you don't have a more basic problem (e.g. firewall) to solve.\n\n*The upper-right tab on this web page is a link to the Printers list.\n\n*Right-click-and-copy the URL to the printer in question, and you can paste that into the Windows \"Add Printer Wizard\" interface for a network printer.\nAs asked, this should solve the authentication issue by bypassing Samba (CIFS).  However, note that this method allows anyone on your local network to print to the shared printer, and it relies on a stable network IP address for [US].\nIt is also possible to restrict through authentication who can print, but that is for a different question.\n\nA: Seems like bug in Samba in Ubuntu 12.04...\nhttps://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/samba/+bug/967410\n\nA: If you still not get any solution.

As sda is only 4GB, I made a 1GB partition on sdb for /var (along with a partition for swap and /home). I used the desktop i386 iso with unetbootin to load the memory stick. Everything seemed to have worked just fine, and the netbook had been running 11.10 just fine. However, after restarting, I get 3 \"error: no such partition\" errors from grub at the boot menu.\nI've started the machine back up with the memory stick to look around. The latest grub is installed on /dev/sda. (I thought maybe it hadn't \"taken.\") grub.cfg looks right, and the blkids match the internal drives. (I thought maybe the memory stick fooled the grub installer, but it all looks good.) If I open a grub command prompt at the boot menu, and try to do an 'ls', I get more \"error: no such partition\" errors. I even get the message when I try 'help'.\nI'm lost.

That explains why when sda is first in the boot you're able to boot, because only one drive is involved. You should be able to confirm this by running \"ls\" from the working grub on sda, and see that only one drive is listed.\nThe reason that you got \"no such partition\" errors is that all commands in grub are stored in modules, and if a module for a given command hasn't been loaded yet when you try to run the command (like \"help\") grub tries to read $prefix/help.mod. When it turns out that the partition in $prefix doesn't exist, you get this error message. Grub's core.img sometimes has to fit in a very small area and so very few modules are included in it by default, meaning very few commands are available if /boot/grub/ can't be read. The most useful of these commmands are listed here: http://www.gnu.org/software/grub/manual/grub.html#GRUB-only-offers-a-rescue-shell (note that while a simple \"ls\" can function, \"ls -l\" and other options to ls require more modules).\n\nA: I'm as bit suspicious of your swap being on sdb1 ....  I could be wrong, but ....  I've not actually done a system in which the OS is spread over two hard drives as is yours.  Home on a different drive, yes, but swap on a different drive, I'm just not sure.  Especially as the first partition.\nYou might try booting into the 'Try Ubuntu' option on the USB stick and snooping around there.  You could also try re-installing grub from there and updating it.  I'm sure with youre experience you'll know how to do that.\n", "Q: Boot failure with 12.04 install, fixed by upgrading from 10.04 My LG laptop (LGZ1 R200) has been having issues since 11.04. And a clean install of 12.04 was flaky, giving tonnes of disk errors before starting half the time --- with 11.04 and 11.10 it gave errors but always started so I never bothered trying to fix it... \nHowever after backing up and doing a clean install of 12.04 it would not start half the time, froze during boot, never restarting etc...  I tried several installs of 12.04 from several disks then defeated I reverted back to a clean install of 10.04 which works like a charm, and was then able to upgrade from 10.04 to 12.04 and it works, starts, not as quickly as 10.04, but faster than it did with 11.04 or 11.10 and with no disk errors on startup.  \nSo I guess my question is, why will it upgrade, but not install directly, and is that a problem? Is it because 10.04 was pre-Unity? Is it possibly a driver issue? Is it just a question of disk compatibility?  \n\nA: It is impossible to speculate with the sparse information you have given about the nature of the 'freeze during boot'  .... if you tried booting in recovery mode, as I've no doubt you did, what were the error messages?  It is possible that your hardware is in some way below the requirements of 12.04.  Why don't you boot into the live-DVD and use the 'Try Ubuntu' option.  If that works flawlessly then something went wrong during the installation process.  Did you see any errors, and did you use the defaults or manually configure the partitioning as it installed?\n\nA: Sometimes upgrades have slightly different fs layouts and slightly different programs and minute differences from clean installs. But, in any way, looking at the specs of your laptop:\nLG Z1 (XNote R200)\nSpecs\nIntel Core 2 Duo T7300 (2.0 GHz), \n1 GB RAM, \n160GB HDD, \n12.1-inch screen (1280 x 800 pixels), \nATI Radeon HD 2400, \nBluetooth, \nWLAN, \nThat 1 gig of ram there looks very close to minimum for unity. Try running unity-2d or maybe xfce/gnome3 for a better experience. But, I dont know about the freaky filesystem issues. Maybe unity crashing on your machine is causing corruption???\n", "Q: A well-supported wireless PCI adapter for Ubuntu 12.04? I need a PCI wireless adapter that works well with Ubuntu 12.04.

I would like to know if it is possible to use these full installs, after a bit of configuration, to be used as installers to create new installations on others' computers without copying my configuration or passwords, and without affecting my system during the installation. That is, I want to create new installations, without changing my configuration to that of the new system, and having those installations be very similar to those created by the ones created by regular media. \nSorry if unclear or mistagged, and feel free to edit.\nEdit: Also, remastersys does not work for me  and this is not a duplicate: I need to install from booting my full installation on another system and then installing from there, not making another Live CD, which I am trying to avoid.\nEdit: I am doing this to have a better demo system that works fully, and does not suffer the issues of a live CD.

What it explains is how to get Ubuntu on your laptop too give you a file listing what's installed, and then to use that list on another PC to install the exact same software. I may have misunderstood your question though!

I had a chroot'ed copy of the live CD filesystem(From the squashfs) and by using ubiquity in the fake root, I have installed to other target systems. Also, a short shell script helps automate entering the fake-root and running ubiquity. The main thing to avoid is accidentally overwriting your old install on the external HDD.\n", "Q: How to install Own Cube on 12.04 Ok I wanted to install OwnCube (www.owncube.com) on my Ubuntu 32 bit 12.04 desktop.

Personalised Login Screen\nYou'll get personalised login screen automatically when you'll change your desktop wallpaper (use something other than the default wallpaper). Your desktop wallpaper will automatically be used as your login screen background.\n\nA: Also, I never was a fan of upgrades. Sometimes they simply break your system, sometimes leave out features, and sometimes are just plain dumb. Next time try a clean install. Generally installing clean leaves you with a better boot time, better response, and guaranteed speed.\n\nA: I had this same issue with backgrounds not showing up on the login screen.  However, the problem only occurred when I tried to use files I transferred from a back-up external harddrive.  It turns out it is simply a permissions issue.  If you copied files from another location, they may only be user/group readable (but not other/world readable).  Since the global login screen doesn't have your personal permissions, it cannot access the background images unless they are world readable (don't make them world writable though).\nSo find the background(s) you want to use, and then change their permissions as so:\nchmod o-r [some file with bad permissions]\nThis will hopefully resolve your login screen issue.\n", "Q: How obtain error message when exporting data from LibreOffice Base to Calc and freezing occurs?

Since migrating to a true install and upgrading to 12.04 I have had several problems that seem to relate to the Ubuntu Software Center. Hanging at applying changes and blank screen on screen lock only when it is running, for instance.\nMy question is: Can I safely uninstall and reinstall Ubuntu Software Center and could this possibly fix those problems or are they just bugs I have to wait for updates for?\n\nA: You can uninstall and reinstall the Software Center with a single command. This also resets any of its systemwide configuration files to their defaults.\nsudo apt-get --purge --reinstall install software-center\n\nIf you want to get a newer version of the Software Center if there's one available as an update, make sure to run sudo apt-get update first (as you'd usually do when installing any software from the Terminal).\nAs for whether or not this will fix the problem, sometimes it does, and sometimes it doesn't. It depends on specifically what is wrong. I recommend removing user-specific Software Center configuration files as well:\ncd ~/.config; rm -r software-center\n\nIf the problems persist, I recommend reporting a bug.\n\nA: Press  CTRL+ALT+T  simultaneously to enter terminal.\nTo uninstall Software Center:\n\n\n*\n\n*sudo apt-get remove software-center\n\n*sudo apt-get autoremove software-center\nTo re-install Software Center: \n\n\n*\n\n*sudo apt-get update\n\n*sudo apt-get install software-center\n\nA: Your problem might not be exactly the software center, it doesn't manage and if the problem is settings level it will NOT revert when you update the application, you may likely remove the problematic app but instead of apt-get remove you will have to use apt-get purge which will also remove the configuration files from your computer, the you'll have to reinstall the application and that should solve the problem\n", "Q: Facebook.com redirecting to SearchMagnified.com Please need urgent help.I'm on Ubuntu 12.04 and using chromium browser latest build.When ever I go for facebook.com on my browser it redirecting me to SearchMagnified.com.

If you installed the Ubuntu bootloader on the second HDD and your computer boots from the first partition , first, it will come across Windows before it comes across the bootloader, meaning it will not give you the opportunity to choose. You should set it to boot from your second HDD first, which should lead you to the bootloader, which will give you your choice of OS.

Which is great, except that Ubuntu uses it natively, and prevents some of the button presses from getting through to Myth.  For example, I can send a button from the remote that equates to Ctrl-Alt-A (which I assume Ubuntu isn't interested in), and then trap that in Mythfrontend, but the remote's Play button is caught by Ubuntu (which displays a large circle with a line though it, as there's no media player loaded).\nI understand that this is because lirc is merged into the kernel now, and I like that.\nWhat I've done so far:\nFound the device using lsusb:  \n$ lsusb  \nBus 001 Device 004: ID 073a:2230 Chaplet Systems, Inc. infrared dongle for remote\n\nFound the event device number:  \n$ cat /proc/bus/input/devices  \nI: Bus=0003 Vendor=073a Product=2230 Version=0110\nN: Name=\"HID 073a:2230\"\nP: Phys=usb-0000:00:1a.0-1.2/input0\nS: Sysfs=/devices/pci0000:00/0000:00:1a.0/usb1/1-1/1-1.2/1-1.2:1.0/input/input5\nU: Uniq=\nH: Handlers=sysrq kbd mouse1 event5 js0 \nB: PROP=0\nB: EV=10001f\nB: KEY=4c37fff072ff32d bf54445600000000 ffffffffff 30c100b17c007 ffa67bfad951dfff febeffdfffefffff fffffffffffffffe\nB: REL=343\nB: ABS=100030000\nB: MSC=10\n\nTested the input with evtest (I pressed Play):  \n$ sudo evtest /dev/input/event5  \nInput driver version is 1.0.1\nInput device ID: bus 0x3 vendor 0x73a product 0x2230 version 0x110\nInput device name: \"HID 073a:2230\"\nSupported events:\n  Event type 0 (EV_SYN)\n  Event type 1 (EV_KEY)\n    Event code 1 (KEY_ESC)\n    Event code 2 (KEY_1)\n    Event code 3 (KEY_2)\n    Event code 4 (KEY_3)\n    Event code 5 (KEY_4)\n    Event code 6 (KEY_5)\n    Event code 7 (KEY_6)\n<------------snipped lots of 'Event code' lines------------>\nTesting ...

Learning something new is also worthwhile!\n\n\nMy guess:\nI'm assuming that this will require using setkeycodes, but have had trouble finding enough information to configure this.  \nAny help greatly appreciated!\n\nA: Remote's Play button is consumed by media-keys plugin for gnome-settings-daemon. To disable it and allow MythTV receiving the event, do:\n$ gsettings set org.gnome.settings-daemon.plugins.media-keys active false\n\nAlso you will want to disable/uninstall xfce4-volumed to prevent it from trapping XF86AudioLowerVolume, XF86AudioRaiseVolume and XF86AudioMute.\nYou may want to re-map some window manager keys too (e.g. in my case Ctrl+Alt+D is used to start Live TV, while xfwm4 uses that for show_desktop action). This can be done in \"Settings > Window Manager\", \"Keyboard\" tab.\nAdditionally you can enable the \"Mouse\" control to send keyboard events using the mythtv-mouse2kbd.py script I described in my blog post.\n\nA: I've just been down a similar path of discovering the new in-kernel lirc, for me the ah ha moment was when I realized an ir remote is now just another keyboard. \nAs an alternative to showkey/evtest you can run sudo ir-keytable -t to detect remote button presses.  Though I don't think it offers too much new information.  \nTo adjust the mapping of remote scancodes to keys, you need create your own config file based off one from /lib/udev/rc_keymaps/.\nUsing the evtest output you can use KEY_X  and value fields to help identify which rc_keymaps file is being used.  Copy that matching file and edit to remap the keys as you desire. You can load your modified configuration with sudo ir-keytable -c -w newfile. Now you can test your new configuration with evtest.\nIf you can't get enough flexibility from modifying the keymaps you can still use the the userspace lirc daemon.  You can configure lircd to pull from the in-kernel driver and then configure lircd as normal.\nThese two links, http://forum.xbmc.org/showthread.php?tid=104541 and \nhttp://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=1754719, have lots of information about how to configure and debug either setup.\n", "Q: Python gzip fails on Ubuntu 11.04 This function is based on the Python sample code @ http://docs.python.org/library/gzip.html.

I have absolutely no experience with Linux, and I desperately need to get my computer back up and running again with Windows.\nHow do I remove Ubuntu and reinstall Windows?\n\nEditor's note: many of the answers are about removing Ubuntu from dual-boot but keeping Windows (which is a bit complicated), while other answers are about removing Ubuntu from single-boot (which is easy: basically just format the disk while installing Windows). The question as written is ambiguous between dual-boot or single-boot.\n\nA: The way to \"delete\" Ubuntu is to delete the partition it's using. That will make the partition available for reformatting and use in another OS.\nIf you can still run Windows, use its disk manager to delete the Ubuntu partition.  You could then format it to use in Windows, or expand an existing partition.\nYou can also boot the Ubuntu LiveCD and choose the \"Try Ubuntu\" option.  After it loads, find and run gparted and remove the partition.\nIf Windows and Ubuntu are both gone and you want to reinstall Windows, you can repartition and reformat during the installation.\n\nA: *\n\n*Boot a live CD/DVD/USB with Ubuntu\n\n*Choose \"Try Ubuntu\"\n\n*Download and install OS-Uninstaller.\n\n*Start the software and select what operating system you want to uninstall.\n\n\n*Apply\n\n*When all is over, reboot your computer, and voila, only Windows is on your computer or of course no OS!\n\n\nA: You need to restore the MBR that was overwritten by grub when you installed ubuntu.  In the old days, you ran fdisk /MBR on your system disk.  The way to do it in Windows XP is to run the \"Windows Recovery Console\" which can be run from the installation disk or installed to the hard drive and run from there.\nThe instructions for installing the Recovery Console are here:  http://support.microsoft.com/?kbid=314058\nHowever, since you don't have the CD you'll need to try installing it from what you have already.  Open up the run dialogue (win+r, or start->run) and enter this:\n%windir%\\i386\\winnt32.exe /cmdcons\n\nThen you will have to reboot into windows and select the recovery console while it's booting.  From there you will need to run FIXMBR which is documented here:  http://www.microsoft.com/resources/documentation/windows/xp/all/proddocs/en-us/bootcons_fixmbr.mspx\nOnce this is done successfully, your computer will boot straight into windows again.\n\nA: If you're into paid software I highly recommend Acronis.  Paragon is also good.  It has a lot of interesting options.  It allows you to do everything you need to in order to do this.  The order of operations is:\n\n\n*\n\n*Get live media that will let you perform all these operations without an OS or MBR backup. See acronis link.\n\n*Delete the Ubuntu partitions (probably anything that's not NTFS or FAT32)\n\n*Resize your windows partition to fill the disk\n\n*Apply changes and possibly reboot depending on which version of which software you have\n\n*Run the 'fix boot problems' wizard in Acronis.  It's magic.  \n\n\nAlternately, you could use supergrubdisk.  Directions on their wiki include screenshots and step by step directions.\n\nA: You can go into the Disk Management utility and delete the Ubuntu partition.

Now, your computer wont boot (\"no such partition\") and you lack a Windows Recovery CD to fix it.\n\n\n\n*\n\n*Create a Ubuntu LiveCD/USB.\n\n*Boot from your Ubuntu LiveCD/USB by selecting it in the BIOS boot options.\n\n*Once Ubuntu loads, open a Terminal (Ctrl+Alt+T), and run these commands:\nsudo apt-get install lilo\nsudo lilo -M /dev/sda\n\nNote: you may have to replace /dev/sda with the main hard drive you installed Ubuntu and Windows to.\n\n*You can then reboot into Windows.\n\n\nA: If you have a single-boot system with only Ubuntu installed, you can install Windows directly and override Ubuntu completely. To remove Ubuntu from a Ubuntu/Windows dual boot system, you will first need to replace the GRUB bootloader with the Windows bootloader. Then, you would need to remove the Ubuntu partitions.\nThe first step can be done with a Windows Recovery DVD/Installation DVD or a Ubuntu Live DVD. If you have a newer Dell laptop (such as the Dell Inspiron), you would need to do so by changing the boot sequence in the UEFI settings, which will be discussed later.\nUsing Windows Recovery or Installation Media\nIf you don't have a Windows recovery or installation media, you can download official ISO files for Windows 10, Windows 8, or Windows 7 from the Microsoft Download Center and burn them on a DVD or a USB drive. Windows will only install as an evaluation copy for 30 days without a genuine product key.\n\n\n*\n\n*Grab a Windows recovery or installation media and boot from it.  You should see this or a similar screen on a recovery media.  \n\nYou should see this on an installation media.  Click \"Repair your computer\" and you should see a screen like the first image.\n\n\n*Open the Command Prompt, then type bootrec /fixmbr into the Command Prompt.\n\n\n*Reboot and boot into Windows.  Then follow the steps below to remove the Ubuntu partitions.\n\nUsing a Ubuntu Live DVD and Boot Repair\nIf you don't have a Windows recovery CD or you are constrained to download and burn the ISO files mentioned before, you can use Boot-repair.  It is a tool that fixes most boot problems(Windows or Ubuntu).  I suggest using a Windows CD if possible.\n\n\n*\n\n*Boot from a Ubuntu Live DVD or USB\n\n*Type these lines in the terminal one line at a time.\nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:yannubuntu/boot-repair\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get install boot-repair\n\n\n*Search for Boot-Repair in the Dash and launch it.\n\nTo fix your computer with Boot-repair, simply click the \"Recommended Repair\" button.  Then follow the steps below to remove the Ubuntu Partitions.\n\nChanging the Boot Sequence in the UEFI settings of a Dell computer\nNewer Dell laptops like the Dell Inspiron requires the bootloader order to be changed directly in the UEFI settings. This can be done with the following steps.\n\n\n*\n\n*Pressing F12 when the Dell logo appears.\n\n*Go to General → Boot Sequence. Under the Boot Sequence section, select Ubuntu, then click Delete Boot Option.\n\n*Reboot your computer.\n\n\n\nDeleting Ubuntu Partitions\nAfter the previous steps, your computer should boot directly into Windows.\n\n\n*Go to Start, right click Computer, then select Manage.  Then select Disk Management from the sidebar.\n\n\n*Right-click your Ubuntu partitions and select \"Delete\". Check before you delete!\n\n*Then, right-click the partition that is on the Left of the free space.  Select \"Extend Volume\".  Go through the Wizard and Finish it.\n\n\n*Done!\nNote from Tanner: If you are using an extended partition, you might have to remove the big extended partition to make the space unallocated.\n\nA: Actually the solution to this is very easy, anyone can do it. First things first. Download something called EasyBCD (there's a free version, you have to download it into Windows as it's a .exe) http://neosmart.net/download.php?id=1 run through the set-up.\n\n*\n\n*Launch EasyBCD and go to the sixth button down, EasyBCD deployment. Since you're a Windows XP user, select Write the Windows XP Bootloader to the MBR then press the big red button called \"Write to MBR\"\n\n\n*Next head up to the second button called \"Edit boot Menu\" and select the first option \"Skip the boot menu\" and click save settings. Congrats, you now have Windows XP bootloader back, and it will automatically boot into Windows, but we aren't done yet. You still have Ubuntu on your system, we want to change that.\n\n\n*Open up disk management and find your Ubuntu partition and the Ubuntu Swap Partition (I assume you know how big it is, [the swap is about two gigs, should be right next to the Linux partition]). Delete the swap first, and then delete the Ubuntu partition. If done properly you will get Unaccounted space for HD and the swap will become \"Free Space\" time to also fix that.\n\n\n*Next right click on the Free-Space partition (swap space) and delete it again, it should become part of the unaccounted space. Now you don't want to just leave all that empty space on your HD. Right click on your Windows partition now, and click extend the volume. It should default into the maximum size of your HD, (which you want so XP has all the space.) and click continue. There you go, it'll do it's thing and Windows XP should now have your entire HD, Ubuntu will be gone, and you Will have the XP bootloader back. Hope that helped for you!\n(Video tutorial from Tech-Harvest doing basically the same thing but on Windows 7 - http://youtu.be/AAWBZq04Izc )\n\nA: Boot from a live Ubuntu media and wipe the partition table (and MBR) out with dd if=/dev/zero of=/dev/sdY bs=512 count=1 where Y is the drive. this will be /dev/sda in a single drive system. This command will blast the first sector of the drive full of zeros eliminating the partition table. Install the new OS you want to install as if the drive were new.\nNote: you may have to increase the bs (block size) or count factors on a GPT disk. I haven't been able to find exact numbers but changing count to 8 or bs to 4096 should do the trick.\n\nA: How to put Windows back on HDD Starting with Ubuntu only\nThe question sounds to me like there is no Windows on the OP's hard drive.\nMost, if not all, of the above answers depend on Windows being installed.\nHere are two methods of installing Windows starting with only a Ubuntu install or Live USB\nInstalling Windows using mkusb-plug\n\n*\n\n*Install mkusb: Can I install mkusb in Ubuntu live USB?

To get rid of that, I had to do the following in an advanced command prompt: \nDiskpart\nList disk            (Note which disk is your System drive number. Mine was 2)\nSel disk 2\nList vol               (Note which volume is the EFI partition mine is 4)\nSel vol 4\nassign letter=V:       (or any other unassigned letter)\nExit\n\nThen navigate into that directory: \nV:\ncd EFI\ndir               (to see what is in there. I had neon and ubuntu in the list) \nrmdir /S ubuntu\nrmdir /S neon \n\nAnd restart! Make note of whatever other directory in there that might be linux related and delete them. I initially didn't know neon was a Linux Flavour (I received my husband's old laptop, I didn't install these) and that caused further headaches as my computer kept restart in the grub terminal. \n\nA: I ran into this because I was giving away my old dual boot laptop and reset all drives with the Windoz reset menu option.  However, it left Ubuntu and grub untouched to my surprise.  So then I deleted the Ubuntu Partition and got stuck.  I did not have luck with several of the answers posted in an older related post.\nHowever, I was able to fix this with no command lines.\nI opened up the bios and changed the boot order to Windows Boot Manager.\nChanging the boot order totally ignores grub and solved all of my problems. Windows boots fine with no command line fixes.  I'll have to remember this as a temporary setting when I'm updating Windows so I don't have to babysit the laptop when it \"reboots several times\"\n", "Q: Security Issues from Torrent Downloading I am a new Ubuntu user (using it since last 1 month). When I was with windows there were all these Internet Security Suites that protected the PC.\nWith Ubuntu there aren't any. I wanted to know if I download torrents, will someone be able to hack into my system?\nSince all the peers can see my IP address, will they be able to break into my system?\nI know the question sounds n00bish, but then I am a n00b.\nPS: Ubuntu and Transmission are all up to date in my system.\n\nA: Nothing is hack-proof but you're safer than the average Windows PC.\nI assume you are connecting via a router. In that case the router will probably block everything incoming except stuff on the bittorrent ports so unless they have an exploit in transmission (which would be specific to transmission) you are probably safe.\nBTW consumer grade windows firewalls won't help you either in this situation. Since you are actually requesting bittorrent traffic, the firewalls aren't going to block it. Some of the smarter windows AV might detect and try to block them after they get in, or might flag some suspicious traffic patterns, but that's a different story ... :-)\n", "Q: Can't edit file in emacs without sudo I have lubuntu 12.04, and I installed emacs using:\nsudo apt-get install emacs\n\nWhenever I try to edit/make a file, however, nothing shows up unless I run it under sudo.

I learnt that the \"i\" stands for \"i - the package will be installed.\" What's the meaning of \"will be installed\", please?\n\nA: With aptitude you first mark what you want to have done, and then you proceed to do it. For example you might press the find a package you want to install and then press the \"+\" key. Assuming the package isn't currently installed the first two flags then will be pi, meaning the package is either purged or never installed, and is to be installed.  \nTo actually install it, you press the g key and aptitude will proceed to install it.  \nIf you change your mind before you do that you can \"Cancel pending actions\" in the Actions menu and anything you had marked for installation or update will be unmarked. There are menus and reminders about what keys do what on the top of the aptitude program's display.\nThe synaptics program has a similar approach but has a real gui and may be easier to use.\nThe other approach is to use the ubuntu software center to install software and the update-manager to keep it up to date. They do things more immediately.\n", "Q: Can my machine run Ubuntu( kubuntu | xubuntu | mint ) 12.04 WELL? I have a 9 year old computer packing the hardware listed below.\nMy question is, can I run 12.04 ( Ubuntu, Kubuntu, MINT or Xubuntu ) WELL?\nI was running Ubuntu 10.10 and I upgraded to 12.04 by going through each release via the update manager:  11.04 -> 11.10 ->12.04\nDuring the installation process for 12.04 I saw an error message that there was an error installing and setting up part of the kernel.  Later, when I tried installing a package in synaptic, I got another error message mentioning the kernel.  When I rebooted, I got told somehting about my video and graphics was not configured properly and that I would have to do it manually ( like I know ).  It gave me the option to enter the system in low graphics mode, but it just hanged.\nI had an old livecd of Xubuntu 10.10 around so I used that to get into my computer and copy data over to an external hard drive.\nI think tried to install Xubuntu 10.10 from the livecd, with the option \"download updates\" checked.  The install process moved along a bit, then halted for about 5 hours.\nI rebooted my machine and tried the Xubuntu 10.10 installer WITHOUT the option to \"download updates\".  The install completed in about 15 minutes.\nSo, all of that is making me wonder if there is someting about 12.04 that does not like my hardware.   I'm willing to try again, but only if I know I will not have to spend hours just to get to an error message and a hosed up system like I did last night.\nI also think I have a lot more RAM than is being reported in the output below.\nI had extra ram installed last year.

I'm guessing that led to a large part, if not all of my upgrade problems.\nMy system was running Ubuntu 10.10, which had updates turned off and support withdrawn this year.\nI thought Unity was cool. However, I don't have a wide screen monitor and I'm doing more development at home these days. Learning new habits while programming would likely drive me bats right now since I am so busy.\nSo between the issue of Unity being very different and 12.04 not liking my hardware I decided not to upgrade to Ubuntu 12.04, but do a clean install of XUbuntu 11.10 instead.\nI'm enjoying the simplicity of XUbuntu. Support for 11.10 only lasts until 2013 April. My computer will be 10 years old as of March that year.\nAt that point 1 of 3 things might happen:\n\n\n*\n\n*the Nvidia support issue with 12.04 will be resolved \n\n*I will buy a new PC with new hardware that will be supported\n\n*I will go Mac\n\n\nEither way the problem will be solved and as for right now I am back in business at home with a minimum of hassle.\n\nA: Yes it will work. Just to give you an idea, if I am running right now Ubuntu 12.04 using Unity 3D) in a Lenovo 3000 N200 laptop that has about 4 times less graphics than yours and a LOT slower CPU than you then you can be sure 12.04 will run smoothly on your PC.\nIn my case here to give you an idea it is an Intel Celeron M540 (You just read it right. A CELERON!) with an Intel video card. The only thing I changed was the HDD from the 80GB that it came with to a 120GB. The rest is the same thing and is running Unity with no problems. Obviously in Unity 2D it runs even better but this is just to give you a point.\nIn your case you have an Nvidia card so you should feel it even smoother and with the update to the Nvidia drivers today it will run even better.\nYou have more than enough memory (In my case I only have 1GB RAM) and a good CPU for it.\nIf you even want to try it out without installing it, run the Live CD and test drive Ubuntu 12.04 for a while.\n\nA: Higher spec than one of my servers.

Okay, before I get into the guts of it, I'm vastly aware that Gtk and Qt are marvelous frameworks from which to work with. In fact, I have no qualms with either.\nThat being said, does anyone know of any ongoing projects by which X11/Xlib are to be completed libraries? Sadly, I ask this is a former Windows-Only Developer. In Win32 API, everything from the basic window to dialog boxes are covered in same API level. Whereas, under Linux basic windows, anti-alias fonts, hardware interaction are all independent libraries. Dialog boxes are still, by and large, self constructed.\nAnd if there are no projects looking to complete X11, does anyone know of any resources by which a person could understand the fundamentals to embark on such a project?\n\nA: I'd have to say the answer to your question is \"No\". By their underlying philosophy and design, Xlib will never attempt to provide everything under one API. So in that sense Xlib is \"complete\", in that it does what it's supposed to do, and it leaves other higher-level concerns up to other layers.\nThe Windows approach where \"everything from the basic window to dialog boxes are covered in same API level\" is not necessarily the best one, and the one taken on Linux is just different, stemming from the architectural and design choices made for the X Window system. I've read a lot about the Windows API being very complex and inconsistent, so it looks like unifying things under one API may not be the best solution. And indeed, it detracts from the flexibility you have if libraries and APIs each have well-delimited concerns and functionalities. What if I want hardware interaction in a non-GUI program? What if I need to render antialiased images and fonts to a file without having a graphical environment running? Having independent libraries enables this sort of thing.\nYou could read Linux is Not Windows for a much better rationale on why you shouldn't expect Linux to mimic Windows, and the X Window System Overview HOWTO for a slightly outdated but still quite valid explanation on the philosophy behind X and the toolkits. libraries and desktop environments that work atop it.\n", "Q: 'Cloning' Ubuntu to my other PC? I searched here and see mention of Clonezilla and Remastersys - but nothing I found answered my question completely, so I ask:\nMy home PC is just a generic one, and now that I changed it to Ubuntu I really love how it's come out and how it runs better !\nMy office PC is a different generic set of hardware, and I'd like to 'clone' the exact same setup to it but not have to repeat all the tweaking and such that I did already.\nIs there a program that will allow me to replicate/install my already customized setup from one to the other, easily ?\nAre there certain steps I must make before doing something like that so it'll be compatible with different hardware ?\nThanks !\n\nA: You can't be sure 100% that they'll work since it's different hardware, but here comes the interesting part Ubuntu will load the correct Modules for the hardware its running so the only thing you can do is just, try it and see if it works, now the configuration files are in your home folder under several hidden folders (.config for example).\nA personal experience on this: I had a Core2Duo, MSi Intel motherboard and an AMD GPU running Ubuntu 11.04, when the time arrived I upgraded to an AMD PII x6, AMD Mb and the AMD GPU, luckily Ubuntu worked for me so, as i said.. try it.\n\nA: I tried CloneZilla and it failed to complete; searching for the error it threw proved to be a waste of my time...\nMoved on to Remastersys and found that it is so primitive and lacking in options as to be useless; meaning that it cannot be told WHAT & WHERE to back up...feh.\nThe best solution I've found:\nRedo Backup (here)- holy cow is this great !!!\nI was able to make my backup to my USB stick in an amazingly short period of time, and restored it quickly as well - if there's anything else equal or better than Redo Backup I'd love to hear of it, but for now I am very, very satisfied.\n\nA: I've successfully moved Ubuntu installations to different hardware several times. Typically I would image the drive(s) as described here. There are however, some caveats. It's been my experience that difficulties can arise if the video and networking hardware are too different.\n\nA: Ancient thread, I know - but as this is a forever needed function I am adding info here from my own experiences in the years since the OP.\nTo resume here I must 1st mention that the best of what I've found & used taught me to stick with EXT3 as an important part of the process (and frankly I've seen nothing that has made me change that choice...).\n2 backup options have served me well most of the time between my additions here:\nA - Systemback\nB - Macrium Reflect\nDetails pertinent to the above:\nSystemback required some digging & learnings both to get it up & running on Ubuntu Mate 18.04 - and to learn its foibles.\nThat having been done, it is amazingly excellent for cloning an entire system & I've used it for that many times already with 100% success.\nIts single limitation is that for backups over 4GB it will not make an ISO, so those must be written to a USB stick - which is great anyhow as it makes a terrifically usable boot media that does both live and installable sessions.\nReflect is ONLY used via boot media as it is winpe3, but it does handle up to EXT3 for me without fail - with the only possible problem afterwards of sometimes needing to also use Boot Repair Disk to correct GRUB2.\n(It also takes WAY longer to boot up than just using the already installed Systemback...)\nVery important to mention here is the reincarnation of ReDo !!\nI have gotten it & made a boot media from it, but have yet to test & verify it for myself - so, it is definitely very happy news for it to be back, but please also remember - YMMV.\nBack when I posted the above answer I did truly adore ReDo Backup, it was so easy & simple & it just worked.\nThen, after the days of Ubuntu 12.04 it was abandoned.\nNow, at long last it has been brought back from the dead - YAY !!!\nFor anyone interested, have a look at these pages:\nHome page=>\nhttps://github.com/rescuezilla/rescuezilla\nFAQ=>\nhttps://rescuezilla.com/help.html\nLimitations=>\nhttps://github.com/rescuezilla/rescuezilla/wiki/Rescuezilla-Limitations\nRelease =>\nhttps://github.com/rescuezilla/rescuezilla/releases/download/1.0.5.1/redobackup-livecd-1.0.5.1.iso\n(From https://github.com/rescuezilla/rescuezilla/releases ) \nMy own cloning process goes this way:\nI have taken my time to create a tweaked up version of 18.04.3, backed it up with Systemback - and transferred it with 100% success to a bunch of desktop as well as notebook PCs with various h/w.\nSome were 100% new & just built (bare metal...), some were bought bearing the abortion called '10' which was sanitized away 1st (without ever even getting booted up to it), and the cloned system has been dropped into older h/w as well - and just works.\nPlease bear in mind that my solution INCLUDES the home partition which has NOT been used to store any personal data before the cloning process so that all settings in there are reproduced - which makes the outcome arrive as a system that takes very little time to finish setting up per-user.\nI hope all of this added info will be helpful for other folks here !!\n", "Q: Wireless network cannot be enabled for Sony VAIO E series I cannot use the wireless network from my Sony VAIO E series laptop.

The thing is that I had a dual boot (win 7 and ubuntu 11. something) installed with Wubi for a long time and it worked perfectly. Now the problem is that I updated ubuntu to 12.04 LTS and I can only work with ubuntu. When restarting the computer I can see the boot options (win 7 and ubuntu) but if I choose to boot win 7, it begins to load and then it restarts. What can I do? I use a Dell 1520 vostro. Thanks in advance.\n\nA: If you are dual-booting and NOT using Wubi:\nThats what I got once into. I too had the same problem you are having. Its nothing but a damaged MBR. You just need to do two things:1.  Repair the MBR2. Re-install the grub. For step 1, visit here and see how to repair MBR as explained in the best way I could.You will then get your window working and you will not be asked any operating system to boot into at the startup. Now next step (re-installing the GRUB) is to do that. You need to re-install the GRUB to have the same choice of the operating system. Just follow the next explained step.STEP2: Boot into ubuntu with any live cd, and just go to the terminal and type following:\n$sudo fdisk -l\n.....list of /dev/sda \nNote down the device name containing the root partition of your installed ubuntu, in my case it was /dev/sda2\n......\n$sudo mkdir /mnt/myfolder\n$sudo mount /dev/sda2 /mnt/myfolder\n$sudo grub-install --root-directory /mnt/myfolder /dev/sda\n\nAnd you are done.

Graphics card is a Radeon 6800 which has DVI out to 1st monitor, HDMI out to receiver which the TV gets it's Audio/Video. Audio is always via my receiver sound.\nThings work fine as long as it boots with the TV and Receiver on.\nTurn off the TV and BART's HDMI audio will go away, and the HDMI option vanishes from the sound menu. I had an occasional HDMI issue with 11.10 but turning on/off the TV would fix the sound.\nHow can I hardcode things so that it always uses HDMI out of audio?\nI suspect the TV is sending a signal upon that 12.04 is now listening for.\nTurning the TV back on does NOT resolve this, and I'd suggest having the ability to override this new \"feature\" via sound menu.\n\nA: I've been having this problem. I couldn't find a decent fix, but I have this work around. Note that it's a horrid hack but it does the job for me until the root problem is fixed -- hopefully it will help someone else. Every 5 seconds it checks dmesg for HDMI connection errors and if it finds one it restarts the connection.\nI made this watchdog script -- replace \"DFP1\" with the name of your output (get it from xrandr).\n#!/usr/bin/env python\nimport os\nimport time\n\nvalid = \"ELD_Valid=1\"\ninvalid = \"ELD_Valid=0\"\n\ndef executeCommand(the_command):\n    temp_list = os.popen(the_command).read()\n    return temp_list\n\ndef getDMESG():\n    return executeCommand(\"dmesg | grep -i hdmi | tail -n 10\")\n\ndef needsRefresh():\n    list = getDMESG();\n    valid_index = list.rfind(valid)\n    invalid_index = list.rfind(invalid)\n    if invalid_index > valid_index:\n        return True\n    else:\n        return False\n\ndef doTest():\n    if needsRefresh() == True:\n        os.popen(\"xrandr -display :0 --output DFP1 --off; xrandr -display :0 --output DFP1 --auto\").read()\n\nwhile True:\n    doTest()\n    time.sleep(5)\n\nIf anyone knows a better way to detect the error (with catalyst drivers), please let me know. (With the opensource drivers I think you could trigger the reset bit of the code on drm acpi events if you wanted to do some scripting).\nI start it by adding this to /etc/rc.local: (change \"xbmc\" to the user name that you log in as)\nsu xbmc -c 'python /home/USERNAME/src/check_hdmi.py &'\n\n\nA: In the meantime while the bug report gets a good going over, I've noticed a quick button combination that will save a few headaches.\nSimply pull out into a tty and back to your GUI:\nCTRL + ALT + F1  (or anything from F1 to F6)\nthen\nCTRL + ALT + F8 (you might need to use F7 instead of F8. One of them will return you to your desktop, the other will give you a black screen and a cursor)\nIt seems sync is re-established when returning to the GUI.\nThis is far quicker than logging out and back in, and you're programs etc. remain open.\nButton combination. Done. Hassle free.\nThis of course isn't a fix. It's just a quick keyboard combination to trick the HDMI to re-sync and thus get the audio back.\nIt works on my end.\nAnyone else want to turn their TV off for a second and try it themselves?\n\nA: I noticed that if you turn off the output to the TV and turn it back on it also resets the sound (Radeon HD6670).  The aticonfig commands set the display to fill the screen on my TV.  You need to find out your output name by running \"xrandr -q\" change \"DFP1\" to what is listed before \"CONNECTED\" in the output of the command (it is case sensitive).  Only problem with this on my setup is that some windows jump part way off the top of the screen when running the on/off part of the script (Alt-Drag them back down if it happens to you).  Maybe someone can code a better solution/workaround.\n#! /bin/bash\n\n# Turn off the DFP1 Output\nxrandr --output DFP1 --off\n# Turn DFP1 back on\nxrandr --auto \n\n# Set Screen to fit TV\naticonfig --set-dispattrib=dfp1,positionX:0\naticonfig --set-dispattrib=dfp1,positionY:0\naticonfig --set-dispattrib=dfp1,sizeX:1920\naticonfig --set-dispattrib=dfp1,sizeY:1080\n\n\nA: Same problem.

I have one partition with Ubuntu 9.10, and another with Windows Vista.\nI am trying to upgrade Ubuntu to 12.04 since 9.10 is no longer supported.  I understand I need to do a fresh install with a disc (rather than just updating from synaptic, since it's such a big jump).\nWhen I do this, will my data on the Windows partition be affected?  \nI don't have much space to back things up, so I thought I'd just move any unbacked-up data from the Ubuntu partition onto the Windows partition.  Then, I'll wipe the Ubuntu partition and install 12.04 on it.\nIs this a bad idea?\n\nA: You could in fact just do the clean install over the existing 9.10 install rather than remove partitions and then start the installer.\nWhen the partition part of the installer starts - choose Something Else\nThis will then show you a list of your partitions, you say you only have one partition for Ubuntu, this will show as a linux partition, there will also be a linux-swap - you can ignore that. Ignore the NTFS partition.\n\nSelect the linux partition - then select the Change button underneath the listing\n\nIn the new window - Use As Ext4 - mark for formatting, and use / for the mount point.\nExit that back to the partition listing, check there is a tick mark in the Mount point box against the partition and carry on with the install.\n\n\nA: There won't be any problem. \nJust be careful while wiping out using GParted. Double check you are doing it for the right partition.  \nGood Luck, :)\n\nA: As long as you don't actually touch the Windows partition in gparted, you'll be fine.

If you want to wipe your Ubuntu install completely, simply format the ext3 partition. You can use the same swap space as before.\nWhen Ubuntu is done installing, it will recognize that Windows is installed alongside it and GRUB (the boot manager) will add it to the startup menu. In this sense, Ubuntu is a lot more multi-os friendly than Windows, because in the same situation Windows would just override GRUB and boot Windows instantly, without the choice to go into the existing Linux partition :)\n\nA: Your Windows partition should not be touched by an upgrade but depending on your individual setup Grub Legacy may be replaced by Grub2 on the boot partition.

I've just installed Ubuntu 12.04 (64-bit) on a brand new Dell Latitude e6420, and I'm having a few problems. This laptop has an Optimus (?) setup - i.e. integrated gfx and an Nvidia Quadro NVS 4200M.\n\n\n*\n\n*First problem - I ran setup, etc, and discovered that I can only run unity2d - If I try and login with unity3d, it just defaults to 2d. This is with nvidia-current installed (302.07). Note also that I can't run nvidia-settings (\"You do not appear to be using the NVIDIA X driver.\"), and there is no additional drivers found (\"No proprietary drivers are in use on this system\").\n\n*I tried to troubleshoot this, and removed nvidia, leaving (I guess) just Nouveau drivers - In that case, unity3d did work, but I was stuck with the open source Nouveau drivers powering the integrated graphics.\nSo, obviously, I want to run unity3d, and be using the more powerful Nvidia graphics card.\nI've tried a bit of tinkering around, but I'm not sure the best way to proceed, or perhaps more importantly, I'm not sure of what the best final solution might be. I've heard about bumblebee - but frankly, I would prefer to have the proprietary Nvidia drivers working properly. \nAny help would be much appreciated!\n\nA: So I believe I've fixed it. I'll note down here what I did, in case someone (me included) needs to repeat this on an Optimus setup.\n\n\n*\n\n*Firstly, unfortunately, I needed to reinstall ubuntu. During install, I chose not to install updates during installation. Note that when it booted for the first time it still would not run unity-3d, only 2d.\n\n*I added the X-SWAT ppa: sudo add-apt-repository ppa:ubuntu-x-swat/x-updates, and sudo apt-get update then I used the software updater tool. I used this rather than apt-get upgrade so I could choose which updates to install. I went through the list and ensured that there was no nvidia updates selected.\n\n*I now checked installed packages, and noted that nvidia-current and nvidia settings were installed. I removed both of these.\n\n*I restarted. Now, I installed mesa-utils, and restarted, and noticed that now unity-3d IS working. (hooray!)\n\n*Now, just to be sure, I remove the configuration file generated by nvidia if any:\n rm /etc/X11/xorg.conf\n\n\n*Reinstall Xorg and mesa packages...\n   sudo apt-get --reinstall install xserver-xorg-core libgl1-mesa-glx:* libglx-mesa-dri:*\n\n*Now reconfigure x-org... I'm not sure if you need to do this. I did and it didn't kill anything (I think).\nsudo dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg\n\n*sudo reboot\n\n*Now install bumblebee as directed by @Web-E above.\nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:bumblebee/stable then sudo apt-get update\n\n*To install Bumblebee using the proprietary nvidia driver:\nsudo apt-get install bumblebee bumblebee-nvidia\n\n*Run following\nsudo usermod -a -G bumblebee $USER\n\n*And finally, sudo reboot\nNote, when prompted by update manager to install nvidia-common (September 2012), I did - and it didn't break anything. I suspect that perhaps whatever bugs were present early on have been ironed out. Still... I will not install nvidia-common to begin with, but follow this tutorial above.\nIf anyone has any comments or suggestions as to how this method should be changed, please tell me!\nDave.\n\nA: There is no way you can turnoff intel and work with nvidia only because the images are transported through intel card.

Have you looked for restricted drivers that might be available for the graphic card you're using? (You can do this from the \"restricted drivers\" option in the menus)\n\nA: I'm experiencing a similar problem.  Both the proprietary NVIDIA drivers are the problem.  Once installed they both identify my monitors as Laptop.  Once I reverted back to the open source nouveau driver, it properly identified both monitors by the hardware ID, but also allowed me to select a primary monitor for the unity launcher.  The display control panel now works properly, but when I had either of the two proprietary drivers installed, the display control panel only identified one large monitor as laptop which then limited my ability to control which screen I wanted the unity launcher.  The Nvidia setting manager properly identified the two screen, but I could not override whatever is feeding the Display control panel.  Very strange.  Simply reverting to the open source default driver corrected the propblem for me, with the only annoying caveat that the GPU fan now runs rather loudly compared to the silky smooth quiet of the proprietary driver.  For me its listening to the fan and having the desktop look and feel like I want or run the nvidia drivers and have a quiet running GPU, but a desktop that misidentifies my monitor and limits my ability to control my desktop.

If you read the fine print Oracle does only officially support Red Hat Enterprise Linux. Until Oracle starts to support Ubuntu you might be better served with it.\n\nA: While it is possible to install RPMs, packages for the originally called Red Hat Package Manager, through use of alien in Debian based Linux distributions like Ubuntu it is mostly not recommended. Use a RPM based enterprise distribution like Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL), Oracle Linux or the free CentOS. They are all mostly built from the source code of RHEL and should provide compatible if not equal package versions of the available software in equal numbered releases (RHEL 6.1 = CentOS 6.1). There are also distributions like Fedora, but they are not recommended for running enterprise software.\nI'm not very familiar with RHEL but 'EL5' indicates that this package is for RHEL5. The current version of RHEL is RHEL6. RHEL5 is still supported but phased out. Especially in enterprise environments you should use the most recent software version that contains all security patches that the vendor of the software provides and you should always get the software directly from the vendor.\n\nA: I don't really understand your question. First of all, Ubuntu is based on Debian, so what you call \"rpms\" are actually deb-files in Debian, rpm is used in Red Hat among others as far as I know. You can convert rpm-files into deb-files with a program called Alien, but that is probably unnecessary as deb-files are almost always available.\nAs to the actual packages, could you supply any information on why you are unable to install them? Could you not install them simply by running\nsudo apt-get install \n\nFor the packages that you are missing?\nIf you supply some more information on how you're experiencing the error, it might be easier to help you.\n", "Q: How do I get a Dell Wireless 1350 adapter working?

However I can connect with a ethernet connection. What should I do to get my dell wireless 1350 adapted to work with Ubuntu?\n\nA: This is a quite common problem, first of all you should check that you've installed the restricted drivers for your wireless adapter. You can find these if you just search for \"driver\" in the Unity search bar. After installing these, you might get it to work.\nIf it still does not work, you might need to try other options.

Or should I file a bug?\n(theres's already a launchpad question on this, and here's the oldish ubuntu page for configuring a marble mouse.\n\nA: I found the answer here and here. You need to run the following command:\ngsettings set org.gnome.settings-daemon.peripherals.mouse middle-button-enabled true\n\nYou only need to do this once - Gnome remebers the setting for your next logon - though you need to do it for each user. If someone knows a way around this, feel free to edit this answer (:\nIt seems Gnome sets this to 'false' by default, and does so after xorg does it's settings (so it overrides xorg settings in xorg.conf or ...-evdev.conf etc..)\nThe setting can also be changed with the dconf-editor in the dconf-tools package (thanks Walt). Go to org::gnome::settings-daemon::peripherals::mouse and tick 'middle-button-enabled'.\n\nA: I am experiencing the same problem after updating from 10.04. I have applied the settings to /usr/share/X11/xorg.conf.d/10-evdev.conf as suggested in https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Logitech_Marble_Mouse and this gives the required scrolling using the trackball, but the two-large-button middle-click merely gives a right-click effect. \nI have appended the following settings ing 10-evdev.conf:\nSection \"InputClass\"\n        Identifier  \"Marble Mouse\"\n        MatchProduct \"Logitech USB Trackball\"\n        MatchIsPointer \"on\"\n        MatchDevicePath \"/dev/input/event*\"\n        Driver \"evdev\"\n        Option \"ButtonMapping\" \"1 8 3 4 5 6 7 2 2\"\n        Option \"EmulateWheel\" \"true\"\n        Option \"EmulateWheelButton\" \"8\"\n        Option \"ZAxisMapping\" \"4 5\"\n        Option \"XAxisMapping\" \"6 7\"\n        Option \"Emulate3Buttons\" \"true\"\nEndSection\n\nThis maps the middle button click to either of the small buttons (8 & 9) and allows the holding down of button 8 (small left button) for the track-ball scrolling. While not ideal (I also prefer the two-large-button==middle-click) this might be a good enough compromise (I think it will be for me at least).\nI would also suggest that the loss of Emulate3Buttons is a bug and should be reported.

Is it safe to use btrfs in Ubuntu 12.04?\nLinux kernel version: 3.2.0-24-generic\nArchitecture: x86_64 (64-bit)\n\nA: The filesystem btrfs is no longer a technology preview in the kernel but as eager as I am to use it, I'm not switching just now. Here is why I would also advise not to do it (note that this answer might be out-dated shortly) by order of importance\n\n\n*\n\n*the file system check utility is too recent and not enough mature.\n\n*btrfs is still in active development with new features added often, that's not what I called stable.\n\n\nA: It is absolutely NOT safe to use Btrfs.\nJust performed my 5th re-install of Ubuntu 12 within a week.\nBtrfs is unstable as an alpha and crashes after each little update.\nHaving /boot as btrfs results in not finding kernel files.\nHaving / as btrfs results in major damage to the root system.\nDon't ever use the autorecovery and compression functions as they actually make things worse. Compression causes lot of file errors and autorecovery is STILL not working.\nLots of error reports on Launchpad and developers, as usually, are dismissing most of them as not relevant.\n\nA: Novell Suse SLES11 people think so, because this enterprise distribution skips write support for ext4 in favour of btrfs. \nI've tested btrfs a couple of weeks ago (with a 3.0 kernel) and I managed get 2 snapshots that could not be removed, within 20 minutes experimenting.\nI don't think you should trust your most valuable assets (photo's, music tracks, development files ...) to btrfs unless you are absolutely sure you have proper backups. If you don't need btrfs for its features, don't use it for other purposes than testing.\n\nA: If you are going to use btrfs, then you should use the newest kernel available. It would likely be advisable to run Ubuntu 12.10 in favor of Ubuntu 12.04 so that you get a newer kernel by default.\n\nA: Oracle considers Btrfs production ready.\nIn Oracle Linux 6.3 (6u3), you can use Btrfs for / (need UEK2 2.6.39 - in fact based on 3.0 kernel). And 6.3's boot & rescue ISO comes with Btrfs, it also provide the utility to convert ext{3, 4} to Btrfs by using btrfs-convert provided.\nI would recommend at least use raid1 for data (you need at least 2 block devices - partitions in this case), metadata is by default duplicated across devices (don't use -m single for a single device). I've been using Btrfs for testing purpose in several internal production environment, so far so good, I haven't encountered any serious problem (scrubbing is cool!).\nBTW: Btrfs works perfectly well with LXC!\nSee this doc:\nhttp://docs.oracle.com/cd/E37670_01/E37355/html/ol_btrfs.html\nKeep it in mind, always back up your data.

I am installing Ubuntu 12.04 using the alternate version of the server cd. On the partitioning page I have done my partitioning as follows\n/dev/sda1  - 32 MB  - bios_grub\n/dev/sda2  - 50 GB   -raid device \n/dev/sda3  - 8 GB    -raid device \n/dev/sda4  - Balance full GB - raid device \n/dev/sdb1  - 32 MB  - bios_grub \n/dev/sdb2  - 50 GB   -raid device \n/dev/sdb3  - 8 GB    -raid device \n/dev/sdb4  - Balance full GB - raid device \nAfter this I have setup raid devices\n/dev/md0 for /(/dev/sda2 + /dev/sdb2) for / ext4 \n/dev/md1 for swap( /dev/sda3 + /dev/sdb3)for swap \n/dev/md2 for /home(/dev/sda4 + /dev/sdb4)for /home ext4\nThe installation finishes it shows that it is installing grub to /dev/sda and /dev/sdb.

I wiped out the RAID and partitions and everything and did it from scratch.  I think the issue is with Ubuntu 12.04 and the way it partitions 2 TB disks\n\nA: I'm not sure if this is the correct answer but I tend to put /boot outside LVM or software RAID system. The latest grub2 boot loader might support this (in certain configuration) but this is not completely guarantee.\nPerhaps you could investigate this idea.\nFrom Wikipedia, about mdadm:\n\nSince support for MD is found in the kernel, there is an issue with\n  using it before the kernel is running. Specifically it will not be\n  present if the boot loader is either (e)LiLo or GRUB legacy. It may\n  not be present for GRUB 2. In order to circumvent this problem a /boot\n  filesystem must be used either without md support, or else with RAID1.\n  In the latter case the system will boot by treating the RAID1 device\n  as a normal filesystem, and once the system is running it can be\n  remounted as md and the second disk added to it. This will result in a\n  catch-up, but /boot filesystems ought to be small.\n\n\nA: Does your RAID volumes have metadata version 0.9?

The unstable nightly ubuntuone failed to build for maverick at that time.\nLooking at the latest situation today, the maverick PPA has now been removed - most probably because maverick is no longer supported.\nAs such - you will be unlikely to have the functionality in maverick without upgrading.\n", "Q: MySQL workbench Hangs in Opening Models I have upgraded MySQL workbench to one in repos (I purged the first version).

I have a french AZERTY keyboard. When I switch to another layout (I tested both programmer DVORAK and Greek) everything seems fine. However, in emacs, I have a more unexpected (at least for me) behavior.\nFor example, in DVORAK, I thought to obtain:\nOn my french Keyboard -> DVORAK\nX -> Q\nAlt-X -> Alt-Q\nBut I have:\nX -> Q\nAlt-X -> Alt-X\nWhen I press the Alt key, the layout change seems to be inactivated. I precise I didn't activated any shortcut containing the Alt key for the layout switching. Moreover, I'm not sure this behavior is restricted to Emacs, but I don't use shortcuts like Alt-... in another application. Is a such behavior normal ? And in this case, how can I use a shortcut like Alt-Q when I switch to DVORAK ?\n\nA: Workaround: Put Dvorak as first layout, not as second or third. At least while using Emacs. \nI have the same problem. It also happens in other applications, so I think it is an issue of the whole graphical environment. \nFor example, in the Firefox tool to find a word in the current page (to use it press Control-F and then type the word), you can check that to find the next appearance (Alt-N) you have to press the physical N key, disregarding the fact that you are currently using Dvorak layout. \nSo a more precise description of the feature/bug is the following: In the graphical environment, pressing Alt reverts to the primary layout (which is usually the physical layout, that is, when the behaviour of the keys matches the labels of the physical keyboard). \nI guess this makes sense for someone since the Alt key is almost exclusively used to interact with the desktop environment, for example Alt+TAB to switch windows, and this is sometimes done without previously placing the hands in the touch-type position. In that case it is useful to be able to locate the key by sight instead of by thought. \nI don't think it is effective overall, since for example Control-C is also used very often to copy text that has been selected with the mouse, so in this case users will still have to locate the C by thought. \nAnyway, the real problem comes in mainly when using Emacs, in which the Alt key (called Meta) is used while the hands are in the touch-type position. For example you press M-x to enter a command by name, M-b to move backwards by a word, M-e to move to the end of the sentence, etc.. \nIn my case, I have a Spanish physical keyboard and use Spanish as first layout and Dvorak Spanish as second layout. I touch-type Dvorak, but want the system to start with the behaviour of the keys matching their label since it would be otherwise annoying, especially to other users. So it seems that in Ubuntu 12.04 I have to drop this pretension to have a usable Emacs. \n", "Q: Some menu items of libreoffice only show a dash or are invisible I'm having the strangest problem, some menu items (if not most) of libreoffice are missing, they show a dash instead.

I noticed a new weird behavior that did not happen on 11.10. \nWhen I lock the screen, or when it sleeps automatically after the computer is idle, the CPU fan starts working hard (which usually means the CPU itself is working hard). When I return from the sleep to re-enter my password, the fan subsides.\nI noticed some bugs related to compiz (Compiz makes CPU run at 100% when in suspend mode in 12.04), but I tried the suggestions there, and none seem to help.\nAny ideas on how to check what's making the CPU work hard, or how to stop it from doing so?\n\nA: Sometimes background processes are specifically set to run only when the system is otherwise idle.  I have seen this setting with anti-virus and backup software on various systems.\nTo find out which process is busy, you just need to open a terminal window and run 'top'.\nThe default settings won't help much as they're designed to be watched as they run rather than read later.  If you change the settings in top to update only once a minute, then make sure you wait AT LEAST a minute after the trouble starts, and stop top from running as soon as you have logged back in, there's a decent chance the problem process will be at the top of the list!\nTo be totally sure, I would re-run this trick at least 2 or 3 times.\nIt may also help to check the system log files in '/var/log'.\n\nA: I'm on Linux Mint and have what sounds like the same thing going on, but I haven't been able to figure it out, either (thread + link to bug report).\nHowever, as a temporary fix, I've found that if I set the screen to never turn off, it doesn't happen. Of course then you'll have to manually lock and turn off your monitor if you don't want it on all the time.\n", "Q: How to save after editting 'vi common.mak' (aircrack-ng) on Ubuntu 12.04 I followed the steps from here >> http://securit.se/en/2012/03/kompilera-reaver-ubuntu-12-04/\neverything was going good till I reached this point.\nafter I found the following lines in the file\nCFLAGS   ?= -g -W -Wall -Werror -O3\n\nand edited it to make it like this >>\nCFLAGS  ?= -g -W -Wall -O3\n\nBut then I am supposed to save the file, how?. when I close the terminal I was expecting them to prompt 'save file before exit' but it does not, theres just 2 options 'cancel' and 'close terminal'\nHOW DO I SAVE?\n\nA: In short, press Esc to get out of insert mode, and then do :wq to write the file and quit.\nBut in general you don't have to use vi - when you see it in instructions on the web, use nano (edit in terminal) or gedit (GUI editor) instead.

I need my compiler-run iterations to run faster. Does bumblebeed play a role in this?\nI'm sitting on Ubuntu 12.04 on an ASUS X53S with NVIDIA GEFORCE GT 630M.\n\nA: That delay is caused by the time that is necessary for starting the secondary X server.

If I were to install extra themes, then does running them slow down performance in any way, even slightly?\nIn other words, are the default themes technically the quickest (in terms of rendering, animation, etc)?\n\nA: Themes are basically a bunch of images (and there might be an XML that needs parsing) so as long as you keep the images small you will not notice them slowing down your system even when using your own custom made themes. \n\nA: No, The default themes are not the ones that are technically quickest. You can find many themes which are more quicker than the default themes. (It does not mean, the defaults are slower, they are good for default and branding. I like them also)\n\ndoes running them slow down performance in any way, even slightly? \n\nIt depends, some themes may be faster than the defaults, some may perform slower. A rule of thumb is, the more the gorgeous, the more they use resource (hence slower).\nYou can find many themes here.\nI found this PPA to be very good for themes. It is webupd8 themes PPA. To add and use the PPA, use these commands.\nsudo apt-add-repository ppa:webupd8team/themes\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get install zukitwo-theme\n\nAlso you can install other themes then zukitwo. You must install ubuntu-tweak or myunity software to change themes.\nsudo apt-get install myunity\nsudo apt-get install ubuntu-tweak\n\n\nA: For the Unity 3D desktop you can disable blur with CCSM or probably MyUnity, that may slightly improve speed.\nFor window theming there exist a number of rendering gtk-engines with different capabilities. Some are fast and still look nice and modern like the default in Ubuntu called Murrine, others look ugly and offer no significant performance benefit like Redmond. There exist no fallback rendering engine like in Windows where you can disable the theming service.\nThe rule of thumb mentioned above 'more gorgeous, more resources wasted' is one widespread superstition that does not generally apply. Drawing a few shapes and gradients more or less will not impact the overall performance of your system. Choosing an uglier theme will not give you a performance boost you can utilize.

I want to know if I will keep and still be able to use my Windows 7 installation after I use the Wubi Windows Installer (from here) to install Ubuntu?\nThanks in advance,\nBas.\n\nA: Yes, WUBI installs Ubuntu inside the Windows filesystem and just changes the Windows bootloader.\nMost people consider a WUBI install to be slower than a proper install (where the Windows partition is removed or resized) because it has to rely on the Windows filesystem to work. If you get on well with a WUBI install, you might want to consider a proper dual-boot install.\n\nA: Your windows 7 installation will remain untouched.\nWhen you boot your computer you'll be able to choose which operating system you want to boot into (as shown in the last screenshot in the link you sent).\n\nA: Yes, you will keep your windows installation. Wubi installs Ubuntu inside the windows filesystem. The only thing it does is changing your boot sector. You will have to choose which system to boot each time you start your PC.\n", "Q: Num Pad on Apple Keyboard in Java Application fires two events I use netbeans IDE 7.1.2 for Development on Ubuntu 12.04.

In the past I would have simply set up a dual boot machine and then restart and boot into windows XP as needed.  \nHowever since the machine has multiple cores and significant memory, I think I can use Virtual Box, Xen, or VMWare hypervisors. I am thinking of making Ubuntu the \"host\" VM and having XP as a guest VM. This would be especially nice for testing/debug/development since it is possible to run applications in both OS's simultaneously. I've never setup a virtual machine before and think that by asking the questions below I can avoid some trial-and-error.\nBasically, I need to decide if a dual boot or VM setup is more appropriate for what I want to do.\nHere's my questions:\n\n\n*\n\n*I do not always need to have XP running. Do the hypervisors allow me to shut the guest VM down so that the host VM can then immediately use all memory and processor resources? When I then bring up the guest VM, is it easy to provision how much memory and other resources are used by it? Ideally, I'd like to pre-configure this in advance and then toggle the guest VM off/on without thinking about it.\n\n*Is it possible or advisable to have the host OS be 64bit and the guest OS be 32bit? Alternatively, if both VM's are 32 bit and I have 8G of RAM, can the hypervisor provision each VM with 4G of RAM when they are running simultaneously?\n\n*Which hypervisors are best for set-ups such as I described?\n\nA: With Virtualbox you can even add a link to your XP virtual machine on your desktop or between your application to start it in no time, and you can easily switch between guest and host too.\nBy shutting down your guest, host regain immediately its resources since virtual machines are to your system like application. Even when you are running a virtual machine, if it didn't use all the ram designed for it, it will be dynamically given to the host. Example: if you got a total of 8GB of ram memory, then you set an amount of 4GB ram on your guest, but it use only 2GB in his processes the host will be able to access to 6GB of ram.\nActually it is very easy to set memory and other resources on your VM, and they will be remembered on every VM startup.\nThere is no problem on running 32bit guest on 64bit host, I'm doing it every day.\nYou can even run 32bit guest on 32bit host that's absolutely no problem.\n\nAlternatively, if both VM's are 32 bit and I have 8G of RAM, can the\n  hypervisor provision each VM with 4G of RAM when they are running\n  simultaneously?\n\nI did't really understand that question, but if you've got a total of 8GB of ram, you can only dedicate half of it (4GB) to your VMs, if you want to run multiple VMs at the same time you had to split 4GB in how many VM you want to run.\nSince you are a first timer I can suggest you to use VM Virtualbox, which is good for advanced users too so you can grow using it. It is available in the official repository by terminal:\n\nsudo apt-get install virtualbox\n\nor just check for it in the Ubuntu Software Center.\nIt comes to you with a very user friendly interface and easy step by step wizards to do things.\nI'll be glad to support in your VM setup if you need it.\n\nA: Answers:\nA1: Yes, VirtualBox will allow to to emulate ANY kind of computer you want(as long as it meets your hardware specifications), You can even emulate a 64Bit machine in a 32Bit computer. So whenever you start a VM it will take up the set amount memory and VD space you told it to when starting. Even if the VM doesn't use all of it's given Memory there is still null memory sitting there that the host machine cannot use though. So if you have strong enough processing power you can even emulate OTHER processors cards etc, though that doesn't make much sense most the time and you can't monitor it as easily. And of coarse because of how efficient virtualbox is,(besides the memory thing) it does check the first time you boot(and any time after you specify), for which drivers and things that it needs to have when it boots, and tries to have them \"pre-loaded\" whenever you boot, so you do come out with a faster boot too. \nA2: Yes and very easily, though if you had two VM's each taking half you Memory, you will still have to have around 50-100 MB of ram for virtualbox and the host to use as they run in the background. So about 3.75 GB for each...\nA3: When you say hypervisors do you mean Host OS or VMWare vs VirtualBox, because the straight forward answer is VMWare is outdated, and VirtualBox is stable. So you have to decide for crashing and buggy but fast VMWare or Efficient and stable, but still takes up a bit of memory when running VirtualBox...I prefer VirtualBox, but many others with not-so-capable hardware like to use VMWare...You decide, although I do suggest using Ubuntu with openbox if you want as minimal processes running whenever you do dual-VM's... \n\nA: Unless you need to do graphics intensive tasks on the guest, the VM will work fine.  I have found Virtual Box to be very easy to setup for what you are trying to do.  You can load and unload the guest as needed.  You can easily configure memory usage and can adjust how much memory the guest is allotted.  It is best if you use a 64-bit host with more than about 3GB of memory on the host. If you are using XP as a guest it will most likely be a 32-bit guest which works great.\nAll three VM managers are great.  Xen is primarily configured via the command-line.  It is really powerful, but can be a little daunting.  VMware is not open source if that matters to you.  Virtual Box works great and is simple to configure.  Certain features require a proprietary add-on pack, but they are not usually mandatory.\nThe only thing I would caution you about is the initial disk drive size.  This is really difficult to change the virtual partition size after the initial config. I would recommend making it a little larger than you think you need.\nIn short, virtual machines can be great.  It is definitely more convenient than dual boot.\nGood Luck! \n\nA: From my experience it is a good idea to run a less often used OS in a virtual machine. This avoids reboots and enables easy data exchange between both worlds. As a rule of thumb we should have the OS we work most with as the host OS to run the guest OS we don't use that often.\nFrom my side I can only speak for Virtual Box, as I have very little experience with other solutions. However, Virtual Box is stable, free and available across platforms. I do recommend it.\nDrawbacks and advantages of a virtual machine are summarized in this answer, so I will not repeat them here.\nJust one thing in addition: if you develop software you may find it quite nice to have the bug going wild in a virtual machine only.\nTo answer your quesitons:\n\n\n*\n\n*Yes, you can just shut down the guest OS to have all ressources back to the host. You can even save a machines state to continue your work after waking it up again.\n\n*The architecture does not really matter. I run both 64-bit machines, and 32-bit machines on my 64-bit host. They feel the same. If your processor offers virtualization (it very likely does) you can even run 64-bit guests on a 32-bit host.\n\n*That depends on very specific needs where one or the other solution may be better at the moment be - we can't really give a recommendation for all aspects. Such things will also likely change over time.\nTry it out, it is not that complicated, and support for Virtual Box is excellent.\nHere is an example of memory usage from Virtual Box machines:\n\nLeft side is\n\n\n*\n\n*Ubuntu 11.10 64-bit on a dual core AMD CPU, 2 users logged in with 2.3 GiB memory usage by various applications.\n\n*One Windows XP 32-bit 4 GiB RAM running.\n\n*A second Windows XP 32-bit 1 GiB RAM running.\n\n\nThe 1 GiB VM is sent to shut down at position 1, the 4 GiB VM sent to shut down at position 2. \nFurther increasing the memory sizes of the VMs led to extensive usage of swap that made the system almost unresponsive. Running 2 VMs with 4 GiB each was not allowed on my system here (8 GiB). One of the machines was then shut down from Virtual Box manager.\n", "Q: gdm only starts an xterm; how to get back my desktop?

I have a number of spare external hard disk drives lying about the place and I was wondering if there is any practical way of using an external hard drive or USB flash memory drive to boost performance in Ubuntu?\nThe idea sprang from using a Windows PC and plugging in a USB device which prompted a pop-up asking whether I wanted the USB to be used for ReadyBoost to speed up my system. I imagine that this may well have no relevance to a Linux system but would be interested to know if there is any practical way of using an external hard drive for potential performance gain.\n\nA: ReadyBoost improves things by caching boot files on media with fast access time. It's much like ureadahead but using an agile medium instead of just stacking the files on the boot disk. Whether or not it actually works better than something like ureadahead is highly debateable.\nA Flash drive might have a lower seek time than a mechanical disk but throughputs are often very limited (there are exceptions of course: USB3 SSDs, for example). It's possible that by removing the seek element (as it does by stacking the files) ureadahead is faster because the drive has the faster throughput.\nReadyBoost has no effect on after-boot performance, IIRC, though it's concievable they might put some memory paging on there too if it's fast. You can put your swap on an external drive but that's only viable if the disk is faster, in both access and throughput.\nIn answer to your question: plugging a slow mechanical disk into a slow USB2 bus will give you no benefit other than extra disk space. Even if ureadahead could use it (which I don't think it can) any benefit would rely on the external drive having a higher throughput than your internal disk.\nIf that's the case (your internal disk is slow) you really want to consider upgrading it. Your primary disk should be the fastest permanent storage in your system. If you're considering an external swap, have a look at the prices of RAM. Stupidly high quantities are  very cheap these days.\n\nA: I don't know of one, but I would think that any performance enhancement would be minimal. The effects of ReadyBoost is minimal anyways....\nHowever you might want to look at this: http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=395435\n", "Q: Problem with Chromium and Google Chrome Each time I got to specific sites on the internet which I use regularly with both Google Chrome and Chromium (I recently change from Chrome because of one question that I read here) The page loads for one second I see the site appearing and then it show me a blue screen no matter how many times I reload it. \n\nA: This usually happens in chromium and there is no relation on which websites you visit so I suggest you to make sure you are using the latest version.

But afterwards Nautilus, LibreOffice, etc. still defaulted to the old folder until I updated the user-dirs.dirs file.\nFor more detail, see this answer.\n\nA: The fstab entry to bind mount one location to another looks like this:\n/media/300gb/documents /home/USER/documents bind defaults,bind,auto, rw 0 0\n\nYou might need to adjust the mount options (defaults,bind) for ntfs a bit:\n    users,exec,nls=utf8,umask=003,gid=YOUR_GROUP_ID,uid=YOUR_USER_ID\nRemove the 'exec' if you don't intend to install executables on the ntfs partition. You can determine your group and user IDs with the id command in a terminal.\nYour link problem possibly stems from the fact, that documents is already an existing directory when you are issuing the link command.\n\nA: Instead of messing with mount points, you can create a link to /media/300gb/documents like this:\nln -s /media/300gb/documents ~/documents\n\n", "Q: Can i remove starforce?

Could this potentially be the cause of my networking issues?\nNote that when I open the list of network connexions it does include VirtualBox Host-Only adapter - so some installation has taken place, but possibly not all that's required.\n\nA: Every MAC address in the world should be unique, so don't assign the host MAC to your VM network card.\nA connection time-out does suggest a firewall problem. However, normally, you would expect that the VM has the same capabilities as your host system. What the NAT interface actually does is substitute the VM IP address (typically 10.0.2.15) with your host's IP in network packets that are sent out. For the outside world, it seems that your VM network traffic originates from your host system.\n", "Q: radeon x800 pro driver 9-3-x86 error installing {Need guidance or alternative drivers} I've recently started using ubuntu 12.04 LTS 32bit on my computer, the graphics card of which is an old Ati Radeon x800 pro.

Begin by determining which drive is throwing the errors. This usually be determined easily by a number of approaches such as: \n1) Issuing the command dmesg | grep ata3 and looking for the hard drive make and model. (as ata3 is the port throwing the error in your situation. Adjust accordingly) this will provide output similar to this:\ndmesg | grep ata3\n[    4.756081] ata3: SATA max UDMA/133 abar m2048@0xf7f26000 port 0xf7f26200 irq 135\n[    5.071981] ata3: SATA link up 3.0 Gbps (SStatus 123 SControl 300)\n[    5.077850] ata3.00: HPA detected: current 1953523055, native 1953525168\n[    5.077959] ata3.00: ATA-8: SAMSUNG HD103SJ, 1AJ10001, max UDMA/133\n[    5.077960] ata3.00: 1953523055 sectors, multi 16: LBA48 NCQ (depth 32), AA\n[    5.084057] ata3.00: configured for UDMA/133\n\nA quick glance indicates that the drive connected to ata3 is the SAMSUNG HD103SJ\n2) Issue the command below:\nfind -L /sys/bus/pci/devices/*/ata*/host*/target* -maxdepth 3 -name \"sd*\" 2>/dev/null | egrep block |egrep --colour '(ata[0-9]*)|(sd.*)'\n\nThis will provide both the ports and the device names highlighted on the same line as seen below:\n\nIt's easy to see that the device connected to ata3 has been assigned the device name sdb\n3)install lsscsi with sudo apt install lsscsi and issue the command lsscsi\n$ lsscsi\n[0:0:0:0]    cd/dvd  ATAPI    iHAS124   F      CL9M  /dev/sr0 \n[1:0:0:0]    disk    ATA      WDC WD2003FZEX-0 1A01  /dev/sda \n[2:0:0:0]    disk    ATA      SAMSUNG HD103SJ  0001  /dev/sdb \n[3:0:0:0]    disk    ATA      ST6000VN0033-2EE SC60  /dev/sdc \n\nNote that the first entry on each line above is the scsi_host, channel, target_number and LUN. It is placed in brackets and each element is colon separated. When there are multiple SCSI devices their entries are sorted in ascending order.\nSimply adding 1 to the first number in each line of output gives you the ATA port. You can find more detail on lsscsi here and here.\nSince in your case we are seeing errors thrown on both 3.00 and 3.01 you have more than one drive connected to the same ATA port. You are going toi want to carefully check connectivity to both ata3.00 and ata3.01  This could be a multi-bay drive enclosure connected to the same cable. Since both drives are throwing errors, replacing the cable to the aforementioned multi-drive bay should eliminate the problem for both drives. These devices usually have an external power source which also could be the culprit and need to be replaced, but the cable (being the weakest link) is by far the most likely root cause of the problem.\nSources:\nExperience\nhttps://linux.die.net/man/8/lsscsi\nhttp://sg.danny.cz/scsi/lsscsi.html\nhttps://serverfault.com/questions/244944/linux-ata-errors-translating-to-a-device-name/868943#868943\n\nA: Had the same issue - in my case this was due to 4-pin to SATA power adapter not being plugged snugly.\n\nA: While I essentially agree with Geppettvs D'Constanzo's answer, I would suggest that some of the first things you might also try are\n\n\n*\n\n*Checking that your SATA cable is securely attached and plugged into the sockets on the motherboard and hard drive.\n\n*Replacing your SATA cable. SATA cables are (relatively) inexpensive and you do sometimes get a \"bad\" one. Often simply replacing the cable is the easiest way to diagnose and solve a problem like this.\n(Although it is somewhat unexpected that two cables would both be bad at the same time. Still, it's an easy thing to check so in my opinion probably worth doing.)\nI just saw you pastbins containing the SMART data for your drives. Notice the unexpectedly large number of CRC errors for drives sdb and sdc. I suggest you start by checking the cables and connections for those drives.\njunior@mediacenter:/$ sudo  smartctl -a /dev/sda\n...\nModel Family:     SAMSUNG SpinPoint M7E (AFT)\nDevice Model:     SAMSUNG HM321HI\n...\n199 UDMA_CRC_Error_Count    0x0036   200   200   000   Old_age  Always -    0\n\njunior@mediacenter:/$ sudo  smartctl -a /dev/sdb\n...\nModel Family:     SAMSUNG SpinPoint F4 EG (AFT)\nDevice Model:     SAMSUNG HD204UI\n...\n199 UDMA_CRC_Error_Count    0x0036   100   100   000   Old_age  Always  -  57\n\njunior@mediacenter:/$ sudo  smartctl -a /dev/sdc\n...\nModel Family:     SAMSUNG SpinPoint F4 EG (AFT)\nDevice Model:     SAMSUNG HD204UI\n...\n199 UDMA_CRC_Error_Count    0x0036   100   100   000   Old_age  Always  - 398\n\nOK. So not a latpop then. ;-)\nOf course, if this is happening on a laptop than none of the above apply and I'm not sure what advice to offer. Maybe remove and re-install the hard drive? Perhaps it just needs to be re-seated in its socket to improve the connection?\n\nsbd and sdc are connected on the same external e-sata cable (Thermaltake Duo HDD Dock). i'll replace my e-sata cable. \nIt could be due to a faulty or low quality cable. It could also be that the cable is somehow moved, bumped, or otherwise jostled while the drive is being used. \n\nA: It looks like you have a bad quality/damaged SATA Power/Data Cable. Which may be causing Bad CRC's. They aren't harmful at all and you can live with them but you are going to lose a lot of data soon.\nThe SMART report of your hard disk drives looks sane, so I am for power supply issues based on my experience when setting 5 hard disk drives in the same case/power source. I finished using an external power source (475W) for 2 drives and the case's 600W for all the case including GPU, optical and hard disk drives.\nAnyway, I suggest you to run a full backup before you do anything else. If possible, clone your hard disk drive, after which you should check your cables and power source voltages.\n\nA: This is almost always a bad drive, I have thousands of drives that we use and although these errors never cause the drive to fail they have resulted in file system corruption.  I think it really has to do with a problem with the controller board on the drive.  \nI have tried everything to solve this problem, the fix is to replace the drive and things work on the same cables and controllers.\nGood luck\n\nA: I know this thread is old, but just ran into the same issue, came here from google.\n\n\n*\n\n*getting ata3.01: failed command: READ FPDMA QUEUED on booting the KUBUNTU 16.04 livecd.\n\n*WINDOWS 7 will behave erratically, works ok for a while, but freezes after watching youtube.\n\n\nChanging the SATA cable didnt do anything.\nReplaced the PSU and the problem went away.\n\nA: I know this thread is old but I recently encountered the same problem on a newly bought machine with 6 sata slots. I installed the cdrom and the hardrive on 2 sata slots close to each other and then proceeded to install ubuntu without errors until I reboot then on I saw the ata8: hard resetting link error. The machine halts up to this point never recovered. I tried rebooting for a few times and it did not work. And then I tried to replace the hardrive on one of the 4 available slots and it worked just fine without hassle.   \n\nA: This error is  dangerous and it can damage your HD.\nTo solve it:\n\n\n*\n\n*Replace the SATA cable. \n\n*If the error persists, plug the SATA cable on other motherboard socket (the current socket could be oxidated).\n\n*If the error persists, the problem should be on your power supply unit (PSU).\n\n\nhttp://eliasoenal.com/2012/10/31/power-supply-failures-can-be-pretty-annoying-to-find/\n\nA: I had the same problem. I had tried everything but only on the j- micron port on my asus p5k I did not have the errors.\nBut when I put the drive to an other power supply it worked and the errors were gone. Then I put the drive back to its original power supply but a new power connector and that worked too. \n\nA: I encountered the same problem. It was because of inadequate power supply to hdd. Changed the 4 pin power connector and it was up and running.\n", "Q: Upgraded to 12.04, can't login because home directory disappeared I have just upgraded from 11.10 to 12.04, and at my first login, I typed in my password, and then a quick console screen showed that some mountall event failed.\nIndeed, I had some networked filesystems with mounting point /home/here that seemed to no longer exist, creating the problem.

I used to experience the same problem. Solved it by a policy chane allowing logout even when multiple users are logged in. If you understand the implications(like lose of non-saved data, for other logged in users) of allowing such a thing, you could go ahead and do the same.\nIt can be done as follows:\n\n\n*\n\n*sudo vi /etc/polkit-1/localauthority/50-local.d/usershutdown.pkla\n\n*As content of that file, enter the following and save it:  \n[Allow Shutdown]\nIdentity=unix-user:*\nAction=org.freedesktop.consolekit.system.stop-multiple-users\nResultAny=yes\nResultInactive=yes\nResultActive=yes\n[Allow Restart]\nIdentity=unix-user:*\nAction=org.freedesktop.consolekit.system.restart-multiple-users\nResultAny=yes\nResultInactive=yes\nResultActive=yes \nNow restart your system and check if things are working as intended.  \nN.B: You could use any other editor of your choice to create that file.\n", "Q: Apple Magic Trackpad aftrer upgrade from Ubuntu 11.10 to Ubuntu 12.04 (64 Bit) - Multitouch not working!

Hello Dear Ubuntu Questions Community,\nThis is my first on this site and is very important to me! I currently run a Minecraft Server that runs on a server that I have to move aways from, and that in the next few days, because of many different reasons! Now I planned to host the server on a Linux based machine in a datacenter! The Problem I currently have is, that I am a newbie regarding Ubuntu servers! Now my greatest concern is security: how much can go wrong, is it likey? And what could happen?\nWhat I would require:\nAn Ubuntu server that ONLY (at first) hosts the Minecraft Server!\nThat is the minimum! Everything else can be done later. Also good would be a MySQL Server for the databaseses... (but expandable)\nLater on, a LAMP server would be nice, but that is, as said, no current necessity!\nNow, how unsecure could that be? What would I have to do, other then installing Java and starting the server on the server?...\nOr does anyone know a step-by-step guide?...\nPlease give me an answer regarding that topic, I would be really glad!\nThank you very much in advance!\nPS: PLEASE Don't give me a standard \"don't touch servers as a noob\" post... I got enough of those... I need facts, that I can orientate with!!\n\nA: Welcome to ask Ubuntu! Just as a comment, I think that your question is confusing. You might want to consider being a bit more specific as to what you want. I can't tell if you are asking if Ubuntu server is secure, or how it runs, or how to get a Minecraft server running, or what people recommend for such a server, or if any one knows of a guide,etc. You will get more answers to your questions if they are short and direct :)\nNow I have no experience with servers, but I found what seems to look like a tutorial as to how to setup a Minecraft Server with Ubuntu. I'm sure you have the experience to understand it: https://github.com/endofzero/Minecraft-Sheller\nI found this link in someone else question on Ask Ubuntu. Maybe you could try messaging those users about setting up a Minecraft Server, they seem very experienced: Interact with Minecraft Server\n\nI see what you mean now :) I assume trying to setup a Ubuntu server for the first time will lead to some begginer mistakes. But that's how you learn, trying! Maybe start with the basics. Here is the official Ubuntu server guide https://help.ubuntu.com/12.04/serverguide/index.html It starts with the very basics, leading up to more advanced task. I suggest you setup a test server to toy around with, that way no damage can be caused. So make some coffee, sit back and enjoy a good read of the guide:p\n", "Q: Sound not working unless starting Pulseaudio from the command line On my system, audio settings show no available sound card.

I want to install Win7 together with ubuntu. I know that if perform a install of windows, win will take the boot loader and will give me only option to select windows. \nIf i can dual boot them together, and not loose ubuntu, how to do that?\n\nA: It's probably not the best way, but the way I do it is to let Windows have it's way and install, hiding Ubuntu from me in the process. Then I switch off and reboot into Super Grub Boot Disc. This finds all the OSs, including Ubuntu, and so I choose Ubuntu to boot into, and then just re-install Grub. It works at least. You need to burn a copy of S-G-B-D, but it's very handy to keep in your toolkit anyway!!\n\nA: I had a similar problem, and that meant i had to start with windows and then ubuntu since when you install windows after ubuntu windows tends to overwrite grub.

I am using Ubuntu 12.04. When I open Update Manager it comes up with the updates. Some of the updates that are listed are either not relevant to me or I just don't want them.  \nIf I untick them, they just reappear the next time the Update Manager is used.\nIf I decide I don't want or don't need an update, how can I stop the Update Manager from including it in the list of updates the next time it is used? \n\nA: Use the terminal command sudo apt-get install {specific-package} to update only {specific-package} and the packages which it depends on. \n\nA: Disabling packages from the update manager  has a bit more info and shows you how to do it via the GUI and CLI. \nI would lock the packages you're not interested in to the version you're at. \n\nA: While you can use the techniques described in the link provided in csgeek's answer or in this article to pin or hold packages, I still would not recommend that anyone other than a very experienced user do this. The dependency relationships between packages can be complex and are not always obvious.\nI am leaving this answer, which suggests removing a package you do not use, in place as a possible alternative which might also be useful in some cases.\nBut I want to make it clear that removing a package should only be done if you are certain that no other package you do use depends on it! \nFor example, I use gmail so I have no use for thunderbird. I can (safely, I think) open a terminal window and use\nsudo apt-get remove thunderbird\nto uninstall thunderbird and avoid downloading and installing updates for it.\nBut BE CAREFUL. If you remove/uninstall a package which other packages use then you could break your Ubuntu installation. Depending on how badly you break it, you might not be able to easily recover.\nIf removing a package will result in a large number of additional packages also being removed, I do not think you should do it. In my opinion, you are likely to break something.\nI would also suggest that before you remove a package you use the --assume-no option on apt-get as, for example,\nsudo apt-get -V --assume-no remove thunderbird\n\nThis command will run apt-get but will not perform the remove. However, it will list the actions which would be taken if you did remove the package. This will give you the opportunity to reflect on how much possible damage removing a package might cause.  \n(Note: the -V option in the command above just provides more information about the specific version of the packages apt-get might change.)\n", "Q: Shortcut to terminal/bash script without 'instant close' I've created a desktop entry in ~/.local/share/applications.

This read will cause the command window to remain open until you press return.  If any messages are displayed this gives time to read them.\n\nThe read is the key.  Here is a shell script (I prefer it to bash although bash is becoming as popular).  BTW, the .sh at the end means shell script, not script.\nYou could change your launcher Exec option to:\nExec=\"/usr/local/crontona/run.sh\"\n\nAnd use the following run.sh script...\n#!/bin/sh\n./corona_run -prot tcp +maxcon 16\necho -n Press enter to end...\nread x\necho Ending Now\\!\n\nNotice I escaped the ! in the Ending Now.  That last line is not needed unless you are running the script inside a terminal and want to have it echo execution.  This way, if the terminal appears and the script is run inside the terminal, the script will not exit until you press enter so the terminal cannot close until you are ready.\n", "Q: Ati HD 6400M /Intel HD300 Ubuntu 12.04 OpenGl Problem After installing ATI Catalyst I can't run Unity 3D on Integrated Intel graphics.\nOn dedicated everyting runs ok, the only problem is it looks like it doesn't support openGL vertext buffer.\nUnity test:\n/usr/lib/nux/unity_support_test -p\n\nOpenGL vendor string:   Tungsten Graphics, Inc\nOpenGL renderer string: Mesa DRI Intel(R) Sandybridge Mobile \nOpenGL version string:  1.4 (3.0 Mesa 8.0.2)\n\nNot software rendered:    yes\nNot blacklisted:          yes\nGLX fbconfig:             yes\nGLX texture from pixmap:  yes\nGL npot or rect textures: yes\nGL vertex program:        yes\nGL fragment program:      yes\nGL vertex buffer object:  no\nGL framebuffer object:    yes\nGL version is 1.4+:       yes\n\nUnity 3D supported:       no\n\nmy xorg:\nSection \"ServerLayout\"  \n    Identifier     \"aticonfig Layout\"  \n    Screen      0  \"aticonfig-Screen[0]-0\" 0 0  \nEndSection  \n\n    Section \"Module\"\n        Load  \"glx\"\n    EndSection\n\n    Section \"Monitor\"\n        Identifier   \"aticonfig-Monitor[0]-0\"\n        Option      \"VendorName\" \"ATI Proprietary Driver\"\n        Option      \"ModelName\" \"Generic Autodetecting Monitor\"\n        Option      \"DPMS\" \"true\"\n    EndSection\n\nSection \"Device\"\n    Identifier  \"aticonfig-Device[0]-0\"\n    Driver      \"fglrx\"\n    BusID       \"PCI:1:0:0\"\nEndSection\n\nSection \"Screen\"\n    Identifier \"Default Screen\"\n    DefaultDepth     24\nEndSection\n\nSection \"Screen\"\n    Identifier \"aticonfig-Screen[0]-0\"\n    Device     \"aticonfig-Device[0]-0\"\n    Monitor    \"aticonfig-Monitor[0]-0\"\n    DefaultDepth     24\n    SubSection \"Display\"\n        Viewport   0 0\n        Depth     24\n    EndSubSection\nEndSection\n\nI can't find any solution to this problem.

I'm fairly certain the drivers are up to date. \nMy question: How can I find out what is running? or How can I fix this problem?\n\nA: You can find out what is running by making a cron job, a scheduled command that runs just before the monitor switches off. See man crontab. You can run top -d 20 > screen.log. This will dump the average of 20 seconds to a file called screen.log. Maybe other logs could be useful such as dmesg.

The LCD monitor is connected through a Belkin KVM switch.  When Ubuntu boots, everything is fine and the monitor comes up at it's max resolution 1280x1024.  When I switch away using the KVM and then come back some time later, the monitor reports that the resolution is too high and presents only a blanked screen.  xrandr shows that the video adapter is capable of 1600x1600, but the display device is not.  I think that when the screen blanks while the KVM is switched to another session and then is restored, it is trying to go to 1600x1600 and hence is not supported.

I have not been able to find any way to configure the system so it will NEVER try to use a resolution higher than 1280x1024.\nAnyone have any suggestions?\n\nA: See this thread - I had the same similar issue for my 12.04 installation except the resolution was being set too low.

I set the number of desktops to 4x1x1 as the comment above stated, but that didn't fix the problem by itself.  \nAfter I re-enabled the desktop wall, and disabled all the cube plugins, everything works as it should...sigh...if cinnamon would quit crashing I'd switch back to that...at least I could have my cube back :)\n\nA: UPDATE\nThe issue remains but I have made progress on a workaround.  The core issue is that you are booting up with 4 desktops but compiz wants you using 4 viewports.  One workaround is to set the number of desktops to 1 and let compiz take over.\nsudo apt-get install wmctrl\n\nThen run\nwmctrl -n 1\n\nwhen you first log in using your method of choice (startup applications or editing /etc/rc.local would be a few options).\nThis will get you to the \"1 desktop, 4 viewports\" mode so you can skip doing it manually, as described below\n\nOriginal Message\nI have been fighting this issue as well, and although I do not yet have an answer I do have some notes and have made some moderate progress.\nIt appears there are two competing workspace managers in play.  When first booting I will always have four workspaces (1x4) and hovering each workspace will declare a unique number (for example 'Current workspace: \"Workspace 2\"').  Clicking on workspaces 2-4 will result in the above mentioned behavior, the panels vanish and you are left with only a background image and seemingly no way to return to workspace 1.\nI have found that initiating the run window Alt+F2 will bring you back to workspace 1, so you do not need to reboot.\nIf you right click on the workspace switcher, select preferences, and change the number of workspaces to 1, compiz will take over, and visually you will go from 2 workspaces \"down\" to 4 (assuming you have compiz set to four workspaces as I do).  Now however hovering any of the workspaces will show as \"Workspace 1\".  All compiz effects and features appear to work at this point.  I have played with different workspace configurations in compiz, and so long as that \"primary\" workspace manager is set to 1 the settings come through; at two or more it overrides compiz and only workspace 1 is usable.\nI have attempted to set the number of workspaces to 1 via Conf Editor /apps/metacity/general/num_workspaces and though the value is saved, it does not have an effect during reboots.\nI do notice that I am unable to drag a program between workspaces.  Context menu switching (Move to Workspace Right for example) works, but basically the workspace switcher in the corner recognizes all four of compiz's workspaces as sitting inside \"one workspace\" so dragging things around does not work.\nSo for me, upon first log in, I right click workspace switcher, preferences, set workspaces to 1, and from there I'm good until reboot.  A bit of a pain but I'm living with it while still searching for a better solution.\nHope this info helps\n\nA: Seems like the quick answer is to try Gnome Classic (no effects). Something in effects breaks workplace switcher.\nNow, if they could only do classic window AND application menus along with the option of a classic workspace switcher AND Unity HUD, life would be better.\n\nA: The fix in post 2 works well.\nJust to clarify for those not familiar with Gnome classic startup applications:\nClick on the cogwheel shaped power switch on the top right (usually) - the one that's normally used to shut down, restart or log out, and select Startup Applications.\nClick on \"Add\" and type in wmctrl -n 1 in the \"Command box\" and this will do the trick on every start-up/login.\nAnother way is to add the line in ~/.gnome2/session-manual file.  I didn't do it this way in case they corrected the problem later on: it's easier to remove the fix in future with above, as I personally would forget where the hell the session-manual file was as time goes on...\n\nA: I struggled a bit with this myself and eventually it was much easier and quicker to reset the settings to default via preferences in compiz and just re-enable workspace via system after enabling the unity plugin, some work in configuring effects to your liking i know but it will save you all the time searching for settings.\n\nA: This is still an existing bug in 16.04, \nusing the right click shortcut does not work, but\nthe following keyboard shortcut does work:\nCtrl+Alt+Shift+<Arrow Key>\n\nA: If you are using Compiz then go to ccsm then select General Options. There's a Desktop Size tab. Select that and you can set the Horizonal Virtual Size there.\n", "Q: Shank installation problem after several attempts I was not able to install Shank.I've download the bin and .deb (for 64bit architecture) files.

If youa re n <=17.04, this PPA will give you Gimp 2.8.22.\nFor older versions (most notably 16.04):\n\n\n*\n\n*The official way: you install a \"flatpak\" version, which is an application with is own set of dependent libraries. Instructions are available on the Gimp download page.\n\n*The unofficial way: you install an \"AppImage\" (which is another way to \"containerize\" the application). There are several builders for this, one version is here.\n\n\nBoth methods have their restrictions, in particular it can be difficult to add your favorite compiled plugins (script-fu and python plugins are usually OK).\n\nA: Ubuntu 12.04 LTS, 14.04 LTS, 16.04 LTS, 17.10, 18.04 LTS\nYou can do this through the Terminal:\n\n*\n\n*Uninstall GIMP\n sudo apt-get autoremove gimp gimp-plugin-registry\n\n\n\n*Add the following PPA\n sudo add-apt-repository ppa:otto-kesselgulasch/gimp\n sudo apt-get update\n\n\n\n*Reinstall the latest GIMP\n sudo apt-get install gimp\n\nUbuntu 20.04 LTS and above\nSteps 1 and 3 are the same. In step 2, use the following PPA.\nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:ubuntuhandbook1/gimp\n\n\nA: Ubuntu versions prior to 12.04\nCurrently there is no method to install Gimp 2.8 on any version below 12.04.\nIn terms of is it possible ...\nUnlikely for the following reason:\nThe dependencies of the latest versions of Gimp require a-lot of the latest underlying libraries that you will not find by default in any version below 12.04. Thus, you will need to recompile and rewrite portions of the code to get it to compile.  The further away you get from 12.04, the larger the change required.\nA maintainer of the Gimp package (ppa:matthaeus123/mrw-gimp-svn) mentions in the description that it needs the latest Gnome-3 PPA as well as some other testing libraries.  Both of these will not install on gnome-2 environments (below 11.10).  Looking at the dependency lists for 12.04 version of Gimp, these are also not available in 11.10.\nWill it ever be available in a PPA for versions below 12.04?  Its probably safe to say unlikely unless there is an enterprising developer out there who wishes to port this to this.\nUntil then, UbuntuForums has an interesting thread on how to compile from source.\n\nThus - if you definitely want Gimp 2.8 - look to installing 12.04 + one of its many desktop environments.\n\nA: To get GIMP 2.8 on Lucid 10.04.4 have a look at this:\nhttp://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?p=11946325\n\nA: Ubuntu 16.10\napt install gimp\n\nQuite easy now.\n\nA: Here is the flatpak way of installing GIMP:\nflatpak install flathub org.gimp.GIMP\n\nOnce installed you can run GIMP by using this command:\nflatpak run org.gimp.GIMP\n\nFor me, GIMP would not run as a regular user because of permission errors.  You can find the errors by running GIMP in terminal.

In Software Center, I have to run through the purchasing process even if a product is priced with 0$ (e.g. 'Full Circle Magazine'). That makes no sense to me. If the price of the product is 'zero', It should not lead through the purchasing process and instead should just let me install the product straightaway.\nCan I know why this is the case and can someone point me to the design decisions for this if there are any?\n\nA: Usually, free software end up in software-center through Debian repository import but there are special channels to get software directly into Ubuntu repository. \nThe reason why some products end up with a price tag of $0.00 but have to be installed through a purchasing process is because they were added directly to the Ubuntu repository through the myapps.ubuntu.com portal. Because of the interface of the portal, the only way to release the product for free is if you set a $0.00 price. Hence, you see a buy button for products even when you don't actually have to pay anything for the product. \nThis issue has been notified and the design spec of software-center has been modified to sort this issue. \nA bug report has already been filed to rectify this problem and hopefully the Q-release will have this bug fixed. \n", "Q: Which package contains EC2 kernel in Ubuntu 12.04 In Lucid Lynx (10.04 LTS) I used linux-image-ec2 package which is not available any more.\nI need a package containing those files (or newer)\n\n\n*\n\n*vmlinuz-2.6.32-345-ec2\n\n*initrd.img-2.6.32-345-ec2\n\n\nUsing those images for xen based virtual hosts with pygrub.\n\nA: I found my package: linux-image-virtual - Linux kernel image for virtual machines\n\nA: How about this website?\n\n", "Q: How to make selected-folder text more legible in Marlin File Manager?

At least, it's supposed to.\nWhen I'm NOT in Unity2D (i.e. Unity 3D or simply \"Unity\" as it shows when I log in), I can put the window full screen on my Right-Side monitor, but if I push the window to the top of the left monitor and let go, it snaps to Full-Screen on the RIGHT monitor !!!!!\nIt's really frustrating, because of course the whole purpose of having two monitors is to be able to view different things at the same time.\nQuestion\nDoes anyone know what is causing this? \nI feel like maybe it's accepting the right side monitor as the \"Primary\" or something like that.  It only occurs sometimes, not constantly.  It only started doing it since the update to 12.04.  Also, Compiz process is running and taking a LOT of my processor, even if the computer is doing nothing. My CPU used to idle at around 30-31C, but now just sitting there, it's around 39-41C....12.04 is sucking big time right now in my opinion (not worth much).\nThanks for the input!\n\nA: Solution\nI figured it out. Like Pauk said, it has to do with different resolutions.\nIt only occurs when trying to move a full-size window from large monitor to small monitor.\nTo solve the problem:\nResize the window in the large monitor so it is smaller than what would be full-screen on the smaller monitor (i.e. the window will fit in the smaller monitor without touching any edges).\nNext, drag it to the top of the smaller monitor and release to make it full screen (or drag it to the smaller monitor and \"maximize\" it).\nLike Miceterminator said, you can also drag to the side.....just do something to the window is SMALLER than full-screen of the smaller monitor.\nDiscussion\nSo the problem is we are trying to fit a large window (1920x1080 for me) onto a smaller (1600x900 for me) \"canvas\" so to speak. That explains why it pops back over to the larger monitor. Simply making it small enough to fit on your \"smaller canvas,\" then maximizing it to fill completely, seems to be the solution.\nI'm glad we got THAT figured out!\n\nA: I noticed that happens when you have different resolutions on your monitors. For example, I have laptop with 1366x768 resolution and external monitor in 1920x1080.\nWhen you try to maximize (either by snapping it to top edge or via maximize button) and the window height is greater than screens vertical height (on my laptop) it will maximize on the screen with higher resolution (on external monitor). \n\nA: I would like to point out, that the window snapping is quite glitchy on my dualhead setup as well. However, when compiz choses the wrong monitor for the full screen application I try to snap it to the side of the monitor where I want it (half of the monitor with the window) and when I try to maximize it again on the monitor, it works.\nAlso be aware of the mouse barrier between the two monitors sometimes the window moves on the other monitor but the mouse stays behind. So if you try to maximize it, compiz uses the monitor on which the mouse is located, so it snaps to the wrong monitor. As the barrier is only to access the launcher on the second monitor I used compiz-config-settings-manager (ccsm) to disable the barrier (I believe you can find it under the unity plugin settings).\n", "Q: Wifi signal weak while on an HP Pavilion G6 I have just installed Ubuntu 12.04 LTS along with the standard Windows 7 on my new HP pavillion g6 (AMD).\nThey both work fine but when I am running Ubuntu, the wifi signal strength shows low (occasionally disconnecting). If I run Windows 7, the signal is always very strong and it never disconnects.\nHow can that be and is there a fix?\n\nA: Did you try this?\nsudo iwconfig wlan0 power off\n\n(Assuming wlan0 is the wireless interface you're running.)\nThis may fix the problem. This does not turn off your wireless card; rather, it disables power management for your wireless card.

Hopefully you all can point me in the right direction?\nMy situation is I've currently got a five year old MacBook Pro running OS 10.6. I've been reading lately that Apple is likely to drop support, specifically security support, for this OS once it releases 10.8 late this summer. My hardware is ineligible to upgrade any further but is otherwise running just fine. I don't want to buy a new computer so I did some searching an stumbled upon Ubuntu. \nFrom what I've seen on this site and others it seems like a pretty slick OS, especially for the price. But would and Intel Core Duo with 2GB of ram be able to handle it?\nAlso, I went out an got one of those blasted Timecapsule router/wireless hard drives. I bought it specifically because I wanted to make my transition to my next mac seamless. But if I switch to Ubuntu would I even be able to use the thing? Would there be any automatic back up programs I could use with it in Ubuntu? Is there a Ubuntu equivalent to Time machine?\nAny guidance would be most appreciated.\nThank you,\n\nA: I think it would be no Problem to run Ubuntu on that hardware. On my pentium processor with 2 x 2,13 GHz, with two web browsers and a file manager opened it only takes 800 MB of my 4 GB RAM and runs flawlessy.\nIf you update from one release to another, you can keep your programs and settings. If you buy a new device, you can keep your settings (backup your home folder) but you'd have to reinstall your programs, even if there are many scripts in the web that make this a lot simpler.\n\nA: Ubuntu would be pretty slick at any price!  I can only answer 1/2 of your question.  I have run Ubuntu on much more modest hardware.  Like anything else, the faster the hardware the better the experience, that said, you should get at least the performance you get from OSX.\nAs for the timecapsule, I am not sure that the backup will work because I am not familiar with it.\nI found this.  It looks possible with Deja Dup (Ubuntu's default backup client) but not ideal.\nSorry I cannot be more helpful.\n\nA: You could try it, and if it turns out to be slow, try adding more RAM. You MBP should support at least 4GB (maybe up to 16GB depending on the exact model).

In Unity, the menu bar for most applications appears on the top panel, on mouse-over. Additionally, one can use the keyboard to quickly access menu items by pressing alt and typing what you're looking for.\nThe mouse-over menu, however, hides some items. Is there any way to get these to be shown, all the time? (Is this bug?)\nThe only example I know of (and they're hard to discover, because you can't enumerate choices from the alt finder, and you can't easily see what's missing from the menu itself) is the entire \"Format\" menu in Thunderbird. It resides under Options → Format, or so claims the alt finder.\nNote that this question pertains to the items within the menu not the menu bar itself; specifically, this is not the same question as \"Can auto-hide for the application menu be turned off in Unity?\" which is referring to the bar as a whole and not items within it — the answer there is unrelated to this question.

I have installed ubuntu alongside windows 7 in a brand new computer and it worked fine for some days. Eventually, Windows showed some problems, but after a safety mode initialization it was working again. Then, Ubuntu cracked and I couldn't use it. After that, I have reinstalled Windows using the recovery CD and now I can't boot from the CD. I put the CD with the Ubuntu image on the drive, turn the computer on, press f12 to choose the drive for the boot, select to boot from the CD and then it automatically starts Windows, ignoring my choice. How can I substitute Windows for Ubuntu? \n\nA: Try doing off a Live USB.\n\nUsing a USB drive?\nMost newer computers can boot from USB. You should see a welcome screen prompting you to choose your language and giving you the option to install Ubuntu or try it from the CD.\nIf your computer doesn’t automatically do so, you might need to press the F12 key to bring up the boot menu, but be careful not to hold it down - that can cause an error message.\n\nFrom: http://www.ubuntu.com/download/help/install-ubuntu-desktop\n\nA: When you burn the CD you should not be treating the iso file as a file.  If you just copied the file to the CD it is not a bootable CD.  Most CD burners have an option to burn a disk image file.  The disk image is stored in an ISO file.  You have to burn the image to CD, not the iso file.  If you double click on the iso file, it might default to exactly what you need.\nOnce burned, put the CD into the CD drive.  If the CD has just the ISO file, then you did not burn the image correctly, if there is an assortment of files, then you probably did it right.\nWhen you boot, go into the bios (typically with F8, F12, DEL, or other special key).  In the BIOS you can view the boot order.  You can change the order to give priority to the CD or even the USB.  BUT, when trying to boot, if a choice does not present bootable media, the BIOS will step to the next option.\nIf you display a boot menu and pick a device that does not have a bootable system, the BIOS will then sequence through the list defined in the BIOS.\n", "Q: GRUB bootloader took over my computer I have two completely separate drives in my computer. One has Windows7 and that was already installed. I installed Ubuntu on my other drive specifically for Ubuntu, and now GRUB boot-load shows up no matter what order my boot priority is in my BIOS. This never happened before, and They both kept on their own drives. What happened? The only way for me to get into Windows anymore is for GRUB boot-loader to load up and to select the Windows7 loader listed towards the bottom of the list(on a completely separate drive. I want them separate hence the reason I have two separate drives.\nI have tried to repair the Windows Boot-Loader with the installation disc, but it does not even show up in the list. I think Ubuntu installed GRUB into the Windows Boot partition maybe?\nAlso, I have unplugged the Ubuntu drive and re-booted. The Windows 7 will not start. After bios int, computer just sits. What happened?!\n\nA: It sounds like you already had the Windows boot loader on one drive, and when you installed Ubuntu, chose to install grub to the same drive, and never put a boot loader on the second drive.  If you want to put the Windows boot loader back, you need to boot the Windows install cd, go into the recovery console and use the FIXMBR command.\n", "Q: Running Ubuntu on UEFI mode I tried installing Ubuntu 11.04 on physical machine selecting UEFI mode. It displays GRUB menu and nothing gets displayed. Any idea if Ubuntu 11.04 supports UEFI mode? if yes, how shall I make it work. When I am trying the default BIOS mode, it works fine.\n\nA: Ubuntu does support EFI-mode booting, but this support is still relatively new, and EFI implementations vary greatly from one machine to another. Without further details, it's impossible to say why you're having problems. I recommend you post the following information:\n\n\n*\n\n*What hardware are you using (computer or motherboard make and model)?\n\n*How large is your hard disk?\n\n*What firmware are you using, if you know (InsydeH20, Award, AMI, etc.)?\n\n*Are you trying to install from an optical disc or a USB flash drive?\n\n*Were you able to install, or does your description (\"it displays GRUB menu and then nothing gets displayed\") refer to booting the installer?\n\n*What precisely do you mean by \"...and then nothing gets displayed?\" That is, were you able to select an item from the GRUB menu, or was the system unresponsive at that point? If you could select an item, what happened? (Did the screen clear and then nothing happened, did the GRUB menu not disappear, etc.?)\n\n\nAnother point: Ubuntu 12.04 makes significant improvements in its EFI support vs. 11.10 and earlier. I can't recommend you try to use 11.10 or earlier in EFI mode.\nOne more point: It's relatively easy in Linux (compared to Windows) to switch between EFI-mode and BIOS-mode booting. Thus, you can install in BIOS mode and then switch to EFI-mode booting. This is most easily done if you install to a GPT disk and if you partition it with both an EFI System Partition (ESP) of 100-500 MiB and a BIOS Boot Partition of ~1 MiB.\n", "Q: ubuntu 12.04 boot screen remained like 10.04 The system is upgraded from ubuntu 10.04 to 12.04,yet the boot screen is same.\nIt takes longer to boot than before and system checks disk drives for error on every startup.\ncan I get any help on it?????\n\nA: Run: sudo tune2fs -c 30 /dev/hda1\nReplace /dev/hda1 with the filesystems that it's checking every boot.\n", "Q: Is this SoundJuicer bug in 12.04, or an OS bug (and where is there a solution)?

Reason: Cannot access CD: The specified location is not mounted\".\nWhich is odd, since I am getting there through the GUI file system.\nIs this a known bug (but is somehow not searchable using the exact error message, either as  a quoted string, or as the list of tokens)?  Is there some other search term that I should have used?  I'll admit to being a newbie Ubuntu user, but I use RedHat at work, and often have to debug system level events-- those are easy to find via the error string.  Am I wrong to expect otherwise here?  Should I have searched the SoundJuicer site?\nI sent a \"report\" (is that ubuntu-bug?

The core-dump is \"helpfully\" hidden (and I cannot seem to copy from the report in any case), but I can report that the problem originates in gvfsd-cdda.\n\nA: Did you confirm the CD you inserted have no problem? Isn't the CD corrupted? If this problem happens randomly, check whether your CD-ROM drive works properly, or try to clean the drive. If you are frequent CD/DVD drive user, pick-up part of CD-ROM drive may be wasted down. \n\nA: It is a bug of SoundJuicer that they won't solve.

For that you could do:\nsudo cobbler system dumpvars --name \"XYZ\" | grep node1\n\nThat will help you find out which system node has that hostname in use and you will need to remove it. Once you find out which one is it, then you just do:\nsudo cobbler system remove --name \"XYZ\"\n\nAnd then try to enlist again.\nHope this information helps.\n\nA: Your question may be linked to MAAS node install shutdown error when installing from CD-ROM\n", "Q: Which release should I install, given my system specs? I'm new to Ubuntu and am trying to run something better than 10.04. I have a Toshiba with the following:\n1gb ram\n1.86ghz processor\nATI mobility radeon 600x.\nI was wondering which version I should use and if I could update something in the system to make a newer version work. I have booted 11.10 successfully twice but it usually gets the background image after the log in and stops, both from installs from wubi and a live cd.\nIs there a good update for a graphics driver I should use and what would boot better, a live cd or wubi?\n\nA: You should be able to use the latest Ubuntu on this system.  1GB RAM is fine, and the CPU and graphics should at least work.\nHave you tried installing, say, 12.04 and run into any problems?  If so, tell us what they were (possibly start a new question).\nI can't explain the issue with your 11.10 install, but if it is getting to the login screen that's a good sign.  It's possible that there is a problem starting compiz, which is the window manager normally started right after login and requires certain 3D hardware (which doesn't necessarily mean your card is not good enough, but that there could be a driver problem or you need a proprietary driver).  At the login screen, after clicking on your username, you could try selecting a different type of desktop session.  I can't remember if 11.10 had Ubuntu 2D or Gnome fallback as session options installed by default.\nBut again, don't be afraid to try 12.04 as well.  In theory at least, each new release should support more hardware and fix some bugs.\n", "Q: Trackpad Buttons on 2012 Samsung Series 9 Not Working Properly, appears to double click and doesn't have right click These buttons work fine in Windows, but not in Ubuntu 12.04. The buttons are part of the trackpad itself so I figure that's what's causing the problems, but is there any way to get Ubuntu to support this type of touchpad?\nThe left click button works, but it double clicks. For instance, if I click a link with ctrl held down, it opens two new tabs. Right button doesn't work at all.\n\nA: This clickpad requires some manual Xorg configuration in order to get right and middle clicking to work properly.\nCreate a new file called /usr/share/X11/xorg.conf.d/52-synaptics-np900x3b.conf. \nInside paste the following:\n\nSection \"InputClass\"\n        Identifier      \"np900x3b clickpad\"\n        MatchIsTouchpad \"on\"\n        MatchDevicePath \"/dev/input/event*\"\n        # Enable the clickpad and set click actions\n        # Single click = left button\n        # Two-finger click = right button\n        # Three-finger click = middle button\n        Option          \"ClickPad\"      \"1\"\n        Option          \"ClickFinger1\"  \"1\"\n        Option          \"ClickFinger2\"  \"3\"\n        Option          \"ClickFinger3\"  \"2\"\nEndSection\n\nThen log out and log in.  You should now be able to right click by using two fingers, and middle click with three fingers.  I have not experienced the one-finger double-click problem that you describe.  If this configuration doesn't fix it, you could also add the option\n\nOption         \"SHMConfig\"     \"True\"\n\nThen you can try debugging with synclient -m 1 which will give you feedback on what the touchpad driver is seeing.\nMore information about this fix and other issues are available at the Series 9 Community Wiki page\n\nA: I think the series-9 13\" keyboard layout mistakes are fatal, though the series-9 15\" is such a unique and slim machine it'll probably sell like hotcakes despite the issues...\n", "Q: How can I make a write-only view of a folder? I want to have a place on the filesystem that presents a write-only \"view\" of another folder that I have read-write access to.\nI'm picturing something that's similar in behavior to an FTP drop box, where files can be copied into it but not read out of it, e.g.:\n$ ls read-write-view/ write-only-view/\nread-write-view/:\na  b  c\n\nwrite-only-view/:\n\n$ cp d write-only-view/\n$ ls read-write-view/ write-only-view/\nread-write-view/:\na  b  c  d\n\nwrite-only-view/:\n\nIt's important that this works as in the example — the contents are still visible when accessed through read-write-view/, and both \"views\" are functional for a single user.\nHow can I set something like this up? Some clever arrangement of symbolic links, perhaps? Or an unusual configuration of a bind mount?\n\nA: I asked this same question for student drop boxes on the samba mailing list a few years back (http://lists.samba.org/archive/samba/2008-September/143610.html) and the answer has worked for us. You need extended acl attributes on your filesystem (from the acl package), here's Jeremy Allison's answer...\n\nOk, the problem is that students need to be able to read\n  the containing directory in order to be able to drag and\n  drop new files there. The reason is that Samba needs to\n  be able to scan the directory on their behalf in order\n  to do case insensitive lookups.\nBut so long as you don't mind allowing the students to\n  see the names of each others files, you can set up a\n  DropBox so that students can write into it (and their\n  own files) but not edit or see others files.\nFirstly, you want to make sure that files created in\n  the DropBox directory are not owned by the student's\n  primary group, but by the group owner of the DropBox\n  direcotry. So :\nchgrp teachers DropBox\nto make it owned by the teachers group. Then set the\n  setgid bit on the DropBox directory to make sure\n  that files created within there have an owning group\n  of teachers.\nchmod g+s DropBox\nThen ensure that a file in DropBox can be renamed\n  or deleted by only the owner of the file, or by the\n  owner of the directory, or by root (same permissions\n  that /tmp has).\nchmod +t DropBox\nThen allow students to write into the directory\n  by adding an ACL\nsetfacl -m g:students:rwx DropBox\nSo long as the defaul acl is set so that \"others\"\n  have no permissions, files written by a student\n  into that directory will be owned by themselves\n  but will have an owning group of \"teachers\", and\n  students will not be able to read each others\n  files.\nIf you need to be cause the files to be owned\n  by the owner of the directory, not by the students\n  who created them you need to set up a separate\n  share as described above, but then add the\n  share level parameter :\ninherit owner = yes\nwhich will cause files created within the\n  directories in that share to be owned by\n  the containing directory, not the creating\n  owner.\n\n\nA: You can achieve some of this by setting the permissions on the folder such that the target users have write access to the folder but not read access.\nFor example, to allow anyone to write to a folder but not list its contents, you could do the following:\nchmod o=wx folder\n\nOr to only give a particular group of users this access:\nchgrp groupname folder\nchmod o=,g=wx folder\n\nNow those users will not be able to list the contents of the folder but will be able to place files in the folder:\n$ ls folder\nls: cannot open directory folder: Permission denied\n$ touch folder/filename\n\nThis doesn't do everything you want, since if users can still access files in the folder if they can guess the name.  You could minimise this risk through a cron job that regularly moved files out of the drop box folder to a location that other users have no access to.\n\nA: You can create a drop folder \"write-only-view\" with rw access and use cronjob or inode notification to move the content to the other \"read-write-view\".\n\nA: I believe you could simply use bind mount trickery, in /etc/fstab:\n/path/to/read-write-view /path/to/write-only-view none bind 0 0\n\nSo, you could probably then:\nchmod a=wx /path/to/write-only-view\nchmod a=rwx /path/to/read-write-view\n\n\nA: Use bindfs, which is designed to \"mount a directory to another location and alter permission bits.\"\nStart with a normal folder that has both read and write access:\n$ mkdir read-write-view && touch read-write-view/{a,b,c}\n$ ls read-write-view\na  b  c\n\nUse bindfs to mount the folder without read access:\n$ mkdir write-only-view\n$ sudo bindfs --perms=a-r read-write-view write-only-view\n\nVerify that only the contents of the original folder can be listed:\n$ ls read-write-view write-only-view\nread-write-view:\na  b  c\nls: cannot open directory write-only-view: Permission denied\n\nVerify that the original folder can be written to through the mount:\n$ echo 'Can you read this?' > write-only-view/d\n$ cat read-write-view/d\nCan you read this?\n\nVerify that files cannot be read through the mount:\n$ cat write-only-view/d\ncat: write-only-view/d: Permission denied\n\n\nA: First, it is easier to think of this in reverse.  You have a folder that is rw for whoever needs write access, and a readonly \"view\" of this folder for those that need read-only access.\nI have never been able to get the mount --bind -o ro option to work correctly.The most reliable way to do this is to use nfs. Add the following to /etc/exports\n/path-to-folder/folder 127.0.0.1(secure,ro,no_root_squash)\n\nthen mount the read-only \"view\" with\nmount -o ro 127.0.0.1:/path-to-folder/folder /read-only-folder\n\nYou should now have a read only view of your original folder.\nI suppose you could do the same thing with samba/cifs, but this would only really make sense for network access.\nThis solution was inspired by (stolen from) this Howto. I hope it helps.\n\nA: I don't think this is possible, since you have to read a \"write only\" disk to display the contents. \nIf I were to sell such a device, how would anyone be able to verify that it worked? Maybe this is one for kickstarter.\n\nA: This is not an answer, but really more a thought and possibly another question. To me this sounds as if it can be implemented through some sort of hook or trigger.\nSome program in the background might watch the write-only folder (not by polling, it can be notified with FAM or something like that) and then move each file out of it into the read-only folder as soon as it appears.\n", "Q: How do I get a  TP-Link TN-WN727N usb wireless stick working?

In KDE, I use the \"Layout based switcher\" alt-tab task switcher, with the \"Informative\" layout. All the layouts that display both icons and text have the icons for all but the currently selected task grayed out.\nIs there any way to have all icons displayed in color?\nAs the purpose of the task switcher is to switch to another task, it really makes no sense to have the icons for those tasks grayed out. All it does is to make it take longer to find the right icon as they look less familiar and much more similar to each other.\n\nA: The short answer is no.  KDE 4.8.1 brought about this change to the task switcher, and it has really slowed me down.  The system administrator at my work inquired about it, after I complained, and the response back from the developers was \"works for me, so it's not a problem\".\nThis is what happens when \"cosmetic\" changes are made by people who do not actually use the functionality they are breaking.

I'm a newby from Indonesia, and I have a laptop with 2 OSes (7 and Precise) installed. I have installed Ubuntu 12.04 manually by replacing Blankon 4.0's (an Ubuntu-based Indonesian distro) partition. I made /boot mountpoint and then chose it as the place for bootloading. As the result, I've been experiencing error 15 until now, and I have to boot my laptop from Paragon rescue kit every time I want to use it. Is there any way to solve the problem? Terima kasih (Thanks)\n\nA: \"I made /boot mountpoint and then chose it as the place for bootloading.\"\nThat is the problem. The \"error 15\" is coming from an old grub legacy installation, Ubuntu has used grub2 for years now. What's happening is that you incorrectly installed grub's boot sector to a partition, while grub's boot sector should always go in the MBR. Boot Ubuntu then run sudo grub-install /dev/sdX where \"X\" is replaced with the letter of the drive you want grub installed to , like \"sda\" not a partition like \"sda1\". If you can only boot a LiveCD/USB system then you'll need to follow these instructions: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Grub2#ChRoot .\n", "Q: Show me only picture thumbnails Is it possible in nautilus that it shows thumbnails only for pictures and for all others like videos, pdfs, etc thumbnails are disabled?\n\nA: In dconf-tool, navigate to org.gnome.desktop.thumbnailers then in disable key within brackets write mime type of files, it will look like this. \n\n['application/pdf', 'video/x-flv', 'video/mp4', 'video/webm',\n  'video/3gpp', 'video/x-msvideo', 'video/quicktime', 'video/x-ms-wmv',\n  'audio/mpeg', 'audio/mp4', 'video/mpeg', 'video/ogg',\n  'video/x-matroska', 'video/x-ms-wmv']\n\nthen delete .thumbnails folder in home folder. DONE\n\n\nA: Open Nautilus file manager and click on \"Edit,\" \"Preferences\" and \"Preview\" from the Nautilus window that you just opened up. This will take you into the preview preferences section of Nautilus.\nSelect \"2 MB\" from the options on the pull-down menu next to \"Only for files smaller than:.\" This will work if most of your images are taken in standard definition and saved in JPEG format. If your regular images are typically in higher resolutions and saved in a non-compressed format, you may need to up this setting a little. The main focus of this step is to make sure that you can preview all of your image files but don't need to see a preview of your much larger video files.\nClick \"Close\" on the preview preferences window, the changes will save automatically.

I have since upgraded to Windows 7 Ultimate, however, I also wish to install Ubuntu on a separate partition.  My question is whether or not this is possible, and whether or not the boot loader that comes with Ubuntu will interfere with the OS Switch that currently allows switching between Windows 7 and Express Gate Cloud?\nA quick Google search has revealed that I can install EeeXUbuntu on an SDHC, and therefore avoid installing a boot loader altogether. However, it's release date leaves a lot to be desired....  I could always install Xandros that is more Eee PC friendly, however, I'd be asking the same questions as above.  What's more, I don't think that Xandros is free.\nMy second question is whether or not Ubuntu can be installed on a SDHC, and executed in a similar fashion to EeeXUbuntu?\nAny advice/help would be appreciated.\n\nA: \nI also wish to install Ubuntu on a separate partition.\n\nYes, it's possible.\n\nwhether or not the boot loader that comes with Ubuntu will interfere with the OS Switch that currently allows switching between Windows 7 and Express Gate Cloud?\n\nAm I correct in assuming that the switch works once you are booted into Windows 7? If so, the Ubuntu bootloader (grub) should not affect it. Of course, you will most probably not be able to switch from within Ubuntu to the Express Gate Cloud (but that's when Privacy Mode comes in handy!).\n\nMy second question is whether or not Ubuntu can be installed on a SDHC, and executed in a similar fashion to EeeXUbuntu?\n\nYes, it can certainly be installed on the SDHC and executed, provided your eee-pc supports booting from SDHC. Ages ago, my eee-PC 901 certainly did (with Ubuntu!), so I don't see why yours wouldn't. Please note that running Ubuntu from SDHC will be noticeably slower once you start doing things inside Ubuntu.\nOne option you haven't mentioned is WUBI. This is a Windows installer for Ubuntu which installs Ubuntu on the Windows partition as a virtual hard disk (one large file, minimum 4GB). It then allows you to select Ubuntu at boot-up from the Windows bootloader. This way, nothing critical is changed, and WUBI will certainly be much, much faster than running from SDHC. Besides, it's safer -- what if you accidentally eject the SDHC when you're working?\n", "Q: How to extract files from a split 7zip archive? I downloaded a series of packages that all compress one thing.

I am pretty new to Ubuntu and want to install it on my Laptop to have a try. \nBut I don't know how much disk space should I reserve for WUBI[I mean when I install it via window installer, what setting should I use]. \nI have one hard disk divided into two drives. Window 7 is installed on C:/, so should I install WUBI on D:/ ? \nAnd what would Ubuntu's version be on WUBI? thank you. \nMy HD has 640GB, they are divided equally, with 201gb free space on C and 85gb on D (i could certainly free much more space here;) ). 15 gb, Then I would run wubi smoothly, right?\nBtw, would installing WUBI slow my window 7 down? and how about the time used to start my laptop? thank you.\nAnd, I use D for media storge.

If you open up Computer from the Start Menu, it will show you the sizes and how much is free, e.g. \"38 GB free of 100 GB\".\nI would recommend at least 15GB for Ubuntu, if you are going to be actively using, learning and exploring it.\nThe version installed by WUBI will be the latest - Ubuntu Precise - 12.04. \nWUBI will not slow Windows 7 down -- if you pick Windows 7 from the startup menu, it should start just as fast.\nWUBI will install and work just fine whether your Windows is 32-bit or 64-bit.\n\nA: \nBut I don't know how much disk space should I reserve for WUBI\n\nWhatever you want: the options in Wubi are in a dropdown box so you can choose whatever you want. It really depends on what you are planning to do with Ubuntu. If it is just for testing you can go for the lowest one. If you plan to start to use it for watching video and you want to save as many as you can on the Ubuntu system you might want to go for 30.\n(afaik 30 Gb is the biggest size).\n\n\nSo should I install WUBI on D:/?\n\nFeel free to use either C: or D:. Mind you: if you need to re-install Windows you are going to wipe C: and can re-attach D: without formatting D:.

I installed Ubuntu 12.04(64bit) from scratch. I realized the CPU temperature increased immediately(it's not difficult to detect temperature with this computer only by hand) . When I played flash players in youtube or elsewhere I saw in the system manager that only one core increased working frequency despite all other. And that core was like 80-90% while the others stayed at 5%. Any suggestions? Should I install 32bit version of Ubuntu?\n\nA: I've been reading about a lot of issues with CPU overheating in Ubuntu, particularly with Sandybridge processors, with the blame being placed on all sorts from flash to internet explorer(?!).  From my own research and experimenting with different distros, it seems the issue is with the linux kernel.  12.04 was supposed to solve these issues, but the 3.2 kernel in this distro still doesn't seem to play well with sandybrige; I'm using 12.04 with a quad core i7, and while my overheating issues are not as extreme as some I've read about, it does non-the-less overheat, and harnesses nowhere near the full power of my processor.  Kernel 3.4 was supposed to bring, amongst other things, improved sandybridge performance;  I've installed the Ubuntu specific 3.4 kernel, and there is some improvement, but put into the context of what my processor is capable of (and fully achieves in Win7) it's still just not good enough.  Such a shame, I love Linux, and Ubuntu, but if it can't harness new tech, what's the point?\n\nA: Flash is very poorly optimized to work on Linux, it probably will work kinda funky in whatever installation you might have.\nSo I would recommend switching to HTML5 version of Youtube: http://www.youtube.com/html5 \nAND \nAlso installing the CPU Frequency widget: https://launchpad.net/indicator-cpufreq\n", "Q: How can I enable two-finger scrolling in Ubuntu 12.04?

I use some software under a VMWare VM that needs to access the parallel port. If the lp kernel module is loaded, VMWare's Player can't access the port. I need to unload the module every time I want to use it under my virtual machine, and since I never use it under Ubuntu itself, it'd be nice if it was just not loaded by default.\nI've tried adding blacklist lp to /etc/modprobe.d/blacklist.conf and running sudo update-initramfs -k all -u, but lsmod shows that it's still loaded after I boot. How can I keep the module from being loaded? I'm using Ubuntu 11.10 with the 3.0.0-x kernels from the kernel team PPA.\n\nA: Building a custom kernel is not necessary\nThis is my procedure (legacy app, virtualized in vmware player, needing access to parallel port dongle)\nin order for the parallel port dongle to work, the Ubuntu user needs to be a member of the lp group.

The simple solution is to do rmmod lp to unload it once logged in. You can automate this by making an init script, or just putting this in your .bashrc -- use rmmod lp 2>nul so that if the module is already unloaded, it won't clutter your screen with an error.\n\nI'm using Ubuntu 11.10 with the 3.0.0-x kernels from the kernel team PPA.\n\nThe long-term solution is to simply remove the module from the kernel, which of course requires building a custom kernel.

I find it hard to see, at a glance, the relative sizes of things when the units are changing all the time - especially when I have the view sorting on some other column.  \nAlso, is it possible to have folders to list the recursive size contained inside, rather than just saying \"5 items\" or similar?\n\n\nA: What you want is impossible without modifying Nautilus sources (see update below)\nHowever, there's an awesome tool included with Ubuntu which would help you to visualize relative sizes of files and folders. The program is called Baobab a.k.a. Disk Usage Analyzer and I believe it is installed by default:\n\nUpdate: Out of curiosity, I downloaded Nautilus sources and spent a few minutes browsing around trying to see how it is formatting file sizes. Indeed, in nautilus-file.c there's a function:\nstatic char *\nnautilus_file_get_size_as_string (NautilusFile *file)\n{\n    ...        \n    if (nautilus_file_is_directory (file)) {\n        ...\n        return format_item_count_for_display (item_count, TRUE, TRUE);\n    }\n    ...\n    return g_format_size (file->details->size);\n}\n\nAnd if you check the documentation for g_format_size, it says\n\nSizes are rounded to the nearest size prefix (kB, MB, GB) and are\n  displayed rounded to the nearest tenth.\n\nSo, as you can see, Nautilus is hard-coded to display items count for directories and file sizes rounded to the nearest prefix for files.\n(as a side note - if you try Baobab, you'll see that scanning the full disk takes quite some time. This explains why it would be impractical to display cumulative directory sizes in Nautilus - this would slow down the whole thing quite a lot)\n", "Q: External speakers seem to sleep Sony Active Speaker System SRS-D4 I have these external speakers: Sony Active Speaker System SRS-D4 plugged into a Ubuntu 11.10 laptop (same issue with a previous ubuntu desktop system.)\nIt's almost as if the speakers sleep after some amount of inactivity.\nYouTube videos play fine with audio, but system alerts, such as when a torrent download completes, or email notifications, are not audible.

Do both of these images offer (U)EFI boot?\nI've tried both of them already, but both have setup an install with BIOS emulation. This is quite annoying because of the short battery life and high temperatures which are harmful to battery longevity.\n\nA: Since there are different revisions of each Mac model what needs to be done may also differ.\nJust selecting the right Image often isn’t enough.\nWith Mac laptops its usually boot/install problems are related to:\n\n*\n\n*Graphic card chip (especially with  dual graphic card MacBooks)\n\n*Proper EFI booting.\n\n*Card connecting to the built in laptop monitor(again with dual grapgic card MacBooks)\n\nThe command:\ndmidecode |grep -i macbookpro\n\nwill give you your  specific version. If you are able to boot into something that gives you a Linux shell. Try to deduce your model from the wikipedia MacBook version table.\nI'm presuming models with the same hardware are of the same revision and hence the same steps should apply.\nI've always used the ordinary Amd64 ISO for all installations described below. Not the alternate CD’s which seem to be mostly used for old,pre unibody, Apple hardware.\nAs long as you have refit installed in OSX, the ordinary Ubuntu live CD or USB disk  will present you with a \"efi linux\" boot option along with a bios boot option\"\n15\" MacBook pro version 5.1   [ two gfx cards 9400 & 9600]\nSince part of your question was that you wanted to disable the gfx card.\nenter this in your grub terminal when booting:\n(You can actually play around with this booting of a usb live cd if you feel like it)\nthe values to add in grub (just plain , not appending any pre-existing lines already present:\noutb 0x728 1\noutb 0x710 2\noutb 0x740 2\noutb 0x750 0\n\nThis will disable your card and switch the display over to the correct one.\nIf your display only turns black.

Are there advantages of one over the other?\n\nWell, if you want a ready-to-go graphical desktop (Gnome/Unity), go with the desktop version. The alternate is more for special situations outlined on the release page, or if you want to install a minimal console version or a server version.\n\nDo these images offer UEFI boot?\n\nI don't know about the LiveCD, but the installation certainly should. See this [UEFI page](\nhttps://help.ubuntu.com/community/UEFIBooting) for more info.\n\nWhy is there no 32-bit image?\n\nEFI boot on Macs requires a 64-bit kernel.

Apparently there was an issue with the booting system that made it crash with the newer versions. I was using EFI to choose which OS to boot into, and always the desktop version of Ubuntu (I think 32-bit).

As reported by Phoronix, the news from UDS appears to be that development on Unity 2D will stop, with the focus being on a single, unified implementation.\nObviously maintaining two codebases to do the same thing is not ideal. However, Unity 2D was created for a reason (\"Unity 2D's goal is to provide the Unity desktop shell on hardware platforms that cannot currently support Unity's OpenGL requirements\"). Why is it no longer felt Unity 2D is needed?\n\nA: Unity 2D was conceived as a fallback mode for computers without the graphics hardware or drivers to run Unity properly. The project uses, as you say, a separate codebase, and has sucked up substantial engineering resources to stay consistent with the main interface.\nLuckily, engineers at the Fedora project have successfully developed and integrated a technology for running rich, composited graphical environments on older hardware. Ubuntu can also adopt this solution. As such, Unity 2D as a fallback mode is now superfluous.\nEveryone can now enjoy Unity, without the costs of developing a fallback alternative.\nHere are the notes:\n\n\n*\n\n*http://summit.ubuntu.com/uds-q/meeting/20425/desktop-q-gnome-plans-review/\n", "Q: I dropped my laptop.

I never had to use this tool to actually fix bad sectors, thats why I have to point you to the man page.\nBTW: You cannot fix the NTFS filesystem from Linux, you need Windows for that. Yuo can however check the disk for bad blocks as described and it can do some relocation of bad sectors (which doesn't affect the filesystem).\n\nA: http://smartmontools.sourceforge.net/badblockhowto.html#sdisk\nSee the section on bad block reassignment.

My first thought was that \"I don't use evolution at all, so why is this stuff on my machine?\"\nI then went into Synaptic to purge all things evolution and to my dismay, removing the evolution-data-server-common has the side effect of removing all the Gnome applets, indicators, and several other useful features.\nWhats up with that?  Honestly...\n\nA: That is because many applications can depend on evolution. They have export to evolution, import, or use it as backend. Evolution is Gnome's default PIM data storage center. Unfortunately, for binary distro, that mean that evolution library must be present, or some of such applications will crash. Everything depending on everything is one of the main flaws of binary package distro, like Ubuntu, when compared to source-based, like Gentoo. In Gentoo the problem is addresed differently. \nDon't try to delete it anyways, cause if it works now, it may be will not after some updates. Are you really so confined in space? Just delete it from menu and forget. By the way, default clock widget in right corner used to depend on evolution too. \n\nA: It's a little late, I know, but evolution-data-server is distinct from Evolution the mail client. I had the same wtf moment when I went to install a Gnome app when I don't use Gnome as my DE. A quick search revealed their git repo with this:\n\nThe Evolution Data Server package provides a unified backend for programs that work with\n  contacts, tasks, and calendar information. It was originally developed for Evolution\n  (hence the name), but is now used by other packages as well. \n\nhttps://github.com/GNOME/evolution-data-server/blob/master/README\n\nA: I agree this is annoying, and looks like it's fixed for Raring.

I currently have the equivalent of K/L/X/Ubuntu and Gnome Shell and more - and neither desktop usually majorly affects the other.\nHowever, you did say that what you do requires a lot of memory, and this could be a part of the issue, as the system may be a little unstable (no matter the Desktop environment or what is installed) when it begins to run out of memory.\nAnother possibility is simply that you may be changing things and not noticing (I have known people to change panel items by accident for example) - or, your system may simply be encountering bugs.\nTo sum it all up, your problem is not from running XFCE and Unity on the same system.\n", "Q: How can I get Canon PIXMA MP780 printer to print?

I'm not sure how I can get a .crash file from this and will need additional assistance because:   \n\n\n*\n\n*I'm in the middle of finals and don't have a chance right now to look into it \n\n*the only thing I can do once the crash happens is switch workspaces and open a terminal with keyboard commands (though in the terminal alphanumeric characters are all that work - the space bar does nothing and neither does hitting enter. \n\n\nHas anyone else seen this problem? A quick search returned nothing.\n\nA: Avoiding Hard Reboots\nHard reboots are almost never necessary. If you are ever in a situation where you think you might need to do a hard reboot, you should try these alternatives first, in this order:\n\n\n*\n\n*Press Ctrl+Alt+F1. Then press Ctrl+Alt+Delete. This will usually cleanly shut down and reboot.\n\n*If that fails, you can do something that is nearly as powerful as a hard reboot, but which decreases the risk of data loss and other possible negative outcomes of hard rebooting. Hold down Alt and SysRq and, in order, press R E I S U B. (Hold down Alt and SysRq the whole time, but release each letter key before pressing the next one.) See this page for a simple explanation of what that does, and this Wikipedia article for more detailed information.\nHowever, in the situation you have encountered and described in your question, it is very probably not necessary to reboot at all. There is a technique that will probably work to terminate gedit but leave everything else intact and fully functioning. You can even report the bug, though since it is not actually a crash, it won't be with a .crash file.\nRecovering Without Rebooting\nSince switching workspaces is possible, the system has not locked up completely. When this happens, you should be able to regain complete control of your system by doing the following:\n\n\n*\n\n*Press Ctrl+Alt+F1 to switch from the GUI to a virtual console.\n\n*Log in with your username and password. You won't see anything appear on the screen as you enter your password. That's OK.\n\n*Now that you have a shell prompt (like in the Terminal GUI application), terminate all gedit processes with killall gedit. Please note that you will lose any unsaved work in any gedit windows/tabs.\n\n*Run killall gedit again to see if it worked the first time. If it says gedit: no process found that's good--it means you successfully terminated gedit. If it doesn't say that, then gedit is nonresponsive to SIGTERM (the \"nice\" way of asking a process to terminate). In this case, terminate it with SIGKILL by running killall -KILL gedit. Occasionally a process is in uninterruptible sleep, which means that it's waiting on a kernel I/O operation, and cannot even be terminated this way. To check for that, run killall -KILL gedit again.\n\n*Press Ctrl+Alt+F7 to switch back to the GUI, which should now be fully functional.\nAssuming the GUI is fully functional, the problem lies in the interaction between gedit and some GUI component--it could be X11 itself, or it could be your window manager (which might be compiz, metacity, openbox, or something else, depending on what graphical interface you use). This might be due to a bug in gedit, or in your window manager (or X11). Before reporting the bug, it would be best for you to investigate this. Sean Davis's advice is good. You should find out what window manager you use. This question can help you with that. In recent versions of Ubuntu, 3D Unity uses compiz and Unity 2D uses metacity. You can use the ps command and grep to see if a process is running, if you know its name. For example, you can use ps x | grep compiz to see if you're running compiz or ps x | grep metacity to see if you're running metacity. As Sean Davis says, if you're running Unity, try Unity 2D (i.e., click the gear icon on the login screen and select Ubuntu 2D) and see if the problem still occurs.\nInitiating the Bug Reporting Process\nOnce you've gathered this information, go ahead and report the bug. A crash is when a program terminates abnormally. This bug is not a crash, so there will be no .crash file and Apport will not be able to run automatically to gather data. But you can still use Apport to collect some relevant data for reporting the bug. There are two reasonable ways to do this.\nOne option is to run ubuntu-bug, passing a package name as an argument. This will gather data about the way that package is installed and configured on your system and attach it to your bug report. You should specify whatever package you think is most likely causing the problem. If the problem occurs in 3D Unity (session type \"Ubuntu\") but not in Unity 2D (session type \"Ubuntu 2D\") then it's probably in compiz so run ubuntu-bug compiz. (Similarly, if the problem occurs only with Unity 2D, you could run ubuntu-bug metacity.) Otherwise, go ahead and report it against gedit itself with ubuntu-bug gedit.\nRunning ubuntu-bug compiz includes a lot of information about compiz, but ubuntu-bug gedit includes less information about gedit. So if you think the bug is in gedit, and you're willing to go the extra mile, you may want to invoke Apport while gedit is actually running, to include information about the running gedit process. Since your GUI doesn't work when the bug is happening, you'd have to do this from the virtual console, between steps 2 and 3 above. Here's how:\n\n\n*\n\n*Reproduce the bug by dragging a tab from one gedit window to another.\n\n*Perform steps 1 and 2 in the above instructions.\n\n*Determine the process ID of the running gedit process by running the command pidof gedit. This will give you a number, the PID of the running gedit process.\n\n*Type script and press enter. This records all the text on the console.\n\n*Run apport-cli $PID, but replace $PID with the process ID of the running edit process as determined in step 3.\n\n*Provide any information that Apport requests on the command-line. You should get a URL. It will be long and random-looking, and thus very hard to remember. That's why you ran script to record everything.\n\n*Run exit (to quit script).\n\n*Kill gedit and switch back to the GUI by performing steps 3, 4, and 5 in the above instructions.\n\n*script created a file called typescript, located right in your home directory. Find this file and open it with gedit or another text editor. Copy the URL from it and open it in your web browser.\n\n*You will be given the opportunity to write a bug report in your web browser.\nWriting and Submitting Your Bug Report\nHowever you report the bug, you'll be writing a report in your web browser and submitting it. The report should be as detailed as possible. It should describe how to produce the bug, the package version for gedit and whatever package provides your window manager (e.g., compiz or metacity), and an explanation of what conditions are required for the bug to occur (for example, does it occur in all interfaces, or only Unity 3D, or something else).\nBefore submitting your bug report, you should make sure to read this page carefully if you have not done so already.\nAfter you submit your bug report, it is advisable to add any additional packages you think are likely to be affected. Usually, it is clear what package is affected by a bug, but in this case, it is not completely clear. Even if the problem happens with compiz and not metacity, there could still be a problem in gedit itself contributing to the bug.\nIf you reported the bug against compiz (or metacity or some other window manager), you can add the gedit package as affected. If you reported it against the gedit package because you were able to produce the bug with at least two different window managers, then you should not add any window manager package as affected (unless there is some window manager with which you have found that the bug does not occur). Instead, you can add the xorg package.\nTo add another package besides the one against which you initially reported the bug, go to the bug page on Launchpad (if you're not already there) and click Also affects distribution. Specify Ubuntu as the distribution (since you're saying it affects another package in Ubuntu). Then specify the name of the additional package you think may be affected, as the package name.\nWith more than one package listed for the bug, it's likely (though not certain) that all but one will be considered wrong and marked Invalid. That's OK. But reporting the bug against all the packages that seem likely to be affected, you're giving bug triagers and developers for those packages the opportunity to review your bug and determine if they think it's affecting their package. (But I emphasize that usually you should not do this, because usually it's possible to figure out, perhaps with community help, which package a bug is in before reporting it.)\n\nA: What environment are you using?  It might be related to the compositor if you are using Unity or Gnome Shell.  Try using Unity 2D and see if the same problem happens.\n", "Q: Regionset fails even there is a readable disc inserted I just installed Ubuntu 12.04 on a Dell Inspiron 6400 and tried to enable playing of encrypted DVD's, I made sure libdvdread4is installed and got myself regionset via apt. When I try running it however it tells me\n\nregionset version 0.1 -- reads/sets region code on DVD drives\nERROR: Could not open disc \"(null)\"!\nPlease ensure there is a readable CD or DVD in the drive.\n\nI tried this as root, as non-root, with an actual encrypted DVD and also with a \"normal\" cd with some pictures on it. They both get automatically mounted.\n\nA: You might need libdvdcss - and you can get that easily. Just follow the instructions here: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/RestrictedFormats/PlayingDVDs\nOr, add the Medibuntu repos and install it from there:\nsudo -E wget --output-document=/etc/apt/sources.list.d/medibuntu.list http://www.medibuntu.org/sources.list.d/$(lsb_release -cs).list && sudo apt-get --quiet update && sudo apt-get --yes --quiet --allow-unauthenticated install medibuntu-keyring libdvdcss && sudo apt-get --quiet update\n\nA: I know I'm a a couple years late, but I just had this exact problem. In my case that error meant regionset couldn't find the DVD drive. The solution is to tell it where to look.\nOn my computer that was:\nsudo regionset /dev/sr0\n\n\nA: For what it's worth, I don't think regionset works on some DVDs. \nInitially I installed the libdvd-pkg on this laptop, and I had perfect luck playing a PAL regionless. So I decided to order a PAL Region 2 from the UK. \nI first tried playing the new disc without installing anything, but nothing loaded. I then ran regionset and set it to region 2. I fully expected it to play. Instead I got a staggered audio and a menu that was not displaying properly. I then went into the VLC Media option and clicked on the disc and tried opening the movie by bypassing the disc menus. The thing started playing, but was extremely distorted. \nI spent most of an evening trying various ways to reformat and filter, but no luck. \nI then found that my recently deceased dad had a SATA/IDE to USB adapter and tons of DVD players sitting around. So I plugged another DVD drive into the computer. Once again, the PAL regionless played perfectly, and the PAL region 2 DVD did not. \nI then figured out that this drive was being called /dev/sr1 (as opposed to the other drive that was sr0), so I ran regionset for that drive and set it to Region 2 as well. Same problem. \nSo personally I think regionset is not properly resetting region 2 for all DVD movies. The industry has probably intentionally screwed with the CODEC to make it harder to use with regionset; that's my guess. I wish I knew another program for resetting the CSS info or CODEC or whatever it is that is messing this thing up. And geez, I would not have bought it from the UK in region 2 if this movie had been available in region 1. It's not like anyone has lost money off my buying it from another country. They don't sell dry humor movies to the American market. We're all supposed to be too stupid for that sort of humor. \nThe only other explanation I can think of why this hasn't worked is that I was sent a defective DVD. FWIW, it was \"Brothers In Law.\"  At least with this SATA to USB adapter, I can try this experiment on a few DVD drives before I give up entirely.

Can this be done?\n\nA: We don't currently have a MacOS X client for Ubuntu One, so the web site is the primary supported mechanism for that platform.\nWith that in mind, if you are willing to try out some less well polished software you might want to try out a small program I've been working on as a demonstration of the Ubuntu One APIs.\nYou can download it from:\nhttp://people.canonical.com/~jamesh/u1ftp.zip\nOnce you've downloaded it, open a terminal and run python u1ftp.zip.  This will start up a small FTP server listening for connections on localhost, port 2121.  If you connect with an FTP client using your Ubuntu One credentials, it should give you access to your cloud storage.  Assuming the FTP client has a way to upload an entire folder, this may be a bit easier than using the web site.\nYou will probably need a third party FTP client though: while Finder can browse FTP sites, it apparently doesn't support uploads via FTP.\n\nA: Today you can use ubuntu one for mac https://one.ubuntu.com/downloads/mac/\n\"Simply select which folders you want to sync to your personal cloud by adding them to the sync list.

I have install p7zip-full and p7zip-rar packages to help me in this situation, but default archive of Ubuntu file-roller can not open \"Windows 7 theme pack\" files, which uses .themepack extensions. How can I open this type of file or is there any known method to do that in Ubuntu. In Windows \"7zip\" program can open this kind of file easily. I am using Ubuntu 11.10\n\nA: After trying several hours and links, I think, I've finally got the right solution, that allow me to open a .themepack file with file-roller.\n\n\n*\n\n*First install cabextract package, by entering the command on terminal. \n\n\n*\n\n*Press super+a key on Unity, type terminal on dash and click on the terminal icon.\n\n*Type sudo apt-get install cabextract command on the terminal, provide your password and hit enter.\n\n\n*Then type again in the terminal sudo apt-get install assogiate, this will install the assogiate program on computer. (alternatively, you can install it through \"Software Center\".\n\n*Then open the assogiate program, by pressing alt+f2 and typing assogiate on the 'Run a command' box.\n\n\n*\n\n*This will open assogiate program in graphical window. On the left hand side pane, click on Search Results. then type cab on the bottom text box on the right pane.\n\n*Double Click on the desired application name.

Then click on Add button, type *.themepack on the new Add filename rule dialog window. Click close, and then Exit the program.\n\n\n\nNow you should open any *.themepack extensions file with file-roller just like any other compressed tar, zip etc files.\nIf you want this settings persists globally (system wide), you should open the program in the step 2 as gksu assogiate, all other procedure is same.\nCredit goes to MistreLion, answerer of this post.\n\nUpdate\nI recently upgraded my Ubuntu to 12.04 and in this version, you need only to install p7zip-full package. \nOpen a terminal, type the following command , provide password and hit enter. That's the all required (of course, after connecting to the internet).\nsudo apt-get install p7zip-full\n\nA: A .themepack file for Windows 7 is actually a CAB archive (like a .cab file). You can open such a file with cabextract. To get it, install the cabextract package.\nThen either run cabextract name.themepack (replacing name with the name of the theme pack filename before the .themepack extension), or configure the Archive Manager to open .cab files and open it graphically from Nautilus.\n\nA: If you change the .themepack extension to .lzx, the preinstalled Archive Manager can extract if just fine. (Thanks to 7zip for dispaying the compression type in its file list.)\nHowever, MistreLion's solution would avoid the annoyance of renaming a file each time. (I simply prefer not to install additional software on my system if I don't need to.)\nIf there's a way to make Archive Manager aware that the .themepack extension is actually .lzx, it would be a far more elegant approach.\n\nA: If you download a file with a themepack extension, to use the images all you have to do is extract the contents using cabextract. Nothing else is needed. \n", "Q: Bad Performance With Games Under Wine I'm somewhat new to Linux. I've dabbled with it before but never more than just experimentation in a VM or dual boot where I almost always reverted back to Windows soon after (more due to a lack of commitment than a dislike for the OS).\nAnyway my problem is that in the two games (Guild Wars and Team Fortress 2) I've tried so far I get fairly bad performance. Despite both games having a \"Platinum\" rating I've still been forced to run both in DirectX 8, otherwise they either crash, have texture defects or the UI is missing. By \"bad performance\" I mean sub-30 FPS where there are some players and regular large framerate drops with video settings on low.\nCurrently in my mind I believe the performance issues are just a problem with the drivers because my graphics card is a AMD 7850 which is virtually brand new and probably not properly supported yet but I'm unsure and would appreciate advice or tips to improve things.\nI have Ubuntu 12.04 installed and I am usually logged in a Gnome Classic session. I have installed AMD's proprietary drivers (Catalyst version 12.4) and have Wine 1.4 installed. I have used Winetricks to install DX9/DX10 dlls and other things.\n\nA: For those that have stumbled on this post, my issue ended up being some form of fault with Compiz.\nIf Compiz was running, performance was greatly reduced in 3D applications such as games. My solution was just to change window manager/desktop environment. I discovered this with the help of TechZilla in a seperate post here\n\nA: Yeah, as Ubuntu 12.04 is fairly new things are not quite optimized yet, but it's on its way. And wine is not known for having the greatest amount of performance, sadly. : ( But just wait, I've got a feeling that gaming is soon coming to Linux as well as on the other operating systems; Valve is even working on a Steam version for Linux and EA made some (free :D ) (shitty) games for free. So we can expect more gaming content in future versions, I suppose. But have you even installed a driver? I got integrated graphics in my Intel Pentium Dual core from 2008, and it runs decent on lowest settings with the free Nvidia drivers : /\n\nA: I can help with Team Fortress Two, however with Guild Wars, your on your own. Just because Team Fortress Two is on low video quality, does it mean that there aren't other things making you lag. Unless you have a bad problem with screen tearing (Two screens at the same time.) turn off V-sensitivity because V-sensitivity intentionally make the game lag to stop screen tearing, and disable mouse acceleration because you don't need a faster mouse.

On Ubuntu it just puts the screen in screen saver mode. \nWhat should I do to have the same behavior on Ubuntu as on Windows?\n\nA: Try the following command in shell:\nxset dpms force off\n\nIf it works then set it as a keyboard shortcut in Gnome preferences panel.\n\nA: I think You have some problem by running process gnome-power-manager. Try killing the process.\n", "Q: Kubuntu 12.04 - Touchpad and keyboard stopped working at random As in the title, I've got this problem with my Kubuntu 12.04.\nAt first I've thought that the whole system was hung, but it happened again 5 minutes ago and, while the keyboard and the touchpad stopped working, the music was still playing, so I guess that's just an \"input\" problem, because the system was still working!\nAny solution?\nIs there some data that you need to know about my setup?\nEDIT:\nAdded my lshw outout \n    description: Notebook\n    product: N53SV ()\n    vendor: ASUSTeK

I recently purchased a Bluetooth 4.0 adaptor for my laptop. Bluetooth 2.1 was recognised instantly, but Bluetooth 4.0 is not recognised. Is there a fix for this, or is Ubuntu not compatible with Bluetooth 4.0?\n\nA: Ubuntu uses the Bluez protocol stack for Bluetooth. From supported protocols we can see what is supported at present:\n\nCore specification 4.0. Not (yet) 3.0+HS. Includes GAP, L2CAP, RFCOMM and SDP  from BlueZ\n\nSo the answer is yes, we do support Bluetooth 4.0. You may want to search for specific bugs or incompatibilites with existing brand-new hardware, or have a look at the BlueZ development branches at GIT for more details on future plans, and to find out if your device or a protocol your device needs has issues.\n", "Q: Fonts look bad in Microsoft Office using Wine Office fonts in wine look very different from what they look in Windows or LibreOffice. \nAs can be seen from the attached screenshots, they look blurry in some sizes and aliased in other sizes.

It expects you to have it on in the OS, so they don't bother re-creating anti-aliasing in the Office Suite. If you disabled the anti-aliasing in Windows, it would look the same. \nIf wine's own font smoothing does not work, then I don't think it will. Here's a test to make sure its just the display that's wrong. Print something...does it look okay? \nMaybe post a complaint on WineHQ under the Microsoft Office information; they may be able to help you more (and possibly fix the problem in their next update).\nI have seen this problem too (on my own computer, I have Office installed as well). I learned to ignore it. Also try zooming in on the text to make it look a little better. Setting the view to page-width may help a lot. \n", "Q: What will Happen If I dont Upgrade 11.10 to 12.04 ? Can I still be able to use Ubuntu? I do not need an Upgrade. I can check things using live cd. Can I keep Ubuntu 11.10 forever ?\n\nA: Sure.  This chart: https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Releases shows that 11.10 will be supported until April 2013\nEventually it will not be supported and then will not get bug fixes and the like.  If you never do any installs or upgrades again you'll be ok, but with most software updating pretty frequently these days, it's not a good choice long-term.\nAlso if someone discovered a security bug it may not be fixed or fixed quickly in an old version, potentially compromising your data.\nSecurity, fixes and bug patches aside there's no reason it will stop working, \ni.e. there is no expiry date to actually using it.\n\nA: 11.10 will be supported until spring of 2013, so you should upgrade by then.  12.04 will be supported until spring of 2017.\n\nA: What do you mean by \"check things using live cd?\"  \nIn any case, Ubuntu 11.10 won't stop working, but in one year, Canonical will stop supporting it with security updates.  After that, you could conceivably update things like the kernel, but it will become difficult when things bread as a result.\nYou can simply keep using it, but if you connect to the internet, it may be irresponsible; if someone discovers an exploit, and breaks into your system, they could disrupt many users using your system until your internet provider disconnects you.\n\nA: Curious Apprentice: You are wrong in my opinion, you DO need an upgrade to stay current with new software, but as others have said, TO BE SECURE.\nThe easiest way to do this is keep your beloved 11.10 going, but to partition your hard disc (if it isn't already) and load Ubuntu 12.04 as a FRESH install on to a new clean partition. You will now have a choice of booting into 11.10 or 12.04. Now, you can transfer your personal files to the new install at your leisure, and install applications in 12.04 to bring it up to the standard you require. You will still have 11.10 to fall back on during this process. Better still, create yet another partition and keep your personal files on that, totally separate from any OS.\n", "Q: How to get Unetbootin to recognize mounted USB drive? I'm using Ubuntu 12.04, and every time I try to write an Ubuntu ISO image to a disk so I can install it, Unetbootin says /dev/sdb1 isn't mounted. But Ubuntu mounts the drive automatically when it's inserted, right? What can I do to make Unetbootin recognize the drive is mounted?\n\nA: It's possible, as beeju has suggested, that you just need to manually mount the drive. However, you are correct--usually, Ubuntu will automatically mount a drive when it is attached or powered on.\nThere are two common situations where the problem you've described occurs:\n\n\n*\n\n*Technically, drives are not mounted. Volumes (i.e., partitions) are mounted. If there is no partition on the drive, Ubuntu cannot mount it (neither automatically nor otherwise). If there is, but it's damaged or (this is much less likely) of a type Ubuntu doesn't recognize, it will also not be mounted.\n\n*Unetbootin requires that the partition to which you write the contents of an .iso image be formatted FAT16 or FAT32. (And you should use FAT32 unless your image is tiny and you know you need to use FAT16.) Furthermore, it should be the first partition on the disk, and unless you really know what you're doing and know you need to do something differently, it should be the only partition on the disk and it should take up all the available space. Furthermore (though you don't usually have to do anything to make this the case), it should be a primary (not a logical) partition and the disk's partition table should be of type MSDOS.\nIf you have valuable data on your disk, then you shouldn't be writing an .iso image to it anyway, because that would destroy the data. Otherwise, you can safely address either or both of the above problems by creating a new partition table on the disk, and then creating a single partition, taking up all the available space, of type FAT32.\nOne easy way to do this is with the GParted Partition Editor, which is provided by the gparted package. You can install that package in the Software Center. Then run GParted. Select the drive in the drop-down menu at the upper-right corner of the GParted window. Make sure you've selected the correct drive--it would be bad to perform these data-destroying operations on the wrong disk!\nDo Edit > Create Partition Table and accept the defaults. Then create a FAT32 partition, also with everything the default. This will make it a primary partition and as big as possible.\nThen apply your changes by clicking the green check-mark. You can now mount the drive (or take it out and put it back in, and it should mount automatically). When GParted finishes, close out of it. Then you can write an .iso image to it with Unetbootin.\n\nAlternatively, you might consider using a different method to write the .iso image to the drive, which would let you skip over formatting and mounting the drive.\nYou can use Startup Disk Creator for this purpose, as described in the official installation instructions.\nYou can also use dd from the command-line. See dd(1). If you have an .iso image called ubuntu-12.04-desktop-i386.iso and located in your Downloads folder, and if you would write its contents to /dev/sdb1 in Unetbootin, then the corresponding dd command is:\ncd ~/Downloads\nsudo dd if=ubuntu-12.04-desktop-i386.iso of=/dev/sdb\n\nIt's very important that you tell it to output to /dev/sdb (or whatever drive you want it on), not /dev/sdb1 (i.e., not the first partition on the drive).\n\nA: I didn't get UNetbootin to list my USB drive, but you can force it to use a specific one if you know the device name:\nunetbootin installtype=USB targetdrive=/dev/sdb1\n\nYou'll find out about your device number by listing all:\nsudo fdisk -l\n\nHope this helps?\n\nA: I welcome you here!I think it is a common behavior by Ubuntu because the same I experienced on many occasions.What I do at these time that just click on the drive and open it in Nautilus window.Then come back to the particular application which need this drive.It is clearly described here.Moreover,it is better to see this drive is displayed in File system>Media.\n\nA: I found that for me it happens when usb drive is labeled with non ASCII symbols. So try to change it to contain plain ASCII. Not sure about spaces, but it's always better to name it without spaces like drive_8gb. \nIt's possible to change label using gparted for example when drive is unmounted. Once I labeled it as described and reconnected it, unetbootin started to work well with the drive.\n\nA: On Linux Mint 19 (based on Ubuntu 18) other advises already here did not help by themselves - renaming partition to ASCII characters only, formatting to FAT32, adding target in command line. \nHelped changing drive in Unetbooting graphic interface from partition to drive, that is getting rid of '1' at the end in my case.\nBTW, I did not see how I can add several ISO files to drive, and that is why I was trying to use it as advised here: Multi-partition multi OS bootable USB...\nEDIT: the issue went away after re-creating partition table for USB stick in question, now Unetbooting works with partitions too (could not boot from resultant stick though...).\n", "Q: Is it legal to install msttcorefonts package? Is Wine legal? I'd like to know whether it is legal to install the msttcorefonts package and also whether installing Windows software using Wine is also legal? I currently live in Brazil and I don't know what specific rules apply over here.\n\nA: I am not a lawyer, but generally speaking packages that are included in the official Ubuntu repositories are not encumbered by any copyright or patent restrictions that would make it a tort or crime to install. A number of useful packages are excluded from the official software sources because it would be unlawful for some users in some places to install them, due to such concerns. One example of such a package is libdvdcss2, which is provided in the unofficial Medibuntu repository. By enabling unofficial repositories and installing packages where you've been warned of possible copyright or patent issues, a user takes full responsibility for determining the legal status of their actions.\nHowever, while msttcorefonts is provided in official Ubuntu software sources, is not free open source software. This package installs proprietary fonts copyrighted by Microsoft. When you install it, you are asked agree to Microsoft's terms of use for these fonts. You would probably incur civil liability if you installed this package and then engaged in acts covered by the copyright laws in your jurisdiction and prohibited by the terms of use.\n\nA: msttcorefonts is considered globally legal for installation because the license for the fonts allow them to be installed and by omission, installed on non-Windows operating systems, without a Windows license.\nIn short: It's not a case of copyright law because Microsoft allows the redistribution of the font installers and it allows users to install the fonts (regardless of OS).\nIt does not allow for redistribution of the TTF font files on their own, so, for example, it would not allow for a distribution like Ubuntu to include them by default.\nSidebar: The newer (Vista-era) fonts like Consolas, Segoe, Cambria, Candara have explicit \"only for Windows\" junk in their licenses, but these fonts aren't included in msttcorefonts so that doesn't matter.\n\nWine is less black and white.\n\n\n*\n\n*From a copyright stance, great effort seems to go into making sure that all of the Wine code is completely original (eg people who have seen Windows code are not allowed to contribute) and that helps to keep the copyright side of things fairly clean.\n\n*But technology wise, it's aim is essentially to redevelop the core of Windows. I'd be surprised if there weren't more than a couple of Microsoft patents it trod on. Microsoft has been filing patents for every other line of code for 20 years and the USPTO has been more than willing to grant them all sorts of silly, super-obvious patents.\nAnyway, this shouldn't affect you directly (yet) because there hasn't been any legal action (AFAIK) and even if there were, it would be likely to happen in the US. I'm not a lawyer so I can't say how this would affect you either.\nIf you need a bullet-proof legal way to run a Windows application from within Ubuntu, virtualisation is probably the key. A real licensed copy of Windows running will do almost anything you want it to (with a performance hit).\n", "Q: firefox shows only blank screen when opening new pdf I use ubuntu 12.04 with firefox and adobe pdf plugin.\nSince ubuntu 11.04 upto 12.04 i have the problem that i can open only one pdf file in the browser.

I am trying to convert mythtv recorded mpg (mpeg2) files into streamable mp4 files.  Converting to an mp4 is simple, however, the entire file must be converted first before it is usable.  Even using conversion tools that put the \"mov atom\" at the start of the file for quick streaming require that the entire mp4 be encoded before that happens.\nI read on avconv docs that \"The mov/mp4/ismv muxer supports fragmentation.\" which can put a \"fake\" mov atom at the start of the file and then puts a new one at each keyframe throughout the file so the video can be streamed while it is being transcoded or if the conversion is interrupted.\nI believe I have followed the avconv instructions (http://libav.org/avconv.html#MOV_002fMP4_002fISMV)  on how to convert a file, but continue to get errors that indicate the encoder does not understand the parameters.  Below is my command, and the error output it generates.  I have exhausted google and myself searching for answers and have come up blank so any help would be greatly appreciated.\nSystem running ubuntu 12.04x64 with avconv version 0.8.1-4:0.8.1-0ubuntu1.\nCommand:\navconv -i 1081_20111227200000.mpg -f mp4 -movflags frag_keyframe+empty_moov -c:v libx264 -c:a copy output.mp4\n\nError:\n[mp4 muxer @ 0x36772e0] [Eval @ 0x7fffeddb69b0] Undefined constant or missing '(' in 'frag_keyframe'\n[mp4 muxer @ 0x36772e0] Unable to parse option value \"frag_keyframe+empty_moov\"\n[mp4 muxer @ 0x36772e0] Error setting option movflags to value frag_keyframe+empty_moov.\nOutput #0, mp4, to 'output.mp4':\n    Stream #0.0: Video: libx264, yuv420p, 1920x1080 [PAR 1:1 DAR 16:9], q=-1--1, 90k tbn, 29.97 tbc\n    Stream #0.1(eng): Audio: ac3, 48000 Hz, 5.1, 384 kb/s\nStream mapping:\n  Stream #0:0 -> #0:0 (mpeg2video -> libx264)\n  Stream #0:1 -> #0:1 (copy)\nCould not write header for output file #0 (incorrect codec parameters ?)\n\nI have tried different muxers (-f parameters like h264 etc) and had other errors like the movflag wasn't even supported (logical).  \nAm I missing a package, dependency, or just the point? \nThanks in advance.\n\nA: There is a bug filed with libav about this exact issue. Depressingly, is doesn't seem to be addressed. I think it's best to consider avconv a good encoding tool, but not a good encapsulating tool.\nThe best way to go about it is to use MP4Box from GPAC. It's a utility which seems to be primarily concerned with encapsulating media streams into mp4 files. It does not do en/de/transcoding, for instance. If you install GPAC on Ubuntu, you can say:\nMP4Box -add non-streamable.mp4 new-shiny-streamable.mp4\n\nMP4Box by default makes the mp4 files streamable:\n\nAs of version 0.2.4, MP4Box always stores the file with 0.5 second interleaving and meta-data at the begining, making it suitable for HTTP streaming. (source)\n\n\nA: See here: it's an ffmpeg guide, but it applies equally well to avconv.\nI don't know about creating files for streaming, but the error could be because you are missing out on a preset, and also possibly a quality setting (though I believe that avconv uses -crf 23 as the default, if no other quality setting is provided). Try:\navconv -i 1081_20111227200000.mpg -f mp4 -movflags frag_keyframe+empty_moov -c:v libx264 -preset medium -c:a copy output.mp4\n\nThe presets are: ultrafast, superfast, veryfast, faster, fast, medium, slow, slower and veryslow. The faster presets will give you faster encodes, but larger files, while the slower ones have smaller files, but take longer to make. There is no quality difference between the different presets. There is also a 'placebo' preset, but that's a joke by the x264 developers, and should be ignored.\nIf that doesn't work, you could try using:\navconv -i 1081_20111227200000.mpg -f mp4 -movflags frag_keyframe+empty_moov -c:v libx264 -crf 20 -preset medium -c:a copy output.mp4\n\n20 is completely arbitrary, choose whatever crf setting works best for you.

I run Cleanup in Ubuntu Tweak and clean everything up except for the previous kernel.  Reboot and for the third time installing 12.04, Unity will not load.  Log out and try Gnome.

Thank you, chazdg, for pointing me in the right direction.  \n\nA: I was told to do this, although I am answering my own question.  Ubuntu Tweak seems to mess with the fglrx driver.

I can restore some files but never succeeded to restore full backup. I tried to perform those actions with test backup of some small directory... the problem is consistent.\n\nA: It seems that you hit a known bug: deja-dup bug 826389, bug 487720.\nQuoting from the second link it seems that your data corruption is not given by hardware, but is completely software-related:\n\nThis can happen when a volume file was not completely written to the backend before duplicity was interrupted (say, shutting down the machine or whatever). When duplicity resumes the backup next run, it will start with the next volume. The half-complete volume file will sit on the backend and cause this error later when restoring.\nYou can manually recover from this by either restoring from your older backup sets or by restoring individual files that don't happen to be in the corrupted volume.\n\nTwo other guys from the first link says:\n\nThere are two ways around this. You can try to restore from the backup from before the corrupted one. So try restoring from older backups.\nYou can also try to avoid the specific volume by restoring all the files from the backup set except the ones in the corrupted volume.\n\nand:\n\nThank you very much. What I did was [duplicity --file-to-restore ....] and I restored the important files.\n\nI've never used deja-dup or duplicity, but it seems that the most reasonable solution here is to automatically restore intact volumes with deja-dup, and then proceed with intact files inside a volume restoring them one by one with duplicity --file-to-restore ...\nHope this helps.\n\nA: Try transfering the data to a folder in your home directory e.g /Home/username/backup\nand then change the backup directory from Deja-dup Settings and try restoring...\nTO CHANGE SETTINGS-\nSystem Settings>>  Backup >> Storage >>  Select \"local folder\" >> select the path as for my e.g \"/home/username/backup\"\nThe media being external might be causing problems...\n\nA: I had the same problem, and I can recover a subset of the data, directly using duplicity, the way of doing that is the following.\nCheck on your manifest files on the backup folder the paths to the files on the backup, and you can restore folder by folder, in order to avoid the file/folder that raises the error.\nThe command is the following:\nduplicity -t 1D --file-to-restore <folder or file without / at the begining> file://<path to the backup with / at the begining> </path/to/restore> --no-encryption -v8\n\nAnd you can put `--ignore-errors``at the end of the command in order to try recovery all ignoring errors but it is not recommended.\n", "Q: slow wired connection (dns issue?)

I like Ubuntu very much and it is just what I'm looking for in an operating system, but, I can't seem to acquire any of my Windows docs, itunes, and other such things I have collected through the years which I want to switch over and use in Ubuntu. I was wondering how a partition file works and how to set one up; would I be able to directly use the doc and mp3 files and movies and such in Ubuntu with this partition file? \nBasically I want to switch everything I have that is collected in my Windows to my new Ubuntu and need help establishing that. \n-Thanks guys \n\nA: Windows and Ubuntu uses diffent filesystems. Windows uses NTFS and Ubuntu uses propably EXT4. Fromout Ubuntu you can reach you files on the windows partition in Nautilus.\nOn this image  on the left panel of Nautilus you see 2 other filesystems. The one with labels 84 GB Filesystem and the one with 179 GB filesystem. Those filesystems represents other partitions. The one on your system will represent the Windows filesystem.\n\nA: Because WUBI installs into a container file on the existing NTFS filesystem it is completely different than just trying to access another partition in a traditional dual boot situation.  If you a sure you like Ubuntu, and are ready to use it on a regular basis I would suggest removing the WUBI install (after saving anything you have created inside Ubuntu to a flash drive) then creating a true dual boot from a normal install ISO on CD or flash drive.  There is a reference to this in How to convert Wubi install into regular install? (Note however my answer does not suggest migrating the install, I suggest removing it and reinstalling non-WUBI).  The normal install will preserve the windows boot, and when you are in Ubuntu you will have full access to the NTFS partition.  If I remember correctly it even asks if you want to migrate data though I have never done so.    \nI have a few computers running in this fashion because the all came with Windows, so I just shrink the Windows partition and leave it there, though I haven't booted into it in quite some time.  WUBI is a great way to test a computer, but isn't a long term solution and I have had several problems when trying to do distribution upgrades. So if you like it, jump in to a regular dual boot.\n\nA: There is a free driver for a ext2/etx3 partition for Windows wich would enable easy file exchange between Windows and Linux.\nhttp://www.fs-driver.org/\n", "Q: Lenses don't show up in the Dash I have Ubuntu 11.10 (Oct, 2011).\nI never use Unity-2d.\nI downloaded various Lenses from the Software Center. \nThen I restarted the system. \nBut I don't see any differences!

Some have \"tabs\" bellow the Dash. Just click on them and them you can make your search.\n\nA: Lenses need to be stored in /usr/share/unity/lenses.

I tried password, login name, etc. Nothing works. It then goes back to version 10.10. I've already down loaded the 12.04 several times thinking that it might be the problem. But still the same 10.10. What do I do?\n\nA: I assume you are using the hard drive of your old computer in your new computer. So you're trying to boot from 12.04 live CD and and you're old 10.10 boots up? Obviously the computer did not boot from CD, it probably did not recognise the CD. Try creating a bootable USB stick with the boot media creator or unetbootin, there may probably be issues with your optical drive or the medium used for burning.\nYou're seeing that virtual terminal because the new system needs another graphics driver than the currently installed one. Is there a specific reason why you're using the old drive? It would be much simpler using the new drive, installing 12.04 on that and copying the files from your old home directory to the new one.\n", "Q: Brightness control Issue Samsung RV520 in Ubuntu 12.04 I am unable to change and reduce the Screen brightness of my laptop Samsung RV520, it has only one graphics card Nvidia's GT520M, although brightness control appears by pressing \n\nFN+UP/DOWN\n\nHowever nothing happens, \nI tried both options usually mentioned online  i.e.\n\n\n*\n\n*Changing Grub and adding apci=vendor option but the control bar of brightness disappeared but still I was unable to control the brightness.\n\n*I also installed Samsung's backlight tool but still no avail\nWhat should I do kindly guide!

The grub steps (5, 6 and 7) give the kernel additional instructions every time you boot. You can ignore grub for now and tell it to do this manually if you prefer to do that as a test. I'm not sure where \"fglrx-updates come in\". The importance of use_sabi=1 was determined later in the same forum thread.\nI hope this helps somehow and good luck.

I've recently switched from Ubuntu 10.04 LTS to 12.04 LTS, and one of the changes i have noticed is that when i try to run the command ifconfig (for example to view my own ip), i get the following output:\n\nCommand 'ifconfig' is available in '/sbin/ifconfig'\n  The command could not be located because '/sbin' is not included in the PATH environment >variable.\n  This is most likely caused by the lack of administrative privileges associated with your >user account.\n  ifconfig: command not found\n\nIn order to run the command, i have to run sudo ifconfig.

Hopefully someone else running Ubuntu 12.04 can try running the command and see if they get the same result as me. \n\nA: As the message says, the problem is that ifconfig is not in your path. You can run it as a normal user by giving the full path: /sbin/ifconfig. Try it!\nMy guess is that on 10.04 you added /sbin/ to your path, and didn't do that when upgrading to 12.04.\nNote, however, that you will need to be root if you want to use ifconfig to change networking configurations; I hope the reasons for this are more than obvious :)\n\nA: Add /sbin to PATH env var:\nexport PATH=\"$PATH:/sbin\"\n\n", "Q: can I upgrade wubi from 11.10 to 12.04 \nPossible Duplicate:\nUpgrading my Wubi 11.04 to 11.10 \n\nI already have wubi installed with ubuntu 11.10, but want to upgrade it to 12.04 LTS.

I want to have an inverse color effect (light to dark)  like 'negative' in compiz, but without compiz, and only for one window (like compiz's Super+N) . \nIs there a way to get a similar effect (toggled by a key combo preferably) without compiz?  I can invert colors for the entire desktop with xcalib -I -a, but I can't restrict it to a single window.\n\nA: As far as I know... to achieve that, you will need help of a Window Compositor.\nYou can try to install a lightweight standalone compositor like Compton.\nCompton\n\nCompton is a lightweight compositor for X, and a fork of\n  xcompmgr-dana.\n\nAccording to the Man Pages Compton has an option to invert colors in a window.\ne.g:\ncompton --invert-color-include <CONDITION>\n\nThe condition could be the WM_CLASS of a window, to find the \"WM_CLASS\" in a window you can run the command xprop\n\n\n*\n\n*xprop | grep WM_CLASS\nThen the cursor will be a \"Cross\" and you can click in the window you want, to find the WM_CLASS.\nNow you should have something like this:\n\nWM_CLASS(STRING) = \"leafpad\", \"Leafpad\"\n\n\nThe second string should be the WM_CLASS \"Leafpad\".\nSo, to invert the colors of the Leafpad editor you should run:\n\n\n*\n\n*compton --invert-color-include 'class_g=\"Leafpad\"'\nIn some cases, you might want to invert only some windows of a program (e.g. invert the editor window, but not the \"save file\" dialog).\nFor that you can use the first of the two WM_CLASS strings (also called the \"instance\"):\n\n\n*\n\n*compton --invert-color-include '(class_g=\"Leafpad\" && class_i=\"leafpad\")'\nYou do not need to run compton all the time, you can run it when you need to invert the colors of a window.\n\nNOTE: In this example I'm running Lubuntu 13.04 with openbox as window manager but without compositor by default.\n\nTo install Compton\nThis compositor has it own PPA\n1) To install compton open a Terminal and type:\n\n\n*\n\n*sudo add-apt-repository ppa:richardgv/compton\n\n*sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install compton\nIn this example I will create a basic Bash script (I am not an expert in scripts) to detect the active window and invert its colors.\n2) Create the script.\n\n\n*\n\n*sudo apt-get install xdotool\n\n*mkdir ~/Scripts\n\n*nano ~/Scripts/invert.sh\nThe content of the script:\n#! /bin/bash\n\nif [ \"$(pidof compton)\" ];\n    then\n            pkill compton\n    else\n\n        ID=$(xdotool getactivewindow)\n        CLASS=$(xprop -id \"$ID\"  | grep \"WM_CLASS\" | awk '{print $4}')\n        COND=\"class_g=${CLASS}\"\n        compton --invert-color-include \"$COND\" &\nfi\nexit\n\n\n\nBasically  the script will check if compton is running, if it not\n  running xdotool will find the window id of the active window, with the id xprop will find\n  the WM_CLASS, then with the WM_CLASS it will create the condition and\n  finally will run compton with the condition as argument.\n\nMake the script executable.\n\n\n*\n\n*chmod +x ~/Scripts/invert.sh\nIn my case I will create a soft link to the /usr/bin/ directory with the name \"invert-color\"\n\n\n*\n\n*sudo ln -s ~/Scripts/invert.sh /usr/bin/invert-color\n3) create a Keyboard Shortcut e.g:  Ctrl+Alt+U (In Lubuntu you should edit the lubuntu-rc.xml file)\n\n\n*\n\n*leafpad ~/.config/openbox/lubuntu-rc.xml\nAdd the following Lines:\n\n<!-- Launch invert-color activewindow on Ctrl + Alt + U-->\n<keybind key=\"C-A-U\">\n  <action name=\"Execute\">\n    <command>invert-color</command>\n  </action>\n</keybind>\n\n\nFinally you can Logout and Login to see the changes in the keyboard shortcut.\n\nMy intention is when I need to invert the colors in the active window I can do it with the Shortcut  Ctrl+Alt+U.If I want to go back to the normal colors I will press again the shortcut and the script will detect the compton is running therefore the pkill command will kill the process compton.\nSo in this way I will only run the compositor when I need it.\nHere you have a few screenshots:\n\n\n\n\nHope it helps.\n\nA: A Gnome Shell Extension \"Invert Window Color\" does this without any hassle.

I did an 'apt-get remove' on a whole bunch of packages including zip, curl, libx11-dev, libglib2.0-dev, etc. and, after I did that, nearly all of my applications have silently disappeared (I believe that that is what caused it although I'm not 100%... I also uninstalled my python installation and did some other stuff before I finally went to go and open a program [terminal] and found that most of my programs were gone including ubuntu software center, etc... basically nearly everything). Does anyone know what may have caused this or, better, how to refresh everything?  (no, I didn't create a restore point  :-(  )  Or, am I hosed?\n\nA: Software-center depends on python. you may want to try installing (or reinstalling) the ubuntu-desktop meta package, this should get you back basic essentials,\nsudo apt-get install ubuntu-desktop\nif it is allready insalled remove it ( sudo apt-get remove ubuntu-desktop ) then install it, don't worry it's a meta package, that is used to install and update a set of packages, What exactly is in ubuntu-desktop? \n\nA: That's easy to recover ;-P\nFirst , find out all what you just removed by:\ngrep remove /var/log/dpkg.log\nAnd re-install things needed by\nsudo apt-get install XX\nDon't care about dependencies , just find the packages you need , they will be installed automatically. \n\nA: Your programs weren't 'silently' removed. Packages in Ubuntu have 'dependencies', other packages that need to be installed for them to function properly. The Ubuntu Software Centre depends on Python, so when you uninstalled Python, Software Centre was also removed because it wouldn't have worked without its dependencies.\napt-get does warn you when it's going to remove packages like this. Next time you're removing things with apt-get remove, read over the lists of packages that are going to be removed. Any extra packages that will be uninstalled that you didn't specify will be listed under a heading like \"The following extra packages will be uninstalled:\".

Is it better to set this to my server's domain name? If so, how do I change it? I'm running Ubuntu 12.04 and Postfix. Thanks.\n\nA: The intended goal of the post owner is to know how to set the Helo Address in Postfix config and to know at what value it is best to set it. I'll make the hypothesis that by best, we should uderstand the value that will give my mail the greatest chance to be accepted on delivery.\nThe helo line is controlled by the smtp_helo_name parameter. It, by default, references the myhostname parameter.\nsmtp_helo_name = $myhostname\n\nIn order to pass the spf_helo test, you'll need to have a corresponding SPF record in your DNS for the address smtp_helo_name references.\nIf you already have configured such SPF record for your domain, a straigthforward way to achieve SPF helo check is to use the domain as helo name:\nsmtp_helo_name = $mydomain\n\nBut it is best practice to set it to the fully qualified domain name of the emitting host. This requires to have a SPF for that FQDN hostname in your DNS.\nNote: The following holds for a single domain, just replace all occurrences of  domainB with domainA. If domainA serves other domains, configure them similar to what is done for domainB.\nFor example suppose that the DNS for domainB.tld contains the following:\n                       600 IN TXT    \"v=spf1 mx -all\"\n                           IN MX     mx.domainA.tld\n\ni.e. domainA hosts the SMTP server of domainB: mx.domainA.tld.\nThen domainA DNS zone must contain a SPF record for host mx, along with the corresponding record that resolves to the IP address, for example:\nmx                     600 IN TXT    \"v=spf1 a -all\"\nmx                     600 IN A      A.B.C.D\n\nthen if myhostname references mx.domainA.tld you can let smtp_helo_name to its default value (i.e. myhostname) or you can configure it as needed.\nThen reload postfix configuration (systemctl reload postfix).\npostfixsmtpspfehlohelo\n\nA: You can change it in postfix configuration file /etc/postfix/main.cf.\nThe helo line is controlled by the smtpd_banner parameter. It probably references the myhostname option. Put your server name there instead of localhost:\nmyhostname = server.example.com\nsmtpd_banner = $myhostname\n\nand restart postfix with sudo postfix reload.\n", "Q: I am not able to delete a corrupt NTFS  partition on my pen drive.

As another answer has pointed out, you want to have no doubt that you are erasing the correct device. (I would probably run the command sudo fdisk -l as an extra check.)\nThe dd command below should write zeros to the first MiB of the pen drive which will erase any partition table. This should completely remove any partitioning.\nsudo dd if=/dev/zero bs=1M count=1 of=/dev/sdb\n\nIf you decide you want to write zeros to the entire device, just omit the count=1 parameter. This will take longer, of course. How much longer depends on the size of the pen drive you are erasing.\nsudo dd if=/dev/zero bs=1M of=/dev/sdb\n\n\nAfter you have erased the partition table with zeros, you can partition the drive. I would do this using gparted simply because I am familiar with that tool and know how to use it.\nHere is how I would do it.\n\n\n*\n\n*If gparted is not already available on your system, install it. You could, for example, use the command below.\nsudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get -y install gparted\n\n*Start gparted, entering your password when it is requested.\n\n*Perform the following steps.\n\n\n*\n\n*Select the pen drive as the current gparted device.\n\n*Select the free space region on the pen drive.\n\n*Select Create Partition Table in the Device menu and create an MS-DOS style partition table.\n\n*Select New in the Partition menu to create a new primary partition on the pen drive. Or if you prefer, you could close gparted at this point and use fdisk to partition the pen drive.\n\n\n\n\n\nNote:\nIf you wanted to do this in Windows I suggest using the DISKPART command in a command window. Once in DISKPART select the correct disk and then issue the command CLEAN. \n(You can issue the command HELP CLEAN while in DISKPART form more information about what the command does.)\n\nA: Assuming your pen drive is /dev/sdd (please make sure you know which it is)\nopen a terminal\n'sudo fdisk /dev/sdd'\ndelete the ntfs partition, and make a new one (or any other type of partition)\n'd'\nshould automagically destroy the only partition.\nat this point you can hit 'w' and write the changes and use your fav method of making a new partition.

I recently did a fresh install of Ubuntu 12.04. I did it on a 16GB USB flash drive, with 964MB for swap and 13.97GB for ext3.\nSystem specs:\n\n\n*\n\n*2GB DDR2 RAM (800~ frequency range)\n\n*3.14GHz single core processor\n\n*ATI 3600 graphics card\n\n\nThis is the first time I have gotten Ubuntu installed on a USB flash drive (I had another Ubuntu installed on hard drive). The Ubuntu I had on the hard drive worked marvellously faster than my Windows 7; for example, I could be running Google Chrome with around twenty tabs and have Photoshop running without any lag. But now with the USB version I can barely have Google Chrome open with six tabs and browse my home folder at the same time without lag, and freezing of either Chrome or the home folder.\nThis is a picture of top being used in the terminal:\n\nSo could you please help me? Any suggestions will be helpful.\n\nA: Where USB flash drives fail is in random writes to the disk.  They can be hundreds of times slower than the same operation on traditional hard drives.  Note that this used to be the case with SSDs too until around 2008 or 2009 when they gained new controller technologies which make them much faster than tradtional hard drives.  These technologies pretty much don't exist on USB flash drives.\nOperations that will be particularly slow include:\n\n*\n\n*Installing new packages, or doing system updates.  Expect these to be tens of times slower than traditional hard drives, maybe even 1000s of times slower than SSDs.  Upgrading between Ubuntu versions could take several hours or more.\n\n*General browser use, given that your browser caches files to disk all the time.\n\n*Operations which involve copying or moving/altering hundreds of small files.\n\nThis article on phoronix compares the performance of various file systems on USB flash drives.  Unfortunately, its conclusion is that it doesn't make all that much difference.  Theoretically, a log-structured file system should help, but these aren't mainstream enough for me to recommend them for the uninitiated.\nOne idea is to use a read-only or hybrid file-system instead, which is exactly what you get if you copy the Ubuntu Live CD image (or use UNetBootin to set up a live USB) to your USB flash drive.  Look into setting up a Live USB from the Live CD image with persistence (try to find a recent guide to doing so).  Of course, you then won't be able to upgrade to a new version of Ubuntu, but that's not necessarily terrible.\nBarring any such measures, and keeping a traditional partition type/structure, your main strategy will be to try and minimise writes to the disk at all cost.  Ideas for this include:\n\n*\n\n*Disable journalling on ext4 or set your partitions to \"writeback\" mode.  The drawback to this is that it increases the chances and severity of data loss or corruption in the case of accidental power loss, crash or simply unplugging the drive while it's being used.\n\n*Disable swap, though on a system with sufficient RAM this actually will have much less of an effect than you expect, and on a system with insufficient RAM may cause stability problems.\n\n*Try to minimise on-disk caching by various programs, such as your browser.  Reducing the size of the disk cache is not necessarily enough: turning it off all together and using a memory cache (if possible) is much better.  If you have lots of RAM, you could try using a tmpfs mount (like a disk partition in RAM) for various tmp and cache directories.\n\n\nA: My answer/suggestion is to avoid expecting too much from USB speed. I think you misunderstood what swap is for. It won't speed up your system to keep swap on your USB since accessing data from USB runs terribly slow when compared to accessing it from HD. Don't forget that most of system data are being kept in RAM when you start OS from memory stick, so running swap from USB makes USB<->RAM data transmission even slower.\nUbuntu will always work much slower from USB stick than from HDD, creating swap wont force Ubuntu to stop using RAM.\n\nA: Use Puppy Linux; there is one called \"Precise Puppy\", based on Ubuntu. Most of it is in memory and it saves a file, settings etc. on the drive everytime you reboot. Works way faster. Would prefer Ubuntu on a flash drive also, but Puppy works good – fits on a 4GB flash drive with plenty of room to spare.\nAdd Chrome or Firefox with sync and the programs you need – works great. It's pretty easy to remaster a new version once you get it how you like it, kinda like Ubuntu UCK, but way easier (less to set up).\nMost deb files work on it: VLC, Chrome, Firefox, Nero 4, Deluge, Transmission... pretty much plays all media files out of the box.\nThey make some smaller distros especially for running off a USB flash drive so makes it way easier.\n\nA: On my laptop it was the old BIOS at fault.\nI used Plop Boot Manager on CD to boot from the USB stick.\nBoot speed increased a lot, something like five times.\n(Also wireless connects faster after boot if the boot is fast.)\nSpeed increases because a Linux kernel boots a Linux USB stick.\nNot the BIOS.\n", "Q: How do I return to default wallpaper on login screen in LightDM? With the change to 12.04 came the new feature of having the login screen matching the selected user's wallpaper. It's a cool feature, but not for everyone. I'd like to go the other way and go back to having a default login screen (lightDM) wallpaper that doesn't change to match the selected User's wallpaper. Is this possible?\n\nA: If you're using one of the stock wallpapers I don't know of a way to do it, but I don't see why you'd want to hide any of those, as they're pretty innocuous :)\nIf it's an image in a user's home directory, you could try changing it so it can only be read by that particular user: right-click on the file, select Properties, then Permissions, and set \"Access\" for both Group and World to \"None\". The login manager should then be unable to read the image and will show a default image instead.\n\nA: You might try downloading/installing Ubuntu Tweak. There is an option to select a wallpaper for the login screen (Tweaks>Login Settings). If your custom-selected image doesn't display afterwards, you may need to sudo copy it into the /usr/share/backgrounds directory, then right-click change the permissions to match the default wallpapers.\nI hope that works like what you've got in mind. Take care.\n", "Q: How do I add a keyboard model to Ubuntu and give back that model to the community? Hey I have new Lenovo z570 laptop recently. It has a unique keyboard. I am able to use it but not to its full capabilities. I am unable to map some of the 'extra' keys to their respective functions. There is no separate keyboard model for lenovo z570. I would like to configure this keyboard properly and give back to the ubuntu repos for storage so that later someone else using the same laptop can use my configuration that I have set. \nHow do I do that?\n\nA: Creating a Modified Keymap and Submitting it to the Ubuntu Project\nIt's great that you are thinking about helping other users of your computer. Here are some steps you can take.\nI'll try to give you an outline of the steps needed. The details will depend upon what your computer needs.\nCreating a Modified Keymap\nThe detailed directions for defining a custom keyboard for Ubuntu are here. I would suggest copying your existing keyboard file to a new name and then modifying that file to add and modify what is needed. You can do this with gksudo gedit /usr/share/X11/xkb/symbols/old-name, and make the changes in your editor. Then save them under a new name.\nIf you forget you can reinstall the xkb-data package.\nActivating and Testing the Modified Keymap\nGo to System Settings and Select the Keyboard control panel. At the bottom select Layout Settings. Then you can click on the + icon on the lower left to add your new file to the menu, select it, and test it.\nContributing to Ubuntu\nIf you don't have one, you should get a Launchpad account. Go to launchpad and click at the top right corner to create one. Otherwise please log in.\nThe next step is to go here and make sure someone hasn't already filed a report. Assuming that's not the case, report the problem that the default keyboard is not adequate for the Lenovo z570 and mention why.\nPlease attach the file you have created to the bug.\nI'd suggest coming back here and providing the link to the bug report. That way others who recognize your question here as their problem can go to the bug report and click on the link that says that the bug affects them.\nHelping Even More People\nYou can go farther than this by checking out this link to the launchpad page for the upstream of this package. Clicking on the Bugs tag shows problems in the upstream package Launchpad knows about. It also shows that Freedesktop keeps a bug reporting system for upstream.\nMost distributions of Linux probably use this upstream package, so your contribution can go farther once it has been contributed there. Ubuntu doesn't just serve as a way to help its own users, it contributes back to upstream developers such as those at Debian and Freedesktop to help non-Ubuntu users. \nYou can click on the link Bugs are tracked in freedesktop.org Bugzilla. at the top to go to the Freedesktop bug reporting system and send them your bug report and new keymap file. Once you do that you should go back to your Launchpad bug report and add that the bug affects the upstream package and put a link to your upstream bug report there. That way Ubuntu developers will know that they don't have to do this themselves.\nI can see that the Ubuntu X team is busy at work preparing Quantal, so this is probably a good time to make a contribution. Their mailing list is at ubuntu-x@lists.ubuntu.com and I'm sure they hang out on IRC as well.\n\nA: I suppose you create a new layout for your keyboard using xkb configuration files.\nTo do this go to:\n/usr/share/X11/xkb/symbols\n\nHere, you can see keyboard layouts configurations by country abbreviations. For instance, layouts for English US are in \"us\" file. In this file, you can define what should happen if a key is pressed in different situations.\nI suggest you look at the us file and try to play with keys until you get the hang of it, and then create your own custom mapping.\nYou can see a more complete how-to in:\nhttp://www.dotkam.com/2007/06/25/custom-keyboard-layout-in-ubuntu-or-just-linux-2/\n\nA: You could try asking an established Launchpad user to add them, or if you can code, access the Bazaar branch corresponding to this code, and propose a change there. You may need to join the respective group first, but you may be able to suggest the code without a group membership. Somebody will need to commit it for you, though.\n", "Q: Why can't I raise the priority level in 12.04 in gnome-system-monitor When I go to raise a priority level it displays this\n\nI know it says permission denied, but is this a bug?

If not, you can get an estimate of your speed by visiting this test site.\nIf you can edit the question to include your country of residence, a server (mirror) closer to you can be recommended, which may be faster.\n\nA: My Suggestion would be to use the combination\nfirefox web browser and the DownthemAll firefox plugin.\nI have been using the combination for a while and so far is quite fast and you have the option of pausing your downloads and most other cool options\n\nA: I find the bit torrent downloads to be MUCH faster than the direct links.\nCheck out http://www.ubuntu.com/download/desktop/alternative-downloads and select the desktop version you need (i386 is 32bit ubuntu; amd64 is 64bit ubuntu).\n\nA: You may need a multi-thread download utility, like axel. Or P2P download software, such as BitTorrent, eMule. After you have installed the basic Ubuntu system, you may also try apt-fast to download individiual packages faster.\n\nA: You can download the iso directly from Ubuntu.com.

(How to get Ubuntu back after installing Windows?) \n\nI installed Ubuntu 12.04 alongside Windows 7. I then fiddled around with EasyBCD and managed to stuff up the boot info and Windows wouldn't boot, etc. \nI then repaired Windows via an install CD but now I don't have an option to boot into Ubuntu, it boots straight into Windows.\nHow do I boot into Ubuntu now?\n\nA: The only problem is the MBR section which now has replaced windows. Whenever you repair windows, it repairs MBR and uninstall the GRUB or whatever is written on it. So now your GRUB is not in the MBR and it directly boots you into windows. \nTo repair GRUB, you can use any live cd to boot into ubuntu and open up terminal and then issue the command sudo grub-install . Well, in many cases, that fails. For that, you have to manually mount the root partition and then re-install the GRUB into it. It follows as:\nsudo fdisk -l \n...list of devices and partions\n//here find out the root partition (mine is sda3, so i am condireing /dev/sda3 here)\n\nsudo mkdir /mnt/anyname\nsudo mount /dev/sda3 /mnt/anyname\ncd /mnt/anyname\nsudo grub-install --root-directory=/mnt/anyname /dev/sda\n\nThis will re-install your GRUB. If you are encountering any problem in installing the GRUB, just go to google, there are millions of guides on \"installing the grub in linux\". :)\n\nA: In addition to @ashutosh answer, you can use a graphical utility called Boot Repair to re-install Ubuntu bootloader:\n\n\n*\n\n*Article in Ubuntu Wiki\n\n*Article on WebUpd8\nPicture: \nThere's also a detailed article in Ubuntu wiki which lists different ways of recovering the bootloader after installing Windows\n\nA: Maybe you should read this:\nhttp://neosmart.net/wiki/display/EBCD/Ubuntu  and start from the \"Adding Ubuntu to the Windows Bootloader\"  part.\nThis worked for me.\n\nA: Ubuntu's installation replaces the win7 bootloader in the boot sector. It prompts you to choose which system you want to start each time. I recommend Debian if you want to run two or more operating systems on one machine. You should try to make the system swap area about 2 GB as well, because that could lead to system freezing in the boot section, I think. \n\nA: The same thing happened to me and I just reinstalled ubuntu after fixing windows.

Be sure to protect any script files which use\n  this switch.\n\nHope this helps.\n\nA: In my case, -auth=ID:PASS didn't work.\nSo I used this:\nlynx -cmd_log=/home/luk/lynxScript.lys -accept_all_cookies www.webside.com/auth\n\nThen logged in, with a password.\nAs a result (save in the file lynxScript.lys), I got all the commands executed when logging in.\nNow I could use this:\nlynx -cmd_script=/home/luk/lynxScript.lys -accept_all_cookies www.webside.com/auth\n\n\n*\n\n*-cmd_log - saves your actions.\n\n*-cmd_script - plays the recorded actions.\n\nSo with -cmd_log and -cmd_script, you can do everything you want on the webpage.\n\nA: It depends on what login mechanism the website uses, because there is no standard.\nMost websites today use cookies. So basically you have to automatically fill in the login form, submit it, and store the cookie you get in return. Then you have to use that cookie in subsequent access to the site.\ncurl is a good tool for this. You have to write a script where you first call\ncurl -c /tmp/cookiefile -d login_field_name=login -d password_field_name=password https://site.domain/path/to/login\n\nOf course login_field_name, password_field_name and https://site.domain/path/to/login (and maybe other parameters needed by login form) are things you must read from the page source.\nAfter this succeeds, authentication cookie will be stored in /tmp/cookiefile, and you have to use it for subsequent accesses to the site:\ncurl -b /tmp/cookiefile http://site.domain/path/to/whatever/you/need\n\n\nA: You can use python with mechanize and http.cookiejar, e.g.:\n#!/usr/bin/env python3\n\nimport mechanize\nimport http.cookiejar\n\ncj = http.cookiejar.CookieJar()\nbr = mechanize.Browser()\nbr.set_cookiejar(self.cj)\n\nbr.open(\"http://www.example.com/\")\nbr.select_form(id=\"loginform\")\nbr.form[\"username\"] = \"myuser\"\nbr.form[\"password\"] = \"mypassword\"\nbr.submit()\n\n# from now on, all requests to example.com uses your logged in user\nbr.open(\"http://www.example.com/some_acces_restricted_page\") \n\nWhere br.select_form in the example uses the id from <form id=\"loginform\"> and username are the respective names of the fields within this form.\n", "Q: download c compiler to ubuntu How can I download  PIC18 v3.38 in Lite mode as C-Compiler to Mplab ? I could not see any link to repository. \nCan I download it with sudo apt-get install ?\nNote : I am not using wine\n   ubuntu 10.04\n\n\nA: Just to be correct: GCC stands for \"GNU Compiler Collection\" and does not compile binaries for PIC Microcontrollers. \nThe PIC18 compiler can be downloaded from the MPLAB site: \nTo my knowledge it is Windows only and does not work with Wine. You might have to use another compile such as the HI-TECH C Compiler for PIC10/12/16\nAlso see Programming PIC's in Linux.\n", "Q: Replace Realtek r8168 network card to enable wake-on-lan? I've been struggling with wake-on-lan (WoL) capability of my onboard Realtek RTL8111/8168B ethernet controller (MB: Gigabyte Z68AP-D3) for almost a week now. The main issue seems to be that network card is switched off completely during shutdown (i.e., both link and (act)ivity LED lights are off).\nI made an extensive review of similar issues and tried the following (among others):\n\n\n*\n\n*Putting ethtool -s eth0 wol g to rc.local file.\n\n*Installing latest r8168 driver(s) from Realtek.\n\n*Putting echo -n \"my_lan_id\" >> /proc/acpi/wakeup to rc.local file.\n\n*Switching WOL option on and off in BIOS.\n\n\nI can find no way to prepare my NIC to work properly so I decided to try with external PCI network card. Please suggest me which network card should I try to enable WoL? (Maybe Intel® PRO/1000 GT Desktop Adapter?)\n\nA: I found a solution, it works on my system (RTL8111/8168B PCI Express Gigabit Ethernet + Ubuntu 12.04 AMD64). This bug report discribes the issue, and someone suggested that using the r8168 module instead of the r8169 module would do the trick. Also somewhere else I saw this can be done via dkms, but I'm in a rush this morning, so didn't get chance to look, this might help\nwget http://r8168.googlecode.com/files/r8168-8.030.00.tar.bz2\ntar xjf r8168-8.030.00.tar.bz2\ncd r8168-8.030.00\n./autorun.sh\n\nAlthough I was doing this over ssh, it actually worked, the connection just locked for a while, but picked up again after the new module installed.\n\nA: The LED doesn't necessarily have to be lit for the NIC to be listening to WOL, this is a common misconception. It depends on the NIC. I have a Windows PC where the LAN LED is out even though WOL works for it. Also, looking for attached devices in a router's i/f might not show truthfully if the NIC is listening for WOL or not. I have a PC which is not visible in the router's i/f when in sleep but WOL works. So all in all I don't think there's any good way to check if NIC is listening or completely shut down.\nI posted my problem & investigation here, it could be the same problem:\nWake-on-LAN worked 3 times then no more\nMy main suspicion righ now is that this problem occurs for RTL8111 users with Ubuntu 12.04. \nThere are also actually different version of RTL8111, who knows if it applies to all, and I don't know what the differences are between 8111C, 8168B, 8169 etc, they use the same driver on Linux. On Realtek's site, the same driver is used for the following NICs:\nRTL8111B/RTL8168B/RTL8111/RTL8168 --\nRTL8111C/RTL8111CP/RTL8111D(L) --\nRTL8168C/RTL8111DP/RTL8111E --\nRTL8168E/RTL8111F/RTL8411 \nand a different driver for the following NICs:\nRTL8110SC(L) (RTL8110S/RTL8110SB(L)/RTL8169SB(L)/RTL8169S(L)/RTL8169)\nNot allowed to post any more links.. :-/\nIf you want to buy a different NIC I suggest non-Realtek i e any Intel chip.\nUpdate: I tested some more to understand what the problem is. My main theories for now ar: Ubuntu system shuts down NIC power in standby mode, and/or Realtek RTL8111 driver for 64-bit machines does not work. See link to my thread for details.\nBTW I don't get this forum.. Am I posting an answer and the other ones are discussing although not allowed?! And I'm allowed to change the original post but can't add a comment!\n\nA: In addition to turning on support for wake-on-lan in the BIOS, I had to make another BIOS change.\nIn the BIOS, under \"Power Management, I set \"Deep Sleep Control\" to disabled.\nThat allowed the NIC to stay on and show a link light even when the PC was off.\n", "Q: dpkg: error: duplicate file trigger interest for filename `/usr/lib/gio/modules' and package `libglib2.0-0:i386' I had very similar issue which was described in this question - \nWhy this dpkg error: ambiguous package name 'libglib2.0-0' ...?.

I plan to do it with my 4 gb pen drive. What the problem is that I want to have both the bootable windows installer AND ubuntu installer together. (Because once I install windows I'd be formatting my drive and reserving space for the subsequent ubuntu install and I cannot make a bootable ubuntu) Is there a way to make a bootbale pen drive which would install windows and ubuntu both?\nPS: The windows iso is 2 gigs and the ubuntu one is like 700 mb, so it should fit in the pen drive, right?\n\nA: OK, so I found the best possible easiest solution there is.\nSimply download and install Yumi Multiboot installer in windows. Download here.\nFollow the instructions and keep your iso s handy.\nAfter installation of one OS installer is done, you may proceed to install another. This was probably the easiest solution I could find. And now I have a 4g gig pen drive with windows 7 and ubuntu 12.04 installer.\nCheers!\n\nA: You really might want to install Windows first and let it do it's own thing.  Then use the capability of the Ubuntu installer to create the space you require dynamically and do a proper dual boot installation.  As you have to boot the USB you can only boot one image or the other, so I would say your suggestion is a non-starter.\n\nA: It's totally doable. Use grub4dos. Follow this tutorial to put Windows 7 on that stick: http://windows7forums.com/windows-7-installation-upgrade/44151-tips-using-grub4dos-install-windows-7-usb-pendrive.html\nYou can mount/extract windows 7 ISO under Linux and copy its content onto the flash drive.\nThen go here to prep you flashdrive for Ubuntu - you can either have it as a persistent, or live, read-only version, just read the guide: http://www.rmprepusb.com/tutorials/ubuntu\nThe last thing to do is to install the bootloader, which can be done either from Windows (using RMPrepUSB as described in step 3 of that Ubuntu installation tutorial above), or from Linux.\nIf you want to do it using Linux, then download this zip: https://code.google.com/p/grub4dos-chenall/downloads/detail?name=grub4dos-0.4.5c-2012-04-24.7z&can=2&q= extract it and execute bootlace.com file like so: ./bootlace.com /dev/sdX (where /dev/sdX is you flash drive), then copy the file called grldr to the root of your flash, unmount it and you should be good to go :)\n\nA: You would have to be pretty savvy but, with a little homework, I bet you could pull it off using this...\nhttp://www.pendrivelinux.com/multiboot-create-a-multiboot-usb-from-linux/\n...or if you want to make the multi-boot using windows...\nhttp://www.pendrivelinux.com/xboot-multiboot-iso-usb-creator/\n....you can even use the remaining 1Gb+- as a persistent 'micro'hard-drive for linux... \n....The second option is probably your best bet (as stated above, you'll want to install windows first). Using this method still requires you to install one OS/distro at a time but, that's a small price to pay for a sweet hack. If it works, let us know. Have fun 8^)\n....This kind of talk makes me want a desktop and a laptop, with identical dual-boot installs and, I want them to sync quietly and automatically when they get within blue-tooth range of each other.

If this fails, then 12.04 is not appropriate on your hardware.  Wubi installations do run more slowly that native installations.  The symptoms you are getting suggest that 12.04 is not compatible with your video controller, but booting into 'Try Ubuntu' will test this for you.  If you want to come back to us, please give hardware information including your video controller spec and which version of Microsoft Windows you are running.\n", "Q: SSD over USB drive Server I'm thinking upgrading my Server USB drive to a SSD where it will be installed Ubuntu 12.04 and i was wondering if there will be any improvement over the USB ?\nThanks\n\nA: It depends on what sort of USB connection you are talking about.  If your enclosure only supports USB 2.0, then the maximum speed you can talk to the drive will be 60 megabytes a second.  This is the maximum speed: if anything else is using that USB bus, then performance may be lower.\nTo put this in perspective, OCZ sells solid state drives with maximum speeds ranging from 250 megabytes per second (a slow, high capacity drive) to 550 megabytes per second (a high performance, lower capacity drive).\nSo a USB 2.0 enclosure is going to greatly constrain the performance of almost any SSD.  If you can't mount the drive internally, then an eSATA or USB 3.0 enclosure would be a better choice (assuming your system supports one of those connection methods.\n", "Q: Printer Idle status in Ubuntu 64bit with Canon LBP6000 Another Canon printer problem with Ubuntu.

The xorg.conf.d directory can be found in /usr/share/X11/. If you put an xorg.conf file in /etc/X11 then the system will pick it up though (and may also pick it up if put in /usr/share/X11 - I haven't tried this). If you have your old one you could try putting it there and seeing if that solves your problem. I have had some problems with this when setting up twinview, but it might be OK for a single monitor.\n", "Q: Installation Problem I recently installed Ubuntu 12.04 alongside Windows 7 in my laptop, I have experienced a few problems after my installation however. Firstly when I restart my computer I am not presented with the option to run Ubuntu, it just goes straight into running Windows. Secondly my hard-drive is partitioned into two, C and D, Windows is installed on C and Ubuntu got installed on D. Lastly whenever I want to run Ubuntu I have to insert the USB I used to install Ubuntu with, restart the laptop, press F12 for boot options and select the USB for me to be able to run Ubuntu, after this I can remove the USB and Ubuntu will run fine until I restart which will require me to use the USB again. I should mention that I don't know much about computers. How do I solve this problem I want to be presented with the option to run Ubuntu when I reboot and also want to install Ubuntu in C.\n\nA: If you are trying to run 2 systems you should have 4 partitions: one for windows, one for Ubuntu, one as a Swap area and one for your documents. That should keep them apart. It should work, because Ubuntu installs it's boot loader over the old one. Are you sure that you installed it correctly.If yes, you should change your boot loader to GNU GRUB. It detects all kinds of operating systems. It should do the trick for you. But research about GRUB before you try anything, because you could not be able to restore your windows boot loader after applying it. Good luck.\n", "Q: How to disable changing desktop background (wallpapers) automatically in Ubuntu 12.04? After I upgraded to the Ubuntu 12.04, it seems if I want a wallpaper, the only option is the default one, and the desktop background (wallpapers) would be changed throughout the day (once per hour). The problem is that it seems to be not very stable, especially in the case of using two monitors, it crashes during changing the wallpaper from time to time, quite annoying.\nIs there a way to disable changing desktop background (wallpapers) throughout the day in Ubuntu 12.04?\n\nA: When you right click on your desktop and select \"Change My Desktop Background\" (alternatively type \"Appearance\" in the Dash). You will see little Icons on some of the wallpaper selections.  \nThese represent the slideshow you want to remove.  Select an alternative Wallpaper (with no icon) and this effect will be removed.  See my comments above if you want to add your own wallpaper.\nFor additional information the dynamic wallpaper slideshow wallpapers are driven by the contest.xml file hosted in usr/share,backgrounds\n\nA: You should be able to use some other background. If you don't see the other standard backgrunds, click onto the little plus-icon and navigate to /usr/share/backgrounds. There you should find all standard backgrounds.\n", "Q: How can I use SSO to login to my Ubuntu machine instead of Local User Management Instead of maintaining local user accounts, I would like to be able to use Ubuntu SSO (Ubuntu One) accounts to authenticate the logins to my Ubuntu machine.\nAny chance?\n\nA: The topic was mooted at the Ubuntu Developer Summit in late 2011. OMG! Ubuntu! covered the topic. \nThe Ubuntu One team liked the idea, but there are many technical challenges before logging in with SSO credentials will be possible. Don't expect to see it anytime soon.\n", "Q: How to handle out of space errors I'm using Ubuntu installed inside windows with Wubi.\nDuring upgrade to 12.04 I came across a rather devious trap. About 25% through the installation of packages, I get the message that packages can't be installed due to lack of disk space on /usr. And of course, its down to 140M when I check.\nSo what to do? Can't interrupt, can't continue. Since I have a huge disk that seems accessible, which is /host, namely the USB HDD I have Ubuntu installed on, I figure what the heck, perhaps I can copy over some files there and then make links to them in /usr. So I tried sudo mv /usr/lib /host/usr, but all this did was cause error messages and leave the files in place, while creating copies in /host/usr, a behaviour I found oddly disconcerting: What happened? Did some files get moved and some not? \nSo I figured, perhaps I can check and see if I can remove some stuff with apt-get, but that gave the error that there was a lock on the dpkg something or other, \"perhaps it is used by another process?\".\nWhat's left to do? I clicked through the warnings of packages not being installed and rebooted, and now startup is aborted and I end up at the text-only login prompt.\nSo, my installation is screwed, I'll probably just reinstall and do it without Wubi this time. \nMy question is two-fold:\n\n\n*\n\n*Why wouldn't an installation process check disk space required before I click ok? Especially when it cannot be interrupted.\n\n*Is there a way to get around these kind of traps, where you need space now. What tricks are there?\n\n\nA: Upgrade manager running out of space\nAs mentioned in comment, this is a bug. This isn't supposed to happen. Make sure you have 3GB or more before running the upgrade.\nFreeing up space while the upgrade is running\nYou can't use apt-get since the update-manager is already holding the package locks. You also can't manually delete the package cache since it's probably got all the packages in it you've just downloaded.\nAll you can do is move personal data and manually delete non-essential files:\n\n\n*\n\n*Move personal data from Documents, Pictures etc. to /host\n\n*Delete large files in Downloads e.g. ISOs\n\n*Clear your browser cache manually e.g. ~/.mozilla/firefox/Cache or ~/cache/google-chrome/Default/Cache. This can free up 1GB sometimes.\n\n*Manually remove older kernels by looking in /boot and deleting all but the latest vmlinuz-..., initrd.img-..., System.map-..., abi-... and config-... (this can free up a couple of hundred MB if you have a lot of old kernels).\n\n*Use the disk usage analyzer to look for large logfiles or hidden data that you can delete or move.\n\n\nI still think this is simply a bug that must be fixed, rather than trying to find a solution. Running around deleting or moving data isn't a really great solution (and obviously carries some risk if you accidentally remove something essential or of personal value.\n", "Q: Record TV program from VLC I am using VLC 2.0.1 to watch TV (DVB-T) through my PCI TV tuner\nIs it possible to record a TV programm as an .avi or .mp4 file? Can I record it with VLC or another app?\n\nA: The easiest way to record immediately is by pressing the record button:\n\nTo enable it click View → Advanced Controls.\nRecords become stored as .ts files which you can watch with VLC. You find them in ~/Downloads, which you can change.\n\nTo cut .ts files I recommend DVBcut : DVBcut is a Qt application that allows you to select certain parts of an MPEG transport stream (as received via Digital Video Broadcasting, DVB) and save these parts into a single MPEG output file. It follows a 'keyhole surgery' approach where the input video and audio data is mostly kept unchanged, and only very few frames at the beginning and/or end of the selected range are re-encoded in order to obtain a valid MPEG file.\nBy that tool you can export the files to .mpeg without worrying about any audio lag. Information about how to use it you find on it's homepage (see wiki question).\n\nTo record an mpeg-stream use this command in a terminal:\ncvlc dvb-t:// :dvb-frequency=$FREQUENCY :dvb-bandwidth=$BANDWIDTH :program=$PROGRAM :sout=~/Videos/record.mpg --no-sout-display\n\nTake the parameters from your channels.conf, whereat $PROGRAM in each case is the last number of the line. If you want to watch your record at the same time replace the last parameter with --sout-display. To stop the record kill the process with Ctrl+C or close the terminal.\nI tested to replace .mpg with .avi and .mp4 without success: One then has a shift of sound and the other doesn't record sound. But using .mpg seems to be an acceptable alternative to .ts.\nYou can schedule records as .mpeg-streams as described in this post.\n\nAnother good alternative to watch TV on PC was Me TV , but since a while it seems to be buggy and doesn't work as it should - which led me to use VLC, too.\n\nA: This may be a bit of an overkill, but MythTV is an absolutely incredibly awesome thing:\n\n\n*\n\n*you can tell it once you want to record a certain show and it will find it and record it automatically. Or to record all documentaries. Or to record a first episode of all soap operas.\n\n*recorded episodes are neatly categorized in a nice UI\n\n*you can tell it to keep only 10 latest episodes of a show\n\n*you can tell it to find ad blocks so you can skip them (or maybe skip the movie and watch ads instead)\n\n*it has a separate backend which runs in the background, so you don't have to manually start anything to record a program\n\n*you can even set up your computer to wake up at night, record a show and shut down. Or you can have backend running on one machine which never shuts down and access it with multiple frontends installed on all your home PCs.\n\n*you can set up access to your MythTV via a web browser so you can manage recordings over Internet\n\n\n\nThere's a separate distribution of Ubuntu called Mythbuntu installing which would make sense if you're building a dedicated media center, but you can also install MythTV in \"normal\" Ubuntu\n\nA: Tools > Preferences > Input & Codecs look at files section for record directory.  I created a folder, but you need to at least your home directory.\nWhen you are ready to record, you have to press Shift+R. I mourn the loss of the red button, but you can look at the hotkeys section of preferences and see the record sequence.\n", "Q: watchdog/0 process using all my CPU suddenly I have a fresh installation of Ubuntu 12.04, I have been running it for about a week.  Suddenly today I noticed my computer freezes every 5 seconds. I restarted the computer and I still get this.  I believe it is a process called watchdog/0 that is using all the resources.  See the attached pictures.\nHow can I stop this?  I can barely use my computer like this.\n\n\nUPDATE\nWell I just did a cold reboot, (shutdown, unplug, and plug back in, and turn on) and it seems to have fixed it.  After looking at the man page for watchdog, it seems that this process may stay on during a restart?  so it is more like a soft restart?  Why that happens I don't know.\n\nA: Here's a quick summary of what it does:\nThe watchdog program writes to /dev/watchdog every ten seconds. If the device is opened but not written to within a minute, the machine will reboot. This feature is available when the kernel is built with ‘software watchdog’ support (standard in Debian kernels).\nWhile it may seem useful, it's not really that crucial for your system's reliability, moreover it tends to cause unnecessary wakeups which in turn may lead to shorter battery performance/ You can easily disable it by adding nmi_watchdog=0 to your kernel boot parameters in /etc/default/grub.\n\nA: My server is a Dell R320, 12 cores, watchdog drain CPU heavily, avg. 68% CPU usage.\nAdd following drivers to blacklist configuration file /etc/modprobe.d/blacklist.conf fixed my problem\n\nblacklist acpi_pad\nblacklist mei\nblacklist sb_edac\nblacklist i7core_edac\n\n\nA: This could be related to https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/watchdog/+bug/1010855 or https://bugzilla.kernel.org/show_bug.cgi?id=42981\nOn my system, rebooting works around the issue, but it comes back after a few hours.\n\nA: I was able to tranquilise the watchdog by stepping down with the kernel version. Therefore I had to make the grub menu visible as described in this Q&A.\nAfter choosing an earlier kernel during startup, the watchdog was calm. However, then rtkit-deamon went totally crazy eating the same amount of the CPU as the watchdog did before.\n\nA: Following this link http://osdir.com/ml/ubuntu-bugs/2013-08/msg09026.html i did following:\n1) deleted (after backing up) /lib/modules/3.13.0-24-generic/kernel/drivers/char/ipmi/ipmi_watchdog.ko\n2) commented out line in /boot/config-3.13.0-24-generic with \"IPMI\" and \"watchdog\" in it\nAnd now the problem seems to be gone.\nNote you may need to change the kernel version from 3.13.0-24-generic using the uname -r command in terminal to get the current in use kernel.\n\nA: I tried  @feifan.overflow answer, but not worked, maybe I need to reboot it to apply the changes.\nThe command below worked for me.\nI am running a Debian Wheezy on a Dell PowerEdge (seems to be some  incompatibility)\nrmmod acpi_pad\n\n", "Q: I cant install Ubuntu 12.04 First, sorry for my bad English.

You should see a welcome screen prompting you to choose your language and giving you the option to install Ubuntu or try it from the CD.\nIf your computer doesn’t automatically do so, you might need to press the F12 key to bring up the boot menu, but be careful not to hold it down - that can cause an error message.\n\nFrom: http://www.ubuntu.com/download/help/install-ubuntu-desktop\nYou can use Unetbootin or Pendrive for this.\n\nInstalling Unetbootin is very easy. You can download the 4MB unetbootin.exe and give it permission to execute as program and then make a shortcut to it. No further work necessary.

Some packages are fully supported (\"main\", \"restricted\" repos); some packages are not (\"universe\", \"multiverse\").  Also, please read the Ubuntu Updates section.  Updates are primarily used for fixing security vulnerabilities and serious bugs.  It may be that the packages you are seeing updated have more vulnerabilities/bugs than the ones you aren't seeing updated.\nThe rate of updates also depends on how quickly vulnerabilities/bugs are being fixed in the upstream codebase and the priority the package is given within Ubuntu.  E.g. since Unity is the primary Ubuntu desktop and it is a relatively new project (vs. e.g. XFCE), you will probably see more Unity-related updates than updates for other window managers.\n", "Q: Cannot install with wubi Apologies if this has been posted before, but I need some help installing 12.04 alongside windows.\nI downloaded the ISO (64 bit) then created a bootable cd with it.  Then I downloaded wubi. I proceeded to select the size of the partition (20GB) and set my username and password. \nThe installation begins, and asks me to reboot after a while.

I then get the following error:\nNo wubildr; prefix not found\n\nAt that point I'm left in what looks like a terminal or command prompt.\nHow can I make the install work?\n\nA: reinstall WUBI by this typing this on command prompt,   D:\\wubi.exe --force-wubi\n(D:\\ is where your ubuntu cd is)\nand if you are using win 7, run WUBI with administrator privilege.\n\nA: Make sure that Wubi and the .iso image is all on the hard drive of your computer. If it's on an external drive or storage it maybe will prompt you errors. Second, if you have installed Wubi previously, I suggest to uninstall it and delete files related with Wubi, as I said, move Wubi and the .iso image to the computer's hard drive (my documents, desktop, whatever) and run it from there. If this does not help you, I agree with @mahboobeAlam ... just follow the instructions on ubuntu.com of how to make a live cd or a live usb, edit bios for starting from the usb/cd and follow the instructions. You can make the partition before installing ubuntu but I would recommend not to do it and make that partition while installing Ubuntu. It's easy and it makes the dirty work for you. Good luck!\n\nA: It seems that wubi is not supported in Ubuntu 12.04.. You will have to install it from live system (boot the cd and install ubuntu alongside Windows). The best ways is that you make an empty partition with a minimum size of 15 GB on your Hard Disk and then run the ubuntu live system and run install, then select that empty partition for installation. \n", "Q: Installing packages from an .iso file I have installed Ubuntu 12.04 on a desktop system and I have an .iso file of Edubuntu 12.04, can I install Edubuntu packages in Ubuntu 12.04 from Edubuntu's iso file? That desktop system has no internet connection.\n\nA: There are many ways you can do this. Here are two:\n\n\n*\n\n*You can open the ISO file using the archive manager (right click on the file and select Open With Archive Manager). The packages are inside the pool directory.\n\n*Using the terminal, you can type this command:\nsudo mount -o loop,ro \"/path/to/the/image.iso\" \"/path/to/the/mount/point\"\n\n\"/path/to/the/image.iso\" is the location of your ISO file, while \"/path/to/the/mount/point\" is the location of an empty directory. After issuing the command, you will find the ISO files inside that directory. Again, the packages are inside pool.\nNote that the pool directory contains some core packages. Other packages are not shipped inside the CD nor in any installation (because this would double size it).\n", "Q: Xorg starts in failsafe mode when nvidia-current is active I have nvidia-current installed (version 295.40-0ubuntu1) and nvidia-current-updates (version 295.49-0ubuntu0.1) running on Ubuntu 12.04.

See Launchpad bug #980298.  Also, you state that nvidia-current-updates is 295.49, but packages.ubuntu.com seems to think that it is 295.40.  So, you may have better luck when Ubuntu officially rolls out 295.49.  Alternatively, the Launchpad bug has a link to a deb for 295.49.\n", "Q: Allowing restricted useres wifi access Is there a way to allow restricted users/accounts the ability to add a wifi profile and connect to a wifi network?\n\nA: There is an option in the wireless configuration (of each network) that says \"Available to all users\".

You should now be able to login to Webmin at the URL https://localhost:10000/. Or if accessing it remotely, replace localhost with your system's IP address. [Make sure u prefix https and not http]\nIf Debian complains about missing dependencies, you can install them with the command :\nsudo apt-get install perl libnet-ssleay-perl openssl libauthen-pam-perl libpam-runtime libio-pty-perl apt-show-versions python\n\nIf you are installing on Ubuntu and the apt-get command reports that some of the packages cannot be found, edit /etc/apt/sources.list and make sure the lines ending with universe are not commented out.\n\nA: You could try \"Bootup-Manager\", package name 'bum'. It's similar to the Services Manager for Windows. You can start and stop both MySQL and Apache from there. Click 'Advanced' and go to the services tab.\nIf I were you, I would create short and simple scripts to start and stop the services instead, then just add launchers for the scripts to your application launcher.\n\nA: This is more of a remote control panel but it might work for your needs.

I have customised my firefox launcher icon to give me access to profiles by right click. \nHowever what I really want is to hit a key and type \"face\", hit enter and have the Facebook profile launched. Before Unity I had this by having multiple application launchers and then using gnome do to access them.\nSo how can I set up the same workflow with Unity? Is there a keyboard centric way to access the right click menu of launcher icons? Do I have to set up multiple launcher icons?\n\nA: I eventually worked out a way to get what I want using .desktop files in ~/.local/share/applications that allows me to launch specific profiles from the dash.\nThe process for the facebook launcher is to copy the original firefox launcher into the above directory. Then edit two lines to give it a friendly name that the dash will match against, and a command that will launch firefox with the profile I want.\nTo copy the file:\nmkdir -p ~/.local/share/applications/\ncp /usr/share/applications/firefox.desktop ~/.local/share/applications/facefox.desktop\n\nThen you need to edit two lines of the new file - Name= and Exec=. The Name line is near the top, and the Exec line is after lots of translations. Note that there is more than one Exec= line in the file, you want to edit the first one you find.\nI edited them to be:\n...\nName=Facebook Firefox Web Browser\n...\nExec=firefox -P facebook -no-remote %u\n...\n\nJust to explain the Exec line, this is what you can type at a terminal to launch firefox, with:\n\n\n*\n\n*%u being arguments that might be added by the desktop environment,\n\n*the -no-remote flag being required to allow more than one instance of firefox to run, and\n\n*-P facebook selects the profile to use.\n\n\nA: Installing the \"Profile Switcher\" addon on firefox will do what you want.

Please help.\n\nA: Sometimes internet routers have problems passing through NTP traffic. The reason is that UDP is a bit more trickier to forward than TCP and sometimes the port is even used on the device itself for an NTP daemon.\nIn my case it was DD-WRT which blocked all of my NTP traffic. And as you might have noticed: NTP is not very good in saying that something went wrong. And especially not good in saying what went wrong. Here is the link to a thread about DD-WRT:  https://superuser.com/questions/386240/allow-lan-clients-to-sync-time-through-dd-wrt\nYou can easily check if your Router is blocking NTP with the tool ntpdate (which is kind of a single use version of ntpd):\n\n\n*\n\n*ntpdate pool.ntp.org - this call behaves like ntpd as long you run it as root and ntpd is not running at the same time. This command fails if your router blocks NTP\n\n*ntpdate -u pool.ntp.org - this call uses an unprivileged port, which much more likely works.\n\n\nIn case your router blocks NTP, what can you do?\nUnfortunately, ntpd doesn't support any other way of communication than opening the port 123.\nFortunately, there are alternative implementations which use different ports:\n\n\n*\n\n*OpenNTPD\n\n*Chrony\n\n\nI got good results with OpenNTPD, but in Forums people also recommended chrony\nYou can also setup just one OpenNTPD host and let all other machines in your network sync to this machine with their default NTP implementation.\n\nA: You only seem to have one server in your /etc/ntp.conf file. I have:\nserver ntp.ubuntu.com\nserver 0.north-america.pool.ntp.org\nserver 1.north-america.pool.ntp.org\nserver 2.north-america.pool.ntp.org\nserver 3.north-america.pool.ntp.org\n\nIt would probably be a good idea to add at least a couple more.\nHowever, I can reach europium.canonical.com (the first one), therefore I suspect that the problem is communication between remote sites and the ntp port (123). Firewalls can affect this, as can NAT translation.\nPlease check any firewall you might run, and consider setting up your nat (assuming you are running nat) to forward packets directed to port 123 to your server.\n", "Q: copy ssh private keys to another computer I need to use another computer to access my ssh server. This is because a recently implemented vpn at my university doesn't work on my current computer and I have lost access to the server. \nI ssh via encrypted ssh keys. Can I copy these keys to the new computer (on which the vpn works). I tried copying the id_rsa and id_rsa.pub files in the ~/.ssh folder but it doesn't recognize the keys and there is no prompt to input a password to decrypt the keys. \nEDIT: I can't access the server to generate a new key pair for the new computer and am out of the country so can't physically access it. \nThanks.  \n\nA: Encrypted private keys hold their corresponding public key unencrypted. This is how the SSH client can connect to the remote server without asking you the password (it only offers the public part at that point). Whenever the server accepts the public key, the client on your PC wants to decrypt the private key and will ask you for the passphrase.\nNow, whenever the server only accepts connection from a specific IP address, this is declined already in the first step and explains the message you got from the server \"Roaming not allowed by server\".\nSo, my best guess is that your server is restricted in some way to allow only specific IP addresses for this key. You can do this in several ways, but this is a common one in ~/.ssh/authorized_keys:\nfrom=\"192.168.1.2\" ssh-rsa AAAAB3NzaC[...]\n\nTo prove that you can read the public key out of an encrypted private key without password, run:\nssh-keygen -y -f /path/to/private/key\n\n\nA: Check the permissions and ownership of your private key file. From the manual,\n\nThese files contain sensitive data and should be readable by the user but not accessible by others (read/write/execute). ssh will simply ignore a private key file if it is accessible by others.\n\nTypically the key files should look like this,\n$ ls -l ~/.ssh/id_rsa*\n-rw------- 1 benj benj 1766 Jun 22  2011 .ssh/id_rsa\n-rw-r--r-- 1 benj benj  388 Jun 22  2011 .ssh/id_rsa.pub\n\nwhich you can enforce via:\n$ chown benj:benj ~/.ssh/id_rsa*\n$ chmod 600 ~/.ssh/id_rsa\n$ chmod 644 ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub\n\n\nA: Try running ssh-add before you SSH into the server - you should then be prompted for the password and then subsequent ssh connects can use your private key.\nThe ssh-add command adds the keys to the key agent.\n", "Q: Juju stuck in \"pending\" state when using LXC So I'm trying to get started with Juju, and tried to do this locally using LXC.\nI followed the instructions here: How do I configure juju for local usage?\nUnfortunately this doesn't seem to work for me.\nstatus shows the following:\n$ juju status\nmachines:\n  0:\n    agent-state: running\n    dns-name: localhost\n    instance-id: local\n    instance-state: running\nservices:\n  mysql:\n    charm: cs:precise/mysql-1\n    relations:\n      db:\n      - wordpress\n    units:\n      mysql/0:\n        agent-state: pending\n        machine: 0\n        public-address: null\n  wordpress:\n    charm: cs:precise/wordpress-0\n    exposed: true\n    relations:\n      db:\n      - mysql\n    units:\n      wordpress/0:\n        agent-state: pending\n        machine: 0\n        open-ports: []\n        public-address: null\n2012-05-10 14:09:38,155 INFO 'status' command finished successfully\n\nAs you can see the agent-state is 'pending' and there is no public address where I'm able to access the newly created site.

Neither of these programs will render bold font. Instead, the font appears as \"Regular\". How can I fix this?\nThe image below shows an example of Kate rendering python with the stock python highlighting (the colors are inverted using CompizConfig Settings Manager's Negative option). The following words should have appeared bold:\n\n\n*\n\n*class\n\n*def\n\n*__init__\n\n*lambda\n\n*+\n\n*print\n\n\n\nSimilarly Yakuake (or perhaps, the underlying Konsole) is not rendering bold. My LS_COLORS includes: di=01;34 (bold blue)\n\nBelow is my gnome-terminal rendering bold fonts just fine.\n\n\nA: It's been a while since you asked but I had the same problem and got to the bottom of it.\nShort version\n$ sudo rm /etc/fonts/conf.d/60-droid-sans-mono-fonts.conf (this is just a symlink so no actual configuration files are lost).\nLong version\nThe package ttf-droid got replaced by fonts-droid. With that the symlink 60-ttf-droid-sans-mono-fonts.conf in the folder /etc/fonts/conf.d/ got renamed to 60-droid-sans-mono-fonts.conf. That means that the configuration in that file is now read before all configuration in 60-latin.conf and thus overriding it. The font alias Monospace (which is used by default in Yakuake and Kate) is defined as alias to DejaVu Sans Mono in 60-latin.conf, but Droid Sans Mono in 60-droid-sans-mono-fonts.conf. Incidentally, that font does not have a bold version, at least not the files in the fonts-droid package. So everywhere where Yakuake and Kate are supposed to render bold letters the rendering falls back to the regular version of the font.\nIf you do not want to change the setting system wide you could instead add your own alias to Monospace in ~/.fonts.conf. This should work:\n<?xml version=\"1.0\"?>\n<!DOCTYPE fontconfig SYSTEM \"fonts.dtd\">\n<fontconfig>\n  <alias>\n    <family>monospace</family>\n    <prefer>\n      <family>DejaVu Sans Mono</family>\n    </prefer>\n  </alias>\n</fontconfig>\n\nYou can take a look at all the files in /etc/fonts/conf.avail and the fonts.conf manpage to see what else you can put into your .fonts.conf.\n", "Q: Failing gnome-shell theme: where can I find errors/configuration apart from gnome-tweak-tool?

Have you looked at System Monitor to see what is taking up so much CPU?\n\nA: Found it --- it is the proprietary ATI drivers.

Because of it you're seeing some Youtube videos with blue tint.\nFor more information and a fix see this question: Flash video appears blue\n\nA: This is easily achieved using the themes in ambiance-colors.

Pair base_color and text_color are used for the document or text entry portions of windows where bg_color and fg_color are are used for the windows area where icons and labels are displayed. Selected pair is for selected text and the tooltip pair is used for the tips that pop up when you hover over a button or link. These colors may be applied by applications with varying opacity or shadings. The color of text in buttons comes from the fg_color.

But you'll probably run into problems because the base MIBs aren't installed.\nYou'll probably want to change the hostname (it will default to \"localhost\") that appears about 2/3 down the screen.\nYou didn't mention which Ubuntu version you're using, but they don't appear to ship in any package in 12.04. In 10.04, the base MIBs are part of the libsnmp-base package. If you're running a version that doesn't provide the base MIBs as part of libsnmp-base, I'd suggest manually downloading the MIBs and putting them in one of these directories:\n\n\n*\n\n*$HOME/.snmp/mibs\n\n*/usr/share/mibs/site\n\n*/usr/share/snmp/mibs\n\n*/usr/share/mibs/iana\n\n*/usr/share/mibs/ietf\n\n*/usr/share/mibs/netsnmp\n\n\nsince those directories are (apparently) used as the search path by tkmib (and other software).\n\nA: The tkmib package appears to have been 'broken' for some time now. \nTake a look at the very old bug No values from OIDs with tkmib on the Debian mailing list from 2010. The default net-snmp version that shipped with Ubuntu has been 5.4.3 and does work as expected with other SNMP-dependant applications (e.g. Cacti) but not with tkmib.\nI recently compiled a new version of net-snmp (version 5.7.2) following these instructions and was able to get some minimal use out of tkmib.\nAfter compilation, I was able to get some values returned by tkmib. However the application interface does not act as one might expect. That is, when issuing a get query on a MIB instance(say querying the sysDesc MIB, for example), tkmib returns a value of NOSUCHINSTANCE. However, while issuing a getnext query upon the same instance returns the actual expected value.\nI highly recommend using another MIB browser, such as snmpb. The functionality and interface of SnmpB are far superior for obtaining accurate SNMP values, in my opinion, compared to tkmib.\n\nThe MIB browsing, polling, as well as setting MIBS is far less painful than using tkmib\nIf you are set on using tkmib, keep in mind that you will also need to manually create a ~/.snmp directory to save any of your changed values between sessions.\nIf you are interested in taking snmpb for a spin, you can download the .deb file here, and install it with sudo dpkg -i snmpb_0.8_i386.deb\nBest of luck.\n", "Q: How can I modify my partitions so I can install Ubuntu and not damage my Windows installation?

(And I do not want to break the machine again.)\nThis is how my disk is partitioned.\n\n\n*\n\n*270GB Unallocated\n\n*100MB System\n\n*200GB C:/ (Windows 7)\n\n*20MB (I don't remember)\n\n\nI want to merge the number 1 with number 3 and then start installing Ubuntu. When I try to install Ubuntu with that partition it will not let me install. The install is not allowed because there are more than 3 primary partitions or something like that. The system will not allow me to create another primary partition.\nAny suggestions? I just want to merge the partition C:/ disk with the partition I made so I can install Ubuntu in a new partition created at the moment.\nI searched in forums and blogs and they all said that once I delete a partition Windows is able to \"expand\" the C:/ disk. But in my case, I can't do that. I assume that I can't because I created that partition BEFORE I installed Windows 7 again.\nI would appreciate any suggestions. If I could I would delete Windows but I depend on it for my work.\n\nA: Windows cant see your Ubuntu partition as windows cant read the file format ext4, which is normally used for Ubuntu 12.04..\nTwo ways to tackle the problem:\nFirstly just reinstall Ubuntu 12.04. During the installation process both partitions will be shown and you can decide to reinstall Ubuntu on the ext4 partition.\nSecondly you can recover the grub boot manager. This will allow you to access both operating systems without reinstalling them.\nHow to recover grub after window install \nHave fun\n\nA: The thing is that you have to install Windows first because it wont run if it's not first on the disk. I should just use a live cd and make the whole disk a NTFS partition Install Windows on it and then install Ubuntu (Without deleting Windows). Or just stick with Ubuntu and install the Windows programs you need with wine and playonlinux.\n\nA: I suspect your problem is that you have a mixture of both primary and logical partitions on your drive. Yes, Windows 7 can extend a simple volume (partition) if free space is available. However, if the free space is in a logical partition it cannot be used to extend a primary partition.\nBefore you do anything else you should make a backup in case you do lose your data again. you want to be particularly careful if you do not have either\n\n\n*\n\n*a Windows install disk or \n\n*other recovery media from HP which will allow you to restore your\nlaptop to the condition it was in when you received it. \n\n\nMany computers today store the recovery media in a \"special\" partition on the hard drive itself. If that is how your laptop works then you want to be especially careful so you do not delete or damage the recovery partition.\nAccording to the manual on HP's web site you can determine if your laptop has recovery media on the drive by doing the following.\n\n\n*\n\n*Turn on or restart the computer, and then press esc while the “Press\nthe ESC key for Startup Menu” message is displayed at the bottom of\nthe screen. Then, press F11 while the “F11 (System Recovery)” message\nis displayed on the screen.\n\n\nSpeaking for myself, I would not feel comfortable giving you any advice on how to modify your partitions until you provide a more detailed explanation of how your disk is currently partitioned. Providing a list of partitions and their sizes does not tell us enough about how the partitions are actually defined on your disk.\nOne way to provide this information is to create a Bootinfo Summary using a tool named the Boot-Repair. You can install and use this tool after booting your Ubuntu Live CD. Here are instructions for doing this.\nFirst, boot your laptop using the Live CD and select the option to Try Ubuntu.\nOnce the Ubuntu desktop is ready, open a terminal window so you can install and run the Boot-Repair tool and use it to Create a Bootinfo summary. Enter the commands below into the terminal to install the tool using apt-get.\nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:yannubuntu/boot-repair\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get install -y boot-repair\n\n\n\n*\n\n*After the installation completes, run the command boot-repair in the terminal window to start the tool. \n\n*After a slight delay, boot-repair will prompt you to download the newest version. Since you just installed the latest version, answer No.\n\n*If boot-repair asks to install the pastebinit package, respond with Yes.\n\n*The tool will now scan your system and (eventually) display the window shown in the image below. Click on the Create a Bootinfo summary box/button. This will collect information about your hard drive's partitions, but will not make any changes.\n\n\n  \n\n*When the bootinfo summary has been created, boot-repair will display a message containing a URL which should look like this: http://paste.ubuntu.com/123456/.\nREMEMBER THIS URL!\n\nPlease update/edit your question and add this URL. The information in the pastebin this link points to will help us understand how your computer is partitioned so we can suggest changes.\n\n\nA: Thanks you all for your answers but I fix my problem doing the following.\nI was unable to merge disk C:/ with the unallocated area. I think the problem was that the System \"partition\" or space (the one with 100MB) was in between of the unallocated area and the C:/ disk. So, I merge the unallocated are with the System partition. Once I got that I proceed to shrink the System partition and there was the free space I needed to expand the C:/ disk. I run ubuntu from USB, make the partition again with \"install alongside windows 7\" and that was all.\nAgain, thanks a lot for your answers and even maybe there was an easy way to do that, well, I needed to fix my computer and this answer really help me.\nPS: Yeah, I shouldn't be answering my own question but I though that maybe this can help someone with the same problem.\n", "Q: Mouse is freezing in Ubuntu/Xubuntu/Lubuntu I'm using Ubuntu for a while now but since 11.10 I noticed some strange behavior.

I think this only applies if you're using a touchpad, but Ubuntu has a feature which is supposed to disable your mouse while you type. It caused some issues for me in the past.

Or is there a better solution?\n\nA: I wanted to be careful of doing anything damaging to my computer so I got a new hard drive and used a bootable USB drive as my host system and built LFS on the blank hard drive as this would be the safest option.  \nHowever, the LFS team goes pretty far to ensure neither the host nor the build can damage the other.  Chapter 4 sets the stage to ensure this, just follow the directions carefully and you'll be safe.  When you get to Chapter 5, you do very little in the host system everything is done as user lfs which should protect your current system.   \nSource: I just did an LFS build myself!\n", "Q: ubuntu 12.04 is not showing on system start up? i already installed windows first and then installed linux mint12.

What is this command?\n\nA: gpg --list-keys --list-options show-uid-validity\nThis will show a validity calculation next to each address (unknown, undef, marginal, full, ultimate). You can then grep -v the unknown and undef ones, this leaves the ones you (or your web of trust) have some trust for.\ngpg --list-keys --list-options show-uid-validity | grep -v \"unknown\\|undef\"\nFor list-sigs the listing is slightly different, so this may work instead:\ngpg --list-sigs |grep -v \"User ID not found\" |grep -v \"sig  \"\nnote two spaces on the last \"sig  \".\nThis will weed out the unknown user IDs and omit any signatures that don't have a trust level.

I know I can get them working with an ~/.XCompose and switching the input method to xim.  However, Sublime Text 2 doesn't accept any compose key sequences when I'm using xim.  It does accept them when I'm using the default input method.  I think I reported this bug for Sublime Text 2 a while ago.\nUsing the default input method, I added the contents of my ~/.XCompose to /usr/share/X11/locale/en_US.UTF-8/Compose but this did not change anything.

Now when you got your one problem solved, the other has a quick way around. First, to reinstal the MBR, you can use any windows cd/USB and just start repairing the windows(Windows Repair mode, they call it windows RE mode). Now when you got there, open the command prompt at windows RE mode. I am sure you can open up the command prompt,if not then google for it.Now at the command prompt, start typing as illustrated:\nx:\\sources>bootrec /fixmbr\nx:\\sources>bootrec /fixboot //Well only \"/fixmbr\" can do the whole thing for you, this was for the worst case\n\nNow this is how you can boot directly into windows.

An added bonus is that, like Optimus, Bumblebee turns off your nVidia card when you're not using it, so you'll get a better battery life than you would without Bumblebee.\n1 Whatever you do, do not install the proprietary nVidia drivers from nvidia.com! This may totally mess up Ubuntu!\n\nA: Try This :\n\n\n*\n\n*Find out the graphic cards you have: lspci | grep VGA\n\n*Install updated Intel driver: https://launchpad.net/~ubuntu-x-swat/+archive/x-updates\n\n*If discreet card is AMD/ATI:\nhttp://support.amd.com/us/gpudownload/linux/Pages/radeon_linux.aspx\nhttp://wiki.cchtml.com/index.php/Ubuntu_Precise_Installation_Guide\nLet us know if it works :)\n\nA: Peter's link will come in handy for you. First you'll need to purge any drivers that you already installed, and his link will walk you through that. When I first installed Bumblebee on my Dell with Optimus it used the NVIDIA card with optirun but the Intel card ran without hardware-acceleration. If you have this issue refer to this question. Particularly the part talking about /var/log/Xorg.0.log should come in handy. Take a look at your log file and make sure the GLX library is being loaded properly. For me it was trying to load the NVIDIA GLX library for both cards, and the Intel card needs its own GLX library. The Intel library and drivers should already be installed. The only driver you need to install is the NVIDIA one, and the Bumblebee installation will install this for you. All you should need to do is make sure they're being loaded properly.\n\nA: I looked up your laptop's features and it seems your graphics card is an NVIDIA GT 540M.\nYou can choose between two ways:\n\n\n*\n\n*Follow these instructions, which will add a repository to your setup which will let you install the correct driver and afterwards update it automatically:\n\n\n*\n\n*How To Install New Nvidia Linux Driver Supports Ubuntu 11.04 Series 270.41.06?\n\n\n*For your card you would need to download this driver:\n\n\n*\n\n*http://www.nvidia.com/object/linux-display-amd64-295.49-driver.html\nThis download will give you a file with the extension: .run\nJust execute this file as root or sudo from the command line before starting any window manager (or log out from your current session). You may have to shut down lightGDM (the login greeter) as well.\nBoth ways should setup your xorg.conf file to use the new driver.\nAfter installing the driver, you should restart your machine.\n", "Q: Proxy exceptions in 12.04 LTS How do I setup proxy exceptions under Ubuntu 12.04?\nAlready tried the proposed solutions for earlier Ubuntu versions and none seem to work. There is no Network Proxy Preferences in 12.04 AFAIK.\nSystem Settings -> Network -> Network Proxy does not offer the possibility to add exceptions.\nIs there a file where these settings reside so I can edit them manually and add exceptions (and so the settings are honored by all network apps)?\nI would really appreciate any info on this one not already mentioned on earlier answers, as none of theme worked for me. Thanks!\n\nA: I had the same issue with 12.04 and the solution given on this thread worked for me.\n\nA: Thanks nvk, this finally worked for me too, but there is a catch:\nIn dconf-editor there is a help text that reads something like 'if no configuration for https is given, the proxy server configured for http will be used for https too'. This is not true, at least for Ubuntu 12.04. I had to add the server for all protocols, even being the same one for http, ftp and https. After I did this, and after a logging off and in again, proxies (including exceptions) took effect for all applications.\nStill, I think the 'normal' network settings GUI could be made better by the addition of an extra input box for the proxy exceptions in the proxies settings part. I hope to see this in a future Ubuntu update.\n\nA: You use either gconf-editor /system/http_proxy/ignore_hosts\nor dconf-editor (and manually navigate to system -> http_proxy -> ignore_hosts).\nContrary to what others wrote, there is no need to re-login for changes to take effect.\nMoreover, settings done for /system/http_proxy/ignore_hosts also take effect for https.\n", "Q: How to enable 'Tab'bing in Unity Dash (12.04) I have done a clean install from Ubuntu 11.10 to 12.04.

The general purpose of dnsmasq is known to be a DNS relay and DHCP server. The running process is reported as follows:\n\n/usr/sbin/dnsmasq --no-resolv --keep-in-foreground --no-hosts --bind-interfaces --pid-file=/var/run/sendsigs.omit.d/network-manager.dnsmasq.pid --listen-address=127.0.0.1 --conf-file=/var/run/nm-dns-dnsmasq.conf --cache-size=0 --proxy-dnssec\n\nLooks like it is spawned by network-manager. Contents of mentioned files are:\n\n#cat /var/run/nm-dns-dnsmasq.conf\n  server=192.168.2.1\n\nIn my local network 192.168.2.1 indeed is a DNS server.\nI cannot understand why this instance of dnsmasq listens on 127.0.0.1 since I see no way to serve DNS relay and DHCP server on 127.0.0.1 interface.\n\nA: 127.0.0.1 is the loopback address, it is not accessible by other machines, just the machine itself. According to the post http://www.stgraber.org/2012/02/24/dns-in-ubuntu-12-04/, this dnsmasq instance exists to improve performance by trying multiple DNS servers if one is too slow.\n\nA: It is a DNS server and it'd assign IP addresses to machines that request them from your computer. In this case it'd be used by NetworkManager to share your internet connection. Nothing to worry about :)\n", "Q: Could rsyslog be purging log files?

And what do you think? The logs are coming in again, actually showing me someone is trying to brute-force SSH users. So I turned off password login for sshd.\nSo, my question is: Does rsyslog sometimes hang, and stop logging?\nCould this be a logrotate issue? The syslog.1 files and similar have log data.\n\nA: That's due to what logrotate does. It's kinda like a log files janitor, moves them, compresses and caches. You can also consider changing SSH server's port, I run mine on 44 instead of 22 and that keeps people from doing stupid scans :)\n", "Q: Using Ubuntu Cloud as cloud storage for all Ubuntu installations Is it possible to use the Ubuntu Server Cloud as a storage solution for all of my Ubuntu installations.

I could use Dropbox or something to synchronize them, but that only works on computers I use Empathy on. I would still lose out on chat logs that I make from within Gmail or Google Plus or on my phone or anywhere else.\nAn ideal solution for me, as someone who only chats through my Google account, would be if Empathy would just use Google's chat log, the same one I access through Gmail. This would be used to display previous conversations when a chat window is opened, and to view chat logs in Empathy's UI.\nIs this possible? I tried Googling but I couldn't even find anyone asking this question.\n\nA: I have the same problem. As far as I can tell, syncing the logs with the Google account was the default behaviour until the last update. Perhaps you can make it work simply by rolling back to a previous version.\n", "Q: How to change the time for OS selection menu in GRUB?

The parameters for the mouse are acceleration and threshold. The acceleration can be specified as an integer, or as a simple fraction. The mouse, or whatever pointer the machine is connected to, will go acceleration times as fast when it travels more than threshold pixels in a short time. This way, the mouse can be used for precise alignment when it is moved slowly, yet it can be set to travel across the screen in a flick of the wrist when desired. One or both parameters for the m option can be omitted, but if only one is given, it will be interpreted as the acceleration. If no parameters or the flag 'default' is used, the system defaults will be set.\nIf the threshold parameter is provided and 0, the acceleration parameter will be used in the exponent of a more natural and continuous formula, giving precise control for slow motion but big reach for fast motion, and a progressive transition for motions in between. Recommended acceleration value in this case is 3/2 to 2, but not limited to that range.\nacceleration defines how many times faster the cursor will move than the default speed. threshold is the velocity required for acceleration to become effective, usually measured in device units per 10ms. acceleration can be a fraction, so if you want to slow down the mouse you can use 1/2, 1/3, 1/4, ... if you want to make it faster you can use 2/1, 3/1, 4/1, ...\nFor more info check out  https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Mouse_acceleration\n\nA: In case s. o. has trouble with the mouse being too fast, check out this solution that implies that the graphical setting is uninitialized:\nhttps://ubuntu-mate.community/t/mouse-too-fast-in-18-04-again-known-methods-stopped-working/18805\n\nA: in terminal type\nvi mouse.sh\n\nthen paste your config in \nxinput --set-prop 12 \"Device Accel Constant Deceleration\" 5\n\nquit and save \nthen do \nchmod +x mouse.sh \n\nthen in gnome-session-properties put the mouse.sh file in. \nthen you're done.\n", "Q: ifort with geany problem I've changed my build/compile commands on geany to use Intel's Fortran:\n    ifort -c \"%f\"\n    ifort \"%f\" -o \"%e\"\n\nWhen I try compiling, I get the following error:\nifort \"file.f90\" -o \"file\" (in directory: ...)\nCompilation failed.\n/bin/sh: 1: ifort: not found\n\nHowever, I can type \n    ifort -o file file.f90\n\nin terminal and it will compile with no problem.

It provides most of the functionality you've enumerated, with the exception of MIDI editing.\nFor MIDI editing I'd suggest Aria Maestosa, though it's not currently packaged for Ubuntu so you'll probably have to download and build the source.\n\nA: Makes me sad to say, but I've really tried a lot of different options to replace Garageband on Linux. I just have not found any good options thus far.  \nWhy is Garageband good for me, a musician who plays instruments, and likes to create his own melodies, rhythm, percussion, strings, and other tracks?\nIt's dead simple to get started.  I plug in my 88 Key USB Midi keyboard (detected automagically), create a new project, add a track, pick a sound (instrument) from a pre-installed list included with Garageband, and start playing / recording.  Need another Track, add a track, pick a sound, start playing / recording.  Need to switch back, just click the track and done.  \nThus far on Linux my experience has not been so smooth.  I tried LMMS (which is okay, but getting sounds is not simple or straight-forward.  Recording, still haven't figured out how to record a track.  Want to hear the sound on track 2, oh wait, you have to go tell the midi connection that you no longer want track 1, and now want track 2.  Rosegarden...nice, but first I had to spend weeks trying to understand JackCTL, then find a synth to connect it to, then figure out why my midi keyboard wasn't detected, then once I could play a sound, forget about switching tracks...OMG!   \nAnd thus far, pretty much everything I've tried has had some level of similar complication.  Ardour, QTractor, Reaper, Waveform Free from Tracktion, and on, and on.  \nI love open source software, but it has got to be easier for the average bear.  I just want to connect up, sit down, and start playing / recording.  I just want to switch tracks, and the system knows...ohhhh you want to record strings now...not brass...ok.

To fix it, run on the command-line:\nsudo apt install python3-pip\npip3 install --ignore-installed --user grpcio==1.44.0\n\nPip installs modules to ~/.local/share/lib/python*, so you can delete that directory if you want to undo the previous command.\n\nA: Something like this might be good to you. Firestarter looks a powerful firewall program. Might be worth giving a shot.  \nBut I would advise just using IPtables. As stated above it can be configured with ufw for ease of use.\nUbuntu has a great documentation for its IPtables implementation. With this you dont really need an app. If you are comfortable with the cmd line then you wil be able to set up your firewall to drop everything leaving your PC. Without yourself adding a rule to allow it. eg. for example port 80 for webserver.\nOnce you have used IPtables you will wonder how you worked without it!\nEDIT: Might find that its not so easy to get a sort of idiot proof firewall like that on Linux. And that's no way a dig at you I use it on my MacBook Pro ha! ( OSX is great imo ) Just the applications available on linux usually involve a bit more configuration.  \nBill\n\nA: Here is a guide on how to install comodo. I dont know if the program is as good as little snich. Hope that program is what you were looking for!\n\nA: InJoy firewall is by far the best option if you can afford it.

I can drag stuff off the screen and put it on the 'space' of the second monitor and even a screen-shot shows that there are two monitors active; but the monitor is OFF. It will not power on. It goes into 'power-save' mode because it is not receiving a signal.\nFor some reason it is not getting the signal to power on, even though Ubuntu thinks the monitor is working properly.\nI had this working fine on my Sony VAIO yesterday (with Radeon graphics/default Ubuntu video drivers).

I was advised that \"ld_preload\" can be set so that I can permit firefox traffic over port 80 but prevent Dash from connecting to port 80.\nCan someone explain how I can accomplish this with ld_preload?\n\nA: Perhaps a better option is to use ufw to disable outbound traffic, and only enable it for specific ports.  That is not application specific.\nI think to really get application specific, you need to start messing around with AppArmor.

Unity functioned than in 3D. The only think I did is select the additional driver as Ubuntu pointed out in additional drivers, reboot and it functioned. I think your card is quit similar. So look if Ubuntu shows fglrx with additional drivers.\nI've some warnings for you:\n1. with the fglrx-driver the system is not always stable (at least with my card). When switching you 'll see shortly all kinds of strange graphics and some times the system hangs. Some applications did not function right with this driver. Like the xscreensaver (it does not show a unlock box) or it hangs sometimes when shutting down the system.\n2. The radeon driver is sometimes instable when it boots early (look on the internet with keywords: flash or flicker and \"radeon.modeset=0\"). It is common that most os drivers boot early when the kernel loads. On my system the radeon driver makes it slow and all the time I have flashes with the driver early loaded. To make the driver start late and function right you will have to add the option: radeon.modeset=0 in grub, you can add this command in the file:\n/etc/default/grub just behind \"quiet splash\" the line will be:\nGRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT=\"quiet splash radeon.modeset=0\"\n3. AMD did drop the support for our graphics cards. So from Ubuntu 12.10 and later it is not supported.\nI switched back to the radeon driver and use unity-2D (so what? it works). Some 3D functionality functions tough (I think/heard) only not with opengl/Unity. I read on internet tough that it is possible to get it working in 3D (and fast and stable) when you install Ubuntu 12.10 and ad a 3.6 kernel (not standard). See:\nhttp://www.ubuntuvibes.com/2012/10/how-to-enable-opengl-30-support-for.html\nI like the Long time support of Ubuntu 12.4 and will stick with Unity-2D (games functions, my video's run fast enough, etc.).\nGood luck.\n\nA: Some users reported for the Radeon HD4xxx series to have also installed (apart from the Proprietary drivers) the xserver-xorg-video-ati package.

My laptop is a Windows 7 / Ubuntu 12.04 LTS dual-boot setup. I've been experimenting with alternative desktop shells on my Windows partition, such as KDE and Cairo.\nAfter setting Cairo as my default shell, I decided to restart my computer and log back into Windows just to make sure everything was working properly. However, after logging in, I found myself left with nothing but the mouse cursor and a blank desktop filled with the default background color.\nI know the registry setting I need to change in order to restore Windows Explorer as the default shell from my prior experimentation with KDE, but I obviously can't use regedit if I can't load into a working desktop. However, I can still use my Ubuntu partition with no problems.\nThis has me wondering if there is a way I can mount my Windows partition in Ubuntu and somehow edit the registry from there. How would I go about doing this, and do I need any extra packages for it?\n\nA: I believe that's what you're looking for, \"Offline NT Password & Registry Editor\"(chntpw)\nWhat is chntpw?\nchntpw is a software utility for resetting or blanking local passwords used by Windows NT, 2000, XP, Vista, 7, and 8.1. It also contains a simple registry editor and hex-editor with which the information contained in a registry file can be browsed and modified under linux/unix.\nHow to install?\nYou can install it from terminal by running this command:\nsudo apt-get install chntpw\nOr search for \"chntpw\" in Software Center.\nAdditional sources:\nUsing chntpw in Ubuntu to Hack the Windows Registry\nChange or Reset Windows Password from a Ubuntu Live CD\n", "Q: Curly brackets don't work on a Toshiba Satellite A500D-111 When I installed Ubuntu 12.04, curly brackets no longer worked.

So you might want to check the command lsusb (in terminal) to confirm that it is detected correctly.\n(My lsusb output with keyboard marked in yellow)\n\nYou might want to take a look into your system settings keyboard tab.\n\nIn the typing tab on the bottom there shoud be a link to get you in the layout setting.\n\nHere you can play around with some of the options and see if it helps.\nIf you click on your keyboard layout in the list (Probably labeled English in my case it is German) and the keyboard symbol on the bottom of the list (5th symbol)\n\nyou can see your current keyboard layout visually to see if everything looks fine there.\n\nYou can press keys in this view and see If they are recognised. This is important to check if your alt-gr key is correctly mapped to the alt-fn combination you probably use\nCould you please post more Information about the laptop (brand, model).\n\nA: Go to Options menu in Keyboard layout settings. Then choose \"Key(s) to change layout\", and check the \"Right alt\" alternative.\n", "Q: How can I make my Ubuntu 12.04 auto-shutdown when battery is fully charged? I would love if someone could give me a script or something like that to make it do what I describe in the title...\n\nA: Here is a small python program which uses terminal to look into file for battery status and handles the operation with defined function. This will work for general case, but though, there might be a little problem. It uses the package \"acpi\" which monitors the battery status. The program is:\nimport commands\nimport pynotify\nfrom threading import Timer\n\n\ndef battery_check():\n\n    rem = float(commands.getoutput(\"grep \\\"^remaining capacity\\\" /proc/acpi/battery/BAT0/state | awk '{ print $3 }'\"))\n    full = float(commands.getoutput(\"grep \\\"^last full capacity\\\" /proc/acpi/battery/BAT0/info | awk '{ print $4 }'\"))\n    state = commands.getoutput(\"grep \\\"^charging state\\\" /proc/acpi/battery/BAT0/state | awk '{ print $3 }'\")\n\n    percentage = int((rem/full) * 100)\n\n    if percentage == 100:\n        pynotify.init(\"Battery Full!

I've recently installed Ubuntu 12.04 via wubi, and have so far been unsuccessful in configuring the system to allow a 1366x768 screen resolution.  The platform is an HP Pavilion g6-1d73us with Intel HD Graphics 3000, and in Windows 7 the highest resolution is 1366x768.\nPlease let me know what specific information is needed to diagnose this problem, and I will be happy to report back here.\n\nA: have you tried to \"add\" the resolution?\nI did this with an HP 1740 monitor.\nYou could use a .sh file to add that, lets say for example, you want to add a 1280x1024 resolution:\nfixme.sh:\n#!/bin/sh\nxrandr --newmode 1280x1024_60.00  109.00  1280 1368 1496 1712  1024 1027 1034 1063 -hsync +vsync\nxrandr --addmode VGA1 1280x1024_60.00\nxrandr --output VGA1 --mode 1280x1024_60.00\n\nThen you can execute your file:\nsh fixme.sh\nand there you go, new resolution available\n\nA: What have you tried so far?\nUsually, you just navigate to 'Displays' in 'System Settings' and change the resolution.\n\nIf that does not show you the resolutions you want, you may need to install the appropriate driver for your video card. Again, got to 'System Settings' and open 'Additional Drivers' and see if there's any video driver available:\n\nIf there is any video-related driver available (mine is just an example), activate it and restart. Now 'Displays' screen may show more resolutions.\n", "Q: Why do I have problems seeing YouTube? Recently I moved to Ubuntu, I had Windows.\nIn Windows I could see very comfortable, but now in Ubuntu I can't. \nIn the videos now, the picture and sound are out of sync.\nOften you can't see the videos of the hughe out of sync.\nI have a good computer, Lenovo G550 with 250Gb memory and 4Gb of Ram\n\nA: Did you install the package called ubuntu-restricted-extras? You can do this in the Software Center or, if you prefer the to use the command-line, then by running sudo apt-get update followed by sudo apt-get install ubuntu-restricted-extras.\nIf you have ubuntu-restricted-extras, then verify that a Flash plugin is actually installed by checking for the adobe-flashplugin or flashplugin-installer packages. If neither is installed, install one of them. If you're running the 64-bit version of Ubuntu, installing adobe-flashplugin is preferable. (But don't have them both installed at the same time.)\nIf you're running the 64-bit version of Ubuntu and you find that you have flashplugin-installer installed and the problem continues, then try removing it and replacing it with adobe-flashplugin.\nIf none of the above works, check to see if you're using the HTML5 beta on YouTube! by going to http://youtube.com/html5. Theoretically, and eventually, this should perform uniformly better on Ubuntu. But right now, it might not work well. So if it's turned off, you can try it and see if it works better. If it's turned on, try turning it off and seeing what happens.\nIf you have trouble doing any of the above, please post a comment here. If you do the above but it doesn't work, please edit your question to indicate that it didn't, and also to include the output of this command (which you should run in the Terminal): dpkg -l | egrep 'flash|gnash|swf|spark'\n\nA: Which browser are you using? I  find that using google-chrome provides the best overall Flash experience. \nIf you're using gnash, you'll want to remove that- and install Adobe's own proprietary format.   The installer is usually available via their own website: http://get.adobe.com/flashplayer/\nNote: you can also install flashplugin-installer but all it basically does is perform a wget to the latest version at http://get.adobe.com/flashplayer/ and run the installer\n", "Q: Pipable command to print in color?

Ubuntu One's Security FAQ indicates that Canonical encrypts connections and restricts access to user data. This all well and fine, and I do trust SSL for online banking and other things more valuable than my private keys.\nThat said, I am quite anxious about putting my ~/.ssh/id_dsa up in the cloud. Obviously, no system is totally secure. Could some knowledgeable party, then, pragmatically quantify the risks? \n\nA: Ubuntu One storage is not encrypted with a user cryptographic key\nLike Dropbox, Ubuntu One store is not encrypted with a special passphrase. Therefore, it would be technically possible for someone to get access to your data, either by an untrustworthy employee or by a security breach. See this bug report about UbuntuOne storage data encryption it is still a wishlist.\nSo I would not synced my ~/.ssh folder to the cloud. Unless you set an encrypted container which is then sent over to the cloud, but then for ssh keys, it is not always that handy. But I give you still handy ways of encrypting your data:\n\n\n*\n\n*Safeguarding your storage on Ubuntu One\n\n*Using Cloud storage safely\nMore information\nUbuntu One is using encryption for the connection (as said in the fact), it means that basically the data are transmitted over some sort of HTTPS. You can use a really well done animation of what is visible to eavesdropper when using HTTPS, courtesy of the EFF (Electronic Frontier Foundation).\nBy clicking on the HTTPS button on the EFF animation, you will be able to see what is visible to everybody when you put your SSH keys in a Dropbox or Ubuntu One container. As the animation tells, many persons at site.com (e.g. one.ubuntu.com) would be able to view your data (and many more). Even if you would use something like Tor to route all your traffic, it would still mean that people at site.com can access the data.\nSo you have to encrypt the data before it leaves your computer. So it arrives encrypted at site.com with credentials they don't know about. Of course, you would have to use a strong encryption mechanism so that it would make it extremely slow for the people at site.com to crack it.\nOf course in case of a bank, you can not encrypt your money, as you pay the bank to handle it for you. So you have no choice but to trust the bank to make their IT system as secure as their physical vaults so that only a small subset of employees (the ones managing your account) can view and modify your data.\n\nA: \nI am quite anxious about putting my ~/.ssh/id_dsa up in the cloud.\n\nWell, one solution is what I do with my ssh and gpg private keys with Dropbox: encrypt them into an archive, and delete the \"raw\" originals. Whenever needed, I temporarily extract it and then delete it when done. \nI use p7zip (uses AES-256 encryption), but you could use a number of other tools. That way, all that gets synced is the encrypted archive, and even if the cloud storage is compromised, no one can extract the private keys unless they know the passphrase for the archive.\nTo make life easier for stuff you do frequently (say, gpg decryption), you can have a simple bash script handle the temporary decryption/use/deletion part; it should also disable any sync daemons temporarily so that the extracted keys aren't accidentally synced over.\n\nA: You can save your keys on U1 through the backup tool Deja-dup. If you set a password the backup files are encrypted automatically on U1.\nNo need to do this manually.\n\nA: There are different available metrics for defining risk, but you need to take into account the value of the data or systems which the key could give access to.   If the key is lost, and some entity can use it gain access, what will be compromised?  Is the fear going to be exposure of confidential data, data loss, the possibility of compromising accounts from an administrative or account level, etc.?  If you can recreate data that isn't confidential, and if you have confidential data stored securely (e.g., encrypted), this is less pressing.  I think that enumerating workarounds for different weaknesses in the system is part of defining your over-all risk.\n Pragmatically, it's unlikely that storing your .id_rsa will be a problem, especially if you rotate keys at some interval.  This relies on several assumptions, but nevertheless, I would not store the .ssh data unencrypted if that's a viable option.  \n\nA: Simple solution. Sort of. If you can't use something like a USB flash drive, put a passphrase on your SSH key. Instant two-factor authentication (sort of). You don't even have to upload a new public key.\n", "Q: What's the difference between KDE packages? So I'm going to install KDE in Precise. I found that there wasn't an entry for Plasma Desktop (only KDE apps) in the software center, so I fired up Synaptic to look for the packages.\nHowever, now I'm finding way too many of these.

Is there any difference between them? Which one should I install?\n\nA: I've checked the packages that apt-get install would install for each of these. These aren't complete lists, but only list the differences from my Unity (ie., without any KDE programs) setup.\nplasma-netbook and plasma-desktop differ only by whether they install the netbook or the desktop interface. kde-workspace is identical to plasma-desktop.\nkde-plasma-desktop will install a few KDE programs: Dolphin, Konqueror, kde-baseapps, konsole, kwrite, and kde-passwd.\nkde-standard installs a bunch of stuff on top of kde-desktop: Akregator, Ark, Dragonplayer, gnupg, Kaddressbook, Kate, KDE wallpapers, Kmail, etc.\nkubuntu-desktop installs even more than kde-standard. kubuntu-desktop is the package you would download from the Ubuntu website if you wanted Kubuntu, but if you only want the Plasma interface, not any of the default programs, plasma-desktop might be sufficient.\n", "Q: Is there a simple way to visualize a spreadsheet in terminal or as clear text?

I told Ubuntu to install into partition 2 and  to install GRUB on partition 1 and that works fine. But the problem now is that I can't boot Windows 7. It just returns to the GRUB menu after I select it.\nFrom what I have researched, if I can edit GRUB to boot Windows 7 \"mbr\" or the bootloader \\windows\\system32\\winload.exe (without using a Windows 7 repair disk), my problem will be solved.

However, the report I am asking for contains more detailed information and might give us a better understanding of why you are unable to boot Windows using GRUB.\nHow to use boot-repair to provide a \"Bootinfo Summary\"\n\nSince you can still boot Ubuntu, you can install and run the Boot-Repair tool using the apt-get command and then use it to Create a Bootinfo summary.\nRun the commands below in a terminal window to install the boot-repair tool.\nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:yannubuntu/boot-repair\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get install -y boot-repair\n\n\n\n*\n\n*After that completes, enter the command boot-repair to start the tool. \n\n*After a slight delay, boot-repair will ask if you want to download its newest version.

The information in the pastebin this link points to will (I hope) help us diagnose the problem.\n\n\n\nI think over-writing the Windows partition's VBR caused this problem.\nMy understanding is that there are several steps to starting an operating system. In your case, I think something like the steps below happens.\n\n\n*\n\n*The BIOS on your computer attempts to run the code in the first sector of the hard drive. This first sector is usually referred to as the MBR (Master Boot Record).\n\n*In addition to the MBR, every partition can also have a boot record. It is often referred to as the Volume Boot Record or VBR. The MBR on your hard drive transfers controls to the VBR of partition 1, your Windows partition.\n\n*Windows expect a partition's VBR to take the next step towards booting an operating system such as Windows 7. So Windows would have originally installed a VBR which would transfer control to the Windows bootmgr program in your Windows partition.\nHowever, when you instructed the Ubuntu install a program to install GRUB into the Windows partition, GRUB appears to have replaced the Windows VBR with its own. This GRUB VBR displays the GRUB boot menu.\n\n*The instructions GRUB currently uses to boot Windows are essentially to locate the VBR in the Windows partition and transfer control to it. The VBR in the Windows partition is GRUB's VBR. Transferring control to it just (re)displays the GRUB boot menu.\n\n\nUnfortunately, I am not sure yet what would be the best way to fix this. We want to be careful that we do not break GRUB and make it impossible to boot anything on your computer when we attempt to fix the problem booting Windows.\nBelow is a copy of some of the information from your Bootinfo Summary for reference.

I am not sure this will work, but it seems worth trying. \nCurrently, your grub.cfg uses the GRUB boot commands below to boot Windows 7.\nmenuentry \"Windows 7 (loader) (on /dev/sda1)\" --class windows --class os {\n    insmod part_msdos\n    insmod ntfs\n    set root='(hd0,msdos1)'\n    search --no-floppy --fs-uuid --set=root 1EA0019AA0017A13\n    chainloader +1\n}\n\nI am suggesting you try changing this and use these commands instead.\nmenuentry \"Windows 7 (loader) (on /dev/sda1)\" --class windows --class os {\n    insmod part_msdos\n    insmod ntfs\n    insmod ntldr\n    set root='(hd0,msdos1)'\n    search --no-floppy --fs-uuid --set=root 1EA0019AA0017A13\n    ntldr ($root)/bootmgr\n}\n\nHere are the steps to do this. \n\n\n*\n\n*Boot your system to the GRUB menu.\n\n*Select (highlight) the GRUB boot menu entry Windows 7 (loader) (on\n/dev/sda1).\n\n*Press e to edit the GRUB boot commands for Windows 7.  \n\n*Make two changes to this list of commands as illustrated in the menuentry above.\n\n\n*\n\n*Add the command insmod ntldr\n\n*Change the command\nchainloader +1\nto \nntldr ($root)/bootmgr\n\n\n*Press either Ctrl+X or F10 to boot using\nthese edited commands.\n\n\nNote 1: \nIf the above workaround succeeds in loading the Windows 7 boot menu, then you could make it semi-persistent by \n\n\n*\n\n*Using sudo to edit the file /etc/grub.d/40_custom and add the second, modified menuentry shown above. (If you do this, I'd also suggest you change the title of this \"custom\" entry.)\n\n*Run the command sudo update-grub to update /boot/grub/grub.cfg to include your customized entry. (It will be on the bottom of the GRUB menu when you boot.)\n\n\nI would view the suggestion above as only a partly-baked solution. A better solution is to restore the Windows VBR to the Windows partition without also destroying the ability of GRUB to boot. \nI think ... but am not 100% sure ... that the Windows recovery command bootsect can be used to do this. If you want to risk it, one possible way to do this is outlined below.\n\n\n*\n\n*When booting Windows, press F8 to bring up the Advanced Boot Options menu.\n\n*Select the Repair Your Computer entry.\n\n*Walk through the next windows until you reach System Recovery Options.\n\n*Select Command Prompt\n\n*Run the command bootsect /nt60 C:\nBut you might also want to wait a bit and see what other answers you get to your \nthe question before you take the risk of trying the above.\nNote 2:\nWhile searching for other things, I ran across two other questions on AskUbuntu which are related to your problem.\n\n\n*\n\n*Windows 7 won't boot after installing Ubuntu 11\n\n*Windows 7 doesn't boot after Ubuntu install\nI'm not sure how much help these questions provide. The answer to the second question was to use the command bootrec /fixboot to restore the VBR for the Windows partition. My understanding from that question was that using the bootrec /fixboot command solved the problem.\nBut the second question insists that bootrec /fixboot did not solve the problem.\n(Beats the heck out of me as to what might be going on there.)\n\nA: I don't really know about \"(UN)booting)\"\nyou shoud try to fix your Windows by using Windows Repair disk (choose Command Prompt to run the bootsect.exe utility.

My understanding with NAT is that the system would use a single IPv4 address to connect the virtual machine to the network. \nHow can I change the VM config. so that I can access the 192.168.x.x subnet?\n\nTechnical details of VM/network config.\n\n\n*\n\n*Using NAT adapter from Virtualbox to communicate w/LAN\n\n*Nmap scan of 10.0.2.1-254 returns 5 active hosts on LAN\n\n\nI'm trying to:\n\n\n*\n\n*Use nmap to perform a scan of the 192.168.2.x subnet\n\n\nThe issue:\n\n\n*\n\n*Can only scan LAN if querying 10.0.2.1-254, shouldn't I be querying 192.168.2.1-254? \nCommand used:\nnmap -sP 10.0.2.1-254\n\nWindows 7 x64 (Host)\nWindows IP Configuration\n...\n   Physical Address. . . . . . . . . : EC-55-F9-C8-67-38\n   DHCP Enabled. . . . . . . . . . . : Yes\n   Autoconfiguration Enabled . . . . : Yes\n   Link-local IPv6 Address . . . . . : fe80::f9cc:d2f8:a30d:15b0%12(Preferred)\n   IPv4 Address. . . . . . . . . . . : 192.168.2.4(Preferred)\n   Subnet Mask . . . . . . . . . . . : 255.255.255.0\n   Default Gateway . . . . . . . . . : 192.168.2.1\n   DHCP Server . . . . . . . . . . . : 192.168.2.1\n\nBacktrack 5 VirtualBox VM (Guest)\nroot@bt:~# ifconfig eth0\neth0      Link encap:Ethernet HWaddr 08:00:27:40:ed:f7\n          inet addr:10.0.2.15 Bcast:10.0.2.255 Mask:255.255.255.0\n          inet6 addr: fe80::a00:27ff:fe40:edf7/64 Scope:Link\n          UP BROADCAST RUNNING MULTICAST MTU:1500 Metric:1\n          ...\n\n\nA: Instead of NAT, use bridge adapter.

I had to create the hgfs directory\nsudo mkdir /mnt/hgfs\n\nso that Shared Folders would work, and they did, at least until I rebooted the guest. If I disable the shared folders and re-enable, then they work again, until I reboot the guest.\nHow can I get VMware Shared Folders to persist past a reboot?\n\nA: VMware Player should give you an option to set Shared Folders to Always Enabled instead of Enabled until next power-off or suspend (which is the problem you seem to have). If you don't see such an option, just add this line to the .vmx file for your Virtual Machine:\nisolation.tools.hgfs.disable = \"FALSE\"\nIf that line already exists, set it to \"FALSE\".\n\nThe VMX file contains the configuration for a virtual machine. If you don't know where that is, open terminal, and type sudo updatedb; sudo locate .vmx to get the location of the VMX file you want, and then type gksudo gedit \"path-to-vmx-file.vmx\".\n\nAlternately, instead of open-vm-tools, try the latest official VMware Tools for Linux guests on VMWare player, available here and here.\nNote that VMWare Tools now include an experimental feature to automatically rebuild modules when a new/different kernel is detected:\n\n!!! [EXPERIMENTAL] !!!\nVMware automatic kernel modules enables automatic building and installation of\nVMware kernel modules at boot they are not already present.  By selecting yes,\nyou will be enabling this experimental feature.  You can always disable this\nfeature by re-running vmware-config-tools.pl.\n\nWould you like to enable VMware automatic kernel modules?\n\n", "Q: How do I share files between two computers? Pulling my hair out trying to find out how to share files between a Ubuntu 12.04 laptop and a Lubuntu 11.10 desktop. Forum searches do not yield specific enough suggestions or do not seem to apply to my version (Where is menu > places, in 12.04?). \nI would greatly appreciate some help.\n\nA: There are several ways to share files in Linux, including FTP, SSH, Samba, NFS\nIf you want to share files and keep them in sync in both machines, probably Samba and NFS are the best options. If you only want to transfer a file from one machine to other probable FTP or SSH would be the simplest.\nSee the following docs for setting them up:\nSamba https://help.ubuntu.com/8.04/serverguide/configuring-samba.html\nNFS https://help.ubuntu.com/community/SettingUpNFSHowTo\nFTP (on the server side):\nsudo apt-get install inetutils-ftpd\nSSH (on the server side):\nsudo apt-get install openssh-server\n\nA: I wound up using ssh which is fine.

When I want to choose a colour for the desktop background or for the terminal's profile, for example, the program is like a program for kids. You can't choose the colours according to value, saturation, hue etc. with precision and fast, as with a professional colour chooser, like it was before. So, is there a way to change the kids-like colour chooser for a professional colour-chooser?\n\nA: Not that i know of, its how the GNOME devs wanted to do it. I admit I dont like it either, but I don't even use the GUI to change the colors like that, I use my terminal config settings.\n", "Q: Which file holds the path settings?

How can I change them by directly editing the file ? echo $PATH returns this : /usr/lib/lightdm/lightdm:/usr/local/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/sbin:/usr/bin:/sbin:/bin:/usr/games\n\nA: Global path settings: /etc/environment \nUser specific settings: ~/.bashrc\nThe paths are normally updated by the system when you install packages or change configurations e.g. proxy settings. Anyway, you can also change the paths or other environment variables editing the above files directly.\n", "Q: How can I programmatically change the keyboard layout? I want to run a shell command or script that will configure each of my Ubuntu Precise boxes to use the Dvorak keyboard layout as the default (and only) layout. With earlier versions, I was able to set the XKBVARIANT in /etc/default/keyboard but when I make this change in Precise (and reboot), the keyboard layout appears to be unaffected (both in console and in gnome).\nI tried also setting the XKBMODEL to pc105 and XKBLAYOUT to us, but that did not seem to help.\nI know I can set the layout for gnome using the 'keyboard layout' tool... but I want the change to affect the console, and I want to automate the process. How can I accomplish this?\nEdit:\nTo clarify, I want to know how I can cause to change (using only a script or command-line) the keyboard layout to be Dvorak as the default and only keyboard layout for both Gnome and the console. I want this change to be persistent (survive reboots), just as it is when the change is made through the Keyboard Layout tool.\nEdit:\nLet me put it another way. If I had installed the operating system myself (which I did not because the OS was installed by the virtual machine infrastructure), I could have selected the desired keyboard layout at install time, and that layout would be applied persistently, system-wide. How can I change the layout to appear as if I had set it during the install process?\n\nA: I too use Ubuntu 12.04 and have stuggled with this issue.  Using Jason Coombs' answer to his own question as a starting point, I was able to use /etc/default/keyboard to set my keyboard options (for me, ctrl:nocaps and compose:menu) and have that persist across reboots for consoles. However, the setting would be ignored by LightDM/Unity upon reboot.  To clarify, I have not set any keyboard preferences from within Unity, so Unity should be defaulting to the system default keyboard settings, but it is not using the keyboard options for some reason.\nI noticed that if I run the following command after logging in, Unity suddenly begins to recognize my system default keyboard options:\n\nsetxkbmap\n\nI do not supply any parameters to setxkbmap, I merely invoke it with no options and it reads and applies the system default map.\nTo make this happen automatically when any user logs in (at least, any user with a Gnome or Unity desktop), I have made the following setxkbmap.desktop file that I placed in the /etc/xdg/autostart/ directory:\n\n[Desktop Entry]\nType=Application\nTryExec=/usr/bin/setxkbmap\nExec=/usr/bin/setxkbmap\nHidden=false\nNoDisplay=true\nX-GNOME-Autostart-enabled=true\nName[en_US]=System Keyboard Fix\nName=System Keyboard Fix\nComment[en_US]=Apply system-wide keyboard settings to the session\nComment=Applies system-wide keyboard settings to session\n\nThis fix seems to make the keyboard options consistent system-wide, with the exception of the brief period that LightDM has control of my screen before I log in.\n\nA: !!! Unfinished answer !!! (remove this warning if you know how to improve this answer)\nYou can use the command setxkbmap. For example\nsetxkbmap de\n\nsets the current layout to german. With\nsetxkbmap us\n\nyou can set it to the US layout.\nWarning: I think this command resets also other language options. For example the language icon disappears, when I run this command. Therefore it is also very difficult to change back to a layout with Latin letters, if you changed to something like Cyrilic, Chinese, Greek etc. But the command setxkbmap might be a good hint to continue research how to toggle the layout.\n\nA: setxkbmap -option grp:alt_shift_toggle en\n\n\nA: If you want to change it in tty consoles (those accessible through Ctrl+Alt+F1 or F2, ...) it is:\nloadkeys fr\n\nfor french or this one for US keyboard:\nloadkeys us\n\nThough, I'm not sure if it works for consoles launched in X.org/graphical mode (aka the Console application from Unity/Gnome or Konsole from KDE).

Once installed go to the Unity plugin (use the search box on the upper left) and click on the experimental. The setting you want is the Launcher Reveal Pressure I think.\n\nA: Install gconf-editor and browse to apps/panel/top level. Here you must have things like panel_0, panel_1, top_panel_screen0. Find the ones with autohide checked: these are your panels that you have set to autohide (obviously).

I'm basically looking for information so I can learn what LILO is. I recall trying to dual-boot Ubuntu with Windows and not being able to get into Windows. I had just wanted to get back my Windows after that. So any information to helping me learn about LILO is appreciated. Thanks! \n\nA: LILO is an alternative for GRUB. It is a Linux boot Loader. Because GRUB is has more features it is commonly used with most distributions. LILO is smaller, brilliant for booting from floppy disk, but otherwise can be considered a legacy application.\nHaving said that LILO is still used as the default boot loader by the Slackware distro which uses the most recent release: version 24.2 which came out on November 22nd 2015.\n\nA: LILO (See the man page for some configuration files) is a bootloader and a very old one at that. It even predates GRUB. Nowadays you will see that most systems will install GRUB. GRUB 2 (so the 2nd edition of GRUB) is the default boot loader and manager for Ubuntu since version 9.10 (Karmic Koala).\nWikipedia has this to say about LILO:\n\nLILO was the default boot loader for most Linux distributions in the years after the popularity of loadlin. Today, most distributions use GRUB as the default boot loader.\nLILO does not depend on a specific file system, and can boot an operating system (e.g., Linux kernel images) from floppy disks and hard disks. One of up to sixteen different images can be selected at boot time. Various parameters, such as the root device, can be set independently for each kernel. LILO can be placed either in the master boot record (MBR) or the boot sector of a partition. In the latter case something else must be placed in the MBR to load LILO.\nAt system start, only the BIOS drivers are available for LILO to access hard disks. For this reason, with very old BIOS, the accessible area is limited to cylinders 0 to 1023 of the first two hard disks. For later BIOS, LILO can use 32-bit \"logical block addressing\" (LBA) to access practically the entire storage of all the hard disks that the BIOS allows access to.\n\nI seriously doubt you have LILO installed. Where did you see that you have LILO? If you have a dual boot Ubuntu with Windows it -should- be GRUB that is installed on your machine. I don't think that you can install LILO from the installation CD (well at least not without using the alternate installation where you can get a menu with the installation steps).\n\nA: LILO is a boot loader. From what I know it's quite outdated. It was replaced in most distributions by GRUB or GRUB2. \nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LILO_%28boot_loader%29 \nMy guess is you probalby should download the grub2 boot CD and start your computer with that. It will recognize your windows and linux partitions, see which ones are bootable and allow you to boot them or even to replace your old bootmanager ... \nHope I got u right and that helps ... :-)\n", "Q: What are the benefits of sudo over su? What is the actual benefit that Ubuntu (or Debian derivatives) achieve by disabling root user?\nEverywhere I read, it says to prevent unintentional damages for inexperienced users.\nI want to know what exactly, since sudo can execute all commands (that I know/use). \nSo in what case root can cause damage whereas sudo can't? \nPS: I know how sudo works.\n\nA: It is about user/password management for sysadmins.\nIf you have multiple users, they should all have separate accounts and should be able to be tracked using those accounts. This means that people can't hide their identity. Also, if you need to revoke a specific users permissions you don't also have to reset the root password. To give every person in an environment with more than 2 admins the root password makes for a nightmare when one person quits. You must not only change it, but communicate it, etc. All this stuff also has to happen when one of them has a laptop stolen or stuff like that. One account with one password per person makes administration simpler. It is similar to the philosophy behind why each service should have its own account. If one account is compromised, you don't have to reconfigure another dozen services (such as backup tasks) to use a different account.\nI also find it personally convenient not to have yet another password to keep track of, lose and have compromised. On RHEL I specifically disable the root account after configuring sudo so I don't have to track it. Once in awhile a user b0rks the sudo file, but that's fixable in single-user mode. (Naturally, it is usually a production machine.)\nNOTE: 'sudo bash' will allow you to skip typing sudo for each command...\n\nA: \nSo in what case root can cause damage whereas sudo can't?\n\nSince you must usually invoke sudo each time you want to do something that requires privileges, the reasoning is that you will \"think before you leap\", i.e. not just stick sudo in front of something without thinking for a second what the command you're running is going to do.\nWith su on the other hand, once you're in, you're in. You have carte blanche (an open license) to do anything and everything, and the reasoning is you might forget for a moment that you have those privileges and if you're unlucky, execute something that will seriously affect/damage your system -- if you did not have su privileges, the command wouldn't have done anything serious.\n\nA: I think first, we need to look into what su and sudo actually are\nsu - stands for Substitute User. You use this to switch to a shell as another user using that user's password. Commonly used with root.\n Does not require a password when executed as root.\nsudo - allows a permitted user to execute a specified command as another user. Also commonly used with root. However, this allows you to specifically manage what commands may be executed as another use. (For instance, you could give a user the ability to run an init.d script but nothing else.)\nNote, you can always run sudo su or sudo -i and that will give you a root shell. However, no root password means no logging in directly as root... which means no one can break into that user. \nEDIT: so maybe this answer your looking for is:\nnot having a root password forces you to use sudo, which in turn naturally aligns you with the sudo philosophy which suggests you to enforce greater control over the actions run as root. \n\nA: In addition there are logging considerations to consider between sudo and su. Being su simply does everything as root with no entry other than one line in the auth log saying you became root. \nSudo on the other hand - always gets logged as your user ID with escalated priveleesw. \n\nA: IMO the major advantages of sudo over su are that sudo has superior logging of what commands were run and sudo gives finer control over what users can do.\nsu is all or none, but sudo can be configured to allow access to some, but not all commands.\nSee https://help.ubuntu.com/community/RootSudo for a more complete discussion, including advantages and disadvantages.\n\nA: su -\nWhen logged in as root, any task you start, action you trigger, or random event caused by visiting a certain website, etc. .. will run as super-user.\nsudo\nWhen you invoke sudo, as you run a command, only that command will run as super-user.\nYou will be asked for your password, before the command is executed.  So user-interaction by you is also required.\nAttempts to invoke sudo can also be logged.\n\nA: Usually, logging in as su is easier when performing administrative tasks.\nHowever, there is at least one exception:  when file ownership matters.\nIf you need a user to be the owner of a file, then log in as that user and use sudo to donwload or copy files.  Simple examples are bookmark and wallpaper files.  If a user does not own the file, a Firefox \"Restore\" bookmarks \"From File\" will fail.  When you set a desktop wallpaper, it may not work unless you own the file.\nSometimes you can just set privileges or enable as an executable file, but some settings or programs fail if you are not the owner of a file.\n", "Q: install artwiz fonts in ubuntu 12.04 I am trying to install the artwiz fonts in ubuntu 12.04 and following this thread.

But since many developers seem to be able to develop in this environment, there are probably tools / workflows that I'm missing. \nAs an example: quickly debug, which opens a python debugger does not help at all for lens development, unless the problem is directly in the code of the lens (which is easier found with simple unit tests). If the problem is in a service file, this does not help at all. I have had problems for example with whitespace in an application name in the .desktop file, which lead to a program not being listed in the sound menu (I think, maybe it was another menu...).\nSo: how are you debugging lenses, launchers, indicators, HUD methods... ?\nIs there a tool to check the integrity of a .service file?\nIs there a tool to check the integrity of a .desktop file? \nIs there a tool to see if there are collision in .desktop/.service files?

I want to scale all images in a given folder to the same width (but different appropriately scaled heights). How can I do this using  a GUI-based or command-line tool?\nFor bonus points, is it possible to restrict which images are scaled based on their initial width (that is, only scale images that have a width > x and/or a width < y)?\n\nA: For batch image resizing I’ve looked at many packages and finally found one with a usable interface – converseen. Once you discover that the important settings are somewhat hidden on the scrollable left pane, all is well.\nNot sure if this meets all of the OPs use cases, but you may not have to look at the quirky UIs of imagemagick or phatch.\nOddly, photo management packages like digikam, f-spot, fotoxx or shotwell don't seem to recognize the need for copying/resizing batches of images before uploading to online services like photobucket or (gag) flickr. These services want us to do things their way only so I do not trust them for backing up originals.\n\nA: For GUI, Phatch \"one click is worth thousand photos\" is the best for such quick job.\nIt is already in Ubuntu repository.\nsudo apt-get install phatch\n\n\n\n*\n\n*Add Scale & Save item\n\n*Set scale/resize options\n\n*Set save/output options\n\n*Run\n\n*Set input folder\n\n*Click batch to execute\n\n\n\n\n\nA: Try this:\nsudo apt-get install gimp-plugin-registry\n\nThen, open up Gimp and open the Batch plugin found in Filters > Batch > Batch Process.\nSelect your images in the Input tab, and define the Resize operation in the surprisingly-named Resize tab.\nMore information can be found here.\n\nA: Try mogrify command from ImageMagick tools.\n\n\n*\n\n*give a path to separate the output from originals\n\n*give desired thumbnail width or height, below a width example\n\n*this way you keep the original filename :-)\n\n\nExample:\n$ mogrify -path small/ -auto-orient -thumbnail 300x *.jpg\n\n\nA: This is very easy to do with imagemagick. You should be able to install it in the Software Center. I would suggest it for batch processing of images.\nThe batch resizing is incredibly simple (I tested it with Ubuntu 11.10). Use the following command to resize every .jpg file to 200 pixel width, keeping the aspect ratio:\n$ convert '*.jpg[200x]' resized%03d.png\n\nyou can maintain the filename by using -set option. Ex: \nconvert \"images/*.jpg[250x]\" -set filename:base \"%[basename]\" \"images/new_folder/%[filename:base].jpg\"\n\nIf you have more files you should use with find\nfind /folder -iname '*.JPG' -exec convert \\{} -verbose -set filename:base \"%[basename]\" -resize 1920x1080\\> \"/folder/images/%[filename:base].JPG\" \\;\n\nThis is only scratching the surface of the power of imagemagick. Resizing can be tuned endlessly. For more advanced resizing you have to use the -resize option.\nYou can limit the resizing to shrinking:\n$ convert '*.jpg[300x>]' thumb-300-%03d.png\n\nor enlarging:\n$ convert '*.jpg[300x<]' thumb-300-%03d.png\n\nHave look at the geometry documentation to see more options.\n\nA: Answered and accepted (and I use ImageMagick) but for completeness...

I use it from other linux machines too with Remmina client.\nTo use it with xfce, you need to install xubuntu-desktop (sudo apt-get install xubuntu-desktop)\n\nA: For LXDE:\n\n\n*\n\n*Install lxde-common:\nsudo apt-get install lxde-common\n\n\n*Make changes in /etc/xrdp/startwm.sh like this:\n#!/bin/sh\n\nif [ -r /etc/default/locale ]; then\n  . /etc/default/locale\n  export LANG LANGUAGE\nfi\n\n#. /etc/X11/Xsession\n\nstartlxde\n\n\nA: On Kubuntu 20.04 the following worked for me:\necho \"startplasma-x11\" > ~/.Xsession\n\nI assume similar will work for another desktops, just need to put proper launcher name, as described above.\n\nA: The systemctl command is specific to Fedora.  For Ubuntu, the command should be:\nsudo service xrdp restart\n\n\nA: This is all too confusing.  All you have to do is put the text in a file called .Xclients in your home directory that will specify the default desktop.  To see what's installed on your system and find out what they are called do:\nls /usr/share/xsessions\n\nYou will see files with an extension .desktop, for example mate.desktop\nTo make mate your default desktop you can then edit ~/.Xclients in your home folder, if you have such a file, or create one with nothing in it except your chosen desktop type (without the .desktop extension) with a -session appended:\necho mate-session > ~/.Xclients \n\nshould do this just fine. You can then log off and log back in, or if you are connected using xrdp you can restart xrdp, which will log you off and then you can log back in, (just log off and log back in, its stupid to get confused by restarting xrdp etc...)\nForget switchdesk - its broken in Fedora 23.\nForget most of what's on the web for prior Fedora versions, Ubuntu etc... None of it works.\n\nA: Here is an update As systemd is used by almost all Linux distributions systemctl command works with ubuntu versions like 18,19,20 and 21.\nTo use xfce4 Desktop, the commands below can be used:\nsesman.ini should be updated accordingly if you intend to have multi-user access.\nPolicy=UBDC\nsu -l user\n    \necho \"startxfce4\" > ~/.Xclients\n    \nchmod +x ~/.Xclients\n\nexit \n\nsu -l user2\n\necho \"startxfce4\" > ~/.Xclients\n\nchmod +x ~/.Xclients\n\nexit \n\nsu -l user3\n\necho \"startxfce4\" > ~/.Xclients\n\nchmod +x ~/.Xclients\n\nexit \n\nsudo systemctl enable --now xrdp.service\n\nwill enable and start the xrdp service.\n", "Q: Can you help me write a script to set a new default brightness for the screen/keyboard after login?

If not, you can always use your older kernel one of two ways:\n\n\n*\n\n*Boot into older kernel. Depending on how your kernel was installed, you might be able to boot into your old one by holding down Shift as the computer boots, bringing up the Grub Boot menu. On this menu, there might be an option entitled \"Previous Linux Versions\" and inside that menu, you might find your 3.2.0-24 kernel as an option. If not, read on...\n\n*Find a new kernel.

I am installing pycuda2011.2.2 on ubuntu 11.10, but can't complete it. Cuda is 4.0. When I do:\n$ make -j 4 \n\nI get this error:\n/usr/bin/ld: cannot find -lcuda \n/usr/bin/ld: skipping incompatible /usr/local/cuda/lib/libcurand.so when searching for -lcurand\n\nWhy this error? I think that cuda is 32 bit on 64 bit machine. But I can't see whether it's 32 bit or 64 bit. \nAlso, can anyone share code to make \"gcc 4.4\" as priority, just for my account and not all account?\n\nA: I don't understand why you would want to run make at all when building pycuda - it does not even have a Makefile (apart from the documentation).\nYou install pycuda by running ./configure.py with the appropriate options followed by LDFLAGS=-L/usr/lib/nvidia-current python setup.py install.\nYou need to set the LDFLAGS environment variable so that the pycuda setup can find libcuda.so, which on ubuntu systems is in a non-standard location (/usr/lib/nvidia-current).\nIf you're really asking about compiling the CUDA SDK (in which case you should definitely edit your question!), see my response on the NVIDIA forums.\n\nA: What about removing -lcuda from the Makefile? Last time I checked the toolkit and sdk, I could not find a libcuda.so file.\nThere have also been changes in the strictness of the compiler, so -lcuda must come after object files and other libraries which depend on it. You likely have to move -lcuda to the end of the $(CC) line (or whatever compiler command is used).\n", "Q: bind mounting read-only using fstab on Ubuntu? I need to remount one directory (/src) as readonly in another location (/dst). This can be done like this:\n$ sudo mount --bind /src /dst\n$ sudo mount -o remount,ro /dst\n\nHowever, I would like to use /etc/fstab to have the mount taking place at boot time and have seen different suggested solutions to this problem, e.g.\n/src  /dst    none  bind            0 0\n/src  /dst    none  remount,bind,ro 0 0\n\nwhich unfortunately leaves the directory mounted read/write on my system and this\n/src  /dst    none  bind            0 0\n/dst  /dst    none  remount,bind,ro 0 0\n\nwhich will issue an error when trying to mount /dst:\nmount: /dst not mounted already, or bad option\n\nThe above solutions supposedly works on different distros, but unfortunately not on Ubuntu 10.04.4 LTS (kernel 2.6.32-41-server).\nAny ideas how to accomplish this apart from placing the mount commands into /etc/rc.local?\n\nA: According to this LWN article, this behaviour snuck into the Kernel around version 2.6.25. In short if the target filesystem is rw, binding something on top can't convert it to ro.\nIn 2.6.26 they partially fixed things so you can trigger a remount (as you've discovered) but there's still no way to do that from within fstab.\n\nHere's what I was trying in fstab:\n/home/oli/Desktop/testmount  /mnt none bind,ro\n\nAfter firing a mount -a, /mnt was mounted but I could still create files. After then firing off sudo mount -o remount /mnt, it became read-only.\nSo yes, I think the cleanest method is to either have a line in  /etc/rc.local or write a super-simple Upstart script that starts on the mountall event (so it happens immediately).\n\nA: On older kernels, mount --bind cannot create a read-only view of a read-write filesystem. The kernel stores the read-write status of the filesystem in a single place which is not duplicated by the bind mount. Newer kernels allow this but still require a separate mount step: first bind, then make read-only. There is a kernel patch to change that, and some distributions (such as Debian) have applied it, but Ubuntu hasn't (at least not as of 12.04).\nOne solution is to create the read-only view from a boot script instead from /etc/fstab, as Oli explains.\nOtherwise, you can use bindfs instead. This is a FUSE filesystem. Going through FUSE is slightly slower as it introduces an additional layer of indirection. You also lose support for extended file metadata such as ACLs. On the flip side, the read-only view will have a recognizable filesystem type, making it easy to exclude from filesystem traversals (such as locate and backups).\nThe fstab entry looks like this:\nbindfs#/src  /dst  fuse perms=a=rX\n\n", "Q: What is the purpose of the Ubuntu One folder? Using Ubuntu One, I can sync my Home folders with Ubuntu One, which is great. But what is the purpose of the Ubuntu One folder that is in my Home folder? \nDoes it have special privileges that my other folders don't have? Why would I use it?\nAnd can it safely be removed?\n\nA: I think that the Ubuntu One folder has two purposes:\n1) as you already says, there is a sub-folder to share stuff with others\n2) the first time you install U1, and you have 5GB of free space to use, there is at least one folder ready for the syncing without knowing nothing about the U1 system\n\nA: The Ubuntu One folder is always in sync, I believe. Any files/folders that you put into the Ubuntu One folder will automatically be synced. \nRead this: https://one.ubuntu.com/help/tutorial/install-and-setup-file-sync/\n\nA: By default, the folder named 'Ubuntu One' serves as the root folder for the u1syncdaemon.\nSo when displaying your U1 files through https://one.ubuntu.com/files/, everything residing in this folder (including subfolders) is synced, and additionally synced folders (e.g. ~/mybackup/subfolder, see u1sdtool --list-folders) appear as links/subfolders under this root with the title 'My synced folders' folder there.\nFor some reason this might not be displayed consistently across all clients, I noticed that e.g. the current Android client shows additionally synced folders as a sibling of the root folder.\nNote that it is possible (as of 12.04, maybe earlier as well?) to change that root folder to another folder within your home as described in this answer but make sure you know what you are doing and stop the syncdaemon prior to any changes through u1sdtool --quit (and start it again afterwards).\nAfter doing so, I was able to remove that folder safely and use another one of my choice instead.\n\nA: Another use of Ubuntu One folder is for sharing folder between diferent users. The sharing folders are locate in Ubuntu One folder.\n", "Q: \"rm\" doesn't accept internal command as a paramter Why doesn't this work?\nrm $(gsettings get org.gnome.desktop.background picture-uri  | awk '{gsub(\"file://\",\"\");print $0}')\nrm: cannot remove `\\'/home/foggy/obrazky/wallpapers/24/Dark_Oxygen_by_Falco101.png\\'': No such file or directory\n\nPerhaps there is some character that rm doesn't accept?\n\nA: Look closely and you'll notice that it has embedded single quotes, which you will have to remove yourself.  I would change the awk to a sed:\nrm $(gsettings get org.gnome.desktop.background picture-uri |\n     sed -e \"s/'//g\" -e 's,file://,,g')\n\n(Although actually I would look at exactly what the unmodified output of gsettings looks like first, so as to make something a bit more bulletproof.)\n\nA: gsettings get org.gnome.desktop.background picture-uri returns a result like:\n'file:///usr/share/backgrounds/Tie_My_Boat_by_Ray_Garc%C3%ADa.jpg'\nThose single-quotes at the ends are your undoing :-)\nI'll assume you're using awk for a reason, and give you two simple solutions which strip the quotes before feeding the output of gsettings to awk:\n\n\n*\n\n*cut -d \"'\" -f2\n\n*tr \"'\" \" \"\nStick them in the middle and you're done, e.g.:\n\nrm $(gsettings get org.gnome.desktop.background picture-uri |   \n`cut -d \"'\" -f2` | sed -e \"s/'//g\" -e 's,file://,,g')\n\nrm $(gsettings get org.gnome.desktop.background picture-uri |   \n`tr \"'\" \" \"` | sed -e \"s/'//g\" -e 's,file://,,g')\n\n\nA: It looks like you have an extra pair of single quote characters around your filename that need to be stripped off.\nHere, I have a file named \"hello\":\n$ ls\nhello\n\nTrying to delete it with extra single quotes like this:\n$ rm \"'hello'\"\n\ngives exactly the error message you see:\nrm: cannot remove `\\'hello\\'': No such file or directory\n\nthe \\' before and after the name are single quotes you need to strip off.\nEDIT:\nIn your case (as another answerer has noted) the output of\ngsettings get org.gnome.desktop.background picture-uri\n\nreturns a result like:\n'file:///usr/share/backgrounds/Tie_My_Boat_by_Ray_Garc%C3%ADa.jpg'\n\nSo you want to strip the leading 'file:// and the ending '. This can be done correctly using sed like this (using only one expression with a group)\nsed -e \"s|^'file://\\(.*\\)'$|\\1|g\"\n\nor maybe easier to read (using two simple expressions)\nsed -e \"s|^'file://||g\" -e \"s|'$||\"\n\nPlease note:\n\n\n*\n\n*^ matches the beginning of the line \n\n*$ matches the end of the line.\n\n*any character can be used in sed to surround the search and replace expressions. Normally, you would use / but in this case it is easier to use something else, so I use |.\n\n\nA: This would work too (although not particularly secure):\neval rm $(gsettings get org.gnome.desktop.background picture-uri  | awk '{gsub(\"file://\",\"\");print $0}')\n\n", "Q: Is 10.04 LTS Still Supported by the Ubuntu Desktop Advanced?

I can use Grub-Customizer to edit which options appear in the Grub menu. I was thinking of removing everything except the option to boot into Ubuntu and into Windows.\nIf I was to do this how could I boot into the recovery modes of these two operating systems if I needed to?\n\nA: To start Ubuntu in Recovery Mode\nYou can do so from the Grub menu.\n1 - Show the menu\n\n\n*\n\n*If the menu is displayed during boot, the automatic countdown may be\nstopped by pressing any key other than the Enter key.\n\n*If the menu is not normally displayed during boot, hold down the\nShift key as the computer attempts to boot to display the GRUB 2\nmenu.

(In my case, that would mean to delete quiet splash vt.handoff=7.)\n\n*Now, append the following to the line (after ro): recovery nomodeset\nThe final line looks like this for me: linux /boot/vmlinuz-3.0.0-19-generic root=UUID=74d6aa6a-5170-4a36-b5b8-72e9c3db3989 ro recovery nomodeset\n\n*When that's done, hit CTRL-X to boot with the temporarily changed settings.\nNote: Edits made to the menu in this manner are non-persistent. They remain in effect only for the current boot.\n\n*Ubuntu will now load in Recovery mode.\nMore info on editing the Grub menu during boot can be found here.\nTo start Windows in Safe Mode\nThis is actually really simple.\n\n\n*\n\n*Select Windows from the Grub menu.\n\n*Once your selection is made, repeatedly hit F8 until a menu appears.\n\n*From here, you will be able to choose which mode to start Windows in, such as Safe Mode or Command Prompt.\n\n\nA: To start Windows in Safe Mode from GRUB2:\nThe standard recipe is to press F8(an hold it pressed) as fast as possible, after selecting your Windows entry from Grub. For Windows 7 and XP it should work.\nHowever, in Windows 8/8.1 F8 key did not seem to work. Some claimed that because of the extremely fast booting of Windows 8.1, it is being uncapable of detecting any input(including the F8) from your keyboard while booting. I have searched on multiple forums, blogs, etc. this problem and found a solution, after lot of documentation.\nMany people advise to use the bcdedit /set {default} bootmenupolicy legacy command\nfor making F8 key work while booting on Windows 8.1, but  for me didn’t work like this.\nIf the bcdedit /set {default} bootmenupolicy legacy gives you the following output:\n\n\"The boot configuration data store could not be opened. The system cannot find the file specified.\" \n\nas it did for me follow the instructions from [1](the answer marked as the right one).\nIf you do not want to document yourself reading the answer from [1], just type the following command:\nbcdedit /store c:\\Boot\\BCD /set bootmenupolicy legacy\n\nIt worked for me.\n[1]http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_7-performance/bcdedit-the-system-cannot-find-the-file-specified/7135b90a-c6a4-4a31-b752-822029671075\nExplanations:\n\n\n*\n\n*Boot Configuration Data (BCD) files provide a store that is used to describe boot applications and boot application settings. The objects and elements in the store effectively replace Boot.ini.\n\n*BCDEdit is a command-line tool for managing BCD stores. It can be used for a variety of purposes, including creating new stores, modifying existing stores, adding boot menu options, and so on. BCDEdit serves essentially the same purpose as Bootcfg.exe on earlier versions of Windows, but with two major improvements.\nAdministrative privileges are required to use BCDEdit to modify BCD.\n\n*/set Sets an entry option value.  \n\n*/store\nThis option can be used with most BCDedit commands to specify the store to be used. If this option is not specified, then BCDEdit operates on the system store.\nSo when you open cmd with the option \"Run as administrator\" you are in C:\\Windows\\system32\nand that is why system cannot find the file specified, so you must specify it c:\\Boot\\BCD. \n\n*bootmenupolicy [ Legacy | Standard ]\nDefines the type of boot menu the system will use. For Windows 8.1, Windows 8 and Windows RT the default is Standard. For Windows Server 2012 R2, Windows Server 2012, the default is Legacy. When Legacy is selected, the Advanced options menu (F8) is available. When Standard is selected, the boot menu will appear only under certain conditions: for example, if there is a startup failure, if you are booting up from a repair disk or installation media, if you have configured multiple boot entries, or if you manually configured the computer to use Advanced startup. When Standard is selected, the F8 key is ignored during boot. Windows 8 PCs start up quickly so there isn't enough time to press F8. For more information, see Windows Startup Settings (including safe mode).\nNote:  The option is available starting with Windows 8 and Windows Server 2012. You can also use the onetimeadvancedoptions to use the Advanced options (F8) menu (Legacy) one time on the next boot.\n", "Q: Set nomodeset in usb installation (efi loader with iso) I'm working with the studyblast solution to creating a live USB on OS X.

I experience a huge drop in game performance since my fresh install of ubuntu 12.04\nMy PC consists of an Nvidia Geforce GTX 460, AMD Phenom II X4 965 CPU and 4GB of RAM and I use nvidias proprietary driver.\nI mainly play Heroes of Newerth by using their linux client. I do this since ubuntu 9.10 and I had never experienced any performance issues when using the proprietary nvidia driver. My fps was always maxed to the vsync frame cap of 60.\nSince I run ubuntu 12.04 I get around 30-45 fps and game experience in general is very laggy. I know that there are a lot of people having issues with nvidias 295.40 driver, which is sadly installed by default in ubuntu 12.04. So I manually installed the latest stable 295.49, latest beta 302.07 and even the older version 295.33 used in ubuntu 11.10 (where I never had any issues with performance). It was a waste of time since I was experiencing the same performance problems with all 4 driver versions.\nWhen I use Unity 2D my fps is back to 60 and overall game performance is great.\nSo I only have those issues when running ubuntu 12.04's version of Unity.\nI also tried to delete my .config and .compiz-1 folders in the home directory but still game performance is a mess when using unity.\nI don't know what to try next...\nDoes anybody know how I can further debug the issue? \nMaybe how I can provide more data to better analyse the problem?\nMaybe try to fiddle with some compiz settings?\nThis performance regression is really frustrating and I am thinking of just downloading Heroes of Newerth's windows client and going back to dual boot since this is simply unacceptable.\nAny help appreciated.\n\nA: It's not a real solution, but at least it might be a (hopefully) useful workaround (apart from simply using Unity 2D).\nBefore you start a game, open up Nautilus (the file manager) and go to /usr/share/application. Open up a terminal, type metacity --replace, and press enter. Don't panick, the Unity interface will disappear, but this is my intention. Launch the game from the file manager (the launcher for the game should be in the folder I mentioned). After you finish playing your game, type unity --replace in the terminal window, and press enter. Your desktop is now restored to how it was.\nThis should work as it's probably Unity running in the background that's causing trouble.\nAlso, I'd report this as a bug. It's definitely something that needs to be fixed. If you submit a bug report, be sure to leave a link here so other people who are experiencing this problem can mark it as \"affecting them\", which will get it fixed sooner.\n\nA: You could always update to the 304.22 Nvidia Beta drivers and see what happens.  I was having huge performance issues with Ubuntu 12.04 LTS and the Nvidia 295.59 version & the 302.07 version seemed to fix some minor things. Most of the issues have been resolved by updating the latest 304.22 driver.  Now my GeForce performance is finally equal to Windows XP but there are still minor issues from a few applications but the situation is really improved significantly.  You should use the latest Nvidia drivers at all times, even if they are in BETA because it seems that the older stable ones aren't tested by Nvidia's team on newer Kernel and Ubuntu rolling updates causing unexpected problem and issues. Problem is that Nvidia needs to Open Source their drivers so that Ubuntu maintainers and Linux developers can keep everything in sync but that's an ongoing discussion that will not resolve anytime soon :-(\nYou can obtain them http://www.geforce.com/drivers/beta-legacy \nThe 304.22 drivers have tons of large scale fixes like:\n\n\n*Added support for the following GPUs: \n*GeForce GTX 680MQuadro K1000MQuadro K2000M\n*Enhanced the functionality of the IncludeImplicitMetaModes Xconfiguration option: \n*Implicit MetaModes will be added for the primary display device,even if multiple display devices are in use when X is initialized. \n*Implicit MetaModes will be added for common resolutions, even if there isn't a mode with that resolution in the mode pool of the display device. \n*Extended the syntax of the IncludeImplicitMetaModes configuration option, e.g., to control which display device isused for creation of implicit MetaModes. See the description of the IncludeImplicitMetaModes X configurationoption in the README for details.\n*Modified the handling of the RandR 1.0/1.1 requests RRGetScreenInfo and RRSetScreenConfig (e.g., `xrandr -q --q1` and `xrandr --size ...` and `xrandr --orientation ...`) such that they operate on MetaModes. This was the behavior in NVIDIA X driver versions 295.xx and earlier, but 302.xx releases altered the handling of these RandR 1.0/1.1 requests to operate on a single RandR output's modes. \n*With the above changes to IncludeImplicitMetaModes and RandR 1.0/1.1 handling, fullscreen applications (e.g., SDL-based applications, Wine), should have more resolutions available to them, and should interact better with multiple monitor configurations. \n*Fixed a bug that could cause G8x, G9x, and GT2xx GPUs to display a black screen or corruption after waking up from suspend. \n*Fixed several bugs that could cause some OpenGL programs to hang when calling fork(3). \n*Fixed an nvidia-settings bug that caused the results of ProbeDisplays queries made with the --display-device-string option to be formatted incorrectly. \n*Improved the responsiveness of updates to the nvidia-settings control panel when displays are hotplugged. \n*Fixed a bug that caused display corruption when setting some transforms, especially when panning a transformed display. \n*Fixed a bug that caused extra RandR events to be generated the first time a display is hotplugged. \n*Fixed a bug that caused X11 modelines with '@' in their names to be rejected. \n*Added support for DisplayPort 1.2 branch devices, which allow multiple displays to be connected to a single DisplayPort connector on a graphics board. \n*Fixed a bug that caused most OpenGL texture uploads to be slow when the context was bound rendering to an RGB overlay drawable. \n*Fixed a bug that caused audio over HDMI to not work after restarting the X server on some MCP7x (IGP) GPUs. \n*Updated the X configuration option \"UseDisplayDevice\" to honor the value \"none\" on any GPU. \n*Added support for DKMS in nvidia-installer. Installing the kernel module through DKMS allows the module to be rebuilt automatically when changing to a different Linux kernel. See the README and the nvidia-installer help text or the \"--dkms\" option. \n*Added RandR output properties _ConnectorLocation, ConnectorNumber,ConnectorType, EDID, _GUID, and SignalFormat. See the README for details on these properties. \n*Extended support for Base Mosaic to all G80+ SLI configurations with up to three displays. \n*Fixed a bug that caused some monitors to fail to wake from DPMS suspend mode when multiple DisplayPort monitors were attached to one GPU. \n*Removed controls for XVideo attributes from the \"X Server XVideo Settings\" page of the nvidia-settings control panel. XVideo attributes can be configured in XVideo player applications, or through utilities such as xvattr. \n*Fixed a bug that caused all ports on an XVideo adaptor to share color correction settings. \n*Removed support for the following X configuration options: \n*SecondMonitorHorizSyncSecondMonitorVertRefreshSimilar control is available through the NVIDIA HorizSync and VertRefresh X configuration options. Please see the NVIDIA driver README for details.\n*Fixed a bug that prevented NVIDIA 3D Vision Pro from working properly when switching between X servers on different VTs. \n*Added support for desktop panning when rotation, reflection, or transformation is applied to a display device (either through RandR or through the MetaMode syntax); panning would previously be ignored in that case. \n\nA: EDIT: X is now lockable thru xscreensaver\nhi! try this, I am having great results using it, mostly for games!\nAs it wont be managed by Unity, you may have great results too!\nI have created this script that creates a new X session and runs a command or open a terminal so you can run it there.\nopenNewX.sh\n#!/bin/bash\n\nfunction FUNCisX1running {\n  ps -A -o command |grep -v \"grep\" |grep -q -x \"X :1\"\n}\n\nuseJWM=true\nuseKbd=true\nwhile [[ ${1:0:2} == \"--\" ]]; do\n  if [[ \"$1\" == \"--no-wm\" ]]; then #opt SKIP WINDOW MANAGER (run pure X alone)\n    useJWM=false\n    shift\n  elif [[ \"$1\" == \"--no-kbd\" ]]; then #opt SKIP Keyboard setup\n    useKbd=false\n    shift\n  elif [[ \"$1\" == \"--isRunning\" ]]; then #opt check if new X :1 is already running\n    if FUNCisX1running; then\n      exit 0\n    else\n      exit 1\n    fi\n  elif [[ \"$1\" == \"--help\" ]]; then #opt show help info\n    echo \"usage: options runCommand\"\n\n    # this sed only cleans lines that have extended options with \"--\" prefixed\n    sedCleanHelpLine='s\"\\(.*\\\"\\)\\(--.*\\)\\\".*#opt\" \\2\"' #helpskip\n    grep \"#opt\" $0 |grep -v \"#helpskip\" |sed \"$sedCleanHelpLine\"\n\n    exit 0\n  else\n    #echoc -p \"invalid option $1\"\n    echo \"PROBLEM: invalid option $1\"\n    $0 --help\n    exit 1\n  fi\ndone\n#echo \"going to execute: $@\"\n#runCmd=\"$1\" #this command must be simple, if need complex put on a script file and call it!\nrunCmd=\"$@\" #this command must be simple, if need complex put on a script file and call it!\n\n#if ! echoc -q -t 2 \"use JWM window manager@Dy\"; then\n#  useJWM=false\n#fi\n\n# run in a thread, prevents I from ctrl+c here what breaks THIS X instace and locks keyb\nif !

I've recently installed 12.04 on my PC but I am finding that it takes an eternity to install software using the software center. My PC has more than enough power to handle this (I'm running a 64 bit machine), so it's not a hardware issue. I've seen a similar thread to this but no clear answer on how to remedy the problem was given.

You can even tab complete the names of the packages you're looking for, in case you're not entirely sure what they're called.

I used GIMPs Colors -> Map -> Color Exchange to edit the color to my liking.\nLong Answer (had inline images, but my rep is too low)\nI first used the referenced answer to delete the background PNG as described and then was able to locate the file(s) you want to edit. In my case, I found that just changing the glow was not enough.\nFirst make a back up of the two files, launcher_icon_selected_back_150.png and launcher_icon_glow_200.png.\ncd /usr/shar/unity/5\nsudo cp launcher_icon_selected_back_150.png launcher_icon_selected_back_150.png.bak\nsudo cp launcher_icon_glow_200.png launcher_icon_glow_200.png.bak\n\nYou can edit the two files however you like.

On one of my machines I have a process running called \"whoopsie\". I'm running 12.04 server and never specifically installed anything with this name.\nGoogle seems to imply that it has something to with error logs but I'm not finding too much information.

It takes the crash reports that apport creates and presents whenever an application fails and sends them to a Canonical server for further processing. The data collected from these reports help us prioritize and track the most pressing issues:\nhttps://errors.ubuntu.com\nThe small (in disk space, not necessarily CPU/RAM usage) whoopsie daemon process is run by default on both Ubuntu desktop and server installations. It will only send reports out if you explicitly approve this in the dialog that appears on desktop installs, or in the case of the server, manually run apport-cli.\nYou can disable it by going into System Settings -> Privacy -> Diagnostics and unchecking the box labelled \"Send error reports to Canonical.\"\nTo disable it on Ubuntu Server, edit the /etc/default/whoopsie file and change report_crashes= to false, then run sudo stop whoopsie.\nNote that if you do this, we will not be made aware of the problems affecting your computer and may be unable to fix them.

The process continued with the same PID, which means that the process was not ended.\nThen I restarted the computer and the computer could not shut down because \"whoopsie\" was still running and could not be ended. So I had to press and hold the power button until the computer went out.\nThe worst thing is that \"whoopsie\" uploaded a large amount of data to the internet at the time and I have no idea what.\nAfter that I deleted \"whoopsie\" from my PC with:\napt remove --purge whoopsie && apt autoremove && apt autoclean && restart\n\nwhoopsie screenshot\n---EDIT--\nI forgot to say, whoopsie connected through the closed firewall.

This is accomplished by going into the System Systems > Privacy center and setting the internet connectivity option to Off.\nThe mulberry connection is as other answers indicate, the geoip package, which the provided link explains.\n\nA: One is a Ubuntu GeoIP Provider and the others are scopes. \nTo list what services are connecting to IP addresses try sudo lsof -n -P -i +c 15\nUbuntu GeoIp Provider\nI don't know what the geoip provider connection is for, what it does, or why we've been told we need it. I can find little information about it, and any attempted explanations about what it is for are ambiguous, at best. This is the only rogue connection I have left.\nWhat I do know, is that geoip calls home every time you connect to the internet, and also at seemingly arbitrary times too. In 12.10 these connections increase.\nWhat is the value of this connection? Who knows. Ubuntu, in its infinite wisdom, obviously feels there is a value. Why else would they implement a connection that always calls home, is enabled by default, and does not have an option to disable? \nChanging Settings > Time & Date > Automatically from the internet -> Manually will not stop geoip connections.\nFor more on ubuntu-geoip-provider read Is ubuntu-geoip geoclue used for tracking.

Example, open your dash, then click on the video icon (Super+v), then search for a video. If you have a video scope installed, you will see an \"Online Videos\" section in the results that are displayed. Those results are from your video scope!  The video scope has queried its video data provider and returned videos relevant to your search. \nYou may have other scopes, e.g. music (super+m), photos, amazon, ebay, etc.\nA scope is used with a lens.\nFor more information: What exactly is a lens and What's the difference between a lens & scope.\nTo check what scopes and lens are currently installed you can use dpkg with grep: \n\n\n*\n\n*What scopes are installed? dpkg -l | grep scope\n\n*What lens's are installed? dpkg -l | grep lens\nExample:\n$ dpkg -l | grep lens\nii  unity-lens-applications    5.12.0-0ubuntu1    Application lens for unity\nii  unity-lens-files           5.10.0-0ubuntu1    File lens for unity\n\n\n\n*\n\n*What do the various dpkg flags like 'ii' 'rc' mean?\nTo see what scopes and lens you can install search the Software Center for Unity Lens & unity Scope, or use apt-get:\n$ apt-get install unity-lens-<Hit Tab Twice For Auto Complete>\nunity-lens-applications  unity-lens-files         \nunity-lens-music         unity-lens-wikipedia     \nunity-lens-askubuntu     unity-lens-gwibber       \nunity-lens-video         \n\n$ apt-get install unity-scope-<Hit Tab Twice For Auto Complete>\nunity-scope-musicstores   unity-scope-video-remote\n\nRemoving Scopes\nYou can remove scopes with no problems, after all, they are just data providers.\nsudo apt-get remove unity-scope-video \n\nI removed the video scope and I don't have any PID/python connections anymore. I can't search for online videos from the dash, but I never used that feature anyways.\nScopes in 12.10\n12.10 introduces an option to disable network connections when seaching in the dash.

Not sure what this means.\nAlso note that I'm running VIM in a terminal.\nSo how do I copy text into the Primary Selection in VIM?\nGoal is to copy text from VIM into Google Chrome.\n\nA: You need a version of vim that has +clipboard in its version. Install the vim-gnome package and you should be fine. (And you don't have to use gvim to use the clipboard, it still works when running vim in a terminal.)\nNote\nIn more recent versions, the actual package name seems to be vim-gtk and vim-gtk3 respectively (vim-gnome is a dummy package).\n\nA: \"+y uses a special register and is part of the clipboard feature of vim. Since your version of vim doesn't support clipboard (-clipboard means, clipboard feature isn't available), you need to use something else.\nYou can try this plugin, which doesn't depend on the clipboard feature and should work in the pure terminal version of vim. It seems that it depends on one of the programs screen, xclip, tmux.\n\nA: What worked for me on Ubuntu 18.04 was having one of the graphical packages installed (vim-gtk or vim-gtk3) and remove the package vim. This will set the alternative for vim from /usr/bin/vim.basic to e. g. /usr/bin/vim.gtk.\nThe alternative can also be selected manually with\n $ sudo update-alternatives --config vim\n\n\nA: If your vim has the clipboard support you can:\n:%y*\n\n* .............. primary selection\n\n", "Q: Why won't my laptop detect my VGA cable after start-up? I plug the VGA cable from my computer to the TV.  After that, I turn the computer on. The display is shown on the TV but once the Ubuntu login screen appears, my connection is then lost. \nAre there any good suggestions on how to fix this?\n\nA: Your question is rather vague, so you'll more likely get more useful answers if you can provide more information. Here's some things to start with:\nWhat graphics card drivers are you using? I've found that the generic drivers tend to not play well with multiple monitors. Make sure you pick up the good drivers for your graphics card. If you have an Nvidia card, or a newer ATI/AMD card, then you may need to tell Ubuntu to use the \"non-free\" software and install the proprietary drivers.\nCan you output to a standard monitor? Does the same cable and port output successfully to a regular computer monitor? If not, the cable or the card might be bad. Swap out the cable and see if it works, then try the TV again. \nDoes the graphics card support the TV's resolution? (Conversely, does the TV support the card's available resolutions?) Graphics cards output only certain resolutions, and monitors (including TVs) only display at certain resolutions. Usually, the card will automatically match up the best fit. However, it will usually try to do that and maintain the monitor's aspect ratio and will fail if it doesn't find one, even if there's a match at a less than ideal aspect ratio. Check your display software (either the built-in \"Display\" system settings, or Nvidia's or ATI/AMD configuration manager) to see if it's actually detected but can't output at the resolution that it wants.\nIs the output turned on? Sometimes, the computer won't detect the monitor until you tell it to connect (even though it outputs to the other monitor until login). Check your display settings and see if it does know that it's there, but doesn't know what to do with it.\n", "Q: update android phone os with ubuntu 12.04 How do i update an android phone from 2.2 froyo to 2.3 gingerbread with Ubuntu 12.04 ? \nDoes this process require Windows ?\nI am using Ubuntu 12.04 on a core i3 machine.\nThanks in advance.\nragv\n\nA: In theory, an Android phone doesn't need a computer to upgrade. In practice, this is usually the case - all I had to do to upgrade was home, menu, settings, about phone, software version, check for updates, apply. (It was something like that, but it's also sometimes a little different by phone as well.)\nIt should be noted that occasionally, a company will force you to use their proprietary desktop software to upgrade your phone. They will almost certainly distribute their software for only Windows, and so unless it works in WINE or Mono it won't work in Linux. What kind of Android phone do you have?\nAlso, if you plan on rooting and using a custom ROM, all you need for this is to put the ROM on the micro-SD card in the phone, which can be done on whatever OS you like. Again, it's an entirely phone-contained process after you root. Rooting works on Windows, Mac, and Linux; you need to have the android SDK setup and Mono set up and use SuperOneClick.\n\nA: It's possible. You just need to backup your phone's firmware using something like ROM Manager from the Google Play Store (Market) and then use it to install a ROM with Gingerbread on your phone. It would help if we knew what model your phone is. \n\nA: Android does its own upgrades via phone but when a total new distro change is needed, it needs a software suite and time is long due for a Linux version of that particular update suite.\n", "Q: Updating release versions before hardware is certified My laptop, a Thinkpad SL510, is certified* on Ubuntu 11.04. I upgraded to 11.10 and then 12.04. After a month long fight to keep a decent wifi signal and trying numerous fixes, I gave up and reinstalled 11.04. However, now, I continually get notices to upgrade to 11.10. \nMy question is why would I want to update to 11.10 or 12.04 without those versions being tested against my hardware? \n\n\n*\n\n*http://www.ubuntu.com/certification/hardware/201011-6830/\n\nA: First of all, you don't have to upgrade (though upgrading sooner, especially if you're not on an LTS release, makes it easier, and quicker, to upgrade later). You can turn off release update notifications in the updater settings.\nThat said, just because a set of hardware hasn't been certified for a particular version, it doesn't mean it won't work. It's kind of like the little \"Built for Windows XP\" stickers on Windows machines - just because it was built for XP, it doesn't mean that Windows 7 or Linux won't work on it. However, it does mean that it might take more work to make it work or make it work ideally. You may have to compile drivers from source or download them a third party location, for example (compiling is not terribly painful, but not for novices, either). If you're running a modern computer, you usually don't run into such issues with upgrading, because the drivers will generally be the same (where you would run into issues is with legacy hardware, since you can't really expect built-in support for something like your 20-year-old dot matrix printer to continue indefinitely, they have to draw the line somewhere).\nIn your case, it sounds like there's a bug in the wireless drivers in 12.04 for your card. The easy thing to do is to hold off on upgrading for a month or two. This gives developers time to update the drivers for the new system. (On a side note, have you tried just going to 11.10? Depending on when the bug was introduced, you may be able to upgrade to 11.10 without issue, buying you more time before the release you're using goes end of life.)\nHardware matters aside, it's generally a good idea to update on some kind of regular basis, because the versions go end of life every few releases (non-LTS goes end-of-life every 18 months, or 3 releases). Once they go end of life, you won't get updates at all, and Canonical will pull the repositories entirely.\nUpdating also provides you with (easy) access to newer (or the newest) versions of your software, as well as things like kernel and security updates. In the case of Linux distros running Gnome 3 or Unity, it also means interface and usability enhancements, as these new technologies are refined.\n", "Q: Allow Connections to VNC Server Only From Specific IP Addresses I administrate an Ubuntu 11.10 Server. I've installed tightvncserver on it so I can have a desktop environment on the server.\nMy issue now is, I'm running into issues with malicious people spamming the VNC server with authentication attempts. I've strengthened up the password, but it's still inconvenient as it restricts me from connecting as the person is using up all the authentication attempts.\nThere are pretty much around 5 IP addresses that should be able to ATTEMPT to authenticate to the VNC server, this person is using proxies from Romania, China, Korea, etc. \nHow can I accept authentication attempts to ONLY the IP addresses I specify?\nEssentially, I want to do the opposite of this: How to deny VNC access to a particular IP?\nAnd this with VNC instead: How can I allow SSH password authentication from only certain IP addresses?\nAny ideas?\nThanks,\nBrandon\n\nA: You could use ufw - the \"uncomplicated firewall\" that comes with a standard ubuntu install.\nsudo ufw allow 22/tcp\nsudo ufw allow 5901/tcp from 12.34.56.78\nsudo ufw default reject incoming\nsudo ufw enable\n\nWhich is:\n\n\n*\n\n*allow ssh connections (otherwise you will lock yourself out)\n\n*allow VNC connections from one IP address (edit the port if you don't use 5901)\n\n*reject all other incoming connections\n\n*enable the firewall\n\n\nMake sure you allow ssh before enabling the firewall, otherwise you'll be locked out.\n", "Q: Ubuntu 12.04 using UEFI I want to upgrade my machine with a new Motherboard, RAM and Processor.\nI am planning on doing a clean install of Ubuntu 12.04.\nThe Motherboard I want to use is an \nAsrock 970 Extreme4 which uses an AMI 32 MBit UEFI BIOS.\nMy Question is, is there anything I have to watch out for during the installation process? Cause I have read that some people have trouble booting into ubuntu using a UEFI BIOS. Any advice? I don't want to spend all that money for the different parts only to find out that I can only use windows properly.\nThanks in advance\n\nA: IMHO, Ubuntu creates an EFI System Partition (ESP) that's a fraction of its proper size. I recommend creating an ESP in the range of 100-500 MiB, depending on various factors; but Ubuntu tends to make them under 50 MiB, IIRC. Ubuntu also creates FAT-16 ESPs, but the Windows installer flakes out when presented with FAT-16 ESPs -- it wants to see a FAT-32 ESP. These problems can be overcome by pre-partitioning (or at least creating the ESP ahead of time). Be aware, though, that Ubuntu 11.10 and earlier always erase the ESP, which wipes out other OSes' boot loaders. This problem has been fixed with Ubuntu 12.04. Thus, for an EFI install, I strongly recommend Ubuntu 12.04 over earlier versions.\n\nA: None that I ran into.  The only issue I had was when I first installed, it crapped out because the uefi system picked up the dvdrw that it booted off of.  Once I went in and told it that it was the main boot device, it worked fine.\n\nA: I just got an ASUS K55a laptop with win7 home premium on it.\nI unplugged the hard drive, plugged in a flash drive and proceeded to install Linux Mint (Ubuntu Derivative).\nThe flash drive worked.\nI plugged the HD back in and started the computer.\nWindows crashed and forced me to reformat and reinstall, leaving linux inoperable.\nThe laptop has uefi on it.\nI wanted to select which drive I wanted to boot from during computer startup but apparently this only works with an older computer.\nI don't want or need a boot manager when I can select which to boot from on my own.\nIs there a way for me to do this without windows crashing?\nI have to keep win7 until the warranty runs out in a year. But I can run Linux all I want as long as I don't fool with the hard drive.\nI don't want to run from CD/DD as it is too slow.\nAnd I am scared to access the hard drive from Linux let alone try to save anything to it.\nI suggest that you Pull the windows drive out and put in an ssd drive for linux. Switch when needed.\nA hassle yes, but at least you don't have to worry about windows getting sick.\n", "Q: Windows-based Network With Ubuntu Server? I'd like to add an Ubuntu Server to a network including several Windows7 machines.\nWhat must I do in order to allow the Ubuntu Server to be 'allowed' to access the home directory on each one of the windows7 machines, and copy them over (for backup purposes)?\nAlso, once I install MySQL on the Ubuntu Server, how do I 'allow' all the Windows7 machines to connect to it (I'd like them to be able to query/update the databases etc)?\nPlease and thank you.\n\nA: As for the first question, what you are asking is kind of the reverse of what is normally done.  Normally, you would setup the Ubuntu server with Samba to serve the user's files. Samba can even be used as a NT4 style domain to centrally handle authentication, auditing, and authorization unless you are using Windows 7 Home Edition. The Ubuntu Server is a great place to start when setting up a samba server. You could set up Samba shares for each of your users and then they can save the files at their discretion.\nIf you are simply interested in a backup server, Bacula may be more what you are looking for. You could set up a Bacula Director on your Ubuntu server, and then configure Backula File on each of your clients.  Once again, the Ubuntu Server Guide can help you set this up.\nYou could share the home directories of all of the users on all of your windows machines and setup mount points on the Ubuntu Server and setup a cron job to back the files up to the server.  This will quickly get cumbersome as you add and subtract machines.  Let me know if this is really what you want to do and I will try to get you some instructions.\nAs for your second question, it depends entirely how you want to access your database.  If you want to access the server directly, you will need edit the /etc/mysql/my.cnf file and edit the bind-address = 192.168.0.2 parameter and change 192.168.0.2 to the ipv4 address of the server to listen over the network. Once again, this is documented in the Ubuntu Server Guide.\nYou could also use phpMyAdmin to access the database from any browser.  Once again, The Ubuntu Server Guide has instructions to set this up as well.\nGood Luck.\n", "Q: How to add some additional DNS search domains without ignoring the ones returned by DHCP?

After that, disconnect, connect and they'll be there.\n\nA: You will need to edit this file with your favorite editor:\nsudo vim /etc/dhcp/dhclient.conf\n\nOnce in file, you should see a commented line with the word supersede next to it:\n#supersede domain-name \"....\"\n\nUncomment that line, substitute the name supersede for append, then add the domain names you wish to search (follow the example below and leave a space after the first \"):\nappend domain-name \" ubuntu.com ubuntu.net test.ubunut.com\";\n\nSave the file and close.\nAll you need to do is restart your network connection.

It recommends the pcf font but when I install it, I do not see it in any applications (gvim, gnome-terminal, gnome-tweak-tool).  I tried the ttf as well but it still didn't work.  I haven't had problems with this font installing before.\n\nA: How are you attempting to install it? Did you double click the TTF, then \"Install Font\"? If so, did it seem to install without issue? Can you find the font in any of the folders where fonts are usually placed? (See \"Fonts\" on the Ubuntu Wiki). If you can't find the font there, try moving it there manually.\n\nA: You should have a look at this, it should work with other pcf fonts too.\nYou'll probably just have to open a Text Editor, put in he following content\n<?xml version=\"1.0\"?><!DOCTYPE fontconfig SYSTEM \"fonts.dtd\">\n<fontconfig>\n <selectfont>\n  <acceptfont>\n   <pattern>\n    <patelt name=\"family\"><string>Gohufont</string></patelt>\n   </pattern>\n  </acceptfont>\n </selectfont>\n</fontconfig>\n\nsave it as .fonts.conf in your home directory and run fc-cache -fv once.\nUpdate: For me, it only worked, when using fc-cache -fv with sudo.\n", "Q: Does the HUD work in Lubuntu?

I learned about the HUD from the notes about the most recent Ubuntu patch, which I think was \"Precise Pangolin\".  \nThat page has a small section about the HUD, but I couldn't find any links to talk about it more in depth.  The patch notes indicated that it should have been installed automatically, and I was wondering if there are any known reasons it might not be working.  I have looked through the existing questions and could not find a similar question.  \nMy only thought were that I run Lubuntu, and that I have no idea what Unity is.  Please advise.  \n\nA: HUD is currently available for unity only ,if you are using Lubuntu 12.04 you can enjoy features of HUD by installing unity inside Lubuntu \nLinked questions \n\n\n*\n\n*Is there a way to install Unity or Gnome Shell along with Lubuntu?\n\n*What is the Unity HUD and how can I install it on my system?\n\n*How do I use the HUD?\n\nA: Lubuntu uses the LXDE desktop environment. Ubuntu (The standard Ubuntu) uses what is called the Unity shell. There are a few different -buntu operating systems, such as Kubuntu, which uses the KDE environment, or Xubuntu, which uses the XFCE environment. \nThe HUD is exclusive to only the Unity shell. However, you can run this shell on Lubuntu by installing the shell. My personal bit of advice would be to download Ubuntu (standard Ubuntu, that is) and install it. However, if you would prefer having both the LXDE environment and the Unity shell, you can install Unity. If you would like to install it, there are plenty of guides here on AU.\nI have only used Ubuntu, and it came preinstalled with Unity, so I cannot tell you how exactly to install the Unity shell.\n", "Q: USB devices not regconized I am using Ubuntu 12.04.

Do all Linux programs have some kind of terminal command as well? Its seems many that I use do. And many seem like terminal commands can actually be more effective sometimes.\nI was just wondering if it was always programmed in to software to allow terminal commands for any given software. Like, could you pick up anything and use it fully in a terminal? (Like a messenger) I am getting the idea that it's up to the developer. If they want to incorperate the commands, they can, if not, they just have it as a GUI program. I just wasn't sure how it all worked.\n\nA: Apps can be at least executed from the terminal. However not all apps have special built in commands specific to the program. \nHowever on a similar note there are terminal only apps that can only be used in a terminal, \nAnd there are ones that you can open from a terminal, but only if you have a GUI installed.\n\nA: Although many programs have a CLI (command line interface) and can be used only from the terminal, not all work that way. It is really up to the developer of the program how they want it to work.\nTo see if a program has a commandline counterpart, you can either use man or --help. These are the most common ways to find out how to use it from a terminal (or what command line switches it accepts). i.e. if I wanted to find out more about the command cat, I would normally use \ncat --help \n\nThis usually provides a summary. man (short for manual pages, a central document store Linux uses for program documentation) is usually more in depth, in case --help doesn't provide the details you need. \nman cat\n\nMany times typing a command with no arguments will also bring up a summary help list, just like --help.\n", "Q: Speakers are not working after upgrading to 12.04 The day before yesterday I upgraded my OS from Ubuntu 11.10 to 12.04.\nAnd I was able to hear sound from my \"DELL VOSTRO - 3400\" Laptop for 24 hours only.\nBut after that sound is coming through the headset only, not through speakers.\nI searched for solution and followed the instruction given in the Sound troubleshooting help page.\nI have run the following commands:\nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:ubuntu-audio-dev/ppa\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get dist-upgrade\nsudo apt-get install linux-sound-base alsa-base alsa-utils gdm ubuntu-desktop  linux-image-`uname -r` libasound2\nsudo apt-get -y --reinstall install linux-sound-base alsa-base alsa-utils gdm ubuntu-desktop  linux-image-`uname -r` libasound2; killall pulseaudio\nrm -r ~/.pulse*\nsudo usermod -aG `cat /etc/group |\n  grep -e '^pulse:' -e '^audio:' -e '^pulse-access:' -e '^pulse-rt:' -e '^video:' |\n  awk -F: '{print $1}' | tr '\\n' ',' | sed 's:,$::g'` `whoami`\n\nwget -O alsa-info.sh http://www.alsa-project.org/alsa-info.sh && chmod +x ./alsa-info.sh && ./alsa-info.sh\n\nbash alsa-info.sh --stdout \n# resulted in different driver version: 1.0.24 (which actually should be 1.0.25)\n\nsudo apt-add-repository ppa:ubuntu-audio-dev/alsa-daily;sudo apt-get update;sudo apt-get install alsa-hda-dkms.\n\ncat /proc/asound/{version,cards,devices,hwdep,pcm,seq/clients}\nsudo rm /etc/asound.conf\nsudo rm -r ~/.pulse ~/.asound*\nsudo rm ~/.pulse-cookie\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get install aptitude\nsudo aptitude install paman gnome-alsamixer libasound2-plugins padevchooser libsdl1.2debian-pulseaudio\nsudo lshw -short\nls -lart /dev/snd\ncat /dev/sndstat\nlspci -nn\nlsusb\nsudo which alsactl\nsudo fuser -v /dev/dsp /dev/snd/*\ndpkg -S bin/slmodemd\ndmesg | egrep 'EMU|probe|emu|ALSA|alsa|ac97|udi|snd|ound|irmware'\nsudo /etc/init.d/sl-modem-daemon status\nsudo grep model /etc/modprobe.d/*\nsudo dmidecode|egrep 'anufact|roduct|erial|elease'\nlsmod | egrep 'snd|usb|midi|udio'\naplay -l\nsudo alsa force-reload\nsudo lshw -C sound\n\nThen I rebooted the system.

Mostly it happens with wine games. I play a lot of adventure games and I try to play ags games a good amount because there are a lot of them and they work great under wine. \nWhen I play games the unity icon bar and universal toolbar show through. Sometimes on native games but always on wine games. Is there anyone else this happens to and is there a way to fix this?\n[edit]\nFor some reason the site won't let me comment??? \nYes sorry, it's when I try to fullscreen the game.\n\nA: If you are having the same issue I have, and it sounds like you do, try unchecking Allow the window manager to control the windows in the Graphics section of winecfg. Works for me, no Dash or titlebar in fullscreen.\n\nA: I have this problem with some games using WINE(actually Crossovers version) from what I have been able to gather WINE and Compiz can have some issues playing well together.  Some games work fine others will show the top bar and launcher. If I remember right this usually results from poor programming in the Windows program you are trying to run(I could be wrong on that, I am going entirely from memory here)\nI have no problem with these same games if I log into Unity 2D which doesn't use Compiz. I wish I could give you the links I found about this but I don't remember where they were.\nAs far as the native Linux games, I don't have any games that I noticed having this problem, if I use the fullscreen option the native ones I have all cover the whole screen.\n\nA: The solution of pgschk works great, but has one major problem: You cannot move the mouse outside and work outside of wine. For example, if a wine application is opened which doesn't allow to control the window, if you click in firefox search, you cannot type with your keyboard.\nBut there is also another solution, which is more general, as it works not only for wine, but also for other applications (as for example some java apps) which need fullscreen: Enable 'legacy fullscreen' in compizconfig-settings-manager.\nSteps:\n\n\n*\n\n*Install the compizconfig-settings-manager, if not already installed\n$sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install compizconfig-settings-manager\n\n\n*Open the compizconfig-settings-manager (can also be found in the unity lens by searching for 'compiz')\n$ccsm\n\n\n*Click on the tab 'Advanced Search', which can be found below 'Categories' and 'Settings'\n\n*A list of Plugins will be shown. Select 'Workarounds'\n\n*Enable 'Legacy Fullscreen Support' (currently the second item in the list)\n\n*Restart your application in fullscreen and enjoy a screen without the unity bars :-)\n\nA: Then I guess you have two options: switch between window/fullscreen modes in your games and if possible set your native desktop resolution, this should hide all unity/gnome panels.\nThe other option would be to check 'emulate desktop' option in winecfg and set it to you native desktop resolution.\n\nA: I had the same problem running full screen games on Wine. I solved this by installing the openbox.\n\n\n*\n\n*Open terminal.\n\n*type: sudo apt-get install -y openbox and press Enter\n\n*Wait for the installation to finish.\n\n*Restart the system and in the login screen select openbox as desktop\n\n\nHowever it is necessary to start games from terminal.\n", "Q: How do I get a Brother dcp8070d printer working? I installed ubuntu 12.04. I downloaded and installed the drivers from the Brother solutions, but the printer does not receive data for printing.\nThe model of the Brother laser printer is dcp8070d.\nAnyone know a solution to this?\n\nA: I had a similar problem. There's actually a bundle you can get from the software manager. I forget it's exact name, but it seemed obvious to me. Look for Brother Printer. I'd know for sure if I was at home, but I'm not. I'll reply later if you don't find it.\n\nA: When you use the drivers from the Brother solutions, make sure that before installing those drivers, the printer is deleted. When the drivers are already installed, then remove them in Synaptic and delete the printer (In Unity: Gear icon at the upper right of the screen > Printers). After deleting the printer you can install the drivers again (lpr and cupswrapper) and the printer should work now.\n", "Q: Can not get passed the login screen I have the same issue as others (see Login returns to login screen [closed]).\nWhen I arrived at the login screen, I enter my password, the screen goes black for one second, displaying some text, and then it returns me to a fresh login screen.\nI can go to a console alt+f1 and login into my account on the command line.\nIt is a fairly fresh install of ubuntu 12.04 64 bit, plenty of room left on the home dir.

I've migrated around 300 users from a Fedora server to Ubuntu. I copied over all the relevant entries in /etc/passwd, /etc/shadow, /etc/group, and /etc/gshadow. One thing that was a bit concerning is that Ubuntu starts the uid's at 1000 while Fedora at 500. I saw that I can adjust that starting number, but will that really cause any issues if I just leave it?\nNone of the users I copied over had conflicting uid's or gid's with what was already on the Ubuntu server.\nI'm wondering if there is anything else I should look out for here. Maybe something that useradd does that I haven't taken into account?\n\nA: Didn't end up running into any issues during the migration. Just had to migrate the user entries in those files over. The password encryption was different, but ubuntu accounts for that when validating a password\n", "Q: How to debug Unity? (It works from live CD, but it doesn't work after update...) I've tested Ubuntu 12.04 from live usb before executing the automagic update (from 11.10 to 12.04) and everything was fine. Then, after updating, I couldn't even get Unity 2D to work. I've installed Gnome packages, so I can use Gnome classic (only the \"with no effects\" option works).\nDoes any one know how to debug Ubuntu/Unity to try to get it working? (Or I'll need to do a fresh install...)\n\nA: I've found out the solution. It is related to a NVIDIA's driver problem. \nLooking for messages in /var/log/syslog, I've discovered an error message from which I've taken the main words:\nsegfault error 4 in libc-2.15.so compiz\nA search on Google and I've found this post:\nCompiz crashes with SIGSEGV after upgrade to 12.04\nhttp://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=1966002&page=2\nSo, the problem is related to NVIDIAS's proprietary drivers. (There are two options from Additional Drivers, none of them works...) Disabling them brings me back the normal Unity, which unfortunately runs slowly, for obvious reasons. That's why I don't get this problem when I use the live usb: the proprietary drivers are not enabled by default.\nNow, we've got to wait NVIDIA fix this issue...\n\nA: If it were me, I'd do a clean install (but then this is what I actually did after a lot of work).

The person shall not have the possibility to unlock a Launcher-Icon by means of \"Unlock from launcher\" in the Quicklist (in former Ubuntu versions it was named uncheck \"Keep in Launcher\").\nIs it possible to remove or disable (greyed out) \"Unlock from launcher\" in the Quicklist of a Launcher-Icon?\n\n\nA: It seems there exists no way to remove or disable “Unlock from launcher” in the Quicklist of a Launcher-Icon. \nBut I found a workaround that saves the current order of the icons in the Launcher and - in the case that an icon was mistakenly removed from the Launcher - restores the order after every start, reboot or login.\nStep 1: Save the current order of the icons in the Launcher: Start Terminal (Ctrl+Alt+T) and enter the command gsettings get com.canonical.Unity.Launcher favorites > starter.icons (this will save the order in the file starter.icons in your home-directory).\nStep 2: Create a script in your home-directory by means of the command gedit ~/starter.icons_restore.sh and type the following text:\n#!/bin/bash\ngsettings set com.canonical.Unity.Launcher favorites \"$(cat starter.icons)\"\n\nSave the file and close Gedit.\nStep 3: Make the file executable by means of the command chmod +x ~/starter.icons_restore.sh\nStep 4: Make a new entry in the Startup Applications: Klick on the wheel in the top-right corner and chose Startup Applications... > Press Add > Name: Restore Launcher-Icons > Command: /home/<YourUsername>/starter.icons_restore.sh\nFrom now on after every start, reboot or login, the order of the icons in the launcher will be restored according the information in the file ~/starter.icons.\nP.S: Instead of Step 4 you can also create a Desktop-Starter with the command /home/<YourUsername>/starter.icons_restore.sh\nPP.S: Good news: In the case you have manually edited the quicklist of a Launcher-Icon, the amendments will be preserved even if the icon is (mistakenly) removed. That means, after restoring, the quicklist still contains all amendments.\n", "Q: AVConv X11Grab Issues: Unable to find a suitable output format for 'pulse' I am running Ubuntu 12.04 LTS 64-Bit, and I am attempting to use avconv to record the primary display connected to my computer (resolution of 1920x1080) using x11grab at 30 frames per second, along with audio from the default audio device connected to my computer through pulse.\nHowever, when I run the command:\navconv -f x11grab -s hd1080 -r 30 -i :0.0 pulse -i default recording.ogv\nthe terminal prints out the error:\nUnable to find a suitable output format for 'pulse'.\nWhat is causing this error message to be displayed?\n\nA: avconv is assuming that your output is named \"pulse\", so you need to add some additional options to indicate that it is an input. I use ffmpeg from the FFmpeg project and not avconv from the fork so I'll use ffmpeg for my examples.\nffmpeg -f x11grab -s hd1080 -r 30 -i :0.0 -f pulse -i default recording.ogv\n\nUnfortunately this won't work with avconv from the repository because it was not compiled with --enable-libpulse as far as I know. So instead you can try:\nffmpeg -f x11grab -s hd1080 -r 30 -i :0.0 -f alsa -i pulse recording.ogv\n\nIf you find that you need to use -f pulse then you will have to compile. See How To Compile FFmpeg and x264 on Ubuntu for a complete guide. You will need to additionally add libpulse-dev as a dependency and --enable-libpulse to the configure line. Also see HOWTO: Proper Screencasting on Linux for some good x11grab examples.

When it's executed from rc.local, which is executed from init, the current directory is the root directory /.\nAdd cd /direc/tory/ to your script. By the way, note that it's #!/bin/sh (#!bin/sh happens to work here only because you're executing your script from the root directory; it's a very bad idea to rely on this.)\n#!/bin/sh\nset -e\ncd /direc/tory\nwget \"http://somesite.org/someJava.jar\" -O someJavaFile.jar\njava -d64 -Xincgc -Xmx512M -jar someJavaFile.jar\n\nI also added set -e in the script.

So looks like you should be careful.    \n\nA: I was getting this error on ubuntu 12.04 both during upgrade-grub and briefly upon booting the PC but it was due to a misconfiguration on my side:\nI had two partitions on two disks paired with mdadm using RAID1.

Or maybe allowing me to easily \"temporarily switch back to HDD\" when eventually needed to install/remove new software or updates?\nAny approach is welcome, ready-to-use commands will be highly regarded.\nThanks!\n\nA: This is possible, but pointless. The kernel keeps a cache of data from the disk in RAM. The data that you used most recently is kept in RAM. You will naturally end up with the parts of /usr that you use often in RAM, and the parts you don't use won't be taking up any RAM.\nIf you want better reaction time when you start an application, you can seed the cache. A file is loaded into memory the first time you use it, and remains there until the memory is reused for something else. You can force a file to be loaded:\ncat /path/to/file >/dev/null\n\nFor example, to preload all executables and libraries into RAM:\ncat /bin/* /lib/* /usr/bin/* /usr/lib/* >/dev/null\n\nThis can take a while to complete, so you should do it in the background. You can put the following command in /etc/rc.local:\nionice -c 3 cat /bin/* /lib/* /usr/bin/* /usr/lib/* >/dev/null &\n\nTo also load all libraries in subdirectories of /usr/lib* it could be useful to run find:\nionice -c 3 find /bin /usr/bin /usr/lib* -type f -exec ionice -c 3 cat '{}' ';' > /dev/null &\n\n\nA: ionice -c 3 cat /bin/* /lib/* /usr/bin/* /usr/lib/* >/dev/null &\n\nWon't run, because there are a lot of directories within the libs.\ntry find:\nionice -c 3 find /bin /usr/bin /usr/lib* -type f -exec cat '{}' ';' > /dev/null &\n\nEverything it produces goes to /dev/null so nothing will annoy you.\nI think both ionice are required because find executes the commands in a own process. Please correct me if I'm wrong. (Looks like I were wrong.)\nThis line in rc.local should do the trick to the already chosen answer.\n[edit] removed second \"ionice\" as suggested in the comment.\n", "Q: How can I restart unity after I resume from suspend? This may sound like a stupid idea but I like to have a transparent top-panel which can be configured in Compiz Config Settings Manager, but when I resume from a suspend it's no longer transparent and gives a graphical glitch when invoking the dash. This goes away if I restart Unity by running the command \"unity\". So I was wondering if it was possible to achieve this? I tried setting a script in /etc/pm/sleep.d/ as stated in how to execute a command after resume from suspend? but it didn't work, I guess it is run before I get to log in again and Unity resumes.\nIs there any way to achieve what I want or should I just give up?\n\nA: Go to System Settings > Keyboard > Shortcuts > Custom Shortcuts\nand create a new one:\n\nthen set an easy keyboard shortcut like Alt+R to easily run a quick Unity restart after suspending.\nI do not suffer your bug but I need to run this command on every new session 'cos unity doesn't remember edge bindings on new sessions.\n\nA: Directly from the manual for  systemd-suspend.service:\nImmediately before entering system suspend and/or hibernation systemd-suspend.service (and the other mentioned units, respectively) will run all executables in /usr/lib/systemd/system-sleep/ and pass two arguments to them. The first argument will be \"pre\", the second either \"suspend\", \"hibernate\", or \"hybrid-sleep\" depending on the chosen action. Immediately after leaving system suspend and/or hibernation the same executables are run, but the first argument is now \"post\". All executables in this directory are executed in parallel, and execution of the action is not continued until all executables have finished.\nI did some testing, and found that if you put a script (marked executable by all, which be achieved with chmod a+x) in /lib/systemd/system-sleep, without the /usr, it will be executed as mentioned.\nHowever, there is one drawback which is what makes you think it isn't working: the environment is different. Graphical commands do not work. There is probably a way around this, but by default, unity --replace will fail because it can't connect to the X server (and so no commands that don't work if you press CTRL-ALT-F1 and go into an actual console without tampering will function).\nOkay, I just paused my typing to do some research: after looking at the basic chroot wiki (because I've had the same problem in chroots), I found that if you manually call xhost + before suspending, graphical commands (in my case zenity --info --text \"1:$1 2:$1\") function properly. However, you can't call xhost + from the script. What you can do is add a program to the \"startup applications\" to automatically call xhost + when you log in (add it there and not to .bashrc because if added to .bashrc it will run every time you open a terminal emulator). It might be different on Unity, but on Ubuntu MATE I can go to System → Preferences → Personal → Startup Applications and click Add to do this.\nThen, create a file /lib/systemd/system-sleep/restart-unity with the following contents:\n#!/bin/bash\nexport DISPLAY=:0\nif [[ \"$1\" == \"post\" && \"$2\" == \"suspend\" ]]\nthen\n    sleep 5\n    unity --replace\nfi\n\nand run sudo chmod a+x /lib/systemd/system-sleep/restart-unity (make sure the file is owned by root and only writable by root).\nNote that it must use bash. This is because of the \"if\" statement. When I tried the statement manually in sh, I got various errors from the && part.\nThe sleep is there because without it, unity --replace will fail to connect to the X server (or so it seems).\nBased on my own tests on Zesty, this should work.\nI just spent 15 minutes trying to figure out why it wasn't working only to realize I'd forgotten the export DISPLAY=:0 line.\n\nA: These seem useful:\n\n\n*\n\n*via askubuntu.com\n\n*via ubuntuforums.org.\n\n\nIs this the glitch you're seeing?\n\n", "Q: Why does groupmod  show me my folders and not my groups? I was trying to solve Virtualbox's USB problem by adding my username to the vboxusers group, but when I tried to see if the group existed by using groupmod TAB TAB all I got was what appears to be my home directory.\nWhy is that? What can I do to see the groups on my system?\n\nA: If you are using bash and the default bash-completion rules do not autocomplete groups for these commands, you can use something like the following (either by running once on the terminal or permenently by including it in ~/.bash_profile or ~/.bashrc.\ncomplete -g groupmod groupdel newgrp\n\nAnother way to see all of the groups is to look in the /etc/group file. Also, the \"groups\" command will allow you to see which groups you are a member of (and which groups other users are members of).\n", "Q: How should one set the grub-pc package's \"install_devices\" debconf setting? Many times the value of the \"install_devices\" debconf setting in the grub-pc package is wrong for various reasons. Sometimes it's because Ubuntu's installer selected a different install device than the BIOS boots from, sometimes it's because the user manually selected that grub's boot sector should be installed to a partition (which is wrong, it should always go in the MBR), etc.\nWhat is the officially supported way to change this debconf setting, preferably showing the user the helpful selection screen that used be given by sudo dpkg-reconfigure grub-pc (but which is no longer shown by this command in Ubuntu 12.04)?\n\nA: sudo dpkg-reconfigure grub-pc is the officially-supported way, and it still works fine for me.

BTW, I don't have a \"nautilus.desktop\" under /usr/share/applications. The closest filename I have is \"Nautilus-Actions Configuration Tool\". Not critical but any ideas?   \n\nA: Icons and themes are stored in the same format using the same file names for the components.

I have an ODBII USB cable for vehicle diagnostics, unfortunately I haven't been able to get it working on Ubuntu 12.04. The closest I've come is using the VAG-COM software with wine, using the ln -s /dev/ttyUSB0 ~/.wine/dosdevices/com1 trick and running stty -F /dev/ttyUSB0 speed 9600 repeatedly. It will connect and show the vehicle is OBDII, but none of the useful features seem to be working. I tried:\n\n\n*\n\n*Scantool - says it's connecting to the /dev/device in terminal, but doesn't.\n\n*obdgpslogger - times out all the time.\n\n*pyobd - This seems to be the most up-to-date source I could find, I had to adjust the code a bit to work (see here for changes). Still, in obd_io.py interpret_result function, it says it's looking for 4 space separated numbers, where the usb-serial is receiving bogus code \"0100\" instead?\n\n*freediag - I tried compiling, sh ./configure ran fine. I had to change some executable bit to make it start to compile, but now running make gives error:\ndiag_general.c:52: undefined reference to diag_l0_config'\n diag_general.c:55: undefined reference todiag_l2_config'\n collect2: ld returned 1 exit status\n ...\nand fails.\nThe device shows up in lsusb as:\nID 0403:6001 Future Technology Devices International, Ltd FT232 USB-Serial (UART) IC\n\nIs the problem that these native tools don't expect a USB serial, or a serial of this type? Or are these apps too old to recognize OBD2 of this vehicle?\n\nA: \nReference Data 1.This cable can not work if your car uses a protocol ssystem like VPW,PWM or Can-bus\n\nThis is a direct copy/paste from the Amazon page for the cable you link to. It may be that the cable just doesn't work with your device, though I would think the programs should see a non-working cable attached.\nHave you also tried Freediag?\n\nA: Try these resources:\nUsing ScanTool(win) under Linux using Wine\nUbuntu Forums: OBDII Code Readers COM1 Port\n\nA: I downloaded freediag source from https://sourceforge.net/p/freediag/gitrepo/ci/master/tree/ and\nhad no problems compiling it on Ubuntu 20.04 and on Fedora 31.

Just as the question says, I need to install newer version of Ubuntu without messing up the older version. I have looked at the responses to similar questions but it isn't clear to me how to do so (some suggest dual boot using a second hdd and some suggest using virtualization -- both of these are not an option for me).\n\nA: You should get the option to install alongside, it will not try to use a second drive if one is not available, it will attempt to create a logical partition within the existing setup.\nYou back up your existing install and the either shrink existing partitions and use the Something Else option to manually set partitions or let the installer do so.\nIf you do that the NEW install will install grub and the OLD system will be available as boot entry.\n", "Q: Pushing forward-lookup zones to VPN clients' dnsmasq configuration Ubuntu 12.04 uses a nice little automagic dnsmasq configuration for handling name resolution across DNS connections so that name resolution happens properly.\nWhen I connect to my OpenVPN server at work (for which I am the administrator) the client recognizes the reverse lookup networks properly and puts lines for those into the dnsmasq config, but not the forward networks:\n/var/run/nm-dns-dnsmasq.conf:\nserver=/10.in-addr.arpa/192.168.0.5\nserver=/0.168.192.in-addr.arpa/192.168.0.5\nserver=192.168.1.3\n\nThe contents should be:\nserver=/workdomain.ca/192.168.0.5\nserver=/10.in-addr.arpa/192.168.0.5\nserver=/0.168.192.in-addr.arpa/192.168.0.5\nserver=192.168.1.3\n\nWhat do I need to change on my OpenVPN server (pfsense) to push one or more search domains to the VPN client?\n\nA: Hmm, my client doesn't recognize the domains correctly and just uses the one DNS server my VPN server pushses rather than only using my VPN DNS for VPN domains.  To answer your question though, look into using push \"dhcp-option DOMAIN example.com\"\n", "Q: Where is a list of special url types? I was looking in gconf-editor, and I say under url-handlers, all sorts of things before I thought had nothing to do with urls.

I had no idea that the internet could be so integrated into an operating system (while besides Google Chrome OS which is both an OS and a browser at the same time.) Does anyone know of a list of the various urls you can have. Is there such a thing as a url that executes any command at will! (Just imagine, no more just sending code to someone. You can send them a link to excute any command!)\n\nA: \nIs there such a thing as a url that executes any command at will! (Just imagine, no more just sending code to someone. You can send them a link to excute any command!)\n\nThere is no such \"default\" url-handler. You could make one, of course, but it would be an immense security risk. Think Windows, where if you click on the link in one spam email, your computer could be infected with viruses or malware!\n\"executing any command\" is even worse, say I sent you a hypothetical any-command-url called anycommand:#rm -rf ~/#, and you didn't know a lot about the command line or didn't notice, that would wipe out your entire home directory.\nAlways click on a url-handler with care :)\n", "Q: how to fix the installation of new linux kernel?

You will then be able to click the \"Save\" button.\n\nA: The question was asked almost 8 years ago, now Ubuntu 19 is available, but there is still a mess with VPN GUI in Linux world. I have recently tested different distributions, and here are the results.\nBelow are problems that you might experience:\n\n\n*\n\n*OpenVPN GUI doesn't let you create a connection without certificate even when you need only username/password authentication (GNOME Network Manager).\n\n*PPTP GUI doesn't have fields (!) for entering gateway address, username and password (GNOME Network Manager installed in Lubuntu).\n\n*PPTP connection can be created but doesn't work.\n\n*PPTP connection can be created, but doesn't work if started from tray icon, only works if started from Network Settings dialog box (Mint Cinnamon 19.3).\n\n*By default there is no GUI for managing VPN connections (Lubuntu).\n\n\nYou can, of course, like me, try adding different repos, play with different versions of those GUIs, debug connections, etc.\nI found that only in KDE VPN GUI is reliable. Connection manager in current MX Linux (19.1) works fine.\nBut in case you have GUI problem I suggest you go reliable way - create connection without GUI. This requires minimal time and is pretty simple. Example is taken from this manual.\nCreate connection file /etc/ppp/peers/your_connection_name, with this contents:\npty \"pptp your_vpn_hostname --nolaunchpppd --debug\"\nname your_username\npassword your_password\nremotename PPTP\nrequire-mppe-128\nrequire-mschap-v2\nrefuse-eap\nrefuse-pap\nrefuse-chap\nrefuse-mschap\nnoauth\ndebug\npersist\nmaxfail 0\ndefaultroute\nreplacedefaultroute\nusepeerdns\n\nYou might want to secure it with chmod as described in the article. To start connection use sudo pon your_connection_name, and sudo poff your_connection_name to stop.\nYou can check connection status with ip a, monitor connection progress with watch 'ip a | grep ppp', or check statistics with pppstats.\nYou might find some more complex and probably more correct ways of defining VPN connection without GUI, but this one is very simple and straightforward - just what typical GUI user is looking for.\n\nA: After running it on the terminal while trying to get Cisco OpenConnect working in Ubuntu 21.10 it showed error:\nCould not load editor VPN plugin for “org.freedesktop.NetworkManager.openconnect”\n\nand I managed to fix it by installing:\nsudo apt install network-manager-openconnect-gnome\n\nI had previously only installed network-manager-openconnect.\nWithout the -gnome package, the VPN tab was missing entirely, and I couldn't enter the mandatory \"Gateway\" field.\n", "Q: No sound on an iMac I have no sound on my imac, with 12.04 from a clean install from CD.

There was a similar issue I was able to correct in 10.04 by adding some blacklist drivers in /etc/modprob.d but the issue then only meant I could not connect to internet after waking. Now it causes everything to slow to unusable as it tries to connect even if I turn off wifi and I am forced to hard reboot the machine. As I am running Conky I can see the process eating up the CPU - it is something like kirqsofd or some such thing. I apologize I do not remember the exact name of the process but I'm sure that is close.\nI do not believe installing WICD is a solution as that also did not completely work in 10.04.

Are you able to select 'safe' mode in grub and do a sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get upgrade in a terminal. You can also try this when you drop to terminal by pressing ctrl+alt+f1 and log in there.\n\nA: Press Ctrl+Alt+F1 to switch to a text-based virtual console.\nHave your machine connected to the Internet via an Ethernet cable.\nLog in (you won't see anything happening on the screen as you type in your password, that's OK), and run these commands, by typing them in and pressing Enter:\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get -f install\nsudo apt-get -y upgrade\nsudo apt-get dist-upgrade\n\n\nA: As mentioned in my comment, I had exactly the same problem.

I have come across many, many questions regarding syncing contacts with Ubuntu One. Unfortunately this is not possible in 12.04. I even asked ubuntuone-support and recieved this:\n\nHI,\n  We are completely redoing contact sync. Contact sync, I'm afraid, will not be\n  available in Ubuntu 12.04. We are optimistically hoping for contact sync to be\n  back in 12.10.\n  The new service plans to be a great improvement. We do sincerely apologize\n  about any inconvenience.\n  Thanks, (ubuntuone-support@canonical.com)\n\nHowever, I was wondering if anyone knew if older distro versions were still able to sync - as it might be a good work around to install Ubuntu One on a 10.04 Live CD and then export the contacts as a .vcf after sync.\n\nA: I'm sorry, and I may be mistaken, but I don't believe that this feature is present on the Ubuntu One servers anymore, so just running an older release won't be helpful. They decided that the old approach wasn't workable.\nIn order to again provide the feature, both server and Ubuntu clients will have to implement the new approach. I think that's why they refer to 12.10. The servers will need to implement a database in the cloud, and the clients will need to communicate with it.\n", "Q: Can Synaptic sort packages by time? I know Software Center can do this (in the \"History\" section), but I've yet to find a filter/column in Synaptic that will sort the packages by the time they were installed/removed. I could really use this for, say, batch-removing stuff I recently installed but couldn't remember the name/dependencies.\nCan I set up a custom filter/column/property/whatever for this, or what? I get the feeling that, at the very least, you should be able to do this from the terminal. If not, how come Software Center is able to do this?\nSomething Like this:\n\n\nA: \nI get the feeling that, at the very least, you should be able to do this from the terminal.\n\nYes, that's fairly easy to do by looking at the timestamps in /var/lib/dpkg/info/. For example, \n\nls -lct /var/lib/dpkg/info |egrep -o \"May.*\\.\" |\n    cut -d. -f1 | uniq | more\n\n-lct sorts by ctime, \"May\" is the current (or recent) month you're looking for, cut simply removes the annoying period at the end, and uniq removes duplicates. This gives you something like:\n\n...\nMay 11 18:03 libcogl-pango0:amd64\nMay 11 18:03 libcogl9:amd64\nMay 11 18:03 libcaribou0:amd64\nMay 11 18:03 libcaribou-common\nMay 11 03:35 libcpufreq0\nMay 11 03:35 cpufrequtils\n...\n\nSuppose you want to batch-remove all the packages installed on May 11 at 18:03, you would do something like this:\n\napt-get remove `ls -lct /var/lib/dpkg/info | \negrep -o \"May.*18:03.*\\.\" | \ncut -d. -f1 | uniq | \ncut -d' ' -f4 | tr '\\n' ' '`\n\nwhere the 2nd cut simply selects the package names and tr converts the linebreaks to spaces to give you a list suitable for apt-get.\n", "Q: Kubuntu won't lock When I close the screen of my netbook in Kubuntu, it doesn't lock when I reopen, and when I press the lock button, nothing happens.

So when I try and load up ubuntu for the first time, (booting from the live CD) after some time the monitor just blanks off. The other system parts are still moving, but I cannot do anything at all, seeing as I have no way of seeing the screen. It goes in this order: Boot, BIOS message, Boot menu, select CD/DVD rom drive, a few commands which pass by too quickly to read, purple screen with two icons at the bottom which stays there for about 10-15 seconds, a blinking cursor, then the monitor just blanks out and I can't do anything at all. As I stated earlier everything else was running fine except the screen which rendered everything pretty much useless. Any ideas on how to get around this?\nEDIT:  For those wanting specs, here they are: my model is a HP pavillion g6 notebook, intel i5 2340m dual core processor (2.4GHZ) 6 GB ram, intel hd graphics 3000. 1366x768 display resolution. I'll try and get more specs next time I have it on. \n\nA: When you burnt the live CD there could have been an error in the burring process. If you still have the opportunity you should try to reburn the live CD on the lowest burn speed. I normally use a live USB just to make sure that there are no errors in the burn. Hope that this helpes.\n\nA: There are similar issues described elsewhere - often the problem seems to be related to the graphics card - \nWhy does my 12.04 Alternate CD boot to a blank screen with flashing cursor?\n", "Q: How to create more partitions? I currently have only one partition but want to create some more partitions. How can I partition my drive using Ubuntu?  \nAnd is data formatted from documents when we upgrade Ubuntu to new release?\n\nA: You cannot change your partition while you are using that partition. The best thing is to define your partitions before installing Ubuntu with the Live CD. \nIf while you are installing from the Live CD you select Something else as your choice on the Installation Type window, you can define the partitions as you please. \nYou will need to format one partition as /, create a swap partition (approx equal to your amount of RAM), and, if you do not want to lose documents etc.,  make a separate /home partition. (This also means these files are separate if you need to reinstall to the / partition or upgrade or try a different distro - /home does not need to be formatted1). \nThere are hundreds of how to's all over the internet on how to do this. \nFollowing is an example setup for multibooting and sharing between Windows and Linux on 300gb.\nsda1 = ntfs 50gb (Windows 7)\nsda2 = extended 250gb (for the following)\nsda3 = ext4 25gb  (/ for 10.04)\nsda4 = ext4 25gb (/ for 12.04)\nsda5 = ext4 100gb (/home shared between 10.04 and 12.04²\nsda6 = fat32 or ntfs 100gb for a shared drive between all 3 OS's\n\nAll that being said - and my preferred method - you can still use gparted from a Live CD and shrink and edit partitions with a risk of losing data. Plenty of tutorials out there on how to do that also - including some on YouTube.\n1 Some configuration files (ones that start with a ., for example .config) can botch a different install if you use the same username.\n2 (each Linux OS requires a different user name to avoid conflict.)\n", "Q: Lenovo u400, Ubuntu 12.04. Sudden reboots / power down I've recently bought a Lenovo u400 (http://www.lenovo.com/products/us/laptop/ideapad/u-series/u400/) and installed Ubuntu 12.04 on it.\nEverything works fine (I've installed the proprietary ATI drivers for switchable graphics) except that I get a random power down or reboot either while surfing the web or watching videos.\nMonitoring the temperature with sensors, the laptop never goes into any critical zone but still may power down or reboot once in a while. Is there any logs that I should check and any particular message I should take note of?\nEDIT: This happens to me as well. This also happens without proprietary drivers activated.\n\nA: I had the same problem with the U400. I didn't found any hints to solve this so I completely reinstalled Ubuntu. That seems to fixed it.\nI am interested if the Intel virtualization could be the reason. Do you have enabled it in the BIOS settings? At my first installation it was enabled. Now I've done a reinstallation with the Intel virtualization disabled and it runs without any reboots. Maybe it's just a hazard.\n", "Q: Shell script to read files and replace lines I need help creating a shell script to search .yml files in a specific folder for a line containing money: and then replacing that line with money: 1000\n\nA: You could try sed.

My netbook Acer AOD255 has three primary partitions in it by default - PQSERVICE/recovery (NTFS), Android x86 1.6 (FAT32), and the main WinXP Home SP3 (pre-installed, dual-booted with Android from inside WinXP). I was able to resize all three partitions to give 9GB of unallocated space for a future Ubuntu installation, which can already be booted from a pendrive. Here's my problems:\n1.) I don't know how to install Ubuntu on that 9GB space (even if I create an unformatted partition for it)\n2.) I currently have no means of reinstalling my XP, or backing-up any data (so I don't want to accidentally wipe out my whole HDD at all)\n3.) I want XP and Ubuntu to be dual-booted thru a boot manager like GRUB or something more practical (but google searches confuse me)\n4.) When I boot to try Ubuntu, GParted displays my whole drive as unallocated space. It also says \"can't have overlapping partitions\" or something.\n\nA: My advice to your case is for you to install Ubuntu with the Windows installer. You can see your disk partitions and tell the installer how much should he steal from the windows partition to create the Ubuntu partition.\nDownload the Windows installer for Ubuntu Desktop.\nBy the print-screen bellow, you can see that you can tell at the installer in which installation drive will the Ubuntu be installed, and how much space should be available for the new Ubuntu partition:\n\nPlease see the official step by step guide for detailed instructions.\n\nTo answer your question related to the bootloader, after the installation is concluded, you will have a boot manager that allows you to select the OS to boot in:\n\n\nA: don't make unallocated space, change it back as it was, just run Ubuntu installation CD and you will be prompted how much disk space you want to use for Ubuntu, and it will be automatically made for you\n", "Q: How to close filezilla via terminal I am working on server files temporarily through filezilla in ubuntu 11.10.

And can I migrate my settings easily? \n\nWill there be any problems or bugs if i install ubuntu on windows with the windows installer.If i install will i get the exact same ubuntu or will there be any thing missing.\nWill i get the exact power and performance of ubuntu?\n\nA: I am not 100% sure that I understand you question, but if you install Ubuntu you have Ubuntu. It does not truly matter how it is installed as along as the installation is successful. \nSo to answer you question no it does not matter.\n\nA: It does matter. If you install Ubuntu using Wubi you will have slower performance. Why is that so. Ubuntu is using ext4 format for your HDD and Windows is using NTFS. If you install Ubuntu using Wubi Ubuntu will use NTFS file system and it will little slower. But it's not a big deal\n\nA: There should be no problems though, but if you ask me I would always suggest you to make a fresh install by booting from the CD.\n\nA: *\n\n*Disk performance is slightly slower. You should not be able to notice any difference under normal circumstances. The problem becomes more evident if you have little memory and use swap a lot or if your windows partition is very fragmented. It should be still far faster than under a typical VM or LiveCD.\n\n*The filesystem is less reliable than in a real installation. This is because you have 2 filesystems nested within each other which makes it more vulnerable than ntfs or ext3 taken individually. This can be an issue if you hard reboot (unplugging the power). Hard reboots are never ever a good idea, but even less so in wubi. We have taken some measures to minimize the risk (and will add a couple of tricks to next build), so that hard reboots can be better tolerated, but the rule of thumb is: do not hard reboot. In linux there are alt+sysrq key combinations if you get stack for any reason. \n\n*Hibernation / Suspend does not work properly. We are looking into this with the help of some ubuntu kernel devs. Either we'll fix that or we will disable hibernation/suspend.\nA side issue is that with wubi people tend to allocate less disk space than they would with a normal installation (since they take it as a trial and then keep using it). Of course if the free space is over, it is going to create issues, but that is hardly our fault. We are looking into ways to expand virtual disks, but that would be a separate app anyway. That said in linux you can create a link from a folder within a real partition to a folder within a virtual disk, thus alleviating the pain.\nIn short: allocate enough space, do not hard reboot and do not suspend/hibernate. Other than that it should be the full monty: same speed (other than for #1), same hardware support/detection, same behaviour, same software. A small trade-off considering that we* provide what can possibly be considered the easiest OS installer ever created, whatever the OS.\nAs for long term use, I would consider wubi as a mid-term solution. You can use it happily for weeks and months, but because of the 3 issues above, if you find yourself using Ubuntu quite heavily, you might want to do a full installation later on. That said we have a tool to migrate virtual disks to a real partition (LVPM by tuxcantfly). So migration should be quite smooth (that should result in an installation which is 100% identical to a standard one while keeping your data and settings). \nIf you have a free partition or a spare hard disk and are confident about partitioning and ISO burning there is no much reason to use Wubi, just go straight for the full installation via live CD. But for people that do not know what a partition is, wubi is probably the best solution to date, particularly once tools such as LVPM reach final status. I hope that wubi will bring a small revolution to Linux installers and hence to Linux adoption, similar to what Knoppix/LiveCD did a few years ago', and I would not be too surprised to see Wubi clones implemented by other *nix distros in the near future.\n(found on http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=481219)\n", "Q: DVDs don't play after installing the restricted packages I've installed the Ubuntu restricted area packages tried several things but no DVD play.\nAUDIO CD works fine, I built this system especially for linux all new hardware.\ndvd drive worked fine in a windows system. could it be a hardware issue, perhaps the drive\nhaving no specific name brand such as sony or lite on?\n\nA: try installing libdvdcss\nOpen Terminal and paste this \nsudo -E wget --output-document=/etc/apt/sources.list.d/medibuntu.list http://www.medibuntu.org/sources.list.d/$(lsb_release -cs).list && sudo apt-get --quiet update && sudo apt-get --yes --quiet --allow-unauthenticated install medibuntu-keyring && sudo apt-get --quiet update\n\nand Enter \nthen \nsudo apt-get install app-install-data-medibuntu apport-hooks-medibuntu\n\nnow \nsudo apt-get install libdvdcss\n\nyou should no be able to play DVDs\nhope this helps\n\nA: The problem might also be that the DVD is encrypted.\nYou need the libdvdread4 package which should be installed in Ubuntu 12.04 but which must be configured to work.

If I stop SSH service on the Ubuntu machine and instead start one on the windows machine - it works like a charm.\nI do not use the Std port 22 but that shouldn't be an issue as far as I understand - sine it works on the same port on the win machine.\nSince my public IS isn't static I use a dynDNS service but as said earlier the same setup works from the win machine.\nThe router is located on 192.168.0.1 \nThe Ubuntu NICs has the following IP: eth2 192.168.0.100 , eth1 192.168.0.101 , eth0 192.168.0.102 and I have forwarded the \"outside\" request to 192.168.0.100\nIn regards for firewall settings on the Ubuntu machine I have disabled the ufw and the command ufw status give status: inactive.\nI don't now it this is relevant information but \nteh command iptables --list give:\nChain INPUT (policy ACCEPT)\ntarget     prot opt source               destination         \nChain FORWARD (policy ACCEPT)\ntarget     prot opt source               destination         \nChain OUTPUT (policy ACCEPT)\ntarget     prot opt source               destination\nI have tried to catch traffic with help of wireshark (a tool I'm not too used to use) and it seems as a few (3?) \"requests\" actually reaches the NIC but ... nothing happens. \nThe syslog does not show any entries during these attempts. \nPerhaps it could be some routing issues but I have reached my level of competence and are stuck ... all help and support to get this sorted out is much appreciated. \nI'm new to Linux so please do not assume I have a configuration that is correct - but as I wrote earlier - if the client that initiate SSH is on the LAN it all works.\nPS:I have also tried to get VPN (PPP) working from Internet with no success - once again VPN works on the windows machine ... so my best guess is that this is related to how the ubuntu machine handles (IP) traffic and not the TL-MR3420 router or other network issues.\n\nA: What's probably happening is that the SSH service isn't running on all of the network interfaces.

I have never installed a theme before but I have watched videos and know in general how it is done but one question still remains. \nAfter installing Mac OSX Lion theme (for example) can I easily and quickly switch back to my previous 12.04 settings? Then am I able to jump back and forth at a few clicks of the mouse?\nBasicly I am just wondering after everything is set up can I switch my computer from looking like OSX to 12.04 at my  leisure or do I always have you change all of my settings?\nThanks.\n\nA: If you've already downloaded the appropriate Mac OSX theme components (wallpapers, cursors, icons, window theme), it's easy enough to switch between themes using the gnome-tweak-tool.

How do I make Chromium on Kubuntu render Emoji Unicode characters ?\nLike these : ❤\n\nA: The Symbola font is part of the ttf-ancient-fonts package. You can install it by running this command in a terminal window:\nsudo apt-get install ttf-ancient-fonts\n\nSource\n\nA: ttf-ancient-fonts gets you Black & White emoji.\nFor color emoji, it's only working with Firefox right now. The current best solution is to use eosrei/emojione-color-font or eosrei/twemoji-color-font via the Launchpad PPA:\nsudo apt-add-repository ppa:eosrei/fonts\nsudo apt-get update\n# Choose one!\nsudo apt-get install fonts-emojione-svginot # emoji one style\n# Or\nsudo apt-get install fonts-twemoji-svginot # twitter style\n\nYou're gonna need to restart your browser to see the change.\nSee also the Emojione Picker for Ubuntu\n\n\nA: First, you need a font that contains those characters. According to support information at Fileformat.info, the only font that has them is Symbola, though it is possible that some less known fonts have them too. Symbola can be downloaded from http://www.fonts2u.com/search.html?q=symbola or http://users.teilar.gr/~g1951d/ (the latter is for the author’s site, hence preferable when it works).\nSecond, browsers have difficulties with special fonts. They are often unable to pick up special characters from various fonts. I’m afraid that if a page does not explicitly mention Symbola (as it really should in cases like this), the only thing you can do as a user is to make your browser use Symbola as the default font, at least temporarily (via the browser’s general settings).\n", "Q: Installing ubuntu 12.04 I have dual boot Vista and ubuntu 11.10\nInstalled Ubuntu 12.04 with Live CD\nA message: Download some applications install manually\nInstallation completed.

I used the boot layout leftover from Linux Mint 12 (which was working).\n\n*The installation finished with what seemed to be a success.\n\n*However, when rebooting, I get this error:\nGRUB: “invalid arch independent ELF magic” after install on SSD\n\n*Then I did grub-install and update-grub (I didn't install grub-efi, so maybe this is the problem?)\n\n*Then I got \"unknown filesystem error\" at the grub prompt.\n\n*Desperately, I gave /boot the bootable flag.  Then on a reboot,...  I got some strange screen with the letters PXE.  It flashed momentarily, too fast to read, and then the computer jumped to a screen which asked me from which drive was the boot desired to be.\nAs of now, I have no idea what I am doing.\n\nA: Ubuntu 12.04 officially supported UEFI, so don't need to configure anything manually. But unfortunately, when I manually partitioned and install Ubuntu (with Windows 7 on Lenovo V570) it only started Windows7. Then I created a separate partition and select \"Install Ubuntu alongside windows\" rather than manually partitioned. Now at startup grub boot menu appears to select Windows or Ubuntu. \n\nA: I just did a couple of dual-boot V570s, which was simpler with the LTS release than with the earlier 12.04 beta, for which there was a need to blacklist acer-wmi.\n\n\n*\n\n*Be sure to burn a complete set of recovery DVDs.\n\n*From the installation CD, partition as follows:\n\n\n*\n\n*delete the empty and unnecessary LENOVO partition,\n\n*allocate about half the drive as the extended sda5 (ext4), setting it up as /, and\n\n*reserving about 1 GB more than your memory for a swap area. So for 6 GB memory, the swap will be 7 GB.\n\n\n*The installation will almost certainly screw up booting. Just hit Lenovo's one-step recovery. If you have data or programs in W7, this is where you use the recovery DVDs,-- otherwise you'll get a completely clean W7 installation. Before exiting W7,insert the Ubuntu CD and reboot into the \"try without installing\" mode.\n\n*In the file menu, click on the the Ubuntu (sda5) file system to make sure it's mounted. Then in terminal:\nsudo su\nmkdir /mnt/root\nmount /dev/sda5 /mnt/root\ngrub-install--root-directory=/mnt/root /dev/sda\numount /mnt/root\nreboot\n\n\n*The first reboot will give you the classic grub dual boot menu. Updating gives the nicer-looking current one.\n\n*I prefer Evolution to Thunderbird (especially since migration of emails with complex directories is a pain), but unfortunately it doesn't provide a messaging indicator. To fix this, gedit a file named evolution with the contents evolution.desktop into /usr/share/indicators/messages/applications.\n\n*I also like the program Touchpad Indicator for giving several control options over the touchpad (such as disabling when a wireless mouse is installed). Again, no indicator.\nTo fix this, go to System Settings > Startup Applications Preferences > Add, and \nName: touchpad-indicator\nCommand: /usr/bin/touchpad-indicator\nComment: Starts Touchpad Indicator\n\n\n*I like to label the Windows drive as such.

But first, click on the sound icon at the top right, it looks like a speaker with sound coming out (might be right or left click).  Then open the sound settings and look under hardware to see if Ubuntu recognizes your sound card.  If nothing is there under hardware, you will need a driver.  If something is there, check the output tab to make sure the sound is not muted.\nFor more help, pls tell us which version of Ubuntu you are using and also more about your computer.

Thought that I would add some information regarding laptop touhpad issues.  I have a Samsung R530 laptop running Ubuntu 12.04.  There has always been issues with my touchpad; it would start by being erratic, then would move only small amounts at a time and occasionally it would correct, sometimes I would need a reboot.  Now since the upgrade things are getting rather strange! Initially the touchpad worked great, then it reverted back to its operation problems as with ubuntu 11.10; now the cursor randomly freezes and the only option is to reboot.  It seems that over time the problem is getting worse, is it possible that the problem could worsen over time? is there any hope of a fix? I also have a Compaq Presario running Ubuntu 12.04 with no cursor problems as yet, it has a wireless mouse attached.   \n\nA: Have you tried turning off the feature that attempts to disable your touchpad while you're typing?\n", "Q: Ripped mp3 files show wrong track lengths I have seen this problem both when using Banshee and Sound Juicer. I'm using Ubuntu 12.04 on a Thinkpad 14\". I'm not sure about the make of my internal CD drive, but would be glad to provide you with that information if someone tells me how to. I have not had access to an external CD drive so that I could tell if the problem is my internal CD drive.\nAnyway, the problem: The mp3 files I have ripped show wrong lengths. For example when I ripped Peacebone by Animal Collective, which's length is 5:13, the file was 25 minutes long, according to my phone and banshee. The players skip to the next song before playing the whole 25 minutes. However, I'm not comfortable not knowing if I'm listening to the whole thing or the real length of the song. \nThis far the problem has disappeared on a second rip, although the file lengths are still occasionally a few seconds longer than they're supposed to be.\n\nA: From my experience this problem occurs when ID3 tags are invalid. You could try to delete all ID3 tags from the given files and then rewrite them. I recommend mutagen for this, it's a metadata manipulation library with some useful utilites.\nFirst install mutagen\nsudo apt-get install python-mutagen\n\nNow go to a folder with some problematic MP3 file and run mid3v2 on it:\nmid3v2 --delete-all your_file.mp3\n\nThis will remove all metadata from a given file, which means no title, no artist, no album cover, but the file should display correct length.\nYou can repopulate metadata using e.g. Picard, which is available in Ubuntu as picard package.\nEdit: There's also MP3 Diags application which should be able to fix VBR headers and some other problems with MP3 files. It's available in Ubuntu as mp3diags (or from Ubuntu Software Center)\nAnother, more specific, solution is VBRFix – console version (without Qt GUI) is available in vbrfix package. If you want GUI, you'll probably have to compile it yourself.\n\nA: Starting around Ubuntu 12.04, when you rip CDs in Ubuntu using Rhythmbox or Sound Juicer the default settings will create VBR MP3s, but the VBR headers don't get added, so just about any program you open the MP3s with will show the incorrect track length, including the default music player (Rhythmbox) and the default file manager (Nautilus).\nThe easiest solution is to add the VBR header to the MP3s after ripping them:  \n\n\n*\n\n*Install vbrfix by running this command in a terminal:  \nsudo apt-get install vbrfix\n\n\n*Now CD to the folder where the mp3s are that you need to fix:  \ncd /path/to/mp3s\n\n\n*Run this command to add the VBR headers to the mp3s:  \nfind . -type f -iname '*.mp3' -exec vbrfix {} {} \\;\n\n\n*Vbrfix seems to leave behind a couple of temporary files, so clean them up:  \nrm vbrfix.log vbrfix.tmp\n\nAn alternative solution is to change the default preset so that the CDs are ripped as CBR instead of VBR MP3s. There's a pretty good explanation here: https://askubuntu.com/a/154933/18665\nA profile like this ought to do the trick (change the bit rate as desired):\n[mp3-cbr]\nname=lamemp3enc\ntarget=bitrate\nbitrate=192\ncbr=true\nencoding-engine-quality=high\nmono=false\n\nAs with any bug, if you're experiencing this problem I'd highly recommend you go to the bug report and mark that it affects you (near the top left), so that it gets more attention. The bug report is here: Rhythmbox does not add VBR headers when ripping CDs to MP3\n", "Q: Using the Installer and clicking Upgrade - Are they the same? I'm currently using 11.10.\nI have a downloaded copy of 12.04 on CD.\nQuestion: Is it the same if I hit the UPGRADE button on the update manager, or install 12.04 through the CD? Will I lose my work/settings/installed apps (LAMP, Lazarus, etc) by either method? I know if I boot from the CD and install, I'll most certainly lose everything... But my question is will this happen even if I run the CD while on Ubuntu? \nThanks!\n\nA: \nBut my question is will this happen even if I run the CD while on Ubuntu?\n\nYou should understand that the Ubuntu Live-CDs (which most people download) do NOT contain the .deb packages that are used for an upgrade; instead, they contain the entire filesystem in compressed form, so that it can be used both for the LiveCD, and to perform a new installation (the filesystem is simply copied to the hard disk in that case).\nIf you have decent internet access, it is HIGHLY recommended to go the upgrade route. If you don't, maybe you can get your hands on the alternate CD? That does have the regular deb packages/repository, and you could conceivably use apt-cdrom to add it to your /etc/apt/sources.list as a local repository and use it for the upgrade.\n", "Q: Which packages recommended 'Missing Recommends'?

My IP address has been banned from the Ubuntu forums for spam but I have no knowledge of the spam or what could be happening. I have been in touch with the admins there but they refuse to help basically saying \"We will un-ban you when you stop the spam.\" Since I don't know what is happening it feels to me like a security problem or maybe a virus on my Ubuntu machine is sending spam? I know people say that Ubuntu is virus proof but could this be an exception?\n\nA: It could be that someone else has got your account details and is posting spam using them from other computers. So I would try changing your password to exclude that possibility and see if that causes the spam to stop.\n\nA: I have done some further investigation and have been able to unblock the IP address you mentioned in your email - and have emailed you about this. You should be OK now, but we will need to monitor use of this IP address in case it is being spoofed by a persistent spambot.\n\nA: Router\nIf the problem is with your Ip. You could reset your router and get a new global Ip. that way you would get a new Ip that is not in use, and you wont spam. If now there isn't something wrong with your computer. \n\n\n*\n\n*Check your network, how many clients are connected? \n\n*It could be that your wireless isn't secure enough, change the password, change the name and change the encryption type. \n\n*Do you know who ownes the clients on your network?\n\n\nNot a Virus \nit's not a virus. a virus is a program that installs on your computer by itself, it's really unlikely that it's a virus. \nTrojan?\nBut it could be a trojan. A program that you have installed and isn't what you think it is. \nthis is ubuntu.com's offical antivirus page. I hope you find what you are looking for there. I still think a fresh install is the best way to go. \n\nA: This has been explained to you in multiple emails.\nWe do not blacklist IP addresses for single spam posts. We block IP addresses for sustained spam over days or more often weeks.\nIf we unblock your IP, you will post once or twice on the forums, then the spam will start, and we will then have to block the IP again.\nSo the solution is to either :\n\n\n*\n\n*Ask you to stop spamming the forums. You say you are not and I believe you. So ...\n\n*You will have to wait until the party or parties responsible stop spamming the forums. We review banned IP addresses from time to time and will reverse the ban when the spam stops.\nIn the mean time you will have to use other support methods such as Ask Ubuntu, irc, or launchpad.\nWhy are you re-installing your OS ? I never advised that. How does that stop some third party from spamming the forums from your IP ?\nYou can lodge a complaint with your IP provider or you can contact the local authorities, but often they are disinterested. If you do identify the spammer, and get them to stop, I will unban your IP. Otherwise we wait them out. They usually go away eventually .... Sometimes they come back and are re-banned. In the case of your IP, with the previous history, it is likely to remain banned for some time.\nWe are blocking an 'block' of IPs - so in other words, because of the way your ISP gives you an IP address, someone on your block of IPs (aka, someone in your internet phone number area code) is spamming and so it's easier for us to block the entire block instead of just the specific spammer IP, since it changes every day.\nPossibilities: \n\n\n*\n\n*Your WiFi is not secure.\n\n*Your ISP is cycling IPs in a really odd fashion.\n\nA: It's far more likely that your account has been hacked in a manner which is nothing to do with your computer.

Additionally, I've tried several different servers in Europe and the U.S. as well as the \"main server\" (wherever that is) and they all yield the same result: I can't connect to any software sources.\nAdditionally, I'm fairly certain the problem stems from the upgrade from 11.10->12.04 I performed this morning, as updates worked immediately before.\nUpdates from the Update Manager worked fine and I could download some things (mutter) from the Software Center without incident, which makes me think I can connect to some subset of the Ubuntu servers (however, several other Ubuntu servers--like extras--and some canonical servers are listed as 'unable to connect').\nHere is the output from sudo apt-get update:\nsudo apt-get update\nIgn http://ftp.u-picardie.fr precise InRelease\nIgn http://archive.canonical.com precise InRelease                                                                        \nIgn http://ftp.u-picardie.fr precise-updates InRelease                                                                    \nIgn http://ftp.u-picardie.fr precise-backports InRelease                                                                  \nErr http://ftp.u-picardie.fr precise-security InRelease                                                                    \n\nErr http://ftp.u-picardie.fr precise Release.gpg                                                                           \n  Unable to connect to ftp.u-picardie.fr:http:\nErr http://ftp.u-picardie.fr precise-updates Release.gpg                                                                  \n  Unable to connect to ftp.u-picardie.fr:http:\nErr http://ftp.u-picardie.fr precise-backports Release.gpg                                                                \n  Unable to connect to ftp.u-picardie.fr:http:\nErr http://ftp.u-picardie.fr precise-security Release.gpg                                                                 \n  Unable to connect to ftp.u-picardie.fr:http:\nHit http://archive.canonical.com precise Release.gpg                                                                      \nHit http://archive.canonical.com precise Release                                                                          \nHit http://archive.canonical.com precise/partner i386 Packages                                                              \nIgn http://archive.canonical.com precise/partner TranslationIndex                                    \nIgn http://dl.google.com stable InRelease                                                            \nIgn http://dl.google.com stable InRelease                                                    \nErr http://archive.canonical.com precise/partner Translation-en_US                           \n  Unable to connect to archive.canonical.com:http: [IP: 91.189.92.150 80]\nErr http://archive.canonical.com precise/partner Translation-en                              \n  Unable to connect to archive.canonical.com:http: [IP: 91.189.92.150 80]\nIgn http://extras.ubuntu.com precise InRelease                                               \nGet:1 http://dl.google.com stable Release.gpg [198 B]                                        \nErr http://extras.ubuntu.com precise Release.gpg                                      \n  Could not connect to extras.ubuntu.com:80 (91.189.88.33). -

Evidently apt can't handle very many software sources, so I was able to solve my problem by deselecting all except the one I needed to access. This would be a real pain to do frequently, but it's better than nothing. From the site:\n\nFrom the \"Other Software\" tab, disable all PPA repositories, leaving only the official Ubuntu repositories active. Enabling too many PPA repositories (which are non-official) can cause your package manager to become unstable. \n\n\nA: Add the line nameserver 8.8.8.8 to your /etc/resolv.conf.\nThis sets alternate DNS servers (the public DNS servers run by Google), in case it's a DNS problem. It's similar, though not identical, to this other answer (which was posted later, and gives a different method for essentially the same reconfiguration).\n\nA: This is caused by some proxy packages like anon_proxy, it passes all of HTTP connections through a local proxy using an environment variable.\nSo, to change this edit /etc/environment and comment out HTTP_PROXY and http_proxy in last two lines.\n\nA: Yes, the name server update does work and if it does work then you've probably updated your IP settings to be static and your server can no longer resolve URLs.  \nTry the above and if it works, reboot.  If it fails after rebooting, then do this:\nEdit the template file for the resolv.conf. Ubuntu server rebuilds this every boot.\nsudo vi /etc/resolvconf/resolv.conf.d/tail\n\n#add just these two lines >>\nnameserver 8.8.8.8\nnameserver 8.8.4.4  \n\nThen save the file and restart the service:\nsudo /etc/init.d/resolvconf restart\n\n8.8.8.8 and 8.8.4.4 are just Google's Name Servers.  You should be able to add in your own ISP's if you want.  If you don't like vi, use nano or vim.\nI figured it out reading this article. So credit to them for the tip.\n\nA: I have got the same issue, and I was keep checking /etc/apt/sources.list with no luck finding the problematic source. It turns out there is a /etc/apt/sources.list.d directory with bunch of files I have added through the past. I have found the invalid file in that directory, and removed it. \nThe apt-get update and upgrade is working perfect now. \n\nA: Try sudo ldconfig /usr/bin/gpg. See: https://unix.stackexchange.com/a/677711/114401\nIt worked for me. sudo apt update now works again.\n", "Q: Persistant File System vs Installation onto USB stick I want to install Ubuntu to a 4Gb USB stick, so that I can boot it on other computers, but I heard that a persistent file system never deletes data and so just fills up. This would be a problem as I like to keep Ubuntu up to date, and downloading 100Mb worth of upgrades on a regular basis would fill up the drive quite fast if they never truly overwrote old ones.\nSo can someone please tell me if this is true and, also, if there are any advantages to using a persistent file system over just installing Ubuntu to the drive.\nIn addition, would it be possible to install the Ubuntu installer onto a normal installation of Ubuntu - ie, if I used the installer to install to the live stick, would I be able to get the installer back on the USB stick to install it on further machines? It's not really an issue if I can't, but I am curious. Thank you.\n\nA: I think the persistent file system only doesn't delete data that already exists in the SquashFS file, ie. what's already there by default. So if you try to uninstall, say, Firefox, then you won't get space. However, if you install a new program, like Pidgin, and then later uninstall Pidgin, then you will free up your space. \nSo if you're only going to install and not going to remove what you've already installed, then persistence is the best option is to use a persistent file system, because if you do a full install then it'll take up more space.\nFull install takes up more space because when you do an install then it uncompresses what was in the (highly compressed) SquashFS filesystem.\nIf there are some programs in the default ISO that you are not going to use, then I suggest you use UCK (Ubuntu Customization Kit), which lets you customize the Ubuntu ISO, to remove those programs and maybe install/update any programs you want to use. That way all those changes will be in the SquashFS filesystem as well, so everything will be compressed and you'll have more free space left at the end of it. \nThis is what I have been doing for some time now and it's been working nicely.\n\nA: The advantage of having Ubuntu installed in a pen drive is that you can always carry your OS & files with you no matter where you go and can use it in every machine. The disadvantage is, as you already said, a pen drive have a relatively small capacity and will fill up pretty easily.\nIf you want that kind of portability the pen drive gives to you, I suggest you consider buying a pen drive with more capacity (I saw there are some up to 64gb!). Some guys were discussing the same question in here: FULL install Ubuntu on 4GB USB drive\nI didn't understand what you meant with the last question, but you can partition your external disc (pen drive) and in the first partition install the installer and in the second one the actual installation of Ubuntu. Personally I haven't tried this, but I think this thread will help you.\nHow do I install Ubuntu to a USB key?

This bug prevents me from using LibreOffice.\n\nA: The LibreOffice bug report hasn't received any official updates for a while so I've done some tinkering.  It turns out that uninstalling \"libreoffice-gtk\" fixes the menu problem for me (but LibreOffice looks rather ugly without GTK+ integration so this should be viewed as an ugly hack rather than a satisfactory fix... but at least it works)\n\nA: There are two possible workarounds:\n\n\n*\n\n*With the menu Slideshow->Slideshow Settings, you can open a dialog which allows you to select the monitor manually at the bottom\n\n*Since 3.5 the presenter-console has a \"exchange screens\" quick-button: http://wiki.documentfoundation.org/ReleaseNotes/3.5 To use presenter-console you need to: apt-get install libreoffice-presenter-console\n\n\nA: Seems that this issue has been now fixed in LO 3.5.5 installed from the PPA.\n", "Q: Email Piping with Thunderbird I have a PHP script (osTicket) that has the ability for parsing piped emails.\nIn theory it would be very simple to execute a script and post the email source code to it.\nIs there a plugin available that does that? Or is there any other possible option?\n\nA: Thunderbird does not have a way to pipe in custom scripts to send out emails.\nAn option you should look into would be to setup a postfix service on the osTicket server to allow it to send out messages from localhost out.\nIn the documentation mentioned by osTicket ( http://osticket.com/wiki/Email_Piping ), they talk about how to set it up for cPanel.

This will only work if you if you are editing the /etc/aliases file. Read the manual page for more information on how to initialize alias data for postfix man newaliases. \nStep 6: Test if it works\necho \"TEST Email\" | mail -s \"This is a test\" support@domain.com\nOnce its been complete, you should be able to read the mail log to make sure it used the php script when sending it: /var/log/mail.log\nYou should see a line about it being sent but being delivered to a command: (delivered to command: /path/to/api/pipe.php)\nWebsite References\nOfficial information from osTicket about email piping\nhttp://osticket.com/wiki/Email_Piping\nQuestion about postfix piping\nhttps://stackoverflow.com/questions/6723596/piping-with-postfix-aliases-and-mysql\npiping.html - More detailed explanation about piping for a helpdesk service called Vision Helpdesk\nhttp://www.thevisionworld.com/vision-helpdesk-faqs-exim-postfix-qmail-sendmail-email \n", "Q: Spotify support in Clementine broken 12.04 also purging doesn't work I downloaded Clementine because I heard it had all sorts of connections to online music sources, including spotify.  I had it installed before but it was from the software center and didn't have spotify for some reason.  So I uninstall that and install it from the .deb on clementine's website.  I open it up put my login info in and install the plugin that it needs to support spotify.  I start playing some songs from my spotify and it works just fine.\nBut then I accidentally right clicked and selected one of my playlist to sync for offline listening, so I exited clementine to make it stop doing that.  Now whenever I try to play something on spotify on it, it just plays like the first second of the track then skips to the next track and then stops completely, also spotify results aren't showing up in the search bar even though I have spotify checked off to be in the searches.\nI tried \"complete removal\" in synaptic and the purge command in the terminal on it to completely remove it so I could reinstall again and fix the problem, and the purge command does work on it, but when I reinstall it, it still remembers all my settings, like my logins and layout choices and songs in my playlist.  It's as if it doesn't realize that I even purged it.\nI don't know how to fix it, there isn't a .clementine folder in the home folder for me to look at and I don't know why purging it isn't working.\n\nA: You will have to remove your configurations files.  \nPaste this at terminal:  \nrm -R ~/.config/Clementine  \n\nOr open Nautilus, press Ctrl + H and navigate to ~/.config, find the folder Clementine and delete it.  \n", "Q: Eclipse won't work in 12.04 64 bit I just finished upgrading my ubuntu\nI had eclipse installed from terminal using apt-get install eclipse\nNow I'm getting the following error\n\nAn error has occurred.

After picking the \"Retry\" option it continues, and at the end of installation it shows Unable to install Ubuntu.\nI've tried both a USB drive and a CD, but the result was the same.\nIs there any easy to install version of Ubuntu, which can just connect the Internet and download missing/corrupted/damaged/etc.files instead of failing installation?\n\nA: There used to be; it was called the mini installer I think. It did basically what you said - a 20MB iso which got some basic settings and downloaded the rest from a mirror.  Unfortunately after looking through both cdimage.ubuntu.com and releases.ubuntu.com it looks like they've dropped support. I'd try downloading another copy of the iso.\nEDIT: Just thought; if you have another PC available, you could try network booting the installer, and that will allow you to download everything from a mirror.\n\nA: No, there is not. But if a file is corrupted, just redownload Ubuntu and put the new one onto your USB. Often a corrupted file just means something went a bit wrong when you either downloaded or copied the file.\n", "Q: How to reset name shown in terminal  When I installed ubuntu 12, my terminal was showing user@XYZ.

Set window Always On Top is very useful.\nHow to visually indicate whether a window is Always On Top?\nFor example, add a icon like:\n \nat the top right corner.

If you go into CompizConfig and enable commands, you can set one of the commands to something that will modify the window appearance. Then you can set the key binding for it to the same binding you use to toggle Always On Top. I just don't know how to make it change the appearance of the window. I was trying wmctrl -r :ACTIVE -b toggle,shaded which I thought would toggle a shadow, but it hides/unhides the window. Not really what I was going for. Keep in mind you have to install the wmctrl package for that to work.\nI don't know of any readily supported ways to modify the appearance a single window.

Here 127.0.0.1 means, squid only allows from the EC2 server itself, so you most likely have to use lync or other such tool to send requests from ec2. I guess you are testing from your home computer and it is not 127.0.0.1. You should find out your public IP address and enter it in your config.\nAdditionally, you specified /32 in your IP.

If you're installing Emacs onto a server or other environment that lacks an X window system, you should fetch this version instead.  (Note that emacs23 works just fine on the terminal, so the only reason to prefer emacs23-nox to emacs23 is if you don't want to drag in the dependencies.)\ne3 and jove are not Emacs; they're lightweight editors that have Emacs modes to them.\nemacs23-lucid is XEmacs, which used to be called \"Lucid Emacs\".\n", "Q: Software center and Command Line Can somebody explain me what is \"Install it from Software Center\", and \"install from a command line\" please?.

What will be the advantage or disadvantage of using a logical partition to install Ubuntu 12.04? Here are the screen-shots of what I have done so far using GParted. \nBefore editing the File system:\n\nAfter editing the File System:\n\nFile system view from Windows 7 x64.\n\nNow my question is ,should I install Ubuntu 12.04 in this partition or shrink the C: drive (sda1) to free up some space and install Ubuntu there ? \nIs there any advantage of installing Ubuntu on a Primary drive or is there any disadvantage of installing Ubuntu on a Logical Drive ?\n\nA: Logical partitions exist to overcome the limitation of MBR (Master Boot Record) which only permits 4 \"physical\" (IE non logical) partitions. There is no difference in operation between logical and physical partitions. \nIt's arguably better to use logical partitions as it allows the creation of more than 4 partitions in the future. 1 logical partition group takes up one physical partition space but can hold lots (don't know the limit) of logical partitions.\n\nA: You can install Ubuntu on any partition.  In fact, I never create primary partitions at all; I create one big extended partition, and all installations are installed in this extended partition (I don't have Windows, though).\nUsing this method, you are not limited to 4 partitions, and it's much easier to resize partitions if needed.  I don't know of any downside to not using primary partitions at all.\n\nA: There is no advantage or disadvantage of installing Ubuntu on a primary or logical partition. The only \"drawback\" if you can call it that way is that if you select logical, the names of the /dev/sd will start at 5. But if you select primary they will start at 1.\nFor example:\nPrimary\n/dev/sda1\n/dev/sda2\n...\nLogical\n/dev/sda5\n/dev/sda6\n...\nBasically is nothing to worry about.\nAs far as I can see, you are good to go installing Ubuntu on that 55GB space you have left in your logical space. The one I mean is this:\n\nSo no need to worry about it. Just install it and enjoy.\n", "Q: 12.04 LTS Live CD Splash Screen Hangs i tried to put ubuntu 12.04 lts on a clean hard drive and when i try to boot to the cd the splash screen hangs. i've tried it on 3 different computers (all with 1 GB of ram). 11.10 Worked fine.\n\nA: When it is booting you can tap the escape key to show verbose output.

I'm trying to change the background color of the menu bar in Ubuntu but no luck.\nMy current theme is Ambiance.\nI've tried to change the file named gtkrc in the Ambiance theme folder but no luck.\nAny ideas on how I can do this?\n\nA: If you're aware of CSS than you would have a greater control over color and style of the top panel. Following is how you can do it with Ambiance theme.\n\n\n*\n\n*Open Nautilus as root, since you'll be backing up and editing files.\ngksu nautilus\n\n*From here, make sure all file operations that you do are from this instance of nautilus that you opened using command.\n\n*Navigate to /usr/share/themes/Ambiance/gtk-3.0/apps directory\n\n\n*\n\n*Before you do anything, make copy of files unity.css and gnome-panel.css in the directory to somewhere in your home folder so that if you mess up anything, you can revert back the changes easily.\n\n\n*Since you want to change color of top panel in Unity, open unity.css for editing in a text-editor (gedit).\n\n*Now create CSS variable as follows at the topmost of the file\n@define-color dark_bg_color #DCDCDC;\n@define-color dark_fg_color #3f3f3f;\n\n\n*Note that variable dark_bg_color indicates the panel background color you want to have, set its value with the hashcode of the color you want.\n\n*Similarly, variable dark_fg_color indicates foreground color i.e. font color of the panel items, set it with hashcode the value you want.\n\n*Finally, save the file and exit. Logout, and login again, and changes you made should be visible. You can modify the values as you want, and in case you want to get back default panel color of Ambiance back, just open Nautilus as root and replace file unity.css with the one you backed up earlier.\nWhile above mentioned method can be used to tweak color of Unity top panel, you can make similar changes in gnome-panel in GNOME classic, by making similar changes in file gnome-panel.css.\nThe steps I gave above might sound a bit complicated but they're pretty easy than styling any OS (AKA Windows) you think.

If I went to the advanced options, it would show the internal drive.  Any ideas why it won't let me install there?\n\nA: If you already have 4 primary partitions on your main hard drive, this could be the issue.\nYou can check this with the gparted utility that comes with Ubuntu, just boot the live CD, open terminal and execute:\ngksu gparted\n\nSome computer manufacturer create multiple backup partitions to enable a system recovery.

Thanks to TechZilla for all his help!\n\nA: The first thing you need to check is GLX Direct Rendering, You can use the generic mesa-utils, or fglrxinfo which is provided by FGLRX.  You already have fglrxinfo  installed, so you should try that first.\nRun this command in a terminal.\nfglrxinfo\n\nReport back what the output shows, which will tell us if the fglrx is configured correctly.\nnext get glxinfo, which is installed via\nsudo apt-get install  mesa-utils\n\nRun this command to get your direct rendering status, it will be a yes or no answer.\nglxinfo  | grep rendering\n\nUse xvinfo to check for Video Overlay.

I want it so my wife can choose OS easily on her newly Dual booting PC. \nI would also like to know if updating Burg after this would keep the change - as the big graphics of the OS's are a little more noob friendly.\n\nA: Setting timeout to -1 will make GRUB wait infinitely.\nBy that I mean that you will be required to manually select an entry and hit Enter before launching any OS.\n\nA: Edit /etc/default/grub (with root privileges), change GRUB_TIMEOUT value from 10 to -1, save the file and then run sudo update-grub. Reboot and now you have infinite time to choose the OS.\nWhile this works in GRUB, it doesn't work with BURG, and you'll have to change GRUB_TIMEOUT value to some large number like 120 seconds to wait before booting into any OS and run sudo update-burg to reflect the changes.

Is this a disc partition?  Can I increase it easily later if it's too small?\nI came here to ask these questions and now I see a bunch of threads about 'WUBI' and possible downsides of installing Ubuntu this way. Is the Windows Installer I just downloaded going to give me WUBI?\n\nA: As you have established, you have downloaded WUBI.\nThe \"Installation size\" options lets you decide the amount of space you want to \"give up\" for WUBI. That is the space wubi's Ubuntu install is able to use.\nWubi creates a disk image (loopmounted device) on your host system in/on which Ubuntu is installed. This can be compared to a kind of \"safe partition\" on your system.\nThis means the space you reserve for Wubi is not usable for your host system any more (in fact it is not even accessible from within the host system without external programmes. Ubuntuforums: Accessing Wubi Disks from Windows , AskUbuntu: How to open wubi's .disk files under windows?). Windows 7 (any Windows for that matter) will count the space you reserve for your Wubi install as occupied since Wubi just creates a file of exactly the amount of space you specified (let's say 20 GB) on your host system's harddisk, regardless of the space actually occupied in your Ubuntu Wubi system.\nApparently, there are ways to resize the wubi virtual disk (Help.Ubuntu: ResizeWubiDisk, Ubuntuforums: HOWTO: Resize the WUBI virtual disk).\nYou need to reserve enough space for Wubi to install Ubuntu and - if you want to use it properly - to install programmes. Additionally, you will want to have some space for documents etc.\nSo I'd recommend no less then 8GB of space, maybe even as much as 20GB if you can spare that much.\n\nA: Here's the Ubuntu (32 Bit Desktop) ISO download link: http://ubuntu.virginmedia.com/releases//precise/ubuntu-12.04-desktop-i386.iso\nHere's the Wubi download link: http://mirror01.th.ifl.net/releases//precise/wubi.exe\n", "Q: How can I restart the \"mobile brodband\" / modem ? is it possible without restarting the whole system?

Is there anything I can do to make this work automatically after a reboot.\n\nA: See the last post here:\nhttp://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=1902715\n\nsudo modprobe -v rt2800usb\n\nand the wireless worked immediately.\nI then removed the blacklisted drivers (which I added earlier) from\n  /etc/modprobe.d/blacklist.conf\nNext I added rt2800usb to /etc/modules. Rebooted and my wireless\n  starts up automatically.\n\n", "Q: Having issues installing Ubuntu It is taking an incredibly long time to try and install and now I am currently waiting at the twitter installation section but the progress bar has gone.

When Ubuntu publishes a patch to packages, do they update the install media?\nIf I download a \"live CD\", will it be pre-patched?\nWhat about SRU (stable release updates)?\n\nA: The LiveCD images for an Ubuntu version which is still in beta/development get updated on a daily basis in its daily live images. For instance, you can get an up-to-date development version of upcoming Ubuntu 12.10 here.\nThe LiveCD for a version is not update once it is released as final. Then, updates are only pushed through the Update Manager.\nFor an LTS release, however, Canonical releases maintenance updates (like Windows Service Packs) periodically, which include patches released for the version. For instance, Ubuntu 10.04 is in its 4th maintenance update which can be downloaded here.\n\nA: Generally, updates aren't patched into the install CD, but from 12.04 installers have the ability to download updates during installation from a mirror.\n", "Q: Extremely low 3D perfomance I recently bought a Radeon HD 6850 and installed a fresh version of 12.04 on my computer.\nIt has 4GB RAM, a somewhat fast CPU and a suprisingly fast S-ATA HDD.\nHowever I noticed that my 3D performance is extremely low, which causes the whole system to be slow.\nAs mentioned in this question, glgears has an average FPS of 70 and fgl_glxgears an average of 45.\nI am using Unity 2D and have the supported driver from \"Additional Drivers\" installed.

Does anyone know of a simple \"Hello World\" for making games for ubuntu? I've seen the Getting Started with Quickly video.\nAny examples for platformers or something like that?\nEDIT:\nJust a recap of the answers.\nBlender Game engine -- Uses python\nPygame -- Python\nMonoGame http://monogame.codeplex.com/ -- some sort of XNA ?\nQuakeC -- This a Quake flavored C like lang.

Then just develop the game.\nSince a lot of applications on Ubuntu are open source you can find one in the software center that is free and use the following command:\n    sudo apt-get source gameName\nThat will give you an idea of how games that already exist are made for Ubuntu. You can also research how to package debian packages for when you think you are ready for distribution.\n\nA: Have you checked out PyGame? it is a great library for making games. There is lots of games already made that you can read the code and learn a thing or two. I am currenlty devoting my free time in learning to make a platform game just for the sake of learning. I will post my learnings and reply later with some actual work\nPlease do check out http://www.pygame.org/wiki/tutorials\nHope this helps\n\nA: Panda3D is a nice cross platform game library for Python and C++. It's developed and maintained by a group at Carnegie Mellon, and it has been used in a few commercial titles. It adds simpler abstractions over OpenGL, OpenAL, and Bullet, and there are a number of getting started examples available, including a 2D asteroids game.\nhttp://www.panda3d.org/\nhttp://www.panda3d.org/manual/index.php/Sample_Programs_in_the_Distribution\n\nA: I strongly advice to get interested in this: http://monogame.codeplex.com/ \n\nA: One fast and easy option is Quickly.   \nCreating a project is as easy as typing this at terminal:  \nquickly create ubuntu-application my-new-project\n\nSee this intro video.  \nAlso this is a great site: http://developer.ubuntu.com/get-started/ \nAnd, of course, the manual:  man quickly \nYou will be using python which is also great for 3d games, see Panda3D.\n\nA: Some game engines that work with ubuntu are Panda3D and love2d. Both are very easy to learn and have good documentation and community.\n\nA: Unfortunately, there is no simple Hello World for games. The smallest Hello World ive ever been able to come up with for a game using just code, not quickly or pygame, is about 50 lines of C code that inits opengl and various C headers, sets up some opengl stuff and opens a window with hello world printed.\nGame programming, even on Linux, is not as simple as most people think.\nIf you want something easier though, Blender 2.6 has a built in game engine, it uses Python and is very intuitive, but less flexible than straight C + OpenGL in my opinion.\nSome resources:\nnehe.gamedev.net\nGoogle ;)\nthere are other floating around, i just cant remember the names of them, sorry :|.\n\nA: I would also like to recommend qt and qml\n\nA: Here is a 50 line Tic-Tac-Toe: \nimport java.awt.*;  \nimport java.awt.event.*;\nimport javax.swing.*;\n\npublic class TicTacToe extends JFrame implements ActionListener {\n    private JButton [] button  = new JButton [9];\n    private int count = 0;\n\n    public TicTacToe () {           \n        super (\"Tic-Tac-Toe\");\n        setSize (300, 300);\n        setDefaultCloseOperation (JFrame.EXIT_ON_CLOSE);\n        setLayout (new GridLayout (3, 3));\n        init ();\n    }\n\n    private void init () {           \n        count = 0;\n        for (int i = 0; i < 9; ++i) {\n            button [i] = new JButton (\"\");\n            button [i].addActionListener (this);\n            add (button [i]);\n        }\n        setVisible (true);\n    }\n\n    public void actionPerformed (ActionEvent a) {    \n        String letter = (++count % 2 == 1) ? \"X\" : \"O\";\n        for (JButton jb : button) \n        if (a.getSource () == jb) {\n            jb.setText (letter);\n            jb.setEnabled (false);\n        }\n        if (count == 9) {\n            for (JButton jb : button) \n                remove (jb) ;\n            init ();\n        }\n    }\n\n    public static void main (String [] args) {           \n        new TicTacToe ();\n    }\n}\n\nSince it is Java, it isn't bound to Ubuntu, not even Linux,  but will run on Solaris, Apple and Windows as well - where a JVM is. \nBut that is similar for solutions in Smalltalk, Python, Ruby, ... - even in C or C++ when a portable framework is used like Qt or Gnome, and not some proprietary MFC-classes. In C and C++, of course you have to recompile the stuff. \n\nA: The simplicity of making games is based on the programming language/environment you choose. For advanced programmers, coding your game directly in a programming language of choice (C/C++/Python/Java/etc) may be the best way.\nFor hobbyists/non-coders who like a simple drag and drop interface to create games, I recommend 'Stencyl' (http://www.stencyl.com/).\nThe 'Stencyl' help website has all the resources for getting you started with creating games. You can also directly go to the 'Crash Course 2' help page to create your first game entirely from scratch in 'Stencyl' (http://www.stencyl.com/help/view/crash-course-invaders-1/).

I imagine that this is probably not possible, but worth asking because I'd find it useful if it were!\nI dual boot my system with Ubuntu 12.04 and Windows 7. Though I rarely nowadays use Windows so whenever I do have to boot into it there are always lots of updates to install and I have to wait when shutting down for these to install before I can access Ubuntu again.\nSo I was wondering whether it would be possible to somehow keep Windows updated in the background from Ubuntu? Is there a way to mount the Windows partition and run the Window Updater or is this way to complicated a task?\n\nA: No that's Impossible you need to be In Windows to update Windows, the same way you need to be in Ubuntu to update Ubuntu. Unless of course you're in a Virtualmachine where the 2 systems are running at the same time.\n\nA: The problem there is that you have to stay on Windows for those Updates to finish downloading and be applied. So it would be a definite no. Sorry. \nThe only way to update Windows is to be in Windows, specially Windows 7 and using the Windows Updater. The exception would be to copy/paste the updates from another PC but I doubt that everything would work correctly at the end because of the registry information and service information applied in some updates to windows.\n\nA: Your best option will be to reinstall windows on virtual box then you can run both at the same time, if you have enough RAM. \nI have Ubuntu 12.04 x64 with a dual boot win7. And 4GB ram. I allocated 2GB to win 7 and can run both pretty smoothly at the same time.

So I could be missing the settings \nThank you.\n\nA: I'm also having sound issues. I haven't found an exact fix yet but mine works fine in Windows also and sounds similar to your issue. I am getting sound on my ASUS ve228 but not on my vt1720 PCI card. \nWhat I have done to enable the sound on the card is reboot into recovery. Run the fix file systems then repair packages. Then reboot. Then it works for me but if I restart again it fails. Then I have to repeat the process. \nIt works and haven't had any issues other than having to do this almost every time I restart. It might at least get you by till you can fix it permanently.\n\nA: Try to boot from any of the Linux LiveCDs.\nOn my Toshiba Tecra A8 I tried Puppy Linux 4. I couldn't hear any sound when I booted from the Puppy Linux 4, but when I rebooted to my Ubuntu 15.04 the sound was back.

I Upgraded an Acer Extensa with an integrated nvidia 7050/nv620i, from 10.04 to 12.04.(full reinstall)\nWith the buggy nvidia driver 295.40,the system was unuable.\nI downloaded from nvidia site and manually installed the following drivers that doesn't work perfectly:\n295.49;\n295.33;\n302.07 (beta);\nThe situation was better than 295.40, but still non usable.\nMoving from one desktop to another keep 2 seconds. Clicking on hour/date applet on top bar, shows the small windows drawing slowly....\nWhat can Nvidia user do ?\nIs it possible to state which Nvidia series works by sure : \n100, 200, 400, 500 ?? Which one ?\nFor production environment, is changing card brand the only viable solution ?\n\nA: In 10.04 the following drivers were available:\n\n\n*\n\n*nvidia-96 - GPUs ranging from GeForce series 2 (except for GeForce2 GTS/GeForce2 Pro, GeForce2 Ti and GeForce2 Ultra) to Geforce series 7 are supported\n\n*nvidia-173 - GPUs ranging from GeForce series 5 to Geforce series 9 are supported\n\n*nvidia-current (195) - GPUs such as GeForce series 6 or newer are supported\n\n\nThe compatibility notes are directly from the package description (should be 3rd paragraph) and haven't changed much in 12.04. It is worth noting that nvidia-current moved from 180 over to 185 and from there to 195 during the 10.04 life cycle. \nUsing nvidia-current might have worked very well in 10.04. But you have to understand how Nvidia maintains their proprietary drivers. This is not limited to Linux/Unix drivers and applies to Windows in a similar fashion and AMD/ATI is no different there. \nFor Linux, Nvidia maintains 3 versions of drivers: One for very old cards (2000-2005, I know that this is not exact, but let's try to keep it as simple as possible) with a very limited set of features, one for rather newer cards (2005-2010) with more features and one with support for the latest cards (2010 onward) and all features they provide. This is done to reduce the maintenance effort as much as possible. If implementing support for a new series or feature breaks support for older cards or makes them unstable, then this is a sacrifice to be made and users of those cards have to switch to an older but still maintained/compatible driver series. \nAlso you need to know a bit more about the particular chip. Wikipedia says it is a chip from 2007, however Geforce Series 7 was released in 2006 and most low end designs are based on the previous series or even earlier. So actually were talking about a low cost design from 2005 or 2004.\nMy advice in your case: Remove all old drivers and install the nvida-173 driver, it should be sufficient to run Compiz (I did that back in 2008 with 08.04, version back than was 140 or 160), however the chip may not be fast enough to run Unity, you could try to disable blur in CCSM, if that doesn't help you have to use Unity 2D.\n\nA: Have you checked these lists?\nhttps://wiki.ubuntu.com/HardwareSupportComponentsVideoCardsNvidia\nhttp://www.ubuntu.com/certification/catalog/make/NVIDIA%20Corporation/?page=1\n\nA: I don't know exactly but I do know that the old 7*** desktop series definetly works.\nADVICE: Uninstall old drivers and install new ones from the nvidia site, the upgrades make a huge difference.\n\nA: I've used Nvidia through the years and ever since they've had a System Settings function to recommend and provide proprietary drivers, I was successful taking the driver they recommended. My current mobo has a 7025 chip set on it which worked without issue with Ubuntu 11.04. I've upgraded to a 210 board which also works nicely, now with a 1980x1080 monitor and Ubuntu 12.04 with the 295.40 Nvidia driver. I can only speak for what I've myself used.\n", "Q: Software to connect a Professional Digital Camera My brother has a Canon EOS 310 which frankly scares the bejesus out of me when I hold it because is heavy (and expensive). Anyway I am trying to get the pictures from the camera to Ubuntu but it only detects it as a pen drive. What software exists to open, view and extract the images from this camera.\n\nA: Found one and not anywhere, inside Software Center. Darktable:\n\nBut I still could not fix the problem about getting the images. The problem was that I needed to unmount the camera. It can't be mounted if I want to connect darktable and extract the images.\nLove Ubuntu more everyday. I mean it has everything.\n\nA: There should be alot of files a couple of folders down may be like \"DCIM\" and then files like DCS00001.RAW or some other extension, it differs per camera.\nYou need to install a program to read those files, I use RawTherapee , Search for \"raw\" in software center and you should be able to find a couple of different programs that will work. RawTherapee works very similarly to Photoshop Raw.\nAs for getting the images, some cameras do not have support for getting them off with usb the normal way (in support of their propitiatory software to get them off) so you may need to take the memory card out and use a memory card reader.\n", "Q: upgrade from 11.10 to 12.04 - No upgrade option available in update manager Update manger do not provide option to upgrade.

If you don't already have it, you can install it using:\nsudo apt install brasero\n\nHow can I create ISO images with Brasero?\n\n*\n\n*Hit the Super key (Windows key) and search for \"brasero\" and open it.\n\n\n*Click on the Data project button.\n\n\n\n*Click on the green plus button in the upper left corner in the toolbar to start adding files and directories to your image:\n\n\n*\n\n*Enter the name of disc at the bottom to whatever you like.\n\n*Make sure no empty CD/DVD is in your optical drives and click on Burn.\n\n*Brasero will ask you for the location where you want to create ISO image, Give your desired location and click on Create Image. That's it!\n\nIf you want to burn that image to disc, Just right click on ISO image you just created and select \"Open With Brasero Disc Burner\". Select your optical drive and click Create Image.\n\n\nA: Try This:\nGo to the Terminal\nType genisoimage -o ~/backup.iso -V BACKUP -R -J ~/Documents\nor, for more useful permissions, change -R to -r:\ngenisoimage -o ~/backup.iso -V BACKUP -r -J ~/Documents\nIn this case Ubuntu will generate a file called \"backup.iso\" with all the contents in the Documents Folder.\nhttp://www.jonathanmoeller.com/screed/?p=3513\n\nA: I actually had to do this just today.

I have just created Windows 7 ISO file with no problems. Didn't really liked the Brasero method because it keep throwing pop-up windows. It had some compatibility issues with file names and ISO standard. I believe this method is compatible with Mac OS ISO's as well. \nThis answer is provided by using Archive Manager, the default archive manager in Ubuntu 14.10.\nOpen your folder with files you want to include in ISO.

Type dd if=/dev/cdrom of=~/cdrom_image.iso.\nOR\n3B. Type mkisofs -o /tmp/cd.iso /tmp/directory/ To make an ISO from files on your hard  drive.\nYou must have permission to access the drive directly using dd. mount permissions are not necessarily the same as dd permissions!\nAlso... when creating an ISO file, the device must not be mounted. To unmount the cdrom device, use the umount command as follows:\n\numount /dev/cdrom\n\nYou may also use sudo to ensure you have proper permissions, but this also means you must have sudo access on the system. Check the /etc/sudoers file for information.\n\nA: Making ISO file feature is already there in Ubuntu as VRR said in his answer.

See http://www.infradead.org/openconnect/juniper.html\n\nA: The latest version of openjdk and icedtea plugin work with Juniper VPN. Removing older and other versions of Java may also help.\nSee Could anyone provide a step by step for getting juniper netconnect and citrix?\nThis is one place where I found command line works better than the Ubuntu Software Center\nFirst remove older versions of Java, both Oracle (Sun) and OpenJDK. For example, if you have OpenJDK 6 installed, type in a terminal:\nsudo apt-get remove openjdk-6-jdk icedtea-6-plugin\n\nRemove the Sun Java as well. If you have installed just the JRE, rather than JDK change the commands accordingly. Then install the OpenJDK-7 and corresponding plugin by:\nsudo apt-get install openjdk-7-jdk icedtea-7-plugin\n\nOpen Firefox and test the version of Java is being used by going to this site http://www.java.com/en/download/testjava.jsp\nNote: As of Chrome 35 , the Java support for the Chrome on Linux has been discontinued. You have to use Firefox to make Java (and therefore Network Connect) work.\nIf you see version 7 is running, you are ready to try Juniper VPN. If not you may have to remove the other version of Java. Hope this helps.\n\nUpdate: for 64bit Ubuntu 12.04 to 13.10\nFrom 7.3 onwards, Juniper SA devices support 64-bit Ubuntu for Network Connect. \nFirst, install the 64bit jre/jdk and icedtea \nsudo apt-get install openjdk-7-jre icedtea-7-plugin\n\nSecond, install the 32bit jre\nsudo apt-get install openjdk-7-jre:i386\n\nNote, do not install the 32bit icedtea. Make sure the 64bit is the default java. As long as the 32bit jre exists, Juniper will find the files it needs and run.\nTested on Ubuntu 13.04 64bit.\nSee Juniper Network Knowledge-base for details.\n\nUpdate 2: for 64bit Ubuntu 14.04\nNetwork Connect is looks for update-alternatives in /usr/sbin/ and there seems to be no symlink pointing to the right directory like 13.10 had. \nIn addition to the steps above for 64 bit Ubuntu 12.04-13.10, add symlink to /usr/sbin/ by: \nsudo ln -s /usr/bin/update-alternatives /usr/sbin/\n\nThe 14.04 issue is explained in more detail at How to install Juniper VPN on Ubuntu 14.04 LTS?\n\nA: Update for 14.04 Trusty Tahr (64-bit)\nFirst run with Network Connect on 14.04 resulted a failure and Network Connect just complained about missing 32-bit libraries. My NC version is 7.4R6. I did have all the libraries installed and openjdk-7-jre:i386 installed. \nDigging a little bit deeper revealed that Network Connect is using update-alternatives listing to decide if 32-bit jre is installed.\n/usr/sbin/alternatives command not found\nCommand = /bin/sh -c /usr/sbin/update-alternatives --display java 2>&1 | grep -v \"/bin/sh:\" | grep ^/ | cut -d \" \" -f 1 | tr \" \" \" \"\n\nHowever it's looking update-alternatives from /usr/sbin/ and there seems to be no symlink pointing to the right directory like 13.10 had.

Previously I've used both the built-in vino and tightvncserver to provide the VNC session. I connect to them using Chicken of the VNC on my Mac. \nWith the older version, VNC performance was pretty good. Now with 12.04, it is abysmal using vino. Updates are sluggish, menus flicker and vanish, lots of extra screen redraws, etc.\nAny pointers on recovering some performance? Thanks.\n\nA: By default 12.04 takes advantage of hardware acceleration. The graphical interface is so on the graphics card instead of on the CPU. This should grant overall better performance and augmented visual effects on decently spec'd desktop/laptop computers.\nAll that comes to a cost though. Apart from the fact that complex visual effects require more bandwidth, Vino doesn't seem ready for hardware compositing (GPU acceleration) anyway.\nIf you have a very good connection to the computer (ie. local wired connection), you can try to disable what is called \"xdamage\". Open the terminal and issue the following command (as standard user, not root):\ngsettings set org.gnome.Vino disable-xdamage true\n\nThis will force the server to re-send the whole screen at each refresh and not just the changed areas. It is extremely stressful for your network of course.\nAs an alternative to entering this command in a terminal window, you may use the dconf-editor which can be installed using the Ubuntu Software Center.\nIf you feel adventurous you may also try to install \"CompizConfig Settings Manager\" (package compizconfig-settings-manager) and carefully reduce the number of effects (especially those related to windows and menus placement). The fewer the better for VNC.\nOtherwise you can try to disable compositing altogether and login into Unity 2d you can follow these instructions, but you are of course disabling 3d effects and HW acceleration.\n\nA: you also could compiz replace with the command:\n\nmetacity --replace&\n\nThis gives much better results using vnc and is easy to use.

On my laptop using 12.04 I would like to have two virtual desktops, one should be visable only to the person using the computer and the other should be the one that is shown when I attach an external device.\nAt the moment I use the \"mirror display\" (not sure about the english name for it) functionallity or the \"not mirror display\" option, but with different virtual desktops it would be nice to set up the \"external monitor\" before and afterwards look at some notes while giving talks etc.\nHow can I ajust the settings to achieve this?\nSaw a lot of old questions, but no real solution. Maybe this got better with Precise multi-monitor support.\n\nA: On my laptop I was able to do this as follows:\nGo to Dash Home and type Displays and select the Displays control panel.\nPlug in the external monitor.\nTurn off mirroring. You should see two screens depicted in the control panel display.\nSelect the external monitor's box, move it to the orientation you would like, turn the external monitor on with the panel's on/off control, set its resolution, and then press Apply. They should both blank for a second or two and then come on.\nI use Unity 3d and was unable to put them side by side as the sum of the two widths exceeded 2048 (my Laptop is pretty wide compared to how tall it is.) I simply positioned the second display under the first, set a resolution for it and turned it on (with mirroring off, of course), and it came up properly as above.\nI was able to move back and forth between screens by moving my cursor down off my laptop desktop and onto the external monitor desktop. Just drag the presentation or other window down to put it on the external monitor.\nI suppose I could have also switched to Unity 2d instead of putting one screen under the other in the virtual desktop, but I don't see what difference it makes.\nThe command line program to do this sort of thing is xrandr. I've used that command to put together a little shell script I would it run when I connected to an external monitor to set the second screens's resolution properly and activate it. I put a shortcut on my desktop for it so I wouldn't have to make my audience wait. The particular xrandr options are --right-of --left-of --above and --below.\n\nxrandr --output VGA-0 --mode 1280x1024\nxrandr --output VGA-0 --below LVDS\nxrandr --output LVDS --mode 1440x900\n\n", "Q: Moonlight not working on firefox or chromium - Ubuntu 11.04 I'm trying to watch my sky films but I need silverlight of course.

I'm\n  trying to add an extended partition for the ext4 partition and the\n  linux-swap partition, but I already have four primary partitions which\n  all look like they're something important.\nThe four partitions are this:\n\n\n\n*\n\n* Partition 1:\n\n*\n\n*Partition: /dev/sda1\n\n*File System: ntfs\n\n*Label: None\n\n*Size: 199.00MiB\n\n*Used: 66.59 MiB\n\n*Unused: 132.41MiB\n\n*Flags: Boot\n\n\n\n*Partition 2:\n\n*\n\n*Partition: /dev/sda2\n\n*File System: ntfs\n\n*Label: None\n\n*Size: 219.29GiB\n\n*Used: 28.11GiB\n\n*Unused: 191.17GiB\n\n*Flags: None\n\n\n\n*Partition 3:\n\n*\n\n*Partition: /dev/sda3\n\n*File System: ntfs\n\n*Label: RECOVERY\n\n*Size: 13.30GiB\n\n*Used: 11.09GiB\n\n*Unused: 2.22GiB\n\n*Flags: None\n\n\n\n*Partition 4:\n\n*\n\n*Partition: /dev/sda4\n\n*File System: fat32\n\n*Label: HP_TOOLS\n\n*Size: 103.18MiB\n\n*Used: 7.47MiB\n\n*Unused: 95.71MiB\n\n*Flags: lba\n\n\n\n\nI know that Windows 7 is the /dev/sda2 and I'd assume that /dev/sda3\n  is some sort of backup. I don't know what /dev/sda4 but I've watched a\n  video that said that generally a fat32 partition is the boot or\n  something. As for /dev/sda1 I have no idea.\nWhich one should I delete to make space for an extended partition?\n\n\nA: *\n\n*/dev/sda3 is your Windows recovery partition.\n\n*/dev/sda4 is a recovery partition for the HP tools.\n\n\nYou can delete both if you not need them or if you made a backup of these to a cd/dvd.\nOr leave it as is. Or after you created a backup. Technically all you need is the Windows serial on your machine to be allowed re-installing (ie. downloading Windows). And it would be weird if you can not find the HP Tools on the web either. \n\n\n*\n\n*/dev/sda1 looks like a separate boot disc. Could be they made that so you can access your 2 recovery partitions. Never seen that before... If you delete this you might not be able to get into Windows. As far as I know Windows needs to be on the 1st partition(?). If so messing with that will mess up Windows.\n\n\nMy advice? Create discs from the Windows recovery and HP recovery if you want them (creating a cd/dvd from them should be a menu item in your current Windows system). Backup your Windows files and delete it ALL. Recreate a 2 partition setup: 1 for Windows and 1 for Ubuntu (and in there /, swap and /home if you want to). \nI believe creating 4 primary partitions is stupid. And I myself hate it when others decide my disc lay-out. ;)\n\n\n*\n\n*Regarding a backup of those recovery discs I found this link: http://h10025.www1.hp.com/ewfrf/wc/document?docname=c01867124&lc=en&cc=vn&dlc=en\n\nA: Recovery from the recovery partition appears to be somewhat fragile when you mess with your partitions, so I would also advise to make a Windows backup rather than rely on the restore partition.\nWindows nowadays uses a small 'system partition' in addition to the regular windows partition. So that is your sda1.\nIt also depends on how much you want to keep your current Windows installation: you can legally download an official Windows ISO, use it for a fresh install and activate it with your original license key. A list of iso images can be found at http://www.heidoc.net/joomla/technology-science/microsoft/14-windows-7-direct-download-links\nWarning: I have been in your situation and wiped the HDD clean. Then I found out that BIOS setup had disappeared from the boot menu, presumably because part of the BIOS code resided in the HP tools partition. Fortunately, it came back after a BIOS update. Otherwise, I haven't missed the HP tools partition. You could first update your BIOS and back up the HP tools partition, then test whether it contains anything of importance by removing its content and see what is missing.\n", "Q: How to add \"Add to VLC playlist\" to the right click menu of Nautilus?

I know that ubuntu-restricted-extras package provides many more multimedia codecs, flash and java support. But it is a big download and I don't need support for file types, Which I am not using now.\nSo, Does anybody know which gstreamer package provides which kind of file type support ?\nA list like gstreamer-ffmpeg -> .mp4, ... will be very useful.\nAnd I have another question,(I still confused, should i ask it here or in another question)  Is it OK to only install the gstreamer packages for all multimedia needs ? or I need some other packages ? and for what needs ?\n\nA: The gstreamer project maintains lists as part of the official documentation for the individual components and plugins. These lists consist not of file extensions but of codecs, containers and formats.\nBut you shouldn't need to have such a list in the first place, particularly not by file extension. If you encounter a file you can't play and there is a package that adds playback support for this format just install it. In a perfect world I'm pretty sure Ubuntu would ship with all codecs installed by default (or there would just be the one perfect format), because you as enduser should never bother with such an issue. Unfortunately there are patent issues, which is mostly why the restricted-extras packages and gstreamer-ugly exist. Also the code quality of some decoders does not meet the standards, the reason for packages like gstreamer-bad, but bad support might in some cases still be better than no support.\nYour second question: Does gstreamer cover all my multimedia needs? Are there alternatives?\nGstreamer is the default multimedia framework used by Ubuntu and the applications in the default installation are chosen to integrate nicely into that environment. Gstreamer has become the de facto standard on the Linux desktop because of its functionality and it is well maintained. Xine was also a popular multimedia framework but it seems like it is no longer actively maintained. That is mostly it for frameworks which are comparable to DirectShow / Media Foundation or QuickTime.\nFFmpeg\nOn the lower level you might have noticed there is FFmpeg which is used as a component in gstreamer and itself provides a lot of functionality. VLC and MPlayer/MPlayer2 are two media players based upon FFmpeg and don't make use of gstreamer. However if the default media player covers all your needs, you don't have to install those.\nBut anime fans for example would enjoy Advanced Substation Alpha (ASS) subtitle format support and H.264 High 10 profile (aka 10-bit) video playback. For this use case the Motu Media launchpad group provides PPAs with daily MPlayer2 builds and the SMPlayer2 front end.

I'd really like to get the system to suspend without having to enter the password. Is there any way I can do this?\n\nA: Open up a terminal and execute sudo visudo.\nThen you can edit the sudoers file where you can specify who can execute which command as root with and without password. At the end of the file you paste either this line\nnonprivilegeduser ALL=NOPASSWD:/usr/sbin/pm-suspend-hybrid\n\nfor every user to be able to execute that command as root without password, or\nYour_Username ALL=NOPASSWD:/usr/sbin/pm-suspend-hybrid\n\nfor only your user to be able to do this (of course you have to adjust it for your user).

You haven't shown your OUTPUT chain, but I'll assume that it accepts everything too. This implies that the connection is blocked somewhere between you and Github. It is possible that your school's firewall blocks outgoing connections to port 22.\nYou can get a better idea of where your packets are intercepted by installing tcptraceroute  and running tcptraceroute github.com 22.\nAsk your school's administrator to open port 22, or at least (if they're reluctant) port 22 to github.com. Your use of the network is a serious use, which should be allowed to students.\nIf the administrators do not budge, and you use a proxy to connect to the web, you might be able to get the proxy to relay traffic (it may or may not work, depending on how the proxy is configured). See Is it possible to SSH through port 80?\nBy the way, your INPUT chain allows all incoming traffic, since you only have ACCEPT rules and an ACCEPT policy. A typical rule set would block incoming UDP traffic on non-vetted ports and block incoming TCP connections on non-vetted ports:\niptables -A INPUT -i lo -j ACCEPT\niptables -A INPUT -m state --state RELATED,ESTABLISHED -j ACCEPT\niptables -A INPUT -p udp --dport 53 -j ACCEPT\niptables -A INPUT -p udp --dport 123 -j ACCEPT\niptables -P INPUT DROP\n\n\nA: Based on your comment, it's almost certain that the school has some sort of filter in place to block either all non port 80 traffic or all non-whitelisted traffic. You could probably get away with a SSH HTTP tunnel as documented here, or you could try a browser based ssh client as shown here.\n", "Q: 12.04 Wireless network asks for WEP key every 5 minutes, Please Help I am running Ubuntu 12.04 64bit Desktop\nI am connecting to my home Wi-fi using wep key, like I do with all of my other devices.

Thanks\nI need this package to install other apps like teamviewer7.\nMy sources.list is here.\n\nA: Since ia32-libs is now a transitional wrapper package around the set of multiarch-enabled libraries that were previously shipped bundled in ia32-libs, all of these library packages must be installable.  In a released version of Ubuntu (such as in the precise and precise-updates pockets), packages will always be individually installable; however, multiarch imposes an additional restriction on installability: the library package must be at the exact same version across all architectures that you are installing it for.\nIn one of the examples given here, the libcairo-gobject2 package is implicated.  This package has recently been updated for 12.04 as an SRU; which means that trying to install ia32-libs requires the amd64 version of libcairo-gobject2 on your system to match the i386 version that will be downloaded.\nTo ensure you're getting the correct versions of all library packages, do the following:\n\n\n*\n\n*Launch Update Manager\n\n*Choose Settings at the bottom of the window\n\n*Under Updates, make sure that Recommended Updates (precise-updates) is selected.\n\n*Click Check to scan for any new software updates\n\n*Click Install Updates to ensure your existing packages are all up to date\n\n\nIf you currently have a broken package installed which depends on ia32-libs, this may ask to remove it.  You should proceed with the removal and reinstall once the operation is completed.  You should then be able to run \nsudo apt-get install ia32-libs\n\nto install ia32-libs, or download package from http://packages.ubuntu.com/ and\nsudo dpkg -i /path/to/package.deb\nsudo apt-get -f install\n\nto install your package and automatically pull in ia32-libs as a dependency.\nNote that ia32-libs is considered deprecated in any case.  For most software, you should instead install the i386 version of the package and let it directly pull the i386 libraries that it needs as dependencies, instead of using ia32-libs which is a catch-all.\n\nA: I have seen this problem manifest you try to install 64-bit third party binaries from debs that end up wanting ia32-libs, e.g. Teamviewer 7 or Skype.\nSolution first, demonstration later:\n\n\n*\n\n*Run:\ndpkg --list `apt-cache rdepends ia32-libs | sed -e '1,2d' -e 's/|//g' | tr '\\n' ' '` | grep iU\n\n\n*And look for half-installed packages with version names, like:\n\niU  skype                                  2.2.0.35-1                              Skype\niU  teamviewer7                            7.0.9350                                TeamViewer (Remote Control Application)\n\n\n*dpkg --remove each offender, after which sudo apt-get install ia32-libs should succeed.\n\nA: I had a similar problem with broken dependencies when trying to install wine and acroread, and a complaint when trying to install ia32-libs-multiarch, just after upgrading to 12.04 from 11.04 (passing over 11.10). It seems that some ppa's I had in 11.04 installed newer versions of applications in the system. After upgrading, the remains of these apps seemed to do some mess in the dependencies.\nThe solution that seems to work (until now), was found on a german ubuntu board (http://forum.ubuntuusers.de, posts from user Lasall):\nFirst a downgrade is required and done with the following:\ncreate the 'preferences' file:\nsudo vi /etc/apt/preferences\n\nand insert the following lines:\nPackage: *       \nPin: release a=precise*\nPin-Priority: 2012\n\nenter:wq to write the file.\nPin-Priority must be greater than 1000.\nThen you may downgrade the offending applications with:\nsudo apt-get dist-upgrade\n\nThen you may install packages that complained about dependencies, like\nsudo apt-get install ia32-libs-multiarch, or sudo apt-get install ia32-libs.\nFinally, you should remove the file you just created:\nsudo rm /etc/apt/preferences\n\nbecause else no new updates would be found.\nHope this helps you too!\n\nA: I know this may seem like a long way around but, try copying and pasting each of those dependencies into the following:\nsudo apt-get install PACKAGE_NAME\n\nFor example this is a line from the error message:\nDepends: **gstreamer0.10-plugins-good**:i386 but it is not going to be installed\n\nThen execute:\nsudo apt-get install gstreamer0.10-plugins-good\n\nMake sure and leave out the :i386 on the end of each command.\nAfter installing each of those try installing ia32-libs-multiarch again:\nsudo apt-get install ia32-libs-multiarch\n\nIf there are no errors, then continue to install ia32-libs.\nsudo apt-get install ia32-libs\n\n\nA: I too face the same problem while installing teamviewer7 64bit package on Precise.\nI think you might have disabled the updates.\nPlease goto Ubuntu Software Center → Edit → Software Sources.\nIn the Updates tab, please check all the updates (you can remove it later) and close.\nPlease go to terminal and run:\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get install ia32-libs\n\nIt worked for me, if not run sudo apt-get dist-upgrade and then try re-installing ia32-libs.\n\nA: You have to add i386 architecture, then update and install ia32-libs. Run the following commands:\nsudo dpkg --add-architecture i386\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get install ia32-libs\n\nIs my best solution in Debian 7.0.\n\nA: 12.04 64 bit:\nIn Ubuntu 12.04 , installed dpkg package version doesn't have any --add-architecture paramater.So you cant add i386 architecture by dpkg --add-architecture i386 method.So run the below command to add i386 architecture to your 64 bit Ubuntu 12.04 .\nsudo sh -c \"echo 'foreign-architecture i386' > /etc/dpkg/dpkg.cfg.d/multiarch\"\n\n\nA: I had the same problem a week ago , this is what does it for me.\nPress ALT+CTRL+T to enter terminal:\n\n\n*\n\n*Type gksu nautilus and press ENTER key\n\n*Click on the folder 'etc'. Next click the folder'apt'.\n\n*Delete the folder sources.list.d \n\n*Right-click and select 'Create New folder' to create a folder\n\n*Rename the new folder to sources.list.d and close the windows.\n\n*At terminal type sudo apt-get install ia32-libs-multiarch\n\n*Input your root password when the system asks for it.\n\n*Press ENTER to continue, and select 'y' for yes to continue with the installation.\nI hope this one helps.  \n\nA: I had a similar problem when trying to install google-earth. What worked for me was to run 'sudo apt-get install -f': the components of the package got installed followed by google earth directly. Good for me because the update centre was having trouble up to that point & I thought I had broken my package system.

I recently upgraded from 11.10 to 12.04 and seamless mode no longer works correctly. I have re-installed guest extensions.\nThe problem is that the Ubuntu desktop wallpaper is shown, effectively blocking the Windows desktop. I can bring Windows apps to the foreground, but as soon as I bring any Ubuntu window to the foreground, all the windows apps will disappear, hidden by the ubuntu desktop even if I activated an Ubuntu window in a different monitor. So, it is not very much different from full-screen mode at this time. \nI suspect if I could turn off the Ubuntu desktop or wallpaper this would be a sufficient workaround (this is basically what Seamless mode is) but that does not seem to be possible within Ubuntu itself. \n[Jeremy doesn't specify system config, but I can confirm I'm seeing this behavior in Win 7 64-bit with both 32-bit and 64-bit guests.

You will need to shutdown or power off your virtual machine first.\nWithout it, seems to make it that the guest's background and all appears. It's basically full screen but with the host's HUD stuff visible.\nHost: Windows 7 64bit\nGuest: Ubuntu 12.04\n\nA: This appears to be a window manager issue. As a VirtualBox guest under Windows 7 Premium 64-bit, Ubuntu 12.04 64-bit has the problem mentioned: the Ubuntu background image remains displayed. Using Ubuntu 12.04 64-bit with the GNOME window manager (installed via Ubuntu Software Center), however, seamless mode works correctly. Using Xubuntu 12.04 64-bit (which uses the XFCE window manager instead of Unity), the seamless mode also works correctly. Thus only Unity experiences this problem.\nUntil the Unity team solves the issue, use the Ubuntu Software Center and type in 'gnome' and use it to install the GNOME Desktop Environment. At log-in time, click on the Ubuntu icon and select one of the GNOME choices [GNOME, GNOME Classic, or GNOME Classic (no effects)] for your session. Seamless mode works as intended.\nAlternatively, use the Xubuntu distribution. Seamless mode also works as intended.\n\nA: Power off the VM and then boot it back up and log back in. It will work.\n\nA: I installed gnome desktop, problem's still there. But this works to me: enter full screen mode --> log out ubuntu --> now full screen mode renders correctly and seamless mode back to normal.\n\nA: Upgrade to the latest versions. Using 15.04 and VirtualBox 5.0.2 (Windows host). That configuration works on my Dell M4800.\n\nA: Installing any desktop environment like xdm, kdm, lightdm and gnome makes things work.

Since GTK2 is so fundamental to all of Lucid applications, I would not recommend that you try to uplift your GTK version (it will require a major recompile of all sorts of stuff).\nYou cannot simply reduce those minimum version values - I've tried... the compilation will fail because the code requires the newer GTK libraries.\nIf you want a relatively newer version (v2.33) that will work with Lucid, can I suggest this ppa:\nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:transmissionbt/ppa\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get install transmission\n\nRun transmission-gtk reveals:\n\n\nA: You need to have the package libgtk-3-dev. \nOtherwise the compiling process will break with this message:\nconfigure: error: Package requirements (gtk+-3.0 >= 3.2.0\n                              glib-2.0 >= 2.32.0\n                              gio-2.0 >= 2.26.0,\n                              gmodule-2.0 >= 2.32.0\n                              gthread-2.0 >= 2.32.0) were not met:\n\nNo package 'gtk+-3.0' found\n\nYou just need to install it with:\nsudo apt-get install libgtk-3-dev\n\n\nA: Getting latest transmission-gtk to build and run on Ubuntu 10.04 is possible, but hard and cumbersome due to the gtk dependancy. Getting it themed right may also be messy. You might want to consider just going with the daemon, and control it with the webui and/or one of the many third-party rpc clients.

I am superadmin of a server and like to change password of an existing user .

Please note the new-password will be visible for users who can list the processes.\n\nA: The usermod -p flag is expecting the data to be the password already in an encrypted format.\nUse openssl passwd to generate the encrypted data, or do it like this:\nusermod -p `openssl passwd` (USERNAME)\n\n\nA: Something that should be added here is the following.  This method:\nsudo usermod -p `perl -e \"print crypt(\"new-password\",\"Q4\")\"` john\n\nmeans that multiple very similar passwords will ALL work.  For example, on Oracle Linux 7.4 server and Ubuntu 17.10 desktop consider:\nsudo usermod -p `perl -e \"print crypt(\"borkling\",\"Q4\")\"` orabuntu\n\nNow if one does:\nsu - orabuntu\n\nyou will find that ANY password that starts with borkling will work, e.g.\nborkling88\nborklingjars\n\nalthough borkline will not work which is because as stated previously any password that has \"borkling\" as it's prefix will also work when the password is set in this way.\nA way to to this that afaik does not have this unwanted side-effect is the following:\n(credit for these goes to \"Sandeep\" here:\nhttps://stackoverflow.com/questions/2150882/how-to-automatically-add-user-account-and-password-with-a-bash-script)\nOn RedHaty Linuxes:  (omit the \"-G wheel\" if you don't want sudo privs granted)\nsudo useradd -m -p $(openssl passwd -1 ${PASSWORD}) -s /bin/bash -G wheel ${USERNAME}\n\nOn Debiany Linuxes (omit the -G sudo if you don't want sudo privs):\nsudo useradd -m -p $(openssl passwd -1 ${PASSWORD}) -s /bin/bash -G sudo ${USERNAME}\n\n\nA: The reason it didn't work is because usermod's -p option expects the password to be encrypted already.\nFrom usermod's man page:\n -p, --password PASSWORD\n       The encrypted password, as returned by crypt(3).\n\nTo set a password in this way is not recommended.\nInstead You should use passwd <username>. This should (as usermod) be done as root (if you're not changing the currently logged in users password).\nTo change the password for user foo.\nsudo passwd foo\n\nThis will prompt for a new password.\nHave a look at the man-page for passwd for more info on setting for example expire time.\nGood Luck!\n\nA: Just type \npasswd\n\nIn this way normal user can change own password without root privilege if  you don't have. \n\nA: We can use commands mkpasswd and usermod.

I mean, is it running a script? What is it running?\n\nA: Your system then calls the command shutdown. Logins are prevented and all users are notified of the impending shutdown. The command has a parameter called TIME, which is how long until the shutdown occurs. When you use the shut down from the corner the argument is now.

If so, what is the solution? I am using Precise Pangolin, everything is updated to their latest verions.\nThank you in advance.\n\nA: Founnd this problem solved on the Ubuntu Forums site at this link\nTo summarise, in gnome-tweak-tool the keybinding theme was set to \"Emacs\" in gnome-tweak-tool. Switched it to \"Default\" and everything works.\n\nA: Had this problem with linux mint 17. The default key theme seems to be Emacs there, but almost no other tool than gedit care about that (which makes it look like a gedit problem, but it isn't. It's just that linux has become a config spaghetti).\nThe solution is twofold:\nthe key gtk-key-theme has to be changed from \"Emacs\" to \"Default\" in both GConf (the old config system of gnome) and DConf (the new one). You can access GConf via gconf-editor and DConf via the linux mint settings dialogs, or directly via gsettings.\n\n\n*\n\n*Open Linux Mint's System Settings -> Themes -> Other Settings. Here, switch the drop-down menu Keybindings to Default, and close the settings dialog. Don't ask me why this setting is in \"Themes\", and not \"Keyboard\". Brain fart.\nThis should have done it for gedit. Alternative route is using the command gsettings set org.cinnamon.desktop.interface gtk-key-theme Default\n\n*However, The gnome developers who made DConf aren't smart enough to synchronize backward compatible settings with GConf. So open gconf-editor (and this is what the gnome-tweak-tool mentioned in Tingting's answer also accesses) and navigate to desktop->gnome->interface. There you'll also find the key gtk_key_theme, which you now also set to \"Default\".\nThat should be it. What a beautiful example of miserable design and defaults (Emacs-keys as default system wide? seriously? Because Emacs users are so bad at changing configs to their needs?)\nAdding some keywords for google: gedit CTRL+F control F doesn't search find work moves cursor forward CTRL+H control H doesn't replace work deletes character\n", "Q: Display remains in sleep/suspend mode but machine is not in sleep mode First, this is not a Laptop, but a desktop machine. I am running Precise Pangolin. \nI often notice that, when I am away from my computer for a while (usually at least 15 minutes or so) and come back, the monitor will be black, and the monitor's power indicator will be orange rather than the usual green, so I just assume the computer is in suspend mode. But then I move my mouse, type on the keyboard, etc., and the display stays in the same state. The power indicator on the tower itself is solid green (On) all throughout this process. \nWhenever this happens, I end up having to push and hold the computer's power button to turn off and restart the computer. \nI have looked for similar questions, and the closest I can find are questions about laptops relating to suspend/hibernate mode. Does anyone know what could be going wrong?\nEDIT (5/21/12): This is happening less often now, but it still happens. My temporary solution is to force the machine to suspend anytime I know I'll be away for more than 5 minutes. It isn't ideal, but at least it keeps me from having to \"brute-force shutdown\", and possibly lose a lot of data, quite as often.\n\nA: it has something to do with your OS because the monitor doesn't have it's own time to start up, or your computer is slow on reappearing, so just check these things. by the way the monitor does take a while to reappear by not after about 5 minutes, it's the OS your running or the monitor itself.\n", "Q: Do I need additional graphics drivers win an Intel HD graphics 2000? I use both Linux Ubuntu 12.04 and Windows 7 on my Desktop which has Intel HD Graphics 2000.  Do I require additional drivers for the Linux operating system to use the HD graphics and if so, will these drivers effect how the windows OS operates?\n\nA: No, Intel Video drivers are provided out of the box with Ubuntu, there's no need to install additional drivers.\nThe system information dialog will not show the proper driver, see this question for more details:\n\n\n*\n\n*How can I get my graphics card to be recognized in System Info?\n\nA: Video Drivers are Operating system specific. So whatever driver you install on Ubuntu has no effect on your Windows installation. And vice versa.\nNow, you may not NEED additional drivers. Ubuntu may run smooth just as it is with the defaults. But if there are any available in the hardware driver manager. I'd say get them, as it will only improve performance. \n\nA: Ubuntu supports Intel HD 2000/3000 VGA cards without any driver installation. But it doesn't get listed in \"System Settings>Details>Graphics\". You should install mesa-utils to get it listed.\n\nsudo apt-get install mesa-utils\n\n", "Q: Asus 1018p dead after upgrade to 12.04 I was successfully running 11.10 and upgraded through the software update. Everything was running perfectly until i did a reboot. Now when i hit the power button the light comes on and the wireless indicator light comes on, but nothing else. I have tried to boot from usb, i have tried to boot into the bios, i have tried every hot key startup combo in the manual and i still get nothing... any ideas??\n\nA: In that case i would try to unload all memory by removing the battery and power supply for some time.\nSometimes a bad programmed ACPI is producing such bad results. You have to make sure, that the PC is \"forgetting\" everything. \n\nA: I'm worried that you can't even see a BIOS screen. That's not good...\nI know this may not be the best or most likely solution. But if you are familiar with how to handle RAM, take the plug and battery out of your machine, then carefully remove the RAM. Then place it back in. See if that does any good.  \n", "Q: Google Sinhalese installation failed I installed Ubuntu 12.04 3 days ago an have never used it before. I wanted to install an IME for Sinhala so I tried installing Google Sinhalese input via wine following the instructions from the community documentation on wine. At the last step the following error message appeared: \n\n\n*\n\n*\"Google installation failed with error 0x80040154\"\n\n*\"The installer could not connect to the internet.Ensure that your computer is   connected to the internet and your firewall allows GoogleUpdate.exe to connect then try again\".\nMy computer was connected to the internet, and I have no idea of firewall settings on Ubuntu, please guide me. Thanks in advance. If it is connected to firewall settings, be kind to advice me how to change the settings. Thanks.\nAlso let me know if there are alternatives.\n\nA: Ubuntu actually has an IME for Sinhala, you just need to add it via system settings -> keyboard layout.\nThere is also a translation team on launchpad that would be glad to welcome new members and could give you better advice on related issues.\n\nOn that wine issue\nYou got an error message from a windows application by using wine. Windows applications are generally unaware that they are running on wine and will assume they are running on windows and like in that case will make false assumptions for workarounds and solutions.\nThe default configuration of Ubuntu has two firewalls. The kernel firewall named Netfilter, which is not configured to filter anything by default as far as I know, and Apparmor an application based firewall which shouldn't get in the way of wine applications.\nWhat zetah referred to was the appdb on the WineHQ site, where a compatibility list of applications is maintained. Unfortunately you can't find \"Google Sinhalese\" there or variations there of. But what you can find is a reference to a similar error message of another application using the Google Updater. Searching for other Google applications, Google Music Manager seems to work, but trying to reproduce that with the Sinhalese IME installer in my VM did not work. Filehippo has offline installers for Chrome, but does not seem to have for the IME. \nSorry but without more investigation, you would not be able to install that application. Note: We are just talking about a file that needs to be fetched from a server, that's all there is, the rest of the installation process would run fine. It is a nuisance, but Google still insists on using this malware like installation process for their Windows software. They have been doing so or years.\n", "Q: Adding a network folder to Clementine library I have 2 machines running Ubuntu.

I installed b43-fwcutter and stuff but the problem persisted.\nThe problem solved by shutting down the SLA-driver that was on by default in Ubuntu and rebooting the laptop to Vista. When running Vista, the wlan led was on and blinked once in a while. I pulled the wlan switch so the wlan connection and the led turned off. Next I rebooted the laptop. And now, against all predictions, wlan worked on Ubuntu 12.04.

If so, you'll have to adjust the follwing command (for example /dev/sdc instead of /dev/sdb), else you just execute it from any terminal:\nsudo grub-install /dev/sdb\n\n"]
