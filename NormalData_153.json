["Q: Unable to change resolution back to normal After fixing the \"System runs in low graphic mode\"-error, the resolution of my screen changed to 640x480. Obviously, this is not my native resolution.\nI cannot set it to the native resolution (1366 x 768) for some reason, since there is no other resolution shown in the Monitor Settings. Arandr also does not show 1366x768 as a possible resolution.\nMy laptop is a Samsung R519 with standard resolution 1366x768, with an Intel graphic card.\nDoes anyone have an idea how to solve my problem? I hope I explained it clear enough (if there is some missing info, please let me know)\n\nA: This helped me, just for anyone who has the same problem: How set my monitor resolution?\nThe first answer, from BuZZ-dEE did the job.\n", "Q: How should I fix libraries that can't be found because of multiarch naming? I've run into this problem a few times now. I have some program that is looking for a library and can't find it, even though it is in /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu. \nMaybe this a flaw in the way the dependent program was written. I don't know much about this, but I would expect the dependent program to specify the name of the library, and let the system search a list of paths. \nCan anyone explain briefly how Ubuntu expects a properly behaved program to look for dynamic libraries?\nAs a concrete example, the latest case involves the libpcsclite.so library. The Oracle documentation suggests that Java (the dependent program) will look in /usr/lib64 and /usr/local/lib64 on my system—neither of which exist. I've had similar problems in the past with non-Java dependents. Part of my question is, why would a program list search locations like this? Is there a search mechanism provided by Linux that should be used instead?\nIs this a problem with Java, to be corrected by using its sun.security.smartcardio.library system property, or is pcsclite failing to support the multi-architecture naming conventions correctly? If the latter, should I be creating symlinks manually, or is this something a tool like ldconfig should fix?\n\nA: My guess is that the problem is you are installing packages outside of apt (apt-get). Either use Ubuntu packages (ppa if possible) or if you are compiling packages, as you compile, use ./configure --help and specify a library path as a part of your configuration.\nSee also:\nhttp://tldp.org/HOWTO/Program-Library-HOWTO/shared-libraries.html\nhttp://www.linuxquestions.org/questions/linux-general-1/using-a-non-standard-library-path-when-compiling-software-781185/\nFrom the second link:\nCFLAGS=\"-I/path/to/your/headers\" LDFLAGS=\"-L/path/to/your/lib\" ./configure --blah\n\nIf you need further assistance you will have to be more specific regarding \"some program that is looking for a library and can't find it\" - What program? How did you install it ? etc.\nTo set your java environment, edit ~/.pam_environment, add:\nexport JAVA_HOME=/usr/java/<your version of java>\nexport PATH=${PATH}:${JAVA_HOME}/bin\n\nFor all users (system) edit /etc/environment\nSee also: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/EnvironmentVariables#Persistent_environment_variables\n", "Q: Wireless won't connect! I recently installed Ubuntu onto my Dell Inspiron 1545 laptop.\nI can connect to the Internet via Ethernet, but wireless won't work.

The quick solution was to just put in the IP of my Wireless Router, then change it from AES to TKIP-AES.  This kept the other systems on my wireless happy, and suddenly Ubuntu took the password and connected me with a reported 72Mb/s connection speed.\nI couldn't do too much more since I was running from the DVD, making sure it works before I install.  I had seen suggestions of doing NDISWrapper and then rebooting - not gonna help with the DVD.  \nHope this helps anyone else looking.  Probably too late to help the original person posting, but maybe it will help someone else.  If you can't do TKIP-AES, try going from AES to just TKIP.

I'm pasting the answer below: \nRealtek is making the official Linux driver available unofficially (via Dropbox)\nSupport for the RTL8273AE-BT has been added by Realtek in the 92-series driver, version 0006.0514.2012. For unknown reasons, neither the Windows nor Linux drivers are available on their website (yet). But Realtek tech support has been providing a Dropbox link with the source code/firmware tarball which numerous users have reported as working.\nWhere do I get it?

For instructions for your version of Ubuntu, see https://help.ubuntu.com/community/WICD\n", "Q: Only Around 50MB/sec Max Network Transfer; had 70-100MB/s on Windows, Ubuntu reports Gigabit Speeds, Why? I have two different computers, one a desktop, the other a laptop. Both have different network controllers in them (one Qualcomm Atheros, other Realtek). Both using the included driver.\nBoth computers have Xubuntu 13.04 x64 currently, but the results are reproducible on 13.10 (with Kernel 3.10 and 3.11 daily) and 12.04.2, and Lubuntu 13.04. The results are also the same on the desktop if I use a compiled Realtek driver (8168 I think).\nIf I try restoring files from a backup computer, the transfer speed at a most goes around 50MB/sec, on both machines. Network information is reporting 1000 Mb/s.\nThe same computers under Windows can easily get 70-90MB/s transfer speeds while restoring backups.\nJust to be clear, I'm dragging some folders from a Samba share on another computer, to my desktop and laptop (not at the same time) using Xubuntu's file manager, Thunar.\nAny idea what's up?\n\nA: What's up? Samba, probably.\nBefore you try something else, test the network drivers with iperf -s on one and iperf -c other_ip on the second. Should show raw performance. You could see up to ~125MB/s but down to ~100MB/s would still be okay.\nAssuming that's fine, try another protocol. I suggested NFS to another user because it's a lot faster than Samba in my experience. My post there includes sample configuration to get you up and running a fairly insecure sharing scheme. If you need usernames and passwords, this can all be done, it's just a bit more work.\nIf you want to mix Ubuntu and Windows, I suggest you keep Samba hanging around for when you need to copy from one OS to the other, but it's going to be slow.\n\nThere are Samba tuning guides littered around the internet but I've never had much success in improving Samba-to-Samba transfer speeds. Here are the two biggest claims I've seen to date:\n\n\n*\n\n*Using strict allocate doubles write speeds. \n\n*Bigger buffers just generally help:\nread size = 65536\nread prediction = true\nsocket options = TCP_NODELAY SO_RCVBUF=8192 SO_SNDBUF=8192\nwrite raw = yes\nread raw = no\n\nThese two \"solutions\" are all over the place but as I say, I've never had much luck with either and given everything is Linux of some sort here, I just fall back on NFS for speed.\n\nA: I had the same issue (2,5-3,0 MBps) and solved this by adding this line to the config:\n[global]\n    ...\n    server signing = disabled\n\n\nA: First check the speed between the computers, as suggested by Oli.\nI found that I had to switch from 2,4GHz to 5GHz, before trying to optimize Samba.\nOn Ubuntu with Samba run:\niperf -s\n\nOn Client/Ubuntu/Mac run:\niperf -c IP_on_Ubuntu_With_Samba\n\nI got 40.2 Mbits/sec on 2,4GHz and 367 Mbits/sec after switching to 5GHz. I first run both on same server and got 72.5 Gbits/sec, so I knew something was wrong with the test.\nTo install on Mac: \"brew install iperf\"\n", "Q: Uninstall specific kernel version I recently upgraded to kernel version 3.8.0-27.

Neither boot! I'm trying to install Ubuntu on an E-series Vaio with windows 8 pre-installed.\nTo do so, first I shrinked windows 8 partition (using the windows software). Then I burnt a 64-bit Ubuntu 13.04 Live DVD. I disabled Secure Boot and Fast Startup (not UEFI).\nI had problems with the installation, as afer selecting the install option the screen started to flash and flicker. I solved it using nomodeset and installed it. I made an 8GB partition for swap (as that's my RAM capacity), a 20GB one for root and a big one for /home. I wasn't sure if I had to make any of those primary instead of logical, but the installation ended correctly.\nWhen I start now the PC, GRUB loads and shows me both windows 8, Ubuntu, and the Vaio system setup. BUT , if I select Ubuntu, it boots (I can hear the ubuntu welcome sound) but the screen flickers and flashes. I tried to use nomodeset, but that somehow starts Ubuntu in text mode (terminal). And if I choose Windows 8, it says that \"drivemap\" couldn't be found. \"invalid EFI file path\". The system setup boots correctly.\nI'm a n00b, and I'm really lost.

Three of these are:\n\n\n*\n\n*Use Ubuntu's Boot Repair tool. You'll probably have to run this from a live CD (like your installer).\n\n*Install my rEFInd boot manager. Do this from Windows and install the driver for the filesystem on which your Linux kernel resides (probably ext4fs) for best results. There's a slim chance that booting Ubuntu directly from rEFInd will fix your video problems, too, but that's not likely.\n\n*Edit the /etc/grub.d/40_custom file in Ubuntu and add an entry for Windows. Once this is done, type sudo update-grub to fix the GRUB configuration. You'll obviously need to do this from a text-mode boot or from a live CD unless you can fix your Ubuntu video problems first.\n\n\nSomething like the following will probably work for the final option, although you'll need to fiddle with the details, and particularly the (hd0,gpt1) bit:\nmenuentry \"Windows 8\" {\n    insmod part_gpt\n    insmod chain\n    set root='(hd0,gpt1)'\n    chainloader /EFI/Microsoft/Boot/bootmgfw.efi\n}\n\nAs to the Ubuntu video problem, there seem to be a lot of issues like yours of late, probably because of Linux video driver issues. Sometimes adding a hardware-specific kernel option will help, as oldfred has suggested; but I don't know the details of what's necessary on specific systems, and you haven't said what your video hardware is. As a generic fallback suggestion, the following might help (but don't get your hopes up too high):\n\n\n*\n\n*Add single to the boot options.\n\n*You'll get to a prompt that asks for a root password or to press Ctrl+D. Press Ctrl+D.\n\n*The system will give you a login prompt. Log in with your regular username.\n\n*Type sudo su to acquire root privileges.\n\n*Type cp /root/xorg.conf.new /etc/X11/xorg.conf\n\n*Reboot, and this time use the regular boot options.\n\n\nThis might not work right away, and in fact it's conceivable that it will make matters worse. If so, you can use a live CD to delete the /etc/X11/xorg.conf file. If this procedure doesn't help, or if it helps a bit but not enough to make you happy, you might be able to get it working by editing /etc/X11/xorg.conf. Unfortunately, editing this file is a complex topic. Googling \"editing xorg.conf\" returns lots of hits, but I have no specific recommendations for what site to read. If you take some time to learn, it's conceivable that you'll get it working. Broadly speaking, you probably want to eliminate all but the first Screen definition from the ServerLayout section, and play with which specific definition it uses (Screen0, Screen1, etc.). If you make progress but can't quite get it perfect, try posting another question or (better) post on a Web forum or on IRC.

It is a bug in the kernel that has been fixed upstream. Soon, with an update of your kernel, the error message will be gone.

As far as I know it doesn't contain any dependencies or sources.\nNote: I have tried PinningHowto, but  /etc/apt/apt.conf.d/01ubuntu is missing and I can't see where you set the default.\n\nA: I think that you were on the right track with pinning. I'm not sure if you need to be concerned about /etc/apt/apt.conf.d/01ubuntu. However, you should just be able to create it yourself if you really do need it. The apt.conf.d directory just gives you a place that you can add custom configuration directives.\nYou will probably be fine just following the steps for updating /etc/apt/sources.list and adding your package pinning information to a file in /etc/apt/preferences.d/99-file-name-of-your-choice. I think that adding the default release was just a precaution.\n", "Q: analogue to Windows combination ctrl+alt+del Combination Ctrl+Alt+Del in Windows calls Task manager.

I want to find out the standard for the deb file names. For example, I have file with the name foo_1.0.0-1_all.deb. As I have found out in Debian FAQ there is such convention:\n<foo>_<VersionNumber>-<DebianRevisionNumber>_<DebianArchitecture>.deb\n\nBut this is not a standard. It does not answer a lot of questions. For example:\n\n*\n\n*How long can <foo> be?\n\n*What are the permitted characters in <foo>?\n\n*What values can be in <DebianArchitecture>?\n\nIs there any standard that describes deb file name in detail?\n\nA: Well, as you said, the name foo_VVV-RRR_AAA.deb for a deb file is just a convention for naming .deb files, where VVV, RRR and AAA are the version, revision and architecture of the package foo.\nAlso, this convention is suggested (dictated) when building packages with debuild or git-buildpackage.\nIf you agree with this convention is ok, if not, you can rename your .deb files as you wish, but only by following these rules (in this case maybe you must to run dpkg --info <deb_file> to find a simple information that normaly you can get using the above convention for a deb file name).\nNow, as you can read at Filename - Wikipedia:\n\nThere is no general encoding standard for filenames.\nBecause file names have to be exchanged between software environments (think network file transfer, file system storage, backup and file synchronization software, configuration management, data compression and archiving, etc.) it is very important not to lose file name information between applications. This led to wide adoption of Unicode as a standard for encoding file names, although legacy software might be non-Unicode-aware.\n[...] Filename maximum length is not standard and might depend on the code unit size. Although it is a serious issue, in most cases this is a limited one.\n\nSo, if there is no standard for file names in general, I am almost sure that there is not a special standard for .deb file names. Or, if you are still confused, take the convention as a standard, and follow these rules.\n\nA: The Debian package names are defined in the Debian policy, section 3.1 The package name here, which leads to section 5.6.1 Source here. Note that it is expressly stated that the package name is used as the file name.\nUbuntu adds an ubuntuX version number on top of that. This is documented in the Ubuntu Packaging Guide section The changelog here. I'll copy it just to stay safe if the URL changes in the future:\n\nNotice that the version has a -0ubuntu1 appended to it, this is the\ndistro revision, used so that the packaging can be updated (to fix\nbugs for example) with new uploads within the same source release\nversion.\nUbuntu and Debian have slightly different package versioning schemes\nto avoid conflicting packages with the same source version. If a\nDebian package has been changed in Ubuntu, it has ubuntuX (where X is\nthe Ubuntu revision number) appended to the end of the Debian version.\nSo if the Debian hello 2.6-1 package was changed by Ubuntu, the\nversion string would be 2.6-1ubuntu1. If a package for the application\ndoes not exist in Debian, then the Debian revision is 0 (e.g.\n2.6-0ubuntu1).\n\n\nA: Here are some thoughts about naming conventions:\n\nIf you've used Debian for any amount of time, you might have noticed that Debian package files all follow certain naming conventions. Every Debian binary package should have a filename that follows this format: packagename_version_arch.deb, where \"packagename\" is the name of the package, \"version\" is the package version with major, minor, and revision numbers, and \"arch\" is the architecture for the package. <..>\n\nFrom IBM.com\n\nAlthough this one is for RPM, it has a pretty nice naming convention aswell:\n  name-version-release.architecture.rpm\nwhere:\n  \n  \n*\n  \n*name is a name describing the packaged software.\n  \n*version is the version of the packaged software.\n  \n*release is the number of times this version of the software has been packaged.\n  \n*architecture is a shorthand name describing the type of computer hardware the packaged software is meant to run on. It may also be the string src, or nosrc. Both of these strings indicate the file is an RPM source package. The nosrc string means that the file contains only package building files, while the src string means the file contains the necessary package building files and the software's source code.\n\nFrom RPM.org\n", "Q: setting PATH env variable not working I want to set Sonar-Runner bin directory in PATH in .profile directory in Ubuntu. \nWhen I execute echo $PATH it is showing the path that I set, but when I try to run sonar-runner.bat file using \n./sonar-runner -h`\n\nthe results i get are \nbash: ./sonar-runner: No such file or directory\n\nBut if I run the same command \n./sonar-runner -h\n\nfrom its directory, it runs just fine.

Okay, bear with me on this. I'm using a program called BFGminer, which hopefully you know is a bitcoin mining program. Anyway.

Then I figured out that some settings in Windows may prohibit internet connections in Ubuntu.\nI disabled Wake-On-LAN in power management in Windows 8, and now it works in Ubuntu.\n\nA: It seems that you do not have an IPv4 address.  To set this:\nFirst, open the terminal, and then type the following:\nsudo nano /etc/network/interfaces\n\nThis will open a file, type the following in the file:\nauto eth0\niface eth0 inet static\n    address 192.168.1.100\n    netmask 255.255.255.0\n    network 192.168.1.0\n    broadcast 192.168.1.255\n    gateway 192.168.1.1\n\n(Enter your own IP addresses instead the above.)  Or, if you do not want a static IP, just type the following lines in the file:\nauto eth0\niface eth0 inet dhcp\n\nSave the file (CTL+X, Y, enter) and restart the network service:\nsudo service network-manager restart\n\nHope this helps.\n\nA: I also encountered this on a dual boot after upgrading Windows 7 to Windows 10.

This fixed the shared partition and at the same time resolved the Ethernet connection issue.

Is there any configuration file to modify in order to enable the DISPLAY environment variable before apache2 makes the call to my cgi-script?\n\nA: \nWhy does Apache2 disable DISPLAY environment variable?\n\nApache does not disable it since Apache does not know a DISPLAY variable. DISPLAY is related to the X Window system. \nIf you want to set DISPLAY I would use /etc/rc.local.

I.e., it requires to also ask for sudo when using chmod or any other means to modify permissions. Is it possible to make something like this work? \n(complicated setup is fine as long as usage stays simple)\nThanks for any help. \n\nA: Running thunderbird as an admin user is a Bad Idea, especially since it is something that is often left running in the background. An attacker finding your computer with an admin-priviledged copy of thunderbird open could (for example) write a hostile script as an email, and use admin privileges to save it as text over an existing system executable.\nI would in general consider disk encryption (along with a fairly fast system lock time) adequate in this situation, but if you're feeling paranoid just don't keep local copies of mail.\n\n\n*\n\n*Disable saving mail passwords (or at least use a master password): Edit->Preferences->Security->Passwords\n\n*Configure IMAP accounts not to save local copies of messages (Edit->Account Settings->ACCOUNT->Synchronisation & Storage).\n\nA: Other solution to security is create any partition or file block encrypted, for example witch truecrypt you can create it, and move /home/user/.thunderbird folder to /path/encrypted/.thunderbird  and create a link intro /home/user/.thunderbird (in this case .thunderbird is a symbolic link: ln -s )\nI hope helper you.\n", "Q: Unable to remove a ppa I had recently added the stormcloud ppa (ppa:jolicloud-team/ppa) to my software sources - but it happens to be an empty source and whenever I try to install stormcloud or update my system it gives an error.

More information on the Ubuntu wiki.\n\nA: Well, I'm thinking that you're using the lxde desktop (Lubuntu) but maybe you're using Unity or Metacity or Compiz (Ubuntu). If you're using lxde, you can add startup items in the following fashion in 14.04 (might work in 12.04 but I've never used it, sorry):\nOpen the menu (the super [windows] key opens it in Ubuntu), click on Preferences > Default Applications for LXSession then click on Autostart. You can add startup items by typing in their path into the input field and pressing Add.\nIf you didn't do this already, then you will probably need to:\n\n\n*\n\n*Open Terminal: Ctrl+Alt+T\n\n*Type in:\ncvt A B C\n\n(Where A=the pixel width of your screen, B=the pixel height, and C=the refresh rate (usually 60 and also optional))\n\n*Then type in:\nxrandr --newmode D\n\n(Where D=everything that appears after Modeline)\n\n*Then type in:\nxrandr --addmode VGA1 A_B_C\n\n\n*Finally:\nxrandr --output VGA1 --mode A_B_C\n\nYour screen's resolution should be fixed. Now open a text editor (gedit or leafpad) and put in the following lines:\ncvt A B C\nxrandr --newmode D\nxrandr --addmode VGA1 A_B_C\nxrandr --output VGA1 --mode A_B_C\n\nSave it as resolution.sh wherever you feel like (/home/username/.config/autostart might be a nice location) and mark it as executable. Then put its path into the autostart field of the Default Applications for LXSession and click Add. Unfortunately, this only works for individual accounts and does not do anything for the login screen (I'm trying to find a solution for that right now...)\n\nA: The startup application can be found by pressing the Super or Windows key on your keyboard, and typing in Startup Applications then selecting the Startup Applications from the displayed icons.\n\nA: The only method that worked for me, was:\n\n\n*\n\n*Run the necessary commands to get the new mode through cvt and xrandr, explained here: https://wiki.ubuntu.com/X/Config/Resolution#Adding_undetected_resolutions\n\n*Paste them in a .sh file, like set_resolution.sh, as an example it would look like this:\n#!/bin/sh\nxrandr --newmode \"1920x1080_60.00\" 173.00 1920 2048 2248 2576 1080 1083 1088 1120 -hsync +vsync\nxrandr --addmode HDMI-1 1920x1080_60.00\nxrandr --output HDMI-1 --mode 1920x1080_60.00\n\n\n*Go to Menu -> Preferences -> Default Applications for LXSession -> Core Applications, and there, scroll down to Xrandr white block, it should be empty and add the path of the .sh file where you saved it.\n\n*Reboot!\nI'm Using LXDE9.0 with Openbox on an Asus's TinkerBoard.\nTried modifying the ~/.xprofile, autostart in /etc/xdg/lxsession, autostart of Openbox, xinitrc, and none of them worked for me. this is only for a session like said before, but it would do the trick faster than going on xorg.conf file that was the last option that I didn't try.\n", "Q: Change disk ssd.

You may have to format your hard drive completely (and you'll definitely have to reinstall Ubuntu).\n\n*Boot into Windows Diagnostics using the Windows Boot Disk (CD/DVD that you installed XP from) and try to repair the Windows boot partition. It'll overwrite GRUB, and you'll loose Ubuntu, but will get back XP. I can't help you with the specifics of how to do this as I've never done it ever myself, but it shouldn't be too difficult.\n\n*Now you have XP, go on and reboot it a couple of times. This ensures that it configures itself, and if any problem occurs with it, we'll have to deal with that before installing Ubuntu.\n\n*Now, follow this tutorial here. That is how I dual booted my Windows 7 system with Ubuntu 12.04. It's a similar story for Windows XP.\n\nIf that wasn't the problem\nIf that didn't solve your problem, or you set the boot directory, please provide us with more information and images of your problem.\n", "Q: Copy Arabic files, characters turn \"?\" I can write Arabic using Ubuntu, but now I got this problem:\nI copied some Arabic files (books and music) from another hard disk and all the names turned into \"??? ?? ?????.pdf\" what makes it impossible to use them. Imagine all your files have these names \"?????\"...\nRight now, I would have to open each file, look for the real name, then rename them one by one.\nAny better idea for this? Can I install any tool, then copy them again?\nThank you so much\n\nA: The problem is text encoding - the text encoding of the file system you have copied from is not the same of the target file system.\nI'd guess that the file system you have transferred from is a native Windows file system with file names in a localised encoding, and that the target file system is a Linux file system with UTF-8 filenames (UTF-8 should support most languages).\nYou probably want the convmv program (this is available from the Ubuntu repositories) - you'll need to work out what the source encoding of the file names is (should be in the list you get from running convmv --list, I'm not familiar with Arabic but a quick search suggests it's cp1256.)\ne.g. (and you may need to experiment a little with the options to get this right)\n# this should rename all files in current folder, recursively\nconvmv -f cp1256 -t utf-8 -r . \n\nhttp://www.j3e.de/linux/convmv/man/\n", "Q: Installed software back-up I have Linux Mint 15 Mate installed on one PC and I am currently updating it and installing necessary language packs, software, etc. After full set up can I back-up the entire system and restore it on another PC running same version of Linux (Mint 15 Mate)? Or at least restore all updated files and software? I am on limited Internet access and traffic is costy :(\nThanks in advance\n\nA: You can clone the entire system and then restore it on another PC, but it will completely replace the PC running the same version of Linux (Mint 15 Mate) with your cloned system. If that is something you want to do, see this link, which will guide you through installing and using gddrescue, which you can install with sudo apt-get install gddrescue.\nIf you just want to back up settings and installed packages, see this AskUbuntu question.\n\nA: You can perform:\n\ndpkg --get-selections > ~/Desktop/packages\n\nThis you create a list of the packages you have installed.\nThen:\n\ncat packages > sudo dpkg --set-selections && sudo apt-get dselect upgrade\n\nto install them back.

So I guess it was the restart that resolved these isssues (sic.).\nThe problem now is: when I log in as kitty in the terminal window on my main profile, the prompt appears such as my main profile's, with all the formatting (color/boldness), but when I log in as kitty her native bash prompts have standard formatting. Why?\nEDIT: as I've noticed there is also a slight difference in the content of prompt, the one on my main profile being followed by a $ sign and kitty's lacking the $ sign and being enclosed in square brackets.\nI switch between profiles using sudo login and exit in the terminal window. When I log in as kitty at the start of the system, in the terminal it switches between the colored (logged as my main user) and standard (kitty's) one. If at the start of the system I log in as my main user it colors both (kitty's and main user's) in the same manner.\n\nA: It looks like kitty's shell is /bin/sh. This is a shell that's intended for scripting, it doesn't support fancy prompts, completion, command line edition and other interactive features. Change kitty's shell to /bin/bash:\nchsh -s /bin/bash kitty\n\n", "Q: How many bytes in 1 block or 1 inode? I'm trying to specify the amount of disk space for specific user in my Ubuntu Desktop 12.04 LTS System. I manually configure disk quota by editing /etc/fstab and add 2 more option next to the defaults option at the fourth field (e.g. usrquota and grpquota).\nThen I use edquota command to specify the amount of disk space for my user\n$ edquota -u user\nAfter that, new screen has appeared and there are 2 kinds of size for specifying, e.g. blocks and inodes. I'm unaware of either. I only know the human readable size (e.g. KB, MB, GB and so on).\nI will be happy if anyone can tell me what does inode means and how much size does it cost? and how much bytes in 1 block?\nThanks.\n\nA: “Block” is used with several different meanings: sometimes it's a number of bytes that depends on the filesystem, sometimes it's a number of bytes that depends on the application. The Linux quota tool uses a block size of 1024 bytes or 1 kilobyte. So to limit a user to 50MB you would set their limit to 50000 blocks.\nAs for inodes, one inode means one file (including directories), regarding of its size.\nYou can see the current disk usage with df (in kilobytes by default, you can switch to k/M/G/… prefixes with -h or -B 4096 to show the number of 4096-byte blocks). To see the current inode usage, use df -i.\n", "Q: How can I open MS Word files in LibreOffice? I would like to just use Ubuntu from now on, I don't want to go back to windows unless I have to. The problem being, I have a few documents that I need to work on in Microsoft Word. Can someone give me directions on how to open them through Ubuntu?\n\nA: In this Wiki article, it says that Microsoft Office documents saved as a .doc or a .docx file can be opened in  LibreOffice. Therefore, you should be able to just open it. Just copy the files onto a flash drive and then in Ubuntu, double click the .doc or .docx file to open it in LibreOffice.\nEdit: When opening .doc or .docx files in LibreOffice, be aware that the formatting can be a little off in some cases, so sometimes when opening a MS Word file in LibreOffice it does not look as it was intended/how it would have looked in MS Word..\nThanks to Shaun for pointing that out.\n\nA: Open LibreOffice Writer, hit \"Open\" (or do CTRL+O), and navigate to where you saved the file.\nOr, just double click the .doc or .docx file.\nEither of those methods should be able to open the file.\n\nA: Copy the files from within Windows on a USB stick or put them on a network share you can get too from Ubuntu. \nOpen them with the \"open\" dialog inside LibreOffice. Nowadays LibreOffice will open .DOC (and .XLS) files without much difficulty. \nThe only thing LO can not do for you macro's. Those tend to be created in Visual Basic. \n\nA: This has been answered in exquisite detail here.\nYou can just boot into Ubuntu and open files by a simple double-click, and the only difference you'll ever notice is that you're using LibreOffice.\nAnd if you're truly nostalgic about MS Office, the above link will show you how to get that running on Ubuntu.\n", "Q: My monitor keeps going into sleep mode when it reaches the background just before you log in, after booting up I am using Ubuntu 13.04 and it works when I use an LCD television.

Have you gone into setup on the BIOS and verified that your hard drive is present and visible? Have you tried the \"Try Ubuntu without installing\" option? That should read the OS into memory and can help diagnose hardware issues. If you have no bootable partitions or if the drive just failed, then it would be hard to perform an install and it would just appear to hang. \nOne thing have also seen in the boot up sequence for the install is a long \"hang\" if too many peripherals are installed (external storage usually the culprit). Can you verify that no external drives are attached as well? That might take a while to start the install as it verifies the external drives as well.\nJust my personal experience though YMMV. Would not expect a failure to install these days unless you require the alternative Boot ISO due to some driver issues.\n", "Q: Uninstalled Ubuntu. Yet it works I've uninstalled Ubuntu.

I did not want Ubuntu 13.04 on my PC anymore. I was sick of dual-booting every time the PC starts, and I wanted to return to Windows as well. (My version is Windows XP MCE SP2). The mistake I did is that I simply used EASUS Partition Manager to delete the Ubuntu partitions. But what went wrong here is that, even when I did it, the GRUB keeps trying to load. It says that GRUB could not be found and finally ends up running GRUB Rescue.\nI cannot \"Repair\" my PC using the Recovery Discs (containing Windows XP MCE), it only gives me an option to press \"F\", which will format the HDD to re-install the OS.\nAlthough, the best part is that I can still log in to Windows. Because, when I boot from the CD's, it does not give me a \"Repair\" option, but only \"Format\" and \"Quit\". By using \"Quit\", it takes me straight to Windows.\nBut I do not want to keep doing this same thing every time I start my PC. Neither do I want to Format my Hard Disk. I have tried a few applications, like EasyBCD which do nothing. So I want a good solution for it.\nIs their any way to install MBR through Windows or maybe Ubuntu terminal? Even if i can't access Ubuntu again? And what after installing Ubuntu again. Any safe method to uninstall it?\n\nA: Here are the two solutions that have have worked for me.\nBoot Linux from a Live cd or usb and make sure you’ve a working Internet connection and type the following on the terminal.\n1. Solution\nsudo apt-get install syslinux\n\nIf the package got installed, use the following command to write the MBR:\nsudo dd if=/usr/lib/syslinux/mbr.bin of=/dev/sda\n\n2. Solution\nsudo apt-get install mbr\n\nIf the package got installed use following to write the MBR.\nsudo install-mbr -i n -p D -t 0 /dev/sda\n\nCommon for both\nReplace sda if you want to install the MBR to a different drive. Do not put sda1,sda2,  or sda3. Just put it as sda for the hard disk. Finally reboot and your Windows should boot.\n\nA: I have fixed the problem now. The solution turned out easier than I thought. It was rather a cakewalk, and I did not even need to use Windows Recovery Disc (which were not working in my case). Here is what you need to do:\n\n\n*\n\n*Burn an Ubuntu ISO image onto a USB Drive or a DVD to make a Live USB/DVD.\n\n*Boot into Live mode (\"Try Ubuntu\" option).\n\n*After it boots up, press \"Ctrl + Alt + T\" to bring up the Terminal.\n\n*Put these codes ONE AFTER ANOTHER.\n\n\n\nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:yannubuntu/boot-repair\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get install boot-repair\n\n\n\n*\n\n*After doing this, open the \"Dash\" (Search menu). It can be accessed by \"Alt + F2\"\n\n\n*\n\n*Search for \"Boot Repair\" (Although just entering Boot will give you the app).\n\n*Open it and select the only option (Recommended one).\n\n*Reboot. You will no longer get the GRUB Error after this, and will boot straight into Windows.\nYou can also do it with Ubuntu installed. In case you want to Uninstall ubuntu, first follow the above instructions, then after you are in Windows, install EASUS Partition Manager and delete the Ubuntu partitions (the ones that are NOT ntfs formatted)\n\nA: Did you see this?

Following the instructions provided by the Brother website, I was able to install the drivers (CUPSwrapper and LPR) for the MFC-255CW printer locally connected to the computer.  When looking for the drivers via the terminal, the drivers are found.  However, when I attempt to add the printer, Ubuntu searches for but does not find the drivers.  What am I doing wrong?  Has anyone experienced this same problem?  Are there instructions, other than those on the Brother website, for installing the specified printer?  Any assistance is appreciated.\n\nA: Here is a link for the drivers for the Brother MFC-255CW printer for Linux. I was taking a look at this AskUbuntu question and, although this refers to 11.04, it seems like following the answers mentioned in this question should get your printer working. You need to install both the LPR and Cupswrapper drivers in the link.\nAdditionally, there is an UbuntuForums thread that details how to do this. I would check this out if you want step by step instructions.\nWireless Setup\nYou have to go to http://localhost:631/printers in your browser to set up the printer for wireless because CUPS comes with this web interface to add the printer. Here are some general instructions for this:\n\n*\n\n*Click on your printer name, Administration and then Modify Printer.\n\n*Select your printer under Networked Printers, click Continue.\n\n*Enter the IP address for your printer, click Continue.\n\n*Select your printer name with \"Cups\" version.\n\n*Click Modify Printer and that should be it.\n\nEdit:\nThis will install only the LPR driver. While following instructions from the Brother website to install the CUPSwrapper driver, you will get an error. To fix this, copy the mfc255cwcupswrapper-1.1.3-1.i386.deb to another directory location and name it mfc255cwcupswrapper.deb(in other words, delete the version number). Going back to the instructions, change the terminal input from\ndpkg -i --force-all mfc255cwcupswrapper-1.1.3-1.i386.deb\nto\ndpkg -i --force-all mfc255cwcupswrapper.deb\nin order to reflect the new name of the driver file and Ubuntu was able to find the MRC255CW driver.\n", "Q: How do I make a shell script in Ubuntu Terminal? Now I don't know if that is exactly what it is called, so please forgive my bad terminology and correct me if I'm wrong, but I'm looking for a way to shorten this bit of code:\ngcc -o hello hello.m \\\n\n-I `gnustep-config --variable=GNUSTEP_SYSTEM_HEADERS` \\\n\n-L `gnustep-config --variable=GNUSTEP_SYSTEM_LIBRARIES` \\\n-lgnustep-base -fconstant-string-class=NSConstantString \\\n\n-D_NATIVE_OBJC_EXCEPTIONS\n\nNow to clarify, this code allows me to execute or build/run an objective-c program that I build. It took me awhile to actually find it as I was having errors with compiling objective-c in Ubuntu previously, but this code works. Now I don't mind typing it in every time if I absolutely have too, but I feel like there is an easier way.\nSo is there anyway I can shove this into a text file and save it as gcc execute or something and make it where I only have to type one line like:\n./gcc execute\n\nto run it and then just ./-name of obj-c file\nand it would run my program?\nNow I'm not looking for that form of method exactly, it's just an example, is there anyway to do anything like that?\nIt would make things much more convenient, any help is always appreciated!\n\nA: To answer part of what was asked:\nFirst of all I used 'myDemoScript' rather than 'gcc' because it gets confusing when you later invoke the gnu c compiler (GCC) from a script with the same name.\n\n1) First a basic way of doing it without checking the file name:\nvim myDemoScript    \ni (insert mode on)\n#!/usr/bin/env bash\ngcc -o hello hello.m  etc etc etc\nESC :wq\n\nchmod +x myDemoScript  (make the script executable).\nAfterwards you can just use ./myscript.\n\n2) If you use bash (or similar shells) you can use $0, $1.\n$0 will contain the name of the program (e.g. in my case \"myDemoScript\".)\n$1 will contain the first argument. \nSo If you invoke \"./myDemoScript hello\" then inside the script $1 will contain \"hello\"\n#$/usr/bin/env bash\necho started the script $0 with $# arguments\necho going to work on the file $1\necho compiling $1.c to produce the output file $1\ngcc -o $1 $1.c\n\n(For more details google on \"bash getopts\")\n\n3) To answer how I would do it: \nFor compilation jobs: use make.  \nMake is overkill for compiling a single c file to an executable, but it is a good tool to learn and you can use it for so much more. It is also very useful should you ever get a project with multiple files. Especially in the case of many files or files which take long to compile.\nvim Makefile\ni (insert mode on)\n\nhello: \n<TAB> gcc -o hello hello.m -I `gnustep-config \\\n       --variable=GNUSTEP_SYSTEM_HEADERS` \\\n      -L `gnustep-config --variable=GNUSTEP_SYSTEM_LIBRARIES` \\\n      -lgnustep-base -fconstant-string-class=NSConstantString \\\n      -D_NATIVE_OBJC_EXCEPTIONS\n\ndebug_hello: \n<TAB> gcc -g -o hello hello.m -I `gnustep-config  \\\n      --variable=GNUSTEP_SYSTEM_HEADERS` \\\n      -L `gnustep-config --variable=GNUSTEP_SYSTEM_LIBRARIES` \\\n      -lgnustep-base -fconstant-string-class=NSConstantString \\\n      -D_NATIVE_OBJC_EXCEPTIONS\n\nclean:\n<TAB> rm hello\n\nESC :wq (write and quit)\n\nWith this file in the same folder you can just issue `make hello'.\nMake will then search for the label hello in the Makefile.\nIt will check if it needs to build any dependencies first (none are used in or example), and then execute your compile command.\nI added the label *debug_hello* to demonstrate other options: E.g. building a debug version of the same program by adding the -g flag to gcc.\nThe clean is another nice example. Partially because it shows non-GCC functionality. Partially because it is very nice to have a way to clean things when you project grows to include dozens of files.\n\nMake can do much much more than what I just showed, but that is getting rather off-topic. I recommend some googling if you are curious.\n", "Q: How to install CodeLite on Ubuntu?

I'm running 13.04 stock. I use Cryptkeeper and Davmail for access to things. How to get the systray Whitelist back in Ubuntu 13.04 is the method I used to get it working.\nEverything was going swimmingly, then I decided to upgrade Bumblebee and Primus to try and get better performance in games.\nSince I was running the old version of Primus, I followed the directions, did a purge of that PPA, removed Bumblebee and then apt-get update, apt-get upgrade... you know, normal stuff.\nWhen I rebooted, Logon was off.

With newer versions of unity, the com.canonical.Unity.Panel schema (where the whitelist lives) is getting ignored. Rather than deal with the cat and mouse game with Canonical, I have hardcoded a global whitelist in my newer builds. Now, ALL systray applications will display, eliminating the need for the whitelist. As long as you are still using my ppa, just update and restart unity.

The time it took to get everything functional was quite substantial (I am extremely new to Ubuntu/Linux).\nHowever the install is a guest OS install on Oracle's VirtualBox.\nMost VPS's are not willing to assist me in this issue and instead it seems I will be forced to install one of their default Ubuntu installs (usually 12.04)\nSo... Let's assume I am forced to install a fresh copy of Ubuntu 12.04 on a VPS... How do I go about migrating my data / programs / configs.... everything from my home installation to the new VPS host... is this possible?\n\nA: Yes, this is very possible, and there are several paths you can take.  Even though your original machine is a virtual one already, you'll find that guides provided for physical-to-virtual conversions are very helpful - for instance, this one from Linode.  Other VPS hosts will likely provide at least one way to boot from a separate disk.\nIf you'd like to be more efficient with your local bandwidth, you can transfer a list of your installed packages, and have the remote host install them before sending your configuration files, presumably in /etc and/or your /home or /root directories.  You can send files to your remote server using SFTP, if it's running an SSH server daemon.  SFTP is encrypted over the wire, and  supported by various file managers like Nautilus and Thunar.\nNote: RSync will also use SSH/SFTP as its transfer protocol, so anything transferred by it will be encrypted as well.  Even if you don't use RSync, it's still a good idea to stop each service before copying its configuration file to the remote server.\n", "Q: How do I set a monitor resolution that is not available in the Display Settings dialog?

Otherwise, use the manual buttons on your monitor to do this.\n(7) Create an xorg.conf file\nIf you like the resolution settings, you can make them permanent by specifying this information in an xorg.conf file.\nPut the modeline from step 1 into the \"Monitor\" section.  You may replace \"My Monitor\" with a descriptive name for your monitor, as long as you use the same name in the \"Screen\" section.\nNote that the \"Device\" section is used to specify your graphics card/chip and the driver you are using; Identifier may be any name you chose, as long as you use the same name in the \"Screen\" section.  But you must use the correct driver name for your graphics card/chip on the Driver line.  You can use $ lshw -c video | grep configuration to get your graphics driver name.\nAlthough I have not tested this, it may be possible to exclude the \"Device\" section, as long as you also delete the corresponding Device line in the \"Screen\" section.\n$ sudo gedit /etc/X11/xorg.conf\n\nEnter information into the file, save, and exit.

This means only one version of mono is available on ubuntu. The version of ubuntu you have, will determine what version of .net is supported.\nFor example on ubuntu 12.04, only .net 4.0 applications will run, .net 2.0 applications will not run / compile by default.\nYou should also be aware that vb.net is not well supported in mono. c# is really the language of choice for mono. The mono runtime itself will run vb.net applications quite well but the compiler may not work. If you want to run a vb.net application on ubuntu you really need to build it on windows and then run it on Ubuntu.\n\nA: Check your config file for any attribute that tells the framework to be 4.0. Try using a lower framework. Mono Develop is not good enough in linux.\n", "Q: How to start vnc server on-demand (not on boot) I have a vps which has the basic xfce environment & tightvncserver installed.\nI would like to have tightvncserver automatically start whenever I initiate a connection to the port it runs on (in my case, 5901). \nI've seen posts about using inetd or xinetd to do this, but I've also seen lots of posts saying that (x)inetd is not included in Ubuntu for a reason, and that it's a bad idea to use it.\nAnyways, I'm looking for a way to auto-start tightvncserver whenever there's an incoming connection to port 5901, preferably with as few dependencies as possible\n\nA: I don't know why is \"bad idea using xinetd or inetd\". I checked both bug tracker and didn't saw any security issue.\nThat said, I will try to repeat what you already have found about configuring 'xinetd':\nxinetd is pretty straight forward to configure. It uses the /etc/xinetd.d/ directory to store all the per-service configuration, so you only need to create the configuration to start tightvncserver, a sudo vim /etc/xinetd.d/tightvncserver to create a file, then insert your configuration (this can be modified according to your needs):\nservice tightvncserver\n{\n        socket_type     =  stream\n        protocol        =  tcp\n        wait            =  no\n        ## I don't run a vnc server myself, but you should change this for the user your VNC service uses.\n        user            =  root\n        port            =  5901\n        server          =  /usr/sbin/tightvncserver\n        ## This allows access from anyone in the 192.168 subnet, if you want anyone, just do not add this line.\n        only_from       =  192.168.0.0\n        log_on_failure  += USERID\n        disable         =  no\n}\n\nThat's all. Now you should disable boot up of the tightvncserver in the rc-d directories.\nThere are more options you can add to this, but I shall leave that to the manual.\n\nA: Rather than try and use tightvncserver I would attempt to the same thing that @Braiam's suggested but with Xvnc instead.\nservice Xvnc\n{\n        disable = no\n        type = UNLISTED\n        socket_type = stream\n        protocol = tcp\n        user = nobody\n        wait = yes\n        server = /usr/bin/Xvnc\n        server_args = -inetd :1 -query localhost -geometry 1024x768 -depth 16 -NeverShared -once -rfbauth /root/.vncpasswd\n        port = 5901\n}\n\nYou can adjust where the password file lives by changing this bit above: /root/.vncpasswd. The permissions on that file can be squirrelly so you might need to make them chmod 600 .vncpasswd.\nIf you need further details take a look at the tutorial, 2. Launching VNC server using xinetd that shows many different ways that you can run VNC as a xinetd service.\nUsing xinetd\nThe entire commentary on not using xinetd is bunk. It's a perfectly fine service to use and just as everything else, you need to understand the implications of using technology X, nothing more.\n", "Q: Make Ubuntu 13.04 visible Windows 8 Network I have searched all over for this and have not found an answer that works yet.\nI am setting up a printer/file server that is running 13.04.

On my new computer, I didn't want to have /home on the system SSD but rather on the secondary drive which is a conventional hard drive. \nI followed these instructions for moving /home to the other disk: \nA: Move home folder to second drive (actually these specific steps) \nBut now I realize that the disk is NTFS format. \n\n\n*\n\n*Will running home from NTFS be a problem, or perhaps a performance killer?  \n\n*Can I convert the HDD from NTFS to ext3 (or ext4?!) without losing all the files, and how?\n\nA: You can't without some major tinkering with ntfs-3g, since proper unix ownership and permissions are not supported on NTFS by default.\n\nA: \nWill running home from NTFS be a problem, or perhaps a performance killer?\n\n\n\n*\n\n*Yes, NTFS does not understand Linux permissions. If you're using Gnome, then you won't even be able to log in due to permission issues.\n\n*dot files on NTFS are not considered hidden files and due to the lack of permissions -anyone- can change those files without having to worry about passwords. \n\n*Also read this: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NTFS#Linux\n\nDue to the complexity of internal NTFS structures, both the built-in 2.6.14 kernel driver and the FUSE drivers disallow changes to the volume that are considered unsafe, to avoid corruption.\n\nIf you want to do it like this you are better of with FAT. But WHY break the security of a Linux system? Why? \nA better way is to put /home on ext3 or ext4 and mount the directories from the Windows partition (in that case you can use NTFS though I still advice against it). This will not break the security model but you can still share all your personal files. \n\nCan I convert the HDD from NTFS to ext3 (or ext4?!) without losing all the files, and how?\n\nGParted can do this. But it is probably quicker to move all the files elsewhere and then format the disc and copy the files back.\n\nA: Well you can have some problems with ntfs as it does not mount automatically on ubuntu. You need to add an entry to /etc/fstab manually. \nThen when I come to think of it.. you could try to use it as home, but on the other hand ntfs is rather poor choice when you have alternatives like xfs or ext4, which will be faster and more stable on linux.\nAnd I think you won't be able to change the filesystem without backing up all your data on other drive. \n", "Q: How to restore filesystem-backup made by rsync? Running version 12.04, with Virtualmin/Webmin. \nI tried to remove all unnecessary linux-image files today, since the /boot partition was full. I followed a guide from Ask Ubuntu, but that resulted in a broken Grub, or something, probably because the command in the suggested guide removed more than it should have.\nAfter several hours I finally managed to install a new kernel image, and created a new Grub, but then I found out that all files in the directory /run were deleted and probably several other files/directories, that were related to those packages in that directory. I don't know how that could've happened, but I knew there was something strange already when I booted into the Recovery Mode, since I couldn't find any link to the symlink /etc/resolv.conf --> /run/resolvconf/resolv.conf.\nAnyway: I have a complete backup of my filesystem, that was made today with the rsync command (sudo rsync -ahe ssh  ..., options: --delete --exclude=.gvfs --exclude=/proc --exclude=/dev --exclude=/sys) .\nI tried to restore just the /run directory, without any luck.\nMy question is then: can I just replace all files on my server, with the files on my backup-location, with the same rsync command?

And the username that the user used to login with, has nothing to do with the files and folders when user is logged in (besides from the httpd file). \nWhat I mean is:\n\n\n*\n\n*User wants to access http://myhost.com/~user\n\n*Apache is looking into the config file, sees that the user is valid and can access folder\n\n*Checking if user have access to folder via group www-data in the folder: ~/public_html` if ok \n\n*User have access to the folder\n\n\nAm I right, or have I completely misunderstood the auth process?\nI mean. There must be some way to keep the auth user info and use it for the file permissions, so that Apache is using them on the inside of the file system.\nUpdate: \nI chosed to use another solution instead. I use OpenSSH on the server side, and changed the protocol to SFTP on the client side. Now everything works very good. The administration is also much easier now.\n\nA: This may be a solution: http://blog.olivier.coupelon.net/2008/10/apache2-webdav-userdir-based-file.html\nIt's not a good solution, but it does work.\n", "Q: I need to set resolution to 1600x900 On Displays I only have 1366x768, but I need 1600x900. I've installed the Nvidia drivers, but still nothing. I've tried using the xrandr --newmode \"1600x900\", but that doesn't work.\nHow can I set the resolution to 1600x900?\n\nA: Use cvt to figure out what the correct modeline should be.  You may need to specify the correct frequency for you monitor as well.  Also, ensure your graphics card and monitor actually support the resolution you want to use.  See How do I set a monitor resolution that is not available in the Display Settings dialog? to see how to use cvt.

I want to be able to launch the desktop when I'm trying to configure stuff (and can't use the command line), then reboot and not have it appear unless I tell it too to reduce the required resources during normal server operation.\nIs there any way to do that?\n\nA: I think that what you are looking for is for a light desktop that you can start whenever you want (based in your comments) and that you can stop when you are done. For that before it was recommended gnome, but now the way to go is lxde or xfce. Is up to you what to install:\nsudo apt-get --no-install-recommends install lxde-core xorg-core // If you want lxde\nsudo apt-get --no-install-recommends install xfce4 xorg-core // If you want xfce\n\nFrom there on, you should be able to use the startx command to fire up a Xserver session.\nFor a headless server\nFor a headless server the procedure is almost the same, just that you might have to use SSH+VNC tunneling if the server is a remote location.

actually support Xinput2.2 multi-touch protocol.\nSo lets get the touch screen working. \nlsinput\nYou'll probably have to download this one, once you've done that you'll be able to produce an output of all your generic input event devices providing input through the evdev layer. Get this output and write down the location of your Atmel touch device\nsudo lsinput\n\nevtest\nevtest allows us to check what events your device is pushing into the evdev layer. You'll have to download this one too and then run it on the device location you wrote down earlier\nevtest /dev/input/eventxx\n\nThe output of this will tell you what kind of events you're creating from multi-touch. For true multi touch you want to be creating events such as:\nABS_MT_TRACKING_ID\nABS_MT_POSITION_X\nABS_MT_POSITION_Y\n\nThese are your true multi-touch events, if you dont see these then you aren't going to be able to run Ubuntu Multi-touch applications.\nif you see the following events you're probably only simulating mouse movements.\nABS_X\nABS_Y\n\nMultiTouch Applications\nThere is only a handfull of applications that support multi-touch in Ubuntu. I'm not going to explain how to set them up and run them but i'll give you the names of some frameworks to do more research on.\nKivy - Supports multi-touch at the evdev layer. A Python application framework with many example apps and games\nQt - A large application development framework, has limited gesture support but allows development of rich touch UIs.\nlibAVG - Haven't really used this one but has a selection of great example apps you can run and play with.\nedit: Things may not work flawlessly, thats expected but these tools will help identify the issue. Post back the output of any of these commands and I'll help interpret them\n\nA: I find out how to map the correct the touchscreen to the screen correctly by using:\nxinput map-to-output <device> <output name>\n\nTo find the device id, use \nxinput list\n\nand to find the screen name, use\nxrandr\n\nI just have to find out how to trigger this automatically when the external monitor is connected. You can also make a little script to get the right device id and run the command.\nFor the click problem, I think multi-touch is recognized for me, I can use 3 fingers to resize and move windows, but even single click does not work sometimes for me. I tap to click, but it behaves as I've just moved the cursor, not actually clicked.

To get this access, iOS requires the app to be granted access to the location services, because some of those photos might have location information.\nUnfortunately, although the Ubuntu One iOS app doesn't ever access your current location, iOS requires that the location services be on in order to get that authorization, and remain on while it accesses your photos.\nYou may wish to enable location services and simply disable it for most apps. The iOS 6 System Settings > Privacy > Location Services screen lets you disable access for apps that have requested it, and for some system services.\n", "Q: How should I use Unionfs or similar in a computer lab to \"freeze\" /home? Lab computers need to be \"frozen.\" We'll be switching our XP lab of about 30 computers over to something else this winter, and I'm making a couple of proposals, one of which is LTSP, and another is an immutable live-like system, updated monthly.\nMy third proposal for them is a more traditionally installed system, but with tmpfs laid over /home using unionfs. RAM for some of these older machines is 1GB, so it occurs to me that I might be able to force a swap or other disposable, on-disk partition over /home instead of RAM, but I'm unsure how to proceed with this and my Google-fu is failing me. There's a lot of information out there, and tmpfs will use swap when it runs out of RAM, but I don't want the machine to die of swap death. Instead, I'd rather have the changes to the user's $HOME be written to swap directly instead of stored in RAM and swapped out. The partition would, of course, need to be reset between reboots.\nHow is this kind of setup possible?

Many touchpad gestures actually don't use any of the Ubuntu gesture or touch events and instead once a gesture is recognized such as two finger scrolling a macro or keycombination is performed.\nIn your case when the two finger scrolling is recognized then a mouse scroll event is propagated into the event device generic hardware driver, evdev.\nYou can use the Synaptics Touch input driver to configure your most touch pads and touch screens. When using Synaptics, you can alter the scroll speed by changing the VertScrollDelta and HorizScrollDelta located in the config file.\nsudo gedit /etc/X11/xorg.conf.d/50-synaptics.conf\n\nAnd then edit these two lines\nOption \"VertScrollDelta\" \"10\"\nOption \"HorizScrollDelta\" \"10\"\n\nNote: The higher the value the slower and more accurate the scrolling will be. This may seem counter intuitive to the standard mental model of sensitivity.\n\nA: I have a MacBook Pro 11.1 running Kubuntu 14.04. Synaptic is installed, but the X11 and Synaptic config files aren't in quite the same location as listed in mdoran3844's answer.\nHowever, based on this KDE forum post post here, I ran the following command, which worked on my hardware/software environment:\nsynclient VertScrollDelta=20 HorizScrollDelta=20\n\nIf that change works but isn't permanent, you may need to place it in something like your .xinitrc or another start-up script (or hunt down the config files listed by mdoran3844's answer).\n", "Q: Restore previous applications on restart in Ubuntu 13.04 easily? How to restore previous applications when I restart the computer in Ubuntu 13.04? This post (How do I save/remember last-used window position and size for applications?) is not in 13.04 and I actually tried to use what Lucio suggested in the post, (i.e. dconf -> org -> gnome -> gnome-session and click on checkbox), but it didn't work at all. Even if what izx suggested in the post works on 13.04 too, which I don't know it does, do I have to spend three hours just setting the functionality of restoring previous applications on? OS X offers it either on default, or force you to just three minutes work. Is it feasible to do such a minimal work and still get what I wanted? Sorry but I don't think it is worth three hours to just set restoring my applications on.\nThanks.\n\nA: I use CompizConfig Settings Manager to set my applications on specific workspaces on specific coordinates.

You might have to fight it, you might not.

It is also connected by network to a brand new i5 desktop computer running Windows.\nIs there a way in which I can install Ubuntu on a shared drive in the i5 computer and use it to run Ubuntu on the old computer?\n\nA: That's a good question. I can only guide you in the right direction here, as even I don't know the correct way to go about it. It sounds like you might want to do something like PXE booting (booting over a network). One caveat that I am aware of: it has to be a wired connection. Beyond that, I haven't really done much research on it as I've never had the need to do such a thing.\nYou have to set up the host computer really specifically as well. I believe it has to have a TFTP server installed to work at a bare minimum.\nI do know that you can use PXE boot to boot the Ubuntu installer, so I don't see why you couldn't use it to boot the whole OS. However, the installer runs totally in RAM, so you'd probably have to make some heavy modifications to Ubuntu to get it to run the full-fledged OS from a remote disk. Frankly, I don't even know that it's possible, but one thing I've learned in all my Linux years is that if you give it enough effort, anything's possible ;)\nI was going to suggest a VNC server, but more than likely you're going to be running Windows on the main machine and not Ubuntu, so that wouldn't work out very well. However, you could install it in a virtual machine and set it as if it's just another computer on the physical network. Then you can, say, boot an Ubuntu LiveCD/USB from the dead computer and connect to the virtual machine hosting a VNC server, effectively making your HDD-less computer a thin client.\n", "Q: Problem after removing Apache2 I've tried to remove Apache2 by :\nsudo apt-get remove apache2\n\nNext :\nsudo apt-get autoremove\n\nAfter that, on http://localhost still appears following text :\nIt works!\n\nThis is the default web page for this server.\n\nThe web server software is running but no content has been added, yet.\n\nWhy after removing Apache2 above text still appears?\n\nA: It's probably still running; try ps aux | grep -E 'httpd|apache'; if there is a process then it's because you did not stop it.\nIf it's not running see what is bound to that port by doing lsof -Pni :80.\n", "Q: Unable to fix broken package system After I (painfully) managed to install Skype on my Ubuntu 12.04 LTS, I'm experiencing since months ago a packages issue I cannot fix.\nHave a look to my last post in order to know what caused this issue: Install Skype on Ubuntu 12.04 LTS 64-bit\nIf I try to install system Updates the Update Manager closes unexpectedly stating that the package system is broken and throws the following error:\nThe following packages have unmet dependencies:\n\ngrub-efi-amd64: Depends: grub2-common (= 1.99-21ubuntu3.9) but 1.99-21ubuntu3.10 is installed\n                Depends: grub-efi-amd64-bin (= 1.99-21ubuntu3.9) but 1.99-21ubuntu3.10 is installed\n\nIf I run sudo apt-get -f install in order to fix potential packages issues I get the following:\nReading package lists...

Yes, I know it's a kernel ;)\nI saw this file when I was looking through the 64-bit ISO's of 13.04. I'm working on remixing them onto my flash drive. However, I want my remix to have an updated kernel compared to that of the CD. This means that I will have to make a vmlinux.efi.\nOf course, to be able to make one means I have to know what it is.\nIs it simply a plain old 64-bit kernel?\nIs it, perhaps, an EFI boot stub?\nThe boot stub aspect doesn't make sense because it's loaded from GRUB in EFI, and isn't even located in EFI/BOOT. Maybe it's just future-proofing if it is an EFI boot stub?\nAn article I found on the community wiki said something along the lines of \"it's called vmlinuz.efi\" because it's 64-bit. That, too, seem a little weird. I mean, it helps to differentiate but a better name could have been chosen if it's not EFI bootable.\nOne thing that I find odd is that Isolinux and GRUB both load it in the same way as if it were just a kernel... so its actual purpose is a little mysterious. Can EFI boot stubs be loaded as normal kernels as well?\nWell, the fact of the matter is that I can find no discussion about why this filename was chosen and what exactly it is. So, here's hoping that someone here knows what this is and how it works.\nEDIT:\nInfo/MD5's of all kernels from Ubuntu, Kubuntu, Xubuntu, and Lubuntu CD's:\nDISTRO: lubuntu\nvmlinuz: Linux kernel x86 boot executable bzImage, version 3.8.0-19-generic (buildd@allspice) #29-Ubuntu SMP Wed Apr 17 18, RO-rootFS, swap_dev 0x5, Normal VGA\ndeacc3c3a21beb4913c43a00bb6d5e01  vmlinuz\nDISTRO: kubuntu\nvmlinuz: Linux kernel x86 boot executable bzImage, version 3.8.0-19-generic (buildd@allspice) #29-Ubuntu SMP Wed Apr 17 18, RO-rootFS, swap_dev 0x5, Normal VGA\ndeacc3c3a21beb4913c43a00bb6d5e01  vmlinuz\nDISTRO: xubuntu\nvmlinuz: Linux kernel x86 boot executable bzImage, version 3.8.0-19-generic (buildd@allspice) #29-Ubuntu SMP Wed Apr 17 18, RO-rootFS, swap_dev 0x5, Normal VGA\ndeacc3c3a21beb4913c43a00bb6d5e01  vmlinuz\nDISTRO: ubuntu\nvmlinuz.efi: Linux kernel x86 boot executable bzImage, version 3.8.0-19-generic (buildd@allspice) #29-Ubuntu SMP Wed Apr 17 18, RO-rootFS, swap_dev 0x5, Normal VGA\n1919b5acd184538ecb978f6361f98bf1  vmlinuz.efi\n\nThe one from the Ubuntu ISO is clearly different. I'm beginning to think it must be an EFI boot stub kernel... but still haven't found anything to confirm or deny it.\n\nA: The EFI stub loader is a component of the kernel, not a separate program. When the EFI stub loader is included in the kernel, that kernel file looks like a normal EFI program to the EFI, but it's still a normal kernel that can be loaded by the usual Linux boot loaders -- GRUB, LILO, ELILO, SYSLINUX, etc. The EFI stub has been available since kernel 3.3.0, and AFAIK, all Ubuntu kernels built since then have included this feature.\nThere's no law that says that kernels with EFI stub loaders have to have filenames that end in .efi. In fact, the kernels installed to the hard disk lack the .efi filename extension; this seems to be unique to the kernel on the installation disc, at least in Ubuntu. The EFI shell won't run a program unless it has a .efi extension, though. Thus, giving the kernel that filename provides one means of recovery and testing for advanced users that might otherwise be unavailable to them -- namely, manually launching the kernel from an EFI shell. I can't be sure, but I suspect that the Ubuntu developers are now naming their kernels in this way to provide this backup means of launching the kernel, or perhaps just to signify that it does contain EFI stub support. OTOH, the 32-bit Ubuntu installation disc's kernel lacks the .efi extension, but it does include EFI stub support. My suspicion is that the Ubuntu developers just aren't naming their kernels consistently.\nIt's possible to launch an EFI application (such as a Linux kernel with EFI stub support) from any location on the disk. The \"casper\" subdirectory is not a location where boot loaders normally reside, but it is possible to launch EFI programs from there.\nWhatever source you read that says the 64-bit kernel has a .efi extension because it's a 64-bit kernel is wrong. In practice, the 32-bit version of Ubuntu has a kernel that lacks this extension, so there is a correlation in the Ubuntu world, but there's no causation involved. In Linux generally, a .efi extension does not indicate a 64-bit kernel -- there are plenty of 64-bit kernels that lack this extension, and it may be desirable to name a 32-bit kernel with that extension on a 32-bit UEFI-based computer (although Ubuntu doesn't do so). That filename extension simply identifies an EFI application, which can be 32-bit (x86/IA-32), 64-bit (x86-64/AMD64), or some other architecture (ARM or Itanium).\n", "Q: OpenGL runs on very low framerate with a intel graphic card I got two systems which are almost identical but with slightly different graphic cards:\nSystem A\nproduct: N10 Family Integrated Graphics Controller\nvendor: Intel Corporation\ndriver: i915\n\nSystem B\nproduct: Atom Processor D2xxx/N2xxx Integrated Graphics Controller\nvendor: Intel Corporation\ndriver: gma500\n\nI know that both are not known to give the best performance, but System B is very slow.

So what is the way that I have to handle to backup my data.\n\nA: You either don't have permission to read the old data or permission (or the correct mount options) to write to wherever you're trying to rescue this data to.\nThe simplest method here would be to just AltF2 and run pkexec nautilus. That should give you root access to everything and then you can sort the permissions out when you've restored that data somewhere.\nIf you just can't write to the place you're trying to backup, open a terminal and run mount to see how it's mounted. If it's got ro instead of rw in its mount options, there's the problem.

My laptop configuration is Intel core i5 3rd generation processor, 8GB RAM, 2GB Nvidia GeForce graphics, 500GB hard disk.\n\nA: The only thing which you may have problems with is the Graphics Card, it will most likely work, however you may need to play with the drivers and select a different one from the System Settings> Updates and files>Other Drivers\nor from the Terminal:\nsoftware-properties-gtk --open-tab=4\n\nI suggest if there are options here to change the driver, that you choose the latest version first and work downwards until you find one that works well with your setup.\n", "Q: How to Restore photos on SD card I deleted 40 some photos from my SD card in my camera.  I thought I saved them on my desktop.  Using 12.04 LTS.  Is there a way to restore the photos??  My wife is pissed.  Nothing has been over written on the card.\nThanks\n\nA: TestDisk / PhotoRec\nYes, use the tool photorec; you'll be able to recover pretty much any file.\nYou should make sure that the SD card is read only as writing to it can corrupt any possibility of recovering data.\nIn Ubuntu, open a terminal and run:\n$ sudo apt install testdisk\n$ sudo photorec\n\n", "Q: Can the folder have no name in Ubuntu ? I have a folder in my system with no name in it. It is empty.

But I could not do it.\nAny idea, how can it be achieved? \nOn the same topic, how to access that folder in the shell?\n\nA: Accourding with these Rules For Naming File And Directory Names, no, it can't have no name, but can be named with one or more space/blank characters:\n\n\n\nFrom the above picture you can deduce that you can access a directory having only a space in the name with: \ncd ' '\n\n", "Q: I can't seem to close byobu splits using alt f5 I am using byobu with tmux and I am trying to collapse the 4 splits I have on the window, but it is not responsive. \nWhen I press alt+F5 nothing happens. \nHow do I collapse the splits in this situation?\n\nA: I believe the hot key you're looking for is Ctrl-F6.\nFull disclosure: I am the author and maintainer of Byobu.\n", "Q: Middle-click and drag doesn't trigger auto scrolling I've just came from a Windows system (in fact, I'm dual booting Ubuntu 12.04 and Win7), and in my Firefox installation back then, when I pressed the middle mouse button (mouse wheel), it displayed a circle that I could move the pointer away from to navigate around the page in a 2-dimensional scrolling. In Ubuntu's Firefox, I don't see this behaviour. Is there a way to enable this feature? I beleive it would require a different version of Firefox, because when I search middle in about:config, ot only has \nmiddlemouse.scrollbarPosition;true\nmiddlemouse.paste;true\nmiddlemouse.openNewWindow;true\nmiddlemouse.contentLoadURL\nbrowser.tabs.opentabfor.middleclick;true\n\nI'm using the canonical release 23.0, by the way.\nEDIT: Downloaded a clean install from firefox.com and nothing changed. Maybe it's a system bug?\n\nA: It's not a system bug, just one of the ways things are different on Ubuntu (and Linux in general) compared to Windows. Middle-click is used to paste from the xclipboard -- this is distinct from the Ctrl+C/Ctrl+V clipboard you are probably used to. Any text you highlight with your mouse will be available to paste by middle-clicking.\nThis may not sound useful at first, but it really is -- middle-click paste is one of those small things that I really miss when I have to use Windows.\nThis is handled by Ubuntu rather than any individual program, so using a different version of Firefox won't help you. I'm sure it is possible to enable the behaviour you're describing, but it would probably be quiet a lot of effort.\n\nA: The function you describe is called 'autoscroll' and it's an option you can enable in Firefox. Check the preferences menu, it's in there.\n", "Q: Unable to install Skype in Ubunutu 12.04 I downloaded Skype for Ubuntu from here. I tried to install it with the command sudo dpkg -i skype-ubuntu-precise_4.2.0.11-1_i386.deb but the installation failed.

The problem being discussed there was about Skype malfunctioning after an update. But in my case, I couldn't even install Skype properly.\n\nA: The error is caused by dependency problems (absence of some packages which skype requires for it to be installed). The following lines that were displayed confirm this:\nskype depends on libqtwebkit4 (>= 2.2~2011week36); however:\n  Package libqtwebkit4 is not installed.\nskype depends on libxss1; however:\n  Package libxss1 is not installed.\ndpkg: error processing skype (--install):\n  dependency problems - leaving unconfigured\n\nTherefore, it is obvious that the error can be overcome by installing the missing packages (libqtwebkit4 & libxss1). To install these packages, \n\n\n*\n\n*Open the Terminal.\n\n*Type sudo apt-get install libqtwebkit4 to install the libqtwebkit4 package.\n\n*Type sudo apt-get install libxss1 to install the libxss1 package.\n\n*After installing the required packages, continue with the process of installing skype with the command sudo dpkg -i skype-ubuntu-precise_4.2.0.11-1_i386.deb\n\nA: you can install skype using command line by:\nwget -O skype-NoobsLab.deb http://download.skype.com/linux/skype-ubuntu-lucid_4.2.0.11-1_i386.deb\n\nsudo dpkg -i skype-NoobsLab.deb\n\nsudo apt-get -f install\n\nFor 64Bit\nTerminal Commands:\nsudo dpkg --add-architecture i386\n\nsudo apt-get install ia32-libs\n\nsudo apt-get update\n\nwget -O skype-NoobsLab.deb http://download.skype.com/linux/skype-ubuntu-lucid_4.2.0.11-1_i386.deb\n\nsudo dpkg -i skype-NoobsLab.deb\n\nsudo apt-get -f install;rm skype-NoobsLab.deb\n\nAfter all of this run in terminal      \nsudo apt-get install sni-qt:i386\n\nThis will restore the skype contact window\n\nA: sudo add-apt-repository \"deb http://archive.canonical.com/ $(lsb_release -sc) partner\"\nsudo apt-get update \nsudo apt-get install skype\n\n", "Q: How get Join.me in Ubuntu? I'd like to know if there's any way of getting join.me to work in Ubuntu? I'm not looking for a similar software. I need it to be join.me.\n\nA: There may not be much hope with Join.me of a good cross-platform presentation solution.  \nFor over a year Linux support has been the second-most-popular request on the official join.me Ideas Forum and there are over 1800 votes for the idea:\n\n\n*\n\n*Make a version compatible with Linux/Ubuntu 12.04 – join.me forum and faq.\n\n\nBut join.me does not seem to even be willing to comment on the thread.\nAlternatives\nBut there are many alternatives. According to comments there, WebEx, Mikogo and Yuuguu support presenting from Linux, and others mentioned are Tightvnc, BigBlueButton and TeamViewer.\nUpdate: And of course now add to the list: Jitsi Meet, Zoom, Hangouts Meet, Skype, and many others which use standardized web technologies and are highly cross-platform.\n", "Q: Custom install of PHP I have always used the code below to install my PHP environment:\nsudo apt-get install -qqy php5 sqlite php5-gd php5-sqlite libapache2-mod-php5 libapache2-mod-auth-mysql php5-mysql php5-intl php5-curl\n\nHowever I can no longer do this as the latest version of PHP in Ubuntu 13.04 is PHP 5.4.9.  This version has the known bug #63379 that basically destroys the logout handler from the Symfony Security Component.\nI know I've got two options: install via adding a custom PPA (this post has all the details on that: How do I install different (upgrade or downgrade) PHP version in still supported Ubuntu release?) or via script.\nSeeing as this is needed for a server that my company uses I simply won't be prepared to add these private PPAs due to security risks.  But rather I would like to create a script to install any version of PHP and the above packages (sqlite, curl, etc) I normally install in one easy step via apt-get install. \nDoes anybody have a custom script that covers all the above mentioned packages?  Also is there anything else I should watch out for via the script method for installing PHP?\n\nA: In terms of trust, I'd struggle to find a PPA I trusted more than Ondřej Surý's PHP PPA. He's on a lot of official packaging teams. If he wanted to sneak something onto your system, he wouldn't need to resort to a PPA to do it.\nI'd be more concerned with the underlying stability of PHP but if you're building from source, you're likely going to hit those problems by yourself.\n", "Q: Lubuntu: .desktop shortcut works on the desktop, but doesn't from the menu I've created a simple shortcut.desktop in my Lubuntu 13.04 /usr/share/applications:\n[Desktop Entry]\nType=Application\nName=shockwave\nIcon=/home/zane/Pictures/Evil Decepticons.png\nExec=/home/zane/Documents/Zane_Shockwave-RDP.sh\nTerminal=true\nMimeType=text/plain\nCategories=GTK;WebBrowser;Network\n\nThe pointed sh contains just echo \"it works\".\nIf I double-click the .desktop it directly, the script runs and everything works as expected.\nBut if I click the menu entry from the desktop, I just get a \"stuck\", non-inputable Terminal.\nNote: to workaround this bug https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/pcmanfm/+bug/975152/comments/14 I've just \"lxterminal\" under PCManFM -> Prefernces -> Advanced, otherwise I can't run .sh at all.\nAny ideas?\nEdit I also tried these variant, but I always get the same result:\nExec=sh /home/zane/Documents/Zane_Shockwave-RDP.sh\nExec=lxterminal /home/zane/Documents/Zane_Shockwave-RDP.sh\n\n\nA: As suggested here, right-click and open the \"Panel Settings\"-dialog -> Advanced, then set \"Terminal Emulator\"=\"lxterminal\" and now it works.\n", "Q: How to compile and install DNScrypt Apparently there are no .deb packages available for installing DNScrypt.

How do I get dnscrypt installed?\n\nA: I bet you forgot a the libsodium library:\nchecking for library containing sodium_init... no\nconfigure: error: libsodium not found\n\nQuoting installation guide:\n\nInstall libsodium. There might be a pre-built binary package for your operating system already.\n\nUnfortunally, there are not libsodium packages for Ubuntu. So, you should download, build and install libsodium as follows:\n\n\n*\n\n*Download the newer tar archive from https://download.libsodium.org/libsodium/releases/ (you can also get the git repository from https://github.com/jedisct1/libsodium).  If you downloaded the tar.gz file, you should verify the hashsum:\n$ dig +dnssec +short txt libsodium-0.4.2.tar.gz.download.libsodium.org\n\"1a7901cdd127471724e854a8eb478247dc0ca67be549345c75fc6f2d4e05ed39\"\n$ shasum -a 256 libsodium-0.4.2.tar.gz\n1a7901cdd127471724e854a8eb478247dc0ca67be549345c75fc6f2d4e05ed39  libsodium-0.4.2.tar.gz\n\nAs we can see, both are identical. You can also use the .sig file.\n\n*Follow the ritual:\ntar xzf libsodium-0.4.2.tar.gz\ncd libsodium-0.4.2/\n./configure\nmake && make check && sudo make install\n\nYou should consider debianize the package so it's more easy for you to uninstall/update later. There are plenty guides about this.\n\n*Once you have installed you have to reload/rebuild the GNU linkers. A simple sudo ldconfig is enough.\n\n*Now run ./configure and it should generate the makefile. (I'm assuming you have at least build-essentials package installed).\nchecking for library containing sodium_init... -lsodium\n.....\nchecking that generated files are newer than configure... done\nconfigure: creating ./config.status\nconfig.status: creating Makefile\nconfig.status: creating config.h\nconfig.status: executing depfiles commands\nconfig.status: executing libtool commands\n\nThose are the ending lines of the ./configure.\nRemember to keep a keen eye on the updates and bugs for both packages, since there might be vulnerabilities that shall be fixed with hassle.\n\nA: Actually, the problem is that the instruction on dnscrypt.org are actually wrong. Prior to doing ./configure you have to do ./autogen.sh.\n\n\n*\n\n*./autogen.sh\n\n*./configure.sh (with libsodium installed as above. Hint: sudo apt-get install checkinstall)\n\n*make\n\n*sudo checkinstall\n\nA: For anyone receiving a similar error in the future, it could be the case that you do not have libsodium-dev installed. Installing it will allow dnscrypt to compile successfully. Of course, the easier route is to use the dnscrypt-autoinstall script.\n", "Q: Customize in Libre Office 4.1 on Ubuntu 13.04 I am running Libre Office 4.1 on Ubuntu 13.04 and I would like to make some macros to automate some monotonous tasks.

I've already tried that but it seems that it never updates so I'm stuck in the wrong time.\n\nA: It sounds like you are in a timezone 3 hours separate from UTC, and Windows and Linux are disagreeing about what time should be stored in the BIOS.\nLinux stores time as UTC in the BIOS clock.\nWindows stores time as local time.\nSo whenever you boot Windows, it resets the BIOS clock to local time, Linux loads it and assumes it's UTC.\nI was under the impression that the Ubuntu installer would detect Windows and set Linux to compromise by using local time in the BIOS... but this may not be true, or may not have happened correctly.\nThere are two solutions : \n\n\n*\n\n*Set Windows to use UTC in the BIOS clock\n\n\nThis apparently has some caveats for \"professional\" usage but might be satisfactory from a user POV.\nhttps://superuser.com/questions/185773/does-windows-7-support-utc-as-bios-time\n\n\n*\n\n*Set Linux to use local time in the BIOS clock\n\n\nSet the UTC setting in /etc/default/rcS to \"no\" (on Ubuntu)\n\nA: To avoid this, change time to manually instead of Automatically from the internet\n\n\nTry this:\nRemove/Purge ntp\nRemove/Purge ntpdate\nInstall ntpdate\nset UTC=yes in /etc/default/rcS\nreboot\nsudo ln -f -s /usr/share/zoneinfo/Europe/Helsinki /etc/localtime\n\n\nA: This question is really old, but the answer that worked for me isn't listed so here it goes:\nIn the terminal:\ntimedatectl set-local-rtc 1 --adjust-system-clock\n\nand then to check that it was successful:\ntimedatectl\n\nIt should give you a warning, because it is not preferred.

Thanks for any hints.\n\nA: Since parted is reporting the disk as being 2000GB, blanking the partition table is unlikely to help. (Those size reports are based on the size of the hardware and are unrelated to what's in the partition table.) It's more likely that something has set the Host Protected Area (HPA) for the disk, thus limiting its apparent size. You can adjust this with the Linux hdparm command, and in particular its -N option. (Type man hdparm and search on -N to find the details.) Typing sudo hdparm -N /dev/sde will report the current HPA status without changing it, so try that as a diagnostic.\nAnother possibility is that there's something wrong in the disk hardware or software stack. Your parted output indicates that you've got a WD My Book 1140. A Web search on this suggests that this is an external hard disk. Sometimes they can be problematic because of USB stack problems. Usually, though, such problems are issues with the firmware in the enclosure -- if the enclosure has a 32-bit limit on sector numbers, it will do weird things to the apparent size of the disk. In this case, though, it would be shocking if WD were to ship inadequate firmware with an over-2TiB disk, so this is plausible only if you've replaced the disk in the enclosure with a larger model yourself. Still, there could be a problem somewhere along these lines, especially if you're using an unusual USB adapter or something like that. It might be worth describing your hardware in more detail (both the drive and the motherboard or whatever type of adapter to which it's connected).\nOne more diagnostic to try is gdisk: Launch gdisk on the disk, type p, v, and then q to quit. Post the complete results. It's unlikely that this will provide any big clues, but there's an off chance that it will do so. You may need to install gdisk first (it's in either the gdisk or gptfdisk package; I don't recall which name Ubuntu uses, offhand).\n\nEdit: Your hdparm -N output is weird. Perhaps the enclosure's firmware isn't passing through that feature correctly. OTOH, the output does indicate that HPA is active, so it might be worth digging into that further with other utilities. (Maybe something Windows-based from the disk's manufacturer would fare better, especially if the disk is odd in some way.)\nThe gdisk output doesn't provide any new clues, although I did notice something I hadn't the first time around: The disk uses 4096-byte logical sectors. This means that you could use MBR on the disk, despite its size. (With 4096-byte sectors, MBR's limit goes up to 16TiB.) Using MBR isn't likely to help you because of the underlying problem that Linux is mis-detecting its size, though.\nI have a few suggestions for things to try now:\n\n\n*\n\n*Return the disk and get another one, if it's new enough.\n\n*Contact the manufacturer for tech support.\n\n*Try the disk with Windows and/or OS X. This will give you information about whether the problem is OS-specific.\n\n*Try another Linux distribution or another kernel. This might help if there's a Linux kernel bug involved.\n\n*Try using another interface -- for instance, if you're using USB and if the drive supports eSATA, try eSATA.\n\n\nTry these in any order that you like.\n", "Q: How to setup WiFi network to access internet I am new to Ubuntu/Linux.

My machine only has Ubuntu installed (13.04) but one data drive is NTFS (because I didn't realize that the disk was NTFS formatted when I started using it). I now used Gparted to reduce the partition and make room for a new data partition in ext4 format so that I can move the data there instead, then delete the NTFS partition and resize the ext4 partition to use the entire disk.\nAfter reducing the NTFS partition and creating the ext4 partition, Gparted now Gparted has  an exclamation mark (top) and tells me this (bottom).\nI'm asked to run Windows Checkdisk twice, but I don't have Windows installed and it's very tedious to pull the drive out of the computer and hunt down a Windows pc with SATA connectors. Is there any way for me to fix this, besides using Windows?\nThe NTFS data partition is not available until I've fixed it, so I can't read its data and copy it to the new ext4 partition. If I could just reliably read it, this problem might be irrelevant.\n\n\nFinal update and solution:\nI can't accept either answer because the Linux tools could not resolve the problem. In the end, I booted my machine with a Windows 7 installation disk and started the repair/recovery function. In there, I could open a command prompt and run the chkdsk /f which solved the problem :-)\n\nA: You do not need to install ntfsprogs, it is now part of the default ntfs-3g driver. And with some older versions of Ubuntu installing ntfsprogs installed the old version and uninstalled ntfs-3g.\nOn April 12, 2011 it was announced that Ntfsprogs project was merged with NTFS-3G\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ntfsprogs\nman ntfsprogs (from 12.04,so applies to newer versions also)\nThe  ntfsprogs  are part of the ntfs-3g package which can be downloaded\n       from:\n       http://www.tuxera.com/community/\nFrom synaptic:\nntfsprogs\nPackage to ease upgrading from older ntfsprogs packages to the new ntfs-3g\npackage.\nThis package can be purged at anytime once the ntfs-3g package has been\ninstalled.\nThe ntfsfix does minor repairs which may work but sets the chkdsk flag so if you reboot it runs it. And partitions with the chkdsk flag are usually not mounted with ntfs-3g to prevent further damage that chkdsk might not fix. But if not a bootable Windows then chkdsk will  not be run.

I've built a tool that doesn't need any actual compilation - it's just a Perl script - and when I run bzr builddeb on it, I get a WORKING .deb file which copies my script - zfsync - to /usr/bin/zfsync when I run dpkg -i zfsync_1.0.0-0ubuntu3_all.deb.\nHowever, when I run bzr builddeb -S and then dput the resulting source.changes file to my PPA, it builds without errors... but apt-get install zfsync results in a \"successful\" installation, only my binary isn't actually placed in /usr/bin!\nI have a debian/install file which contains zfsync usr/bin and nothing else.  Out of desperation, I created a simple Makefile which, if make install is run, will copy zfsync to /usr/bin also.  Nothing seems to help, though, and the half-hour \"build\" time on Canonical's godawful arm-based PPA farm is making me lose my mind.\nWhen I do an apt-get source zfsync, looking in the source directory fetched shows me no debian/install file whatsoever.  I don't know why the PPA is stripping that file, but it apparently is - and without it, my script doesn't actually get installed.\nPlease, please, are there any packaging gurus out there?  Help!\n\nA: I still have no idea why it was screwing me - I was following the Ubuntu packaging guide to the letter - but eventually I got it working.\nWhat I ended up doing is: apt-get source zfsync into a completely different directory, then investigating what was in there.  \nIn addition to a \"zfsync-1.0.0\" folder which contained all my stuff, there was a \"zfsync\" folder that had usr/share/doc in there but no usr/bin at all.

Each session ends with the same phenomenon. No matter what program I use on Ubuntu, at some time the mouse shows the following dysfunction: The mouse works only in the current running window. It is not possible to finish the current window with the mouse. Mousepointer can be moved, but has no further function. Cancelling with the keyboard is still possible. Error occurs with any other mouse, but the definite moment of dysfunction is not replicable. Sometimes error remains even after reboot. \nSystem is installed parallel to windows 7 32-bit. Ubuntu is also 32-bit.\nThanks for your help.\n\nA: Hard to trouble shoot this issue with such little information. Firstly i'd recommend comparing the results of xinput list and lsinput when the mouse is functioning correctly and then when the mouse has stopped functioning correctly. \nxinput list - will show what input devices are recognized by xorg. \nlsinput - will show your device and its capabilities ( what kind of events it can produce ). Maybe the capabilities is changing, for some strange reason which prevents mouse clicks.\n", "Q: Why does UEFI installer not run on my EFI machine? Have been working on building a multi boot system using EFI. This EFI capable system can not boot Ubuntu or any other installation media using EFI with the only exception being Windows installation media. Most distributions appear to be using grub for their boot manager and boot loader so trying different distributions and tools such as Parted Magic and Boot Repair give same results when trying to boot EFI mode in order for an EFI install to be done.\nWhat happens when trying to boot media EFI mode is if EFI grub manager loads (black screen) and if any choice is selected (Try Ubuntu, Install Ubuntu or Verify) get error can not read disk and the kernel need to be loaded first). There appears to be no explanation online (that I have found so far) that goes anywhere near describing how and why this happens.\nThe accepted way of installing Ubuntu to an EFI system is apparently switched off EFI and install in legacy mode which involves creating a bios-grub partition before commencing or let boot-repair to do the fix after installing Ubuntu in legacy mode.  Boot Repair detects EFI system and creates the bios_grub partition and installs grub-efi.  \nSo after getting Ubuntu and Windows booting using EFI I noticed the grub_bios partition was still in existence so i removed it with gdisk and still have Windows and Ubuntu booting.\nWhy doesn't boot-repair delete bios_grub partition after installing grub-efi?\n14/08/2013 UPDATE: After installing rEFInd boot-repair cd now boots EFI mode.\n\n\n*\n\n*Is bios_grub some kind of MBR partition? How does this differ from a protective MBR which is in EFI partition?\n\n\nOnline there is some reference to Secure Boot causing system to throw \"you need to load kernel first\" error or simply to hang at a black screen. What causes the \"you need to load kernel first\" error on system that appears to not being using Secure Boot as there is nothing in firmware settings or vendor documentation that mentions this. Windows Upgrade Assistant says this system is not Secure Boot capable.  \n\n\n*\n\n*Are there different versions of Secure Boot?\n\n*How to identify if system is Secure Boot capable?\n\n*This system uses EFI instead of UEFI. Does this use different Secure\nBoot?\n\n*Why does the UEFI installer not run on this machine?\n\nA: Boot-Repair does not create nor delete partitions.\nDuring a BIOS install on gpt partitioned drive, Ubuntu will create a bios_grub partition. It did not used to as when I installed with 10.10, I had to manually create the bios_grub.\nIt is only 1MB, so it is not taking up any room on most new systems. That much space is lost in the new rounding for compatibility with SSDs & 4K drives.\nBut once you are booting with UEFI then you can delete the bios_grub partition as you need either the efi partition for UEFI boot or the bios_grub partition for BIOS boot. I typically suggest for new drives to have both partitions at the start of a gpt drive and then you can install either way or easily change later. Often difficult to add an efi partition near start of a drive that is already full of data. So then converting to UEFI is difficult.\nUpdates.\nIf starting with a blank drive  and wanting secure boot, this series of videos may help.

In fact there are two different middle mouse button behaviors, one for the upper and center part of the middle button (your problem middle mouse behavior) and another one for the bottom of the middle mouse button.\nHowever the mouse behavior can be changed using xinput. Open the terminal and type xinput. The output of running xinput will tell you the full device name and the device id of your Logitech Zone Touch T400 wireless mouse. All you need to note from running this command is the device id number of your mouse. In the commands that follow, I'll call the mouse id number id#. In the commands that follow, substitute your mouse id number for id#.\nTo display the mouse properties run:\nxinput list-props id#\n\nFind the display property called Button Labels. Read the whole line of the display property called Button Labels to find out what each mouse button of your mouse does. Next you need to display the list of digits corresponding to each Button Label. To do this run:\nxinput get-button-map id#\n\nNext you can switch the mouse actions by switching the numbers around that you got from running xinput get-button-map id#. Let's say you have 12 mouse actions and you want to switch mouse action 11 with mouse action 12. To do this run:\nxinput set-button-map id# 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 12 11 \n\n\nA: Unfortunately, I don't think the button on the T400 that calls the dash (or the overview in Gnome, or the start menu in Windows) can be remapped.  It seems to send the \"Super\" keyboard button signal to the system.  I attempted to remap every button [all 24 according to 'xinput get-button-map'] on the mouse to do a right-click, but still the middle button brings up the overview/dash.  \n\nA: You can remap the \"Super_L\" (keycode 133) to button_2 (middle button) by the following method:\nhttp://linuxaleph.blogspot.com/2008/11/mapping-middle-click-to-keyboard-key.html\n\nA: I have this mouse, the only 'fix' I was able to come up with is the \"emulate middle click by clicking both left and right buttons\" in the \"Mouse and touchpad\" 'zone' in settings.\nNot the best solution, but it works for me.\n", "Q: \"Unsafe permissions on configuration file `/home/david/.gnupg/gpg.conf\" What does it mean and how to fix? gpg: WARNING: unsafe permissions on configuration file `/home/david/.gnupg/gpg.conf'\ngpg: WARNING: unsafe enclosing directory permissions on configuration file `/home/david/.gnupg/gpg.conf'\ngpg: external program calls are disabled due to unsafe options file permissions\ngpg: keyserver communications error: general error\ngpg: keyserver receive failed: general error\n\nWhat does it mean and how to fix?\n\nA: I just faced the same problem. It turned out I was running the gpg command using sudo. When I tried again without sudo, it worked fine and no error was displayed.

The first one ensures that the ~/.gnupg folder (and everything in it) is actually yours. To possibly overtake ownership, it requires root privileges, thus the sudo.

This will mount the \"root subvolume\" - the default place to put the \"@\" Linux root subvolume, as well as \"@home\" and your brand new subvolume.\n\n\n*\n\n*Go there (you will see all the already made , and make a copy of the already copied subvolume by\nsudo btrfs subvolume snapshot  @mynewroot\nThe path to the copied root, is just the path where you have copied the root files.\n\n\n*\n\n*Delete the originally-copied-but-placed-in-not-the-best-place subvolume by\nsudo btrfs subvolume delete \n\nNow, the last remark:\nTo make a copy of subvolume on the same btrfs partition you just need to do sudo btrfs subvolume snapshot <path to the copied root> @mynewroot (ideal, when you want to test in parallel many btrfs-based Linux distributions, but not own 1TB hard drive). In this case, after installing the next Linux OS on the same partition, as your Ubuntu (but on different root subvolume), try deduplicating it. If it is similar distribution (like Linux Mint), you will save a lot of space!\nTo copy between partitions, use btrfs send and btrfs receive - this will automatically preserve all links, and stuff; it is equivalent to dd, but will only copy the relevant information, and operate on a subvolumes, rather on the whole partitions.\n", "Q: Samba error ubuntu server 12.04.2 I am attempting to install an FTP server and continue to get this error code when installing samba.\n/var/lib/dpkg/info/samba4.postinst: 14: /var/lib/dpkg/info/samba4.postinst: /usr/share/samba/setoption.pl: Permission denied\ndpkg: error processing samba4 (--configure):\n subprocess installed post-installation script returned error exit status 126\nErrors were encountered while processing:\n samba4\nE: Sub-process /usr/bin/dpkg returned an error code (1)\n\n\nA: Please provide more information, such as the exact command you typed in Terminal to get that error.\nFirst, let me include how to install Samba:\nOpen a Terminal Window (Ctrl+Alt+T\n) and type each of these commands in:\nsudo apt-get install samba samba-common\nsudo apt-get install python-glade2\nsudo apt-get install system-config-samba\n\nThe following commands will help you install Samba via the Terminal, install dependencies for the Configuration tool, and the graphical interface.\nIf the error is Permission denied, that means you did not run the command with elevated privileges.

Can Ubuntu 32 bit run on 64 windows 8? \n\nA: You can install either Ubuntu 32-bit or Ubuntu 64-bit. It depends on the amount of memory that you are allocating to your virtual machine. If you are allocating 3GB or more memory to your virtual machine, then you should choose Ubuntu 64-bit, otherwise you may choose either one. The performance of Ubuntu 64-bit will be noticeably better than Ubuntu 32-bit if you have allocated 3GB or more of memory to the virtual machine. By the way it is recommended to allocate not more than half of the available memory in your system to the virtual machine.\n\nA: Yes it can. But I would choose 64bit. It will run faster. Only choose 32 bit if the drivers you need are only made for a 32 bit OS.

If your a mouse person find this option in the view menu, or other menus depending on which file manager you use. If you used winetricks, or PlayonLinux then the directory will have a different name.

If you wish to install Ubuntu on a large number of machines there is no need to purchase a bulk license  something that would be needed with an operating system like Windows. There is definitely no legal issues with installing Ubuntu, the .iso files are there on this page for free downloads. \n\nA: Ubuntu follows the policy of free to everyone. It is an open source operating system that comes absolutely free of cost you can install it in as many systems as you like. It comes under GPL i.e. General Public Licaense which states it's purpose. You can get most of the softwares as well using the Ubuntu's official repository that too absolutely free of charge without wandering here or there.\nThat's the power of open-source use it, distribute it modify it whatever you like either for your personal use or for commercial use its FREE!!! \n", "Q: If I'm building from source, why does it require more space than installing via apt-get? I was trying to install the program by compiling and then installing it. I choose PINTA.\nIt requires these dependencies:\nmono mono-xbuild automake autoconf libmono-cairo2.0-cil gtk-sharp2\n\nand these resources:\n\n\n*\n\n*Need to get 20.6MiB/26.2MiB of archives and \n\n*66.4 MB of additional disk space**,  \n\n\nbut when I used apt-get install pinta, it just requires 20.3MiB of additional disk space and 0/6616 KB of archives. \nIf I'm building from source, why does it require more space compared to the apt-get method?\n\nA: \nmono mono-xbuild automake autoconf libmono-cairo2.0-cil gtk-sharp2\n\nThose are the packages required for building Pinta, they are not Pinta itself. So, for building from sources, you need the libraries, the headers, toolchain, etc., so, the package already compiled is:\n\n\n*\n\n*[binary sources + hard linked libraries + configuration files generated + activated options] / the amount of packages that could be extracted from the sources (ie, some package have the debug symbols in other package)\n\n*while the \"real\" size of your compiled binary sources + hard linked libraries + configuration files generated + activated options + headers files + tool chain + libraries - whatever you deactivate/uninstall later.\nAlso, you may notice that the packages generated by Ubuntu repositories are built in slightly older kernels, so even if you use the same set of tools/options, the results might not be the same due the differences of kernel and libc-dev version.\n\nA: Braiam's answer is fine. In simple and short words, the difference is:\nInstalling from the repositories using apt-get downloads ready to use packages built for Ubuntu. But when you try to install from the source, you also need the tools to build the software (which means additional downloads and installations).\nIt's just like buying a ready hamburger from McDonald's compared to buying all the ingredients from a supermarket and making hamburgers at home ...\nhope that makes it clear :)\n", "Q: Ripping DVDs with menu I used this answer and have ripped a DVD to back it up using dvd::rip. Although it doesn't seem to actually rip the menu, it does rip everything as a seperate file, which is what I would expect and is obviously fine.\nHowever, it only seems to ripping in to .vob format (I have set it to go to .avi). Also, it is ripping in to files that are 22 minutes long (This does not relate to chapters on the dvd at all).\nI am quite sure I have followed the manual, thought I don't know how up to date it is. If there are any very easy tools to \"glue\" together the files then that would also be good.\n\nA: The Ubuntu forums had a few solutions after I asked here - http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=2166602\nIn particular ripping the whole iso, using\ndd if=/dev/dvd of=/path/dvd.iso\n\nseems to do exactly what I wanted\n", "Q: How do I find out if my system is using Mir? I've just installed Mir and I'm wondering if I'm actually running it or if it fell back to X. How can I tell if Mir is running?\n\nA: ps -e | grep unity-system-co\n\nWill return one response if Mir is running, nothing if it is not.  This is because 'ps -e' actually truncates the process names to 15 characters (known upstream bug/limitation).  I found the suggestion from minerz029 always returned nothing even if Mir was running.\n\nA: \nYou can also simply check if the system compositor process is running:\n ps afx | grep unity-system-compositor\n\n\nOn my system running Mir it returns something like this:\njorge@jillociraptor:~$ ps afx | grep unity-system-compositor\n 4260 pts/0    S+     0:00          |   |               \\_ grep --color=auto unity-system-compositor\n 1606 ?

Mir is really just a set of libraries.  There are client libraries and server libraries.  There are also several different packages that provide actual Mir server binaries.\nThere is a demo Mir server, but if you were running it you would know, because you'd have switched to a VT and typed in the command to run it.  That server is found in the mir-demos package.\nThere's the Unity 8 Mir server.  It runs as a part of Unity 8 (package unity8).  You'd know you were running that because your desktop would look like a Unity 8 desktop.\nFinally, there is the unity-system-compositor Mir server, which is generally started by LightDM.  Unless you wrote your own LightDM integration scripts, you either need to install the Unity 8 desktop session (package unity8-desktop-session-mir), in which case the only way to run the Mir server is to log in to the Unity 8 desktop, or you installed the ubuntu-desktop-mir package, in which case the other answers are correct:  a ps will show the unity-system-compositor running underneath the X server.\n", "Q: Laptop boots straight up to windows 8 without asking me to start Ubuntu or anything using a live usb stick I've turned off secure boot and fast boot but my laptop boots straight up to windows.

I am currently stuck here.Someone please help me to get the data back.\nAny suggestion and help is really truly appreciated.\n\nA: If I'm not mistaken, the installer has a well said warning that it will delete all your Windows programs, documents, photos, music, and any other files. The correct method of installation is using Something else, then manually deleting and creating the partitions yourself. Also, you should had a backup! The installer did what it was supposed to do, delete everything and install Ubuntu.\n\n\nA: As others have said, a professional data recovery service is your best bet for recovery; however, if you can't afford such services (they are pricey), you can try it yourself with a couple of tools:\n\n\n*\n\n*TestDisk -- This program can recover whole filesystems. If you're VERY lucky, it might be able to recover your D: partition more-or-less intact. (You'll need to delete your Linux partitions first, though.)\n\n*PhotoRec -- This program recovers individual files rather than whole partitions. It's more likely to work in your case than TestDisk, but the last I checked, it couldn't recover file names, just their contents. This means you're likely to spend hours sifting through the files it recovers.\n\n\nThere are Windows tools that do the same thing as these Linux programs, and I believe that there are Windows file-recovery tools that can recover filenames, so you might want to search for such a tool before using PhotoRec. I don't have recommendations for specific Windows programs, though.\nIn either case, you should do a low-level backup of the disk to another disk before attempting any recovery. That way, if your recovery attempt makes matters worse, you can go back to your current state. In Linux, the dd tool can do a low-level backup, as in sudo dd if=/dev/sda of=~/sda-backup.img. This example backs up /dev/sda to a file called sda-backup.img in your home directory. You must have a big enough hard disk partition mounted at /home to hold the backup in this example (you can mount the backup disk elsewhere or even back up to the whole disk rather than to a file -- but you must be very careful to get the disks straight when backing up to a whole disk).\n\nA: I would advise you to try and find a local data recovery professional if the data was indeed valuable since the partition has likely been erased and the data overwritten.\nThere might be a chance to recover some of your data.\nIf you feel confident in your own skills there is a general data recovery guideline in the Ubuntu Community Help Wiki to start you off. Good luck.\n", "Q: Hand of Thief malware? Anyone know anything about the Hand of Thief malware that has been announced for sale on an apparent underground cyber crime forum? It is said that is has been tested to work on Ubuntu! Should I be worried and I'm assuming Canonical is taking steps to stop this malware?  \n\nA: I have read several articles on it.

Right!?\n\nSo as I stated earlier, if you are careful you should be safe.  To sum it up, don't open any file sent from someone you don't know and be very careful in clicking links sent to you by people you do(both of which you should already be doing anyway).\nThe article I referred and linked to is the best of several I read on \"Hand of Thief\" trojan and I would refer you to it if you would like any further information.\n\nI would also refer you to the article sited by Mitch in his comment to your question.  It also states the lack of distribution that this malware has, albeit in a slightly different way and a bit more vaguely. \n\nWithout the ability to spread the malware as widely as on the Windows platform, the price tag seems hefty, and raises the question – will the Linux Trojan have the same value as its Windows counterparts?\n\nI will repeat the link so that my sources are cited but the credit for this one still goes to Mitch.  Thieves Reaching for Linux—”Hand of Thief” Trojan Targets Linux \n\nEdit on 9-10-13  A new article was written about \"HoT\", while I don't want to necro-bump this question, just to make my answer more complete I will quote it here[my emphasis added] :\n\nOnce installed, HoT would seek to grab information from Web forms and send the results to a botnet server.

I was expecting that after installing the package libgtk-3-0-dbg I would get DDD to show the source code when stepping into gtk+, however I had to download the source package myself (from here) and move it to the proper /build directory :(\n\nA: -dbg packages aren't automatic - the package maintainer needs to define the package, and pass the appropriate parameters to the package building tools to ensure the package has any content.\nBy convention, but not by actual policy, the -dbg package is populated with data which would otherwise be removed by a call to GNU strip, i.e. debugging symbols which are stripped by default (again, by convention, but not policy). Or some language-specific equivalent in the case of non-ELF libraries (e.g. .mdb files for .NET libraries).\nThe convention doesn't call for -dbg packages to include source (since we already have a mechanism for including those and making them available, i.e. apt-get source pkgname).\nUbuntu has a mechanism for automatic creation of \"Debug debs\", or .ddeb files, which are functionally the same as -dbg packages but are created automatically by build servers (i.e. an unmodified package with no -dbg package, compiled on Ubuntu's servers, will get a .ddeb automatically) - but, again, because there is a mechanism in place for making source available, .ddebs do not include source as they don't need to.\n", "Q: 13.04 The Software center stopped working after update: an unhandled error occured I've done a clean installation of ubuntu 13.04 2 weeks ago and I can't say the usual user experience that I knew for ubuntu is not there.  \nI just did an update and restarted my machine as asked then, I realized I can't install anything any more. the error I get is: \nTraceback (most recent call last):\nFile \"/usr/lib/python3/dist-packages/aptdaemon/worker.py\", line 1185, in _simulate\ntrans.high_trust_packages) = self.__simulate(trans)\nFile \"/usr/lib/python3/dist-packages/aptdaemon/worker.py\", line 1304, in __simulate\nunauthenticated = self._get_unauthenticated()\nFile \"/usr/lib/python3/dist-packages/aptdaemon/worker.py\", line 451, in _get_unauthenticated\nfor origin in pkg.candidate.origins:\nFile \"/usr/lib/python3/dist-packages/apt/package.py\", line 479, in origins\norigins.append(Origin(self.package, packagefile))\nFile \"/usr/lib/python3/dist-packages/apt/package.py\", line 145, in __init__\nself.archive = packagefile.archive\nUnicodeDecodeError: 'utf-8' codec can't decode byte 0xb3 in position 3: invalid start byte\n\nCan anyone shed some lights on what's happening, and what are my options?\nThanks in advance.\nEDIT\nsudo apt-get install --reinstall software-center\n\nproduces the following: \nReading package lists...

In which case it would look like this: \nsudo ln -s /lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libudev.so.1 /lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libudev.so.0\n\nA: What you can try is to link the installed files to the ones the program is looking for:\nsudo apt-get install libudev1 && cd /lib/i386-linux-gnu/ && sudo ln -s libudev.so.1 libudev.so.0\n\nA: Also, as peterflynn said\n\nNote for anyone else encountering this (from #8553): a \"libudev.so.0\" error when installing Brackets on 64-bit Linux may indicate you downloaded a 32-bit version of Brackets by accident.\n\n\nA: I agree with the solution\nsudo ln -s <libudevpath>/libudev.so.1 <libudevpath>/libudev.so.0\n\nHowever, if you just blindly assume to find libudev1 in /lib/i386-linux-gnu/, it might not be there. If libudev1 installs somewhere else, you can find it using:\nsudo find / -name \"libudev.so*\"\n\n\nA: I agree with the solution\nsudo ln -s <libudevpath>/libudev.so.1 <libudevpath>/libudev.so.0\n\nThis creates a symbolic link between two files. Whenever an application looks for <libudevpath>/libudev.so.0 (which deosn't really exist), it will follow this link and use <libudevpath>/libudev.so.1 instead.\nHowever, if you just blindly assume to find libudev1 in /lib/x86_64-linux-gnu, it might not be there. If libudev1 installs somewhere else, you can find it using:\nsudo find / -name \"libudev.so*\"\n\n", "Q: Is it possible to open an Ubuntu app from HTML? I'm creating a webpage right now and am wondering if it is possible to input a command in HTML that will open an installed Ubuntu app like Chromium, or a terminal window, or Nautilus. \nIs something like this possible? Thanks!\n\nA: Yes, it is called \"Web-based protocol handlers\". You need Chrome 13 or Firefox 3.0 or higher. I have seen it used to open LibreOffice.\nBoth Mozilla and updates.html5rocks have an explanation about how this works. (Open in Chrome/Chromium chrome://settings/handlers and it will show a list of current handlers. Firefox will list them in about:config.)\nParts from the 1st link:\nRegistering\nSetting up a web application as a protocol handler is not a difficult process. Basically, the web application uses registerProtocolHandler() to register itself with the browser as a potential handler for a given protocol. For example:\nnavigator.registerProtocolHandler(\"mailto\",\n                              \"https://www.example.com/?uri=%s\",\n                              \"Example Mail\");\n\nWhere the parameters are:\n\n\n*\n\n*The protocol.\n\n*The URL template, used as the handler. The \"%s\" is replaced with the href of the link and a GET is executed on the resultant URL.\n\n*The user friendly name for the protocol handler.\n\n\nWhen a browser executes this code, it should display a prompt to the user, asking permission to allow the web application to register as a handler for the protocol. Firefox displays a prompt in the notification bar area.\nExample\n<!DOCTYPE HTML PUBLIC \"-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.01//EN\">\n<html lang=\"en\">\n<head>\n    <title>Web Protocol Handler Sample - Register</title>\n    <script type=\"text/javascript\">\nnavigator.registerProtocolHandler(\"fake\", \"http://starkravingfinkle.org/projects/wph/handler.php?value=%s\", \"Fake Protocol\");\n    </script>\n</head>\n<body>\n    <h1>Web Protocol Handler Sample</h1>\n    <p>This web page will install a web protocol handler for the <code>fake:</code> protocol.</p>\n</body>\n</html>\n\n\nA: Yes, you can by adding a new protocol handler in your Ubuntu. The following method will show you how to register the process of opening an application as app://[application_name] protocol handler in Ubuntu.\n1. Create application launcher script\n\n\n*\n\n*In a terminal run:\nmkdir -p bin\n\nThis command will make a bin directory in your home folder if you don't already have it.\n\n*After run:\ngedit ~/bin/open_app.sh\n\nThis will create the new file open_app.sh in gedit.\n\n*Copy and paste the following script in the new created file:\n#!/bin/bash\n\nif [[ \"$1\" != \"app://\" ]]; then \n    app=${1#app://}\n    nohup \"$app\" &>/dev/null &\nelse \n    nohup gnome-terminal &>/dev/null &\nfi\n\n\n*Save the file and close it.\n\n*Go back into terminal and run: \nchmod +x ~/bin/open_app.sh\n\nto grant execute access for the script.\n2. Create .desktop file for application launcher\nNow you must create a .desktop launcher for the above script, and tell Ubuntu to use this launcher as app:// protocol handler. Create /usr/share/applications/appurl.desktop file using the following command:\nsudo -H gedit /usr/share/applications/appurl.desktop\n\nand add the following content:\n[Desktop Entry]\nName=TerminalURL\nExec=/home/radu/bin/open_app.sh %u\nType=Application\nNoDisplay=true\nCategories=System;\nMimeType=x-scheme-handler/app;\n\nSave the file and close it.\n3. Refresh mime types database\nIn the file above, the line MimeType=x-scheme-handler/app; register app:// scheme handler, but to make it work we should update mime types database cache by executing command:\nsudo update-desktop-database \n\n4. Test from terminal\nNow everything should work. To test that it works from terminal, run for example this command:\nxdg-open 'app://gedit'\n\n4. Test from browser using HTML\nYou can test from browser by using for example the following HTML web page:\n<!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC \"-//W3C//DTD XHTML 1.0 Strict//EN\"\n    \"http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml1/DTD/xhtml1-strict.dtd\">\n<html xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" xml:lang=\"en\" lang=\"en\">\n\n<head>\n    <title>Open some applications</title>\n    <meta http-equiv=\"content-type\" content=\"text/html;charset=utf-8\" />\n</head>\n\n<body>\n        <h3>Open some applications in Ubuntu from HTML</h3>\n        <p>Open terminal: <a title=\"Open\" href=\"app://\">app://</a>\n        (equivalent with: <a title=\"Open\" href=\"app://gnome-terminal\">app://gnome-terminal</a>)</p>\n        <p>Open Nautilus: <a title=\"Open\" href=\"app://nautilus\">app://nautilus</a></p>\n        <p>Open Chromium: <a title=\"Open\" href=\"app://chromium-browser\">app://chromium-browser</a></p>\n        <p>Open Ubuntu Software Center: <a title=\"Open\" href=\"app://software-center\">app://software-center</a>\n        (equivalent with: <a title=\"Open\" href=\"apt://\">apt://</a>)</p>\n        <p>...and so on</p>\n</body>\n\n</html>\n\nThe result:\n\n", "Q: Connecting two separate machines to the same network I'm using Hadoop to do some data analysis for a university project. My university has kindly given me access to a Virtual Machine, which I access through a given IP address using PuTTY in Windows 8. Once connected, the system is running Ubuntu 64bit.\nBefore I put anything on this system I am testing it on my own laptop. I have Oracle's VirtualBox and a Ubuntu 64 bit installation on it.\nAs my \"main work\" is being done on the Virtual Machine the university has given me access to, thus far I'm using Hadoop on a single cluster (defying the whole point of the \"big data analysis\" part of my project). Is there a way for me to connect that virtual machine to my VirtualBox version of Ubuntu to at least demonstrate a cluster of two nodes, or is this impossible as they are not on the same network?\n\nA: The two Hadoop servers don't need to be on the same local network. If you assign a routable ip address to your local Hadoop vm (possibly using bridged networking) can you ping each server?\nlocal_hadoop$ ping remote_hadoop\n\nand\nremote_hadoop$ ping local_hadoop\n\nIf so you are good to go. If not you can create a vpn between the two servers.\nI recommend OpenVPN. It is easy to setup. Configure the remote Hadoop as the OpenVPN server. Your local Hadoop vm as a client. Use pre-shared keys for simplicity. Once configured the two Hadoop vm will be on a virtual local network.\n", "Q: Pre-upgrade questions about upgrading from ATI 4870 to nVidia GTX650 on 12.04 I'm upgrading my computer's video card. I've been using the open source 'radeon' driver with an AMD HD4870. My new card is a nVidia GTX650 that I'm planning on using the proprietary drivers with.\nI know if you're using the flgrx drivers for ati/amd, you have to remove those first before installing your new card. Since I'm using the radeon open source drivers, how do I go about making sure I don't reboot into an unworking display? Do I need to remove or otherwise make some sort of configuration prior to removing the HD4870 and installing the GTX650?\nThanks!\n\nA: If you're switching from AMD to NVIDIA, you have several ways of doing this:\n1 - Poweroff PC, put new card, remove old drivers, install new drivers\nBy booting the new card without the new drivers installed, will get you to a console terminal, no problem there, simply remove old drivers and install new ones.\n2 - You can go to init 3 with the PC turned on, remove old drivers install new ones, shutdown and then insert new graphic card.\n", "Q: Does Ubuntu 13.04 have a desktop environment built-in? I have a VPS on which I'm planning to install Ubuntu 13.04 .. I plan to use VNC to access this VPS. Currently I use 11.04, which is very much outdated now. When I installed 11.04, I had to follow a guide (here) to first install ubuntu-desktop and then install GNOME, and then I could get VNC up and running ?\nSo would I have to manually install this stuff for 13.04 as well ? Or does it come built-in now ? If its still requires manual installation, are there any guides (I'm a n00b at this) ?\n\nA: What you installed is the -server- version of Ubuntu. That one does not come with a desktop but you can add software onto it (like a desktop) as instructed in that link you posted. It is common to have the server version on a webhost since most only want to use SQL and a webserver (and those do not require a desktop).\nIf you install the -desktop- version all the things you installed manually would have installed as well (ie. ubuntu-desktop). \nVNC is separate though; you still need to install this yourself.\n\nA: A server installation of Ubuntu does not come with a desktop environment, but you can install these afterwards with apt-get install.\nA desktop edition of Ubuntu 13.04 comes with the desktop environment \"Unity\", older versions of Ubuntu come with GNOME.\n", "Q: Swap partition on 13.04 not working I have installed Ubuntu 13.04 on my Dell Studio 1555 laptop and the swap partition isn't mounting or the system is just not using it.

Anyways, I put the NEW UUID in the etc/fstab and now it it working fine... Not sure how this happened but apparently it was the user that was the problem and not the system, which is usually the issue. Thank you to Mitch for helping out. Hope this helps out anyone else.\n\nA: I tested some thing there.  I have turned swap off, and then back on, and I get the same output from free.  Which leads me to believe that the swap is there, but the system has no need to use it at the time you issued the command.\n\n", "Q: Cross Compiling a DVD Driver for Arm I've just registered on the codeforge website & downloaded the Sunplus DVD Driver at:\nhttp://www.codeforge.com/article/166926\nI'm using Ubuntu 64 bit 12.04 & have installed the Linaro Toolchain for Arm.

Run the file command on all the files in the ~/Desktop/driver directory:\nfile *\n\nYou'll see some of them are \"7-zip archive data\" files. Run 7z l on each of them, to see the contents:\n7z l data.bin\n\nMaybe there are too many files, so you can just grep for the one you are looking for:\n7z l data.bin | grep hw_cdc_driver.c\n\nIf you find it, then you need to extract the archive.\nmkdir data_bin\nmv data.bin data_bin\ncd data_bin\n7z x data.bin\nrm data.bin\n\nNow you have the contents of the archive in the data_bin directory. Search for the hw_cdc_driver.c file, open it, and go to line 2589 (the one from the error). You can just comment that line containing dbg (add a // in front of it) and save then close the file.\nTo pack the archive with the modified file, use 7z again:\ncd data_bin\n7z a data.bin data_bin\nmv data.bin ..\n\nNow you have replaced data.bin with the fixed file.

For example, you can specify a static configuration by setting the method to 'Manual' in the IPv4 settings tab and filling in the details in the boxes provided.\nIf you are using Ubuntu server (without network-manager) then the recommended way to specify DNS servers is to append them to the interface stanza in /etc/network/interfaces, e.g.\ndns-nameservers 8.8.8.8 8.8.4.4\n\n\nA: You can put your settings for a static ip on interfaces file:\nsudo vi /etc/network/interfaces\nThen restart your networking:\nsudo /etc/init.d/networking restart\nIf you want more info check out this site.\n", "Q: Set CLASSPATH for python I want to execute a python file called ex1.py. The execution works fine, the program does, what it ought to do. \nThe problem is the following: This file is stored in the folder /user_name/pythonEx.

So, you can also make ex1.py executable, then you can run\nPATH=/user_name/pythonEx:$PATH\nex1.py\n\n\nA: First of all, it looks like you are adding a directory in the root directory to your “CLASSPATH” variable. User directories are located in the /home directory (i.e., the path you would want to add to your PATH is /home/user_name/pythonEX).\nSecond, you are supposed to add the directory to the PATH variable, not “CLASSPATH” (which I've never heard of, but perhaps it does something). The way to do this is to write (in your .bashrc file): PATH=\"$PATH:<the new path>\". So to add the aforementioned directory to your path, use this line in your .bashrc: PATH=\"$PATH:$HOME/pythonEx\". This should allow you to execute your ex1.py file, if it is located in $HOME/pythonEx, by typing python ex1.py.\n", "Q: No desktop showing in Ubuntu 13.04 via VNC on a VPS I have a VPS on which till now I've been using ubuntu 11.04 ...

I'm using UEFI :P Okay, this is my first time asking a question here.  I have used Ubuntu on my computers for a few years now, and I recently bought a Windows 8 (oh no!) ultrabook that I have been trying to put Ubuntu on.  It is a Lenovo P400 Touch if that makes a difference.  Let me get yall' up to speed:  I disable secureboot and fastboot, then successfully installed 13.04 alongside windows 8 with no problems at all.  Both operating systems were fully functional.  Then, after installing a few plugins, I restarted Ubuntu and I received an error saying I was running in low graphics mode, but I couldn't do anything, like, whenever I clicked a button, it did nothing.  I decided, no big deal, I will just re-install Ubuntu but using 12.04 this time (I like the LTS versions more).  BUT..... When I boot to the livecd, it will show the menu to choose what to do, but the menu is tiny, scrambled, and scrunched up at the top of the screen and I can't tell what anything says.  I would like to try nomodeset I guess but I still cant see what I'm doing.  So I decided to reinstall 13.04 because it worked before, but the livecd for that is doing the same thing!!!  So is the 12.04 alternate version!!!!!  I'm really stumped here you guys... is there anyone who could offer any advice?  Remember, I'm using UEFI, not legacy BIOS.  P.S., I checked the settings in the UEFI menu (bios) for any video settings, and I played around with a few things, still nothing.\n\nA: Okay I figured out a workaround to the problem.  I loaded the boot-menu of the livecd on a friends laptop (using UEFI mode to match mine), I wrote down the options, went back to my laptop, ran the cd, choosing what I assumed were the right choices and voila!  it was only the boot menu that was messed up, the rest of the installation process used the correct graphics driver!\n", "Q: How to order desktop icons by name in XFCE? I'm using Xfce 4.8 installed on Ubuntu 12.04.2 LTS and I'm wondering what's the alternative for Right-click -> Order by name on XFCE. Right now, when I right click on my desktop, it looks like this:\n\nAs you can see, there's no option for rearranging the icons. If my assumption is correct, it can't be done directly via GUI.

Next I will explain how.\n1. Create a perl script that automatically arrange desktop icons\nYou don't have to know something about perl scripting. Just follow the below steps:\n\n\n*\n\n*In terminal run:\nmkdir -p bin\n\nThis command will make a bin directory in your home folder if you don't already have it.\n\n*After run:\ngedit ~/bin/arrange_icons.pl\n\nThis will create the new file arrange_icons.pl in gedit.\n\n*Copy and paste the following script in the new created file:\n#!/usr/bin/perl\n\n######################################################\n## Script to automatically arrange desktop icons\n## Modified from the original script found at\n##    http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?p=7755880\n######################################################\n\nuse strict;\n\n## find out the location of the config file\nmy $icons_file = `locate icons.screen0 | grep \\$USER | grep .config | grep desktop | head -n 1`;\n\n## open the config file to read from it\nopen(CONFIG, \"<$icons_file\") or die(\"Can't open $icons_file for reading!!\");\n\nmy @icon_config = <CONFIG>;\n\nclose(CONFIG);\n\n## grab all the icon names from the desktop\nmy @icons;\nforeach my $line (@icon_config) {\n    if ($line =~ /^(\\[.*?\\])$/) { push(@icons, $1) }\n}\n\n## sort all the icon names in alphabetical order\n@icons = sort @icons;\n\n## open the config file to write to it\nopen(NEWCONFIG, \">$icons_file\") or die(\"Can't open $icons_file for writing!!\");\n\nmy $row_count = 0;\nmy $col_count = 0;\n\nforeach my $icon (@icons) {\n## on my particular desktop (1440x900 monitor) there are 8 rows...

When it opens, click on + sign from the right side of the window to add a new custom action. In Basic tab, complete all the fields as follow:\n\nThe most important thing is to put the right path to the script in Command field. Also you can add an icon if you wish.\nIn Appearance conditions tab you have only to tick the Desktop field.\n\nPress Ok, then Close.\n3. Arrange desktop icons by name from right click menu\nTo see the new option Arrange Desktop Icons by Name in the right click menu on the desktop, you don't need to reboot your system or re-login. Just run the following command in terminal:\nxfdesktop --reload\n\nAfter all of these, you can enjoy:\n\n\nA: I have found 2 scripts 1 from here, and 2 from here, that the are  claimed to arrange the desktop icons. \nStill searching for how to make a menu element for it, perhaps this could help you for the time being.\nThanks.\n\nA: Note: Xubuntu 13.04 its not there as well, but in Ubuntu 13.04, with the Xfce Desktop Environment, its available.\n \nXFCE4 does not have (to my knowledge) a click-able \"align icons\" function. Instead, it uses a grid of invisible boxes on the desktop which you can either click and drag icons 'into' or 'out of'. When you relocate a desktop icon by click and drag, you should momentarily see the outline of the grid box, which the icon will automatically center into.\nIf you want you're icons all in a row, or rows, you have to manually move them to where you want them. The icon \"size\" determines how many rows and columns of icon positions you can have on your desktop. Smaller icon sizes allow for more rows and columns, larger, less.\nSystem > Settings > Desktop Settings > Behavior to get to the icon sizing function. The desktop icon positions are configured (stored) in ~/.config/xfce4/desktop/icons.screen0.rc.\nNow I found a way that will arrange the icon automatically at login, but it only worked for me sometimes, and others it didn't.

I want the background color to change to the ones given on that theme wiki page. \nSo, how do I do change the background color automatically to the ones on that page whenever I change my theme?\n\nA: For example, I changed in ~/.oh-my-zsh/themes/example.zsh-theme file the line:\nPROMPT=\"%{$fg[red]%}%n%{$reset_color%}@%{$fg[blue]%}%m %{$fg[yellow]%}%~ %{$reset_color%}%% \"\n\nwith the line:\nPROMPT=\"%{$bg[cyan]%}%{$fg[red]%}%n%{$reset_color%}%{$bg[cyan]%}@%{$fg[red]%}%m %{$fg[yellow]%}%~ %{$reset_color%}%{$bg[cyan]%}%% \"\n\nAnd look what happened:\n\nSo, I suggest you to play in the same manner with which theme do you wish from  ~/.oh-my-zsh/themes directory.\n\nA: Right click on your terminal and there click on preferences option, it will open a new window; in the new window goto tab colors and there uncheck the checkbox \"Use colors from system theme\", doing this will load the background of your theme, we can also change further stylings from here.

I am new to Linux, and am trying to setup a \"Localhost\" dynamic for basic website design.\nIn windows - I had used a simple free utiliy called XAMPP which installed  Apache, MySQL, and a Localhost folder for my wesite work to reside.  Though basic, this XAMPP install worked pretty good for my needs. Is there some stable utility in the Ubuntu depositories that will give me Apache and MySQL servers with a\" htdocs(localhost)\" folder where I can put websites that are under construction - (something similar to XAMPP) ?\nIf not - instruction on how to manually configure this dynamic would be much appreciated.\nAlso, would welcome suggestions as to which is better. Thanks.\n\nA: Check this out. LAMP means \"Linux Apache MySQL, PHP\". \nhttp://www.howtoforge.com/ubuntu_lamp_for_newbies\n\nA: LAMPP/XAMPP is probably also available for Linux.\nBut you can also install all things individually from the repositories (it's just a little bit harder). \nTo install Apache, PHP, MySQL and phpMyAdmin, run the following command in the terminal:\nsudo apt-get install apache2 mysql-server mysql-client php5 php5-mysql libapache2-mod-php5 phpmyadmin\n\nYou could also use Synaptic Package Manager to install these packages (it's graphical and easy to use). You can find it in the Software Center (if not installed already).\nAfter that, open your browser and point it to localhost to see if Apache is working and localhost/phpmyadmin to see if phpMyAdmin is working. Apache should have started automatically.\nYou can start/stop/restart the Apache server by using the commands (respectively):\nsudo service apache2 start\nsudo service apache2 stop\nsudo service apache2 restart\n\nThe folder where the websites (html files, php files, etc.) should go is /var/www.\nNote that you can't create/delete files in that folder directly (because you don't have write access).\nAn easy solution is to create a folder for each website as root and set yourself as owner:\nsudo mkdir \"/var/www/SITE_NAME\"\nsudo chown YOUR_USERNAME:YOUR_USERNAME \"/var/www/SITE_NAME\"\n\nChange SITE_NAME to the name of the folder you want and YOUR_USERNAME to your username.\nAfter that you should be able to do everything inside the folder you created.\nThen you would access the website in the browser through the URL localhost/SITE_NAME.\n", "Q: using old spare laptop as a monitor Just got a new laptop and installed ubuntu on it. I have an old one that also runs ubuntu.\nIs there a way I can use the old laptop as an additional screen for the work I do on my new laptop?\nI saw some solutions for Windows, but who wants to use Windows.\n\nA: Here is a really, really hacky way (and only a high-level description) of doing this.\n\n\n*\n\n*On the new laptop use xrandr to increase the size of the screen to cover both monitors. If each laptop is 1920x1080 you would run:\nxrandr --fb 3840x1080\n\nIf one screen is bigger, pick the biggest dimensions or you'll cut some off.\n\n*Run a VNC server on your new laptop. xllvnc is nice and supports clipping (amongst other things). Clipping allows you to send just the portion of the screen you want to and in this case we want to send the stuff we can't see on the first screen:\nx11vnc -clip 1920+1080+1920+0\n\n\n*Run a VNC client on the old laptop. Assuming you set the resolution correctly in step 2, just make it fullscreen and bam, you're done.\nThis is going to give you relatively awful performance (you can tweak this in the x11vnc command) and artefacts (from the jpeg compression) but it should just about work.\n\nA better solution (in my mind) would be ripping the screen off the old laptop and buying a controller board for it and just plugging it into the external display port on the new laptop.\nThat or flog the old laptop and buy a monitor. They're not expensive.\n", "Q: How to fix a mobile modem that worked with Ubuntu 12.10 but doesn't with 13.04?

I have searched Google, Software Center, Synaptic Manager, and, several forums. I have tried xset, xinput, xconfig (sp), and creating text files. Nothing is working, does anyone know of any other way of adjusting the speed? It would also be nice if I could change function of a couple of buttons, but this is not something I'm going to spend alot of time on. Any help would be greatly appreciated. \nI want it slow when doing precise work, and fast when moving across the screen. I am a complete noob and need someone to explain how to use the tools not just point me to a command line. Thanks\n\nA: It might help if you provided specific information such as what product you are using, and what commands or values you tried in these tools.\nI just bought a Kensington Expert Mouse and it was relatively easy to adjust the ball track speed with \n$xset m 1 10\n\nThe first number is sensitivity and the second number is a threshold for acceleration to kick in (sorta like turbo). If you set acceleration 0 then is provides gradient acceleration (the faster you move it the faster it zips away). Does xset do anything for you or does it not do enough? try setting really high like 5 and then back down to 0.\n\nA: I also just got my first trackball and found the sensitivity to be too high. I have a logitech Ergo Mx. I installed solaar on ubuntu 21.10 and it allowed me to lower the sensitivity settings.\nFYI: I answered \"No\" to the pop-up (asking me to use plugdev), and then unplugged and re-plugged the USB dongle (when requested by the solaar gui).\n", "Q: Script to add static ip to network interfaces I've got a little script here that should be pretty self explanatory but I can't figure out why the while loop doesn't handle the functions right.

I have a new external USB drive I plan to use for storing backups only. (It is a WD Red 2TB NAS Hard Drive SATA III model WD20EFRX mounted in a USB enclosure.)\nThe drive came without a partition table. I partitioned it with gdisk (GPT).\nShould I use the btrfs file system? I'm using btrfs on my internal HDD and it has been trouble-free since I first installed Kubuntu 12.04 last year.\nBut I'm wondering if it would be smarter to partition this backup storage drive with ext4.\nFYI, it seems like the arguments that btrfs is not production ready are old. Here's some info I found.\nMatthias Eckermann, senior product manager at SUSE Enterprise Linux, says that Btrfs is ready for production systems, and as of SUSE Linux Enterprise 11 SP2 Btrfs is officially supported.\nAlso, according to the btrfs wiki, \"since February 2012 there are two vendors who support btrfs in their distributions, Oracle and SUSE.\"\n\nA: According to the principle designer of BTRFS, BTRFS still has some issues as filesystems become full. The send/receive functionality to send/receive snapshot differences for offsite backup also is not fully functional yet, and online deduplication (useful for backing up virtual machine images) is going to happen maybe for the 3.11 kernel (not yet released). raidz support was new for 3.10 and I haven't had a chance to test it yet, I may do that this evening. All in all, BTRFS is still under very  active development, and I prefer to wait until it's finished (or at least not getting major functionality improvements with each kernel release!) before actually using it in production. \nThe advantage of using BTRFS or ZFS on an external enclosure used for rsync-based backups is that you can make snapshots via e.g. a daily cron job, and then do time travel to retrieve old data if necessary (if, say, files have disappeared from your hard drive for unknown reasons and you need to get them back from past backups). I use a USB3 enclosure with ZFSonLinux for that purpose because I need de-duplication support for virtual machines (since the big .img file is always different from the perspective of rsync, de-duplication means that only the actual changed blocks in the .img file get changed on the backup rather than multiple copies of huge 30gb files). Hopefully when the 3.12 kernel comes out the BTRFS deduplication support will be mature enough that I can migrate away from ZFS for this application -- ZFS is cool and all, but the fact that it is not integrated with the Linux kernel causes issues (e.g., I use a Centos 6.4 virtual machine to do the backups because ZFS won't compile against the 3.10 kernel). \nFor backing up Linux filesystems, create a snapshot on your BTRFS (or LVM) and mount the snapshot (if LVM) and back it up via rsync. That assures that you'll have a consistent backup as of the snapshot time. Then when finished with the snapshot, delete it. (More important with LVM since snapshots have a significant performance impact there). My cron script that fires off the backup job also does the rotation of the snapshots (daily, weekly, monthly) on my ZFS backup filesystem before it starts actually backing up, so that I can time travel if needed.\nAs far as reliability, hoary old ext4 is probably the most reliable filesystem because of the way it statically allocates structures on disk, meaning you can always find them and at least get most of your data back if things crash badly. The downside is poor performance on edge cases of very large files (where the way inode chain blocks work make random access in those files very slow), issues with large filesystems (which are very slow to create and fsck), or the edge case of large numbers of small files (which exhaust the inode table). I personally continue to run ext4 on top of LVM on top of RAID for my root filesystems and use other filesystems either for performance reasons or for functionality reasons as required. \n", "Q: Installing edubuntu 13-04 on usb without downloading any other iso's than what I already have I have the Edubuntu-13.04-dvd-amd64 iso, and the wubi installer, but can't get the installer to use the iso and put edubuntu on my 14 GB flashdrive. Is it possible to install edubuntu on my flashdrive using just the files that I already have without downloading any others?(internet is slow)  Note that I got wubi on a 4 GB flashdrive using Universal-USB-Installer-1.9.3.7   Also note that I used saucy-desktop-i386 iso to download wubi.\n\nA: Use the Edubuntu liveCD and install it to your flash drive. You can run the liveCD in VirtualBox without having to burn the disk image.\n", "Q: What is the functional difference between sudo su and sudo -i? Why is one preferred over the other in this example?\nsudo su\necho \"options iwlwifi 11n_disable=1\" >> /etc/modprobe.d/iwlwifi.conf\nexit\n\nPlease provide links to Ubuntu documentation.\n\nA: The sudo su command stands for \"switch user\", and allows you to become another user.  It allows a permitted user to execute a command as the superuser or another user, as specified in the sudoers file.\nThe ‑i (simulate initial login) option runs the shell specified by the password database entry of the target user as a login shell. This means that login-specific resource files such as .profile or .login will be read by the shell. If a command is specified, it is passed to the shell for execution via the shell's ‑c option. If no command is specified, an interactive shell is executed.\nSource:ManPage\n\nA: sudo su only changes the current user to root. Environment settings (like PATH) remain the same.\nsudo -i creates a fresh environment as if root had just logged in.\nThe difference is more noticeable if you use other users. After sudo su bob you will be bob, but in the same place. After sudo -i -u bob you will be bob, in bob's home directory, with bob's default shell and with bob's .profile and any other login scripts having been run.\nSee man sudo for more details of what -i does. Unfortunately, man su is light on details.\n\nFound a version of man su (from login-1:4.1.4.2+svn3283-3ubuntu5.1) that has the following to say:\n\n$PATH reset according to the /etc/login.defs options ENV_PATH or ENV_SUPATH (see below);\n$IFS reset to “<space><tab><newline>”, if it was set.\nNote that the default behavior for the environment is the following:\nThe $HOME, $SHELL, $USER, $LOGNAME, $PATH, and $IFS environment variables are reset.\nIf --login is not used, the environment is copied, except for the variables above.\nIf --login is used, the $TERM, $COLORTERM, $DISPLAY, and $XAUTHORITY environment variables are copied if they were set.\nOther environments might be set by PAM modules.\n\nSo whether and to what extent sudo su changes the environment depends on your distribution and setup. Thus sudo -i is theoretically more portable.\n\nA: The main problem is one of (not so) sane environment settings.\nUsing sudo su the new shell gets its environment from the user who issues the command - which may be problematic.\nWith sudo -i you get a clean root shell.\nSee Special notes on sudo and shells\nRemains to observe that it is rarely necessary at all to create a root shell.\n", "Q: GDBus.Error:org.freedesktop.DBus.Error.UnknownMethod I am getting the following error \n\nGDBus.Error:org.freedesktop.DBus.Error.UnknownMethod: No such\n  interface `org.gnome.SettingsDaemon.XRANDR_2' on object at path\n  /org/gnome/SettingsDaemon/XRANDR\n\nwhenever I try to apply any changes to the Display setting in the Ubutnu 12.04.

Why?\n\nA: I think you're confusing libraries with packages\nWhen you install a package like rthlibs via the apt package management system, as far as I know it doesn't look directly at what individual libraries you have installed on the system - instead, it looks at what prerequisite packages you have already installed. So, for example, if you installed the Qt5 libraries by building them from source, then apt-get will not know that those dependencies are satisfied, and will still want to install the packages listed in the 'depends' section of the rthlib package. If those packages contain versions of libraries that conflict with the ones already on your system, then apt-get may not be able to resolve those conflicts and the installation will fail.\nAlso, 'linking' has a specific meaning in relation to libraries - ldconfig doesn't actually link anything, it just tells the dynamic loader where to look for the specified libraries.\n", "Q: Ubuntu compatible laptops I am looking to buy either of the following two laptops but wanted to ensure they were compatible with Ubuntu.

Dell desktop computer\n\n*Ubuntu 12.04 is the ONLY OS installed\n\n*Mem: 1.5GiB\n\n*Processor: Intel Pentium 4 2.8GHz\n\n*OS type: 32 bit\n\n*Disk: 37.8GB\n\n\nBackground info\nI moved my desktop into another room without access to the ethernet cord I previously was using. I was hoping it would be a simple thing to get a wireless card to access the internet with this computer, but it has been difficult and I haven't had success yet. \nI tried 3 different wireless USB adapters; unfortunately, I can't remember all of the details of those 3 because I already returned them to the store since I couldn't get them to work. I know that the companies were Belkin, Linksys and Netgear. I was trying to use the instructions on this and other various sites to download drivers, using the program (WINE), but honestly I am a complete newbie at all of this and didn't know what I was doing (I still don't), so I don't know exactly what I installed or where it is.  \nI finally returned them all of the failed-attempt wireless cards to the store and ordered a D-Link Wireless N Nano USB adapter online, after I had originally looked for the USB wireless adapters from this site: https://www.thinkpenguin.com/catalog/wireless-networking-gnulinux \nUnfortunately, I think Amazon sent me the wrong one because the D-Link I have in front of my says nothing about being compatible with Linux; so I'm probably going to send it back and try again for a Linux supported wireless USB adapter (what I THOUGHT I ordered from Amazon). \nQuestion\nthe latest wireless router instructs me to uninstall all previous related programs. Since I installed them using the Ctrl+Alt+T and didn't know what I was doing, I cannot find them to uninstall them with the USC. I tried the command:\napt-get --purge remove linksye\n\nas well as other possible program names, but I don't even know what the actual program names were. I don't know how to find them, either. \nSo my guess is I need to:\n\n\n*\n\n*Find out what the names of the 3 programs were\n\n*Uninstall them - all using the Terminal\n\n\nI have no idea how to do this. Help please? \n\nA: Using WINE to install drivers for a wireless card will almost certainly not work, as you ideally want the hardware to interface with your OS natively. I'd suggest looking for linux versions of the drivers rather than attempting to use Windows versions wrapped in WINE.\nAs for removing the drivers, a good place to start would be to look in whatever directory you have set up for WINE to use as it's C:\\ drive, and look in the standard folders there (e.g. C:\\Program Files\\, etc.), and you should be able to just delete those folders.\nAlternatively, you could just remove the whole folder you have set up as your WINE C:\\ drive and reinstall, though you need to be careful that you won't remove any other programs you've installed using WINE.\n", "Q: Active download does not supersede suspend I'm using Ubuntu 13.04.\nMy system is set to suspend after 10 minutes of idle time. I like this, but if I have a download going, the system will go into suspend anyway and the download will pause. \nIf I want to start a big download and go AFK for a while, do I really have to go into the power settings and disable suspend? This doesn't seem like it should be necessary. Surely, Ubuntu is supposed to prevent automatic suspension, or continue the download in the background, while the system is suspended. \nThis happens with Firefox, Chromium, and Synaptic Package Manager. I haven't tried to replicate this problem with other applications that include a download function, but those three are the ones I use the most. \nIs there a way to fix this?\nAlso, I'm worried that if I was to be installing a big package and went AFK for >10 minutes, that process would get suspended too, and damage the installation. \n\nA: First of all, a Suspended System only preserves your RAM data,would not continue processing because thats what suspending means.\nSo no way of continuing download if system is on suspend mode.\nWhat can be done is:\n\n\n*\n\n*Disable suspend  (System settings->Power->Don't suspend when inactive for)\n\n*Just lock screen(Ctrl+Alt+L) if you go off the system.\n\n*System continues to process whatever it's set for.\nNOTE: You need to change POWER SETTINGS only if you put system on suspend(while inactive).\n", "Q: Using Python 3.3 on Kubuntu 13.04 I am starting with my first Python project and choose to go with version 3.3 of the language. I'm doing this on a Kubuntu 13.04 x64 box. I appear to have both 2.7 and 3.3 installed (at /usr/bin/python and /usr/bin/python3.3).\nNow I want to use some existing python packages (such as python nose) in my project. I tried installing nose using pip, but it looks like it is now installed for 2.7, and not 3.3.\nCan I change the main python version of my system to 3.3 (which it breaking horribly - I know stuff in Ubuntu uses python, so am rather concerned this breaking my system). And if not, how can I best get the packages that I need to work on my 3.3 project?\n\nA: In Ubuntu, you should the apt (Advanced Package Manager) to install related libraries without breaking the system, since pip may not know where exactly it should be look for dependencies, libraries and such. Simply running:\nsudo apt-get install python-nose\n\nshould be enough. You can also check the libraries section in the Ubuntu Software Center for more... libraries. If you aren't sure if Ubuntu includes the library, you can search the package list here: http://packages.ubuntu.com/\n\nA: The simple solution is to use python virtualenv, and running a seperate environment with python 3.3. There seem to be some minor issues setting it up based on the version\nof ubuntu if you use the package version. You can then run a seperate, purely python environment, using pip to install packages, without totally blowing up your main system.\n", "Q: Install on mSATA that is seen as \"sdb\"?

In fact, Ubuntu don't use those identifiers since they can change with addition/removing of drives, but use a UUID, which in plain words is a Unique Identifier for the partition/drive.\n", "Q: How to get Windows booting after uninstalling Ubuntu? I had a dual boot with Ubuntu 13.04+ Windows 8, Windows 8 being the primary system. I decided I don't need Ubuntu at the moment, so I wanted to uninstall it. Here are the steps I took.\n\n\n*\n\n*Used EasyBCD to write Windows into the MBR\n\n*Deleted the Linux partitions, and expanded my C:\\ drive to take the free space\n\n\nAfter doing these steps, my Windows HDD was back to normal, and I had more GB's as expected. When I tried to reboot, I get the error: no such partition, with a grub command prompt. I'm assuming this is because my computer had grub as the default bootloader set, and since I erased Ubuntu, it doesn't know what to do. How do I boot back into Windows? I don't have access to my Windows 8 disk, but I do have a USB key with Ubuntu 13.04 live on it.\n\nA: The answer depends on whether the system was booting with BIOS or with EFI. vfbsilva's answer might work with BIOS-based computers. (It definitely works with old versions of Windows, but I'm not sure if the same procedure works with Windows 8.)\nThe vast majority of new computers that ship with Windows 8 are EFI-based. On such a computer, you need to restore the Windows boot loader to be the primary one and/or delete GRUB from the EFI System Partition (ESP). You can set the Windows boot loader to be the primary one in various ways, but unfortunately, they all take a lot of explaining and/or are tricky to do. Deleting GRUB from the ESP is relatively easy to explain, so I'll do that:\n\n\n*\n\n*Boot a Linux live CD.\n\n*Identify your ESP by typing sudo parted /dev/sda print and locating the partition with the \"boot flag\" set.\n\n*Mount the ESP by typing sudo mount /dev/sda1 /mnt (substituting the correct device identifier for /dev/sda).\n\n*Type sudo rm -r /mnt/EFI/ubuntu to remove Ubuntu's version of GRUB. If you've manually installed GRUB somewhere else, remove it instead of or in addition to Ubuntu's GRUB.\n\n*Reboot.\n\n\nWhen you reboot with GRUB absent, the computer will bypass that no-longer-functional entry and use the next one in its list, which should be the Windows boot loader.\nA caveat: If you've used Boot Repair, you may need to re-run it and use its advanced options to undo its renaming operations. If you fail to do this, you'll end up still running your non-functional GRUB.\n\nA: Go to the windows cd, repair and in a command shell do fdisk /mbr the grub is still there in mbr but no longer finds it files which were inside the ubuntu partition. \n\nfdisk /mbr\n\nWill fix the windows loader writting it to the mbr.\n", "Q: Command prompt in nautilus window I am on an Acer Aspire 5920, running Ubuntu 12.04 32 bit.\nEarlier, by mistake, I exited a terminal during:\nsudo apt-get upgrade\n\nThe computer said there were internal errors, and I should restart.

I am trying out linux for the first time. I have ubuntu 13.04 installed and working very well. However the computer I am trying ubuntu on happens to have 2TB of storage that was shared via Windows using samba shares. I set up samba, and have the folders on my NTFS drive shared via Samba but for the life of me I can't seem to figure out how to give certain users read-only access while granting my user full access. Can anyone give me any help on this?\n\nA: Samba permissions work like this: operation on file needs to be allowed by BOTH samba user permissions and by underlying filesystem permissions\nset the permissions of the samba share to be readable by others (chmod -R o+r)\nthen give your user read write permissions in samba and the other user read only access. (it's quite straightforward from the samba config gui)\ngood luck!\n", "Q: Logitech Z-5 Speakers I have a set of USB Logitech Z-5 Speakers and they do Not Work with Ubuntu 12.04LTS, yet they work with Fedora 19.

While I installed ubuntu 12.04 (64 bit) on my system, I attached 2gb ram to only one slot.\nNow, after weeks I've attached another 2gb ram to another slot. Ubuntu does not detect 4gb of memory in total. It just detects 2gb. Do we need to install additional ram using some command? \nIn BIOS there is a note something like: memory used is less than available. Note that some OS may not use complete memory.\n\nA: Ubuntu uses all the available RAM detected by your BIOS - there are no special commands that need to be given to detect additional RAM. In this case the problem seems to be that your BIOS is not using the added memory. \nFirst, try using another slot for the memory. This might show if the used memory slot is defective. Then you should try if it is detected by another, compatible, computer. If not, it is likely defective.\n", "Q: Qt build in Ubuntu 12.04 I have installed Qt Creator 2.7.2 'Based on Qt 5 1.0 (32 bit)'.

(This was on a fresh install of AutoKey.) \n\n*Then I created an empty file org.autokey.Service under /usr/share/dbus-1/services\n\n*In the org.autokey.Service file I put the following text:\n[D-BUS Service] \nName=org.autokey.Service \nExec=/usr/bin/autokey</code>\n\n\n*Then I killed AutoKey via the taskmanager (AK already hang), and restarted AutoKey\n\n*Tested it, and it works.

However, the developers have plans to implement it in the future.\n\nbtrfs subvolume create data will do that for me, but I'm curious why it keeps naming it @/data (or similar things when I try /data or @data)\n\nBy default, Ubuntu's installer Ubiquity creates subvolumes @ and @home in the filesystem, and your Ubuntu root is actually in the subvolume @.\n\nIs there a special way to create the subvolumes like @ and @home so my data subvolume will show up as @data? (and: what is the exact difference between the naming schemes?)\n\n@ and @home are arbitrary names chosen by the installer, that have no meaning outside /etc/fstab. In fact, I typically rename them to more specific names, so that I can have many Ubiquity-installed distros on the same btrfs, as long as I remember to update their fstab's. \nMore subvolume explanation at Funtoo.org - BTRFS.\n\nA: Sigh, seems I posted a bit too soon, with a bit of help of the almighty Zosma on IRC, we found out how this is supposed to work.\nSubvolumes @ and @home are children of the btrfs root, so / is not actually the root of the file system. The UUID of the btrfs root is supplied in /etc/fstab twice, providing the mounts for / and /home. Mounting the actual root of the file system shows the subvolumes created by the installer:\nroot@box:~# mkdir /mnt/btrfs\nroot@box:~# mount UUID=f8963df3-1320-4bc0-a125-62be185b029e /mnt/btrfs\nroot@box:~# ls /mnt/btrfs\n@  @home\n\nSo that's where they went! Creating a new subvolume in the exact way the ubuntu installer did is now easy:\nroot@box:~# btrfs subvolume create /mnt/btrfs/@data\nCreate subvolume '/mnt/btrfs/@data'\n\nNow, as we've created a subvolume in the btrfs root instead of in the root filesystem for the install, /data/ won't show up by itself. Luckily, it's trivial to copy the trick used by the installer by examining /etc/fstab and add another mount for /data:\nUUID=f8963df3-1320-4bc0-a125-62be185b029e /data  btrfs  defaults,subvol=@data 0 2\n\nLast step is to create the mount point: mkdir /data. After a reboot, we'll have a /data directory mounted from a separate btrfs subvolume.\n… Profit!\n", "Q: Brightness Control In Samsung RV 509 I have recently installed Ubuntu 12.04 on my Samsung laptop RV509 with Nvidia grahics card but brightness remain unchanged.

It only shows detected devices. If your device turns up, it means that it's plugged in and not completely dead, but it doesn't imply that the device is working correctly.\nIf lspci -k or lspci -v reports that your device is in use by a driver, that usually implies that the driver was able to complete some form of initialization.

I have Ubuntu 13.04 and I wanted to ask that why the setup files of software in Ubuntu have so many dependencies while Windows and Mac doesn't.\nI mean when I download a .deb file of software and take it to my offline machine then  the Software center says that package x or y is missing.  \n\nA: \nPrograms often use some of the same files as each other. Rather than\n  putting these files into each package, a separate package can be\n  installed to provide them for all of the programs that need them. So,\n  to install a program which needs one of these files, the package\n  containing those files must also be installed. When a package depends\n  on another in this way, it is known as a package dependency. By\n  specifying dependencies, packages can be made smaller and simpler, and\n  duplicates of files and programs are mostly removed.\nWhen you install a program, its dependencies must be installed at the\n  same time. Usually, most of the required dependencies will already be\n  installed, but a few extras may be needed, too. So, when you install a\n  package, don't be surprised if several other packages are installed\n  too - these are just dependencies which are needed for your chosen\n  package to function properly.\n\nThe advantage is that you don't accidentally download multiple copies of the same dependencies, which can often be the case with windows. There and installer will often carry copies of the required dependencies, and install them in a separate location. Which will cause problems with the path when the system finds the same thing (or worse the same thing in different versions) in 2 locations.\nSource:Ubuntu Help\n\nA: You're looking at the way of shared libraries work - in this case dependencies. A .deb file is not meant to be portable and installable only by itself.\nRather than including all stuff that a single application needs, the components are separated into individual packages. If another application can reuse them, then it can simply depend on it rather than having multiple copies on your system. It is also a lot better tested software and easier to patch if something is broken in a library. Below I will explain these advantages a bit more.\n\n\n*\n\n*Let's say the JPEG library libjpeg8 contains a serious bug and suppose you are running 12 applications that use this to display JPEG images. Then if a bugfix is rolled out, none of the application have to be patched, but just the libjpeg8 package (which is really small). This saves a lot of work for both the application developers as well as the individual end users installing the updates. This enhances security.\n\n*It will also help to reduce the size of the application package. Let's say you want to install an image viewer and you already have most of the image format libraries installed, then it will significantly reduce the size of the package. Your package management will see that only the few you're missing are required to be installed before the application is working properly. This reduces disk space.\n\n*It's also possible to have optional functionality. Suppose you are developing an application and you want to include a feature, but not everyone needs it. Then you can simply add a \"recommended\" dependency so that the feature will only work if that is installed, but the users not interested don't have to install it. This is especially useful if the dependency is really big. This is how most metapackages work, e.g. texlive-full is a full TexLive installation (1.5GB!) with all recommended fonts, but you can also install texlive-base to have just basic functionality (~100MB). This reduces disk space (if chosen to).\n\n*Then there's the principle of single responsibility in software development. The package has a really clear defined set of functionality it will provide and will do it well. Software will be tested a lot better and more efficient rather than pieces of code included in a large application that contains code to be checked all over. Moreover, a developer doesn't always need to reinvent the wheel. A JPEG library already exist? Then why not reuse it? Reusability enhances development speed and overall software quality.\n\n*Another reason is memory footprint. If a library is already loaded into memory by an application and another wants to use it as well, it doesn't have to be loaded again into memory. So, your image viewer and your web browser will just share the libjpeg8 library already loaded. This reduces loading time and memory.\n\nWindows application are usually very much portable. Most libraries are statically built into the installers and this is why a typical Windows installation is so big. Also patches have to be rolled out for application individually, so that's one reason for why you see so many individual updaters e.g. \"Adobe Updater\", \"HP updater\", \"Java updater\", etc. Clearly, this is much less efficient.\n", "Q: How to read file contents in QML My app require reading contents from a file. Can you do it using QML alone? Or should I use C++ for it ?\n\nA: I suppose the answer is no. QML doesn't provide any API to access local files. You can use it in combination with either javascript to or c++ in Qt. I suppose it depends on what you're trying to open and interpret because QML also will have limited support for parsing the data you read in.\nA plain text file being read through javascript\nFile i/o in c++\n\nA: You can read local text files using XMLHttpRequest in QML.  However, this lacks all of the features of XMLHttpRequest2 and some of the of version 1, which makes it impossible, as far as I can tell, to read in binary files.\nTo get around this, I wrote a C++ plugin for QML for reading files.  It still can't work with binary files directly, but it gives an option of reading them in base64 encoding.  I've released this code into the public domain, so do with it what you will.\n\nA: There is built-in file I/O available for QML with the V-Play SDK FileUtils.

First of all, if you are using the nvidia proprietary driver, there are two issues I have noticed: \n\n\n*\n\n*The start animation (the one showing the Ubuntu logo with the dots), doesn't fully work. I've read that the nvidia proprietary driver doesn't fully support the screen resolution on the start window (don't ask me why). \n\n*Some custom controls of your notebook (especially brightness control) don't work at all with nvidia's proprietary driver.\nHowever, on the login screen, animations work better with the proprietary driver than with the nouveau driver, or in general, all animations and graphic stuff work better with the proprietary driver, apart from those mentioned earlier.\nSo the optimal solution is for instance to use the nouveau open source driver if you don't need high graphics performance, or else, just deal with the fact that you won't be able to change the screen brightness, at least not easily.\n", "Q: Boot from USB in a COMPAQ Presario B1800 I just bought a second hand laptop, COMPAQ Presario B1800.

Open the folder Windows.\n\n*You will find the batch program InstallToMBR. Run it as administrator in VISTA/WIN7 (right mouse click on the file and choose \"Run as administrator\").\n\n*The batch creates an entry in your windows boot menu called \"Install the Plop Boot Manager to the MBR\".\n\n*Reboot and select the \"Install the Plop Boot Manager to the MBR\", reboot again.\n\n*Once this is done, you will have a menu similar to the above image, as you can read the last option is USB.

This could be a choice for you as well, if you want a little more control over your disk.\nIf you're unsure about partitioning, go with option 2.\nAlso, be ready for a learning curve, as with any new operating system.  However, you will really appreciate being able to use your computer without the viruses.\n\nA: Download Ubuntu, create a bootable CD/DVD or a bootable USB flash drive.  Boot form whichever one you create, and once you get to the installation type screen, choose replace Windows with Ubuntu.\nIf you're comfortable with dealing with partitions, then you can choose something else, delete any existing partitions, and then create a Ext4 partition mounted at / and a swap partition.\nFor more information on how to install Ubuntu see Install Ubuntu\n\n\nA: Yes of course you can.\nAnd to clear your hard drive you do not need an external tool.\nYou just have to download the Ubuntu iso, write it to a disk, boot from it, and when installing choose the option wipe the disk and install Ubuntu.\n\nA: You are now in the place that I was in about a year ago!

List what you need from your Windows disk, for example:\n\n\n*\n\n*Your CV\n\n*All business letters/spreadsheets/databases/ebooks/manuals/downloads\n\n*All photos & music\n\n*Important emails that are not also with the email service provider\n\n\nNext, decide where are you going to put them. Depending on the space required, you could use a free account with dropbox - 2+GB. Another 15GB with Google drive; 1TB (yes, that's 1000GB or 1000000MB) for your photos with flickr. If required/preferred, use an external USB drive, as they are cheap enough now. Boot from a Linux DVD and do the copying under Linux. You will be able to scan the files for viruses under Linux later. Then follow Mitch's instructions to Replace Windows.\nYou will experience niggles and doubts but stick with an LTS (Long Term Support) release of Ubuntu so you don't get the recently-added-but-not-thoroughly-tested enhancements and additions. Find alternative programs to allow you to what you do with Windows. There's a lot to choose from sometimes but you can ask advice on the forums like these. Good luck!\n\nA: If you have the space on your hard drive, I would recommend keeping your Windows installation and creating new swap and ext4 partitions for your new Ubuntu installatio.  \nIn other words, choose Install Ubuntu alongside Windows when asked, since you surely have some documents, music, photos &c. in your Windows install that you'd like to save.  Once you have successfully installed Ubuntu, you can copy over anything you want to save from your Windows partition into your ext4 partition.  (Ext4 is the filesystem used by Ubuntu; Windows uses NTFS, a proprietary Microsoft filesystem.)  \nAfter you've finished moving the files you want to save, you can remove your Windows partition and enlarge the ext4 space by booting from a live USB or DVD and using the gParted tool, which comes with the Ubuntu live system by default.\nYou may need to update your GRUB (GRand Unified Bootloader) after resizing your ext4 partition. I've used instructions for doing so from this post on Ubuntu forums with unqualified success.  I also migrated to Ubuntu 12.04 after having used Windows exclusively my entire life, and I cannot express how much more satisfied I am with Ubuntu's performance.\n", "Q: How does the automatic installation work with free space? I want to install Ubuntu 13.04 (Raring Ringtail) I have Windows 7 installed, so I unallocated some disk space (~20gb). \nI have used other versions of Ubuntu and in those versions there was an option \"Use Free Space\" and if I check that option it installs Ubuntu in the free space. \nNow for the installation of Ubuntu 13.04 there are just 3 options which are \"install alongside Windows 7\", \"Remove Windows 7 and install Ubuntu\" and \"Something else\"\nSo my query is, if I select the \"install alongside Windows 7\" option does it automatically install Ubuntu into the unallocated space?\n\nA: Yes, the \"Install Ubuntu alongside Windows 7\" option will install Ubuntu in the free, unallocated space, provided that it can be created as a partition (for example, if you already have 4 primary partitions + unpartitioned space, Ubuntu will not be able to install).\nThe \"Install Ubuntu alongside Windows 7\" will usually reserve space for a swap partition. This space is usually the size of your RAM. So, for example, if your RAM is 4GB, then picking the \"alongside\" option will automatically partition your 20GB unpartitioned space to 16GB for the root partition (Ubuntu), and 4GB for swap.\n\nA: I can't say that whether install along with windows 7 will use the unallocated space or not.\nBetter way to install would be to custom partition by choosing the option-\n'Something else'\nThen the Gparted application will open up and you can see the partitions and unallocated space on the disk(s).\nSimplest Configuration-\n1 swap partition 2 gb\n1 / partion 18 gb( all space left unallocated)\nTo achieve the above right click the unallocated space, click on new.\nSelect partition size as 2048 mb, partiton type as 'linux-swap' click on create.\nThen right click the remaining unallocated space left and select new.\nPartiton size- as it is (it should be around 18000 mb). partition type- ext4\nmount point - /\nThats it for the partitioning.\nClick on install to proceed furthur.\n", "Q: Wine Errors in Ubuntu 12.10 driving me crazy I have an Hp Pavilion dv7 64bit system, 6gb memory, Ubuntu 12.10 partitioned with Win7,AMD Phenom(tm) II N640 Dual-Core Processor × 2 , 650g HDD.\nThis is what i'm getting through Terminal, same type of warning when going through software center.

I get a Brother printer that says it is connected via USB. If I search for a network printer, my printer is shown. If I select it and select the correct driver, I can submit test pages. These pages are however not printed.\nWhat could be wrong. Should it really be that much harder then it is on Windows?\n\nA: I had exactly the same problem brother using the CUPS and LPR drivers and trying to install them through the UBUNTU printer install interface.

And if no, why? Thank you!\n\nA: Current status (Sept 2015)\n\n\n*\n\n*Skype: A web app exists and provides Skype's original implementation available from web.skype.com, with messaging working but no voice and video calls yet. Skype/Microsoft are working on it. As soon as their web version fully works on Linux desktops it will work on Ubuntu Touch too. (Say hello to convergence!)\n\n*Hangouts: A native app is fresh in the making, it's called \"Ubuntu Hangups\" and uses an Open Source library to access Google's proprietary protocol for instant messaging (no voice, no video calls). Messaging already works fine. Google's own implementation is available as a terrible, mostly useless web app. Google doesn't even care to make the web version responsive. (Shame on them!)\n\n*Facebook: No native app yet, but the web app by Mitchell Reese (not the one by Canonical) works great. Most of the kudos must go to Facebook, of course.\n\n*Google Maps and other mapping apps: They work fine as web apps on Ubuntu Touch. Not bad, really, GPS flawlessly included. Just as in your web browser on the desktop.\n\n*eBook Readers: There's a native app that has quite a few fans, and convincing screenshots.\n\n\nA: You're asking about some specific apps. Most of which have not yet been implemented. Why they haven't been imeplemented is largely due to connecting qml and javascript in with the apis that is provided by skype, googlemaps, facebook, twitter ect. \nFirstly you can find out how to install the Ubuntu Touch core-apps and run them from here and track their progress on the wiki\nBased on your question, I dont think Ubuntu Touch is at the stage you want it to be yet.

I'm considering ditching Windows 8 and doing a fully clean install of Ubuntu. However, I'm concerned because my computer came with a built-in 16 GB recovery partition that would need to be erased as well. \nIf I pick the \"erase entire disk\" option during installation, will it wipe out this recovery partition too?\n\nA: Using the \"Erase entire disk\", will erase all partitions.\nSince you're new, I would recommend to start with dual booting with Windows first. Get used to Ubuntu and then you may decide later to remove Windows completely. This is especially recommended if you do not have recovery media or another means of reinstalling Windows should you wish to.\nIn any case, I would recommend doing a backup of your important data on an external disk before trying to install Ubuntu. If something goes wrong, your data would be safe.\n\nA: Yes, it will.\nI've switched from windows 8 to Ubuntu a lot. It will destroy your recovery partition, but it is worth it. SO WORTH IT! You should totally go through with your Ubuntu installation. You will be happy with what you get from it!\n\nA: If you select the option \"erase entire disk\" option your entire disk partition scheme will be erased and the entire disk space will be alloted to Ubuntu.\nTo prevent this you can try using \"advanced partitioning tool\" during formatting.\n", "Q: change xfce panel launcher icon size I have a panel size of 24 pixels and am trying to make xfce feel like gnome2.

There is still a (slim) chance to recover some (not all) data from the Windows partition using tools like Photorec, but the first thing you need to do is to STOP ALL USE OF THE MACHINE - you're continuing to install programs on your hard drive and using it \"as usual\".

If you have a running linux, mount the persistent partition and fsck it.  If not, on a UEFI machine, you actually will run grub, and can edit the boot lines -- remove the word \"persistent\" on the linux line, boot, and you should have a clean live media boot, mount the partition which you used for persistence and fsck it.  If not a UEFI machine, if you can edit the /syslinux/text.cfg (Not sure of the name) file and find the linux boot line with the word \"persistent\" on it, remove the word persistent. Next boot should be a clean install media, mount other partition and fsck it.\n  If the filesystem is clean, then I don't know what to suggest since you see the problem on multiple machines.  But you can backup the persistent partition, and restore it onto another live media's persistent partition.\n", "Q: Are there any synchronization APIs in Ubuntu Touch yet? (Contacts/Calendar/...)

If I mount with Nautilus, and then type\nmount, I see the following line:\n\n/dev/sdb1 on /media/Data type fuseblk (rw,nosuid,nodev,allow_other,default_permissions,blksize=4096)\n\nI am the owner of all files and permissions are the way I want them (have umask 077 in .bashrc). However, after following the instructions on MountingWindowsPartitions, and adding the following line to fstab\n\nUUID=4A92C07A92C06C4F  /media/Data  ntfs-3g  defaults,windows_names,locale=en_GB.utf8  0 0\n\nthe drive does indeed automatically mount, but all file permissions are -rwxrwxrwx and user and group are both root. The mount command now shows\n\n/dev/sdb1 on /media/Data type fuseblk (rw,nosuid,nodev,allow_other,blksize=4096)\n\nHow do I specify the parameters in fstab so that the partition is mounted exaclty the same way as when I click on the device under Devices in Nautilus? I have Ubuntu 12.04.\n\nA: The fuse mounting done by nautilus has one advantage over system-wide mounts in /etc/fstab: it knows which user is doing the mounting. Assuming you are the only user of your client machine (which is fair enough these days), you can get your numeric UID and GID and default umask with:\n$ id\nuid=1001(msw) gid=1001(msw) groups=…\n$ umask \n0002\n\nthen you'd add these to the options group in fstab\ndefaults,uid=1001,gid=1001,umask=077,windows_names,locale=…\n\nit would be wise, but not required to replace defaults with \nauto,rw,nosuid,nodev,noexec\n\nnautilus assumes that a user mounted partition is \"untrusted\" so flags them this way. A foreign (i.e. NTFS) partition should probably always be viewed with such suspicion.\nadded in response to comment:\nThis is an area where cross-system semantics get weird. The mount.ntfs(8) manual defines fmask and dmask to try to make files created on an NTFS filesystem behave better. Can I ls a directory not owned by me under windows? Should I be able to? Is there any relation between your UID on Linux and Windows? Dunno.\nThere is a usermapping= option for mount.ntfs which supersedes uid, gid, umask, fmask, and dmask. I suggest you look into that if you want fine control on what files are assigned what permissions. I would check to see that you can even access them from the Windows side before committing too much under a usermapping mount.\n", "Q: How can I install Ubuntu on a Windows XP machine that will not connect to the Internet?

I do not have access to a more recent Windows OS install. I can't get 2000 off the hard drive now but I also can't get XP to connect to the Internet. I have heard great things about Ubuntu and figured now is as good a time as any to give it a shot. How can I get Ubuntu on the machine that won't connect to the Internet? I have a Windows 7 laptop that is connected if I have to download onto a DVD-R if needed. Please just tell me how. Thanks!\n\nA: Believe it or not, but this is going to be easier then it may seem. On your Win7 machine, download an ISO Disc Image of Ubuntu, mount it (I think it already mounts it in most Image burning applications), then burn it with your favorite Disc Image Burning Application. Now, on your XP or 2000 or Whatever machine, boot the up the disc drive via the BIOS, then it should come up to setup. \nYou mentioned it would not connect to the Internet, which seems strange if your other laptop can connect. You can always try a WiFi Adapter or Ethernet Cord, but otherwise install Ubuntu and only used the unupdated and otherwise default software. \n", "Q: Why does my ethernet connection fail AFTER installation is complete? I am installing Ubuntu for the first time on an old laptop (Inspiron 6400) and have run into an odd problem right off the bat.  During installation, I am directed to connect the computer to the internet via ethernet cable.  I do this, and have no problem establishing a connection.  I get no warnings or error messages during the install process.\nOnce I am finished installing and log in, I suddenly cannot access the network via ethernet.  At all. \nI tried poking around in the wireless connections but I don't have enough experience to recognize what might be a problem.\nI tried reinstalling the OS and that did nothing.  If anyone has any insight into this problem or even just some guidance on how to troubleshoot, then I would really appreciate the help.\n\nA: Assuming you can get to the desktop, right-click on the NetworkManager icon in the upper right and uncheck \"Enable Wireless\". This should let your wired ethernet act as it did before, and then you might have another questions to ask.\n", "Q: terminal emulator vs terminal I am a having a little trouble understanding the difference between running the terminal emulator from the GUI (gnome) and booting straight into the terminal. I have been a system/network administrator for a little over 10 years and I am very familiar with terminal emulation and how it works on a Windows platform, however I was told by a Linux \"engineer\" that running the terminal emulator from the GUI (as root) would not grant the proper permissions to edit the kernel source code. He said you need to boot to the console and login as root.\n\nA: Booting straight into the terminal means running in the text console. Technically, this console (/dev/console, /dev/tty1, /dev/tty2 and the likes) is just provided by another terminal emulator.\nReal terminals like the famous VT100 used to be connected to computer through serial lines but are now essentially history.\nAbout the kernel editing restriction, I guess you misunderstood what was told by the Linux engineer. Obviously, nothing prevents you to edit a file whatever the terminal emulator used. However, if you want to see console messages while experimenting with a custom kernel, that makes more sense.\n", "Q: will downloading ubuntu erase windows? And what will happen to my files (pictures, documents etc.) Will installing Ubuntu erase Windows? What will happen to my files (pictures, documents etc.) \nWhat will the installation do automatically?\n\nA: There is substantial documentation on dual-booting Ubuntu with Windows which I strongly recommend if you are new to Linux because it allows you to boot your old system if needed.\nBy the time you're ready for your second Ubuntu installation, you'll probably realize that you don't need Windows except possibly as a gaming platform.\n", "Q: Sockets in Ubuntu Touch Apps I am creating an IRC client for the Ubuntu App Showdown. I need a way to be able to access an IRC server in QML (or JavaScript). What is the best way to accomplish this?\n\nA: If there is no QML module that can help you accessing IRC servers, you will probably need to write a QML plugin in C++ that does that work as a backend. You can then use QML to implement the UI frontend.\n\nA: I would try to port irc-chatter (https://github.com/Venemo/irc-chatter) to Ubuntu-touch. Source is written in Qt/Qml (c++, see communiircclient.cpp).\n\nA: Although it is not as performant as the QML solution, you can you IRC-js to communicate with the IRC Server. Here is the GibHub link to the project https://github.com/gf3/IRC-js\n", "Q: What other commands does command passwd involve? I had thought that the passwd command used the mcrypt command to encrypt its input, but instead is it crypt and/or encrypt? The source code of crypt/encrypt is not available.\nWhen am not confusing this - then in earlier times of Linux, was passwd was using the command mcrypt? - Who can enlighten me?\nI am asking this because I want to pimp up my password possibilities.\nTo elaborate on this question:\nThe command passwd asks for your password to be input, then in the background your password will be encrypted, after you finish providing it as input. This encrypted password is stored in the shadow file. I was thinking in earlier days this encryption was performed by mcrypt? Now my question is, what other commands and/or files does the command passwd involve in addition to those of shadow?\n\nA: crypt is a Unix utility. From the link:\nLinux distributions generally do not include a Unix compatible version of the crypt command. This is largely due to a combination of three major factors:\n\n\n*\n\n*crypt is relatively obscure and rarely used for e-mail attachments nor as a file format\n\n*crypt is considered far too cryptographically weak to withstand brute force attacks by modern computing systems (Linux systems generally ship with GNU Privacy Guard which is considered to be reasonably secure by modern standards)\n\n*During the early years of Linux development and adoption there was some concern that even as weak as the algorithm used by crypt was, that it might still run afoul of ITAR's export controls[citation needed]; so mainstream distribution developers in the United States generally excluded it[citation needed] (and left their customers to fetch GnuPG/GPG or other strong cryptographic software from international sites, sometimes providing packages or scripts to automate that process).\n\n\nSource code for crypt can be found on the Unix Archive Sites.\n\nmcrypt is the successor/Linux version of crypt and we have been using this (at least) since Lucid. Replacement for old unix crypt(1) it states at the package details. \nSource code for mcrypt can be found here: mcrypt_2.6.8-1.3_i386.deb on Intel x86 machines\nBut this is not installed in a default Ubuntu.\n\nBut what you are looking for is probably registered in ... \n/etc/login.defs\n\nThis is the place where Linux systems store what to use. By default, for Ubuntu, this is SHA512. So this is not an encryption but a hashed password starting with $6$. \nExample using sha1sum:\n$ echo hello|sha1sum\nf572d396fae9206628714fb2ce00f72e94f2258f  -\n\n-- \nRegarding comment see: http://packages.ubuntu.com/raring/makepasswd That is the one called to make the password from the plain text one.\nHere is a source: http://people.defora.org/~khorben/projects/makepasswd/\nPartial code:\n\nswitch(encryption)\n    {\n        case PE_BASE64:\n            return _hash_base64(password);\n        case PE_BLOWFISH:\n            return _hash_blowfish(password, salt, iterations);\n        case PE_DES:\n            return _hash_des(password, salt);\n        case PE_MD5:\n            return _hash_md5(password);\n        case PE_NONE:\n            return _hash_none();\n        case PE_SHA1:\n            return _hash_sha1(password, salt, iterations);\n        case PE_SHA256:\n            return _hash_sha256(password, salt);\n        case PE_SHA512:\n            return _hash_sha512(password, salt);\n        case PE_SHMD5:\n            return _hash_shmd5(password, salt);\n        default:\n            errno = ENOSYS;\n            _error(\"encryption\", 1);\n            return NULL;\n    }\nall the functions used are below this bit of code.\n", "Q: GameRanger interface not usable in Wine 1.6 I recently moved from a Windows 7 to Ubuntu 12.04, and I play Warcraft III a lot with my friends using GameRanger. So I moved my WC3 to the Wine disk and managed to install GameRanger (after a whole day fighting with winetricks for mfc42.dll). Although some people report not being able to login, it worked perfectly for me. However, when the game and friends list shows up, I am not able to click on anything (in fact, the windows even go out of focus). I can press alt to bring up the toolbar menus, but I cant navigate with keyboard nor mouse. Any ideas how this can be fixed?\n\nA: Well, my solution was simple but overkill: I copied my whole Windows installation over to wine's virtual drive, and it worked.\n", "Q: Can't find or install Canon MP230 on Ubuntu 12.04 I have recently purchased a Canon MP230 for college and I am trying to install it onto my computer which is running Ubuntu 12.04. I have checked the connections and it is switched on.\nI initially couldn't find the printer in system settings. The only options given was URI and Network Printer. Eventually, after installing updates, it found a printer connected through USB. When I searched the database, it didn't have the model of this printer. I tried searching for the PPD file but couldn't find it on the installation disk. (I'm still new to Ubuntu in some aspects). I tried typing the make and model in manually but it wouldn't search for the drivers. I downloaded the drivers from the Canon Europe website, both the Debian 32 bit version and the RPM version. The RPM version wouldn't install at all and the debian I tried running through the Software Center. I tried to access the printer again through system settings and it will not find it as happened before the updates. I proceeded to install through the terminal but it could not find a connected printer. \nI have an art project due in 2 weeks and need the printer and scanner up and running asap.\n\nA: I can instill canon driver (mp230) from \nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:michael-gruz/canon\nsudo apt-get update\n\nthen look for appropriate command at here \nwish it help you :)\n", "Q: GTK+ Themes not showing up I downloaded some themes from gnome-look.org and I extracted and put them in /usr/share/themes folder and when I opened gnome-tweak-tool windows theme was working but GTK+ themes section was showing only the default ones.

I have a host computer (a mac) running two Ubuntu systems as guest machines. I would like to set up an ssh connection between these two virtual machines.\nBoth guest machines are equipped with open-ssh server/client. I have given both guest machines \"Bridge Mode\" so they all have different IP addresses. Have internet connections. But when I try ssh x.x.x.x, it says connection is refused.\nMy understanding is that this can occur due to firewall settings?  Is there a way to solve this??\nIs it even possible to accomplish ssh between two guest machines?? I don't see why not?\n\nA: If you are using VirtualBox (you didn't specify), in the Network settings, select Host-only Adapter for both virtual machines.  They will be able to \"see\" each other.  (You will not be able to access outside the two machines, however).\n", "Q: I need to be able to save my data on my Ubuntu on USB I run Ubuntu on a USB, but it doesn't save my data. Is there a way to save my data?\n\nA: Create your Live USB stick in Ubuntu Startup Disk Creator by selecting the option \"Stored in reserved extra space.\"  Select the amount of extra space you want to use onthe USB stick to store your files and data.\n(As a tip, I like to use the KDE version of Startup Disk Creator, usb-creator-kde, because it seems to work better for me).\nAnother option is to insert a second USB stick while running Ubuntu from the (first) Live USB stick.  Save your files to the second USB stick.\n", "Q: Security updates for the universe repository for LTS releases? What happens if there is a security problem in a package in the universe repository four years after the 12.04 LTS release; will the package be updated from upstream, patched, or left alone?\nIt's my understanding that the \"5 years of support & security updates\" applies only to the core of Ubuntu -- anything in Main repository.  Not for things in the Universe repository.  \nFor a more specific example -- if I install Ruby now, and want to use it for the next several years on 12.04 and it has a security vulnerability; while this might be patched in the upstream (so I could always download the latest from their website and compile it myself or use a PPA), will this upstream fix be migrated into the precise package repositories? What about backports?\n\nA: Packages in Universe are community maintained. Whether or not they get security updates depends entirely on the community who uses them.\nInstructions for contributing security updates for packages in Universe are here:\nhttps://wiki.ubuntu.com/SecurityTeam/UpdateProcedures#Preparing_an_update\nBasically, anybody can file a bug, attach a debdiff, subscribe the ubuntu-security-sponsors team and someone from the team will look at it to make sure it's ok, and then sponsor it to the archive.\n\nA: The example you provided, Ruby, is in the main repository and is supported for five years:\n$ apt-cache show ruby | grep -E \"(^Supported|pool)\"\nFilename: pool/main/r/ruby-defaults/ruby_4.8_all.deb\nSupported: 5y\n\nSee also my answer to \"Does 12.04 LXDE have LTS?\" and How do I get a list of non-LTS packages installed efficiently?.\nFor software from universe, it's not even supported officially at all, let alone for five years. From the Community Wiki on the repositories:\n\nCanonical does not provide a guarantee of regular security updates for software in the universe component, but will provide these where they are made available by the community.\n\nHowever, you can expect most severe issues on popular packages being patched by the community maintaining the software in universe. Just no guarantees.\nFor the backports my view is that these should not be used in production.\n", "Q: How to disable ALT+TAB preview windows in Cinnamon? How do I disable ALT+TAB preview windows in Cinnamon?\nSee this the screenshot, to see what I mean.\n\n\nA: 1) Right click in cinnamon panel > settings > all settings\n\n\n2) In the settings settings window, click in Switch to Advance Mode.\n\n3) Got to Preferences and click in Windows\n\n4) Go to \"Alta-tab switcher style\" and Choose your favorite option: eg (icon only, icon and window preview etc)\n\nNOTE: by default the option is in \"icons and thumbnails\". So you can choose \"icons only\".\n\n", "Q: Which Ubuntu version should I install in a Macbook mid 2009, is going up to the latest version okay? I have a Macbook mid 2009 and I wish to install Ubuntu in it, just want to make sure which version is good to go in it.\n\nA: I would reccommend 12.04 (due to increased stability and support), unless you can cope with occasional breakage - then you might consider 13.04 which has been running well for me.\nFrom a hardware perspective, either should work. Burn a DVD or use a USB stick to test it in live mode before committing to the install.\n\nA: Firstly you have made the right choice in switching.  I am running the latest 13.10 on a 2009 mac 5,5. Everything is working except the nvidia drivers don't play nice with my backlight control, so instead I am using the xbacklight app.\nInstalling on a mac can sometimes be a headache, so you may need to find workarounds for various features (like I have mentioned above). Make sure you back up your important data beforehand in case anything goes wrong.\nGood luck!\n", "Q: Xorg/Compiz is using massive amounts of CPU. What to do? I am using Ubuntu 12.04.\nI've been trying to figure out what is causing my Xorg and Compiz to frequently come close to maxing out my CPU usage for weeks now. Essentially, during normal use, both processes will fluctuate between using next to no CPU to all of my CPU. \nI did a little research and it might be a memory leak, but I'm not entirely sure.

Though it wasn't using nearly as much of my CPU, just enough to annoy me from time to time.\n\nsudo apt-get install compizconfig-settings-manager\n\nAfter installation, press the Super/Windows key, and begin to type \"Compiz\", after which you can select the tool. (There is a warning upon opening the application, stating to be wary of changes made.) Click \"Ok\" and click on \"OpenGL\" (The actual words)\nUncheck \"Sync to VBlank\", and depending on your system, change the \"Texture Filter\" accordingly. (I personally have mine set to \"Fast\" and have not experienced any issues.)\nAfterwards I exited the application, and restarted my computer without any further problems.\n", "Q: Is the nginx charm stable for production? I'll like to use the nginx charm in production and will like to know if it's stable and ready enough for production.\nYes, I'm talking about specific juju charm for Nginx. I'm talking about this:\nhttp://manage.jujucharms.com/~imbrandon/precise/nginx\n\nA: No, the nginx charm is not considered production ready yet. An easy way to tell is by looking at the namespace:\nIt's in lp:~imbrandon/charms/precise/nginx/trunk.\nThat means a person has charmed it, but it hasn't met the guidelines that we expect in the charm store (yet). A production charm would be in ~lp:charms/precise/nginx/trunk or something like that. \nOptions here would be to:\n\n\n*\n\n*Review the charm yourself and determine if it's production ready, then either fix it to push it into the official store or maintain your own branch. \n\n\nA: Quoting the nginx main site:\n\nNginx is known for its high performance, stability, rich feature set, simple configuration, and low resource consumption.\nNginx powers several high-visibility sites, such as Netflix, Hulu, Pinterest, CloudFlare, Airbnb, WordPress.com, GitHub, SoundCloud, Zynga, Eventbrite, Zappos, Media Temple, Heroku, RightScale, Engine Yard and NetDNA.\n\nI know at least 4 of those sites, and I can vouch they work fantastically well from the user side. Also, the bug tracker only has 9 high priority bugs, 5 of them being defects (or in the argot, proper bugs) and Ubuntu specific bugs only 9 bugs, only one of them is of security concern, none about stability.\nWith all this information, I could say, that nginx is as stable as it could be and usable in production sites.\nBut if you are talking about a specific Juju charm, you should check the \"Quality\" tab. It provides more information.\n", "Q: Awful sound quality in Razer Megalodon I have a Razer Megalodon USB Headset that is producing extremely crackly sound in Ubuntu 13.04.\nI've generated an alsainfo file to try to find out what the problem is, and it seems it's only recognizing one \"PCM\" channel. This is shown in alsamixer as well.\nThe alsainfo.txt file with most of the info I can get is here:\nhttps://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/48007253/alsa-info.txt.\nThe info given by lsusb -v is provided here (it gets important at line 990):\nhttps://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/48007253/lsusb.txt\nThe output of for i in $(find /proc/asound/); do echo $i:; cat $i; echo; done, for those who are curious, is provided here: https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/48007253/asound.txt\nThe output of pacmd list is provided here:\nhttps://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/48007253/pacmdlist.txt\nI've confirmed the problem is not apparent in Windows 8.1, and it works with Plug-and-play functionality.\nIf I mess with the channel settings in the Ubuntu Sound Settings menu, I can occasionally get it working, but I can't get it to stay through reboots (or reconfiguring the sound menu again), and it definitely doesn't have the 7.1 surround sound.\nWhether I use aplay or mplayer to test known good sound files, it doesn't produce discernible sound. Selecting any of the speakers in the Ubuntu Sound Settings menu does not produce any output. One thing to note is that the sound is not pure static. If I listen carefully, I can pick out occasional discernible syllables while running mplayer Still\\ Alive.mp3.\nHopefully someone with some usb-audio/ALSA/Pulseaudio knowledge can help here.\n(as a side note, it turns out it's a bad idea to install oss4 on an Ubuntu system. Fortunately, I've got my sound back up and running again, now. It still didn't fix anything with the headset.)\n\nA: It looks like your headset has 7.1 channels.\nAre you sure your laptop's sound card supports this many channels?\nMake sure you have \ndefault-sample-channels = 8\n\nin \n/etc/pulse/daemon.conf\n\nFor more advanced configurations check ALSA wiki\n\nA: According to Razer:\nEnsure that you are using the latest firmware for your Megalodon.\nAlso try reseting the Razer Megalodon.  To reset the Razer Megalodon to factory default settings, press and hold the Channel Selector for 10 seconds while the Razer Megalodon is connected to a computer that is powered on.    \nNOTE:  ALL CONFIGURATION SETTINGS WILL BE LOST WHEN YOU RESET THE RAZER MEGALODON\nAlso, acoording to Dell, there have been complaints about the Audio with the machine that you have.  As well as an urgent BIOS update\n", "Q: Live USB ubuntu can only boot when deleting casper file I installed the ubuntu 12.04 into my flash drive to create a bootable usb stick. The first time boot is smooth with no issue. But after played around with it and rebooted it, the ubuntu could not get start.\nI tried both pendrivelinux and universal-usb-installer to create the bootable usb. They both have the same issue, but giving two different errors. The previous one stops with \"kernel.thread helper\" error. The later one ends up with a shell command environment, but can't boot ubuntu.\nMy flash drive is 4 GB, and I reserved 2GB room for the persistence. So I can see a 2GB casper file in the flash drive. After I delete this file, I can boot the ubuntu system again.\nSo I guess it might be some issue with loading the persistent data. \nAny thought about how to fix this issue?\nThank you very much!\n\nA: I had bad luck with the casper-rw  file too. For some reason I couldn't either boot my ubuntu usb with persistent changes nor mount it from within an installed ubuntu OS. It's something weird about my laptop hp 420 I guess, because my casper-rw file worked fine in other computers. \nAnyway if you still want to boot it without persistent chances AND without deleting the casper-rw file, you can do that by deleting the \"--quiet\", \"--splash\" and \"--persistent\" arguments from the kernel parameters entry at the very start of the booting of ubuntu. I don't know to make those visible from USB isos created with other programs, but with unetbootin you do this by pressing tab after selecting your boot option.\nCheers.\n", "Q: Thunderbird won't start Restarted my computer, and noticed that Thunderbird which is set to auto-start did not start.

Now I encountered a very serious issue that for some reasons I need to update the configuration file like httpd.conf, hosts.deny and others and in order to make these changes to take effect, every time I rebooted the Ubutn server machine which is totally not allowed and produces serious impacts. I know Ubuntu has many kinds of configuation files, including ones from system itself, or user's applications, etc, so the questions I'm intending to ask are:\n1, can anybody summarize a list of types of configuation files in Ubuntu?\n2, what's the convenient way for making these changes to take effect without rebooting the machine?\nThanks in advance.\n\nA: It depends of the service, but in most cases involves sudo service <service name> reload:\nsudo service apache2 reload\nsudo service squid3 reload\nsudo service sshd reload\n\nIn the case that the operation returns:\n$ sudo service motd reload\nError: argument 'reload' not supported\n\nYou can try restart.\nsudo service motd restart\n\nIf that don't work too, then a combination of stop and start:\nsudo service motd stop\nsudo service motd start\n\n\nA: Some changes take effect immediately, because the /etc file is consulted each time it is needed. For example, if you update /etc/hosts (or in the example you give, /etc/hosts.deny), it is effective immediately because next time the contents are needed the file is re-read.\nIf you know the service related to the config file, then reload or restart the service - see Braiam's comprehensive answer.\nIf you don't know which service the file relates do, then perhaps you should not be editing it? :-)\nOne option is to look at the list of available services and take a guess. The service command invoked init.d scripts, so\n$ ls /etc/init.d\n\nwill give you the list of services.\nAnother option is to find which package the config file belongs to. Ask dpkg:\n# dpkg -S /etc/ntp.conf\nntp: /etc/ntp.conf\n\nThis tells me that /etc/ntp.conf belongs to the ntp package - and sure enough there is a ntp service that can be reloaded or restarted.\n", "Q: ButtonMapping - Positional parameters In an X configuration file mouse buttons can be mapped using a ButtonMapping option:\nSection \"InputClass\"\n    # ...\n    Option \"ButtonMapping\" \"1 9 3 4 5 6 7 8 2\"\n    # ...\nEndSection\n\nChanging the order of the numbers changes the behaviour of the mouse buttons. Yet I cannot find any documentation that describes how the behaviour is assigned. What little documentation there is, I helped write.\nFor example, if the button mapping was written thus:\n    Option \"ButtonMapping\" \"a b c d e f g h i\"\n\nWe would document these positions as:\n\n\n*\n\n*a - Left click\n\n*b - Middle\n\n*c - Right click\n\n*d - Scroll forward\n\n*e - Scroll backward\n\n*f - Forward\n\n*g - Backward\n\n*h - Horizontal scroll\n\n*i - Vertical scroll\n\n\nMy question then: what do the positional values of a through i actually represent and how are they mapped to mouse buttons?\nUpdate\nRunning xmodmap -pp shows:\n$ xmodmap -pp\nThere are 10 pointer buttons defined.\n\n    Physical        Button\n     Button          Code\n        1              1\n        2              2\n        3              3\n        4              4\n        5              5\n        6              6\n        7              7\n        8              8\n        9              9\n       10             10\n\nThis is not useful as it contains no information a human can use about the physical attributes of the mouse (i.e., showing two columns of numbers is useless without button names, such as \"left button\"). So while technically this might answer the question of \"how are they mapped\", the question remains unanswered in any practical sense.\n\nA: I think you should look at it this way:\n                        1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9  <--position-- physical keys\nOption \"ButtonMapping\" \"1 9 3 4 5 6 7 8 2\" <--function-- logical keys\n\n\n\n*\n\n*The position that indicates the key id as reported by mouse (through driver). So it's up to the manufacturer how to order them, however most stick to common order.\nMouses still using the old protocols like PS2, it doesn't have a way store or tell info about available buttons and their functions. So X server can't tell you the id of each physical button, only by trying them using a tool like xev that shows the X events:\nxev -event mouse\n\nOr evtest that shows the raw events:\nsudo evtest\n\n\n*The logical key are the ones actually mapped some where else for extra functions. At this level, X looks at them as: button1, button2, button3, button4,...,button24 and it does not know their function.\nOfficial reference examples:\n  7.  Configuration Examples\n\n  This section shows some example InputDevice section for popular mice.\n  All the examples assume that the mouse is connected to the PS/2 mouse\n  port, and the OS supports the PS/2 mouse initialization.  It is also\n  assumed that /dev/mouse is a link to the PS/2 mouse port.\n\n  Logitech MouseMan+ has 4 buttons and a wheel. The following example\n  makes the wheel movement available as the button 5 and 6.\n\n  Section \"InputDevice\"\n          Identifier      \"MouseMan+\"\n          Driver          \"mouse\"\n          Option          \"Device\"    \"/dev/mouse\"\n          Option          \"Protocol\"  \"MouseManPlusPS/2\"\n          Option          \"Buttons\"   \"6\"\n          Option          \"ZAxisMapping\"      \"5 6\"\n  EndSection\n\n  You can change button number assignment using the xmodmap command\n  AFTER you start the X server with the above configuration.  You may\n  not like to use the wheel as the button 2 and rather want the side\n  button (button 4) act like the button 2. You may also want to map the\n  wheel movement to the button 4 and 5.  This can be done by the\n  following command:\n\n          xmodmap -e \"pointer = 1 6 3 2 4 5\"\n\n  After this command is run, the correspondence between the buttons and\n  button numbers will be as shown in the following table.\n\n  Physical Buttons        Reported as:\n  ------------------------------------\n  1 Left Button             Button 1\n  2 Wheel Button            Button 6\n  3 Right Button            Button 3\n  4 Side Button             Button 2\n  5 Wheel Negative Move     Button 4\n  6 Wheel Positive Move     Button 5\n\n\n  Starting in the Xorg 6.9 release, you can also achieve this in your\n  configuration file by adding this to the \"InputDevice\" section in\n  xorg.conf:\n\n          Option \"ButtonMapping\" \"1 6 3 2 4 5\"\n\n  For the MS IntelliMouse Explorer which as a wheel and 5 buttons, you\n  may have the following InputDevice section.\n\n  Section \"InputDevice\"\n          Identifier      \"IntelliMouse Explorer\"\n          Driver          \"mouse\"\n          Option          \"Device\"    \"/dev/mouse\"\n          Option          \"Protocol\"  \"ExplorerPS/2\"\n          Option          \"Buttons\"   \"7\"\n          Option          \"ZAxisMapping\"      \"6 7\"\n  EndSection\n\n  The IntelliMouse Explorer has 5 buttons, thus, you should give \"7\" to\n  the Buttons option if you want to map the wheel movement to buttons (6\n  and 7).

I installed Ubuntu 12.04.2 via the windows installer and I only allocated 18GB for its partition. I still want to use Ubuntu but I want it on a larger partition so I would like to either delete the partition it's currently using and reinstall Ubuntu with a larger partition (around 100GB or so). OR if there's a way I can actually expand the partition it's on that would be great since I wouldn't have to start all over again.\n\nA: There are two different techniques for resizing the Ubuntu partition in Wubi:\n\n\n*\n\n*Resize and Duplicate Wubi Disk - This is not strictly a resize, but rather a duplication to a new virtual disk. This has the benefit in that it doesn't modify your current root.disk, and also leaves a backup. On the downside, if you want to go from a 7GB Wubi install to a 10GB Wubi install, you need a full 10GB of free space, as well as enough free space for Windows to operate (so may not be ideal if you are low on space). This technique must be run from within the booted Wubi install.1 \n\n*In-place Resize of Wubi virtual disk This method is a true resize of the virtual disk (root.disk), and must be performed from an Ubuntu live CD. This is very fast, and can also make better use of the available space on the host partition than the alternate method, which duplicates the virtual disk.2 \nThe step-by-step illustrated instructions for resizing the Ubuntu Wubi partition using each of these two techniques are available at the two Ubuntu Documentation wikis which I have referenced in the following two footnotes.\n1Source: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/ResizeandDuplicateWubiDisk\n2Source: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/ResizeWubiDisk\n\nA: Yes you can do that.

With Mplayer, VLC and Totem I tried to access the files on several DVDs, but I had no luck. \nIn Synaptic I found Dvdisaster and tried it. And Dvdisaster was the only program that detected something on the two DVDs I tried. It gave the name/title and was scanning, but that took too long and burned video play in standalone dvdplayer and windows. Does Dvdisaster use special libraries?\nI tried opening a DVD from the terminal: \njoost@joost-HP-Compaq-nc6320:~$ mplayer dvd://\nMPlayer2 UNKNOWN (C) 2000-2012 MPlayer Team\nmplayer: could not connect to socket\nmplayer: No such file or directory\nFailed to open LIRC support.

Those two factors will result in either a good quality DVD or a bad one which lasts a few months then refuses to read properly...  Also the program you use and it's settings can result in the DVD itself reading ok on one machine and not on another...\nPs. Do you have the SMP kernels install so it will use your full 4gb memory ?\n\nA: Maybe this is just a typo error in your question, but I found an error in the command you used for enabling playing encrypted DVDs. When you tried to run the install-css.sh installation script you opened the terminal and ran:\nsudo /usr/share/doc/libdvdread4/./install-css.sh  \n\nThis is incorrect. It should be:\nsudo chmod +x '/usr/share/doc/libdvdread4/install-css.sh'\nsudo /usr/share/doc/libdvdread4/install-css.sh  \n\nFor more detailed information on the previously mentioned command visit the Ubuntu Documentation Restricted Formats/Playing DVDs wiki and read the section of the wiki titled Installing libdvdcss.\nWith regard to your comment about to the DVDs not playing, even though the file structure of the DVD is detected, this could be a consequence of the laser in the DVD drive wearing out, so that you're not getting a strong enough signal to play a burned DVD, only a commercial one. CD and DVD drives do wear out in the course of time, but they are simple and inexpensive to replace. If you tried attaching an external USB DVD drive or swapping the DVD drive that you have, the DVDs might play just fine.\n", "Q: Resume a process via a PID number I wanted a daemon to start on boot so I added a line to /etc/rc.local that ended in \"&\" \nI did that so it would run in the background.\nThe daemon is loaded and working fine but when the daemon is running you can press keys that do other important things.\nWhen I am finally logged in I wanted to resume process or send it a terminal (tty2) so I can do a couple of things.\nI'm new to linux and not sure how to do this.\nI do a ps -aux |grep uox to work out which PID it is. But not sure how to resume.\n\nA: You can resume a process via a PID number from any shell by using the kill command. \nkill -CONT <pid> \n\nDon't forget the -CONT part or you will kill your process.\nP.S. David Purdue is correct that fg and bg only work with processes on the same process tree. His solution seems to be a better fit your needs.\nHowever because the title is \"Resume a process via a PID number\" I figured that others who do need this might want to find it.\n\nA: jobs will only list the jobs that are associated with the shell that the jobs command is run in, and similarly fg and bg only work with processes on the same process tree as the current shell. In the context of this question, the job you want to attach to was started with /etc/rc.local, so that shell is not the current one you are in.\nYou could start the process from /etc/rc.local with the screen command (https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Screen) - this will start it up attached to a pseudo terminal, then you can later use screen again to attach to that terminal and type characters at the running program.\nInstall screen using apt-get, then type man screen to see all the options. I'm not sure exactly what you should put in rc.local and don't have time right now to experiment, but may update this answer later.\n\nA: Borrowed from Vijay\nUse the jobs command to find the list of background processes that are started by you.\nfor eg: there is script which simply sleeps for 10 secs in 5 iterations.I ran it 4 times in the background.\n>jobs\n[1]  + Running                       ./temp.sh\n[2]  - Running                       ./temp.sh\n[3]    Running                       ./temp.sh\n[4]    Running                       ./temp.sh\n\nfg is the command to bring it back to the foreground as shown below.\n>fg 1\n[CTRL -c]\n\nas seen above i have ended the process and it no longer exists.\nnow if i again run jobs\n>jobs\n[2]  + Running                       ./temp.sh\n[3]    Running                       ./temp.sh\n[4]  - Running                       ./temp.sh\n>\n\nAlso you can check here for more\n", "Q: Restore 'cd ..' functionality after following a symbolic link If I create a symbolic link in the terminal with a command like\nln -s /path/to/some/directory symbolicLink\nand then follow the link with \ncd symbolicLink\nthe terminal appears to think that the cwd is ~/symbolicLink/ even though it is actually showing ~/path/to/some/directory/ (assuming that the link was made in ~, of course). What this means is that if I then type cd .. I am taken back to ~, because the terminal 'thinks' this is the parent of the cwd. \nWhat would I need to change such that cd .. would instead take me to ~/path/to/some/, i.e. the real parent of ~/path/to/some/directory/?\n\nA: There's a subtle caveat in the cd -P behaviour (posted as answer because of the length):\n$ dir1=$(mktemp --directory)\n$ dir2=$(mktemp --directory)\n$ ln -s -- \"$dir1\" /tmp/start\n$ ln -s -- \"$dir2\" \"$dir1\"\n$ cd \"/tmp/start/\"*\n$ cd -P ..\n\nWhat should pwd print now?

That is, if foo is deleted from source, then rename foo in backups with the date suffix.\nI have tried to achieve this but so far no success. Any ideas?\n\nA: Adding the --backup-dir option should do what you're looking for:\n\n--backup-dir=DIR\n      In combination with the --backup option, this tells rsync to store all backups in the specified directory on the receiving side. This can be used for incremental backups. You can additionally specify a backup suffix using the --suffix option (otherwise the files backed up in the specified directory will keep their original filenames). \n\ne.g.\nrsync -ab --backup-dir=versions --suffix=\".\"$(date +\"%Y%m%d%H%M\") --delete /source/folder/ /destination/folder\n\nThis would create backups of your files at /destination/versions\nSource: https://linux.die.net/man/1/rsync\n\nA: Add the --delete option to your rsync command.  --delete tells rsync that when it sees a file that is in the destination but not the source, it should delete it from the destination - except since you are also using --backup, instead of deleting the file it will rename and/or move it, depending on whether you've specified a --suffix and/or --backup-dir.  \nIn your case since you have specified a suffix that changes from run to run, you'll need to add a protect filter rule so that files previously backed up with a suffix don't get get renamed again: \n--filter='P *.[0-9][0-9][0-9][0-9][0-9][0-9][0-9][0-9][0-9][0-9][0-9][0-9]'\nThat filter pattern looks for filenames ending in a dot and then 12 digits, which is the format of your date suffix.  That suffix is a bit ambiguous, so I'd suggest using some other format with some special character(s) or a unique string in the suffix, so that ordinary files won't be mistaken for backup files.\n\nA: For incremental rsync backup used rsnapshot tool.\nSample rsnapshot.conf\nsnapshot_root   /backup\n\ncmd_cp          /bin/cp\n\ncmd_rm          /bin/rm\n\ncmd_rsync       /usr/bin/rsync\n\ncmd_ssh /usr/bin/ssh\n\ncmd_logger      /usr/bin/logger\n\ncmd_du          /usr/bin/du\n\ncmd_rsnapshot_diff      /usr/bin/rsnapshot-diff\n\nretain          daily   7\nretain          weekly  4\n\nverbose         2\n\nloglevel        3\n\nlogfile /var/log/rsnapshot.log\n\nlockfile        /var/run/rsnapshot.pid\n\nbackup  root@localhost:/etc/                   localhost/\nbackup  root@localhost:/home                   localhost/\nbackup  root@localhost:/var/www/               localhost/\n\nSet Cronjobs For auto backup:\n# m     h   dom mon dow command\n#Run Rsnapshot At 02:00 Everyday\n00      02      *       *       *       /usr/bin/rsnapshot daily\n#Run Rsnapshot At 06:00 Every Sunday \n00      06      *       *       0       /usr/bin/rsnapshot weekly\n\n", "Q: Installing postgres removes rabbitmq and vice versa.

Logrotate 3.8 changed it's config files and postgresql-9.2 will insist that you don't have a bad logrotate version relative to your postgresql version. One resolution for this is to just remove logrotate when you install postgresql-9.2.\nA possible workaround would be to install precise's logrotate (which is pre-3.8). This should make both postgresql-9.2 and rabbitmq happy.\nWe are thinking about a workaround for apt.postgresql.org, but so far no one came up with a solution that doesn't involve too much magic. (We are not going to support raring on apt.postgresql.org as a separate distribution because it isn't an LTS release.)\nHTH\n", "Q: Facebook chat not working with empathy in Ubuntu 12.04 I am using Ubuntu 12.04, and been trying to connect to facebook chat using Empathy. But the connection is not getting successful, and it is showing \"Disconnected - network error\".\nThe parameters I entered is the following:\nProtocol:Jabber\nJabber ID:  someone.someone@chat.facebook.com (The facebook username being www.facebook.com/someone.someone)\nJabber Password: something (My facebook password)\nEncryption required: TLS/SSL \nServer: chat.facebook.com \nPort: 5222\nHow to resolve the issue? Please Help.\n\nA: For the current period (now is August 2013), this seems to be a Facebook new feature compatibility problem. The following links below shows that not only Empathy suffers this \"Network Error\", but also all (most, probably) IM clients. \nIt seems that FB has recently changed its authentication scheme. I'm not sure if someone is working out there to address this change so that Empathy will soon be compatible with FB's X-FACEBOOK-PLATFORM SASL authentication mechanism.\nThe best thing to probably do now (if we are not developers) is to sit down, relax, and wait until we can thank those hard-working programmers in fixing this.

I used to connect to WiFi networks and it was going well, but now every time I try to connect I connect OK, but I kill the network connections on my other machine! How did this happen? I have already tried the following solution. \nCan anyone help? \nthe solution was to open up the file /etc/modprobe.d/blacklist.conf and add\nblacklist bcm43xxblacklist b43\nblacklist b43legacy\nblacklist bcma\nblacklist ndiswrapper\nblacklist wl\n\nNext, open up the file /etc/modules and add the following at the end of the file:\nbrcmsmac\n\nAlternatively, you can type sudo sh -c \"echo 'brcmsmac' >> /etc/modules\" in a terminal to do this all at once.\nFinally reboot the machine.\nNow, what caused this bug?\n\nA: There are some Broadcom wireless cards for which there are two drivers. As you might expect, one usually works well and the other not well at all. The 'Additional Drivers' utility happily offers and installs the wrong driver in a few cases, as you've seen.\nI suggest you also run:\nsudo apt-get remove --purge bcmwl-kernel-source\n\nYou should also remove bcma from the blacklist.conf file. One of the dependencies of brcmsmac is bcma; you need both. \n", "Q: Somehow, I've stoped OpenGL working Somehow, I can no longer run anything that uses OpenGL.

When you update the driver module it isn't automatically reloaded into the kernel. To do that you would need to shut down X, rmmod and modprobe for it (and in my experience that doesn't even work for the deb-installed Nvidia driver, only the manual install.\nThe fix is really simple though. Restart the computer.\nYour computer should load the new copy of the Nvidia module on boot and then everything 3D should just work™ again.\n\nAs this is a Bumblebee-using computer, it might be enough to close anything using 3D then run:\nsudo rmmod nvidia\nsudo modprobe nvidia\n\nBut as I say, this doesn't work on normal computers with the deb installer for the driver. Not sure why but it's worth a shot. Otherwise: reboot.\n\nThis might actually be far more TBP-related than I originally thought. Here is a support thread suggesting that something needs renaming.\nI think the suggestion involves editing /etc/bumblebee/bumblebee.conf so that\nKernelDriver=nvidia-current and then running sudo restart bumblebeed to restart bumblebee.\n\nA: Perform a \n\nsudo apt-get install libgl1-mesa-dri \n\nand it should work again.\n\nA: 1.

You'll have to install the Catalyst Legacy driver. However, the Catalyst Legacy driver only supports kernel version 3.4 and xorg version 1.12.4, and Lubuntu 13.04 ships with kernel version 3.8 and xorg version 1.13\nTo install the Catalyst legacy driver, you'll have to downgrade xorg to version 1.12 and patch the driver.\nLuckily, this can be done in a few simple steps, by adding a ppa that contains a patched version of the Catalyst Legacy driver.\nTo do this, open a terminal window (press ALT+F2 and type xterm or your favorite terminal emulator)\nEnter the following commands:\nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:makson96/fglrx\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get upgrade\nsudo apt-get install fglrx-legacy\n\nThis way, you'll add Tomasz Makarewicz's ppa that contains the patched driver. It will also automatically downgrade your xorg version to 1.12.\nOnce the install finishes, reboot your machine and you should be using the Catalyst Legacy driver. You can then start the AMD Catalyst Control Center by opening your terminal emulator and running sudo amdcccle\n", "Q: How can I access Ubuntu from Windows 8?

Like the Server software on which it is based, Client Hyper-V only runs on 64-bit PCs that are running the 64-bit version of Windows 8 Pro (or Enterprise).*\nChipset requirements.

Fortunately, this is a feature of all current generation (“Sandy Bridge” on Intel) microprocessors. But it means that your older Core 2 Duo-based PCs may not work.\nMemory. Your PC must be configured with at least 4 GB of RAM. Of course, more is always better with virtualization, so if your needs are high-end, you’ll want more RAM than that.\nSource: Windows 8 Feature Focus: Client Hyper-V\nGo to \"Turn Windows features on or off\" and check if you can enable Hyper-V.\nYou you don't have the required hardware use VirualBox or Vmware instead. \n\nA: So you've got Ubuntu and Windows in dual boot and you want to access run Ubuntu from inside Windows too? Do you still want dual boot?\nThe simplest way would be to just have a separate install of Ubuntu inside a VM (virtual machine) in Windows, using something like VirtualBox.\nIf you want access to the same install from within Windows, that should be possible too - but it's a lot less tested. VirtualBox can give a VM access to a partition and through that you should be able to boot. The VBox website says this can be risky so make sure any data in the Ubuntu partition is backed up somewhere.\nIf you don't need to be able to dual-boot, I'd be tempted to ditch the bare-metal Ubuntu install and just set up a standard VM.\n", "Q: No Sound after playing around with pulseaudio I was trying to be able to monitor my microphone input and I ran into this question.

Hi I went to download OpenSUSE from Distrowatch and selected the bit torrent download.\nThe download distro appeared in \"My Downloads\" within seconds. It usually take 3 hours for a distro to download on my system. However about an hour later I could not get it to burn to DVD disk.\nThere also appears to be two parts to it which I have not experienced before.  Previously all my d/l had only one file.\nI am also worried about my security due to the p2p aspect, and I don't like not being able to see the download in progress.\nIs there anyway I can remove this application from Ubuntu? If not, how safe is it to leave it installed? Can I stop it taking over so that I can download distros as I used to?\n\nA: Transmission is the Bittorrent client installed by default. You can remove this if you wish and the following command should do the job:\nsudo apt-get remove transmission-common\n\nHowever...\n\n\n*\n\n*As Luis points out in the comments, it sounds like you never actually started the download. You downloaded a torrent file (which needs to be loaded into a torrent client - like Transmission). A torrent is just a description of stuff to download. That's why the download was so fast and wouldn't burn to DVD.\n\n*When you start a torrent properly it does let you know the progress. There should be a Transmission icon sitting in your tray (looks like a gearstick in an automatic car) and if not, just load Transmission.\n\n*There are no \"security\" issues with P2P. If you mean legal issues, that only applies if you're downloading things you have no license for. Bittorrent is a safe way of transporting files. Having it installed is not against the law. Using it illegally is.\n\n*Bittorrent also performs CRC checks on the sections of the file you're transferring. It's therefore more likely you'll see errors in standard downloads than in torrent downloads.\n\n*It also isn't taking over. It can't. If you're downloading a .torrent file, (respectfully) that's your fault. If you want a non-torrent version of something, download that instead.\n\n\nDistributions use (and prefer) Bittorrent because of these reasons. It's also less bandwidth intensive for them to manage (because you'll download it from other people with copies too). It's also generally pretty fast because the download is split over multiple hosts.

I am very new to all of this and i would just like my wifi to work. would installing a driver for it help? Do i have to get a different adapter?\n\nA: Since you already know exactly what Wifi you have, this should be easy.\nUbuntu has a software tool that allows it to use a Windows driver for your Wifi card.\nIt's called Ndiswrapper. If you have no access to internet you can use the install media that you installed with to install Ndiswrapper (It's on the disk image).\nUse this Ubuntu help page as a reference.\n1. Download the Wifi driver for the card from HP. You already linked the site so this should be easy enough. Find a way to get it to the Ubuntu computer. Usb key, burning to a cd, whatever.\n2.

In my laptop, I've also got a 500Gb SATA HDD. I realize that in order for this to work I need to put my /home directory on the 500Gb HDD. \nI've tried installing it by creating a ext4 partition on the SSD and a 8Gb swap partition on my HDD. This resulted in an error saying something similar to Cannot install bootloader, please select an other location for the bootloader. \nNow before I waste any more time trying to get it to work I'm going to ask a bunch of questions:\n\n\n*\n\n*Where should I put the swap partition?\n\n*How big should I make the swap partition? (I've got 12Gb RAM)\n\n*My 500Gb HDD is currently in Raid mode. Should I change that (to AHCI or IDE)?\n\n*Where should I put the bootloader if the error message occurs again?\n\n*How do I make the home directory point to the HDD instead of the SSD?\n\n*Can I configure Ubuntu to install software/packages on the HDD instead of the SSD?\n\n\nA: Swap should be on hard drive. With 12GB of RAM you may never use swap. The only time you might use swap would be if you hibernate, but if booting from SSD hibernation does not save much if anything. I still suggest a little swap just to have some or maybe 2GB. Others have had no swap with that much RAM and said it works.\nYou need to change to AHCI and removed RAID meta-data on drives. That is probably why grub will not install as it sees the RAID and wants to install to RAID. \nsudo dmraid -E -r /dev/sda\nsudo dmraid -E -r /dev/sdb\n\nIs system UEFI or BIOS? That makes a difference on where to install grub. If BIOS you install grub to the MBR of either drive, but preferred to install to SSD. If UEFI you install to efi partition.\nIf you use manual install and have already created partitions with gparted, you just need to select partition for / (root), choose format and what format (ext4 usually), likewise for /home but if /home already exists with data you DO NOT format. If swap already exists it will find it automatically.\nI have a 28GB /(root) partition and use about 9GB including /home which has .wine with Picasa. I have lots of programs installed. I think you can installs games to /home so those would be on HDD. You can split system folders and add to HDD like you do with /home but that should not be required.\nAll system folders in / can be partitions. Usually only done for servers with specific requirements.\nExplanation of file structure\nhttp://www.tuxfiles.org/linuxhelp/linuxdir.html\nhttp://www.pathname.com/fhs/pub/fhs-2.3.html\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Filesystem_Hierarchy_Standard\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linux_Standard_Base\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix_directory_structure\n", "Q: Invisible software updates list in Software Updater Today I received an update notification for three updates but update manager doesn't say what updates are they.\n\nDoes anyone have a clue what this is about?

You may have set up private only network.\n\nYou can SSH to it because it is via NAT port forwarding, in other words, you are connecting to 127.0.0.1 port 2222 (mapping to guest 22).\nIn theory, to be able to ping the guest 10.0.2.15/24 in 10.0.2.0/24 network, the host MUST have a route to the network.\nIn your case, this is a VirtualBox VM hiding behind the virtual NAT router, and what you see (host cannot ping the virtual machine) that's how NAT works. The host won't be able to reach the host behind NAT unless port forwarding rules for (TCP/UDP) are configured. Unfortunately ping replies on ICMP, no way. I am not sure if you can figure out a route that doesn't break your existing networking.\nSo to sum up, you would like to ping the guest VM from host, switch to bridged networking or enable a secondary network adapter as bridged so that it will be reachable from host (as the VM will have a IP address in the same subnet).\n", "Q: Why cannot xdg-desktop-menu-dummy.menu be backed up?

But to me it's a bit confusing - I mean, it should be possible to dump any hardware's firmware, right?\n\nA: The sysfs rom file allows you to read the PCI ROM contents, but apparently the device does not expose that information. It is not available or not implemented by the device.\nAbout why ethtool -e eth0 fails, the current r8169 driver (up to and including 3.19-rc3) does not implement a method to read from the EEPROM. If your Realtek network device has an Atmel 93C46 or 93C56 EEPROM, then you can add this r8169 functionality with this patch (for Linux 3.11) (same patch, rebased for 3.17, works for 3.19 too).\nFor those whose device is \"bricked\" (symptoms: garbage MAC address such as bb:6f:ff:ff:ff:ff, vendor/device ID reported as 10ec:8129), you could try to follow the instructions in that message. I have tried it in the past and from time to time I have to repeat it when the power is fully removed from the machine. Unfortunately, the instructions are not 100% reliable and every time I have to try much more tricks in order to get it to work.

Just set persistence to the maximum of 4gb. But if you want more storage space, select no persistence. Then you can use a partitioning tool to create a casper partition to use the full 8gb of your flash drive. Here is a good tutorial.\nGood luck\n\nA: Like others have said, it may be that you just set your live usb into persistence mode when you made it. Some usb creators make it hard to see graphically whether or not persistence mode is enabled. \nI prefer Linux Live USB creator as far as looks and ease of use goes, it's also really easy to make sure you are/are not in persistence mode when making your live USB. However, UNetBootin is definitely better when it comes to Linux Distro compatibility. I don't know which USB creator you're using, but if your'e making a 13.04 usb I'd recommend Linux Live USB creator. \nLinux Live:\nhttp://www.linuxliveusb.com/\nUNetBootin:\nhttp://unetbootin.sourceforge.net/\nBe sure when you make your Live usb that you always format it, both of these creators have the option to do that during the process. That should also guarantee that you have the extra free space that you're missing. \nI hope this helps, good luck!\n", "Q: \"phablet-flash: error: too few arguments\" when installing Ubuntu Touch I am using galaxy nexus yakjuux variant, I have converted it to yakju now since the basic requirements given for installing ubuntu touch was to have yakju or takju.

I am migrating my home server from windows based to ubuntu based server. I am happy and satisfied with my Windows XP based file server and have been using it for about 6 years now. I am decommissioning the Windows XP server and wish to use my new linux server based on Ubuntu 12.04 LTS Desktop edition. I plan of using the server edition when I'll be satisfied with the desktop edition. But right now, I am having some problem with FILE PERMISSION in my new Ubuntu server.\nIn my Windows XP, I've shared a 4TB RAID0 array and the whole of it is shared within my workgroup. I have several users with different user permissions and I wanted this to be applied also in my Ubuntu server. But I am having some problem implementing it. Probably because of my lack of knowledge administering it.\nRight now, In my Ubuntu server, I created a 4TB RAID Array and the whole of it is shared. \nThe contents of the RAID array is chowned recursively to admin-one:users.\nThe contents of the RAID array is chmoded recursively to 750.\nIn the server I have created the user-one and user-twoaccount that belongs to users group.\nIn the shared RAID array, I have a folder called restricted.\nEverything is setup well and runs fine with the client machine.\nThe problem now is, I have no idea on how shall I restrict user-one from accessing the restricted folder, since user-one belongs to users group that has read and execute permission for the whole contents of the RAID array and from where the restricted folder is located too. I can easily do this in windows, but not in Ubuntu.\nTo summarize the user's permissions:\nadmin-one - has read write execute permission to the whole shared partition.\nuser-one - has read and execute permission to the whole shared partition.\nuser-two - has read and execute permission to the whole shared partition.\nAnd what I want to accomplish is:\nuser-one - has read and execute permission to the whole shared partition but shall have no access to the restricted folder.\nuser-two - has read and execute permission to the whole shared partition that includes the restricted folder, BUT shall have not write permission to the folder.\nSo, the general question is, how shall I set different permissions to different users?\n\nA: You can use ACLs (a page to read about it: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/FilePermissionsACLs).\nACLs work without any configuration needed at least in Ubuntu 13.04. I have no idea if they work in Ubuntu 12.04 straight away. If they don't, you could enable ACLs (search around how to do it) or ignore my answer.\n\n\n*\n\n*To restrict user-one from accessing the restricted folder, you could run the command:\nsudo setfacl -m u:user-one:- restricted\n\n\n*To give user-two only read/write permission to the folder:\nsudo setfacl -m u:user-two:rw restricted\n\n\n*To remove all ACLs from the folder:\nsudo setfacl -b restricted\n\n\n*To view the ACLs of the folder:\ngetfacl restricted\n\nAlso, when you use the command ls -l to view the standard permissions of the folder, you will see an additional '+' in the permissions.\nAgain, I don't know if ACLs are enabled by default in Ubuntu 12.04.\nIf these commands fail, then ACLs are not enabled.\n", "Q: Does Ubuntu support my video cards?

I tried downloading Google Chrome but that didn’t work. YouTube also doesn’t work on Firefox.\nHow can I fix this?\n\nA: You do not have flash installed. It does not come pre-installed in Ubuntu.

I had done something like:\nJAVA_8=/opt/jdk1.8.0_121\nJAVA_HOME=$JAVA_8\nGROOVY_HOME=/opt/groovy-2.3.9\nGRADLE_HOME=/opt/gradle-2.0\nIDEA_HOME=/opt/idea-IU-171.3780.107\n\nPATH=${PATH}:${GRADLE_HOME}/bin:${JAVA_HOME}/bin:${IDEA_HOME}/bin\n\nSo, once I got to a terminal (ctrl + alt + F1), and tried to, e.g., 'cat', I was getting:\nThe command could not be located because '/bin' is not included in the PATH environment variable.  echoing the PATH showed me that I had overwritten my PATH, so I had to manually set PATH:\nPATH=\"/usr/local/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/sbin:/usr/bin:/sbin:/bin:/usr/games\"\n\nThen I could use vim (or whatever) to manually edit my /etc/environment back into a good state.\n", "Q: Is there a tool similar to spotlight search in OS X for Ubuntu? (specifically Ubuntu 12.04) Is there any tool equivalent to spotlight search in OS X for Ubuntu 12.04?\nSomething where you just type a search string and files, folders or installed programs will appear in a list.\n\nA: Synapse is a GUI tool which does exactly what you expect from a graphical program. It is a place where you just type file name, folder name or installed program name and it will appear in the list as shown in the next screenshot: \n\nAfter installing you can configure your key bindings which you can use to invoke Synapse in order to write what you wish to find. It may require a certain amount of time in order to get the list of files and applications for the first use but it will improve as you use it.\nGood luck!\n", "Q: Ubuntu is slow and I don't know why I've been an XP user forever and I still am. Yesterday wanted to try Ubuntu I installed it and its very very slow on my computer. Here's my computer specs intel celeron(R) 2.40 GHz 1 gb of memory . Did I do something wrong because I heard Ubuntu is really fast. When I look in system monitor it says the the CPU is constantly at 100 %.  \nThanks \n\nA: It's because Ubuntu is using your CPU (which barely makes the cut) to handle GPU code for the Unity interface. Use Additional Drivers (jockey-gtk or Software Sources > Additional Drivers tab) to see if there are graphics drivers available for your system. If not, you may want to consider buying a better computer. Or, since those are very minimal specs for Ubuntu, you may want to try Lubuntu, Xubuntu, or even Kubuntu (which is also somewhat cumbersome), all official variants of Ubuntu, or even a whole different distro; there are plenty out there.\n\nA: Press Ctrl-Alt-T to open a terminal window, and run the command top to see what might be hitting your CPU so hard. Something is probably misbehaving and this is the first step to finding out what it might be.\n", "Q: CAD *.stp files on Ubuntu 13.04 32Bit I'm not able to open 3D CAD *.stp files on my Ubuntu, I tried to import them with Salome Meca however without effect ? What went wrong ?\n\nA: To open .stp files, try FreeCAD.\n\nFreeCAD is an Open Source CAx RAD based on OpenCasCade, Qt and Python.\n  It features some key concepts like macro recording, workbenches,\n  ability to run as a server and dynamically loadable application\n  extensions and it is designed to be platform independent.\nCurrently, FreeCAD can import and display CAD models in IGES, STEP,\n  and BRep formats and meshes in STL, BMS, AST and Wavefront OBJ\n  formats. Editing and modeling features are currently somewhat limited.\n\nFor more info check out their Website.\nTo install click FreeCAD \nSource:Ubuntu Apps\n", "Q: What is the absolute minimum that a linux system needs to boot? I think that I need a kernel image and a bootloader (grub). Is there anything else that a linux system needs to boot?\n\nA: There are many Linux distributions that have different minimum requirements and many \"Tiny\" linux distributions that require even less. Now to make this relevant to AskUbuntu, the minimum requirements for Ubuntu (including Xubuntu and Lubuntu) are here:\nhttps://help.ubuntu.com/community/Installation/SystemRequirements\nOtherwise if you're looking for a broader range of different distribution requirements you might want to ask elsewhere.\n\nA: Tiny Core Linux is a distribution of Linux that fit in 8 MB for the CLI (command line interface) version and 12 MB for the basic GUI (graphical user interface) version. These include a package manager so the system can be easily extended.\nAll you really need for a functional system is the kernel, usually some form of libc (for running C applications), and some form of command shell. Tiny Core uses Busybox to contain many core utilities, including a shell, into a tiny executable that runs in userspace. You also need some form of root filesystem ad initramfs, but that can be done with a RAM Disk.\nThat's all that's really needed if you're a crazy minimalist. Having just the Linux kernel and a shell (with some utilities) won't get you much in the ways of ease-of-use, but it will work. Embedded hardware (cell phones, TV's, and WiFi routers) usually use some minimalistic version of Linux.\nTake a look at Arch Linux, Gentoo, and Linux from Scratch (ordered from easiest to hardest) for minimalist distributions that can be used in daily life.\n\nA: Ubuntu has the minimal install which is just grub, kernel and enough networking to be then able to download whatever else you may want to add.\nhttp://www.psychocats.net/ubuntu/minimal\nhttps://help.ubuntu.com/community/Installation/MinimalCD\nhttps://help.ubuntu.com/community/Lubuntu/Documentation/MinimalInstall\n", "Q: My system update requires installation of untrusted packages I'm trying to install the latest updates from my software manager and it wants me to install untrusted packages?

Are parallel scanners supported?\nI've got an Epson action scanner that I've used under Windows as a back up in case my sub died... well, it did. Tried to use the parallel, and it wasn't even recognised.\n\nA: I have in the past with my HP Scanjet [mine is a flatbed scanner], however I was using 12.04 at the time. I used SimpleScan [built into Ubuntu] for this. I think it just worked, but you may need to find drivers somewhere for it on the internet, likely the Epson website.\nI hope this helps you make it work.\n", "Q: Can´t force upgrade to Tomcat 7.0.42 from Ubuntu 12.04 (Precise Pangolin) I Want to use tomcat support to Websocket, but it has to be above tomcat version 7.0.26 which comes with Ubuntu 12.04.2 LTS. \nI don´t want to run it stand-alone, want to try to solve it with apt-get.\nIn a 12.10 release the tomcat version is 7.0.30, but I don´t want to do a release upgrade to a non-LTS option, any ideas ?\nThanks\n\nA: Just download the Tomcat 7.0.42 binaries from its => homepage.\nExtract it to a appropriate directory, e.g. /opt/tomcat and chown to proper user:group. Then you can start using it, start and stop scripts are in $CATALINA_HOME/bin. You don't have to use the Debian / Ubuntu package anyway.\nNOTE: the configuration files will be under $CATALINA_HOME/conf instead of /etc/tomcat7. Also, if you want it to be started using sysvinit or upstart, you may need to change the init script a little bit and use update-rc.d or manually create symbolic links in /etc/rcX.d directory.\n", "Q: External monitor not detected on 13.04 on a Dell XPS 13 via Mini DP I upgraded my Dell XPS 13 Developer Edition laptop from 12.04 to 13.04 and now it seems the Mini Display Port isn't working at all. I've tried using an Apple-branded Mini DP to VGA adaptor and a generic Mini DP to HDMI adaptor and neither is detected.

By removing that file (move it to a safe place in case you are scared...) and rebooting all went fine again.\n\nA: Mine possibly exhibits similar behaviour.  When I boot up, it gets as far as the login screen on the external monitor, then when I log in, the monitor goes blank and it switches back to the laptop display.  I've found if I unplug and plug in the DisplayPort at this point (or turn the monitor off and on again), the display then switches from the laptop screen to the external monitor.\nDon't know whether this will help you, as I've installed Kubuntu desktop on mine, and Unity might behave a bit differently, but it's worth a try.\nOut of interest, did you upgrade to 13.04 due to 12.04 stability issues on XPS13?\n", "Q: How to add 'Volume up, muted' keyboard command?

Where can I call this command directly?\n\nA: The sound notification you can disable it in the Sound preferences:\n\nThere isn't still an easy way to disable certain sound events. But you can use direct commands to the alsa server to do this:\namixer set Master 10%+ ## Increase the volume by 10%\namixer set Master 10%- ## Decrease the volume by 10%\namixer set Master toggle ## Sets mute on and off\n\nThen you can create the shortcut hitting the + sign in the keyboard configuration. For people wondering why I didn't used pulseaudio, was because I don't use pulseaudio.\nPulseaudio requires more work, like:\n pactl set-source-mute 0 toggle\n pactl set-source-volume 0 +10\n pactl set-source-volume 0 -10\n\n\"This should work\" for most of cases.\n\nA: On Ubuntu 15.10 you can just press Alt + VolumeUp and Alt + VolumeDown to change the volume with an overlay notification without playing a sound notification.\n", "Q: Is the Radeon HD 7650 compatible with ubuntu?

Which all goes to confirm HD 7650M is a good choice.  \nMight be worth doing the same for your notebook model before committing!?\nObserving the flame count indicates how many people have marked themselves as affected so this also is indicative of how compatible your hardware is with Ubuntu when searching.\nTry updating to the latest release of Ubuntu to increase the chance of success without having to go hunting a suitable kernel for your hardware that is being used.\nProblems do come and go due to updates but these get fixed or you can load an older kernel where hardware compatibility is known to be good.\nI used to use nvidia but after using ATI will not look back!\nIt might be worth reminding you most things that are cheap are cheap for a reason!\n\nA: also check your Notebook here: https://wiki.ubuntu.com/HardwareSupport\n\nA: I think it will work just fine for you, however, I do not see it on the Radeon Drivers supported cards list here\n", "Q: How to create my own screenlet I am using 1 year ubuntu as my main OS already and I feel comfortable with the enviroment and the tools it provides.

I'm learning Vim for programming on my lubuntu laptop, but the dark blue color for comments makes my eyes melt. It looks better when using :set background=dark but it does not seem to remember this between sessions. I am a bit scared of changing the syncolor.vim file. Is there another way to make Vim remember this setting?\n\nA: Short answer: add that line (without the colon) to your ~/.vimrc file\nset background=dark\n\nYup, just edit the vi settings file with vi. Create it if it doesn't exist. You can also address syntax coloring individually. Add this to .vimrc:\nhi Comment  term=none  ctermfg=magenta  guifg=Magenta\n\nVim also supports entire, ridiculously complex suites of syntax color schemes. This comes down to picking a scheme you like from, say vimninjas.com or vim.org, dropping the color scheme file (molokai.vim, say) into the ~/.vim/colors directory that you made just now, and adding this to .vimrc:\ncolorscheme molokai\n\nOther programmer-friendly .vimrc settings I think you'll like:\nset scrolloff=3\nset incsearch\nset hlsearch\nhi IncSearch ctermfg=blue ctermbg=white\n\nThose affect searching, and adjust the view when you move near the top or bottom edge. Add that last line BTW, only if you don't set a color scheme.

I'm having the same problem. Delete the old Art_cache folder and try again.\n\nA: I am not an expert neither in ubuntu nor minidlna - but I got my minidlna server finally up an running on ubuntu server 12.04 (today!) and therefore came across some issues (and know how desperate one can be in case you are close to the target but not there).\nFirst suspect: minidlna confuses something in its internal database.\nTherefore delete files.db, under Ubuntu 12.04 you need something like (potentially with sudo on top):\nrm /var/lib/minidlna/files.db\n\nand restart minidlna + wait (it will create the file anew)\nSecond suspect: You have some white spaces in your path:\n/media/somnambulist/Ghost In You\n\nLinux and some programming languages are a bit picky on that - potentially this could cause some issues internally in minidlna in case it is not properly dealt with.\nTry instead:\n/media/somnambulist/Ghost_In_You\n\n(i.e. change the name of the directory plus the settings in the minidlna.conf file)\nPotentially you need to delete the files.db again as well for this second suspect. \nWhatever the outcome is on the second suspect - please post the result so that others can benefit as well. The first suspect/tip one can find on the web already.\nNo guarantees - but worth a try.\n\nA: Your problem is file permissions. If you are new to Linux then you should invest a little time in understanding how the file permissions work.\nThe minidlna server runs as a separate process to you, and will normally have the username minidlna specified in the minidlna.conf file.\n# Specify the user name or uid to run as.\nuser=minidlna\n\nThe database is normally in the directory\n# Path to the directory that should hold the database and album art cache.\ndb_dir=/var/cache/minidlna\n\nCheck the permissions and owner of this directory\n~$ stat /var/cache/minidlna\n  File: /var/cache/minidlna\n  Size: 4096        Blocks: 8          IO Block: 4096   directory\nDevice: 801h/2049d  Inode: 1967306     Links: 3\nAccess: (0750/drwxr-x---)  Uid: (  127/minidlna)   Gid: (  134/minidlna)\nAccess: 2020-04-26 11:39:36.340582338 +0100\nModify: 2020-07-07 08:35:11.796748628 +0100\nChange: 2020-07-07 08:35:11.796748628 +0100\n Birth: 2020-04-26 11:39:36.340582338 +0100\n\nIn the Access the first rwx is the owner permissions, the r-x is the group permissions, and the last --- is global. So the minidlna users can read, write, and execute this file, the execute bit means you can do a file listing when applied to a directory. To see this in action try:\n~$ ll /var/cache/minidlna/\nls: cannot open directory '/var/cache/minidlna/': Permission denied\n~$ sudo ls -l /var/cache/minidlna/\ntotal 4504\ndrwxr-xr-x 3 minidlna root    4096 Jul  7 08:35 art_cache\n-rw-r--r-- 1 minidlna root 4603904 Nov  8 01:47 files.db\n\nIn the first ll command my normal user does not have the x permission on this directory. But the permissions for the database file are correctly set.\nThe other problem you mention is the squashing of the directory structure. This is partly a function of the client, but if the client supports it select folder based presentation. By default minidlna should have these options set.\n# URL presented to clients (e.g. http://example.com:80).\npresentation_url=/\n# Set this to merge all media_dir base contents into the root container\n# (The default is no.)\nmerge_media_dirs=no\n\n\nA: Try to change from umask=007 to umask=002 and remount partition.

Anyone know when it's coming or how I can get it to install? \n\nA: The version 3.2 just landed to Debian sid, from there, it should pass to testing, then to Ubuntu. I see lots of work there.

I don't understand why that would be a problem with a fresh installation.\nAny pointers would be greatly appreciated.\nThanks,\n\nA: I had the exact same error today after updating a development server of ours. I tried many things including adding prints to the pg_ctlcluster script to trace what was going on ($logsize ends up being set to an unitialized value and in my case the socket itself was never created) as well as complete purge/reinstalls and couldn't get anything to work.\nI compared permissions against a production server with the same OS (12.04 LTS in my case) and /var/run/postgres as well as lib and other directories all matched so couldn't see anything immediate there. Likewise the logfile as specified by pg_ctlcluster was owned by postgres and also looked ok.\nAt a loss I tried setting the log file to a directory I knew would definitely be writeable and accessible, namely /tmp by amending the /etc/postgresql/9.1/main/pg_ctl.conf file thus:\n# Automatic pg_ctl configuration\n# This configuration file contains cluster specific options to be passed to\n# pg_ctl(1).\n\npg_ctl_options = '-l /tmp/pg.log'\n\nPostgres was then able to start, I was able to connect and create roles and the configuration was able to pass. I am unsure as yet what is causing this - I gather it's permission related somehow. Am just glad to finally be able to carry on - I just needed to do a few tests and was only expecting to spend an hour on it! If I find out what on earth was the cause I will update - I've seen only a few references (a Google search came up with ~6 results total for the particular $logsize error) to this between Debian, Ubuntu and Linux Mint. It strikes me as odd though that more people haven't encountered this - making me think it's something rather specific and rare.\nedit possibly related I also had difficulty in getting solr to work earlier. it was also related to a log file not being wrote to.

I recently tried to install window 7, downgrading from windows 8 but the hard drive rejected the os, telling me that GPT hdd does not support win7. I was wondering if Ubuntu can be installed instead for now. Thank you\n\nA: Yes, Ubuntu supports both \"MSDOS\"-style partition tables and GPT partition tables.\nIf Secure Boot is also enabled, and you want to install Ubuntu alongside Windows 8, see this question.\nIf you just want to install Ubuntu by itself, then you shouldn't have to do anything special, even if you have a GPT disk. See this generic installation question and these generic instructions.\nAlthough this works most of the time, sometimes the GRUB boot loader will not be installed correctly. So if you cannot boot after installing, see this answer or the techniques presented here (they apply to this situation, even though this situation is not a recent installation of Windows).\nAlternatively, if Ubuntu will be the only OS you want on your machine (or all the OSes you want on your machine will work without UEFI and GPT), then you may consider disabling EFI in your \"BIOS\" setup and creating an MS-DOS style partition table on your disk.\n", "Q: changed home permissions during an install of Ubuntu 13.04. I had my home partition deleted by the operating system. 13.04 install had reformatted the whole drive. I managed to recover &  get my home partition onto a removable drive using Puppy Linux ( thanks Puppy).I formatted my hard drive & again made  a separate partition for my home directory. I copied the home files from the removable drive to the new partition. I cannot access my home files from the new Ubuntu install. I get a message that the file is root, & I do not have permission.\nI used Puppy to change the permissions, I can now get access but each file has a \"padlock icon\"in the corner.\nI cant change the permission with SU in Ubuntu.

Could someone please help me to get rid of the **padlock.\n Is there an alternative to Ubuntu that is not so restrictive with SU permissions & preferably has a graphical interface for root?. Frustrated.\n\nA: \nI cant change the permission with SU in Ubuntu.\n\nUse sudo (not su), and change ownership, not permissions, unless you're totally sure the ownership is already correct.\nIf you are logged in on the Ubuntu system, them you can get ownership of your home folder and all its contents by running:\nsudo chown -R $USER:$USER $HOME\n\nThat can entered (copied and pasted, or typed in) exactly; you do not need to (and should not) replace USER or HOME with anything.\nIf you cannot log in to the Ubuntu system and are accessing it on an Ubuntu live CD/DVD/USB or from another Unix-like OS (such as Puppy Linux), then this command will probably do what you want (an Ubuntu system's first user almost always has UID 1000):\nsudo chown -R 1000:1000 /home/username\nFor that command, you do have to replace username with your actual username on the Ubuntu system.\n\nA: I think that you can open the file manager (nautillus) by right clicking inside it and select open as root.\nAlternatively, \nIn the command line you could type-\ngksudo nautillus\n\nwhich would open the file manager as root and here you can modify the file permissions.\nPS. it could be nautilus also.\n", "Q: upgrade to Ubuntu 12.04 I am using Ubuntu 10.04.3, now I want to upgrade to Ubuntu 12.04.2 as some software's which I need for my academic purpose can't be installed in this version.

I deleted my Windows partition so I can make more space for my Ubuntu partition (making the switch out of Windows.) but I found out that you can't resize to the left, is there any way I can use the unallocated space? (that's why I added the quotes around left in the question)\nIf you need an image...\n\nA: You can resize to the left or right, it is written as space preceeding and space following.\nBut\nFirst you will have to boot from a live disk inorder to resize your partitions on your hard disk.\nThen you will have to first resize your extended partition.\nThen you would be able to resize your ubuntu partition,\nBUT it would give a warning that moving root partitons can lead to boot failure.\nSo best option is to right click on the unallocated space and click on new to create a new partition, choose type as ext4.\nThis partiton you could use in ubuntu to store your data instead of resizing the ubuntu partition.\n\nA: gparted will let you move and resize partitions.  If you move the start of a partition it will need to do it in two operations, a move and a resize (the order of which depends on which direction you move it).\nYou will obviously need to do this from a live CD, because you can't move a partition that is currently in use.\n\nA: Aaditya Bagga and neon_overload are both correct; however, I want to add that any partition resizing operation is somewhat risky, and any operation that moves the start point of the partition is especially risky. The reason should be clear from the other users' answers: Such operations involve more manipulation of data than a resize from the end of the partition. This increases the time involved (and therefore the risk from a power failure or system crash) and simply gives more opportunities for any of a million other potential problems to crop up. I don't want to overstate this, though; the risk of failure is still fairly small. The trouble is that the consequences of failure can often be dire, particularly if you lack good backups.\nInstead of resizing the partition in this way, you might want to consider creating a new partition in the empty space and mounting it somewhere convenient in your directory tree. You can then either populate it with new files or move existing files there. The details of what you might do depend on the sizes of existing partitions and of the space you've freed, how you're using your system, etc. Therefore, I can't be very specific with suggestions.\nIf you really want or need to resize the partition from the start, I strongly recommend doing a backup of that partition to an external medium before you begin.\n", "Q: dual boot on acer chromebook i am using an Acer Chromebook. i have switched operating systems to Ubuntu 12.04 but couldn't watch Netflix so someone told me there is a way to dual boot so wen my laptop comes on, i can choose which operating system. i would love that and use Ubuntu 12.04 (or higher) and Chrome OS.

Error No such file or directory Please ask your system \nadministrator to enable user sharing.\n\n\nA: Quick Answer\nUse gksudo nautilus or sudo -H nautilus or sudo -i nautilus instead.\nExplanation\nYou shouldn't use plain sudo to run graphical applications, because it makes root and your non-root user account try to use the same configuration files, which often causes root to own files that the non-root user needs to (but cannot) access.\nRecent versions of Nautilus will actually recognize this problem and refuse to run, in order to prevent their per-user configuration from being broken on your non-root user account.\nThe solution to this problem is, when running graphical programs as root (especially Nautilus), use a method that avoids this problem. The methods that avoid this problem are the methods that make the program you're running look for and create configuration files in root's home directory (/root), rather than your own home directory (/home/ussername).\nThe Solutions, and Why They Work\nThe HOME environment variable is usually consulted to determine the home directory to be used. You want this to be set to /root. You don't do this directly; instead, run graphical applications in a way that does this for you automatically.\nTraditionally, all Ubuntu systems had gksudo or (for Kubuntu) kdesudo installed, and you would use them instead of sudo when running graphical applications. That might work; I recommend you try replacing sudo with gksudo before you try anything else. Unfortunately, gksudo is not always installed on the newest versions of Ubuntu. You can, of course, install it (in the Software Center or with sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install gksu).\nAlso, please note that traditionally, on Ubuntu, gksu and gksudo did the same thing. But a recent bug sometimes makes gksu behave in a way that doesn't work right for an Ubuntu system. This is why I recommend gksudo, even though I have usually recommended gksu (which does \"the right thing\" on many different Unix-like systems, when properly configured).\nBut there are alternatives to gksudo. You can tell sudo to run a program as root and use root's home directory instead of yours:\nsudo -H nautilus\nIf you don't have gksudo, I recommend sudo -H. However, you can also use:\nsudo -i nautilus\nsudo -i simulates a full root login (even if actual root logins are disabled), which sets many environment variables, including HOME, to their root-user values.\n(After the command is run, and in other programs or other commands that are not started from the program you're running as root, the environment remains unchanged. You never have to \"change it back.\")\n", "Q: Program for Ubuntu that opens .mbf format? I just cleaned up a computer and installed linux on it in place of vista.

Is there an alternative program for Microsoft Money that is available for Ubuntu that can open and read these files just as effectively?\nI'll most likely be installing windows 7 over Linux if the version of 7 I have is compatible, since this will be a general house computer with multiple users, so the issue will be resolved that way.

It's always appreciated. \n\nA: I've used GnuCash before, which I've found excellent. I've never used Microsoft Money though, so I can't compare the features directly. You can import from Microsoft Money, although you'll have to export in QIF format first.\nIf you hate GnuCash, and really want to go back to Microsoft Money, you can always install it via Wine or a Virtual Windows machine (e.g. through VirtualBox).\n", "Q: How to install Diamond XtremeSound 5.1. sound card driver for 12.04?

The picture actually only confirms DVD/USB booted using UEFI and there will be some means in firmware settings to ensure drives are booted in order to make UEFI installer run - possibly. See UEFI - Community Ubuntu Documentation for some info.\nThe SATA set to AHCI is good. What you need to check is first disable SECURE BOOT in firmware settings. If that does not get Ubuntu installer running. Try disabling anything mentioning UEFI in firmware settings.  \nOr if you can not find UEFI settings; Does your machine have CSM setting?; if so switch it on - this will disable the UEFI booting of installer and then allow a legacy/bios install of Ubuntu.  \nManual found here and looking at page 64 shows instruction for booting other OS (not Windows) The note at top of page demands RAID0 must be set at default settings.\n\nA: This might not be an full answer, but a simple tip that might solve the problem.\nTry installing a 32-bit version of Ubuntu 13.04 (as it is faster than 12.04) on a DIFFERENT USB Drive.

The next time I booted, the launcher didn't start, the toolbar on the top wasn't showing. Only the desktop and my few work folders remained on the screen, there's and only an error showed the first time \"compiz has failed to launch\" or something, I click launch again but it doesn't do anything.

My take on this is that the correct driver for your card, a GEForce 6 series card, is the nvidia-304 series driver, which should be the correct driver to work with your card. If you can try the command:\nsudo apt-get install nvidia-304\n\nyou might be able to quickly recover from the issue you are presently experiencing on another laptop.\nUPDATE: Apparently as commented below, that package is not available in 12.10.\nIf you have a way to tell which package is the same as the Nvidia 304 driver, that is the one you want.\nIf expediency matters more, you could install the official release from here by following the instructions here.\nUPDATE 2: Have you tried booting into recovery mode and determining if that will work?\nAlso, could you add the Xorg.0.log or the errors from same to the issue?

After manually installing Ubuntu 13.04 ('something else' option), the PC would boot straight to Windows. \nI tried to reinstall the grub via ChRoot--following instructions indicated in various forums: e.g. https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Grub2/Installing#Reinstalling_GRUB_2 (but to no avail)--and then, after, using Boot-Repair--I went for the reccomended repair settings--, which generated the following URL (http://paste.ubuntu.com/5978031/) and invited me to make my BIOS boot on the sda2/EFI/Ubuntu/shimx64.efi file. After rebooting, the error message in the subject line above appeared, and I was not able to set any such sda2/EFI/Ubuntu/shimx64.efi as the default boot device when I accessed the BIOS.\nI have had a look at similar threads without finding anything fit for purpose.\nAny suggestions?\nThanks\n\nA: After reading several other threads and tinkering around – I installed efibootmgr at some point too -, I sorted the problem out by running Boot-Repair a second time (with Secure Boot off though), leaving all default settings, as per first time. The URL generated at the end of the process was http://paste.ubuntu.com/5982069/\nInterestingly, I read somewhere that Ubuntu 13.04 is Secure Boot compatible; however, when I turned this feature back on and restarted the machine, I incurred in a ‘validation error’, and the system booted straight to Windows 8. I’ve therefore decided to leave it off for good!\nBraiam and Oldfred, thank you both for your input and suggestions, much appreciated.\n\nA: It looks like you ran the rename function of Boot-Repair. That is for systems that only boot the Windows efi file (hardcoded in UEFI).\nrenamed /EFI/microsoft/boot/shimx64.efi to bootmgfw.efi.\nbootmgfw.efi to bkpbootmgfw.efi\nSo you would still boot Windows from UEFI menu and it will really boot to grub menu. From grub menu you can boot the backed up Windows file. \nIf you can boot ubuntu directly in UEFI menu you can undo the rename.\nTo undo & to rename files to their original names, you just need to tick the \"Restore EFI backups\" option of Boot-Repair. \nDo you have secure boot on?

Everything is working, short of the remote. I've configured my remote, and it I start lirc from the command line, it works fine. If I run it from the init script service lirc start it doesn't work. (For this purpose, work means to have irw show an output). In both cases I'm using exactly the same command (in fact, for running it from the command line, I'm just copying the command that is present in ps -ef).

Note that in my case some of the keys worked, but only when lirc was not running (neither as a service nor a command).\nThe problem was that evdev (an input driver for Xorg) was picking up the remote as a keyboard input device. Getting evdev to ignore the remote solved the problem for me. I guess that the lirc service start script got hung up by the fact that evdev had a handle on the remote, somehow.\nThe problem is detailed in this thread: http://www.tbsdtv.com/forum/viewtopic.php?f=22&t=2896&sid=f8d407bf0e7a02db70439a41ea2adc3c\nThe following is from the last post in that thread. Note: TBS6981 is the satellite tuner which I was using as my remote receiver.\n\nThe problem was caused by evdev (an input driver for Xorg) which was picking up the remote as a keyboard input device. This could be seen from my Xorg logs (/var/log/Xorg...), see below. Most of the buttons don't work by default because they don't naturally map to keyboard buttons, e.g. your keyboard doesn't have an EPG key, but it does have numbers and direction keys.\nThere are basically two solutions\n  \n  \n*\n  \n*Configure evdev to ignore the IR input and use lirc OR\n  \n*Remap the remote buttons to keyboard keys, as discussed in this post, and don't use lirc\n  \n  \n  evdev can be configured to ignore the TBS6981 as a keyboard by adding the following to the end of /usr/share/X11/xorg.conf.d/10-evdev.conf - \nSection \"InputClass\"\n        Identifier \"cx23885 IR (TurboSight TBS 6981)\"\n        MatchProduct \"cx23885 IR (TurboSight TBS 6981)\"\n        MatchIsKeyboard \"on\"\n        Option \"Ignore\"\nEndSection\n\nNote that MatchProduct above matches the identifier found in Xorg.0.log.\nThis is an extract from Xorg.0.log showing evdev picking the remote input, these lines do not appear if evdev is correctly configured to ignore the remote as a keyboard:\n[    21.486] (II) config/udev: Adding input device cx23885 IR (TurboSight TBS 6981) (/dev/input/event3)\n[    21.486] (**) cx23885 IR (TurboSight TBS 6981): Applying InputClass \"evdev keyboard catchall\"\n[    21.486] (II) Using input driver 'evdev' for 'cx23885 IR (TurboSight TBS 6981)'\n[    21.486] (II) Loading /usr/lib/xorg/modules/input/evdev_drv.so\n[    21.486] (**) cx23885 IR (TurboSight TBS 6981): always reports core events\n[    21.486] (**) evdev: cx23885 IR (TurboSight TBS 6981): Device: \"/dev/input/event3\"\n[    21.486] (--) evdev: cx23885 IR (TurboSight TBS 6981): Vendor 0x6981 Product 0x8888\n[    21.486] (--) evdev: cx23885 IR (TurboSight TBS 6981): Found keys\n[    21.486] (II) evdev: cx23885 IR (TurboSight TBS 6981): Configuring as keyboard\n[    21.486] (**) Option \"config_info\" \"udev:/sys/devices/pci0000:00/0000:00:04.0/0000:02:00.0/rc/rc0/input3/event3\"\n[    21.486] (II) XINPUT: Adding extended input device \"cx23885 IR (TurboSight TBS 6981)\" (type: KEYBOARD, id 8)\n\n\nSo, first step is look for lines in your /var/log/Xorg.0.log showing evdev picking up your remote receiver, then configure \n/usr/share/X11/xorg.conf.d/10-evdev.conf to ignore the receiver using the id for the receiver as found in Xorg.0.log.\n", "Q: XFCE windows drawing buggy I just upgraded to raring, and accidentally installed proposed updates.\nNow Chrome and Sublime Text are not drawn correctly.\nHere is my sources.list\n#############################################################\n################### OFFICIAL UBUNTU REPOS ###################\n#############################################################\n\n###### Ubuntu Main Repos\ndeb http://sa.archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/ raring main restricted universe multiverse \n\n###### Ubuntu Update Repos\ndeb http://sa.archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/ raring-security main restricted universe multiverse \ndeb http://sa.archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/ raring-updates main restricted universe multiverse \n#deb http://sa.archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/ raring-proposed main restricted universe multiverse \ndeb http://sa.archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/ raring-backports main restricted universe multiverse \n\n###### Ubuntu Partner Repo\ndeb http://archive.canonical.com/ubuntu raring partner\n\n###### Ubuntu Extras Repo\ndeb http://extras.ubuntu.com/ubuntu raring main\n\n##############################################################\n##################### UNOFFICIAL  REPOS ######################\n##############################################################\n\n###### 3rd Party Binary Repos\n\n#### Banshee -

That's wha the \"ServerName\" directive is there for. It will serve those who try to ener that ServerName.\nSo if you're only testing things on your localhost, just use the same VirtualHost and use subfolders. One site in: /var/www/site1 and the other in /var/www/site2, and point your browser to: http://localhost/site1 or http://localhost/site2.\nAnother solution if you don't want to have subfolders in your URL is to bypass your DNS lookup and just force some domain lookups throught the /etc/hosts file. Here is an example (You want to add to the 127.0.0.1 line at the end):\nfile: /etc/hosts\n127.0.0.1 localhost example.com example.org\n\nYour /etc/hosts file might look different, just remember to add the two domains to the end because as I explained earlier, Apache will only serve you one VirtualHost to the same ServerName.\nFor more information: http://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.2/vhosts/examples.html\n\nA: I didn't know about this, but I played around for a few minutes to see how it works.\nI think you were doing it right but, as already mentioned, you must add something like ServerName www.site1.com to the configuration (not localhost). Then enable the site, restart Apache, etc.\nAlso, as noted in http://httpd.apache.org/docs/current/vhosts/examples.html : \"Apache server does not magically cause DNS entries to be created for those host names. You must have the names in DNS, resolving to your IP address\".\nFor local testing, you can edit the /etc/hosts file and add the site name (the www.site1.com used above) as alias for localhost, by changing the line that says 127.0.0.1 localhost to 127.0.0.1 localhost www.site1.com (replace www.site1.com by the name of your site). Then restart your browser and point it to the name of your site, to see if it works.\nOr you could forget all these configurations and simply write localhost/mywebsite in your browser to access your site, but it seems it's not what you want.\n", "Q: Asus N56V - Instant key is there a way to make the Instant key of an asus N56V work under Ubuntu/Xubuntu?\nI'm using Xubuntu 13.04. I'm trying to set a function for this Instant key thru Setting Manager->Keyboard, but I'm not able (the key is not recognized).\nHowever, this is what I get using xev and pressing the Instant key:\nKeyPress event, serial 37, synthetic NO, window 0x2200001,\nroot 0x9f, subw 0x0, time 3698815, (169,-16), root:(763,301),\nstate 0x0, keycode 248 (keysym 0x0, NoSymbol), same_screen YES,\nXLookupString gives 0 bytes: \nXmbLookupString gives 0 bytes: \nXFilterEvent returns: False\n\nKeyRelease event, serial 37, synthetic NO, window 0x2200001,\nroot 0x9f, subw 0x0, time 3698815, (169,-16), root:(763,301),\nstate 0x0, keycode 248 (keysym 0x0, NoSymbol), same_screen YES,\nXLookupString gives 0 bytes: \nXFilterEvent returns: False\n\nHow can I make it work?\n\nA: I have similar laptop and I found the solution here: http://dev-loki.blogspot.com/2006/04/mapping-unsupported-keys-with-xmodmap.html\nBasically you have the keycode and the next step is to map this code to a key symbol (keysym). To load automatically the binding at startup you have to create .Xmodmap file in your home directory. This file is being red by xmodmap when the X-Server is started.\nAdd the following line in .Xmodmap:\nkeycode 248 = F13\n\nand save the file. To load the mapping manually for the first time run xmodmap ~/.Xmodmap in terminal. Now you can use the key to make a keyboard shortcut in Xfce.\n", "Q: How to avoid normal users from accessing others likewise home folder? How can I avoid normal users from accessing other users home folders? \nAll the users login via AD a/c but here in Ubuntu 12.04 anyone can easily access other users home folder including Administrator directory how am I able to avoid this happening?\n\nA: By default i think that only the creator of a file or folder can access it, but in your case it seems to be different.\nYou could change the permissions for your home folders by opening a root file manager by\ngksudo nautillus\n\nand then right click on the respective home folders, navigate to the permissions tab and change them as you like.\nthere would be an option like-\n'allow other users to view and edit the files'\nuncheck it to prevent other users to access each other's files.\n", "Q: not able to install g++ This is what I

And therefore will tell you when cmd doesn't exist. (Which is what you want in this case)\n\n\nA: While putting cd ~/Desktop/Java\\ Files into the .bashrc file does work, it has the terrible side-effect of overriding the Nautilus Open in Terminal action, so you can no longer open any other sub-folder in a terminal.\nMy solution is to change the Keyboard Shortcut in Settings for Ctrl+Alt+T to run this command:\n/usr/bin/gnome-terminal --working-directory=\"/home/butch/Documents\" \n\nThis will open new terminal windows in my Documents folder, while allowing Nautilus to open new terminal windows wherever.\nNote this command does not accept ~/Documents, the full path must be specified.\n\nA: Add this to your ~/.bashrc file.\nIf you open terminal from nautilus in your home directory, it will unfortunately still cd. I'm not sure how escaping works, but this might not work if your current directory or home directory has unescaped characters.\nif [ \"$PWD\" == \"$HOME\" ]; then cd Desktop/Java\\ Files/; fi\n\n\nA: You can add the following line to the end of your ~/.bashrc\ncd ~/Desktop/Java\\ Files\n\nA: Just to add\nIf someone is using zsh shell than\nnano ~/.zshrc ( open the configuration file)\n\nand at bootom add \ncd ~/Desktop/Java\\ Files\n\nso the tweak is what ever shell you are using (echo $0 ) just add the command you usually use and it will be executed.\n\nA: First you need to know what shell you are using. Acces the rc file of that shell. In normal Ubuntu shell, it is ~/.bashrc and in zsh shell it is ~/.zshrc. Then add a line at the bottom that says:\ncd <Destination>\n\nFor a windows destination, use /mnt/<harddrive>. For a Ubuntu destination, just use ~<destination>.\nExample(zsh shell and windows path):\nvim ~/.zshrc\ncd /mnt/c/Desktop\n\nHope this helps.\n\nA: GNOME Terminal has an option within the user's profiles called \"Preserve working directory\" and probably this is what you need to tweak.\n\nI'm posting this here, because one more suitable Terminal opens in incorrect directory is marked as duplication of this one.\n", "Q: Problem with USB installation (xbmcbuntu) This question is about XBMCbuntu, which is basically ubuntu - So I hope it is okay to ask:\nIv'e been trying for the last many hours to install xbmcbuntu.

I've installed Subversion and Apache. Is there something else i need to install to get it to work? \n\nA: After that you have to configure your server for SVN.\nServer Configuration\nThis step assumes you have installed above mentioned packages on your system. This section explains how to create SVN repository and access the project.\nCreate SVN Repository\nThere are several typical places to put a Subversion repository; most common places are: /srv/svn, /usr/local/svn and /home/svn. For clarity's sake, we'll assume we are putting the Subversion repository in /home/svn, and your project's name is simply 'myproject'\nThere are also several common ways to set permissions on your repository. However, this area is the most common source of errors in installation, so we will cover it thoroughly. Typically, you should choose to create a new group called 'subversion' that will own the repository directory. To do this \n\n\n*\n\n*Choose System > Administration > Users and Groups from your Ubuntu menu.\n\n*Click the 'Manage Groups' button.\n\n*Click the 'Add' button.\n\n*Name the group 'subversion'\n\n*Add yourself and www-data (the Apache user) as users to this group\n(Note: in order to see www-data you may need to see FixShowAllUsers) \nClick 'OK', then click 'Close' twice to commit your changes and exit the app. \nYou have to logout and login again before you are a member of the subversion group, and can do check ins.\nNow issue the following commands:\n   $ sudo mkdir /home/svn\n   $ cd /home/svn\n   $ sudo mkdir myproject\n\nThe SVN repository can be created using the following command:\n   $ sudo svnadmin create /home/svn/myproject\n\nAnd use the following commands to correct file permissions:\n   $ cd /home/svn\n   $ sudo chown -R www-data:subversion myproject\n   $ sudo chmod -R g+rws myproject\n\nThe last command sets gid for proper permissions on all new files added to your Subversion repository.\nIf you want to use WebDAV as an access method described below, repeat the chmod -R g+rws myproject command again. This is because svnadmin will create directories and files without group write access. This is no problem for read only access or using the custom svn protocol but when Apache tries to commit changes to the repository linux will deny it access. Also the owner and group are set as root. This can be changed by repeating the chown and chgrp commands listed above. \nCredit goes to Ubuntu-Community \nfor more information : subversion \ninformation about adding users/groups : Ubuntu -Community \n\nA: To install Subversion, run the following command from a terminal prompt:\nsudo apt-get install subversion libapache2-svn\nI have searched and came to know that Ubuntu have a good Documentation for Subversion that can help you to get more information on usage of it.\nhttps://help.ubuntu.com/12.04/serverguide/subversion.html\n", "Q: How to update Ubuntu 13.04 from 12.04?

(I understand you might have been running it as root to try to work around another problem; I've addressed this below.) If you run it as a normal user and try to install or remove software, it will ask you for your password to perform just that action as root. It does this automatically.\nThe actual condition you've experienced when running Software Center as root with sudo is probably a bug, but it's somewhat common for bugs to occur in software that is run as root, when the developers didn't intend for it to be run that way.\nI recommend reporting a bug, but running Software Center not as root will probably solve your problem. (Just run: software-center)\nAs for the problem of the Software Center not listing any software: make sure Software Center is not running, then try removing your user-specific Software Center configuration files, its global configuration files, and reinstalling it. To do all that, open a Terminal window (Ctrl+Alt+T) and run:\nsudo killall software-center\nsudo killall -KILL software-center\ncd ~/.config && sudo rm -r software-center\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get --purge --reinstall install software-center\n\n(Normally it would not be necessary to run rm -r software-center with sudo, but since you've attempted to run software-center as root with straight sudo at least once, root might own files contained in that directory. In the future, to run a graphical program as root, you should generally use gksudo, sudo -H, or sudo -i and not plain sudo.)\nAfter running those commands, try running software-center (not as root, not with sudo) and see if it works. If it does not, then please edit your question to include all the text from the terminal starting with the beginning of the line on which you entered the first command listed above, and continuing through the end of the output of software-center.\n", "Q: Restore default boot OS to Chrome OS I am having a problem with ChrUbuntu and setting the default OS back to Chrome OS.

You can learn what the device will do with:\nsudo iwlist wlan0 auth\n\nOf course, substitute your wireless interface if it's not wlan0.

Its main use is in simulation of\n  communication systems and for performing research in the area of\n  communications. The kernel of the library consists of generic vector\n  and matrix classes, and a set of accompanying routines. Such a kernel\n  makes IT++ similar to MATLAB, GNU Octave or SciPy.\n\nWriting and reading data from files\n\nHere we will use the it_file class to store some data. The program\n  write_it_file.cpp looks as follows: ... When you run this program you\n  will obtain a file called it_file_test.it in your current directory.\n  You can read the file into Matlab/Octave to view the data by using the\n  following commands: \nitload('it_file_test.it') \nfigure(1); \nclf; \nplot(a)\n\n\nAnd then they give an example of a C++ program to read an .it file.

I've tried this on my own several ways by reading wiki, and other peoples problems by creating 10-monitor.conf in /usr/share/X11/xorg.conf.d, and rebooting i've also tried all repository nvidia drivers, ive also tried editing the xorg.conf in /etc/X11/ but i know im doing something wrong, something simple. I just now did a fresh install of 12.04 and did updates, and restarted, I have no proprietary nvidia drivers in use or a xorg.conf generated.

First know your refresh rate. Mine is 60Hz. Magnavox 19inch HD widescreen, with HDMI, VGA, TV outputs. Currently I'm using my VGA output on a NVIDIA 6200 Graphics card running a clean install of Ubuntu 13.04 Unity 3D.

Then pick a resulotion you want say 1280x720 thats a 16:9 720p HD. Then type: cvt 1280 720 60, where i put 60 put your Refresh rate there.`This is what comes back\nModeline \"1280x720_60.00\"   74.50  1280 1344 1472 1664  720 723 728 748 -hsync +vsync\n\nNow copy that whole modeline from the first quote till the end, then type sudo xrandr --newmode \"1280x720_60.00\"   74.50  1280 1344 1472 1664  720 723 728 748 -hsync +vsync, nothing should return, then type sudo xrandr --addmode VGA-1 1280x720_60.00, the screen should change right then and there and your done. See, i tried this for two days tearing my hair out, but i was only trying 1 resolution 1368x768 which wont even work anyway lol ....then i wake up this morning and thought about it. and googled a true list of all 16:9 resolutions, http://pacoup.com/2011/06/12/list-of-true-169-resolutions/ and started trying these. first one i picked work, the  720p HD....took ten seconds :)\n", "Q: Can't use my TL-WN725N I'm using Ubuntu 13.04 3.8.0-27-generic and I cannot use my TL-725N nano wireless adapter.\nlsusb : \nBus 001 Device 002: ID 8087:0024 Intel Corp.

I wanted to move directory to /usr/local but instead mv -r typed rm -r.\nIs there any way to recover deleted data on Ubuntu 12.04?\nAny suggestions?\nUpdate:\nI understand that this losing not so difficult. But what about the future.\nIs any way to safe removed files (as at Windows for ex. - all deleted files gona trash) and would recover them if deleted accidentally?\nOr better use backup and it protects this really weak place at ubuntu?\n\nA: If you need to recover deleted files, it's imperative that you immediately shut down the newly installed system and not use it. You can run from a live CD provided that swap is disabled. See the guidelines here.\nHowever, most of the time, its better to replace the contents of /usr/local then to attempt recovery. At least if you were using /usr/local in a normal way.\nOrdinarily, /usr/local is used for installing software that you've compiled yourself from source code. If you have only (or mostly) used it for this purpose, then you should just reinstall the software (i.e., re-create /usr/local and build and install the programs and/or libraries like you built and installed them before).\nThis will very probably be less work, and take less time, than trying to recover the contents. And it will definitely be more reliable. Data recovery is appropriate when you have lost information that you want to retrieve--like the contents of a document that has not been backed up. But it will not reliably give you back exactly all the files you had before, where you had them before.\nIf you used /usr/local in the usual way, then you should just rebuild its contents.\nIf you don't remember what was there, that might make it hard for you to rebuild it. But it would make it even harder for you to recover it; it's very difficult (often, impossible) to recover deleted files if you don't know much about them).\nIf you never used it at all, then there's probably nothing of consequence there. So if you don't remember ever using /usr/local for anything, you can just recreate it with sudo mkdir /usr/local and do nothing else. (Its subfolders will still be missing, but anything that uses them will typically create them if they are found not to exist, so that's usually not a problem.)\nPreventing this in the Future\nThis addresses the updated portion of the question.\nComparison of File Deletion Safety Features in Ubuntu and Windows\nThe feature you're looking for would probably be more similar to System Restore in Windows, than to the Windows recycle bin. After all, when you delete files on the desktop in Ubuntu, they are sent to the trash (unless you indicate that they are to be permanently deleted, for example by pressing Shift+Delete). In the trash, they can be deleted for real (by emptying the trash) or they can be taken out of the trash. This behavior is identical to the recycle bin in Windows.\nIn both Windows and Ubuntu, when you delete files from the command-line, they are truly deleted. (That doesn't mean they are unrecoverable, but it usually means they are hard to recover and likely have unrecoverable parts.)\nWhile Ubuntu and Windows both have a logical storage area for files that are marked for deletion (the trash and the recycle bin), Ubuntu does not have any feature that corresponds to System Restore in Windows.\nMake Backups\nIf you need to safeguard against losing any data, your guess is totally right: backups are the correct solution. However, this is not a particularly \"weak place\" in Ubuntu; you can severely damage any part of your system by running rm -r as root! (Running deltree as an administrator in Windows is similarly dangerous.)\nAvoid Any Unnecessary Operations on System Directories\nMoving or renaming system directories is rare and usually unnecessary. I recommend avoiding performing any action on a top-level system directory unless you need to, especially if you cannot tolerate breakage.\nAvoid -r Except When Necessary (there is no such thing as mv -r)\nUnlike the rm command, the mv command does not have any -r flag (see man mv for details). You do not need such a flag, even to move a non-empty directory. If you avoid using -r for commands where it's not needed, and be extra-careful in the minority of instances where you do use -r, you may be able to reduce your risk of data loss or other undesirable changes to your system.\nUse gksudo nautilus (carefully!) if you want to trash instead of delete system files.\nYou can open a root file browser window by running gksudo nautilus. (In some later versions of Ubuntu, gksudo is not always installed. You can get it by installing the package gksu, or you can use sudo -H in its place. You should not use plain sudo to run graphical programs.) This gives you a graphical file-browsing interface with essentially unlimited power.\nThis carries its own dangers, and I don't think it's really safer than the command line. However, when you remove a file, it should go to the trash rather than being truly deleted. It will go to the root user's trash--not your regular user account's trash can. You can access the root user's trash from within that same root file browser window.\nSending files to the trash as root is not a very common operation, so I recommend making sure it works with an unimportant file (perhaps one you create for testing), and that you can restore the test file, before relying on this behavior of the system.\nIf you choose to use a root file browser window, please remember that, like when running commands with sudo, a mistake can have systemwide consequences. Also, any program you run from a root file browser window will itself run as root. For these reasons, I recommend always closing a root file browser window immediately, once you are doing using it.\n\nA: Take a look at Is there any way to recover files in /usr/local directory on Ubuntu? on Server Fault.\nIn summary: LapTop006 pointed out that Ubuntu packages should not install anything in /usr/local. One way to find out if they have is to run grep '/usr/local/' /var/lib/dpkg/info/*.list. This lists any that have (so its output is usually blank).\nIf you do want to try to recover data, wzzrd suggested trying ext3grep.\n\nA: In addition to Eliah's answer.\nIf you have another similar 12.04 (same up to date) installation, you may try to use tar or rsync to restore/copy (or rebuild) the directory structure. As explained, it is mainly for software compiled from source (default prefix).\nrsync example (on the broken host, copy the /usr/local from the good host via SSH, broken root partition is mounted to /mnt/broken_root):\nrsync -axAX --progress --stats root@GOOD_HOST:/usr/local /mnt/broken_root/usr\n\nNOTE: Be careful with trailing slash when using rsync.\n", "Q: best ubuntu samba guide after trying the official Ubuntu samba guide and failing, then a youtube video guide and failing to make samba work, I am asking all of you which one is best as there are so many to choose from.\nI tried ftp and nfs after these and got both to work, but found out ftp wasn't exactly a live system and windows 7 pro can't connect to nfs, so I have a good general feeling for configuration in general\nthanks\n\nA: Samba is an implementation of the Server Message Block (SMB)/Common Internet File System (CIFS) protocol for Unix systems, providing support for cross-platform file and printer sharing with Microsoft Windows, OS X, and other Unix systems. \nThe Official Samba-3 HOWTO and Reference Guide\nSamba-3 by Example\nInstall Samba Server on Ubuntu\nInstall and Configure Samba Server\nSetting Up A Linux File Server Using Samba\nConfigure Samba Sharing between Ubuntu and Windows \nI hope these help.\n", "Q: Is Ubuntu compatible with my 32 bit windows 7 system?

Just as an FYI to any answerers, my family is going out to eat fairly shortly, so I will be away for the next hour or so.

Is this information helpful to anyone?\nEDIT: I have been unable to use chkdsk on a Windows environment to recover the disk. I did something to it--I'm not sure what.

This is especially true for commands we run as root.\nNevertheless we need to do so occasionally. Most of the time we will be warned if something bad may happen. This was also the case when you had purged packages using a wildcard * to remove all packages and their dependencies containing icec*. The system did tell you what it is going to remove, and it did ask you for confirmation Y/n:\n[... long list of packages to remove]\nAfter this operation, 978 MB disk space will be freed.\nDo you want to continue [Y/n]?\n\nWhenecer you see a message like this, please make a break. Stop hitting keys, read the message and think over it again. Only if it seems exactly what you wanted you may press Y. In the case of purging icec* you will then be going to remove most of your system.\n\nTo purge a package please use the complete package name rather than a wildcard abbreviation to make sure you will not remove any packages you may still need.

\"Wired\" and \"Wireless\" are all active.\nAlso, seems that don't have a gateway set, it could be because your DHCP configuration is not being captured or that you have manually set your network configuration. If you set your network configuration Manual, you should verify that the gateway is filled out (you don't have to use the same values as my screenshot, just see what values should be filled out in case you use the Manual method):\n\nIf your method is Automatic, then try disabling your UFW.\nYour UFW rules are dropping most of your packages, consider allowing all output packages, or at least packages which destination ports are desired, from your question you need to allow output to port TCP:80 (http) and input/output UDP:53 (DHCP). You can get a full port list in this Wikipedia article. If you are not sure, just completely deactivate UFW rules, check if you have internet.\nYou can check what packages are being dropped doing a dmesg | grep UFW (it could be pretty long list).\n", "Q: No module named 'kernmagic' in ipython I'm running Ubuntu 13.04 and upon starting up ipython (0.13.2), I get this warning:\nImportError: No module named kernmagic\n\nI've tried re-installing ipython and that didn't work.

But how would I possibly specify that per kernel / kernels on a specific partition?\nNeat would be having a little text-file beside a kernel image that is evaluated by the tool-chain, but i guess that's some serious hacking through the chain.\n\nA: Copy the op-prober entry into 40_custom and edit to have the paramaters you want.

I've downloaded it to my DOWNLOADS folder in my home directly but I've heard that it's bad form to run things from your home directory.\n\nA: Keeping source code and downloaded programs right in your /home folder can get a little messy and disorganized. Saving them to your ~/Downloads folder or any other subdirectory is fine, but you have to be careful not to delete them, for example, if you go on a deleting rampage in your ~/Downloads folder to get rid of accumulated junk. As a solution to this, I have created a ~/Projects subdirectory, wherein I have individual folders for each software project, source code bundle, or other \"project\". If you don't have many Projects to keep track of, keeping them in your Downloads folder (or any folder) is fine if you don't mind the extra eyeload of having it there.\nTo run btsync, download the .tar.gz folder, and then open your Downloads folder in Nautilus (the file manager). Then right click the .tar.gz file and select \"Extract Here\". Once done extracting, open a terminal and run the command:\n~/Downloads/btsync_i386/btsync\n\nAnd btsync will run.\nCheers!\n", "Q: How to find docs for apt installed packages I'm wandering if there is a universal way to find docs for apt installed packages, or at least find out what they do. Sometimes I run into packages of which I have no idea at all, but I cannot figure out what they do either locally or online.\nFor instance, what does the package libaccounts-glib0 do? If it is for web account plugins, I'll simply remove it. If it is for core accounts services, removing it will get me into trouble, I guess. There is not even a one-line description to help me decide.\n\nA: That's one of the beauties with FOSS. There isn't a central documentation for every piece of software (that is if the documentation exists in the first place).\nNormally when looking for documentation, people rely on the man pages, info and, if the application is a GUI, the yelp help files. That's normally with applications that users can interact with/configure/use directly (the frontend). This includes the .conf files, and almost any text configuration file. Then some applications don't do this and rely on the --help switch. Ubuntu (and Debian) has a policy for software documentation, that all documentation gets dumped in /usr/share/doc/packagename:\nls -l /usr/share/doc/ | grep <package_name>\n\nSo, for the specific case of libraries, some of them includes -doc:\n\nlibetsf-io-doc - Developer documentation API and tutorials for ETSF_IO\n\nOr in the specific case of your package libaccounts-glib0:\n\nlibaccounts-glib-doc - library for single signon - documentation\n\nFor finding this documentation you have to look for the source package libaccounts-glib.\nThen, there are some packages that don't include the documentation in the repositories for legal reasons, or just don't have any.\nIn any case, for finding any documentation, you should look for the -doc of the packages, that normally are suggested (like ntp suggest ntp-doc), or look for the content of a specific packages to see if it includes some info, man or README file:\ndpkg -L <package> | grep -P '/man|info|README|doc/'\n\n", "Q: no suitable windowing system found, exiting. open office 4 ubuntu I am running open office 4 soffice headless on Ubuntu 64 bit on my VPS with command line. \n/usr/bin/soffice -accept=socket,host=localhost,port=8100;urp;StarOffice.ServiceManager -norestore -nofirststartwizard -nologo -headless\n\nIts exiting with an error. \nno suitable windowing system found, exiting.\n\n\nA: You need to install package libxt6 and libxrender1\n\napt-get install libxt6\n  apt-get install libxrender1\n\n", "Q: sudoing my own bash scripting Okay, so I have my scripts in ~/bin/, and they are added to the path normally.

If not, follow this guide to get it installed. This guide about Nvidia and multi-monitors is a bit old but should still be useful.

Example\n  installation command:\nsudo apt-get install hfsprogs\nNext, mount or remount the HFS+ drive; commands need to be as follows:\nsudo mount -t hfsplus -o force,rw /dev/sdXY /media/mntpoint\nor\nsudo mount -t hfsplus -o remount,force,rw /mount/point\n\n...\n\nFinally, if the drive was improperly unmounted or has otherwise become\n  partially corrupted run fsck.hfsplus ... as\n  such:\nsudo fsck.hfsplus -f /dev/sdXY\n\nThere is a goldmine of other information there regarding the mounting of HFS+ filesystems.\n\nA: Since I cannot comment (not enough reputation here:). I will post this answer to point out that the answer above appears to be for a hfs+ HD that is not journalled. The 'fsck.hfsplus' command needs to be issued with the '-f' option to work on a journalled volume.  To avoid confusion I've copied the command below:\n$ sudo fsck.hfsplus /dev/sdXY\n\n** /dev/sdXY\n[snip....]\n** The volume ########### appears to be OK.\n\nThis would only run on a volume that has not been journalled. Even with the '-f' option on a journalled volume this check in itself will not allow the remounted volume to be mounted read/write.  I believe journalling must be turned off.\nThere does not seem to be stable code available to turn off journalling from linux.  See the link provided by Richard: http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=1420673 \nIf journalling is turned off and the disk initially mounts as read-only unmounting and remounting should allow read/write if the disk is undamaged.  If it is damaged then fsck.hfsplus needs to be run.\n\nA: Borrowing from the previous answer, the following steps worked for me. Hopefully this is useful to others:\n\n\n*\n\n*Plug in the external HDD.\n\n*Notice that Ubuntu mounts it automatically but it is read-only.\n\n*Unmount the drive (I do this simply by clicking on the eject button in the file explorer).\n\n*sudo apt-get install hfsprogs\n\n*$ sudo fsck.hfsplus /dev/sdXY \n\n** /dev/sdXY\n** Checking HFS Plus volume.\n** Detected a case-sensitive catalog.\n** Checking Extents Overflow file.\n** Checking Catalog file.\n** Checking multi-linked files.\n** Checking Catalog hierarchy.\n** Checking Extended Attributes file.\n** Checking volume bitmap.\n** Checking volume information.\n** The volume ########### appears to be OK.\n\n(sudo fsck.hfsplus -f /dev/sdXY if filesystem is journaled.)\n\n*Remount the drive (I do this simply by clicking on the drive in the file explorer).\n\n*The drive is now read-write.\n", "Q: How can I recursively copy files without overwriting existing permissions? When I copy files from one directory to another, the directory permissions get reset (e.g: from 0755 to 0775), and this causes problems, forcing me to go back and manually reset directory permissions. I'm currently doing cp -r /source/directory /destination/directory\nI want to copy all of the files and new directories, but not overwrite permissions of existing directories. \n\nA: Add -p flag\ncp -pR /source/dir /dest/dir\n\nFrom man cp:\n-p     same as --preserve=mode,ownership,timestamps\n\n\nA: To preserve links you may use cp (manpage for cp ) with the -d flag, which is equivalent to --no-dereference --preserve=links. \nTo combine this with the -p and -R flags you can use the archive flag -a.\n\nA: My ~/.bashrc has been modified to contain \nalias cp='cp -i --preserve=all'\n\nThis means when I use cp, it will also prompt before overwriting (-i), and preserve all (i.e. mode, ownership, timestamps; and if possible additional attributes: context, links, xattr).\nYou could always change it to just mode instead of all if you like, but I do like having this alias to change the defaults of cp.\n", "Q: How to Install Ubuntu 13.04 I have bit of a problem.\nI have no idea how to install the Ubuntu 13.04.\nThe only thing I have is USB.

I found this package easy to install and working with no apparent flaws.\n\nI used ProFTPd for a long time. However on the previus Ubuntu LTS\n  (Trusty) ProFTPd was already buggy, shutting down by itself, which I\n  corrected with a script.\nOn Xenial the situation become worse, with the product stopping but\n  not shutting down. On the other end I could never setup ProFTPd for\n  passive ftp transfers and TLS never worked properly since MLSD command\n  failed with TLS authentication.\nSo, I decided to give PureFTP a try.

All the literature I can find about dual booting Windows and Ubuntu suggests that Windows be installed first, then Ubuntu, since the Ubuntu install software has an option that streamlines this whole process.\nI already installed Ubuntu and have been using it for a few months, and I don't want to just wipe everything in order to install Windows and then reinstall Ubuntu.  I am also a bit new at this, so I don't know the appropriate way to partition my drive to install Windows manually.\n\nIs there a way to dual boot Windows easily given an existing Ubuntu install?\n\nI have combed the Internet for a good guide on this topic but I haven't found anything yet that I understand.  What I am really looking for is a simple guide that doesn't involve advanced terminology or lingo (picture based, even, if possible).  I am slowly learning what all this linux terminology means, but I am still a beginner, and am nowhere near able to understand everything that I apparently have to to accomplish this task.\n\nA: I know what is your problem and I think this might partially answer your question even though I would not personally be satisfied with this resolution Dual boot - 12.04 installed first\n\nA: You need a primary partition (sda1 thru sda4) formatted NTFS with the boot flag.

It was developed to provide a small and fast IDE, which has only a few dependencies from other packages. It supports many filetypes and has some nice features.\n\nWhat this means? That Geany is first a text editor later an IDE, it won't compile a thing by itself, so you may need the libraries and headers to start compiling.\nIDE by wikipedias definition:\n\nis a software application that provides comprehensive facilities to computer programmers for software development. An IDE normally consists of a source code editor, build automation tools and a debugger. Several modern IDEs integrate with Intelli-sense coding features.\n\nSo, Geany will just allow you to see the code very pretty, saves you from going to the terminal and executing the compiler and help you to debug the code.\nFor your second question, I recommend you to got to Raspberry Pi for in deep information, but I was able to find you this:\n\n[...] all of the Linux binaries being used by Raspbian OS has been written using the C programming language.

This works perfectly fine, I use Caps Lock as Control all the time. However, when sending an Email via GMail, the shortcut Caps Lock + Return does not send the email, although Control (the good old control key) + Return does. Shouldn't Caps Lock be just another Control and thus work? Is the problem the \"but keep the Caps_Lock keysym\"?\n\nA: I think you are correct that the but keep the Caps_Lock keysym is to blame.

The tutorial you mention should work but it's far from the best practise. You shouldn't be stuffing site configuration into the conf.d area.\nHere's our documentation for managing virtualhosts. It tells you where the configuration should go (/etc/apache2/sites-available/) and how you should enable it (a2ensite). That should explain how it's all supposed to work.\n\n\n*\n\n*https://help.ubuntu.com/community/ApacheMySQLPHP#Virtual_Hosts\nThe rest of that document is pretty handy too.\n\nAnd in direct answer to your direct question (if that isn't answered by the above), yes and no. By default Apache has a /etc/apache2/sites-available/default config file (don't get hung up on the presense or lack of extension - they're all just text files) which will serve any domain (or IP) on port 80 out of /var/www/.\nIf you want specific domain handling, like multiple virtual hosts, you're going to want to add another site configuration file.\n", "Q: Universal appindicator wrapper Suffering from ditched system tray support in 13.04. :(\nIs it technically possible to create universal appindicator wrapper for arbitrary application which supports only system tray icon?

If you are new to Linux, this method might be daunting (sorry):\nI assume you deleted the sda1 partition earlier, which is why you have the unallocated space at the beginning of the disk, the high-level procedure is:\n\n\n*\n\n*re-create the sda1 partition\n\n*format the new sda1 partition as ext4\n\n*I recommend you label the new partition something like:\n\n*\n\n*e2label /dev/sda1 ssdroot1\n\n\n*mount the new sda1 partition\n\n*copy your current system to the new sda1\n\n*\n\n*To do this, I use a trick to copy a running system:\n\n\n\nAssuming your new sda1 is mounted at /mnt/sda1/:\n mkdir /bind\n mount -o bind / /bind\n cd /bind\n cp -a . /mnt/sda1/\n cd\n umount /bind\n\n\n\n*\n\n*Finally, you will need to edit the /mnt/sda1/etc/fstab to make the\nnew sda1 the / (root) partition.\n\n*\n\n*put the new UUID in place of the sda5 UUID\n\n\n\nYou can see the UUID and labels by doing:\nblkid | grep sda\n\nBefore rebooting, make note of the sda1 label or UUID.\nFor the first boot into sda1 you will need to manually override the root at the grub prompt by editing the boot parameters. Not that these edits only affect this boot, they will not be persisted to disk.\nPress 'e' to edit\nfind the linux line with root=UUID=....\nchange it to the new UUID, or remove the root=UUID=... and put in root=LABEL=ssdroot1\n(assuming you labeled your new sda1 partition)\n\nPress F10 to continue the boot, with any luck you will boot into your sda1 copy of Linux.\nCheck that you are really in your new Linux:\ndf\ncat /proc/mounts\n\nOnce into your new Linux copy, I recommend you run:\nupdate-grub\n\nNote that the Master Boot Record will still refer to your old sda5 Linux.\nIf you want to make these changes permanent, so you can remove sda5, you must update the MBR to refer to the sda1 Linux by running, from the sda1 Linux:\ngrub-install /dev/sda\n\nGood luck!\n- Greg\n\nA: I thought I would provide another option. I know you said in your title that you wanted to copy the current Linux partition and boot from it, which I addressed in my other answer, however, if all you are really trying to do is to better utilize your SSD drive, you have other options.\nYou still need to re-create and format the sda1 partition, however, you could then mount that new sda1 partition as /data (for example) and then have access to the additional storage.\nThis would be significantly easier and less complicated than my first answer, however, your Linux system would not be copied.

Click on accept button to write the changes to disk.\nP.S.will post more later.\nHow to automount a partition on startup\n1.) First you will need to create a mount point, that is, a location/folder where the mounted partition will appear.\nFor example you want the ext4 partition to appear as the folder Data in your home directory, for that you would have to create the folder using-\nsudo mkdir /home/<your user name>/Data\n\nData is the name of the folder, you could choose any like MyData or LinuxData etc\n2.)Now you need to find out the UUID of the partition you want to automount.For that,\nIn a terminal, type\nsudo blkid\n\nThis would list all your partitions and their UUIDs. From here you need to copy the UUID of your desired partition (the data partition that you have just now created).Copy it.\n3.)Now we need to make changes to /etc/fstab, so that your partition is mounted at startup automatically.\nin the terminal type-\nsudo gedit /etc/fstab\nInside this file there will be a list of partitions. Now you need to make entry for your desired  partition.\nLike this-\nUUID=5c563186-c587-4715-b9c1-7044dfa05411   /home/<your user name>/Data     ext4    defaults        0   0\n\nIn the same way create the entry as I have created, but remeber to replace my partiton partition UUID with the one that you got using the sudo blkid command, and replace your username with \nAfter this save the file and restart..and after restaring, your partition should now be mounted in your desired Directory!\nP.s.\nYou can choose any other , more convinient mount point like\n/media/Data if it suits you.

I know that touch apps will run on the desktop with the same UI, but I was wondering if it will be possible for a single Ubuntu SDK app to have a multi-window UI with desktop style UI elements when running in desktop mode, while also providing a separate touch UI when running on touch platforms.\n\nA: Changing aspects of the layout depending on the size of the window can be accomplished in a number of ways. At the most basic level, you can just set properties to different values based on the dimensions. Here is a minimal example that draws a grey square that turns orange if you make the window bigger:\nRun with qmlscene path/to/file.qml\nimport QtQuick 2.0\nimport Ubuntu.Components 0.1\n\nMainView {\n    id: root\n    width: units.gu(50)\n    height: units.gu(50)\n\n    Rectangle {\n        id: hello\n        color: parent.width > units.gu(60) ?

To help with this, the Ubuntu Toolkit provides a ConditionalLayout component where you can define different layouts that will be activated when a condition is met. This happens dynamically, and you can see the changes as you resize the window.\nHere is a more complex example using ConditionalLayout:\nimport QtQuick 2.0\nimport Ubuntu.Components 0.1\nimport Ubuntu.Components.ListItems 0.1 as ListItem\nimport Ubuntu.Layouts 0.1\n\nMainView {\n    id: root\n    width: units.gu(50)\n    height: units.gu(75)\n\n    Page {\n        anchors.fill: parent\n\n        Layouts {\n            id: layouts\n            anchors.fill: parent\n            layouts: [\n\n                ConditionalLayout {\n                    name: \"flow\"\n                    when: layouts.width > units.gu(60)\n\n                    Flow {\n                        anchors.fill: parent\n                        flow: Flow.LeftToRight\n\n                        ItemLayout {\n                            item: \"sidebar\"\n                            id: sidebar\n                            anchors {\n                                top: parent.top\n                                bottom: parent.bottom\n                            }\n                            width: parent.width / 3\n                        }\n\n                        ItemLayout {\n                            item: \"colors\"\n                            anchors {\n                                top: parent.top\n                                bottom: parent.bottom\n                                right: parent.right\n                                left: sidebar.right\n                            }\n                        }\n                    }\n                }\n            ]\n\n            Column {\n                id: sidebar\n                anchors {\n                    left: parent.left\n                    top: parent.top\n                    right: parent.right\n                }\n                Layouts.item: \"sidebar\"\n\n                ListItem.Header {\n                    text: \"Ubuntu Color Palette\"\n                }\n\n                ListItem.Standard {\n                    id: orangeBtn\n                    text: \"Ubuntu Orange\"\n                    control: Button {\n                        text: \"Click me\"\n                        onClicked: {\n                            hello.color = UbuntuColors.orange\n                        }\n                    }\n                }\n\n                ListItem.Standard {\n                    id: auberBtn\n                    text: \"Canonical Aubergine\"\n                    control: Button {\n                        text: \"Click me\"\n                        onClicked: {\n                            hello.color = UbuntuColors.lightAubergine\n                        }\n                    }\n                }\n\n                ListItem.Standard {\n                    id: grayBtn\n                    text: \"Warm Grey\"\n                    control: Button {\n                        text: \"Click me\"\n                        onClicked: {\n                            hello.color = UbuntuColors.warmGrey\n                        }\n                    }\n                }\n            } // Column\n\n            Rectangle {\n                id: hello\n                Layouts.item: \"colors\"\n                color: UbuntuColors.warmGrey\n                anchors {\n                    top: sidebar.bottom\n                    bottom: parent.bottom\n                    left: parent.left\n                    right: parent.right\n                }\n\n                Label {\n                    anchors.centerIn: parent\n                    text: \"Hello (ConditionalLayout) World!\"\n                    color: \"black\"\n                    fontSize: \"large\"\n                }\n            }\n        } // Layouts\n    } // Page\n} // Main View\n\nWhen in the default phone-like size, it looks like:\n\nWhen it is expanded to a tablet or desktop-like size, it looks like:\n\n\nA: I think that you can have this result using Conditional Layouts.\n", "Q: Remove Tamil Fonts from Ubuntu I have installed Ubuntu using wubi from windows.

When installing the OS I skipped making a swap file/partition. The machine has 8GB RAM and I wasn't sure whether I need a swap file at all. But after some reading I understood that the swap file is used in some cases even if there is free RAM still. So, it seems that I will need it. \n\n\n*\n\n*Should I create it like a file or like a partition? \n\n*Should it be on the SSD or on the HDD? \n\n*If I create it on the HDD, could it be a bottleneck for the system because of the lower read/write speeds compared to the SSD where the OS is installed? \n\n*What is the optimal size for a laptop with 8GB RAM?\n\n\nA: Yes, its recommended to create a swap partition.\nYou could make it on the HDD as it will be used very rarely.\nSize- 4GB is recommended.\nThe Swap partition can be useful also when you are booting from a live DVD, which will automatically detect your Swap partition.\nTo create the swap partition-\nLaunch Gparted partition editor.\nFrom devices, choose your hard disk.\nshrink an existing partition by 4gb.\nIn the space thats created right click, new,(options) size- 4096 mb, type- linux swap, label- Swap\nThen click on accept.\nAfter this Swap partion is created you can right click on it and select SwapOn.\nThis will activate the swap partition.\nTo automatically activate (mount) the swap partition at startup, you will have to follow the following steps-\nIn a terminal, type \nsudo blkid\n\nThis would list all your partitions and their UUIDs.\nFrom here you need to copy the UUID of your newly created swap partition.\nThen in the terminal type-\nsudo gedit /etc/fstab\n\nInside this file there will be a list of partitions.\nNow you need to make entry for your swap partition.\nLike this-\nUUID=a73fa26b-e12b-41d5-925f-58851419359a   swap                swap    sw          0   0\n\nIn the same way create the entry as I have created, but remeber to replace my Swap partition UUID with the one that you got using the sudo blkid command.\nHere is a link about Swap partiton from the Ubuntu Web Wiki\nSwapFAQ\nIf you are having any problems please let me know.\n", "Q: The same driver isn't being installed during every Ubuntu 12.04 install I have installed Ubuntu 12.04 several times, and during installation sometimes the version 304 Nvidia driver gets installed sometimes the version 173.

I've tried holding shift on multiple startups without success.\n\nA: Boot from your Ubuntu Live DVD and try this tool-\nBoot Repair\n\nA: The likely problem is that the Windows Master Boot Record (MBR) is installed on your SSD.\nYou probably need to boot into your Linux from DVD (rescue mode) or USB drive, then write the grub MBR to your SSD by doing something like:\ngrub-install /dev/sda\n\nThis assumes your SSD is named /dev/sda\n\nA: I would guess that you chose the wrong place to install grub. Try to install it in the mbr of your drive. I do not know what your bios lets you choose to boot from (drives or also partitions), but since you have only one drive it should be okay. But it should work if you should reinstall grub using a livecd.\nMaybe you could provide more information. What is the holding shift part about?

I've got a Ubuntu 13.04 desktop and I need to connect to a Sonicwall VPN appliance using NetExtender. TL,DR, the VPN connects fine, but then I can't reach any internet or LAN websites.  \nDetails: \nFirst I installed the right libraries and the most recent SUN Java (not Open JDK) using this article: \n\nHow to get Netextender (VPN) working in Ubuntu 12.10 x64? \nOnce I did that, and installed the most recent NetExtender client from the My Sonicwall website, the connection succeeds.\nIt's configured for Tunnel All mode so all traffic is supposed to go through the VPN, except that I can't reach any internet sites or LAN sites.  \nI've duplicated this problem on a second Ubuntu desktop, and I see it in 12.04 also.\nI can connect from Mac or Windows using the same account, so I don't think it's a problem with the Sonicwall policies or user account.\n\nA: Sure enough, it was a routing problem.  \nWith the connection active, I compared the routing tables between a Mac that worked and Ubuntu that did not, and sure enough the route from my public (dynamic) IP to the gateway inside the tunnel was not there.  The NetExtender logs also indicate \"Error determining existing route to ssl-vpn\"\nTo fix it, in a terminal window, do:\nsudo route add -net (your-VPNs-public-ip) netmask (your-VPNs-netmask) gw (your-tunnels-gateway) dev (your-ethernet-device)\n\nFor example, mine was something like this.  It took a few tries in my case as the connection kept dying and reconnecting - something to do with the Sonicwall thinking the connection wasn't active?:\nsudo route add -net 1.2.3.4 netmask 255.255.255.255 gw 192.168.0.1 dev wlan0\n\nGot the idea from here:  http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=2146122&highlight=netextender\n", "Q: select packages related to some program in apt archive Suppose that I have installed a program \"someProgram\".

From the description I understand it provides some \"hacks\" for the KDE window manager in combination with an Nvidia binary graphics driver.\n\nThis package contains a library used by nvidia cards for the KDE window manager.\nThis package is part of the KDE workspace module.\n\nHowever, this description lacks what it actually does. I use KDE/Kubuntu and I have the Nvidia graphics driver installed. What are the benefits of installing these packages? What do they do?\nI've got the libkwinnvidiahack4 package installed (probably automatically), but I'm not sure what it is responsible for.\nRunning through the changelogs (apt-get changelog libkwinnvidiahack4) give me the kde-workspace changelog with an entry (several snippets taken from it):\n\n  \n*\n  \n*Move libkwinnvidiahack4 to its own package\n  \n*Add the packages\n  \n  \n*\n  \n*kde-window-manager-active\n  \n*kde-window-manager-active-gles\n  \n*libkwinactiveglutils1\n  \n*libkwinactiveglesutils1\n  \n*libkwinactiveeffects1abi3\n  \n*libkwinactivenvidiahack4\n  \n  \n*kde-window-manager/-gles depends on libkwinnvidiahack4\n  \n*Don't install /usr/lib/libkwinnvidiahack.so. No one is supposed to link\n  against libkwinnvidiahack. Make kdebase-workspace-dev depend on\n  libkdecorations4 and libkwineffects1 instead of kde-window-manager now\n  that kde-window-manager contains nothing one can link against.\n\nwhich also does not explain why these packages are added and what they do.\n\nA: After a serious bit of Googling I came across this post:\n\nThe only purpose of this file is to be later in the link order than\n  (nvidia's) libGL, thus being initialized by the dynamic linker before\n  it, allowing it to set __GL_YIELD=NOTHING soon enough for libGL to\n  notice it.\n\nGiven that the quote is from a certain M-Graesslin, Martin is the chief maintainer in this area, so is a sure-fire source.\nIndeed, looking at the source-code\napt-get source libkwinnvidiahack4\n\nThis is actually the kde workspace module.\nkwin/nvidiahack.cpp is the source module in question - its a small module in itself\nSince this hack is still in 13.04 - and is part of the core build, yes its still needed and its purpose is to ensure library linking for the OpenGL component of KDE is done in the correct functional order.\nIn terms of what the module does - it looks like it defines a runtime environment variable __GL_YIELD\nFrom the freedesktop spec \n\nOpenGL yield behavior\nThere are several cases where the NVIDIA OpenGL driver needs to wait\n  for external state to change before continuing. To avoid consuming too\n  much CPU time in these cases, the driver will sometimes yield so the\n  kernel can schedule other processes to run while the driver waits. For\n  example, when waiting for free space in a command buffer, if the free\n  space has not become available after a certain number of iterations,\n  the driver will yield before it continues to loop.\nBy default, the driver calls sched_yield() to do this. However, this\n  can cause the calling process to be scheduled out for a relatively\n  long period of time if there are other, same-priority processes\n  competing for time on the CPU. One example of this is when an\n  OpenGL-based composite manager is moving and repainting a window and\n  the X server is trying to update the window as it moves, which are\n  both CPU-intensive operations.\nYou can use the __GL_YIELD environment variable to work around these\n  scheduling problems. This variable allows the user to specify what the\n  driver should do when it wants to yield.\n\nThus the hack is to never wait and always paint on the OpenGL composite surface - most probably to stop graphical artifacts from appearing.\n", "Q: Unable to edit /etc/apt/sources.list file When I try to edit my sources.list file using the command:\n$ gksu gedit /etc/apt/sources.list\n\nIt requests an administrative password and when I type the password, It says incorrect and try again.What to do? I am new to Linux and Ubuntu. \n\nA: gksu is probably set to use su instead of sudo as the authentication method. Therefore, it's asking you for the administrative (root) password.\nTo change this, run gksu-properties and choose sudo as the Authentication Method. This way, gksu will ask you for your password.\n\nYou'll notice that the dialog box that asks you for the password changes from:\n\nwhich is asking for the administrative (root) password to:\n\nwhich asks for your password to perform administrative tasks.\n\nA: Use the default terminal text editor program nano instead of gedit to edit /etc/apt/sources.list. Open the terminal and type:\nsudo nano /etc/apt/sources.list\n\nAlternatively you can also replace sudo nano /etc/apt/sources.list with sudoedit /etc/apt/sources.list. Because nano is the default terminal editor in Ubuntu the two commands do exactly the same thing.\nThe instructions for using nano are always displayed at the bottom of the page. Use the keyboard combination Ctrl + O and after that press Enter to save the file to its current location. Use the keyboard combination Ctrl + X to exit nano.\n\nA: Solving the problem:\nIf your root password is correct and you are receiving error from using gksu gedit /etc/apt/sources.list then use gksudo gedit /etc/apt/sources.list and go about the changes.\n\nA: In kde you cannot open kate with sudo, ie # sudo kate <file>.

Firefox offers the same option, and also offers to let me open the file with an app of my choosing, but only shows emacs as an option.  And kitchen-sink though it may be, by default emacs doesn't seem to do any magic with .ics files ;)\nI know that if I save it to a file, and go to https://www.google.com/calendar I can import a .ics file, but that involves a lot of frustrating steps.\nSo how can I just get a one- or two-click method of adding this to my google calendar?\nNote that if the web site offers the calendar via a \"webcal:\" protocol, it is possible to configure a protocol handler so that gets passed off to the google calendar site, as documented at Google Calendar as default handler of webcal protocol for iCal/ICS files.\n\nA: The only thing that we need to add an external calendar to Google Calendar is the address where the calendar itself resides. In this case, represented by the .ics file. Nevertheless, finding the proper address where the file is hosted may be certainly difficult, specially if it is coded in Javascript (as in this case) and not in a public URL.\nAnyway. By Diving in the code of the page you provided in the question, I found that the .ics file can be reached in this address: http://events.colorado.edu/eventexport.aspx?Eid=14255&Iid=72564&Dt=O&fmt=I&invite=False&inviteemail=\nSo if you are interested in adding the appointment of this .ics file (and may be other appointments when the file is updated), you can import the file directly by Clicking the button next to \"Other calendars\" (the one with a small triangle pointing to downside) and choose \"Add by URL\" as we can see in the next screenshot:\n\nYou will be asked for the url, let's introduce the .ics file url and hit the \"Add Calendar\".

I have \"auto raise delay\" 100 and \"focus prevention level \"Very High\"\nWhen I hover my mouse over a window that does not have the focus, but does have a scroll bar, and I move the scroll wheel on my mouse, the window scroll bar moves up and down, but the focus does not move from the focused window to the window I'm scrolling.\nThis is bad, because my brain then thinks that window has focus when it does not.  Invariably I will then begin typing, thinking my new window has focus. This can have disastrous results; I've lost folders of email this way.\nHow do I fix this crazy behavior? I want click to focus for everything, including scrolling.\n\nA: I think that the best option for your request/issue is to go in CompizConfig Settings Manager, select General Options, Focus & Raise Behaviour tab, and uncheck Click To Focus and Auto-Raise options:\n\nIf you want that the window in which you go with the mouse to scroll to come on top of the other windows, you can keep Auto-Raise checked, but in this case I suggest you to increase the value for Auto-Raise Deleay somewhere around 1000.\n", "Q: apt-get and outdated packages Why is it that many packages in apt-get are outdated? For example, I would like to get the latest implementation of the clojure programming language onto my machine. However, running the command apt-cache search clojure I get the following:\nclojure - a Lisp dialect for the JVM\nclojure-contrib - user contributed set of libraries for clojure\nclojure1.2 - Lisp dialect for the JVM\nclojure1.3 - Lisp dialect for the JVM\nleiningen - simple build system for Clojure\nlibclojure-maven-plugin-java - Clojure plugin for Maven\nlibclucy-clojure - Clojure interface to the Lucene search engine\nlibjava-jdbc-clojure - Clojure interface to sql databases via jdbc\nlibrobert-hooke-clojure - Function wrapper library for Clojure\nlibtools-logging-clojure - Logging macros for Clojure\n\nAll the clojure implementations are old (clojure is version 1.1). The newest release of the clojure programming language is 1.5.\nWhy is it that packages are not up to date? Do I need to reconfigure my apt-get program?\n\nA: According to me, apt-get has the same philosophy as the Ubuntu updater, which doesn't proceed to any OS upgrades which are not \"Long Term Support\" (except if you configure it differently).\nI think the basic sources only target \"stable\" and \"safe\" packages. When a program is updated by its provider, it is very unlikely for the new version to appear in the base repositories quickly. We have this behaviour with the LibreOffice suite : you'll get stuck on version 4.0.2.2 (as far as I remember) even if 4.0.3 has already been released. For this example, you needed to add the LibreOffice repository (ppa:libreoffice/libreoffice-4-0) in order to get a recent package. In some other cases, such as php, the name of the package changes between major versions (php became php5 or php53 on some distributions).\nThat's the same for most applications. Get the provider's PPA, or if it's not available, download the sources and compile them, it's pretty easy, given that you'll often find a INSTALL file in the source tarballs.\nSome useful commands :\nsudo add-apt-repository [ppa] # Adds a PPA to apt sources.\nsudo apt-get update # Reloads the packages list from the current apt sources.\nsudo apt-get dist-upgrade # Proceeds to packages update.\n\nTo me, this characteristic is a flaw in the apt-get conception. I agree on the fact that it provides some security to beginners (no downloads for uncertified \"safe\" applications), but for developers, or just for more advanced users, it can become quite disturbing.\n", "Q: How to install Kodak 3250 printer driver?

But I just got to know that when I tried to connect while I'm out of home, then I got the following error: ssh: Could not resolve hostname myhostname: nodename nor servname provided, or not known. It looks like the cause is two machines reside in different network here, I think. When I tried to search on the Web, I saw IP address is conflicted. However, I can't understand what it means nor I don't know it truly causes the problem here in the first place. So how can I solve for the issue here? I think it requires some sort of manual settings on the part of Ubuntu before I connect, if I interprets it correctly.\nSo how can I fix the issue? And can I connect while I'm out too? (which I believe I can, but am not completely sure...)\nThanks.\n\nA: This is not an answer, but I have more to say than fits in a comment. The beast you're trying to tame can be tamed, but it's way bigger than you're thinking, as you stand with your hand on the end of its tail. I don't know how to get you on its back, but I can describe its butt, which you haven't yet laid hands on.\nFirst things. That address you got, 127.0.0.1, that's not your address. Try this command, similar but less noise: ip -f inet a. You'll see probably two short groups. Ignore the group that says LOOPBACK 127.0.0.1. Look in the other, for a line with any other set of numbers. Look for a line that reads something like \"inet 192.168.100.1/24\". That's your address. Not the /24 part.\nTime for a pause. Who else has that address? Everybody has that address. Walk out on your balcony, put your hand on your brow, squint, count. How many other balconies do you see? Behind every single one of them is another computer with that same address. Every single apartment. Except that guy on the bottom floor, polishing his Harley on his patio. He has that address and two others.\nLike most folks, you probably have a WiFi router that sets up a little internet fiefdom for your private amusement. It's from there that your inet address comes from, and it works only within your private fiefdom. Just like Harley and everybody else. The whole internet is broken up into cells this way.\nWhat you want, you want a global presence so you, and anybody in Latvia, can find your home server from anywhere in the world. That takes more work than plugging in a WiFi router. There are several approaches. A service like managed DNS is probably your most attractive option. No-ip for example offer a free service geared toward home users. That's not your next step.\nI hesitate to recommend a service, but there it is. I hesitate, because you're about to get kicked, reaching for the butt. Kicked hard. The 'net is lousy with bad guys who are always probing for fresh new virgin computers to stand up and peek outside their little fiefdoms, ready for a good beating. You opened up port 22 to the world. That's the red neon light port. Put your computer on the global net that way, and you will be probed and discovered.\nI had the neatest experience back in the '90s. For a time there, there was a known exploit that allowed Windows XP to be hijacked without doing anything at all. You didn't have to run a program or browse a website. Just jack your box in to the net. The funny thing was, base XP was vulnerable, but SP3 was not, if I recall correctly. But the CD was base, and you installed SP3 from the 'net. Yeah. I installed base XP, jacked in to upgrade to SP3, and in minutes I was infected. Fantastic.\nIt's usually not that bad, and Linux is safer than that, for all we know. But you opened port 22 to the world. No one ever does that. Do you have a good, strong, user password? A really good, strong password? Do you have a root account? Have you disabled root login over SSH? Have you disabled ssh password authentication altogether, opting for public key login? What services do you have running? Have you cut them back to a minimal set? Do you have active SELinux/AppArmor profiles for them?\nHonestly you're probably still safe enough, because your WiFi router surely has a firewall that prevents SSH attempts from outside, and just protected you from yourself. Don't disable that just yet. I'm not expert on this stuff by any means. This is just the basics. Stricter Defaults on help.ubuntu.com might be a good introduction to this topic, but you'll want to read and understand more than that, before contacting No-ip.\n", "Q: VirtualHost In Localhost Is Not Accessible From Localhost When Offline, How To Fix It? I am setting up my own local development web server, mainly for theme development.\nI've successfully setup LAMP in Ubuntu 13.04 64bit Desktop, apache works fine. \nThe machine where LAMP is installed is also my deskstop station. \nSo I want to access the VirtualHost both from the localhost itself and from another machine within my lan. \nI've setup my first virtual host named devone.loc\nI've already inserted the name inside my hosts file. \nEverything is working and accessible. \nIt's also accessible within any machines in my lan, I have setup it up in DNSmasq in my DD-WRT router.\nBut then, when I disable my network connection, the virtual host is \nno longer accessible. But the default virtual host is still accessible without network.\nWhat seems to be the problem here? I also need to access the virtual host within the localhost since it's also my desktop station.\nI've attached my virtual host conf file below:\n  <VirtualHost *:80>\n    DocumentRoot /var/www2\n    ServerName devone.loc\n    ServerAlias www.devone.loc\n    <Directory /var/www2>\n    Options Indexes FollowSymLinks MultiViews\n    AllowOverride None\n    Order allow,deny\n    Allow from all\n    </Directory>\n  </VirtualHost>\n\n\nYou can easily recreate my problem, when you're a virtualhost user.

I'ts only reachable/accessible when network is enabled.\nUpdate - I got it FIXED\nThis issue is actually connected to Firefox Settings, changing the setting did fixed my problem. \nnetwork.dns.disableIPv6 is the Firefox's preference name that I changed it's boolean value to false\nSo, what I did:\n\n\n*\n\n*Opened up Firefox and typed in about:config in the address bar.\n\n*I got prompted with a warning... This might void your warranty, I clicked I'll be careful, I promise!\n\n*In the search bar just below the tabs, I searched for network.dns.disableIPv6, and when It appeared, I just double clicked it to change it's value to false.\n\n*I rebooted my machine and browse to my project's site, and bam! Finally opened up.\n\nFor newbies like me, hope this will help you out. \nI can now sleep peacefully... thanks to this post. \nI had sleepless nights searching about this issue, different search strings and phrases yields different search results.

I have enough space on my hard drive for Ubuntu, but I have four primary partitions already factory made in my computer. This means something has to give and being fairly new, I don't know all of the details of what each of the drives do and I don't want to mess things up. I don't even know if I can actually do any these things, but I am wondering if I can:\n\n*\n\n*Delete one of my existing partitions (putting it in a DVD in case I need the recovery tools)\n\n*Change one of the partitions to be an extended partition\n\n*Any other option that will allow me to keep Windows and the recovery tools\n\nMy laptop is a Toshiba Satellite C650D-02Q\nThe partitions are\n[unnamed] 1.46 GB\n[C:] 396.40 GB (i shrank it to make room for the partition i cant make)\n39.06 unallocated\n[unnamed] 18.15 GB (my best guess as to what is is, is recovery tools)\n[unnamed] 10.68 GB (again don't really know what this one is)\nI am really looking for any solution that will allow me to safely dual boot W7 and Ubuntu.\n\nA: I had the same problem with my laptop when it was new, I copied the data from one of the smaller recovery partitions ( preferrably the manufactures recovery which has all their bloat wear and what not on it,) copy it in to Windows and delete the partition then recreate an extended partition using the remaining space and create your desired partitions to run Ubuntu.\n", "Q: Why are all hard drives slow on my Ubuntu system? On my computer, which dual-boots Ubuntu 12.04 LTS (kernel 3.5) and Windows 7, the hard drive speed is very fast on Windows but very slow on Ubuntu. The slowness remains when I boot on an Ubuntu Live CD for 13.04 (kernel 3.8) and prerelease 13.10 (kernel 3.11). However, when I boot on Knoppix (kernel 3.9), the slowness goes away!\nAnybody know why, or how it can be fixed in Ubuntu?\nHere are the speeds using exactly the same hardware:\n\n\n*\n\n*Ubuntu 12.04 LTS, 13.04, 13.10: About 1 MB/sec, estimated using /bin/du while copying files.\n\n*Windows 7: 168 MB/second as reported by Windows\n\n*Knoppix: about the same as Windows, definitely over 100MB/sec\n\n\nThe slowness happens on both internal and external drives: the internal SSD RAID (3ware 9750-4i card), an internal Western Digital Red (not on the RAID card), and external drives using USB 3.0, Firewire, and eSATA.\nThis computer itself has a very fast 6-core CPU and 32 GB RAM, so computer power is not an issue. It's a brand new computer so it's possible something is configured wrong.\nTrivia: Originally, I thought the problem was limited to USB 3.0, and my vendor (endpcnoise.com) guessed that the ASmedia chipset on my computer is the culprit, because Ubuntu's support for it is \"rudimentary at best.\"\nSome timing info: it takes 15 seconds to copy a 20 MB file to/from ANY DISK in the system. Here's the SSD RAID on Ubuntu 13.04 Live CD:\n$ time cp bigfile bigfile2\n\nreal    0m14.866s\nuser    0m0.000s\nsys     0m0.056s\n\nWhen I boot into Knoppix,the problem completely goes away:\n$ time cp bigfile bigfile2\nreal    0m0.034s\nuser    0m0.000s\nsys     0m0.013s\n\nWhen I run dmesg /var/log/syslog before and after a copy like this, no additional messages get written.

If I delete files from a folder synchronized with Ubuntu One, or they get deleted by some problem on the machine, how can I recover them?\n\nA: Whenever you delete files using the file browsers in Ubuntu, Windows or MacOSX, those files will be moved to the trash folder. So, the first place to look is the trash folder of your current machine.\nWhen one machine receives the message that some files where deleted in another, it will also move the files to its trash. So if you have emptied the trash or for some reason the files are not there, you can look on the trash folder of other synchronized machines.\nFinally, if you have looked on the trash of all your devices and didn't find the files, you can contact the Ubuntu One support team telling the path of the folder you need to recover. There is a limited capability of what can be recovered from the server, so there might be cases where some files can't be restored. And only the latest version of the files are stored on the Ubuntu One servers, so it's not possible to restore an old version of a file.\nThere is an open wishlist bug to add a trash to the Ubuntu One website: https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntuone-servers/+bug/377905\n", "Q: Ubuntu 13.04 won't boot after new AMD catalyst center I am far from an experienced linux user.

I was wondering if there was some way that I could fix it so I could have a better connection... any help would be greatly appreciated\n\nA: Some things to consider.\nThe connection could \"appear\" to be worse due to the way the icon displays your connection. You might want to check your actual ping response times and your connection rate to see if it is in fact worse. Open a terminal and issue command\niwconfig\n\nand look for bitrate, and command \nping -c 4 192.168.1.1\n\n(or whatever your router IP address is) and check your response times (you will probably want something in the neighborhood of 5ms or less over wireless). Is it running slowly for you?\nIf it is, Ubuntu may be using a generic driver where there is a better driver provided by the wireless chip manufacturer. That is something you might want to determine from the system specs of your particular model computer.\nMore information concerning your PC's model name/number and your actual connection rates might help pin down a better answer.\n\nA: I had the same problem with one of my friend's toshiba satallite with Atheros wireless device.Some wifi drivers for ubuntu 13.04 manages a power management scheme.

What's the most robust way to parse a source package's debian/changelog file (or debian/control?) to get the package's version number?  Something like:\npkgver=$(dpkg-parsechangelog | magic_goes_here)\n\nI want to extract the version number (and only the version number) so that I can manipulate it in a script.\nI was expecting to find a dpkg-* utility for this purpose, but I haven't found one yet.\n\nA: There are numerous ways to do this.\ndpkg-parsechangelog | sed -n 's/^Version: //p'\nor alternatively:\ndpkg-parsechangelog | grep Version: | cut -d' ' -f2-\n\nA: If you have version 1.17.0 or later, you can use\ndpkg-parsechangelog --show-field Version\n\nNo need to process the output further then. This version is currently (February 2014) available in Debian Testing.\n\nA: dpkg-parsechangelog works, and the earlier answer piping the output through sed/grep should be entirely robust. If you want to know precise details of the format of dpkg-parsechangelog output, and most other debian-style control files, see RFC 822. It is never ok for a deb package version to contain a newline, space, or any other special or control characters (see man deb-version), so the \"Version: blah\" line in the output will always be present, and it will always be a single line on its own.\nHowever, dpkg-parsechangelog is a very heavy program to run just to get the current version number from a changelog. It has to run Perl and load an impressively large number of libraries in order to give you a result, most of which you won't use. On slower platforms, or with slow file storage media, or when you need to do this version parsing lots of times, it will prove quite painfully slow. Instead, just use whatever is inside the first set of parentheses on the first line:\nhead -1 debian/changelog | awk -F'[()]' '{print $2}'\n\nThat will get you the correct current package version with any valid changelog file using the standard format (and nonstandard debian/changelog formats are, for all practical general purposes, never used).\n\nA: as I have seen package version consists at header part of the changelog file. so you can do it like \npkgver=$(dpkg-parsechangelog | head\n\nI have tried this command for installed packages, for example \naptitude changelog shutter | head\n\n& \njai@frank-Jai:~$ aptitude changelog shutter | head\nGet: Changelog of shutter\nshutter (0.89.0-0ubuntu1) quantal; urgency=low\n\n  * New upstream release.\n   - Adds an AppIndicator (LP: #805464).\n  * debian/control: Recommend libgtk2-appindicator-perl\n\n -- Andrew Starr-Bochicchio <a.starr.b@gmail.com>  Sat, 11 Aug 2012 17:36:18 -0400\n\nshutter (0.88.3-1) unstable; urgency=low\njai@frank-Jai:~$ \n\n", "Q: Skype [4.2.0.11] - black Video on KDE - 13.04 32bit I have this strange issue with skype:\n\n\n*\n\n*using Unity and other DE ( lxde/E17 ) everything works fine\n\n*using KDE/BE::Shell I have black screen in the video/webcam box ( also in option in video tab)\n\n\nI suspect that the issue is caused by some missing library to be loaded so I have tried this fix but without any success:\n\n\n*\n\n*LD_PRELOAD=/usr/lib/i386-linux-gnu/libv4l/v4l1compat.so /usr/bin/skype &\nI'm on Ubuntu 13.04 32bit and skype version is  4.2.0.11\nUPDATE:\nI have just tried the dynamic package and I have the same issue with it, now I'm confused about what could be the cause QT ? or some other LIBS ?\n\nA: What worked for me is adding:\n<VideoRenderer>\n  <DisableXv>1</DisableXv>\n  <ForceOpenGL>1</ForceOpenGL>\n</VideoRenderer>\n\nto the UI section of the file ~/.Skype/[username]/config.xml.\n", "Q: changing mouse acceleration and speed xinput How do I disable mouse acceleration and still get my mouse to go fast? The settings in the menu are too slow and don't disable the acceleration fully. I've tried doing xinput set-prop '11' 'Device Accel Profile' -1 and xinput set-prop '11' 'Device Accel Constant Deceleration' 1/5.\nAlthough it gets rid of the acceleration the mouse moves very slow now. Even xset m 2 0 doesn't change anything after I enter the xinput codes.\nHow can I increase mouse speed while getting rid of mouse acceleration?\nI'm using Ubuntu 12.04 LTS.\n\nA: The way to set it is in terminal not xset m.\nFirst, use xinput --list --short and write down your mouse ID. Mine is (8). Save it.\nNext, in the terminal, type:\nxinput --list-props yourMouseId\n\nPress enter and find the Device Accel Constant Deceleration #. Mine is (270). Write it down, behind your mouses ID.\nNow, in the terminal, type:\nxinput --set-prop 8 270 7\n\nIf this is too slow, retype the command but lower the last #. Try 6 or 5 or 4 and down till you got the speed you like.\nOne last thing: If your mouse is too slow, try going into the settings of mouse and touchpad and use the speed slider there to your liking.\n\nA: Device Accel Constant Deceleration can't be set lower than 1.0, so it sets it to 1.0 when you try setting it to 1/5. You can check this using xinput list-props 11. (I'm actually guessing it doesn't read the \"/5\"-part, because I get an error message when trying to set it to for example 0.5, but setting it to 1/5 actually sets it to 1.0).\nIf you don't want acceleration (which I completely agree with), the only thing you can do to improve the pointer speed is to set Device Accel Constant Deceleration to 1.0. If the pointer doesn't move fast enough for you then, I think the only fix is to get a mouse with higher DPI (or set your mouse to a higher DPI if you have a mouse with adjustable DPI).\n\nA: On my ubuntu 14.04 system, I seem to be able to accomplish scaling of the mouse\nsensitivity by adjusting 'Device Accel Constant Deceleration'.\nIt doesn't accept a numerator/denominator (if you try to give it one,\nit just takes the numerator), but it does accept numbers less than 1 (the lower the number, the faster your pointer will go w.r.t. how fast you move the mouse).\nSo, try using .2 instead of 1/5.  xinput --list-props 11  should then show it as .200000.\n", "Q: How do I fully expand the window showing the running operating system inside VirtualBox?

I am trying to remotely edit sshd_config file using WinSCP and putty. Unfortunately, I keep getting the following error-\n“Cannot overwrite remote file Press delete to delete the file and create a new one”. \nI tried deleting, but I got a similar error. I also tried changing the permissions on the file, but I got the error - \ncannot change properties of file sshd_config. \nI suspect I don't have the correct permissions, but I'm not sure what to do. I've attached a pic of my permissions below. \n\nQUESTION\nWhat do I need to do to be able to overwrite sshd_config ? Is it to do with my current permissions?\n\nA: Editing config files on Windows and transfering them back to Linux is dangerous because Windows uses different line breaks than Linux.\nYou should rather edit the file directly on the remote machine by typing sudo nano /etc/ssh/sshd_config make your changes and press CTRL+O to save and CTRL+X to exit. This way you also don't have to care about permissions cause you are already root.\n\nA: The answer actually turned out to be pretty obvious. I'm new to linux, so I was confused. When I logged into the server using the username and pw that I used to install the server, I was under the misunderstanding that this was the same as being root.\nAnyway, I didn't have the correct permissions to edit the file, so to fix it I used Putty to ssh into the server then I created a new group called editors with the following code\nsudo addgroup editors \n\nthen I added my user to that group\nsudo adduser myusername editors\n\nNext I gave the group editors ownership of the directory\nsudo chown :editors /etc/ssh/\n\nNext I changed the file permissions such that the group could write to the folder\nsudo chmod 770 /etc/ssh\n\nAfter logging back into the server again with WinSCP I was able to edit the files in the directory.\nThis may not be the recommended way of going about this- if it isn't I'd appreciate someone letting me know :)\n", "Q: How can I remove Ubuntu 13.04 while keeping the existing Windows 7 intact?

I want to remove it and keep my Windows OS intact in the process.\n\nA: One of the ways to do this is to burn ubunut 13.04 to an USB stick, boot from it, reinstall Ubuntu. You can overwrite the old one in the process: it should be one of the options given to you while installing. Somewhere in the installation grub will be installed and grub will autodetect Windows 7.

So I wanted to know the type of files that can be packaged into the bundle.\nAlso wanted to know what languages are the applications published in the Ubuntu Software Center are made of?\nI am trying to use Windows 7 and Qt the IDE to develop applications for Ubuntu Software Center. Is this possible , i.e If I develop an application on Windows 7 platform will they run in Ubuntu? or should I have to use Ubuntu only?\n\nA: What can an Ubuntu package contain?\nThere are no restrictions on what type of file can be included in an Ubuntu package.\nThere are some files you will have to include--files that describe the contents of the package and are often created by whatever utility you use to make the package. But there is no prohibition, technical or otherwise, on what types of files you can include.\nWhat languages can be used to write programs that can be packaged for Ubuntu?\nThere aren't any restrictions on what programming language you can use, unless you're in the rare situation where you want to use some programming language such that:\n\n*\n\n*it is a compiled language and there is no compiler that produces executables for GNU/Linux. (There are actually some workarounds, even for this problem.)\n\n*it is an interpreted language and there is no interpreter for GNU/Linux, or the only interpreter is proprietary and you're not allowed to distribute it and your users don't already have it.\n\nThose are not very common circumstances. I doubt they apply to your situation. To the best of my knowledge, every programming language that can be used to produce Qt applications (more precisely: for which Qt bindings exist1) is compatible with Ubuntu.2 In particular, the most common programming languages used with Qt are probably C++ and Python, and they are both very well supported on Ubuntu. There are many Ubuntu applications written in those languages.\nOf course, programs written for Windows will not (usually) automatically work on Ubuntu. Typically, and especially for languages that compile to native code (such as C++), you have to recompile the program with GNU/Linux as the target. It is also often necessary to deliberately write your program in such a way as to produce the desired behavior on each operating system you intend to support (see below for details). But you can use almost any language you want to do it.\n1 There are Qt bindings for many languages (some are listed here), and some languages have the ability to use libraries written for some other languages. So it's possible that someone might write a Qt program in pure X, where X is some programming language that cannot be used to make Ubuntu programs. However, as far as I know, every language that a Qt developer would likely consider using can be used to create Ubuntu programs. Of course, you might choose to use multiple languages for the same program, and if that is the case, not all of them would have to interface with the Qt libraries, and some of might have no compiler/interpreter for Ubuntu. This is not a common situation.\n2 A possible candidate for a language that has Qt bindings but cannot be used to produce programs that run on Ubuntu is C++/CLI, if you needed to produce an executable that contains both managed and unmanaged code. (This would also apply to the old language Managed C++.) C++/CLI has Qt bindings in the sense that there are .NET bindings for Qt; also, Qt supports native C++ directly. So either interface could be used. Note that C++/CLI is very different from ordinary C++, which is fully supported. Furthermore, you could write a program in C++/CLI that runs in Ubuntu, so long as you did not need to produced unmanaged code. Unsafe code, which is not the same as unmanaged code, could still work.\nWhat languages are programs, available through the Software Center, written in?\nThere are many. C, C++, Python (both version 2 and version 3), Java, C#, and Perl come to mind as common. But Ubuntu can--and does--run programs written in Objective C, Ruby, Tcl, Lua, Visual Basic .NET, D, Fortran, Golang, Ada, sh, JavaScript, PHP, Haskell, Lisp, Scheme, F#, and many others. You could write your program--or any parts of it--in some architecture's assembly language, if you wanted to.\nIn particular, since you're using Qt: an application with an interface written in QML (for Qt Declarative) can be written for Ubuntu, Windows, and many other platforms. (But you don't have to design your user interfaces declaratively for them to be multiplatform.)\nCan Qt Creator on Windows be used to develop applications for Ubuntu?\nYes. You can use Qt Creator and other similar design tools on Windows to make Ubuntu applications. Qt Creator also exists on Ubuntu, where it is fully supported. (You might want to download it from the same site where you got it for Windows, if you want to use the very latest version. Otherwise, just install the qtcreator package.)\nWriting code and creating graphical interfaces for cross-platform Qt applications is pretty easy on Windows. (It's also pretty easy on Ubuntu and a variety of other OSes.)\nCompiling Your Programs\nCross-compiling for Ubuntu on Windows is definitely possible, but if you haven't compiled a lot of software for a variety of platforms, you might find it easier to use an Ubuntu system to build the Ubuntu versions of your software.\nIf you do decide you want to try to cross-compile, you can install or build a cross-compiler in Cygwin, among other ways. (Note that Cygwin's compiler does not produce Linux executables by default, and Cygwin will not run GNU/Linux executables.)\nHow to actually build your cross-compiler that runs on Windows and produces executables for GNU/Linux is a topic unto itself and beyond the scope of this answer (probably off-topic for Ask Ubuntu even). But this may help.\nTo test your software for Ubuntu, you really do need Ubuntu (as Nanne has mentioned). So you should have an Ubuntu system. It can be a virtual machine. You can use VirtualBox on Windows; VMware is also available, though if you use a free-of-charge VMware product you should make sure to check the license terms carefully to make sure you can use it for commercial use (assuming you consider your software development activities to be commercial).\nI'm guessing your intention is to develop cross-platform software, with versions for different platforms. In particular, I am guessing that you are creating a version for Windows and another for Ubuntu (and perhaps others for other platforms).\nWhen you're developing for multiple platforms, it makes sense to choose a single platform for most of your development work. However, if your intention is to develop programs that just run on Ubuntu, then there is probably not much benefit associated with developing on some other OS like Windows.\n\"If I develop an application on Windows 7 platform will they run in Ubuntu?\"\nYou can develop applications on Windows 7 and make them run on Ubuntu. Applications you develop on Windows will not automatically run on Ubuntu.\nThey won't automatically run on Windows either--we all have the experience of writing code that doesn't work for one reason or another. However, the important points here are that:\n1. An executable that runs on Windows does not run on Ubuntu.\nThere is an emulation layer called Wine that sometimes makes this possible. It's handy for users, but you almost never want to rely on that when developing a program that you intend to run well on Ubuntu. Instead, you need to compile your program separately for each separate platform on which you intend it to run.\nYou might be able to make the same executable run on Fedora and Ubuntu, and maybe even on FreeBSD and Ubuntu (since FreeBSD can run GNU/Linux programs most of the time), but you should not attempt to make the same executable run on Windows and Ubuntu if you are compiling your programs to native code for real, physical hardware.\nWhat do I mean by \"native code for real, physical hardware\"? Well, if you create a program for the Java Virtual Machine (which includes almost any program written in Java), or the .NET Common Language Runtime (which includes almost any program written in C# or another .NET language), then your executable actually consists of bytecode that is specific to the JavaVM or the CLR rather than to the underlying computer and the operating system running on it. So for Java and .NET programs, you usually can make a single executable that will run on both Windows and Ubuntu.\nSimilarly, if you write your program in an interpreted language like Python, then you can create code that will run on both Ubuntu and Windows (provided that the interpreter is installed). In practice, most of the time a Windows application will include the interpreter it needs, and an Ubuntu application will declare a dependency on the packages that provide the interpreter. So in practice Windows and Ubuntu programs written in interpreted languages are usually prepared separately for each platform.\n2. Sometimes all it takes to make a program run on multiple platforms is to compile it separately for each one. But often, more work is necessary.\nThere are differences between the way different operating systems work. The Qt framework, and the standard library of whatever language you choose to use, will provide facilities that usually make most of a program cross-platform automatically. But sometimes you may have to use underlying operating system facilities, either to accomplish something that cannot be done with your standard library or Qt, or if you want to take advantage of OS-specific features.\nThis doesn't keep you from writing a cross-platform program. It just makes it so that some parts of your program might have to be specialized per-platform. That is, occasionally you may need to implement a feature of your program one way for one operating system, and another way for another operating system. When you compile your program for each platform separately, you can select which OS-specific parts to use. You can also often set things up so that the appropriate code is selected automatically for whatever target you're building.\nFinally, some packaging concepts and resources.\nYou're asking about what kinds of restrictions and capabilities you have when packaging software for Ubuntu, so I'd like to provide some information about that, to illustrate the different options you have and how they relate to each other.\nWhen distributing software for Ubuntu in executable form, it's encouraged and recommended to distribute .deb package files. (If you're just distributing source code, which your users have to compile, then you can put it in a .deb package, but there is usually no strong reason to do so.)\n.deb on Ubuntu (and some other operating systems such as Debian) is like .msi on Windows or .pkg on OS X. OSes that use .deb packages contain a tool called dpkg which is used to extract, install, uninstall, and keep track of installed packages.\ndpkg can be run manually by the user. But most often it is not, because there is a whole infrastructure built up on it, to further automate installing, removing, and upgrading software. APT facilitates automatically fetching .deb packages over the Internet. There are a number of other programs and services that work with and alongside APT to provide further package management functionality in Ubuntu. Two commonly used utilities are the Software Updater (called the Update Manager in earlier versions of Ubuntu) and the Software Center.\nThe Software Center provides a user-friendly way to browse for packages. It also provides a system for purchasing paid software. One way to distribute paid or gratis applications to Ubuntu users is to use this system (this site explains how, see the section on publishing).\nI'm guessing, from the wording of your question, that this is what you're interested in doing. This may be exactly what you want. However, you should be aware of alternatives. Whether you want your software to be free and open source or proprietary, there are multiple ways to distribute it to Ubuntu users:\n\n*\n\n*You can submit it directly to the Software Center. It will be reviewed; it may be rejected, but most software that works is accepted. If you want to charge money for your software, and you want users to be able to buy it in the Software Center, then you should do this. If you don't want to charge money, you might also choose to do this.\n\n\n*You can distribute your software from a Launchpad PPA. If it is free open source software, you don't have to pay anything for this, and your software is not subject to review. It will appear in search results in the Software Center, but Ubuntu users can install it easily and it will be updated together with the other software in their system (when you create updates for it).\nIf you publish your program to the Software Center as described above, this also involves the use of a PPA, but your software is subject to review and is allowed to be proprietary.\n\n\n*You can create you own .deb package files, and distribute them yourself. Then your program is not subject to review, and may be proprietary, and you may even charge for it. This is like distributing anything else yourself. It does not, generally speaking, involve any contractual relationship between you and anybody besides your users/customers and your hosting provider. (Of course, you must still follow the licenses of any software you use, and you can only legally include software in your program whose license allows it. By the way, I am not a laywer and this is not legal advice.)\n\n\n*You can distribute the source code of your program, for users to compile themselves. Then your program is not subject to review, no contractual relationship between you and anybody besides your hosting provider and your customers is typically involved, and if you have a hosting provider that allows it, your program can even be proprietary.\nHowever, most authors of proprietary software prefer to keep their source code secret, so if you are creating proprietary software, this option might not be acceptable to you. (\"Source code available\" and \"open source\" don't mean the same thing, but most closed-source software also keeps its source code unpublished.)\nHowever your software is licensed, one disadvantage of only providing it in source form is that users have to compile it themselves, so they may encounter difficulties, and less technical users may be reluctant to attempt installing the software.\n\n\n*If your program is free open source software, you can submit it for inclusion in Debian. It will then appear in subsequent versions of Ubuntu as well, because of the way Ubuntu is based on Debian. Usually you would do this after distributing it in some other way first.\n\n\n*Sometimes a package can be submitted for inclusion in Ubuntu even if it wasn't in Debian. See the Ubuntu Packaging Guide.\nSince the Ubuntu Packaging Guide provides a wealth of information related to almost any technique of distributing software to Ubuntu users, I strongly recommend taking a look at it regardless of how you plan to distribute your software.\n\n\n*You can make your own binary installer for your program, sort of like .exe installers in Windows. This is somewhat discouraged (though still popular and effective) in Windows, and it only rarely your best option in Ubuntu. But it is an option, and there is some very successful software (like MATLAB) that is \"packaged\" this way for GNU/Linux systems.\n", "Q: LibreOffice 4.1 Start Center does not show in Lubuntu I have recently upgraded libreOffice to 4.1.

Worked quite fast and nice, but there were problems with mentioned above fractals and crushing plasma. \nI switched to XRender then, and it seem to be fine so far. Few effects not working though, but most of them do. The only drawback is that GTK apps run little slow (these do run fast under OpenGL).\nAnother issue was KWin and plasma-desktop eating CPU, but that was resolved by removing  \"System monitor\" widget.\nThanks for updating your post, I will try roll back to 3.8/13.4 too, when I need OpenGL.\n", "Q: usb wifi is blocked by the hardware wifi switch I have a dell xps m1530 laptop, and it's a little dated, the physical wifi switch is broken, can not be switched on, so I bought a usb wifi dongle, but it didn't work, the network-manager detected that both the internal and usb wifi is switch off by the hardware switch, but it worked perfectly under windows, so I wonder how to bypass the hardware switch when using the usb wifi.\n\nA: I had a very similar issue with an old Sony Vaio.

It is not automatically linked to along with the rest of the standard C library.\nIf you are compiling on the command-line with the gcc or g++ command, you would accomplish this by putting -lm at the end of the command.\nFor example: gcc -o foo foo.c -lm\n", "Q: Ubuntu 12.04 LTS suspension and hibernation do not work (possibly solved for the hibernation,0 size of swap partition) I have had a problem with suspending my computer, since I installed Ubuntu 12.04 LTS a month ago, dual boot with a Windows 7 system.The \"suspend\" function does not work.Whenever I suspend my system and then turn it on again, it just starts from the beginning, as if I had not suspended it, but shut it down.  \nNo open programs or documents are resumed where I left it.The same goes for hibernating my Windows 7 system, which behaves as if it underwent a forced shutdown, whenever I try to resume from hibernating.  \nSince both systems have this problem, I think the latter lies in GRUB.When I installed Ubuntu, I was kept too long on the installation screen after it was complete and, thinking it had frozen, I forced it to shutdown to start the new system. However, apparently the installation was not completely done, as I got a GRUB error after that, being unable to boot any system. I fixed it by running a GRUB fixing program through the Ubuntu Live CD, the name of which I cannot recall.Perhaps that program did not solve all the problems.  \nI have no further problems with Ubuntu so far. I had a Linux Mint installation before that,instead of Ubuntu, with no such problem.Can you suggest a way to fix this?\n\nA: To hibernate a linux system your swap area must be able to hold up all of your ram (or what's in it), check that in the first place. On windows it's similar but you need disk space. Although it may also be some hardware issue but it's really hard to tell with amount of data you have provided.

I know it will give 6 usable floating ip but how can i know the what number other than 29 can I use to give me more range for my floating ip?\n\nA: The /number is a bit-mask where 0 means every single IP and /32 means just one (I don't think it's ever described with a /32, that's just implicit).\nOf course this scales out for IPv6 but let's leave this at IPv4 for the moment ;)\n/32 = 1 IP address. Outright.\n/31 = NaN\n/30 = 4 addresses, 2 usable\n/29 = 8 addresses, 6 usable\n/28 = 16 addresses, 14 usable\n/27 = 32 addresses, 30 usable\n/26 = 64 addresses, 62 usable\n/25 = 128 addresses, 126 usable\n/24 = 256 addresses, 254 usable (as we all know)\n\nThis carries on for larger and larger subnets.\n\nA: IPv4 address is 32-bits in length. The dotted-decimal notation is the most common representation, as it makes connection between host address and subnet address more apparent, at least when using 8, 16 or 32 bit masks. The machine sees the address (as with all other data) as a string of bits. The dotted-decimal notation divides the 32-bit string into 4 parts, each being 8 bit long - in binary 8 bits may represent decimal numbers ranging from 0 to 255 so 255 is the maximum number for each field in the IP address.\nAnyways, each address comprises of network part and host part (i.e. the network address is first N bits of the full address). The network part is often calculated from the full address by applying a netmask - you may just cut N first bits from the full address and you will get the network address. This is the number you asked about.\n32 - N bits calculation yields the host space (you have to subtract 2 from that number - the network address and broadcast address). So 32 - 29 is 3, 3 ones in binary makes 8 in decimal. By subtracting 2 you get 6, which is the number of usable IP addresses.\nIt's good to know the algorithm, but making those calculations 'manually' is not practical - there are many subnet calculators available in the 'net, e.g. http://www.subnet-calculator.com/ Much data on the topic is available at various Wikipedia pages.\n", "Q: why i couldn't connect to internet using ZTE made reliance in HSD mode?

Everyone here is assuming that I somehow want to reinvent my own interface to iptables, or make some kind of firewall application, when really, I'm just creating a simple ui for ufw that fits into my current application. However, the current state of the ufw python code base makes this a lot harder than it needs to be.\n\nA: This illustrated tutorial has the answers to the three bulleted points in your question, but it doesn't answer the part of your question about about documentation for any of the Python code. Below is a screenshot of the gufw application from the default Ubuntu repositories that shows how easy it is to get the currently set rules in gufw. Gufw is a graphical front-end to ufw which is itself a front-end to iptables.\n\nIf you really want to get down to the code level with ufw, then you're ready to consider using iptables in order to get exactly what firewall rules you want by running commands in the terminal. \n\nA: Here is a pretty comprehensive guide on iptables -- the backend of UFW:\nhttp://www.frozentux.net/documents/iptables-tutorial/\nAlso, a short tutorial on UFW:\nhttps://help.ubuntu.com/community/UFW\n", "Q: How can I use the value from a pipe in the test program? wc -l | test -eq 1\n\nThis doesn't work. I want to compare the result of wc with the value of 1. How can I do that?\n\nA: The simplest way is probably to use xargs:\nwc -l | xargs -I % test % -eq 1\n\n\nA: If you are using Bash, you probably want to research the PIPESTATUS variable. As noted in the Bash reference guide, PIPESTATUS is\n\nAn array variable (see Arrays) containing a list of exit status values from the processes in the most-recently-executed foreground pipeline (which may contain only a single command).\n\nWe can find out what the exit codes were for this pipeline with PIPESTATUS:\ndmesg | grep -iw 'nnse' | wc -l\n\nIf you now query the array variable, you get the exit statuses referring to the commands used in the pipeline:\necho ${PIPESTATUS[@]}\n0 1 0\n\n(In an indexed array, those exit codes above are represented by 0 1 and 2 in the array as arrays always start at 0 in Bash.)\nHere we see the second command returned 1, and the rest 0; however, wc -l returns 0 if there are zero matches, which is not an error. Failure is represented with a non-zero value, and there are other error values such as 127 which is command not found, and yet more codes which may be specific to the program concerned.\nIf you want to see what a particular command's exit code in the pipeline was, you can just access that value. The grep command was the second command in the pipeline above, but as arrays start from 0, we need entry one. \nSo to find out the grep command's exit code, run the above pipeline again (as the content of PIPESTATUS will have been exhausted if you have run echo ${PIPESTATUS[@]}) and then execute the command below, which will return 1 (the exit code):\necho ${PIPESTATUS[1]}\n1\n\nIn a script, make sure the pipeline has finished executing before you seek the contents of the PIPESTATUS array variable. \nFor an example of interesting use of the PIPESTATUS array variable, see this answer regarding combining Bash command grouping and pipe status. You could test the array variable in the way suggested by Gilles in the comments, although you will first need to run the pipeline again:\ndmesg | grep -iw 'nnse' | wc -l\n[ ${PIPESTATUS[1]} -eq 1 ] && do_something_here\n\nThis is just a fragment, as I don't know what sort of script you are intending, but I hope knowing about PIPESTATUS may be of some use for you. There are many Bash array variables like PIPESTATUS that can be extremely useful; see the Bash reference guide for the whole list, and the other Stackexchange sites for examples of their usage.\n\nA: It doesn't answer your question about pipes, but you can rearrange:\ntest $(ls -l | wc -l) -eq 1 && echo \"worked\"\n\nAnd there's a few solutions on SO, this being the nicest:\nls -l | wc -l | { read wc; test $wc -eq 7 && echo \"woohoo\"; }\n\n\nA: This doesn't cover every test case, but if you can use a regular expression, and grep the piped string, it's pretty straight forward because grep is test-like in that it has a non-zero exit when no match is found \ncat file | wc -l | grep -qE '^\\s*1\\s*$'\n\nExtended regular expressions allow you to cover many cases with this technique. For giggles, a test case:\nfor i in 1 11 '' foo; do \n  if echo $i | grep -qE '^\\s*1\\s*$'; then \n    echo \"'$i' matched\"\n  else\n    echo \"'$i' didn't match.\"\n  fi\ndone\n\noutputs:\n'1' matched\n'11' didn't match.\n'' didn't match.\n'foo' didn't match.\n\n", "Q: Backup strategy When backing up Ubuntu 12.04 is it necessary to backup system files outside of the home folder?  I have had a GRUB installation become corrupted by a subsequent update.  I need a strategy to recover from errant updates.  That is, to roll back my updates.\n\nA: I won't speak on whether or not you need to backup system files but if you want roll back on your entire system you could do something crazy with bup and dd.  We do something similar with our databases to give use almost infinite roll back capabilities.  But this is obviously on a smaller scale.\n\nbup is a program that backs things up.  It's short for \"backup.\" Can you\nbelieve that nobody else has named an open source program \"bup\" after all\nthis time?  Me neither.\nbup has a few advantages over other backup software:\n\n*\n\n*It uses a rolling checksum algorithm (similar to rsync) to split large\nfiles into chunks.  The most useful result of this is you can backup huge\nvirtual machine (VM) disk images, databases, and XML files incrementally,\neven though they're typically all in one huge file, and not use tons of\ndisk space for multiple versions.\n\n\n*It uses the packfile format from git (the open source version control\nsystem), so you can access the stored data even if you don't like bup's\nuser interface.\n\n\n*Unlike git, it writes packfiles directly (instead of having a separate\ngarbage collection / repacking stage) so it's fast even with gratuitously\nhuge amounts of data.  bup's improved index formats also allow you to\ntrack far more filenames than git (millions) and keep track of far more\nobjects (hundreds or thousands of gigabytes).\n\n\n*Data is \"automagically\" shared between incremental backups without having\nto know which backup is based on which other one - even if the backups\nare made from two different computers that don't even know about each\nother.  You just tell bup to back stuff up, and it saves only the minimum\namount of data needed.\n\n\n*You can back up directly to a remote bup server, without needing tons of\ntemporary disk space on the computer being backed up.  And if your backup\nis interrupted halfway through, the next run will pick up where you left\noff.  And it's easy to set up a bup server: just install bup on any\nmachine where you have ssh access.\n\n\n*Bup can use \"par2\" redundancy to recover corrupted backups even if your\ndisk has undetected bad sectors.\n\n\n*Even when a backup is incremental, you don't have to worry about\nrestoring the full backup, then each of the incrementals in turn; an\nincremental backup acts as if it's a full backup, it just takes less\ndisk space.\n\n\n*You can mount your bup repository as a FUSE filesystem and access the\ncontent that way, and even export it over Samba.\n\n\n*It's written in python (with some C parts to make it faster) so it's easy\nfor you to extend and maintain.\n\n\nA: Backing up your Home folder would not backup the GRUB or the system files, for that you need to do a whole system backup.\nYou can do a whole system backup using Clonezilla \nTo do that, first you would have to download the clonezilla ISO from here.\nAfter you have downloaded it, you will need to burn it to a CD.\nThen you will have to boot from it to do the full system Backup.\nThe full procedure for it is given here-\nhttp://clonezilla.org/clonezilla-live-doc.php\nYou will have to choose the option \"Save disk image\", the procedure for whic is given here-http://clonezilla.org/show-live-doc-content.php?topic=clonezilla-live/doc/01_Save_disk_image\nAfter you have made the backup, you can restore it using the option- \"Restore Disk Image\", the procedure for which is given here- http://clonezilla.org/show-live-doc-content.php?topic=clonezilla-live/doc/02_Restore_disk_image\nLook into it.\nIf you have any queries let us know.\nThank You!\n", "Q: Ubuntu Boot Error:Kernel Image not found I've been trying to install Ubuntu 13.04 (Raring Ringtail) from my FAT formatted USB installed with unetbooting and I got the error\n\nNo kernel Image found:\n\nI ran md5sums on the ISO image, and it tallies but error persists.\nI formatted the USB drive to FAT32 but I got the error\n\nNo UI Directive or config file found\n\nAny tips on how to solve this?\n\nA: You don't really need unetbootin any longer. You can write the ISO directly to USB using dd for Windows\nRemove all USB drives that you have installed except the one you want to install the Ubuntu ISO to before running the below command to avoid the possibility of overwriting other drives.\nYou would want to use a command like this (IT WILL ERASE YOUR USB DRIVE, BACK UP ANYTHING YOU WANT TO KEEP FIRST):\ndd.exe --filter=removable if=C:\\path\\to\\ubuntu.iso of=\\\\?\\\\Device\\\\Harddisk1\\\\Partition0\n\nThe exact directive you need the Harddisk portion of of= is highly dependant on your computer configuration. If you want to see the list of devices, use dd.exe --list. You'll want to look for an entry that has \"Removable media other than floppy. Block size = 512\". You always want to use Partition0 though.

Now in version 2.8 GIMP doesn't allow it anymore: you can Save only as .xcf but to save as .jpg or .png you must Export.\nIs there a way to get this old file saving functionality back?\n\nA: I remember reading on heise (german) that someone wrote a plugin to revert back to the old functionality.\nRunnning the following commands in a terminal will download the latest version of the plugin to Gimp 2.8's config directory and make it executable:\ngimp_dir=\".gimp-2.8\"\nwget https://github.com/akkana/gimp-plugins/raw/master/save-export-clean.py -O ~/${gimp_dir}/plug-ins/save-export-clean.py\nchmod a+x ~/${gimp_dir}/plug-ins/save-export-clean.py\n\nBut I have to say that it's not a big deal learning the new shortcut Ctrl+E. Also having a clean distinction between destructive export and save is actually a good thing.\n\nA: Starting from GIMP 2.8 we need to use the \"File → Export\" or \"File → Export to...\" menu entries, or alternatively the Ctrl+E or Ctrl+Shift+E keyboard shortcuts respectively, which will result in the Export dialog to allow you to save the work in your favorite image format.\nThe former Ctrl+S and Ctrl+Shift+S is now used to work with the project only. To save the project or \"Save as\" the project.\nGood luck!\n\nFor the comment of @Eric Leschinski I am dropping this edit:\nThat's about how you use your software. Many people uses mouse and it's ok if they love to do so. Personally I made my process as OpenFile/Tweak/Export/CloseFile[CloseGIMP] in a faster way by doing the CtrlO/Tweak/CtrlE/CtrlW[CtrlQ] and it takes 3~5 seconds (depending on your machine's speed. For the \"Save as\" Process it takes just one more step but it did the same before. So I suggest you to start by tweaking your key binding in order to make it faster. Good luck!\n\nA: Starting from GIMP 2.8, the behaviour changed:\n\n\n*\n\n*XCF is now the default format for saving images. This is because of the non-destructive nature of this file format: it retains the layers in the image.\n\n*PNG/JPEG are import and export formats. Use File -> Open to import these and File -> Export (or Overwrite) to save PNG/JPEG images.\n\n\nThis change was done to prevent people from accidentally losing their layers. However, this change has received immense criticism from many users.\nTo revert to the old behaviour as was the case in GIMP 2.6, follow these steps:\n\n\n*\n\n*Download https://raw.githubusercontent.com/akkana/gimp-plugins/master/saver.py\n\n*Save to ~/.gimp-2.8/plug-ins/ (so the location becomes something like /home/myuser/.gimp-2.8/plug-ins/saver.py)\n\n*Make saver.py executable: chmod +x saver.py\n\n*Restart GIMP\n\n*Go to Edit -> Shortcuts and search for \"Saver\"\n\n*Assign the shortcut CTRL+S to \"Saver\". Confirm you want to reassign the shortcut.\n\n*Assign the shortcut CTRL+Shift+S to \"Saver as\". Confirm you want to reassign the shortcut.\n\n\nNow you can simply use CTRL+S (save) and CTRL+Shift+S (save as) to save your files. Also, on exit GIMP won't ask to save your files to XCF anymore (if they have already been saved with saver).\nNow train yourself: in the File menu, use \"Saver\" and \"Saver as\". This two commands replace these 4 items: Save / Save As / Export / Export as. So click \"Saver\" or \"Saver as\" from now on :)\n\nA: Press ctrl+E and you will be able to save it in other formats like jpg png or go to file and click on Export.... and you will be able to save it.\n", "Q: Unable to boot to Windows 7 after installing Ubuntu on a separate drive I have searched everywhere on the internet and I cannot seem to find a solution to this problem.

Then i decided to increase it to 65 Gbs using this guide.\nThen i decided to delete this virtual disk (65 Gbs) to increase to about 150Gbs. The only thing i didn't follow the guide is that i delete this virtual disk from ubuntu using rm command (The guide seems mentioned to delete it from windows in the last step)\nAfter removing this virtual disk, i see the free disk space remained the same (not increased 65 Gbs as expected).\nAnyone know how to fix this, so that i can have 65 Gbs free space back?\nThank you very much\n\nA: I wouldn't recommend a virtual disk of that size. Wubi installs sometimes get corrupted and you don't want to risk losing 165 GB of data. For the most part, data that size can be stored anywhere e.g. on the /host partition or another NTFS partition. Then if your Wubi install gets corrupted this important data is not lost.\nBut to get to your main problem. I think there are some issues with large file creation via Ubuntu. I have deleted a virtual disk before and found that Windows' chkdsk will later recover it (and move it to a \\found.000 folder) - so whatever is doing the rm is doing something that Windows doesn't quite believe is complete.\nWhat I would recommend in this case is to boot Windows, run a chkdsk /f and then make sure that the file hasn't been recovered. When it's done you should have your space back. Then I would do something other than creating a 165 GB virtual disk. (This is a single file that is larger than most hard disks were only 5 years or so ago).\n", "Q: BEATS AUDIO dv7 HP Who can help me with Linux audio problems generally (I tried ubuntu fedora Manjaro ect and I can not make it work on my laptop 4.1 hp dv7-6b77dx (has 2 speakers under the screen two more in the front and a subwoofer on the bottom next to the baterria)\nversions of Linux with kernel 3.2 works sub and two speakers from but not those that are on the screen (HDA Analyzer Here I can make funionen all)\nAnd With the Kernel 3.5 onwards operate 4 speakers but no subwoofer (Here I have not been able to work with the HDA ANALIZER)\n\nQuien me puede ayudar con problemas de audio en Linux general ( He probado manjaro ubuntu fedora ect  y no puedo hacer que funcione el 4.1 de mi laptop hp dv7-6b77dx   ( tiene 2 bosinas bajo la pantalla 2 mas en la parte de enfrente y un subwoofer por la parte de abajo junto a la baterria )\nlas versiones de linux con kernel 3.2 funciona el sub y las dos bocinas de entre pero no las que estan bajo la pantalla  (Aqui con HDA  ANAlizer  puedo hacer que funionen todas)\nY Con el Kernel 3.5 en adelante funcionan las 4 bosinas pero no el subwoofer ( Aqui no lo he podido hacer funcionar con el HDA ANALIZER)\n\nA: see this link.

Most concrete use cases of renaming consist of a regexp replacement: s/REGEXP/REPLACEMENT/. To remove the existing extension, replace everything starting at the last . character.\nrename 's/\\.[^.]*$/.txt/' /path/to/directory/*\n\nIf your files have no extension (no . in their name), you can either use $ (which matches the end of the file name) as the regexp, or append .txt to the name.\nrename '$_ = \"$_.txt\"'  /path/to/directory/*\n\nThis doesn't change the content of the files, it only renames them.

Please feel free to edit my answer in that case.\n\nOriginal description:\n\n1) It will rename just the file extension (due to use of\n  ${FNAME%.so}.dylib).

I want to install the ubuntu 12.04.2 in my computer, which already has windows 8.\nI have no idea how to do it, I cannot understand a single word of the other post since I'm new in all this.\nCan somebody help me using easy lenguage (and pictures if possible), please?\n\nA: Firstly you will need a iso Ubuntu disk. With some new Window 8 computers you have to  enter the Bios right at start up and disable the save boot option. To enter the Bios are not the same on all the different computers. Some you have to press Del or F10 etc. Normally right at start up at the bottom of the screen for 1 or 2 seconds it will give you the info. Then change the boot order to CD first then second USB then thirtly HDD and also disable the - save boot option - if available. Insert the Ubuntu CD reboot and follow the instructions. On some of these new machines if you install to dual boot, it will start to install but stop and on some machines even open your CD drive. Then you have a chance to install deleting Windows and use the whole HDD for Ubuntu only. If This still do not work use a 8GB USB stick and install Ubuntu on it. Boot from it and format the HDD. Now you should be able to install Ubuntu from the iso CD. If you do not want to do any of the installation run your Computer From the biggest USB stick you can afford. The USB stick is not as fast as a HDD but you can save your files on the Windows HDD.\n", "Q: Ubuntu 12.04 rename folders in mnt & media Installing a new VPN on a new workstation and it has been a year since I did my last Virtualbox setup.  Everything works but I don't like how the shared folders in media are labeled as sf_folder.  I was curious to know can I rename these folders or would it cause issues?  I didn't see a solution or any documentation on it from a search.  Setup is now Windows 7 and Ubuntu 12.04 running Virtualbox.  This may be another question but after the initial install and setup of shared folders and Guest Additions I only see a folder in media and not mnt.  I can get a shared folder in mnt with sudo ln -sf /media/folder /mnt/ but I don't know yet if there's a better way yet.  \n\nA: sf_ is alwasy prepended by VirtualBox to indicate that it's a shared folder. This is done by a vbox service, part of the Guest Additions. You can bind the shared folder directory to another of your choice in mtab if you desire.\nUse this to open the mtab file:\nsudo gedit /etc/mtab\n\nIn the mtab file enter a new line at the bottom.  The format you want to use is:\n/real/folder/location  /where/youwantit/toshow bind rw 0 0\n\nHere's an example from one of mine:\n/media/sf_IBM /opt/ibm bind rw 0 0\n\nIt's standard practice to hit [enter] when you've finished your edit so there is a new line entry at the end of the file.\n\nA: I figured out how to add a folder in the mnt location from the media location without having sf_.\nI used this code:\nsudo mount --bind /media/sf_folder /mnt/folder\n", "Q: Customize nemo keyboard shortcuts in Ubuntu 13.04 I'm on Ubuntu 13.04 and ran through the steps outlined on Completely integrate nemo in Ubuntu.\nI understand that Nemo is a cloned-fork off of Nautilus and was hoping that I'd be able to adjust the keyboard shortcuts for it in the same way... For Nautilus  we can edit the \"accels\" file at ~/.config/nautilus/accels.\nDoes Nemo not have this ability?\nThe version of Nemo on my system is 1.8.2.\n\nA: Anand Sharma answer (after I edited his question):\n\nThe \"accels\" file for Nemo when installed with the method linked to\n  above is located at: ~/.gnome2/accels/nemo. The two\n  files, ~/.config/nautilus/accels and ~/.gnome2/accels/nemo are very close to\n  the same.\nThe reason why I desperately wanted to find how to edit\n  keyboard-shortcuts was cause I HATE the default for focusing on the\n  location-bar which is Ctrl + L. Practically\n  every other application you can think of (e.g. Windows Explorer, Internet Explorer, Chrome, Firefox... list goes on) that has an\n  \"address bar\" places focus there using the Alt+D\n  combination.\nEditing the following line in either of the \"accel\" files did the\n  trick for me (make sure you remove the semi-colon, too):\nFrom:   \n; (gtk_accel_path \"<Actions>/ShellActions/Edit Location\" \"<Primary>L\")\n\nTo:   \n(gtk_accel_path \"<Actions>/ShellActions/Edit Location\" \"<Alt>d\")\n\n\n\nA: I also had to define the GNOME22_USER_DIR environment variable. All in all, this is what I did:\n\n*\n\n*Add export GNOME22_USER_DIR=\"$HOME/.config/nemo\" to ~/.profile.\n\n*Create an empty file ~/.config/nemo/accels/nemo.\n\n*Restart the System, start Nemo, close Nemo.\n\n*The file created in 2. now should have been filled with all available actions. If not, see below list.\n\n*Edit the desired lines, remove the comment character (;) and spaces from the start. Save your changes in a backup.

You may want to ping the maintainer and see what their plans are for future builds and if they are going to include one for 2.7.5. If possible, I would recommend this over installing from source. As with any new software, I would recommending building this out on a test system first.\nAnother option is to use a sandbox(pyenv) to run any new untested software package. A straight installation onto your system could adversely impact the operation of your machine.\nThe package pyenv will allow one to install a non-system Python version on your box without impacting the main Python package installed on your machine( Again: Your system is dependent on the currently installed version of Python and upgrading it could break your system). Previously, Pythonbrew was recommended for isolating python packages from the system, but that has since been deprecated and superseded by the pyenv package.\nThe pyenv package provides the following functionality:\n\n\n*\n\n*Lets you change the global Python version on a per-user basis.\n\n*Provides support for per-project Python versions.\n\n*Allows you to override the Python version with an environment variable.\n\n*Search commands from multiple versions of Python at a time. \n\n\nInstallation\n\n\n*\n\n*Check out pyenv into ~/.pyenv.\ngit clone git://github.com/yyuu/pyenv.git .pyenv\n\n\n*Add ~/.pyenv/bin to your $PATH for access to the pyenv command-line utility.\necho 'export PATH=\"$HOME/.pyenv/bin:$PATH\"' >> ~/.bash_profile\n\nZsh note: Modify your ~/.zshenv file instead of ~/.bash_profile.\n\n*Add pyenv init to your shell to enable shims and auto-completion.\necho 'eval \"$(pyenv init -)\"' >> ~/.bash_profile\n\nZsh note: Modify your ~/.zshenv file instead of ~/.bash_profile.\n\n*Restart your shell so the path changes take effect. You can now begin using pyenv.\nexec $SHELL\n\n\n*Install Python versions into ~/.pyenv/versions. For example, to install Python 2.7.5, download and unpack the source, then run:\npyenv install 2.7.5\n\nNOTE If you need to pass configuration options to build from source, please use CONFIGURE_OPTS environment variable.\n\n*Rebuild the shim binaries. You should do this any time you install a new Python binary (for example, when installing a new Python version, or when installing a package that provides a binary).\npyenv rehash\n\n", "Q: Mythbuntu minimum requrements include DVD player or flash drive boot Mythbuntu is installed from an ISO file that is al little larger than can be burned to a CD ROM.

I was disappointed with the benchmark results I got, see Eigen-Magma. I was actually expecting e.g. DGEMM to deliver about 1.3 TFlop/s but instead in my benchmarks it stayed short at 200 GFlop/s with DGEMM.\nHowever, after some additional research I learned that it is possible to change the Double Precision (DP) rate of the GTX Titan card to 1/3th of the Single Precision (SP) see the last section \"I'm a cheap Tesla then?\" first paragraph and that by default the Titan will operate at 1/24th of the possible DP rate which is what I experienced in my benchmarks.\nThe question is then how can I change the DP rate of a nVidia Titan GTX card on Ubuntu 12.04 TS? I have the latest nVidia drivers installed.\n\nA: OK I found the setting that solves the problem, it is to check the CUDA-Double precision box in the PowerMizer entry of the nvidia-settings tool. I get about 3x better DP performance using CUBLAS. I reach 1.2 TFlop/s using a modified version of the CUDA sample matrixMulCUBLAS that uses DGEMM and therefore the issue is resolved.  \n\n", "Q: Samba share not accessible from Windows 7 (on domain) via hostname I have spent several days attempting to solve this- none of the answers on this forum or any other were able to help.  I tried everything.  I read the entire Samba manual.  Nothing worked.\nHappily, I have solved it and would like to share the answer with the community.\nHere was my specific issue:\nI have Samba 3.6.3 running on Ubuntu Server 12.04.  The server is joined to my company domain with PowerBroker Identity Services Open Edition (they purchased Likewise).  I followed the manual and set up a share using AD group permissions.  It was accessible from Linux and Mac using AD permissions.  From Windows 7, it was accessible only on machines not joined to the domain.  Once joined to the domain it was only accessible via IP- short hostname and FQDN would respond with a password error.\n\nA: Clearly, there was an issue with group security policy on the domain- but it was not an option to change security policy for one network share.\nBased on my research, the issue was related to how AD created Kerberos tickets- and the domain policy was to only use Kerberos.  Samba works with NTMLv2 but Samba was not responsible for authentication- AD was, and PBIS was responsible for making that happen.\nThe issue was stemming from Samba not accessing PBIS' keytab file.  I resolved that by entering this in smb.conf under [global]:\nKerberos method = dedicated keytab\ndedicated keytab file = /etc/krb5.keytab\n\nThe default for Kerberos method is secrets only which uses a tdb file for tickets- that doesn't work with PBIS.  You have to tell Samba to only use the keytab file that PBIS uses.\nOnce I did that- authentication worked correctly with IP, short hostname, and FQDN.\nYou can find which keytab file PBIS is using by checking the krb5.conf file (usually /etc/krb5.conf) and checking the default_keytab_name setting.\nFor reference, here is my smb.conf:\n[global]\nsecurity = ADS\nworkgroup = DOMAIN\nrealm = DOMAIN.COM\nmachine password timeout = 0\nserver string = %h\nlocal master = no\nencrypt passwords = yes\nKerberos method = dedicated keytab\ndedicated keytab file = /etc/krb5.keytab\ndeadtime = 20\nlog level = 20\ndebug pid = true\ndebug class = yes\nlog file = /var/log/samba-pbis.log\n\n[test]\ncomment = test\npath = /test\nbrowseable = yes\nread only = no\nwriteable = yes\nvalid users = @DOMAIN\\user1 @DOMAIN\\domain^users\nadmin users = @DOMAIN\\domain^admins\nguest ok = yes\ncreate mask = 0774\ndirectory mask = 0774\ninherit acls = yes\ninherit permissions = yes\n\n", "Q: How to set app icon in the .desktop file of an Ubuntu Touch application?

Or do I need to move the launcher.png to /usr/share/myapp/launcher.png via in-app-code?\n\nA: There are two things wrong with how you're doing things.\nFist of all, .desktop files are intended for installed apps, not for running via Ctrl+R. To install your app, you need to package it and install the package. You can find more details about packaging your app and publishing it in the Click App Store here.\nSecond of all, the paths you have in the .desktop should be local files, not absolute paths. Here is an example of a .desktop file:\n[Desktop Entry]\nName=Tasks\nComment=Your tasks, every device, everywhere.\nExec=qmlscene $@ ubuntu-tasks.qml\nIcon=ubuntu-tasks.png\nTerminal=false\nType=Application\nX-Ubuntu-Touch=true\n\nA couple of things to note:\n\n\n*\n\n*The Exec line should be in the format of qmlscene $@ <file.qml>, with just the name of your main QML file, no directory information.\n\n*The Icon line should be in the form of Icon=<icon.png>, with just the file name (including the extension), no directory information.\nNow the information I've provided above is for running your app on an Ubuntu Touch device by packaging it in a Click package. Click packages are intended for Ubuntu Touch and currently don't integrate with the Unity desktop. So, if you want to be able to run your app from the Dash/Launcher and also see its icon, you will need to do two things:\n\n\n*\n\n*Copy your .desktop file to ~/.local/share/applications and use an absolute path to your icon instead of just the file name, as you would when packaging the app.\n\n*Copy your icon to ~/.icons\n\nA: Desktop Version: For me in Ubuntu 20.04 Desktop the icon of Squeezeplay was not showing up, neither in the search window, nor in the gnome3 side dock panel.\nThe solution above worked from @iBelieve for me showing up an icon in the search dialog, but not in the gnome side panel.\nAdding the StartupWMClass=jive (found out clicking the opened application using xprop WM_CLASS in the cli)to the desktop file from the answer here completed the Mission, now I can see everywhere (search dialog, pressing \"Windows\" key and gnome dock side panel) the provided icon file (png file format, max size 512x512, I choose 256x256)!

Try resetting your password.\nThere are multiple causes of the problem that can sometimes be solved by doing this.\nThis question explains how.\nWhen you reset your password, make sure it is at least one character long. (Of course, for security, it should be much longer. But blank/empty passwords sometimes trigger bugs. So it's especially important, for the purposes of troubleshooting this problem, that it not be totally blank. Of course, it's still best if it's a good, strong password.)\nIn case of a bug relating to the interpretation of non-English symbols, you might try a password containing just Latin (\"English\") characters, numbers, and/or common internationally used punctuation symbols.\nThere is an easier way to change your password that is not generally applicable but may work in your particular situation. The Software Center authenticates graphically with PolicyKit. You can try changing your password non-graphically from the command-line. If you want to try this, press Ctrl+Alt+T to open a Terminal window. Then run:\npasswd\n\nThat will let you try to change your password. You'll have to type the old password, then the new password twice. In the Terminal, you won't see any placeholder characters like * when you enter a password. It will look like nothing is happening. That's normal; just type each password in and press enter.\nIf that fails, or if it appears to succeed but you still cannot authenticate successfully in the Software Center, you can try:\nsudo passwd $USER\n\nMake sure to include $USER. Don't replace it with anything, just type it as is. It automatically represents your username. (This differs from the above command in that this attempts to authenticate you as root and then change your password as root. Sometimes that succeeds where other methods fail. Sometimes.)\nIf neither of those works, you'll have to try changing your password in one of those ways. If you want, you can just skip to that.\nIf you are unable to complete any of those techniques for changing your password, or get error messages, try this way. (If you are able to change your password successfully but the Software Center still won't authenticate you, then that method is unlikely to produce any better results, though.)\n5. I mentioned that the Software Center uses PolicyKit for authentication. Perhaps that's what's broken.\nTo see, try running this command in the Terminal (Ctrl+Alt+T):\nsudo echo success\n\nYou'll have to enter your password (don't worry that nothing appears on the screen as you type it in) and press Enter.\nIf that command outputs success in the Terminal, then you were able to run a command as root with sudo. You should then add that information to your answer, and also let us know what flavor of Ubuntu you are running (regular Ubuntu, Kubuntu, Xubuntu, Lubuntu, etc.). You should also provide us with the output of these commands:\nps aux | grep [p]olkit\npkcheck --action-id org.freedesktop.systemtoolsbackends.set --allow-user-interaction --process $(pidof -s bash)\n\nAnd please also describe what, if anything, happens when you run that second command, besides text appearing on the terminal. It might be nothing, but typically you'll get a graphical authentication dialog followed by text output.\nThat second command tests if PolicyKit is working for authentication. (Milan Bouchet-Valat deserves credit for the general form of that command; see the comments in this bug.)\nOther people with a similar problem who are reading this can create a new question and include these results (or add these results to your question, if you have already created one for the problem).\n6. You may be able to use sudo and gksu/gksudo as a workaround.\nIf sudo echo success worked (see above), then regardless of the output of the subsequent commands, this means sudo is working.\nsudo cannot replace PolicyKit entirely, in the context of the way Ubuntu software works. But it can replace it mostly, because many programs that use PolicyKit to perform administrative tasks will also work when run with sudo.\nFor graphical programs, you should use gksudo and not plain sudo. Try:\ngksudo software-center\n\nIf you don't have gksudo, then you can install it. It is provided by the gksu package. You can't install it in the Software Center if the Software Center is not working, but you can install it on the command-line:\nsudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install gksu\n\nYou can install other software that way too, as a workaround to being able to use the Software Center.\nIf you don't want to install gksudo or it doesn't work, you can safely use sudo -H or sudo -i to attempt to run graphical applications as root:\nsudo -H software-center\n\nsudo -i software-center\nIf sudo apt-get ... works for installing software but you are unable to get the Software Center to work by running it with gksudo, sudo -H, or sudo -i, then you can install another graphical package browsing and installation/deinstallation program: Synaptic.\nsudo apt-get update       # you can omit this if you've run it very recently\nsudo apt-get install synaptic\n\nSome of my recent experiences troubleshooting Software Center problems suggest to me that Synaptic may run successfully as root even in situations where the Software Center is unable to do so. This is really just a guess; I could be mistaken. If you cannot run the Software Center, it's worth a try.\ngksudo synaptic\n\nsudo -H synaptic\nsudo -i synaptic\n\n7. If sudo doesn't work, maybe you're not an administrator.\nIf you were able to run sudo echo success and have success printed in the console below where you entered the command, then you are an administrator. (Either that, or you have special privileges to run the echo command as root, which is very unlikely.)\nBut if that failed, the most likely (though not only) cause is that you aren't really an administrator. Sometimes users accidentally remove their own administrative powers. And there could potentially be bugs that would cause this (maybe...).\nTo check if you are an administrator, run:\ngroups\n\nYou're running Ubuntu 12.10. In Ubuntu 12.04 and later (including 12.10), administrators are members of the sudo group. So, see if sudo is listed in the output of groups.\nIf it is not listed, then use one of these techniques to add yourself back as an administrator.\n\n\n*\n\n*If they don't work, then you can use this more complicated technique. When you get to step 9, use the part that says \"Alternatively, if you want to make a user an administrator\".\n\n\nIf sudo is listed, then there may some misconfiguration preventing members of the sudo group from being recognized as administrators. In that case, enter recovery mode and examine the contents of the file /etc/sudoers.\n\n\n*\n\n*If you cannot enter recovery mode, then you can perform the first 7 steps of this procedure (ending with sudo mount /dev/sda1 /mnt, replacing /dev/sda1 with the root partition of your installed Ubuntu system, which that procedure explains how to find).\nThen examine the file /mnt/etc/sudoers. (You can do this from the graphical file browser in the live system, or with the command cat /mnt/etc/sudoers.)\nThe file should contain:\n# Allow members of group sudo to execute any command\n%sudo   ALL=(ALL:ALL) ALL\n\nIn particular, there should not be a # symbol at the beginning of the line that starts with %sudo. (That would make it a comment, i.e., ignored by Ubuntu.)\nIf it's missing or starts with #, you can fix it by editing the file by running:\nvisudo\n\nYou should not edit the file without visudo, because visudo keeps you from messing it up in severe ways and causing more problems. (You can still create a bad configuration, but it keeps you from creating an ambiguous or meaningless one by checking for good syntax.)\n\n\n*\n\n*In recovery mode, you'll often have to run this first to enable you to make changes to the system:\nmount -o remount,rw /\n\nSo either run that before visudo, or if you run visudo and it's unable to save changes, then run that mount command and try visudo again.\n\n*If you're doing this from a live CD/DVD/USB, don't run plain visudo, because that will not do what you want. That would edit the configuration of the live system. Also, unlike in recovery mode, on a live CD you have to use sudo to run commands as root. So instead, run:\nsudo visudo -f /mnt/etc/sudoers\n\nOn a live CD, if you followed step 7 there correctly, you should not need to run any further mount command (and if you did run that mount -o remount command, it would not do what you wanted, because it would try to remount the live environment's filesystem rather than the installed OS's filesystem).\n8. Maybe your sudoers file is misconfigured in a less common way.\nIf you're in the sudo group and the %sudo   ALL=(ALL:ALL) ALL line was present and uncommented in your sudoers file (see above), then it's still possible some misconfiguration in that file could be causing the problem.\nFor example, an exception (that partially or fully undoes the %sudo line) could be present afterwards.\nSo if you are in the sudo group but sudo echo success does not work when run while booted normally into the installed system (i.e., not a live CD/DVD/USB, and not recovery mode), please provide us with the complete and exact contents of the /etc/sudoers file.\nYou can add that to your question.\nFor others experiencing similar problems, you can add that to your own question.\n", "Q: Why did KDE 4.11 from ppa remove kwin-style-qtcurve?

The ISSUE is how the Unified Extensible Firmware Interface (UEFI) Secure Boot (protocol) v2.3.1 that Microsoft has mandated for all Windows 8 64bit systems illegally blocks boot loading software (such as FREE and legal Ubuntu) from being loaded unless a Microsoft or one of it’s affiliates (collaborators) has digitally sign (cryptographic signature) your code with their UEFI signing key (KEK certificate which is a DER encoded binary X509 v3 certificate) stored in the firmware.\nWhy should Ubuntu developers or any other free software developer be held hostage and forced to PAY Microsoft any FEE for the right and privilege of running our own software?  \nNo to mention there is no centralized signing authority to provide UEFI keys. Microsoft has made itself the only authority (gatekeeper) holding all the master keys. \nI want to point out there is NO such thing as “Windows Hardware” because Microsoft does NOT manufacture Lenovo, Sony, Toshiba, Acer, Asus, MSI, VIA, HP, Dell, Celvo, Sager, etc… This is Microsoft extending its own brand (software) upon firmware, claiming it’s their platform. Why do the manufactures accept this theft of their hardware product?\n\nA: I didn't quite understand your question, it is like an opinion. Your title suggests you want to get pass the secure boot function to install ubuntu. (but your question content asks, why ms doing all the stuff)\nMoreover, UEFI is not depended upon secure boot. Secure boot is a feature of UEFI. UEFI can be there without secure boot enabled.\nWell as an answer based on your title , all I can say, from ubuntu 12.10 the secure boot is supported. But as the secure boot implementation varied from manufacturer to manufacturer, it may not be reliable. One more important thing, you need 64bit Ubuntu to work with UEFI.\nSo, if you are facing problem just turn off the secure boot in firmware settings page (which in general called as BIOS). That's all. \nAnd here goes the guide to install ubuntu in a win 8 laptop : Installing Ubuntu Alongside a Pre-Installed Windows with UEFI\n\nA: Microsoft has certainly excluded out Linux, an open platform, on the Windows Surface RT tablets! \nIf you one of the many who happen to purchase a Microsoft Surface RT Tablet, you should know Android, Linux, Ubuntu, not even Windows 8.1, 8, 7, Vista, XP or any flavor of Windows will run except RT only! There is NO disable UEFI mode given. Your locked into using only 1 operating system for life on that device, given the OS is locked down not to the owner, but the device itself. \nIf you want to run Ubuntu on a Microsoft Surface Tablet, the word “jailbreak” certainly does apply. \n\nA: Dr. Richard Stallman, one of the most influential and important people in the Linux community, founder of the GNU Project and the Free Software Foundation, has basically said UEFI Secure Boot protocol should be illegal for how it is implemented in favor of only supporting the proprietary Windows monopoly. \nHe points out that the security feature causes the machine to only work with programs that are signed with a digital key that Microsoft has made itself the central authority. For everyone else, not just Linux enthusiast, this anti-social behavior encroaches upon the sovereignty of open platforms for everyone on the planet. \nExcuse me, but this truly is an ACT of war! Microsoft is the invading advisory here, by claiming it has supreme authority over everyone else to dictate their terms as usual. No negotiation was ever given. It’s the same with the EULA, an ultimatum that demands 100% submission and surrender to their terms. No refunds are honored too! \nToday, Microsoft has placed a barrier against liberty and everyone, it's a restrictive anti-competition business tactic, that hinders and works against every open platform and society (human race). As everyone knows we all build upon code, just as nobody sits down and innovates a 747-400 Jumbo Jet alone, all by themselves. There are over 6 million parts to a 747-400. Now imagine 50 million lines of code that an modern operating consist of. This effort is only possible through the collaboration and cooperation of a great many people, in the past and present. For humanity to advance in the future, this same strategy of building upon prior work, is required. No exceptions, no exclusions, our species doesn’t pass on genetic knowledge, we obtain it from a born blank slate. \nTomorrow holds the extermination of all open platforms, if we don’t stand up against the aggression of Microsoft’s extremist tyranny! It’s time to liberate humanity, assuming you’re a human being who values living in a world of choice, as that is what the open platform insures for all of us!\n\nA: The answer to \"How to Jail Break UEFI to RUN Ubuntu?\" is that you shouldn't need to do that, if the UEFI secure boot protocol wasn't criminalized into a private business tool for profiteering. This is a much deeper social issue on display than what appears at the surface; a reflection of an economy without a conscience. \n", "Q: Executing script from shell problem Lubuntu Raring Ringtail.

I understand that Unity is the default desktop environment for Ubuntu. What is GNOME and how is it related to/different from Unity?\n\nA: What is GNOME?\nGNOME is a lot of things. Usually, GNOME refers to GNOME Desktop Environment. Quoting the Arch Wiki:\n\nA desktop environment bundles together a variety of X clients to provide common graphical user interface elements such as icons, toolbars, wallpapers, and desktop widgets. Additionally, most desktop environments include a set of integrated applications and utilities. \n\nIt is created and maintained by the GNOME foundation. They are the driving force behind a large number of popular applications, as well as the providers of a set of libraries such as GTK, GObject and even a language called Vala, which are used to build the applications in the GNOME DE, and are part of the GNOME project as a whole.\nThere are two relatively well known versions of GNOME: GNOME2, long since obsolete and dead, and GNOME3, the current version. Ubuntu have tracked GNOME (whichever version was current) for as long as I can remember. You can see GNOME2 in action in Ubuntu 10.04, for example. Once GNOME2 went away, a classic mode variously called GNOME Classic, GNOME Flashback (and possibly other names), with nowhere near the flexibility or customizability of GNOME2 was introduced. It just sort-of looked like GNOME2. \nGNOME2 was forked to become MATE. MATE is the closest experience to GNOME2 you can get now, but with feature updates. Ubuntu MATE is now an official flavour.\nGNOME3 is what you see when you look at the GNOME website, or when you install Ubuntu GNOME, and is underneath many applications in Ubuntu, and Cinnamon. MATE is adding support for GTK3, the library underneath GNOME3. Typically when end-users speak of GNOME3, they mean GNOME Shell (since that is what you see).\nHow does it relate to Unity?\nYou can think of GNOME as the parent of the Ubuntu default Desktop Environment (DE) (or an uncle, at least). It is the upstream project of many Ubuntu applications.\nUbuntu's default desktop environment uses most of the GNOME applications with a few changes:\n\n\n*\n\n*Unity instead of GNOME Shell (up to Ubuntu 17.04)\n\n*Firefox instead of Web (once called Epiphany)\n\n*Thunderbird instead of Evolution\n\n*LibreOffice Write instead of Abiword\n\n*some patches to GNOME Terminal and Nautilus, I think.\n\n*Ambiance GTK theme instead of Adwaita\n\n*and perhaps a few more\n\n\nUnity and GNOME Shell have a few similarities:\n\n\n*\n\n*A top panel\n\n*A dock\n\n*A searchable replacement for the menu system for listing applications.\n\n\nHowever, I think the similarities end there.\nThe Ubuntu GNOME distribution uses GNOME except the few cases where applications have been patched (like GNOME Terminal).\n\nRelevant reading:\n\n\n*\n\n*What is the relationship between Unity, Gnome, Gnome 3, Compiz, Metacity, and LightDM?  \n\n*What kinds of desktop environments and shells are available?\n\n*When installing packages (particularly those with graphical UIs) how do you determine which is fitting for your distribution?\n\n*What is the default desktop environment for Ubuntu 13.10?\n\n*What is a desktop environment, session and shell?\n\nA: GNOME is a project that provide support GNOME desktop environment, which in turn uses the GNOME Shell as default shell. I will presume you are talking about the differences between the Unity shell and GNOME Shell (which are the only things that can be accurately compared).\n\nTechnically, the only differences is that while GNOME Shell uses mutter/clutter (and sometimes metacity, but is not the default) as window manager, Unity uses Compiz (in fact, Unity is a Compiz plugin, but lets forget about that) and the use of NotifyOSD instead of libnotify library. After that, there aren't any other important architectural changes. Both use most of the same libraries (which in turn seems to cause conflicts when you install both), and Unity provides integration with 3rd party services (with the Scope and Lens features).\nThen the other differences are purely aesthetics, the use of top bar + launcher/dock (at the left) + dash vs GNOME's top bar + dash, the use of different theming, in general, they try to offer different user experience.\nNow, from the institutional point of view, Unity is pushed forward by the Ayatana Project while as I said at the start GNOME Shell is developed by the GNOME project. And that's most of it. So, actually there's more in common between GNOME Shell and Unity than other shells, like kdm, xfwm4, etc.; through there's little in common between Unity shell and Cinnamon (if you ignore the use of GTK3).\n\nA: There exist a lot of different desktop environments and window managers for Linux. Gnome used to be the default one for Ubuntu, but in recent versions this has changed to being Unity.\n", "Q: Ubuntu 12.04 doesn't shutdown I am a Ubuntu newbie. I installed Ubuntu 12.04 on my Lenovo Ideapad S205 3 days ago. Installation and working is no problem but it doesn't power off on shutdown. Hard disk activity goes off but the fan and screen stays on. I have seen a few threads here that pointed out this issue. I tried some of the options that have worked for some users like using \"shutodwn\" and \"poweroff\" commands and installing certain updates. However, none of them worked for me (which is why I am posting this obviously). Please help. \n\nA: Try using the command\nshutdown -h \n\nor \nshutdown -P\n\nwhere from man page:\n-h     Requests that the system be either halted or powered off after it has been brought down, with the choice as to which left up to the system.\n-P     Requests that the system be powered off after it has been brought down.\n\n\nA: Try running shutdown with the -h option:\nshutdown -h now\n\nHowever if your system halts it is still safe to switch it off with poweroff button.\n\nA: I had that same problem on my HP laptop. Found the solution here. I think it will work for you too. After this change you should be able to shutdown normally.\n\n\n*\n\n*Open terminal and run: gksudo gedit /etc/default/grub\n\n*the text editor opens and loads the file. Find the line that starts with GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT and add reboot=bios to the end. It should result in something like: GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT=\"quiet splash reboot=bios\"\n\n*Save the file and go back to the terminal and run: sudo update-grub\nAfter that, reboots and shutdowns should start working properly.\n\nA: I think you have installed ubuntu with acpi=off option,\nthat option restrict system to shutdown,\ncheck your grub and erase the code \"acpi=off\" and reboot, may be it will work.\n", "Q: how to skip \"execute file\" dialog in lubuntu (PCManFM) When I click on an executable file in PCManFM (default file manager in Lubuntu), I get an “Execute File” dialog with three options (Execute, Execute in terminal, Cancel).

Before this time I have installed prestashop without any issues. But after a long time when I tried to install prestashop today, it really showed me a strange error. The error is like this:\nWarning: require(/var/www/Prestashop/config/config.inc.php): failed to open stream: Permission denied in /var/www/Prestashop/index.php on line 27 Fatal error: require(): Failed opening required '/var/www/Prestashop/config/config.inc.php' (include_path='.:/usr/share/php:/usr/share/pear/PEAR') in /var/www/Prestashop/index.php on line 27\n\nFor that I decided to debug the error so I went through many blogs and forums and I checked my php.ini file. The file is like this.\nAfter going through many blogs someone had said that the error is for php pear package the link is here.\nAfter that I just made edit my php.ini pear url like this:\n;UNIX: \"/path1:/path2\"\ninclude_path = \".:/usr/share/php:/usr/share/php/PEAR\"\n\nAfter that I just restarted my apache server but it did not worked for me. The same error is coming. So here can someone kindly tell me what's the issue here? and how to solve this?\n\nA: The error is produced by require() function. This function it will halt the php script when:\n\n\n*\n\n*the given file (in your case /var/www/Prestashop/config/config.inc.php file) doesn't exist or \n\n*when the user that call the function doesn't have permission to read that file.\n\n\nAccording with:\nWarning: require(/var/www/Prestashop/config/config.inc.php): failed to open stream: Permission denied in /var/www/Prestashop/index.php on line 27\n\nyour issue falls into the second case. To prevent this, you have to change the permissions for /var/www/Prestashop/config/config.inc.php file so that to allow other users to read the file. You can do this by running the following command from terminal:\nchmod +r /var/www/Prestashop/config/config.inc.php\n\nIf the error will appear after for other files too, follow the same method to change the permissions.\nCheck also the permissions for config directory. These must to be something like: drwxr-xr-x. If not, use this command in terminal:\nchmod +rx /var/www/Prestashop/config\n\n\nA: Permissions on directory /var/www/Prestashop/config are wrong. They are drwx------ meaning that ONLY the newuser user can access them. The webserver is run as www-data and obviously it can't access your config directory.\nThere's absolutely no harm at adding read permissions to both group and all.\nchmod +rx /var/www/Prestashop/config\n\nIt might be considered a security issue adding write permission to the directory, but also this is disputable since /tmp/ is always accessible and malicious software tends to use that as a support directory.\nOf course don't give write access to the files themselves as that would be a security issue.\nIf you really don't want to make it readable to the world you can change the owner to www-data\nsudo chown www-data /var/www/Prestashop/config\n\nthat should be enough since files inside the directory are world readable (except for the xml folder that again needs the right ownership or permissions).\n", "Q: User defined upstart jobs using Openbox I know that to enable user defined jobs for upstart you need to uncomment ubuntu in /etc/upstart-xsessions and this will allow user defined upstart jobs in ubuntu default Xsession. \nThe question is how to enable user defined upstart jobs using different session (e.g. openbox) I thought that this should be as easy as adding openbox line to /etc/upstart-xsessions. But after adding this line openbox just hangs during startup and I end up with having no window manager at all.\n\nA: I had the same problem with xmonad and found the following solution.\nWhen you add openbox to /etc/upstart-xsessions, the script /etc/X11/Xsession.d/99upstart substitutes the value of STARTUP environment variable with init --user, therefore openbox is not started by X.\nTo be able to run selected xsession, upstart emits event xsession with environment variableSESSION equal to your xsession. For xmonad I wrote the following script and put it to ~/.config/upstart/xmonad.conf:\nstart on xsession SESSION=xmonad\nstop on session-end\n\nexec xmonad\n\nI think you should just substitute all xmonad with openbox. If you want system-wide solution you have to put this script to /etc/init/\n", "Q: How to install Git in Lubuntu (APT is \"Unable to locate package libcur14-gnutls-dev\")? I've tried to install git to my laptop which runs lubuntu.I followed the pattern on git website and it says :\n\nTo install Git, you need to have the following libraries that Git depends on: curl, zlib, openssl, expat, and libiconv\n$ apt-get install libcurl4-gnutls-dev libexpat1-dev gettext \\\n  libz-dev libssl-dev\n\n\nHowever when I typed it, I got this :\ngwapps@gwapps-ThinkPad-X61:~$ sudo apt-get install libcur14-gnutls-dev libexpat1-dev gettext libz-dev libssl-dev\nReading package lists...

Specifically, you have told apt-get to try to install a package called libcur14-gnutls-dev. But the correct name is libcurl4-gnutls-dev.\nThat is, you have an l (i.e., a lower-case L) where you should have a 1 (a numeral one). It is (semantically) \"lib curl 4,\" not \"lib cur 14\".\nSo run this instead:\nsudo apt-get install libcurl4-gnutls-dev\n\n(Also, when installing packages on the command-line, it's advisable to run sudo apt-get update first, unless you have done so recently.)\nHowever, you might not want to install Git this way at all.\nThe instructions you're following appear to be for compiling Git yourself. That's a perfectly valid thing to do, but for most people it's a lot of unnecessary work, plus if you do that, the system will not be able to upgrade Git automatically when a newer version is available. (It may also, in some ways, have trouble integrating with the installed Git, because the package manager won't \"know\" it is installed.)'\nTherefore, as Tarun suggested, you may just want to install Git directly (Ubuntu has Git packages, which is way faster and simpler!).\nsudo apt-get install git-core\n\nTypically you only need to build Git from source yourself if you need a version newer than the version available for Ubuntu. Even in those situations, there are often alternatives, so feel free to let us know more about what you need.\n\nA: Go to Update Manager > Settings, then under the Ubuntu Software Tab, select \"Main Server\" in the server list drop down menu.\n", "Q: Private key not found I have tried to generate server certificate for apache2 earlier....\nI have noticed one error in apache server.

Since then my laptop won't connect to the wireless network and when I try and use the different fixes online it stops connecting via the Ethernet cable as well.

(For this, self-signed certificates are sometimes actually preferred, because even less trust is placed in the hands of third parties.)\n\n*Situations where information about your certificate will be widely published (web of trust). Typically this still only appropriate for websites if your certificate will only be used for SSL connections established for moderately sensitive purposes (not e-commerce).\n\n*Situations where it is impossible or useless for anybody to sign your certificate because no pertinent certificate authority exists, but your certificate will be extremely widely distributed, verified through other means, and probably even hard-coded into software or distributed under other secure means. I'm really just talking about certificate authorities' own certificates, here.\n\n*Sites that cannot afford to pay fees to a certificate authority, and don't really need SSL, but provide it with the hope that it will be of some benefit. (If you're doing e-commerce, you need SSL.)\n\n\nA bit of information on self-signed certificates can be found here (though I guess you may already have read that).\n", "Q: How to fix external hard disk READ ONLY?

This is probably your username's id if you only have one username. If you have more than one username on your system, run the command id and use the number after uid=.\n\n*gid=1000 - this option makes the group with id 1000 the group owner of the drive.

So I'm posting it here in hopes it might help other people if they get into the same position.\n\nTL;DR: If your USB drive suddenly becomes READONLY to Ubuntu after being connected to a Windows system, try reconnecting and doing a controlled \"Eject device\" on the Windows system.\n\nA: i shall just mention this here but when I plug my external HDD which is in a caddie sometimes it produces the Read-only situation which means NO adding to it ...   it seems sudo umount of said volume followed by sudo mount simply cures that for a while at least [may have to repeat]... no idea why that is but it simply does\n\nA: Another data point: I solved my identical problem doing what FumbleFingers described, but plugging back in to Ubuntu and doing an \"Unmount Volume\" (I'm using Xubuntu and this is the command in Thunar).

But error messages flashed \"deficiency in wine.\" So I searched the web for Ubuntu softwares and found John the Ripper but the problem is, I don't understand how to use it. And I am not aware of how to browse the directories from terminal.\n\nA: You can browse directories using cd <directory_name>\\<inside_directory_name> in terminal. Or just type cd and some initial letter (case sensitive), then press Tab to autocomplete folder name.\nTry this software\nhttp://rarcrack.sourceforge.net/\nAll instructions are given in page, I am writing from it for any fureture references, \nSave the package to a location, say Downloads.\nOpen up a terminal, type cd Downloads (we are changing to Downloads directory)\nexecute tar -xjf rarcrack-0.2.tar.bz2 → this will extract the files.\nGet into the extracted folder, execute cd rarcrack-0.2\nCompile the program, execute make\nInstall the program by executing sudo make install\nNow this program is installed.\nUsage\nOpen a terminal, use cd to goto directory where you file is stored. say named abc.rar\nrun rarcrack abc.rar --threads <thread_num> --type rar\nProvide a numeric value instead of thread_num. This is number of threads. If you have multicore processor use it. A simple rule like, 2x no of core in your system. Like quad core i7, provide thread number as 8. Increasing this number to a greater value may cause system hang.\nOnce completed, started the rar crack will create an xml file  in same directory with current password. You can stop the tool and modify the xml to define the character set to be searched next time you run the tool.\nAs I told earlier, it takes long time to break a password. To check for a 5 character long  alpha-numaric password (no upper case), will take around 13 days if the tool process 50 keys/sec.\nMore technical details if you are interested - http://anrieff.net/ucbench/technical_qna.html\n", "Q: Ubuntu freezes at boot / many trouble installing Ubuntu 13.04 I have many trouble installing Ubuntu Gnome 13.04 (the same holds for Ubuntu 12.04) on my new desktop PC which I will describe in the following.\nHardware\n\n\n*\n\n*Processor: Intel Core i5-4570\n\n*Mainboard: Gigabyte GA-H87-HD3\n\n*RAM: 8GB G.Skill 1333MHz CL9\n\n*Graphics Card: Gigabyte GeForce GTX 660 OC\n\n*HDD: Seagate Barracuda 7200.14 1000GB\n\n\nProblems / what I have done so far\n\n\n*\n\n*I installed Ubuntu Gnome 13.04 next to my Windows 7 partition via Ubuntu live USB\n\n*\n\n*Problem: Grub did not load.

But my Mac can't boot off Mac OS X, so I can't fix it and install Ubuntu. What do I do?\n\nA: Any recent version of Ubuntu should not harm (or in any way modify) your Mac's EFI firmware. To give more details or absolute assurance about claims to the contrary, it would of course be necessary to detail and cite the claims (with a link if possible).\nHowever, what you're probably thinking of is this. Fortunately, that only affected Ubuntu 11.04 (which is not even supported anymore), and has been fixed (and the fix shipped with every subsequent version's installation images, starting with 11.10). Therefore, there is almost certainly no need to be concerned anymore (unless you're trying to install from old 11.04 images for some reason).\n\nThere is one significant Mac EFI related issue with Ubuntu, but it is not dangerous and doesn't pose a threat to your computer. Often a Mac is unable to boot a CD/DVD or live USB created from the regular Ubuntu ISO image because Macs are incompatible with boot media that are set up to work with both BIOS and UEFI (multi-catalog media).\nIf that's the problem you're having, the solution is to use the special Ubuntu disk image made for Macs. Macs can boot Mac EFI or regular BIOS, so this image removes UEFI support, and can be booted on Macs.\nThat critical, dangerous, and fortunately fixed bug used to be one of the reasons to make sure to use the special Mac image. Now that it's fixed, the special Mac image is still more likely to work than the regular one, but the regular image is not dangerous.\nSee this excellent answer for a detailed explanation and technical information about the difference between the regular and Mac ISO images.\nThis applies only to 64-bit ISO images, so if you're using the 32-bit image, then your problem is different.\nAssuming you're trying to install the 64-bit version of Ubuntu on your Mac, the special Mac ISO image for Ubuntu 12.04 LTS can be downloaded here.\n\n\n*\n\n*Specifically, here's a direct link to the ISO file.\n\n*And if you want to download via bittorrent, here's a link to the .torrent file.\n\n\nThat page also contains links to download the text-based alternate CD image, if you want that. (It shouldn't be necessary though, unless you have highly specialized requirements.)\nMore generally, for people looking for other versions: The special 64-bit Mac ISO images are currently kept on the cdimage.ubuntu.com download server, categorized by version. (In particular, images for 13.04, the latest stable release as of the time of this writing, are here.)\n\nA: Why don't you try \"VMWare Fusion\" & run Ubuntu as Virtual Machine ( VM ) in your mac.\nThere are restrictions for sure but its easy setup & you don't need to change anything in your beloved Mac. So chances of anything going wrong is Nill.\nThrough it gives you option to have only 1 GB RAM for the Ubuntu but its Super Fast.\nUbuntu Booting takes around 15/20 Seconds.\nResizing Windows are fast\nFull Screen is Good and support the Native Screen Resolution  ( Which Virtual Box don't )\nI have Win 8 installed as another VM and it too works like charm.\nCopy Paste from Mac works very well.\nI almost feel like I am working on a Linux Box. \nI have written a detailed Pros & Cons here\n", "Q: Ubuntu Desktop shifted to right I am using Ubuntu 12.04 (precise) Kernel : 3.5.0-18-generic\nI am encountering a strange problem, my whole desktop has shifted to right.

NOT USB drives.\nDuring my time using Ubuntu I have noticed that after updates, or sometimes vicariously at the whim of my system, my hard drives seem to change where they decide to mount in semi-random fashion.  This is wrecking havoc with my symlinks and is quite frankly getting very tiresome.  As I understand it 13.04 SHOULD mount my internal HDD at /media/[drive] and my removable drives at /media/[username]/[drive].  \nWell NOW suddenly my system has decided to mount ALL my drives at /media/[username]/[drive].  I used to be able to open the file manager and unmount them and when I remounted them they would 'fix' themselves and remount at /media/[drive].  I can no longer do that for some unknown reason.  My internal drives now INSIST on being mounted at /media/[username]/[drive].\nI have looked at my /ect/fstab and at the information in 'Disks' (see Is there a program to mount all of my drives automatically?) and none of it matches.  Also in 'Disks' my drives are set to mount automatically but they don't.  I always have to manually mount them.  \nTo fix that I found https://help.ubuntu.com/community/AutomaticallyMountPartitions.  Plus 'Disks' says that my disks are mounting at /mnt/[UUID] which they are not doing.\nI am now thoroughly confused.\nDo I use Disks OR fstab?  Do I put the automount in Disks or in the startup applications.  How do I get them to mount by UUID in the CORRECT location.  There are TOO many methods and none match and NONE seem to talk to one another.  Is there a definitive way, preferably with a GUI as I am not a CLI comfortable type, that I can use to fix this mess and get all my drives to automount on startup AND mount in the correct place CONSISTENTLY?  This is driving me nuts!\nHere is the info as per my system:\nfstab:\nproc            /proc           proc    nodev,noexec,nosuid 0       0\n\nUUID=68bff081-9b80-4d38-8383-8dcf9f77850c /               ext4    errors=remount-ro 0       1\n\nUUID=ada89abc-d3d6-4f5c-a4ed-176295a20842 none            swap    sw              0       0\n\n/dev/fd0        /media/floppy0  auto    rw,user,noauto,exec,utf8 0       0\n\nNow most of this is gibberish to me.

Now, lets start modifying your fstab. I will take this partition as example:\n/dev/sdd\nMount Point: /mnt/68787D0E787CDC6E\nIdentify As: /dev/disk/by-uuid/68787D0E787CDC6E\n\nblkid should returns something like:\n/dev/sdd1: UUID=\"68787D0E787CDC6E\" TYPE=\"ntfs\" \n\nIn your fstab you should write:\nUUID=68787D0E787CDC6E /media/some_directory               ntfs-3g    defaults,auto,users 0       0\n\n(in this case it will mount at boot)\nUUID=68787D0E787CDC6E /media/some_directory               ntfs-3g    defaults,noauto,users 0       0\n\n(in this case it will mount only when you select the drive)\nYou should modify the UUID and the /media/some_directory fields as you see fit. Hope this aleviates your problem.\nAbout the change of behavior, I don't found any problem with the layer. Maybe you hit a bug or something changed in your system.\n\nA: I found MountManager and that seems to help.  For some reason My USB drive INSISTS on mounting in the /media directory.  I give up.  I've no hair left to pull out so it can mount in Atlantis if it wants to.  Also of note MountManager sometimes gives dual mounting locations but only uses one and Nautilus insists on seeing both.

When I try to browse the network in Nautilus, I can see the windows box hostname (e.g. Browse Network > Windows Network > WORKGROUP > hostname), but I can't figure out how to find its IP!\nWhat's the best way?\nThanks.  \n\nA: Assuming the Windows machine is still accessible over the network, you can use a port scanning program to scan for the VNC server it's running. If host name discovery is not working, it's often faster and easier to scan your network for the running server than to troubleshoot it.\nThis may seem complicated at first, but port scanning soon becomes a very quick and easy way to get otherwise difficult-to-access information about what machines are on your network and what servers they are running.\nOne excellent network scanner that can be used for this is Nmap. To install Nmap in Ubuntu, open a Terminal window (Ctrl+Alt+T) and run:\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get install nmap\n\nNow, suppose for the sake of example-making that:\n\n\n*\n\n*Your local network's IP addresses all start with 192.168.1.. (You can check this by running ifconfig or, if you can access it, by looking in your router's web-based setup.)\n\n*The Windows box's VNC server is running on port 5900. (This is quite common, but not universal--you can tell it to listen on just about any port.)\n\n\nYou'll have to replace the above values with whatever actually applies to your situation.\nThen you can use Nmap to scan your LAN for the Windows box's VNC server by running:\nsudo nmap -sS -sV 192.168.1.\\* -p5900\n\n(Why does nmap have to be run as root with sudo? This enables it to perform scans using techniques that are faster, more efficient, and even less consuming of network resources. As root, it can perform actions that are really only useful for network-scanning and other similarly interesting applications, and thus not made available for normal applications running as limited users. However, if you don't want to run it as root, you don't have to; it will just be a little slower. In that case, replace -sS with -sT, and remove sudo from the beginning. See man nmap for details.)\nThis may display a result for all of your computers, but the one you're interested in is the one that says open in the STATE column. For example, it could look like:\nNmap scan report for 192.168.1.105\nHost is up (0.00011s latency).\nPORT     STATE SERVICE     VERSION\n5900/tcp open  vnc         ....\n\nI don't have a VNC server running on my LAN so I'm not sure that's exactly what it will look like (and the ... will certainly be replaced by information about the server software that is running). But that's essentially what it looks like.\nThe IP address on the line that says Nmap scan report, at the top of the entry that shows port 5900 (or whatever port it's using) as \"open,\" is the IP address of the Windows box.\nIf you prefer to use a graphical interface, then:\n\n\n*\n\n*You can install nmap in the Software Center. Install the zenmap package too; that's a graphical interface for nmap.\n\n*Then open Zenmap and do your scan from there.\nTo run Zenmap as root (see the note above about this, and the -sS vs. -sT flags), press Alt+F2 and run gksudo zenmap.\nIf you don't have gksudo (some 13.04 systems do and some do not), you can install it (it is provided by the gksu package), or you can open a Terminal and run sudo -H zenmap or sudo -i zenmap.\nYou should not run zenmap with straight sudo though, as you'd run a non-graphical program. That is, avoid sudo zenmap; running any but the most trivial graphical applications that way can cause annoying problems with an application's configuration files.\n\n*When you use Zenmap, you don't have to escape *s with a \\. That is, where you'd have something like 192.168.1.\\* in the Terminal, just use 192.168.1.* in Zenmap.\n\nScreenshot of Zenmap, showing a scan like what you may want to perform. On my network there are no VNC servers running, so nothing open is shown; just closed and filtered. On your network, you'd be looking for which IP has an open VNC port.\nAs you can probably see in the screenshot above, running Zenmap still involves composing an Nmap command, and in that way is command-line-like. But the output is shown graphically, and part of your command can be created automatically by using the interface provided.\n", "Q: How to disable Samba on Ubuntu 12.04?

I exclude directories from the list that are actually symbolic links ( [[ ! -L \"$d\" ]] ). You can remove this test if you need to include them and just keep the test for the directory.\nThis is an example for the $HOME directory, and I have added $HOME to the command, so the paths are now absolute, so you will be able to later run cd \"${cdarray[1]}\" as a separate command from any location and it will work. If you create it for another directory, just specify that absolute path instead of $HOME in the command below, unless of course you want it to work only relative to the directory in which it was created.\ncdarray=(); for d in *; do [[ ! -L \"$HOME/$d\" && -d \"$HOME/$d\" ]] && cdarray+=(\"$HOME/$d\"); done; cd \"${cdarray[1]}\"\n\nNow, any directories with spaces in their names will be handled successfully.\nThe indexed array is declared, and then if the found item is a directory and not a symlink, it is added to the array and then after the semi-colon we cd to the directory we want, e.g. cd \"${cdarray[1]}\".\nYou could add || exit 1 at the end if you used this in a script, but I didn't add that above as it would close the interactive terminal if the cd command failed.\n", "Q: Upstart job won't start I have a simple upstart job: - /etc/init/hmastart.conf \nI want to test it, so i run:-\nservice hmastart start\nBut i receive the following error:-\nstart: Unknown job: hmastart\nI get the same error message if i try:\nstart hmastart\nI have also tried adding sudo to the beginning, but i get the same error.\nHere is my script \ndescription \"Starts HMA VPN\"\nauthor \"Me <myself@i.com>\"\n\nstart on runlevel [2345]\n\nstop on runlevel [016]\n\nrespawn\n\nexpect fork\n\nexec sudo /usr/local/bin/hma-vpn -p tcp London\n\nMy conf file has the same permissions as all the other conf files in /etc/init.\nCould someone please tell me why this script cannot be found/run?\nMany thanks in advance!!`\n\nA: Your script should look like:\n# description \"Starts HMA VPN\"\n# author \"Me <myself@i.com>\"\n\nstart on runlevel [2345]\n\nstop on runlevel [016]\n\nrespawn\n\nexpect fork\n\nexec sudo /usr/local/bin/hma-vpn -p tcp London\n\nTo start it, use:\nsudo service hmastart start\n\n\nA: If your user doesn't have the NOPASSWD option configured for sudo then that could be why it's not starting as expected.

This should work.\nFor an encrypted connection--which is generally a good thing because the data you receive probably cannot be modified in transit by any malicious third party--you can try using https://. Thanks to Mitch for pointing this out. This worked for me, though it was considerably slower (it took almost half a minute instead of less than two seconds). Your mileage may vary.\nExplanation follows... (But if you want, you can stop reading here and just use that command.)\nYour corporate (or school) network might be preventing you from accessing the Git server.\nOn my Internet connection, I've checked to see if the IP address 204.232.175.90 has a server accepting incoming connections on port 9418. (After all, that is what it has to do, not what you have to do.) It does, though at that time (i.e., before I tried cloning the repo myself) it was not clear to me if what's running on that port is actually a Git server:\nek@Kip:~$ sudo nmap -sS -sV -p9418 204.232.175.90\n[sudo] password for ek:\n\nStarting Nmap 6.00 ( http://nmap.org ) at 2013-08-16 09:25 EDT\nNmap scan report for github.com (204.232.175.90)\nHost is up (0.046s latency).\nPORT     STATE SERVICE VERSION\n9418/tcp open  domain  ISC BIND   Email support\n\nService detection performed. Please report any incorrect results at http://nmap.org/submit/ .\nNmap done: 1 IP address (1 host up) scanned in 7.82 seconds\n\nEven if that had been something other than a Git server, you should still not have gotten \"connection refused\". If you get the same error when you try again, something is blocking your ability to connect to that server. If possible, I recommend consulting your network administrator. After all, you should ideally be able to access that server. And most network administrators are probably not going to have a problem with you accessing Git repositories.\nHowever, there is an easy workaround.\nFor people in your situation, and other situations where only HTTP access is possible (for example, people whose only access to the Internet is through an HTTP proxy), Git provides the ability to access repositories with HTTP (i.e., via the web)!\nI don't mean that you'd browse the web to clone the repository. The git command is itself capable of connecting over HTTP, as an alternative to using Git's own application layer protocol.\nTo do this, replace git:// with http:// in the URL given to the git command.\nFrom your perspective as a user, this works exactly the same way. The only difference you may notice (besides that this way should work!) is that it may be slower, since HTTP is less well-suited to accessing Git repositories than Git's own protocol.\nThat can be an issue over time, or for huge repositories. That's why I recommend contacting your network administrator. But in this case, there should be no problems; the repository appears small. (Even if it were large, increased wait times are sometimes acceptable. It's when you have to transfer a lot of data, many times per day, that it can become burdensome to your workflow.)\nIt's possible for a Git server not to offer HTTP access, but in practice that is rare, and I have tested this one, and it does provide it, and I was able to clone the repository:\nek@Kip:~/src$ git clone http://github.com/schacon/ticgit.git\nCloning into 'ticgit'...\nremote: Counting objects: 1857, done.\nremote: Compressing objects: 100% (1022/1022), done.\nremote: Total 1857 (delta 781), reused 1787 (delta 735)\nReceiving objects: 100% (1857/1857), 374.78 KiB | 702 KiB/s, done.\nResolving deltas: 100% (781/781), done.\nek@Kip:~/src$ ls ticgit                # you don't have to run this\nbin       lib          LICENSE_MIT  Rakefile    spec               TODO\nexamples  LICENSE_GPL  note         README.mkd  ticgit-ng.gemspec\nek@Kip:~/src$ du -sh ticgit            # you don't have to run this\n844K    ticgit\n\nI also did it with git:// and got the same results. HTTP access works fine for this repository.\nAs stated above, https:// worked fine for me too, though it was much slower.

I thought about uninstalling it and reinstalling it, but I don't have a clue about how to do that. Can anyone help me?\n\nA: Just entering the following in my terminal on Ubuntu Trusty Tahr worked fine for me for upgrading.\nsudo apt-get install firefox\n\n\nA: Quit Firefox Effectively\nFirst make sure Firefox is not running:\nps ax | grep [f]irefox\n\nIf it is running, quit it. If it doesn't appear to be running but appears in the list from ps ax, kill it by running killall firefox, waiting a few seconds, then running killall -KILL firefox. If you don't see firefox: no process found after the second killall command, run that second command again. If you still don't see it, reboot (or you may want to try running it with sudo too, thought that won't usually help).\nConsider Clearing Your Profile\nIf you want to clear out your profile (which can fix many problems, especially problems relating to upgrading Firefox to a new version), then rename the folder called .mozilla that resides in your home folder. There's two ways to do this:\n\n\n*\n\n*In Nautilus (the GUI file browser): Press Ctrl+H or click View → Show Hidden Files. Then you can see files and folders that start with a .. Go to your home folder if you're not already there, and rename .mozilla to .mozilla.old (or whatever you want to call it).\n\n*On the command-line: Open a Terminal window (Ctrl+Alt+T) and run the command:\nmv ~/.mozilla ~/.mozilla.old\n\n(Or put whatever you want to call it, in place of .mozilla.old.)\nThe idea behind renaming the folder instead of deleting it is so you can restore it. But if its contents are keeping Firefox (or a recently installed newer version of Firefox) from working, then you may have trouble actually using them later!\nTherefore, if there's anything you want to save--often, this will be your bookmarks--you should back that up first, before you do this. (This article may help with that.)\nFinally, note that I'm certainly not advocating clearing your profile regularly, or even every time you upgrade Firefox. It's only when you have severe problems after upgrading that I recommend trying it. (If it makes no difference, you can rename .mozilla.old back to .mozilla--you may have to remove a newly created .mozilla first. That's one of the reasons to back up the whole profile.)\nReinstall Firefox (from the latest version in any of your software sources)\nTo reinstall Firefox, removing global configuration files and getting the latest version available in any of the software sources configured on your Ubuntu system, run:\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get --purge --reinstall install firefox\n\nShould apt-get upgrade be run too?\nRunning sudo apt-get upgrade is not necessary for getting the latest available Firefox, because the install command will automatically fetch and install or upgrade to the latest installable version, and whatever other packages (if any) are needed to enable that version to install.\nWith that said, it's reasonable to run sudo apt-get upgrade in this situation. You may want to bring all your software up to date, and that can even potentially help with some interoperability problems. (New versions of some packages and really old versions of others have not necessarily been tested together, after all.)\nIf you're accustomed to using the Software Updater (Update Manager in older Ubuntu releases), go ahead and do that. If you prefer to use the command-line:\nsudo apt-get upgrade\nsudo apt-get dist-upgrade\n\nOf course, if you haven't run sudo apt-get update shortly before running those, you should do that. And sudo apt-get dist-upgrade will upgrade packages that require the installation of new packages or removal of currently installed packages, so you should make sure to look at what it says it plans to do, before letting it proceed.\n(To address a common confusion: dist-upgrade does not attempt to upgrade your Ubuntu system to a later Ubuntu release, though on some other OSes it's used for that purpose in combination with manually editing a configuration file. See this explanation of dist-upgrade. Running sudo apt-get update, sudo apt-get upgrade, and sudo apt-get dist-upgrade in that order approximates the behavior of the Software Updater / Update Manager and tends to work well.)\n\nA: If you use Ubuntu, you can use the following commands:\nsudo apt-get purge firefox\nmv ~/.mozilla ~/mozilla-backup\nsudo apt-get install firefox\n\nThese commands will remove Firefox and your Firefox profile data and install again Firefox.\nTo update Firefox to the last version using:\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get upgrade\n\nsudo apt-get upgrade is used to install the newest versions of all packages currently installed on the system from the sources enumerated in /etc/apt/sources.list.\n\nA: I installed Firefox and repeatedly got an error when I attempted to open it. \n\n(process:2705): GLib-CRITICAL **: g_slice_set_config: assertion 'sys_page_size == 0' failed\n  Error: Access was denied while trying to open files in your profile directory.\n\nInitially, I could only run firefox by typing sudo firefox--far from ideal.

I can not control the brightness of the screen using Fn+left and Fn+right keys. I tried to change brightness from \"Brightness and Lock\" settings, bit still it does not work. Brightness control bar moves, but brightness does not actually change. \nOther people have modified the file /etc/default/grub for other Acer models. But that solution does not work for me.\nAny advise will be of much help.\nThank you.\n\nA: If your Acer Aspire V5 uses intel_backlight device instead of acpi_video0, then this set of scripts might provide a solution to you. See if you have intel_backlight device by examining the output of \"ls -l /sys/class/backlight\". To determine if your notebook responds to brightness commands on the intel_backlight device, start a root shell by executing \"sudo -i\" and then do this in the root shell:\n\n*\n\n*Determine your maximum brightness:\n\ncat /sys/class/backlight/intel_backlight/max_brightness\n\n\n\n*Decrease brightness to a desired value, for example to half of the maximum brightness value (substitute 500 with your value):\n\necho 500 > /sys/class/backlight/intel_backlight/brightness\n\n\n\n*If your brightness has decreased, then use the above set of scripts to fix the problem with your brightness control hotkeys.\nFinally, see how many steps you have for brightness control. If you completely decrease or increase brightness in about 5 key presses, then you should make one additional correction to your configs so that you have 10 steps to regulate brightness, as originally designed.\nIn your root shell, execute:\n\ncat /sys/module/video/parameters/brightness_switch_enabled\n\nIf you see 'Y' or '1', run the following command:\n\necho 'N' > /sys/module/video/parameters/brightness_switch_enabled\n\nReplace 'N' with '0' if you received '1' as an output from the previous command. After that, you should have 10 steps for brightness control instead of 5.\n\nA: In most computer you can set the brightness by echoing directly in /sys/class/backlight/acpi_video0/brightness in a terminal, e.g.\n# echo <value> > /sys/class/backlight/acpi_video0/brightness\n\nwhere value can vary from 0 to 15. Problem is, you need to run this as root, as the file you will edit is in the /sys/ directory.\n\nA: I can testify that the answer marked as solution on How to control Brightness on Acer Laptop works with Ubuntu GNOME 13.04 on an Acer Aspire V5-571P with Intel HD4000 graphics, reported as Ivybridge Mobile by Ubuntu's System Settings > Details... but then, I know there are other V5's around so YMMV.\n", "Q: How can I check the information of currently installed WiFi drivers?

(Acer c7 320GB HDD) First of all I am a brand-newbie to linux/ubuntu. Second, I have searched on my own for a way to do this for 4 hours and just can't quite find it or find it explained the right way. I apologize if this is a duplicate or a difficulty 1/100 for any basic linux/ubuntu user. \nThat being said, here is my setup: I am running Xubuntu 12.04 alongside ChromeOS via \"crouton\" on an Acer c7 Chromebook. It's a fresh install from yesterday (the xubuntu that is). I've managed to figure out the launcher, and the apt-get and ppa repository and that stuff... for the most part. I got a few basic programs - FireFox, Skype, VLC, Audacious, and qBittorrent. So now I'm ready to download some videos and music and I arrived at my problem.\nThe problem is I am (very) quickly running out of space (660 MB remaining). Thing is it's a 320 GB HDD and I have a 311 GB drive sitting greyed out on my desktop. When I try right-clicking and mounting, I get this:\n\nClick for large size.\nSo I went in sudo fdisk -l and it promptly told me that /dev/sda was a GPT and fdisk could not format it, and I needed to get GNU Parted. So I tried simply \"sudo apt-get install parted\" and sure enough it grabbed GNU Parted 2.3. Here is what (parted) print returned for me:\n\nClick for large size.\nSo my question is how can I get this 311 GB of space working for me as storage? To be clear it's just a partition on my internal 320 GB HDD that came with my Acer c7 chromebook. Do I need to mount it somehow or could I somehow change one of the other existing partitions to just be bigger? \nAgain I apologize for my level of noviceness and any help is much appreciated!\n\nA: For a partition or internal hard disk to be accessible in ubuntu it has to be 'mounted'. You can mount partitions manually or automatically.\nTo mount them manually:\n\n*\n\n*Find out the name of the partition you want to mount. I find it easy to use gparted\nsudo apt-get install gparted). You can run sudo gparted in the commandline. Be careful not to mess anything up. Then you write down the name of the partition you want to mount (for instance sda2).\n\n\n*Now you need to create a mounting point. That is a point in your filesystem at which the partition will be accessible. It is not actually at that point, it just accessible at that point. You can create a directory for this. For instance, mkdir /media/extra_drive. Usually you would make this in the media directory which is also where usb sticks will be mounted. Media is usually used for mounts for a particular user (not systemwide, then you'd use mnt).\n\n\n*Now you can mount the partition using\n  sudo mount /dev/sda2 /media/extra_drive\n\n\n\n*This can be unmounted manually using sudo umount /media/extra_drive. The mount is not boot-persistent and you will have to do it on each reboot.\nMounting it on every boot is not handy, therefore you should mount it automatically. To mount it automatically on each boot you have to add it to your fstab file. There is a nice wiki for that, so I will not repeat all the info here unless it is unclear. Essentially you find the UUID (ls -al /dev/disk/by-uuid/) and then do the following:\n\n\n*\n\n*Duplicate your fstab file:\n sudo cp /etc/fstab /etc/fstab.$(date +%Y-%m-%d)\n\n\n\n*Compare the two files to confirm the backup matches the original:\n cmp /etc/fstab /etc/fstab.$(date +%Y-%m-%d)\n\n\n\n*Open the original fstab in a text editor:\n gksu gedit /etc/fstab \n\nand add these lines into it\n    # (identifier)  (location, eg sda5)   (format, eg ext3 or ext4)      (some settings) \n    UUID=????????   /media/dir_of_your_choice    ext4          defaults       0       2 \n\n\nWhether you mount it manually or automatically, the partition as such does not add itself to your home folder (which will thus remain low on space). So you will have to put files on that partition manually if you want to be able to work on as you do now. Even better would be to give your /home directory its own partition. For more info on that (which requires a bit of reading and work), cf. this nice wiki page. Depending on the size of your home partition your +-300GB partition would make for a nice home folder. The biggest advantage of your home folder is that you reinstall ubuntu without losing your files (if you know what you are doing and can do the install such that the home partition is untouched).\n", "Q: What does \"Run command as a login shell\" do? I have a few separate programs installed, some of which require me to go into my GUI terminal settings and enable/disable the \"Run command as a login shell\" option to get either working.\nExample:\nI installed Ruby on Rails. Unfortunately I have to go into the terminal options and enable \"Run command as login shell\" for it to be in my PATH.\nThis wasn't too much of an issue up until I installed sexy-bash-prompt, which works only if the option is disabled.\nSo my question is essentially: what does \"Run command as login shell\" do? Is there a way to get the things that run when it's disabled to run when you do run as login shell?\n\nA: Assuming that your shell is Bash (the default in Ubuntu), these are the differences:\n\n\n*\n\n*When running as a login shell, Bash will read ~/.bash_profile (or, if that doesn't exist, ~/.profile) on startup. In some cases, this file reads ~/.bashrc as well.\n\n*When running as a non-login shell, Bash will read ~/.bashrc.\nSo, why do you see different behaviors when running as a login/non-login shell? Because your .bash_profile/.profile is doing different things than your .bashrc.\nThe solution I would recommend in your case is to copy the customizations made to .bash_profile/.profile, paste them into .bashrc and disable \"Run command as a login shell\".\n", "Q: Turtle Beach X12 HeadSet Mic Not Working?

There are only complicated and ineffective ways. The result has slow performance and the meaning of the expression is obscured.\nSingle command combination of the three greps\nIf you just want to run a single command you can use awk which works with regular expressions too and can combine them with logical operators. Here is the equivalent of your filter:\nawk '/a/ && /c/ && $0 !~ /d/'\n\nI think in most cases there is no reason for simplifying a pipe to a single command except when the combination results in a realatively simple grep expression which could be faster (see results below).\nUnix-like systems are designed to use pipes and to connect various utilities together. Though the pipe communication is not the most effective possible but in most cases it is sufficient. Because nowadays most of new computers have multiple CPU cores you can \"naturally\" utilize CPU parallelization just by using a pipe!\nYour original filter works very well and I think that in many cases the awk solution would be a little bit slower even on a single core.\nPerformance comparison\nUsing a simple program I have generated a random testing file with 200 000 000 lines, each with 4 characters as a random combination from characters a, b, c and d. The file has 1 GB. During the tests it was completely loaded in the cache so no disk operations affected the performance measurement. The tests were run on Intel dual core.\nSingle grep\n$ time ( grep -E '^[^d]*a[^d]*c[^d]*$|^[^d]*c[^d]*a[^d]*$' testfile >/dev/null )\nreal    3m2.752s\nuser    3m2.411s\nsys 0m0.252s\n\nSingle awk\n$ time ( awk '/a/ && /c/ && $0 !~ /d/' testfile >/dev/null )\nreal    0m54.088s\nuser    0m53.755s\nsys 0m0.304s\n\nThe original three greps piped\n$ time ( grep a testfile | grep c | grep -v d >/dev/null )\nreal    0m28.794s\nuser    0m52.715s\nsys 0m1.072s\n\nHybrid - positive greps combined, negative piped\n$ time ( grep -E 'a.*c|c.*a' testfile | grep -v d >/dev/null )\nreal    0m15.838s\nuser    0m24.998s\nsys 0m0.676s\n\nHere you see that the single grep is very slow because of the complex expression. The original pipe of three greps is pretty fast because of a good parallelization. Without parallelization - on a single core - the original pipe runs just slightly faster than awk which as a single process is not parallelized. Awk and grep probably use the same regular expressions code and the logic of the two solutions is similar.\nThe clear winner is the hybring combining two positive greps and leaving the negative one in the pipe. It seems that the regular expression with | has no performance penalty.\n\nA: The problem is that -e works as an or, not as an and. You can do it in one line, but it's pretty convoluted. The not part is the most complicated.\nTo simplify the a and c parts (assuming order is unknown):\ngrep -E 'a.*c|c.*a'\n\nor\ngrep -e 'a.*c' -e 'c.*a'\n\nHence, you could do\ngrep -E 'a.*c|c.*a' | grep -v 'd'\n\nFor a single grep statement, you'll have to make sure there are no ds before, after or between the a and c:\ngrep -E '^[^d]*a[^d]*c[^d]*$|^[^d]*c[^d]*a[^d]*$'\n\n\nA: You can use the -xswitch, which acording to the grep man page, \"select  only  those  matches that exactly match the whole line.\".\nIn your exemple, try : grep -x \"a b c\"\n", "Q: How to turn off keyboard backlight of and Alienware M14X laptop OK, I have an Alienware M14X and the keyboard backlight is always on and I can't turn it off...

Does anyone know of a music player that supports the ipod nano 7g? I know amarok doesn't, and I haven't had any success playing around with rhythm box or banshee. Any suggestions for how to get these or other players to work would be wonderful!\n\nA: Apparently Apple changed the FS type in the more recent iPods, e.g. Nano 7G, so that it is not compatible with gtkpod which is the engine for many of the Linux based players. The link below outlines a workaround to the issue.

I call these \"system\" Python packages.\nI also do a lot of scientific work with Python and so I have installed tools like numpy, matplotlib, etc. using pip -- these live in /usr/local/lib/python2.7 and are owned by me (I chowned /usr/local because I'm the only user on this machine). I call these \"local\" Python packages. I put the local path in front of the system one in my PYTHONPATH so that I load local packages preferentially.\nNow, I'm trying to upgrade one of the local packages that I installed using pip, and pip is failing because it wants to uninstall a dependent system package as part of the upgrade process.\nI have two questions about this, addressing the problem from each end :\nOne way to fix this problem is to get pip to upgrade my local packages and ignore the system-installed ones (if possible). Can I prevent pip from trying to uninstall a system package during a local package upgrade, but only for one dependency ?\nAnother way would be to have pip install a newer version of the package, and then use that version to satisfy dependencies in apt related tools. Is there a way to tell Ubuntu that a pip-installed package will satisfy an apt dependency ?\n(I am familiar with virtualenv, but on this machine I only ever use this one environment, so I'd really like to avoid keeping track of whether I'm working in the correct virtualenv.)\n\nA: If you do not want pip to install or uninstall any dependencies you can use\npip install --no-deps package_name\n\nBe ware that you are in that case responsible for making sure the different dependencies needed for the package you install are satisfied.\nTo use it when upgrading a package use:\npip install -U --no-deps package_name\n\nFor a similar problem, cf. Drag forward installed Python packages when upgrading\n", "Q: /var/www owner for apache2 and ftp access I've got apache2 running on Ubuntu Server 12.04 LTS on an old laptop. It's on my local network to act as a webserver to help me learn PHP (and linux).\nThe default owner for the /var/www folder (where the webpages for apache are stored) is www-data. With the owner set to www-data I can't copy files/folders to that folder over ftp. If I change the owner of the /var/www folder to james (my ftp user) then I can move files over ftp but apache doesn't have access to display any pages or sub folders.\nWhat should the correct owner be to allow access for ftp user james and apache?\n\nA: I'd recommend setting it to be owned by james:james.\nAlternatively, you could leave it as root:root and requite sudo for anybody deploying files in there, but if you are directly working in the /var/www directory (rather than working somewhere else and pushing the files there) that may not be convenient, and it won't work with FTP either.\nYou can set the owner of /var/www to whatever you like, as long as the www-data user has read access.  You can achieve this by setting permissions to allow world read access (as is default).\nBy default, it is owned by root:root (not www-data as you state in the question).\n\n*\n\n*For security, it is not a good idea to set it to be owned by www-data.  www-data is intended to be an unprivileged account which cannot write to any files, and can only read them.\nYes, occasionally you may need to give www-data the permission to write to a given file, but for security this should be strictly limited to those particular files, and precautions should be taken such as making sure no such files are executable as scripts by the web server (ie they are not in a location where they may be interpreted as PHP or CGI files), etc.\n\n\n*For security, it is an even worse idea to set the file permissions to world-writable (eg, 777).  Unprivileged users such as www-data should not be able to write to files in this directory.  The only people who need write access will be the people who are actually writing files in there.\n\n\n*The /var/www directory is intended to be yours to do with what you like.  It makes sense to set ownership to whichever account will be editing the files.  You can create a group for this purpose if you have multiple people, but in this case it's just you.\nNote: if creating a group, create a new group.  Do not re-use the www-data group as that is intended to be an unprivileged group without write access to any files (as I explain above).\n\nToo often I see people recommending adopting very bad security practices such as setting /var/www to be owned by www-data, or adding people to the www-data group in order to give that group editing privileges, or setting /var/www to be world-writable (eg 777).  By doing any of this you are potentially opening yourself up to significant security problems.\n\nA: The ideal permission is to make yourself the owner and the www-data the group, set youself as the owner of files by sudo chown -R yourname:www-data /var/www/public_html/ and sudo chmod -R g+w /var/www/public_html/ make sure you change the directory and username appropriately. You will be able to write files and apache processes wont be hindered. I am suggesting this as the OP is running a local instance of APACHE for practice purpose and will be using lots of scripts or opensource scripts like wordpress, etc, that will require write access. Here security is not a prime concern as the local server will not be using a public ip and ease of installing, copying and running scripts is of prime importance. The OP can focus on learning PHP rather than administering the server.\n", "Q: How to restore grub after deleting it from Windows 8 disk manager? I deleted 2 partitions from Windows 8 disk manager.

The ubuntu installation CD does not help either.  Does anyone have any idea to resolve this problem?\n\nA: You can use Boot Repair\nJust boot from the Ubuntu LiveCD, and once it boots up, just press Ctrl+Alt+T on your keyboard to open Terminal. When it opens, run the command(s) below:\nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:yannubuntu/boot-repair\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get install -y boot-repair && boot-repair\n\nRun Boot Repair once the installation is done.\nSource:Boot Repair\n", "Q: Permission denied using dd to clone main drive So I'm trying to clone the setup of one computer to 4 identical machines on the same network.

Okay so I'm trying to format my hdd to ntfs on Ubuntu 13.04  and it gives me two options, Don't overwrite existing data(Quick), and Overwrite existing data with zeroes(Slow). What does it mean to overwrite the existing data with zeroes? I plan on installing windows 7 but it says my  hdd must be in NTFS format. Please help me with this.Thanks in advance.\n\nA: The overwrite with 0's will literally write #FFFFFF to every sector on the harddrive, permanently erasing the data that was there.  This is a technique used to remove all data fragments which might be left on the drive.  It's usually used when pernicious malware is expected or as part of a data-wipe routine.\nChances are, you just need the quick option.\n\nA: If it is SSD, you only need to overwrite it once for security since it is not magnetic. Overwriting it several times is bad for SSD's. Also, use MBR then NTFS if you plan to install windows.

As a dedicated Ubuntu server or as a VPS, I am looking for a web control panel, something like cPanel which is something like a web administrator for a server.\nI have not used any on Linux since I do everything through the terminal, but still want to know what I can use in the case I have to recommend Ubuntu Server with such an application installed.\n\nA: Here is a list of free and paid control panels that are available for Ubuntu server\n\nFree CPanel Alternatives\nweb://cp \nweb://cp was where it all seems to have started for much of the open\n  source world. It was written in php and the aim of it's single\n  developer was to make a good quality control panel. \nweb-cp is an Open Source solution taking up the torch where web://cp\n  stopped and is a direct continuation of that project. Like the\n  original this is written in php and so should put little additional\n  stress on a server. This might be good for you if your server is a\n  little lacking in the power needed to run piles of additional\n  software.\nFlexCP\nFlexCP is an Open Source solution and so is likely to improve in\n  proportion to the number of users. It can be obtained under the GNU\n  GPL version 2 from sourceforge.net. It is a redevelopment of\n  \"web://cp\" and as of writing had not released any file packages. \nCube Panel Lite\nThis is the stripped down version of the non-free Cube Panel. Being\n  closed source there is a lot less that can be easily researched on the\n  subject. I can however tell you that you will be limited to one server\n  and 30 domains. After that yo will be looking for an upgrade or\n  another free alternative.\nVHCS\nVHCS is an open source solution released under the Mozilla Public\n  License 1.1 (MPL 1.1) and it appears to be a live and ready to go open\n  source solution. For mission critical servers this might be the choice\n  of system for this reason only. It is a sourceforge.net project so\n  downloading should be simple even if installation is not.\nAnd of course\nWebmin\nWebmin is a free and impressive looking suit of control panel\n  packages. It is free and open source solution licensed under the BSD\n  License according to sourceforge.net. Much like the Fedora and Red Hat\n  relationship there is a non-free version too. The GNU GPL is also used\n  which is a bit confusing for the fussy.\nNon-Free CPanel Alternatives\nPlesk\nAfter CPanel this is possibly the next biggest system used. \nCube Panel\nWhile \"not at all\" playing off the CPanel naming this is a\n  commercially viable package. Like CPanel there are three levels of\n  management allowing for reseller accounts but also like CPanel you are\n  going to pay for this. The key advantage here is that you an get a\n  free 20 day trail version to test out prior to purchase. You may also\n  find that the \"lite\" version has everything you need.\nEnsim pro \nDirect Admin\nWhile \"not a free offering\" the lifetime unlimited license is a mere\n  US$299 which, right now, is arround UK£147 (give or take a bit). This\n  comes with 90 days of support which should be enough to get you up and\n  running. Alternatively you can pay by the month for ongoing support.\nVirtualmin Pro\nThe pay for, super \"pro\" version of webmin's virtualmin for those that\n  want all the power. The webmin site says \"Both the Pro and GPL\n  versions are built from the same codebase, so all bugfixes and some\n  new features go into both of them.\"\nVHCS Pro\nServerPilot\nServerPilot is a SaaS control panel for developers hosting their\n  websites on Ubuntu servers.

I downloaded the LINUX drivers for the printer from the Epson Website, and used the PPD to install. Returns a CUPS error. Installed the printer via localhost:631. It installed, but said it was missing a filter. Any ideas on how to get all the files where they need to be? Thanks!\n\nA: I had the same problem with my Epson WF-3520 and the driver from the Epson-Website. This solved my problem:\nTry, to make sure the damaged driver will be removed:\nsudo apt-get -f install\n\nAnd then install the driver from the package manager\nsudo apt-get install printer-driver-escpr\n\nI installed the package \"printer-driver-escpr\" version 1.3.0-1 with the package manager and the driver works for me with the Epson WF-3520.\nNow, try to add a new printer.\nApplication -> System Tools -> System Settings -> Printers\n\nNetwork priner with connection type:\nLPD/LPR queue 'PASSTHRU'\n\n\nA: I had a similar problem trying to install Epson WF-3520 on my Ubuntu 14.04 system. I think these general steps can be followed for any distribution of Linux. Many drivers are automatically recognized by Ubuntu when you configure your printer with your computer system (see step 5 below), but if your printer that is not automatically recognized by Ubuntu, then these steps should help. I followed the instructions found on this page: https://wiki.linuxfoundation.org/en/OpenPrinting/Database/DriverPackages and this is what I did:\n\n\n*\n\n*Open Synaptic Package Manager and search for lsb. Mark the box next to the lsb package for installation and click the Apply button to install it. A bunch of other packages will also be installed with the lsb package and that is okay.\n\n*Go to Epson's Download driver's and Software site: http://download.ebz.epson.net/dsc/search/01/search/. Search for your printer (wf-3520) and your operating system (Linux).\n\n*Click the Download button next to the ESC/P Driver (full feature) Printer Driver. Click Accept and then download the driver for your computer system. For example, my computer has an AMD 64-bit processor with Ubuntu 64-bit, so I would download the driver that ends with amd64.deb. (In case you didn't know, Ubuntu uses .deb packages.) This driver should open in the Ubuntu Software Center by default, so you may have to close out Synaptic before you try to install the driver, but maybe not. Click the Install button to install the driver.\n\n*If you do not already have the dpkg package installed, then open Synaptic again, search for dpkg and install it the same way you did with the lsb package above. By the way, dpkg is the Debian package management system, so you should already have it installed on your system. But in case it is not, you can install it as I have explained.\n\n*Now you need to configure your printer so your computer will recognize it. Turn on your printer and connect the USB plug from your printer to your computer. Click your Ubuntu button (the same one you click to shut down your computer) --> System Settings --> Printers --> Add. You should see your printer as one of the options to add. Select your printer and follow the prompts to add your printer. The default settings that are pre-filled should all work, so you can just use those settings.\n\n*That's it! You should be set now. You should run a test page to make sure that everything worked. In the System Settings dialog box, click Printers --> double-click your printer in the Printers dialog box and click Print Test Page. If everything was set up correctly, then your printer should print a test page.\n\n\nI hope that helps. \nHappy printing!\n", "Q: What is the best Ubuntu version for my hp tc4200 netbook? Which version of Ubuntu should I load on my laptop which has 768 MB RAM and just 40 GB hard drive space so that it runs smoothly and looks nice?\n\nA: The best Ubuntu variant for your system would be Lubuntu or Xubuntu. Xubuntu will do OK on that system (suggested specs), and it has a lot of nice features. Lubuntu will run even smoother (suggested specs), but it is more simplistic.\nIf you want even better performance but not-as-good support and software updates, you can try another distro such as SliTaz. I recommend Lubuntu and Slitaz to any user who needs a lightweight desktop. I dual boot SliTaz with Firefox, Flash, and Java downloaded from their respective websites, and Lubuntu, on an old Dell laptop and Slitaz runs like a beast, and Lubuntu huffs along to catch up but still does pretty well.\nLubuntu has no LTS version, but you can choose between 12.04 LTS and 13.04 with Xubuntu. If you're concerned about stability, then you have the option of receiving software updates for an extra year and a half with Xubuntu 12.04 LTS, but I recommend going with the latest release because it is better software and it's easy to upgrade as long as you have hardware that's well supported by the kernel.\n", "Q: Installing Ubuntu 13.04 on Ideapad u510 after deleting all partitions Here is my problem.  I purchased a lenovo ideapad u510.  I switched the boot mode to legacy, started the ubuntu live cd (via usb), deleted all partions on the 24gb ssd as well as the 500gb hdd and started installing ubuntu.  That's what I always do, because I like to start with fresh partition tables when I install an operating system.  But this time I ran into serious trouble.  The hdd just doesn't play along.  For some reason I had to install everything on /dev/sda, which is the 24gb ssd.  I did create a partition on /dev/sdb (for /home) but couldn't use it.  I don't remember what the problem was.\nWell, the installation was successful.  Since than a message kept popping up all the time, telling me about a defect hard drive.  I deleted from /dev/sdb1 (partition on the 500gb hdd) and the message didn't show up anymore.  But still, I am stuck with a system of just 24gb in total of external memory, although there is a 500gb hard drive in that machine.  It is there in /dev/ as /dev/sdb, but gparted /dev/sdb now gives me the message \"Error opening /dev/sdb: no medium found\".\nApparently the ssd and hdd are supposed to work together in some kind of raid-like fashion.  Unfortunately I screwed that up when I deleted all the original partitions.  I know nothing about this stuff and Ubuntu doesn't either.  Does anyone know how to fix this?  i just want to have Ubuntu on that machine and be able to use both disks.\n\nA: Solved.\nThe hdd did not work because the sata cable was not properly connected to the board.  I must have ripped it out while replacing the hdd.  I did not mention that I replaced it to see if maybe that is the problem.  The little plug was just halfway connected, that is why the system could see /dev/sdb but not access it.\nSo basically the only important thing is to disable intel rapid start in bios setup.  After that, the ssd and hdd are just two regular devices and ubuntu can be installed and used as usual.\n", "Q: virtual box error after reinstallation of 12.04 64bit i was trying to uninstall wine, but the command i got from this site destroyed my ubuntu machine. the command was \"sudo apt-get remove wine*\" or --purge in place of remove would do same thing. it uninstalled everything. luckly i had everything on an external hdd.\nso i reinstalled 12.04 64bit. started up virtual box, made a virtual machine for 12.04 32bit.

How do I setup windows samba sharing on my second hard drive so that all users can create and delete files in Unity?  I need to setup samba with admin privileges.\n\nA: Your question is quite unclear. Specify what systems do you have, and what exactly you want to achieve. Is that share on windows? (btw. you can't have samba share on windows.. windows shares are smb (or other) and samba speaks smb protocol so in IT world you need to be really specific).

Unity is windows manager, it can't create and delete files on its own. \nI guess you want to mount windows share in ubuntu, and to do that you use mount command. f.e \nsudo mount -t \"filesystemname\" \\ip.ip.ip.ip\\nameofshare \\mnt\\mountpoint \ntake a look here:\nhttp://manpages.ubuntu.com/manpages/hardy/en/man8/mount.8.html\nas for privileges in ubuntu you need to read this: \nhttp://linuxcommand.org/lts0070.php\nand maybe this, \nhttp://manpages.ubuntu.com/manpages/hardy/en/man1/chmod.1.html\n", "Q: Does a sidebar like Google Desktop sidebar exist for Ubuntu?

I've been looking online for the location of the xml file that says how often the wallpaper changes and I can't find it, anyone know where it is? Or what time the wallpaper changes? It's really bugging me that I don't know :)\n\nA: The changing version of the standard gnome 3 wallpaper changes with the time of day. In the morning, it is light, and it gets darker over the day.\nLike edwin said, you can find all of the wallpapers (the different light / dark versions of the gnome 3 wallpaper and all other standard wallpapers) in /usr/share/backgrounds/\nEDIT: It seems that the standard wallpaper is more than just images changing at a special time. It is the only changing wallpaper in the standard configuration that uses transitions, at least in my gnome version (3.8). I could imagine that this isn't the case in 3.4, but at least some parts of the following should also apply to gnome 3.4:\nThe configuration files for the changing backgrounds are located in /usr/share/gnome-background-properties/ and for the Adwaita standard theme it redirects to another config file: /usr/share/themes/Adwaita/backgrounds/adwaita-timed.xml. You also find the three wallpapers between which the transition happens in the same folder as the config file.\n", "Q: SSH and SCP help I'm a university student, and very new to ssh and scp... and new to programming. The newest assignment given to us requires accessing libraries that are only on the student server at university. To work at home, they said to use SSH.\nSo I've done that, and I can use ssh to log on to the student server, so that I can compile using the libraries stored there (C++ programming) \nHowever, I'm not sure how to do either:\n\n\n*\n\n*compile the files on my local computer in the student log-in terminal. OR\n\n*use scp to copy the files I'm working on to my @student folder, so that I can then compile while logged in.\n\n\nwith regards to b) I've tried the following command:\nscp mike@ubuntu: /a1644923/testscp a1644923@uss.cs.adelaide.edu.au: a1644923\n\nbut then I get:\nssh: connect to host ubuntu port 22: Connection refused\ncp: cannot stat `/a1644923/testscp': No such file or directory\na1644923@uss.cs.adelaide.edu.au's password:\n\n\nA: The sensible thing to do is to copy the files from your home computer to the student server. (What you tried in the second step)\nscp requires two parameters: source and destination, and only the remote part needs username@hostname.\nSo your command (for one file for testing) should read:\nscp a1644923/testscp a1644923@uss.cs.adelaide.edu.au:\n\nThe colon at the end is important. Make sure to have no extra blanks in the command. I assume the directory a1644923 is in your current directory. You can copy/paste that command into your shell.\nIf you need to transfer a complete directory instead you must enable recursive mode. I am assuming you have a directory project1 in your current directory. So type\nscp -r project1/ a1644923@uss.cs.adelaide.edu.au:\n\nMind the blank between scp and -r. The command is scp and -r is a parameter, telling scp to work recursively, i.e. to copy everything below.\n\nA: Hello Mike do it like this:\nsudo apt-get install sshfs\n\nsshfs username@server:/home/UsersHomeFolderAtServer mnt/\n\nin your local home directory create the folder mnt then mount your home folder from the server to your local machine. You can then work with your files locally but there are uploaded to the server when you make changes.\ni would recommend to compile the files on the server because it may have diffrent library/package version installed than you have on your local machine.\n\nA: The error is telling you that it cannot find the file at the location you specified (stat is a function to test a file for existence, among other things).\nAssuming that the file is in a directory /a1644923/testscp on the remote machine, your problem seems to be the spaces after the colons; they should not be there.  Generally, if you have a space in a filename, you need to escape it with '\\ ', or use quotes.  Otherwise, it's interpreted as separate parameters.\nscp is really not any more complicated than cp, except it copies from one machine to another.  But it has a very similar syntax, just the file specification format needs an extra specifier for the machine, if it's different than yours (you don't need to specify your own machine).\nEdit:  \nFrom what you stated about the libraries being on the remote computer and all, it seems like you want to compile the sourcefiles on the remote computer to use those libraries.  It sounds to me like everything is expected to be done on the remote computer, so your local computer is basically just a remote terminal.\nWhen I was in a similar situation, I used the same tools remotely as locally (gvim for editing, and other standard Linux tools.  So working remotely was the same as working locally, more or less, and there was no problem remembering to copy files that were changed, or accidentally overwriting new files with old ones.\n", "Q: xbindkeys: Conflicting program So my issue is I just reinstalled Ubuntu 13.04 and as always I install xbindkeys and set up my search button to be middle click and the scroll wheel side clicks to copy/paste. However it was working but after a reboot it didn't start. Tried to manually start but nothing, and xbindkeys -n shows: \n*** Warning *** Please verify that there is not another program running\nwhich captures one of the keys captured by xbindkeys. It seems that there\nis a conflict, and xbindkeys can't grab all the keys defined in its\nconfiguration file.\n\nHow can I find out what is conflicting with xbindkeys? I disabled the Search key shortcut in the Settings > Keyboard which worked last time but this time its not helping.\n\nA: The only solution I see is to kill processes one by one and try to run xbindkeys -n each time. Then you will be able to deduce which process occupies your key combinations. To identify which PIDs you should kill look at ps aufx|grep $(whoami). Start with obvious ones, then continue with leaves except of course non-X applications (bash, mc, etc.) and your terminal application. Unless you kill your terminal app you should be able to proceed.\n\nA: Cite from Community Help Wiki - Keyboard Shortcuts\n\nLaptop Function Shortcuts\nMany laptops have function Fn keys which you can hold down\n  to access more functions on the laptop's keyboard. A list of these\n  functions should be available from the manufacturer of the laptop.\nText Entry Shortcuts\nIf you want to have quick access to lines of text by using a hotkey,\n  for example to enter your email address in forms, then you can use\n  xbindkeys. Xbindkeys has a GUI utility to allow easy settings of\n  hotkeys, but be aware that it's a little more complicated than the\n  default Ubuntu Shortcutkeys interface.\n  \n  \n*\n  \n*Install xbindkeys:\nsudo apt-get install xbindkeys\n\n  \n*Create the default config file for xbindkeys:\nxbindkeys --defaults > /home/your-user-name/.xbindkeysrc\n\n  \n*When thats done, install xbindkeys-config, the GUI for xbindkeys:\nsudo apt-get install xbindkeys-config\n\n  \n*Now the utility that actually does the \"typing\":\nsudo apt-get install xvkbd\n\n  \n*Once each is installed, start both applications by bringing up Run\n  Application Alt+F2:\nxbindkeys\n\n  \n*and Alt+F2:\nxbindkeys-config\n\nTo keep the xbindkeys hotkeys active when you next start the\n  computer you will have to add a new session, System > Preferences >\n  Sessions. Put in the command xbindkeys into the command field.\nYou should be able to see the Xbindkeys Config window. Start a new\n  hotkey. Hit New on the bottom row of buttons. Then use the edit\n  area at the top right. Give the hotkey a name. Hit the GetKey\n  button to set the keypress for a hotkey. Some hotkeys may conflict\n  with other hotkeys on the system (a window will open or a compiz\n  plugin will activate). If this happens then choose another combination\n  like Ctrl+Alt+F for example.\nNow put the command to activate with that hotkey in the Action\n  field. This can be anything, but to allow for the entry of a line of\n  text into part of the GUI enter\nxvkbd -xsendevent -text \"myemail@server.com\"\n\nThe example shows an email address but it can be any line of text. Now\n  hit Apply and test the hotkey in a Firefox field, text editor, or\n  anywhere that text can be entered. Please note that using Run\n  Action will not be able to test the command in xbindkeys-config,\n  you will have to test it somewhere else.\nReplacing keys with other keys\nIf you want to use xbindkeys to override certain keys on your\n  keyboard, you can catch them with xbindkeys, and then emit new\n  keypresses using xmacro. To install xmacro, use:\nsudo apt-get install xmacro\n\nAfter this, you can find out the commands for specific keypresses by\n  starting xmacrorec:\nxmacrorec :0.0\n\nFirst give it the key which will allow you to quit the app, then press\n  the keys you want to know the codes for. After this, you can use those\n  codes in the commands you tell xbindkeys to run, for example:\nxmacroplay-keys :0.0 KeyStr Next\n\nwill simulate a key press of the PageDown key. Thus, in my .xbindkeysrc the following contents\n\"xmacroplay-keys :0.0 KeyStr Prior\"\n  XF86Back\n\n\"xmacroplay-keys :0.0 KeyStr Next\"\n  XF86Forward\n\nwill turn the Backward/Forward buttons on my Thinkpad T41 into PageDown and PageUp keys, and\n  will no longer disturb my browsing as I accidentally press those\n  Backward/Forward while browsing.\n\n", "Q: Aptana Studio 3 doesn't have a launcher icon When running Aptana Studio 3, the icon in the Unity launcher is a grey square with a question mark.

During setup, I had selected the encrypted home directory option but unfortunately skipped the step asking me to record a passphrase.\nI managed to set a new password for my account by booting into single-user mode, but as described in \"can't login after password change (ecryptfs)\", I am thrown back to the login manager when trying to use my new password. The answer to aforesaid question linked me to Annoyance changing password with Ecryptfs, which suggests running ecryptfs-mount-private, but unfortunately that merely returns ERROR: Encrypted private directory is not set up properly.\nDoes Ecryptfs set a default passphrase in such instances, or if not, is there any other way to recover my data? (Said data largely consists of a few saved image files and Oolite savestates, so I wouldn't mind a total loss that much … but it's the principle that matters here.) If not, would the easiest way to get a usable system again be a partition wipe and reinstall? (In this case I would probably want to delete the single partition set by Ubuntu setup and define multiple partitions myself ― advice on what amount of swap space is recommended on a 64Bit system with 8GB RAM would be welcome.)\n\nA: Not sure about recovery options, but as far as getting a usable system, you should be able to reformat the /home partition (since it should be a separate partition, due to the encryption). I haven't really dealt with separate /home partitions much, so not sure what else you'll need to get a usable system. If you have root, you should be ok. If you haven't set a root password (which is generally not recommended, but can be handy if you know what you're doing), I'm not entirely sure how you'd go about getting your user account setup on the fresh /home partition. You may need to research reformatting /home partitions.\nThe other option is to just reinstall, as you mentioned, and honestly from the sound of it, it won't be that much more painful for you to do it that way, considering you didn't seem to have much going on with your current install.\nOh, by the way, you may want to create a data storage partition. There are two good reasons for this. One, you can have a shared partition that both Windows and Ubuntu can access for media files. Two, if you ever need to wipe one of the OS's out, or get locked out like you have here, the files will still be accessible. Of course, if you want it to be shared, you'll need to make it an NTFS partition, and then setup a UserMap, so that Ubuntu and Windows know which permissions to\nAs for swap, with that much RAM, you really don't need that much, probably anywhere from 4 to 8 GB should be more than large enough (and I think you can skimp by with as little as 256MB).

One possible solution that I know to deal with this problem is re-downloading the entire ISO file again which is very difficult for users with low bandwidth. Are there any alternative solutions which does not require the user to re-download the entire ISO file?\n\nA: After you have downloaded the whole file, there's not so much you can do to fix it than a full re-download; except if you should find someone offering the file in (unencrypted, non-archived) parts, along with separate hash sums. Because otherwise you wouldn't even know in which part of the file the problem is, and therefore which part you still need again. I do not know of a program which does that for finished downloads.\nSo your best bet probably is to switch to a transmission tool like bittorrent, which does the splitting up into chunks internally, and which also checks hash sums for each of the chunks separately. For each part it will check if it was transferred correctly, and will re-download only that part if it was not.\nIn the end you will have the complete, correct file, without any manual intervention required.\n\nA: You can use a download manager, such as FlareGet.

See image below (Taken during installation, and choosing something else at install type screen).\n\n\nA: Default file system is ext3. \nFor more information regarding ext3 and ext4 refer here\n\nA: Ext3\nExt3 stands for third extended file system.\nIt was introduced in 2001. Developed by Stephen Tweedie.\nStarting from Linux Kernel 2.4.15 ext3 was available.\nThe main benefit of ext3 is that it allows journaling.\nJournaling has a dedicated area in the file system, where all the changes are tracked. When the system crashes, the possibility of file system corruption is less because of journaling.\nMaximum individual file size can be from 16 GB to 2 TB\nOverall ext3 file system size can be from 2 TB to 32 TB\nThere are three types of journaling available in ext3 file system.\n    Journal – Metadata and content are saved in the journal.\n    Ordered – Only metadata is saved in the journal. Metadata are journaled only after writing the content to disk. This is the default.\n    Writeback – Only metadata is saved in the journal. Metadata might be journaled either before or after the content is written to the disk.\nYou can convert a ext2 file system to ext3 file system directly (without backup/restore).\n\nExt4\nExt4 stands for fourth extended file system.\nIt was introduced in 2008.\nStarting from Linux Kernel 2.6.19 ext4 was available.\nSupports huge individual file size and overall file system size.\nMaximum individual file size can be from 16 GB to 16 TB\nOverall maximum ext4 file system size is 1 EB (exabyte). 1 EB = 1024 PB (petabyte). 1 PB = 1024 TB (terabyte).\nDirectory can contain a maximum of 64,000 subdirectories (as opposed to 32,000 in ext3)\nYou can also mount an existing ext3 fs as ext4 fs (without having to upgrade it).\nSeveral other new features are introduced in ext4: multiblock allocation, delayed allocation, journal checksum. fast fsck, etc. All you need to know is that these new features have improved the performance and reliability of the filesystem when compared to ext3.\nIn ext4, you also have the option of turning the journaling feature “off”.\n\n", "Q: How can I find out my user name?

In other words, when I was working on ubuntu live usb I download files pdf, zip, etc, am asking how can I retrieve these files to access them on my windows machine.\nThanks A lot\n\nA: The only way is to create a Live CD on your USB drive, and giving it persistence.  Depending on how man GBs the USB drive is, you will have plenty of space to store items.  If you are in need of transferring them immediately, your best bet is likely to simply plug another USB drive into the system, and copy everything into it.\n\nA: That depends on whether you had created a persistence partition.\nIf you did not create persistence when you created the LiveUSB, and you aren't booted into the LiveUSB the files are likely gone as the Live session doesn't save files after you close out the session unless you create a persistence system.\nIf you did create persistence, you can boot up the LiveUSB and then open the partition that has Windows from within that Live session, and copy your files to the Windows partition so they're available when you boot into windows.\n", "Q: The purpose of updating after adding a ppa repository When adding a ppa repository using sudo add-apt-repository ppa:..., why should I execute sudo apt-get update? \nI am new to Ubuntu and I don't see the purpose of it because there aren't packages installed from the repo.

It is part of the testdisk package. Install it with\nsudo apt-get install testdisk\n\nThen run photorec as super user\nsudo photorec\n\nYou'll be presented with the list of connected devices, including your hard drives. Select the memory card (it will probably be something like /dev/sdb or /dev/sdc but check it carefully). Follow the on screen instructions.\nAnother alternative is recoverjpeg that is specifically tailored for JPEG recovery.\nInstall it with:\nsudo apt-get install recoverjpeg\n\nOpen \"Disks\" (you find it in your applications). You'll find the list of connected devices. Select the memory card. On the right hand you'll find the details of the device included where it is mapped (eg: /deb/sdb1)\nThen you can try with recoverjpeg like so:\nsudo recoverjpeg /dev/sdb1\n\nIMPORTANT: replace sdb1 with your actual device!\nYou'll find the recovered pictures in your home directory.\nAlso have a look at this https://help.ubuntu.com/community/DataRecovery\n", "Q: Can't resume after hibernation I tried to hibernate using pm-hibernate but when I start Ubuntu again I can't get to login screen.but when i tried to login lightdm keeps restarting and keeping me from login .\nplease help me?\nI'm new to ubuntu.\nsudo startx\nFetal server error:\nServer is already active for display 0\nif this server is no longer running, remove /tmp/.X0-lock and start again\nddSignGiveUp: Closing log\nInvalid MIT-MAGIC-COOKIE-1 KeyInvalid MIT-MAGIC-COOKIE-1 Keyxinit: giving up\nxinit: unable to connect to X server: Resource temporarily unavaliable\nxinit: server error \n\n\nA: What laptop do you have?

And how can I change the file location to /var/www/?\n\nA: I believe you want to try something like this. (don't forget the double slash at the end.)\n:w /var/www//%:t\n\n\nA: Inside Vim, no matter where the file is currently saved, you can give the path to the new location where you want to save it. For example, to save the file on your Desktop:\npress esc to go into normal mode, then type\n:w ~/Desktop/filename\n\nThis works for any path where you have permission to write on the directory. If you want to save somewhere where you don't have write permission, you can do this:\n:w !sudo tee /path/to/my/filename\n\n\nA: You can enter :pwd to display the current working directory. This is where your file will be saved if simply enter :w filename.  You can change the working directory with :cd path/to/new/directory. Or you can enter the full path to the location where you want to save the file with the write command, e.g., :w /var/www/filename. \n\nA: If you created a new file with Vim, pressing the key sequence Esc-:-w-q-Enter will save the file to the current location where you launched Vim. For example, if you were at /home/$USER the file will be created under this directory. The easy way is to launch vim using:\nvim myFile.txt\n\nThis will create a new file, or overwrite a file with name myFile.txt in the current location.\n\nA: The w vim command supports as parameter the filename, that can contain a path, so\n:w /var/www/filename\n\nshould work, provided you have permissions to write to that directory.\nYou could also use tab completion to build the pathname.\nThe bare command :w only works if you started vim giving it a filename already.\n\nA: On your launcher the second icon is a picture of a filing cabinet. This is called Nautilus (Ubuntu's File Manager).\nSelect Nautilus and your home directory should open. You should see your file there.\nRight click on your file and select 'copy'. Open your email, compose a new message, click on the message body. Then 'right click' and this time select 'Paste'.\nThese instructions work for Ubuntu 14.04 and 16.04 but I don't know if 12.04 includes Nautilus.\n\nA: Navigate to the directory you want to save the new file to, open the file you wish to edit and then use \nEsc:sav newfilename or Esc:w newfilename That should work for you.\nFor more on tips with vim you might find this cheatsheet useful.\nEdit as requested.\n:sav saves the file with a new name and opens the new file in Vim.\nNote:\n:sav won’t close the initial buffer, it will hide it. By default, hidden buffers are unloaded. \n:w save the file with a new name but keeps the original open for editing.\nEdit source: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/4980168/how-to-save-as-a-new-file-and-keep-working-on-the-original-one-in-vim\n\nA: If the filepath and filename you are trying to save to has no spaces then camsolo's answer (:w /var/www/filename) will work for you. If the filepath/filename has space(s) in it then you will need to escape those space to save it there. I have noticed that all or some versions of vim will not save to a filepath when quotation marks are in the command.\nThis will not work: :w \"/var/www/pa th/file name\"\nThis will work: :w /var/www/pa\\ th/file\\ name\n", "Q: What is a makefile exactly and how we can create one?

For global UNIX/shell tasks, you're looking for shell scripts, not makefiles :)\nSee http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Make_(software)#Makefiles for more information about makefiles, and http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shell_script to discover shell scripts.\nA basic shell script for what you're trying to do could be :\n#!/bin/bash\necho \"Hello world, today is $(date +%a)\"\ngzip -c SOURCE DESTINATION\n\nStore this in a file, and execute it using your shell prompt (bash myscript.sh, sh myscript.sh, ...). You can also make the script executable using :\nchmod +x myscript.sh\n\nAnd then execute it with your default interpretor with :\n./myscript.sh\n\n\nA: Why not create a shell script, then create a symbolic link that points to the shell script you created?  Place the symbolic link in a directory that's in the PATH, so that you can 'run' the symbolic link no matter the directory in which you are located.  \n", "Q: What are the system requirements for each flavour of Ubuntu Desktop? I'm thinking about installing Ubuntu Desktop, but I don't know what flavor is the best for my system. What are the minimum and recommended hardware requirements? What kind of CPU? How much memory? Should I have Hardware Acceleration? What flavor should I use?\n\nThis is an attempt of a canonical answer. My answers have the \"official  requirements\", the recommended are a mix of official sources and opinion based (along with the answer it's told the source). You can comment or edit if you feel that the information is obsolete or incomplete.\nIt is a good rule of thumb that any system capable of running Windows\nVista, 7, 8, x86 (Intel) OS X will almost always be a lot faster with any\nUbuntu flavor even if they are lower-spec than described below.\n\n\nA: Ubuntu Mate\nUbuntu Mate is a  official flavour of Ubuntu, based on Mate DE.

The minimum requirements for newer release is unofficial and subject to testing on real hardware or in a virtual machine (VM). Kubuntu has varying requirements on VM.\nXenial Xerus (16.04) on VM: Requires at least 1 GB RAM, 10 GB fixed-size Virtual Disk Image, 128 MB video memory. Selecting \"Try Kubuntu\" or \"Install Kubuntu\" does not matter. Live session will takes time to load; If virtual machine has stopped responding, do reset and start again. Installation may take longer time. User will see \"low disk space warning\" during installation but will succeed.\nBionic Beaver (18.04) on VM: Requires VT-x/AMD-V hardware acceleration, regardless of 32-bit or 64-bit ISO image. Requires at least 9 GB fixed-size Virtual Disk Image. With 512 MB RAM, choose either \"Try Kubuntu\" or \"Install Kubuntu\"; otherwise, running the installer from desktop will not work as expected. With 768 MB RAM, user can first choose \"Try Kubuntu\" and later can also run the installer from the live desktop.\nRecommended\n\n\n*\n\n*1 GHz dual core processor or better\n\n*2 GB of system memory (RAM)\n\n*10 GB of free disk space (the more hard disk capacity, the better)\n\n*VGA capable of 1024x768 screen resolution. If desktop effects are desired, a supported GPU is required.\n\n\nThe recommended requirement is based on this poorly cited source on Wikipedia and this partially compatible requirements for Ubuntu 16.04. The amount of system memory and free disk space are similar to the requirements for KDE neon.\nKubuntu has no official system requirements to this revised date.\n\nA: Modern Lubuntu (using LXQt)\n\nThe Lubuntu team published Taking a New Direction\nwhich states\n\nour main focus is shifting from providing a distribution for old\nhardware to a functional yet modular distribution focused on getting\nout of the way and letting users use their computer.\n\nwith the following goals\n\n\n*\n\n*Lubuntu will leverage modern, Qt-based technologies and programs to give users a functional yet modular experience.\n\n*In collaboration with others, Lubuntu will continue to be a transparent and open distribution which makes it a priority to keep\nthe community informed about the development when possible.\n\n*Lubuntu will create and maintain complete documentation which will be included by default in the operating system, and can guide anyone\nfrom beginner to expert on how to use Lubuntu to its full potential\nand contribute to the further development of it.\n\n*Lubuntu will keep a light experience by default but enable users to utilize more heavy and featureful components as desired.\n\n*Lubuntu will have the ability to be used in any language across the world, and enable contributors to easily translate all components of\nthe operating system.\n\n\nmeaning\n\nThis means that Lubuntu will stay light, and for users with old\nsystems, should still be usable. But we will no longer provide minimum\nsystem requirements and we will no longer primarily focus on older\nhardware.\n\nDevices with as little as 1GB of RAM were used in QA-testing Lubuntu up to and into the disco cycle (or Lubuntu 19.04), however devices used for QA-testing later releases contained 2GB or more of RAM.\nYour requirements will vary on how you use your machine, especially application choice (ie. selecting software that uses the same libraries already used by your desktop means less RAM is required).\nLubuntu up to 18.04 used the LXDE desktop which used the GTK2 toolkit. The LXDE developers however felt GTK3 was too heavy, so had joined forces with the Razor-Qt developers creating a new LXQt desktop that would remain light and fully utilize Qt5.\nLubuntu doesn't use KF5 (KDE Frameworks 5) so whilst KDE apps will efficiently use Qt5 libs already used by the desktop, the hit to many KDE apps is the need to load KF5, which is still likely less than using an GTK3 app.\nThe right choice for you, will depend very much on what applications you use.\nA recent Front Page Linux article wrote\n\n\"When we start to look at RAM utilization and hard disk space, the\nclear stand-out is Lubuntu\"\n\nhowever as already indicated, if you need specific GTK3 apps, Lubuntu may not be best for your use-case; only you can decide what's best for you; based on what you'll use your machine for.\n\nA: Regarding 32-bit x86 CPUs\nAs of October 2019 (Ubuntu version 19.10 and 20.04 LTS), the 32-bit x86 architecture is no longer officially supported in Ubuntu.\nThis means that if you still have a 32-bit CPU, the best option is to look for another Linux distribution that officially supports 32-bit x86 architecture.\nTo find out details about your CPU, visit the following links and search for your CPU model:\n\n*\n\n*Intel CPUs\n\n*AMD CPUs\n", "Q: Setting up websites with Ubuntu 13.04 server and Nginx I'm trying to setup 2 websites on my server ---> A_website and B_website\nI don't have a domain name registered and I just want to use the site privately so I'll be accessing it via the static IP address that my ISP gave me.\nI have installed a fresh Ubuntu 13.04 server and I have installed fresh Nginx + PHP + MySQL by referencing from the following website.\nHow do I go about setting/configuring my Nginx so that I can access my websites by typing the following in the browser URL box: my.isp.address/A_website/index.html and my.isp.address/B_website/index.html?\nCurrently it's still pointing to the default Nginx site folder /usr/share/nginx/html/.\n\nA: Create a folder called A_website and a folder called B_website inside /usr/share/nginx/html/. Put the files for each \"site\" in their own folder.\nIf you actually want them to be separate sites rather than directories on the same site, you would have to set up two separate instances of your server operating on different ports with different working directories. Then instead of the subdirectory thing you described you would use the IP with the port specified at the end. I don't know how to do that with Nginx, but I think Cherokee can do it easily through its administration interface. EDIT: not that you should switch servers just for this hack. You probably don't even need this.\n", "Q: How to create command line application in eclipse (c++ or java)? How to create command line application c++ or Java?\nI have some commands which I would like to convert into an application.\nHow to do it in eclipse?\nJust for example consider:\nsudo apt-get upgrade xyz\n\nI want to get it into ubuntu repository. \nOr I'll create a gui using qt with c++ or java plugin. \n\nA: In C++ you can use int system (const char* command); function.\nExample:\n/* system example : DIR */\n#include <stdio.h>      /* printf */\n#include <stdlib.h>     /* system, NULL, EXIT_FAILURE */\n\nint main ()\n{\n  int i;\n  printf (\"Checking if processor is available...\");\n  if (system(NULL)) puts (\"Ok\");\n    else exit (EXIT_FAILURE);\n  printf (\"Executing command DIR...\\n\");\n  i=system (\"dir\");\n  printf (\"The value returned was: %d.\\n\",i);\n  return 0;\n}\n\nSource: http://www.cplusplus.com/reference/cstdlib/system/\nIn your case you can use:\nsystem (\"sudo apt-get upgrade\");\n\nIn Java is slightly more complicated. You can use exec method of the Runtime class in java.lang. See http://www.linuxforums.org/forum/programming-scripting/65117-c-c-system-function-analog-java.html\n\nA: If you want to be able to use the apt-get command with your programm, it needs to be in a apt repository, whose url must be in the /etc/apt/sources.list file. You can learn how to set up your own apt repository here.\n", "Q: Why is $PATH used as a variable? Couldn't there be a config text file instead?\n\nA: The PATH variable is used in lots of operations, reading it from a file would have a huge cost. And because every process has its own environmental variables it would mean one file for every process. It is easy to see why it is not stored on the drive.\n\nA: PATH is an environmental variable in Linux and other Unix-like operating systems that tells the shell which directories to search for executable files. Environmental variables are a class of variables that tell the shell how to behave as the user works at the command line or with shell scripts.\nIn this way, PATH variable can be changed relatively easily and you can make a lot of operations easily with it. But, if you use instead a config text file for PATH, I think that all these easily things will become a headache.\nAnyway, you can set PATH as you wish in a config/initialization file like ~/.profile.\n\nA: I for instance have my own directory of scripts, under my home $HOME/.scripts where I can put some executables. Since I also added this directory to the $PATH variable, I can call any of my scripts just by the filename, without using the whole route the  scripts are stored.\n", "Q: About Intel 82865g Well I think this is already been asked but any of those questions did not answer me.\nMy computer, a HP d260 MT brand machine has the following specs:\n\n\n*\n\n*Pentium 4 processor @3.0 Ghz\n\n*On-board Intel 82865G graphics controller @ 96mb\n\n*1 GB RAM\n\n\nI have seen many telling that with their Intel 82865G graphics they are able to run ubuntu 13.04 but I tried ubuntu 11.04 on my computer last year and its desktop screen was not showing and unity was not working \nPlease help me.\n\nA: Ubuntu should install on your computer and it will also run, but the performance won't be good. Why do you want to install Ubuntu 13.04? In order to continue to get software updates, you'll have to reinstall or upgrade the operating system at the end of the nine-month term of support. A Long Term Support release such as Ubuntu 12.04 which has a five-year term of support, or Xubuntu 12.04 which has a three-year term of support would be better. For better performance select Xubuntu 12.04.\n\nA: You may want to add some RAM.

Using it is simple:\nscrot filename.png -s\nwith the -s option allowing to grab a selection of the screen.\nUnfortunately, I don't know how you can redirect output to the clipboard.\nAnother option is the use of xwd. However, this one does not allow interactive selection of the region to take a picture of.\nEDIT: I always forget about this easier way. If you have Gimp installed, it is very easy to grab a screenshot by using File>Create>Screenshot. It is very fast and you can edit your screenshot right away or copy to clipboard.\n\nA: Press SHIFT+PRINT, select what you want to capture and click on copy to clipboard\n", "Q: What's the downside of choosing  in resolvconf's configuration dialog? An automatic restart by its Windows host has somehow messed up my Ubuntu (12.04 lts) VirtualBox's resolvconf.  (For one thing, /etc/resolv.conf is gone.)\nTherefore, I ran\n% sudo dpkg-reconfigure resolvconf\n\n...upon which I am presented with the following dialog:\nThe resolvconf package contains the infrastructure required for dynamic updating of\nthe resolver configuration file. Part of the necessary infrastructure is a symbolic\nlink from /etc/resolv.conf to /run/resolvconf/resolv.conf. If you choose this\noption then this link will be created; the existing /etc/resolv.conf file will be\npreserved as /etc/resolvconf/resolv.conf.d/original, and will be restored if this\npackage is removed.\n\nDeclining this option will prevent future installations from recreating the\nsymbolic link and therefore the resolver configuration file will not be dynamically\nupdated. Dynamic updating can then be activated following instructions in the\nREADME file.\n\nThe presence of resolvconf can affect the behavior of other programs, so it should\nnot be left installed if unconfigured.\n\nPrepare /etc/resolv.conf for dynamic updates?\n\n                         <Yes>                       [<No>]\n\n(Note that the  option is the one selected by default.)\nMy question is:\n\nCan someone explain to me what are the downsides to choosing <Yes>?\n\n(I understand the downsides to choosing <No>, but I don't see the downsides to choosing <Yes>, though I have to assume there are such downsides, otherwise it's hard to understand why I'd be given the choice in the first place.)\n\nA: If you want to use resolvconf (which an Ubuntu user normally does) then you normally choose Yes here. Choose No only if you want to install resolvconf but not activate its control of the glibc resolver. Some people do this for special reasons that I need not go into here.\nThe question was originally added in order to try to remain in compliance with Debian policy which is very fussy about what packages may do to configuration files.\nThe default answer should be Yes. If the default answer is No in your case and you don't know why, then ask a question about that or file bug report against resolvconf. \n", "Q: OS selection option in grub goes in a flash I am using Ubuntu 12.04 and windows 7 in dual boot.recently a problem started to occur,sometimes when I switch on my laptop the grub screen to select the OS comes and goes in a flash wwithout giving me any time to switch OS.Apart from that whenever this happens the splash screen of ubuntu flickers with alternate flash screen and some text screen and keeps flickering without booting in.How can I fix this?\n\nA: You can try the application Grub Bootloader (available in the Ubuntu Software Centre.  This will allow you to set  how long the computer waits before booting into the selected OS, as well as choosing which OS is highlighted by default at startup\n\nA: You can adjust grub's timeout by editing /etc/default/grub.

When I was trying to install Ubuntu 12.04 on my laptop, I chose one of major partitions (60G) which contains lots of important files as a swap space. After completing the system installation, I found I had no access to all my files in that partition. That really makes me frustrated. Can someone tell how to copy or recover my files from that partition. Thank you very much!\n\nA: Testdisk is a useful tool to try to recover data. It is commandline and a bit tricky to figure out how to use, but can do recovery on repartitioned hard disk space very well. It has saved my butt numerous times. \n", "Q: How to install WhatsApp? How can I install WhatsApp in Ubuntu?\nRelated:\n\n*\n\n*How to use Whatsapp mobile application on Ubuntu Touch?\n\nA: Since January 2015, users can use WhatsApp on the PC (Including Linux) from within their Chrome, Firefox, Opera or Safari Browser. So basically it is not WhatsApp for PC but WhatsApp for Web. There are limitations to using WhatsApp via Web, some of which are:\n\n\n*\n\n*File Size Limits (Can not Upload 16+ MB Files)\n\n*File Format (Not all file formats are supported. This affects different type of video, images, sound and even document type files)\n\n\nFor the steps simply:\n\n\n*\n\n*Install WhatsApp on your Smartphone.\n\n*Open the website https://web.whatsapp.com/\n\n*On your Phone, open WhatsApp and open the main WhatsApp Menu. You will see a new option called \"WhatsApp Web\", select this option.\n\n*Use the \"WhatsApp Web\" option to scan the QR code in the website mentioned on Step 2\n\n*The webpage will update itself and show you a WebApp of your WhatsApp which includes your contacts, chats and more.\n\n\nThis is nowhere near what Telegram can do and offer in terms of full Linux Support, compatibility with the Desktop, with the desktop environment, downloading / uploading files and more. This also applies for old phones (With SMS only) and more.\n\nA: Steps for Whatsapp in Ubuntu 14.04:\nStep1: Download Genymotion\nStep2: Download VirtualBox\nStep3: sudo dpkg -i virtualbox-4.3_4.3.12-93733~Ubuntu~raring_amd64.deb; sudo apt-get install -f\nStep4: tar -xf genymotion-2.2.0_x64.bin; cd genytmotion; ./genymotion\nStep5: Download image, run it and download WhatpsApp in the emulator\nStep6: Register with your mobile number, you'll receive a code. Enter it after 5 minutes.\nWorking proof till step 5: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MHmMDEzsJEY\n\nA: This might be the Simplest Method to follow to install Whatsapp Client on Ubuntu or any other Linux Platform.\nMin.

Since it is common for phone numbers to be recycled by mobile providers, it is possible that the previous owner of your current phone number used WhatsApp.\n\nWhat this means, that Whatsapp is tied to phones to work. If you don't use phones you don't get Whatsapp.\nThere are efforts to make Whatsapp work using a system account, of course you must already have an account with your phone, so, no, you can't have a independent account for your PC (unless you connect a SIM-Card to your computer).\nWhatsapp has been creating clients for Windows, apart of their Web Whatsapp that requires a browser. Both limited in functionality and focused only on chats.\nWhatsApp FAQ - Why is my phone number already in WhatsApp?\n\nA: There is no native app of whatsapp on Ubuntu neither on any other desktop OS.\nInstead you can use whatsapp on desktops using two approaches:\n\n\n*\n\n*use the  web app \n\n*install whatsapp on android emulator in Ubuntu\nFollow the links above for each method.\n\nA: One can now install the Whatsapp Windows desktop app (not just a Webapp) on Linux using Wine.

You can found it here:\nhttps://launchpad.net/grub-customizer\n\nA: You have two grub2s as boot loaders. Whichever is in MBR is the one used to boot. Which are you using Ubuntu's or Backtracks? The first in the menu is the one in the MBR that you use to boot.\nIf Booting with Backtrack, you may just need to run this:\nsudo update-grub\n\nIf you want Ubuntu's grub to be in charge or installed to MBR you can boot into Ubuntu and just install its grub to the MBR. If drive is sda:\nsudo grub-install /dev/sda\n\nBut then any updates in Backtrack would need the update-grub to refresh the menu in Ubuntu.\n", "Q: Creating filesystem from nothing I need to create filesystem with just one partition from nothing (/dev/zero). \nI tried this sequence of commands:\ndd if=/dev/zero of=mountedImage.img bs=512 count=131072\nfdisk mountedImage.img\n    n\n    p \n    2048\n    131072\n\nBasically, I need to create 64MB image file filled with zeroes. Then I use fdisk to create new partition for new filesystem, starting at sector 2048 and using all remaining sectors. But now I'm hitting problems. If I set up a loop device and format it using mkfs -t vfat, partition table is overwritten and filesystem is placed to disk. I don't need whole disk formatted with FAT32, I just need my primary partition to be so. \nDoes anybody know how can I format only one partition of raw disk image, not whole image? Please help.\n\nA: One solution which doesn't require root privileges is to create a file with the size of the partition, call mkfs on that file, then copy the file into place.\ntruncate -s 64512k part1.vfat\n/sbin/mkfs.vfat part1.vfat\ndd if=part1.vfat of=mountedImage.img bs=1k skip=2048\n\nAlternatively, with root privileges, you can set up a loop device that gives you access to the image as a device. Since you want to access only part of the image, you'll have to indicate that explicitly.\nsudo losetup -o 2048k --sizelimit 64512k đev/loop0 mountedImage.img\nsudo mkfs.vfat /dev/loop0\nsudo losetup -d /dev/loop0\n\nTo work with more comfortable tools, you need root privileges and a reboot. The loop module can provide access to partitions, but this is disabled by default. To enable this access, edit /etc/default/grub and change the line GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX=\"\" to\nGRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX=\"loop.max_part=15\"\n\nIf there were other options there already, leave them, of course; they need to be separated by spaces and the whole option string must be inside double quotes, e.g. GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX=\"option=value anotheroption loop.max_part=15\".\nNow, after you've partitioned the disk image, run\nsudo losetup /dev/loop0 mountedImage.img\nsudo mkfs.vfat /dev/loop0p1\n\nRun losetup -d /dev/loop0 when you've finished working with that image.\n\nA: Filesystem image files aren't normally partitioned unless they're whole-disk backups or if they're used with virtual machines (QEMU, etc.). For your purposes, you probably want to just create the filesystem directly on the image file. You can then mount it:\nsudo mkdosfs mountedImage.img\nsudo mount -o loop mountedImage.img /mnt\n\nIf you want to subsequently write this image to a USB flash drive or the like, you can write it to a partition:\nsudo dd if=mountedImage.img of=/dev/sdc1\n\n\nA: kpartx\nsudo apt-get install kpartx\nlosetup -fs my.raw\nsudo kpartx -a my.img\nls /dev/mapper\n\nOutput:\n/dev/mapper/loop0\n/dev/mapper/loop0p1\n\nwhere loop0p1 is the first partition, so we can do:\nmkdir -p d\nsudo mount /dev/mapper/loop0p1 d\n\nAdvantage of this method: works on Ubuntu 14.04 without rebooting.\nlosetup 2.21 -P option\nlosetup -P -f --show my.img\n\nCreates one /dev/loopXpY per partition.\nAdvantage: executable pre-installed in many distros (util-linux package).\nDisadvantage: quite recent option, not present in Ubuntu 14.04.\n", "Q: Which version of Ubuntu is the most stable in a dual boot with Windows 8? I am running a laptop with Windows 8 and Ubuntu.  I had been running with the dual boot with Ubuntu 12.04, but had a disc failure (unreleated to linux) and have had to start over.  I had some problems with a shared NTFS data drive, wherein files I wrote to the drive in Ubuntu would not appear in Windows 8.  I was wondering what is currently viewed as the best version of Ubuntu to run alongside Windows 8.\nThanks.\n\nA: \nI was wondering what is currently viewed as the best version of Ubuntu to run alongside Windows 8.\n\nThere is no relation between \"best version of Ubuntu\"  and \"Windows 8\" to run alongside eachother. The 2 are separate entities and GRUB is the software that deals with booting any 2nd or more operating systems present on your system. \nRegarding Ubuntu to use...\n\n\n*\n\n*The latest long term support for Ubuntu is 12.04\n\n*The latest normal release is 13.04.\n\n\nEither works and both are stable. So does and is any other official derivative and so does and is any older still supported release.\nI do not see any problems with any of the releases for Ubuntu to cause trouble with a dual boot setup. The only issues you will face are related to UEFI and Windows. Ubuntu is not an OS that restricts you using the operating system :)\n\nA: I have Windows 8 that comes with my laptop and Ubuntu 13.04 and everything works good, by everything I mean:\n-Google Chrome \n-Mozilla Firefox \n-Thunderbird \n-Skype \n-Netbeans \n-VMware Player \n-VLC Player \n-Audacious Player \n-Ubuntu One \n-Official Intel Graphics Driver \nBut if you want something more stable you can use Ubuntu 12.04 LTS (Long Term Support).\n\nAdvantages of Ubuntu 13.04:\n\n 1) Has better unity performance and use less resources. \n 2) Start button's design is better. \n 3) Unity crashes less often. \n\nAdvantages of Ubuntu 12.04:\n\n 1) It's LTS and will be supported until April/2017. \n 2) It's less probably to have some issues with no response or some fix. \n", "Q: Why is my Nginx package not upgraded? I'm trying to upgrade my nginx install to 1.3+. I already added the PPA for nginx/development and updated with apt-get update.\nI ran this command to install nginx:    \nme@server:~$ sudo apt-get install nginx\n... snip ...\nUnpacking nginx (from .../nginx_1.5.0-1~ppa1~raring_all.deb) ...\nSetting up nginx (1.5.0-1~ppa1~raring) ...\n\nHowever:\nme@server:~$ nginx -v\nnginx version: nginx/1.2.6 (Ubuntu)\n\nIt looks like it installed nginx 1.5, but installed it someplace wacky. I have no idea how to find it if it did. What am I doing wrong?\n\nA: First, you should check whether the 1.5.0 package has actually been successfully installed. Maybe you missed an error message. You can see the currently installed version of a package, among other things, in the output of apt-cache policy packagename, in your case apt-cache policy nginx.\nIf the new package has been installed correctly, maybe you need to restart nginx to have it \"realize\" it has been upgraded.\nTo find out where the files from a package went in your file system, you can use the -L switch of dpkg. In your case, something like dpkg -L nginx should give you a list. Maybe the binary of the newer version went to another directory in your path than the older version's one, so the older one has precendence. You can check where the binary of an command is with whereis. So whereis nginx should tell you where the nginx binary you are using is located. Maybe there are remnants of the 1.2.6 version.\nMy knowledge of nginx is limited, but I would check the following possibilities additionally:\n\n\n*\n\n*Maybe the name of the binary changed from 1.2.6 to 1.5.0 and it isn't nginx -v anymore, but nginx15 -v or something similar?\n\n*Maybe the 1.5.0 version identifies itself as 1.2.6 for some reason? I vaguely remember something similar around Ruby from not too long ago, where 1.9.3 packages were names as \"1.9.1\" for reasons of compatibility to other stuff.\n\n*Maybe the PPA's packages are not meant to upgrade an existing nginx, but to run parallel with it? I can imagine installing a so far unstable development version alongside an older stable version. \n\n*Maybe the packager just did something wrong and shipped an 1.2.6 version by mistake.\n\n\nMuch of the above is speculation, but it should give you some pointers where to look.\n", "Q: Unable to install CBLAS on Ubuntu I am trying to install CBLAS on Ubuntu, and am, as far as I can see, following the instructions in the README file that came in the folder.

For complete instructions you may see here\n\n\n*\n\n*You need to first install BLAS either by sudo apt-get install libblas-dev or by compiling the original implementation:\n1.1. download latest version of the BLAS from http://www.netlib.org/blas/\n1.2. unarchive and go to the folder in the terminal and run make\n1.3. look for the file named blas_LINUX.a and save the address to this file\n\n*compile the netlib cblas:\n2.1. download CBLAS from the same page\n2.2. unarchive\n2.3. open the file Makefile.in\n2.4. look for the line BLLIB = .../blas_LINUX.a\n2.5. put the address you had in step one here\n2.6. go to the terminal in unzipped cblas folder and run make\n\n*look for the cblas.h file in the include folder and when you want to compile link gcc against this folder\nInstructions from here. If looking CBLAS examples you may check here.\n\nA: I tried following Foad's instructions, and thought I was close to being successful, but ultimately couldn't get the program to recognize that I had installed CBLAS.\nI eventually came across the comment to this question, which led me to the solution that immediately worked for me, to just install it from a pre-existing package.\nsudo apt install libopenblas-dev\n\nI hope you still find this answer useful 8 years after you asked the question.\n\nA: Change your variable BLLIB to the location of your dynamic lapack library.\nIn case you are not aware of it, you can find out by using the following commands:\nlocate liblapack\n\nIf you have installed it properly, you should find it in\n/usr/lib/liblapack.a\n/usr/lib/liblapack.so\n\nSo make the following changes,\nBLLIB=/usr/lib/\n\nThen you can execute the following set of commands to compile.\nrm Makefile.in\nln -s Makefile.LINUX Makefile.in\nmake all\n\nRespond if you were able to compile it successfully.\n", "Q: How to apply Xmodmap permanently I had to make some changes to the xmodmap in my home directory.

(The icon for this program looks like an PCI E device (such as a graphics card or sound card)\n\nA: Go to your System Settings in the Unity launcher or at the right top corner of the screen and then go to Additional Drivers section.\nFrom there you will be able to install a driver if it is displayed.\n\n", "Q: Screen - Do command on start I cannot find this anywhere on Google/SE, excuse me if it was just my wording.\nI want to make screen do a command upon start. With pseudo code, doing\n screen -S SomeScreen -c SomeScript.sh\n\nwould make it execute SomeScript.sh automatically, without going into screen and typing this. Thanks!\n(there is no tag for the screen command)\n\nA: You can use the -X switch of screen (uppercase X, lowercase x means something else ;) ) to send a command to an existing screen session.

So, typing screen SomeScript.sh would make it execute SomeScript.sh automatically, without going into screen and typing this. \nIf you're looking for a way to have screen execute some command(s) every time you start a new session, I do it by putting them in ~/.screen-start and putting something like this at the end of .bashrc:\nif [ -n \"$STY\" ]; then\n  source ~/.screen-start\nfi\n\nSince screen sets $STY to the screen session identifier, you can test for whether it's set to know if screen is running.

If the backup software insists on repartitioning the disk when you restore data, it might force use of MBR. At least some EFI computers can boot from MBR disks, though, so this might not be too much of a problem; and even if your computer can't boot from an MBR disk in EFI mode, you should be able to convert it to GPT by using gdisk.\n\n*Boot loader installation -- The restore process might install a BIOS-mode boot loader on the disk, in which case the restored system will probably boot in BIOS mode. If you want to boot in EFI mode, though, you'll need to install an EFI-mode boot loader for Linux. Several are available; see here for detailed information on all of them, including information on how to install them. Note that you'll need an EFI System Partition (ESP), which is a FAT32 partition to hold the EFI boot loader. Chances are your backup software won't create this partition, so you'll have to do so yourself.\n\n\nOne more point: Any restore of one computer's software to another one poses some risk of failure or a need to reconfigure things because of the new hardware (video card, network devices, etc.). Such changes are less likely to be required with a modern Ubuntu than with, say, a distribution from a decade ago, but you should be aware of the possibility that you'll need to tweak something. In some cases, it may be easier to do a fresh installation and then copy over your home directory from the old computer to the new one.\n", "Q: List all internet connections I'd like to know all the connections my system is making to the internet.

It is a Muve Music phone from Cricket.\nI was wondering if I could just put Ubuntu for Phones on it and it would detect my SIM. Would that work? I feel like Ubuntu for Phones might be thrown out there enough for it to work. If not, how can I get my SIM card to work on the Android OS? Do I need to install a whole new operating system? Is there any way that I can use this phone? My current phone doesn't seem to have a strong enough antenna for my area. It's a cheapy knock-off from Hong Kong so anything else would work. Any help is much appreciated\n\nA: I can't find ubuntu phone version for this phone so you may need to port it.

And I've just checked out the Ubuntu website and I have to say, I'm really looking forward to downloading Ubuntu!\nBut I have just one question, which I can't seem to find an answer to. Does the latest version of Ubuntu have Touch support? (This is not a laptop/netbook/notebook, etc - it's a normal all in one desktop computer with full multi-touch support).\n\nA: Ubuntu does have touch support in the uTouch stack. However this touch support does not mean that the entire operating system can be used with touches and gestures.\nTouch support has only recently been added and thus most applications do not provide touch support and can only be used with traditional input devices. I use my touch screen with a script that produces touch events but also simulates mouse events when there is only a single touch on the screen. Without this script I cannot use the touch screen in 99% of the applications available for Ubuntu.\nSo yes there is touch support, but if you want to use standard applications you're pretty much out of luck. Ubuntu cannot be used soley with touch.\n", "Q: How to update from a unsupported version of ubuntu to latest?

Plus some of your installed software that was done under 11.04, might not work with 13.04.  \nI would recommend that you backup any information that you want to keep, and do a fresh install.\nAlso the fact that 11.04 has reached End-of-life.  End-of-life releases are versions of Ubuntu that have no official support. So it would be best to perform a fresh install of the latest Ubuntu release.\nNow if you still want to go the upgrade route, then take a look at Upgrade Notes.\n\nA: Go to search, type update, and an update manager will appear.  When you open then, you will likely be prompted to upgrade to 12.04, and if not, at the top right hand corner of the window, there should be an upgrade to 12.04 now button.\n", "Q: Completely Factory Reset my computer help!

Also it wouldn't load the GUI off the CD when selecting Try Ubuntu before installing.\n\nA: To get everything working in Ubuntu 13.04 , it looks like you need the 3.10 linux kernel for the wireless network, which requires the 13.8 beta catalyst driver from AMD.

That's the only thing that comes into my mind that could cause the kernel's understanding of the partition layout to differ from fdisk's.\nIf so, you need to tell the kernel to re-read the partition table with\nsudo blockdev --rereadpt\n\n(This used to be sfdisk -R, but sfdisk dropped -R in version 2.26.)\nThis can fail (with an error message) if you have any of the partitions of that disk already mounted.  Unmount them and try again.  Sometimes that's not possible (e.g. when your root partition is on the same disk), and you have to reboot instead.\n(There is actually a way to force the kernel to re-read the partition table, which ought to be safe enough if you didn't change the sizes or positions of any of the mounted partition, but I don't remember the exact command line.  I think it involves partx or kpartx.)\n\nA: I tried with the accepted solution but it didn't fix the problem. The problem appeared after i deleted the partition \"A\" and i tried to mount the partition \"B\" in the same folder that was the mount point of \"A\". The OS was trying to reserve it to a death partition, so i edited the etc/fstab file and changed the mount point of \"A\" (there still was the line) with another one, and after rebooting all worked good.

Sometimes, there is a graphical effect that can only be described as flickering or undulation.

It used to happen on windows as well, when I was doing graphically intensive things, but it started appearing on Ubuntu even when I was just browsing the internet.\nI thought it might be a problem with drivers, so I tried to find proper drivers on Ubuntu.

Once downloaded, copy the file as is to the Ubuntu system, and then look at How to install a .tar.gz (or .tar.bz2) file\n\nA: You said in your question that you are \"trying to install package fetch\". \nfetch is a simple, flexible download tool built on the HTTP Fetcher library. There are other utilities out there that handle HTTP downloads (wget) but a lot of them are intended more for mirroring websites and the like;  fetch allows you to download a file at the command line by basically saying 'fetch URL'. fetch can be downloaded www.sourceforge.net fetch webpage.\nBefore installing fetch, the HTTP Fetcher library must be installed.\nIt can be downloaded from: https://sourceforge.net/projects/http-fetcher/?source=directory\nTo install fetch uncompress the fetch package by running tar xf fetch-1.0.tar.gz and from the main fetch directory, type:\nsudo apt-get install build-essential    \n./configure\nmake\nsudo make install\n\nThat's it. The program should then be located in /usr/local/bin/ (unless you specified a different prefix). Note: the above commands are for a basic install, you can also use checkinstall to make a .deb package.\n", "Q: gnome-tweak tool doesn't work I decided to give the GNOME desktop a shot, so, i installed gnome-shell, and later i wanted to tweak things around a bit, to suit my preferences, for which i downloaded the gnome-tweak tool. Now, the gnome-tweak tool is supposed to show up in the menu as Advanced Setting, which it does, however, upon clicking it, i have the icon of Advanced Settings on the top left corner of my window, and along with that, an icon to indicate that it is loading.

I did\n$ sudo chmod 755 -R /usr\n\nIf I knew 10 hours ago what I've learned in researching this, I wouldn't have used that command. I tried this first\n$ chmod 755 -R /usr\n\nThat resulted an a large number of these:\n$ chmod: changing permissions of ‘/usr/dir/file’: Operation not permitted\n\nI tried another sudo command, and that one returns:\neffective uid is not 0, is sudo installed setuid root?\n\nIs there a way to reverse this without a clean reinstall? All I've done for the last 8 or 9 days is to read, configure software, and try to learn how to use the terminal, and I don't exactly look forward to starting that process again, even if not quite back to the beginning.\n\nA: Not really. It's technically feasible, but a clean reinstall will be easier to fix this kind of issue.\nIf you really want to go the hard way, you should boot a live CD and reinstall sudo on your installation. Then reboot and sudo should be working again, allowing you to reinstall all your broken packages, etc.\n", "Q: No Grub direct booting to windows I have lenovo laptop. I installed first windows 7 on a 60 GB partition. Also I had an empty 400 GB partition with ntfs formatting. In the remaining disk space I installed Ubuntu 13.04 Gnome edition and a 2 GB swap-partition. After installing Ubuntu I restarted and instead of showing any GRUB menu it directly boots to windows 7. I tried to boot from the live CD and checked that the Ubuntu is already installed. I tried the chroot command to access the installed Ubuntu from the live cd and tried install-grub and update-grub. They worked fine. The update-grub command showed all the three entries for Win 7 and rest two for Ubuntu. But when I restarted nothing showed up and I booted directly to Windows 7.\nPlease help me to get GRUB menu. I've tried re-installing Ubuntu but it didn't help.\n\nA: First, it's generally a good idea to determine your system's current boot mode, as described here. Knowing the boot mode will enable you to make more informed decisions when it comes to both installation and recovery. In particular, it's entirely possible that your problem derives from mismatched boot modes -- you might have installed Windows in EFI mode and Linux in BIOS mode, which can create the type of problem you've described.\nThat said, a general-purpose solution to your type of problem is to run the Ubuntu Boot Repair tool. There's a good chance that this will work, but if Windows is booting in EFI mode, you should be sure to boot your Linux live CD in EFI mode to run Boot Repair. If Boot Repair fails, post back with the URL that the tool provides. This will give more detailed information about your computer, which is vital for proper diagnosis of the problem.\n", "Q: How to get same Portuguese keyboard as Ubuntu in Xubuntu I have installed Xubuntu 13.04 but am finding that the Portuguese keyboard layout is not the same as the Portuguese layout I had in Ubuntu 12.04 LTS.\nI am using the UK Microsoft Curve 2000.

The best guide to follow is:\nHide your disks or partitions from Nautilus\nI followed the guide just the other day and it worked well.

How can I fix this? Ever since I switched to LXDE my power button won't work anymore. I would love to be able to display a fancy logout menu like the one in Unity and similar DEs. How can I achieve this?\n\nA: The ACPID way\n\nOverview\nThere are numerous ways of fixing this issue. If you look through the web you will find suggestions on installing power managers used in other desktop environments (DEs) like xfce4-power-manager or gnome-settings-daemon. However, as an LXDE user you are probably striving for a lightweight solution. One lightweight way to display a logout menu on power button press is to utilize an ACPID script.\nWhat is ACPID?\nFrom the ArchWiki:\n\nacpid is a flexible and extensible daemon for delivering ACPI events.\n  It listens on /proc/acpi/event and when an event occurs, executes\n  programs to handle the event. These events are triggered by certain\n  actions, such as: \n  \n  \n*\n  \n*Pressing special keys, including the Power/Sleep/Suspend button \n  \n*Closing a notebook lid (Un)Plugging an AC power adapter from a    notebook \n  \n*(Un)Plugging phone jack etc.\n\nInstallation\nsudo apt-get install acpi acpid\n\nConfiguration\nOpen /etc/acpi/powerbtn.sh in a text editor of your choice, e.g. leafpad:\ngksudo leafpad /etc/acpi/powerbtn.sh\n\nAt the end of the file you will find the following passage:\n# If all else failed, just initiate a plain shutdown.\n/sbin/shutdown -h now \"Power button pressed\"\n\nJust before this passage add the following snippet:\n# If LXDE is running execute lxsession-logout\nif [ -n $(pidof lxsession) ]; then\n    for x in /tmp/.X11-unix/*; do\n       displaynum=`echo $x | sed s#/tmp/.X11-unix/X##`\n       getXuser;\n       if [ x\"$XAUTHORITY\" != x\"\" ]; then\n           export DISPLAY=\":$displaynum\"\n           export _LXSESSION_PID=`pidof lxsession`\n           lxsession-logout\n           exit\n       fi\n    done\nfi\n\nMost of the snippet consists of functions and commands that make sure that a graphical application like the logout menu can be run by ACPID (setting environment variables like XUSER and DISPLAY). \nNote: If you have GNOME components running in your LXDE session (e.g. nautilus, various daemons) the session detection might go wrong. In these cases I would advise you to insert the code in the following way:\n  if pidof x $PMS > /dev/null; then\n     if [ -n $(pidof lxsession) ]; then\n        for x in /tmp/.X11-unix/*; do\n           displaynum=`echo $x | sed s#/tmp/.X11-unix/X##`\n           getXuser;\n           if [ x\"$XAUTHORITY\" != x\"\" ]; then\n           export DISPLAY=\":$displaynum\"\n           export _LXSESSION_PID=`pidof lxsession`\n           killall lxsession-logout\n           lxsession-logout\n           fi\n        done\n        echo \"if correct\"\n        exit\n             else\n                 exit\n     fi\n<...>\n\n\nTroubleshooting\nFor some unknown reason these functions don't always work. In that case you will have to replace the snippet above with the following one:\nif [ -n $(pidof lxsession) ]; then\n   export DISPLAY=:0\n   export _LXSESSION_PID=$(pidof lxsession)\n   export XUSER=user\n   export XAUTHORITY=/home/user/.Xauthority\n   lxsession-logout\n   exit\nfi\n\nThe environment variables are hard-coded in this one. Make sure to substitute user for your own user name. It should work for most single-user system configurations.\nHere's another workaround, just in case none of the variants above work. Replace the getXuser function with the following passage:\ngetXuser() {\n        user=`pinky -fw | awk '{ if ($2 == \":'$displaynum'\" || $(NF) == \":'$displaynum'\" ) { print $1; exit; } }'`\n        if [ x\"$user\" = x\"\" ]; then\n                startx=`pgrep -n startx`\n                if [ x\"$startx\" != x\"\" ]; then\n                        user=`ps -o user --no-headers $startx`\n                fi\n        fi\n        if [ x\"$user\" = x\"\" ]; then                           # lines added\n               user=$(pinky -fw | awk '{ print $1; exit; }')  # lines added\n        fi                                                    # lines added\n        if [ x\"$user\" != x\"\" ]; then\n                userhome=`getent passwd $user | cut -d: -f6`\n                export XAUTHORITY=$userhome/.Xauthority\n        else\n                export XAUTHORITY=\"\"\n        fi\n        export XUSER=$user\n}\n\nWhat does it do?\nThe powerbtn.sh script is triggered by ACPID each time the power button is pressed. As you can see it already includes a number of checks for common DEs like Unity, GNOME and KDE. These checks are there to make sure that the shutdown event is handled by the respective power manager. Alas, LXDE doesn't have one of those built in. \nThat's why we added a snippet of our own that does the checking for ACPID. If it detects an LXDE session it makes sure that your PC isn't just shut down right away and instead launches the logout menu you should be familiar with.\nWith these changes you should now be able to launch your logout menu with your hardware power button - without needing to install a bulky power manager. And even better, this does not interfere with other DEs in any way.\nSources\nhttp://www.ollie-reardon.co.uk/lxde-tip-power-button-not-working/\nhttps://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Acpid\nhttp://forum.lxde.org/viewtopic.php?f=8&t=205\n\nFurther reading\nLubuntu - power button doesn't turn off computer,\nLaptop power button not working\nhttps://bugs.launchpad.net/xfce4-power-manager/+bug/1008650\nhttps://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/87259/why-wont-this-shutdown-script-work-when-executed-by-acpid\n\nA: It seems that LXDE does not include the lxsession-logout package.\nInstall the package by typing this in terminal:\nsudo apt install lxsession-logout\n\nI know this is an old thread, but I just experienced this problem and could not find a direct answer anywhere.\n\nA: Using systemd.

How can I make sure to just run Windows again like always? I have a pre-installed W8 laptop, and since I had always had no trouble dual-booting Ubuntu with my older laptops, I saw no reason why I'd have trouble now. However, I see that W8 is giving Linux users a bit of trouble.\nAnyway, I made an Ubuntu 12.04 64-bit DVD, booted from the DVD, installed Ubuntu 12.04 alongside W8 (creating a partition for Ubuntu through the installer), and it said it completed successfully. \nMy laptop only boots to W8. No hint of Ubuntu. I read that turning of secure boot, running boot-repair in Ubuntu, and a few other methods might fix this, but I also read of so many users not being able to boot back into W8. \nI decided I'm not cut out for this and will just keep my laptop how it is - running Windows just fine.\nI'm willing to sacrifice that partitioned harddrive space, but is there going to be any issue in my foreseeable future with my laptop like this?

What exactly do I need to do?\nI made four ext4 filesystems and four swap partitions and created an array (of all 8), but after install it didn't boot.\nAnd on this thread, I read something about a separate /boot partition, but I don't really get that.\nCan someone explain this please? I understand the problem, but I don't know how to solve it.\n\nA: Your description sounds weird. Forgive me if I misunderstood.\nIf you have four disks, created eight partitions on them, and then created a single RAID 5 over those eight partitions, then you have not understood the concept of RAID at all. You would have no redundancy in such a setup, and a single drive failure would be catastrophic. You'd be better off without RAID at all than use it in such a broken way.\nIf you have four disks, the number of devices in the array must be at most four (one for each disk). You must not use the same disk twice for the same array. (It's okay to have separate arrays for swap, data, etc, if the disks are partitioned accordingly).\nThe Desktop Live CD doesn't really support Software RAID. You can still do it; if you know how to set up RAID manually and create filesystems on it and (after the installer ends) chroot into the freshly installed system and make it bootable manually. But this requires in depth know how of all processes involved. And it may still fail, as the Destkop installer isn't supposed to be used this way and may fail to finish the installation properly.\nIt might be easier to just use the Server install, have it set up Software RAID for you, and then proceed to install the missing desktop environment packages once the \"server\" system boots.\nAlternatively you could use the Alternate-CD to install Ubuntu. It's only available for Ubuntu 12.04 but nothing would stop you to upgrade to 13.04 after installing.

I know this question has been asked a lot, but I didn't find an answer here.\nUbuntu 12.04.2 64-bit was installed offline just a few hours ago on one ext4 partition, and a swap partition was also created.\nThe installation went fine, but now I can't get into Ubuntu.\nI want to use the Windows 8 boot manager, to select between the two operating systems, so I downloaded EasyBCD and added an entry for Ubuntu.\nThe entry shows up in the boot manager menu, but when I click on Ubuntu I get the following message:  \nNST/AutoNeoGrub0.mbr not found\n\nI tried enabling/disabling Secure Boot and restarting, but it still shows that error message.\nBoot repair summary Latest boot repair summary\nOut of desperation I tried to find a solution myself and reset the BCD configuration via EasyBCD. Now Grub boots fine and Ubuntu too, but I can't boot Windows 8 anymore.  \nThen, for whatever reason after installing all updates for Ubuntu, I restarted the system and now I can't boot into Ubuntu. Only via Live CD and the old Linux entry can I start it.\n\nA: First, the last I heard, EasyBCD was useless for managing a Windows/Linux dual-boot on an EFI-based computer, so I recommend you stop trying to use it.\nSecond, given your current situation (as specified in your Update), there are several possible solutions. The two easiest are:\n\n\n*\n\n*Run Boot Repair. I know you said you've tried this, but it's not clear if you've tried it since the change to the situation in which you can boot Ubuntu but not Windows. If not, it's worth trying Boot Repair again.\n\n*Install my rEFInd boot manager. Installing the Debian package in Ubuntu is the easiest way to do this, although it's a bit safer to try to use the CD-R or USB flash drive version first, and install the Debian package only if the CD-R/USB flash drive version can boot both your OSes. rEFInd is less finicky about booting Windows than is GRUB, so it might fix the problem.\n\n\nIf neither of these methods fixes your problem, please post back with a fresh URL for your latest Boot Repair run.\n\nUpdate: First, be sure that Secure Boot is disabled.\nNext, are you able to boot via the rEFInd USB flash drive or CD-R image? If so, try this:\n\n\n*\n\n*Boot to Linux.\n\n*Open a Terminal window.\n\n*In the Terminal, type sudo efibootmgr to find all your current boot entries.\n\n*In the Terminal, type sudo efibootmgr -b 0000 -B. This deletes the Boot0000 entry.\n\n*Repeat step #4, replacing 0000 with each Boot#### number identified in step #3. (Your Boot Repair output suggests you'll have 0000, 0001, 0002, 0004, 0005, 0007, 0008, 2001, 2002, and 2003.\n\n*Type sudo efibootmgr -c -p 2 -l \"\\EFI\\ubuntu\\grubx64.efi\" -L \"Ubuntu\". Note the backslashes used as directory separators.\n\n*If you've installed rEFInd to the hard disk after running the last Boot Repair, type sudo efibootmgr -c -p 2 -l \"\\EFI\\refind\\refind_x64.efi\" -L \"rEFInd\".\n\n*Reboot.\n\n\nIf all goes well, rEFInd should pop up, or at least GRUB, and you should be able to boot both Linux and Windows.\nIf the rEFInd CD-R or USB flash drive doesn't work, you could try the same from a Linux live CD that's booted in EFI mode.\n", "Q: fglrx issues with AMD Mobility Radeon HD 2600 XT on Xubuntu 13.04 The problem\nI have a rather old (~2007ish) iMac, which I've recently installed Xubuntu 13.04 (64 bit) on.

I'm open to other options, such as downgrading my version of Ubuntu or switching to a different window manager. Could anyone suggest any combination of Ubuntu and Catalyst versions that are likely to be compatible?\n\nA: I think you want to downgrade to (x)buntu 12.04, the most recent release that still used xorg 1.12, which is compatible with Radeon's legacy driver. Here and there were posted instructions for tricking Catalyst into more recent releases, but I haven't heard a success story in a long time. (Disclosure: My own Radeon graphics haven't gone legacy.

I just have an interest.)\n", "Q: MD5 hashing with salt length of 5 I'm newbie in Ubuntu and currently using it for assignment.\nI've checked my encrypted password at /etc/shadow folder and found that my encrypted password using MD5 encryption, but my problem is the salt length is 5.\nI've check various sites saying that the MD5 salt should be length of 8 while mine is only 5.\nHere is what I get when I run sudo grep <username> /etc/shadow: \n$1$azfpj$YXXDGBAymqqsBTl2nujZm.:15935:0:99999:7:::\n\nMy questions are:\n\n\n*\n\n*What is the algorithm if it's not MD5?\n\n*How come the salt length is 5?\n\n*Anyway to change the length of the salt?\n\n\nA: \nWhat is the algorithm if it's not MD5?\n\n\n\n*\n\n*Ubuntu by default uses sha512.

The server doesn't boot so I thought I would install Ubuntu server (12.04) on it, but when I go through the installation it doesn't find the disks.  I'm assumming this is is because the drives are handled by the ServeRAID-7k card.  \nI've tried putting Ubuntu drivers for the ServeRAID-7k on a USB to access while installing, but it didn't detect the USB drive so I'm kind of lost.\nHow can I install Ubuntu Server on this x346?\n\nA: I found the IBM software (for a bootable CD) to update controller BIOS and configure RAID all-in-one bootable CD.\nIBM Support Download page for software.\n\nA: I know this is a late reply but I myself have just got it to work with Ubuntu server 16.04,.\nThe link to the Firmware upgrade CD is correct, but not only does the CD update the firmware, it also is a CD accessed RAID configure GUI.\nwhen the CD boots up (after enabling it to be first boot device) it will open to the grey screen with an X in the center (the X is the mouse), after roughly 1 minute it will show you a screen that will tell you if your firmware is up to date or needs to be upgraded, if it needs to be upgraded then go ahead, if not just start checking the menus in the top right corner and you should find something about the RAID in there. i'm not in front of the server right now otherwise I could give a more accurate description of where to go.\nOnce you activate the drive in RAID it will then be visible to Ubuntu and you can install Ubuntu onto that server.\nI hope this helps whoever is trying to do the same thing.\n", "Q: gvim produces error when hitting the close window Everytime I close a gvim window with the little x on the window or Alt + F4.

The only difference between them is that one has an encrypted home folder and I guess it is the reason preventing the dash to index, search and display all files but the opened. I have already tried sudo updatedb as suggested here and elsewhere, and deleted the cache folder (as well as the program and config files) of USC as stated in a well reputed answer. After logout or reboot, the behavior is the same. Question is: how can I get the searching dash in the second case?\nLaptop 1\n\nSame search, laptop 2 (encrypted home)\n\n\nA: The files scope relies on two main data sources to return results:\n\n\n*\n\n*Zeitgeist is used to return recently used files.\n\n*The system locate database is used to search your entire home folder.\n\n\nIf you have chosen to encrypt your home folder, then your home folder will be an ecryptfs mount when you are logged in.\nThe default configuration for updating the locate database in /etc/updatedb.conf skips ecryptfs filesystems.\nYou can change this configuration by editing the PRUNEFS variable in that file, but note that this will leak the names of files in your home folder onto non-encrypted storage.\nUnfortunately, I don't think there is currently a solution (beside this alternative) that will let you search your files in the dash and keep their metadata private.\nIf you add the command alias updatedb-home='export LOCATE_PATH=\"$HOME/mlocate.db\" && updatedb -l 0 -o $HOME/mlocate.db -U $HOME' you then can run updatedb-home periodically to update db, or add it also to .bashrc to run it on every login.\n", "Q: Netflix desktop doesn't launch when I click on it I would like to be able to watch Netflix on Ubuntu, but on the website it doesn't let me do so.

This installation is handled by the wine-browser-installer package, so one solution would be to remove ~/.wine-browser directory and reinstall the package, as recommended above. Sadly, it did not work for me, and terminal output was still stating:\nwine: cannot find 'C:\\Program Files\\Mozilla Firefox\\firefox.exe'\n\nWhat helped is that I've downloaded Firefox for Windows manually, using the link, that displays, when you install wine-browser-installer package (in my case it was this version). Then I've installed it, using normal wine. It was installed under \n~/.wine/drive_c/Program Files (x86)/Mozilla Firefox After that I've ran\ncp -R ~/.wine/drive_c/Program\\ Files\\ \\(x86\\)/Mozilla\\ Firefox/ ~/.wine-browser/drive_c/Program\\ Files/\n\nThat solved my problem, hope it'll help.\n\nA: The same people who brought you netflix-desktop (which really works very well, you might want to run it from terminal and post the output) just released pipelight to integrate silverlight into linux native firefox - thus allowing netflix.  \nInstructions are found here.\nBut for those in a rush:  \nsudo apt-add-repository ppa:ehoover/compholio  \nsudo apt-add-repository ppa:mqchael/pipelight  \nsudo apt-get update  \nsudo apt-get install pipelight  \n\nAnd start firefox. \nThis is a beta release though so nothing is guaranteed yet.\nAs said previously you might want to give netflix-desktop a shot in the terminal and post the output.\n\nA: I have had this problem over several versions of Ubuntu from 12.04 to date (currently on 14.04) This happens without fail when netflix pushes a requirement for a new version of microsoft silverlight. What always works for me is:\nClose the browser netflix-desktop opened.\nOpen a terminal and issue the first command mentioned by @sickgemini\nrm -rf ~/.wine-browser which eliminates the entire contents of the .wine-browser folder in the users home directory which is where netflix-desktop keeps its settings and configuration. to be specific the content is:\ndosdevices        system.reg   wine-browser-installer.sha256sums\ndrive_c           userdef.reg  wine-silverlight5.1-installer.sha256sums\nprofile-settings  user.reg     wine-version\n\nIf you see something else there you may wish to save it elsewhere because it will be gone after running the remove.\nAfter eliminating this directory and it's content the next launch of netflix-desktop performs exactly like the first launch and recreates the necessary information.

When I do\ndpkg -l |grep python\n\nI see the old version numbers of the software I just upgraded via pip.\nHow can I ensure that the dpkg list reports the correct versions? \n(I assume dpkg -l needs to be correct)\nFor example, I upgraded ipython to version 1.0.0 using pip; however, dpkg reports version 0.13.2-1~ubuntu12.04.1  \n\nA: It is not the same if you use dpkg instead of pip. The first is a package manager for Debian based systems and provides means to handle packages and install packages from the repositories made by package teams. PIP handles Python only packages and installs them from the cheese shop PyPI.\nThe two methods differ to the versions which they install with PIP always installing the newest package version.\nOne method to list all installed packages is to install and use yolk: sudo pip install yolk and then issue yolk -l to list all packages.\nOther methods are mentioned at the following SE question:\n\n\n*\n\n*https://stackoverflow.com/q/739993/307826\nAlso these two questions talk about the difference of apt-get - pip for installing Python packages:\n\n\n*\n\n*https://stackoverflow.com/q/6874527/307826\n\n*easy_install/pip or apt-get\n\nA: You're looking at two different package managers.

I'm new to Ubuntu and Linux, but I found that when I right clicked and selected the properties for the file, and clicked on the \"Permissions\" tab, the \"execute\" option at the bottom was NOT selected for me.  Checking this box resolved my issue.\n\nA: This is too little info to give a good answer.\nOn the basic side if you want to execute a command on the terminal and that executable is in the same folder:\n./nameoffile \n(Note the ./ in front.)\nHowever if you have no execute rights set for the script they can easily be set with:\nchmod u+x nameoffile (adds execute rights to the file) \nThough this also demands a drive with execute privileges. Usually things like USB keys/drives do not allow execution of code on linux.\nThese are the most basic basics, since you say install, is your file really an executable or a .deb or such?

One can find these commands here and there but I am looking for something that induces all I need to run to have a properly configuration machine as good as the amazon ubuntu ami.\n\nA: That is a tough one. I can not provide \"the set of commands\", but describe how I would approach this task. \n.deb packages have priority's. Most of the packages have the priority optional, but the ones that are interesting here are the packages with required, important and standard priority. Those are the ones that are usually installed on every system. apt-get is one of them. You could scan the Packages file of the main repository for a list of all packages that are required and important priority, download all the .deb files and install them with dpkg -i. (I sincerely hope you do not have to bootstrap dpkg!) Then you should have a functional apt system. Then you should be able to use aptitude in order to install all standard packages.

Trying to reinstall Arch again, but can't use cgdisk to create partitions.\n\nA: Your fdisk and parted outputs both indicate that you've got two disks: /dev/sda and /dev/sdb. The \"GPT data\" error seems to be coming from /dev/sdb. I recommend running FixParts on this disk. This program is part of the gdisk package, which you may need to install. If it detects stray GPT data, it will ask you if you want to remove it. You can then exit from FixParts without making any more changes. You can also try running FixParts on /dev/sda, but I suspect it's completely clean of stray GPT data.\nIncidentally, Richard is correct about GPT storing a second copy of its data at the end of the disk; but given the steps you've taken and the output you've shown, I don't think you're seeing the effects of that data on /dev/sda; I think you're seeing stray GPT data in sectors 1-33 (and probably at the end of the disk) on /dev/sdb.\n", "Q: How to mount a Synology Diskstation NAS I am a long time Windows person, with a little experience in Ubuntu. I am trying to set up Plex Media Server on a new Ubuntu 12.04 LTS machine.

I’ve edited both GTK-2 and GTK-3 themes to make scrollbars more similar to Overlay since I don’t like a low-contrast wide scrollbar. So I edited gtkrc and gtk-widgets.css files to change the slider color to orange and the trough to white, but as seen in the screenshot below the contrast between the trough and a dark background is annoying.\n\nThe question is here if it’s possible to completely remove the trough or make it transparent. I guess the latter is possible.\nMy ideal is something like this:\n\n\nA: Transparent colors (RGBA) are possible in GTK-3 using alpha, so for making the trough transparent:\n.scrollbar.trough,\n.scrollbar.trough.vertical {\n    border: alpha (@base_color, 0.0);\n    background: alpha (@base_color, 0.0);\n}\n\nI don’t know about GTK-2 yet.\n\nA: I'm not sure I understood your question correctly but ...\nI use Lubuntu 13.04 with the Greybird theme (sudo apt-get install shimmer-themes). I've heavily altered both the gtk2 and gtk3 aspects to suit my taste. The image shows a bit of a gedit  window (top) and a bit of my file manager, Thunar (below). As you can see, the trough is not really distinctive.\n                                                       \nTo get this effect, if that's what you're looking for, I edited ~/.themes/MyGreybird/gtk-2.0/gtkrc and ~/.themes/MyGreybird/gtk-3.0/gtk.css and ~/.themes/MyGreybird/gtk-3.0/gtk-widgets.css.\nUnfortunately, I really can't say whether it's this or that hack that gave me the current look. If you're looking for something like what I have, try editing the files similar to those I mentioned by looking for things like:  \n\n\n*\n\n*GtkScrollbar   ::trough-border  \n\n*prelight_shade ... # shade level for scrollbar's slider, comboboxstyle(1), and prelight state with gradient_colors     \n\n*trough_shades     # draw gradient on trough of GtkScrollbar and GtkProgressbar\n\n\nThese are in gtkrc and I have commented them out in my theme by having # at the start of the line.\nThen, in gtk-widgets.css, my theme has:\n.scrollbars-junction,\n.scrollbar.trough,\n.scrollbar.trough.vertical {\n    border-width: 0;\n    border-radius: 0;\n/*    background-image: -gtk-gradient(linear, left top, right top,\n                                     from (shade(@theme_bg_color, 1.1)),\n                                     to (shade(@theme_bg_color, 1.3)));*/\n    background-color: shade(@theme_bg_color, 0.9);\n}\n\n.scrollbar.trough.horizontal {\n/*    background-image: -gtk-gradient(linear, left top, left bottom,\n                                     from (shade(@theme_bg_color, 1.1)),\n                                     to (shade(@theme_bg_color, 1.3)));*/\n    background-color: shade(@theme_bg_color, 0.9);\n}\n\nAgain, I've commented out some stuff (using /* and */).\nI'm not sure I've made much sense but, basically, just look for relevant stuff and comment it out or modify it!  \nI use gedit as my editor with a plug-in that saves multiple, time-stamped backups so that if I break something, I can revert the changes.  \nPlease note that some applications may have their own scrollbar systems and you'll have to mess with those separately.\n", "Q: What is the command for Package Manager | Settings | Repositories | Source code I tried to do step two of building Banshee from source, but it failed as follows:\n~$ sudo apt-get build-dep banshee\nReading package lists...

However, if you use my rhythmbox plugin coverart-browser, you can similarly drag-and-drop pictures onto your albums.\n\n\nA: Force stop your Music playing app. Connect your device to a PC. Use the search function to search your phone (phone storage or SD card where you store your music) for albumart.jpg. In Ubuntu the results appear as icons, in Windows right click - search . You can delete the offending icons, then use whatever app you use to try find new album art. You can be more specific by searching: \\albumthumbs , \\android\\data\\com.android.providers.media\\albumthumbs or each individual album folder.\n", "Q: Usb bootdisk files help I had files on a usb ubuntu boot disk that I would like to retrieve. I copied the files to a rar file on my hard drive. I would like to know if there is anyway I can access the files that were in the boot drive desktop, as I do not have the usb drive any more. Can anyone help me? \n\nA: You will first have to find the .rar file(s). You can use the operating system's tool for searching the filesystem to do this. You will be able to find the file(s), because they are on the same filesystem as your fully working operating system.\nThen, use a tool such as 7zip or peazip to decompress any files you need.\nI have no way of knowing where you could have saved the rar file(s) because I am not you.

But somehow in the boot up, I saw that it couldn't find the folder in that partition. I have certain programs that start on boot up and it requires the aufs filesystem. I was wondering if there is a way of mounting after fstab.\n\nA: I was able to solve the problem by creating an init script that will run at the begining of the init or upstart. I have to create a file in /etc/rc2.d/ and name it like this : S(number){name} where (number) determine the order of the execution o the script and {name} is the name of the script. Assigning a small value on {number} means it is going to be executed before the other scripts that have a higher {number}. Simply editing /etc/rc.local  have a 15% chance it will work because it will run AFTER each run level .\nWhat I do : I simply change the number of the filename of this file: S99rc.local which is located at /etc/rc2.d/ to S10.rc.local and I write the mount commands in /etc/rc.local file.\n", "Q: multiple /home mountpoints I have 5 hard drives 1.5TB and 4-750's.

To be more precise, the most recently mounted one will be the one that shows up, and whatever files were there before will be hidden underneath and not accessible while the second one is still mounted.\nEither mount the raid10 in its own directory, such as /home/yourname/raid10, or if you want to actually move the home directory there, then mount it somewhere else, such as under /media or /mnt, and run sudo cp -ax /home /path/to/drive to copy everything in /home to the new drive, then rename the old home directory with sudo mv /home /oldhome, and finally edit /etc/fstab with sudo gedit /etc/fstab and change the mount point to the new drive.  You can look up the UUID of the new drive with the sudo blkid command.  After a reboot, it should be using the new drive, which you can verify with the df command, and you can safely remove the old home dir.\n", "Q: Live USB: How do i save files on hard drive So I have never used linux or ubuntu before so at the moment I am just trying it out from a USB drive. My problem is that i would like to save files on the internal hard drive of the computer but i have no idea how. Everythime i try saving something it only gives me an option to save on the USB drive.\n\nA: When prompted to save something, you will usually (depending on the program) see a dialog box prompting you to click on folders to navigate to the directory in which you want to save a file. On the left hand side of this dialog box, you should see two hard disk volume logos: one for \"File System\" and one for your internal hard disk. From there, click on the one for your hard disk and navigate to the directory in which you want to save your files.\n\nEDIT:\nI now understand your question better. As you may know, the live session typically uses your RAM and then saves any changes you make to the persistence file. Even small changes can take up a lot of space. One thing you can do is create a persistence file on your hard disk and direct the live session to use that persistence file. It is not clear whether you will still run out of room, or if Ubuntu will be smart and write Steam's changes to the persistent file on the hard disk.\n\nA: *\n\n*Search for and run the \"Disks\" program from the Unity Dash.\n\n*You should be able to see a list of disks and partitions.\n\n*Find and click the disk partition you access from Windows.\n\n*Select the \"Mount Volume\" option to mount the partition.\n\n*Access the mounted partition from Nautilus File Manager.\n\n", "Q: Sudoers file, enable NOPASSWD for user, all commands Preface\nThis is a fairly complex question related to the sudoers file and the sudo command in general.\nNOTE: I have made these changes on a dedicated machine running Ubuntu Desktop 13.04, that I use purely for learning purposes. I understand it's a huge security risk to enable NOPASSWD sudo.\nQuestion\nInitially, my only change to the sudoers file (/etc/sudoers) was one line, a user specification that should have enabled nicholsonjf to run all commands with sudo without having to enter a password (see the line that starts with nicholsonjf):\n# This file MUST be edited with the 'visudo' command as root.\n#\n# Please consider adding local content in /etc/sudoers.d/ instead of\n# directly modifying this file.\n#\n# See the man page for details on how to write a sudoers file.\n#\nDefaults        env_reset\nDefaults        mail_badpass\nDefaults        secure_path=\"/usr/local/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/sbin:/usr/bin:/sbin:/bin\"\n\n# Host alias specification\n\n# User alias specification\n\n# Cmnd alias specification\n\n# User privilege specification\nroot    ALL=(ALL:ALL) ALL\nnicholsonjf    ALL=NOPASSWD: ALL\n\n# Members of the admin group may gain root privileges\n%admin ALL=(ALL) ALL\n\n# Allow members of group sudo to execute any command\n%sudo   ALL=(ALL:ALL) ALL\n\n# See sudoers(5) for more information on \"#include\" directives:\n\n#includedir /etc/sudoers.d\n\nHowever this did not work, and I was still prompted for my password every time I ran a command as nicholsonjf. I was only able to start running sudo commands as nicholsonjf once I removed nicholsonjf from the sudo and admin groups.\nCan anyone explain why this worked?\nIs it because the user nicholsonjf was inheriting sudo rights from the two group specifications of admin and sudo (seen below in the sudoers file), which were overriding the nicholsonjf user specification because they were further down in the config file?\n\nA: Run this command to never prompt the current user for a password when that user uses sudo:\necho \"$USER ALL=(ALL:ALL) NOPASSWD: ALL\" | sudo tee \"/etc/sudoers.d/dont-prompt-$USER-for-sudo-password\"\n\nIt creates a file called /etc/sudoers.d/dont-prompt-<YOUR USERNAME>-for-sudo-password with the following contents:\n<YOUR USERNAME> ALL=(ALL:ALL) NOPASSWD: ALL\n\n\nThis works because Debian's and Ubuntu's default /etc/sudoers file has this line\n#includedir /etc/sudoers.d\n\nwhich makes it process files in /etc/sudoers.d. If the command above didn't work, check that no one has removed that line from your /etc/sudoers.\n\nA: The line you added was overridden. From man sudoers:\n\nWhen multiple entries match for a user, they are applied in order. Where there are multiple matches, the last match is used (which is not necessarily the most specific match).\n\nIn your case nicholsonjf was a member of the group sudo so for him this line applied:\n%sudo   ALL=(ALL:ALL) ALL\n\nIf you want to override entries in /etc/sudoers just put the new entries after them.\nThe new entry should look like\nmyuser ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD: ALL for a single user, or\n%sudo  ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD: ALL for a group.\n\nA: As Vince has mentioned in a comment, you can use this line:\n%sudo ALL=NOPASSWD: ALL\n\n(This is different from the lines shown in those answers, and it solved the problem for me.)\n\nA: For a single user, add this line at the end of your sudoers file using the sudo visudo command:\nsuperuser ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD:ALL\n\nFor a group\n%supergroup  ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD:ALL\n\n\nA: As I was researching this, I realized that there's a line in the /etc/sudoers file that is not a comment, but a directive that makes any file or folder under the directory /etc/sudoers/* override the contents of /etc/sudoers.\nThis is a sneaky little directive, as it appears to be a commented line upon first glance. It looks like this:\n#includedir /etc/sudoers.d\n\nThis is how I've implemented the non-root, passwordless user in an ephemeral Docker Image for use in a CICD pipeline with the base image of ubuntu:18.04:\nRUN \\\n  useradd -U foo -m -s /bin/bash -p foo -G sudo && passwd -d foo && passwd -d root && \\\n  sed -i /etc/sudoers -re 's/^%sudo.*/%sudo ALL=(ALL:ALL) NOPASSWD: ALL/g' && \\\n  sed -i /etc/sudoers -re 's/^root.*/root ALL=(ALL:ALL) NOPASSWD: ALL/g' && \\\n  sed -i /etc/sudoers -re 's/^#includedir.*/## Removed the #include directive! ##\"/g' && \\\n  echo \"Customized the sudoers file for passwordless access!\" && \\\n  echo \"foo ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD: ALL\" >> /etc/sudoers && \\\n  echo \"root ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD: ALL\" >> /etc/sudoers && \\\n  echo \"foo user:\";  su foo -c 'whoami && id' && \\\n  echo \"root user:\"; su root -c 'whoami && id'\n\nWhat happens with the above code:\n\n\n*\n\n*The user and group foo is created.\n\n*The user foo is added to the both the foo and sudo group.\n\n*The home directory is set to /home/foo. \n\n*The shell is set to /bin/bash.\n\n*The sed command does inline updates to the /etc/sudoers file to allow foo and root users passwordless access to the sudo group.\n\n*The sed command disables the #includedir directive that would allow any files in subdirectories to override these inline updates. \n\n\nA: One can insert a string in one line without EOF formatting at end of sudoers file or remove with sed -i:\ncat >> /etc/sudoers <<<'PaSe  ALL=(ALL:ALL) NOPASSWD:ALL' \nReference:\nhttps://stackoverflow.com/questions/41298208/how-to-append-a-line-at-the-end-of-etc-sudoers-file-using-shell-script-without/70039824#70039824\n", "Q: Best NVIDIA Additional Driver Option Hello,\nUnder Additional Drivers, there are a few options to choose from, but which one is the best?\nUsing NVIDIA binary Xorg driver, kernel module and VDPAU library from nvidia-310-updates \n(proprietary, tested)\nUsing NVIDIA binary Xorg driver, kernel module and VDPAU library from nvidia-310-updates \n(proprietary)\nUsing NVIDIA binary Xorg driver, kernel module and VDPAU library from nvidia-304 (proprietary)\nUsing NVIDIA binary Xorg driver, kernel module and VDPAU library from nvidia-304-updates (proprietary)\nUsing NVIDIA binary Xorg driver, kernel module and VDPAU library from nvidia-313-updates (proprietary)\nThe last one and the one that I have selected:\nUsing X.Org X server - Nouveau display driver from xserver-xorg-video-nouveau (open source)\nThanks in advance\n\nA: Nouveau is the open-source Linux driver, and the community (you, I, others) can actually see or change the source code for this driver.  You could file bug reports against this driver, and the community may be able to respond to your issues with code fixes.\nThe other drivers listed are all proprietary (owned by Nvidia).  These are closed-source, so we can't see or change the code.  Only Nvidia can make fixes and updates to this code.  The higher the version number, the newer the driver; so nvidia-313-updates is newer than nvidia-304-updates.  The stuff in parenthesis next to the version just gives you a little more information.  Some people may have issues with the newest Nvidia Linux drivers, and may chose to use one that is a little older/tested.\nIf you are gaming, you might want to use the Nvidia proprietary drivers.  The newer proprietary drivers manage power consumption better (good for a laptops) and may give better performance.  However, there could be some glitches with the proprietary drivers; personally I've experienced black windows with some compiz effects in Ubuntu.\nIf things are working fine for you, you can stick with the open-source Nouveau driver.  From what I hear, the open-source driver for Nvidia graphics cards has gotten pretty good lately.\n", "Q: 64-bit desktop ISO vs 32-bit desktop ISO: EFI vs legacy boot mode So my understanding is that Ubuntu desktop 13.04 ISO comes in two flavors:\n\n\n*\n\n*32-bit (supporting only legacy boot mode)\n\n*64-bit (supporting only EFI boot)\n\n\nIs this correct? What I want is a single bootable image that will boot on both my legacy computer and my newer computer. They both currently run 64-bit software, but I can't get the 64-bit image to boot on my older computer.\nI don't really care if I run 32-bit or 64-bit Ubuntu, what I do care about is using the same USB stick for either computer. Is there an easy way to get the 64-bit image bootable in legacy boot mode for my older computer? Or is there an easy way to get the 32-bit image bootable under UEFI on my newer computer?\nOr, if the 64-bit image should just work in legacy boot mode, please let me know.\nThanks.\n\nA: The 64-bit Ubuntu live USB disk will work even if you turn off UEFI. The 32-bit version of Ubuntu does not support UEFI. So, if you are not having trouble getting the older PC to work with the 32 bit version of the Ubuntu Live USB, you can get both computers to run it as long as you turn off UEFI on the newer machine.\n\nA: The 32-bit Ubuntu is BIOS (legacy) only, whereas the 64-bit Ubuntu supports both BIOS and EFI boot modes. Thus, the 64-bit image should work on your older computer, provided that computer has a 64-bit CPU. The x86-64 (aka AMD64, x64, or EM64T) architecture dates to 2003 (with AMD's Opteron line), but it started to become popular a couple of years after that. Even today, some computers still use 32-bit CPUs, although they're mostly low-end or embedded devices. Thus, without further details, it's unclear whether your older computer is 32- or 64-bit.\nThe 32-bit Ubuntu should run on 64-bit computers, including most EFI-based systems; however, to boot on an EFI-based computer, a BIOS-based OS (including standard 32-bit Ubuntu live CD/USB images) requires that the EFI have a feature known as the Compatibility Support Module (CSM), which is a BIOS-compatibility layer. Most modern EFIs have this feature, but it's often disabled by default, so you may need to enter your firmware setup utility to enable the CSM (aka \"legacy mode\" or \"BIOS mode\"). The details of how to do this vary wildly from one EFI to another, so it's impossible to give simple and accurate instructions for doing so that apply to all computers.\n", "Q: How to have a server the makes a clients update and download software offline?

When you tell nslookup to look up google, it asks 127.0.0.1 (which is your dnsmasq), and then dnsmasq forwards that query to 8.8.4.4.\n", "Q: How do I install browser plugins in a centralized way? I have 5 users on an ubuntu box and I want each user to have AdBlock+ (and a few others) for both FireFox and Chrome.\nIs there a way to avoid logging in as each one with GUI and starting both browsers and installing the plugins by hand?\n\nA: Firefox:\nThere is a clean way to do this by simply copying the Firefox profile from the ~/.mozilla/firefox directory of user1, which has made the profile ready (e.g. this is the account with Adblock, etc. installed) to the accounts of user2, user3, ... :\nsudo mkdir -p /home/user2/.mozilla/firefox \nsudo mkdir -p /home/user3/.mozilla/firefox\nsudo cp -rv /home/user1/.mozilla/firefox /home/user2/.mozilla\nsudo cp -rv /home/user1/.mozilla/firefox /home/user3/.mozilla\nsudo chown -R user2 /home/user2/.mozilla\nsudo chown -R user3 /home/user3/.mozilla\n\nI tested this, and it worked. An alternative is to use Firefox Sync. However, that will keep all the Bookmarks and History the same if anything changes.\nChromium:\nThe same technique can be used with Chromium:\nsudo mkdir -p /home/user2/.config/chromium \nsudo mkdir -p /home/user3/.config/chromium\nsudo cp -rv /home/user1/.config/chromium/Default/ /home/user2/.config/chromium\nsudo cp -rv /home/user1/.config/chromium/Default/ /home/user3/.config/chromium\nsudo chown -R user2 /home/user2/.config/chromium\nsudo chown -R user3 /home/user3/.config/chromium\n\nChromium also has an option where you can sign in with your Google account and have all your settings, Bookmarks, and History sunc across your Chromium installations.

You get a message about lost memory errors when so many errors occurred in a short interval that the kernel was unable to log them all.\nA memory error is a bad thing. Check your kernel logs (/var/log/kern.log) for messages like this:\nEDAC MC0: CE page 0x283, offset 0xce0, grain 8, syndrome 0x6ec3, row 0, channel 1 \"DIMM_B1\": amd76x_edac\n\nCE indicates an error that was corrected. If your RAM has error correction, it's ok to have a corrected error now and then. But when you get to the point where memory errors get lost due to their number, it's high time to replace your RAM. The message indicates which RAM module (DIMM) is faulty.\nIf you see UE instead of CE, it means that an error was detected but not corrected. You may have corrupt data.\nIf your RAM and CPU don't support error correction, then the first sign you'll get that your RAM is defective is when you realize that your data is corrupted.\nThis is completely unrelated to apt-get update, that's just the command you happened to be executing when the errors happened.\nReplace your RAM yesterday.\n", "Q: ubuntu 13.04 64 bit AR8161 usually off net I have installed Atheros AR8161 driver from  compat-drivers-2013-03-04-u\nand can also connect to the network but keep getting disconnected.\nIn order to reconnect, I have to pull out the network cable and plug it in. \nwhat can i do ?\n\nA: 13.04 was released with the working alx driver, so just get rid of the compat-drivers package\nsudo apt-get purge compat-drivers-2013-03-04-u\n\n", "Q: g++ installation unmet dependencies error I am trying to install g++.But not able to do it.   \n    amol@amol-System-Product-Name:~$ sudo apt-get install g++\n[sudo] password for amol: \nReading package lists...

It's not a big hard drive so I have to be very selective about what I keep. This is not the first time this happens, but Firefox keeps ALL unsubmitted crash reports, as .dmp and .extra files. In my disk utility, Firefox pending crash reports take up about 13GB. This is very annoying because when it crashes it never asks if I want to send a report, and it doesn't crash often so I don't know how it fills up. I tried to navigate through folders to them and delete them, but it uses so much RAM that once it has loaded, the window won't even respond to inputs. So I used the terminal, removed the space in Crash Reports, and tried to remove all files that way by changing to the directory and using rm ./*.* and then I tried ./*.dmp and ./*.extra but every time I get the same error:\nbash: /bin/rm: Argument list too long\n\nSo I'm guessing it is too many files to pass the argument. Can anyone help me with a way to remove all these pending reports where I won't have to type in each specific report because they are very long to type individually. Thanks for any advice you may provide.\nEDIT: This is a new account, my reputation is low on this one so I can't post an answer for 7 hours which is stupid. So i'm editing to answer my own question.\nActually I figured out a way to do it after I posted this. But I'm going to post the way that I did it in case anyone has this same issue, or an issue with similarly labeled files. It is all about the labeling, which are labeled using a Hex format. For example below, I copied and pasted a few \n\n\n*\n\n*7fefb131-b757-f12f-072987c7-68919cbc.extra\n\n*7fefd48b-d795-1714-6ce8144d-17b5e21f.dmp\n\n*7fefd48b-d795-1714-6ce8144d-17b5e21f.extra \n\n*7ff02020-5bcb-b5c6-276167bb-0c1fa603.dmp\n\n*7ff02020-5bcb-b5c6-276167bb-0c1fa603.extra \nSo since there were too many files over all to delete using rm ./. What I did was this, to delete big sections at once:\nrm ./7e*.* rm ./7d*.*\n\nWhat this does is it goes through and deletes all files that begin with 7e, 7d, etc. Since it's hex you just need to go through 0-9, a-f. However, instead of going through the second part of each filename (78*,79*,7a,7b,7c, and so on) you could probably just use rm ./0*.* rm ./1*.* etc just going 0-9, then a-f. I hope I explained this clearly enough, I hate being stuck on something like this and I'm hoping I can help someone else. As long as you have files that follow suit like this in labeling, either hex format, or any format where a specific order is followed (abc1.dmp, abc2.dmp, efg1.dmp, anything like that) you can simply go down the list and take out large chunks of files instead of individual files. Good luck. If anyone reads this and has editing points, please let me know, I'm always looking to format better. It's hard to keep things clear all the time when I'm just typing exactly how I see it.\n\nA: Run following commands:\ncd /path/to/folder\n\nfind -iname \"*.dmp\" -exec rm -rf {} \\;\n\nFind command find all the file which end with .dmp extension and remove them one by one so this command take one file at a time to remove and find command pass all the .dmp file one by one to rm command to remove\n", "Q: How do I back up my ubuntu packages/settings/etc so that it can be restored from a clean install?

Consider backing up your important data first. Also consider whether it's a good idea to upgrade a Wubi install, or rather switch to a normal dual boot.\n\nA: Ubuntu is longer supporting wubi so I recommend you upgrade to a full install.

Start MySQL as root, just press Ctrl+Alt+T on your keyboard to open Terminal. When it opens, run the command(s) below:\nmysql -u root -p\n\n\nA: As you probably know, MySQL is a database server. That means, you need a client to connect to a MySQL server. The mysql command line program you are using is such a client. \nAs with many systems, a MySQL server has its own user accounts and privileges. So if you connect a client to a MySQL server, you have to provide an username and (almost always) a password. If you don't provide the mysql with an username, it assumes you want to use the UNIX/Linux username you are logged into your server as. For example, if you are logged into your server as 'joe', mysql tries to use the MySQL user of the same name, which is 'joe@localhost'. As you see, MySQL user accounts always contain the hostname you are connecting from. That is automatically added.\nIf you want to connect to your MySQL server as the user 'joe@localhost', you can do\nmysql -u joe\n\nWith this, MySQL assumes that the MySQL server is running on the same machine as the client (therefore, the 'localhost' hostname is automatically added) and 'joe@localhost' does not have a password set.\nIf the desired MySQL user account has a password set, you can have the mysql client ask for it with\nmysql -u joe -p\n\nAnd, for the sake of completeness, if you want to connect to a MySQL on another machine as the client runs on, you can do something like\nmysql -h my-mysql-server.com -u joe -p\n\nIn your special case, the MySQL user account the mysql client connects to the MySQL server as does not have the necessary privileges to create a new database. You need to connect as a MySQL user that has these privileges. Which user account that is depends on how you set the MySQL server up.\n", "Q: Ubuntu 12.04 \"connecting\" for 30 seconds, then gives up and says I'm disconnected I'm completely new to Linux, have a Gateway LT40 netbook running Ubuntu 12.04.

It's asking me to log in as user and guest session.\nI have tried using password as the password for user, but it didn't work.\nI can't enter without password.\nCan anyone help me out?\n\nA: By default the password for any guest user is disabled. So you don't have to enter any password for guest. \nAlso, by default, Ubuntu doesn't have any user named \"user\", only if you created one with this name and only you should know the password for this account in this case.

I came looking after an apt-get update messed up my new (very old stock!) PCduino. She worked great with the original Lubuntu on it, I was doing all my old favorite Linux functions and having a ball. Then I rebooted, and BANG! I couldn't do squat.  I could not log in as ubuntu as it wanted me to, it would not take the ubuntu password, so I logged in as guest and it wouldn't let me sudo or su.  So I began messing around and looking all over the web for a good answer, never really found one, but then it came to me, try ubuntu password for sudo on the guest account, didn't work very well, so I tried su with that password and I was IN! I quickly made myself an account with my name, then added myself to the SUDO list and I am again off and running with my new little toy.

I cannot change the resolution cause then the system hangs. Except changing it to 1024x768 it works. If I change it to a higher resolution it also hangs if i apply the resolution. VMWare tools should normally manage the resolution.. What is wrong here?\nThe display is displayed as \"Unknown\" under the display menu in Ubuntu.\nKr,\n\nA: Try typing in terminal: xrandr -s 1360x768 or whatever your resolution is.\n\nA: I increased the assigned graphical memory of my VMWare guest to 8 MB and then it allowed me to select the higher resolutions. A lower setting for the GPU memory will restrict you to lower resolutions only.\n\nA: I had the same problem. I had been trying everything but eventually tried the xrandr option - the command itself failed and I remembered this could be due to available memory. So I added memory (to 4GB) for the VM and the problem vanished.\nI had had a lock-up and crash recently (which pops up as a cause on a similar question) so all I can only think is that the memory got reset and I had not noticed.\n", "Q: What alternatives are there to NVIDIA and ATI graphics cards? Most long term Linux OS users will be all too familiar with the pain of using either of the two main makes of cards. For years I've had to put up with drivers crashing, features seemingly being enabled and disabled at the whim of the propriety driver vendors and turning your computer back on after an update to find your OS is as good as bricked.\nNow I have a new laptop with a dual Nvidia / Intel graphics chipset. Enabling the Nvidia 3D support is a real pain, but I'm not fussed. The Intel graphics chipset is amazing!! A real breath of fresh air! 2D is fast and smooth an I've never had a glitch. It puts my £390 graphics card to shame.\nSo. I want to shake off ATI and Nvidia altogether. My faith has been slowly drained out of body. So back to my question. What cards are available (preferably Intel chipsets) for my Desktop machine? I can't find any. I need Dual DVI support at the least.\n\nA: Well.. there isn't really much choice besides those two unfortunately. Intel is master in the open source front with excellent open source drivers. But they don't really have graphics solutions for desktop PC's other than build-in graphics in their processors..\nNvidia does have great proprietary drivers though. I never really had any problems with them and 3D performance is just great. Steam games run flawlessly and so is the desktop performance.\nAMD on the other hand.. it depends on your card. If you have a card older than the HD 4000 series than you are left in the dark when it comes to proprietary support. Their legacy drivers don't really work well on new Ubuntu releases. Their open source drivers are really good though, especially with the newest Linux Kernel where they finally added dynamic power management! If you use a new card (HD 5000 or higher) than it's the other way around: great proprietary drivers, but the open source drivers aren't really there yet..\nSo that is basically my experience with video cards on Linux.. :P\n\nA: I have been in the hardware business and am OEM for over 27 years, and I haven't seen any add on cards that have the Intel graphics chip-set, at least not yet.  And the only way to get them, is buying an Intel main board. The high-end boards have descent graphics controllers.  But with the higher end boards, you still have to add a graphics adapter.\nI guess it all depends on what is it that you want to use the graphics card for, decides what you can get. that being said, you maybe stuck with either ATI or Nvidia.\nOther Graphics card manufacturers:\nIntel HD Graphics is a series of Intel integrated graphics processors that are manufactured on the same die as the processor, together forming an accelerated processing unit.\nSIS Silicon Integrated Systems\nVIA S3 Graphics Embedded Cards Deliver Superior Video Playback S3 Graphics’ leading edge embedded graphics technology maximizes computing effi¬ciency and visual performance. \nMatrox Graphics, manufacturer's of the premier line of workstation 2D and multi-display graphics cards.\nI haven't visited the website of the others besides Intel, ATI, and Nvidia, and I don't know if they have a better support for Linux. \nLet me know if this answers your question.\n", "Q: If running 32-bit Windows 7, should 32-bit or 64-bit Ubuntu be installed? I am currently running 32-bit Windows 7 on an Acer Aspire D270 netbook (Atom CPU, 1GB RAM).\nI want to install Ubuntu 12.04. Should I install the 32-bit or 64-bit version?\n\nA: It depends on with Atom CPU you have. Some are 64 bit capable and some not. If your CPU number starts by Z then it's a 32 bits CPU, if it starts with N,D,S or a number then it's a 64 bits one.\nAnyway, the safe option here is to install the 32 bit version. You only have 1 Gb of memory, so you are not really gaining a lot installing a 64 bit OS.\n\nA: Better install 32 bit version of Linux. Your configuration may support 64 bit but you have less than 2GB RAM and not so powerful processor, so you shouldn't lose performance. By the way Unity desktop in Ubuntu 12.04 use a lot of system resources, better install Ubuntu 13.04 or the old style gnome desktop:\n1) Open a terminal\n2) Type: sudo apt-get install gnome-session-fallback\n3) Type your password\n4) Type Y when prompt\n5) Reboot and select desktop environment before logging in\n6) Login and enjoy gnome :)\n\nA: To be safe, you should install 32-bit, as you don't have much performance specs.\n\nA: Doesn't really matter in your case. If in doubt, just use 32 bit. As others pointed out, the benefits of using a 64 bit OS are not really of any relevance for your system. :) Also you might want to use the latest version of Ubuntu instead (13.04 at the time of writing) because of a lot of performance improvements to Ubuntu in later releases.\n", "Q: Windows 8 doesn't boot after installing Ubuntu 12.04 After installing Ubuntu 12.04 I used Ubuntu Boot Repair (as usual) to reinstall the GRUB and visualize the other OS installed (ie.

To have that added to Nautilus, just look at \nAdd Open in Terminal Command to Nautilus Context Menu \n\nA: The terminal is not for open files with it! You can edit/open/view files from inside of the terminal using commands like nano file_name/xdg-open file_name/cat file_name.\nAlso (maybe about this thing you are interested) you can run directly in terminal some executable text files (like bash script files). To do this, open Nautilus, go to Files → Preferences, select Behaviour tab and select the option you prefer for executable text files:\n\n\nA: *\n\n*Create the script in your favorite editor for example gedit\n\n*At script's first line put a shebang\n\n*Save the script somewhere using the .sh extension for example ~/Desktop/myscript.sh\n\n*Open Nautilus preferences, at Executable Text Files check the first option Run executable text files when they are opened\n\n*Double click to open the script.\n\n\nAs a reference example you can use the following simple bash script which prints a line on terminal:\n#!/bin/bash\necho \"I am running this executable file\"\nread -p \"Press enter to exit\"\n\nWhen you run the script, a terminal window will open executing the echo and read commands\nAbout shebang:\nThe first line in the script #!/bin/bash \"tells\" the system which interpreter to use in order to precess the command written in it.\n", "Q: How to add permission to write to /var/www for my FTP client I'm trying to install Tapatalk plugin on my phpbb3 forum\n\nWrite method for automod is FTP and connection is successful.

How do we skip over uppercase first word of new line?\nSo the correct result must be:\nI am andrew. You\nare jhon. Here we are\nforever.\n\nWhat if the sentence closes in \"?\" or \"!\" ???\n\nA: sed command is very powerful to edit files from shell scripts. With its help you can edit however you want a text file.

Something like\n$ cat myfile\ni am andrew. you\nare jhon. here we are\nforever.\n\n$ while read -rd\\. sntc; do printf \"%s. \" \"${sntc^}\"; done < myfile; printf \"\\n\"\nI am andrew. You\nare jhon. Here we are\nforever.\n\nTo handle multiple sentence terminators e.g. ? and ! as well as the regular period, here is a different approach using 'awk' - note that the RT variable that allows us to recover the particular record terminator which matched a particular sentence is an extension that may not be available in all varieties of 'awk'\n$ cat myfile\ni am andrew? you\nare jhon. here we are\nforever!\n\n$ awk 'BEGIN{RS=\"[.!?]+[ \\t\\n]*\"}; {sub(\".\", substr(toupper($0), 1,1), $0); printf (\"%s%s\", $0, RT)}' myfile\nI am andrew? You\nare jhon. Here we are\nforever!\n\nNote that the record separator regex above will handle multiple consecutive delimiters ('!?!!!') and optional trailing spaces - which the read-based version doesn't. \nAs a further enhancement, let's try to add rudimentary handling of quoted sentences by modifying the RS regex once more and changing the sub so that it upper-cases the first non-quote character:\nawk 'BEGIN{RS=\"[.!?]+[\\\"'\\'']?[ \\t\\n]*\"}; {match($0, \"[^\\\"'\\'']\"); sub(\"[^\\\"'\\'']\", substr(toupper($0),RSTART,1), $0); printf (\"%s%s\", $0, RT)}'\n\ne.g.\n$ cat myfile\ni am andrew.    \"are\nyou jhon?\"  'here we are\nforever!?'\n\n$ awk 'BEGIN{RS=\"[.!?]+[\\\"'\\'']?[ \\t\\n]*\"}; {match($0, \"[^\\\"'\\'']\"); sub(\"[^\\\"'\\'']\", substr(toupper($0),RSTART,1), $0); printf (\"%s%s\", $0, RT)}' myfile\nI am andrew.    \"Are\nyou jhon?\"  'Here we are\nforever!?'\n\n", "Q: After installing Nvidia the resolution changed to 640X480 I visited the NVIDIA website downloaded the NVIDIA NVIDIA-Linux-x86_64-304.108.run drivers.

In that case /etc/cron.daily/ was executed by /etc/crontab on 6:25. But newer Debian installations (and so does Ubuntu) install anacron by default and so /etc/cron.daily/ will be executed by /etc/anacrontab five minutes after anacron was started or every new day.\n\nTo achieve your schedule (from the comments) you can set up a cronjob that will e.g. every 10 min between 3-6 start either anacron that will take care that the backup job only run once or you can write a custom controll script.\n1. Alternative: anacron\nmkdir ~/.local/share/anacron_spool\necho \"1 0 backup.daily /path/to/backup.sh\" > ~/.config/anacrontab\n(crontab -l; echo \"*/10 3-6 * * * /usr/sbin/anacron -s -t $HOME/.config/anacrontab -S $HOME/.local/share/anacron_spool\") | crontab -\n\nThis will make anacron to serialize (-s) run all jobs defined in ~/.config/anacrontab. Because by default only root has write permission to write to /var/spool/anacron/ where the timestamps are stored we use a custom spool-dir (-S). If all jobs are done for today anacron will exit.\n2. Alternative: custom controll script\nOpen an editor (e.g. sudo nano /usr/local/bin/run_once_a_day.sh) and paste this:\n#!/bin/bash\nSPOOL=\"$HOME/.local/share/run_once_spool/\"\nif [ $# != 2 ]; then\n    echo \"Usage: $(basename $0) <job-identifier> <command>\"\n    exit 1\nfi\n\nif [ ! -d $SPOOL ]; then\n    mkdir $SPOOL\nfi\n\nif [ -e ${SPOOL}${1} ]; then\n    last_run=$(cat ${SPOOL}${1})\nelse\n    last_run=0\nfi\n\ntoday=$(date +%Y%m%d)\nif [ $last_run != $today ]; then\n    $2\n    echo $today > ${SPOOL}${1}\nfi\n\nPress CTRL+O to save and CTRL+X to exit.

So, if you set a cron job at which time do you wish between 3 and 6, this will run only once at a specified time. Only once, and never more than once!\nSee more explanations and some examples at: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cron\n\nA: I think the simplest work-around is to have a wrapper script being called every N minutes during the interval, but it starts by checking for the existence of a \"locker\" file it creates upon execution.\n#!/bin/bash\n[[ -f /dev/shm/cron-once-script-lock ]] && exit 0\ntouch /dev/shm/cron-once-script-lock\n\nactualcronjob.sh # or whatever non-script command it may be\n\n# end of wrapper script\n\nAnd the cron line would be like:\n*/10 3-6 * * * /wherever/the/script/is/wrapper-script.sh\n\nOr perhaps\n*/10 3-6 * * * bash /wherever/the/script/is/wrapper-script.sh\n\nThe only caveat is that cron runs under a restricted \"environment\" and you may need to export environment variables and this sort of stuff, but that's another subject altogether.\n", "Q: Is there a way to access my current windows installation within a VM environment?

Is there a way to access my current windows installation within the VM environment?\n\nA: Yes.  You need to use the microsoft disk2vhd program to create a VHD copy of your hard drive.  You'll likely need a backup drive to put the exported copy on.  Before you copy your harddrive, delete all unecessary programs and files.  Empty your recycle bin and temporary internet files as well as defrag the harddrive.

Simply put Ubuntu is open source and free for anyone to use, including commercial use. Nice, huh!?\nHowever looking at it more closely, you see that Ubuntu consists of a lot of individual packages and each can have its own license.

For a printer, you need to print the target and read the print to make a profile.\nI'm attempting to work through the process in my Ubuntu 12.04. I started by opening up the \"Color\" icon in Dash. There is some needed auto installs when initially selecting my Epson scanner and hitting calibrate. After the installs, hit calibrate again and the Gnome Color Manager opens. There is a pop-up to install shared-color-targets that fails. This sent me off to find a debian package, but only found an RPM. I used Alien to make it a deb and dpkg -i package.deb. The location of install is /usr/share/color and /usr/share/shared-color-targets. This far, I've just setup the framework for the Gnome Color Manager to function properly, but no color targets are present, and these must be purchased from www.targets.coloraid.de/. You only need one target to calibrate your whole system as it is the anchor by which everything will be made to match it later.\n\nA: Gnome color manager could be found on ubuntuupdates.org site. Here is the package for 12.04.\n", "Q: Run executable file on terminal I'm new to Ubuntu and currently on it because of assignment.

So have few queries about it as I am new to all this:\nQuestion: Will I be able to dual boot it with windows 7 home premium ?\nQuestion: i will make a bootable pen drive for this, so using a 1 GB pen drive(completely formatted) will be enough ?\n\nA: Yes, you will be able to dual boot it with windows 7, while installation select install besides windows, and using the 1 GB pen drive will be enough for making a installation bootable media, I recommend using Unetbootin. The Universal USB installer is also an option.\n", "Q: how to install ubuntu during boot up I'm trying to install ubuntu but bloody windows is making it difficult (Most of my programs stopped working after windows downloaded an update).  I tried to install ubuntu when the computer start up, even pressing f8 but it keeps going to windows.\n\nA: First, check that the button you are using to choose the boot media is the right one. Your computer's manual should be able to tell you what button it is. Alternatively, change the boot order in BIOS to first boot from the removable media you are using. You should be aware that some older BIOS-versions are unable to boot from a USB-drive and you need to use a CD/DVD.\n\nA: You need to get into your system's BIOS, and change boot order.  Here are some of the keys that might get you into the BIOS, F1, F2, F10, F9, , and Del.  \nSome systems will allow you to press F9 to display a boot selection menu.  So once you have your bootable CD/DVD of USB, change the boot order, anf that will allow you to boot form the choosen media.  For more information on how to install Ubuntu, or on how to create a bootable media, see Install Ubuntu.\nBy the way F8 , will display the Windows boot menu.\n\nA: The way I installed Ubuntu was 1) created a bootable thumb drive 2) booted from thumb drive (using the BIOS) 3) installed/formated the hard disk from the thumb. \nAlternatively, you may want to use the bootable thumb to retrieve your files before you wipe the computer. Ubuntu requires a different file system than windows and your files will probably be lost. \nHope this helps.\n", "Q: iso file size for 13.04 is larger than cd's available space The iso file for ubuntu 13.04 is larger than most of the cd's where we burn the file.

Take the File Manager for example, on a desktop with more screen space it will show the Places list in a side panel, while on a phone the Places are accessed via a popup from a toolbar button.\n\nA: I believe so.

Thus, it sounds as if you've probably got an EFI-based computer, although that's not 100% certain based on the evidence you've presented.\nAs oldfred says in his comment to your question, EFI-based computers generally boot with GPT disks, and GPT doesn't have the primary/extended/logical partition types; there are just 128 (by default) partitions on a disk. Thus, if you've got a GPT disk, it's impossible to convert from primary to logical partitions, since your existing partitions are neither primary nor logical (although they're more like MBR primary partitions in most respects), and GPT doesn't support logical partitions.\nOTOH, if the /boot/efi issue is a red herring, you might have an MBR disk. In this case, you can use FixParts, which is installed as part of the gdisk package in Ubuntu, to convert from primary to logical, with some caveats, as described on the FixParts Web page. Even in this case, though, it's not clear that converting primary to logical or vice-versa is really the best thing to do; a better description of the problem is necessary to offer advice.\nIf you want a better answer, you'll have to post more information. The output of sudo parted -l, as requested by oldfred, is a starting point. Still more information can be summarized by the Boot Info Script; run it and post a link to the RESULTS.txt file that it generates.

One has Windows 8 and Ubuntu 13, one has Ubuntu 12, and the other is just data.\nAlso GRUB which is not by default part of the Try-Ubuntu13 DVD when apt-get did has no auto-complete so I can't figure out what grub thinks the drive layout is anyway.\nIs that the end of my Ubuntu 13 - should I just reinstall Ubuntu because I can't boot into linux anymore?\n\nA: Answer written by the OP in one edit:\n\nAfter hours of GRUB trouble, this these lines solved it in seconds:\nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:yannubuntu/boot-repair && sudo apt-get update sudo apt-get install -y boot-repair && boot-repair\n\n\n\nA: *\n\n*Make bootable usb with supergrub or burn it on cd.\n\n*Start Ubuntu with supergrub (Boot => Detect Any Os => Select your Ubuntu boot option).\n\n*Once you have Ubuntu running install Synaptic package manager from the software center.\n\n*Open Synaptic and search grub from the installed packages.\n\n*Mark for reinstallation all packages that contain grub or grub2 (I don't remember which package was exactly, so I mark most of them).\n\n*Reboot and grub should load.\n\n\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\nUEFI only\n\n\n*\n\n*If Windows 8 still loading, enter in your UEFI BIOS boot options and select Ubuntu boot option.\n\n\nIt works fine for me.\nPS: Don't try boot Windows 8 from the grub menu, it won't boot. If you want to boot Winows 8 just open your BIOS boot menu (Example: For ASUS motherboards boot menu press ESC) and select Windows 8.\n", "Q: Something wrong with my `.profile` I recently installed a few softwares and needed to add their bin/ directories to my PATH. Nothing abnormal so far. But I decided to be smart about it, and rewrote a part of my .profile so I didn't have to copy/paste the same few lines of codes over and over. Here was my idea:\n# Create an array with directories to be added to PATH\ndeclare -a addpath=(\"$HOME/bin\" \"$HOME/.cabal/bin\" \"/opt/vert.x/current/bin\")\n\n# Add directories recursively\nfor dir in \"${addpath[@]}\"; do\nif [ -d \"$dir\" ]; then\n    PATH=\"$dir:$PATH\"\nfi\ndone\n\nI thought this had worked well.. until I rebooted my PC and got locked out of my session when trying to log in. It took me a while to figure out that it was actually because of my .profile; once I commented those lines out, I was able to log into my session without being bounced back.\nMy question is; what did I do wrong with these lines? Is there a syntax error? Is there an other/better way to do that? What happened?\n\nA: In the default setup on Ubuntu 12.04, the .profile file is loaded by /usr/sbin/lightdm-session. This is shell script, executed by /bin/sh.\nOn Ubuntu, /bin/sh is dash. You've used features of bash that dash doesn't support. Dash and Bash both have the same core features, but dash sticks to these core features in order to be fast and small whereas bash adds a lot of features at the cost of requiring more resources. It is common to use dash for scripts that don't need the extra features and bash for interactive use (though zsh has a lot of nicer features).\nDash doesn't have arrays, nor the declare built-in, so it's bombing out on that line. You can put the list of paths inline:\nfor dir in \"$HOME/bin\" \"$HOME/.cabal/bin\" \"/opt/vert.x/current/bin\"; do\n  if [ -d \"$dir\" ]; then\n    PATH=\"$dir:$PATH\"\n  fi\ndone\n\nSee keep duplicates out of $PATH on source if you want to make sure not to end up with duplicate entries.\n\nRather than add new directories to PATH for each program you install, you might want to set up symbolic links in an existing directory instead. For ~/.cabal/bin, you'll want to have it in your path because executables there will be coming and going; I'd put it at the end of the PATH though, to avoid potential conflicts with existing programs on your system. ~/bin is already in your PATH on Ubuntu. For programs that you install manually such as vert.x, stow or xstow is nice for managing symbolic links. See Keeping track of programs for an introduction to stow.\n\nA: I think that, in your case, the best practice to make your binaries avaiable as commands is to link what you need to the /usr/bin. Mess up with $PATH isn't ever a good thing to do.\nYou can use 'cp' to make symbolic links, recursively, like this:\ncp -rs $HOME/bin/* /usr/bin #This will link all non hidden files\ncp -rs $HOME/bin/.[^.]* /usr/bin # This will link all the hidden files\n\nJust adapt this to your scenario, using the same logic of your present code.\nEDIT: you can use just the first line of the above code if you set dotglob to true on bash. Like this:\nshopt -s dotglob #This will make Bash include filenames beginning with a '.' in the results of filename expansion\ncp -rs $HOME/bin/* /usr/bin #Now, this will link ALL files in that directory to the destination\n\nEDIT 2: As you can read in the comments below, is preferable that you use /usr/local/bin instead of /usr/bin. Read the comments to understand why.\n", "Q: Build Apache module in C I've a problem in building a Apache c module.\nFor compiling the module, i use the statement:\nsudo apxs2 -I/usr/include/mysql -i -a -c mod_aledav.c\n\nand the module seems to be compiled correctly, but when i try to restart Apache, the output is:\napache2: Syntax error on line 239 of /etc/apache2/apache2.conf: Syntax error on line 1 of /etc/apache2/mods-enabled/aledav.load: Cannot load /usr/lib/apache2/modules/mod_aledav.so into server: /usr/lib/apache2/modules/mod_aledav.so: undefined symbol: mysql_errno\nAction 'configtest' failed.\nThe Apache error log may have more information.\n   ...fail!\n\nCan you help me?\n\nA: Ok, problem solved.\nI've added a command in the statement line:\n$(mysql_config --libs)\n\nso the new statement is\napxs2 -I/usr/include/mysql -i -a -c $(mysql_config --libs) mod_aledav.c\n\nAfter restarting the apache2 service, the module is loaded.\nFrom the \nmysql site\nso a new statement is\nsudo apxs2 -I/usr/include/mysql -i -a -c -lmysqlclient -lz  mod_aledav.c\n\n", "Q: Share a Folder from Ubuntu to Windows in VirtualBox I have Ubuntu as my main Operating System, but I run Windows in a VirtualBox because some of my programs are not supported, I have Videos, Documents etc on Ubuntu and I would like to access them on Windows without having to copy them to Windows and having two copies of the same file.\nThanks in advance\n\nA: Since it sounds like you mainly need to access files from your virtual guest, you could setup a web-based file hosting service on both machines (such as Dropbox that has a good Linux client). This enables file synchronization between two computers, as the virtual guest is technically another \"computer\". Since everything has to be uploaded to the cloud first, this might not be so practical for larger files.\nAs a positive side effect you get automatic backups of the files in the cloud in case something goes horribly wrong with the virtual guest.\n\nA: Setting up virtualbox \"shared folders\" is the way to go.\n\n\n*\n\n*You will need to have the VirtualBox Guest additions installed\n\n*In the properties of the VM add a shared folder (use a \"machine folder\"), you can choose any folder on the host and give it any name (for the share as seen from the guest)\n\n*Within the guest you go to My Networking Places -> Entire Network -> VirtualBox Shared Folders to see it (you can of course assing a Letter to it)\n\n", "Q: Ubuntu 13.04 x32 Server CLI - How to Enable - Auto Login via CLI Ubuntu 13.04 x32 Server Auto Login via CLI \nPlease advise if there is a native option on Ubuntu 13.04 x32 Server CLI mode (Non GUI)  - Auto Login option\n\nA: To the best of my knowledge, there isn't (without reprogramming things under the hood in the getty layer or installing X -- the latter of which would remove the CLI-only part of the question).  \nUnless you are SSHing into the machine from another machine, in which case you can setup SSH keys to log you in automatically that way. \n", "Q: Install Ubuntu on a laptop running XP When I being to install Ubuntu, the only choices for the 'Desktop environment' are Ubuntu and all the other ...buntu(s). I don't see a choice for the laptop version. Is this normal?\nI am trying to install Ubuntu for my Dell Laptop running XP.\nAny advice or help is greatly appreciated\n\nA: It's normal. There is no special Ubuntu laptop version. Desktop and laptop use the same installation media. When you visit www.ubuntu.com to download Ubuntu, you are given a choice of Ubuntu releases using several different desktop environments. Any further customization that you want can be done after you finish installing Ubuntu.\nCheck the release notes of the release of Ubuntu that you want to download before you download it to make sure that your computer has the same or better hardware (CPU, RAM, etc.) than the minimum system requirements.\n", "Q: What are the steps to create an Ubuntu Live CD with the Server version?

Needless to say, I'm having trouble.  The desktop in question is an HP Pavilion P6-2738.  It also seems that I need to get drivers somehow for the ethernet adapter, but that's a whole different thread.\nI went into the BIOS/UEFI editor and disabled secure boot, enabled legacy mode.  During installation, Ubuntu says it can't install GRUB2, no matter where I tell it to install it.  I'm using the \"something else\" option and defining my own partitions.  I have a seperate 160GiB drive I'm using for it, so maybe that's the issue.  I don't know.  Any and all help is appreciated, as it's late, and I'm out of ideas.\nI'm trying to get it to dual-boot btw.  Probably worth mentioning :P\nUpdate:  At the end of the installation, it says it's completely removing, and occasionally purging stuff.  I got it to install grub to a separate partition.  I'm not worried about getting an OS selection screen yet, but just going directly into the boot selection screen and selecting my secondary drive to boot from, I get \"OS failed to load\".\n\nA: Your Windows system is installed in UEFI GPT partitions. All hard drive is formatted as GPT, so when you trying to boot as Legacy, you are not able to make dual boot.\nWhy don't you use UEFI-boot for installing Ubuntu? It supports EFI partitions as well.\nIt differs a bit from Legacy mode booting, but still works good.\nCheck this out\nInstalling Ubuntu Alongside a Pre-Installed Windows with UEFI\n\nA: Your issue is a lack of BIOS-Boot partition.\nYour disk is GPT type, and you disabled EFI, so you need to create such a BIOS-Boot partition during the disk partitioning.

But still get the same result. I checked whether gvfs is installed, and the latest version is installed in my machine.\n\nA: This is definitely due to the bad downloaded file. I downloaded 32bit version of Metasploit and installed. Though initial step worked, starting metasploit fails because of the conflicting of rubygems. So, I uninstalled the 32bit Metasploit and installed newly downloaded 64bit Metasploit. It worked perfectly and Metasploit can be run without no error. All problems solved.\n", "Q: Can I continue working when backup is in progress? I would like to use Ubuntu backup (Déjà Dup) to back up the whole system on an external HDD. Can I use the OS (make changes to files) while the full backup is being made? How is this going to affect the backed up files (for example, if I change a file during backup, would I have the new version of this file in the backup or the old one)?\nThank you\n\nA: While this is possible, I would certainly not recommend doing so. The most important reasons is that you're creating an inconsistent backup on two levels:\n\n\n*\n\n*Volume inconsistency\n\n*File inconsistency\n\n\nThe only viable solutions to this are:\n\n\n*\n\n*Use snapshots. This can be achieved using LVM or a newer generation filesystem such as BtrFS. This will snapshot the whole volume as if you were taking a picture of it. Changes/writes are still possible, but the backup process is being run from the read-only snapshot taken earlier.\n\n*Mount the filesystem as read-only and backup from there. Important downside: you won't be able to run your system during the time your root filesystem is being mounted read-only.\n\n\nVolume inconsistency\nThe volume on itself consists of the thousands of files which are in the process of being copied while you are still writing to it. Some application will get confused if the state of the individual files are inconsistent.\nLet's say an application stores the preferences in ~/.config/appname/theprefs.xml and the contents refer to an external file somewhere else on the system, let's say ~/Pictures/myface.png. If the preferences settings file is being backed up after the folder ~/Pictures is, then the backup might not work after you need to restore it some day later.\nFile inconsistency\nSimilar to how individual files can be in an inconsistent state, so can files in itself be as well. The contents of the file may change while you are taking the backup. Rsync and most other tools used under water for backup applications such as Deja Dup will not lock the file for reading. See also: How does rsync behave for concurrent file access?.\nThis may lead to disastrous results as the whole structure of the file could be corrupted. The chance of this actually happening depends mostly on the size of the file and the amount of write operations being performed on it.\nExamples on what not to do.\nCopy or back up...\n\n\n*\n\n*a virtual machine disk image while the machine is running.\n\n*database files (e.g. MySQL /var/lib/mysql) while the tables aren't read-locked. (For this example fancy tools like the Percona Toolkit solve this for you.)\n\n\nA: Yes, but your machine might be a bit slower from the backups. It depends on how for along the backup is when you edit the file. Just assume if you edit a file during a backup, that it already backed up the old version and your edits won't show up in the backup until the next backup is taken.\n", "Q: “Unable to locate package” errors for all software I try to install programs with apt-get install but always it shows same error: unable to locate package.

Done\nE: Unable to locate package language-support-fonts-fa\n\n\nA: Well, this is normal as long as language-support-fonts-fa is not in your current repositories.\nTo check if a package is in the repositories, use the following command:\napt-cache search <package_name>\n\nIn this case, you can download and install manually language-support-fonts-fa package from here: http://packages.ubuntu.com/lucid/all/language-support-fonts-fa/download\n\nA: Well, for your example it's likely that you're missing the PPA you need to install that package. The best way to add a PPA is to follow the instructions here. But to summarize, you would do something like this:\nsudo apt-get install python-software-properties\nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:ubuntu-langpack\n\nNow, at this point you need to refresh the package indexes on your machine:\nsudo apt-get update\n\nAfter this you should be able to add the package you want.\nThis is a bit different than the other answer in that package dependencies will be installed and that future package updates will be noticed and installed each time you do a sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get dist-upgrade.\n", "Q: Downloading Ubuntu to OS X, installing on a laptop with no OS As it says in the title, I want to install Ubuntu on a Windows laptop with no OS. I'd prefer to use a USB boot rather than a DVD. How can I create an appropriate USB boot stick from OS X?\n\nA: To create a bootable USB stick with Ubuntu on OS X follow these instructions:\n\n\n*\n\n*Download Ubuntu\n\n*Open the Terminal (in /Applications/Utilities/ or query Terminal in Spotlight).\n\n*Convert the .iso file to .img using the convert option of hdiutil (e.g.,hdiutil convert -format UDRW -o ~/path/to/target.img ~/path/to/ubuntu.iso). Note: OS X tends to put the .dmg ending on the output file automatically.\n\n*Run diskutil list to get the current list of devices.\n\n*Insert your USB stick.\n\n*Run diskutil list again and determine the device node assigned to your flash media (e.g. /dev/disk2).\n\n*Run diskutil unmountDisk /dev/diskN (replace N with the disk number from the last command; in the previous example, N would be 2).\n\n*Execute sudo dd if=/path/to/downloaded.img of=/dev/rdiskN bs=1m (replace /path/to/downloaded.img with the path where the image file is located; for example, ./ubuntu.imgor ./ubuntu.dmg).\n\n*Run diskutil eject /dev/diskN and remove your flash media when the command completes.\nAfter you complete all of these, just insert your USB stick in the the laptop with no OS and start the laptop. If your laptop does not automatically boot from the USB stick, you might need to change (usually from BIOS) the device from which the laptop starts up to the USB. \nSources:\n\n\n*\n\n*http://www.ubuntu.com/download/desktop/create-a-usb-stick-on-mac-osx\n\n*http://www.ubuntu.com/download/desktop/try-ubuntu-before-you-install\n\nA: You can create a bootable USB stick from any OS and it should work on any system. This means that if you create an USB bootable disk from Mac it will also work on any Windows PC (and not just on other macs).\nTo create a bootable USB system you should follow the very good guide you can find here http://www.ubuntu.com/download/desktop/create-a-usb-stick-on-mac-osx\nWhat the guide misses is that you need to double check what partition the USB has been formatted with. If you formatted the USB with some OSX specific partition table it might not work as a bootable drive.\nSo the first thing to do is to open Disk Utility. Select the USB drive from the list on the left and click on the \"Partition\" tab.\nFrom there select:\n\n\n*\n\n*Volume Scheme: 1 Partition\n\n*Click the Options button, from the dialog select \"Master Boot Record\" option and press OK\n\n*Format: MS-DOS (FAT)\n\n\nClick on apply and then follow the aforementioned guide.\n", "Q: How to run source on terminal start up?

I also changed the SATA option to ATA, but it's still not working.\n\nA: If by \"no drive shown\" you mean that the Ubuntu installer isn't giving you options for any hard disk device at all (no /dev/sda or /dev/sdb), then you've probably got hardware that's too new, and there are no Linux drivers for it. If so, then I'm afraid the only solution is to wait for updated Linux drivers. Such drivers might actually exist already, and you might want to try Fedora or some other distribution in the hopes that they're distributing them; or if you're more technically inclined, you could try compiling the latest kernel and using it with the Ubuntu installer.\nIf you mean something else, though, please clarify.

See the section of the Ubuntu Wubi Guide wiki called Which Operating Systems are supported.\nBecause you are running Windows ME on it, it is likely that your computer is more than ten years old, but it might be able to run Xubuntu in a dual boot setup with Windows ME if it has at least 512MB RAM and at least 5GB of free hard disk space. Otherwise you can't install any *buntu flavor except for Lubuntu, assuming that your computer has at least 128MB RAM and at least 5GB of free hard disk space. Because your computer is old, you should download the 32-bit version of whatever *buntu flavor you want to install, NOT the 64-bit version.\nThis answer by Mitch will take you through the process of installing Lubuntu step-by-step with screenshots illustrating what to do at each step.\n\nA: The Ubuntu installer through Windows does not work on such old operating systems such as ME. \nIf you have not already, burn the iso file you downloaded. Boot the CD. Click install Ubuntu on the first screen you see, be a bit patient for this to load from the CD. If you would like to dual boot them, you should have no less than 9 GB of space on your system. It will say to have 4.4. GB of space, but if you install such a small partition, you will have almost absolutely no space for doing anything on your computer. It will also say to be plugged in to a power source, and to connect to the internet. This is not mentioned, but you need 512 MB of RAM to run Ubuntu. You can use WiFi or Ethernet to connect to the internet, but WiFi may not work depending on your wireless card. Make sure the boxes talking about 3rd party software and updates are checked, and click continue. Then, MAKE SURE you choose Something Else, and click continue. If you mess up this step, you could erase windows. If you would like to completely erase Windows from your system, click here anyway. \nIf you want to keep Windows, double click your partition, and subtract 9,216 MB from the windows partition if you want to have an 8 GB installation. If you want more, multiply the number of GB you want by 1024. Make sure you have enough free space on the Windows partition. If you do not, please follow the instructions I am about to tell you for erasing Windows from your system. If you have a lot of content on your system which is taking up too much room, back it up and delete it from your Windows partition while booted on Windows. Make a new partition table with most of the free space except 1024 MB. The format should be ext 4. With the remaining 1024 MB of free space, click add and use it as Linux Swap. Click Install now and ignore any warnings, and set it up while Ubuntu installs. \nNow, if you want to completely erase Windows and install Ubuntu, or you have no choice, select your Windows Partition and delete it. DO NOT erase recovery partitions if there are any. Now click add, and use most of the free space except 1024 MB. Use it as an ext 4 partition as well. Now add a partition from the remaining free space and use it as Linux Swap. Then click install now and ignore and other warnings. Hope this works out!\n", "Q: 12.04 update and nvidia I've just have had nasty surprise of graphics not working after latest update (bringing it up to kernel version 3.2.0-52-generic). Apparently after the update it was expecting nvidia-319 driver, while it seems to me that on 12.04 nvidia-current points to nvidia-304. Thus I had to manually install nvidia-319 and uninstall nvidia-304. \nIs this because I've have messed up something in my configuration or is it known issue?\n\nA: Check this question, and similar questions first.\nIt happens when there are two different version of nvidia driver in the system. It is a known issue. You need to take care of the nvidia version of your kernel and the graphic card identical. \nOr,\nIf you didn't uninstall your previous driver version. This can happen because nvidia-current-dev is of version 304 and nvidia-current-updates-dev is of version 319 as reported. \nIf you've installed the nVidia driver from Ubuntu's Additional Drivers dialogue\n, try \nsudo apt-get purge nvidia* \n\nthen try reinstalling by \nsudo apt-get install nvidia-current-updates-dev \n\nthen reboot. \nIf you have used the .run file from nVidia's website then go to a console by pressing Alt+Ctrl+F1 and then run \nnvidia-xxx-pkg1.run --uninstall \n\nto remove the previous driver components. Now give a reboot and see if that works. If not, then execute \nsudo echo \"blacklist nouveau\" >> /etc/modprobe.d/blacklist.conf\n\nso that the default nouveau driver for nVidia chipsets are not loaded instead of proprietary one. Finally install packaged binary drivers by \nsudo apt-get install nvidia-current-updates-dev\n\nchekc this link as well.\n\nA: After you\nsudo apt-get purge nvidia*\n\ntry:\nsudo apt-get install nvidia-319-updates-dev\n\nThis worked for me, without the 319 it just re installed 304.\n", "Q: Find installed documentation Where can I find the installed documentation for a library that I have installed?\nFor example: in synaptic package manager, I have installed opencv-doc. Where can I find this documentation.\n\nA: In general each Debian package you install also will contain the resulting file location on your system after installation. Packages can be opened and viewed with the Archive Manager.\nAlternatively we may also browse a package content on http://packages.ubuntu.com where all packages in the repositories should be listed. For opencv-doc this will reveal the following file list:\n/usr/share/doc/opencv-doc/CMakeLists.txt\n/usr/share/doc/opencv-doc/README.Debian\n/usr/share/doc/opencv-doc/acircles_pattern.png\n/usr/share/doc/opencv-doc/changelog.Debian.gz\n[...]\n\nThis package like many other documentation files will therefore install to /usr/share/doc/<packagename>.\n\nA: In terminal you can type opencv-doc --help to get the help. You can also try in the finder located on the top left corner and can search there.\nAlso In Synaptics Package manager, just review the components under the Installed sub-tab. You may find your installed programs there.\nUPDATE\nAdding screenshots for more clear flow of actions.\n\n\n", "Q: Windows home server mount don't work properly I want to permanently mount my windows home server folders.

I know it works alright as it is, but I'd like a fresh start with my pc, without the windows part. There is only one HDD in this computer, with both Ubuntu and windows. i noticed that after I installed Ubuntu, my HDD seemed to have split into two partitions (is this of any point?)\nI wonder if I just format the HDD will i loose my Ubuntu installation? will it not be able to complete? will it not format the partitions? \nShould I just format the entire pc using a bootable usb-stick and then install Ubuntu likewise? if that's the case, is there an ISO file somewhere that will do both or will i have to do this in two separated actions? like ... first making a bootable usb for formatting, and then making an other one to install Ubuntu (again)?\ni have to problem to lose everything that's on the hdd whatsoever. I just need a fresh hdd with ubuntu, and the easiest way to do it?\n\nA: So, you want a new installation with just Ubuntu on the computer?  That is easily accomplished!  The easiest way to do that, is to re-run the installation program and choose the \"Erase disk and install Ubuntu\" option.\nIt is likely that you proceeded with just the default settings on your install.  Don't worry, that's fine!  However, the default setting is for Ubuntu to install alongside an existing installation.\nYou will want to create a bootable USB.  Luckily, you'll only need one usb.  Follow the instructions here:\nhttp://www.ubuntu.com/download/desktop/create-a-usb-stick-on-ubuntu\nCheers!\n\nA: If you want to fresh install Ubuntu and totally wipe out windows then all you have to do is create a bootable Ubuntu Cd or USB. Restart your computer and boot from the USB or CD(Depends on what you created) choose try Ubuntu live version. When you are booted in Ubuntu click install and now you can choose between installing alongside windows or format HDD and install Ubuntu, so choose the second one and you are Done.\nYou can also use Gparted to delete your windows partition(If you have installed Ubuntu in its own partition) and you will be left with ubuntu \nHope i have helped.\n\nA: So if I understood correctly, you currently have a working dual boot Windows/Ubuntu, and you want to get rid of your Windows partition.\nFirst, I encourage you to reconsider this decision; I find it's always nice to have more than one system installed on a computer (Mac/Windows), and as long as you don't actually need the space occupied by the Windows partition, you have nothing to loose keeping it.\nNow, if you really want to delete it, I don't exactly agree with Colyn on the point that his/her solution is the simplest, and you will definitely loose your current data if you do that. Gparted is a software able to manage the partitions on your HDD. This includes the ability to remove/format partitions.\nGo ahead and start GParted from the launcher. There you should see your Windows partition (formated in NTFS normally). Right-click on it, and chose \"Delete\". Then format it in ext3/4 depending on the filesystem you chose for your installation. Finally, click \"Apply\" on the top-left corner. You just deleted your Windows partition.\nAfter this step, DO NOT forget to run the following command to upgrade your boot table before any reboot: sudo update-grub.\nIf you want to merge this new partition with your current one, it's another story. If you want to, ask a new question and include the results of the commands sudo blkid and sudo fdisk -l (Note: please be very careful to write the last command correctly before pressing Enter, fdisk is a dangerous utility).\n", "Q: Hyper-V Ubuntu 12.04: Mouse scroll wheel doesnt work I've been trying to setup an Ubuntu 12.04 workstation on a Hyper-V virtual machine (MS Windows Server 2008 R2) and I need some help with the mouse driver.\nThe mouse responds fine in general: the cursor's moving, left/right click works OK and also when I press the wheel windows are changing and tabs are closing.\nEverything EXCEPT scrolling: Then nothing happens, except that the cursor's appearing on the upper left corner of my VM desktop and when I move the mouse it appears back where it was.\nCan someone guide me how to solve this?

And Windows boots from, repairs, or installs the partition with the boot flag on the drive set to boot from in BIOS.\nYOu should change BIOS to boot from sda and put a boot flag on sda1.\nEvery drive can have one and only one boot flag, but Windows installs boot files onto drive & partition with boot flag.\nWe have seen users install to sdb, but because BIOS was set to sda, the 100MB boot partition went on sda.\nWindow will install in one partition, but like to have the separate Boot partition, primarily so you can encrypt the main install. But Boot partition also has the repair console, so if installed in one partition be sure to make a repairCD or flash drive.\n\nA: The problem was solved by going into my BIOS and setting the boot order of the drives to boot from sda first.\nThe boot flag is easily set through GParted (and Linux apparently disregards the boot flag).\n", "Q: Where are downloaded files stored?

Maybe you start with MySoft 7.0 v6 which you want installed in /opt/vendor/mysoft7 and MySoft 8.0 v2 which you want installed in /opt/vendor/mysoft8 then you would build two packages:\nPackage: mysoft7\nVersion: 7.0.6\n\nand\nPackage: mysoft8\nVersion: 8.0.2\n\nto create mysoft7_7.0.6_amd64.deb and mysoft8_8.0.2_amd64.deb. In theory you can use whatever version scheme you want, but it would be advisable to conform to Debian conventions when specifying the version number.\nThen, if you need to upgrade either version due to upstream changes from the vendor, then you would build a new version of the relevant package and update the relevant version number. For example, if MySoft 8.0 v3 is released, you would now build:\nPackage: mysoft8\nVersion: 8.0.3\n\nInstalling this package would then automatically uninstall mysoft8 version 8.0.2 thereby removing the files installed from mysoft8_8.0.2_amd64.deb and replacing them with the files contained in mysoft8_8.0.3_amd64.deb\nIf you need every single upstream version installed at the same time, then you would need to use a different package name for every version. At this point, the package version number becomes irrelevant and you can just use 1.0. Each would need to install to a different directory, because a file can only be owned by one package at a time. In this scenario, you would have to clean up unwanted old versions of the software manually by uninstalling the relevant package.\nI am slightly unclear on why your current deb would try to reinstall if it is already installed (which, unfortunately, is the crux of your question!). It suggests that apt thinks that the version of the package available in your repo is higher than the version installed. Perhaps the size of the version number is confusing it? /var/log/dpkg.log and /var/log/apt/history.log should show you what is going on.\n", "Q: Using a flash drive to boot up ubuntu I would like to know if it is possible to put ubuntu on a flashdrive and bootup from that instead of burning a disc?\nThanks\n\nA: (Use at your own risk!)\nYes, it is possible to write the Ubuntu Live DVD image onto a flash drive, and it is easy as long as you don't want to boot it in UEFI mode but in standard BIOS mode.\nUsing UNetbootin\nA user-friendly solution is UNetbootin, which works on Windows, Linux and MacOS and provides a graphical user interface which even downloads the Ubuntu image for you and writes it directly onto your flash drive:\n\nUsing command line dd\nIf you're running Linux or OS X, you can dd the Ubuntu image onto your flash drive:\n$ sudo dd if=/path/to/ubuntu-iso-image of=/dev/sdx\n\nwhere /dev/sdx is the your flash drive.

It is almost not possible, but it could be that by update the newest kernel gets malformed. So it would be possible to return then via the next installed kernel into system.\nI only say this not because of Ubuntu, but of else distributions, where sometimes updates malformed the installation somehow. Ubuntu is quite secure and quite reliable with updating files. It belongs only to the circumspectly user or admin, to allow himself an additional emergency-mode for his system, besides the protected-mode.\n", "Q: Making the MainView fill screen on device I have been creating an app in the Ubuntu SDK. I want to make sure that the app fills the screen on the device (phone, tablet, etc.). I do not have a ubuntu phone or tablet to test this functionality. \nThis is my current height and width:\nMainView {\n    width: units.gu(100) \n    height: units.gu(75)\n\nWill the app automatically be set to full screen? If so, does that mean the width of the screen is set to 100 grid units and the height of the screen is set to 75 grid units?\n\nA: In non-windowed mode, meaning on a tablet or phone, the app will take up the full size of the screen, being anchored to the sides and the bottom of the top bar.\nThe width and height are only used by qmlscene on the desktop, meaning that is the size it will appear when run on the desktop. It should not affect the size of the app when run on a tablet or phone.\nYou can think of it as clicking Maximize when running on a desktop; even though you've set the size, the app can still be maximized.\n", "Q: which memory upgrade is best? Running Ubuntu 12.04 64 bit on a machine with ASUS M2N-e board,\nI sometimes receive buffer lockups when watching YouTube.\nI have (two) 1 GB sticks of PC2-5300 667 MHz of DDR2 RAM (Kingston) installed.\nWould it be better performance to install two more identical memory sticks in the two open slots or remove what I have and put in two 2 GB sticks of a higher speed rating?\nThanks,\n\nA: This is one of the rare cases where quantity is better than quality. I doubt you could notice a difference between PC2-5300 vs PC2-6400 in daily usage. If you are on a budget choose the solution that costs you less, the biggest difference comes from the amount of RAM.\nThat being said, having 2x2GB gives you room for future expansions while with 4x1GB you probably end up with all the slots taken. So a wise choice might be to take bigger/faster memory sticks. Of course check if the new memory is compatible with your CPU/motherboard.\n\nA: PC2-6400 is the bare minimum.You need to change to 800MHz or higher frequency RAM if your\nmotherboard supports it.Indeed quantity is crucial too but replacing the 2*1GB sitcks with 2*1GB 800MHz sticks with better CAS latency would make quite a difference.\n", "Q: Ubuntu running on command line due to insufficient graphics My problem is that when I was trying to install Nvidia drivers (some 301 version) on Ubuntu 13.04, it evoked a message\n\nUbuntu is running on low graphics \n\nAfter the installation (I am repenting of that installation a lot :(), whenever I reboot my laptop it shows only command line version of Ubuntu 13.04.

In tutorials and how-to's I often see commands combined. For instance,\nsudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install pyrenamer\n\nThere seem to be four possible connectors: &, &&, || and ;. Though the &  connector is clear to me (it sends a process to the background and leaves the terminal available), it is not clear what the difference is between && and ;. And I did not know of || until Kaya's comment.\nThe following questions deal with the difference between the two connectors, but do so mostly in the comments: \n\n\n*\n\n*How to start two Ubuntu applications in one go?\n\n*How to combine multiple commands in terminal?\nSo here are a number of related questions:\n\n\n*\n\n*What is the difference between ; and &&? \n\n*When should you use them respectively? It would be nice to see some use cases: if I want to run a command and then after it shutdown my computer, which connector should I choose?\n\n*What are their advantages and dangers? Robie Basak mentions in a comment to this answer that a command like cd /somewhere_else; rm -Rf * can have destructive consequences if the first element in the command chain fails, for instance.\n\n*If relevant, where do they come from? \n\n\nA: && only runs the second command if the first one exited with status 0 (was successful). ; runs both the commands, even if the first one exits with a non zero status.\nYour example with && can be equivalently paraphrased as\nif sudo apt-get update ; then\n    sudo apt-get install pyrenamer\nfi\n\n\nA: Kudos to Jack's cheatsheet for saying how this works clearly and succinctly.  But all of these things have a more general reason for being chosen.  You don't just have to memorize these facts for when you're doing stuff in the shell.  For more context you might also like to know that:\n\n\n*\n\n*; is commonly used as a statement separator in languages like C, C++, Perl, Java, C#, awk, and a slew of languages that have been derived from those.  It performs the same function in all of those: do one thing, then the next.  It is like a period at the end of a sentence.\n\n*& is used in C for bitwise AND so && was used for logical AND.  Logically ANDing things in C includes a feature called shortcutting.  Shortcutting means that for an AND that if the first thing is false there's no reason to check the second thing.  A single false item in an AND means the whole thing will be false.  In the shell that means it won't go onto the second command if the first one fails.  Or if the first thing worked, it will go onto the second thing to see if it \"might be false\".\n\n*| is used in C for bitwise OR so || is used for logical OR.  Logical OR's also feature shortcutting.  In an OR this means that you look for the first true thing.  So if the first thing fails it will try the second thing.\n\n\nA: Others have said it well. From a practical perspective, I often find that if you want to chain commands then you would like to know where something fails as well. For this you need to understand grouping in bash commands using the curly brackets.\nInstead of a && b you will want to write:\na || { echo \"a failed\" && false; } && b || echo \"b failed\"\n\n\nA: Using ; will execute the commands irrespective whether first command is successful or not.\nUsing && will execute the second command only when first command executed successfully (status 0).\nBoth are used on different perspective. Like for a longer process, say for an installation you need to compile and install it. you should make && make install. So the install will run only if make successful.\nSo for dependent commands you should use &&.\nWring bash, or commands with independent commands, use ;.\nSo if you want to shutdown computer even the first job failed use ; , but if want on complete success of first job initiate the shutdown use &&.\n\nA: a ; b will run b regardless of the exit status of a. a && b will run b only if a succeeded.\nThis is necessary and sufficient to answer to the first 3 questions. In particular, the 2 is too broad, and cannot be given \"one\" definitive answer - your best bet is to decide on a case by case basis.\nAs for the 4th question: They're Bash syntax.\nThere is no intrinsic danger in using either. Again, the definition above is sufficient. It implies that you will write && when b has unintended effects if a does not succeed. There is no need for further rules or explanation, IMHO.\n\nA: Cheatsheet:\nA; B    # Run A and then B, regardless of success of A\nA && B  # Run B if and only if A succeeded\nA || B  # Run B if and only if A failed\nA &     # Run A in background.\n\n\nA: Jack's answer is  very good rule of thumb.\n\nA; B    # Run A and then B, regardless of success of A\nA && B  # Run B if and only if A succeeded\nA || B  # Run B if and only if A failed\nA &     # Run A in background.\n\n\nI would add that in some cases, using these commands in a subshell  make sense when we want to consider them as a single unit or we don't want to couple some operations outcomes with the current shell.\nExamples:\n\n*\n\n*Concatenate the output of two commands:\n(ls foo; ls bar) > single-result.txt\n\n\n\n*Go into a directory and perform a command from there without changing the current directory of the shell:\n(cd target-directory && jar -xf ../my-jar)\n\n", "Q: How do I change directories from the command line? I'm try to change to my Desktop directory from the terminal.\nRunning\ncd /home/desktop\n\ngives an error in the terminal saying no directory found.\nWhat am I doing wrong?\n\nA: iBelieve's answer covers almost everything, but alternatively you can type \ncd ~/Desktop/\n\nthe ~/ stands for /home/$USER/ or $HOME/\n\nA: To answer your question mentioned in the quoted article:\nThe directory format is like this:\n/\n    home\n        <username>\n            Desktop\n            Documents\n            ...\n\nso your command should be\ncd /home/$USER/Desktop\n\nTo learn the directory structure, I'd suggest opening up the Home Folder app from the launcher on the left, and going to Computer and just exploring for a while. You won't be able to break anything outside of your home folder.\n\nA: Because I haven't seen it mentioned yet, it should be noted that all directory names in Ubuntu (Linux) are case-sensitive.  So even if you were in your correct home directory, executing a cd desktop should and will fail.  If you look at @iBelieve's post, you can see that the Desktop directory starts with a capital 'D'.  To get there, you will need to  specify the correct case.\ncd Desktop\n\nTo help you in the future, take a look at this Ubuntu help wiki page on using the terminal.\n\nA: The following bash builtin commands are equivalent and they change the current working directory to your Desktop directory from your user home directory:\ncd ~/Desktop               # my favorite\n\ncd ~; cd Desktop\n\ncd ~ && cd Desktop\n\ncd $HOME/Desktop\n\ncd /home/$USER/Desktop\n\ncd /home/username/Desktop  # where 'username' is your user name\n\ncd $CDPATH && cd Desktop\n\ncd `locate -b '\\Desktop'`\n\ncd $(locate -b '\\Desktop')\n\n", "Q: How can I fix Gambas3?

Press right arrow to change tabs until you come across secure boot. if it is enabled then disable it. If this works then you might want to disable fast startup as well once you're in Windows.\nHowever disabling fast startup is completely optional. Windows will boot properly even if it is enabled. fast startup should be disabled for those who use files on both Windows and Ubuntu. Or else you might get an Unable to mount the drive error.\n\nA: Try preparing a USB flash drive or CD-R with my rEFInd boot manager. (Download links for both types of media appear on the download page I've just referenced.) Boot from it. Chances are it will give you two Windows icons with different descriptions. If you're able to boot to Windows from rEFInd using any icon, try installing rEFInd in Ubuntu using the Debian package file. If rEFInd doesn't work or if it works partially but has its own problems, post back with details. (You might want to edit your original question, especially if the problem is complex.) Note that you can adjust the entries that rEFInd shows by cleaning out unwanted boot loaders (files with .efi extensions) from the /boot/efi/EFI directory tree (in Linux) or by editing /boot/efi/EFI/refind/refind.conf and uncommenting and adjusting the dont_scan_files and/or dont_scan_dirs options.\n", "Q: Cannot create a new document in /var/www I'm unable to create a new document in /var/www/\nI followed this tutorial :- How to avoid using sudo when working in /var/www?\nand did as suggested, but still I'm unable to make a new document.\nAny suggestions ?\n\nA: You need root permissions to write to /var/www folder.

But because the last corruption occurred during the GRUB 1.99 update (and subsequent auto-invocation of update-grub) I am worried each time I see a new kernel pushed out.  I have been removing my Win-7 volume before updating the kernel just to be safe, so that there is no way GRUB even sees it.\nBut is there a way to permanently tell GRUB that under no circumstances should it touch the Windows Volume?

You should change that setting.\nTo see what drive grub2 uses see this line   - grub-pc/install_devices:\nsudo debconf-show grub-pc\n\nsudo grub-probe -t device /boot/grub\n\nIf you un-select everything or install to a partition which we never recommend, it will not reinstall to a drive's MBR. \nRe-check with above on install_device setting.\nto get grub2 to remember where to reinstall on updates:\nsudo dpkg-reconfigure grub-pc\n\nEnter thru first pages,spacebar to choose/unchoose drive, enter to accept, do not choose partitions\n", "Q: Sending commands from Ubuntu to Windows On our home network we have one Windows 7 only PC and several computers with Ubuntu 13.04 (dual boot with backup Windows 7 for programs that can't be run using wine).\nWe want to be able to send commands (like msg or shutdown etc.) to that Windows PC (and if possible we want that Windows 7 PC to be able to send commands to the Linux PCs).\nHow do I do this?\n\nA: You reminded me about winexe:\nDownload the tarball from the project page at http://sourceforge.net/projects/winexe/\nwget \"http://downloads.sourceforge.net/project/winexe/winexe-1.00.tar.gz?r=http%3A%2F%2Fsourceforge.net%2Fprojects%2Fwinexe%2F&ts=1377024055&use_mirror=hivelocity\"\n\nI'm using a hot link for illustrative propose.\n\n\n*\n\n*Untar the file:\ntar zxf winexe*.tar.gz\ncd winexe*\n\n\n*Configure it:\n./autogen.sh\n./configure\n\n\n*Make it:\nmake\n\nThen you can either install it, or running it with ./winexe:\n./winexe  -U \"Administrator\" //some-pc 'shutdown.exe'\n\nIt follows the same syntax as psexec Microsoft tool.\n\nA: If you install cygwin on windows machines, and also install sshd, then you will be able to give any remote commands through ssh.

Specifically the recent LinuxActionShow \"review\" of Elementary OS Luna. And about 8 or 9 minutes into the video. The sound just cut out completely. And now no sound plays at all. MP3 files, Ogg sound files, any movies of any format. No game sounds nothing. \nRestarting does not fix it, and Pulse Audio settings are all as they should be. And yes I tried changing them and switching around just to see if it might do anything. NOTHING.\nSo to make sure my speaker were not busted, I installed Elementary OS on a thumb drive, plus I wanted to try it anyway. Sound worked just fine with not settings changes. So I wanted to go ahead and finish watching the LAS review of E-OS, so I went into my system's drive and install necessary drivers. And it worked find and sound was good. Until part way through it happened again. And I don't think it was at the same time mark either. But since I made a persistence on this Live thumb drive, rebooting into Elementary OS as a Live instance also doesn't bring sound back. Its just gone. No MP3 sound, OGG sound or anything.\nTo me, this can not be a BIOS hardware setting since nothing was changed before booting into the Live USB. But anything settings should be reflected in Pulse Audio or other Sound menus right?? or is there a deeper \"Kernel\" setting I need to be aware of?\nThis is a very concerning issue, and the only way I see to fix it so far, is reinstall, and I will wipe a 2 year old install just because of sound, especially if its something that will probably happen again. I can add screen shots of my Sound settings if need be, but I am very familiar with what they are normally and like I said, I was no where near the keyboard or mouse when this began. Just a instant cut out of all sound.\nThank you and God Bless.\nUpdate I tried headphones and they work fine. The Sound settings are updated to reflect the \"Headphone\" status. But if I manually in switch back to \"Speakers\" in settings, leaving the headphones plugged in. The sound stays coming out the headphones despite the change. Uplugging the headphones stops all sound again and nothing is muted. This is extremely strange.\nUpdate #2\nI'm sorry RolandiXor, but this did not fix my problem. I was hoping that terminal program would help, but all the settings were fine. I just couldn't remember how to bring it up. Here is a screen shot of what I was seeing. I know nothing is muted.\n\nAlso, it is not the headphones that is the problem. Headphones are the ONLY thing that works. The speakers don't. And I am almost positive its not a broken speaker because it suddenly cut out while watching a WebM video. No popping or weird noise. Just all the sudden no sound while I was sitting not touching the computer at all. Also, when I'm looking at the PulseAudio controller. It shows that the sound is playing with the bar that moves as a song or a video plays. Speakers are selected, not muted, but no sound at all. :-(\nUpdate #3 and Final\nTook the laptop to a repair shop, as many other things were going wrong, and turns out the hardware Wal-Mart sells is extremely low quaility motherboards and other parts, that have been marked up to standard quality prices. Capacitors that burn out very easy, and the like. The laptop is now waiting to be recycled. So seems like this was a hardware problem after all. Sorry to all that worked so hard to help. It just seemed like it had to be software related, as the 2 times it cut out, then came back, were at the exact same time stamp of a particular video file. Once on the HDD installed Ubuntu, then the second cut out was on a LiveUSB instance. Where the moment I booted into the LiveUSB sound worked fine, then cut out once the said video was played. But never came back. Since then I've using the HDD out of it as a portable LIVE Drive, that I can take anywhere with me to have full size storage to boot into from any computer. Nice backup system.\n\nA: Run alsamixer in a terminal, and then ensure that PCM is not muted:\n\nYou may also need to check the volume of other settings depending on your sound card. To ensure you only do this for outputs, press F3, then raise the volume of each one using your arrow keys to select or raise the volume.\nYour update gave me the answer.\nUsing alsamixer, look for the headphone jack sense option and ensure that it is unmuted. If muted, it will be marked \"MM\"\n", "Q: FTP Permissions read but not write I made a personal FTP server on an old laptop but when I connect I can only read/download no upload.

It seems some blogs recommend installing pip and setuptools(actually distribute on Ubuntu) with:\n    $ sudo apt-get install python-pip python-setuptools\n\nAnd then upgrading them with:\n    $ sudo pip install -U pip\n    $ sudo pip install -U setuptools\n\nThis has some advantages compared to installing them with ez_setup.py and get-pip.py. For example if I install a package that depends on pip/setuptools with apt-get, it won't try to install the old versions of them because as far as it is concerned they are already installed.\nWhat I want to know is, will this cause any trouble for me in the future (ex: when upgrading Ubuntu to a newer release)?\n\nA: While it is safer to use .deb packages, in Python this may be so true since there is the VirtualEnv solution and the preferred PIP packager downloading packages from the official repositories (PyPI)\nUsing VirtualEnv and  PIP you keep your system's Python installation clean since you can install packages with PIP inside virtualenv, in case something goes wrong, you can delete the virtualenv and start over.\nAdditionally moving packages between virtualenvs is very easy with PIP since PIP can export the installed packages in a text file (see requirements.txt) and can import them back in a clean Python system.\nYou may want to see the following answers - question talking about PIP, dpkg, apt-get and other distributing solutions:\n\n\n*\n\n*After PIP install --upgrade Dpkg still lists old python packages\n\n*https://stackoverflow.com/q/6874527/307826\n\n*easy_install/pip or apt-get\n", "Q: Will hardware changes affect system?

Furthermore, doesn't exist language flag at the right up corner.\n\n\n*\n\n*How to solve this trouble?\n\n*Or how to make language support accessible for all users?\n\nA: There are two places where language settings for a user are handled.\n\n\n*\n\n*From account settings, where you (as administrator) can set the default language for any user (even after the user existed and worked for some time)\n\n\n*For every user individually via Language settings, where he can drag his preferred language to the top (Everything below English gets ignored)\n\n\nA: I don't know if this will help or not, but when I select System Settings > Language Support, then the attached screen is displayed. There is an option to Apply System wide. That should make the languages available to all users.\nThis might solve your problem. Please note that you need to be signed in as a user who has administrative privileges.\nHope this helps,\n\n\nA: Only Lucid use language-support-* packages. From Precise onwards you need to use language-pack-*:\nsudo apt-get install language-pack-ru\n\nThis is a package available from Lucid onwards.\n\nnazar_art@nazar-desctop:/home/andriy$ apt-get install language-pack-ua\nE: Could not open lock file /var/lib/dpkg/lock - open (13: Permission denied)\nE: Unable to lock the administration directory (/var/lib/dpkg/), are you root?\n\nThis is because you are not running as root. You need to use sudo.\n\nlanguage-pack-uk is already the newest version.\n\nYou already have the latest UK english language pack.\n", "Q: Where does Ubuntu store the cache of MAC addresses for interface numbering? Example: I run Ubu in a VM.  I remove and add several network cards.  Suddenly, I'm at eth4.  I want to migrate this VM to openstack.  How can I find/purge the MAC address cache for interfaces, so a vm behaves as I would expect?\n\nA: I suggest you edit the file /etc/udev/rules.d/70-persistent-net.rules. I'd remove all the lines for previous, no longer installed network cards; change the current interface, for example eth4, to eth0 and reboot.\n", "Q: Alias cd and ls with support for spaces and arguments So I started with this discussion, and it basically does exactly what I want. \nHowever, the solution to preserve directory whitespace using quotes fails when using arguments, e.g. cd -P dir. Any ideas for preserving whitespace and allowing for option flags?\nThis is the function I'm currently using.\nfunction cd {\n    new_directory=\"$*\";\n    if [ $# -eq 0 ]; then \n        new_directory=${HOME};\n    fi;\n    builtin cd \"${new_directory}\" && ls;\n}\n\nFor example, with the above, cd -P My\\ Documents/ becomes cd \"-P My Documents\" which obviously fails.\n\nA: When you write $*, you've lost: this erases the distinction between spaces in an argument and spaces to separate arguments. Use \"$@\" instead, which expands to one word per argument.\nfunction cd {\n  builtin cd \"$@\" && ls\n}\n\n"]
