["Q: Ubuntu 12.10 grahical issues when dual booting with OS X, Mac OS X left unbootable I have been trying to dual boot OS X and Ubuntu on my MacBook Pro 7,1 and have found a few issues. First of all, I am using this guide. http://lifehacker.com/5934942/how-to-dual-boot-linux-on-your-mac-and-take-back-your-powerhouse-apple-hardware I have just installed Ubuntu and rebooted. I saw GRUB instead of rEFIt. When selecting Ubuntu and logging in, I get graphical glitches.\nThe glitches vary, and sometimes I get one before I hit the login screen.\nWhen I try to boot OS X I get this:\n\nHowever, I can get a terminal working nice!\nSo, my questions are: how do I get Ubuntu to work without graphic issues and how can I get OS X to boot again and preferably use rEFIt as the guide intended to boot the 2?\nQuick Update: I have successfully booted OS X 10.8! I held option when starting, selected my OS X hard drive and from there it started rEFIt. I selected OS X and it booted as normal! Now I just need Ubuntu to work correctly.\nUpdate 2: rEFIt now appears on startup, and the only issues is the Ubuntu graphics. If I can get unity to start correctly, and all the graphics to be displayed nicely, I'll be good. Yay, progress!\nUpdate 3: In the process of reinstalling Ubuntu.\n\nA: Ok so there is an OSX entry. Have you tried selecting the OS X entry instead of the Ubuntu/Linux entry (using the arrow keys)? What happens then? UPDATE: Yes you have, but you get an error, you have updated that in your question\nUpdate 1\nOk so from your updates it looks like you've made some progress; I'm relieved that you didn't wipe out your OS X partition! Also, putting rEFIt on is great as well. Could you specify (a) what MacBook Pro model you have (something like 6,2 or Mid 2010 which can be found by going to the upper left hand corner, clicking the Apple, click About This Mac >> More Info, and there it will say something like \"Mid 2010') and (b) what version of Ubuntu?\nIf you can't solve your graphics problem (I would try googling it), then best bet would be to reinstall Ubuntu. I can help with specific install instructions for Mac, if you want. I've done this quite a few times. One thing - the Graphics problem might be because of what model your Mac is / if you installed it with EFI or BIOS support. Did you use the normal Ubuntu install disk, or the special Macintosh one?\nI always use the Non-Mac version. The Normal version. I would advise that you do as well. It appears on the Ubuntu Apple hardware page (help.ubuntu.com/community/MacBookPro7-1/Quantal) that your 7,1 is supported quite well under 12.10. I would wipe out Ubuntu and then reinstall it and see how it goes.\nUpdate 2\nYou say:\n\nI've run into a couple roadblocks. 1. I went into disk utility and attempted to remove both the main Ubuntu partition and its swap. The swap refuses to be removed. 2. I somehow removed my Recovery Partition, is there any way to get this back? 3. Is there something else I should do to uninstall? rEFIt still has Ubuntu as an option (this may go away once I get rid of the swap) \n\nAlright... \n\n\n*\n\n*I don't know why Disk Utility won't remove the swap partition. Just to clarify, you open Disk Utility, select your hard drive in the left-hand pane, then click on the \"Partition\" Tab, then select the Swap partition (whatever you named it) in the little graphic / table describing all your partitions on that drive (NOT in the left hand pane) under the title \"Partition Layout\" and click the small \"-\" button below the graphic / table and follow the prompts? Please give the error you receive if this doesn't work.\n\n*I, too, have accidentally removed my recovery partition. Bummer. The only (safe) way to recreate the partition (or any way that I trust; you can Google the problem, but some of the ways online with custom scripts from other people seem a little sketchy) is to reinstall Mac OS X. This is actually not as bad as you think; you need to re-download your version of OS X (I assume Lion or Mountain Lion) from the Mac App Store, rerun the install. All your files and configs will be the same. Make sure you wipe out all the partitions after your main Mac one, though, first (including swap).\nThen your recovery partition will be back where it started. Then you can reinstall Ubuntu. Also, when installing, at least when I installed Ubuntu 12.04 on my Mac, I did not use a swap partition. Typically 4GB is enough (default on Macs, maybe you have 8?) You can later create a Swap file which acts like swap but is just a file on disk in Ubuntu. I'm adding an Answer with all the info in the comments, which I'll update as your problem progresses. Having no Swap removes some added complexity to everything.\n\nA: Your grub configuration is wrong, I actualy just fixed this on my macbook pro. In grub configureation, /boot/grub/grub.cfg, delete the menu entries for \"Mac OS X (64-bit) and (64-bit) but copy your uuid (where it says search --no-floppy --fs-uuid --set=root youruuidhere) and just put this:\nmenuentry \"Mac OS X (32-bit)\" --class osx --class darwin --class os {\n    insmod part_gpt\n    insmod hfsplus\n    set root='(hd0,gpt3)'\n    search --no-floppy --fs-uuid --set=root youruuidhere\n        load_video\n    chainloader /usr/standalone/i386/boot.efi\n    boot        \n}\nmenuentry \"Mac OS X (64-bit)\" --class osx --class darwin --class os {\n    insmod part_gpt\n    insmod hfsplus\n    set root='(hd0,gpt3)'\n    search --no-floppy --fs-uuid --set=root youruuidhere\n        load_video\n    chainloader /System/Library/CoreServices/boot.efi\n    boot   \n}\n\nThis method just dumps the grub bootloader into the efi component of the mac operating system instead of trying to load the xnu kernel manually with the kernel extentions. Grubs way of booting mac has never worked for me so i just use apples way of booting.  Hope this works for you too.\nP.S. This method i probably not the best because grub constantly reconfigures itself, instead of editing /boot/grub/grub.cfg it might be better to edit a grub config file such as the one that produces these entries, /etc/grub.d/30_os-prober or change grubs custom.cfg to add these and disable os_prober\n", "Q: Backup Ubuntu (or any Linux) Software Configuration I'm sure for the Linux pros out there there is a really obvious way of doing this, but is there an easy way to backup an Ubuntu software configuration, essentially as a distribution?\nTo clarify, I just installed Ubuntu 12.10 on my laptop. I went through a ton of updates, installed a bunch of software, configured some settings, etc., and I would like to essentially \"store\" this configuration essentially giving me an image that I could use to restore the computer to the same point if I needed to. While I know I can just dump the contents of the disk, I wanted it to be a bit hardware agnostic so if I needed to I could install onto different hardware (perhaps replicating the setup on a different PC).\nI think what I am looking for is a way to take my current configuration and turn it into a custom distribution, but I'm not sure of an easy way to do this that will retain all my updates and configurations. I imagine there is probably an easy way though since this kind of replication seems like it'd be common in IT use.\nEdit: As additional clarification, the backup cannot require an internet connection to work (i.e. all the packages, updates, and configurations should be stored with the backup) and it should not be tied to a specific hardware configuration (so I don't think a direct disk image clone will work).\nAny ideas?\n\nA: In Linux, there are two kind of configuration files: system-wide and per-user.  The system-wide configuration files are stored in /etc, and usually (but not always) apply to system utilities, such as iptables.  The per-user configuration files reside in your home directory with names beginning with a dot, such as .bashrc, and hold specific configuration files for each user.  By default, these files are hidden from sight in most file browsers and from ls.  Press Ctrl-H to toggle hidden file viewing in Nautilus and use ls with the -a option.  To create a backup of the configuration files in /etc, simply run cp -r /etc destination, where destination is the folder that you wish to have a backup of /etc in.  To create a backup of the configuration files and folders in your home folder, just run sudo cp -r ~/.* destination, where destination is the folder that you wish to have a backup of all your dot-files (another name for files starting with a dot) in.\n", "Q: How to install arduino-1.0.3-linux32.tgz?

Is it possible to use chgrp or chown to change a file's group to one that I as the owner am not a part of? I own the file, but I am not part of the group that I want to change it to, so can it be done without using sudo?\n\nA: Unfortunately you need to be a member of that group to give that group permission as per this link:\nhttps://serverfault.com/questions/462174/using-chown-to-change-the-group-owner-of-a-directory-is-not-permitted-why\nsudo is your only option...\n\nA: Yes, you can.

I wonder if updating my system as suggested by the update manager consumes extra space? \nBecause even after installing all software I would like to use, I had about 10 GB free space. Now, without my knowledge, I have only 6GB free space. \nDo I need to keep clearing temp folder contents like we do in Windows? If I need to delete, how do I do so? Any suggestions?\n\nA: When you have done update , the cache files will stay remain here.you need to clear them.\nfrom Terminal with CTRL+ALT+T you can clean it with\nsudo apt-get autoremove\nsudo apt-get autoclean\n\nIf you love the GUI then there is a evergreen application named bleachbit\nyou can install it with sudo apt-get install bleachbit .\nyou can clear more space by clearing the old kernels which you can do it easily from the Synaptic package manager.\n\nThere remove the old kernels , not the current one. For better purpose stay with two old recent kernels and clear remaining all of them.That can give you more free space.\nHope that helps.\n\nA: There will be some ebb and flow of hard drive space through updates. There could be some unneeded packages and old kernel left behind. I would recommend a \nsudo apt-get autoremove\nThis will do some basic clean up.\n\nA: The update by it self will reduce your free space on the disk almost always, because it is adding new packages/code/information to your system. \nAlso, the update system save the progress of the download of an update so if this is interrupted, you can return it from there. \nTo remove this cache files you can use the apt-get command with the following options:\n\n\n*\n\n*clean to delete it\n\n*autoclean to do it automatically or \n\n*autoremove to remove unnecessary packages\n\n\nFor more information enter man apt-get or see the online man apt-get document\n\nA: If you want, you can run these three commands together,\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get -y dist-upgrade\nsudo apt-get autoremove\n\nThe first one resynchronizes the package index files from their sources. The second one \nin addition to performing the function of upgrade,            also intelligently handles changing dependencies with new versions        of packages. apt-get has a smart conflict resolution system, and           it will attempt to upgrade the most important packages at the           expense of less important ones if necessary. And finally, the third one removes packages that were automatically           installed to satisfy dependencies for other packages and are now no           longer needed.\nActually, I have put the three commands together under one alias. See below,\nalias updatedistupgrade='sudo apt-get update; sudo apt-get -y dist-upgrade; sudo apt-get autoremove'\n\nAll I do is to run updatedistupgrade from time to time. So, in my system, the unnecessary files are never there.\nPlease execute  \nman apt-get\n\nto get more information.\n\nA: I am using Ubuntu Tweak which has very useful Janitor submenu. It let's you check which installation packages/old kernels could be removed. Nice and easy, no need to remeber these command line verses. And some of those packages really eat up disk space...\nThere are probably more applications that do the same.\n", "Q: How do I access \"Applications\"? Okay, I'll just go ahead and be stupid.

In older versions of Ubuntu, such as 12.04 like you're using, there is simply a drop-down menu.\n\n*Click on which application you want to launch (in this case, Brasero). You may also type in what you're looking for, and the Dash will bring up relevant results.\n\n\n\n\nAs for Checksums in Brasero, you may disable the feature by naviagating to Edit -> Plugins, then un-checking the File Checksum option.\n\n\nA: That article has written in 2010 and based on Ubuntu Old versions which are with Classic look.

(Why do I only have one workspace?) It appears that Unity on Raring only comes with a single virtual desktop (aka workspaces) by default, and CCSM's Wall plugin has no way to add more. Is this configurable at all?\n\nA: Using the Dash or a terminal, open the dconf-editor application. Navigate to\norg.compiz.profiles.unity.plugins.core\n\nAnd set the horizontal and vertical dimensions of your wall. A workspace switcher will immediately appear on the launcher. You can use this or Super-s to view the virtual desktops / workspaces.\nEdit\nTo set this using command-line, execute the command:\ngsettings set org.compiz.core:/org/compiz/profiles/unity/plugins/core/ hsize 2\ngsettings set org.compiz.core:/org/compiz/profiles/unity/plugins/core/ vsize 2\n\nThis will immediately enable workspaces. This command will actually set hsize to 2 and vsize to 2, giving you 4 workspaces arranged in a square, which is the default when you enable workspaces from the GUI \"Appearance\" setting.\n\nA: for 13.04 and later..\nWorkspaces are disabled by default in Ubuntu since 13.04. To enable them, open Appearance from the dash:  \n\nSwitch to the behaviour tab and check \"Enable Workspaces\".  \n \nIf you want to hide the workspace switcher see this question.\n\nA: Ubuntu 13.04 Raring Ringtail will come with workspaces disabled by default, so before being able to switch between them go to \"System Settings...\" > \"Appearance\" and switch to \"Behavior\" tab, then it is just to check \"Enable Workspaces\" option and you will have back your 4 workspaces.\nCtrl+Alt+Arrow will change current workspace and Shift+Ctrl+Alt+Arrow will change the current focused window to the desired workspace.\nYou can see a list of all the shortcuts of Ubuntu from \"System Settings...\" > \"Keyboard\" then switch to \"Keyboard Shortcuts\" tab and then you will be able, beyond to see all of them, to change them and create new shortcuts.\n\nA: Certainly,\nfirst, open ccsm. If it's not installed, run: sudo apt-get install compizconfig-settings-manager\nNext, you will find the setting in the General Options section, under the Desktop Size tab.\nHere you will see options for your Horizontal Virtual Size and Vertical Virtual Size.\nIncrease the Horizontal Virtual Size to a value >1. \nUse CTRL + ALT + right arrow to move one virtual desktop to the right and CTRL + ALT + left arrow to move one desktop to the left.\n\nA: This may be new since Alaa answered, but there is also a graphical way of adjusting the number of workspaces when you have compiz installed.\nOpen CompizConfig Settings Manager (installs from the Ubuntu Software Centre if not already installed), then under \"General\", click \"General Options\" and go to the \"Desktop Size\" tab.  This will automatically enable workspaces and gives you the ability to adjust it as you like.  I personally like 4 horizontal, 1 vertical.  It's really cool with desktop cube enabled.\n\nA: You can also install the Unity Tweak Tool, using it you can customize many aspects of the unity interface, including the number of workspaces. You can install it using the following repository:\nsudo apt-get install unity-tweak-tool\n\nThen you just open the Unity Tweak Tool, go to Window Manager/Workspace Settings and so you can choose as many workspaces as you wish.

I hope this helps you.\n\nA: It's not entirely clear what you think you've done up to this point, but I do see one glaring error in the partition table: /dev/sda5 is marked as an EFI System Partition (ESP), but it uses NTFS and is probably your Windows boot partition. This probably happened because you mistakenly set the \"boot flag\" on the disk using parted, GParted, or some other libparted-based tool. You should not set this \"flag\" using libparted-based tools on GPT disks except on the ESP! I don't know for a fact that Windows would flake out if you attempted to boot it from such a mis-marked partition, but it probably would. Thus, my recommendation is to use parted, GParted, gdisk, or some similar tool to fix the problem. First, boot a Linux emergency disc. Then, you can do either of two things (both would be redundant):\n\n\n*\n\n*Using parted, GParted, or another libparted-based tool, remove the \"boot flag\" from /dev/sda5. For instance, you might type set 5 boot off in parted.\n\n*Using gdisk, type t to change the type code, type 5 for the partition number, type 0700 as the type code, and then type w back at the prompt to save your changes. You could use cgdisk instead, if you prefer.\n\n\nEither of these actions will fix that glaring problem. I don't guarantee that the computer will then become bootable, but I suspect it will.\n", "Q: How do I recover files from an Ubuntu partition for which I am not the \"owner\"?

When I tried to use:\nsudo install-grub\n\nthe system gives me a message saying if I'm sure if /dev is installed.\nBurn a boot-repair USB and run it, but it says that I need internet access to complete the operation and repair grub2, and as I do not have a LAN connection I can´t do it either.\nI also tried reinstalling and updating Ubuntu, downloading another iso just in case, but with similar results.\nAny advice will be highly appreciated.\nI have extracted the boot-repair info file, in case it helps for this issue.\n\nA: Thanks to everyone!\nI finally sorted it, after understanding a few things and doing:\nInstalling 11.10\nCreating a Live-USB\nrunning Live USB\ninstalling and running boot-repair with:\nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:yannubuntu/boot-repair\n\nsudo apt-get install boot-repair\n\n sudo apt-get update\n\n\n\n*\n\n*GRUB came out here\n\n\nselecting Ubuntu Classic/2D in login screen \n\n\n*\n\n*Here I was able to click on things after \n\n\nbooting Ubuntu from my HDD\nUpdating\nRestarting and selecting normal mode\n\nA: If the boot menu did not come up, at boot keep on tapping the left-shift key. If grub2 comes up, then boot into Ubuntu.\nNow grub has detected Ubuntu, but as soon as you reboot it will not find Ubuntu.\nTo fix this, load Terminal in Ubuntu and type in update -grub.\nHopefully when you reboot grub should be there.\nHope this helps! \n\nA: Probably the problem is that grub2 insatlled in the usb... (Happened to me)\nWhat you need is burn another Ubuntu x64 usb, and do not create it woth unetbooton, use better the one that Ubuntu.com/download recomenss you... ( there is a faq that says how to make a bootable usb) \nNext boot from it and try Ubuntu, open a terminal and install boot-repair\n\nsudo apt-add-repository ppa:yannubuntu/boot-repair && sudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get install boot-repair && boot-repair\n\nThen go for recommended repair, Boot-repair will ask you to open a new terminal and write some commands down... It will repair grub...\nGood luck and don't make your computer explode! :D\n", "Q: Ubuntu Installer didn't ask which drive to install to I tried installing Ubuntu 12.10 to my Windows desktop for a dual boot system. I used YUMI so I could install it from a flash drive. My problem is that the installer never asked which drive I wanted to install to. After asking about my language, time zone, and keyboard, it just started copying files. I freaked out when I heard it thrashing my hard drive - I thought it was overwriting my copy of Windows, so I forced my computer to shut down while it was working.\nAfter rebooting back into Windows, I see that it deleted everything on my D drive (storage and backup drive) and was apparently installing Ubuntu onto it. I lost a lot of stuff because the installer never asked where I wanted to install Ubuntu (I have multiple hard drives and partitions).\nHow can I get the installer to check with me before deciding for itself where it's going to install?\n\nA: You can choose where to install Ubuntu and specify partitions manually by choosing Something else in the Installation type screen.\n\n", "Q: Program for managing \"Profiles\" (Home, work...) I'm looking for a program that manage profiles for System settings like Network, Displays, Mouse, Power etc. For example: One profile for work to enable new Proxy Settings, setting Brightness and turn Bluetooth on. Another Profile for home, to enable Wireless, disabling the Proxy settings and so on.\nAny ideas?\n\nA: \nUser and group account administration \n\nthis is what I found in the Softwarecenter, maybe this works out for your needs. \nmind you: I have never tested or used this, so I can't give advise on how to use or run it. \n\nA: I'm not sure if this is the best or only way to do this but one option would be to create multiple users.  Say 'User' and 'User-home'.\nEach user has his/her own home directory and so can be configured as you wish by making changes to ~/.profile or ~/.bashrc for example.\nThe problem here is that you probably have data you want to share between both users so in the home Directory of user create a subdirectory called 'Data' and in the home directory and  a symbolic link to it in the home directory of 'User-home'.\nln -s /home/User/Data /home/User-home/Data\nYou will also probably want to change the primary group of 'User-home' to match that of 'User' with sudo usermod -g User User-home\nIn this way you have two users who can access each others files with different settings.  For each user any file in ~/Data is the same file.  \n", "Q: What apps to remove from startup to make ubuntu boot faster? I have two BIG problems with my laptop, that one of them I want to ask here and it is about boot time latency. my laptop boots really slowly. Witch app is necessary to remain and witch one can be removed from startup using BUM?\n\nA: A lot of the startup apps are now hidden. \nOpen a terminal and type: \nsudo sed -i \"s/NoDisplay=true/NoDisplay=false/g\" /etc/xdg/autostart/*.desktop\nOpen startup applications: \nNOTE: Don't uncheck/disable what you don't know.\n\nA: Seeing the bootchart questions:\n\n\n*\n\n*kthread and similar stuff is not KDE but kernel related and unavoidable.\n\n*ureadahead is supposed to speed up application start on the cost of a longer boot time.\n\n*upstart-udev-br bridges udev events into upstart and is required for hot plugging.\n\n*upstart-socket, dbus and polkit are desktop comfort and security related.\n\n*modem-manager to dhclient depend on network speed.\n\n\nGeneral recommendations:\n\n\n*\n\n*Don't mount NTFS volumes during startup; add noauto to partitions that you use rarely.\n\n*If you don't use WLAN or bluetooth, activate the killswitch or disable it by network-manager.\n\n*Remove unused printer drivers; If you rarely ever print, disable the cups service.\n\n*Gnome / Unity can be somewhat hefty on older laptops. Explore alternative desktops like xfce or lxde.\n\n*Consider buying an SSD. That really speeds things up.\n\n", "Q: How do I build a Hyper-V enabled kernel in a Ubuntu 12.10 guest VM on Server 2012? I have installed Ubuntu 12.10 x64 as guest VM on Server 2012, and want to upgrade kernel to Linux 3.8, as the 3.8 kernel supports the balloon driver for dynamic memory and new IC (I assume).\nBefore upgrading, the mouse working was working; after upgrading to a generic 3.8 kernel the mouse doesn't work and no hv_timesource, hv_ballon driver is present.\nI've tried to install the kernel from source enabling all hyper-v components with no luck.

I have setup openldap and samba a while ago, this problem existed since then and I still don't know how to fix it. I use webmin's LDAP client to create a \"testuser\" account, and get following error:\nfailed to save user : /usr/bin/pdbedit failed :\npdb_set_user_sid_from_string: -21020 isn't a valid SID!\ninit_sam_from_ldap: no sambaSID or sambaSID attribute found for this user atest\nldapsam_getsampwnam: init_sam_from_ldap failed for user 'testuser'!\nldapsam_add_sam_account: User 'testuser' already in the base, with samba attributes \n\nI think SAMBA and OpenLDAP integration is not working corectly. Even with above error, \"testuser\" account is created. I can login with this account via SSH, but I can't login to Samba server on the same server. The last line of the error indicates some configuration is overlapped, but I don't know where and how to fix it. \nUpdate:\nHere is SAMBA setting section in LDAP users and groups configuration page of Webmin:\n\nAnd \nSamba version 3.4.7\nLDAP protocol version 3\nUpdate 2:\nThe error disappeared after I copied and pasted the sambaID for the samba server from \"LDAP client -> LDAP Browser\". So the input for \"Domain SID for Samba3\" looks something like:     \nS-1-5-22-3845707085-2256048510-3517135715.  \nNow samba user is created, but I still can't login to the samba server. The problem now is with password sync. \n\nA: I tried following command to add a testuser account with group ID of 10000:\nsudo smbldap-useradd -a -P testuser\n\ngot error:\nCan't call method \"get_value\" on an undefined value at /usr/sbin/smbldap-useradd line 231, <DATA> line 466.\n\nLooking at the script /usr/sbin/smbldap-useradd I found that I have to specify a group ID for this new user. So next command: \nsudo smbldap-useradd -a -P -g 10000 testuser\n\nWhere 10000 is the group id of intended LDAP group. I got this error:\nError: SID not set for unix group 10000\ncheck if your unix group is mapped to an NT group\n\nI went a head and sync the usergroup by going to \"Samba Windows File Sharing\" module of webmin, and added a samba group which also connected to the Unix/LDAP group that has id of 10000.

It has a ATI Radeon Mobility X1600 256MB and I would grateful if you could tell me how to install the graphic card drivers.\nSo far the Ubuntu runs fine.\nThank you in advance\n\nA: The Unofficial AMD Linux Driver Wiki says:\n\nATI Radeon 9500-9800, Xpress200-1250, 690G, 740G, X300-X2500, Mobility RadeonHD 2300 If your card is on that list, you are limited to open-source drivers on Ubuntu Lucid/10.04 (and later). If you really need the proprietary Catalyst/fglrx driver, you will have to use an older Linux distribution, such as Debian Lenny/5.0.x or Ubuntu Hardy/8.04.x. NOTE: If you enter your card information on AMD/ATI's driver page, it will offer you the Catalyst 9-3 driver to download. However, the Catalyst 9-3 driver doesn't support X servers past 1.5, and it will not work with Precise (or anything later than Lucid/10,04)! !!!SO BE CAREFUL!!! If you tried to install Catalyst on a system with one of these cards, see the 'Removing the Driver' section to restore the default/pre-installed drivers.\n\nThis maybe include the ATI Radeon Mobility X1600 graphic card. It means that your card isn't supported anymore by the proprietary Fglrx driver. But you card is supported by the open source Radeon driver:\n\nRV530/RV560                 Radeon X1600/X1650/X1700\n\nso your card should work.\nIf the output from this command: lspci -nnk | grep -i vga -A3 | grep 'in use' is: Kernel driver in use: radeon, your Radeon graphic driver is loaded.\nSee:\n\n\n*\n\n*Which features the Radeon driver provides for your card.

I'm a bit stuck here, and I'm new to Ubuntu so please forgive me if this is a stupid question :D.\nLately, I tried to save 60GB of Music to my home folder's music folder in Ubuntu but it said there would only be 10GB free space out of 20GB. But I installed Ubuntu to a partition of 270GB of which 240GB are still free. Apart from that, I have a D partition with 100GB and a C partition, with Windows on it, of 70GB and no other partition. When I looked in terminal, it said, there would also be something like a partition (but I don't know if it is) called loop, of 29GB.

In this case, that was selected, and a 30GB file was created, in which everything Ubuntu uses, goes into. This file is not dynamic, as it will only hold up to 30GB, and it would be 30GB, even if you have only written 4GB to it. The best solution is to install Ubuntu from the live CD on its own partition with the amount of space you need.\nIf you want to still use Wubi, you can use /host to access your Windows C:\\ drive from within Ubutu. If you configure your music downloader  to stick music there, or create a symlink with:\nln -s /host/Users/[yourWindowsUsername]/Music ~/WindowsMusic\n\nand you can put your music into WindowsMusic in your home folder.\n\nA: May be you have to check your partitions again, to make sure that you have installed Ubuntu in correct partition. You can do this by sudo parted -l\n", "Q: How can I use the default theme from 12.10 in 12.04? I really like the changes that was made to the default theme in 12.10.

If so, please give step-by-step instructions.\nThanks!\n\nA: How to move /home to its own partition\nWhen you want to move your /home directory to another partition (because your HDD is full), here is a Step-By-Step guide how to do it.\nNote: You want to print this page or write it down because you need the commands during the moving of your /home directory! You can't access your browser during this process.\n0. If it isn't already, format your HDD as ext4.\n1. Determine the size of your home directory by opening a Terminal (CTRL + ALT + T) and entering:\ndu -sh /home\n\nThe result should be something like\n34G /home\n\n2. Enter a text console by hitting (CTRL + ALT + F1) and get temporary root permissions:\nsudo -s\ncd /\n\n3. Mount the destination partition (the external HDD)\nEnter fdisk -l into the Terminal to get a list of all partitions. Remember the name of the external HDD. Then execute\nmkdir /mnt/tmp\nmount /dev/sdXY /mnt/tmp \n\nand replace /dev/sdXY with the name of your external HDD (e.g. /dev/sda5).\nThis mounts your external HDD.\n4. Copy the data from /home/ to the external HDD.\nThis can be done with:\nrsync -avx --progress /home/ /mnt/tmp \n\n5. Test your /home partition:\nExecute these commands\nmount /dev/sdXY /home \n\nwhere /dev/sdXY is your external HDD. Now you can test your new /home partition:\ndu -sh /home; mount|grep /home \n\nThe output should be something like\n34G    /home\n/dev/sda5 on /home type ext4 (rw)\n\n6. Delete your home partition\nNow you need to delete the existing home partition. To do this, unmount the home partition and remove it:\numount /home\nrm -rf /home/* \n\n7. Enter the new UUID into /etc/fstab\nThe last step is to enter the UUID of the external HDD into /etc/fstab. This step is very important!\nSwitch back to your desktop by hitting the keys CTRL + ALT + F7 (or F6, don't know which one is the right one).\nOpen a Terminal and enter sudo blkid in the Terminal and search for the entry of your external HDD. My entry would be:\n/dev/sda5: LABEL=\"Ubuntu\" UUID=\"bb288354-34a8-4716-9740-96aa9da99dac\" TYPE=\"ext4\"\n\nNow open /etc/fstab with a text editor (i.e. gedit):\ngksudo gedit /etc/fstab\n\nand add the following entry at the end of the file:\n# /dev/sdXY \nUUID=YOUR-UUID-HERE  /home   ext4   defaults   0 2\n\nBut don't forget to replace YOUR-UUID-HERE with the UUID of the external HDD and /dev/sdXY with the name of your HDD (for example: /dev/sda5).\n8.

This involves the main hardware of the PC.    \n\nA: Generally Ubuntu will detect hardware at boot time. This means that any hardware changes we had made between boots will be taken care of from the next boot.\nFrom my own experience this will work fine even when we changed a sensible piece of hardware like a graphic card. In the usual case we just plug in the new hardware, boot and may have to install proprietary drivers only in case we feel we need them for better performance.\nHowever in some cases there may be issues from a propretiary driver we may had installed for the previous card. Also we may need to purge an altered X.org configuration if this was done from the previous graphic card's settings. This can all be done from booting a root shell in case the graphic system was badly tampered.\nThere is no need to reinstall Ubuntu.\nTo avoid sitting on a Ubuntu booting to command line only we may want to consider removing all proprietary drivers before we change our graphic card.\n", "Q: How to install WINE on Wubi?

I've googled for it, and there's very little info besides \"bamf matches application windows to desktop files\". \nUnity depends on it so it's difficut to remove, at least would be good to know what it does.\n\nA: When you open a program, Unity will either pop up a new icon on the launcher(dock) and/or add an arrow to an existing icon. Each icon is not an executable; it is a .desktop file. bamfdaemon helps this by determining whether an arrow needs to be added to an existing icon, or a new icon be popped up, along with other behaviors dependent on application identity.\n\nA: I think it is related to Unity Integration for websites.

(Translated from German:)\nHow can we get videos out of a Sony HDR CR160 camcorder attached to an USB port? How do I convert them to a more generally available format?\nThere is only software for Windows or MacOS available from the manufacturer.\n\nA: Any USB storage device (e.g. any camcorder, camera etc.) can simply be plugged in to an USB port and mounted as removable storage device. No additional drivers are needed to do so. We can browse the files on our camcorder with the default file manager Nautilus and simply copy & paste or drag & drop them to the desired location on our hard drive.\nProvided we had installed ubuntu-restricted-extras , and libavcodec-extra-53  we should be able to view most the file formats from camcorders in our video player (default will be Totem movie player).\nTo convert to another format we do have quite some applications for the desktop, or the command line to help you.

After a lot of messing around I found mini-dlna which works well, the problem is, everyone on my network can see my shares and I don't want this.  Does anyone have a way of securing it?  I thought maybe using iptables but I don't have any experience with it and I don't want to setup a whole load of firewall exceptions for everything that I have running on the PC such as ssh and web servers etc, I'd want to just restrict DLNA access.

I can get clients in Android streaming fine, it's just the security issue, I can't find a working client in Linux though, VLC doesn't work, it sees my server but clicking it, double clicking it, adding to playlist doesn't do anything.\n\nA: For the first part of your question, you might want to take a look at Serviio.

Maybe too much work around-code-there also.\nSo what is the canonical (schenkelklopf ) way of stacking Tabs and some full screen Page?\nI guess it's just not quite ready yet etc. and inconsistencies are a temporal state right now arising from the development rush of Ubuntu?\nAs an example I made up this code:\nimport QtQuick 2.0\nimport Ubuntu.Components 0.1\n\nMainView {\n    width: units.gu(40)\n    height: units.gu(71)\n    PageStack {\n        id: pageStack\n        anchors.fill: parent\n        Component.onCompleted: push(auberginePage)\n        Tabs {\n            id: auberginePage\n            anchors.fill: parent\n            Tab {\n                title: \"Awesome?\"\n                page: Rectangle {\n                    anchors.fill: parent;\n                    visible: false\n                    color: \"#2C001E\"\n                    MouseArea {\n                        anchors.fill: parent;\n                        onClicked: pageStack.push(orangePage)\n                    }\n                }\n            }\n        }\n        Rectangle {\n            id: orangePage\n            color: \"#DD4814\"\n            visible: false\n            anchors.fill: parent\n        }\n    }\n}\n\n\nA: Simply set the title of the page that you want to be in fullscreen mode to an empty string, like this:\nPage {\n    title: \"\"\n}\n\nEasy as that!\n\nA: I overlooked the __showHeader property and found it while reading other core apps.\npageStack.__showHeader = false\n\nHack not needed.\n", "Q: gcc or cc no longer seems to work in 12.04 lts I recently installed 12.04 LTS and I would like to compile short c programs.\nWhen I enter gcc or cc at the command promp to compile a simple test program \"test.c\"I get the following:\ntest.c: In function ‘main’:\ntest.c:6:1: error: stray ‘\\342’ in program\ntest.c:6:1: error: stray ‘\\200’ in program\ntest.c:6:1: error: stray ‘\\234’ in program\ntest.c:6:1: error: stray ‘\\342’ in program\ntest.c:6:1: error: stray ‘\\200’ in program\ntest.c:6:1: error: stray ‘\\235’ in program\ntest.c:6:11: error: ‘Test’ undeclared (first use in this function)\ntest.c:6:11: note: each undeclared identifier is reported only once for each function it appears in\n\nDo I need to install other software (other than gcc?\nsincerely,\nBruce\n\nA: You should look at line 6 of your code, and re-type it. It would solve the problem.\nHere is an excerpt from http://www.giannistsakiris.com:\n\nThe errors were of this form:  giannis@giannis-vbox:~$ gcc\nprogram.c program.c: In function ‘main’: program.c:57: error: stray\n‘\\342’ in program program.c:57: error: stray ‘\\200’ in program\nprogram.c:57: error: stray ‘\\234’ in program program.c:57: error:\nstray ‘\\’ in program \nI couldn't see any obvious syntactical error in the mentioned line.\n  This is how line #57 looks like:\nprintf(“\\nThe linked list representation is...\\n”);\n\nAt first sight, it looks pretty fine, but if you look closely you will\n  see that the double quotation marks that surround the string literal\n  are not the neutral (vertical) ones (like this: \"). They are left and\n  right double quotation marks respectively.\nIf I replace the quotation marks with the neutral ones, like this:\nprintf(\"\\nThe linked list representation is...\\n\");\n\nthe problem is solved. So, if you are getting this kind of error maybe\n  you should look closely to any double (or single) quotation marks in\n  the erroneous line.\n\n\nA: That looks like a problem with your code. Not gcc, from what I can tell it's working properly.\nSomething like the wrong characters? Make sure you're using ' and not ´ etc.\n", "Q: How drop an audio stream using avconv? How do I Drop audio from a MKV with DTS encoding? I am using this command avconv -i Movie.mkv -c:v copy movie.mp4.\nI know the command would include the codec command but I don't know how to use it.\n\nA: To my understanding the -an parameter will simply drop audio from the output. If thats not what you wanted, then you need to use the -map command and specify how individual streams from different sources should be mapped to the output. The following example takes only the first stream from the first file (usually video) and audio from the second file.\navconv -i input0.mkv -i input1.m4a -map 0:0 -c:v copy -map 1 -c:a copy output.mp4\n\n\nA: Looks like the option -an should do the trick.

Just looked this up. Figure I'd share it here for future reference.\n\nA: To remove then change a single field we can use this command:\nexiftool -Copyright= IMG_3357.jpg\nexiftool -Copyright=LinuxSlaves IMG_3357.jpg\n\nReference\n\nA: I wish to add mat2 which support not only images. It's recommended by privacyguides.org (formerly known as privacytools.io) community.\n\nMAT2 is free software, which allows the removal of metadata of image,\naudio, torrent, and document file types. It provides both a command\nline tool and a graphical user interface via an extension for\nNautilus, the default file manager of GNOME.\n\nand\n\nmat2 is a metadata removal tool, supporting a wide range of commonly\nused file formats, written in python3: at its core, it's a library,\nused by an eponymous command-line interface, as well as several file\nmanager extensions.\n\nsudo apt install mat2\n\nin-place purge of metadata\nmat2 -s  xxx.mp4\nmat2 -s  xxx.png\n\n\nA: Imagemagick\nInstead of Exiftool, to handle Exif metadata (IPTC, XMP and ICC image metadata also) I found Imagemagick more useful and command easier to remember.\nSince IMv7 magick identify/mogrify/... it's used instead [1].\nTo read\nidentify -verbose image.jpg | grep exif\n\nTo remove\nWith imagemagick package installed you can do this (not only for JPEGs):\nmogrify -strip *.jpg  # Optionally: -verbose\n\nFrom manual:\n\n-strip strip the image of any profiles, comments or these PNG chunks: bKGD, cHRM, EXIF, gAMA, iCCP, iTXt, sRGB, tEXt, zCCP, zTXt, date.\n\nSince you will lost the orientation metadata, maybe you'll want to mogrify -auto-orient image.jpg first.\nAFAIK the only difference with exiftool is that mogrify won't remove this metadata:\n\n*\n\n*JFIF Version\n\n*Resolution Unit\n\n*X Resolution\n\n*Y Resolution\n\nWhich might be useful. Compared with diff -y <(exiftool wMogrify.jpg) <(exiftool wExiftool.jpg)\nRemove EXIF data is not the same as anonymize: -strip will recompress the image. This might be a good thing: The same software that take the photo (or other) could hide sensitive information (which may be encrypted) inside of ordinary image data (steganography). I'm not sure if the recompression will always remove everything (probably not). To avoid this recompression you can use jpegtran:\njpegtran -copy none image.jpg > newimage.jpg\n\nAlso, to avoid losing color profile (ICC metadata, which causes richer colors[citation needed]):\nconvert image.jpg profile.icm && convert image.jpg -strip -profile profile.icm newimage.jpg\n\nYou might ask yourself if these costs are noticeable or relevant in your case.\nAnother tool about steganography on images is steghide.\nOther tools and notes\n\n*\n\n*mat2 (Metadata anonymization toolkit v2): Removes metadata from a lot of formats (--list). It's recommended by privacyguides.org.\n\n*Alternatives: jhead (only for JPEGs) and exiv2 (man; suggested on Wikipedia).\n\n*Metadata Cleaner: Desktop app to view and clean metadata in files (not only images).\n\n*If you prefer Exiftool, you might find useful creating an alias to exiftool -all= *.jpg && rm *original, or with -overwrite_original option. To remove only GPS data use exiftool -gps:all= -xmp:geotag= *.jpg. Use an updated version: CVE-2021-22204.\n\n*WebP format: webp package provides webpmux command, which manage XMP/EXIF metadata and ICC profile.\n\nSee also\n\n*\n\n*Harry Potter and the Digital Fingerprints | Electronic Frontier Foundation\n\n*A Picture is Worth a Thousand Words, Including Your Location | Electronic Frontier Foundation\n\n*#facebook is embedding tracking data inside photos you download\n\nA: There are a number of tools for this, as others have listed.

"Q: Trying to install Steam ERROR: You are missing the following 32-bit libraries, and Steam may not run: not I've already installed Steam, but when I click on the program I get this message\nERROR- You are missing the following 32-bit libraries, and Steam may not run:\nnot\n\nI don't know what to install or even do.\n\nA: You are propably running an 64bit version of Ubuntu.\nJust open the terminal and type:\nsudo apt-get install ia32-libs\n\nThis way you'll have full compatibility with 32bit applcations, such as Steam, skype and others.\n\nA: This seem to happen on every 64 bits OS.\nFull bug report here: https://github.com/ValveSoftware/steam-for-linux/issues/321\nSolution:\ngksudo gedit /etc/ld.so.conf.d/steam.conf\n\nAdd next two lines to file:\n/usr/lib32\n/usr/lib/i386-linux-gnu/mesa\n\nThen execute:\nsudo ldconfig\n\nNow you should be able to run Steam\n\nsolution found here: http://steamcommunity.com/app/221410/discussions/0/864959336441792994/?l=russian\n\nA: Here's what I had to do on Intel Sandy Bridge (HD3000 graphics)- for Nvidia/AMD use appropriate source:\nsudo ln -s /usr/lib/i386-linux-gnu/mesa/libGL.so.1 /usr/lib\n\nSteam and 3D in vmWare works now.\n\nA: I'm running 14.04 LTS (with elementary OS 0.3.2 Freya 64bit), and this worked perfectly for me:\nsudo dpkg --add-architecture i386\nsudo add-apt-repository multiverse\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get install steam\n\nAlso, to note, this was actually a solution for a different (but related) problem.\n\nA: No problem. Welcome to Linux and Ubuntu, by the way.\nFirst, if you didn't install Steam from the Ubuntu Software Center, and didn't try, see if you can install it that way, removing Steam from your system beforehand. You may need to run sudo apt-get update in a terminal beforehand (when it prompts you for your password, it's typing even if nothing shows up onscreen). I've also noticed that Steam only shows up in the Software Center when you click \"show technical items\" at the bottom.\nIf that doesn't help, see the Known Issues section on the Valve Developer wiki. Follow the instructions for Debian-based distributions: \nsudo apt-get install lib32stdc++6\n\nLet me know if these instructions don't make sense.\n\nA: How to run Steam with ATI 13.04 on Ubuntu 13.04 64bit with kernel 3.8.12:\n\n\n*\n\n*open terminal\n\n*Create startup file in your home directory:\nsudo gedit st3am.sh\n\n\n*put this in file:\nLD_PRELOAD=/usr/lib32/fglrx/libGL.so.1 steam\n\n\n*Save & make executable:\nchmod a+x st3am.sh\n\n\n*Make shortcut and move to desktop or add to your application menu\n\n*Have a fun :)\n\nA: I had a similar problem with nVidia and Steam, using a GeForce 650ti with the 331 drivers. \nI ended up doing CTRL-ALT-F1 and logging in, then \nsudo service lightdm stop, \ntelinit 3 (perhaps not needed after the service stop), and sudo sh NVIDIA*.run. \nThe original 331 drivers were removed, and the installation (this time) went fine, and Steam works.\n\nA: I simply ran using optirun. From a terminal window: optirun steam. Sets steam running on my actual graphics card rather than cpu-onboard intel graphics.\n", "Q: Ubuntu 12.10 No Wifi after updates My Wifi disappeared after 80 software updates package from Ubuntu. Im new to Ubuntu. Im using Acer Aspire 5742. The Wifi was there after the installation of Ubuntu but after I did the updates my Wifi no longer works. \n\nA: I had a similar problem, however I was able to solve it.  I cannot exactly remember how, but try using the code rfkill list all in the terminal.  I remember using that code, but I do not remember if I used any follow-up codes.  Hopefully that works, but if not the results you get from that might be able to help other, more experienced, ubuntu users to help solve your problem.\n", "Q: How to get a clock in Unity top panel? I installed Ubuntu 12.10, 64-bit, I had a clock up in the top right of the top menu panel. \nI noticed the other day that it is no longer there.  I've scoured all the settings and everything in Ubuntu Tweak, but I can't find any way to get it back. \nHow do I get my clock back on Unity top panel?\n\n\nA: First, try checking it's installed with sudo apt-get install indicator-datetime.\nAlso, check the setting's checked at System Settings->Time & Date->Clock:  \n\n", "Q: Which file containts ALL_PROXY variable? I wonder which file contains ALL_PROXY variable which is being set by Network Manager so I could update it manually.\n\nA: All the proxy variables are stored in /etc/environment file, if you've set the proxy using Network Manager.\nIf you do not find it there, it can be in either of the following files:\n\n\n*\n\n*~/.bashrc\n\n*/etc/bash.bashrc\n\n*/etc/bashrc\n\n*/etc/profile\n\n*~/.bash_profile\n\n*~/.bash_login\n\n*~/.profile\n", "Q: \"b43.blacklist\", successful boot - what next for working wireless? a definite newbie to Ubuntu and despite lots of ignorance, I've understood just enough to have got 12.04 installed and looking good on my old Acer Aspire 3003Wlmi. However, after days of not being able to boot from the hard drive, only via the live USB stick that was used for the install, it seems that it is the wireless card/driver/thingy that makes it hang.\nI found and followed Eliah's solution to get past the hangs and into the desktop. However, as I understand it, this leaves me with no working wireless connection.\nWhat should I do from here to restore the wireless service, but still be able to log in and use the computer? I've previously installed 12.10 which worked well, wireless network included, but with an awful display resolution, so I assume there is a solution for the earlier OS?\nThanks in advance\n\nA: Thanks for the answers - it seems that the need to blacklist b43 was temporary, just to allow the OS to install without hanging.\nFollowing the instructions here carefully (my card is the BCM4318), it let me in to install/reinstall b43, restart and boot from the hard drive without a problem. Success!\n\nA: Since you've blacklisted b43 you need a different wireless driver in its stead.\nYou can see if Ubuntu can find the proprietary Broadcom driver by going to System Settings->Additional Drivers. The one it should find is \"Broadcom STA Proprietary Wireless Driver\", aka Broadcom wl.\n\nA: I have this same wlan card in my ancient Dell laptop running Debian stable . I fixed it by following the instructions at wiki.debian.org/wl . Broadcom also a Linux driver page found here http://www.broadcom.com/support/802.11/linux_sta.php\n", "Q: Command-line way to view information about a PPA? Lets imagine I have a added a repository called ppa:something/amazing, but I have forgotten what the PPA was all about and the name of the PPA is too vague or the PPA is a very large one. I want to check what it is without using an internet browser and going to the Launchpad website. Is there a way to view information about the PPA from the command line? I am mainly interested viewing a list of the packages contained in the PPA.\n\nA: Assuming you have the package list downloaded (apt-get update will do that) you could see there what packages are available for your distribution from that PPA.\nIf you want some shell code this should do the trick:\nPPA=ppa:something/amazing\nless $(echo \"$PPA\"|sed -e 's!/!_!' -e 's!^ppa:!/var/lib/apt/lists/ppa.launchpad.net_!' -e 's!$!_ubuntu_dists_'$(lsb_release -sc)'_main_binary-'$(dpkg --print-architecture)'_Packages!')\n\n\nA: Here is a shell script based on this answer:\n#!/bin/bash\n\nif [ $# -eq 1 ]; then\n    CMD=s\n    PPA=$1  \nelse\n    CMD=$1\n    PPA=$2\nfi\n\ncase \"$CMD\" in\n\"-f\" | \"f\")\n    cat $(echo \"$PPA\"|sed -e 's!/!_!' -e 's!^ppa:!/var/lib/apt/lists/ppa.launchpad.net_!' -e 's!$!_ubuntu_dists_'$(lsb_release -sc)'_main_binary-'$(dpkg --print-architecture)'_Packages!') | less\n    ;;\n\"-s\" | \"s\")\n    cat $(echo \"$PPA\"|sed -e 's!/!_!' -e 's!^ppa:!/var/lib/apt/lists/ppa.launchpad.net_!' -e 's!$!_ubuntu_dists_'$(lsb_release -sc)'_main_binary-'$(dpkg --print-architecture)'_Packages!') | grep 'Package:' | sed 's/Package: //'\n    ;;\n*)\n    echo \"Usage: $0 [mode] PPA\"\n    echo \"\"\n    echo \"mode:\"\n    echo \"  -f:  Displays detailed information about each package in the PPA\"\n    echo \"  -s:  Displays only the names of the packages in the PPA\"\n    ;;\nesac\n\nSave this to a file, such as ppa-info, and make sure it is located within the system path and is executable.\nWhen you run this with just the name of a PPA (or the option -s), it will simply print a list of the names of all the packages in the PPA. However, if you run it with the option -f, it will print detailed information about all the packages in the PPA, just as in the original answer.\n", "Q: Update grayed out (Xorg X server -- QXL display driver) I've been ignoring this issue for a while since it didn't effect anything on my system.

I have recently begun to dual boot for the sake of work, so I installed Ubuntu 12.04 on my Dell Inspiron 1525.  It possesses a Broadcom BCM4312 Wireless card.  I have no troubles getting an ethernet connection to work, but my wireless is acting odd, to say the least.

I am absolutely positive that I am inserting the correct passphrase (WPA security setting), but it refuses to connect.  I have browsed and tried other responses to no avail, but I am completely new to Ubuntu and have no idea what some of the terminal commands are actually doing, so it could be user error.

This makes no sense as I've upgraded a clone of this machine in the past and it went straight to 10.04.  I can get out to the internet fine.  Any ideas why this might be?\n\nA: What I would probably do is just download a 10.04 ISO file and burn to a disk or usb. Then when you boot the computer from the disk, one of the installation options is to upgrade your current version to the version on the disk. It will keep all of your files and settings. I can't honestly say I've ever done it before, but I know it's an option.

When I turned on my computer this morning to load the file, I could not find it. I've searched for the file, and I've searched its content usinggrep, and I still have not found the file.\nWhen I open gedit, in the \"file\" drop-down menu it lists my most recent files, and the filename of the missing file is there, however, when I select it, there is no text, it is empty. It says it is located in /tmp but I cannot find the file when I browse or search the filesystem. Please help me\n\nA: According to the message in gedit you saved the file in the /tmp folder. Ubuntu as well as many other Linux distributions deletes all content in /tmp on every reboot. This is a recommendation from the Filesystem Hierarchy Standard.\nSad to say if you don't have another backup copy, your original is lost.\nIf you want to keep the files in /tmp longer, this answer describes how to set the value of TMPTIME.\n\nA: If you remember the \"exact\" filename(including character sensitivity), then do a locate file_name in console(eg. gnome-terminal).\nNote: 1) locate will not return the file location if the filename is \"File\" and you do a locate file, but fine if you do a locate ile, I hope you got me.\n2) gedit makes a copy of every file in the same location as it was saved with a ~ appended to the end of its filename. For eg. if you saved a file file, then a file~ named file should exist unless you have explicity set it not to in gedit. So, there is a chance you may find your file.\n\nA: Someone correct me if I am wrong but I believe the tmp folder gets emptied when you reboot so you should not expect to find it there. However, if by some luck it is there then you should go to the command line and hit \ncd /tmp\n\nthen \ngedit filename & \n\nto open. If the file was blank it is likely that the file was not there so you can check whether or not it exists in this folder by typing \nls -l\n\n\nA: It might be too late now, but you could always try to recover the file with PhotoRec. Given that /tmp/ has undergone a fair number of write/delete cycles by now it's unlikely that you'll be able to recover your file, but not completely impossible. \nPhotoRec is included in the testdisk package.\n", "Q: Ubuntu how can I send my audio output, to the mobile which is connected using bluetooth? My mobile running Android which is using bluetooth connected to my Ubuntu 12.10 64-bit. \n\nMy goal is to have following step:\n\n\n*\n\n*In my Ubuntu desktop I am running music from YouTube\n\n*Mobile phone is connected to Ubuntu Desktop using bluetooth\n\n*From my mobile I have a head phone connected to my ear \n\n*I want to hear the music from my mobile the same audio which is playing in desktop\n\n\nHow can I do that? in this popup dialog I don't have any kind of option to send audio output on bluetooth.\nFollow up:\n\n\nA: If you use Blueman instead of gnome bluetooth manager you can set uo your phone as sound output.\nYou can find Blueman in Software Center\n\nA: I also tried to do this in the past, searched for answers and the basic answer for this question is that you can't do it, because the android bluetooth stack lacks support for A2DP sink capabilities.\nThen I found a great answer at stackoverflow which says that it might be possible to do it, but it's hard to do. The answer and the details are here. For the solution presented in that answer you will need:\n\n\n*\n\n*a rooted device.\n\n*Good programming skills/experience. (Or someone who does it for you)\n\n*Android version older than 4.2, because in 4.2 Android switched from the BlueZ stack to Broadcom's Bluedroid.\n\n\nBut I don't know whether the solution presented in that answer really works, because I never tried it. Maybe in the future Google will change the default bluetooth stack to support the A2DP sink profile or some modders make a custom ROM with support for it, but until that day this is the only way.  \n\nA: You stated that using Wifi is okay, so here's an easy solution to your problem. Set up Icecast on you machine and set the audio source to something like stereo-mix (see the chapter on Darkice).\nOn your mobile device just install any player capable of playing streams (e.g. VLC for Android or Tunein Radio, both free and both available for Android and iOS) and point them to your stream.\nIf you desperately want to use Bluetooth there should be a way. You cannot simply use the Android device as a Bluetooth speaker. But you could create a virtual pulseaudio recording device that just records everything played (i.e. monitor soundcard) and use this as a bluetooth microphone. Now you need an app on your mobile device that plays out loud what is recorded on the microphone (like this). For the pluseaudio part you could ask for details on the IRC channel #pulseaudio on freenode.net.\n\nA: You could also save the Android output and connect your bluetooth headset to your ubuntu machine, just set it up as any other device but in \"Device Type\" just select headphone (or something like that) \n", "Q: Ubuntu Mobile programming language?

Installing ruby is easy enough using apt-get install ruby1.9.1.\nBut how can I set it as the default/system/global ruby in a automated fashion?\n\nA: Simply make sure that the ruby found in $PATH is (a link to) the right one.\nOn my Ubuntu 12.04 (if I disable rvm, which I'm normally using to manage rubies), \nwhich ruby\n\nshows /usr/bin/ruby and ls -l which ruby  reveals that it's a link to \n/etc/alternatives/ruby which is again a link, whose destination is intended to be managed by the update-alternatives command.\nSo I can either use update-alternatives to point it to the right version (probably the preferred way to do it), create the link manually, or make sure the $PATH variable ends up at a different link (perhaps one placed in  $HOME/bin ) that points to the right ruby. \n(Note: the actually binaries on my system are installed in /usr/bin and are distinguished by having their version in their name, e.g. /usr/bin/ruby1.9.3).\nAll of these instructions are bash commands (or references to bash commands) so automation should be just about putting those commands in a script. \n", "Q: Accessing Ubuntu Server from a Windows Machine?

I then also played music on Ubuntu just fine, yet when I rebooted into Windows, without doing anything else besides opening Chrome, my headphones stopped working.\nExact same problem as in this thread: headphones not working on Windows after installing Kubuntu 12.10, which was left with many doubts and no answer.\nLuckily I have not done anything on windows after installing Ubuntu 12.10, nor have I mingled with the audio driver. I fixed the problem using some advice from a discussion thread by rebooting into Linux and forcing the laptop to shutdown by holding the power button (in order to prevent Linux from muting the headphone jack in a way that Windows doesn't see). The headphones now work like before, thus it is obviously a problem originating from Linux.\nAlthough this trick works for now, and I assume that it will work as long as I never shutdown Linux properly, I would definitely like a proper solution to this.\nThe discussion thread where I was told to crash Linux: https://bbs.archlinux.org/viewtopic.php?id=146773\n\nA: I have had this problem also. You just have to shutdown from Ubuntu not restart.

When I don't mute sound in Ubuntu, the laptop speakers work in Windows, but no audio comes from headphones.\nThis answer may not apply to you if this temporary solution does not work.\nHope this helps.  \n\nA: I have had a similar issue, if I am getting you right.  To me it also happened after installing and using Ubuntu 12.04 for some time. Sound worked with laptop speakers, but not with headphones. I have tried several fixes that I don't remember now, but what helped was reinstalling drivers in Windows (8). As simple may this sound, this was the easiest fix and it worked in my case. Hope it helps.

Only the 32-bit version is officially supported. I had to get the .deb from steam's web site.\n\nA: Steam is no longer in the official Ubuntu repositories. \nUntil it reappears there, I would suggest installing Steam directly from Valve. If I remember, the .deb file that they provided will automatically add Valve repositories so that you can receive updates.\n\nA: After I installed Ubuntu 13.04 64 bit, I realize that I don't see Steam in the software center anymore. I went to the official steam webpage, and downloaded the application. And installed it. It works fine. its a .deb file, which is easily installed. Btw on the website it is written to install steam on your pc, and it support ms Windows and Mac, but if you click on it using ubuntu it gives you a .deb file to install.\nGood luck\n\nA: if you install the repo as above then you will install the i386 32 bit steam.\nIt would be better to install the 64 bit deb file from the valve website if you have a 64 bit operating system.\n\nA: I followed the steps on the linked page below to add the repository.\nI had the exact same symptoms as the OP.\nSteam still not showing in Software Center though.\nI am now logged in to Steam and downloading Half-Life, which I purchased Years ago.\nNice to see some continuity in account purchases!\nInstructions to add the Steam PPA\nSince Steam is no longer in the Ubuntu repositories it will never show up in Software Center.

Currently I'm running the AMD chip full time with fglrx drivers, and I get OK battery life.  I would like to get another hour or two though, which I feel is quite possible by switching to the Intel HD4000 chip.  In reading the forums I see that it's possible to do via EFI boot, some kernel patches, using both opensource drivers, and vgaswitcheroo.  \nThat isn't quite ideal though.  I'd really like to be using the AMD drivers, but I can't seem to find anywhere (perhaps my google foo is off) how to do this, although I have seen evidence that it is possible (the Ubuntu wiki page on fglrx for example).  I need to be able to switch between both cards, preferably without restarting X and definitely without needing to reboot.  As this is a laptop, I need to be able to run both in power saving (Intel) and with dual displays (as far as I know that will only work with the AMD chip).

I get an error along the lines of \"unable to read something from hd(0,0)\" (I have the exact message written down at my apartment, so I can post that later) however it starts booting after than until it stops (I assume because it can't load the graphics).

There's an Ubuntu bug report about this here, but be aware that it's wider than this. See Matthew Garrett's blog post about the topic for details. Basically, writing enough data to the UEFI storage space, even from Windows, will brick the computer. Thus, the only safe way to use these computers at the moment is to do so entirely in BIOS/legacy/CSM mode. To do this, you'll need to disable EFI support in the firmware, re-install Windows in legacy/BIOS mode (or convert the EFI installation to boot in legacy/BIOS mode, which is likely to be tricky), and install Linux in legacy/BIOS mode. Unfortunately, EFI implementations have completely non-standardized user interfaces, and since I don't own a Samsung, I can't give you directions on how to disable EFI mode and enable legacy/BIOS mode. The best I can suggest is that you enter the firmware setup utility and look for options with promising-sounding names.\nOn computers without this bug, or if/when Samsung fixes it in a firmware update, you can install Ubuntu in EFI mode fairly simply. You'll need Ubuntu 12.10 or later for Secure Boot support or you'll need to disable Secure Boot in the firmware, but in theory it should install pretty much the same way it would install on any other computer. In practice, there are quite a few EFI-specific bugs, but they tend to vary from one computer to another. Thus, there's no way to answer the question as stated without writing a very long response. The best I can say here is to follow the usual Ubuntu installation instructions and, if you run into problems, post a more specific question. I must reiterate, though, that installing Ubuntu in EFI mode on a Samsung laptop is very risky, and I do not recommend you try.\n", "Q: Replacement of all features of Outlook 2010 I'm searching a real replacement of Outlook 2010 and easy2sync for Outlook for mails, schedule and contacts, but I need to synchronize mail by mail and not only the whole file between a desktop and a notebook.

Or you can open that iso image file with a virtual CD program (like clone virtual drive) and install Ubuntu using Wubi ;)\n\nA: Basically you have 2 ways to install Ubuntu alongside (or instead of) Windows: using a physical media (such as a USB stick or a DVD/CD), or inside Windows (as an application with virtual devices) aka Wubi.\nYou've downloaded an ISO file, which is needed and used for the physical media method. This is the old-school, most conventional way of installing Ubuntu (or any OS, as a matter of fact). Most Windows setups don't come with any application that can deal with ISO files out of the box.\nHere's a simple software that I use to mount ISO files as virtual DVDs/CDs: VirtualCloneDrive\nI think you should avoid using the Wubi installation method. From my experience, the result is always a slow and unreliable system.\nI still consider myself a newbie to Linux. Here's the guide that I used to install from a USB stick: QuickUSBInstallGuide. It's very easy to follow and very user friendly.\nIf you'd prefer using a DVD/CD, these guides will work too: HowToBurnISO (instructions on burning an ISO file into a physical DVD/CD), and DVDCDInstallation (guide for the actual installation process).\nAs always, read and understand the documents first before doing anything. Everything will go smoothly! Good luck!\n", "Q: Add custom steps to source package's debian/package.postinst? I have a package that incorporates an auto-generated debian/package.postinst.debhelper file into the generated binary. When I put my own code into a file at debian/package.postinst, the auto-generated file is no longer incorporated into the resulting binary.\nHow do I add custom code to the postinst file in the generated package without blocking the use of the auto-generated code?\n\nA: Your postinst script should included a #DEBHELPER# token if you are using any debhelper commands that might modify it.

I am stuck on version 9.10 Karmic Koala and need to update. I am not very good with computers so any simple and easy instructions would be awesome! \n\nA: If you are looking to update to at least 12.04 from 9.10 you are looking at 3 system updates, I really don't recommend doing this. What I do suggest is download yourself a copy of the latest ISO and make a bootable ISO. From there you will have to boot into the USB or DVD so you will need to go into your BIOS and enable USB booting or Change the boot device priority if it doesn't work right away.\nIf you need help making a bootable Ubuntu USB Drive.. here.\nIf you need help installing Ubuntu.. here\n\nIf you really must upgrade through the terminal then you need to follow these steps\n 1. vi /etc/apt/sources.list\n 2. Replace each maverick universe with precise universe\n 3. aptitude update\n 4. aptitude full-upgrade\n\nBut seriously this is probably going to break the installation but I really suggest making a bootable USB or DVD, it will be much faster and safer.\n\nA: The latest version is 12.10 and there is no way to upgrade directly from 9.10 to 12.10. You would need to step through some versions in between. \nFirst you would need to upgrade 9.10 to 10.04 as described here:\nhttps://help.ubuntu.com/community/EOLUpgrades/Karmic \nThen from 10.04 to 12.04 as described here:\nhttps://help.ubuntu.com/community/PreciseUpgrades \nThen from 12.04 to 12.10 as described here:\nhttp://www.ubuntu.com/download/desktop/upgrade \nEach upgrade would be around 800 MB on average, that's a total of around 2.5 GB (or more) of downloads. If you have the bandwidth for that kind of download and your installation has critical setup that you would want to retain, then above is the upgrade path. \nOtherwise, the best (and simplest) option for you is to take backup of your files and documents stored in /home/username folder and any other folders you created, make a list of applications installed by you. Then do a fresh install of the new/latest version 12.10. Then install the other applications that you may have had earlier. \nBefore doing a fresh install, do check it on your computer with a Live CD/DVD, so you can ensure that your hardware is compatible. \n\nA: Ubuntu 9.10 (Koala) is no longer supported, and so upgrading from 9.10 to 10.04 LTS is also not supported.\nThis rules out upgrading (via multiple steps) to 12.04 or 12.10.\n\n(adapted from: AskUbuntu > Upgrade 9.10 to 10.04 )\nOnce you have your data and settings backed-up, you should do a fresh install of Ubuntu 12.04 LTS on your PC. There will likely be initial issues with drivers, but this should mostly be resolved by doing an update.\nOnce you have 12.04 LTS working, then try out (but do not immediately install) Ubuntu 12.10 (or later 13.04). This may also work on your PC, but with older hardware you are better sticking with the LTS release.\nI have successfully run 12.04 LTS on an HP Mini netbook (Atom processor, 1GB RAM) or ex-corporate desktops (P4 2.8GHz, 1GB RAM).\n", "Q: Increase playback speed of flash videos Is there a general purpose solution to increase the speed of arbitrary (embedded) flash videos (Youtube, vimeo, etc)? \n\nA: I'm not sure about arbitrary embedded Flash videos, but for YouTube, I used to use this Chrome Extension that replaces the Flash player with a VLC player. Playback is much smoother.\nUnfortunately this extension is not working at the moment, not until VLC fixes their Lua script. So now I use this, which basically enqueues the selected YouTube video into my current queue in VLC (it needs to be running or the extension will fail).\nYou can probably try alternative Flash players, like gnash or whatever, but they don't improve much at all.

However, I recommend to set background-color property as well to both code and pre tags. I have set the background-color to LightGrey (its Hex Value is #D3D3D3). You may modify the color to your tastes and preferences.

You need not have to format it to Fat32 or NTFS. \nUbuntu will format the partition as Ext4 during installation. All you have to do is pointing to the correct partition using advanced option and mount it under\"/\"\n\nA: Ubuntu(and even other Linux-based distros) can read almost all file systems. So, to answer your second question first; no, ubuntu won't have trouble reading the other(perhaps the internal) HDD formatted as NTFS or FAT.\nFor your first question, you only need to keep a partition free(any format: NTFS, FAT, ext, or just free) of data to install Ubuntu. Remember: The partition on which you are going to install Ubuntu should not contain data useful to you.\nYou can format it during or before installation with any format as Ubuntu can format it with ext no matter what the previous format was. Also, since its a 2 TB HDD, I presume it has GPT, so you don't need to worry about the 4 primary partition problems related with MBR.\n\nA: You can not partition or format a hard drive for Ubuntu from Windows. This has to be done from the partitioning tool that comes with the live CD.\nWe are able to partition the whole drive from this CD, including a partition formatted NTFS or FAT32 for access from Windows. Just choose \"Something else\" during the installation process. \nBut if you are unexperienced with Ubuntu, and to avoid data loss from accidentally partitioning a drive or partition where you keep your data it is advisable to:\n\n\n*\n\n*make a backup of your important data before you install a new OS  \n\n*let Ubuntu install on a free, unpartitioned space of your drive. Then the installer will automatically take care of proper partitions, and will only use up truly free space on your drive(s).  \n\n*Don't proceed when you have the slightest doubt whether you had set the partitions correctly. Better ask someone first.\n\n\nTo obtain such a free, unpartitioned space just leave 500 GB unpartitioned when you go ahead to partition the new drive from Windows.\n", "Q: Home directory encryption I've just encrypted my home directory after installing ubuntu (i.e. my home directory was initially not encrypted then I used the ecryptfs-utils to encrypt it).\nI am curious to know whether only the current content of home directory would be encrypted or all data saved further will also encrypted?\nThanks in advance.\n\nA: All the future files that you save in your home directory will be encrypted as well.\n", "Q: Directory Permissions / Create Mask (Samba) (Ubuntu Server OS Directorys) I want to understand the permissions a bit more!

I installed Ubuntu 12.04.2 64 bit and then did an update but now Ubuntu won't boot. I have checked to see whether my Laptop is 64 bit (dual core) and it is. \n12.04.2 worked tho. 12.10 64 bit not.

I SSH into a multitude of different servers every day and some of them have different filesystem structures for their websites. Each time I change server, I have to work out where I'm going to get to the files I really want (because it's very rarely that I want to be in ~).\nI use Fabric files to automate all my actions (pushing to git, automated SSH to the server to pull from git, restarting the web application, changing dependencies, etc), so I was wondering if I couldn't also tell it that I want to SSH into the right directory so I can run fab ssh and be in a normal SSH session, just in the right place and start working immediately.\nThis is not about Fabric though; please ignore it. Fabric is just running a batch of commands. My argument is with the ssh command. That's what I'll be telling Fabric to run.\nSo how I can get ssh to cd into a specific directory on login?\nNote: this cannot be a server or user-wide thing. I have multiple websites under one user on some servers so sticking something in ~/.bashrc would not work for me.\n\nA: Well I knew I could run something on login, but I knew it would exit out straight after running. What I now remember is that I can run as much as I like on a remote server. You can just chain the commands together!\nssh user@server -t \"cd /websites/website ; /bin/bash\"\n\nNow I can just tell fabric to do that and we're away. Simple.\n\nI did say it wasn't anything to do with the Fabric but here's the new part of my fabric script too, based on the above:\ndef ssh():\n    ''' SSH into the remote server at the correct directory '''\n    local('ssh -t -p%(port)s %(server)s \"cd %(remote_dir)s ; /bin/bash\"' % {\n        'server': server_host,\n        'port': server_port,\n        'remote_dir': remote_dir,\n    })\n\nI symlink the same script around so the variables (server_host, server_port and remote_dir) change from site to site.\nBecause Fabric can handle the outbound connection you can also just do this:\ndef ssh():\n    ''' SSH into the remote server at the correct directory '''\n    run('cd %s ; /bin/bash' % remote_dir)\n\nThis does work but the output is prepended with a string from Fabric. This made the prompt over 80 chars long and while I've got tons of resolution, that's too much for me :)\n", "Q: Grub not showing after installation I have formatted my machine with ubuntu covering the full drive. \nNow i want to install windows xp on it( dont want to keep ubuntu on it as the user was not computer savvy). \nThe bootable disk is not showing in the screen. \nI believe we have to change some setting in the grub loader of ubuntu - but not sure about this.\nAny ideas?\n\nA: You just need to boot frem the Win XP CDRom and format you Disk with the NTFS Filesystem during the XP INstallation process.

I just want to have a secondary installation with a patched Wine.\nHow do I go about doing this?\n\nA: If you have Wine installed through package management, the wine binary is located in /usr/bin. Then just compile the patched Wine version. \nYou can apply the patches and compile Wine. After the following two commands you can test Wine from the build directory:\n./configure  \nmake \n\nTo install Wine (optional if you plan on running Wine from the build directory). If you run this command, thewine binary usually installs to /usr/local/bin. If you want to define the install location, you can use the configure parameter, for example: ./configure --prefix=/opt/wine157 which installs Wine to /opt/wine157\nsudo make install\n\nExample (on 64 bit system):\nwget http://mirrors.ibiblio.org/wine/source/1.5/wine-1.5.7.tar.bz2\ntar -xvf wine-1.5.7.tar.bz2\ncd wine-1.5.7\nwget ftp://ftp.etersoft.ru/pub/people/amorozov/usb/1.5.7/0001-Add-support-of-native-Windows-drivers-for-USB-tokens.txt\nwget ftp://ftp.etersoft.ru/pub/people/amorozov/usb/1.5.7/0002-Re-generate-some-files.txt\npatch -p1 < 0001*.txt\npatch -p1 < 0002*.txt\n./configure --enable-win64\nmake\n\nTo show the Wine version from the build directory:\n./wine64 --version\n\nInstallation:\nsudo make install\n\nUninstall:\nsudo make uninstall\n\nSee:\n\n\n*\n\n*How to compile wine\n\n*Installing Wine 1.5: configure: error: Cannot build a 32-bit program, you need to install 32-bit development libraries\n\n*Building 32-bit Wine on a 64-bit (x86-64) system\n", "Q: How to hide rulers, statusbar, scrollbars in GIMP persistently?

How do I make them disappear forever?\nI have also disabled the menubar and that stays hidden, just as I want it.

All routers must discard packet with such addresses. Use another address range, e.g. Unique LocaL Addresses fd00::/8 (RFC 4193).

Linux has its own set of software and cannot run Windows .exe files to install any software. Instead, software must either be installed from original developer's code, called source code, or the package manager must be used. The Ubuntu Software Center is the default package manager.

I have a tricky problem regarding multiple monitors on KDE (Kubuntu). I have a laptop which, at home, is connected to two monitors - VGA and HDMI. That works only when the built-in laptop display is disabled (at least I was told that). \nThe problem is that now I took the laptop away and booted it up with no external monitors connected. The system remembers that the built-in display was disabled, so it disables it even though it is the only monitor connected. Obviously, that makes the laptop pretty much unusable. Switching to a terminal through Ctrl+Alt+F# works, I can login; even Guest works normally.\nThe question is, how do I (re)set an account's monitor settings through terminals, since I can't use the GUI? \nThanks\n\nA: Good question. A bit tricky to answer, but here is a try.\nBasic Answer\nThere is actually a little reset possiblity included in X11. You can find it at /etc/X11/Xreset. You could use the Xreset directory (Xreset.d) to paste a script that runs automatically when a user logs out. The README file:\n# Scripts in this directory are executed as root when a user log out from\n# a display manager using /etc/X11/Xreset.\n# The username of the user logging out is provided in the $USER environment\n# variable.\n\nYou could thus a) add a reset script in /etc/X11/Xreset.d and b) make a script attached to a launcher that sets your dual external displays up. As such, you would log off and everything would be back to normal, you would log on to your laptop, hit the launcher for the displays and enjoy life.\nMore information\n\n*\n\n*You might want to look into sudo dpkg-reconfigure -phigh xserver-xorg for resetting the xserver or (probably better look at the answer Mik suggested in the comments).\n\n\n*A SuSE guy wrote a nice article about X.\n\n\n*In a solved bugreport someone states:\n\nadmins can drop scripts in /etc/X11/Xreset.d/ to run after the user logs out.\n\n\n\n*This is the contents of the file:\nYou can find it on your own system.\n#!/bin/sh\n#\n# /etc/X11/Xreset\n#\n# global Xreset file -- for use by display managers\n \n# $Id: Xsession 967 2005-12-27 07:20:55Z dnusinow $\n\nset -e\n \nPROGNAME=Xreset\nSYSSESSIONDIR=/etc/X11/Xreset.d\n \nif [ ! -d \"$SYSSESSIONDIR\" ]; then\n  # Nothing to do, exiting\n  exit 0\nfi\n\n# use run-parts to source every file in the session directory; we source\n# instead of executing so that the variables and functions defined above\n# are available to the scripts, and so that they can pass variables to each\n# other\nSESSIONFILES=$(run-parts --list $SYSSESSIONDIR)\nif [ -n \"$SESSIONFILES\" ]; then\n  set +e\n  for SESSIONFILE in $SESSIONFILES; do\n    . $SESSIONFILE\n  done\n  set -e\nfi \n\nexit 0\n\n# vim:set ai et sts=2 sw=2 tw=80:\n\n\nA: have you tried (sth like)\nDISPLAY=:0 xrandr --output LVDS1 --auto\n\nfrom a different tty (e.g. tty1),\nwhich you can access through Ctrl Alt F1 and switch back to (the standard graphical) tty7 with Ctrl Alt F7?\n\nA: The command xrandr -s 0 should reset your displays in terminal.  More can be found at the following site or from man xrandr in terminal.\nhttps://linuxacademy.com/blog/linux/solution-resetting-your-screen-resolution-with-xrandr/\n\nA: One thing I haven't mentioned yet, but what might be critical: if you were using a Thinkpad laptop, the solution would be straightforward: Fn+F7. If you're using a different manufacturer's laptop, there will, in good likelihood, be some other Fn-type key which will toggle through the display/screen outputs (e.g., beamer, external monitor, internal display; mirror, on/off, and the like) down at the BIOS level (I'd assume - Edit: See How do Fn keys work? for more details on this).\nSo there'd be no need to reset anything within Linux, so to speak.\n\nA: Whenever I put my Lubuntu laptop to sleep when it's exclusively displaying on my TV and wake it up after having unplugged it, I end up with a black screen because the wrong resolution is assigned. So same problem as you, I need to set the resolution from the TTY1 virtual terminal I can reach with Ctrl-alt-F1, but xrandr doesn't seem to work. I scoured pages of Google search results before coming upon the solution, so I thought I'd share.\nThe key thing is that xrandr apparently only works on the currently focused display. So you have to chain a sleep command before your xrandr command to give you time to switch back to the X server with Ctlr-alt-F7 so the command is executed there. Otherwise you get an error like xrandr: Configure crtc 0 failed.\n\n\n*\n\n*Open virtual terminal with Ctrl-alt-F1 and log in\n\n\nTo get the names of connected screens (and assuming your X server is running on :0 ):\n\n\n*$xrandr -d :0\nTo modify display settings:\n\n\n*$sleep 5; xrandr --output LVDS1 --auto -d :0\nSubstitute LVDS1 by the output you want to modify, and --auto by whatever xrandr parameters you wanna use.\n\n\n*Switch to the X server with Ctrl-alt-F7 before the sleep delay you set in the command above elapses.\n\n\nThere HAS to be a better way to do this. But it works.\nOriginal source for the solution: http://www.lgqyc.com/server-14-04-3-lts-display-orientation/\nCheck out this comment for a possible improvement to my solution (not tested myself).\n", "Q: Unity switcher theme Is it possible to modify the Unity switcher theme and behavior?

I've read that PAM can be used to restrict HTTP access for some users, but I can't figure out how to do it in Ubuntu 12.04.\nThe /etc/security/time.conf man page contains this example:\nAll users except for root are denied access to console-login at all times:\n\n    login ; tty* & !ttyp* ; !root ; !Al0000-2400\n\nFor this to work, /etc/pam.d/login needs to have a line\naccount    requisite  pam_time.so\n\nThis example works, and I tried to adapt it to limit HTTP access from the console. I added\nhttp ; tty* & !ttyp* ; !root ; !Al0000-2400\n\nto /etc/security/time.conf, and created /etc/pam.d/http with\naccount    requisite  pam_time.so\n\nThis doesn't work. I can still use wget as non-root from the console.\n\nA: You can't -- wget doesn't use PAM. A program must be explicitly designed to call PAM for it to have any affect.

When clicking the application icon, a birdview of all the windows will be shown, and you can click any window in the birdview to restore that window and switch the current focus to that window. \nBut when there are more and more windows opened for an application, each window in the birdview  will be smaller and harder  to be seen clearly of what it is about, which makes selecting the desired window more difficult. \nThere is another thing adding to the difficulty. When you go back and forth between clicking application icon to see the birdview of multiple windows and selecting one window from the birdview, the order of the windows in the birdview will change from time to time when you click to see the birdview.

I have been running Ubuntu for over a year on my laptop and I've really come to enjoy it.  So much that it has replaced Windows in my day-to-day activities.\nYesterday an error occurred on my desktop version of 12.04 that caused it to fail to boot.  In the process, I lost the contents of my home folder despite creating a back up of the home folder.\nHere is the time line:\nFeb 18, 2013 - Installed Ubuntu 12.04 LTS on desktop via Wubi.  The install went as advertised and I proceeded to apply personal tweaks to make both the laptop and the desktop essentially the same.  Everything functioned normally.\nFeb 19-23 - Began moving files from the laptop to the desktop in an effort to centralize my own files.  The intent was to use Dropbox as a sort of \"briefcase\", and use the laptop when I needed to be mobile.\nFeb 24 - Everything functioned normally through the day.  I switched to Windows to continue sending things to Dropbox as I could not see any of the Ubuntu folders in my Windows Explorer.  As this was my first dual boot experience, I assumed this was normal.\nWhile in Windows, the HP Desktop Assistant informed me it needed to do system maintenance (I use windows only for MS Flight Sim - it is infrequent).  I delayed it by one hour.  System did not ask me again, and I assume it went ahead and did what it needed to do while files were being moved to Dropbox.\nSystem failed to boot 12.04.  Internet research lead me to believe the GRUB2 had somehow become corrupt (possibly during the above Windows maintenance).  At this time I created a bootable USB using UNetBootin.\nThis gained access to a terminal where I ran \"boot-repair\".  Boot Repair found an issue and advised me to back up my files.  I proceeded to put the contents of my Home folder on another USB.  After this process had completed, the system became unresponsive - I could not double check that the files had actually moved.\nI believed I had enough evidence that the transfer had taken place, I opted to remove Wubi, and do a true dual boot of Ubuntu in its own partition, hoping this would prevent this error from happening again.  When that had completed, I found the USB contained only the folders within my Home folder from the previous Wubi install.\nI have run Photorec, as suggested below.  It recovered fragments of files, but not a whole file.  I suspect this occurred when I attempted another Wubi install in the hopes that it would locate my old home folder (this was done prior to asking for help from ask ubuntu).\nI am still seeking solution, but I believe the contents of my previous Home folder are now unrecoverable.\nI'm running Ubuntu 12.04 on its own partition (now), 64 bit\nWindows 7 is on the other partition (where the Wubi install was)\nIf any other details will be helpful, I'll be glad to provide.  Also, I'm not afraid of the command line.\nEDIT This question can be closed.  User bcbc gave the best answer in another forum: http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=2065355\nIf the home folder is lost during a Wubi uninstall (as mine was) then it is gone. I believe it would have been recoverable had I not attempted another Wubi install this morning (prior to asking the above question) prior to running programs that can recover deleted data.\nTough lesson to learn. Thank you to those who took the time to help out.\n\nA: When you install ubuntu using wubi, you are installing it as and app inside windows. Anyway, in order to find your files on your usb disk, first try to check unused space of your usb disk. If it shows that you have your files there, then make sure that they are not hidden by any means. If you didn't have your files on your usb disk, then try to recover them using a cool tool named testdisk. And durin doing these steps Don't write anything on your usb disk, this may cause loss of data.\n", "Q: Who is starting xbindkeys? When I restart my computer, xbindkeys is launched but it doesn't work right. If I kill it and then manually start it with nohup xbindkeys, it works fine. I think it'll work fine if I put it into my .xsessionrc file. But something else is already starting it when I boot, which interferes.\nI recursively searched /etc for xbindkeys with no success.\n\nA: I have found that xbindkeys is automatically started if you have an .xbindkeysrc in your home folder or in a system folder such as /etc. Hence why it does not usually need to be added as a separate startup item once installed.\nThis is explained well in the file /etc/X11/Xsession.d/98xbindkeys, which is generated by any normal install from the Ubuntu package. Here is a snippet from the file, generated by running cat /etc/X11/Xsession.d/98xbindkeys:\nThis file is sourced by Xsession(5), not executed.\n\nPROG=\"/usr/bin/xbindkeys\"\nNOAUTO=\"${HOME}/.xbindkeys.noauto\"\n\nThis file autostarts xbindkeysrc if the user (or system) has a config\nfor it AND does NOT Have a .xbindkeys.noauto in his homedir.\n\n[The rest of the file is a script]\n\nSo, the simple solution is to take note of the instructions and place a file named .xbindkeys.noauto in your home directory, and then xbindkeys won't start up with your x session, and you can place an alternative startup entry for it with your specific needs.\n\nA: I experienced the same problem when trying to get the touchpad on/off button working on my HP G60-530US laptop. When I login xbindkeys was running, killing xbindkeys & restarting xbindkeys would sometimes work. killing xbindkeys, running xbindkeys-config 'apply, save & exit' worked, but was pretty cumbersome.\nTrying Mik's suggestion appeared to not work as I already had a 'xbindkeys' in my gnome-session-properties (gsp). I then remembered that just typing in the command in gsp often doesn't work; instead I click the 'browse' button and browsed to /usr/bin/xbindkeys to set the key. Logged out and logged backing and the mouse touchpad on/off buttons are now working properly.\nHP G60-530US specific:\n\n\n*\n\n*relevant bits of ~/.xbindkeysrc (the rest of the file is default):\n#TouchpadOff - works\n\"synclient TouchpadOff=1\"\n   0x1008ffb1\n\n#TouchpadOn - works\n\"synclient TouchpadOff=2\"\n   0x1008ffb0\n\n\n*.xbindkeys.noauto is present in user home profile:  \n~/.xbindkeys.noauto\n\n\n*Enabled /usr/bin/xbindkeys was set using gnome-session-properties Startup Application Preferences. Important part (for me) was setting the command using the 'browse' button in the UI.  \nName: xbindkeys\nCommand: /usr/bin/xbindkeys\nComments: Touchpad on/off\n\n\nA: I had an issue with the same symptoms: xbindkeys appear to have been started, but no shortcut worked. After manually restarting xbindkeys from a shell it worked as expected.\nMy problem was that the commands tied to the shortcuts were dependent on my shell config (trying to start a Ruby command, but Ruby was loaded with asdf which is sourced in my .zshrc)\nSolution was to replace the xbindkeys startup command from xbindkeys to /usr/bin/zsh -c \"xbindkeys\" and also move the asdf setup from .zshrc to .zshenv, since the latter is loaded even if no tty is present.\nThe startup command was editable from \"Startup applications\" in my Ubuntu 16.04.\n\nA: I dealt with this issue by running xbindkeys in terminal on startup!\nAdd Terminal=true in your .desktop file.\n", "Q: Is it possible to make a file that has full permissions for everybody but is impossible to delete? Without using sudo, preferably?\n\nA: It's a little crude, but this is close - if you remove write access on the directory, files inside it can't be deleted.  And it doesn't require sudo if you own it:\n=^_^= izkata@izein:~$ mkdir test\n=^_^= izkata@izein:~$ touch test/delme\n=^_^= izkata@izein:~$ chmod a-w test\n=^_^= izkata@izein:~$ echo 'Hello' > test/delme \n=^_^= izkata@izein:~$ cat test/delme \nHello\n=^_^= izkata@izein:~$ rm test/delme \nrm: cannot remove `test/delme': Permission denied\n\nSo you can set permissions on the file itself however you want.\nAlso, as stated by @Rinzwind, there's certainly many ways around it.\n\nA: To delete a file, you need write permission to all the directories that file is linked to. To unlink it from one directory, you need write permission to that directory.\nSo as long as you give write permission (or even ownership) to the file but not to the directory or directories that file is linked to, that file can't be deleted.\nThe best way to achieve it would be to link that file to a directory that is owned by root and that is not writeable by anybody. You could make it owned by you instead which would mean both you and root could delete it.\nThat would still allow other users to link that file to other directories and unlink it from there thereafter, but they still wouldn't be able to delete the file as they would be able to unlink it from your own directory.\nNote that for that to work fully, the writing permission of every path component to the file would have to be controlled. Because for instance if the file is /a/b/the-file and you have /a/b not writeable by anybody but everybody has write access to /a, then they could rename /a/b to something else and recreate their own /a/b and create their own /a/b/the-file there.\n\nA: Try:\nchattr +i filename\n\nDoing this though, will make the file undelete-able even by the root user - use with caution.\n\nA: No, this is not possible. Impossible for normal users to delete a file: sure.\n\n\n*\n\n*You will need sudo to prevent users to delete files. Your administrator will -always- be able to delete a file. \n\n*sudo chattr +i test can prevent deletion but does requires sudo. A simple sudo chattr -i test makes it possible to remove the file. No other user than admin can use chattr.\nAnd... simply rebooting and going into rescue mode will allow that person to be able to delete that file. It would be a security risk if there was a method to never be able to delete a file.\n", "Q: After resuming my laptop it is unlocked for a while before locking When I close my laptop lid and it is suspended, when I open it again it is resumed but without showing the lock screen which is set to come up.

The error message reflects that there are missing kernel files.  You can rectify this on any version of Ubuntu with the following command:\n    sudo apt-get install linux-image-$(uname -r)\n\n\nA: The iptables command administers your 'firewall' (or in technical terms: packet filter). It needs more permissions than a normal user has. So entering the command as a normal user leads to the error message you posted.

I am using ubuntu 12.04 (switched from windows 8 recently) and I am finding that this OS is draining my laptops battery like anything (works only like 70% of windows).\nI also found this interesting quote from wikipedia:\nUbuntu 10.04 LTS has also been criticized for its poor battery life on Laptops and Netbooks, even as OEM on devices such as Asus's eeePC, when compared to Microsoft Windows 7, with Ubuntu having been shown to use between 14–56% more power.[122] Ubuntu's developers have acknowledged and sought to solve the issues of power consumption in the 12.04 LTS release.\nCan ubuntu experts suggest me some tips and tricks to save my battery life ?\nAlso tell me how can I monitor my battery usage, like which application/process is more resource(power) consumptive ? Is there any way we can select system performance schemes like we do in Windows like High Performance or Battery Saver types ?\nI also see a problem with my ubuntu display brightness setting. I manually set it to lowest possible but ubuntu forgets my setting everytime I reboot my machine. Is there any way we can permanently save this setting and ubuntu can remember it ?\n\nA: Well for the brightness you should look here. You can't make Ubuntu remember your brightness settings but it will always boot with a predefined brightness level.\nFor the battery life you have to activate laptop-mode. It might not be active by default. To check on that here is a link to a complete walk through.\nFor the high performance and such power schema you can download Jupiter. You can copy and paste the following commands in a command line:\nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:webupd8team/jupiter\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get install jupiter\n\nEDIT: Also Web-E has a great point, you should check if you have two graphic cards (i.e. nVidia Optimus technology - most modern laptops have this technology). If you do, you can install Bumblebee and then you can run every graphic intensive application using the command optirun before it.\n", "Q: Is it important which comes first ,root or swap partition on my external drive? I am trying to creat root , swap and home partition in order to install ubuntu onto my external hard drive.I use the program called Gparted.\nBut some people say first section must be root ,other say swap on disk..\nWhich one is true?\nthanks\n\nA: There is no requirement for any order of your partitions.\nDepending on the type of your hard drive, a partition on the logical start of your disk may be \"quicker\", because the positioning of read head is quicker here. On some other drives this may be true at the logical end of your disk.\nYou have to benchmark your disk to detect the quickest area.\nHistorically, you have had the opportunity to gain some performance if you optimize your system this way a little bit.\nWith modern Solid State Drives this makes no sense any more.\nAnd also on traditional Hard Disk Drives this makes no sense, if you are using LVM or RAID.\nOne additional note:\nIf you use the modern GPT instead the MSDOS label, you don't have to think about primary and extended partitions.\n parted /dev/sdX mklabel gpt\n\n\nA: Typically , I have seen / as the first partition, but I guess it doesn't really matter.\n", "Q: block outgoing internet calls from inside a container This question is not similar to my earlier post.

How can I perform this upgrade? I'm even willing o clear the computer's HDD if necessary.\nThanks al lot!\n\nA: \nWhich brings me to the question: what are held packages?\n\nHeld packages are packages that the Ubuntu team has specifically set to not upgrade. They usually do this for compatibility and/or stability reasons.\nAs for your broken packages issue, have you tried going through the GUI? You might be able to do what's known as a partial upgrade, which may fix the broken packages. You can try this by going to \"System Updates\" and letting it scan and update. You may need to restart your computer for everything to take effect.\nAnother option is to go into \"Software Sources\", make sure all of the Ubuntu repositories are selected (universe, multiverse, restricted), and then run sudo apt-get update. Including these repositories makes more packages available, which may include updates to the packages in question.\nYou may also be able to repair the install just like how you tried with the boot CD. If you have another computer, verify that the disc does, in fact, still work by putting it into the other computer (you don't have to install anything, just see if it takes you to the setup screens that you couldn't reach on this computer). If it doesn't, just burn another CD, or create a bootable USB if you have one, and try again.\nIf you're willing to risk having to do a clean install, you can try to reinstall the packages (the ones that marked for uninstall that you didn't mark are packages that depend on the ones you did mark). (The usual method of fixing broken packages is to uninstall and reinstall the offending package.) One of the nice things about Linux is that what runs in memory often stays in memory until you tell it to quit or reload. This means that you might not bring your system down during the process, as long as you don't restart before installing everything again.\n", "Q: \"Installation Type\" options I am trying to install ubuntu onto my external drive via liveUSB.I created three parts called root,swap and home by using GParted.Now it time to install Ubuntu .I came to \"Installation Type\" window.I can see the partitions I have created.I chose my external disk as a \"device for boot loader installation\" but what makes me confused is that \n\n\n*\n\n*Do I have to creat another partition here ?\n\n*When I clicked sdc1/ext4 and clicked \"change\" icon I see that it says \" dont use the partition\"  is it ok? should I change it?\n\n*And which part should be highlighted when I clicked \"install\"?  dev/sdc  or  dev/sdc1 or  dev/sdc2 or  dev/sdc3\nthanks\n\nA: I would run the USB installer again , setup your partitions on the external HDD and from the dropdown that says \"select device for bootloader installation\" select the external HDD .

Unfortunately, what i did wasn't pretty. I created a new account and then deleted EVERYTHING from my home directory and moved everything from the new account to it. Meaning that I had to reconfigure everything. Of course, shortly after that I found a possible solution to the problem. The problem MAY be caused by a corrupted highlighting definition file. To easily test this try disabling highlighting and see if the issue goes away.\nIf that worked for you then you'll need to get another copy of your highlighting definitions which aren't borked. You say you can use other accounts just fine so try to just use the ~/.kde/share/apps/katepart folder from a working account in your account. Just delete yours and copy the other over to the same place in you profile.\nHope it helps and let me know.\n\nA: Having the same issue. A workaround is to change the font size.

Trying to remove and reinstall the linux-generic package seems rather risky, but maybe that would solve it?\n\nA: Removing linux-generic will do no harm at all. It is only a \"meta-package\" depending on linux-image-generic and linux-headers-generic. Those two are themselves meta-packages depending on the respective latest image/headers packages.\nYou can see this for yourself by issuing apt-cache show linux-generic, apt-cache show linux-image-generic and apt-cache show linux-headers-generic.\nThe purpose of meta-packages is to pull-in the packages on which they depend, they have no functionality at all.

It is a shot in the dark, but I have tried everything to reinstall Eclipse.  I did the normal apt-get install for Eclipse.\nI used it for a year.  And then I decided I wanted to select the \"Upgrade Option\" from the Eclipse Help menu.  After 30 minutes of many downloads, I restarted Eclipse and none of the perspectives worked.  Essentially, when I tried to upgrade through Eclipse, nothing worked afterwards.\nI did the apt-get autoremove and many ways to remove from Eclipse.\nI tried to remove eclipse through apt and also removed some /lib files.  But everytime I install I end up at the same place, Eclipse just won't work.  I am sure there are residual files out there, I just don't know where.\n...\nWhen I download Eclipse from the site, it works fine.  I am OK with working this way but I thought I would ask if there is a way to fix the eclipse configuration that comes with Ubuntu.\n\nA: First, try sudo apt-get purge eclipse followed by sudo apt-get autoremove, sudo apt-get clean, and sudo apt-get autoclean. Then, try reinstalling Eclipse.\nIf this doesn't work, move on to the directions below:\nEclipse files are also stored in a per-user directory in one's home folder, namely .eclipse, as well as the workspace folder you select at Eclipse startup(unless you set it to never ask you again). You can try renaming these folders in order to reset Eclipse.\nOpen your home folder, and press Ctrl+H to see hidden files. Find .eclipse and rename it to .eclipseOld. You can also rename your workspace folder in the same way. \nThen, reinstall Eclipse via apt (sudo apt-get install eclipse) and try using it again.\n\nA: In my opinion, I never meet anybody using Eclipse's Ubuntu's packages. And I don't think it is made for being used this way. My boss often told me that he don't care which OS he runs while working under Eclipse because anyway his main OS was Eclipse and SVN and it changes nothing for him to use it under Windows or Ubuntu or anything else. I think he is right.\nDealing with Eclipse configurations files and workspaces is tricky : handle with care !  \n", "Q: Windows 8 Dual Boot on standard bios (Without UEFI) I am using old computer standard phoenix BIOS, it does not have UEFI.\nI was installed Windows 8 first, then Ubuntu.\nWhen grub installed, I can't access Windows 8 anymore.\nupdate-grub can't find my windows, bootrepair can't repair.\nAfter tried grub-customizer.

I know what /usr/local is for - installing software for the local machine. By default, root owns the directory. This means that to install there, you need to use sudo. For a single-user or developer machine, this seems like unnecessary extra use of the command. Hence, my question - is it safe for me to own /usr/local?\nFor example, Homebrew for OS X \"Just Works\" because they own /usr/local and safely install their software there without the use of sudo.\nAdditionally, if you have locally compiled software installed to /usr/local, the software currently needs root to modify themselves or install plugins. This seems unsafe  - I want to only use sudo when I know EXACTLY what will happen.\nOpinions?\n\nA: It is unusual that /usr/local isn't owned by root.\nBut you can change the owner as you want.\nBut I advise to ensure that /usr/local/sbin is still owned by root to avoid a security problem. The commands here are usually invoked only by root.\n\nA: I can't recommend becoming the owner of /usr/local; for most situations, it's probably less secure than using sudo.\nYour question suggests two reasons you might want to chown /usr/local.\nThe first is to avoid having to use sudo to install software. This might read to some (such as the author of this answer) as saying you want to work efficiently, or save the keystrokes needed to type sudo and enter your password. But probably when you say \"unnecessary,\" you are referring instead to the principle of least privilege:\n\nBy default, root owns the directory. This means that to install there, you need to use sudo. For a single-user or developer machine, this seems like unnecessary extra use of the command\n\nI quite often hear/read folks opining/complaining along the lines of \"I'm the only one who uses this system, so I shouldn't need to use sudo and enter a password.\" For readers who are of that view, and because it's relevant here, let's remind ourselves of a basic security reason for root to own things.\nMost of the program files installed on an Ubuntu system have file mode 755, or in symbolic notation rwxr-xr-x, meaning that any user or program can execute them, but only the owner of the files, root, can modify them. (Technically this also requires that no one but root have the w permission on the directory that contains them, so other users can't delete or move them.)\nThis means that you, the humble user, may execute any program. If you try to use a program to do something you don't have permission to do, like perform a write operation on a file owned by root, it will error out. This makes a typo in some command, a buggy application, or malicious code, less likely to mess up your system - unless it's running as root, it won't have permission to do so. This is especially useful when running programs that interact with the internet.\nIf you chown /usr/local, any program running with your privileges could write files there, which might later get executed as root for some reason, such as by superseding another command of the same name. /usr/local/bin is in the default $PATH, and in sudo's secure_path, and it comes before other locations in both. So if I have two executables\n/usr/local/bin/chown\n/bin/chown\n\nwhen I execute sudo chown ..., the chown in /usr/local/bin will be executed.\nBut you probably already knew all that, since your second reason is about security:\n\nAdditionally, if you have locally compiled software installed to /usr/local, the software currently needs root to modify themselves or install plugins. This seems unsafe - I want to only use sudo when I know EXACTLY what will happen.\n\nJust in case it's necessary to mention this here, it's absolutely right (according to the FHS anyway) to install locally compiled software to /usr/local, but compiling itself should be done somewhere in your $HOME, without sudo, until the last step when you type sudo make install or equivalent.\nI think you're suggesting that by running a program installed in /usr/local as its unprivileged owner, you could use specific permission errors thrown when it tries to update itself to see that it's trying to modify some other filesystem location not owned by you in a way you don't want, so that you could stop it from doing so.\nThis might be helpful. The implication is that you trust the program to do anything it likes within /usr/local, but not elsewhere. If it requests elevated permissions, you could refuse to allow it to update, or uninstall it. That makes some sense to me. But I think trying to use /usr/local as a kind of sandbox in this way is probably not a good idea, or at least it's unlikely to be the most secure solution. It's not a properly isolated location (/opt is a little more isolated, since it's not in the default $PATH). The program might write or delete something in /usr/local to cause harm. Other (potentially poorly written) programs you run may write and execute code there that you aren't aware of. \nIf you're worried about allowing a program to update itself securely, you should probably look for alternatives (specific to the program perhaps, as with python for example, or you could look for a snap or similar implementation that suits your needs, or use containers or a VM to test potentially unsafe software) before exposing a system location (even a relatively user-y one) to be written to by programs run by a normal user. That seems to me as likely to have unpredictable effects as allowing programs temporarily elevated permissions with sudo.\n\nA: For software only you need, use your home directory instead of /usr/local.\nInstead of changing the ownership of /usr/local or having to run commands as root when you don't want to, you should just configure your builds so they install in your home directory instead of /usr/local. This addresses all the potential problems with changing the ownership of /usr/local, including how its bin and sbin subdirectories are in root's path.\nIf you do need to allow other users to run your software, you can give them access. In fact, they will probably be able to already, because by default your home directory has permissive read and execute access. (If you don't want that, you can change it quite easily, just by using chmod on whatever files or directories you want to make private and possibly also changing your umask.)\nWith software installed in your home directory, binaries that would have gone in /usr/local/bin will instead go in /home/username/bin. You will get other subdirectories of your home directory corresponding to the subdirectories of /usr/local that the software you install needs. This will typically happen automatically when you install software from source code.\nConfiguring Your Builds\nMost software you build from source code has a step where you run:\n./configure\n\nFor the great majority of software that ships with a configure script that can be run like that, it defaults to configuring the build for installation inside /usr/local when you eventually run sudo make install to install it. The reason is that it is implicitly equivalent to running:\n./configure --prefix=/usr/local\n\nTo configure a build for installation in your home directory, use this instead:\n./configure --prefix=\"$HOME\"\n\nIn practice, in Ubuntu, home directory paths don't contain spaces, other whitespace, or other characters that will be treated specially by the shell like *, so unless you've set up your user account quite oddly, you can just type:\n./configure --prefix=$HOME\n\n(I don't recommend getting in the habit of that for writing scripts, though. Also, on some other OSes--such as macOS--it's less uncommon for the paths to users' home directories to contain spaces.)\nOr if you prefer you can type out your full home directory path:\n./configure --prefix=/home/username\n(Replace username with your actual username, of course. If for some reason your home directory isn't in /home then you'll have to adjust accordingly.)\nInstalling Your Builds\nAfter you run make, you may be accustomed to running sudo make install, but when you install in your own home directory, you don't need to run it as root, so you can--and should--omit sudo. Just run:\nmake install\n\nSimilarly, for software that supports an uninstall target:\nmake uninstall\n\nThis is exactly what you were asking for... just in your home directory, not /usr/local.\nRunning Your Programs\nProbably the bin subdirectory of your home directory is either:\n\n*\n\n*already in your $PATH, or\n\n*will be in your $PATH if you just log out and back in.\n\nThe reason is that the .profile file in your home directory, which contains commands that run when you log in, contains this by default for user accounts created in most versions of Ubuntu (including the initial administrator account created when you install the OS):\n# set PATH so it includes user's private bin if it exists\nif [ -d \"$HOME/bin\" ] ; then\n    PATH=\"$HOME/bin:$PATH\"\nfi\n\nThat code runs when you log in (because it's in .profile) and places your personal bin directory in $PATH only if it exists at that time. That's why you may need to log out and back in.\nOlder releases like Ubuntu 14.04, as well as newer releases like Ubuntu 17.10, come with that. However, Ubuntu 16.04, which is probably the most popular release as of this writing, has this instead:\n# set PATH so it includes user's private bin directories\nPATH=\"$HOME/bin:$HOME/.local/bin:$PATH\"\n\nThat simply adds the bin subdirectory of your home directory---as well as the .local/bin subdirectory--to your $PATH, without checking if those directories actually exist. So if you use 16.04, or if you upgraded from a system that was 16.04 when your user account was created, then the bin subdirectory of your home directory is likely already in your $PATH.\nYour .profile file is copied from the /etc/skel directory when your user account is created. If your user account was created on an older Ubuntu release, it got that version of .profile, and it was not changed--for your user account--by upgrading to a more recent release.\nOnce the bin subdirectory of your home directory is in your $PATH, you will be able to run programs whose executable files are installed there just by typing their names, just as you could do with programs installed by Ubuntu's package manager or installed inside /usr/local.\nThe .local Option\nYou may have noticed that the default .profile file for user accounts created in some Ubuntu releases, including in 16.04 as described above, adds not just $HOME/bin to your path, but also $HOME/.local/bin. If your .profile doesn't add that, but you want it to, then you can simply edit it in.\nThough often used to store settings and cached data, you can also install software inside the .local subdirectory of your home directory. You should feel uninhibited in doing so, as from a usability and security standpoint, --prefix=\"$HOME/.local\" is similar to --prefix=\"$HOME\".\nRemember that files and directories that start with . are not shown by default in graphical file browsers (use Ctrl+H to unhide and rehide them) or by the ls command (pass the -A or -a flag to show them). This may not be what you want, or it may be exactly what you want. This is a matter of personal preference.\nHowever, I have observed that some automated source-based package managers that build and install software in one's home directory use $HOME/.local. I don't actually know how common this is--I hope to investigate further and update this answer--but you may prefer to just use $HOME for things you compile manually. That way it will be clear where things came from. And if there is a collision, the software is still likely to coexist acceptably.\nYou may also deliberately install some software in $HOME/.local and other software in $HOME. It's up to you. Whichever bin directory appears first in your $PATH environment variable is the one that a command will run from, in the event that commands of the same name exist in both.\n\nCredit goes to Zanna and Videonauth for pointing out errors in a previous version of this answer, regarding which Ubuntu releases have which default code in .profile, and helping me to correct them (see also here).\n\nA: If sudo is such an inconvenience then just update /etc/sudoers so you don't have to enter your password when you run sudo. I believe that is a better solution than changing the owner of /usr/local. \n", "Q: Package for Ruby 2.0 on precise Has there been any news from the maintainers of Ubuntu packaging of Ruby as to whether they'll be releasing a package for Ruby 2.0? If so, have they indicated whether they'll be releasing any packages for Ruby 2.0 on 12.04?\n\nA: Ubuntu has Stable Release Updates Policy which basically disallow importing new versions into stable releases.  So it's not possible to have official Ruby 2.0 packages in the Ubuntu 12.04, because it could introduce new bugs, regressions, etc.  So you will have to rely on some future-to-be PPA.\nJust to clarify whole process, how does a package enter Ubuntu.  Because Ruby 2.0 is not even packaged yet.\nThe usual release process of Ubuntu is to wait for packages to appear in Debian first and import them from there.\nThat said the Debian is frozen right now and next stable release should be released soon, so not much progress is happening.  But... there's already ITP (Intent to Package) bug for ruby2.0, which means that Ruby packagers are already working on that.  You can track the progress in the git://anonscm.debian.org/collab-maint/ruby2.0.git repository, and even help.\nThe sooner the ruby2.0 appears in Debian, the sooner it will be in next Ubuntu, but it won't be backported automatically to already released versions of Ubuntu.\n\nA: You can easily build the latest version yourself:\nSimply go to http://cache.ruby-lang.org/pub/ruby/ and identify the version you'd like to install in .tar.gz format. Then install via console:\nsudo apt-get -y update\nsudo apt-get -y install build-essential zlib1g-dev libssl-dev libreadline6-dev libyaml-dev\ncd /tmp\nwget http://cache.ruby-lang.org/pub/ruby/2.1/ruby-2.1.1.tar.gz\ntar -xvzf ruby-2.1.1.tar.gz\ncd ruby-2.0.0-p353/\n./configure --prefix=/usr/local\nmake\nsudo make install\n\nThis example installs ruby 2.1.1, simply replace the URI after the wget command with your preferred version.\n\nA: You could use the following PPA:\nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:brightbox/ruby-ng-experimental\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get install -y ruby2.0 ruby2.0-dev ruby2.0-doc\n\nOptional:\nsudo apt-get install -y mysql-server mysql-workbench\nsudo gem install rails\n\nNow you can go ahead and download your preferred IDE and start having fun with Ruby 2.0 and Rails 4.\nJust so you know, I find this one here very cool: http://www.jetbrains.com/ruby/\nNote: you can use any other database and IDE, these are just my personal preferences.\n\nA: The developers have not commented on this to the extent of my knowledge but since the release date of ruby 1.9.3 was october 2011 and to this day 1.9.3 is still not in 11.10, I would say it is unlikely that new rubies will be added after release of the system. A quick look at packages.ubuntu.com shows that the developers have a history of not adding rubies to ubuntu that are released after ubuntu is released.  That being said, there are other ways to install ruby 2.0 if you need such as installing from source, rvm, or ruby-build (with or without rbenv or chruby). I use ruby 2.0 on my system that I installed using ruby-build and rbenv and have had no issues so far.  Based on past history I would say it is unlikely the developers will add ruby 2.0 to the official 12.04 or even 12.10 repositories, however this does not mean it will for sure not happen. 2.0 has yet to be included in the 13.04 repositories either so it is possible it is just tested thoroughly enough by the developers and it could still be added. I would not count on that though.\n\nA: You can install Ruby with the Ruby Version Manager (RVM) on Ubuntu. There you can install ruby2 too.\nhttps://rvm.io/\n", "Q: No network on Ubuntu Server after changing the modem I upgraded my Internet connection, and after changing the Modem my Ubuntu Server's eth0 doesn't come up.\nI looked at /etc/netwrork/interfaces, it looks all normal eth0 is set to auto and dhcp\n# The loopback network interface\nauto lo\niface lo inet loopback\n\n# The primary network interface\nauto eth0\niface eth0 inet dhcp\n\nIn the boot process right after Ubuntu starts to run, the lights for the port to which the cable is connected to stops blinking as if no cable is connected to it.\nAnd that's when Ubuntu is trying to configure \"virtual network devices\".\nIt then tries to configure the network devices a couple of times taking about 2 minutes, then it says \"Booting system without full network configuration\".\ndmesg | grep eth, shows two eth0: link downs, and one eth0: link is not ready.\nWhen I do ifconfig I don't get an IP.\n\nA: Unbelievable but restarting the modem fixed the problem, it seems to me like this modem has issues with DHCP, it almost crashes after making changes to DHCP, but restart fixes the issues.\n", "Q: How to collect laptop hardware information? So I'm entering the business of buying and selling laptops. For me, it's convenient to boot up a laptop in Ubuntu to see some of the hardware still works. The screen, hard drive, wifi, bluetooth, yadda yadda.\nI think this may come across as a software/library shopping question, but I will fire it off anyways.\nSo, I want to go collect hardware information on a per laptop basis and store it somewhere. I can use this to debug or figure out hardware issues after something is already sold. It would also be useful to see which hardware is particularly common or buggy and avoid those. Or provide proper support for them.\nI have been using Linux for a while, so I know of lshw -html and inxi. Is that all I need, or are there any supplementary programs? It would be useful to know the BIOS versions of various laptops too, if I can query that sort of thing. Does lshw report correctly on computers that have poorly supported hardware?\nEdit:\nI should add that I would like additional information that may be available, like how many hours the screen has seen, SMART info on hard drives, or anything else that may be logged. This will vary greatly from laptop to laptop, but some laptops do keep track of useful information. The firmware in Thinkpad batteries keep track of how many hours they've been used, recharged, current capacity, and other jazz like that.\nIt would be very useful for me to have a huge datadump of information like this.\nFor extra stuff, it would be nice to have performance tests on the USB ports, hard drives, graphics card, testing battery life, etc. I don't mind whipping up the tests myself, but if there was a starting point out there, that'd be fairly useful to build on top of. No need reinventing the wheel, afterall.\nEdit 2:\nIn addition to lshw and inxi, it seems like there are other useful tools, like hwinfo and hardinfo. hardinfo doesn't have a command-line only mode, but it can also be used to generate reports. These are good enough to suffice for now. Thanks.\n\nA: This seems to have been discussed before but your needs are a little bit different, I think.\nHowever, take a look at this answer, which contents is placed here for your convenience:\n\nYou may wish to give a try to HardInfo or Phoronics which doesn't\n  indeed do as many things as Sandra does, but it shouldn't as we are\n  talking about Linux Systems.\nTake a look at:\nHardinfo at http://hardinfo.berlios.de/HomePage\nFrom the site: System Profiler and Benchmark HardInfo can gather information about your system's hardware and operating system, perform\n  benchmarks, and generate printable reports either in HTML or in plain\n  text formats. \nI prefer to use Hardinfo, here is my screenshot of a benchmark in\n  action in my system:\n\nPhoronics at http://www.phoronix-test-suite.com/\nFrom the site: The Phoronix Test Suite is the most comprehensive testing and benchmarking platform available that provides an\n  extensible framework for which new tests can be easily added.

If you have an SMTP server (MTA) anywhere already that you can use, choose nullmailer. Otherwise you could go with postfix (requires some work) or courier-mta which comes with sane defaults, too (and is somewhat easier for beginners, IMO).\nThe fixed-width names above are package names on Ubuntu. So apt-get install <packagename> will get you the MTA installed. The main issue seems to be that you configured no MTA and therefore cron cannot send mail. The job itself doesn't indicate error from the log output I can see.\nSide-note: you could also suppress any output from your jobs by appending (to the job line):\n> /dev/null 2>&1\n\n... and even suppress error exit codes with appending (further):\n|| /bin/true\n\n... I wouldn't recommend it, however. Also setting MAILTO in your crontab (see man 5 crontab) is another option here. But it's kinda \"global\" to the respective crontab:\nMAILTO=\"\"\n\n\nWhat cron mails is the output (stdout/stderr, if it finds an MTA that is) of the job it ran. And it does that by default, yes. Also error exit codes (non-zero) will result in the output being mailed.\nHowever, it also needs to be able to run the job, which in all cases requires that the file be executable (chmod a+x ...) or that, in case of a script, you prepend the path to the script interpreter and that in, case of a script, a proper hashbang line exists at the beginning of the file.\n\nA: use this cron line instead\n* * * * * DISPLAY=:0 GSETTINGS_BACKEND=dconf /bin/wallch.sh\ncould also use */2 in the hour column for a background change every two hours (all even hours)\nOfftopic advice: this is not a rule just a form to keep the scripts apart, use /usr/local/bin for you admin scripts. :)\n", "Q: How to change permanently the PATH with Ubuntu 12.04 LTS?

Also, if the other person is using jitsi client, the calls can be encrypted. I tried this today with my friend who had a google account and was using jitsi. The performance was decent. Please try with some one who has a google account but not the jitsi client and let me know. I have not tried the video conference feature yet. \nFor the second question i have no answer as of now :(\n\nA: There is currently no desktop native app for Google Hangouts. As far as I am aware all usage for Google Hangouts is done through a web browser. \n\nA: You may use empathy as your Hangouts client for Google chat :-)\nI'm just using like that. simple n lovely. just Hangout smiley faces are missing which i think you can fix that with plugin (if someone made that)\n\nA: Google offers their own Ubuntu client, it's pretty good.\nhttp://www.google.com/hangouts/\nIt is kind of a Chrome hybrid, in that it does require Chrome to be running, but does create its own Desktop windows.\n\nA: Take a look here Hangouts extension\nIt adds a button to chrome and tray icon.\nGood luck\n\nA: YakYak\nCross platform desktop client for hangouts built in electron\nDownload\n\n\nA: How to install Google Hangout:\n\n*\n\n*Go to the Google+ Hangouts page and click in the Download Plugin button.\n\n\n\n*Then you will see a list containing options with binary files, this page will read your system information and select automatically the best option for you. Click in the Download Link button and save the file in your computer.\n\n\n\n*When the download is complete, open the file (double click over it).\n\n\n\n*It will be open with the software-center, click in the Install button.

Go to http://www.google.com/hangouts/ and click the \"Available for your computer\" link at the bottom. Despite being a Chrome extension, it makes Hangouts live in their own windows outside of the browser.\n\nA: they made a desktop client for hangouts. its still a chrome extension but if you allow running chrome in the background hangouts will run like a standalone hangouts app.\nIt can be tricky because there are two hangouts apps in the chromewebstore.\n\nA: You can try Franz, which is an app based on Electron. It lets you add a Google Hangouts account (and many other popular instant messaging platforms).\n\n", "Q: Can I play the game Don't Starve on Ubuntu? I am new to Ubuntu.

It's my understanding that the history file is updated when the terminal exits.  But sometimes my computer crashes out, and the terminal doesn't exit cleanly, and then I lose those commands from my history which is annoying.  How can I make it flush immediately, so that the entries still go there even if my computer has a meltdown?  At the moment I'm using this workaround, but I feel there should be a better way.  \nI'm using gnome-terminal on Ubuntu 12.10.\n\nA: The simplest, working answer to the question \"How to save terminal history manually?\":\nhistory -a\n\nhistory -a will append your current session history to the content of the history file.\nIt may also be worth to consider switching to zsh, which has setopt inc_append_history (\"save every command before it is executed\").\nAnd this question is relevant as well: Is it possible to make writing to .bash_history immediate?\n\nA: To save bash history manually to a file:\nhistory -w ~/history.txt\nvim ~/history.txt\n\nIt exports the history to a file called history.txt. You can then view it using your favorite editor.\nAnswer copied from http://tech.karbassi.com/2007/01/14/view-and-change-bash-history/\n\nA: The answers in the link that you provided from the Super-Users site shouldn't necessarily be viewed as 'workarounds' to the history command's default behavior. The bash shell has some sane, out of the box, default behavior.\nI would highly recommend reading How can I avoid losing any history lines?  for an explanation of what these modifications to history are doing. Additionally, there are some reasonable concerns to be aware of as to why this is not the default behavior of the history command. \n\n\n*\n\n*performance - Since you are saving every command from every window with history -a, the .bash_history file can grow quite large and require greater resources to load the bash shell. This can result in longer start up times(for your terminal sessions, not overall system startup, per se.).\n\n*organization - (from the above article) \"the history commands of simultaneous interactive shells (for a given user) will be intertwined. Therefore the history is not a guaranteed sequential list of commands as they were executed in a single shell.\" \nIf you are concerned about further securing the bash shell and the .bash_history file through auditing, take a look at this article: How do I log history or \"secure\" bash against history removal?\nOn occasion (e.g. an unstable system, or power failure), I have found the below commands useful.  \nAdd the following lines to your ~/.bashrc file:\nunset HISTFILESIZE\nHISTSIZE=3000\nPROMPT_COMMAND=\"history -a\"\nexport HISTSIZE PROMPT_COMMAND\n\nshopt -s histappend\n\nBe sure to source your .bashrc file using the command source ~/.bashrc\n", "Q: Stick with package version Is there a way to disable per-package updates?

The updated version is in the base sources of Ubuntu, so I can't just remove a PPA.\n\nA: You can always run your updates and select what to install or what not. \nSo when you see an update for Clementine simply deselect the update in the update-manager, and you'll come out fine. \nThe downside is that you'll have to deselect it each time you run your updates. \nThis is the easiest way. \n", "Q: Wired internet isn't working I would really appreciate help on this.\nAlright, so after searching for while on why Ubuntu wasn't connecting to the internet, someone told me that it may be the chip I had.

I use Caps Lock to change keyboard layout since the first year with Linux.\nNow, somewhere in the last year some patch added something so now it waits for ~300ms before changing the layout. And if I hit any key before that time ends it doesn't work. AFAIU it's somehow related to using Meta/Win both as modifier and as key. Is that interval tweakable? I don't use it as a modifier at all.\n\nA: I use Shift + Caps Lock to trigger the keyboard layout switch.\nWhen using both layouts, I very frequently switch back and forth, and the switch seems instantaneous. That is, I never experience a hang (and I'm a fast touch typist - on both layouts).\nMaybe worth considering?\n\nA: Though not a fan of apple, the observation in a SOLVED thread (on apple.com) that switching on the Caps Lock light (or keeping it lit? whatever... ) could be causing a delay might be a pointer into the right direction: the work-around suggested in the thread involves using 3rd-party software to emulate certain key combinations.\nWhat comes to mind as an equivalent in the Linux world is xdotool (see the man page, which has some basic examples). Specifically to your case, you may want to try sth like xdotoolkeyCaps_Lock as used in yet another SOLVED thread (on ubuntuforums.org).\nAccording to my own experience (unless you're willing to really go a level deeper) you'll have to play around with different key combinations and xdotool to find the magic combination which really does work smoothly. But definitely worth giving it a try!\n\nA: cd /usr/share/X11/xkb/symbols\nsudo cp capslock capslock.bak\nsudo sed -i 's#key <CAPS> {\\t\\[\\tISO_Next_Group,\\tCaps_Lock\\t]\\t};#key <CAPS> {        repeat=no, [ ISO_Next_Group, Caps_Lock ] };#' capslock\n\nUpdate:\nYou also have to release the Caps Lock before pressing another key.\nRelated:\nhttps://askubuntu.com/q/264127/20275\n", "Q: Manual intervention required for booting - How do I automate this? I have Ubuntu 12.04 running exclusively on my aspire one 756 netbook, I downloaded the 64bit iso and made my install on a usb-stick.\nFirst issue: it did not boot automatically from that stick, I had to choose the usb efi device manually to boot and install from.  However the installation went fine\nNow the system won't boot normally and I always need to choose the efi part manually to boot.\nThe bios (updated yesterday to v1.09) and has no 'legacy boot' nor a 'secure boot' option to choose from. The grub update with \"boot=efi\" made no changes.\nIs there a solution to automate this?\nthanks in advance\nupdate: i've run boot-repair over it. maybe it helps boot-repair info\n\nA: One part of the answer is from Acer saying 'if you are on BIOS 1.x, stay on 1.x'\nA german Acer forum gave me the advice to do a low-level-format prior to installing the x64 version.\nI have not tested this, as I'm back to 32bit (up and running smooth).\n\nA: Try this, in Ubuntu:\nsudo efibootmgr -o 0,3,4,1\n\nIf that doesn't work, then I have three other suggestions:\n\n\n*\n\n*Run the Ubuntu Boot Repair tool. I'm not 100% positive that it will work in your case, but it might.\n\n*Type sudo mkdir -p /boot/efi/EFI/BOOT; sudo cp /boot/efi/EFI/ubuntu/grubx64.efi /boot/efi/EFI/BOOT/bootx64.efi. This will copy GRUB to a fallback/default EFI boot loader filename that might work.\n\n*Download and install the Debian package version of my rEFInd boot manager, then type sudo mvrefind.sh /boot/efi/EFI/refind /boot/efi/EFI/BOOT. This will put rEFInd in the fallback/default boot loader position. If that doesn't work, try typing sudo mvrefind.sh /boot/efi/EFI/BOOT /boot/efi/EFI/Microsoft/Boot. This last command copies rEFInd to the default location used by the Windows boot loader, which some very badly-written EFIs insist on using.\n\n\nYou can try these in any order you like, although I've listed them in increasing order of complexity.\n", "Q: rtcwake from acpi state s5 I've used rtcwake on my desktop for some time running Precise Pangolin without problems. Recently I came across a thinkpad x230 with an ultradock which I also installed Precise Pangolin on.\nIt works great and for a while rtcwake seemed to work as well. I noticed that it only seemed to support \"off-mode\" when attached to the dock though. Now it no longer seems to support \"off-mode\" and that's my problem. It doesn't wake up no more. I've tried \"mem\" and that works, but I really would like \"off\" to work as well.\nAnyone got any ideas?\n\nA: Seems it was a BIOS issue. Changing various BIOS settings seems to have solved the problem. Likely it was me changing the value of \"Wake on AC\" to disabled which caused the problem in the first case. For future reference the problem seems to have been the value of \"Alarm_irq\" being changed to \"no\" instead of the \"yes\" it should have been, during shutdown or restart.\n", "Q: Ways to run Nautilus with elevated privileges What are the differences between the following ways to run Nautilus with elevated privileges:\na)\nsudo nautilus\n\nb)\ngksu nautilus\n\nc)\ngksudo nautilus\n\nWhich should I use?\n\nA: The difference is that sudo nautilus won't initialise properly:\n\nYou should never use normal sudo to start graphical applications as Root. You should use gksudo (kdesudo on Kubuntu) to run such programs. gksudo sets HOME=~root, and copies .Xauthority to a tmp directory. This prevents files in your home directory becoming owned by Root. (AFAICT, this is all that's special about the environment of the started process with gksudo vs. sudo). \n\nfrom: RootSudo (help.ubuntu)\nIt is advised to always use gksudo\n\nA: Open terminal, And type : ls -l /usr/bin/gksudo\nFrom this result u can see that between gksudo and gksu is same because gksudo is symbolic link to gksu . gksu and gksudo are only frontend for su , like sudo ---> su.The diference is when you type sudo you must insert your user password not root password.I think it's usefull for computer that so many user in it that we dont have to know root password exactly.So it's about security because it's danger if using root. \nSudo is a way better instead using su.We just have to add the user to member group of sudo. Member group of sudo can be root with just \"one password\" . gksu/gksudo is graphical frontend to using su, but the diference is when we use gksu/gksudo it will preserve our desktop settings configuration so \"root\" not change ur desktop setting and crash ur system home. \n\nA: The last two alternatives, because they create a loginshell. Anyways gksudo is just a soft link to gksu :)\nThe first one has a potential problem with inherited environment variables. You might end up writing stuff in your home directory as root.\n", "Q: Where is the documentation for programming OpenGL ES for Ubuntu Touch?

NTFS, FAT or Ext3?\nYou can mount your partition drive automatic so you when you start ubuntu you dont have to connect manually.This is the step. Open  disk utility. \n\nFind out where the location of your drive you want to mount (Dont mount The system (ubuntu system partition) because it's already mount by ubuntu) .Like my drive is on /dev/sda2 and the type is NTFS\n\nOpen terminal and type: \nsudo mkdir /mnt/windows [enter]  You can rename windows whatever you want.it's just example\nsudo chmod 755 /mnt/windows [enter]\nsudo gedit /etc/fstab    [enter]\nand insert new line, like this\n\nSave and restart ur pc. Now you can easy access ur files under /mnt/windows directory. \nYou can doing this to all your drive but remember to using diferent name folder and diferent /dev/sda* . if your drive type is ext4/ext3 just change ntfs to ext4 on your /etc/fstab.

When I turn my computer on a screen comes up asking me for a password. This is not the typical Ubuntu log in screen, but it looks like the Gnome log in. \n\nUsually this gives me a choice of what to log in to: Unity, Gnome, Gnome no effects, etc. \nThis time around I have no choice, it just takes me into the current version of Gnome (don't know to call this the shell or Gnome 3). \nEverything works fine, but the normal Unity session is missing, as are the other Gnome options.\nHow do I get the option to select Unity back?\n\nA: Since lightdm is the default in ubuntu, a different login screen means you installed some other display manager. It seems that you are currently using gdm, so to revert back just input this line in the terminal:\nsudo dpkg-reconfigure gdm\nand choose lightdm as the default display manager.\n", "Q: Is it possible to set Totem as frontend for Xine? The Wikipedia article for Totem player says that \"until version 2.27.1, it could alternatively be configured to use the Xine libraries instead of GStreamer\".\nI like Xine very much, but not its available GUIs (xine-ui, gxine, kaffeine are so awkward that I still prefer to stick with VLC, SMPlayer, Totem or Gnome Player).\nIs it a way to make one of the most used \"players\" - especially Totem, maybe, but the present version 3.4 might not allow it - be used as a fronted for the Xine engine (xine-lib)?\n(Also, is there a new GUI for Xine that I have not mentioned? The others listed here are abandoned.) \n\nA: Totem can no longer be used as a front-end for Xine, and going forward will probably be even more tightly tied to Gstreamer.\nXine is not as popular as it once was (in fact, it's pretty much dead), so finding a \"modern\" GUI for Xine is essentially impossible, unless someone writes a new one. I would suggest sticking with VLC, or Gnome-Mplayer.\nUnfortunately your options, though varied, will not offer much of anything new and exciting, so to speak.\n", "Q: How to synchronize Tomboy notes Since Ubuntu One Tomboy sync is shutting down, what service I could use to synchronize my Tomboy notes between my Android, Windows, and Ubuntu boxes?  Without proper syncing, I have no incentive to keep using it.\n\nA: You can set up Rainy to run on your Ubuntu or Windows machine, and use it as the sync server in your Tomboy and Tomdroid clients. There is more information on Rainy and how to set it up at that link.\n\nA: Personally, I prefer to use Everpad (linux version of Evernote) as it offers greater functionality:\n\n\n*\n\n*Cross platform syncing & editing (unless I'm mistaken, Tomdroid still doesn't offer editing)\n\n*Great Unity integration\n\n*Notes, notebooks, tags, file attachment support\n\n*Massive extensibility through Chrome/Firefox extensions\n\n\nHave a look at Evernote's official site or take a look at the Wikipedia page\nTo install Everpad in Ubuntu (12.04 and later*):\nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:nvbn-rm/ppa\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get install everpad\n\nYou do have to sign up to the service to use it, but it's free (which a paid version available too).\nLog out and in again to get the lens to work.\nIf you use Gnome Shell, there's support available on the git page (see link below).\n\n\n*Different sources say different things: Webupd8 say that 11.10 onwards is supported, but the official Everpad git repository says 12.04 onwards. \n\nA: I think dropbox is a best choice. It's support android,windows,ubuntu etc. Just download here : https://www.dropbox.com/install?os=lnx  , and install. Launch and set ur folder to sync. Normally folder name dropbox in your home directory will sync. Open Tomboy >edit >preferences >Syncronization  and set the folder to folder dropbox so everytime u save note from tomboy it will automatically sync to dropbox.\nNote: im not a marketing of dropbox :D ...\n\nA: I have just started using btsync. It is working quite well! The desktop version requires some configuration of permissions. There is also Android apps: btsync and tomdroid.\nI am quite excited that this has worked for me, and relatively simple to setup, no server required. In the past I have tried a lot of things. I still use Lucid on one of my machines so U1 has been broken a long time for me. Also the security is built into the btsync system so you don't need to worry about securing the server.\nSo for so good, but I only started doing this yesterday so I can't vouch for this working longer term yet.\n\nA: Use grauphel on your ownCloud server to sync tomboy notes between Tomboy, Tomdroid and Conboy.\n\nA: I have an Owncloud server that works well for syncing tomboy notes and files remain under my control on my server. Some web hosting companies will host Owncloud for you and you will get many more features than available through dropbox. Owncloud has its own webdav server so that any application with webdav capabilities will be able to access the files. This uses all open source solutions.  \n\n\n*\n\n*Obtain Owncloud server access.\n\n*Install Owncloud client to access the server.\n\n*Create a folder within your owncloud folder to hold the tomboy *.note files.\n\n*The remaining steps involve moving your tomboy notes to your owncloud folder. I explained this step in more detail here How do I specify the location Tomboy is to use to store the notes?\n", "Q: How to find and download a image file of specific resolution using wget?

I need a KDE plasma desktop widget (for typing quick short notes). But I use unity environment. Is there any way to add KDE widgets in unity environment?

I've been wondering on what are the advantages and disadvantages of WICD\nCan somebody please tell me?\n\nA: You could probably sum this up as:\n\nAdvantages:\n  \n  \n*\n  \n*It replaces Network Manager\n  \n  \n  Disadvantages:\n  \n  \n*\n  \n*It replaces Network Manager\n  \n\nThey both aim to do the same job and they're roughly a drop-in replacement for each other. Some people prefer WICD because of its ncurses command line UI and others prefer to stick with NM because of its default status in most distributions and it does seem to be well maintained and improved.\nThe only times I've ever seen somebody switch from NM is when NM can't or won't do something they need. If you don't need WICD, I wouldn't suggest changing over.\n\nA: One small advantage of WICD over NM is that it gives more information on what's going on. \nI use to have a problem that my wireless couldn't connect; With NM, I only see that NM tries to connect, then it says fail to connect, then automatically reconnect, then fail again, then reconnect, ..., it keeps going that way without me knowing why exactly it failed. With WICD, I can see the connection attempt is stuck at \"Obtaining IP address\". So at least with WICD, if there is a problem, I can see what the problem is.\n", "Q: How do I save a Juju service for later? When I'm finished using a Juju service for a period of time, how do I put it away so that I can bring it up in the same state? \nOr, \nAre Juju services meant to be stateless?\n\nA: I don't think that it is possible to save a juju VM or service. I think it is not designed for this behavior.\nHere are two options, which may help you:\n1.\nIf you need a some specific information, config-files or data which is in you juju VM, you can take a Snapshot of the VM (If you are allowd by you provider). Later you can restart the VM and access the data but you will not have the full environment if you destroyed it.\n2.\nMaybe easier is to create a second environment in your file: ~/.juju/environments.yaml and let the first one running. This way you can use you first environment whenever you want. Set the second environment as default to access it directly with all you juju-commands.\nThe environments.yaml should look like this:\n\njuju: environments\ndefault: env3\nenvironments:\n env1:\n   ...environment settings...\n env2:\n   ...environment settings...\n env3:\n   ...environment settings...\n\n", "Q: On what (main) \"engines\" are based Ubuntu video players?

You don't need to do anything as it's not going to affect your usage of the program.\nIt is also probable that this only happens because you are using LibreOffice from the Document Foundation (built for any Debian system) and not for Ubuntu specifically (and thus having any Ubuntu-specific patches). Ubuntu builds (such as those in the LibreOffice PPA) would have any changes needed to run on Ubuntu already built in.\nBy the way, I would suggest using this PPA or waiting for newer versions to land in the default repos rather than using the \"normal\" builds for the above mentioned reason. LibreOffice 4.0 is included in Ubuntu 13.04, so if you are on 12.04 or 12.10, chances are it will come downstream to you as well in the not-so-far future.\n\nA: There are 4.0.1-rc1 packages in ricotz's LibreOffice Backports PPA https://launchpad.net/~ricotz/+archive/ppa\nIt says, however:\n\nTHIS IS THE STAGING FOR THE OFFICIAL LIBREOFFICE PPA.

From the command-line:\ncd /\nsudo mkdir mendeley\nsudo chown myuser:myuser mendeley\n\nReplace myuser with whatever your username is.  That should create the folder /mendeley which is owned by your current user which you can use, any subdirectories or files in that directory will be owned by that user but should remain unencrypted.  Maybe a better folder name would be unencrypted and add a /unencrypted/mendeley subdirectory in there.\n", "Q: Qt for Ubuntu SDK: Do I need a device or is there a simulator? just wondering if the Ubuntu SDK comes with a simulator like Eclipse for Android or if I need to flash an actual device?

( /home/user/battery-script.sh )\nThen make it executable, in terminal:\n$ chmod +x /home/user/battery-script.sh\n\nNow in terminal:\n$ gksudo gedit /etc/rc.local\n\nNow before the line exit 0 write the path to your script. ( /home/user/battery-script.sh )\nMake sure exit 0 is after everything else, or else it will exit before executing the commands.\nNow just to be sure of when the script is run, you will probably want to add an xmessage command so that a message pops up when it is run.\nxmessage -center \"Battery script run in /etc/rc.local\"\n\nmake sure it's before the exit 0. \nNow, reboot to test to make sure it runs on startup, then you can remove the xmessage line if it is satisfactory.\nIf this does not work for some reason, you can fall back to GNOME's autostart manager.  It involves editing the sudoers file to allow root access to your script without a password.  We will edit the file's permissions and ownership as to not create a security hole. \nFirst, move the entire script into the /bin/ folder:\n$ sudo mv battery-script.sh /bin/\n\nset root ownership and permissions preventing a regular user from inserting malicious code to be run as root:\n$ sudo chown root /bin/battery-script.sh\n$ sudo chgrp root /bin/battery-script.sh\n$ sudo chmod 555 /bin/battery-script.sh\n\nNow that's set, time to edit the sudoers file:\n$ gksudo gedit /etc/sudoers\n\nGo to the bottom and add this line. Replace $USER with your username\n$USER    ALL = NOPASSWD:/bin/battery-script.sh\n\nNow you can run the script without a password when using sudo.\nNext, open Startup Applications, click add.\nPut anything under Name, and under command put:\nsudo /bin/battery-script.sh\n\nThat's it! Your script will run as root when you boot up, you can add a line in the battery-script.sh echo > /home/user/it_works.txt (replace with username) and that file will be created upon the next boot so you can be sure it's working, or as mentioned earlier, you can use xmessage. \n", "Q: Alternatives to or workaround for snd-usb-audio? so I have an HP envy 3040-nr (http://www.amazon.com/HP-15-3040NR-Laptop-Black-Silver/dp/B006PCDJI2), and after problems with usb-audio and searching around I ended having to blacklist snd-usd-audio in my /etc/modprobe.d/alsa-base.conf.

Any program I have running uses 40-50% of my CPU, which is way too much obviously. I'm running TeamSpeak 3, Terminal, and Firefox as we speak, and TS3's CPU% is around 45% steady, something called \"Xorg\" is always between 20% and 50%, changing a lot, and Firefox is switching between as little as 2% up to as high as 40%.

This virtualization cuts down the processing power read by the OS. so Linux will read that a process is using more of the CPU than it really is.\nSecond, Xorg is kind of like a graphics adapter; without it you would not have the Graphical User Interface (GUI) like Unity or KDE. The higher the graphics requirements of a program, the more processing Xorg will need. Xorg will also work as a basic graphic card driver. You may need to reinstall Ubuntu using 12.04 rather than 12.10, because 12.10 may not have any compatible third party graphics card drivers (that's why you will need to cut down the work load of Xorg to fix laggy video issue). 12.10 is fairly new. Companies like ATI and Nvidia do not update the drivers for every version of Linux or Ubuntu that comes out. \nAs far as Firefox goes, I really can't help you.

My idea is to do a nmap scan and grep the listening/open ports but I'm probably over thinking it.\nFinally I'm trying to allow FTP.\nI used this additional rule to allow FTP but it seems I still get blocked\nsudo iptables -A INPUT -p tcp --dport 21 -m state --state NEW,ESTABLISHED -j ACCEPT\n\nA: FTP is a bit odd in that to allow inbound traffic on port 21 and outbound traffic on port 20 :\nsudo iptables -A INPUT -p tcp --dport 21 -j ACCEPT\nsudo iptables -A OUTPUT -p tcp --sport 20 -j ACCEPT\n\nIn addition ftp will use a random higher port. To allow this you need to load the ip_conntrack_ftp module on boot. Uncomment and modify the IPTABLES_MODULES line in the /etc/sysconfig/iptables-config file to read\nIPTABLES_MODULES=\"ip_conntrack_ftp\"\n\nYou will still need a way to save your iptables configuration and restore it when you boot.

You can use rules as simple as \"allow incoming ftp\" instead of needing to understand all of the special flags to make it work.  They will also allow you to set up advanced rules if you need to. \nBoth ufw and gufw create iptables rules behind the scenes. \n", "Q: What is the recommended stable way to update Ubuntu?

I made a mistake of installing software/packages before that were pushed through software center and have lived to regret it. \nI have to admit that I'm not too familiar with this particular source;\n\nHow can I prevent this from happening in the future?\n\nA: Look carefully at Software Sources in System Settings, in \"Other Software\" tab and disable repositories that contain the software keyword that were force installed, AND PLEASE MORE DETAILS.\n", "Q: Ubuntu 12.04 fresh install comes with xorg 1.13 I have an ATI-Radeon HD4500 and because AMD doesn´t yet support the new Xorg Version 1.13 for the Catalyst-Legacy Driver I decided to make a clean Install of Ubuntu 12.04 which I thought should come with Xorg 1.12!\nBut surprisingly after Installation Xorg -version tells me that I have 1.13 installed...\nDoes anybody has an Idea how this is possible?

Does anyone know if it works?\n\nA: Even if it produces sound under Linux, many of the features listed such as \"5.1 surround\" and \"vibration\" are not going to work if the company has not released Linux drivers. \nMost USB speakers and headphones will work under Ubuntu using generic speaker drivers to produce stereo sound.  I was unable to unable to find any reports of users getting these particular headphones to work, or any headphones made by Rosewill for that matter.\nAfter reading a bunch of reviews I recently purchased Plantronics Gamecom headset.  The surround sound doesn't work, but the stereo audio, volume up and down, mute button, and microphone all do.\nWith Ubuntu, the functionality of USB headphones leaves a bit to be desired.  Especially for plugging and unplugging them.  When you plug in headphones, Ubuntu does not automatically shut off analog speakers and turn on the headphones.  Each time you plug or unplug, you need to go into the sound setting and specifically choose your input and output sources.\n", "Q: How can I set up SFTP with chrooted groups?

Either way, it is more than likely grub has selected an older kernel as the default. and you can change this by modifying /boot/grub/grub.cfg.\nI'd first back this up with sudo cp /boot/grub/grub.cfg /boot/grub/grub.cfg.bak.\nFind then the line the default line: sudo vim /boot/grub/grub.cfg +'/set\\ default/'\nChange the number value to which ever line the kernel is on that you wish to default boot from, starting from 0. You can also set this to be one of the options that's in the 'older versions' section by doing what number the submenu is, usually 2(third line) for most systems, and then >, and the 0 based line in that menu. so if I wanted to boot the first kernel in my old versions menu the line would be set default=\"2>0\"\nI hope this helps. Bare in mind though that this file will get overwritten every time update-grub is ran, so every kernel update will require this change.\n", "Q: How do I make a wine application start on another screen? I have two monitors and WoW always starts in the least preferred window. I have tried everything I could to fix this but it just chooses to be difficult. On Gnome-shell and cinnamon, when I press the super key, all the windows shrink down and I can move it to the correct screen from there, but Unity does not appear to have this feature.\nHow can I move a full screen window that covers the top bar, super drag does not work in wine.\n\nA: I'm using a keyboard shortcut to move any window, be it maximized or not, between monitors. This doesn't require Unity, but it does require Compiz (so you can also use it in Xfce if you've set it up to use Compiz for instance).\nTo do this, firstly, install CCSM and Compiz Plugins if they are not already installed:\nsudo apt-get install compizconfig-settings-manager compiz-plugins\n\nThen open CompizConfig Settings Manager, search for the \"Put\" plugin (it's under Window Management) and enable it. Then, click the plugin so we can change some of its settings.\nOn the \"Bindings\" tab, click on \"Disabled\" next to the \"Put to Next Output\" keyboard shortcut, check the \"Enabled\" box and then assign it a key combination that's not already in use. I've used Ctrl + Tab (click on \"Grab key combination\" to set a keyboard shortcut). Then click ok and you're done.\nNow, focus a window and press the keyboard combination you've used above: the window should move to the other workspace. If you only have two monitors, this should be enough, as it moves any window from one monitor to the other. If you have more than 2 monitors, you can assign keyboard shortcuts for \"Viewport Left\" and \"Viewport Right\" and so on, under \"Put to adjacent viewport\".\nMore about this and other multi-monitor tweaks / fixes @ Ubuntu Multi-Monitor Tweaks (Full Screen Flash Fixes, Span Wallpaper Across Monitors, More)\n", "Q: Does bumblebee configure your xserver to use the dedicated GPU? Just wandered if there is a way to use optirun with the desktop environment. \nAnyone know if it works?\nEdit:\nI have been reading a lot about bumblebee and still have not found any conformation on whether or not your desktop environment runs with optirun (using the GPU) by default or not. Or if it even works.\nI do keep coming back to it to try and figure it out, but so far I have no success.\nNote: bumblebee works fine with my machine (Ubuntu 12.04, NVIDIA GT 650M GDDR3 2GB Graphics)\n\nA: Bumblebee has two components:\n\n\n*\n\n*Power Management (PM)\n\n*Enable you to use the dedicated GPU\n\n\nThe PM component puts the Nvidia card in the D3 state to save power when Bumblebee thinks that you do not need the dedicated GPU.\nThe second component (which you are asking about) is accomplished by starting a X server that binds to the Nvidia card. Each client that wants to render something on the Nvidia card needs this X server for rendering. Since this server is headless, you won't see anything until it is drawn to a display. The desktop that you run on the Intel GPU is used for displaying the rendered frames. In order to transfer the frames from the rendering X server to the displaying X server, a bridge such VirtualGL or primus is needed.\nASCII art that shows the architecture when three different applications are running using both primus and virtualgl as transport:\n  |   rendering X server (Nvidia)     |\n   \\================++=============++/\n    ||              ||             ||\nVirtualGL-\\    /--primus       /-primus\n    ||     \\  /     ||        |    ||\n|glxgears|  ||  |glxgears|    |  |java|\n            ||                |\n   /========++================+======\\\n  |     displaying X server (Intel)   |\n\nSo no, you cannot use optirun startx or something to draw your full desktop on the Nvidia card. Remember that the Nvidia GPU is headless, rendering something on the nvidia card and then transporting it back for displaying on the same headless GPU is quite useless. If you have an external monitor, it might be possible (varies between hardware) to render/display everything on that screen (see Bumblebee wiki).\nYou may also be interested in http://wiki.bumblebee-project.org/FAQ\n", "Q: Gaming on Ubuntu touch I am an indie game developer who is interested in targeting Ubuntu and Ubuntu Touch. I have noticed that you support various tools. I am wondering if you support OpenGL and how much tweaking does a game need to have in order to run properly on Ubuntu? I know that you have different layouts(tablet, phone, pc, tv) and I am wondering how would that effect the game development. Finally, my game  runs on several platforms such as OpenGL, Android, HTML5, Flash. Which one of these is the best to target Ubuntu?\n\nA: I am not a developer myself, but I know Ubuntu supports OpenGL, Adobe Flash Player and HTML5. Ubuntu does not support Adobe Shockwave, as Adobe does not bother to create a package for Linux.\nMy opinion would be to go with OpenGL as that usually has good performance with Ubuntu. You probably already know that Flash is limiting, buggy, and has performance problems. I'm not sure about HTML5 as that hasn't gone mainstream yet, but I'm hoping that it will overtake and replace Flash.\nHope this gives you an idea on what to go for.\n", "Q: Update Manager cannot update due to dpkg error...

I thought formatting a drive was enough to get rid of all data.\nI used my usb drive in a computer that is clearly messed up. So when I got home I formatted it, and then did a scan (it's Ubuntu but I have avast installed) to make sure files transferred between my desktop and laptop are clean, and well there wasn't much to scan seeing as I just formatted it, but I understand that apparently you can have hidden files and stuff still?\nThe scan doesn't show anything when I click show hidden files and it also says that its only using 4.1kb; it always says that; I'm guessing that's for something.\nSo Question 1, is it possible that the virus is still there?\nAnd Question 2 if formatting does clean a drive, although it's Linux, would it have infected it, like the way someone can be a carrier of a cold and not be sick.\n\nA: If you told Ubuntu to format the flash drive, and it did indeed format the partition(s), the flash drive will no longer be able to infect a windows computer.\nTechnically, yes, infected files can still physically exist on the drive, but there is no file descriptor pointing to that file, so you will never even be able to read the file, unless you randomly guessed the location of it and used a tool to copy the raw data [like dd].\nIf you want to wipe the flash drive of all its previous files, just fill up the drive, either with a blank file [in command line dd if=/dev/zero of=/PATH/TO/flashdrive/bigfile then delete it after it fills up all the way.  If you're using fat32 you will have to do multiple files as it has a small max filesize] or pick a file and keep copying over and over.\ntl;dr\nDo not worry about it, it is safe.\n\nA: Formating a USB drive is mostly the best way to get rid of viruses. That 4.1 kb is, I think, the MFT (master file table) of your drive. So nothing to worry about.\nShowing hidden files on Ubuntu is Ctrl + h in Nautilus.\nhttp://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/NTFS#Internals\n", "Q: Updates on Ubuntu after changing Desktop Environment I am planning to switch my desktop environment and I just use it as it is, no other software is installed. But now I want to change to a different desktop enviroment, and my question is: will I still get updates or will it be rooting an android phone I will not get any updates. Also will I be able to keep the applications like Firefox and libre office to my new desktop (lxde).\n\nA: Changing your desktop system does not prevent your computer from getting updates.\nYou may no longer see notifications about updates, as they are targeted at displaying on the default desktop system.  You also may find it harder to run graphical programs to perform updates, as they are built for Gnome.\nYou can always use the command line to do updates:\nsudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get upgrade\n\n", "Q: Problems with Touchpad after updating Cairo (still rough translation)\nI have a Sony Vaio vgn-aw180fu with Ubuntu 12.04 Precise Pangolin. Everything was fine, until I opened a terminal to install cairo updates that the Update Center wouldn't let me install stating that those were untrusted packages.\nUpon installing the updates, the screen froze; I waited and nothing happended, so I  forced a shutdown.\nThen I installed Google Earth, which previously the Software Center couldn't [sic] install, and the screen froze again. Again I waited but it didn't change. I forced shutdown once again, and then Ubuntu would not start. From grub I entered to \"repair ubuntu\", and selected \"repair damaged packages\" and could log in again.\nThe laptop touchpad no longer had the normal functions, one being that the pointer moves too fast; this is the least important, and what bothers me most is that the double tap (double click) to open or move windows does not work anymore.\nThis has happened to me before and I had to uninstall and install it all over again. I read that there are many problems with the touchpad for notebooks with Ubuntu. It's a good system that has made me much satisfied and comfortable but the touchpad problems and not knowing how to correct them make it very uncomfortable\nI might try try with another Linux distribution. Greetings.\nOriginal Spanish.\n\nA: [In Spanish below]\nIf yours is simply a configuration problem, here's what you could do:\nFirst, press the [Super] key (the one that usually comes with a Windows logo) and start typing the words System Configuration\n\nClick on the icon and then look for Mouse and touchpad under Hardware. You'll be presented with two tabs, the second of which corresponds to the touchpad settings:\n\nAdjust speed as necessary and make sure \"Activate mouse clicking with the touchpad\" (Actually, I don't know the exact phrase in English, but it must be something like that).\n\n\n\n*\n\n*Oprimí la tecla [Súper] (la tecla de Windows) y comenzá a escribir la palabra \"Configuración\".\n\n*Hacé clic en el icono de Configuración del sistema. Eso abrirá el panel de configuraciones.\n\n*Seleccioná Ratón y touchpad bajo el lema \"Hardware\".\n\n*Cambiate a la pestaña Touchpad del programa de configuración de ratón y touchpad, y ajustá la \"Velocidad\" hasta que esté a tu gusto. Asegurate que está seleccionada la opción \"Activar pulsaciones del ratón con el touchpad\".\nSuerte.\n", "Q: How to disable Steam check autostarting on every user login? I moved Steam folder to another partition that's not mounted at startup using a symlink: How can I move Steam's download folder?\nNow after every login it thinks it's not yet installed. I checked the package files and there are no XDG autostart. Any suggestion how it even gets launched?\nNothing in /etc/xdg/autostart, ~/.config/autostart and in systemsettings.\nSteam->Settings->Interface->Run Steam when my computer starts not checked.\n\nP.S. I'm on KDE and I don't want to automount the partition.\n\nA: Found it in /var/lib/update-notifier/user.d/steam-install-notify. \nNotice: it doesn't belong to any package.\n\nA: You're trying to keep Steam from starting when a user logs into the computer? I did that on my machine by opening Steam's settings and unchecking the startup option (Steam->Settings->Interface->Run Steam when my computer starts), although I hadn't moved it like you did and I don't use KDE.\n", "Q: Can't get Mac to detect installation media Note: I am following these instructions: Dual Boot OS Ubuntu -OMG Ubuntu. \nSo, for the past few days I've been trying to install Ubuntu on my Mac OSX because I would really like that extra option of using Ubuntu instead of Apple's OS.\nEasy enough, right? Well, I first tried installing via a usb but that didn't work (it kept saying my USB was unreadable) so I decided I would use one of my blank DVD-RWs. I downloaded the Ubuntu file and inserted my blank DVD-RW and it just kept spinning until it was ejected by my Mac. It's not the hardware because it is accepting video DVDs, it just plain won't accept it.\nI decided burning the .iso file from my PC would work, after burning it on my PC I inserted it into my Mac, but my Mac still couldn't read the DVD. What am I doing wrong? My Mac's processor is x64.\n\nA: I figured it out by taking the img file I created, transferring it to my PC, and burning that img to a blank DVD-R. For some reason, Mac then was able to read the DVD. \n", "Q: How to make sure that my Nvidia graphics card drive was updated? I have installed Ubuntu recently but I coulnd't use the driver which I downloaded from Nvidia's official page and I am not sure it would be better if I was able to install it. I would like to ask how can I make sure my graphics card driver was updated somewhat by Ubuntu  via Internet..\nmy card is Nvidia GeForce 210M \nThanks\n\nA: You can update with the following commands\nsudo apt-add-repository ppa:ubuntu-x-swat/x-updates\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get install nvidia-current\n\n\nYou can verify your install by pressing the super key and typing \nnvidia x server settings\n\nOpen that\n", "Q: Version of Qt Creator in Ubuntu Touch SDK I have followed the instructions on go mobile to set up for Ubuntu Touch Development and I have a question about the Qt Creator. \nIn the description of the SDK on http://developer.ubuntu.com/2013/02/releasing-the-ubuntu-touch-developer-preview-and-sdk-alpha/, it says they are using Qt Creator 2.7. After following the instructions on Go Mobile, I ran Qt Creator and checked the version. It says 2.6.82. However, when checking in the Ubuntu Software Center it says that I have Qt Creator 2.7 installed. \nDo I have both installed and I am just running the wrong thing? Or is something displaying the wrong version?\nIt's worth noting that I was able to follow the instructions for developing the CurrencyConverter and it worked ok. I just want to know if I am really supposed to be running 2.7?\n\nA: I'm not sure why that is. I am getting the same version number, but I know this is the right version of Qt Creator, because I had the SDK preview installed, and once they released the SDK alpha, Qt Creator recieved updates and now has the Welcome tab with the Ubuntu symbol. So no, you don't have two versions installed, that one is the right one, as you can tell by the Ubuntu symbol.\n\n\nA: Qt Creator 2.7 is not released yet.\nIt is in the beta phase.\nThat is why you see 2.6.82 as the version number.\n", "Q: Extending postgresql code In postgresql source code there is a file called postgres.c precisely in /src/backend/tcop/.

Any other combination of tools that can show the dependencies visually works too.\n\nA: Maybe not so \"graphical\" but if you prefer not installing any extra packages you can run\napt-cache rdepends <package>\n\nTake a look also to depends option.\nYou also have:\n\n*\n\n*apt rdepends <package>\n\n*Use this script, apt-rdepends-tree <package>\n\n*apt-rdepends <package> or as debtree apt-rdepends --dotty package | springgraph > dependencies.png\n\nA: debtree\nAccording to the application's website, the debtree package provides \"package dependency graphs on steroids\".\nNote: This is also very useful when planning software upgrades. This application is able to graph dependencies against packages which have not yet been installed on your system. This will read from the sources.list file (usually located at /etc/apt/sources.list) and it will perform a live query using that list.\nThe following diagram is an example of running debtree against the package dpkg. Here is a map of its dependencies:\n\nTo install debtree from the command line(Ctrl+Alt+t) enter the following command:\nsudo apt-get install debtree\n\nUsage\n\n*\n\n*Create a .dot file (a directed graph drawing - see the man dot manpage):\n  debtree --with-suggests <package> >out.dot\n\n\n\n*Create a graph (PNG) from a .dot file:\n  dot -T png -o out.png out.dot\n\n\n\n*Create a graph (Postscript) and view it using Okular:\n  debtree <package> | dot -Tps | okular - &\n\nBe aware that when running this application against larger packages (e.g. gedit), the images can quickly become unwieldy and illegible.\nNote that apt-rdepends can also be used in a similar manner, but piping output into a graphic is a bit more convoluted, in my opinion.\nSee also:\nUbuntu debtree man page\n\nA: The command-line tool Apitude is a great tool for looking at dependencies. no fancy graphs, but it does give you a nice hierarchic representation of dependencies for a specific package.\n", "Q: How to text to speech (pdf, docx) documents in lubuntu 12.10 Hello I want text to speech application that works with PDF and other files.

Note, that DELL OPTIPLEX 755 does NOT have PS/2 ports.\nHope this helps anyone having the same problem.\n\nA: Yes, I was experiencing the same thing in 13.10.

I shut down the computer instead of booting, and disabled optimus again in the bios (I had enabled it again in attempts to fix the system). When I rebooted I noticed:\n1) Remote login was back\n2) The Mouse cursor was responsive again\n3) Unity 3d is up and running\n4) Display doesn't crash anymore when accessing it from gnome control center.\nIt's really odd, could updating grub have fixed the problem or could Ubuntu have randomly clicked into place after a few reboots?\n", "Q: Nexus 7 installer gets stuck on 'Erasing Boot Partition\" help what to do next? I have tried installing the Ubuntu Touch with the Nexus 7 Ubuntu Core installer on Ubuntu 12.10 64bit in a VMWare virtual machine.\nIt looks like its stuck on Erasing boot partition.\nI have read elsewhere that someone else had this problem:\nNexus 7 installer gets stuck on 'Erasing Boot Partition\"\nBut what I dont know is, can I disconnect my Nexus 7 and reboot it, or will it not be able to boot into the Android Fastboot recovery screen anymore?\nAlso is it safe right now to cancel the Ubuntu Touch installer and try again or try the manual steps?\nJust want to know whats safe to do and how to fix my problem. :)\nAny help would be greatly appreciated.\nAlso is this the wrong guide?\nhttps://wiki.ubuntu.com/Nexus7/Installation\nOkay so I want this guide I think:\nhttps://wiki.ubuntu.com/Touch/Install\nIs it safe to cancel the first one and just start the second one in the current state my device is in?\nIts still powered on and showing the fastboot android logo / menu?\n\nA: Please don't reboot/power cycle your device just yet, as I'm not sure what else the installer did to your Nexus 7 filesystem. \nIf it didn't erase or otherwise change your bootloader or anything else, then it should be safe to reboot or power cycle the device. You'll just be stuck in a boot-loop at the Google logo. It's fine, just read on.\nObviously you won't be able to boot into the OS, but you'll be able to boot into the bootloader and do some repairs from there.\nAfterwards you can even flash (or re-flash) a kernel to restore the boot partition (from either Fastboot or your installed custom recovery) and boot normally, assuming you have a functional Android ROM flashed into the device, that works in conjunction with the kernel.\n\nA: I posted on XDA and someone confirmed there that Boot Partition is fine, but bootloader is not.\nTurns out that it only crashed erasing the boot partition which is awesome sauce.\nSo everything is fine.\nI was using the wrong installer anyway and Ubuntu Touch worked fine.\nJust a heads up to anyone else who tries to install Ubuntu Desktop onto there Nexus 7 if it freezes while saying erasing boot partition, just cancel and then reflash what ever you want to get back to normal. fastboot will work fine still.\nHowever, interestingly enough, I disconnected and re-connected it to windows and tried to run flash-all and it failed.\nSo... if the bootloader was fked at that point but still running in memory I wouldnt have been able to push a new one anyway. I had to reboot the device before I could run flash-all again.... :(\nIm sure theres probably a way but yeah, if you find yourself in that situation, dont power down and think carefully before you act.\nGlad it was just the partition.\nP.S.

I have installed KDE in full mode using apt-get install with no error but no further effects occurred. I don't know how to use my installation, start in KDE mode and switch between unity and KDE.\n\nA: Installing KDE\nTo install KDE (which it sounds like you may have already done), you install one of the following packages:\n\n\n*\n\n*kde-plasma-desktop\nThis will only install a minimal core of KDE apps and utilities.  Good if you want to use KDE but don't need all the applications and utilities that come with it.\n\n*kde-full\nThis will install a more full range of KDE applications and utilities.\nIf you have other desktop environments installed this will cause you to double-up on a fair few apps (ie, have both the Gnome and KDE equivalent installed).  This is not necessarily a bad thing as it gives choice and lets you (if you want) use anything a native KDE user would use.\n\n*kubuntu-desktop\nThis installs the full Kubuntu desktop which includes the full KDE suite, plus all of Ubuntu's \"Kubuntu\" look and feel, including the splash screens and greeters.  It also installs additional applications that Kubuntu normally installs, like Kontact and Konversation.\nThis is not usually recommended if you also have other desktop environments installed, because it changes the splash screen and greeter to Kubuntu.\nSelecting KDE when logging in\n\n\n*\n\n*Before you enter your password upon log-in, you need to open up the drop-down that says \"Ubuntu\" (which will make you use Gnome/Compiz/Unity, Ubuntu's default) and change it to KDE.\n\n\nA: Hi when you are at the login screen there you can choose wich desktop you want to use like in the screenshot here \n", "Q: Wubi for Windows 7 on Sony Vaio is not Working I have installed Ubuntu using Wubi on my Windows 7 machine (Sony Vaio).

So I installed Eclipse and I cant seem to get the py file I select to open in the Eclipse IDE ... attempting to install py dev to fix this\n\nA: Eclipse doesn't come by default with a python-editing environment.\nYou probably want to install the PyDev addon. See the link for how to get it via the eclipse addon manager - it isn't available through the Ubuntu repositories.\nEDIT: Re-reading the question, I may have misunderstood. I'm not clear if the question is:\n\n\n*\n\n*How to associate .py files to be opened with eclipse rather than gedit/gvim?\n\n*Why eclipse starts an external editor when you try and open a python file with it? (because it has no python editor, see above)\n\n*Why a python file doesn't run when clicked in the file browser?

If you have another operating system or another computer to compare against you might be able to narrow down if its Ubuntu or your router/modem.\n\nA: Try using IDM (Internet Download Manager).\n\n\n*\n\n*If download speed is still slow, it could indicate a problem with your network configuration OR a problem with your internet connection.\n\n*If IDM is not compatible with Ubuntu, try downloading and installing \"Wine\" (to run Windows apps) and try again.\n\n", "Q: How to change the default user name from ubuntu to something else on EC2 AMI How can I create a new Ubuntu AMI so that when a new instance is created the SSH credentials are copied under a different user than ubuntu (e.g. /home/administrator/.ssh/)?\nIn short, I need to be able to use username administrator instead of ubuntu.\n\nA: You can use the EC2 user data to do so.

Now I realize I am not getting any sound from either Ubuntu or Windows 8.\nPlease help me.\n\nA: Ok. This was a false alarm. It turns out that the Beats Audio software on my computer was not working in Ubuntu since there is no Ubuntu version. Hence, when I updated Ubuntu, the local sound card activated and was able to provide me with sound.\nAs for Windows, the Beats Audio software was installed, but not running and since it controls the sound, the sound card reported to work properly, but there was no sound.\nSolution to this problem: If you installed Ubuntu and you don't get sound, \"the problem with Ubuntu might be that you are using 3.2 kernel (i.e. 12.04 or 12.04.1). You can upgrade to 12.10 or 12.04.2.\" as Soroosh129 pointed out above.\nFor Windows, check to see whether there is a third party application that controls your sound (in my case, it is Beats Audio), and configure it properly.\nThanks to you all for helping out.\n", "Q: Weird BIND9 Behavior This problem has been bothering me for 2 days and hope you guys can give me some advice.\nI try to set up outlook.com as my mail service.

Any other advice?\n\nA: You should definitely go with 64 bit, as long you are not going to use any specific 32 bit applications (maybe some old games and so).\nCause it is server - you can install something light (like XFCE xubuntu, or LXDE lubuntu). They are pretty light and will still give you access to rest of the apps from repositories.\n", "Q: Removing and re-installing texlive 2012 I have a problem with texlive.

This can be caused because you need to tell phpmyadmin the name of the tables to use their features. That can be done editing /etc/phpmyadmin/config.inc.php on this lines:\n$cfg['Servers'][$i]['pmadb'] = 'phpmyadmin';\n$cfg['Servers'][$i]['bookmarktable'] = 'pma__bookmark';\n$cfg['Servers'][$i]['relation'] = 'pma__relation';\n$cfg['Servers'][$i]['table_info'] = 'pma__table_info';\n$cfg['Servers'][$i]['table_coords'] = 'pma__table_coords';\n$cfg['Servers'][$i]['pdf_pages'] = 'pma__pdf_pages';\n$cfg['Servers'][$i]['column_info'] = 'pma__column_info';\n$cfg['Servers'][$i]['history'] = 'pma__history';\n$cfg['Servers'][$i]['table_uiprefs'] = 'pma__table_uiprefs';\n$cfg['Servers'][$i]['tracking'] = 'pma__tracking';\n$cfg['Servers'][$i]['designer_coords'] = 'pma__designer_coords';\n$cfg['Servers'][$i]['userconfig'] = 'pma__userconfig';\n$cfg['Servers'][$i]['recent'] = 'pma__recent';\n\nNote the double underscore __.\n\nA: I also had to change all the tables name in /etc/phpmyadmin/config.inc.php with double underscores ex.  \n$cfg['Servers'][$i]['bookmarktable'] = 'pma__bookmark'; \n\nbecause that was the table created after create_tables.sql execution.\n\nA: This Helped Me:\n\n\n*\n\n*sudo vim /etc/phpmyadmin/config.inc.php\n\n*Add the following lines with the other $cfg['Servers'][$i]:\n$cfg['Servers'][$i]['central_columns'] = 'pma__central_columns';\n$cfg['Servers'][$i]['favorite']         = 'pma__favorite';\n$cfg['Servers'][$i]['navigationhiding'] = 'pma__navigationhiding';\n$cfg['Servers'][$i]['recent']           = 'pma__recent';\n$cfg['Servers'][$i]['savedsearches']    = 'pma__savedsearches';\n$cfg['Servers'][$i]['table_uiprefs']    = 'pma__table_uiprefs';\n$cfg['Servers'][$i]['tracking']         = 'pma__tracking';\n$cfg['Servers'][$i]['userconfig']       = 'pma__userconfig';\n$cfg['Servers'][$i]['usergroups']       = 'pma__usergroups';\n$cfg['Servers'][$i]['tracking']         = 'pma__users';\n\n*Now try to login to localhost/phpmyadmin.

I mean for each of the text file I edit there is always the backup files with them. Is there any solution? Or do I have to access the files from some folder?\n\nA: Create a file named .hidden in the desktop. Open it with a text editor and add the names of files you want to hide.\nIf there are numerous files you want to hide, open the terminal, change cd to desktop, and run the following command to hide all files ending with ~  :\nfor i in *~; do echo \"$i\"; done > .hidden\n\nNote: I don't have an XFCE system so i haven't tested it out.\n", "Q: How to start two Ubuntu applications in one go? Lets suppose that there are two binary files, e.g. XXX and YYY, at destination /usr/bin/. I want to start them at once, always! In other words, when I type the name of either of those in unity, I want to make both of them start. How could I change the corresponding files at destination /home/username/.local/applications/ to do so? I tried this /usr/bin/XXX;/usr/bin/YYY; on terminal but it doesn't seem to work.\n\nA: As I understand you need to edit your .desktop file. Add this line next to Exec:\nsh -c \"/usr/bin/XXX  & /usr/bin/YYY\"\nThe -c flag tells to the shell that it has to read the  commands from string, instead of from the standard input. \n\nIf you use only /usr/bin/XXX  & /usr/bin/YYY it won't work. Just to add the reason why & doesn't work in a launcher, it's because & is a feature of the shell, and the launcher isn't a shell, its a much simpler environment for running commands. \n\nA: /usr/bin/app_first & \n/usr/bin/app_second\n\nUsing '&' you are sending process into background. \n\nA: You should use\n/usr/bin/XXX && /usr/bin/YYY;\n\nNote the use of && (no need to use & to run something in the background).\n\nA: You will need to add the command names XXX and YYY into a directory at an earlier point in the search path.  For both this command named file will run the original XXX and YYY by using the full path names /usr/bin/XXX and /usr/bin/YYY.  This is to prevent the script from re-running itself forever in a loop (or until your computer runs out of memory).  An alternative to this is replacing the commands with your script and moving the original commands to another path like /usr/local/bin.\nThis script needs to run both /usr/bin/XXX and /usr/bin/YYY in the background so they are running at the same time.  The classic way to do this is:\n/usr/bin/XXX &\n/usr/bin/YYY\n\nAs described by bluszcz above.  You might also want to put the \" &\" on the 2nd command as well.  An alternative way to more quietly put these commands in the background is with screen, which could be coded in the script like this:\nscreen -dmS XXX /usr/bin/XXX\nscreen -dmS YYY /usr/bin/YYY\n\nThat can have the advantage in cases where you might want to go see the progress of the commands without doing logging, bu using screen to attach to the sessions that creates.\n", "Q: Invalid host for SSH forwarding: ssh : Could not resolve hostname Actually trying to insatll MaaS server with ubuntu 12.04 and JuJu.

I got a Macbook Pro 9,1 (mid 2012) and plan on finally switching from MacOS X as main system and Windows for games, to Ubuntu as main one and MacOS X just for firmware updates.\nHow would I do that, while still being able to use the full disk encryption from the Ubuntu installer (so easy). because last time I tried, w/ my MacOS X volume fully encrypted, w/ recovery, Ubuntu would only let me use fde, if I had erased the whole disk again and started over.\nMacOS X full disk encryption isn't really needed, if I plan on just keeping it around for updates to the hardware.\nOr would you just kill MacOS X altogether? And boot it from an external hd, if there's a hardware update available, or I wanna edit/disable my firmware password.\n\nA: I'm not sure about the graphics question - Might want to split this up into 2 questions.\nOn the encryption front, ubuntu does the encryption on a partition basis, not on the entire disk - I set up a recent laptop I got with an encrypted Ubuntu and a non-encrypted windows 7 install, and it worked fine.   \nI'm not sure whether the MacOS encryption is really 'full-disk' or just partition based - but I'm quite confident that if unencrypted MacOS is OK, you should be able to have encrypted Ubuntu and non-encrypted MacOS on the same disk.\nHowever, if you are really keeping MacOS around just for the firmware updates, might want to look into booting from a USB key or DVD when you need the updates...\n", "Q: Grub prompts for which drives to install on after apt-get upgrade I have a little diffuse question. I recently wanted to upgrade my nginx installation on one of my servers running ubuntu 12.04. I read somewhere that this should be done by running apt-get upgrade nginx -f - however that seems to be wrong, because my server started to upgrade A LOT of packages - including grub - and this is what my question is about. It prompted me for telling which device or partition to install grub to, and it something about installing it to all if unsure. I ended up aborting the installation, and then it told me that my server might not boot correctly if I restarted it, because I didn't specify the devices or something. \nAs you might have expected I have no knowledge about grub, and my question is therefor: \nIs there currently something wrong after I aborted the apt-get upgrade?

This holds for su (or sudo) but also for the path to bash in your command. You are doing it right with screen.\nJust tested the following and it works nicely.

Of course tmux is as good as screen when you simply want to run some program/script not originally written as daemon in background. If you intend to interact with the terminal multiplexer, however, I warmly recommend tmux.\n\nA: Try sudo -u username instead of su - username\n", "Q: How do I open a text file in my terminal? There is a file named RESULTS.txt and I want to open this file in my terminal. (I mean I want to see the file contents be displayed in the terminal and not in some text editor) \nHow do I do that ?\n\nA: Another option:\ntail -f your_file\n\nIt will show you the last ten lines of your_file. If a process appends something to this file, you see it on your terminal. man tail gives you more on tail.\nIt's useful to see what happens with a server when you use this command on a log file.\nPress Ctrl-C to quit when you are done viewing.\n\nA: There are a lot of alternatives for doing that:\nSome of these programs have a lot of parameters, so check that out with --help after the command..\n\n\n*\n\n*cat filename prints the whole file at once\n\n*more/less filename similar behaviour for see the file in parts\n\n*tail filename start reading from the tail of the file\n\n*grep text filename for filtering results\n\n\nHope that some of this works for you..\n\nA: Another alternative is vim. \nvim RESULTS.txt\n\nOnce you opened a file with vim you can insert text by typing i, for instance. If you want to save your file use :w (write) or :q (quit) or :wq (for write and quit) or :q! (quit and do not save). Sometimes you need to hit the ESC key to be able to type the commands.\nVim requires some learning, but is widely used and it is very versatile.\nCheck the community help wiki: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/VimHowto\n\nVim is an advanced text editor that provides the power of the de-facto\n  Unix editor 'Vi' with a more complete feature set. Vim is often called\n  a \"programmer's editor,\" and is so useful for programming that many\n  consider it an entire IDE. It's not just for programmers, though. Vim\n  is perfect for all kinds of text editing, from composing email to\n  editing configuration files.\n\n\nA: For short files:\ncat <path/your_file>\n\ndirectly shows a text file in the terminal.\nFor longer files:\nless <path/your_file>\n\nlets you scroll and search (/ text to search Enter) in the file; press q to exit.\ne.g.\ncat /home/john/RESULTS.txt\nless /home/john/RESULTS.txt\n\n\nA: With a terminal text editor: nano /path/to/file/RESULTS.txt\n\nA: As we seem to be listing all available alternatives of displaying any text file in the terminal, it would be quite fun to introduce pv as technically one valid (but unusual) method, although I would normally use cat instead for most things. \nIt is in the repositories and so can be installed with sudo apt-get install pv if you don't have it already.\nAs the man page notes, pv is very often used to \n\nmonitor the progress of data through a pipe...pv will copy each supplied FILE in turn to  standard  output  (-  means standard  input),  or  if no FILEs are specified just standard input is copied. This is the same behaviour as cat(1).\n\nWith pv you can literally print the file to the screen, and choose the rate (-L) at which it appears. The example below uses a high rate (300), but if you choose a low rate such as -L 50, it will appear as if the computer is typing out the file for you. \npv /etc/apt/sources.list -qL 300\n\nNeedless to say you can increase the rate further (-L 8000), and the command becomes very similar to cat, with the output appearing instantaneously. \nFor more information see man pv or the Ubuntu manpages online.\n\nA: all those are best ways and there is one more way to do this & that’s with head command.\nhead -n -1 filename.txt\n\nand\nhead -n -0 filename.txt\n\nboth will give you the same input.\nHead command Explanation:\nGenerally head command used to print the starting lines of the any text file.we can view the text file with \nhead filename.txt\n\nThat will prints the 1st 10 lines of the above text file.\nIf you want to specific on the number of lines which are to be view then you can use head as\nhead -n 20 filename.txt\n\nThen in the above text file first 20 lines will be viewed.\nIf you want to view whole file data with head means then then we can get it by\nhead -n -0 filename.txt\n\nHope that above explanation will give you some idea on usage of head.\n\nA: If the file is rather long, you might want to use \nless RESULTS.txt\n\nso that you can navigate through it with directional keys.\n\nA: Another option is:\ntail -n 30 result.txt\n\nto print out the last 30 lines of a large file named result.txt.\n\nA: If you just want to read the file content, go in the file directory and type \nless RESULTS.txt\n\nIf you want to read and edit the text file, from the same directory type\nnano RESULTS.txt\n\nThe -w switch in the nano command can be inserted before the file name to prevent wrapping of long lines.\n\nA: Lots of good options provided here already, but another option if you need to edit is emacs:\nemacs -nw RESULTS.txt\n\nmight not need the -nw, depending. You may also have to apt-get install emacs23 or apt-get install emacs24, or if you don't have X or don't want related X dependencies, apt-get install emacs23-nox or apt-get install emacs24-nox.\nAnd in addition to cat and less as mentioned elsewhere, there is more. More is less, because you see a page at a time and can't scroll via the command itself, but you can scroll with the terminal window, if you have a scrolling terminal window:\nmore RESULTS.txt\n\nIf you're in bash, you have something similar to cat by doing:\nwhile IFS= read a;do echo \"$a\";done<RESULTS.txt\n\n\nA: If you need to edit the content of the file i commonly use nano. \nnano filename\n\n\nA: The shell programm sed also has an option to print out the contents of a file.\nsed -n p RESULTS.txt\n\nSo sed walks through every line and prints it to the terminal. But  sed also has editing capabilities. For instance if you want to replace each comma with a dot you can write:\nsed 's/,/./g' RESULTS.txt\n\n\nA: Why not.\nYou can also use\nmost RESULTS.txt\n\nIt's almost the same as less, but it also supports horizontal scrolling if the file contains long lines - which is really handy.\nmost is not installed by default, so to use it, you have to first\nsudo apt install most\n\n\nA: Another more exotic answer is to use grep:\ngrep . RESULTS.txt\n\nThe grep command searches for a every character in the file and prints it out. So basically the complete file is printed out.\n\nA: or just\n\nvi YourFile\n\nuse hjkl buttons to move line left/down/up/right, Esc then :q to quit\nand you can PageUp/PageDown\nyou can also edit it here in a stright way\nhere you'll find more link\n", "Q: Is there a way to save username and password for print authentication? I saw this this question and followed its answer, but the problem persists for me. Once I send a document to print, this dialog box (in figure) opens up and shows \"Held for authentication\". Then I right-click and enter my username and password and then the pdf is sent to the network printer. \nIs there a way to store my username and password? The 'Remember password' option does not work. I do not want to remove authentication (can't see how the network printer will identify me if I am not authenticated, as the network is based on Windows), I just want to save my username and password into some appropriate file so that I do not have to key in every time.\n\nA: that's a bug, look at bugs.launchpad\non another page they write:\n\nIf I don't type anything, the window's form says that I will send my username only (and a blank password) but wireshark shows that it is instead sending the correct username and password (which I entered into the printers folder, but which is hidden).\n\nmaybe it works for you\n\nA: This might work. Although you are not sharing a printer on your computer the fact that you install Samba and connect to a share on your network means you might get authentication via Samba. I haven't tried it personally but its worth a shot.\nhttps://help.ubuntu.com/12.04/serverguide/samba-printserver.html\n", "Q: Prevent xsession-errors I am having an issues with my ~/.xsession-errors file filling up my entire drive (128G) in a couple of days. Infact, once it was in a few hours. I run this machine as a server, so it runs for days with out reboot.\nI have read some solutions about how to remove the file via cron, or redirect it to /dev/null.

Also, if anyone could explain what this file is, and why it has so many errors, I would appreciate it. Does it have to do with my remote sessions vnc/ssh.\nUPDATE: It seems to go up in size every time I remote VNC in using \"Desktop Sharing\".\n\nA: This can be a useful tool for debugging certain applications but in some cases (and most of KDE is a prime example) you end up with way too much stuff just sitting in there. \nDeleting (or otherwise abusing) the file will not be a permanent solution because the sessions are set to recreate this file on login. However you have a few options to deal with it.\nFor the sadist: break all the things!\nYou can break that behaviour simply by running sudoedit /etc/X11/Xsession and looking for the section that squawks on about ERRFILE. Obviously make a backup first, but I would say you can comment (prepend each line with a #) or remove all the following code:\nERRFILE=$HOME/.xsession-errors\n\n# attempt to create an error file; abort if we cannot\nif (umask 077 && touch \"$ERRFILE\") 2> /dev/null && [ -w \"$ERRFILE\" ] &&\n  [ ! -L \"$ERRFILE\" ]; then\n  chmod 600 \"$ERRFILE\"\nelif ERRFILE=$(tempfile 2> /dev/null); then\n  if ! ln -sf \"$ERRFILE\" \"${TMPDIR:=/tmp}/xsession-$USER\"; then\n    message \"warning: unable to symlink \\\"$TMPDIR/xsession-$USER\\\" to\" \\\n             \"\\\"$ERRFILE\\\"; look for session log/errors in\" \\\n             \"\\\"$TMPDIR/xsession-$USER\\\".\"\n  fi\nelse\n  errormsg \"unable to create X session log/error file; aborting.\"\nfi\n\n# truncate ERRFILE if it is too big to avoid disk usage DoS\nif [ \"`stat -c%s \\\"$ERRFILE\\\"`\" -gt 500000 ]; then\n  T=`mktemp -p \"$HOME\"`\n  tail -c 500000 \"$ERRFILE\" > \"$T\" && mv -f \"$T\" \"$ERRFILE\" || rm -f \"$T\"\nfi\n\nexec >>\"$ERRFILE\" 2>&1\n\necho \"$PROGNAME: X session started for $LOGNAME at $(date)\"\n\nFor the long-login user: cron\nI stay logged into my desktop for weeks at a time and if something blows up, chances are I'll only need the debug for a couple of hours, if at all. So I ran crontab -e and created a line like this:\n0 * * * * bash -c \">/.xsession-errors\"\n\nThat just gives the file an hourly colonic.\nFor the masochist: fix all the bugs!\nYou have to remember that .xsession-error output is there to indicate a bug or something behaving in a way that it should not. This is not always true (glares at KDE) but in your case with your VNC client, this may indicate that something is going wrong.\nIf you have a look at the errors you might be able to change your application settings to avoid the error, or failing that, report the error (along with some of the sample messages) to the author of the software.\nIf it is just spam (Eg: \"connecting to server\") report that as a bug to the author too.

This will generate a makefile in the ext/openssl directory.  Simply make && sudo make install it to build the ruby openssl extension, and install the .so into the appropriate location.\nDitto ext/readline for readline support.\nThen you should be able to make ruby properly.\nEdit: in case I wasn't clear enough:\npushd ext/openssl\nruby extconf.rb\nmake && sudo make install\npopd\n\npushd ext/readline\nruby extconf.rb\nmake && sudo make install\npopd\n\nmake\nsudo make install\n\n\nA: When installing ruby 2.0, it is possible that rubygems 2.0 installation did not complete ok, because of openssl.

Might be a better way to fix that path without reinstalling, but this should do it.\n", "Q: How to delete \"blank links\"/\"dead links\" from Dash search? After removing the old version of Netbeans and installing the new version, I've being getting the problem. Looks like the Netbeans uninstaller removed everything related with it, except the link/shortcut, and now after I've installed the new version I always get two results in the Dash when I look for Netbeans (it also happens when I'm looking for it with the Applications Lens).\nSo, I'd like to know how to remove the \"blank link\" (that takes me nowhere when I click it).\nHere is a printscreen/screenshot of the problem:\n\n(Just click on it for the full resolution version)\nThanks.\n\nA: You can use Main Menu (alacarte).

But could not understand the below things.\nScenario:\nI have developed an application and packaged it. And its name is MyApp.deb. The binary package name is MyApp .The application is installed in the path /opt/myapplication/bin/MyApp. \nRequirement:\n\n\n*\n\n*When my application crashes, I want to be able to collect core dump.\n\n*On each subsequent crash, it has to create a new crash, but not overwriting the existing one. Something like auto renaming with the current time stamp, etc would help me.\n\n*When I install my application on a customer machine, my installer must not modify his system wide parameters. Say for example, I must not change the pattern of his core file generation, because the user/customer might hate my application as I would change his system parameters without his consent.\n\n*I am ok with the path of core file generation. Either current directory or /var/crash\nThings that I have explored till now:\nApport is a nice utility which enables core file generations. Using /proc/sys/kernel/core_pattern I can format core files. This provides flexibility to redirect the core files to a predefined directory, name core files with pid, file path pattern appended or prep-ended to it,etc.. For non Ubuntu packages, I have to write hooks to generate core dumps (reports). Apport after collecting the report it will upload.\nThings that I do not understand:\n\n\n*\n\n*Is Apport the one I must be looking at?? I mean does it suffice my purpose? Or should I be looking at something else?\n\n*What kind of package does my application fall under? Do I call it non-ubuntu? 3rd part? what is it? I see different terminologies in documents?\n\n*As I mentioned, MyApp runs from /opt/myapplication/bin/MyApp, so where will the core files be generated? Current dir or /var/crash? Does Apport detect crashes trigerred from /opt? Does it interpret it?\n\n*Important question: If I have developed the application and if Apport uploads the report to Ubuntu repositories, it does not make sense. So how can I tell Apport to send the report to me.\n\n*I get this error: executable does not belong to a package, ignoring. So what am I doing wrong?\n\n*For apport to recognise my package, do I need to make it a source package? Is it mandatory? I just want to create a binary package? \n\n*I also saw somewhere in the documents that Apport recognises:\n\n*\n\n*Ubuntu packages or\n\n*Launchpad applications but my application is neither of these. So how does Apport help me in the current scenario?\n\n\n\nA: *\n\n*It looks close, but might not be what you need. Apport automatically changes /proc/sys/kernel/core_pattern.  So if that can't be changed, you're pretty much out of luck.  On the other hand, apport is in the default Ubuntu install now, so practically everyone using Ubuntu already has that parameter changed by it.  I'm also not aware of any way to tell apport to keep more than the most recent crash from a particular app, but as long as each crash is uploaded, that's not an issue.\n\n*I'd refer to it as third-party.\n\n*Apport supports executables installed in /opt.  You will need to provide a hook in /opt/path/to/your/app/share/apport/package-hooks.\n\n*You can set a custom crash database in the package-hook for your package.  But if your crash database doesn't act like debbugs or launchpad, you will also need to create a custom crash database connector implementation, which doesn't look like it can be done without installing a python file outside of /opt.\n\n*The executable needs to be installed by dpkg, which means you need to package it in a .deb file.\n\n*You have to create a source package in order to create a binary package, because binary packages are created from source packages.  You do not need to distribute the source package.\n\n*Apport works with anything packaged as a .deb file.\n\n", "Q: Using Unity with i3-wm Is it possible to use the Unity Panel (with or without launcher) with i3-wm instead of compiz?\nAnd if that's not possible, could I somehow use the HUD inside the i3 session?\n\nA: This is not possible with the true Unity 3d environment.  Unity is actually a compiz plugin running an Openbox toolkit called Nux, so to attempt to run Unity without compiz is an exercise in futility.  You could check into Unity 2d, however, which has a similar appearance, but is a separate set of packages not dependent on Compiz.\n", "Q: What package is responsible for modem (not) working and how do I downgrade it after a broken update? Suddenly my USB mobile broadband modem has stopped working and is completely unable to connect. I have done nothing, so it's surely some recent update of some network/modem related package (probably modemmanager or network-manager or god knows) that is completely broken and shamefully has been releases without proper testing.\nWhat is most properly the package responsible for this? Is it modemmanager, or some modem driver in which case how do I figure out which one? My modem is a Huawei K3565 Rev 2 (12d1:140c). It used to work \"fine\" (except for the handful of bugs that make one's life a hell, but i could always connect to the internet), now there's no way to connect.\nOnce I have figured out which package it is, how do I \"undo\" recent updates and manually go back to a working version? No way I wait until they fix this; it will take ages, and it was working.\n\nA: ok If you feel like due to updates its broken , then you can restore it to its born.

I know it is used to for encryption but I do not know more. \n\n\n*\n\n*How does it encrypt data?\n\n*Is it available for Ubuntu\n\n*How can I use it?\n\n\nA: TrueCrypt creates TrueCrypt volume containers (encrypted files) where you store your secret data. Later you can mount it like any other volume, by providing the password/keyfile. The good thing is that it works \"on the fly\", in other words, it encrypts/decrypts the data in RAM before making changes to disk, as you write/read files to/from the volume. It can also encrypt full partitions/drives. For the documentation, see: http://www.truecrypt.org/docs/\n\nA: As you said it is a software for encryption, for more information you'd better have a look at http://www.truecrypt.org/docs/.\n", "Q: how to create encrypt mount entry in /etc/mtab I am practicing Encryption from our Community link :FolderEncryption \nBut while doing fuserunmount command I am getting the following error.I am sure about the process .

Currently booting Ubuntu via a CD From a bit of personal troubleshooting (of which I am by no means any form or an expert!) by way of Ultimate Boot CD, I came to the conclusion that part of my HD was damaged when I dropped the laptop resulting in W7 not loading.\nI initially wanted to simply run Ubuntu from the CD to transfer my important documents from the HD to a flash drive, as the utilities on Ultimate Boot were too complicated for me to understand, and then purchase a new HD. \nI am now wondering if I was to fully install Ubuntu as my OS would it simply bypass the booting of windows and I can use my laptop like usual, apart from I will use this OS as opposed to Windows 7 (of which I'm not too fussed about!)\nFailing that I understand that my only other option would be to buy a new HD and a new Windows OS?\nI will apologise now if this post is not what is to be expected on here and also if what I have tried to describe is laughable! As I said, I'm no expert!\nThanks in advance. \n\nA: You're probably going to need a new Hard Drive\nDropping your laptop has very likely damaged at least the hard drive. Your ultimate boot CD likely has some kind of hard drive test tool, if you want to look for it. If not, your live CD should be able to give you a more basic test (search for \"drives\" in the Unity launcher). You can also try Drive Fitness Test for a more thorough test of your hard drive, without the kitchen sink of UBCD.\nIt doesn't matter what operating system you have, if the drive is bad, the drive is bad. Platter-based (non-solid state) hard drives are kind of like fancy record players - they have a read arm and disks that the read-arm reads. If you scratch one of the disks, it no longer works and you lose the data on that portion of the disk. If you break the read arm (ever hear clicking from a drive? That's a broken read arm), your data isn't technically lost, but recovering it without sending it to a professional with a clean room is unlikely (and becomes increasingly unlikely the longer you try to use the broken disk; just like a record player - if you damage the read arm or the needle, you can't use it any more, and if you try, you risk damaging your records).\nYou may not need a new copy of Windows\nIf your laptop came with Windows (ie - you bought it from a retailer such as Best Buy), you should have a sticker on the bottom with a CD key. You'll have to have a disk that has the same version of Windows, which you can borrow from someone or download from the Internet (the key is what's valuable, so downloading the installer is kosher, Microsoft might have Win7 on their site, but since it's no longer the newest, it might take a little digging).\nIf you bought your own copy (such as to upgrade from XP to Win7, or a custom build), then you can simply repeat the process of installing with the same disk and key.\n(And yes, both of these methods are kosher. The licensing is that a given copy can only be installed on one machine at a time. Your license key was freed up as soon as your drive was rendered unusable.)\nThere's a chance the automatic activation process won't work. If that happens, simply call Microsoft with the phone number the installer gives you. They're usually pretty good about activating it for you (most of the time, it's all automated).\nAlternatively, of course, you can just install Ubuntu and not worry about Windows licensing, but that's up to you.\nBack up your data right now\nAs I mentioned earlier, if your drive is damaged, it's only a matter of time before it fails completely, or corrupts data you have. Get it off as soon as humanly possible, and don't use your computer any more than absolutely necessary before you back up your data. For all intents and purposes, your drive is a ticking timebomb before it fails completely.\n", "Q: Xorg: no screens found on startup in 12.04.2 LTS I have an Intel IvyBridge video card.  This morning, my 12.04.02 LTS treated me to an Xorg server crash.\n\n\n*\n\n*Trying an older kernel worked once, but lead to the same error during reboot.

Obvious statement but the number of \"rogue\" processes that people have on their computers can cause this issue. The fact that the fan is constantly running and you still get heating issues means there is a rogue process.\nLook at simple utilities like top to see what is using your CPU cycles.\nUse the services command to determine that you haven't installed services like MYSQL or Apache that you don't need.\nIs the brightness set to high? (indirect heat contributor)\nAre there USB drives attached that are not self powered?\nOr is the fan running at a lower rate than in Windows so the fan is not doing the job it needs to to cool down the CPU. (There are fan utilities that allow you to see how quickly the fan is spinning in both O/S systems)\nWindows tends to have better fan control which is why I suggested the last item.\nRun with the most basic video driver.

Even if it doesn't solve your problem completely, MountManager will make it easier for you to mount and unmount your SD card manually. MountManager is no longer available from the default Ubuntu repositories for versions of Ubuntu newer than Ubuntu 12.10 and instead you can use the Disks application which is installed by default in Ubuntu.\nYou can take a look at a screenshot of mountmanager by searching for it in Synaptic Package Manager and clicking on \"Get Screenshot\", and you can also install it from Synaptic.\n\nA: I'm not sure if you're experiencing the same issue as me, but this gets it to automount on my laptop:\nsudo -i\necho 1 > /sys/bus/pci/rescan\nexit\n\n\nA: First check if really not mounted:\nmount  -l\n\nIf not, try to mount it manually:\nhttp://manpages.ubuntu.com/manpages/hardy/man8/mount.8.html shows you how to do this.

I need to be able to detect when this has happened (and ONLY) when it has happened from any distro, so that I can reliably remove the empty space. \nWhat's the best way to detect this? (ie via gtk_widget_... calls) What has been done to the GtkMenuBar to achieve this? Thanks.\n\nA: The problem isn't that anything in particular has been done to the GtkMenuBar (it's just been hidden). The problem is because you're using GtkFixed to position it, and so things do not automatically resize when the MenuBar goes away.\nIs there any particular reason you're using a GtkFixed to position things, rather than using the normal box layout structure of GTK+? You may want to look into using GtkApplication and/or GtkBuilder to create and present your user interface, instead, rather than using absolute positioning with GtkFixed.\nIf you wish to continue using GtkFixed, you'll need to watch a property (or signal) on the GtkMenuBar, and reposition and/or resize the other widgets in your window manually, when the GtkMenuBar is hidden.\n\nA: Here's what I finally had to resort to for multiple distros and the possibility the user has set an exception:\nstatic int menu_proxy = -1;\ntypedef void *(*KVoidPtoF)();\n\nvoid *proxylib;\nKVoidPtoF gtk_menu_proxy_get;\n\nmenu_proxy = 0;\nproxylib = dlopen(\"libappmenu.so\", RTLD_NOLOAD | RTLD_LAZY);\nif (proxylib)\n{\n    gtk_menu_proxy_get = (KVoidPtoF)dlsym(proxylib, \n        \"ubuntu_menu_proxy_get\");\n    if (gtk_menu_proxy_get && (*gtk_menu_proxy_get)() != 0)\n        menu_proxy = 1;\n}\n\n", "Q: Use wifi only when necessary To optimise my laptops battery life I would like to make it so that wifi gets turned on only when there is a process running which needs a network access.\nFor example when browser or transmission is started wifi turns on, but when I close them wifi also gets turned of.\nSomething like caffeine does for enabling and disabling screensaver when assigned processes are running.\n\nA: Yes, and no.

The bug page at Launchpad doesn't list your bug so far. So if you describe the problem and what helped you the maintainer might release a new version soon.\nBuilding the source from source seems the best solution at the moment. In the case of dcraw it is sufficient to just replace the executable. If you want a more nice and clean solution I would suggest building an own Ubuntu deb package. You can use apt-get source dcraw to retrieve the old source files. Now you replace the old dcraw.c with the new one and try to rebuild the package. Now you get a new deb file, which you can install using dpkg or Software Center.\nA third option is to use a package from another distribution. For instance OpenSUSE has a newer version than Ubuntu. You can download the RPM file and use alien to make a deb package from the RPM.\n\nA: Since this is an old report with no accepted answer, I'll suggest testing current versions of dcraw and ufraw. At least the latter should have improved Fuji X support by now (>0.20).\n", "Q: Ubuntu on old platform I have an old PC that I did a complete wipe drive on and would like to install Ubuntu 12.10 on it once the DVD order arrives.

I do not intend this PC to be \"dual boot\" so what is the proper installation procedure to use? \nNote:  I am not familiar with Linux/Unix\n\nA: Insert the DVD, and click 'Install Now.' Ubuntu will detect that you have no OS on it, so you won't have to dual-boot. Then follow the steps and enjoy Linux!\nHope this helps!\n\nA: You can just insert the DVD and boot to it. Once you are in Ubuntu you have the option to try it or install  it. If you want to, click install and it will walk you through the steps.

What is the advised directory to put a downloaded python library? Should I be concerned about confusing apt?\n\nA: If you are the only user on the machine that needs access to this Python module then avoid placing it anywhere outside your home directory. You can place it pretty much anywhere under your home directory and add that directory to your PYTHONPATH environment variable. For example, you may place it under ~/Projects/MySoftwareProject/Packages/ and then add this directory to PYTHONPATH whenever you work on that project. A more convenient method of doing this is to use virtualenv to create isolated Python environment for different projects. \nIf you need to install this Python module system wide (so that multiple users may be able to use it) look for it in the standard package repository first. If you cannot find it there then look for a PPA for it; maybe the developer of this module has created one. If you cannot find one, you may want to create one (it will help others). Installing it manually ought to be the last resort. :D \nHaving said that, if you absolutely do need to install it manually, a good place to install packages locally is /usr/local. So, for example, this module may be placed under /usr/local/lib/python2.7/site-packages. \n", "Q: How to get hdmi sound to TV on Asus M3A78-EM computer No hdmi sound to TV on Asus M3A78-EM computer\nWhile my onboard Radeon HD 3000-3300 series hdmi on my Asus M3A78-EM computer sends great video to the TV, I haven't yet got sound on the TV.

This might be one of them.\nMy suggestion would be to wipe 13.04 and install the 12.04LTS version. This will give you the most stable version of Ubuntu, and the version that will be supported for the longest time. It'll also be the best way to learn about Ubuntu & Linux in general.

Anyways, I just successfully configured multi interface with ice house and ubuntu 14.04. I am using flatdhcp nova network configuration. Following are the steps.\n\n\n*\n\n*Create 2 n/w using nova network-create command, each with 2 different bridges (say br100 and br101)\n\n*Then launch an instance attaching these 2 n/w. \n\n*By default using ubuntu 14.04 cloud image, only eth0 is configured. So image comes up with eth0 having ip address allocated.

I don't want to install Ubuntu-desktop or anything, I don't need an entire desktop, just the ability to render directly to the screen.\nI've read a bit about X.  I assume I need to make something that implements it.  Are there references that explain this?  I'm assuming a low level language (e.g. C) will be necessary, but obviously I'd feel more comfortable if it was a higher level language required (e.g. Python).\nPlease let me know, I can't seem to find anything on Google.  I don't think I'm searching for the right thing, perhaps I just need refined search terms.\nWhat I'm developing is an application that I want to install on a single board computer.  The computer would only be used for the purpose of this application, so I don't want to waste resources loading ubuntu-desktop or gnome just so that I can render my application.  I really just don't want the extra overhead.  Let me know if that changes anything.\n\nA: If you want to do full-screen applications with no windows involved and use Python over C, you have several options:\nGame engines: For example the SDL library. Python bindings exist here. \nSDL applications run on top of X, wayland, framebuffer, SVGALib and much more. It will give you full-screen graphics and for a SOC you will only need a frame-buffer-device, e.g. when you see the Linux mascot during boot, you are already there. However, if you have some advanced GUI like a modern car cockpit in mind, it might involve OpenGL for anti-aliasing. For an ATM (automatic teller machine) like GUI it will miss the standard buttons and boxes which you would have to implement yourself. Many SDL games in the ubuntu repositiories can be recompiled to run under a framebuffer.\nLinux installers: The debian-installer uses the gtk+ toolkit on top of a framebuffer device, no X involved. You will have all Gtk+ widgets at your command, and good text rendering with pango, modern graphics with anti-aliasing with cairo. Python bindings exist. The OpenSuse distribution has a similar installer on top of QT.\nText mode graphics (TUI): If you have only text output with a few buttons to render, consider using the ncurses library. It will allow you a textual user interface with a high-level API. midnight-commander is a good example. Python bindings exist.\nCommercial biddings: If this is a professional project, employing other commercial toolkits and realtime operating systems is an option. See also this  and similar tagged questions, even without linux at Stack Overflow.\nHelpful search keywords\n\n\n*\n\n*microcontroller gui library\n\n*immediate mode graphics\n\n*DirectFB\n\n*RTOS graphics\n\n*RTOS gui toolkit\n\n*custom linux gui\n\n\nA: Most users who don't install GUIs don't want to run GUI applications. There are many options for installing a GUI on a server and some of them are quite lightweight. You do not need a whole desktop environment to use the X window system. Installing X11 and a window manager, or possibly even a lightweight desktop environment, will probably do what you need.\nIf you've considered that (including the part about CLI users wanting to run CLI programs), you probably have a remarkable, unique set of circumstances for wanting to do this. If you expand your question to explain them, you might get more useful answers.\nIf you really do want to reinvent the lightbulb and reimplement your own GUI, aquaherd's comment (which I'm hoping will become an answer soon) explains the basics of how. \n", "Q: How to find python installation directory on Ubuntu I have just migrated from Windows environment.

I am a C/C++ developer. I would like to run my .exe programs on my computer (which only has Ubuntu on it). I would like to know if there are any C/C++ Runtime Enviroments out there.\n\nA: This has nothing to do with C++ at all. Windows and linux binaries are different and you wont be able to run a .exe natively. There are compatibility libraries that can run most windows programs but at the cost of some performance. The most widely used one is wine.\n\nA: Install the build-essential package using the following command:\nsudo apt-get install build-essential\n\nYou can then use 'g++' to compile your source code so it can be run on that machine.

You will either have to correct this error or to remove the file.\nSo use a Live CD or USB and boot from that. When the system is up, use \"Try Ubuntu\" and open the hard drive. You'll find it normally in the sidebar or you can open a terminal and enter ls /media. Your mounted hard drive lives there. Navigate to home/imight. The whole path is /media/SOMETHING/home/imight, where SOMETHING depends on the layout of your drive. The best option is to rename the file .profile to some other name.

I have a new MSI GT70 with windows 8, which has the new UEFI settings, and it just won't install ubuntu 12.10. I have tried a lot of different options to try and install it. I have tried using nomodeset and acpi=off,but everything has failed. I have even tried going into the bios and turning off fast boot, secure boot, and switched it over to legacy mode. All have got me somewhere in the installation, but it will not actually install ubuntu. By the way I have been using a CD.\nAt first when I just tried to install ubuntu without any special stuff from the bios, a screen with four options would appear. The top option was try ubuntu without installing, then install ubuntu, then OEM, and finally check disc for defects. Any option I hit enter on would cause my computer to just go to a black screen.\nNext I tried to switch the bios settings to turning off fast boot, secure boot, and switching it to legacy mode. After I did this, I got the furthest with the installation, but it still failed. What happened was, it brought up a new ubuntu menu where six items appeared. They were the same as before with two additional ones that said boot from first hard drive and something else I cannot remember.If I entered into any of these options, it would display a bunch of code in like a command prompt, but then at the end, it would go to a black screen yet again.\nMy computer has two internal drives on it, one 128gb SSD and another 750gb HDD.\nLet me know if you need anymore info. I really need to install ubuntu for school. Someone please help. Thanks in advance.\n\nA: You have to use amd64 version of ubuntu. You can get it here.\nFrom the same link:\nHave a new PC with the Windows 8 logo or using UEFI firmware?\nPlease use a 64-bit flavour of Ubuntu desktop.\n\nFull reason here for it to only work with the 64bit version.\n", "Q: Mount shared Ubuntuone folder Is it possible to mount a folder, which is shared by another person into my Ubuntu-One folder (or any other) to my Ubuntu system (not the Web-interface). It also would be nice to do this via fstab.\n\nA: Ubuntu One's file sync service is synchronization, and not remote file storage. This means the client will download everything in a folder to the machine you choose to synchronize that folder to, rather than creating a mount point to a remote server.\nIf you've accepted a share from someone, you can open the Ubuntu One control panel and in the Folders tab of the interface, the folders which are shared to you will be listed. You can simply check the folder in question to enable synchronizing it to your computer, and all the files in that folder that was shared to you, will start downloading.\n", "Q: Formatting windows 7 partition to give it to ubuntu? I have 2 partitions Windows7 and Ubuntu.\nBoth are installed and running well, except I would like to get rid of my windows 7 or at least a part of it and give that space to ubuntu.\nSo I am looking for the best way (not sure if it's doable too) to format my windows 7 partition and give that space to my ubuntu parition.\n\nA: This is not difficult to do; but you will need to create a bootable Ubuntu CD or USB, as you cannot edit or remove a partition you are currently using. Once you have done this, boot into it and open Gparted then delete the partition you no longer want. You can then right click on the other and expand it to fill the remaining space. \nReboot into Ubuntu and run\nsudo update-grub\n\nto remove the old Windows entry from your boot menu.\nWARNING 1:\nResizing partitions always has the potential to cause data loss, although such loss is very unlikely.\nWARNING 2:\nResizing and moving partitions CAN (depending on your exact partition layout) confuse GRUB and render your machine temporarily unbootable. This is easily fixed by using something like the Super Grub Disk to boot back into your machine, though that requires you having a separate working machine to create a Super Grub Disk with. You can then run sudo update-grub to restore normal booting.\nALSO CONSIDER:\nConsider reinstalling Ubuntu over your entire disk, which will result in a cleaner system overall. This will, however, wipe all data on your disk.\n", "Q: Media Players breaking the videos I have a problem with my Media Players in Ubuntu 12.04 .

This method is not a true upgrade, but it is a lot faster, (the iso is compressed) and safer too. \nAs a side note you might want to make sure you like the unity interface, the old gnome one is no longer installed as an option.

The charging-only cable only uses 2 pins to provide power (electricity), and do not put any signal on the 2 data pins, so when they are used, the USB devices have issues connecting to the OS, regardless of the OS type: Windows or Linux.\nThe 2 references are:\n\n*\n\n*Wikipedia: Universal Serial Bus, \"Connector Types\" section\n\n\"To reliably enable a charge-only feature, modern USB accessory peripherals now include charging cables that provide power connections to the host port but no data connections, and both home and vehicle charging docks are available that supply power from a converter device and do not include a host device and data pins, allowing any capable USB device to charge or operate from a standard USB cable.\"\n\n\n\n*Differences between a USB charge only cable and a data charge cable\nAnyway, I'm grateful that eventually it was solved and hope your issue will be solved soon too.\n\nA: Maybe your USB device has over-current protection?\nPlease try the instructions from the following page and let us know if they helped.\n\nUSB has an over-current protection, which gets triggered when power consumption from the port is too high.\nUnplug all USB devices from PC, turn power off, and wait a minute or two.

(Instead of the master output) How?\nMy laptop has only one sound card. I thought, maybe it's possible to connect my phone (via icecast?) to the headphone output. That way, I can use my phone's output (by listening to the Icecast stream) to pre-listen and use the laptop audio out as master.\nI don't think doing the opposite (master over icecast on the phone, pre-listen via the laptop audio out) would be such a great idea, as streaming is inherently unreliable and I don't want to put the master over an unreliable connection.

The first thing I did was format the HD remove all secure boot/UEFI options in the BIOS and - after a futile attempt at installing Windows 7 - re-installed Windows 8 Professional.\nI mainly use Ubuntu (99% of the time) so it is very important for me to get it running on this pc. However, when I try running the installer for 12.10 I get the black screen issue, and if I use the \"nomodeset\" method, I still don't get to the installation questions. The strange thing is that when I launch the computer now, I get the choice between Windows and Ubuntu, as if it were installed (which it might be?), not in Grub, but in Windows 8, but if I select Ubuntu I go into black screen, or, with \"nomodeset\", it stalls after a few seconds of script.\nI'm very ignorant in all these things, but I'm computer savvy, so I got to all these things by following the forums. However, I don't seem to find anything similar to the problem I'm having.\nBTW - I tried to return the pc today, but because of some stupid fine print I can't, so I'M STUCK WITH IT, so I really want this to work.\nThanks,\nJulian\n\nA: Do you have a win8 recovery dvd? Maybe you can go back the factory settings and try to do it again. I've installed ubuntu 12.10 and share it with  my win 8 and everything went fine.\nI just had to disable the the secureboot ,create some new  partitions using gparted (from the live cd) and install ubuntu, that was all for me.\nSome links that might help:\nhttp://sourceforge.net/projects/linux-secure/files/ --> .iso with boot-repair (just in case)\nhttps://help.ubuntu.com/community/UEFI\nHope it helps :)\n", "Q: Ubuntu not booting after installing in external hard disk I have Lenovo z570 laptop with 750GB HDD, 6GB RAM, Intel i5 Processor and Windows 7 installed in it. I also have an external portable USB hard-disk of 1TB.\nMy aim was to install Ubuntu 12.10 onto the external hard disk including Grub boot loader onto it too.\nI use my external hard disk to store my backup data. In order to install Linux onto it I made some free space in the hard about 50 GB using Windows partition tool. I successfully did it without loosing any data.\nThen I downloaded Ubuntu 12.10 32bit ISO, made an boot-able USB, and I booted into Ubuntu successfully. I then went on with installing Ubuntu.

I can confirm this because ntldr is a boot loader for Windows. \nPossible reasons:\n\n\n*\n\n*You didn't choice to boot from the USB flash drive correctly  or\n\n*The GRUB was installed wrong. \n\n\nPossible solutions:\n\n\n*\n\n*Just turned on the PC enter in the BIOS and select the USB device as the first option to boot.\n\n*Repair the GRUB\n", "Q: Does MaaS 1.2 have a built-in tftp server? I am trying MaaS 1.2 on 12.10. However as declared it conflicts with tftpd-hpa. My question is does it contain a built-in tftp? I tried to install tftpd-hpa on another node, but there is no pxelinx.cfg dir in /var/lib/tftpd. In 12.04 with MaaS 0.1 everything is ready, including tftp and cfgs. Moreover, nothing is mentioned on \"http://maas.ubuntu.com/docs/install.html\". Could anyone give some hints? Thanks!\n\nA: The new MaaS on Ubuntu 12.10 doesn't need tftp server. It uses a python/twisted based tftp server, which I believe is far more efficient. Hence, you don't need to install anything else. And it doesn't need configuration as well.\nThe tftp related files are stored in /var/lib/maas/tftp folder.\nAnd the kernel option changes if required, can be done in kernel_opts.py file found in\n/usr/share/pyshared/provisioningserver/ folder.\nHope you find this useful.\n", "Q: Partitioning: Moving an extended partition (containing / and swap) to extend another partition Take a look at my GParted screenshot below:\n\nAs you can see my sda3 primary partition is separated by the extended partition that contains my / and swap logical partitions.\nI'd like to move sda3 to be adjacent with unallocated to extend it. After some reading, the only potential issue I can find has something to do with /boot, which is located in sda1 so it shouldn't be a problem (right?)!\nMy question is: Is it safe? Any issues I need to be worried about? More importantly: can anyone point me in the right direction? Maybe pointers/step-by-step instructions?\nThanks in advance! \nPS: I know my partitioning is a little bit weird (newbie here). I'm planning on shrinking root and merging it with sda3 :)\n\nA: Considering the fact that your root (/) partition (sda5) is too large and you also intend to reduce its size I think the best method to follow is this:\n\n\n*\n\n*Increase the size of your Extended Partition (sda4) to the right, i.e. taking in the free space at the end.\n\n*Move your swap partition (sda6) to the right (you can make it 4GB as well)\n\n*Move your root (/) partition (sda5) to the right and reduce its size to 20-30 GB.\n\n*Reduce the size of your Extended Partition (sda4) from the left, leaving a large free space before it.\n\n*Finally increase the size of your data partition (sda3) to the right, taking in the whole free space.\n\n\nYou can do this using GParted on a live CD/DVD/USB and you might also need to unmount your swap partition as it will probably be mounted automatically.\nSafety? Nothing and nobody is 100% safe ;-)\nNormally, all these 5 steps (simply moving and re-sizing partitions) should go well without any problems and your system should be completely unaffected as long as you don't attempt to delete/create partitions.\nBut, just in case, keep your fingers crossed ;-)\nPossible precautions:\n\n\n*\n\n*Make a backup of your disk or partitions, for example using Clonezilla, Parted Magic, Redo, etc.\n\n*Check if your system is intact after performing each step.\n\n", "Q: Command line not working?

If you had been using UUIDs to refer to your filesystem this would not have happened.  You should be able to press the e key at the grub meu to edit the command, and insert the p before the partition number in the kernel root argument to boot, then you will want to update your /etc/fstab to either also insert the p or switch it to use the UUID instead, then run update-grub.\n", "Q: What event failed?

I have Windows 7 operating off an HDD and am going to install Ubuntu on to another seperate HDD. \nHow will I determine the boot options? through Bios by the HDD each time I start, or is there a bit of software that ubuntu installs that allows me to choose which OS to boot when I turn the computer on after the bios runs it's checks?\n\nA: Traditional Install (through bootable USB/DVD)\nIf you install from a bootable disc or USB stick, if everything goes correctly (which is the case 99% of the time for most computers/laptops), you'll get a bootloader option right after the BIOS screen.\nThis is called Grub, which is the default bootloader for Ubuntu. From there you'll be able to choose between the different OS's installed in the different partitions and/or disks on your computer.\nBasically, Grub will be written into somewhere in the first 100 GB sector (the MBR, or Master Boot Record) of your hard disk (if there are multiple disks, the BIOS will look based on the boot order configured in the BIOS settings). The BIOS will be looking for a bootloader there, find Grub, which will let you choose as mentioned above.\nJust make sure you don't end up wiping the partition where Windows 7 is currently residing. There's an option during install that does the partitioning and stuff for you automatically, so it shouldn't be a problem :)\nWubi Install (not recommended)\nWhen installing using the Wubi method, Ubuntu is installed similar as an application while you're in Windows 7. It creates a virtual disk image and puts all the necessary files in there.\nIn this case you'll get the Windows bootloader. Far more inferior than Grub in many ways. A lot of people also have problems with Wubi installations (whether it's during or after the install, bad stuff happens almost all the time). So I strongly discourage you from going this route!\n", "Q: Unable to Extend Ubuntu Partition Size I'm trying to increase the size of my Ubuntu partition.\nMy partitions, overall, are sort of a mess.

Anywho, I'm trying to merge the unallocated space with the /dev/sda6 partition, but I can't seem to figure out how to do it using GParted. \nDo I have to use the LiveCD for that? \nAnd if so, do I use the Ubuntu liveCD or some other disk? I'll attach a window-screengrab from GParted running in Ubuntu. \nScreengrab: http://imgur.com/vKdEIRb\n\nA: You can't alter a mounted partition. Obviously your /dev/sda6 partition is mounted (since it contains root, /) since you're running Ubuntu with it. Also, the little key icon/symbol indicates that it is locked (a.k.a in use).\nSo yes you'll need to boot into a LiveCD or LiveUSB in order to do this.\n", "Q: Record Live stream How do I record the live streaming screen with audio?

And yes, i have been looking around and also found something called subordinate services which could look like a solution to that, but i am not sure and defiantly not sure how to set that up.. \nAnyone who can help me here?\n\nA: --to is what you looking for:\njuju deploy wordpress --to 0\njuju deploy mysql --to 0\n\nWill deploy to the same 0 node.\nReferences and examples:\n\n\n*\n\n*https://jujucharms.com/docs/stable/charms-deploying#deploying-to-specific-machines-and-containers\n\nA: In theory, you can also use linux containers on the same machine or even your local machine. With linux containers you'll have some form of isolation between processes and each charm will get its own IP address from the DHCP server on your dedicated subnet (if you have a DHCP server installed).\nhttps://jujucharms.com/docs/stable/config-local\nThis is working for local openstack test environments, but its not working for all charms. In particular it has problems with deploying wordpress. \nWordpress deployed with LXC fail\nIf you have a physical machine at you disposal you can try this:\njuju deploy --to lxc:0 mysql\njuju deploy --to lxc:0 wordpress\njuju add-relation mysql:db wordpress:db\njuju expose wordpress\n\nThis will deploy mysql and wordpress on machine0 (your first juju machine) and both in isolated linux containers.\nYou can find some great articles about LXC in the following series:\nYour first Ubuntu Container\nIn general it is adviced not to deploy charms without any form of isolation (aka without LXC/LXD/KVM) on the same machine. But in this case, I believe, you are stuck with doing just that.\n", "Q: How to separate a given type of file from others? I have a folder containing about 6000 .pdf, .jpg, .doc and .djvu files out of which I want to separate all the .djvu files and move them to another new folder. I was wondering if there is a quicker way to do so than handpicking.\n\nA: Try:\nmv *.djvu target_directory/\n\n", "Q: How to bulk convert .djvu files to .pdf? I have about 200 .djvu ebooks which I want to convert into .pdf. Since one-by-one conversion is tiresome I want to know if there is a way to convert them all at once. Any help will be appreciated.\n\nA: You could use ddjvu, in a shell script. That said, the output PDFs are much larger (x10), which makes it hardly worth the effort. Ubuntu has no problem reading djvu files, but if your reason is good enough, use the following script. \nWarning: Do not try it on 200 files right away. Run a test first on one or two small ones, to get the feel of how long it takes, and to make sure you are satisfied with the result. Press Ctrl + C, in case you want to stop the process.\n#!/bin/bash\nfor i in *.djvu;\ndo ddjvu -format=pdf -scale=100 \"$i\" \"${i/%.djvu/}.pdf\"\ndone\n\n...or the same, as a one-liner\nfor i in *.djvu; do ddjvu -format=pdf -scale=100 \"$i\" \"${i/%.djvu/}.pdf\";done\n\nSimply run that in a folder with djvu files. The -scale=100 option downscales the output images, which makes the process much faster, and the output files' size more reasonable. Without it, the resulting PDFs were much larger then the originals, and took ages to convert, at least in my tests.\n\nA: Personally I really like Calibre, which is a great for managing, converting, synching, sharing and editing ebooks. You can do batch conversions with it and djvu to PDF is supported.\nTo install, just enter the following via cli:\nsudo apt-get install calibre\n\nYou can find info on the software at http://calibre-ebook.com/about\nI hope it helps. :)\n", "Q: How do I open a pdf file in a virtual console? I want to open pdf files from within the virtual console and view them in the console itself.

Here is a brief description of fbi taken from it's man page:\n\n    fbi  displays  the  specified  file(s)  on  the linux console using the\n    framebuffer device.  PhotoCD, jpeg, ppm, gif, tiff, xwd,  bmp  and  png\n    are  supported  directly.

But after I switched to Ubuntu 12.04 LTS, it's not working now. \n\nA: This seems to be a bug in 12.04.2. As stated in comments, a simple fix would be unloading the mouse driver and load it again like this:\nsudo modprobe -r psmouse\nsudo modprobe psmouse proto=imps\n\nThis only keeps the touchpad working on this session. To make it permanent one can create a file like /etc/modprobe.d/psmouse.conf (you can choose the name you want, but you must keep the extension) with the following content:\noptions psmouse proto=imps\n\n", "Q: ssl only specify website I already made a SSL certificate for my server, but can I use the SSL only for specific website.\nFor example inside /var/www I have a lot web folder and I want the \"A\" website used HTTPS and the others not used HTTPS.\nHow to setup?\n\nA: The Apache wiki has a nice page about SSL with Virtual Hosts Using SNI. They describe the setup step by step. I'll write here the main points.\nYou need OpenSSL version 0.9.8f or later. If you use Ubuntu Hardy Heron (8.04) or later you'll get the correct version. Furthermore OpenSSL should have TLSExtensions enabled. This is the default case since version 0.9.8k (Lucid, 10.04). You Apache version should have SNI support. Have a look into your error.log:\n\n[warn] Init: Name-based SSL virtual hosts only work for clients with TLS \n             server name indication support (RFC 4366)\n\nIf you find the message above SNI is enabled and if you see the message below SNI is not built in.\n\nYou should not use name-based virtual hosts in conjunction with SSL\n\nIn your default config you should have TLSv1 set as a supported protocol. Look for the variable SSLProtocol. If you don't find any settings, you can add:\nSSLProtocol All -SSLv2\n\nThis adds supportfor all knowns flavors of SSL and TLS, but not SSL version 2.\nNow you have to setup your vrtual host and also maybe activate SSL support (sudo a2ensite ssl plus Apache restart):\n<virtualhost *:443>\n        SSLEngine On\n        SSLCertificateFile /path/to/your/sslcert\n        DocumentRoot /path/your/webcontent\n</virtualhost>\n\nFurthermore set SSLStrictSNIVHostCheck on in your Apache or vhost config. Now you can restart your Apache and will probably have SSL support. However SNI has lots of pitfalls. If you encounter any errors check your error.log. It might give you advice what went wrong.\nThe Apache documentation has some detailed description about their SSL support. \n", "Q: Do I need to install \"Swift\" to make Charms work? I want to deploy charms. I tried glance on jujucharms.com for example. \nIn section REQUIRES>> several different components are listed.

Preferably with Zend Framework installed?\nI have been working on a local workstation with the Desktop version of Ubuntu, and have setup AMP and Zend Framework a few times.  Now I'm ready to push a beta live and I've got myself an AWS account with an EC2 server.  Domain names are routing there.\nI know that the process for setting up the server version of Ubuntu will be much the same as setting up the Desktop version, but since the terminal is not second nature to me, I thought I'd ask this question in the interests of eliminating one of the hurdles.

If not you can use apt-cache to try to find the right package:\napt-cache search libqt*webkit*\n\nIf you can't find anything, you can try to use the Qt4 package I stated above, but I doubt it would help anything.\nHope it helps.\n", "Q: Desktop not working after removing unity 11.10 in ubuntu 11.10 on a macbook pro 7.1 i just removed unity and installed back gnome, everything is working perfectly but the desktop. Looks like i can't right-click on it, (while i can on panels and menu), not even with ctrl+alt+right-click and if i $touch something, it creates something but it does not appear in desktop view ( the one with background ).\nIt's not fundamental but would be nice :)\nThanks\nps: I know it's probably a common issue and I searched but its rather difficult to find something, since all keywords refers also to gnome-desktop, and install only related issues are shown :/\n\nA: Try these commands in terminal:\ngsettings set org.gnome.desktop.background draw-background true\ngsettings set org.gnome.desktop.background show-desktop-icons true\n\n\nA: That's a feature of Gnome 3.

Windows will install it's own bootloader and that's ok. Two ways to fix the bootloader include:\nEasy BCD: This is a great tool for editing the boot menu. You don't have to pay for it (I would recommend donating though...) and it works well. This is a preferable option if you need to get a dual boot working with the Windows bootloader. I haven't tried to edit GRUB with it, but I think there's that option.\nBoot-Repair: Boot up your system with an installation disk and choose the Try Ubuntu option. Add the repository, install boot-repair and it will give you some powerful options for modifying GRUB. boot-repair instructions can be found here: boot-repair\nI would recomend the Easy BCD route. I've had the most success with it and it's pretty simple to figure out. That's all I got, so good luck and have fun :D\n", "Q: Is there any repository for installing PHP 5.2.x on Ubuntu 12.04? I would like to know if there is any repository I can add to install php5.2.9+ on Ubuntu Server 12.04.\n\nA: PHP 5.2 was sent to end of life in December of 2010, so while there's a small chance you might find a PPA or .deb file in some dark alley of the Internet, you're very likely going to have to compile it from source if you want it to run on Ubuntu 12.04. Additionally, it's possible you'll run into problems with dependencies (particularly if anything has changed their API), so keep that in mind.\nThat said, you can find the latest source for the PHP 5.2 series on their GitHub (I found the 5.2.17 tag for you), and compile it using make. The PHP site also offers information on compiling PHP. The required versions will be different, but it's typically a \"this version or greater\" unless you get into major release differences (1.0 to 2.0, for example).\nAs a side note, it might be worth putting pressure on the people that maintain your external application to upgrade to at least the 5.3 series, or better yet, the 5.4 series. There have been a ton of bug fixes and security patches since then. Additionally, most tools don't support 5.2 anymore (which means you don't get things like Xdebug or PHPUnit without a fight, making maintaining an application of decent size and reasonable importance damn near impossible (I've been there)). The upgrade may not be something that can be done right away, thanks to changes between 5.2 and 5.3, but it generates customer demand and helps break down the delusion that a lot of companies have of \"well, our userbase doesn't  want this, so we're not going to offer it\" (even though the reason they don't demand it is because it was absent from the product and they found workarounds, nevermind the fact that if the product offered it, the customers would use it).\n\nA: I had never done it on Ubuntu, but yes in Debian Squeeze using the respository of Debian Lenny.\nAs the packages of PHP are all from Debian I think that this tutorial will server for Ubuntu.\n\n\n*\n\n*Edit the repository list.\nsudo nano /etc/apt/sources.list\n\n\n*Add the next line to ther /etc/apt/sources.list:\ndeb http://archive.debian.org/debian-archive/debian/ lenny main contrib non-free\n\n\n*Update the information of repos\nsudo apt-get update\n\n\n*Edit the preferences of apt...\nsudo nano /etc/apt/preferences.d/php.conf\n\n\n*Add the next conf:\nPackage: php5*\nPin: release a=oldstable\nPin-Priority: 700\n\nPackage: *\nPin: release a=stable\nPin-Priority: 600\n\n\n*Install\n    sudo apt-get install php5 -t oldstable\n\n*Check that is the 5.2* version installed\nsudo dpkg -l | grep php5\n\nI repeat... not tested... just what i do on Debian ...\nOriginal source: http://www.gustavopilla.com/2012/01/21/php-5-2-en-debian-squeeze/\n\nA: Anyone who ends up here should consider following this tutorial.\nIt explains in details how to compile and setup PHP 5.2 alongside the supported PHP version and how to use in only on the needed vhost.\n", "Q: Will deleting stuff from the Ubuntu partition (directly) increase free space on a Windows XP partition? My system has dual boot: windows xp and ubuntu. Accessing files and directories of windows xp from ubuntu is easy as well known.

When I boot to windows xp, I expected some more free disk space after some delete from ubuntu, but the free disk space is unchanged as nothing happened, but deleted files and directories from ubuntu have all gone. Where is this space?\nThank you.\n-Paul\n\nA: *\n\n*Ubuntu and Windoze will (generally) be on different partitions.\n\n*If you delete stuff on partition A, this will increase free space on partition A, but not on partition B.\n\n*You'd need to repartition, e.g. with gparted (booted from CD), to materialize the gain in free space on partition B.\n\nA: This link might be of some help to you - \nhttps://help.ubuntu.com/community/RecoverLostDiskSpace\n", "Q: Why can't I change the wallpaper in Gnome Shell and Unity?

I have a Toshiba 1TB portable back-up drive that I want to install Kubuntu on.\nThe question I have is should I reformat the drive? And if so what File System?\nI want to use the portable HD to boot up my laptop with it.\n\nA: Update for Ubuntu 18.04 and above\nNew installations of recent versions of Ubuntu does not use a separate swap partition any more. They use a swap file by default.\nOriginal Answer\nUbuntu cannot be installed on NTFS, FAT32, or any other Windows formatted hard drive. It uses at least two partitions, the main one is called / and is formatted ext4. The second one is called swap and has its own format as well called swap.\nIf you don't want to use the portable drive to share data with Windows, you can let Kubuntu install take over the whole disk and do it's formatting and partitioning during installation. This way, the drive will not be readable when plugged into a Windows machine (without installing additional software in Windows).\nIf you want to use the drive with Windows, you will have to make a NTFS partition along with the / and swap needed by Kubuntu. In this case only you have to make the partitions and format them in their respective format by yourself. This can be done during the installation process itself.\nHope this helps\n\nA: If your using it as a USB boot disk you could create a live USB installer. Set aside enough memory for the system to use and use the rest of the space on the HDD for storage. This would prevent you from having to format the whole drive and you could keep the data that's on it. You could also use a partition editor to set aside enough space for the OS and do as the previous poster suggests. Again this would prevent having to reformat the whole drive.\n", "Q: Remove 3.8.0-030800 I have a HP Pavilion dv3-2150 ep with 12.10 x64 ubuntu.\nI don't know much about ubuntu, but with some patience and google, everything's possible...\nYesterday i had a problem after an (automatic) update, my atheros wlan card didn't work (i connect to the router, but haven't internet), so i google for some solutions...

I would like to control the dimensions of my Ubuntu Desktop. Currently the files I download onto the Desktop do not seem visible, as the Desktop extends well below what's displayed on the screen. I have attached a screenshot where the filename of the bottom-most file (and several files under that) is cut off. \nIs there a setting which I can change?\n \nxrandr output:  \n\n\nA: I have tried a setup like yours and the problem seems to be the fact that the screens are not \"aligned\". Probably because the 17' one is under a little Unity/Nautilus treats it as more space.\nI don't know if this is normal or is a bug in either Unity or Nautilus, but to me it seems a normal behavior. To fix it just align both displays as in the following picture:\n \nSo just drag the second monitor on \"Display\" settings until they are somehow aligned. Also note that the disposition of both screens seems to matter, so if you put 27' screen on top of the 17' one the icons that do not fit on the first go to the second one. If that's what you want keep them aligned but with this disposition:\n\nAfter applying the new setup you need to order the icons again in Nautilus.\n\nA: Your screenshot is actually helpful, especially the line Screen 0: ... current 3200x1533. That tells you the screen size according to xrandr is 3200x1533. You can reset this using xrandr with the --fb option. In your case you could try xrandr --fb 1280x1024. Normally that value is supposed to be the smallest of the resolutions of your different displays.\nFor more information, see the man xrandr page:\n   --fb widthxheight\n          Reconfigures the screen to the specified size. All configured monitors must fit within this size. When this option is not pro‐\n          vided,  xrandr  computes  the smallest screen size that will hold the set of configured outputs; this option provides a way to\n          override that behaviour.\n\n   --fbmm widthxheight\n          Sets the reported values for the physical size of the screen. Normally, xrandr resets the reported  physical  size  values  to\n          keep the DPI constant.  This overrides that computation.\n\n\nA: Do you have two monitors attached?\nIn any case have you tried to to click \"System Settings\" and then \"Displays\"?

I'm trying to set up an Ubuntu 12.04 server so that users with a valid account in a remote ldap server can login to the ubuntu server.\nI've followed this guide closely: http://wiki.linuxquestions.org/wiki/Pam_ldap.\nWhen I try to ssh into that machine, this is what I see in /var/log/auth.log BEFORE entering my password:\nConnection from 192.168.0.10 port 36624\nInvalid user bentrupk from 192.168.0.10\ninput_userauth_request: invalid user bentrupk [preauth]\n\nHowever, using a packet sniffer, I'm also seeing a successful query to the ldap server using my username that returns my DN in ldap.\nThen I enter my password but the packet sniffer shows an ldap bind request with the right DN but with a password of \"....INCORRECT\".\nObviously, that's not the password what I entered.\nI'm assuming it's a problem with 1 or more of my pam.d config files.\nI'm wondering if there is a hint from the \"Invalid user\" in the auth.log? There is clearly a request being made to the ldap server with the username provided by ssh before I enter my password that successfully returns the correct entry.\nHowever, it's unclear to me which happens first: \"Invalid user\" in the auth.log OR the ldap search seen in the packet sniffer (and just to be clear the ssh user does not have a local account).\nWhat can I do to debug this further or confirm that I have the right configuration?\n\nA: I was making an incorrect assumption about what the PAM modules did. I assumed that having an account in LDAP could actually cause a module to create the user on the system (an assumption probably influenced by my webdev background) much like it could also create the home directories (pam_mkhomedir).\nOnce I created the users locally using:\nsudo adduser doej --disabled-password\n\nI was able to login with the doej account in LDAP.\nIncidentally, I found a solution using pam_exec that would allow me to dynamically create the users, too.\n\nA: There is no need for local accounts to exist for ldap accounts to be able to log in.\nPerhaps when it fails to find the proper user in ldap it falls back to the locally created user accounts.\nThe invalid user error hints that lookup in your ldap server is not returning the user account you try to authenticate with.\nEnable debugging in your ldap server:\ncreate a ldiff  file with theese lines\ndn: cn=config\nchangetype: modify\nreplace: olcLogLevel\nolcLogLevel: stats\n\nand import the ldif file to your ldap server with:\nldapadd -x -W -D 'cn=Manager,dc=pvpsc,dc=com' -f increaseverbosity.ldiff\n\nthis will log ldap queries made to your ldap on the the syslog of your server.\nuse the ldapsearch tool to search  your ldap server and read out the username of a user.\ncompare the successful log with the one created by the failed auth.\nwhat differs?

Edit the file and remove the goofy \"x-gvfs-name=Ubuntu\" part:\nmount -o remount,rw /\nnano /etc/fstab\n\nEdit, and save\nreboot\n\n\nA: @psusi, as you noted, the failed boot was due to the invalid option (\"x-gvfs-name=Ubuntu\") which was in the /etc/fstab file, and which I had caused to be entered as I described in the OP.  I was able to use the Ubuntu Live CD to get to this file and edit out the problem option by the following steps:  sudo fdisk -l THEN  sudo mkdir /mnt/harddrive THEN  sudo mount -t ext4 /dev/sde2 /mnt/harddrive THEN  sudo gedit /mnt/harddrive/etc/fstab. Sde2 is the location of the Ubuntu root found in fdisk.  In gedit, edit out the unwanted option, save, and reboot w/o Ubuntu Live CD.

Is there a DE-independent utility to show all windows beside each other in more lightweight DEs like Openbox, LXDE or Xfce?\nSomething like this: \n\n\nA: How about Skippy-XD? It is a full-screen task-switcher for X11 similar to Mac OS X's Exposé feature. \nFrom the above site:\n\nSkippy-XD is a standalone application for providing a window picker with live previews (including live video) on Linux desktops that run an X server with compositing support. That means it's not baked into the window manager, and the compositing is not being used all the time. So the performance of you're window manager isn't degraded, but you still get a window picker that's every bit as pretty as OSX's Exposé or KWin's \"Present Windows\", with all the desktop-navigational efficiency. Compositing only takes effect when you press the hotkey to display the window picker. \n\nI've tried it and it works well, though it doesn't include window decorations. \n\nTo install latest development packages (recommended), use the Skippy-XD PPA (daily). If you use Xfce, you can easily bind skippy-xd command to Alt + Tab or Alt + Esc in Settings > Keyboard > Shortcuts. For other DEs it should work similarly.\n\nBinding Skippy-XD to a screen corner\nYou can use xdotool to bind skippy-xd to a screen corner. First, make sure xdotool is installed:\nsudo apt-get install xdotool\n\nAdd the following line to your autostart applications:\nxdotool behave_screen_edge bottom-right exec skippy-xd\n\nValid location keys are:\nleft\ntop-left\ntop\ntop-right\nright\nbottom-left\nbottom\nbottom-right\n\nxdotool is very lightweight and should have next to no negative impact on your system.\nSource for the screen corner binding technique: \nhttp://urukrama.wordpress.com/2008/05/23/expose-type-behaviour-in-openbox/#comment-13674\n", "Q: Can't log in although password is correct Im fairly new to ubuntu so bear with me on this.

Why does Update Manager download full packages which already installed? For example, when there is an update for Firefox or Virtualbox or any other software, the Update Manager shows that it's downloading it from scratch.\n\nA: The package--that is, a single .deb file--is the smallest unit of information that Ubuntu's package manager can install. Even if some of the files in the package are the same as some of the files that already exists (which is often but not always the case when upgrading an already-installed package), the whole .deb file must still be downloaded.\nThis is not unique to Ubuntu, by the way. Most operating systems, Unix-like or not, usually download significant information during updates/upgrades that is already present on the system.\nSo, that's the reason. If you're trying to request a feature that this be changed, Ask Ubuntu is not the place for that. For this, try Brainstorm (please search first, as somone may have already posted the idea).\nJorge Castro has commented about a particular implementation of this feature. This may or may not be what you're thinking of (and is not necessarily the only way to achieve this), but is likely the most fruitful path toward the feature you're interested in.\n", "Q: How to force ubuntu touch to be in landscape on Nexus 7 I was wondering how I could force my Nexus 7 to run Ubuntu touch in landscape and have side-stages. \nCould anyone help me with this?\n\nA: Unfortunately not a very helpful answer, but:\nif you want to change it simply by doing some configuration edits it won't be possible. Quite a bit is yet hard coded and therefore it is clearly not yet the right time to start on this level. \nQuite a bit of work has to be done till there is a universal configuration to change the individual behaviour like roation or side-stage.\nI would say keep listening the different channels, like irc, mailinglist or the wiki and you will see when it will be possible.\n\nA: You can use this tutorial http://blog.wellsb.com/post/43774533626/side-stage-on-nexus-7-ubuntu-touch to enable side stage, but it's still in portrait.

Some applications still do, like Banshee. Alternating row colors would really help my application (written in python 2.7, and using gi.repository and not pygtk) that I'm developing.\nI know I can set a hint with \ntreeview.set_rules_hint(True)\n\nThis isn't working, however. Does anyone know how to enable the alternating row colors?\n\nA: Whether or not set_rules_hint(True) will display alternating row colors is up to the theme. With Ubuntu's default, Ambience, there will not be alternating rows. As the documentation states:\n\nDo not use it just because you prefer the appearance of the ruled\n  tree; that's a question for the theme. Some themes will draw tree rows\n  in alternating colors even when rules are turned off, and users who\n  prefer that appearance all the time can choose those themes. You\n  should call this function only as a semantic hint to the theme engine\n  that your tree makes alternating colors useful from a functional\n  standpoint (since it has lots of columns, generally).\n\nThat said, you can force it if your really want. For instance, this will work in Ambience:\nview.set_rules_hint(True)\nstyle_context = self.get_style_context()\ncss_provider = Gtk.CssProvider()\ncss = \"\"\"\n    GtkTreeView row:nth-child(even) {\n        background-color: shade(@base_color, 0.9);\n    }\n\n    GtkTreeView row:nth-child(odd) {\n        background-color: shade(@base_color, 1.0);\n    }\n    \"\"\"\ncss_provider.load_from_data(css.encode('UTF-8'))\nscreen = Gdk.Screen.get_default()\nstyle_context.add_provider_for_screen(screen, css_provider,\n                                  Gtk.STYLE_PROVIDER_PRIORITY_APPLICATION)\n\nThough you need to be aware that it might break in other themes.

I would love to triple-boot Windows XP Pro, Ubuntu 12.10, and Backtrack 5 R3, but is this safe for my harddrive/other OSs on the computer?\n\nA: This is perfectly safe, but you want to know what you're doing. Keep in mind that you may only have four primary partitions on each disk. With one partition for XP, and three total for your Linux partitions (two regular partitions for the system and one swap partition), you have four partitions and won't be able to safely add any more. If you do wind up deciding to add more partitions, you may consider keeping a few or all of your partitions in an extended partition. An extended partition is only a primary partition that can be divided up into (or \"contain\") several partitions, up to 64 of them. You can create one with GParted, make your system partitions, and install your operating systems to there.\nIf you definitely do not want to ever add any more partitions to your hard disk (you only mentioned one) other than what you will have, then you don't want to mess with extended partitions. Keep in mind that if you move the Windows partition to any other position, for example making it be the second partition on your hard disk rather than the first, then you will need to edit your C:\\NTLDR file to reflect the change. \nI recommend installing Windows first, or keeping it on the disk if it is already installed. This will probably save you some trouble, because one often has to deal with difficulties with partitioning in Windows. Then, from Ubuntu or Backtrack live media, resize the Windows partition so you have enough room for both Backtrack and Ubuntu. I would allow 7-10 GB for Backtrack, depending on what you want to do with it, and at least 25 to 50 GB for Ubuntu. Leave additional space in your Windows partition, too, of course. Now you want to actually create an empty partition on the end of your hard disk for Backtrack, optionally inserting your extended partition beforehand, and then install Backtrack to it. The install Ubuntu, which will recognize your unallocated space during the installation and give you the option to use it, creating a swap partition and an EXT4 system partition within it. If you already have Ubuntu installed, then simply shorten the EXT4 partition and move the swap partition to the left, and then create you Backtrack partition on the end and install it.\nOnce finished, if you already had Ubuntu installed and only wanted to add Backtrack, you will probably want to run boot-repair. In Ubuntu, you will be updating your kernel frequently, or at least more frequently than you will be in Backtrack, and you want Ubuntu to handle the updating of the Grub menu and Grub software package. If you installed Backtrack first and then Ubuntu, then Grub will already be handled by Ubuntu and you will have no need to run boot-repair. In the end, you will have the option to boot any of the three operating systems you have installed, as well as memtest, upon PC startup.\nI hope these suggestions and info helped (:\n\nA: Yes!  It's no harder than dual-booting.  Of course, just like with dual-booting, you'll need to decide the partitioning and which bootloader you want to use, but that's all nothing new.\nSo do you already have it set up to dual-boot?  If so, you just need to carve out some free space (from the Ubuntu installation, I'm guessing) to make room for Backtrack, and then go about the installation just as you normally would.  I'd suggest that when you get to the screen asking where to install it, you select \"Something else\" and choose the empty space you created.\n", "Q: DNS suddenly broken in Ubuntu VirtualBox My Ubuntu 12.04 VirtualBox (Windows 7 host) suddenly stopped connecting to remote servers unless I refer to them by their IP addresses.\nI'm looking for a way to fix this problem (or at least to troubleshoot it).\n\nNOTE: Neither restarting the VB nor restarting the host machine fixed the problem.\nIMPORTANT: The VB has been operating flawlessly since it was set up several months ago.  Furthermore, I did not make any changes to the configurations, settings, etc. of either the guest or the host machine in the last several days.

Without Wubi, you need to re-enlarge the Windows partition and restore the Windows bootloader. With Wubi, you just use the supplied uninstaller. You can even temporarily hide the Ubuntu entry from the Windows bootloader.\n\n*For someone who wants to try out Linux but is afraid of harming Windows, Wubi is less scary.\nCons\n\n\n*\n\n*Suppose a user has a computer with Wubi, has upgraded something but isn't sure what, is thousands of kilometers away, and phones you because his computer won't get past the bootloader stage. What next? There are far fewer resources about troubleshooting Wubi than with traditional Grub-based dual boot.\n\n*Similarly, if you need to troubleshooting or rescue the system with a live CD, Wubi reduces your options.\n\n*Increasing the size of the Wubi partition image wasn't supported last time I looked.\n\n*Wubi induces a small performance loss. (But if you're even considering Wubi, you probably don't care.)\n\n*If Windows screws up its filesystem, you lose Linux as well. (Though I get the feeling NTFS is reliable these days.)\n\n*Doesn't work with UEFI and if Windows 8 or above is preinstalled.\n\nRelated links:\n\n\n*\n\n*Ubuntu Wiki: Wubi Guide\n\n*AskUbuntu post: Can I install Ubuntu inside Windows?\n\n*AskUbuntu post: How to boot WUBI installed Ubuntu within Windows 8?\n\nA: Installing ubuntu on windows is safe.

If you ask this question on many sites, responders will simply tell you to do a web search.\nIf you were to check the manual page for gcc, you would find that the best way to deal with the specific issue of a deprecated function is to add\n-Wno-deprecated-declarations\nto the gcc command in order to just ignore that and still keep the safety of checking for all other warnings with -Wall\n\nA: Comment out the line containing g_type_init.

It has an SD card reader and a USB 3.0 port, but I  have neither an SD card nor a USB 3.0 flash drive!\nIf I were to boot from Ubuntu on one of those two devices, which would give me better performance? Which should I purchase?\nTo be clear, the devices I'm choosing from are:\n\n\n*\n\n*Class 10 SD card\n\n*USB 3.0 flash drive\n\n\nA: I think there is perhaps, I say perhaps, an over riding consideration on the selection.\nThe class level for the SD Card is there because it is basically saying these are the read/write speeds of the memory on the SD card.  It is not an IO speed limitation.  The USB stick issue/specification that is being sited is indeed the actual data transfer rate capability.  HOWEVER, it does NOT say anything about the capability of the actual media on the two sides of the USB interface.  So my thought on this is, we have to dig a little deeper!\nOn the USB stick is Flash Memory - basically the SAME memory types, with the same limitation as the memory on the SD Card.  So - this means that if the Memory on the USB 3 Memory Stick in Class 10 then that will be the limitation.  If the memory on the USB 3 stick is Class 2 then that will be the limitation.  Basically - we can NOT assume that because the interface is USB 3 that the transfer rate will be the same as the USB 3 specification - in this case.  I would also submit that if Memory, for use on a USB stick was actually much faster - then it would very likely be available on an SD card - as Class X (super fast).\n\nA: A USB 3.0 Flash Drive is almost always preferable to an SD Card when booting an OS. The thing about booting Operating Systems is that 4K Read/Write Speed dictate the experience more than the sequential Read/Write Speed (the usual advertised speed).\nUnfortunately, most USB manufacturers don't give a baseline speed for 4K Read/Write and the only thing SD Cards have to have is a minimal sequential write speed (the Speed Classes 4,6,10, etc).\nTherefor, you have to test the drives you want to use yourself using bench-marking software (such as CrystalDiskMark, etc).\nGenerally speaking, any USB 3.0 Flash Drive from a fairly reputable manufacturer will easily outperform any SD Card in both Sequential and 4K Read/Writes. In my experiences I've had MicroSD Cards that struggled to even reach the Speed Classes! One last thing for other people to consider is the available amount of USB ports and their Generation. You might find that your computer may only have 1 or 2 USB ports, so you wouldn't have room for other peripherals.\nP.S I have found that Amazon reviews for any particular Flash Drive/SD Card usually contain some Benchmarks to gauge overall performance.\n\nA: I would like to answer about transfer rate.\nTransfer rate for:\nSD Card\n\nUSB 3.0\nThere are currently three speed modes defined by the latest USB 3.0 specification. They are SuperSpeed, Hi-Speed and Full-Speed.\nThe new SuperSpeed mode has a transfer rate of 4.8Gbps (600 MB/sec). While the specification retains Hi-Speed and Full-Speed USB mode, commonly known as USB 2.0 and 1.1 respectively, the slower modes still operate at 480Mbps (60 MB/sec) and 12Mbps (1.5 MB/sec) respectively and are kept to maintain backward compatibility. Check out this page for a comparison between USB 3.0 and other competing interfaces such as eSATA, FireWire 800 and Thunderbolt. \nI suggest you to use flash drive to boot.\n", "Q: Autohide Unity Launcher in Gnome Classic I am using the Unity launcher in the Gnome Classic desktop.

There is a landscape client charm: http://jujucharms.com/charms/precise/landscape-client\n\n*For each node, manually do one of these alternatives using SSH login: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/AutomaticSecurityUpdates#Using_the_.22unattended-upgrades.22_package (easiest is probably just to run \"sudo dpkg-reconfigure unattended-upgrades\" and answer yes on all nodes)\nThis might be discussed here: https://blueprints.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+spec/security-r-juju-charms.\nWhishlist:\n\n\n*\n\n*Global environment/service/machine option to do automatic updates\n\n*Unattended updates subordinate charm to associate with nodes I want to automatically update.

I just installed 12.04 and can not watch YouTube. \nI was advised to install \"Ubuntu restricted extras\" from Ubuntu Software Center. But, during the installation, I got the warning that Libav codec library ( libav codec 53 )   and Libav utility Library ( libav util 51 )  should be removed before installing \"Restricted Extras\". \nHow do I go about removing these libraries? Thank You for Your patience.\n\nA: You can use synaptic as a Graphical User Interface (How to install Synaptic Package Manager?) or the commandline to find and uninstall these libraries.\nIn the commandline do apt-cache search libav. See what libraries are found and remove (or purge) these as follows sudo apt-get remove packageName where you replace packageName with the results you found and want to delete.\nAfter the removal you might want to run sudo apt-get update and sudo apt-get autoremove. Note that any software depending on libav might either no longer be fully functional or might be removed.\nEnjoy an libav-free system.\n", "Q: How can I convert video to DivX4 to play on my Kogan TV? I want to convert some videos to play on my Kogan TV using a portable hard-drive, but I am having trouble getting it to work. Most of my avi files, encoded using as xvid, all come up as 'unsupported file' on the TV.\nThe only file that I've found that works is reported as being the following by file:\ntest.avi:  RIFF (little-endian) data, AVI, 640 x 464, 23.98 fps, video: DivX 4, audio: MPEG-1 Layer 3 (stereo, 48000 Hz)\n\nBut I can't seem to work out a suitable avconv command line to convert anything else to that format.\nThe TV claims to support (from here):\n\nAVI (MPEG - 1/2 and MPEG-4 divx 4 coded) and MP4 (MPEG - 1/2 and MPEG-4 divx 4 coded)\n\n\nA: It turns out that I just needed to trick the TV into thinking it was the DivX codec when it is really the xvid codec, by changing the video tag (or FourCC to DIVX) using -tag:v DIVX:\navconv -i input.mp4 -c:v libxvid -c:a libmp3lame -b 700k -tag:v DIVX output.avi\n\nWhich seems to be acceptable to the TV, and file now outputs similar to my good video:\noutput.avi: RIFF (little-endian) data, AVI, 640 x 480, 25.00 fps, video: DivX 4, audio: MPEG-1 Layer 3 (stereo, 44100 Hz)\n\n\nA: Some media players don't support Divx format but can read Xvid\nIn my case, i used avconv to set the correct tag and let my media player read it as Xvid and not Divx :\n$ avconv -i input.avi -vtag Xvid -c:a copy -c:v copy output.avi\n\nAfter that :\n$ file input.avi\ninput.avi: RIFF (little-endian) data, AVI, 640 x 360, 23.98 fps, video: DivX 4, audio: MPEG-1 Layer 3 (stereo, 48000 Hz)\n$ file output.avi\noutput.avi: RIFF (little-endian) data, AVI, 640 x 360, 23.98 fps, video: XviD, audio: MPEG-1 Layer 3 (stereo, 48000 Hz)\n\n", "Q: Is there a fancy vertical notification OSD that works for both ALSA and pulseaudio? Is there a fancy way to get the volume notification OSD to work with both pulseaudio and ALSA? Right now the standard desktop ones only work with pulseaudio for me. How about a vertical OSD that I can use as a drop in replacement or call from the command line to report changes in arbitrary percentages graphically, as a bar that moves up and down?\nThe reason why I need it to work with both ALSA and pulseaudio is that I'm using a WINE application which doesn't play well with pulse, so I kill pulse before starting up the Windows app to use ALSA without the extra abstraction layer. When I realized that the volume keys on my keyboard didn't work without pulse, I wrote some bash scripts that I call with either Compiz or Openbox (configured through CCSM and lxde-rc.xml, respectively) to catch the exit signal from pulseaudio --check and then adjust the volume accordingly:\nvol_step_up\n#!/bin/bash\npulseaudio --check\nif [ $? -eq 0 ] ; then\n        pactl set-sink-volume 0 -- +3db\n    else\n        amixer -c0 set Master playback 3+\nfi\n\nvol_step_down\n#!/bin/bash\npulseaudio --check\nif [ $? -eq 0 ] ; then\n        pactl set-sink-volume 0 -- -3db\n    else\n        amixer -c0 set Master playback 3-\nfi\n\nThe scripts work great and map to the buttons just fine, but I don't have a good way of seeing the visual feedback anymore--not even with the pulseaudio ones since I' m catching the button events (XF86AudioLowerVolume, etc.). Obviously I could just map the ALSA volume keys to something else, but there's no sense in duplicating shortcut keys.\nI did find a python volume control that I can call in the scripts above:https://github.com/fishman/utils/blob/master/pvol.py\npvol.py -s shows the current volume level on screen for both ALSA and pulseaudio, but it's awfully tiny compared to the gnome OSD I had been using, and it isn't vertical (bar on top, old OSD at bottom):\n\nSo, I made it bigger and flopped it around:\n\nBut, even with switching the orientation to a vertical one, the blue default GTK theme isn't quite as slick as VLC (see below).\nMuch of what I've found in searching for OSD implementations are posts about notify-send commands which lack the whole progress bar concept. Otherwise, it's mostly horizontal bars (and lots of counting placeholders within bash scripts). Really all I need to do is call amix & pactl, so something simple like the gtk progress bar in pvol.py would be great--just not so blue and not right in the middle of the screen.\nVLC has a good example of what I have in mind when you scroll the mouse wheel in full-screen mode: \n\nIt's a lot less obstructive than the usual boxes that sit in the center of the screen:\n\nThe whole horizontal slider analogy has never made much sense to me outside of panning audio between the left and right speakers.\nAnyway, how is it that the default desktop notifications get called (especially LXDE)? I see a lot of posts about configuring key press events, but not much on what scripts those events trigger. What other options are out there in the vertically fancy department?\nAlso, is there some package I should uninstall to prevent conflicts from springing up between the events I'm handling through scripting and compiz or openbox commands?\nUpdate: For the sake of figuring out what OSD I'm currently using, I didn't change the way I handle the mute button right away. Killing xfce4-notifyd and then pressing the mute button spawns a new xfce4-notifyd process, so I was guessing the big speaker icon came from something like xfce4-volumed, but I don't actually have that package installed...Ah ha! Killing gnome-settings-daemon stops the big OSD in the center of the screen.\n\nA: Alright, at the risk of answering my own question, I came up with a bit of a hacked together pyqt version of pvol from the link in the question above. If nothing else, maybe someone else can improve on my code. Eventually, I plan to either get rid of the parts in the script below which go unused or to take the bash scripts out of the equation and have one pyqt script handle all of the button events. Right now, the OSD times out at a constant rate from the first button press instead of staying on for a fixed amount of time after the last button press.\nJust copy, paste and save the files (with the names in bold), put them all in the same directory, set the executable bits, and modify the system calls in the pyqt script according to wherever you save them, or put them all in directory that's in your path. Then map the shell scripts to Compiz commands, Openbox shortcuts, or something similar, and change the pyqt script if you're not using multimedia keyboard volume buttons.\nNote: The class name Qvol was a working title, and I didn't bother to change it. Please also note that the mute button goes unhandled--This is just a prototype to express a possible avenue for fulfilling the requested features, and it is not currently associated with any kind of hosted project or standard development model. Any kind of significant development derived from the code below should probably belong on Sourceforge, GitHub or a project website. That said, feel free to edit this answer or to suggest an existing project which allows is similar in function and design.\n\nvol_step_down\n#!/bin/bash\npulseaudio --check\n#if [ $? -ne 0 ] ; then\nif [ $? -eq 0 ] ; then\n        pactl set-sink-volume 0 -- -3db\n    else\n        amixer -c0 set Master playback 3-\nfi\n\nif [ -z \"$1\" ] ; then\n        pqvol -s\nfi\n\nvol_step_up\n#!/bin/bash\npulseaudio --check\n#if [ $? -ne 0 ] ; then\nif [ $? -eq 0 ] ; then\n        pactl set-sink-volume 0 -- +3db\n    else\n        amixer -c0 set Master playback 3+\nfi\n\nif [ -z \"$1\" ] ; then\n    pqvol -s\nfi\n\npqvol\n#!/usr/bin/env python2\n\n# pvol -- Commandline audio volume utility\n#         with an optional GTK progressbar\n# Copyright (C) 2009 Adrian C. <anrxc_sysphere_org>\n# Modified by 2011 Reza Jelveh\n# Ported to pyqt and renamed to pqvol 2013 by Adam R.\n\n# This program is free software; you can redistribute it and/or modify\n# it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by\n# the Free Software Foundation; either version 2 of the License, or\n# (at your option) any later version.\n\n\nimport os.path\nimport optparse\nimport alsaaudio\nimport sys\nfrom PyQt4 import QtGui, QtCore\nfrom PyQt4.QtCore import QTimer\n\nappname = \"Qvol\"\n#appicon = \"/usr/share/icons/ubuntu-mono-light/status/24/audio-volume-high-panel.svg\"\n\nDEFAULT_STYLE = \"\"\"\nQProgressBar{\n    border: 2px solid grey;\n    border-radius: 5px;\n    background-color: transparent;\n}\n\nQProgressBar::chunk {\n    background-color: Gainsboro;\n}\n\"\"\"\n\nclass AlsaMixer():\n    def __init__(self, pcm=False, mute=False, arg=None):\n        self.mixer = alsaaudio.Mixer()\n        self.percent = self.mixer.getvolume()[0]\n        print self.percent\n        self.label = \"dB\" #% name\n        if arg:\n            self.percent = min(100, max(0, self.percent + int(arg)))\n            self.mixer.setvolume(self.percent)\n        if mute:\n            mutestate = self.mixer.getmute()[0]\n            if mutestate:\n                self.label = \"Unmuted: \"\n            else:\n                self.label = \"Muted: \"\n\n            self.mixer.setmute(mutestate^1)\n #     self.label = self.label + \"%.0f%%\" % self.percent\n\nclass Qvol(QtGui.QWidget):\n\n    def __init__(self):\n        super(Qvol, self).__init__()\n#       self.setWindowFlags(QtCore.Qt.WindowStaysOnTopHint)\n        self.setWindowFlags(QtCore.Qt.FramelessWindowHint)\n        self.setWindowFlags(QtCore.Qt.Popup)\n        self.setAttribute(QtCore.Qt.WA_TranslucentBackground)\n        self.setWindowTitle(\"Qvol\")\n        self.initUI()\n\n    def initUI(self):     \n\n        self.pbar = QtGui.QProgressBar(self)\n        self.pbar.setGeometry(5, 5, 20, 470)\n        self.pbar.setOrientation(QtCore.Qt.Vertical)\n        self.pbar.setRange(0,100)\n        volume = AlsaMixer()\n        self.pbar.setValue(volume.percent)\n        self.pbar.setTextVisible(False)\n        self.setStyleSheet(DEFAULT_STYLE)\n\n        self.setGeometry(1260, 180, 30, 480)\n        self.setWindowTitle('QtGui.QProgressBar')\n        self.show()\n\n\n        QTimer.singleShot(2000, finished)\n\n    def keyPressEvent(self, event):\n        if event.key()==QtCore.Qt.Key_VolumeMute:\n#           QtGui.QWidget.paintEvent()\n            finished()\n        elif event.key()==QtCore.Qt.Key_VolumeDown:\n            launch_process (\"vol_step_down silent\")\n            volume=AlsaMixer()\n            self.pbar.setValue(volume.percent)\n#           finished()\n        elif event.key()==QtCore.Qt.Key_VolumeUp:\n            launch_process (\"vol_step_up silent\")\n            volume=AlsaMixer()\n            self.pbar.setValue(volume.percent)\n#           finished()\n\n#       else:\n#           QtGui.QWidget.keyPressEvent(self, event)\n\n\nprocesses = set([])\n\ndef launch_process(process):\n    # Do something asynchronously\n    proc = QtCore.QProcess()\n    processes.add(proc)\n    proc.start(process)\n    proc.waitForFinished(-1)\n\ndef finished():\n    print \"The process is done!\"\n    # Quit the app\n    QtCore.QCoreApplication.instance().quit()\n\n\ndef main():\n\n    app = QtGui.QApplication(sys.argv)\n    ex = Qvol()\n    sys.exit(app.exec_())\n\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    main()  \n\n", "Q: Is there an alternative to Softaculous AMPPS?

Try to resize a partition. NTFS partitions are also recognized in Ubuntu, so you can keep your data on those kinds of partitions.\n\nA: First, I would strongly recommend you to set your Windows pagefile to a fixed size (min = max) and then reduce the size of Windows partition (C:) as much as you can (or about 10 GB larger that the present used space) using the Disk management Tool in Windows. Otherwise you may have problems with booting Windows via Grub bootloader which will be installed with Ubuntu.\nSecond, you can then boot your Ubuntu live CD/DVD/USB in \"try without installing\" mode and start GParted Partition Editor there to make partitions before Ubuntu installation (although this is performed at the beginning of the installation, I find it better doing this in advance). At his stage, considering that you can have maximun 4 Primary Partitions in a disk, you might need to create an Extended Partition in which you can have as many Logical Partitions as you might need. A Data partition to use jointly with Windows may be in NTFS format (with an appropriate entry in Ubuntu system file /etc/fstab), about 20GB Ubuntu partition and about 4GB swap partition, etc. \n", "Q: Not able to run juju bootstrap : ERROR You are not allowed to start up this node Trying to install MaaS server with juju using 12.10 ubuntu.

Numbers 2 and 3 can be fixed by\n  installing or reinstalling FreeSpace 2.\" at graphics/2d.cpp:645\n\n\nA: Introduction\nThere can be a number of complications when setting up FreeSpace 2 Open (FS2Open) on an Ubuntu system. The original retail Freespace 2 game data is still needed, as the FS2Open files in part provide a way of playing the game on modern Linux based (and other) systems. As the official game forums is the place to go for a more general guide on running the game, I will concentrate on addressing how to compile the launcher and then how to start the game on Ubuntu. \nA compiled binary of FS2Open (but not the launcher) is hosted at the official site and also here, though these links will change for later versions.\nInitial Problems\n1) We have already partly solved some problems in the comments:\n\n\n*\n\n*If you have problems with shared libraries, run ldd ./name_of_fs2_binary to see if everything is being found. If not, and if you are on a 64 bit system, you may need to install the i386 version of the package, with, for example,  \nsudo apt-get install liblua5.1-0:i386\n\n\n*The first run of the FS2Open binary (whether errors are encountered or not) will create ~/.fs2_open/fs2_open.ini, where important graphics settings will be stored, and can be edited manually or set with the wxlauncher (see below). They must be set properly by one or the other method however.\nMain Problem\nHowever, to solve the final issues with the game not starting up, it is probably easiest to compile and use wxlauncher, rather than manually creating a startup script.\nIf the launcher is to work after compiling and installing, you must have:\n\n\n*\n\n*installed the original Freespace 2 data files from your retail copy of the game correctly and ensured that the permissions are correct. For more information, see the official game forums. It is important to say that all files must be lowercase or the game will not find them and you will get errors.\n\n*moved the downloaded FreeSpace 2 Open binary to the top level of the game folder (/home/$USER/games/FreeSpace2 for example).\n\n*installed openal; however, if you decide to configure the game setup manually and not use the launcher, you will still need to install openal with \nsudo apt-get install libopenal1\n\n\nCompilation and Installation\nNow, to the compilation and installation of the launcher.\nDownload the appropriate source code package from the official site and check the sha1 signature with sha1sum. \nAs usual, quite a few dependencies are necessary. The usual packages can be installed with:\nsudo apt-get install cmake build-essential checkinstall\n\nThe specific packages that are necessary can be installed with:\nsudo apt-get install python python-dev python-markdown libwxgtk2.8-dev libwxbase2.8-dev libopenal1 libopenal-dev wx2.8-headers wx-common wx2.8-examples wx2.8-i18n libsdl1.2-dev libsdl1.2debian\n\nThese are the package names on 12.04, but they should be the same for 12.10. The readme included with the download notes that the version of wxWidgets should be 2.8.10+, but not 2.9.x.\nUsing terminal, cd to your download folder and run\ntar -xzvf wxLauncher-0.9.1.tar.gz\n\nNow, cd to wxLauncher-0.9.1 and, because this is a cmake build, we usually now create a build folder and move to that:\nmkdir build && cd build\n\nNext configure the build with \ncmake .. -DUSE_OPENAL=1\n\n(For a debug build add, -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug)\nI found that another compile flag specified in the readme included with the download wasn't necessary, as when the program was installed with checkinstall and then run, that particular error did not occur and all the launcher's files were being found correctly.\nNow, run make to compile the program, and then from the same directory (build), run \nsudo checkinstall --pkgname=wxlauncher --provides=wxlauncher\n\nand keep pressing return to accept the other defaults.\nNow type wxlauncher and you will be able to specify the path of your FreeSpace 2 main folder with the game data and with the downloaded FS2Open binary. You can also set your options and launch the game (screenshots below):\n\nMake sure that you select the correct freespace 2 folder; the options will appear when the binary is detected. Click refresh and click the box again if it isn't detected.\n\n\nA: I solved this problem by installing the lua.i386 package. Then, I made a link to liblua-5.1.so in /usr/lib, named liblua5.1.so.0.\nsudo apt-get install liblua5.1-0:i386\n\nThen, run\nsudo ln -s /usr/lib/liblua-5.1.so /usr/lib/liblua5.1.so.0\n\n\nA: Thanks for the procedure - worked great for me. I had one other problem with the libjansson4 package - the launcher started up just fine, but when I ran FS2, I got \"package not found errors.\"\nI had to run \"sudo apt-get install libjansson4:i386\" to resolve the problem. \nI also wanted to add that I was having trouble building the GTK yal launcher. After installing the packages recommended for building wxlauncher, it built fine. \n", "Q: What about \"Write apps for all Ubuntu devices \" on http://www.ubuntu.com/devices/phone/app-ecosystem ubuntu writes about creating one app for all devices, seperated only by the currently offered UI ( Tablet, Phone, Desktop ).\nDue desktop apps are using quickly for development (gtk-based) and phone and tablet are using qml (qt-based), I really wonder how I should start porting a user interface for an existing native application.\nWether I created the core-application in quickly or as a commandline (which should be an advantage comparing to the quickly-solution I guess) I don't have a clue to extend this existing app to offer a phone/tablet interface if needed.\nAnd how should I start if I want to write an app that shall be available on each form factor? I mean one core app and two or three UIs.\nBoth would be very interesting for me to understand how I can plan my development without having the need and anger of rewriting/multiplying the core of the app to work on all form factors.\nThanks for advice and if such information exists, post a link on the above page so a developer can get information about writing multi-platform apps.\nRegards\nAndré\n\nA: Writing your application in QT (especially QML 2.0) seems to be the only supported way on Ubuntu Touch right now.

I actually want to use my mobile to download updates as my internet is not so fast and I have to keep my computer running for a long time to install them. I want to download them in my mobile and then install later by transferring them to computer.\n\nA: For a situation like the one you described, I think that synaptic will be appropriate for your purpose.\n(I had the same scenario you described, dial up connection at home, and high speed connection at my office.)\n\nShort Version\nUse synaptic to create a shell script in the slow machine. Run the script in the fast machine to download packages. Copy back the downloaded packages to the slow machine. Use synaptic to install the packages.\n\nLong Version\nIf synaptic is not installed in your machine, you will have to install it.\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get install synaptic\n\nI understand that your computer has very slow speed. But I hope that it can cope with the update and around 2500 K download for the above installation. \nStart synaptic,\nsudo synaptic\n\nYou get the opening window of synaptic. Select the files you want to install using the Search function.\n\nMarks the packages you want to select, either left mouse click or right mouse menu-select.\nFinish marking all the packages you want.\n\nFrom the File menu generate the download script.\n\nSave the script at some convenient location. Use any file name you like. Let us say your \nname is mydownloads.sh\n\nIf you close synaptic, you can ignore the warning about not installed packages.\nThe script is a simple shell script, containing a series of wget commands, like the following,\n#!/bin/sh\nwget -c http://archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/pool/universe/c/cadubi/cadubi_1.3-2_all.deb\n\nCopy the script to your mobile, start a terminal, move to the directory where\nyou copied the script and run it there. \nsudo ./mydownloads.sh\n\nPlease remember that wget needs to be installed in that device. If it is not installed, install\nsudo apt-get install wget \n\nOnce finished running the script (it may take some time depending on the Internet speed and volume of download), you will get a number of .deb files in the directory from where you run the script. Copy those files back to your computer and run synaptic again.\nsudo synaptic\n\nFrom the file menu, use the Add downloaded package function to select the directory in your computer where you copied the downloaded files.\n\nClick on Apply. Installation of your downloaded packages should go without any problem.\n\nFrom time to time, you will need to run \nsudo apt-get update\n\nat your slow speed machine, select Mark All Upgrades in synaptic and then go through the process of generating the script, download the files at your high speed machine, and \nthen install the downloaded files to keep the slow machine upgraded.\n\n\nA: Keryx is one possible solution to your problem.\nWith Keryx you can decide what to download (updates included) and then download them on another computer.\n\nIf Keryx doesn't work as advertised, there is a step by step procedure for using Keryx v0.92.4.1\n", "Q: Is an Acer C7 Chromebook worth buying as an Ubuntu netbook? I apologies for non technical question. I'm really low on budget, and considering buying new netbook for starting using Ubuntu, after a lame Win 8 decided to move on Linux based systems. So for the starter I want to move on Ubuntu  step by step. I choosed Acer C7 Chromebook mostly for it's price, and seem all technical characteristics are enough to run Ubuntu.\nI've read a lot of reviews on Acer C7 with chrUbuntu, but still have some question.

So what's going to happen with 13.04? Does this Acer C7 worth buying as Ubuntu netbook? Appreciate your advices.\n\nA: The short answer is no, C7 Chromebook is not worth buying as Ubuntu netbook.\nFirst, Chromebooks uses its own kind of BIOS replacement that is not supported by Ubuntu. So it won't boot.\nSecond, chrUbuntu is not an official version of Ubuntu and is off topic in this site. \nThird, Ubuntu 13.04 is not out yet and as a future version of Ubuntu is off topic as well. As far as I know there is not plans for supporting Chromebook, but I may be wrong.\nFourth, Shopping recommendations are off topic.\nHope this helps\n", "Q: I am having difficulties reinstalling 12.10 and need help My reinstall of Ubuntu 12.10 seems to be taking forever.

How do I change directories to downloads, from the home folder, in the latest version Ubuntu 12.10? I tried cd /downloads, but it gave an error saying that there is no such directory.\n\nA: From the Downloads directory, you can quickly return to your home directory by simply typing cd at the prompt. cd ~ does the same thing.\nThere two basic ways to get around in BASH:\n\n\n*\n\n*Using absolute pathnames\n\n*Using relative pathnames\n\n\nAbsolute pathnames start at the root directory, denoted by a leading /, and can be used from anywhere. To use the absolute path to go to Downloads, you can run:\ncd /home/<username>/Downloads\n\nwhere <username> is replaced with your username. You can also replace it with the environment variable $USER which usually expands to the username of the user currently running the shell. You can also replace /home/<username> with $HOME, which will usually expand to the absolute path of the home directory of the user running the shell. \nA useful shortcut for this is \ncd ~/Downloads\n\nThe tilde character (~) takes the place of /home/<username> - it expands to the home directory of the user currently running the shell. Note that this expansion will not be performed if the tilde character is in double or single quotes.\nRelative pathnames start at the working directory (the one you're in). So if you know what directory you're in, you can use some shortcuts to get around. For example\n\n\n*\n\n*. (dot) refers to the current working directory\n\n*.. (dot)(dot) refers to the parents directory of the current working directory\n\n\nwhen you are in your Home folder and type cd Downloads you could also type ./Downloads\nThe ./ is implied when you just type cd Downloads (working directory is implied if you don't include a pathname).\nWhen you are in the Downloads directory, you could also use cd .. to return to the parent directory /home/<username>. In this case it is easiest to just type cd, because that changes the working directory your home directory immediately wherever you are. However, the .. becomes very useful when you are navigating around nested directory structures or other locations on the system.\n\nA: cd ~/Downloads\n\nRemember: Linux is case sensitive, so Downloads and downloads are different directories.\n~ is a \"shortcut\" to the home directory. Another one would be $HOME. If you're already in your home directory you can just cd Downloads.\n\nA: You can also shorten typing by using aliases in .bash_aliases which is in your home directory. In this example, typing dwn would take you to your Download directory.\nalias dwn='cd /home/andy/Downloads'\n\n", "Q: Why won't Ubuntu use my ethernet cable?

I just need to install kernel 3.4 (or higher stable version) on my machine (with 8GB RAM) running Ubuntu 11.10. I did the following steps:\n\n\n*\n\n*I downloaded the following DEB files:\nlinux-headers-3.4.0-030400_3.4.0-030400.201205210521_all.deb\nlinux-headers-3.4.0-030400-generic-pae_3.4.0-030400.201205210521_i386.deb\nlinux-image-3.4.0-030400-generic-pae_3.4.0-030400.201205210521_i386.deb\n\n\n*I installed them by,\nsudo dpkg -i *.deb\n\n\n*I restarted the machine and I selected kernel 3.4 from GRUB menu.

I only get no VNC server up and running, although it's configured for the VM.\nMaybe this is a firewall problem since I can connect locally.\n\nA: VNC support should be available by default. So as you said there may be a problem in firewall or qemu/libvirt configuration.\nRegarding qemu by default it only accepts local vnc connections. To change that edit /etc/libvirt/qemu.conf:\nvnc_listen = \"0.0.0.0\"\n\nThis will enable connections from all hosts, which depending what you are trying to do can be very dangerous. In that file you can find more info on how to secure things up.\nAlso, if you use libvirt I think it also only accepts local connections by default. To enable remote access edit /etc/libvirt/libvirtd.conf:\nlisten_tcp = 1\n\nThe same security concerns regarding qemu apply here. See how to secure the connection if needed here.\nAs a last resort check if the ports used by vnc and libvirt are open. In the case you are using ufw:\nsudo ufw status verbose\n\n\nA: KVM (QEMU) has a built-in VNC server, and it works by default. It can be enabled in several ways.

I run Ubuntu 12.10 up to date on it.\nBefore a week or two I used to enjoy more that 5 hours of battery life, especially when watching movies with VLC and hardware accelerated playback. I can't link my issue to some update I did but for several days now and after about 2 to 3 hours, my laptop shutdown abruptly without warning for critical nor low battery level.\nI suspect this is battery related since the battery charge curve show that the battery charge plummets from 50-40% to 0% before the shutdowns. Upon reboot, I have to run a \"killall Xorg\" since the greeter won't load and drop me to something like a black console with lines about battery I can't remember on top of my head right now and an arrow cursor.\nAfter a while, usually 1 to 3 minutes, the laptop shutdown again.\nI can't pinpoint the component that cause this. I know it's a software problem since after such an event I can't run it for at least 1h30 in Windows without issues. I lost patience after that but it reported still 1h of autonomy when I powered it off.\nAny hint on how to solve or at least identify the culprit ? Any log I can check maybe ?\nThanks.\n\nA: It's probably a calibration problem. I used to face a somewhat similar problem on my laptop too. Back when I was using Windows 10, I used to enjoy about 4 to 5 hours of battery life and after switching to Ubuntu, my battery life came down to about 3 hours. I did some research online and found tons of advice, but none of them seemed to be as effective as recalibrating. Here's what you gotta do...\n\n\n*\n\n*Charge your laptop to 100% and let it remain plugged in for about 30 to 40 minutes.\n\n*After that, unplug it and make sure to use your laptop until it shuts down \n\n*After this try switching it on, if it doesn't switch on, then well and good. However, if it does switch on, then that would mean that there is still some charge left in your battery. \n\n*Make sure that your battery is fully drained. \n\n*Wait for up to 2 to 3 hours and then plug it back in and let it charge all the way up to 100 percent. \n\n\nAfter this you should be good. This is a manual recalibration. This will probably fix your inaccurate battery meter readings. \n\nA: I had the same issue in a Dell laptop when running Windows and Linux\nTo get basic values about the battery performance, use in Linux\nacpitool -B\n\nor in windows \nPowercfg -energy\n\nBoth commands can give you a lot of info about power consumption check man acpitool and powercfg /h\nWhat I think is the problem is that the OS Bios Hardware it is not getting the right charge value from the battery, since this is hard to get usually this info is stored by the OS from calculations in the Bios and hardware when some power fluctuation introduce a bug (safety battery protection will always avoid overcharge)\nUsually Calibrating the battery will fix the problem, to reset the process is to do a full charge without interruptions and later a full battery discharge, if it's possible let the laptop in some stable power situation, while you are not using it and avoiding that enter into auto hibernation, sleep etc, some laptops have a utility or the manufacturer recommend a special procedure to reset the battery.\n\nA: I suggest changing your power setting to \"do nothing\" at critical.  This way an erroneous reading will not shut down your system.\nAlt + F2 and launch dconf-editor\n--you will need to install this if you don't already have it: sudo apt-get install dconf-editor\nNavigate to org.gnome.settings-daemon.plugins.power and change the critical-battery-action to interactive or do nothing (this is for 16.04)\nThis does not fix the bug, but mitigates the impact.  If your computer is not really at critical, just tell it to do nothing an continue.\n\nA: The previous answer for changing power setting to \"do nothing\" at critical doesn't seem to apply for Ubuntu 20.04 (that dconf setting no longer exists).  To achieve that, you will have to edit /etc/UPower/UPower.conf and set PercentageAction=0 and TimeAction=0\nA cleaner approach would probably be to set CriticalPowerAction to None or Suspend but this feature was rejected\nRelevant discussion\n\n*\n\n*https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/upower/upower/-/issues/41\n\n*https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/upower/upower/-/merge_requests/40\n\n*https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/upower/+bug/1852911\n\n*https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/upower/upower/-/issues/59\n", "Q: Where have the full package descriptions gone? Once upon a time, if I wanted to know what a particular (uninstalled) packages was for, I could go\napt-cache show <package>\nand it would produce a slew of information, including a good couple of paragraphs describing the package.\nThis has changed recently.  Now the \"Description\" field is only ever one line.\nOn an older, system, It goes:\nmslade@natty1:~$ apt-cache show apt\n[snip]\nDescription: Advanced front-end for dpkg\n This is Debian's next generation front-end for the dpkg package manager.\n It provides the apt-get utility and APT dselect method that provides a\n simpler, safer way to install and upgrade packages.\n .\n APT features complete installation ordering, multiple source capability\n and several other unique features, see the Users Guide in apt-doc.\n\nAnd now:\nmslade@mickpc:~$ apt-cache show apt\n[snip]\nDescription: commandline package manager\n\nThe long descriptions are still in the package files, and you can query them with dpkg -s if you've already installed them, but this isn't helpful if you just want to know more about some package that was mentioned on some web site.\nI have searched everywhere for some source for these descriptions.  The best I have some up with so far is, download the .deb file and run dpkg-deb -I on it.  This is really overkill if all you want is the metadata.\nIs there a better way?\nUpdate: I just installed a new pangolin VM and noticed its apt-cache show gave long descriptions, until i fudged /etc/apt/sources.list to use my own mirror, produced with debmirror.  I suspect debmirror is the culprit.\n\nA: This sounds like you have something like\nAcquire::Languages { \"none\"; };\n\nsomewhere in /etc/apt/apt.conf.d/\nReplace it by\nAcquire::Languages { \"environment\"; };\n\nor \nAcquire::Languages { \"en\"; };\n\nYou may need to run\napt-get update\n\nto download to corresponding translation files (/var/lib/apt/lists/*Translation-*)\n\nA: Passing --i18n to debmirror has fixed this.\nThis is an ubuntu quirk.  Debian's Packages files contain the long english descriptions, ubuntu has pulled them out into Translation-en files.  debmirror assumes you only need translation files if you want something besides english, so it doesn't mirror any by default.\n(Is this worth keeping as a question/answer?)\n", "Q: Installing ubuntu 12.10 - performance issues First question ever, well I'm trying to install ubuntu 12.10 in my laptop, however its laggy, slow, can't do anything, can barely install it.\nTryed with wubi, didn't work so well, went for a usb install, my partition table wasn't able to create a partition, now I'm doing it manually and will try to install again.\neven tested with Kubunto to ditch unity, still slow, unbearable, taking 5 mins to open anything.\nI dont know what the problem is, my laptop meets the requirements, i think.\nspecs:\ngeforce 240m     \n4gb ram\nintel core 2 duo t9600 2.8ghz\n\nWhat do you guys think, really need to study a but in Ubuntu (bash and c pipes bah), is it the fail graphics card? anything that i should be doing?\nthanks in advance\nRoger\n(sorry for bad english)\n\nA: First, a note - anything installed with Wubi is going to be slow, due to the way Wubi works.\nThat said, it might be worth running a diagnostic of your hard drive, if the install was also slow. Very often a major slowdown, especially in a clean OS install, is indicative of a hard drive going bad. I recommend Hitachi's Drive Fitness Test, Hiren's Boot CD, or the Ultimate Boot CD.\nThere's a difference between graphics-related slowness and slowness related to other issues. Generally, graphics slowness is lag in repainting actions, such as changing screens or scrolling through long documents. If you see this kind of slowness, too, make sure you've installed the Nvidia drivers. You can do this by first updating your computer (open Unity and search \"update\"), which also updates your video driver list. Once the updates are done, open the \"Software sources\" application and go to the \"Additional Drivers\" tab. Find the Nvidia driver that says either \"stable\" or \"stable, tested\" and select it.\nOn a final note, your specs are more than enough to run Ubuntu with Unity, Gnome-Shell, or KDE (also, KDE is on par with Unity as far as resource usage, so it's not surprising that going to Kubuntu didn't change anything), but if you want something lighter weight, then you might want to try LXDE (Lubuntu) or OpenBox. Also, the terminal isn't generally required in most cases for the general user anymore, but even when you do make use of it, it's not that bad (and who knows, maybe once you get used to it, you won't want to go back to some of the GUI interfaces ;) ).\n", "Q: Apt-get update errors (can't read the package lists) After running the an update from the update-manager I tried to install chromium:\nsudo apt-get install chromium-browser\n\nAnd I got the following error (full output from `sudo apt-get update' on Ubuntu Pastebin):\nReading package lists...

Any help would be GREATLY appreciated! Here is the story :)\nLooking for speed I decided to install Ubuntu 10.04 LTS about two months ago. It was working great for a month. Absolutely no problems. It was fast while using and it booted up and shut down incredibly fast too. After realizing some PPAs just dont support 10.04 anymore and wont ever again, I decided to upgrade to 12.04 LTS. Everything went smooth. Upgrade was fine. Then I noticed boot problems a few days later. Lots of error messages. Sometimes the hard drive would \"decide\" on its own to go into read only mode while I was using the computer throughout the day. I couldnt save files any longer, I couldnt save open tabs in browsers, I couldnt copy files, I could not open programs, etc. In short, the computer or the hard drive went \"read only\" on me. I noticed more problems on boot. For example, sometimes It would just never boot up. It might go to a grub> prompt or not even get that far.\nOne of the errors I always see on boot is this... an ata4 error message...\nata4.00: error: { ICRC ABRT }\nThis became crippling for me. I could no longer get things done if I could get the computer to boot up at all.\nOriginally wanting Ubuntu 10.04 for its speed and stability, I played around with a few other OSes like Xubuntu, Lubuntu & Mint, but settled on the new Elementary OS Luna still in beta. Install went great. Used it for a couple days, then the dreaded read only hard drive problem started up again. Now I can barely boot up into my system. (Im using it now and trying to type fast in case it goes into read only mode!). Here is a reoccurring error grouping that happens on just about every boot. Essentially I see if the computer can get passed the errors it will boot, if it cant it goes to grub or locks up.\nhttp://paste.ubuntu.com/5576745/\nIn short:\n\n\n*\n\n*10.04 worked flawlessly\n\n*12.04 had all sorts of problems\n\n*Elementary OS Luna (newest beta) same problems\n\n\nNot sure where to go from here on this. Ive read so many forums and pages and comments about this type of error message. From changing the hard drive cable, to changing the hard drive, to running all sorts of terminal commands.\nAny ideas would be so helpful. Thank you so much!\nPS... if I cant figure this out, Im considering re-installing Ubuntu 10.04 and see if it runs stable again. That would be very interesting indeed.\nPPS... Disk Utility shows SMART Status of my hard drive as HEALTHY\n\nA: First of all,I have to tell you that 12.10 is NOT worse than 10.04, but the update thing is the problem. Second I had some sort of same problem, although I could solve it for myself, but it worked that terrible that I had to re install it at last. In your case I don't think there is any problem with your hard disk, but I'm afraid I have to tell you that the best way is to reinstall 12.10.\n", "Q: Removing the filesystem quota on a partition I want to install Dovecot on Ubuntu 12.04 LTS, and it recommends that we place the control files into a partition which will not be limited by the filesystem quota.\nIf I create an ext4 partition with 2 gigs, how do I remove the quota on that partition? I know the partitions are defined in /etc/fstab, and I think usrquota and grpquota have to be explicitly set to disabled. \nBut I am unsure what the entire line should look like.\nIs it something like:\n/dev/hda2       /       ext4    defaults,usrquota,grpquota        1       0        0\n\nOn the other hand, I found something called quotaon and quotaoff. Would this be used instead of fstab? Is there a difference? \n\nA: Your mount points are defined in /etc/fstab and those options will be used by default every time you boot.\nSo if you use the line:\n /dev/hda2       /       ext4    defaults,usrquota,grpquota        1       0        0\n\nquotas will be enabled when you boot.\nThe commands quotaon and quotaoff will enable / disable quotas from the command line.\nSee: http://manpages.ubuntu.com/manpages/dapper/man8/quotaon.8.html for additional options.\nSo if you wish to disable quotas by default, use noquota in fstab\n/dev/hda2       /       ext4    defaults,noquota        1       0        0\n\n\nA: Quotas are off by default, and must be explicitly enabled by building quota files with quotacheck, and placing the quota flags in /etc/fstab for quotaon -a to recognize and activate the quotas during boot.\nSo unless you did all that, you don't have to do a thing.\nIf you did, then you can turn them off with quotaoff and removing the flags from /etc/fstab to prevent them from being turned back on at the next boot.\n", "Q: Why is the command line needed to erase CDs and DVDs Ubuntu 12.10 Newbie questions.

It links to the dialer-app on Launchpad.

So this time I am trying out Xubuntu. \nI tried to watch a 1080p video on YouTube. While I was watching, CPU usage was mostly like 90-70%, rarely 30%. Is this too much?

All of them were assisted by hardware video acceleration (mplayer-vaapi  on AMD/HD4000) and is played perfectly althoug I noticed differences in processor core temperature which made me curious. I used the same player and movie for each install and monitored with htop. \nApproximate CPU load according to htop:\nLubuntu: 20 - 30 %\nXubuntu: 40 - 60 %\nUbuntu:  70 - 95 % (Ubuntu 2d without compositing) \nSo it seems to me that your hardware (probably without hardware video decoding) is doing quite well. Lubuntu could speed it up a bit more, and since you only have 4GB flash I second Greyscaleimag3s' advice. Go for Lubuntu.\n\nA: 4 GB flash disk could get a little small, only some distibutions run that small, try Lubuntu instead, this would maybe also fix the CPU problem, as Lubuntu is very lightweight.\nIf Xubuntu should stay, try to  deinstall/disable running, not frequently used background services\n", "Q: Unable to find or create trash directory? I am a user of Xubuntu and I have a problem with it.

I hope I find a solution for this problem, as I can't get rid of useless files. Thanks.\n\nA: For me this happened after I added the LXQT window manager; I'm unaware if that is related, but I am using a fresh install and that is all I have done so far, so that is why I mentioned it. To fix it, I simply had to change the permissions for the Trash directory:\nsudo chown -R $USER ~/.local/share/Trash\n\n\nA: This happens if you delete the trash directory. If you are the only user in the system, it is a hidden directory named \".Trash-1000\" in each partition (HDD or removable device).\nThis must contain three directories:\n1. \"expunged\"\n2. \"files\"\n3. \"info\"\nI would suggest copying the directory from another partition and deleting the files in it.\nI had the same problem and it was solved this way. Your case may be different.\n\nA: I have a similar problem after installing LXQT/lubuntu and switching back to Ubuntu.\nA simple solution is to go to ~/.local/share folder and delete the \"Trash\" folder.\nsudo rm -R ~/.local/share/Trash\n\nThen try to delete a file, it will create the default Trash folder with all the required permissions.\n\nA: No need to have it somewhere else to copy it:\nFirst, confirm that your normal user is ID \"1000\":\n$ id\nThen\n$ sudo mkdir -p /.Trash-1000/{expunged,files,info}\n$ sudo chown -R $USER /.Trash-1000\n\n\nA: If you have touched your /etc/fstab then you have to fix it. Your lines there must be something like /dev/sdc1 /media/Data ntfs-3g defaults,uid=1000,locale=en_US.utf8 0 2.\nNote about uid=1000\n\nA: I solved this by unmounting my NTFS drive and again mounting\n\nA: I solved this issue by remounting by NTFS drive with proper permissions using the flag:\nmount -o \"uhelper=udisks2,nodev,nosuid,uid=1000,gid=1000,dmask=0077,fmask=0177\" <drive name> <mount point>\n\nThis assumes your used id is 1000 which you can check with the id command.\n\nA: When automounting using gnome-drives, in the mounting options I wrote:\nnosuid,nodev,nofail,x-gvfs-show,uid=1001,gid=1001\n\nIn a terminal write id, and whatever is the output should be where I have put 1001 - in your case it might be 1001 or 1000\n\nA: This happens when the file to delete is on a different partition than the trash folder. The trash folder is usually $HOME/.local/share/Trash. The source of the problem is that you can't rename files across partitions.\nIf this is the root cause, go into the folder which contains the file you want to delete and then:\ndf -h .\n\nThe last column is \"Mounted on\" which gives you the path on which the partition is mounted. In my case, this is /data\nTo fix the problem:\ncd /data       # <<--- the the value from the df command above\nsudo mkdir -p .Trash-$UID/{expunged,files,info}\nsudo chown -R $USER .Trash-$UID\nsudo chmod -R 0700 .Trash-$UID\n\nThis will create a trash can on the partition which is owned by the current user ($USER and $UID).\nSee also:\n\n*\n\n*https://askubuntu.com/a/1100519/22431\n", "Q: How to make a Boot Disk (700 mb CD)?

Is there any current nvidia package (like nvidia-current) on xorg-edgers ppa for Ubuntu quantal?\nI cant see any, i just found nvidia-310 and nvida-313\nMaybe another ppa?\n\nA: The \"-current\" suffix refers to the compatibility of these drivers: it is for recent generations Nvidia cards. The nvidia-310 and nvidia-313 packages are targetted at the same generation nvidia cards, you can safely use them as replacement for nvidia-current. In fact, these packages provide the package nvidia-current in the next Ubuntu version (Raring).\nIf you really want to stick to the nvidia-current naming, you can try adding the ubuntu-x-swat/x-updates PPA, that still provides packages named nvidia-current.\n", "Q: How to increase the disk space of Ubuntu installed besides dual boot without using WUBI?

Wanted to open a file (.pdb file: protein structure format, never mind) by a double-click.\nThe \"open with\" is manually directed to execute \"pymol\" (a program that open the .pdb format) with Ubuntu Tweak.\nHowever, I found that the working directory is $HOME.\nAs other files on the directory I opened the file is crucial I want to access them.\nI guess that the \"pymol\" is executed on $HOME while the absolute path of the \"pdb file\" (double-clicked file) is passed as an argument.\nI guess this is somewhat general problem and ask a question:\nHow can I let the system change the \"working directory\" to the \"directory where I clicked the file\" and execute an program?\n\nA: None of the above solution worked on my debian. Also %d is deprecated. See Desktop Entry Specification. \nSo I'm using the following bash script to run pymol.\nFirst you need to create the following bash script file and save it in /usr/local/bin/run_pymol.sh. I saved the file in /usr/local because it seems the xdg-open does not understand what is the HOME directory or so on.\n#!/usr/bin/env bash\n# change working directory\ncd `dirname $1`\n# run pymol\n/usr/bin/env pymol $@\n\nSecond, give the executable permission to that file. Open a terminal and type the following commands to give a permission and to confirm.\n% chmod +x /usr/local/bin/run_pymol.sh\n% run_pymol.sh\n\nFinally, modify your pymol.desktop file as the following and then your pymol will start\nin the directory where the first given file is located.\n#!/usr/bin/env xdg-open\n[Desktop Entry]\nVersion=1.0\nName=PyMOL Molecular Graphics System\nGenericName=Molecular Modeller\nComment=Model molecular structures and produce high-quality images of them\nType=Application\nExec=/usr/local/bin/run_pymol.sh %U\nTryExec=pymol\nIcon=pymol\nMimeType=chemical/x-pdb\nCategories=Education;Science;Chemistry;\n\nHope it helps you guys :-)\n\nA: I don't understand why solution up there so upvoted, it do absolute different thing. It changes working directory to those where .desktop file is, while question was about to change working directory to those with opened file(s).\nMy solution:  \nExec=/bin/bash -c 'cd $(dirname $0) && micro $0'\n\nBear in mind that setting env variables for .desktop files is different, like so\nExec=env CPATH=../include /bin/bash -c 'cd $(dirname $0) && micro $0'\n\n\nA: Although this is years later, here's what worked for me:\nExec=bash -c 'cd \"%k\" && ~/path/to/your/file'\n\n%k gives you the path of the directory of the launcher you just launched.\n\nA: You can go to /usr/share/applications and find the proper file.desktop that is called whenever you open a specific file type. Then edit it and in the exec line add cd PATH && to the start of the line.\n\nA: OK - \nExec=cd PATH &&  <application-name> %F\n\ndid not work for me as PATH is not defined to point to the path of %F.   The only variables available in any applications desktop file are:\n\n\n*\n\n*%f   a single filename. \n\n*%F   multiple filenames. \n\n*%u   a single URL. \n\n*%U   multiple URLs. \n\n*%d   a single directory. Used in conjunction with %f to locate a file. \n\n*%D   multiple directories. Used in conjunction with %F to locate files. \n\n*%n   a single filename without a path. \n\n*%N   multiple filenames without paths. \n\n*%k   a URI or local filename of the location of the desktop file. \n\n*%v   the name of the Device entry.\n\n\nThere it is: %d is the single directory you're looking for, as it doesn't make sense to change to multiple directories.  So go to /usr/share/applications and edit the file application-name.desktop (in your case pymol.desktop); you have to have superuser privileges to do that.  Then locate the line that starts with \"Exec=\".  It probably reads\nExec=<application-name> %F\n\n(In your case Exec=pymol %F).  Change this line to\nExec=cd %d && <application-name> %F\n\nSave that desktop file, and next time you click on a .pdb file your working directory should be the one this .pdb file is in, so pymol can see all of your files there.\nOf course, you could also start pymol from the command line after having first navigated to the directory where your files are, but I guess you wanted a GUI solution, so you have to do a little editing :-)\n\nA: Similar but not identical approach to @tuxForLife:\npassing current dir as first parameter:\n#!/usr/bin/env xdg-open\n[Desktop Entry]\nVersion=1.0\nType=Application\nTerminal=true\nExec=/usr/bin/bash /home/frank/bin/checkExtensionless.sh \"%k\"\nName=checkExtensionless\nIcon=system-upgrade\n\ncheckExtensionless.sh\nI encountered that the pathcomes in single quotes if the filename has spaces '/somewhere/my stuff/' so I had to remove those, then cd into it.

I am in a university which has authenticated proxy. Wine is not detecting this. Hence, none of the applications inside wine is getting internet connection. Please help. \n\nA: I'm struggling with this as well, funnily enough. This is what I've worked out so far:\nWine will grab proxy settings from the environment variable \"http_proxy\". If you're planning on using the same proxy settings throughout the entire session, you can change the http_proxy variable. Follow these instructions: https://askubuntu.com/a/151047/142903\nIf, like me, you use the computer on more than one network, one of which has a proxy and one of which doesn't, things get a little trickier. Do all processes inherit environment variables from ~/.bashrc?\nNB: You may find it useful to use Gnome or KDE, both of which have graphical interfaces for modifying proxy settings.\nEdit #2: After a LOT of digging, I finally found this article on BRAMP.NET describing how to use iptables to redirect all outgoing web traffic on port 80 through a proxy server. The writer mentions that if directly sending the packets to the server doesn't work, it is possible to set up a local proxy server using something like Squid that will point to the network proxy.\nThis should work for applications that don't respect the http_environment variables. I'm currently working out whether this will still work in 12.04/12.10/13.04, and how to have it done automatically using a script inside /etc/network/if-up.d.\nEdit #3: Even more digging has led me to this wonderful post describing how to redirect all system traffic through a SOCKS5 proxy set up by Redsocks - this may be adaptable to suit the current problem.\n\nA: Neither setting http_proxy (and HTTP_PROXY) nor using the regedit trick made it work for me. However, using a socksifier helps. Simply install tsocks (or tsocks:i386 in case you have a 32bit wine in use for the program you want to use), configure /etc/tsocks.conf for your proxy server, and export LD_PRELOAD=/usr/lib/libtsocks.so before running wine (e.g. in your .bashrc).\n\nA: You can check Internet Settings by running:\nwine rundll32.exe shell32.dll,Control_RunDLL inetcpl.cpl\n\nor Wine Internet Explorer by:\nwine iexplore\n\nbut I don't think you can change the proxy there, unless you'll try to install the standalone web browser which would support that (e.g. MS IExplorer, Firefox or Opera).\nHowever the workaround is to set-up proxy directly in registry:\nwine regedit\n\nand change the key in HKEY_CURRENT_USER\\Software\\Microsoft\\Windows\\CurrentVersion\\Internet Settings by setting ProxyEnable to 1 and specifying ProxyServer address.\nOr run the following command:\ncat << EOF > proxy.reg\nRegedit4\n[HKEY_CURRENT_USER\\Software\\Microsoft\\Windows\\CurrentVersion\\Internet Settings]\n\"MigrateProxy\"=dword:00000001\n\"ProxyEnable\"=dword:00000001\n\"ProxyHttp1.1\"=dword:00000000\n\"ProxyServer\"=\"http://ProxyServername:80\"\n\"ProxyOverride\"=\"<local>\"\nEOF\nwine regedit proxy.reg\n\nto set-up automatically (change ProxyServername with appropriate hostname).\nSource: How do I configure proxy for IE that runs on Wine? at Quora\n\nA: As Wine is emulating a Windows environment to let you run Windows application on Linux, this is over the mechanism used by these applications to go to the Internet that you have to look.\nOr there is a dedicated set of setting in the application itself to enter the proxy parameters (IP, port, username and password).\nOr the application retrieve the proxy settings from the installed and configured Microsoft Internet Explorer. Windows components like Internet Explorer can be installed easily using the winetricks application.\n", "Q: Source package: precise build dependencies policy for Software Centre I was seeking for a detailed specification of what's allowed as build dependencies for sources packages to be published in the Software Centre.\nI found Ubuntu Policy Manual — Chapter 4 - Source packages (don't know if this link is still valid by the way), it's rather precise while lacking some sort of precisions.\n\n\n*\n\n*What if a build requires a version of a compiler which is not available by default for a target platform. As an example, say a source package requires GCC 4.8 to build while Ubuntu Precise only provides GCC 4.6?\n\n*What if a build requires a compiler which is not freely available? As an example, current version of the Ada compiler in Ubuntu Precise does not properly support the last version of the standard, or some applications which would requires some commercial Prolog compiler to compile.\n\n*What if a build depends on a library source package which is not made available as a separate source package? The above link says there should be no source duplication, but if the library's sources are not available separately, then there is no other way to do except copying the library source in the application's source package (providing it's legally OK to do this way, which is always the case if the author of the library and application, is the same).\n\n\nThese are the three questions I have pending in my mind and the above link does not answers, and I prefer to have explicit answers instead of raw personal guesses.\nHave a nice day all.\n\nA: Replying to myself, my apologies.\nAbout the second question, may be a possible answer could be to use a compiler targeting ISO/ANSI C, as some high level language compilers do. To re‑use the example case, let say an application requires this or that commercial or non‑free Prolog compiler to compile, then if that Prolog compiler is able to target C (and not just native machine code), then perhaps that's OK to have a source package based on the C source the higher level compiler produced. This kind of machine‑generated source is most of time less well presented than hand‑written source, but does it really matter after all…\nIf these assumptions are right, then this would means if one wish to publish something to the Software‑Centre, then he/she have to use a tool chain which is able to generate C source as the target.\n", "Q: chromium + web proxy I am trying to set up a web proxy for chromium on my 12.10 lubuntu box. In firefox I simply add the address of the autoconfigure script http://ipaddress/autoconfig in the \"Automatic proxy configuration\" box in preferences->network->settings and it works perfectly.\nIn chromium I have tried various possible solutions, all of which have failed so far.  What is the right way to do this?\nThe solution given below works but uses the same proxy for all web pages and requires you to use a command line argument when you run chromium.  \n\nIs there a way to do the equivalent of what firefox does? That is load\n  the autoconfigure script (a javascript file) telling chromium which\n  URLs should use the proxy (see e.g.\n  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proxy_auto-config )?\n\nThat is I would like chromium to only use the proxy for selected pages. I would also like to  be able easily to turn the proxy on and off. \n\nA: In theory it should work when you set a system proxy. \nYou can try running from the command line\nchromium  --proxy-server=host:port\n\nchange \"host:port\" to your proxy server.\nIf that works you can update the launcher or create a custom menu entry.\nYou may need to file a bug report.\nAnd for the keyboard shortcut route, you could edit ~/.config/openbox/lubuntu-rc.xml (after ensuring you have a back-up).

It's supposed to be written back via sync and during umount. Seeing that you don't mention that the SD card is hanging at all suggests the damage is severe enough to create false positive write back responses or in simpler terms your disk is lying to you when it says a write is complete.\nYou could try toggling the write protect switch while the card is removed from the system. e.g.\n\n\n*\n\n*toggle write protect\n\n*insert\n\n*do something trivial\n\n*unmount/eject\n\n*reverse write protect\n\n*rinse/repeat\n\n\nIn an effort to tickle the circuitry which might be caching a \"stuck at 1\" value.

My question is:\nIs it safe to delete System Reserved (BOOTMGR in it), as I use GRUB2?\nI mean:\nDoes the GRUB2 loads win7 itself, \nor does it load the BOOTMGR which then loads win7?\n\nA: The user who asked the question Dual Boot Issue, Windows 7 64 bit Ubuntu 12.10 64 bit confirmed (further down in the comments section) that Grub2 can load Win7 even after the System Reserved partition is deleted.\nBut perhaps you can first make a backup of the partition, format it and make sure it works for you as well before deleting the partition.\n\nA: It did work, but this is how: \n1)Deleted the System Reserved. Windows 7 stopped booting at all. \n2)Ran Win7 CD - Recovery -> Startup Recovery (or something) multiple times (I had to do it 3 times). \n3)In GRUB I marked the Win7 partition as 'boot'. \nFrom here I tried again the Win7 recovery in combination with adding manualy an entry to GRUB Customizer, until GRUB somehow evetually was able to find by itself the win7.\n", "Q: Should I have Wireless if I'm testing Ubuntu on my laptop via usb? I am no tech wiz, that's why I'm here.   \nI have successfully(or so I think) installed Ubuntu onto a USB and have booted my laptop with the disk.

If not then ill probably install next to my current server.    \nAny thoughts would be great, \nD\n\nA: Short answer is yes, you are supposed to be able to connect to either a wireless or wired network with a the LiveUSB/LiveCD (trial Ubuntu).\nIn the case of a wireless adapter, you're gonna need the correct driver installed for it. In my case, the Additional Drivers window popped up several minutes after the system booted into the LiveUSB/LiveCD, and I was able to install the wireless adapter driver without downloading anything.\nTry starting the Additional Drivers window by clicking on the power icon on the top right corner, clicking on \"System Settings\", and followed by \"Additional Drivers\"\nEdit:\nI assumed you promptly tested the hardware switch for WiFi before posting here. If you didn't, it's a good idea to try it. (Credit goes to @pfeiffep)\n", "Q: Ubuntu and Windows 8 Boot problems (SSD uefi) I hope someone can help me because I just dont know what else to do! I have a Dell XPS 15z that has 1TB HDD and 128GB SSD. It came with Windows 8 installed on the SSD. First thing I did was install ubuntu 12.10 on the SSD but the installer couldnt find Windows 8 so for like a month my computer would just boot into Ubuntu. I had no problems since, at the moment, I am not using Windows (but i would want to have it someday).\nSo everything was ok until today that I run a software update on Ubuntu and after the restart my computer just went into Windows 8 and I now cant go back into Ubuntu.\nAny suggestions? Thanks\nEDIT:\nI was just able to enter Ubuntu by pressing F12 at turn on and going into boot options. I could see both, Windows 8 and Ubuntu(and Ubuntu's swap I think). MAy be from ubuntu I could fix this easier? \nThen i went and downloaded the boot repair app:\nboot repair check http://paste.ubuntu.com/5577728/\nAnd then I trusted the boot repair app  and after the supposed \"fix\" it gave me this report  http://paste.ubuntu.com/5577739/ and after the restart I get this:\nafter the restart I get messages like\n\n\nfailed to open /efi/Microsoft/boot/grubx64\nfailed to load grub\nfailed to open /efi/boot/grubx64.efi\nfailed to load grub\nchecking media [media]\nchecking media\n\nAnd then after a few seconds it goes into a grub menu in which only\nthe Ubuntu option works. The others fail.\n\nTHANKS! hope someone can help me!\n\nA: GRUB was loading on your computer; it just wasn't presenting a menu because it believed there were no options available. As I understand it, you're now back to something that's virtually identical to your original state -- you can boot Linux but not Windows. The only difference is that now you've got a GRUB boot menu. If I've misunderstood, please clarify.\nUnfortunately, booting Windows is not GRUB's strong point. There are numerous suggested GRUB configurations available online, but they often fail -- what works on one system fails on another. The one I've got offhand is this:\nmenuentry \"Windows 8\" {\n    insmod part_gpt\n    insmod chain\n    set root='(hd0,gpt1)'\n    chainloader /EFI/Microsoft/Boot/bootmgfw.efi\n}\n\nYou'd need to enter this into /etc/grub.d/40_custom and then run sudo update-grub to make it available. Note that you may need to change the set root= line and/or the chainloader line for your boot loader. Because you've run Boot Repair, the chainloader line needs to reference the Windows boot loader's new filename (probably bkpbootmgfw.efi).\nAnother option is to install my rEFInd boot manager, which tends to be more reliable at launching Windows. Unfortunately, the fact that you've run Boot Repair complicates this, because Boot Repair moves and renames the Windows boot loader and copies GRUB into the old Windows boot loader location. Thus, you may need to change this back, either manually or by re-running Boot Repair and selecting options to undo its changes.\nWith either solution, you may need to either disable Secure Boot in your firmware or install an updated version of shim. The former is likely to be much easier, but I can't say precisely how to do it because it varies from one EFI to another. The latter option is trickier and is complex. See the rEFInd shim documentation for details on how to do it with rEFInd.\n", "Q: How can I boot Ubuntu from a USB?

I use a vary secure email service that has a really small quota (under 100 megs), I'd like to have my main ubuntu 12.10 32 bit system to download the mail, delete it off the server, notify my mobile devices. Sure I could set up all my devices to the mail server but if my home system downloads it then deletes I may not get notified of said mail. Anyone have a solution?\nThanks in advance.\n\nA: You will need a mail service for your mobile devices to connect to. \nI would: \nsetup a second mail account (gmail or something) and forward the mail (on your pc) from the first mail service to the second. then configure your mobile devices to connect to the second mail service. \nHowever, this kinda beats the purpose of using a very secure mail service. \nYou could solve this by more configuration, do not forward the mail but simply send a notification mail to the second mailbox that a mail has arrived in the first. you wont be able to read the mails on your mobile device but you will get notified that there is a mail. \nAnother solution would be to configure your local system to leave the mails on the server for 24 hours after download. and configure your mobile devices to check the secure mail service. \n", "Q: Can I delete windows after Ubuntu using wubi? I installed Ubuntu 12.10 using Wubi, and it works great.\nI need storage space, and would like to stop using Windows 8, so can I delete Windows and keep using Ubuntu?\nSince I installed Ubuntu using the \"Windows Ubuntu Installer\", they must be related to each other, I guess.\n\nA: Windows actually looks at your Ubuntu OS as a \"software\" installed on it, so deleting Windows will effectively delete your Ubuntu also.\n\nA: To keep Ubuntu on the computer and get rid of Windows will require wiping Windows and reinstalling Ubuntu.  But there might be another solution: if you can shrink the Windows partition (which will include the Ubuntu installed in WUBI), and thus get enough room to do a fresh install of Ubuntu (not WUBI), you'll then be able to access all of your Windows data (and Ubuntu WUBI data).  At that point you'll be able to grab the data you need and want and move it to your new Ubuntu installation (or even run a backup from Ubuntu WUBI, saving the backup in your new Ubuntu installation), then delete the Windows partition and expand the new Ubuntu installation to take over that space, and then restore your backup.\nI know that might sound complicated, but it's really pretty easy.  Just one step at a time.\n\nA: You are correct in assuming they are related.\nWubi installs Ubuntu as a program, just like MS Word, iTunes, etc. (to name a few). So if you were to delete Windows 8, you would also end up deleting Ubuntu.\nSince you want to move to a full installation, there are two paths you can take from here:\n\n\n*\n\n*Install Ubuntu fresh, overwriting everything else.\n\n*Convert your current wubi installation into a full setup.\n\n", "Q: Black screen when installing ATI Drivers on Netbook I just installed Lubuntu on my Aspire One 725.

Even to do that you might need application like WINE and as J Moore pointed, you can see some serious issue's running Adobe Creative Suite 6 on Linux using WINE.\nWhat I can suggest is, you have two options:\n\n\n*\n\n*You can try installing a Virtual Machine for Windows and try installing Adobe Creative Suite 6 there to work on, that should not be an issue.\n\n*If you are not just specific to Adobe Creative Suite 6 and can install any alternative cross-platform audio editor then I would suggest you to try Audacity.\nHope this helps.\n\nA: You don't; it appears to be broken in Wine: http://appdb.winehq.org/objectManager.php?sClass=version&iId=25911\n", "Q: Why do I need the ssh server package to rlogin into my machine? When I try to login into a Ubuntu machine using rlogin it mentions ssh connection refused. In order to resolve this I installed the openssh-server package on the remote machine.\nWhy is this not part of the Ubuntu distribution? Do I really need this service?\n\nA: SSH is a server-client technology.  You need an SSH server on your remote machine if you want to connect to it remotely via SSH protocol. There is no way around it. Just like you need an FTP server in order for you to connect to that same machine via FTP.  I believe if you installed the server edition of Ubuntu, it should have the SSH server package installed by default. Otherwise, you'll need to install it, and configure it properly/securely.\n", "Q: How do you install ubuntu on a pre-installed windows7 system How do you install ubuntu on a pre-installed windows7 system which usually comes with the max of 4 primary partitions already used up by the windows 7 installation. As these systems do not come with a windows system disk you cannot simply re-install windows if you mess up. So getting it right first time is critically important. I have seen some great instructions on www.avoiderrors.net but none deal with this specific but very common situation encountered by new users.\n\nA: You can try Wubi, it is an officially supported installer for Windows users that allows Ubuntu to be installed and uninstalled in a safe, easy way as with any other Windows application. \nOnce you are done download Run Wubi, insert a password for the new account, adjust other settings such as the disk space, and click \"install\".\nThe installation process from this point on is fully automatic.\nThe installation files (approximately 700MB) will be downloaded and checked, after which you will be asked to reboot.\nDo so and select Ubuntu at the boot screen. The installation will continue for another 10 to 15 minutes and the machine will reboot again.\nThat's it. Now you can select Ubuntu at the boot screen and start using it.\nYou can always refer to the Installation Instructions here\n\n", "Q: Deleted the Ubuntu file in Windows, but i am still prompted to choose between Ubuntu and Windows on boot I installed Ubuntu using Wubi. I got version 12.10 32-bit. After all was done I noticed a file on my C: drive labeled Ubuntu so i figured when i wanted to uninstall this would be the file to delete. But I have deleted this file and I still get the Menu when i start up my PC that asks me to pick an OS. SO how can i remove Ubuntu from this and just have my PC boot directly into windows? \n\nA: There their is a small program called EasyBCD for.\nhttp://neosmart.net/EasyBCD/\njust go to edit boot menu and remove ubuntu and your done.\n\nA: If you installed using WUBI, you can just use the \"remove or edit a program\" tool in windows to delete Ubuntu since it is installed as an application.\n", "Q: Can I install ubuntu to a partition on my portable hard drive? Ok I've got a live USB which I can load the ubuntu 12.10 installer from so that's no problem. I am very cautious about losing files and I don't have much space on my computer anyway so I am going to install ubuntu to my 300 gig portable hard drive.\nHere's the deal:\nMy computer has 2 internal drives:\nC: 500 gigabytes\nD: 1000 gigabytes\nAnd then my 300 gig portable hard drive has 2 partitions:\nM: My Stuff - 211 gigabytes NTFS\nP: Ubuntu (currently blank) - 86 gigabytes NTFS (I tried formatting it as ext4 but windows couldn't detect it anymore so I changed it back. I know it needs to be ext4 for ubuntu to boot though)\nNow I want to boot my computer from the USB and install ubuntu to the portable hard drive on the 86 gigabyte partition without touching my main 2 hard drives or the 200 gig partition on my portable have drive. Is it possible to install ubuntu 12.10 to this Ubuntu partition and get it to boot correctly? If so please tell me step by step how to achieve this installation without corrupting my computers boot loader.\nThanks in advance ;)\n\nA: Yes, it is possible to do so. First of all install Ubuntu simply on your 300Gig partition. Notice that this will change all boot loaders. So then you have to fix boot loader as you like. To do so:\n\n\n*\n\n*If you do not have any other ext partitions on your 500Gig or 1000Gig hard disks then you have to fix your MBR using some tools in hirenCD. Download HirenCD, burn it to a blank disk, remove 300Gig hard disk from your system, reboot your system with HirenCD and find Fix MBR. \nevery time that you want to boot to ubuntu you must change your first boot device from bios.\n\n*If you have some other ext partitions on your 500Gig or 1000Gig hard disks then try to install grub on one of them. This can be done with a live ubuntu using sudo grub-install --boot-directory=/media/extPartitionThatYouHaveMounted sda. (sda is important for you, in your case it might be sdb or sdc).\nIt is not needed to change first boot device from bios each time.\n\n*I think that it is possible to install grub on some ntfs partitions. There we have grub for dos, it is the same grub, but for windows based partitions. This would be like option 2.\n\nA: You can boot from your liveUSB or liveDVD, then connect your portable usb hard disk. It should most probably be located at /dev/sdb to be sure open a terminal and type sudo fdisk -l and take note of the 86Gb partition that you want to use for Ubuntu.\nLaunch the installation and make sure to install on /dev/sdbx where sdbx stands for your partition (example sdb2). When it arrives at the grub bootloader installation, select /dev/sdb (without the partition number).\nThis way when you boot from the external drive it will use the bootloader on the eternal drive. You do not need to have Grub installed on your internal hard drives.\nI do have an external hard drive with Linux and an NTFS partition similar to what you wish and it works fine.\n", "Q: Where can I find a driver for the AMD ATI HD 7290 video card on my Aspire One725?

The fact that this entry appears at all may be a bug in the GRUB configuration scripts. Instead, use the >>Windows 8<< entry. In theory, it should work -- although GRUB is finicky, so it might not, and your attempt to fix things from the Windows repair disk might have made matters worse.\nIf you can't seem to get GRUB working, you could try installing my rEFInd boot manager. Installing the Debian package from Ubuntu is the easiest way to do this. If this is successful, you'll see a rEFInd screen with an option to boot Windows and probably several options to boot Linux. If the Windows option and at least one Linux option work, you can trim the Linux options later by editing /boot/efi/EFI/refind/refind.conf.

Recoll creates a full-text index of your PDF files (and many other file types), which you can then search through as if you were using Google. It's capable of searching through individual files and showing all search results in a neat overview.\nYou can get the newest release from the developer's official PPA by typing:\nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:recoll-backports/recoll-1.15-on && apt-get update && apt-get install recoll\n\nUnfortunately there's still no tutorial on how to use Recoll here on Askubuntu (something I hope to do in the future), but the official documentation is very detailed.\nAfter you've set up Recoll you can search through a specific document by setting the search mode to query language and wording your search like this:\nfilename:document.pdf searchterm\n\nYou can access the result overview of a specific document by clicking on Snippets. If you have evince installed (the standard PDF viewer Ubuntu ships with), clicking on the page number will direct you to the corresponding page and pass the search term to evince's inbuilt search. You can then highlight the search term by hitting CTRL + F in evince.\nRecoll's advantage over the inbuilt search in PDF viewers like evince or acroread is that it operates with a pregenerated Index. This makes searching for a term almost instant, even when working with thousands of documents.\n", "Q: Install drivers for Dell Inspiron 7420 I just installed ubuntu on my laptop Dell Inspiron 14R 7420.\nHow do I install the softwares which are required the shortcut functions, such as turning on light the keyboard fn + f6 or disable the mouse pad fn + f3)?\nThank you very much for your help!\n\nA: I don't know how to fix that, but you should look this (https://www.linuxwind.org/html/tag/dell-inspiron-7420), may be it can help you.\n", "Q: Logitech Trackman Marble cannot middle-click I have a Logitech Trackman Marble (also known as a MarbleMouse), which lacks a middle button.

I'm having problems with 12.10 and 13.04 regarding Steam (specifically Team Fortress 2 game) which at some random point I will experience a fps drop, something like from 200 to 10. I'm not sure but this could be a memory leak because the whole system gets slow afterwards, only a reboot to fix (sometimes a lightdm restart).\nI even created a thread on Steam Linux Discussions reporting how to fix it on 12.04.1 by manually upgrading the kernel to 3.5.0-25 (Link HERE), but somehow if the kernel comes with the system (like on 12.04.2/12.10/13.04) the problem still persists.\nI love 13.04 and 12.10, but I can't see any major differences in performance or anything else, just in their repositories (12.04 has \"older\" versions of the majority of programs out there). So, what makes 12.10/13.04 better than 12.04?\n\nA: Most changes between different Ubuntu release versions are not very interesting to an average user. The newer version would usually include the latest software version available at the time of its development. \nThese include the kernel, various tool chains and many of the desktop applications. The newer versions of the software have lots of benefits, including\n\n\n*\n\n*newer features\n\n*better performance and \n\n*various bug fixes.\n\n\nWhile these might be non-obvious to users who are not overly interested in the development of Ubuntu, they are very much helpful in making the newer version better in every way possible.\n\nIf you are interested in all the technical and non-technical changes in 12.04 and 12.10, you can take a look at the release notes of both the versions:\n\n\n*\n\n*Release Notes - 12.04\n\n*Release Notes - 12.10\nThe release notes lists all the major improvements of crucial components that is good to know for the end user.\n", "Q: Compiling php 5.2 from source under 12.04, apxs2 (via libtools) ignores the -prefix used with ./configure In the source directory:\n./configure --prefix=/home/ashkan/Development/php/bin/php-5.2  --with-mysql --with-apxs2=/usr/bin/apxs2\n\nmake works fine but make install says:\nInstalling PHP SAPI module:       apache2handler\n/usr/share/apache2/build/instdso.sh SH_LIBTOOL='/usr/share/apr-1.0/build/libtool' libphp5.la /usr/lib/apache2/modules\n/usr/share/apr-1.0/build/libtool --mode=install cp libphp5.la /usr/lib/apache2/modules/\nlibtool: install: cp .libs/libphp5.so /usr/lib/apache2/modules/libphp5.so\ncp: cannot create regular file `/usr/lib/apache2/modules/libphp5.so': Permission denied\napxs:Error: Command failed with rc=65536\n\nUPDATE: reading man apxs2 it seems apxs compiles and then installs the module into apache module directory.

Authentication with ssh is not enough to decrypt your home folder (the .ssh is encrypted with your home folder). You must authenticate at console to decrypt the folder first.

We're not voice experts, but some of you might\n  be, let's make the distributable free software solution the best\n  solution.\n\nSource : http://gould.cx/ted/blog/Introducing_HUD_2.0\nCMU Sphinx is an open-source project that can also be used on the Desktop, Julius too.\nOn the long term Ubuntu Touch and Ubuntu for Desktop will be the same OS, so the answer to question like \"can it be used on Desktop too ?\" should hopefully be more and more positive.\n", "Q: how to install Ubuntu server In dual Boot PC with Ubuntu and XP? I have a Dell Dimension 4600 desktop that I no longer use and I decided to turn it into a server. It is running Windows XP. Now, I had a flash drive that has Ubuntu 11.0 on it where I used it to install Ubuntu on another computer. Anyway, I downloaded Ubuntu Server onto the flash drive and used the flash drive to install Ubuntu on the desktop----When I realized that it was not Ubuntu Server but Ubuntu 11.0 I could not stop the install in fear of doing damage. So, now I have Windows XP and Ubuntu 12.04(I did the upgrade) on this desktop. I want to install Ubuntu Server. How do I go about doing that?I am new to computers and Ubuntu . so please give me detailed explanation.\n\nA: Since you don't need your desktop Ubuntu, you can install your server on the partition you used to install the desktop version. Its easy to recognize which partitions are currently occupied by the desktop version. The ones which show an \"ext\" partition while allocating partitions are the ones belonging to Ubuntu(desktop). So, first delete these partitions(\"partitions\"(plural) because you may have allocated different ones for / /home swap, /boot etc.). So delete all of them, by pressing on the - button on partition screen and then re-allocate the partitions according to your convenience.\nIf you feel that the process to install/partition a server version of Ubuntu is different from the one for installing a desktop, then no, its not. You need not worry, only thing you keep in mind is delete \"ext\" partitions and reallocate them. This way, you won't have to handle grub-rescue too!\n", "Q: Software update fails  Failed to fetch cdrom://Ubuntu 12.10 _Quantal Quetzal_ - Release amd64 (20121017.5)/dists/quantal/main/binary-amd64/Packages  Please use apt-cdrom to make this CD-ROM recognized by APT. apt-get update cannot be used to add new CD-ROMs\n\nW: Failed to fetch cdrom://Ubuntu 12.10 _Quantal Quetzal_ - Release amd64 (20121017.5)/dists/quantal/restricted/binary-amd64/Packages  Please use apt-cdrom to make this CD-ROM recognized by APT. apt-get update cannot be used to add new CD-ROMs\n\nW: Failed to fetch cdrom://Ubuntu 12.10 _Quantal Quetzal_ - Release amd64 (20121017.5)/dists/quantal/main/binary-i386/Packages  Please use apt-cdrom to make this CD-ROM recognized by APT. apt-get update cannot be used to add new CD-ROMs\n\nW: Failed to fetch cdrom://Ubuntu 12.10 _Quantal Quetzal_ - Release amd64 (20121017.5)/dists/quantal/restricted/binary-i386/Packages  Please use apt-cdrom to make this CD-ROM recognized by APT. apt-get update cannot be used to add new CD-ROMs\n\nE: Some index files failed to download.

I already had a second partition for my data, so there was no need for that.\nNow after a succesfull installation (not really sure about, hence my question), I get the grub bootloader on startup and I have an option to also boot windows.\nIs this the preferred setup? I read a lot that grub should be installed on a different partition and that windows should take care of booting. Is this true? Will windows updates break my installation?\nAfter some searching I found that I could use easybcd as seen on http://neosmart.net/wiki/display/EBCD/Ubuntu to use the windows boot loader. Won't it overwrite the GRUB  in MBR?\nThank you in advance\n\nA: GRUB should be in the Master Boot Record (MBR) of the first hard drive. This is usually /sda (not to a partition within the drive, such as /sda1 etc.).\nThe above works for pre-UEFI / Windows 8 systems. For details of installing on UEFI/Windows 8 system see: Installing Ubuntu Alongside a Pre-Installed Windows with UEFI. \nI have used this default GRUB setup for many years and never had any problem with it. In particular, Windows Updates did not mess up GRUB. However, if you need to reinstall Windows, then you will have to reinstall GRUB after installing Windows. This is easy to do. The Ubuntu installation stays unharmed by Windows installation process, unless you format the whole drive by mistake.\nIf you upgrade Windows, say from Vista to 7 or 7 to 8 that will erase GRUB as well. You can just install GRUB form a Live USB/DVD. \nI have never used Windows installer instead of GRUB. Leaving GRUB out of the picture is not a good idea as it allows booting different kernels from the same Ubuntu installation. This is very useful if a kernel update in Ubuntu breaks something. Then you can boot to the previous kernel using GRUB and uninstall the kernel update.\nHope this helps.\n\nA: Hi gl3nn this is how I've installed my Ubuntu. But I'm very sure that windows updates will never break your installation. And its OK to let grub handle the boot process. \nYou want /home on different partition than windows because windows uses some encryption method while shutting down, which won't let you to boot from Ubuntu. But be careful while you \"UPGRADE\"( not updating windows) or \"REINSTALL\" windows. Reinstalling or upgrading will remove grub(only grub) completely and windows starts with windows boot manager which you can fix in 15 min. I think you can access recover options by pressing f8 button while booting to windows. Feel free to ask if I've missed anything. Totally what you've done will not let you to any problem until you upgrade or reinstall windows.\n\nA: To go completely safe you can install GRUB on a USB stick (you have that option in the installation menu, drop-down list at the bottom). I have such set-up and have been using it for a long time now. It serves me quite well as it leaves Windows to it's own devices. \nI, for example, clone Windows system partitions with Clonezilla to have a snap-shot of the system and \"reinstall Windows\" as needed in 5 minutes. GRUB stays untouched on my USB then, no need to reinstall it. Works like a charm!\nI'm using Windows Vista though.\nEdit: HOW-TO install GRUB to USB stick\nYou can install GRUB to USB stick by going with \"Something else\" option in the installation process, that means a bit more advanced work. You should try it out though.  \nPlease proceed with care and do not do any changes to your disk if you are unsure what you are doing. Ask more questions if needed, but do take a look at this approach.  \nFirst, you need to allocate space for your Ubuntu. That means creating free space on your hard drive. Either achieve that through your system's disk management or boot Ubuntu from LiveCD and start GParted. Then do:\nInsert your USB stick.\n\n\n*\n\n*shrink one of your partitions\n\n\n*\n\n*things to consider: how many partitions have you got (you can have maximum 4 Primary partitions) that is why you'll be creating Extended Partition\n\n*what are their sizes and how much space do you consider enough for Ubuntu (in most cases for system alone and some space 10GB is more than enough)  \n\n\n*create Extended Partition from that (select and create a new partition in the unallocated space and allocate 100%)\n\n*In that extended partition you will make Logical Disks:\n\n\n*\n\n*system partition - bare minimum (a root main system folder, the /, best go with ext4 format) and\n\n*a swap partition (format to linux-swap)\n\n*you might consider making a separate /home partition - this way your personal files and settings will be safe in case you need to re-install Ubuntu. I recommend it.\n\n\n\nIf you are only making system partition and swap, allocate as much space for swap as you have memory and as much space for system partition as you can spare.\nIf you go with separate /home partition, 10GB should be enough for system partition, as much as memory for swap and the rest for your files like music, videos, pictures and settings and more.\nDone? Good, close GParted.\nOnce your partitions are ready, click on Install Ubuntu (it will probably ask you to unmount device /dev/sdb1 or some such) answer yes.\nWhen at the method prompt - choose Something else option. You will notice at the bottom of the window Device for boot loader installation. We will come back to that.\nFor each partition you have created in previous step - select it and click Change. The options I spoke earlier about: /, /home they are called Mount Points and this is what you must choose for each. For swap, click it and use as swap area.\nInstalling GRUB - from the drop-down menu choose your device (if only one usb device is present, it will be /dev/sdb).  \nMake sure you have chosen /dev/sdb and not /dev/sdb(n), where n is a number. It must be /dev/sdb or whatever letter your USB stick was assigned.\nReview your choices, make sure everything is OK. Double-make sure. Click install now.

This point may be significant because Ubuntu needs to have a browser present at all times: see Why does removing Firefox install another browser? and Can I uninstall & replace Firefox with another browser of my choice?.\nIn view of the requirement for a www-browser, OP maybe better off first checking out the software installed on the system using dpkg --get-selections. If there's an acceptable alternative to Firefox present, purging the Aurora PPA shouldn't pose a problem. The purge step can then be followed by a simple sudo apt-get install firefox.\nHowever, if Aurora is the only browser present, I'm not sure that purging the PPA first will be successful. OP would need to study the output from apt-get at this point.\nApologies for posting this as an answer in case it's deemed to be irrelevant.\n", "Q: trying to have a group be able to read/write to a directory First I'm a NEWBIE - I'm using a Bitnami stack to deploy a Rails app.\nBitnami has the rails applications in /opt/bitnami/projects.\nI created a group called deployers.

So close now\n\nA: It may be a bug of Ubuntu, see:\nhttps://serverfault.com/questions/415174/debian-6-preseeding-keeps-asking-write-the-changes-to-disks-and-configure-lvm\nThe one required for Ubuntu that appears to be forgotten sometimes is:\nd-i partman-lvm/confirm_nooverwrite boolean true \n\n", "Q: Necessary to increase size? I used the Windows installer to install Ubuntu 12.10 64 bit. The PC also has Vista Ultimate 32 bit.\nIn any case, I recall that one of the question asked was where and how much space to provide for Ubuntu installation, which I think I allocated 10 GB on a pretty large partition.   \nIs there a way to allocate more than 10 GB now that Ubuntu is installed?  If so, how?  Thanks.\n\nA: You can use gparted software to resize another partition and add resized partition to your Ubuntu partition. Goto software center and type gparted. Most of the case the first result will be the GParted software(Free software) itself install and enjoy.\nUpdated: Both facts mentioned by Uri Herrera are true. But I've made some assumptions here. Continue if your system has partitions like this.\n1. You have at-least 3 partitions, one for Windows, second for Ubuntu, another for your stuff.\nIf this is so, you can resize partitions other than Ubuntu and Windows partition using gparted but you cannot add to Ubuntu since it was mounted.\nSo you can do from windows itself. \nBrowse and download Easeus partition manager. You can do both resizing and adding to Ubuntu partition. At-least you can expand up-to 30 GB.\n", "Q: harddisc clone vs fresh install In terms of stability and performance, is it better to clone the entire HDD to a new computer or start with a fresh install?\nbtw, much of my production software is in a virtual machine, which can be easily moved.But still, my ubuntu baremetal install (non virtual) is highly customized and tweaked.\n\nA: IMHO, fresh install, a copy of the entire HDD (raw copy, dd style), or a copy of the whole file system (tar / rsync style) doesn't make much of a difference, neither in terms of stability nor performance.\nWhen you talk about copies, though, you need to be careful about a few things:\n\n\n*\n\n*/boot/initrd* files. With each kernel you generally end up creating an initrd, an image containing basic drivers that the kernel itself needs before it is able to boot your system. If the hardware where you copy your system to is different, initrd is different, and may not be able to boot.\n\n*xorg.conf configuration and similar. Again, if the hardware is different, it is unlikely that the old configuration will work. Much of X config, however, is automatically detected in recent days.\n\n*if you copy the whole HDD raw using dd to a new machine, the new machine needs to have a disk of similar size. Unless you are the kind of person that enjoys playing with parted :) Also, make sure the disk you are copying is not mounted (or mounted read only) and sane (fsck clean) before copying it. You don't want to copy a corrupted disk or a disk in the middle of a write.\n\n*if you copy the whole HDD using tar / rsync, make sure not to copy /proc and /sys, prefer using options like -a and --numeric-ids, and make sure again you don't copy files in an inconsistent state. Example: you really don't want mysql to be writing to a database file while you are copying it.\nThat said, I've done both fresh installs and copies.\n\nA: harddisk clone = OS clone/image ?\nClone /Backup / Image\n\n\n*\n\n*Well it depends on you what you need but if your current system is running fast without bugs and erros you can clone/image by using acronics or clonezilla and there are many more to clone entire os with whatever you have installed on your system and if the current OS is not to much stuffed than it will be cloned fast and restored fast i suggest you using acronics becasue its fast and stable.\n\n\nAdvantages of Clone\nOnce you have cloned the HD or OS than everytime your system has a big error instead of installing a new copy you can just restore everything in ONE click may be it takes normally 10-20 mins if the clone is not to much heavy.\nFresh Install\n\n\n*\n\n*On the other side fresh install is like out of the box new copy you have to reinstall all the things/ programs ETC.\n\n\nMy suggestion\nIf your OS has alot of your stuff and tweaks and you want to keep them than and your system runs well than do a clone becasue if you have any kind of error than first try to remove the error and than clone cz you dont want to clone the error with your OS clone.\nAnd if you dont care about your tweaks/customizations/data than do a Fresh install [Always recomended when you do a fresh install do a clone of fresh install when the system is working great]\n", "Q: Nvidia drivers on Ubuntu 12.10 I followed instructions to install nvidia drivers found here: Nvidia driver doesn't work in 12.10\nBut it doesn't work for me. Same problem like in the question above: no dash and windows don't have borders.\nI tried opening nvidia-xsetting, which asked me to run nvidia-xconfig. Running that did nothing but generate a broken xorg.conf which I had to remove because of really low resolution. I thought this is \"unity not loading problem\" but instead this seems to be \"driver not loading problem\" because nvidia-xsetting said that I don't use nvidia drivers (which btw I find really weird because lsmod says nvidia kernel module is indeed loaded), and games didn't load either.\nI can \"fix\" this by doing modprobe nouveau, but with nouveau 3D games like 0 A.D. are broken.\nAny ideas? I'm out of them.\n\nA: I solved it. Problem was that nvidia cards for notebooks (I got geforce 635M) require bumblebee:\nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:ubuntu-x-swat/x-updates\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get upgrade\nsudo apt-get install linux-headers-generic bumblebee bumblebee-nvidia\nsudo reboot\n\nAfter reboot run your games ( 0ad for example ) like this:\noptirun 0ad\n\nWorks like charm.\n", "Q: How do I install Ubuntu on to a blank laptop I downloaded Ubuntu to one laptop and burned it to a blank dvd. Then I put the CD to the blank laptop on start up and nothing happens. There was no Windows image disc burner software on the laptop. What do I do? Thanks.\n\nA: Check your BIOS settings and make sure it's booting from the CD-ROM. You can check your BIOS settings by pressing F2, F10, or F12 it should show which button to press to getting into your BIOS settings on the screen on boot up.\n\nA: Two things are important to clarify here. \n1. Have you burned the CD with \"boot CD\" options ?\n2. Have you changed the boot priority of your system to CD-ROM in BIOS settings ?\nAnd since you are asking question about installation mention the version of the system (laptop) and the motherboard that your system configured with.\nBut here is your answer if you have burned your CD with Boot option.\nGenerally to get into BIOS settings f2 or del will be the key. If both of them doesn't work for you, check on-line to know your bios key. Then set boot priority to CD-Rom, save and exit. Now insert your CD and reboot your system it will start from Ubuntu.\nNote : Since you have not yet installed the os, take this advice. Create a partition of about twice or equal to your RAM size and assign it for swapping purpose(You will see this option while installing). It is required for hibernation purpose which you are going to use definitely.\nUpdate : Burning CD with Bootable option using Nero: Follow instructions in this link \"path=Blog%3A%2F%2FDisplayBlogComposite%2FNero%2F7419946&NCSS=a105m2ZYu9KFk6jZd0ce28lWPpMvvNt5fffd#0\">http://my.nero.com/index.php?_path=Blog%3A%2F%2FDisplayBlogComposite%2FNero%2F7419946&NCSS=a105m2ZYu9KFk6jZd0ce28lWPpMvvNt5fffd#0\"\n\n\n*\n\n*To go to bios settings turn on and press immediately esc button and then(one second later) f2 button for setup f12 button for boot setup. i.e esc and f2 or esc and f12. Look for option boot and set boot priority as mentioned before.\n\n", "Q: How can I get rid of the message \"kvm: disabled by BIOS\"? I'm getting a message:\nkvm:disabled by bios\n\nafter upgrading my kernel to 3.8.x. I've never installed the KVM package. Neither I can enable virtualization from my BIOS, because of a BIOS bug. I just want to get rid of this weird message. Tried removing any kernel module using modprobe but it didn't work.\n\nA: First of all, you might want to see if KVM is loaded in the kernel. To do this, run something like this:\nlsmod | grep kvm\n\nIf you do get any answer from that, you may want to stop kvm from running. To do that, this will help:\nmodprobe -r kvm\n\nRemember to follow for any other kvm module. In my case, there is also a kvm_intel module, so I also have to run\nmodprobe -r kvm_intel\n\nTo stop kvm from being enabled at boot time you have to find the file located at /etc/modules and modify it so that KVM doesn't launch at boot time. After you modify your /etc/modules file restart your computer and see if the problem persists.\n\nA: What worked for me: \n1) Turn on the computer and press f2 to see the setup (BIOS) when you see a screen with black background. \n2) Go to \"Configuration\" tab. \n3) Select the option \"Intel Virtual Technology\" and enable it by pressing F5 or F6.\n4) Press F10 to save and exit. When a prompt message appears asking you to confirm this action, select yes. \n5) Your computer will turn off for 10 seconds. Then, it will boot and load your OS without showing that error.\n\nA: Create a file called /etc/modprobe.d/blacklist-kvm.conf:\n(For example, you can use gedit gksu gedit /etc/modprobe.d/blacklist-kvm.conf or nano sudo nano /etc/modprobe.d/blacklist-kvm.conf)\nPut in it the following three lines:\nblacklist kvm\nblacklist kvm_intel\nblacklist kvm_amd\n\nI'm not sure if this will work for you, because I don't have a suitable system also disabled by BIOS. But this is a reasonable way of disabling KVM on Debian or Ubuntu, so you should try and see if it also works to disable your message.\n\nA: You can either remove kvm\nsudo apt-get purge qemu-kvm\n\nor ignore that message, it is not hurting anything.\nPerhaps there is a bios update available ?\n", "Q: Can't resize partition during installation I want to dual boot windows 7/ubuntu. I have installed gparted, but I can't make a partion because I can't click on the option to resize. How do I work around this?\nAlso. Tried putting windows 7 disc in, says cannot resize and can only install by deleting ubuntu off it.\n\nA: In order to resize your partition you'll need to unmount the disk. Though it's likely that your trying to edit the same partition of the drive you booted from. In order to resize that drive you'll need to boot from an Ubuntu live disk and edit the partition from that.\n\nA: Ok here is the Readers Digest version of what you need to do. Place your Ubuntu Live CD into your DVD drive and boot from it. Once loaded you can now use Gparted to repartition you HD. When using Gparted think ahead as to how much Hd space you are going to devote to it as Windows OS and programs are a bit bloated. Now resize your Linux partion space to make room for Win7. Ok once that is done now go to your future Win7 partition space and make it (primary Partition) Windows doesn't like to share. You can format this as NTFS or not at this point as the Windows install disk will see it and ask you to format it before it starts the installation. Now the last thing you may need to do is edit your Grub bootloader. I have usually done this the other way around using the live CD with Windows as the main Operating system and the Live CD took care of the bootloader for me but would show both Operating systems. BTW here is a web site that someone else went to great lenghts to outline for others (http://www.dedoimedo.com/computers/dual-boot-windows-7-ubuntu.html) just copy and paste hope this helps.\n\nA: Windows 7 only seems to install if there is nothing else on the hard disk. If it sees grub, it has a hissy fit and refuses to install.\nI have created partitions, I have played with cables, and no matter what you do Windows 7 just doesn't install. Older versions of Windows 7 seemed to work, but MS is actively doing everything in its power to prevent dual boot. Not sure if this is intentional, or by accident.\nSo, safest option is to back stuff up and start with Windows 7 install. Then when that's done install Ubuntu.\nI'm sure in the time you have spent on trying to fix this you could have already done it the hard way.\nGood luck either way, its a pain for sure, I even contemplated installing Windows XP.\nI chose to install VMWare, even runs Open GL to a degree.\n\nA: I would like to suggest you to use Gparted Live CD. It will allow you to resize, copy, and move partitions without data loss.\nThis tutorial will provide you step by step guide. You can also visit gparted live manual.\n", "Q: 1 suspicious file with size 140TB?

Is it fully possible to install Ubuntu on a slave HDD, by using Wubi,  I've Windows 7 as primary HDD ?\nI mean will Wubi installation go normal on \"slave HDD\", like no blue screens of death , or any mishappenings n accidents like data loss etc..\nI've HDD structure of 2 X 1TB of 2 HDDs.\nDisk0\nC: Windows 7 - 40GB\nD: Store (for data n all) - 891 GB\n\nDisk1\nE: HDD1 - (for backups mostly) - 931GB\n\nNow what I want is to make a 30GB partition from E: (Disk 1 \"slave\") and install Ubuntu there using Wubi.\nSo Will WUBI be able to install Ubuntu on \"slave HDD\" normally, without any fatal mishappenings or accidents or ny kind data loss.\n\nA: The Wubi aim is to enable existing Windows users, unacquainted with Linux, to try Ubuntu without risking any data loss (due to disk formatting or partitioning mistakes). It can also safely uninstall Ubuntu from within Windows.\nWubi (Windows-based Ubuntu Installer) is an official Windows-based free software installer for Ubuntu, which installs the software on an existing Windows partition, thus without need for partitioning.\nWubi adds an entry to the Windows boot menu which allows the user to run Linux. Ubuntu is installed within a file in the Windows file system (c:\\ubuntu\\disks\\root.disk), as opposed to being installed within its own partition. This file is seen by Linux as a real hard disk. Wubi also creates a swap file in the Windows file system (c:\\ubuntu\\disks\\swap.disk), in addition to the memory of the host machine. This file is seen by Ubuntu as additional RAM.\nLimitation of Wubi:\nCompared with a regular installation, a Wubi installation faces some limitations. Hibernation is not supported and the filesystem is more vulnerable to hard reboots.[1] Also, if the Windows drive is unmounted uncleanly (Windows crash, power failure, etc.), Ubuntu will not be able to mount the Windows drive and boot until Windows has successfully booted and shut down. If the Windows system cannot be booted after the crash, the user also cannot boot Ubuntu.\nPerformance related to hard-disk access is also slightly slower, more so if the disk image file is fragmented, on a Wubi install compared to a normal one.\nSince Wubi installs root.disk on top of the Windows file system which could technically become corrupted and even prevent Windows from booting, running chkdsk /r (may take a significant amount of time to run) to fix the damaged file system and shutting down Windows cleanly may help.\n\nA: As stated Wubi has some of it's own limitations, like some stated above.\nSo can Ubuntu be installed on a \"slave HDD\" , \"Without Wubi installer, with normal installer\" .

I choose the first one:\nDownload files from current release (2:9.000-0ubuntu3)\nfglrx-installer_9.000.orig.tar.gz (106.7 MiB)\nfglrx-installer_9.000-0ubuntu3.debian.tar.gz (42.2 KiB)\nfglrx-installer_9.000-0ubuntu3.dsc (1.5 KiB)\n\nI assume the first one was the correct one. \nNow how do I install it? \nThe guide says to use the Hardware drivers Manager, but I can not find it. \nSo basically, I'm asking if I have the correct files?  Secondly where is the Hardware drivers manager, and once I find that how do I install the driver for the card? \nUnless someone has another way of doing it that is easier? \n\nA: Unzip the file (right click then uncompress or unarchive) and then double click on the .deb file which will open the softwares manager.\n", "Q: How to fix dependencies / broken packages When I try to install system updates, skype or phpmyadmin I got this error:\nYou might want to run 'apt-get -f install' to correct these:\nThe following packages have unmet dependencies:\n libc6 : Depends: libgcc1 but it is not going to be installed\n         Depends: tzdata but it is not going to be installed\n libc6-dev : Depends: libc-dev-bin (= 2.15-0ubuntu10.3)\n             Depends: linux-libc-dev but it is not going to be installed\n             Recommends: gcc but it is not going to be installed or\n                         c-compiler\n skype:i386 : Depends: libasound2:i386 (>= 1.0.16) but it is not going to be installed\n              Depends: libc6:i386 (>= 2.3.6-6~) but it is not going to be installed\n              Depends: libc6:i386 (>= 2.7) but it is not going to be installed\n              Depends: libgcc1:i386 (>= 1:4.1.1) but it is not going to be installed\n              Depends: libqt4-dbus:i386 (>= 4:4.5.3) but it is not going to be installed\n              Depends: libqt4-network:i386 (>= 4:4.8.0) but it is not going to be installed\n              Depends: libqt4-xml:i386 (>= 4:4.5.3) but it is not going to be installed\n              Depends: libqtcore4:i386 (>= 4:4.7.0~beta1) but it is not going to be installed\n              Depends: libqtgui4:i386 (>= 4:4.8.0) but it is not going to be installed\n              Depends: libqtwebkit4:i386 (>= 2.1.0~2011week13) but it is not going to be installed\n              Depends: libstdc++6:i386 (>= 4.6) but it is not going to be installed\n              Depends: libx11-6:i386 but it is not going to be installed\n              Depends: libxext6:i386 but it is not going to be installed\n              Depends: libxss1:i386 but it is not going to be installed\n              Depends: libxv1:i386 but it is not going to be installed\n              Depends: libssl1.0.0:i386 but it is not going to be installed\nE: Unmet dependencies. Try 'apt-get -f install' with no packages (or specify a solution).\n\nHow to solve this?\n\nA: -f or --fix-broken\n\nExplanation from the man apt-get pages\n\n\nFix; attempt to correct a system with broken dependencies in place. This\n           option, when used with install/remove, can omit any packages to permit APT\n           to deduce a likely solution. If packages are specified, these have to\n           completely correct the problem. The option is sometimes necessary when\n           running APT for the first time; APT itself does not allow broken package\n           dependencies to exist on a system. It is possible that a system's dependency\n           structure can be so corrupt as to require manual intervention (which usually\n           means using dselect(1) or dpkg --remove to eliminate some of the offending\n           packages). Use of this option together with -m may produce an error in some\n           situations. Configuration Item: APT::Get::Fix-Broken.\n\n\nI recommend trying the following commands.\nsudo dpkg --configure -a\n\nsudo apt-get install -f\n\nAnswer yes to any prompts and let apt-get try to resolve the issue for you.\nEDIT:\nBased on comment try the following command it should clean up your system.\nsudo sh -c \"apt-get update;apt-get dist-upgrade;apt-get autoremove;apt-get autoclean\"\n\n", "Q: Share internet (with same IP address) I am currently housing in a place that allows only a limited number of devices connected to the internet. Problem: I have more devices than allowed. So I have one Ubuntu machine which is connected via Ethernet and now I would like to share it's connection, but without that the connected device generates an new IP (via DHCP) and thus wouldnt count up against the limit. Available interfaces: WiFi and Bluetooth. I want the devices connected to my Ububtu machine to go out to the internet AS the Ubuntu machine. \nWhat technologies / protocols /  permit this? Forgive me if it is a stupid question, but I dont understand well all the different networking technologies. Thanks a lot already for any hint!!\n\nA: Your simplest option is to use a switch/router with NAT capability to present one IP address to the outside world, while allowing you to use as many machines as you like.\nSuch devices are very low cost.\nUseful entry level Wikipedia article on NAT here\n\nA: Go to settings -> network. Select wireless. And press the button \"use as hotspot\". Write down the connection key and let your devices connect. \nMore info about sharing your connection:\nInternet/connectionSharing\n", "Q: Where would I find Google IME for Marathi language? I need to type in Marathi on Ubuntu. Where would I find Google IME for Marathi language.\n\nA: I believe there is no Google IME in Ubuntu for Marathi. But if you want you can add a full fledged devnagiri keyboard. It takes a while to remember the new keyboard but once you have learnt it you no longer need Google IME. Below is the procedure to add Marathi keyboard.\nGo to settings/keyboard layout/ then press the '+' icon on the bottom and search for 'Indian' keyboard layout. You can now switch between Marathi and English using the keyboard icon on the top.\n\nA: All settings -> Text Entry -> (+)add Marathi (KaGaPa phonetic). Done.\nSwitch to next source using: Super(Windows) + Space\nSwitch to previous source using: Shift + $uper + Space\n", "Q: Phonon Test of speakers \"Front Left\" , \"Front Right\" is not working I am using KDE 4.10, Kubuntu 13.04. My audio is working great. But when I configure Phonon and try to test the speakers, I don't get any sound.\nWhen I start the configuration tool with:\nkcmshell4 kcm_phonon\n\nand press the \"Front Left\" or \"Front Right\" button, I get this error message:\nALSA lib pcm.c:2217:(snd_pcm_open_noupdate) Unknown PCM 0\n\nMaybe the tool simply fails to load the wav test file? Where are they supposed to be located?\n\nA: I had, and fixed, the same problem with my installation. I guess you are using pulseaudio. The solution is to install the libcanberra-pulse package and the tests should work like a charm.\n", "Q: How does Ubuntu One work? Excuse me for my very stupid question. I just wanna know this:\nIf I \"upload\" something on Ubuntu One and then I delete it from my computer, that file still is in Ubuntu One or just go away it too?\nBecause in Ubuntu One you synchronize a folder (or more). So does every modify in that folder affect what there is on Ubuntu One, or not? I'd like to have a service that allows me to put, for example, my first year university material on the web and delete it from my pc. Do you know how can I do that?\n\nA: Ubuntu One is a synchronization service. It synchronizes every change you make to your file - delete, rename, edit, move etc.\nSo, if you delete the file from your PC after it gets uploaded to Ubuntu One, your file would be deleted from the Ubuntu One account as well.\nWhat you actually need is to use a Backup/File Storage service. Some of the popular options before you are:\n\n\n*\n\n*Déjà Dup along with Ubuntu One - Can I use my Ubuntu One account to backup with Déjà Dup?\n\n*SpiderOak\n\n*CrashPlan\n\n*Wuala\n\nA: I use all of these for different reasons.  I do like Ubuntu One the best because of the amount of online storage as well as because it can auto synchronize with my Droid.  The second best in my opinion is Google Drive, it is easy fast and works well.  Looking at Wuala looks like it has some pretty interesting sync features as well (but you are not looking for sync of course)\nBox (25 gigs of online storage if you use the following link)\n(http://www.tuaw.com/2013/02/08/box-offering-25gb-for-free-in-promotion/)\nGoogle drive as stated above\n(5 gigs)\nMicrosofts SkyDrive\n(7 gigs)\nDrop box\n(2 gigs) (synchronization)\n", "Q: all packages keep unmeting dependencies all the time All problems begin when I was trying to install graphics card driver.

Aptitude is not going to clean this up in and of itself -- though following its suggestions for fixing broken dependencies will get you back to a working situation. What's more important is that aptitude will likely give you the insight to fix this situation, because of the way it helps track dependencies.\n", "Q: how to install wireless driver broadcom STA (wl) for asus x201e with kernel 3.8.1 I need to install any working driver for wireless for this laptop, however, after re-installing bcmwl-kernel-source which was installed with OS, I get this:\nmodprobe wl\nFATAL: Error inserting wl (/lib/modules/3.5.0-25-generic/updates/dkms/wl.ko): Invalid argument\n\nthis driver previously worked but I was trying to get some alternative, because this driver is proprietary and didn't work with kernel 3.8.1 which I wanted to install (I am using btrfs filesystem and this new kernel fixes some issues with that).\nSo I rebooted back to official kernel 3.5.0 but I am unable to get this driver to work again.

Processes are an important\npart of any OS. Each process has its own, unique ID, which is a number.\nYou can send signals to a process to kill it. This is explained below.\nManaging processes, beginner's manual\nFirst open a Terminal (press Ctrl+Alt+T).\nA terminal allows you to run commands on your computer,\nand see what they output.\nOnce the terminal is open, type:\npidof firefox\n\nPress ENTER to issue the command, and if you had Firefox open,\nit will output something like that:\n14497\n\nWhich means “a process named ‘firefox’ is running and his ID is 14497”.\nNow, to kill that process:\nkill <PID>\n\nReplace PID with the process ID (in this case 14497) of the process\nyou want to kill. Press ENTER and Firefox will close.\nNow, if you run pidof firefox again, it shouldn't output anything,\nbecause there's no longer a Firefox process running.\n\nAll at once\nSince running pidof and then killing is tedious, you can simply run:\nkillall firefox pidgin\n\nAnd it'll kill all the processes that are named firefox or pidgin.\nIf no processes are found, it'll tell you:\nfirefox: no process found\npidgin: no process found\n\n\nA: ps -e on your terminal\nand identifiy those processes.\ntype \nkill <number>\n\nnumber is the number infront of the process that you want to kill.\nBut if you don't know what are those processes. It's better to not to kill them. \n\nA: you can use top and htop.\ntop is installed with Ubuntu.\nyou can find the process you want and you can kill it if you want but you must be root user.\nsudo kill <PID>\n\nhtop can give more better look with top but you need to installed it with \nsudo apt-get install htop\n\n", "Q: Moving bytes from one files to another I have an empty file (only zeroes are in it) of size 9,0KB and I need to write another file (with size 1,1KB) to it, but the first file must not lose it's.

I have tried to use dd, but I haven't succeed - file resizes.\ndd if=out/one.img of=out/go.img\n\nDoes anybody know how can I do it?\n\nA: You should use:\ndd if=out/one.img of=out/go.img conv=notrunc\nSee also man dd.\n", "Q: Folders showing lock icon Whenever I open my documents, all the folders in it are displayed with a lock icon. Therefore, I cannot delete any file or folder in it.\nI tried changing the root access using sudo chmod user:directory/  but it fails. I am not able to delete or perform any file action with it.\nWhat action should I perform to fix it?\n\nA: Run the following to fix your home directory permissions:\nsudo chown -R $USER: $HOME\n\n\nA: sudo chmod 777 -R /path to folder you want to delete- This would give all permissions (Read, Write, Execute) to you\nThe permissions (in this case 777) are as follow:\n\n\n*\n\n*7 - Full (Read, Write & Execute)\n\n*6 - read and write\n\n*5 - read and execute\n\n*4 - read only\n\n*3 - write and execute\n\n*2 - write only\n\n*1 - execute only\n\n*0 - none\n\n\nFirst number change Ownership of file, second affect Group of users can access, and third refers to Others user.\nOwner   Group   Other\n  7       7       7\n\nafter changing the permission, try and delete the folder.\n\nA: Open terminal and type \ngksudo nautilus\nBrowse to the location of documents. Goto properties and set the permission for owner as well as group as read and write. Now try to delete the folder from another nautilus window (one without root privileges).\nDon't forget to close that super user nautilus as soon as you don't need it any more!\n\nA: This would happen probably because you downloaded something from the web. And you don't have the write access to the folders. If you are sure that the files are virus free, try the following command.\nchmod -R +rw *\n\nThis will remove the lock icon from the nautilus.\n\nA: I had this problem as I had set everything to chmod 755 to get back into my system after messing with /var permissions.\nsudo chown -R $USER:$USER ~\n\nsolved it for me, eventually. I had to delete some files I'd downloaded first.\n\nA: Change the file permissions of lock file via CHMOD command:\nuser@pc:~$ sudo chmod 754 /var/lib/lock *\n\nNote: 754 is access permission and path to the directory of lock file present  if 754 doesn't, do try 777. Once done you can delete the file.\n\nA: You should have a look at this answer on Super User. Adding on to this answer, you can also create a bash function like this:\n# bash function for changing locked status of folders, pass folder name as command line argument\nunlock() {\n    chflags -R nouchg $1\n}\n\nYou can put this function in your .bashrc (Linux) or .bash_profile (Mac) file and run source ~/.bashrc or source ~/.bash_profile to rebuild the bash file.\n", "Q: How to run PHP code in browser directly from Geany? I'm using a latest Geany version from official repositories, same with a php5 package.\nThere is my question:\n\n\n*\n\n*How to run PHP code from Geany directly in web browser instead of terminal?\n\n\nI know, there are some options about what program needs to be runned (terminal, browser, and grep), but I have no idea where it is used.\n\nA: php doesn't run in the browser, it runs on the server. You need to install a web server with php support. The Ubuntu Server Guide documents this in detail. You can easily get started by installing the libapache2-mod-php5 package\n$ sudo apt-get install libapache2-mod-php5\n\nAnd then you can put a php file where the apache server can read and execute it. e.g. /var/www\n$ echo '<?php phpinfo(); ?>' > /var/www/test.php\n\nNow visit http:// localhost /test.php and you should see the php info page.  (I had to break this url to make askubuntu happy - links cannont contain localhost.)\nSee also: https://help.ubuntu.com/12.04/serverguide/php5.html\n\nA: After a year...\nFastest solution to run PHP code instantly is a custom build option:\nphp -S localhost:8080 -t \"%p\" -e & sensible-browser localhost:8080/\"%f\"\nIt will run a php process with internal server with root in the project directory, and run default browser on same port and file which build command was executed.\n\nA: Geany is great. We can write a scrip, e.g. python, then run it. And it will run just like a normal IDE like Netbean do. It even will show the result in GUI when we run python with wxPython. Of cource, Python and wxPython must be installed first.\nIt also able to show output of PHP and/or HTML scrips directely in a Browser, so far as I know, Firefox. Of cource, a Geany project should be set first to do that. Again, web browser, PHP anda MySql must be ready first.\nTo directly output a PHP scrip in a Browser, e.g. Firefox. Do as follows :\nOpen a Geany project, then : Project -> Propesties -> Build. There are 3 group option to edit : PHP Command, Independent Command and Execute Command. Thera are 2 columns in Execute Command group.\nLook at the bottom of the window (Click here)\nFill the second column with :\n  firefox \"http://localhost/your_project_folder/%f\"\n\nAnd the third column, fill with your document root of your project e.g :\n  /var/www/html/your_project_folder\n\nThas all.\n\nA: if you use a webserver always running as a local service (as I do), you can use GeanyLua to convert absolute path to localhost URL path and then open it in a browser, thanks to string patterns (~regexes):\nlocal f = geany.filename()\n--[[\ntry to split path in 3 parts: DocRoot parent path, DocRoot, relative path + filename\nelse open the file with file:// scheme directly\neasy to adapt: '/var/www/'…\n--]]\nlocal s,e,path,p,file = string.find(f,'^(.*)(/Public_html/)(.*)')\n\nif p == '/Public_html/' then\n  target = (\"http://127.0.0.1/\" .. file)\n  firefox = ('firefox ' .. target ..

But my system partition is  90% used.\nIn the disk usage analyzer,indicates that my file system has only used 23.5GB.\nBut disk usage analyzer  also indicates below the tool bar: used 82.5GB & available 8.3GB.\nHow can I gain the lost disk  space?\n\nA: When I used Photorec as root to recover files it also created directories as the root in my home directory.Too delete those directories root privileges are essential, I really didn't hit Shift+Del to delete them only moved to trash as root.\nI found all of my undeleted recovered files in /root/.local/share/Trash/files. I deleted them with Shift+Del & recovered 51.3GB of space. This thread \" deleted photorec backup files taking up disk space\" in Ubuntu forums helped me to find the solution.\n\nA: You might have a slight filesystem damage since the crash (which occurred halfway during a write action and therefore not quite without consequences).\nIt is quite possible that i.e. the files are removed but the harddisk space not yet marked as free.\nschedule a filesystem-scan at next reboot, and reboot\n(to schedule such check, open a terminal and type: sudo touch /forcefsck )\nafter the fsck (=filesystemcheck) you can use disk analyser again.\nIt is completely possible that fsck repaired some deleted files...there is a big chance then that they ended up in the /lost&found directory. They can be deleted without any problem. \n", "Q: How can I upload media with MiniDLNA media server or are there any DLNA servers that allow this?

Since a password is required to be a superuser (to install and modify programs), what are the risks to not use a firewall under Ubuntu ? More particularly if I am using a NAT router ?\n\nA: Using a NAT, if you have no port forwarding to your machine, it is not accessible from the internet unless you explicitly open a connection to it (with vnc or teamviewer for example) so I think there is no problem not using a firewall on it. The unique worry could come from internal (LAN) access but usually not the case on home lan.\n\nA: It depends. Most people use a router between their desktop and the internet and by default there are no sigificant open ports, so in the vast majority of user cases a firewall adds very litte, if anything.\nIt can help if you inadvertantly install a server, such as VNC or SSH.\nA better question is what do you want to use a firewall for ?\nSee:\nhttps://wiki.ubuntu.com/SecurityTeam/FAQ#UFW\nhttps://wiki.ubuntu.com/SecurityTeam/Policies#No_Open_Ports\nhttps://help.ubuntu.com/community/UFW\nIf you want a graphical tool for your firewall, use gufw\n\n\nA: It sounds like the question is about a host-based firewall on an Ubuntu PC. \nIF the machine never leaves the NAT-based network (ie, it is not a laptop that you take to coffee shops and use on free wifi networks),\nAND there are no ports open on your router that could be mapped to your Ubuntu machine,\nAND your router doesn't have any features which helpfully open ports for you based on things that happen on your network (UPnP)\nAND you will never have any other devices on your local network that might be compromised and attack your Ubuntu box,\nTHEN your system is probably secure without a host-based firewall.\nHowever, if some of these things aren't true, or might become untrue in the future, a host-based firewall is a really good idea.  Given the potential benefits and the limited drawbacks, why not enable it?\n\nA: None whatsoever.\nThe function of a firewall is to block access to services that otherwise would allow it.  Ubuntu has no listening services by default, so there is nothing to block.  Further, since you are behind a NAT router, you already effectively have a firewall.\n\nA: I think one of the most used firewall feature is to prevent \"cracked\" programs to check the license on internet. If the \"cracked\" application doesn't need to be update or doesn't use \"online\" features, you can prevent it to accessing the internet by setting up a specific firewall rule. Sad but true.\n\nA: In general cases, being either public computers or computers without a secure connection such as those more or less hijacking internet connections from other users in adjacent ports (i.e. houses/apartments next door), then that alone - I think - would give an example of how a firewall (being discretion) could be the better part of valor, so to speak.  Plus, they keep those around you from digging into your information whether it be personal or even just something goofy you might be screwing around with.  The point is privacy.\nWhen I say general, again, I mean places like public venues.  Libraries where all and sundry before you use portable carriers such as USB anything, really, discs - even if you were to do something possibly rash such as take your own external hard drive elsewhere and plug it in, there's no guarantee that the subsequent port is protected by virus or spyware blockers and all of that could latch on and carry itself right back to your original home laptop/desktop, thus making itself at home.\nSo while there might not be a vehement need in a lot of cases for a firewall to protect against a lot of things, they certainly come in handy against certain - if isolated - cases.\n\nA: In between, I found some interesting considerations about firewall.\nThe article explains the notion of \"service listening\", \"open port\" and \"NAT router\" which can be misunderstood to conclude that : \n- better with than without (even if you drive a tank, put your seatbelt on) and\n- think twice before doing something affecting the system (educational considerations) \n", "Q: Connect to MySQL on Ubuntu Server The connection worked fine the other day and for some reason is doesn't.

I recommend you Ubuntu 12.04. After that you will have an ISO file.\nYou need to put the ISO file in your USB stick from your mac. Now you have a USB flash drive where you can boot Ubuntu.\nAll that you have to do is configure your BIOS to boot from the USB stick, save your changes, plug it and reboot. Now you can choice the Try Ubuntu option and do what you want to. And if you like it, you can easily install it erasing Windows Vista or trying other options too.\nNOTE: your mac system will not be harmed, because you are using it to download a file and install it into a USB flash drive.

I'm really new to using terminal and I've been following guide blindly without knowing why is that there and what does it do..though this guides help me in installing the vmware player.\nthis one worked for me since making the file executable, clicking the file, and run..only say root access is needed.\nsudo sh vmwareplayer.txt (renamed it to be shorter)\nSomehow I know what sudo does but what does sh do? Without it it goes \"vmwareplayer.txt not found\". And for bundle files why does it end with .txt?\n\nA: In Ubuntu, sh or /bin/sh just points to dash. sh is supposed to run default command interpreter, which is dash for Ubuntu.1 dash refers to Debian Almquist shell. \nA shell is a command line interpreter for the system. There are several other shells like bash, csh, zsh etc. Here is a brief excerpt from man page of dash:  \n\n\n The shell is a command that reads lines from either a file or the termi‐\n nal, interprets them, and generally executes other commands.  It is the\n program that is running when a user logs into the system (although a user\n can select a different shell with the chsh(1) command).  The shell imple‐\n ments a language that has flow control constructs, a macro facility that\n provides a variety of features in addition to data storage, along with\n built in history and line editing capabilities.  It incorporates many\n features to aid interactive use and has the advantage that the interpre‐\n tative language is common to both interactive and non-interactive use\n (shell scripts).  That is, commands can be typed directly to the running\n shell or can be put into a file and the file can be executed directly by\n the shell.\n\n\n\nThere are lot of tutorials about Linux shells, you can start with this Wikipedia Article.\nComing to your question, if you write sh file, dash executes file for you.\n\nA: I believe that none of the earlier responders answered the question you actually asked G., so I'll take a shot at it. Interposing the sh when executing a program as you mentioned, executes the program in a non-interactive subshell. Non-interactive shells behave differently (e.g. initialisation) \nfrom the standard interactive shell you were using when you ran the program.\nHonestly I don't know what practical effect this has. As you noticed sh vmwareplayer.txt is (usually) able to execute something in the same folder, where simply typing vmwareplayer.txt (usually) will not. That has to do shell environment; it isn't any quality native to the shell or subshell itself. You can of course directly execute a program in the current directory as root: sudo ./vmwareplayer.txt. In my experience this always works just as well as sudo sh vmwareplayer.txt. I was hoping someone would come along and explain why the subshell was sometimes desirable.\n\nA: sh stands for \"shell\" and shell is the old, Unix like command line interpreter. An interpreter is an program that executes specific instructions written in a programming or scripting language. So basically you say \"Execute that file for me\".\nYou must understand that Linux doesn't really look at the file extension in order to determine what the file (or program) is. So as long as the content of that file is written in a way that the sh interpreter understands, it will work. But just for the sake of readability, such files are normally given an .sh extension and I have no idea what the developer was thinking when he gave that file a .txt extension..\n\nA: Just a word of comment:\nsudo executes a command with root privileges. When you call sudo vmwareplayer.txt which clearly means \"run command vmwareplayer.txt with root access\" and fails, because there is no such program.\nsudo sh command means \"execute sh command with root privileges\"\nand sh command will execute a command under Bourne shell.\nNew question arises. What are shells? This is a longer question and you will find some info on wiki I suppose.\nMeanwhile, remember man is your best friend.\n\nA: The sh utility is a command language interpreter/a command that executes commands read from a command line string, the standard input, or a specified file. The application ensures that the commands to be executed are expressed in the language described in Shell Command Language.\nFor example: \nThe following executes a shell command from a string:\nsh -c \"cat myfile.txt\"\n i.e. executes the command-- cat myfile.txt\nRefer to the following link for in-depth explanation: http://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/009695399/utilities/sh.html \n", "Q: Why does Ubuntu 12.10 update to 13.04 on its own?

Uniquely, with Pidgin you can log in to multiple accounts simultaneously. This means that you can be chatting with friends on AIM, flirting with contacts on Yahoo! - all whilst nattering away to your MSN buddies - all at the same time. Pidgin supports the usual IM features such as file transfer, customised status/nick names, away messages and typing notification. 'Simple' and 'Clean' are two words i would use to describe Pidgin's interface. from http://www.tuxmachines.org/node/47484\n", "Q: How can I use my TP-LINK TL-WN7200ND?

Skill Ripjaw X 8GB 2133MHz Ram, Crucial M4 256 GB SSD (GPT formatted), 2TB Seagate Barracuda, EVGA FTW 670, ASUS P8Z77-V Pro board (UEFI configured), CM Modular 850W PSU, LG BH-12 BluRay drive, Windows 8 x64 UEFI already installed.\nMy main question is, how should I go about installing Ubuntu, I would prefer to have it run on the SSD on which I already have Win8 installed. I have read on a tutorial, that Ubuntu has problems with running next to Win8 on an SSD, is this true? Should I run Ubuntu on the 2TB HDD (which I rather not due to performance differences). If running on the SSD, how much space of the SSD should I allocate to Ubuntu (currently 120GB free space)?\nHow should I partition the SSD or HDD depending on which to use. I read on this forum that Ubuntu will wear off the SSD if I don't tweak some stuff, what are those tweaks?\nAre there any settings or things I should consider in the BIOS?

Although there are a few things to consider.\n\n\n*\n\n*make a backup before installing ubuntu!\n\n*disable Fastboot in Windows 8 because it can cause issues (you can find it in the energy options)\n\n\n\nhow much space of the SSD should I allocate to Ubuntu (currently 120GB free space)?\n\nMy Ubuntu 12.10 installation currently takes 5,2GB with some essential programs installed. My / (root) partition has 20GB in total and I think that's fine. The rest goes for the /home partition. \nI also have a 4GB swap partition (size of RAM) but this is not really necessary. You could also make a swap file on the root partition and save those 8 GB for your data. With your 8 GB of RAM a swap partition is only needed for using hibernation. I would advice some Google search for swap files in this case.\n\nHow should I partition the SSD or HDD depending on which to use\n\n/ ~20GB\n/home available rest\n\nI read on this forum that Ubuntu will wear off the SSD if I don't tweak some stuff, what are those tweaks?\n\nAs far as I know Ubuntu by default mounts all partitions with the relatime (like noatime) parameter which reduces the access activity and increases the lifetime of your SSD. So there is no action required.\nWhat you should do is triggering the TRIM command from time to time. Simply run this for all your partitions located on your SSD in your terminal:\nsudo fstrim -v /\nsudo fstrim -v /home\n\nYou can also let Ubuntu do this for you by creating a cronjob. Just create a file e.g. named batched_discard in /etc/cron.weekly/ for weekly execution or in /etc/cron.daily/ for daily execution. And then paste the code from above into this created file.\nThere is also an option to mount some of your logging folders like /var/log as a tmpfs in your RAM to reduce the write operations on your SSD. But this way all log files are gone after rebooting your system. I wouldn't recommend it. Current SSD are strong enough to handle this in my opinion.\n\nAre there any settings or things I should consider in the BIOS? I have looked around for Intel Rapid Technology and couldn't find it, no info on ASUS website either.\n\nThe important setting in your Bios is that the AHCI option is set for your SDD. This should be a standard setting. As far as I know you can't change it if there is already something installed on this device. So be careful with that.\n\nI have looked around for Intel Rapid Technology and couldn't find it, no info on ASUS website either. What other things should I consider? My memory is currently set manually to run on 2133 MHz, is that okay for Ubuntu 12.10?\n\nI have no idea what Intel Rapid Technology is, I wouldn't bother about it. If your system runs without crashes your RAM MHz setting should be no problem. This is nothing ubuntu specific.\n\nAlso I ran Ubuntu from the install DVD to see if it works, and I had issues with the dual monitor setup main monitor Samsung 24\" (1920*1080) secondary monitor Samsung 17\" (1280*1024).When I turned both monitors on to their native resolution in Ubuntu, they both lost signal.\n\nSince you are using a NVIDIA card I would suggest using the proprietary nvidia driver and see if that works.

In late February 2013 I installed the latest updates on my Ubuntu 12.04 system (an Asus Eee 1215T), rebooted, and after that it was no longer able to make a network connection over wi-fi. It just repeatedly asks me for the WPA password. I enter it, but the connection is not made and it asks for the password again. I have made no changes to the wi-fi router for at least 6 months, and other wi-fi devices I have still connect without trouble. The only thing that changed was the Ubuntu update.\nUpdate: After some digging, I have found the problem and a solution. Close reading of /var/log/syslog revealed that the computer was connecting to the wi-fi router without trouble, but it was failing the DHCP negotiation.

Cause once I was running Ubuntu from livedisk, and it was showing that it was using a lot of swap.. but when you run in livedisk Ubuntu wouldnt have swap available? (or at least you'd hope it wouldn't just start writing stuff into a hardrive og host PC?). Although there was a swap partition in that machine, could livedisk use it??\n\nA: That is a design feature built into the kernel itself. In Linus (Torvalds) we trust!\nYou can try to adjust some of the behavioral characteristics, but on a low-level, the kernel only considers them suggestions. (google 'swapiness')\nOften times, swap can be assumed to reside on hard memory. If a program wants a little extra protection from crashes it might request a temp file be synced to disk (which could end up on swap). Then after a crash, a dirty swap can be detected and some data recovery attempted.\nYou might be surprised how frequently small amounts of data are written to swap (attempt to mount your swap on an old USB drive and you will feel the pain when it starts blocking!)\n", "Q: Automatic hyphenation software Resulting from a discussion over at the Graphic Design StackExchange site about if and how to justify text it is generally concluded that justification is preferred if the text is hyphenated in a proper way (to avoid whitespaces and rivers).\nThe related questions are\nJustification and hyphenation without proper time and tools?\nReadability and appeal of justified text\nDoes hyphenation increase legibility?\nAn answer to the first link suggests LaTeX but I wonder if there are other programs or tools (for example an extension for LibreOffice) to hyphenate text.\n\nA: Hyphenation is implemented in LibreOffice Writer 3.5.

I am on an intranet that is not connected to the Internet and a Wi-Fi router with connection to the Internet. When I am connected to the wireless network, I can browse the Internet, but I cannot browse my LAN with my Ethernet cable connected.\nHow can I browse the Internet via my Wi-Fi router and at the same time browse my local LAN web application via my connected Ethernet cable?\n\nA: You sure can. You didn't specify it, but I'm assuming you get the IP address automatically (via DHCP) both on wireless and wired connection.\nWired Ethernet is faster than wireless, so if there are two ways to get somewhere, wired will takes precedence over Wi-Fi by default. With that said, when you connect to both links, both DHCP servers by default will advertise themselves as the default gateway for all of the traffic.\nSo now your computer thinks it has two ways to connect to the Internet, and since wired is preferred it'll send traffic for the Internet via Ethernet. If that's the case, you would see two gateways for default networks 0.0.0.0 in your routing table, route -n, one with your wireless router as a gateway and one for the wired.\nBut the Metric for the Ethernet gateway would be lower than wireless, so your PC will send the packets there. Now that your Ethernet router gets them, it doesn't know what to do with them, so it just drops them. The order where you connected first shouldn't matter.\nAs far as fixing (this assumes the DHCP case), the correct way would be to tell the LAN router to stop advertising itself as the default gateway. You need to log in to the router and look through settings. If you have no control over the router, you can remove it from your end with:\nroute del default gw eth.router.ip.address\n\n\nA: Ubuntu's Network Manager now comes with a cool feature to isolate an interface for local resources only. This feature allows you to specify an interface (like a VPN or a LAN connection) as local-only and not to be used for outbound internet connections.\nFrom your WiFi menu, go to Edit Connections and then select the ethernet connection you would like to edit. Then, go to the IPv4 Settings tab, and click on the Routes button. Check the box labeled Use this connection only for resources on its network:\n\nDo the same to the IPv6 Settings tab if necessary. Then, finally, disconnect and reconnect the altered interface.\nNow, Ubuntu will intelligently not route internet-bound traffic through this interface.\n\nAlternatively, you can do the same thing from the command-line. cd over to /etc/NetworkManager/system-connections and find the interface you want to target.\nOpen it with sudo nano <your targeted interface> and add the following text below the [ipv4] and [ipv6] headers:\nnever-default=true\n\nYour finished file should look something like:\n...\n\n[ipv4]\ndns-search=\nmethod=auto\nnever-default=true\n\n[ipv6]\naddr-gen-mode=stable-privacy\ndns-search=\nip6-privacy=0\nmethod=auto\nnever-default=true\n\nNote that with the command-line method, you will need to disconnect and re-connect to the network to allow these settings to take place.\n\nA: I still do not have enough information for giving you an answer in which I am 100% confident, but here are a few hypothesis.\n\n\n*\n\n*When connected on the cabled LAN, you are on a different subnet than when using the Wireless LAN. The routing between these 2 LAN is not configured, and thus when requesting an IP range that is not in the current active LAN, the packet are sent to the \"default\" interface, usually the gateway/router.\n\n*You have both Wireless and wired connection active, but the wired one is activated after the wireless and whatever network management tool you are using is just replacing the route table entries with the last activated connection. Thus, when you activate the wired connection, the previous routing table is \"cancelled/removed\". You may need to adjust the routing manually in your network management tool.\n\n", "Q: Problem with microphone sound when using Skype 4.1. 0.20 on Ubuntu 10.04.4 I have Ubuntu 10.04.4 installed in my machine ( Acer 3810 T).

I have install the above mentioned sound mixer, however still the problem remains. The AUDACITY recording tells me that the system microphone is otherwise fine. Hence right now I am clueless as to what might be the problem and the only thing I can conclude is there some bug in the recent kernel updates that  I made. \nAny immediate suggestion for solving this issue would be of much help ! \n\nA: We may need another sound profile to be able to connect both, the microphone, and the audio for telephony usage.\nTo change the audio profile used with PulesAudio open \"Sound Preferences.../Hardware, and try with the \"Duplex\" profile.\n\nAudio profiles can also be changed with pavucontrol  in case it is installed.\nA solution from a previous answer suggested to switch microphone to mono by disabling one channel.\nDisclaimer: unfortunately we can not test this possible solution, as we don not have Skype installed in our 10.04 test system, and a proprietary sound access may be used by Skype in this release.\n\nA: I've hit a similar problem with sound recording during and after a Skype call in Ubuntu Lucid:\nafter a reboot, sound recording works (tested through arecord, record, audacity). When making a Skype call, for several first seconds sound is recorded ore or less fine (that's why when doing the Skype echo test it might seem that it works), but then most or all of the sound is omitted (so that ultimatey the other end hears only silence). After exiting from Skype, all recording test also fail, the recording results in an almost zero-length silence recording: ith arecord or audacity).\nI've found out that pulseaudio is involved by default between Skype and the sound card.\nSo as a test, I've disabled pulseaudio (to see whether the problems would disappear): sudo chmod a-x /usr/bin/pulseaudio\nAnd indeed, the problems have gone away.\nSo my simple recommendation is to disable pulseaudio (preferably--for those with basic Unix knowledge but without a  wish to learn about pulseaudio configuration--simply by making it non-executable, because the correct way --deisntalling the package--might cause too much trouble with the dependencies).\nAs the next step, there is another issue to resolve, if you want to have a nice desktop environment: after you disable pulseaudio, the sound volume/mixer applet isn't working anymore because it relies on pulseaudio. So, you have to get another volume/mixer applet that is able to work directly with ALSA.\nSolution for the mixer applet problem: among the mixers available in Ubuntu Lucid, the only one that can be minimized into an applet is kmixer (from KDE4). So, I've installed kmixer, configured it, and added it to the autostarts in the preferences menu.\n\nA: I always find that unticking the skype default voice setup works when I install skype on PCs. \nStart Skype normally.\nNavigate down to Options>Sound Devices.\nSpot the button below and untick it\n\nAs you can see I also have pulse audio running and they can sometimes conflict.\nLet us know how you get on.\n", "Q: Why does Wireless function key not effect the wireless card but only Bluetooth?

On that hard drive is a encryption program that boots up called \"safeboot\", you enter your username and password and then Windows boots up.  Wanting to use this for personal use I removed the CD drive and installed a 2nd hard drive bay instead.  On the 2nd hard drive I loaded Linux Mint 14 and was using it for months.  Then I wanted to try Ubuntu 12.10 so I partitioned the 2nd hard drive and installed 12.10.  Now when booting up if I choose to boot from the first hard drive it goes straight into the grub boot loader.  If I remove the 2nd hard drive and boot up it says grub is missing.  Any thoughts?\n\nA: \n\"Now when booting up if I choose to boot from the first hard drive it goes straight into the grub boot loader.\"\n\nIn order to understand what's going on here, you need to understand exactly how Grub works. Because a bootloader installed to a hard-drive's MBR (Master Boot Record) must not be larger than 512 bytes, Grub is divided into two stages:\n\n\n*\n\n*Stage 1 consists of a very small program. This program's sole purpose is to load and run Stage 2. The actual process for doing this depends on your version of Grub. An important point to note here is that Stage 1 must be able to find Stage 2 in order to run it.\n\n*Stage 2 is responsible for displaying the menu you see when you boot and actually passing control over to the selected operating system.\nWhen installing Ubuntu, the installer typically copies Stage 1 to the MBR of the first disk. Because you installed Ubuntu to the second disk, Stage 2 was likely installed there.\n\n\"If I remove the 2nd hard drive and boot up it says grub is missing.\"\n\nThis is because Stage 2 (which, if you remember, is responsible for actually displaying the menu) is located on the disk you removed.\n\n\"Any thoughts?\"\n\nGrub is capable of chainloading Windows - this means that Grub simply invokes Windows' own bootloader as if it had been directly invoked by the BIOS. If Windows isn't showing up in the Grub menu, then the problem is that Grub isn't detecting the Windows installation.\n", "Q: How to evaluate an arithmetic expression in an \"if\" statement?

This seems to be because there is an underlying problem with your disk.  You should investigate the cause of that with dmesg.\n", "Q: Fix BOOTMGR from Ubuntu? I installed Ubuntu 12.10 on my computer and decided to go to Windows XP. I inserted the reinstall CD and it just says:\n\nBOOTMGR Missing, click CTRL+ALT+DEL to restart.\n\nThe same thing happens with Windows 7. I'm assuming that the BOOTMGR needs to be restored/repaired but I don't know how to do that in Ubuntu. I've read many articles that say to insert the install CD and use the command prompt but seeing as I can't even load the CD that is a problem. So basically my question is, how do I replace/reinstall the BOOTMGR through Ubuntu?\n\nA: *\n\n*Have you checked the boot priority on your Bios? Re-check if your CD drive is first on your boot.\n\n*If you somehow manage to get to the Windows 7 repair console type in the following commands: \nbootrec.exe /FixMBR\nbootrec.exe /FixBoot \n\n\n*If you can boot your Ubuntu dist, you can try using a partitioning software (like disk utility), select the partition where you installed it (probably labeled System), right click the partition and mark it as boot.\n", "Q: Is swap memory required on a flash drive installation? I have Ubuntu 12.10 installed on a 16gig flash drive without a swap partition. I heard from many users that skipping swap on installing Ubuntu on flash drives extends the speed and life of a flash drive significantly (Kingston CS says they've yet received flash drives \"worn out\" from installed OS use).\nMy flash installation runs very well, though sometimes there is some sluggishness with Firefox working with image laden sites, or with Gimp, but I don't know whether to fault that specifically to swap.\nOn the whole there are no crippling performance issues. My question is would there be any real performance improvements had I installed swap (since I might format another Ubuntu flash drive)?\n\nA: Skip swap on flash drive installations unless you put it on a separate thumb.  It becomes non-portable unless you switch from UUIDs back to disk label for mounting.\nWhat you heard about disk life is correct.\nSluggish isn't necessarily lack of swap.  There's nowhere near enough detail to pin your sluggishness down.\n", "Q: How do I add QtDeclarative to the pkg-config list I installed today the libqt5 and QtQuick development stacks.  In trying to also install the hsqml packages for Haskell, hsqml reports that QtDeclarative is not listed in pkg-config.  However, I have installed libqt5declarative5 and found both an i386 and x86_64 version of libQtDeclarative.so.4.8.1 on my filesystem.\nSo, how do I get pkg-config to add those files to the listing so that other applications can find them?\n\nA: After more research, it would appear that the difference is that I have installed QT 5 in order to do development, and QtDeclarative has been subsumed into other components for QT 5.  The HsQML library is apparently designed for older versions of QT.  So the answer is that I should not be adding QtDeclarative to pkg-config at all, but should instead be looking to port HsQML to QT 5.\n", "Q: Installing a Brother MFC-240C on 12.10 I recently installed Ubuntu 12.10, 64-bit, with encryption, on my laptop.  I've got an old Brother MFC-240C that's connected via a USB port.  I was able to locate the appropriate drivers on the Brother web site:\n\n\n*\n\n*mfc240clpr-1.0.1-1.i386.rpm and\n\n*mfc240ccupswrapper-1.0.1-1.i386.rpm\nand install them.  My laptop sees the printer, and detects when I unplug it or turn it off, but when I try to send print jobs to it, it doesn't respond. The printer worked fine when I had Windows installed on my laptop, so I know it's not that.\nHas anyone run into this problem?  Any pointers would be helpful.\n\nA: You need to choose your printer from the 'Model' tab in the printer options (System settings/printers). Just click over whatever occupies the space to the right the word 'model', and click on 'select from database'. It'll be under Brother, prolly something like 'MFC-240clpr(cups)'. \nBy the way, don't worry about the .rpm file, it's usable only for Linux distros using RedHat. Just use both the LPR & cupswrapper .deb's version from here... \nhttp://welcome.solutions.brother.com/bsc/public_s/id/linux/en/download_prn.html#MFC-240C\n", "Q: Headphone jack disabled in windows, after using Ubuntu I installed Ubuntu 12.10 on my Alienware M15x-R1 and love it, but whenever I properly shut down or reboot from within Ubuntu, when I access Windows my headphone jack doesn't work, it reads headphones are plugged in but it doesn't send sound, essentially it's muted. This wasn't happening before Ubuntu. The jack works fine in Ubuntu. All drivers are updated. \nWhen I manually force shut down with my power button, the headphone works, so Ubuntu is somehow muting my jack when shutting down. Is there anyway to prevent this or not allow Ubuntu access to Windows privileges? Something? I love Ubuntu and plan on continuing to use it, but manually shutting down each time is going to be a pain and is really only a temporary solution, any help is greatly appreciated!\n\nA: I don't have a full and fool-proof solution that I can offer, but I do know that this happens with some hardware, where the headphone jack sense is \"muted\" by ALSA.\nTo turn it back on, you can use alsamixer:\n\nMy screenshot does not display the option for headphone jack sense because my card does not support it, but it is similar to the S/PDIF option. Select it with your keyboard ← and → and press M to mute or unmute it. These settings should stick with the system even when you reboot.\nDepending on your sound card configuration, it may also be another option in ALSA's configuration that causes the problem, so if it doesn't work, be sure to look for any suspect features. You can also expand on your problem in your question (with a screenshot of your sound card options from alsamixer if this doesn't work, and I'll see if I can give an update to my answer.\n", "Q: Is there a way to pull source for a package for a specific release? Is there a way to pull source for a package (apt-get source) but specify the release? For example, I'd love to be able to just run apt-get source --raring python-imaging. I know I can manually pull from packages.ubuntu.com, is there a tool that can do this for me?\n\nA: Kind of.\nAssuming you have that release in your sources.list you can do something like this.\napt-get source python-imaging/raring\n\nOf course, if you are going to put other releases in your system sources.list you will also need to put appropriate pinning in place, or your regular use of apt-get will suffer. A better option then, in my opinion, is to use a separate apt environment, temporarily pointing to it using the APT_CONFIG environment variable.\nThe link below point to a blog post on how I put those pieces together for apt-get download. The exact same principle applies for apt-get source, just that you instead need the deb-src entries in your custom sources.list.\nhttp://blog.bogosity.se/2012/11/03/fully-using-apt-get-download/\n", "Q: multitouch gestures in GNOME-Shell I switched from Unity to GNOME, and I really miss the gestures on Unity (3 fingers window moving, expand to maximize, etc).\nI have two finger scrolling and two finger tap to right click out of the box on GNOME, but is there any way to configure these additional gestures?

Nothing is changed.\nAdditional Information:\n\n\n*\n\n*OS   : Ubuntu 12.04 64-bit\n\n*VM   : Linux Mint 14 Cinnamon/MATE 64-bit\n\n\nI created new vdi disk and tried to start it from .iso image.\nVirtualbox Settings:\n\n\n*\n\n*Num of processors : 4\n\n*Memory : 512 MB\n\n*Video Memory : 128 MB\n\n*3D Acceleration: Enabled\n\n\nA: The error message is pretty self explanatory. The VM you are trying to start needs hardware virtualization enabled. See the follwing Q&A on how to do so (provided your CPU is capable of this):\n\n\n*\n\n*How do I enable hardware virtualization technology (VT-x) for use in Virtualbox?\nIf this does not resolve the issue, the following steps may help:\n\n\n*\n\n*Reboot the host OS  \n\n*Try with fewer virtual CPUs starting from 1 only   \n\n*disable VT-x settings in VBoxManager (reported to worked but I doubt this)\n\n*on a Hewlett Packard machine hardware VT-x could only be achieved with a BIOS update (source superuser.com)\n\n\nA: Click \"Discard\" (Discard the saved state) option (option from the virtual box manager) and try starting the virtual box once again it must work . this usually happens when your host operating system sleeps while your virtual machine is still active . Please note any unsaved data will be lost . \n\nA: It's that you need to run Virtualbox as an administrator. \n\nA: Yes, for me that was the issue. Run the VB as an administrator. Right click on the VB, and select \"Run as Administrator\"\n", "Q: Folder permissions changed automatically Hey guys first of all I searched a lot on this site but didnt get any exact answer to my questions.\nDont know something happened automatically and all the folders permissions changed automatically and there came a lock icon on all of my folders and files.\nThen I searched on this site and got the solution as this command \nsudo chown 777 -R $USER:$USER $HOME\n\nIt solved my problem half way, it removed the lock icon but now all folders permissions are read only so please guide me how to reset all the folder permissions as it was previously?\nI'm using ubuntu 12.10\nThanks\n\nA: DONT DO THIS!\nYou have written that you have done sudo chown 777 -R ${USER}:${USER} ${HOME}\n1. Problem\nYour are using sudo to do an operation which should normally change resources you're controlling with your current user. This is extremely unsafe.\n2. Problem\nYou are using sudo and environment variables.\nThis may lead you in to an error situation. For illustration try the following.\n\n\n*\n\n*sudo echo $USER  --> e.g. shivam\n\n*sudo echo '$USER' --> root\n3. Problem\nchown will change the ownership of a file.\nLuckily you have add a failure. The parameter 777 would be identified as user name that is not existing and the file ${USER}:${USER} is not found.\nThe command chmod is responsible for changing file or directory permissions.\nFixing the permissions of all folders below a distinct directory.\nUse the following to change the folder permissions below a distinct directory:\nfind BASEDIR -type d -exec chmod u+rwx \\{\\} \\;\n\nIn your case replace BASEDIR with ~. For the bash ~ will be replaced with the home directory of the current user.\nThis will process only directories (not files) and set the read, write and enter (aka execute) permissions for the owner of the directory.\nFor more informations please read man chmod \nNotes:\n\n\n*\n\n*Be careful with the recursive option -R because it will process all directories and files below the given directory.\n\n*Use the symbolic permission notation like u+rwx, because it is easier to understand.\n\n*Don't use sudo if you`re not realy need it. \n\n\nCheck that your filesystem is mounted correctly\nEnsure that the partition containing the problematic home directory is mounted read-write.\n  grep /home /proc/mounts  \n\nThis should give an similar output:\n\n/dev/mapper/system-home /home ext4 rw,relatime,discard,commit=600,data=ordered 0 0\n\nIf the rw option is not shown, then the partition is mounted for some reasons (e.g. inconsistency) read only.\nIf this is the case invoke a file system check.\nThis is normally also invoked during the boot of your computer.\n\nA: The biggest problem is that all of your files are in a state that, however readable now, they are pretty unusable.\nThe problem with setting permissions by hand is that not all files have the same permission set (think about your ssh-keys for instance, you don't want somebody else be able to read them) so you are in a messy situation where you have to decide for every single file which permissions they should have.\nThe best thing you can do is create a new account and copy the files you need from the old account. Permissions will then be set automatically. Also if you need your personal settings  you can copy them also from your old account. They are in hidden files or hidden directories in your home directory. Be careful to only copy what you need.\nAlso it might be wise to do a filesystemcheck afterwards.\n", "Q: ssh: connect to host xxxx@xxxx.in in port 22 : connection timed out I am new to Linux and SSH. when I try to connect to a remote grid computer (for which I have access) I am getting connection timed out error.

The bridge thus connects usb0 and eth0. I set it up by typing following commands on my laptop:\n$ ifconfig usb0 0.0.0.0 promisc up\n$ brctl addbr br0\n$ brctl addif br0 usb0 eth0\n$ ifconfig br0 up\n\nNow the other computer (connected to my laptop via ethernet) can connect to the internet. I now use following commands to restore the internet connection on my laptop:\n$ ifconfig br0 192.168.42.200 up\n$ route del default\n$ route add default gw 192.168.42.129 br0\n\nAfter this operation, route prints the following kernel ip routing table:\nKernel IP routing table\nDestination     Gateway         Genmask         Flags Metric Ref    Use Iface\ndefault         192.168.42.129  0.0.0.0         UG    0      0        0 br0\nlink-local      *               255.255.0.0     U     1000   0        0 usb0\n192.168.42.0    *               255.255.255.0   U     0      0        0 br0\n192.168.42.0    *               255.255.255.0   U     1      0        0 usb0\n\nEverything works fine, both computers can connect to the internet, but then suddenly my laptop looses the connection.\nI found that this happens because the kernel ip routing table was modified. route now gives following output:\nKernel IP routing table\nDestination     Gateway         Genmask         Flags Metric Ref    Use Iface\ndefault         192.168.42.129  0.0.0.0         UG    0      0        0 usb0\nlink-local      *               255.255.0.0     U     1000   0        0 usb0\n192.168.42.0    *               255.255.255.0   U     1      0        0 usb0\n\nApparently Ubuntu does not like to be connected via br0 and thus switches back to usb0. The connection can be restored though, by again resetting the route table:\n$ route del default\n$ route add default gw 192.168.42.129 br0\n\nUnfortunately, after a few moments the connection is lost again. Once it would even last for 5 minutes before Ubuntu decided to kill it again.\nHow can I prevent Ubuntu from modifying the kernel ip routing table?\n\nA: Ok, in case anyone else has the same problem, here is how I solved it: I simply disabled the network manager by typing following command:\n$ stop network-manager\n\nNote that the network manager clears the routing table and brings down all connections before it exits, so you have to bring back up all interfaces that you need.\nI had to additionally type following commands for my bridge to work again:\n$ ifconfig usb0 up\n$ ifconfig eth0 up\n\nFurther I needed to edit /etc/resolv.conf to get address resolution back to work. I added following lines, which sets the Google DNS servers as nameservers:\nnameserver 8.8.8.8\nnameserver 8.8.4.4\n\nNow everything works as expected, both computers have internet connection.\n", "Q: Unmount fuse mountpoints on logout? I have a couple of folders containing compressed data.\nI have one application which needs to access the uncompressed version of the same data.\nA simple way to solve that for me has been to run a script upon login looking something like this:\n#!/bin/bash\nrar2fs -o allow_other /home/user/source1        /home/user/target1\nrar2fs -o allow_other /home/user/source2        /home/user/target2\nrar2fs -o allow_other /home/user/source3        /home/user/target3\nrar2fs -o allow_other /home/user/source4        /home/user/target4\n\nTo get the script to run when I login was simple, I just added it using 'Startup Applications'.\nI just now realized however that my approach comes up short when I log out then back in again.\nMy guess is it works badly since the rar2fs/fuse mounts happen within my encrypted home folder. When I log out I think ubuntu locks the encryption, but my mount probably stick around even though both source and target are inaccessible.\nThen when I login again, adding insult to injury, I try to do the mount again. Leaving me with mountpoints that spit out errors like when I try to access them:\nError: Error when getting information for file '/home/user/target1':Transport endpoint is not connected\n\nMy guess is this could be prevented if I could just get the system to unmount properly on logout, but I don't know how to get a script to run upon logout.\nHow does one properly shut down a fuse mount before logout?\nEDIT: I'm using unity.\nEDIT:\nRunning fusermount -u using session-cleanup-script I get the following error:\nfusermount: bad mount point /home/user/target1: No such file or directory\n\nI've also tried adding the umount loop to my mount script so that it should umount the folders before mounting them if they are already mounted, but those umounts fail as well:\nfusermount: failed to unmount /home/user/target1: Invalid argument\n\nMy guess is that the first solution fails because the encrypted home locks before the cleanup-script is run. Perhaps there is some way to hook into the encryption routine and have a script run before the home folder locks?\nIf I run the umount-script manually before logging out the mountpoints work as expected when I login again.\n\nA: I have a problem similar to yours, except I use SSHFS. I think my solution can be easily adapted for your scenario.\nIn /etc/lightdm/lightdm.conf, under the section [SeatDefaults], the following option points to a file that runs when quitting a user session (runs as root):\nsession-cleanup-script=/path/to/file\n\nA fuse mount can be unmounted running fusermount -u /path/to/mount/point, but only the user who mounted it can unmount it. So I had to use su to change the user before fusermount -u. This is my logout script:\n#!/bin/bash\n\n# Change user\nif [ \"$EUID\" = \"0\" -a \"$USER\" != \"root\" ]; then\n    su -c $0 $USER &\n    exit 0\nfi\n\n# Unmount sshfs sharings at the end of the session\nfor MNTPOINT in `mount -t fuse.sshfs | grep -i \"user=$USER\" | cut -d\" \" -f 3`; do\n        fusermount -u $MNTPOINT\ndone\n\nexit 0\n\nAll you have to do is replace fuse.sshfs with the correct filesystem type, which you can find out in mount output.\n", "Q: set up mailserver for multiple domains guide for beginner I am not Linux pro, and after days of trying with tutorials how to set up postfix or other e-mail server I am try to find solution here.\nIn your office we have HP Proliant server with Ubuntu server 12.10. I installed configured, the mysql, apache2, php5, vnc, ssh, to provide webhosting for our clients (we do not provide DNS service). I tested it on multiple domains and subdomains everything is fine.\nNow I want to set up email server for our domain and for any other domain pointing to our ip adress. So if we create website for you client, we provide him and domain example.com with webhosting and also we want to provide him a email addresses like something@example.com.\nI red some tutorials with postfix + mysql for vitual users but lot of config files are in other location or main file is including others. So I cant find lot of things in included files and main file that tutorials is described. (They seems to be outdated) \nCan somebody provide me step by step instructions or ebook how to set up mailserver? From apt-get install to fetch messages with email client.\nin short:\n\n\n*\n\n*not virtualized\n\n*we do not provide dns service (We are using A record on domains)\n\n*test domain is from http://dot.tk  (soft-tech-srv.tk) using Dot.TK Free DNS service\n\n*System is Ubuntu server 12.10 amd64, with Xfcedesktop and SSH + VNC access\n\n*MySQL, Apache2, PHP5, FTP installed and configured\n\n*full email service is needed.\nThanks.\n\nA: The tutorial on www.howtoforge.com works perfectly to install postfix with courier and mysql for your situation using virtual users (so you don't need to open a Linux account for every mail user).\nThe config files used are on the default places if you install with apt-get. It is long  but basically it installs everything using apt-get, build the mysql queries to manage virtual users and mails (6 simple queries if remember well) and configure postfix main and master config files. You also install squirrelmail as webmail software.\n", "Q: Geany / Gedit: hex editor plugin Are there any plugins for Geany / Gedit to support reading binary/hex files?\n\nA: Perhaps you would be better off using a dedicated software. I confess that I have not used it but Bless looks interesting, as mentioned by the comment above (just saw it now...).\n\nA: I've written a script for the Geany Lua plugin that allows you to do hex editing.\nThe file is available from https://wiki.geany.org/config/scripts/lua\nYou just have to install the Geany Lua plugin (available via apt-get as geany-plugin-lua), copy the script into your config directory (~/.config/geany/plugins/geanylua), and restart Geany. The script will appear under Tools - Lua Scripts.\nIf you have the Bless hex editor, the script will open files in that. Otherwise, if you have xxd (which comes standard with vim), then it will allow you to edit the file as hex within Geany.\nFeedback is welcome!\n\nA: There is a simple trick in Geany I use for easy switching between Geany and GHex.\nActivate the built-in file browser plugin in Geany and go to its preferences to configure it. Check the option “Follow the path of the current file” and set an external open command, e. g. ghex -g 1024x768 \"%f\".\nNow open any file with Geany. If you want work on the hex code simply go into the built-in file browser (it's always in the right path) and use right click on your file and select “Open externally”. Geany will open the file in GHex automatically. After you are done with GHex, close it. If you have something changed in the file you just have to reload the file in Geany. It's a simple efficient workflow.\n", "Q: I need help running a script constantly for a vpn connection. how to go around the ping I am one of those who need to use vpnc for a connection with a net.

I use usually the one, my wife the other. Kids start to get older and use whatever is available.\nIt would be very handy, to have a centralized /home, for example an SSD attached to the router.\nHow do I achieve the following:\n\n\n*\n\n*User A on Laptop L1 is also the same user A on Latptop L2\n\n*synchronize content: As soon as content is saved on Laptop L1 by user A, it will get synced to L2 (either when the L2 is on, or latest when A logs into L2; I know that conflict management might be an issue here)\n\n*If the central home service becomes unavailable, a transparent shadow copy will be available. As soon as /home/ becomes available again, syncing starts.\n\n\nWhat I do not care:\n\n\n*\n\n*I do not care if L1 uses e.g. Libreoffice 4.0 and L2 Libreoffice 3.6 or L1 has Gimp installed while there is no Gimp at all on L2.\n\n\nBTW. I do not know the proper wording for \"Roaming profiles\" in the Unix world, another term?\n\nA: First,  note that the /home directory contains your personal configuration files for different programs as well as documents and data. For example, the config file for LibreOffice 4.0 may be slightly different from the 3.6 version and syncing them may create some problems. I will assume you only want to sync data and document files between L1 and L2 for user A.\nSoultion One: [Cloud]\nUse Ubuntu One to sync the Documents and any other folder you need between the two home folders of L1/A and L2/A. \nThe Ubuntu One comes pre-installed in Ubuntu. Start the program and create an account id you don't have one. \nOpen Nautilus and right click on the folder and and select \"Synchronize on Ubuntu One\" on both L1/A and L2/A.\nNote, This is an Internet based solution and has some limitations. For example, the free account only has 5GB of space. The sync won't work if there is not Internet connection. If you delete a file from L1 it will get deleted from L2 as soon as you login to L2.\nAdvantage, both L1 and L2 do not have to be turned on at the same time for the sync to work. \nSolution Two: [GUI Local solution]\nUse Unison, a folder syncing software on both L1 and L2. This is a bit harder to setup and is not as automated as Ubuntu One. Both the computers need to be turned on for sync to happen. \nIt may be better to have a Desktop (D1) that is always on and use that as the Unison server and sync L1 and L2 with D1. A how to setup is available for a slightly older version and another one is here. I am not describing the setups in these links here, as they each describe a slightly different setups than what you want.\nSolution Three: [Command Line and Scripts]\nUse the commands rsync and anacron to periodically sync L1 and L2. for example from L1:\nrsync -vxtr -e ssh [user]@[IP_address_of_L2]:/home/[user]/Documents/ /home/[user]/Documents/\n\nSee How to sync files/data between two PCs on a home network?.\nSee How can I run anacron in user mode? also. \nAs with Unison, both the L1 and L2  must be on for this to complete.\nThere may be other solutions.\nHope this helps\n", "Q: Recover failed RAID1 software Partition / missing partition table or superblock i already read & tried different approaches for 2 days now but nothing seems to work.\nI have 2 HDDs, on each one is an partition with 200GB which i had in RAID1.

I have recently switched to the habit of checking my email only twice a day -- one hour after I come to the office and one hour before I leave. Each time I have processed any received messages I close Thunderbird. In between those occasions I sometimes want to reread a message or access an attachment and then I don't want Thunderbird to show me any new messages upon startup.\nI have unchecked:\n\nCheck for new messages at startup\nCheck for new messages every N minutes\n\nand (in the advanced section):\n\nUse IDLE command if the server supports it\n\nStill when Thunderbird starts it checks for new messages. Is there a way to disable this IMAP synchronization?\n\nA: IMAP is designed to be always-on so when Thunderbird starts, it's only natural that it wants to check what's happened since last time. If you want a polling-based model, you might want POP3 but even then an initial check is the sane thing to do.\nBy extension, the \"check for messages at startup\" option only really works for polled email methods like POP3 where the client does have to go out and \"fetch\" batches of new messages. With IMAP, it's just connecting (as it needs to) and sees them.\nI have a few options for you:\n\n\n*\n\n*You can start Thunderbird in offline-mode by calling thunderbird -offline. You won't go online (so won't have access to most of your messages) until you switch to it from inside Thunderbird.\n\n*You could use a timed DNS blocker. Things like Stay Focussed  and Get Shit Done are scripts that block the DNS for certain hosts so you are required to live without those servers. I'm suggesting you add your email host to that list. Might work. See:\n\n\n*\n\n*How to block websites temporarily?\n\n\n*Use a caching IMAP server. Something that fetches your mail from the real IMAP server and presents it as another IMAP server. You switch Thunderbird to reach into your local server and then it can check as much as it likes and it's not wasting bandwidth.\nThe obvious problem here is the time spent setting this up. Add the delay you'll get before new messages hit your inbox and you might be less tempted. Oh yeah and you'll want this to be secure. Shouldn't be too much of a pain if this local only, but keep that in mind.\nIf you want to persue this route, I'd suggest something like fetchmail for the grabbing and dovecot for the local serving.\n\nA: It's true that IMAP is set up to check emails 'instantly' but that only works if you have the \"Use IDLE command if the server supports it\" box checked. If that box is unchecked then the email will be checked for new messages every x minutes defined in Account Settings > Server Settings > 'Check for new messages every x minutes'.\nThis doesn't answer the scheduling that you'd like to do but can allow for long periods of time between checks to be set.\n\nA: See http://kb.mozillazine.org/Outbox\nTools – Options –> Advanced –> Network & Disk Space, and press the Offline… button\nTo configure some settings relating to online and offline states, choose Tools – Options –> Advanced –> Network & Disk Space, and press the Offline… button. You can configure Thunderbird's state when it starts up, how Thunderbird alerts you to the presence of unsent messages in your Outbox, and whether Thunderbird ensures that all available messages are downloaded before going offline. \n", "Q: Xubuntu 12.10 : Can't add account to network application When I try to add an account to Gwibber/Pidgin (which are not system apps), it sends me to the System parameters.

I tried it on ACHI, but there was no problems with dmraid and grub\n\nHere's another problem :\n\nSo i bought a lenovo u410 the other day to use with linux along side\n  my windows pc, problem is when i get to the installation screen the\n  hard drives dont show up (500gb hdd or 32gb ssd) i also took off\n  acceleration and put the hard drives in non raid mode but that still\n  didnt work, i also tried wubi to see if it would run for kicks but\n  that wont work either, can anyone help me out?\n\n\nA: You can use 'wubi' installer given in the ubuntu download image file.\nJust extract the downloaded image file of ubuntu (whatever version, no matter) and copy the 'wine.exe' and place it in a folder again with the downloaded image file of ubuntu in the same directory.\nNow just double click the 'wine.exe' file. Now it will ask you to allocate some space for ubuntu (Note: ~18GB space is by default selected). Give the password and let it do other for you.\nIt will ask to reboot. Just reboot and on the next start you will see installing ubuntu. Just follow the on screen steps and you are done.\nNow on each start, it will ask you to choose OS to start. Just give your choice as ubuntu (if you want) and use ubuntu.\nIt will work as dual boot OS parallel to windows.\nThe great thing is that you can remove it whenever you wish just as you remove other installed programs from windows. Just boot into windows, and go to 'Remove/Uninstall Programs' and uninstall 'wubi' and 'ubuntu'. Now you are done..\nEnjoy.\n\nA: Problem:\nIf Intel smart response is enabled, Ubuntu 13.04 installation would not be able to detect your accelerated hard drive, which in my case is where the Windows 8 partition is located and where I intend to install dual boot Ubuntu 13.04. \nYou will notice no \"Install alongside Windows\" option. During installation, you can't see dev/dsa1 which is the accelerated hard drive with Windows 8, if you choose \"something else\" installation method.\nSolution:\n\n\n*\n\n*Boot into Windows 8 and disable smart response in Intel rapid storage GUI.\nFollow Install Windows 8 with \"Intel smart response\" technology if you do not know how and reboot. After disabling it, if you still can't see your hard drive, try reset the cache to available.\n\n*Install Ubuntu 13.04 following this guide here.\n\n\n*\n\n*Dual-boot Windows 8 and Ubuntu 12.10 in UEFI mode\n\n\n*Reboot and re-enable smart response in Windows 8\n\n*Reboot and you should be able to boot into Ubuntu 13.04.\n\n\n\nTroubleshoot:\n\n\n*\n\n*If disabling smart response in Windows GUI causes your boot issue, boot into Windows recovery console using recovery media or installation media and type each of the following:\nchkdsk /f            #Run diskcheck for your Windows installation drive.\nbootrec /fixmbr\nbootrec /fixboot\nbootrec /scanos\nbootrec /rebuildbcd\n\nIf the above command still can't fix the boot problem , download NTBOOTautofix v2.5.7.zip and run the file in any USB windows PE system. For example, My_7PE – Build Windows 7 PE without WAIK. It will automatically fix almost all Windows 7/8/NT/XP/Vista problems.\n\n*\nAfter setting up Easy BCD, if you see the above legacy boot image instead of the modern metro boot menu, go to easyBCD and set Windows 8 as default boot OS, save setting, run cmd as administrator and type bcdedit /set {default} bootmenupolicy standard.

I took into consideration this answer - How to boot Ubuntu from SSD drive which cannot be selected as boot device? - and basically these are the steps that I followed:\n\n\n*\n\n*Deleted the info from the SSD\n\n*Converted the SSD to MBR \n\n*Created a small partition for /boot on the main HDD (~200 MB)\n\n*Selected from BIOS the SSD as the primary boot partition\n\n*When the installation began, I created on the SSD a partition for / and one for swap\n\n*Although the SSD theoretically was MBR, it complained about not having a BIOS Boot Partition, so I also created one for the bios-grub.\n\n\nEverything worked fine, except for the fact that after the restart, the system did not recognize the SSD anymore and I was unable to select it as the main boot device. Furthermore, if I use diskpart, it shows that the SSD is GPT, and not MBR, although I initially converted it to MBR.\nDo you have any idea on how could I fix this?\n\nA: *\n\n*Try examining your firmware boot options. Look for options to enable CSM, BIOS, or legacy boot features; or to disable EFI or UEFI boot features.\n\n*Launch Linux's fdisk (not gdisk, parted, or GParted) and use the a option to set the \"bootable flag\" on the one partition that you should see. Use the w option to save changes.\n\n*If neither of the above works, consult this page of mine, which goes into more detail about this problem and provides more obscure possible workarounds.\n\n", "Q: What is the fundamental GUI library for Ubuntu starting with 12.04? I have started exploring deeply into doing development for the Ubuntu phone.  In the past, and having used stock Ubuntu, I always found that GTK was the standard GUI library.  But now, with the phone development, I'm starting to see QML being the one that they encourage, and this uses QT.\nSo, which is the standard?  Has it changed?  How many of my applications are written in GTK and how many are actually in QT with good theme ?\n\nA: It has taken me more than a year to find the answer to this, but Cannonical has finally made their position more clear.  They are migrating (generally) away from the GTK library and onto the QT library, and it is their intent for this to span from Ubuntu Touch to the desktop.\nSee Why is Canonical choosing QT over GTK for Unity's next generation? for the trail to a complete answer.\n", "Q: Ubuntu suspend works only once through lid close My system is ASUS N56VJ.

I used to have an Ubuntu installed on a Dell laptop with the same Ubuntu edition - 12.04 and the same downloading sources, but the downloading speed is quite good. Why the apt-speeds are so different? May be the Wifi driver is not suitable for this HP laptop?\n\n\n*\n\n*replies:\nThanks for all your answers;-), it's my first time to know and use this website, I didn't expect to get so many responses so soon. \n\n\nI'll try this apt-fast when I get home today, to see if it will work good enough.\nFor Alvar's questions of my network card model, I don't have knowledge of this part, but it's a HP ProBook 4431s, and from HP's website, it says it's Atheros 802.11b/g/n WiFi. And for laptop model, what's this?\nSince the old Dell loptop is not at my hand by now, the one thing I remember is that on Dell PC, when I installed it with ubuntu 12.04.1 it don't have wireless card's driver so I installed one latter using some methods I found on the Internet. But for this HP PC, the ubuntu 12.04.1 has direct support of its' wireless card, so I don't need to install a driver manually. I still think the problem might have something to do with the driver. \n\nA: you have alternative to apt-get of Ubuntu and that is apt-fast.you can install it in your PC and you can use it as you use apt-get.\nTo install apt-fast :\nopen your terminal with CTRL+ALT+T and type\nsudo apt-get install axel\n\nThen do this in the terminal itself \nwget http://www.mattparnell.com/linux/apt-fast/apt-fast.sh\nsudo -i\ncd /usr/bin\nsudo mv apt-fast.sh apt-fast\nchmod +x apt-fast\n\nThat's it you are done , now you can use it.\nfor example to update :\nsudo apt-fast update\n\nHow does apt-fast work?\n\napt-fast is a shellscript wrapper for apt-get and aptitude that can\n  drastically improve apt download times by downloading packages in\n  parallel, with multiple connections per package.\n\nQuote from github.\n", "Q: Ubuntu for Iconia W700-6607? Is there any Ubuntu for Iconia W700-6607?\nI've found some articles for w500, but not sure if it works too.\nDoes someone have the how-to? How to root, install & all?\nSpecifications: \n\nThanks.\n\nA: Normally the tutorial for the W500 should work fine, but  why do you need a tutorial for that? Isn't it a normal x86 or x64 architecture?\nShould boot fine from USB, as Ubuntu is abled to boot in UEFI mode. Take care of the touchscreen drivers and have mouse+keyboard ready during and after installation(maybe you need a USB splitter, if only one port)\n\nA: You need to enter a supervisor password in order to disable secure boot. You want to use UEFI boot if you have Windows 8 installed still and you're just trying out Ubuntu to see if it works (which it doesn't). Once you boot up Ubuntu, you'll find it doesn't work so I would save your time.\n\nA: I am typing this under Ubuntu12.04LTS on my Acer Iconia W700 double boot. \nYou need: a USB hub, USB CD/DVD-RW, USB HD, and a USB keyboard and mouse. \nThe procedure:\n\n\n*\n\n*Under Windows, download Macrium Reflect (MR), MiniTool Partition Wizard 8.1.1 (MT) and the Linux installation disk image. Burn a Linux installation CD or DVD and a Macrium Reflect recovery CD. With MR, make an image of the hard disk, just in case.\n\n*Split the Windows partition using MT. I made 16Gb available for Linux.\n\n*Change to Legacy BIOS and run the normal Ubuntu installation from a CD on a USB DVD-ROM. It helps to have a USB mouse and keyboard connected. At the partitioning stage, delete the partition created by MT, then add the Linux partitions. In my case, these were BIOS (100Mb), swap (4Gb) and root (the rest).  \n\n*My machine now boots W8 in UEFI mode and Ubuntu in Legacy mode. Important: in Legacy mode, put the disk on top of available devices. The BIOS makes a shitty job of finding bootable media. The good news is that BIOS recognises the touchscreen (I doubt GRUB would). \n\n*My Hama Bluetooth mouse paired to Ubuntu and is automatically recognised by both OSs. \n\n*I had problems pairing the native Iconia keyboard. It was found, PIN generated but pairing failed. The solution was to install and use blueman as BT manager. Use the \"Do not pair\" option. Unfortunately you have to reconnect the keyboard each time you change OS. \n\n\nThe bottom line is, use stylus to change the OS, the mouse is hooked automatically, and connecting the keyboard with the mouse present is a breeze. \n", "Q: Loud fans - Dell studio 1558 I'm having a problem with my dell studio 1558 were my fans are running very loud.\nI never had this problem on windows 7 and I'm really struggling to find a fix for it.\nI've tried other distro's as well and they have the exact same problem.\nIt doesn't seem to be cpu as nothing is using a lot of resources, I've tried installing ati drivers but then i keep running into other problems and the noise doesn't seem to go away.\nThanks for the help, much appreciated!\n\nA: I had fan problems myself on Lenovo Y580 Intel® Core™ i7-3630QM CPU with internal hd 4000 graphic, and nvidia gtx660 graphic card.\nI simply changed GPU on Nvidia X server settings (proprietary driver) to Intel.\nYou can use Intel graphic installer , it works well on Ubuntu 14.04.\n", "Q: How often will there be updates to the different developer phone images?

Cant see any partition using Gparted, though everything works? Yesterday I was trying to install Mageia Linux along with Windows 7 and Ubuntu 12.10. After several tries I finally installed Mageia and created an entry for the Mageia boot-loader in the Windows boot manager.\nThe problem is, though everything seems to be working perfectly, when I open Gparted it says that there are no partitions on the hard disk.\nHere's a screen-shot:\n\nWhat is wrong, and how can I fix this without losing any data?\n\nA: Run the same Mageia OS installation disk and again start installing Mageia, but this time uncheck all ntfs/ext4 partitions from changing labels/auto mount in Mageia. If you have changed primary partitions into logical partitions then, delete/create new partitions from the previous ones and choose \"force as primary\" and then continue the installation.\nMake it a minimal installation as you are going to remove it. Wait for the installation to complete successfully. After completion, boot into Ubuntu or run Ubuntu live DVD. Using Gparted from there reformat the Mageia partitions. Don't change anything except formatting. After formatting completes delete those partitions. Now from the free space you can again be able to create primary partitions. \nThis will fix this error. But there will be consequences\n\n\nA: why do you need two linux systems anyhow? if you just want to try it, unplug your hard drive, plug another one in, instal it and try it, if you like it better, reinstall it back on the other one again, delete the Ubuntu partitions, leave windows on there if you have it there, format partioms for ubuntu or delete them and create new ones for Mageia, format them all and then install Mageia 1,2,3 or 4 and it will automatically see window, I've been doing all this since 2003 and I have 5 differnt harddrives for my laptop with 5 different Linx sysems on each of them, it don't take long to switch a haerddrive on a laptop, or a usb flashdrive which is just as giood or better!!\nPegasus\n", "Q: Python runs way faster while the machine is shutting down? This morning when I was shutting my machine down from an overnight test of running openCV to display a data stream from one of my cameras, I noticed that my frame rates nearly doubled in the video window.\nThis happens for about 3-5 seconds just before the os goes blank, but there is a very noticeable difference in video Fps (or processing with python..). \nWhile the machine was shutting down i was wondering what might be some of these larg processes that are closing, and how much i even really need them during python runtime.\nnow im trying to figure out what some of these processes are which are not mission critical to running python or opencv and shut them down. \nI was wondering however what you guys would recommend, up to now I felt that the frame rate i was getting was limited by the hardware.

Awesome is really minimalistic and the default setup is... well... minimal. All the settings and configs are in ~/.config/awesome/ the main one being rc.lua.\nHowever for testing purposes you shouldn't care. Simply press Super-Enter to spawn a terminal and run your process from there. The Super key is the Windows key, we just try really hard to avoid that word.\nRunning a different DE is a lazy \"solution\" to your problem. \nIf it doesn't help you will have to look at all the running processes and make guesses to which one creates the bottleneck. run htop or top to get a nice overview.\nrun ps -aux | grep python to get a list of all python processes.\n", "Q: Ubuntu server12.04 not connecting to other LAN (via site-to-site VPN) dear community members: \nI have a fresh install of Ubuntu 12.04 server (x64), and planned using it as a web server within a local network, which has 3 physical locations connected via site-to-site VPN.

Still not helping. please help me to direct what to do?  thank you!!\n\nA: The ping to google is using the default routing and does only show that your internet connection seems to work ;-)\nFor other local LAN networks you have two possibilities.\ndifferent logical LAN on the same physical hardware\nIf you use different logical LAN on the same physical hardware (e.g. for security reasons), you have to ensure that the used netmask on the interface covers all used LAN addresses.\nrouting between really different LAN\nFor this you should know which server is connected to the other (e.g. 192.186.11.*) network and your network.\nFor this purpose you can use the ip (or the old fashioned route) command.\nFor a permanent solution you have to tweak ether your dhcp server or local network configuration (/etc/network/interfaces).\n", "Q: do-release-upgrade or apt-get dist-upgrade to go from a 12.04.1 to 12.04.2? I used to make an \napt-get dist-upgrade\n\nto upgrade my system from 12.04.X to 12.04.X+1, but now I have doubts if\ndo-release-upgrade\n\nis better or even if that command classified as an option to such minor upgrades. In the do-release-upgrade man page one can read \n\nUpgrade the operating system to the latest release\n\nbut is not clear to me if that mean latest minor version or latest major version, because latest major version could be seem even like another OS and not a version of the same OS.\n\nA: Point releases are not new releases, from the prospective of APT. Therefore, do-release-upgrade would do the wrong thing and upgrade to 12.10.\nIn fact, do-release-upgrade checks changelogs.ubuntu.com/meta-release which contains just 12.04.2, while there are no traces of 12.04 and 12.04.1. Also, 12.04.2 uses the same archive and upgrade tools of 12.04.1 and 12.04.\nPoint releases are just used to plan development:\n\nCompatible with New Hardware: We will make point releases throughout the development cycle to provide functional support for new server and desktop hardware.\n\n", "Q: Ubuntu 12.10 slowing down other devices on my network I'm very much a Linux noob, so this is probably something that's easy to fix or find out. \nEver since I installed Ubuntu, my internet speed seems to be good for my Ubuntu PC, but nothing else. Once I turn my PC off, or put it to sleep mood, the devices that were slow speed back up again.\nThis problem happens to my Nexus 7 and my PlayStation 3, so it's not a problem with an operating system, it's to do with the network and maybe Ubuntu in some way.\nAny help would be appreciated, though I'm not that well known with Linux.\n\nA: Two possible issues:\n\n\n*\n\n*Ubuntu is downloading stuff. This could be background updates, something in Transmission (torrent), or a download in your browser.\n\n*Your network card is slower. Wireless networking is only as good as the least-capable node attached to it. This means if your PS3 and Nexus 7 are using 802.11n, and your computer uses 802.11g, then everything else is going to slow down to the 802.11g speeds and bandwidth (same goes for 802.11g vs 802.11b). Make sure your computer uses the same technology as at least one of the other two (the PS3 originally shipped with 802.11g, I don't know if they upgraded it; the Nexus should be 802.11n). If it's not, then upgrade it. \n\n\n*\n\n*Alternatively, if your router supports dual-band output, you can split your wireless in to 5GHz and 2.4GHz. Put anything that supports it onto the 5GHz connection, and everything else on the 2.4GHz connection. That can help keep your slower nodes from slowing down the more capable one, though chances are the PS3 will still be stuck on the slower connection.\n\n\n", "Q: I have Ubuntu 12.04LTS installed, how do I upgrade to 12.10 using a DVD? I am running Ubuntu 12.04LTS as the sole operating system and would like to upgrade to 12.10.  I have burned the ISO image to a DVD.  How do I go about upgrading via WiFi or using the DVD?\n\nA: If you're okay upgrading over the internet via WiFi then you should be able to just go to the software updater and upgrade! If you cannot see an upgrade option you may need to go into settings and change \"Notify me of a new Ubuntu version\" to \"For any new version\".\nTo upgrading using a DVD, just boot into the DVD and there should be an option to upgrade the current installation.\nBefore you upgrade you may want to check that your hardware can run Unity 3D as Unity 2D isn't included in 12.10 and you will be forced to use Unity 3D which would run unbearably slowly! Plus, you would probably want to back up all your data just in case anything goes wrong!\n\nA: Since you have already burned iso into DVD use DVD itself. It is the better way to upgrade from DVD. But you have to make sure that you have created bootable DVD. And don't forget to have a backup of all your data(documents).\n", "Q: problems with win 8 I have a HP compaq CQ58, with Win 8 preinstalled.

I'm using Ubuntu 12.10 and for my side bar Home Folder launcher, I want to use different bookmarks. I have my Music, Pictures and Videos on another drive and want the default ones to link to those folders on the other drive instead. How can I set which folders I want to use for the Home Folder launcher button? \n\nA: You can achieve using this alternate way. You can go for folder synchronization where both folders are on the same HDD. In How to synchronize folders is a solution which shows folder synchronization between internal HDD to external HDD but you can just change the path of destination and you will achieve what you need. This is just an alternate way. I don't know how to edit the link of home folder itself.\n\nA: OK, It's simple.

You are confused because cogitoergosum assumed that you understand how the command line works. You will need to open a command prompt, and you will need to learn how to use several commands. The only way to truly solve this problem requires working on the command line interface (CLI). CLI skills are extremely valuable, especially in professional computing; so I will help you get started.\nFirst, type man cd and press enter. To escape the manual pages, when you are done reading and want to try out the command cd, type q. On Linux, unlike Windows, man + [command] will bring up the manual pages for any command you desire (just replace the + [command] with your desired command. For example, type man vi to learn how to edit files with vi.\ncd /etc/X11/ will take you to the directory containing \"xorg.conf\". You need to be careful to fix changes to the ownership and permissions of the files when they are edited as the root user.See the man pages for chmod and chown (type man chmod or man chown). You will always want to backup your files before changing them. To backup files, there are a few techniques. You can use cat to output a file's contents and then redirect the output to a new file. Eg. cat /etc/X11/xorg.conf > /etc/X11/xorg.conf.bkp1. You can also use cp or mv, but I usually just use redirection.  To see a given directory contents, try ls or ls -l. If you can't see all the output, pipe the output into less by typing ls -l | less. \nI found the solution to Nvidia bugs on Linux here for 64 bit: Nvidia & Linux x64 - common problems and solutions Readme - \nHere's the same readme for 32 bit (x86): Nvidia & Linux x86 - common problems and solutions Readme - 256.44\nIf you are using different Nvidia drivers for Linux, then you can find similar readme files on the Nvidia site here: Linux Display Driver Archive.\nIf you really want to increase your skills, you should Google the linux documents on shell scripting.\n\nA: Just for all the others having this problem. Turning off dithering in nvidia settings appeared to have reduce the effect but it wasn't totally gone.\nBut turning off Flipping helped. I don't have this nasty flickering anymore.

I had it on 14.04 and I just recently upgraded that box from Linux Mint 18, where the problem also existed. I'm now running 16.04.2. The compizconfig-settings-manager change to force redraws did not work for me, but it got me playing around with the other settings. What fixed it for me was unchecking the \"Force complete redraw on initial damage\" option.\nI don't know if I have a hardware issue that is causing a bit to be flipped which Compiz thinks is damage, but I haven't seen any artifacting or damage and the screen flicker is gone. I'm using the Intel embedded graphics in my Pentium G870 over HDMI to a 1080p TV.\n\nA: Im using Linux Mint 17 with same issues plagued for some time.

Any idea?\nNote that what is on \n\n/etc/apache2/conf.d/other-vhosts-access-log\n\nis not a default option but a global option.\n\nA: For Ubuntu 16.04, you can find the global configuration file here:\n/etc/apache2/apache2.conf\n\nTherein it defines some LogFormat directives.\nLogFormat \"%v:%p %h %l %u %t \\\"%r\\\" %>s %O \\\"%{Referer}i\\\" \\\"%{User-Agent}i\\\"\" vhost_combined\nLogFormat \"%h %l %u %t \\\"%r\\\" %>s %O \\\"%{Referer}i\\\" \\\"%{User-Agent}i\\\"\" combined\nLogFormat \"%h %l %u %t \\\"%r\\\" %>s %O\" common\nLogFormat \"%{Referer}i -> %U\" referer\nLogFormat \"%{User-agent}i\" agent\n\nThe out-of-the-box virtual host configuration file is here:\n/etc/apache2/sites-available/000-default.conf\n\nAnd inside you will find that it declares:\nCustomLog ${APACHE_LOG_DIR}/access.log combined\n\nThe combined alias refers to the second LogFormat in the aforementioned global config:\n\"%h %l %u %t \\\"%r\\\" %>s %O \\\"%{Referer}i\\\" \\\"%{User-Agent}i\\\"\"\n\n\nA: It is clearly stated in the documetation for the TransferLog statement:\n\nThis directive has exactly the same arguments and effect as the CustomLog directive, with the exception that it does not allow the log format to be specified explicitly or for conditional logging of requests. Instead, the log format is determined by the most recently specified LogFormat directive which does not define a nickname. Common Log Format is used if no other format has been specified.\n\nGo on to the LogFormat statement:\n\nDefault:  LogFormat \"%h %l %u %t \\\"%r\\\" %>s %b\"\n\nSo if a TransferLog statement is given without any LogFormat statement the output format is as described above.\nIf also the TransferLog statment is missing no access log is written.\n\nA: Default LogFormat is indeed really\nDefault: LogFormat \"%h %l %u %t \\\"%r\\\" %>s %b\"\n\nBut the log format apache uses by default (on Debian distro at least) is:\nLogFormat \"%h %l %u %t \\\"%r\\\" %>s %b \\\"%{Referer}i\\\" \\\"%{User-Agent}i\\\"\"\n\n", "Q: Print a helpful error message when printing quota is reached I'm attempting to set up print quotas for printers here at the office. \nHowever, it appears when the quota is reached, the print just fails silently, and the user doesn't have any idea what's happening.\nThe page quota's been set up by altering the PageLimit directive in /etc/cups/printers.conf\nIt appears I'm getting the message\nE [04/Mar/2013:15:34:28 -0700] Returning IPP client-error-not-possible for Create-Job\n(ipp://localhost:631/printers/Hewlett-Packard-HP-LaserJet-4100-MFP) from localhost\n\nin my log at /var/log/cups/error_log. \nI tried hacking something together via a command like \ntail -f /var/log/cups/error_log | grep 'client-error-not-possible for Create-Job' | DISPLAY=:0 notify-send -t 30000 -i 'notification-message-email' 'Printing Quota reached for this Printer'\n\nBut that doesn't seem to really work as it only displays the message once on the first error message. \nAny thoughts or solutions? It really seems like there should be a prebaked solution for this.\n\nA: Answered here on Super User by Semafoor:\n\nI would look into using incrontab for monitoring changes to the\n  file system, and combine that with the little script you already have.\nThis looks approximately as follows.   First, save the script that you\n  want to execute as a file, e.g. as cups_monitor.sh in\n  /usr/local/bin (don't forget to make it executable).\n#!/bin/sh\nVAR=`tail -n 1 /var/log/cups/error_log | grep 'client-error-not-possible for Create-Job'`\nif [[ -n \"$VAR\" ]]; then\n   echo \"$VAR\" | DISPLAY=:0 notify-send -t 30000 -i\nfi\n\nYou might want to check this. My scripts are never right first try :).\n  Also note that it is possible that this script does not capture your\n  error message if it is followed by other message: I only look at the\n  last line of the log file (-n 1); this should be easy to change.\nThen edit your incrontab\nincrontab -e\n\nby adding the line\n/var/log/cups/error_log IN_CLOSE_WRITE /usr/local/bin/cups_monitor.sh\n\nThe IN_CLOSE_WRITE is called an 'event symbol' and indicates that\n  you want to want to call your script when/var/log/cups/error_log was\n  closed after it was opened for writing; you can find other events in\n  the man page of incrontab.\nKeep in mind that I did not test this. You can see whether the\n  incrontab file was changed successfully and whether it calls your\n  script or not by looking in the syslog (tail /var/log/syslog).\n\n", "Q: How to enable higher CPU frequency on Lubuntu 12.04?

Let's call them A and B.\nA can SSH to B in the following manner: ssh usr@<internal ip of computer>\nB can SSH to A by doing the same, but the external IP must be used. I have forwarded port 22 of my router to the IP of computer A, so that all makes sense to me.\nHowever, I want to also forward port 26 to computer B, and SSH from outside the network by using the external IP for both, but specifying either port 22 or 26, to effectively select which computer to use.\nI have tried allowing port 26 through OUTPUT of iptables on A and INPUT of B, but that didn't seem to work. I have also forwarded port 26 to the internal IP of B (through the router), as I did with 22 for A.\nHere's what I get when I try to SSH from A to B using the external IP and port 26:\nssh: connect to host xx.xx.xxx.xx port 26: Connection refused.\n\nVersions:\n\n\n*\n\n*A = OpenSSH_5.9p1 Debian-5ubuntu1, OpenSSL 1.0.1 14 Mar 2012\n\n*B = OpenSSH_6.0p1 Debian-4, OpenSSL 1.0.1c 10 May 2012\n\n\nA has 12.04 Ubuntu, B is a Raspberry Pi with Raspbian.\nEDIT: Something that I forgot to put in: I did try switching the SSH config file (I found it is /etc/ssh/ssh_config) I uncommented (deleted the #) the line with Port and changed 22 to 26. It gave me the connection refused message still. (I rebooted to no avail.)\n\nA: It seems like you're not running SSH on port 26 on the second machine. You can either change the port number on that machine to 26.\nEither edit /etc/ssh/sshd_config & don't forget to restart SSH (service sshd restart) or leave it on 22, but forward port 26 on the router to port 22 on the second machine. Also, don't forget to change any firewall settings on the second machine  to allow the connections through.\n\nA: If you are on Linux system and you want connect to an SSH server on port 26 you can use the following command.\nssh user@192.168.1.1 -p 26\n\nNote:\n\n\n*\n\n*Replace server IP with the IP Address or DNS name of your server.\n\n*Change your port number as you have set.\n\n*if you are using custom port SSH then same port most be allowed for outbound, inbound connection on firewall otherwise the connection will not establish\n\n\nA: It is not a good idea to run ssh on default port (TCP/22), neither forward from WAN IP 22 to whatever port is using ssh-server on LAN IP.\nTo make ssh-server listen on any given port you have to\n\n*\n\n*Edit on /etc/ssh/sshd_config (note the d) from #Port 22 to Port 26. Ie, uncomment and change the port. Better than 26 would be something randomly above (below 65535), like 42895.\nAlso consider changing to PermitRootLogin no.\n\n\n*Test your configuration with ssh test mode\nsudo sshd -t\n\n\n\n*Restart ssh-server service\n sudo systemctl restart sshd.service\n\nThen from ssh-client you will be able to connect\nssh user@serverNameOrIP -p 42895\n\nBonus: mosh\n\nMosh (mobile shell) Remote terminal application that allows roaming, supports intermittent connectivity, and provides intelligent local echo and line editing of user keystrokes.. Mosh is a replacement for interactive SSH terminals. It's more robust and responsive, especially over Wi-Fi, cellular, and long-distance links.\n\nIf mosh package is installed on server you can then use\nmosh --ssh=\"ssh -p 42895\" serverNameOrIP\n\n\nA: I use port 22 only for the intranet ssh access.\nFor access via internet I use a custom (unusual) port.\nThis has the benefit the I reduce the load produced generated by script kids who are scanning port 22 for \"well known usernames\".\nThe external sshd processes are controlled by xinetd and running in parallel to the internal sshd process.\nIn the following example I use the port 12345:\nYou are free to change this to any available free port number on your system.\nMaybe a higher value will make it also a bit more unlikely that this port is scanned by a \"quick port scan\". \nThe xinetd configuration is:\nservice ssh-external\n{\n    socket_type = stream\n    wait = no\n    protocol = tcp\n    type = UNLISTED\n    user = root\n    server = /usr/sbin/sshd\n    server_args = -i -f  /etc/ssh/external-sshd.config\n    port = 12345\n    log_on_failure += USERID\n}\n\nThe file /etc/ssh/external-ssdh.config can be a copy of your usual sshd configuration.\nEnsure that the following statements are configured:\nPort 12345\nAddressFamily inet\n\nI also suggest to enforce public key authentication and disable password authentication for the internet access:\nPasswordAuthentication no\nPermitEmptyPasswords no\nChallengeResponseAuthentication no\n\n\nA: As I've explained in a related answer, ssh client allows specifying URI format as ssh://user@host:1234. For example:\nssh  ssh://myuser@mydomain.com:2222\n\nwhere 2222 is the port number. Substitute the port number which you intend to use instead. Of course, remember that in order to connect to the specified port ssh server (on the host to which you are trying to connect) has to listen on the specified port in the first place\n\nA: Listen ports also can be hard linked to IP addresses\n/etc/ssh/sshd_config:\nListenAddress 10.10.10.10:22\nListenAddress 20.20.20.20:4444\n\n\nA: Two approaches.\nYou don't need to make any changes to your SSH configuration on either machine. If you set up port-forwarding on your router you can forward traffic from any public port on the router to port 22 on the computer. Use a different port forwarded to port 22 on the other machine. Unless you have a good reason to do it you should avoid opening port 22 on your external IP address. It makes you a target.\nThe other option is simply to SSH into one of the machines then SSH from there to the other.\n", "Q: how to install c++ fastcgi development library?

I have also come to understand that this can be easily fixed with some terminal commands via the liveUSB. Please correct me if I'm wrong.\n\nA: The message indicates that your are running low of memory.\nThe current need is only satisfied with enabled swap space.\nMost likely is that you loaded the LiveUSB content into ram at boot time.\nCheck the boot menu and deselect this option.\nSome further remarks\nAs I see in your question, the swap space is not inside the partition you want to resize. So with a little bit luck you haven't the need to disable the swap space. Give it a try.\nGenerally I would consider to use LVM instead of bare partitions.\nThe \"space management\" is a lot easier and you can do it online without LiveUSB :-) \nYou can increase a partition if you have enough free space allocated for the LVM volume group.\nIf you run low of space in a volume group you can simply add a new physical volume to the volume group.

I was looking through APT packages for Quantal and I found one called linux-signed-image-generic, which only says that it's \"Signed with the Ubuntu EFI key.\" The kernel package that it currently depends on says pretty much the same thing.\nSo if your hardware supports EFI (I think I'm running the signed kernel now) then what benefits does the signed kernel have? Is it just a security thing?\n\nA: It is a security thing but there is no performance benefit for your system.\nNew hardware will have secure boot. The problem is, that this hardware won't boot an OS that is not signed. The hardware is checking the software at startup to see if it is signed. If it isn't, the hardware will prevent the software from booting.\nThis is a security thing, because in theory it will prevent e.g. malware to start on your hardware.\nThere was a lot of discussion about this feature because an open source OS must get signed to run on future computers and that must be paid. And this is not the Open Source way.\nThis is a short explanation, but there is a lot of stuff on the web about it.\n", "Q: Allocating more disk space to Ubuntu I used the windows installer to install Ubuntu 12.04 on my PC.

Ok now move your mouse over to the windows partition and resize it. No biggie eh? You now have more Linux room.

Although you are limited to 6 regular keys you are still guaranteed that any combination of keys will be recognized properly if you have an n-key rollover keyboard. I would guess that most people would not need support for more keys than this. I would also guess that the 6 key limit may have had something to do with braille input requirements rather than someone choosing an arbitrary limit (although that doesn't explain why the limit exists in the first place).\n    PS/2 - There are no limitations when using a PS/2 connection with your keyboard. You will truly get full n-key rollover support.\nSo using 2 standard keyboards without without PS/2, I think that you could have a maximum of 8 modifier keys.\n", "Q: How to produce a MSWord like document on Ubuntu 11.10?

Is there any way to change the UTC offset for the graphs generated by bandwidthd?\n\nA: The source code does use and store timestamps, that are then provided to the C functions ctime() and localtime() in order to display the date at the top of the page, and at the bottom of the graphs.\nThese Unix timestamps are time-zone-less, the number of seconds since 1970-01-01.\nTo get a human readable time, ctime() and localtime() automatically adjust the time zone to be used according to your system time zone (via a call to tzset()).\nForcing the TZ the time of a command\nYou can force anyway the time zone to a given value just for the time of a command execution, or during a whole daemon session, like bandwidthd. The environment variable TZ is read by tzset() to adjust the timezone, if set.\nFirst have a look at the time zone definitions in /usr/share/zoneinfo\nThen for instance, cd to your home dir in a terminal, and do a simple ls -lrt to see the most recent files at the bottom of the list. Then set the timezone to Paris, France, for instance\nexport TZ=\"Europe/Paris\"\n\nand do another ls -lrt, the time should be different (if you happen to have a system configured with a timezone set to France you may want to choose another TZ!).\nNow unset the TZ var, just to prevent some mistakes based on time displayed in the terminal.\nunset TZ\n\n\nChanging the TZ of bandwidthd\nI assume you installed the bandwidthd package from Ubuntu apt-get, and you should have an init file for it to start as a service. Do a copy somewhere of the file and then edit it as root (vi or another editor)\nsudo cp -p /etc/init.d/bandwidthd ~/bandwidthd.save\nsudo vi /etc/init.d/bandwidthd\n\nNear the top you see a few variables definitions\nNAME=bandwidthd\nDESC=BandwidthD\n...\n\nadd one (eg, for Paris)\nMYTZ=\"Europe/Paris\"\n\nthen, further below in the startd() function, you should see\n    cd $WORKDIR && start-stop-daemon --start --quiet \\\n            --pidfile $PIDFILE \\\n            --chdir $WORKDIR \\\n            --exec $DAEMON -- $DAEMON_OPTS\n\nchange it to\n    cd $WORKDIR && start-stop-daemon --start --quiet \\\n            --pidfile $PIDFILE \\\n            --chdir $WORKDIR \\\n            --exec /usr/bin/env TZ=\"$MYTZ\" $DAEMON -- $DAEMON_OPTS\n\n(notice the /usr/bin/env TZ=\"$MYTZ\" between --exec and $DAEMON).\n\nRestart the process\nsudo service bandwidthd restart\n\nand, could take a few seconds, the files should be updated, in a browser open file:///var/lib/bandwidthd/htdocs/index.html (or the dir where the files are written) to check.\n", "Q: How to enable Empathy incoming message notifications?

Every time I've tried to use Unity, I get stuck with the problem of there not being any standard lists of programs—there’s no menu for things like “system tools”, there’s no way to find the terminal without TYPING “terminal”.  And yes, I’m sure some of you are laughing because someone couldn't remember the word “terminal”, but I just couldn't remember at one point—I could remember “shell” or “bash” but I couldn't remember “terminal” and was scratching my head (eventually I found it with a web search).  This of course applies to just about any program, and you have to admit, some programs are named VERY strange things that sometimes have nothing to do with what the program actually does.\nWith Unity, I can’t find AND launch programs JUST using the mouse unless they’re already in the sidebar/dock/taskbar thingy, and it’s frustrating, being a person that’s really really bad with names.  I know you can find lists of things using the Software Center, but that's not for launching programs.  Why do you require people memorize the names of everything?\nAre there ANY plans on making the GUI easier for people who are bad with names?\n\nA: Well, can't speak about the future but here's a little something that will give you a list of software that your OS knows about:\nfor files in /usr/share/applications/*.desktop; do grep -e \"^Exec=\" -e \"^Name=\" $files | sed 's/Exec=/Command: /g' | sed 's/Name=/Name: /g' >> ~/Desktop/mgtl.txt ; done  \n\nSo, after running this code by copying (Ctrl+C) and pasting it (Ctrl + Alt + V) into a terminal and then pressing Enter, you'll find a file called mgtl.txt on your Desktop.

Is it possible?\nNote  I want to allow multiple user sessions at once\nThank you\n\nA: For the Ubuntu colleagues, create user accounts on your machine. Then have them login with ssh -Y and run their desired application. The -Y option allows the visual output to get tunneled to their box. \nIf you want your colleagues to have a full desktop environment, you could enable XDMCP on your box, and have them run one of the client solutions described in the Ubuntu XDMCP documentation. Note that running Unity or Gnome this way is pretty much out of the question, you could however give them a lightweight desktop environment such as XFCE.\n\nA: There is a program in Ubuntu named Desktop sharing. You can access it from dash (press super key).\nEdit: For a single user on remote Ubuntu/Linux only one user can be logged on. If you want to share your screen try tools like TeamViewer and a greate chrome extenssion from https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/chrome-remote-desktop/gbchcmhmhahfdphkhkmpfmihenigjmpp.\n", "Q: Intel i386 82865G onboard graphics I just installed Ubuntu 12.04.2 on a Gateway system. It has Intel i386 82865G onboard graphics. I've downloaded these drivers from the Intel page, they have \"Linux\" label, no specific version, the filename is \"20030425-i386.tar.gz\".\nBeing new to Ubuntu and Linux in general, I need help with how to install these drivers... thanks!\n\nA: First install Ubuntu 12.04 LTS (eg. 12.04.2), and see what drivers it already has. Then for any other device (or feature), ask on this forum.\n\nJust downloading 'generic Linux' drivers may not help very much. These at least need to be for Debian (Ubuntu is based on this) or RedHat/Fedora (the other main variant). Then you are going to have to modify and configure them to suit the environment (OS) .. \nWhat is going to work is a driver for the specific device and the specific variant of Linux (and 32/64bit, etc.).

Will the legacy drivers work with this version of the video card?\n\nA: My experience trying to install/tweak a HD7770 recently (using xubuntu 12.10):\n\n\n*\n\n*The open source drivers are okay for desktop use, can get dual screens going (but not screen rotation) with some tearing in HD video.

But dual-screen support was awful.\nApparently there is a magic script (smxi.org/sgfxi) that can fix things, but by the time I tried it my system was so broken I couldn't even get to a Ctrl-Alt-1 console to run it properly. In the end I gave up, reinstalled and bought an nVidia GPU and have found it much better.\nAs I said, just my experience. Hopefully you have better luck than me.

In my /home/myuserI have many folder like .thunderbird, .mozilla, .skype, etc. And meaningful for human folders like Downloads, Documents, become lost among folder with configs, cache, etc. \nHow to move this app-folders in specific folder?\n\nA: This is not a good idea, and those applications may stop working. And some applications work with exact path to your home folder. Usually application specific folders are hidden, so there must be no problem with human readability.\n\nA: Change your point of view.\n/home/user is a technical directory for the specific user.\nIt contains the application configuration and data files for this user in some directories,\ne.g. .thunderbird, ... , .config, .local, ...\nThese configuration and data files are generally not portable to other machines or users.\n(If it is possible to reuse the configuration, your are in the \"special case justifing the general case ;-)\").\nFor example:\n\n\n*\n\n*host names and other resources are only valid for this installation\n\n*absolute paths are hard coding the user name\n\n\nPortable data like office documents, source code and multimedia data goes to different directories.\nSo I would move this kind of data out of the user home directory.

I like to have my devices mounted in Nautilus/Nemo by default when I log in, so I can have symlinks to certain directories. \nAnd I don't mean a custom mount or a mount with 10 lines of cryptSetup and luksOpen commands that would require me to hardcode a LUKS password. Not only because, but also because it is not compatible with the devices list in Nautilus/Nemo.\n\nTo do this, I can have an autostart script (Startup Applications) using gvfs-mount -d like so, very easy to maintain and it will automatically get LUKS-passwords from the keyring if necessary:\n#!/usr/bin/env bash\n\n# Redsandro 2013-03-01\n# Mount (LUKS) drives and such\n\ndoMount() {\n    # Devices change every now and then.

Browse to org -> gnome -> desktop - media-handling.\nUncheck automount-open.\n\n*In Terminal\ngsettings set org.gnome.desktop.media-handling automount-open false\nThere should be a similar option for Nemo since it is a fork of Nautilus. \nNote that this will prevent Nautilus to open windows for any new mounted device (including USB keys). \nThere is no simple mean I'm aware of to selectively open windows for some devices and not for others (eg. there are means, but not simple; they require scripting and technical knowledge).\n\nA: This is wrong! You need to edit /etc/fstab. this is a sample :\n/dev/sda1   /   ext2    defaults    1 1\n/dev/sda2   /home/mostafa/musics    ext2    defaults    1 2\n\nIn the above, device /dev/sda2 is mounted to /home/mostafa/Musics\n", "Q: Why do people say 'make install' is bad? I keep seeing people saying make; make install is bad. I can't seem to find anyone with a reasonable explanation.\nSo, why is it bad? Or why do people tend to say \"It's bad, use clear install instead\" or similar?\n\nA: ./configure; make; make install is bad because it is difficult to undo unless:\n\n\n*\n\n*the developer provided an uninstall target, or \n\n*you provided a prefix to configure, so all the installed files are tucked away in a neat corner of the filesystem. \n\n\nOne should use checkinstall instead. Install it:\nsudo apt-get install checkinstall\n\nAnd then use checkinstall instead of make install:\n./configure\nmake\ncheckinstall\n\n(With appropriate usage of sudo.) And then you can use the package system to remove it:\nsudo dpkg -r <name-of-package>\n\n\nA: You need make and make install to compile a software.\nFor the daily use it is better to run apt-get install to install a pre-compiles package. It's easier to use and ist easier to uninstall or check the version, etc. I think this is what people mean with \"clear install\", but I'm not sure.\nBut sometimes you need to install a software and there is no pre-compiled package in the repository or a installer for the package. In this case you will have to use configure, make and make install. \nThis is why I wouldn't say \"it's bad\". It is not the best way to install for dayly use, but sometimes it is just necessary.\n\nA: It is not bad by any stretch of imagination if your goal is to build software from sources. Some cases when this is necessary are:\n\n\n*\n\n*you are a developer that builds software\n\n*you want to test some software that is not available as an ubuntu package or a new version of software that is not available yet\nHowever, outside of these cases, it is recommended to use apt-get install (or dpkg -i), because chances are that this way you will get a more stable, tested version of the software that you want to install.\nBuilding from source also has the risk that you might mess up your ubuntu system if you do not really understand well the piece of software that you are making.\n", "Q: What are some audio/video converters for Linux? What are some audio/video converters for Linux?\n\nA: A best video/audio converter of choice is WINFF (GUI of ffmpeg is here )\n\nA: I'm focusing on video converters here, although FFmpeg or mencoder can encode audio as well.\nGraphical interface\nHandbrake\nFrom its homepage:\nHandBrake is an open-source, GPL-licensed, multiplatform, multithreaded video transcoder.\nEasy to use GUI with presets for various hardware devices; can rip DVDs with ease.\nAvidemux\nFrom its homepage:\nAvidemux is a free video editor designed for simple cutting, filtering, and encoding tasks. It supports many file types, including AVI, DVD compatible MPEG files, MP4 and ASF, using a variety of codecs. Tasks can be automated using projects, job queue and powerful scripting capabilities.\nAlso rather easy to use. It is somewhat comparable to VirtualDub on Windows.\nVLC\nVLC provides and easily accessible converting function in Media->Convert/Save. An instruction is given here.\nCommand line interface\nFFmpeg (or its fork avconv) ###\nFrom its homepage:\nFFmpeg is a complete, cross-platform solution to record, convert and stream audio and video. It includes libavcodec - the leading audio/video codec library.\nExample:\nffmpeg -i input.mkv -c:v mjpeg -b 2000k -c:a libmp3lame -ab 128k -ar 44100 -vf denoise3d,scale=640:360 output.avi\n\nMencoder\nmencoder is part of the MPlayer project, so it shares the same syntax.\nExample:\nmencoder input.wmv -ovc lavc -lavcopts vcodec=mpeg4:vbitrate=3000 -oac mp3lame -lameopts cbr:br=160 -vf denoise3d,scale=640:360 -o output.avi \n\nHandbrake\nHandbrake also has a command line interface.\nCodec restrictions due to software patents\nBe aware that due to software patents, some programs in the standard Ubuntu repositories don't include certain codecs (H264 encoding is a prominent example).\nWorkarounds for stripped down binaries:\nEnable the Medibuntu repositories:\nsudo -E wget --output-document=/etc/apt/sources.list.d/medibuntu.list http://www.medibuntu.org/sources.list.d/$(lsb_release -cs).list && sudo apt-get --quiet update && sudo apt-get --yes --quiet --allow-unauthenticated install medibuntu-keyring && sudo apt-get --quiet update\nsudo apt-get dist-upgrade\n\nUse a prebuilt static binary\nFor example, you can download FFmpeg with all codecs supported here: http://ffmpeg.gusari.org/static/\nIf you want to run that binary, don't forget to call it with the full path; otherwise, the FFmpeg of Ubuntu will be run.\nBuild the binaries for yourself...\n...and include everything you want. This is, of course, the most tedious solution.\n\nA: That depends on what you mean by Best. There are a lot of them out there. ffmpeg (avconv) is my favourite one.

Do you know how to prevent or override this behavior?\n\nA: It took a while to figure out, but I have an answer for this.  This actually happens on all Ubuntu versions that I checked and I'm using this fix on 12.04 right now.\nI have found that these mappings are not reset if you have all of your xmodmap mappings in a file that is called ~/.Xmodmap.\nI had called my file .xmodmaprc and had exactly the behavior that you experience.  After changing to the new file name, this annoying behavior went away.  My guess is that Ubuntu reads mappings from this file whenever there is a new keyboard added to the system.\n\nA: I'm not sure if this is a bug or a \"feature\" which I will explain why this could be a feature later on, But here's what I experienced on my laptop:\n\n\n*\n\n*Upon connecting and disconnecting my wireless keyboard USB dongle, xmodmap resets.\n\n*But after Connecting USB dognle and applying xmodmap bindings, restarting the OS, xmodmap bindings are intact and disconnecting the dongle does not reset xmodmap.\n\n\nSo why this could be a feature? two keyboards means different layouts, so my wireless keyboard's layout is different than my laptop's keyboard of course. I do not want the same bindings I use on my laptop's keyboard on my wireless full sized keyboard, so whenever I plug in my keyboard, xmodmap resets to default.\nDo you want the same bindings on your other keyboard? feel free to do xmodmap ~/.Xmodmap in Terminal every time xmodmap resets.\nBut if you want to have different bindings, keep your bindings for your other keyboard in a new file like ~/.Xmodmap2 and each time you want to use your second keyboard, after you connect it and xmodmap resets, just do xmodmap ~/.Xmodmap2.\n", "Q: QtCreator : set device-debug to WLAN-SSH without USB I am working on/with Ubuntu-phone / Ubuntu-Touch on my Gnex in VMware.\nVMware seems to have USB-Problems so I got problems with adb/usb/ssh too.\nBut I am connected to the phone by WLAN-SSH.\nIs it possible to configure the 'device' in Creator  to WLAN-SSH without having USB-Connection to the phone?\nregards\nsUbuPack\n\nA: Yes it is possible but right now a little bit tricky. \n\n\n*\n\n*Get the IP-address of your Ubuntu Touch device.\nadb shell \nip addr show wlan0 \n\n\n*edit the file menu.json\nsudo nano /usr/share/qtcreator/ubuntu/menu.json\n\nremove there 'p2222' and change 127.0.0.1 to the IP-Address from (1.)\nRestart the QT-Creator and run your application with Ctrl + F12.\nI tried it with my N7 and it worked.\nProblems:\n\n\n*\n\n*You have to connect via USB to get your mobiles IP address.

I suggest to use also a different hard disk.\n\n*Compare backup and recovered data.\n\n*Identify recovered data which is newer as the same content in your backup and not scrambled.

This has been always a question for me, is it good or bad to leave PC suspended for a long time (a week for example)? Is it good or bad to never shut down PC and instead of it use suspend? Will there be any hardware/software problems? Will hard disk shut down during suspension? Will mother board shut down? Will there be any heat problem with CPU?\nAny kind of helps would be appreciated.\n\nA: Well, it might a good idea to restart when Ubuntu asks you too (e.g. kernel installation), but generally it should not be a problem to just use suspend-only mode of operation.\nAs for the 'for week' part – it depends – the computer will draw small amount of power (as does your telly, etc.), so if you leave it unplugged, you might found it dead after some period of time because of battery would be drained.

It's a terminal multiplexer.\n\nA: \nnohup is a POSIX command to ignore the HUP (hangup) signal. The HUP (hangup) signal is by convention the way a terminal warns depending processes of logout.\n  Output that would normally go to the terminal goes to a file called nohup.out if it has not already been redirected.\n  nohup is a low-level utility simply configuring a command to ignore a signal. As seen below, nohup is very far from being a full-featured batch system solving all the problems of running programs asynchronously.\n\nSee manual:\nman nohup\n\nExample:\nnohup cairo-dock &\n\n\nA: Yet another way: disown\nIn the bash shell, the disown builtin command is used to remove jobs from the job table, or to mark jobs so that a SIGHUP signal is not sent to them if the parent shell receives it (e.g. if the user logs out).\nFor example:\ncairo-dock & disown\n\n", "Q: Changing Vim editor settings?

It's annoying to have to do setxkbmap -layout \"jp,ru\" -option \"grp:alt_shift_toggle\" every time the Russian layout stops working.\n\nA: Ubuntu intermittently checks if there are X settings and removes them to prevent conflicts with dbus's window manager configuration.\nInstead of using X settings you should configure the keyboard using dbus.\n\nA: This worked for me: I noticed Fcitx (https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/fcitx) was being run on the start.

Turned windows on, installed mobo drivers, worked perfectly? Detected all cards first try.......\nThat only thing I think fixed my problem was just moving the cards, and turn the computer on and off until it recognized them all. Other than that, that is the only fix.\n\nA: Try to install additional driver from system settings>aditional drivers.\n\nA: You need to find the bus id of each card with lspci | grep VGA and add each card to your /etc/X11/xorg.conf file as such\nSection \"Device\"\n        Identifier  \"Card1\"\n        Driver      \"fglrx\"\n        BusID       \"PCI:1:1:0\"\nEndSection\n\nSection \"Device\"\n        Identifier  \"Card2\"\n        Driver      \"fglrx\"\n        BusID       \"PCI:1:2:0\"\nEndSection\n\nYou can edit your xorg.conf file with any text editor, but you will need sudo rights for that.\n", "Q: Multiple Dropbox accounts on the same computer Has anyone tried running multiple Dropbox accounts on one computer? What I would like is for every user to have their own Dropbox account/folder. On the Dropbox Help Center they write:\n\nFor our advanced users\nAnother option is to use a different Dropbox account for each user login on your computer. While this technically means you can have several Dropbox folders on the same computer, you will have to switch between each user account to take advantage of Dropbox's syncing features. This method is best for groups or families that have individual Dropbox accounts and use unique user logins on the same computer.\n\nHas anyone tried this setup in Ubuntu? My question has two parts:\n\n*\n\n*Does it work in the simple case when only one user is logged in at a time?\n\n\n*What happens if two users are logged in (I log in as user one, then switch to user two without logging out)? Does the synchronization go haywire?\n\nA: I went ahead and tried this out. The first installation was successful in the normal way; when I tried running Dropbox for the second user, I was prompted to download the proprietary daemon. It seemed strange to me that I would need to do this twice, but I did it and set up the second account successfully, too.\nSo far I haven't noticed any adverse effects, and I've had both users signed in simultaneously.\n\nA: Dropbox installs to your home directory. This is true across platforms - we use it on Mac, Windows, and Linux. In all cases, installing it for one user only sets it up for that specific user. If I need it in two accounts I have to install and configure it separately for both accounts. This makes sense from a security standpoint (it shares only your personal documents, not a single shared location that all users can access) and from a use-case standpoint (it's generally used for syncing data between computers, not for syncing between accounts on one system).\n", "Q: No sound output (MSI K8N NEO4/CK804 AC'97) I have a K8N NEO4 motherboard with a built in AC'97 sound card.

At the present, you are forcing the single user splash, but still handing off to virtual terminal 7. Alter this code to the following:\nvt.handoff=1\n\nwhich should place you into the correct state. Have not tried, but know that grub2 used to have an issue with this particular code. See Bug #916306 in Launchpad.\n\nA: I am very skeptical that it would work because single mode does not enable network in a usual way. \nIf I'm right, when you'll succeed : you'll be able to manipulate only what the tftp has provided.\njust in case :\ntry to change :\nappend ro initrd=initrd.img root=/dev/nbd0 init=/sbin/init-ltsp nomodeset quiet splash **single** plymouth:force-splash vt.handoff=7 nbdroot=:ltsp_i386\n\ninto :\nappend ro initrd=initrd.img root=/dev/nbd0 init=/sbin/init-ltsp nomodeset single vt.handoff=7 nbdroot=:ltsp_i386\n\nBut I repeat : Making it work is quite unlikely/paradoxical because single mode or init 1 is without network and LTSP needs a network link to be able to work.

I am attempting to remove bookmarks from the Places sidebar in Nautilus 3.6. Specifically, I would like to remove the \"Pictures\" item.\nI have found answers for older versions in which one can remove or edit entries in ~/.config/user-dirs.dirs. However, this does not seem to work in 3.6. I am running Ubuntu 12.10 with Gnome.\nRemoving things in the bookmarks menu does not seem to change anything and the option to remove by right clicking is grayed out.\nThanks!\n\nA: You need to comment out entries in the following file:\n~/.config/user-dirs.dirs \n\n\nA: This answer is also something of a tutorial for newbies.\nUgh.  Just looked down.  It reformatted my nice, readable \noutline. #$!\nIMHO space in File windows' \"Places\" sidebars is valuable.  You \n  can use them to add quick jumps to where YOU need to go \n  frequently, so I wanted to ditch some of the defaults to \n  make more room.  I decided I didn't need Music, Pictures, \n  and Videos.  The folders are still there in my home folder \n  if I need to use them.  I'm just not big on multimedia.\nIn Raring (13.04; with the default \"Unity\" desktop) I ran into \nseveral challenges;\n\n\n*\n\n*User-added \"Places items can be removed using the pop-up \n menu you get by right-clicking the item, but that option \n is grayed out for the system's default items.\n\n*The real answer lies in Geekdom (this is still Linux, after \n all, although wonderfully slick nowadays.)   It involves \n editing a couple of configuration files, but there seem \n to be several levels of defaults that tend to restore the \n status quo behind your back. \n\n\nWhat I eventually had to do to accomplish my goal was:\n\n\n*\n\n*edit the file at  ~/.config/user-dirs.dirs\n\n*\n\n*save a backup copy in the same folder under a recognizably \naltered name\n\n*edit our target file\n\n*\n\n*delete the unwanted lines\n\n*save the modified file\n\n\n\n*edit /etc/xdg/user-dirs.defaults\n\n*\n\n*cd /etc/xdg/\n\n*sudo cp user-dirs.defaults user-dirs.defaults.orig  # backup copy\n\n*sudo -H gedit user-dirs.defaults\n\n*\n\n*delete the offending lines\n\n*save the modified file\n\n\n\n*reboot\n\n\nNotes:  with added explanations for newbies...\n\n\n*\n\n*it should work smoothly if you do both edits in one session, \n     but if you try to do it piecemeal starting with just \n     modifying   ~/.config/user-dirs.dirs  it won't work \n     (it'll be automatically restored) and you'll have to \n     do it again after fixing /etc/xdg/user-dirs.defaults.\n     I know this from personal experience.  :o)\n     these actions are easily performed with normal GUI \n     applications like Files and Text Editor.  ~/ is \n     shell (Terminal) shorthand for your home directory \n     (a folder in the file system: the absolute path is \n     something like  /Home/YOURUSERNAME/  .)\n\n\n*\n\n*not absolutely necessary, but a good habit to cultivate\n\n*it should be obvious which ones, depending on what you \n want to eliminate.

Original users are by default) and proceed \n to pretend you're \"root\" (the \"superuser\" but be careful \n -- you could break something if you mess around.)\n\n*this brings up a normal-looking instance of the Text Editor\n but with the necessary permissions so the \"Save\" doesn't\n fail.

There are four layers of variables; the first one that is set takes precedence:\n\n\n*\n\n*LANGUAGE — don't use it, it's rarely useful and can cause bugs.

When the network went down shortly later I was clicking through my connections and found my ethernet connection (which I never use, and was unplugged before and after) had last been in use 40 minutes earlier (while I left it unattended). This ethernet port \"unfolds\" from the laptop and was unfolded (could have been when I took it out of my bag) which is unusual, I did not consciously open it.

Now I'm having a bit of confusion about how to clean up the original Wubi install.\nHere's the setup: two hard drives, /dev/sda contains my Windows 7 install, and /dev/sdb is a secondary drive with a large partition for data. I had Wubi installed on /dev/sdb1, and have now created two new partitions sdb2 and sdb3 for the installation and swap respectively.\nOn booting, the computer starts the Windows boot manager with two options, Windows and Ubuntu (this is the behaviour I want, as I use Windows the majority of the time and don't want to accidentally boot to Ubuntu while Windows is hibernated); but now the grub loader on choosing the Ubuntu option has suddenly become rather crowded. It seems that Wubi has been left intact at the top of the list, with the migrated version (on /dev/sdb2) pushed lower down on the list. \nThis has left me with two questions:\n\n\n*\n\n*How do I remove the Wubi installation from the grub list? \n\n*Is it safe now to uninstall Wubi from within Windows while still allowing its boot manager to direct to Grub on the second drive?\n\n\nCheers.\nEDIT: I've tried using the Ubuntu-Tweak program as advised below, and it raised rather an interesting question. There were a couple of old kernel versions which were also being shown in the grub list, and that I'd removed. Trying to run any of those gives an error along the lines of \"You need to load the kernel first\". sudo update-grub didn't take them off the list, and in fact according to the status output it should have also added Windows to grub (which it hadn't). Rebooted into Windows and ran bcdedit, and it looks like it's using Wubi's version of grub with the new version added (hence why update-grub isn't helping at all). This is the relevant section from the bcdedit output:\nReal-mode Boot Sector\n---------------------\nidentifier              {816916df-c233-11e0-a9e6-883a7e390b89}\ndevice                  partition=G:\npath                    \\ubuntu\\winboot\\wubildr.mbr\ndescription             Ubuntu\n\nwhere \"G:\\ubuntu\" was the original install folder for Wubi.\nWhen I ran the migration script in the first place it said that it was installing Grub to /dev/sdb - but this on its own isn't a partition. Is there somewhere particular where the migration script could have installed Grub, i.e. somewhere I can point the bootloader so that it will use the correct version of Grub? (After that I'm pretty sure the question about uninstalling Wubi is a moot point)\n\nA: The Wubi migration will only ever install the Grub bootloader on the drive you are migrating to. In this case /dev/sdb. It does this to make things simpler (and I believe it's the safest option). So the easiest way to boot the migrated install is to set /dev/sdb to boot first in the BIOS options.\nThe way Wubi boots - and the way you are booting right now - is from the Windows Boot Manager (BCD store), wubildr.mbr (in the \\ubuntu\\winboot directory), then wubildr (C:\\wubildr), then the grub.cfg from inside the Wubi install (the root.disk). This is where you are booting your migrated install from. If you uninstall Wubi ALL these things will be removed (not the Windows Boot Manager but it won't show, because the Wubi entry is deleted).\nSo you cannot boot the migrated install with the Wubi boot method after getting rid of Wubi. You can instead install grub to the migrated partition and use easyBCD to do it. But personally I wouldn't recommend this. If you have to boot from the drive containing windows (in your case /dev/sda) instead do this:\n\n\n*\n\n*Boot the migrated install\n\n*Install grub to the MBR. Assuming the drive you boot from is /dev/sda you would run: sudo grub-install /dev/sda\n\n*Change the boot order so Windows is first.\n\n\nCode:\nsudo mv /etc/grub.d/30_os-prober /etc/grub.d/09_os-prober\nsudo update-grub\n\nThese last commands just change the order in which Grub generates the menu entries, placing the Windows entry (generated out of 30_os-prober) first.\nPS. since you have already tweaked your grub menu on the migrated install, you probably just have to install Grub to /dev/sda to get things to work right and can leave the grub scripts alone.\n", "Q: How can I use Cron to run shells scripts at a fixed time? I am wanting to learn cron and I searched for some quality tutorials. I found How do I set up a cron job.\nMy goal is to have a folder on a network that will have sub-folders.  Each sub-folder is a particular script that will be executed by the cron.  I don't want to overload our system so how can I create the cron the run a shell script after the assigned time and previous script is ran?\nExample:\nMain Folder\n    Sub1 - script1\n    Sub2 - script2\n    Sub3 - script3\n\nCron 10:01 - runs script1\nCron 10:02 - runs script2\nCron 10:03 - runs script3\nCron 10:04 - runs script1\nCron 10:05 - runs script2\n\n\nA: Idea Outline\nYour friend is an old fashioned cron companion at.\n\nat  and  batch  read  commands  from  standard  input or a specified file which are to be executed at a later time, using /bin/sh\n\nCombine this with run-parts.\n\nrun-parts - run scripts or programs in a directory\n\nThe idea is that you write a cron job which starts the scripts in the \"sub folders\" with the use of run-parts.\nIf you want to parallelise the execution depending on the system load, you can wrap the execution of each single script with batch.\nExample\nOn my installations I use my own wrapper script batchme. This provides some enhancements for mailing reports and output. \nThe cron.{daily,weekly,monthly} scripts are wrapped in my crontab this way:\n@midnight   root  test -x /usr/sbin/anacron ||  for script in $( run-parts --list  /etc/cron.daily)  ; do batchme --quiet --info \"cron-daily ${script}\" ${script} ; done\n\n@weekly   root  test -x /usr/sbin/anacron ||  for script in $( run-parts --list  /etc/cron.weekly) ; do batchme --quiet --info \"cron-weekly ${script}\" ${script} ; done\n\n@monthly        root  test -x /usr/sbin/anacron ||  for script in $( run-parts --list  /etc/cron.monthly); do batchme --quiet --info \"cron-monthly ${script}\" ${script} ; done\n\n\nA: Write yet a 4th script which calls the first 3 scritps in order.\n #! /bin/sh\n/path/to/script1\n/path/to/script2\n/path/to/script3\n\nThen call the 4th from cron. The most common problem with cron is that it runs with a minimal shell, so call all the scripts, including the 4th script, by the full path.\nIf you are having problems with that, post your cron entry and further details on what the problem you are having.\n\nA: Instead of calling a new script every minute or so via cron I would call one script and put all your code in that one script. Then use the sleep command (assuming you are scripting in bash, if not then the equivalent for that scripting language), to wait a specific interval before executing the next part of the script. This will ensure time between the scripts and they will only run once the other script has completed successfully.\nAn example could be:\nCron (Run the script every 15min)\n\n*/15 * * * * /path/to/script\n\nScript\n #!/bin/bash\n if command\n       then\n                   command executed successfully\n                   sleep 120\n\n       else\n                   command failed so\n                   execute all commands up to fi\n       fi\n\nNotice the sleep 120 which tells bash to wait 2 minutes or 120 seconds before executing the next line.\n", "Q: Where is \"Show position of the mouse when the Control key is pressed\" I am using Ubuntu 13.04.\nCTRL Key in VirtualBox is not working for me, that's because the \"Show position of the mouse...\" is hogging the CTRL key.\nI don't see an option to disable this in the Mouse settings.

The drawbacks depend on the virtualization software you will be using but pe prepared to have issues when accessing\n\n\n*\n\n*hardware graphical acceleration (not all features of your graphic card will be exposed to the VM).  \n\n*sound devices (partly integrated or emulated but still not all features may work as expected).  \n\n*unusual proprietary hardware (especially when they come as a PCI card).  \n\n*USB devices (USB 3.0 acess may not be available).  \n\n*Application that need fast hard drive access (only a virtual disc is provided).\n\n\nIn practise you will probably not notice much of these drawback other than a drop in performance because most hardware will be accessible. But be prepared that not all and every hardware you may use on your host will also operate the same on the guest system.\n\nA: There are several differences.\nFirst you speak of functionality and experience. The latter is really hard to see if you don't want performance to play a part, so I'm going to file that as \"subjective\". But the former has some points.\nOverall you can do a lot, but the biggest issue you have is that you are not running a real machine per definition, and so the hardware support can be limited, or at least different. This might have the effect that your videocard isn't support to it's fullest. The effect of that might be big (no support for 3d for instance) or a bit less (more experience/performace).\nThe same thing goes for connections like USB. You connect your phone to your host computer. It's not a given you will be able to connect to it for development for instance on your guest (the VM). It could be, there are ways do pass on USB information, and for common things like controllers this will be easy. But the more obscure your hardware or goal, the harder it will be to make the VM react as if the hardware was connected directly.\nSo there is no global problem in functionality, but there can be many specific ones.\nAnd don't forget performance, this can be real killer, but doesn't have to be.\n", "Q: Trying to install an openVPN GUI messed up sudoers I installed openVPN successfully but I would like to get remote desktop access with it, as is the case with openVPN in Windows.

I'm not an expert at all, I've just followed various instruction available in the web. Now, if the OS manual selection is on CSM OS it will boot Ubuntu, giving me the option of booting Windows (loader). but if I press that, it will tell me that the boot is corrupted and I can't go on. If I re-boot and select Ubuntu it boots it normally. Now, if on the other hand the OS MANUAL SELECTION IS ON \"UEFI\" OR \"UEFI AND CSM OS\", it will start Windows 8 automatically. So, basically, I have to manually change it every time I want to switch from Ubuntu to Win 8 and vice versa, which is time consuming and little annoying. Now, I repeat, I am very ignorant about these things, I just follow instruction carefully but I don't know the language at all.

Thanks a mil for your help. Fabrizio\n\nA: UEFI AND CSM OS\nmean\nUEFI and Compatibility Support Module OS\nIf ubuntu start with CSM, it mean you installed it as bios boot, while win8 is uefi boot.\nIf you want boot twice from grub, or uefi menu of your board, you must convert ubuntu from bios to UEFI.\nIf boot repair has failed, it mean you have not fullfilled every pre-requisite to install UEFI boot\n\nA: Concerning the Samsung firmware bug, see Matthew Garrett's blog post on the subject. In brief, it's possible to brick recent Samsungs even from Windows. There was a fix for the most common path to creating a brick in Linux, but that fix won't prevent all such problems in Linux, and certainly not in Windows.\nUnfortunately, this means that, at the moment, the only way to be sure of not bricking a recent Samsung laptop is to run no OSes in EFI mode. This means re-installing Windows or converting it to boot in BIOS/CSM/legacy mode (not an easy or well-documented task). Given the OP's current Linux booting problems, I'd say that it's best to just start over with both OSes. The trouble is that you'll need a retail Windows disc to install Windows in BIOS/CSM/legacy mode, although you should be able to use your current serial number, if you can borrow a disc with the same version of Windows you have installed. (The serial number should be accessible from one of the information dialog boxes in Windows, but I don't have details handy, offhand.) You'll need to completely wipe the partition table and convert it to a Master Boot Record (MBR) format. I recommend using GParted or parted for this: Select Device -> Create Partition Table in GParted, or mklabel msdos in parted.\n", "Q: how to install websocket++ dependencies? I'm trying to develop websocket applications in c++.\nI've chosen to use websocket++ since it's a no-nonsense #include that doesn't try to fallback to ajax and could potentially be used with any other #include.\nI'm not too sure exactly what packages are required to take full advantage of websocket++.\nPlease show me the name of these packages except the boost libraries which I'm pretty sure can be installed with libboost-all-dev.\nHere's the list https://github.com/zaphoyd/websocketpp/wiki/Building-a-program-with-websocketpp:\nLibrary Required for\nboost_system    Builds that use ASIO or build environments without std::error_code\nboost_regex Build environments without std::regex\nboost_random    Client role only, build environments without std::random\nlibcrypto   Required for TLS socket component\nlibssl  Required for TLS socket component\nlibz    Required for compression extension support\nlibpthread  Required on posix for thread support\nlibrt   Required on posix for high resolution timer support (some examples)\n\n\nA: librt, libpthread, and libz should be included by a base Ubuntu install. It is likely that libcrypto and libssl are as well. What will not be installed by default are the development headers. Packages build-essential and libssl-dev should cover most, if not all of it.\nAlso keep in mind that the boost versions installed by apt lag the boost.org releases by over a year. 12.10 includes boost from Nov 2011, 13.04 will include boost from Feb 2012.\nDue to some more extensive recent changes to the boost libraries to align them with C++11, there may be some feature limitations or workarounds necessary if you are not supplying your own more recent build of boost.\n", "Q: Lubuntu on Virtual Machine: (minimum) disk space requirements? \nMinimum system\n  requirements\n  for Xubuntu (...)\n  \n  \n*\n  \n*5 GB of disk space\n  \n*With Lubuntu, you can use computers with even less memory.\n  \n\nI read the above as Xubuntu and Lubuntu both requiring a minimum of 5 GB free disk space. For argument's sake, let's say the free disk space requirement were indeed 5 GB for the regular, non-virtual installation of Lubuntu.\n\n\n*\n\n*Would a virtual installation (e.g. in VMWare, VirtualBox, Xen) then necessarily require 5 GB of real, physical space, too?\n\n\nBack in the day, I worked a little with MS Windoze Virtual PC, but don't recall the \"conversion factor\" of virtual to physical disk space; but I'm pretty sure it's not \"unity\" ;) ... but please do correct me if I'm wrong !!\nps: Futher, I'm aware of two installation methods: standard and alternate, the latter designed especially for systems short of memory (RAM). I didn't yet check the exact options the alternate installer would offer, e.g. selecting which programs not to install, thus reducing the free disk space requirement.\n\nA: There is no difference in disk space requirements depending on whether you install Ubuntu on a physical or on a virtual machine. I even can't think of a possible reason for those requirements to be different - are bytes only 6 bits when you run on VirtualBox? Just joking.\nThe amount of disk space the installer requires to proceed with the installation, however, is not calculated based on real disk usage - this is a ballpark figure which is hard-coded in the installation script, and is around 2 times more than the space which will actually be taken after the install - to allow for copying, creating temporary files and other stuff during the installation. \nI'm finding that the figure is a bit on the safe side, so if you want to install, say, Lubuntu on a machine with only 4Gb of disk space you can edit the installer script and adjust the amount of disk space the installer requires. I don't remember the exact location of the file to be edited though.\n\nA: As we can see from your tags you are using Virtual Box for virtualization. Then you can choose a dynamically allocated virtual hard drive:\n\nA dynamically allocated file will only grow in size when the guest actually stores data on its virtual hard disk. It will therefore initially be small on the host hard drive and only later grow to the size specified as it is filled with data. Virtual Box Manual\n\nSo in practise you can give your virtual machine far more disk space than needed, but only those bytes that are really used by the VM are reserved from your remaining hard drive space. This also means that it is of no practical benefit and thus not recommended to go down to the lower limit of system requirements when creating your Xubuntu or Lubuntu VM.\nIn case you are short of memory on your drive consider\n\n\n*\n\n*installing without a swap  \n\n*avoid taking snapshots of your machine  \n\n*do not \"save the machine state\" on power off.\n\n", "Q: Install Acer Aspire One ZG5 microphone on Ubuntu 12.10 I just installed Ubuntu 12.10 on a Acer Aspire One ZG5 (AOA 110), then Skype, and I can't make the microphone work.

All the above work like a charm on Windows 7 and Windows 8.\nI'm really trying to give Ubuntu a try but it's starting not to be such a great experience when I can't get something this simple to work after two days :|\nAnd yes I have double (triple) checked that the volume on all devices is not turned off and that no mute setting is on (including auto-mute in alsamixer).\nDoes anyone have a clue what could be wrong ?\nThanks\n(Also, please assume I have no knowledge at all of Ubuntu since it's pretty much the case)\nEdit: Here is the output of \"sudo aplay -l\"\n**** List of PLAYBACK Hardware Devices ****\ncard 0: PCH [HDA Intel PCH], device 0: ALC889 Analog [ALC889 Analog]\n  Subdevices: 1/1\n  Subdevice #0: subdevice #0\ncard 0: PCH [HDA Intel PCH], device 1: ALC889 Digital [ALC889 Digital]\n  Subdevices: 1/1\n  Subdevice #0: subdevice #0\ncard 1: NVidia [HDA NVidia], device 3: HDMI 0 [HDMI 0]\n  Subdevices: 0/1\n  Subdevice #0: subdevice #0\ncard 1: NVidia [HDA NVidia], device 7: HDMI 0 [HDMI 0]\n  Subdevices: 1/1\n  Subdevice #0: subdevice #0\ncard 1: NVidia [HDA NVidia], device 8: HDMI 0 [HDMI 0]\n  Subdevices: 1/1\n  Subdevice #0: subdevice #0\ncard 1: NVidia [HDA NVidia], device 9: HDMI 0 [HDMI 0]\n  Subdevices: 1/1\n  Subdevice #0: subdevice #0\n\nMy primary sound card (i.e. not the external MOTU one) comes from my motherboard, it's a Gigabyte Z68 HD (or something like that, will try to find the exact model).\n\nA: I do not have single clue why but here is what fixed my problem (completely by mistake):\nUsing pavucontrol I have disabled \"GF110 High Definition Controller\" and the sound will only work if \"Built-in audio\" is set to anything Analog. It will not work if the setting is digital. Can anyone comment on why that would happen ?\nThanks.\n", "Q: How can I back-up my Home without including previous back-ups?

For some reason TeXworks decided it didn't like those guys and stopped compiling. \nI tried updating texlive-latex-base and that didn't work. I then entered \napt-file -x search '/pcatcode$' \n\nto find the directory the package lives in and I got\n/usr/share/texmf-texlive/tex/latex/amsrefs/pcatcode.sty.\n\nI tried cding into this directory, but I was told this directory doesn't exist. I did the same thing for amsrefs.sty and got the same result. \n\nA: The files amsrefs.sty and pcatcode.sty are not included in the package texlive-latex-base so that is probably why you are told that the directory does not exist.\nThe files you are looking for is found in another TeX Live package, namely texlive-bibtex-extra. Install it and your document should compile. To install it do e.g.\nsudo apt-get install texlive-bibtex-extra\n\n", "Q: Deja Dup resolves host name incorrectly, adds ISP hostname PROBLEM:\nI backup to an SSH server via Deja Dup.

I have my hostname in /etc/hostname. Python resolves the correct hostname with socket.getfqdn().\nWhere should I look to troubleshoot? I have already reset my router to factory default.\nWhat could cause Deja Dup, or duplicity, to tack on my ISPs name to my computer name? \n\nA: I had changed my hostname in /etc/hostname but I forgot to change it in /etc/hosts. Edit hosts file so that it matches hostname and duplicity is all better.\n", "Q: Revert back to Nouveau drivers I was trying to install the proprietary nvidia drivers for my optimus laptop. This resulted in my GUI disappearing, I can only see my desktop background (can still open terminal and right-click the desktop to get into options). I have followed lots of tutorials that don't result in any change. How can I switch back to the Nouveau drivers that are already installed?\nI have an nvidia 660m with optimus\n\nA: One of the following should work:\nsudo apt-get remove --purge nvidia-current\nsudo apt-get remove --purge nvidia-current-updates\n\nFollow that with an\nsudo apt-get autoremove\n\nPlus, you may want to start afresh on your X configuration\nsudo mv /etc/X11/xorg.conf /etc/X11/xorg.conf.backup\n\nIf you are still having problems, could you please clarify which instructions you followed to install the nvidia drivers and what you tried so-far to remove them.\n\nA: Ok, I found the solution to my problem. After going through all the driver changes that I did, the unity plugin became disabled in Compiz. To fix this, open a terminal, type ccsm to open Compiz, then enable the 'Ubuntu Unity Plugin' and disable all the conflicts and reboot. That seems to have fixed my problems. Turns out it was only loosely a driver problem after all.\n", "Q: Why is my Ubuntu box shutting itself off? I just built a relatively cheap Ubuntu box for use as a home server.  I had a monster headache getting my Win 8 machine to talk to it via samba, but this is beside the point.\nI've now been attempting to transfer large amounts of media across the network to store on my home server and it keeps shutting itself off.  I have set the \"when to suspend\" option in the power settings to \"never\" and it's still doing it.  It doesn't even seem to offer any warning.  It's behind me right now as I type this post and I'll just hear that \"power down\" sound (all the fans spinning down, etc.) and it's off.  When I turn it back on, it goes straight from POST to the login screen, so I'm guessing this is some manner of suspend/hibernate behavior.  And... it just did it again.  This is getting really frustrating.\nAnybody know of anything else I can check?  I'm praying it isn't a hardware failure.  I just bought the stuff.\n\nA: Sounds like a power supply issue. I would try looking at some of the logs in /var/logs/. There might be a clue. Maybe as soon as something happened a shutdown signal is seen. Who knows? See how it runs with the bare minimum peripherals. Unplug everything you can and try to narrow down the problem. Since it's a custom build it might be consuming more power than you expected.\n", "Q: Using Remmina with VPN I've been looking for a way to use Remmina over a VPN connection which I have already configured. VPN connection works properly, but I'd like to remotely access the Windows computer in a lab, and would like to use Remmina. Could somebody give/link me a step-by-step tutorial for doing so?\n\nA: Firstly the machine must have a static IP address or some sort of DDNS setup running so that the address will be static and won't change. Once that is confirmed you can follow the instructions below.\n\n\n*\n\n*Open Remmina and select the New Connection icon.\n\n*Then enter:\n\n\n*\n\n*Name: the name for the connection\n\n*Server: the ip/dyn-dns address of the machine\n\n*Username: the username of the user account you would like to use to access the machine.\n\n*Password: the password for the account\n\n\n\n\n*Click Save\n\n*Select the connection and then click the Connect icon.\n", "Q: What features should I check on my VPS in order to have a secure box? I have a VPS with Ubuntu 12.10 server edition, an I connect to it from public/university. I host some web applications on it. I have always been concerned with security issues. What features is needed to be checked in order to have a secure VPS?\n\nA: Implement the hardening techniques outlined in the CIS Benchmark guides for:\n\n*\n\n*Apache\n\n*Debian\n\n*MySQL - if you are running this in your instance.\n\nI would also run a vulnerability scanner such as Nessus against it to determine any additional security weaknesses that may exist.\n", "Q: Vim - up-down line movements the cursor changes column position While editing a simple text file where every line is nearly to the end of screen, I was expecting vim to retain the column position as I used j and k to move up and down.\nSurprisingly, it does not happen. I am using a default install of vim on ubuntu 12.10 and a few plugins (unicycle, speeddating, tex, Align, Alignmaps, genutils, html, foldutil, scratch, surround).\nThe behaviour I am referring to is: I am in C57-L5. Line 6 is 80 characters long. I hit j, cursor jumps to C1-L6 instead of C57-L6.\nWhat could be wrong? How can I set it right?\n\nA: open ~/.vimrc and add these 2 lines\nnnoremap j gj\nnnoremap k gk\n\nclose and restart vim.\nps: it will still go to the first column on empty lines, and you might want to set nowrap.\n", "Q: reallocating free space from one partition to another Im running ubuntu oneiric server edition.

Your best bet would likely be using an Ubuntu live cd/usb to do this. I don't believe there is a solution that will not require rebooting your PC.\nThis link may be helpful for re-sizing the partitions from a live cd\nhttp://www.howtogeek.com/114503/how-to-resize-your-ubuntu-partitions/\nThis thread can help you make a live cd/usb How can I create a LiveCD/LiveDVD/LiveUSB?\n", "Q: Ubuntu 12.04 - touchpad not working I installed the 64-bit Ubuntu 12.04 on my HP Pavilion laptop, but the touchpad isn't working. I've already tried reinstalling, so that won't fix it.\nI've managed to get the terminal open using Ctrl+Alt+T, but I don't know what I'm doing.

Someone else was trying to hook my laptop up to a TV, and accidentally hit Fn + F9.  The Mousepad control still showed it as enabled; restarting, disabling then enabling - nothing worked until I hit the right hotkeys.\n\nA: The following steps in the article solved my problem like a charm:\nIs Your Laptop Touchpad Not Working After Upgrading To Ubuntu 11.10?

The solutions above in the comments could work :) . \nOf course if you can upgrade your RAM-memory up to 1Gb, then you can easily work with Xubuntu, what is more a vivid operating system than Lubuntu. \nThese RAM-banks can be easily found second hand, and sometimes even new in several webshops.\nI'd suggest that this is an option you simply can't refuse (lol) . \nAt the other hand a P4 is mostly an older computer what should be replaced for something from the newest generation, but that is, for Xubuntu, not entire nessecary. \nI'd go for the RAM-upgrade (this is the cheapest way for catching up with the new generations of Linux) . \n", "Q: Installing google Go in Ubuntu Can Google Go be installed on Ubuntu?

If that fails, try reinstalling it using your graphical package manager or aptitude. If that fails too, set sudo's setuid bit manually:\npkexec chmod u+s /usr/bin/sudo\n\nIf that fails as well with error \"pkexec: must be setuid root\", then check that the filesystem containing /usr/bin hasn't been accidentally mounted with the nosuid option set. Examine the output of mount.\nIf that is not the case either, then check if any binary in /usr/bin has its setuid bit set, using:\nfind /usr/bin -perm 4755\n\nThis should list at least passwd, sudo, and the likes. If there is none, then surely a stray cosmic ray has kicked those setuid bits over (or maybe this was you after all, with an overzealous chmod -s * because it is rumoured that setuid is bad?)\nEither way, you will first have to reestablish your sudo rights. I have described the way to do that in a separate answer to this question. Once you have those, reinstall every package containing a setuid binary, or chmod each binary manually, as shown at the top of this answer.\n\nUnfortunately, as the answer to another question states, there is no easy way to find out which binaries in Ubuntu are installed setuid root. \nHere is, for reference, the list on a nearly pristine 12.04. Package names on the left, binaries on the right of the colon:\n$ find {/usr,}/bin -perm 4755 | xargs dpkg -S\npasswd: /usr/bin/chsh\niputils-tracepath: /usr/bin/traceroute6.iputils\nmtr-tiny: /usr/bin/mtr\npasswd: /usr/bin/gpasswd\nsudo: /usr/bin/sudoedit\nlogin: /usr/bin/newgrp\npasswd: /usr/bin/chfn\nsudo: /usr/bin/sudo\npasswd: /usr/bin/passwd\nlogin: /bin/su\niputils-ping: /bin/ping\nmount: /bin/umount\nmount: /bin/mount\nfuse: /bin/fusermount\niputils-ping: /bin/ping6\n\n\nA: The issue the OP has is that all setuid root binaries in /usr/bin have somehow lost their setuid bit. This causes the bootstrapping problem of setting the setuid bit back on /usr/bin/sudo without being able to sudo. Here is how to do just that:\n\n\n*\n\n*Reboot and in the Grub menu, select the \"recovery mode\" option.\n\n*When the recovery menu appears, select \"root\" to drop to a root shell. \n\n*Remount the root filesystem to be writeable:\n# mount -o remount,rw /\n\n\n*Set the setuid bit on sudo and pkexec:\n# chmod u+s /usr/bin/sudo /usr/bin/pkexec\n\nExit recovery mode and continue regular boot.\n\nA: After trying all then suggestions given to me, The only way was to Re install Ubuntu and that is what I have to do Finally.\n", "Q: Why does the sequence matter in the execution of these bash commands? There seems to be some inconsistency that I am not able to understand regarding the bash shell. \nIf I execute:\nls;date;time\nthe results of the three queries are shown in sequence. \nHowever, on interchanging date and time position, an error message pops up. \nSo if I execute:\nls;time;date\nthe error message says: bash: syntax error near unexpected token 'date'.\nCan someone explain this?\n\nA: Bash treats the built-in time as a special case, when parsing command-lines.\nAs can be read in the bash manpage, the line as typed is first split into a list:\npipeline ; pipeline\n\nwhere a pipeline is:\n[time [-p]] [ ! ] command [ [|⎪|&] command2 ... ]\n\nor in our case, simply:\ntime command\n\ni.e. if time is present, then command must also be present.\n[There is a special case that allows time to be followed by a newline, but that doesn't apply here]\nSo, in our case, we have:\ntime;date\n\nbeing split into two pipelines:\n1. time\n2. date\n\nand pipeline 1 is not well formed, since we have time without a command. Hence the error.\nNote that the command-line time doesn't work here either:\n$ /usr/bin/time;date\nUsage: /usr/bin/time [-apvV] [-f format] [-o file] [--append] [--verbose]\n\nbash parses this as expected, into 2 pipelines:\n1. /usr/bin/time\n2. date\n\nand /usr/bin/time then refuses to run with no argument. Note that this is an error from /usr/bin/time not an error from bash.\nThe reason that back-tick works is that the back-tick stops time being interpreted as a special element within the pipeline.\ni.e. with the back-tick:\n`time`;date\n\nit is parsed as two pipelines:\n1. `time`\n2. date\n\nRemember that a pipeline, in our case, is:\n[time] command\n\nand the problem initially was that we had time with no command, which isn't allowed. But now we simply have the command:\n`time`\n\nwithout the preceding time, since the back-ticks mean that time is interpreted as the command, not as a preceding word.\nSo bash then runs its builtin time with no args, which is accepted. It produces no output, and we see no error.\nNote that:\n`time`\n\nactually runs the result of the time built-in, i.e. it runs whatever the time built-in produces on stdout. But since time on its own doesn't write anything to stdout, it appears to work.\nFinally, it's been noted that this works:\ntime ; ; date\n\nwhich I can't explain, sadly :)\n\nA: The time command in your pipeline is not the /usr/bin/time binary, but the bash time built-in. Compare man time with help time. The error you see is bash failing to parse time's argument. This must either be present or be a newline. It is a newline in your first example but absent in the second.\nOn the other hand, if you were to run\nls;date;'time'\n\nor \nls;'time';date\n\nwhere the quotes around 'time' revoke its status as a reserved word, then bash has no problems parsing the line. It now parses three commands in a list, which it will execute in sequence, and /usr/bin/time will report a usage error in either case.\nAddendum\nIt was observed that though time ; date yields an error, time ; ; date does not. The likely explanation is that time ; is interpreted by bash as equivalent to time <newline>. The expression time ; ; date is then parsed as the list of time ; and date.\nThis is consistent with the observation that time ; and time ; ; are legal as well, the second being parsed as the singleton list containing time ; followed by the optional semicolon allowed after lists.\nSo another way of explaining why time ; date yields the error bash: syntax error near unexpected token 'date' is that time consumes the semicolon separating it from date. It can only do that because time is a bash reserved word.\n", "Q: How to install Java Plugin for chrome I followed the instructions in the accepted answer to this question and was able to correctly install the latest version of Java 7.\nHowever I do not have mozilla firefox installed but chrome.

I don't have a clue what is it connected with - maybe it's due to a kernel update or something. And what do those 2 lines mean.\n\nA: I had the same problem on XPS 15 L521x; it kept saying \"Checking media...\"\nI went into BIOS (UEFI) and set AUTO boot priority. IP4, IP6 and the HDD. It was set to \"LAST\", which was the HDD, but for some reason it did not work.\nSo, AUTO solved the probem.\n\nA: I just had the hard drive replaced in my Dell XPS15 because of a vibration problem. It now does something similar.\nHere is some background: I think this part is reliable information. When the computer boots with a brand new device, it is supposed to go through the \"checking media\" thing. In addition, the tech said that the first \"checking media\" message always says \"[fail]\" - always, in his experience; it apparently has something to do with scanning for USB drives and not finding any, something like that. That first \"[fail]\" does not indicate a problem.\nWhen I got my computer new, it never did the \"checking media\" thing, and booted in a second or two. Since the HD was replaced, however, it always does the \"checking media\" thing, and takes a long time to boot, like yours.\nNow my supposition. The problem here is not that the \"checking media\" says \"[fail]\"; rather, the problem is that it should not be doing the \"checking media\" thing at all. I suspect that the media is supposed to be marked as \"clean\" after a successful boot, or during a clean shutdown, something like that. But this is not happening, hence the media checks on every restart. This theory is supported by the fact that when I restart my computer, now, Windows always tells me that it experienced a serious error and didn't shut down cleanly, even when I just did a clean shutdown with no errors. So the message you quote is not a problem, it's a consequence of a problem that occurred during ?shutdown? or before.\nUPDATE: after a service call with Dell, the problem is at least partially resolved. It appears the supposition was roughly correct. The Dell tech directed me to fix the boot order. I know, it sounds unlikely. But apparently having the boot order wrong was preventing the new drive from ever getting marked as \"clean\", and hence the \"checking media\" sequence every time it was powered on. The issue is that this is a new UEFI BIOS machine and changing the boot order was a maze of twisty passages made worse by the fact that the Dell tech didn't really know how to do it either. I can recall that I had to enable Legacy boot mode, change the boot order there, disable Legacy boot mode and reenable UEFI boot mode so that Windows would boot. I will have another look and add another update if I can figure out how to be more specific.\nNow the checking media stuff is gone but this morning, it still took a long time in the BIOS and when it came up I got the \"Your PC ran into a problem\" message from Windows, indicating a likely driver issue in Windows during shutdown. This again is probably a consequence of unpacking an inconsistent/outdated Windows from the replacement HD and if you are using Ubuntu, it may not be relevant to you.\n\nA: FYI, I fixed this by going into the UEFI boot order and moving the hard drive to the top of the list, in front of the IPv4 and IPv6 boot methods.  I did not have to re-enable Legacy boot mode, or even touch it at all. :)\n", "Q: After installing with Wubi, can't boot into Ubuntu I installed Ubuntu (12.10) through Wubi and when I go to the dual boot screen, I choose Ubuntu.

I am looking to set up a new server.  I can only use Intel 520 Series 240gb MLC ssds or standard Seagate 7200rpm disks.\nThese are the non negotiable options.\nNaturally, as this is going to be running MySQL with its primary task being a MySQL server. As the biggest performance bottleneck being disk I/O, I would prefer to use the SSDs.\nI need to have close to 1TB of disk space.  Now, RAID5 does not give the best performance and is rumoured to not be best for SSDs, so I am looking at a Raid 10(1+0) setup which would give me 720gb (240gb * 3)\nI need to know how I can set this up with Ubuntu 12.04.01 LTS using software raid and to make sure that TRIM support (Discard I think its called in Linux) is enabled for the raid config.  \nHas anyone don't this successfully?  Any howto info and stuff to watch out for and basically what tools to use and so on would be of great assistance.\nIdeally, I also need to be able to boot off the SSD raid array.\nCan anyone point me in the right direction ?\nThanks.\n\nA: I know I'm being a Johnny-come-lately to this question but I'd like to see if I can shed some light on this for anyone searching.\nFirst, @ppetraki's answer is excellent.\nThe short answer to \"Can I RAID SSDs and boot from them\" is \"Yes!\". Here are instructions for 14.04. Instructions for RAID configuration on 12.04.x are identical, but this tutorial using 9.10 has pictures. Following here are some important gotchas and details I had to discover the hard way, through personal experience:\nI'm running Ubuntu 12.04.5 with the 3.8 kernel on an MD RAID0 configuration and the SSD-friendly Btrfs filesystem. I run fstrim as a weekly cron. \nMy extra Btrfs mount options from fstab:\ndefaults,ssd,ssd_spread,space_cache,compress=no,noatime\n\nThe 3.8 kernel is required if you want to use compress=no as a Btrfs mount option and may also be required for use of fstrim, the manual trim command used for scheduled trim.\nYou must also manually align partitions (on any multi-partition setup, raid or not) on the SSDs BEFORE booting to the installer because depending on the page size of your SSD, only the first partition will be properly aligned (it took me a while to catch it) and this can severely impact drive lifespan. You can do this from a command prompt within the installer or from a live usb/disc before you attempt installation. Caveat: Do the math yourself. Fdisk will lie about alignment.\nFurther reading: I think Btrfs can even create its own raid arrays.\nRegarding TRIM:\nIt's arguably unnecessary thanks to overprovisioning\n14.04 is the first release to enable TRIM support out-of-the-box but it's trivial to enable on previous distributions, provided you are using kernel 2.6.33+. \nDepending on your chosen filesystem, you can enable trim/discard by editing your fstab and setting the appropriate mount option. The difference between doing this and running it via cron is that the first will trim/discard on-the-fly and the second will do it in a lump on a schedule. I use the second.\nDoes it matter? Supposedly, the online discard (using the mount option) is not wonderfully implemented and is slow so it's \"not recommended\". I can tell you that my \"hdd\" (hehe) lights go nuts for 10-20 minutes when the weekly cron job runs but the OS responsiveness is almost completely unaffected.\nBooting from the array\nThough I don't see this in a quick scan of the ubuntu 14.04 instructions, I had to create an additional primary partition that is NOT part of my raid arrays. Disk 0 has a 500mb primary partition of ext3fs. During installation I told the installer this was to be mounted at \"/boot\" and I set the bootable flag. The bootloader is then installed here so the OS can start and then mount the RAID. The remaining Disk 0 space is divided between 2 partitions which are later used for the MD arrays that become \"/\" and \"/swap\". Disk 1 has the same, but no boot partition. Also, I only created the swap in case I need it sometime and btrfs does not support swapfiles. This partition is never mounted; after installation, I commented it out in my fstab.\nForgive all the edits, just trying to get it all out there.\n\nA: The answer is \"it depends\" and you should really understand what TRIM does before asserting such an inflexible position.\nhttp://www.spinics.net/lists/raid/msg39641.html\nMD RAID needs specific support to forward DISCARD requests and that hasn't even been proposed until 3.6, therefore the support will not be in the precise kernel. I just looked, it's not there.\nhttps://lkml.org/lkml/2012/3/11/261\nSSDs are nice and all, but they are most cost effective when combined with high RPM magnetic storage. For example, use a RAID 1 SSD array to house the filesystem journal while the filesystem is backed by a RAID 10 consisting of 15K disks.\nhttp://insights.oetiker.ch/linux/external-journal-on-ssd/\nThe higher the RPMS, the lower your worst seek time is, random IO loads benefit the most from high RPM backing stores. SQL can be write intensive, so any parity calculation is a bad idea e.g. RAID 4 and 5.\nThe organization of the RAID and the filesystem is just as important as the backing store.\nYou can always TRIM your disks manually, weekly is fine to start, you should observe what the performance impact is before running it more frequently. Oh, they will burn out so it would be a good idea to estimate how many write/delete cycles your SSDs have and service the RAID 1 one leg at a time.\nhttps://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Solid_State_Drives#Apply_TRIM_via_cron\n", "Q: Will it cost money to upload a phone application?

Is there a way to have it updated?\n\nA: Given that you say only 3.2.6 is available, it must mean that you are on Ubuntu 10.04, which for the desktop version, will be End of Life in approximately one month.\nEkiga is distributed in the Ubuntu archives, and there are newer versions available on newer versions of Ubuntu. You should upgrade to a newer version of Ubuntu to get them. Version 3.3.7 is available on Ubuntu 12.04 for example.\nYou can see what version of Ekiga is in what version of Ubuntu, here.\n", "Q: Cannot boot into Ubuntu 12.04 after reinstalling Windows 7 I had to reinstall my Windows 7 due to some problems, before that I was running a dual boot with Ubuntu 12.04, which was originally installed from Windows (via Wubi) in a separate partition. \nAfter reinstalling Windows the screen where I could choose the OS to boot to was gone, I searched for a solution and installed EasyBCD, from there installed Neogrub, added an entry for Ubuntu (tried type GRUB2 and GRUB Legacy, nothing changed). Now I get to Windows boot manager after rebooting, but if I choose Ubuntu it says 'Windows was not installed correctly', so clearly something is wrong. This is the boot menu:\nThere are a total of 3 entries listed in the bootloader.\nDefault: Windows 7\nTimeout: 15 seconds\nBoot Drive: C:\\\n\nEntry #1\nName: Windows 7\nBCD ID: {current}\nDrive: C:\\\nBootloader Path: \\Windows\\system32\\winload.exe\n\nEntry #2\nName: NeoGrub Bootloader\nBCD ID: {8355e9dd-8693-11e2-94ba-98e0820b23a5}\nDrive: C:\\\nBootloader Path: \\NST\\NeoGrub.mbr\n\nEntry #3\nName: Ubuntu\nBCD ID: {8355e9df-8693-11e2-94ba-98e0820b23a5}\nDrive: E:\\\nBootloader Path: \\NST\\AutoNeoGrub0.mbr\n\nI`m no expert, but the Bootloader Path for Entry #3 looks wrong, however I don't know how to change it (or what should I change it to).\nNow I realised I should have installed Ubuntu from a Live CD not wubi, but it's too late for that. I'm thinking there has to be some way to acces Ubuntu, cause it`s all there in its partition.\nedit: I tried running wubi to refresh my memory, now I remember what I did, I changed the  'Installation drive' from C to E, which is a partition I created just for Ubuntu and which is still there, unformatted.\n\nA: As Windows was installed with Wubi, Ubuntu would of been in the directory of Wubi. Now that you re-installed Windows 7, Wubi is deleted. So I am afraid Ubuntu is long gone.\nI would imagine if you clicked 'Upgrade' from the Windows 7 installation I would presume it created a System Restore Point. If you type in to the Start Menu 'System Restore' I guess you could have a go at recovering Wubi. But it is probably gone.\nHope this helps!  \n\nA: Something is not right in you description or I cannot understand it.\nYou said \n\n\"before that I was running a dual boot with Ubuntu 12.04, which was\n  originally installed from Windows (via Wubi) in a separate partition.\"\n\nand this cannot be happened. When use the wubi.exe installer , Ubuntu will be installed inside Windows. So no separate partitions exits .. etc. \nIf you are absolutely sure that you have installed Ubuntu via wubi.exe , then with the re-installation of Windows, Ubuntu was just gone. Via wubi.exe Ubuntu is nothing more but a program installed inside Windows. You can find it from Windows control panel and remove it like any other simple Windows program. \nIf you are unsure about the type of Ubuntu installation you followed , then I would suggest to use boot-repair and see if your boot problem solved  and/or provide here the boot-info log. \n\nA: To answer my own question (in case anybody else has this problem, it is possible to fix this. Using EasyBCD is just the first step, after creating an entry for Ubuntu (be sure to set the Type to wubi, not GRUB) you have to tell Windows where to boot Ubuntu from. To do this, open a command prompt with administrator rights, and run\nbcdedit and look at the end of the output under 'Real-Mode Boot Sector' at the identifier.\nThen run bcdedit /set {device_id} partition=X:\nwhere device_id is the ID from above and X is the partition where you installed Ubuntu.\nLastly, run \nbcedit /set {device_id} path \\your_ubuntu_path\\winboot\\wubildr.mbr\nAgain, replace device_id and 'your_ubuntu_path' with the path to the wubildr.mbr file (probably it`s in \\ubuntu\\winboot\\ on the partition where you installed Ubuntu)\nThat`s it, the dual-boot should work correctly again (at least for me it did).\n", "Q: Nvidia drivers on Ubuntu 12.10 don't work on my Mac Mini I have a 2009 Mac Mini with a Core 2 Duo processor.

It reverts to generic Ubuntu icon theme, and the screen goes dim. Programs can still be opened from Docky, but Gnome Shell is unresponsive.

Use your ubuntu partition. Then install grub\nsudo grub-install --root-directory=/ /dev/sda\n\nand, update grub\nsudo update-grub\n\nThis will work! Try it..\n\nA: There is also a bug in the installer that does not delay when the install reports as done and when grub is also written. It does not flush file writes immediately, so if you restart AS SOON as the install says it is done, it kills all processes and sometimes grub has not been written yet. \nnext time, when the install says it is done, wait half a minute.

But when i run that executable from shell script then that executable creates core dump.\nFor Example: if i run the TEST executable from prompt with arugments like:\nTEST ARGS\n\nIt runs fine. But now, I create a script a.ksh:\n#/bin/ksh\ncd PATH_TO_EXECUTABLE\nResult=Test ARGS\n\nand then runs ./a.ksh and it crash and creates a core dump. \nAny thoughts why running an binary from shell script creating core?\n\nA: Executing this in a shell:\n$ RESULT=binary args\n\nwill make the shell attempt to execute args in an environment where variable RESULT is set to the value binary. This will not be what you intended.\nApart from that: the only difference between executing a binary from a console shell and from a shell script invoked from that console shell would be in the values of environment variables.\nThe cause for the crashing binary could be anything, but a difference in PATH or LD_LIBRARY_PATH settings would be the most likely.

Check how to install Ubuntu to learn more about dual-boot installing, and the answers given to this question to try to recover your data.\nIn order to run Windows programs, you would have to install Wine and then install the applications there.\n\nA: Without knowing how you installed Ubuntu it is hard to answer this.\nThe default choice in the Ubuntu installer is \"Install alongside Windows\", and it will shrink the size of the Windows partition (if there is room and it is not messed up) and then create a Linux partition and install there. If you did that, your windows is there, and you can boot into Ubuntu on your hard drive, and restore grub by clicking on the terminal then typing:\nsudo update-grub\n\nthen, reboot.\nIf you did not select the default \"Install alongside Windows\", you may have erased windows and replaced it with just Ubuntu. If you did, reinstall Windows, then install Ubuntu again in that order.\nP.S. To be safe, you should always backup your drive before installing a new OS or new version of an OS.\n\nA: You erased it, if you use automatic installation, all partitions will be erased and used for Ubuntu.\n\nA: Sorry, but it looks like you just have Linux on there now.\nTo see what partitions you actually have, type in the terminal:\nsudo fdisk -lu\n\nBut it looks to me like you used the whole drive and all the Windows data is gone.  When you install, you reformat.  Testdisc won't help you with a low level format.\n\nA: If you locate the disk application in Ubuntu (either search in the menu or download if necessary in the app store or Synaptic package manager), it will display the format of your current partition, from there you can select to allow the largest disk within your partition to boot windows NFTS (it is imperative you choose this boot format) and once you change it to allow that boot mode you can restart your computer and load windows onto your device with the OS CD. Then once you have the system loaded onto your device you can proceed to re-install Linux.\nHope this works for you!\n", "Q: Alternative to Remmina I often have to do some work from home, so I connect via VPN and RPD to my Workplace! \nUnfortunately with Remmina I can´t get AltGr-Shortcuts working, it doesn´t show TextCursor in Editors and the Performance is also not very well which is really annoying when you have to work a few hours with it!\nSo does anyone know a better RDP-Client for Linux it doesn´t have to be OpenSource or Free, I'm willing to pay for a good RPD-Client!\n\nA: *\n\n*rdesktop  - terminal app.\n\n\nor\n\n\n*\n\n*krdc - part of KDE\n\n\n\n\nA: Try freeRDP (http://www.freerdp.com/) which is wrapped by Remmina and provides all the actual functionality.

However, my transfer speeds are extremely slow.\nIts weird because some days (very rarely) I get speeds upto 60 Kb/s and when downloading something via terminal, I sometimes get as much as 95-108 Kb/s. \nBut when I use transmission, the transfer speed for my torrent files stays painfully slow. As soon as I start downloading the torrent, the speed shoots up to 70-90 Kb/s but then right away it drops down and stays at 15-28 Kb/s.\nThe first time I used rtorrent and downloaded a torrent via terminal, it downloaded @ 55-70 Kb/s. But now, even rtorrent gives me the same speeds as transmission. The torrent I am downloading has plenty of seeds.\nIn windows I get an average speed of 50 Kb/s. BUT I HATE WINDOWS.\nAlso, using transmission to download torrents absolutely brings page-loading in chromium to a screeching halt.\nSo what should I do?\nPlease help!!\n\nA: It seems to me that you're already getting superior speeds at certain times to any other operating system you have tried on your computer. Downloading Ubuntu will not automatically speed up your internet speed; that service is determined by your internet service provider (ISP). I would recommend moving as close to your wireless access point as possible, or even using an ethernet cord if it is not too much of a hassle.\nOne possibility (but this is a guess) for the apparently slower rate is that Ubuntu might update the current download speed more frequently, but there is nothing within Ubuntu that would slow download speeds. It is more likely a hardware issue, either related to your signal strength, the memory type where the download is saving, or the amount of memory allocated for Ubuntu to run.\n", "Q: Skype off when write in chat and open the call video in the same time I don't understand why when I open a video call and write in the same time, skype turns off \nand back again for open it.\nI tried again and found the same problem: Skype doesn't let me write while I'm in a video call...

Normally I'd just let everything run out as best I can and then hard reboot, but I'm wondering if there's any way I can save it. Ctrl+Alt+F1 doesn't seem to have any useful effect -- it gets rid of X on one display, but I never get an interactive shell back.\nThanks!\n\nA: Well, I managed to address my primary disincentive for hard rebooting -- I had a (long) ssh process running on that machine which I'd failed to nohup, but I needed a file from the machine to work on. Managed to take control of the process via an ssh connection from a different machine, and scp'ed the relevant file off meanwhile. Whee!

Can anyone help me?\n\nA: Ubuntu is not an application, but an operating system. It doesn't run on Windows, it runs instead of Windows. You downloaded an ISO image: burn it onto a CD-ROM (you can do this from Windows), then put the CD-ROM into your CD drive and reboot the server.

Pre-reqs\nTo make sure you have all the pre-requisites for compiling code, run the following command:\nsudo apt-get install build-essential linux-headers-$(uname -r)\n\n1. Configure ALSA driver (skip this step if you are in Ubuntu 13.10+)\nNow you need to configure which sound devices should be used with ALSA. I'll explain the instruction for having two sound devices, Intel HD Audio, and the E-MU 1212m. If you need ALSA to include another, you need to find the name of the ALSA driver that supports this device. In order to do that, check ALSA's sound card matrix here. If your sound card is supported, you should find a driver for it in the list of drivers. For Intel HD Audio, the driver is hda-intel, and for E-MU 1212m, the driver is emu10k1. \nTo configure the driver, go to the folder where you extracted alsa-driver in a terminal, and run the following command. \n./configure --with-cards=hda-intel,emu10k1 --with-sequencer=yes --with-isapnp=no  --with-oss=no --with-kernel=/lib/modules/$(uname -r)/build\n\n--with-cards specifies a comma-separated list of the drivers that you need. As for the other options, I have the driver include a sequencer, specified the that the device is not plug and play, specified that OSS is not used, and specified the kernel. Although you shouldn't need to, but you can add additional configuration options for the ALSA driver as necessary. You can learn more about configuring ALSA driver by running the command ./configure --help.\nNote: If you are not sure which card you have, try running lshw -c sound in the terminal. It will list all the sound hardware. If it is a PCI, it should also show up when you run lspci | grep audio.\n2. Patch the emu10k1 driver (skip this step if you are in Ubuntu 13.10+)\nNext we need to apply a small patch to one of the files.\nIn the same folder, open the file ./alsa-kernel/pci/emu10k1/emu10k1_main.c with a text editor of your choice. Find the line with\nstatic struct snd_emu_chip_details emu_chip_details[] = {\nRight below it, insert the following:\n{.vendor = 0x1102, .device = 0x0008, .subsystem = 0x40071102,\n  .driver = \"Audigy2\", .name = \"E-mu 1010 PCIe\",\n  .id = \"EMU1010\",\n  .emu10k2_chip = 1,\n  .ca0108_chip = 1,\n  .spk71 = 1,\n  .emu_model = EMU_MODEL_EMU1010B},\n\nSave this file, and close. \n3. Compile and install\nGo to each of the folders where you extracted driver* (skip if version of Ubuntu is 13.10+), firmware, lib, and utils, and for each of them run this command\n./configure && make && sudo make install\n\nDo the same for lib and utils.\n4. Copy the firmware files to emu folder\nGo to the folder where you extracted alsa-firmware in the terminal. Browse to the folder /emu/ there, and run the following command:\nsudo cp *fw /lib/firmware/emu\n\nNote:/lib/firmware/emu should exist, but if doesn't create it.\n5. Configure the Linux sound base to use ALSA\nRun this command:\nsudo dpkg-reconfigure linux-sound-base\n\nand choose ALSA.\n6. Reboot!\nThis should be all. Once the system boots up, you should see SB0400 Audigy2 Value Analog Stereo in the sound settings of Ubuntu.\n\nAfter you are done\nThis is enough for you to get started and get a sound output from your card. For more advanced ways to tweak the input/outputs of the cards see the following links:\nemutrix : matrix-style mixer for this card. This will need to be compiled with Qt. It's relatively straightforward to build with qt4 and slightly more tricky with Qt5. The compilation command is simply qmake && make.\n\nHere's how to compile this project with Qt5 (you can install Qt5 using sudo apt install qt5-default). Download and extract emutrix0.3.1 and open the file emutrix.pro with a text editor. After the line TEMPLATE = app, insert the following:\n greaterThan(QT_MAJOR_VERSION, 4): QT += widgets gui\n\nThen save this file, and at the root of the project run the command \n qmake\n\nNext, open a text editor and open the file emutrix0.3.1/src/main.cc. At the top, delete the line #include <QtGui/QApplication> and replace it with #include <QtWidgets/QApplication> \nThen open the file src/mainwindow.h and similarly delete the line #include <QtGui/QApplication> and this time replace it with \n#include <QtWidgets/QMainWindow>\n#include <QMainWindow>\n\nAnd save these two files. Now we can compile the project by running\nmake \n\nThis might take a while. Note that you can run make -j 4 for example to use 4 threads if you have a machine with more available threads so that it compiles faster. If you do run into issues during the compilation, do a quick Google search of the compile error, usually the first one or two hits will resolve it.\nOnce everything is compiled, we are ready to launch it with ./emutrix. You can further create a .desktop file in /usr/share/applications so that you can launch emutrix from the start menu.\n\nAdditional Audio Tools\nalsamixer: this is the main mixer that I often use to mute/adjust io levels. All you have to do to start it is to run in the terminal alsamixer.\ngnome-alsa-mixer : or the gui version of it if you prefer (sudo apt-get install gnome-alsa-mixer)\nqjackctl This is installed with sudo apt-get install jack qjackctl. Read more about jack on wiki. Some applications in Ubuntu may use this to have low latency and high resolution sound. \n\nA: I found that\nsudo apt-get install libncursesw5-dev gettext xmlto\nis necessary before building the alsa-utils.\n", "Q: My ubuntu partition was deleted and I can't boot from either a DVD or USB It's my first time installing ubuntu. I have Windows 7 and 8 before in my laptop (Acer Aspire 4752z). After Ubuntu (12.04) installed in my laptop, the Windows boot loader didn't recognize my Ubuntu so I updated grub from a live USB. \nAnd after grub updated, Ubuntu was booting perfectly but my Windows wasn't listed in the grub menu. So I follow someone instruction to update grub again. And after reboot, the grub menu didn't show anymore. \nAfter searching about this problem on the net and trying to update grub again and again, I decided to delete the Ubuntu partition from live USB. And shortly after, I booted to Windows with Hiren boot and I used mbrfix. But i think it failed. Now i cant show my BIOS setup or boot from DVD or USB. \nAfter that, the only screen i can see after booting is:\nerror: unknown filesystem\ngrub rescue>\n\n\nA: The code that fits in the Drive MBR is very small. In the case of Windows, the bootloader is very simple and merely redirects to the bootsector of the partition with the boot flag set. Grub is a more complicated bootloader, but it's still limited by the space, so it has to load modules from a specific partition (the Ubuntu partition you deleted).\nWhen Grub cannot find those modules (because the partition no longer exists), then you get a very limited grub rescue prompt. It can be used to load grub modules manually, but of course in your case, that's not possible because there is no partition. So there is really nothing you can do (that I am aware of) that will boot the remaining operating system (Windows).\nIn your case, the simplest way to fix it is to replace the Grub bootloader with a Windows bootloader. You mentioned you have problems booting from DVD and USB, in which case you'll have to figure that out or consider removing your drive to another machine. I think it's pretty unusual for a machine to no longer boot from USB or CD/DVD so I'd try troubleshooting that.\nThen you can install the Windows bootloader from a Windows repair prompt (either by booting a Windows repair CD or a Windows Installation DVD) and running:\nbootrec /fixmbr\n\nOr you could boot an Ubuntu CD and install a bootloader with equivalent function...\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get install lilo\nsudo lilo -M /dev/sda mbr\n\nLilo will give you a big warning after it's installed - but you can ignore that as when it is used as a Windows style bootloader, it works fine as written above.\n", "Q: Ubuntu Server does not appear on network by NetBIOS name until 2nd reboot? Currently having a strange issue whereby my Ubuntu LTS 10.04 Server does not appear on the network on first boot after being shut down.  I am able to connect to the server using the assigned IP, but not via the NetBIOS name.\nI am using sudo shutdown -h now to perform a safe shutdown and power off the system.\nCurrently, I have tried to troubleshoot the problem by restarting the samba service and restarting networking but neither of these attempts allow the server to be seen on the network.\nThe only thing that seems to fix the problem is if I restart the server after it boots successfully for the first time.\nAny help would be appreciated.  I'm at a total loss here.\n\nA: Hm, I think something you installed might be causing this. What programs do you have installed that are not stock with ubuntu server? You might also want to try \"shutdown -s now\" to shutdown, which might fix it.

The affected part of the screen remains as it was when the window was open, and it stays on top of other windows. It's not a redraw issue per se -- xrefresh doesn't help since it repaints the bad window.\nThis phantom window does not appear in the 'task bar' or Alt+Tab switcher, but it's not just a screen artifact either. When I run my mouse over it the cursor changes, so it's still being treated in some ways like a window (though it can't be selected or changed and it doesn't have a full titlebar).\nAny ideas how I can change this? This problem happens, unfortunately, with some regularity to me, maybe every other week. As I leave my computer on for extended periods to do extended calculations this is more than a small inconvenience, since it blocks part of the display for several weeks until the work is complete and I can restart.\n\nA: I found the answer, which I record here for others who may have the same issue.\nFirst I used xprop to find what window was causing the problem. (xkill was ineffective here.) It turned out to be gtk-window-decorator.\nThen I killed it by its pid (given by xprop or ps). Finally, I restarted it (using Alt + F2 so it would not be bound to the terminal) to get the title bars and other decorations.\n\nA: Best thing to so is run the \"ps -A\" command to see the processes that are running. Make sure you are not running any critical programs and exit as many programs as possible as that will show less processes in the \"ps -A\" command.\nThen you proceed to kill each of the processes one at a time until the phantom windows disappears. Take a note of the programs before you kill them. This is incase you kill a process that scrambles you computer (memory, you can always reboot). Which means you restart and start again next time the window appears.\nIt's an iterative process but will help you to fault find.\nOnce you find the offending program remove it or set its attribute so it cannot execute.\nAlso google the processes that you see which gives you an idea of what is normal process and ones that you find no reference to which might be the culprit.\n", "Q: Can't change ethernet card's IP address I have Ubuntu 12.10 desktop version installed on HP 4000 PC, when I try to set up static IP address for NIC by using Network from menu bar, and switch from DHCP to manual, I can add static IP, default gateway and network mask.

The Windows 7 drive is almost full and I was wondering how can I extend my Win7 drive using Ubuntu? So that I have 2 Drives using Windows 7 and 1 drive using Ubuntu.\n\nA: I recommend moving your personal folders and, if applicable, your music files to the new drive.  Format it with 4096K cluster sizes for best performance and go with NTFS.\nfor me, it's my downloads, music and video folders that are huge.  I run SSD's for my operating system, and redirect all downloads to the HDD, which is also where I store my music (I added music, downloads, and a video folder to my libraries).\nUbuntu doesn't seem to have a problem working with NTFS, and FAT32 is just bad.\nGood luck!\n\nA: Don't extend, use GParted to format the unallocated space on the third drive as a NTFS partition. This will enable Windows to see it. You can also use it in Linux as it pops up in the file manager as a volume you can mount.\nI use ENCFS to create a directory on the NTFS partition to create a folder that will be encrypted so you can pump your Linux data onto it as well.

A puppet node (running the puppet agent) is hooked up to a puppet master, and receives a catalogue of resources and services that should be made available on the puppet node. It does not provide an out of the box facility to monitor all running processes on puppet nodes.\nThat said, once each node has finished running through the catalogue of resources provided by the puppet master, it logs the state of each resource (including any errors), and posts this log back to the puppet master for later analysis. A separate puppet application (the Puppet Dashboard) can analyse these logs to produce a web-accessible console of the state of your entire puppet-managed environment, which is very useful. That may give you an approximation of the functionality you are asking about.\nThis article on installing Puppet Dashboard should get you going.\n", "Q: What happens to the USB after burning Ubuntu 12.04?

Can someone help me?\n\n\nA: Normally you would edit the file /etc/default/grub, but since you can't run the necessary sudo update grub afterwards in windows, I suggest you change that option temporary before starting Ubuntu in GRUB.\nIn GRUB (hold shift while booting if it doesn't show up) you can edit the start command line and add nosplash nomodeset. You have to select the Ubuntu (Kernel..) you want to start (usually the first entry in that menu) and then press \"e\", that will allow you to add your parameters.\nThat won't survive a reboot though, that's why if it is successful you should edit the file I mentioned above and run the update command.\n", "Q: How to change default file/folder permission of specific user?

It can still serve the cached content but won't retrieve any newer packages over the Internet. \n\nA: I realise this is an old question, but here is the way I solve this problem.\nYou can specify version numbers when you call call apt-get install, you do so like this:\napt-get install apache2=2.2.20-1ubuntu1\n\nwhich will install version 2.2.20-1ubuntu1 of apache2. So when you set up the development server, make sure you specify the latest version number, which will give you the same result as simply apt-get install x. But then when you move to production, specify the same version number (which will be stored in you ap-cacher-ng server) to install that exact version, regardless of whether new versions have been released.\nSee this question for more details.\n\nA: Just create a preference configuration dev-dep-pin.conf in /etc/apt/preferences.d to pin down only the dependency package whose version matters (or there is no point to auto-update, right?) on both prod and dev server. You can use the policy conditions wisely to create pinning scheme that works best.\nscp/rsync that file between dev and prod server before you need to sync packages between production and dev servers via apt-update/apt-upgrade/apt-install.\nThis way, you let production server auto-update system packages freely, meanwhile maintaining versions of important package in the dependency tree configured exactly the same as the dev server.\nSpecifying the version during installation can't guarantee the package won't change in future updates/installations(as dependent of other package). Pinning is to make it persistent.\n", "Q: SSH bootstrap nodes After a successful juju bootstrap, still to figure out how to ssh the nodes.\nThe reason for this is because the juju status command shows that agent-state is not started in two nodes also with instance-state: unknown!!!\nIt seems that integration of the juju zookeeper  can't be established.\nDisabling the firewall is also another alternative as was proposed in askubuntu \nJuju stuck in \"pending\" state when using LXC\nlooking for a way to SSH to the bootstrap node and dig around in /var/log/zookeeper to figure out the missing part.\nBasically, an alternative to do so is to play with file:\n/var/lib/cobbler/kickstart/maas.preseed\nand change line :\n\nd-i     passwd/user-password-crypted password !\n\nwith :\n\nd-i     passwd/user-password-crypted    password encrypted_password\n\nThen, bootstrap the machine and login with ubuntu/password [set in the conf file]\nThe question is that the last file does not exist in maas and juju installation.

I've run the following below and noticed that I only have one motd file instead of having a secondary file called motd.tail that most Ubuntu versions seem to have. Should I create backup copy the motd file and then write to that file, or write to the file directly? Also, once I've written to this file do I need to make it executable to display the message?\nls -l motd* // output: motd -> /var/run/motd\n\n\nA: As you've seen, /etc/motd is a symlink to /var/run/motd.\n/var/run/motd is updated by a series of scripts that you'll find in the /etc/update-motd.d directory. The last of those scripts, 99-footer prints the contents of /etc/motd.tail, if it exists, and the output of 99-footer is appended to /var/run/motd.\nA comment in /etc/update-motd.d/99-footer says:\n# motd.tail is reserved for the admin to append static\n# trailing information to a dynamically generated\n# /etc/motd.\n#\n# To add dynamic information, add a numbered\n# script to /etc/update-motd.d/\n\nSo /etc/motd.tail is the usual way to append static content to /etc/motd.\nOf course, if you prefer, you can change all that, for example by making /etc/motd a standalone file with whatever contents you like. But then you'd lose the useful information added by the existing scripts.\nAnd no, you don't need to make either motd or motd.tail executable, since they're not meant to be executed.\n\nA: Oviously not 100% ubuntu, but I guess the handling is not that much different.\n/etc/motd is just a symbolic link to var/run/motd which in turn on system startup gets filled with the contents of /etc/mod.tail.\nSo it's just the file /etc/motd.tail you'd have to fill with your message, while leaving everything else intact if you don't want to break this scheme.\nHere's the output of man motd on debian. I guess it's the same for ubuntu, but better check yourself.\n\nDESCRIPTION\n   The  contents  of  /etc/motd  are displayed by login(1) after a successful\n   login but just before it executes the login shell.\n\n   The abbreviation \"motd\" stands for \"message of the day\", and this file has\n   been traditionally used for exactly that (it requires much less disk space\n   than mail to all users).\n\n   On Debian GNU/Linux this file is a symbolic  link  pointing  to  /var/run.\n   The  contents of this file are regenerated upon every system boot based on\n   the contents of /etc/motd.tail.\n\nFILES\n         /etc/motd\n         /etc/motd.tail\n\n... and don't forget to make sure the pam_motd module get's run during login.

Does not exist anymore in Ubuntu 16.04 LTS, not even as a symbolic link to /var/run/motd. If it is created, however its contents will be printed too.\n\n*/var/run/motd – This was used by Ubuntu’s first implementation. It is not used anymore. It is just ignored by PAM.\n\n*/var/run/motd.dynamic – This is what is shown on login currently. It is updated by /etc/init.d/motd at every boot. It is also updated by PAM by running the scripts in /etc/update-motd.d/, if they exist.\n\n*/etc/motd.tail – The Ubuntu package used to populate /etc/update-motd.d. One of them would cat the contents of this file so it was easy to add static content. That script does not exist in the package anymore, so the file does not have the intended effect.\n\n\nUpdated info here\nhttps://ownyourbits.com/2017/04/05/customize-your-motd-login-message-in-debian-and-ubuntu/\n", "Q: How can I recover from chmod -R a-wrx / command? Today I ran sudo chmod -R a-wrx /. Now nothing is working. Can anyone help me recover my system?\n\nA: Basic answer\nIf you are comfortable with scripting you could:\n\n*\n\n*do a clean install on another machine.\n\n*use a script to extract the entire file directory and annotate it automatically with all its permissions (for instance, /usr/bin/sh 0755 [I am just making something up here])\n\n*use that list to apply the same permissions on your messed up installation.\n\nOr of course a clean install is possible.\nBTW: Who told you to issue that command?\nMore Information (edit)\nI actually just found a really nice script that uses the same logic. As the author says, be careful before using it and don't if you are not sure you know what it does: https://superuser.com/questions/132891/how-to-reset-folder-permissions-to-their-default-in-ubuntu-9-10\nTo help you on the way (from the source mentioned above):\nfind /etc /usr /bin -exec stat --format \"chmod %a ${MPOINT}%n\" {} \\; > /tmp/restoreperms.sh\n\n\nA: I would almost say that you might have to do a clean re-install here.  There are many iterations of directories off of the system root that are required for Ubuntu (Linux) to run properly.  If their permissions are messed-up, you will need to re-chmod everything.  That's assuming of course that it even lets you log back in.\nIf you wanted to try to recover, you may be able to accomplish this as the root user.  To get in as root, reboot and hold SHIFT immediately after BIOS posts.  That should get you into your GRUB menu.\nFrom the GRUB menu, select your most recent kernel tagged with \"(recovery mode).\"  Once that finishes loading, you should be presented with a menu that has an option to \"drop to root shell prompt.\"\nIf it works and logs you in as root, you should be able to chmod your system back into working order.\n", "Q: How to export/save Evolution contacts as separate .vcf files?

When I open Brasero I have no \"menu\" to choose blanking from.\nThe data on the disk that I want  to blank has some backup from Windows 7 is that why Brasero will not blank it? I no longer have Windows 7, Ubuntu is my only OS.\nI want to put Linux Mint on this DVD.\n\nA: I am the developer of libburn which probably does the drive\nrelated stuff for your Brasero.\nIn order to distinguish between a problem of Brasero's own\ncode and a problem of libburn, you could use one of my\ncommand line applications of libburn called xorriso. This can be installed with\nsudo apt-get install xorriso\n\nas it does not automatically get installed with libburn4 on Ubuntu.\nA blank command would be (I assume your drive has address /dev/sr0):\nxorriso -outdev /dev/sr0 -blank as_needed \n\nThen obtain the state of drive and medium:\nxorriso -outdev /dev/sr0 -toc\n\nIn case of success, xorriso should then report among other lines\nMedia status: is blank\n\nIf this succeeds, then Brasero's code is to blame, resp. the\nsystem facilities by which it gets information about drive and\nmedium.

I think the actual problem is that you are running the os on an external drive (via USB [2.0]?). This probably slows the processing down.\nIf you want to use both Ubuntu and Windows you could inform yourself about dual boot (if you want to use Windows for gaming) and VirtualBox (if you want to use Windows for general tasks like Microsoft Office).\n", "Q: Booting multiple Ubuntu's in a system I having Ubuntu 11.10, Windows7 and Windows8 installed for now.\nI also want to install UbuntuStudio.\nI have tried installing it into a separate partition. \nBut, that did not load. \nOnly the Ubuntu 11.10(with WindowsLoader[windows7 & windows8]) loads.\nThe newly installed UbuntuStudio(based on Ubuntu 12.04) doesn't load up. The installation went successful.\nHow am I supposed to load that also?\n\nA: Run sudo update-grub in Ubuntu and it should find and add ubuntustudio to the menu.\nAlso 11.10 reaches end of life in a few weeks, so you should upgrade.\n\nA: That depends on how many (primary) partitions you already have.\nAFAIK only 4 primary partitions or 3 primary partitions and 1 extended partition, which can be subdivided into multiple logical partitions, are possible to be created on any hard drive. Many operating systems need to be running on an active primary partition to be bootable.\nSo if you already have 3 operating systems (probably on 3 primary partitions) and maybe one SWAP or data partition, you cannot create an additional primary partition (see Wikipedia for more information).\n\nNevertheless you actually don't need to seperately install Ubuntu Studio, as all the additional packages are available though the official packet sources. You can find a list of the packages here.\n", "Q: Is there a Trash explorer to explore and restore .Trash-$uid contents? I work with external storage and mounts a lot, and I often end up with a .Trash directory somewhere, whose contents are not shown in the File Manager trash bin, even though .Trash/files contains a lot of files.\nThe whole hierarchy in .Trash/files is changed compared to the original parent directory, and a lot of files appear to have duplicates. So I can't just mv the contents back to the original directory. I was wondering if there is some kind of 'Trash Explorer' that lets you see the trash for specific trash directories in it's original hierarchy and lets you restore portions as such.\nThis time, a memory drive that Ubuntu One was using, stopped working. The mount-bind was suddenly empty. Ubuntu One proceeded to delete gigabytes of thousands of files on all my computers that shared this directory, luckily putting all the files in a .Trash directory locally.\nI say again, Nautilus/Nemo does not show this trash, and neither does trash-list, yet it is filed with files, info and files.u1conflict courtesy of Ubuntu One.\n\nA: It seems that Trash-bin dos NOT work right with Bind-Mounts! \nBut if the files are there Unhide them and you can drag them out where they belong (after chmod -R g+rwx) with Nautilus or another Gui-filemanager.\nThen you have to delete the rest of the files from the terminal.\nHope this works for you.\n", "Q: How to get 12.10 fix for PDF Printing Problem (where some pages print blank) in 12.04? As documented on Launchpad, there is a bug for Ubuntu 12.04 somewhere in the PDF printing stack.  This bug causes some or all pages of the PDF to print blank.  Since this issue doesn't occur in Ubuntu 12.10, it seems no one is interested in fixing the issue on Ubuntu 12.04.\nThis is a serious issue for me.  My job requires me to print many PDFs sent to me by other people, some of which are effected by this bug (none of the PDFs I create in Ubuntu are effected by this issue).  My current workaround is to open every single file in Adobe's PDF Reader in Windows and print them to...wait for it...PDF.  Other than being a huge waste of time, I extremely dislike having to use these two pieces of proprietary software to avoid this bug.\n\nHow can I get the fix in Ubuntu 12.10 for this bug in Ubuntu 12.04?\n\n\nA: Unfortunately I do not understand what the question actually is.\nI am using the Cups PDF package (which you can install via sudo apt-get install cups-pdf), which adds a new PDF printer to your printer list and automatically saves all documents printed with it to /home/<user>/PDF/.\nI have not noticed any bug like the one you described with this, also running Ubuntu 12.04. If you are not using this way it might be a simple solution.\n\nA: I have faced this problem with certain PDF files. Evince only prints the first few pages of such a PDF.\nThe workaround solution I use is to open the PDF with an alternate PDF viewer which uses a different printing backend. I use Okular for this purpose. I print to file from Okular and then open this new file using Evince. Printing this seems to work fine.\n", "Q: How can i fix port conflicts between apache tomcat (8080) and default http (8080)?

By default, Tomcat's comes configured to run an\n  HTTP server on port 8080.  If you examine the supplied server.xml\n  file, you'll see the following element:\n\n <!-- Normal HTTP -->\n <Connector className=\"org.apache.tomcat.service.PoolTcpConnector\">\n    <Parameter name=\"handler\" \n         value=\"org.apache.tomcat.service.http.HttpConnectionHandler\"/>\n     <Parameter name=\"port\" \n         value=\"8080\"/>\n </Connector>\n\nYou should be able to alter that port number to have Tomcat run on a different port for HTTP.

It appears that multiple local users can log in from 2 or more stations without any issues. However,  when using active directory credentials logging in to the second workstation breaks the connection to the domain controller. Apparently there are some files being shared and clobbered. There are some sockets in /var/lib/pbis that I imagine are critical.

From what I remember, each machine is joined to the domain by an account with appropriate credentials. During the join process, an account (not really any different from user accounts) is created for the machine, complete with a password that must be changed periodically (30days is the default, I think.). [This account is saved in the pbis registry (somewhere under /var/lib/pbis) and is supposed to only be accessible by root.] So if two machines try to use the same account, they will also need to make sure to stay in sync with this password.\nThe sockets in /var/lib/pbis are important. For instance, the pam_lsass library (loaded by anything using PAM, like sshd), will access the socket in /var/lib/pbis to communicate with the lsass service, which is a service that will talk to the DC.\nI believe /var is supposed to be unique to each machine.\n", "Q: Installing NVIDIA geforce 9 driver using the installer I got from their website In my ubuntu 12.10 it didn't detect my graphic card.

In Ubuntu I have a couple of files in my Download folder which I can't drag into this folder. I get \"Error while copying to Ubuntu_Data. The destination is read only. I've tried chmod on this folder and I can't get it to work.\n\nA: (1) For this, it seems a simple sudo avgscan ~ will suffice. If you are not familiar with sudo, try man sudo. It temporarily elevates the user to root privileges. man will fetch the manual page for a command. It is very useful to read these pages to understand how commands can be used and what they do.\n(2) What exactly did you do with chmod? Remember the following: if using chmod ### the first number is for owner, the second for other users in the file's group, and the fourth for users not in the file's group.\nEach number functions as follows:4 for read, 2 for write, and 1 for execution rights. So chmod 777 /media/Ubuntu_Data gives you everything. This isn't good practice unless you have a reason for it.\nAlso, ls -l /media/Ubuntu_Data will tell you the permissions currently set. At the end of the day, chmod 775 /media/Ubuntu_Data will give you write permissions on your folder without giving everyone in the world write. Give that a shot.\nAnd please, for future question purposes, include as much info as you can, e.g. how you used the chmod command. \"I've tried chmod on this folder and I can't get it to work.\" does not tell us a tremendous amount about what you did.\n", "Q: Unity is gone after uninstalling webapps?

So no need to get into the machine to make such configurations.\nI wonder if this charm would be useful for the community?\nThanks!\nEdit - I already know the jenkins charm, but it just install jenkins and nothing more than that. So our needs were to automatize all the environment configuration without enter in machine to make the enviroment.\nBased on charm Jenkins we modified to pull a repository named builder from github and there you can put a  bash script to install dependencies that the charm runs and a config.xml with the jenkins job that will be created. \nFor our projects this facilitates the jenkins configuration so we can just change few parameters to deploy it. We already try to use this function to install scripts but we had some problems with that and using a repository you are able to change somethings without having to deploy a charm in any alteration.    \n\nA: There is already a Jenkins charm in the Juju Charm Store. I'm not sure I completely grasp what you're trying to do though. The README for the charm outlines how to add custom install scripts which I think may be along the lines of what you're referring to.\n", "Q: Bumblebee not working anymore after installing the new nvdia drivers I had managed to make bumblebee work yesterday and today i launch update manager and i see some new nvidia drivers.

In short: is there (under Unity) any way to find out which application grabbed some global shortcut? I do not ask for \"standard shortcuts\" but for some way to get information about actual shortcuts (which app is actually keeping given key just now in my current config)\nLonger story:\nI have repeatable problems with managing keyboard shortcuts. At the moment:\n\n\n*\n\n*Synapse sometimes (*) can't bind Win-Space as it's activation shortcut, reporting \"Failed to register hotkey 'activate' with signature 'space'\" (what usually means that this shortcut is already taken)\n(*) After one login it works, after another login it does not. I suspect some race between two apps…\n\n*F9 for some reason makes my screen slightly darker (and F9 does not reach application-level shortcuts so for example my byobu menu does not work)\nI tried looking at various places, and:\n\n\n*\n\n*I do not see any of those shortcuts in Keyboard settings/Shortcuts\n\n*I can't find them in gconf-editor (I tried searching for F9 in values in particular, nothing found)\n\n*I could not find them in dconf-editor (there is no search so I clicked some most obvious paths)\nSo my question is: is there any way to ask unity/dconf/gconf/d-bus/whatever about current global hotkeys allocation (which process is keeping which key). Or force logging those allocations to some log file. Or grep them from somewhere.

(but who uses there any more anyway?)  :-)\n\nA: From one of my older answers:\nFirst you have to install xdotool:\nsudo apt-get install xdotool\n\nI made up a series of commands to show us the passive grabs on a keystroke. For example to see what is grabbing the Shift+PrintScreen combo, you can use the below \"script\":\nxdotool keydown \"shift+Print\"; xdotool key \"XF86LogGrabInfo\"; xdotool keyup \"Print\"; sleep 1; xdotool keyup \"shift\"; tail /var/log/Xorg.0.log\n\nThis will trigger Shift+PrtSc keyevent and on a default Ubuntu install will show gnome-settings-daemon grabbing the keyboard. At least this worked on my older 12.04 install, but looks like on a 14.04 I had to use this:\nxdotool key \"shift+Print\"; sleep 1; xdotool key \"XF86LogGrabInfo\"; xdotool keyup \"Print\"; sleep 1; xdotool keyup \"shift\"; tail /var/log/Xorg.0.log\n\nbut\nxdotool keydown \"F12\"; xdotool key \"XF86LogGrabInfo\"; xdotool keyup \"F12\"; tail /var/log/Xorg.0.log\n\nstill works, sometimes, and not other times. Don't know why.\nYou just have to modify the above \"script\" by changing the keys which have to be simulated.\n", "Q: Why can a new user not write to external Hard Drive? I installed Precise Pangolin using this guide. I created a user account for my wife and a guest account. I formatted and mounted an external hard drive to the server. I created several file shares using Webmin as per the guide.\nAll file shares are set to writable; with valid users: myself and wife (some also have guest as valid user). I was initially unable to write to any share with any account. I ran chown -R /directory/to/myshare (using the correct directory path of course) and was able to write to the specific share with my account.\nI set file permissions to 775 (in webmin) and am still unable to write using wife account. Accounts are under group: Users.\nWhat else can I try to allow wife account to write?\n\nA: This sounds like a groups problem. Certain groups are allowed to do certain things. If your not in the club you don't get to play.

I am dual booting ubuntu along side of Windows 7, in which ubuntu is dedicated 22 GB and Windows is dedicated the rest. So like the normal startup, you select either Ubuntu or 7 and the OS's boot is launched from there. However, within the last couple of days, when I select Ubuntu to boot with, it opens a GRUB menu. Here are the commands I've tried to enter in sequence, which was unsuccessful.\ngrub>ls\ngrub>set root=(hd0,msdos3)\ngrub>linux /vmlinuz ro root=/dev/sda1\n   \"File /vmlinuz not found.\"\ngrub>Initrd /initrd.img\n     \"You must load the kernel first.\"\ngrub>boot\n    \"You must load the kernel first.\"\n\nI obtained this list of commands from an outside website, and honestly haven't really ever used grub before, so I don't really know what I'm doing. Especially considering I'm not quite familiar with Linux yet. So please try to dumb it down for me if you can.\nSo basically two questions come up: What happened to /vmlinuz and how do I load the kernel?\nThank you in advance.\n\nA: You need to know which partition you installed on. In those instructions you listed, you're setting root to /dev/sda3 to load the kernel, and then saying that root is /dev/sda1. Which is normally used if you have a separate boot partition on /dev/sda3 with / (root) on /dev/sda1 - either that or you're entering instructions from the website without understanding how they apply to your setup - because this isn't a normal setup.\nThat first menu you see - are you sure it's a Grub menu or is this in fact a Wubi install and it's really a Windows Boot Manager screen. i.e. did you install from within windows? (because that matters).\nIf it's a Windows boot manager, then you need to check this out: Ubuntu 12.04 (Wubi) not starting - root.disk corrupted\nThis answer was too long for comments (even though I'm asking for clarification), but you should edit your question with more information and the comment when you're done.

I don't remember I had this hard time even when building my Hackintoshes.\nSo, now I'm at the point where I tried everything I found - Unetbootin, Startup disk creator, Live USB creator - nothing really works, as it doesn't detect the USB as a CD-ROM. I tried the switch cdrom-detect/try-usb=true to no avail. At least now I managed to get over this problem with the following method. I make the USB boot disk, I copy the *.iso to the USB too, I boot the installer and when I get the CD-ROM error, I ALT+F2 and do the following:\nmkdir /usb\nmount -t vfat /dev/sdb1 /usb\nls /usb (so I see the name of the ISO clearly)\nmount -t iso9660 -o loop /usb/whatever-the-iso-is-called.iso /cdrom\nls /cdrom (so I see it has mounted the ISO right)\n\nSo mounting the ISO in a word. I select \"Load configuration from CD-ROM\" or something like that and I got rid of the CD-rom error. Everything's peachy until I get to the Configure APT screen, where it can't connect to the internet because I'm behind a firewall and it doesn't give me the choice to enter the proxy and it just quits to the installation choices screen. Now if I tell the installer to let me configure what software I want installed, it just tries to configure apt, it fails and it quits to the choices screen. Then I can continue the installation with install grub, it installs it and it works after restart.\nBUT i have absolutely nothing installed, not even nano, my sources.list is empty with only the CD-ROM resources line. I don't know what to do... I need LAMP, SMB, SSL, CUPS installed - I don't want to do everything manually. Has anyone succeeded doing a start to finish installation using USB? If yes, how? BTW, everything works OK if you install from the CD (even if I plug the LAN cable out, it still configures apt and it still populates the sources.list). But I don't have a CD drive on the system I want to do the final install too and I don't want to buy any external CD drive just to get this done. All help welcome, I'm going crazy with this...\n\nA: So I managed to do it, I'll write it down, maybe others confronting this problem will make use of it.\nWhen you get to the point where because of the enterprise firewall the installer can't configure APT, just select the next step - Install GRUB and finish installation. Now you can boot in a bare bone ubuntu server. Leave the USB connected, reboot and login to the new server. Mount the *.iso again as your sources.list will contain only the ubuntu server CDROM as repo. Now, when that's done:\nsudo apt-get install nano tasksel\nsudo tasksel --list-tasks\nsudo tasksel install what-ever-you-want-from-list\n\nNow on with configuring the proxy:\nsudo nano /etc/environment\n\nand configure proxy there:\nex. http_proxy=\"http://192.168.X.X:PORT/\"\n\nThen go to http://repogen.simplylinux.ch and generate your sources.list, paste it through SSH or somehow, then:\nsudo apt-get update\n\nYou're done.\nEDIT: btw, I tried the USB install from home, without proxy and my experience is that the installer still fails to configure APT and System Clock. So you have to do the after-boot CD mounting anyway if installing from USB. Interestingly, using a normal CD works fine.\n\nA: I have had similar problems with installs from USB devices and it not being able to mount the cd-rom (iso).\nThese two steps can quickly solve this issue:\n\n\n*\n\n*check your BIOS boot order settings and move your USB device to the top of the list.\n\n*you may still get the same error message about being unable to mount the cd-rom, simply unplug the usb device and re-insert it then choose the option to retry detecting the cd-rom.\n9 times out of ten it will now recognise the iso on the usb and begin the installation.\nnote if this does not work try restarting with the usb drive in a different usb slot and try them all one by one.\n", "Q: My NTFS and ext4 partition mounts as read only After upgrading some packets (that I don't know what), my ext4 partitions are mounted as read only:\nm@mpc ~ $ sudo mount /dev/sda5 /mnt\nmount: warning: /mnt seems to be mounted read-only.\n\nMy NTFS partitions are mounted as read only too and when I want to use fsck it says:\nm@mpc ~ $ sudo fsck /dev/sda5 \n[sudo] password for m: \nfsck from util-linux 2.20.1\nfsck: fsck.ntfs: not found\nfsck: error 2 while executing fsck.ntfs for /dev/sda5\n\nHow can I solve this problem?\nEdit: ext partitions are now ok, but still problem with NTFS.\n\nA: From the output of fsck, I can see you are using the Kernel NTFS driver which is a read-only driver.\nYou need to install (perhaps reinstall) the FUSE NTFS driver called NTFS 3G. The following command should solve your problem:\nsudo apt-get install ntfs-3g\n\nAfter that, either reboot or unmount and remount your NTFS partition. It should be mounted as read write. If it is not the case try forcing the type of file system with the following command:\nsudo mount -t ntfs-3g /dev/sda5 /mnt\n\nNOTE: AFAIK there are no fsck tool for NTFS partitions on Linux.\n\nA: For my ext partition I used fsck and for my NTFS partitions I used a tool in ntfs-3g named ntfsfix.

Take care that you doesn't toggle the format option to \"on\" in the partitioning dialog.\nThat aside, my advice is that you start from scratch and re-partition your disk.\nIMHO, you will need a bigger /usr/ partition than you did with 10.10.\nAlso, you can upgrade from the ext3 filsystem to ext4, and perhaps you could even consider migrating to LVM.\n\nA: While it would be preferable to make a backup of your data, you should simply be able to \"reinstall\" Ubuntu (that should be an option on the live USB); it will keep all the programs it can and it should not touch your documents (ie /home/).\nHowever, I've only tried this when upgrading newer releases to the newest and while it should work with 10.10, I strongly encourage you to backup your data.

But with new Lubuntu kernel, now I get the error message, and wont get away.\nVMware Kernel Module Updater, before you can run VMWare, several modules must be compiled and loaded into the running kernel\n\n6) I noticed that the patch I download has 2 files:\na) patch-modules_3.2.0.sh\nb) vmware-715-kernel32.patch\nI am able to run patch-modules_3.2.0.sh properly, and I am able to install it succesfully, but I dont know how to install or run vmware-715-kernel32.patch.\nI getting the feeling that, this is why I am getting the errors message, because I havent install properly the vmware-715-kernel32.patch\nAny ideas of what command I need to run in the terminal in order to run vmware-715-kernel32.patch, and been able to patch the kernel succesfully ?\n\nA: Syntax for patch an application is :  \nsudo patch `which [APPLICATION]` [DIRECTORY]/[PATCH FILE.patch]\n\nIn your case :\nsudo patch `which vmware-player` [DIRECTORY]/vmware-715-kernel32.patch\n\n\nA: You might find the below command necessary to actually kick off the recompilations:\nsudo vmware-modconfig --console --install-all\n\n(after patching of course)\n", "Q: Installing windows 7 after a kubuntu install? I have a kubuntu 12.10 installation that I use as a primary work machine.  This is a single installation (2 partition OS / Swap).  \nI need to install windows7 and the majority of tutorials (all) assume that windows is installed first.\nIs it possible to use the kde partition manager to shrink the kubuntu partition, add the two required windows partitions and install a 'working' windows7 install?\nDo any tutorials exists as I imagine this might be messy...\n\nA: Basically, to shrink your partition you'll need a LiveUSB boot to do that, because otherwise those partitions would be mounted and in-use (locked).\nAfter you've shrunken your partition, and set-up a new one for Windows (do it carefully as shuffling/resizing partitions after an install is just a pain and can get risky), you can install Windows safely without losing your Kubuntu setup.\nJust make sure you don't let the Windows installer overwrite/format/delete any of your Kubuntu partitions in the process.\nAfter Windows is installed, the MBR of your hard-disk will be overwritten, thus deleting Grub. And you won't be able to boot into Kubuntu. This can easily be fixed though, through yet again a LiveUSB boot.\nYou can check out this guide to find out instructions to restoring Grub.\nAs always, read up instructions before doing anything. If you're not sure about something, Google for step-by-step instructions, read it, then ask new questions :)\n", "Q: Ubuntu 12.10: black screen after installing nvidia-current COMPUTER: Macbook pro 7'1 (mid 2010)\nGRAPHIC CARD: NVIDIA 320M\nToday, after a fresh install of Ubuntu Quantal Quetzal, I installed the suggested nvidia drivers from terminal by running the following command:\nsudo apt-get install nvidia-current\n\nand then: \nsudo nvidia-xconfig\n\nBut when I rebooted, after chosing Ubuntu from the boot loader, the screen was black and there was nothing I could do...\nHow can I fix this?\n\nThank you roadrm for your helpful answer, but I still cannot boot into a usable system even editing the kernel and adding the nomodeset string :( I managed to boot the 3.5.0-17, but my default kernel is the 3.5.0-25 so this doesn't help... I should probably add to the informations that before installing the nvidia-current I also entered the following commands:\nsudo apt-get install Linux-source\n\nAnd\nsudo apt-get install linux-headers-generic\n\nIn order to give The correct headers for the driver :(\n\nA: It's a bit of a stab in the dark, but try this:\n\n\n*\n\n*Boot the system, hold left-shift to get the grub menu\n\n*Press \"e\" to edit the kernel command line, and add \"nomodeset\", see here for more details on how to do this.\n\n*This should hopefully bring you to a usable system, even if only in console mode.\n\n*Now for the fun part. I suspect you're running into a bug that causes kernel modules to fail building due to missing kernel headers (bug report is here). To install the kernel headers, do \nsudo apt-get install linux-headers linux-headers-3.5.0-25-generic\nReplace 3.5.0-25 by your running kernel version (use the uname -a command to see this).\n\n\n*\n\n*Once the new headers are installed, do sudo apt-get install nvidia-current.\n\n*Closely watch the console output. If you see a message like this:\nBuilding only for 3.5.0-17-generic\nBuilding for architecture x86_64\nModule build for the currently running kernel was skipped since the\nkernel source for this kernel does not seem to be installed.\nit means the module wasn't compiled due to lack of kernel headers. This will tell you the version of the headers your system is expecting.\n\n*Once you get the modules correctly built, reboot normally and things should hopefully work.\n", "Q: Netflix on Ubuntu Black screen I've installed Netflix-desktop using the sudo apt-add-repository ppa:ehoover/compholio  method.

The 'all' is showing me all directories, even hidden ones. \nDoes the /etc folder have a different property to it that others do not? \n\nA: You're probably just missing it in the list.

I don't have any flash drives, but the net-book already has Windows 7. If I install Wubi.exe, will I be able to get rid of Windows 7 and use the space that Windows 7 was in for Ubuntu? I still have more then enough space left to install Ubuntu, but for whats due tomorrow, I will not. I'm installing 12.4LTS. If you have any questions ask right away and I will answer because if I don't do this by tomorrow, my boss will probably kill me. I will be on this website until I get an answer that will help me.\n\nA: You can shrink Windows (using it's Disk Management console) and then install Wubi and use that to create partitions and then migrate the Wubi install over to the new partitions. It's a bit long winded, but it's definitely doable. After that, you could remove the remaining Windows if it's important to remove all traces. \nSee How to convert Wubi install into regular install?\n\nA: Wubi is a loop back \"hack\" if you will, this meaning that your Ubuntu will live on the Windows partition and when you boot, and tell it to boot to Ubuntu, it will tell the computer to look in the Windows partition for the Wubi install. Thus if you get rid of Windows you will also get rid of your loop back as it will no longer exist.\nI would recommend going and buying a flash drive or 2 (1gb or larger) as cheap as they are these days. San Disk work really well, I have had a problem booting off a few PNY drives though so you might want to avoid those.\nShort of that, you will be stuck using Wubi.\nBy the way, this is the best non-technical explanation I could come up with.\n\nA: Due to the way Wubi installs Ubuntu (within the Windows partition), I doubt you can delete Windows after installing Ubuntu.\nYour best bet is likely going to be running out to your nearest electronics store and picking up a cheap flash drive and just doing a clean install. Alternatively, you may be able to do a network install if you have another computer that can host the installer.\n", "Q: How do I run a .JAR file via the terminal Mispelled classname in manifest.txt file caused this error\nIm trying to run a java file outside of my IDE by exporting the .jar file to my documents folder and trying to display the text 'hello world'in the file on the terminal line.

Are these sensors in different locations on the motherboard?\n\nA: \nAMD Temp Information and Guide\nWe've had a few great threads recently where members contacted AMD and asked what temps they should be looking at, what the max temp was on, and what programs should be used and why. But this information is still scattered and not well defined in one place. It also doesn't quite explain when you should be looking at certain temps. Well I've made it my mission to insure that people are reading the right temps and have been trying my best to give all the information each time I respond without sounding like a broken record. So I decided to write this information thread and little guide to help you out there.\nWhat is \"Core Temp\" ?\n\"Core Temp\" is what AMD refers to as \"TCTL\" and is a non-physical temperature on an arbitrary scale measured in degrees. It does not represent an actual physical temperature like die or case temperature.\nWhat is \"CPU Temp\" ?\n\"CPU Temp\" is read by a sensor in the socket of the motherboard.\n  It is a physical temperature and therefore will be effected by ambient temps inside the case.\nWhy should I use \"Core Temp\" and when?\nAMD designed this equation to accurately read peak (45C+) and load temps. It has an equational offset to determine said temps which equalizes at 45C. Since it's designed for peak temps and is a non-physical temperature it cannot read idle temps or account for ambient temps correctly.\nSo what is \"CPU Temp\" good for then?\nAt peak temps this value is typically 7-10C higher (depending on motherboard) than the actual temp due to it being a physical sensor. At idle it's a little more accurate, but still not dead on, and besides idle temps do not matter near as much as load temps do.\nAMD says my chip has a [INSERT SPEC] Celsius limit, what value is this referring to? This limit seems kind of low, why?\nThis is referring to \"Core Temp\" of course.\nSo for example Phenom IIs have a recommended 62C \"Core Temp\" limit while not exceeding 60C for extended periods.\nIt has long been argued that the recommended limit is merely a larger safety net. There is a thermal shutdown in the chip at 90C and the silicone is rated for 97C+, so it seems plausable that we could indeed go higher, but this guide (and most in general) will simply nod and point you to the recommended limit for your chip.\nWhat programs read \"Core Temp\" ?\nAMD recommends the Core Temp program and AMD Overdrive for this reason.\nThe core section of HWMonitor also reads this value, but be careful as it also shows CPU Temp.\n\nFrom http://www.overclock.net/t/1128821/amd-temp-information-and-guide\n", "Q: changing a directory In terminal I want to change a directory to something with a # sign in it.  For example #filename.chat and can't seem to remember how to do this.  From the command line I think it is suppose to be cd /filename.chat/ but doesn't seem to work. \n\nA: Actually the best way to do this is to use the \\ escape character. The method that @Shauna suggests will work in this case but has limitations. For example if the filename has quotes in it what do you do? this?:\ncd \"some \"\"\"Movie Title\"\"\"\" \n\nNo, that would be silly. You would do this:\ncd some\\ \\\"Movie\\ Title\\\"\n\nThe next character after the escape \\ is not interpretted by the shell. This is what we want.\nThere are three methods of escaping character in bash.\n\n\n*\n\n*Double quotes\nLeast powerful method. Preserves literal value except for dollar sign, backticks, and backslash.(tldp.org)\n\n\n*\n\n*Single quotes\nMost powerful. Hides all special characters. \n\n\n*\n\n*Backslash\nSimilar to single quotes, but only hides one character at a time.\nA good resource for this is TLDP\n\nA: Just put quotes around it, like this:\ncd \"#filename.chat\"\n\nIf you lead with a /, then it's going to look for the file or folder in the root directory (just fyi).\n", "Q: Ubuntu 12.10 not suspending i'm having a problem with my Asus s400 with ubuntu 12.10 installed.

My system is a dual boot for both Ubuntu and Windows7.  Both operating systems are sharing the drive named \"Elements\".\nMy volume named \"Elements\" is a 1TB SATA NTFS hard drive that shows up twice in the side bar in nautilus.  One of the icons is functional and even has the convenient \"eject\" icon next to it.  Below is a picture of the left menu in Nautilus, with System Monitor->File Systems tab open on top of it.  Can someone advise me about how to get rid of this extra icon?  I think the problem is much more deep-rooted than just a GUI glitch on Nautilus' part.\n\nThe other icon does nothing but spit out the following error when I click on it (image below). This only happened AFTER I tried using Mount Manager to automate mounting the drive at start up. I've already uninstalled Mount Manager, and restarted, but the problem didn't go away.  The hard drive does mount automatically now, so I guess that's cool.  But now, every time I boot up now and open Nautilus, BOTH of these icons appear, one of which is fictitious and useless.\nAccording to the image above and the outputs of several other commands, it appears to be mounted at \n/\nIn which case, no matter where I am in Nautilus when I try to click on that icon, of course it will tell me that that drive is in use by another program... Nautilus.\nI'm afraid of trying to unmount this hard drive (sdb6) because of where it appears to be mounted.  I'm kind of a noob, and I have this gut feeling that tells me trying to unmount a drive at / will destroy my entire file system.  This fear was further strengthened by the output of \"$ fsck\" at the very bottom of this post.\nError immediately below when that 2nd \"Elements\" hard drive is clicked in Nautilus:\n\nUnable to mount Elements\n\nMount is denied because the NTFS volume is already exclusively opened.\nThe volume may be already mounted, or another software may use it which\ncould be identified for example by the help of the 'fuser' command.\n\nIt's odd to me that that error message above claims that it's an NTFS volume when everything else tell me that it's an ext4 volume.

All has been working well, installing things, rebooting it multiple times. But now I got back on it and restarted it and suddenly the mouse doesn't work. \nThe keyboard works fine, I can type. And I can even click the mouse. I just can't move it around at all on the touchpad, or even with a USB mouse.\nI've read a lot of different questions about this, but I haven't found any good answers. I've read that for some people the mouse activates after like a minute, so far mine hasn't been doing that. I also read about this problem being caused by the Video drivers in some way, and that would make sense, because I did download a driver for my video card before this happened. \nBut if that is the case, what do I do then? Thanks for the help!\n\nA: Just also had the mouse mostly stop working on 12.04 64-bit (could still click on app icons  to open them, but could not use mouse to drag them, resize, or do anything else with the mouse -- also could not click on \"settings\" icon -- BTW, not running Unity here -- sudo apt-get install gnome-panel instead).  Tried resetting the wireless mouse connection and tried new batteries. Didn't help. lsusb in terminal window showed \"Bus 008 Device 002: ID 046d:c50e Logitech, Inc. Cordless Mouse Receiver\" so looked ok.  What did fix the problem for me was unplugging the wireless mouse USB connector from the computer and plugging it in again.  Plugged it into a different USB port. Don't know if that mattered. Might give that a try.\n", "Q: How can I shorten the bash prompt's current path to one letter per directory?

This computer come with EFI instead of the traditional BIOS.\nWhen I bought it, I had 3 visible partitions. C (System) - with windows and programs; D (Data) - in blank, I store my personal data and movies; E (Recovery) - software from ASUS to recovery computer.\nSo, as I'm at a Master's Degree in Computer Science, I needed to install Ubuntu. I made a partition from Win 7, reserving around 35 GB for Ubuntu 12.04.\nIt went fine, and the install was sucessful. I rebooted and I could get into Ubuntu. \nThe boot showed 4 entries: 2 for Ubuntu, and one for Windows and one, for Windows Recover.\nWhen I tried to enter Windows 7,  \"Windows 7 (loader)\", I got this message:\nerror: Invalid EFI file path.\nPress any key to continue...\n\nThe one for recovery couldn't boot either.\nSo I get in Ubuntu again, and use repair-tool, which insert new entries on GRUB. Now I have 11 entries!\nOne of the new entries is called \"Windows UEFI loader\". The old entry \"Windows 7 (loader)\" continued to not work. This new one, \"Windows UEFI loader\", got me into Windows. And I stooped here.\nI want a single boot manager with just the two needed options.\nI think that this isn't perfect, but I don't know how to solve it.\nMore, if I'm on Windows 7 and I put it to hibernate, when I turn on the computer, I get a black screen and the message saying that it couldn't restaure the session. (I'm not sure about the exact words. - I was oblied to reboot and start the windows again.)\nAnd this is a major concern. I would like to solve this too.\nHere is the link after running the boot-repair:\n\n\n*\n\n*http://paste.ubuntu.com/5591789/\nThis one I made it today, with boot-repair and asking for Boot info summary:\n\n\n*\n\n*http://paste.ubuntu.com/5593329/\n\nA: The Boot Repair tool is increasingly making a hash of things by creating too many backup copies of too many boot loader files. There are numerous ways to solve this problem. Here's one of them:\n\n\n*\n\n*Back up your EFI System Partition (ESP), which is /dev/sda1 in your case and is mounted at /boot/efi. A file-based backup (using tar or cp, for example) should do fine. This will enable you to recover should things go badly.\n\n*Install my rEFInd boot manager. This is most easily done by installing the Debian package.\n\n*Reboot. rEFInd should appear and show you boot options for Ubuntu and Windows.\n\n*Test each of the rEFInd options in turn, taking note of the filename specified under each and what it does. (A few may lack such filenames. One with a Windows icon will probably be one of these, but it will probably launch GRUB.) Be sure you can boot both Linux and Windows from rEFInd.\n\n*In Linux, open a shell and change to the /boot/efi directory, which is the EFI System Partition (ESP), where boot loaders are stored.\n\n*Delete the boot loaders that didn't work when you tested them, or copy them into a backup location (say, /boot/efi/backups). Do likewise with duplicates -- if two boot loaders both launched GRUB, for instance, you can delete or move one of them.\n\n*Move the boot loader that actually launched Windows (if it was identified by filename in rEFInd's main menu) to /boot/efi/EFI/Microsoft/Boot/bootmgfw.efi. This is where it's supposed to belong. Boot Repair copied it to another filename, so you're just copying it back.\n\n*If you can boot Linux directly via a vmlinuz-3.5.0-23-generic entry, you can probably delete GRUB, or uncomment the dont_scan_files line in /boot/efi/EFI/refind/refind.conf and add grubx64.efi to its list.\n\n\nIf all goes well, you should now be booting via rEFInd, which should present you with a much smaller list of boot options. If there are still too many, you can try to track down the errant files and delete them, if you think that's appropriate, or use the dont_scan_files, dont_scan_dirs, or dont_scan_volumes options in /boot/efi/EFI/refind/refind.conf to keep the remaining items out of the boot list. Such \"blacklisting\" might be helpful to keep links from /vmlinuz to /boot/vmlinuz-3.5.0-23-generic out of the boot list, if your system has such a symbolic link.\nNote that rEFInd scans for boot loaders on every boot, so it will automatically pick up new kernels when you install them.\nIf you prefer to keep using GRUB, you can do something conceptually similar to my procedure, but you'll need to peruse the /boot/grub/grub.cfg file and cross-reference this to your notes on which boot loader entries work and which don't work to discover which files to delete. You'll then need to use update-grub to re-write your grub.cfg file. Your current grub.cfg file also has BIOS-mode entries for launching Windows, which are useless, and I'm not sure how to keep update-grub from picking them up, if indeed that's how they got in there.\nGood luck!\n\nA: Here You find links to GRUB/UEFI related probs. \nAs well it could be a badly implemented UEFI by the main board manufacturer which produces errors in combination with Linux. Also, there are specific tips for dealing with Win7 and 8, like defragment and switch fast-start off, before installing Linux, etc.\nCheck, if your Win7 is listed in /boot/efi/EFI/ and check out the chainloader section in GRUB2. All in all, not too complicated for experienced Linux users, but tough for Linux Newbies. Better, ask for help, because you need to do a lot of reading; this is no one button solution.\n\nA: You just need to edit your /boot/grub/grub.cfg to remove the useless entries.\nYou can use the gksudo gedit /boot/grub/grub.cfg command for this.\n", "Q: How do i add the wsgi_module to the apache2.conf file? I am running a 32bit version of apache/ubuntu.\nI need to edit the /etc/apache2/apache2.conf file.\nI can't seem to find where the module will fit or load.  \n\nA: I guess you installed it by running sudo apt-get install libapache2-mod-wsgi.\na2enmod is the command to enable apache modules, so you have to run:\nsudo a2enmod wsgi\n\nIf don't know the module name just run sudo a2enmod and it will show you which modules are enabled and which modules can be enable.\n", "Q: 'Appearance' icon not showing in 'System Settings' I am facing a very peculiar problem, the 'Appearance' icon in 'System settings' has disappeared and now I cannot change the background or control the unity. Any ideas how to get it back?\n\nA: Along with screen shot as lucio said, also explain your last activity what you remember that may affect appearance. Before that check in Ubuntu software center weather the \"appearance\" was ticked(installed) or not. You may have uninstalled appearance accidentally.\n\nA: This seems to be something Gnome has changed, since I am not using Unity (sticking to Gnome-Shell) and the same happens to me.\nYou will find another Icon under the System Settings (I am not sure how stuff is called because the default of my system is not in English) called Background. You can also access it clicking on the desktop with the right mouse button and choosing \"Change Background\".\n", "Q: Do many desktop environments slow down the system? Ubuntu originally has several available desktop environments to be chosen during login (like Gnome and Unity). I want to install others like KDE, LXDE, XFCE, etc.\nI wonder if installing many other desktop environments/user interfaces will slow down the system? Or they are static files reside on the disk, and no effect on the system when their corresponding desktop environment are not used?\n\nA: My compliments for the desire to try out alternatives, and not stick to 'out of the box' -- that's the FOSS attitude!\nUnless you have concurrent users running different desktops at the same time, the other desktop environments will not slow down the system. They are mainly sitting statically on the disk.\nIn fact, you are likely to find out that some lightweight desktop environments will provide a snappier user experience overall, notably on lower end machines. If you particularly like one, you could even consider replacing the ubuntu-desktop package by the desktop environment of your choice. \nIf you want blazingly fast (and completely austere), try running only X with a window manager.

I want to find a list of all of the files that I have created or modified since I installed Ubuntu 12.04.\nI mainly want to do this so that I can find all the files that I have created or modified, and then move them to my other Ubuntu installation.\n\nA: use find\nfind /home -user $USER -mtime -90\n\nThe -mtime is the number of days, so -90 is the last 90 days. Adjust the number of says as needed.\nSee also http://content.hccfl.edu/pollock/unix/findcmd.htm\nIt may just be easier to copy all of home, cp -Ra home or use rsync\nhttps://help.ubuntu.com/community/rsync\n"]
