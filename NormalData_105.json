["Q: French version of Ubuntu-one for Windows I'm a French new user and I'd like to show Ubuntu-one working on Windows for newbies. The problem is that the Windows application is downloadable in English and I’d like it in French.\nIs there a French version of Ubuntu-one for Windows ?\n\nA: We have not yet translated the windows version to other languages. We intend to do it once we sync our Windows and Linux codebases, and can use the translations for both.\n", "Q: How do you import music on mp3 at 320 kbps in banshee, or any other media player? When you import music to banshee the default bitrate seems to be 128kbps (I don't like this, disk space is cheap so give me the highest quality please), how do you change this to be something like 320 kbps? Or are we stuck with this?\n\nA: I'm assuming you're referring to importing audio from CDs, because importing digital music from your filesystem into Banshee shouldn't change the bitrate.\n\n\n*\n\n*Open Edit > Preferences\n\n*From the Source Specific tab, set the Source to \"Audio CDs\"\n\n*With \"MP3 (LAME Encoder)\" selected, click the \"Edit\" button\n\n*From there, you should be able to set the bitrate to something higher, like 320kbps\n\n\n\n\nA: Ubuntu 11.10 64-bit\nI installed gstreamer0.10-plugins-bad-multiverse 0.10.21-1 in the hope that I could import to aac (m4a) using Banshee, but no luck.\nI then installed sound-juicer 2.32.1+20110330-1 (Audio CD Extractor), and now I have m4a's from my CD, though without album or artist metadata.\n", "Q: What is the current state of apple device (iPhone, iPod, etc.) support? \n*\n\n*What ubuntu applications provide support? (guides, how to's, status)\n\n*Also, specifically, details on support for syncing music to iPhone's and iPod's with the latest OS version:\n\n\n*\n\n*Can you sync music to apple devices using >iOS4? (iPhone & iPod)\n\n*What applications allow you to do this and how? (guides, how to's, status)\n\n\n\nWhat has already been established is:\n\n\n*\n\n*Apple does not support Linux and has no plans to.\n\n*libimobiledevice provides some support, however it currently does not support music/video synchronization with devices >iOS4. Go to libimobiledevice and scroll to the section titled \"Status\" to see if your device version is supported. \n\n\nA: Try libimobiledevice. Scroll to the section titled \"Status\" to see if your device version is supported. \n\nlibimobiledevice is a cross-platform software library that talks the protocols to support iPhone®, iPod Touch®, iPad® and Apple TV® devices. Unlike other projects, it does not depend on using any existing proprietary libraries and does not require jailbreaking. It allows other software to easily access the device's filesystem, retrieve information about the device and it's internals, backup/restore the device, manage SpringBoard® icons, manage installed applications, retrieve addressbook/calendars/notes and bookmarks and (using libgpod) synchronize music and video to the device. The library is in development since August 2007 with the goal to bring support for these devices to the Linux Desktop. — http://www.libimobiledevice.org/\n\n\nA: Just going to add that it's libgpod that currently can't handle DBVersion > 4. The most recent release goes back to July, as does the most recent commit ( http://gtkpod.git.sourceforge.net/git/gitweb.cgi?p=gtkpod/libgpod;a=summary )\nI don't know what the status is but my guess is that it's currently on hold and not being worked on.\nThey however implemented the following in version 0.8.2 so who knows when someone out there will provide a solution to this.\n\niPhone 4/iPod Touch 4/iPad/Nano 6g are still unsupported in this\n  release. However, libgpod now has a mechanism to dynamically load a\n  module named $libdir/libgpod/libhashab.so. This will be useful to\n  easily enable support for these devices if someone comes up with a way\n  to compute the music database checksum.\n\nYou can read the full release note here : http://old.nabble.com/libgpod-0.8.2-td32125543.html\n=================\nUpdate:  User Israr Khan seems to be working on this right now, you can get a quick idea of the status on his twitter: http://twitter.com/#!/isrark\n\nA: While reading through this site and using google, I've found a way to be able to sync my iPhone 4 on iOS 7.0.2 on Ubuntu 12.04.  These instructions I've compiled from other users, and from the libimobiledevice github repo.\nFirst, make sure the following packages are installed, either through the Ubuntu Software Center, or through the Terminal:\ngit\nlibgnutls\nlibgnutls-dev\nlibplist\nlibplist-dev\nlibusbmuxd\nlibusbmuxd-dev\nusbmuxd\nmake\nautoconf # this should also install automake\nautoheader\nlibtool\npkg-config\ngcc\n\n# optional but recommended\n\ncython \ndoxygen\n\nSecond, create a folder somewhere on your computer (I will use a folder on my desktop called libupdate).\nOpen the terminal and CD to that directory:\ncd ~/Desktop/libupdate\n\nOnce you do that, type or copy/paste this into the console:\ngit clone http://git.sukimashita.com/libimobiledevice.git\n\nWait for the repo to download. Keep that Terminal window open\nOnce that completes, open the folder that was created when you ran the above command (should be called libimobiledevice).  Double click the file called autogen.sh and click Run in Terminal.  It will open a new terminal window that will close when it's finished.\nTo run these next commands first cd into the libimobiledevice directory that was created through the git clone command above by typing:\ncd libimobiledevice\n\nThese next commands can be run as-is, but I recommend running as sudo to minimize chances of issues arising.  The last command MUST be run as sudo.  Run these one at a time, let them complete before running the next\n./configure\nmake\nsudo make install\n\nOnce this completes, restart your computer.\nOnce you log back in to your computer, unlock your iPhone.  Ignore any dialogs that pop up on your computer.  Follow these next steps EXACTLY AS I LIST THEM\n\n\n*\n\n*Plug the USB end of the cable into the computer\n\n*Plug the iPhone end of the cable into the iPhone\n\n*The trust dialog will come up\n\n*You must be quick for this next step, tap on Trust and IMMEDIATELY UNPLUG THE IPHONE FROM THE CABLE! You must pull the cable out before the iPhone vibrates/reconnects and brings the trust dialog up again. If this happens, do this step again\n\n*Lock your iPhone\n\n*Plug your iPhone back in\n\n*Unlock your iPhone, ignore any dialogs that pop up on either your computer or the iPhone (Trust Dialog shouldn't come up)\n\n*In a Terminal, run the following command\nidevicepair pair\n\n*The Terminal should report this as successful and your device should be accessible from your computer, to test this run Shotwell (from the terminal or the dash).  Click on your iPhone and your pictures should come up.\nYou can also click on your iPhone in the devices section in the Nautilus file browser. If something comes up on your iPhone hit Trust ONLY ONCE! and click try again, continue, etc. on your computer.  Your iPhone may then come up twice.  The one that says documents is for apps that have some sort of file sharing/document access (like music downloaders or ringtone makers).\nIf you want to backup your iPhone, run this command\nidevicebackup2 backup --full <path/to/where/you/want/to/backup>\n\nIf you want to backup/copy your photos and videos, open Shotwell and import your photos (CTRL+A, right click, import)\nIf you want to copy your music/music videos/movies onto your computer, open Rhythmbox and  select your iPhone, then make sure you can see all of your music (videos and ringotones won't have a title, music might, depending if you ever edited their tags in iTunes originally).  Then, select all (CTRL+A), and drag them into a folder on your computer.  They might have weird names, blame iTunes.\nI haven't tried adding anything yet, but atleast you can access your files and backup you iPhone now!\n\nA: This a constantly moving target. If you find a tool that works, Apple breaks it in a 'security update' (they sometimes use the term subjectively). For some iPods, try replacing the firmware with Rockbox. For iPhones stick with Windows or a Mac, or try setting up a Windows guest OS with  VirtualBox in Ubuntu.  \nApple will never allow this kind of interoperability to happen, long-term. You are going to have to accept their rules for their devices, or find a device that you can root and load with alternate firmware.\n\nA: Apples support of Linux is non-existing. There is not a single version of iOS that supports Ubuntu. Please file a bug with Apple.\nAlso, Apple frequently uses obfuscation techniques, which are likely to break the music database on iDevices. \nRE: I just want to add here that I have filed numerous bug reports with Apple, also mentioning that I refuse to have Windows and therefore have Linux Ubuntu installed on my laptop as well as owing iPhone3, iPhone4, iPhone5 and an iMac and that it's quite frustrating that I can't use my Ubuntu to at least manage my music and so on...\nThey have never replied a single letter, never mind any explanation and all that ignorance is pretty frustrating to the point that I will probably switch to Android device next time I`m getting a new phone.\n\nA: I have connected my iPod shuffle and recognized it as an iPod and I know that you can sync it with Rythmbox. Just make sure the Portable Players plug-ins are enabled via \nTools > Plugins\n\n\nA: Everyone appears in agreement that any kind of Linux integration with iTunes is shaky at best.  For me at least though the real problem is \"how do I copy music from Linux onto an iDevice and play it\"; iTunes is not a requirement.  Here is my solution to that much more tractable problem.\n\n\n*\n\n*Install foobar2000 on your iDevice (I love fb2k on the desktop - enough to run it in Wine, just discovered the app version, hope it's anywhere near as good)\n\n*Start foobar2000, gear icon in upper right for Tools, FTP Server\n\n\n*\n\n*Allow write access = on\n\n*Server running = on\n\n\n*Connect to the IP address listed using the FTP client of your choice and upload music to foobar2000 Music Folder (I suspect I'll use rclone to handle syncing eventually)\n\n\nAfter exiting the FTP server foobar2000 will see your music and you are off to the races.  And if you don't like foobar2000 as a player I suspect other 3rd party apps could also play from the file system.\n", "Q: Switch between Ubuntu and Windows 7 Is it at all possible to switch between Windows and Ubuntu by press of a button, on a system with Windows 7 - Ubuntu 11.10 dual boot set up?\n\nA: You cannot have two operating systems running next to each other at the same time. So there is no way to simply press a button and go to Windows.\nWhat you could do is use virtualization, for example using VirtualBox. You boot one operating system normally, and run the other operating system in a virtual machine inside VirtualBox.\nNote that there are some limitations to this - the OS running in the virtual machine does not have direct access to the hardware, so performance might be a little lower and 3D graphics etc. won't work as well as when running natively.\n\nA: When you are booted up in Windows or Ubuntu, you can't switch to the other one. In dual boot you can be either in one or the other. If you want to switch between them live, you want to decide on one of them being the host and then through a virtual machine (WMPlayer) add the second OS. \nThis will have a master/slave, host/guest relationship between the 2 OSes. But one of them will be virtual.\nIt's a good way to test one of them.\n\nA: The only way to boot a Windows install of any kind after booting into Ubuntu is by running it within a virtual system. You can create a shortcut link placed on your desktop that will autorun virtualbox for example, thus giving you the effect of \"pushing a button\" to run Windows. It's an option inside virtualbox to create this shortcut too, so it's fairly simple.\n\nA: Actually, provided your hardware is compatible, you could pretty much accomplish what you have in mind using XenClinet 2 under which ALL of your operating systems would be running as virtual operating systems.\nNote that, at the very least, your CPU must support VT-x or AMD-V to run XenClinet 2.  Also, XenClinet 2 is currently in a \"free to try\" phase of development.  Not sure what will be the cost/availability of XenClinet 2 in the future.\nThe above in mind, VirtualBox or VMware, as suggested by others, is probably the easier approach.\n\nA: Use iReboot for OS switching. But of course, you will need to restart.\n\nA: Of course you can have two(or more) Operating Systems running at the same time. That's no problem.\nThe appropriate keyword is Virtualization and the suitable OS is called Qubes OS.\nQubes is a mature virtualization OS which can run Linux and Windows side-by-side. \nSo switching between both with a key combo is very much possible (and likely).\n(Switching between Ubuntu and Windows 7 is fully supported by the time I write this.)\n", "Q: What is the difference between add-apt-repository & apt-add-repository? Difference between add-apt-repository & apt-add-repository  ?\n\nA: They're the same command, someone just added the inverse because people kept mixing the command up and typing it wrong.\n\nA: An easy way to find this out would have been:\nminibun:~> ls -l `which apt-add-repository`\nlrwxrwxrwx 1 root root 18 2011-08-26 15:36 /usr/bin/apt-add-repository -> add-apt-repository\n\nYou can see that apt-add-repository is simply a symlink to add-apt-repository :)\n", "Q: GRUB install to wrong partition has broken Windows startup While installing Ubuntu 11.04 there was an option to choose where GRUB should be installed. The options were each partition or the entire drive. I accidentally chose a Windows partition and now I it no longer boots.\nWhat should have GRUB's location been?\n\nA: Choose the MBR (master boot record). That's the default choice, and it's the only choice that makes sense in >99% of installations.\nIf your system can't boot now, insert the installation CD/USB and repair the bootloader.\nThen you'll need to repair the Windows bootloader (the bit at the beginning of the Windows partition) as well. On older versions, the command to run was sys c:; I don't know if that's still true.\n", "Q: Keyboard shortcuts in gnome-classic I am using gnome-classic in ubuntu 11.10 & I am not able to figure out the shortcut for the \"Applications\" list and \"Places\" list.\n\nA: Try Alt+F1 and Alt+F2 for Applications drop down and \"Run Application\" dialog.\n", "Q: Can Grub2 menu be hidden a la Windows? Is there a way to hide the Grub2 menu so that it does not show by default and boots off the pre-selected OS immediately unless another key, like F8 in Windows, is pressed after BIOS to intercept the boot?\n\nA: Run gksudo gedit /etc/default/grub Set GRUB_HIDDEN_TIMEOUT to the number of seconds you want to have to press shift before it starts booting and take the hash # mark out of in front of it. Save the file and the changes will be applied next time you boot.\n\nA: Yes of course you can.The easy way is the following:\nInstall startupmanager package by opening a  terminal window and typing\n  sudo apt-get install startupmanager\nThen run startupmanager and set timeout in seconds to 0 .Press the close button and once the \"performing post-configuration tasks\" window dissappears you are done ! \n`\n\n", "Q: Directory bookmarks for open/save files in Matlab I have Matlab 7.11.0 (R2010b) under my Ubuntu 10.10. \nEvery time I need to save a new file edited in its editor, Matlab starts from my $home address, so I have to manually go directory by directory before getting to my destination.\nI wonder if there is some way either by or outside Matlab that can made it smart to use the bookmarks in Nautilus, or store some history for quick accessing previous directories?\nThanks and regards!\n\nA: On my Matlab version there is a drop-down list called \"Current Directory:\" in the \"Matlab Toolbar\". It saves recent directories.\nAlso, in the editor, you can type cd and press the up button to get the relevant history.\n", "Q: What are mountpoints, and which one should I pick? When a Ubuntu is fresh installed an option called Mount Point is shown in Advanced Install.On clicking it i get a dropdown list with options:\n/\n/home\n/bin\nswap\n\netc\nWhat exactly are they? and which one is best suited for 11.10?\n\nA: A mountpoint defines where in the filesystem that particular drive is mounted.\nThe root of the filesystem is always / - and you must always have one. Everything lives in here.\nYou can then (optionally) add other mountpoints to segregate your data, for instance /home contains all your user-specific files. So you might have another bigger hard drive that you want all your user files on if you're storing lots of photos in your home directory.\nHowever, the most basic use-case is to simply start with one drive and mount it at /, which is likely what you want for now.\nThe only special case is swap, which is not a mountpoint in the normal filesystem, but is used as additional memory (on disk) - Windows calls it a pagefile.\n", "Q: Unable to use CD/DVD drive after upgrade to 11.10 Just after my upgrade to Ubuntu 11.10 I can not use my cd/dvd drive. \nThe problem is that in Nautilus the CD/DVD icon appears ok, BUT, when I put any kind of media on the CD/DVD Driver, the icon vanishes and I can not mount (even by my self with pmount, mount, etc ) the driver.\nDoes anyone else have this strange behavior ?\n\nA: If you are using kernel 3.1 by a chance - downgarde it (for example to 3.0).\nI had similar problem - I couldn't mount cdrom drive anyhow. Downgrading solved my problem and it works just fine!\n", "Q: Where is search on Ubuntu Software Center? It seems to have disappeared.   The menu Edit/Search doesn't work, either.\n\nI've filed a launchpad bug-report.\n\nA: Gary Lasker from Canoical contacted me through launchpad.  He asked me to run Ubuntu Software Center from a terminal using the command line.\n⋯$ software-center\nI did that and the search box is back.  There were no updates in the interim so it possibly was a one time thing (so far).\nThanks to Gary for getting back to me quickly!\n\nA: Ubuntu 20.04 LTS\nThe Search textbox is hidden by default, it is automatically displayed when typing.\n\nA: Maybe this answer is just silly, but it is not just the case that the window is not big enough to show the Search textbox? If i resize my window to that size, the Search disappears because there's no space to it be shown.\n", "Q: Where do I need to change \"Ubuntu\" when naming my own custom distribution? i am building my own distro (which i am almost done) but one thing left is the name of it. since i am not sure what to name it im leaving the \"ubuntu\" there\ni know i will have to change the following files\n\n\n*\n\n*/etc/lsb-release\n\n*/etc/issue\n\n\nto my own name and version and code name. am i missing other files?\n(on my site it shows it's an ubuntu version - i read the tm etc... but i want the name of my distro to be there)\nthanks\n\nA: Here's my two cents about this:\nYou can try to change the name of the distribution but be careful, if you change something wrong, you might encounter problems while installing or later when you will use it. But if your absolutely need to change it here's what you can try:\nThe two you provided are correct (you can also update /etc/issue.net just to be sure). The other thing you can do is this:\nOpen the ISO (ISO Master) file and go to the folder called .disk. In there is a file called info. The release name is there and can be changed. view this post.\nThis should change the name of your distribution.\nIf that does not work, you can change the following files:\nNOTE: the location might change depending the version you are using and file might be not found as well\n\n\n*\n\n*/boot/grub/grub.cfg \n\n*/etc/grub.d/00_header\n\n*/etc/grub.d/05_debian_theme\n\n*/usr/share/yelp/ (all files & all sub folders)\n\n*/var/run/motd\n\n*/etc/motd\n\n*/etc/update-motd.d/10-help-text\n\n*/lib/init/rw/motd\n\n*/etc/gdm/failsafeXinit\n\n*/etc/samba/smb.conf\n\n*/usr/share/gnome-about/gnome-version.xml\n\n*/usr/share/pyshared/usbcreator/install.py\n\n*/usr/bin/grub-mkrescue\n\n*/usr/lib/grub/i386-pc/config.h\n\n*/usr/sbin/grub-install.real\n\n*/usr/sbin/grub-mkconfig\n\n*/usr/sbin/grub-mknetdir\n\n*/usr/sbin/grub-reboot\n\n*/usr/sbin/grub-set-default\n\n\ngood luck!\n\nA: Also you have to look at '/etc/os-release' too.

As the screenshot shows.\n\nIf I then start the update manager I can install the kernel, with no problems at all. As the second screenshot shows.\n\nWhy is this?\n\nA: This is the difference between upgrade and dist-upgrade. The first never install new packages.\n\nA: This is why!\nThe kernel is a new package and not an upgrade of an old one, this is why you can't use the command upgrade that upgrades/updates packages. You need to use the command dist-upgrade to install new packages.\nWhen you have updated to the new kernel you can run the old one as well. That's why it's a new package and not just a upgrade.\n", "Q: What packages did Midori install for it to run that I should uninstall to be completely rid of Midori?

I tend to switch back and forth from different environments within the *buntu ecosystem but I was wondering if I could just install all of the Desktop Environments onto Ubuntu 11.10 and be able to switch to them if I wanted to.\n\nA: There is nothing really stopping you installing multiple desktop environments.  It is safe to do so.\nHowever - the key issue is that every environment comes with its own set of default applications.  This can leave your menu very cluttered with applications from each environment where the application hasn't been specifically limited to one particular desktop.\nI personally have multiple virtual guests, each with a single desktop distro and all linked with common folder to enable sharing of files.

I thought I'd start having a look at 12.04. Since the image is going to change a lot in the near future, I thought it would be wise to use jigit. As I recall, it only downloads things that have changed since the last time? \nI installed the package \"jigit\". Now what? It doesn't provide a jigit command. \n\nA: This isn't an answer how to use jigit, but I think you're using the wrong tool for the job here. \njigdo (and it's associated tools like jigit) is useful to people who have an Ubuntu mirror handy and want to assemble an ISO out of that archive. I've done this and it's kind of annoying, it's more a tool for people who run archives and want to make it available to jigdo users.\nIt sounds like you want to save bandwidth and so you don't have to redownload things in the ISO. The end user tool you want to use for that is zsync. In the ISO directory of ubuntu releases (and mirrors) you will find a .zsync file that you can use to keep your ISO up to date. You use it like this:\nzsync http://cdimages.ubuntu.com/daily/current/precise-alternate-amd64.iso.zsync\n\nWill keep an up to date ISO of the alternate installer for precise for you. The next day you just run that again and it will sync just the differences between the 2 ISOs. \nThe testing tool testdrive is a convenient tool for testing development releases in a VM; it has built in support for zsync downloading. You can use testdrive to make getting the ISOs easier. \nIt has downloading functionality built in, which will ask you which ISO you want and then keep an updated copy for you in ~/.cache/testdrive/iso, and the GTK gui will automatically notify you when new ISOs are available or you can just use the command line version. \n\nA: If you install the jigit package, it should provide the jigit command, which you can use in accordance with the instructions on the jigit manpage. This is a reasonable way to create an Ubuntu .iso image when you already have many of the package files that go into it, which would ordinarily only be the case (starting out) if you were running the same release that you're trying to make an .iso for.\nYou should probably not use jigit for testing Precise, for two reasons:\n\n\n*\n\n*Part of what's valuable about testing is to test is the specific, official daily-live .iso images that have been created. These eventually lead to the numbered alpha and beta images and ultimately to the release image, so testing them specifically is good.\n\n*There is already a mechanism in place for avoiding excessive downloading of duplicate data. The daily-live .iso images support zsync. For example, if you want the Precise i386 daily-live .iso image, you can run:\nzsync http://cdimage.ubuntu.com/daily-live/current/precise-desktop-i386.iso.zsync\nThe first time you run that, it will just download the whole thing. Subsequent runs will download only what is necessary to bring the .iso image you have up to the latest .iso image that has been released.\nYou should be aware that while the daily-live is the latest Precise image most of the time, it is not the latest all of the time. When a numbered alpha or beta release has just come out, it is the latest, and daily-lives are often suspended for several days following such a release, so it is important to use the numbered alpha or beta whenever there is no daily-live that is more recent. If the numbered alpha or beta image has a .zsync file of its own then you could rename the daily-live .iso you have so its name is the same as the numbered alpha or beta .iso, then zync up to the numbered alpha or beta .iso. Otherwise (or if you want to even further reduce load on Ubuntu servers), you could just get the numbered alpha or beta image by torrent.\n\nA: I have only been able to find just slight documentation on the use of jigit.

It is supposed to work with older/more stable software. The 11.10 should be a more bleding edge distribution.

Once an application is first launched in OS X from the dock, it stays open in the background, even after you close all open windows for that application. For example, if I open Google Chrome from the dock and start a session with 3 windows, then close all of those windows when finished with them, the Chrome icon will retain the small dot under its dock icon signifying that it is still 'open in the background'. This makes opening further windows for that application almost instant, rather than having to reload the application every time to create a new window. I am wondering if it is possible to implement this feature in a Linux environment, as I have not found a way to do so.\nNote that I am only talking about the application launching mechanism, I am aware of Docky and other programs that simulate the OS X dock, but I have not yet came across a way to make Linux exhibit this preloading behaviour.\nThank you\n\nA: Hi there. I'm not sure if this specifically addresses your dock question, but I have found some information about the pre-loading feature that you are talking about. \nHave you taken a look at Preload?

What is meant by \"depends\" and \"pre-depends\", and the difference between those 2 types of package requirements when I am installing something in Ubuntu?\n\nA: The term \"dependency\" can be used broadly to encompass \"Depends\" and \"Pre-Depends\" relationships (and sometimes even other, weaker relationships), or it can be used narrowly as a synonym of \"Depends.\"\nThe difference between \"Depends\" and \"Pre-Depends\" package relationships is that if X depends on Y, then Y must be fully configured before X gets configured. (Configuration is the installation step where a package, once its files are unpacked to the proper locations--i.e., once \"installed\"--has whatever other necessary changes made so that it is possible to actually use the software it provides. For example, configuration of an HTTP server might involve making sure there is a www user with proper abilities and a /var/www directory with proper permissions.) In contrast, if X pre-depends on Y then Y must be installed and (usually) fully configured before X is even installed.\nSee Section 7.2 of the Debian Policy Manual for more details. I quote the two most relevant sections here, but there is other information in that section (and in chapter 7 more generally) that helps to illuminate how dependencies work.\n\n\nDepends\nThis declares an absolute dependency. A package will not be configured unless all of the packages listed in its Depends field have been correctly configured (unless there is a circular dependency as described above).\nThe Depends field should be used if the depended-on package is required for the depending package to provide a significant amount of functionality.\nThe Depends field should also be used if the postinst or prerm scripts require the depended-on package to be unpacked or configured in order to run. In the case of postinst configure, the depended-on packages will be unpacked and configured first. (If both packages are involved in a dependency loop, this might not work as expected; see the explanation a few paragraphs back.) In the case of prerm or other postinst actions, the package dependencies will normally be at least unpacked, but they may be only \"Half-Installed\" if a previous upgrade of the dependency failed.\nFinally, the Depends field should be used if the depended-on package is needed by the postrm script to fully clean up after the package removal. There is no guarantee that package dependencies will be available when postrm is run, but the depended-on package is more likely to be available if the package declares a dependency (particularly in the case of postrm remove). The postrm script must gracefully skip actions that require a dependency if that dependency isn't available.\n\n\n\nPre-Depends\nThis field is like Depends, except that it also forces dpkg to complete installation of the packages named before even starting the installation of the package which declares the pre-dependency, as follows:\nWhen a package declaring a pre-dependency is about to be unpacked the pre-dependency can be satisfied if the depended-on package is either fully configured, or even if the depended-on package(s) are only unpacked or in the \"Half-Configured\" state, provided that they have been configured correctly at some point in the past (and not removed or partially removed since). In this case, both the previously-configured and currently unpacked or \"Half-Configured\" versions must satisfy any version clause in the Pre-Depends field.\nWhen the package declaring a pre-dependency is about to be configured, the pre-dependency will be treated as a normal Depends. It will be considered satisfied only if the depended-on package has been correctly configured. However, unlike with Depends, Pre-Depends does not permit circular dependencies to be broken. If a circular dependency is encountered while attempting to honor Pre-Depends, the installation will be aborted.\nPre-Depends are also required if the preinst script depends on the named package. It is best to avoid this situation if possible.\nPre-Depends should be used sparingly, preferably only by packages whose premature upgrade or installation would hamper the ability of the system to continue with any upgrade that might be in progress.\nYou should not specify a Pre-Depends entry for a package before this has been discussed on the debian-devel mailing list and a consensus about doing that has been reached. See Dependencies, Section 3.5.\n\n\nA: As taken from this link: https://www.debian.org/doc/debian-policy/#document-ch-relationships\nThere are 5 types of dependencies:\nThe meaning of the five dependency fields is as follows:\nDepends\n\n\n*\n\n*This declares an absolute dependency. A package will not be configured unless all of the packages listed in its Depends field have been correctly configured. The Depends field should be used if the depended-on package is required for the depending package to provide a significant amount of functionality. The Depends field should also be used if the postinst or prerm scripts require the depended-on package to be unpacked or configured in order to run. In the case of postinst configure, the depended-on packages will be unpacked and configured first. \n\n*In the case of prerm or other postinst actions, the package dependencies will normally be at least unpacked, but they may be only \"Half-Installed\" if a previous upgrade of the dependency failed. Finally, the Depends field should be used if the depended-on package is needed by the postrm script to fully clean up after the package removal. There is no guarantee that package dependencies will be available when postrm is run, but the depended-on package is more likely to be available if the package declares a dependency (particularly in the case of postrm remove). The postrm script must gracefully skip actions that require a dependency if that dependency isn't available.\nRecommends\n\n\n*\n\n*This declares a strong, but not absolute, dependency. The Recommends field should list packages that would be found together with this one in all but unusual installations. \n\n\nSuggests\n\n\n*\n\n*This is used to declare that one package may be more useful with one or more others. Using this field tells the packaging system and the user that the listed packages are related to this one and can perhaps enhance its usefulness, but that installing this one without them is perfectly reasonable.\n\n\nEnhances\n\n\n*\n\n*This field is similar to Suggests but works in the opposite direction. It is used to declare that a package can enhance the functionality of another package.\n\n\nPre-Depends\n\n\n*\n\n*This field is like Depends, except that it also forces dpkg to complete installation of the packages named before even starting the installation of the package which declares the pre-dependency, It works like this, when a package declaring a pre-dependency is about to be unpacked the pre-dependency can be satisfied if the depended-on package is either fully configured, or even if the depended-on package(s) are only unpacked or in the \"Half-Configured\" state, provided that they have been configured correctly at some point in the past (and not removed or partially removed since). \n\n*In this case, both the previously-configured and currently unpacked or \"Half-Configured\" versions must satisfy any version clause in the Pre-Depends field.

It is best to avoid this situation if possible. Pre-Depends should be used sparingly, preferably only by packages whose premature upgrade or installation would hamper the ability of the system to continue with any upgrade that might be in progress.\nSmaller Version:\n\n\n*\n\n*Both depends and pre-depends mention the dependencies a package needs before installing but pre-depends forces the installation and configuration of the dependency packages before even starting with the package that needs the dependencies. dpkg will not even unpack the main package until all pre-depend packages have been dealt with. With depends, the order of the dependency packages and the main one is not important. With pre-depends it takes into consideration this and also the verification if the pre-depends packages are configures and installed or not. Without this, the main package will not even be unpacked, configured or installed. You must either have the dependencies installed before starting the process of working with the main package. If not, they have to be downloaded/configured/installed first before proceeding. pre-depends are normally used in cases where the stability of the package is important and would not affect the system or program in a very bad way but this cases are avoided with several norms also mentioned in the link above.\n\n", "Q: How Do I Make a Static IP with WLAN0? I am trying to set a static IP address for my server, but what ifconfig is returning is leaving me a little bit confused:\nIf I run the command\nifconfig\n\nI see that wlan0 is the only returned option that is sending and receiving packets besides the local loopback.

To do this they need to be in a theme directory, or part of the custom theme for the application.  You can add a theme directory using app_indicator_set_icon_theme_path().  This allows the application indicator service to know where to look for your custom icons.  You can also install the icons in the default icon theme which is located in /usr/share/themes/hicolor.\nLastly, as a total hack, you can generate them on the fly.

I had been using it for about a week, but decided to install Windows 7 (64-bit) in order to utilize Networking with my home server (running Windows Server 2000). My system is 64-bit based, and thus I had no problems installing other than a basic RAM error that required me to remove my RAM down to a single stick. I played with the settings in Windows 7 for around an hour before I shut down. After reinstalling the RAM, Windows 7 would not boot. In this, I then assumed that something about my system was rejecting Win7 and I reinstalled Ubuntu. However, now Ubuntu (11.10) boots into black screen, and I've already attempted activating the grub menu with the shift key, and following steps listed here: https://wiki.ubuntu.com/X/Troubleshooting/BlankScreen but nothing seems to work. I've reinstalled twice now, with the same result each time.\nNow, the very odd part about this whole scenario is that the USB I installed from has no problems booting as a live USB. This puzzles me greatly, because the hard drive boots straight to black screen and the live USB loads normally. At this point, my only theory is that the boot sector of the hard disk was somehow corrupted with Win7, and that Ubuntu was unable to completely write through. I used Darik's Boot n Nuke to wipe the drive, but was met with an error, this also puzzles me because the hard disk has no promblems reading or writing. Any suggestions/comments are appreciated. If you have a theory, I will be more than happy to oblige.\nAdditional information:\nIntel Core2 Duo e6400 2.13GHz\nnVidia GeForce 7-series (7900 GS)\n4 GB DDR2 333MHz (2x 2GB)\nDell XPS 410 BIOS Revision 2.5.3\n\nA: I apologize for taking up space here, but I discovered the problem on my own earlier today. I ran a diagnostic on my harddrive after running a boot repair utility. After running the utility, I received, \"Unexpectedly disconnected from boot daemon.\" This prompted me to perform a full scan diagnostic on the drive, which kept returning an error. I then attempted using DBAN, or Darik's Boot 'n' Nuke, again but was also met with an error here. I ran the drive in an external enclosure and ran a scan from another computer. This time I turned up the problem: A corrupted boot sector on the physical disk. While this will require a rebuild (a new hard drive), I recommend that anyone else who encounters this problem take heed from this post.\n", "Q: How Can I Upgrade to 11.10 from the Command Line? I am trying to upgrade my 11.04 Ubuntu operating system to 11.10, as the current system is not the most recent.\nHowever, I cannot use the GUI to upgrade - as from past experience I have learned this - because my graphics hardware only works on 10.04 to 11.04 (non-inclusive) and from 11.10+. So once I can get to 11.10, I should be just fine.\nBecause of this, I need to find a way to upgrade the OS from the command line. Can this be done?\nThanks for any and all help.\n\nA: From the Ubuntu help website:\nsudo apt-get install update-manager-core\nsudo do-release-upgrade\n\nAlso from the manpage for do-release-upgrade:\nDESCRIPTION\n   Upgrade   the   operating   system  to  the  latest  release  from  the\n   command-line.  This is the preferred command  if  the  machine  has  no\n   graphic  environment  or if the machine is to be upgraded over a remote\n   connection.\n\nDisclaimer: I always install a fresh copy (I tweak and hack things on my installs, so it would be more hassle to upgrade than start fresh), so I have never tried upgrading through either the GUI or the command line. But this is the official method of doing the upgrade so it should be fine. I'd still back up any important data first though.\n\nA: Try do-release-upgrade as root. That should upgrade the system.\n", "Q: Ubuntu Font Family and Mac OS X confusing font name and font I really like the Ubuntu Font Family, and frequently use it in my documents. At school, I want to be able to use the font family so my documents that make at home using Ubuntu show up correctly at school. However, we do not have permission to use Font View (which also allows you to install fonts), so I copied the .ttf files for the Ubuntu font into the /home/Library/Fonts directory. The fonts now show up in the list of available fonts. \nHowever, when I click on Ubuntu Light, it uses the Ubuntu font, and when I click on Ubuntu, it uses the Ubuntu Light font. This is irritating because my documents that I make on my home computer show up in the opposite font at school, and documents I make at school show up in the opposite font at home. This is really irritating. My school uses Mac OSX 10.4. Any help would be greatly appreciated.\nEdit: This happens with Windows too, so it's something wrong with the font that Ubuntu put on the website.\n\nA: As indicated in the comments, this sounds like a known problem with the Ubuntu Font Family.

I do a lot of typing, and frequently bump the touchpad, messing up my work and annoying me. So, I would like to enable the ability to disable the touchpad by double-tapping on the area in the upper left hand corner. Unfortunately, there is no function key backup to disable the touchpad.\nThis does not work in Ubuntu.

Does anyone know the latest AMI that has the preconfigured Postfix mail server on it, for use with a \"micro\" instance of Amazon EC2?   I'm having trouble searching for a AMI instance using ElasticFox .   I can't find anything newer than like 2009...\n\nA: Never look for AMIs using ElasticFox or using the community tab in Amazon's EC2 console or using the ec2-describe-images -a command.  These tools make it difficult to know who publishes the AMIs which is critical in determining what AMIs you can trust.\nAlways look for an AMI id in a list that is published by a source that you trust.  For an Ubuntu AMI, that would be a place like:\nhttp://cloud.ubuntu.com/ami/\nIf you trust me, you can also look in the table I publish at the top of:\nhttp://Alestic.com\nThis table is updated automatically from the list of AMIs published by Canonical.\nScott Moser has written a longer article that talks about the challenge of finding the right Ubuntu AMI:\nhttp://ubuntu-smoser.blogspot.com/2011/07/how-to-find-right-ubuntu-ami-on-ec2.html\nThere's no need to look for an AMI with Postfix pre-installed or pre-configured.  Not only are these unlikely to come from trusted sources, but they are also unlikely to be configured in exactly the way that you need them to be.  \nPostfix can be used for many different purposes and you need to make sure yours is configured with the correct values for your installation (outbound, inbound, domain names, relays, certificates, etc.).\nYou can start with a standard Ubuntu server AMI and install Postfix yourself using apt-get or aptitude.

This answer talks about the ISO manifests - an example is here.. \nIs it possible to build an ISO from a manifest file, or is the manifest file just \ndpkg --get-selections put into a text file?\nRelated, sorta:\n\n\n*\n\n*How do I make my own customized Ubuntu version?\n\n*How to customize the Ubuntu Live CD?\n\nA: The filesystem.manifest is generated with the command:\ndpkg-query -W --showformat='${Package} ${Version}\\n' > casper/filesystem.manifest\n\nThe syntax is thus package_name version, Example : \n xserver-xorg-video-nouveau  1:0.0.16+git20110411+8378443-1\n\nThe format of dpkg --get-selections is slightly different, package_name install\nExample\nxserver-xorg-video-nouveau  install \n\nSo you can use the file, in probably more then one way,\napt-get install -y $(awk '{print $1}' filesystem.manifest)\n\nTo be honest, after making a few custom iso over the years, there is a learning curve to how it works. Once you understand a few things, it is not too hard, it is just the requite knowledge is moderately large and there is no single, up to date, source of information.\nYou use 2 build directories\n~/custom - build directory for the iso\n~/rootfs - build directory for the root file system.\n\ncustom - this directory contains all the files that will go onto the final iso. It contains the root file system, a kernel, an initramfs, and isolinux.\nrootfs - this directory contains the live CD file system and you compress this directory (using mksquashfs) and include it on the CD. You either build this with debootstrap (live D from scratch) or extract the file system from the ubuntu-desktop.iso (customize a live CD). See the ubuntu wiki links below for details.\nkey points\n1) Understand mksquashfs - you use mksquashfs to compress the root file system to casper/filesystem.squashfs\nsudo mksquashfs /home/bodhi/rootfs custom/casper/filesystem.squashfs\n\n2) Understand isolinux - this makes the iso bootable, as well as your CD (boot) menu. See Arch Linux Wiki syslinux.\nYou can use grub2 as an alternate to isolinux, but then you will need to understand how grub2 works ;) . Most live CD are still using isolinux.\n3) How to make an initramfs. The initramfs is a second file system , used to boot. Often when you are having a problem (custom boot image not working, kernel modules not loading), and you can not understand why looking at your root file system, the answer is very likely in the initramfs.\n#extract to a working_directory , I use ~/initrd\ncd ~/initrd\nlzma -dc -S .lz ../initrd.lz | cpio -imvd --no-absolute-filenames\n\n# Make your edits / adjustments\n# Package\ncd ~/initrd\nfind . | cpio --quiet --dereference -o -H newc | lzma -7 > ../custom.initrd.lz\n\nYou then move your new initrd.lz to your custom build directory, custom/casper/initrd.lz\n4) casper. Casper, and the casper scripts are located in 3 locations,and all 3 can play a role. They are all bash scripts, and at some point you will almost certainly want to look through them.\nA. host - /usr/share/initramfs-tools/scripts/casper\nB. root file system - custom/usr/share/initramfs-tools/scripts/casper\nC. in the initramfs - See the /scripts directory.\nSee Ubuntu man casper\n5) You make customizations to the user interface / applications in /usr/share, /usr/share/gnome* for example, exact locations vary with release, /usr/share/gnome-background-properties/ubuntu-wallpapers.xml is a classic and fairly standard across versions.\n6) If you can not make customizations in /usr/share/, use /etc/skel , here /etc/skel/.bashrc is a classic, that file gets copied to ~/.bashrc . You can put various confg files there, for firefox or gnome or what not, but /usr/share is better if at all possible (varies by setting).\n7) mkisofs - you use mkisofs to convert your build directory to an iso\ncd ~/custom\nsudo mkisofs -D -r -V \"$IMAGE_NAME\" -cache-inodes -J -l -b isolinux/isolinux.bin -c isolinux/boot.cat -no-emul-boot -boot-load-size 4 -boot-info-table -o ../ubuntu-12.04-custom.iso .\n\n8) Persistence. You can use persistence with many live CD, including the ubuntu-desktop cd and a custom cd, this is implemented by casper.\nA. root - casper will mount a partition or file labeled as casper-rw as a cow overlay on / . If you then install a package, or modify a config file, the changes will persist over a reboot.\nUse this sparingly. If you update all the packages, it will take a lot of space. I also find that this method is sometimes buggy.\nB. Home - casper sill mount a partition or file labeled aas home-rw as a cow overlay on /home.\nI prefer this as my firefox bookmarks and private data will be preserved across boots and I find it more reliable.\nPersistent home (change to casper-rw for a persistent / )\n# this is a 1 Gb file, increase or decrease the count to make it larger or smaller\ndd if=/dev/zero of=home-rw bs=1M count=1000\n\n# make a file system\nmkfs.ext4 home-rw\nmke2fs 1.41.14 (22-Dec-2010)\nhome-rw is not a block special device.\nProceed anyway? (y,n) y <-- ANSWER 'y' here\n\n#tune the file system to remove reserved blocks and label it 'home-rw'\ntune2fs -m 0 -L home-rw home-rw\n\nPut home-rw in / (in the root directory of a partition) or onto a flash drive (not in a sub directory). \nWhen you boot the live CD, hit the F6 key, they Esc, add the option persistent to the boot parameters, in front of the '--'\nquiet splash persistent --\n\nThe casper boot scripts will then find an mount it automatically.\nSee Ubuntu wiki Persistence - The ubuntu wiki page only discussed casper-rw, but home-rw is referenced in the casper scripts and works the same way, only the name has been changed.\nSee This post on the Ubuntu forums for a screen shot walk through (although with different options).\nC. You can enable persistence with several of the graphical tools, unetbootin for example. The graphical tools (as far as I know) use casper-rw.\nOK, now once you understand all that, these two pages will start to make more sense\nUbuntu wiki live cd from scratch\nUbuntu wiki customize live CD\nGoogle\nYou will need to google. You will find fragments of advice all over the internet.\nExample : How to change Live CD splash screen\nDebian Live\nNow that you understand all that, use the Debian Live scripts. Do not let the name fool you you, these scripts work just fine on any .deb system, including Mint and Ubuntu.\nTo install\nsudo apt-get install live-build\n\nThere is a graphical interface\nsudo apt-get install live-magic\n\n\nUnderstand that the live-magic gui may fail, just as remastersys and other guis fail. In that event, you fall back to the  live-build scripts (live-magic will generate a build directory).\nIt takes a while to learn the live-build scripts and the directory layout/structure\nSee the Debian Live Manuel Aye, it is long, just work through it one iso at a time.\nThe advantage of the live-build scripts, once you understand the components of a live CD, the scripts automate 90+ % of the build, and making a change is a simple edit to a config file (usually) or sometimes building a initramfs.\nToo long\nIf that was too long for you, take a deep breath, relax, and work though the information one part at at time. I promise it will start to make some sense and you will find the time is well worth it.\nIf you start with another tool set, come back to this set of tools and after a few iso you will appreciate this set of instructions ;)\nMy custom 12.04 build, it supports the gma500, 2d only (no 3d) out of the box (will be making the iso publicly available to the gma 500 crowd in the next few days).\n\n", "Q: Lost password after installing and configuring AFS in the system I just installed ubuntu 11.10 on my computer, my problem is that after I configure the afs client , I lost my admin password and root password.

A common one is nomodeset, which is needed for some graphic cards that otherwise boot in to a black screen or corrupted splash, acpi_osi= to fix lcd backlight and other problems, and noapic and nolapic to work around various ACPI BIOS issues. In this how to I will explain briefly what this is and how to do it.\nThis how to applies to ubuntu 10.04 and 10.10. It may not apply to wubi, I dont know how to do it in wubi.\n(update, see post #8 for the differences with wubi)\nWhat are these options?\nnomodeset\nThe newest kernels have moved the video mode setting into the kernel. So all the programming of the hardware specific clock rates and registers on the video card happen in the kernel rather than in the X driver when the X server starts.. This makes it possible to have high resolution nice looking splash (boot) screens and flicker free transitions from boot splash to login screen. Unfortunately, on some cards this doesnt work properly and you end up with a black screen. Adding the nomodeset parameter instructs the kernel to not load video drivers and use BIOS modes instead until X is loaded.\nNote that this option is sometimes needed for nVidia cards when using the default \"nouveau\" drivers. Installing proprietary nvidia drivers usually makes this option no longer necessary, so it may not be needed to make this option permanent, just for one boot until you installed the nvidia drivers.\ncontinue reading\n\nA: Please navigate to the file via gksudo nautilus( in the terminal) Now you can change the file, and save it.

So, it is not that I only have one workspace. \nSo, how to make the workspace switcher work?\n\nA: \nThe workspace switcher in unity (3d) is provided by the compiz plugin \"expo\".

Being a web developer I would like to install Apple Safari to check the proper working of my code. \nBut I'm not getting how to install the Apple Safari on Ubuntu without Wine.\n\nA: You can install it via PlayOnLinux too\n\nA: There is no native Safari for Linux, so your choices are either use the Windows version and run it with Wine or in a VirtualBox, or maybe run it with OSX in a VirtualBox.\nYet another option would be to use another WebKit-based browser such as Chromium or Konqueror as a \"close enough\" approximation of Safari - they do run natively on Linux but, well, they're not Safari :)\n\nA: There is no Debian package or any other linux package available for Ubuntu. Your only chance to use Safari on Ubuntu is use WINE.\n\nA: BrowserStack\nOne option not mentioned in the answers here are web solutions like www.browserstack.com, which let you view your sites/pages through a plethora of browser, display and OS combinations and versions.

I'm tired of pressing and holding CONTROL key in Ubuntu 11.10 when selecting multiple items, Is there any way to get checkboxes to my documents and directories as in versions of Windows? \n\nA: The checkboxes or something similar in Nautilus was planned a long time ago according to wiki: https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Ayatana/DoubleClick\nBut it was not implemented yet.\nIt is possible out of the box in Dolphin file manager but it's part of KDE, not GNOME/Unity.\n\nA: AFAIK, you can't make nautilus, the default Ubuntu file manager to use checkboxes. But you can install some other file manager that does.\nI don't use alternative file-managers, but in this article list 20. Some of then can use checkboxes, although most don't by default. In those that are two-panels, you can usually use space to select more than one file.\nThere is also check Marlin. It's a nautilus fork, aimed at simplicity and ease of use, so they aren't going to use checkboxes, but it's quite popular.\n\nA: Dolphin (KDE) have the feature, but it's implemented differently when you hover a file you have a + or a - to select/deselect the file very productive feature to manage files \n", "Q: While installing Ubuntu, It asked me to allocate something called Swap Space, What exactly is it? While installing Ubuntu, It asked me to allocate something called Swap Space, What exactly is it? What would happen if i dont allocate it?/ What is the use if i did allocate?\n\nA: Swap space is space on the disk used as if it was temporary memory (RAM). If you did allocate it, your computer would use it when its RAM is starting to be used up. If you don't allocate it, nothing happens unless you run out of RAM space. Then any program wanting more RAM would be closed. \nIf you want to use hibernate, you need at least as much swap as you have RAM. This is because when your computer hibernates, it copies the RAM to the swap and turns off.\nAs binW says, swap is slower than RAM.\n\nA: It is a virtual memory space which is used for hibernation, intensive memory processes and general memory consuming applications. To see details of your swap partition just run at the terminal:\ncat /proc/swaps \n\nSwap is used by the kernel of your system whenever it really needs it. Swappiness is a term which refers to the tendency of the kernel to move processes out of physical memory (hardware RAM) to the swap disk. To change the default tendency of your system run at the terminal:\ngksudo gedit /etc/sysctl.conf\n\nand change the variable:\nvm.swappiness=10\n\n \n\nA: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/SwapFaq\nIf you hibernate then as far as I know you'll need swap to do so.\n\nA: in addition to answers already submitted, please note that access to HDD where swap is really in, is much slower than access to data in real RAM. Access to hdd is measured by millisecond whereas access to RAM is measured in microsecond. \n", "Q: Why are some applications so hard to find in the Ubuntu Software Centre? Some applications don't pop up in the search even when you type in their name. Take for instance Sushi. When you type in \"sushi\" into the search box, it fails to throw up the application. Only when you type in \"gnome-sushi\" does it appear. This is despite the fact that the application has \"sushi\" by itself in the application description. There are other applications which don't spring to mind right now, but I've discovered before.\n\nA: They are hidden because they are marked as technical packages - the ones with no .desktop file (see How does Software Center determine what is a \"technical item\" and what isn't? ). You can use Show # technical items link in the bottom left corner to see them.\n\nA: Some packages are not the name of the application itself. Take the example of the \"Sushi\" application, it was meant for Gnome and thus the package itself is prefixed by \"gnome-\", furthermore, it is a technical package and in order to see them in  searches you must click the \"Show X technical packages\" button down in the bottom-left corner of the Ubuntu Software Center window.\n", "Q: Can't use laptop display?

(I am able to schedule torrents, that's not a problem), I don't want my computer always plugged in to a power supply.\n\nA: I've written an application to schedule startup, it's called Wake on Plan.\nIt's not available in the official repository yet (review pending) but you can start using it from PPA: \nhttps://launchpad.net/~xintx-ua/+archive/wakeonplan\n2014-2015 Update:\nI've created the QML version with Ubuntu SDK using phone as a target and hoping for easy porting to desktop over a year ago.

Right now even snappy list -uv crashed on my 15.04x64 installation and it doesn't look ready at all. Or you can try building a deb packages yourself, I'll try to help as much as I can.\n\nA: For a one-time shutdown you can use\nshutdown -h 02:00\n\nTo schedule it you can use cron. There are some GUIs for it like gnome-schedule.\nBut to start machine on schedule you have to look at BIOS/UEFI settings.\nUpdate: check the answers about MythTV and Wake on Plan below to schedule startup.\n\nA: MythTV is able to shut down computer when it's no longer in use and wake it up a few minutes before the next recording starts. It does it by using ACPI functions to set wakeup time before shutting down. There is an extensive howto on configuring this, which basically boils down to:\nFirst verify that your Linux kernel is 2.6.22 or newer and the HWclock update function has been disabled as described above.\nSimple test to wake the machine 5 minutes from now\nsudo sh -c \"echo 0 > /sys/class/rtc/rtc0/wakealarm\"\nsudo sh -c \"echo `date '+%s' -d '+ 5 minutes'` > /sys/class/rtc/rtc0/wakealarm\"\ncat /sys/class/rtc/rtc0/wakealarm\n\nCheck\ncat /proc/driver/rtc\n\nThis should return a list of parameters. Check the \"alrm_time\" is 5 minutes into the future and the \"alrm_date\" is today.\nShutdown your computer and see if it comes back up in ~5 min.\nsudo shutdown -h now  \n\n(in Ubuntu 10.4 \"sudo shutdown -P now\" (-h may cause system to restart))\nOf course, if you always need to shut the computer down at the same time and wake it up at the same time, you can just configure wake-up time in bios (if there's such an option) and schedule a shutdown right from init scripts\n\nA: Use a cronjob to auto sleep and auto resume. The command below will put the the computer to sleep at 02.00 AM and start the machine 4 hours later (14400 seconds)\n00 2 * * * root /usr/sbin/rtcwake -m off -s 14400\n\n\nA: I'm using an older Ubuntu 10.04.4 LTS system, and I have had some success with the rtcwake command.  Use it like this on the command line:\n# wake the system in 1 Hour:\nsudo rtcwake -s 3600 -m disk\n\nThe -m disk option should put it in a low-power state, and depending on hardware support (i.e.: your own computer),  you might even be able to successfully use -m off to fully power off.  \nAlso, you can put the above into the /etc/crontab to schedule it automatically every day.\n\nA: You can use shutdown command to schedule a shutdown. To shutdown at 2 AM you can use the following command:\nsudo shutdown -h 2:00\n\nYou will need to run this command in terminal and leave the terminal open.\nRegarding startup, I dont think that it is possible for Ubuntu or any app running on it to switch on a computer. You will need hardware assistance for this for example you can use Wake on Lan.\n\nA: I suggest this command in your cron:\ndbus-send --system --print-reply --dest=org.freedesktop.UPower /org/freedesktop/UPower org.freedesktop.UPower.Suspend\n\nThis does not need root.\n", "Q: How to use Unity's global menu in GNOME Shell, if possible?

So, while this is not exactly what you want, it still may help a little.\nI would suggest you install Gnome-Shell extension Window List (it is written for Linux Mint 12 Lisa and now available for Ubuntu in the WebUpd8 Gnome3 PPA). This extension shows buttons on the panel (on the top panel if the bottom panel, another their extension, is not installed or disabled) for all applications open in the current workspace only (open and minimized). They have application icons and title.\nThese buttons work as expected: when you click an unfocused application button, it brings it on top, when you click a button for the currently focused application, it minimizes it. When you switch the workspace, it shows the buttons for the applications on the new workspace.\nThis way you will have \"Alt-Tab\" list of applications on the current workspace always visible and at your hands. The only problem is that there is no shortcut to switch between them, you have to use mouse.\nThis is, probably, the best I could suggest for you at the moment.\n", "Q: Failed to fetch because of size mismatch error while upgrading When I try to install updates from the update manager it says:\nFailed to fetch http://us.archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/pool/main/l/linux/linux-image-3.0.0-13-generic_3.0.0-13.22_i386.deb  \nSize mismatch\n\nI have tried several times and through terminal too but the size mismatch repeats itself there too.

The search field in the Path Finders upper right corner isn't searching your whole HD, it's not searching in all the sub folders of a given directory (like in Nautilus). It's just filtering the content of the folder you have currently opened without looking in to the subfolders.\nIs there something similar (plugin, extension, etc.) available for Nautilus?\nTwo users have already asked the same question, but the answers obviously missed the point.\n\nA: I think Nautilus should allow the user to filter the contents of a folder as much as wanted, but here's something that might be of use for you:\nPress Control+S (or Edit > Select items matching) and you can filter contents with basic REGEX.\n\nA: Just like @fader said: Just press search button and there you can choose do you want to search that folder or all files.

You are warned that this is happening by a pop-up message.\nFor the Unity interface, there is a silent \"fallback\" to Unity 2D (i.e. no pop-up message).  See the linked question below as to how to determine if you are using Unity 3D or Unity 2D.\nAs to why you possibly are using Unity2D without knowing it - this is likely to be due to your graphics card and/or drivers - I've linked to a question below how you can determine if you have Unity 3D support.\n\nLinked Question:\n\n\n*\n\n*Am I using Unity or Unity 2D?\n\n*How do I tell if Ubuntu supports hardware-accelerated graphics on my laptop?\n\nA: Install Confity A.K.A Configure Unity from Software Center \nClick on Panel and reduce Opacity to Zero.

It features DTD/XML\nSchema/RELAX NG validation, XSLT, XPath, pretty-printing, syntax\nhighlighting, folding, tag completion/locking, and a spelling/style check.\nsisu\nSiSU is a lightweight markup based, command line oriented, document\nstructuring, publishing and search framework for document collections.\nand commong programs like scribus, libreoffice that although not similar will do the work.\nNot found in the official Repos of Ubuntu you also have: http://www.syntext.com/products/serna/ (SERNA) which can be installed and is similar to XMLSpy.\n", "Q: How can I rotate a video? Is there a way to change the rotation angle of a video file?\nI have a couple of videos in the wrong direction so all I wanted is to correct it.\n\nA: If you are asking for rotate a video 90º or 180º, you should use avidemux.\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get install avidemux\n\n\n\n*\n\n*open the video in avidemux\n\n*select a new video format and don't choose copy\n\n*Under \"Video\" click on Filters\n\n\n*\n\n*Choose \"Transform\" and scroll down until you see rotate.\n\n*Add it\n\n*select the right angle\n\n*select preview\n\n*ok.\n\n\n*Go to file\n\n*save\n\n*save video \n\n\nAnd you're done.\n\nA: The best option (in my opinion!) is OpenShot, you simply follow these easy steps:\n\n\n*\n\n*Start OpenShot\n\n*On the File Tab, Import the video file you need to rotate\n\n*Drag the imported video to the timeline field at the bottom (either one will do!).\n\n*Once the videoclip is in the timeline field, right click on it and choose rotate to\nthe desired angle\n\n*Then on the File Tab choose Export video and set the prefered format and location\nto it!\n\n*And presto!! That's it\n\n\nA: OpenShot crops the video when rotated from landscape to portrait. To compensate, I tried these steps and it worked. Hope it works for you too. \n\n\n*\n\n*place video on a track, right click and select properties\n\n*Under videos tab, uncheck \"maintain aspect ratio\" and \"stretch full screen\"\n\n*Under videos tab, put 90 for rotating clockwise, or -90 to rotate anti-clockwise\n\n*Under Layout tab, decrease width % to lower value (say 70) for both \"start of click\" and \"end of clip\". This value should depend upon aspect ratio of shooting, so try accordingly. Mine was 16:9 and value of 70 was fine. \n\n\nIn this way, you would find the video least cropped and it should not be noticeable. \n\nA: A simple tool that can also rotate is transmageddon. Install it with \nsudo apt install transmageddon\n\nthen load your file into it and choose the rotation position\n\n\nA: Do you mean rotation on playback or converting it to a rotated version?\nAs a commandline-user I normally use mplayer:\nPlayback:\nmplayer -vf rotate=1 videofile.mp4\n(rotate can have values from 0 to 7, 1 rotates 90deg clockwise)\nConvert (requires transcoding):\nmencoder -vf rotate=1 videofile.mp4 -oac copy -of lavf -lavfopts format=mp4 -ovc lavc -lavcopts vcodec=mpeg4 -o newfilename.mp4\n(you can use other video codecs as well, this is just an example)\nAnd here is a graphical tool to do the latter: kdenlive (a kde application from the universe)\n\n\n*\n\n*import your video as a clip\n\n*draw the clip into the timeline\n\n*rightclick onto the video chunk in timeline\n\n*select \"Add Effect\" -> \"Crop and Transform\" -> \"Rotate (Keyframable)\"\n\n*The effect can be configured in the upper central section of the window, set X to 900 (thats 90 deg clockwise)\n\n*Render your project (Project -> Render in the main menu)\n\n*Be careful to choose a video resolution for the resulting portrait format\n\n*select any video codec you like, i recommend x264 or vp8 (webm) \n\n\nA: You can also use ffmpeg and the commandline (taken from Rotating videos with FFmpeg):\n\nRotate 90 clockwise:\nffmpeg -i in.mov -vf \"transpose=1\" out.mov\n\nFor the transpose parameter you can pass:\n0 = 90CounterCLockwise and Vertical Flip (default) \n1 = 90Clockwise \n2 = 90CounterClockwise \n3 = 90Clockwise and Vertical Flip\n\n\nAnd to flip it horizontally (ffmpeg documentation):\n\nFlip the input video horizontally.\nFor example to horizontally flip the video in input with `ffmpeg':\nffmpeg -i in.avi -vf \"hflip\" out.avi\n\n\nNota bene 1\nOlder versions of Ubuntu supplied avconv instead of ffmpeg. In this case just change ffmpeg to avconv:\navconv -i in.mov -vf \"transpose=1\" out.mov\n\nNota bene 2\nIf the output is a .mp4 video you has to add strict -2 before the output file to avoid error message :\nffmpeg -i in.mp4 -vf \"transpose=1\" -strict -2 out.mp4\n\n\nA: If you just want to view a movie in a different orientation, as of Totem 3.1.4 (in Raring 13.04 and beyond), there is a \"rotation plugin\" which you can turn on (edit/plugins), and then rotate e.g. via ctrl-r.\nI think proper rotation should be automatic when there is rotation metadata, and I commented on a relevant Totem bug here:  Bug 701950 – Iphone Movies\nThere are also ways to do this in mplayer (and to convert to a rotated movie with mencoder), e.g.\n mplayer -vf rotate file.mov\n\nor\n mencoder file.mov -oac lavc -ovc x264 -vf rotate=1 -o file-rotated.mov\n\n", "Q: How to repair an external Hard-Drive?

Is there a linux way, though?\n\nA: You might want to back everything up, and reformat it to fat32. \nNTFS personally doesn't like me and randomly(I haven't found a way to reproduce properly) will lock me out of my Windows's OS drive; just have to umount and re-mount the drive.\nIf you want you could try NTFS partition, but I find using fat32 much easier because there is no permissions to worry about.\nBTW: Make sure on both operating system's you 'safely remove drive' cause even though it is unlikely that could cause unwanted data on the disk, I've found.\n(a nice GUI partitioning tool I use is Gparted.)\n", "Q: Where are shell/terminal settings stored? I updated my Ubuntu but it crashed during installation and I was not able to recover it (my hard drive crashed). I changed my hard drive and re-install ubuntu\nI saved all my important docs (bookmark, documents etc...) \nOne thing I was unable to recover is the profile from my shell (I changed the color scheme, title, number of lines scrollback etc...)\nWhere can I save this so next time something happens I won't have to set my terminal settings all over again?\n\nA: Newer gnome-terminal (3.8+ I think) stores its config in dconf instead gconf.\ngsettings list-recursively | grep -i org.gnome.Terminal\n\nMore info about the change https://askubuntu.com/a/91409/79266\n\nA: GNOME Terminal profiles are stored in: ~/.gconf/apps/gnome-terminal/profiles. \n(You might want to back up the whole .gconf directory, though.)\n\nA: In case someone lands here looking for a way to change the terminal settings from console (eg for vagrant provisions), the gconftool-2 command can be used. For example:\ngconftool-2 --set /apps/gnome-terminal/profiles/Default/background_darkness --type=float 0.50\n\nYou can get the relevant setting keys from the ~/.gconf/apps/gnome-terminal/profiles/Default/%gconf.xml file.\n\nA: I don't think this will change the gnome terminal background color etc. but it will edit BASH's behavior. The BASH config files for the individual user are stored in the .bashrc file in your home directory. Note that since it is a dot file it is hidden by default. Use ls -a from the terminal to see the file or invoke view hidden files in nautilus to reveal it. There is also a .profile file but it is often easier to keep all your edits in .bashrc.\nNow learning how to config BASH (or other shell) is a whole other topic.\n\nA: If you have a separate /home partition and if u don't format it while installing Ubuntu, all your user settings will remain intact (since all user settings will be stored in /home partition). Its always advisable to create multiple partitions (one independent partition for / so that while reinstall only that partition can be formatted)\n", "Q: Graphical features are quite slow on an HD Radeon 3200 I just got new laptop and it had Windows 7 -preinstalled.

The Thinkpad Edge E525 (AMD A6-3400M with AMD Radeon HD 6520G, product number 12002JG) is in the pole position, but I did not find a review how the hardware works with Ubuntu:\n\n\n*\n\n*Ubuntu certification for Lenovo\nDoes all hardware of the E525 works with Ubuntu (especially 11.10). And if not, what are the issues and is there a solution/workaround?\n\nA: Good news! I dared to buy it before the answer from Cyrilco came in. And Ubuntu 11.10 (alternate, AMD64) works with fine with our Lenovo.\nSo far I only found one minor issue: It does not recognise MMC-cards.\nBut there is probably a problem with the ATI graphic card, but I followed the answer of Isaac Joseph in another question and that helped me through the black screen after installation:  \n\n1) Go here and download the alternate install live CD.\n  2) Boot and install from the alternate LiveCD\n  3) After installation, boot with nomodeset\n  4) Drop into TTY, log in as usual [I had a hard time to find a terminal/command line as the screen was black, so I went through the installation process (with the CD/USB drive) again; at some point, I chose to return and to go to the command line. Probably there is an easier way to do it.]\n  5) Install fglrx: sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install fglrx\n  6) After it's finished, just reboot and boot normally. You should be able to boot into Ubuntu 11.10.\n  Also, I should mention that everything will seem kind of sluggish. If you install compizconfig-settings-manager and turn off \"Sync to Vblank\" in General --> OpenGL, everything will be visibly faster and smoother.  \n\nProbably because of the nomodeset \"no video  mode activated\" appears just after the BIOS loaded.

To avoid this, go to CCSM->Put->Misc.Options, and tick \"Unfocus Window\".\nI use CCSM->Put to move windows to arbitrary viewports without changing current view, and the Ubuntu Settings with arrows to move windows to adjacents viewports and moving the view (following the window) at the same time.\n", "Q: Looking for a linux equivalent to Trans Lucy Trans Lucy for the Mac, allows you to watch video in a semi transparent window, superimposed on top of your other windows.\nYou can continue to work, as all clicks on the area covered by Trans Lucy pass directly to the window below - as if the window wasn't there.\nDoes anyone know of an equivalent for Linux?\n\nA: Just realize that this is not enabled by default in Unity.

I am looking for a Screencast that is at least update recently and that I know that if I keep using it I could count on it being updated.\nThe most important part is video recording but sound is good too. Maybe a window area, mouse tracking, etc. But it needs to be up to date and not abandoned or very old.\nAnd of course that works in 11.10 and has in mind to work in 12.04.\n\nA: Here's a recent I answer I just gave: How to record my screen?.\nI'm also looking into kdenlive for video editing.

I also have one server running Ubuntu Server. Everything works fine.\nThat I want is make this Server a firewall. I supose that I must have two network cards (I actually have them) and connect ISP modem to eth0 and eth1 goes to the switch where are the other machines connected.\nI read about Shorewall but I don't know how to configure it and I can't connect to Internet with the others. My current configuration (LAN works OK, but WAN doesn't) is the following:\nSERVER:\nauto eth0\n\niface eth0 inet static\n\n    address 192.168.1.250\n    gateway 192.168.1.4\n    netmask 255.255.255.0\n    network 192.168.1.0\n    broadcast 192.168.1.255\n\nauto eth2\n\niface eth2 inet static\n\n    address 192.168.1.2\n    gateway 127.0.0.1\n    netmask 255.255.255.0\n    network 192.168.1.0\n    broadcast 192.168.26.255\n\nThe client has as a gateway the IP of eth2.\nWith this configuration, I can't connect to the Internet. If I do a ping to 192.168.1.2 or 250, it replies successfully.\n\nA: How do you get your IP-address from ADSL? With DHCP? or do you have a static IP? eth0 should be configured regarding to what you use to configure IP.\nAs your eth0 config looks now you have a default gateway at the IP 192.168.1.4 and this would be your ADSL connection with this configuration.\neth2 you say is your local network. The problem here is that you have the same (!) IP-network (192.168.1.0) om both interfaces. That means that there is nothing to route for your server. I don't think 127.0.0.1 is a valid gateway either (eth2). You probably don't need any gateway address on your local network. Another mistake is that eth2 has 192.168.26.255 as broadcast address. That is not a valid address on your network 192.168.1.0 you have defined for eth2.\nWhat you have to do is to configure eth0 as it should be. And if your default gateway to the internet is 192.168.1.4 you must not use 192.168.1.0 network on eth2 (local net).\n", "Q: BCM 4306 not recognized after upgrade on a Dell Latitude D600 This is extremely frustrating to me.

There should be a button somewhere on your dell for this.  Toggle and restart. I've had to do this two or three times in the past on new installs but once you get it on it should stay on unless you're dual booting with Windows. Then, you'll have to do this every time you use Windows.  Also, make sure wireless is enabled by clicking on the icon in the upper right hand corner and verifying that \"enable wireless\" is checked.\nProblem is, I don't know if you loaded the drivers from system settings>additional drivers or not.

I would however like to have more control, ability to group multiple feeds would be nice and in general just features that make it easy to track large number of podcasts.\nAlternatives I have looked at so far:\ngpodder: Doesn't look bad, but its focused on download only, not playing podcasts, it gets very slow with large number of podcasts, it makes downloading a big issue with pop-ups and stuff, instead of a thing that happens mostly transparent in the background\nbanshee: Might be a good alternative if it wouldn't be for the lack of simple listview, it only has this awkward iconview that allows no way to sort the podcast episodes\namarok: extremely ugly interface, podcasts seem to be an afterthought, hidden on the left pane with most of the interface being useless, no way to sort episodes after release date, etc.\nliferea: good: support for the whole RSS feed, not just podcasts, bad: support for the actual MP3 is extremely awkward with it being just an attachment\nmiro: doesn't support syncing to MP3 player devices\n\nA: I personally use and prefer gpodder, however as you have issues with it, it looks like you haven tried miro (listed in Synaptic)\n\nA: I find GUI audio players often frustrating, so I usually end up going back to the command line.

Preferably with something in the name that I can later use to filter these cropped copies in Nautilus (unless it saves in another directory, that'd be even better).\n\n*Move to next image and repeat\n\n\nDoes it exist?\n\nA: What you need is ImageMagick which comes pre-instaled with Ubuntu! :)\nconvert -rotate 90 *.jpg\nRead the on the website on how to crop (using the -crop parameter), which will vary depending on how much you want to crop and where to crop.\n\nA: Have you tried digikam?

If you want to remove the inner '.jpg', it would be more easy later in one go with the rename tool (from the perl package):\nrename 's/.jpg.rotate/.rotate/' *.jpg.rotate.jpg \n\nFor rotating, I would use eog (Eye of Gnome) where you have different views on the images, and can easily rotate left/right/180°, and save. But afaik, it doesn't has cropping. \nImage Magick has a GUI interface too, but I don't remember its name, and can't say if it is useful for cropping, if you have different dimensions per image to crop to.\n", "Q: What rules to use for UFW? I've decided to enable the UFW that comes with Ubuntu just to make my system even more secure (especially after watching a video of a person whose computer actually got infected!), and I've enabled UFW and installed GUFW, but I'm not sure what to do next. When I check the status of the firewall, it says that it is active. What are some rules that I should configure to actually make use of the firewall, since right now I'm assuming it's allowing everything, basically acting like it isn't there. \n\nA: See https://wiki.ubuntu.com/UncomplicatedFirewall.\nFeatures\nufw has the following features:\nGetting started with ufw is easy. For example, to enable firewall, allow ssh access, enable logging, and check the status of the firewall, perform:\n$ sudo ufw allow ssh/tcp\n$ sudo ufw logging on\n$ sudo ufw enable\n$ sudo ufw status\nFirewall loaded\n\nTo                         Action  From\n--                         ------  ----\n22:tcp                     ALLOW   Anywhere\n\nThis sets up a default deny (DROP) firewall for incoming connections, with all outbound connections allowed with state tracking.\nAdvanced Functionality\nAs mentioned, the ufw framework is capable of doing anything that iptables can do. This is achieved by using several sets of rules files, which are nothing more than iptables-restore compatible text files. Fine-tuning ufw and/or adding additional iptables commands not offered via the ufw command is a matter of editing various text files:\n\n\n*\n\n*/etc/default/ufw: high level configuration, such as default policies, IPv6 support and kernel modules to use\n\n*/etc/ufw/before[6].rules: rules in these files are evaluated before any rules added via the ufw command\n\n*/etc/ufw/after[6].rules: rules in these files are evaluated after any rules added via the ufw command\n\n*/etc/ufw/sysctl.conf: kernel network tunables\n\n*/var/lib/ufw/user[6].rules or /lib/ufw/user[6].rules (0.28 and later): rules added via the ufw command (should not normally be edited by hand)\n\n*/etc/ufw/ufw.conf: sets whether or not ufw is enabled on boot, and in 9.04 (ufw 0.27) and later, sets the LOGLEVEL\n\n\nAfter modifying any of the above files, activate the new settings with:\n$ sudo ufw disable\n$ sudo ufw enable\n\n\nA: If you've set ufw to enabled then you've enabled the preset rules, so it means ufw (via iptables) is actively blocking packets.\nIf you want more details, run\nsudo ufw status verbose\n\nand you will see something like this\n$ sudo ufw status verbose\nStatus: active\nLogging: on (low)\nDefault: deny (incoming), allow (outgoing)\nNew profiles: skip\n\nwhich basically means that all incoming is denied and all outgoing allowed. It's a bit more complicated than that (for example ESTABLISHED - requested - packets are allowed in), and if you're interested in the full set of rules, see the output of sudo iptables -L. \nIf you have a public IP, you can use an online test to get an idea how good the filtering is, for example www.grc.com (look for ShieldsUP) or nmap-online.\nYou should also see messages about blocked/allowed packets in logs (/var/log/syslog and /var/log/ufw.log).\n\nA: A firewall can provide two quite different levels of protection.\n\n\nONE: -- It can block any external attempt to connect to a given host.\nTWO: -- It can control, limit, and obfuscate any available connections.\n\n\nYou need to start with ONE, and think about TWO later ..\nSTEPS:\nA.

The top row is your active connection. I can manipulate the output to only the second column by doing:\nroute -n | awk '{print $2}'\n\nNow, how can I filter by row?\n\nA: To print a particular line you can use sed:\nroute -n | sed -n 2p\n\nto print second line.\nsed, what is\nI will give a short and incomplete explanation of what is sed. For a complete description I suggest to see sed info pages (run info sed).\nsed mean stream editor, i.e. an editor that can act on a stream (or pipe) of text data, though it can act also on files; substantially this mean that (differently from ed) it can never turn back to a previous line.\nsed, as awk reads one line at a time and apply a script to that line to possibly modify it. At the end of the script, by default the modified line is output to stdout. Then sed go on the the next line.\nA script is a sequence of pair address-command, if the line match the address then the command is executed.\nThe typical use of sed is to perform a substitution of a pattern with something, e.g.\ncommand | sed 's/ *$//'\n\nhere the string between single quotes is the script, consisting of a single address-command pair. The address is missing (it would appear before the s), in such a case the command is applied by default to all input lines. s is the command and the rest of the string are command specific instructions, saying \"substitute 0 or more occurrence (*) of a space ( ) character at end on line ($) with nothing (i.e. remove them)\".\nOther useful command are p and d. The p command print the current line, this is useful in combination with the -n option, that modify the default behavior to print the current line at end of script. So in\nsed -n '2p'\n\nthe script is the string 2p consisting on the address 2 and the command p, so the line 2 will be printed, all other line instead will not be printed, due to the -n option.\nThe d command delete a line, for example\n    sed '3,6d'\n\nwould delete all lines from the third to the sixth. 3,6 is an address range. I observe that in this case one should not use the -n option, because we want to print all other lines.\nLast thing, an address could be a pattern, like in\nsed -n '/^#/p'\n\nthis command would print all lines beginning (^) with a # character.\n\nA: You can filter IN a row by piping to grep and finding a row that starts with your IP address  of interest, for example, if you want to see the row for 192.168.1.1, you would do:\n$ route | grep ^192.168.1.0\n192.168.1.0     *               255.255.255.0   U     2      0        0 wlan0\n\nThe '^' mark means \"line-starts-with'. So you could be more generic with:\n$ route | grep ^192.168.1\n192.168.1.0     *               255.255.255.0   U     2      0        0 wlan0\n192.168.111.0   *               255.255.255.0   U     0      0        0 virbr0\n\n\nA: You can use a regular expression to tell awk what lines you want, e.g.\nroute -n | awk '/^192.168/ {print $2}'\n\nwill output the seconds column of all rows that start with 192.168\n\nA: an awk answer could also look something like:\n$0 ~ ( /matchthis/ ) { print $2 }\n\n$0 simply refers to the whole row/line\nsed and awk can be a very powerful combination\nregular expressions are worth while to master\n", "Q: Where do I file a bug regarding the unlock screen? When you lock your screen, and then try typing your password to unlock it, your wallpaper doesn't obey the \"Fit\" settings (Zoom, Stretch, etc). This is a bug that needs fixing, and I'm not sure where to report this.\n\nA: Assuming you're using one of the GNOME-based interfaces (this includes Unity and Unity 2D), screen locking is provided by the gnome-screensaver package, so you can report it against that package, initiating your report by running ubuntu-bug gnome-screensaver. Of course, you should make sure to read the bug reporting documentation carefully first.\nIf the bug turns out to be in another package (for example, if it's in the way other system components react after you've unlocked the screen), then it can still be changed to that in the bug report, after the bug report is submitted (though you might then be asked to provide additional information).\nIf this pertains to the display of the wallpaper after you have unlocked the screen, and not to anything that happens when the screen is locked or being unlocked, then you should probably report the bug against nautilus instead of gnome-screensaver (as Nautilus provides the desktop background, icons, and contextual menu).\nYou should try to describe the problem in as great detail as possible, and provide a picture of the screen if you can (if you can't take a screenshot because the screen is locked, maybe you have a digital camera...).\n", "Q: Why is ntfs-3g not included anymore by default? Why is ntfs-3g not included anymore in Ubuntu 11.10?\nNow I can't write to my NTFS partition.\nJust curiosity, why the change?\n\nA: AFAIK ntfs-3g is included in the default Ubuntu installation, because the virtual ubuntu-standard package depends on it. You've probably uninstalled it by mistake.\nCheck the output of\ndpkg -l ntfs*\n\nIf you see something like rc for the package, you've uninstalled it.\nEDIT:\nFrom your comments it looks like you installed ntfsprogs. If that is true, then by installing it you automatically uninstalled ntfs-3g, as these two packages are in conflict (in Oneiric). ntfs-3g now provides the functionality of ntfsprogs so it's not needed. \n\nA: NTFS-3G is still included in Ubuntu 11.10. (See information about ntfs-3g in Oneiric here and here.) I am using it on two Ubuntu 11.10 machines at this very moment!\nWhile the NTFS filesystem was developed by Microsoft for use in their proprietary Windows operating system, there is nothing proprietary in ntfs-3g, and ntfs-3g is completely independent of any \"restricted extras\" package.\nntfs-3g is also still installed by default in Ubuntu 11.10. In the very unlikely event that it has become uninstalled, you can reinstall it by installing the ntfs-3g package.\nIf you uninstalled ntfs-3g, you would no longer be able to mount NTFS volumes and write to them. (You would then be using the older NTFS driver which only had experimental--and generally not safe--support for writing to NTFS filesystems.) But in practice, problems mounting and writing to NTFS volumes in Ubuntu are not caused by ntfs-3g being missing--they are caused by other, more subtle, things going wrong. Fortunately, they are rare, virtually always correctable, and usually fixable with relative ease.\nI recommend that you post a new question detailing information about the drive you are having trouble mounting (including its size, make, and model). If this is not an external drive but is instead a partition on the same drive as your Ubuntu system, then specify its size (if you know it or can find out), whether or not it has Windows installed on it and if so what version of Windows, and specifically how you installed Ubuntu. Make sure to indicate if writing to the partition is the only problem you're having, or if you are also unable to mount it and/or read it. If you are able to mount the drive, you should include the output of the mount command (run just like that, with no arguments) in the Terminal.\n\nA: I found out that ntfsprogs has write support for NTFS. And thus it replaces ntfs-3g.\nBut this package is still a bit buggy and sometimes it doesn't work so you can't create new folders and files on the NTFS filesystems.\nSo it is working on a random base xD.\nIn Ubuntu things should be tested more properly. Because they just replaced a working package with a buggy one.\n", "Q: How to auto-start all screenlets in unity only(not Gnome-shell)?

I like to play around with themes and icons to make my desktop looking more lovely. Can I use the themes and icons also for Unity 3D/2D, or what do I have to look for to know when and how I have to use them?\n\nA: First, install GNOME Tweak Tool from the Ubuntu Software Center. \nOnce you download a theme or icon set you'll have to extract the theme or icon set and put it in the right folder. Use gksu nautilus to navigate to the downloaded file then right-click to extract the theme's tar or zip. Then, put that extracted folder in /usr/share/themes if it's a theme or /usr/share/icons if it's an icon set.  After that, open GNOME Tweak Tool and go from there.\n\nA: What themes you can use with Unity depends on the version of Ubuntu you are running.\n\n\n*\n\n*Ubuntu 11.04 or earlier: Use GTK+ 2 themes.\n\n*Ubuntu 11.10 or later: Use GTK+ 3 themes.\n\n\nIf you are running Ubuntu 11.10 or later, you can use the same themes you would use with GNOME 3 (or, more accurately, GNOME Shell). This is because Unity itself is based on GNOME 3 in those versions. Unity in Ubuntu 11.04 and earlier is based on GNOME 2, so it uses a different set of themes.\nIcon sets should be completely compatible with any Ubuntu release under any GNOME-based desktop environment (including Unity). Also, there should be no theme differences between Unity 3D and Unity 2D.\nYou can get themes and icon sets from sites like gnome-look.org or deviantART. After you download your desired theme sets, see How do I change to a theme not listed in the Appearance screen? or How do I get and install more themes, icons, and pointers? for information on how to apply them.\n", "Q: Gnome-shell notifications in the tray gets overcrowded The notification tray at the bottom of my desktop screen gets overcrowded with notification icons after several notify-send messages appear.

Help with something really basic, which I am unable to figure out. In Windows creating a shortcut (link) for a website is as easy as dragging-and-dropping the favicon/address bar to the desktop or a folder.\nI tried the same in Ubuntu (Chrome browser), but it's not working.

Done! \nNote: to drag a link, hover your mouse then click and drag over the far left side of the bar. Drag to the nemo file folder where you want it. Wait a half-second for it to register, then release. Sometimes you have to refresh the folder with F5 or Ctrl + R to get it to show up. \nOne caveat to using nemo as your main file manager in Ubuntu is that the Trash bin in it doesn't work properly! So, whenever you want to retrieve something from the trash or empty the trash, just use the default file manager in Ubuntu, which is nautilus.\nUPDATE: This works in the default nautilus file manager too actually. I guess I just forgot: either it didn't use to work a few years back so I switched to nemo which did work at the time, or I just hate nautilus since it doesn't have a traditional \"Compact\" view like in Nemo on Linux and like the \"List\" view in Windows Explorer on Windows.\n", "Q: How can I edit /etc/skel while keeping the default folders on Live CD I'm making a Live CD with all of the features I need in Ubuntu.

I thought my sister would appreciate it more if it were not via IP address.\nIf there's anymore information needed, let me know.\nThanks in advance!\n\nA: If this is a local network, then you can use hostname.local to access the VM. For instance, if the VMs hostname is st, and you're connecting through a web browser, you can use http://st.local to access it without any setup. This will only be available on the local network. If you would like to change the hostname, that is done by simply editing the file /etc/hostname which only contains the hostname. In order to do so, press alt+f2 and enter gksu gedit /etc/hostname. You'll need to reboot for the change to be used. \nIf this should be available globally, then you'll need to add a DNS server, such as bind, and edit the zone file. You can read more about that here: https://help.ubuntu.com/11.10/serverguide/C/dns.html\n\nA: You can create a user friendly URL by creating an entry on your DNS server that resolves the IP address to the friendly URL of your choosing.

With Ubuntu 10.04 - 11.04, the system would boot into \"multi user\" mode before all \"static\" network connections were available. This is fine for a laptop or desktop, because NetworkManager manages connections in a way where most GUI programs are ready to have their network connection gone. But for servers, this is unacceptable, as some of the network services require there to be a specific network configuration before they start.\nThe failsafe mode is just a way to get the system to continue booting, even if these network interfaces are not available.

I.e., is there a way to backup just the home file system and save the list of things to do from an install disk?\nBesides data loss, I'm more concerned that I try some video driver and decide that I want to go back to my system state before I installed that bad video driver.\n\nA: you are mixing two topics together:\n\n\n*\n\n*filesystem/data backup\n\n*software and system management\n\n\nfor the first part of your question the most common answer in this case is relatively simple and i can suggest to create one or more mount point in different volumes or filesystem partitions as you like. The standard installation profile for Ubuntu provide only a root partition plus a swap space, so when you follow the standard installation wizard you obtain your operative system that uses a total of 2 partition; a better approach can consist in the creation of a third mount point for /home, so all your personal data are stored in a separate disk or in a separate partition, you can do this for all your mount point and you can connect this mount point as you wish, to every and each one hdd in your system or in a separate portion of your hdd. The basic concepts are fairly simple, take a look at docs like this one https://help.ubuntu.com/community/AutomaticallyMountPartitions about fstab and the various mount options .\nthe answer to the second part of your question is more complex and involves a deep knowledge about both software and hardware and is pratically impossible to give a specific answer to a question so generic. For example, there is no \"standard\" approach for a system failure caused by a bad video driver, you have to investigate the failure or you have to know how your software and your hardware works to do the right thing to do.\n", "Q: Why is my Chrome so slow? Chrome became slow. Why is that? Firefox is much faster in Ubuntu, but I prefer Chrome, because it gives more \"space\". Thank you.\n\nA: It's not clear if this is a fresh install with a new profile. But it can happen that any browser's performance can degrade over time for various reasons: for example, conflicting extensions or some file being corrupted in one's profile.\nFirst you could try creating a new \"profile\": with Chrome not running, simply rename the folder that has your details: home/yourname/.config/google-chrome/Default to something else. When you restart Chrome, it will create a new Default. Mostly, this solves most problems. For more details, consult the Linux section in Create a new browser user profile.\n(If you have valuable bookmarks, you could export them as html before creating the new profile and import them later via Chrome's Bookmark Manager.)\nIf the browser performs well with the new profile, it could point to an issue with extensions you had installed. Some ad block extensions are known to affect performance, at least on some pages. If it's a problem with a single extension, all can be disabled and enabled one by one to see when performance degrades. You can get at your extensions by clicking on Customize and Control Google Chrome, Tools, Extensions or by entering chrome://extensions in the address bar and hitting enter.\nYou can also clear cache, cookies, and browsing history by pressing Ctrl + Shift + Delete together and making appropriate choices.\nIf you provide more details, someone may have specific guidance.\n\nA: i think if you remove browser history and try to reinstal, it will work quite a bit faster...\ndit the trick for me :)\n\nA: use click and clean extension. It clears all cache during exit.\n", "Q: How do I pass \"ACPI=OFF\" to my kernel on boot? When I tried to upgrade from 11.04 to 11.10 the system froze, so I've been playing around with a couple other linux builds (Fedora, Mint, and Puppy) the last couple days and I keep coming around to the same problem: a lockup during boot; each build referencing a kernel error.

For the most part, things are fine. I have issues with the 64-bit version, but who doesn't. \nMy question is whether doing the upgrades for that many versions contributes to the bugs that I see. \nI went from 10.10 to 11.04 by using the built-in upgrade process. From there, I went to 11.10 with the same process. \nI seem to get various DNS errors (such as trying to go to facebook sends me to a server that has nothing to do with facebook.) This doesn't seem to happen on my Windows (work) or MacBook (notebook) computers. \nI've been thinking of doing a clean install with the hopes that it will solve some of the issues I see.

That way, they can show you ads and make profit. The huge downside is that every DNS request succeeds from your computer's point of view. Therefore, there is no clear fail on a DNS, which leads to problems.\n\nA: As queueoverflow stated, there is a service comcast uses which sends you to ad pages on DNS failures.\nI got around this by not using Comcast DNS.  In NetworkManager, I configured my ethernet and wifi interfaces to have 8.8.8.8 and 4.2.2.4 as my DNS servers.\nIn the resolv.conf, you'd simply have\nnameserver 8.8.8.8\nnameserver 4.2.2.4\nSince, though, your resolv.conf is generated by network manager you'll have to edit whatever interface you are using, go to the IPv4 tab, set it to \"IPv4 addresses only\", and under \"DNS Servers\" enter 8.8.8.8,4.2.2.4.\nTHis will also nix the search domain and what not, but will enforce those DNS servers only.\n", "Q: How do I install Zimbra Desktop?

If I click on the icon with the mouse, then it stops jiggling and switches to the requested window.\nWhat is this behavior? I haven't seen any mention of jiggling icons in Unity. I don't understand the original purpose of this, and I'd like a way to fix it so that I won't have to use the mouse.\nEDIT: I get that this is a bug, but someone must have had to code that jiggling effect. What is it used for? Is it some relic of old behavior, or something new that hasn't been implemented yet, what?\n\nA: Unfortunately this is a bug, so there's not much you can do about that other then filing a bug report. But, you can enable the Super(Window Key) + Tab switcher which does the same thing, switches between applications. I will show you how to enable the Super Key + Tab switcher in Ubuntu 11.10. \n1. Open the Ubuntu Software Center.\n\n2. In the search box in the upper right hand corner, type in \"Compiz Config Settings Manager\". Click on the result for the program, then click install.\n\n3.

Have fun with your new switcher!\n\n\nA: For some reason, my answer was converted into a comment. However, I will answer your edit.\nThe jiggling behaviour is intended to indicate that an application needs your attention, but is not in focus. This is how it works in Unity 3D, and, when everything is in working order, in Unity 2D as well. Probably what is happening is that the application is being given \"focus\" but not being raised.\n", "Q: Graphics card recommendation for dual-HD output? I'm wanting a dual HD monitor desktop.

This means that you cannot login as Root directly or use the su command to become the Root user. However, since the Root account physically exists it is still possible to run programs with root-level privileges. This is where sudo comes in - it allows authorised users (normally \"Administrative\" users; for further information please refer to AddUsersHowto) to run certain programs as Root without having to know the root password.\nThis means that in the terminal you should use sudo for commands that require root privileges; simply prepend sudo to all the commands you would normally run as Root.\nBasically boils down to this: \nUse gksudo=GUI applications  \nUse sudo=CLI applications\n", "Q: How to install ubuntu without any extra packages that are currently installed by default?

I was wondering how can I install normal Ubuntu working version on a device that has an ARMv7 processor?\n\nA: Do you mean ARM7 or ARMv7?\nIf the former, I don't believe you can - not with Ubuntu. Other distros might though. Debian certainly supports ARM11, and maybe older. Gentoo might also, and if not you can probably rebuild it so most of the software works, assuming the kernel is OK.

I usually do not play on Linux, I reserve this to Windows.\nI have made a selection of laptop, including the possibility to switch to Macbook Pro. I absolutely want a matt screen (not glossy) My preference is going to Asus N55SF-S2190V with Optimus and Sony Vaio SE1V9E (AMD Radeon HD 6630M) and they have this Hybrid system for the graphic card.\nMy questions:\n\n\n*\n\n*Concerning the Vaio serie S with the AMD Radeon HD 6630M, is there\nalso the same problem with Ubuntu as with the Optimus system ?\n\n*One of the solution that I see is that I will not use probably the nVidia/AMD graphic card for the my work, i will use it for game under windows. After the installation of Ubuntu, which card is detected : the Intel or the NVidia/AMD ? I am thinking to have the dual boot and use the Intel graphic card on Linux and the other one while I am under Windows for playing game/video etc..\n\n*Does the discrete graphic card nVidia/AMD consume power when it is not used under Ubuntu (without installing Bumblebee)\n\n*Then, once Bumblebee is installed, how goes the autonomy ? I imagine that the automony is going down while switching on the dedicated card, but what about when it is switched off, ie when ubuntu uses only the Intel graphics card with Bumblebee?\n\n\nI am not against to write command lines in the terminal but I am not a linux expert, I use it for my work because it is really practical and free.\nThank you in advance.\n\nA: In my experience (Asus U30) when you install Ubuntu in a laptop with Optimus technology the two cards will be detected, but only discrete card will be effectively used. The dedicated card, although not being used its turned on, so it will drain power. Bumblebee let you use the dedicated card, but not in the same way it is used in Windows(no automatic switching between cards) and lets you turn off it to save battery (but this is something experimental...).\nAlso please note that some laptops with Optimus let users turn on and off the dedicated card in BIOS.\n", "Q: How to know that an app uses which proxy settings There are applications which don't work over proxy.

This question is not only for me but also for many people whom I help. I cannot be sitting with them all the time. I need to tell them how to proceed.\n\nA: Well I would say, if the application is tied closely to GNOME (or any of the libraries closely related to GNOME), then it will use GNOME proxy settings.\nIf it is something to do with the package management stuff, then it will search in apt.conf\nAnd finally, if it is a CLI utility, the bash variables or a configuration file.\nIt's useful to check the app's documentation/manpage to know where does it look for the settings.\n", "Q: Bad quality in Cheese Webcam Booth Software I installed Cheese Webcam Booth from Software Center to 11.10, Cheese worked beautiful in 11.04 but in .10 the image is so bad (ive put a pic of it), i like the functionalities of it and dont want to use any other webcam softwares, Is there a way to fix it? \n\nA: Why don't you give a try on other webcam softwares? guvcview and camorama are good alternatives.

I have been testing with Lubuntu and have found it really pleasant.  However, I cannot find an answer for one essential (for me) feature: being able to arrange windows with keyboard shortcuts.\nIn Ubuntu this is done with the \"Grid\" plugin in \"compizconfig-settings-manager\". Unity uses this as well for window arranging.\nI am not interested in the \"drag to the left to take up 1/2 the screen\", but rather just the \"hit some key combo\" to put the active window to the left 1/2 of the screen, for example.\nI found this entry in \"askubuntu\" asking a very similar question:\nIs there a way to make Openbox behave like the Compiz Grid plugin?\nBut it seems the \"answer to this question\", namely pyTile (http://sourceforge.net/projects/pytile/), doesn't do what I would like it to do.  I don't want to tile all current windows, I want to resize one window at a time as I specify (left, right, top, center, bottom, 1/2, 2/3, 1/3, etc.). And I would prefer to do so with the keyboard.\nI think it possible to install compiz in Lubuntu, but this seems like \"overkill\" for this one feature (Grid keyboard shortcuts).  Any help out there?  It would REALLY MAKE MY DAY!!!\n\nA: LewisTM over on ubuntuforums.org gave a great reply that solves all my problems:\n\nIf you want to keep your window\n  manager and emulate the grid fucntionality, you can try PyWO - Python Window Organizer. It can be controlled with the keyboard.\nCheers!\n\nI had first tried installing compiz, but it made all sorts of problems as the lxde panel sort of had problems, keyboard shortcuts (like ctrl alt t) stopped working, etc. It really caused issues.\nThis python script does everything I need it to! Highly recommended.\n", "Q: Auto discovery of DAAP share through SSH tunnel I got a remote machine (somewhere else on the internet) serving my music via DAAP through forked-daapd.\nI SSH to the remote machine, tunnelling remote port 3689 to local port 3689 (which is the default DAAP port).\nOn the local machine, when I start Rhythmbox, it doesn't auto discover the \"local\" DAAP share. I'm able to add it manually, but that's a tedious task, as I have to do it every time I start Rhythmbox.\nMy question is: What do I need to do to get Rhythmbox to auto discover the DAAP share?\nAlternatively, is there some kind of Rhythmbox conf file where I can add the DAAP share permanently?\n\nA: I belive daap discovery is a layer2 service. Which means it's broadcast.\nWhich means you have to be on the same network. Just forwarding one port wont \"catch\" the broadcasts.\nYou would have to create a layer2 vpn. This could be done with software like openvpn or vtund. But there has to be simpler ways. \nWhat is it that you really want to do?

I will mention only .deb since it is the official package format and for example installing a .sh or .run program can typically be as simple as (In latest Ubuntu) ./program.sh or sh program.run.\nAlso note that am talking about HOW to install packages IN Ubuntu, not talking about downloading a new installer (Like some Super Cow Software Center Duke Nukem version from sourceforge or something). Only tools that already come in the repositories (In any of the 4 standard ones, main, universe, restricted or multiverse).\nTake into consideration all GUI and terminal ways of doing it, with basic format of doing the installation. With this in mind I am talking for example about Software Center, synaptic, apt-get, aptitude, dpkg, etc... a way to show all tools that are available in Ubuntu to install deb packages.\nNOTE - Forgot, this should be Community Wiki since it will have all ways a user can install/uninstall something. Like a friendly guide on doing that.\nUPDATED question to remove the confusion some are having about sh/run files.\n\nA: Ways to Install & Uninstall .deb packages in Ubuntu:\nSOFTWARE CENTER\nThis is the default GUI installer/uninstaller for Ubuntu to search, install and remove applications.\n\nSYNAPTIC\nThis was the old way which can still be used by installing the synaptic package. It works similar to Software Center with a few differences like installing multiple packages at the same time and other details..\n\nAPT-GET & APT-CACHE\nThis are the default terminal ways in Ubuntu to search, install, update and remove applications.\n\nSearch & Install\n\nRemove an application\n\nRemove an application COMPLETELY (Including config files)\n\nUpdate Repositories\nAPTITUDE\nThis was the old terminal way of searching, installing, updating and removing applications. Can be used by installing the aptitude package.\n\nSearch & Install\n\nRemove an application\n\nRemove an application COMPLETELY (Including config files)\n\nUpdate Repositories\nDPKG\n\nInstalling a package\n\nRemoving a package\n\nPurging a package\nThere are other cases like dselect, PackageKit and GDebi. For Kubuntu you have alternatives like Kubuntu's Adept Manager, newer KPackageKit or Muon.\nAs an alternative to DEB packages you have alien which can installed RPM packages (Not to be confused with Revolutions Per Minute since that would make Fedora really fast ;) )\n\nA: I am a bit confused about this question. Ubuntu has its software sources, which are trusted, and comes with reliable/tested software. By passing this concept comes with security issue's. We have to teach the \"Ubuntu-way\", the software sources are the Achilles heel of Ubuntu. Only very experienced users know their way in the world wide(wild) web, outside the off. software sources. (Via Sourceforge, etc.)\nSome dev's put a nice uninstall how to/in their software readme. (When you are lucky) But sometimes tar.gz's comes with no uninstall readme at all.\nLets not make it fancy or \"interesting\" to install software outside the off. sources. If I didn't understood your input and question Luis Alverdo forgive me.......\n\nA: .run and .sh can do what they like in your system, and there is no way to have any automatic uninstall for them. This is why you should always recommend that users use .deb-files, or if they compile themselves, use checkinstall to create a deb before installing it. That way it can easily be removed afterwards. \nFor .run and .sh-installers, you'll just have to consult the softwares manual. \n", "Q: Using long double functions with gcc I am having a hard time getting Ubuntu's gcc to understand the long double-manipulating functions from math.h, namely sqrtl, cabsl and cexpl.

Is it a missing package? Or is this a problem with the version I'm using (4.6.1 on Oneiric)?\n\nA: The problem is with the order the arguments are passed to the compiler.\nOn Oneiric, the linked libraries have to be called after the name of the source file:\ngcc test.c -lm\n\nThis change and the reasons for it are described in more detail here.\nThe problem does not appear for functions of constant values because gcc has built-in versions of them.

Is there a way to modify this? E.g. let the thumbnail generator spend more time on creating those preview icon symbols?\nThanks\n\nA: The sharp icons are vector graphics. You would need to replace any fuzzy or low-resolution icons with SVGs to have them be sharp in bigger resolutions. You can customize any icon by right clicking and choosing 'Properties'. Then click on the current icon in the window to bring up a file browser to pick a replacement.  \nTo make your own replacements, or to convert low-resolution current icons, you would need a graphics program like GIMP or Inkscape to make SVGs.  \nFor photos, you would need to manually create an SVG of each one individually to have sharp thumbnails at bigger sizes. \nTry resizing a few of the default icons on your desktop. Some are really sharp at any resolution, some are not. The sharp ones are vector graphics.\n", "Q: Where is the place where actual size of desktop icons is stored?

For something simple like a slight modification from the original it should be easy. But your volcano might be a bit more complicated but easy to try out: and low risk since you are not modifying a script. \nI used inkscape to see how each part would look and hid the different png layers.\nI guess it goes without saying that the easiest way to do this is to run sudo inkscape in the file:///lib/plymouth/themes/xubuntu-logo/ folder, backup the images and modify them keeping the same name the images . \nHope it helps. \n\nA: Try Synfig Studio or Pencil.\n", "Q: Can I change a linux swap partition to a file system without losing data? so I am using ubuntu 11.10, just changed from windows to ubuntu, and one of my file systems, I accidentally set it up as a linux swap partition and now I want to acces my files, as I did in windows, but I do not know any secure way to change that partition to a file system without formating it and loosing the data. \nBecause I do not want to loose the data I have there.

I then loaded nvidia-settings and configured the monitors as I wanted after a restart to activate the drivers.\nAfter restarting, the 24\" monitor showed a blank white screen (what is apparently a blank X Display) and the other monitor continued to work.

I'm struggling :S\n\nA: Use TwinView or Xinerama to drag windows between displays (if you use Xinerama with Nvidia drivers, you can't run Compiz as it disables OpenGL support). Try TwinView mode.\n\nA: If you have a blank X screen where you can move your mouse, but there are no windows and the cursor is an X, it means that no window manager is running there.\nI used the latest drivers from the official Nvidia page.

Which one does G++ use?\n\nA: g++ is the C++ compiler of the GNU Compiler Collection (GCC).\nThe compiler itself does not come with any OpenGL library.\nYou download OpenGL development libraries from the repository then you compile your program.\nTo get the OpenGL development library is in the package libgl1-mesa-dev. It has support for OpenGL 2.1 and some of the extensions from OpenGL 3. The next version of Mesa will likely support OpenGL 3.\nTo fetch it run sudo apt-get install libgl1-mesa-dev.\n\nA: This does not actually depend on your compiler, but on the type of OpenGL library you are using. On *ubuntu, you may want to use the free mesa library, which is availiable in the package repositories (look for libgl1-mesa-dev). I recommend installing the freeglut package, which additionally provides some really good tools working with opengl.\nAccording to the release notes, mesa currently (v. 7.11) supports OpenGL 2.1 as well as some extensions from level 3 and 4.\nAlso, make sure that your graphics card supports the version of the standard. While OpenGL 3 is supported by most graphics cards today, OpenGL 4 is only available on modern cards.\n\nA: I'm thinking there are no OpenGL1; 2; 3; 4..\nI only now OpenGL; OpenHL; OpenCL; OpenAL; OpenClusterGL; OpenXL.\nBut: Open__ is only a special 3D-Renderer. So you can config it whit the videocart-driver.\nI'm not shure and information are from the Internet, so.....NO WARANTY!!!\n", "Q: Windows gets progressively slower over time, why doesn't Ubuntu? I, and many other previous Windows users notice that the computer seems to get progressively slower over time. I bought a leapfrog crammer only to find it installed process that sat there waiting for me to plug the crammer in so it could run the software. It took up three percent of the CPU twenty-four seven, seven day a week! This is one of the main reasons I left Windows. But, Ubuntu doesn't seem to slow down over time at all. Does Ubuntu allow programs to install background programs like the leapfrog crammer did to sit there like a leech and suck away at resources? Could someone explain why Windows tends to get slower over time, and is Ubuntu vulnrable to this too? Thanks for any help, this is puzzling me.\n\nA: I actually brought this up once to a Microsoft employee who was giving a special presentation on touchscreen technology and how Microsoft planned to approach it, and the best response she could give me was along the lines of \"the slowdown in Windows is due to operating system fragmentation, and we're still heavily researching why this occurs and how to resolve it.\"\nI somehow think the difference may be due to how Ubuntu handles package management and configuration versus Windows' methods, though I wouldn't be able to explain that any further. We may never know completely if we don't have access to Windows' source code to explain why it behaves the way it does.\nThat, and with a new Ubuntu release every 6 months, there may not be enough time in between releases to notice any potential slowdown if you install a fresh copy every time. Or it could also be due to Ubuntu having less bloat, and thus fewer things to go wrong.\n\nA: Windows gets slower because every application comes with an installer that is not controlled very well. For instance the person writing the install script really doesn't care what their program will leave behind when you remove it, because once you've removed it you're no longer a customer. A more pessimistic person would say they do it on purpose to make you upgrade more often, probably not 100% false. \nAlso the registry is a huge issue, hopefully this should get a lot better with SSD's but it's a very centralized point of failure and bottleneck. Every time the system needs hardware info it goes to the registry, every time you launch an application it needs to get info from the registry. When it's first installed the registry is as it should be, as Microsoft expects it to remain. But since anything installing is given nearly free reign over what it does to the registry, and there's no mechanism to remove useless entries the entire thing gets crowded really fast.\nUbuntu is certainly vulnerable to slowing down too, although most applications utilize their own .conf files, with the exception of the gnome configuration file shared by some. However, the way a .deb is structured means whatever goes on the hard drive, can be taken off with the right command. And even IF you don't issue \"apt-get remove --purge ...\" to remove the configuration files, you're just left with a text file in your user directory that doesn't eat up any resources save a few hundred kilobytes of hard drive space. Startup time on Ubuntu can be impacted if you start more services but it employs some tricks, like optimizing where crucial startup components are to minimize hard drive bottleneck. Also, once you're up with Linux, you're up. No waiting for more tray icons to launch.\nEssentially the problem is the registry because it introduces a very real-time bottleneck to many aspects of windows.\n\nA: In my opinion most important reason is that most of the programs on Windows are registry dependent.  Registry is arguably a well organized storage, however it is not known to be a very efficient one. When you first install Windows, registry size is small and look up operations are inexpensive; however as you install more and more programs registry gets larger and harder to manage.\nAnother factor is disk fragmentation. NTFS and FAT are very notorious for their inability to prevent fragmentation. On the other hand Linux file systems, especially ext3 (I do not have any experience in reiserFS or other alternatives) is quite resilient  to fragmentation.\nA short primer on fragmentation\nWhat is fragmentation?  This article does a good job explaining it, but the gist of it is this: Windows clumps all of its files together in one place on the disk, while Linux spreads them all over the place.  That means that, when a file grows on Windows, it runs the risk of being so big that it overlaps the next file's hard disk allocation, and therefore must either be moved or (more likely) fragmented, with the new fragment being stored on a different place on the hard drive.  The next time that file is accessed, Windows actually has to make two disk accesses, one for the initial file and a second for the newly created fragment.  When a file grows in Linux, on the other hand, there is ofter more than enough space for it, and the OS proceeds happily along.  Linux's method does have a small downside on mechanical hard disks, and that is, because the files are spread all over the place, there is a small delay in accessing them over a series of \"clumped\" files.  The e4rat project works rather well for eliminating or reducing some of these delays (ext4 filesystems only), and the incurred overhead is never worse then what Windows experiences from file fragmentation.\nAnother factor is a small trick that Windows pulls: A Windows installation is never up when it's up. Windows starts a lot of processes after you log in. The distinction between system processes and user processes is a little vague for Windows, especially for the old versions before XP. And a lot of Windows applications are very eager to start background processes and place tray icons. In time a Windows installation begins starting more and more processes at start up. However Linux strictly starts all system processes before you log in. After you log in, only a minimal number of processes are started. Linux also never encouraged using background services related to specific tasks of a specific user, or using tray icons. Last version of the Gnome denies all applications to place tray icons, except a very narrow white-list. So in time a Linux installation still starts only a limited number of processes after the start up. \nI'm sure there are other numerous factors that contribute to this phenomenon, these are the major ones that comes to my mind.\n\nA: I think the premise of the question is probably a little hard to substantiate because they are different operating systems with quite different models for installing software so it's hard to do an apples to apples comparison.\nI don't think one can be so general as to say Windows always slows down and Ubuntu never does.\nHere are some things that may possibly cause performance to degrade over time.\n\n\n*\n\n*Disk fragmentation, efficiency of file system, and TRIM\nNote: I don't think fragmentation really contributes to this effect much, I'm just talking about it because a lot of people may assume it does.\nAs disks are used files are written, resized and deleted at random leaving random gaps across the drive. The filesystem needs to efficiently find space for every new file that is written.  This becomes harder and slower once the filesystem becomes more fragmented and there is less free space.  On a traditional hard drive this relates to the physical location of the files on the disk, but on an SSD this is already abstracted by the drive firmware so it relates more to the drive's algorithm for combining writes and keeping track of free blocks.\nOn a traditional HDD it is plausible that later filesystem implementations (like ext4) may be only slightly better at tracking free space and coping with mostly-full drives than earlier implementations of NTFS, but remember that NTFS itself is improving and later OSes like Windows 7, 8 etc have improved algorithms for allocating space even though the on-disk NTFS format they use is essentially the same.\nOn an SSD it'll come down to OS support of TRIM which is a way for the OS to hint to the drive firmware which blocks can be reserved as empty space, drastically reducing the drive's tendency to become slower as it is filled.\nOverall, though, these are pretty small effects and there isn't a great deal of difference between modern versions of Windows and the filesystems Ubuntu uses.\n\n*Crapware, software that runs at boot, etc\nWindows has a much greater problem of \"crapware\" - that is, software that you don't want installed but is bundled with other software, deceitfully or just annoyingly.  With Ubuntu, you typically get all or most of your software packaged specifically for Ubuntu so it doesn't have any commercial reason to bundle \"adware\" and guards against \"spyware\" or other nefarious software.\nOn Windows, you get your software from a wide variety of sources, many of them with commercial reasons for bundling adware (software that pops up ads, changes your browser homepage, adds browser toolbars, adds browser extensions, etc), and some nefarious software bundling spyware.\nThis is probably going to have much more of a real-world effect on Windows getting slower over time, but it can be averted by being very careful about what you install and where you obtain software.\n\n*Poorly coded software, inefficient software\nUbuntu software (referring to software from Ubuntu repositories) all has to be approved by someone at some stage from Ubuntu or Debian before it's included, and its source code is open for all to see, offering a certain level of transparency and ability for people to see any major flaws or silly coding.  In theory this should result in a certain level of reliability and behaviour from software.\nOn the other hand, while Microsoft Windows itself and its bundled software will work pretty well, software written for Windows from third parties varies greatly in quality and efficiency, and there is no body approving or overseeing its production. \nThus, third party software for Windows may use memory inefficiently, it may start when Windows boots even if it probably doesn't need to, and generally run poorly.  On the other hand, some brilliant software will be very slim, fast and efficient.  With a mixture of such good and bad software building up over time as you install more software on Windows, your system will gradually feel the burden, especially for software that loads itself at startup (this isn't a Windows help site but if you're interested in keeping Windows running well, use the excellent \"Autoruns\" tool downloadable for free).\n\nA: I actually think that the virus protection software is the biggest cause of Windows slowdown. At work I have to use a Windows based computer. If you disable the virus software for a day, the computer will run significantly quicker, but it is not an alternative for us. We had an 'infestation' on the network awhile ago and all hell broke loose. There are fewer malware programs that affect Linux, though I have read they are rampant in the Android world.\n", "Q: How to complete remove macbuntu (even by formatting)?

I can even copy the files onto the partition in question (Storage - Disk1/Partition2), and it works flawlessly. However, I cannot see ANY files added by Ubuntu when I boot Windows up. So basically, Windows only sees its own files on the partition, while Ubuntu sees everything.\nIs there something I need to do to make Windows see Ubuntu-made files? Keep in mind that the partition is NTFS, not ext2/3/4, so Windows does see it - just not the files which Ubuntu makes (and Win7 doesn't even take those files into account when calculating leftover free space on said partition - they are completely nonexistant to the OS)\nMy goal is, essentially, to have one Storage partition through which both Operating Systems could share files - thus having music, movies, code samples and downloads all in one place, accessible and changeable by both OS - without having to resort to something like a physically separate network drive.\n\nA: I've never had this problem. Any files I've created in Ubuntu, and placed on an NTFS partition, have always been visible in Windows 7. Are you saving your files (docs, etc) to their normal ubuntu /home partition, and then copying them over to the NTFS partition? Or, do you have a symlink to the NTFS for your files? Either way, you should see the files while booted into Windows. Also, any files in Ubuntu /home will NOT be visible in Windows 7 (ext4 is not recognized by windows).\n\nA: Any NTFS partition is NOT fully stable when written to, when the background 'Windows file manager' is not running.  This is NOT an absolute, as just editing an existing file may not cause a problem.  However, creating a new file or radically changing the size of a file will sometimes cause problems.\nThere is more than one method (for performance advantage?) to add extra NTFS blocks, etc. and Windows may arbitrarily 'assign' a method.  There is also anecdotal evidence that NTFS has changed slightly (and repeatedly) for each Windows service pack (and major release).\nWhen you write to an NTFS partition, and then re-start Windows, this can automatically trigger a CHKDSK run.  This will also occur if you re-size the partition.\nA given implementation of NTFS may not handle a partition in the exact same manner as another.  This still means that an NTFS partition solely under the control of Linux should NOT cause issues.\nnoted elsewhere:\nhttp://www.justlinux.com/forum/showpost.php?p=527739&postcount=3 \nhttp://www.knoppix.net/wiki/Using_FAQ#Q:_How_can_I_write_data_on_NTFS_partitions.3F\nConclusion: Writing to NTFS should be possible, and should cause no issues. However, until better documentation and standards are available this may still cause problems ..\n\nA: The reason was the SRT caching.\nI had it turned on to speed up my Win partition for gaming mostly, and since my caching SSD was 64GB big (current maximum size for SRT) it basically cached everything it got its hands on since it hadn't run out of space yet to start purging. As such, all Windows could see was the cached content, pulled from the SSD, while Ubuntu (since there is no SRT support for it) saw the up-to-date state.\nOnce I turned SRT off and rebooted to purge the cache manually, they communicate with the partition flawlessly. Naturally, this is unacceptable because I need my SRT on the Win OS, so I'll just plug in a new drive to serve as the share disk. That way I have some redundancy as well.\nThanks for the help everyone!\n", "Q: How to Install Ubuntu with MBR? Hello all, I have a very good question and I hope you can help me:\nAs you know there 2 or maybe 3 ways to install Ubuntu, the 2 ways that I know are:\n\n\n*\n\n*Bootable Installation Ubuntu CD/DVD\n\n*Ubuntu Wubi Installer\n\n\nWhen you install from the CD/DVD by logical and previously you should have a free hard drive space or a unpartitioned space for installing Ubuntu and also have Windows OS installed first , the problem is that when you install the GRUB/GRUB2 (Ubuntu or Linux Boot loader) it delete the Windows MBR (Master Boot Record). Wubi dont have problem that, because you installed inside Windows as a App and make a folder in you Windows OS, but Wubi have many limitations like:\n\n\n*\n\n*Disk Space Limitation, some times you what more that 31 GB\n\n*Low Swap Space, you have to re size your Swap space, if you like to use Ubuntu as a Virtualization Environment or Development Enviroment and many more\n\n\nAs I was saying, the installation from the CD/DVD it seems better, it recognizes your PC Hardware very well, it gives proper Swap Space and has more Ubuntu Full experiences plus don't have Wubi limitations like dose above, but if you have a Windows issue like booting up issue, it is harder to solve that windows issue because GRUB doesn't because he already delete the MBR and don't let you pressing the F8 key or enter on Windows System Recovery.\nSo what I want, if it is possible, is this have a Ubuntu Partion (in my case 60GB) but let you boot from the MRB like Wubi instead of GRUB.\nMy system Specs:\n\n\n*\n\n*Dell Studio 1558 \n\n*Ubuntu 11.10 64 bit\n\n*Windows 7 Home Premium 64 bit\n\n\nBelow are more technical System Specs see it from Windows , RAM , Processor and More:\n\n\nA: Hope I'm understanding your question correctly:\nIf you dual boot with Windows 7, installing Grub to the MBR is, in my opinion, the best option. Yes, your typical Windows loader is overwritten, but can easily be restored in case you want to get rid of the Ubuntu installation. As for assigning 60GB for your installation, the Ubuntu installation lets you do that easily.\nIf you ever want to restore the windows loader, just boot up with your Windows 7 recovery disc, assuming you have made one, and go through the typical steps to get to the command prompt. There, type in the following one at a time:\nbootrec /fixmbr\nbootrec /fixboot\n....then reboot\nYour Windows loader is now restored and you can now boot into Windows. From there, you can delete the partitions once used by Ubuntu, and use the emptied space for Windows.\nHope this helps.......\n\nA: There is a software, EasyBCD that does exactly what you're looking for.

How does a journaling file system work and why does it not fragment, like NTFS?\nWhy hasn't Windows switched over to a journaling file system?\nCould someone please explain this to me? Thanks.\n\nA: I'll try to give an extended but simple answer, based on available sources:\nSimple definition of a journaling file system from PC World:\n\nA file system that contains its own recovery capability in the event\nof a failure. In a journaling file system, the information about the\nchanges is recorded in a separate log (the journal) before the indexes\nto the files are updated. If a power or other system failure corrupts\nthe indexes as they are being rewritten, the operating system can use\nthe log to repair them when the computer is restarted.\n\nA little more detail from Wikipedia:\n\nUpdating file systems to reflect changes to files and directories\nusually requires many separate write operations. This makes it\npossible for an interruption (like a power failure or system crash)\nbetween writes to leave data structures in an invalid intermediate\nstate.\nFor example, deleting a file on a Unix file system involves three\nsteps:\n\n*\n\n*Removing its directory entry.\n\n*Releasing the inode to the pool of free inodes.\n\n*Returning all disk blocks to the pool of free disk blocks.\n\nIf a crash occurs after step 1 and before step 2, there will be an\norphaned inode and hence a storage leak; if a crash occurs between\nsteps 2 and 3, then the blocks previously used by the file cannot be\nused for new files, effectively decreasing the storage capacity of the\nfile system. Re-arranging the steps does not help, either. (...)\n(...)\nTo prevent this, a journaled file system allocates a special area—the\njournal—in which it records the changes it will make ahead of time.\nAfter a crash, recovery simply involves reading the journal from the\nfile system and replaying changes from this journal until the file\nsystem is consistent again. (...)\n\nIn addition, ext4 uses some other techniques to reduce fragmentation, namely Extends and Delayed allocation (again from Wikipedia):\n\nExtents\nExtents replace the traditional block mapping scheme used by\next2 and ext3. An extent is a range of contiguous physical blocks,\nimproving large-file performance and reducing fragmentation. A single\nextent in ext4 can map up to 128 MiB of contiguous space with a 4 KiB\nblock size. There can be four extents stored directly in the inode.\nWhen there are more than four extents to a file, the rest of the\nextents are indexed in a tree.\nDelayed allocation\next4 uses a performance technique called\nallocate-on-flush, also known as delayed allocation. That is, ext4\ndelays block allocation until data is flushed to disk; in contrast,\nsome file systems allocate blocks immediately, even when the data goes\ninto a write cache. Delayed allocation improves performance and\nreduces fragmentation by effectively allocating larger amounts of data\nat a time.\n\nI hope this gives the very basic of the operations of journaling filesystems, and specifically some ext4 details.\n\nA: Quoting from PC World Ubuntu Linux, Day 16: EXT4 vs. NTFS:\n\nEXT4 can support individual files up to 16 terabytes, and volumes up\nto one exabyte in size. But, one of the aspects of EXT4 which\ncontributes to better performance, though, is that EXT4 can handle\nlarger extents-a range of contiguous physical blocks of data. This\nallows it to work better with large files and reduce drive\nfragmentation.\nOther factors include the allocate-on-flush technique used by EXT4. By\ndelaying allocation of data blocks until the data is ready to be\nwritten to disk, EXT4 improves performance and reduces fragmentation\ncompared to file systems that allocate blocks earlier.\nUsing checksums for drive journaling improves reliability and improves\nperformance by avoiding waiting on the disk during the journaling\nprocess. When it comes to file checking, EXT4 is quicker because\nunallocated blocks of data are marked as such and are simply skipped\nduring disk check operations.\n\nAny discussion around 'why/why not' and 'defrag' needs to include Diskeeper (formerly Executive Software).

I'm currently installing samba4 as for a -extra own chosen- schoolproject. I'm following the HOWTO installation from their website. Now, I'm stuck at getting my dns working. \nI've installed bind9 with sudo apt-get install bind9 (version 9.7.x). I've added the samba4 named.conf file to my named.conf.local using include \"/usr/local/samba/private/named.conf\";.\nNow when i try to restart my bind9 service using sudo /etc/init.d/bind9 restart I get the following error: \n\nUnsupported DLZ database driver 'dlopen'.\n\nI've googled the problem and all i could find was that my current version from bind9 didn't had dlz for dlopen. So i've downloaded BIND9 9.8.0P1 from the ics.org website and did sudo ./configure --with-dlz-dlopen and then sudo make and then sudo make install.\nNow I thought this should fix the problem but the problem still exists. Named -v give me version 9.8.0P1. All this is configured on the newest Ubuntu (11.10).\nSo to make the question small: How do I install bind9 with dlz dlopen drivers included.\n\nA: I think this forum post has a tutorial to do what you are attempting.\n\nA: You need bind9 version 9.8.X to make it work and configure it with -> \n./configure --prefix=/usr --sysconfdir=/etc/bind --localstatedir=/var --mandir=/usr/share/man --enable-threads --with-libtool && make && make install\nadd the named.conf from the samba dirs to the bind9 named.conf (include it).\nAnd fix /etc/apparmor.d/usr.sbin.named to access the needed files.\n/usr/local/samba/private/* rw,\n/usr/local/samba/private/dns/* rw,\nI still have to fix some minor probs but at least samba4 does DNS updates. If you already made  a db file with your domain you must remove it or you get an error it is already defined.\nWatch your /var/log/syslog for messages from bind or apparmor.\n", "Q: Why won't tomcat6 not bind to port 80? I'm aware of the implications of running tomcat on port 80, but I'm after a quick solution. I'm trying to follow this tutorial. I've followed the tutorial with two changes:\n\n\n*\n\n*tomcat6 is user name tomcat is run as\n\n*The location of tomcat conf file: /usr/share/tomcat6/bin/catalina.sh\nBut I'm still getting permissions errors.

(make a script so its done automatically on uppstart\nor you can create a Apache reverse proxy that actually proxies the connections to your tomcatserver through it (this is good since it can actually cache request and speed up connections for you)\n\nA: In the Tomcat HTTP connector, make sure your connector on port 80 is binding to ALL interfaces,  or  0.0.0.0  ,  rather than just 127.1  .   That might explain why your not able to connect with a url such as  http://10.0.0.2:80   but  you can with  http://127.1:80\n\nA: Start tomcat services using authbind this will allow user to start ports less than 1024 we do not need to redirect or iptables.  \n\napt-get install authbind -y\n\nTo install Authbind software\n\nchmod -R 755 /etc/authbind\n\ngroup should be user group.\n\nchown -Rh root:group /etc/authbind\n\nAfter that run the below commands\n\ncd /etc/authbind/byuid\n\nAs an example lets imagne user id is 2000 you can use your user id number\n\necho '0.0.0.0/0:1,1023' > 2000\n\nThat file should be own by user and group.\nchown : 2000\nchmod 700 2000\nAdd the below line in tomcat startup file $CATALINA_BASE/startup.sh\nexport JAVA_OPTS=\"$JAVA_OPTS -Djava.net.preferIPv4Stack=true\"\n\nFor Starting tomcat using Authbind service startup.sh\nComment the below line \n#$CATALINA_HOME/bin/startup.sh\n\nAdd This End as the end of the file\nAUTHBIND_COMMAND=\"/usr/bin/authbind --deep /bin/bash -c \" \n\n$AUTHBIND_COMMAND $CATALINA_HOME/bin/startup.sh   \n\nnow you should be able to start tomcat services as user with less that 1024 ports.\n", "Q: how do I know what process requires the keyring to be unlocked At login the keyring always asks me to unlock it.

I want to change the background image in the Nautilus file browser. My idea is to put my own style in the background. I'm using Ubuntu 11.10 and Nautilus is version 3.\nI know that I have to change the nautilus.css file of the theme, but the problem is that there is not a parameter for the background. I just want to apply an image but I can't find the file or parameter to change it.\nThe CSS file is in the directory /home/UserName/.theme/MyTheme/gtk-3.0/apps. I've changed the nautilus.css file. I wrote two new lines using CSS style but I don't know where the correct place is to put it. The lines are:\n\nbackground-image: url(\"carbon.jpg\");\nbackground-repeat: repeat;\n\nObviously I put the image called carbon.jpg in the same directory of nautilus.css, but this change doesn't work because I need to know whichs class displays the Nautilus file browsing frame. If I find this class I guess that this code will work.\nIf someone knows how to do it, please tell me because I really want to make this change.\n\nA: *\n\n*Open the file /usr/share/themes/MyTheme/gtk-3.0/apps/nautilus.css\n(Requires root permission).\n\n*Add this line:\nNautilusWindow * {background-image:url(\"bg.jpg\");} \nwhere bg.jpg is the background image you want to display.\n\n*Run nautilus -q to kill all open file browsers.\n\n*Run nautilus.  \nThis will apply background to all classes present inside NautilusWindow.You can identify the classes where you don't want to apply background and add background-image:none;\nExample:\nNautilusWindow .sidebar,\nNautilusFloatingBar,\nNautilusWindow .sidebar .view {\n    background-image: none;\n}\n\n\nA: The part of the theme you want to alter is .view, so in nautilus.css include the following section:\nNautilusWindow *.view {\n  background-color: @your_predefined_color_here;\n}\n\nFrom my own experimentation on 12.04.1 LTS, I've found that it is possible to define your own background-color property in here with a hexadecimal RGB value, but you cannot set a background-image using -gtk-gradient.\nThus, you probably won't be able to set a background image, but you can at least change the color.\nNote: if you don't want this to affect your sidebar, follow the last part of ignite's answer, but use background-color instead of background-image unless you also set that further down in your theme file.\n\nI got the idea to theme .view partially from this Arch Linux forums thread.\n\nA: If you want just a solid color you open up dconf-editor, go to org > gnome > desktop > interface > gtk color scheme and type base_color:#999999 in the box next to it.\n", "Q: How to abort a stuck command in ubuntu server? I know there is ctrl+c, but sometimes that doesn't work. In Ubuntu desktop I can just close the terminal window and open a new one when this happens, but how would this be solved using the CLI in Ubuntu server (without restarting the box)?\n\nA: If you have full console access, you can do Alt-F1..12 and get a new console. \nFrom there, you can do a process listing like follows:\nps aux | grep <process-name>\n\nThen do a kill on the process ID:\nkill -9 <pid>\n\nIf you don't have full console access, just open another terminal window (perhaps via PuTTY or similar), and do the above process listing and kill steps.\n\nA: CTRL+C will send SIGINT to the application. The application can configure a handler for this signal or it can ignore the signal. By default there is no handler and SIGINT will kill the application.\nYou can use CTRL+\\ which will send SIGQUIT. This will also generate a core dump if the core limit is not zero.\nYou can suspend the process and return to shell with CTRL+Z, this will stop the execution of the process and return to the shell prompt. The process will be in memory and it will be available as a job in the current shell. You can then use kill -SIGNAL %% or kill -SIGNAL %<job_ID> to send a signal to that job. E.g. to kill the last job use kill -9 %%\nIf none of them are working you can always send SIGTERM, then, as last resort, SIGKILL which will terminate any process. This signal as any other signals must be sent as the same user as the process you are trying to stop or as root. To send SIGKILL to process, first find the process with ps aux or ps -edf, then run kill -SIGKILL <process_ID>, where the <process_ID> is the PID column in ps output.\nThe signals can not be delivered if the process is in an uninterruptible call. Uninterruptible calls are kernel functions that can not be stopped and usually happen because of a bad driver (e.g. a driver that is not reentrant). A process that is in uninterruptible sleep can not be stopped until the call gets completed or the server is rebooted. Those signals will be held in the pending (Pnd) signals list. The pending signals for a process can be show with this small script that is just geting them from /proc/<PID>/status.\nIf a process becomes a zombie, it will not use any resources only taking space in the process table. A zombie process can not receive signals.\nThe list of signals for the current architecture can be found with kill -l\nSee the man pages of kill, ps and bash. To see a man page use something like: man ps\n\nA: Ctrl C sends a SIGINT to your running process. \nIf you don't want to open another console you can send a SIGQUIT with Ctrl \\. This will address most day to day hung apps that the SIGINT does not. \nI've personally wanted a way to send a SIGKILL with a shortcut but I'm not aware of a way to do so. \n\nA: I consider pgrep and pkill to be easier to use than kill with an explicit process ID.\nAlso, instead of starting with signal 9 (SIGKILL), consider starting with the default SIGTERM (15).   This will give the process a chance to terminate gracefully (if it can). \npkill -15 thing and pkill thing should be equivalent. \nHere's how that would work.  Let's say that ntpd is hung. \nWhat are the processes?  (You can skip to pkill if you believe you won't have false positives). \n$ pgrep -fl ntp\n1034 /usr/sbin/ntpd\n1037 /usr/sbin/ntpd\n\nKill the processes:\n$ pkill ntpd\n\nUse pgrep again to see if it was successful. \nIf not, eventually move to pkill -9. \n\nA: Answer\nCntrl + \\ worked for me (where Cntrl + c or z didn't work) \nOptional reading\nI usually follow the steps below when Ubuntu 16.04 freezes in my Lenovo Thinkpad E470.\n\n\n*\n\n*Go to no-gui mode (Cntrl + Alt + F1).\n\n*Use top command to see which process has high CPU usage (above 50% or so). Note the PID of the process.\n\n*Come out of top command (press q).\n\n*[Only if you know kill command] Kill the process using kill -9 <process ID you noted down>.\n\n*Go back to UI mode (Cntrl + Alt + F7)\n\n\nA: You would switch to a new terminal, find the PID of the stuck process (using ps), then use kill to kill the process. I would first use kill (PID). If that doesn't work, I would use kill -9 (PID). If that doesn't stop the process the machine needs to be rebooted.\n", "Q: Weird graphical errors in console and on computer shut down I am all new to Ubuntu (and Linux in general) and I am experiencing some strange graphic on my screen.\nConsole #1 (ctrl+alt+f1):\n\nExactly the same happens on all the other consoles (2-6), and the consoles don't seem to work.

Does it require UltraBase? Any special tweaks or modifications?\n\nA: It works but it is unstable. For example, if you hibernate with the dual displays active and resume with just the laptop's screen, it may be that you will get no display (actually, the display will be full of useless vertical black and white lines). The only way to get out of this is to power cycle or remote ssh and reboot.\nOn other occasions, if the external screen was the main screen, you may end up having the laptop screen being ok but the Unity focus still be on the external screen (which you unplugged), thereby preventing you from doing anything useful with the desktop. You cannot even reboot since you cannot clock on anything.

I have just installed Ubuntu 11.10 on the Btrfs filesystem.\nDo I really need to defragment files or the whole system?\nDefragment # btrfs filesystem defragment /pool1    Defragment\nBtrfs defragmentation\n\nA: You don't really need to defrag Btrfs filesystems manually.\nYes, Btrfs is COW (copy-on-write), which would imply it fragments files much more than Ext, but this is addressed in several aspects of the design, including the ability to easily defrag the filesystem while it is online. This excerpt provides more detail (emphasis mine):\n\nAutomatic defragmentation\nCOW (copy-on-write) filesystems have many advantages, but they also have some disadvantages, for example fragmentation. Btrfs lays out the data sequentially when files are written to the disk for first time, but a COW design implies that any subsequent modification to the file must not be written on top of the old data, but be placed in a free block, which will cause fragmentation (RPM databases are a common case of this problem). Additionally, it suffers the fragmentation problems common to all filesystems.\nBtrfs already offers alternatives to fight this problem: First, it supports online defragmentation using the command btrfs filesystem defragment. Second, it has a mount option, -o nodatacow, that disables COW for data. Now btrfs adds a third option, the -o autodefrag mount option. This mechanism detects small random writes into files and queues them up for an automatic defrag process, so the filesystem will defragment itself while it's used. It isn't suited to virtualization or big database workloads yet, but works well for smaller files such as rpm, SQLite or bdb databases.\n\nSo, as long as you don't plan to run IO-intensive software like a database under significant load, you should be all good, as long as you mount your filesystems with the autodefrag option.\nTo check the fragmentation of files, you can use the filefrag utility:\n$ find /path -type f -exec filefrag {} + >frag.list\n# Now you can use your favourite tools to sort the data\n\nOn Systemd systems, /var/log/journal/ will probably be the most fragmented. You can also look at ~/.mozilla and other browsers databases.\nTo defragment, use:\n$ sudo btrfs fi defrag -r /path\n\n\nA: The command to defrag a btrfs filesystem is\nbtrfs filesystem defragment sync -r -v -f [-czlib] / /home\n\n\nA: Based on this answer I came up with:\nsudo find / -xdev -type f -exec filefrag {} + | sed -En 's/(.+): (\\w+) extent.*/\\2 \\1/p' | sort -nr\n\nThis lists the most fragmented files first, with the format:\n<num-fragments> <pathname>\n\n\nA: From the manpage as seen by running man btrfs-filesystem, for the usage of btrfs filesystem defragment (or, short, btrfs fi de):\ndefragment [options] <file>|<dir> [<file>|<dir>...]\n       Defragment file data on a mounted filesystem. Requires kernel\n       2.6.33 and newer.\n\nThough the interesting part is the warning:\n        Warning\n        Defragmenting with Linux kernel versions < 3.9 or ≥ 3.14-rc2 as well as with\n        Linux stable kernel versions ≥ 3.10.31, ≥ 3.12.12 or ≥ 3.13.4 will break up\n        the reflinks of COW data (for example files copied with cp --reflink,\n        snapshots or de-duplicated data). This may cause considerable increase of\n        space usage depending on the broken up reflinks.\n\nI don't know why they did it, but depending on which Linux kernel version you are using defragmentation might (on affected kernels it will) break all deduplication that may be present in the filesystem. For me, personally, I find deduplication and CoW to be very important features of btrfs. Loosing it due to defragemtation is a thought that scares me, because there is no easy way—that I know of—to easily recreate CoW extents (i.e. deduplication).\nFor example, I ran duperemove on an almost full 8 TB SATA HDD and it took days. Defragmenting would not only have me do it all over, it would also probably fill up the whole drive in the process by breaking CoW data...\nLong story short: regularly running btrfs scrub (checking the filesystem) or even btrfs balance (rebalance data across devices, more important for RAID configurations) on the filesystem is probably more important than defragmentation...\nSee also a related question at Unix&Linux: btrfs — Is it dangerous to defragment subvolume which has readonly snapshots?\n\nA: For the the sake of this topic i think is better to clarify that:\n\nAny filesystem != recovery/management utilities\n\nKeep in mind that the filesystem is about how data is organized on a physical hardware, every other activity is done with extra software and utilities that, especially in the GNU/linux, are done by peoples that probably are not strictly related with who had made the filesystem.\nThis is probably not the case of the Btrfs, but sometimes we are near to that because desktop and enterprise environments can provide different solutions with different grades of realiability.\nThe answer to your question is \"no\" but is a \"no\" related to the normal behaviour of a generic filesystem, and every utility you can find about this is simply a different project.\nWhen you need to defrag your filesystem keep in mind that you are going to use external software that is not really related to the life of the filesystem itself, with all the pros and cons.\n", "Q: How do I install a driver for a Brother MFC-J270W printer?

Is there a way to make it stay permanently loaded in the RAM or something so that it shows up faster?\n\nA: \nYes, this is Ubuntu 11.10. I have an old computer, so maybe that's the problem. My processor is Intel® Pentium(R) 4 CPU 1.50GHz and my graphics card is GeForce2 MX/AGP/SSE2\n\nI think you are correct -- the problem is your CPU is old and very slow and your GPU (graphics card) is also old and doesn't support compositing and other features. This means everything must be rendered in software, and that is a burden for your CPU.\nThe Pentium 4 CPUs were notorious for providing extremely poor performance compared to what their clock speed was (1.5 GHz, here); for example, the CPUMark below shows that a Celeron M at half-the-speed or 800 MHz (released 3 years later) is faster than a Pentium 4 1.5 GHz:\n\nUnfortunately, the solution to continue using the latest Ubuntu on your current hardware probably involves switching from Unity 2D to a lighter desktop environment such as XFCE or LXDE; perhaps you could try an Xubuntu/Lubuntu LiveCD to get a feel for what kind of performance to expect.\n\nA: I really don't know if it will make your Dash open faster as this program makes programs lauch faster and the Dash isn't exactly a program, but you can test it:\nsudo apt-get install preload\nPreload is a little program that fills your RAM memory with the most used programs/files, so it won't work at the moment of the installation, but within two days using the pc it will take effect as it will memorize the common programs that you use.\n\nA: Try \nsudo dpkg-reconfigure unity-2d\n\nand see if that speeds it up.\n\nA: Okay it sounds like your RAM is definitely going but to make sure run a boot-able program called MEMTEST86 and let it run for a while and see if any errors pop up. If you get no errors that doesn't automatically exclude the troubleshooting the RAM.\nBut before you go out and buy a new stick check your HDD. There is also another program (boot-able also) called Spin Rite and it checks for problems on your HDD (If this one shows no errors you are good to go, if it does you are in trouble.)\nIf the Spin Rite passes your next step is to continue troubleshooting your RAM..... Replace it with a new one and see if the condition still exists. If so well stick the other 1GB stick in and now you have 2GB. But to fix the issue we have to narrow it down.\nIf you have a Graphics Card installed on your system remove it and check to see if condition is still persistent. If so then you know now that it isn't the graphics card and it leaves three final problems.\nGo ahead and stick your graphics card back in (if you have one) and look around at the capacitors and resistors on your motherboard and make sure none of them are blown (they will have bulging tops much like a cola that has gotten too hot and expanded.)\nIf none are then you are left with two options. It is software or it is the processor. Deciding between these two is easy. If you made a backup then time to clean install Ubuntu. Then try it. If problem still persists then you know what your problem is: the processor.\nI made this tutorial in chronoaffordableologic order meaning it is cheapest and least expensive to start with what I stated first and work your way down.\n\nA: I don't know if this is of any help to you, but ubuntu-tweak is a great application that seems to load my dash at twice the speed after installing it and tweaking some items. I suggest you run Computer Janitor - enhanced speed performance without OverClocking your processor. ubuntu-tweak with Computer Janitor built in is available in the Software Center. \n", "Q: Is it possible to have the same effect of the ALT F2 like Gnome Shell I was trying Gnome Shell (in openSuse) and found out that when I do the old ALT + F2 and the old execute command is now a small black space to complete...

If you would like to have a look in something else, there are:\ngmrun\ngrun\nbashrun\nIf you want something more than just a run dialog, have a look at\ngnome-do\nsynapse\nkupfer\n\nA: Lubuntu uses LXDE, which is a different desktop environment than Gnome. However, anything that can be installed in Ubuntu can be installed in Lubuntu, and Ubuntu now uses Gnome 3 by default. \nIn other words; it is not possible to get the same Alt+F2 dialog in LXDE as you have in Gnome Shell, but it is possible to install Gnome Shell and use it in Lubuntu, as long as you are using Lubuntu 11.10. \nFirst, install Gnome Shell. It is likely to require a little time to download since it has requirements not shared with LXDE.

I installed the software from the Software Center and was wondering how to be sure it is up to date with the latest Python and where to go online for a guide that you would suggest, such as Non-Programmer's Tutorial for Python 3.\n\nA: You'll find a lot of information for non-programmers here.\n\nA: *\n\n*Learn Python the Hard Way is a book by the wonderful Zed Shaw - he has been known to say (and others have said this as well) that once you've read/done the book, \"you are a Developer, not a programmer\", which can be nice. ;)\n\n*Python Beginners guide. - the official Python.org guide.\n\nA: Welcome to the world of development on Ubuntu, John. Python is a wonderful programming language and is one of the absolute most popular ones in Ubuntu, which means there are many people who can help you get started and lots of good resources. \nFor direct help, I would recommend Ubuntu App Developer which is a website on http://developer.ubuntu.com, an active IRC channel on Freenode, called #ubuntu-app-devel and a mailinglist that you can join here: https://lists.ubuntu.com/mailman/listinfo/ubuntu-app-devel\nPython.org in general is a very good resource, and you have many good references to free books, etc in the answer jcollado provided. \nHowever, I would probably start with Python 2.7 is I were you. Though Python 3.x is available and is maturing nicely, a lot of third party libraries (programming tools) are still not upgraded and is therefore not available in Python 3.x yet. It is very easy to learn Python 3 when you've learned Python 2 first in any case, so your effort will not be wasted. Tools like Quickly and Quickly Widgets are not available for Python 3.x yet. They make it much easier and faster to get started developing real applications and publishing them as packages to be installed. You can read more about them on http://developer.ubuntu.com. \nHave a lot of fun! :)\n\nA: This free online book is pretty good, I was working through it myself.\n\nA: Python is one of languages out there with Tons of resources. Here I will highlight few to start with. The best for beginners is the Official tutorial. Start there and once you are done you can have your books for in depth explanations. Some people starts with books and ends with tutorial but order is not that important. Some books are:\nThinking Python\nA Byte of Python\nDive Into Python\nLearn Python The Hard Way\nAlso if you have bandwidth check Bucky's youtube channel\n\nA: I have always found the O'Reilly series a good place to look when starting to learn any programming language (whether it's your first, or your fiftith...).\nTherefore I can whole heartedly recommend the 'Learning Python' book which I have used (and still use) to write my first opensource programme. It'll take you through non-language specific things like variables and modules, as well as introduce you to using python.\nPersonally, following from what Jo-Erlend Schinstad said, I would say start with Python 3. I my experience I've only found one library (GTK) which I needed that wasn't ported, and there are plenty of examples around now if you get stuck for code.\n\nA: Many of the obvious locations of resources such as python.org have already been mentioned, but I would like to comment on a couple of others, and bring to light one that hasn't been mentioned before.\nI have found that the freely available Think Python is an excellent introductory guide to both Python and programming in general. It has been updated for Python 3 here, and has been added to as recently as June 2012. The book has a lot of general points about programming as well which allow you to understand all the major concepts involved and the workflows that programmers construct. It contains chapters on the major aspects of Python and exercises to complete so that it helps you apply what you have learned.\nI would also like to mention a site called codeacademy, which has recently began to offer some free interactive courses in Python as well as their other free courses on different programming languages.  At the moment the tutorials are based on Python 2.7.3, although they will probably have some courses on Python 3 soon. They are still useful, however, for gaining some kind of introduction to Python. \nA screenshot from the Python page is below and shows the initial exercises offered on the site and a lot more have been added recently; there are over 12 sections with hundreds of exercises ranging from functions to loops to input/output operations.\n\n", "Q: One click access to bookmarked files?

I copied the .desktop file of the application to my home directory and edited the line beginning with Exec= to include the file I want to launch. For example, Exec=appname /home/filename and then I dragged the edited .desktop file to the Unity Launcher.\n\nA: I have found another excellent solution: Cairo Dock\nI am very impressed with this wonderful launcher.

How can I easily add this share to the /etc/fstab file?\nBy easy I mean right clicking on the share I want to link in and choosing something like \"Map Network Drive\"! I don't know the details of the machine that holds this share and that is why I have been using Nautilus to browse the network for it. Right clicking on the share in Nautilus and viewing properties does not seem to give me enough information for an fstab entry.\nPlease can you tell me how to achieve this?\n\nA: It sounds like what you actually want is the ability to quickly access a particular network mount? If so, simply right-click on the network mount and select \"Add Bookmark\", you'll then be able to access that mount from the bookmark link on subsequent boots.\nThat is a much safer option that modifying your systems /etc/fstab file: if /etc/fstab gets corrupted, you may end up with a system that won't boot. And even if you do update /etc/fstab correctly for the mount in question, you will potentially impact boot performance by specifying a network (non-local) mount there.\nIf you really, really want to update /etc/fstab, there is a command-line tool that will show mount details for nautilus mounts:\ngvfs-mount -l\n\nOr for more details:\ngvfs-mount -li\n\n\nA: You can browse all Nautilus mounts via the command line. No need to create an fstab entry. Run mount to view all filesystem mount locations (including Nautilus ones).\nIn the case of network Samba mounts I found that Nautilus puts them all under a common gvfs mount point. Run mount | grep gvfs. For me the location was /run/user/leif/gvfs/ and inside were my Samba mounts.\n\nA: its not \"super easy\" i would say \nbut here is the syntax for FSTAB. If you install the autofs it can be configured to mount automatically  you \"enter\" the folder\nyou're not saying what network file sharing protocol you are accessing so I'm assuming its windows:\nfrom the terminal it would be something like this:\nmount -t cifs -o username=yourusername,password=yourpassword,domain=yourdomain //server/sharename/ /mnt/folderonyourcomp/\nin fstab it would look fairly much the same\nthe\nunder options: username=yourusername,password=yourpassword,domain=yourdomain\nunder type: cifs\nunder file system :  /mnt/folderonyourcomputer   (this is your local mountpoint for the remote share)\n", "Q: How to change directory using script I have this script\n#!/bin/bash\ncd /home/user/somedir\npwd\n\nit works as expected, but I would like this script to transport me to /home/user/somedir, but I stay in the same dir.\nHow to write script that will transport me (in gnome-terminal) to /home/user/somedir?\n\nA: Use exec bash at the end\n\nA bash script operates on its current environment or on that of its\n  children, but never on its parent environment.\n\nHowever, this question often gets asked because one wants to be left at a bash prompt in a certain directory after the execution of a bash script from another directory.\nIf this is the case, simply execute a child bash instance at the end of the script:\n#!/bin/bash\ncd /home/user/somedir\nexec bash\n\n\nA: You need to source your script.

Anyway, when the input-device-added event is emitted myservice.conf gets called correctly and the first few lines of script get parsed. But when the daemon gets launched it never completely starts running and Upstart seemingly kills it prematurely.\nI've tried using Upstart in two different ways, both give me the same problem:\nauthor \"AnVoWiDo\"\nstart on input-device-added\nscript\ndevice='printinputdevices | grep thecorrectdevice'\necho $device \n/start/my/daemon -option device\nend script\n\nand also\nauthor \"AnVoWiDo\"\nstart on input-device-added\nexec myscript.sh\n\nwhere myscript.sh file contains the script above. The echo command in there is just for diagnostics and outputs correctly in both methods.\nRunning myscript.sh from terminal will start the daemon perfectly fine with all the expected output. The same is true for running the \"/start/my/daemon -option device\" command, both will output something along the lines of\ndevice 0: /dev/input/event9 mydevice\nDisplay name: :0\n\nBut when launching it from Upstart (with service myservice start or by plugging in a new input device) the output halts midway 'Display name: :0' and only logs 'Display name: ' at which point Upstart kills the process. It looks to me like the double colon in the output is the culprit (or of course the :0), and perhaps Upstart mistakes it for an error code of sorts?\nAnyone know of a different method of starting my service at the correct moment?\nPerhaps I have missed something stupid and obvious while making the Upstart conf file which can be fixed?\nLastly maybe Upstart can in some way be convinced to ignore the \": :0\" in output (if this really is the cause of course) and keep running the daemon?\n\nA: Display Name :0 is referring to an X display. It works in your GUI terminal because $DISPLAY is set to :0.\nIf you want the service to start on your GUI, then you should do\nenv DISPLAY=\":0\"\nexec /start/my/daemon\n\n\nA: Upstart runs the script as root, which probably doesn't have the DISPLAY environment set (demonstrated by your script debug: Display name: <empty>.

While installing Ubuntu 11.10 a months ago I had not allotted any swap space, I now came to know that there would be no Hibernate option without Swap space.\nIs it possible to do it Now?, What if the drives mess up? I have 4 gigabytes of ram, a 500 GB disk and I'm dual-booting with Windows 7.\n\nA: Make a backup of all your important data before attempting this.\nYou need to boot from your installation media and use the Gparted application to shrink the filesystem, it is generally recommended to have a swap partition double the size of your RAM. Once you have shrunk the filesystem you should right-click on the now \"unallocated space\" and format it as swap. Once done, hit the \"Apply all operations\" button and reboot.\nNow you should be back in your main Ubuntu system. \nYou need to run the gksudo gedit /etc/fstab command and add a line like this:\n/dev/sdXY swap swap defaults 0 0 \nOf course, change the XY to the correct settings for the system. \nFinally, reboot or run sudo swapon /dev/sdXY to use the swap without rebooting.\n\nA: You can use gparted to resize your partitions and make some space to a new swap partition. Although this works pretty good according to my own experience, before doing it, you should make a backup of all your files just in case.\n", "Q: Ubuntu needs Swap, Why not Windows? Ive learned that one should allot a swap space inorder to have Hibernate option in Ubuntu, Why isnt it same with Windows? My Win 7 doesnt have any Swap space but still hibernates without a glitch. \n\nA: Windows uses a file for that instead of a partition. According to wikipedia\n\nA file, \"hiberfil.sys\" is used to store the contents of RAM when the computer hibernates, and is always the same size as the total RAM. A hidden system file resides in the root of the system partition, usually \"C:\\hiberfil.sys\".\n\nRegarding why linux uses a partition by default. Honestly, I don't know, but I guess it's because of performance reasons.\nEdit: As pointed out in a comment, you can also swap to a file as explained in the answers to this question.\n\nA: Typically a swap file is used when the RAM is exceeded to free the RAM by storing its content to a swap file. \nIn Windows environments this is a file (usually pagefile.sys) which is stored on the system partition.\nIn Linux it is recommended to create an extra partition for swap. As far as I know this is not needed, you should be able to hibernate without an extra partition because linux should be able to use a file, too. For further information: https://superuser.com/questions/21020/can-i-hibernate-linux-without-a-swap-partition\nThe advantages of an extra swap partition are:\n\n\n*\n\n*Security: Linux wipes the swap file securely before shutdown so nobody can restore it.\n\n*Performance: You may wish to map your swap partition to an SSD to increase speed.\n\n*Even if your system partition is full, you have some space for your swap data.\n\n\nA: Linux uses the swap partition for both paging and hibernation.  Windows uses a separate file for each.  It uses pagefile.sys for paging, and hiberfil.sys for hibernation, so while you might not have a pagefile, you still have a hibernation file.\n", "Q: Password Reset Disk I use Windows 7 as my secondary OS and it has an option for creating Password reset disk i.e. a flash drive when inserted to a locked Win 7 (in case password is forgotten), would reset the system password and open the system for the user. Is it possible to make something like that for ubuntu 11.10????\n\nA: Actually, there's no need for a separate disk, you just boot into recovery mode and do it from there.\n\n\n*\n\n*If you don't see grub at boot time then hold down the shift key as the machine starts, and the text-based menu should pop up before the ubuntu logo. If you do see grub (if you have a dual-boot setup you normally will) then ignore this step.\n\n*Select the top-most 'Recovery mode' option. The machine will boot to a coloured text-mode 'Recovery Menu'.\n\n*Select 'remount'. Hit enter when it's done.\n\n*Select 'root'.\n\n*Set the password with passwd <username>.\n\n*reboot\nSeems insecure right? This is why you should encrypt your user account if you care that much.\n\nA: This can usually be done from the live cd. All you have to do is boot from the live cd and run these commands, adjusting for your system:\nsudo mkdir /mnt/ubuntu\nsudo mount /dev/sdXY /mnt/ubuntu\nsudo chroot /mnt/ubuntu\npasswd <insert-username>\nexit\nsudo umount /mnt/ubuntu\n\nNow reboot into your installed system and your password will be changed to what you entered in the passwd command's prompts.\n", "Q: How can I install Manycam or a Manycam equivalent in Ubuntu 10.04?

Has this issue been dealt with in the latest Kernel 3.2?\n\nA: Am guessing you are talking about laptops, video cards and specially Intel ones. There is an improvement mentioned in sites like Phoronix and OMGUbuntu but for what I have tested, is not yet activated. It should be by the end of 12.04 since the patches and changes are going to be applied to the 3.2 kernel anyway, which is the default for 12.04 now.\nWhy I suggest is to wait for the final release since this is an Alpha and an Alpha 1 for that matter and since our problem is very bad (power sucked out quickly and temperatures really bad) it is better to test it with something stable than something not quite finished yet.\n\nA: No, it isn't/won't be fixed in 3.2.

This means there is only 1 primary partition available for the os.\nHow to get the 2 dynamic disk into a primary one.\nHow to release 1 of the 2 hidden partitions without losing the recover data?\n\nA: I did not understand your question very well but here is a possible answer. \nSince you have four primary partitions you can't create another because a disk (with an msdos-style partition table, as is common) can have at most four primary partitions:\n\nThe total data storage space of a PC hard disk can be divided into at\n  most four primary partitions, or alternatively three primary\n  partitions and an extended partition. These partitions are described\n  by 16-byte entries that constitute the Partition Table, located in the\n  master boot record.\n\nSo, you must delete one partition and crate an extended one. Then you can create as many partitions as you want within this extended one. Doing this is up to you. Maybe you can move your data to another available partition or USB disk. After this you can shape your disk for your needs.\n\nA: On my new laptop are 2 hidden primary part. inaccesible- unchangeable as OEM and win7 startup (100mb) in use.\n2 part as dynamic. incl 1 part as win7 OS part.

I recommend nano (which is the default sudoedit editor in later distributions of Ubuntu) instead of sudoedit because the default can be overridden in non-obvious ways (unless you are an administrator).  sudoedit is safer in that it automatically saves a backup copy of the edited file, but the \"-B\" command line option in nano does the same thing.  nano is safer than other editors like vi or emacs because it doesn't have scary shell escapes.\nIf you prefer not to use the nano editor and prefer the Gnome Text Editor, instead of sudo nano -B use gksu gedit.  I generally do this for large files, and /etc/default/grub could easily be considered a large file.  Thus type in gksu gedit /etc/default/grub instead of sudo nano -B /etc/default/grub.  Note that the Gnome text editor does not automatically make a backup! \n", "Q: Ubuntu 11.10 doesn't recognise second graphics card I have two graphics cards installed, both nVidia. a GeForce 9600 and a GeForce 6200 TurboCache.

I have an Optimus laptop. I have Ironhide installed, and can use optirun to run programs using the discrete GPU from the command line. However, is there any way to run Compiz itself on the discrete GPU?\n\nA: At present with the current version of Bumblebee (3.0) this is not possible. Running optirun compiz --replace results in a segmentation fault. This would be a topic to bring up on the Bumblebee forums. However, running compiz using the accelerated graphics completely ruins the whole point of Bumblebee, which is to only run applications which require more graphics capabilities on the better GPU, therefore saving battery life. Running compiz, a process which runs all the time, on the higher power consumption GPU would cause a significant loss of battery life.

Adding user to audio and video groups solved the problem.\n\nA: OP has resolved the problem and posted answer as an update to the question;\n\nSOLVED: apparently it had to do with lack of audio. While chrome would\n  play the video with no sound, libwebkit wouldn't start video. Adding\n  user to audio and video groups solved the problem.\n\n\nA: I suppose that Chrome has a better integration with X, if you had dealt with some missing codecs your browser should not even show the first frame.\nIf you check the library used by Chrome with\nldd /opt/google/chrome/chrome \n\nyou can easily find out that Chrome uses a good amount of library related to X where Firefox simply don't do the same.\nldd /opt/google/chrome/chrome | grep X\n\nYou can check the libraries used by firefox with\nldd /usr/lib/firefox-*/firefox\n\nI think that this can be a problem related with the X buffer used by the codec that play your video.\n", "Q: Paper documents (archive) manager for Ubuntu I'm looking for an archive manager for Ubuntu. By 'archive' I mean a real archive, the one with paper documents inside. I tried Tellico, but it's really intended for books, not documents.\nAny suggestions?\n\nA: I believe a reference manager like jabRef would help you,\n jabref  is available from the repositories.\njabRef uses the Bibtex standard to store information about a wide variety of document types the Bibtex file is an ascii file that looks like this:\n@article{Gettys90,\n   author = {Jim Gettys and Phil Karlton and Scott McGregor},\n   title = {The {X} Window System, Version 11},\n   journal = {Software Practice and Experience},\n   volume = {20},\n   number = {S2},\n   year = {1990},\n   abstract = {A technical overview of the X11 functionality.  This is an update\nof the X10 TOG paper by Scheifler \\& Gettys.}\n}\n\nYour documents does not have to be books and they can be hard copies on a shelf or in a filing cabinet, or electronic on your computer, in the case of physical documents you just number the articles and use that as the number in the BibTex file, if they are electronic you can have a link to them in the BibTex file, they could even be on the internet.\nYou can read more about BibTeX here:\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BibTeX\nTake a look at the various Entry types. When you use this method to manage papers you have great flexibility as jabRef can export to many other Reference formats or export your library to a web page and so on. jabRef also has a good search facility. you can create citations for Latex and Office documents that refers to your papers.\njabRef tutorials are here:\nhttp://www.cs.rpi.edu/~tayloj/JABREF.TUTORIAL/\nThere is a warning about this being old but from what I see it is still applicable.\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRteWsNfMeg\nThis YouTube video is also helpful.\n\nA: I am going to guess that you are looking for a Document Management system and here are some programs that I have found in the Ubuntu software Centre.\nLetoDMS - this is the document management program. These are some other programs that you might find useful to complete your task\nOffice Document Reader - a launcher to convert MS Office files to PDF.\nPDFMod - Remove, extract and rotate pages in PDF documents\nOCRFeeder - The complete OCR suite.\nPDF-Shuffler - PDF Merging, Rearranging, Splitting, Rotating and Cropping.\nI give these in case you are looking for the complete solution. They are all Ubuntu programs as requested.\nEdit: Oops! Right answer to the wrong question.\n\nA: Alfresco could be what you are looking for. http://www.alfresco.com/\nBut it might be too much for what you are looking for. \n", "Q: Computer froze when installing Ubuntu I was installing Ubuntu on my Windows 7 laptop (creating a dual boot) and the wifi doesn't work on the laptop so I had to plug it in on the slower connection, and when it was trying to download the language packs it froze and has now been frozen for almost half an hour! What should I do? Any help appreciated thanks.\n\nA: Windows turns of the wifi card  when it's shut down. When you start Ubuntu you have to toggle the wifi card (there should be a button or switch) and then reboot.  Also, make sure that \"enable wireless\" has a check next to it in the drop down menu from the icon in the top left. That should take care of the wifi issue.\nWhich version of Ubuntu are you trying to install? I noticed on 11.10 that everything went way smoother if I didn't select for additional drivers and updates to be installed during the OS's installation. So, try a plain install and add everything else after the update once you first boot.\n\nA: If you were installing to a new partition: start again. (i.e. try ctrl-alt-del, or, worst case, turn it off on the switch and turn it back on again.) There's no damage in it, and it's the simplest way to make sure that you end up with a full and complete install.\nIf it crashes again, however, the problem might be a bit more serious and we'll try and sort it out.\n", "Q: Getting drivers to work for intel gma 950 I recently switched over my netbook to Ubuntu 11.10 and I'm having issues with detecting the graphics chipset.\nThe closest I've come to finding a solution that does not require messing with git (something I'm not ready to do) is this. However this seems to be for the 915(M?) chipset and I haven't been able to figure out the grub line-change (i.e. \"i915.modeset=1\") that works for my chipset. Does anyone know which line I should use/or another way to get ubuntu to recognize my chipset?\n\nA: \"i915\" is the actual driver for most, if not all, currently supported intel GPUs. Just add i915.modeset=1 as is, and see what happens. You also have to run sudo update-grub after making the changes - something the author forgot to mention.\n", "Q: Are there plans for a web Interface for Ubuntu Software Centre Most Operating Systems that have a \"App Store\" native application also have a Web version of their app store where applications can be added to a wish list, purchased and/or downloaded. I think it would be a good idea for Ubuntu Software Centre to also have a Web version. \nSince its not a good idea to download .debs, it could be done in such a way that downloads cannot be done if you are not running Ubuntu. This should not be too difficult to implement using the \"apt:\" link parameter. \nSites such as http://getdeb.net already utilize the apt: link in a web store like service. Is this already in the works or are there plans to do it in the future? If no, why not?\n\nA: You can find such an interface at http://apps.ubuntu.com.\nIt's at an early stage right now, so if you can suggest ways\nof improving it, or want to help out with the changes then\nyou can join the mailing list to discuss it.\n\nA: I don't see anything special that will add value to current interface.

Not even when it was progressing through files. Is any of this normal?\nEdit: retried. Must have been a network issue. \n\nA: Stated by OP \nRetried.

If it does not and the computer appears to have locked up, try installing without an internet conection. Is this a wubi or dual boot or a full install (formatting hard drive and devoting all of it to Ubuntu)?\n", "Q: Disable updating of ethernet driver I discovered that the latest driver for my computers ethernet-adapter did not work. I fixed this by downloading an earlier driver, which worked perfectly.\nHowever every time I run \"apt-get upgrade\", the driver I have downgraded gets updated. While simply reinstalling the old driver fixes the issue, it's quite annoying.\nI'm running Ubuntu 11.10 64-bit. The driver that works is \"r8168\" and the newer driver that doesn't work is \"r8169\".\nIs there a way to tell apt not to install the newer, not working, driver?\n\nA: I have this exact same issue with drivers: it's a well known Linux kernel problem with Realtek ethernet adapters, see here and here. I'm guessing you installed the r8168 driver from Realtek by hand on top of the r8169 driver that comes with the Linux kernel. Note that these numbers are not version numbers, but product names. Some people say the r8168 driver from Realtek works better than the r8169 driver from the Linux kernel.\nIf I'm right, then you're installing a kernel module on top of the drivers installed by the linux-image-* package from apt. When you upgrade that script it rebuilds your kernel modules and doesn't know to re-install your custom driver. The problem isn't the driver so much as the whole kernel.\nYou could try pinning linux-image so that apt doesn't ever upgrade it, but then you lose kernel upgrades. Alternately you can reinstall the Realtek driver by hand after every kernel upgrade by re-running autorun.sh from the r8168 code. A third option, one of the links above has a solution that recommends blacklisting the r8169 module that comes with the kernel. However that may leave you with a kernel with no driver for your ethernet, I don't know enough about modules and ramdisks to advise you safely.\n\nA: You can hold the package. Related howto: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/PinningHowto\nJust an easy terminal way:\nsudo -i \necho package_name hold | dpkg --set-selections\n\nReplace package_name with your exact driver package name.\n", "Q: \"can't open display\" weirdness over ssh Some time back, (maybe a year?), my environment was working correctly.  But some time in the last year or so I started getting \"can't open display\" errors.\nIt's weird because I can ssh into the ubuntu box, (from a mac, over cisco ipsec), and start several new x11 clients.  But at some point, (1 - 20 minutes later), new attempts to start x11 clients result in \"can't open display\" errors.  If there's any other antecedent event that leads to the \"can't open display\" problem, I havent' figured it out.\nMy DISPLAY hasn't changed in this time.  Preexisting windows continue to exist and function so I believe my local X11 server is good, running, and that the previously existing X11 forwarding tunnels are still functioning.  It appears to be a problem with the initial rendezvous to the display.\nDoes this sound familiar to anyone?\n\nA: You're seeing the effects of the ForwardX11Trusted option being turned off in ~/.ssh/config. When this option is set to no, remote X clients have fewer permissions on the local X server; this removes some ways in which the administrator of the remote machine can harm yours, but not all of them, so it is not an effective security measure. In addition, this option prevents new X clients from connecting if more than 20 minutes have elapsed since the connection was established.\nUbuntu has this option default to off, but the upstream default has it on. The client machine you're using must have been upgraded or had its configuration changed. Turn on ForwardX11Trusted in your ~/.ssh/config by adding the lines\nHost *\nForwardX11Trusted yes\n\nRecent versions of ssh allow the delay to be configured through the ForwardX11Timeout option, so you can leave ForwardX11Trusted off (for whatever benefit it might provide) and set a very high timeout.\n\nA: I have the same issue,\non the remote server\n1) Adding the following to your sshd_config\nAddressFamily inet\n2) Restart SSH\nref: http://www.linuxquestions.org/questions/ubuntu-63/cant-open-display-882197/\n", "Q: After uninstalling Edubuntu, my dash icon has been replaced by a question mark I'm new to Linux.

No matter what hardware I'm installing Oneiric on, right from pentium to core2duo but mostly laptops, the time it takes to shutdown has raised remarkable (maybe from 10 sec to 60 sec) from Natty to Oneiric (including Precise Alpha1).

My PC logs straight in to Ubuntu Unity without asking for a password.  How do I make my PC boot in to Lubuntu as default instead of Unity.\n\nA: A regular Ubuntu 11.10 system uses LightDM as its display manager, by default. A Lubuntu 11.10 system uses LXDM as its default display manager. When you install lubuntu-desktop on a regular Ubuntu 11.10 system, you may be prompted to select what display manager you wish to use. You can select between LightDM, LXDM, or other display managers if they are installed, including GDM (which was the default display manager for regular Ubuntu systems prior to version 11.10).\nNo matter which display manager you are using, you can change the default session type for your user by logging out (click the power/configuration icon at the upper-right corner of the screen and select Log Out). Logging out brings you to the login screen, even on systems where you are automatically logged in on boot. Then you can select whatever session type you want (in this case, you'd want to select Lubuntu), and log in. Your session type will be remembered (for that user account).\nDifferent display managers put the drop-down menu used to select between session types in different places. If you have trouble finding it even after trying, you can comment or edit your question describing what the menu looks like (including its color), which will help to determine what display manager is enabled, which will make it possible to provide a detailed description of how to select your session type. But you may very well find that selecting your session type is quite easy.\nIf you select your session type and log in but you're still automatically logged in with the wrong session type, then you can disable automatic login, log out, log back in (selecting the session type you want), and re-enable automatic login. (If you don't know how to do this and searching doesn't help, please post a comment and I'll add that information to this post.)\nIf that doesn't work either, and LightDM is your display manager, see this related question. Please note that changing the global default session type will only work if it is not overridden by a user-specific preference. So if you're being logged in to a Unity session because that's the global default and there is no user-specific default, then the accepted answer there will help. But if you're being logged in to a Unity session because that's set as your user-specific session type, then you may want to manually change the user-specific default to Lubuntu (or, less likely, LXDE) using the directions in this answer.\n", "Q: Ubuntu won't boot after plugging in wireless network card I plugged a Skyr@cer Pro PCI 154 into a Ubuntu Server 10.04 LTS and tried to boot.

Depending on how your manufacturer has wired things up, there may be a BIOS switch to select between the integrated and discrete CPUs.  If there is such a BIOS option, then you'll be able to use either the Intel or nVidia card.  In this case you'll obviously need to reboot to switch GPUs, and you'll also need to do some fiddling with the video drivers - 3D won't work on the Intel GPU while the nVidia drivers are configured.\nNote: If there's an option like Detect OS Optimus Support or suchlike, you need to have this disabled.  For many boring, stupid, and annoyingly necessary reasons, linux identifies itself to the BIOS's ACPI implementation as the most recent version of Windows.  This means Windows 7, which supports Optimus (or, at least, the Windows 7 nvidia drivers support Optimus), so if the BIOS tries to detect Optimus support it will incorrectly enable it.\nAs to your unity_support_test output, I'd guess that you've either got the nvidia binary drivers installed and are using the Intel GPU or that you're using the nvidia GPU and haven't got the binary drivers installed ☺.  I don't think nouveau in 11.10 supports 3D on your nVidia card.  The contents of your /var/log/Xorg.0.log file would be instructive in debugging this.\n¹: In many of the Optimus laptops, like this T420s, only the internal display and VGA output is hooked up to the Intel GPU; the DisplayPort output is only hooked up to the nVidia card.\n", "Q: Dell Dimension 3000 goes into sleep and won't wake up I installed ubuntu 11.10 on my old desktop Dell Dimension 3000.

This is important. Now run that wubi.exe\nSome software will associate itself with the .iso extension and identify the ISO as an archive or offer to do some default action. Just select to save the ISO. Or right click on the link and select \"Save link as\" to bypass the software. If you go direct to http://releases.ubuntu.com/11.10/ there are other download options e.g. the .torrent extension which will open up in your bit torrent client. It doesn't matter where you save the ISO as long as it's in the same place as the wubi.exe of the same release.\n\nA: Did you try Wubi straight from the Ubuntu website AND make sure to pick an installation of above 15 gig? The Wubi installer has a little bit of difficulty determining bit versions, and while not normally a problem for 64 bit computers the \"program\" nature of Wubi doesnt always work well running 32 on a 64 bit machine.

Via Gnome Nautilus I can easily mount Samba shares from my Ubuntu Server.  However, these \"mounts\" are kinda of fake.  Many applications I run do not recognize that Gnome has mounted these server folders and therefore cannot open files off my server. \nIn the past I created an /etc/fstab entry and mounted them globally, the /mnt folder, but this isn't going to work as other people share my Ubuntu laptop.\nWhat's the easiest way to create a \"real\" samba mount in my (and other people's) home directory?  It's fine if its a command or a GUI application that can run when I log in.  These server folders don't have to be mounted all the time.\n\nA: *\n\n*Open your file manager, i.e. click the icon for Home Folder\n\n*Observe up at the top of the screen is the Menu for the File Manager (as opposed to at the top of its window); \n\n*Click File → Connect to Server...;  a window should open titled Connect to Server\n\n*Click into its drop-down box titled Type; choose Windows share (i.e. change from the default of Public FTP)\n\n*Enter the Server (the name if it can be resolved by DNS or its IP address\n\n*Enter the Share (i.e the items you'd otherwise see in a windows share as the Share component of '\\\\Server\\Share') \n\n*Enter into Folder the name of any particular directory on the share that you'd like the mount to position at\n\n*Enter any/optional User Details \n\n*The Share should Mount and appear in the File Manager window on the left list under Network\n\n*You might then like to create a bookmark for that mount. Again, from the File Manager menu at the top of the screen: Bookmarks → Add bookmark (after first clicking on/highlighting the share you have just mounted).\n\n\nA: Not sure if you are still looking for something easy, I just found it:\nAll the shares you have opened are mounted automatically in your home folder under /home/.gvfs.\nAny application can recognize and access the shares as if they were normal folders, as long as you point the application to the files or folders you want in /home/.gvfs\n\nA: Suppose you have a directory called mounts in your home directory in which you want various Samba shares to be mounted. Suppose further that you are specifically interested in mounting a share called sharename from a remote machine called hostname (this could also be an IP address), and on that remote machine your username is username. First, create the mount point:\nmkdir ~/mounts/sharename\nThen mount the share:\nsudo mount.cifs //hostname/sharename ~/mounts/sharename -o user=username\nIn Ubuntu 12.04 LTS and earlier, if you don't have the mount.cifs command, you can either install the cifs-utils  package, or use smbmount instead (which is, in turn, provided by the smbfs  package).\nsudo smbmount //hostname/sharename ~/mounts/sharename -o user=username\n(smbmount is not available in Ubuntu 12.10 or higher, at least so far, but you can use mount.cifs instead. Thanks to HDave for pointing this out.)\nYou may be prompted for your password on the local machine, to run the command as root. Then you'll be prompted for your password on the remote machine, to log in so you can mount the share.\n\nA: Why would you want to use Samba to access files on your Linux server? Samba is meant for accessing Windows network shares and services.\nUse sshfs instead, there is no setup necessary at all and you get \"proper\" mount points that are recognized by any application:\nsudo apt-get install sshfs\n\nMount the remote filesystem with\nsshfs user@host:/path /local/mount/point\n\nand unmount with\nfusermount -u /local/mount/point\n\n", "Q: Italics display issue My italics are displaying weirdly in a number of programs, including Firefox, Chrome and KDiff3.

I recently have upgraded my PC, my new Motherboard (ASUS M5A99X EVO) uses UEFi instead of the regular MBR option.\nI have a Ubuntu 11.10 installation that I did when I had my previous hardware (MSI MS 7267) , Ubuntu alone boots fine, and so does Windows 7, however Windows 7 is using UEFI (GPT) boot whereas Ubuntu is using MBR.\nI have my OSs in separate drives, so that GRUB2 wont' get replaced by the Windows Bootloader and viceversa, as I said both OSs boot fine on their own, but to do that I have to disconnect one drive in this case the Ubuntu drive as it prevents Windows from loading.\nNow my question is, How can I change/convert Ubuntu's drive so that instead of using MBR it uses GPT and allow Windows to boot?. \nPreferably without reinstalling the whole system or lose any data.\nAnd if I were to wipe the drive, How can I install Ubuntu in GPT, UEFI, whatever it is mode?.\nI have used gdisk to convert from MBR to GPT, but now Ubuntu can't boot seems like grub just doesn't start.\nI have re installed the OS, and the drive is GPT now by default however grup-pc is still being used instead of grub-efi.\nHow can i make Ubuntu boot from EFI?.\n\nA: This answer is incomplete; I've not tested any of this.  It's unlikely to eat any of your data, but you have been warned!\nWhat I would guess is happening here is that your BIOS is preferentially booting from legacy MBR, so poor old UEFI Windows 7 is getting overlooked.  \nOne of the nice things about UEFI is that you should no longer need to worry about Windows overwriting GRUB; they should both coexist nicely on the EFI partition.  One option would therefore be to switch to grub-efi.  Note: I'm unsure whether grub-efi understands MSDOS-style partitions; I think it does.  If it does not, this will fail to boot, and you'll need a LiveCD to recover.  In fact, have a LiveCD handy anyway!\nTo switch to grub-efi you'd want to\n\n\n*\n\n*Find your EFI partition; mount it in /boot/efi.  Add this to /etc/fstab¹\n\n*Install the grub-efi package\n\n*Switch your BIOS boot priority from UEFI and Legacy to UEFI only (or a similar option)\n\n\nThat should leave you with a UEFI-booting Ubuntu install.  If it does not, boot up your trusty LiveCD (or Ubuntu Alternate install CD - the “Fix a broken system” option is what you're after ☺), chroot into your system, and install grub-pc again.\n\n¹: More detail for this step:  You'll need to find what the Linux kernel calls your EFI system partition.  This will be something like /dev/sda2, /dev/sdb3, or such².  You'll then need to make the /boot/efi directory, and add a line to /etc/fstab.  If your EFI partition is /dev/sdb3, then you would add the following line:\n/dev/sdb3    /boot/efi    vfat    defaults    0    1\n\nOnce you run sudo mount /boot/efi you should then find that /boot/efi contains a EFI directory, with a subdirectory for Windows 7.\n\n²: Since you've got multiple hard drives it might be a good idea to find out the UUID of the partition, as that will be stable under addition/removal of harddrives whereas the /dev/sda2 name is not guaranteed not to change.  This can be done after you've finished setting everything else up, though.\nYou can find the UUID by looking in /dev/disk/by-uuid.  For example, I get:\n$ ls /dev/disk/by-uuid -lah\ntotal 0\ndrwxr-xr-x 2 root root 100 Dec  5 09:12 .\ndrwxr-xr-x 6 root root 120 Dec  5 09:12 ..\nlrwxrwxrwx 1 root root  10 Dec  5 09:12 27fae347-4c7f-45cb-92d6-5f3d410599a1 -> ../../sda3\nlrwxrwxrwx 1 root root  10 Dec  5 09:12 4405-64C8 -> ../../sda1\nlrwxrwxrwx 1 root root  10 Dec  5 09:12 5243e250-8da5-4fea-aa63-61466022661d -> ../../dm-0\n\nIn my case, I know /dev/sda1 is my EFI system partition, so I have\nUUID=4405-64C8  /boot/efi       vfat    defaults        0       1\n\nin my /etc/fstab.\n\nA: \nI have my OSs in separate drives, so that GRUB2 wont' get replaced by the Windows Bootloader and viceversa\n\nThat's ideal, so you're likely to have at least one primary partition free in the partition table.\n\nNow my question is, How can I change/convert Ubuntu's drive so that instead of using MBR it uses GPT and allow Windows to boot?\n\nYou don't have to convert MBR to GPT to do UEFI booting, just create a primary FAT partition, install the grub-efi-amd64-bin package and follow the instructions in Add an ESP to an existing installation with MBR which should work with current releases of Ubuntu.\n\nA: Table of contents:\n\n\n*\n\n*Terminology\n\n*Converting\n\n*Configuring (+ Dual boot)\n\n\n\nTerminology\nBIOS = Basic Input/Output System\n(U)EFI = (Unified) Extensible Firmware Interface\nMBR = Master Boot Record\nGPT = GUID Partition Table\nUEFI / EFI / BIOS = Firmware interface\nMBR / GPT = How the computer knows (per hard disk) what partitions are on the\ndrive and how to boot from them.\nUEFI / BIOS\nA firmware interface is the way that the firmware (the software inside \ndevices) and operating system interact. It initialises the hardware then runs\nthe operating system and ensures that the operating system drivers can operate\n the hardware.\nThe BIOS has been the usual firmware interface that has been used. The UEFI is\na newer interface that has several features, such as being faster, having a GUI\nand being able to start the network card and get an ip address. UEFI replaces\nEFI. (Those developing EFI saw that there were others doing something similar\nand so joined them, bringing the ideas of EFI with them. This then became UEFI).\nA BIOS requires the bootloader to be at the start of the disk, however a UEFI\nuses a partition for this and can choose among multiple boot loaders to use.\nMBR / GPT + GRUB\nThe MBR is a section of code at the start of the disk that contains a boot\nloader (for the BIOS), as well as the partition map and a unique disk identifier. \nTo install GRUB onto a disk with a MBR, GRUB places a small program in the MBR to\nload the rest of GRUB from another part of the disk. (This is done because the\nMBR is too small to contain all of GRUB). The space that is chosen is space\nbetween the MBR and the first partition, which usually exists.\nGPT is a standard for how the partitons are specified. It does have a 'protective'\nMBR, however this is only for allowing BIOS based computers to boot and stop\ntools that only know about MBR from trying to trash GPT. It can have \n(How GPT is handled depends on whether it is booting using a BIOS (or UEFI system\nin BIOS emulation mode) or UEFI. I will focus on UEFI as it relates to the question).\nBoot loaders for operating systems are stored in a partion called EFI System\nPartiton, that is formatted (usually) with FAT32. This is where GRUB is installed.\nConverting\nFirst...\nWe are playing around with the partition table, so guaranteed safety is not\npossible. It is a risky operation. However, the method should not lose data.\nOthers coming across this: Do not use on Apple Macs.\nNow...\nYou will need to do this on a live CD (or another linux installation installed\nto a different disk.)\nWhen dealing with GPT disks, we need to use a GPT aware program. 'GPT fdisk' is\na good tool to use and what I will be using. It can be called gptfdisk or\ngdisk depending on distribution (Ubuntu calles it gdisk). Parted (and Gparted)\nis also GPT aware, so can 'safely' be used with GPT disks.\nTo convert you need to:\n\n\n*\n\n*Resize partitions to fit GPT data and EFI system partition.\n\n*Convert the disk and add partitions\n\n*Install GRUB to EFI system partition.\n\n\n1) Resize partition\nUse parted (command line) or gparted (GUI) to resize the first and last\npartition.

Roughly how long should an install usually take?\nI am installing Ubuntu 11.10 and I was stuck at partitioning the drive (1TB) for over 2 hours.\nNow I'm stuck at creating the ext4 file system and it's been that way for over 30 minutes.\nAre these excessive amounts of time to be waiting? Should I interpret these long waits as an indication that something isn't right?\n\nA: Partitioning only takes a few minutes, tops. Try burning another install CD, and check that your hard drive connections are good. You can also boot with the CD into a Live CD session and format the drive that way. Then reboot and install normally.\nDon't worry about the 8GB RAM. Ubuntu will detect this at install and automatically enable Physical Address Extensions (PAE) if you are installing 32-bit. This lets you use up to 64GB of RAM. There are still some limitations, but they are minor and you can read about them at the link.\nBest to ask only one question per post, so this might be closed. Don't worry too much about it though.\n\nA: Depending on your computer's specifications and the maximum download speed from your ISP a full installation of Ubuntu from start to finish with the options of Download updates while installing Ubuntu and Install third-party software selected could take anywhere from 10 minutes to an hour. Some stages of the Ubuntu installation process go faster than others. The longest two stages are downloading updates and unpacking and installing packages.\nBeing stuck at at creating the ext4 filesystem usually means that there is something unusual about the hard drive or its partitioning that would require you to manually partition it by selecting the Something else option at the Installation type screen of the Ubuntu installer.\n\n", "Q: Drush add aliases for ubuntu drush? I natively installed ubuntu with the package manager through apt-get install drush . \nAfter a find i discovered that they're natively installed at /usr/share/drush. \nMy question is the following: is it possible to add aliases with the ubuntu brewed drush? If so where? in the /usr/share/drush/ folder?\nThe ubuntu version seems to be missing the example folder as well as some other files: ini, topic files.\n\nA: For instructions on creating aliases, see drush topic docs-aliases, which can also be found at http://drupalcode.org/project/drush.git/blob/refs/heads/7.x-4.x:/examples/example.aliases.drushrc.php\nThe best place to put global aliases would be in /etc/drush; user-specific aliases should go in $HOME/.drush.\n\nA: You can create a folder in your drush folder called 'aliases'. In that folder you can create a file aliases.drushrc.php (or project specific -> myproject.aliases.drushrc.php) and i guess it should work then. so first try /usr/share/drush/aliases/aliases.drushrc.php, and see if that works.\nIf you put the drush location in your path, you can place the alias file in a drush folder in your home directory\nthere's more linux specific info in the readme.txt\nhttp://drupalcode.org/project/drush.git/blob/refs/heads/7.x-4.x:/README.txt\n", "Q: Does SafeNet Token and Openvpn work on 11.10?

If you are not trying to boot off this new disk, you are unlikely to run into any compatibility problems.\nUsing GParted, you can do this by going into Device->Create Partition Table and select \"gpt\" from the list.\n\nA: You can also use gdisk. In my case, it was able to convert a disk with existing partitions and data from MBR to GPT, keeping everything intact. However, YMMV.\nYou can find more information about it on the ArchLinux forums. The process looks something like this:\n$ sudo gdisk /dev/sda\nGPT fdisk (gdisk) version 0.8.5\n\nPartition table scan:\n MBR: MBR only\n BSD: not present\n APM: not present\n GPT: not present\n\n***************************************************************\nFound invalid GPT and valid MBR; converting MBR to GPT format.\nTHIS OPERATION IS POTENTIALLY DESTRUCTIVE!

Use a 120GB+ SDD pair in RAID1 for boot & and 2 partitions / and /home. They become your md0 and md1 devices. RAID10 device will be /home/DATA or /home/whateveryouwant. You can put multiple partitions on the RAID10 device using GPARTED once the MD device is created mounting each device to /home/whateveryouwant.\nSteps:\n\n\n*\n\n*Use GPARTED setting partition tables of >2TB drives to GPT. Partition all drives for RAID10 with one EXT4 parttition using the entire device. Apply the partition then set the RAID flag on.\n\n*Assuming 4 +2TB drives on partitions sda1, sdb1, sdc1, sdd1 (any number will work with 4,6,8 being fastest) \nuse: mdadm -v --create /dev/md2 --level=raid10 --raid-devices=4 /dev/sda1 /dev/sdb1 /dev/sdc1 /dev/sdd1\n\n*It will take a while to sync the raid so set up a watch to wait for the md0 to finish. enter: watch -n30 cat /proc/mdstat\n\n*When raid finishes RESTART\n\n*Return to GPARTED when system is back and look for your md2.  Probably not there but you will find md126 or md127 etc.  that matches one half of the combined drive space. if using 4 3TB parttions will show about 6TB (half of the actual 12TB).\n\n*Define the new md  device (md127 in my case) with a new partition table as GPT Apply it!\n\n*Add 1 or more partitions as ext4. No flags and label if you like. APPLY.\n\n*Start terminal,  enter: fdisk -l (you should have a md127 device with partitions labeled md127p1 if you have 1 partition, md127p2 etc... if you assigned more than 1.\n\n*Enter mkdir /home/DATA          or whatever in place of DATA\n\n*Use: ls -l /dev/disk/by-uuid to display uuid's for devices to copy md127p1 uuid later into fstab\n\n*Enter: mount -t ext4 /dev/md127p1 /home/DATA\nthen enter: ls -asl /home/DATA (to view directory) should have only one entry: lost+found\nif there you can add mount to /etc/fstab      using: gksudo gedit /etc/fstab\n\n*Enter a line before the swap line uuid=[uuid number for md127p1]  /home/DATA  ext4 defaults 0 2\n(no brackets on actual entry, just copythe uuid number from terminal display  (from line 10. command result))\nuse Ctrl+C to exit gedit \n\n*Use: mount -a\nTo mount all fstab devices\n\n\nYou now have a really large RAID10 drive called  in /home/DATA. \nTo USE IT:\nit is owned by root and group root. \nto change owner use:  sudo chown youruserid /home/DATA\nto change group use: sudo chgrp  users /home/DATA\n", "Q: Problem after upgrading from 10.04 to 11.10 on a Mac I've just upgrade from Ubuntu 10.04 to 11.10 on my Mac(OS X) but after it has restarted, it would not open after selecting the Ubuntu launcher.

What can I do to recuperate the ubuntu partition and make it work?\nThank you.\n\nA: Even if I am sure you have done it already, my first advice would be to wait even longer to see if the boot process works after a longer time. Then, what happens when you type Ctrl+Alt+F1?\nAre you able to run a Live CD of Ubuntu? This would permit you to get your data back and to repair your installation.\n", "Q: $local_fs not including all drives This is a refinement of a question I asked yesterday, the product of deeper research I have done since.\nThe script that starts CrashPlan has, as it should, a hard dependency on $local_fs in its LSB Required-Start entry.  The problem is coming about when this dependency is satisfied without the USB volume being mounted.  Therefore CrashPlan thinks it has to create its backup destination and the conflicts begin.\nMy understanding of $local_fs is that everything in mtab will be mounted before it is satisfied.  Is that not the case?  Are there options I can add to the mtab entry to change this behavior for the volume in question? \n\nA: If I recall correctly, USB drives are mounted by udev after virtual-filesystems (an Upstart signal), not as part of $local_fs.\nSo one solution is a bug against CrashPlan - it's assuming the drive you want to backup is not USB.\nA workaround is to change the dependency (or to add a second) is the CrashPlan init script.\nAnother (easier) workaround is to add a 'sleep 60' or other pause to the CrashPlan init script. Or to simply renumber the symlinks so they run later.\n\nA: Upstart should be able to handle this if you convert to a standard upstart script.

The 9600 has a DVi and HDMI output on it. Although neither of my monitors has a HDMI port, a cheap HDMI - DVI cable has meant I didn't need a new card after all.\nInstalling the current version of the NVIDIA drivers gives access to all the settings I need to enable both monitors from the one card, so I'm happily typing this looking at a lovely wide display spread over two screens.\nNow there's just the small matter of migrating everything I do from Windows over to Linux! puts beer on ice\n", "Q: can Unity dashboard search the phrase approximately?

I have tried this actually on 3 Ideacentres, Win7 works, and both Ubuntu 11.10 don't.\nThis german website suggests to download 2 packages (http://de.archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/pool/main/n/network-manager/network-manager_0.8-0ubuntu3_amd64.deb and http://de.archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/pool/main/n/network-manager-applet/network-manager-gnome_0.8-0ubuntu3_amd64.deb) and to \nsudo apt-get remove --purge network-manager network-manager-gnome. \nBut somehow, the dependencies on the two files are not met, and without the network, and as it was a new install, I just reinstalled Ubuntu once more as it just such an easy thing to do.\nI have searched through http://packages.ubuntu.com/oneiric/net/ and have found the 2 packages the user suggested, which I assume were more up to date(http://packages.ubuntu.com/oneiric/net/network-manager and http://packages.ubuntu.com/oneiric/net/network-manager-gnome), but for the formats, I am not sure which one would be best and easiest to install... .dsc, .tar.bz2, .tar.gz ?\nAnd even then, what to do with the files? I found How do I install tar bz2 and gz files?  but I am guessing Softwarecenter would be out of the question?\nAnd lastly! If you know of any other ways that could work, I am all ears! :)\nThanks for any pointers!\nADDITION: \n##@##:~$ cat /var/lib/NetworkManager/NetworkManager.state\n[main]\nNetworkingEnabled=true\nWirelessEnabled=true\nWWANEnabled=true\nWimaxEnabled=true\n##@##:~$ cat /var/lib/NetworkManager/NetworkManager.state\n\n[main]\nNetworkingEnabled=true\nWirelessEnabled=true\nWWANEnabled=true\nWimaxEnabled=true\n##@##:~$ lspci -nnk | grep -i net\n01:08.0 Ethernet controller [0200]: Intel Corporation 82552 10/100 Network Connection [8086:10fe] (rev 02)\n##@##:~$ ifconfig -a\neth0      Link encap:Ethernet  HWaddr 38:60:77:71:b5:89  \n          BROADCAST MULTICAST  MTU:1500  Metric:1\n          RX packets:0 errors:0 dropped:0 overruns:0 frame:0\n          TX packets:0 errors:0 dropped:0 overruns:0 carrier:0\n          collisions:0 txqueuelen:1000 \n          RX bytes:0 (0.0 B)  TX bytes:0 (0.0 B)\n\nlo        Link encap:Local Loopback  \n          inet addr:127.0.0.1  Mask:255.0.0.0\n          inet6 addr: ::1/128 Scope:Host\n          UP LOOPBACK RUNNING  MTU:16436  Metric:1\n          RX packets:0 errors:0 dropped:0 overruns:0 frame:0\n          TX packets:0 errors:0 dropped:0 overruns:0 carrier:0\n          collisions:0 txqueuelen:0 \n          RX bytes:0 (0.0 B)  TX bytes:0 (0.0 B)\n\nwlan0     Link encap:Ethernet  HWaddr 74:2f:68:28:00:a7  \n          inet addr:192.168.178.66  Bcast:192.168.178.255  Mask:255.255.255.0\n          inet6 addr: fe80::762f:68ff:fe28:a7/64 Scope:Link\n          UP BROADCAST RUNNING MULTICAST  MTU:1500  Metric:1\n          RX packets:7477 errors:0 dropped:53 overruns:0 frame:0\n          TX packets:5336 errors:0 dropped:0 overruns:0 carrier:0\n          collisions:0 txqueuelen:1000 \n          RX bytes:6669541 (6.6 MB)  TX bytes:1033545 (1.0 MB)\n\n##@##:~$ dmesg | egrep 'eth0|e100|firm'\n[    1.230481] e100: Intel(R) PRO/100 Network Driver, 3.5.24-k2-NAPI\n[    1.230490] e100: Copyright(c) 1999-2006 Intel Corporation\n[    1.230616] e100 0000:01:08.0: PCI INT A -> GSI 20 (level, low) -> IRQ 20\n[    1.258225] e100 0000:01:08.0: PME# disabled\n[    1.259625] e100 0000:01:08.0: eth0: addr 0xfcfff000, irq 20, MAC addr 38:60:77:71:b5:89\n[   17.468302] r8712u: Loading firmware from \"rtlwifi/rtl8712u.bin\"\n##@##:~$ lsmod | grep e100\ne100                   37213  0 \n##@##:~$ cat /etc/network/interfaces\nauto lo\niface lo inet loopback\n\n##@##:~$ ping -c 4 192.168.178.1\nPING 192.168.178.1 (192.168.178.1) 56(84) bytes of data.\n64 bytes from 192.168.178.1: icmp_req=1 ttl=64 time=1.20 ms\n64 bytes from 192.168.178.1: icmp_req=2 ttl=64 time=1.20 ms\n64 bytes from 192.168.178.1: icmp_req=3 ttl=64 time=1.14 ms\n64 bytes from 192.168.178.1: icmp_req=4 ttl=64 time=1.24 ms\n\n--- 192.168.178.1 ping statistics ---\n4 packets transmitted, 4 received, 0% packet loss, time 3003ms\nrtt min/avg/max/mdev = 1.142/1.197/1.247/0.050 ms\n\n`\n##@##:~$ sudo lshw -c network\n[sudo] password for ##: \n  *-network DISABLED      \n       description: Ethernet interface\n       product: 82552 10/100 Network Connection\n       vendor: Intel Corporation\n       physical id: 8\n       bus info: pci@0000:01:08.0\n       logical name: eth0\n       version: 02\n       serial: 38:60:77:71:b5:89\n       size: 100Mbit/s\n       capacity: 100Mbit/s\n       width: 32 bits\n       clock: 33MHz\n       capabilities: pm bus_master cap_list ethernet physical tp mii 10bt 10bt-fd 100bt 100bt-fd autonegotiation\n       configuration: autonegotiation=on broadcast=yes driver=e100 driverversion=3.5.24-k2-NAPI duplex=full firmware=N/A latency=64 link=no maxlatency=56 mingnt=8 multicast=yes port=MII speed=100Mbit/s\n       resources: irq:20 memory:fcfff000-fcffffff ioport:dc00(size=64)\n  *-network\n       description: Wireless interface\n       physical id: 1\n       bus info: usb@1:1\n       logical name: wlan0\n       serial: 74:2f:68:28:00:a7\n       capabilities: ethernet physical wireless\n       configuration: broadcast=yes driver=r8712u ip=192.168.178.66 multicast=yes wireless=IEEE 802.11bg\n\n\nA: The 'german website' had suggested installing packages that were new at the time, but are old now. The same packages in 11.10 are of higher versions then those suggested. That's why you got the 'unmet dependencies' error.\nIf you still need to download and manually install packages from http://packages.ubuntu.com/, get the .debs instead of tars. There are links for 32 and 64bit debs at the bottom of the network-manager-gnome page.b\nThe deb packages are installable by simple double clicking.\nLastly, if you want to troubleshoot the cable problem, post the outputs of the following, as suggested at the 'german site':\ncat /var/lib/NetworkManager/NetworkManager.state\nlspci -nnk | grep -i net\nifconfig -a\ndmesg | egrep 'eth0|e100|firm'\nlsmod | grep e100\ncat /etc/network/interfaces\nping -c 4 192.168.178.1\n\nI don't know any German, but did installing those packages solve the problem for the poster?\n\nA: There is a ppa for NM and lists some packages. I would try to install all of them blindly, assuming they are all dependencies(hoping they don't depend on something else). Then I would install NM and after my system is running I would autoremove unwanted packages.\nAlternatively you can download tarball here and then try to compile it. From there dependency library will keep arising (may be in configure stage?) and you will be installing until it works.\n", "Q: Banshee crashes consistently - is there a fix?

I read this post yesterday on Google+ that talked about the increased smoothness of animations due to the adaption of OpenGL ES 2.0 in the version of Compiz in Ubuntu 12.04 Alpha 1. I was curious if anyone knew what graphics chipsets support this and will see the improvements.\nThanks,\n\nA: the OpenGL ES 2.0 specification are written considering the OpenGL 2.0 specification with some variations. If your purpose is to detect which version of OpenGL you have available in your video card you can use the mesa utils:\nsudo apt-get install mesa-utils\n\nwhen the installation is complete run\nglxinfo | grep -i opengl\n\nthe output of this command gives you information about the OpenGL profile available in your video card, since, as i just say, the OpenGL ES 2.0 are basically OpenGL 2.0 with minor modifications if you have a profile number greater then 2 you probably can experience the new interface without problems; the real problems is that some feature of the ES 2.0 are designed differently from the original 2.0, so if this developer does not gives more information we are not able to give a precise answer.\nGenerally speaking the same profile is usually used in all modern web-browser except Safari, so if you can play some GL demo in your web broser you are probably fine with ES 2.0 in every scenario.\nThe answer is also tricky because with some OpenGL version you can create a layer of abstraction and assign all the calculus to the CPU (meaning that you can play even without a dedicated GPU, or the required GPU for the hardware acceleration version), like in some older games where you can choose between \"hardware acceleration\" or \"software emulation\" in the graphics settings; if the dev team can't provide much more data is almost impossible to give a correct answer, it's only possible to give to you an idea of what OpenGL ES 2.0 are and how they are used and what are their general requirements.\n", "Q: Converting mp4 to mp3 I have a video I need to convert to mp3 (from the command line - not GUI): video.mp4\nI tried:\nffmpeg -i -b 192 video.mp4 video.mp3\n\nwith no success.

I installed Ubuntu 11.10 on my laptop alongside Windows 7, and the GRUB screen was purple. After that, I installed Ubuntu 10.10 and the GRUB screen was black. When I decided to uninstall Ubuntu 10.10, the bootloader didn't change and I was greeted by a black Terminal screen. How do I remove the Ubuntu 10.10 GRUB bootloader and use the Ubuntu 11.10 one?\n\nA: This is what I think has happened. It will help you to learn from the experience as we all learn one way or another.\nWhen you installed 11.10 it put its Grub into the MBR (Master Boot Record) of the hard disk and looked for its configuration files in the 11.10 file system. And so you get a purple background to the Grub Menu.\nThen you installed 10.10 and it put its Grub into the MBR and so you got a black background to the Grub menu.\nNow that you have uninstalled 10.10 you get a Grub prompt because the 10.10 Grub is the controlling Grub and it cannot find its configuration files in the 10.10 file system.\nIf you had run sudo update-grub from 11.10 you would not now have this problem for that command would have made the 11.10 Grub as the controlling Grub.

Is it possible to open a browser window at a given size/location on screen via a shell script ?\nI've seen examples of launching Firefox, setting the window size via command line. I've also seen it written up as non working as a Firefox bug. Are there any alternative browsers that will do this that run on 10.04?\n\nA: Yes, this is possible with devilspie (As I am using this myself now). Except, this program runs as daemon and do not require shell script.\nIt handles application windows' border decoration, behaviour (sticky, always on top), window geometry, position and states (maximize, fullscreen) based on matched traits. It can control not only Firefox, but almost any graphical applications at launch.\nTo use this, you will have to create the configuration files for each application you want to control. You can find practical examples in this fullest documentation.\nIf you need GUI to write the configuration files, there's gDevilspie. Newer releases of Ubuntu includes this in Software Center, but you can download directly from its project page.\nOn second thought, perhaps you are actually looking into \"tiling window manager\"--which is another different approach.\n\nA: On Ubuntu, I believe Firefox makes use of GTK+, which has options for setting the window metrics. Whether you can do this from another program (e.g. after Firefox loads) is another question, as it has security implications.\nThis is not really a (simple) answer, but a research direction: you'd have to read the GTK+ documentation, and maybe write up a program using their API in C, Python, or whatever.\n", "Q: Can't enable Ralink RT2561/RT61 wireless card I have been reading various other posts on the matter but none of the solutions are working so I thought I might as well ask.\nJust installed Ubuntu Server 11.04 on my old Dell Optiplex 330.

Once you do you could use gparted (it's in the Ubuntu Software Center) to partition the drive.  Then make sure you install onto the right partition on the usb stick/flash drive.  Hopefully the whole drive doesn't get reformatted by the \"Usb disk creator\".  But even if it does you have it backed up so just put you're data back onto the partition not used by Ubuntu's installer.\nThe \"Disk Creator\" in 10.04 is under the Administration menu.  I haven't used 10.04 in a while but if I remember correctly it was labeled \"USB Start-up disk creator\" or something close. Download the ISO (that's the format that Ubuntu downloads in) onto your hard drive and use the \"usb disk creator\" to install it onto your flash drive/usb stick.\n", "Q: Is this really the only way to simply put a link to a web page on my desktop?

So, I got a new computer (to work on it), and installed Ubuntu 11.10 on it. As my home computer is not strong enough (I'm using some strange mix of Xubuntu/Ubuntu/Kubuntu there), this was my first real contact with Unity.\nAnd somehow (I don't really remember how) I managed to have my favorite browser (Opera) on the screen, but neither in the side bar (which, as I understand, should contain icons for all currently running programs, as well as some icons to start more programs), nor in the Alt+Tab window list.\n\nThe green mark is proof that the browser window in front is really Opera, while the yellow marks show how Opera is missing in both those lists.\nClosing and restarting Opera seems not to help. In this screenshot, I have only Opera and two terminal windows (one out of sight), but normally I have enough windows to fill the whole two screens, which makes it a bit difficult to find the Opera window if it is obscured.\nWhat could have caused this, and how I get my icon back?\n(Actually, I'm considering changing the window manager completely, but I'll first try to solve this problem and see if I can get used to Unity.)\n\nA: Okay, it looks like this solved itself by switching the computer off on Friday and switching it on on Monday.\nIf someone has an idea on how I did this (and how to avoid it in future), I'm still interested.\n", "Q: New upstream version of gnome-mplayer.

But the good news is that Ubuntu is never more than 6 months late: It will come out in the next release. You can manually install the newer version (from an early or Debian-specific package, or from source) while you wait.\nIncidentally, I know of a program (wesnoth) which managed to find its latest version into Ubuntu's repos by making a new package. The old package (at the time) was called wesnoth, and offered version 1.6; the new program was called wesnoth-1.8.\nThat ensured that anyone who's depending on the bugs or features of the previous version get to keep them, while others consciously upgrade.\n", "Q: Can't update/Dont know admin password My daughter got a computer at a yard sale with an old version of ubuntu. When I try to update, it asks for admin password. It also says version no longer supported.\n\nA: I would suggest downloading an ISO on a working computer and just re-installing Ubuntu. Who knows what kinds of problems you may have inherited with a used machine.\n\nA: This is kind of a two-pronged question, but it can be answered with one solution.\nThe solution would be to install a newer version of Ubuntu.  When it says \"Version no longer supported\", it means the version of Ubuntu that is installed has reached its End of Life, that is to say no more updates will be provided.\nI would install either 10.04.3 LTS or 11.10.  This would wipe the data on the old system, replace with new passcodes, and allow you to update the software.\n\nA: I'd definitely recommend doing a clean install of Ubuntu.  Grab the latest at ubuntu.com, put it on a CD (with Brasero, which is probably already installed on the computer), backup your stuff, and reinstall.  \n\nA: An older computer may or may not work with a fresh install of Ubuntu.\nThe safest option would be Ubuntu 10.04.3 LTS, but would need to know exact hardware to know better.\nTwo solutions:\nOption A. If the computer is already running Ubuntu 10.04.3 LTS (or 10.04.x), then just replace system password.  If the Ubuntu version is earlier, stick with option Option B.\nsee: How do I reset a lost administrative password?\nThen do the updates, and see how well computer is performing.  Take a note of which drivers, devices, and applications are installed.  If all is well, you can proceed with a fresh install (Option B).\nOption B.

By default, this will only search your files (your home directory), but you can tell it to search in other folders with the Look in folder dropdown. This will only search on file names. If you want to search inside file, see the Beagle application.\n\nA: From the way you've written your question, it sounds like you just want to know the name of the folder containing a file.\nIf that's the case, then you can use search in nautilus and then right click a file to select it's properties. The properties window will contain the path to the file.\nIf you're talking about opening the containing folder from within nautilus, that's currently not possible, as discussed in this question.\n", "Q: Everything opens dolphin file manager windows Every kind of file I open through ubuntu dash or via firefox download window instead of directly open the right application it launches a dolphin window straight to the path of the file and just then the default application is opened. \nThis is very annoying so I decided to unistall dolphin and now when i try to open a file in dash or firefox i got this message \"Failed to execute child process \"dolphin\" (No such file or directory).\"\nI hope i was clear enough as english is not my primary language.\n\nA: Go to Tools->Options->Applications in Firefox to manage how files you download in Firefox are handled.

Please bear with me as I am still figuring out how to use gnome-shell. My question concerns how to use the integrated chat correctly. I have the following questions:\n1) When people chat with me, it pops up as a notification on the hidden bar at the bottom of the screen, and then that chat stays there so I can access it later. How do I initiate a chat in this manner, without opening an empathy window? What I have been doing is \n\n\n*\n\n*Hitting super key   \n\n*Typing in the person's name, which brings up contacts   \n\n*Initiate the chat using empathy   \n\n*Immediately close the chat window   \n\n*When the person responds, it comes through as a notification. I then proceed to interact with the chat this way.\n\n\n2) What is the keyboard shortcut for bringing up the notifications bar? Ideally, I would like to have the following experience\n\n\n*\n\n*Use some keyboard shortcut to bring up notifications\n\n*Begin typing the name of the notification that I wish to investigate, and have the matching work in a fuzzy manner, much like Ido mode's buffer switching matching in Emacs\n\n*When then right name is matched, I hit enter and then bring up the chat with that person as that popup notification.\n\n\nAre these behaviours supported? If not, I would be happy to work on implementing them. I am an experienced programmer, but not familiar with gnome-shell. If someone would point me in the right direction in terms of if this behaviour is supported, or where in the gnome-shell framework would I add to to get this behaviour, I would really appreciate it.\nThanks!\n\nA: Keyboard shortcuts can be set in system settings > keyboard > shortcuts. \nBy default Super+M shows the notification bar. \nIn addition I've set Ctrl+Alt+E to show me the empathy main window.

You can find this out by running the 'check cd' option you get during boot.

However I can't find any documentation anywhere about what ro does and why it's there, even though it appears in most examples of grub start up code.\nWhere can I find documentation about ro?\nI assume it means read only. Though docs would ease my mind.\n\nA: ro means 'mount the file system as read-only'.\nthe reason this is done is because fsck (the file system checker) should never be run on a read/write file system.\nit's a default for a very good reason, and i would be very wary of changing it.\n\nA: Boot options can be handled by either the kernel itself or the init script in an initrd/initramfs.\nThe options that are handled as part of the 'vanilla' kernel are documented on this page (can also be found other places as well, but that was the first one I found). The boot parameters handled by Ubuntu's initramfs can be found here.\nThe vt.handoff parameter is a bit weird. What it does is explained in this askubuntu answer:\n\nFor a smooth boot process, we want to display something other than a\n  black screen as early as possible and leave it on screen until the\n  desktop is ready.  vt.handoff=7 is part of this.  We have the boot\n  loader display an aubergine background (we wanted to have an Ubuntu\n  logo as well, but there are problems with different aspect ratios\n  between the boot loader and the real system, so this is the next best\n  thing).  vt.handoff=7 then causes the kernel to maintain the current\n  contents of video memory on virtual terminal 7, which is a new\n  \"transparent\" VT type.  The first time that the kernel is told to\n  switch away from VT 7, either from Plymouth or manually (Alt-F1,\n  etc.), these contents are lost and VT 7 reverts to text mode.\n\nI could only find a description of it from bug reports, but this bug report tells it's origins: \n\nvt.handoff is a module parameter introduced in an Ubuntu-specific SAUCE patch by\n  Andy Whitcroft, ...It was written expressly for use in the Ubuntu boot process...\n\nBecause of this, any documentation would probably be with the module source (if such documentation exists).\n", "Q: How to remove all associated files and configuration settings of an app installed through 'force architecture' command A few weeks ago I installed a 32 bit .deb file through the 'force architecture' command (on my 64bit notebook), however the procedure was unsuccessful and I used the apt-get purgecommand to uninstall the app. It seems there are some leftovers of the app I uninstalled which has now broken system update.

It has a number of comfort functions, e.g. you can:\n\n\n*\n\n*freeze the presentation for your viewers while browsing through your slides\n\n*display an overview of all of your slides\n\n*turn off the presentation screen\n\n*set up a timer and be alerted when your presentation time is up\n\n\nIf you look through the website you will also find key configurations for common presentation remotes and other nifty ways of customizing the application.\nHere are some screenshots:\n\n\n\nA: Check system settings (gear icon on top right) and select \"Monitors\".

My version of vim has many plugins installed: ruby, php, python etc. \nWhen I invoke vim from the terminal, I have to wait ~ 10 seconds before vim finishes starting.\nIs it possible to have it load when Ubuntu starts?\n\nA: Yes, but I don't see using it without a terminal (unless you use gVim). You can add it to .bashrc in your home directory ( or .bash_profile under some circumstances ).\nSee https://help.ubuntu.com/community/AddingProgramToSessionStartup for instructions on adding startup applications in Ubuntu. The command would be one of the following:\ngvim #vim GUI version\n\ngnome-terminal --command 'vim' #execute ONLY vim in a terminal\n\ngnome-terminal #start a terminal, and vim will load if it's in .bashrc\n\nReplace \"gnome-terminal\" and \"--command\" with your favored terminal emulator and syntax for running commands on startup, respectively.\n", "Q: What is the easiest way to install PostGIS? What is the easiest way to install postgis on Ubuntu Server 11.10?\napt-get install ...\n\n\nA: this package is not available in the official repository so you can use a ppa for a quick and dirty installation.\nhttps://wiki.ubuntu.com/UbuntuGIS\nfor Ubuntu 11.10 Oneiric the packages are only available in the unstable version of this PPA, to install and use this ppa\nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:ubuntugis/ubuntugis-unstable\n\nto update your software list and install the package you are interested of\nsudo apt-get update; sudo apt-get install postgis\n\n\nA: As noted in Micro's answer, your best bet for installing PostGIS is the UbuntuGIS PPA. As of the time I'm writing they are distributing PostgreSQL 9.1 and PostGIS 2.0.1. Starting with these versions it became much easier to set up a PostGIS database.\nOnce PostGIS is installed, how do you create a PostGIS database?

After a reboot, however, the indicator icon disappeared. I tried to purge and reinstall IBus to no avail. Then I whitelisted IBus and restarted Unity. That brought up an icon, but it is large and ugly and doesn't fit with my icon theme--it is definitely not the same icon I had before. How can I restore the original IBus icon?\n\nA: Search for 'Keyboard Input methods' in the dash and open it. You would now end up with a IBus preference window.\nThere, tick the checkbox next to 'Show icon on system tray'. See the attached image for clarification.\n\nAfter you enable the checkbox, you would have an IBus indicator in the top panel.\n\nA: I installed Petra with iBus for Chinese and Japanese input last night for a friend and the same problem happened. I'n not sure how repeatable it is, but some of the problems and things that seemed to help are:\n\n\n*\n\n*The iBus language icon didn't always appear in the tray. This might have been solved by going back to the logon screen and changing from Cinnamon to instead always use MATE. \n\n*When the icon did appear, it often showed the wrong icon (keyboard when it was doing Chinese, and Chinese when it was doing English input, and I had to select the wrong one to get what I wanted sometimes. Something is not consistent about the state and the icons.\n\n*I also changed the activation key from \"Super\" (whatever that is) to Ctrl before anything works. Somewhere I read that \"Super\" is the \"Windows\" key, but pressing that brings up the start menu, so something is messed up and confusing there. There are some japanese or kanji words on some keys on the japanese VAIO laptop keyboard that he has, but none of those seemed to act like Super, so that's when I changed to CTRL. \nI hope this helps track down the problem. \nIt's way too complicated for non-technical multilingual users who just wants common applications like editing of office-compatible documents, reading pdfs, web browsing, skype, email, calculator... \nIt seems the ideal interface would allow clicking multiple languages at installation or in the language settings, and automatically determine the dependencies and install the language packs including relevant IMEs simply by checking the languages off in the installation or in the language preferences. And the language preferences are hidden in Petra where a typical non-technical user wouldn't venture. Whether it uses iBus or something else should not be the concern of the person using it unless they're technical enough to look for an option to choose an alternative. First assume the user is not technical. Another thing that should be there is a checkbox for supporting all languages so that general use computers in public places like university libraries where people may visit from all around the world, the language packs would all already be installed with the appropriate IMEs. \nI also didn't see a way to use the trackpad to enter characters by recognizing handwriting strokes. (that would be important if he were cantonese speaker like people from Hong Kong who don't always know the mainland chinese input methods). Maybe it doesn't exist. There's also no way I could see to write pinyin tone marks over ASCII vowels.

Gnome2's gnome-panel also does not work on the twinview setup; it spans between both monitors, but it does not redraw (ex: the clock never changes). In addition, when I maximize an application, it spans both monitors, which is not acceptable.\nWhen I enable Xinerama for my setup, gnome-panel no longer spans two monitors, and applications maximize as expected, but compiz does not work, as X11 compositing is not available. The lack of desktop compositing causes problems with dragging windows between screens (redraws take forever).\nIs there anything I can do to fix these issues without opting for different graphics cards?\n\nA: If only have two monitors linked on twinview, but I use to have similar problems with the compiz defaults. Here's how I solved it, and I think it should work for you:\nInstall CompizConfig Settings Manager sudo apt-get install compizconfig-settings-manager and run it using ccsm.\nIn the list of options find Place Windows in the Window Management section.\n\nChange the Placement Mode to Smart and the Multi Output Mode to Place across all outputs.\n\nA: Compiz does not support two separate graphics cards in one machine. Since Unity depends on Compiz, it will simply not work.\nThe solution I used was to go with KDE instead. It's a far more mature window manager, so you don't lose anything by switching to it.

If you download iso file with ubuntu you will get something like this:\nubuntu-10.04.3-server-amd64.iso\nubuntu-11.10-desktop-amd64.iso\n\nEvery part in the file name is pretty clean to me, except 'amd'.\nSo I have the following questions. \nWhy is there the 'amd' string in the filename? \nWhat other kind of strings in the filename can be found instead of 'amd'?\n\nA: AMD beat Intel to adding 64 bit capability to it's X86 line chips, at a time when Intel was pushing the Itanium chip as the future for 64 bit computing in conjunction with HP. \nIntel later licensed and implemented the AMD extensions in it's own line of chips.\nThe amd64 version will work on both AMD's and Intel's current generation chips (other than Itanium, which is largely dead except for some HP servers/workstations). That is if you wish to use 64 bits. It just gives credit to AMD for getting there first.\n\nA: It's merely a convention due to the fact that AMD created the 64-bit extensions to the x86 (Intel 386/486/Pentium) instruction set.  At that time, Intel was pushing Itanium as the only 64-bit solution, and Intel didn't copy AMD's extensions until it was clear that AMD had created something that was being used widely.  The #define AMD64 was used to distingish this 64-bit instruction set from Intel's Itanium instruction set.\n\nA: Sometimes these are referred to as x86_64 as well, which has a slight Intel bias.  The x86 name has its roots in the Intel 8086 processor line.\n\nA: AMD64 is the marketing name AMD chose for its implementation of x86-64 (Intel uses the name \"Intel 64\"). Both are equivalent and just different names for the same ISA.\n\nA: Yes, there was talk before (on the mailing list, I believe) that the name should be more generic and it was agreed that x86_64 was the right way to go (this is what Arch Linux uses I know).  At the time, they said that that change was going to be made but didn't know when (this was about a year ago I heard this).\n", "Q: How can I make the battery icon appear in my gnome-3 panel only when charging or discharging?

I read about one called rsync and another called Conduit.  \nIf possible I would also like a tool that would have GUI interface, and once I get more familiar with Linux a command line sync utility would also be good.\nMain goal is to backup everything local, nothing on line, but all backups that are local will be to external disks and syncing between computers.\nAnother feature would be able to see a preview of what is ready to be backed up / synced before it actually executes the operation.\nThanks...\n\nA: Deja-Dup (aka Backup in the latest versions of Ubuntu) can do your first round of backups very easily. They'll let you copy your data to another partition if that's what you want to do.\nTo backup your backups on other computers, I'd probably recommend something like rsync. It's command-line based but it'll make things easier in the long run :)\nrsync -avz -e ssh /local/backup/dir/ remoteuser@remotehost:/remote/backup/\n\nNotes about this method:\n\n\n*\n\n*You'll need openssh-server installed on each machine.\n\n*You'll want to set up SSH key authentication so you're not faffing around with passwords all the time. Perhaps make a \"backup\" user on each machine to keep things more secure and separate if you're dealing with more than one real person.\n\n*Schedule this using crontab -e\nAlternatively you can use a different filesystem for your backup location. There are emerging filesystems that act as a distributed filesystem to keep copies of the data on multiple nodes. This is more commonly used in SANs than backup scenarios, but it might be worth a look. One example is FineFS.\nAlso - useful reading:\nComparison of backup tools\n", "Q: Websites take a long time to load Websites in Ubuntu take a very long time to load. In Windows, it all works fine.

Want to format my hard drive altogether and either run Ubuntu solely or alongside freshly reinstalled Windows 7 (it's that time again - windows is all bugged down).\nGot a few questions though.\n1. I've read that on installation of Ubuntu we get an option of \n\"use entire disk\" - will this erase all the info on my hard drive (like formatting in DOS)?\n2. My Windows installation files are pre-loaded on my hard drive.

You can remove later, once you gain confidence.\nIf you use \"use entire disk\", it will format whole drive, then you will not be able to reinstall Windows from preserved installation on the hard disk. \n\nI'm currently using 64 bit Windows 7. Should i install 64 bit Ubuntu?\n\nDoesn't matter. You can use either of them.\n\nA: *\n\n*Yes, to the best of my knowledge (I almost never use these options), using the entire disk will, effectively, use the entire disk. This will entail re-partitioning the disk, so the data will probably be lost. Note however that the partitioner Ubuntu uses does not, in fact, wipe all the data off the drive (like Windows does, iirc) but just modifies the partition table.\n\n*I think Windows keeps those in a separate partition. In any case, using the entire disk will wipe that off and Windows will thus be forever lost (not that it'd be such a bad thing)! You will need to use a custom partition layout (there are many different possibilities, up to you) and keep that \"hidden\" Windows partition intact. Or you can re-install Windows first and install Ubuntu alongside if you feel safer that way.\n\n*As with Windows 64-bit, you have to be aware that some applications might not work, or be available, in 64-bit Linux. However, I find Linux generally has fewer problems of that kind (mostly because as software in open-source, it can easily be recompiled for 64-bit architectures), so I recommend 64-bit installs if your hardware supports it (here, it does).\n", "Q: Installed Ubuntu 11.10 alongside Windows 7 - getting grub> menu on boot So, I installed Ubuntu alongside Windows 7 just now, on my girlfriend's laptop. I used a USB stick and followed all the default options, choosing a partition size of 32GB for Ubuntu 11.10.\nAfter installation completed, the machine rebooted and now all I'm left with is a command prompt like this:\ngrub>\nI was expecting a boot menu rather than this, and I've idea how to proceed.

Sometimes applications in the Software Center are outdated and several years old. For instance the version of QtGain is several years old. \nWho should I contact to report this? \n\nA: You will actually want file a \"needs packaging\" bug and contact the package maintainer, not the developer of the software (although sometimes they are the same person).\nThe 'needs packaging' bug will need to be filed on launchpad against Ubuntu\nTo find the package maintainer, you can either search for the package on http://packages.ubuntu.com/ or from the command line with\napt-cache show <packagename>\n\nYou could then send the maintainer an email with the bug number.\n\nA: The developer of the software. For very old projects, they may not be interested in updating the application, in that case you could look for an alternative (or fix it yourself :)\nIn the case of QtGain, though, it seems to have been updated only a few months ago, and there is some sort of support thread on the QtGain page at QtApps.org. The developer is known as Vegeta, and the only way to contact him seems to be through the afore-mentioned thread.\nNote that the versions of applications in the Software Center (or the repo) are often not the very latest ones; in case of large gaps between the latest version and the in-repo version, you should contact the package's maintainer, or simply use the latest version and bypass the Software Center / package manager entirely (for that software).\n", "Q: Display problem on an Acer 7700GX i have just put ubuntu onto an old Acer 7700GX. it all looks lovely for a few minutes but then the desktop background goes blocky and the text goes a bit crazy. this doesn't seem to affect new windows that i open though. \nI guess its a driver thing. any tips?\n\nA: The OP resolved the issue by installing Xubuntu\n\ni installed Xubuntu and my machine is now way quicker.

I know that this has been asked quite a bit thus far, but I can't find any solutions in the previous posts!\nHaving installed Ubuntu server 11.10 and SSH, I think I've installed NX Server Free, as I just could not get FreeNX to work. The trouble is that I now get the following error messages when I try and connect with the client;\nXsession: unable to launch \"gnome-session\" X session --- \"gnome-session\" not \nfound; falling back to default session.\n\nXsession: unable to start X session --- no \"/home/james/.xsession\" file, no \n\"/home/james/.Xsession\" file, no session managers, no window managers, and no \nterminal emulators found; aborting.\n\nTrouble is, NX Server Free isn't really going to work in the long run for me as I need more than two connections at once, so I really need FreeNX. Any ideas?\n\nA: Thanks for the info, you did put me on the resolution of this incident.\nSo if you intend to run NX on a Linux distro which does not rely on standard gnome windows manager (gdm) such as Ubuntu from 11.X or such as myself a Mint Maya 13 (mdm for Mate desktop interface), you need to edit the NX node config file /usr/NX/etc/node.cfg and replace the type of default session launched when remotely login with Gnome type of session (which is specified at the client level when creating your connection script).\nThe problem I had came from the fact that by default, mdm is incompatible with gdm as they share objects. It is the same with Ubuntu session manager, I encountered the same problem before migrating to Mint. \nI tried to instal gnome-core as suggested above, but it did not proceed as gdm install crashed (because it shares objects with mdm, same problem with Ubuntu BTW). So I ended up putting the following line in /usr/NX/etc/node.cfg :\nCommandStartGnome = \"/etc/X11/Xsession mate-session\"\ninstead of the standard \nCommandStartGnome = \"/etc/X11/Xsession gnome-session\"\nAnd now I can login with NX on my Mint Maya with my mdm desktop. Perfect!!\nIt must be the same with Ubuntu distro Windows manager (I don't know its name)\nDon't foget that this is only valid if you select in your NX client a session type Unix / Gnome. You may also be able to select a Unix / Custom and put the startup line pointing toward the default session of your distro. I should give it a try.\nGood luck!!\n\nA: I ran into this issue. NX is launching the Xsession by itself, not with your user. Checkout the following file:\n /usr/NX/etc/node.cfg\n\nAt the bottom of this file you can change what it uses to initiate a Xsession.\n#\nSpecify path and name of the command to start the GNOME session.\n#\n\nCommandStartGnome = \"/etc/X11/Xsession gnome-session\"\n\n#\nSpecify path and name of the command to start the KDE session.\n#\n\nCommandStartKDE = \"/etc/X11/Xsession startkde\"\n\n\nA: From your question, and without further information, it looks as if you do not have a graphical environment installed at all. NX needs a complete graphical environment, both X.org and GNOME / KDE / another DM.\nVerify that you have a working GNOME installation. If your machine uses the Unity desktop, I suppose that some programs that NX will look for when starting a GNOME session will be missing (GDM, gnome-session, nautilus...). In that case, try to install gnome-core which should give you what you need.\n", "Q: 'WindowsBackend' object has no atribute 'iso_path' error when installing from CD I start installing ubuntu 11.10 from CD to have dual boot with windows 7 and 10 seconds before end i get message : An error occured :\n'WindowsBackend' object has no atribute 'iso_path'\n\nFor more information, please see the log file....\nI use HP laptop probook 4710s.\n\nA: I found a Question on Launchpad, that seems fitting to your problem.\nYou may have a look: https://answers.launchpad.net/wubi/+question/175550\n", "Q: Are textlive-xxx-doc packages required for installing LyX?

See my own answer below. \n\n\nA: I am currently running Ubuntu 11.10 on my IdeaPad V570. (Posting from it, actually) A dual boot with Windows 7 installed as my secondary OS.  The only issues I'm aware of at this time are that I cannot use my fingerprint reader This is not really an issue, since it has been proven time and time again that the use of fingerprint readers actually adds an unnecessary security hole.

I can still log in, but until I do, the backlight remains off and the fn(up) combination does nothing.  Once authenticated everything works as it should.\nI highly recommend this laptop as an Ubuntu Linux machine.  4.5 stars (-1/2 for backlight/resume issue)\nEdit:\nI can confirm that the memory card reader works in 11.10.

I plugged in to my wired connection to make sure my system has been updated to the latest fixes and the WiFi card has been champ ever since.\nFinal words of wisdom:\nIf something isn't working, run your update manager.  If there is a new version of the OS, Kernel, Software, whatever, download it, update, and reboot.  If your stuff still doesn't work after updating, post a bug report.\nI don't know how many times I've hammered at a problem for hours or even days to find that it's been fixed with a patch or update that had already been released.\nSave yourself the headache and update first.\nEDIT #4:\nOkay, not as final as I thought...

Wireless does not fix with updates, you need to open /etc/modprobe.d/blacklist.conf and add an entry to block the Acer Wireless module.\n\n*\n\n*Open a terminal and:\n\n        gksudo gedit /etc/modprobe.d/blacklist.conf\n\n\n*\n\n*Add this line to the bottom:\n\n        blacklist acer_wmi\n\n\n*\n\n*Step one, Save\n\n*Step two, Reboot\n\n*Step three...\n\n*Step four, World Domination\n\nNathanael out.\n\nA: It took some time to install Linux on this computer - definitely not for the faint of heart.\n\n\n*\n\n*grub does not install properly. I've reported this, see details at Bug #908203. The only way I managed to solve this was to install Linux Mint instead of Ubuntu; it got the grub on and now I can add any OS I want.\n\n*The wireless isn't working properly; this answer hit the spot and solved the problem.\n\n\nA: I'm running 64 bit 12.04 on a Lenovo V570 -- everything works out of the box, even the wireless, EXCEPT for the screen remaining off when resuming from suspend. Found the fix : adding \"acpi_backlight=vendor\" as a kernel boot parameter.\nHow to temporarily add a boot parameter : https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Grub2#Editing_the_GRUB_2_Menu_During_Boot\nHow to permanently add a boot parameter : https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Grub2#Configuring_GRUB_2\n\nA: It might be informative to mention that Ideapad Z580 models experience an ACPI issue and have 10-15 minute boot times currently. I sincerely hope you don't experience a similar issue with the new kernels on your V570!    I'm using 3.2.0-32 on my Ideapad with no issue but newer kernels have the issue for me.  \n\nA: Throughout my experience, Lenovo seems to be the most trustworthy linux laptop\nAlthough it is not on certified hardware list on Ubuntu, the hardware doesn't look problematic at all, as the main problems occur on graphic and ethernet/wireless cards.\nThe link you provided, says that this Lenovo has Intel HD Graphics 3000 card, which is pretty common and quite well supported.\nWith a little effort of google'ing, we can see that Ubuntu gives the acer-vmi(as usual) kernel module for wireless, though there's a fix here\nAlso, it looks like that SD card reader seems to be not working (although this might be fixed for 11.10), yet this thread explains how to fix this problem.\n\nA: FYI, GRUB2 (Ubuntu bootloader) seems to have difficulties with this laptop. Here is a Boot-Repair's log created with this PC showing that GRUB shows no error when installing but the MBR remains with no bootloader. The user reports that after Ubuntu installation, the PC continues to boot straight to Windows (this is normal because Ubuntu 11.10 didn't install GRUB correctly).\nhttp://paste.ubuntu.com/779724/\n\nA: Just installed onto my v570 from the CD and had no problems with Grub.  Must have been fixed but still had to blacklist the acer wifi as mentioned above to get wifi working.  I also have the problem with screen going dark after closing and opening the lid.\n", "Q: How to Change Quickly's Editor? I've just downloaded Ninja IDE and I really like it's interface.\nIs there a way to configure the Quickly app to launch my project in Ninja IDE when I type quickly edit?\n\nA: quickly should support the EDITOR environmental variable.\n$ quickly help ubuntu-application edit\nUsage: quickly edit\n\nA convenience command to open all of your python files in your project \ndirectory in your default editor, ready for editing.\n\nIf you put yourself EDITOR or SELECTED_EDITOR environment variable, this latter\nwill be used.

When I use ALT+TAB to cycle through my apps I would like to have icons for all my open browsers. I use the ` (Grave or the key above TAB) but I really find that hard to use.\nAnyway I can just use ALT+TAB only?\n\nA: Otuzbesli's answer works but for Ubunut 14.04 you need to install compiz-plugins in addition to compizconfig-settings-manager\nsudo apt-get install compizconfig-settings-manager compiz-plugins\n\n\nA: Here is my solution:\n\n\n*\n\n*Install compizconfig-settings-manager and open it (type ccsm in terminal).\n\n*Go to Desktop > Ubuntu Unity Plugin.\n\n*Open Switcher tab and make key to start the switcher and key to start the switcher in reverse disabled.\n\n*Go back to CompizConfig Settings Manager.\n\n*Go to Window Management and enable Application Switcher.\n\n*Open Application Switcher and change key bindings of \"Next Window (All windows)\" to Alt-Tab and \"Prev window (All windows)\" to Shift-Alt-Tab.\nThen you will start to use a different switcher instead of Unity's switcher.\n\nA: I'm running Ubuntu 18.04 running the Gnome shell. I installed Gnome Tweaks via\nsudo apt install gnome-tweak-tool\n\nand went to \n\nExtensions -> AlternateTab \n\nand switched the toggle to \"On\".\nThis changed the window-switcher to not group by application.\n\nA: The other option -which I'm testing out this week- is to have the ALT+TAB switch between apps, and ALT+| switch between windows of the same app. It sounds complicated but it works surprisingly well. \nUse case A: You're on Firefox and want to switch to Thunderbird: ALT+TAB.\nUse case B: You're on a Calc window and want to switch to another Calc window: ALT+|.\nIn B, you could use the old way of ALT+TAB, where it cycles through all your windows, but it can take a while to do that if you have more than a few windows open. With this thing, you always know where you want to go, and choose the quicker way to get there.\nI choose | because it's just above TAB, so my brain and my finger don't need to move very far.\nTo enable this: System Settings > Keyboard > Shortcuts > Navigation > Switch windows of an application (it's just underneath Switch applications, which is how I found it).\nEasy to test, safe, easy to revert, no need to install anything.\n\nA: Just thought I would share this since I tried to follow the accepted answer but couldn't find the Ubuntu Unity switcher.  I'm running 18.04 and I was able to change the alt-tab behavior by:\n\n\n*\n\n*going to settings->devices->keyboard\n\n*scroll down to the shortcut for \"Switch Windows\" (under the \"Navigation\" section)\n\n*change the shortcut for Switch Windows to alt-tab\n\n\nThis will overwrite the shortcut for \"Switch Applications\" which is the default behavior for alt-tab\n\nA: Before installing anything, try these key combinations:\n\n\n*\n\n*alt + | (the key above Tab, may be `, º, |...) to switch between instances of the current application\n\n*alt + ESC to direct switch to the next window\n\n*alt + Tab, of course, to switch between different applications\n\n\nYou can see the three keys are neighbors.\n\nA: I tried this and as soon as I launched ccsm:\n\n\n*\n\n*my desktop was gone. No start menu, taskbar, launcher.. Just the wallpaper.\n\n*Alt+Tab doesn't work at all.\n\n\nI was able to launch a Terminal using right click on desktop.

What is the best method for importing video from my JVC Everio HDD video camera into Ubuntu 11.10?\n\nA: Open a terminal and cd into the directory that contains the mount point for the camcorder. In my case this was /media/EVERIO_HDD\nThe video files are nested a little deeper in SD_VIDEO/PRG001\n(e.g. cd /media/EVERIO_HDD/SD_VIDEO/PRG001)\nThis folder contains two types of files ending in .mod and .moi. We only need the .mod files as these are the actual videos.\nTo copy them from the camcorder to your hard drive use something along the line of:\nmkdir /home/my_vids/downloaded_INSERT DATE HERE\ncp -p *.MOD /home/my_vids/downloaded_INSERT DATE HERE/\nThis can take a while as the files can be quite large. Note that the -p option tells the cp command to preserve the file timetamps, which will have been set by the camcorder when the recording was made.\nIf you prefer the files to have a suffix of .mpg instead of .MOD. Run the following rename command from within your downloaded folder to convert them.\ncd /home/my_vids/downloaded_2009-03-01\nrename 's/.MOD$/.mpg/' *.MOD\nAnd that's about it. You will still need to delete them from the camcorder (best done from the camcorder menu). Also remember to keep backups...\nReference link here\n\nA: You should be able to use nautilus to copy it over directly. Navigate to the video file on your camera, hit F3 for another pane in nautilus, navigate to where you want it, drag and drop the video. You can also check in the software center for editing apps.  Some may have an import function.  Openshot and Pitivi are the only two I can think of.\n", "Q: What are the disadvantages of adding the repositories from 11.04 to 11.10? The reason I'm doing this is to have Sun's java 6 installed (getting updates, etc.)\n\n\n*\n\n*In 11.10 Sun's Java was removed from the partner repository.\n\n\nWhat do you think are the potential disadvantages?\n\nA: No disadvantages are guaranteed, but you could easily end up with dependency issues, where one package depends on a different version of a library than another package, so it could mess up your system updates or trying to install certain applications. Regarding Java, as mentionned already, try to follow alternative instructions from blogs to download individual packages from an older version of Ubuntu rather than adding old repositories.\n\nA: If you use the natty repos you could potentially damage your system, however here are some instructions found at: How do I install Oracle Java JDK 7?\n", "Q: How can I prevent Zeitgeist from reading clipboard?

I want to run a Windows application in Ubuntu using Wine. However, from past experience I know that this can be a frustrating, difficult process because of Wine and hardware bugs. What is the best, canonical way to troubleshoot problems I encounter trying to install and run a given application?\n\nA: I recommend checking out the Wine HQ AppsDB.\nThey categorize apps by compatibility. Reviews include Wine version and Linux distro (and version) the app was tested on, so you may have more success than indicated in old reviews.\nIn my experience, Wine has been pretty good for my windows apps needs. Generally, it's not very good at running commercial equivalents to the big stock apps in Ubuntu (it's always tricky to install Internet Explorer, MS Office, Adobe Photoshop, at least their latest versions, in Wine). Some apps run flawlessly, whereas a lot of apps need just a hint of tweaking (missing DLL or font file, some apps try to run from CD). Compatibility for most apps improves with every new version of Wine. Best check out the apps DB, you could ask here again or take it to the forums.

So \nxdg-mime default org.kde.dolphin.desktop inode/directory\n\ndid the trick. \nKeep in mind to have a look where the desktop link is located.

I recently gave ~200 photos numerical titles in Shotwell which describe their sequences--001, 002, etc. But I'd like for this sequence to be the same in the filenames, too, so that when I open the folder in Nautilus the photos are listed in order. I think Shotwell saved the title in the exif data somewhere. In fact, I finally found it using the Gnome image viewer, under XMP Other and photoshop:Headline. What I'd like is a way to read these Shotwell titles and have those used as the filenames. I could probably do this with Python if I knew how to access that metadata. \n\nA: As there is no other answer showing how to actually rename photos with the titles added in Shotwell, here is a quick way to script it using bash, as you say in the comments that you already have a python alternative. There may well be other ways of doing it, but this one might be useful for someone.\nAs you have already given your pictures a title in Shotwell and exported them, and found out where the metadata is stored that Shotwell adds, it is relatively straightforward to put a script together.\nPlease install libimage-exiftool-perl, as that will be necessary for the script.\n\n*\n\n*If you use exiftool -a G1 -s pic.jpg, you can see all the metadata types and tags embedded within a picture, and also where Shotwell places the metadata:\n\n[XMP-photoshop] Headline                        : 002\n[XMP-dc]        Title                           : 002\n[IPTC]          Caption-Abstract                : 002\n[IPTC]          Headline                        : 002\n[IPTC]          OriginatingProgram              : Shotwell\n[IPTC]          ProgramVersion                  : 0.13.1+trunk\n\n\n\n*Now either the XMP-photoshop or the IPTC tags can be used with exiftool in our script to show the metadata (and then use that resulting value to rename the file).\n\nEntering exiftool -IPTC:headline pic.jpg results in\nHeadline                        : 002\n\nand this can be parsed with awk and fed back as the variable to rename the file:\nmv -i \"$i\" \"$(exiftool -IPTC:headline -s3 \"$i\").jpg\"\n\n\n\n*The final script would be like this:\n\n#!/bin/bash\n\nfor i in *.jpg; do\n  mv -i \"$i\" \"$(exiftool -IPTC:headline -s3 \"$i\").jpg\"\ndone\n\nSo, now all your files have been renamed with their Shotwell titles, as we see when we examine one with exiftool -a -G1 -s pic.jpg:\nExifTool Version Number         : 9.12\nFile Name                       : 002.jpg\n\nNotes:\n\n*\n\n*The repository version of exiftool is fine, but is quite old, so if you need support for various new features and bugfixes, see the official site for how to build and install the more recent version.\n\n\n*All of the metadata is preserved unchanged by the script, as only the actual file itself is being renamed.\n\n\n*The script will obviously only work if your pictures have titles created with Shotwell embedded within them, but it could be adapted for other purposes.\nFor more general information, see man exiftool or the Ubuntu manpages online.\n\nA: I did a apt-cache search exif, and found (among other packages):  \nexiv2 - EXIF/IPTC metadata manipulation tool  \nbins - Generate static HTML photo albums using XML and EXIF tags  \nexif - command-line utility to show EXIF information in JPEG files  \nexifprobe - Read metadata from digital pictures  \nexiftags - utility to read Exif tags from a digital camera JPEG file  \njigl - Generates a static html photo gallery from one or more directories of images  \nlibexif-ruby1.9.1 - EXIF tag parsing Library for ruby1.9.1  \nlibimage-exif-perl - Perl module to extract EXIF information from image files  \nlibimage-exiftool-perl - Library and program to read and write meta information in multimedia files  \nlibimage-info-perl - allows extraction of meta information from image files  \nmetacam - extract EXIF information from digital camera files  \npyrenamer - mass file renamer written in PyGTK  \npython-exif - Python library to extract EXIF data from tiff and jpeg files  \nrenrot - Rename and rotate files according to EXIF tags  \n\nSo try pyrenamer.

This question has been asked many times for Ubuntu 11.10 but it always has been closed and linked with this link, but that accepted answer is from 2010 and that setting doesn't work anymore for Ubuntu 11.10. Furthermore, the brightness setting doesn't exist anymore in \"Energy\" options. It is now on \"Screen\" options and it doesn't seem to remember the setting after reboot.\nSo, how to make Unity remember brightness settings?\n\nA: The short answer is: you can't. Gnome power manager doesn't save the brightness setting. \nThe best you can do is to automatically set it to a reasonable default at startup.    \nFor 11.10, the only solution I have found that works is the one given here:\nhttp://blog.ishans.info/2011/09/25/set-brightness-automatically-at-the-startup-in-linux/\nSave http://ishans.info/attachments/article/65/setBrightness.py locally, change the brightness percentage in the last line to your preferred value, and add a new startup application to run: \npython /wherever-you-saved-the-script/setBrightness.py\n\nA: I haven't found a way to get Ubuntu (I'm currently using 13.04) to save the last used brightness settings, but the default brightness of 100% on my laptop was too bright,  and forced me to find a workaround (using the link denrossalenga provided).\nJust add a line like this to your /etc/rc.local file:\necho 60 > /sys/class/backlight/acpi_video0/brightness\n\nThis will give you a startup brightness of 60%. Change as appropriate.\n\nA: I know it's been a long time. But I still gonna answer it as it appears in Google search. \nIf you dont have xbacklight installed than install it\nsudo apt-get install xbacklight\n\nNow what is left to do is to do the remembering the brightness and applying on log in.\nsudo sed -i '$ixbacklight | cat > ~/.brightness' /etc/gdm/PostSession/Default\ntouch ~/.gnomerc\necho 'b=$(cat ~/.brightness)' >> ~/.gnomerc\necho 'xbacklight -set $b' >> ~/.gnomerc\n\nThis will remember the brightness form the time of shutdown and set it back as soon as you log in to your user.\n\nA: You may try this one!

I'm an old hand at software development, but not so experienced with packaging.  I've built one dpkg before, but it wasn't a source package.\nI'm working on getting an application submitted to the Ubuntu app store.  The documentation on packaging is a bit on the vague side, saying not much more than that it needs to be packaged in the \"Debian source package format\":\nhttp://developer.ubuntu.com/publish/my-apps-packages/\nI'm sure I could muddle through putting a Debian source package tarball together, but there are a few things I wonder about:\n\n\n*\n\n*How is the 32-vs-64 bit thing handled?  Do they take source and build apps from both?\n\n*How is supporting different versions of Ubuntu handled -- 10.04, 10.10, 11.04, 11.10, etc?\n\n*How are dependencies handled.  If, for instance, my app depends on SDL, how do I specify that?\n\n*If I don't want to distribute source code for my application (which is a proprietary license), is there a clean way to indicate that source shouldn't go with the app?\n\n*If I'm not using autoconf/automake, does my Makefile need to be set up in a particular way, or are the autotools required?\n\n\nI imagine that the Ubuntu folks probably take the source and build it for each of the different platforms and architectures that they support buying apps for, but since there's no apparent way in the submit process to indicate what the app runs with (i.e. requires GTK3 and 64-bit support, or Intel-only with no ARM support), I can only hope that stuff can be specified in the source format.\nIs there any good, thorough documentation specifically on source package creation you can point me to?\n\nA: On the page you link to it says:\n\nCanonical provides this packaging service to you free of charge.\n\nand goes on to explain how to lay out the tarball containing your binaries.\nIf you create such a tarball and submit it via MyApps then all the packaging will be done for you. As it says at the bottom you can provide a source package if you like, but it's not required. Note that this is specific to closed-source or for-pay apps, anything that is libre and gratis has a different process currently.\nAs for your other questions:\n\nHow is the 32-vs-64 bit thing handled?\n\nYou can just upload 32-bit if you like as that works on 64-bit too.

If, for instance, my app depends on SDL, how do I specify that?\n\nThat will be added as part of the packaging process. If you want to add a comment specifying the dependencies then it will likely speed things up.\n\nIf I don't want to distribute source code for my application (which is a proprietary license), is there a clean way to indicate that source shouldn't go with the app?\n\nAs stated you don't have to provide the source at all.\n\nIf I'm not using autoconf/automake, does my Makefile need to be set up in a particular way, or are the autotools required?\n\nAny build system supported in Ubuntu is allowed.

My file system recently experienced multiple failures.  An fsck from an old live cd I had laying around (Hardy) was able to repair things enough that I could boot my system (xubuntu 9.10 I think) but there's now lots of missing files causing random things to fail.\nI attempted to reinstall some of the packages that are missing files but turns out debconf is one of those!  In particular it seems to be missing several perl files in the /usr/share/perl5/Debconf/ path.

What exactly does the $ sign and the parenthesis mean?\nAlso, what is going on a technical level that causes the output of these two commands to be the same?\n\nA: This is command substitution for bash. \n\nCommand substitution allows the output of a command to replace the\n  command itself. Command substitution occurs when a command is enclosed\n  as follows:\n $(command) or\n\n `command`\n\n\nhttp://www.gnu.org/software/bash/manual/bashref.html#Command-Substitution\nMore:\nhttp://tldp.org/LDP/abs/html/commandsub.html\nhttp://wiki.bash-hackers.org/syntax/expansion/cmdsubst\nAnd a good example similar to your question:\nhttp://bashshell.net/shell-scripts/using-command-substitution-in-a-bash-shell-script/\n\nA: When the shell encounters text enclosed in $( ), it:\n\n\n*\n\n*Takes it to be a command and (as Panther says) runs the command in a subshell.\n\n*Substitutes the output of the command, in place of the entire $(...) expression. Any trailing newlines are removed from this output.\n\n*Performs further expansions if $(...) was not quoted (see below).\n\n\nAs heartsmagic's answer explains, this is one of two available syntaxes for command substitution.\n\"What ... causes the output of these two commands to be the same?\"\nIt's actually somewhat uncommon for the output of ls to be exactly the same as the output of echo $(ls):\nek@Io:~/tmp$ ls\nbar  foo\nek@Io:~/tmp$ echo $(ls)\nbar foo\n\nls typically separates filenames by two or more spaces, or a newline. This helps us tell them apart more easily, especially since spaces in filenames are somewhat common (but multiple consecutive spaces, less common).\nWord Splitting\nWhen I ran echo $(ls), the following happened.\n\n\n*\n\n*Command substitution replaced $(ls) with:\nbar\nfoo\n\nYou might be surprised to hear that, since that's probably not what you see when you run ls by itself! This disparity in what ls outputs is explained below, but is actually not the reason you end up with a single space between those two words. The same thing would happen if $(ls) were substituted with bar  foo (with two spaces).\n\n*Afterwards, the shell performed word splitting, treating bar and foo as separate arguments to the echo command instead of as a single argument containing spaces.\nGlobbing (a.k.a. filename/pathname expansion) would also be performed, if the command's output had contained *, ?, or [.\nAs detailed below, quoting with double quotes permits command substitution but suppresses word splitting and globbing.\nWhen echo receives multiple arguments (except for options like -n, which are treated specially and not printed at all), it prints them all out, with a single space between subsequent arguments. echo then prints a newline, unless the -n option was passed.\nThus echo $(ls) shows output like bar foo instead of bar  foo.\nIf you run ls and it lists no files, or just one file, the output of ls will often be the same as the output of echo $(ls). Even then, it will not always be the same, such as when a filename contains whitespace other than isolated (single) spaces:\nek@Io:~/tmp2$ touch 'my   file'\nek@Io:~/tmp2$ ls\nmy   file\nek@Io:~/tmp2$ echo $(ls)\nmy file\n\nWhen ls prints multiple files, its output is not likely to be exactly that same as the output of $(ls). Similarly:\n\n\n*\n\n*echo a b and echo $(echo a b) produce the same output, but\n\n*echo 'a   b' and echo $(echo 'a   b') do not.\n\n\nThis is an important thing to know about command substitution--unquoted command substitutions are subject to word splitting (and globbing).\nQuoting\nIf you want to prevent word splitting and globbing--and you usually will want to prevent them--you can enclose your expression for command substitution in double quotes (\" \"). The reason to use double quotes rather than single quotes is that single quotes are even stronger; they would suppress command substitution.\nThis also applies to parameter expansion, which is a more commonly used shell expansion than command substitution, and to arithmetic expansion. The reasons it is important to quote command substitutions (except in the fairly uncommon) case that you know you want further expansions to occur) are the same as the reasons to quote parameter expansion.\nTerminal Detection\nDouble-quoting often sufficient to avoid unexpected results from command substitution. In particular, it will work with the echo-based examples above as well as the example of ls on a directory with a single entry containing spaces:\nek@Io:~/tmp2$ echo \"$(ls)\"\nmy   file\n\nHowever, as noted above, you might be surprised to find that what you see when you run ls is often not what gets passed to echo in place of \"$(ls)\":\nek@Io:~/tmp$ ls\nbar  foo\nek@Io:~/tmp$ echo \"$(ls)\"\nbar\nfoo\n\nThis is because ls checks if standard output is a terminal to decide how to format its output, when output formatting is not explicitly specified.\n\n\n*\n\n*When stdout is a terminal, ls outputs in vertically sorted columns, like ls -C.\n\n*When stdout is not a terminal, ls lists each entry on its own line, like ls -1.\n\n\nIn command substitution, standard output isn't a terminal because the command's output is not being sent directly to a terminal for you to see--instead, it is being captured by the shell and used as part of another command.\nTo get multi-column formatting when running ls via command substitution, pass it the -C flag:\nek@Io:~/tmp$ echo \"$(ls -C)\"\nbar  foo\n\n(dir is sometimes suggested as an alternative to ls -C and will also work for this, though dir behaves like ls -C -b rather than merely ls -C.)\nShell Aliasing\nAnother reason ls may sometimes behave differently from echo \"$(ls)\" is that ls may be a shell alias. Run alias ls to check; on Ubuntu you usually get alias ls='ls --color=auto'. This makes it so that, when ls appears as the first word of a command you run interactively (and also in the far less common situation that alias expansion has been enabled in a non-interactive shell), it is replaced with ls --color=auto.\nFor example, when I run ls, it lists directories colored blue and executables colored green (and observes many other coloring rules, too). --color=auto causes ls to print colored output when standard output is a terminal, and not otherwise.\nTo get colored output when running ls via command substitution, pass it the --color or --color=always option. If you like, you can combine this with -C:\necho $(ls -C --color)\n\nNote that while you can make ls an alias to ls --color or ls --color=always instead of ls --color=auto, and ls --color=always doesn't care if standard output is a terminal... that alias will still not cause ls to produce colored output when invoked by command substitution. This is because shell aliases (in Bourne-style shells like bash) are only expanded when the shell sees them as the first word of a command, and they are not inherited by subshells.\n\nA: () and $() are used to run commands in a subshell.\nSee http://tldp.org/LDP/abs/html/subshells.html for details.\n\nA: Using $ in front of a variable name invokes the value assigned to the variable. Echo without the $ will just print the name of the variable to the screen (or standard out).\n", "Q: PulseAudio: Can not create sink with specific name anymore Since having upgraded to Oneiric I can not create a sink in PulseAudio with a specific name.

I'm not sure what to do from there.\n\nA: It is confusing at first.\nWhen you download the .iso with firefox, you would save the file rather then opening it.\nIf you do not have any CD burning software installed, windows does not know what to do with an .iso, it thinks it is an archive (zip) file.\nYou do NOT extract or unzip the iso.\nYou have several options at this point\n\n\n*\n\n*Install ubuntu with the wubi installer\n\n\nfollow the instructions on this page :\nhttps://wiki.ubuntu.com/WubiGuide\n\n\n*\n\n*You can also use unetbootin to \"install\" the ubuntu iso to a flash drive. You would then re boot your computer and during the boot process boot from the flash drive.\n\n*Burn the ubuntu .iso to a CD\nhttps://help.ubuntu.com/community/BurningIsoHowto\nYou can then either re-boot or run the wubi installer\nhttp://www.howtogeek.com/howto/9142/easily-install-ubuntu-linux-with-windows-using-the-wubi-installer/\n==== STOP ====\n\n\n*\n\n*You sound very new to Ubuntu and before you do much else I highly suggest you back up any data you do not want to loose.

So I chose Ubuntu and began setting up my hardware. I was installing a Lexmark printer driver when suddenly it requested the root password.  I entered \"root\" as that is what the root password in Linux has always been. Im going back 20 years.  \nAnyway I've got this installation prompt for password sitting on the back burner while I search the net for the default root password. I can't seem to find it anywhere.  I stead I find somebody stating that Ubuntu doesn't release the password so we can't muss things up.  Is this true?  \nPlease tell me it isn't so. In my mind that goes away from everything that Linux is, or was.\n\nA: Enter your own password to temporarily gain root (superuser) privileges. Also usually you do not re-login as root but stay as \"yourself\" but gain root privileges temporarily. \nIf working in a shell/terminal entering sudo (super user do) before your command in the shell tells the system you wish to temporarily invoke superuser rights.\n\nA: Ubuntu doesn't set a root password at install time - instead you use sudo to gain root privileges. Chances are you just need to enter your own password at this prompt, or perhaps it's not written with sudo in mind?\nYou can set a root password if you need to, with:\nsudo passwd\n\nWhich will first ask you to enter your password to become root, then ask you for a new root password (and again to verify it).\n", "Q: wubi installed ubuntu 11.10 wont boot after reboot (which wubi prompted me to do) i choose ubuntu and a few lines of code and i press escape and choose normal mode ,the screen fills with code i then get a blinking cursor for about 30 seconds the cursor goes away and the screen is blank (the same thing happens when i choose other modes) i normally run windows xp\np.s. this is my first time trying to use ubuntu so i guess im a noob\n\nA: Sounds as if you are having a problem with your graphics card.

Then you repartition your hard disk drive using gparted from within the live CD and re-install or remove it.\nTo prepare a live CD, just download the Ubuntu version you want to install from www.ubuntu.com and then burn it by double-clicking the ISO. If you do not have a cd burner, prepare a USB stick.\nTo do this, you want to use the Ubuntu \"Startup Disk Creator\", it can be found in synaptic but should be pre-installed on Ubuntu.\nThen simply boot from your device. When restarting your machine, you might need to press the key needed to get you into the selection menu where you can choose what device you want to boot from. On my Dell XPS it's F12, but it should show on startup what key you need to press to load from the boot media.\n\nA: Note that since you are using a Mac, you cannot stably boot from a USB stick. I know this from research and past experiences. Therefore, definitely use the live CD to boot your computer. To boot from the CD, hold down the alt/option button as you turn the computer on. If the live CD is not already inserted, then do so when the list of boot options appear. Then select to boot from the CD. On my Mac, three images appear at the boot screen: an image of a hard disk, and two images of a CD. The image of the hard disk and one of the images of the CD has \"Windows\" written below it. The other image of the CD has EFI written below. Select to boot from the CD labeled \"Windows.\"\nOnce you have booted your computer with the live CD, use either the disk utility program to erase any Linux partitions on your machine (except for the swap partition). I typically use disk utility; however, I have been told that GParted is another excellent option for removing partitions from the disk. I only use GParted for manually resizing disk partitions.\nPlease remember to backup any data before using either program to erase the disk.\nHope this helps.\nEdit:\nAssuming you are using a Mac, then I presume that the \"repair\" CD is the Mac OS install DVD. In that case, you will simply boot from that CD just as you would with the Linux live CD. If your computer does not boot from the CD, then there may be something wrong with either the CD/DVD drive or the boot-loader, which is out of my realm of knowledge.\n", "Q: Problem with External Hard Disk I'm experiecning a problem with my External Hard Disk. \nWhen I plug my HDD in ubuntu it works. When I plug it in Windows, it also works. But when I transfer files from Ubuntu to HDD and then trying to acess them from Windows, no matter how I try, I get error messages. And when I'm able to acess them I cannot cpoy, or delete them through windows. They can only be modified through Ubuntu. I gave my HDD to a friend and she couldn't copy a folder I had created using Ubuntu. When I checked it using Windows 7, I clicked on the foldres' properties, and I saw that the \"Read-Only\" box was checked. I unckecked the box, but nothing. Only Ubuntu could modify the files in the folder, and copy or delete them from the HDD. How can I prevent ubuntu from making my files \"read-only\" for windows? \n\nA: I'm pretty sure that NTFS WRITE support is experimental for the Linux fs driver. The filesystem is probably broken. You could try running a fdisk from Windows on that volume and pray that it will repair it. Aside from that, you really shouldn't be using NTFS to share data between Windows and Linux, VFAT e.g. Fat32, is more than adequate.\n", "Q: Screensaver Settings Hello, world.\nI recently installed ubuntu 11.10.

Ubuntu constantly offers me number of updates. But it takes lots of my time to review such offers to find relevant updates (for example, if I am not interested in kernel updates). \nSecond, it almost always causes new problems. I like new features, but I also like my settings and I really hate Ubuntu if after update it starts into a text-mode shell, with sluggish responsiveness, doesn't mount my nfs folders, etc. And there is no easy way to revert changes! Maybe I don't understand something? Please, help me if you know:\n\n\n*\n\n*Is it possible to see only offers to update only those packages, which I specify in a list? For example, if I am not interested in any other update, but only in firefox? \n\n*Is there a way to see what problems will it make before I start any update? \n\n*Is there a way to revert changes automatically if I don't like the state after an update was done?\n\n\nA: Generally speaking, updates should provide improvements. I don't think it's recommended to put security updates on hold, for instance. And security updates should rarely cause any problems to the system. If updates of normal packages are causing you problems, I would guess that your system is instable in some way.\nHowever, you can chose what type of updates you want to receive. Start Update Manager, hit the Settings button down in the left corner. This should take you to the Updates tab in Software Sources. Untick the checkboxes for the kind of updates you do not want Update Manager to present to you. It's highly recommended to keep security updates though.\n\nA: You do not get new versions of packages or the kernel in Ubuntu as normal updates. They do, however, provide security fixes, and that is very important since the kernel is responsible for everything, including everything that has to do with networking. The kernel is the most important package to always keep updated. Otherwise, you might suddenly find that computer is being used by other people. :)\nSome packages are exceptions, like Firefox which is only supported for a short time by Mozilla. For security reasons, new versions of Firefox is provided. Ubuntu 10.04, still uses Firefox 3.6.24 for instance, since that is still supported by Mozilla. So, package updates normally do not mean new features, but are only provided to fix small problems or to close security holes. They are called Stable Release Updates, and you can sometimes see people refer to them as SRUs. You can read more about that here: https://wiki.ubuntu.com/StableReleaseUpdates\nNo such updates are intended to break your system, so it is not possible to get a list of problems in advance. However, if you use AMDs proprietary drivers for VGA, then that is known to cause problems with kernel upgrades. The solution, then, is to uninstall the proprietary drivers before you reboot after a kernel upgrade, and then reinstall them. It's really ugly. Luckily, the open drivers have no such issues at all and just work out of the box -- when it works. :) They don't work well for all cards, but Radeon HD5 and 6-series should work well. \n", "Q: Adding options (right-click) to icons on Gnome-Shell dock Unity introduce a new costumization to the icons that consist on a little piece of code for the .desktop of the file, and then, when righ clicking on the icon on the Unity Dock, the options you define appears...\nI wish to know if that could be done with the Gnome-Shell dock icons so I could have only the white Libreoffice Icon and then set the options to execute Writer Impress etc... \nThanks in Advance\n\nA: Unfortunately, you'll have to wait at least for gnome 3.4 to get that feature in gnome-shell.\nIt's right now being worked on, see the live.gnome.org webpage for further reference.\nIn the meantime, you can install the jump-list-gnome-shell-extension.\nYou can get it from here\nThis, however, will only show your recently and most used files, it won't enable you to launch writer or impress like Unity does.\n", "Q: Installer don't detect any partition on drive \nPossible Duplicate:\nCan't use a particular partition for Ubuntu installation \n\nI want to install Ubuntu 11.10 x64 on my system (MSI P67A-C43 B.3) and a Western Digital 1,5TB SATA2 (connected to SATA2 controller), but the installer don't detect any partition on this drive. Really there is an NTFS partition that uses whole disk, and there are 400GB of data on this partition. Even if I have reduced the size of this partition of about 100GB, the installer did not detect any partition and reports that drive is empty. I've also tested 11.10 x32 edition, also LinuxMint 12 have the same problem. Also I've tried to use gparted whithout success.\nThis drive was partitioned and formatted within Windows 7.\nThere are other Hard drives, but I've disconnected all except this before booting from USB Flash Disk (made by tool that offer pendrivelinux).\nHow can i install Ubuntu on this hard drive?\nThanks to all and excuse me for my english.\n\nA: I was having this same issue and had to use the alternative .iso image and install that way. Once I did this though I had graphics issues. I would try this though.\n", "Q: Uninstall Ubuntu 11.10 / Install Linux Mint 12 I'd like to switch my system to Linux Mint. For that purpose I made a live USB drive to boot from. However when booting I'm not asked from what to boot. Ubuntu is just being loaded, and then it doesn't work properly. Do I have to uninstall Ubuntu first? If so, how?\n\nA: The BIOS\nThe BIOS (Basic In and Output System) software is built into the PC, and is the first code run by a PC when powered on. Its job is to check for hardware and load operating systems it may find.\nFor more information you can check out the Booting article on Wikipedia.\n\nEditing the boot-order\nWhen your computer starts up, it checks all drives for operating systems in a particular order as set in the BIOS's configuration. The BIOS loads the first OS it finds. To make your BIOS check for operating systems on a CD or USB first, instead of your hard drive, you have to edit the boot-order. How you do so will differ from machine to machine.\nWhen you turn on your computer, you will generally get some sort of a splash screen where generally two options appear: setup and boot-menu. These options are bound to a certain key on your keyboard. Generally one of the F-keys, the Escape key or the Delete key.\nYou need to hit the key associated with the \"setup\" option, or something similar when the splash screen is displayed. Then shift the values in such a way that USB is on top, anything else is optional. Once you hit save and the machine restarts, it should boot off the USB, provided it is inserted.\n\nRemoving operating systems\nOperating systems are installed to partitions, sections of your hard disks. When an OS is installed, the installer will generally create or ask you to create the partitions to which the OS will be installed on.\nThe simplest way of removing an OS is to remove the partitions it is installed on. This will generally not remove any data stored on the disk, a quick format merely removes pointers to data on the disk, so that the data appears to be deleted and can be overwritten by another OS.\nBefore you remove a partition, remember to backup any important data you might have on there, because it is not easily recovered once you hit \"format\".\nThis process is handles by the Linux Mint installer, which means you won't have to worry about it.\n\n\nA: You should go into your BIOS by turning the computer on and pressing either the F2, F11, F3 ,F12 or ESC key while your manufacturer's logo shows up. Then look for something like \"boot order\" or just \"boot\" and put the flash drive before the hard drive and then reboot.\nRegarding uninstalling Ubuntu, you don't uninstall operating systems, you format the drive and install a new one.\n\nA: Your problem isn't in fact that hard to solve, Lisa. \nYou say you have made a \"Live USB Drive\", I take it that you used the utility in ubuntu to make a bootable USB from a Linux Mint image, which is the right thing to to. \nNext is booting from it. Insert the drive in a USB port, and reboot your computer. Usually the first image shown will be \"ASUS\", \"DELL\", \"HP\" or whatever brand your motherboard (or computer) is. From here you will have to enter the BIOS, to make the computer boot from the USB drive instead of your harddrive. Since I only own Asus products, I can't give you a complete list of keys vs brands, but I have to press [DEL] to enter BIOS. Other commonly used keys include [F2], [F8], [F10], [F11]. But as said, different brands use different keys. \nNow to the tricky part. BIOS's look different, but you will be looking for a section named Boot. In there, you should be able to select your USB drive (either it's listed under your optical drive, harddrive etc., or you might have to select harddrive, and choose from a list, which drive to use.)\nCheck it out, usually it's pretty straight forward. Just remember to insert the USB drive before booting the computer and entering BIOS.\n", "Q: Copying code directly into the console with keyboard shortcuts \nPossible Duplicate:\nMaking Ctrl+C copy text in gnome-terminal? \n\nI am have installed Ubuntu 10.04 right now, and I am getting quite a bit of code examples from my browser, Firefox, where the usual ctrl-c short cut works but it doesn't seem to work for pasting the code directly, ctrl-v, into the shell console.\nThis isn't a critical issue,pasting with the mouse still works,but any suggestions as to how to activate ctrl-v or what the correct native short-cut for the console is would be great.\n\nA: In gnome-terminal you have to user Shift-Ctrl-V to paste and Shift-Ctrl-C to copy.\n", "Q: rsync not actually copying files I'm trying to synchronize a large directory of files from my server to a local box.

Please bear with me as I'm a newcomer to Linux.\nI've been writing GUI programs in REALbasic on a Mac for several years.  I'm trying to learn Python and I want to write GUI apps for Linux (primarily Ubuntu and Mint since they are the distros I have access to and they seem to be the most popular).\nI basically have three questions:\n\n\n*\n\n*Are there any significant differences between GTK and QT\n\n*I've toyed with quickly and Glade on Ubuntu but I understand that they are based on GTK 2 and this is now obsolete.  Is that correct?\n\n*Are there any all-in-one editors that let me design a GUI and then add Python code to it? (for instance, add a button to a window in the editor, double click the button and then add the Python code that is to execute when the button is pressed)\n\n\nSorry if these are really dumb questions but I want to start learning the 'right' tools from the start.\n\nA: GTK and Qt are open-source cross-platform User Interface toolkits and development frameworks. These are the two most popular frameworks in use for Linux because they are open-source and give developers a powerful toolkit to design Graphical User Interfaces. GTK is used as the standard toolkit for the GNOME, LXDE and Xfce Desktop Environments while Qt is used for KDE. \nIf you code in C, then obviously go for GTK+\nIf you code in C++, go for Qt, otherwise you will ned Gtkmm (a C++ wrapper over GTK+)\nIf you code in Python, both GTK+ and Qt have bindings for the language: see PyGtk, PyQt and PySide (the one launched by Nokia themselves).\n\nA: I'll try to answer your questions, without going in crazy directions.\n\n\n*\n\n*They are significantly different, even though they are both widget libs.  Regular GTK+ is based on C, and QT on C++.  Although bindings exist for almost every programming languages.\n\n*You are fairly correct about GTK2, although there are so many GTK2 applications.  I expect GTK2 to be in use for a while, just as GTK1 was.  When push comes to shove, GTK2 is deprecated, and if you are starting fresh go GTK3.\n\n*Remeber GTK, and QT, are just widget toolkits.  For example...  Gnome applications, use GTK and also the Gnome-Libs.  If you want that, take a look at vala.  It is considered simple, the vala compiles source-to-source directly to C, and has full  bindings for many programming languages.  You might also want to look at Anjuta, just make sure you have the new gtk3 versions.  Apparently strait PyGTK only supports GTK2, current last I checked.  If you are looking to avoid all Linux DE libs, I would suggest looking at QT.  Plain QT is different from KDE applications, which include KDE libs. QT is considered very cross-platform, which is cool if you want to compile for non *nix.  If you want to get started with QT + Python, look at PySide (LGPL) or PyQT (GPL).  QT has some good GUI builders like qt creator, and qt-designer.\n\nA: Qt is mainly used in KDE, and GTK+ in GNOME. So if you want to develop for GNOME, consider GTK+ since the necessary dependencies for GTK+ libraries should already be installed on a GNOME system; the end user will not need to install them. GTK+ development is also benefited by a tool called Glade Interface Designer; if you wish, you can use that to create your user interfaces.\n", "Q: How to convert a btrfs file system in raid1 mode to raid0? I've install Ubuntu 11.10 with btrfs as the / file system (was a bit of a mess to do, I'll explain if people are interested) so I can expand the primary file system into the second drive on the system(*).\nAfter installing the system, I ran btrfs device add /dev/sdb1 / and it added the new device and expanded the file system on to it, and all was good. But according to the (wrong) manual I was reading, I also had to run btrfs filesystem balance and this apparently converted my filesystem to \"raid1\" mode so everything is stored redundantly twice - once on each drive, and I can only use 50% of my total capacity:\n$ btrfs filesystem df /\nData, RAID0: total=78.00GB, used=41.57GB\nSystem, RAID1: total=8.00MB, used=16.00KB\nSystem: total=4.00MB, used=0.00\nMetadata, RAID1: total=3.75GB, used=355.06MB\n\nIts a nice feature, but I was kind of wanting to use \"raid0\" (stripping). I've tried to remove the new device so I can re-add it, but when I try that I get an error and syslog has this:\nbtrfs: unable to go below two devices on raid1\n\nSo my question is: how can I convert my filesystem back to raid0 so I can use the total space of both disks?\n(*) Like can be done with LVM, but with btrfs you can host multiple \"partitions\" on the same \"file system\" and space is allocated dynamically where you need it - unlike in LVM.\n\nA: You read the right manual; you do need to run balance after adding the drive in order to restripe your data across the new disk.  It also happens to convert any DUP chunks to RAID1, and the default mkfs options use RAID1 or DUP for metadata depending on whether you have multiple disks or not.  There is not currently a supported way to convert back, but there are some restriper patches floating around on the btrfs mailing list that eventually will allow this sort of thing.\n\nA: btrfs balance start -dconvert=raid0 /\nThat's all you need to do.  The system will busily move the existing data around to be raid0 (striped, no parity) and any further data will be written that way as well.\nMETAdata will still be written in duplicate.

Your typical motherboard still has a PCI slot or two, but for graphics cards the PCIe slot is the connection of choice offering much better performance.\nThe Zotac card uses the Nvidia GT 520 GPU and is clocked at 850MHz. The shader clock is running at 1620MHz with 48 shaders available to take advantage of. There’s 512MB of DDR3 memory running at 1333MHz, and your get VGA, DVI, and HMDI connections.

This is exactly the sort of thing it's for.\nTo start a new page, head over to (for example), http://wiki.ubuntu.com/MyNewGreatPage\nThis (assuming the page still doesn't exist yet) will give you a create link, and you can begin editing. The rest is up to you really, if you can being creating a useful resource you'll probably find others will help you along in no time :)\n\nA: Alternatively, I would suggest starting your own site to maintain such lists. If you're not interested in learning HTML/CSS or paying for hosting, you could do what I've done with my hobby site and use Google Sites.\nThen you could share the link with interested users via some sort of social media or your Ask Ubuntu profile, explaining that it is what you would personally recommend for those types of applications.\nIf others create similar list sites that cater to other tastes in software, you could probably link to them from your own page so it's easier for others to find what they're interested in.\nWarning: Be aware that if you decide to start such a site and initially populate it with content from pre-existing lists here on Ask Ubuntu, you may have to keep in mind the license it is under before publishing anything.*\n\n*(It is most likely due to this reason I don't start my own list site...as those who see me in chat would likely point out, I'm infamously paranoid of potential legal issues.)\n\nA: I find alternativeTo really helpful when searching for apps.

Have to say that it does take quite some getting used to after using Windows 7 but it looks great and I think I'm getting the feel for it. Except for a couple of issues.\nFor example: I am an experienced GIMP user, and even make money with it. I had a lot of additional scripts/brushes/fonts/etc added to my GIMP when using Windows 7. Before switching OS I made a backup of those files on my external drive. Now I want to put those back into the GIMP installation in Ubuntu.\nHow do I go about this? I have located the GIMP entry in the 'share' folder, but am not allowed to copy any files to it, the system says I'm not the 'root'. I'm probably doing it wrong; Ubuntu is a whole other world than Windows.\nAny ideas? Thanks in advance!\nEDIT:\nIn general, I might also ask the following question, which will help me with the above and just about all my other issues:\n- Where are my programs located? In other words: What is in Ubuntu, what 'program files' is in Windows? And are there differences between the two? Can you edit files in Ubuntu like you can in Windows?\nWhy I'm asking this, is: a lot of stuff you can download from the web comes with a description similar to \"download this and put the file in .../.../.../...\" Since a lot of programs do not run on Ubuntu, placing in the files manually is the only remaining way to do it, like with the GIMP utilities. Or is there another way?\n\nA: I've written an article on wikihow on how to do this, so check it out here.\nAbout the error, you would have to copy the files in with a sudo command, but I wouldn't recommend it. Using the configuration folders in you home directory doesn't require root permissions, and if you mess things up the worst that can happen is that you would need to create a new user account. Messing with the global settings is dangerous; only use them if absolutely necessary.\nPrograms (at least the scripts that start the programs) are located in /usr/bin, I think, but some are in /opt, too.\nI'm not sure how familiar you are to Linux, but there really isn't really a \"program files\" folder in the same sense that Windows has. All settings are mostly done in separate configuration folders. You will have to know where to put each one.\nHave fun with Ubuntu! It's a great OS, but definitely different from Windows.\n\nA: The best way to go about this is to copy your scripts, brushes and fonts to the Gimp folder in your home directory, where only you can use them. Adding them to the Share directory makes them available to all users, but is more problematic.\nTo add them to your home directory, open your home folder, it looks like this in the launcher:\n\nPress CTRL+H to show hidden files, and open your '.gimp-2.6'folder, the sub-folders you need are in here. Copy the backed up files to their corresponding folders and restart Gimp, you should be good to go.\nTo the second part of your question, the best way to add programs to Ubuntu is to just use the Software Center. It's built-in to Ubuntu and the programs contained are known to be safe to install. Installing is automatic, you don't need to fuss with directories or files, everything is one click install.\n", "Q: Why do my menus have little icons next to the items?

I am affected by this bug: 869502.\nA workaround which seems to stop the kernel panics for me is to disable wlan0 power management:\nsudo iwconfig wlan0 power off\n\nHowever it seems to automatically turn power management back on when I unplug the power cable and I think at many other times, too. \nIs there something that might be causing this? Does anyone know how I can prevent it? \n\nA: My preferred way is to add the following line in /etc/network/interfaces to my wireless interface's settings:\npost-up iwconfig wlan0 power off\n\nHere's a complete example:\nauto wlan0\niface wlan0 inet static\n address 192.168.1.2\n network 192.168.1.0\n netmask 255.255.255.0\n broadcast 192.168.1.255\n gateway 192.168.1.254\n post-up iwconfig wlan0 power off\n wpa-conf /etc/wpa_supplicant/wpa_supplicant.conf\n\nNote that man interfaces says the behaviour of post-up may change in the future.\n\nA: Type iwconfig and look at the output. You should see the name of your chip-set as well as the whether power management is off or on. If it doesn't say, it is probably off.\nTo turn off power management, go to /etc/NetworkManager/conf.d/default-wifi-powersave-on.conf and you will see\n[connection]\nwifi.powersave = 3\n\nChange the 3 to a 2 and reboot.\nThen run iwconfig and if it worked you should see Power Management:off.\nSource: https://sites.google.com/site/easylinuxtipsproject/internet\n\nA: For some reason, the top-voted solutions didn't work for me and power management kept turning back on. I ended up doing the following:\nsudo gedit /etc/rc.local\n\nAnd added the following line before exit 0:\n( sleep 30 && iwconfig wlan0 power off )&\n\nThat turns off power management 30 seconds after logging in...\nEdit: Actually that wasn't enough. I kept trying a bunch of stuff, including https://askubuntu.com/a/614245 which I think solved my problem (I hope).\n\nA: Another approach is to add an explicit directive (wireless-power) to control power management in the /etc/network/interfaces configuration file (e.g. Disable it for wlan0 with DHCP):\nauto wlan0\niface wlan0 inet dhcp     \n  wireless-power off\n\n\nA: Wireless powermanagement is run by a hook in pm-utils. You can turn it off in any of the following way:\nCreate a file in /etc/pm/config.d.\nI have named it blacklist:\ngksu gedit /etc/pm/config.d/blacklist\n\nand inside the file keep:\nHOOK_BLACKLIST=\"wireless\"\n\nIf you want to disable any other hooks, default hooks are located at /usr/lib/pm-utils/power.d/.\nOR\nYou can just create an empty hook in either /etc/pm/sleep.d or /etc/pm/power.d. See which one works for you.\ni.e.\nJust do \nsudo touch /etc/pm/sleep.d/wireless\n\nOR\nsudo touch /etc/pm/power.d/wireless\n\n\nA: If turning off power management for your wireless interface speeds up internet like this:\nsudo iwconfig wlan0 power off\n\nThan to make it permanent run command as follows:\n\n\n*\n\n*cd /etc/pm/power.d\n\n*sudo gedit wifi_pwr_off\nThis will open an empty file, copy the code below into it:\n#!/bin/sh \n/sbin/iwconfig wlan0 power off\n\n\n*Save the file, remember to\nsudo chmod +x wifi_pwr_off\n\nand restart.\n\nA: A better approach (at least on Ubuntu 16.04) is to create /etc/network/if-up.d/wifi-powerman-off with the following contents:\n#!/bin/sh\n\nIWCONFIG=/sbin/iwconfig\nWLAN_IFACE=<your wireless device here>\n\nif [ ! -x $IWCONFIG ]; then\n    exit 1\nfi\n\nif [ \"$IFACE\" = $WLAN_IFACE ]; then\n    $IWCONFIG $IFACE power off\nfi\n\nand set it as executable. Power management will be off from the next time you connect to a network.\nThis works well with NetworkManager.\n\nA: Great advice. 'sudo iwconfig wlan0 power off' seems the only way to get my ath9k module stabily working (with kernel 3.2 - curiously in kernel > 3.5 there seems to be no problem, but that kernels because of their suspend-to-ram/disk problems with amd64 seem to be a no go, unfortunately . . . :-( )\n\nA: If you use laptop-mode-tools, then you can disable wireless power management by editing /etc/laptop-mode/conf.d/wireless-iwl-power.conf (Ubuntu 14.04):\n# Control Intel IWL wireless power?\n# Set to 0 to disable\nCONTROL_IWL_POWER=0\n\n\nA: I created the following systemd service to PERSISTENTLY kill Power Management on WiFi across reboots.  Tested and known to work.  Just paste the below bash script into a file, chmod 700 the file and sudo ./yourFileName.sh :\nif [ -d /root/scripts ]; then\n    mkdir /root/scripts\nfi\n\napt-get -y install iw\napt-get -y install wireless-tools\n\ncat <<EOF> /root/scripts/pwr-mgmnt-wifi-disable.sh\n#!/bin/bash\niw dev wlan0 set power_save off\nEOF\n\nchmod 700 /root/scripts/pwr-mgmnt-wifi-disable.sh\n\n\ncat <<EOF> /etc/systemd/system//pwr-mgmnt-wifi-disable.service\n[Unit]\nDescription=Disable WiFi Power Management\nRequires=network-online.target\nAfter=hostapd.service\n\n[Service]\nUser=root\nGroup=root\nType=oneshot\nExecStart=/root/scripts/pwr-mgmnt-wifi-disable.sh\n\n[Install]\nWantedBy=multi-user.target\n\nEOF\n\nchmod 644 /etc/systemd/system/pwr-mgmnt-wifi-disable.service\n\nsystemctl enable pwr-mgmnt-wifi-disable.service\nsystemctl start pwr-mgmnt-wifi-disable.service\n\n\nA: Why not open crontab and add the command at boot/reboot.\nThis seems like the easiest and most universal method:\nsudo crontab -e\n\nand then add\n@reboot iwconfig wlan0 power off\n\nCould be that you have to install iwconfig first: sudo apt install wireless-tools\n", "Q: Where did printer driver settings go on a Canon IP 3100? I have had my Canon IP 3100 printer for years, and with every version of Ubuntu, since around 8 or so, it has been auto detected and worked perfectly.\nNow, with Ubuntu 11.10, it has been detected as some kind of \"generic text only printer\", and I can't even print a test page.\nI've looked at the printer interface, and there doesn't seem to be any way at all to manually select the right printer driver.\nThis is all there is in the printer dialogue in the settings manager:\n\nThe only place to go is \"Options\", but if you do that, all you get is this:\n\nNot much to go on.\nI have also tried removing it and reinstalling it, but that has not helped.\nHow do I get my printer drivers back?\n\nA: Solution seemed to be a two part thing. One was following the instructions here.\nIt didn't work at first, though. Part of the key seems to be to not try and install the drivers using the interface above, but instead close that, turn the printer on, and use the dialog that comes up when the printer first connects.\nAnyway... had to go back to the command line in 11.10. Not a step forward IMHO. But at least the printer is working now.\n\nA: Click this: http://localhost:631\nI had a same problem. But now solved. I also use Ubuntu 11.10(amd64) and Canon iP-3100.\n", "Q: Videos, songs, and all media playing in fast forward Whenever I try to play a video or song, on YouTube or using Banshee, the media plays as if it's in fast forward.

I'm running Ubuntu 11.10 64-bit on my HP Pavillion Dv7-4285dx, no modifications to my hardware or software.\n\nA: Check if your speakers are working. You can test this from System Settings / Sound / Hardware tab. \nI had the same problem this morning. The reason this happened for me - I changed the device for sound output from analog to HDMI while fiddling with the sound settings last night. You can check the device you are using from System Settings / Sound / Output tab.\n\nA: Easy. Go to System Settings / Sound / Hardware tab. In the Hardware tab, select your HDMI device and in the 'Profile' combo box below, select off. It should default back to your Internal Audio device instantly at this point. Problem solved.\n", "Q: Turn off wine debugging How do I make wine not showing any debug messages the default setting? I've found WINEDEBUG=-all wine ./program.exe as a way to turn off debug for the program I'm currently running, but how do I make it the default for everything?\n\nA: WINEDEBUG is an environment variable that is set for only for the invocation of wine.\nWhat you need to do is make the environment variable permanent, which you can do in your ~/.bashrc.\nOpen it in your favourite editor and add to the bottom:\nexport WINEDEBUG=-all\n\nThe next new Terminal you open will trigger that setting and wine ./program.exe should inherit it.\nSince .bashrc is just a series of shell commands that are run when a Terminal is started, you can just type the same thing into a Terminal as well; but then it will be lost when you close that Terminal.\n", "Q: How do I make Update Manager stop opening automatically? Update Manager keeps opening automatically and it's getting very annoying, especially when I'm using Gnome Shell. How do I make it stop?\n\nA: I found this post with the following instruction:\n\nopen gconf-editor, browse down to Apps -> Update Notifier, and uncheck the auto_launch option\n\n\nOK, try this one.  It's similar to the other answer but disables it instead of deleting it entirely.  It might be safer for you to open the file in an editor and change the line by hand instead of the sed command that post uses.\nThe procedure, using an editor:\n\n\n*\n\n*Open a terminal\n\n*Move to the autostart directory (cd /etc/xdg/autostart) and list the files there (ls).\n\n*Find the startup program you want to run (in our case update-notifier.desktop) and open it in an editor (gksudo gedit update-notifier.desktop).  Enter your password if necessary.\n\n*Be careful not to change anything except this line.  Find this line:NoDisplay=true and change it to:NoDisplay=false\n\n*Save the file and exit.\n\n*Reboot to make sure it worked.\n\n\nA: In Precise, it is done using dconf now rather than gconf.\n\n\n*\n\n*Install dconf-tools\n$ sudo apt-get install dconf-tools\n\n*run dconf-editor and navigate to com > ubuntu > update-notifier.\n\n*Tick no-show-notifications\n\nAnd here's how to do it from the command line:\ndconf write /com/ubuntu/update-notifier/no-show-notifications true\n\n\nA: Ubuntu 12.04 LTS\nThe Update Manager pops up when it detects a new update. This behaviour can be pretty annoying for many, especially when you are in the midst of your work. To make it worst, if you close it without updating, it will keep on popping up in regular intervals and each time after boot, until you have upgraded your system. To turn it off:\nMethod 1 - Disable Update Notifier from autostart\nThe Update Notifier autostarts on boot and triggers Update Manager. In this method, we prevent the Update Notifier itself from autostarting,so that Update Manager won't be triggered. Edit Update Notifier's entry in systemwide autostarts - /etc/xdg/autostart/update-notifier.desktop ( Note that you wont be able to use the Startup Applications app,as it only deals with per-user autostart entries ) and add the following line:\nX-GNOME-Autostart-enabled=false\n\nReboot now, and you'll find that there's no Update Notification.\n\nDisadvantage: This disables automatic Update Notifications altogether.You'll have to manually check for updates(which is fine by me,but may not be for some people)\nMethod 2 - Show Update Indicator\nThis option makes the Update Notifier show an Update Indicator in the panel, instead of popping up the Update Manager. I think this should be the default setting for Update Notifier in Ubuntu. To do it:\nGraphical Way: Open dconf Editor. Navigate to com->ubuntu->update-notifier. Uncheck the entry auto-launch and close dconf Editor. To recover the Update Manager popup function, simply repeat the above step, but place a check in the auto-launch entry.\n\nCommand Way: For the terminal lovers out there, type in these commands to do the same.\ngsettings set com.ubuntu.update-notifier auto-launch false\n\nand to recover:\ngsettings set com.ubuntu.update-notifier auto-launch true\n\nThese methods were tested and found to be working on Ubuntu 12.04 LTS with update-manager version 0.156.14.11. I got the idea from the post How to Remove The Annoying Update manager Pop-up in Ubuntu Jaunty and simply modified it to work on Ubuntu 12.04 LTS aka Precise Pangolin\n\nA: This may work for you. I haven't verified if it works in GNOME.\n\n\n*\n\n*Open the Software Sources application.\n\n*Select the \"Updates\" tab.\n\n*For the \"Automatically check for updates\" option, select Never.\n\n\n\nAfter this, you will have to open the Update Manager application manually.\n\nA: In order to stop Update Manager from launching:\ngconftool -s --type bool /apps/update-notifier/auto_launch false\n\nTo activate it again:\ngconftool -s --type bool /apps/update-notifier/auto_launch true\n\nHope it helps ;)\n\nA: Edit  /etc/update-manager/release-upgrades and set:\nPrompt=never change this with your favorite editor.\nNever use update-manager with -d this checks whether the next release is available or not.\n\nA: Should be \ngconftool -s --type bool /apps/update-notifier/auto_launch false\n\n", "Q: How do I access my ubuntu on cloud from a browser?

If the routine is defined in such a way that it doesn’t\n  require any further cleanup once it detects an error, not [exiting]\n  immediately means that you have to write more code.\n\nSo normally one exit is preferred (people looking at your code don't have to find the correct exit statement), however with error checking (especially at the start of a program/routine having multiple exit statements is clearer.\nYour example is borderline, however I would say that the second is preferred so that maintenance to your program/script can leave it tidy.\nYour program currently is (in psudocode)\nif error condition 1\n    // Show error message 1\nelse\n    // Do stuff\nfi\n\nor\nif error condition 1\n    // Show error message 1\n    // exit\nfi\n\n// Do stuff\n\n\nOnce your program has grown, you realise some more ways that the program can fail.

The best way to accomplish this is to make a PDF file. There should be a PDF button on your toolbar. Just make a PDF and you can print your file anywhere.\n\nA: As for why this happens -- I've had similar problems with LibreOffice not saving images in docx format. Essentially, the problem seems to be that the specification of the file formats of doc and docx are either very long or not actually available when the Libreoffice team created the filters to create doc/docx files.

In this  architecture, traditionally the Linux kernel has split the 4GB of virtual memory address space into 3GB for user programs and 1GB for the kernel. \n....\nCoping with highmem\nHowever, many people insist on using more than 1GB of physical memory\n  on such a 32 bit system. This makes it necessary for the Linux kernel\n  to jump through some interesting hoops...\nBasically the system uses the following tactics:\nMemory above the physical address of 896MB are temporarily mapped into kernel \n  virtual memory whenever the kernel needs to access that  memory.\nData which the kernel frequently needs to access is allocated in the lower 896MB of memory (ZONE_NORMAL) and can be immediately\n  accessed by the kernel (see Temporary mapping).\n...\n\nSo, I think we only see kernel reserved memory space with /proc/kcore. By the way, I am using an 32bit Ubuntu version, too.\n", "Q: Eclipse not using dual core on ubuntu 9.10 I am using eclipse on Ubuntu 10.10 32bit, when I am compiling a huge android project, it is getting slower I have 4GB ram even (which is just 25% used) though its getting slower when I observed further eclipse is using only one CPU and creating 100% load on that where as other CPU is having only 20% load, is this eclipse problem or Ubuntu problem \n\nA: Taken from eclipse's wiki page.\n\nMulti-Core CPU\nDue to power constraints, there is a trend towards multiple cores on a CPU instead of merely increasing the CPU frequency. Eclipse could enable developers to write multi-threaded programs to take advantage of the increasing miltiple cores. Moreover, Eclipse itself could be optimized where possible for running on multiple cores.\n\nEclipse it self itself has not multi-thread support, that means that no mater how many CPUs/CPU cores you have eclipse will run in one of your cores only.\nMore over, the ability for a compiler to use multiple CPUs/CPU cores will depend on which language you are using to develop your Android project.\nSome compilers will be able to use multiple CPUs/CPU cores during compilation even if the IDE you are using does not take advantage of those.\nThe Linux Kernel has support for multiple CPUs/Cores in one system since Kernel version 2.0 allowing your programs to take advantage of that, but the program itself has to have support for multiple CPUs/Cores.\nFor more information on how Symetric multiprocessing works can be found here.\nIn short: Ubuntu has support for SMP because current Kernel version is < 2.0 (also on 9.10 as you know) but eclipse lacks the habitability to use multiple CPUs/Cores. Also even if eclipse had it it would (during project build) depend on the language and compiler you are using for your project.\nThis is all true no mater what compiler you are using including the ones in the Android SDK.\n\nA: Eclipse and the Java Development Kit used by Eclipse has approximately nothing to do with your development, with the development of an Android Application using the standard SDK.\nTo clarify this point you can consider 3 important facts:\n\n\n*\n\n*you can build a complete Android App from the source without using Eclipse\n\n*Eclipse is only an IDE for the Android SDK, a group of graphical elements that can speed up your workflow, nothing more and nothing less\n\n*Eclipse uses a JDK environment when the Android SDK does not ( the A. SDK uses nothing else rather then the SDK itself ), they simply use different environments to run and build apps, so it's simply misleading saying something like \"Eclipse not using dual core when compiling a huge Android project\"\n\n\nI think that at this point should be clear the fact that your app is actually compiled by the SDK itself and what you are stressing as bad thing is usually referred as a good thing.\nMultithreaded application and, in general, application ( with \"application\" right now i mean the SDK not your app ) that supports their execution splitted in several jobs, brings a big problem on the table: a good and effective debugging phase.\nLet's say that you are compiling something splitted in 4 threads, in the istant X your compiler crash, the question is: which of the 4 is the bad guy? all of them? just 1? 2? 3?\nConsidering that a tipical use of the Android SDK is not heavily based on multi-threaded design ( with that i mean that a developer can wait 1 or 2 minutes in the worst case scenario, nothing changes and the debug in multi-threaded environment with some concurrency on the go is much more complex and can take you weeks without achieving any results ), the adoption of a multi-threaded design can easily provide more cons than pros, especially during the phase of compiling and debugging.\nIn the end considering the audience of developers, the target of Android, what an Android application really is, this kind of software design is probably the most appropriate and effective and i will not considering the lack of a multi-threading compiling a bad thing.\n\nA: Presuming you use make as the project builder, and your dependencies are written correctly, your best best is probably to use parallel make. I think eclipse has a tick-box for that, but if not just add -j2 to the builder parameters (where '2' is the number of jobs to run concurrently - experiment and see what's best for you).\n", "Q: KDE telepathy releases 0.2 I'm currently using the KDE telepathy PPA thats newly updated to telepathy-kde-0.2 and I'm running into a serios blocker which won't let me log into any of my accounts.\nOn using the Account Manager it just displays the message:\n- \"There was a problem while trying to connect ********@gmail.com- #(or any other account for that matter)# Some of the IM components are not working correctly (and your system does not tell us which one).\nI would like to know if this is persistent for others as well or is it something with my conf, note i've been using the PPA since conception.\nThanks in advance\nImage attached to show problem.\n\n\nA: For some reason you need to create the directory .cache/dconf which isn't created.\n", "Q: ATI EAH4350 adapter configuration I have an ati eah4350 adapter and the latest Ubuntu 11.10.\nI connected the adapter using HDMI and i didn't have sound.\nSo i installed fglrx using the readme from their site.\nNow i have sound but the picture isn't smooth in videos as it was before installing\nthe fglrx.\nHow can it be repaired?\nThanks\n\nA: Remove and disable every radeon and fglrx packages from the official repository, just follow the instrunctions at this page http://wiki.cchtml.com/index.php/Main_Page and everything will run fine.\nThe HDMI audio bridge it's not automatically activated and you have to switch between your audio output devices using the \"Audio Settings\" menu under the volume control on the system bar.

I seem to have misconfigured sshd so that it does not start up on reboot. Since this is a server, I now do not have shell access to my server anymore. Any ssh request results in this:\nssh: connect to host xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx port 22: Connection refused\nAnd /var/run/sshd.pid does not exist. \nI do have access to the file system through a Virtuozzo Panel the server provider has installed. \nI have not edited the /etc/init.d/ssh start script but I did copy it to /etc/rc2.d/ssh in hopes that this would start ssh at reboot. \nI also tried adding a startup call to /etc/crontab:\n7 * * * * root /usr/bin/touch /root/cron_is_running\n8 * * * * root /etc/init.d/ssh start\nNeither do I get the file /root/cron_is_running nor is sshd starting up\nMy logfiles do not provide much in the way of error messages for ssh, f.e. /var/log/syslog only shows a lot of named stuff at startup and some mysql upgrade stuff, that is surely not related. \nI appreciate any help, I already configured a bunch of things on that server and by installing a new image I would loose all data on the server. \nUpdate: Changing the script in /etc/rc2.d/ssh to /etc/rc2.d/S90ssh did not have any effect. /var/log/auth.log does not contain any lines that hint at ssh trying to start up, it is full of these lines however:\nUpdate 2: As suggested I also tried adding /usr/sbin/sshd to /etc/rc.local. But a test with touch /tmp/test seems to suggest this file is not executed despite +x flag being set. I also tried adding sleep 10 at the beginning of the rc.local script because it was suggested elsewhere that this script had concurrency issues. \nFinal Update\nThanks to the below answers again. They were huge help in fixing the missing sshd startup in the rcX.d/ directories. The final fix was to start a \"Repair\" from the Virtuozzo Panel, this mounts the original system as part of the filesystem of a recovery system with the original network settings. I could log into that with ssh. I copied the working ssh configs from the recovery system over the ssh configs of the broken original system, finished the recovery and now I can log in again. \n\nA: Your attempt at copying to /etc/rc2.d/ssh was almost right.\nIn order for a script in /etc/rcX.d to be run at startup, it has to be called SxxZZZ where S is a literal S (for Start; you can also use K for Kill at shutdown time), xx is a number representing where in the order of startup it runs (01 first, 99 last), and ZZZ is your script name.\nSo, you'd want something like S90ssh. The number isn't critically important, 90 should be ok, the network will be up by then etc.\nNote it will also have to be set executable - I don't know if the system you're using will allow you to do that? Hopefully copying the existing ssh script and simply renaming will keep the executable bits set.\nAs an alternative, /etc/rc.local can be used as a generic all-purpose startup script. Simply drop /usr/sbin/sshd in there before the exit line to get sshd started as a last resort.\nGive that a go and update your question if you're still having trouble :)\nYou can check in /var/log/auth.log (/var/log/syslog does not contain sshd messages by default) for a line like:\nsshd[18838]: Server listening on 0.0.0.0 port 22.\n\nto see if it's starting.\n\nA: If you go to /etc/init.d/ type sudo service ssh start and it comes clean (no faults) you only need to run sudo update-rc.d ssh defaults to make the service come up on the right levels and be killed when your system is going to shutdown.\nYou can also do that manually copying the script and renaming it to either indicate that it should be stopped or started on that level. Here are the files that are created with the update-rc.d command:\n   /etc/rc0.d/K20ssh -> ../init.d/ssh\n   /etc/rc1.d/K20ssh -> ../init.d/ssh\n   /etc/rc6.d/K20ssh -> ../init.d/ssh\n   /etc/rc2.d/S20ssh -> ../init.d/ssh\n   /etc/rc3.d/S20ssh -> ../init.d/ssh\n   /etc/rc4.d/S20ssh -> ../init.d/ssh\n   /etc/rc5.d/S20ssh -> ../init.d/ssh\n\nSo a simple cp /etc/init.d/ssh /etc/rc0(1,6).d/K20ssh and cp /etc/init.d/ssh /etc/rc2(3,4,5).d/K20ssh should do the trick. (note that you have to run cp for each rc.d folder, the command is just an example of what name to give to the copied files).\nK20ssh is run when the machine is going to shutdown and S20ssh is the name of the script for the levels where it should run.\nS and K indicate start or kill and the number after it indicates the order on which the scripts inside the folder will run, a lower number makes run earlier and a higher number makes it run later, in case of ssh it should really not mather but 20 its the default assigned by update-rc.d.\n", "Q: How to load graphical display manager when booting?

Anyway to fix this, I removed lightdm and went back to using GDM which is GNOME display manager. It's extremely ugly but at least it lets you boot.\nIn order to do that you should follow these steps:\n\n\n*\n\n*When in the black ugly screen hold down Ctrl + Alt + F1. If nothing happens hold F2 instead.\n\n*Enter your credentials\n\n*sudo vi /etc/X11/default-display-manager\n\n*Change it to /usr/sbin/gdm\n(If you're not familiar with vi: edit, then save by entering :\nthen wq! )\n\n*sudo reboot\n\nMy answer to the question:\nWhen the loading stops with the 'ugly black screen', enter one of the ttys (for example Ctrl + Alt + F1) and login into your system. \nThen enter sudo service lightdm restart \nIf it says unrecognized service, try the command sudo apt-get install lightdm \nThis should ensure that Lightdm is properly installed.\n\nA: I suggest you retry everything.

If I have too many things running at a time, the system becomes quite slow (disk I/O seems to be the bottleneck), so I am careful to avoid this. Naturally, I want to be in control of when resource-hungry things run.\nI do all my package management from the terminal. I use Byobu, and have set it to show the number of packages to be upgraded in the bottom row.\nEvery now and then Update Manager pops up to inform me about updates. This seems to be an a very resource-hungry application - it causes disk thrashing, and the window starts out as being unresponsive (Compiz makes it grey), and takes a long time to start accepting mouse input. This causes a disruption in whatever I'm doing, and the Update Manager doesn't even go away quickly after I click the cross button in the title bar.\nSo here is what I want:\n\n\n*\n\n*The system should automatically check for updates as it does now. This is fine.\n\n*The Update Manager window should never open unless I manually open it. I can see that there are packages to upgrade at the bottom of my terminal window, and I don't want the system to spring bloated GUI windows on me when I'm not expecting it.\n\n\nIs there  a way to do this? I guess I could disable the Update Manager automatic checks and learn about cron and use that to do a aptitude update at regular intervals... but there should be a better, more direct way! But there is no \"do nothing\" option in the dialog box below:\n\n\nA: You can change this behaviour with dconf Editor. Install the package dconf-tools.

I need to alter sources.list I am able to make the changes but it will not save, keeps saying I don't have the permissions to do that.\n\nA: You need root privileges to edit that file. Open the file from a terminal and type \"sudo\" in front of your editor of choice. More on sudo: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sudo\nFor example:\nsudo nano /etc/apt/sources.list\n\nNano is a fairly simple editor. See this question How to edit files in a terminal with nano? if you want to know more on how to use it.\n\nA: You can use gedit as your text editor, which is the default text editor on Ubuntu 11.10 and edit the /etc/apt/sources.list file by running this command:\ngksudo gedit /etc/apt/sources.list\n\nWhat this does is it opens the file with root privileges using gedit, which is your default text editor.\n\nA: To be able to edit files with root privileges directly from the standard file browser, Nautilus, install nautilus-gksu. This will add a \"Open as administrator\" entry to the context (right click) menu in Nautilus.\n\nTo install, in a terminal, type\nsudo apt-get install nautilus-gksu\n\nTo get the entry to show in 11.10 also run\nsudo cp /usr/lib/nautilus/extensions-2.0/libnautilus-gksu.so /usr/lib/nautilus/extensions-3.0/\n\nThen log out and in again, and go to the sources.list file in Nautilus.

I could be reaching here, but it's worth a shot.\n@jpyper on Twitter.\n\nA: In my question above, I stated that the BIOS saw the 6GB. I said this because when booting, as it showed the device info etc before booting, it listed 6GB of RAM.\nJohn suggested I look for a setting for HPET and in doing so, I discovered that the BIOS Setup was reporting that the only usable amount of System Memory was something like 4.3GB.\nThis obviously shows it wasn't a Ubuntu problem (wish I'd found this sooner!) and replaceing one of the 2GB sticks for 2x 1GB sticks gives me the 6GB I was looking for.\nMy memory config before was:\nDIMM0: 2GB DDR2\nDIMM1: 2GB DDR2\nDIMM2: 2GB DDR2\nDIMM3: EMPTY\n\nMy configuration now is:\nDIMM0: 2GB DDR2\nDIMM1: 1GB DDR2\nDIMM2: 2GB DDR2\nDIMM3: 1GB DDR2\n\nThis only came about because I had to remove a faulty stick!

I'm not sure both would fit this forum, but as I suspect the first might have caused the later, here they go:\n\n\n*\n\n*Today, when I tried to restart my computer and boot Windows from internal HDD NTFS partition, I got a blue screen with error code 0x0024 (a lot more 0's there), saying a problem was detected and Windows has been shutdown to prevent damage, etc... no useful information. I couldn't even boot in the safe mode. My first thought was I might still be able to access the windows file system from linux, what took me to the next problem:\n\n\n*After booting ubuntu from the USB drive, I tried to access the windows filesystem from GUI menu \"Places -> 54GB Filesystem\", but it says \"according to mtab /dev/sda2 is already mounted on /media/227C59C27C599181\". Trying to mount from the command line also doesn't work, it says sda2 is already mounted on wherever I try to mount it. Trying to open /etc/mtab says \"Input/Output error\". I noticed the following error message on dmesg: \"EXT2-fs error (device loop1): ext2_lookup: deleted inode referenced: 98399.\"\n\n\nIs it possible that a disk partition failure may have caused the /etc/mtab damage? \nCan I recover/repair the /etc/mtab file? How?\nAdditionally, I also tried booting with a Windows XP install disk (not the same I've on my disk, as that is still factory installed), hoping I could use the system repair option. The windows installation system recognized my hard drive, all partitions are shown correctly, except that for the C partition the filesystem type is displayed as \"unknown\".\nThanks in advance, to anyone who can provide some advice on what I could do to solve either of these problems.\nUPDATE: I managed to fix my NTFS partition by running CHKDSK from HBCD, and now I can boot on windows again. However, I've not yet get back to linux to see if that would eventually solve to mtab issue too.\n\nA: No, mtab wouldn't have contributed to the fault. Though writing\nto your NTFS volume from Linux might, that support isn't full proof\nand can cause corruption. If you did that then I don't\nknow what else I could recommend to you except to get Windows to\nrun chkdsk and cross your fingers.

Recently I started having a problem when checking for updates: the process stalled for several minutes while connecting to the medibuntu site.  This happened every time. (Mysteriously, this only happened on one of my two computers.)  Getting tired of this, I unchecked Medibuntu in my software sources, and everything speeded up again.\nIs this something I will regret?  I have some things installed from Medibuntu, but once installed do I get anything by getting updates from Medibuntu?  Or are things now provided elsewhere - like in Multiverse - sufficiently now so that I no longer need Medibuntu?\n\nA: If you have the PPA or Repository active then you will get any updates they make. If you have it disabled then you will be left with whatever you downloaded from them. It will not create any problem if you disable or remove the repository since you have already downloaded what you need it. The only thing is that any updates to their repository will not be reflected as updates in your PC (Since you do not have the repository active of course).\nNow for the question as such, the packages in 11.10 and am guessing future versions have most if not all needed codecs and multimedia packages needed for everything to work correctly.\nIt is common now to install the ubuntu-restricted-addons and ubuntu-restricted-extras (It is so common that the installer gives you that option to select) and get many of the packages that medibuntu has. And if there are any missing you can find them in the repositories of Ubuntu without the need to add medibuntu. For example mencoder, the dvd authoring stuff, etc..\n\nA: I believe in recent versions of Ubuntu, multiverse repository contains most of the required packages. But, some enhanced codecs are not include due to licensing issue. (Because they are not free, as freedom). Those packages are maintained by medibuntu repostiory.\n\nIs this something I will regret?\n\nNo, actually. If you already installed all the necessary codecs.

I have a Macbook Pro 5,2 and I've had a sporadic problem with having to reinstall GRUB after a system update. This has happened with several of the recent versions of Ubuntu, although I don't have an exact record of which ones. \nEvery once in a while, after a system update with the update manager, I can no longer boot into Ubuntu unless I repair the GRUB installation manually. To do that I follow this procedure:\nhttps://help.ubuntu.com/community/Grub2#Reinstalling_GRUB2\nby following the instructions under ChRoot.  That always works to reinstall things, but as you can imagine, it's not my favorite thing to do and takes about a half hour each time.  \nOne problem I run into when trying to follow those instructions is that when I get to step #11 where I am supposed to run grub-install /dev/sda, it always tells me that I cannot execute that command because it would have to use \"blocklists\" which are inherently unstable, and the the only way to proceed is to use the --force option on grub-install.  So I use the --force option and it does install it, but the fact that it does not go according to the instructions has me concerned that perhaps that is the source of the instability that the warning is telling me about.  But it won't let me reinstall it any other way.\nAs background information I might mention as background that I have Refit installed on the Mac side, in case that is a source of the problem because it's conflicting with or fighting with Grub over the boot sector or something like that.  I also have not been able to boot into OS/X from Grub even though it's on the Grub startup menu.  It just hangs and does nothing if I select that.  In order to boot into OS/X I have to use the hardware support on the Mac by pressing the option key while it's booting and then selecting the OS/X partition, which then boots via Refit.  Conversely I cannot boot into Ubuntu via Refit even though that partition shows up on the Refit menu (as a Windows partition because I think Refit assumes anything that isn't OS/X is \"Windows\"). Finally here is the output of sudo fdisk -l for my system:\nWARNING: GPT (GUID Partition Table) detected on '/dev/sda'! The util \nfdisk doesn't support GPT.

The entire Macbook Pro dual boot process is a bit of a mystery to me, so I am including as much information as I can in case some of it is useful.  Thanks in advance for any help.\n\nA: My first reaction is to note that you're using a hybrid MBR, which is an ugly and dangerous hack that Apple uses to simplify dual-boots with OS X. Your fdisk output only shows the MBR side of the hybrid MBR, but both OS X and Linux ignore this, instead favoring the GPT side. To show the GPT partitions, you'll need to use parted, gdisk, or some other GPT-aware utility.\nSecond, the \"blocklists\" error suggests that you've booted in BIOS mode (using the compatibility system Apple created for use by Windows), but your GPT doesn't include a BIOS Boot Partition, which GRUB 2 uses on GPT disks to store part of its BIOS-mode boot loader. One way around this error is to tweak your partitions so that you do have a BIOS Boot Partition. This can probably be done relatively painlessly, but there might be unintended consequences to such a change. In particular, if you need to resize any partitions with GParted, it's likely to wipe out the hybrid MBR, which will prevent the system from booting Linux in its current configuration because the hybrid MBR is what activates the Mac's BIOS compatibility mode. This problem can be corrected by creating a fresh hybrid MBR.\nSince you don't seem to have Windows, you may want to look into booting Linux in EFI mode, which will obviate the need for the BIOS compatibility layer and the hybrid MBR. I've got a Web page about doing this: http://www.rodsbooks.com/ubuntu-efi/index.html. In brief, the procedure from a working Ubuntu installation is to uninstall grub-pc and to install and configure grub-efi or some other EFI-capable boot loader. This method has its drawbacks, though. In particular, on some systems some hardware (possibly including video hardware) may not be activated, which in extreme cases can make the system unusable.\nIncidentally, rEFIt isn't likely to be a problem; it's an EFI-mode boot manager that doesn't conflict with BIOS-mode boot programs. rEFIt seems to have been abandoned, though. My fork, rEFInd, picks up development, adding features and fixing bugs. It's got some options that are particularly useful for booting Linux, but some of these apply only if you've got a 3.3.0 or later kernel, which no version of Ubuntu yet provides.\n", "Q: Installing acroread without browser plugin The acroread packages includes both the standalone viewer and the browser plugin.

My computer is connected to the Internet through a wifi-router. I want to have access to my computer remotely, for example using ssh.\nWhen I ask my computer what my IP address is, for example by going in the network indicator, I get 192.168.1.101. But when I go on a website as whatismyip.com, I get a totally different address, probably the one of my router.\nSo what address should I use to access my own computer remotely and not any other machine in my home wifi-network?\n\nA: You will need to configure port forwarding, and will need access to the Administration Panel on the router. \nLog in as the Administrative user on your router, Usually by typing either:\nhttp://192.168.1.1 or http://192.168.1.255 considering what you have listed as your local ip-address.\nLook through your settings and try to find Port Forwarding. This is where you can specify to permit access to unique machines within your LAN. \nHere is a screen shot of my tab with one of my ssh settings:\n\nThere is a really good website (at least it's one I've liked using in the past) that has screen shots and other helpful info located here. If you'd like more specific help leave some comments and I will try and help further. You might be able to find your specific router in their list.\nOnce you find that, you just add the internal address that you want to permit access to, and specify the ports want them forwarding to (or range of ports). \nSo like in your example, where you already have identified your external address... after setting up the portforwarding for SSH with port 22 (which I wouldn't recommend). You would then be able to access your machine by ssh by typing: \nssh <username>@<the_address_you_viewed_on_whatismyip>\n\nIf you decided to permit port 22 / or \nssh <username>@<the_address_you_viewed_on_whatismyip> -p <non-standard port#>\n\nIf you chose to use a non-standard one.\n\nA: Okay, others have already answered but I've typed too much to hit cancel :P\nTo access computers inside your home network from an outside network, you need to use the IP address displayed by whatismyip.org.  192.168.1.101 in this case is your internal LAN IP address assigned to your system by your router via DHCP.  The outside world does not see this.  As your router handles incoming and outgoing network traffic, it translates between your \"real\" IP address and the various internal IP addresses inside your network.  This is called Network Address Translation or NAT for short.  Wikipedia has a nice analogy:\n\nA NAT device is similar to a phone system at an office that has one\n  public telephone number and multiple extensions. Outbound phone calls\n  made from the office all appear to come from the same telephone\n  number. However, an incoming call that does not specify an extension\n  cannot be transferred to an individual inside the office. In this\n  scenario, the office is a private LAN, the main phone number is the\n  public IP address, and the individual extensions are unique port\n  numbers\n\nYou'll also need to setup some port forwarding rules on your router.  The instructions for this depend on what kind of router you have but the basic idea is that you are telling your router: \"Hey, if you see any incoming traffic on port 22, send it to the computer that has 192.168.1.101 as its IP address\".  Of course, change the port number and ip addresses as suits whatever it is you are trying to use.\nYou can usually access your router's configuration settings by opening a browser and typing in 192.168.1.1 or 192.168.1.0 for the address.  You can execute netstat -rn and look at the last line to find the correct address if you are not sure.\nNow comes the tricky part.  Unless you tell your router \"Always give this computer the IP address 192.168.1.101\", there is no guarantee it will always be that...but it probably will.  Moreover, your public IP address is probably also assigned via DHCP from your Internet service provider.  So, if you reset your modem or if enough time goes by, your public IP address can also change and you'll have to look it up again at whatismyip.org.  There are ways around these issues but I've typed enough for now and I think it's a separate question.  Hope that clears some stuff up!\n\nA: Many routers will update a Dynamic DNS service.  This is the best way to access your server remotely.  You will need to register with the Dynamic DNS service before you can use it.  Check which ones your router supports, if any, before you register.\nAs other have commented you will need to enable either port forwarding (recommended) or DMZ access to your server.  \nYour router has one address on the Internet.  It uses DHCP to provide IP addresses in a private address range (192.168...) to your computers and device.  The router will translate addresses to and from the Internet.  This is known as Network Address Translation (NAT) and provides some protection. \nEDIT:  Given you are running Ubuntu.  Look at things you can do to secure your system against Internet attacks:\n\n\n*\n\n*Use strong passwords for all your user-ids.  Consider using keys rather than passwords for remote access.\n\n*Setup a firewall.  UFW may already be installed, but I prefer Shorewall.\n\n*Setup /etc/hosts.allow and/or /etc/hosts.deny to limit access to services.  \n\n*Use SSH or HTTPS rather than telnet or HTTP to access your server with passwords. Also use SFTP or scp rather than FTP to transfer files.\n\n*Install a log scanner like logcheck to scan your logs and notify you of things which might indicate an attack.\n\n*Install fail2ban to blacklist attackers.\n\n*If you are running Apache ensure that the server can't write its content directories.  Also review the ACLs in the configuration and update to meet your needs.\n\n\nYou don't need to do all of these (except use strong passwords).  But each thing you do increases your security.\n\nA: Basically you have two ip address. One that's your internet (that your router uses), and one that is local per each computer on your local network. You local ips are generally not accessible outside your network In order to access your local machine from the outside world, you need to set it in your router that anything that hits your router (internet ip) on a specific port, is redirected to a local machine's local port. Do this in your router settings.\n\nA: OR ...\nYou can use team viewer and cut out any config at all :)\nIt is free for personal use \nhttp://teamviewer.com\nAm not being rude, but the very nature of your question indicates you should not attempt ANY changes to your routers firewall until you get a grounding in the basics of network function and security.

After installing Lamp on my personally Ubuntu computer, I am running a application that needs to connect to the web to send SMTP mail; for example,  paypal needs a www address to notify about successful or failed payments...\nI managed to fix the issue by acquiring a free .tk domain, changing my router preference, and port forwarding to my computer IP.\nIs this secure? I have a firewall, restricting only access to port:80. It is my personal computer, where I have personal files (with exception of my /var/www folder). \nIs there a better alternative?\nI was thinking of installing a Ubuntu Server on VMware Workstation, and port forwarding to the virtual server instead, but it might take too much resources.\n\nA: It will be as secure as your Web server configuration and your Web application, just like it would be were it deployed on a \"real\" Web server. If the Web server is running as the www-data user, you could change your home directory permissions to something that the www-data user cannot read:\ncd ~\nchmod 750 .\n\nRun that while logged in as your own username. The rest cannot be guessed without lots information from you including the Web application itself. But, at least this much may offer a little more peace of mind knowing your files in your home directory will not be read.\nAdd another layer by creating a .htaccess file in the DOCUMENT_ROOT (/var/www/ ?) so that anyone who access the Web server will need to supply a username and password first. This could always be removed at deployment time.\nAssuming you are using Apache... edit your Apache config file to make sure that any AuthConfig directives you add will work. Within the 'Directory' directive that specifies your document root, make sure you have AuthConfig in your AllowOverride statement:\nAllowOverride AuthConfig\n\nOr, you could use \"All\":\nAllowOverride All\n\nThis lets us put Apache directives in .htaccess files. Now create a password file somewhere outside the public portion of the Web site. Here I create (-c) a password file named passwords in /usr/local/etc/apache/ with the initial user, my_username. It will prompt for password.\nsudo mkdir -p /usr/local/etc/apache/\nsudo htpasswd -c /usr/local/etc/apache/passwords my_username\n\nThen put some Apache AuthConfig directives in the document root. If the document root is /var/www/, then use your favorite editor to create a new file name .htaccess...\nsudo vim /var/www/.htaccess\n\nThe contents of that file ...\nAuthType Basic\nAuthName \"My Web App\"\nAuthUserFile /usr/local/etc/apache/passwords\nRequire user my_username\n\nSave. Change owner and permissions, if running as www-data:\nsudo chown www-data /var/www/.htaccess\nsudo chmod 400 /var/www/.htaccess\n\nNow no one can use the Web server without username and password, plus the Web server cannot read your personal files. I do not know how or if this password method could work, though, when PayPal is redirecting back to you.\nI suppose you could move the .htaccess in and out of the /var/www directory as needed while you are developing the PayPal return portion of your Web app.\n\nA: I think it is better to understand the implications of port forwarding.\nNormally your router is acting as a firewall, and normally it will block all NEW connections attempting to access your server, in your case apache.\nSo if you do NOT forward port 80 from your router to your local web server, it can only be accessed from internal, from other users on your LAN.\nWhen you forward port 80 and register a FQDN, others, from outside your LAN can now access your server as well.\nFQDN = Fully Qualified Domain Name , in your case = your .tk name.\nThis has benefits, you can run your mail server and share your personal files, it also exposes your server to crackers.\nSo yes, it is a (potential) security hole. You should look at securing apache and monitor the logs for suspicious activity.\nI would not be overly paranoid, but I would not port forward without understanding how to secure your mail server and apache and learning to watch the logs (it takes a little time just to understand what is \"normal\" activity in the logs).\nWork you way through the security documentation on Apache , don't feel overwhelmed, it is a ton of information, but do not ignore it either.\nIn general the need to secure a web server is proportional to the value of the data on the server, so you are not as big a target as say a financial institution.\n", "Q: How can I configure 2 video cards to use on 3 monitors?

So, my access to Ubuntu installation is lost on the HDD. How do I restore the multiboot function to return to Ubuntu? Thanks a lot \n\nA: You have probably overwritten your bootsector. Try to use the Supergrubdisk. If that for some reason does not work, you can try the guide from the german ubuntu users wiki:\nhttp://wiki.ubuntuusers.de/GRUB#Methode-2-root-directory-Variante\nStart from a Ubuntu installation CD (or any other linux that runs from CD like knoppix). Then mount your Ubuntu root partition from the HDD to some folder, for instance /mnt. If you have a separate /usr, /boot or /etc partition, please mount it in the corresponding subfolder of the root parition (so if root is mounted at /mnt, then boot should be at /mnt/boot and so on). When finished, you can simply \"sudo grub-install --root-directory=/mnt /dev/sda\" (of course only if your hdd is sda). \nIf the last step doesn't work, because your installation is too outdated, you should still be able to use the chroot-method also given at ubuntuusers.de: Mount the root and boot partition as written above and bind the /dev directory so that you also have it available within the mounted root partition (assuming the root partition is mounted at /mnt):\nsudo mount -o bind /dev /mnt/dev \n\nSame for /sys and /proc\nsudo mount -o bind /sys /mnt/sys \nsudo mount -t proc /proc /mnt/proc \n\nNow you can chroot \nsudo chroot /mnt /bin/bash \n\nAnd you should be ready to run \"grub-install /dev/sda\".

I've also had no problem to get the printer function of my Brother DCP-135C working with no problem. I just can't get the scanner to work. \nI've tried the unsware here but that did nothing. The tricky thing is, if I call the scannig program as administrator (sudo simple-scan) it works fine, but I can't get it to work as a normal user.\n\nA: You may need to edit your /lib/udev/rules.d/40-libsane.rules file. For scan acess by a normal user in 11.10 add the following lines:\n# Brother scanners\nATTRS{idVendor}==\"04f9\", ENV{libsane_matched}=\"yes\"\n\nSee also Brother FAQ for other distributions and Ubuntu versions.\n\nA: The first thing you need to do is to copy files from /usr/lib64/ to /usr/lib/. That's because you are using 64-bit system and the drivers are 32-bit (for exact instructions refer to the Brother FAQ). This step is just for the 64-bit Ubuntu.\nThen edit your /lib/udev/rules.d/50-udev-default.rules file. You need root access to do that:\nsudo gedit /lib/udev/rules.d/50-udev-default.rules\n\nSearch for # libusb device nodes section and add by the end of it this line:\nATTRS{idVendor}==\"04f9\", ATTRS{idProduct}==\"01ce\", MODE=\"0666\", GROUP=\"scanner\", ENV{libsane_matched}=\"yes\"\n\nYou can find the idVendor and idProduct numbers by running lsusb command:\nBus 002 Device 004: ID 04f9:01ce Brother Industries, Ltd DCP-135C\n\nThere is also other way mentioned in the Brother FAQ it involves modification of other file /lib/udev/rules.d/40-libsane.rules and it's recommended for this versions of Ubuntu 9.10, 10.04, 10.10, 11.4, 11.10 (probably also 12.04). Both of these methods should work.\nYou should also add saned to the group which owns your scanner device:\nsudo adduser saned lp\n\nYour scanner is definitely in that group (I own one). If you wanted to use other scanner device then Ubuntu has documentation for it ScanningHowTo (look at Permission issues section).\nWhen you are done with all these steps you should restart the computer. The scanner should work in both Simple Scan and XSane programs.\n", "Q: Verify if crontab works I want to verify if a certain crontab works properly. I have added a job like this:\n  */2 * * * * /path_to_my_php_script/info.php >/dev/null 2>&1\n\nI know that i redirect to the null device, but i not sure if the above command is good.\n*Edit 1: In my /var/log/syslog every two minutes i have the following error:\n (CRON) error (grandchild #2788 failed with exit status 2)\n\n*Edit 2: No errors in logs with this new job:\n */2 * * * * /usr/bin/php /path_to_my_php_script/info.php >/dev/null 2>&1\n\n\nA: The syntax for the crontab entry looks correct. Indeed, if you edit your crontab using \"crontab -e\" (as you should), you'll get an error if you specify a syntactically invalid crontab entry anyway.\n\n\n*\n\n*Firstly, does /path_to_my_php_script/info.php run correctly from the command-line?\n\n*If so, does it also run correctly like this?:\n/bin/sh -c \"(export PATH=/usr/bin:/bin; /path_to_my_php_script/info.php </dev/null)\"\n\n\n*If that works, does it work like this?\n/bin/sh -c \"(export PATH=/usr/bin:/bin; /path_to_my_php_script/info.php </dev/null >/dev/null 2>&1)\"\n\nStep (3) is similar to how cron will run your program (as documented in \"man 5 cron\".\nThe most likely problem you're having is that the PATH cron is using to run your program is too restrictive. Therefore, you may wish to add something like the following to the top of your crontab entry (you'll need to add in whatever directories your script will need):\nPATH=~/bin:/usr/bin/:/bin\n\nAlso note that cron will by default use /bin/sh, not bash. If you need bash, also add this to the start of your crontab file:\nSHELL=/bin/bash\n\nNote that both those changes will affect all the crontab entries. If you just want to modify these values for your info.php program, you could do something like this:\n*/2 * * * * /bin/bash -c \". ~/.bashrc; /path_to_my_php_script/info.php\"\n\nIt's also worth mentioning that on a system configured for \"mail\" (in other words a system which has an MTA configured [sendmail/postfix/etc]), all output from crontab programs is sent to you via email automatically. A default Ubuntu desktop system won't have local mail configured, but if you're working on a server you can just type \"mail\" in a terminal to see all those cron mails. This also applies to the \"at\" command.\n\nA: Do not redirect error output to /dev/null and grep /var/log/syslog for cron output.\ngrep cron /var/log/syslog\n\nYou can immediately show errors when saving a file after editing /etc/crontab or files inside /etc/cron.d/ with: \ntail -f /var/log/syslog | grep --line-buffered cron\n\nIf the edit is ok, you will only see the RELOAD notice, errors will occur like\nJul 9 09:39:01 vm cron[1129]: Error: bad day-of-month; while reading /etc/cron.d/new \n\n\nA: I believe you can also use run-parts to run cron jobs out of band. It is actually what cron uses itself to run the periodic cron jobs, so by supplying the appropriate arguments you can run them at any time.\nIf you just want to run one file instead of all the cron jobs defined in eg /etc/cron.daily you will have to supply the regex argument along with a valid regex. run-parts --list --regex '^p.*d$' /etc\nKeep in mind that cron jobs are typically named without an extension and marked as executable, so make sure your scripts are similar, though using a regex may allow you to trigger a script with an extension.\n\nA: You can see your active cron with the terminal command:\ncrontab -l\n\nHere are the parameters in order:\n\n\n*\n\n*min (0 - 59)\n\n*hour (0 - 23)\n\n*day of month (1 - 31)\n\n*month (1 - 12)\n\n*day of week (0 - 6) (Sunday=0)\n\n*command\nSo, you are calling your script every first minute of each hour. You should test your output at a more often interval for testing purpose:\n* * * * * <command> #Runs every minute\n\nThis will call it every minute!\n\nA: Old question and many complicated answers. The easiest way is to add this line to your crontab\n* * * * * /bin/bash -l -c 'date > ~/cron-test.txt'\n\nIt will simply every minute write the current date to the file ~/cron-test.txt\nThen you just run cat ~/cron-test.txt and check if the shown date is the current date. If it is crontab is working correctly.\n\nA: Although very rare, sometimes cron stops working properly even though the service is running. Here is how to verify that crond is running and stop/start the service.\nUsing systemctl:\nsystemctl status cron\nsystemctl restart cron\n\nOlder methods:\nOn CentOS and other Red Hat-based systems:\nservice crond status\nservice crond stop\nservice crond start\n\nOn Ubuntu and other Debian-based systems:\nservice cron status\nservice cron stop\nservice cron start\n\n\nA: For the time part on each line, you can use this cron tester to test/verify your cron time definition.\n\nA: ah !!\ngot the answer myself, I checked and did not find crond inside the default installation directory i.e /etc/init.d/\nwill now try and reply.\nnote -- I did check the cron.allow, cron.deny too. All is fine so far.\n", "Q: Can't select Lucida Sans Typewriter as font for Konsole I have Lucida Sans Typewriter font installed in my KDE and I can easily use it as text font in my Eclipse.

Although I have read about all the uses of linux and stuff, and I am an experienced web developer, I somehow feel that the UI is a big let down.\nIn version 11.10 - the only linux/ubuntu I have used so far - the 'task bar' over the left side seems too clunky. And something else that is irritating is the notifications that appear, for example when a new mail arrives, there is a semi transparent message displayed over the top right of the screen, and this thing is displayed for nearly 5 secs with no option to close it manually, as a result it blocks that much of the screen for couple of seconds. I went to see the screenshots of various other distros, and found openSuse to be slick and friendly though I have not used it. \nCould you please let me know - \na) for a newbie, not looking into too advanced features of linux, how openSuse fares with ubuntu - in terms of UI friendliness.\nb) should i tryout a previous version of ubuntu, say v10.. does v10 also have such issues? how does v10 compare with v11 over user friendliness?\nAs i said, i am new to linux, maybe there are features that let me change all these issues and customise as per my liking, but as of now i have no idea as to how to go about with it. Appreciate it if you could guide me to resources on that, if available.\nthanks!\n\nA: I don't really know what answer you are looking for, if this is even a question. There are about fifty different taskbars available in Ubuntu. You don't have to replace the operating system in order to use other programs, and the desktop is just a program like any other. Indeed Ubuntu has all the desktops that all other GNU/Linux distros provide. \nThe notifications doesn't have to be closed. It is just a notification. You don't have to do anything with it, and you don't have to close it. It does not block anything. If you move the mouse pointer on top of it, it becomes more transparent so that it doesn't block the view. If you click, the click is handled as if the notification was not there at all. \nYou ask for a recommendation, but you don't say anything about what you want. «I don't like Ford Fiesta. Which car should I buy?» Difficult question. Perhaps you might want to try KDE? You can install it in Ubuntu by installing the kubuntu-desktop package. It's in the archives, so you can just click the link to install it. \nIn the future, you should say what it is you want and not what you don't want, and if you do say what you don't want, you should say why. \n\nA: There really isn't a definitive answer to your questions, it's highly subjective and depends a lot on your tastes and how you like to work.\na) In my opinion, openSuse isn't quite as user friendly as Ubuntu, but I've spent much more time with the latter than the former. Compared with Ubuntu 11.10 however, OpenSuse is probably a little more like other distros than Ubuntu, which might result in less wasted efort should you hop top another distro.\nb) If you're going to go back, you could go back to 10.04, the LTS version, which has it's own advantages, and doesn't have the unity interface and menus.\nThere are also ways to use Ubuntu 11.10 with other desktops/interfaces, if you want to go down that route a quick google search will bring up plenty of results.\n\nA: Welcome to askubuntu!\noperating system:\nit is an opinion, not a fact!\nfor a new user of linux, UBUNTU is the most user friendly distro for you. so i suggest you go with ubuntu or an ubuntu derivative at the moment for lot of reasons:\n\n*\n\n*easy to install and manage and good community and support. (ubuntu\nforums and askubuntu).\n\n*easy to get codecs and other stuff\n\n*the .DEB packages are more common than .rpm packages used in opensuse\nand fedora.\n\nHowever, linux is about choice, and in fact if you choose ubuntu, you have a lot of Desktop environments to choose from, which can change the feel of your ubuntu desktop, gaining customization and maintaining the benefits of ubuntu.\nDesktop environments\nyou can try:\n\n*\n\n*unity: the default ubuntu DE. (shell above gnome 3)\n\n*gnome shell: you can install the package by openning a terminal, and\ntype the command: sudo apt-get gnome-shell  .or by going to the software center, search for gnome shell and install it. then log out and\nchoose GNOME and enter your password.\n\n*KDE: you can install it by typing in terminal sudo apt-get kubuntu-desktop, or by going to the software center and search for\nkubuntu desktop and install it.\n\n*XFCE: you can install it by typing in terminal  sudo apt-get xubuntu-desktop  or search for xubuntu desktop in the software\ncenter.\n\nyou can change the desktop enviroment by selecting your choice in the login screen (the wheel of options).\nso my suggestion is to try all of these DE's for a week or two. and find out which you like the most. and then if you like KDE you can full install kubuntu distro instead. or if you like XFCE you can re install the whole system using Xubuntu distro. and if you like unity or gnome shell, you can keep the ubuntu install you have with both of them on, like i do.  :)\nyou can search more info about each one here in askubuntu. how to customize, and how to reach and do things.\n\n*\n\n*unity: you can mainly customize it by installing ccsm (compiz\nmanager), and customize the plugins in there. lot of stuff.\n\n*gnome shell: you can customize it mainly by extensions. take a look\nat this site (alpha), or go here or there to get it going.\n\n*KDE and XFCE are mainly customizable per se. feel free to discover\nthem well.\n\ngood luck\n", "Q: Missing the empathy menu after upgrade to 11.10 Since I have upgraded to 11.10 the menu in empathy is gone.\nAfter clicking on Chat the Contact List window opens.

But how to add new buddys then?\nUpdate: I have played with Compiz Config Settings and now the menu for Empathy works.

When I try to install a 64-bit Windows 7 guest I get the following error: \n\nAttempting to load 64 bit however this CPU is not compatible with 64 bit mode. \n\n\nMy host is Ubuntu 64-bit, how is it not compatible?\n\nA: You are not installing Windows 7 on Ubuntu as a software, you are installing inside VirtualBox. \nEnable the virtualization setting inside your computer BIOS. After that, you may install 64 Bit Windows 7 inside VirtualBox.\n\nA: I've read a couple of the answers here and on other threads. What did it for me was to enable virtualization in BIOS like most are saying.\nHowever, for some reason, to get it to work, I also had to delete my Windows 7 virtual machine and create a new one (still with the same settings).\n\nA: Probably while creating the new virtual computer you did not select Windows7 64bit. Create a new one and make sure that you have selected Windows 7(64 bit) from the drop down box.\n\nIt can also be that virtualization is not active in your computer or that your simply does not support it, to check if you system supports virtualization run this command\ngrep ^flags /proc/cpuinfo | head -n1 | egrep --color=auto ' (vmx|svm) '\n\nand look for vmx or svm, if any of those shows up your system supports it.\nIf it does and you have selected the right template for the virtual guest then probably your BIOS has it disabled.\nHave a look in your BIOS options or drop a comment in your question mentioning which computer model / motherboard you have.\n\nA: Turn off Hyper Threading (HT) technology in the BIOS setting and VirtualBox will install any x64 OS without any VT-X pop ups as well. Worked for me on a x64 intel i5 machine.\n\nA: check your processor specs. find out if supported of virtualization then if supported enable in cmos.You can now install virtualbox.\n", "Q: Simple rhythmbox plugins do not work - why? Simple Rhythmbox plugins do not work in 11.10. Does anybody know why?

As the described solution add the icon application to the Dash Unity panel, it fails to display the icon on the application itself in /usr/share/applications.\nYou only need to add the icon (with the name declared in the Desktop Entry) in the /usr/share/pixmaps/ directory. This is the directory where all applications put their icons.

I'm going to install Ubuntu on my other PC, but the thing is that after installing Ubuntu it's going to update more than 208 MB and I don't want to update 208 MB after installation.\nIs there any way that I can download an already-updated Ubuntu 11.10 ISO?\n\nA: Only the LTS releases get point release updates, so no, you can't get an already updated 11.10 image.\n\nA: https://wiki.ubuntu.com/OfflineUpdateSpec\nfollow this link to reach a web page describing 3 main options available for solving your problem.\n\nA: My preference would be to use AptonCd as described in the link above. You would need to build your \"master\" system with the packages and updates that you want. You would then use AptonCd to create a backup of your packages and save them to some storage medium. You would then use the 11.10 ISO to install the base version of Oneric and then install AptOnCD and do a restore from the backup that you made. Packages should be restored to /var/cache/apt/archives. You would then need to run:\nsudo dpkg -i /var/cache/apt/archives/*.deb\nTake a nice Starbucks break and then come back in an hour or two and it should be done. \n\nA: There are three options to download the packages only once:\n1) Use the 11.10 CD and refuse to update. This will give you 11.10 pre-updates, and is best if your network connection is slow or flaky.\n2) Use a pre-release 12.04 build. This is not recommended if you are unwilling to put up with the very likely breakage in pre-release software.\n3) Use the Minimal Install ( https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Installation/MinimalCD ) or NetInstall 11.10 options. This will give you a current 11.10, and will reduce your total download considerably, though the total install time may not be shorter. You need a reliable network connection for this to work.\n", "Q: What script should I use to remove apps not related to Eclipse development, without disturbing GUI functionality?

I am new to Ubuntu and I wanted to write a website on it. I am used to Windows XP and I am used to writing the display image code as follows:\nimg src=\"C:\\Users\\Username\\My Pictures\\Test.jpg\" alt=\"Picture\"\n\nIn Ubuntu they do not have drive letters, what should i do? My picture is in a separate partition named Documents and under the file properties it says the directory is:\n/media/Documents/Files/Micah/Homepage Website/Picture.jpg \n\nHowever when i write it into html it just displays picture in normal text! Any help?\n\nA: Permissions might hinder you. The entire path to the image must be readable by the Web server. If you are using Apache running as the www-data user, then your directories should probably be set to 0755 (drwxr-xr-x), and the files, 0644 (-rw-r--r--). You can see the permissions in a console/shell with something like this:\ncd /media\nls -l\n\nYou can change permissions with something like this:\nsudo chmod 0755 directory_name\nsudo chmod 0644 file_name\n\nDo that for each directory and all the files you want to access. Or, in two swipes, one for directories, one for files, get them all without picking though each dir/file:\nsudo find /media -type d -exec chmod 0755 {} \\;\nsudo find /media -type f -exec chmod 0644 {} \\;\n\nWhen you know the permissions are correct, you would benefit by creating a symbolic link to the directory instead of trying to reference them all by absolute file system path. Change directories to the website document root. Let's say this is /home/micah/public_html/.\ncd /home/micah/public_html/\nln -s /media/Documents/Files/Micah/Homepage\\ Website/ images\n\nNow you have a symbolic link, like a virtual directory, to the location of the images.\nIn order for this to work, Apache needs to know that it is allowed to follow the sybmolic link. So, in your Apache config file, where you have defined your website, look in the 'Directory' directive to make sure you have specified the \"FollowSymLinks\" option.\n<Directory />\n    Options FollowSymLinks\n</Directory>\n\nRestart the Web server after this.\nsudo service apache2 restart\n\nThen, the XHTML is this:\n<img src=\"/images/Picture.jpg\" width=\"\" height=\"\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" />\n\nBy the way, when you have spaces in a URI, and for each blank space, substitute the HTML character entity, %20.\nIf you are just creating HTML files, ignore the Apache part.\n\nA: So did you try <img src=\"/media/Documents/Files/Micah/Homepage Website/Picture.jpg\">?\n\nA: As I see in your code, your picture has a space in one of its folders:\n/Homepage Website/Picture.jpg \nUsually, that's not a good idea. Try putting an underscore:\n/Homepage_Website/Picture\nIt's also a good practice to put filenames in lowerscore: \"picture\" instead of \"Picture\". \nThat can turn into problems sometimes. \n\nA: Although you are using Ubuntu this is more properly a HTML question. Remember, the web browser will look first in the folder that the file is in that it is opening. So, if your opening page is index.html (web browsers look for that name as standard) and the image is in the same folder, then the brower will load Picture.jpg with the width and height set for it.\nSuch has\n<img src=\"Picture.jpg\" width=\"1000px\" height=\"200px\">\n\nI use this method to set a background image to a kind of ebook that I am creating for my personal use where I use a web browser to access the documents.\nYou can use \"../filename\" to get to a file in the previous folder. I use that to return to the previous page and to reference the CSS stylesheet that is being used. You need that reference in every document.\n<link rel=\"stylesheet\" type=\"text/css\" href=\"../stylesheetname.css\" />\n\nif the stylesheet is one folder backwards.\nI am trying to find an example from my work of referencing a file in another folder so that you can put all your images in a Images folder. But it is awhile that I did any work on this project. I will give you this for now.\nEdit: It seems that you simply do this:\n<img src=\"/images/Picture.jpg\" width=\"1000px\" height=\"200px\">\n\nOr this:\n<img src=\"/images/moreimages/Picture.jpg\" width=\"1000px\" height=\"200px\">\n\nYou might find this W3Schools for HTML tutorials useful\nRegards.\n", "Q: Ubuntu One Is there a portable version?

It came after a friend of mine clicked the \"close computer\" button (the button you also turn the computer on with) on the keyboard and then he clicked \"turn off/shut down\" in the menu that popped - which shouldn't do anything, and this was exactly what he did. Then when I wanted to turn on the computer again I should choose between some system layouts, which I think it was. I chose the most top and from that time on the appearance of files are awful. I don't know how to get back to that menu to switch system layout - been browsing the net for ages and tried closing the computer down like my friend did - nothing works. \nAnyone have an idea what to do?\n\n\nA: It sounds like you are getting bumped back to some (ugly) default settings, probably because of some settings manager not working. You could try running in a terminal killall gnome-settings-daemon, then gnome-settings-daemon&. (You should be fine to close the terminal, even if it is still giving you more messages. The gnome-settings-daemon program should continue to run, and hopefully your theme will automatically be applied).\n\nA: its a theme issue, switch your theme to Ubuntu defaults first.

The problem:\nSeries upload of 100 or more files via FTP is interrupted. Behavior irregular. \nOn a new PC from 2011, Ubuntu just installed. No other problem with Ubuntu. Fast browser action and Website loading.  \nQUESTION \nWhat could I try, in addition to the steps described here below?\nOr is there a primitive error or a primitive solution? \nOriginal text not modified. Updates done by adding:\n\n\n*\n\n*Dec.7, 2011: Information added below in 3.2)\n\n*Dec.9,2011: added:  4.d)   4.e) \n\n*Dec.10,2011: added  4.f)\n\n\n2. More facts:\nFTP upload of several 1000 files (several sites) is here done by own Perl programs which send a series of FTP standard commands to the standard ftp of the LINUX system. \nEffect: Similar to mirroring - but enables fine-tuning.\nThe used single commands \"ftp mput\" comprise e.g. 100 files, each file approx. 100 KB. \nApprox. 1000 files per Website. \nUploading to: Websites using shared hosting. The servers use Linux, e.g. Bluehost=Hostmonster or Lunarpages. \n3.1) So far I never had such a problem.\nDuring years I never had such a problem with Fedora. Fedora 13 on a PC from 2006 continues to do the job even now properly (idential DSL connection, identical DSL hardware). \nI intentionally did not upgrade Fedora 13. So LINUX ftp might have changed a bit in the meantime. But it is not probable that this is the reason.  \nPCs are here only used as OS supplier. Data and own software are on an external HD, are OS-independent and portable (organized by Perl software).  \nThe new UBUNTU PC does not do this job perfectly, while working on the identical external HD and with an identical software environment. \n(Only the network cable differs, but this should not cause any problem. 1 m length for the old FEDORA PC, 5 m for the new Ubuntu PC.)  \n3.2) UBUNTU specifics cause probably the problem (added Dec.7,2011)\nIn the meantime / now I have : \nUBUNTU 64b from late 2011 on the new PC / 2011, SATA hard disks.\nUBUNTU 32b from late 2011 on the old PC / 2006, PATA (/IDE) hard disks.\nThese are just suppliers of the operating system. All data, software and execution is done on an external HD which is IDENTICAL for both cases.  \nIn both cases, the described problem occurs. It does NOT occur for the old PC when run with Fedora 13 (from 2009 or so). \nThe problem is hence very probably somehow correlated to specific features of UBUNTU. \nThere is a very low probability that since FEDORA 13 the general LINUX system has changed, resulting in this problem. \nWith a rapid Google search, so far I did not find any information about similar problems. \nEverything else of UBUNTU is working fine on the new PC with a wide screen. \nSo it is from now for a while here the choice.\nI am getting these weeks a 10 times faster DSL Internet connection. Perhaps the problem will then disappear. (I suppose it will NOT disappear.) \n4.a)  Priority setting does not help.\nWith the command   nice    I have tested a priority of -18\n(verified in gnome-system-monotor - yes, -18). \nThis did not help. \n4.b)  sudo  use did not help\nI also tried to call the Perl program which does the job, with sudo. \nThis did not influence the result. \n4.c)  Behaviour irregular\nThere is no rule at what point of time (which file) the upload is stopped. \nNormally after some minutes - only once it did the whole job of 2 hours. \nThere is perhaps a minor correlation to the rush hours of Internet use. But this is not sure. \n4.d) No help from: source code, -i flag, -v flag (added 9 Dec.2011)\nThe involved COMPLETE long Perl programs would not be helpful here. (Various features, sites, specifics,...). \nHere the OWN command (Perl subroutine) with the upload problem (example):\n&FTP_c_mput (\" www/ppp-de/*.htm\") \nThis simply does the FTP command :  mput  www/ppp-de/*.htm\nfor ~200 files, but (the problem:) halts at file 30 or so\n-i  All is automatic - hence already with -i flag, hence nothing interactive. \nSo a timeout error should normally never occur. \n-v --- Always in verbose mode (therefore the results in nr.5.2. and 5.3.)\nI still have to implement within the software the debug function   -d  (like recommended).  It is doubful that it will help - because...: \n4.e) Most probable problem reason - I suppose (added Dec 9,2011)\nMost probable is that some process, specific to Ubuntu, creates a delay - so that the ftp program does not supply fast enough the next file to the remote PC (Internet server). But I did not state delays of several seconds for any other function. Everything works perfect and fast. And I could not find any correlation of some software action or so before the problem occurrence. \nI state per,anently a short hard disk access every 3 seconds (if the control led is acting properly). Every 3 seconds - or faster. Not regular. This may have simple explanations. This even continues when there is no application running - a totally blank monitor. But I do not believe that the reason is related to this.  \n4.f) Debug feature? ftp -d  (added Dec.10,2011)\nThe -d flag for ftp : Not tried (while recommended by a comment).  \nThe -d flag as such is not sufficient. To get ftp logged, various steps are required (rsyslog.conf...). The probability that this time investment would lead to success, is for this problem type close to zero. \nSo I will instead continue the work-around: Doing bulk uploading on Fedora (= PC 1), all the rest on Ubuntu (= PC2), and try other steps to find in some future the solution.\n5.1. Example:  This is a control display during uploads\nThis display is done by my own Perl programs, hence not by FTP. Shortened. May include 100...300 files.\nwww/xmed-ppp-de/index.htm www/xmed-ppp-de/wweb-pare-med-de.htm www/xmed-ppp-de/wwee-fina-med-de.htm www/xmed-ppp-de/wwfu-cont-med-de.htm www/xmed-ppp-de/wwfu-sepa-med-de.htm \n5.2. Example: The standard display of the ftp program is like:\n150 Connecting to port 63555\n#...\n226-File successfully transferred\n226 7.126 seconds (measured here), 10.14 Kbytes per second\n73985 bytes sent in 0.81 secs (89.7 kB/s)\nlocal: www/xmed-ppp-de/wyck-tob-bo-med-de.htm remote: www/xmed-ppp-de/wyck-tob-bo-med-de.htm\n200 PORT command successful\n5.3. Example: The display when interrupted:\nWith new installed UBUNTU on a new PC, the series is ending mostly after approx. 30 files, varying in random manner between 20 und 50, with the following error message: \n- hence:  a Timeout error for MY typing - but it was the FTP bulk command mput , \n-  so there can not really be a typing speed problem on MY PC...\n150 Connecting to port 63562\n#...\n226-File successfully transferred\n226 10.317 seconds (measured here), 14.02 Kbytes per second\n148068 bytes sent in 6.65 secs (21.8 kB/s)\nlocal: www/xmed-ppp-de/wyck-tob-ris-med-de.htm remote: www/xmed-ppp-de/wyck-tob-ris-med-de.htm\n200 PORT command successful\n421 Timeout - try typing a little faster next time\nlocal: www/xmed-ppp-de/wyck-tob-sto-med-de.htm remote: www/xmed-ppp-de/wyck-tob-sto-med-de.htm\nNo control connection for command: Success\nlocal: www/xmed-ppp-de/wycu-nut-med-de.htm remote: www/xmed-ppp-de/wycu-nut-med-de.htm\n............... etc. etc. for all following files ............\n\nA: (Here is my own answer for my own question above.) \nThe solution is:\nThe problem does not any more occur when using a faster Internet connection. \nIt occured for a speed of 0.2 Mb/sec (past DSL standard speed for uploads - level like in 2005,2006; not measured). \nIt does not any more occur for a speed of 1.2 Mb/sec or similar (current upload speed, via mobile Internet access UMTS, measured with http://www.umts-speedtest.com ) \nIn case of reduced speed with this mobile access form (UMTS), the problem occurs again. This may happen during the daily rush hours of the mobile access network to the Internet.\nThe speed here will during the next weeks increase to 5 Mb/sec (upload, 25 or 50 for downloads). So this will probably settle the problem in a definite manner. \nNow we have a good definition for the problem reason:\nThis problem type only occurs for the used UBUNTU distribution DVD / late 2011 (but probably for all current UBUNTU distributions). \nIt does never occur for Fedora Core, at least up to version 13=2009. Later versions have not yet been checked. It is supposed that later and current (2011,2012) versions of Fedora Core will also not have this problem. \nThe problem is not very important. It is unusual that such bulk upload jobs are done for users with slow upload speeds like typical for 2005 or so. \nBug removal : Is there a bug?\nFTP utility programs probably do bulk uploads in a different manner and will therefore probably not be affected. The problem will probably only occur if bulk uploads are done by using for 30++ files the basic FTP command: mput\nThis command should work for all upload speeds - also for modems with a telephone landline - and for all file quantities. \nSo is there a bug? - Probably just in the sense of some default initial configuration. The process priority setting did not settle the problem. But it might be that the problem is related to computing priorities for the high level graphics features of current Ubuntu (I learned to like them...). \nPerhaps this FTP problem does not matter. Before placing this question on this site, I had looked up via Google I did not find somebody else communicating the same problem type. \nOther possible reason?\nSome other totally different reason might be: Instability of Internet connections, due to current local changes here, \nand with some higher vulnerability from this for the configuration of UBUNTU (from late 2011) than that for Fedora Core (from 2009). \nSo let us forget about it... \n", "Q: Unable to boot into Ubuntu after fresh installation In my laptop (Lenovo Ideapad v570), which came with 750GB HDD with 4 NTFS primary partitions I installed ubuntu by following these steps\nThe 4 partions were, 1.(650GB)Windows7  2.

Does this warning has anything to do with the problem?\n\nA: I have encountered the misaligned partition warning before and it never effected the system booting.  More than likely the reason your system is booting straight into Windows 7 and not prompting you is because Ubuntu wasn't added to the MBR.  If you are comfortable editing your MBR then log into Windows and do so.  If you are not that comfortable doing so, I would suggest a program called EasyBCD.  EasyBCD is a program that gives you a GUI to edit your MBR, and it is incredibly easy to use.\nHere is a link to EasyBCD: http://download.cnet.com/EasyBCD/3000-2094_4-10556865.html?tag=mncol;1\n\nA: I had the same problem.

Anyway, I can view the calendar and highlight a specific day but that's it.  It's not a shortcut to any calendar that you could do scheduling or anything. Am I missing some functions or is the extent of this calendars interactivity? If the calendar is really just for display, how do I change that to make it actually function with say, Google calendar?\n\nA: I would suggest installing evolution. You can do this by typing \"sudo apt-get install evolution\" (Without the \"\")\nYou can import your Gmail calendar then.

On AskUbuntu, I've seen a few commands around that look quite complicated, with lots of symbols in them. To get a better understanding of how these commands are built up, I'd like to know what the symbols stand for.\nFor example:\nfind ~/ -name \\*.c -exec sed -i \"s/cybernetnews/cybernet/g\" {} \\;\nor even more complicated:\necho -e \"\\e[${i#*=}m$( x=${i%=*}; [ \"${!x}\" ] && echo \"${!x}\" || echo \"$x\" )\\e[m\"\nI understand very well that adding parameters as -c, --debug, have certain effects on the main commmand. The meanings of these are in almost all cases to be found in the man pages, so that's not really what I'm looking for.\nPlease, try in your answer to define what the symbols specifically do, instead of explaining the examples I gave. That could look like this:\n\" means 'argument': the main command uses anything within these symbols as its source\n^ is used for ...\n# is used for ...\n\nThanks in advance\n\nA: Unfortunately you do have to go to the man pages, as the \"symbols\" may have different meanings depending on which command is reading them.\nFor instance, in your first command, the meaning of {} and \\; depend on the find command (man find). The meaning of quotes on an argument to sed are dependent on either sed or bash (as it's a quoted parameter it can potentially be a shell thing). The ~/ is definitely a bash pattern expansion thing.\nFor the second complicated command, it's mostly echoing stuff, so you'll find most information on that in bash's man page.\nTo answer your comment to this, the redirection characters > < | are used to pipe stuff from, and into, files (the greater and lesser than signs), and to connect a command's output with another's input (the pipe |). See here for a nice tutorial on I/O redirection, this is a very powerful design feature of the Unix shell and toolset.\n\nA: 1st one searches for files ending on .c from within directory ~/ and executes sed (streamline editor) where sed searches  for cybernetnews and changes it into cybernet. \nThe 2nd one eludes me ... shows an empty result when executed.\n\nA: The best resource I've found for learning terminal commands is LinuxCommand, it gives detailed descriptions of the most used commands available.\n\nA: It is hard to tell you the full meaning of the symbols as you are pasting complex commands.\nThe echo in particular.\nSee man echo for the -e , it enables escape , so lateer \\e is an escape.\nThe majority of the other symbols are string manipulations.\nSo imagine you have a variable, i which contains a string \"foo\"\ni=foo;echo $i\nfoo\n\nBut it becomes more complex if your variable, $i, is also a part of a string\necho $ibar # Note: no output\n\necho ${i}bar # we have output\nfoobar\n\nNow you can manipulate the strings as well, print only a part\nIn your case\n${i#*=} = print $i , Strip out shortest match between * and = , but * itself is a wildcard ..\necho ${i#o}\nfoo\n\necho ${i#*o}\no\n\nSee http://tldp.org/LDP/abs/html/string-manipulation.html\nNext we hit a sub shell ( x ... )\nBash will process the commands in the sub shell and return the output of the commands.\nx = (a sub string of i )\n; continue\nNow we have a test , [ \"${!x}\" ]\nSee : http://tldp.org/LDP/abs/html/testconstructs.html\nAnd here is where I can tell you no more.\nIn bash, ${!x} is going to be an empty string.\n&& == logical and || is logical or\ntest {empty string} AND echo empty string or echo x\nYou would need to give more syntax, but it appears this echo is piping it's output somewhere.\nAgain [ ] is a test, and we escaped a [ at the very beginning.\nSo I can only explain so much of what the echo is doing.\nThe reason why there is no output when you enter the echo command in a terminal is it is a snipit of code, by default neither x or i is defined, so all the output is empty. \n\nA: See The Bash Reference Manual section called Shell-Operation and the Advanced Bash-Scripting Guide Chapter 3 (Special Characters).\nI refer to those anytime I need to learn something new about shell scripting in ubuntu/linux.\nI think you will find ABS Chapter 3 the easiest to navigate for your purposes. All the symbols are seen on the far left of the page with a description immediately below them.\n\nA: For questions about symbols in specific languages, you might want to try SymbolHound.

I generally avoid the hosted Ruby repos and install RVM manually but I notice there's an RVM repo in Ubuntu Software Center now. Has anyone used it? Would I be better off continuing to install RVM manually?\nI expect that, like RVM, it installs into the home directory as opposed to one that requires sudo access.\n\nA: Well, I went ahead and installed ruby-rvm from ubuntu software center, and I can now advise STRONGLY against doing this. \nRVM is supposed to install to the home directory (i.e. home/stephen), but the canonical hosted version installs to /usr, which means you need to sudo before you can install gems and so on.\nI have removed ruby-rvm using apt, but am now unable to install RVM the proper way (i.e. using curl from command line) and I get an error stating that I need root privileges to write anything to /usr.

If however, you manually start them (that's why it worked after you killed Guake), this issue doesn't occur.\nSo to fix it, you can create a simple script to launch Guake with a delay. Create a file called \"guake-start.sh\" in your home folder and paste this:\n#!/bin/bash\nsleep 15 && guake\n\n\"sleep 15\" will make Guake start with a 15 seconds delay.

I made the mistake of installing Jenkins from the ubuntu package, which causes endless stress around here in update management. I have no quarrel with how Ubuntu arranged the files on disk.\nFor the curious, jenkins has an internal package manager that downloads plugin updates, and careful coordination of main jenkins installs and plugin upgrades is required to avoid chaotic conditions. So we haver to carefully block jenkins upgrades via, oh, apt-get upgrade when we don't know exactly what's going on with the plugins.\nSo, what I'd like to do is persuade dpkg / apt-get to forget that there is a jenkins package, without letting it delete any existing files.\nBy the way, the 'install' consists of one '.war' file plus the /etc/init.d links.\nObviously, I can backup up what I care about, remove the package, and restore, but I was hoping to learn that there was an obscure dpkg option that forgot to delete files.\nIs there a way?\n\nA: Still very helpful even if a hack. An added suggestion is to similarly remove the unwanted package from /var/lib/dpkg/available and to remove all of the {package}.* files from /var/lib/dpkg/info/\nI used this when I decided to install a newer version of a piece of software from source, that had previously been installed as the Ubuntu-released version.

It's too coarse (HW values are 0..15).\nHow to change the step to 1?\n\nA: One way to change the brightness to individual settings is to use your console. So open a terminal (e.g. gnome-terminal) and:\n\n\n*\n\n*Find where your system saves brightness settings: sudo find /sys /proc -name brightness. Usually they can be found in /proc/acpi/video/*/*/brightness, where * is some directory which depends on your graphics card. On my system I find the brightness settings at /sys/devices/virtual/backlight/acpi_video0/brightness.\n\n*If the find command produces no output, check if the video kernel module was loaded: lsmod | grep video should output something like video                  18612  0.\n\n*Now check what is contained in the files the find command found: cat $DIR, where $DIR is the directory from find output. Sometimes you will only find a number and sometimes some numbers (levels) and the actual setting.\n\n*Change brightness setting: echo $somenumber | sudo tee $DIR, where $somenumber is an integer and $DIR the directory from the output of find.\n\n*When the command was successful executed, you will notice a changed brightness.\n\n\nA: on my T520i, Ubuntu 12.04, it's found in /sys/devices/pci0000:00/0000:00:02.0/backlight/acpi_video0/brightness, and it changes brightness but we still need the finer step on the keyboard shortcut :(\n", "Q: Playing video on www.foxsoccer.tv does not work How can I play video through www.foxsoccer.tv?   I don't have problems with playing video, i.e. watching live events on espn, but on the foxsoccer website it just shows the loading video icon and never plays. Are there any options I can choose in Mozilla or in my operating system:  11.10?  \n\nA: I had a similar problem that may - or may not - apply to your situation.  There is a plugin for Netscape to help you find if you are using the \"best\" version of Flash for your system; it's called Flash-Aid.  You can install it following the instructions here: http://www.liberiangeek.net/2011/11/flash-aid-helps-you-install-adobe-flash-player-in-ubuntu-64-bit-32-bit/\nOnce installed, run it and accept all the defaults.  After, restart Firefox and see if it will run your site.  If not, you can uninstall the plugin easily from Firefox by choosing Tools->Add-ons from the Firefox menu.\nIn my case, I thought I had the \"best\" Flash already on my system (11.10), but there was one site in particular that I couldn't run until I used Flash-aid.  I hope it works for you, too.\n\nA: If videos show correctly in places like youtube, vimeo, espn and others and not in foxsoccer this is an issued with that site and not firefox or Ubuntu 11.10. If not then you might have a flash problem but as you stated, watching videos in espn works so am going for the foxsoccer site having an issue.\nWhat I suggest is:\n\n\n*\n\n*Check that the site does not have some sort of geolocation service that might banned or limit your country. Personally is just dumb to have something like that.\n\n*Check to see there is a maximun allowed of viewers for the video you want to watch. Bandwidth and such.\n\n*Check to see that for some specific super top secret fox soccer chance, the site asks to login, to install something additional or anything not common in video, streaming or live sites. This is just an idea in the air but some sites ask to have \"something\" installed that they use to monitor activity (Which is not even related to the actual watching of the video but anyway).\n", "Q: How to install a thesaurus in LibreOffice? How can I enable the thesaurus in LibreOffice?\n\nA: It is strange but, if you use English (UK) for your paragraph, Libreoffice does NOT use thesaurus. You check this under Tool > Options > Language Settings > Writing Aids > Modify and see that English (UK) has no thesaurus. \nIf you choose the English (USA) you can use the thesaurus. I think the problem is solved in this way.\n\nA: It isn't that LibreOffice doesn't have the Thesaurus.  It does, but for some reason it wasn't turned on when I installed mine.  \nGo to Tools > Options > Language Settings > Writing Aids > Options, make sure the top two items are checked: Check spelling as you type and Check grammar as you type.  \nAfter doing that I had the Thesaurus.  I also had Check spelling as you type, but you can disable that in the toolbar, by clicking the ABC with the red squiggly line under it.  \nTo use the Thesaurus, Ctrl+F7, or right-click on the word for which you want a synonym, hover over Synonyms.\n\nA: I fixed this problem by installing Thesaurus:\nsudo apt-get install openoffice.org-thesaurus-en-us\n\nThen selecting all the text and changing to USA:\n\nTools → Language → For All Text → select English (USA)\n\nI can now access:\n\nright-click → Synonyms   \n\n\nA: If Tools>>Language>>Thesaurus is greyed out, you need to install them first. From a terminal type the following to get English American:\nsudo apt install mythes-en-us\n\nTo see all available, type:\napt search mythes\n\n\nA: Using the standard installation of LibreOffice you don't have to install it. It is already installed. You can right click any word choosing the entry »Synonyms«. Now you will get a list of synonyms to the selected word. \nIf this does not work\n\n\n*\n\n*go to then main menu »Tool->Options«,\n\n*choose the sub menu (on the left column) »Language Settings->Writing Aids« \n\n*and then enable the option »OpenOffice.org new thesaurus« under the category »Writing Aids«.\n\n\nThat's it.\nIf this option is marked, but the thesaurus option in the tools>language menu is still grayed, then you have to perform this command using terminal:\nsudo apt-get install openoffice.org-thesaurus-en-us\n\n\nA: Using LO 3.5.3.2 on Ubuntu 10.04 the following got me going:\n(1) Tools > Options > Language Settings > +Languages:\nset 'default languages for documents to 'English (UK)' or 'English (USA)'\n(you'll notice that these two have spelling symbols next to them - not sure if this only relates to dictionaries or to thesauri as well.\n(2) Tools > Options > Language Settings > +Writing Aids:\nedit 'Available language modules' > 'OpenOffice.org New Thesaurus' and choose 'Language' to be English (UK) or (USA) as desired. \nI also downloaded and installed the thesaurus created by the weekly whinge at the same time, but perhaps you might not need to do that. At any rate, even after installing the whinger's extension I still only see 'OpenOffice.org New Thesaurus' in the writing aids dialogue.\nYou should also probably make sure all of your text in your document is set to the same language as chosen in steps above.\n\nA: Click on Tools -> Language -> For All Text -> Select English (USA).\nThis working because in Ubuntu there is thesaurus packages installed by default. In synaptic this have the name: mythes-en-us (is possible that in some distribution are not, you can install it manually)\n\nA: Trust me, it works.\nDownload and install this Libreoffice extension:\nAmerican British Canadian - spelling/hyphen/thesaurus dictionaries Libreoffice extension\nAmerican English - hyphenation, thesaurus, 638K+ word list extension worked for me. Just start Libreoffice and the thesaurus won't be grayed i.e. you can use Ctrl+F7 to open thesaurus dialog.\n\nA: \nInitially, the thesaurus uses the language of the selected word in the\n  document, if a thesaurus library for that language is installed. The\n  title bar of the Thesaurus dialog displays the language in use.\n\nYou can install languages with a thesaurus library from the Extensions web page.\nReferences and more info can be found on the LibreOffice site here. \n\nA: The same problem goes for the Australian dictionary.

I want to share two folders on my Ubuntu box for my W7 machine to use. I typed [MyFiles] only once, then a separate block entry for each path. When I testparmed, only the last path was shown.\n\nA: I assume you're talking about Samba, given you've mentioned the testparm utility.\nThe section headers in the smb.conf file represent the different shares Samba will provide.  So if you've added a [MyFiles] section, then Samba will share it as \\\\hostname\\MyFiles to Windows machines.\nEach share serves the files from a single folder, so if you want to share two different folders you will need to configure two shares in the smb.conf file (with different section names).\n", "Q: I can't do \"sudo\" Let's describe it from the beginning:\nI was planning to re-enable the password requirement in LightDM for security reasons.

Post-Increments will do it after posting it to the terminal. So you will see that the first value is the same as the assign one in the beginning for the first case.\nTo check this just do this twice:\ni=1   \n$((i++)) // The output will be 1,2\n\nAnd then check the rest twice also:\ni=1   \n$((++i)) // The output will be 2,3\n\nFor the echo $((i=i+1)) it will behave the same as a Pre-Increment in the sense that (As shown by the equation) it will assign +1 to the value of 1 and then output the result.\nJust to test out the results I made a small script to play with:\nx=1\nxx=$((x++))\n\ny=1\nyy=$((y=y+1))\n\nz=1\nzz=$((++z))\n\necho $xx \"Post-Increment\"\necho $yy \"Y+1 Sum / Same as Pre-Increment\"\necho $zz \"Pre-Increment\"\n\nif [ $xx -eq $yy ]; then\n echo \"Post-Increment X equals normal Y+1 method.. yeah right..\"\nelif [ $xx -eq $zz ]; then\n echo \"Post-Increment X equals Pre-Increment Z.. yeah sure..no problem\"\nelif [ $yy -eq $zz ]; then\n echo \"Normal Y+1 method equals Pre-Increment Z.. BINGO! You get a cookie\"\nfi\n\n\nA: Traditionally, i++ was a post-increment operator, which meant the new incremented value would not be available until the next reference to it. Whereas the pre-increment operator ++i would make the incremented value available immediately. The use of i=i+1 is not using this logic, because the behavior is specific to the incremental operators.  \n", "Q: What is IOMMU and  will it improve my VM performance? My Motherboard's chipset supports this feature IOMMU, i've read (but not really understand) that it improves the VM performance by letting the VM make use of the actual physical hardware instead of the Virtual hardware.\nDoes this really bring a performance improvement in the VM? and if it does how can I make Virtualbox benefit from that?.\n\nA: So long story short, the only way an IOMMU will help you is if you start assigning HW resources directly to the VM. Just having it doesn't make things faster.\nIt would help to know exactly what Motherboard/CPU is advertising this feature.\nIOMMU is a system specific IO mapping mechanism and can be used with most devices. \nIOMMU sounds like a generic name for Intel VT-d and AMD IOV. In which case I don't\nthink you can multiplex devices, it's a lot like PCI passthrough before all these fancy virtualization instructions existed :). SR-IOV is different, the peripheral itself must carry the support. The HW knows it's being virtualized and can delegate a HW slice of itself to the VM. Many VMs can talk to an SR-IOV device concurrently with very low overhead.\nThe only thing faster than SR-IOV is PCI passthrough though in that case only one VM can make use of that device, not even the host operating system can use it. PCI passthrough would be useful for say a VM that runs an intense database that would benefit from being attached to a FiberChannel SAN.\nGetting closer to the HW does have limitations however, it makes your VMs less portable for deployments that require live migration for example. This applies to both SR-IOV and PCI passthrough.\nDefault virtualized Linux deployments usually use VirtIO which is pretty fast to begin with.\n", "Q: Unity launcher is missing \nPossible Duplicate:\nUnity doesn't load, no Launcher, no Dash appears \n\nwhat happened to my dock in ubuntu? 11.10 i logged out because compiz fusion icon wasnt working then when i logged on again my dock wasnt there on the left side??? and there is no logout thing on the bar on the top right. later i got online from the 'help from ubuntu online' link then i tryed downloading google chrome which i should have. then it said that i was hacked by code or something????!!!\nHELP!!!!!!\n\nA: open terminal type \nunity --reset\nand it will reset your Unity shell the panel and the launcher(you are calling it a dock)\nand Hacked?? this is Linux mate!!\n", "Q: \"Wireless authentification\" appears even when wep key is saved In Ubuntu 11.10 dialog Box \"Wireless authentification requiered\" appears even when the wep key it's alraedy saved in system.\nThat appears when I lost wireless connection and the system retry to connect\nIt's annoying to click accept each time I'm connecting to a network.\nWhat I need to do so that dialog box does not appear more?\n\nA: The wep key password is stored in network manager.

No matter what key or action i do during this time, the screen persists, and i m forced to hard boot again. \ni did not face any issue during logging out from the Unity. this is only with the gnome3 DE. since i am new to Ubuntu, i m finding it hard to resolve on my own.\nplease let me know where to check, and what to correct, to resolve this logout issue.\nthanks!\n\nA: I had the exact same problem and reported a bug. Since 2012-05-21 this problem is no longer present in my Dell Inspiron n4050 with Ubuntu 11.10 64bit and gnome-shell 3.2.2.1. One of the recent updates must have fixed the issue, so I guess it must have been fixed for you,too.\n", "Q: Cannot restore resized icons in Home Folder I resized the icons in the Home folder using Home/Edit/Preferences/Icon View Defaults/Default Zoom Level 66%.

If I am at command prompt in either DOS or Windows, I would use, (if I am in C: drive) d: to go to drive D. What is the equivalent in Ubuntu Terminal if I want to move around between partitions, from sda1 to sda2 for example?\n\nA: This is my process. Adapt the numbers as needed\n\n\n*\n\n*execute lsblk first.\n\n\n\n NAME   MAJ:MIN RM   SIZE RO TYPE MOUNTPOINT\n    sda      8:0    0 232.9G  0 disk \n    ├─sda1   8:1    0   1.5G  0 part \n    ├─sda2   8:2    0 138.6G  0 part \n    ├─sda3   8:3    0   8.1G  0 part \n    ├─sda4   8:4    0     1K  0 part \n    ├─sda5   8:5    0  68.5G  0 part /\n    └─sda6   8:6    0   5.8G  0 part \n    sdb      8:16   0  14.9G  0 disk \n    └─sdb1   8:17   0  14.9G  0 part /media/SergKolo/SERG\n    sr0     11:0    1  1024M  0 rom\n\n\n\n\n*Identify which partition is what, e.g, by size, i know /dev/sda2 is my Windows 7 partition.\n\n*execute sudo mount /dev/sda2 /media/SergKolo/\n\n*If step 3 successful , you now have folder in /media/SergKolo which will correspond to windows partition. Navigate there and enjoy\n\n\nA: Ok, this is one of the fundamental differences between windows and linux. The Windows file system uses devices as starting points for each section of the file system. So you have:\nc:\\  \nd:\\\ne:\\\n\nLinux/Unix systems use the concept of a unified file system. Everything is under the root folder, and can be arbitrarily mixed together. The user and programs do not know about devices because they have been abstracted away. So, all linux systems will have the same general hierarchy.\nA linux system will look something like this:\n/\n|---var\n|---lib\n|---home\n|---mnt\n\nBut these folder could be on the same hard drive, or separate hard drives. They can even be network folders! There is a special folder called /dev for if a program actually needs to talk to the physical device. So, anywhere that you want to go on a linux system will never require switching devices like on windows.\nHowever, sometimes a device is not added to the filesytem! It will be plugged in, the OS can see it as a device, but it has not been mounted. Modern linux systems will try and do this for you as necessary. Sometimes it doesn't work, and you have to do it your self.  That is what the mount command is for. It is also the original purpose of the /mnt folder, so you can have an obvious place to mount new sections of the file system.\nBefore mounting a drive:\n|---mnt\n    |---temp\n\nAfter mounting drive to /mnt/temp:\n|---mnt\n    |---temp\n        |---docs\n        |---programs\n        |---tmp\n        |---extra\n        |---backups\n        |---other stuff\n\nSo you can mount a drive, then use cd to move into it, or anywhere else in the file system. This allows for neat things, like having your /home directory on a separate hard drive, in case you want to switch linux distros later, or so you can back it up. The /tmp folder is often not on an actual device at all! It's could be some ram treated as a folder. That makes it easy to put stuff there, then have it cleaned up when you reboot.\n\nA: Partitions that are mounted are found in the filesystem. They are usually mounted to the folders /mnt/ or /media/.\ntype df in the terminal to display all mounted partitions and where they are mounted . You can also use the Disk Utility application to see where each partition is mounted. \nthen cd into your partition using. For example if the partition mount is called data:\ncd /media/data\n\nA: Ok, this is the way I use to go to other partition where I have saved all my data...\n   cd ..\n\nThis goes to the previous directory.\nAfter this, I am on the home folder, so I execute once again cd .. to go to the / directory, once I'm here I execute \ncd media\n\nHere you have all your mounted partitions, just execute:\nls\n\nand choose which partition you want to get in, and:\ncd partitionYouChoose\n\nyou may see here the name of a partition with many characteres like 997ac596-09ce-453b-8ccd-2120839ba825 or something like that.\nI hope to help you.\n\nA: Ok here is how you do it.\nLog into ssh as the root user.\nYou'll see this:\nroot@yourserver [~]#\n\nOk so if you saw that [~] then you are root. But it also means /root.\nIn other words, [~] = [/root]. †\nNow to get to the other partitions, such as a second hard drive, first you need to find out what partitions you have. Find this by putting lsblk\nroot@yourserver [~]# lsblk\n\nFor me, it game something like this:\nsda                  8:0    0 931.5G  0 disk\n├─sda1               8:1    0   250M  0 part /boot\n└─sda2               8:2    0 931.3G  0 part\n  ├─vg-root (dm-0) 253:0    0 915.5G  0 lvm  /\n  ├─vg-swap (dm-1) 253:1    0  11.8G  0 lvm  [SWAP]\n  └─vg-tmp (dm-2)  253:2    0     4G  0 lvm  /tmp\nsdb                  8:16   0 931.5G  0 disk\n└─sdb1               8:33   0 931.5G  0 part /mnt/home2\n\nOk, so here in this setup which I simplified above, all you need to be concerned about is the sdb1 which is the second partition (I have more drives but I removed them from the output above for this answer).\nFor me, sdb is a second hard drive, but you can do the same thing if sdb is a second partition. It essentially functions the same.\nNext, you need to get out of the root folder. Do this by doing the following:\nroot@yourserver [~]# ../\n\nNow you will be here:\nroot@yourserver [/]#\n\nNotice that [~] became [/]\nNext, you need to enter your mounts folder. You can know what this is because if you look at the lsblk above, you can see at the bottom left that sdb1 is located in the /mnt/ folder. This folder might be different for you. If so just put whatever name is there.\nFinally you are ready to enter the new hard drive or new partition. cd enters a folder.\nroot@yourserver [/]# cd mnt\n\nNow you are here:\nroot@yourserver [/mnt]#\n\nMake sure you're in the right place. Enter the following:\nroot@yourserver [/mnt]# ls\n\nNow your output might look like this.\n./  ../  home2/  secondary/\n\nIf you see the directory on the new drive or partition, you're in! Now just cd to the right place. Example (-lh flag means human readable):\nroot@yourserver [/mnt]# cd home2\n\nGreat! Now you're rolling! Now you can display the contents of your desired folder like this:\nroot@yourserver [/mnt/home2]# ls -lh\n\nYou might get an output like this:\ntotal 32K\ndrwxr-xr-x   5 root      root      4.0K Mar 12 14:09 ./\ndrwxr-xr-x.  4 root      root      4.0K Mar 12 14:00 ../\ndrwx------   2 root      root       16K Mar 12 13:58 lost+found/\ndrwx--x--x  12 myfolder1 myfolder1 4.0K Mar 12 11:33 myfolder1/\ndrwx------  11 root      root      4.0K Mar 12 14:09 myfolder2/\n\nOkay, I think that covers the scope of this question, you can take it from there! Good luck! :)\n† Side note: (proof of this is to [~]# cd ../ and then [/]# cd root and now you are back in [~]#)\nDebug info:\nThese instructions were written for a CentOS 6.5 system which is using cPanel/WHM and has a second hard drive.\n", "Q: How to install older version of GhostScript? This is second time I get segmentation fault error when I try to run GhostScript on any PDF file with pdfwrite\nFirst time it was my previous Ubuntu 11.04 distro, which afterwards I completely remove (not because of gs), format my drive etc, and then install 11.04 again\nI don't know what could be the problem. I work with GS a lot, and now all of a sudden I start getting this errors on any file, like something went wrong with this package or some of it's dependencies.\nI searched Synaptic history if there maybe some recent update could cause GS crippling but there was nothing\nI reported problems in the past (at least two times) on GS Launchpad branch, but no one even replied, and as a matter of fact no one ever replied to me on Launchpad for any report I issue, so I thought to remove completely ghostscript and install some other version.\nAt first I thought to add Debian stable repository, and install better tested version, but it turned out that perhaps that's not very good idea - adding Debian repository in Ubuntu.  \nAs I can't \"force\" Synaptic to some previous GS version (as there is only one it seems - problematic one) I don't know how to approach this problem and wanted to ask how to install previous version, 8.71 preferably, because that's the last version in Debian stable.\n\nUpdate:\nI removed GS 9.01 (and bunch of other packages on the way) and followed Boris' advice, as I didn't know what else can I do.\nI installed:\nlibgs8_8.71~dfsg2-9_i386.deb\nghostscript_8.71~dfsg2-9_i386.deb\n\nand tested GS interpreter and all was working fine.\nNow I wanted to put back all those packages removed by GS 9.01 removal, and I needed to first install ghostscript-x:\nghostscript-x_8.71~dfsg2-9_i386.deb\n\nThis is where problem begins:\n\nError:\n  Breaks existing package 'gsfonts' that conflict: 'gs'.\n  But the '/home/zetah/gs/ghostscript-x_8.71~dfsg2-9_i386.deb' provides it via: 'gs,gs-afpl,gs-esp,gs-gpl'  \n\nI didn't want to brake things so I removed just installed libgs8 and ghostscript and tried to remove gsfonts package (which additionally removed abiword, gnumeric,..) and then install all again.\nBut I found out that gsfonts is required by ghostscript and installed whenever ghostscript is installed (so ever before being able to install ghostscript-x package).\nNow after installing libgs8 and ghostscript, when I try to install ghostscript-x I get:\n\nError:\n  Breaks existing package 'ghostscript' that conflict: 'gs'.\n  But the '/home/zetah/gs/ghostscript-x_8.71~dfsg2-9_i386.deb' provides it via: 'gs,gs-afpl,gs-esp,gs-gpl'\n\nIt's exactly the same if I try with Ubuntu 10.10 ghostscript 8.71 packages from Launchpad\n\nA: As an alternative solution - you could compile the older version of ghostscript.\ndownload and extract the tar file\nDownload the tar file from launchpad.\nsetup the build environment\nsudo apt-get build-dep ghostscript-x\n\ncompile and install ghostscript\ncd [ghostscript folder location]\nsh autogen.sh\nmake\nsudo make install\n\nbinaries\nAll the binaries are installed in /usr/local/bin\nThus if you run gs -v:\n\nGPL Ghostscript 8.71 (2010-02-10) Copyright (C) 2010 Artifex\n  Software, Inc.

You can then reclaim that disk space by creating a new partition in it.\nIf you do otherwise i.e boot into the older install of Ubuntu and delete the partition for new Ubuntu installation, you may get into the situation where Grub in MBR is trying to access \"boot\" directory in the partition you just deleted and therefore system will not boot. In this case you will need to re-install Grub. If you really want to follow this path, you will first need to download Grub Rescue disk and after you have deleted the partition for newer Ubuntu installation and ran update-grub, boot your system from the rescue disk and re-install Grub from there. You can find many excellent tutorials for this using Google but if you dont have any thing important in the old installation of Ubuntu, I will suggest that you stick to first approach.\nUPDATE:\nTo answer the updated question, I believe you just need to run \"sudo update-grub\" from Ubuntu and your problem will be solved.\n", "Q: How to enable second screen (HDMI) I am new to Linux and this forum.\nI hope you can help me to solve another Linux mystery...\nI have installed ubuntu 11.10, selected Additional Drivers/activated second driver (to utilisy Unity). \nMy GPU is nvidia GT330M (laptop).\nIn Windows I often connect PC via HDMI and main display form LCD switches to display on TV (SONY Z5500).

On Windows it automatically uses windows authentication (e.g. with Internet Explorer), or enter it manually (e.g. Avast).

It only prompts me for my user password, but the Ubuntu user is not a network user.\nError Detail: W:Failed to fetch http://extras.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/dists/maverick/main/source/Sources.gz  407  Proxy Authentication Required ( The ISA Server requires authorization to fulfill the request.

The restart command invoke-rc.d cntlm restart does not restart, so the config file is never read.\n\nA: You can use cntlm to manage ISA proxy settings. \nTo get around the catch 22 of installing it, without Ubuntu Software Center being able to connect to the internet, open synaptic, choose to install cntlm and go to File->Generate package download script. Open the script in a text editor and download and install the package manually.\nThere is a very thorough guide to configure cntlm here. \n\nA: I also had the same problem but i applied the proxy system wide through network option which you will find in Dash home.\nSometime i need to refresh the Firefox also, this is the problem with Isa we need to adjust.\nBut INTERNET work fine Firefox and Ubuntu software center, See that you have the download permission of DEB extension\n", "Q: How do I recover data from a partition I resized with GParted?

I'm using Ubuntu on a Samsung Chromebook. As some of you may know, the keyboard used in ChromeOS based netbooks is a bit awkward: amongst other things, it doesn't have a Del key*. If I were going to use this netbook to its original purpose, browsing, I guess it wouldn't be a problem, but I need to program with it, and I miss a lot of keys, specially the Delete one, but also Page Up, Page Down, home and End. \nSo I've been looking for a way to remap Alt+Backspace to Page Up, Alt+left arrow to Home, Alt+down to Page Down, and so on...\nI have found a lot of explanations on how to remap one key, but I don't know how I can remap a key combination to a single key. Has anyone tried to do something like this?\nThanks a lot.\n*I mean, the key that deletes a character to the right. We call it \"Supr\" in Spain, I am not sure how it's in english-speaking countries.\n\nA: You can use xbindkeys to grab the keys and xvkbd to send keys.\nCreate a file .xbindkeysrc in your home directory and paste this text:\n\"xvkbd -xsendevent -text '\\[Delete]'\"\n  Alt + BackSpace\n\n\"xvkbd -xsendevent -text '\\[Home]'\"\n  Alt + Left\n\n\"xvkbd -xsendevent -text '\\[Page_Down]'\"\n  Alt + Down\n\nThen start xbindkeys and it should work. Probably you want to map more keys, then after you edited the .xbindkeysrc you can run pkill -HUP xbindkeys to send a HUP signal to xbindkeys (or kill xbindkeys and start it again).\nTo see the key names that xbindkeys sees, you can run xbindkeys -mk (man xbindkeys has more info).\nTo see the key names that xvkbd knows, have a look in /usr/include/X11/keysymdef.h (maybe someone else knows a better method?).\nxbindkeys only runs until your X session ends, so you probably want to put it in your startup (auto-start) programs.\n", "Q: apache2 digest authentication Here is my site file on Ubuntu server 11.10:\n<IfModule mod_ssl.c>\n<VirtualHost *:443>\n    ServerAdmin webmaster@localhost\n\n    DocumentRoot /var/www/mydir\n    ServerAlias *.mydomain.no-ip.info\n    <Directory />\n            Options FollowSymLinks\n            AllowOverride None\n    </Directory>\n    <Directory /var/www/mydir>\n            Options Indexes FollowSymLinks MultiViews\n            AllowOverride None\n            Order allow,deny\n            allow from all\n    </Directory>\n\n    ScriptAlias /cgi-bin/ /usr/lib/cgi-bin/\n    <Directory \"/usr/lib/cgi-bin\">\n            AllowOverride None\n            Options +ExecCGI -MultiViews +SymLinksIfOwnerMatch\n            Order allow,deny\n            Allow from all\n    </Directory>\n\n    ErrorLog ${APACHE_LOG_DIR}/error.log\n\n    # Possible values include: debug, info, notice, warn, error, crit,\n    # alert, emerg.\n    LogLevel warn\n\n    CustomLog ${APACHE_LOG_DIR}/ssl_access.log combined\n\n    Alias /doc/ \"/usr/share/doc/\"\n    <Directory \"/usr/share/doc/\">\n            Options Indexes MultiViews FollowSymLinks\n            AllowOverride None\n            Order deny,allow\n            Deny from all\n            Allow from 127.0.0.0/255.0.0.0 ::1/128\n    </Directory>\n\n    #   SSL Engine Switch:\n    #   Enable/Disable SSL for this virtual host.\n    SSLEngine on\n\n    #   A self-signed (snakeoil) certificate can be created by installing\n    #   the ssl-cert package.

I have accidentally removed /etc/ folder.\nNow there is no way to do any administration, because /etc/passwd and /etc/shadow are lost.\nIs there any way to restore it in Ubuntu?\n\nA: Here is how I would proceed.\nIf you want to try to manually recover, boot the ubuntu live CD and update everything\nsudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get -y dist-upgrade\n\nYou then mount your ubuntu partition at /mnt\nsudo -i\nmount /dev/sdxy /mnt\n\nYou can the copy /etc to /mnt/etc\ncp -Raf /etc /mnt\n\nYou will then need to manually edit /mnt/etc/passwd and /mnt/etc/group and /mnt/etc/sudoers\nThe format should be easy enough to understand from existing entries, but if not ask. Make sure your user is in the admin group.\nAdd in your user to those files ^^\nThen chroot\nsudo chroot /mnt\n\nAnd set your user password\npasswd your_user\n\nYou also need to update /mnt/etc/fstab , define your root partition and swap. You can use the live CD as a template for most of the entries.\nreboot and hope it works.\nIf not, boot the live CD and back up your data to a flash driver or alternate partition and re-install.\nBest of luck\n\nA: Restore from backup, or reinstall.  If you reinstall, use manual partitioning, and do not check the format box and your personal data should remain intact.  More recent releases also have the option to reinstall/replace the existing install, without formatting.  This is easier to use than manual partitioning.\n\nA: Restoring files from ext4 is not really easy :-/\nYou could start from the Live CD and copy all the files from there into your /etc directory. But I fear that will not work.\nA clean install should give you better results in less time, but everything will be lost. Personal data has to be backed up before!\n\nA: You can get a list of all installed packages with\ndpkg --get-selections\n\nand you can reinstall packages with\nsudo apt-get --reinstall install packagenames\n\nWith those two commands one could build one command which reinstalls all installed packages. This could help. However, I do not have the time now, to create this command for you. If someone has time - please just edit this posting.\n", "Q: How to remove VLC Nightly Build? I would like to remove the VLC nightly build and go back to the default VLC player.

(in your case vlc-daily)\nsudo ppa-purge ppa:videolan/master-daily\nThis downgrades the vlc version from the daily version of the ppa to the stable version in the ubuntu universe repo.\n\nA: A vlc package install consists of at least 5 packages, typically at least 7.

I guess that's a yay! =)\n", "Q: Ubuntu One Significantly Slower than DropBox I have tried many times to make the switch to Ubuntu One but I never could because of it being significantly slower at uploading files than DropBox.  I want the extra space and the integration with the desktop that it brings.  Does anyone know why U1 may be acting like this?\n\nA: Please understand that Ubuntu One is a relatively new service compared with Dropbox. A lot of effort has been put in to integration and easiness of use for the end users.\nThese are normal things to sort out in the close future. I do not believe that there is something actually wrong with any configuration and will gradually improve with time and further releases of the software.\n\nA: Dropbox will not always re-upload a file. It will first analyze the file (md5-check I think) and if you or another user already has the file on the server it will use that one instead. They said so in their blog (check the part that says Data Practices).\nNote that this was also the reason for some security problems they had, as a hack allowed users to \"upload\" files they never had in the first place.\nIf you want to make a direct comparison of upload speeds, I suggest you use unique files, such as a truecrypt container with a long encryption key.\n\nA: There are two possibilities for the speed difference, both worth investigating:\n\n\n*\n\n*Dropbox uses deduplication extensively (both within and between accounts). By using an rsync like checksum method, they can identify data that they already have, and therefore don't need to upload. This will give the \"impression\" of a faster upload. One way to check this is to upload some NEW guaranteed unique files that defeats the dedupe mechanism (encrypted files should work).\n\n*Dropbox uses a hub and spoke architecture (for connecting with the Dropbox servers that handle the metadata, and the Amazon S3 servers that handle the data). However, under certain circumstances, it can also switch to a peer to peer transfer within a subnet. Available bandwidth between computers on the same subnet is far greater than between the subnet and the internet servers at S3, giving the illusion of different upload performance. Try having your different machines in a different (IP) location, this may defeat the p2p mechanism (unless Dropbox is smarter than I think they are).\n\nA: One possibility here is that ubuntu one is using less bandwidth for upload than dropbox. You can easily confirm this by watching your upload speed in your router or even by using 'system monitor'. Take a look at this to change the upload speed u1 is using.\nHow does one manage the upload speed of Ubuntu One?\nIf you can confirm both services are using the same upload speed, but u1 is slower than dropbox, try also making sure your running the latest version of u1. Then repeat the test and see. If ubuntu one is still slower, than the final difference has to do with server file post-processing. U1 processes files you upload adding some useful metadata about them in some cases. However, both ubuntu one and dropbox use amazon's s3 service, so in theory the backends should have the same speed.\n\nA: There are some performance concerns which are being worked on, on both the client and server side. A lot of small files will make things much slower, than for a few larger files, for example. The Ubuntu One team is constantly working on improvements to both performance and usability, as well as adding new features. There are some bug reports about performance already, though you may wish to open another one. I'm not sure what else to say, but rest assured performance and usability are big concerns for the U1 team, and they are being looked at. Though unfortunately everything can't have top priority to be fixed tomorrow. It isn't a team of infinite monkeys. :)\n", "Q: Video Drivers for Onboard GeForce 6150SE I'm currently using the proprietary driver (version current-updates).

Today I saw an article about extensions for GNOME Shell, so it got me thinking a couple of questions that may apply to many users in Unity:\n\n\n*\n\n*Will the GNOME Shell extensions be compatible with Unity?\n\n*Can I install them directly to Unity from the https://extensions.gnome.org/ website?\n\n*In case 2 is NO, is there a similar idea for Unity in the works?\n\nA: No. They are only for gnome-shell. They are expecting a special API, are written in javascript, and in general are too different to be used on Unity.\nNote that the idea of writing most of the gnome-shell UI in javascript will make it very easy to write extensions that can hook near everywhere. Of course it will take a penalty in speed. It's quite similar to the trade-offs between Firefox and Chrome. Firefox UI is written in XUL (an extension of javascript) and Chrome in C++. The former is way easier to extend, but the later is likely going to be always faster and more responsive (I'm talking about the UI, not the rendering or javascript engine).\nSo to answer you second question, no, likely Gnome-Shell is going to be always more customizable than Unity as a result of a design decision.\n\nA: *\n\n*NO. gnome shell extensions are meant to be used on gnome shell only.\nand they don't have any effect when using unity.\n\n*you can install them directly from your browser, yes, but you will\nsee a difference using gnome shell only.\n\n*NO, no similar idea. unity uses compiz and you can browse the ccsm\nmangaer to change things in there.\n\n", "Q: What's wrong with my Ubuntu appearance I don't know what happened but my background become idle.

From Ubuntu 11.10 and so, Ubuntu uses Gnome 3.x (GTK3+) libraries which are way much different from past versions of Ubuntu (GTK2+). \nFrom your screenshot it seem to me that you must have installed a PPA to your system that brings those Gnome 3.x libraries as dependencies. Because this libraries are marked as \"upgrade\" for your system, they have upgraded some parts of your Ubuntu, like the new appearance settings which is available for the new version (11.10) of Ubuntu.\nWhat you can do is:\n\n\n*\n\n*Find which PPA caused this and remove it\n\n*Refresh your package list\n\n*Uninstall gnome-settings-daemon and then install it again\n\n\nYou should now have the old one that is compatible with your system (Ubuntu 11.04)\n", "Q: Drops to BusyBox, but can continue upon exiting So I just installed 11.10 on my Dell Precision T5500 from the live cd.

However, if I simply type \"exit\" and Enter it continues booting and I get the Ubuntu graphical login screen.

It would be nice to be able to reboot my system remotely.  \n\nA: You can try the solution you found by editing /etc/default/grub instead; edit the line labelled GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT and run sudo update-grub to make the changes take effect.\nYou should end up with something like\nGRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT=\"quiet splash bootdelay=90\"\n\nThis has the same effect as editing menu.lst (actually, it's now called grub.cfg) but in a way that the Ubuntu packages understand, so when a kernel or grub gets updated, the changes will persist.

Even if matlab has finished with the data in the files it is still quite possible it would mess up your simulations.

Is it possible to find files that have been deleted and the trash is empty?\nMy desktop was cleaned out and I am not sure why, but it had some files I would like to recover.\n\nA: Maybe...\nI suggest you give extundelete a try. (Assuming that you use an ext partition)\n\nextundelete is a utility that can recover deleted files from an ext3 or ext4 partition. The ext3 file system is the most common file system when using Linux, and ext4 is its successor. extundelete uses the information stored in the partition's journal to attempt to recover a file that has been deleted from the partition. There is no guarantee that any particular file will be able to be undeleted, so always try to have a good backup system in place, or at least put one in place after recovering your files! \n\nAs the site warns, the more writes to the filesystem, the less likely you'll get any files. You probably want to unmount your partition immediately and then run the program.\n\nA: Files that had been emptied from Trash may have been overwritten. Only those files that were not overwritten we may be able to recover with extundelete .\n\nTherefore stop using the partition that holds accidentally deleted files.\n\nIt is recommended the drive is mounted read only to avoid data loss. For our Trash this means that we need to boot to an Ubuntu live session to proceed. We then install exundelete to the live session and mount our HOME partition on /dev/sfXx read only to the live system:\nubuntu@ubuntu: sudo mount /dev/<sdXx> -o ro /mnt \n\nWe get best results in case we remembered the exact name of a file we want to recover because we may not need remnants of all files we ever had deleted.\nBy default files will be recovered to a directory RECOVERED_FILES in the current path from where we had run it. On a live system this needs to be adapted to another output dir on a partition or drive different to the partition we want to recover files from. This partition will have to be mounted with write access to the live system too, e.g. with Nautilus, or to a mount point different to above.\nTo recover a known file from Trash we issue extundelete with the following options:\nsudo extundelete --restore-file  /mnt/home/<user>/.local/share/Trash/files/<name> --output-dir <path> -- /dev/sdXx\n\nReplace <user> by your user name, <name> by the filename we want to recover, <path> by the path we want to write recovered files to.\nWe can give extundelete a list of files from a file with the option --restore-files <filename>,  a directory with the option --restore-directory or let it recover all it finds --restore-all.

I'm fairly sure this is a basic question, nevertheless I'm having some problems with solving this.\nI'm trying to set up different startup profiles set specifically to different activities... like when I want to do web development and such, it would start the Apache server and other stuff, but when I'm not these services would be disabled - once I get the logic of it, I can tailor it, hope you get the picture as to what I'd like to do.\nMy first thought was that it would be selected in Grub, but if anyone has a different suggestion, don't hold it in. :)\nThanks,\nDin\n\nA: I think the easiest way would be to create multiple accounts with activity as real name and then you link them together with symlinks and you can put a script in \"Startup Application\" to have the services started you want.\n\nA: The cleaner way to do this would be to use runlevels.\nEach runlevel starts a different set of services. While you could simply use a script at logon, you could create a specific runlevel for casual use, server use, etc.\nThe tool Ubuntu uses to configure what services start with each runlevel is called Upstart. A simple tool 'chkconfig', installable from the Ubuntu main repositories, will help you set those up.\nsudo apt-get install chkconfig\n\nOnce you have configured each runlevel, you are going to have to start it. I think the cleanest way to do that would be from GRUB. \nCreate a different entry for each runlevel (copy & paste current kernel startup section to create a new entry), then find the line like: 'linux   /boot/vmlinuz-2.6.38-14-generic root=UUID=1459c642-797c-4a9b-be5c-fdfad2a6689c ro   quiet splash vt.handoff=7' and add the number of the runlevel you want to boot into at the end.\nExample: linux   /boot/vmlinuz-2.6.38-14-generic root=UUID=1459c642-797c-4a9b-be5\nc-fdfad2a6689c ro   quiet splash vt.handoff=7 3\nTo check the runlevel after boot:\nwho -r\n\nBelow are some links to start you off:\nBasics of runlevels\nAdvanced: Auto-Config of GRUB - so you don't have to manually edit the GRUB file with each kernel release\nUsing Upstart and Chkconfig\n", "Q: Random disconnects with an Atheros AR5008 For the most part my Wireless network works perfectly fine.

I'm on Ubuntu 11.10, and I want to share a folder on an automounted NTFS partition (/dev/sda4) over the network. The purpose of this network is to share files between computers, it contains mostly Windows computers. I use this /dev/sda4 partition both from Windows 7 and Ubuntu. Using Nautilus, I right-click the directory, then I click 'Sharing Options', then I mark the three checkboxes. When I try to apply the settings though, it says 'Couldn't change the rights of the folder \"foldername\"'.\nI've put the output of sudo blkid and cat /etc/fstab below.\nsudo blkid\n/dev/sda2: LABEL=\"Windows\" UUID=\"481319C261268D8D\" TYPE=\"ntfs\" \n/dev/sda3: UUID=\"23dac5e8-aae7-43ac-964c-c8a5a033b0d7\" TYPE=\"ext4\" \n/dev/sda4: LABEL=\"Data\" UUID=\"00F1B269675B86AE\" TYPE=\"ntfs\" \n/dev/sda5: UUID=\"6de8b757-f17e-4e36-935c-a3fd6012c628\" TYPE=\"ext4\" \n/dev/sda6: UUID=\"d504bae2-fad6-4f6a-b489-7719ad0fe3b3\" TYPE=\"swap\" \n\ncat /etc/fstab\n# <file system> <mount point>   <type>  <options>       <dump>  <pass>\nproc            /proc           proc    nodev,noexec,nosuid 0       0\n# / was on /dev/sda3 during installation\nUUID=23dac5e8-aae7-43ac-964c-c8a5a033b0d7 /               ext4    errors=remount-ro 0       1\n# swap was on /dev/sda6 during installation\nUUID=d504bae2-fad6-4f6a-b489-7719ad0fe3b3 none            swap    sw              0       0\n/dev/sda4 /media/Data ntfs defaults,umask=007,gid=46 0 0 \n\nHow can I share this folder?\n\nA: After a bit of searching, I found the solution myself:\nFirst, I had to give myself the ownership over /dev/sda4, and I had to give group and others read and execute permission. I did that by changing the partition entry in /etc/fstab.\nTo do that, I had to know my uid and gid. So the first thing I did was writing the following command in a Terminal:\nid $USER\nThis will give an output like this:\nUID=1000(myname) GID=1000(myname) groups=1000(myname),4(adm),24(cdrom), ...\n\nSo now I knew that both my uid and my gid were 1000.\nDo you already know the name of the NTFS partition? If not, type this command in a Terminal:\nsudo blkid\nand write down the NTFS partition on a piece of paper.\nNow, to change the permissions, I edited /etc/fstab with the nano text editor. So, the next command you have to type in a terminal is:\nsudo nano /etc/fstab\nGo all the way down and type this line:\n/dev/sda4 /media/Data ntfs defaults,umask=0022,uid=YourUIDHere,gid=YourGIDHere 0 0\n\n(You should replace /dev/sda4 by the NTFS partition that you wrote down earlier).\n Explanation: umask=0022 sets the directory's (d) permissions permissions to drwxr-xr-x, to make sure that the user (me) can read, write and execute (rwx) while the group and others can only read and execute (r-x) the directory, which is what I wanted.\nAfter that, I could mark the three checkboxes without any errors, and the folder would be shared over the network. Because I was not sure whether the sharing settings would be kept after a restart, I unchecked the checkboxes and added some lines in /etc/samba/smb.conf instead. I did that this way:\nIn a terminal, I typed sudo nano /etc/samba/smb.conf\nI scrolled down to the last line, and pasted the following there:\n[MyShare]\n    comment = My Share\n    path = /media/Data/FolderToBeShared\n    browseable = yes\n    guest ok = yes\n    read only = yes\n    create mask = 0755\n\nI saved the file, and then rebooted. The folder was accessible from the network now.\n\n\nA: just mount the ntfs dir as:\n-o uid=current_user,gid=current_usergroup\n\nget the current user and current user group as pointed by Exeleration-G:\nid MyUserName\n\n\nA: The most simple solution I can think of us is to use a symlink to the NTFS partition.\nHow I would do this is:\n\n\n*\n\n*Create a folder on your Ubuntu partition that you can share.\n\n*Link the folder on the windows partition to be within this folder:\nln -s /path/to/folder/on/ntfs /path/to/new/location/linkname\n\n*Set the parent folder you created to be shared over the network, choosing any extra options as you desire (for example, allowing guest etc).\n\n*Click \"apply permissions to enclosed files\" in the permissions tab. Not every single permission will be applied, of course, but read access should be enough.\n\n\nI have not tested this myself, but if I understand sharing correctly, it should be able to work.\n", "Q: How do I create a file and mount it as a filesystem? How do I create a file of size 10M, format it with ext3 filesystem and then mount it in /media/fuse?\nI tried with\nmkfs -t ext3 file\n\nthen to mount it\nmount -t ext3 file /media/fuse\n\nIt didn't work because it said that file wasn't a block device. Can anybody help me?\n\nA: Your procedure is correct, but when mounting a file image as a filesystem you have to add the -o loop option to the mount command:\nmount -t ext3 -o loop file /media/fuse\n\nAlso, the -t ext3 option is not strictly required, because mount can automatically determine the filesystem type.\n\nA: I tried to apply the steps and comments from the previous answer.\nIt still took some work to figure it out, so I've added another answer for people after me.\nThe following procedure creates a local file named file and mounts it on a local directory named mounted_file.\n\n*\n\n*Create a fixed size file with e.g.\ndd if=/dev/zero of=file bs=1000 count=100\n\nwhich creates a file of 100 times 1000 bytes (100 kB) filled with zeroes.\n\n*Format it with the desired file system, create a directory, mount it, and get permission to use it (owner is root):\nmkfs.ext3 file\nmkdir mounted_file/\nsudo mount -o loop file mounted_file/\nsudo chmod -R 777 mounted_file/\n\nThe -o loop parameter is optional nowadays.\n\n*To clean up afterwards:\nsudo umount mounted_file/\nrmdir mounted_file/\nrm file\n\nUse mkfs.ext3 -n file to see the details of the file system that will created. If desired e.g. the block size (-b block-size) and number of inodes (-N number-of-inodes) can be changed.\nNote that we can also run out of inodes (total number of files and directories) instead of diskspace, which is usually not clearly communicated.\n\nA: Personally, I prefer using truncate -s 10M filename (then mkfs) because truncate expands dynamically unlike fallocate or dd and can also be resized larger (or smaller) without damaging data with losetup and resize2fs. And of course it can be mounted as a filesystem.\nSee here for more detail: https://unix.stackexchange.com/a/698656/346155\n", "Q: Building a 32-bit app in 64-bit Ubuntu After hours of googling, I decide to give up and ask you experts. I am trying to build a 32-bit application (xgap if anyone interested) in my 64 Ubuntu 11.10. I added the CFLAGS=-m32 and the LDFLAGS=-L/usr/lib32 in the makefile. The objects are built into 32 bit fine. The last step is to link all the objects and libraries for X windows into this executable---xgap. Somehow it keeps giving me this error:\ngcc -o xgap xcmds.o utils.o gapgraph.o gaptext.o pty.o popdial.o xgap.o selfile.o   -L/usr/lib32 -lXaw -lXmu -lXt -lXext -lX11  -lSM -lICE\n\n/usr/bin/ld: skipping incompatible /usr/lib32/libXmu.so when searching for -lXmu\n...\n\n/usr/bin/ld: i386 architecture of input file `xcmds.o' is incompatible with i386:x86-64 output\n...\n\nI have installed ia32-libs and mutilib support. I think I just need to force the linker to generate a i386 output. I tried to put two ld flags in my gcc command as shown above: -melf_i386 and -oformat elf32-i386. But what happens is that gcc doesn't search for the 32 bit library in /usr/lib32 anymore. I wonder if I need to put those flags in some fixed order? \nThanks for any idea and help!\nEDIT: when I add the -m32 flag in my last gcc command (the linking stage I believe), even if I have the -L/usr/lib32 flag in place, gcc doesn't search in /usr/lib32 anymore ( really weird...) and generates the following error: \n/usr/bin/ld: skipping incompatible /usr/lib/gcc/x86_64-linux-gnu/4.6.1/../../../libXaw.so when searching for -lXaw\n/usr/bin/ld: skipping incompatible /usr/lib/libXaw.so when searching for -lXaw\n/usr/bin/ld: cannot find -lXaw\ncollect2: ld returned 1 exit status\n\nAny one has any idea why this happens? I am using the auto tool to configure and make. I am really good at modifying those script files.\nEIDT:I solved the problem. I think that gcc was expecting a static library archive. I used the getlibs script from http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=474790 to download all the .a archives needed for linking. Then gcc worked. I think gcc did search in /usr/lib32 directory but didn't find the  .a archives so went on to search in the standard directory which is /usr/lib, where it finds the incompatible *.so files. \nBut then the question is: the *.so files in /usr/lib32/ from package ia32-libs doesn't really have the libraries needed for linking? What are those files in /usr/lib32/ used for?\n\nA: LDFLAGS should include -m32 as well. Following should work:\nexport LDFLAGS='-m32 -L/usr/lib32'\n\nIn fact, you can drop -L/usr/lib32 part, since this is a default directory for 32bit libs, and your system is aware about that.\nBasically, the simplest way to build 32bit application on 64bit machine is:\nexport CFLAGS='-m32'\nexport CXXFLAGS='-m32'\nexport LDFLAGS='-m32'\nmake\n\n..or feed those variables to configure script if you're using autotools.\nUPDATE:\nSeems like you are not really familiar about the differences in linking with static and dynamic libraries. I'll try to be as minimal as possible:\n\n\n*\n\n*Both static and dynamic development libraries have the same file extension .a\n\n*If you have installed both static and dynamic versions of the same library, one of them might have additional postfix, like libname.a for dynamic and libname_s.a for static version.\n\n*Sure, static and dynamic library versions differs in size. Static version is heavier.\n\n*If you link with static library - your application has no dependencies. If you link with dynamic library, it will rely on .so runtime library that should be present in your system.\n\n\nPlease note, we are not talking about advanced tricks here, like explicit loading of DSO's using the dlopen()/dlsym() API.\n\nA: I was getting errors such as:\n/usr/bin/ld: skipping incompatible /usr/lib/gcc/x86_64-linux-gnu/4.8/libstdc++.so when searching for -lstdc++\n\nThis fixed it for me:\nsudo apt-get install g++-multilib\n\nif you are using a gcc package other than the default one (e.g. gcc-7), then you'll need to install the package for that specific version:\nsudo apt-get install g++-7-multilib\n\n", "Q: How to make Adwaita Dark theme apply only to certain applications? Is this possible to apply Adwaita Dark theme only to some applications? \nI want to enable it for the Terminal and maybe Nautilus but not other applications, because Opera and Software Center and possibly other non GTK applications look ugly/unreadable with Adwaita Dark theme.\n\nA: For GTK2 apps, the way to do this was relatively simple. You can launch a gtk2 app with a custom theme like this:\nGTK2_RC_FILES=(path-to-theme) (command)\n\nSo for example, this worked:\nGTK2_RC_FILES=/usr/share/themes/Redmond/gtk-2.0/gtkrc catfish\n\n(Catfish is an app I know to be gtk2 -- you may not have it installed.)\nUnfortunately, this feature broke entirely in GTK3. I can't gaurantee this will work perfectly, but you could try making simple shell scripts that configure a theme, launch the app, then unconfigure the theme. If you launch two apps at the same time, that my result in a race condition with unpredictable results.\nSo for example, you could launch gedit like this:\n#!/bin/sh\nif [ -h ~/.config/gtk-3.0 ]\n  then\n    rm ~/.config/gtk-3.0\nfi\nln -s /usr/share/themes/HighContrast/gtk-3.0 ~/.config\ngedit \"$@\" &\nsleep 1\nif [ -h ~/.config/gtk-3.0 ]\n  then\n    rm ~/.config/gtk-3.0\nfi\n\nBesides the race condition, doing this has some other undesirable side-effects. For one, you'll use more memory for each application that has its own theme. For another, you'll have to write custom shell scripts and launchers for each app. Finally, in my opinion, your desktop will look weird.\nBut there. That's how you can do it, sort of.\n\nA: No, theme is for entire applications\nbut some applications like monodevelop allows to chose specific theme for it(it applies for some java apps too)\n", "Q: How can I make a script run automatically after gdm login and logout?

Or at least that is what my experience is when I was trying to view them.  I searched for information about it and I found some people who complained about this feature missing.\nI am wondering if anyone has suggestions for a good PDF viewer that run in gnome and displays comments in an annotated PDF file.  I don't care about being to annotate the file myself right now, I just want to be able to view comments made by someone else.\n\nA: Well it seems Adobe has turned its back on the Linux community so I have to update this answer. I suppose you have moved to the latest Ubuntu or at least one that can use the more capable open source applications below.\nViewers With Annotation Viewing Capabilities\nOpen source viewers\nOkular\nA KDE based application, runs ok and looks ok in Gnome, one of the best open source applications that can both view and create annotations, note that this application can do standard and non standard annotations. You can create annotations that can be viewed by all viewers that support the pdf standard for annotations. \nyou can create annotations that does not interfere with the document, you will need to use Okular to view these, these can then be converted to standard annotations if you need to.\nEvince\nThe default viewer on Ubuntu and most Gnome based desktops, the latest now have a somewhat limited support for standard pdf annotation viewing. \nProprietary Solutions\nPDF Studio Pro\nA very good fully capable PDF viewer and editor, from Qoppa Software, there are trial versions available for standard and pro, the pro verson has most of the features of Expensive tools from Adobe.\n\nSome notable features of the pro version\n\n\n*\n\n*Redaction, block out parts of documents you do not want people to see.\n\n*OCR, Make scanned pdf searchable \n\n*Digital Signature, sign documents adding image of signature.\n\n*Create and fill forms\n\n*Measure Tool, measure using scale factors, CAD type dimensioning.  \n\n\nKami (Formerly Notable PDF)\nKami is a browser based solution, can view standard annotations, can create non standard annotations, this works with Google Chrome browser, you can save annotated PDFs on Google Drive read PDF documents from web pages,and download to desktop or save to Google Drive this can replace Chrome's default PDF viewer, there are free, premium and Work versions available the premium version is $15.00 a year and the work version is $50.00 a year.\n\nSome work features\n\n\n*\n\n*Ocr, create searchable pdf.\n\n*Unlimited e-Signature\n\n*Unlimited Files to Split\n\n*Unlimited Files to Merge\n\n\nA: To view comments in PDF files under linux you may consider using current version of Firefox. Just drag PDF file into browser window or put absolute path to given file in the location bar (ie. /home/username/Documents/file.pdf) and hit Enter.\nIf you are using older version of Firefox it's possible that this feature is disabled by default (since it sometimes caused problems; howtogeek.com has an article that describes how to enable it). You may also install it as addon from:\nhttps://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/pdfjs/\n\nA: As much as I had experienced, there is no native applications on Ubuntu which could open annotated PDF files \"cleanly\". I had tried opening with evince, xpdf, xournal, inkscape and no luck.\nThe good news is, I found a \"dirty\" way to view the annotation text by using openoffice. More accurately, the annotated text can be read in openoffice writer.\nI had success viewing annotated text in OpenOffice 2.4, so newer version may display better [Unfortunately, I am new to AskUbuntu so I cannot post screenshot here].\nAbove all, to \"cleanly\" view annotated text in PDF, you would have to depend on Windows applications (such as Foxit Feader, etc) installed via Wine.\n\nA: Master PDF Editor\nMaster PDF Editor is  another  program for editing PDF files in Linux. \nIt enables you to create, edit, view, encrypt, sign and print interactive PDF documents.\n\nIt is a Proprietary Software but can also be used unregistered; further info on https://code-industry.net/free-pdf-editor/\nDownload on https://code-industry.net/free-pdf-editor/#get the newest deb package and install it or use   \nwget https://code-industry.net/public/master-pdf-editor-5.1.12_qt5.amd64.deb\nsudo apt install ./master-pdf-editor-5.1.12_qt5.amd64.deb\n\n\nA: The modern Browser seem to be able to open PDF and show annotations.\nI can confirm for Chrome, other poster here pointed it out for Firefox.\nYou can just move the PDF on it.\nAnd I just found out: Adobe Reader 9 is on my system and works fine (Ubuntu 18.04).\nYou may have to change AdobeReader.desktop in\n/opt/Adobe/Reader9/Resource/Support/\nor\n/usr/share/applications/\n\nAdd a %U to the end of Exec= line, so it looks something like this:\nExec=acroread %U\n\nFound it in ubuntuforums\n", "Q: Should I as a developer use var/www in conjuction with apache? I come from a strong Windows background. Therefore with IIS I have some site on my D drive, I then point IIS at this location and start serving files. With Apache though it seems var/www is the default location. This would match IIS in the sense that IIS uses wwwroot or similar.\nFor local development I am used to using something within my user directory, but is this the standard practice for development on Linux? \n\n\n*\n\n*Should I copy my code to var/www whenever I make a change? \n\n*Should I use folders within my home directory? \n\n*Or should I use another location all together?\n\n*Does anyone know of an IIS to Apache tutorial?\n\n\nI should add that when I change var/www to home/shaun/sites I cannot serve any files, hence I think I should not be doing this, or at least use another directory.\n\nA: Apache is a powerful and flexible web server and there is ample documentation on the web.\nTo get you started:\n1) Yes, the default web root is /var/www\n2) You can change Apache's behavior if you wish. From your question , I would activate the home directory option.\nsudo  a2enmod userdir\n\nRestart apache\nTo use a directory in your home, make a directory public_html\nmkdir ~/public_html\n\nPut your web pages in ~/public_html\nFYI: ~ is short hand for your home directory.\nYou can browse them with \nhttp://server/~username\nor\nhttp://localhost/~username\nWhere \"username\" is your log in user name.\nThat should get you started, do not feel overwhelmed if you do not understand all that code yet, you will learn.\nSee:\nApache symlinked to home directory - Permission Errors\nhttps://help.ubuntu.com/10.04/serverguide/C/httpd.html\n\nA: The answers to this question https://askubuntu.com/a/25045/9598 can be illustrative also. In my case I don't wish to change Apache's behavior, just the folder that I am going to use for testing purposes, of which I suggest you to give a chance to this:\n\nHowever, if we wish to use another local folder for testing in our PHP\n  code, we can change the default folder location used by our php engine\n  to manage these files. This is done using the following procedure:\ngksu gedit /etc/apache2/sites-available/default\n\nProvide user password\nThen, change all occurrences of \"/var/www/\" to the folder that we use\n  to test our PHP. (Example: /home/geppettvs/www/ or where appropriate,\n  change \"geppettvs\" by your local folder.\nAfter that you must restart the computer for the purpose of the\n  changes to take effect. Do not forget also that the files must have\n  the proper file permissions to run properly. (755 is usually\n  sufficient, but some folders [and/or files] may need 777 permissions\n  to read and write them correctly.)\n\nThis procedure was working on Natty, and I can't say for 11.10 yet. And I use this trick in order to test PHP, that's why I drop the warning about the 777 permissions for some files/folders.\nIf you do this, you can gain access to your files via http://localhost instead of calling a given folder name. The \"www\" folder (or whatever you name it) will be your \"public_html\" folder.\nGood luck!\nIMPORTANT: People have suggested that you don't need to restart your machine in order to the changes take effect, but if you don't, then you must stop and restart apache, restart your session and pray for everything to work without a hassle. I suggest you to restart the computer and I can say for sure it will work.\n", "Q: What is the difference between Eject and Safely Remove Device Taking this question and it's answer into account What is the difference between \"Unmount\", \"Eject\", \"Safely Remove Drive\" and the eject icon? I ask:\nWhy do both options appear if they are the same. \nIs there some kind of difference in regards to how they unmount the unit (Just in case they changed their functionality in the latest Ubuntu versions) and if they are the same, would it be possible to remove one of them.\n\nA: Eject unmounts the file system  and ejects the CD but in the case of a flask media drive, it is still connected to the system (ie. can still be re-mounted or re-accessed and is still connected to the hub's 5V supply).\nSafely Remove unmounts and disconnects the drive from the hub (ie. in enabled hubs it will remove power from the device). In this case, the only way to remount it is to unplug/re-plug the device for the hub to re-enable it.\nFor removal purposes, Safely Remove is the best option. Eject is useful to unmount the file system so Gparted or another program can access the device directly.\n\nA: One further nuance for choosing between them:\nIf you have one of those built-in sets of slots for SD/SDHC/MicroSD cards then using Safely Remove will remove power to the device, rendering it useless until the computer is re-booted.\nIt is better to use Unmount which will allow the slot to be used again.\n\nA: umount removes the device from the file system (mount point).\nEject and Safely remove both do basically the same thing on a flash drive.\nsync the data , then un-mount (remove the drive from the file system).\nIn addition, eject would eject the media (think CD/DVD).\nIt is sort of a bug that both these options show with flash drives.\nThe expected behavior would be\nSafely Remove - USB/Flash drive - sync data && unmount ; user then physically removes the drive\nEject - CDROM/DVD - unmount && eject physical media\n", "Q: How to install Hercules Webcam Deluxe I am trying to install a Hercules Webcam Deluxe on my Ubuntu 11.10 (64 bits).

I would really like to have a easy administrable System providing all my thousands of mail on a local machine, making me able to access them both with standard email client like Thunderbird and via a good web interface. Thank you for any advice!\n\nA: Zarafa doesnt provide packages for 11.10, but only for the Ubuntu LTS versions. The only way to run Zarafa on 11.10 would be to compile the packages yourself (that would be the opposite of easy).\nFor administrating your server you should take a look at Z-Admin (https://community.zarafa.com/pg/plugins/project/672/developer/zarq/zadmin) its an recently as final published web control panel from the Zarafa Community.

This isn't a bad choice if you want to be able to access the files from both Ubuntu and Windows, but has slightly different semantics to native file systems.\nThe NTFS driver does have support for mapping Windows user IDs to equivalent UNIX user IDs though, which might help.  There is a tool called ntfs-3g.usermap that can help you build up the user mapping:\n\n\n*\n\n*First unmount the NTFS partition by running sudo umount /dev/sdb1 from a terminal.\n\n*Build up the user map by running sudo ntfs-3g.usermap /dev/sdb1 in the terminal.  Provide the Ubuntu user account names for each Windows account you want to map.  The program will create a file called UserMap in the current directory.\n\n*Remount the file system and copy the UserMap file to the special .NTFS-3G directory:\nsudo mount -t ntfs-3g /dev/sdb1 /mnt\nsudo mkdir /mnt/.NTFS-3G\nsudo mv UserMap /mnt/.NTFS-3g/\n\n*You may need to unmount and remount the file system again to make this user mapping take effect.\nOnce this user mapping file is in place, your Ubuntu user account should have access to any files or folders owned by your Windows account, and any files you create in Ubuntu should look like they were created by your Windows account when you boot Windows.\n", "Q: Multiple ATI Graphics Cards I have a triple monitor setup on Nvidia currently, but after having a number of difficulties with the Nvidia drivers, I'm thinking about jumping ship to AMD graphics cards with Eyefinity.\nI would like the possibility to switch to a quad monitor setup down the road, assuming that the ATI drivers work reasonably after a few days of testing.

I got this output:\nfsck from util-linux 2.19.1\nfsck: fsck.ntfs: not found\nfsck: Error 2 while executing fsck.ntfs for /dev/sda1\n\nI can't find fsck.ntfs, and command-not-found doesn't help either. How can I make this error go away?\nBy the way, I've tried booting into Windows (XP) several times, thinking that Windows would repair the filesystems. But apparently Windows thinks the filesysystems are just fine. And it's odd that all NTFS filesystems are affected.\nAlso, I can work around this problem by dropping to a recovery shell and issuing mount -a, but for my coworkers' sakes I need unattended boot.\n\nA: If you have an NTFS partition automatically mounted at startup, the only reason could be you have manually or through some tool added it to /etc/fstab (not taking into account WUBI).\nIf the system tries to check the partition at startup it means that in the corresponding line in /etc/fstab there is a sixth field and its value is 1 or 2.\nntfsfix is not linked by default to fsck.ntfs, and it only provides limited check capabilities, as explained in the man page:\n\nntfsfix  is a utility that fixes some common NTFS problems.  ntfsfix is\n     NOT a Linux version of chkdsk.  It only repairs some  fundamental  NTFS\n     inconsistencies,  resets  the  NTFS  journal file and schedules an NTFS\n     consistency check for the first boot into Windows.\n\nThe common solution is not to create the symlink, but to remove or set to 0 the sixth field in /etc/fstab.\n\nA: Micro's answer worked for me, however my 11.10 (upgraded from 11.04) did not have ntfsprogs.  'sudo apt-get install ntfsprogs' solved that, then the link suggestion worked fine.\n\nA: fsck.ntfs is usually only a link to ntfsfix which is an utility from the package ntfsprogs that is already available with a standard installation of Ubuntu.\nYou can make a simbolic link between fsck.ntfs and ntfsfix to solve this permanently:\nsudo ln -s /usr/bin/ntfsfix /sbin/fsck.ntfs\nsudo ln -s /usr/bin/ntfsfix /sbin/fsck.ntfs-3g\n\nKeep in mind that this utility came from a reverse engineering process and are not the best option to manage your filesystem, the NTFS filesystem does not belong to the GNU/linux world.\n\nA: The problem is a missing symbolic link, to either /usr/bin/ntfsfix or /bin/ntfsfix. You can make the needed link(s) with:\nsudo ln -s $(which ntfsfix) /sbin/fsck.ntfs\nsudo ln -s $(which ntfsfix) /sbin/fsck.ntfs-3\n\n\nA: I think it could be noted for some people that ntfsfix gets installed into /bin/ instead of /usr/bin. So\nsudo ln -nsf /bin/ntfsfix /sbin/fsck.ntfs\nsudo ln -nsf /bin/ntfsfix /sbin/fsck.ntfs-3g\n\nIf you have already created the symlink from /usr/bin/\nsudo rm -f /sbin/fsck.ntfs\nsudo rm -f /sbin/fsck.ntfs-3g\n\nAnd then create the symlinks again.\n\nA: I have the same problem after I accidentally installed ntfsprogs.

What are the technical differences between the two?  The only thing I noticed is that\nsudo su\n\nrequires you to enter your own password (assuming you're not root)\nWhile\nsu root\n\nrequires you to enter root's password.  However both seem to log you into the root user account.\n\nA: There's a subtle difference between the two. su root (which can be shortened to just su) runs the su command as the user who invoked it. sudo runs the specified command (su) as root. Running su as root is essentially a no-op, though it probably starts a new shell. Running sudo -i is a cleaner (in my opinion) way of running sudo su.\nAlso, as pointed out previously, there is no root password on a default Ubuntu installation, so invoking su by itself will fail.\n\nA: The second command cannot be executed in a default Ubuntu installation, where the root account is not enabled.\nBut supposing you have unlocked the root account giving him a password, the two commands could only differ in the environment and shell variable set, I think. Compare the output of env in the two situations, and maybe also the output of set to see the differences.\n\nA: Another difference; the sudo command uses YOUR password and you have to be authorized in the /etc/sudoers file.  The sudoers file defines what commands you are allowed to execute using sudo.  The su command uses the ROOT password. which must be known.\nDepending on options you can pick up roots environment or carry yours forward.\nI use \"sudo bash\" to get a root shell.  That is almost identical (maybe is, I am not sure) to \"sudo -i\".  The environment is controlled like this \"sudo su - other_user\" gets the environment for other_user.  But \"sudo su other_user\" carries your environment forward under the UID of other_user.  That means your aliases and such will be available.\nAlso, auditing results are different in the audit logs when using su versus sudo.  More tracability with sudo.  Lastly, for su you give the root password around and have a maintenance pain.  If you authorize people with sudo, you just update the sudoers file to add or remove people and they only have to remember their own password.  Sudoers also allows you to decide what others can do.\n\nA: sudo -i\nis how you do it, at least from 11.00 on, not sure about previously or after 12.04.\narries your environment forward under the UID of other_user. as said previously\n", "Q: In KDE, how can I make totem the lowest priority program in all associated file types I just installed the ubuntu-desktop package on Kubuntu to try out unity, but now all my file associations have been stolen from my (painstakingly optimised) defaults (amarok, k3b, dragon player) to (factory default) things like totem, brasero and movie player.

Surely it should be possible to insert into the local USB but backup a file on the remote server? Is there some other way of accessing the drive locally?\n\nA: You may try remmina rdp client.\nI think it allows to use shared folders between the server and client.\n", "Q: How to remove module from kernel using -r or rmmod?

I would like to copy all recordings of a certain show to a folder so I can transfer them to another computer and watch them \"offline\". MythTV stores all recordings in a single folder in files titled \"2609_20111111093000.nuv\" which makes finding all the episodes I want a daunting task.\nI tried using MythArchive but it seemingly oriented at burning files to DVDs. In addition, my MythTV crashes when I try to use MythArchive. \nI'm not particularly concerned with converting/recompressing files, just copying them would be enough.\n\nA: mythnuv2mkv allows you to convert any .nuv to other standard formats with the ability to look in imdb for titles and other information about the files.\nI have not personally used it but it sounds very easy to use and the necessary tools (other than the script) are available for Ubuntu:\n\n\n*\n\n*mythtranscode - mythtv-transcode-utils (multiverse)\n\n*perl - perl (main)\n\n*mplayer - mplayer (multiverse or non-free(medibuntu))\n\n*mencoder - mencoder (multiverse or non-free(medibuntu))\n\n*wget - wget (main)\n\n*ImageMagick - imagemagick (main)\n\n*bc - bc (main)\n\n\nGive it a go and drop a comment if it does not do what you are looking for.\n\nA: Here's a solution I found, and it's nearly perfect:\n\n\n*\n\n*there's a standard MythTV script called mythlink.pl, which is able to create human-readable links to all recording files:\nmythlink.pl --link /mnt/pretty --format '%T/%T%-%S'\n\n\n*after the script created the links, I can use cp --dereference or, even better, Midnight Commander, to copy any files I want wherever I want with nice human-readable names.\n\nA: If you just need to show filenames in a human-readable format, without reconverting or copying them, you can get it and saving disk-space using the virtual filesystem MythVFS which can be installed via\nsudo apt-get install mythtvfs\n\nJust \"mount\" a virtual filesystem by configuring it in /etc/fstab and you'll see all your recording files with title, date, channel number or whatever you like in the filename.\nHere's an example on how I mount it via fstab:\nmythtvfs#/media/mythtv /media/VFS/mythtv fuse user,noauto,allow_other,uid=mythtv,gid=mythtv,host=localhost,format=%T-%S-(@%c-%s)_%f,date_format=%Y-%m-%d,datetime_format=%Y-%m-%d-h%H:%M 0 0\n\nwhere:\n/media/mythtv is my recording directory\n/media/VFS/mythtv is my MythTv VFS mountpoint\nmythtv is my MythTv's user (ad group) id\n\nA: Have you looked at Mythexport?\nI am not sure if it is still being worked on, as I have had a few issues with it. But I believe it would be what you are looking for.\nWith it you can schedule to have recordings transcoded to configurable encoding and it will move the export to a folder you configure. It also names the files to a human readable format.\n", "Q: Starting nodejs application on server start gives exit with code 2 I'm running the below on server startup:\nexec sudo -E -u www-data /usr/bin/node /etc/nodeserver/app.js >> /var/log/applicationserver.log 2>&1\n\nThe console writes many messages that the start exited with the code 2. The application is still started in the end.\nWhere can I find information about the exit codes for nodejs?\n\nA: I am not using node.js, so please take this with a grain of salt.\nHowever I looked up reserved exit codes for Unix in general, and Code 2 seems to be similar to Code 1 (general error).\nYou could try node with a trivial program, and therefore see if it also emits the same row of error messages. It could be the app.js that displays these messages. Does node have a man page? It generally includes the exit codes the program uses.\nAlso I've searched for ways to exit a process in node with an exit code, and the right way to do this seems to be the process object.\n\nA: I had the same error with /usr/sbin/node being used instead of /usr/bin/node.\nI just removed /usr/sbin/node\n", "Q: Compiz grid plugin places window on two virtual desktops When I use the \"Put Right\" function of the Compiz grid plugin to maximize a window on the right half of a desktop, a two-pixel stripe of the window ends up on the next virtual desktop just to the right. The window then appears on two desktops simultaneously, which is a bit inconvenient to handle. \"Put Left\" works fine, interestingly.\nI run 11.10 with unity. Any idea if that is a known bug?\n\nA: The Compiz Grid plugin has some difficulties with window geometry and especially right side edges. There are a few similar bug reports:\n\n\n*\n\n*windows near to the right edge of the screen inhibit the unity toolbar on the next rightmost screen\n\n*Grid plugin places windows incorrectly when dragged to right edge\nAnd for a collection: Launchpad Bug #774986\nI can confirm that I also get a 2px overlay on my right monitor by „putting a window right” on the left monitor.\n", "Q: How can I detect the BPM (beats per minute) of a song? For some activities such as running it is important to know how many BPM a song has. I know that Banshee can do this but I couldn't figure out how to do this for a selected range of songs.\nWhich tool can I use to detect the BPM and immediately tag this in the ID3 fiels of the corresponding files?\n\nA: There is a thread (Any beat detection software for Linux?) on SuperUser dealing with the same problem.\nIt uses a combination of commands (bpmcount, mid3v2, vorbiscomment, metaflac) compiled into a neat shell script.\n\nA: Mixxx has a built-in analyser that will let you select a bunch of songs from your library to analyse their BPM.\nI recommend using the latest version of Mixxx (1.11 at the time of writing) to make sure you get the most reliable analysis (it has been enhanced recently). You can use their PPA to always have the latest stable version.\nHowever, as mentioned by naught101 in the comments, the value is not yet saved in the file's tags as the development team needs to fix a memory corruption problem before it is enabled. Therefeore, my answer is only partial.\n\n\nA: bpm-tools are command-line tools for detecting and tagging BPM.\nHere's the man page of the package in Ubuntu 14.04 LTS.\nYou could use a loop or xargs in a shell script to run this on a library of songs.\n\nA: SongKong (pro version) can calculate the BPM of over a million songs as they are matched to MusicBrainz.  It updates your iTunes folders in real time.\n\nA: Banshee has an option for detecting BPM.\nAnd if you only want to detect the BPM for a select range of songs, open their proprties dialogs, go to the Extra tab and click on the Detect button.\n\n", "Q: Extremely slow internet wired connection in Asus x101h, Ubuntu 11.10 My ethernet connection is very slow (it was also with 11.04). It works fine with another PC with XP. Also, WIFI is OK in Ubuntu. \nI've checked several help pages, but nothing seems to work:\nThe connection is slow for the Update Manager too, so the Firefox settings I changed obviously did nothing.\nIt is not the IPv6 (set to Ignore) either. The IPv4 method set to Automatic (DHCP) doesn't work at all. In manual method, with addresses and DNS copied from my other computer:\nAddress: 192.168.1.156\nNetmask: 255.255.255.0\nGateway: 192.168.1.1\nDNS servers: 203.176.128.10,203.176.128.11\nIt establishes a connection but then it is really slow. Sometimes it works fine for brief periods of time, then stops again. \nI also updated the BIOS.\n... and also installed bind9.\nI'm connected to a apartments building's connection, so I don't have access to the router, etc.\nThe ethernet controller is Atheros AR8152 v2.0 (rev c1). At the network information it says that the driver is \"atl1c\", which I also updated (or installed, I'm not sure now).\nMy wife is getting really pissed off and I don't know where else to look.\nAny help would be appreciated.\n\nA: I believe what Igarzo is trying to do is to help you eliminate different problem areas.\nTo use his method you would either have to buy or make a \"Crossover\" Cat5 cable or purchase one as you will be connecting two like devices (computer ethernet port to another computer ethernet port).\nTo use a normal Cat5 patch cable will not work as the wiring is done differently (don't use the same one you connect your computer to the ethernet/broadband port).\nIn addition you will need to configure both IP addresses manually for both connected machines to something like 192.168.0.1 for the first machine and 192.168.0.2 for the second which defaults to a subnet mask of 255.255.255.0 if I remember right.\nKeep in mind that if you are trying to send the files back and forth between a Linux machine and a Windows machine you may have to have Samba or the like installed on the Linux machine.\nIf the two machines transfer files at descent speeds, then you can rule out the machine(s) themselves as the blame. If the file transfer still resembles the speed of which you were getting having it hooked into the Internet then you may be looking at a driver, software or firewall issue.\nIf you have a firewall installed on your Linux machine you may want to check it's restrictions to be sure it's not bottle-necking your speed. Another area to check would to be sure that programs such as torrent downloaders are not running in the background sucking up bandwidth on either machine as one can impact the whole network when connected simultaneously.\nIf you don't wan't to do without the torrent manager, you can go inside most torrent managers settings and turn down the upload and download speeds to allow more bandwidth for other tasks (just remember not to set either to \"0\" as most torrent managers recognize this as unlimited bandwidth allocated.\nLast but not least would be to make sure you are using the right or appropriate drivers for your network interface card or NIC.\nAlso this address has diagrams of what a crossover cable should look like at it's terminations. If you have a normal cable handy you can look closely at it's ends and see that the ends match in color order as opposed to a crossover cable.\nHope this information helps.\n\nA: In that case it could very well be a driver issue. Open your \"Dash Home\" in Ubuntu and type in \"additional drivers\". Click on the option and see if there is an option or up to date driver to install regarding your ethernet card.\n", "Q: Screen turns gray on boot after install of a PPA Problem\nI recently added ppa:eugenesan/ppa to my maverick installation to install smartgit. Right after apt-get listed a bunch of updates that I immediately installed. After rebooting I noticed that grub changed. The new version of grub is 1.99~rc1-2ubuntu1~eugenesan~maverick1. Booting up my system I had to admit that it no longer launches the login screen. It still shows the Ubuntu logo (new style also) but after that the screen turns gray.\nSolution ideas\nI already found the apt-get history under /var/log/apt/history.log and it lists all the software that came with the new repository. The list is huge.\nFurther, I read that ppa-purge can uninstall a repository and all its software. I am not sure if I understood right since it does not affect the grub version installed. That would be the easiest to see.\nCan you help me to fix my system? I have access to the command line.\n\nVague solution steps\nThanks to Lekensteyn. In the meantime I read and tried what was written in the other thread. Nonetheless, I cannot uninstall the software version that came by eugenesan. This is what I tried:\nsudo ppa-purge ppa:eugenesan/ppa\nrm /etc/apt/sources.list.d/eugenesan...\n\nMoreover, I found out that a \"Previous Linux version\" boots up normally. The default grub entries are Ubuntu, with Linux 2.6.35-31-generic and ..(recovery mode) - the couple that does not boot up.\nBut when I choose Ubuntu, with Linux 2.6.35-30-generic from the list, everything works fine. Do you understand what happens? Could it be that the graphic resolution is just set wrong OR do you think grub is the problem?\nInstallation log\nTo give a complete overview I got the history.log for apt-get.

This is the default behaviour when your NTFS partition is auto-mounted.\nTo solve this issue first identify the device file for your NTFS partition. It will be in /dev directory so the complete file name would be something like /dev/sdaX. You can find this using Disk Utility. After this create a directory in your home directory and unmount your NTFS partition using the following command:\nsudo umount /dev/sdaX\n\nnow remount it using the following command to have write access to it:\nsudo mount -t ntfs -o rw,auto,user /dev/sdaX /home/tintin/DIRECTORY_NAME\n\n\nA: I usually mount my ntfs partitions with the options:\ndefaults,rw,user,uid=myusername,gid=mygroupname\nOf course this is assuming a single-user system. ^^\n\nA: Following the basic advice above I created \nsudo mount -t ntfs -o rw,auto,user /dev/sda6 /Information\n\nso I can mount as wanted. I like it this way because many of the files there are very important to me, so not having automatic access is just another layer of protection.\n", "Q: Different printing setting in Gnome Shell and in Unity Why are the printing setting different in Gnome Shell and Unity for Ubuntu 11.10?\nI believe this may even be a bug - more than a question. But I want to refine my questions before posting them at Launchpad.\nUnder Ubuntu 11.10, Unity had a printing menu that looks like this: \nYet in the Shell, it looks rather like this: \nI've connected my laptop, a Dell Inspiron 1525, to my University's wireless printing system (LPD). It was very simple under Ubuntu 10.04, and also after upgrading to Ubuntu 11.10. it was quite easy well. \nThe problem is - under Unity it worked out-of-the-box (just as it was in 10.04), yet under Gnome Shell it didn't. \nFurthermore, printing under Shell doesn't send it to print, yet under Unity it prints just fine..\nI like both DE - but prefer Shell as of today. Why is the printing issue different..?\n\nA: A nice way to get around this is to make the old printer settings launcher visible in Gnome Shell is to edit the launcher directly:\nsudo nano /usr/share/applications/system-config-printer.desktop\n\nand change the line NotShowIn=KDE;Gnome; to NotShowIn=KDE;.\nAlso, as Timo mentioned above, the name of the new and the old printer settings launchers may be the same, so you may also want to change the line Name=Printers to something like Name=Advanced Printer Settings.\n\nA: You're actually looking at two separate applications. The screenshot at the top is system-config-printer (called \"Printing\" in the shell) and the screenshot at the bottom is gnome-printers-panel (called \"Printers\" -- but they may have the same name in your language!). Both are available in both desktop environments.\nThe latter one is probably supposed to replace the former in Gnome 3, but as you have noticed, it isn't as functional as the old one (yet). That explains why both are installed.\nI can't explain why printing doesn't work in Gnome Shell. Do you still experience problems if you use system-config-printer to set up your printer in Gnome Shell?\n\nA: Unity and Gnome Shell are not different desktop environments. For  both, the DE is Gnome 3, and the configuration of printing and other system things should be done using the same dialogs with both. They're not supposed to provide different configuration tools. \nHowever, the transition to Gnome 3 is not 100% complete. I'm not entirely sure why, but Ubuntu seems to have overridden the new printing dialog, using the old one instead. This is a weird bug that I can confirm. I would assume that there is something in the session definitions that are missing something, and I would be seriously surprised if there was an actual issue with Unity and Gnome Shell themselves. But since the \"gnome-shell\" package provides the Gnome session, you should still file a bug at that package. In other words, I can confirm that clicking on \"printers\" in gnome-control-center when you run it from the \"Gnome\" session is different than doing the exact same thing from the \"Ubuntu\" session. No doubt it is a bug, but I don't know the cause of it. \nAs a temporary fix, in order to run the correct dialog while in the Gnome session, press alt+f2 and enter /usr/share/system-config-printer/system-config-printer.py\n\nA: @Timo Kluck the gnome shell configure app is invoked with: gnome-control-center printers\nYou can edit the printers in gnome shell by running system-config-printer changes are carried across desktop environments.\nBut it is a problem that needs to be rectified. \n", "Q: How to monitor what Ubuntu One is doing? Is there a way to monitor what Ubuntu One is doing when it seems to be chewing up so much network bandwidth?  I'd like to see what files it's syncing.

Once you have confirmed that the trunk is working correctly without the complexity of A2Billing in the way, then you can move on to sorting out A2Billing.\nYou may consider paid support from www.Star2Billing.com, or free support on the A2Billing forums, http://forum.asterisk2billing.org/.\n", "Q: Libreoffice theme integration not working (Xubuntu) I am running Xubuntu 11.10 and everything works nicely.

I installed Ubuntu using wubi on hp dv6-6135dx.\nWhen I boot into Ubuntu, I get a black screen. \nThe wireless light turns blue after a while, meaning Ubuntu has loaded the driver, but the screen stays turned off.\nWhen I first booted into Wubi I got a black screen with white screen with text that said \n\ngenerating locales... done. Warning: Not compatible with locale\n  us.uTF8....\n\nIt stayed stuck at this screen, so I hard shut down the computer after about a half hour. \nNow wubi won't boot. I'm considering dual-booting, but will Ubuntu actually start? Can Ubuntu mess up my Windows 7 installation?\n\nA: If Ubuntu works on a LiveCD, it will likely work when you dual boot. Ubuntu cannot mess your Windows installation up unless you do it incorrectly.\nTo install it correctly, resize the Windows partition from within Windows 7. Do this by using the device manager (right click My Computer, click device manager, and then use the disk management section).\nWhen you boot the LiveCD and go to the installation screen, it will offer to install alongside Windows 7. Use that option and you should have no further issues, and it will offer to boot Windows on startup.\n\nIf you have a Windows 7 DVD, and later want to restore the boot loader for Window 7, you can also do that, but you wouldn't be able to load Ubuntu in that case.\n\nUbuntu cannot harm your computer btw.\n\nA: The dual boot option will work for you, but there are a few considerations.\nFirst, is that you have to resize your hard drive partitions, which, if you've got a newish machine, shouldn't be too challenging.  The windows disk manager can be used, but I recommend using an application to handle it, like Partition Magic ($) or GParted (Free).\nNext, GRUB is installed by default, but should you choose to roll back, you may need to fix the Master Boot Record in Windows Safe Mode.  That can be a pain, but ultimately it's fixed quickly.\nFinally, you may still end up with driver issues.  Wubi isn't new, but it has it's challenges with newer hardware, as you know.  This is less of an issue with the traditional installation since there isn't another layer that the OS has to use to access the hardware.  The more generic drivers will get you through.\nUltimately, to answer your question, it won't hurt your computer, but I'd make sure I have a recent backup and Win7 restore partition or install dvd handy should anything happen.\n", "Q: Need driver for Alps touchpad on a Vaio F2 VPCF2190X that supports Multi-touch I have a Sony Vaio VPCF2190X with an Alps Multi-touch trackpad, and I can't use multi-touch.

Specifically, the selected option is \"Allow connections only from computers running Remote Desktop with Network Level Authentication.\"\nOn my Ubuntu system, I tried using Remmina to connect to the Windows server. Remmina can not connect to that server with the option \"Network Level Authentication\" (as mentioned in the previous paragraph). The error message Remmina returns is as follows:\nDisable the connection to the server RPD: IPWINDOWSSERVER2008\n\nHow can I connect Remmina (or another program) by remote desktop to a Windows Server 2008 host with the \"Network Level Authentication\" option selected?\n\nA: As of Ubuntu 12.04, you can use Remmina to connect to Windows servers with Network Level Authentication enabled.\nsudo apt-get -y install remmina\n\nRemmina uses FreeRDP for RDP connections and NLA support was added to FreeRDP in version 1.0, which is available to Ubuntu 12.04 and above. If you happen to be using an earlier version of Ubuntu and cannot upgrade, here's an updated version of remmina here, although I can't vouch for its stability: https://launchpad.net/~freerdp-team/+archive/freerdp\nIf that doesn't work, you might be able to connect directly:  \n\n\n*\n\n*Install the above PPA\nsudo apt-add-repository ppa:freerdp-team/freerdp  \n\n*Install the freerdp package:\nsudo apt-get install freerdp  \n\n*xfreerdp --plugin cliprdr -g 1024x768 -k no -u {username} -d {domain-name} {target-machine}\nIf you do the latter, you can can always create an alias in ~/.bash_aliases:\nalias rdp='xfreerdp --plugin cliprdr -g 1152x864 -k no -u username -d DOMAIN'\n\nA: I solved this issue by right clicking on the entry in Remmina, going to edit, clicking on the advanced tab, and then changing the security field to \"RDP\" from \"Negotiate\"\n\nA: New command formatting\nAfter my last update, I got confronted with FreeRDP 1.2.0 (probably it changed already with version 1.0.2 - and got though also relevant for most Ubuntu users). Its protocol changed how to connect. Try the following example:\nxfreerdp /u:<username> /v:<hostname> /size:<WxH>\n\nAdditional features\nThere are a lot of features you might want to discover on the development page https://github.com/FreeRDP/FreeRDP/wiki/CommandLineInterface\n\nA: I know this is old but I had same problem in 12.04 remmina and solution was setting security to RDP. I don't know why \"auto\" doesn't work.\n\nA: I solved problem on 13.04 with setting TLS when connecting to Windows 2008 R2 Enterprise server. Auto-negotiation didn't work. \n\nA: I was unable to connect with remmina, finally tried freerdp from the command line:\nxfreerdp [serverip]\n\nI was prompted for my password, then received the message that the host key for this IP had changed. I deleted the known_hosts file (~.freerdp/known_hosts) and remmina was able to connect.\n\nA: It doesn't work with NLA for me either. You can set the Windows Remote Desktop to the middle option (without Network Level Authentication) and then it works.\nIf you are on a local area network and ports are behind a firewall for the outside world, it shouldn't be too insecure.\n\nA: Have you tried using Wine?\nDL this and run it on wine.

If the fingerprint differs, you can change it to the new one.\nOf course, You should double-check that the fingerprint is correct and not manipulated. If you are within a secure environment, you may alternatively delete the belonging line in known_hosts. A new one will appear during the next connection.\n\nA: I set the security option to 'negotiate' instead of 'NLA' and directly got me connected.\nBefore that I was not able to connect with proper credentials.

It is hard to access her computer, so a seamless upgrade would be very nice...\n\nA: Don't think it's going to break, especially given the fact that the version of Gnome3 in 12.04 will remain the same, 3.2.\nThat said, I wouldn't recommend telling your mother to upgrade on her own. Plan in advance, and do it yourself, so that if something does break, you can take care of it.

(It works only within the best-fit mode, when switching to 50% or something similar it does not work).\nTo change modes click the box displaying the zoom percentage.\n\nA: There is a weird interaction between \"scroll continuously\" and \"zoom\" here.  If you have \"scroll continuously\" off, then the action of the mouse-scroll wheel (or arrow keys) depends on the zoom level.\nIf zoom level is \"fit page\" or lower (in %), then you can scroll through pages.  If zoom level is above that (even though it may look like the page fits onto the screen fine), the mouse-wheel scrolls only within a page, and the only way to get to other pages seems to be to enter the page number in the text box at top right.

Application along those lines are FreeNX or NeatX by google. Apparently in 11.10, it is now easier to use x2go (see here for some installation instructions).\nAll of these remote-desktop setups require a bit more setting up. For instance you need a suitable client on the connecting side.

However when I run this command I get:\n-f: command not found\n\nIt appears as though the time command is not reading the -f as an argument, rather as the command I am trying to run.\nHow can I get the execution time for a command in a specific format?\n\nA: Unfortunately, time is both a bash keyword and a program in /usr/bin.  If you specify the full path to time like:\n/usr/bin/time -f \"%E\" ls -l\n\nYou will get the output you were expecting.\n\nA: This is because time is a bash builtin command - and the builtin doesn't support the options you're trying to use.\nTry this, use the full path of time to skip the built-in and use the real one:\n/usr/bin/time -f \"%E\" ls -l\n\n\nA: to change format of bash builtin time use TIMEFORMAT variable\nTIMEFORMAT\n      The  value  of  this parameter is used as a format string specifying how the timing information for pipelines prefixed with the time reserved word should be displayed.  The % character introduces an escape sequence that is expanded to a time value or\n      other information.  The escape sequences and their meanings are as follows; the braces denote optional portions.\n      %%        A literal %.\n      %[p][l]R  The elapsed time in seconds.\n      %[p][l]U  The number of CPU seconds spent in user mode.\n      %[p][l]S  The number of CPU seconds spent in system mode.\n      %P        The CPU percentage, computed as (%U + %S) / %R.\n\n      The optional p is a digit specifying the precision, the number of fractional digits after a decimal point.  A value of 0 causes no decimal point or fraction to be output.  At most three places after the decimal point may be  specified;  values  of  p\n      greater than 3 are changed to 3.  If p is not specified, the value 3 is used.\n\n      The optional l specifies a longer format, including minutes, of the form MMmSS.FFs.  The value of p determines whether or not the fraction is included.\n\n      If this variable is not set, bash acts as if it had the value $'\\nreal\\t%3lR\\nuser\\t%3lU\\nsys\\t%3lS'.  If the value is null, no timing information is displayed.

Anyone know if Ubuntu supports AMD Radeon HD 6490M or 6750M? \n\nA: The question is not if Ubuntu supports your hardware or not, it is more if your hardware builder has made any drivers for your hardware to be usable in Linux.\nThe Radeon HD 6750 is officially supported by ATI's Catalyst drivers and the xserver-xorg-video-ati open source drivers. \nThe Radeon HD 6750M will work even tough you will find your self with a watermark on the right bottom corner of the screen saying your hardware is not supported. That can be fixed following some simple steps.\nThe Radeon HD 6490 or the 6490M are not officially supported by ATI's Catalyst drivers but the open source xserver-xorg-video-ati driver should work without a problem.\nThe xserver-xorg-video-ati open source driver will be installed by default once your card is detected, the performance in not au pair with the closed driver but really big improvements are done with each release so its definitely an option.\nYou can easily toogle between the open source xserver-xorg-video-ati driver and the closed driver by following these steps.\n\nA: [EDIT BELOW, it works!]\nShort note to say that I never got my Chronos 7 working with fglrx drivers.  I've tried Oneiric and Precise, with catalyst 11.2 and more recently 12.1.  Currently I have the drivers installed, but I have to delete my xorg.conf in order to get a desktop, which dumps me to a Unity-2d session.  My driver, according to my system settings, is blank, which I presume means that I'm on Intel.\nIf I uninstall the drivers, I get a Unity 3D session using the Intel driver, but then the ATI card runs at full speed constantly, driving the fans at full speed.\nOther issues - no control over the backlit keyboard (it's always on), screens brightness resets to full on startup, ignoring your choice/amendments in the display settings and finally, as it's a buttonless trackpad, you'll need to make some tweaks (https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/linux/+bug/582809) in order to get it working.  It's also incredibly insensitive, so you'll have to tweak it again with \nsynclient FingerLow=3\nsynclient FingerHigh=8\n\nevery login to make it usable without pressing the full pad of your finger in order to move the mouse.\nSuspend/resume, WIFI, sound and 1600x900 resolution, however, all work fine.\nThis laptop is NOT a good choice for Ubuntu. Unity-2d is startlingly poor - no customisation options, so you'll get the whole \"FisherPrice\" experience - but necessary unless you can put up with the noise of the fans blasting full time.\nEDIT :\nI did eventually get this laptop working reasonably well. FGLRX did install in the end.  Despite the multi-arch status of Precise, I ended up doing a sudo apt-get install ia32-libs which then installs a multitude of \"redundant\" packages. Can't tell if that's really what did the trick, but un-installing FGLRX after that, then re-installing (using the \"additional drivers\" in system settings and choosing the stable drivers) appeared to do the trick. You also have to link /usr/lib64 to /usr/lib, or the sudo amdconfig --px-dgpu command will fail.\nSo, what's wrong now? The trackpad still needs the synclient changes and doesn't support click-n-drag although two-finger scrolling is good, as is two-finger tap for right-click. The keyboard backlight is always on and unconfigurable. The brightness of the screen will often reset on boot up to full power. There was also an issue with Pulseaudio, but I think that will be resolved now - certainly the fix on that bug report got me working, as you can see on comment 24.\nSo conversely then, it's fast, quiet (unless you're playing a game), high resolution, light (for its size), and the battery lasts around 4 hours with light usage (mid-brightness, WIFI on, Bluetooth on, web browsing mainly).\nIn summary, it's hard work, but a cracking laptop once you get it working.

But if anyone knows a not-too-complicated way, please do not hold back. :)\n\nA: If you only need to sync between Firefox and Chrome, you can use Google Bookmarks and the GMarks add-on for Firefox. Just put your current bookmarks in Chrome into Google Bookmarks, and then when using Firefox, install the GMarks add-on. GMarks will allow you to use your Google Bookmarks in Firefox.\nAnother alternative could be using Netvouz.\n\nNetvouz is a social bookmarking service that allows you to save your\n  favorite links online and access them from any computer, wherever you\n  are.

With htop I see that the CPU isn't asked very much. \nWhat could be the reason?\nThanks!\n\nA: Audacious is not reach in features but is not light.

How to install see here in my blog. It looks like that.\nYour expression \"even cooler than Windows\" struck me : UBUNTU is meant to be THAT too.

See this article. \n", "Q: Which graphics driver set is better to test in the long run? So, my computer has a Radeon mobility card and Compiz doesn't seem to want to play nice with it. The nets me a tradeoff: I can use the proprietary drivers and get the boosted performance and take a hit to several usability items, or I can use the \"standard\" drivers and take the hit to performance in favor of everything working properly.\nI also happen to do a lot of alpha testing on a spare partition on this machine. This leaves me wondering, which driver should I be using? Is it more important to get the \"standard\" drivers to actually perform better? Or should I be filing bugs against Unity because it doesn't work with the proprietary set properly? Or both.\nWhat do developers suggest that I run to benefit the project more in the long term? Regardless of what type of graphics card is used. Or is that a factor in what set should be used?\n\nA: If you want to help contributing to the further development and support of drivers for Ubuntu, assigning, supporting and contributing for the fixing of bugs on both versions is the way to go. Both are important, but you need to differentiate between what is really in your hands.\nClosed driver means just that, it's closed. You can say that Unity is broken because of the closed driver, but in the end, if the driver does not work, there is not much to do. Testing is done on the official releases, but it does not mean it will work for everyone.\nI have to say I do not believe that the open-source driver's performance will ever be as good as the closed driver, but talking about Ubuntu and Linux, we want to have at least the alternative to have our hardware running under minimum conditions with an open-source driver.\nWe want to make sure that, given the option, a user will be able to run Unity without many glitches on the closed-source driver, but most importantly is that an open-source, well-built and stable driver is available.\nWith the closed driver, you can open bugs, complaints, support others in reporting data to fix any issues, but in the end, it will be the builder's responsibility to lay the path for the driver's development.\nOn the other hand, the closed driver is largely supported, bugs are taken more directly serious, development is done but also bug fixing is implemented on case by case situation. The open-source community works hard for it to work as good as it can get and with as less issues as possible.\nYour time is valuable reporting issues in Unity running with the closed driver, but IMHO, the open-source driver deserves it much more and you will get more value for your effort supporting it.\n\nA: As one of the Ubuntu X maintainers I can say: testing on both the open-source and proprietary drivers is valuable; we have lots of users of both, and it's important the Unity runs well on both the free stack and the proprietary stack.\nHowever, if you want your testing to have the biggest impact, testing the free stack would be the way to go - at least for AMD cards.\nThe open-source radeon driver has a reasonable set of developers - it's not large and can always do with more, but it's supported by AMD. Barring the influx of hundreds of full-time developers these drivers won't achieve the same performance as fglrx, but it's entirely possible they'll achieve 90-95% of the performance; it's the last couple of percent that's extremely expensive.\nThey're also much easier to improve - because they're open-source, we have visibility into fixes and can much more easily justify fixing bugs in stable releases.  With the fglrx driver we just get a code-dump mixing features and fixes, with unknown regression potential. This makes it difficult for us to update the proprietary drivers in a stable release.\nFinally, there's more prospect of improvement for radeon than for fglrx. Radeon developers care about the whole desktop stack, fglrx is largely targetted at workstation users.\nFor nouveau the answer is a bit murkier. There's still more prospect of improvements in nouveau than nvidia - again, nvidia is largely targetted at the workstation market - but nouveau has a harder time making progress than radeon, as they additionally need to reverse-engineer everything.\nAll this applies mostly to bugs rather than performance.  It's generally harder to generate a good performance bug than it is to generate a good crash or incorrect rendering bug. Rendering and crash bugs are generally isolated to a small section of code, whereas performance problems generally involve a whole stack of code. Where you find isolated performance problems they can be worthwhile to report, but that's not the common case.\nIn short, performance problems generally require active effort to identify - you're unlikely to stumble across an actionable performance problem.  Bugs - both crashers and misrendering - you can easily identify during normal use.\n", "Q: Is there a program that can loop a youtube video?

I know vlc can do this (go to the playlist view for looping controls) but others might also work. Note that other video players may need you to install some additional codecs in order to be able to play .flv files.\n\n\nA: you can play any youtube video with vlc. vlc <url of the video>\nif you go into vlc preferences, all preferences, and then playlist, tick the box repeat current item\nthen it will loop any video you play.\nafter you do that go to the terminal, and play your specific video:\nvlc http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pmfHHLfbjNQ\n\nit will keep looping. :)\n\nA: i recently find this site https://www.youtuberpt.com, it gives you a simple way how to loop youtube videos and create custom playlist with part of your favorite videos, maybe it will help others who was trying to find something like this.

Everything was working just fine and then suddenly one of the group chat windows, to a group chat I always use, goes missing. I of course go to reopen it by double clicking the entry in the history list, but that does nothing. I try the same thing on another group chat's entry/row in the history list and that group chat's window comes right up. \nI look around my workspaces for a while, trying to get to it. I try clicking on an event notification (window) when someone in the group chat types something (because this normally brings up the group chat window) and nothing. I try tinkering with the settings. I try closing Skype and opening it again. I try uninstalling and reinstalling Skype. I try uninstalling, rebooting and then reinstalling again.\nPerplexed, I decide to install CompizConfig Settings Manager after reading it allows the user to move windows. (My thinking was that the group chat window might be opening up in some unreachable space and I can move it to the center of my screen with the CompizConfig key combo.) I try it to no avail, although it works great with all windows I can see.\nAt this point I am starting to really accept that something is seriously wrong with some information that Skype is storing for the group chat and that the window just does not launch. \nMy next idea to fix this is to reset all local Skype settings, but I am not sure how. Is there a hidden folder in my home directory or something?\n\nA: Okay I figured it out.\nSkype stores user settings in ~/.Skype, so what I did was uninstall Skype, then in a shell, in my home directory:\nmv .Skype skype_backup\n\nI then reinstalled Skype and my \"broken\" group chat window now comes up!\nI will probably just delete that skype_backup, but I will keep it around for a little while to be safe.\n", "Q: How do I copy over settings from persistent usb to installation on harddrive? so i just installed Ubuntu 11.10 to my main hard drive. i have a couple of questions. \nthe main question being, how do i copy over all the programs and settings from the persistent usb that i got settled in with, to the new hard drive install?\nsecond question/scenario: i had a 160gig as my main. power flickered on and off really rapidly the other day. pc is fine, slaved 40 gig was fine, but now the 160gig sounds like it has sand in when i shake it. pc wont recognize it at all. so i've made the 40 gig my main for now. i have another 20 gig, but cant get them to both be recognized by the comp. tried putting them on two different IDE cables. i'm a little confused on what i should have the jumpers set to. i tried setting the 40 gig's jumper to Master, and the 20 gig to Slave, but the pc doesn't like it. basically what i'm asking for is some advice on the jumper settings. both of these are small, old drives. that 20 gigs more is a blessing on this old piece of junk. could really use some advice please. \n\nA: Copy your installed applications with\nOn your persistent install.\nsudo dpkg --get-selections > packages.list\n\nTransfer packages.list to your new install, and run\nsudo dpkg --get-selections < packages.list\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get dselect-upgrade\n\nSettings varies.

I'm running Ubuntu 11.10 via LiveUSB, and connect to the internet via a WiFi connection. I know it's not the connection itself because other laptops manage to connect and surf the web.

Specifically myriad.\n\nA: I realize this is Ubuntu Q&A, but since this answer was so helpful and applied also for both CentOS and Fedora Linux, let me add this:  I've installed a Windows APL interpreter to run under wine, and of course, APL uses (and really needs!) the specialized APL fonts.  Wine 2.0.1 (latest stable ver.) was compiled from source, and on a CentOS 6.6 box, (Linux kernel: 2.6.32-504.el6.i686) using Gnome 2.28.2 Xwindows desktop, I just copied the Apl*.ttf font files into the wine fonts directory ../wine/wine-2.0.1/fonts, the directory which is created when the wine source tarball is unpacked.  Worked fine.  But on an older Fedora kernel (Linux kernel: 2.6.27 25-78.2.56.fc9.i686), also with Gnome ( 2.22.3), when I compiled and built wine, I had to put the APL fonts into the ~/.wine/drive_c/windows/Fonts directory, for the APL interpreter to see them.  That is the user directory that is created when wine is first run.  In both cases, wine runs well, and the APL interpreter can see the specialized fonts it needs.\n\nA: Wine gets its fonts from four places:\n\n\n*\n\n*The standard system fonts at /usr/share/fonts.  You can add fonts here by installing font packages from Software Center, if they're available. Avoid manually copying files here.\n\n*Wine's private /usr/share/wine/fonts folder. You shouldn't add fonts here, but if you see a font in Wine and not in the system - it's probably here. Examples of these fonts include Wine's private marlett, symbol, and tahoma fonts, which are needed for application compatibility but otherwise aren't the best.\n\n*The ~/.fonts folder in your Home directory. This is where you should manually copy self-installed fonts, either downloaded from the Internet or copied from a Windows install.\n\n*The equivalent of the C:\\Windows\\Fonts folder within the current Wine prefix.   Unless you specified the WINEPREFIX environment variable when running Wine, This will generally be located in ~/.wine/drive_c/Windows/fonts.\n\n\nIn the case of conflicts (eg you install the real Tahoma font into your home directory), Wine is smart enough about it and uses the manually-installed ones.\n\nA: If you used PlayOnLinux:\n~/.PlayOnLinux/wineprefix/YOURPROGRAM/drive_c/windows/Fonts\n\nRestart application and test again.\n\nA: Wine says here\n\nFont configuration, once a nasty problem, is now much simpler. If you have a collection of TrueType fonts in Windows it's simply a matter of copying the .ttf files into c:\\windows\\fonts.\n\n\nA: Another option is to install PlayOnLinux which by default after starting it will install several of the Microsoft fonts (Am guessing also found in winetricks).\n", "Q: How to change kernel order in boot menu \nPossible Duplicate:\nHow do I change the grub boot order? \n\nI have 4 kernels in my grub.

When trying to install it, surprisingly I saw that it didn't detect my Windows 7 HP SP1.\nI have this windows pre-installed on my net-book.\ncan anyone help me with this problem?\n\nA: It is indeed fairly common that a laptop or netbook that has Win7 on it already has 4 primary partitions on the drive.\nI can't say for sure that this is your problem, but let's assume it is.\nIf you can see there is an option in the installer missing, then you can presumably boot into the live environment. That is the \"try without changing\" option.\nDo that and start Gparted. That is a partitioning program that can tell you what is on your drive. Have a look and see how many partitions there are. On a Win7 install, I gather it is fairly common to have\n2 partitions that are directly related to the Win7 install\nA recovery partition\nA partition containing tools from the manufacturer of the laptop.\nI don't remember exactly, but I think I blitzed the recovery partition on this netbook to make room for an extended partition to enable me to make logical partitions for the Ubuntu install. That is the principle, at any rate. Have a look what is there, maybe use the \"create a recovery medium\" facility (I didn't), and decide which of the existing partitions you can afford to get rid of.\nIf there really are already 4 primary partitions on the drive, then you do have to get rid of one of them in order to install anything else on there.

You also need a GTK+ theme (for the windows), a window theme (for the borders & window buttons) and a new icon theme. \nSome packages obtainable from custom PPAs contain all of these, but most of the time you will have to pick them yourself. You can set each of these in the gnome-tweak-tool in the same tab where you changed your shell theme.\nHere are some neat ppas that I use:\nSatays ppa: https://launchpad.net/~satyajit-happy/+archive/themes (deviantART)\nThe one and only best icon-theme is Faenza: https://launchpad.net/~tiheum/+archive/equinox\nWebupd8 also maintains a nice theme ppa: https://launchpad.net/~webupd8team/+archive/themes/+packages (Announcement)\n", "Q: How to get GTK3 checkboxes in certain themes? Xubuntu 11.10 introduces some GTK3 applications which don't play well with GTK2 themed apps. Base GTK3 theme is quite ugly, so I tried a couple of themes with both gtk2/3 components like \"Elegant Brit\" or \"Evolve\". I noticed that the checkboxes are missing in quite a lot of these themes. One only sees a very slight hover effect over the checkable line, but no box. The check-mark is visible though.\nFor example: Audacious with Elegant Brit theme:\n\nIs there an easy way (a simple line in some configfile) to get the checkboxes back? Maybe point me to a good guide to GTK themeing? \nIs there a program to switch GTK3 themes (NOT gnome-tweak-tool, which grabs the whole gnome-shell as dependency)?\n\nA: \n\"Is there a program to switch GTK3 themes (NOT gnome-tweak-tool, which\n  grabs the whole gnome-shell as dependency)?\"\n\nI use Lubuntu 11.10. To set a GTK3 theme :\nsudo ln -s /usr/share/theme/GTK3Theme/gtk-3.0 ~/.config/gtk-3.0\n\n\nA: NOT gnome-tweak-tool, which grabs the whole gnome-shell as dependency\nFALSE:\nsudo apt-get install gnome-tweak-tool --no-install-recommends\n", "Q: Difference between menu shutdown and 'shutdown -h now' What is the difference between the shutdown menu item and shutdown -h now?\nThe former sometimes hangs up my laptop on Ubuntu 11.10.\n\nA: The menu calls a complicated set of freedesktop.org specifications that shut down the system without the user needing to be root. You can see some of these on this answer. This method checks for open documents and blocking applications in the graphical interface before eventually calling for a system halt (via shutdown).\nRunning shutdown directly just shuts the computer down - regardless of what's running.\nIf the first isn't working, there's probably something blocking it. I'm not an expert in how it works so I suggest you file a bug on LaunchPad and let somebody who does know how it works step you through the debug process.\n\nA: The shutdown menu item requests the graphical system to shutdown cleanly. Programs that have files to save, for example, have an opportunity to ask the user what to do.\nshutdown -h now (synonym: poweroff; see also reboot) merely sends signals to all running programs. They don't have a chance to query the user if they have unsaved files. However, sending the poweroff command will work in more situations because of this.\n\nA: shutdown the system in a safe way. You can shutdown the machine immediately, or schedule a shutdown using 24 hour format.\nAfter bringing down the system, shutdown command halts or reboots the system according to the option that is specified. Only root user can execute shutdown command\n-r  Requests that the system be rebooted after it has been brought down\n-h  Requests that the system be either halted or powered off after it has been broughtdown, with the choice as to which left up to the system\n-H  Requests that the system be halted after it has been brought down\n-P  Requests that the system be powered off after it has been brought down\n-c  Cancels a running shutdown. TIME is not specified with this option, the firstargument is MESSAGE\n-k  Only send out the warning messages and disable logins, do not actually bring thesystem down\n\n", "Q: How to obtain installed package files? I need to download all packages I already installed on Ubuntu 11.10 x64. There should be in /var/cache/apt/archives I know, but there are only 300 Mb of deb files.

I have a working VPN connection using NetworkManager, OpenConnect, and the network-manager-openconnect-gnome package, but I have to start it manually every time I connect to a network, and I have to enter my password manually each time.\nHow can I get it to connect automatically, and remember my password (securely)?\nI have checked the 'Connect Automatically' box on the Configure VPN page, but this seems to have no effect. I've also got the 'Start connecting automatically' box checked in the pop-up box, and that does avoid the need to press the connect button in that window, but seems to have no part in kicking off the whole process in the first place. There is no option to remember the password in the window, but maybe there's one somewhere else?\n\nA: When setting up a VPN connection through Network Manager selecting the Connect automatically option should mean that the VPN does automatically connect, however this isn't working due to a bug: https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/network-manager/+bug/280571\nIt can still achieved though through workarounds, one way of doing this would be to use vpnautoconnect \n\n\n*\n\n*Set up your VPN as normal through the network settings, making sure\nthat Connect automatically is selected:\n\n\n\n\n\n*\n\n*Download the appropriate .deb file from the\ndownload page: http://sourceforge.net/projects/vpnautoconnect/files/\n(ending in amd64 for 64bit, ending in i386 for 32bit).\n\n*Double click the downloaded .deb file and install it.\n\n*Run the VPNautoconnect application\n\n\n\n\n\n*\n\n*Select Preferences from the VPNautoconnect menu\n\n\n\n\n\n*\n\n*Click the small arrow to create a new tab and select your wireless\nconnection in the Parent Connection drop down menu, and your VPN\nin the VPN Connection drop down menu. Then click Save\n\n\nYour VPN should now connect automatically whenever the selected wireless network is connected (if you use more than one wireless network you'll need to create a new tab in the preferences menu for each one you want to auto connect to a VPN whilst you are using).\n\nA: In Ubuntu Gnome 16.04, I can't find in Network Connections the GUI option  to edit per-network VPN settings. The solution for me was to launch the \"Network Connections\" panel manually in the terminal by typing:\nnm-connection-editor\nthen edit the desired network and add a VPN connection to it.\n\nA: On 18.04, and some previous version also, there is not even a GUI settings to automatically enable a VPN connection now.\nSo instead, I enable automatic connection to ethernet and then setup the VPN connection with an autostart config file and script.\nAdd a vpn.desktop file in ~/.config/autostart with the following content\n[Desktop Entry]\nName=Start VPN connection\nGenericName=Network helper\nComment=Start automatically VPN connection\nExec=/home/me/bin/vpn-start.sh\nTerminal=false\nType=Application\nIcon=network-vpn\nCategories=Network;\nStartupNotify=false\nX-GNOME-Autostart-enabled=true\n\nThis will call a file that you can put everywhere, but I have put in in /home/me/bin/ and call it vpn-start.sh\n#/bin/bash\nLANG=C\nwhile ! nmcli dev status|grep -q connected; do\n    sleep 1\ndone\nexec nmcli con up '<name of your vpn connection>'\n\nYou need to put the name of your VPN connection. Look for it in the output of nmcli con show.\nMake it executable with chmox +x vpn-start.sh.\nAnd logout-relogin to test for it.\n\nA: Seems like autoconnect doesn't work with VPN profiles but you can use secondaries instead. See here https://manpages.debian.org/testing/network-manager/nm-settings.5.en.html.\nWhat I did:\nList all existing connections:\nsudo \\ls -l /etc/NetworkManager/system-connections/\n\nOpen a file of the corresponding VPN connection (my-VPN in my case):\nsudo gedit /etc/NetworkManager/system-connections/my-VPN\n\nThen copy uuid.

I would like to specify that when I press the power button in my laptop, a 'shutdown -h now' command is sent, instead of bringing up the graphical shutdown menu.

The app loads but UI messed up!\n\nA: Provided you have installed \nlibavcodec-extra-52 \nfrom multiverse and your music files are not DRM protected most software media players including the default player Banshee will be able to play the audio files from your iTunes library.\nTo have acess to these files on the same machine you just have to mount the NTFS partition where your music library resides (see here and there).\nIn case these files are on a different machine there is no other way than setting up some kind of networking to gain access (e.g. by mounting the network share). This is also the way it is done by the proprietary Apple UPnP-like solution called \"Home Sharing\" that unfortunately is not Open Source and thus can not be made available to Ubuntu. However there is commercial software that allow bridging to a UPnP client (e.g. Allegro). \nSee also this question for other solutions to set up a UPnP server that do not involve iTunes. \nTo have access from Ubuntu your music player needs to be capable of being an UPnP client.

When using the Zoom function of Compiz, the zoomed-in pixels are anti-aliased (smoothed), which I guess is helpful for accessibility, however I want to actually see an accurate representation of the pixels (for graphic design purposes). Is there a way to disable the anti-alias feature?\n\nA: Which zoom plugin are you using? \n\nOnly 1 of them has options for linear filtering, so if you are using the Zoom Desktop plugin, disable Linear filter.  You'll need CCSM for this sudo apt-get install compizconfig-settings-manager and possibly sudo apt-get install compiz-plugins-extra\n\nAlso make sure Bicubic filter is not enabled\n\nNote\nFrom this confirmed bug-report:\n\n\n*\n\n*https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/compiz-plugins-extra/+bug/944407\nThis answer currently does not apply to 12.04 or later.\n\nA: In 12.04 up to at least 15.10, the only way to disable anti-aliasing in the zoom feature is to disable it altogether at the OpenGL level:\n\nOpenGL > General > Texture Filter = Fast\n\nThis has the drawback of disabling anti-aliasing for all other scaled or 3D features, such as the 3D cubes or the Scale plugin (Super+S). Whether this is relevant to you depends on which plugins you use.\nAs for me, I care more about getting an accurate representation of the individual pixels when I zoom, than to have smooth thumbnails in the Scale view, so I'm glad I could find the global OpenGL option.\nIn some future release the Enhanced Zoom plugin will hopefully contain a specific Linear Filter option in the Animation tab, as can be seen in the project wiki: http://wiki.compiz.org/Plugins/Ezoom\n", "Q: I need gui Ubuntu server \nPossible Duplicate:\nHow to get a GUI environment with Ubuntu Server? \n\nI am a desktop user (windows and I am trying to get a gui interface on a new install of 10.04 server how can I do this \n\nA: Well a graphical interface feels more comfortable, it is of limited value on a server as most of what you are going to be doing is starting / stopping services, editing configuration files, and or installing software, all of which can be done from the command line.\nIt is overwhelming , the Ubuntu Server Gide is a great place to start, gui or not.\nssh + screen allows secure, remote access (use keys, disable passwords).\nIf you still want a graphical interface, try to install as light an interface as possible, perhaps fluxbox or openbox, or perhaps Lubuntu.

I'd like to change the visual appearance of the marked resize border/areas in Nautilus:\n\nIf I knew how those elements are named in GTK+, I'm sure I could find out what I'd need to add to /usr/share/themes/Ambiance/gtk-3.0/apps/nautilus.css.\n\nA: I changed the last entry in /usr/share/themes/Ambiance/gtk-3.0/apps/nautilus.css to:\nNautilusWindow > GtkTable .pane-separator {\n    background-color: shade (@dark_bg_color, 1.1);\n    border-width: 0;\n}\n\nto get this:\n\nInstead of using just a single background color, you can also use a gradient:\nNautilusWindow > GtkTable .pane-separator {\n    background-image: -gtk-gradient (linear, left top, left bottom,\n                                 from (shade (@dark_bg_color, 1.04)),\n                                 to (shade (@dark_bg_color, 2.2)));\n    border-width: 0;\n}\n\nIf you want to remove the handle icon, you have to set the -unico-inner-stroke-color to transparent:\nNautilusWindow > GtkTable .pane-separator {\n    background-image: -gtk-gradient (linear, left top, left bottom,\n                                 from (shade (@dark_bg_color, 1.04)),\n                                 to (shade (@dark_bg_color, 2.2)));\n    border-width: 0;\n\n    -unico-inner-stroke-color: @transparent;\n}\n\nYou can also change the thickness of the resize pane by adding this to the CSS file (will make the resize pane 3 pixels thick):\nNautilusWindow * {\n    -GtkPaned-handle-size: 3;\n}\n\nThe final thing looks like this:\n\nThanks to Andrea Cimitan for helping a bit. ;-)\n", "Q: Why are the Caps Lock and Num lock indicators not working on my keyboard? Recently I've upgraded my Ubuntu.\nWhen I press the Caps-Lock its indicator on my keyboard turns on, but it doesn't turn off when I press it again!\nAnd also I've got problem with NumLock key. When I press it, it's light indicator doesn't turn on but NumLock has actually been activated!\nIs it a bug?\n\nA: The problem is because of the inappropriate driver used. Ubuntu's default drivers might not suite your keyboard. If You have a dual boot use the keyboard on windows to confirm it is because of Ubuntu only. If yes then you will have to try additional drivers that might be provided by Manufacturer or Download from Internet. There is a additional driver option for Ubuntu in the dash.

In the Linux / Unix administration handbook it mentions that you can edit the /etc/inittab file to change the run level. I don't have that file on 10.04. I Googled this and found a tip saying that file had been replaced with /etc/event.d/rc-default - however I don't have that file on my system either.\nHave these been deleted or does 10.04 deal with run levels differently?\n\nA: To See the Current Run Level Command:\n$ who -r or $ runlevel\nIf you want chance the runlevel Command \n$ sudo init 1 ( it will take to u single user mode)\nThis are differnt runlevel you can perform :\n0 - System halt; no activity, the system can be safely powered down.\n1 - Single user; rarely used.\n2 - Multiple users, no NFS (network filesystem); also used rarely.\n3 - Multiple users, command line (i.e., all-text mode) interface; the standard runlevel for most Linux-based server hardware.\n4 - User-definable\n5 - Multiple users, GUI (graphical user interface); the standard runlevel for most \nLinux-based desktop systems.\n6 - Reboot; used when restarting the system. \n\nA: Yes, it deals with them differently.\nTo see the current (and previous) runlevel:\nrunlevel\n\nTo switch runlevels:\nsudo init $runlevel\n\nFor example, to reboot:\nsudo init 6\n\nThe init you are reading about was replaced by upstart starting with Edgy Eft 6.10; and, one of the programs provided by upstart is its own implementation of init.\nHere are the docs for 10.04.\nTo change the default runlevel, use your favorite text editor on /etc/init/rc-sysinit.conf...\nsudo vim /etc/init/rc-sysinit.conf\n\nChange this line to whichever runlevel you want...\nenv DEFAULT_RUNLEVEL=2\n\nThen, at each boot, upstart will use that runlevel.\n\nA: Normally this is done by explicitly adding a number to the kernel options in the GRUB entry.\nLet's say, you want to change default grub entry from default run level (5) to 3:\nsudo vim /boot/grub/grub.cfg\n\nFind a place of default boot entry, and have a look at linux line. Might look something like this:\nlinux   /boot/vmlinuz-3.0.0-13-generic root=UUID=d07e0c99-65ba-4eda-98d8-79693dc79554 ro   quiet splash vt.handoff=7\n\nAdd 3 at the end of that line:\nlinux   /boot/vmlinuz-3.0.0-13-generic root=UUID=d07e0c99-65ba-4eda-98d8-79693dc79554 ro   quiet splash vt.handoff=7 3\n\nTry it out:\nsudo reboot\n\n\nA: You could also make use of the corresponding target of your desired runlevel. You can check which of the available target your system is running as default using: \nsystemctl get-default  \n\nSupposing the graphical.target is the default, you can further check its definition and detailed information using:systemctl cat graphical.target. There are some target units tailored after the corresponding runlevels. You can find which of them are available on your system by listing them: systemctl list-unit-files -t target\n Suppose you want to set runlevel 2 as default, you can do this by running:\nsudo systemctl set-default runlevel2.target\n\nYou should use this with caution and make sure you are not causing any issues running on the inappropriate target.\n", "Q: How can I install Nvidia driver 96.43.20?  \nPossible Duplicate:\nHow do I install the NVIDIA driver for a GeForce 6200? \n\nTo install the nvidia driver 96.43.20, you must exit the xserver.I used \"sudo lightdm stop\" to do this.  the screen then went blank and seemed to be showing a text editor which I don't know the commands for.

The reason I ask is because a whole load of Gnome related packages were also installed alongside Firestarter. As I understand it, Gnome is not part of Lubuntu. Should I be avoinding anything which requires Gnome-based packages now that I am on Lubuntu? Is there a better firewall to use with Lubuntu\nFinally, after a clean install of Lubuntu, I had to go online to get Firestarter. Does this mean that my system was without protection during this period? Could someone have haxored me during this time?\n\nA: Most users won't need to use a firewall at all, since Ubuntu doesn't have any open ports by default. But Firestarter is a only a GUI to configure the firewall. It will still run when you're not running Firestarter. It'll just use the same configuration until you change it. \nI see nothing bad about installing Gnome packages in Lubuntu, and vice versa. For instance, I've used the panel from LXDE in Gnome.

I'm using Ubuntu 11.10.\nAll of the guides that I found only have programs for Windows. What should I do?\n\nA: Not sure which direction you are trying to achieve, but there are a couple things to consider.\n\n\n*\n\n*if you are installing WinXp inside VirtualBox or VMWare Player for ubuntu, it is really no brainer.. just pop in the ISO image, and VMWare should take care of installation for you.\n\n*if you are doing dual booting, you need to determine if your BIOS can boot USB. If so, I would go ahead and build a Windows PE or Bart's Boot disk. Once you boot into the PE environment, you can use diskpart to format the partition (i.e. in NTFS, not FAT32). After that you browse to the WinXp installation folder and kick off the installation with command like \"Winnt32.exe /syspart:d: /tempdrive:d /makelocalsource\"   Once installation done, you then need to fix the MBR, so that GRUB can co-exist with Windows.

Everything in 11.04 worked fine.\nDoes anybody know why? \nIs there a solution to this?\n\nA: Unless you find out which program is spiking the CPU you can't solve the problem. Use a system monitor such as System Monitor or htop to see which program is responsible for consuming your CPU. It might be Nautilus, or it might be something else.\nIn my case, Compiz eats a lot of CPU. The only solution I've found is to run an environment that doesn't use Compiz, such as Unity 2D or Gnome Shell.\n\nA: Used htop to get a much better view of what's going on than top was able to provide.  Quickly figured out that the streaming audio that I had going was causing it.  Closed that browser tab (switched over to using the same stream on my smartphone), and voila!  I can use my laptop again at an acceptable rate.\n", "Q: How do I start a wine program from the command line? \nPossible Duplicate:\nInvoke a wine installed application from command line \n\nI would like to start a wine program via the terminal so if something goes wrong I can see what. \nWhat command should I type in to get the program started?\nfor an example lets say Spotify. \n\nA: You just have to\nwine /path/to/your/exe/program.exe\n\n", "Q: How to fix \"Disk drive for /boot/efi is not ready or not present\"? After I updated BIOS/UEFI version to 1101 on an Asus P8Z68-V PRO motherboard Ubuntu (11.10) did not boot.

I accidentally booted into the Windows recovery partition which gave me an option to quit or continue to wipe the disk. I selected the option to quit but an onscreen message said initialising (which I thought was odd, since I expected it to just reboot when I selected quit). After a few minutes I cut the power to prevent it from overriding my hdd. \nWhen I rebooted I got the grub rescue prompt but after using ls it turns out that every partition has msdos in the name, I..e hd0,msdos1. Then I tried my liveUSB but kept getting a kernel panic message saying out of memory (I have 2G of RAM so shouldn't be a problem). Finally I decided to remove the hdd. Now I can boot with my liveUSB but whenever I connect the hdd (using a SATA enclosure) it takes the entire OS down.\nAny idea how I can inspect the hdd without it freezing the OS? I'm out of ideas!\n\n\n*\n\n*With the hard drive removed and booting with a liveUSB from an SD card I can load ubuntu but as soon as I connect the hard drive (externally via USB using the enclosure) it causes ubuntu to crash. it also causes the same effect on another machine that's running fedora\n\n*The CPU and/memory usage sky-rockets until the pc OS becomes unresponsive (even when the drive is removed). The logs are a good idea, I didnt check because I'm using the liveUSB with no persistent storage (so the logs disappear when I hit the power button to reset the machine). However you gave me an idea and I've checked the messages log on the fedora machine. The last entry says \"attached SCSI disk\" which doesn't give much away but just before that it lists sdb1, sdb2 all the way through to sdb255... I've not seen that before.\n\n*So far its crashed both Linux computers that I've connected to. Windows does not cause a crash and detects that the drive is connected but fails to mount it. A pc repair shop will be too expensive. There must be a way to stop Linux from entering the continuous loop (which is what I assume is using all of the memory) when the hdd is plugged in?\n\nA: Sorted! When the hard drive was connected to linux it would take down the system by causing a kernel panic. However it took a few seconds before the system stopped responding so I used a partitioning program on fedora to erase the mbr in those few seconds. Once the mbr was deleted I could connect it externally without it causing a system failure and then use other tool to recover data and reformat the hdd.\n", "Q: System lockup in 11.10 afer installing nvidia-current, horrible/sluggish performance when using nvidia 173 drivers I've been trying to get this resolved for the last two days now; I've done a complete/clean reinstall of 11.10; I've tried reinstalling and uninstalling the nvidia drivers multiple ways (ie, using jockey, downloading from nvidia website, etc) but nothing has worked.\nI get horrible performance from the 173 drivers (slow gnome-shell operation/animations, slow web browsing, file browsing, etc).\nWhen I \"Activate\" the nvidia-current drivers in jockey then reboot, I get great performance and everything runs smoothly, but the system goes into complete lockup after about a minute of use. everything on the display freezes/stops responding including the mouse and keyboard.\nI have a bit of terminal knowledge, so feel free to throw some code, etc, at me or tell me to retrieve/post log file outputs....\nMy system is a Gateway P-6860FX with a 1.8GHz Dore2Duo, 4 gigs of DDR2 RAM and a nvidia 8800M GTS (512mb version).

You can add it to ~/.bashrc like so:\nCLASSPATH=/path/to/1:/path/to/2:/etc\n\nThe change will take effect globally the next time you log in. However, it will take effect immediately in new shells.\nAdditionally, if you want to set it for just one particular command, do this:\nCLASSPATH=/something command-here arg1 arg2\n\nA third way would be to create a wrapper script, which would be appropriate if you needed to set multiple variables or if you needed to determine appropriate values programmatically:\n#!/bin/bash\nexport CLASSPATH=/something\nexport ANOTHER_ENV_Variable=foo\n\nexec your_fancy_program \"$@\"\n\n\nA: that's what happened with me.. i left empty spaces while typing.. it fixed when i removed spaces.\n1) if you want to set classpath permanently then 1) find out where java is installed..   you may use \"  whereis java  \" openjdk-7/6 is in /usr/lib/jvm/.....\n2) we need to set up CLASSPATH in /etc/environment\n  sudo gedit /etc/environment\n\n3) add the following likes ..

I have setup-ed key based SSH authentication to all the systems. How ever i have missed out few systems. If i taken the address of the added hosts, i can find out the non added hosts address. Is there any command to retreive the added hosts address? Thanks in advance.\nUpdate\n\n*\n\n*Output of awk '{print $1}' ~/.ssh/known_hosts can be found here.\n\n\nA: What you have is a hashed known_hosts file, which is the default. These are one-way hashes of the host|key, so you cannot recover the actual hostname. This is intentional, as knowledge of all the hosts you have accessed and cached keys for (and, perhaps more importantly, knowing which ones you haven't) is fairly valuable to someone who wants to fool you into sharing your passwords with them. Its not enough if you're using SSH keys, as you may do something sensitive while logged in through an attacker's machine.\nWhat you should do is ssh to all your machines, and verify the fingerprint carefully when doing so. Once you have all of them, you can distribute this known_hosts file to the clients that need it. Note that you can put it in /etc/ssh/known_hosts so that all users get it, not just your current user.\n\nA: Not sure if this is what you want or not\nawk '{print $1}' ~/.ssh/known_hosts\n\nThat will list the hosts you have connected to via ssh.\n", "Q: What Filesystem to use when working between Ubuntu & Mac?

Burn the parts to several 4.7 Gb discs. You can use cat to restore the parts to 1 file.\nAnother method would be to unpack the ISO and burn the files to several disc.\n\nA: You're not going to be able to back up that game on a single layer disc. You simply need the storage. It's not like a DVD where you can just re-encode it to a lower quality, that game is a collection of thousands of files that need to be intact. You will need a Dual-layer disc.\nIf you'd like you can rip the DVD to an .iso on your desktop. Brasero could probably create one for you.\n\nA: DVD95\nIt is available in the Ubuntu Software Center.

Below is a way to use a virtual machine to do the actual installation, but it's performed on your hard drive.\n\n\n*\n\n*Prepare a new partition onto where you want to install Windows.\n\n*Start the Windows installation with a Qemu virtual machine and your physical hard drive mapped (target partition can't be mounted):\nqemu -hda /dev/sda -cdrom winxp.iso -m 1G -boot d --enable-kvm\n\n\n*Install Windows on the partition you created.\n\n*Reinstall Grub (if partition isn't first, you need to do a trick with mapping hd's, its working for me).\n\n\nA: You will need: \n\n\n*\n\n*CD or USB stick containing GParted (see below) \n\n*Windows DVD or USB stick (of course) \n\n*Ubuntu Live CD or Live USB, version 10.04 or later \n\n\nFirst use GParted to free some space to host Windows:\nInstall Windows as usual selecting the space you just created using GParted. This will \"activate\" only Windows and Ubuntu will not be accessible at this point.\nTo make Ubuntu accessible again, take the Ubuntu Live CD and follow this guide (or see this question or this or that help wiki page.).\n\nA: This is hardly a complete answer, but it may help. I have a development machine here with Windows 7 and Kubuntu; I used a 128 GB SSD for Windows (the whole thing) and have Kubuntu dominant on my other three hard drives, with a limited partition made for media files in Windows. Any time I do have to reinstall Windows, I simply pull out the SATA cables from the back of my other hard drives first. After the install, I power down, plug them back in, power up, and set up Windows to use the proper directories (on the other hard drives) for user documents. I've done this more than once and it's yet to give me any trouble. GRUB even recognized it after a quick device scan.\nI understand that you're trying to do this on a single hard drive, but everyone else has already highlighted the issues behind this (mostly with Windows being a complete #$%@&* about having to share). If you can get a cheap SSD or even HDD, and plug it in in parallel, then keep your more-responsible OSes on the major drives, it should make the process simple. You won't even have to worry about partitioning.\n(I will also say that if you do do it this way, you'll save yourself a lot of trouble by keeping every drive either MBR or GPT; try not to mix and match. It makes booting more complicated than anyone wants to deal with.)\nBest of luck!\n\nA: You cant install easy like wubi in windows. Yo have to create virtual machine of windows. If you have iso file for windows os, you follow the bellow,\nDownload VirtualBox, and you will get the deb file, use Ubuntu software center to install. After install it,  \n\n\n*\n\n*Select \"NEW\"\n\n\n*Name OS,\n\n\n*Select RAM size,\n\n\n*select Hardrive type,\n\n\n*Select VDI,\n\n\n*Select Dynamically allocated(for using available free space) else select fixed size(it's not recommended by me),\n\n\n*Select Hard Disk size\n\n\n*Your virtual machine is ready,\n\n\n*To start it, Go to settings --> Storage, Here select iso file you have stored in system \n\n\n*Click ok, and select start. \n\n\nA: The easiest way I found to install windows on a ubuntu or any linux only pc is as follows -\n\n\n*\n\n*Download and Extract the entire Windows ISO to any of your drive partition. Just make sure it's preferably an NTFS partition and is not the target partition in which you want to install windows and also don't put all the files inside a folder, just extract in like, say (hd0,5)/. \n\n*Now open /boot/grub/grub.cfg in any text editor (with root access) and paste it -\n\nmenuentry 'Windows 10' {\nset root=(hd0,5)\ninsmod ntldr\nntldr /bootmgr\n}\n\n\nNow change (hd0,5) to the partition where you have extracted the ISO image.\nReboot your computer and choose windows 10 from boot menu. \nWindows is Like Blind about ext3 or ext4 partition so you don't have to worry about deleting it accidentally. Once you have installed Windows, you can always install grub to revive your lost ubuntu partition.\nI have made a video to show How to install Windows 10 from ISO image in linux GRUB \n\nA: I think know what your trying to say I think you mean install Windows over Ubuntu. Just put your windows Operating System Disk in you PC and just install it over Ubuntu. But I don't know if you have important files on your Ubuntu OS so save all your usb,sd, or a disk. \n\nA: Impossible As far as I know. First If you use Linux native partitioning, windows will not access it and hence NOT install anything. Also, even if it installs, there is issue of mbr, which will take you into complexities of overwriting each other. So it is practically bad decision and to my knowledge impossible!\nWhat is so hard/wrong with putting them in separate partition?\n", "Q: \"disk drive for /dev/shm is not ready yet\" at boot I am running Ubuntu 11.10 i386 on a laptop. I recently upgraded linux generic kernel to 3.0.0-14 with a PPA (eugensan/boiler): I actually was looking to install just one piece of software (\"unison\"), but I got carried away and installed all the updates the PPA was providing, including the kernel  (silly of me, I know... ,I'll sure think twice next time)\nAfter the upgrade, at boot time the system complains with:\n\ndisk drive for /run/shm is not ready yet or not present\"\n\n\nand a similar message for /run/tmp\nI can still boot by opting to skip these filesystems.  However Chrome will not work now unless I enter the following commands:\nsudo mkdir /run/shm\nchmod 1777 /dev/shm\n\nI reverted back to the previous kernel (3.0.0-13), removed the PPA and searched the web quite extensively, but to no avail.\nI also checked /etc/fstab and this is what I have:\nproc         /proc    proc    nodev,noexec,nosuid 0       0\n/dev/sda1    /        ext4    errors=remount-ro   0       1\nUUID=c79075aa-eb63-43bc-ab8f-12eb26bfcfbd none  swap    sw     0       0\n\nIf anybody has any suggestion on how to fix this, it would be greatly appreciated!\n\nA: Mountall package in eugenesan ppa is broken.

There isn't an AllowOverride statement in the apache2.conf file, but the default is All, and it doesn't change anything if I include one.\nI've tried including the contents of the local .htaccess file in a  section.  I've also tried this:\n<Directory /var/www/mydomain.com/html>\nAllowOverride All\n</Directory>\n\nI also tried changing all instances of AllowOverride in /etc/apache2/sites-available/default (which are all set to Noneby default) to All.\nBut I've had no luck.\nNot sure how to solve this one.\n\nA: I worked out what it was since I opened this thread: there were two issues that I would have thought would crop up in any vanilla LAMP setup installed according to the Media Temple Knowledgebase article (which was what I used to set up the (ve) server).\nFirstly,  it was the rewrite module. It appeared as though my .htaccess files weren’t being read by the server because a rewrite module has to be enabled: this seems to be the default on a fresh install such as the one I just carried out. Who knew?\nEnabling the module is pretty simple: I just needed to make a symbolic link to the rewrite.load file from the mods-available directory to the mods-enabled directory (all found, in this instance, in the apache2 directory, at /etc/apache2).\nRan the following:\ncd /etc/apache2/mods-enabled\nln -s /etc/apache2/mods-available/rewrite.load rewrite.load\n\nSecondly, I concluded I also need to change all instances of AllowOverride in /etc/apache2/sites-available/default (which are all set to None by default) to All(see this article which explains the issue).\nFinally was the question of how to apply the rules.  I actually chose to delete my .htaccess file and place all its rules in a <Directory> section in http.conf (which is now a separate file still called in apache2.conf, and which I'll use to include all my customizations), because setting AllowOverride to None and relying on apache2.conf for everything induces an increase in speed as the server no longer has to check for an .htaccess file at every level before loading a page.  I then deleted the .htaccess, set AllowOverrideto None, and the rules still loaded fine.\n\nA: This sounds like mod_rewrite isn't enabled. Try running the following:\na2enmod rewrite\n\nIf the command reports back that rewrite has been enabled, restart Apache with sudo service apache2 restart if it says that it's already enabled, then this isn't the answer :)\n\nA: Ensure the following:\n/etc/apache2/apache2.conf\n#\n# AccessFileName: The name of the file to look for in each directory\n# for additional configuration directives.  See also the AllowOverride\n# directive.\n#\n\nAccessFileName .htaccess\n\n#\n# The following lines prevent .htaccess and .htpasswd files from being \n# viewed by Web clients. \n#\n<Files ~ \"^\\.ht\">\n    Order allow,deny\n    Deny from all\n    Satisfy all\n</Files>\n\nUbuntu - HTTPD - Apache2 Web Server might be of help.\n--edit--\n\n\n*\n\n*Changes to .conf files do not take effect immediately, a restart will always be required. A reload might also work, but I'm not sure in which situations a reload just isn't enough.\n/etc/init.d/apache2 restart\n", "Q: KDE4 memory use optimization Are there any good tips for optimizing KDE4 memory consumption?\nIt feels like a memory hog, even when I have 4GB of RAM and i5 CPU it feels heavy.\nI disabled all effects but still it feels heavy and consumes twice more memory then Gnome.\nAny points for optimization of KDE4 (not Ubuntu in general)?\n\nA: Try this package:\nsudo apt-get install kubuntu-low-fat-settings\n\nIt is specifically designed to minimize ram consumption and speed up the system as much as possible.\n\nA: I do not think it is a memory issue in machine with 4 gb RAM.

When I upgraded from 11.04 to 11.10 my system stopped working, and so I reinstalled 11.04.

If my Windows workgroup is made of two words with a space in-between, does Samba's config file need quotes around the workgroup name, example: WORKGROUP = \"MY WORKGROUP\"\n\nA: Apparently not. See man smb.conf - one of the first sections, FILE FORMAT, tells you:\n   The values following the equals sign in parameters are all either a\n   string (no quotes needed) or a boolean, which may be given as yes/no,\n   1/0 or true/false.\n\nSo there you go - no you don't have to quote in smb.conf.\n\nA: Spaces aren't allowed in NetBIOS names (such as a workgroup) so you're likely to run into problems later if you try to do this.\n", "Q: After updating kernel to 3.0.0-14 the system does not boot After the updatemanager gave me an update of the kernel from 3.0.0-13 to -14 i am not able to boot with that new kernel. I have to manually select -13 from older kernels.\nThis is even true for failsafe mode...\nIt shows the animated bootlogo and after 1 or 2 minutes the animation freezes, after that point the HDD-Light flashes randomly. I took a nap for an hour or so for one of the tryies, not even in this hughe timespan something happened.\nWith CTRL-ALT-DELETE I can still shut down the system, also it responds to the Power-Switch and shuts off, in both cases without any animation. I just see that the HDD-activity raises and after a further minute or two the System powers down.\nRobinJ made a suggestion it could have something to do with my nVidia-drivers, so I followed his instructions (remove the nVidia-driver, reboot into old kernel, reboot into new kernel, reinstall driver). But removing the drivers did not help. The boot does still stuck, so I cant reinstall the driver in the new kernel.\nBut during the reboot process I managed to hit ESCAPE at the right point of time. The last message displayed before the boot stops is Checking battery state. So I tried to boot without AC-Adapter or battery, both does not help either, so I am back at kernel version -13 (still without the drivers)\nIs there a way to get -14 working or at least have -13 standardkernel for booting until the problem is solved?\n\nA: Go into the old kernel version (the one that still boots), and remove the NVidia drivers, preferably with Jockey (the Additional hardware drivers dialog).\nThen reboot into the old kernel again (for safety's sake, I think it does something at the next boot when you remove the NVidia drivers).\nThen, boot into the new kernel. If you had the same problem as I had when I updated the kernel then it should boot. You should now also be able to safely install the NVidia drivers again, just make sure you install them when running the newer kernel.\n\nA: RobinJ's answer has worked for me.  I booted to -13 and uninstalled nvidia drivers using Jockey. When booting -14, the boot halted on the same \"Checking Battery Status\" message.\nI Ctrl+F1'd to a terminal and discovered that my /etc/X11/xorg.conf file still referenced the nvidia driver.  To fix, I:\nsudo mv /etc/X11/xorg.conf /etc/X11/xorg.conf.bak\nsudo reboot\n\nUpon rebooting, Ubuntu ran correctly.

The problem is that the usbmount mounts it using default permissions with root as owner.\nAny idea how I can configure the usbmount to do this?\n\nA: You set ownership and permissions in /etc/usbmount/usbmount.conf\nThe file is well commented, you are looking for the section\n# For example, \"-fstype=vfat,gid=floppy,dmask=0007,fmask=0117\" would add\n# the options \"gid=floppy,dmask=0007,fmask=0117\" when a vfat filesystem\n# is mounted.\nFS_MOUNTOPTIONS=\"\"\n\nEnter in your options in the \"FS_MOUNTOPTIONS=\" line. \nExample, to allow user and group, but deny otheres:\nuid=your_uid,gid=your_gid,dmask=0077,fmask=0177\n\nSee man mount for options or identify the file system (NTFS / FAT) if you need assistance.\n\nA: Your USB flash drive is probably formatted using FAT, which can not store Linux permissions or owner information. Because of this, the Linux kernel pretends root owns all files.\nIf you want to allow custom permissions, you might want to either reformat the flash drive using a file system other than FAT (ext3?).

I want to run a command similar to this where AVI files older than 7 days will be deleted:\nfind \"/home/user/videos folder/*.avi\" -mtime +7 -exec rm -f\nBut as you can see, the videos folder has a space so I had to put that path in quotes. But, will the asterisk still do its job to find all AVI files, or will Linux now think the asterisk is the actual filename now?\nLet's just assume I didn't want to remove the space in the path by renaming the folder.\n\nA: You need to reformat your command a bit for it to work.\nTry this:\nfind \"/home/user/videos folder\" -name \"*.avi\" -mtime +7 -exec rm -f {} \\;\n\nOr, in GNU find, to achieve the same thing without -exec:\nfind \"/home/user/videos folder\" -name \"*.avi\" -mtime +7 -delete\n\nThe first argument to find is the folder to look in - you shouldn't try and put your entire filter in here, just the starting point. Then use -name to tell it what pattern to look for. You can try this without the -exec or -delete first until you are satisified, then you won't do any damage by trying it.\nEnclosing an argument in quotes basically stops the shell from messing with it. If you use -name *.avi, then the argument that find will see could be anything, because the shell will parse it (and replace it with the contents of the current directory that end in .avi) before calling find. This is usually bad and will lead to unexpected results. find knows how to parse * itself.\n", "Q: 'waiting for network connection' error on boot When I start my system, all the process is perfectly normal, until this message appears: 'waiting for network configuration' after that one there comes 'waiting up to 60 more seconds for network configuration' and finally, like after 3 minutes of waiting, there comes 'booting system without full network configuration'.\nNormally, at home I'm connected through a normal wired internet connection, but when I need to take my laptop to any other place without a wired internet connection like work or the university, the above mentioned messages appear and well...

Then, you can see the help menu.\nBy the way, the keyboard shortcut for accessing the menubar is F10.\n\nA: You can see the menus in Ubuntu simply by pressing and holding the Alt key, they will be integrated in the global menu bar on top.\nIt will also show if you hover over it.\n\nA: At the bottom of the menu there is a small question mark, which when clicked opens a help menu sidebar!\nRunning: \nXubuntu 14.04  and Firefox 32.0\n\n\nA: Also, you can obtain firefox version through command line\nfirefox --version\n\nor equivalently\nfirefox -v\n\n\nA: In addition to the above answers you could as well use a more general approach and ask your operating system itself what it has installed\napt-cache policy firefox\n\nThis outputs the full name of the ubuntu package.\nExample: 46.0+build5-0ubuntu0.14.04.2\n", "Q: How can I make a script to place files older than each day before into their own folder?

However due to hibernate and wakeup problems and indication's that this could be due to the Nvidia driver, I, in my infinite wisdom, removed the driver and am now dead in the water - won't boot.  I can get to the Grub splash screen (I also have a MS Windows  7 partition).\nHow do I reinstall the driver if I can't boot?  I can come up with my 11.04 live CD.  I am not expert at this and am 70 years old so complete explanations would be helpful.\n\nA: I'm guessing your problem is not booting, but your display driver not showing correctly your screen. If you're sure that this is not the case, disregard my answer.\nIf you reset your graphic configuration ubuntu should be able to reconfigure all display settings using the default driver.\nAfter grub, press ctrl+alt+f4 to open a terminal. Login and then type sudo rm -rf /etc/X11/xorg.conf (please note the uppercase X); you will be asked to put your password again. Once the command is done, reboot.\nHope it helps.\n\nA: I hope you already fixed this, but if not, I believe you can rerun the portion of the install that configures the drivers with the command\nsudo dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg\n\nwhich will walk you through the setup steps again.\nTo get to a command line where you can type this either select the recovery mode boot from the grub menu, or, if you are already booted but only see a black screen, you can likely switch to another terminal session by the key combination:\nCtrl+Alt+F1\nNote: Normally the standard graphics display is reached by:\nCtrl+Alt+F7\nand others CLI are found on Ctrl+Alt+F2 through Ctrl+Alt+F6\nMore info on \nhttp://www.freesoftwaremagazine.com/article/how_to_fix_your_computers_graphics_with_dpkg-reconfigure\n", "Q: Restart when I go to /home or run certain programs \nPossible Duplicate:\nNVIDIA drivers not working after upgrade.

This is a change in behavior from previous versions.  Is there a way to revert this behavior and get the Update Manager in Oneiric to ask for a password again?\nThanks!\n\nA: This is a deliberate change in behaviour (source):\n\nAs of Ubuntu 11.10, update-manager no longer prompts for the user's password to apply  updates. This was decided to improve usability and to make it easier for users to apply security updates and therefore increase system security. The rationale is as follows:\n\n*\n\n*Like in previous releases, by default only people in the admin group are allowed access to perform security updates.\n\n\n*Only updates for already installed software can be applied without a password. Installing additional software still requires people to enter their password.\n\n\n*The password prompt had become an irritant for some people such that they would just press 'Cancel' instead of installing the updates. The password prompt decreased system security for those users.\n\n\n*People that did dutifully apply updates became conditioned to enter their privileged password perhaps daily. When the user is prompted for the password, it should mean something and the frequency of update-manager updates meant that some people no longer thought about why they were entering their password. For these users, the password prompt had the potential to reduce security.\nFor environments where this change is deemed not appropriate, this functionality can be disabled by the administrator via PolicyKit or by creating users that are not in the admin group (a recommended practice to begin with).\n\nThe relevant PolicyKit policy is in the file /var/lib/polkit-1/localauthority/10-vendor.d/com.ubuntu.desktop.pkla:\n[Update already installed software]\nIdentity=unix-group:admin\nAction=org.debian.apt.upgrade-packages\nResultActive=yes\n\nThis grants permission for anybody in the admin group to update packages without having to enter a password. I've never used PolicyKit before now, but based on my reading of the manpage for pklocalauthority, to override this you should create a this file..\n/var/lib/polkit-1/localauthority/50-local.d/require-password-to-update.pkla\nyou'll need superuser priviledges to create it, so use this command...\ngksudo gedit /var/lib/polkit-1/localauthority/50-local.d/require-password-to-update.pkla\nwhich will open a new file in gedit and put the following policy entry in it:\n[Require password to upgrade already installed software]\nIdentity=unix-group:admin\nAction=org.debian.apt.upgrade-packages\nResultActive=auth_admin\n\nSave this and exit gedit, you can now open update manager and it will ask you to confirm your password before applying any updates.\n", "Q: Marlin and integration of various VCS? I just stumbled in another question (http://askubuntu.com/questions/86749/how-to-change-the-file-manager-from-nautilus-to-marlin) upon the filemanager \"Marlin\".\nI tried it a bit, and it seems to suit me more than Nautilus. except one tiny thing...\nI had Nautilus-integrators for SVN, GIT, Bazaar, Mercurial, CVS. Not as a replacement for the commandline tools, but I wanted to see the status of a file in the filebrowser.\nAre there Plugins for Marlin that have at least these status icons? Context menu for the various VCS is not needed but would be nice for quickaccess.\n\nA: Not at the moment (as far as I know).\nThe PPA contains only 2 integration plugins: UbuntuOne and Dropbox. Those are created and maintained at the moment by the developers of Marlin.\nMarlin is still under (heavy) development and one would expect some plugins to show up in the future but not at the same level as Nautilus. The plugins from Nautilus will not (as you might know) work with Marlin.\nMarlin is a very recent project if you compare it with Nautilus, I am guessing it is just a mater of time and future support.

This works for passing multiple files to the program. The %f is changed to %F (upper case) to pass all the files dropped, replacing the ^ (for the beginning of the line) with enough of the path name to make it more likely unique, the 'g' at the end of the sed command to cause the replacement to repeat for all files passed and finally the $ instead of the / so that the \\ escape characters are not necessary.\nExec=sh -c \"echo %F | sed 's$/home$z:/home$g' | xargs wine /home/owner/.wine/dosdevices/c:/Progs/Boxer/b.exe\"\n\nI also moved the program to be executed to a path where the pathname has no spaces, so I moved my boxer editor from:\n/home/owner/.wine/dosdevices/c:/Program Files/Boxer Text Editor/\n\nto:\n/home/owner/.wine/dosdevices/c:/Progs/Boxer/\n\n\nA: I just wrote a tiny Python script which converts Unix-style paths into Wine path format.\nDownload the zip, extract wine-launcher.py into your home folder and edit your .desktop file like this:\nExec=python ~/wine-launcher.py \"program.exe\" %F\n\n\nA: There were lots of hackish solutions posted in this thread. Here's a much better solution that deals with multiple files and with spaces in filenames.\nCreate the .desktop file as you usually do, and simply use this Exec line:\nExec=/usr/bin/env bash -c \"printf 'z:%%q\\\\n' %F | WINEPREFIX='/home/<your username>/.wine' xargs wine 'C:\\\\Path\\\\to the executable\\\\app.exe'\"\n\nEdit: If your application can handle multiple files in a single instance (for example a multi-tabbed PDF viewer) and you want the current instance to be auto-focused whenever you launch a new file then you need to do the following:\n\n\n*\n\n*Add this line to the .desktop file: StartupWMClass=app.exe\n\n*Use this Exec command:\nExec=/usr/bin/env bash -c \"(printf 'z:%%q\\\\n' %F | WINEPREFIX='/home/<your username>/.wine' xargs wine 'C:\\\\Path\\\\to the executable\\\\app.exe' &); xdotool windowactivate \\$(xdotool search --sync --onlyvisible --class \\\"app.exe\\\")\"\n\n\nA: This is the way that just worked for me on a RHEL 6.3 box after some trial and error and reading the Desktop Entry Specification.

For Apache to use test.sh, the script first needs to have executable permissions:\nchmod 755 $HOME/test.sh\n\nIt also needs to be moved to the Apache-designated CGI folder.

Hope this helps.\ncp Command\n\ncp is a Linux command for copying files and directories. The syntax is as follows:\ncp source destination\ncp dir1 dir2\ncp -option  source destination\ncp -option1 -option2  source destination\n\nIn this example copy /home/vivek/letters folder and all its files to /usb/backup directory:\ncp -avr /home/vivek/letters /usb/backup\n\nWhere,\n-a : Preserve the specified attributes such as directory an file mode, ownership, timestamps, if possible additional attributes: context, links, xattr, all.\n-v : Explain what is being done.\n-r : Copy directories recursively.\nExample\nCopy a folder called /tmp/conf to /tmp/backup:\n$ cp -avr /tmp/conf/ /tmp/backup\n\n\nA: An alternate is rsync:\nrsync -a source/ destination\n\nThe advantages of rsync are:\n\n*\n\n*After the initial sync, it will then copy only the files that have changed.\n\n*You can use it over a network, convenient for files in $HOME, especially config files.\n\n\nA: You can copy the content of a folder /source to another existing folder /dest with the command\ncp -a /source/. /dest/\n\nThe -a option is an improved recursive option, that preserve all file attributes, and also preserve symlinks.\nThe . at end of the source path is a specific cp syntax that allow to copy all files and folders, included hidden ones.\n\nA: Lets say you have a folder called folder1 in your ~, inside folder1 is 1 file called file1 and 2 folders called sub1 and sub2 each with other files and folders inside them.\nTo copy all the contents of ~/folder1 to ~/new_folder1 you would use\ncp -r ~/folder1/. ~/new_folder1\n\nnew_folder1 would then contain all the files and folders from folder1.\ncp is the command to copy using a terminal, -r makes it recursively (so, current directory + further directories inside current) ~/folder1 is the origin folder, ~/new_folder1 is the destination folder for the files/folders inside the origin.\n", "Q: How to make Minecraft run smoothly? I have noticed that on Windows, Minecraft runs a lot smoother than on Ubuntu 11.10.  What can I do to make it run smoother on here?\nI have a ATI Mobility Radeon HD 4250 Graphics card. I don't know which driver I am using, but I'm not using the Proprietary Drivers that it asks you to download and install. And I believe I'm using the newest Java. I always keep my system updated. \n\nA: Open source drivers are great because they are open, allow very good support of most hardware on them and have a better history when we are talking about desktop environment glitches, but they are not known for their speed when playing games.\nIf you really want to compare probably Windows will still get the upper coin in the end but you can have a better idea of how good the game will run in Linux using the closed proprietary drivers from ATI.\nHave a look at this post for more information on how to install, switch, go back, forwards with your graphics card driver.\nIf you find your self in trouble (I believe not, just follow the not so simple but well written instructions ;)) you can always drop another question and some one will help you restore your system. I recommend the version you get by downloading from ATI\n\nA: You're going to need to download two different things. One is the MCPatcher (Found Here). It allows you to install mods. The other is the Optifine under the heading \"OptiFine 1.0.0_HD_S_B2\" or \"OptiFine 1.0.0_HD_MT_B2\" depending on what you want(Found Here). \nClean Installation\nStart the launcher, click \"Options\" and click \"Force Update\". Then log in. After the game menu loads, close it.\nInstalling The Patch\n1: Open the MCPatcher (be sure to allow execution) and click Mods\" in the toolbar. There should be an option to add a mod. Choose that and point it to the directory that you downloaded Optifine to.\n2: Uncheck everything except \"Optifine\" and \"HD Font\". Click patch.\nOnce it is finished patching, launch the game. It should load fairly quickly. If it doesn't, you're going to want to retake the steps that I told you (from \"Clean Installation\") If it loads the game menu, click \"Options\" and then \"Video Settings\". You should see a whole load of new settings. Click around, and see what you like. It shouldn't take you long to figure it out. If you hover your mouse over any option, it will give you a description of what it does (I recommend doing this for every option). Hope this helps!\n", "Q: How can I stop Ubuntu making my TTYs a nice resolution? I have a Nvidia card. Binary drivers. No KMS support. For these reasons, I've been used to a fairly awful resolution in my TTYs. I did once try increasing the resolution of the TTYs using a grub hack but that had a huge effect on the performance of the X screen - so I nuked it.\n11.10 seems to be applying a high resolution to terminals for me. I feel it might be slowing down my X screen (both 2D and gaming performance is pretty poor) so I want to revert things to when I could only fit three characters on the screen at once </exaggeration>.\nI had a look in /etc/default/grub.d/00_header and started to cry. I've no idea what I'm looking for. When I did this before it was using a much simpler format.\n\nA: Edit /etc/default/grub with your favorite text editor, ie\nsudo nano /etc/default/grub\n\nLook for these lines\n# The resolution used on graphical terminal\n# note that you can use only modes which your graphic card supports via VBE\n# you can see them in real GRUB with the command `vbeinfo'\n#GRUB_GFXMODE=640x480\n\nUn-comment the last line and set the resolution you would like your TTYs to be.\nAfter run editing the line with the desired resolution run\nsudo update-grub\n\nIt will apply on next reboot.\n\nA: Sounds like either the binary nvidia drivers in 11.10 finally got KMS working or you don't actually run the binary drivers. \nThe resolution of the virtual console can not possibly slow down X11 or gaming performance. \nI'd recommend to keep the consoles at the monitors native resolution but increase the font size with sudo dpkg-reconfigure console-setup.\n", "Q: How to add different wallpapers in different workspaces but as shellscript?

What does this mean? Are there any risks? Is there a simple way to get to a non-obsolete version?\nFor example, some git and rails tutorials online direct you to install git-core. USC says that git-core is obsolete. I guess I should just install git instead?\n\nA: This will usually mean that the package has been renamed, and the one you are looking at is the old name, but kept available for a while to ensure that upgrades work as expected.\nIn the case of git the package was renamed from git-core to git, so you are right about wanting to install git.\nHowever, git-core depends on git, so installing either will get you the software you want.\n\nA: Softwares are written as to work with a given specific version of the Ubuntu, Obsolete Software may either mean that the software in the question may be Old for the current version of OS or a Newer version of the Software is available, hope i cleared your doubt. \n", "Q: does bigger SWAP partition area helps faster \"Suspend \\ hibernate \"? When I suspend my computer it stores everything on RAM on hard-disk and reloads it back to RAM when I start my computer again does this data gets stored in SWAP area ? will having a 1 GB swap partition going to help lower suspend and resume time ?\nThanks.\n\nA: No, a larger swap partition will not boost performance. When you suspend / hibernate, you copy the information RAM <--> Swap, so performance is dependent on the quantity of information you are working with, not the size of the swap.\n", "Q: Documentation for gnome shell extension development? I have been wanting to develop some Gnome Shell extensions since they are just in javascript, however I have been looking and there is practically zero documentation, everywhere I look people just say to use the basic Gnome documentation, but this does NOT help, I can not find any documentation for the imports for extensions, or any kind of javascript api for the extension development, I tried looking through some of the tutorials (most of which are for Gnome 3.0, not 3.2), but nothing is helping.\nDoes anyone know if they are in progress of writing documentation for extension development? I would really love some good documentation...\n\nA: The reason I'm not happy with the demo code and tutorials is that they introduce a bunch of random imports and never explain what they are or how to use them. I'm constructing my own answer that others can add to, so that people can actually know what functions they can call, what they can import, etc.\nThere is generated documentation for Gnome Shell, but it is somewhat incomplete — I couldn't find most of the things I saw in various tutorials, examples and published extensions.\nThe only really reliable documentation is the Gnome Shell source itself. There simply isn't any other up-to-date or complete way to know what's available.\nThese two starting points are particularly good:\n\n*\n\n*The Gnome Shell C source\n\n*The Gnome Shell JS source\nThe C source shows that there is an important object called global that doesn't need to be imported, and provides access to things like the window manager (including keybindings), the session information, the screens available and other such things. Here's the source:\n\n*\n\n*The shell-global.c source itself\n\n*The part of the source where the available properties are added\n\n*The part of the source that shows you the types of the underlying objects\nI wanted to know how to use the global.display object, and for now the best documentation is that provided by Alan Knowles.\nOther things can be imported via the GObject introspection bindings, for example:\n\n*\n\n*The Clutter UI library (imports.gi.Clutter)\n\n*GLib itself (imports.gi.GLib)\n\n*The Shell Toolkit (imports.gi.St)\n\nIn general, you can look through the reference documentation for the various Gnome components to find other imports.\nA note on the looking glass: There are some quirks about using these imports in the looking glass though — I wasted a lot of time just trying to test things out on the fly. For example:\nconst Clutter = imports.gi.Clutter;\n\n...won't work, because Clutter already exists. But then:\nconst MyClutter = imports.gi.Clutter;\n\n...also won't work; MyClutter is undefined and can't be used. You have to do:\nMyClutter = imports.gi.Clutter;\n\nOf course, in this case Clutter already exists, so it's not really necessary. But since it's not documented what is and isn't already in the looking glass namespace, if you try to import something and have these problems, keep it in mind.\nRemaining questions:\n\n*\n\n*What is Mainloop? This is imported in main.js and appears to have functions related to the GLib main loop. Is there documentation for this?\n\n*What is imports.misc? It seems to have some really useful things in there, like ExtensionUtils — what's that?\n\n*How do you use DBus? What about introspection?\n\n\nA: Documentation is lagging a bit, one potential source of information is Musings of an OS plumber, e.g. this post on updating GNOME Shell extensions to work with version 3.2\nDepending on what information you want, you might try the gnome mailing list.\n\nA: This Step by step tutorial to create extensions for gnome 3.4 may help:\nhttps://live.gnome.org/GnomeShell/Extensions/StepByStepTutorial\n", "Q: how to start a video from the terminal? The terminal is where everything gets done in linux.\nSo if this is true, how can I play an AVI video (.avi extension) from the Terminal?\n\nA: In general you start any command from a terminal by entering the command.\nSo to edit a file with gedit\ngedit file_to_edit\n\nAn .avi is no different, just a different command\nbanshee your.avi\n\nYou may use any media player you wish. \nthe only thing is an avi itself is a container, so you may need to install some codecs. codecs are the tools to play mp3 and other audio visual files.\nthis link may help\nLinuxCommand\n\nA: The syntax to open any file in its default application is\nxdg-open <file_name>\n\nIf you want to have some fun and play the video in the terminal itself, install mplayer (sudo apt-get install mplayer) and run \nmplayer -vo caca <movie_file>\n\nIt doesn't run directly in the terminal window, but it does display in ASCII characters.\n\nA: totem can be anoter option. On my fresh installed Xenial it's the app that opens movie files from nautilus.\nIt's available from Precise.\n\nA: Even arguments can be used, in terminal:\nvideoplayer-name videoplayer-arguments path-to-file\n\nPath to file can be easily entered by dragging and dropping the file onto the terminal window.\nExample, to only listen to the music of a video concert:\nmpv --no-video file-dropped-onto-terminal-window\n\n", "Q: Need to recover data from RAID5 array with just two out of three working disks When I go to bring up the array with mdadm, it complains I don't have enough components to start it.

Since doing that, however, I've been completely unable to boot into a working ubuntu system without unplugging ALL of the 2TB drives.

GB disk sdb1, and then add something like the following line to /etc/fstab:\n/dev/sdb1        /home           ext4    relatime        0       2\n\n(Of course if you formatted the second SSD as another type of filesystem, make sure you replace 'ext4' by the right one!)\nMoving those files is best done from a live CD/USB because moving them while running the system is probably not going to be liked by some applications...  But make sure you change fstab on the first SSD and not on the system running from the USB stick (or CD) then!\n\nBTW: \"joining\" multiple physical disks to 1 virtual disk can be done with LVM, but that's probably more complicated than you want right now...  (And RAID 0 is for joining two disks of the same size, so not really useful here.)\n\nA: I have the same laptop and a 4GB and 8 GB partition.\nWhen installing Ubuntu I define the /home, /tmp and /var partitions to be on the second SSD. This way there's still enough free space on the first SSD.\nJoining two SSDs into one partition is not possible.\nTheoretically a RAID 0 is a joining of 2 disks, but I have no idea if that's possible on that laptop.\n\nA: I have the same problem with eeepc.

(Most GNU programs have been done this way, and it's \"painful\" when they have not - enough for me that I would recompile them if they didn't get done \"right.\") It's a lot like learning the vi editor - once it's \"in you\" it never leaves; and, it makes working with the various programs much more proficient and enjoyable. The readline support behaves the same in whichever program was compiled with that library. How readline was implemented in an individual software program was up to the programmer(s) of that program, so mileage may vary.\nFor example, in BASH, the up arrow key recalls the previous line, and in almost any console program, [CTRL]+[U] erases everything left of the cursor while [ALT]+[F] moves forward one word and [ALT]+[B] moves backward one word, and many more...\nNslookup does have this, and sh/dash - but they are minimal.\n", "Q: GIT, SVN, Mercurial and Bazaar packages available to install (GUI & Terminal) What packages are available in Ubuntu to use the following distributed version control systems via Terminal or GUI?\n\n\n*\n\n*GIT\n\n*SVN\n\n*Mercurial\n\n*Bazaar\n\n\nA: Well, there's: \n\n\n*\n\n*git-all which gives you all the git packages [editor's note: do not attempt to install git-all in 16.04 or later, as it breaks with systemd] (or, if you want to get just the core git packages (cli only, as this skips the GUI tool) git-core.

I have an old Dell laptop with 128 MB RAM. It readily boots up and runs the Edgy Eft 6.10 liveCD. This liveCD has an old Firefox 2 on it which some websites don't like. I would also like to run Flash so I am thinking that Lubuntu is the way to go. Which version would allow install of Adobe Flash player or Google Chrome?\nthanks\n\nA: Lubuntu is the best version to start with as it is going to be the lightest on resources.\nBut, that laptop is going to run slow. You might want to look at a light weight distro such as tinycore or slitaz.\n\nA: Actually, I've tested tinycore and slitaz against Lubuntu on my 12 year old laptop and Lubuntu is faster than slitaz(installed on the actual laptop) and tinycore is cumbersome as hell and uses 64mb of ram (with nothing extra installed) off the back while Lubuntu runs at 58mb even if installation requires 128mb. I suggest using a 10.04 version of Lubuntu as your interface base (version you install) then using sudo apt-get update & sudo apt-get upgrade and sudo dist-upgrade to update the core images. The new versions of the interface have unnecessary items due to their recent joining of the ubuntu family.\n\nA: Lubuntu works quite nicely on old computers.  On my old computer I have found the fastest web browser is Opera (which is not available in the repos.  Next is Midori which only barely beats Firefox, and last is Chrome (not sure why it is so slow... most people find it to be fast).  So I would highly suggest using Opera as your browser because it loads in less than half the time.  http://www.opera.com/  I would also suggest installing http://www.xnoise-media-player.com/ xnoise for your main music program.  It loads almost as fast as Audacious, but is much prettier than Rhythmbox and Banshee.  It doesn't support mp3 players quite yet or CDs... but it is loads fast and is beautiful for digital music.

I usually crop and tag the photos when I'm back in front of the computer, and each time I save a change the entire file uploads again.\nSide note: The original photos shot on the mobile don't get updated, so I periodically wipe them from the phone's memory and copy the edited ones back to it from the computer. If you use the Ubuntu One Files app for Android be aware of this.\n", "Q: Update all packages of 11.04, then upgrade to 11.10 or upgrade to 11.10 without updating packages? NOTE - Title should be changed to something more into what am asking...\nThere are 2 cases I have seen when upgrading someone from the previous version of Ubuntu to the latest.\n\n\n*\n\n*When the user has not even done an update for a while so now he/she has the updates for that version of Ubuntu and also the Distribution upgrade pending.\n\n*The user is up to date with all the updates for that particular version of Ubuntu and only needs to upgrade to the new distribution version.\nI always recommend updating every package and THEN upgrading to the new distribution (Just in case, maybe it's me but I feel safer this way. It is more logical I guess). But what would happened or if it possible to upgrade to the latest distribution without first updating the packages for the version of Ubuntu used in that case. Let us put a scenario:\nSam has 11.04 updated until August. After that he simply decided not to keep updating the 11.04 packages. 11.10 arrives and now the big NEW 11.10 DISTRIBUTION VERSION AVAILABLE!!! DOWNLOAD NOW!! FREE WITH 2 BEERS FROM BRUNO PEREIRA!. So now Sam has 2 options, either update all packages of 11.04 and the upgrade to 11.10 or just upgrade to 11.10. What positive/negative feedback can Sam get with using one of the 2 forms.\n\nA: Well, as you probably know, upgrades of any OS should not be done lightly and you want them to go as smooth as possible.\nHonestly my advice is :\n\n\n*\n\n*Back up your data first. This includes making a list of all installed packages, $HOME, and any configuration files you manually edited in /etc/ or elsewhere. Server side it is going to include backing up databases and configuration files. See this link for details on generating a package list\n\n*Read the release notes. The release notes list known problems and give advice. Oneiric Release Notes\n\n*I always boot the new version as a live CD first. I want to identify any potential problems with my hardware BEFORE I upgrade.\n\n*To answer your question, yes I always upgrade all the packages installed on the system first, then upgrade the distribution. sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get dist-upgrade -> reboot -> then upgrade to new release.\nIf all those steps seem like too much hassle, it is often easier to make a separate /home partition, back up /home, test the new version, and do a fresh install.\nSkipping any of the above steps is, IMO, asking for problems.\n", "Q: Why does my machine suddenly not allow the \"sudo\" command? I was working on my machine.

Please help I need these files back!\nUpdate\nI used the Windows back-up utility that came installed. I can view all the files on my external that I used in .zip folders but when I unzip them they're strewn about randomly and in invalid formats\n\nA: You will need to reinstall a Windows Machine, either in a program such as Virtual Box, or on the physical hardware.\nTo install in Virtual Box, follow these instructions (they are a little dated, but good enough to know how to install it.)\nTo install Windows on your actual machine, follow these instructions.\nYou then need to follow the instructions provided by Microsoft to use the recovery program Windows 7 has - found here.\n\nA: Without knowing what kind of backup, a reasonable method for this is to install software that will allow you to use Windows as a virtual machine on top of your Ubuntu installation - perhaps with Virtual Box. After installing this, you can then install Windows 7 as a virtual machine. And, when Windows 7 has been installed, use could then use your backup as you might on non-virtual Windows.\n", "Q: MythTV works OK but other sounds do not with nVidia HDMI, what to do?

In my web development work, I use Ubuntu almost exclusively. But there are occasions where I need to boot up Windows -- to check a layout in IE, to reslice a comp in Photoshop -- and I want to be able to share my entire localhost environment between the two.\nHere's my current workflow:\nIn Ubuntu:\n\n\n*\n\n*rsync the directory of the site I'm working on from /var/www to /windows/wamp/www (where /windows is the mount location of my windows NTFS partition as set in fstab).\n\n*rsync the mysql database from /var/lib/mysql to /windows/wamp/bin/mysql/{mysql version}/data.\n\n\nShut down, boot Windows, edit files, save, restart again. Back in Ubuntu, look for changed files and rsync back to /var/www, ignoring the permissions changes that have happened when moving the files to the NTFS partition.\nI don't like keeping two copies of my entire development environment, and I don't like having to manually sync them. Ideally I'd like to copy my entire /var/www folder into the Windows partition and symlink to it, and do the same thing for my databases. But the permissions changes that happen cause no end of headaches when doing that.\nSo my question is two-part, I guess:\n\n\n*\n\n*Is there any way of copying files from ext4 drive partitions to NTFS partitions that maintains the Unix permissions in a way that they can be synced back?\n\n\nor,\n\n\n*\n\n*Is there a better way of sharing the entire localhost environment between Windows and Linux partitions?\n\n\nA: If the partition is being shared with ubuntu and windows, you can use ntfs-3g.usermap to create a user map file.\nAssume the partition is /dev/sdXn mounted at /NTFS\n1) umount the partition\nsudo umount /dev/sdXn\n\n2) run ntfs-3g.usermap (it will create a file UserMapping at current directory)\n sudo ntfs-3g.usermap /dev/sdXn\n\n3) remount\nsudo mount /dev/sdXn\n\n4)* copy UserMapping file\nsudo mkdir /NTFS/.NTFS-3G\nsudo cp UserMapping /NTFS.NTFS-3G/\n\nNow everything should work. At least it worked for me in Ubuntu 11.10\nThe latest (23.12.2015) Tuxera page suggest the copying to /.NTFS-3G/:\n\nThe resulting mapping file is written on file UserMapping in the current directory. For the file to be usable, first mount the volume, then copy UserMapping to /.NTFS-3G/UserMapping in the mounted directory, then unmount the volume and mount it again.\n\nSo something like this:\nsudo mkdir /.NTFS-3G\nsudo cp UserMapping /.NTFS-3G/\n\n\nA: Well you have a few options. \nFirst, you can try the fsdriver\nhttp://sourceforge.net/projects/ext2read/\nI do not know how well that driver will work, but if it does I would go that route as you use primarily Ubuntu.\nThe other option is to mount your ntfs partiton with linux permissions. You will need to add a line in fstab similar to \nUUID=12102C02102CEB83  /media/windows  ntfs-3g  auto,users,permissions  0  0\n\nChange your uuid to your windows partition ( use sudo blkid )\nAssuming that works you can use a link or mount bind (again, an entry in fstab)\n/media/windows/www /var/www none defaults,bind 0 0 \n\nThe disadvantage of the second method is ubuntu is not going to debug a ntfs partition if there is a problem with the file system.\nEdit: One other potential solution - Run Windows in Virtualbox (or KVM) and use a shared folder or network share (samba).\nGood luck\n\nA: This worked for me on Lubuntu 15.10\n\n*\n\n*Open a terminal\n\n\nctrl+alt+t\n\n\n\n*Unmount the ntfs drive (replace sdx with your drive; mine is sda3)\n\n\nsudo umount /dev/sdx\n\n\n\n*Edit fstab so ntfs-3g is used (ubuntu comes with leafpad installed; in other ditro's you might use gedit or a different text editor)\n\n\nsudo leafpad /etc/fstab\n\n\n\n*Change from ntfs to ntfs-3g. Something like this:\n\n\n#Entry for /dev/sdx :\nUUID=3844444444004444 /mnt/diskname   ntfs-3g default,auto 0 0\n\n\n\n*Save and close\n\n\n*Mount all drives\n\nsudo mount -a\n\n\n\n*Open a file browser with root rights. (lubutu comes with pcmanfm installed however for other distributions you might have another file browser installed)\n\n\nsudo pcmanfm\n\n\n\n*Navigate to the folder you want and right click on it the File Proprieties  window should open. Go to the Permissions tab and choose what you need.\n\n\n\n\n*Click OK then everything should be just the way you want.

Coal miners used canaries to detect dangerous gases (if the canary they carried with them died, they knew they had to get out of the shaft/mine ASAP).  As a result the term \"canary\" is now often used for anything that you use to get an (early) warning about a dangerous situation.\nIn this case it seems like 'rtkit' starts a \"normal\" thread to test if the threads that get \"real time\" priorities are \"starving\" other threads (& processes), where \"starving\" means that they get too little processor time.  This is a safety measure to make sure that processes/threads that have access to real time priorities don't use up so much CPU time that other tasks get none anymore.\nSo apparently some thread(s) that got real-time priorities from rtkit is/are misbehaving, and trying to monopolize the CPU, rtkit detects this with its \"canary thread\", and thus rtkit takes away the real-time priorities.\n\nA: It is a buffer overflow\nWikipedia buffer overflow canaries\nI can not tell from the logs you posted where the problem is, can you check or pastebin log entries above an below those messages ?

But in 11.10, how can I correctly enable desktop cube in Unity 3D?\n\nA: *\n\n*Install compizconfig-settings-manager\nsudo apt-get install compizconfig-settings-manager\n\n\n*Run ccsm, see these screenshots\n\n\n\n*Log out and back in.\n\n*If that fails, try \"resetting\" your compiz settings\nrm -rf .gconf/apps/compiz*\nrm -rf .cache/compizconfig-1/\nrm -rf .config/compiz-1/\nrm -rf .compiz*\n\nLog out and repeat the above steps.\n\nSource : http://ubuntuguide.net/enable-compiz-desktop-cube-in-ubuntu-11-10-oneiric-unity\n\nA: This is what I invented and tested with more than 20 PCs. Note that you actually NEED a video card that can render this and to have the drivers correctly installed. Look for the answer in the following links to install the drivers correctly:\nHow do I install the Nvidia drivers? \nHow can I update my NVIDIA driver? \nCan not install Nvidia driver \nWhat's the difference between the nvidia-current, and nvidia-current-updates packages?   \n\n\n*\n\n*Install Compiz Config Settings Manager\n(Note: What are some of the issues with CCSM and why would I want to avoid it?)\nsudo apt-get install compizconfig-settings-manager\n\nNOTE: If you have 12.10 or above you need to also install the compiz-plugin package. So instead of the final terminal line mentioned above, it would be:\nsudo apt-get install compizconfig-settings-manager compiz-plugins compiz-plugins-extra\n\nIf you do not install the compiz-plugins you will not see the cube or rotate plugins in the compiz plugin list.\n\n*Open Compiz Config Settings Manager and go to Preferences\n\n\n\n*Select Plugin List Tab\n\n\n*Disable Automatic Plugin Sorting and accept the warning that will appear after trying to disable it.\n\n*From the Disable Plugins List, Enable the following plugins: cube, rotate\n\n*From the Enable Plugins List, Disable the following plugins: wall\n\n*Go back from the Preferences menu to the Main Compiz Menu and select General Options\n\n\n*Go to Desktop Size tab and change the Horizontal and Vertical Virtual Size to 4:\nHow it looks in 12.04 or below\n\nHow it looks in 12.10+\n\nDONE\nThere is no need to restart the PC or logout or anything additional to this steps. In this case it works on Nvidia, Ati and Intel cards.\nIf you want to add more Effects you would do them in the Preference options but you need to be careful which Plugins have problems with others. In this case they are working excellent.\nHOW TO TEST IF IT IS WORKING?\nSimply leave CTRL+ALT pressed and then with the Arrow keys press -> or <- to rotate Right or Left, respectively.\nYou can also (If you mouse has support for a third middle button), leave the middle button pressed while in the desktop (Without selecting anything else) and move your mouse around.\nI will need to test it even further to say that it is stable but so far am typing this with the Cube effect activated, could drag a video I was watching to another virtual desktop and no problems.\nOn 12.04 watching Family Guy\n\nOn 12.10 watching Game of Throne + AskUbuntu\n\nOn 13.04 watching (actually crying) Fringe:\n\nLastly, you can just download My Compiz Profile to import using the CCSM Import option and have the configuration that is mentioned in this post.\nHOW TO GO BACK TO DEFAULT?\nIf this is giving you any video errors or glitches, then you need to go back to the defaults. I would try to run ccsm again and simply put the \"Wall\" plugin back from Disabled to Enabled in the Preferences Menu and then Activate the \"Automatic Plugin Sorting\". Or just set all plugins to automatic by enabling the Automatic Plugin Sorting option again. Now logout/login just in case any of them gives an error or weird behavior. If you can't open the Compiz Settings Manager go to the terminal and type ccsm.\nOptions to reset Compiz and/or Unity to default (In case of an error) are:\n\n\n*\n\n*For 12.04 and Below - unity --reset\n\n*For 12.10 - How do I reset my Unity configuration?\n\n*For 13.04+ - unity-tweak-tool --reset-unity\n\n*Remove Launcher Custom Icons - unity --reset-icons\nUPDATE - Confirmed working on at least 10 PCs and 5 Laptops.

My concern is that some problem with either Ubuntu or Windows would make it so the respective bootloader won't work and the operating system that is perfectly fine won't be able to be accessed because of the failure of one of the bootloaders.\nSo, I was wondering if there is a general consensus as to which bootloader to have in charge.  Thanks in advance.\nEDIT: So one bootloader is not inherently more secure than the other?  I have read that holding shift on boot makes Grub appear but would this be the case even if something happened to the Ubuntu install?  Or do I not have much to worry about because Ubuntu is pretty stable, as long as I stay with the 6 month release cycle?\n\nA: Depends, both work well, use the one you feel most comfortable with.\nIf you want support from the Linux / Ubuntu community , use grub.\nIf you use the windows boot loader, your support will be either Microsoft or the Windows community.\n\nA: I personally would recommend GRUB to you as it automatically detects all installed OS (as you can see) and has more options (I mean possibilities to configure it as you want). By the way it definitely looks nicer, especially when you personalized it using Grub-customizer. It's a GUI tool for Ubuntu that makes the configuration super easy. Just google how to install it (3 lines of terminal input) and have fun. You can rename entries, put them in subdirectories, configure the screen resolution, fonts, colors, background image, delay, default option etc....\nAnd it is a free open-source software which is (almost) always better than commercial stuff (personal opinion). Besides, as you recently installed Ubuntu, GRUB is your current bootloader anyway, why should you change it? You still can do this (using a rescue bootcd/stick) when/if ever something happened. \nAdditionally, my personal experience is, that it is much easier to make Windows fail booting than Linux. This usually does not mainly depend on the bootloader but on what happens later, but you see what I mean...\n\nA: I've been dual booting using grub on 7 systems (actually 5 different people / families) for a couple of years, have been through several upgrades.  Some of them keep a version for 3 releases then have to do multiple upgrades at the same time.  I have personally never had a problem and since all these systems just have the non Ubuntu OS available because it was installed anyway and will only be used on rare occasions we stick with grub and Ubuntu as the default boot.  I always take comfort from knowing that unless the hard drive totally dies, I can rescue either system (the data anyway) using an Ubuntu live boot with my handy USB.  \nAs a side note I should mention that recently a installed Ubuntu for someone who wanted to seriously try it but wanted Windows as the default and found that Startup Manager is really handy for making this change.\n\nA: The windows boot manager will show only the windows versions of os only but not the other\nWhere as the GRUB will show all the operating systems present the hard disk my my advice is to use only GRUB.\n", "Q: Recovery of deleted folders in home folder By accident I've removed some folders (they were empty) in my home folder. I've created a new ones but they doesn't have proper icons etc... how can I recreate them step by step?\n\nA: OK, to restore deleted directories\nedit ~/.config/user-dirs.dirs , \ngedit ~/.config/user-dirs.dirs\n\nit should look like this:\n# This file is written by xdg-user-dirs-update\n# If you want to change or add directories, just edit the line you're\n# interested in.

You will need to boot a live CD and try recovery from there.\nI have had mixed, generally poor results with the ext4 file system, but try , in order, testdisk and then photorec. Both are in the repositories and both can be installed in the live session\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get install testdisk\n\nYou then run testdisk from the command line\n# you might be able to run it as a user, but I would run it as root\nsudo testdisk\n\nThere is a step-by-step tutorial , with screen shots, here\nhttp://www.cgsecurity.org/wiki/TestDisk:_undelete_file_for_ext2\nIf that fails, try photorec.\nPhotorec is a part of the testdisk package, again there is a detailed walk through here\nhttp://www.cgsecurity.org/wiki/PhotoRec_Step_By_Step\nIf that fails, you can try extundelete\nhttp://extundelete.sourceforge.net/\nLast time I tried that, it did not recover my files.\nGood luck.\n", "Q: wireless connects to internet but wired does not, both connect to gateway untangle firewall, what to do? My home LAN is set up with fixed IP addresses and an Untangle gateway/firewall/DNS server with Internet access.\nOne of my computers (Ubuntu 10.10) will connect to the Internet only through the wireless, but reports \"network is unreachable\" when connected to wired.  Even though it will not connect to the internet, it will connect to other computers on the LAN, including the gateway when using the wired connection..\nMy laptop (11.10) and another system (10.10) connect either way.\nI use the same IP address for both wired and wireless on the same computer, and always disable wireless when using wired.  The laptop uses wicd because Network Manager fails on it.\nI would like to be able to connect to the Internet using wired connection, how can I do this?\n\nA: The wireless and wired will have different MAC addresses, and may be retaining the association with that (reused) IP address for a finite time. ( ? 12 hours )\nWhy not use a different IP address?\nOr, you could use DHCP for clients, and assign IP addresses at gateway.\n\nA: In a desperate attempt to get this working, I did the following:\n\n\n*\n\n*Using Synaptic, I re-installed network manager.\n\n*I edited connections in Network Manager; first deleting the wired connection, then adding a new connection with the same parameters (IP address, netmask, gateway and DNS server).\n\n\nImmediately the system connected to the LAN using the wired connection with internet access.

You either work with both with buggy bumblebee or disable the discrete card.\nOptimus tecnology doesnt allow you to choose between both of them. The IGP is the one displaying the video, the discrete cards only is turned on when is required (heavy load scenario), but the IGP is the one displaying the video on the screen always.\nNvidia is not interested in bringing Optimus to Linux, due a lot of work needed in the X and the few percentage of us using Linux.\nMy advice is if you are gonna buy a Sandy Bridge, buy a laptop without a discrete card and save some money, or at least, an ATI card.

In Ubuntu, however, my network interface periodically dies and resets itself; I'll have a solid connection for 30 seconds, and then it will go out for 30 seconds. When I tail the log:\ntail -f /var/log/kern.log\n\nI see \"eth0 link up\" messages appear periodically, corresponding with the return of connectivity.\nI posted the original question months ago, and misinterpreted what was going on. With a working Internet connection in Windows, I ignored the problem for some months. See my answer below for the solution (drivers).\nORIGINAL POST\nIn Ubuntu, although I maintain a solid connection to my LAN (pinging the router IP address consistently returns a good result), my internet connectivity drops in and out. When I continuously ping 74.125.227.18 (a google.com server), I get responses for a while, then I start getting \"Destination Host Unreachable\" for a while, then I get responses again. This happens consistently, dropping the connection for about 30 seconds out of every minute or two.\nWhether I configure my network via the network manager or via /etc/network/interfaces seems to make no difference. I configure with the following settings:\n\n\n*\n\n*address  192.168.1.101\n\n*network  192.168.1.0\n\n*gateway  192.168.1.99   (my router's IP address)\n\n*netmask  255.255.255.0  (confirmed as the right netmask for the router)\n\n*broadcast  192.168.1.255  (also confirmed with the router).\n\n\nifconfig confirms that these settings are working:\neth0      Link encap:Ethernet  HWaddr 50:e5:49:40:da:a6  \n          inet addr:192.168.1.101  Bcast:192.168.1.255  Mask:255.255.255.0\n          inet6 addr: fe80::52e5:49ff:fe40:daa6/64 Scope:Link\n          UP BROADCAST RUNNING MULTICAST  MTU:1500  Metric:1\n          RX packets:11557 errors:0 dropped:11557 overruns:0 frame:11557\n          TX packets:13117 errors:0 dropped:211 overruns:0 carrier:0\n          collisions:0 txqueuelen:1000 \n          RX bytes:9551488 (9.5 MB)  TX bytes:1930952 (1.9 MB)\n          Interrupt:41 Base address:0xa000\n\nI get the same issue when I use automatic DHCP address settings, although I did confirm that there is no other machine on the network with the static IP address I want to use.\nAs I said, the connection to the local network stays solid - I never have any trouble pinging 192.168.1.* - it's internet addresses that I intermittently cannot reach. It's not a DNS issue because pinging known IP addresses directly shows the same behavior. Also, I don't think it's a hardware issue, as I never have any internet connectivity problems on the same machine in Windows. The network hardware is built into the motherboard: Gigabyte Z68XP-UD3P.\nI managed to bring the OS fully up to date, according to the update manager, but it didn't fix the issue, and with my limited understanding of network architecture I'm at my wit's end. The only clue I can see is that ifconfig is reporting a lot of dropped packets, but I'm not sure what to do about it.\nUPDATE:\nIt seems my problem is a little more generic than I described; now when I try pinging my router and google simultaneously, they both go unreachable at the same time. Running ifdown eth0 and then ifup eth0 brings it back temporarily; if I just wait it comes back after a couple of minutes. I'll broaden my search through intermittent network connectivity problems.\n\nA: The solution was to install the proper drivers for my ethernet adapter, which is built into my motherboard. I checked the model and version of my adapter, and the version of my Linux kernel:\n$ lspci | grep Ethernet\n07:00.0 Ethernet controller: Realtek Semiconductor Co., Ltd. RTL8111/8168B PCI Express Gigabit Ethernet controller (rev 06)\n$ uname -r\n3.0.0-15-generic\n\nthen went to the driver download page for the manufacturer:\nhttp://www.realtek.com/Downloads/downloadsView.aspx?Langid=1&PNid=13&PFid=5&Level=5&Conn=4&DownTypeID=3&GetDown=fa\nand downloaded the driver that matched best. I was a little hesitant since uname reported a more recent kernel version than the drivers explicitly support, but I installed it with the autorun command in the downloaded package and everything seems to run fine.\nMoral of the story: don't assume as I did that Linux comes pre-packaged with all the drivers you'll need.\n\nA: It can be several things:\n\n\n*\n\n*disk hardware failure, like I/O errors, can cause net to go off because it fails to store data from browser.\n\n*firewall blocking traffic, should have a rule to allow out tcp 25,53,80,110,443 and also allow out udp 53.\n\n*if you have multiple firewalls programs, running simultaneous, that can also became a problem, like ufw and gufw, it is better to use only gufw...\n\nA: I just ran into a similar problem.\nIn my case, ifconfig showed no dropped or overrun packets, but 'route' showed a bogus route through a broken wlan0 device:\nKernel IP routing table\nDestination     Gateway         Genmask         Flags Metric Ref    Use Iface\ndefault         192.168.0.1     0.0.0.0         UG    0      0        0 eth0\ndefault         192.168.0.1     0.0.0.0         UG    100    0        0 wlan0\nlink-local      *               255.255.0.0     U     1000   0        0 eth0\n192.168.0.0     *               255.255.255.0   U     0      0        0 wlan0\n192.168.0.0     *               255.255.255.0   U     1      0        0 eth0\n\nDoing 'sudo ifconfig wlan0 down' worked around the problem for me.\nI filed https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/network-manager/+bug/917399\nfor this. \n\nA: I had a very similar problem to yours and found the answer here: http://www.avsforum.com/avs-vb/showthread.php?p=21371318\nI turned off my PC and unplugged it for a few minutes then pressed the power button for a few seconds, still unplugged, and let it sit for a few more minutes and then plugged it in and powered it back on.

Ubuntu's Terminal uses case-sensitive auto-completion, as would be expected for Linux.\nBut I think sometimes it would be more convenient to use a case-insensitive one instead, to save you having to be accurate while starting a name, and would probably be worth the extra false positives.  Is it possible to change this behaviour?\n\nA: You can do this by setting a configuration variable for GNU readline, which is what handles the input in an interactive shell.\nThe variable needed is completion-ignore-case, and can be set directly in your bash session with:\nbind \"set completion-ignore-case on\"\n\nIt can be enabled for all future bash sessions by putting set completion-ignore-case on into the users's ~/.inputrc file, or the system /etc/inputrc, to enable it for all users.  This is the initialisation file for readline.\nNote that ~/.inputrc probably doesn't exist, and if you create it, your local version will override the system version at /etc/inputrc.  The system version has lots of useful key mappings configured, such as Ctrl-Left/Right, and you have to link in the system version so you don't lose them.\nThe way to do this is to put the line $include /etc/inputrc at the top of ~/.inputrc, e.g.:\n$include /etc/inputrc\n\nset completion-ignore-case on\n\nOnce configured, you can apply the change, either by restarting bash, or reload inputrc, e.g. with Ctrlx,Ctrlr.)\nMore information about readline and inputrc can be found in man bash and man 3 readline.\n\nA: Open a terminal and type the below command:\necho set completion-ignore-case on | sudo tee -a /etc/inputrc\n\nEnter password. Restart terminal.\nIf in some case you want to remove case insensitive, just edit /etc/inputrc file by removing the set completion-ignore-case line.\nThat's all.\n\nA: In order to make bash case-insensitive for to current user:\nRun the following shell script in a terminal:\n# If ~/.inputrc doesn't exist yet: First include the original /etc/inputrc\n# so it won't get overriden\nif [ ! -a ~/.inputrc ]; then echo '$include /etc/inputrc' > ~/.inputrc; fi\n\n# Add shell-option to ~/.inputrc to enable case-insensitive tab completion\necho 'set completion-ignore-case On' >> ~/.inputrc\n\nStart a new shell (reopen the terminal).\nTo Make the changes systemwide:\n# add option to /etc/inputrc to enable case-insensitive tab completion for all users\necho 'set completion-ignore-case On' >> /etc/inputrc\n# you may have to use this instead if you are not a superuser:\necho 'set completion-ignore-case On' | sudo tee -a /etc/inputrc\n\nFor details, see man bash . Yes it is a long page, but bash is a somewhat complex program, and if you want just search that page for \"case-insensitive\" to go to the relevant section. People usually learn bash one option at a time or one bash script at a time and it takes a long time to master all the nuances. Your interest may vary.\n\nA: I know this question is very old but unless I am missing something I think I have a super simple solution if you are using bash. \necho \"bind 'set completion-ignore-case on'\" >> ~/.bashrc\n\nOr just add the line using your favorite text editor. Restart your bash session and enjoy. \n", "Q: Trouble getting ruby on rails running on 11.10 (RVM + Passenger + Apache2) I am running into some issues getting my RoR production server up and running using rvm, passenger, and apache2.

It should mount and then close. The only time it hangs is when the mount can't go through, AFAIK. Consider using -v in your mount options to see the exact problem.\nI think you want to try sudo umount -f /media/634bad56-5543-40fe-843b-cd31f4a95dba_ and if that doesn't work: sudo umount -l /media/634bad56-5543-40fe-843b-cd31f4a95dba_. I would hope the kernel would see the unmount and would stop the previous mount operation.\nAlso if this is a mount from your /etc/fstab, you might want to consider using UUIDs instead of \"/dev/sdxn\" devices which can change name between boots.\n\nA: I believe that processes in brackets are ones that are started by kernel threads and as such are critical to system function.  In this case, jbd2 is the journaling block device, which is required if you want to use your hard drive.  \nWhy do you want to kill this process?\n\nA: The process is in an uninterruptible sleep and therefore cannot be killed.\nFrom wikipedia\n\nAn uninterruptible sleep state is a sleep state that won't handle a\n  signal right away. It will wake only as a result of a waited-upon\n  resource becoming available or after a time-out occurs during that\n  wait (if specified when put to sleep). It is mostly used by device\n  drivers waiting for disk or network IO (input/output). When the\n  process is sleeping uninterruptibly, signals accumulated during the\n  sleep will be noticed when the process returns from the system call or\n  trap.\n\nSo I would check the hard disk and partition for errors.\n", "Q: How do I kill a kernel thread? And do I really want to do so? As I've learned from this question, [bracketed] processes listed by the ps aux command are kernel threads. So is there a way to kill them from the command line? If not, I guess the reason for that is to save the user from a higher risk of getting a kernel panic, right?\n\nA: You can not kill kernel threads, or any process that is blocked in the D state, because signals are only delivered when the kernel returns to user mode.  Aside from the technical limitation of signal delivery, killing a thread in the middle of kernel code would corrupt the system as the kernel code may be holding an important resource at the time, such as a spin lock or mutex, and killing it would prevent those resources from being released.\nIf you have a process that is stuck in the D state for a prolonged period of time, then you have a kernel bug.  See https://wiki.ubuntu.com/KernelTeam/KernelTeamBugPolicies for tips on reporting it.\n\nA: Kernel threads are necessary threads created by your Kernel to manage your system.\nNot all are necessary but all (most) all beneficial and require mostly no extra resources, there is no reason why one would under normal conditions think about killing a Kernel thread.\nLinux Kernel can create an destroy those threads when necessary, you should not worry about them and killing under most circumstances is not something you can do.\n", "Q: Install web site in Ubuntu Server using Samba I've installed Ubuntu Server in VirtualBox running on Windows for someone to test a CMS.

It’s not a package manager so it doesn’t keep track of the files it installs. This makes it difficult to uninstall the files afterwards.\nThe make install command copies the built program and packages into the library directory and specified locations from the makefile. These locations can vary based on the examination that’s performed by the configure script.\nCheckInstall\nCheckInstall is a program that’s used to install or uninstall programs that are compiled from the source code. It monitors and copies the files that are installed using the make program. It also installs the files using the package manager which allows it to be uninstalled like any regular package.\nThe checkinstall command is calls the make install command. It monitors the files that are installed and creates a binary package from them. It also installs the binary package with the Linux package manager.\nReplace source_location.deb and name in the screenshot with your own information:\n\nExecute the following commands in the source package directory:\n\n*\n\n*Install CheckInstall\nsudo apt-get install checkinstall\n\n\n\n*Run the Configure script\n./configure\n\n\n\n*Run the Make command\nmake\n\n\n\n*Run CheckInstall\nsudo checkinstall\n\n\n\n*Reinstall the package\nsudo dpkg --install --force-overwrite source_location.deb\n\n\n*Remove the package\nsudo apt remove name\nHere's an article I wrote that goes through the entire process with explanations.\n\nA: It is not a bug, it is what happens when developers resort to distribution via source and not via the native packaging methods.\nYou can get your source files to become debian packages by using checkinstall or dhbuild.\nHonestly, in my opinion - new users should avoid installing from source, and developers should avoid distributing by source only.\n\nA: I do not think this is a bug, it would be a good idea to read about and learn to use checkinstall when installing from source.\nyou can install checkinstall from the repositories, a short description of the package;\nCheckInstall keeps track of all the files created or\nmodified by your installation script (\"make install\"\n\"make install_modules\", \"setup\", etc), builds a\nstandard binary package and installs it in your\nsystem giving you the ability to uninstall it with your\ndistribution's standard package management utilities.\nThese links below may be helpful to get a better understanding.\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CheckInstall\nhttp://checkinstall.izto.org/\n\nA: We need to negotiate the fact that make uninstall would not always work, so below\nis more of a proactive solution.\n This involves the use of the paco program\nwhich is available in the Ubuntu Software Center. Once we have installed paco,\nwe can use it the log mode when we \"make install\" a program. Paco acts like a wrapper for your \"make install\" and creates a log in the /var/log/paco directory with  the list of files copied to various directories. Moreover, you could see the the files in the Paco Front end. For example when I compiled php from source I did the following :\npaco -lp php5 \"make install\"\n\nThe parameter l makes the paco run in the log mode.This created a log file in /var/log/paco named php5 (the name I have given in the command). It contained all the files which are copied to various standard locations during the install. You could use a command line editor or paco gui to view the files. Below is the example of getting\nthe file list using sed command line editor(Replace php5 with your filename).\ncat /var/log/paco/php5 | sed -n 's/|\\(.*\\)//;/^#\\(.*\\)/d;p'\n\nOnce you got the list of the files, you know how to delete them don't you? Indeed, you could pass the results of the above command to rm using backticks like shown below:\nsudo rm `cat /var/log/paco/php5 | sed -n 's/|\\(.*\\)//;/^#\\(.*\\)/d;p'`\n\nJob done!\nNote : Due to LD_PRELOAD limitations, paco can't follow the trace of suid programs. See man page.\n\nA: Usually you can just use:\nmake uninstall\n\nor\nsudo make uninstall\n\nif the app was installed as root.\nBut this will work only if the developer of the package has taken care of making a good uninstall rule.\nYou can also try to get a look at the steps used to install the software by running:\nmake -n install\n\nAnd then try to reverse those steps manually.\nIn the future to avoid that kind of problems try to use checkinstall instead of make install whenever possible (AFAIK always unless you want to keep both the compiled and a packaged version at the same time). It will create and install a deb file that you can then uninstall using your favorite package manager.\nmake clean usually cleans the building directories, it doesn't uninstall the package. It's used when you want to be sure that the whole thing is compiled, not just the changed files.\n\nA: I know of few packages that support \"make uninstall\" but many more that support make install DESTDIR=xxx\" for staged installs.\nYou can use this to create a package which you install instead of installing directly from the source. I had no luck with checkinstall but fpm works very well.\nThis can also help you remove a package previously installed using make install. You simply force install your built package over the make installed one and then uninstall it.\nFor example, I used this recently to deal with protobuf-3.3.0.\nOn RHEL7:\nmake install DESTDIR=dest\ncd dest\nfpm -f -s dir -t rpm -n protobuf -v 3.3.0 \\\n --vendor \"You Not RedHat\" \\\n --license \"Google?\" \\\n --description \"protocol buffers\" \\\n --rpm-dist el7 \\\n -m you@youraddress.com \\\n --url \"http:/somewhere/where/you/get/the/package/oritssource\" \\\n --rpm-autoreqprov \\\n usr\n\n sudo rpm -i -f protobuf-3.3.0-1.el7.x86_64.rpm\n sudo rpm -e protobuf-3.3.0      \n\nPrefer yum to rpm if you can.\nOn Debian9:\nmake install DESTDIR=dest\ncd dest\nfpm -f -s dir -t deb -n protobuf -v 3.3.0 \\\n-C `pwd` \\\n--prefix / \\\n--vendor \"You Not Debian\" \\\n--license \"$(grep Copyright ../../LICENSE)\" \\\n--description \"$(cat README.adoc)\" \\\n--deb-upstream-changelog ../../CHANGES.txt \\\n --url \"http:/somewhere/where/you/get/the/package/oritssource\" \\\n usr/local/bin \\\n usr/local/lib \\\n usr/local/include\n\n sudo apt install -f *.deb\n sudo apt-get remove protobuf\n\nPrefer apt to dpkg where you can.\nI've also posted this answer on stackoverflow\n\nA: If you user make install and make uninstall doesn't work you can manually remove installed files.\nStop redis service:\nservice redis_6379 stop\n\nNow delete everything related to Redis server from /usr/local/bin/:\nrm /usr/local/bin/redis-*\n\nDelete Redis Configuration files directory:\nrm -r /etc/redis/\n\nDelete existing Redis data directory:\nrm -r /var/lib/redis/\n\nDelete existing Redis server init scripts:\nrm /etc/init.d/redis_*\n\nRemove existing Redis PID files (Only if exists):\nrm /var/run/redis_*\n\nRestart your server and now Redis is completely removed from your Server.\n\nA: Also if you have installed a source with traditional method, you can reinstall the package placing yourself in the same directory from where you have runned sudo make install, running sudo checkinstall.\nYou will can then uninstall it by simply typing sudo apt-get purge $program_name\n\nA: This is not a bug - compiling from source is an unsupported method of installing software that bypasses the package management system (which is used by the Software Centre) completely. \nThere is no standard way that software compiled from source is installed or uninstalled so no way Ubuntu can know what to do. The software is not even listed as an installed program. \nYou should follow the distributor's instructions for installation and removal of such custom software. You could also contact the developer to ask for them to create a Debian package so that the package management system can be used.\n\nA: I had compiled php-5.6.30 from source without configuring it with openssl, so I had to go back and install it from scratch.Using make uninstall did not work as the Makefile for php doesn't support it.\nHowever, this step worked for me, - I listed all the files related to php and removed them manually, it took me about 5 minutes without breaking a sweat. You can similarly use these steps to uninstall your compiled software.\nReplace php with the software you need to uninstall\nwhereis php\nThe above command lists directories where the binaries are installed ex: /usr/local/bin/php, /usr/bin/php .. remove each file/directory listed in your output.\nsudo rm -f  /usr/local/bin/php \nDo this with all the files listed in the above output and you are all set to install the newer version from scratch.\n", "Q: How can I configure a fax server?

There are some very ugly workarounds that I have tried myself that can make the artifacts go away but (in the case of minecraft, at least) do not help the screen flickering.\n\nEDIT: Here's the workaround I crafted up. Firstly, you'll need a newer version of intel-gpu-tools to tweak some data. Go here to pick up a newer version. You may add the PPA but to avoid a lot of unnecessary updates I recommend just manually downloading the package through \"View Package Details\", then expand the dropdown entry for the oneiric series and download either the AMD64 or i386 package, depending on whether you have 32 or 64 bit.

So just install the default package, gcc or g++, and it will also install gcc 4.5 or g++ 4.5 respectively. If you prefer you can just install gcc-4.5 directly. So either\napt-get install gcc\n\nor\napt-get install gcc-4.5\n\nshould work, if you really just want gcc (as opposed to g++ for example).\n", "Q: Will there be a better alternative than Uniy in future? I'm running Ubuntu for a long time and many of my students at our University switched from Windows to your great OS after my lessons.\nBut after that forced update to Unity you lost a lot of fans. Many students came and asked what they should do. We tried Gnome Shell (it's much better than Unity) but it could not nearly compare to Gnome 2.x!\nIf you go your way with Unity in future you will only help Microsoft and loose the leadership in Linux distros. Please give us Gnome 2.x back - as soon as possible!\nMichael\n\nA: It is quite simply not true that anyone has forced you to upgrade to Unity. You can still use the old shell if you don't like the new one, as these screenshots prove. Nobody has even forced you to upgrade Ubuntu, with 10.04 being supported for another full year after the next LTS is released in April. It is much better to ask questions. \nAnyway, this is how my Ubuntu 11.10 desktop looked after spending two minutes customizing it. As you can see, it is the old desktop. \n\n\n", "Q: Why is there no laptop certified under 64-bit? Ubuntu has a hardware certification program (http://www.ubuntu.com/certification).\nIf you search under Release 11.10 and laptop, you will find that all are certified under 32-bit and none under 64-bit. In Release 11.04 there are only two out of 107 laptops 64-bit certified.\nWhy is that the case? And: if a laptop is only 32-bit certified, are there chances it will fail under the 64-bit release?\n\nA: By default all client systems are certified for 32-bit, unless the vendor specifically requests 64-bit certification. Servers, though, are only certified in 64-bit.\nThis reflects the fact that the recommended (i.e. the default you get when you go to download) Ubuntu version for client systems is the 32-bit one.\nThis in turn obeys a variety of factors, not all of which I'm aware of. I know, for instance, that Flash support (which prior to Oneiric and multiarch support was suboptimal on 64-bit systems) meant that recommending 64-bit and expecting a great end-user experience wasn't feasible.\nAs Ubuntu moves towards defaulting to/recommending 64-bit, expect to see certification transitioning to 64-bit instead. A capabilities survey revealed that about 80% of systems are 64-bit capable nowadays. This becomes a necessity as more systems ship with over 3 GB RAM, which is the reasonable limit for the 32-bit kernel. Also this is made possible by the fact that the end-user experience on 64-bit has improved considerably as of late.\nTwo specifics about certification: Only one arch is certified because it would be quite burdensome to certify both for all systems. Also, we have seen cases where a system would work under 32-bit Ubuntu but fail under 64-bit (and vice-versa), so don't be 100% certain that it will work (you can be highly confident, but if you want to deploy on a non-certified combo (architecture/machine) please test before you buy).\n\nA: If the laptop is certified under 32-bit, but has the ability to run 64-bit software, then chances are it'll work just fine under the 64-bit OS.\nHowever, these is the following potential issues.\n\n\n*\n\n*Precompiled binaries may not be available for 64-bit. Further, a 64-bit version on a binary may not be tested as extensively. \n\n*These binaries are likely to include- Various drivers and other software such as flash.\n\n*64-bit software in general is likely to be tested less extensively. (However, I've never run into an issue.)\n\n\nEDIT: I figured someone else would take up answering \"why\" it's like this.\nAll I can do is speculate.\n\n\n*\n\n*It's obviously more expensive to test both.\n\n*There is less demand for both testing.\n\n*The 32bit version is generally more supported overall. It's only natural that this flows over to certification as well. (ie. 32bit is labeled as \"recommended\")\nWhy does Ubuntu Download recommend 32-bit install?\n", "Q: How to execute a .sh file when the session starts?

I've downloaded the daily Ubuntu 12.04 iso.\nI currently have windows 7 x64 operating system installed.\nHow can I make a bootable usb from the Ubuntu iso?\n\nA: With UNetBootIN, for example. I like Pendrive Linux Easy USB Creator very much, but it doesn't support béta's without some tips 'n tricks. Testing an alpha isn't as simple as you think by the way, some experience is useful ;)\nDownload for Windows\n\nUnetbootin is available for Windows, Mac, Linux (Lots of distros)\n\nA: In order to make an Ubuntu live USB for installing Ubuntu in Windows, use Rufus. Rufus is the recommended application at the official Ubuntu website for making a bootable live Ubuntu USB on Windows. The USB flash drive you use should be 2GB or larger and formatted to FAT32. For Ubuntu 18.04 and later the USB flash drive should be 4GB or larger. The formatting procedure will delete all of the files that are already on the flash drive.\nThe instructions for preparing an Ubuntu live USB are found at the official Ubuntu How to create a bootable USB stick... webpage (see the step-by-step instructions below).\n\n*\n\n*Open Rufus and select your USB stick in the Device dropdown menu.\n\n\n\n\n*Click the CD-ROM icon next to the FreeDOS dropdown menu, then find your downloaded Ubuntu ISO and click Open and then Start.\n\n\n\n\n*Click Yes when it asks to download Syslinux software.\n\n\n\n\n*Click OK to write in ISO Image mode.\n\n\n\n\n*Confirm that your USB stick is selected and then click OK to continue. It is very important to verify that the device that you are installing the Ubuntu live USB to is indeed your flash drive, so that you don't overwrite any of your system or personal files which may make your operating system unbootable.\n\n\n\n\n*When it is finished, just restart your computer and start using Ubuntu, or you can install Ubuntu.\n\n\nThe Ubuntu live USB flash drive that you make this way will be bootable from a PC. In order to enable your computer to boot from the USB flash drive, you must enter your BIOS menu by pressing one of these keys: Delete, F2 or F10 as soon as the motherboard splash screen appears when the computer is booting. In the BIOS menu, you need to change the boot order so that the USB flash drive, which is usually called USB-HDD in newer computers, is the first entry in the boot sequence, and then save your new BIOS settings and exit the BIOS setup.\n\nA: you can use universal usb installer\ngo to http://www.softpedia.com/progDownload/Universal-USB-Installer-Download-186578.html\ninstall it \nand then run it and select your linux version\nand pendrive which is to be make as statup disk\n\n\n\nA: Open Unetbootin ...select daily_live ...that surely will boot.\n\nA: Ubuntu ISOs (since 11.10) are hybrid, they are both CD and USB bootable.\nOn Linux, you can just cat them to a flash drive. \nOn windows, follow the instructions here: http://www.ubuntu.com/download/ubuntu/download\nWindows 7\nRight-click on an ISO image and choose 'Open with > Windows Disc Image Burner'.\n\nSelect a disk burner (drive) and choose 'Burn'. If you check 'Verify disc after burning', it will confirm that the ISO image has been burned correctly.\n\nWindows Vista / XP / Server\nDownload and install the appropriate version of ISO Recorder.\nInsert an unformatted DVD into your burner. (Note: You can only burn DVDs with this tool from Vista.) \n\nOpen Windows Explorer, find your ISO file, right-click and choose 'Next'.\n\nA: Try Rufus. It's free and works better than unetbootin or live usb creator. It succeeded where both have failed for me.\n\nA: I haven't seen it mentioned, but Linux Live USB Creator is far and away the best I've tried. It's quick, easy, and allows Persistent Mode with no hassle. It is Windows-only, however.\n\nA: In case you are using newer computer there is a good chance it support UEFI. \nNow I understand this is an old post, but if someone have the same problem nowadays many of this answers just won't work. So if you want to create a bootable USB from Windows with all the new technologies supported (UEFI, GPT) you should use Rufus.\n", "Q: initctl won't start jobs I am operating an Ubuntu 11.10 server and one of the PHP scripts calls a bash script for inserting jobs and starting them.\nThe script copies the job into /etc/init\nEverything is fine except that the jobs don't get started with \nsudo /sbin/initctl start my-tiny-job\n\n(I think the reason is unknown job)\nWhen I run the bash script by hand: \nphp-user$ ./bashscript.sh  \n\nthen it works!

Most of my solutions involve Windows clients and servers (either because that's what clients are familiar with, or because they use proprietary software, primarily in the financial and auto repair industries, that only runs on Windows or shutters Novell NetWare), though I have been converting several clients to Mac OS X solutions.  I do, however, live in an economically depressed area (former steel mill and heavy industry town) and many small businesses and schools can't afford to invest in the technology they really need.  I see Linux becoming a major enabler for the revitalization of my community.\nThat being said, though I've used Linux for many years, I've never really developed the proficiency needed for me to feel comfortable implementing solutions for others.  I'm working on that, and as a result, have decided to start running Ubuntu on a daily basis on the netbook I use with me when I go out on service appointments, browse the web at home, and use for minor productivity work.  When I used Fedora on a few older Toshiba laptops, I never had any performance issues that I noticed.  They were Pentium 4 machines with 1GB and 2GB of RAM, one machine (a Satellite) had an integrated/shared video chipset and the other (a higher-end Tecra) had a dedicated video chipset.  Both machines were fast, responsive, and flexible.\nNow I'm using an HP Mini 210-1076NR netbook that originally ran Windows 7 Starter Edition (and later Ultimate) with 1GB of RAM.  This machine has a cellular modem from Verizon Wireless, though I no longer need to use this since my contract has expired.  The machine is in its original condition, aside from a hard drive replacement (250GB 5400 SATA) and has 1GB of RAM.\nI'm running the latest Ubuntu release, 10.10, and Unity (which I can't stand... but that's not really relevant).  Performance seems incredibly slow.. really, really slow.  There is such a lag between launching a program and it being useable.  I constantly have the screen dimmed and the system just lock up and become unresponsive, sometimes for minutes at a time.  It seems like the hard drive is working overtime, even with the simplest of programs: text editor, Firefox or Google Chrome with one or two tabs open, Tomboy notes, etc.  I don't have much running in the background: the weather applet, Tomboy notes... at one point I did have my social networking accounts added to Gwibber but the implementation was so half-assed that I ended up removing them.  I plan on installing the older Adobe AIR version of TweetDeck, but I'm not running that at this time.\nIs there anything I can do to tune or improve performance?  The Toshiba laptops I had previously ran Fedora on have since been given to clients, and they are running the same version of Ubuntu.  Those machines, while not really new, have considerably better performance than my 1-year-old netbook.  I am willing to upgrade my RAM (the maximum is 2GB), but I'm wondering if that will really make a difference.  Surprisingly, Windows 7 Ultimate ran really fast on this same machine, even with 1GB of RAM.  Will upgrading the RAM give me the performance boost I need, or is that not the issue?  Is this machine's architecture not very suited to Ubuntu?\nI don't really know what questions to ask, or what to do, aside from upgrading the RAM.  This is just a netbook, and I don't use it for any hardware-intensive tasks, so I don't want to invest money in an SSD, but I'm willing to spend money on a RAM upgrade.  What else can I do?  Is there any performance tuning I should do?\nI want to run Ubuntu 10.10, and I want to use Unity, because that's what my clients will be using.  While I appreciate that a different desktop environment, like GNOME Classic, might give better performance, or a variant of Ubuntu like Edubuntu might be better suited to older machines, those really aren't the answers I'm looking for.\nI'd appreciate any advice, suggestions, etc.  While I'm not well versed in all the Linux terminology, I am willing to learn and research anything, as gaining this knowledge is crucial to expanding my business.\n\nA: I'd suggest you this simple tips:\n\n\n*\n\n*Upgrade the RAM, it will make a huge difference.\n\n*Use a lighter Desktop like LXDE, i even find LXDE+xcompmgr (a basic composite manager) faster than Gnome with default Metacity. Gnome is a \"hog\" in these netbooks.\n2.1 You can also use XFCE+Docky or Avant Window Manager to give your clients a more Unity-like feel without the need for it.\n\n*The swap usage is set too high by default in Ubuntu, thus making\nthese devices slower, change it to a reasonable level.\n\n*Use lighter alternatives to your casual programs, Firefox and\nChrome/Chromium are \"hogs\" use Midori or other light browser. Use Abiword instead of LibreOffice Writer or Gnumeric instead of Libreoffice Calc, etc.\n\n*If you still want to run Unity despite the lag you'll get in there,\nUnity 3D is only officially available for 11.04 (based in Gnome 2,\nwhich you can't use it was never backported to 10.10) 11.10 (based in Gnome 3 which you also can't really\nuse unless you update ALL of GNOME to ver. 3.0,also it wasn't backported to 10.10) and future releases i.e. 12.04. There is a\nPPA for 10.10 that let's you run Unity 2D the lighter version based in QT and that's all the Unity you can get in 10.10.\n\n*Since you'll be deploying Ubuntu to production Systems, you might be\nlooking at the wrong direction by giving them Unity (in it's 11.04\nand 11.10 forms) or by installing 10.10 with the daily Unity 2D.\nEnter LTS release 10.04, yes it has older software but it's far more\n\"stable\" for production systems than the non LTS releases, as you\ncan imagine living on the edge of released software isn't always the\nbest of ideas.\n3#    \n     gksudo gedit /etc/sysctl.conf\n\nSearch for vm.swappiness and change its value as desired. If vm.swappiness does not exist, add it to the end of the file like so:\n     vm.swappiness=10\n\nSave the file and reboot.\n5#\nSource.\nPlease note that this PPA contains daily builds so it might break stuff so use it at your own risk!\n     sudo add-apt-repository ppa:unity-2d-team/unity-2d-daily\n     sudo apt-get update\n     sudo apt-get install unity-2d-default-settings\n     sudo apt-get dist-upgrade\n\n\nA: i have no doubt ubuntu 10.10 is fast but with unity ..it lags with you configuration ..\n..plus if you even upgrade your ram 1 to 2 gb .. it will still lag..\nproblem is not ram.. problem is processing power requirement to run graphical unity...\nI have also got ..almost same configuration netbook that you have..\nBest alternative will be lubuntu 11.10 .. its blistering fast ..it just have different desktop envirnoment i.e lxde , User interface is dead simple and compatible with ubuntu packages.\nlxde is faster than gnome, kde ,xfce.\nSorry i forgot unity 3d is not compatible with 10.10 but you can install unity 2D as mentioned by Uri Herrira.. also use light softwares again as mentioned by Uri Herrira..\nBut still my vote is for lxde or lubuntu.It has already got light packages installed by default.. \nIn simple words unity for your netbook is ...slow +less productive + high memory eater.  \n", "Q: Why is the meta key is not working when using Emacs?

Is there a terminal command that does the same thing, for the current terminal window/screen?\nTo clarify:\nI'm not interested in ways of switching the locale of the system on the remote site - that system is administered by someone else, and I have no idea what stuff might depend on the latin-1 encoding there. What I want to do is to let this terminal window on my side switch character encoding to the above mentioned, in the same way I can do with my mouse and the menus.\n\nA: Gnome Terminal uses gconf to store settings. These can be manipulated with gconftool So, you can use:\ngconftool --set --type=string /apps/gnome-terminal/profiles/Default/encoding ISO-8859-1\n\nI've tested this on 12.04. For some reason, the menu (\"Terminal\"->\"Set Character Encoding...\") doesn't seem to get updated in real time, but the actual character encoding does correctly update.\n\nA: First edit current locales in your favourite editor\nsudo gedit /var/lib/locales/supported.d/local to something like\nen_GB.UTF-8 UTF-8\nen_US.UTF-8 UTF-8\nen_GB.ISO-8859-1 ISO-8859-1\nen_US.ISO-8859-1 ISO-8859-1\n\nThen run sudo dpkg-reconfigure locales\nThen set terminal with LANG=en_GB.ISO-8859-1\nHope that works\n\nA: I don't know how to test it, but with Konsole on Kubuntu I can do the following:\n1) Find application registered to dbus\n$ qdbus\n\nI use konsole so a simple qdbus | grep kons gives me org.kde.konsole\n2) Find current sessions in Konsole\n$ qdbus org.kde.konsole | grep Sessions\n/Sessions\n/Sessions/1\n\n$ set | grep -i sessions\nKONSOLE_DBUS_SESSION=/Sessions/1\n\n3) Find useful methods \n$ qdbus org.kde.konsole /Sessions/1 | grep -i codec\nmethod QByteArray org.kde.konsole.Session.codec()\nmethod bool org.kde.konsole.Session.setCodec(QByteArray codec)\n\n4) Check current encoding\n$ qdbus org.kde.konsole /Sessions/1 org.kde.konsole.Session.codec\nUTF-8\n\n5) Set encoding\n$ qdbus org.kde.konsole /Sessions/1 org.kde.konsole.Session.setCodec ISO-8859-1\ntrue\n\n6) Check current encoding\n$ qdbus org.kde.konsole /Sessions/1 org.kde.konsole.Session.codec\nISO-8859-1\n\nUbuntu will have a similar terminal program, but you'll have to do some puzzling yourself with correct servicename, path, method and arguments.\n\nA: On xterm, change the encoding by using control sequences. For instance, within bash you get the UTF-8 character set by running:\necho -n $'\\e%G'\n\nThe ISO 8859-1 coding is accessible by running:\necho -n $'\\e%@'\n\n\nA: You are looking for luit which is designed for this purpose:\n$ luit -encoding ISO-8859-1 ssh remote.host\nIt will convert the output of the ssh command to UTF-8 so you don’t need to change the encoding of the terminal.\n\nA: Here is another solution I used to change the profile (for background color) when connecting to a production server. It involves xdotool.\nxdotool will simulate the keystrokes needed to select the desired menu item. Try it with your keyboard first, then write down the sequence :\n$ xdotool key alt+t Down c Down Return\n\nIt will activate the first character encoding. Add more Down keys before the Return to select other.\nNote: for ssh, you also can use a ~/.ssh/config file to configure aliases to your servers.\n", "Q: Cannot use both headphone ports on Dell XPS L502X at the same time I am having a problem in Ubuntu 11.10 using both of the headphone ports on my Dell.\nThis may or may not apply to other computers as well.\nBasically, there is a normal headphone jack next to an S/PDIF jack next to a mic jack.\nUnfortunately, I am unable to use both headphone jacks simultaneously, as is possible when running Windows.\nHow can Ubuntu be reconfigured so as to use both headphone jacks?\n\nA: Try this link.\nIts a link to an ubuntu forums post giving the solution to a similar problem.\nEDIT:\nThough I would recommend going through the links to solve the problem but as the person below asked me to put the instructions in the post itself, so here we go:\nFind your sound card model using this:\ncat /proc/asound/card0/codec#* | grep Codec\n\nFor me this outputs:\nCodec: IDT 92HD73C1X5\n\nThe file /usr/share/doc/alsa-base/driver/HD-Audio-Models.txt.gz lists the sound card models with available modprobe modules to use.\nzless /usr/share/doc/alsa-base/driver/HD-Audio-Models.txt.gz\n\nThe full model number wasn't in there, because the model has been wildcarded.

Windows won't have access to the hardware to monitor or help change temperatures.\n", "Q: How to I will add jpg or gif or png (logo or emblem) in Terminal \nPossible Duplicate:\nIs it possible to get the tux logo on the text based boot? \n\nI want to add jpg logo  in Terminal..but not ascii format\n\nA: Right-click -> Profile -> Profile Preferences -> Background:\n\nUPDATE:\nApparently the question is about how to add a greeting message to the Terminal:\nUsually this is done by adding a message to /etc/issue, /etc/banner or /etc/motd, depending on what conditions you want the message to be displayed.\n/etc/bash.bashrc might work as well:\necho \"  I'M THE GREAT CORNHOLIO!!!  \"\necho \"       ________________       \"\necho \"      /                \\      \"\necho \"     / /          \\ \\   \\     \"\necho \"     |                  |     \"\necho \"    /                  /      \"\necho \"   |      ___\\ \\| | / /       \"\necho \"   |      /           |       \"\necho \"   |      |     __    |       \"\necho \"  /       |       \\   |       \"\necho \"  |       |        \\  |       \"\necho \"  |       |       __  |       \"\necho \"  |      __\\     (_o) |       \"\necho \"  |     |             |       \"\necho \"   \\    ||             \\      \"\necho \"    |   |__             \\     \"\necho \"    |   |           (*___\\    \"\necho \"    |   |       _     |       \"\necho \"    |   |    //_______|       \"\necho \"    |  /       |_|_|_|___/\\   \"\necho \"     \\|       \\ -         |   \"\necho \"      |       _----_______/   \"\necho \"      |      /                \"\necho \"      |_____/                 \"\n\n", "Q: How to install using btrfs in RAID10 mode? As a test I want to install Ubuntu 11.10 onto a btrfs file system in raid10 mode.\nHowever, I have no clue on how I should go about that.\nI have tried the installer, and then creating the fs in the terminal.

Leave all partitions untouched.\nThis installs the system, however, installing the bootloader fails...\n\nA: I have spent a couple of hours in trying to install Ubuntu 12.04 Beta 2 Server on a RAID-1 btrfs system. The answer of balchmar has helped me a lot, thanks! However, I ended up using a slightly different approach and wanna mention it here for completeness:\n\n\n*\n\n*Prepare your disk partitioning.You can use the LiveCD or -as in my case- a previously installed 12.04 Ubuntu server installation. Important: I had to learn that, contrary to what is mentioned in the btrfs wiki, I had to use partitions instead of entire devices like /dev/sda, so that grub can install into the MBR by the Ubuntu Installer. So, here's the partition I used. Note that I use two identical 500GB disks and two partitions each, one for btrfs and one for swap:\n\nDisk /dev/sda: 500.1 GB, 500107862016 bytes\n255 heads, 63 sectors/track, 60801 cylinders, total 976773168 sectors\n\nUnits = sectors of 1 * 512 = 512 bytes\nSector size (logical/physical): 512 bytes / 512 bytes\nI/O size (minimum/optimal): 512 bytes / 512 bytes\nDisk identifier: 0x0004f49a\n\n   Device Boot      Start         End      Blocks   Id  System\n/dev/sda1   *        2048   945508351   472753152   83  Linux\n/dev/sda2       945508352   976771071    15631360   82  Linux swap / Solaris\n\nDisk /dev/sdb: 500.1 GB, 500107862016 bytes\n255 heads, 63 sectors/track, 60801 cylinders, total 976773168 sectors\nUnits = sectors of 1 * 512 = 512 bytes\nSector size (logical/physical): 512 bytes / 512 bytes\nI/O size (minimum/optimal): 512 bytes / 512 bytes\nDisk identifier: 0x0002505f\n\n   Device Boot      Start         End      Blocks   Id  System\n/dev/sdb1            2048   945508351   472753152   83  Linux\n/dev/sdb2       945508352   976771071    15631360   82  Linux swap / Solaris\n\n\n\n*Start a default Ubuntu 12.04 Server installation until the disk partition part. Don't make any selection there yet.\n\n*Press CTRL-ALT-F2 and enter the console. Issue the following commands, which will create a RAID-1 btrfs filesystem over /dev/sda1 and /dev/sdb1, labeling it RAID1:\n\nmake.btrfs -L RAID1 -m raid1 -d raid1 /dev/sda1 /dev/sdb1 && btrfs device scan\n\n\n*Press CTRL-ALT-F1 to go back to the installer and choose to manually partition your disk.\n\n*You can now choose /dev/sda1 and define the mount point '/'. Important: Do not choose to format the file system as this would delete your previously created RAID-1 one! (you may now also choose to make use of the previously defined swap devices, of course.)\n\n*Continue the installation as normal. All data will be now installed on your RAID-1 btrfs!\n\n*Not sure this is needed, but some people mention one has to run\n\nbtrfs filesystem balance\n\nafter the initial boot. You can check the result by issuing the following command:\n\n$ sudo btrfs filesystem show\n\nLabel: 'RAID1'  uuid: 49d2eaed-d598-462f-a768-e6e0d43dc7ce\n       Total devices 2 FS bytes used 635.45MB\n       devid    1 size 450.85GB used 1.26GB path /dev/sda1\n       devid    2 size 450.85GB used 1.26GB path /dev/sdb1\n\nBtrfs Btrfs v0.19\n\nTo see that RAID-1 is actually used for data and metadata, issue\n\n$ sudo btrfs filesystem df /\n\nData, RAID1: total=1.00GB, used=568.07MB\nSystem, RAID1: total=8.00MB, used=4.00KB\nSystem: total=4.00MB, used=0.00\nMetadata, RAID1: total=256.00MB, used=67.37MB\n\n\nA: OK, part of my problem was that I wanted to install Ubuntu Server.\nI have finally succeeded. To install Ubuntu Server on btrfs RAID10, use the following steps:\n\n\n*\n\n*Run the livecd of Ubuntu Desktop\n\n*Use gparted to create btrfs partitions on all the disks you want to use in the btrfs RAID10 setup, be sure to leave 1 MB at the beginning of the disks for GRUB. (I leave 1 MB on all the disks, so that I could always move grub to another disk, when I replace a disk with a new/larger one.\n\n*Save the new partition table\n\n*shutdown\n\n*launch the Ubuntu server installer\n\n*at the partitioning step, break out of the installer and go to the terminal\n\n*in the terminal type the following command to create a btrfs RAID10 for data and metadata (Note use the partitions, not the disks!):\nmkfs.btrfs -m raid10 -d raid10 /dev/sda1 /dev/sdb1 /dev/sdc1 /dev/sdd1\n\n\n*IMPORTANT: execute the following command: btrfs dev scan\n\n*go back to the partition part of the installer\n\n*select any one disk and choose to use that as btrfs and mountpoint root\n\n*proceed installer as normal\n\n\nSo this works fine, however, I later found out that this does not do what I had expected.\nI have 16-G, 500G and 2x 750G hard disks. \nI expected to be able to use 910G. However, raid is a bit different in btrfs I got 320G. What I wanted to use is raid1, because this will create 2 copies of each data block, even if you add 4 disks (unlike the normal raid1). So now, using raid1 in btrfs I do get the 910G.\n", "Q: Missing users after clean install and separate home partition I had three users, One Admin and two standard, in a separate /home partition running 10.04.  \nI did a clean install of 11.10 by checking the format / and /swap boxes in the partition section of the install program.  The program then asked for an Admin name and I gave it the same user name and password as the Admin on 10.04.  \nWhen I completed the install The Admin account was the only available user at start up.   When logging in as user I have all my previous user setting as I had in 10.04.  Yet there are no standard user!  \nI went to the terminal and listed the home directories and the standard users /home directory data is still there.   How come 11.10 does not recognize them?\n\nA: So your /home directory contains home folders for adminuser, usera and userb. These folders were created by the old system. \nDuring installation, you created a new user, adminuser, with same name as the adminuser in the old system. The new system you just installed is correctly using /home/adminuser as adminuser's home folder.\nYou can't log in as usera or userb yet because you have to create those other users in the new system, too.\nIn Settings, click on User Accounts and create new users with the same names as those home folders.\n", "Q: ATI / grlrx / Catalyst + gnome-shell = problems \nNot duplicate to\nthis nor this nor this one \n\nHello\nThere is a known bug with ATI driver (fglrx) and gnome-shell, I know. Just wondering why I can play 3D games with high graphic features using same driver (version 11.11)? also there is no problem with graphical effects of KDE and other programs using graphical environment, but there is problem with very simple effects of gnome-shell?. What is special with gnome-shell?\nNote: There are some success stories around... Nothing worked for me. I tried removing fglrx, installing the 11.11 driver downloaded from AMD, disabling tear effect in catalyst control center (with and without administrative privileges), disabling VSync in compize setting ......\nNote 2: I've installed Ubuntu 11.10 amd64 on Dell Inspiron N5010. Graphic card is ATI HD mobility radeon 5470. \n\nA: I can't be too technical about why this appens in gnome-shell, but I can propose a solution that in my case dramatically improved performance. I am using Gnome-Shell 3.2.1 and AMD Catalyst 11.12.\nOpen /etc/environment as root user by typing on a terminal:\nsudo gedit /etc/environment\n\nAdd this line at the bottom of the file:\nCLUTTER_PAINT=disable-clipped-redraws:disable-culling\n\nSave, and restart session.\nNote, this worked for me also on a Nvidia ION platform, and is known to improve graphics on Intel as well.\n\nA: You may need to adjust your vlc settings!\nMy setup:\n\n*\n\n*XFX Radeon HD 6670\n\n*Catalyst 11.12\n\n*gnome-shell 3.2.1-0ubuntu1\n\n*vlc 1.1.12-2~oneiric1\n\nSettings to change:\nYou'll need to open up your vlc preferences (Tools -> Preferences) and change some settings under a few categories.\nInterface:\n\n*\n\n*Uncheck Show systray icon\n\n*Uncheck Systray popup when minimized\nVideo:\n\n*\n\n*Uncheck Accelerated video output (Overlay)\nSave your settings, restart vlc.\nWhy change these particular settings?\nAccording to GNOME's guidelines, using systray icons in the notification area is deprecated. I also noticed a lot less screen flicker when starting up vlc with the systray options turned off.\nAfter that I still had problems, but only when first opening a video file and closing vlc with a video currently playing.\nAfter disabling accelerated video, I was expecting video playback to be worse. However, video files played better than before, more smoothly. I could especially notice it when watching full screen video.\nThere might be other applications that still trigger the driver's instabilities, but these adjustments to vlc fixed the problem for me!\nHope this helps.\n", "Q: Empathy, Google account, 2 step verification needs authorization every time I login The title says it all.\nI have enabled 2 step verification at my Google account.

I already know that I can uninstall Unity if I'm using Gnome-Shell exclusively, but I'm also wondering if it's safe to uninstall Compiz when I'm only using Gnome-Shell, since as far as I know, Gnome-Shell doesn't use Compiz. \n\nA: Removing compiz also removes the packages unity & ubuntu-desktop.\nThus you will lose the ability to log into the unity or unity-2d desktops.\nubuntu-desktop is a meta package - normally you would need this to allow a successful upgrade to ubuntu+1.  Therefore - just reinstall this package before you next upgrade to 12.04.\nOn my quick test, removing compiz did not stop me logging out and logging back into gnome-shell.  You are correct - gnome-shell does not use compiz as its compositing manager, it uses mutter.\n\nA: It depends on how much you want to remove and change.\nYes, you can remove compiz, it will take a little work to remove unity and potentially unnecessary packages.\nSee the linked question on how to remove Unity.\nUse the following to remove all compiz related packages:\nsudo apt-get purge compiz compiz-plugins-main-default libcompizconfig0\n\nIf you do not want to do all this, you can re-install and try the gnome 3 remix\nSee the UGR (Ubuntu Gnome Remix)\nhttps://launchpad.net/ubuntugnome\nhttps://wiki.ubuntu.com/UGR\nUGR Home page (check the LP and wiki page if you think this link is spam) http://ugr.teampr0xy.net/\n\nLinked Question:\n\n\n*\n\n*How can you remove Unity?\n", "Q: When I tried the Live CD, my multiple monitor setup worked. After I installed, it didn't. What gives? I just installed Ubuntu 11.10 x64, after making sure I could use my 2-monitor setup with the Live CD, but now Ubuntu cannot detect both my monitors. I've tried both of the Additional Drivers that Ubuntu offers, and neither helps. I've got a PNY GTS 250 1GB card with 2 DVI monitors hooked up, if that helps.\nHere's a screenshot of my Display Settings screen: http://i.imgur.com/aWCFI.png\nAny ideas on how to get it working like I did with the Live CD? Or why it was working from the Live CD but won't work now that I've installed?\n\nA: On the LiveCD you were using the free Nouveau driver. Generally worse performance but you do get KMS and xrandr works.\nBut now, you're probably on the closed source driver which does offer better performance (especially in 3d) and better power settings and scaling. All you need to do is run nvidia-settings (there's probably an entry in the dash) and edit your settings from within there.\nIf it's not installed, just search for it in the Software Center.\n", "Q: Problem starting apache Before the question let me give some background info:\nI have Ubuntu karmic installed on top of android on my asus transformer.

Ubuntu's stock kernels don't have this turned on but you're unlikely to need it with those because the packages give you the config file anyway.\nThe solution: use the stock Ubuntu kernel (it's really quite good and has pretty much everything compiled in that you're ever likely to need) - or rebuild your custom kernel with this turned on.\n\nA: FYI I fixed this by adding the line\nAcceptMutex fcntl\n\nto the bottom of apache2.conf\n\nA: I met the same error on Android with a chroot ubuntu distribution.\nI just change the following apache option (apache2.conf):\nAcceptMutex flock\nAnd it works for me.

This is very difficult with a standard Ubuntu install since things like ctrl+c seem to be set in stone whereas to mimic OS X behavior, it would need to be cmd+c. Anyway, I'm less interested in discussing the why and more interested in discussing the how.

I am, however, completely ignorant about where to begin with something like this.\nWhen the keystrokes are intercepted and processed, it should be able to send them back to the OS following the same interface that the strokes were originally sent with.

I'm stuck on a really old computer with ~500MB RAM and a 6GB HDD.  It has Windows 2000. Being not from this side of the century (it originally ran Windows 98), the BIOS does not have an option to boot from USB.  It also does not have a CD burner, and I don't have any money to order a liveCD off the internet.\nSo I only have a USB port and a floppy drive to work with.   When I tried DSL, I had a floppy that contained the kernel and syslinux.  I realize that the Ubuntu kernel is too large to fit on one 1.44MB floppy, but is there some sort of program/boot loader that could load from USB from a floppy?\n\n\n*\n\n*Yes, I tried Plop.  It didn't work because of my old BIOS.\n\n\nIs there a program that I can use to boot Ubuntu from a floppy and a USB?\nalso:  I only have a power user account.  So a lot of things go straight out the window there.\n\nA: First, as you can imagine, Ubuntu is going to run slowly on that hardware, and I normally think of a 5 Gb partition as the minimal space for an Ubuntu install.\nYou may have better success with Lubuntu, it will use less resources.\nYou can probably boot an iso from your hard drive with grub4dos\nI can not give you a detailed walk through on this as I do not have windows 98 to confirm this on, but the following should work.\nDownload ubuntu or lubuntu iso, put it in C:\\\nDownload grub4dos from http://sourceforge.net/projects/grub4dos/\nIt is a zip file, unzip it.\ncopy grldr from the extracted archive to C:\\grldr\nSave a backup copy of c:\\boot.ini , open c:\\boot.ini with notepad and add the following line to the end of the file\nc:\\grldr=\"Boot Ubuntu ISO\"\n\nSave the file and close it.\nAgain using notepad, create a file C:\\menu.lst save it as a txet file to C:\\menu.lst (that is a small \"l\" and not the number \"1\").\ntitle Ubuntu 10.04 Desktop\nfind --set-root /ubuntu-10.04-desktop-i386.iso\nmap /ubuntu-10.04-desktop-i386.iso (hd32)\nmap --hook\nroot (hd32)\nkernel /casper/vmlinuz file=/cdrom/preseed/ubuntu.seed boot=casper iso-scan/filename=/ubuntu-10.04-desktop-i386.iso quiet splash --\ninitrd /casper/initrd.lz\n\nThat menu entry is for the ubuntu-10.04-desktop-i386.iso , adjust your menu accordingly.\nReboot and give it a try. If it goes well you should boot the ubuntu iso, it will be slow.\nTo un-do those changes, delete C:\\grldr , undo your edit to c:\\boot.ini, delete C:\\menu.lst, delete the ubuntu desktop iso.\n\nA: I think this can be done with Super Grub disk to (possibly) bootstrap the USB to boot. Download the lastest iso^ from the download page.\nIf you need a program to extract the files from the iso, Peazip (or 7zip) is a free and open source tool you can use.

I was using GNOME Shell but switched back to Unity due to the amount of screen space I lost using shell.  One thing I miss from Shell is the workspace switcher it uses compared to Unity's and IMO, it is better done in Shell.  Is there a way to implement that in Unity at all?\n\nA: Problem:\nUnfortunately not yet. There has been some talk about dynamic workspaces in Unity, but I don't know of any concrete plans for this as yet.\nPartial solution:\nWhile dynamic workspaces is not yet a feature of Unity, you can get a similar feature pretty easily. This solution uses a script that was posted on Webupd8, so I cannot take the credit for the actual script and .desktop file, but the Keyboard Shortcut method is mine.\nFirst create a script (text) file with this content:\n#!/bin/bash\n\ncase $1 in \nrows)t=v;;\ncols)t=h;;\nesac;\n\ncheck=`gconftool-2 --get /apps/compiz-1/general/screen0/options/${t}size`\n\nif [[ !

I downloaded the Alternate CD on my 40KB/s line (what a mission).  I created a bootable usb with usb-creator-gtk. this didn't work, so I opened it up and moved the files so that they could be found on boot. (usb-creator is clearly useless).  So then I finally started installing Ubuntu. This was wonderful.  Upon completion I realised I hadn't installed a desktop manager.\nSo I did apt-get install ubuntu-desktop to get lightdm and unity and whatever else makes up the desktop manager.  Then I restarted.  And.... It loaded the login screen and, just like the live cd and live usb, then decided to freeze and not respond to anything I do with the keyboard or mouse.\nIn my opinion this seems to be a clear problem with the desktop manager that is probably used on the live cd and the full install.

But my problem is that when I restart my computer I got my first monitor fine but in my TV I got a blank screen and instead of the mouse I got an X, somebody know how to fix this??? and if that have something to do with the resolution?? because I'm planing to buy another 1600x900 monitor so I'll have a triple display configuration.\n\nA: If you select the 1 desktop over multiple screens function in de catalyst control center and apply it.after a reboot you can set multiple monitors via the 'screens' dialog and there wont be a \"big screen resolution\"-error.\n\nA: The way I got it to work on my machine was to:\n\n\n*\n\n*open AMD Catalyst Control Center (Administrative)\n\n*click on Display Manager\n\n*in 'Multi-Display' tab, select Multi-display dekstop with display(s) 2\n\n*apply\n\n*reboot my machine\n\n\nAfter that:\n\n\n*\n\n*open System Settings\n\n*go to Display\n\n*uncheck 'Mirror displays'\n\n*select Launcher placement to only the first screen (on the left)\n\n*click Apply\n\n\nThis worked for me on Ubuntu 12.04 Precise Pengolin. Don't forget to set 'Tear Free' in AMDCCCE and you'll get a pretty good desktop running.\n\nA: I had similar problems with the ATI driver not letting me use the screen configuration I wanted. In the end, I found that uninstalling the proprietary driver, and using the default open source driver was much more friendly. Uninstalling isn't as easy as it ought to be, but I think the instructions here should work. I had other problems though (related to the upgrade from 11.04), so I ended up reinstalling from clean, so I'm not totally sure if/how the uninstall works.\nIn 11.04 I found that the open source driver was not good enough to enable the 3D features in VirtualBox or WMWare player, but in 11.10 even that works. Unity 3D works fine with both.\nI wouldn't say the drivers are perfect, but they work very nicely most of the time. In particular, changing the resolution settings in Display Settings sometimes has strange results (flickery screens, screens off entirely) - if you really want to know what your new settings look like, log out and in again to be sure. That's annoying, but really, how often do you want to use a different setup during a session?\n\nA: I had this problem too.

This is a \"special\" file that is really a socket; when processes open this special file and read/write to it, other processes that are connected get the results of those read/writes.\nFor example, BIND9 would be configured to log to a fifo, then your PHP script would open the fifo as well, and just do reads from it. Every time BIND9 did a write, PHP would return a read.\nSee man mkfifo, but essentially:\nmkfifo /var/log/named/log.fifo\n\nHave BIND9 log to that (remove the versions and size parameters, they won't work with a fifo), then the PHP to read and parse it is up to you, but just remember you open and read from it like any normal file.

Then, when you ssh from your machine to the server, the ssh keys will be automatically used\n", "Q: I see how to have Left Alt swapped with Left Win; Can I have Right Alt swapped with Right Win? I use an IBM Model M, so I don't actually have Win keys. In Windows, I've had right-alt set to act as the Win key, and I'd like to set that up on Ubuntu as well. I went to the Keyboard Layout Options \nand found an option for Left Alt is swapped with Left Win, but I didn't see one to do the same for the right.\nSwapping the left just doesn't work for me--Alt+Tab is particularly difficult with only Right Alt acting as Alt. Am I just missing something, or is there no way to swap Right Alt and Right Win?\n\nA: I've answered the same question here: How do I swap Left Ctrl with Left Alt on my keyboard?\nThe short answer is to create a file called ~/.Xmodmap\nIt needs to contain the following xmodmap expressions to change the key mapping and reset the modifier mapping for both keys. The file needs to contain the following:\nclear control\nclear mod1\nkeycode 37 = Alt_L Meta_L\nkeycode 64 = Control_L\nadd control = Control_L Control_R\nadd mod1 = Alt_L Meta_L\n\nNext time you login the new key mappings will be active.

When started without arguments, it runs in CONFIGMODE and shows a Configuration GUI (pygtk). When started with an argument it runs in APPMODE.\nThen I have two Bash-Scripts (configmode and appmode) to start. One starts my app with arguments, the other without. For each script I have created a .desktop file in ~/.local/share/applications with different icons.\nBut even when I start appmode.desktop the Unity launcher shows the icon from configmode.desktop.\nI also use Kupfer to launch applications. And when configmode is already running Kupfer also thinks that appmode is already running.\nTherefore I wonder how Unity and Kupfer identify which .desktop file to use?\nMy goal is to see the icon from the .desktop file which I used for startup in the Unity launcher. How can I achive this?\n\nA: Unity uses the BAMF Application Matching Framework. I don't know about Kupfer.\n\nA: I think the problem might not be in the desktop files themselves, but in any of the following:\n\n\n*\n\n*.ui file: If you're using a user interface file, you might have set the icon_name property for the main window. In such a case, I'd say that the icon in the .desktop file is not used.\n\n*pygtk code: Similarly to the .ui file case, you might have set the icon for the main window using gtk.Window.set_icon_name, gtk.Window.set_default_icon_name or similar.\nMy advice is to programmatically set the icon for the main window when the application is started using gtk.Window.set_icon_name or gtk.Window.set_default_icon_name depending on the arguments passed to the application.\n", "Q: How can I enable remote control/desktop sharing on lubuntu What do I need to do to enable desktop sharing on (lubuntu)\nI want to control it from Ubuntu 11.10, if possible to also do it from a Windows pc would be great. But not if it uses more load or might make the system unstable though.\n\nA: The right way to configure screen sharing in Lubuntu/LXDE is to install x11vnc and create an auto-start file.\n1) install x11vnc:\nsudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install x11vnc\n\n2) set password:\nbrian@localhost:~# x11vnc -storepasswd\nEnter VNC password: ********\nVerify password: ********\nWrite password to /home/brian/.vnc/passwd?

SSH is probably a lighter option, it's also more secure, but is harder to use. VNC is more user friendly, but isn't secure enough to work over the Internet.\nPS: There is also software from the http://www.nomachine.com/.\n\nA: First, update your installed packages then install openssh-server.

It's awesome.  \n", "Q: Risk involved with using PPA from old release? I have some PPA's in my update sources that don't maintain active builds for oneiric. Is it safe to continue receiving updates from these PPA's using builds for prior releases like Natty or Maverick? Thanks.\n\nA: In general installing a package from a different distribution isn't recommended as explained in the pinning how to wiki page.\nHowever, you can still try to:\n\n\n*\n\n*Fetch the source package\n\n*Generate the binary packages in your machine\n\n*Install them using dpkg -i.\n\n\nIf your sources are correctly configured this this can be done with:\n$ apt-get source --compile <source_package>\n$ dpkg -i <binary_packages>\n\nAll this is explained in the recommended alternative to pinning section in the how to. Please note, that the assumption of the how to is that you try to install packages from a new distribution in an old one, not the other way around; but I think most of the contents there is still valid to your case.\nFinally, for some particular cases, like applications that don't try to modify your system, written in an interpreted language, then probably you're safe to install the software directly from the PPA.\n", "Q: I can't get grub menu to show up during boot After trying (and failing) to install better ATI drivers in 11.10, I've somehow lost my grub menu at boot time.

I get the message \"GRUB Loading\" in the terminal, but then the place where the grub menu normally appears I get a solid blank magenta screen for a while.\nHere are the contents of /etc/default/grub\n# If you change this file, run 'update-grub' afterwards to update\n# /boot/grub/grub.cfg.\n# For full documentation of the options in this file, see:\n#   info -f grub -n 'Simple configuration'\n\nGRUB_DEFAULT=0\nGRUB_HIDDEN_TIMEOUT=0\nGRUB_HIDDEN_TIMEOUT_QUIET=true\nGRUB_TIMEOUT=10\nGRUB_DISTRIBUTOR=`lsb_release -i -s 2> /dev/null || echo Debian`\nGRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT=\"quiet splash\"\nGRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX=\" vga=798 splash\"\n\n# Uncomment to enable BadRAM filtering, modify to suit your needs\n# This works with Linux (no patch required) and with any kernel that obtains\n# the memory map information from GRUB (GNU Mach, kernel of FreeBSD ...)\n#GRUB_BADRAM=\"0x01234567,0xfefefefe,0x89abcdef,0xefefefef\"\n\n# Uncomment to disable graphical terminal (grub-pc only)\n#GRUB_TERMINAL=console\n\n# The resolution used on graphical terminal\n# note that you can use only modes which your graphic card supports via VBE\n# you can see them in real GRUB with the command `vbeinfo'\n#GRUB_GFXMODE=640x480\n\n# Uncomment if you don't want GRUB to pass \"root=UUID=xxx\" parameter to Linux\n#GRUB_DISABLE_LINUX_UUID=true\n\n# Uncomment to disable generation of recovery mode menu entries\n#GRUB_DISABLE_RECOVERY=\"true\"\n\n# Uncomment to get a beep at grub start\n#GRUB_INIT_TUNE=\"480 440 1\"\n\n\nA: I have a similar problem in Ubuntu 11.10. For me it's just a black screen with \"grub loading\".\nBut I found a workaround. I can get the menu to display by activating the console mode by uncommenting this line in /etc/default/grub :\nGRUB_TERMINAL=console\n\nGood luck!\n\nA: After changing  \nGRUB_HIDDEN_TIMEOUT=10\nGRUB_HIDDEN_TIMEOUT_QUIET=false\n\nuncomment the line \n#GRUB_GFXMODE=640x480\n\nOnce that is done, Run sudo update-grub and update the Grub. Then restart the computer and the issue will be fixed. I had it fixed. I had this issue when I was using a CRT monitor. Try it. best of Luck.\n\nA: I was having the same problem on my laptop, getting the magenta blank screen.  Here's what worked for me. I changed:\nGRUB_HIDDEN_TIMEOUT=0\nGRUB_HIDDEN_TIMEOUT_QUIET=true\n\nto:\nGRUB_HIDDEN_TIMEOUT=10\nGRUB_HIDDEN_TIMEOUT_QUIET=false\n\nAnd since I didn't have a CRT, instead I changed:\nGRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT=\"quiet splash\"\n\nto:\nGRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT=\"\"\n\nThen ran update-grub.  On restart I was then able to get the menu by holding down the Shift key.\n\nA: To show the menu only when you need it\nHold SHIFT from when you see the BIOS load screen. The GRUB menu should show up.\nTo always show it\nRun Gedit as root (gksu gedit), and open the file /etc/default/grub. There should be something like this in there:\nGRUB_HIDDEN_TIMEOUT=0\nGRUB_HIDDEN_TIMEOUT_QUIET=true\n\nChange it to this:\nGRUB_HIDDEN_TIMEOUT=10\nGRUB_HIDDEN_TIMEOUT_QUIET=false\n\nSave it, run sudo update-grub from a terminal, and reboot. The GRUB menu should show up.\n\nA: None of the above suggestions worked for me. So I tried \"commenting\" the two entries. i.e. I changed them from\nGRUB_HIDDEN_TIMEOUT=0\nGRUB_HIDDEN_TIMEOUT_QUIET=true\n\nto:\n#GRUB_HIDDEN_TIMEOUT=0\n#GRUB_HIDDEN_TIMEOUT_QUIET=true\n\nI now get the grub menu screen for 10 seconds.\nGRUB_HIDDEN_TIMEOUT controls whether or not the menu is shown. The default behavior is to hide the menu if only one operating system is present. If a user with only Ubuntu wishes to display the menu, place a # symbol at the start of this line to disable the hidden menu feature. For more information, see the Grub 2 Ubuntu help page\n\nA: None of the above works for me. After compared with the /etc/default/grub on a machine that shows GRUB, I uncommented the following:\nGRUB_TERMINAL=serial    \nGRUB_SERIAL_COMMAND=\"serial --unit=0 --speed=115200 --stop=1\"\n\nthen run sudo update-grub and reboot, the GRUB menu shows.\nOther lines are:\nGRUB_DEFAULT=0\n#GRUB_HIDDEN_TIMEOUT=0\nGRUB_HIDDEN_TIMEOUT_QUIET=true\nGRUB_TIMEOUT=2\nGRUB_DISTRIBUTOR=`lsb_release -i -s 2> /dev/null || echo Debian`\n#GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT=\"quiet splash\"\nGRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT=\"\"\nGRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX=\"\"\n\nhope this helps to you.\n\nA: All the same probs here.\nEven after commenting the HIDDEN lines and uncommenting GRUB_TERMINAL=console\nI also added GRUB_TIMEOUT_STYLE=menu to no avail.\nBut after RTFM here: \nhttps://help.ubuntu.com/community/Grub2#Boot_Display_Behavior \n(scroll to --> \"GRUB vs GRUB2\")\nit says:\n\n\n*Hold down (right) SHIFT to display the menu during boot. In certain cases, pressing the ESC key may also display the menu.\nPressing ESC once after BIOS notice (F2 in my case) did the trick for me!\n\nA: Check if you have \"legacy USB\" unchecked in the BIOS. I had it unchecked some time ago to test USB IRQs and forgot about it. Then I had no way to access the grub menu (although F2 still worked to access said BIOS).\n", "Q: 11.10 external display on ATI configuration I have attached external display to my laptop (Dell Vostro 3350 with ATI Radeon HD6470 video card) but image has bad quality: everything is blurred.\nWhere and how to configure that?\n\nA: Your ATI card is listed as supported by the close source ATI driver (Catalyst)\nTo install it run\nsudo apt-get install fglrx fglrx-amdcccle\n\nAnd reboot.\nFor additional details see\nhttp://wiki.cchtml.com/index.php/Hardware\nhttp://wiki.cchtml.com/index.php/Ubuntu_Oneiric_Installation_Guide\n\nA: It might be that your second monitor is not running at the native for your display resolution (the one which is recommended).\nTry to play with different second screen resolutions:\nPress Win (it opens unity dash or gnome-shell overview -- whatever you use) and type in the search box Displays -- it will show Display Settings.

The USB stick is 8 GB.\nMy notebook allows me to boot from USB directly, so the HDD still has a Micro$oft-style boot structure (Windows 7).\nAfter playing with the O/S a bit (and learning that my HDD has 15000 reallocated sectors) the update manager prompted me to install some updates.

The USB stick containing my Ubuntu distribution gets formatted as FAT32, and the boot loader that's being installed is not actually GRUB but SYSLINUX, as per the boot_info_script script.\nIt makes sense that grub-probe can't figure out what to do considering that grub is not involved whatsoever in the boot process.\n(This leads me to wonder why doesn't apt-get check for a grub bootloader as a dependency before attempting a kernel update?)\nI suppose the next step is to try and overwrite SYSLINUX with GRUB and try to get the stick bootable that way, then see if updates work.\nMy first stab at this led to an unbootable system - grub was loading, I could load the kernel OK but couldn't figure out what to mount as root. I had to wipe and reinstall on the flash drive to get going again.\n\nA: I see that you fixed your problem (using Windows 7... not really a solution but anyway). I found a solution. I'm posting it here, for other users that may come across the problem.\nI found how to fix this. The line that breaks the installation is:\nrun-parts: executing /etc/kernel/postinst.d/zz-update-grub 3.0.0-15-generic /boot/vmlinuz-3.0.0-15-generic\n\n(The kernel version may be different on your installation)\nEdit the problematic file to comment the line that update Grub. It's a very small file so it's not too difficult.\nNOTE: If you want to backup the file first (it's usually a wise idea), copy it in an other directory (/root is a good one, /tmp is not since it wont survive a reboot). If you make a backup in the same folder (/etc/kernel/postinst.d/), it will be call as well, and it will fail.\nEdit /etc/kernel/postinst.d/zz-update-grub to comment out line 15.\nBEFORE:\n    */postinst.d/*:|*/postinst.d/*:configure|*/postrm.d/*:|*/postrm.d/*:remove)\n        exec update-grub\n        ;;\n\nAFTER:\n    */postinst.d/*:|*/postinst.d/*:configure|*/postrm.d/*:|*/postrm.d/*:remove)\n#       exec update-grub\n        ;;\n\nRun the configuration script:\nsudo dpkg --configure -a\n\nYou should see a lot of debugging, and NOT the error line at the end.\nTo be sure, re-run the configuration. It should end immediately without any logs:\nsudo dpkg --configure -a\n\nNow, you can restore the zz-update-grub file, just in case you want to install an other kernel later and grub start to work with overlayfs.\n\nA: Did you fix your problem? I have the same error here. I don't really need to fix it, I can easily re-install the system on the USB stick, but I like the challenge :)\nThe clever way to fix this would be to instruct Grub how to understand overlayfs, but I don't know the package I have to install for this (if any). Since my USB stick is still bootable, I want to force apt-get to ignore this warning. I.E. Consider this package as installed, even if it's not completely true. Well, technically, it has been install properly, only Grub fail to update the MBR. It's not a big deal since it's booting the latest version of the kernel.\nEvery attempt takes a while because it try to configure the package but Grub fail, than it try to rollback and Grub fail again...\nI tried the following without success:\n(apt-get -f is for fixing problems)\nsudo apt-get -f install\nsudo apt-get -f --force-yes install\nsudo apt-get --force-yes install linux-image-3.0.0-15-generic\nsudo apt-get install --force-yes linux-image-3.0.0-15-generic\nsudo dpkg --force-all -i linux-image-3.0.0-15-generic\nsudo apt-mark manual linux-image-3.0.0-15-generic\n(the following command is the one that trigger the bug)\nsudo dpkg --configure -a\nsudo dpkg --configure --force-all -a\n(I think the next one need the .deb file)\nsudo dpkg --force-confmiss -i linux-image-3.0.0-15-generic\nsudo dpkg --force-confold -i linux-image-3.0.0-15-generic\nsudo dpkg --no-triggers -i linux-image-3.0.0-15-generic\n\n... and many more...\n", "Q: Does ecryptfs-setup-private use real time encryption? I'm trying to encrypt some sensitive files on my computer, and I'm trying to figure out what the best option is.  I'm considering using ecryptfs-setup-private or a True Crypt file container.  I like ecryptfs because it seems more native to Ubuntu (it's in the repository after all), and it makes sense to have Private in my home directory. \nWhat I want to know is this: if I hibernate or have a hard power off while the Private directory is mounted, can someone use a live cd or mount my hard drive on another computer and see the contents of Private, or is Private encrypted real time while I am accessing files?  \n\nA: I'll answer this question, as the author of ecryptfs-setup-private, and one of the maintainers of eCryptfs.\neCryptfs provides very strong cryptographic protection of your data \"at rest\" -- ie, when your system is powered off or hibernated.  However, you should beware that when your system is running, and your home directory is mounted, your data is protected exclusively by DAC (Discretionary Access Controls) -- ie, UNIX filesystem permissions.  By default in Ubuntu, if you're using an Encrypted Home Directory, then your $HOME directory has 700 permissions -- so no other users on the system besides you (and root) will be able to see your data while its mounted.  Now when your data is mounted, then it is safely locked away in encryption.\nAs always, you should still have a very strong LOGIN passphrase, however.  Your LOGIN passphrase is used to encrypt and decrypt a much longer and strong randomly generated mount passphrase, which is stored in $HOME/.ecryptfs/wrapped-passphrase.  If an attacker has access to $HOME/.ecryptfs/wrapped-passphrase, then they can try and decrypt that file by guessing your LOGIN passphrase.  If they do decrypt that, then they will have access to your long/random MOUNT passphrase and your data is no longer safe.  As a stronger measure of security, some paranoid users (such as myself) store their wrapped-passphrase file on secure removable media such as a USB key or an SD-card, and use a symbolic link to link it into place at $HOME/.ecryptfs/wrapped-passphrase.  This should only be attempted by expert users.\nCheers!\n\nA: I believe I answered my own question. I ran ecryptfs-setup-private, and I did a hard shut down. When I booted using the live cd, I was able to list the contents of my personal home directory using ls /media//home... and in the ~/Private directory, there was the usual link to access the files, and there was no way to make it work. The files were safe! \n", "Q: How to access a machine through VNC using SSH? We have more than 500 systems running ubuntu in our office. And sometimes after installation we forget to enable to Remote desktop. So that we was not able to control that PC remotely. Is there any way to access that machine remotely using SSH? Coz ssh was installed in that remote machine. Also if that machine was in login screen we was not able to view through vnc. I guess SSH will be a good solution. Can anyone help me? Thanks in advance.\n\nA: I'm a fan of x11vnc. It's a simple VNC server and you won't have to mess around with Gnome settings or 500 firewalls, just install x11vnc on all your computers (with puppet or whatever you're using for mass-control).\nThen from your local computer run:\nssh user@host -L 5900:localhost:5900 \"x11vnc -display :0 -noxdamage\"\n\nObviously swapping user@host for the username and hostname/IP of the remote computer.\nAnd then use a VNC client of your choice to connect to localhost:5900. The SSH command starts a vnc server on the remote computer and then tunnels back that port over SSH. You don't have to open up any ports (as long as you can already SSH).\nIf your computers have funny display settings, you might do better to leave off the -display :0 segment in the SSH command. x11vnc will then automatically try to find the right display.\nThis method is better than just running a VNC server on every machine because you're not going to slow every machine down all the time. It's also considerably less of a security risk as the SSH user is the only person who's going to see the VNC server; always-visible, always-on VNC servers are popular target hacks.\n\nA: Use SSH to get to the machine. Ask gnome not to ask, \"Are you sure?\" after enabling the remote desktop access. Then enable remote access.\ngconftool-2 -s -t bool /desktop/gnome/remote_access/prompt_enabled false\ngconftool-2 -s -t bool /desktop/gnome/remote_access/enabled true\n\nYou could create scripts for this, too, maybe /usr/local/bin/start-remote-desktop.sh.\nUse your favorite editor over vim if you like...\nsudo vim /usr/local/bin/start-remote-desktop.sh\n\nThe contents of that file:\n#!/bin/bash\ngconftool-2 -s -t bool /desktop/gnome/remote_access/prompt_enabled false\ngconftool-2 -s -t bool /desktop/gnome/remote_access/enabled true\n\nMake it executable:\nsudo chmod 0755 /usr/local/bin/start-remote-desktop.sh\n\nAdd it to your default user configuration:\nsudo sh -c 'echo \"/usr/local/bin/start-remote-desktop.sh\" >> /etc/skel/.profile' \n\nAs far as the human factor goes in maintaining 500 workstations, you would love using CloneZilla. The one CloneZilla server provides pre-configured images for the workstations which can be installed over the network. You can even multicast them so that in just a few hours, to guess, all the workstations can be imaged with a common configuration, same version, etc... There's a good tutorial on dedoimedo.com. \n\nA: I'm not sure what you're asking.  If you're comfortable administering a machine from the command line, ssh is all you need.  If you want a GUI, though...  You could install and start a standalone VNC server (tightvncserver or vnc4server) over ssh -- one that doesn't control the existing GUI session, but starts a new one, visible only through VNC.\n", "Q: What is the current state of the Ubuntu Professional certification? I've heard the Ubuntu Professional certification is no longer offered, although the course can be purchased here: http://shop.canonical.com/product_info.php?products_id=533\nIs this true? After studying the course, is there no exam or certification given any more?\n\nA: I just received a response from Canonical, and it stated that in October 2010 they discontinued the Ubuntu Professional course and it was  replaced it with a course that isn't tied to any certification.\nThey also let me know that while they are not offering any sort of certification at the moment, that they are working towards producing their own certification process that will be ready sometime after Summer 2012. \n\nA: I am going to ask the same questions and give the same suggestions as I did here\nWill this certification give you anything beyond personal satisfaction?\nBefore you start down the road of getting a certification you should find out whether or not it's actually worth anything.  The only reason that I see for you to get a certification is because someone else pays for it.\nSo start by answering the following questions:\n\n\n*\n\n*Are there Jobs requiring Ubuntu certifications?\n\n*Do they pay more then the ones without it?\n\n\nIf not then the certification might be only for personal satisfaction.\n\nA: Currently, the certification that gives the option of using Ubuntu for the test is the Linux Foundation Certified SysAdmin (LFCS) which gives the user the option of CentOS, openSUSE and Ubuntu. In the case of Ubuntu, it uses the latest LTS which is 14.04.\nThe test is very complete but you can get a bit of basic training using the EDX LFS101x: Linux Foundation Introduction to Linux Course which, for a limited time only, if you finish the course and pass the final exam, it gives a 100$ coupon for the LFCS course.\nAnother way of gaining the 100$ is in the following Ubuntu-news-team Mailing List post which mentions a 100$ bonus off the LFCS for all Ubuntu lovers:\n$100 off Linux Foundation Certification for Ubuntu Members\nhttps://lists.ubuntu.com/archives/ubuntu-news-team/2014-October/002086.html\nThis are of course focused or give the option of using Ubuntu as the base OS. Other exams like the LPIC of CompTIA+ are more general when it comes to which distro to use.\n\nA: The Certified Ubuntu Engineer (CUBE) is a professional endorsement indicating mastery of Ubuntu. You need to pass 15 microcerts to earn your CUBE qualification.\nThe program is currently in Beta stage, seeking participants for beta test.\n\nA: I really think you'd be better off getting the LPIC-1 certification. From what I heard recently on the Linux Action show, and I believe they have a good point, the only distro cert that is worth anything in enterprise at the moment is Red hat. Even then, they say LPIC is just as good.\n", "Q: How to disable strict host key checking in ssh? I would like to disable strict host key checking in ssh for Ubuntu 11.04. How to do it?\n\nA: From what it sounds like, \nNoHostAuthenticationForLocalhost yes\n\nmay be good enough, for you. AND you'd still be able to maintain that semblance of security.\n\nA: In your ~/.ssh/config (if this file doesn't exist, just create it):\nHost *\n    StrictHostKeyChecking no\n\nThis will turn it off for all hosts you connect to. You can replace the * with a hostname pattern if you only want it to apply to some hosts.\nMake sure the permissions on the file restrict access to yourself only:\nsudo chmod 400 ~/.ssh/config\n\n\nA: Rather than adding it to your ~/.ssh/config file for all Host *, it would be a safer to specify a particular host.\nYou can also pass a parameter on the command-line like this:\nssh -o StrictHostKeyChecking=no yourHardenedHost.com\n\nThis will automatically add the host key to your known_hosts file if it's not already there.\nIf there's a mismatch, it will display a big warning and not update known_hosts.  It will also disable password-based authentication to prevent MITM attacks.  Private key authentication will still automatically get through though, which you may not want.\n\nA: FYI.

You can work around this problem by adding another parameter:\nUserKnownHostsFile /dev/null\n\nThis will add all these \"newly discovered\" hosts to the trash bin.  If a host key changes, no troubles.\nI would be remiss not to mention that circumventing these warnings on hostkeys has obvious security ramifications - you should be careful that you're doing it for the right reasons & that what you're connecting to actually is what you mean to connect to and not a malicious host, since at this point you've eroded a major part of the security in ssh as a solution.\nFor example if you were to try and set this with the commandline, the full command would be: \nssh -o StrictHostKeyChecking=no -o UserKnownHostsFile=/dev/null user@host\n\nThat would be silly though - given that the working examples above for ssh config files is likely to make more sense in all cases.\n", "Q: UbuntuOne on Kubuntu \nPossible Duplicate:\nIs there an Ubuntu One client for Kubuntu? \n\nIs there support for KDE?

If your video card supports OpenGL 2.0+ then you already have OpenGL ES 2.0 support and so WebGL will work fine although I recommend video cards that support OpenGL 3.0+ since it is more close to the time that OpenGL ES 2.0 came out.\n\n*Browser that supports WebGL. For the time being, the best Desktop browsers for this are Google Chrome and Firefox. I am a Firefox users but i have to say that, up to Firefox 10, Chrome still has better support for WebGL. In renders faster. More FPS in general.\nSince Firefox 4.x and Chrome 9 you have support for WebGL. Not very good but at least it has support. This was a long time ago. Right now there is Firefox 10 and Chrome 17. Both of which have superior support for WebGL.\nYou can select the Stable, Beta or Dev version you want from Chrome here: http://dev.chromium.org/getting-involved/dev-channel\nYou can select the Beta or Dev version you want from Firefox here: https://launchpad.net/~mozillateam/+archive/firefox-next\nFor what I have seen the Radeon Xpress 200M has support for OpenGL 2.0. The chipset RC410 mentions support for OpenGL 2.0. So you should be fine there. There is also no need to add command line parameters to Chrome or Firefox. Just install the latest (Firefox 10+ or Chrome 17+) and done.\nFor the drivers I do recommend using the proprietary drivers from the Additional Drivers application. Just open Dash and type Drivers. That should show you the Additional Drivers app.\n\nA: If you have the following graphics cards, WebGL is unsupported and is disabled by default:\n\n\n*\n\n*NVIDIA GeForce FX Go5200\n\n*AMD/ATI\n\n*Intel: Mesa drivers earlier than 7.9\n\n\nIf not, then check for and install all updates.\nLaunch Chrome with google-chrome --enable-webgl --allow-file-access-from-files --ignore-gpu-blacklist\nNavigate to http://get.webgl.org/\nYou should see a rotating cube.\nI would not recommend running Chrome in this state all the time, wait for better compatability.

(When into the TD App)\n\n\n\n(from now on the next ones are optional)\n\n\n*\n\n*Accept creating the icon in Desktop\n\n\n\n\n\n*\n\n*Search for a nice image to use it as Logo and download it in the Desktop (because the other one is\nlike 10x10px (I used this one)\n\n*Right click the \"WebApp\" in Desktop, go to \"Properties\" and drag the\nicon image in top of the one in the Properties Window\n\n\n\n\n\n*\n\n*Open the \"WebApp\"\n\n*Lock it to Launcher\n\n\n\n\n\n*\n\n*Enjoy\n\n\nWell, now I'm pretty happy again with a great Twitter Linux \"Client\", It works exactly same way as it used to work in Windows.\n", "Q: Nvidia GT 540M on ASUS working on Ubuntu 11.10 optimus 100% This is a laptop ASUS K53SV-SX538V  with Nvidia Geforce GT 540M.\nI have several questions about this topic:\n1.

This can be unnecessary if the system does not automatically boot off the CD.

TLP runs on every laptop brand, but setting the battery charge thresholds is available for IBM/Lenovo ThinkPads only.\nThe best part, TLP comes with a default configuration already optimized for battery life. Install it once and you don’t have to worry about anything. TLP is a pure command line tool with automated background tasks. It does not contain a GUI.\nInstall TLP on Ubuntu 14.04\nThe same set of instruction and commands can also be used to install TLP on Ubuntu 14.04 as well as Linux Mint 13 and 17 but not LMDE.\nBefore installing TLP, make sure “laptop-mode-tools” is not installed. You must remove “laptop-mode-tools” as it conflicts with TLP. Open the Terminal and run the following command:\nsudo apt-get remove laptop-mode-tools\n\nNow run the following commands to install TLP by using its official PPA:\nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:linrunner/tlp\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get install tlp tlp-rdw\n\nPlease remember, TLP will start automatically on startup, but for the first time you must start it manually. Run the following command to start TLP manually:\nsudo tlp start\n\nThere are also some optional packages you can install to improve battery life in Linux Ubuntu with TLP. You can install the  optional packages via package management tools (Ubuntu Software Center, Synaptic, …) or terminal command. Run the following command to install the optional TLP packages:\nsudo apt-get install tlp tlp-rdw\n\nThinkPads require an additional:\nsudo apt-get install tp-smapi-dkms acpi-call-tools\n\nYou can also install smartmontools, needed to display disk drive S.M.A.R.T. data and ethtool, needed to disable wake on lan. Run the following command to install smartmontools and ethtool:\nsudo apt-get install smartmontools ethtool\n\nYou can also install TLP packages for other Linux distributions: Debian 6.0+, Arch Linux, openSUSE 11.4+, Gentoo, Fedora 16 and others.

I am setting up an Ubuntu (10.10) machine that will be used by several people. It is a shared machine in a small office. Its primary roles are hosting virtual machines with VirtualBox and serving files with Samba. \nFor Samba, several user accounts need to be set up so that various people can connect to the Samba shares from their own workstations. However, there is also an account that is dedicated to just running virtual machines, that multiple people will be using. Sometimes people try to do things with this account that require elevated privileges - this causes Gnome's \"please enter an administrative user's password\" dialog to pop up. However, this dialog requests my password - when I set up the machine, mine was the first account created, so it seems to be assuming that I am the only user granted sudo powers. \nI want to designate another user as the \"administrator of first resort,\" so to speak, and it can't be the shared-account user, because everyone has to know the password of that account, so I want its privileges strictly limited. It can't be my account, since no effing way am I telling other people my password, and I won't be present at the site often enough to enter it myself. There is, though, someone who can do this in person, so I added them to /etc/sudoers. How can I tell Ubuntu that when it needs to elevate privileges for something, it should ask for their account first?\nTo summarize: \n\n\n*\n\n*Accounts on the machine: Alice, Bob, Carol, Dave, Eliza.\n\n*When Ubuntu was installed, Alice was the first user, added during the install process.\n\n*\"Dave\" is actually an account that many people use, who can't be in /etc/sudoers because its password is public knowledge. \n\n*Bob has been set to be an \"Administrative\" account in Gnome and is appropriately entered in /etc/sudoers - Bob is the boss at this office.\n\n*When actions that need elevated privileges are attempted while logged in as Bob, Carol, Eliza, or Dave, the system should request Bob's credentials.\n\n*When actions that need elevated privileges are attempted while logged in as Alice, the system should request Alice's credentials (although Alice is sort of a buckaroo sysadmin and has a habit of using su - to do extended admin tasks).\n\n\nWhat config changes do I need to make to bring about the desired state here?\n\nA: First of all let to point out that privileged actions are allowed for a non-root user through two different mechanisms.\n\n\n*\n\n*sudo\n\n*PolicyKit\nThe first one is used when you explicitly run a command with sudo or a menu item whose command is wrapped with gksu (like Synaptic Package Manager).\nIn this case the password required is that of the invoking user, usually the user logged in.\nThe second one is used when a PolicyKit-aware application try to perform a privileged action. In such a case the application asks the PolicyKit Local Authority (through D-Bus) if the action can be executed. The Local Authority then, through an Authentication Agent, asks the active user to prove its identity. The dialog windows is like the following (unfortunately with text in italian :)\n\nYou can identify PolicyKit from the little black triangle and the label Details.\nAs you can see, if more that one user is in the admin group, you can choose from the list which user to use for authentication. \nGiven all this, both sudo and PolicyKit are much more complicated, with respect to the configurations that can be achieved: you can configure action that can be executed without password, executed only by a particular user or group, etc.\nComing to your question, when the mechanism used by the application is PolicyKit, independently from the current logged in user, the password required would be that of Bob or Alice (the only two admin user, if I understand correctly), and you can change from the list which user you want to use for authentication.\nWhen the mechanism used by the application is sudo (for admin tasks performed through GUI this is becoming less frequent), you have no immediate and simple mean to choose the user for authentication.\n\nA: Clearly, sudo would be the first choice for me in such a case. The major point appears to be that most (actual) admins don't actually use /etc/sudoers to its fullest possible extent (User_Alias, Runas_Alias, Host_Alias, Cmnd_Alias).\nMost admins end up using only some of the existing rules and adding users, or worse, simply adding users to the sudo group for which a rule usually exists on Ubuntu setups (%sudo ...). This, of course, gives the respective users free reign and the full power of the superuser account.\nGiven your comment:\n\nso I added them to /etc/sudoers\n\nI reckon you also don't use it to the extent possible.\nIn a scenario such as yours I would literally script the few actions to which Bob is to be limited. In fact this is what I did on a server that I maintain, to allow two particular users to reboot a particular KVM guest on a host. The scripts would contain a hashbang with absolute path to the interpreter (e.g. #!/bin/dash instead of #!/usr/bin/env bash) and probably run with a shell that is used elsewhere for privileged tasks (/bin/dash or /bin/sh). Those are just precautions. Other than that, I would make sure to hardcode all the absolute paths to binaries and use as few of them as possible. E.g. when using bash/dash I would prefer builtins over commands (see man bash). You can make this maintainable by assigning a variable the absolute path and referring to the program based on that variable ($VIRSH instead of /usr/bin/virsh). If you can, vet the code of any external scripts before calling them. Especially if you need to call them in a privileged context. In my case I also confine the users to a particular root directory and a particular SSH subsystem as they only connect to the machine via sshd and public key authentication. Obviously you don't need that.\nMake sure to chown root: <the-script>; chmod u=rw,a=,a+rx <the-script> to prevent anyone but root proper from tinkering with it. Also be careful with setuid and setgid bits enabled on target binaries (find can be used to spot them). Let's assume for the moment that your script resides in /usr/sbin/priv-action.\nNow edit your /etc/sudoers. noexec can be used to prevent other binaries than those explicitly allowed as well. There are actually plenty of additional settings, not just those I am describing here. So make sure to consult man sudoers.\nNow I prefer to name the users (User_Alias) in my sudoers file, but you could just as well use a Group_Alias (man sudoers) or an actual system group (e.g. %sudo):\n# The list is comma-separated: bob,alice,...\nUser_Alias      LIMITED_ADMINS=bob\n\nand then add a command alias to allow executing that particular script:\n# The list is comma-separated: /usr/sbin/priv-action,/bin/bash,...\nCmnd_Alias      PRIV_ACTION=/usr/sbin/priv-action\n\nLast but not least comes the magic line to allow bob (or rather the users listed under LIMITED_ADMINS) to execute the privileged commands via the script:\nLIMITED_ADMINS  ALL=(root) PRIV_ACTION\n\nUnlike the previous alias definitions that line requires an explanation. So let's first dig into the parts on a \"User Specification\" line mean. Here man sudoers helps:\n\nThe basic structure of a user specification is who where = (as_whom) what.\n\nExample line (found on most Ubuntu setups):\nroot    ALL=(ALL) ALL\n\nThis says that a user named root (use #0 to tie it to the UID 0) may, on all hosts, run under any user context anything but will be asked for his password (assuming default behavior). Adding the NOPASSWD tag before the last ALL would then also allow root to do the same without being asked for a password (like so: root    ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD:ALL). ALL is an intrinsic wildcard alias for the various alias types.\nBut back to Bob:\nLIMITED_ADMINS  ALL=(root) PRIV_ACTION\n\nwould allow bob and other listed members of the User_Alias LIMITED_ADMINS to run (on all hosts, that's what the ALL is for) as user root (group implied, but could be given, see man sudoers) the commands given in the Cmnd_Alias PRIV_ACTION. It gets better. Still assuming you write this script, you could allow various parameters, thereby avoiding to write multiple scripts. /etc/sudoers gladly takes shell-like wildcards to limit the possibilities of arguments allowed to be passed.\nI have consistently found that admins don't use sudoers the way it should be used, which is why I appreciated the respective \"Hack\" from the two books \"Linux Server Hacks\" and \"Linux Server Hacks Volume Two\", which got me started with a more sophisticated use of this great facility.\nYou can come up with all kinds of convoluted - which may not exactly help the security aspect - solutions for your particular case, but once you speak the basic vocabulary of /etc/sudoers you can perform quite magic feats :)\nNB: keep in mind that you can also create a new file underneath /etc/sudoers.d/ if you feel so inclined. This assumes your /etc/sudoers contains the line:\n#includedir /etc/sudoers.d\n\n\nA: There is only one super user in Unix/Linux, its name is root, but sudoers are users who can become root.\nYou should use groups:\nnewgrp admins\n\nand then assign the users to that group:\nchgrp alice admins\n\nthen add the admins group to the sudoers config file like if the group was a user.\nUpdate\nOr you could add any user to the admin group:\nchgrp alice admin\n\n", "Q: Dummy output using 82801JI (ICH10 Family) HD Audio Controller My computer at work which runs 11.10 exclusively, has been very very quiet for a few weeks now.

Your touchscreen will now work again.\n\nA: Hardware issue!\nThe problem is that the magnets both in the corners of the screen as well as the back bottom of the laptop when folded into tablet mode affect the capacitative screen.\nThe solution:\n\n\n*\n\n*Carefully pry open the screen back, no screws, just plastic catches.\n\n*Put two M2x20 screws on the outside edge of the magnets, the magnets will hold them there. This distorts the nearby magnetic field away from the screen\n\n*Your touchscreen should now become one hundred percent reliable except when folded into tablet mode. To fix that, unscrew all the screws on the bottom of the laptop, then carefully pry open the case (similarly, all plastic catches). There should be magnets both facing up (the keyboard side of the case) and down (towards the laptop base, and towards the screen when in tablet mode.) Remove the magnets facing toward the screen side entirely. Adding M2 screws here may also work but I have not tried that.\n\n*You should now have a fully functioning, 100% operational touchscreen in all folding orientations.\n", "Q: When I close my Laptop lid my external monitor turns off I saw this thread : Prevent external monitors from shutting off when laptop lid is closed?\nI entered this code (from that thread): \ngconftool-2 --type string --set /apps/gnome-power-manager/buttons/lid_ac \"nothing\"\nBut my external monitor still turns off when I close the lid.The laptop remains switched on regardless of the position of the lid. How do I get my external monitor to stay on when my laptop lid is closed? \n\nA: This is a known issue in 11.10.

My printer is not listed in HPLIP (yet).\nEdit For ipp to work, do I have to set 'Allow printing from the Internet' on the server?\nAlso, Is it possible to allow only a specific client per IP or MAC?\nSolved So easy. I forgot to check the 'Show printers shared by other systems' on the client machine. I choose the printer I was looking for and bingo! No need for the IP after all.\n\nA: ip address of the printer is going to be the same as the server it is connected to.\nifconfig\niwconfig\n\nIf it is a network printer, not connected to another computer, but directly to your LAN, either it will display on the printer menu (menus vary by printer/model) or you can get the ip address from your router.\n\nA: There's a good chance that your network printer is using DHCP to get it's IP address. If you have a router, there should be an aspect to the interface that will show you the leases that are being used on your network. A little detective work should allow you to determine what the host name of your printer is (process of elimination) along with the IP address. Your printer should also have a label with the MAC address on it which should further help you identify that IP given to your printer. I\nI inherited a printer and didn't know the IP and this is how I figured it out. I then gave the printer a static IP address and put it on a label on the front of it.\n\nA: If this is a network printer it will have its own IP address.  Depending on the printer type there will be a 'service' button that you need to press.  On HP it is the 'checkmark' button I seem to recall.  \nOther manufacturers might only allow you to check it as you switch on the printer (by pressing a combination of buttons at power up).  Best place to look is online documentation if you don't have the owner's manual. \nPress the appropriate button and the printer will print out a set of details about its own settings including the IP address etc.  \nThis will allow you to access the printer's internal web server.\n", "Q: What are the differences between the Alestic and UEC AMI images? I am going to be bringing up a lot of AWS EC2 instances, and cannot find out what the differences are between the images provided by Ubuntu UEC at:\nhttp://uec-images.ubuntu.com/releases/\nand the images provided by Alestic:\nhttp://alestic.com/\nDoes anyone know what changes Alestic do to a base Ubuntu image and/or what advantages there are to running an Alestic image on Amazon vs the UEC one?\n\nA: Short answer:\nThere is no difference.  Alestic.com simply lists the same Ubuntu AMIs as ubuntu.com, and those AMIs are published by Canonical, not by me.\nLong answer:\nI publish the web site http://Alestic.com\nI used to publish unofficial Ubuntu AMIs under the name \"alestic\", primarily in 2007-2009 (Ubuntu ).  I worked with Canonical to transfer this work to them and now Canonical has paid employees who publish official Ubuntu AMIs.  Canonical builds the AMIs for Ubuntu 10.04 LTS Hardy through the present (Ubuntu 11.10) and into the future.\nSince a lot of people came to the Alestic.com web site to find out what the latest Ubuntu AMIs were, I continue listing the ids of the Ubuntu AMIs from Caninical in the table at the top of the web site. I clearly identify which AMIs are published by \"Canonical\" (almost all of them today) but the myth that I publish all of them keeps reappearing from time to time.\nI'm looking at changes to wording and layout on the site to better communicate the truth, while continuing to provide the service of listing the AMIs.\nNote: There is one series of active Ubuntu server AMIs that I still publish under the name \"alestic\".  Canonical publishes an instance-store AMI for Ubuntu 8.04 LTS Hardy, but no EBS boot AMI.  I copy the image published by Canonical (exactly, no changes) and publish an EBS boot AMI for Ubuntu 8.04 LTS Hardy.  There are a few companies that depend on this, but it is not recommended if you are just getting started.\nNote2: I occasionally publish public AMIs for specific tasks/configurations.  For example, I have been experimenting with public AMIs for running a Git server with gitolite: http://alestic.com/alestic-git/\nNote3: I create custom AMIs for various companies, but most of these are private.\n\nA: I read both web pages and I didn't find any difference, I use bitnami amis, there are lots of them with preinstalled software(lamp, lapp, tomcat, drupal, joomla, etc), I use them because always is very painful to installing tomcat :s\n", "Q: OpenShot creates 0 byte DVD files I've created an OSP file with OpenShot, and I wanted to export it as a DVD file. As this is my very first project, I've checked some how-to-websites and blogs where it was clearly explained how I could export my project. I exactly followed the commands I found there and OpenShot said my OSP file was exported successfully. \nNevertheless, every time I tried to open the exported DVD file, it said it wasn't found. I checked the file's properties and it actually showed 0 bytes. What did I do wrong?\n\nA: Openshot requires a number of codecs to function correctly - especially when it comes to creating DVDs- typically it needs mpeg and other similar codecs.\nA codec is a program or code library that converts or translates from one format to another.  There are numerous codecs for video and sound.\nWhilst you can install these codecs manually, the easiest way is to install ubuntu-restricted-extras\nThis is a package that gathers together the more commonly known codecs and installs this onto your computer.\nnote - for some countries (notably the united states) - some of these codecs are restricted from usage by patents etc.. so you need to be aware of your country's laws etc for what codecs you can lawfully use and in what circumstances you can use them.\nTo install - look in software-center for ubuntu-restricted-extras or install from the command line:\nsudo apt-get install ubuntu-restricted-extras\n\nThere are similar named restricted-extras - you should install the appropriate named package for your desktop environment.  for Unity & Gnome-Shell use ubuntu-restricted-extras\n\nA: I endorse @fossfreedom, ubuntu-restricted-extras is THE way to get all your codecs etc delivered cleanly and simply.\nHowever, I had exactly the same symptoms with OpenShot, and already had ubuntu-restricted-extras installed :-(\nThere seems to be an issue with 0.7.4 version of MLT in Oneiric. The developers have produced 0.7.6 to address the issue.

I've been using thunderbird lately and I like the unified inbox feature, where it aggregates messages in inboxes of your e-mail accounts in one place. This is also present in, for example, iOS 5.\nBut I prefer to use evolution, and from what I've seen, it doesn't have a proper Unified inbox but in previous versions it could be simulated with search folders (see http://www.svenbit.com/2011/05/create-a-unified-inbox-folder-in-evolution/).\nIn version 3.2 I could not find a way to create these search folders. Confusingly, the included help still talks about menu items that don't exist anymore (e.g. Edit → Search Folders doesn't exist, and Message → Create Rule just sends you to the filter setup dialog). And using Search → Advanced Search to search for both read and unread messages works, but only for the account I'm viewing at the moment, so it's useless.\nI could set a filter up to flag all such emails from my inboxes as read and copy them to, say, the inbox in the \"On this computer\" pseudo-account, but it's obviously not the same, for example if I want to delete a message I just read, or if I was sent a big attachment that would get copied to my computer.\nIs there any other way to achieve what I'm trying to do?\n\nA: I run Evolution 3.2.3 -- and the menu you described as \"not existing\" is there (Edit->SeachFolders). And SearchFolders would be exactly what you want. You can check with the Online Documentation on how to create them.\n", "Q: Remove Ubuntu 11.04 partitions I used to have Ubuntu 11.04. When 11.10 came out, I've made a fresh install, so I ended up with 2 Ubuntu's and one Win7 (on 2 disks);\nI haven't realized that I could have pointed my 11.10 to the same swap the 11.04 was using, but that is besides the point, so I've ended up with 2 swap partitions each of 4Gb and 2 file systems for Ubuntu (30Gb and 40Gb). Obviously I want to remove 11.04 first because it eats up space, and second because it's obsolete for me now.\nI just want to make sure I am following the right steps here.\n1) Remove Ubuntu 11.04 from my grub loader (burg in my case); DONE.\n2) Identify the 2 partitions (swap and filesystem) for 11.04 that need to be deleted: I have identified them in Disk Utility (both are on the same disk) as follows. Being on /dev/sdb they have the lowest number sdb1 and sdb2. Since I also have sdb4 and sdb5 (swap and filesystem) I assume they are for my newest Ubuntu 11.10. Also, another hint to it beeing the 11.04 is the fact that it's not mounted.\nSo, my questions are:\na) Is it safe to delete the 2 partitions? Have I identified them correctly?\nb) Will my current numbering of sdb remain the same? Meaning that a new partition will allocate the number sdb1 again? Or is the number increasing constantly?\nThx.\n\nA: I've solved this one in the mean time.\n1) Yes, I have identified the partitions correctly.\n2) After removing the unnecessary partitions using gparted in a LiveCD (and unmounted the mounted drives), I have remade the numbering on the partitions: \nsudo fdisk /dev/sdb\n\n", "Q: How to block, deny or redirect an IP address or website domain This question popped a couple of days ago and it is: How to block, deny or redirect an IP address or domain name to another IP or web domain without the use of a router or configuring a browser. Basically using only Ubuntu to do this.\nFor example, a user uses a computer, he/she does not have access to facebook or twitter (could be a denied access forever or just between 2pm to 8pm). If the user tries to enter facebook or twitter it will be redirected to another place or just plained canceled.\nThe program would be preferable in GUI but if there isn't terminal will do.\nI have checked out for example ufw and gufw but it only works for programs and ports. The case about domain names is not there. Which would make it easier to select or deselect a domain.\n\nA: iptables is helpful if it is only a few ip / domain names.\nWith iptables you can restrict based on user, group, and/or time although to do so you need to use the OUTPUT table. So to allow root, and a group \"web\", use\n# this allows root for things such as apt-get\nsudo iptables -A OUTPUT -m owner --uid-owner root -j ACCEPT\n\n# this allows users of the group web\n# create a group, web, and add users to it to allow access\nsudo iptables -A OUTPUT -m owner --gid-owner web -j ACCEPT\n\n# These two rules allow access to port 80 and 443 over the lunch hour\nsudo iptables -A OUTPUT -o eth0 -p tcp -m multiport --dports 80,443 -m time --timestart 12:00 --timestop 13:00 -j ACCEPT\nsudo iptables -A OUTPUT -o eth0 -p tcp -m multiport --dports 80,443 -j DROP\n\nBut as your needs grow more complex, it is helpful to use proxies. For example you can use privoxy (and others) for adblock. Squid adds in filtering and more complex rules (acl or access control lists), but is likely over kill for a home user.\nYou then make the proxy transparent with iptables\n# This allows root\nsudo iptables -A OUTPUT -m owner --uid-owner root -j ACCEPT\n\n# This allows privoxy, which serves as adblock\nsudo iptables -A OUTPUT -p tcp --dport 80 -m owner --uid-owner privoxy -j ACCEPT\n\n# this blocks direct access to ports 80 to all other users\nsudo iptables -A OUTPUT -p tcp --dport 80 -j DROP\n\n# This allows squid to access privoxy (I think squid runs as \"proxy\")\n#sudo iptables -A OUTPUT -o lo -p tcp --dport 8118 -m owner --uid-owner proxy -j ACCEPT\n\n# this rule blocks other users from direct access to privoxy\nsudo iptables -A OUTPUT -o lo -p tcp --dport 8118 -j DROP\n\n# Redirect all outgoing traffic on port 80 to squid listening on port 3128\nsudo iptables -t nat -A OUTPUT -p tcp --dport 80 -m owner ! --uid-owner privoxy -j REDIRECT --to-port 3128\n\nNow you install and configure privoxy and squid\nUbuntu server guide squid\nUbuntu wiki privoxy\nThe problem with this method is you then need to install squidguard, configure squid, etc, which would be a long post and better suited to a larger LAN.\n\nA: I found a better solution for you, moblock , it comes with a blacklist that is updated daily and a graphical configuration tool.\nTo install it run\nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:jre-phoenix/ppa\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get install moblock blockcontrol mobloquer\n\nThen run Mobloquer\nFor additional information see Moblock Home Page (sourceforge)\n\n\n\nA: You could block IP's and domain names with IPTABLES \noutgoing example :\niptables -A OUTPUT -p tcp -m string --string \"xxx.com\" --algo kmp -j DROP\n\nthen with a cron job you could block all domains you want at the specifc time you want, and later unblock them\n\nA: It may arise due to several conditions at which you may require to block or restrict any specific IP address or domain from access of your server. It’s a simple process and by following these instructions you can block the website domain in Ubuntu.\nAs we know Ubuntu is an open source command based operating system that’s why you would have to go through input chain of MASQUERADE rule and trigger below command:\niptables -I INPUT –s <desired ip address> -j DROP\n\nfor example you want to block 160.10.11.01 than type:\niptables -I Input –s <160.10.11.01> -j DROP\n\nIf you want to block entire IP addresses starting from 160…* than\niptables -I Input –s <160.0.0.0> -j DROP\n\nIf still any problem strikes then it would be better to contact any web host or expert domain registrar.  \n\nA: I have found firestarter quite a good GUI interface for managing iptables entries.\n", "Q: Is Grub installed when Ubuntu is the only OS installed? I have a simple question concerning Grub. When Ubuntu it's the only system installed on a machine, Grub doesn't appear when the computer it's turned on, my question is: When Ubuntu is the only system, Grub it's not installed on MBR?\nI has this doubt when I tried the ASPM command in Grub, to see if it could save some battery on my notebook, and the difference was only 0.4W. I don't even know if it made some effect or it's just a normal oscilation.\nThanks.\n\nA: As Ubuntu's GRUB wiki page says (from the behavior section):\n\nInitial Default\nGRUB 2 will boot straight into the default operating system if no\n  other operating system is detected. No menu will be displayed. If\n  another operating system is detected, the GRUB 2 menu will display.\n\nSo, don't worry. GRUB is there.\n\nA: By default, Grub does not show the list of installed OSes if there is only one installed. However, it still has many entries (such as safe mode and memtest).\nTo force it show the list (and prove its existence) just press and hold Shift key during the booting process (before the kernel is loaded).\n\nA: GRUB as a Boot Manager\nYou're thinking of GRUB as a boot manager, which is not wrong but is only part of its function. Boot managers are most useful when selecting between different operating systems. But in its capacity as a boot manager, GRUB also lets you:\n\n*\n\n*choose between different kernels\n\n*manually specify kernel options (like nomodeset)\n\n*run memtest (the RAM test utility) -- technically this is booting into another OS\n\n*implement password-protected boot\n\n*perform basic diagnostic and recovery operations -- though we usually just boot from a live CD/DVD or live USB for this as it's more powerful, and often easier and less technical\n\nAs others have said, when Ubuntu is the only installed OS, most of this functionality is accessible by holding down Shift while booting.\nBut GRUB is, most importantly, a boot loader.\nBut the most important function of GRUB is as a boot loader. The functions of a boot loader and a boot manager overlap somewhat, and the terms are sometimes used interchangeably. But the difference is:\n\n*\n\n*A boot manager provides handy functionality to enhance the user's control over the boot process.\n\n*A boot loader performs the necessary actions to boot the operating system. Without a boot loader, the operating system cannot even begin to boot.\n\nEssentially all boot managers are boot loaders, but not all boot loaders are boot managers. Some boot loaders offer boot management features less extensive than GRUB. For example, the Windows boot loader lets you choose between operating systems, though in practice it's usually only used to select between different Windows operating systems.\nWhy a Boot Loader is Needed\nYour computer's BIOS or EFI firmware is responsible for accessing storage devices and loading the boot loader from the master boot record of the device being booted from.\nThe kernel image (typically) resides within an actual partition on the disk. The boot loader accesses the filesystem containing the kernel, loads the kernel into memory, performs any steps required to run the kernel1, and runs it2.\nSome boot loaders provide additional facilities, like allowing you to choose what OS or what kernel to boot or setting boot options for kernels (like the Linux kernel and most other modern kernels) that accept them. But that is all, in a sense, secondary: the main function of the boot loader is to load the kernel and start it running. Without a boot loader, your PC wouldn't boot an OS at all.\n(1) For example, for historical reasons a traditional 32- or 64-bit BIOS-based PC starts out emulating a 16-bit processor. It has to \"become\" a 32-bit (or 64-bit) machine before loading a modern kernel, which modern boot loaders facilitate.\n(2) Just after the kernel is first loaded, it behaves like a program and it make sense to talk about it \"running.\" Once the system is started up, there's no specific process in a modern OS that is \"the kernel.\" Instead, there are several separate kernel services, and what we usually think of as \"the running kernel\" is really more like a library (providing system calls to applications).\nFurther reading:\n\n*\n\n*Wikipedia: Master Boot Record\n\n*Wikipedia: Booting\n\n*OS Dev wiki: Bootloader\n\n*xv6: a simple, Unix-like teaching operating system, Appendix B: The boot loader (p.87)\n\n", "Q: How can install Aurora (Firefox) and keep updating it?

Provided you have a default setup for PulseAudio you should be able to switch between these two sinks by issuing:\npacmd set-default-sink 1 # for headphones\npacmd set-default-sink 2 # for speakers\n\nSee also this answer for changing sink output while an active stream is playing and how to disable stream device restore.\n\nA: Surrounding the port name by quotes(\"...\") worked for me. So try\npacmd set-sink-port 2 \"analog-output;output-headphones-1\"\n\n", "Q: Does Microsoft Office 2010 still have incompatibility issues with LibreOffice I know Microsoft Office 2003 and Microsoft Office 2007 have some incompatibility issues with LibreOffice. For example if I create a document in LibreOffice with doc format and try to open it in Office 2003/2007, the margin, tables and images might/will move a bit around.\nReading that Microsoft Office 2010 is \"more compatible\" are this issues resolved that when I create a doc or odt file, it will be correctly read in Office 2010.\nNote that I say THEY have incompatibility issues. For what I have seen, the correct format is the one used in LibreOffice/OpenOffice and not the other way around. It is more standardized.\nUPDATE - Would like to add that in 2 pages of Wikipedia, Microsoft Office 2010 is mentioned as having compatibility for version 1.1 of the ODF.\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenDocument\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Office_2010\nBecause of this, I made the question just to be sure from experience of other LibreOffice users in Ubuntu.\nUPDATE 2 - The European IT authorities have come up with several ideas to improve the OOXML compatibility in LibreOffice. they include all the problems I mentioned like images, macros, frames and such. More info here and here.\nI want to also add that after LibreOffice 4.x, the compatibility level has risen. There is more compatibility between both office suite.\n\nA: With my personal experience, I say that NO they are not.\nA .doc file created in LibreOffice suffers from some changes when it is reopened in MS Office 2010. You will also feel that your header and footer settings are disturbed. \nSame in the case of .ppt files.\nI prepared a seminar of robotics in LibreOffice and saved it as a .ppt file. But, at the time of presentation my college offered me a Windows computer with MS Office 2010. When I opened the .ppt on Windows, I have to make several changes before presentation such as  page width, table size, heading size and images (specially charts and bars).\n\nA: In my experience it is completely unrealistic to suggest that in dealing with an organisation of any size that relies on Microsoft products, anyone can survive by using LibreOffice. I work in a university (in theory, more open to experimentation, difference and tolerance than, say, businesses). Our admin constantly bombards us with documents containing complex tables, forms, formating etc. Very soon I realised that opening, modifying or creating anything like that in OpenOffice/LibreOffice is asking for trouble. You can never be sure you are seeing all the (possibly critical) information that is there, and if you fill a document in and forward it, it is almost certain someone will complain and you will have to do it again using MS Word. Line managers and colleagues do not understand the technical issues or politics involved. All they want is the job done and an easy life, so you are left looking weird. \nI have LibreOffice on my netbook and I must say I cannot rely on it for self-sufficiency. On one occasion a couple of years ago I couldn't open a password-protected Word doc because OpenOffice back then didn't support passwords! The problem is I was abroad and I had to reply to a work email urgently. That's when I said never again. I had to install Microsoft Word. I nearly abandoned Ubuntu that day. I wish I could rely on LibreOffice, but I am afraid this is not possible. It may be Microsoft's fault but that makes little difference in practice. Clearly, when people don't see compatibility issues either they deal with very, very simple documents, or they are very biased.    \n\nA: I have struggled with this for years.  The fact is that you cannot use a workflow that includes passing documents back and forth between any version of Microsoft Office and Libre Office -- with the possible exception of very simple spreadsheets and word documents.\nYou either need to force your associates to move to Libre Office or conform and use MS Office yourself.  It's a huge issue for Libre Office in a world where MS Office is still the dominant player.\n\nA: On my experience, I really did not saw any bigger change on the way it show the files, still the same kind of formating problems. \non my case i used play on linux to install a MS-office 2007 in my ubuntu so i could open the pptx files in a correct manner.\n\nA: I think \"the margin, tables and images might/will move a bit around\" is way too strong definition of incompatibility. This way MS Office is not compatible with itself: you may open the same document on two different computers using the same version of MS Office and get two different results. It is less related to presentations because Power Point presentations are more like sets of objects with implicitly or explicitly given coordinates, but still even in Power Point there may appear, for example, another empty slide or some other discrepancy.\nThe reason is obvious, .doc is a \"flow of text\" that has as much information about every piece as possible but still some default settings not included in the document itself may matter. For example, at least in earlier versions the page format was not included in the .doc file, and if two computers have Office with different default page sizes, e.g. US Letter and A4, they will render the same document differently.\nTo ensure this kind of compatibility everything should be compiled to PostScript or PDF. But even pdf may look different on another computer (though, those are mostly font-related issues when fonts are not embedded into the document). Luckily, the Acrobat Reader is available on every computer and even allows to show presentations full-screen etc.\nSince you asked about own experience: for me the real issue is when one program cannot open the document created in the other one, and I believe (and from my own little experience -- little because I prefer TeX) by now they are 99%-compatible. Except for VBA and macros -- there are still a lot of issues even though LibreOffice has VBA-compatible mode. The last issue I had was when I was trying to modify a VBA macro using LibreOffice: it run the changed macro beautifully, but just did not save any changes, and did not show any errors when I was saving it... Beware.\n", "Q: Update Manager won't let me update to Ubuntu 11.10 \nPossible Duplicate:\nHow do I upgrade from 11.04 to 11.10? \n\nToday i was playing with an old netbook (Msi Wind U100) I have with Ubuntu 11.04...

Before people flag this as an exact duplicate of How can I use a .html file as desktop background/wallpaper? please let me clarify .\nUnlike that question where he just wants desktop icons for launching webapps , \nI want to use a HTML page as a background because I have a Slideshow as a HTML file which retrieves images from many sources . I want to be able to set this as a background just like in Windows XP. Is this possible ? \nI heard from someone that I can use screenlets , but I would like to avoid that if possible.\nEDIT\nIf not possible with Compiz or nautilus, what about with other display managers ? \nGnome Shell, XFCE, LDXE etc ? \n\nA: You cannot do this with Nautilus or Compiz, no. I don't know what exactly the screenlets you are talking about are, but the general answer is no. File managers and the window manager, do not use a webkit view to draw the background and icons. This works in Windows, because the file manager and web browser, are the same thing. In Ubuntu, they aren't.\n\nA: I know that this is an old question...but I just made this (BackgroundPage):\n\n\n*\n\n*http://ciaccodavi.de/BackgroundPage/\n\n*or https://github.com/CiaccoDavide/BackgroundPage/tree/master/docs\nI tried it on Debian and Lubuntu and it works, but I couldn't build a release for Linux...\nYou can try using the source code in Qt\n", "Q: Printer jobs can not be stopped Recently I had one of the most frustrating experiences with my printer.\nI sent a some print jobs to my Canon Pixus iP3100 printer, but then realized there was a problem with the layout, and so I wanted to kill the print jobs. I went to this interface:\n\nHowever, pressing the stop button, marked with the square, did nothing.\nI tried everything I could think of to kill the print jobs. I tried restarting the printer. I rebooted the computer. I hit \"reset\" on the printer. I tried killing any printer related tasks in the task manager.\nNo matter what I did, though, the same jobs were in the queue, and the only way in the end that I was able to get past them was to have them all run through to the end.\nIs this a bug, or is there some other aspect to this that I am missing?\n\nA: Open the terminal and type lprm.\nThis will clear the print queue and thus stop the printing.\n\nA: \"lpq -a\" will show you jobs on all printers (without the -a it will only show jobs on the default printer).\nThe third field of the output will be the job number, which you can use with \"lprm\" to cancel a specific job.\nHere's an example.  PDF is my default printer, but not the one I sent my jobs to:\n\n[$] lpq\n  PDF is ready no entries\n[$] lpq -a\n  Rank    Owner   Job     File(s)\n  Total Size active  (null)  151     untitled\n  1853440 bytes 1st     (null)  153     untitled\n  100352 bytes\n[$] lprm 153\n[$] lpq -a\n  Rank    Owner   Job     File(s)\n  Total Size active  (null)  151     untitled\n  1853440 bytes\n\n\nA: lprm did not work for me - there must be something strange about my Ubuntu install.\nHowever, typing cancel -a in a terminal worked fine.\n\nA: What happens if you hit that \"Lock\" button on the upper right, so you can unlock it?  I don't know - my printer controls are different - but I'm guessing that might give you access so you can kill jobs.\n", "Q: Ubuntu 10.10 trash CPU overload I have a weird bug with Ubuntu 10.10 on one of my computer. When I empty the trash, the process - gvfsd-trash goes to 200% and does not stop until I kill it (using kill -9).\nDoes not matter if I have a 1 file or 100.\nWhat can be the issue?\nHere's a screenshot of mine (it's not 200% but it's 98%) which i think it's not normal.\n\n\nA: I had the same issue and I created an applet. This way i simply did rm -rf the trash folder. I also added a \"shred\" option - which is configurable.\nthis way more secure.\nhere's a example of applet code: http://conjurecode.com/create-indicator-applet-for-ubuntu-unity-with-python/\n\nA: Try what is on this e-how page: http://www.ehow.com/how_8219428_empty-trash-can-through-terminal.html, then let me know if it emptied this way.

I have a file /dev/ttyS0. And every time I boot, its file permissions are changed to default (unwritable) by the system. So, I have to run a chmod command every time I boot-up. How can I change its file permission permanently?\n\nA: Changing the file permission is not a good idea. I think /dev/ttyS* are designed to be accessed by user space applications, so you dont need to make it accessible to everybody. Instead you should give permission to use the serial ports to users that need access. If I am not wrong, you can do this by adding your user to the group uucp which can be done by running the following command in the terminal: \nusermod -aG uucp <you_user_name> \n\nIf this does not solve your issue, try posting a bit more details on what you are doing.

I want to run some applications with command line options (for example, someapp --option=3), and I want to do this by opening the dash, typing the application name and clicking on the appropriate icon.\nI assume that I could do this from the launcher (run the application, tick \"Keep in launcher\" and then tweak the .desktop file), but I don't want to have to add icons to the launcher.\nSo, how do I add an icon for someapp --option=3 to the dash / app lens?\nI don't mind somehow adding an extra icon for someapp --option=3, and seeing both icons when I type someapp into the dash. However, it would be ideal if I could choose to remove/replace the someapp icon - in most cases I only ever want to run the app with the option applied. It would be even more ideal if additionally I could add multiple icons, one for someapp --option=3 and another for someapp --option=4 - in a few cases I want to choose between different mode.\n\nA: The apps shown in the dash are .desktop files from /usr/share/applications (system wide) and ~/.local/share/applications (one user only).\n\nIf you want to modify an existing icon you will need to edit it's .desktop file in those locations. You will need root privileges to be able to modify the system wide icon (/usr/share/applications).\nIf you want to add a new icon, you will need to make a new .desktop file in either location.

No problem for .odt format of course.\nDoes anyone know why this happens? Thanks in advanced.\n\nA: A quick, stupid (but works!) solution is to open a hotmail account, if you don't already have one, and send the file to yourself.\nHotmail allows you to view the file online, and edit it!\nI don't want to support hotmail, GMAIL does the same think, but because Microsoft owns hotmail, it is logical that hotmail will be able to handle docx and such formats more efficiently!\n\nA: Basically what Michael K said.  Microsoft does not publish specs for their format - office suites must guess at the content of .docx files.  This is done so that Microsoft keeps the monopoly on writing suites and office products - they can say things like \"Only Office has complete compatability with .docx files\".\nAs a result of this, independent suites such as LibreOffice and OpenOffice can't keep up with the newest features completely.  There's unfortunately no way around this; LibreOffice Writer just doesn't know what to do with that part of the document.\nAs a workaround, you can use a software program called \"PlayOnLinux\" (it's in the official repositories, just open software center) to install Office in Ubuntu.  Currently it supports Excel, Powerpoint, Outlook, and Word from all versions of Office.  You just need to have the ISO or disc lying around along with a serial and the wizard will guide you through it step-by-step.\nTo install PlayOnLinux, either look in the Software Center or type sudo apt-get install playonlinux in the terminal.\n", "Q: Do not display user name in the panel In Unity the user name is shown in the panel.

I want to change the OS hostname but I do not want to restart.\nI have edited /etc/hostname but it requires a restart to get implemented. How to avoid this?\n\nA: To get your current hostname:\ncat /etc/hostname\n\nThis can be changed in any text editor. You would also need to update entry other than localhost against 127.0.0.1 in /etc/hosts.\n\nA: It's easy. Just click the Gear icon (located at upper right corner of the screen), open \"About this computer\" screen (located at Gear icon ) and edit \"Device name\". \nOr, in a terminal, use the following command:\nsudo hostname your-new-name\n\nThis will set the hostname to your-new-name until you restart. See man hostname and How do I change the computer name? for further information. Do not use _ in your name.\nNote\nAfter a restart your changes in /etc/hostname will be used, so (as you said in the question), you should still use\nsudo -H gedit /etc/hostname\n\n(or some other editor) so that file contains the hostname.\nTo test that the file is set up correctly, run:\nsudo service hostname start\n\nYou should also edit /etc/hosts and change the line which reads:\n127.0.1.1     your-old-hostname\n\nso that it now contains your new hostname. (This is required otherwise many commands will cease functioning.) \n\nA: Without Restart\nChanging the hostname or computer name in ubuntu without restart\nEdit /etc/hostname and change to the new value,\nnano /etc/hostname \n\nEdit /etc/hosts and change the old 127.0.1.1 line to your new hostname\n127.0.0.1   localhost\n127.0.1.1   ubuntu.local    ubuntu   # change to your new hostname/fqdn\n\nNote : i have read it on a forum > Edit /etc/hosts and change the old 127.0.1.1 line to your new hostname (if you don't do this, you wont be able to use sudo anymore. If you have already done it, press ESC on the grub menu, choose recovery, and edit your host file to the correct settings)\nNow after a reboot, your hostname will be the new one you chose\nWithout Reboot\nTo change without a reboot, you can just use hostname.sh after you edit /etc/hostname. You must keep both your host names in /etc/hosts (127.0.0.1 newhost oldhost) until you execute the command below:\nsudo service hostname start\n\nNote : Above command to make the change active. The hostname saved in this file (/etc/hostname) will be preserved on system reboot (and will be set using the same service).\n\nA: The classical answer to the original poster's question is that, once you've edited /etc/hostname, you make it apply without restart by running hostname(1) with the -F (--file) option as root:\nsudo hostname -F /etc/hostname\n\nThe hostname(5) handling with /etc/hostname and the said program has been the same in Debian and its derivatives for over twenty years now, and the package providing it has been tagged essential and required, and IIRC the init scripts have literally used the same thing for decades (/etc/init/hostname.conf still contains it), so I have to say I am genuinely puzzled how nobody had mentioned this already :)\n\nA: Ubuntu 16.04\nSolution based on answer from the DigitalOcean Comunity.\nEdit hosts file.\n$ sudo nano /etc/hosts\nReplace oldname with new one.\n127.0.0.1  localhost newname\nSetup new hostname.\n$ sudo hostnamectl set-hostname newname\n\nA: The default name was set when you were installing Ubuntu. You can easily change it to whatever you want in both Desktop & Server by editing the hosts and hostname files. Below is how:\n\n\n*\n\n*Press CtrlAltt on keyboard to open the terminal. When it opens, run the below command: sudo hostname NEW_NAME_HERE\nThis will change the hostname until next reboot. The change won’t be visible immediately in your current terminal. Start a new terminal to see the new hostname.\n\n\n*To change the name permanently, run command to edit the host files:\nsudo -H gedit /etc/hostname and sudo -H gedit /etc/hosts\nFor Ubuntu server without a GUI, run sudo vi /etc/hostname and sudo vi /etc/hosts and edit them one by one.\nIn both files, change the name to what you want and save them.\nFinally, restart your computer to apply the changes.\n\nA: *\n\n*Replace the contents of /etc/hostname with the desired hostname (you can edit with sudo nano /etc/hostname)\n\n*In /etc/hosts, replace the entry next to 127.0.1.1 with the desired hostname (you can edit with sudo nano /etc/hosts)\n\n*Execute sudo service hostname restart; sudo service networking restart\n\nA: Ubuntu 16.04\nThis is without restart and without any terminal use.\n\n\n*\n\n*Go to System Settings -> Details.\n\n*There it is. Beside Device name, there is a text-box.\n\n*Edit text-box and close window.\n\n\nOpen terminal. See for yourselves.\n(For older versions, the text-box is not editable.)\n\nA: Ubuntu 13.04 onwards\nThe hostnamectl command is part of the default installation on both Desktop and Server editions.\nIt combines setting the hostname via the hostname command and editing /etc/hostname. As well as setting the static hostname, it can set the \"pretty\" hostname, which is not used in Ubuntu. Unfortunately, editing /etc/hosts still has to be done separately.\nhostnamectl set-hostname new-hostname\n\nThis command is part of the systemd-services package (which, as of Ubuntu 14.04, also includes the timedatectl and localectl commands). As Ubuntu migrates to systemd, this tool is the future.\n\nA: sudo hostname your-new-name\nsudo /etc/init.d/networking restart\n\nThat should do the job I think\n\nA: I have read the answers, But I think Probably you are looking for this:\nJust execute these two commands after editing the /etc/hostname file.\n$ sudo service hostname restart\n$ exec bash\n\nThat's all. No need to restart.Also make sure you also change the name in /etc/hosts file.\n\nA: Cloud-init (Ubuntu 18+) hostname persistence\nWhilst the above approaches (hostnamectl, etc/hostname, etc) work for immediate hostname change, with the advent of cloud-init - which can control setting of the hostname - amongst many other things.

About a year ago I've read that Ubuntu is considering to become a rolling distro. Since then I couldn't found any fresher news about the topic.\nAnyone has official information about the transition?\n\nA: Those rumors where unfounded, Ubuntu's plans to become a rolling distro never saw the light of day even if they were ever discussed internally.\nThat news that you saw back in 2010 triggered a response from Engineering Director of Ubuntu Rick Spencer.\nOn his blog post he clearly says\n\n\"Ubuntu is not changing to a rolling release\".\n\nHe goes further down saying\n\n\"What the article was probably referring to was the possibility of making it easier for developers to use cutting edge versions of certain software packages on Ubuntu.This is a wide-ranging project that we will continue to pursue through our normal planning processes.\"\n\nWhat he refers here is the +1 maintenance team which exist to ease the pressure on developers and make further releases easier and less stressful for them. It is not to be confused with a rolling release.\nAfter that there was not further information or news about Ubuntu becoming a rolling release.\nI am assuming that this can be answered better by someone from Canonical / Ubuntu. But since those rumors where proven false and there is no further information about this I can assume that a rolling release is not on the planning table.\n", "Q: How do I  start jobs as a non privileged user in Upstart? I'm using last upstart version for ubuntu 10.4 LTS. upstart is launched with --debug kernel flag.\nI'm making a custom job configuration for nzbget daemon. Basically, this job has a pre-start script that mounts a filesystem, a post-start script that unmounts the filesystem and an exec nzbget -D line.\nThe problem is that the nzbget daemon needs to run as a non privilleged user. This feature is already included in nzbget. Indeed, when I run from console sudo nzbget -D the process runs as a non privileged user. But when I start the upstart job with the exec nzbget -D line, the process nzbget -D runs as root. As said in the upstart cookbook, I tried to use su -c \"nzbget -D\" user and also start-stop-daemon both without the expect stanza as adviced. But for both commands, as upstart tracks the wrong PID I guess, it sees the main process as killed (owing to upstart logs) at the end of start process and thus, it launches the post-process script which I don't want.\n=> How can I do it right? How is it that exec nzbget -D upstart command makes the process run as root whereas sudo nzbget -D command makes it run as non privilleged user?\n\nA: I suggest using sudo with the following syntax:\nsudo -u foouser foocommand\n\nthis runs the command foocommand as user foouser.\n\nA: There was some progress with the release of version 1.4.:\n\nNew “setuid” and “setgid” stanzas to allow system jobs to be run under the specified uid/gid corresponding to the given name/group.\n\nYou can grab it from their LaunchPad page but (strangely) I can't see a PPA so you might have to compile it yourself.\nOtherwise, use su or sudo in your exec command like so:\nsu -c \"<commands>\" <username>\nsudo -u <username> <commands>\n\nThey both do pretty much the same thing so pick whichever you're happiest with. So using your example command:\nexec sudo -u me \"nzbget -D\"\n\n", "Q: create link to folder thats useable with ftp I created some links to folders in my home dir so i don't have to go down the long path all the time, i used 'ln -s' for this.\nI can use them when i log in via ssh but when use ftp it just shows the link as a file and not like a shortcut as intended.\nI tried to use just 'ln' but that doesn't seem to work with folders, and using the -d is not permitted.\nIs there a way to this so i can also it in an ftp program?\n\nA: For ssh and ftp there are different security concepts. SSH uses the permissions of the user logged in. Thus via SSH a remote user can access all files the user can access locally on the machine. \nVia FTP however, the access is restricted by folder. Thus you cannot / should not leave the directory through a link, else one could create a link to a file \"whereever\" on your computer via ftp and access it.\nIf you need file transfer I encourage you to use scp instead of ftp to copy files. Its fairly easy to use and more secure! E.g. you can use filezilla ftp client also with sftp (means ssh / scp)\n", "Q: Periodic tick / click /crack sound from Logitech QuickCam Pro 5000 USB webcam While watching the input volume meter from my webcam in pavucontrol, it maxes out with a short (100ms or so) cracking sound every ~3 seconds, independently of the ambient sound.

I have Nautilus set up to mount a remote filesystem using SFTP.\nThat works fine, so far, but SFTP seems to have some issues I find unhelpful:\n\n\n*\n\n*When I overwrite an existing text file, the group read permissions are mysteriously removed on the remote machine.\n\n*When I try to attach a file to an email by dragging it to thunderbird, I get an sftp:// url which TB can't use (yet, if I open the TB attach dialogue and browse though .gvfs, all is well).\n\n\nNone of this happens when I manually mount the same filesystem through SSHFS. Is it possible to configure Nautilus to use SSHFS? A plugin maybe? It doesn't appear on the \"Connect to Server\" list of available options.\nEDIT: It's been pointed out that sshfs uses the sftp protocol as a backend. While that maybe true, the real problem is that accessing files via Nautilus is less smooth than mounting via sshfs, and I'd like to figure out how to get Nautilus to do it the nice way.\n\nA: From Wikibook OpenSSH\n\nAnother way to transfer files back and forth, or even use them remotely, is to use sshfs It is a file system client based on SFTP and utilizes the sftp-subsystem. It can make a directory on the remote server accessible as a directory on the local file system which can be accessed by any program just as if it were a local directory. The user must have read-write privileges for mount point to use sshfs.\n\nSo finally it is both the same way of communication. SSHFS uses SFTP. The difference is that sshfs is a file system driver which allows to mount a drive which allows access via SFTP. Nautilus however does not mount drives, it only shows them. You can add your Filesystem to /etc/fstab to have it mounted at boot time, however I do not suggest that as the ssh connection might not be available. Easier would be to setup a bash script which can be ran as startup application.\nThe behaviour described in #2 is only logical: as you have connected via SFTP only, the file you drag into thunderbird does not exist in your file system, but as a remote path.\nEdit because of the comment:\nMaybe I explained it not good enough. Here an example: If your remote ressource is on server fooserver and the root directory is foodir, the file is in foosubdir/foofile, then the ressource path is sftp://fooserver/foodir/foosubdir/foofile. WHen you use Nautilus SFTP, this is still the only path for you to access this file, it is remote. If you use sshfs instead, the contents of foodir become available from within your file system - sshfs is a file system driver. Then it is as if the file were stored on your harddisk. The contents of the ressource sftp://fooserver/foodir are logically mapped into your mount directory ~/.gvfs . Then thunderbird can access this file from within your local file system context as ~/.gvfs/foosubdir/foofile . Thunderbird does not even notice that it is a remote file, the sshfs file system driver integrated into the klinux kernel does abstract that for you.\n\nA: To mount Host's remote folder so that you can treat remote files as if they were local on your Client, use sshfs instead of sftp.* You will need an OpenSSH Server on Host before the following will work.\nMount Host's remote folder on local Client\nFrom Client, run [1]:\ntest -e ~/mountpoint || mkdir --mode 700 ~/mountpoint\nsshfs fred@server.example.org:. ~/mountpoint -p <port-number>\n\nStart using Nautilus\nNow open the local folder ~/mountpoint in Nautilus. Congratulations, you can treat remote files as if they were local on your Client!\nUnmount Host's remote folder on local Client\nfusermount -u ~/mountpoint\n\n*Details: SFTP is for file transfer to and from Client and Host while SSHFS is a file system client that makes remote files behave as local. It's as if you temporarily synchronized Host's remote folder with a virtual local folder.\nAs you interact with these SSHFS files, your local Client will SSH a copy from Host to Client so things behave as if they were local on your Client. Any changes you make, however, take effect upon the remote Host and remain even after you unmount.\n", "Q: Why does my Ubuntu run on low-graphic mode?

At least those applications that do not require anything special to work.\n2) What other applications/games etc. that do not require to be installed by admin do you know? (I have no idea how broad this question is.)\n3) When a Java-based application is installed by a non-admin user, does it (JavaRE) give the application access to any system files/resources etc. otherwise protected from modifying? I would think no, but at the same time Java was installed by admin, and during installation it may have granted itself access to some resources.\n\nA: deb/dkpg packages require root to be installed. This is as much to protect the machine and its other users from harm as it is to protect the software from the users. (that made sense in my head!) This is technically the case becuase the whole apt/dpkg database is owned by root.\nSidebar: These days you can install and update things without root because of a permissions framework called PolicyKit that is similar to sudo/sudoers for graphical interfaces.\nBut there's no reason you can't have a local repository in another format. Desura (a Steam-a-like) manages your game installations. Eclipse can manage its own plugins and update them. Firefox for plugins. They're all repositories in their own way.\n\nYou don't have to install most software. If you can download it, most can be extracted, compiled (if it needs it) and run. You don't have to jump through the packaging steps.\nPlenty of games come in .run installers. If you run these as root, it'll install the game into /opt/ or /usr/local/games/, etc but otherwise it'll install into your home directory.\n\nAs for your third question, no. It can only modify what the user can modify. And the same goes for a root-installed Java (or other) application. Unless it runs through a crazy setuid process, it can only access what the user can access. Just because the executable may is owned by root, doesn't mean it runs as root.\n", "Q: How to access the printer from within wine How can I have access to my printer from within Wine so I can use for example Office 2003 to print something.

My confusion was that I did not see it in the Office 2003 that I was emulating in Wine and this was because I did not have it actually connected to the laptop.\nSo If you do not see the printer in the emulated program it is most likely that it is not actually connected to PC.

Even in Windows.\nFor three monitors you either need two cards or a different brand that will support all three at once (ATI/AMD have some that do lots of screens but I'm not sure how well supported this is in Linux).\nEdit: If you're determined to stick with one Nvidia card, you can get a Matrox DualHead2Go which is a box that you plug two monitors into and then plug that box into one of the outputs on the video card. It makes the video card think that those two monitors are just one screen. The downside is it's not cheap (over £100) and it also enforces some refresh/resolution limits.\nThey also do a TripleHead2Go (three monitors into one port) and this costs twice as much. But that does mean you could have 6 monitors coming off one Nvidia card which would be pretty epic (assuming it didn't crumble into dust trying to render that much at once).\n\nA: It will only recognize the first two you plugged in. The third shows up in the display manager, greyed out. If you click to turn it on, it freezes for a while then times out. You could leave your TV plugged in all the time, then just unplug one of your monitors and click \"detect displays\" in the display manager.

I thought the GeForce GT 430 could handle more than two monitors.. otherwise I wouldn't have bought it.\n", "Q: Why Dash cant see new installed program? \nPossible Duplicate:\nHow to pin Eclipse to the Unity launcher? \n\nI installed Eclipse IDE on my Ubuntu 11.10:\n1) To install Eclipse need to download eclipse-jee-indigo-SR1-linux-gtk.tar.gz from Download page\n2) Untar downloaded archive tar zxvf eclipse-jee-indigo-SR1-linux-gtk.tar.gz\n3) Move to ~/ mv eclipse ~/eclipse.\nAfter this I opened Dash Window and in input field writed Eclipse, but - Dash found nothing...\nWhy?\nMaybe, I must add eclipse in some Dash programs list or something like this?\n\nA: The tar package from Eclipse does not include creating a launcher, you have just extracted the package, there was no installation.\nYou need to create a launcher and add it to dash for it to be available.\nThis question already has a explanation on how to do it, you just need to modify the path to the files (executable and icon) but the steps are the same.\n", "Q: Install Ubuntu on external drive without removing internal drive? (during installation) All the guides I've read on installing Ubuntu to an external drive strongly recommend unplugging the internal drive before installation. Is there a way around this? I have a Macbook Pro, and I'd really prefer not having to open and take my SSD out. \nGiven the flexibility of Linux, I would imagine there's a way to ignore the internal drive during the installation. \nAnd I'd at least be interested in the explanation why this isn't possible, if that's the case :)\n\nA: You can install Ubuntu onto an external (or internal for that matter) drive without removing the internal drive. You just need to make sure you understand how linux identifies drives and where you install grub.\nIMO most people who make such recommendations either \n\n\n*\n\n*Do not understand grub.\n\n*Make such recommendations \"just in case\".\nI do not want you to take my advice as dismissive, when installing a operating system, data loss (due to over writing your data) is a mouse click away.\nProbably the 2 most important steps for you to take are:\n\n\n*\n\n*Make a backup.\n\n*Read and understand the installation documentation.\n\nA: When you get to partitioning Select \"Something else\"\nConfirm \"Device for boot loader installation:\" is correct, (If you left your internal HDD plugged in make sure the USB drive root is selected - sdb not sdb1).\n\nA: <@Tarik> If you get complains about missing drives when you run your external install on another machine (Something like 'Press S to skip mounting or M for manual recovery'), you should have a look at /etc/fstab. Here you can either\n\n\n*\n\n*remove the corresponding lines (no more automatic mount at startup), or\n\n*add the nobootwait option to them so that they will be automatically skipped if not present.\n(More info about fstab here).\n\nA: I think the recommendations are really just for safety. You can pick which drive you install onto during the install, so there's no reason you can't just ignore the internal drive and install onto the external, provided you can pick it out of a list.\nBy removing the internal drive, there's no chance of getting it wrong is the general idea.\nYou will just have to choose to boot from the external drive after the install is done, in order to get into your Ubuntu install.\n\nA: I installed Linux Mint on a USB stick while I already had another installation on the hard drive. As a result, it included the hard drive in the boot menu. I then had to edit grub.cfg to remove the unwanted boot menu options. I still have complains of a missing hard drive during boot which I am trying to figure out how to fix. No detrimental effect otherwise.\n", "Q: Email refused - SPF, qmail I'm using a pre-configured virtual server for sending emails. Currently, I'm responsible for it running well. One recipient refused my email and I was pointed to a page explaining it. But to me it explains nothing at all:\nabcde1234 rejected a message that claimed an envelope sender address of somebody@cgc-instruments.de.\nabcde1234 received a message from 1.2.3.4 that claimed an envelope sender address of somebody@cgc-instruments.de.\nHowever, the domain cgc-instruments.com has declared using SPF that it does not send mail through 1.2.3.4. That is why the message was rejected.\n\nIn the above I replaced abcde1234 and 1.2.3.4 for the real values.\nSo my server has declared... maybe it has, how do I find it out without knowing anything about the system? By running ps I've learned that there's qmail running. Why are there no config files in /etc? I've found them in /var/qmail/control, but there's nothing like the above there. Or is it?\n\nA: Not an Ubuntu question, really, but...\nSPF is the Sender Policy Framework. Using DNS, an \"SPF record\" (a TXT record) declares which SMTP servers are allowed to send mail from your domain. Therefore, you must modify the DNS records for cgc-instruments.de to include an SPF record for the SMTP server,  \"pre-configured virtual server .\"\nnslookup\n>set q=any\n>cgc-instruments.de\n\nThe result:\ncgc-instruments.de\n    origin = lvps83-169-21-132.dedicated.hosteurope.de\n    mail addr = ivo\\.cermak.cgc-instruments.com\n    serial = 1262369762\n    refresh = 10800\n    retry = 3600\n    expire = 604800\n    minimum = 10800\ncgc-instruments.de  nameserver = ns2.hans.hosteurope.de.\ncgc-instruments.de  nameserver = lvps83-169-21-132.dedicated.hosteurope.de.\ncgc-instruments.de  text = \"v=spf1 +a +mx -all\"\ncgc-instruments.de  mail exchanger = 10 mail.cgc-instruments.de.\nName:   cgc-instruments.de\nAddress: 83.169.21.132\n\nYou can see the SPF record, version one: 'v=spf1 [...]'\nAlso I have never seen a backslash in a domain name... see this in mail addr?\nIs that right? It does not look right to me.\n", "Q: Not able to install extensions from official website I am using Ubuntu 11.10 and have added gnome3, webupd8/themes/ PPA.

On going to website there was no longer that message but strangly there were no extension listed also. \nSo what am I  doing wrong here? How \n\nA: Things you need to check before trying to install the gnome-shell extensions.\n\n\n*\n\n*You need to have a fully updated gnome-shell and all its libraries (as the message on the site says).\n\n*You should be using Firefox web browser (The site currently doesn't support Google Chrome and other web browsers).\n\n\n\nIf you still cannot install any of the extensions, try resetting GNOME configurations to the default settings.\n\n\n*\n\n*How do I reset GNOME to the defaults?\n\nA: You need to install Gnome 3 first.  \nsudo apt-get install gnome-shell\n\nThen choose 'Gnome' at the login screen where you enter your password. You don't need any PPAs for this, that's a different issue. Gnome 3 is in the software center.\n\nA: Both of the answers are good advice. As you can see, the gnome extensions are in development, and so there are going to be bumps in the road.\n", "Q: WebGL with Firefox And Chrome Salutations!\nSo after getting my new lenovo H330 with Intel graphics I've been trying to get some native client applications working. I typically used the only browser to have NaCl built in by standard which is of course Google chrome. According to the web, Intel mesa drivers that my computer came with (there's no PCI or PCIE graphics card) earlier then 7.9 won't work but according to 'chrome://gui' my version is 7.11. but never the less I could only get some of these NaCl compiled applications working about 7% of the time. We eventually found it was a problem with the Intel mesa graphics not supporting WebGL. You may have seen my previous question here on askubuntu.\nNow for the new twist in this saga. For no reason at all I decided to open Firefox and test some WebGL examples with it. I navigated to http://www.ibiblio.org/e-notes/webgl/webgl.htm and take a guess what happened? Firefox DID work with all the examples I tried and furthermore worked 100% of the time. I went to the same site back with Chrome to find that it DIDN'T work with any of the examples 100% of the time. As far as I can find there isn't any NaCl plugin for Firefox so I can't test the actual applications that failed with Chrome. I tried everything to get Chrome to work like disabling the blacklisted GPU filter in about:flags, making sure WebGL was enabled and using the latest Chrome version. But to no avail.\nSo now. Why does Firefox play nicely with WebGL when Chrome just wants to sit in the corner?\n\nA: I find out that Chromium works with some things that Chrome doesnt, if this help you, WebGL works here.\n", "Q: How can I watch activity of Ubuntu One? \nPossible Duplicate:\nHow to monitor what Ubuntu One is doing? \n\nHow can I watch the activity of Ubuntu One? \nIs it possible to see a detailed list of uploads, downloads and so on? \nCan I see a list of unsynced files? \n\nA: You should install magicicada. That shows you in detail exactly what Ubuntu One file sync is doing at any moment and what's queued up to happen.\n\nA: You can see its log and see what it is doing, if you want to see the network activity you could use programs like wireshark to track the activity of a certain program\nls .cache/ubuntuone/log\n\nThe unsynced files are at:\nmore .cache/ubuntuone/log/syncdaemon-exceptions.log \n\n", "Q: Can't install GNOME Shell extensions from the extensions.gnome.org site \nPossible Duplicate:\nNot able to install extensions from official website \n\nWhen I go to extensions.gnome.org to add shell extensions to my Ubuntu 11.10 box I am getting a notification that I don't have an up to date version of GNOME Shell.  however, I installed the version that I have now from the Ubuntu repositories just today.

Any host in my network that can provide this combo can access the share and edit its contents.\nIs this technically feasible? If yes, how can I do so?\n\nA: There are many things you can do to secure samba from passwords to kerberos.\nFirst, to access the share, you will be using a user name and password configured on the samba server.\nI assume you already have a (login) user.\nYou then assign a samba password to the user\nsudo smbpasswd -a username\nsudo smbpasswd -e username\n\nYou then define your shares in /etc/samba/smb.conf\nsudo -e /etc/samba/smb.conf\n\ngksu gedit /etc/samba/smb.conf\n\nIn the section where you define your shared directory\n[private]\ncomment = private share\npath = /path/to/share/point\nbrowseable = no\nread only = no\nguest ok = no\n\nAfter making those edits, restart the samba server.\nsudo service samba restart\n\nThere are a number of security features for samba, see also\nUbuntu Server Guide Securing Samba\nUbuntu Community Wiki Samba Server Guide\n", "Q: Ulimit and make_sock errors I'm trying to configure Redmine for Ubuntu 11.10, using this\nmethod Redmine for 11.10 but ran into some crazy snag\nsomewhere with apache.

If so, did you try Software Centre? does pretty much what you need. You select the software you want to install from a pretty graphical screen and it takes care of downloading and installing for you.\nYou mention that you'd like to install apps that are not available in Software Center. It'd be useful if you could provide examples. Most common-use applications are packaged and available in USC. Part of the reason is that apps distributed as source are considered of \"intermediate\" difficulty to install, you will need to use the command line for those, and even distros that compile everything, such as Gentoo, require someone to come up with a set of rules for how to compile each application.\nThat said, if you have specific applications that you'd like to see available in Software Center, and it's something that is likely to be of general use, you can request an Ubuntu package by following this procedure.\n\nA: Yes, but not that I know of for Ubuntu. emerge (gentoo) and pacman (arch) are the two tools I am familiar with.\nI think a better question is why are you installing from source code ?\nHere is a great discussion about installing packages outside of your package manager\nhttps://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Package_management_system\nYes it is a Fedora link, but the advice is spot on.\nOther considerations are ;\n\n\n*\n\n*tar balls are just archives. They can contain binary , pre-compiled code (firefox) and scripts with closed source code (nvidia) to install scripts.\n\n*You really should read the README included with source code.\n\n*When you compile from source code, you have to manually resolve dependencies. This is why we make package managers, such as apt and graphical front ends such as the software center.\n\n*One advantage of Ubuntu is the size of the repositories. Use them if the package is in the repos.\n\n*One advantage of .configure is, well to customize the binary. Hard to automate such choices. Usually when I am compiling from source there is a requirement for some tweak. If you are just going to go with the defaults, use apt.\n\n*If you want to do a lot of compiling, use Linux from scratch or gentoo.\nLFS has some tools - http://www.linuxfromscratch.org/alfs/\n\nA: A .tar file can be compared with a .zip file: it is just an archive containing files. It may contain source code, binaries, images, etc. There is no universal way to \"install\" a tarball. If it's source code, you'll often find an INSTALL or README file. Since there is no standard of how those files look like, there is no way to have such a program.\nStandard tools exist for configuring and building applications from source, e.g. autoconf and CMake. These tools are configurable and may not fit in your environment directly.\nTake a car for example. You don't just go to a random seller and buy a random car from him. Instead, you try to find out what your preferences are and whether it suits you and your environment. (if you're very lengthy, you won't pick a small car).\nJust install your software from the Ubuntu Software Center or Muon (for Kubuntu) if possible. Otherwise, have a look at the installation instructions on the website of the application, the README or INSTALL files. If you really want to use a certain program, you shouldn't be afraid of using the terminal if that's necessary. It does not bite you.\n", "Q: Exit Ubuntu Splash Screen Is there a way to exit the splash screen during boot and view the verbose boot without rebooting?\nFor future viewers sake: this is for GRUB2 on Ubuntu.\n\nA: If you use grub2 then the following should do the trick for every installed kernel on every boot:\n\n\n*\n\n*make a backup copy of /etc/default/grub\n\n*Open up /etc/default/grub as root\n\n*Change the line GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT=\"quiet splash\" to GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT=\"\" (if there is more than only quiet and splash between the quotes, keep it!)\n\n*save the changes\n\n*run sudo update-grub\n\n*reboot\n\n\nThis way this change will even be permanent after a kernel update. Also this is the only way that works in grub2 since boot/grub/menu.lst was in grub1 and is not used anymore in grub2.\nMore about configuring grub2 in ubuntu: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Grub2\n\nA: On bootup, press F2.\nNow, you'll have the verbose feedback mode. \n\nA: This works only for grub versions prior than grub2!\nOpen /boot/grub/menu.lst.

Has something changed in gconf?  Might it have anything to do with Gsettings?  In the mean time, I just added --no-desktop to my .desktop shortcuts.  This is not a solid long term solution for me, for a few reasons.  Anytime you upgrade the nautilus package, those changes will overwrite.  Much more importantly,  Anything that launches nautilus another way wont use --no-desktop.  If anyone  can help, it would be much appreciated.\nBTW: gconf-editor let me view my settings, but no schema for nautilus even existed.\n\nA: The setting mentioned in Jo-Erlend Schinstad's answer has been deprecated and I can't find a new equivalent setting. A workaround is to let the file manager set the background but set the alpha to zero. The command for this is\ndconf write /org/gnome/desktop/background/picture-opacity 0\n\nor you can use the dconf-editor gui to set it as discussed in Jo-Erlend Schinstad's answer.\nThe setting to hide the desktop icons is still the same:\ndconf write /org/gnome/desktop/background/show-desktop-icons false\n\n\nA: Yes, in Gnome 3, Gconf is being replaced by DConf, which is accessed through GSettings. You can use dconf-editor from the dconf-tools package to explore. It's very similar to gconf-editor. \nThe entries your looking for are located at org -> gnome -> desktop -> background\nUncheck draw-background AND show-desktop-icons\n\nNo more openbox menu and wallpaper problems :)\n", "Q: what is the best shell command for port state? Let's say, i'd like to know whether certain port (e.g. 21) is open or closed.\nWhat is the best shell command for that?\n\nA: My favorites are:\nFrom a local machine\nsudo lsof -i -n -P \n\nnetstat -an | grep LISTEN | grep -v ^unix\n\nnetstat -ntulp\n\nFrom a remote box\nnmap -v -A ip_address\n\n\nA: netstat will tell you this. To check for all open (listening) ports:\nnetstat -l\n\nYou can also show all current connections:\nnetstat -an\n\nSee the manpage for loads more, netstat is a very powerful tool :)\n\nA: nmap -A -T4 localhost -p 80\n\nIt even shows you OS version and the service on that port\n\nA: You can use telnet to try to connect to a TCP port on a give host:\ntelnet somehost.example.com 21\n\ntries to connect to port 21 on somehost.example.com\nIf the port is closed you get a message like\ntelnet: Unable to connect to remote host: Connection refused\n\notherwise you'll see whatever the program listening on that port tells you on connect.\n", "Q: How can I update diskless installation 11.04 to 11.10 Bonjour messieurs,\nwe have installed on our Ubuntu server 64bit in directory /MNT the distribution of Ubuntu 11.04 32 bit as shared drive for PXE diskless computers in school.\n\n\n*\n\n*Can we upgrade to 11.10? How?\n\n*Can we use NFS 4.0? Is it recommended?\n\n*Can we use Ubuntu software center and install packages with the GUI?\n\n*Is possible to use 1 Gbit connection between NFS PXE server and diskless computers?\n\n\nI'm not Linux expert, but I hope it is possible. Our admin said, do not use GUI packager in 11.04, there is some NFS LOCKING problem. I hope that 11.10 is the general solution.\nIn the fact, we have HDDs in all computers and we are using them for swapping only. The idea is to have only one installation for all computers in the school for easier servicing.\n\nA: This sounds like an upgrade that should not be done blindly - if you break that install then no computer in your school will be able to boot!\nI don't see any reason 11.10 wouldn't work where 11.04 did for a PXE/NFS server setup. I would try doing a fresh install into a new directory and exporting that to a couple of clients first to check compatibility.\nIf it works, it sounds like you would want to chroot into /mnt and use do-release-upgrade to update it. But it's quite difficult to answer this properly without full technical details.\nTo point 2) I'm aware of no problems with NFS4 for this kind of setup, it is the currently accepted de-facto standard.\nTo point 4) 1Gb is no problem for an PXE/NFS server so long as your hardware supports it.\n", "Q: How to run dockbarx under unity and GNOME-Shell? I have installed dockbarx manually from gnome-look, but I can't start it when I search for it in the dash; I only see dockbarx preference. So how do I run it and autostart(add to startup) it when Ubuntu starts, and how to run it under GNOME Shell?\n\nA: To run DockBarX as a stand-alone dock, press ALT + F2 and type:\ndockx\n\nTo add it to startup, add the same command to your startup applications list.\n", "Q: How to enable silent automatic updates for any repository? I read here how to enable silent automatic updates for Google Chrome. However, I have other repositories like spotify, docky and others for which I would like to enable silent updates. \nI am trying to do this in my Ubuntu 10.04 system. But this question applies to all Ubuntu versions. I have the unattended-upgrades package installed.\nHow can I do this? \n\nA: First, install gksu:\nsudo apt-get install gksu\n\nThe easiest way of enabling unattended updates for your system is to edit the file 50unattended-upgrades inside /etc/apt/apt.conf.d/ with your favourite text editor, for example:\ngksu gedit /etc/apt/apt.conf.d/50unattended-upgrades\n\nIn it you need to comment out the commented sections of the Allowed Origins block.\nChange:\nUnattended-Upgrade::Allowed-Origins {\n        \"${distro_id} ${distro_codename}-security\";\n//      \"${distro_id} ${distro_codename}-updates\";\n//      \"${distro_id} ${distro_codename}-proposed\";\n//      \"${distro_id} ${distro_codename}-backports\";\n};\n\nto:\nUnattended-Upgrade::Allowed-Origins {\n        \"${distro_id} ${distro_codename}-security\";\n        \"${distro_id} ${distro_codename}-updates\";\n//      \"${distro_id} ${distro_codename}-proposed\";\n//      \"${distro_id} ${distro_codename}-backports\";\n};\n\n\nFor software that is not on the Ubuntu repos that you would like to update, you need to add an origin and archive to the file. To find what those are for your PPAs, open the folder /var/lib/apt/lists/, that is the storage area for state information for each package resource. What you are looking for is the files that end with Release in the name.\nOpen one with your text editor, e.g. for Google Chrome:\ngedit /var/lib/apt/lists/dl.google.com_linux_chrome_deb_dists_stable_Release\n\nInside you will see something like the following:\nOrigin: Google, Inc.\nLabel: Google\nSuite: stable\nCodename: stable\nVersion: 1.0\nDate: Thu, 17 Nov 2011 19:09:01 +0000\nArchitectures: i386 amd64\nComponents: main\nDescription: Google chrome-linux repository.\n\nThe origin is obvious (Origin: Google, Inc.) and the archive will be whatever is under the line Suite (Suite: stable).\nIf either Origin or Suite is missing, then they will be the empty string. But note that if both are missing, then probably it will not be possible to use that source with unattended upgrades without including other sources with the same issue.\nAfter you noted those 2 lines, you need to edit the 50unattended-upgrades file and add the lines using this format \"<origin>:<archive>\"; of for this example's sake \"Google\\, Inc.:stable\";.\nGoogle Chrome's origin is kinda tricky, because it has a space, an end pointn and a comma in it, but most Release files will be easy to read.\nAs another example, Node JS source specifies an origin (Node Source) but not an archive; so you can match it with \"Node Source:\";.\nAllowed Origins is matched using shell-style wildcards (more specifically, with Python's fnmatch()). If you're careful enough to not include conflicting sources, it's possible to write things like \"Node *:*\";.\n\nDo not forget to make a backup of your 50unattended-upgrades file before editing it. Do that with:\nsudo cp /etc/apt/apt.conf.d/50unattended-upgrades /etc/apt/apt.conf.d/50unattended-upgrades.bak\n\nTo test the changes done on the file, you can use sudo unattended-upgrades with the parameters --dry-run and --debug.\n\n*\n\n*--dry-run will run an unattended upgrades cycle, except it will not really install the upgrades, only check and verify that everything is ok.\n\n\n*--debug will enable verbose mode.\nYou can always check the logs for unattended-upgrades at /var/log/unattended-upgrades/unattended-upgrades.log.\n\nYou can change the configuration of the unattended upgrades by editing the file /etc/apt/apt.conf.d/10periodic. Options for the configuration are in the /etc/cron.daily/apt script header. Read them to configure the frequency of the unattended upgrades.\n\nA: There are instructions for forcing a rerun to make cron start the automatic update at the following link.\nThe procedure to stop cron is this\nsudo service anacron stop\nsudo service cron stop\nsudo rm -rf /var/run/unattend* /var/run/cron* /var/run/anacron*\nsudo rm -rf /var/lib/apt/periodic/*\n\nand to restart cron to make the automatic update happen now (or at least within a few miutes) is\nsudo service cron start\nsudo anacron -fn\n\nHow it works\nSeveral things will trigger it to run.\n\n\n*\n\n*It is fired off from the running of /etc/cron.daily by cron, specifically /etc/cron.daily/apt. Cron runs /etc/cron.daily at 6.25 am (see /etc/crontab)\n\n*Anacron runs from upstart? and it will fire off /etc/cron.daily after 5 minutes of uptime (see /etc/anacrontab)\nNote APT::Periodic::RandomSleep can be set in\n/etc/apt/apt.conf.d/10periodic, but defaults to 1800s (30 mins) so no\nupdates may happen till 30 mins after /etc/cron.daily/apt runs.\nLog\nIf it works things should get logged in this folder, /var/log/unattended-upgrades.\n\nA: Automated approach for @Bruno Pereira's answer:\n(Please consider starring the github repo if you find the answer useful.)\nCode Link: https://github.com/abhigenie92/unattended_upgrades_repos\n\n\n*\n\n*Check repositories to add:\n$ python automatic_upgrade.py \nAdd repos:\n\"Ubuntu:xenial\";\n\"LP-PPA-kubuntu-ppa-backports:xenial\";\n\"LP-PPA-tuxonice:xenial\";\n\"LP-PPA-webupd8team-sublime-text-3:xenial\";\n\nSkipping files due to not present origin or suite.

Is there any way for me to push specific bits into a new file, without creating temporary files and then concatenating them?\nFor example, I want to create a 10 octets file, where the first three are set to 4, the next two to 7 and the final five to 32.\n\n0000.0100 0000.0100 0000.0100 0000.0111 0000.0111 0010.0000 0100.0000 0010.0000 0010.0000 0010.0000\n\nI need a solution that would allow me to create large files, where specific bits are repeated many times.\n\nA: In ruby, writing the pattern 10 times: \nFile.open('bits','w') do |f|\n    10.times do\n        f << ([0x04]*3+[0x07]*2+[0x20]*5).pack('C*')\n    end\nend\n\nBy writing to the file on each iteration, we only ever hold a single copy of the bit pattern in memory. That way you can write arbitrarily large files by changing the 10.times to 10000.times etc.\nSo from the command line:\n$ ruby -e \"File.open('bits','w'){|f|10.times{f<<([0x04]*3+[0x07]*2+[0x20]*5).pack('C*')}}\"\n\nThen check the file:\n$ xxd -b bits \n0000000: 00000100 00000100 00000100 00000111 00000111 00100000  ..... \n0000006: 00100000 00100000 00100000 00100000 00000100 00000100      ..\n000000c: 00000100 00000111 00000111 00100000 00100000 00100000  ...   \n0000012: 00100000 00100000 00000100 00000100 00000100 00000111    ....\n0000018: 00000111 00100000 00100000 00100000 00100000 00100000  .     \n000001e: 00000100 00000100 00000100 00000111 00000111 00100000  ..... \n0000024: 00100000 00100000 00100000 00100000 00000100 00000100      ..\n000002a: 00000100 00000111 00000111 00100000 00100000 00100000  ...   \n0000030: 00100000 00100000 00000100 00000100 00000100 00000111    ....\n0000036: 00000111 00100000 00100000 00100000 00100000 00100000  .     \n000003c: 00000100 00000100 00000100 00000111 00000111 00100000  ..... \n0000042: 00100000 00100000 00100000 00100000 00000100 00000100      ..\n0000048: 00000100 00000111 00000111 00100000 00100000 00100000  ...   \n000004e: 00100000 00100000 00000100 00000100 00000100 00000111    ....\n0000054: 00000111 00100000 00100000 00100000 00100000 00100000  .     \n000005a: 00000100 00000100 00000100 00000111 00000111 00100000  ..... \n0000060: 00100000 00100000 00100000 00100000                        \n\nSee the documentation for Array.pack here.\n\nA: This is quite simple in Python. You can start the interactive interpreter by just typing python and do something like this:\n>>> open(\"test.bin\", \"wb\").write(\"\\4\\4\\4\\7\\7\\32\\32\\32\\32\\32\")\n\n'wb' means \"open the file for writing binary data to it\", merely opening the file with w will assume you want to write text to it. \nNote these are octal numbers (\\32 is 0x1a, or 26)! They can also be hexadecimal (\\xff), and you can save some typing by doing something like this:\n>>> \"\\x00\" * 4 + \"\\x09\"\n'\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x09'\n\nThe normal operator precedence applies.\nFor more data, you can use lists of decimal integers - which I find easier to read and type:\n>>> d = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]\n>>> ''.join(chr(i) for i in d)\n'\\x01\\x02\\x03\\x04\\x05'\n\nIf you prefer using python3, you'd use bytes() like this:\n>>> bytes([1, 2, 3, 4, 5])\n\nOf course 'arithmetic' works as you would expect:\n>>> [1, 2, 3] * 2 + [9] * 4 + range(4)\n[1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3, 9, 9, 9, 9, 0, 1, 2, 3]\n>>> range(10, 0, -3)\n[10, 7, 4, 1]\n\nBinary, orcal and hexadecimal literals are written like this:\n0b1100 == 0o14 == 12 == 0xc\n\n(Or 014 if you prefer) \nIf you want to do some complicated stuff, open the file first and then gradually write to it:\n>>> f = open(\"test.bin\", \"wb\")\n>>> f.write(\"\\xff\" * 100)\n>>> for i in range(10):\n...     f.write(\"\\xff\\xfa\\x03\")\n...\n>>> f.close()\n\nAnd if you want to script it, you can use the -c switch to invoke the code directly from the command line:\npython -c \"open('test.bin', 'wb').write(''.join(chr(i) for i in [1, 2, 3]))\"\n\n", "Q: What is default shell for terminal?

Most of the system is noticeably slower then previous releases and requires a faster computer to run smoothly (does not mean you cannot run).\nWith your computer specs I would recommend that you run Ubuntu 10.10 (change the release on the dropbox Download Options) or running any Ubuntu alternatives with a lighter desktop environment, ie: xubuntu or lubuntu.\nIf you still think Ubuntu is the way and 11.10 is the release to go then you should be for sure using Unity2D instead of the default Unity3D.\nThere are some tweaks that you might do and get some very limited boost in performance, but those take more work than should and the difference in the end will barely be noticeable \n\nA: Your computer is simply not very fast hardware-wise. You would be well advised to install Lubuntu, a less pretty but faster Ubuntu derivative for running on systems with limited resources. At the least, use Unity 2D. This will hog less resources. You can use Unity 2D at the login screen by clicking the gear icon and selecting \"Unity 2D\" before logging in.

I checked for questions that covered my problem and I found this question, and I tried the solution, but was still unable to boot. I've also checked for solutions in the Ubuntu bug database but I haven't been able to get any of them to work.\nWhen I boot 3.0.0-14 (or -12 or -13) in recovery, all I get is a line like\nrtc_cmos 00:05: setting system clock to <blah>\n\nand nothing happens after that. There's no response to keyboard input, including Ctrl-Alt-Delete.\nDoes anyone know a solution to this problem? I'm booting in an old 2.6.38 kernel for now, but this will start getting obnoxious after I forget that I have to do this.\nUPDATE:\nThe system is indeed totally unresponsive to keyboard input. Neither the Magic SysRq keys nor the Ctrl-Alt-F# will work. Changing video mode at startup also does not work.\nThere were lots of packages that were upgraded, but the ones that could mess up the boot as far as I could tell would only be the kernel and acipid. I reinstalled those, to no avail.\n\nA: The rtc_cmos message is one of the last messages before many of the graphical boot screen programs take over.\nSo, debugging thoughts: can you check the timestamps of packages in your package cache (/var/cache/apt/archive) and see what packages installed? What happens if you try switching virtual terminals after waiting a sufficient amount of time for bootup? (ctrl+alt+f1/ctrl+alt+f2/etc.). Is it locked up or just locked? Do the Magic SysRq keys work? \nMy guess is that this is a graphics card/graphics related situation, so to eliminate that option, it might be worthwhile to try booting with a different framebuffer configuration. See http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/VESA_BIOS_Extensions#Linux_video_mode_numbers\nOf course, in the interim time, you can always reconfigure grub to default to a different kernel.

How to setup VM / VM config file so that it supports booting from iSCSI??\n\nA: Looking at this like a virtualization problem doesn't help. Ask yourself, how would I boot from iSCSI in the real world? The answer is you need an iSCSI initiator. Virtualization isn't magic, it emulates a common computer with common peripherals, you can add new peripherals, albeit virtual ones, just like could in the real world. In this case the gPXE project provides an option rom that can be fed to QEMU to add the additional ability of an iSCSI initiator. Everything else is an exercise for the reader.

I was able to connect wirelessly to my router and stay connected for about a minute. After that it would disconnect and my router would be disabled: none of my other wireless devices would see the signal any longer, as if it disappeared. I would have to cycle the router's power toggle off/on to get it to come back on and put out a signal again. This happened repeatedly. \nI experienced no other problems trying the software (i.e., accessed my files w/o issue).

How do I go about handling this?\nThe only changes since my last install: I had a new graphics card (ATI Radeon 5450 1GB, a huge upgrade from my Radeon 3450 256 MB), and upgraded Ubuntu from 10.10 to 11.04. This in no way should be it hanging due to hardware constraints, the graphics card is sufficient for 3 monitors (through eyefinity), I only use about 3 of 6 GB of ram at a time, and processing stays under 25% (I have a little applet, I can watch it all the time).\nHow do I start debugging this and any ideas on a particular problem?\n\nA: The first step to debugging is going to be checking your system logs.  To do this your going to want to open a terminal and change directories to /var/log, to do this type:\ncd /var/log\n\nin the terminal.\nThen with the text editor of your choice view the kernel ring buffer message.  I'll use gedit for this example.\ngedit dmesg\n\nAnother helpful log will be the messages log.  This displays information about applications and system processes.  To view this run:\ngedit messages\n\nAnd if you don't find anything that stands out in those two, check the systems log by running\ngedit syslog\n\nWhen your system \"hangs\" make note of the time, and then when your looking through the logs you can go to that time in the log and look for inconsistencies.  If you see anything that stands out you can edit your question and copy/paste in that part of the log.\nFor more information on the various log files and what they do:  https://help.ubuntu.com/community/LinuxLogFiles\n", "Q: One SSD, two computers (with different video cards). Best approach for video drivers? I have a single SSD I dual-boot with Windows 7 / Ubuntu 11.10. I switch this drive daily between two computers. One is a laptop with integrated Intel graphics. The other is a desktop with an NVIDIA video card.  \nI want the correct driver to be used and 3D acceleration to be enabled automatically when I boot into Ubuntu on either computer. How do I achieve this?\nWhen I boot Ubuntu with my laptop most drivers start up normally, but GM965 video driver doesn't load, therefore 3D acceleration remains off. The logs show the NVIDIA driver issuing an error about unavailability (looks like it's forcing the NVIDIA driver).\nIs normal that Ubuntu 11.10 & Xorg nowadays don't have the same behavior as Windows 7? When I boot Windows 7 the right driver is loaded by PCI identification, and resolution settings are loaded via DDC from the monitor. I think Xorg can do the same thing like when you boot a live CD.\nIn order to diagnose I need to know how to configure video driver on modern Xorg deployments that deprecates /etc/X11/xorg.conf\nDoes anyone have any ideas to help me?\nThanks in advance\n\nA: Bodhi.zazens answer is a step in the right direction, but you'll possibly be unable to use GL capabilities of you Intel card (e.g. desktop effects).\nA more polished script that uses the vendor ID of nVidia and corrects the GL library paths is shown below. Before installing this script, you need to save the nvidia xorg configuration to /etc/X11/xorg.conf.nvidia. On the nvidia machine, run the below commands:\nsudo nvidia-xconfig\nsudo mv /etc/X11/xorg.conf{,.nvidia}\n\nThe below script should be saved as /etc/init/auto-gfx-card.conf. When copying, be careful not to put spaces after the trailing backslashes.\ndescription \"autoconfigure graphics card settings\"\nstart on (filesystem and (starting lightdm or starting kdm or starting gdm))\nscript\n    # If any nVidia device is found, assume it to be a graphics card\n    if [ -n \"$(lspci -d10de:)\" ]; then\n        for arch in x86_64-linux-gnu i386-linux-gnu; do\n            # since nvidia drivers have a higher priority, it'll\n            # automatically selected as the best available version\n            update-alternatives --quiet --force --auto ${arch}_gl_conf || true\n        done\n        # create the symlink, overwriting existing links if necessary\n        ln -sf /etc/X11/xorg.conf.nvidia /etc/X11/xorg.conf\n    else\n        # restore Intel GL capabilities\n        for arch in x86_64-linux-gnu i386-linux-gnu; do\n            update-alternatives --quiet --force --set \\\n                ${arch}_gl_conf /usr/lib/$arch/mesa/ld.so.conf 2>/dev/null || true\n        done\n        # remove the symlink if any\n        rm -f /etc/X11/xorg.conf\n    fi\nend script\n\nNo further commands are necessary to activate this Upstart job.\n\nA: It is a messy hack, and there is probably a cleaner method (ie writing a nice upstart init script), but ...\nAssuming both the nvidia driver and intel card are working ;)\nUse a script in /etc/rc.local to use the correct xorg.conf. The intel card should not need a xorg.conf, so save the working nvidia xorg.conf at say /etc/X11/xorg.conf.nvida\nWhile running the nvidia machine\nsudo cp /etc/X11/xorg.conf /etc/X11/xorg.conf.nvidia\n\nThen add this to /etc/rc.local\n# determine if we have a nvidia card, $VIDEO will be an empty sting with the intel card\nVIDEO=$(lspci | grep nVidia)\n\n# test if $VIDEO is empty, and move xorg.conf if needed\nif [ -n \"$VIDEO\" ]\n    then\n        # if xorg.conf exists, remove it.\n        [[ -e /etc/X11/xorg.conf ]] && rm -f /etc/X11.xorg.conf\n    else\n        # if xorg.conf does not exist copy it\n        [[ -e /etc/X11/xorg.conf ]] || cp /etc/X11/xorg.conf.nvidia /etc/X11/xorg.conf\n fi\n\n # restart lightdm, need to modify for kdm or gdm\n /etc/init.d/lightdm restart\n\nDepending on how fast rc.local runs you may be able to skip the lightdm restart altogether or if it runs too early you may need to add a sleep.\nIf you need an xorg.conf for the intel card, simply modify the script to put the correct xorg.conf into place.\nThe only other potential problem would be if the nvidia kernel module conflicts with the intel driver (unlikely), in that event we would need to blacklist drivers, which can be done with a custom stanza in grub.\n\nA: This is probably a bad idea. You can't use the NVIDIA driver with your laptop's integrated Intel graphics. Since you have the unusual practice of sharing a single SSD between two different computers, you should probably stick with the 'lowest common denominator' here, which is the default video drivers. \nIf you still want to install and configure the restricted NVIDIA drivers, do so on the desktop, which has a compatible video card.  \nClick the gear icon, top right of your screen and choose 'System settings...' then click on 'Additional Drivers'. This will show you any available or enabled proprietary drivers from NVIDIA, like this:  \n \nTo access the settings for the card after installing the drivers, type 'NVIDIA' in the dash, like this:  \n \nThis brings up the driver's settings screen. Make any changes you want here and then click the 'Save to X configuration file, like shown here:  \n \nFor more on configuring X here is the Ubuntu X/Config wiki page \nBe aware that if you do this you may run into problems on the laptop, which does not have a NVIDIA card.\n", "Q: Allocating drive space for dual boot I've tried installing Ubuntu 11.04 along with windows 7.

I've about 35 GB free in C drive and win7 is installed in drive C.\nPlease help me out in allocating drive space for dual boot.\n\nA: You can only create four primary partitions on a hard disk. In your case, you already have 3 primary partitions. So, you will need to create logical partitions from now onwards. Just to clarify, you can create 3 primary partitions, plus as many logical partitions as you want.\nUbuntu requires minimum two partitions to work. These are \"/\" and \"swap\".\nWhen installing Ubuntu, you will have to create two logical partitions. The Ubuntu installer will give you the option to do so.\nSo, make some free space by moving as many items as possible away from E to some other place. Then, go to Control Panel. Click on \"View by Category\" in the top right. Then go to Systems and Security > Administrative Tools > Computer Management > Storage > Disk Management. Right click on E and then \"Shrink Volume\".

Once configured in your .bashrc it'll prompt for the passphrase of the key(s) you asked it to manage only when you launch the first terminal after login and makes sure every new terminal knows about your ssh-agent.\n\nA: To resolve the issue of entering the password multiple times, enter this command the first\ntime you open a terminal:\nssh-add \n\nNo need to enter the password until you log out.\n\nA: It should be automatic if you've set up the ssh key on both systems.  With a default installation, I've never had to do anything else.\nIn case you haven't done this, here is the way it's done:\nGenerate the key (either RSA or DSA).  I think RSA is more common.\nssh-keygen -t rsa\n\nor\nssh-keygen -t dsa\n\nTransfer the key to the remote system:\nssh-copy-id *username* @ *hostname*\n\nIf not using the standard port 22:  (note quotes are required around argument)\nssh-copy-id *username* @ *hostname* -p *portnum*\"\n\nIf using DSA, you need to use a something like:\nssh-copy-id -i *path*  *to*   id_dsa\n\nOnce I've done that, I get the dialog.  In the past, I  remember that if I ran the terminal in a certain way, it wouldn't give the dialog, but I can't remember the details.  I think it was when I created a hotkey for a custom command to set the directory due to a bug where the terminal kept coming up in the root directory even though it knew my home directory. \n\nA: I've added this as a new answer because I didn't want it to get last in my other answer.  \nI have found that if you start gnome-terminal, or xterm or other terminals (I believe) from a custom hotkey rather than the built in hotkey or menu, then it behaves totally differently for SSH, and will not use the keyring.  In fact, when I just tried it on my system after remembering this problem, I actually got an error, where it always works from the default methods.\n\nA: If gnome's gui doesn't prompt you for the password it could mean that gnome-keyring-d is not running\nor it is in an invalid state.\nI would check if the process is running:\nps -e | grep gnome-keyring-d\n\nIf it is then kill it:\nkillall -9 gnome-keyring-d\n\nThen restart it\ngnome-keyring-daemon\n\nAfter that when I do ssh <remotehost> I get the gui prompt and the ssh-agent under the hood doing\nit's job.\n", "Q: How do I hide an 'unshared' directory?

I have used it for years (running on Windows, or using Wine) for remote access, terminal emulation, and (dispersed) network management.

But the ssh output the errlog with \\r, so we replaced them before passing into grep.\n\nAccording to my test, ssh will only recognize the first -o ProxyCommand=XXX in commandline, even if there's second ProxyCommand option in the cmdline, or there's ProxyCommand in ~/.ssh/config, so our method will be very very stable ;)\nFor ssh\n#!/usr/bin/env bash\nORISSH=/usr/bin/ssh\nssh_dryrun=$($ORISSH -v -o \"ProxyCommand=FAKE_PROXY_STUB %h %p\" \"$@\" 2>&1 | sed -e 's/\\r/\\n/g')\nhost=$( grep -oP 'Applying options for \\K(.*?)$' <<< $ssh_dryrun | head -n 1 )\n\nif [[ $host == \"*\" ]]; then\n  password=''\nelse\n  password=`awk \"/#Password/ && inhost { print \\\\\\$2 } /^Host/ { inhost=0 } /Host $host$/ { inhost=1 }\" ~/.ssh/config`\nfi\n\nif [[ -z \"$password\" ]]; then\n  $ORISSH \"$@\"\nelse\n  sshpass -p $password $ORISSH \"$@\"\nfi\n\nFor scp:\n#!/usr/bin/env bash\nORISCP=/usr/bin/scp\nscp_dryrun=$($ORISCP -v -o \"ProxyCommand=proxyhost %h %p\" \"$@\" 2>&1 | sed -e 's/\\r/\\n/g')\nhost=$( grep -oP 'Applying options for \\K(.*?)$' <<< $scp_dryrun | head -n 1 )\n\nif [[ $host == \"*\" ]]; then\n  password=\"\"\nelse\n  password=`awk \"/#Password/ && inhost { print \\\\\\$2 } /^Host/ { inhost=0 } /Host $host$/ { inhost=1 }\" ~/.ssh/config`\nfi\n\nif [[ -z \"$password\" ]]; then\n  $ORISCP \"$@\"\nelse\n  sshpass -p $password $ORISCP \"$@\"\nfi\n\n\nA: If you don't really want to use a public/private key pair, you can write an expect script to enter the password for you automatically depending on the destination address.\nEdit: What I mean is that you can have a script that, on one hand, uses expect to enter the password for you and, on the other hand, reads the password for a given user and host from a configuration file. For example, the following python script will work for the sunny day scenario:\n#!/usr/bin/python                                                                                                                        \nimport argparse\nfrom ConfigParser import ConfigParser\nimport pexpect\n\ndef main(args):\n    url = args.url\n    user, host = url.split('@', 1)\n\n    cfg_file = 'ssh.cfg'\n    cfg = ConfigParser()\n    cfg.read(cfg_file)\n    passwd = cfg.get(user, host)\n\n    child = pexpect.spawn('ssh {0}'.format(url))\n    child.expect('password:')\n    child.sendline(passwd)\n    child.interact()\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    parser = argparse.ArgumentParser(description='Run ssh through pexpect')\n    parser.add_argument('url')\n    args = parser.parse_args()\n    main(args)\n\nand the configuration file format would be as follows:\n[user_1]\nhost1 = passwd_1\nhost2 = passwd_2\n\n[user_2]\nhost1 = passwd_1\nhost2 = passwd_2\n\nNote: As explained, the python script would need to be much more complex to handle all the possible errors and question messages from ssh and all the possible URLs (in the example it's assumed that it will be something like user@host, but the user part isn't used most of the times), but the basic idea would still be the same. Regarding the configuration file, you may use a different configuration file or use .ssh/config and write your own code to parse that file and get the password for a given user and host.\n\nA: How about ProxyCommand:\nHost Home-raw\n    HostName test.com\nHost Home\n   User netmoon\n   Port 22\n   ProxyCommand sshpass -pmypass ssh netmoon@%h-raw nc localhost %p\n\nYou can use ssh -W instead of nc as well:\nProxyCommand sshpass -pmypass ssh netmoon@%h-raw -W localhost:%p\n\n\nA: There also is sshpass program for that.\nHow to use:\nsshpass -p MyPa55word ssh me@myservor.com\n\nA: Thanks, Arek for the inspiration...\nRather than running another shell process, this is just a function running in the current bash shell.

I thought that's a Windows issue only.\n\nA: Use iotop to look at what processes are doing I/O.\n\nA: You need to put the computer into power save mode:\nsudo pm-powersave true\n\nLess frequent writes to the disk means if you crash you can lose more work though.\n", "Q: Does anyone know how to create pretty + cool conky? Does anyone know how to make pretty cool conky step by step?\n\nA: \"cool\" is very subjective. I would start on the conky site, there are some sample configurations with screen shots\nhttp://conky.sourceforge.net/screenshots.html\nIf you wish, there are a graphical tools to help with configuration\nI like conkywizard\nhttp://gnome-look.org/content/show.php/ConkyWizard?content=126352\n\nThere is also a conky gui on sourceforge\nhttp://conkygui.sourceforge.net/pages/home\nFrom there, conky is very flexible, sort of depends on what you want. You are going to have better luck if you as a more specific question about some specific feature you desire.\n", "Q: multitouch support for magic mouse on further releases? In older questions on internet i found that the magic-mouse multitouch-support should work since 11.04. Now we have 11.10 and i didn't find any news, that here is a multitouch-support planned for 12.04.\nAlso the official touch-homepage doesn't says anything about a planned support for this device.\nhttps://wiki.ubuntu.com/Multitouch/HardwareSupport\nDoes anyone knows more? Is there hope for multitouch-support of magic-mouse in further releases?? Does anyone knows concrete plans?\nI own this mouse and it supports only:\n- one finger \n- vertical/horizontal scroll\n- right, left and middle - click\nThis mouse is very useful and it could be much more if it would be supported like the apple magic trackpad. \n\nA: Ubuntu does not have a driver or any compatibility written in yet. That is the most basic answer there is. Someone might have written a driver for the magic mouse, but I haven't seen any drivers yet. 12.04 will probably have support for it since it is a LTS, so there is hope.\nAlso the reason it only supports basic functions is because that is all that is written for it, since the average mouse only has those features.\n", "Q: configure mdadm for existing intel rapid storage array i have a raid 1 configured by intel rapid storage from the bios.\nwith windows i have an application which manage the raid.\ni read about intel rapid storage for linux and found that the option is to install mdadm.\nnow i'm trying to apply the configuration in ubuntu but i haven't found how to do it.\ni don't want to break the raid or recreate it.\nsomeone knows how to do it?\n\nA: dmraid is the primary toolset which drives platform independent software RAID aka \"Fake RAID\". mdadm can handle some of the fake RAID formats, you likely need to manually assemble the RAID. See man mdadm.\nhttp://www.intel.com/support/chipsets/imsm/sb/cs-020663.htm\n\nA: The recommended way to use Intel Matrix Storage Management capable drives is via mdadm\nYou can do so safely with mdadm in Quantal (3.2.5)\nOr install the quantal version in precise (pending an sru)\nOr you can compile from source.\n\nA: ok, after determining again the situation, i've understood that my Intel Rapid Storage mirror RAID has been configured as dmraid because the first time i've configured it was for windows 7 (intel rapid storage software for windows support only dmraid variation).\ni've managed to see the details by running \"sudo dmraid -s\".\nmy RAID device is listed as /dev/dm-0 (and linked from /dev/mapper/isw_[raid set]_[array's name from BIOS]\nin case of failure, i saw that in order to rebuild the RAID one need to run \"sudo dmraid -R [raid set]\n\"sudo dmraid -r\" will show which devices listed as part of raid sets.\nIntel Rapid Storage in Linux PDF\n", "Q: Start the unity panel through the command line? In previous versions of Ubuntu I could start the panel by typing gnome-panel into a terminal. This would cause the top and bottom panels to appear, helpful, for example, if I was in a different desktop environment at the moment (e.g., Openbox) and wanted to open the panel. Is there an equivalent command to start the unity panel from the command line? Any help would be greatly appreciated.\n\nA: Type unity in terminal and it should start unity.\n"]
