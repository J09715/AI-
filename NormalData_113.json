["Q: Unity 3d not working after Ubuntu 12.04 upgrade \nPossible Duplicate:\nUnity doesn't load, no Launcher, no Dash appears \n\nunity 2d is working fine, but nothing is displayed( except wallpaper) using unity 3d.\nI have tried unity --reset, but it indicated :\nunity-panel services : no such process\nI have already purges and reinstalled unity-services.\nAlso I have checked the Unity plugin option in ccsm, but it goes 'uncheck' after every restart.\n\nA: Happening with me as well. Using Docky (which is working just fine) I can get to any application and it all works fine. Screenlets don't start. I got into software center and synaptic but couldn't identify anything I had updated that looked off. I am using 2D right now.

If your friend has removed a kernel module in /lib/modules/.../kernel/drivers/...., a reinstallation of the kernel package as described below suffices.\nThe wireless drivers are contained in the kernel package, so reinstalling the linux-image-...-generic package (where ... is the kernel version) should be enough. The terminal command for reinstalling the current loaded kernel is:\nsudo apt-get install --reinstall linux-image-$(uname -r)\n\n", "Q: Pushing custom updates to Ubuntu remixes I've created a custom distribution of Ubuntu (a \"remix\") that I'd like to start distributing, but want to continue improving via updates.\nAny suggestions on the best methods of pushing custom updates?

Firefox takes upto 850MB RAM with only six or seven tabs opened and all the tabs loaded with light weight websites only. I wonder why would a browser consume so much memory. It keeps increasing its memory consumption over time. I have 3GB RAM and most of the times firefox consumes upto 30% of my memory. How do I fix this? \nEDIT: \nThe output of the command sudo iotop -oPa as asked by @Jippie\n\n\nA: Without specifying what you're doing exactly, it's hard to say this is an actual problem.\nThere's a common misconception that utilizing a lot of memory is bad.  However, unused memory is a waste.  It's like keeping a warehouse mostly empty because you think it's cleaner.  By keeping as much as you can in memory, it saves having to go to disk and also reloading content needlessly.  As long as the program is good about letting go of memory it doesn't absolutely require to other programs, it's not a problem.  \nIf it's a memory leak on the other hand, that would be a big problem.  You can check this by closing all your tabs except say a blank one.  Then start loading other memory intensive programs.  If you have another browser installed, like Chrome, start loading massive pages in it.  If Firefox is still showing massive memory usage, then it's a leak.  Your system will likely become sluggish from the other programs demanding unavailable memory.\nIt might be Firefox, but often it's an add-on or combination of add-ons causing the leak.  You can disable all add-ons by starting Firefox in safe-mode from the terminal, firefox -safe-mode, to see if you have the same thing happen.\nIf you're saying that with just a few \"light\" websites open, and not doing anything in Firefox, that Firefox just starts taking up more and more memory, then it's plausible it's just Flash or some script going nuts.  This is why I put \"light\" in quotes.  It's unbelievable how badly some simple-looking sites are designed.\n\nA: try restarting firefox with addons disabled.\nsometimes addons can cuase problems.\n@jippie i think he has checked from system monitor\nif the solution works then you have to remove some addons\n\nA: Try this link by Mozilla Zine article database that addresses this question. http://kb.mozillazine.org/Memory_Leak\nBest of luck!\n", "Q: Who decides what category the software in the Ubuntu Software Centre is filed under, and who can we report errors to? I noticed when browsing through the Ubuntu Software Centre that some programs seem to be placed in the wrong categories, for example Pinta, an image editor, appears under Developer Tools (instead of Graphics) in my list of installed programs.\n\nIs this a case of the developer incorrectly categorising their software when they uploaded it to the software centre, or does Canonical decided what goes where?\nAnd if we notice an obvious mistake who do we inform, the software developer or file a bug somehow?\n\nA: This is probably an error in how software-center parses the .desktop file of Pinta. \nSome common reasons why an application ends up in the wrong categories:\n\n\n*\n\n*The Categories option in the .desktop file of the application is incorrect.\n\n*Software-center interpreted the application wrongly. You can read about how the software-center classifies the applications into various categories here.\n\n*A stale .desktop file got stuck in the app-install-data, which makes the application to be classified wrongly. \n\n\n\nIf you think an application is categorized under a wrong section, file a bug report against the package and software-center in Launchpad. \n\n\n*\n\n*How do I report a bug?\nYou can follow how to report such a bug report by following this similar bug report against GParted.\n\nA: I believe packages can appear in multiple categories, and so when they are selecting categories for a package they include as many as reasonably possible in an attempt to give packages a fair chance at being seen by showing up in all/any categories someone might look for it in.\nThis is just a guess though, and I don't know who you would categorization errors to, hopefully someone else can help out there.\n\nA: I know that there is also a place in the deb packages which the makers of them specify a place in the menu.  I would think that would be the same place the Software Center would retrieve the imformation.  Just extract the contents of one those packages from dotdeb.com and navigate to /usr/share/applications.  Drag and drop the Icon you see there into gedit and look at the line which starts with the word \"Categories\"\n", "Q: Resource Graphs in top panel?

Try doing the script/terminal instructions above but substitute 'lists.old2' for 'lists.old' and everything should be fine (assuming the problem is, as it claims, that the directory is not empty).\nIf not then you can always try to use aptitude to solve the problem because, as far as I'm aware, it uses different lists than apt-get but can resolve the same dependency structures (sudo aptitude update && sudo aptitude upgrade) or use the aptitude shell (just type aptitude and hit enter, it will prompt you for root when it needs it) which is interactive and offers more options to try to correct apt-get's problems -- aptitude shell is also less intuitive so look up how to use it ( u, U, g, g, etc.) \nAlso note that if you're using an old version of ubuntu then don't try to fix things with aptitude because apt-get used to not talk very well with it and your system can get messed up if you use both of them.\n\nA: I had the same problem and this solved it for me, after first performing the apt-get clean and lists purge.\nmkdir ~/tmp\nsudo mv /usr/local/lib/libreadline* ~/tmp\nsudo ldconfig\nsudo apt-get update\n\n", "Q: Bumblebee ubuntu 12.04 blender Hi there I used ironhide on 11.10 but in 12.04 I cannot install it because of the ppa (possibly removed) then I installed the bumblebee because blender doesn't working with cuda suport..\nDoes any one know a work around?\nIn ironhide I used optirun32 but in bumblebee that command doesn't exist.\nI installed bumblebee from https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Bumblebee\n\nA: Ironhide is  no longer maintained.\nIn bumblebee its only optirun.

For example\nuser A  got mapped to home folder of user B\nUser B  got mapped to home folder of user C\nUser C  got mapped to home folder of user A\nHow do I change this so that the users get mapped to their correct account.\n\nA: You mixed up the numeric userid's. \nFirst of all check the current configuration: grep -E [0-9]{4}  /etc/passwd You might want to check if the username (1st field) has the correct homedir (6th field).\nIf the passwd file is as expected: Check the output for id for every account and compare it with ls -ln /home.\nProbably the easiest way to change it is as follows:\n\n\n*\n\n*Log off from your desktop\n\n*Strike Alt+F1 and log in\nsudo -i\ncd /home\nchown -R userid2:userid2 userid2\nchown -R userid3:userid3 userid3\n...\n\n*Strike Alt+F2\n\n*Check if you can log in without errors\n\n*Strike Alt+F7\n\n*Check if you can log in to your desktop without problems\n\n\nYou might want to wait with your first user (the one with admin privileges), to make sure if the procedure works as expected.

When I click the commit button, the commit window shows up, but there is a strange situation. Even though I have modified just a few files, the commit window is displaying all the files and directories inside working copy and the checkbox is ticked for each of them, like those files need to be committed. But those files were not changed and already exist in the repo.\nPlease see the image below to understand what I'm saying (the only file that is unversioned/was changed is .htaccess, therefore it should have been the only file listed there).\n\nHas this happened to anyone ? It is a bug with RabbitVCS (and probably a solution exists) or am I doing something wrong ? \n\nA: The most likely explanation is ...\n\n\n*\n\n*Your VCS tracks the executable flag, and you are using a Windows file system on Linux\n\n\nBecause Windows has no exe bit, when you mount a Windows FS in Linux, by default, every file is marked executable. Because the files were not originally checked in as executable, this shows up as a change to the properties on every file.\nYou can counteract this by checking out the working copy to a native Linux file system that supports the executable bit, or by altering the way you are mounting the Windows file system by including the noexec option. Note that this will prevent anything on this file system being run as a program.\n", "Q: How to avoid trying to connect to a stranger's network with known SSID?

Ubuntu tries to connect to it, which of course is futile.\nIs there a way to make Ubuntu understand which SSID it is supposed to be connecting to?\n\nA: Easiest way to do this is the change your SSID so it doesn't interfere. \nNow, I don't know what your router's config looks like, but it should be fairly simple to do.\n\nA: I had the same situation and the solution I came up with was to disable auto-connecting to this wireless network. \nThat is:\n\n\n*\n\n*Click on network manager icon in the top panel.\n\n*Select \"Edit Connections\".\n\n*Go to the \"Wireless\" tab.\n\n*Select the network by it's SSID to configure settings.\nWhat I did was uncheck the \"Connect automatically\" check-box, and it stopped connecting to the wrong network.\nThe drawback is that when the correct network is accessible, you have to connect to it manually.\n\nA: Wireless networks may have the same SSID, but they should not have the same BSSID, so edit the wireless connection and provide the BSSID for the network you do want to autoconnect to.\nRun the following command in a terminal. It will list the SSID and BSSID of all wireless networks in range.\nnmcli -f ssid,bssid dev wifi\n\nClick on the network manager icon in the top panel -> Edit Connections -> Wireless tab -> select the saved connection by its SSID and click Edit.

Kernel 12 and 16 are working fine. But when I try to boot into linux-image-generic 3.0.0.17.20, a red  screen appears and after that, nothing happens.\nI think this is caused by an update. Here's a screenshot of the updates I applied today:\n\nI'm using Ubuntu 11.10 32 bit. I'm dual booting with Windows 7 64 bit.\n\nA: I just had to solve this a few days ago.\nWhen you get to the bootloader (GRUB), and are given the option, pick the one titled \"More kernels\" or something like that.\nThen, once you've done that, pick the one that ends in -12 (or whichever one is lowest) (not recovery).\nAfter that, you should be good to go.\n\nA: I don't know if this will work, but if it was me I would try uninstalling and then re-installing.\nFirst, boot using the linux-image-3.0.0-16-generic kernel as you have been and open a terminal (command) window.\nThen try to completely uninstall the kernel which will not boot for you using   \nsudo apt-get purge linux-image-3.0.0-17-generic\n\nI frankly do not know whether removing the kernel headers makes a difference or not. But since I'm somewhat OCD I would also do   \nsudo apt-get purge linux-headers-3.0.0-17 linux-headers-3.0.0-17-generic\n\nAssuming the above went well I would then try to re-install using  \nsudo apt-get install linux-image-3.0.0-17-generic  \nsudo apt-get install linux-headers-3.0.0-17 linux-headers-3.0.0-17-generic\n\nThe above is just a guess on my part, but since you say 3.0.0.17 is not working for you anyway it might be worth trying.\n\nA: Okay  ! finally I found the problem. The problem does not caused by any updates. The problem was caused by Gparted.\nWhile installing Gparted, never check the ntfsprogs addon. This ugly addon removes a essential program ntfs-3g which gives us the write capability to the windows partitions.\n\nWhile Installing Gparted I checked \"ntfsprogs\" and it replaced ntfs-3g. Thats why I could not boot into linux-image-generic  3.0.0.17.30\n\nNow If you have already messed up your system like me, then open synaptic and Install ntfs-3g. It will automatically remove ntfsprogs and you will be able to boot into image 17 again.\n", "Q: Wireless menu bar item doesn't show up Sometimes when I start my ubuntu system the wireless menu bar item doesn't show up. This makes it impossible for me to connect to a wireless network as I don't know where the wireless menu item is hidden in the GNOME menu tree\nHow do I get my wireless menu item back again without restarting the system and why does this happen?\n\nA: To get the Connection info applet to start if it doesn't on startup, press Alt+F2 and run nm-applet. I'm not too sure why it isn't starting up for you. I would recommend adding the command nm-applet to your startup commands. If this command doesn't work, let me know.\nAlso, to access the actual program without a bar menu item, run this in terminal: nm-connection-editor.\nEdit: This is what I use to start the applet and program in Unity.

As the printing stack is somewhat complex and I'm not really familiar with it, I'd like to know what's the best way to report a printing related bug, as I don't really know which part of the stack is responsible for the issue I'm experiencing. Ideally, I'd like to use ubuntu-bug in order to provide some relevant system information with my bug report, but I don't know which package to specify.\nEdit: I've just filed bug #981586 as to ask for an apport option for filing printing related bugs.\n\nA: Well, the core of the printing system is 'cups', so that's a good place to put printing bugs unless you have something more specific.\nAlso see: https://wiki.ubuntu.com/DebuggingPrintingProblems\nHowever, there are always at least 3 parts to a printing problem; \n1) The application that produces the file/stream to be printed\n  2) The drivers for the particular printer\n  3) The central print queuing stuff\nIf you can figure out which one of these is the cause of your problem then it makes debugging easier, and you might also be able to find a more specific package.\nHowever they can interact (the famous bug where printing from OpenOffice to brother printers on a tuesday is probably the worst case!).\nSo try and split the problem down:\n  a) If you get the application to print to a postscript or PDF files (try both if you have the option) and then look at the resulting postscript or PDF file in a viewer is it right? If it is then you're bug is less likely to be printer specific or even cups.\n  b) Does only that app have a problem?\n  c) Does the problem go away if you use some other options on the printer (e.g. don't use n-up printing or double sided)\nIf you can't print at all then lsusb to see if the printer is seen at all (if USB) is a good bet, as are the CUPS logs.\nDave\n", "Q: superblock errors? fsck /dev/sda\nfsck 1.42.1 (17-Feb-2012)\ne2fsck 1.42.1 (17-Feb-2012)\n/sbin/e2fsck: Superblock invalid, trying backup blocks...\n/sbin/e2fsck: Bad magic number in super-block while trying to open /dev/sda\n\nHi, I had an XP installed for years, never a problem besides those created by Win crap.

As soon as i connect my external monitor, i get garbage on both screens. When i disconnect, the display goes back to normal. \nI think i had kind of similar issues with unity 3D, where i got a message telling me that the resolution for the extended screen exceded the maximum one supported by my hardware. In that case i could choose to lower the resolution, clone the displays, turn of the eeepc's one.

Is there a solution (which doesn't involve dropping gnome shell)? thanks!\n\nA: I have eeepc 1005ha, with intel onboard video.\nI used GNOME3 before last update. Now I can`t switch on it. I do not like Unity on some reasons, and 3d is to slow for my netbook, so I can use only Unity 2d or GNOME Classic.\nOur Netbooks can`t support resolution more than 2048x1024 in normal rendering speed. And second monitor - is like sum of both.\n\nA: I have this same problem on a dual core desktop with intel graphics as well.  I think this problem has to do with running two screen with two different resolutions.  If I clone my monitors all is fine, and if I setup the two monitors with the same resolution things work ok.  My monitors are different sizes, and when I set it to display at the right resolution for each monitor all I get is garbage until I unplug one monitor.  It does it in Unity 3d as well as 2d.

A small application window appears that lets you define new entries in the menu. I bet for Ubuntu there is a simalar way of adding launchers.\n\nA: Yes, you can create the launcher you need.\nFist of all, my Ubuntu is in Spanish, so I will translate some words; I hope you understand me.\n1.- Create a proper script that run the Bricscad script.\nOpen gedit and write this:\n#!/bin/bash\ncd <path_to_Bricscad_script>\nsh .bricscad.sh\n\nSave the file into your personal folder (/home/your_user_name) with the name .run_cad.sh (the fist dot hides the file, only if you want to hide it).\n2.- Create the launcher.\nFor Unity: Press the Super key (that one it usually has the MS Windows logo) and write Main Menu (this is my translation from spanish). So, you will find a program to create launchers. Select a menu, for example Graphics, and then click on the New Item button. Select an aplication type, choose a name, an icon, a comment, and for the command option write sh .run_cad.sh.\n3.- Create a Unity launcher (optional).\nIf you want an icon on the Unity launcher, look for your app using the dash, and then drag it and drop it over the Unity laucher.\nAriel\n", "Q: Where can I find this graphics file from the installer?

I hope fits your needs.\n\n\n\nA: You most likely will not find it on your system. It is included on the live cd (as part of the set of images that are shown during installation). It will be a binary (to save space) so you will need special tools to extract it but the one on the disc is probably going to be 700x470 (so the same size as the image you already found).\nIf you want that as a wallpaper you probaly need to make it yourself (or someone else has to make it ;) ).\n", "Q: Mounting/unmounting TrueCrypt volumes without opening the program I used the advice given at the end of this article\nto mount a TrueCrypt volume by double-clicking it. But I can't unmount it without opening TrueCrypt (umount: /media/truecrypt1 is not in the fstab (and you are not root)) so being able to mount it without opening the program is kind of a moot achievement. Any suggestions?\n\nA: Suggestion One \nYou can use a terminal to unmount it.   \nFor example, I have an encrypted file named enc1 that is on /home/desgua/Dropbox/, so to mount it I should use:  \ntruecrypt --mount /home/desgua/Dropbox/enc1 /mnt/mymountpoint/ \nAnd to unmount:  \ntruecrypt -d /home/desgua/Dropbox/enc1 \nor simple:  \ntruecrypt -d  (which should unmount every truecrypted mounted files)  \n.  \nSuggestion Two \nAlso you can create a launcher to unmount it:  \n1) Paste this at terminal: gedit ~/Desktop/unmounttruecrypt.desktop,  \n2) Then paste this into the file and save:  \n\n[Desktop Entry]\nType=Application\nEncoding=UTF-8\nName=Unmount Truecrypt\nComment=Unmount all mounted Truecrypt files\nExec=gnome-terminal -e \"bash -c \\\"truecrypt -d ; exit; exec bash\\\"\"\nIcon=/usr/share/icons/Humanity/actions/48/player_eject.svg\nCategories=Application;Accessories;\n\n3) Now look at your desktop and drag the file to the Launcher.  \n.  \nSuggestion Three \nMake a script to unmount it for you:  \n1) Paste this at terminal: gedit ~/Desktop/utscript,  \n2) Then paste this into the file and save:  \n\n#!/bin/bash\nmnt=$(mountpoint /mnt/mymountpoint/) # See suggestion One\n\nif [[ $mnt == \"/mnt/mymountpoint/ is a mountpoint\" ]]; then\n\n    truecrypt -d /home/desgua/Dropbox/enc1 | zenity --progress --percentage=40 --auto-close --title=\"Unmounting\" --text=\"I am umounting it now.\"\n    sleep 2 | zenity --progress --percentage=100 --auto-close --title=\"Done!\" --text=\"Done unmounting!\" \n    else\n\n    sleep 2 | zenity --progress --percentage=100 --auto-close --title=\"Already done!\" --text=\"It is unmounted already!\" \n\n    fi\n\nexit 0  \n\n4) Paste this at terminal: chmod +x ~/Desktop/utscript\n\nA: try adding it to the /etc/fstab.

Since I need to plug different external displays into it and Openbox environment doesn't automatically pick them up, I thought the best solution I can come up with is to use gnome-control-center and it's display settings tool from within Openbox. But although this tool does detect monitors correctly, it can't do any change -- clicking Apply button just doesn't seem to do anything.\nSo my questions are: 1) how to get this tool working? 2) how to run \"Displays\" tool directly from command-line, skipping control center? 3) is there a better way to automatically detect and set resolutions on internal/external monitors under Openbox?\nPlease note I tried arandr too and it doesn't even work for my environment (doesn't detect external display plugging in at all).

My question is: Is this some hacked the infos on the aol server or is there a possibility that there is bot malware in my system? If so what should I do?\n\nA: Without an access to the server's logs etc it is not possible to determine the exact cause.\n\n\n*\n\n*Most probably you provided your username and password to another service, and this data has been misused. For example my sister created an account with the badoo server, which asked her for her email credentials \"to easier synchronize her address books\" or something. Then all her contacts got spam from badoo. Don't give your secret data to anybody.\n\n*Or your email account has been hacked. Somebody could have guessed your password, or AOL database was compromised. Use strong passwords and https:// when logging into your account.\n\n*Or your Ubuntu box has been compromised. This is in my opinion the least probable (though not impossible) cause. Reinstall.\n\nA: Since you only use the account from the AOL page, it is very unlikely that it is anything on your computer.  Also, even if someone hacked into your linux system, which is pretty unlikely, it's also pretty unlikely that they would choose to access AOL rather than the many other things they could do.\nWhat is not at all unlikely is that someone simply managed to barge into your AOL account, since AOL has lots of users, and is often used by people who know little about strong passwords, and so is not that hard to get in.  Also, there are a lot of abandoned AOL accounts that can be used for a longer period of time than an active account.\nDo you run any servers that are open to the outside world?

Rarely, but mostly from work, I need to access this server, but I dont want to copy keys on my work laptop - Id rather just use plain password for that.\nSo if I enable password log in from ssh config file, it will ask me password on my laptop too even though it contains keys, right?\nIs there a way to stop this behavior?\nThanks.\n\nA: Use two private keys\nSet up your workstation using the same process (but not the same private key) as you did when you set up your laptop:\n\n\n*\n\n*There is never a good reason to copy a private key from some other machine. If you haven't already generated a fresh private key on your workstation, do so now. Also generate the corresponding public key. In a terminal on your workstation,\n\n\ntype: ssh-keygen -t rsa\n\n\n*\n\n*Copy your workstation's public key to the server. In a terminal on your workstation,\n\n\ntype: ssh-copy-id username@hostname.net\n(but use your actual username and hostname, and later type in your password when it asks for it).\nThis installs the public key of your workstation into the ~/.ssh/authorized_keys file for that user on the server.\n\n\n*\n\n*There is no step 3. From now on, you can log into the server from your workstation, and you never copied your laptop's secret private key from your laptop.\n\n\ndetails\nI assume that what you are really asking is\n\n\n*\n\n*I have an Ubuntu server (\"home\")\n\n*I log in to my Ubuntu server from my personal laptop (\"laptop\")\n\n*I also log in to my Ubuntu server from my work computer (\"workstation\").\n\n\nWhat is the right way to do that?\n\n\n*\n\n*I suppose I could simply log in with the same password from both places. That can't be the right way, because everyone says that public key authentication is much better than passwords. (a)\n\n*I suppose I could simply copy the private key from my laptop to my workstation. That can't be the right way, because everyone says that the private key is never supposed to leave the client machine.\n\n\nPeople have it hammered into their head that one account on a server has a single username and, of course, a single authorized password.\nPublic-key systems like ssh are better than the password system:\nOne account on a server has a single username and any number of authorized public keys, all of them listed in the ~/.ssh/authorized_keys file.\n(more details).\n\nA: No, at least with the configuration I have if you enable password authentication it will only prompt for the password if you do not have a key.\nThat being said -- I would never enable password authentication on a server exposed to the Internet.\n\nA: It is possible to force your laptop to use the keyfile even if both the password and keybased approach are available. If you're currently connecting with ssh user@your.host.tld -p 22, edit ~/.ssh/config and add:\nHost your.host.tld\n    PreferredAuthentications publickey\n\nThis configuration file can be used to make you type even less:\nHost home\n    Hostname your.host.tld\n    User user\n    PreferredAuthentications publickey\n    Port 22\n\nWith that configuration, you just need ssh home.\nIt's possible to restrict password-based logins to a certain IP address. In /etc/ssh/sshd_config, you'd have a line that disabled password-based auth: PasswordAuthentication no. To enable it for logins from a certain IP, you could use:\nMatch Address 12.34.56.78\n    PasswordAuthentication yes\n\nI suggest you to use keybased auth even if on work. It's much safer than password-based auth as it cannot be bruteforced that easily. You can have multiple keys for the same account, that should not be an issue.\nFor more fancy configuration directives, see the manual page of ssh_config(5).

Is this because of the different file system that Linux uses? Is this normal?\n\nA: The smallest amount of space which can be allocated on disk is called a \"sector\" - historically it's been 512 bytes, but newer hard disks have larger sectors of 4096 bytes (though I'm not sure if \"logical sectors\" are 4096 bytes too or they're still 512 bytes).\nSo if you have a file just 1 byte in size, it will still occupy 512 bytes on disk.\nMost files are far larger than a few bytes, so the difference is usually just a few percent. I'm not sure if you have hundreds of millions of tiny files in your Downloads folder, but that would explain this behavior.\n\nA: This is probably due to a lot of small files, every file takes at least the space of 1 block or sector.\nThe other way around is also possible, with sparse files. You can have a file with a size of several gigabytes, only taking a couple of kilobytes in disk (ls -lh and du -sh on the file will show this difference). A large string of 0-bytes is not stored on the disk, but is stored as meta data (\"byte X til X + 10013434 are 0\").\n", "Q: How do I compile a Wikipedia lens and install?

I changed permission on /var/www/ to 777 for the moment, because I want to host my simple website or webpage but only on my local server.\nTHANK YOU this is my first server and I guess YOU got the point. If possible step by step.\n\nA: You need to do 2 things:\n\n\n*\n\n*configure nameservers (probably in some control panel of the registrar from which you bought the domain) to point the A record to the (static) IP address of your router (i.e. its external address) - I hope by \"I changed my IP address to static\" you mean that you contacted your ISP and requested a static IP address from them, not that you configured your machine's local IP to be static (though the latter is needed too)\n\n*Secondly, you go to your router's configuration page (see your router instructions, usually it's something like http://10.0.0.1:8080/) and configure Port Forwarding - i.e. you need to tell your router to take all requests which come to its external interface on port 80 and redirect them into internal network to the IP of your server, then take the response and send it back as if it was generated by the router. So for external world the responses will be coming from the external IP of the router. To which IP your DNS records point to. Easy-peasy.\nAlso, some ISPs, to protect users, block all incoming connections to the client's IPs or only to some common ports. So the access from outside may not work even if everything is configured correctly. You will need to check with your ISP to figure out how to remove port blocking.\nThere's no need to change anything in your Ubuntu settings, no need to change permissions on /var/www or anything... as such, it may be beneficial for you if this question was migrated to serverdefault. \n\nA: First, you will need to make sure you configure port forwarding on your router so that when someone tries to access the IP address of your router, it will be redirected to your server. At that point, anyone could type in your ip address (the external one when you type \"what is my ip\" into google, not the internal one on your LAN) and it should pull up your web site.\nNext you need to match your domain name to that IP address. You would do this through GoDaddy or whatever registrar you used.\n", "Q: My ati Radeon X1200 graphic card is not installed how do i install it I am new to ubuntu i have a toshiba satellite A215 laptop with a ati Radeon X1200 graphic card. When ubuntu 12.04 has finished installed, i check the detail menu in system settings the graphic option is displaying,driver known experience standard. I'm then assuming that the graphic card is not installed how can i install it if thats the case.\n\nA: The wording of that dialog may be confusing you.  You do have a video driver installed by default - an open source driver named 'radeon' (also sometimes referred to as the -ati driver.)\nThe other driver that's being offered is a proprietary closed-source driver called AMD Catalyst, aka \"fglrx\" which stands for \"FireGL and Radeon for X\".  Like others have mentioned it only works for newer AMD cards, and unfortunately your X1200 (of the R6xx generation) is no longer supported by AMD with this driver.  -fglrx is needed for getting the maximum performance and full feature support out of AMD graphics cards.\nHowever, contrary to what others have said, the open source -ati driver is fine for ordinary computer use - which is presumably what you're after since you're using a somewhat older graphics card.  It's quite stable, with reasonable performance good enough for basic gaming, desktop compositing and so on.  Plus then you can have a warm fuzzy feeling that you're using open source rather than closed source.  ;-)\n\nA: I have Precise 12.4...won't take ATI/AMD Prop...but I have dual monitors in Precise 12.4 (“OneWideScreen”).  Here is what I had to do:\nBoot to the \"Recovery Mode.\"  You'll see the Menu, (Resume... Network, etc.)\nScroll down to \"Network\" ENTER\n-you should then get back to the menu, but if not, hit Ctr-d\nScroll to \"Drop to Root...\"  Enter the following commands:\n$ rm xorg.conf\n$ apt-get install FGLRX (Ubuntu Supported Binary driver -ATI-base)\n$ reboot\nReboot to full graphics  mode.\nOnce both screens are live go to \"Settings\" and click on \"Display\"\nYou see both of your displays.  \nClick \"ON\" for each.  Two (2) things to note:\n 1.  Check the resolution for each one.  Normally you'll want this to be the same setting for each monitor.  However I have a 1920x1200 (\"24\" DIV) and a 1920x1080 (23\" HDMI) so I have each monitor configured to its maximum resolution.  Be careful, however, with that setup as when you drag a folder/file from the larger screen to the lessor it can get \"stuck\" (bothersome...but if so, just double click to get it back).\n 2. I chose my Left (Acer) Monitor for my \"Launcher Placement.\"  This gives a full wide screen display and the icons only show on the far left (Acer)  I'll post a pic (if I can) at my login...\n\nA: Just open the Dash (Ubuntu logo on top left), and type 'driver'.  Open the additional drivers program.\nYou'll see a proprietary ATI driver in this list.  Select it and click activate.  That is all.\nIf for some reason this does not work, go to the terminal and do;\nsudo apt-get install fglrx\n\nThen, reboot.\nYou win!\n\nA: Radeon X1200 proprietary drivers are not supported anymore. And it doesn't fit to new graphical server. So basically, all you can use is… opensource drivers, which is far from prefect at the moment.\n", "Q: how to rename and move files according to directory names? I have bunch of directories containing the file with the same name. I want to move these files to another directory and at the same time renaming them with the directory name so that they are distinguished and are not over-written.\nEDIT:\nAll the directories are in the same directory. Destination is one directory on the system which could be anything. We read directory and read file form it and rename it exactly as the directory name and put it to the destination.\nAn important constraint is that the name of the file is given which will be in all of the directories. Directories might contain other files bit also the one which is given\nThanks a lot\n\nA: Assuming the filename of these files are thefilename, you've cded to the directory containing these directories, and you want to move them to /path/to/dest, the following shell loop should do the trick\nfor file in */thefilename; do\n    echo mv -iv \"./$file\" \"/path/to/dest/${file%/*}\"\ndone\n\nYou can run that directly in an interactive shell, or put it in a file and run it as a script.\nI added an echo to make it only print the mv commands. If the output looks correct, remove the echo and run it again to have it actually do the moving.\n\nA: If you use bash, you can do the following:\n$ for i in *WhatEverMatchesYourOriginalDirectories*\ndo\n  cd $i\n  for j in *\n  do\n    mv $j ../Target/${i}-${j}\n  done\n  cd ..\ndone\n\nThis will move every file in the directories matched by the first wildcard into the Target directory.\n", "Q: Can I resolve user issues by cleaning out my home folder? \nPossible Duplicate:\nHow do I reset GNOME to the defaults? \n\nYesterday I had an issue with my 12.04 - https://askubuntu.com/questions/121957/12-04-does-anyone-know-how-to-fix-this-all-of-a-sudden-my-terminal-shortcut-d#comment145297_121957\nand some configuration causing an issue with metacity making it crash - I was walked through the problem, and found out that by creating another user account and logging onto it - the problem wasn't present anymore on that account but still was present on my old account.\nSo my question is - was the problem just something in my old Home folder? - also - can most issues that occur like this be solved by making a new account and backing up the \"Home\" folder?\n\nA: Your issue was found to be limited to a corrupt configuration file in your home as the new user account did not have the issue you were facing. It doesn't happen all the time. Problems might be from the software level (in other words, a bug in the software) which can't be fixed by creating a new user account. \nIt clearly is a problem with just the home folder (or more exactly, the configuration files) because the newer accounts are not affected. \nYou could have possibly fixed your problem by resetting your gnome-session to the defaults but it didn't strike me when I was trying to fix your problem. Try resetting GNOME to the defaults and see if that fixes the problem with your old user account. \n", "Q: Switching to an external display, when primary is broken I've successfully install Ubuntu 11.10 Desktop (x86) on an old(er) laptop that unfortunately has a broken screen, so there is an external monitor plugged in.

Normally that would be a good thing, but caused it to not recognize any other monitor and basically fail.\nI reinstalled completely, unchecked the third-party applications, and finally after adding nomodeset to the grub boot I was able to get to the desktop.\nThere were several options in the restricted drivers I could install and noticed some old series that might work for the card that on that machine, so if I'm feeling masochistic I might try and install those and see what happens.\n", "Q: 'tools.jar' is not in IDEA classpath I am a new user of Linux, it has been recommended to me by my friend.\nHe told me to install software called IntelliJ Idea IDE.\nWell I have been following the tutorial.

Recently, I've been backing up a lot of my data, and I noticed that I can save files as .gz or .tar.gz, or .7z and .tar.7z, etcetera. What are the differences between the normal one and the .tar.* variant? Which one of them is adviced when making backups?\n\nA: its different styles of compression , tar by itself is simply archived(little to no compression). tar.gz is a tar archive but the contents are compressed by gzip(moderate compression) hence the .gz and tar.7z is compressed using 7zip (usually super high compression)\nwhen backing up I would recommend tar.7z as it has the highest compression rate saving you space but uses an extra program (7zip). .tar.gz will be larger files and do the same job, you could also use bzip (.tar.bz/bz2) although i'm not sure if that would suit you better as I use gzip or 7zip\n\nA: It depends on what you are looking for... Compression or archiving?\nWhen I talk about archiving, I mean preserving permissions, directory structure, etc...\nCompression may ignore most of that and just get your files in a smaller packages.\nTo preserve file permissions, use tar:\ntar cpvf backup.tar folder\n\nThe p flag will save file permissions.\nUse the z flag for gzip compression or the j flag for bzip compression.\ntar czpvf backup.tar.gz folder #backup.tgz is acceptable as well\ntar cjpvf backup.tar.bz2 folder #backup.tbz2 works too\n\nIf you want to have a tar file you can \"update\" package the tar using the P flag:\ntar cpPvf backup.tar folder\n\nThen to update, replace 'c' with 'u' and when unpacking, you can use 'k' to preserve files that already exist.\ntar upPvf backup.tar folder #updating a tar file\ntar xpPkvf backup.tar #extracting a tar with permissions(p) and not extracting(k) files that exist on disk already\n\nThe P flag saves files with full paths, so - /home/username vs home/username (notice the leading forward slash).\n7z compression offers greater compression, but does not preserve file ownership, permissions, etc. Rzip is another compression utility that offers comparable compression with 7z as well.\nI guess a backup.tar.7z file is just a tar file (with permissions) compressed by a 7z file, though I wouldn't be surprised if little compression occurred because 7z may not be able to dump the file metadata. It's 7z's ability to exclude the file metadata that it can offer great compression (amongst other things of course).\nCompression depends entirely on data type as well. Some files don't compress well because they may already be compressed with some other means (ie, .mp3, .jpg, .tiff/with lzma, .rpm, etc).\n\nA: typically, *.tar files are just tar files created by tar program, *.gz programs are created by gzip, *.tar.gz (sometime also *.tgz) are gziped tar files, and *.7z are created by 7zip.\nHowever, in Linux/Unix, one can name a file pretty much anyway he wants, so it is completely at the discretion of the creator of the files.\n\nA: Tar (Tape Archiver) has traditionally been used as a container in Unix/Linux to package files for movement.  It packages the file structure and maintains file attributes, but it doesn't compress the files.\nCompression programs compress the file to make it smaller, but they may not handle multiple files, and/or they may not handle the file attributes neccesssary for Linux.  Since tar already exists and is well-supported, there's no reason for archiving programs to duplicate this functionality, which is platform-specific (re, different for Windows and Linux).  Also, different compression programs may perform differently on different types of files, so having a choice of more than one is desirable.\n\nA: If you come from a Windows background, you may be familiar with the zip and rar formats. These are archives of multiple files compressed together.\nIn Unix and Unix-like systems (like Ubuntu), archiving and compression are separate.\n\n*\n\n*tar puts multiple files into a single (tar) file.\n\n*gzip compresses one file (only).\n\nSo, to get a compressed archive, you combine the two, first use tar or pax to get all files into a single file (archive.tar), then gzip it (archive.tar.gz).\nIf you have only one file, you need to compress (notes.txt): there's no need for tar, so you just do gzip notes.txt which will result in notes.txt.gz. There are other types of compression, such as compress, bzip2 and xz which work in the same manner as gzip (apart from using different types of compression of course).\n\nA: gzip or bzip2 doesn't know about file system - file name, directory, or tree structure. It just compresses input stream, then output result. Even gzip or bzip2 can't archive directories on their own, that is why it is usually combined with tar.\ntar(archiver) - just archive file structure.\ngzip,bzip2(compressor) - just compress input.\nI think this strategy came from 'do one thing well' Unix philosophy. Tar works well? Leave it as is. Need more compression ratio than gzip? Here is bzip2 or 7zip.\n\nA: Other answers have explained the difference between compression and archiving well.\n7z is an archiver, which means it knows about the internal directory structure, file names, etc. without having to decompress everything. However, there are some limitations. I quote from man 7z on my Ubuntu system:\nBackup and limitations\n       DO NOT USE the 7-zip format for backup purpose on Linux/Unix because :\n        - 7-zip does not store the owner/group of the file.\n\n       On Linux/Unix, in order to backup directories you must use tar :\n        - to backup a directory  : tar cf - directory | 7za a -si directory.tar.7z\n        - to restore your backup : 7za x -so directory.tar.7z | tar xf -\n\n       If you want to send files and directories (not the owner of file) to others Unix/MacOS/Windows users, you can use the 7-zip format.\n\n         example : 7za a directory.7z  directory\n\n       Do not use \"-r\" because this flag does not do what you think.\n\n       Do not use directory/* because of \".*\" files (example : \"directory/*\" does not match \"directory/.profile\")\n\nThere you have it. One can use tar inside 7z (resulting in directory.tar.7z) to make sure you have preserved all the special Linux goodies. However, 7z will only know about the one tar file inside, and the entire tar file will have to be unpacked and read to discover what lies inside. Therefore, for a bunch of regular files, and where ownership doesn't matter, just use 7z directly.\nAlso, if a tar file (or a compressed tar.anything file) is damaged, you will only be able to recover your data up to the point of injury. With an archive like 7z (not using tar inside) your chances of recovering more files are better.\nPS: 7z can also create solid archives, which result in better compression, but comes with the same limitations as using tar inside any compressor.

It works initially, then after a while the stuttering kicks in. Hopefully someone can fix this - although I'm curious as to how you can bypass the pulse audio server to get sound (I'm just using a laptop without network audio needs). \n(I have Flash 11.2 r202 on Firefox Kubuntu 12.04 amd64)\n\nA: Preface\nI was able to replicate Dave's issue in experiments, and they lead me to believe that Flash is somehow sending the sound to PulseAudio in such a way that it creates a lot of network traffic (think lots of tiny packets, not bandwidth); this overwhelms the network \"tunnel\" PulseAudio has created, i.e. you have\nYoutube => [PA-client => network => PA-server] => speakers\n\nI could solve the issue by putting both the client and server on their own virtual network, giving them effectively infinitely fast connectivity (10 Gbits/sec) between them; obviously, that doesn't work for real-world networks :)\nSo, a bit of googling and this post and this one gave me the idea of dropping the tunnel (middleman, as Dave aptly put it), and having the client talk directly to the server, i.e.\nYoutube => network => PA-server => speakers\n\nAnd that worked for me; Flash videos/sound play flawlessly.\nLet's try it!\nThis assumes your client-server are on a local network (router, etc.)\n\n\n*\n\n*Preliminary: On the client machine, if you have an existing setup, open paprefs and uncheck everything; then kill PulseAudio to be sure.\n\n*On the server machine (i.e., the one with the speakers), start PA Preferences (paprefs) and set it up as follows:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n*\n\n*Then close it, and kill PulseAudio in a terminal as shown, wait, and check that it is now listening on port 4713:\n\n\n\n\n\n*\n\n*If you don't see it, open paprefs again and check the remaining boxes in the Network Access and Network Server tabs (they don't hurt)\n\n*Make sure you know the server's IP address - use ifconfig, etc. We'll use 192.168.0.4 in our example.\n\n\n*On the client machine, open a terminal, and test our direct connection first, with a speech sample WAV (replace 192.168... with your server IP!)\n\nwget http://www.signalogic.com/melp/EngSamples/Orig/female.wav\npaplay --server=192.168.0.4:4713 female.wav\n\n\n\n*\n\n*Abort with Ctrl-C if it works, it can get boring ;)\n\n\n\nNow, close all running browser instances, and then start it (assuming Firefox here with the following syntax):\nPULSE_SERVER=192.168.0.4:4713 firefox &\n\n\n\n*\n\n*Replace 192... with the appropriate IP for your server!\n\n*In that Firefox instance, open up Youtube (or whichever Flash video site), and try playing videos back --- fingers crossed, it should work without stuttering/pausing!\nMake it stick\nIf you want to make this fix apply to all programs instead of having to put PULSE_SERVER=192.168.0.4:4713 in front of every command, edit /etc/environment on the client and add PULSE_SERVER=192.168.0.4:4713 on a new line at the end of the file. Also add a line break at the end.\nThis will make all sound on the client go to the Pulseaudio server, so be sure that's what you want before making this edit to your /etc/environment file.\nReboot, and enjoy a smooooooth audio experience. ;)\n\nA: You need to have these plugins on firefox to flawlessly run any media. Check which one you have and which you have not.\n\nThe profile should be this:\n\n\nA: I have the same problem and have not yet found a perfect solution to the problem. I have noticed some things that might help you:\n1) It happens for me with flash, but also sometimes with the html5 version of youtube. Does this also happen for you? (http://www.youtube.com/html5/ you can enable html5 version of youtube here). This suggests that the problem is not exclusive to flash (but maybe somehow browsers?)\n2) I can get the sound working properly like you without going to the server by using pavucontrol by setting the output device to the local device and then back to remote server. This solves the stuttering of audio and random pauses and skips of video. This alas only works until the next video starts.\n3) I am pretty sure that while googling this problem I ran across some people saying that the problem was related to the clock counters of the client and the server not being linked up properly and that is what is reset by restarting server or reconnecting with the client (ie. point 2). I'll try to dig that out for you.\nI couldn't find the promised discussion, but I did find some background information on the timer based scheduling:\nhttp://0pointer.de/blog/projects/pulse-glitch-free.html\n\nA: I'm really glad that I have found this page finally. \nI've had this problem since many versions of Ubuntu (it started to get nasty when padevchooser was abandoned) and now with Arch. The solution to set & export the environment variable PULSE_SERVER before starting the browser  has always worked good for me. It is not necessary to change anything on the server.\nBut there's one thing I do not understand: When I start my browser (Chromium) from a terminal inside the desktop environment, the sound works. When I start the browser from a launcher (Xfce, Gnome, ...) like it should be normally, the problems described above are there. I think that has got something to do with X11 environment variables, but this is beyond my skills. \nFor me I solved the problem now by editing my chromium.desktop file and adding the Pulse-Server there:\nExec=sh -c \"PULSE_SERVER=mice.local chromium %U\"\n\nA: I found a solution to fix stuttering while using module-tunnel-sink.\nAll you have to do is download Flash Player version 10.3 (which also have hardware acceleration support, Adobe dropped it in version 11).\nHere's the x86_64 binary\nTo install it extract libflashplayer.so library to ~/.mozilla/plugins directory or change current link using update-alternatives.\nPlease be aware that 10.3 version have many security vulnerabilities, so you use it at your own risk.\n", "Q: Reliable way to create secure tunnels from startup on an ubuntu laptop? I'm looking for a reliable way to start a secure tunnel at boot on a laptop.\nThis tunnel will not be needed by other parts of the boot process, but could be needed at any subsequent time by a user.  It should \"just work\", the user should not have to monitor and fix it.\nThe secure tunnel will \"pull in a port\" from a insecure application bound to localhost (in this case, a redis database) on a remote server to the ubuntu laptop.  \nExample:  \nremote server:  example.net \nremote port to forward:  6379, bound only to localhost from example.net \nremote user: mole@example.net \nkeyfile:  mole@example.net has authorized a ssh keypair with no passphrase, one key is stored in authorized_keys on the server and the other in /root/moleKey.rsa on the laptop\nThis works inside a terminal window on the laptop:\n$ sudo su\n...\n# ssh -i /root/moleKey.rsa -L 16379:localhost:6379 mole@example.net -N &\n# exit\n$ telnet localhost 16379\n(works fine)\n^C\n\nSo then I tried putting \nssh -i /root/moleKey.rsa -L 16379:localhost:6379 mole@example.net -N &\n\ninto /etc/rc.local\nBut that doesn't work reliably, the ssh process was gone when the tunnel was needed and I can't find any error lines for it in syslog or messages\nIs there a more reliable way to start the secure tunnel at boot-up, or perhaps a manager that will restart the secure tunnel as needed?\n\nA: For ubuntu 11.10+, the package \"gstm\" does OK at providing an easier way to set up the tunnel.  \nsee\nhttp://web.archive.org/web/20150318153045/http://linuxers.org/article/manage-your-ssh-tunnel-redirects-graphically-using-gnome-ssh-tunnel-manager (original link now dead)\n\nA: I was having the same issues with /etc/rc.local not being persistent through reboots \nUpstart is a good solution and this works for me:\n# location: /etc/init/tunnel.conf \ndescription \"persistent ssh tunnel through reboots\"\nauthor \"morgan mcdaris <morganmcdaris@gmail.com>\"\n\nstart on (local-filesystems and net-device-up IFACE=eth0)\nstop on runlevel [016]\n\nrespawn\nrespawn limit 5 60\n\nscript\n  exec su LOCAL_USERNAME -c \"ssh -N -R 4040:localhost:22 -i /home/LOCAL_USERNAME/.ssh/id_rsa REMOTE_USERNAME@REMOTE_MACHINE_IP\"\nend script\n\npost-start script\n   PID=`status tunnel | egrep -oi '([0-9]+)$' | head -n1`\n   echo $PID > /var/run/tunnel.pid\nend script\n\npost-stop script\n    rm -f /var/run/tunnel.pid\nend script\n\nyou need to enter your values for:\nLOCAL_USERNAME\nREMOTE_USERNAME\nREMOTE_MACHINE_IP\nafter that you can start it up by rebooting or:\n$ sudo start tunnel\n\nthe post-start scripts give a pid file if you want to do some monit stuff\n", "Q: Windows broke my md RAID. (Unknown RAID level -1000000) I did something very stupid today. Now I'm just hoping to find someone who is even more smart than I am stupid. \nI have a couple of hot swappable disks. Since I'm going to screencast Ubuntu 12.04LTS next week, I thought I'd install a fresh copy on an empty disk. I thought I'd see if I could do that using VirtualBox, so that I could just reboot the host to that disk when it was finished and setup completely. So I created a VMDK that pointed to that disk with raw access. Worked great. \nThen I thought, I might as well test with windows first, because that would allow me to screencast how to install Ubuntu from a running Windows machine. Install went fine. I then rebooted to it, but Windows crashed. I weren't too surprised by that, though. I didn't really expect that to work in the first place. But it asked if it should fix the startup problems for me. Yes please. It told me everything was now fine, and I could reboot. Windows still didn't boot, so I gave up on that project and rebooted to Ubuntu. \nUnknown RAID level -1000000, Grub says now. I can't boot from my main disks. But I have Ubuntu on my keyring of course, so I booted from that. Installed mdadm and run mdadm --assemble --scan. It then tells me \nubuntu@ubuntu:~$ sudo mdadm --assemble --scan\nmdadm: Devices UUID-00000000:00000000:00000000:00000000 and UUID-c00b1e54:78802534:df92b1b7:9e64ccd8 have the same name: /dev/md1\nmdadm: Duplicate MD device names in conf file were found.\n\nThat's worse; I can't activate the RAID. This is 1.8TB of data, so I really would rather not restore from backup. As you can imagine, all inputs are valuable to me now. More information about the setup. \nI have three disks 1.5TB each. The first partition on all of them is a RAID 1. This is used for boot. They also have a second partition which is used for a RAID5. This RAID5 is used for LVM. \nNow, palimpsest detects the partitions properly. So I'm not in total despair yet. It seems unlikely that Windows will have damaged the second partition, hundreds of megabytes into the disk? My assumption is that it's only damaged something at the beginning. Then the question becomes how do I fix it? \nI've also run \n\nubuntu@ubuntu:~$ sudo mdadm --examine --scan\nARRAY /dev/md1 UUID=00000000:00000000:00000000:00000000\n   spares=2\nARRAY /dev/md0 UUID=37bc1971:5b00e915:2f3fc100:0972a2ae\nARRAY /dev/md1 UUID=c00b1e54:78802534:df92b1b7:9e64ccd8\n\nIt doesn't look entirely hopeless, but I'm a little bit stuck. Geniuses, where are you! :)\n\nA: It's not the partitions that were damaged, it was your metadata. Having the conf file around is nice because it tells you which UUIDs really matter to the original install. So your task is to preserve those UUIDs and delete the other ones, and then cross your fingers and pray that your data wasn't corrupted in addition to the metadata mess up.\nLook in man mdadm for metadata manipulation switches.\nAs a side note, this is where HW RAIDs have value, when using multiple operating systems, the HW RAIDs metadata is never exposed to the host, they get a \"new disk\", not a disk that has a partition with some metadata on it. So what you just encountered can't happen.\nGood luck, if you really get stuck you might want to join the MD mailing list and for help there. http://marc.info/?l=linux-raid&r=1&b=201204&w=2\n", "Q: cdrom mounting issues This is my very first boot on ubuntu and I noticed the system did not open, pop up anything when I inserted a DVD.

Without keydown it just switches back and forth between two windows, with keydown it behaves like I want (displaying the alt-tab switcher) but the alt key is stuck.  Is there a way to unstick the key after using the alt tab switcher using xdotools?\n\nA: Alternative which works for me.\n3-finger swipe right:\nxdotool keydown 0xffea + key 0xff09\n\nExplanation:\n▪It simple holds ALT and presses TAB at same time.\n▪This allows access the menu.\n▪Once you select from menu you have to to release the holded ALT key by performing 3-finger swipt left operation.\n\n3-finger swipe left:\nxdotool keyup 0xffea\n\nExplanation:\n▪ It simple releases the ALT key.\n\n0xffea is value of ALT key. \n0xff09 is value of TAB key.\nPlease note that both commands must be executed, otherwise the system gets stuck.

Why can't the people who design themes on DeviantArt turn those into code and let users download those themes themselves, even if the developers at Rhythmbox won't accept different themes?\n\nA: In open source projects, why do software patches have to be accepted by a developer?\n\nThis is because distros contain only one version of one piece of software. If your patch is accepted by the developer, he/she will release it which will make it's way to the end user. \nCouldn't contributors just release their own patches and allow people to \nadd the patch if they choose to\n\nIt is possible, but in this case the people need to understand how to apply patches. It is usually a very tricky and geeky way to apply code patches. The user needs to get the source code of the software, apply patch, build it and install it. Most of the non-techie users just install the already built software. Most of them won't go through the hassles of patching their software.\nFor instance, lots of people want Rhythmbox to be more attractive. \nWhy can't the people who design themes on DeviantArt turn those into \ncode and let users download those themes themselves, even if the developers \nat Rhythmbox won't accept different themes?\n\nYou are talking mostly about themes. Many softwares have plugin system which allow the application behavior to be tweaked to suit the user's need. A plugin can make Rhythmbox looks more attractive. Not all the aspects of the application can be tweaked. Only those aspects of an application can be tweaked this way (plugins/themes) which are explicitly supported by the application developer.\n\nA: You don't have to wait on the developers to accept a patch.\nJust download the program's source code, apply whatever patch you have or found, and compile it.\nFor example, GNU Screen didn't support vertical splits for a long time, so many people downloaded Screen and applied somebody else's patch to add vertical-split support.\n", "Q: Brightness keys adjust brightness too many times Every time I hit a brightness key on my laptop's keyboard, it adjusts the brightness by three steps instead of one.

I'm having an issue: I'd like the screen to lock automatically (when video is not playing, of course) but do not want the screen to turn off automatically, because that kills audio. I can manually lock the screen, of course, but it appears that if you set the \"Turn off screen\" setting to \"never\", the screen will never lock, no matter what the \"lock screen\" timeout is set to.\nIs there a way to do what I'm asking, or will I have to install xscreensaver?\n\nA: xscreensaver would be simpler\nIt would be nice for HDMI audio to stay active, wouldn't it...\nI don't think there is a way to disable screensaver while video is playing with ubuntu settings. Some players have this setting built in.\nI've been playing around with \nxset dpms force standby\n\nIt does not work with ATI cards but what does :( \nYou can check more settings with xset -h\nTry this, it should work.

But I cannot do this as if I shrink C drive, the unallocated 20 GB is cannot be added to either / or /home. For more info I am telling that 4 drives are extended partition and the rest is primary. So how to extend this partition?\nScreenshot of Windows 7 Disk Management - http://img12.imageshack.us/img12/5977/snap1sv.jpg\n\n\nA: I have done this many times and the best way is to either boot Ubuntu from live CD or from HDD.\nthen make sure everything needed is install.\nsudo apt-get install gparted ntfsprogs \n\n\nOpen Gparted , make sure C: is unmounted.\nclick and select resize , then apply.\nafter doing this you will need to be on a Live CD.\nto resize your / & /home partitions  \n\nA: Boot from Ubuntu LiveCD and use GParted to resize your C: partition, then move the C: partition farther by 10Gb - this will create a 10Gb hole after your / partition. Resize your / partition to use that space. \nThen move the origin of the extended partition to use the unallocated 10Gb after the C: partition, and move the logical partitions inside the extended partition one by one so the empty space is at the end of the extended partition. Resize the extended partition shrinking its size by 10 Gb. \nThen resize the /home partition.\nTL;DR: Boot from Ubuntu LiveCD; move partitions one by one. :) (also I'm not sure I correctly understood which partition is which)\nAs jippie pointed out, make sure you have backups!\nAlso, moving the origin of any bootable partitions will require re-configuring the boot-loader, GParted warns about this and gives an URL to a page with detailed instructions\n", "Q: How do I modify or disable the HUD's use of the Alt key? A number of games, Emacs, and the terminal make extensive use of the Alt key. Can Unity be configured to respect this key, rather than launching the HUD with it?\n\nA: You can use compizconfig-settings-manager  to change the key used to show the HUD.\nTo install it, run the following command in a terminal:\nsudo apt-get install compizconfig-settings-manager\n\n\n\n*\n\n*What are some of the issues with CCSM and why would I want to avoid it?\nAfter installing it, open it (ccsm) and go to Ubuntu Unity Plugin.\n\nClick on the button for the option Key to show the HUD and a dialog similar to the one shown below will appear.\n\nClick on Grab key combination and press your desired new key combination and press enter. After that, click on OK button and the new key combination will trigger the HUD from now on.\n\nA: Open the System Settings application either by going to Session Indicator in Unity panel, or by searching for System Settings using the HUD.\n\nThen go to Keyboard > Shortcuts > Launchers.  You can redefine the HUD key with the Key to show the HUD option. Pressing Backspace will disable the HUD shortcut altogether.\n\nIf you set it to Alt manually, the setting distinguishes between the left and right Alt key.  So if you want to maintain general behaviour and still use Alt combinations, this may be an alternate solution for you.\n\nA: You can configure HUD with help of gsettings:\n\nDESCRIPTION\n       gsettings offers a simple commandline interface to GSettings.It lets you get, set or monitor an individual key for changes.\n\n\n\n*\n\n*To get current key run following command in terminal:\n$ gsettings get org.compiz.integrated show-hud\n['<Alt>']\n\n\n*To change key (let Alt+Super) run following command in terminal:\ngsettings set org.compiz.integrated show-hud \"['<Alt><Super>']\"\n\nNow when you press only Alt then HUD not shown. But it is configured to shown by Alt+Super!\nYou can set valid Key-Combination instead of \"['<Alt><Super>']\".\n\nA: On \"Ubuntu 13.04 (raring)\" you can execute:\ndisable HUD:\ndconf write /org/compiz/integrated/show-hud '[\"\"]'\n\nenable/reset HUD ('Alt L'):\ndconf write /org/compiz/integrated/show-hud '[\"&lt;Alt&gt;\"]'\n\n\nA: Well it's Called HUD. The new feature of Unity.\nTo prevent it from appearing, you can disable its key binding in keyboard shortcuts.\nOpen system settings by going to Session Indicator in Unity panel.\n\nIn system settings select Keyboard. Under Shortcuts tab, Click on `Key to show the HUD. and press Backspace to disable it. That's it!\n\n\nA: In Ubuntu 12.04 I changed shortcut for summoning HUD in System Settings... > Keyboard > Shortcuts > Launchers > Key to show the HUD.\nNow my left Alt is happy again :-)\n\nA: In the system settings, just change the keyboard shortcut for \"Key to show the HUD\" (under 'Launchers'). As a suggestion, set it to activate when both the alt keys are pressed at the same time, instead of just one.

You need the kernel headers for your current kernel installed or it will fail to build the modules needed, resulting in this error.\n\nA: This is so easy. I had the same problem and I was wondered how easy to solve this is. Make sure to close VirtualBox first, completly. Then issue the following command:  \nsudo vboxreload\n\nThat's it!

The addon to the command to enable DnD doesn't make for the best launch command, ie. your program will be looking for the file to open.\nWhat works a lot of the time is to add Z:%f to the end of the Exec= command, so using yours \nExec=env WINEPREFIX=\"/home/nastys/.mso2010\" wine \"C:/Program Files/Microsoft Office/Office14/WINWORD.exe\" Z:%f\n\nI don't think the d. quotes on your wine command are an issue here with DnD, if so then use \\\\\\\\ for folders, & \\\\ for spaces, like  - \nExec=env WINEPREFIX=\"/home/nastys/.mso2010\" wine C:\\\\\\\\Program\\\\ Files\\\\\\\\Microsoft\\\\ Office\\\\\\\\Office14\\\\\\\\WINWORD.exe Z:%f\n\nThis could give you DnD on the icon but produce complaining/error as a launcher. Not much to do there. \nWhat you could do if the DnD works is just use the icon for DnD, (don't left click on) & then add a quicklist to your .desktop to  launch Word itself when desired.\nI do use the Z:%f on other progs for Dnd & tested here with notepad where it worked fine.\n\nA: You can do this:  \n1) Download the Microsoft Word Icon (example: from here)  \n2) Put it in a convenient folder (example: /home/<user>/Icons/)  \n3) Edit the .desktop file and put the entire path for the icon. Should looks like:  \nIcon=/home/<user>/Icons/microsoft_office_word.png \nThis is the result:  \n\n", "Q: High Power Consumption and Wakeups on my Asus X54H So I've been using powertop to try and reduce the power consumption on my laptop as I only seem to get about 3 hours of battery.

Windows XP root drive (4 GB)\n\n\nI have a logical/extended partition, sda4 of 234 GB, divided into five disks (sda6~9).\nThe primary partition #3 (sda3) has only 4 GB space, which is quite insufficient (I need Windows only for MS Office, and a few odd engineering software; so I wish to use the least possible, but efficient, space for it). \nCan I install Windows XP to one of the disks (sda6~9) on the logical/extended partition without damaging the partition table structure and the in ANY of the primary and logical partitions/disks?\n\nPartitions structure: /dev/sda\n\n/dev/sda1   ext4   /       Oneiric-Ocelot       40G\n/dev/sda2   ufs            FreeBSD              20G\n/dev/sda3   ntfs           WinXP Pro            4G      #This will be formatted 'ext4' & contents of '/Mix' will come here\n/dev/sda4   extended                            234G\n    /dev/sda5   ext4    /Docs        Docs              34G\n    /dev/sda6   ext4    /Multimedia  Multimedia        186G\n    /dev/sda7   unallocated                            2MB\n    /dev/sda8   ext4    /Mix         Mix               10G   #Windows XP is to be installed here\n    /dev/sda9   linux-swap                             04G\n\n\nA: Windows can be installed not only on a primary partition but also on a logical partition. Yes, the bootloader of Windows installed on a logical partition won't run, but it can still be booted by the bootloader of an OS on a primary partition.\nThis is applicable for the users who want to install Windows on a logical partition with a preinstalled other version of Windows on the primary partition. It was done through the software EasyBCD.\n\nA: You can install Windows on an extended/logical partition if you already have a spare NTFS primary partition on the same hard disk. The Windows installer will install the OS on the chosen extended partition, but it needs the NTFS primary partition to install the boot loader.\nOnce Windows has been installed you can delete the spare NTFS primary partition if you want. But then you will have to install the BCD boot loader to the logical partition on which you installed Windows. Use bcdboot after booting into the Windows recovery command prompt (using the Windows installation CD). Substitute the drive letter as appropriate to your situation and then run the following command...\nbcdboot i:\\windows /s i:\n\nWhere i: is the drive letter assigned by the boot CD to the partition where windows has been installed. Use the Windows diskpart command to find out which drive letter is assigned to which volume.\nYou will now have to  configure GRUB2 to boot directly from this partition. Boot into Ubuntu and run the following command...\nsudo update-grub\n\nThe GRUB2 menu should now list Windows as an option.\nNote: If you have multiple versions of Windows installed on the machine then you should consider using the GRUB2 parttool command in your grub.cfg file to hide the partitions for other OSes during boot time.\nparttool (hd0,2) hidden- # Unhide the partition for current OS\nparttool (hd0,3) hidden+ # Hide the partition for the other OS\n\n\nA: I have another thing working, much more complex, but also works.\nFirst a warning for this scheme: If you have only one HDD it is possible that you will not be able to install Windows as the scheme is (i did not tried, i used a previous windows that was installed on a MBR disk by cloning windows partition with GParted).\nMusts i impose to my self (to make things really complicated):\n\n\n*\n\n*BIOS Only PC (no U-EFI, no EFI partition, etc) and only 32Bits support (no 64Bits allowed) to make things really hard\n\n*Only one HDD present (as in most Laptops) and no other storage (no USB, etc)\n\n*The HDD on GPT style (not MBR), here the warning, Windows can not boot from GPT in native mode (need one external or Virtual MBR disk to boot)\n\n*Grub2 as main bootloader\n\n*Multi-Windows 32Bits (Home versions), also to make things much harder\n\n*Isolated all windows, just to complicate things a little bit more\n\n*Main menu selection must make selected windows desktop appear (or at least the windows logon, that depends on how you configure the windows)\n\n*100% legal, so no copy any file from a different windows version, etc\n\n\nNote: I let XP away (does not support GPT), just for Vista to 10.\nBoot scheme is BIOS load Grub2 then memdisk is loaded and a VHD file (one per Windows) is mounted and chainloaded.\nThat VHD must be fixed size (just to allow memdisk lo loop mount it at boot), it is a virtual HDD that has a MBR scheme (needed to boot windows) with only one NTFS partition; the VHD itself is stored on a NTFS GPT partiton. This VHD files do the windows isolation, each windows has its own BCD, they do not use all the same BCD, so no need to present on boot a windows boot menu.\nInside that VHD, the partition is only used for nt60 boot code and BCD stuff. I used 32MiB for such VHD, and i get only near 2MiB free, so etter do not use less size or just do not put all locale BCD directories, etc.\nTo make all this work, you need to put nt60 code and BCD on that VHD file, so that VHD file must be mounted, that can be done with diskpart, and that can be also be done with install media.\nI did not test to do a full install, must in theory, if at install you mount that VHD, put nt60 code and BCD there, the install must allow you to continue (it can see a MBR disk and think it is pre-configured with another windows).\nI tried with a lot of 32Bits Windows Home versions (from Vista to 10) and they all boot correctly from a GPT disk, since they all see at boot a virtual MBR disk where boot nt60 code and BCD is.\nNow i am trying a different aproach / test:\n\n\n*\n\n*Same conditions as before but have only one MBR disk with only one Extended partition that is 100% of the disk, so no Primary partition at all is present.\n\n\nI know, if no primary partition present, windows will not be able to boot, but again i will use the trick of having a virtual MBR disk with a primary NTFS partition where i put nt60 boot code and BCD stuff; one per windows.\nConceptually if must also work, since Grub2 can be booted from inside Logical partitions (as well as most Linux, etc).\nWhy i do all such complex things? Easy answer could be 100% encrypt, each windows with its own password, etc.\nComplex answer: \n\n\n*\n\n*BitLocker send passwords to M$ and NSA servers and also has a Big Back Door that allows to mount them with no password at all.\n\n*TrueCrypt & VeraCrypt does not support multi-windows, neither have them isolated (they use a common place for their work), so only one windows can be protected, etc; please remember BIOS only & 32Bit windows home only\n\n*DiskCryptor allows to protect multiple Isolated Windows, also allow to protect GPT partitions (only data ones, no the system one)\n\n*I do not trust any other encryption that does not let you use cascade algorithms, etc.; i do not trust encryption that does not let me see the source code (what they try to hide? back doors? etc.).\n\n\nSo with the GPT scheme, DiskCryptor is not working at boot, i read source code and it does not have code to mount GPT partitions at boot time, so :\\Windows\\System32\\Winload.exe can not be found, so windows does not boot. I tested with two physical HDDs prior to download source code, i was getting mad, so i decided to download source code i could see missing source code for GPT mounting at boot time.\nSince DiskCryptor can auto mount at boot more than just one MBR partition (all the ones that uses the same password will be mounted) now i am trying the 100% Extended partition way.\nWhy not putting a physical Primary partition and store there the nt60 boot ode and BCD stuff? That way all windows can be installed and booted in native mode, no need for anything extra; but they will not be 100% isolated, they will share that partition, so if one touches it badly, can occur no one will boot, and again encryption 100% of the disk (all partitions, not boot sector, not partiton table, etc). will not be possible in isolated mode, at least one password must be used for all windows at boot time.\nImagine a real scenario:\n\n\n*\n\n*Multiply users, each one use its own Windows, so anything they do, they do it on its windows\n\n*If one user crashes its windows, they other users are not affected\n\n*Each user can have its own apps, also apps that requieres administrative privileges, etc\n\n*With isolated encryption, they can not read things of the other users.\n\n\nBest aproach will be each one using an external sata disk (seen as if it where internal), that they carry with them selves.\nBut i want it to be internal, etc.\nThe real motive is i like do things hard, complex and not allready done; i love to test my own skills, also is a way to learn a lot.\nHope your minds, now are more open to alternative ways of booting windows.\nP.D.: With Linux this things are much more easy, Windows make things mush hard than what is needed to be (nt60 code load bootmgr, that has a hard coded seach for only the MBR primary active partition where it will try to read winload.exe, etc).\n", "Q: How to make music?

In the past few days, it happens quite often that after I input my password to the login screen, Ubuntu shows only brown screen and gets stuck. No menus, no desktop icons, only a blank brown background, and pointer is movable. I have to press CTRL+ALT+DEL to reboot it. Then during booting, Ubuntu will check disk errors, then shows the login screen, and this time I can log into Ubuntu normally. Sometimes, I might even need to reboot several times. And this problem actually occurs long before, but only very occasionally at that time.\nSome other information that might be relevant:\n\n\n*\n\n*I suspect that this problem is caused by some problems in my disk. There are 10 bad sectors in my disk according to SMART data. And I see disk error checking during booting from time to time.\n\n*When this problems happens (after login, Ubuntu gets stuck and shows no desktop icons), I press CTRL+ALT+F1 and log into the computer, I cannot modifies anything in the computer. The disk is in readonly mode. Say I cannot save some edited text file, the shell shows the disk is read only.\n\n*In disk utility's SMART data, the self tests is failed(read). I notice this after I did a fsck and then clicked on self test in disk utility. But I am not sure whether this is caused by doing fsck. Since before doing fsck, I didn't look at self tests.\n\n*I am using EXT4 partion for Ubuntu, and it mounts three other NTFS partions. Will the NTFS partion's error cause this problem (if there are errors in NTFS partitions)? Or only the errors in EXT4 partion would cause this problem?\nThanks. \n\nA: Make a backup of your disk if you suspect error and experience boot problems already, if you haven't already made one.\nTry a scan for bad blocks. Start by checking what partitions you have: \nmount | grep sda\n\nThen for Linux partition found do:\nfsck.ext4 -ck /dev/sda7\n\nwhere you replace 7 with the actual partion number. \nThere is also a badblocks command, but I'm not familiar with it. It seems to scan the device filesystem agnostic. In other words, the filesystem used doesn't matter.\nman badblocks\n\nLeave checking NTFS to Windows.\nAllow some time to get this answer reviewed by other visitors.\n", "Q: large tmpfs /run partition - must it be so big? I am running Ubuntu 11.10 desktop on a couple of 8G RAM Wintel boxes. Both have been created automatically by the default installer with a 1.6GB tmpfs /run partition, where I suspect this amount of RAM could be more usefully used elsewhere in the system. I suspect that the installer takes 20% as the default, which is probably OK for boxes with lots less RAM, but seems overkill for an 8GB system. My question is - can I change its size, if so, how, and what are the risks in doing so?\nThe /run partition does not appear in the /etc/fstab file so it must be set up elsewhere.\n\nA: The size of a tmpfs partition is its maximum size. Only the part that's actually used takes up virtual memory (RAM or swap). Making the maximum size smaller will not save any memory.\nIt's unlikely that /run will take up more than a few megabytes. On the other hand, there's zero advantage to reducing the maximum size.\nThe non-disk filesystems used by the system (/dev, /proc, /sys, /run and a few others) are created by boot scripts in /etc/init and /etc/init.d. Don't edit those files unless you know exactly what you're doing.\n\nA: It is automatically pushed into swap when the kernel expects that RAM can be used more effectively otherwise. Check Wikipedia for more elaboration on this subject.\nLinux is highly optimized to use RAM as effectively as possible. Memory unused is money wasted.\nHere is the official kernel documentation.\n", "Q: Can Thunderbird handle all existing folders on hotmail account? I was wondering: is it true that Thunderbird cannot show folders on hotmail account that were created using your internet browser?\n\nA: As far as I can tell it can't.\nHotmail doesn't do imap. Thunderbird can only get mail from hotmail via the pop3 protocol which doesn't have any folder support.\niPhones & iPads seem to be able to use some Exchange protocol - thunderbird and apple mail can't.\nProtocol wars are painful.\n", "Q: Unable to restart Apache, getting error: apache2: bad user name ${APACHE_RUN_USER} I am getting this error trying to restart Apache, does anyone know how to fix this?\nThanks,\n\nA: To fix this problem, you have to make the changes to two separate files.\nFirst, edit /etc/apache2/apache2.conf, adding these lines:\nUser www-data\nGroup www-data\n\nSecond, edit /etc/apache2/envvars, adding these lines:\nexport APACHE_RUN_USER=www-data\nexport APACHE_RUN_GROUP=www-data\n\n\nA: This will set your apache2 ENV vars for the current session and allow you to use the apache2 binary without modifying your config:\nsource /etc/apache2/envvars\n\n/etc/apache2/envvars\nIs simply a script that sets some environment variables. When you use apachectl it processes this before launching apache2 itself. If you want to invoke apache2 from the terminal, you'll need those vars as well.\nSo invoking source /etc/apache2/envvars sets up the variables allowing apache2 to work outside of apachectl.\nYou could potentially set these up in a number of other ways. E.g. invoke envvars when you login.\n\nA: In my case, by restarting the machine the error went away (I had just installed apache2) and I was able to issue the command sudo /etc/init.d/apache2 restart and have apache2 restart.\n\nA: A temporary fix (that I used) was to edit the file in /etc/apache2/apache2.conf. Look for this:\nUser ${APACHE_RUN_USER}\nGroup ${APACHE_RUN_GROUP}\n\nand change it to this:\nUser www-data\nGroup www-data\n\nFor whatever reason, apache2 isn't looking in envvars to get the appropriate environment variables. The real answer to why this is happening is to track down why envvars isn't being consulted.\n\nA: Got this when I tried sudo /usr/sbin/apache2 -k restart.\n Actually apache2 in /usr/sbin was link to shared library '/lib/apache2/mpm-worker/apache2'  Instead sudo /etc/init.d/apache2 restart should be used as mentioned.\n\nA: I got the same error when trying to run apache2 -M also.\nI ended up just sourcing the envars file like this:\n. /etc/apache2/envvars\n\nThat set the environment variable properly since running apache2 outside of the standard init script.\n\nA: When I ran apache2 -M I got the same error.  Found this solution:\ngroupadd sshusers\n\nI have no idea why this fixed it, but it did.\n\nA: manually edit /etc/group and add www-data there then start apache\nadd www-data:x:1012:www-data at end of file and save it Ctrl-X Yes {enter}\n   (1011 was last num in my group file)\nstart apache\nsudo service apache2 start\nit worked in my case\n\nA: I had the sane problem and checked apache2ctl status and it said I needed to configure www-browser or adjust apache_lynx\nMy shell told me to install lynx, so I did, and that solved it for me.\nsudo apt-get install lynx\n\n", "Q: Windows randomly stop accepting input from bluetooth keyboard I've got a laptop running Ubuntu 11.10 with the most recent updates and an Apple Wireless Keyboard that syncs via bluetooth. The Ubuntu box is also a Synergy server, using QuickSynergy to run Synergy. I'm using xmodmap to swap the option and command keys, but nothing else.\nThroughout the day, windows that are long running will just stop accepting input. For example, I leave gnome-terminal up and running almost 24 hours a day. If it sits for a while, it just stops accepting input. It doesn't matter if I'm ssh'd into another machine or sitting on a local tty session, it just stops accepting input. If I open a new tab or window, those work fine. The 'broken' tabs stay broken.\nI'm also running Turpial (a Twitter client) which will do that same thing. I tend to use the arrow keys to navigate, and it just stops accepting input. Closing it and reopening it causes it to work fine.\nI don't seem to have the problem in Chrome, but I tend to open up new tabs when I go somewhere instead of using existing tabs.\nI've updated all the packages, rebooted, and the only thing that seems to cure it is if I type on the built-in keyboard, the window will start to accept text from the bluetooth keyboard (until it stops again). I don't think the keyboard is disassociating from the laptop because it can happen while I'm using the keyboard, it seems more linked with windows that I sit for a long time. As an example, I'm typing in Chrome with the bluetooth keyboard but I have a terminal window that won't accept input.\n\nA: Are you sure this has nothing to do with synergys tendancy to crash frequently? When I used synergy it would crash almost daily and I had to issue another terminal command to start it up again.\nEdit: Addition --\nCan you check /var/log/syslog at the time the keyboard cuts out (as best as you can) for any messages that are bluetooth related or keyboard/input, or any error messages at all between when the keyboard worked and when it didn't. Copy paste any interesting or curious log messages to your original question.\n", "Q: Problem in Loading certain Websites in Ubuntu 11.10 I have a DSL connection in Ubuntu 11.04 and am having problems loading content from certain websites(such as heroku.com, ubuntuforums.org) mostly providing CDN services, though google and gmail run perfectly. \nI have tried every suggestion asked at problem loading internet pages as I have the same problem. Also tried to remove the DNS Cache and Browser Cache.\nI have tried using Google DNS Server: 8.8.8.8 and 8.8.4.4, but nothing seems to work. Though when I browse the websites in Windows XP then it does not pose any problem.\nThis problem has come up only few days ago and has affected every browser(Chrome, Firefox and Opera) in Ubuntu 11.04.\nThanks in advance.\n\nA: I suffered this exact same fate, and also couldn't find anything on how to fix it. I did finally get it to work, and wrote a blog post titled Facebook, Youtube, LinkedIn and other CSS and JavaScript files from CDNs not loading on Ubuntu that explains the process I went through and things I tried.\nIn short, the solution was to create a manual connection to the router (i.e. not Automatic DHCP), with a custom DNS server. This is done by right-clicking on the connections icon -> Edit connections... -> Edit -> IP4 Settings. I used 8.8.8.8 as Primary DNS, but it could be anything other than the IP of the router, that is the default. The important thing here is that I'm circumventing the router when it comes to DNS traffic, as opposed to simply setting a different DNS server on the router itself.\n", "Q: Broken package manager due to incorrect Banshee package Sup, so, I'm not familiar with linux at all so help is much appreciated. \nI've been trying to boot my pc up from a live CD unsuccessfully.

I ahve no idea where it is, I don't see it in /opt or etc/apache .\nthanks!\n\nA: you can put your webpage in /var/www/ you will need sudo access to be able to change anything there. \nThese are your options to do so. \n1. Use mv on a file\nYou could use the terminal and the command mv. \nExample: \n\n\n*\n\n*cd /var/www/\n\n*mv ~/Desktop/FILENAME.html .\nThe dot isn't a misstake, it's that the destination is the current folder. \n2. use a text editor\nAnother way to do it is just to open gedit (or any other editor) and save your file in /var/www/. \nif you want to remove apache you could just type sudo apt-get remove apache in a terminal. If you are using apache2 then add a 2to the ending. \n3. Make a link to the root folder\nAnd if you are tired of having to use the root user to add a new webpage document, jsut make a link. Configuring Permissions for FTP and Apache\n\nBy the way, you don't need to go to your IP, you can just go to your localhost in your browser. If you have several files in your folder, just add a file name like this: localhost/myfile.html\n\nA: By default when to tell your browser to display \"localhost\" Apache will look in /var/www for a site to display. After a new Apache install it will find an index.html file. That is the file that displays the message you see. Index.html is the name normally used for the home page of a site. If no index.html file is in /var/www a directory listing of the files there will be displayed. You can replace the original index.html with an HTML file of your own. Don't forget that /var/www is owned by root.\n\nA: You can use synaptic to find all apache files and see where they are. \nFirst search for Apache, then right click on the package(s) and click properties. Select the installed files tab to see where the files are.\n\nApache stores its sites in /etc/www.\n\nA: As Fragos explains above; Apache will look in /var/www for a site to display. Apache looks for files commonly associated with a homepage such as index.php, after a new Apache install it will find an index.html file (this contains the text you see mention in the post). \nFragos is right that you can simply amend this file or you can delete it and create your page as you see fit ensuring you name it in a way that apache will find and serve this file as a the page. By naming it index.html, apache will prioritise this file to serve over any other file in the directory level /var/www. \nIf you want Apache to serve from a different directory i.e. a sub directory as can be used in Wordpress then you will need to match/configure the path/DocumentRoot in the respective virtual hosts file, which depending on OS can be found by cd/ete/apache2/**yourwebsitefolder**/sites-enabled & then sudo nano into 000-default.conf (unless you have created a dedicated Vhost for the website in question). You need to add;\nServerName www.yourwebsite.com\nServerAlias yourwebsite.com\nDocumentRoot enter the full path (1 level above) the website file to be loaded i.e. /var/www/yourwebsitefolder\nNote the above example path assumes your homepage/index.html is nested inside yourwebsitefolder.\nNote Wordpress would have \"index.php\" as it's alternative to index.html and this is what Apache will look/try to serve as a priority.  \nNow restart apache2, clear cache on your web broswer (to avoid potentially seeing a cached webpage). Now when you enter your site's name you should see the desired site - this is for internal netowrks/LAN, further steps required to make site accessible on the internet. \nTo access externally/internet you need to consider other aspects such as a domain name, port forwarding/secure host server, firewalls etc. This leads onto another sub topic which is easily found by amending your question accordingly. \n", "Q: Eye of gnome image bug with ATI graphic driver I just installed the ATI driver for my Ubuntu 11.10.

They may look the same, but what if you look at their menus (not just left-click, but try right click), particularly the \"about\"? Ubuntu has several standard bluetooth management applets and you might be running more than one of them.\nIn the terminal, type ps ax | grep blue and this will give you everything (and maybe a few more things) having to do with bluetooth running as processes on your system. There should be two of them that have something like \"applet\" as part of their name. If you're not sure, just paste in the whole thing in your answer and we can straighten it out.\nOk, so as fossfreedom pointed out, blueman is not in the default Ubuntu install, so the fix is to just uninstall that. \n\nA: A simple way to solve the two-bluetooth-icons problem on the indicator is:\n\n\n*\n\n*Open Ubuntu Software Centre,\n\n*Go to the Installed section,\n\n*Search for Bluetooth,\n\n*Remove the one except Blueman because it works best on 13.04.\n\n*Restart and you are done.\n\n\nA: Run this command to kill the blueman-applet ( ` is backquote ) \nkill -9 `ps axu | grep blueman | awk '{print $2}'`\n\n", "Q: How to change icon of an webapp created with Chromium? I've created a webapp for a website with Chromium. The problem is that the icon it's a small size one and it doesn't look nice.\nHow can I change the icon with one created by me?\n\nA: The easiest way to do this is downloading a picture (preferably .png format with at least 96x96 pixel) and then right-clicking on the application link.\nGo to properties and click on the icon shown on the left-hand side of the properties dialog.\nYou can now choose a picture.\nPoint to the location you have saved the picture you want to use at (for example Downloads) and then just select the image file you'd like to use.\n\nA: When you save the webapp, save it to Desktop only. Open a text editor, such as gedit or Kate, and press Ctrl+O to Open a file. Navigate to your desktop within the file open dialog and you will see a file named \"chrome_http___....desktop\" or something similar. Open it and then replace the line that says Icon:chrome-http___...

I have a 40 gig drive and a 200 gig drive. Which one should I install Ubuntu on, and which one should I use for my normal files ie: music, documents, etc... \n\nA: I would pick the fastest for the Operating System.  \nMy guess is that your 200 gig drive is newer and may be faster. You can check the specifications.   \nAlso you can open Disk Utility (palimpsest) to do a benchmark.   \n\nFinally, if the 200 gig is really the faster, I would consider using it for both System and Home, and leave the 40 gig for backup. \n\nA: Memory access is measured in nanoseconds (ns) while drive access is measured in milliseconds (ms), several orders of magnitude slower. This means that the operating system (which includes /swap) should be on the fastest drives you have. I used 'drives' rather than 'drive' because when / and /swap are in separate partitions on the same drive, there are a lot of ms lost when the physical drive heads have to move back and forth between the partitions (latency). Separate drives can be read and written simultaneously, two partitions on one drive cannot, meaning that partitioned drives are 'thrashed' more, and consequently have much shorter mean-time-between-failures (mtbf) times.\nYour data should be kept on a separate physical drive as well, to avoid loss if the system drives become corrupted or damaged (and the system drives will always fail sooner). By data, I mean the actual data sub-dirs of home, Download, Documents, etc. as the .hidden sub-dirs of home often contain program files that benefit from the fastest drive access available.\nSo, to have a safer system, get as much RAM as you can afford (reducing /swap activity), and have at least three hard drives. Anything less, especially computers with only one hard drive, are \"resource-constrained\". If you have to use only two drives, put the /swap and data partitions on the slower of the two.\nFinally, seriously consider getting a solid-state drive (SDD) for your system drive. They are faster and much more durable than hard drives although more expensive per gig, but that's fine as the OS usually takes up much less storage than data.\nHope this helps.\n\nA: At my dormitory environment I usually create a 10 GB partiton for /, 1 GB for swap and I use the rest for the /home partition. In your case I would suggest the following:\n\n\n*\n\n*Use the fastest hdd for / and swap (I guess your 200 GB is a SATA one). Create the /home also there.\n\n*Use the other hdd for a different mount like /data or something like that.\n\n*If both HDD are on the same connection (IDE or SATA), then use the smaller one as /, swap and /home\n\n*I use ext4 for / and xfs for /home and /data\n\nA: Depending on your needs. I am using it on a 30GB partition and I have a lot of free space (19GB). So for me that 40GB drive would be enough. In my oppinion the 40GB drive would be enough for the OS.\n\nA: I am using it on a 40GB partition and I have a lot of free space (29GB). So according to me that 40GB drive would be enough. In my oppinion the 40GB drive would be enough for the OS. And you can use your 20 GB for other OS, music, video etc. because if you install windows or any other OS. in that, Using partition than your partition except the Other OS will be accessible in Ubuntu. \n", "Q: tool to scan similar images What tools might be available in Ubuntu to scan many image files and detect similar ones despite different sizes, formats, etc?\nSupport for batch mode/cli would be especially good. For example, so I could write a script to favor the higher resolution/color depth versions and delete others.\n\nA: Graphically Digikam can do that.\n\n\nFor the command line you can use findimagedupes.\nThe simple command to find recursively and report similar images is findimagedupes -R ~/Pictures.\n", "Q: How can I install the ATI video card driver for Ubuntu 11.10? \nPossible Duplicate:\nIs my ATI graphics card supported in Ubuntu? \n\nHow can I install the ATI video card driver for Ubuntu 11.10?\nCan someone please help me?\n\nA: The best driver, Gallium 3D, should automatically be enabled and installed.\nTry running a 3D game like Neverball or Neverputt, you can find both in Ubuntu Software Center.\nIf they don't work install fglrx (not the post-release update) with Additional Drivers in System Settings.\n\n\nA: This steps worked for me and what you probabably should do is upgrade you ATI drivers.

Often people wanting to know if Ubuntu will run on a potential hardware purchase are advised to use the LiveCD, perhaps in-store, to check hardware compatibility.

Dynamic resizing of the screen was working in prior versions of Ubuntu. In the process of trying to fix this I reinstalled the Parallels Tools and it made no difference. The screen resolution is \"stuck\" at 800x600 -- Thats all that the system can detect.

In parallels desktop, go to the Device menu>CD/DVD1>Connect Image…\nTo get to the iso specified above, from an OS X terminal, simply run open /Volumes/Parallels Desktop 8/Parallels Desktop.app/Contents/Resources/Tools/\nThis will open a folder to the location of the iso.

You might note that it is similar to the aforementioned guides, but with additions and differences: I have found it is possible not to use account-hooks or folder-hooks in some cases. See the Mutt wiki for an alternative take on setting this up. \nI will post the elements of the setup and then post my entire .muttrc so you can see how it all fits together.\nIt is easiest to enter the settings of both of your accounts in separate files and save them in the ~/.mutt folder. As an example, your two accounts could be called account.gmail1 and account.gmail2. So create two text files with those names and follow this template below for the contents; they should be both identical apart from the user@ part; just replace all occurrences of that with your real email (e.g. mik123@) in both files.\nset imap_user = \"user@gmail.com\"\nset imap_pass = \"\"\nset from = \"user@gmail.com\"\nset realname = \"user\"\nset hostname = gmail.com\nset folder = \"imaps://user@imap.gmail.com:993\"\nset spoolfile = \"imaps://user@imap.gmail.com/INBOX\"\nset postponed = \"imaps://user@imap.gmail.com/[Gmail]/Drafts\"\nset record = \"imaps://user@imap.gmail.com/[Gmail]/Sent Mail\"\nset smtp_url = \"smtp://user@smtp.gmail.com:587\"\nset smtp_pass = \"\"\n\n\n\n*\n\n*Note that I have left the password blank (\"\"), which means you will be prompted for it, and that is what I prefer, but you can integrate your own solution if you don't want to have to keep entering the password.\n\n*If you want a default account loaded at startup, you can use in your .muttrc a similar line to this, just specify your own config file.\nsource \"~/.mutt/account.gmail1\"\n\n*To actually switch between the accounts, place a shortcut in your .muttrc referring to the actual location and name of your account configs:\nmacro index <f4> '<sync-mailbox><enter-command>source ~/.mutt/account.gmail1<enter><change-folder>!<enter>'\nmacro index <f5> '<sync-mailbox><enter-command>source ~/.mutt/account.gmail2<enter><change-folder>!<enter>'\n\n*You will be able to switch between folders within both accounts with pager commands such as \nmacro index,pager ga \"<change-folder>=[Gmail]/All Mail<enter>\" \"Go to all mail\"\nthat are defined in your .muttrc; these will still work for each account (see my attached .muttrc).\n\n\n*\n\n*I tested these particular settings with the additional general ones in my .muttrc, so you can use that file and/or collate it with your own, it is up to you.\n\n\nNow just load mutt in terminal and you should be able to load up one account and then switch to the other one using your shortcut. My .muttrc is pasted here if you need a working example of a configuration. \nSee the good article on this site on Mutt and the Mutt wiki for further ways of setting up mutt such as using folder-hooks to associate setings with various mailboxes, which is also explained here. \n", "Q: 32-bit or 64-bit for a Intel Celeron 2.93Ghz processor? \nPossible Duplicate:\nWhat is the difference between 32bit and 64 bit and which should I chose? \n\nI read somewhere that Ubuntu 12.04 64-bit is recommended by Canonical.. but my machine is not AMD64.. So which one should I prefer? 64-bit or 32-bit?\n\nA: If you are not using a 64-bit machine then the i386 (32-bit) image is the one for you...\nAlso going by your answer you say it's not AMD64 (an actual AMD processor) which is fine, AMD64 images will run on 64-bit Intel processors as well...\n\nA: Your cpu is 32-bit. Use the 32-bit version.\n\nA: If you're running a 64-bit Intel processor then I would highly suggest using the AMD64 images(these will still work), as some applications are only available to run on 64bit machines.

Ubuntu is removing -server flavour, as specified on release notes of 12.04: \n\n\n*\n\n*https://wiki.ubuntu.com/PrecisePangolin/ReleaseNotes/UbuntuDesktop#PrecisePangolin.2BAC8-ReleaseNotes.2BAC8-CommonInfrastructure-1.Kernel\n\nAs with Beta-1, the Beta-2 kernel no longer carries separate amd64 -server and -generic kernel flavors. These have been merged into a single -generic kernel flavor to help reduce the maintenance burden over the life of this LTS release.\n\nThe differences between -generic and -server seems to be related to preempting, the timer interrupt and the i/o scheduler, as stated on: https://help.ubuntu.com/10.10/serverguide/C/preparing-to-install.html#intro-kernel-diffs\nI'm asking for technical specs. \n\n\n*\n\n*So, what happens now? \n\n*Will the server edition run the desktop kernel with no performance penalty? \n\n*Is this justified somehow?\n\n*What happens with that differences? \n\n*Can they be changed in userspace? \n\n*There are not appllicable as of 12.04? \n\n*If the answer is yes, this change will involve performance penalty? \n\n\nAll of them are questions that can be answered. I'm asking for a specific change on a package, not anything else.\n\nA: As you noticed in the release announcements, the generic and server kernel flavors were merged for the 12.04 release in an effort to reduce the maintenance burden over the life of the LTS.  The two kernel flavors actually only differed with regards to 2 major kernel config options: the default I/O scheduler and the preemption model.  \nThis was discussed in detail on the Ubuntu Kernel Team mailing list \n\n\n*\n\n*https://lists.ubuntu.com/archives/kernel-team/2011-October/017471.html\nAs noted in that thread, the default I/O scheduler changed from \"deadline\" to \"cfq\".  However, anyone wanting to remain with the Deadline I/O scheduler could do so at boot time by setting elevator=deadline.  \nThe preemption model changed from CONFIG_PREEMPT_NONE to CONFIG_PREEMPT_VOLUNTARY.  At this time, I unfortunately do not have any performance benchmarks on hand to point you at.  Hope this helps some.  Thanks.\n\nA: Your \"why\" question is answered within the quote you were providing - because it is easier to maintain this way. The kernel functionality is parametrized quite well, you can change things like the scheduler at run-time, so there is no pressing needs for different defaults to be compiled in.\nFor the exact reasons and the discussion of details you would have to ask on the Ubuntu KernelTeam mailing list - see the informational KernelTeam Wiki page for contact information.\n\nA: What happens now is that there is only one kernel for both server and desktop.  The IO scheduler can be changed at runtime if you want, but CFQ is the most feature complete and actively maintained scheduler, so it is a good default.  Which one you use makes little difference under most workloads.  The server kernel used to disable even voluntary kernel preemption because theoretically it could give slightly better throughput, but I am not aware of any performance measurements that actually show any benefit there, so in practice, servers will not be affected by moving to the desktop premption model.  The kernel is also tickless ( CONFIG_NO_HZ ), meaning that it schedules timer interrupts only when needed based on currently running application timers rather than at a fixed interval, and I believe this has been the case for several releases now, despite what the server guide says.\nTL;DR:  There was no benefit to maintaining another kernel for servers, so the practice has stopped.\n", "Q: Not able to compile dbus-ping-pong I have downloaded files from \nhttp://cgit.collabora.com/git/user/alban/dbus-ping-pong.git/tree/\nI am trying to compile it using the command  \ngcc pkg-config --libs --cflags dbus-1 dbus-glib-1-2 glib-2.0 -o dbus-ping-pong dbus-ping-pong.c\n\nHowever, I get errors:\n/tmp/ccmJkxXb.o: In function g_once_init_enter:\ndbus-ping-pong.c:(.text+0x22): undefined reference to g_once_init_enter_impl\n/tmp/ccmJkxXb.o: In function\ndbus_glib_marshal_echo_srv__BOOLEAN__STRING_POINTER_POINTER:\ndbus-ping-pong.c:(.text+0x52): undefined reference to g_return_if_fail_warning\ndbus-ping-pong.c:(.text+0x79): undefined reference to g_return_if_fail_warning\ndbus-ping-pong.c:(.text+0x9d): undefined reference to g_value_peek_pointer\ndbus-ping-pong.c:(.text+0xac): undefined reference to g_value_peek_pointer\ndbus-ping-pong.c:(.text+0x109): undefined reference to g_value_set_boolean\n/tmp/ccmJkxXb.o: In function echo_ping_class_intern_init:\ndbus-ping-pong.c:(.text+0x122): undefined reference to g_type_class_peek_parent\n/tmp/ccmJkxXb.o: In function echo_ping_get_type:\ndbus-ping-pong.c:(.text+0x162): undefined reference to g_intern_static_string\ndbus-ping-pong.c:(.text+0x192): undefined reference to g_type_register_static_simple\ndbus-ping-pong.c:(.text+0x1a8): undefined reference to g_once_init_leave\n/tmp/ccmJkxXb.o: In function echo_ping_class_init:\ndbus-ping-pong.c:(.text+0x1cd): undefined reference to g_type_class_add_private\ndbus-ping-pong.c:(.text+0x1e2): undefined reference to dbus_g_object_type_install_info\n/tmp/ccmJkxXb.o: In function echo_ping_init:\ndbus-ping-pong.c:(.text+0x1fe): undefined reference to g_type_instance_get_private\n/tmp/ccmJkxXb.o: In function echo_ping:\ndbus-ping-pong.c:(.text+0x21d): undefined reference to g_strdup\n/tmp/ccmJkxXb.o: In function client:\ndbus-ping-pong.c:(.text+0x265): undefined reference to dbus_g_proxy_new_for_name\ndbus-ping-pong.c:(.text+0x2c3): undefined reference to dbus_g_proxy_call\ndbus-ping-pong.c:(.text+0x2d1): undefined reference to dbus_g_error_quark\ndbus-ping-pong.c:(.text+0x2f1): undefined reference to dbus_g_error_get_name\ndbus-ping-pong.c:(.text+0x305): undefined reference to g_printerr\ndbus-ping-pong.c:(.text+0x31d): undefined reference to g_printerr\ndbus-ping-pong.c:(.text+0x328): undefined reference to g_error_free\ndbus-ping-pong.c:(.text+0x358): undefined reference to g_print\ndbus-ping-pong.c:(.text+0x363): undefined reference to g_free\n/tmp/ccmJkxXb.o: In function main:\ndbus-ping-pong.c:(.text+0x38f): undefined reference to g_type_init\ndbus-ping-pong.c:(.text+0x3a3): undefined reference to dbus_g_bus_get\ndbus-ping-pong.c:(.text+0x3c7): undefined reference to g_object_new\ndbus-ping-pong.c:(.text+0x3df): undefined reference to g_type_check_instance_cast\ndbus-ping-pong.c:(.text+0x3f9): undefined reference to dbus_g_connection_register_g_object\ndbus-ping-pong.c:(.text+0x406): undefined reference to dbus_g_connection_get_connection\ndbus-ping-pong.c:(.text+0x426): undefined reference to dbus_bus_request_name\ndbus-ping-pong.c:(.text+0x43a): undefined reference to g_main_loop_new\ndbus-ping-pong.c:(.text+0x44a): undefined reference to g_main_loop_run\n\nHow do I resolve this issue ?\n\nA: Linking stuff goes at end, try that:\ngcc $(pkg-config --cflags dbus-1 dbus-glib-1) -o dbus-ping-pong dbus-ping-pong.c $(pkg-config --libs dbus-1 dbus-glib-1)\n\nBy the way, after compiling successfully using that command, I launched the program und i've got that:\n\nError: The name com.example.DBus.Echo was not provided by any .service\n  files\n\nDo you know how might we use that program?\nPS: I've used $( ... ) rather than backticks because it didn't pass the form correctly.\nPS2: I've found the solution at my own question:\nCreate the file \"/usr/share/dbus-1/services/com.example.DBus.Echo.service\" with the following content:\n[D-BUS Service]\nName=com.example.DBus.Echo\nExec=/home/telecom/bachelordbus/dbus-ping-pong/dbus-ping-pong server\nUser=root\n\nThank you, Eliah, for the explanations.\n", "Q: How to stop Ubuntu loading/booting up?

Just to be clear, I'm not talking about the Launcher or the Dash. Of course Ubuntu Classic/Fallback doesn't have the Launcher/Dash, but this is not the difference I'm talking about. I mean differences related to performance, features, functionalities, compatibilities, etc. These kinds of differences. I'm asking this because I've heard the Fallback Mode is kind of \"incomplete\" when it's compared to Gnome Shell or Ubuntu Unity, so I just wanted to know whether or not it's true, because if it's true, I don't think using Fallback Mode is worth it.\n\nA: The standard Unity interface makes use of your graphics card's OpenGL capabilities to composite the different windows to form the desktop image.\nThe Gnome fallback mode doesn't make use of compositing, so rather than applications drawing to their own buffers and having the compositing manager draw those buffers to the screen, they instead draw to the screen directly.  This is simpler and can the performance difference can be noticeable if you have an underpowered video card or the video card drivers are not up to scratch.\nWith that in mind, there is also a \"Unity 2D\" login option you can choose that doesn't act as a compositing manager.  For the most part it should perform roughly as well as the Gnome fallback mode.  So if you like the Unity interface but are having trouble with performance you might want to try that.\n\nA: One thing is certain though, the Fallback Mode is more productive and useful than the standard, default session. You don't get the full repertoire you may expect, but there's progress, good, healthy progress. In one fell stroke, you gain some 50-60% of your expected desktop functionality, which restores a bit of sanity and hope. Theoretically, you could get your old desktop back with some careful work on extra features, backward compatibility and a dab of visual polish. Experienced Linux distribution developers could pull this off easily, rebranding the skeleton looks with their own unique touch.

It is 64 bit, there is the Intel 64 support which is an x86-64 extension like AMD64.\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Intel_Core_i3_microprocessors\nAnd here:\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intel_64#Intel_64\n\nA: All i3 supports Intel 64, which is Intel's implementation of x86-64, so yes, i3 is 64bit.\n\nA: All Intel Core i3 Processors (Sandy Bridge and Clarkdale ) are 64x architecture. Even though Clarkdale is based off of Westmere architecture, they use 64 bit architecture. I'm willing to bet this is a typo or something, considering the entire \"i\" generation was meant for 64 bit architecture to meet the expanding needs to computers RAM requirements, laptops incorporated graphics (internal GPU) and, higher processing/ thread count. \n\nA: Another option to determine if your processor is 64-bit is to look up at http://ark.intel.com/.\n\n\n*\n\n*Select your Processor family from the Desktop processors category.\n\n*Select your model from the list.\n\n*Look for the Instruction Set field in the specification page.\n\n\nIf it says „64-bit”, you've got a 64-bit processor.\n", "Q: Unable to connect Vodafone Huawei dongle I am using ubuntu 11.04 and I am trying to connect Vodafone Huawei dongle to access internate,But I am not getting any success to connect the net.Can someone tell me where I am doing the wrong part?Any help and suggestions will be highly appreciable.\n\nA: It seems that this modem has problem in 11.04 as per google results.

I want a command to shred completely the contents of a folder/directory (which may be inside folders/directories).\nAlso please explain the command.\n\nA: *\n\n*Install the package secure-delete.\n\n*Use the command srm -r pathname to remove your folder and files.\n\n\nThe default settings are for 38 (!!!) passes of overwrites which is extreme overkill imho (see more info about this here).\nFor my usage, I only want a single pass of random data so I use srm -rfll pathname.\nIf you want to create a right-click option in the GUI for files and folders, use gnome-actions to call a script like this:\n#!/bin/bash\nif dialog=`zenity --window-icon=warning --question --title=\"Secure Delete\" --no-wrap --text=\"Are you sure you want to securely delete:\\n\\n     $1\\n\\nand any other files and folders selected? File data will be overwritten and cannot be recovered.\"` \nthen /usr/bin/srm -fllrv \"$@\"| zenity --progress --pulsate --text=\"File deletion in progress...\" --title=\"Secure Delete\" --auto-close\nfi \n\nIf you want more paranoid settings be sure to modify the above script.\n\nA: sudo apt install wipe\n$ wipe -rfi dir/*\nwhere the flags used:\n\n-r – tells wipe to recurse into subdirectories\n-f – enables forced deletion and disable confirmation query\n-i – shows progress of deletion process\n\n\nA: Shred works only on files. You need to shred the files in the dir/subdirs first and then remove the directories. try\nfind [PATH_TO_DIR] \n\nand make sure you only see the files you want to delete\nfind [PATH_TO_DIR] -exec shred -u {} \\;\n\nthen remove the dirs with \nrm -rf [PATH_TO_DIR]\n\n\nA: For files not directories, here's a more simple way instead of -exec shred -u {} \\; type of way:\ncd to your directory.\n\nthen\nfind . -type f -print0 | xargs -0 shred -fuzv -n 48\n\nthis does 48 passes recursively to the current directory you cd'ed into.\nHope this helps some.\n\nA: You probably want to use something similar to this:\nfind dir -type f -exec shred -fuz {} +\nrm -rf dir\n\nFirst command finds only files and passes them to shred (as many at once as possible - no need to start a new shred process for every file like \\; does). Finally, remove the directories too.\n\nA: I have inserted the following bash script for this purpose in my .bashrc\nfunction rm2 {\n\n  for var in $@\n  do\n  if [ -d $var ]\n  then\n     nohup $( /usr/bin/find \"$var\" -type f -exec  shred -n 2 -u -z -x {} \\;;/bin/rm -rf \"$var\" ) & \n  else\n    nohup /usr/bin/shred -x -n 2 -u -z \"$var\" & \n  fi\ndone\nexit\n}\n\n\nA: If you want to do this from Nautilus (aka 'Files' app), then you could use the nautilus-wipe package.\n\n*\n\n*sudo apt-get install nautilus-wipe\nOnce installed, there will be two new options when you right-click on a folder: Wipe and Wipe available disk space. Choosing Wipe on the folder will give further options (e.g. number of passes, fast mode, last pass with zeros).\n\nA: When I need to shred multiple files or an entire directory I simply use shred -vzn 20 ./shredme/*.* for example, which overwrites all files with any file extension in the \"shredme\" folder. Then you can use the standard rm -rf ./shredme command to remove the folder itself (or just right click and delete the folder) as all the data has been overwritten 20 times for this example.\nI did a quick example of this with a bunch of duplicate images as an example. \n\n", "Q: LibreOffice-Mono integration I had an old .NET Framework application running with Mono using OpenOffice and it worked very well.\nNow I've just installed Ubuntu 11.10 Server and I discovered that it moved to LibreOffice, so I installed this suite on Windows, compiled using LibreOffice's CLI dlls and (on Windows) it works.\nOn Ubuntu I installed LibreOffice using sudo apt-get install libreoffice, but when I try to run my EXE I get a \"TypeLoad Exception\"; after an hard debug (see https://stackoverflow.com/questions/10029620/mono-libreoffice-system-typeloadexception) I discovered that CLI libraries are missing.\nI remember that with OpenOffice I had to install cli-uno-bridge package, but I'm able to find it anymore on Oneiric.\nI've also tried to use updatedb and then locate cli-, but these libraries seem to miss on my system.\nHow can I install them?

To find out http://packages.ubuntu.com/natty/  search for the old package name.  At the bottom there's a list files option.  In this case I used libcli_uno.so\nsudo apt-get install apt-file  \nsudo apt-file update  \napt-file libcli_uno.so\n\nYes, there is no package that provides it at the moment  \nIf you're using those two debs, I would move them into a separate folder.

It's a bit of a weird setup because I installed Wubi to my hard drive containing Windows XP and then later installed Windows 7 to a different drive, but that's neither here or there.\nThe last time I booted into Ubuntu, which was probably a few days ago, Unity 3D worked just fine. A little slow, but fine nonetheless. Today I boot up, and Unity doesn't want to work at all. The top bar turned into rainbow glitchiness if I tried to do anything, the dock bar would not do anything, and the whole thing was insanely unresponsive.\nI'm not entirely sure what the problem could be. Windows 7 felt the need to run CHKDSK completely out of the blue recently, but since it only scanned C: and Wubi isn't installed at what Windows 7 thinks of as C:, I find it hard to think it's that. (The last time CHKDSK ran on a computer I owned, it was on a Dell laptop trying to fix a defective hard drive, and it caused more damage than it fixed. So I'm suspicious of CHKDSK.) I can't think of any major updates that occured recently that could lead to this.\nThankfully, Unity 2D still works, so I'm not completely locked out. I was using NVidia's proprietary drivers (the one marked \"recommended\", whichever one that may be), and they worked fine until recently. Any ideas what I could do?\n\nA: Don't just apt-get remove video drivers.  It leads to this situation.  What you should do is remove them with additional drivers aka jockey-gtk:\n\n\nClick remove and it will toggle to noveau for you\n\nA: This appears to be a problem with the Apr 11th update to the Nvidia driver.  The bug is occurring across distros and is being tracked at Bug #980298.  A temporary workaround is to remove it:\nsudo apt-get remove nvidia-current nvidia-current-updates\n\n", "Q: High CPU usage while playing Flash and using Jupiter Hi guys from what I see by Googling around it's a common problem but somehow all the threads I've seen end in \"Oooo Flash is terrible\" and the post dies there.\nI'm experiencing a very high CPU usage 100% and more while watching any Flash videos.\nWhat I'm running:\n\n*\n\n*Latest Flash version available for 64bit in Ubuntu's repositories\n\n\n*Athlon X2-QL64 on a HP Compaq 615\nNOTE that I'm experiencing the same issue on a Celeron T3300 with Intel video card\nWhat I tried:\n\n*\n\n*Different browser (Firefox and Chromium behave the same)\n\n*Disabled the separate plugin-container process and made Flash run in firefox.exe (same behaviour)\n\n*Changed shell.

Looking at the parts list, I don't see anything exceptional that you would have a problem with. As with all upgrades, ensure that you have a backup of your most critical information before proceeding. Also, regarding your BIOS, if it's working fine, please please don't change it :). It would be really helpful if you ran the Ubuntu Friendly suite to let us know how your platform is doing.

The device file for the key is created, but not for the partition.\nIf I compare the dmesg output between a working key and my problem key, it is identical except for one line which is missing when using the problem key: uba: uba1. It would appear from this that mknod is never creating a node for the disk partition.\nThe weird thing is that I can do...\nsudo sfdisk -R /dev/uba\n\n...to force drive partitions to be re-examined and suddenly the partition will be recognised, mknod will create a device file it and I can access the key all fine and dandy like. Some kind of timing issue?\nEDIT:\nAutomount USB Rules:\nACTION==\"add\", KERNEL==\"ub[a-z]*[1-9]*\", PROGRAM=\"/sbin/blkid -o values -s TYPE %N\", RESULT==\"vfat\", RUN+=\"/home/ubuntu/.mount_usb %k %n\"\nACTION==\"remove\", KERNEL==\"ub[a-z]*\", RUN+=\"/home/ubuntu/.unmount_usb\"\n\nAlso:\nThe problem key defaults to FAT16 when being reformatted. Forcing it to FAT32 results in udevadm monitor --property spitting out exactly the same properties for the device and partition as for a working key, but the problem still remains. This leads me to think that it's less likely to be a problem with the device detection rules and perhaps a problem with the device itself? Is this a logical conclusion?\n\nA: Just from the /dev/uba naming structure, it sounds like you created your own UDEV rule and now it's not working out for you. We'll need to see that code to assist you.\nI'm sure you've consulted this already but just in case please consult this reference for creating UDEV rules. http://wiki.debian.org/udev\nFeedback based on update\n\nACTION==\"add\", KERNEL==\"ub[a-z]*[1-9]*\", PROGRAM=\"/sbin/blkid -o values -s TYPE %N\", RESULT==\"vfat\", RUN+=\"/home/ubuntu/.mount_usb %k %n\"\nACTION==\"remove\", KERNEL==\"ub[a-z]*\", RUN+=\"/home/ubuntu/.unmount_usb\"\n\nIt looks like your predecessor didn't know about usbmount. This rule will only\nwork on vfat formatted drives, now you could expand that list, or... you could install\nusbmount and tweak it to create the device names you want. Then you have something\nthat's maintained for you with only minor configuration changes vs a complete home brew\nsolution.\nBTW, there's a syntax error in there, it's value not values, running this from the CLI shows.\n\nsudo blkid -o value -s TYPE /dev/sdb1\nvfat\n\nSo the %N is the input, e.g. the block device and RESULT is stdout. This is detailed in the udev man page. You might be able to do something like this RESULT==\"[vfat|fat16]\", or you could forward the output to a script and do a richer comparison there. A quick look at the usbmount package shows that rich comparisons are done in the callout script for both add and remove. I strongly recommend you migrate to usbmount.\n", "Q: x11vnc not working in Ubuntu 12.04 x11vnc used to work fine, but in the new 12.04 release I can't get it to work.\n\n\n16/04/2012 17:22:35 x11vnc version: 0.9.12 lastmod: 2010-09-09  pid: 16524\n16/04/2012 17:22:35 XOpenDisplay(\"\") failed.\n16/04/2012 17:22:35 Trying again with XAUTHLOCALHOSTNAME=localhost ...\n16/04/2012 17:22:35\n16/04/2012 17:22:35 *** XOpenDisplay failed.

However, I want to heavily customise that installation, which takes far too long to do when trying to apply to the thumbdrive installation.\nAs a result, I want to make an installation of Ubuntu on my laptop HDD, in a separate partition to a Windows installation, and do my customising there (as it is a lot quicker). Then I will use FSArchiver to copy that installation to the thumbdrive, which should then be bootable.\nIt seems to have mostly gone fine, except that when I try to boot from the USB drive GRUB comes up with the error that there are missing operating systems. As a result, I can only manage to boot from my HDD. How do I avoid this?\nI know the reason is that GRUB expects to find Windows XP and a second Ubuntu installation, which are not on the thumbdrive, but is there a way to customise GRUB once it is on the thumbdrive, considering that I cannot boot into it?\n\nA: I use \"grub-customizer\" to do the same thing, though I am using dd to copy the filesystem over to the usb drives.

When I then try to make some kind of selection anyway (blind to the actual content I am selecting of course), I just get a blank white image. \nI am not surprised that I am having such difficulties. I guess it is due to how Shutter is accessing the pixel content of the desktop via either the Xorg stack, or through some interface to the working memory of the  graphics card; there just must be a difference when running in a VM vs natively, but my knowledge bottoms out here :(\nI tried using the GNOME screen shot utility and it seems to suffer from the same problem; I could have lived with it's limited feature set if it had worked. Then I tried enabling the ScreenShot plugin from CompizConfig Settings Manager and hey presto I got images (they are saved on the desktop), but the power of this facility of Compiz -- holding the Windows key and drag-selecting an arbitrary region of the screen -- is painfully limited compared to the feature set offered by Shutter.  \nEven if a solution for Shutter is not forthcoming, some insight into how the screen capture tool interfaces to the Xorg or GPU driver that can shed some light on this would be great. A specific solution for use with Shutter would be champion!\n\nA: In past versions I have known that the problem is actually with Compiz and doing the screenshot from within virtualbox. So Virtualbox + Compiz inside Guest = Black/White Screen.\nYou need to either use Ubuntu 2D or disable 3D effects in Virtualbox for that Guest.\nNow it would be nice to see if you can test the following:\nWindows Host with Ubuntu Guest - Try Screenshot of Ubuntu\nUbuntu Host with Windows Guest - Try Screenshot of Ubuntu\nUbuntu Host with Ubuntu Guest - Try Screenshot of Ubuntu\nIn all 3 cases activate/deactivate 3D effects (Compiz)\n", "Q: Screen flickering / scrambling on an Asus UL30A Recently my Laptop screen started to flicker.\n\n\n*\n\n*You can view the phenomena here: YouTube\n\n*Sometimes the screen is totally scrambled, but most of the time it starts with the Title bar only.\n\n*It happens inconsistently.\n\n\nMy Laptop is Asus UL30A and I'm using Ubuntu 11.10.\nOutput from command:\n\nsudo lshw -C display; lsb_release -a; uname -a; xrandr\n\n  *-display:0             \n       description: VGA compatible controller\n       product: Mobile 4 Series Chipset Integrated Graphics Controller\n       vendor: Intel Corporation\n       physical id: 2\n       bus info: pci@0000:00:02.0\n       version: 07\n       width: 64 bits\n       clock: 33MHz\n       capabilities: msi pm vga_controller bus_master cap_list rom\n       configuration: driver=i915 latency=0\n       resources: irq:44 memory:fe400000-fe7fffff memory:d0000000-dfffffff ioport:dc00(size=8)\n  *-display:1 UNCLAIMED\n       description: Display controller\n       product: Mobile 4 Series Chipset Integrated Graphics Controller\n       vendor: Intel Corporation\n       physical id: 2.1\n       bus info: pci@0000:00:02.1\n       version: 07\n       width: 64 bits\n       clock: 33MHz\n       capabilities: pm bus_master cap_list\n       configuration: latency=0\n       resources: memory:fe800000-fe8fffff\nLSB Version:    core-2.0-ia32:core-2.0-noarch:core-3.0-ia32:core-3.0-noarch:core-3.1-ia32:core-3.1-noarch:core-3.2-ia32:core-3.2-noarch:core-4.0-ia32:core-4.0-noarch\nDistributor ID: Ubuntu\nDescription:    Ubuntu 11.10\nRelease:    11.10\nCodename:   oneiric\nLinux steelke 3.0.0-14-generic-pae #23-Ubuntu SMP Mon Nov 21 22:07:10 UTC 2011 i686 i686 i386 GNU/Linux\nScreen 0: minimum 320 x 200, current 1366 x 768, maximum 8192 x 8192\nLVDS1 connected 1366x768+0+0 (normal left inverted right x axis y axis) 293mm x 164mm\n   1366x768       60.0*+\n   1360x768       59.8     60.0  \n   1024x768       60.0  \n   800x600        60.3     56.2  \n   640x480        59.9  \nVGA1 disconnected (normal left inverted right x axis y axis)\nHDMI1 disconnected (normal left inverted right x axis y axis)\nDP1 disconnected (normal left inverted right x axis y axis)\nDP2 disconnected (normal left inverted right x axis y axis)\n\nI already rolled back the kernel to 3.0.0-14 instead of 3.0.0-17 as mentioned in this post, but without result.\nI guess the problem is related to the driver, because I don't see similar behaviour in the BIOS Setup.\nAny tips or help is welcome.\n\nA: My computer is ASUS A43E.

It's an additional package.  apt-cache search doesn't find it, so it's not in the Ubuntu repositories.  Video description also says s/he's using Arch Linux and refers to AUR, which is the Arch repositories.  \nUnless you want to figure out how to compile and use it in Ubuntu, or find someone that's done that already (maybe there's a PPA), if you want that tiling behavior, you'll probably have to switch from xfwm to another window manager that supports tiling.  \nAbove in the comments, someone mentioned you could look into using Awesome (but later deleted that comment).  I mentioned you can use Awesome inside XFCE.  It's actually probably easier to use XFCE apps inside Awesome than the other way around.  If you install awesome using apt-get, you will find an awesome session installed in the graphical login manager (lightdm).\nYou can then configure awesome to autostart various XFCE apps, such as xfce4-power-manager (important for power management functions like suspend and shutdown on low battery), xfsettingsd (daemon which makes sure some, but not all, XFCE settings are executed, such as display settings and gtk theming), xfce4-panel (so you can use the panel you are accustomed to), xfce4-volumed (xfce volume daemon), etc.  Awesome doesn't support compositing, but you can get that by autostarting xcompmgr.  There's a lot of info online on how to run this stuff in Awesome, including elsewhere on this site.  \nHere's a basic tutorial for using Awesome.  \nIf you want to run Awesome in XFCE, that's not difficult, but Awesome needs to be reconfigured to work properly with the XFCE panel; I don't know how easy that is (my guess is it's not hard, but it's a time investment in any case).\n\nA: Out of the box, most non-tiling managers and desktop environments such as XFCE/Xubuntu does not have tiling support.\nA notable exception in Compiz which can be used with the majority of Desktop environments such as Xubuntu/Unity but not Gnome-Shell.\nSpecifically for Xubuntu, to get mouse tiling support you will need to either compile or install a modified window manager such as this Q&A:\nAutomatically size windows using Xfce like in gnome\nTo get keyboard tiling support without compiz and a non-tiling window manager, you will need to be more inventive and control the window position and sizing yourself - this answer gives you this solution.\nHowever, for the best tiling support you should use a dedicated tiling-window manager such as Awesome.\nKeyboard Tiling\nA basic python script on launchpad allows you to control windows such as moving them to the left or right.\nI've slightly modified this to work with XFCE/Xubuntu and to allow you to install in either 11.10 or 12.04.

In some BIOSes unplugging the USB drives removes it from the list of boot devices so you need to do this every time you want to boot from USB, with your flash drive plugged in when you open BIOS setup.\nUbuntu, or any other OS, has absolutely no control over the early stages of boot process - basically, your BIOS decides which device to boot from before it invokes GRUB or any code from Ubuntu. \n\nA: I have similar problem and it's not BIOS or any other settings problem, but installation USB device and installation process itself.\nSomehow after install, files on pendrive changes and pendrive is no longer bootable. Exporting Ubuntu to the same pendrive again resolves problem (or workaround).\n", "Q: Upgrade to Precise messed up GRUB2 I just upgraded from Oneiric to Precise and it messed up my GRUB2, now I can't boot and keep getting an \"error: no such partition\" error.

It seems to be an undocumented/unsupported feature, but if you open a csv (comma separated spreadsheet) with Libreoffice, it will calculate formulas that start with = in the text file. Unfortunately I don't see a way to keep the formulas when saving back to csv, it simply writes the numbers. Is there some option to keep formulas?\n\nA: It's possible to make Calc save formulas instead of values. You need to make sure that:\n\n\n*\n\n*on the Sheet, Formulas instead of the resulting values are displayed, and\n\n*the CSV Export filter is set to save cell content \"as shown\".\nWith these settings, Calc will not only show the formula, but it will put the formula as plain text in the CSV export. The next time you open the sheet, Calc will recognize the formula and calculate its result.\n\n1. Show Formulas instead of Values\nTo display the formulas instead of their result values on the sheet, you need to check the display settings in Calc'c \"View\" options:\n\n\n2. CSV Export Filter Settings\nBy default, the CSV export filter settings are set to export cell content as shown on the sheet. So, if displaying formulas is activated (as explained above), it will export the formula by default. But it will not work if exporting content as shown is deactivated.

To test how well my new script works on the production login page, I changed my /etc/hosts to point assets.example.com to my localhost (and set up Apache accordingly).\nThe only problem now is that the login page loads https://assets.example.com/script.js (Again, I have no influence on this!).

As you can see in the screenshots, this varies from theme to theme. Is this a problem with the themes or a problem with the Beta and is there anyway to fix this?\n\n\nA: You can edit these files manually in the ~/.themes directory.  I would find a working 3.4 theme like Axiom, and compare where things have gone afoul.

My questions are, can I do this with this configuration? What does \"internal raid\" mean? Is it true that \"Internal RAID Not Enabled\" will not allow me to use 2nd SSD as a system drive? \nThanks in advance! \n\nA: Leave RAID to Linux when you need it, don't enable it in your BIOS. You don't need RAID to use your second drive, it is just a mechanism to make your two drives appear as if it is one larger drive (or a mirrored one). For most consumer grade motherboard based RAID implementations, the Linux implementation is superior. In Linux RAID is supplied by md (metadevice).

Thus the \"workaround\" function. [edit:] This one is better done using the first answer below. I changed the script to reflect that and had no hang since.\n- Although the script seems to work (its only used by myself, no multi-user requirement), i was unable have it in the launcher. [edit:] No solution until now.\n\nFailed tries:\n\nProblem 2:\n- create .desktop-file, validate it with desktop-file-validate, install with desktop-file-install, reboot => still not there although i installed to the recommended directories.

Daher konnte kein Snapshot angelegt werden.\"\nfi\n\n\nA: If you want your action to be transient and disappear without being explicitly dismissed, you should pass the --timeout option to zenity --notification to specify how long the notification should display if not explicitly dismissed.\nThe argument takes an integer, which is treated as the number of seconds the notification should display for.  For example:\nzenity --notification --timeout=5 --text=\"A notification that shows for 5 seconds\"\n\nAlso note that the popup dialogue you get with this command on Ubuntu is due to notify-osd not supporting actions in its standard notification bubbles (a deliberate choice).  Unfortunately, there doesn't seem to be a way to tell zenity to not add a default action to its notification, so it doesn't integrate as well as it could.\nIf you really do want a dialog box rather than a transient notification bubble, consider using the --info mode instead:\nzenity --info --text=\"A simple information dialog\"\n\nYou can combine this with the --timeout option if you want the dialog to automatically close if the user doesn't dismiss it manually.\n\nA: Finally...\n\nReally, i dont know why... i did not manage to solve my launcher related problem \nby hand...

We're going to do this by adding Unity quicklist support & appmenu support.\nIs it possible for the app to only utilize the app menu? If the user is not using Unity they won't get any menu bar. The only reason why we want the menu to be in the Ubuntu version is for the sake of desktop integration.\n\nA: Yes, certainly that's not a normal use case :-)  So there are a couple of ways to do things.  What the Chrome developers have done is create the menu bar but leave it hidden, it gets picked up by appmenu-gtk but isn't shown. \nAnother option is to just look for the UBUNTU_MENUPROXY environment variable.

I have a luks setup with encrypted partition. And I don't want everyone on my computer to see that I have such partition. Unfortunately it shows up in the nautilus \"devices\" panel as \"Encrypted partition\".\nIs there a way to prevent it from showing there? I managed to setup authentication with usb key and I don't want the encrypted partition show in the panel.\n\nA: You can use the mount option x-gvfs-hide in /etc/fstab to hide it in nautilus, for example.\nFor example, a line in /etc/fstab would become:\n/dev/sda1 /mnt/sda1 ext4   defaults,x-gvfs-hide       0     2\n\nEdit:\nOr you can create a fake line in /etc/fstab like this\n/dev/sda2 /mnt/sda2 ext4 noauto,x-gvfs-hide 0 2\n\nfor the sole purpose of hiding it in nautilus. It will not be mounted so the mount point could not exist.\n\nA: This question deserves an update for Ubuntu 16.04 with user friendly steps.\nWhat you see on the left side of Nautilus are your partitions. Mounted ones have the eject button beside them, unmounted ones do not. To mount the partition click on the name. Then you can navigate the folders and files.\nYou want to hide partitions so they don't appear in Nautilus.\nStart Dash the first option on the Launcher\nType Disks and you will see the application Disks appear. Click on it.\nA screen similar to this appears:\n\nLeft click on a Disk. Then left click on the Partition you want to hide.\nRight click on the gear (follows the Left Arrow and -) and select Edit Mount Options and this screen appears:\n\nUncheck the option Show in User Interface.\nClick OK and enter password to apply changes. After the next reboot Nautilus won't show the partition. Note that this doesn't erase the partition or delete any data on it.\nIf you need clarification please post a comment below.\n\nA: You can just add it to /etc/fstab (this will cause it to be mounted automatically at startup). If you specify a mount point outside /media you don't see it in Nautilus anymore.\nFor those who don't know how to do this here's an example:\nIf you had a logical volume /dev/sda2 of the filesystem-type ext3 that you want to mount to a directory Music, because it contains your Music, you have to add the following new line to /etc/fstab:\n/dev/sda2 /mnt/Music ext3 defaults 0 0\n\nFor other filesystems or names you just edit this line.\nThen, you save the file, make the mount point with sudo mkdir /mnt/Music, or whatever you want to name the mount point. If you don't want to reboot to see the change, just once execute sudo mount -a. \n\nA: To avoid command line, you can open Applications > Disks.\nSelect the partition you want to hide, click on the gear icon (\"additional partition option\") > Edit Mount Options and unchecked \"Show in user interface\". Reboot, the partition is now hidden.\nTested on Ubuntu 16.04 LTS\n\nA: The following works for me on Ubuntu 18.04: \n\n\n*\n\n*Create a udevd rule:\n$ sudo touch /etc/udev/rules.d/99-hide-disks.rules\nwith the following contents:\nENV{ID_FS_UUID}==\"<UUID>\",ENV{UDISKS_IGNORE}=\"1\"\nreplace the <UUID> with the UUID of the partition that should be hidden in Nautilus. \n\n*In order to apply these new settings to Nautilus without a reboot, execute the following commands:\n$ sudo udevadm control --reload-rules\n$ sudo udevadm trigger\n", "Q: White menu colour on Ubuntu 12.04 live boot \nPossible Duplicate:\nChange default right click menu color from white to black? \n\nI was playing with my new Ubuntu 12.04 by live booting and I found the desktop right click menu has white color, but on the panel it turns black.

I also have ssh installed.\nDo apache and ssh come by default with Ubuntu?  \nI do have LAMPP but I thought I had kept it disabled. \nYet, I can see an apache initial page that shows that it's working.\n\nA: Apache does not install by default (But it could be installed with another program if apache is a depedency). If apache is running anyone can connect to it (If you have not blocked)\nIf you don't want apache, run sudo apt-get remove apache2 to uninstall it. \nIf you want to stop apache from starting at boot time, run sudo update-rc.d apache2 remove\n\nA: Here's the answer guys.

It installs apache2.2 and all apache dependencies you need to run a simple web server.\nThe default path of server will be \"/var/www\"\nI unknowingly did that.

I have a server with a storage network which currently supports jumbo frames.\nI want to enable just eth1 to have that ability.  What settings do I change and what is the best way to test the configuration?\n\nA: The question is phrased like there's a way to globally turn it on. I'm not aware of that method, here's how I'd turn it on:\nsudo ip link set eth1 mtu 9000\n\nOr (as this is a server) if you're using the /etc/network/interfaces configuration, you can simply stick it in at the end like so:\nauto eth1\niface eth1 inet static\n        address ...\n        netmask ...\n        network ...\n        broadcast ...\n        gateway ...\n        dns-nameservers ...\n        mtu 9000\n\nI suggest you test the MTU rate with ip before you persist it in /etc/network/interfaces. Oh and you'll need to run sudo service networking restart if you only used the second method there.\nYou can verify the configuration with ip:\nip link show eth1\n\nAnd there are various things like traceroute --mtu that can measure and test that MTU.\n", "Q: Non-executable (NX) memory warning on an HP Proliant DL380 G5 I am getting the following warning message from a new installation of Ubuntu 10.04 (server version) on an HP Proliant DL380 G5:\nYour CPU appears to be lacking expected security protections.\n\n  $ /usr/bin/check-bios-nx --verbose \n\n\ngives me:\n\n\"This CPU is family 6, model 15, and has NX capabilities but is unable to\nuse these protective features because the BIOS is configured to disable\nthe capability\"\n\n\nand:\n\n$ grep ^flags /proc/cpuinfo | head -n1 | egrep --color=auto ' (pae|nx) '\ngives me:\nflags       : fpu vme de pse tsc msr *pae* .... \n\nThe Security/CPUFeatures documentation  here, states that, \"the first flags line will include nx if the BIOS is not disabling the CPU feature, and the CPU is actually NX-capable\"\nTo summarize so far, \"nx\" is not shown in the flags line from /proc/cpuinfo, whilst \"pae\", is...

(Manually triggering the ssh key dialog window would be OK as a solution, but I don't know how to do that).\nMy use case is that I use tmuxinator and want to set up multiple ssh connections. So I want the ssh key unlocked. Otherwise all the ssh key dialog boxes all pop up and I have to enter my passphrase multiple times. Or I can ssh somewhere before launching tmuxinator, but the connection is slow here, so that just adds friction.

Recently when I was trying Ubuntu 12.04 beta I got to know that it was using a PAE kernel, but I am not sure of the reason. \nWhy has Ubuntu shifted to PAE kernel ?\nAlso Is there a non PAE version also available?\n\nA: Simple: To support vast quantities of RAM in a 32bit environment.\nLots of people were installing the (then) recommended 32bit install and wondering why their new computers with 4 and even 8GB of RAM were only showing 2-3GB. By using the PAE kernel, the vast majority of that RAM is now addressable and usable.\nThis is fine for people who have computers built this century. To get a computer that doesn't have 32bit PAE support, we need a really old computer. We're talking PII/Geode level old, but also Pentium M machines like lots of Thinkpads.\nThese are computers that should be thrown into the sun. They are far below what people throw out and much better machines can be had for almost nothing on Ebay and the like.\n\nThere's an added side-effect of PAE that I've only just become aware of: NX. In 64bit mode all users get NX (No eXecute) which allows the system to separate out storage RAM from process RAM. This allows an application to suffer a buffer overflow without then being able to stuff a ton of malicious executable code in RAM and run it.\nThat's a obviously massive simplification but to further answer the question: it makes the computer more secure too.\n\nAnd what's more to appease the super-low-end users the defaults for Lubuntu and Xubuntu will be a non-PAE kernel.\n\n\n*\n\n*https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu-cdimage/+bug/955009\n\n*https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu-cdimage/+bug/958866\nIf you are on a lower-end computer, chances are you won't want Unity eating up the few remaining CPU cycles you have left, so they're a much saner starting point anyway.\n\nA: Here is also an answer. You can read it: https://lists.ubuntu.com/archives/ubuntu-devel/2011-November/034498.html\n\nEvery flavour has \n  its unique class of bugs; non-pae has a ginormous and ugly NX emulation \n  patch that has consumed substantial maintenance resources in the past, \n  not to mention all of the bugs complaining about memory holes and the \n  4Gb limit.\nThe kernel team has limited resources.\n\n\nA: Yes, The non PAE version is available.\nI am not sure about the availability of the full desktop environment, \nhowever I am using This minimal Non-PAE version.\nAfter installing the minimal OS, you may configure it according to your needs.

After adding the preload package, my applications seem to speed up but if I copy a large file, the file cache grows by more than double the size of the file. \nBy transferring a single 3-4 GB virtualbox image or video file to an external drive, this huge cache seems to remove all the preloaded applications from memory, leading to increased load times and general performance drops.\nIs there a way to copy large, multi-gigabyte files without caching them (i.e. bypassing  the file cache)? Or a way to whitelist or blacklist specific folders from being cached?\n\nA: There is the nocache utility, which can prepended to a command like ionice and nice. It works by preloading a library which adds posix_fadvise with the POSIX_FADV_DONTNEED flag to any open calls.\nIn simple terms, it advises the kernel that caching is not needed for that particular file; the kernel will then normally not cache the file. See here for the technical details.\nIt does wonders for any huge copy jobs, e. g. if you want to backup a multi terabyte disk in the background with the least possible impact on you running system, you can do something along nice -n19 ionice -c3 nocache cp -a /vol /vol2. \nA package will be available in Ubuntu 13.10 and up.

The & character after a command launches the command in the background allowing the next statement to be executed immediately without waiting for the previous one to finish.\nSo, your script is launching one instance of conky in the background using the config1 file and then launching another instance of conky in the foreground using the config2 file and then waits for that instance to finish before processing the next exit line.  If you change your script to have a & after each conky command like this...\n#!/bin/bash\n\nconky -c ~/Conky/scripts/config1 &\nconky -c ~/Conky/scripts/config2 &\n\nexit\n\n...it will not wait for them to finish before processing the exit command.\nAs John and Eliah stated, && is used to chain two commands together with the second one executing only if the first one completed successfully.  This is generally done from the command line as opposed to a script.  This explains why after you made this change the second instance of conky never launched.  The first one never finished so that the second could start.\nI hope that clears some stuff up.\n", "Q: What low latency live streaming solutions exist for low bandwidth connections In a couple of weeks in my country there will be a open source event (FLISOL) and the group is trying to figure out how to stream the event live with a slow connection.\nWhat options are in Ubuntu that can help in streaming the live event with a low speed device over the internet.\nThe internet speeds vary between 8KB/s up to 40KB/s and we want a way to have low latency without sacrificing a lot of quality.\nSince the event will be on the 28th and 12.04 will come out on the 26th. the version of Ubuntu that will be used will be 12.04.\n\nA: Maybe the easiest and most stable solution would be to set up an Icecast server where you can define the bandwith per mount point (see also this question). This will also allow very low bitrates at the cost of quality of course.\nBy using Darkice as a streaming client you are able to stream the sound output of your soundcard, which would alos allow mixing of microphone or other sources before streaming. To set up Darkice for low bandwith streams you may edit the configuration file included e.g. like follows:\n[icecast2-0]\nbitrateMode     = cbr       # fixed bit rate\nquality         = 1.0\nformat          = mp3       # format of the stream: ogg vorbis\nbitrate         = 32        # bitrate of the stream sent to the server\n[...]\n\nBoth applications are available through the repositories: icecast2  and darkice .\n", "Q: Flash player won't start after Ubuntu update very new on Linux as well on Ubuntu. I have install in my PC the Ubuntu 11.10 and after a regular Ubuntu update, the Flash player cannot start.\nI have uninstall the Flash player several times to tryother versions of the flash but still the flash cannot start in my browsers (I use both Firefox and Chrome).\nNote that I install the flash player with browsers closed.\n\nA: These instructions assume the problem is not caused by a non-Adobe plugin for Flash, which in your case, given what you said, seems like a reasonable assumption.\nFirst, completely remove the flash player by running this command in a Terminal window (Ctrl+Alt+T):\nsudo apt-get purge adobe-flash\\* flashplugin\\*\n\nNow, you should also remove all user-specific files created by Adobe Flash (and other Adobe software) before, which may be causing the problem:\nmv ~/.adobe ~/.adobe.old\nmv ~/.macromedia ~/.macromedia.old\n\nActually, those commands don't remove anything--they just rename the folders so Adobe Flash won't use them anymore. However, you can feel free to remove them afterwards.\nThen install Adobe Flash. You can do it in the Software Center or with:\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get install flashplugin-installer\n\nYou have a 32-bit system so whether you install flashplugin-installer or adobe-flashplugin doesn't matter, but if you had a 64-bit system then it would be better for you to use the adobe-flashplugin package. The flashplugin-installer package only provides the 32-bit version of the plugin. (I'm providing command-line instructions for flashplugin-installer rather than adobe-flashplugin only because you might not have the software source for adobe-flashplugin--the partner repository--enabled.) By the way, some instructions say to install flashplugin-nonfree--that is equivalent to installing flashplugin-installer.\nSince it doesn't work in either Firefox or Chrome, clearing user-specific browser files is probably unnecessary. However, if the above method does not work, you should see if the problem occurs in the guest account (or any other user account--you could even create a new account to test). If the problem did turn out to be user-account-specific, then you'd want to clear browser-specific files to see if that would solve the problem.\n\nA: I had exactly the same problem. \nTry to install this add-on on firefox : \nhttps://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/flash-aid/\nAfter installation, click on \"quickmode\" and \"install stable flash\". It will open your terminal, remove the old version and install the new one. \nGood luck! \n\nA: The best way to fix this problem is to download the latest google chrome browser, that's it.\nNow my flash player is working properly.\n", "Q: Highlighting to Copy with Terminal I'm wondering if there is a terminal enhancement, or a way to make the terminal to where when I highlight over anything it auto copies whatever I highlight.

Does it have API? If not, whats the simplest PDF viewer that does?\nWhat I do want to create: Maybe annotations (which could be shared via an external file) or creating hyper links to Wikipedia. That sort of thing. You could even have remote control where the viewer could sync many open documents across different computers all at once. Not sure yet.\n\nA: In principle evince can be controlled through its dbus api. An example of its application is the SyncTeX plugin for gedit, which allows easier editing and browsing of latex source files in combination with evince. On the other hand, the dbus api itself has been found to change sensibly from gnome 2 to 3 and it's somewhat hidden so you'll have to dig into the evince source to find the exposed methods.\nConcerning annotations: as of version 2.31 evince supports adding (but not deleting) annotations. This feature is currently broken in evince 3.2 (the version shipped with Ubuntu 12.04) due to a regression but a fix has been released upstream.\n", "Q: Is there a CLI webcam image grabber that works with a video4linux2 device?

It may be offered \nin your Linux distribution's Xawtv package. To install streamer try\n\n# sudo apt-get install xawtv\n\nTo take a standard JPEG picture from the command line where the camera is accessed \nthrough /dev/video0:\n\n#streamer -c /dev/video0 -b 16 -o outfile.jpeg\n\nWhere > -b is the number of colors (in bpp,whether 15, 16, 24 or 32)\n& -o is the output filename in the current directory\n\nIf you are going to capture multiple images be sure to append the output file name \nwith zeros, as streamer can name the capture files in sequence, i.e., -o \noutfile000.jpeg becomes outfile001.jpeg, outfile002.jpeg, and so on.  \n\nFrom comments: streamer is not included in the xawtv package, sudo apt-get install streamer\n", "Q: How to allow key functions while desktop locked Is it possible to allow a keyboard's volume keys to continue working when your desktop is locked? Currently, the default behavior disables all special-function keys until the desktop's unlocked. I like to use my PC as a music player and leave it locked when I'm not directly at the console, but I still want to let people to control the volume if a song's too loud.\n\nA: Somewhat of a shameful plug, but since there didn't seem to be any existing solution, and since the task seemed relatively straight-forward, I wrote a simple Python daemon to fix the problem. It uses the python-xlib API to capture system-wide key presses and then runs custom shell commands. It assumes a basic Debian/Ubuntu setup, but would probably work on most Linux systems with a few tweaks.\nFor my case, the volume up/down keys map to the code 122/123, so the corresponding commands to lower or raise volume only when the desktop is locked are:\ngnome-screensaver-command -q | grep \"is active\" && bash -c '/usr/bin/pactl -- set-sink-volume `pacmd list-sinks | grep -P -o \"(?<=\\* index: )[0-9]+\"` -10%'\ngnome-screensaver-command -q | grep \"is active\" && bash -c '/usr/bin/pactl -- set-sink-volume `pacmd list-sinks | grep -P -o \"(?<=\\* index: )[0-9]+\"` +10%'\n\nAdmittedly, that's a bit verbose. The second grep is to find the active sound interface on systems that might have several (e.g. my laptop has a Master and Headphone interface, allowing these commands to control either).\nEdit: This no longer works as of Ubuntu 16.

The machine uses an Intel core 17 2670qm processor, and a 64 bit operating system.\nI downloaded Ubuntu 11.10 and installed it on a USB drive, which is how i use it. I still have Windows 7 on the machine. When the machine is booting up I hit F12, and run Ubuntu from the flash drive instead of the machine booting Windows, as it normally would.\nOn the Ubuntu menu, on the top right area, there is a battery menu, which shows how long to charge battery, or how much life left etc..with a fully charged battery the most Ubuntu will give me is 1.5 hrs. I've adjusted all power setting etc by clicking on the battery meter where i can make these adjustments, and have even turned down the brightness on the monitor. \nI've read through these questions here, and a user wrote to install Ubuntu 12(?)(the alpha version) when it's out this month(april), and this has better power management. Other forums (Ubuntu wiki) state that windows 7 controls power management effectively because it's configured to work with the hardware.\nI'd like to install Ubuntu and wipe windows but can't because of this issue. I need my notebook to go hours, not an hour and a bit. \nCan anybody recommend possibly a good software to use, that will work with the machines\nbios under Ubuntu? Another thought of mine, is- since I didn't yet wipe windows off my hard disk, is windows still possibly controlling the power mgmt aspect on the machine? \nI've thought of calling tech support at Dell and asking for help there, maybe Dell has something (a tweak?), I can download that'll work under Ubuntu.\nLooking forward to any help/suggestions i can get here, i'm really stuck on this..\n\nA: This may be a little late but, keep in mind that Dell laptops have their CD/DVD players running through the USB system and if you are running a Live CD this will drastically reduce your battery life.

In Ubuntu 12.04LTS, I get 7+. So yes, Ubuntu 11.10 has some issues with power use. My desktop too. When I used 11.10, the fans went wild, so to speak. In 12.04LTS, it was cool and quiet. \nSo these are known issues, though they aren't necessarily easy to fix. Some of the issues, for example, is said to be caused by the inability to optimize because of erroneous information provided by the hardware. \nAnyway, most if not all, of those issues have been fixed in 12.04LTS. So I would just upgrade if I were you. It is a little early, but I don't think you'll run into any problems. 12.04LTS has been quite stable for a good while now. You may want to have a quick live testrun (CD or memory stick), but you shouldn't run into anything, I think. \nThese issues are not caused by Windows. It is caused by Ubuntu. We've never had anything like that in any prior version of Ubuntu, so it's a great exception. Some have called 11.10 the \"Vista of Ubuntu\". I don't think it's far off. It's nice and stable, but it has some issues with performance and battery life. \nPS: From the way you wrote \"to install Ubuntu 12(?)(the alpha version)\", I take it you're not familiar with how Ubuntu versions work. 12.04LTS simply means it's released in April 2012. 11.10 means October 2011. Very easy to remember. (Compared to another operating system vendor which uses the name \"7\" for a product version 6.1 and \"8\" for 6.2:)) \nThe LTS means it's a special version that's supported for 5 years.

While I might be wrong as I'm yet to actually try it, the experience I have with MPEG4 and h.264 tells me that HTTP Live Streaming will be rather computationally intensive—you'll end-up encoding up to 4 h.264 streams for one stream, and h.264 takes more 'effort' to encode than MPEG2.\nI've been looking at the same thing for my MythTV box, and the most promising thing I've found so far (though I'm yet to actually try it) is Carson McDonald's HTTP Live Video Stream Segmenter and Distributor.\nI've also considered grabbing an Elgato turbo.264 as there are apparently linux drivers available.\nOh, and if you're in a country that uses h.264 for HD broadcast (like the US—I'm in Australia where we use MPEG2 for everything) you may not even need to transcode the video (at least for the high-bandwidth stream). \n\nA: i don't know for sure, but i use this pms-linux to stream to my ps3. maybe it'll work for ipad somehow. \nhttp://www.ps3mediaserver.org/\ngood luck.\n", "Q: Ubuntu Code of Conduct updated – should I?

I don't know if this could be the cause, but at the moment I don't understand what it could be.\nThank you for your help\n\nA: When you run the sudo command in the Terminal, that causes what you type after sudo to be run as root. This is why it works from the Terminal--because the technique you are using makes you act as root.\nBeing an administrator does not mean you are root, or that most of what you do is done as root. It does mean that you can perform actions as root with a couple of built-in facilities (one of which is sudo).\nWhen partitions are mounted automatically from /etc/fstab, the mount operation is performed by root, so it is necessary to be root (or run a command as root) to undo it. This is the normal and expected behavior, and not a bug.\nWhen you mount partitions dynamically as a non-root user, behind the scenes, that uses udisks --mount. Then you can unmount them automatically with udisks --unmount (which is what happens behind the scenes when you unmount them). The way you fixed your problem prevents this from happening, because /etc/fstab entries are not mounted/unmounted dynamically with udisks.\nSo it seems that the way you've fixed your problem does not fully suit your needs. I recommend that you post a new question detailing the problem you were experiencing, so that someone can help you make automatic, non-root mounting and unmounting of your Windows partition work again.\n", "Q: How to deal with wpa_supplicant error?

This will automatically configure correctly UFW if there's any error with your firewall. \n\nA: This could actually be the network router itself reserving port 22 for administrating itself. It makes sense if it worked when changing the port to 27.

Ubuntu does not ask for Keyring unlock untill after I open either Chromium or firefox. Also sometimes I may be on for 30+ minuets then the screen blanks and I get the Ubuntu login screen asking for my Password again. Can ANYone please tell me what is wrong and how to fix it as I am quite new to linux and am still unfamiliar with bash \n\nA: There are a few possibilities:\n1. You have multiple keyrings\nWhile the login keyring is unlocked automatically via a PAM module, other keyrings are not.  It is possible that you have a second keyring called default that needs to be unlocked by an explicit keyring password prompt.\nThis keyring might have been created if you used an application when the login keyring was not available for some reason.\nYou can easily check what keyrings exist by starting the Passwords and Keys application and checking the Passwords tab.  There will be a top level entry for each keyring.\nIf there is a second keyring and it only contains passwords you remember and can re-enter, I would suggest deleting the keyrings other than the one called login.\n2. You performed an administrative password change\nThe PAM module that unlocks the login keyring using your login password.  When you perform a normal password change, where your old password is requested before entering your new password, the PAM module re-encrypts your keyring with the new password.\nThis breaks down if you ever performed an administrative password change.  That is, any password change that doesn't request the old password before setting the new one.  Since the old password is not provided, it can't re-encrypt the keyring.\nYou should be able to recover from this situation by manually setting the password on the login keyring to your current login password.  This can be done from the Passwords and Keys application.  On the Passwords tab, right click on the top level entry for the login keyring and pick Change Password to fix things up.\nWhen you log in next time, it should automatically unlock your keyring.\n", "Q: Enable thumb detection on MacBook Pro I have successfully installed Ubuntu 11.10 and 12.04 on my MacBook Pro 8.1 and now I have issues with my touchpad.

I don't know what release/flavor of Ubuntu you're running so it's hard to provide optimal instructions for bringing that up graphically, but you can probably bring it up by running gksu software-properties-gtk.\n\nA: Many universities run their own Ubuntu mirrors. You should ask around and see if there is a local mirror.\n", "Q: How do I set up a private apt repository that can support multiple versions? I'm looking on how to setup a private apt repository (on 10.04 LTS) that can support multiple versions.\nI understand that you cannot have multiple versions of a package installed on a server. This is a purely for a development environment where we want to be able to test multiple versions before releasing them to the production apt repository.\nI know you can have multiple versions by putting the version number in the package name, however I want to achieve the opposite, support multiple versions of a same package name.\ne.g. packagename_1.0_all.deb  and packagename_2.0_all.deb rather than packagename-1.0_1.0_all.deb and packagename-2.0_2.0_all.deb\nFor those that are familiar with Puppet automated eployment - we can specify what version of a package we want on a server (with the ensure tag using the same package name).\nI've tried Google's debmarshal described at http://wiki.debian.org/HowToSetupADebianRepository but could not get it to work due to a lack of documentation.\n\nA: I needed a multi-versioned repo for the same reasons like you and this is what I ended up with:\napt-get install apache2 dpkg-dev\nmkdir -p /var/www/repo/binary\n\nThen create update-repo.sh that will update your repo with the packages' info\n#!/bin/bash\ncd /var/www/repo\ndpkg-scanpackages -m binary /dev/null | gzip -9c > /var/www/repo/binary/Packages.gz\n\nPlace your .deb files in /var/www/repo/binary and run update-repo.sh\nOn the rest of the machines:\necho \"deb http://myserver/repo binary\" > /etc/apt/sources.list.d/myrepo.list\napt-get update\n\netc etc...\nThe magic happens because of -m when running dpkg-scanpackages. Without -m, only one version is listed in Packages.gz\nI haven't tried it but it should be trivial to do the same for separate sub-repos, like hbdgaf proposed.\n\nA: Host it under a different distribution name.  lucid and testing for example.

That lead to me only seeing this on a reboot.\nWhich leads to my question: I read up on migrating my Wubi install, and I think it's time for me to format over XP (don't know why I hold on to it, since I have Windows 7 on that tower as well) and install Ubuntu on my second hard drive. I'm ready to copy my root.disk off of my computer, but I have a question with the migration process. \nI borked something up bad on my Wubi install, so if I were to migrate my data from my Wubi install's virtual disk to my upcoming 12.04 install done the old-fashioned way, would my mistakes carry over to my new install? I don't think I'll lose anything of importance, but if I have the chance to recover that stuff, I'd like to take it.\n\nA: First let's fix what happened on the other question.  \nYou shouldn't just apt-get remove video drivers.  You should use jockey-gtk to switch between open drivers and closed drivers.\nPress CTL+ALT+F1 to get to a terminal.  Log in.  \nUpdate\nsudo apt-get update\nGet the latest packages\nsudo apt-get upgrade\nMake sure the driver switcher is installed\nsudo apt-get install jockey-common\nUpdate the driver database\nsudo jockey-text -u\nGet a list of all drivers available\nsudo jockey-text -m any -l\nInstall one, just wait.  It takes a bit and there's no feedback on progress.\nsudo jockey-text -e xorg:nvidia-current\nMake sure changes are written to disk\nsync\nCheck to see that it's installed but not active yet\nsudo jockey-text -m any -l\nRestart\nsudo init 6 \nYou should now get to a GUI on boot.  You can use the additional drivers tool(jockey-gtk) to disable the binary driver if you want and it will enable the noveau driver for you.  Or you can just leave it if you don't want to mess with it once it's working.\n\nThen the migration process should be straightforward.  It's documented here.\nAnd yes, if you migrate it will carry almost all of your settings and almost all of your files.  \n", "Q: Keyboard Layouts missing in Keyboard Layout --Precise upgrade This is from a bug I reported that never got a response. That was a 11.10 upgrade and now with a Precise upgrade, the issue continues with the Precise upgrade.\n\nSymptom\nI can't add alternative keyboard layouts.\nSteps to reproduce\n\n*\n\n*Go to Keyboard Layout\n\n*Press the + button\n\n*Nothing at all appears. That is, no selections to choose from.\n\nRealize the + button is faded, despite that the other buttons (- and others) light up.\nExpected results\nAlternative keyboard layouts should appear to choose from.\n\nThis is what I've done since then without results that stick.\nThinking that the problem is linked to the fact that I uninstalled other-than-English language support with BleachBit, I did the following:\n\n*\n\n*reinstalled language-selector-gnome\n\n*reinstalled language-pack-en-base\n\nI went back to Keyboard Layout and the + button is still faded.\nI even went so far as to add Spanish locale to see if I could add another layout, but this didn't make a difference. I can't add any layouts to the ones I already have installed (US alternative, US International, English Mac, and the International alt/Gr version).\nI tried the following:\ndpkg-reconfigure locales\nupdate-locale LANG=en_US.UTF-8\n\nAlthough it did seem to update my locale settings, when I went back to Keyboard Layout, the + button was still faded.\nI haven't tried dpkg-reconfigure localeconfig because this is not installed and apparently xkeyboard-config is an EOL.\nxkb-data looks promising from the description in the Software Center:\n\n\"This package contains configuration data used by the X Keyboard Extension (XKB), which allows selection of keyboard layouts when using a graphical interface.\"\n\nA quick wajig reinstall xkb-data proved my hopes wrong.\nIt seems the only thing that temporarily allowed me to install more layouts was sudo dpkg-reconfigure keyboard-configuration. I selected the colemak layout to see if it took. I ran it but by the time I rebooted, the change didn't stick.\nI just reinstalled iso-codes, and for a few minutes I saw that the keyboard applet showed  colemak I had installed previously with. I relogged back in and it was gone, but colemak shows in cat /etc/default/keyboard but not in Xorg. A quick Ctrl+Alt+F1 showed me that it did take, but only in console.\nXKBMODEL=\"pc104\"\nXKBLAYOUT=\"us\"\nXKBVARIANT=\"colemak\"\nXKBOPTIONS=\"terminate:ctrl_alt_bksp\"\n\nSomehow I don't think sudo dpkg-reconfigure keyboard-configuration was meant to (only?) change the console layout.\nI'm just reading /etc/default/keyboard and it says the following:\n# If you change any of the following variables and X is configured to\n# use this file, then the changes will become visible to X only if udev\n# is restarted.  You may need to reboot the system.\n\nI can assume that X is listening, at least until I reboot, when changes are thrown away. So, I assume there is a conflict between more than one file or sets of files as to which layouts take predominance.\nAny ideas anyone? This one has me stumped.\nOh, and I wonder if this Keyboard input method system menu selection under Language Support has anything to do with this. I would assume no.\nAside\nAnother solution, if I weren't already using my own .Xmodmap file would be to do something like sudo xmodmap /usr/share/xmodmap/xmodmap.uk.\n\nA: The Keyboard Layout window inexplicably won't allow you to choose more than 4 layouts. However, you can fire up gconf-editor and navigate to /desktop/gnome/peripherals/kbd/layouts and manually add as many layouts as you like.\nI don't understand the arbitrary limit in the GUI, though.\n", "Q: Is it safe to update an iPhone's firmware with VMWare? I would like to know if it's safe to update the firmware of my iPhone 4S through a Windows XP virtual machine created on VMWare Workstation 8 with forwarded USB.\nThanks.\n\nA: Short and simple answer:\n\nNo, it generally is not safe to upgrade firmwares through a virtual machine.\n\nHaving said that I have to admit that I have done firmware upgrades through a Virtual Box Windows guest (though not with an iPhone) without any problems. It may work fine in most cases. But as soon as the VM has proplems related to the virtualization you may end up with an incomplete firmware upgrade that may render your device unusuable. \nTherfore it is recommended and much safer to upgrade a firmware by using another machine running with the OS the upgrade software is designed for.\n", "Q: Unity 3d shows only wallpaper where as unity 2D works fine \nPossible Duplicate:\nUnity doesn't load, no Launcher, no Dash appears \n\nI just upgraded from ubuntu 11.10 to 12.04.

I cannot find anyway to login as root. I badly need help. I somehow want to get UNITY 3D running.\nAny advice would be appreciated.\n\nA: I found a workaround to my problem. The problem was with the Nvidia Driver current version (295.40). I had to rollback to the previous version and find out if I can login to Unity 3D. I downloaded the older version of Nvidia Driver (295.33) to Desktop.\nI restarted and logged into recovery mode. I selected the 'root' option and logged in as root. I installed the older Nvidia Driver (295.33) using following commandline \ncd Desktop \nsh ./NVIDIA FILE NAME.run\nI followed the onscreen instruction and installed the driver.

However Nitro uses GTK2 as it uses the pywebkitgtk library. As far as I'm aware, we can't use Quicklists because it requires PyGI which requires GTK3 and there is no pywebkitgtk for GTK3.\nIs there a way around this?\n\nA: There are two kinds of quicklist entries:\n\n\n*\n\n*Static: they only depend on static entries in the .desktop files\n\n*Dynamic: they can be created in the program itself and seem to require PyGI. \n\n\nSo for you there seem to be two ways around that: \n\n\n*\n\n*stick with static quicklists\n\n*write a separate server (very simple, really) that uses gtk3 /PyGI and acts as a bridge between nitro and the launcher.\n\n\nYou have to decide depending on your need, mainly on how much you need the dynamic part. But the second version really is not that hard to implement. \n\nA: Quicklists doesn't depend on GI or any other library.

When I tried to download ubuntu 32bit version is recommended, so I wonder if anything is wrong with 64 bit ubuntu for whatever reason.\n\nA: With FPGA development you're building a cross-compilation toolchain regardless(the Xilinx software), so it makes no difference.  64-bit is fine.  There is a case to be made for developing for i386 on i386 and not needing to cross-compile.  In this case, it's a moot point.\n\nA: There is absolutely nothing wrong with the 64-bit version of Ubuntu. I've been using it for years. The 64-bit version of Ubuntu can run 32-bit as well as 64-bit programs.\nThe reason the 32-bit version is recommended is because older computers might have a CPU that doesn't support 64-bit.

I've recently updated and found that Unity shows on the gnome-classic/fallback desktop. Is this a new feature (which I doubt to be), or a bug?

How can I make Firefox on Kubuntu to open PDF in its embedded PDF viewer, like it does on Windows? Currently it opens PDF's in Okular. Some websites (with embedded PDF's) malfunction because of this behavior.\n\nA: You can try installing PDF viewer addon in firefox\nHere is the link:\nhttps://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/pdfjs\n\nA: If you want to use the KDE viewer within Firefox, you can use the KParts plugin. To do this, install the kpartsplugin package. From the package description:\n\nThis software implements a plugin for Netscape-compatible browsers in Unix environments. This plugin uses KDE's KParts technology to embed file viewers (e.g. for PDF files) into non-KDE browsers. Tested browsers include both (Mozilla Firefox and Opera, and is know to work with Chrome and Arora. With this plugin, you can e.g. view PDF files in Firefox using Okular as an embedded plugin.\n\nHere I've opened a PDF document in Firefox using the embedded Okular KPart:\n\n", "Q: Unable to connect to https sites with wired connection I Have a problem only with https sites.\nTrying to access for example mail.google.com, after credentials, all browsers stay there waiting for response of https://accounts.google.com\nWith others https I have the same problem.\nThe problem is present only using the wired connection.

Im not sure but it may be caused by mis-configured proxies. Have you used any proxies or vpn ?\nIf you use firefox and any proxy addon then check whether it is disabled or not. Addons like - autoproxy,tor button,froxy proxy,anonymox etc can cause this type of problem.\nYou can manually check firefox network settings by edit->preferences->advanced->connection ->settings.\nIt also can caused by ssh client.

I wasn't happy with it and set it back to Default.\njeff@london:~ $ gconftool-2 --get /desktop/gnome/interface/gtk_key_theme\nDefault\njeff@london:~ $ \n\nBut chrome continues to interpret keybindings as emacs.  C-a goes to beginning of line rather than selecting all, C-k kills current line rather than beginning a web search, etc.\nI find plenty of references online on how to set emacs bindings, but removing them again is proving harder.  Any suggestions on what to look for?  (It is possible, of course, that I did something or that something happened beyond the gconftool-2 setting.)\n\nA: I've documented this in bug 985834.\nThe heart of the resolution is this:\n\nThis was not, in the end, a chromium-browser problem but a gnome problem. Oddly, gconftool showed the problem fixed when it wasn't. But gnome-tweak-tool showed the key bindings still to be emacs, and changing that back to Default fixed the problem immediately.\n\n\nA: Have you already tried using gconf-editor?\n", "Q: Installing applications from source I was wondering about generic installations of all applications in linux. And what that means? Well, when I was using windows I knew that if I want to install an application I am double-clicking the .exe file and then next,next,next.\nIn linux, I have understood that maybe there is a common (not generic) way to install any application. Installing from source maybe? Well is there any step by step method that can be used to install  application like in windows or not?\nI am asking because I do not want to keep asking the google, how to? So, I have managed to install recently from source freecad from this guide\nand I think that it would be a very nice start as common method, right?\nBut the thing then is where to find the right source and when an application has a very unique method of installation!\n\nA: FreeCAD is available in the Ubuntu Software Center, so it was not necessary to build and install it from source code.\nThe Ubuntu Software Center always the first place where you should look. Installing is just a matter of clicking a button.\nThere's an icon for the Ubuntu Software Center in the bar on the left side of the screen.\nIf you really want to build and install a program from source, then look for a README file or other instructions that come with the program.\nMany software packages use GNU autotools as the build system and can be built and installed with the following commands:\n./configure\nmake\nsudo make install\n\nBefore building a program you'll need to check what the required libraries and other dependencies are (that should also be mentioned in the documentation for the program). On packages.ubuntu.com you can find the Ubuntu packages that contain the required libraries.\nSuppose the program needs a library called blah, then you'll probably need to install the package libblah-dev (lookup the exact name on the Ubuntu Packages page I mentioned above).\nsudo apt-get install libblah-dev\n\n\nA: There are only two basic approaches:\n\n\n*\n\n*Use the Software Center or a related tool (Synaptic, apt-get, etc.). This is normally the best option. Going outside this method can lead to problems, such as conlficts and difficulties with updates, so you should only do something elseif you know what you're doing.\n\n*Read the documentation and use it to install. You might find it on the project's website, or in the tarball, or from the place you got your file. Or, there might be no documentation, in which case you have to Google or guess. There are very many different ways to install software. If this gets confusing, go back to number 1.\nIf your package uses the standard ./configure; make; sudo make install, you can use checkinstall to get a .deb of what you built. That way, you don't have to sacrifice package management.\n\nA: Installation instructions vary across programs although there are well-established tools like autotools (includes automake and autoconf) and cmake.\nSince programs can come in different programming languages, its hard to give generic commands that suit all packages. For example, Python often have setup.py scripts where C programs often use autotools or at least a Makefile.\nI always start with finding the INSTALL, README or similar files. If you need to compile a program from source, you likely need the build-essential package which depends on compilers and other generic development packages.\nDepending on the program you're trying to compile, you might need to install other dependencies. Check the README for that or the output of the ./configure script (an executable file located in the root of the extracted source). For example, if it says that you need \"x11 development headers\", try finding \"x11-dev\" or \"libx11-dev\" in the repositories (in this case, it's libx11-dev what you're looking for).\nSource distributions that were built with autoconf/automake can be extracted and configured with:\ntar xf foo-1.0.tar.gz\ncd foo-1.0\n./configure\nmake\nsudo make install\n\nUse ./configure --help for available options. By default, the files are often installed to /usr/local which is perfectly fine. Unless you're going to package the file into a .deb file, do not change this prefix to /usr as it may conflict with the package management system (dpkg).\nmake is supposed to start compiling everything where make install installs the files to the designated locations (sudo is necessary for writing to privileged locations like /usr/local). To uninstall it later, run from the source directory sudo make uninstall (providing that the package is properly build with autoconf/automake, which is a responsibility of the developer, not you, the user!\nIf you're just interested in compiling a package from the software center on your computer, proceed with (replace package and the version accordingly):\nsudo apt-get build-dep package\napt-get source package\ncd package-1.0\ndpkg-buildpackage -b -uc -us\n\nSee the respecxtive manual pages for more details on the commands. (e.g. run man dpkg-buildpackage in a terminal). After performing these commands, you'll have a .deb file in the parent directory. It's recommended to use the packages from Ubuntu repositories where possible. The above steps are shown for educational reasons, but generally you want to make a modification to some files before building the package.\n\nA: Installing from source is very difficult to support.  \nWhenever possible, install from software center.  That is the equivalent of the windows next->next->finish mentality.  \nYou can install things from source on windows too.  That's not unique to linux, it's just that more source available applications target linux.\n\nA: Ubuntu offers a variety of installation methods \n\n\n*\n\n*Via centralised packaging system \nThis is the preferd method in ubuntu (but personally I don't like it) \nsoftware-centre ,synaptic, and aptitude are examble for it\n\n*Standalone deb package:- This method is simpler as in the case of windows ,just double click the file and press install button\nEg:Gdebi package manager\n\n*binary software: these are very similar to windows .exe installation, It offers variety of gui for Installer, These are usually .bin files\nyou can use bit rock or similar tools to make such packaes\n\n*autopackage and similar tools :-these are third party package managers created to support various linux distros\n\n*source code:this is the first method in the software installation ,In this method  the source code is converted into the binary executables ,Installtions instructions for these softwares are usually attached with source code, And these are valid for open source s/w only\n\n\nWarning:-These are my observation only ,I am a newbie in linux ,So fell free to edit/downvote If there is anything wrong\n", "Q: I cannot save or print PDF/PS output when I create a document in Lyx I installed Lyx (Processor) from the Ubuntu Software centre (Precise).  It allows me to create and save  Lyx documents but only allows me to view the PDF/PS  rendition.  Is there an additional package I need to install to have this functionality?\n\nA: I finally discovered the answer to this question and for the sake of good housekeeping have answered my own question\nI resolved this by installing Document (PostScript, PDF) viewer (GTK+ version) (evence-gtk)\n", "Q: Remove close button on specific application I would like to remove the close button only on selected applications.\nIs it possible?\nMy expected result would be deactivating Skype's tray ugly-icon and removing the close button from his window, so i reduce to possibility to accidentally close the app.\n\nA: As far as I know, there isn't a way to do this.  The simplest option would be a tiny application that is just runs a transparent window and is set to always on top and not decorated.  Place this window on top of the anticipated location of your skype client.  \nYou could also replace the icon.\n", "Q: First nautilus instance not showing / mounting (removable) devices in places pane Since a number of weeks I am having a strange issue with nautilus. Before when I inserted a CD, I would be prompted for an action, if I inserted a USB stick it would be automatically mounted and shown and disk partitions that were not automatically mounted at boot time were shown under Devices in the Places pane.\nThen a number of weeks ago this just stopped working, I have a hunch that this happened when I created an additional account that was activated for automatic login for a while.\nI have found out that when I just kill the initial nautilus -n instance started by gnome-session and then restart it from the desktop it will show the available devices (like an inserted CD) and I can then mount them by clicking. (Alternatively I can logout from the desktop and back on again). Still, this is pretty annoying to have to do time and again.\nYes I know about the configuration settings that have to do with this and yes the automount settings are activated.\nI thought that there was maybe a relationship with the automatic logon but that appears not to be the case, if I disable that nautilus is still failing to show the devices the first time I login but showing them after logging out and back in again.\nThis is Ubuntu 11.10 32 bit, fully updated.\n\nA: I now believe this issue is caused by gdu-notification-daemon crashing, which is a known bug (#932662).\n", "Q: not able to create boot partition in grub after resizing ubuntu partition I booted from the live cd so that I could increase disk space and swap space of my ubuntu partition.

My intention was to set boot flag on the unallocatted space of 1.85 GB.\n\nA: Ok, i had the exact same problem at least 9-10 times each time i formatted my /home partition and the windows partition later.What i do every time is this:\n\n\n*\n\n*mount the ubuntu live cd and try ubuntu\n\n*open terminal\n\n*sudo fdisk -l (that gives a list of partition)\n\n*sudo mount /dev/sdanumber_0f_disk_you_have_installed_the_ubuntu /mnt\nfor example sudo mount /dev/sda2 /mnt\n\n\nlets say number_0f_disk_you_have_installed_the_ubuntu=X \n\n\n*\n\n*sudo mount /dev/sdaX /mnt/boot\n\n*sudo mount --bind /dev /mnt/dev/\n\n*sudo chroot /mnt\n\n*grub-install /dev/sda\n\n*sudo umount /mnt/dev\n\n*sudo umount /mnt\n\n*sudo reboot\n\n\nA: You do not need a separate \"boot partition\" in order to boot Ubuntu - it was working just fine before, wasn't it?\nWhat I suspect happened is that you moved the start of your Ubuntu partition which broke your bootloader. You need to reinstall GRUB, actually, gparted should've warned you.\nhttp://gparted.sourceforge.net/faq.php#faq-13\nYou may also need to set \"boot\" flag on /dev/sda5\n", "Q: Unity 3D Launcher Color/Transparency with MyUnity 3.0 I have Ubuntu 12.04 LTS beta.

If not set you can do so with\nsudo zfs set mountpoint=/foo_mount data\n\nThat will make zfs mount your data pool in to a designated foo_mount point of your choice.\nAfter that is done and since root owns the mount point you can change the owner of the mount with\nsudo chown -R user:user /foo_mount\n\nThat will make the user user and the group user own the mount point and everything inside it, adjust the command to assign correct user:group privileges to the mount point.\n\nA: I had a similar problem and, indeed, canmount was on but the pool+dataset didn't mount on boot nor when going online, etc.\nMy solution, after zpool import and zpool online the pool, was:\n\n\n*\n\n*zfs mount poolname\n\n*zfs mount poolname/datasetname\nYes, zfs instead of zpool with the poolname and then poolname/datasetname. \nHope this help someone.\n", "Q: Why does Ubuntu's default screenshot app not work properly? Let's say that I click on the screenshot app that comes bundled with Ubuntu 11.10, and then select \"select area to grab\" followed by drawing the desired area, the resulting screenshot that is captured is, too often, coated with an Ubuntu-coloured glaze. \nFor example, if I screencap this Ask Ubuntu website, the white areas (all area, in fact) will come out with an orange hue. I'll cancel and repeat the process until the result is correct.\nDoes my description help? If so, then any idea why it happens and how to fix it?\n\nA: It sounds like you're seeing a race condition between the application redrawing after the orange selection mask is applied and the screen contents being captured.  So I would suggest filing a bug report.  Remember to say what desktop you're running (Unity 2D, Unity 3D, Gnome 3, etc) since the compositing features could affect the behaviour.\nOne work around would be to use one of the other two modes (whole screen or whole window), and crop the result with an image editor like Gimp afterwards.  Since these modes do not involve you masking an area of the screen first, you shouldn't run into this problem.\n\nA: Not sure how this happened but my prtSc button was no longer taking screenshots  but when I went to Settings>Keyboard>Application Shortcuts and reset to defaults it worked for me\nGnome 3.4.2\n", "Q: Why not permit read access for all in /var/log? There are many log files in /var/log that I do not have permission to read with my normal user.  I have to use sudo to add read permission first.  It's getting annoying, especially having to repeat the same thing on different machines.  \nIs there a good reason for this?\n\nA: The /var/log files contain logged data, http://tldp.org/LDP/Linux-Filesystem-Hierarchy/html/var.html , important to note-\n\"/var/log/wtmp, which logs all logins and logouts into the system\"\n\"/var/log/messages, where all kernel and system program message are usually stored\"\nThese areas contain tons of detailed information about your system, and if even read by an outside service, could be used to compromise your whole system. I would advise not to change the permissions on this folder.\n\nA: The permissions are set like this for security purposes on servers and production machines. If you are just using a personal desktop or laptop that's not hosting anything to the outside world, then it probably doesn't matter.\nIf you feel like diddling with the permissions, then you can always try a chmod -R 666 on the log directory, although I'm not sure if this will break anything when it comes to the log writers needing specific permissions on the files, or if the permissions will not change when the logging software decides to change the logs. However, I still think the best way to view the files is with a\nsudo less filename\nIt's only one little extra sudo.\n", "Q: Create a partition in virtual machine! I want to create a partition in virtual machine Ubuntu 11.10 32 bit so that I can test a few things.\nI use a guide for something I want to do and it says that I should create a partition in my system but I do not want to have a partition in my main system so I think that I can install Ubuntu 11.10 32 bit on virtual machine, then create a partition in virtual disk, is it possible?\n\nA: Creating a virtual machine to test things is a briliant idea, I wish more people would do that instead of corrupting their main install. If it is possible for your use case, most probably YES, but you're not being very specific. If you know you want an extra partition on forehand, you can create it during install of the VM. VirtualBox is a good application for running VM's and it is in the standard repositories.\nThe fun about virtual machines is that you can completely mess up things inside a VM, while your host OS stays up running stable. Worst case scenario is that it runs somewhat slower because the VM is using a lot of CPU or (disk) IO.\nPersonally I always have a few VM's installed, just to test things.\nIn many modern PC's you can enable VT-x or AMD-V extensions, which will dramatically improve performance of virtual machines. Refer to the manual of your motherboard for this.\n\nA: When you create a virtual machine using software as Parallels, VirtualBox or VmWare you will be asked to assign a disk to that machine, you can use either a physical read drive or create a virtual disk.\nA virtual disk is nothing but a file that resides in your host computer that is mounted as a drive and can be used as a drive in you guest computer.\nIf you boot from the Ubuntu CD inside a virtual machine that is using a virtual disk all the operation on that disk will be done to the file pretending to be your disk and no actual changes will be do to the host system's drive.\nOnce you created the virtual machine in your virtualization software you can check if indeed you are going to use a virtual disk in the machine properties\n\nAnything you do to that virtual disk will not affect your host system, its just a dummy disk that uses a mounted file as a disk. Feel free to do whatever you want to that virtual disk.\n\nA: It most certainly is.\nIf it's you're first time playing around with a virtual machine than I suggest you use virltualbox. It's very straightforward and has a nice wizard for when you make a virtual machine. At a certain point in the wizard, you will be asked to create a virtual disk. I suggest you use the virtualbox VDI format with dynamically expanding storage. Basically you will be left with a file on your disk that is used by virtualbox as the virtual HDD. Once you boot the vm, you can then partition this virtual disk from inside the vm with whatever operating system you decide to install.\n", "Q: How to stick an icon on the menu bar?

I put it in and installed Ubuntu on it, using a CD. Everything went fine, didn't have to setup any special Apple stuff, didn't need to bless my partition, make an EFI partition, etc. Everything was done for me.)\nRecently, I found out that my DVD drive broke.\nI want to install Windows 8 Consumer Preview onto my MacBook, next to the Ubuntu install, preferrably using GRUB to chainload the Windows 8 bootloader. However, since my DVD drive is broken, the only way for me to install it is to use a USB drive.\nI tried making a bootable USB stick for my MacBook, but without luck. I can't seem to be able to get the Windows 8 setup on it.\nI also tried installing it via a rawdisk image in VirtualBox (directly to a partition, so I'm also making sure my bootloader doesn't get overwritten, which Windows usually does), but I don't have enough RAM to do that I'm afraid.\nSo my question is: how do I make a bootable USB drive for my MacBook so I can install Windows 8? And when that works, how do I get my GRUB back? (if Windows overwrites it)\nFor people not familiar with how Apple computers boot operating systems: New Apple computers use EFI, a newer computer firmware to replace the old BIOS. This and some limitations (put in by Apple), some of which are explained here, make it difficult to make a bootable USB drive.\nI have another computer with Windows 7 and Ubuntu.\n\nA: Step 1: Download and install Microsoft’s Windows 7 USB/DVD Download Tool [Microsoft Store Link]\nStep 2: Download Windows 8 Developer Preview from Windows Dev Center. If you don’t know if your processor is 32-bit or 64-bit ready, download the 32-bit .iso file.\nStep 3: Insert a USB flash drive having 8GB or greater storage capacity in a USB port on your computer.\nStep 4: Launch Windows 7 USB/DVD Download Tool you installed in Step 1.\nStep 5: Choose the ISO file you downloaded in Step 2 by clicking on “Browse”.\nStep 6: Click on “USB device” when prompted to choose media type. In the next step, choose your inserted USB flash drive.\nStep 7: The tool will now create a bootable USB flash drive using the Windows 8 DP .iso. This will take some time, so be patient.\nStep 8: Once the tool has done its thing, restart your PC with the USB plugged in. On start up, you will need to enter the BIOS utility of your computer and boot from the USB. \nStep 9: Once booted from the USB drive; follow on-screen instructions to install Windows 8 DP.\nFinally the grub recovery is covered here: How can I repair grub? (How to get Ubuntu back after installing Windows?) . \nReference: 1.\n\nA: Sometimes the best is the simplest, it turns out that Windows 8 comes the boot files to boot on UEFI which boots perfecly on the Macbook and using the ISO tool doesn't preserve this (tested on my MacBook). To run it on the Mac with usb, there is a list of simple commands which you can run on your Windows 7 PC to transfer the files to your USB drive. Turns out the \"To Go\" version was a dead end for your situation, because formating the \"To Go\" USB that had UEFI, required a command that needed to be run in Windows 8 (talk about a catch 22) Source - 1 \nSo all you need to do to make your USB is to run these commands in the Windows Command Prompt aka cmd. (I'm sure these commands should have an equivalent in Linux, does anyone have ideas for futrue reference?)\n1- Download Windows 8 select the right version (32-bits or 64-bits) for your MacBook, here is a list of MacBooks that support 64-bits operating systems: Macs that work with 64-bit editions of Microsoft Windows. (Don't worry, we are not using Bootcamp, but the list is nice to see if you can run the 64-bits version.)\n2- Insert your USB drive and run the following commands in the Windows command prompt, one line for each command.\n\ndiskpart (Start the Windows disk management command line tool.)\nlist disk (This command will list all disks.)\nYou'll be able to use this command to search for your USB drive's number ('Disk ###'). You should be able to tell what's the right one by its size, but be careful, as the following commands will erase all contents currently on the drive.\nselect disk ### (Replace ### with your 'Disk ###' This is 5 in my example, so it will be \"select disk 5\" for me.)\nclean (This will remove the partitioning information currently on the disk, effectively 'removing' all data on the disk.)\ncreate partition primary (This will create a new partition.)\nselect partition 1 (This will select the partition so it can be used by following commands.)\nactive (Will make the newly created partition active.)\nformat quick fs=fat32 (UEFI can only USB boot to FAT32, not NTFS.)\nassign (This will mount the USB drive.)\nexit (This will leave the 'diskpart' program.)\nLooks kindof like this but make sure to format in fat32 unlike I did in my picture\n\n3- Download and install Virtual CloneDrive this is and iso emulation program, run the program and change the settings to these-\n\nThis will set up a virtual drive so we can mount the Windows 8 ISO file, and speedily transfer to the USB drive. So now we want to navigate to \"Computer\" to see your new \"BD-ROM\" dive. Right click on it and select \"Virtual CloneDrive\", then \"Mount\", as shown below-\n\nNext navigate to where you saved your Windows 8 ISO file, select it and click Open.\n4- Now we need to copy the files over, use the following command (reopen command prompt like you did before) switching \"A\" out for the drive letter of your mounded Windows 8 virtual drive, and \"B\" out for the letter of your USB drive.\nxcopy A:\\* B:\\ /s /e\n\n5- Once that is done, eject the USB, put the USB in your Mac, turn the mac on while holding the alt/option key and you should see a yellow USB drive icon labeled \"efi\".

I can cause nice juddering drops in charge rate by quickly switching between desktops.\n\nA: You can see the current discharge rate of your battery without any additional tools. Open a terminal with Ctrl+Alt+T and enter this:\nls /proc/acpi\n\nThis gives you something like this:\nBAT1\n\nNow enter this command, substituting BAT1 if necessary:\ncat /proc/acpi/battery/BAT1/state\n\nYou will get output similar to this:\npresent:                 yes\ncapacity state:          ok\ncharging state:          charged\npresent rate:            0 mA\nremaining capacity:      3395 mAh\npresent voltage:         12393 mV\n\nThe present rate line is what your looking for (my PSU is plugged in right now, so the discharge rate is zero).\nIf you want to see how the rate changes, e.g. per second, do this:\nwatch -n 1 cat /proc/acpi/battery/BAT1/state\n\nThis gives your the output from above, but refreshed every 1 second. Terminate with Ctrl+c.\n\nA: Type sudo powertop in the terminal.\n", "Q: Gnome Shell keeps falling back to classic desktop when trying to enable it on an Optimus laptop I have installed Ubuntu 12.04 beta, and after installing the gnome-shell each time before i log in, when I select Gnome desktop, I get the gnome backfall (classic) desktop.\nI also noticed that I cannot enable compiz, (I could with the 10.10 version), I dont know if it has something to do with the drivers.\nI have a intel i3 processor\n\nA: If you are using an optimus based laptop, going to the Ubuntu Software Center and removing the \"NVidia binary X.Org driver ('current' driver)\" may solve the problem.\n\nA: I managed to fix this issue installing bumblebee, after the restart everything is working correctly, Shell & Compiz on Gnome Classic\nsudo apt-add-repository ppa:mj-casalogic/bumblebee\nsudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install bumblebee\n\n", "Q: Is there a way to reset smbclient settings to the default? I think i made a few bugs in config settings of smb.conf and i want to get my original network settings back..is there any way for that?\n\nA: If you want to get your edited smb.conf back and didn't backup before I fear there is no possibility. You can take a look at /etc/samba and watch for files like \"smb.conf~\", \"smb.conf.bak\" or something like this ...\nAn example smb.conf is to find at /usr/share/samba/. Replace your misconfigured file by\nsudo cp /usr/share/samba/smb.conf /etc/samba/smb.conf\nsudo initctl restart smbd\n\nAnd from now backup your files before editing:\nsudo cp /etc/samba/smb.conf /etc/samba/smb.conf.backup_120418\n\nor something like this.\n", "Q: Can I use  the PHP DOTNET function?

I have never used it before so it is very new to me. \nI have burned 2 discs with different isos and both didn't even get to the installer. First time i saw the installer was with unetbootin and the it showed some error about my cdrom not being able to unmount. I even bought a 4gb usb to install with livelinux and that gave me the same error. My old laptop has an intel 945 motherboard. Please help.\n\nA: Have you tried the standard USB installation instructions mentioned on the Ubuntu website?\nIf that doesn't work on your laptop. Try it on any other machine you have access to. That could help determine whether the problem is with your laptop or the installation media.\n\nA: I believe that the laptop is not very compatible with 11.10, because the unity interface and some of its background apps take a lot of memory and cpu usage that the whole hardware could be slowed down and not able to even load up live cd, which in this case cds and usb sticks are useless. The only thing to the solution, i would recommend to install 10.04 and go with that. If you research for how to upgrade to the software that is on the 11.10, i can assure u that u will go fine with 10.04. \n", "Q: Removing a tree CODE EDIT \nSo now that I'm off work I can do a little coding in my free time.\nThe way that I think I want this to work is take a tarball (what I\nwould normally extract to a folder anyway) and compare that to our\nworking directory.

Note: I wasn't sure whether to put this question here, or on Apple.SE, so If you think it would be better served there, feel free to migrate it, Although I thought that because it was primarily about the mounting of the drive on Ubuntu, it was more appropriate to ask here.\n\nI recently bought an apple tv. I wanted to see what exactly was inside, So I tried mounting it as a device in ubuntu. When I did it, there were 2 devices that were listed: \"Apple Tv\", and \"Documents on Apple Tv\"\nThe \"Apple Tv\" drive worked fine, but when I tried opening \"Documents on apple tv\", I got the following error message:\nError: unhandled lockdown error (-256)\n\nwhy is this happening? What do I have to do to get it to mount properly?\n\nA: May be the problem is that apple tv uses IOS 5, in this case you have to install the lib to could mount the tv.\nI could try installing the next lib:\nsudo apt-get install ifuse libimobiledevice-utils\nthen try this comand:\nidevicepair unpair && idevicepair pair\nnow try again!\n", "Q: /etc/apt/apt.conf gets cleared every time I change proxy settings under settings->network->Network proxy I use a proxy server settings at work but when i get home, my network connection uses no proxy settings. \nevery time i get home and use the proxy settings under settings->networks->Network Proxy to set to \"none\", the file /etc/apt/apt.conf gets cleared and the following day in the morning i have to edit the file and type in the command again, or at least copy paste from a backup file. \nHow can i avoid this situation, its tiring, how can i make the proxy settings gui write to this file for apt-get and software center to work when i set proxy under network settings?\n\nA: You could put the proxy configuration in /etc/apt/apt.conf.d/70proxy.conf, create this file and put your proxy config in there.\nAcquire::http::Proxy \"http://whatever:port\";\n\nThen when you get home, you can just rename that file. Note that only files ending in .conf (or files with no extension) will be considered by apt, so you can potentially just rename it to /etc/apt/apt.conf.d/70proxy.disabled and it will not be considered.\nYou can then automate it with stuff like this, you can create a .bash_aliases file in your home directory and put this in it:\nexport APT_PROXY_BASE=/etc/apt/apt.conf.d/70proxy\nalias enable-proxy=\"[ -f ${APT_PROXY_BASE}.disabled ] && sudo mv ${APT_PROXY_BASE}.disabled ${APT_PROXY_BASE}.conf\"\nalias disable-proxy=\"[ -f ${APT_PROXY_BASE}.conf ] && sudo mv ${APT_PROXY_BASE}.conf ${APT_PROXY_BASE}.disabled\"\n\nTo enable the proxy, just issue\nenable-proxy\n\nand to disable:\ndisable-proxy\n\nBeware, I didn't test it :) it's just meant to get you on the right track.\n\nA: In Ubuntu 12.04 LTS:\nWhen you come home, try not applying no-proxy system-wide. This doesn't edit the apt.conf file, yet software center uses no proxy. Works for me, dunno how.\n", "Q: Tool to transform webmail to imap I have a problem. I work for a company that only provides webmail for users (admins tell it is for security blabla, i have no influence on that) Since I receive a lot of mails working with webmail is very uncomfortable. Therefore I would like to know if any of you is aware of a kind of gateway that would allow me to use an imap client (mutt in my case) to connect to that webinterface. This kind of gateway certainly exists.

Both upgrades seem to have worked, but now my terminal acts differently, particularly concerning output scrolling. I am accessing this server via Terminal on a 11.10 Desktop (GNOME fallback).\n10.10 Behavior:\n\n\n*\n\n*A scroll bar is displayed on the right side of my Terminal, allowing me to scroll back to older output\n\n*Turning the mouse wheel scrolls back to older output\n\n\n11.10 Behavior:\n\n\n*\n\n*No scroll bar is visible\n\n*Turning the mouse wheel cycles the current line through my command history (same as UP key)\n\n\nThis is a difficult issue to describe succinctly and I've had no luck finding any information about this. But I've performed the same upgrade several times (10.10->11.10) and the result is always the same concerning Terminal scrolling. Output scrolling is very important to me and something I take for granted - I'm concerned I'll be unable to work effectively on this server until I resolve this.\nUpdate - Problem magically gone after logout/login\nWell, as I said I've done the same upgrade several times and encountered the same problem. However, in the previous tries I was scared away and gave up. This time I was more determined to finish the upgrade and by simply logging out and back in to the server via SSH the problem has corrected itself.\n\nA: Just reset alone worked for me.\n\nA: If tput rmcup does not work, try\ntput reset\n\ninstead.\n\nA: The behaviour you describe sounds like your terminal was stuck in the full screen \"cursor addressing\" mode used by tools like less and vi.\nThe mode can become stuck if those programs do not exit cleanly.  For instance, if you kill -9 them, or are running them through an ssh session that disconnects.  You can exit this terminal mode by running the following command:\ntput rmcup\n\nOr just try browsing a file with less and quit as normal.  You should then have access to your scrollback and the contents of the screen when cursor addressing mode was entered.\n", "Q: Custom package is uninstallable I have a custom package I've built, python-amqplib, which relies on python >= 2.5.

This could be done, for example, using the sshfs options:\nuid=$(id -u),gid=$(id -g)\n\nor\nuid=$(id -u someuser),gid=$(id -g somegroup)\n\nSee https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/SSHFS#Secure_user_access for more details.\n", "Q: Problem upgrading 11.04 I've been trying to upgrade my ubuntu 11.04 desktop computer, but when I click on the ugrade button:\n\nI get this error:\nI've tryied to change my repositories, but it changes nothing in the error((on the \"setting new software channel\").\n\nCan someone point me in the right direction?\nThis is my sources.list:\n# deb http://ppa.launchpad.net/ailurus/ppa/ubuntu karmic main # disabled on upgrade to karmic\n# deb-src http://ppa.launchpad.net/ailurus/ppa/ubuntu karmic main # disabled on upgrade to karmic\n\n# deb cdrom:[Ubuntu 9.04 _Jaunty Jackalope_ - Release i386 (20090421.3)]/ jaunty main restricted\n# See http://help.ubuntu.com/community/UpgradeNotes for how to upgrade to\n# newer versions of the distribution.\n\ndeb http://us.archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/ natty main restricted multiverse universe\n\n## Major bug fix updates produced after the final release of the\n## distribution. deb http://us.archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/ natty-updates main restricted multiverse universe\n\n## N.B. software from this repository is ENTIRELY UNSUPPORTED by the Ubuntu\n## team.

I use EncFS with Cryptkeeper to manage my encrypted folders (containing personal data files, bank, scans ...).\nI would like to encrypt a folder on my NAS Synology but even when I have my NAS folder mounted on Ubuntu I cannot create an encrypted folder with cryptkeeper because the NAS isn't visible: I only have the local folders.\nIf someone have the solution, I would like to avoid the commande line, but maybe I can create a specific launcher for the folder? I would prefer Cryptkeeper.\nThx in advance.\nD.\n\nA: I think it should work if you'd add your NAS to /etc/fstab to have it permanently mounted.\n\nIn my case I added a drive connected to a Fritz!Box:\nOpen your NAS in Nautilus. Press Ctrl+L and copy the place without prefix(?), in my case //fritz.box/fritz.nas/WD-10EAVSExternal-01:\n\nCreate a place which should link to your NAS, i. e. /media/fritzbox:\nsudo mkdir /media/fritzbox\n\nEdit /etc/fstab:\ngksu /etc/fstab\n\nand add following line - adjusted to your settings:\n# fritzbox\n//fritz.box/fritz.nas/WD-10EAVSExternal-01  /media/fritzbox cifs    guest,defaults  0   0\n\nFinish with mounting:\nsudo mount -a\n\n\nThen you should be able to see the NAS in Cryptkeeper, at least it works here.\n\nA: Here's the steps I use:\n\n\n*\n\n*Create the EncFS folders locally with CryptKeeper, ie .MyVault_encfs on the\ndesktop. \n\n*Delete the folder from CryptKeeper but don't delete permanently delete the data.\n\n*Move this folder to the desired location on the NAS\n\n*Import the EncFS folder in CryptKeeper via the gvfs folder, ie ~/.gvfs/myshare on myserver/.MyVault_encfs. Your mount point must be outside the ~/.gvfs folder, such as ~/CryptKeeper-NAS/MyVault. This is why we cannot create the CryptKeeper folder directly in the ~/.gvfs folder.  Also, please note that on 12.04 beta the folder is currently ~/.cache/gvfs but will likely be moved back.\n\n\nThe share will of course need to be mounted before the CryptKeeper folder.\n", "Q: What is the keyboard shortcut to minimise a window to launcher in unity? In 10.10 that I was using before 12.04, you could use Alt+F9 to minimize a window to the task bar. \nIn 12.04 Meta+Ctrl+↑/↓ maximizes and unmaximizes a window.\nIf you have a numeric keypad you can use Ctrl+Alt+0 to minimize to launcher. \nOn my netbook I don't have a numeric keypad and the normal numbers do not work with the above shortcut. How can I minimize windows with a keyboard shortcut?\n\nA: If your keyboard has 'windows' key, also known as 'Super' in Ubuntu, you can minimize, maximize, left-restore or right-restore using the key combinations:\n\n\n*\n\n*Ctrl + Super + Up arrow = Maximize or Restore (toggles)\n\n*Ctrl + Super + Down arrow = Restore then Minimize \n\n*Ctrl + Super + Left arrow = Restore to left \n\n*Ctrl + Super + Right arrow = Restore to right\n\n\nA: If you wish to continue to use Alt+F9 then you can. For unity* just set to it in system settings > keyboard > shortcuts > windows  as seen in the screenshot in aking1012's answer\nFor gnome-shell you need to set in gsettings, either graphically in dconf-editor as in screen or thru gsettings\ngsettings set org.gnome.desktop.wm.keybindings minimize \"['<Alt>F9']\"\n\n\n\nA: I prefer the default bindings instead of needing customised ones:\n\n*\n\n*Alt+Space then pressing N to Minimize\n\n*Alt+Space then pressing X to Maximize/Un-maximize\n\nThis also happens to be the default in Microsoft Windows.\nUnfortunately it's different for GNOME Shell. There you press:\n\n*\n\n*Super+Up to Maximize\n\n*Super+Down to Un-maximize\n\n*Alt+Space + Space to minimize a menu\n\n\nA: Launch keyboard:\n\nShortcuts, windows, minimize window, click at the right of the bar as indicated\n\nIt will toggle to new accelerator.  Just press CTL + ALT + 0 not the numpad zero.  \nDo note that the numpad zero shortcut will no longer work after you do this. Shortcuts now make a distinction between numpad numbers and across the top numbers, although it isn't noted as 'numpad0' in the keyboard wizard.  \n", "Q: How to automount my Windows partition at boot? I have a dual boot Windows 7, Ubuntu 11.10 system.\nUbuntu was pretty much a vanilla installation and it was able to automount my two Win partitions.\nI used to see them in Nautilus.

Also, there are three connection methods to the internet, two WiFi APs and a wired connection.  This problem occurs on all three.\nSkype seems to work, having no problems connecting to its network.\nThis Lenovo S12 (Intel atom) laptop does not seem to play nice with Linux/Ubuntu as several custom work-arounds are required to get Ubuntu working ⋯ e.g. needing WiCd because Network Manager does not work.  More here, here, here, and here.\n\nA: I'm having the same issue. I've found that if I disconnect and reconnect to my wifi network, or if I reboot the machine, I can get one or two webpages to load, but then DNS stops working again. For the record, just because you can ping by IP, that doesn't mean that DNS is working. DNS is the service that turns names into IP addresses.  Something odd that I did notice though, if I tether my laptop to my phone, internet works perfectly without a hitch. However, my home wifi network doesn't work for more than one webpage with Ubuntu even though it works with every other computer and device in the house. \n\nA: Unfortunately this is another \"not an answer\". It is just a problem isolation suggestion.\nYou've already confirmed via ping that IP networking appears to be working correctly on your laptop. The next thing I would try is using someone else's DNS servers. I do not know why the default DNS servers provided by an ISP sometimes tend to flake out, just that they appear to do so.\nThe most common \"other\" DNS servers to try are Google's public DNS and/or OpenDNS. Since both are free, why not try both? :-) Below are the IP addresses you can use and a suggested terminal command to test them with. (dig (domain information groper) was suggested in this answer).\nGoogle Public DNS (Domain Name System)\n    8.8.8.8\n    8.8.4.4\n\nOpenDNS\n    208.67.222.222\n    208.67.220.220\n\nirrational@VBubu04-21daily:~$ dig  www.askubuntu.com @208.67.220.220\n\n; <<>> DiG 9.8.1-P1 <<>> www.askubuntu.com @208.67.220.220\n;; global options: +cmd\n;; Got answer:\n;; ->>HEADER<<- opcode: QUERY, status: NOERROR, id: 56386\n;; flags: qr rd ra; QUERY: 1, ANSWER: 1, AUTHORITY: 0, ADDITIONAL: 0\n\n;; QUESTION SECTION:\n;www.askubuntu.com.

The default nameserver in your system turns out to be your router, i.e. /etc/resolv.conf == nameserver 192.168.0.1. In other words, your router is playing the role of a DNS server. \nYour systems send their DNS requests to your router and it forwards them on to whatever DNS the router is set up to use. The router should then forward any response returned from the DNS server to the system on your LAN which originally sent the DNS request.\nI suppose whether or not this is a good thing depends on how you look at it. Being cynical, I tend to view this as adding yet another, unneeded middleman who could cluck things up to the processing. So I don't do this. Instead I configure my router to provide the IP addresses for the Google and/or OpenDNS DNS servers to any system on my LAN as part of its DHCP response.\nThe method to do this probably varies depending on the router's manufacturer. I have a D-Link 655 and the steps I have to follow are:\n\n\n*\n\n*Log on to my router as admin.\n\n*Disable the DNS Relay checkbox in the Network Settings > Router Settings section of my router's setup.\n\n*Add the DNS IP addresses to supply via DHCP to the WAN (Internet) > DHCP section of my router's setup.\n\n\nRebooting your router is probably the quickest way to see if your router might part of the problem you're having. If it is ... or even if it isn't :-) ... you might consider the change suggested above.\n\nA: Resolution discovered.\n/etc/resolv.conf is being deleted.  How or why is undetermined.\nIt may be due to the fact that changing DNS in WiCd does not result in resolv.conf being changed.\nThanks to all for the suggestions.\n\nA: Same problem, router and local DNS addresses were OK but I could only access websites directly through IP addressing.\nSomehow /etc/resolv.conf was patched and the first (of 3) nameservers had an IPv6 address while my internet-provider does not offer IPv6 yet. After deleting the IPv6 address the issue was solved.\n\nA: I had something similar  happen on a Mint laptop. I came to this and similar questions through a search on \"DNS stopped working\". My wired connection was perfectly fine and the wifi connection sorta worked except for DNS. And even DNS worked sometimes. \nI tried a lot of suggestions with no luck.

It turns out my original suggestion was wrong and did not work as I thought it would. :-(\nSo ... starting over ... \nWhile I intend to experiment more with a VM to learn more about the various tools such as the Boot-Repair tool or using a Live CD and chroot and to reinstall GRUB, I figured the most expedient thing I could offer now would be to sketch out one way to allow booting from Windows into the GRUB menu.\nI am not suggesting this as \"the\" final solution. But it should at least enable booting up the Ubuntu partition again which also, I think, opens up other repair options.\nAlso, having tried it on the VM, I have some confidence that this should work. (Mentally crossing fingers here ...)\nUsing EasyBCD 2.1.2 to Boot to GRUB from Windows Boot Menu\n\n\n*\n\n*Start up Windows. Then open the EasyBCD 2.1.2 page in a browser and use the Download free for limited, non-commercial use link to download and install EasyBCD.\nNote: This link is underneath the Buy Now button towards the bottom of the page.\nWhile they prompt for a name & email, you are not required to enter them to do the download.\n\n*Open the EasyBCD program and select Add New Entry from the sidebar on the left. \n\n*Select the rightmost tab, NeoGrub, under \"Operating Systems\" and click the Install button.\nNote:  This adds the NeoGrub bootloader code to your C:\\ directory.\nYou should see the file NeoGrub and the directory NST in C:\\ if the install worked correctly.\n\n*Select the Linux/BSD tab. Choose the type of GRUB your install uses (e.g. GRUB 2) and, optionally, edit the name of the\n  entry you are about to add to the Windows Boot menu.\n\n*Click the Add Entry button to add an entry to boot Linux (GRUB menu) to the Windows boot menu.\n\n*Select Edit Boot Menu from the sidebar to review your changes.\nNote: You can delete the entry for NeoGrub Bootloader if you wish.\nIt was added when you installed the NeoGrub Bootloader in step (3). You need the bootloader but you do not need a boot menu entry for it. You only need the entry added in step (5).\n\n*Save your changes and reboot. When the Windows boot menu appears, select the entry you added to boot Linux. After a slight delay the GNU GRUB boot menu should appear.\n\n\nA: Boot into the live CD and try these commands (only if you already have Ubuntu installed). This is for Grub2.\nYou will need to find your partition with ubuntu on it and replace /dev/sdAX. This can be done with the following command sudo fdisk -l - and then choose the partition 'Linux'\nsudo su\nmkdir /mnt/root\nmount -t ext4 /dev/sdAX /mnt/root\nmount -t proc none /mnt/root/proc\nmount -o bind /dev /mnt/root/dev\nmount -o bind /sys /mnt/root/sys\nchroot /mnt/root /bin/bash\nsudo grub-install /dev/sda\nsudo update-grub\n\n", "Q: How do I install Photoshop CS5 Extended from the CD? I'm quite new (or brand new) to Ubuntu. \nI want to install my Adobe Photoshop CS5 Extended. I have purchased a licensed copy. \nI downloaded WINE and ran the start up through that. Everything ran smoothly until it actually started installing. It barely starts and I get an error message from the  installation screen from Adobe Photoshop. Can anyone help?\n\nA: Check out Wine's AppDB entry for Photoshop CS5\nIn the \"Installs?\" column it says \"No, but has a workaround\". Below you'll find some detailed instructions - try following them and see if it helps.\n", "Q: Temporary Admin Status for System Maintenance on User Account I have a user account that I have given sudo privileges on my computer. I use this account for everyday use and system maintenance.\nI know it isn't a good idea to give sudo permissions to an everyday account. Is there some way to get admin privileges temporarily when I want to do system maintenance, or should I really be using two user accounts?\n\nA: I believe it is possible to change your sudo password so it is different from your login, but I don't know how much it will help. Maybe a better option would be to limit the types of commands you can use sudo with. I know that is possible, look into the sudoers file for a listing of what users can use sudo with which commands\n", "Q: Wireless is disabled by hardware switch on a Dell Latitude I have the same problem in 11.10, and it occured just before I installed 12.04, thought by remove and complete install 12.04 the problem wolud be gone , but no still there also in 12.04\ni have a dell latitude with a intel 5100 wireless \nit was working perfect before , dont know what happend or what i did \n..........\nalso the sudo commands where do you enter those , by alt f2 ?? or in the bios ??\n\nA: Here's your laptop's User Manual: \n\n\n*\n\n*http://support.dell.com/support/edocs/systems/late5400/en/qrg/qrg_en.pdf\nWifi hardware switch is #18 on the diagram on page 7 :)\nTry turning it on and off.\n", "Q: ubuntu 12.04 starts up in 40 seconds, 11.10 it was 16 seconds Both on the same laptop; any tips?? Didn't I install it right or is it because I haven't been connected to the internet and so don't have the update packages? \nWireless is disabled by a hardware problem.\n\nA: Its still in beta and loads lots of debug stuff in background, would be correct to assess it when final version comes.\n", "Q: How to find a folder on my server with a certain name?

I tried to find it's location using:\nls -d */ | grep -E 'exampledocs'\n\nand \nfind * -regextype posix-extended \\-regex 'exampledocs' \\-type d\n\nand\ngrep \"exampledocs\" * --recursive\n\nNothing worked. How can I do this from the command line? I'm using Ubuntu Server 11.0.\n\nA: This also should work\nfind folder_full_path -name exampledocs -type d\n\n\nA: locate exampledocs | grep /exampledocs$\n\nA: find / -xdev 2>/dev/null -name \"exampledocs\" \n\nNote: This is from Debian, but it should work.\n\nA: With bash's globstar shell option and [[ evaluation, we can make use of recursive globbing and prefix removal to find directories that contain the needed string.

I install the mod like I would on a PC- delete META-INF and then move the class files to minecraft.jar. Once I install Modloader and the mod which I was trying to install, which was the Timber mod, I try to execute the file and it doesn't load.\n\nA: Perhaps you just did it with the minecraft launcher. This is also a jar file for linux. Are you sure you edited the file ~/.minecraft/bin/minecraft.jar and no other?\n\nA: Installing Minecraft mods in Linux is no different to doing it in Windows, and the steps you're describing appear to be correct.\nMinecraft is a bit fiddly with mods and it's easy to break it if you don't follow the instructions to the letter, do not install dependencies or, say, have a wrong version of the mod. \nRemove the broken minecraft.jar (or the whole bin folder) and repeat the steps.\n\nA: I'm assuming you used the launcher minecraft.jar instead of the correct one, I made the same mistake.\nYou need to do the steps you mentioned on the minecraft.jar file within ~/.minecraft/bin/. Then, when you are done, replace the minecraft launcher, the minecraft.jar file that you downloaded with a fresh copy.\n\nA: Since Minecraft has updated so much that the mod loader installers are basically automated\nJust download it and set it to install.\n\nA: Yes, it is the same, sorta. With Ubuntu, you can usually right click a mod.jar file and go to properties. Navigate to the permissions tab, and make sure \"Allow executing file as program\" is checked. Then run it with java runtime by right clicking and selecting \"Open with OpenJDK\" (These are the steps I used to install optifine, but the principle is the same with other jar files that allow executing to install)\n", "Q: USB Mouse on Laptop won't change window focus I have an Asus g74sx dual-booting Ubuntu and Win7 via Wubi. My touchpad and usb mouse work perfectly in Windows, but behave abnormally in Ubuntu; if I just use the touchpad, everything works fine, but if I try to use a USB Mouse, the mouse will function on the window that has focus, or on the desktop, but refuses to change focus unless I right click on the window's titlebar repeatedly until it snaps to. The odd thing is that this behavior also affects the touchpad; it has the exact same issue while the USB mouse is plugged in. Removing the USB mouse will return the touchpad to normal. I have tested this on Unity, Gnome-shell, Gnome Classic, and Enlightenment. \nI'm a Linux newbie, so this may be quite a ways off, but its almost as if Ubuntu is not interpreting my touchpad as a touchpad; rather, it thinks its a proper standard mouse. This is also confirmed by trying to install Synaptiks for multitouch support; the touchpad is indeed Synaptics powered but Ubuntu doesn't recognize it when trying to install that app from the Software Center. If it matters, the USB mouse is a Cyborg R.A.T. 7 wired mouse, and performs flawlessly in Windows. I can also confirm this issue occurs when using a Logitech MX Revolution wireless mouse.\n\nA: I solved my own issue using the information found here.\nhttp://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=1528982\n", "Q: Recommendation for socket software I'm learning how to deal with socket programming with socket(), bind(), connect(), listen(), etc. \nSo I'm looking for a socket software that is similar like this, that works in Ubuntu. The software in the link only works in Windows. \nAny recommendations?\n\nA: Not sure if something like that is around ...\nYou could test if a TCP socket is up by connecting to it with telnet [IP] [port] see the open ports on a server with netstat -an and scan a server for open ports with nmap.\n\nA: It sounds like the program you linked is just a gui program that does what nc does on the command line.\n", "Q: Migrating fonts from old to new server I have an \"old\" Ubuntu 11.10 server.\nI have a new (Amazon EC2) Ubuntu 11.10 server.\nI can only access them through the command line.\nHow can I migrate all the installed fonts from the old machine to the new machine? \nI assume it is just copying some subdirectories. Is it that easy?\nBackground: I am running tests on my software, on both machines and it is giving different results, because the available fonts are different. (And the tests are sensitive to changes in pixels.)\n\nA: I researched the answer to my own question:\nThere are three phases required.\n\n\n*\n\n*Find the font files.\n\n*Copy the missing files.\n\n*Update the font cache.\n\n\nFinding the Font Files\nLook inside /etc/fonts/fonts.conf. It contains a number of different directories, marked with <dir> and </dir> tags.\nIn practice, I found 4 directories listed, of which 3 were empty or non-existent. Note: One is probably ~/.fonts, which is on a per-user basis.\nCopying the Font Files\nCopy the font files from each directory into the corresponding directory on the target.\nI only bothered moving the files that were missing at the destination.\nUpdating the Font Cache\nOn the destination machine, run: \nsudo fc-cache -f -v\n\n(If fc-cache is not available, you need to install fontconfig, e.g. sudo apt-get install \nfontconfig)\n\nA: What do you mean by command line access ?\nDo you have ssh access ??? Then you could copy the directories via scp.\nscp -r UID1@hist1:/dironhost1 UID2@host2:/dironhost2\n", "Q: How to get  the eglibc source code used by Ubuntu? How do I get the source code for eglibc in a format that will allow stepping through the source with gdb?  \nI have tried using apt-get source libc6-dev and that works for getting the source code, but I think that since the pre-processor directives were not applied that the line numbers that gdb has does not match with the source I downloaded. This makes it less useful when trying to step through the source and look at how functions in libc are working.\n\nA: If you really want to step through the source I'd recommend building a libc without optimisation and without stripping the binaries.\nFortunately, that should be easy - since you've already got the source, you can build packages from it.  You'll want to ensure the DEB_BUILD_OPTIONS evnironment variable contains noopt to get -O0 binaries and nostrip to keep the debugging symbols, and then build as normal with debuild:\nsudo apt-get build-dep libc6\nDEB_BUILD_OPTIONS=\"noopt nostrip\" debuild -us -uc\n\nwill build you packages built with -O0 and without the debugging symbols stripped; you can then install them with dpkg and gdb will pick up the debugging symbols.  As an added bonus, gdb will also know where to find the source files, so you'll get source listings.\nSince we haven't changed the version of the packages, the next time you run an upgrade apt will replace these locally-installed packages with the archive versions.\n\nA: You can try apt-get source -d libc6-dev and this should give you the source and the diff in deb format. Then you can uncompress it and it should give the sources in tar.gz uncompress this as well.It should be stored in the directory that you ran the apt-get command in.\n", "Q: Supported Hardware List To start I should admit that I haven't done much work in Ubuntu in a few years.\nI am wondering is if there is still a single, canonical source of the hardware supported by the newest distribution of Ubuntu.\nIn specific, I want to get a 17-inch HP dv7t Quad edition laptop.\nBut more generally, it is just bothering me how little luck I'm having finding an up-to-date support listing.\n\nA: The link to Ubuntu Friendly in the accepted answer is broken because the Ubuntu Friendly website was decommissioned five years ago. The official Ubuntu certified hardware information is currently available at Certified hardware | Ubuntu.\n\nA: \nAs of April 23, 2018, the link in this answer is no longer functional. \n   It has been left in-place here for historical reasons.\n\nHave a look at Ubuntu Friendly, though it isn't complete. Nothing beats testing computers with a live USB before buying. My recent experience has been that major incompatibilities are rare these days, though you might have to do a bit of work on some machines.\n", "Q: Is it safe to remove files in .Sent/cur directory of dovecot? For unknown reasons the .Sent/cur folder of one of the users had grown up to 500 MB. Is it safe if I remove all the files of this directory? And why it had grown up so dramatically? Note, that this situation is happened just for one specific user, other users has in their .Sent/cur folder just some kilobytes of files. \nThank you!\n\nA: The folder you're talking about is part of a Maildir mail folder.  Each file under the cur subdirectory represents a message in the folder.\nRemoving the files should work, but you'd probably have a better idea of what you're deleting if you delete the messages via an IMAP email client.\nTaking Thunderbird as an example, you can click the button to the right of the list column headers and pick Size to show the size of each message in the folder.  This should make it pretty easy for the user to determine which messages are taking up most of the space.\n", "Q: Where can I download a live cd? The whole \"LiveCD\" concept is mentioned all over the place, and I've used live usb sticks before, but there appears to be nowhere to download this version. I thought that maybe this is wrapped into the standard version of ubuntu, but when I create a usb stick from the latest version (11.10) and try to boot from it, it loads up a text-based menu instead of the live cd that I've seen before. The menu gives an option to boot from the disk, but the boot freezes before ever making it to the gui.\nIs there something I'm missing? Is there a LiveCD iso hidden somewhere that I can download?\n\nA: No, USB sticks you're using are exactly the same as what everyone is referring to as \"LiveCD\". The only difference is that, to get the \"live\" environment you choose \"Try Ubuntu\" instead of \"Install Ubuntu\" when you boot from the CD or USB stick.\n\n", "Q: Using /var/log to backup some folders / database contents I need to backup regularly (daily, using cron) some folders along with MySQL database contents (in sql format). Is it okay to use /var/log (by creating a new folder to be used in it) for storing these backup files? In longer interval the contents of that folder will be backed up in external media.\nThanks in advance.\n\nA: There is no such thing as a Linux/Unix police force, arresting people for doing sysmtems management in an unwise manner. Sometimes that is a pitty, it would save a lot of work.\nSo the answer to your question is: Yes you can, but you shouldn't. Nobody will be looking for backup files in /var/log and therefore the backups are a waste of time/effort. \nCreate a directory like /var/mysql_backups and change the backup script to include this directory.\nDo a daily check if backups succeeded.\nDon't forget to do a recovery test once the backup has been running for a few days and repeat it every (half) year. \n\nA: It'd probably be better if you created your own directory within /var/ for these SQL backups to go to.  It will be easier for you in the long run to organize and view this data, and depending on the Cron jobs you'll be running - you wouldn't want it to interfere with any logs or backups for the actual system itself. \n\nA: Why don't you create a /var/backup folder or something like that?\nIn /var/log there should only be logfiles. \n", "Q: How to do GRUB editing? How to do grub editing in ubuntu version 11.04 and 11.10? What is the purpose of grub editing? If anyone knows the solution please answer it..\n\nA: Grub is the bootloader - so the purpose of editing it is to change parameters during boot.\nThe files you can edit are /etc/default/grub and the scripts in /etc/grub.d.\nChanging the grub.cfg in /boot/grub is not recommended as any changes you make manually will be overwritten the next time an update to grub is called.\nIf there is a specific reason that you want to edit the file please update your question.\nhttps://help.ubuntu.com/community/Grub2\n\nA: GRUB:= GRand Unified Boot-loader\nIt is a common boot loader that can boot the system, weather Linux or windows or others\nGrub Editing= play with the boot configuration or customize the boot configurations.\nHow to edit : as said in forestpiskie's post you can manually edit those files.. or use a GUI for that...\nGrub customizer is a good one ( look :Grub Customizer installation)\nStartup manager is also fine (check : community website )\nBUT IF YOU MANAGE TO MESS UP WITH BOOT, You can't boot into the system... don't worry a lot of methods are there to fix the boot loader.....\nThe recommended one is Boot Repair....Boot repair installation it can fix the problem even if the boot loader is deleted or corrupted......

Tried looking at other answers and working through the suggestions, but I still get the same error.\nI have a ReadyNAS drive with CIFS enabled and shares set up. I can access the shares from Windows and from Ubuntu Desktop 8. There are no username/passwords needed to access the shares.\nHowever, I am now setting up an Ubuntu server using 11.10 and when I try to mount the share using the following:\n$ sudo mount -t cifs //nasdrive/media /mnt/ReadyNAS/media\n\nI get the following error:\nCIFS VFS: Send error in SessSetup = -13\nCIFS VFS: cifs_mount failed w/return code = -13\nmount error(13): Permission denied\n\nI've tried adding \"-o uid=1000,gid=1000,username=guest,password=\" as well, with the same results. I am a bit of a newbie with command line Linux, so please be gentle with the jargon.\nThanks in advance for any help you can give!\n\nA: A post at the readynas.com forums led me to the answer to my own question (eventually!). Basically, ReadyNAS creates a user, starting at UID=1000 and with nogroup, for each share that you create. It never really tells you its doing this, but it does.\nYou can see/edit these using their FrontView web application, under Security > Account.  For me, I simply used the following entry in FSTAB\n//ReadyNAS/media /mnt/ReadyNAS/media -o user=media,password=,uid=1000,nogroup,ro,noserverino,iocharset=utf8 0 0\n\nNote that the ReadyNAS CIFS implementation does not support server-side inode numbers, so to avoid a bunch of warning messages, be sure to include the noserverino option. \nAlso, this is a read-only mount to access a media library, so I didn't use password protection. If I was using a password, I would substitute a credentials file and use the credentials= option instead of user/password.\nHope this helps!\n", "Q: What are the standard file permissions for the /etc directory(file) I kinda screwed up the /etc directory by running:\nsudo chmod 417 /etc \n\nLeaving me unable to use sudo:\nsudo: can't open /etc/sudoers: permission denied.\nsudo: no valid sudoers sources foundm quitting\n\nIve been trying to fix it via recovery mode but i'm not sure to what mode I should set it.\n(I know sudoers is 0440, but this doesnt fix it because /etc is still messed up.)\nOh and for the future,   how do i add lines to files in etc without screwing up the permissions of etc?\nThanks in advance,\nJoeri.\nP.S.

I am currently using Ubuntu 10.10 Maverick. I have tried installing  latest versions of Ubuntu but none of them work properly. All of them have problem with my graphics. \nNow, Ubuntu 10.10 Maverick is no longer supported. Is there a way it can be used safely for longer?  \n\nA: I felt the same way until I installed the gnome desktop, then things started working properly for me using 11.10. So, give 11.10 a try, but once installed open the Ubuntu Software Center and install GNOME Desktop Environment. All the funky effects will be gone and the user interface is like the 10.10\n\nA: You're not getting security updates anymore for 10.10, so I would say it's not safe any longer, but you can wait for the release of 12.04 and upgrade to that version. 10.10 reached the end of it's lifetime and no one else will be carrying the burden of supporting it.\nIf there is an option to install an additional graphics card, I would recommend you buy a (new) graphics card. It doesn't have to be top notch or even the newest generation, a low end to midrange model from the last 3 generations with passive cooling will suffice. You will get a nice Unity 3D desktop and with proprietary drivers probably even video acceleration.\nIf Unity is nothing for you 12.04 will provide the package gnome-fallback-session.\n", "Q: Enlarging the right half of gnome-shell panel?

As the title above suggests I want to add some custom wallpapers (png images I have created myself) to the user/share/backgrounds folder in 12.04. I have completed this task.\nIssue : They do NOT appear in the Desktop Appearance for selection ( I am assuming if they did appear here they would be the default background in the LightDM dynamic unity greeter.  Only the \"contest images\" work with unity greeter.  I came across the links below which are similar but to not resolve my question\nHow do I add new wallpapers?

The reason for suggesting is that I copied a theme folder using sudo nautilus. The theme did not appear in \"Advanced Settings\" for selection.  To make this theme work in Unity I copied it to ~.themes.  I copied the bankgrounds using the same method\n\nA: You have to edit the files in /usr/share/gnome-background-properties in order for them to appear in the 'wallpaper' section rather than the 'picture' section.\n\nA: I am using 12.04 Gnome Classic desktop. None of the solutions above have helped me to display my wallpapers in /user/share/backgrounds. If I click on + as suggested above, Ubuntu 12.04 opens my Pictures folder and does not add the wallpapers I added to /usr/share/backgrounds. The only way that I have found to do this is to add them to the precise-backgrounds.xml file as new items between the main <wallpaper> </wallpaper> tags. This is really a nuisance if you have a large number to add. I am hoping that someone has a simpler solution.\nThe only way that I have found to add my wallpaper to my login name in the greeter is to install Ubuntu Tweak and then set it using its options.\n\nA: I had similar issues, I don't know if there is another solution but here is mine.\nCopy and paste your wallpaper into usr/share/backgrounds. (Use gksu nautilus)\nRight click on your image file and select properties\nIn the permissions tab make sure \"Other\" is set to Read or Read Only\nRight click on your Wallpaper and set it as your desktop background\nLog out and it should appear as Your LightDM paper\nI dont know anything about Wallpaper Switcher however if this application can retrive the files from the usr/share/background location, Im sure it will work\n\nA: I'd written a little perl script to make it easier to add choices to the Change Desktop Background in Ubuntu.\nTo recreate it you could, for example, use sudo gedit /usr/local/bin/wallpaper-add-to-choices from terminal, paste the contents of the script, save, then sudo chmod 755 /usr/local/bin/wallpaper-add-to-choices.\nI found post this because I was searching for info about what might have changed in Ubuntu 12.04LTS.  The \"options\" portion of that script output used to say \"scale\", I had to change it to \"zoom\" or none of the images would work as choices.  It's a shame, I don't feel like manually resizing the dozens of images imported to a new system to scale them properly.  (Scale letterboxed the images, only enlarging the image until any edge hit the edge of the display, zoom means I lose the tops or sides of most images.)\n\nA: There is also another option that will make wallpapers from user's home directory available in lightdm.\nYou can choose one of two variants:\nVariant A.\nYou just have to run one simple command in terminal:\n$ sudo usermod -aG username lightdm\n\nJust replace username with your username. This will grant lightdm access to your home directory, so it will be able to display images from /home/username.\nVariant B.\nCreate new usergroup named, for example, wallpapers:\n$ sudo groupadd wallpapers\n\nThen, create a directory in your home directory, where you will store all wallpapers you want to use and change it's group to wallpapers:\n$ mkdir '~/My Wallpapers'\n$ chgrp wallpapers '~/My Wallpapers'\n\nAnd finally add group wallpapers as supplementary group for you and lightdm user:\n$ sudo usermod -aG wallpapers username\n$ sudo usermod -aG wallpapers lightdm\n\nRemember to replace username with your username.\nNotice that if you have more than one user using the system and you want to give ability like this for every one of them, you will have to repeat these steps (omitting adding new group - wallpapers) for each individual.\n\nA: After you added you images to /usr/share/backgrounds you need to open the Change Desktop Background dialog by right clicking in your desktop and selecting it.\nAfter the dialog is open you can click the + to add the backgrounds you just copied to /usr/share/backgrounds\n\nAdd all the images you have in /usr/share/backgrounds, after you have done that you can select one and it will become your background.\nIf you are using 12.04 that same image will become the dynamic background for the Unity Greeter. If it does not follow the Setting the dynamic switching off section of How do I change the wallpaper in LightDM? except instead of actually switching it off you use the command\ngsettings reset com.canonical.unity-greeter draw-user-backgrounds\n\nhas described in the answer.\nNote to summarise:\n\n\n*\n\n*Step 1: Add you custom wallpaper to `/usr/share/backgrounds\n\n*Step 2: Is conditional if you want your custom wallpaper to appear in\nthe dynamic unity greeter (log in) in 12.04.

GVim for vim outside the console, and how to install it\nYou asked whether vim can only be run from the console. GVim (GUI-Vim) is the standalone version. From your screenshot, it looks like you're using Ubuntu, you can find gvim in the Software Centre and install it from there.  Alternatively you can sudo apt-get install gvim from a terminal.\n2. Creating a .vimrc config file\nIt looks like, by default, vim/gvim doesn't create a .vimrc for you, so you can create one yourself.  Open vim, and type :e ~/.vimrc to edit a new file called .vimrc in your home folder (~)\nWe'll start by adding just one setting, so that we can see whether it worked.  Add the following text:\n\" switch on line numbering\nset number\n\nThe \" is the comment character.\nThen, quit vim and restart it - you should find that a line number 1 has appeared at the top left, and you should find that any file you edit from now on has line numbering switched on by default.\n3. Installing a plugin\nPlugins live in a folder called ~/.vim/, but, again, vim doesn't create this by default, so you have to make it:\nmkdir ~/.vim\n\nOver time, the .vim folder will grow several subfolders like:\n\n\n*\n\n*plugin for plugins\n\n*color for color schemes\n\n*doc for documentation\n\n*syntax for syntax highlighting modes\n\n\nBut for now it's empty.  Let's add one plugin, to try it out.\nStart by opening vim with vim . - that tells vim to open a folder in \"explorer\" mode.  We'll install NERDtree which is a popular file browser plugin, which will replace the default explorer.\nGo to http://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=1658 and dowload the zip file from the table at the bottom of the page.\nOpen it up in archive manager, choose \"extract\", and then tell it to extract into you ~/.vim/ folder.  You may need to hit Ctrl+H inside archive manager's folder browser, to show hidden folders.\nOnce it's extracted, it will create several subfolders in .vim for you.  If you now restart vim with a \nvim .\n\nYou should see the explorer view has changed!  It's now using the NERDtree plugin.\n4. More .vimrc settings\nMy full .vimrc is available here https://bitbucket.org/hjwp/vim/src, but here are a few settings I find really useful:\n\" syntax highlighting\nsyntax on\n\n\" map cut & paste to what they bloody should be\nvnoremap <C-c> \"+y\nvnoremap <C-x> \"+x\nmap <C-v> \"+gP\n\n\" sane text files\nset fileformat=unix\nset encoding=utf-8\n\n\" sane editing\nset tabstop=4\nset shiftwidth=4\nset softtabstop=4\n\n\" convert all typed tabs to spaces\nset expandtab\n\n\"autocompletion with ctrl+space\ninoremap <c-space> <c-n>\ninoremap <Nul> <c-n>\n\n5. Ctags\nI wouldn't worry too much about plugins at first, just getting to know the power that vim offers you out of the box should be useful enough to your coding already. But one thing that really is useful to have working in vim is ctags.  ctags lets you do things like \"jump-to-definition\", and autocomplete across all the keywords in your source tree.  start with:\napt-get install exuberant-ctags\nThen, in your .vimrc, add\nmap <f12> :!ctags -R .<cr>\n\nNow, when you hit \"F12\" in a vim session, it will generate a .tags file, which vim can use to scan for keywords.\nNow, if you're on, eg a function call in your source code, you can use ctrl+] to jump to its definition.  More info here: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/563616/vim-and-ctags-tips-and-tricks\n6. what's next\nOther people have posted some really useful-looking guides, here's a couple of SO pages I've found useful tho:\n\n\n*\n\n*https://stackoverflow.com/questions/95072/what-are-your-favorite-vim-tricks\n\n*https://stackoverflow.com/questions/726894/what-are-the-dark-corners-of-vim-your-mom-never-told-you-about\n\n*https://stackoverflow.com/questions/164847/what-is-in-your-vimrc\nIt's a whole vim-world out there.

The main reason is that I get the \"not supported\" message, and cannot upgrade to newer distributions through update manager, because I could never solve some errors, so I want to do a fresh install\nPlease help me with some questions:\n1) How should I do to reinstall 12.04 over my 10.10 without erasing /dev/sda3 contents, which stores all the backup info? (see image)\n2) Are the partition sizes shown ok or should I increase/decrease any? \n3) Is ok to format only /usr /var /tmp and /home? Should i format another to do a clean install?\n4) What will happen with grub and other things when I install 12.04 over actual 10.10? Should I remove grub before launching installation?\nThanks a lot in advance,\n\nA: When you run the installer, choose the advanced partition option. You'll have to re-specify all your mount paths (/dev/sda1 as /, /dev/sda8 as /home, etc.). Select to format sda1. Also, reformat /usr, /var, and /tmp (or get rid of them altogether). Do not reformat /home, or you'll lose all your data!\nI would use only two partitions: / and /home. More than that is overkill in my opinion unless you have very specific needs and are running a server. I recommend resizing things such that the space taken by /usr, /var, and /tmp is part of the / partition. Having many partitions really takes away from your ability to use your disk flexibly.\n", "Q: Save *.deb files from var/cache/apt/archives folder for future installation How can I store away the *.deb files from var/cache/apt/archives directory for future installation in case I need to reinstall the OS in ubuntu 11.10. I tried copying and saving  away but after OS reinstallation I tried reinstalling those deb files using \"apt-get install file\" but so many files were missed thought I copied everything. What am I missing, Please reply\n\nA: Apt manager always install a software by reading source file which contains list of packages,there dependency. These list file are updated when you run the update program (basically whenever you run the command sudo apt-get update)\nAfter a Ubuntu re installation those source files aren't updated.So you can update them using sudo apt-get update (Add PPAs if 3rd party software were used) and try with apt-get install method but wait, you may see that many files are being re downloaded (not all).\nIt is because those packages are updated with your previous installation of the software and now. Anyway in this case you have to download only the updated files. If the file hasn't updated it will take from your backup.You can see the required download size while installing.\nPreferable Method\nYou can use apton-cd to create backup of apt-files (I don't know whether it will work in current situation, surely you can use it for future), mount the iso after re installation. Add the media as a source and install software.Lot of tutorial available in web.\nManual Method\nAnother thing you can do is to install using dpkg. Go to the folder of apt backup, run dpkg -i name_of_deb.deb. But in this way dependency won't be installed automatically. You have to install each dependent package individually. Other wise installation will fail. For example: to install vlc you have to install the libraries first and finding out the dependent library is not an easy task. \nNote: I have told what I understand about installation in Ubuntu. Don't know whether any other method exists.\n", "Q: 'Invalid or corrupt kernel image' error while booting from USB stick I got the Ubuntu 11.10 32-bit edition and i used Unetbootin to write the ISO to a usb stick.After that i tried to boot from the stick,having changed the BIOS boot settings,and when the first interface shows up with the choices of istallation,whatever choice i select i got the message\"invalid or corrupt kernel image\".I use a netbook with windows 7 on it.I tried different usb sticks but same again.I also tried Universal USB installer instead of Unetbootin but same again.Any idea of what happens?I am using ASUS 1000H.The USB doesn't work in one more PC i tried to,but i also tried a second USB to both of the two computers and same again. I downloaded the ISO image once again and follow the same procedure but same again                                                                   \n\nA: You can verify downloaded Ubuntu images using md5sum. Here's a simple example to get the hash for a DVD image:\n$ md5sum edubuntu-11.10-dvd-amd64.iso\nf323d7e7b9686eb9c5babd94961e5df1 edubuntu-11.10-dvd-amd64.iso\n\nNow you can compare that against the Ubuntu Hashes page. In this case they match up meaning what I downloaded matches the original copy (with 99.99something percent accuracy).\nIf you downloaded an ISO not on that list you can usually still find a hash but it depends on the ISO's source. If you grabbed it from the daily page, there is a MD5SUMS file in there but it obviously changes every day.\nIf you can't verify the image, download it again and check it right away. It might be worth using the Bittorrent download options as that has built-in checking.\nThe following doesn't apply to you (you've already swapped out USB sticks, strongly suggesting it's an image issue), but it might help people in the future.\nIf your image verifies correctly but still doesn't work, just try copying it to the USB stick again. In some cases you might find you have a stick that just refuses to work (I've had a couple of old, cheap disks not boot Ubuntu.

Give it a try. \n\nA: I had the exact same issue with Ubuntu 12.04 LTS and solved it by downloading the image from another mirror. Apparently I was downloading a corrupted file.\n\nA: Please try and recreate another bootable USB installer - see official article about installing ubuntu from USB as a guide.

Everyone has different reasons for using Ubuntu.  Many of the reasons people choose to use Ubuntu are ethical, many are just about doing what you want with your computer.  Because Ubuntu is open source, it allows more customization than a Windows or Mac computer.  That being said, it does sometimes make it more difficult for users not accustom to that freedom, or to the feel of an Ubuntu Linux system.  It would be possible for him to create an account for you on the computer where it looked and felt like Windows of Mac (hope I'm not getting him in over his head here), and that may make the experience more enjoyable for you.  \nGenerally it's preferred to have a single question per posting here at Ask Ubuntu, but as to the second part of your question.  Once you have your own account on the computer you should be able to set up your own Ubuntu One account with your own pictures.  If you'd prefer you could use Dropbox instead.

Drive1 contains windows, drive2 contains downloads, music, videos and so on, drive3 contains Ubuntu. \nI would like to have drive2 mounted automatically (assuming I have to edit fstab), the real question is if there is anyway I can store some (not all) of Ubuntu's \"standard home folders\" for example have downloads and videos there. Would this be possible? I\n\nA: I would just change the default download location for your specific browser... I can't really offer much more detail because I do not know what browser you are using.\n\nA: First, make sure your drive2 is auto-mounted, most installs manage to configure that automatically, but you can edit fstab as shown here How to auto-mount ntfs partitions \nOnce you have drive2 mounted, create folders on that hard drive/partition where you want to store your videos and downloads, and then create softlinks or symlinks to those folders in your home directory. Like this (type these commands when you are in your home directory)- \ncd ~\nmkdir /path/to/drive2/mount-point/Videos\nln -s /path/to/drive2/mount-point/Videos\nThis should work for almost all programs as if you had the Video folder in your home directory.\n\nA: Assuming the drive where your videos/downloads/documents are, is NTFS. Run this \nsudo apt-get install pysdm\n\npress the windows key in your keyboard. and Type in storage device manager. When prompted give your password. Select your drive2(sda1/2/3) whichever you have your media files on select assistant, mount file-system in read-only mode, ok. And then apply, on the lower left corner, hit refresh. Now reboot your system.\nTo change the default folder you must install Ubuntu-tweak like so.\nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:tualatrix/ppa\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get install ubuntu-tweak\n\nopen ubuntu-tweak via dash\nthen go to administrators > default Folder locations >\n\nselect which folder you want to change. like the folder Documents then, on the lower right screen, click edit.

Currently what happens:\nI press Calculator button on my keyboard, and calculator pops up. No problem there!\nNext, after my calculation, I click back to the window where I'm inputting the calculation, and when I press the calculator button again, a NEW window opens in the calculator program.\nWhat I want to happen:\nWhen I click the calculator button, it switches back to the calculator program if it's already open, else, open calculator program.  I don't want it to open a new window every time I try to change back to my recent calculation.\nIt's not a big deal, obviously, just a slight annoyance to me so far.  Is there a setting, or some terminal command I can run, or anything I can do to change it?\nThanks!\n\nA: The tiny script below will do what you want. You need to install wmctrl for it to work:\nsudo apt-get install wmctrl\n\nAfter you've installed wmctrl, paste the text below into a file and call it whatever you want. I called mine calc-activate.sh.\n#!/bin/bash\n#This script switches focus to gnome-calculator if it is running.\n#If it is not running, it will run gnome-calculator.\n\nif [ \"$(wmctrl -l | grep Calculator)\" != \"\" ]; then\n    wmctrl -a \"Calculator\"\nelse\n    gnome-calculator &\nfi\n\nAfter saving, the text file, make it executable either by right clicking and going to the permissions tab and checking off the Execute  boxes, or do it from the terminal with the chmod command).\nNow you can set your multimedia keys:\n\n\n*\n\n*For Ubuntu 11.10 and earlier, go to: System → Preferences → Keyboard Shortcuts\n\n*For 12.04 and later, hit the Super key, type \"shortcut\" then hit Enter.\n\n*Now find the \"Launch calculator\" shortcut, click on it and hit backspace to disable it.\n\n*Now you can add a new custom shortcut. Point the command to the full path of the script you just saved. Click on the new command and press the calculator button to assign it. Voila!\n\n\nPlease note: Since wmctrl looks for a program titled \"Calculator\" the above script snippet might not work with other languages. To fix, change Calculator so it matches the window title of gnome-calculator.\nDanish example:\nif [ \"$(wmctrl -l | grep Lommeregner)\" != \"\" ]; then\n    wmctrl -a \"Lommeregner\"\nelse\n    gnome-calculator &\nfi\n\n\nA: If you are using the \"Microsoft keyboard and mouse\" program, uninstall it and install intellitype and intellimouse from Microsoft.\nI use a microsoft 5000 keyboard and mouse and recently installed MS K&M.

I do have access to the terminal - but thats about it.\nThanks to any help.\n\nA: I don't have a direct solution but you could open another terminal, do 'sudo adduser' and login with that user after restarting.\n\nA: Go to the login screen , but then login using the Console (Ctrl+Alt+F1) and not the login screen, then open the file ~/.gconf/desktop/gnome/interface/%gconf.xml for example with nano:\nnano ~/.gconf/desktop/gnome/interface/%gconf.xml\n\nThen you should see the font settings somewhere. Just edit the numbers (you'll know which ones are for the size) and don't remove any \"<\" or \">\" or anything similar!\nYou can also just reset the settings by deleting the settings file:\nrm ~/.gconf/desktop/gnome/interface/%gconf.xml\n\nAfter editing or deleting the file, use Alt+F7 to get back to the login screen, log in normally and the font should be normal again.\n", "Q: Double launchers and mouse captured between screens in Twinview configuration Just upgraded to 12.04 and noticed an extremely annoying issue. \nWhile using twinview, there now appears to be a launcher on each screen. Moving the mouse between monitors and over the launcher \"captures\" the mouse for half a second or so, creating the perception of lag.\nAccording to some bug reports I've read it appears that a launcher on every screen is a new \"feature\".\nIs there any way I can get rid of the 2nd launcher? It's driving my crazy.\n\nA: It's under System Settings, Display, Sticky Edges. You have to set this to off.\n\nA: You also have to set 'Edge stop velocity\" (in CCSM) to something very low but greater than 1.  \nFor an idea of suitable values:\n\n\n*\n\n*At \"1\", neither launcher appears, at a high value the launcher in the middle absorbs some of the momentum from the mouse so although not sticky it does cause a momentary check to movement. \n\n*At \"3\", which I use, it is no longer a nuisance, I'd recommend a simlar choice of number.\n\n\nA: It's an option in the system settings. It's found under monitors or under apperance (I'm not sure because it only shows if you have two monitors)\n\nA: Answering your second question: You can't disable the second launcher, because Unity fails to detect your Twinview configuration. If it were detecting it you would have an option to choose where to show the launcher in your Display configuration.\nFor reference: I'm having the same issue and it seems to be a know problem.\n", "Q: Screen went black I'm new to Ubuntu..\nI'm not sure what just happened, but the screen just went black with the text: \nUbuntu 11.10 \"my computer name\" tty4\nand I was asked to log on.\nIt happened when I closed Chrome (Alt+F4). This is the second time it has happened, and I cant make it go away :) Even if I log on. Only thing that works is to press Ctrl+Alt+Delete, which makes my PC restart.\nAny idea what is causing this?\n\nA: Looks like you accidentally switched to the text console, that does no harm at all as long as you know how to return to your desktop. Did you accidentally hit Ctrl+Alt+F4? In that case you can return to your desktop hitting Ctrl+Alt+F7.\nThere are usually 6 text consoles (F1 - F6) but most users aren't even aware of them. They're extremely useful for troubleshooting, but otherwise barely used these years.

Specifically, on this page, grab the 32-bit or 64-bit version of the CUDA toolkit for Ubuntu 11.04 (that's the closest to your system that's available, and will probably work). If you're unsure if you have the 32-bit or 64-bit version of Ubuntu installed, run uname -m. If it says x86_64, you have the 64-bit version; otherwise you have the 32-bit version.

It boots fine without stalling when the HDD is out, yet when in, the USB drive is completely ignored.\nI am aware this may be an issue unique to my hardware (eMachines-E525) or software/BIOS; is there anything I can config in the USB installation to make the BIOS recognise it? \n\n\nA: If your BIOS is configured to boot from USB drives before the main hard disk but fails to do so, then this is a BIOS problem.\nI would suggest checking the manufacturer's support web site to see if there are any BIOS upgrades: if you are lucky, they might have addressed the problem in an update.\n\nA: Somewhere in your (USB) boot sequence you are referring to /dev/sda*n* whereas you should refer to the disks UUID to optionally boot from an external disk. This is probably caused by the way you installed the OS on the USB disk. Did you copy a disk image directly to the USB disk?

I was trying to upgrade this afternoon from 11.10 to 12.04. After most of the packages had been downloaded, I lost my Internet connection. When I re-connected to the Internet, still on Ubuntu 11.10, software update showed me a huge ammount of updates to perform (because it hald already altered the software sources and ppas to 12.04).\nWell, I performed all the updates. Now, I have an Ubuntu that is half-way between 12.04 and 11.10. It identifies itself as 12.04, but its mostly 11.10. When I try update-manager -d, I get the message \n\nNot all updates can be installed, run a partial upgrade to install as many updates as possible. \n\nThen, if I click \"partial update\" I get the following error: \"an upgrade prom precise to oneric is not suported with this tool\"\nWhat is happening?  Is there a way I can fix this?  Perhaps changing ALL the software sources to 12.04's?  \nI don't want to do a fresh install, cause I want to keep all my installed software and all my settings!  \n\nA: You mention that your apt sources were updated during the partial upgrade.  The first thing you should do is verify this by checking the /etc/apt/sources.list to make sure the deb and deb-src lines reference precise instead of oneiric.  If they do not, edit the file to correct this using the following command:\nsudo gedit /etc/apt/sources.list\n\nOnce the sources have been updated, one way to complete the upgrade would be to enter the following two commands through the terminal:\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get dist-upgrade\n\nThe error message you got from the update manager about needing a partial upgrade is that some of the updated packages want to pull in dependencies that are not currently installed, which is not particularly surprising when the new packages are from a new distribution version.\nOnce that completes, you should be on the new version.  To clean up packages that are no longer required by packages that you explicitly installed, run the following command:\nsudo apt-get autoremove\n\nCheck that the list of packages it offers to remove looks sane before continuing.\n\nA: When this happened to me because the update process had \"too many errors\" (whatever that means), I did the following.\n\n\n*\n\n*Boot the recovery mode of whatever kernel still works.\n\n*Your / partition will have been mounted as read-only because you booted in recovery mode. Run fsck Check all file systems from the recovery menu. Hopefully it will complete successfully at which point your install partition will be remounted as read/write.\n\n*Enable networking so that you will have access to the Internet when you try to fix your packages.\n\n*Attempt to Repair broken packages\nMaybe this will not be any more successful than your previous attempts to fix the packages. But I figured it might be worth a try. It seems to have worked for me.\n\nA: Solution was to reinstall from scratch. Nothing lost because ubuntu keeps your \"home\" folder\n", "Q: Bitcoin PPA installation problem Im trying to download Bitcoin for my Ubuntu Oneiric.\n sudo add-apt-repository ppa:bitcoin/bitcoin\n sudo apt-get update\n sudo apt-get install bitcoin/bitcoin\n\nEverything goes smooth until the install line. \n Reading package lists...

Thus you will not find it in Synaptic.\nLooking on SourceForge, there appears to be a rather large sources.zip available.  Thus in theory you can download, compile and install as per the wiki instructions.\nI note there is now a company that has taken the opensource version and up'd its version to v3 and requires a license key etc.\nIf you like a challenge - use the wiki instructions to compile and install.

All of my songs have their artwork showing in iTunes but some don't when I'm back in Ubuntu. I don't know how to set the artwork in Rhythmbox and setting the file's icon doesn't really do anything. If it's of any importance, the songs that don't have their album artwork show in Ubuntu also don't have it show in Windows Explorer's tile view. How do I fix this?\n\nA: From the Rhythmbox FAQ:\n\nFrom where is artwork fetched? \nRhythmbox uses last.fm to look up artwork.\n  If you have local image files, saved in the same directory as the audio file(s) with the filename \"cover\", \"album\", \"albumart\", \".folder\", \"folder\" or \"$artist - $album\" Rhythmbox will use them instead of looking up a cover on last.fm. It will also use images extracted from file tags.\n\nSo, the answer will depend on how your artwork is stored in iTunes. If it is embedded in the actual AAC/MP3 file, or exists on last.fm for Rhythymbox, it will show up automagically in Rhythmbox. If it isn't in one of those two places, Rhythmbox looks for specific filenames (listed in the FAQ answer above).\nIf your artwork is external (i.e., not embedded) you would want to include those files in your Dropbox folder, or use a third-party tool to embed the artwork.\nI'm not an iTunes user, but if I recall correctly, it stores artwork in obfuscated directories and with obfuscated filenames.  If this is still the case, copying the artwork won't matter because the file will be named something Rhythmbox won't be able to read.\nYou could try this plug-in I found (but have never used), that says it will download and embed the artwork for you:\nhttp://www.freewaregenius.com/2007/11/11/itunes-art-importer/\nGood luck!\n\nA: Rhythmbox uses roughly the following method to pick what art to display:\n\n\n*\n\n*Display art embedded in the music file.\n\n*Display an image whose base name (i.e. without the file extension) matches the music file's base name in the same folder.\n\n*An image in the same folder whose base name is cover, album, albumart, front, .folder or folder.\n\n*If your music is tagged with its MusicBrainz release ID and that release is linked to the corresponding Amazon product entry, then the Amazon product art will be displayed.\n\n*Last.fm's web service is queried using the artist and album name to retrieve artwork.\n\n\nRhythmbox will stop once it has discovered a match.\nSo assuming you have each album in its own folder in your music library, the easiest and most reliable way to make artwork display in Rhtyhmbox for songs without embedded artwork is to place a file called folder.jpg or cover.jpg in the folder along with the songs in the album.\n", "Q: Triple boot Windows Vista, Ubuntu 11.10, Kubuntu 11.10 I've installed Ubuntu 11.10 from Windows Vista using Wubi, on my secondary hard drive.\nI want to install Kubuntu 11.10 in addition to Windows and Ubuntu on this secondary hard drive. It has 1 partition in NTFS . I've already prepared a live USB key with Kubuntu on it. What should I do now?\n\nA: By default wubi will remove the existing install prior to installing the second.\nThe best you can do is to install Kubuntu inside your Ubuntu and then choose at login which to use. \nIf you find there is not enough room it is possible to increase the size of the wubi disk - https://wiki.ubuntu.com/WubiGuide#How_do_I_resize_the_virtual_disks.3F\nSearch for kubuntu-desktop in Software Centre or if you wish to do so from a terminal the command is\nsudo apt-get install kubuntu-desktop\n\nYou will end up with multiple entries in your menus.\nIf you wish to then remove kubuntu you can find details here - make sure to use correct version\nhttp://www.psychocats.net/ubuntu/puregnome\nWubi Guide - https://wiki.ubuntu.com/WubiGuide\n\nA: \nIt has 1 partition in NTFS \n\nStart with splitting this into 2 partitions: 1 with Windows, 1 empty formatted to ext4 or ext3 instead of NTFS. You can use partition magic for this if you need the windows version (though it is not free ;) ) or use the Live USB you created. More info on superuser.com. On sevenforums there is a big Windows 7 + Gparted guide with lots of images that can help you (that will work for Vista too).\nAfter that you can install either kUbuntu (KDE) or Ubuntu (Gnome/Unity) on this new partition. \nYou will end up with actually 2 operating systems installed (and not a wubi install) and you will get a prompt at boottime to choose what system to start. You can still use Ubuntu from within Windows with the WUBI install.\n", "Q: MySQL error after rebooting (LAMPP) I don't know if this is the right place to put this question.\nI installed Lampp and followed this instructions http://www.apachefriends.org/en/xampp-linux.html#377 \nand everything worked fine until i rebooted the computer and this happened\n\nIt can be because of i rebooted the computer while lampp was on.\nAnyone that can help?\nEDIT:\nI can run php files.

My Apache got hosed from CD upgrade Question pretty much sums it up. I was running Ubuntu 11.10 and had Apache serving a few virtual hosts. I popped in the Ubuntu 12.04 CD (Beta 2) and rebooted. I choose to 'Upgrade Ubuntu 11.10'.\nThe result is that my home folder is still intact and most settings seem to be there, but I couldn't access any of my sites. I eventually realised that apache no longer exists on the system! \nAnyway, if I had done this at work (and I could have), I would have made quite a mess for myself. I understand that it's not Ubuntus job to educate me and that as a techy I need to know these things. But I really thought it would be the same as upgrading from the Update Manager.\nCan anyone explain?\nMany Thanks,\nTen\n\nA: The livecd can not upgrade, only replace the existing install with a new one, so if you did that, you would no longer have any packages installed that aren't part of the base install.\n\nA: 12.04 is not final yet and since the release of Beta 2 over 3 weeks ago lots of packages got updated. I would not expect such a feature to work flawlessly in Beta state. Did you really upgrade from CD, not just reinstall?\nIn theory the installation media contains a repository of packages and the upgrade from installation media functionality works like the regular upgrade but prioritizes packages from the installation media. Obviously the CD only contains a very limited number of packages needed for the default install. The DVD contains a lot more packages, but not all. The upgrade should detect your selection of packages and replace them with newer ones. Packages not found locally should be downloaded if there is an Internet connection available. The upgrade should warn about PPAs, software that is going to be removed and replacement/alteration of configuration files if I recall correctly. In case of no Internet connection, the package should be removed/uninstalled but the configuration files shouldn't be altered.\nThat said upgrading from installation media and without installation media should be the same. As long as there are packages for your installed applications in the repository of the new release you're upgrading to nothing should be uninstalled. If you don't have an Internet connection at the time of upgrade and no local repository with the package for the new release, then of course no package can be found and the application will be uninstalled.\n", "Q: How I turn off backlight around switcher icons In the Launcher it is possible to switch off the backlight of the icons.\nHow can I reach the same effect for the switcher icons?

What am I doing wrong?\n\nA: Try this:\ngnome-terminal --tab -t \"watch\" -e \"watch ps -ef\" --tab -t \"top\" -e \"top\"\n\nIt seems that gnome-terminal ignores --tab if there is only one in the command line. You have to provide at least two --tab to have some effect.\nThe command to execute is given by -e or --command. I used watch and top in my example because they run indefinitely so the tabs will stay open. Once the command is done executing the tabs will close themselves.

What are the criteria for a user background to become login background on user selection?\nI'm using 12.04 (beta) having jumped from 10.04, so I don't know whether it's the same with 11.10.\nBasically there are 2 users set up on my machine. I've assigned custom background pics for both users. On the login screen when you select one user for login, the whole background changes to the background for that user.

Or more to the point, set by accident then forgotten?!\n\nA: The image file for the wallpaper must have its permissions set to be world readable. Note however, that only the image file is used on the login screen. It does not use the background colors, gradients, transparency, or scaling mode settings which the user has chosen. Also, I don't think animated or automatically updated wallpapers (such as the \"Slideshow\" wallpaper selection) work for this.\nTo make the wallpaper world readable If you go to the file in the file manager, and open its properties, there is a permissions tab. The setting for \"Others\" in there must be set to at least \"Read\", and not \"None.\" \n\nThe default set of wallpapers in Ubuntu, which is installed in /usr/share/backgrounds are all of course readable by everyone; as are the wallpapers in the gnome-backgrounds package. Custom images in the user's home directory shouldn't be, in general.\n\nA: kelvin.illa is right:\n\nParent directories above the image file should also be readable by others\n\nI had to make up to my home directory readable by others so that the login background would change.\nchmod -R 755 /home/your_home_directory\nThis will give read and execute permissions to the group and others.\n", "Q: Equivalent to Windows Group Policies (GPO) in Ubuntu I am trying to apply GPO for client Ubuntu machines in a centralized way.\nIs it possible to apply GPO in ubuntu 10.04 ( other than using likewise Enterprise)?

I want to modprobe a module from the kernel command line (in my case yaboot, but you are probably more familiar with grub).  This is for a workaround for the live CD.  I've seen some old advice that says this is possible in Ubuntu.  However, it doesn't seem to work for me.\nThe module I want to load is a framebuffer (so it is normally blacklisted).  I don't know if that complicates things, but I can't seem to modprobe any module from the kernel command line. Is there any other Command Line that would do it?\nDoes anybody know if this is possible, and how you would do it? Thanks.\n\nA: To load a module when the kernel is called from the bootloader you have only to add the name of the module. \nThe syntax is the name of the module, if you want to pass an option to the module, type modulename.moduleoption.\nFor example, in my old computer I have an ISA Plug & Play Ethernet Adapter RTL8019/11901 that works with the NE module. On the kernel command line I add ne.irq=0x0220 and boot. Finally the card is recognized.\n\nA: Grub uses the insmod command to load up modules.

(Multiple Ideas) Got myself in a little over my head in partitions. Currently I have an ubuntu 11.10 distro and a backtrack distro on my hard drive. I can't run Diablo 3 on a virtual box successfully, so I made a backtrack virtualbox. I've still got the windows installation CD's that came with the computer, so my question is how should I go around switching my partition from backtrack/ubuntu to windows/ubuntu?\nHeres what my gparted window looks like:\n/dev/sda1 is file system ext4 and is my ubuntu partition\n/dev/sda2 is file system extended and is my backtrack partition,\nit has alot of partitions under it...\nsdas 5 6 and 7, where 5 and 7 are linux-swap, 6 is ext4\nIm worried that If I try and delete my backtrack partition I'm going to run into problems booting my drive. Am I right in this fear?\n\nA: My personal solution: Burn a GParted live usb, delete your backtrack partition, and hope for the best. In theory, as long as Ubuntu is installed to sda1, the system will still work. But be sure to backup your data first. ALSO: A word of warning, windows installs completed after installing Ubuntu sometimes overwrite GRUB, manual intervention may required, but nothing too hard.\n", "Q: Can I install Ubuntu on a partition formatted as ntfs instead of ext4? Can I install Ubuntu on a partition formatted as NTFS, instead of EXT4?\nAfter installing Ubuntu 11.10 using ext4, I keep on getting disk errors at boot up.  But on this same harddrive, I have Windows 7, and I don't get these errors.  So I wanted to try NTFS, instead of EXT4, and see if it makes any difference.\nThe harddrive is about 5 years old.  So if it is failing, I would think it would be giving trouble in Windows just as well.\n\nA: Make a backup of all your valuable files Don't say I didn't warn you. If your disk is acting suspiciously ... better safe than sorry. As a matter of fact, you should backup your files on a regular basis anyway ...\nDon't use NTFS as your filesystem to install Linux on, NTFS support is ... suboptimal. This is caused by the fact that NTFS support is all about reverse engineering as there is no documentation publicly available.\nExt4 is proven technology, it should work just fine. What errors are you getting? Try badblocks -v /dev/sdan where /dev/sdan should be replaced with the device you see when you enter df -h / | cut -d' ' -f1 | grep dev or /dev/sda when you feel lucky.\n\nA: In short, no.  If there is something wrong with the disk, you need to address that instead.  Open the disk utility and check the SMART status of the drive, and run the long self test.\n", "Q: Gedit stating that its unable to retrieve file info even though it works While this isn't causing any serious issues (that I've seen so far), it is  aggravating me because its taking over the terminal window that I was working on with the warning:\n(gedit:3288): Gtk-WARNING **: Unable to retrieve the file info for `file:///home/amn/Programming/Java/MyLiero/Driver.java': Error stating file '/home/amn/Programming/Java/MyLiero/Driver.java': No such file or directory\n\nHowever, the file opens up fine and is editable/savable and everything still exists after the program is closed.

From the Dash, open a terminal and enter the command:\nsudo fdisk -l\n\nThis is to find out the partition to which you have installed Ubuntu. It'll be sdXY, where X is the drive: it'll be a letter such as a or b; and Y is the number that has been given to the partition on that drive: it'll be a number. Find your Ubuntu partition there, if you can. You need to know X and Y. (If you can't tell which is the right partition, you can open GParted from the Dash to get a graphical view of your partitions, and maybe figure it out from there.)\nOnce you know that, then enter the command:\nsudo mount /dev/sdXY /mnt\n\nwhere X and Y are the partition that you found in the previous step. For example, if your Ubuntu partition is sda1, you'll enter \"sudo mount /dev/sda1 /mnt\". This is to mount the partition so that you can work with files on it.\nNow you need to reinstall grub to that partition. If you're running Ubuntu 11.04 or later, enter this command:\nsudo grub-install --boot-directory=/mnt/boot /dev/sdX\n\nwhere X is the partition (a, b, c, etc.) that you obtained above: note that it does not take a number this time.\nIf your version of Ubuntu is older than 11.04, then enter this command instead:\nsudo grub-install --root-directory=/mnt /dev/sdX\n\nThis will reinstall the Ubuntu grub you had been using before. When you reboot, you'll have your old grub.

Where are they located?\n\nA: Transmission stores your torrent files in your standard config folder, at ~/.config/transmission/torrents where ~ is your home folder.\nThe .config folder is usually hidden. To get there, open the File Browser and go to your home folder. Choose View > Show Hidden Files in the menu, then look for \".config\". In that folder you'll find transmission, and the rest should be pretty straight-forward.\n(By the way, to find a file in a long list you can just start typing its name).\nThe torrent folder contains every current torrent, and it includes torrents downloaded from magnet links as well. You can just open those with another client and it will work right away.\nRemember to turn Show Hidden Files back off later on, or you'll see a lot of strange looking files:\n\n\nA: In complement for the daemonized transmission, you can check theses files :\n/etc/init.d/transmission-daemon for changing user executing transmission,\n/etc/default/transmission-daemon for finding CONFIG_DIR=\"/var/lib/transmission-daemon/info\"\nThe \"config_dir\" info is a symbolic link to /var/lib/transmission-daemon/.config/transmission-daemon and here we can found another link settings.json to /etc/transmission-daemon/settings.json\nNow you can fully customize your transmission's directory structure\n\nA: Check here too:\nIf you're daemonizing transmission on Ubuntu (using the package transmission-daemon) and using a gui then:\nThis data is stored in /var/lib/transmission-daemon/info (requires root access to view, use sudo from the command line or install nautilus-gksu).

I'm running Xubuntu 11.10 and I've got this here GTK theme which is pretty nice, and I like the title bars and everything, but I've got a problem.\nEvery menu in the entire system has this weird and annoying translucent effect.  I don't want this effect.\nI've pored through the gtkrc for the theme for hours now and turned up nothing, I've googled and googled, I've tried editing the pixmaps to remove the transparency but nothing I do makes any difference.\nEach time I make any change, I reload the theme by changing it in xfce-appearance-settings and then changing it back.

Is it still true that I need to reinstall Ubuntu not using wubi? \n\nA: You did a wubi install where ubuntu is entirely contained within a file in your Windows install.  It sounds like you only allocated about 15G to that file.\nIf your intention was to replace Windows with Ubuntu and give it the whole drive, then you will need to reinstall Ubuntu properly by booting from the disc, not running it within Windows.\n", "Q: NVIDIA QUADRO 4000 graphics card not working I have a new home build with the following hardware:\nMemory: (16GB - 2 of Corsair Vengeance 8 GB ( 2 x 4 GB ) DDR3 1866 MHz (PC3 15000) 240-Pin DDR3 SDRAM)\nMobo:  (ASUS LGA 1155 - Z68 - PCIe 3.0 and UEFI BIOS Intel Z68 ATX DDR3 2200 LGA 1155 Motherboards P8Z68-V PRO/GEN3)\nCPU:  (Intel Core i7-2700K 3.5 GHz LGA 1155 Processor BX80623I72700K)\nGraphics card:  (NVIDIA Quadro 4000 by PNY 2GB GDDR5 PCI Express Gen 2 x16 DVI-I DL, Dual DisplayPort and Stereo OpenGL, DirectX, CUDA, and OpenCL Profesional Graphics)\nHDD: (Seagate 1TB SATA)\nDVD drive:  (Lite-On LightScribe 24X SATA DVD+/-RW Dual Layer Drive IHAS424-98)\nI tried to install Ubuntu 11.10 by downloading the iso file and burning a DVD.

(No Windows folder (ntfs) in network, file system is exe4 across all machines, no virtual machines (VBOx) running)  \n\nA: In Nautilus, after you've set up the folder you want, and when you have it open, choose \"Bookmarks\" from the top menu (global menu if you're using Unity), choose \"Add Bookmark.\"  After that it should be permanent and remain in your list after you reboot.\n", "Q: Where can I get wimax-tools? linuxwimax.org has been down for ages, is there anyway I can get the wimax daemon and wimax-tools so I can use my intel 6250?\n\nA: You can find the wimax tools at the following location:\n\n\n*\n\n*https://github.com/ago/wimax-tools\n", "Q: Pixel Shader to OpenGL converter I am running ubuntu 11.10 on my computer and I would like to emulate a wii. I have a wii emulator running successfully on ubuntu, but it requires pixel shader. I am most sure that my graphics card has OpenGL, but am also sure that it doesn't have pixel shader. It would be very helpful if there was a driver that tricked the emulator that i have pixel shader, when I am infact using OpenGL for the animation.\n\nA: Yep, OpenGL http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenGL is a software API which may use hardware capabilities of the card or software emulation to render 3D scenes. \nPixel shaders http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pixel_shader are one of the card's hardware features and supported by OpenGL 2.0 and above. \nMesa3D http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mesa_3D is an open-source implementation of OpenGL API which has software mode and fully supports OpenGL up to 3.0, so I suppose it should be able to render shaders in one form or another.\nThe catch, however, is that it's going to be painfully slow - there's a reason why they call video cards \"3D accelerators\"  \n", "Q: set window properties (above, on all workspaces) in js/gnome-shell-extension? As part of teaching myself how to make gnome-shell-extensions, I'd like to be able to tell a window to be on all workspaces on on top of all other windows.\nI notice in the mutter API there is a meta_window_set_above in window.c but this doesn't seem to be exposed to the JS interface. Through a bit of trial and error I also seem to be able to call window.set_property('above',true) but this function appears to do nothing (there is a 'title' property I tested on and using set_property on this seems to do nothing).\nSo, does anyone know of an alternate way to set a window's properties in a gnome shell extension? (and how to tell whether a function in the API gets exposed through javascript? I (naively) thought it'd be as easy as \"oh, there's a meta_window_set_above in window.c, so I must be able to call window.set_above(true), but I guess not.\n\nA: I asked this question of the gnome mailing list - turns out that the meta window properties are all read-only, so I can't (currently) set the above/on all workspaces options using mutter.\nHowever, I can use a library wnck to achieve this. Whilst mutter is still preferred, this may be the only way for now.\nLuckily wnck has gobject introspection, so this was sufficient:\nconst Wnck = imports.gi.Wnck;\nlet window = Wnck.Screen.get_default().get_active_window();\nif ( window ) {\n    window.make_above();\n}\n\nThere are functions make_above, unmake_above, pin, unpin, stick, and unstick (although I don't know what the difference is between pin and stick), all listed here.\n", "Q: Keyboard map is incorrect when using an NX-client I have a problem with nomachine NX-client in Ubuntu.

I would appreciate if somebody could help me out. \nBTW, the NX-client on windows connects to the same server with no keymapping problem so I believe this is a problem in Ubuntu and has nothing to do with the server side.\n\nA: I had the same problem under Gentoo.  I can't promise that this will work on a CentOS 5 server, but this worked for me on a Gentoo server.\nInside your nx session, open a terminal window and run:\nsetxkbmap -model evdev -layout us\n\nReplacing \"us\" with your desired layout if it isn't the US layout.  Your keymap should be correct now.  If you start your nx session using an .xsession/.xinitrc style script, you can add the setxkbmap command to the startup script.\n\nA: I solved the problem by going to Preferences → Keyboard Shortcuts and selecting Desktop → Take a screenshot.\n\nThe setting there showed (seemingly correct) Print.

I have about 20 computers with Ubuntu 10.04 on them, which will be used in a computer lab for elementary, middle, high school and college kids. Some seniors and new computer-users will be using the computers.\nI want to lock-down the computers for so children and people who want to play around with PC configuration can use them securely and without breaking them.\nI therefore want to restrict user privileges, removing the ability to upgrade, add/install software or otherwise personalize the lab's computers.\nThe only uses for these computers should be: \n\n\n*\n\n*access to school websites for access of e-text books (homework\nassignments) \n\n*access to learning-aid websites(such as www.math.com or\nwebster.com) \n\n*access/restrictions to applications that are safe and appropriate\nfor the elementary students. \n\n*For more senior users only, access to websites for\ncompleting applications for re-certifications of say food stamps,\nmedicaid and so on.\nAre there any software packages that will let me do this?\n\nA: I would start by investigating whether using Ubuntu standard Guest account would suit your needs regarding preventing users from installing stuff/modifying configs etc. So your machines would have a password-protected admin account to install/configure things and a password-less Guest account for your users.\nFor restricting Internet access I'd use Dans Guardian.\n\nA: It sounds like you want users to share a single account. You should investigate whether you really want this. There is a large number of reasons why this usually is a very bad idea. One is that you really cannot prevent users from spying on each other, obtaining personal information like passwords to webmail. You can try to prevent that by locking down network access, but then you're setting yourself up as a ghostbuster, forever fighting loopholes. \nThis kind of setup is common in Windows environments because the software to provide a proper multi-user environment is so expensive. But with Ubuntu, you get everything you need without any associated costs. If I were you, I'd really examine that choice. Trying to lock down a computer system is a very time consuming task, and very, very difficult. On the other hand, setting up a proper environment where users have their own accounts, and you're able to easily revert any bad decisions, is much easier and will give you a much better result in nearly all cases. \n\nA: For locking down overall operating system access I would run and configure bastille-linux on the host computer. This will walk you through a series of options and will harden the operating system based on your answers. If your not familiar with the tool you can accept the defaults and that should suffice. I would also recommend consulting the CIS Debian Benchmark document that outlines a number of procedures for locking down the operating system even further. \n\nA: I'd suggest that you check out the LTSP project.\nI recently heard a school Techrep discuss how he uses LTSP thin clients in his school district. By using thin clients no one but administrators actually have physical access to the expensive, maintained system. \nThe thin clients can be regularly refreshed since they don't store anything. The thin client hardware can likely be old computer chassis destined for the trash (but should have good displays, keyboards, and mice so they remain easy and satisfying to use). The software on the thin clients would normally be maintained from the server, saving travel if there are labs in different buildings.\nOf course the servers still have to have privileged and unprivileged accounts.\n", "Q: How do I run and Ubuntu desktop in EC2? we have implemented a cloud using the ubuntu server and amazon ,we installed the uec image given by amazon of ubuntu 9.04 ,we were successfull in accessing through the terminal by using it as ubuntu@ but failed to virtualize the environment like we get in the virtual box on client system. please suggest me a way\n\nA: I run 12.04 as a Free Cloud Desktop on AWS EC2 all constantly on the Free Tier Micro instance model.

Also which application should I use for TV in Linux?\n\nA: If the upstream Linux master your kernel was built from supports your TV tuner, the driver is already installed. If there is no support in your Linux kernel, but out-of-master support elsewhere, I'd advise you not to bother trying until it gets committed to master. There is a reason it is not in master yet.\nDigital TV\nIf you are in Europe, you need to use software supporting the DVB standard.\nDVB apps (in order of decreasing user friendliness):\n\n\n*\n\n*Kaffeine\n\n*Totem\n\n*Me-TV\n\n*Mythtv\n\n*Mplayer\n\n\nIf you are in North America, you need to use software supporting the ATSC standard.\n\nAnalogue TV\nUse tvtime or a similar program.\nIdentifying a PCI card or USB dongle\nA lot of products share the same chips for receiving i.e. DVB content.

If I disable security on my wireless network, it works fine. As soon as I enable any type of security, it stops working and Network Manager keeps asking for my network key/password over and over again.\nThe same dongle works fine on Windows with or without security and I've already updated to the latest driver (8192cu) from Realtek.com.tw and I've already blacklisted the default driver, rtl8192cu.\nNone of this has helped but, like I said, it is working, just not with security enabled. What can I try next?\n\nA: I had the same problem and here's how I solved it. The summary is the built-in driver didn't work work completely, and I downloaded installed the manufacturer's driver instead, making sure the new driver was set to start on boot while the built-in driver was blacklisted. \n\n\n*\n\n*Search on the Realtek site for your hardware.

You can immediately test the new driver by manually unloading the old driver and manually loading the new driver. After these steps, the networking should work.\nsudo modprobe -r rtl8192cu\nsudo modprobe 8192cu\n\n*Reboot and test the networking again to confirm that your changes 'stick'.\nI recommend keeping the \"zip\" file from Realtek around in case you need it again. The changes to files in /etc should survive upgrades, but the driver itself may not survive all kernel upgrades and the \"install\" step may need to be repeated. \n\nA: Wow worked like a charm for last 1 hour.

What I find is that despite having the same chip, some of them will work in Ubuntu 12.10 and 13.04 right out of the box without having to re-install the driver and some won't work with the native kernel drivers. One of the8188/8192cu minis without an antenna will connect if I move the laptop closer to the AP and the other won't and that tells me distance can be the real problem in some cases rather than the driver. I find it very interesting that different dongles with the same chip may or may not work with the native drivers.

Kernel drivers for the GMA3600 are still experimental and have not made it into the kernels that are in Ubuntu's repositories yet. Because your kernel doesn't have the drivers it falls back to using the default resolution, 800x600. \nYou've got two options: \n1) Wait for the GMA3600 drivers to make it into mainline, easy enough...\n2) Compile the kernel with the experimental drivers. This isn't as hard as it sounds, especially since someone has already done it. The kernel produced through that guide works fine with the x101ch, has wireless drivers and everything.

Your phone should be connected to a wireless network and the desktop from which you would like to access the phone filesystem should be in the same network.\n\nA: Have you considered online alternatives? Ubuntu One offers 5GB of free storage, and paired with the app for your phone you could easily transfer the pictures back and forth. \nAnother option would be to look in the Ubuntu Software Center, if my memory serves me right theres one or two applications for connecting to phones (though one is for CDMA [or non sim card] phones so I don't know if that will help.\n", "Q: Which files have SUID bit in bin/ folder Accidentally, I made a mistake with files in /bin/ folder, and now I learned that some of it need to have SUID bit.

I was thinking about creating a folder which I only can access. I want to know if I create the private folder, does it going to degrade the cpu performance as it may result in heavy encrypting and decrypting ?!\nIm on Ubuntu 11.10 32 Bit OS\nIntel Core2Duo\n4 GB RAM.\n\nA: Nope ! It does not give much pressure as I only have instructed the system to encrypt and decrypt the \"Private\" folder under /home/username/Private\nIf you use ecryptfs to encrypt the whole \"home\" directory then you will notice a lot of disk read/write noise coming at startup. Im using ecryptfs only to encrypt/decrypt the \"Private\" directory so it means less stress over the CPU.\n\nA: Ofcourse it puts a bit of extra pressure on your cpu. Decrypting and encrypting has to take place!\nThat being said, I do not believe that you'll notice any significant performance dump.\nIf you encrypted everything, even system files (I do not know if the tool lest you!) maybe you would notice lower performance!\nBut if fx. you encrypted your entire home folder i do not believe it would decrease overall performance.\nTest it - you could always revert your changes if the task's are to cop consuming ;)\n\nA: Using ecryptfs may cost some memory, but without measuring it I'm quite sure it's negligible in comparison to your 4GB. It shouldn't cost any CPU time, except when using the encrypted folder (and maybe when logging in, but I don't think it's measurable).\nYou can find out the encryption speed e.g. by using Truecrypt (or OpenSSL or whatever). On a 4-core CPU supporting AES-NI it's possible to encrypt 3 GB/s, which is far more than the disk can provide. Without knowing much about your CPU I'd guess it can encrypt about 150 MB/s, which might be a problem for a disk-intensive application if everything was encrypted. Encrypting one folder should be fine, anyway.\n", "Q: ~/.Xauthority required but missing I've now run into two instances where I've received errors because the ~/.Xauthority file is required but is missing from my user folder. I have read that the .Xauthority file has been deprecated, and the function has moved to:\n/var/run/gdm/auth-for-<USER>-<RANDOM_CHARACTERS>/database`\n\nI have attempted the solution provided in How do I create the .Xauthority file?. Which suggests I make a symbolic link from $XAUTHORITY to ~/.Xauthority upon startup. But this method has has not worked for me. I've also tried running that command and variations of it in the terminal, but without success. I am running, in vmware workstation 8, a minimal install of ubuntu server 11.10 64bit with xfce4 on top.\nThe error, \"Unable to copy the user's Xauthorization file\", I've received twice now. First when attempting to open a root terminal from the Thunar context menu, using the 'custom action' feature, with the commandgksu \"xfce4-terminal -default-working-directory=%f\". Then again, when attempting to install truecrypt, which gives me the error a few steps into the installation process.\nIs there another way to go about this? And, more fundamentally, why do applications still rely on this file if it has been deprecated? Since they do, why isn't a link provided by default until the software catches up? I understand things are not always so tidy, and also that I may be missing something important and basic, so please forgive my impudence.\n\nA: The location of the X cookie file is indicated by the XAUTHORITY environment variable.\n~/.Xauthority is the default location of the X cookie file, when the variable is not present in the environment. If an application looks for ~/.Xauthority when XAUTHORITY is present, it's buggy. ln -s \"$XAUTHORITY\" ~/.Xauthority should work, though¹. If it doesn't work, tell us what happens: copy-paste the error message; or if you get no error message, tell us the output of ls -l \"$XAUTHORITY\" ~/.Xauthority.\nNote that when you are running commands as root through sudo, the XAUTHORITY variable is removed from the environment. You should avoid running commands as root. For example, don't run gksu \"xfce4-terminal\" to run a terminal emulator as root. If you really want to run a shell as root, open an ordinary terminal, and run sudo -s inside it.\n¹  Unless your home directory is shared (typically over NFS) between several Linux machines.  \n\nA: I had the same error message when trying to launch GUI apps with gksu.\nI just figured out that you can log out, then select Ubuntu on Xorg session.

(Please update/edit your question if you any further info to add.)\n\n\n*\n\n*You say \"I installed grub manually onto the hard disk (/dev/sda).\"\nSo you have already booted into the 12.04 installed on partition sda5 and successfully run\nsudo grub-install /dev/sda?\n\n*You say that \"... after booting into Windows 7, grub doesn't load on\nthe next boot. The computer simply reboots again and again.\"\nDoes it make any difference which of the two entries for Windows in your GRUB menu you use to boot into Windows?\nThere is one for /dev/sda1 (label \"OSDisk\") and another for /dev/sda3 (label \"BDEDrive\").\n\n*Is there any error or status information at all displayed prior to or during this infinite boot loop? Can you tell if it is Linux/GRUB or Windows that is looping?\n\n\nI am wondering if there is some conflict between your two Windows boot configurations. Only one of them would seem to be needed. (Probably the one on the first partition, OSBoot?) \nPerhaps you might learn something by installing a Windows boot utility such as EasyBCD and making sure your Windows boot settings are correct? \n\nAnother alternative might be to bring up the Windows 7 Advanced startup options boot menu by pressing F8 immediately after starting a Windows boot from the GRUB menu. If the option to Repair your computer is available in the advanced options boot menu, you could run Startup repair to check for and (maybe) correct problems in your Windows boot setup.\nNote: You have to be quick pressing F8 or Windows will just boot as usual.\n\nI'm not sure exactly what is going wrong, but could there be some corruption in either your Windows or Linux file systems?\nThe excerpt below is from your boot-repair log from lines 616 to 641. The repeated failures of getcwd() (get current working directory) and the GRUB warning about ZISD (ZENworks Image Safe Data ?) might mean something.

These parts are unused by the Windows boot loader but GRUB needs them. Whenever you boot into Windows parts of  GRUB will then be overwritten.\nFrom my \"Ubuntu view\" here I can't really tell which program might be the culprit but you may find it in one of the following groups:\n\n  \n*\n  \n*Boot sector viruses (rare nowadays - but who knows)  \n  \n*Antivirus software (look e.g. for Boot-Sector \"protection\")  \n  \n*Other \"safety\"- or \"protection\"-suites  \n  \n*Automated backup solutions  \n  \n*Custom drivers/software from your PC manufacturer  \n  \n*Copyright-\"protection\" from software  \n  \n\nOf course this list is incomplete but it may help you to get an idea where to look.\nTo test if something overwrites your MBR you may want to compare your boot loader from when GRUB is loading and after you booted Windows. Just copy and safe the Master Boot Record to a file by this command (assuming you boot from /sda):\nsudo dd if=/dev/sda of=/<path>/boot_loader bs=446 count=1\n\n\nA: When booted into windows you could use easy bcd to recover the windows MBR but being also able to get a menu to choose between windows and ubuntu.\n\nA: I ran into the same problem after installing xampp on the windows partition of a dual boot Windows 7/Debian system. Grub then stopped functioning and looped back on itself. Difficult to say what the cause is, since there was an automatic windows update during the same period. Super Grub Disk from supergrubdisk.org was able to recover the windows os, but Debian has disappeared.

Any help would be greatly appreciated. I'm using Ubuntu 11.10. \nThanks!\n\nA: The display probably shows up as \"Unknown\" because you are using the proprietary Nvidia drivers, which do not fully support the RandR extension.  You should still be able to associate a colour profile with the display though.\nAs far as creating a profile goes, you've got two options:\n\n\n*\n\n*See if the display manufacturer provides an ICC profile for your display and add that.  This will only be an approximation, since different batches of the same model can differ slightly and a display can change over time.\n\n*Use a supported colour calibration device to create a profile for your display.  This will give the best results, but you will need the extra hardware.  A relatively inexpensive device is the ColorHug, which was developed by the author of the colour calibration control panel.\n\nA: Gnome Color doesn't work correctly with Nvidia driver.\nIf you want it to work as intended , you have to remove the Nvidia driver and replace by Nouveau.

My /home partition consists of an entire physical disk. It is formatted as btrfs. I want to snapshot it. I'm confused regarding subvolume naming, in particular.\nI am aware that there are similar questions, but each similar question seems to be asking something different from what I'm asking (and they are older, which means probably outdated, given the rapid development of btrfs). For example, the answer to this question is apparently not the answer to my question because my /home partition is a separate volume and the man page for btrfs shows a different command for creating snapshots now.\nanother similar problem, no solid solution.\nsomeone else as confused as me on the naming issues\nMy question:\nStarting simple: is this the correct command to take a simple snapshot of my home partition?\nbtrfs subvolume snapshot /home/@home /home/@home_snapshot_20120421\n\nI got really brave and tested it and it does not work. The error is error accessing /home/@home. As shown below, @home is listed.\nI'm obviously confused on subvolume names. Do I need to use them in creating snapshots? Some examples show taking snapshots of home using /home as the source parameter, but based on examples of root volumes, it seems to me that I need to use /home/@home. \nWould this command work? And if not, why?\nbtrfs subvolume snapshot /home /home/@home_snapshot_20120421\n\nIs the @ just a naming convention? Is it meaningful at all?\nHere's some output that may be relevant:\nbtrfs subvolume list /home\nID 256 top level 5 path @home\n\nI'm not sure what that means, exactly. When I try btrfs device scan it gives an error (e.g. unable to scan the device /dev/sda1). My file system doesn't have any errors. Everything is fine.\nHere are my partitions. In response to one reply, no /home is not my only btrfs partition.  \n/dev/sda1: (boot partition) TYPE=\"ext2\"  \n/dev/sda2: (root partition) TYPE=\"btrfs\"  \n/dev/sdb1: (home partition) TYPE=\"btrfs\"  \n/dev/sdc1: (shared partition) TYPE=\"btrfs\"  \n/dev/sdc2: TYPE=\"swap\"  \n\n\nA: What is the correct command to create a snapshot of my home partition on Ubuntu 12.04?\nGiven the fact that home is on a btrfs partition and it is mounted as /home, the correct command is:\nsudo btrfs subvolume snapshot /home/ /home/<any_name_you_choose_for_the_snapshot>\n\nHere are my results:\nBefore running the command today:  \n$ btrfs subvolume list /home  \nID 256 top level 5 path @home  \nID 257 top level 5 path @home/@snapshot_20120521_1936\n\nThe command:  \n$ sudo btrfs subvolume snapshot /home/ /home/@snapshot_20120611_1307  \nCreate a snapshot of '/home/' in '/home/@snapshot_20120611_1307'\n\nAfter running the command today:  \n$ btrfs subvolume list /home  \nID 256 top level 5 path @home  \nID 257 top level 5 path @home/@snapshot_20120521_1936  \nID 258 top level 5 path @home/@snapshot_20120611_1307\n\nThe only issue with this method is that snapshots show up when you ls (list) /home.\nThe Ubuntu community Wiki has been updated with a solution for this. Here it is:\nHow to work with snaphots in Ubuntu's layout\nIn order to work with snapshots of / or /home in the Ubuntu layout it is very convenient to mount the btrfs filesystem at a separate location, and work from the top of the btrfs tree, rather than from the mounted subvolumes. <-- that is the solution. Unfortunately, it is not convenient.\nsudo mount /dev/sdX# /mnt\n\nTo create a snapshot use the same syntax I used above:\nsudo btrfs subvolume snapshot /mnt/@ /mnt/@_snapshot\n\nThis will create a snapshot of the @ subvolume named @_snapshot located also in the top of the btrfs tree. Since it is in the top of the tree, it will not show up when listing files in a mounted volume.\nTo roll back to a snapshot, you simply need to change its name to the name that ubuntu mounts and reboot. Here's how to change the name:\nsudo mv /mnt/@ /mnt/@_badroot\nsudo mv /mnt/@_snapshot /mnt/@\n\nTo delete a snapshot use:\nsudo btrfs subvolume delete /mnt/@_badroot\n\nbtrfs snapshots are subvolumes in themselves, and self-contained, deleting the old @ subvolume like this is fine, provided we have a replacement.\nNOTE: The btrfs-tools command set-default will break Ubuntu's layout.\n\nA: Ok first things first: \n\n\n*\n\n*The name of the subvolume you are looking at is @home as shown by btrfs subvolume list /home. It's mounted in /home. @home is the name of the subvolume also it has the ID 256 so most likely only your /home is formated as btrfs.\n\n*Now to create a snapshot of @home you have to issue:\nsudo btrfs subvolume snapshot /home/ /home/@home_snapshot_20120421\n\n*The subvolume can have any name. The @ is Ubuntu's convention at install time. (If you use apt-btrfs-snapshot the root subvolume has to be named @ btw.) The community wiki strongly recommends keeping @ as root and @home as home since it is mounted that way. This is especially important if you want to roll back: You should NOT use btrfs subvolume set-default (not syntax highlited by purpose).\n\n*For btrfs device scan you have to use sudo.\n\n*To delete a subvolume you can use sudo btrfs subvolume delete @home_snapshot_20120421\nAll btrfs commands can be abbreviated as long as they are unambiguous, so for example sudo btrfs device scan can be truncated to sudo btrfs d s, sudo btrfs dev sc or anything in between.\nI hope that answered your questions. There are some tools out there to take regular backups, btrfs-snapshot-rotation is one example. Use those with caution since none of them are really mature or gained enough traction, i.e. they may very well contain bugs.\n\nA: Install the apt-btrfs-snapshot package, and use its subcommands list, snapshot, delete and set-default.\nThis is a script that wraps the lower level btrfs commands.  It works by first mounting the btrfs root filesystem somewhere.  By that I mean the real root, as opposed to the /@ subvolume that is normally mounted as /.  In other words, you need to run mount /dev/sda1 /mnt so you can view the subvolumes that will be listed as /mnt/@, /mnt/@home, and any others you have created.  From there you can btrfs subvolume snapshot /mnt/@home @snapshot-today, which will create a snapshot of /@home named /@snapshot-today.  Compare this with running btrfs subvolume snapshot /home /home/@snapshot_today, which instead creates the snapshot as a child of /@home, hence it shows up when you ls /home and its real name is /@home/@snapshot-today.\nRolling back a snapshot is just a simple rename operation: mv /mnt/@home @backup ; mv /mnt/@snapshot-today @home.  The next time you boot, when it goes to mount /@home in /home, it will find the snapshot.\nIt's a bit tricky to wrap your head around because you have to keep in mind the difference between how btrfs sees things vs how the kernel sees things, which is influenced by the mount options ( the subvol= argument specifically ).\n", "Q: Where do I get a SIS mirage 672 vga driver?

Also install the libbz2-dev package. (You can install both from the command-line by running sudo apt-get update followed by sudo apt-get install qt4-qmake libbz2-dev.)\n\n*If you don't want imgcnv installed in /usr/bin (which is the default location), edit Makefile and change the first line (which reads prefix=/usr). For example, if you want it in /usr/local/bin, which is the normal place for software you build and install from source (and not through Ubuntu's package manager), make this line say prefix=/usr/local. If you want to install imgcnv in your home directory, then create $HOME/bin if it doesn't already exist and edit Makefile's first line to read $HOME.\n\n*Run make.\n\n*Run sudo make install (unless you're installing in your home directory; then run make install).\n\n*Assuming that worked, it's pretty clear the official installation instructions are faulty, so optionally, you may want to report this as a bug to imgcnv's maintainers.\n\n\nThis worked for me to build imgcnv 1.52 on an Ubuntu 11.10 Oneiric Ocelot amd64 (i.e., 64-bit) system. If it doesn't work for you, please comment with details (including error messages and the version and architecture of your Ubuntu system).\nIf it doesn't work for you, you might try deleting your imgcnv folder and starting over, re-extracting the archive. Perhaps running the script manually, as you have done, has messed up something that prevented make from working.\nLonger answer (applies also to similar situations)\nThe standard way to build software from source that has good instructions that work is to follow them. Unfortunately this doesn't.\nThe standard way to build software from source without instructions (or with non-working instructions) is to see if there is a script called configure. If there is, run ./configure --help to see what kind of command-line options it takes. Then run the script, with whatever options are appropriate for your needs. Often you may run ./configure with no options, as the defaults are often acceptable. After running ./configure, you may be given instructions. If you are told to run make, or if you are not given instructions, you should then run make.\nIf there is no configure script (as is the case here), see if there is a file called Makefile. If there is, then run make. (When there is a configure script, this script will often generate the Makefile, or on rare occasion may modify it.) You may first want to edit Makefile to customize options for building or installing. One purpose of a configure script is to render this unnecessary by creating a Makefile that is customized according to your specifications. One of the most commonly customized variables in a makefile is prefix, which controls where the software will be installed. (See the \"Short answer\" above for a specific example of this.)\nRunning ./configure or make will sometimes fail, telling you that you don't have something you need. When that happens, you must install that thing. When I ran make, everything seemed to be going well until it eventually failed because the qmake command was not present on my system. Since qmake is a command, I tried to run it manually, which gave me a detailed message telling me I didn't have it (which I already knew) and what packages I could install to get it. Then I installed one of those packages (qt4-qmake) and ran make again. (If it had been a library or header files, I might have needed to search at http://packages.ubuntu.com to see what provides it.)\nRunning make again will often be able to pick up where it left off (or even if not, then from somewhere later than the beginning). Some software--including imgcnv--can take quite some time to build, so it's a good idea to try to pick up where you left off. Occasionally this causes problems though, so if you run make again and it fails, you can run make distclean to bring things back to the way they were before you ran make, then run make. (If make distclean doesn't work, run make clean.)\nSometimes a source distribution has build scripts, like build-imgcnv-linux.sh in imgcnv. If there are both build scripts and a Makefile, and the documentation doesn't tell you to run a build script manually, it's advisable to try running make first, especially if the instructions tell you to run make install. In a properly set up source distribution that has a Makefile, running make install would do the same thing as running make followed by make install (i.e., it would see that the software hadn't been built yet, and it would build it before attempting to install it). But sometimes that doesn't work, so then you have to run make first.\nIt's advisable to run make before make install anyway, even if you know running make install by itself would take care of the make step automatically. There are three reasons for this:\n\n\n*\n\n*If anything happens during the make step that causes you alarm (even if it isn't an error), you're not installing software that might not be built the way you want it. For example, there could be warnings advising you of potential problems.\n\n*This doesn't apply to imgcnv. But many source distributions come with testsuites to see if the built program is likely to work properly. You can build and run them with either make check or make test. (If the documentation doesn't say anything about them, I recommend trying those commands in that order.) These don't get run automatically by running make install, and while you might be able to just run make check or make test without running make first, that's undesirable because it might not be clear if an error happened while building the software or while building/running the testsuite (which is crucial information for troubleshooting the problem).\n\n*If you're installing the software for the whole system (rather than just your user), which is almost always the default configuration, then make install needs to be run as root. On Ubuntu, the proper way to do this is by running sudo make install instead of make install. But you don't need to actually build the software as root, so you can build the software as yourself with make and then install it as root with sudo make install.\nIf you're sure you want to both build and install (no matter what kind of scary warnings come out of building) and make install doesn't work, you can use the idiom make && make install. This also addresses the root/non-root issue, as you can run make && sudo make install. The && operator, used in this way, causes the command to the right of it to run only if the command to the left of it seems to have succeeded.\n(I've intentionally left out discussion of how to build software that requires the user to invoke autoconf, automake, and/or an autogen.sh script, as source code of stable releases very rarely requires this. However, if someone wants to edit this post an add instructions covering those situations, under a third subject heading, I would have no objection.)\n", "Q: what is the web address where my files are stored on Ubuntu One?

So far, so good...\nThe problem is... Super alone is used in Unity to show the Launcher! So when you Super+Tab, then release Tab (or let both pressed for a while), Super will trigger the launcher and \"steal\" the focus away from the ring/shift switcher, so they won't detect they key release and thus not will not select the current window.\nAnd there are 2 solutions to solve the conflict. You either:\n\n\n*\n\n*Disable Unity's Key to show the Launcher, or remap it away from Super\nor\n\n\n*\n\n*Set Shift (or Ring) Switcher to use a different combination other than Super+Tab, something that does not use Super.\n\n*An obvious combo would be Alt+Tab itself, provided you also disable all Key to start the switcher... key bindings in Unity's Switcher settings.

How can I achieve that? \nIs there any tool to do that? \nAnd how can I hide files in ubuntu (except . operator)\n\nA: Tachyons presents a great answer that shows how to hide a partition to udisks applications (such as Dolphin). Relying on a fixed partition name is error-prone though, it's better to use UUID that are unique to a partition. This answer was tested with Kubuntu 13.10.\nTo do so, one first has to find a UUID. That can be found in multiple ways, one of them is by running the command udisksctl info -b /dev/sda1 (where /dev/sda1 is your partition of course). The UUID is visible under IdUUID and the partition is not marked as hidden (ignored):\n\n/org/freedesktop/UDisks2/block_devices/sda1:\n  org.freedesktop.UDisks2.Block:\n    Configuration:              []\n    CryptoBackingDevice:        '/'\n    Device:                     /dev/sda1\n    DeviceNumber:               2049\n    Drive:                      '/org/freedesktop/UDisks2/drives/...'\n    HintAuto:                   false\n    HintIconName:\n    HintIgnore:                 false\n    HintName:\n    HintPartitionable:          true\n    HintSymbolicIconName:\n    HintSystem:                 true\n    Id:                         by-id-ata-...-part1\n    IdLabel:                    SystemReserved\n    IdType:                     ntfs\n    IdUUID:                     A10CDE7682786D73\n    IdUsage:                    filesystem\n    IdVersion:\n    MDRaid:                     '/'\n    MDRaidMember:               '/'\n    PreferredDevice:            /dev/sda1\n    ReadOnly:                   false\n    Size:                       104857600\n    Symlinks:                   /dev/disk/by-id/ata-...-part1\n                                /dev/disk/by-id/wwn-...-part1\n                                /dev/disk/by-label/SystemReserved\n                                /dev/disk/by-uuid/A10CDE7682786D73\n\nNow, in order to hide this partition, create a udev rule that matches the partition by this UUID and hide it from udisks. For instance, if you want to hide the above NTFS partition (with UUID A10CDE7682786D73), and another ext4 partition (with UUID faae2c6a-0545-4bfa-a545-440c63467467), your /etc/udev/rules.d/99-hide-partitions.rules file should contain:\n\n# hide \"SystemReserved\" partition in UI\nSUBSYSTEM==\"block\", ENV{ID_FS_UUID}==\"A10CDE7682786D73\", ENV{UDISKS_IGNORE}=\"1\"\n# hide /home partition in left panel\nSUBSYSTEM==\"block\", ENV{ID_FS_UUID}==\"faae2c6a-0545-4bfa-a545-440c63467467\", ENV{UDISKS_IGNORE}=\"1\"\n\nThe comments are optional, but recommended so that the UUID becomes less magic. Be sure not to mix up = with ==, one sets the variable, the other compares against a variable.\nAfter creating the rules file, apply it by rebooting or by running:\nsudo udevadm control --reload\nsudo udevadm trigger --subsystem-match=block\n\nNow run the udisksctl info -b /dev/sda1 command again and it should contain:\n\n    HintIgnore:                 true\n\n\nA: Thanks for this, very handy tutorial.  I actually found a much easier way to do this in Ubuntu 14.04\n\n\n*\n\n*Hit the super/windows key\n\n*Type and open disks\n\n*Select the partition you want to hide so it becomes orange\n\n*select the cog/settings/advanced settings icon.  Click Edit Mount Options\n\n*Turn auto mount off\n\n*Uncheck both Mount at Startup and Show in user interface\n\n*Save & Reboot\n\n\nNo terminal required,  maybe this is a new feature for 14.04 ?  Not sure either way this was much easier and effective.\nI rebooted again to double check windows system after this task was complete and dual boot worked perfectly.  This is an awesome way if you don't have time to stuff about in case something goes wrong OR if you are still learning the fine art of terminal commands :P\nHope this helps. \nCheers\n\nA: Hiding partitions from Nautilus via »Disks«\nIn Ubuntu 12.10 and onward, there is a utility called Disks which shows all the available disks and allows to modify mount options for each partition.\nAmongst the various options, you can decide if the partition will be mounted at boot time or not, and if it will appear in the user interface.  Admin privileges are needed to apply changes.\n\n\nA: The answer should now be updated.\nYou can follow this guide, but with a difference:\nyou don't have to write this (as was originally written in the other answer)\nKERNEL==\"sda1\", ENV{UDISKS_PRESENTATION_HIDE}=\"1\"\nKERNEL==\"sdb2\", ENV{UDISKS_PRESENTATION_HIDE}=\"1\"\n\nInstead, you should write this:\nKERNEL==\"sda1\", ENV{UDISKS_IGNORE}=\"1\"\nKERNEL==\"sdb2\", ENV{UDISKS_IGNORE}=\"1\"\n\nThe rest is the same :)\n\nA: This guide may help you.\n\nHow do you hide disks from showing up in Nautilus?\nFirst, you must know what disks and/or partitions you want to hide.\n  From what I’ve observed, Nautilus will either present these devices by\n  label. If it does not have a label, then the device will be associated\n  with the disk/partition size.\nLook at the image below. The ones in the red box don’t have labels.\n  File System is always the current /root partition, while the 45 GB\n  File System is a partition that does not have a label. In this\n  example, it is the /root partition of my Ubuntu 10.10 (I’m running\n  on Natty Narwhal but have kept my Maverick Meerkat as a backup of\n  sorts). The other two – Lucid Lynx and Karmic Koala -  are the labels\n  of my 2 NTFS partitions.\n\nThe labels are important in case you are not familiar with how Linux\n  refer to these devices. In Windows, whether it is a disk or a\n  partition, they are called by letters – C or D – and so on. Linux has\n  a more specific naming system. It is normally sdaX or hdbY, where X\n  and Y are the numbers of the partitions on the sda or hdb drives,\n  respectively. Thus, if there are 3 partitions on sda drive, then there\n  will be sda1, sda2 and sda3. Windows will more likely just call it C,\n  D, and E.\nNow mount all of your drives and/or partitions. You know how to do\n  that, don’t you? Click the name in Nautilus and it will mount it for\n  you. I suggest you unmount and remove all removable drives to avoid\n  confusion.\nOnce you’ve mounted all, open a terminal by running gnome-terminal.\n  Just type that in dash if you’re using Natty, or find it in the menu\n  if you’re using the classic Ubuntu desktop. The reason why mounting\n  all is the easier way to find out the device names is because mount\n  will literally tell you that device X is mounted at directory Y with\n  the name Z. Easy right? You can look in /proc/partitions or\n  /dev/disks/ but it will only confuse you.\nRun the command mount once. From the output, take note of the names of\n  the drive or partitions through its associated label. It will look\n  something like the image below.\n\nOn the second image above, you will notice that there is no reference\n  to the mounted 45 GB File System. That is because the latter does not\n  have a label, as I’ve mentioned previously, and the uuid is too long\n  and will look horrible on Nautilus. The underlying system will mount\n  it by its uuid name on /media, while the rest are mounted by its\n  label.\nSince the 45 GB File System (/dev/sdb2) really has no business being\n  displayed on Nautilus, I want to hide that. I also want to hide Karmic\n  Koala (/dev/sda1) because it is my Windows C partition. Heaven\n  forbid I delete files from any of these partitions by accident.\nNow the hiding begins! But before that, make sure you know which\n  partitions you want to hide (like how I identified them above). You\n  can also list all of your partitions using the command sudo fdisk -l\n  to identify them faster. I'm going to be hiding sda1 and sdb2 in\n  the next steps, but you should substitute your partition names\n  instead.\n  \n  \n*\n  \n*Create a file named 99-hide-disks.rules using your favorite editor. This file is where we put the rule to tell the Linux kernel to\n  hide the device. I won’t explain why the file name sounds funny. That\n  will be the subject for another post here if I won’t feel too lazy\n  explaining it.\n  \n*Put the text below in the file you just created, but make sure to change the device name that applies to your case. On mine I want to\n  hide sda1 and sdb2.\nThe general format is (this is case sensitive):\nKERNEL==\"device name\", ENV{UDISKS_PRESENTATION_HIDE}=\"1\"\n\nIn my case, I will write the following in 99-hide-disks.rules:\nKERNEL==\"sda1\", ENV{UDISKS_PRESENTATION_HIDE}=\"1\"\nKERNEL==\"sdb2\", ENV{UDISKS_PRESENTATION_HIDE}=\"1\"\n\nDon’t forget to save when you’re done.\n  \n*Now copy the file to /etc/udev/rules.d/ with the command,\nsudo cp 99-hide-disks.rules  /etc/udev/rules.d/\n\nNow we’re done. This will have been noticed immediately by the system\n  because udev (the device manage for Linux) looks for changes to the\n  rules folder through inotify (this is a file system event notifier\n  service). However it will not be applied until you reboot. Supposedly\n  you can use the udevadm command to trigger the new rules, but I\n  haven’t really tested it yet. Reboot your Ubuntu and notice how the\n  partitions are no longer visible in Nautilus.\nEdit:\nAt least for Ubuntu 12.10, the lines above don't work anymore, and\n  should be changed to use this format instead:\nKERNEL==\"sda1\", ENV{UDISKS_IGNORE}=\"1\"\nKERNEL==\"sdb2\", ENV{UDISKS_IGNORE}=\"1\"\n\n\n\nA: You can't really hide partitions so that they absolutely 100% can't be mounted in Linux, short of physically removing the disks on which they reside. That said, I don't think you need that level of safety. I suspect you just don't want to accidentally click an icon and get into the NTFS partition. To do that, you can edit the /etc/fstab file. Add an entry like this for each partition you want hidden:\nSuppose your ntfs partition is dev/sda1\nThen use this code \n/dev/sda1  /mnt/hidden  ntfs-3g  noauto,ro  0 0\n\n\nThis configures the system to keep /dev/sda1 from being mounted\n  automatically at boot time (the \"noauto\" part of the entry). It also\n  sets it up so that it can be mounted manually at /mnt/hidden, but only\n  as a read-only partition (the \"ro\" option). If you add the \"users\"\n  option (as in \"noauto,ro,users\"), ordinary users (that is, you) will\n  be able to mount the partition; but with this option missing, you'll\n  need to use sudo to mount the partition. It's your choice how far you\n  want to go with this -- you could leave out the \"ro\" and/or add\n   \"users\", for instance.\n\n.\n\nAnd how can i hide files in ubuntu (except . operator)?\n\nSee this Answer\n. \nSource\n\n\n*\n\n*http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?p=9901316\n\nA: In Dolphin, which is not Nautilus but similar application for Kubuntu, I can just right click on the device in the left pane.

It can still be manually mounted elsewhere by root, but not by a standard user by default. If you don't trust root or the system processes, you need to use one of the lower-level kernel approaches.\nTo go further: After that, if you want to mount the block device invisibly, in a container-like approach, you can use unshare:\nunshare -m bash\nMOUNT_DIR=\"XXX\"\nmkdir \"$MOUNT_DIR\"\nmount --bind \"$MOUNT_DIR\" \"$MOUNT_DIR\"\nmount --make-private \"$MOUNT_DIR\"\nmount \"/dev/sdX\" \"$MOUNT_DIR\"\nls \"$MOUNT_DIR\"\n\nBEWARE: Most/all answers, including the udev rule answers, just hide the partition from Nautilus but users can still mount it with  standard permissions, through the Disk utility (► icon).

If it's already mounted, then this command should just silently succeed.\"\nExcept that it requires the password be typed. What should happen is that if your ssh succeeds, you should have access to the decrypted filesystem. So my question is, is there a work-around for this yet? Or lacking one, can someone who is in charge of that particular mechanism fix it to work this way?\n\nA: This is not possible without either extending the SSH protocol, or implementing some other custom protocol.\nFirst of all, the SSH private key is never made available to the system you are logging in to.  Instead, your system signs a challenge with the private key and sends the signed challenge back to the remote system.  Since the remote system has the public key on record, it can verify the signature and be satisfied that you hold the private key.\nIf you use an SSH agent, then it is possible to give the remote host limited access to your private keys by forwarding the agent connection (an act that has some risk: if the remote host has been compromised, they could use the forwarded agent connection to break into other systems you have access to).  But again, this doesn't help since instead of revealing the private key, the SSH agent instead offers an interface for signing data provided by the client.\nThere was an option in the abandoned Secure Shell Authentication Agent Protocol Internet Draft to allow clients to ask the agent to decrypt some provided data, but that is not implemented by either the OpenSSH or Gnome Keyring implementations of the protocol.  And even if it was, this would involve the remote system revealing the eCryptFS passphrase to a remote system, which has its own security considerations.\nAs you can see, it isn't a particularly simple problem, and would be difficult to just bolt onto the side of the existing utilities.\nIf you were happy to store the remote system's passphrase locally, then you might be able to write a script that would decrypt it and pipe it to ssh remotehost ecryptfs-add-passphrase - or similar, which should then allow the encrypted directory to mount.\n", "Q: What is Wine. Is it part of Ubuntu? I want to run MS Office on Ubuntu and have found messages saying you can do it with Wine, but I don't know what Wine is.\n\nA: *\n\n*Wine is a free and open source software application that aims to allow computer programs written for Microsoft Windows to run on Unix-like operating systems. Wine also provides a software library, known as Winelib, against which developers can compile Windows applications to help port them to Unix-like systems.\n\n*Wine is a compatibility layer. It duplicates functions of a Windows computer by providing alternative implementations of the DLLs that Windows programs call, and a process to substitute for the Windows NT kernel. This method of duplication differs from other methods that might also be considered emulation, where Windows programs run in a virtual machine. Wine is predominantly written using black-box testing reverse-engineering, to avoid copyright issues.\n\n*Wine comes in a bundle pack with a separate program known as WineBottler. It basically accomplishes the same task as its counterpart, yet it does so in a more simplified, automatic way. Where as Wine is much more manual requiring the user to input codes to accomplish a task. WineBottler cannot run alone, as it requires Wine to run for some Windows programs.\n\n*The name Wine initially was an acronym for WINdows Emulator. Its\nmeaning later shifted to the recursive backronym, Wine Is Not an\nEmulator in order to differentiate the software from other emulators.\nWhile the name sometimes appears in the forms WINE and wine, the\nproject developers have agreed to standardize on the form Wine.\n\n\n\nIs it a part of ubuntu?\n\nNo. It is an open source application available for ubuntu \n\nInstallation\nHow do I install wine?\nLinks\n\n\n*\n\n*http://www.winehq.org/\n\n*http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wine_%28software%29\n\nA: \nMy first impression is that Wine is a simulated Windows environment which uses free (and presumably open source) libraries as an alternative to Microsoft's proprietary libraries. Those libraries produce the same input and output, yet use alternative means to process the data. This would explain why there is very little performance hit.\n\nYes, that is exactly correct.\nMost people assume it's an emulation layer but it's more of an interpreter, managing where Windows would normally provide resources and mapping that to Ubuntu. Of course there are situations where Ubuntu (and its drivers) don't or can't provide the same resources (like the various Direct3D pipelines) so in cases like those you can often see overhead from the translation process.\nThe biggest case of this is converting Direct3D into OpenGL. It's a process that is very sensitive to latency. This is undergoing huge work right at the moment (the \"CSMT patches\") to multi-thread the OpenGL translation and command streams. IMO it's getting close to native speed.\nBut if you're using a Windows OpenGL application, it's possible you'll see native-like performance.\nThe big outstanding issues in Wine come mostly from needing to reimplement libraries. For gamers this is mostly latest DirectX stuff (DX10 and 11 aren't implemented yet) but there are all sorts of applications that can exhibit strange corner-case bugs.\n\nA: Wine allows you to run windows applications under Ubuntu.\n\nWine (originally an acronym for \"Wine Is Not an Emulator\") is a\n  compatibility layer capable of running Windows applications on several\n  POSIX-compliant operating systems, such as Linux, Mac OSX, & BSD.\n  Instead of simulating internal Windows logic like a virtual machine or\n  emulator, Wine translates Windows API calls into POSIX calls\n  on-the-fly, eliminating the performance and memory penalties of other\n  methods and allowing you to cleanly integrate Windows applications\n  into your desktop.\nWine began in 1993 under the initial coordination of Bob Amstadt as a\n  way to support running Windows 3.1 programs on Linux. Very early on,\n  leadership over Wine's development passed to Alexandre Julliard, who\n  has managed the project ever since. Over the years, as the Windows API\n  and applications have evolved to take advantage of new hardware and\n  software, Wine has adapted to support new features, all while being\n  ported to other OSes, becoming more stable, and providing a better\n  user-experience.\nAn ambitious project by definition, work on Wine would steadily\n  continue for 15 years before the program finally reached v1.0, the\n  first stable release, in 2008. Several releases later, Wine is still\n  under active development today, and although there is more work to be\n  done, millions of people are estimated to use Wine to run their\n  Windows software on the OS of their choice.\n\nFor more info about how to download and install Wine, visit their website.\nSource:Wine\n\nA: In short, WINE is a collection of open source libraries meant to substitute for the Windows API, therefore allowing many, but not all (since WINE is not fully complete yet) Windows programs to run on other operating systems than Windows. \nNevertheless, WINE Is Not an Emulator, meaning it will not enable Windows programs to run on platforms other than the  one they were originally compiled for. Since nearly all Windows programs are exclusively available for the x86 platform, WINE will not be of any use on PPC based Macs, and of very limited use on ARM or IA64 based computers. On AMD64 one can run the x86 version of WINE (given a properly configured Linux kernel and some 32 bit Libraries - Ubuntu comes with both). \nMore infos about WINE can be found on the WINE website:\nhttp://www.winehq.org/about/\nhttp://wiki.winehq.org/Debunking_Wine_Myths\nA list of Windows applications that have been tested with WINE can be found at http://appdb.winehq.org\nThere exist various projects based on or around WINE. A famous tool helping with the installation of Windows programs using WINE is called PlayOnLinux. Especially for beginners this tool comes very handy, because it has a nice graphical user interface and allows easy handling of WINE prefixes, or \"Containers\" in PlayOnLinux terms. A commercial version of WINE with some improvements and a GUI is available under the name CrossOver. The company behind it, CodeWeavers, is one of the driving forces behind WINE development.\nTo install WINE on Ubuntu, one can simply use the packages available in the Ubuntu repositories. if for any reason those are not new enough (meaning, that some program is reported to run with the latest WINE, but does not with the one from Ubuntu), there is also a PPA available on the WINE website, which always contains the latest WINE version.\n\nA: In layman's term it is what helps you run some if not all windows application (exe) in Linux's  environment.\n", "Q: Partitioning Issues So I decided to include my entire HD space of 320GB in the /dev/sda3 partition where I had installed Ubuntu.\nI was told that it is better to keep some HD space away from the installation partition. So I resized the partition to 50GB in order to use the rest to store data.\nI created the partition /dev/sda4 and labeled it as 'Data'.\nHowever, I am unable to copy any data into this folder. When I go to 'Data' I only see the fold 'lost+found'. But I am not able to create any other folder nor can I move my data here.\nHave I done anything wrong?\nAlso I see that 1.75GB of space has already been taken! How can this be possible?\nHere's the screenshot from the GParted Partition Editor.\nhttp://i.stack.imgur.com/CkCQi.png\n\nA: The filesystem will likely have been created and mounted such that only root has write access initially; you probably want to use sudo chown $USER /media/Data to change its ownership, since user-mounting is not useful for partitions on internal drives.\nThe 1.75GB initially taken is filesystem overhead for inodes and backup superblocks.  Linux doesn't try to hide the fact that all filesystems require a certain amount of overhead.\n", "Q: Shutting down via command line causes the system to hang on the shutdown screen I am using Lubuntu 11.10, and the commands:\nsudo shutdown\n\nand\nsudo halt\n\ndo not shutdown my system. Instead the computer hangs at the shutdown screen that appears just before powering off. From that point on it just does nothing. Any ideas on why this happens?\n\nA: My understanding that \"halt\" means exactly the behavior you're observing - all the processes are terminated and the machine is halted (i.e. \"stays stuck ... just before shutting down\") - which was the only possible behaviour in old days when machines had no ACPI capabilities - first you halt the machine and then flip the power switch manually. \nA related command called poweroff gracefully terminates all processes and then issues an ACPI call which powers the machine off.\nHowever, as Rinzwind points out, the exact behaviour of halt command can be changed by editing /etc/default/halt, so it is possible to make it to behave like poweroff. \nTry\nsudo poweroff\n\nor\nsudo shutdown -P now\n\n\nA: Check the file /etc/default/halt This file contains a variable setting that tells halt how it should behave.\nOPTIONS\n\n   The following variables can be set.\n\n   HALT   If set to poweroff the system will be powered down after it  has\n          been brought down. This is the default.\n          If  set to halt the system will only be halted after it has been\n          brought down. What exactly this means depends on your hardware.\n\n   NETDOWN\n          Setting this to no prevents  shutdown  from  shutting  down  the\n          network  intefaces.   This  is  necessary  to  use  Wake-On-Lan.\n          Setting it to yes causes shutdown to also bring down the network\n          interfaces  (and  thus  prevent  the machine from being woken up\n          remotely).\n\nHALT is probably set to halt instead of poweroff.\nFrom my system:  more /etc/default/halt\n# Default behaviour of shutdown -h / halt. Set to \"halt\" or \"poweroff\".\nHALT=poweroff\n\n\nA: I always use shutdown -h now.\n\nA: Halt and poweroff \nsudo shutdown -hP now\n\n\nA: The simple thing to do is follow the directions below.

If so, how?\nOr... Is this a permissions thing where I need to add my user account to the VMWare group of something like that?\n\nA: I guess the problem is that the host (Ubuntu) claims the device as soon as you plug it in - at least thats what happens for me (VMWare Workstation 8).

I was just installing 12.04 beta2 when I noticed something really odd. I was at the screen where you enter your username/hostname/password/etc. I typed 'Me' for my real name as I normally do. This is the weird part. The installer filled in the hostname as 'me-###-##5-1544' where the ###-##5-1544 is my parent's land-line phone number (about two hundred miles west of where i am). Where did the installer get that number? I am installing over a previous install of ubuntu, but that was a throw-away install that I never put that number on. I have other partitions and other OSes on this hard drive, but none were mounted at the time of install and none were selected to be used as mount points in the previous screen.\nPicture of what I'm talking about:\n\n\nA: What the installer does is getting your computers name. It's pretty strange that it's this telephone number, normally it's something like Acer-Aspire-X3300.\nPerhaps your computers vendor got that telephone number and made it the computers name (I have no idea if some do this intentionally, else it could've been a mistake), or someone edited the name (perhaps it's a special BIOS feature on some Computers).\n", "Q: New Ubuntu user, wireless connection - firefox won't work I'm new to linux.

One of the options offered when you right click the desktop or within a Nautilus window is \"wipe available diskspace.\" I'd think that means all unused diskspace but assumptions can be dangerous. I don't want to try it only to find out that available meant \"all\". I can't remember seeing this option before 12.04.\nI was asked to provide an image but unfortunately when right clicking to get the drop down menu, the print screen function doesn't respond thereby making an image impossible.\nIt appears that no responder so far has actually used this nautilus option. Jorge suggested that the feature was actually nautilus-wipe and I verified that is the case by removing nautilus-wipe and seeing that the menu option is now gone.

This doesn't leave me with a warm and fuzzy feeling regarding my using an application or feature that purports to \"wipe disk\" without a clear definition of what is wiped.\n\nA: I think you are correct. It would wipe the available disk space and not system files or personal files. Unless wipe has changed from the days of 9.10 it \"should\" be fine to use. As a side note, there are other utilities in the repos that work like bleachbit if security is a factor for you.\n\nA: Maybe I can help:\nFirst, this page does a decent job of describing the two options; it's from a live Debian disk called Tails that's designed for incognito security.\nSecurely clean available disk space\nSecond, I went ahead and tested the Nautilus \"Wipe available diskspace\" option on a USB key with a live distro of Ubuntu on it. \n\n\n*\n\n*All of the empty space was securely zeroed out.\n\n*None of the live disk files that were already on the USB key were touched.\n\n\nIn other words, here's what's happening: When you delete/trash a regular file, it's no longer available, but the content still resides on your disk until it is over-written with new content. So you can't see the data, but it's not actually gone, and is still recoverable. (If you've ever had to use recovery software, you may have found loads of old files you thought were long gone.)\nThe \"Wipe available diskspace\" option simply looks at all of the empty/non-used space on a volume, and over-writes that space with zeroes and random data. That means any previously-deleted data that might still be sitting around on the disk will now be unrecoverable. However, the \"Wipe available diskspace\" option does not seem to touch any of the currently-visible and available data.\nI hope this helps, but just to be safe, always be sure to back up your necessary data first.\n(I'm curious about the differences, if any, between \"Wipe\" and \"Shred\".)\n", "Q: How to check when was the last time anacron successfully run?

Well, since I was so stupid to install the java via terminal with official package, it stuck on the licence agreement screen, because I had to accept it, but no key from my keyboard worked to accept. So I've closed the terminal, killing my install. Now it says in newly opened terminal java is installed, but does not display in software center. The problem is, I want to uninstall it to get to the software center one. \nSome more info: \nWhy do I want java actually? Because I recently upgraded my graphicscard from onboard to radeon. So, my MineCraft would actually load up, but as soon as it has to load a map, it crashes. I looked in the log file it leaves behind, I don´t see any issues with my graphics, it says there is something wrong with my java. Can´t post output here because I've deleted the files. Since java isn´t working, I cannot create a new one. On my onboard card it worked, but it doesn't play good because that thing came out of '06. So since I've installed my official radeon drivers and plugged in my card it stopped working. My graphicscard isn´t broken too, because it still worked in Win 7. I had working the openjdk runtime 6 (which I meant in previous part too) on my onboard. I had to uninstall that, and install the official, which I think was the most worse choice, because I also could have reinstalled runtime 6 or even 7 from software center. \nMaybe the output from java -version could be handy:\njava version \"1.6.0_23\" \nOpenJDK Runtime Environment (IcedTea6 1.11pre) (6b23~pre11-0ubuntu1.11.10.2)\nOpenJDK Client VM (build 20.0-b11, mixed mode, sharing)\n\nSo, how could I uninstall an unfinished! install of java via terminal?\nIf needing more info, just ask for it!\n\nA: you've installed the packages: sun-java6-jdk and  sun-java6-plugin. to remove them just type: \n\n\n*\n\n*sudo apt-get purge sun-java6-jdk sun-java6-plugin\nif you want to install them again, then just type \n\n\n*\n\n*sudo apt-get install sun-java6-jdk sun-java6-plugin\nthe purge command removes everything there is and clear all config files of those programs, so if you have a broken install a purge + a new install is recommended. \n", "Q: is there a simple way to check a live CD for errors? I was trying to use 2 methods \"HOWTOMD5SUM\" and \"HOWTOSHA256SUM\", but they are all way complicated for a newbie. Is there an application that could do the same in a simple way? I've already tried \"checksum calculator\" too, but it seems to work on iso files, not on live CDs.\n\nA: How about choosing the  \"Check CD for defects\" from the boot menu? :)\n\nThis is an screenshot from an old Ubuntu version, in newer versions you have to hit Enter during the boot process when you see this screen to see this menu:\n\n\nA: md5 checking is not only used to check for errors, but to check for authenticity. You could have a cd that does not have errors, but that is non-authentic... ie., a hacked copy. It could also be a case that your download did not complete properly. It is possible to use the md5sum to ensure that what you are burning is valid and a complete copy. If you had an .iso that was not valid you could end up with a CD that would not boot (depends on where the error was in the downloaded file).\nTo check the md5sum of the .iso file you would:\n\nmd5sum nameoffile.iso\n\nexample:\n$ md5sum precise-server-amd64.iso\n6cac02eb0b97633d3db3c86f1cf9a117  precise-server-amd64.iso\n\nYou then take the result - 6cac02eb0b97633d3db3c86f1cf9a117 and compare it to themd5sum listed on the download page.\nexample:\nhttp://cdimage.ubuntu.com/daily-live/current/\n59e51de80a7a047841fbe59521720e89 *precise-server-amd64+mac.iso\n76e88c3e5dcfd5c887b1668cf2f26867 *precise-server-amd64.iso\neb8afa349ad92ad7c3c8088a94b5937b *precise-server-i386.iso\n79d52f0ad383a53bffee7ccce909205c *precise-server-powerpc.iso\n\nYou can see that the md5sum is not the same as the one I generated.

From the GConf key description:\n\nThe window focus mode indicates how windows are activated. It has three possible values; \"click\" means windows must be clicked in order to focus them, \"sloppy\" means windows are focused when the mouse enters the window, and \"mouse\" means windows are focused when the mouse enters the window and unfocused when the mouse leaves the window.\n\nWhen I configure focus_mode using gconf-editor, /apps/metacity/general/focus_mode, I can't tell the difference between mouse and sloppy.\nWhen I set this key as mouse, the focus is still on that window if I hover the cursor to the background.\n\nA: The mouse mode will set focus on the desktop when the mouse hovers over a desktop area that has no open window, whereas the sloppy mode does not.  The sloppy mode changes focus only if the mouse hovers over a window.\n\nA: May be you can learn from this question:Focus Follows Mouse or Sloppy Focus on Mac OS X\n\nWhat is it?

What went wrong?\n\nA: gnome-shell requires some level of 3D hardware-acceleration to work.\nIt doesn't have to be special hardware - integrated graphics should in almost all cases be fine.  But 3D acceleration must be working.\nGnome 3's window manager, mutter, is a compositing window manager that is OpenGL accelerated.\nIf gnome-shell doesn't detect that you have the right capabilities, it'll load into a \"fallback mode\" which means it loads an old-style panel that looks like Gnome 2 and it doesn't use a compositing window manager.\nUbuntu has helpful ways of installing proprietary drivers for graphics - have you tried these?\n\nA: What the OP is seeing is the \"old gnome 3\". Gnome 3.4 is using llvmpipe to support older hardware.\nHere is what gnome-shell now looks like in fallback mode (screenshot is taken with an intel GMA500 using the psb_gfx driver, which is 2d only).\n\nAs of my post today, the latest versions of gnome-shell and llvmpipe have not yet been fully ported to Ubuntu or a ppa.\nThere is a ppa for llvmpipe, but because llvmpipe is under rapid development it is currently better to build it from source (git).\nSee How to install LLVMpipe?\n\nA: I had the same problem.

I did not have the problem with Lucid Lynx (Ubuntu 10.04), but maybe it just comes from the fact that someone else had installed it for me, and possibly it configured better.\nWhen I print a pdf, even 2 pages, my printer (SHARP MX 2300N) stays in rippen for hours. \"Rippen\" is a German word, not really sure how to translate. Google translate says, The English equivalent is \"Rib\". And eventually, sometimes, the pages finally get printed. But in between my whole floor is very angry because they also need the printer.

Why is this? Are the contacts not loaded at the point the extension is executed? Is the contact search provider somehow not connected up to me? How can I work around it?\n\nA: I asked this on the gnome-shell mailing list -- it turns out that the extensions are loaded quite early on in the piece, before the a user's contacts have properly been loaded.\nAdding a 5-second delay to the code snippet that retrieves the contact list (to give the system a chance to load all the contacts) works a charm.\n", "Q: New mouse cursor doesn't appear in list sudo update-alternatives --config x-cursor-theme I tried installing a new mouse cursor and put the unzipp/tarred file in the folder named ~/.icons. \nI selected the theme with gnome-tweak-tool, but it won't change properly. The default cursor doesn't change, all the rest does though. I've tried this method (and many others now) of manually adding it through gksu gedit /usr/share/icons/default/index.theme. I've tried it with gnome-tweak-tool, with ubuntu tweak, with gconf-editor and even sudo update-alternatives --config x-cursor-theme, but when I try this method my mouse cursor doesn't even appear in the list. How can I add my new mouse cursor to this list?\n\nA: I believe you have to move your theme to the /usr/share/icons directory for it to work.\nAlso you have to locate the index.theme (or any .theme file) of the theme you want to install and add it to update-alternatives using the --install option. \nLet's take as example the theme ComixCursors-LH-White-Small ( a left-handed cursor theme from the package comixcursors-lefthanded ). Its index.theme file looks like\n[Icon Theme]\nName = Comix Cursor LH White Small Bold\nComment = The left-handed Comix Cursors - White Small Bold\nExample = default\n\nbut it should have an Inherits line equal to the directory in /usr/share/icons in which the theme is saved, otherwise it won't work. So add\nInherits = ComixCursors-LH-White-Small\n\nNow tell update-alternatives about your new theme\nsudo update-alternatives --install /usr/share/icons/default/index.theme x-cursor-theme /usr/share/icons/ComixCursors-LH-White-Small/index.theme 91\n\nwhere you should change the second last parameter to the index.theme of your theme. If you did this correctly \nsudo update-alternatives --config x-cursor-theme\n\nshould display your new theme, and after logging out and in, your new theme should be applied.\n\nA: Alternatives available for update-alternatives need to be set up prior to use. This is normaly done by the package scripts. You can add your theme as an alternative like so:\nupdate-alternatives --install /usr/share/icons/default/index.theme x-icon-theme /usr/share/icons/$YOURTHEME/cursor.theme 9999\n\nor you can just link your file to /usr/share/icons/default/index.theme and forget about the alternatives system.\n", "Q: Is there a Quickly command to completely remove a project I am trying out application development with Quickly but I have a couple of projects that I have come to nothing and I want to completely remove them.   \nIs there a command to do that?\n\nA: I do not now if my approach is the best practice!\nBut if you have performed a quickly install in the directory beforehand! \nThen i would cd to the directory and run : quickly uninstall \nThen  cd ..   and do rm -rf  . \nThis approach works for me! ;)\n\nA: I assume that all project files are stored in one folder.\nThe following command wil do the trick\n# rm -rv /path/to/project/folder\n\n", "Q: How to partition the hard drive and with which file system? I have a 238 GB formatted HDD, and 3GB of RAM. I am thinking a 20-30 GB OS partition, and NTFS for data for obvious reasons.\nAny suggestions?\n\nA: Before you add the NTFS partition, you are going to install Ubuntu. First, you need to visit http://www.ubuntu.com/download, select Try it from a CD or USB stick, then follow the instructions to make a CD, if at all possible, or a USB. After you have created an Ubuntu USB or CD, insert the CD or USB into your computer, and then restart your computer. It should automatically boot into the USB or CD, where you will be presented with a screen that looks like this:\n\nYou will want to select Install Ubuntu. Then, you will be presented with a screen that looks like this:\n\nEnsure that you see two green check marks. Then, check the two checkboxes and press Continue.\nThen, select Something Else from the screen that appears.\n\nAssuming that your hard drive is blank, you should see a screen similar to the one below. You will need to select New Partition Table, then add a partiton for Ubuntu. If you want a 20 Gigabyte partition, you shoudl enter 20480 megabytes as the size. For Use As, you will want to select Ext4 Journaling System, and for the Mount Point enter a forward slash  /. Then, click Install Now, and continue with the rest of the installation. Note that my screenshot will look different from your, as I have a different hard disk.\n\nOnce you have completed the installation and booted into your new Ubuntu installation, it is time to add the NTFS partition. Open up a Terminal window, and run the following commands:\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get install -y gparted\nYou will need to enter your password when prompted.\nAfter these commands have finished, open up Gparted. After you enter your password, you will see a screen similar to this:\n\nIn this case, my screenshot will differ significantly from yours, as your hard drive will only have one partition at this point. Underneath the word Partition, click the the word unallocated, which on your screen should be the second item underneath the word partition. Next, click on the plus icon in the top left-hand corner, under the word Gparted. In my screenshot, I had to select Logical Partition, but you should select Primary Partition. You will want to set File System to ntfs, and New Size to the size to mebibytes that you want the partition to be. You can Google the appropriate conversion you need to preform. For example, typing in, '20 Gigiabytes in mebibytes' will give you the number of mebibytes in 20 gigabytes. If you want to fillw up the entire disk with the partition, just drag the arrow pointing the right all the way to the right side of the window. You can leave everything else as it is. When you are finished, click Add, then click Edit > Apply All Operations. wait for the partition to be created before closing Gparted. You're done!\n\n", "Q: Accidently deletetd .ecryptfs folder - cant log in anympre I accidently deleted the .ecryptfs folder, also the .private folder. Cant login anymore. Just as guest.

If you have that long, random passphrase, it's relatively easy to recover.  If you don't have that, there's no chance of recovery.\nIf you have your randomly generated mount passphrase, you'll recreate your .ecryptfs directory.\nmkdir $HOME/.ecryptfs\necryptfs-add-passphrase --fnek\n[enter your long, random mount passphrase]\nkeyctl list @u\n[add the two key fingerprints to $HOME/.ecryptfs/Private.sig]\necryptfs-wrap-passphrase $HOME/.ecryptfs/wrapped-passphrase\necho $HOME > $HOME/.ecryptfs/Private.mnt\n\n\nA: The only way you can restore your drive is to have the mount passphrase, which is a 16, 32, or 64 character string provided to you at the time of encryption. If you did not save that string, your data is lost. To make the walk-through easier, we assume you created a new file called /home/USER/mountkey and stored the above passphrase in there. In the bash snippets below, replace USER with your username.\nIf you have that passphrase, here are the steps:\nmkdir /home/USER/.ecryptfs\ntouch /home/USER/.ecryptfs/Private.sig\necryptfs-add-passphrase --fnek\n\nYou will be asked to enter the passphrase. Upon doing so, you will be provided with two sig keys. Store the two keys in two separate lines in /home/USER/.ecryptfs/Private.sig (If you missed these keys, you can retrieve them by running keyctl list @u).\nNow, run the following:\ncat /home/USER/mountkey <(echo \"ORIGINAL_PASSWORD\") | ecryptfs-wrap-passphrase /home/USER/.ecryptfs/wrapped-passphrase\n\nIn the above, the ORIGINAL_PASSWORD is whatever password you originally used to encrypt your hard drive. There is good chance you used the same password as your login password, but this is not necessarily true. The ORIGINAL_PASSWORD is also different from the passphrase stated in the beginning which is a 16, 32, or 64 alphanumerical string.\nNow you need to specify where to mount your home drive, and to activate automatic mounting:\n/home/USER/ > /home/USER/.ecryptfs/Private.mnt\ntouch /home/USER/.ecryptfs/auto-mount\ntouch /home/USER/.ecryptfs/auto-umount\n\n", "Q: Overscan Compensation Disabled A fresh install of 12.04.

Acer 5750 I bought a new laptop, Acer 5750 and installed Ubuntu 11.10 on it.\nNow I would like to know what graphic driver should I install for it. When I go to 'Aditional Drivers', it does not show any graphic drivers to be activated.\nMy graphic card is: Intel HD Graphics 3000.\nThanks in advance. :)\n\nA: Your drivers are included with the kernel. For this reason you do not have to install any proprietary drivers via 'Additional Drivers'.\nIf you would like you can add the following:\n\nsudo apt-get install mesa-utils\n\nThis will enable information to be displayed about your drivers in System Information.\nI have never bothered though so it is totally optional to do so.\n\nA: Intel graphics drivers are open source and already included. If you'd like to test newer drivers, you can add Fabio Pedretti's \"Updated and Optimized Graphics Drivers\" PPA. Be aware that these drivers may be less stable than your current drivers. If you install the PPA, update your system and you're happy with the new drivers, you may wish to disable the PPA in Software Sources to prevent a future update from breaking things - this has happened to me before.\nEntering this in the terminal will add the repository and upgrade all packages on your system to the latest version:\nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:oibaf/graphics-drivers -y && sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get upgrade -y\n\n", "Q: Wireless does not detect network on an Acer 5750 with a Broadcom 43227 I've installed Ubuntu 11.10 on my laptop Acer 5750.

System specs:  \n\n80GB HDD\n  2GB RAM.\n\n\nA: The installation will give you a few choices:  \n(1) Use the entire disk, which will delete the data.  Don't use this option; \n(2) Install Ubuntu to a new partition along with existing partitions, which will not erase anything, but may not do exactly what you want.  I believe it will (perhaps only sometimes) resize an existing partition to make room for Ubuntu.  \n(3)  \"Something else\", which is the manual method, and is the one I always use.  But it requires slight knowledge of the current setup, which you probably have since you have multiple partitions.\nI suggest using option 3, but if you are not sure along the way, you should stop the installation, unless you have a good backup.  But it's not too hard, especially if you prepare yourself first with a little information... such as:\nBoot the Ubuntu Live CD, but choose the option to try it out without installing yet.\nOnce it's running, run the program \"gparted\" from the menu.  This is a very nice GUI partitioning programming, which is good for visually seeing the partitions and data.\nIt will probably be showing the CD layout by default, so you'll have to change the combobox at the top to show your hard drive, which should be named \"sda\".  The partitions are numbered as sda1, sda2, sda3, etc.  The order is the order they are created, and it's not necessarily consecutive.  Anyway, you should identify the XP partition and remember it so you can reuse it for Ubuntu.\nYou will need a small swap partition of 3 or 4 GB.  If you have extra space on any partitions, you could resize one and create it now.  It doesn't matter where it is.\nWhen you've identified the partition for Ubuntu (most likely sda1 if you are over-writing XP), you can choose the option to install Ubuntu onto sda1.  Probably best to choose ext4, and format the partition.\nI've left out a bit of detail, as I'm not sure how much you need.  Feel free to ask any questions if you're unsure of anything, and if you feel uncomfortable along the way, just don't continue, and no harm will be done.  Also, you should be able to use the install CD to run a browser (you can verify this before installing), so if something goes wrong, you can at least still research or ask questions.\nHope this helps.\n\nA: Your easiest way will be this: \n\n\n*\n\n*First In Windows XP, give the XP partition a label or name. For example, let it be \"XP\". You can do this, by Right clicking on the XP partition and select properties.\n\n*Boot to the Ubuntu using Live CD or USB.\n\n*Open a terminal by pressing Ctrl-Alt-T\n\n*Type sudo blkid and press Enter\n\n*See an entry with this kind of text LABEL=XP. Note the /dev/sdxX value. for example, it can be /dev/sda1 or /dev/sda2. \n\n*Now Click on the Install Ubuntu icon on the Desktop\n\n*Provide necessary information until you reached at partitioning stage.\n\n*There will be three options Install Ubuntu with Windows side by side , Completely erase hard disk and install Ubuntu, Something else. Choose Something else\n\n*In the next page, you will be shown partitions of your hard disk\n\n*Select your Windows partition you determined with sudo blkid command.\n\n*Select or Press Edit button\n\n*Change Don't use this partition to ext4. i.e change partition type\n\n*change the mount point to /  then Press OK\n\n*A new partition in the place of your previous Windows partition will be created\n\n*Now, Click next to provide other necessary information to complete installation.\nNotice that, I haven't created any swap partition during installation. But, You need to create swap after installation is completed. See the below question link to get a help.\n\n\n*\n\n*How do I add a swap partition after system installation?\nNote: If you have important files in the Windows partition, please make a backup of necessary files.\n\nA: If you don't want your data to be erased but want to install Ubuntu over XP, you need to backup your data. You could also keep your old partition(s) but I don't recommend that. Copy your data to an external drive, choose \"Use the entire Disk\" and then copy the data back to your internal hard disk.\n", "Q: Why SoundJuicer and Rythmbox don't allow me to tweak the cd ripping profiles?

I wonder where does Ubuntu/eCryptfs store decrypted files from encrypted $HOME directory during runtime. \n\n\n*\n\n*Does it decrypt files just-in-time and store them only in RAM? \n\n*What about large files (e.g. 1080p movies with 20Gb)?\n\n*Is it possible that there are some decrypted files left on HDD after system shutdown?\n\n*Does the decrypting/encrypting affect OS performance significantly?\n\n\nA: Decrypted files are stored in RAM. The decryption (or encryption, when writing) happens on the fly, block by block and not for a whole file at once. When an application reads a block from the file, the file is decrypted by a layer between the disk driver and the filesystem driver.\nDecrypted files are not written to disk, but an application could write data to a non-encrypted filesystem. In particular, if you have encrypted filesystems, you should encrypt your swap space, since the data in application memory can end up in the swap space. You should also encrypt directories that applications use for temporary storage, such as /tmp (which can be made tmpfs and so be stored in the swap space), /var/tmp, /var/spool/postfix (emails), /var/spool/cups (documents being printed), etc.\nWhether the encryption affects performance depends a lot on the ratio between processor speed and disk speed. With slow disks and a fast processor, you won't notice anything. With a slow processor and very fast disks, you'll feel the pain. Recent Intel and AMD processors have hardware accelerators for AES (AES-NI) which recent Linux kernels take advantage of.\n", "Q: Updating server to 12.04 on release I'm currently running a lamp server using Ubuntu 11.10.

It changes permissions. chown changes owner (and group if need be) and chgrp changes group.\nYou can use\nchown {-R} [user]{:group} [file|directory]\n\nto set user and group ownership where -R does everything that is inside directory.\nSo sudo chown -R rinzwind:rinzwind /tmp/ would set /tmp/ and everything in it to user rinzwind and group rinzwind.\nThere is also \nchgrp {-R} [group] [file|directory]\n\nif you do not need to touch the user permissions and only need to set the group.\nOh and you can check what group a user belongs to with groups {username}.\n", "Q: Is there a cataloging software that links with Goodreads?

How can I host a domain/website on my new VPS? How to have a nameserver? How to setup the nameserver?\n\nA: There are many \"reasonable\" and \"practical\" ways to go about hosting a website using your domain name on a VPS running Ubuntu.\nI offer this guide for a straight-forward walkthrough on setting up a hardened Ubuntu LAMP Server to power a site:\nhttp://blog.al4.co.nz/2011/05/setting-up-a-secure-ubuntu-lamp-server/\nIn regards to setting up a Nameserver.... Just don't do that :) use the free dns services offered by most registrars or use a service like Afraid.org or Cloudflare to handle DNS. \n\nA: To setup DNS server, you'll need to install a DNS server such as Bind.  See instruction here https://help.ubuntu.com/community/BIND9ServerHowto\nHowever, like the other user suggested, you may want to just use the DNS service provided by a 3rd party since you will need at least 2 DNS servers, primary and secondary for it to work \"properly\".

I want to install Ubuntu for the first time in my notebook, is this necessary to partition my whole hard disk to install Ubuntu or just the C drive or any one (like installing windows 7 or others)? I don't want to lose all my data... \n\nA: The installer provides alternative ways to install Ubuntu. It can resize an existing Windows partition and install it along it allowing you to dual-boot. Or it can use the whole disk in which case it will use one partition for system and data. Or you can specify partitions manually.\nIf you want to divide your \"system\" and \"data\" on Ubuntu on separate partitions similar to the C: and D: paradigm on Windows, you can do that by making two partitions. Both need to be Ext4. The \"system\" one needs to be larger than 10GB, 20GB is probably enough for absolutely anything whereas 15GB should be a good average. The rest of the space goes for the \"data\" partition. Once you have the two partitions, use manual partitioning and tell the Ubuntu installer to use the \"system\" one at the \"/\" mount point and the \"data\" one at the \"/home\" mount point.\nNote that once you to tell the Ubuntu installer to use manual partitioning you have to also specify a Swap partition. That can be any partition with larger size than your physical RAM and type swap. Some people recommend double the RAM but that could be an overkill nowadays. Once you have a swap partition you have to tell the Ubuntu installer to \"Use it as Swap\".\nThat's all. :)\n", "Q: How to find the terminal in Lubuntu? Where can I find the terminal in Lubuntu?

I would like to get a list of packages installed on one system and install all of them on another system. \nI know that dpkg --get-selections can give me a list of all installed packages which I can pipe into dpkg --set-selections on the target system. However, some of the installed packages are ones that I built myself locally (using e.g. checkinstall) and are not available from the repositories. The dpkg --set-selections process will fail when it is unable to find these packages in the repositories. \nSo is there a way I can filter the list generated by dpkg --get-selections so that it only contains packages whose currently-installed version is available in my current repositories?\n\nA: I believe Software Center has a feature for syncing between computers these days. If that handle missing packages correctly, it could solve your problem.\nThe issue here is that dpkg isn't aware of repositories, only installed packages. You can find out if a package is available in a repository by running apt-cache policy $package. If you see a repository in the Version Table, it's available there.\nSo, how about this?. It's slow, but should work:\ndpkg --get-selections '*' \\\n  | while read line; do\n    apt-cache policy $(echo \"$line\" | cut -f1 ) \\\n      | grep -q 'http://' \\\n      && echo \"$line\"\ndone\n\n\nA: Use the following command\ndpkg --get-selections > installed-software\n\nit will create a file called installed-software in your home directory\non the new system \ndpkg --set-selections < installed-software\n\nthis will read the selection and install\n", "Q: How do I backport my favorite package 2-3 times each year? My current favorite game is Simutrans. Debian already picks up new releases, and Ubuntu imports from Debian.\nThe game developers release a new version irregularly every 3-9 months, and most multiplayer servers promptly migrate to the newest version. This means that the Ubuntu version is about one or two releases behind (currently three behind!), and that Ubuntu players cannot use the servers because their client version is too old.\nHow can I get the pre-release version backported to the current release?\nDo I just file a backport request? Every time? (2-3 times each year?)\nHow can I make it easy on the Backporters team?\nIs there a team I should join or permissions I should seek?\nOr some other avenue I should pursue?\n\nA: One of the purposes of a backport request being a bug report on Launchpad that is filed by a specific person, is that this person can (and usually will) indicate that they are able to test backported packages. Thus, by filing the request and testing backported packages as maintainers on the backports team create them, you contribute significantly to the backporting process.\nSince you are, in effect, doing part of the work of backporting by requesting the backport, indicating you can test it, and testing it, it's actually generally easier on the backporters if you file the request each time, because then you are making yourself available to help each time.\nHowever, next time you file a backport request, you may want to indicate in it that you believe the package to be in perpetual need of backporting, and that you are perpetually available to test backports. That way, if there is a more efficient way to deal with this, it will likely be devised by the people who are actually doing the work of backporting (including you).\nThere is a new script in ubuntu-dev-tools starting in 12.04 called requestbackport that will show you what needs to be tested for each backport.  It provides a list with \"checkboxes\" that people can check off as the items are tested.\nUsing the backports repositories as opposed to PPAs for new releases of packages where possible allows users to get the latest version without having to modify their sources.  Starting in 11.10, backports is enabled by default, but given a lower priority than the release packages.  This means that someone has to explicitly choose the backport version if there is the same package in the main repository.\n", "Q: Problem with Ubuntu and loading What is going wrong when, I have to use Ubuntu 2D because, when I try logging into Ubuntu, it loads slow and wont show and side bars or load anything, so if someone could help me, please would be appreciated.

Is it possible to stop Unity from remembering the past search history? If I search for \"settings\" and then close and reopen the unity dash, the word \"settings\" is still in the search bar.

It's not configurable. \nPress Esc to clear the search though. If there's a previous search, the first time you press Esc, you'll empty the input field. The next time you press Esc, you'll close the Dash.\n\nA: In 12.04 there is a tool for privacy under system settings.

I just got a second monitor so I can have dual screens on my desktop computer.  Upgrading to 12.04, using BIOS to set my main graphic processor to \"onboard\", and changing the nvidia x server settings to the \"seperate x screen\" configuration, I was able to succeed in getting Dual Monitors, which I am very proud to have accomplished.  The sacrifice seems to have been that I lost some of the cool effects of the sliders, [alt]+[tab] changer looks like windows 95, the workspace changer doesn't work, I cannot access my display preferences outside of the Nvidia X Server.  When I go to display preferences, I get this pop-up \"Could not get screen information\" \"RANDR extension is not present\".

I have described there how to make work (if possible) two VGA cards.\nAnyway I have tested 10.04 with two nVidia cards and three monitors using Xinerama and it worked absolutely great.\n\nA: Ok so a few things that I realized I was doing backwards.  One was that it was a lot easier to keep the both monitors plugged into the same graphics card.  I went in circles trying to get it to work outside out of the motherboard, so I bit the bullet and got a DVI to VGA adaptor, plugged everything in right and got immediate results.  I went back into BIOS and turned everything back to default settings.  Rebooted and immediately went to the nvidia x server and switched to Twin View.  Everything went back to normal.  Blender worked, workspace switcher was still a little wonky, so I said \"screw it\"  I know what I did wrong, backed up everything, download the new 12.04 installation DVD, and started from scratch.  When it was all installed and most of my files returned to their homes, I knew just what to do and I told NVidia to put everything in Twinview, and its been smooth sailing since.

Can anyone help me get devilspie to work  (its installed but does nothing when I double click, trying to start from terminal closes the terminal but never opens the program, is devil not intended for use on unity or am I missing something?). Gdocsfs gives an error message that the local mount point does not exist [robbie/documents/something]? Are their any other options I can use?\n\nA: My solution was to run Super Flexible Filemanager at startup, then just minimize the thing. It offers two way sync with gdocs and file conversion to gdocs format. Since I have to minimize the thing at startup so it isn't very pretty or silent but at least it gets the job done and gets around the new pricing policy of GDrive (which isn't available to me yet). Converted docs still don't count toward the 5gb limit. SFFM allows me to select which folders I want synced, similar to UbuntuOne and I am going to email the devs to see if Google is going to maintain that 3rd party functionality and to let them know Linux users are using their product and looking for background sync functionality.\nThen I use Conduit (which will run in the background) to sync to Picasa and convert images so a smaller file size. Hopefully, Conduit devs are working on two-way gdocs sync and are upping the size limit to fit new larger Picasa/G+ file sizes (adding G+ would be good too). The privacy concerns of gdocs don't bother me because I know to upload anything sensitive to UbuntuOne or SpiderOak (or better yet just stored on an encrypted USB drive that stays on my car key ring).

The Amarok manual claims:\n\nAmarok automatically shows the tracks from the server in the Media Sources -> Local Music pane and no further configuration is required.\n\nBut Amarok did not automatically work with no configuration:\n\nWhat am I doing wrong?\nI've confirmed that sharing is enabled in iTunes,\n\nand that the share is visible in Rhythmbox,\n\nso I believe the problem is within Amarok.\nHow can I make Amarok connect to the share?\n\nA: The answer is sadly no. This will work between iTunes only.\nIn your link it mentions that the protocol \"...was first used for the iTunes music player\" but did not mention current support for accessing iTunes Shared music.\nFrom: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_Audio_Access_Protocol\n\nBeginning with iTunes 4.2, Apple introduced authentication to DAAP\n  sharing, meaning that the only clients that could connect to iTunes\n  servers were other instances of iTunes. This was further modified in\n  iTunes 4.5 to use a custom hashing algorithm, rather than the standard\n  MD5 function used previously. Both authentication methods were\n  successfully reverse engineered within months of release.[5]\nWith iTunes 7.0, a new 'Client-DAAP-Validation' header hash is needed\n  when connecting to an iTunes 7.0 server. This does not affect\n  third-party DAAP servers, but all current DAAP clients (including\n  official iTunes before iTunes 7.0) will fail to connect to an iTunes\n  7.0 server, receiving a '403 Forbidden' HTTP error. The iTunes 7.0 authentication traffic analysis seem to indicate that a certificate\n  exchange is performed to calculate the hash sent in the\n  'Client-DAAP-Validation' header.\nAs of July 15, 2014, the iTunes 7.0+ DAAP authentication still hasn't\n  been reverse engineered, so no third-party application can stream from\n  servers running iTunes software (from 7.x, all the way up to and\n  including version 11.x)\n\n\nHowever; there are workarounds. (Which means not using iTunes)\nYou can use a diffrent Music Server that uses DAAP to send your music.\nThen direct it to your iTunes music folder, from http://support.apple.com/kb/HT1391 the location of iTunes music (This worked on my mac, however I collected my music through iTunes through CD and not from iTunes store - not sure if it changes anything)\n\nMac OS X: /Users/username/Music/iTunes/\nWindows XP: C:\\Documents and Settings\\username\\My Documents\\My Music\\iTunes\\\nWindows Vista: C:\\Users\\username\\Music\\iTunes\\\nWindows 7: C:\\Users\\username\\My Music\\iTunes\\\nWindows 8: C:\\Users\\username\\My Music\\iTunes\\\n\n\nI tested out firefly for mac (looks like a dead project), but there are other music servers: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_Audio_Access_Protocol listed under DAAP servers\n", "Q: How to disable Usb port?

I will have in a few days this laptop (HP DM4-3060EF Beats Edition) and I want to know if all is working with it. For example, how about HP coolsense ?\nDoes anybody else have the same laptop ?\n\nA: I have the same laptop, been running 12.04 for 5 months or so, all running well, although it took a long time to get the broadcom drivers to work properly, and I think they still don't- connection to APs takes a long time.\n The fingerprint reader has no drivers, and the graphics card drivers need to be installed from the manufacturer, but there is a linux driver.\nSwitche-able graphics never worked right, but I dont care about that so much- usually plugged in.\nUpgrading to 12.10 alpha today, same problems with broadcom, installing graphics now, everything else works(have given up on the fingerprint sensor)\nOverall performance is good, smooth ride.\nPaul\nP.S- Since writing this things have come to light, wireless seems to work out the box, the ATI card has no support- so intel sandybidge is used- but the ATI card is still powered; causing the laptop to overheat and the fan to constantly run (reducing battery)- edit rc.local and add \"echo OFF > /sys/kernel/debug/vgaswitcheroo/switch\" to work arouond this.. it's been more than a year and no fix yet...\nAlso the subwoofer isn't activated because the hd sound model isn't supported- I initially used the model for the dm7 (in alsabase), but this doesnt seem to work in 13.10- if it works for you you need to swap the channels for the front speakers and the subwoofers afterwards...\nPaul\n\nA: Well. Ok i have installed ubuntu on my new laptop.

Instead of asking for a wild guess, you could try to run a liveCD version of Ubuntu, without the need of formatting your hard drive, uninstalling your current Operating System, or falling back to techniques like dual boot, in order to get a good taste of how Ubuntu will run on your computer.\n", "Q: Shortcut to open/focus terminal window I am using shortcut Ctrl+Alt+T for opening a new Terminal window. I am using one of the terminal very often (calculator and simple commands) and I want to set up another shortcut (like Ctrl+Alt+R or any other, I don't care) to switch to this specific terminal window (using gnome-terminal in Unity, Ubuntu 12.04).\nIs this possible (and how)?\n\nA: There is an application called wmctrl, which can help you. You can install wmctrl by command:\n# apt-get install wmctrl\n\nYou can get list of currently existing windows by wmctrl -l and see titles and names of currently existing windows. Using titles, you can raise a window by:\n$ wmctrl -a <string>\n\nTo automatize this procedure, you can start specific gnome-terminal with --title parameter to set its window title. Assuming you've run:\n$ gnome-terminal --title=testing\n\nYou can run:\n$ wmctrl -a \"testing\"\n\nto raise that window, beware of that the string you used to select window should be specific to that window, shouldn't match with any other window's title.\n\nA: I've written a small program called jumpapp for exactly this purpose. It lets you create one keyboard shortcut to opens a new terminal the first time you press it, and to switch to the already open window any time you press it after that. As a bonus, if you have multiple terminal windows open, repeatedly pressing the shortcut will cycle through all the terminal windows.\n\nIt's easy to install from source, or you can install it from my PPA:\nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:mkropat/ppa\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get install jumpapp\n\n", "Q: Install Ubuntu 12.04 via 1GB usb?

Whenever my laptop wakes up from suspend state it just shows me a blank screen. Regardless of whatever I do(move my mouse, press keyboard buttons) it just refuses to wake up. I am forced to do a restart and lose all my unsaved files. Has this issue been reported for Ubuntu 12.04?\nI am using a Lenovo X200 with Intel Mobile 4 Series Graphics Chipset. Please let me know if any body has found a fix for this.\n\nA: I has this issue on my X200. Workaround for me was:\nTurn off screen lock in the \"Brightness and Lock\" settings.\nThe only problem is that it wakes without a password, which isn't too big of a deal for me.\n\nA: I have this problem also, but with a desktop.\n Currently using 12.04 X64 with an onboard AMD graphics and a ASUS 24\" LED screen with HDMI.\nIf the system goes into suspend after 30 min, when I wake it up by keyboard or mouse, the only thing that is seen is the cursor AND my userid in top-right corner.  This will last for about 2 or 3 minutes.\nThe cursor will change, as it is moved across the screen, depending on what  the invisible  contents of the screen are.\nEventually after a few minutes, the screen will re-appear.

Your problem might be different, but it might be worth a try!\n\nA: Same problem here. It's not a problem with the lcd turned off (I know because I have that problem on startup... had it since 11.10) All I see is the white pointer on a blue-black screen. Tried Alt f1-2-3-4 to no avail. Have to force shutdown and reboot.\nEDIT: The problem has magically gone away, after update I suspect : ) It still takes a little more time than it should to connect to the network after login, but that could simply be due to the sequence of actions. Other than that Precise Pangolin is purring like a Kute Kitten. \n\nA: Disable VSync.\nAnyway, in this blank screen, you can type the password and press Enter.\nBut to solve this problem (white blank screen or black blank screen) on screen locker, disable the VSync option on Unity/Compiz or under Desktop Effects on KDE.\n\nA: I managed to fix this on Xubuntu 15.10 by unchecking\nLock screen before sleep under Advanced in the Session and Startup preferences.\n\nA: Here it suggests to disable KMS by booting and passing the option nomodeset to the kernel. \nI tried passing this option temporarily and then add it permanently as explained here. \nFor the impacients:\nsudo -H gedit /etc/default/grub\n\nAt the line beginning with GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT, add nomodeset to the end.

I am trying to convert video to the formats commonly used for HTML5 embedding — that is, MP4 (H264 + AAC), OGV (Theora + Vorbis) and WebM (VP8 + Vorbis). I would like to use a GUI application to do this as simply as possible.\nI have the Medibuntu repository installed, but it doesn't seem to help.

How can I configure these apps under 11.10 for my purposes, or alternatively, what else is there?\n\nA: My answer to this question: How can I maximum compress video files? may be helpful for your case. In this answer I talk about Miksoft's Mobile Media Converter, but there are a few alternatives to this task which can easily be reached over the net. \nAnyway, Mobile Media Converter will only work for 32 bit version OS's. And for both 32/64 bit version I suggest you to give a chance to \nWinFF\n\nTransmaggedon\n\nTranscoder\n\nArista Transcoder\n\nAnd there are some other useful Transcoding Software, which includes Non Linear Editing Systems like those mentioned on the answers to this question: What is an easy video editor? and command line using ffmpeg. (as mentioned by @tomodachi)\nNevertheless, the trick in compression (in order to make the videos lighter when loaded to/from the server) isn't in the software itself but the way you make your videos.\nYou must pay special attention to the Audio and Video Bitrates, which determines both the quality and file size for the resulting transcoded videos and remember that the higher bitrate will result in a higher quality but it will also drop \"heavy\" file sizes.\nYou should run as many tests as you need in order to feel comfortable with both the resulting quality and file size.\nThere is no a pre-defined set of parameters which will do always the same for your videos when you are trying to save something, let's say: quality and file size, or in the worst case: both them.\nThere is no such \"magic codec\" that will result in a better quality with small file sizes. Take in consideration that you could have a mpeg1 video file (VCD) with a high bitrate looking better than an mp4 video file with a lower bitrate.\nAdditionally and only for your consideration:\nThe FileInfo.com webpage related to \"Video Formats\" provides an extensive and really comprehensive list of video formats, its available software which can be used to play each one and the \"popularity\".\nYou may also wish to take a look to the \"Digital Container format\" and the table of \"Comparison of container formats\".\nGood luck!\n- Parts of this answer were took from Reduce avi size without losing too much quality\n\nA: Install ffmpeg from source!

I find Ubuntu 64bit to be a little slow on my notebook with a Core i5 and 2 GB of RAM. Especially alt+tab takes some time to show up sometimes. \nI mostly run Chromium, Thunderbird, LibreOffice Writer, Banshee and pdfviewer. Right now I'm just running the first two plus UbuntuOne in the background and there's 87% RAM used. \nShould I upgrade to 4 GB?\n\nA: You mention you're using 64-bit Ubuntu on a 2GB system. The main advantage of 64-bit is the ability to address more memory, but for 2GB you don't really need it. Another advantage is that 64-bit code is slightly faster to execute, but if you're actually feeling the system be sluggish you  may be hitting the swap file due to memory exhaustion, which negates the speed advantage.\nThe downside is that 64-bit uses up more memory than 32-bit. This is a good tradeoff if you need a system to handle more than 4 GB RAM, but for systems with 3 GB and below, this is a non-issue as 32-bit can do that just fine.\nYour question is whether to upgrade to 4 GB RAM. More memory is always good, but if you don't have a specific need for it, you could instead install Ubuntu 32-bit, which can handle 2 GB just fine, and should be noticeably faster on your system.\n\nA: You can monitor the memory usage by using 'top' command.  If you see the swap is being used often, then adding more RAM will certainly help.\n\nA: Ram is cheep today, if you wait to upgrade prices for your type of ram will raise. I have 8 GB of ram and a SSD on my Core i5 laptop and it's fast, very fast. I can't say that I \"need\" that much memory but Ubuntu will use as much as it can for cache and likely. Memory are newer bad. It cost me less than 5 % of the total price for the notebook (<30 EUR of 700 EUR for an Asus u36jc 2011) for the upgrade from 2 to 8 GB, SSD was more expensive about 80 EUR.  \nStarting libreoffice takes abount 0.3 sec\naw@U36JC:~$ time libreoffice --writer --terminate_after_init\n\nreal    0m0.217s\nuser    0m0.196s\nsys 0m0.048s\n\nBoot-time are 3 sec to 7 sec except for time in BIOS, despite that I have a LAMP, Postgresql and an OpenERP that has to start on every boot too.\n\nA: If you switched to firefox your memory footprint would drop significantly. Sandboxing every website is expensive, and FF can sandbox plugins now so its much more robust. If switching browsers is a no go you can tweak chrome with undocumented switches that change the memory model like --single-process or --process-per-site.\nIf it comes to opening your wallet, and it's an exclusive choice, an SSD will give you a nice overall performance increase.\n", "Q: Recovering Very Important Lost Data From Ntfs Partition I have a 230 Gigs HDD on my laptop,\ni have 50 gigs extended for my linux,\ni have 80 gigs empty ntfs partition,\nand 100 gigs ntfs partition where i store all my important data, (i have about 50 gigs of important things)\ntoday i mounted the 100 gigs partition took something from it, unmounted it back,\nand then when i mounted it again it was EMPTY !!!\nall the data is gone !!!!\ni used to mount it via the terminal : sudo mount ntfs /dev/sda5 /media/E\nwhere E is a dir that i make (when i make it i change the permissions of media to 777 then after creating the dir, i change it back to normal)\nGuys you cant imagine how much this data is important to me, Plz HelP, \nthnx in advance\n\nA: If the data is REALLY important.

Or to revert the background back when the computer reboots?\n\nA: The new dconf has options for lockdown and also has an example (where they use the wallpaper ;)) on the dconf system admin page:\n\nLockdown\nLockdown is supported by creating a 'locks' subdirectory in the keyfile directory (ie: /etc/dconf/db/local.d/locks). The files contained in this directory contain a list of keys to lock, one per line. Just as with the keyfiles, you may add any number of files to this directory. Here's an example of what one might look like:\n\n# prevent changes to the company wallpaper\n/org/gnome/desktop/background/picture-uri\n\n\nOf course, you need to run the 'dconf update' tool after changing the locks. The tool will notice if the timestamp on the 'locks' directory has changed, so there is no need to touch the \".d\" directory as well.\nPresently (as of dconf 0.7.4) lockdown is only supported on a per-key basis.

I don’t need to actually shrink the MBR partition, just the logical volume that contains the root “/” filesystem. It’s ~200GB now, and I need to shrink it to ~150GB to make room for a new logical volume. How do I go about this?\n\nA: Any partition and LV resizing should be done on unmounted partitions, so you have to boot from Ubuntu installation disk or USB stick, run it as live CD, connect to Internet, install lvm2\nsudo apt-get install lvm2\n\n...or you can use any Linux rescue CD which already has lvm2 available. Then make sure, that your root LV is not installed, by \nmount \n\nand unmount it when necessary, then do filesystem check\ne2fsck -f /dev/yourVG/yourLV \n\non this LV.

This all worked for me, but it might not work for you. If it blows up for some reason, you don’t want to lose anything that you can’t recover. Continuing on…\nIt is not possible (to my knowledge) to shrink a filesystem while it is mounted, so we need to do the actual resizing from a Live CD. All the following instructions assume you have booted off of the 11.10 Desktop Install CD.\nAfter the Live CD boots up to the desktop, open up the Terminal.\nThe LVM tool are not built-in to the Live CD, so first we must install them:\nsudo apt-get install lvm2\n\nFind the name of the Volume Group (henceforth “somevg”) that contains the root Logical Volume:\nsudo lvs\n\n(If it’s not showing up, try running sudo lvmdiskscan and sudo pvscan then try again.)\nIf you run ls /dev/mapper/ you may see that the Logical Volumes is not showing up. If it’s not there, you need to run the following command to make the kernel aware of the logical volumes:\nsudo vgchange --available y <somevg>\n\nSince we haven’t mounted the root filesystem, it should be safe to resize. Proceed to perform the actual resizing of the Logical Volume. Note that this command (--size -50G) shrinks the volume by 50GB — read the lvreduce(8) man page to learn how to specify a different size.\nsudo lvreduce --resizefs --size -50G /dev/<somevg>/root\n\n(My Logical Volume is called “root”, but yours may be named something different.)\nThis command will first shrink the filesystem, then shrink the Logical Volume that contains it, which is the only safe way to do it.\nYou can now restart the system and boot into your now-resized root filesystem.\n\nA: Have a look into this http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=1537569\n", "Q: How can I find out what version of an application will be in 12.04?

One large advantage for Apple and their developers, is that they get to pick the hardware they want to support. Ubuntu, and Linux in general, needs a great deal of extra complexity due to the need to deal with so many variations of hardware combinations.\nIt seems to me that Linux in general could gain a great deal from a company such a Canonical building or certifying their own computers. Ubuntu would still be supported on \"everything\", but certain hardware would just be a lot better tested.\nCanonical also seems to be in a position where they could do this, as well as earn both extra money and users on it.\nI know that there's a android version of Ubuntu coming up, which is somewhat similar in thought, hence my question is directed at laptops.\nHas there been, or are there, any such plans. Why (not)?\n\nA: One of Ubuntu's greatest strengths is the amount of hardware it runs on out of the box (that is to say that you don't have to install drivers, or special software to use it).\nSo, simply no I don't see them ever \"controlling their hardware\", as Apple does.\nThere are some other third party companies that specialize in building computers specifically for Linux, however these systems tend to be expensive, and often have the same hardware that you could put in any other system.\nOf course I am not associated with Canonical, and so this is just my opinion. \n", "Q: I was tricked into copy pasting a command, did it hurt me?

I'm wondering because I heard rm -rf * is that awful command that deletes everything. \nEdit: Just so any one who reads this is aware, I was told to input this to see an ASCII art animation in terminal. Be warned that this is the trick that was used to fool me.\n\nA: In the spirit of \"it is better to teach a man to fish than give him a fish\", I advise you to type in the terminal man xxd (and yes, I'm yet another person telling you to input something into the terminal... but you should recognize the man command as safe).  \nIf you're not familiar with echo, you should check that out too.  Basically, the command you listed \"echoes\" the string to standard output.\nThe pipe | however channels that standard output into the standard input of the xxd command, which in this case is set to convert a string in hex to regular formatted input.\nSo the short answer is: no, it didn't delete anything.  But it echoed rm -rf * to your screen, which must have given you a bit of a chill :-)\n\nA: The attacker probably meant to have you paste $(echo 726d202d7266202a | xxd -r -p) into your shell.  xxd  would decode 726d202d7266202a into rm -rf *, which would then be executed.\n\nA: Nope, it didn’t do anything — it’s just a close call.\nThe parenthesis tell bash (the shell) to execute the contents in a subshell (which is kind of pointless). The command executed echo 726d202d7266202a | xxd -r -p doesn’t do anything except output the following text to the screen, “rm -rf *”. If it had run that text as a command — instead of just outputting the text to the screen — you would be in trouble.

I'll just suggest that you might try to blow some of the dust out of your system with compressed air. After I do that on my computer the fans seem to run better (louder anyway) and the system runs cooler.\nI recognize that this doesn't explain the difference between Ubuntu and Windows.\nThere are also acpi kernel settings that may be worth trying. See:\n\n\n*\n\n*https://help.ubuntu.com/community/BootOptions\nYou could try this out booting from an Ubuntu CD. (acpi=off, for example). See: \n\n\n*\n\n*http://www.linuxtopia.org/online_books/linux_kernel/kernel_configuration/re71.html\n\nA: if you have a laptop of any kind that is more than two years old, then it is worth taking the fan out and cleaning the radiator grill of fluff and dust.  You will usually find a huge carpet in there!  I am using a laptop that runs hot at the moment so I am supporting the front of it on an old laptop battery.  This lifts the base away from the table and allows a better level of air flow.\nFinally, if you are feeling technical and can take the risk, watch some youtube videos, get some thermal paste and clean and reapply the heat sink on the processor and gpu.  This makes a real difference.\n\nA: I have a pavillion DV7 6000 series. Intel Quad chip, win 7, about 2 yrs old.  At first it ran very cool and quite.  Overtime it got louder and hotter.  Then I started getting warnings at boot up that the fan was not working correctly.  Still it was working, loudly.  \nFinally I dis-assembled the machine.  HP has a great online repair manual that can be downloaded.  It gives detailed instructions for dis-assembly and repair.  The only tools you need are a small Phillips and a toothpick. Inside everything was dusty, especially the fan area.  I cleaned it all out with compressed air, pressure at 40 psi. It works like new.  They warning no longer comes up.\nLastly, I have to say HP built a beautiful machine.  All the parts are accessible with few tools and little expertise.  They supply complete instructions with excellent pictures.  This is one of the best pieces of merchandise I have found in the past 15 years.\n", "Q: How to sync Contacts in 12.04 with Thunderbird / Ubuntu One? \nPossible Duplicate:\nThunderbird Contacts sync with Ubuntu One \n\nHow to get Google Contacts to sync with Thunderbird / Ubuntu One in Ubuntu 12.04 Beta?\nI want to sync Google Contacts with Thunderbird, ultimately to allow using the Unity Contacts lens from the Ataraeo PPA: https://launchpad.net/~atareao/+archive/lenses\nNote: This question is not a duplicate of previous questions:\n\"Import Gmail contacts into Thunderbird via Ubuntu One?\" or \"Thunderbird Contacts sync with Ubuntu One\" or \"How to sync Ubuntu One Contacts with thunderbird?\".

I'm still fairly new to Linux and I was wondering if the Ubuntu boot loader can be configured to boot natively to a virtual machine similar to Windows7/Server 2008 \"vhd with native boot\" feature?\nI've tried running a virtual machine using virtualbox but it's very slow on my system.  I've also tried using vmware play which is much faster, but still the response time isn't the greatest.  Also, I'd rather leave a dual boot as a last resort.\n\nA: It is not the bootloader to look for. We will of course need to load our Ubuntu OS before we can start and run any virtualization software.\nWe may probably define a custom session where we replace the desktop by a virtual machine. Just replace the commands that are responsible to run the desktop manager with commands to run your virtual machine after login.

Use the advanced method I have outlined as a workaround. If you are choosing to do a side-by-side, you can't, as you don't have another OS, and it would be pointless. If you are using the advanced partition option, delete your existing(formatted) partition, select the free space , click add after selecting it, and make an Ext4 filesystem.

Whenever I try to boot into it on 12.04 beta, it gives me a black screen and does not load. Is there a way to see what is going on that it doesn't want to load? I really want to give classic a try.\n\nA: Compiz with gnome classic on 12.04 is extremely buggy. For starters it takes a very long time to load (it shows a black screen for nearly a minute.) Perhaps you just needed to wait a bit longer?\nIn any case, once it does load there are lots more bugs, graphical and otherwise. All of these bugs are caused by compiz 0.9.x. The only sensible way to use gnome-panel with compiz is to downgrade compiz to 0.8.x, though this will mean you cannot use Unity on the same machine.\nIt's also possible to enable metacity compositing in Gnome Classic (no effects) by using gconf-editor to set \"/apps/metacity/general/compositing_manager\" and \"/apps/metacity/general/compositor_effects\" to True. However, this does not give you everything that you get from compiz.\n", "Q: What is the default calendar program?

It sounds like you might have skipped a step in using easybcd to point the bootloader to the right place where Ubuntu is.\n\nFirst, here is some reading you should skim over:\n1. Here is a solution regarding the alert you got. Read that first. \n2. Here is a video that shows a walkthrough for using EasyBCD. \n3. Here is a detailed guide to adding ubuntu to the windows bootloader and setting the two up using EasyBCD. And it has nice screenshots with explanations. \n4. Here is yet another guide for using EasyBCD.\nSo what you are doing with EasyBCD is adding Ubuntu to the Windows Bootloader. The GRUB2 bootloader is going to be installed on your external hard drive, so what you want to do is point the Windows Bootloader to boot GRUB2, which should point to the partition that is your external. Then, the windows bootloader will pass you off to GRUB, from where you should be able to select ubuntu. It might help to check out the GRUB2 tutorial reference to get an idea of how GRUB works.\nIf you boot to live CD you can run sudo blkid. Do the IDs of the bootable drive match the one in the error, if so you can use this video and reinstate grub from the liveCD.\n\nA: You have to repair Ubuntu booting (reinstall GRUB2) - this will find Windows installation and create a grub2 based boot menu where you can choose which OS to load - Ubuntu or Windows.\nEasyBcd is using its own boot loader for booting Grub2 based OS and so is introducing another level of errors. \nWindows boot manager and GRUB2 manager are enough for booting both systems - no need for third party boot loaders.\n", "Q: How to view/mount other partitions on your hard drive Recently I have installed Ubuntu 12.04 Beta 2 on a USB flash drive and decided to install it on an old external HDD which I have taken out of the casing and succesfully mounted in my desktop computer. There is no other operating system besides the newly install Ubuntu. However, there is about 500gb of data on the drive. This is why i used a partitioning software on my windows 7 netbook to partition the hard drive to set aside 1tb for files, 350gb of space for linux and the remaining 650gb for Vista which i plan on installing soon.\nBut this is where the problem sets in...when installing Ubuntu it does not recognize that the drive is partitioned at all, it's just one big open block of space...so I used the installers built in partitioning feature to set aside 300gb for main Ubuntu install and 50gb for swap space. I set both of these partitions to be created at the \"end\" so that it wouldn't delete or write over my data.\nAnd this is where i am really lost; when booting into Ubuntu i am able to use it perfectly fine, got on internet, etc...but i have NO CLUE as to how i can view files that were previously on the drive (all of my data that i had prior to install). \nHow can I mount/be able to view the other partition so that i can have access to my data?\nThank you ahead of time! I REALLY appreciate any help or advice!\n~Preston\n\nA: I'm sorry to tell you this, but your files are likely to be gone.\nAny partitioning/formatting/installing operation is potentially dangerous and it is important to have a backup of your important data before doing anything. Especially if you have no experience with partitioning or clear understanding of what is going on. Especially when the partitioning tools see the drive as \"one big open block of space\".\nThe problem was likely caused by Windows converting the disk to so-called \"dynamic disk\" - see this for some details: http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=1705481\nIf the files were important, you can try to recover them - the data (at least some of it) is likely still on the disk. The first thing to do in this case would be to stop all use of the disk immediately. \nI'm not too familiar with recovery tools, but basically the procedure would involve creating a snapshot of the disk (which is a bit problematic with a 2Tb drive as you'll need a bigger drive to store the snapshot) and then using some program which would try to find the partition. This answer explains how to use TestDisk program and provides helpful links.\nRegarding partitioning - now, when your disk is not a \"dynamic volume\" anymore, you can use GParted to add some partitions in the free space. Installing Windows after you intalled Ubuntu will override the bootloader so you won't be able to boot into Ubuntu, but it's reasonably easy to fix with Ubuntu LiveCD\n", "Q: Wiped Ubuntu files, bootloader still there, how can I remove it and restore Windows? \nPossible Duplicate:\nHow to remove Ubuntu and put Windows back on? \n\nI had Ubuntu installed through the Windows 7 dual boot option.

All other connection speeds are normal, average download speed is about 2mbps but my updates are lucky to get to 100kbps. Updates and this website are the only things running any ideas what the problem could be?\n\nA: It might be your local mirror being slow from the 12.04 attention. You might want to switch mirrors temporarily:\n\n\n*\n\n*How can I get apt to use a mirror close to me, or choose a faster mirror?\n\n*How do I change which mirror I get updates and software from?\n\nA: Been using ubuntu a long time now and can tell you its the mirror. Back in the day the canadian mirrors were so slow it was almost impossible to install (with download updates while installing option). So most of us just got in the habit of selecting \"New York\" as our time zone during install so that it would default to us.archive.... (the american faster mirror at the time which is in same time zone so no harm no foul). Now days though I have noticed the same problems you are describing. During a week day you will be lucky to get 100K/s. On the weekend around 3am it seems to get up around 800K/s (as fast as my modem goes so might be faster for others). So what I did to test is open up the sources and change the country code from \"us.archive....\" to \"ca.archive....\". The first thing it did was educate me that the canadian mirrors have been upgraded and fly pretty good now (during the afore mentioned weekend time). Alas it still suffers during the week days, though in my experience is still faster then the US servers (around 100-200 K/s). Just keep changing the mirror until you find one that works. I havn't tested any but \"us\" and \"ca\" so I cannot offer any insight there.\nEdit sources file: sudo gedit /etc/apt/sources.list\n\nA: Apart from what Jorge suggested (about choosing best servers), you can actually remove some extra third-party repositories (like launchpad ones which you might have installed for some extra themes etc) to make the process a LOT faster. \nYou can read about it here: How to remove a repository?\nLet's say you want to download and install some extra plugin - say Gmail video chat one. Having just that repository selected in this list, before you do a\nsudo apt-get update\n\nwill make it drastically fast because you don't have to download all other unnecessary lists. \nThis list file is kinda big one (about 24 MB minimum -for default packages - and removing unwanted repositories will save you say one minute or something.). You can read about this more here: the size of apt-get update lists is too big\nAt the same place (where you select these repositories), you can \"Select best server\" to make download as fast as possible. Sometimes, when mirrors near you go down, this will automatically select the best server at that time. You can read the second answer here: How can I get apt to use a mirror close to me, or choose a faster mirror?\nAll those settings are under \"Update Manager\", so take a look at it, and happy tweaking!\n\nA: I just read that apt-fast is able to make the download faster than apt-get using multiple connections by using aria2 as the default download manager. \nHere is the link to the article.\n", "Q: What would cause SSD to become not detectable?

In fact, the proprietary nVidia drivers do not support Optimus systems at all, and the ‘Additional Drivers’ dialog should not offer to install them for you.\nIf your IdeaPad has an option in the BIOS to switch between the integrated and discrete GPUs then the nVidia drivers should work if that switch is set to discrete-only.\nIf you don't have a BIOS switch like that, then the nvidia drivers won't work, and trying to install them will make you unhappy.\nThe easiest way to recover would be to remove the configuration file telling X to load the nvidia driver; it will then autodetect what driver should be loaded, and load the Intel driver.\nTo do that, you want to run sudo rm /etc/X11/xorg.conf in a terminal.\nIf you've installed the nvidia drivers they will have broken the 3D component of the Intel drivers.

If you use nslookup for the custom DNS name you are trying to reach you'll need to see the nameserver that you are querying. If the address is different you are trying to resolve the name on a server where it is not listed. \nfor example...\nmunich:~ jeremy$ nslookup bangkok\nServer:     192.168.1.2\nAddress:    192.168.1.2#53\n\nName:   bangkok.home.com\nAddress: 192.168.1.5\n\nBangkok is a custom DNS name for a box in my home network. Were I to connect to my companies VPN I would hit their nameserver first so I can revolve their custom names such as svn and wiki. We have several namesevers at work, each with their own domain like foo.work.com and bar.work.com and work.com. If I have bar.work.com listed as my first domain and I try to reach svn.foo.work.com with only svn the search will fail to resolve to an ip address because it will look for svn.bar.work.com. \n", "Q: How to install a new D-Link NIC in Ubuntu 11.04 Server?

I have installed Vuze on Ubuntu 11.04.Everything is working fine.But when I close Vuze and try to reopen it, it won't open. If I restart the system and try opening Vuze it would open normally. So can someone tell me what is the problem here and how to solve this?\n\nA: If you close it the process will keep running up & (seeding & downloading) you can kill the process \npidof Java\nkill <pid number>\n\nor you can use \"system monitor\" \n\nthis picture shows you that \"Java\" is running App name \"Azureus\" (\"Vuze\" is an app made by \"Azureus\")\nafter killing the process the you can open \"Vuze\" again\n(Sorry I was not a member in the time that you asked this question)\nor you can make a \"Bash\" script (just like i did)\ncheck if the \"Java\" process is running close it open the \"Vuze\" else open the \"Vuze\" directly (Pid variable) then make a luncher to this script Using \"gnome-desktop-item-edit\" in the command type if it is a shell script \"sh filename.sh\" or elseif python \"python filname.py\"\nYou can help the \"Azureus\" by sharing this info that the app is not closing correctly (reporting the bug) \n\nA: Mostly it's a bug!

It should open normally and it even won't display the message at the bottom right corner that says that \"vuze wasn't shut down correctly\". I hope this helps\n\nA: Actually this is the problem in the design of vuze.\nIf you close vuze it is never actually closed. It runs in background with a process name java.\nTo see that you open the system monitor and see the running processes then you will see the java process corresponding to the vuze.\nTo deal with this problem you have to change the setting of the vuze to stop running in background once closed.\nGo to tools->options->interface then uncheck the close minimizes to system tray...\n\nA: I got a work around... Just open a .vuze file and it shows up. Looks like its been running the entire time... I'm new to Ubuntu so I don't know the terminal commands all that well. Hope this works for you.\n\nA: Vuze tries to minimize itself to the 'system tray' when closed. With Vuze this no longer works since Ubuntu 11.04 and persists until 14.04.\nTo prevent this behaviour, in Options -> Interface deselect the \"Close minimizes to system tray\" option to prevent Vuze to stay open in the background.\n", "Q: GtkIconView doesn't automatically fill the space with icon when user resizes the window In the Ubuntu Accomplishments project we are having a few unusual bugs:\n\n\n*\n\n*https://bugs.launchpad.net/bugs/986708\n\n*https://bugs.launchpad.net/bugs/974728\nNamely that we have a window with a GtkNotebook and a GtkIconView on a page and another on another page.\nWhen the user re-sizes the window the iconview does not automatically fill the space with icons (they stay in their original column layout) but if the user changes the GtkNotebook pages and thus refreshes the icon view the space is taken up as expected. How can we automatically use the space when resizing the window?\nWhat is more concerning though is that when the window appears, we can resize it smaller - it seems as if the iconview is blocking us from resizing and then having a scrollable region for the icons.\nThe code looks like this. The ListStores that drive the IconViews:\n    self.trophystore = Gtk.ListStore(str, GdkPixbuf.Pixbuf, bool, bool, str, str) # title, icon accomplished, locked, app, accomplishment\n    self.trophystore.set_sort_column_id(COL_TITLE, Gtk.SortType.ASCENDING)\n    self.trophy_icon.set_model(self.trophystore)\n\n    self.oppstore = Gtk.ListStore(str, GdkPixbuf.Pixbuf, bool, bool, str, str) # title, icon, accomplished, locked, app, accomplishment\n    self.oppstore.set_sort_column_id(COL_TITLE, Gtk.SortType.ASCENDING)\n    self.opp_icon.set_model(self.oppstore)\n\n    self.trophy_icon.set_text_column(COL_TITLE)\n    self.trophy_icon.set_pixbuf_column(COL_PIXBUF)\n\n    self.opp_icon.set_text_column(COL_TITLE)\n    self.opp_icon.set_pixbuf_column(COL_PIXBUF)\n\nOther than this, we don't really poke around with the IconViews, we just add content to the ListStores to update the views.\nThe code for the project is here - can anyone recommend how we can fix these two issues?\n\nA: Okay, as we have figure out how to fix this, I'll describe the solution here, in case anyone else has this problem.\nThe trick is to place the GtkIconView in a GtkScrolledWindow, and set it's hscrollbar_policy to \"always\". Then, a check-resize signal has to be used, to react when the user resizes the window (note that it must be checked if the size has changed, for the signal is emitted also when e.g. the window is dragged around). \nWhen the size changes, the model used by GtkIconView has to be cleared and recreated, as this triggers GtkIconView properly reallocating the newly gained space (or shrinking). Also, as the result the horizontal scrollbar will never be seen, as the GtkIconView uses exactly that much space as the GtkScrolledWindow uses.\n\nA: My preferred solution to this problem is a very small subclass of Gtk.IconView:\nclass FluidIconView (Gtk.IconView):\n    def __init__ (self):\n        Gtk.IconView.__init__ (self)\n        self.connect (\"size-allocate\", FluidIconView.on_size_allocate)\n\n    def do_get_preferred_width (self):\n        return (0,0)\n\n    def on_size_allocate (self, allocation):\n        [self.set_columns (m) for m in [1,self.get_columns ()]]\n\nThe get_preferred_width override allows the view to be arbitrarily narrow.  The size-allocate callback forces a relayout by setting the number of columns to 1 and back.\n\nA: You can also set the columns to 0 and back to -1 when the size changes. This way the icons won't be deselected:\niconview.set_columns(0)\niconview.set_columns(-1)\n\n(This should be done in addition to @rafalcieslak's answer.)\n", "Q: How does one go about satisfying dependencies for a package in a ppa that rely on packages with binary components? Simplest explanation of the question is, you can't put any binary components on ppa.  \nHow does one go about satisfying dependencies for a package they could put on ppa if they could satisfy dependencies(and possibly how would you satisfy those)?  \nIt's kind of similar to this except that I can't put the dependencies in the PPA since they rely on some binary components.  \n\nA: I think binary blobs are disallowed by design. The idea, I've always assumed, is that anyone adding your ppa to their system should be able to look at everything that has gone into its packages--to make sure jts packages are safe to run. Since PPA's were designed for open source packages only, that's probably not unreasonable.\nOf course you can build such sets of packages on your own machine and host the deb's elsewhere, but I realize that's not really what you want.\n", "Q: Is open source software vulnerable to viruses? I understand the ideas behind open source software, but I am more interested in the security aspects. How is open source software not exposed to viruses or any kind of Internet attack? How does it stay secure over time? I have heard that open source software is prone to attacks, but the chances are less than Windows-based software. I am unclear about this.\nAnd why do some Linux users not use an antivirus?\n\nA: It's not that they couldn't exist.  It's that by and large they don't.  \nThe security model being a little more complicated on most open source systems and the peer review of code by other developers both lead to this.  \nHere's an example:\nFor closed source applications -\nYou're developing an application, and you use some windows library.  It crashes when you pass it an incorrect parameter.  You tweak your application to pass the parameter properly so it works and move on.  \nSame scenario for open source applications -\nYou're developing an application, and you use some linux library.  It crashes when you pass an incorrect parameter.  If you think the way you passed it is sane, you see why it crashed and submit a bug-report to the library package with a patch to make it work as anticipated.  If you think the way you passed it was wrong, you see why it crashed and submit a bug-report to the library package with a patch to make sanitize that input.  \nSee the difference in the outcome on the two scenarios?  \nAnd why not an antivirus?\nThe best answers I can come up with on why not antivirus are this, this, and this.  Anti-virus has a place, but it's not a solution.\n\nA: Firstly, I'd like to clarify that not all FOSS software are Virus Proof\nThe amount of viruses and bugs in a program depends on the developer and the community\nBut, FOSS software have a better resistance to viruses in the following way\nLet me give you an example\nClosed source:\n\n\n*\n\n*X closed source software has Y company maintaining it\n\n*X software gets a virus/bug\n\n*Y company now has to have its employees to look into the issue because the community does not have the source code, which usually takes some time\n\n*Bugfix by Y company\nOpen Source\n\n\n*\n\n*X open source software has Z community maitaining it, alongwith Y Developer/Company\n\n*X software gets a virus/bug\n\n*Y company/developer tries to work it out alongwith Z community \n\n*Bugs get fixed faster\nSo, the security of FOSS software depends on the strength and willingness of the community to help in development and maintaining\n\nA: In addition to what everyone else has said, what it comes down to is this:\n\nGiven a large enough beta-tester and co-developer base, almost every problem will be characterized quickly and the fix will be obvious to someone.\n\nIn plain English:\n\ngiven enough eyeballs, all bugs are shallow\n\nVia wikipedia\nAs such, since all security issues are bugs, this applies.\nIn addition, antivirus is a last-minute defense: If the virus/security flaw got to your system, something else is dangerously wrong. With open source, you have more flexibility with finding out who, what, where, when, why and how it got to that point.\n\nA: Open source is not inherently safer. It might be a little bit, due to the following reasons:\n\n\n*\n\n*Potentially more people look at the code, so bugs allowing for security vulnerabilities are more easily spotted. (Also, it's not true that open source means attackers can just slip in hacks, as some people might be led to think - code is still checked before included in any project. Unless of course the project itself is malicious.)\n\n*An openly governed project creates an ethos of contributing back, e.g. when a security flaw is found, this is reported (and subsequently fixed), rather than exploited).\n\n*The creators of an open source project often have no incentive to deny that vulnerabilities exist until a fix is found -- the more people know about it, the more likely it is someone will know how to fix this.\n\n\nThis will only marginally make it safer, though, since bugs will still exist and people will be using their powers for Bad rather than Good.\nWhen it comes to Ubuntu and all other Linux distributions, though, fact is that it has been designed from the ground up from a multi-user perspective, with one user being able to make modifications to the system and the rest only being allowed to change what's relevant to them - in Windows this was rather tacked on later on (though probably works pretty well by now (Windows 7)). \nStill, one could easily write a virus that removes all of a user's personal files. The biggest reason for there being no virus for Ubuntu, is simply that it has a really, really small market share. Thus, there is little to gain and little incentive for a hacker to go through the extra trouble of supporting Ubuntu when they could just target Windows and gain a lot. That, and users of Linux are often more well-versed technically, so would be less likely to install something of which they do not know what it does (though then again, the absence of viruses may lead them to trust everything they download).\n(Then again, Ubuntu's update model, among others, is much better than Windows's, meaning that fixed for vulnerabilities can be distributed far quicker.)\n\nA: If you are asking about the code being hijacked or malicious executables being added, the only method to remain truly safe(in paranoia) is to manually check the source code and compile it yourself in case the downloadable version has other malicious code. \n", "Q: How can i disable the update prompt?

In the Updates tab of the resulting window, there are a number of options that control the behaviour of the update manager.\nWhat is annoying you is that the When there are security updates: setting is set to Display Immediately.  If you would like the protection of these security updates without being bothered, consider setting this to Download and install automatically instead.\nWith this change, the update manager will pop up at most once a week for the non-security updates.  You can switch this to fortnightly by changing When there are other updates: to Display every two weeks.\nThere is also an option to turn off checking for updates entirely in this tab, but I would recommend against picking it since it can leave your system vulnerable to preventable problems.\n\nA: I also find this annoying as I use the command line to update my system on my netbook.

I get ~5 hours on Windows compared to <2 hours on Ubuntu. What can I do to decrease power consumption?\n\nA: On a hybrid Intel/AMD system, blacklisting radeon won't actually turn off the discrete Radeon card; it'll be in a lowish-power state because it's not doing anything, but it won't be off.\nIn order to actually turn off the card you need to have both intel and radeon loaded so that the vgaswitcheroo infrastructure gets initialised, and then you can run\necho OFF | sudo tee /sys/kernel/debug/vgaswitcheroo/switch\n\nwhich will turn off any GPUs that vgaswitcheroo thinks are unused; in this case, it'll be your Radeon.  You'll need to do this each boot; it's not persistent across restarts.\n\nA: To make it \"persistent\", set an rc.local line(s) to arrange it every startup. (It's not actually persistent, but it will seem like it is to the user).\nThis site gives some hints: \nhttps://help.ubuntu.com/community/HybridGraphics\nTo have permanent write permissions to the switch file, add the following line, replacing USERNAME with your username, to /etc/init.d/rc.local:\nchown USERNAME /sys/kernel/debug/vgaswitcheroo/switch\nNow, whichever card you want to be in use and on/off, just add another line that follows the convention for vgaswitcheroo, as seen on that page.\necho ON > /sys/kernel/debug/vgaswitcheroo/switch\nTurns on the GPU that is disconnected (not currently driving outputs), but does not switch outputs.\necho IGD > /sys/kernel/debug/vgaswitcheroo/switch\nConnects integrated graphics with outputs.\necho DIS > /sys/kernel/debug/vgaswitcheroo/switch\nConnects discrete graphics with outputs.\necho OFF > /sys/kernel/debug/vgaswitcheroo/switch\nTurns off the graphics card that is currently disconnected.\nThere are also a couple of options that are useful from inside an X-Windows session:\necho DIGD > /sys/kernel/debug/vgaswitcheroo/switch\nQueues a switch to integrated graphics to occur when the X server is next restarted.\necho DDIS > /sys/kernel/debug/vgaswitcheroo/switch\nQueues a switch to discrete graphics to occur when the X server is next restarted.\ncat /sys/kernel/debug/vgaswitcheroo/switch\nAllows you to verify the current state of the hybrid graphics.

I couldn't find a button or option in the program that was related to updates. :(\nis there no alternative to uninstalling the whole thing and installing the newer version?\n\nA: The easiest way to update a single package is to look for a PPA (Personal Package Archive). These are hosted on launchpad and it allows users to package and distribute newer versions of packages. See these instructions for adding a PPA.\nHere is a PPA for LibreOffice with 3.5.x for 11.10. Although to be sure to read the notes on the PPA page that says that the packages are for testing.

All You need is described in the README files in downloaded packages. It integrates with Ubuntu very well, and automatically :]\n\nA: An alternative to reinstalling the entire program would be to upgrade to 12.04, and have the LibreOffice Calc package automatically updated to 3.5.2, which already appears in the Precise repos. This is better than reinstalling LibreOffice if you plan on updating to 12.04 already. \n\nA: If you did install the current version manually, you don't need to uninstall it before installing the new version (manually, too).

This does not include music that is in folders that have been shared with you. It's possible your music is appearing under \"Unknown Artist\", if we've had problems reading the metadata from it.

And analyze the page images with PIL to find bounding boxes, using the threshold 191. \ninstall using\n\npip install pdfCropMargins\n\nRun using\n\npdf-crop-margins -v -s -u your-file.pdf\n\nFor help\n\npdf-crop-margins -h | more\n\n\nA: Thanks for Rasmus, you can install pdfcrop from texlive-extra-utils package:\nsudo apt-get install texlive-extra-utils\n\nThen crop pdf files using pdf crop command as:\npdfcrop input.pdf output.pdf\n\nuse --help to see more amazing parameters like --margins\npdfcrop --margins 5 input.pdf output.pdf\n\nwhich crop pdf with 5 bp from each side of page\n\nA: This may help you.\nThis is in accordance with the newer version of Ubuntu and life.\nThis is Master PDF Editor. You can use it crop, add some stuff, etc.\nExample:\nThis is before\n\nThis is after ctrl + k\n\n\nA: You can also crop PDF files simply using Ghostscript. I have written a small script to simplify the process (inspired by this answer):\n#!/bin/bash\n\nif [ $# -lt 5 ]\nthen\n  echo \"Usage: `basename $0` <pdf-file> <x_min> <x_max> <y_min> <y_max>\"\n  echo \"Notes:\"\n  echo \" - all coordinates are absolute; no calculation of width/height necessary\"\n  echo \" - use 'gv' to determine the coordinates\"\n  exit 65\nfi\n\nfile=\"$1\"\nxmin=\"$2\"\nxmax=\"$3\"\nymin=\"$4\"\nymax=\"$5\"\n\nbase=\"${file%.*}\"\noutfile=\"${base}_cropped.pdf\"\n\necho \"writing to: $outfile\"\n\ngs \\\n  -o $outfile \\\n  -sDEVICE=pdfwrite \\\n  -c \"[/CropBox [$xmin $ymin $xmax $ymax] /PAGES pdfmark\" \\\n  -f $file\n\nIn order to determine the coordinates for cropping, I use gv, which prints the coordinates of the mouse cursor using the same units as Ghostscript. For example, here I determine the minimum coordinates for x/y (the values in the upper left corner):\n\nNow the maximum coordinates:\n\nAnd finally, I run the script pdf_crop_by_coordinates.sh test.pdf 45 429 38 419 producing a test_cropped.pdf which looks like that:\n\nI have no idea though, how the Ghostscript solution compares to pdfcrop in terms of quality and correctness.\n\nA: When I can't do something with pdftk, the next place I turn is PDFjam, which is a command-line wrapper for the pdfpages LaTeX package (hence you also need that and a TeX distro installed). For help on how to use it, I recommend the regular help screen:\npdfjam --help\n\nas the man page is sparse and the Web page concentrates on examples.\nTo crop a PDF, the command you need is something like this:\npdfjam --keepinfo --trim \"10mm 15mm 10mm 15mm\" --clip true --suffix \"cropped\" input.pdf\n\nThis will output a file called input-cropped.pdf. The order of the trims should be left, bottom, right, top, as per \\includegraphics from graphicx.\nTo give an idea of how it compares with PDFcrop, I had cause to crop a quite fancy PDF recently. My original was 675 kB, my cropped version via PDFjam was 1.2 MB, while a version cropped via PDFcrop was 4.5 MB. While both PDFjam and PDFcrop stripped out the embedded hyperlinks and bookmarks, PDFjam with the --keepinfo option preserved the document properties (e.g. title, author, subject).\n\nA: You could use a pypdf script from this page. But in the answer to this stackexchange question, there seem to be many options as well.\n\nA: I would suggest you take a look at PDFcrop.\nIf you wish to crop a pdf with left, top, right and bottom margins of 5, 10, 20, and 30 pt (points), then run\npdfcrop --margins '5 10 20 30' input.pdf output.pdf\n\nin terminal. To actually crop something away, use negative values in the argument for crop. For example,\npdfcrop --margins '-50 -50 -50 -50' input.pdf output.pdf\n\ncrops 50 pts from the left, top, right, bottom (in this order).\nIf you run only the command pdfcrop input, it will output a file titled input-crop.pdf with zero margins. I find this very handy when including pdf illustrations in documents.\nCropping multiple files\nUnfortunately, pdfcrop cannot crop multiple files at the time. It is however easy to write a script that will crop all pdfs in the folder the script is located in.\nCreate a new empty file, and call it something.sh. Open it with a text editor and insert the following:\n#!/bin/bash\nfor FILE in ./*.pdf; do\n  pdfcrop \"${FILE}\"\ndone\n\nSave it, and close. Then right click the file, go to Properties > Permissions and check the field Allow executing file as program. Now close the dialog. Run the script by double clicking it and choosing Run in Terminal. And new, zero-margin cropped version of all pdfs with suffix -crop will now be printed in the folder. If you want margins or other things, you can of course just open the script and add arguments after pdfcrop.\n\nA: Using pdfjam you can set any option which comes from the package pdfpages  originally, and so you can set --fitpaper true, it should adapt the the paper size to fit to the (first) input file.\nI had a case to combine multiple JPG into a PDF and adding metadata as well and trim it to incoming jpg size. This will work for equal sizes of input JPGs to be cropped well and have no white margins:\n# equal sizes of input images\npdfjam  Image_00001.jpg Image_00002.jpg Image_00003.jpg Image_00004.jpg Image_00005.jpg \\\n  --pdftitle   'My custom title' \\\n  --pdfsubject 'My custom subject' \\\n  --pdfkeywords 'keyword1; keyword2; keyword3; aso;' \\\n  --pdfauthor 'author1; author2;' \\\n  --fitpaper true --outfile 'Images_Combined.pdf'\n\npdfinfo 'Images_Combined.pdf' # testing results for meta data\n# Title:           My custom title\n# Subject:         My custom subject\n# Keywords:        keyword1; keyword2; keyword3; aso;\n# Author:          author1; author2;\n# Creator:         LaTeX with hyperref\n# Producer:        pdfTeX-1.40.22\n# CreationDate:    Sun May  1 15:03:01 2022 CEST\n# ModDate:         Sun May  1 15:03:01 2022 CEST\n# …\n\nNote: If you have different sizes of input JPG, it will fit the paper size to the first one and scale all remaining pages to be merged to the size of that first one, so some pages will have no white margins and some will have.\nEdit: this was done from TeX Live 2021 with pdfjam --version 3.03 and package pdfpages from 2021/03/06\n", "Q: Why does gnome-terminal freeze when an SSH session gets disconnected? This is a very simple problem. I use gnome-terminal to SSH to other machines every day. I do this on a laptop which I carry around the office, so I am constantly switching between wired and wireless networks. When this happens my SSH sessions drops off and the terminal freezes.\nWhy does this happen (the freezing, not the session dropping) and is their a way to prevent it? I know I can get around this by logging off from the remote server before I know I want to disconnect my laptop from Ethernet.\nIt's annoying because I have to manually close the terminal session after it has frozen which pops up a dialogue box and I also lose the title of the session - all very time consuming. It would be much better if the ssh session just got killed and it returned me back to the local bash prompt.\n\nA: Without getting into the why of it, here's how you fix it:\n~.\nthat's tilde-dot.  Press those two keys, one after another, and that will disconnect from the hung ssh session and give you back your terminal.

It uses GTK, which itself uses a styling language based on CSS. However, you can use WebKit to provide the functionality you're after. For instance, the following program will give you a WebKit-based AskUbuntu-browser. \nI wrote this in Python, but you can use JavaScript as well if you like.

That will probably leave you with only “exit” or nothing at all. If you leave in “exit” the kiosk user can log out and get to the login screen, but he can only log in again as kiosk unless he can guess the password for admin. If you remove it completely it is possible that you yourself won't be able to log out of kiosk (e.g. in order to log in as admin and do maintenance). On my ubuntu-installation both ctrl-alt-backspace and ctrl-alt-sysrq-k are disabled, so I can only reboot with ctrl-alt-sysrq-b. Alternatively you can log in remotely or use ctrl-alt-f1 and do your maintenance work from the command line.\nEdit file ~/.config/openbox/autostart:\n# run firefox:\nwhile true; do firefox; sleep 5s; done &\n\nWhat the user can do on this setup:\nClose Firefox with alt-f4 (but it restarts after a few seconds).\nUse alt-tab to switch between programs (but Firefox is the only program).\nHe can only follow links from the homepage, so he cannot abuse the internet.\nReboot machine (but password in bios)\nctrl-alt-f1 – but he doesn't know the password to login as admin.\nIf he can log out of openbox and get to lightdm, he can log in again as kiosk and choose another window manager and get full control, so you need to delete all other .desktop entries from /usr/share/xsessions/ except openbox.desktop. I don't know of any way you can tie a user to a particular wm. :-(\nAdvantages of using Openbox instead of just a browser on top of Xwindows:\nChromium/Firefox in kiosk mode is always maximized. When I don’t use a wm, it never fills out the whole screen.\nI get the Exit menu option (optional).\nWhat is it good for?\nA fullscreen kiosk is good for browsing a particular website e.g. a school, a library, or a museum's website. However it is nice to be able to get back to the main/start page in case you get lost, so the website needs to be designed with a big home button and very easy navigation. And you cannot have any links leading users offsite since they cannot get back. Of course the browser will reset after a period of inactivity or if you close it with alt-f4, but most users won’t know that and will become very frustrated. That is why fullscreen mode usually isn't always that userfriendly and that’s why I wanted to keep some toolbar functionality and only Firefox could give me that, not Chrome. Alternatively give Openkiosk a try, it didn’t work for me because of the popup issue, but it might work for you.\n\nA: Firefox Kiosk\nChromium-browser kiosk configurations do not allow for web pages requiring ‘java’.

That worked for me. \n", "Q: Why does Ubuntu force users to create a password upon installation? There's been one problem I've had since I installed Ubuntu to run alongside Windows, I assume this would also be the same if it was installed to replace the other operating system as well, the installer prompts you to create a password upon typing in the user account name and if you don't put in a password and just put in the user account name, it ends up saying to create a password. My comparison is in Windows and Mac OS X, you are never forced to create a password.\nIf you remove the password on your Admin account in System Settings > User Accounts, you won't be able to authenticate whenever you try to install something, because it requests for a password and putting in no password at all isn't going to work, it will just act as if you put in an invalid password. This is what I call \"getting locked out of privileges\".\nI'm finding the \"Authenticate\" window that comes up whenever you install something or accessing somewhere a nuisance, 'cause it always requests for your password.\nSo my question is - Why does Ubuntu force users to create a password upon installation?\n\nA: You're right that OS X doesn't force you to make a password.  But this is actually a flaw.  Or if you want to say it nicely, a \"compromise\" between usability and functionality.  Without a password in OS X, you cannot ever use the sudo command.  Now you say, I never use the Terminal to do stuff, so who cares?  Well, next time you try to install an app that needs certain privileges, you'll find you can't install it and that you have to make a password first.\nIn fact, if you look in the Mac forums, you'll find a variety of issues for people that didn't set a password.  For example, you'll have trouble connecting to Windows shares.  \nBasically scenarios where some form of authentication is needed are all potentially areas where you will run into trouble.  Consider this person who changed their password to blank to make their life \"easier\" and found out that Filevault does not like that! (they got locked out) \nAs for Windows, which I've long been unfamiliar with since Windows 98, despite what you say, a quick Googling suggests having no password (or more precisely, a \"blank\" password) is not quite the normal state of matters.\nSimilar to the situation with OS X, you'll find you need to do some fiddling to get some things to work.  According to Microsoft,\"this behavior is by design... to improve system security\".  \nI'm sure other people will more than adequately explain why Ubuntu requires a password.  My point in my answer is that Apple and Microsoft should require a non-blank password.  You're going to need it for full functionality, and allowing users to set the password to blank is just asking for trouble.\n\nA: Perhaps the real question should be why is it that Windows or Mac OS X (if that's actually the case, never used it) don't require you to have and use passwords. \nYou will probably find once you have set your system set up to your satisfaction that the amount of time you have to enter your password decreases substantially, I've been running the development version for months and still only use the password once or twice a day.\nThe password is there for a reason - so that people accessing your system when you are not aware being unable to damage it.\nIf you find that you are using it a lot in a terminal run \nsudo -i\n\ndo what you need to and then exit.\nRead up on root and sudo - it's there and won't be going anywhere.\nhttps://help.ubuntu.com/community/RootSudo\nAt the end of the day Linux of any sort is not Windows nor Mac.\nhttp://linux.oneandoneis2.org/LNW.htm\n\nA: Every time I've installed OS X, I've been asked to create a password for my account.  Granted, I've never thought of not creating a password.\nThere are ways to dramatically reduce the number of times you are asked for a password. As someone has already mentioned, read up on the sudo command.  You can configure it so it won't ask for a password when you need to do something that requires root privileges.\nYou can also easily configure your system to avoid asking for your password when it boots up.\nYou could also just run as root all the time, but that would be very much a mistake.\nPasswords aren't security perfection.  But, I'd certainly use one, if nothing else to protect my machine from prowling and/or malicious passers-by.\n\nA: Thanks for asking a straight question, the answer is \"Because it's more secure\".\nAny security measure will have at least a small \"annoyance\" factor.\n\"You must know your password to install software in Ubuntu. This is a security feature of Ubuntu, and other Linux distributions.\"\nThis prevents unauthorized people from messing the system's configuration, it's also a \"safety net\" for you to confirm that you actually want to do changes to the configuration.\nIt may be argued that if you know nobody is going to use your computer anyway, then you don't need a password, but the OS has no way of knowing that. Ubuntu is conservative in that respect in asking you to always have a password, unlike other systems that may allow you to \"shoot yourself in the foot\".\nBy the way, I'll take your word for Mac OS's behavior, but really I don't remember it being entirely passwordless; it always asks me for a password when upgrading and sometimes when installing software.\nThe workaround I suggest is for you to set a very short and easy password.\n\nA: Why? Because Ubuntu is a version of Linux, which is a processor-specific version of Unix (which was somewhat based on Multics). Unix was designed from the beginning as a multi-user multi-tasking system, so passwords were used to secure different user accounts on the same machine. This also included system accounts like root which were also passworded to stop unknowledgeable users from causing damage to the system.  \nMS-Windows was based on MS-DOS which, although it copied some ideas from Unix, was intended to be a personal single-user system. Newer single-user versions of MS-Windows, starting with Windows2000 and WindowsXP are based on the multi-user multi-tasking WinNT core and introduced Linux-like access control protection to prevent the system being damaged. Although the newer versions of Apple's Mac operating system are essentially a custom version of Unix (in this case based on NeXTStep, in turned based on BSD Unix), the Mac is also usually a single-user personal computer.  \nSince the development of Linux is open-source and until fairly recently only had a very technically-savvy user base, rules such as \"never run as a user with super-user privileges, and especially not as the root user\", have pretty much been mantras.  However, as the popularity of Ubuntu as a single-user system grows, more and more users who are also their system's administrator, want to run as a super-user to avoid having to retype their passwords frequently, often keeping an elevated-privilege terminal open via sudo -i.  There is a certain logic to this, since you're the same person who's going to enter the command and just as likely to type the same mistake, after you've re-entered your password. Read RootSudo for detailed information, including possible dangers.  \nHowever, there is still a strong consensus among the existing Linux community to only run with the privileges you need at that moment. Plus, if any of your data is personal and you don't want anyone who has access to your machine to look at it, you will at least want a user password and probably not enable auto-logon.\n", "Q: How do I vertically flip my webcam's image?

I know this is the case for the MPC 2000,3000,5000 and there many variants.\nUbuntu will automatically detect the printer but select Postscript, I have to after installing a printer go into the printer settings and manually choose a PXL driver as shown here.\n\n\n*\n\n*choose printers from the dash. \n\n*right click on the printer and go to properties.\n\n*choose change make and model.\n\n*Select NRG -> MPC 2000 PXL\nYou should then be able to print and not waste a tree of paper.\n \n\nA: The easiest thing to do is to manually add the printer by IP if it is networked something you can do is go to device and printers go to the actual printer right click go to printer properties and select the port table scroll down to the following IP which should be check copy it down go back to devices and printers add printer create a new port select standard TCP/IP enter the IP address which has been recorded next next and replace the current driver print a test page.\n\nA: Our MPC 4000 works best with the foomatic driver, the plc6 driver from ricoh would do the 'spit all the paper out trick'. But the spooler/translator in foomatic works great.\nhttp://www.linuxfoundation.org/collaborate/workgroups/openprinting/database/foomatic.\n", "Q: g.726 ADPCM codec stopped working in VLC After upgrading from 11.10 to 12.04 vlc can't work with codec g.726.\n[0x7fbdc80009c8] avcodec generic error: cannot open codec (G.726 ADPCM Audio)\n\nBut avplay works fine with this codec.\nHow can I fix it?\n\nA: Exact same thing happened to me after an update/upgrade: Avplay worked fine but vlc was jerky and distorted.\nNot sure if it is relevant but my Ubuntu is 12.04 EXTIX x64 is running in a VirtualBox guest.\nI found a workaround within, VLC by changing Tools -> Preferences -> Video -> output from \"Default\" to \"X11 Video Output(XCB)\".

I have a video where I want to put images on my hand (in the video) and have them fly all over the video screen. Is there any software for Ubuntu 11.10 to do this or at least to insert an image into the video in a custom position?\n\nA: kdenlive is more like a video editor which supports lots of audio/video/images formats, including mpg, flv, ogg, jpg, mp3, avi, wav, etc.\nIt is more like Sony Vegas in Windows and it allows you to merge between file formats/sources, this way you can put an image with transparency over a running video, change original audio and include effects, transitions, pan, zoom, crop, and other video effects. Color correction is also supported and it works project based, which allows you to create full scenes in a project and insert projects in a final project without rendering.\nSome screenshots of my desktop are provided here to illustrate what you want to do: I am placing a png with transparency image over a video, zooming and positioning over the video.\n\nHere we can see the media tracks, a video and a png image.\n\nIn this screenshot I am using pan and zoom plugin in order to resize and position the png over the video.\n\nAnd we are using the composition video transition all over the png image's duration in order to place it over the video.\nBTW: Pan and Zoom and other interesting plugins/video effects supports automation, which is useful for your desired \"to put images on my hand (in the video) and have them fly all over the video\"\nA video editor is what I suggest you for this task, any of them are fine but if you are used to Movie Maker, Sony Vegas, Adobe Premiere, and these kind of software, you will feel comfortable when using kdenlive.\nGood luck!\n\nA: FfDiaporama, (Windows equivilent - Pro-Show Gold) is an application for assembling photos and videos. It is inspired by presentation software such as Impress or Powerpoint . It can read all image formats, a majority of cameras and camcorder video formats, and the most commonly used music formats.\nIt includes 140 transitions and a device database for the generation of videos with more than 50 models of video viewing devices (including smartphones, tablets, and home cinema systems). ffDiaporama can manage several hundreds of slides. Every slide can contain several tens of shots and several tens of blocks. Every shot contains its own block settings.

First time with any OS other than Windows.\n\nA: Depending on what options you chose when installing, you may have just overwritten all those files.

Can anyone tell me how to enable Emacs keybind on Chrome?\nI found some links but they are either not clearly mentioning how to do so or not what I want (I don't want external tools to be run for this purpose).\n\nA: Cinnamon has its own settings:\ngsettings set org.cinnamon.desktop.interface gtk-key-theme \"Emacs\" # use emacs\ngsettings set org.cinnamon.desktop.interface gtk-key-theme \"Default\" # use default\n\n\nA: If you're using gtk3 the settings are in the libgtk-3-common package in /usr/share/themes/Emacs/gtk-3.0/gtk-keys.css and you can enable them with:\ngsettings set org.gnome.desktop.interface gtk-key-theme \"Emacs\"\n\nAnd to switch back:\ngsettings set org.gnome.desktop.interface gtk-key-theme \"Default\"\n\nIf you're using gtk2 the settings are in the libgtk2.0-common package in  /usr/share/themes/Emacs/gtk-2.0-key/gtkrc and you can enable them with:\ngconftool-2 --type=string --set /desktop/gnome/interface/gtk_key_theme Emacs\n\nAnd if you want to customize the keybindings you can copy the settings into ~/.themes/ with cp -r /usr/share/themes/Emacs ~/.themes/\nps. so does this mean you've managed to win the battle against Unity to steal all your modify keys back for Emacs to use?! :)\n\nA: Emacs keybindings for any gtk application except Google Chrome can be easily enabled, just follow the instruction you found.\nEmacs keybinding for Google Chrome however was not working at the time of your question (Dec 2012). This is a bug from upstream https://code.google.com/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=11480. It is working now.\nThe bug has been solved in 2013. But the version of Chromium shipped with Ubuntu 14.04 still was bugged, you can do a security update which will include a version of chromium (v36) with this bug fixed (but as with any other software, total number of bug does not reduce, that is, new features introducing new bugs to replace fixed ones. For me life is harder since i upgrade, because ideographs stopped displaying in tab names).\nIt seems the other answer offered to you was not aware that your question is Chromium-specific and Emacs keybindings really did not work in Chromium for many years until 2014.\n\nA: As of Chrome 59, which  switched to gtk3, set gtk-key-theme-name to Emacs in ~/.config/gtk-3.0/settings.ini:\n[Settings]\ngtk-key-theme-name = Emacs\n\n\nA: It didn't work for me until I turned on the \"Emacs input\" under \"Keyboard and Mouse\" in gnome-tweaks (command that brings up a settings GUI). I enabled and disabled the other options; only gnome-tweaks does it on my system.\nSo far, I've seen four proposed solutions (not counting GTK-2 based solutions, since Chrome has been GTK-3 for a while):\n\n*\n\n*gsettings set org.gnome.desktop.interface gtk-key-theme \"Emacs\"\n\n*[Settings] gtk-key-theme-name = Emacs in ~/.config/gtk-3.0/settings.ini\n\n*\"Emacs input\" in gnome-tweaks\n\n*Wait for Google to patch something that otherwise should work.\n\nAll of these seem to be different systems wrestling control over the keybindings, and one of them (or one not listed above) will win. This isn't a good situation, but be aware that you might need to go through the list.\nAlso, I quit and restarted Chrome in each experiment (though I didn't reboot my computer or X session). I don't know that this is necessary—I don't know if Chrome detects the keybindings \"live\" or checks for it at startup—but it made for cleaner experiments.\n", "Q: Updated to 12.04, Xorg won't start, using onboard XGI display Just updated one of my servers to 12.04 (from 10.04), and Xorg no longer starts, nor will lightdm or gdm.\nLooking in /var/log/lightdm/x-0.log: \nX.Org X Server 1.11.3\nRelease Date: 2011-12-16\nX Protocol Version 11, Revision 0\nBuild Operating System: Linux 2.6.42-23-generic x86_64 Ubuntu\nCurrent Operating System: Linux murph 3.2.0-23-generic #36-Ubuntu SMP Tue Apr 10 20:39:51 UTC 2012 x86_64\nKernel command line: root=/dev/md0 ro quiet splash \nBuild Date: 20 April 2012  05:12:02AM\nxorg-server 2:1.11.4-0ubuntu10.1 (For technical support please see http://www.ubuntu.com/support) \nCurrent version of pixman: 0.24.4\n        Before reporting problems, check http://wiki.x.org\n        to make sure that you have the latest version.\nMarkers: (--) probed, (**) from config file, (==) default setting,\n        (++) from command line, (!!) notice, (II) informational,\n        (WW) warning, (EE) error, (NI) not implemented, (??) unknown.\n(==) Log file: \"/var/log/Xorg.0.log\", Time: Tue Apr 24 10:51:50 2012\n(==) Using system config directory \"/usr/share/X11/xorg.conf.d\"\n(EE) Failed to load module \"xgi\" (module does not exist, 0)\n(EE) Failed to load module \"vesa\" (module does not exist, 0)\n(EE) Failed to load module \"fbdev\" (module does not exist, 0)\n(EE) Failed to load module \"xgi\" (module does not exist, 0)\n(EE) Failed to load module \"vesa\" (module does not exist, 0)\n(EE) Failed to load module \"fbdev\" (module does not exist, 0)\n(EE) No drivers available.\n\nFatal server error:\nno screens found\n\nPlease consult the The X.Org Foundation support \n         at http://wiki.x.org\n for help. \nPlease also check the log file at \"/var/log/Xorg.0.log\" for additional information.\n\n ddxSigGiveUp: Closing log\nServer terminated with error (1).

I am suffering from the bug which crashes Ubuntu when I click Alt+Tab: https://bugs.launchpad.net/unity/+bug/975168 .\nWhile I was doing a do-release-upgrade -d just now to install 12.04, I accidentally clicked Alt+Tab. Now Unity crashed, Alt+Ctrl+F2 doesn't work. All I have is a blank screen. Usually Unity used to restart by itself but it didn't this time.\nSo my question is, since the upgrade has already finished downloading the packages and was installing them during the crash, should I leave the PC alone as it maybe still installing in the background? Or should I restart it (by holding the power button or Ctrl+Alt+Delete)?\n\nA: The exact same thing happened to me. Here is my story:\n\n\n*\n\n*During upgrade Unity crashed and I basically had access to nothing; Couldn't even open a terminal with Ctrl+Alt+T. The hard disk was still working, so I figured the update was still running, and I left it.\n\n*Eventually the disk activity stopped, so I had to assume the update was complete and forced a log out with Alt+SysReq+K, then a restart.\n\n*Upon loading Ubuntu again, I noticed I was getting an incorrect screen resolution so I knew something was up. I managed to log in, then ran Updates and was given an error about the upgrade being interrupted.\n\n*I had to open a terminal, first tried: sudo apt-get install -f, but this told me that I needed to run sudo dpkg --configure -a\n\n*This seemed to resume the upgrade process where it had left off, so I left it for another while. I got a few console prompts about replacing my desktop defaults file, so I guess when I had restarted previously it was waiting for some such reply (but I had no way of seeing it).\n\n*After this completed, seemingly with no errors, I ran sudo apt-get install -f again just to be sure. After that I rebooted and everything seemed dandy. Phew.\n\n\nOf course if someone else has this problem their results may very, but maybe this will give someone some hope if their Unity crashes during the update (grr).\n\nA: Here is what I did and I managed to restart unity and continue upgrade normally\n\n\n*\n\n*Press Ctrl + Alt + F1 and logged in\n\n*killall unity-panel-service\n\n*killall compiz\n\n*ps ax | grep unity and killed everything with kill -9 pid#\n\n*Ctrl + Alt + F7\ndone\n\n", "Q: Java application font size I have downloaded a Java program with a GUI.

I couldn't find a link for it online which would have answered many questions. But on a general note, unless application specifically exposes an option inside its configuration file or as a commandline option for font, you cannot set a font size for the entire app. IMO, look inside a user manual that should tell you how to achieve this. \nhttp://publib.boulder.ibm.com/infocenter/javasdk/v6r0/index.jsp?topic=%2Fcom.ibm.java.doc.diagnostics.60%2Fdiag%2Fappendixes%2Fenv_var%2Fenv_jvm.html\nLink above talks about specifying a directory of fonts that will be avaliable to the application.

When I first tried to use my mobile to connect to the internet, I created a Mobile Broadband connection. I did this by opening Bluetooth > Preferences and ticking \"Access the Internet using your mobile phone (DUN)\". Usually, when my phone is within Bluetooth range I open the Network indicator, click on the mobile connection, and it is established.\nSometimes, however, this doesn't work and the Bluetooth connection times out. [1] Then, the only way I can establish an internet connection is to again open Bluetooth > Preferences and tick the box again. This creates a brand new Mobile Broadband connection. When I click on the new mobile connection, it works.\nHowever, I now have several duplicate mobile connections under my Network indicator. When I click on \"Edit Connections...\", they do not appear under the Mobile Broadband tab. Nor when I run gksu nm-connection-editor.\nWhere are they stored and how do I get rid of them?\n[1] I assume this is a bug. Advice what to do when it happens again so I can file it accurately would be appreciated :)\n\nA: NM connections are stored in /etc/NetworkManager/system-connections/\nI assume the bug is https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/gnome-bluetooth/+bug/822311\n\nA: I confirm that this still happens on 12.04 LTS\nThank you for the solution :) int_ua. \nDeleting the corresponding files in that location removed the duplicates.\nAdditionally, D3vid, if you want to avoid creating a duplicate, you can do the following:\nClick on the Network Indicator, and uncheck Enable Networking.\nThis disables networks. Next repeat the same, thus enabling networks.\nPreviously used network connections are now visible. You can use them instead of going to the bluetooth applet and creating a new connection.\nI find this takes lesser time than the bluetooth applet. \n", "Q: How can I get a ubuntu box to appear on the network as a streaming device for a iPad We're creating a solution which is basically a ubuntu desktop connected to a projector and managed by a iPad, is there something I can install on the ubuntu box so that I could play a video from youtube from the iPad, using the same thing you use to play to a Apple TV, so instead of 'View on Apple TV' it would be 'View on UbuntuBox'\n\nA: This should do the trick!\nshairport, allows you to stream from apple devices to your linux box just as if it was an airport or apple TB.

(Use fdisk or cfdisk and verify that any partition start and end numbers make basic sense.  fdisk at least will notice obvious things like illegal block values or end blocks before start blocks and warn you that the partition table is invalid.)\nparted/gparted may be able to identify filesystems for you.  Sometimes file -s can do so as well.\n\nA: sudo file -Ls /dev/sdb1 will give you more information.

So it is best to look at the online keybinding page: Ctrl-a ?.  You can also use the command prompt in screen: Ctrl-a :detach.  Myself, I generally remove the key bindings for 'detach' and 'powerdetach', except on remote systems.\n\nA: \nCreate screen using this command:\nscreen -S testscreen\n\n\nList the screen using this command: screen -ls\n\n\nAttache the screen using this command: screen -r testscreen\n\n\nAttache the multipurpose screen using this command (if already others are attached with the same screen): screen -x testscreen\n\n\nDetach the screen using this command: screen -X detach OR Ctrl+a+d\n\n\nKill the screen using this command: screen -XS testscreen kill\n\n\nTerminate the attached screen using: Ctrl+d\n\n\nA: Ctrl+a followed by d.

I have tried everything I can think of at this point and I'm at a total loss. \nI have a 2TB drive I want to install Windows 7 and 11.10 (both are 64 bit) side by side, but once I install Windows it must need gpt to work or something because no matter how many times I've removed it, it always returns. If I use gdisk and set the disk as mbr, Windows won't load. \nNow this last time I ran gdisk and tried to boot into Windows before I installed Ubuntu all the way and ended up at a grub rescue prompt. Any help please?\nAlso let me say I have been searching and reading for days and have tried everything I can find to make this work so this isn't a one time event, it's continual.\n\nA: To describe the situation with Ubuntu and Windows, allow me to give some background information. \nWhen you install Ubuntu, it installs something called GRUB. This loads first and can load either Windows or Ubuntu. Windows has something known as NTLDR or MSLDR which can only load Windows. \nThus, install Windows first(booting from the setup disk), saving room for Ubuntu (at least 20GB, but you can go into the terabytes), or if the Windows setup system does not allow you to make a partition smaller than the free space, then use the whole drive. \nOnce Windows is installed, begin to install Ubuntu (booting into the live CD). Be sure to specify the side-by-side option, or use the advanced partition tool and fill the rest of the drive with one Ext4 partition (resizing Windows partition if necessary). Click on the free space and then add to do this. Also, be sure to set this partition to mount as /. If it does not let you select the mount point, click on the new(EXT4) partition and click edit at the bottom while the partition is highlighted to specify this. Allow Ubuntu install to finish fully. \nWhen you reboot, you will be prompted to select between Windows and Ubuntu at startup (by GRUB), in which case you may select either.\n\nA: Run grub-update after both installations are finished for GRUB to find Windows. Although it may seem like this would be automatic, it is not. \nAlso, when installing Windows, the installer chooses to put its boot-loader on a known partition that is not the system partition, so it could be anywhere. If you use that partition for Ubuntu you will destroy GRUB's ability to access the information it needs to dual boot. \nTo avoid the situation determine you Windows partition during install and DO NOT create any other partitions at this time, forcing Windows to put it where it actually belongs. Install Ubuntu and run grub-update to make sure Windows loader is available and gets found.\n\nA: The usual cause of the symptom of Ubuntu's installer reporting a non-empty disk as having no partitions is a damaged partition table. Several distinct types of damage can cause this symptom. Some, but not all, of these involve stray GPT data on an MBR disk; others can occur on MBR disks or on plain GPT disks.\nThe MBR disk size limit is 2 TiB (2.2 TB), so a 2 TB disk is under that limit, and may use MBR. That's not to say that it does use MBR, though; it might use GPT. It's also possible that it was partitioned with GPT and then re-partitioned with MBR. Depending on the tools used, this can leave behind stray GPT data, which is one of the things that can cause the missing-partitions symptom. In this case, my FixParts program can fix the problem pretty easily.\nNote that Windows ties its firmware boot mode to its partition table type -- if a computer uses a conventional legacy BIOS, Windows will only boot from an MBR disk; and if the computer uses a new-style UEFI, Windows will only boot from a GPT disk. Thus, even on a sub-2TiB disk, GPT may be required, if the computer uses UEFI and is configured to boot in UEFI mode. (Most UEFI firmware provides a BIOS compatibility mode, which can greatly complicate matters if you don't understand it.) Linux is more flexible; it can boot from a GPT disk using either BIOS or UEFI, and (in theory) from an MBR disk using either BIOS or UEFI.\n", "Q: How can I permanently apply this workaround to get the backlight working on an eMachines E525? There is a display bug that I've been trying to find information on for a while now involving the \"eMachines E525 Notebook computer\" and it's \"backlight\", when using Ubuntu, Xubuntu, Lubuntu, and Kubuntu 11.04-11.10. Every time my computer gos to sleep the backlight gets shut off.\nAll I could find online was that I had to switch to the root of the system and edit the /etc/rc.local file, adding setpci -s 00:02.0 F4.B=00 before the exit 0 at the end of the file. I did, and when I restart the computer I can see that the backlight is on, however when the computer gos to sleep or the lid gets closed, the backlight goes off and I have to open \"Terminal\" and type in sudo setpci -s 00:02.0 F4.B=00.\nI guess my real question is, is there a line of code I could enter into the grub menu or the /etc/rc.local file to make the backlight stay on? If anybody has any possible fixes for this bug, and would like to share the information with me, it would be highly appreciated.\n\nA: Creating a script in /etc/pm/sleep.d/ to run the command should work.\ngksudo gedit /etc/pm/sleep.d/99_backlight\n\ncopy/paste the following:\n#!/bin/sh\n\n# run 'setpci -s 00:02.0 F4.B=00' when waking up\n\ncase \"$1\" in\n        thaw|resume)\n           setpci -s 00:02.0 F4.B=00\n            ;;\nesac\n\nsave and exit, then make it executable with \nsudo chmod +x /etc/pm/sleep.d/99_backlight\n\n", "Q: boot from usb thumb drive: the installed (octave) pkg not there and forever after, on subsequent boot!

When I want to kill a process via System Monitor I am presented with 2 quick ways, Kill Process and End Process. What is the difference between these two?\n\nA: I was curious too, so I just browsed through the source code and found the below in application.cpp. There is more to this code but I think these correlate to the options, at least for System Monitor 3.8.2.1 through 3.19.3:\n\n\n*\n\n*Stop Process = SIGSTOP (pause signal, let's you continue later with SIGCONT, does not kill process)\n\n*End Process = SIGTERM  (termination signal, the right way, the application can intercept this signal and intiate shutdown tasks such as temp file cleanup)\n\n*Kill Process = SIGKILL (kill signal, extreme, only use if SIGTERM doesn't work, won't intiate shutdown tasks)\n\n\nSee this question on Quora about SIGINT, SIGTERM, SIGKILL and SIGSTOP signals for a good explanation on all of the kill/quit/shutdown signals and their differences.\n\n\nA: Per the System Monitor manual, you should normally use \"End Process\", and only if that fails use \"Kill Process\":\n\nYou usually terminate a process only if you cannot end the process\n  normally as described in To End a Process.\n\nOn a technical level this makes me think that End Process sends a SIGQUIT, which allows the process to trap and perform cleanup if needed, but if that fails, Kill Process should send a SIGKILL which should violently terminate the process, without chance of recovery. Use sparingly!\n", "Q: How can I horizontally invert the video output of the webcam When I use for example Cheese I want that when I move my right hand, in the video and see myself moving the right hand of my image instead of me moving the left hand. What I mean with this is that if my move my right side, in the video the right side should move, not the left side (as seen through the eye of the webcam). Basically to invert horizontally the image.\n\nA: I think you'll need to create a launcher script for each application that needs this fix. For example, if you wanted a script for Skype that flips the video horizontally this should work:\n#!/bin/bash\nexport LIBV4LCONTROL_FLAGS=1 && LD_PRELOAD=/usr/lib32/libv4l/v4l1compat.so skype\n\nIf the image is not flipping correctly, try different values for LIBV4LCONTROL_FLAGS.

Yeah, In the bottom right corner it shows I'm connected and everything, but it shows that the internet isn't working. Wired that is; is not working. It always stops working at a certain time which is 9:00 o'clock. I use to have parental controls, but according to my step-dad it isn't there anymore. Can someone help?\n\nA: There are many ways that he could be setting parental controls.  Either by things like OpenDNS or via your router, including others.  Router would probably be the easiest and make the most sense. So we can start there. \nI'm not sure how old your router is but many new ones come automatically equipped with parental controls, and if you go to do a hard reset of the router it will actually turn the parental controls ON. \nIf you're not worried about getting in trouble with your father, my suggestion would be to go to the router and do a hard reset on the device.  You can find a reset button that can be accessed with a paperclip or pointed pen/pencil at the back of the device.  Hold the button down for 10/15 secs and it will hard reset the configuration settings.  \nThere will also be a home configuration URL on the back of the device.  For example most(if not all) of Linksys routers are 192.168.1.1.  Input the URL on the back of the router into your web browser.  It will take you to a login page, USUALLY the username and password is \"admin\" and \"password\" respectively.  This is based on device model though, and can sometimes differentiate. \nFrom here, you can access all the of the router settings and particularly, parental control settings.  Make sure all of these are set to OFF. \nNow, if this is an actual application like a Time Keeping app or a parental control software application and your family uses the same computer...you could just search the computer for the application via root and disable/modify it.  \n\nA: Try this one\nGo to the  terminal and type\nsudo gedit /etc/resolvconf/resolv.conf.d/base\n\nadd following in file, save and close\nnameserver 127.0.0.1\n\nrestart the system.\nIt worked in my case.\n", "Q: No root file system - Alternate CD + LVM I am trying to install 11.10 as dual boot with Windows 7.\nI have all partitioned well as you can see here:\nhttp://www.flickr.com/photos/42897978@N00/7111180385/\nI burned the Alternate CD ISO to a CD.\nBoot from it and followed instructions to Partitioning.\nThere, I configured the LVM partitions as follows:\nVolume Group\nubuntu-vg\n- Uses Physical Volume /dev/sda7 380GB\n- Provides Logical Volume home-lv 60GB\n- Provides Logical Volume root-lv 60GB\n- Provides Logical Volume swap-lv 6GB\nThat is all I want (note that my /boot is outside of LVM)\nThen when I say that all is Ok and to write it to disk and\ncontinue with the installation, I get the following error.\n!!

As you copy the files to a real unix-based system, those permissions become relevant. Since you are using the -p option on scp, you are retaining the permissions that Cygwin \"made up\". The receiving system either doesn't have a user with that UID, or at the very least your user account is not the one with that UID, so you do not have permission to even see the permissions. \nThe easiest way to fix this is to take ownership of the files on the linux side.\nchown $(whoami):$(whoami) ~/somefolder -R\nchmod 750 -R ~/somefolder/\n\nfrom the linux desktop, which will give you rwx permssions to the user, rx to the group, and no access to others. Or drop the -p from scp which should use your user account's UMASK to generate new permissions on the unix side\n\nA: Use an additional flag. From man scp:\n -p      Preserves modification times, access times, and modes from the original file.\n\n", "Q: Something like Parallels Desktop for Linux? I'm not normally a fan of mac software implementations, but recently I saw a copy of Parallels Desktop for mac that I was very much impressed by. I looked into parallel's offerings for Linux (I was initially excited that they developed for *nix) but found that it has essentially the same features as VMware. \nDoes anyone know if there is a software solution for linux that offers the level of integration that the current Parallels Deesktop for mac has?  I looked into wine for the programs I want to run and was very frustrated. I feel like all the ratings in their application database were fabricated honesty. I've tried wine once every Ubuntu release since 8.10 and have never gotten it to work stably.\n\nA: I have some experience with Xen, VMware and VirtualBox. Xen is not working for me because it has problems with everything where Linux needs really deep access to the hardware (3D acceleration in my case and sending the screen into power save mode). VMware and VirtualBox more or less provide the same features and I decided to go with VirtualBox because it is available via Ubuntu Software Center. Works nice for me, but is is not as good integrated into Linux as Parallels for the Mac.\n\nA: Virtual Box\nA quite stable actively developed alternative to Parallels Desktop for Ubuntu is Virtual Box. We may install a OSE edition from Ubuntu Software Center but to my experience it is better to run the most recent version from the Oracle Repository (see this answer for installation). This will not only give you up to date bug fixes but also enables USB2.0 and RDP support.\nThere is quite a high lever of integration to the Ubuntu host OS:\n\n*\n\n*Virtual Box can be run with different levels of desktop integration from running a virtualized OS in a separate window, in full screen mode or in \"Seamless Windows\" mode to integrate guest application windows on the desktop of the host.\n\n*Sharing directories can be achieved by \"Shared Folders\" or through fully integrated network solutions.\n\n*Clipboard content is available from guest to host and vice versa.\n\n*Most USB-devices are fully accessible (in the PUEL version with USB2.0 support).\n\n*Virtual Box is scriptable, i.e. can easily be run and maintained from the command line (or remotely through SSH).\n\nThe main advantage however is that Virtual Box is Open Source and cross-platform. This gives you the possibility to export and run your virtual machines on any host OS supported.\n\nA: Virtual Box seems to be the best solution. As another user mentioned, it is script-able, so while built-in seamless levels aren't as high as Parallels, with some scripting, it can be achieved. One of the reasons the seamless isn't as high as Parallels, is precisely because 2 different installs of windows say, can have things in different places.\nI have written some scripts that act as pass-through associations to say open a word document in word. Changed the shutdown buttons to send shutdown commands to the VM and wait for the VM to shutdown properly. Set the windows VM to launch at login. Set the VM to shutdown on logout.  I left sleep and hibernate alone, as linux seems to do an excellent job of sleeping every open app, including the VM. However, on some hardware it would be necessary to address that as well. \n", "Q: How To rotate syslog daily? I want to rotate my syslog daily... How do I do this?

The following fixes this issue:\nsudo rm /var/lib/ubuntu-release-upgrader/release-upgrade-available\n\nThis file is safe to remove as it will be regenerated next time the motd script runs if appropriate.\n\nReason: this issue came up for me in 13.04 after a partially completed release upgrade which I completed with apt-get distupgrade. If the stamp file in /var/lib/ubuntu-release-upgrader/release-upgrade-available exists and has a message that a new release is available, it is shown on every login via the motd script: /etc/update-motd.d/91-release-upgrade, which calls /usr/lib/ubuntu-release-upgrader/release-upgrade-motd to update the stamp if it's empty. See these files for more info on why this hangs around.\n\nA: This can also happen if apt is configured to use a proxy and the proxy does not work properly. In my case the file /etc/apt/apt.conf.d/01proxy contained the line \nAcquire::http::Proxy \"http://proxy.local:9999\";\n\nand the server proxy.local was not responding. Removing this line fixed the \"No new release found\" issue with the graphical and terminal update tool.\n\nA: Check /etc/update-manager/release-upgrades\nPrompt=lts\n\nwill cause upgrade to fail if the release you are currently on is not an LTS one.\nSolution:\nChange Prompt=lts to Prompt=normal and save the changes\nDo the required upgrades until you have installed a LTS release.\nThen change back to Prompt=lts\nDone.\n\nA: To upgrade from Ubuntu 11.10 or Ubuntu 10.04 LTS on a server or system: install the update-manager-core package if it is not already installed; launch the upgrade tool with the command sudo do-release-upgrade -d; and follow the on-screen instructions. Note that the server upgrade is now more robust and will utilize GNU screen and automatically re-attach in case of e.g. dropped connection problems. \n\nA: In my case, a running 12.04 will not offer to upgrade to 12.10. The reason is because there are compatibility issues with my video hardware in 12.10. The tools told me after I tried to force the upgrade.\n\nA: I had the problem with 12.04 - > 13.04 and it was fixed by using -d option as guided coleman/Kagan above i.e.:\ndo-release-upgrade -d\n\n\nA: For old releases that have reached their EOL cycle, you can try this: \nDownload the meta-release info locally with this instruction: \nhttps://askubuntu.com/a/502485/34298\n\nA: It's possible to happen if you are using do-release-upgrade under socks client (proxychains or tsocks command). Your socks server or socks client does not support DNS lookup.

But another option is to use EasyBCD to boot GRUB and then boot Ubuntu. I tried to outline how to do this in this answer.\nNote that this does NOT boot Windows directly. Instead, the Windows boot manager boots GRUB so you go from the Windows menu to the GRUB menu.\nWhile I don't know if it is even possible to boot Ubuntu directly from the Windows loader, I am sure this is not a good idea. Mostly because Ubuntu does not know how to (or want to)  update anything other than GRUB when a updated Linux kernel is installed.\n", "Q: Can I install Ubuntu inside Windows? Ubuntu 12.04 won't come with the Windows Installer (Wubi) pre-added. But is there any way to install 12.04 using Wubi?\n\nA: The daily 12.04 iso I have here when burnt has wubi. Get that, burn it and then open it in windows.\n\n\nA: Wubi is still on the 12.04 CD but the ability to install inside Windows from CD has been disabled. The only way to do it is to run wubi.exe standalone available here.\nFor 12.04 they have simply hobbled wubi.exe to not offer the option to install, which you can bypass with a command-line option e.g. if your CD drive is D: you can go to a command line and run:\nD:\\wubi.exe --force-wubi\n\nThe intention is to replace wubi.exe on the CD ISO in future releases with a dedicated CD Boot Helper, and then maintain wubi.exe as a separate executable. That appears to be the plan.\nHere is the rationale behind disabling it, which was posted by Canonical's Rick Spencer on the ubuntu-devel mailing list:\n\nHello all,\nThis email regards wubi, a tool used to set up Ubuntu in a dual boot\n  configuration in a manner that does not require disk partitioning.\n  Wubi is a windows program. It is currently delivered as a standalone\n  executable downloadable from the web, as well as part of official\n  Ubuntu images. You can read about wubi in the excellent user guide:\n  https://wiki.ubuntu.com/WubiGuide\nI am proposing a small but notable change to how we deliver wubi for\n  12.04. I am proposing that:\n  \n  \n*\n  \n*We continue to test and bug fix wubi.exe as the separate Windows program\n  \n*We cotinue to offer wubi.exe for download as the separate Windows program.\n  \n*We disable the ability to do a wubi installation from the Ubuntu 12.04 ISOs. (wubi will remain on the images for the purpose of providing Windows users some feedback and functionality if they put a\n  Ubuntu CD into a running Windows computer, but won't offer to\n  install).\n  \n  \n  Separating the wubi.exe experience from the ISOs will give us the\n  following important benefits:\n  \n  \n*\n  \n*We will be able to do maintenance and enhancements to wubi outside of the Ubuntu development cycle.\n  \n*Significant reduciton of QA work for an already over-streched QA team.\n  \n*Better overall 12.04 quality, and less stress at release time.\n  \n*We won't get stuck with a poor (or worse) user experience on the CD since is a good chance that wubi will not work properly with\n  Windows 8.\n  \n  \n  I am proposing these changes to the plan because:\n  \n  \n*\n  \n*The key use case for wubi is being able to download and run the installer on Windows, not installing from the ISO.\n  \n*Wubi is difficult to test, so has been difficult to assure that it will meet the quality standards we have set for 12.04.\n  \n*There are no developers treating wubi as their top priorities. This combined with the QA difficulties has historically caused late\n  breaking changes that add stress at release time and frequentily\n  invalidate already executed ISO testing.\n  \n*Most significantly, Windows is changing it's boot system with Windows 8, and it's not clear how wubi will work with Windows 8, if at\n  all.\n  \n  \n  Cheers, Rick\n\nHere is the bug report that documents the request to disable install from CD.\nNote:\nRunning wubi.exe standalone will download a preinstalled tar.xz image. You can still place the Desktop CD ISO in the same directory as wubi.exe and install it like that without downloading the ~500MB tar.xz image.\n\nA: Yes you can install Ubuntu 12.04 using WUBI, just download the WUBI.exe here Download Ubuntu Desktop | Ubuntu, then execute it, it will download the iso file. \nHowever if you already done downloading the iso file you can use it, just mount it using DAEMON TOOL, download it here DAEMON Tools Lite v4.48.1 (with SPTD 1.84) or any where, then execute the WUBI.exe you download from. \nNOTE: stay offline so that it will not download the iso file, instead of downloading the file from the net, it will get the file from the daemon)\nJUST LEAVE your question.. if there is..\n", "Q: Why does Ubuntu One Files for Android app create an entry in the 'Accounts and Sync' section of the Android settings menu?

This is closely linked to the reprographic\n  technique of 'trapping'. Another use of overprinting is to create a\n  rich black (often regarded as a colour that is \"blacker than black\")\n  by printing black over another dark colour.\n\nThis is an issue for us, as we're trying to print documents that need flattening (this is what overprinting does).\nAm I missing something here, is there a way to enable overprinting on printed PDFs?\nNote: Please don't confuse simulate overprinting with overprint preview, of which doesn't apply when printing.\nJust to show you what I'm looking for, this is the Print > Advanced screen...\n\nAnd this is what I see on the Ubuntu screen, not no option for overprinting\n\n\nA: Is the following procedure an option for you?\n\n\n*\n\n*Use (a very recent version of) Ghostscript to apply the SimulateOverprint option to your original file.\n\n*Use the output of Ghostscript to send to the printer.\n\n\nThe Ghostscript command would be:\ngs -sDEVICE=pdfwrite          \\\n   -o simulated-overprint.pdf \\\n   -dSimulateOverprint=true   \\\n    orig.pdf\n\n\nA: To view this option try install original Adobe Reader for Windows or MacOS to their corresponding virtual machine (vm).  \nPDF format development depends on the proprietary library controlled by Adobe. Not surprising option do not exist. Look this comparison chart:\nComparison of OpenXPS and PDF\nMost interesting moment here is two rows:\nAlpha channel in color definitions - OpenXPS: Yes - PDF: Not\nSupport for multiple transparency blending modes  - OpenXPS: ? - PDF: Yes\nMany different ways exist to to view PDF and print it under Linux.  \nI count this question point to the problem around original PDF representation inside Ubuntu environments.

It just runs on my 540M, when I put \"optirun\" before the \"wine\" command.\nBut, for simple OpenGL Applications i don't need the power of my dedicated GPU.\nI've used the offical bumblebee instalation guide, therefore i've installed, the Packages like \"virtualgl-libs:i386, libgl1-mesa-glx:i386, libc6:i386\" of course.\nSo, what can i do to get my OpenGL accerleration on 32-Bit Applications working again?\nThank you very much for your help!\n- PhenomZ\nBTW: My system sould by up to date.

In Bumblebee version before 3.0-2~...ppa1, installing the bumblebee package also installs bumblebee-nvidia which on its turn installs nvidia-current.\nThe nvidia-current package installs both the 64-bit and 32-bit libraries on a 64-bit system. These OpenGL libraries conflict with the Mesa OpenGL library, package libgl1-mesa-glx. (read: breaks OpenGL capabilities on systems where the primary X server does not use the nvidia driver like an Optimus laptop)\nThe bumblebee-nvidia package tries to repair this by setting the default OpenGL library to the Mesa one for installed architectures. Initially, only libgl1-mesa-glx:amd64 is installed. So, unless libgl1-mesa-glx:i386 is installed before, OpenGL gets broken for 32-bit architectures.\nThe solution is to first install libgl1-mesa-glx:i386, and then install Bumblebee. virtualgl-libs:i386 can be installed at any time and will also be installed like bumblebee-nvidia in later versions. New installations will automatically pull in the drivers in the right order.\nIf you've already installed Bumblebee, simply install libgl1-mesa-glx:i386 and reinstall bumblebee-nvidia.\n", "Q: How do I prevent skype from starting another instance when it's already running? \nUpdate\nThis problem is finally fixed with Skype 4.0.0.7 for Linux. This makes the question obsolete for every one who installed Skype directly from the website. Version 4.0+ will be included in the universe repositories for Quantal (Ubuntu 12.10).\n\n\nJust a little unnecessary annoyance to fix here:\nSuppose you have Skype for Ubuntu running. You accidentally click on the launcher again. The way it is now, Skype starts a second instance, which promptly tells you it can't log in. There is another instance already running. To make things worse: On the next regular start of Skype it you will have to re-enter your saved password, due to the \"Sign in failure\".\nI thought this would be fixed soon but neither Canonical nor Microsoft care enough. The annoyance continues to exist for the last three updates at least. So in an approach to provide a workaround I will post what I've done to prevent this behaviour. Maybe it's useful for some of you. Maybe it will rise awareness and cause a fix.\nI'm happy for any better solution btw. and that's the real purpose of my question. Usually I don't answer them myself. So doesn anyone know of a better solution to fix dual instancing of Skype?\n\nA: So here is what I have done to prevent Skype from starting another instance:\nI have renamed the executable:\nmv /usr/bin/skype /usr/bin/skype.bin\n\nThe original skype executable will be linked to a script that only starts skype if no other instance is running (here a softlink). Here is the small script that I called skype-wrapper.sh. It checks if the user is already running skype:\n#!/bin/bash\n# Use this instead of the Skype executable in '/usr/bin/skype' to prevent\n# Skype from running another instance. Rename the executable to 'skype.bin'\n# beforehand.\n\nif [ $# -gt 0 ]; then\n    /usr/bin/skype.bin $@\nelif [ ! -n \"$(lsof /usr/bin/skype.bin | grep $USER)\" ]; then\n    /usr/bin/skype.bin \nfi\n\nYou can link it to the original name of the skype executable like this:\nln -s /home/con-f-use/bin/skype-wrapper.sh /usr/bin/skype\n\nThat of course has one drawback: After a Skype update one has to redo the renaming of the executable and linking of the script.\nAgain, open for a better solution or even a fix of Skype itself (looking at you Microsoft :-)\nEdit:\nAs said in the comments, there was a minor problem with the notification icon of skype (a click on it wouldn't toggle hide/display of the Skype window). That is now fixed (and tested with Ubuntu 10.04, 11.04 and 12.04).\nEdit2:\nWith the latest version from www.skype.com (by the time of writing it was 4.0.0.7), as opposed to the one currently in the repositories, the error is fixed. I expect that the fixed version at some point will find it's way into the Ubuntu repositories.\n", "Q: Where do I report packaging bugs?

I've got a 2 TB external HDD.\nThe HDD is partitioned into 3 partitions:\n200 mb efi partition and two about 1 TB Fat32 partitions.\nFormatting the whole drive isn't an option because there is important data on the drive.\nIs there a way to delete the EFI partition without affecting the other two partitions?\n\nA: Yes; using any disk partition editor, including gparted or the gnome disk utility.\n\nA: The ESP is created automatically by some tools on disks over a certain size. Apple's Disk Utility does this, for instance. As psusi says, it's not needed for a non-boot disk (or even a disk with a bootable OS, if its boot loader resides elsewhere), but it also does no harm. A 200 MB ESP is 0.01% of the total space on a 2 TB disk. This is a trivial amount, and to reclaim this space, you'd need to erase and re-create your first partition or resize the partition backward from its starting point. Either operation will be a hassle, and could result in data loss. Thus, I recommend just leaving it in place unless you have some compelling reason (say, to keep partition numbers aligned across multiple backup disks) or if you need to delete and re-create that first partition for other reasons.\n", "Q: How to solve GNOME power manager installation problem?

This is done via NVIDIA's TwinView mode. When I run the following command:\nx11vnc -safer -localhost  -once -display :0 -ncache 10 -ncache_cr -geometry 3840x1080\n\nand connect from a Windows machine with TightVNC, my connection lists the resolution as 3840x12960. That is 12 x 1080 if you don't feel like doing the math. The top part of the VNC connection looks normal but I can scroll down A LOT and I see ghosts of previous windows. \nAny idea why or how to stop this?\n\nA: I FINALLY fixed this by disabling client side caching, use the -noncache option when starting the server or uncheck the ncache option in the gui. \nAnswer found here: http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=1337060\n\nA: It seems your VNC viewer doesn't support client-side caching.\nSo you should either use VNC viewer which supports it, or you need to remove -ncache (an experimental) option from your x11vnc command. In case it's enabled by default, try to disable it by specifying -noncache option.\nBasically when it is enabled, it activates the client-side caching scheme which stores pixel data offscreen on the VNC viewer side for faster retrieval and it should work with any VNC viewer. However it seems it's not working correctly with some clients.\n\nAs per Ubuntu forum thread, this is how -ncache works.\n\nIt makes a desktop 10X taller than the normal height and uses the extra framebuffer for caching windows and their saveunders.\nIf you can't get KRDC to not show you that region (e.g. by resizing its window) then you can't use KRDC with x11vnc -ncache.\nSo for now the only -ncache \"support\" is for a viewer to be able to have a scrollbar and to be able to disable auto-scrolling. Or on unix/macosx use ssvnc.\n\nSee: Can x11vnc do client-side caching of pixel data? for further information.\n\nThe n in -ncache n is the factor of increase over the base framebuffer size to use for caching. It is an even integer and should be fairly large, 6-12, to achieve good response. This usually requires about 50-100MB of additional RAM on both the client and server sides. For example with n=6 a 1280x1024 display will use a framebuffer that is 1280x7168: everything below row 1024 is the pixel buffer cache.\n\n", "Q: dual boot-ubuntu and windows partition problem i just bought a laptop with ubuntu pre-installed.Because my linux skills are not good at all i prefer to have both OS on my computer.My trouble is:when i try to boot the windows installer, i always get the blue-screen. \nFrom my researches it is caused by the MBR partition that is in conflict with the windows FAT/NTFS.I tried to set up another partition from the Linux disk utility but was unable to modify anything.I always get that editing or modifying the partition cannot be done.\nCan you help me?i need the time to know Linux better, because not even the internet is not working on this laptop,for me to at least have the chance to learn more.\n\nA: Giuliano, you don't mention how it is that you are trying to install Windows into your computer. Does it have a CD drive? If so, you must insert the intallation CD and press  or  while booting to enter the BIOS config and enable boot from CD (do not set it as default boot medium) and then  or  to access the boot menu. Boot from the Windows CD. It's possible to make a bootable USB drive too but I won't dwelve into it. It will be required later.\nWhat is VERY IMPORTANT is that previously you must make a partition for Windows. This is probably the culprit. \nTo do this you must first use Gparted to reduce the Ubuntu partition and make way for a Windows partition. !! SAVE THE CHANGES!! Then you create a new NTFS partition in the empty space. For good measure, format it as NTFS.\nFor good measure, in case something goes wrong, download the image of the Ubuntu you are running and make a live CD or USB drive. In any case you will need it to repair GRUB after you install windows.\nShut down the computer and boot into the Windows CD. You will be able to install it into the empty NTFS patition. After Windows is installed, you will find that you lost the ability to boot into Ubuntu; Windows will have overwritten the boot sector.\nTo remedy this, boot with your Ubuntu Live CD (or better yet your bootable Ubuntu USB). To reinstall GRUB follow this link: http://www.webupd8.org/2009/12/how-to-recover-grub2-linux.html. If you have a Live USB and allowed some space on it to install some programs, find \"Grub-Customizer\" with a G search and install it in your USB Drive. It has a nice and intuitive graphical interface and will allow you to repair grib in a minute. Choose your default boot system and you're done.\nIf you need more detailed explanations, let us know where you're stuck.\n\nA: Giuliano, if you do decide do do a thorough clean install of both OS's, the advisable order is this:\n\n\n*\n\n*Get an external storage medium large enough to back-up all your data. If it's sufficient, back-up your existen Windows installation as well. There might be some data and configuration files you may later need. It will only mean some extra cups of cofee while the copy is made.\n\n*Boot your PC with the Ubuntu live CD, so you can access all your partitions. Now make your back-up.\n\n*With GParted, zap all partitions one by one until you have a continous empty space. You may need to be saving the changes after each removal.\n\n*Still in GParted, format all your Hard Drive as NTFS. Shut down.\n\n*Boot from the Windows install CD and make a fresh install. Verify it's working and install the essentials. Don't mess with partitions just yet. Shut down.\n\n*Boot again from the Ubuntu Live CD (or USB Drive which is waaaay faster). Go into GParted.\n\n*Reduce the Windows partition to a reasonable size for the OS plus programs. In my last laptop it was 100Mb, now I have a 750Mb HD and I assigned 150Mb to it. You can now label it too for easy ID. OS1 or Win7 for example, are quite positive identifiers.\n\n*In the empty space install a new NTFS partition for your data, give it the total available space. Label it DATA or whatever you wish. Save changes.\n\n*Now, proceed to install Ubuntu. Choose the third option (\"Something Else\"). Use GParted to ceate a 3d partition to install Ubuntu. Give it some 30Gb if your space is tight, 100Mb if you can affor it. Point the MOUNTING POINT to dev/sda. DO NOT point it to dev/sda1 or dev/sda2 or whatever partition you find. Just point it to the MAIN DRIVE.\n\n*Start the install. Ubuntu will put GRUB2 in the boot sector, replacing Windows MBR and will set Ubuntu as the default OS. That will be changed later at will.\n\n*Once the install is finished, shut down, remove the Live CD and boot normally. Check you can start Windows and Ubuntu.\n\n*Boot back into Ubuntu and install GParted which will have disappeared. Then download a nifty app called Grub-Customizer (the sofware center will find it for you). With this you can choose which OS boot as default or to boot the last OS used.\n\n*Restore your data to the reserved NTFS partition.\n\n*Lastly make that partition R/W to both Windows and Ubuntu. In Ubuntu it will appear as an external disk under /media/.\n\n*Now to break stones re-configuring both systems to your liking.\nI hope this helps. Set aside some three or four hours for the whole process. A weekend is usually best.\nRegards from Mexico,\n--Jorge.\n", "Q: Dualboot windows and Ubuntu but automatically boot in Ubuntu I sometimes need Windows for some school projects.

And if i press and hold \"Shift\" i will see the grub loader and will be able to choose Windows\n\nA: The way Ubuntu should be set up by default in dual boot mode is that you will see a menu for some seconds to choose the OS from. \n\nShown here for 10.04 LTS and Windows XP but similar in later releases\nIf you don't see it, make it visible by pressing and holding the left SHIFT key while booting.\n\n\n\n*\n\n*In case you look for a way to reboot into Windows see this question.\n\n*For a way to reduce the time until Grub loads the default entry see this question\n\n*To change the default boot entry have a look at this answer\n\nA: You can easily set up your Grub to launch into any OS you have on the HDD, install Windows first then resize the partition and install Ubuntu, you can use the GRUB GUI editor as below:\nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:danielrichter2007/grub-customizer\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get install grub-customizer\n\n\nA: Don't know how to configure it, but you can configure grub to show the menu and accept a default after a few seconds timeout. It is also possible to automatically select the option during last boot. \n", "Q: Unsatisfied Link Error and missing .so files when starting Eclipse I upgraded to the 12.04 beta yesterday.

Is it necessary to post a screen-shot for that?  \n\nA: .deb is a Debian Package which you can install in Ubuntu via Software Centre. It's native for GNU/Linux systems. On the contrary if you can lay your hands on a Windows version of Team Viewer, it can work through wine, mostly as silver. Check the details in WineHQ applications database.\n[edit]\nYes, you can create a .deb package which runs an application using WINE. Every .deb binary package consists of at least three files:\n\n\n*\n\n*debian-binary (description text file)\n\n*control.tar.gz (installation, post-installation and pre-removal scripts)\n\n*data.tar.gz (precompiled app and it's resources)\n\n\nInstallation scripts from control can copy any structure of files and folders from data including preconfigured WINEPREFIX, also a specific WINE version and all of it's dependencies can be embeded along with a post-installation script that creates menu shortcuts with proper environment variables.\n\nA: Yes.

That's, if you are using TeamView meant for Windows OS.\n\n*The .deb file can be run as direct installation in Linux. Probably, you downloaded the one for Ubuntu architecture. And, to run it simply double-click on the downloaded Teamview .ded file and install it from the Ubuntu Software Center where it directs you to.\n\n*I don't think .ded file can be run by wine. Most files with .exe run with wine. Wine simply allows windows native applications to run in Linux. So .ded won't run with it.\nI hope that helps!\n", "Q: Would adding more RAM increase my speed in Ubuntu, and how hard is this to do? I've got a Compaq 6910p 14 inch laptop with 1GB RAM, 2.0ghz Core2Duo and a Mobility Radeon x2300. I was wondering if \n\n\n*\n\n*Adding more RAM would help my computer \n\n*If I add RAM, will I have to reinstall ubuntu, do something special etc.\n\n\nA: I've got a Compaq 6910p 14 inch laptop with 1GB RAM, 2.0ghz Core2Duo and a Mobility Radeon x2300.\n\n\n*\n\n*You mean this one? Here is a link to what I believe is the service manual.\nYour laptop takes 1 or 2 667-MHz/PC2-5300 SO-DIMMs. One of them is easy to access and replace since it is under a removable cover on the bottom of the laptop. (See Expansion memory module, page 48 in the service manual.)\nTo replace the other you need to remove the keyboard. (Primary memory module, page 59.)\n\n*An easy way to determine what your options are would be to locate and open the panel on the back for the Expansion memory module.\nIf there is a (512MB) SO-DIMM present then that means the most RAM you could have installed without replacing the SO-DIMM under the keyboard is 2.5 GB.\nHopefully the expansion slot will be empty. This would mean you could install a 2 GB SO-DIMM in the expansion slot for a total of 3 GB.\n\n\nI was wondering if adding more RAM would help my computer.\n\n\n*\n\n*I think enough has already been said about this in the other answers. If it was me, I'd consider going to 2.5 or 3GB if it was not a hassle. Up to you if you want to go to 4GB since this would involve replacing the RAM under your keyboard.\n\n\nIf I add RAM, will I have to reinstall ubuntu, do something special etc.\n\n\n*\n\n*Essentially, no. Ubuntu (or any modern OS for that    matter) will simply recognize and use the extra memory when it starts up.\nThere is a somewhat tedious issue of how much of the installed memory Ubuntu will actually use. But this really only matters if you install more than 3GB of RAM. Otherwise it's probably not worth bothering about unless you are curious.\n\n\nA: More RAM is useful if you are having lockups or sudden high disk activity as your system is using swap as it has run out of RAM.(Sometimes it uses swap even with lots of free RAM, but that is not harmful) It will help you with processing large amounts of bulky data, as will a CPU upgrade. As long as you don't exceed 3.5 GB, you won't need to change your kernel to use PAE, and you can just boot to Ubuntu and enjoy your new RAM. \nI personally just use the xubuntu-desktop package from synaptic instead of Gnome as Gnome is sometimes a resource hog for me but Xubuntu works perfectly and is quite customizable. If you want to stick with Gnome, I do suggest at least 1.5GiB RAM, as your CPU looks fine. It may also help if you pick Ubuntu 2D at logon(From the wrench menu on newer versions, and at the bottom on older versions) as the regular mode can be quite a honeypot without great functional improvement.\n\nA: More RAM is always good as Linux uses this for cache so it will help, especially with modern web browsers eating up your RAM. \nYou don't need to do anything special when adding RAM to Ubuntu, when it powers up it'll just see it and use it. RAM is really cheap these days, if you can max out the RAM your laptop holds you'll have a much snappier experience.\n\nA: *\n\n*Probably, I suggest you to have a look in the System Monitor. If you see a lot swap usage, the disk may be relieved a bit by adding more RAM.\n\n*No you don't have to reinstall, Ubuntu will pick it up automatically\n\n\nBefore buying more RAM, I suggest you to look on the Internet whether it's possible to upgrade your laptop memory or not. Some laptops seems to be build in such a way that adding new RAM requires you to remove the whole bottom. Also, check whether you've actual a second free slot for RAM. Manufacturers tend to put two smaller memory modules in as its cheaper.\nWhen buying RAM for a laptop, be sure to buy SODIMM RAM, desktop RAM modules do not fit in a laptop. The frequency should be at least the level of your current RAM as the slowest module determines the actual speed.\n\nA: Adding more RAM will increase the number of tasks that you will be able to perform in your laptop without \"feeling\" that your computer \"is slow\", but your computer will be the same unless you change some architecture on it, basically: \n\n\n*\n\n*The MicroProcessor: the faster = the best. The tasks are processed by the CPU and not by the RAM, understanding this, we can\nsay that your computer will be \"faster\" if you use a faster CPU.\n\n*The File System Bus, which in certain cases is limited on laptop's motherboards. The wider the file system bus is, will allow\nthe microprocessor to gather data from/to your devices and this way\nthe computer will \"feel\" fast, but in fact the tasks are being\nprocessed based on the speed of your CPU.\n\n\nI have an analogy for this:\nImagine that you have in an office 3 things:\n\n\n*\n\n*A man who will process the information in a desktop. (analog for the\nCPU)\n\n*The desktop (analog for the RAM) and\n\n*the file room, a place where the documents are filed. (analog for\nData devices, hard disk drive, etc.)\n\n\nWith this analogy, the man (CPU) will process as many information as can fit on his desktop (RAM), information which is gathered from the file room. If the file room is having a feeder and short distance (file system bus), the man will gather the documents faster, put it on the desktop, process it and give results.\nIf you have an old man (slower CPU), he will delay doing his tasks, if the man is having a small desktop, will process just a little bit of information at once and if the file room is far or is having another old man feeding the documents, you can say what the results will be.\nIn a different scenery: a young man in roller blades will go fast for the information, in a giant desktop will be able to process lots of information and give results in a snap.\nAnyway, improving just something will give the \"feeling\" that everything seems to be working \"fast\" but it is not, unless you arrange the items in a way that the data runs fast from place to place.\nThere is another considerations: The GPU (graphics card). The fastest that the results can be drawn on the Monitors, you will feel that the computer is working \"faster\". But remember, it's just an optical illusion. The data is being processed in the same way, but it is being drawn faster.\nGood luck!\n\nA: While a definitive answer would depend on knowing exactly what programs you use, etc., 1 gig of RAM is not very much these days. Dollar for dollar, I suspect you will see more benefit from adding memory than anything else. RAM is inexpensive.  Amazon, for example, is selling 8 gigs for around $40.\nResearch how to add memory to your laptop, and find out what kind of memory it requires. Then, look around for the best price.\n\nA: High suggestion to add more what you can pay for.\nWhatever it is Ubuntu or Mac OS X or Windows. More RAM will better on today heavy application, such as FireFox for internet open with multi tab etc.\nJust unplug your notebook battery and power, then lose it back open the case, replace the old RAM, that is it.\nJust before buy new RAM, need know that it is DDR2 or DDR3.\n", "Q: How to disable \"ctrl + alt + Fn\" shortcut? I'd like to use Ctrl + Alt + F4 shortcut (in Eclipse), but it's caught by Ubuntu and I cannot find, how to disable it. \nThanks \n\nA: *\n\n*Go to System settings... -> Keyboard Layout -> Options...,  \n\n*unwind Miscellaneous compatibility options,  \n\n*check Special keys (Ctrl+Alt+<key>) handled in a server.\n\n\nPlease, be aware it will also disable some other shortcuts (e.g. ctrl+alt++ and ctrl+alt+- used to switch video modes).\n", "Q: is /boot partition needed after OS is booted? I have an encrypted root partition (main hard drive) and my /boot is on a usb drive with a certain section of the usb drive's bits acting as the key for the encrypted partition. \nOf course I have to have this thumb drive attached to boot into the OS, however my I am wondering if it is OK to unmount /boot and remove that USB drive after the OS is booted?\n\nA: No, /boot isn't needed during normal system operation. In fact, it doesn't need to be mounted at all, since only the bootloader reads /boot, not Linux itself. You can add noauto to the /boot line in your /etc/fstab. There are even weird setups (or not-so-weird embedded setups, not running Ubuntu but this isn't distribution-specific) where Linux is booted from another operating system where the kernel isn't stored in a place that's accessible by Linux.\nThe times when you'll want to mount /boot are when you upgrade your kernel or your bootloader, or change their configuration.\n", "Q: Clean up files after a process dies I have an application that does a lot of forking, and every fork uses quite a lot of temp disk space. Currently, all of this space is used in /tmp. For various reasons, I want to clean up these tmp files asap after the process dies, preferably instantly.\nThe problem is that in many cases, the proc are terminated irregularly; hence the process itself should not be responsible for cleaning up its tmp files. What would be a nice way to set this up so that tmp files are removed when the process dies?\nI was thinking about writing files to /tmp/myapp/$pid/ and then having a cron job every second or so that searches for directories /tmp/myapp/$pid/ and unlinks the ones for which there is no active process with that ID. But that might create a lot of overhead. Also for fun I tried if I could actually put the dir inside of the proc mkdir /proc/12345/tmp but that doesn't fly either :-)\n\nA: If you have access to the source code, you can use tmpfile() function to create an \"anomymous\" temporary file - a file is created and immediately unlinked - the application is able to write to it but as soon as the file is closed the space occupied by the file is freed. This is a common way to create temporary files in Unix, as I understand.\n\nSYNOPSIS\n   #include <stdio.h>\n\n   FILE *tmpfile(void);\n\nDESCRIPTION\n   The  tmpfile()  function  opens  a unique temporary file in binary read/write (w+b) mode.  The file will be\n   automatically deleted when it is closed or the program terminates.\n\n\nIf you don't have access to the source code you may try to just delete everything from /tmp/myapp/$pid/ periodically - the process will still be able to write to the file even if it's unlinked from the directory, but again the disk space will be freed as soon as the last file handle is closed.\nThe above approaches would not work if any tempfiles are opened, closed and then opened again or if they're used by multiple processes.\nRelated question on stackoverflow:

before me had the following problem that after installing Ubuntu (with windows 7 already installed), the grub boot loader wouldnt show windows 7 as a boot option, though i can boot fine if I use the

repair it destroyed the ubuntu boot loader\n\n*custom entry in /etc/grub.d/40_custom for windows which doesnt show up\n\n*many update-grub and reboots\n\n*trying windows repair recovery thing\n\n*while being there i also did bootrec.exe /FixBoot\n\n*and update-grub and reboot again\n\n*and finaly because it was so much fun, i installed linux all over again, while formatting and deleting everything linux related before that.\n\nNow that i think of it, Ubuntu also didn't notice Windows being there during the Setup and it still doesnt according to the Boot Info from Boot

Right now it looks like this:\nBoot Priority Order\n 1. ubuntu\n 2. Windows Boot Manager\n 3. USB FDD\n 4. USB HDD\n 5. ATA HDD0 HITACHI [random string]\n\n\nA: My Second Attempt\nIn hindsight I think my previous comments had no value so I removed them. \nYour main problem seems to be that update-grub does not (automatically) find and include your Windows install in the grub.cfg \"menu\" it generates, correct?\n\n\n*\n\n*A suggestion. Consider changing the title of your question to something along the lines of\nWhy does update-grub on UEFI Thinkpad laptop not add Windows to GRUB menu?\nThis might attract the attention of someone who, unlike me, actually knows what is going on when  update-grub probes for operating systems. :-)\n\n\nI'll paraphrase my understanding of your question so that you can correct me where I am wrong.\nI think you have a Lenovo ThinkPad X220 (4291) which uses a UEFI BIOS. \n\n\n*\n\n*Note: 4291 is a guess on my part. What I am trying to refer to is the dddd-xxx code between Type and S/N on this sticker on the bottom of your X220 laptop/tablet.\n\nYour laptop already had Windows 7 installed and working on it. You then installed Ubuntu 12.04 (Beta 2?). However after the install the GRUB menu did not contain an entry to boot Windows 7, correct?\nYou are still able to boot Windows 7 by  entering the BIOS configuration, selecting the Startup menu and then making the Windows entry the first in the Boot sub-menu. But obviously this is a PITA and you would like to have an entry in the GRUB menu you can use to boot Windows.\nI am assuming you installed the Beta 2 copy of Ubuntu 12.04. (64-bit?) If so, now that 12.04 has been released have you used update-manager to apply all updates & fixes? (Just checking.)\nOne of the things you have tried was to add a custom entry for windows to /etc/grub.d/40_custom  but it didn't show up. I assume you based this on the Non-Mac x86_64 UEFI specific info section in the Ubuntu Community Documentation? \nAll I can think of is to suggest trying this once again.\n\n\n*\n\n*Boot Ubuntu, open a terminal window, and run ls -l /etc/grub.d/40_custom to verify that root owns this file and it is executable.\n  -rwxr-xr-x 1 root root 356 Apr 26 14:15 /etc/grub.d/40_custom\n\n*Use sudo gedit /etc/grub.d/40_custom to edit the file. I think the content you want it to have is:  \n\n\n\n    #!/bin/sh\n    exec tail -n +3 $0\n    # This file provides an easy way to add custom menu entries.  Simply type the\n    # menu entries you want to add after this comment.  Be careful not to change\n    # the 'exec tail' line above.\n\n    menuentry \"Windows x86_64 UEFI-GPT\" {\n        search --fs-uuid --no-floppy --set=root 885C-ED1B\n        chainloader (${root})/efi/Boot/bootx64.efi\n    }\n\nSave the file and run sudo update-grub. The edit above should be added to /boot/grub/grub.cfg between the lines ### BEGIN /etc/grub.d/40_custom ### and ### END /etc/grub.d/40_custom ###\nIf the above steps worked, then try rebooting and see if you now have a GRUB menu entry which lets you boot Windows. (Mentally crossing fingers here.)\n\nA: First, you should check for the presence of the Windows boot loader on your ESP. Under Linux, this file will normally be present as /boot/efi/EFI/Microsoft/Boot/bootmgfw.efi. If it's not present, check to see if just that one file is gone, or if all of /boot/efi/EFI/Microsoft is gone. Unfortunately, Ubuntu versions prior to 12.04 would wipe out the ESP, including any pre-existing Windows boot loader and its whole directory tree. If this file is missing, the only way to fix it is to restore it from a backup or use a Windows recovery disc to do the repair. Once that's done, you may need to rejigger things again to get GRUB (or some other boot manager) to launch by default.\nAssuming the Windows boot loader program is present, there are several ways to fix this problem.\nOne is to install rEFIt or rEFInd. I forked rEFInd from rEFIt because rEFIt seems to have been abandoned; thus, IMHO rEFInd is the better solution. These programs are both boot managers that, when properly installed, run before GRUB. They can both auto-detect GRUB and the Windows boot loader, giving you the option to boot either one. Thus, it won't matter if GRUB can't detect Windows or fails to launch it.\nThe second approach is to add an entry to /etc/grub.d/40_custom similar to what irrational John suggests; however, you must change the serial number from 885C-ED1B to whatever it is on your system, or specify the ESP in some other way. Furthermore, you should point the chainloader line at the Windows boot loader, which is /EFI/Microsoft/Boot/bootmgfw.efi. (It might be duplicated at /EFI/Boot/bootx64.efi, but this isn't guaranteed). For instance, this ought to work:\nmenuentry \"Windows\" {\n    set root=(hd0,gpt1)\n    chainloader /EFI/Microsoft/Boot/bootmgfw.efi\n}\n\nThat's from memory, though; it could be I've forgotten something or entered a typo. Also, done in this way, you must specify the ESP correctly on the set root= line; if the ESP isn't the first partition on the first physical disk, you must adjust the numbers appropriately.\n", "Q: \"/usr/lib/cups/filter/pstoufr2cpca failed\" error when trying to print from a Canon MF8030cn I have not been able to get my MF8030cn printer working on ubuntu 12.04. 64bit\nI have Googled for days and tried every tip I could find, including a long thread on the ubuntu forums, but no luck.\nThe error message is /usr/lib/cups/filter/pstoufr2cpca failed\nAny ideas? \n\nA: A native 64-bit driver package is now available!\n\n*\n\n*The only real solution is to install the native 64-bit drivers, but unfortunately Canon only provides 32-bit DEB packages.\n\n\n*After a lot of experimentation and a borrowed Canon MF4350dn all-in-one, I've managed to build the drivers and get them to work.

UbuntuOne for windows has replaced an OpenOffice document with an older version of the file. I am syncing between 2 windows machines and one ubuntu machine. \nFortunately I was able to recover my work from my nightly backup. Is there some kind of log file that might help me figure out what when wrong, or how to avoid this in the future?\n\nA: The main cause of this is when you save a LibreOffice file directly to your Ubuntu One folder. What happens is that LO autosaves every so often, and if that happens while you're uploading a file to U1, then you may actually have three different copies. There really is a conflict so Ubuntu keeps all of them. They're renamed to filename.u1conflict so you can look at their ages and rename them. \nOne \"solution\" is to deactivate autosave in LibreOffice. Another is to save to an unsynced folder and then copy it once in a while. I personally choose the latter though none of the approaches are perfect.  I think we would really need a Ubuntu One extension for LibreOffice for it to really work well. \n\nA: Usually UbuntuOne will backup a copy of your overwritten file with the name [filename].u1conflict, next time it happens you got [filename].u1conflict.[1-n].\nI have no experience with UbuntuOne on Windows, but this is how it works with Ubuntu and Android-clients since some Ubuntu releases back.\nYou can monitor your UbuntuOne using the CLI-command u1stool  (u1stool -h). Maybe if you induce a replication conflict and monitor what happens, you can figure out the problem.\n", "Q: How to edit CD Rip settings in Rhythmbox to improve mp3 quality I'M trying to edit the mp3 rip settings in rhythmbox in order to increase the quality to 320 kbs, but the edit button is locked in Ubuntu 12.04\nhttp://ubuntuone.com/4QqbHZ20RmWWrRZynk2ctZ\nAny help please?\nThanks.-\n\nA: Already reported bug: http://launchpad.net/bugs/945987\n\nA: In the meantime, just use Asunder. sudo apt-get install asunder.

(to see if I could use it as a desktop OS)\n\n*Three days ago, I re-connected the Ubuntu drive, used update-manager -d to go to 12.04 pre-release, and did update-grub to make sure it found the new partition. Also, I switched my default boot HDD to the Ubuntu one. (It continued to default to the Win8 one even after re-connecting the Ubuntu one.)\n\n\nNow, when I boot, I get GRUB, and can boot Ubuntu just fine. GRUB also includes an entry for Windows 8 Loader. This entry will show the Beeta Fish (showing that it is in fact booting Windows 8 or some lower-level part thereof) onscreen and then a message flashes by which is 7 or 8 lines long but I cannot read. Then, my computer starts up again and I see BIOS/POST come up as though I had hit the power button following a successful power off.\nChanging the default boot HDD or using the menu activated by pressing F8 during BIOS/POST to select the proper drive both result in a successful Windows 8 boot.\nHow can I either a) reconfigure GRUB to properly boot Windows (of course, while still booting Ubuntu) or b) configure the Windows bootloader to show up and give me the option of the Ubuntu hard drive (in which case I would turn off the GRUB menu and use the Windows drive as my default).\nUsing another bootloader (for instance, BURG) is okay, so long as you provide simple instructions and the boot-loader is open-source and available by PPA or a .deb file.\n\nA: You can use EasyBCD (freeware) to add Ubuntu to the Windows 8 bootloader. Be sure to add the entry as GRUB2 and not Grub Legacy (the default).\n(Disclosure: I'm the author)\n\nA: It's my understanding you can't boot grub on a windows 8 disk.  Windows 8 has to have a windows MBR.  You can still chainload to the windows 8 loader, but what it sounds like to me is that you installed grub to the win8 HD(you're not allowed to do this).\n\nA: I found your question after posting my own report of the same problem at How to fix insta-crash on dual booting Windows 8 from separate drive.

Ever since Ubuntu 11.10, it has seemingly been impossible to hide Rhythmbox and have it display just a tray icon. Instead, when lowering it, it is still shown in my Window List down the bottom of my screen, which is needlessly taking up space.\nIn the past, when closing the Rhythmbox window, it would disappear from the screen completely, and just show a tray icon in the top right hand corner of my screen, which I could use to show/hide it.\nI'm using Ubuntu 12.04 now, and it has exactly the same problem with this as it did in 11.10. I'm using the Gnome Classic desktop. Rhythmbox is displayed in the sound section of the indicator-applet, but I can't see any way to get it to hide completely.\nIs there any way to replicate the old pre-11.10 behavior where it would display only a tray icon and nothing else?\n\nA: I'm using the Unity desktop and closing it works for me(the X icon not of the _ icon).  It doesn't actually close, it just hides.  If this doesn't work on Gnome3, you should file a bug report.\n\nA: I was on a similar hunt and ended up using this tray icon plugin, which stays visible after closing the Rhythmbox window.  It seems like a recent behavioral change but I can't find a way to toggle the behavior of the X.\n\nA: Canonical decided to remove the sys-tray icon from Rhythmbox because (and I'm paraphrasing here) \"The system tray should not be used as a location to minimize programs\". This causes issues with every distro that isn't Unity, Mendhax has created a plugin that restores this function for you.\nPersonally I think they should have left it in as a plugin but disabled by default so it can easily be restored by those of us who want it but Canonical does what it wants, and they want it completely gone.\n\nA: In Ubuntu 16.04, the Rhythmbox (v3.3) controls are in the sound tray icon so you don't need to install any additional plugins.\n\n\nA: On ubuntu 16.04 gnome 3, that above is not avbl .\n2) For gnome3 users if You ad a favorites panel (best the frippery favorites extension) then add the rhythmbox to favorites When rhythmbox has been closed by normal closing option (cross or via close item on bottom panel if the bottom panel extension has been activated while a song is playing) the song remains playing you can't stop it anymore.

As we know, Ubuntu comes with a lot installed on it. Many of them I either don't know what it does or just don't use. Which applications are safe to uninstall? I use mainly the basic stuff, FireFox, Thunderbird, Empathy, Shotwell, document and photo viewers. I don't think I need something like xDiagnose or xTerm\n\nA: You should use the Synaptic Package Manager or Software Centre to remove the preloaded apps and check you are not removing anything desirable along with the program you do not need. Either program will prompt if anything other than the program in question is to be removed.\ni.e. removing either of  the' xdiagnose' or 'xterm' packages will also remove the 'ubuntu-desktop' package. 'ubuntu-desktop' is a required package if you ever intend to upgrade to a new version of ubuntu, so removing this is not desirable.\n\n\nOn the other hand, if I wanted to remove the 'shotwell' package I can do so without affecting the rest of the system. The same goes for firefox and most of the other built-in apps available from the Dash.\n\nA: Just remove the app unwanted apps from the menu contents. There is menu editor for this. The reason for this is that you're not going to save a massive amount of disk space and when an update of the desktop package is released (happens every now and then) and installed, all your removed applications will return.\n", "Q: How to setup an extetended monitor with Xrandr on my Acer Aspire One?

The codec is a Realtek ALC663.\nWhen I plug in headphones (using the built-in 1/8\" stereo jack), They are detected and the audio level is appropriate but the sound through the headphones is very quiet. Tested with multiple headphones, Jack works fine in Windows.\nAny suggestions?\n\nA: Here's the best solution that I've found:\nOpen terminal and run \nalsamixer\nYou will see the mixer. When you plug the headphones into the laptop note that the \"Speaker\" column becomes \"MM\" (muted). Raise the level in that column and you will hear the normal sound level.\n\nA: Open pavucontrol and set the audio level and close--this should save your settings.\n\nA: Maxym assisted me in finding the correct answer. In his case, the speaker was becoming muted. I had checked for that previously, but he lead me to consider the levels of seemingly unrelated items.\nI eventually  found that my \"Bass Speaker\" was set to 0 by default, but is actually mapped to my headphone jack. The level has no effect through the laptop speakers, but it is actually the headphone volume.\nIt is worth noting that this does not present itself at all in gnome-control-center sound-nua. The only similar setting is \"Subwoofer Level\" and it is always grayed out.\nAfter running alsamixer, changing the volume of \"Bass Speaker\" to 100, then closing alsamixer and opening it again, the level was now properly labeled \"Headphones\", but it still did not appear anywhere in the GTK-based controls.\nI also noticed setting the Master volume has no effect when the headphones are plugged in, except that all sound is muted when the level is decreased to 0.\nSo, should future distraught users stumble across this, check the level of everything in alsamixer; that might work for you too.\n\nA: Same problem on my notebook with Intel HDA - Realtek ALC269VB: Plug in a headphone mutes speakers but very low sound on headphones. In Alsamixer the Speaker slider drops down to zero as soon as headphones are plugged in and it restores the previous volume when headphones are plugged out.

(Nvidia prop driver, non-compositing window manager) I have that problem which seemingly afflicts many using the proprietary Nvidia driver:\n\nVideo tearing: fine horizontal lines (usually near the top of my display) when there is a lot of panning or action in the video.\n\n(Note: switching back to the default nouveau driver is not an option, as its seemingly nonexistent power-management drains my battery several times faster)\nI've tried Totem, Parole, and VLC, and tearing occurs with all of them.  The best result has been to use X11 output in VLC, but there is still tearing with relatively moderate action.\nHardware:  MacBook Air 3,2 -- which has an Nvidia GeForce 320M.  \nThere are two common fixes for tearing with Nvidia prop drivers:\n\n\n*\n\n*Turn off compositing, since Nvidia proprietary drivers don't usually play nice with compositing window managers on Linux (Compiz is an exception I'm aware of).  But I use an extremely lightweight window manager (Awesome window manager) which is not even capable of compositing (or any cool effects).  I also have this problem in Xfce, where I have compositing disabled.\n\n*Enabling sync to VBlank.  To enable this, I set the option in nvidia-settings and then autostart it as nvidia-settings -l with my other autostart programs.  This seems to work, because when I run glxgears, I get:\n$ glxgears\n Running synchronized to the vertical refresh.  The framerate should be\napproximately the same as the monitor refresh rate.\n303 frames in 5.0 seconds = 60.500 FPS\n300 frames in 5.0 seconds = 59.992 FPS\n\nAnd when I check the refresh rate using nvidia-settings:\n$ nvidia-settings -q RefreshRate\nAttribute 'RefreshRate' (wampum:0.0; display device: DFP-2): 60.00 Hz.\n\nAll this suggests sync to VBlank is enabled.  As I understand it, this is precisely designed to stop tearing, and a lot of people's problem is even getting something like glxgears to output the correct info.   I don't understand why it's not working for me.\nxorg.conf: http://paste.ubuntu.com/992056/\nExample of observed tearing:: \n\nA: I too was suffering from video tearing in my Intel sandy bridge processor.

I have found that, especially in non-LTS releases or with beta drivers, this may not work anymore depending on the codec of the video.\n\nA: One thing to try that may work. Open nvidia-settings and go to the powermizer section. Choose \"Maximum Performance\" in the drop-down, and you should see your powermizer level jump to the fastest speed.\nOnce you've done that, try the video.\nIn the past, I've found that vsync doesn't work when the nvidia card is on the slowest powermizer setting.\n\nA: If you are using dual monitors, the nvidia driver can only sync to the vblank of one of the displays unless they use exactly the same refresh rate. And I do mean exactly. This is effectively impossible unless both monitors are the exact same type. In case the nvidia driver is syncing to the wrong display (for example, syncing to the built in display when you want to watch a movie on the external TV) you can override it's choice. From the nvidia driver documentation:\n\nWhen using __GL_SYNC_TO_VBLANK with TwinView, OpenGL can only sync to one of the display devices; this may cause tearing corruption on the display device to which OpenGL is not syncing. You can use the environment variable __GL_SYNC_DISPLAY_DEVICE to specify to which display device OpenGL should sync. You should set this environment variable to the name of a display device; for example \"CRT-1\". Look for the line \"Connected display device(s):\" in your X log file for a list of the display devices present and their names.\n\nI have set this permanently in /etc/environment - just add something like this on a new line:\n__GL_SYNC_DISPLAY_DEVICE=\"DFP-0\"\n\nA: This worked for me on an ATI radeon driver, so it might work for you:\nAdd a configuration file (e.g case /etc/X11/xorg.conf.d/20-nouveau.conf)\nconsisting of this:\nSection \"Device\"\n    Option      \"EXAVsync\"  \"True\"\n    Option      \"GLXVBlank\" \"True\"\n    Identifier  \"Nvidia card\"\n    Driver      \"nouveau\"\nEndSection\n\nEXA is the framework for compositing video; it doesn't seem to vsnc by default.\nIt might also be worth trying different software (e.g. vlc) to playback video.\n\nA: Not sure if this will hepl you, but it worked for me.\nOpen nvidia-settings and change the Frecuency from Auto to 60. \nAnd press apply.\nThis solved my problems with the video tearing and the general desktop flickering.\nSadly I have to do this each time I restart.\n\nA: I was experiencing the very same video tear problems. In my case I observed that tear down happens in fullscreen mode only. The problem seems to be at scaling the video to fullscreen. Whenever the original size of the video played and screen resolution ratios do not match there is tear down in the video. Setting the aspect ratio in smplayer to the displays aspect ratio fixed the problem for me.\ne.g. I was playing a 1280x714 sized video in fullscreen there was tear in the video. As I forced the aspect ratio of the video to 16:9 the playback was smooth.\nI have to note that the root cause of the problem stays there and is annoying. Since the aspect ratio is not kept original, there will be some deformation in the video. However it is better to watch without tears ;)\n\nA: I use Ubuntu 12.04LTS 64bit and I have an nvidia gtx 660ti. \nI was suffering from video tearing for over a month until I found a solution.  \nOpen nvidia x server settings-->PowerMizer-->PowerMizer Settings (near the bottom), and where it says, \"Prefered Mode,\" change the setting from Adaptive to Prefer Maximum Performance.\n\nA: Upgrading to version 319 from PPA solved the problem:\n\n\n*\n\n*https://launchpad.net/~xorg-edgers/+archive/ppa.\n\n\nIf after boot, it runs in failsafe mode go into recovery and run sudo nvidia-xconfig. Happy video playing!\n\nA: If you're not using dual monitor there's another possibility. There are two different kinds of sync to vblank: One for XVideo and one for OpenGL. In nvidia-settings, one is under \"X Server XVideo Settings\" and the other is under \"OpenGL/Settings\". Which one actually affects your video playback software may depend on which output plugin it is using.\n\nA: I am unsure from your description whether you are actually seeing tearing; normally, tearing looks like the picture is split horizontally into two or three sections, with the parts not matching up. This happens because the top part of the picture and the bottom part are not coming from the same frame in the video. Wikipedia has a good simulated example of screen tearing. Fine horizontal lines sounds different, more like combing artifacts from poor de-interlacing, although maybe it is just hard to describe.\nYou don't mention any details of the video you are trying to watch, such as its resolution, encoding, and if it is interlaced or progressive, and whether you have de-interlacing turned on in VLC. It might also be worth checking if the video processing is being offloaded to the GPU, or whether the CPU is doing all the work. Have you confirmed that you can successfully view the same video on different hardware, or on the MacBook using OS X?\nYou say you've tried with compositing disabled on XFCE, but it probably wouldn't hurt to try adding:\nSection \"Extensions\"\n    Option \"Composite\" \"Disable\"\nEndSection\n\nto your /etc/X11/xorg.conf just to be sure. Also, one other suggestion not mentioned so far is to add:\nOption \"UseEvents\" \"True\"\n\nto the Device or Screen sections of your xorg.conf.\nUPDATE:\nThe attached screenshot definitely shows tearing! If the player is otherwise keeping up with decoding the video (ie, no stuttering slow downs, just the tearing), then it probably doesn't matter if it's the CPU or GPU doing the decoding. VLC has an option on the Video settings page in Preferences to turn on and off \"Accelerated video output\"; if it's on, it ought to be using the GPU to decode. If you toggle that setting in VLC and run top in a terminal whilst playing the video, you should see a difference in CPU usage between the two settings. You could also try turning off any de-interlacing in VLC to see if that makes a difference.\nI have two other suggestions:\nI don't see anything obviously wrong with your xorg.conf, but you could double-check that both sync to vblank settings (on X Server XVideo Settings and OpenGL Settings) are stored correctly in .nvidia-settings-rc. Some people run nvidia-settings as root or using gksudo (so it can update /etc/X11/xorg.conf), but this can result in the settings being stored in /root/.nvidia-settings-rc rather than ~/.nvidia-settings-rc. It ought to be picking up your own copy, but to avoid any doubt, you should check both vblank settings when running nvidia-settings as you; don't forget to hit \"Save Current Configuration\" on the bottom page of settings. If you run:\nnvidia-settings -q=XVideoTextureSyncToVBlank -q=SyncToVBlank\n\nthen you should see both settings are set to 1. You should probably also check that however you auto-loading the settings is working by rebooting and running the above command again.\nThe other thing you could try would be to upgrade/downgrade your nvidia drivers. I have experienced tearing with some minor driver version updates before; there are definitely \"good\" and \"bad\" versions of the nvidia drivers and the latest are not always the best. You can try upgrading using the X-swat PPA:\nhttps://launchpad.net/~ubuntu-x-swat/+archive/x-updates\nAnd you can try downgrading to an earlier version available for 12.04:\nhttps://launchpad.net/ubuntu/precise/amd64/nvidia-current\nor\nhttps://launchpad.net/ubuntu/precise/i386/nvidia-current\ndepending on whether you have amd64 or i386 installed. Click on the version number to the right that you want to try, download the .deb file and then install with:\nsudo dpkg --install <name of file>.deb\n\nFor example, due to an unrelated nvidia bug, I had to download this:\nhttp://launchpadlibrarian.net/90395807/nvidia-current_290.10-0ubuntu2_amd64.deb\nfrom\nhttps://launchpad.net/ubuntu/precise/amd64/nvidia-current/290.10-0ubuntu2\nand installed it using:\nsudo dpkg --install nvidia-current_290.10-0ubuntu2_amd64.deb\n\nOne other tiny point: one other answer mentions changing the refresh rate from Auto to 60Hz, and you say that it is already set to 60Hz. However, your attached xorg.conf has nvidia-auto-select in metamodes (in the Screen section), which suggests it is not fixed. However, your Monitor definition only offers 60.0, so maybe this is inconsequential. It might be interesting to back up and move your xorg.conf, and re-run nvidia-xconfig and nvidia-settings to see if you get a different config.\n\nA: In addition to David previous post: if you want to install latest NVidia proprietary drivers using X-swat PPA, you can also add it to your apt sources:\nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:ubuntu-x-swat/x-updates\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get install nvidia-current\n\nThis will install latest version and keep you up to date regarding their deliveries.\n\nA: Sorry this answer is somewhat for openSuSE, not Ubuntu, but I did finally get it working with these changes,\n\n\n*\n\n*Disable compositing / window effects temporarily (alt+shift+f12 in openSuSE)\n\n*Use VLC with the \"Video\" setting set to \"OpenGL video output (experimental)\". \"Accelerated video output (Overlay)\" is also checked for me. I'm using VLC 2.1.1 if it matters.\n\n*Set the PowerMizer settings to performance, as in mjnichol's answer\n\n*Set the OpenGL settings to high, as in Amir Dizdarević's answer\n\n\nHope it helps! I imagine there's some setting to make it work with compositing, but I recommend at least disabling compositing for testing. My setup is a 4K monitor and GTX 650 graphics card.\n\nA: You can fix this for VLC by changing video output to \"OpenGL GLX\".\n\nA: I am running 64-bit Elementary OS Luna (based on Ubuntu 12.04 LTS) and I had the same problem. Searching around, I finally found a method that WORKS and obviously it does include the \"Powermizer settings to Performance\" solution, as a lot of other peaople have already said.\nThe problem is that after restart these settings get restored to the default \"Auto\" setting and apparently the Nvidia-Settings application does not save properly the new settings of Powermizer. NOT TO WORRY!!!\nJUST FOLLOW THE INSTRUCTIONS BELOW, IT'S SOOOOO SIMPLE:\nhttp://ubuntu.aspcode.net/view/635400140124705175636416/nvidia-settings-powermizer-performance-mode-on-12044-64-bit\nAs the article says, make a Startup Application and you're good to go!!!! TRUST ME IT WORKS!!! Many thanks to Aquablue for posting this and of course, to Mike from Nvidia Customer Care who provided the solution!!!\nFYI, I have a Phenom II X4, 8GB DDR3 RAM, Corsair SSD, GTX 650, Elementary Luna 64-bit.\n\nA: I could pick the window with my cursor, move the window, and it fixed the tearing. So is seems like some callback issues in X.\nFor me the vlc fix was:\nvlc -> tools -> preferences -> video -> in the 'output' dropdown choose\nx11 video output(XCB)\n\nA: It seems that you are running some lightweight window manager (presumably openbox). If that is the case, it is possible that you are using xcompmgr as a composite manager to get desktop effects such as shadows, transparencies, etc.\nIn my case, turning xcompmgr off solved this same issue: tearing while watching videos, specially those in HD (which are CPU intensive). Apparently, tearing occured because of a bug in xcompmgr, which is a longly abandoned project.\nTo turn off xcompmgr you can execute \"killall xcompmgr\". That should work.\nHope it helps! \nSaludos!

I've been curious if there is a way to make it so that the Update Manager can check for updates say every few hours rather than daily. Now, I know that I can run sudo apt-get update to check, but it would be nice to have it show it to me more often...I love having the most up to date system that I can.\n\nA: I use two scripts, one that runs in the background whenever I am logged in, and one that is allowed through sudo without a password to apt-get update and additionally download packages.\nYou can download the two scripts I wrote here, or copy and paste them into gedit from below:\nhttp://ubuntuone.com/0tNctmQnF2peAsUmaqtyo3\nThese are the two scripts I wrote:\nThe first should be called 'background-runner':\n#! /bin/bash\n\n# This will connect and download any new packages every two hours.\n# Ideal for use on the development release to save time.\n# Downloads almost all packages, not just security releases.\nsleep 10m\n\nwhile true; do\n    sudo /usr/local/bin/package-downloader update\n    sleep 120m\ndone\n\nAnd the second should be called 'package-downloader': \n#! /bin/bash\n# This runs as root and is allowed through sudo to only download packages.\n\nif [ $1 = 'update' ]; then\n    apt-get update\nfi\n\nif [ $1 = 'download' ]; then\n    apt-get update\n    apt-get --yes --download-only upgrade\nfi\n\nTo set this up, download or copy and paste the files into gedit and save the files with the names noted above. cd to their location in the terminal and run the following commands:\nsudo cp package-downloader background-runner /usr/local/bin\nsudo chmod +x /usr/local/bin/package-downloader /usr/local/bin/background-runner\n\nNow we have to allow the package-downloader script through sudo.\nOpen a terminal and type\nsudo visudo\n\nat the bottom of the file add the following line replacing MYUSER with the username you run as, and then hit ctrl+x and then enter to save.\n MYUSER ALL=(root) NOPASSWD: /usr/local/bin/package-downloader\n\nNow navigate to 'Startup Applications.' Click add.  Name it whatever you like, and enter /usr/local/bin/background-runner for the command.

You might want to disable the automatic check for updates through the Update Manager's Software Sources dialogue, which you can reach by clicking settings in the bottom left corner. This way update-manager will not check for updates when the script is already doing so more frequently.\n\nThe scripts linked here will just do apt-get update by default.

Im not that technical when it comes to dealing with Operating systems\n\nA: You do not have to uninstall 10.04 in order to upgrade it to 12.04.\nFirstly, you can upgrade your Ubuntu directly using Upgrade manager (as 10.04 and 12.04 are both LTS (long-term support) releases, there's a direct upgrade path, despite 10.04 not being \"Ubuntu minus 1\"). This will allow you to keep your installed applications and settings:\n\n\n*\n\n*How do I upgrade to a newer version of Ubuntu?\nIf you prefer to do a clean re-install, you will need to prepare a bootable Ubuntu 12.04 CD or flash USB drive, back up all your data, boot from the CD and install 12.04 onto the same partition where 10.04 currently resides.

With certain Windows fonts there is a display issue where ligature-kerning seems to flip out and make the two letters bold. Here's a screenshot of an email using Helvetica in Firefox:\n\nAs you can see, it seems to be something about the way crossed characters (t and f) connect to each other and letters like i.\nI've had this problem for a very long time (over multiple systems) and wondered if anybody has ever seen similar issues popping up and found a way to fix them.\nNote: I think this does just affect Firefox. Chrome and LibreOffice are both fine. \n\nA: lgarzo's answer will work only on websites that have a \"noligs\" class on the text (most websites don't). \nTo globally disable ligatures on all websites, add the following line to your userChrome.css:\n* { -moz-font-feature-settings: \"liga\" 0; }\n\nThe easiest way to do that is to create a new style with the Stylish extension.\n\nA: A few remarks popped into my mind while looking at the image:\n\n\n*\n\n*The ligatures seem to be anti-aliased, while the rest of the text is not. Therefore it looks fatter than normal text (although I cannot deny it also looks bold). \n\n*AFAIK the Helvetica font is a non-standard font, i.e. does not come with default Windows installations. Do you have it installed, or is it a different font?\n\n\nI think the problem is based on the font not supporting ligatures/kerning correctly.\nYou can disable ligatures in FF with the CSS rule below:\n/* disable common ligatures, usually on by default */\n.noligs { -moz-font-feature-settings: \"liga\" 0; }\n\nSource: CSS Reference:Mozilla Extensions\n\nA: Another solution that will work with all applications, including Libre Office, is given by aldeby:\nEdit or create the file ~/.fonts.conf and paste this code in it:\n<match target=\"font\" >\n<edit name=\"embeddedbitmap\" mode=\"assign\">\n<bool>false</bool>\n</edit>\n</match>\n\nMake sure to keep the XML structure.\nLog out and in again, and Calibri (and possibly some other fonts) will look much better (actually even better than with the other answers given here, because the ugly bitmap substitutions are completely disabled).\n\nA: In addition to Calimo's answer, Archlinux users can find help https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/font_configuration - Disable bitmap fonts\nIt was suggested to created a local config file in ~/.config/fontconfig/conf.d/20-no-embedded.conf, but I went for a system wide option by putting the config in /etc/fonts/conf.d/20-no-embedded.conf.\n<?xml version=\"1.0\"?>\n<!DOCTYPE fontconfig SYSTEM \"fonts.dtd\">\n<fontconfig>\n  <match target=\"font\">\n    <edit name=\"embeddedbitmap\" mode=\"assign\">\n      <bool>false</bool>\n    </edit>\n  </match>\n</fontconfig>\n\nThen just restart the app (in my case thunderbird).\n\nA: Disabling ligatures (see Calimo's fonts.conf answer) is the wrong direction! It may remove those over-aliased \"bold\" ligatures in fonts like Calibri, but it also removes some of the beauty of typography.  That's rather similar to shrinking the font until you can't tell the difference.\nI solved this for my system by removing the Calibri font, installing Carlito, which is \"metric-compatible with Calibri\" and is packaged with \"a mapping entry to fontconfig (local.conf),\" and refreshing my font cache:\n$ rm ~/.fonts/microsoft/CALIBRI*\n$ sudo apt install fonts-crosextra-carlito\n$ fc-cache\n\nYou can then verify that Carlito stands in for Calibri:\n$ fc-match Calibri\nCarlito-Regular.ttf: \"Carlito\" \"Regular\"\n\n(If this doesn't work, you may need something like sudo rm /usr/share/fonts/truetype/msttcorefonts/calibri* though the case and exact location may differ.)\nBefore removing Microsoft's Calibri, I saved a test document in LibreOffice that used Calibri and took a screen shot.  After doing that, I quit LibreOffice, opened it again, and then loaded my test document.  The \"Calibri\" font name was italicized to indicate that it was substituted for.  I took a screen shot of this substituted version and pasted it below the original:\n\nThe above text is a pair of screen shots of 13pt Calibri, with Microsoft's Calibri above Carlito as matched by fontconfig.  There is no bold, no formatting, \"pair kerning\" enabled, as rendered by LibreOffice 5.0.5.1.\nCarlito is quite close to Calibri, ligatures render properly, and it's much prettier overall.\nYou can do the same with Caladea for Cambria with fonts-crosextra-caladea and you can use Google's Croscore fonts Arimo, Tinos, and Cousine for Arial, Times New Roman, and Courier New with fonts-croscore.  Learn more at Debian's Substituting Calibri and Cambria Fonts wiki.\nBut what about Helvetica?\nThis question asks about the Helvetica font, which is Apple's preferred sans-serif font.  Microsoft preferred Arial before it changed to Calibri.  The default Linux mapping varies by distribution, but it's typically either Nimbus Sans L or else Liberation Sans, e.g.\n$ fc-match Helvetica\nn019003l.pfb: \"Nimbus Sans L\" \"Regular\"\n\nIf you run that and get Arial, that's a pretty good reason for having the ligature issue described above – Arial is not a great font.\nHelvetica has quite the culture surrounding it and I can't find a font that is fully metric-compatible with Helvetica.  Arial (and fonts metrically compatible with Arial, including Liberation Sans and its fork, Arimo, have identical character widths (which mean they're \"mostly\" metric compatible; text will wrap the same way as with Helvetica). Among the free fonts, Liberation Sans and Nimbus Sans seem to have the most similar aesthetics.\nThere's also IBM Plex, a new font with big money behind it[1][2]. Plex is designed to replace Helvetica (it also has condensed sans as well as serif and monospace fonts) in all of IBM's materials, though it is not at all metric-compatible to Helvetica or other fonts.  Font Squirrel has a nice view of samples of the Plex fonts.\nFontconfig aliases\nTo manually alias Helvetica to another font (and therefore not need to remove Calibri and/or Arial, though in that case you should also manually alias those), edit your ~/.config/fontconfig/fonts.conf file (for older systems, that's ~/.fonts.conf. To avoid confusion, I symlink the latter to the former) as noted in this answer, adding a new <alias> section for Helvetica (this one uses Arimo. Make sure you have it installed):\n<?xml version='1.0'?>\n<!DOCTYPE fontconfig SYSTEM 'fonts.dtd'>\n<fontconfig>\n\n  <alias>\n    <family>Helvetica</family>\n    <prefer><family>Arimo</family></prefer>\n  </alias>\n\n</fontconfig>\n\n\nA: The solution by https://askubuntu.com/a/186940/676490 with a valid xml-structure:\n<?xml version='1.0'?>\n<!DOCTYPE fontconfig SYSTEM 'fonts.dtd'>\n<fontconfig>\n <match target=\"font\" >\n  <edit name=\"embeddedbitmap\" mode=\"assign\">\n   <bool>false</bool>\n  </edit>\n  <edit name=\"fontfeatures\" mode=\"append\">\n   <string>calt off</string>\n   <string>clig off</string>\n   <string>dlig off</string>\n   <string>liga off</string>\n  </edit>\n </match>\n <alias>\n  <family>Helvetica</family>\n  <prefer><family>Arimo</family></prefer>\n </alias>\n <alias>\n  <family>Calibri</family>\n  <prefer><family>Carlito</family></prefer>\n </alias>\n</fontconfig>\n\nand save this file under ~/.fonts.conf\n", "Q: A program has too many menu entries.

In program whenever I am accessing a folder which requires root privilege then it asks password at terminal but I want to display the dialog to user to enter the password and authenticate him. How to call that dialog and authenticate the user in ubuntu?\n\nA: There are two different Q&As at stackoverflow answering your question: here and here.\nBoth answers use the command gksudo (already mentioned by @khamer). If you run gksudo command (also without python) it will basically do what sudo does, but with a graphical interface - i.e. ask the user for a password and then run the command as root if the user is in the sudoers file.\nTo implement the suggested solution from the linked answers in python, you can use something as shown by the following example:\nCreate a file run.py:\n#!/usr/bin/python\n\nimport subprocess\nsubprocess.call(['gksudo','python create.py'])\n\nAnd a file create.py:\n#!/usr/bin/python\n\n# Create test file..\nf = file(\"mytestfile\", \"w\")\n\nThen run python run.py and after you enter your password a file owned by root will be created. If you run python create.py it will be owned by you (the file should not exist before running the script).\n\nA: While I'm sure there's a fancier python solution, the down and dirty version is to use gksudo. gksudo does the same thing sudo does, except it creates that dialog for authentication you mentioned instead of asking on the command line.\nSee https://help.ubuntu.com/community/RootSudo#Graphical_sudo\n\nA: Insert this script in your code:    \nimport os\n\nPassword = raw_input('Please enter your root password!')\n\nsudo_command = '<your command>'\n\nexecute = os.system('echo %s|sudo -S %s' % (Password, sudo_command))\n\n", "Q: Sum over unique tags in a range Suppose I have a spreadsheet in which I track my fruit purchases.

Thanks to the kind soul who created a gnumeric tag and retagged!)\n\nA: In general\nIn general, this would be a typical task for a pivot table. Starting with the database table shown below, you would define a pivot table to sum the distinct items as follows:\n\nThis will give you the following result table:\n\nUsing Gnumeric\nSadly, Gnumeric doesn't support pivot tables yet - so i used LibreOffice to create the screenshots above.\nWith gnumeric, you could use the DSUM function instead. It will sum the amounts for a given item, but it has the disadvantage that it won't calculate the sums for all items automatically; instead, you'll have to insert DSUM functions (and criteria tables) for every distinct item. So, it's quite cumbersome to use this functionality. Here's an example for a gnumeric sheet using the DSUM function:\n\nCell F2 holds the formula =dsum(A2:C6;3;A9:C10): A2:C6 is the database (on the screenshot: in light green), 3 is the column to sum up (\"Amount\"), and A9:C10 is the criteria table (light cyan), selecting only rows with item \"Apple\".\nCorrespondingly, F3 has =dsum(A2:C6;3;A13:C14): almost the same, only the second criteria table instead of the first.\n", "Q: Why is Ubuntu named Ubuntu? I have long been interested in something. I know a lot of things about the history of Ubuntu, but I do not know about the name. \nSo, why is Ubuntu named \"Ubuntu\"?\n\nA: From About the Name, viewed with the Wayback Machine:\n\nUbuntu is a South African ethical ideology focusing on people's\n  allegiances and relations with each other.

According to https://wiki.ubuntu.com/PrecisePangolin/ReleaseNotes/UbuntuDesktop \"Python 2.6 is no longer available for install\".\nI need to support legacy software that runs only on Python 2.6. How can I install Python 2.6 on Ubuntu 12.04?\n\nA: I'm using a PPA:\nhttps://launchpad.net/~fkrull/+archive/deadsnakes\nInstall the PPA:\nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:fkrull/deadsnakes\nRun Update:\nsudo apt-get update\nInstall your flavor:\nsudo apt-get install python2.6 python2.6-dev\n\nA: I looked for a PPA, didn't find any, then installed Python 2.6 packages from 11.10 by hand:\ncd /tmp\nwget http://XX.archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/pool/main/p/python2.6/python2.6_2.6.7-4ubuntu1_i386.deb\nwget http://XX.archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/pool/main/p/python2.6/python2.6-minimal_2.6.7-4ubuntu1_i386.deb\nwget http://XX.archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/pool/main/p/python2.6/python2.6-dev_2.6.7-4ubuntu1_i386.deb\nwget http://XX.archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/pool/main/p/python2.6/python2.6-dbg_2.6.7-4ubuntu1_i386.deb\nwget http://XX.archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/pool/main/p/python2.6/libpython2.6_2.6.7-4ubuntu1_i386.deb\ndpkg -i *python2.6*_2.6.7-4ubuntu1_i386.deb\n\nReplace XX with your country code, and, if necessary, i386 with your architecture (amd64 for 64-bit installs).\n(Also, most people don't need the -dbg package.)\n\nA: Check out pythonbrew. It does a great job of managing multiple python versions and enviroments. It builds each version of python from source, but does so in a user friendly way. After you install it just run:\npythonbrew install 2.6\npythonbrew switch 2.6\n\nThen you can use it with virtualenv to create a virtual enviroment with whatever frameworks and libraries you need without having to worry about conflicts.\n\nA: Python isn't too hard to build. Try sudo apt-get install build-essential, sudo apt-get build-dep python2.7 (only gets dependencies which are almost the same as those for Python 2.6. Now download the Python 2.6 source distribution and ./configure, make, make install.\n\nA: for plone development on linux, we use this buildout script:\nhttps://svn.plone.org/svn/collective/buildout/bda-naked-python/\nthere are buildout configuration files for python versions 2.4, 2.5, 2.6, 2.7 and 3.2.\nthe README tells how to use it.\n\nA: If you are upgrading to 12.04 and already have Python 2.6 installed, it will remain installed after your upgrade.\nThe packages installed will be considered \"local\", and obviously cannot be updated with the Upgrade Manager. Source-only security fixes (if any are needed) are available from python.org.\nOnly those 2.6 packages that are installed will remain, any that were not installed will not be accessible. If you need them, you can get them from the Ubuntu archives following Marius' instructions.\n\nA: Try using the debs here (check the description dependencies as you may have a lot to download--but its all point/click debs).\nOr if you got a usb with 10.04  install with software centre and make an aptoncd iso.  You can open these and simply click the debs backed up within without doing a full auto install.  I'm making a few to back-up the 10.04 debs as i fear they will be gone one day and 10.04 the best version in ubuntu history to date.\n\nA: i dont know is it work or not, but you can try this:\napt-cache show python\n\nthis will show you version of the package and then try:\napt-get install packag_name=version\n\nfor getting only the available versions try this:\napt-cache policy <package_name>\n\nmake us know is it work or not...\n", "Q: How do I type [ and \\ with a Mac keyboard?

Is there a workaround?\n\nA: In case you are having this issue and it's not the 18.04.1 problem or and switching to lts or non-lts updates changes nothing, try the following (super hard to find steps).\nOpen a terminal and type: export DEBUG_UPDATE_MANAGER=true before the do-release-upgrade -c command to see what goes wrong.\nIf you are getting the same problem I have you would see:\nresult of meta-release download: '<urlopen error timed out>'\nNO self.metarelease_information\nNo new release found.\n\nYou could be facing the issue that you have a proxy configured for apt that is no longer relevant. Because of historic reasons (bug #446552), there are several unreasonable places where the updater will look for proxy settings. Beside the system-wide settings you should also check bash environment variables, gconf gnome proxy settings, /etc/apt/apt.conf and in my case /root/.synaptic/synaptic.conf.\nThe latter mind you no longer has a working menu in the GUI and the only way to remove the proxy settings is to edit the file.

It is recommended that most LTS users wait until then before upgrading to 14.04.\n\nIf you choose to upgrade before then, you can pass the -d option to the upgrade tool, running do-release-upgrade -d or update-manager -d, to upgrade from vanilla 12.04 to 14.04. (-d stands for devel.)\nThis question explains the justification for waiting for the prompt:\n\n\n*\n\n*Upgrading LTS to LTS (server) -- why wait for the first point release?\n\nA: sudo do-release-upgrade -d \n\nNotice the -d at the end; from the man page:\n  -d, --devel-release\n      If using the latest supported release, upgrade to the development release\n\nThis works even with Prompt=lts in /etc/update-manager/release-upgrades.\n\nA: If one has no access to a GUI and wants the update on terminal:\n\n\n*\n\n*Edit the file\n/etc/update-manager/release-upgrades\n\nfor Prompt to match either normal or lts.

The upgrader will attempt to upgrade to the first LTS release available after the\n  currently-running one.

I'm running Ubuntu 12.04\n\nA: In lightdm's upstart job (/etc/init/lightdm.conf), add a mounted event so it looks a bit like this:\nstart on ((filesystem\n           and runlevel [!06]\n           and started dbus\n           and (drm-device-added card0 PRIMARY_DEVICE_FOR_DISPLAY=1\n                or stopped udev-fallback-graphics))\n           and mounted MOUNTPOINT=/home\n          or runlevel PREVLEVEL=S)\n\n\nA: I was experiencing a similar problem after upgrading to 12.04 and solved it by adding the nfsvers=3 option to the fstab entry for the NFS mount. The NFS filesystem was being exported using version 3 and there appears to be a problem in Ubuntu 12.04 and 11.10 with detecting that since version 4 is tried first. See the following bug report:\nhttps://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/nfs-utils/+bug/891825\n", "Q: How are separate x screens supposed to work (probable problem) I just recently re-installed Ubuntu (went from 11.10 32bit to 11.10 64bit) and got a new monitor and video card (nvidia, vga and hdmi outputs). So, since I have two monitors connected to the computer, I decided to try the different multi-view setups (TwinView and separate x screens). TwinView works fine, but isn't what I want to use right now. However, when trying to setup separate x screens (from nvidia-settings), when I logout/login it does set it up, but the following problems occurr: \n\n\n*\n\n*When I login, the second display (display/monitor 1) shows the\ndesktop for a split second and then goes completely white. I did\nsome research and found that this is caused by nautilus, which, if\nkilled, shows the desktop in the second display again (which it\ndoes, but the white screen comes back as soon as I open up another\nprogram [such as nautilus or gedit], also there is no toolbar in the\nsecond screen).\n\n*The second screen seems to be almost completely non-interactive.\nI say almost as there are two things I can do (though not very\nhelpful): if I right-click it gets rid of the white background, but\ndoes not bring up a menu (nor do further right-clicks accomplish\nanything). Also, if I force a program to open in the second screen\n(via opening a terminal and running a command in the first screen,\nsuch as gedit --display :0.1) I can do nothing with the program\n(not even type, as that just puts characters in the terminal in the\nfirst screen), save for clicking on the buttons that are in the GUI.\n\n*The mouse cursor is an x in the second screen (and sometimes in\nthe first screen if I try to do too much interaction with the second\nscreen). Which isn't that bad, but it seems kind of weird.\n\n*If I lock my screen (via ctrl + alt + L) or if the screen times out\nand locks itself, if I try to get back in, the screens come on but\nremain completely blank.\nSo I was wondering, is this how separate x screens are supposed to work (sort of a stupid question I guess)? I'm guessing not, but, since I don't know how they are supposed to work, I can't really tell when they are working correctly.\nIf they are functioning improperly, does anyone know of a way to fix it (as I would like separate x screens far more than TwinView at the moment [if they work the way I think they do])? Thanks!\n\nA: I've got the same problem! Just installed Ubuntu 12.04 onto an old Acer Travelmate with Nvidia graphics, and same problem.\nAfter reading what you said about Nautilus, tried loading a few diferent window managers.  Follow this link to find out how:\nhttp://ramannanda.blogspot.com.au/2009/06/changing-window-manager-in-ubuntu.html\n(Tried Gnome, Unity 2D, and lxde - all flicked the wallpaper up, then went white like yours).\nHowever xfce worked!  I think I did this:\nsudo apt-get install xfce4\n\nXfce fixed it, and works a treat!\nI really like the way xfce is uncluttered - it takes 1/2 hour to get your head around it, but is well worth it.\nSee: http://docs.xfce.org/xfce/getting-started\nDifferent windows being run on each monitor, can independently set the backgrounds on each monitor! :-)  They each have their own workspace too.

My download matches your size and the md5 has from the site as well.\n\nA: So, firstly, sorry for the confusion here.  Fundamentally it came down to a communication glitch between the release team and our sysadmins.\nAround release time, we push many of our images out to Amazon's CloudFront service to keep our bandwidth use under control.  releases.ubuntu.com is managed directly by the release team, but the images on CloudFront are pushed by our sysadmins, and we have to push there well in advance to make sure everything's in place.  The sysadmins pushed the most recent daily build at the time, but after that we had to respin images for some serious bugs, and we forgot to let the sysadmins know about this so that they could update CloudFront.  As a result, you were getting out-of-date versions.\nWe've pushed updated images to CloudFront now, and all should be well, although I'm going to check things over manually just to make sure.\n\nA: I had the same thing happen with Ubuntu 12.04 and Lubuntu 12:04, both downloaded via Torrents.\nFirst time it has ever happened to me. I had already decided to just delete the file and download again, but I had to step away from the computer for a while. When I came back, Transmission reported a corrupted section. I deleted, downloaded again, MD5SUM matched, installed. The weird thing is that it happened twice the same day, with different files. Perhaps there's something wrong with my network or something.\n\nA: Your initial download was incomplete or corrupted.  BitTorrent verifies the downloaded data to make sure it is correct, which you have verified with md5sum.  The size difference is just the Megabyte vs. Mebibyte issue.\n", "Q: how to read files recovored by scalpel? I used scalpel to recover some deleted jpg files.

I wanted to set environment variables JAVA_HOME and PATH. So I wanted to open ~/.pam_environment since it is the best place to set environment variables relevant to a particular user according to the link https://help.ubuntu.com/community/EnvironmentVariables.\nThe link states:\n\nSession-wide environment variables\nEnvironment variable settings that should affect just a particular user (rather then the >system as a whole) should be set into:\n~/.pam_environment - This file is specifically meant for setting a user's \nenvironment. It is not a script file, but rather consists of assignment expressions, one per line.\n\nThe problem I have is that I am not able to open the file ~/.pam_environment by using the command gedit ~/.pam_environment.\nI do not know whether this is the right way to open this file, please point me in the right direction.\n\nA: Note that .pam_environment does not use the normal syntax. You should strictly follow the pam_env.conf syntax.\nIn particular if you want to set the JAVA_HOME and PATH variables you can put this content into your .pam_environment:\nJAVA_HOME DEFAULT=<the-path-to-java-home\nPATH DEFAULT=${PATH}:extend/the:path\n\nFollowing Rinzwind answer will most likely brick your login[1]. In which case you can re login into a TTY  using Ctrl + Alt + F1 and remove the .pam_environment file with the command:\n/bin/rm ~/.pam_environment\n\n\n[1] At least on my computer with Kubuntu 12.04\n\nA: I was having a similar issue with this. Specifically the concept of locating, or otherwise creating, the .pam_environment file. \nThis is the route I followed, courtesy of Deepu Mohan Puthrote's blog post (Link below):\nStep One: In your GUI (Graphical User Interface) Locate the file in your 'home' directory called '.pam_environment.' NOTE: Pam_environment is a hidden file, to make it and other files/directories visible press 'Ctrl+H.' If pam_environment does not exist, continue to step two. If pam_environment does exists, skip to step three.\nStep Two: This is how you create your pam_environment file. Open your CLI (bash, terminal, or whatever you want to call it) and make sure you are in your home directory (I.e /home/yourname), you can do this with the 'pwd' (print working directory) command. If you are not in your home directory, input 'cd' to revert to your home directory. \nNow create the file in question with the following command:\ntouch ~/.pam_environment\nStep Three: In your GUI, open '.pam_environment' in your home directory (remember to make hidden files visible if necessary). When opened, you can input the the commands into the text editor which will create your session wide environment. \nFor 'PATH' (which I was learning to set) I used something like:\nPATH=$PATH:~/usr/sbin:/usr/bin/<----add your directory here ---->\nStep Four: Now restart your computer and, if your computer is as old as mine, go make a cup of tea. \nNow check that your change has worked. Open your CLI and run the command 'printenv PATH.' Unless I have failed you, you have just successfully created a session wide PATH variable; you should see the PATH variable, or a variant of, displayed on screen with the new value you have defined in your .pam_environment file.\nFor reference: http://tech.deepumohan.com/2012/12/how-to-set-environment-variable-in.html\n", "Q: How to add 100GB from Windows 7 to Ubuntu?

Has anyone found the secrets to installing and running Lord of the Rings Online on an Ubuntu 11.10 64Bit system?\n\nA: From http://www.lotrolinux.com/ \n\nThe actual game works very well under wine, with just a few adjustments needed to wine's registry and the games UserPreferences.ini file. Details of these adjustments can be found at the wine AppDB page for the Lord of the Rings Online or the How-To on this site.\n\nImportant section from the 2nd link:\nRequirements\n\n\n*\n\n*A PC with at least the minimum system specs for the game.\n\n*Wine or CrossOver Games.\n\n\nCaveats\nYou'll need to install the Mozilla engine in Wine to get Help/Lorebook and Turbine Store links to work. If your client crashes or shows a black page when accessing the store, you're missing the Mozilla web browsing engine in Wine\nIf you run Linux and you run Beryl/Compiz (or some other 3D Desktop Effects software), disable them before launching LOTRO. The game will run normally, although with somewhat degraded performance. However, many hotkey functions and mouse gestures used in the game will also activate 3D Desktop effects, and could cause the game to crash.\nIf you get odd texture tiling on the ground, disable Anisotropic texture filtering in the LotRO Advanced Graphics settings.\nDownload\nA client can be downloaded from this link.\nNote that it is strongly recommended that you use the standard Turbine Client download (Pando Media Booster, PMB) when installing under WINE 1.3.9 or later. Using Wine versions LOWER than 1.3.9 is NOT recommended.\nInstalling LOTRO\nInstall LOTRO. DO NOT USE THE MOM DVD FOR THIS! Install a downloaded version. Patching from the MOM [Mines of Moria] DVD will take as long, if not longer than downloading the current installer and patching it. Also, it is no longer possible to \"patch-up\" from the SOA [Shadows of Angmar] DVD. Download and install PyLOTRO by following the instructions from the PyLOTRO download page.\nConfigure the PyLOTRO launcher. The settings should be adjusted to fit your system:\n\nApplication      Wine\nWINEDEBUG        fixme-all\nWINEPREFIX       /home/your-username/.wine\nGame Directory   /home/your-username/.wine/drive_c/Program Files/Turbine/The Lord of the Rings Online\nHi-Res Graphics  Enabled (or Disabled if you downloaded standard res LOTRO) \n\nRunning LOTRO\nThe first time you run LOTRO it will fail, because it's missing its config files. During the crash it will create them however. From then on it will work fine. If you use the GUI launcher please remember to patch when needed (Tools->Patch->Apply, close when done).\n\nA: This question seems outdated however since OP specifically mentions Ubuntu 64-bit I suspect it may concern both older and current (13.04) versions of Ubuntu, specifically the 64-bit edition which does not contain the same packages. It is very hard to find the answer, with nearly all advice/tutorials online coming from users of a 32 bit Linux OS.\nThe Problem\nAll the guides I found simply mention installing pylotro, and otherwise focus on WineHQ settings. Installation is simply a matter of downloading LOTRO (you can probably download it via Steam under Wine), and creating a Wine prefix to run the installer.\nHowever on Ubuntu 13.04 64-bit (and possibly older 64 bit versions of Ubuntu), the main issue is that you simply can't launch the game with pylotro:\n[E08] Server not found - may be down (400)\n\n(for some reason, on Ubuntu 64-bit the SOAP message sent to the server by pylotro receives a HTTP 400 Bad Request response, and the XML is empty)\nInstall pylotro\nThe Ubuntu PPA is not available. You can install the Python script from source (article)\n$ wget https://sites.google.com/site/leeslinuxblog/PyLotRO-0.1.15.zip\n$ unzip PyLotRO-0.1.15.zip;cd PyLotRO\n$ sudo python setup.py install\n$ su -c “python setup.py install”\n\nPatch pylotro\nNow apply the special chars and ssl patch to pylotro. The patch is fairly small, so you can do it by hand, it require editing only two files. You will probably need to change permissions first (double check first your PyLotROLauncher is in the same location):\n$ sudo chmod 777 /usr/local/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/PyLotROLauncher/*.py\n\nThen just open the following files in a text editor and apply the changes you see on the patch linked above. Be very careful to use the same TABS indentation when you copy the new lines. Use TABS, not spaces. Start pylotro from Terminal after the changes so you will see an error in case you didn't edit the changes properly.\n$ gedit /usr/local/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/PyLotROLauncher/MainWindow.py\n$ gedit /usr/local/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/PyLotROLauncher/PyLotROUtils.py\n\nResults\nAfter the patch is correctly applied, the launcher gets past the E08 error. You may see an error about the keyring (another problem with Wine on Ubuntu 13.04 64 Bit), but this doesn't prevent from launching the game.\nFor me, the following prefix launched the game just fine on the first try, once pylotrowas patched, on Ubuntu 13.04 64-bit:\n$ export WINEPREFIX=~/.wine_lotro\n$ export WINEARCH=win32\n$ env WINEPREFIX=~/.wine_lotro winecfg\n$ env WINEPREFIX=~/.wine_lotro winetricks d3dx9 vcrun2008 vcrun2005\n\nOf course don't forget to go in pylotro > Options and set the following options to the appropriate directories (below is just an example, with a LOTRO folder copied over from a working LOTRO install in Windows, into the wine \"prefix\"):\nApplication        Wine\nWINEPREFIX         /home/fab/.wine_lotro\nGame Directory     /home/fab/.wine_lotro/drive_c/games/Lord of the Rings Online\nHi-Res Graphics    Enabled\nAdvanced Options   (unchecked)\n\n\nA: For both these games to run you need to install wine(or crossover but i prefer wine)\nFor lotro - lotrolinux.com\nfor DDO see these WineHQ-Dungeons & Dragons Online: Eberron Unlimited,\nDDO, Linux a Howto guide.\n", "Q: How can I get the source code to gnome-system-monitor and use it in my application?

When 12.04 was finally released, I made a bootable USB Flash Drive using Startup Disk Creator.\nThen I decided to check if this drive works properly and to reinstall the system on my desktop. I must add, my desktop behaves a bit strange when it comes to bootable USB's, it recognizes them as HDD.\nIn BIOS I changed priority of boot so USB Flash Drive (recognized as HDD) was first. Successfully booted, I installed Ubuntu. Everything worked fine, but...\nNow I cannot boot from my real HDD. Every time I want to boot, I put the USB Flash Drive into my computer, boot, safely remove it and everything works.\nWhat do I need to do to repair boot?\n\nA: It looks like Grub got installed to the USB drive. Boot with the USB drive, open a terminal window by pressing Ctrl-Alt-T then run\nsudo grub-install /dev/sdX\n\nWhere sdX is the drive you wish to boot from. That command will install GRUB to the MBR of the desired hard drive (sda,sdb,sdc,sdd), which should make it bootable. The commands sudo fdisk -l or lsblk should help you identify which drive you want.\n\nA: You could also try to use repairing software e.g. boot-repair-ubuntu from ppa:yannubuntu/boot-repair\nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:yannubuntu/boot-repair\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get install boot-repair\n\n\nA: I had this problem when trying to install Ubuntu from a persistent USB drive. I started over with a non-persistent USB and it worked fine. It wasn't ideal, but it worked. \n\nA: Boot-Repair\nThe problem\nGrub, Ubuntu's bootloader, was installed on the flash drive, and not on your internal hard drive, as it should have been.\nSolution\nBoot with the flash drive plugged in. Remove it once Ubuntu is booted up.\nRun the following commands from a Terminal:\nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:yannubuntu/boot-repair\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get install -y boot-repair\nboot-repair\n\nClick on the \"Recommended repair\" button, and reboot.\nExplanation\nBoot-Repair installed Grub to your internal hard drive. This allows your computer to boot without depending on the bootloader that was installed on the flash drive.\n\nGlossary\n\nBootloader: a piece of code that runs before any operating system is running. A bootloader is used to boot other operating\n  systems. Each operating system usually has its own bootloader.\nGRUB (Grand Unified Bootloader): a bootloader package developed to support multiple operating systems and allow the user to select among them during boot-up.

Then downloaded Solarized theme for Gnome Terminal. From terminal my vim looks good: plugin vim-powerline displays correctly and syntax is highlighted with proper colors. But when I run tmux and there run vim - syntax highlight uses only one basic color and vim-powerline displays no colors. I looked at the FAQ on vim-powerline and solution should be this line in .tmux-config:\nset -g default-terminal \"screen-256color\"\n\nBut it doesn't work. I looked at TERM and it's return 'xterm' so I tried:\nset -g default-terminal \"xterm-256color\"\n\nBut this also dosen't help. \nThis is the only line in .tmux.config. In .vimrc I have following lines:\ncall pathogen#infect()\nset nocompatible\nset encoding=utf-8\nset laststatus=2\nlet g:Powerline_symbols = 'fancy'\nset t_Co=256\nsyntax enable\nset background=dark\ncolorsheme solarized\n\n\nA: Starting tmux with the following flag fixes this for me:\ntmux -2\n\nfrom tmux man page:\n-2            Force tmux to assume the terminal supports 256 colours.\n\nA: Terminal type should be set to screen-256color in ~/.tmux.conf. It tells tmux what to set the TERM evironment variable, so it won't work for the current session - start a new one and test then.\nIf it still doesn't work, you can run Vim using:\nTERM=screen-256color vi\n\nThis sets the environment variable just for a one-off vi execution.\nIf that doesn't make vim display all the colours, test if your terminal (I'm not sure if you're testing with just one terminal emulator) is compiled to support the 256 colour palette - download and run the below Perl script from the terminal emulator in question.\nhttp://scie.nti.st/dist/256colors2.pl\nPS. I assume you've already corrected the typo jordanbrock noticed.\n\nA: To me it looks like nobody knows what is talking about...\n\nHow does our opening procedure works:\n\n*\n\n*open a terminal (whichever)\n\n*open a tmux\n\n*open vim/nvim\n\n1 Terminal\nOpen a terminal (whichever you use - I use st) and write a command:\n┌───┐\n│ $ │ ziga > ziga--workstation > ~\n└─┬─┘\n  └─> echo $TERM\n\nst-256color\n\nAs answer I got a string st-256color because this string is compiled as the C string literal termname in the st (check here). It is similar with whichever terminal you use. Somewhere in the binary there is a string literal that is set as a enviromental variable TERM when terminal is started.\nHere you can't do anything but to remember this string.\n\n2 Tmux\nNow lets continue the chain...  tmux is opened after your terminal. In configuration file ~/.tmux.conf I must now first make sure to identify enviromental variable TERM that my terminal set. So I write like this:\nset-option -sa terminal-overrides \",st*:Tc\"\n\nThis line checks if enviromental variable $TERM starts with st (therefore st*) and makes sure to use true color (Tc) because current \"indexed colors\" (8 bits = 2^8 = 256 colors) is not enough for us. We want tmux to use \"true colors\" (24 bits = 2^24 = 16777215 colors). Here we could add some more lines just to be sure we will match the value of TERM. In my case the below line also works because it searches for 256col in the middle of TERM:\nset-option -sa terminal-overrides \",*256col*:Tc\"\n\nAnd if I would use xfce4-terminal that sets TERM = xterm-256color I could use a line like this instead:\nset-option -sa terminal-overrides \",xterm*:Tc\"\n\nSo far tmux is covered. But before we continue the chain, we must make sure that tmux as well will export it's enviromental variable TERM.\nIn this case we can set it to whatever we want using this line inside the ~/.tmux.config:\nset -g default-terminal \"tmux-256color\"\n\nNow make sure to exit the tmux and kill it's server:\ntmux kill-server\n\nThen enter tmux by using command tmux and execute command:\n┌───┐\n│ $ │ ziga > ziga--workstation > ~\n└─┬─┘\n  └─> echo $TERM\n\ntmux-256color\n\nYou should get answer tmux-256color. Now we can continue to vim...\n\n3 Vim\nIn our final step we just have to configure vim by adding this line inside it's configuration file ~/.vimrc:\nif exists('+termguicolors') && ($TERM == \"st-256color\" || $TERM == \"tmux-256color\")\n    let &t_8f = \"\\<Esc>[38;2;%lu;%lu;%lum\"\n    let &t_8b = \"\\<Esc>[48;2;%lu;%lu;%lum\"\n    set termguicolors\nendif\n\nThis properly sets escape sequences &t_8f and &t_8b and finally sets \"true colors\" inside vim. But this is done only if TERM value is:\n\n*\n\n*st-256color (when I open vim directly in the st terminal without opening tmux prior to that)\n\n\n*tmux-256color (when I open vim while already in tmux)\nIf you are using multiple terminals, here you should add them like this:\nif exists('+termguicolors') && ($TERM == \"st-256color\" || $TERM == \"tmux-256color\" || $TERM == \"xterm-256color\")\n    let &t_8f = \"\\<Esc>[38;2;%lu;%lu;%lum\"\n    let &t_8b = \"\\<Esc>[48;2;%lu;%lu;%lum\"\n    set termguicolors\nendif\n\nOtherwise colors will not work across all the terminals...

If that's not an option, you can check TERMinside .bashrc and not change it if it's already screen-256color.\n\nA: In the shell starting tmux, check that $TERM is either xterm-256color or screen-256color. See how to change $TERM:\n\n\n*\n\n*Usually change ~/.Xresources is the best way (if supported)\n\n*For gnome-terminal see https://askubuntu.com/a/379472\nAs an alternative, as Holy Mackerel said, you can force tmux to 256color via:\n$ tmux -2\n\n\nA: [Solucion][1]\nthat may disturb your vision and make Vim unpleasant to use for an extended period of time.\nYou can fix this by running :set term=screen-256color in Vim or by relaunching Vim under the TERM=screen-256color environment, as some experts recommend: http://sunaku.github.io/vim-256color-bce.html\n\nA: In your .bashrc or .zshrc just add\nif [[ $TERM == xterm ]]; then\n    TERM=xterm-256color\nfi\n\nand also start with the tmux -2\n\nA: For those, who is consuming time on colors, and if solarized vim doesn’t work on tmux, \nor tired of finding colors of vim, \nthis should work in a minute, also it is from the official repository as follow.\nyum install vim-jellybeans\n\nor \nmkdir -p ~/.vim/colors\ncd ~/.vim/colors\ncurl -O https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nanotech/jellybeans.vim/master/colors/jellybeans.vim\ntouch ~/.vimrc \nsed -i '/colorscheme/d' ~/.vimrc\necho colorscheme jellybeans >> ~/.vimrc\n\nthis will fix it with the beautiful color set and patterns are so focused and useful, if you are also tried to set those highlight, search words, this is it. everything has already set to use.

Open the Wireless Security tab, input your key there and click save. Apparently this will make it stick, or at least did for me.\nGood luck :)\n\nA: I had similar problems, but with a different card/chip, intel ipw2100. \nChanging the IRQ in the BIOS helped for me.\n\nA: The article \"Resolve slow connexion when using wifi in ubuntu 11.04, 11.10, 12.04 Precise Pangolin & LinuxMint12\" has some good insight.

Removing the NVIDIA driver and removing the XORG.CONF file does not lift this restriction. \nI have tried most things that I have found and that were vaguely intelligible, but nothing appears to get me closer to a resolution of 1680x1050.    \nUPDATE: reinstalled Ubuntu 12-04 and used the \"NoModeSet\" in the Grub to restore the resolution to 1280x720, which is at least usable. Will live with this for now.\n\nA: I have been having resolution problems with my brand new Ubuntu 12.04 LTS installation and I couldn' t even see the choice of the 1680x1050 resolution. But then  it was so easily and user-friendly solved: Just went to Additional Drivers in the System Settings tab and activated the NVIDIA accelerated graphics driver(post-release updates)(version current-updates) and it worked for me. Good luck!\n\nA: A few weeks ago, my system suddenly dropped down to 800x600, but there was no any problem the day before, it just happened! Then I started reinstalling Ubuntu, and what you describe started coming out. And jockey (\"Additional Drivers\" in the setting panel) even fail to activate nvidia-current. \nNow I believe that it's the monitor that causes the problems. My monitor is of an unknown manufacturer and now some quality problems have been showing up. I think hardware issues is the only explanation to all these strange things. Try reinstalling Ubuntu after changing your monitor and see if the NVIDIA driver can be install. I haven't try this yet.\n\nA: nomodeset helped during install. After then the screen went all wacko so I remember a youtube video I was watching which it stated to run a fix during boot by running fix all problems. If that did not help try running it in the safe graphics mode and update the card. It worked for me.\n\nA: There are a lot of issues with the 295.40 driver. You can revert to the old nvidia driver 295.33 by following this guide:\nhttp://www.noobslab.com/2011/09/nvidia-drivers-for-ubuntu-1110-oneiric.html\nI have to manually load the nvidia_current kernel module by adding nvidia_current to /etc/modules -- works after reboot, executing \"modprobe nvidia_current\" and \"/etc/init.d/lightdm restart\" works immediately\n\nA: http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=1628678\nI had a very similar issue and this link resolved it for me. Give it a shot!\n\nA: \nUPDATE: Ubuntu 12.04 upgrade: Use Nvidia X server config app to adjust resolution, picking one ** close resolves issue after upgrade. Actual didn't work.\n\nnVidia GeForce 6150 GPU onboard chipset\nPurpose of this post is to assist in activating proprietary driver for onboard 6150 DVI connection to LCD with HDMI connect.\n\nMaverick 10.10\nLinux version 2.6.35-28-generic, NVIDIA GLX Module  260.19.06 \nThe nouveau driver installed by default recognizes LCD monitors connected by DVI/HDMI. This default driver cannot fully utilize the 3D potential of NVIDIA graphics chips or provide 2D acceleration for newer cards. The default resolution choices tend to be below the capabilities of monitor/tv and chipset.\nIf you are considering the installation of the proprietary drivers found under System, Administration, Additional Drivers some preliminary work will ease the process.\nWithout some changes to the xorg.conf file many people have experienced over-scan issues and blank or black screen on reboot post driver install.\nBefore choosing install look in Log File Viewer under System Administration for Xorg log. The Nouveau driver logs some useful information about your graphics system. Look for chipset info: \"NVIDIA NV4e\" and the lines after \"Supported standard timings\".\nExample:\n17.661] (II) NOUVEAU(0): #0: hsize: 1280  vsize 1024  refresh: 60  vid: 32897\n17.661] (II) NOUVEAU(0): #1: hsize: 1360  vsize 765   refresh: 60  vid: 49291\nYou can read more about EDID.\nThe hsize and vsize should be close to resolutions supported by your monitor. Verify these by looking in the manual for the monitor or online at manufacturers website. The supported resolutions have to be manually added to xorg.conf.\nLook for the xorg.conf file under /etc/X11/xorg.conf. You can add, if not there or edit, by opening the terminal application found under accessories and typing \n$ sudo gedit /etc/X11/xorg.conf\nAdd or edit the Screen section of xorg.conf. This example applies to 720p 32\" widescreen lcd tv.\n\nSection \"Screen\"\nIdentifier  \"Default Screen\"\nDefaultDepth    24\nOption  \"UseDisplayDevice\" \"DFP\"\nSubsection  \"Display\"\n   Modes    \"1360x768\" \"1280x720\" \"720x480\"\nEndSubSection\nEndSection\n\n\nSubstitute the display Modes shown above for the resolutions supported by your LCD monitor. The first mode \"1360x768\" will be the default read by nVidia driver upon installation.\nThe option \"UseDisplayDevice\" \"DFP\" will select the dvi connected LCD. This should prevent the black screen upon reboot.\nAfter you've saved the file, activate the driver.\nAdditional information for nVidia with XOrg commands.\n\n", "Q: Ubuntu or Xubuntu for old PC with P4 2.8Ghz, 2GB RAM? What should I install on an older PC with a Pentium 4 2.8 Ghz processor and 2GB RAM? Ubuntu 12.04 or Xubuntu 12.04? Or lets ask: would Xubuntu run much smoother than Ubuntu on this old computer?\n\nA: Xubuntu, or possibly Lubuntu, but Xubuntu has a nice look and feel. I run Xubuntu on my 1Ghz 1GB RAM machine, and it runs wonderfully. On the other hand Ubuntu with Unity runs noticeably slow on it (maybe this would be less of a problem on a 2.8 Ghz machine). Anyways, Xubuntu is a very nice lightweight desktop system.\n\nA: I run ubuntu 10.04 on my 1 GB circa 2000 AMD XP and it works fine. It wouldn't run 12.04 because that version requires the PAE processor capability. An Ubuntu forum post from someone with a 2.5Gz P4 has PAE, so I would assume you could too. 2GB should be more than enough memory. The forum item is: http://ubuntuforums.org/showpost.php?p=5465713&postcount=10. The discussion is about whether he can run 64 bit Ubuntu, and the answer to that was no, but he does have PAE, so that's good to go for standard Ubuntu 12.04. \nIf you have any doubts you can run the code he does on a Linux live cd and make sure you have PAE and therefore can run Ubuntu 12.04.\nI've tried Xubuntu and I liked it. As time goes on and Ubuntu needs faster CPU's and more memory (that happens with every operating system) the lighter weight Xubuntu and Lubuntu might run on it for more releases, and if you might have to eventually switch if you go with Ubuntu now, maybe it makes more sense to run Xubuntu or Lubuntu from the start.\nI'd be remiss if I didn't point out that there is a big element of personal taste to this decision. I think you should try out the Live CD's of each and see what you like. I mean, why not? Actually, that's how I would decide.\n\nA: LXDE-based distros such as Lubuntu would work well. Lubuntu has a \"newer\" look than Xfce or Puppy Linux.\n\nA: Xubuntu and Lubuntu use Xfce and LXDE, very lightweight desktop environments.\nYou should prefer these Ubuntu variants, if you're on an old PC.\n", "Q: How to change keyboard type?

You'll probably need to select different one with compatible layout.\nRelease Notes for Debian 6 (on which Ubuntu is based) says where keyboard model can be found:\n\nIn this new release, the settings for the keyboard have been unified so that both the console and the Xorg server use the same settings.

My laptop is already dual booting with Windows 7 & Ubuntu 11.10, with Ubuntu GRUB bootloader. I would like to go fer a fresh Ubuntu 12.04 installation, without disturbing the Windows 7 boot record info in the current 11.10's GRUB.\nIf I install Ub 12.04, will the new GRUB have the Windows 7 option automatically loaded?\nRestoring Win7 boot and then going for fresh 12.04 install is very risky, i believe.\nI want this with very minimum possible damage.\nPlease help me out.\nRegards,\nUser\n\nA: I've already done what you want to do. I also use to have Windows 7 in one partition and Ubuntu 11.10 in another partition.\nI also did a fresh install of Ubuntu 12.04. Now I have Ubuntu 12.04 and Windows 7 in different partitions.\nDo the following: first, backup your information. Second, boot your computer from a LiveCD. At a certain point of the installation process you will see something similar to this:\n\nChoose the option that says that you want to \"Erase Ubuntu 11.10 and reinstall\" and click \"Install Now\". Nothing will happen to your windows partition. Your old Ubuntu 11.10 will disappear and a new Ubuntu 12.04 will be installed.\nLet me tell you something about fresh installs: sometime they are great, I do it once a year. But after you do a fresh install you will realise all the changes you made to your old Ubuntu, and that you will have to do it again. The problem is when you don't remember how you did it, so you will spent a lot of time configuring everything again.\nThink about doing a fresh install and good luck.\n\nA: Don't worry, just type in terminal:\nsudo do-release-upgrade\n\n\nA: Just type in terminal the below command.\nsudo update-grub\n\nAfter that restart computer.\n\nA: OK, I'm not completely clear on which direction you want to go, so I'm going to say more than is probably needed.\nMy understanding from your question is that you \n\n\n*\n\n*Already have Windows and Ubuntu 11.10 installed in different partitions on your laptop's hard drive.\n\n*You want to install Ubuntu 12.04.\n\n\nIt is not clear to me whether you want to migrate/upgrade your current 11.10 install to 12.04 or install 12.04 separately from both Windows and 11.10.\nIt seems most plausible that you simply want to upgrade your 11.10 to 12.04. This is what the suggestions to run the command do-release-upgrade in a terminal window were about. This is one of the ways to begin the upgrade process.\nActually, there are several different paths you can take to upgrade an existing install to 12.04. These are covered in detail in this question: How do I upgrade from 10.04 or 11.10 to 12.04? which I suggest you look at.\nWhile it is possible to upgrade from 11.10 to 12.10 without install media, my opinion is that it's not a bad idea to have a 12.04 Live CD or USB available \"just in case\" it happens to be needed.\nAnd if you do want to install 12.04 but also keep both Windows and 11.10, you will definitely need to boot from a 12.04 Live CD or USB.\nWhichever way you go as long as Windows is already installed when you begin, it should be detected and included in the GRUB boot menu. This works the same way in 12.04 as it did in 11.10. You should not need to bother with sudo update-grub. It should happen as part of either upgrade processing or new install processing.\n\nA: in the process of installation make sure that you are not touching the partitions that have Ubuntu 11.10 and windows 7 . so its better to choose the manual option (last option) before step of choosing partitions. then choose the harddisk partition which you want give or 12.04 . \ndont worry about the GRUB , it will take care of Ubuntu 11.10 and Windows 7 to have in the GRUB menu . i am sure about it will work for you .\n", "Q: Upgrades from previous versions I have couple of questions about upgrades:\n\n\n*\n\n*Why is Ubuntu still including the release name in the sources.list? The package manager could get this information from /etc/lsb-release. And it's really not necessary to change this file every time one upgrades.\n\n*Is there a way to list packages installed by the user? It would be useful to be able to quickly install everything one had installed in previous releases, without installing system level packages that are no longer used by the distribution (such as hal).\n\nA: How I can get list all packages installed by myself system(except their dependency) .\nThen package manager can learn system version from /etc/lsb-release? Because now you have to put distro name in source file for each source. It's really stupid. And for keep sources necessary change system name for each line in file.  \n\nA: *\n\n*Updating sources.list really isn't much of a problem. update-manager handles it all for you. It is useful to have sources that don't have the same code-name as the release (including things like security updates, which are $release-security.\n\n*I believe software center lets you see what packages you had installed previously.\n", "Q: Recover Lost MediaWiki I have a MySQL installation of MediaWiki, hosted with ThrustVPS. Something has become corrupted on the server, and it is in a non-bootable state. I don't have physical access to the machine, but their techs offered to back up any folders I need to to recover my site and then rebuild my machine. The problem is, I don't know what folders I need to save to restore my wiki. All the backup instructions I have seen require console access to the machine. Clearly, I should have done that before (and was planning on it so I could move hosting providers), but didn't. If anyone knows what I need to recover, I'd appreciate it. (I installed everything with the defaults whenever possible)\n\nA: Data; All the data input into MediaWiki will be in the database (which by default is MySQL) so you'll need to get the admins to give you a MySQL dump of the database.\nApp; The application itself is most likely all within one directory called \"Wiki\" or \"Mediawiki\" inside your Web Folder.. The most important single file to get is the LocalSettings.php file which is the file that contains all your configuration options.\nAs long as you have the data however, rebuilding all the other files to get mediawiki working again is reasonably trivial as they're all available on the Mediawiki site for download. (Just make sure your grabbing the correct version.. or if not ensure you follow the upgrade instructions to get the database into the right shape)\n", "Q: Tapping ALT brings up love handles, not the HUD Just upgraded from 11.10 to 12.04 and wanted to test out some of the new keyboard shortcuts.\nI probably have some config files sitting around from my 11.10 install, in particular I think I may have set ALT to bring up love handles on my windows so I could resize them easier when using my trackpad on my laptop.\nNow it seems that the HUD has been assigned to tap ALT (at least according to the shortcut cheat sheet when I long press on SUPER) but when I tap alt all I get is love handles on my focused window.\nDon't get me wrong, the love handles are excellent and I'd like to keep one of my keys as a shortcut to bringing them up to resize windows, but I would like to try out the HUD as well... where can I go to reset these keyboard shortcuts?\n\nA: From System settings -> Keyboard -> Shortcut -> Launchers we can assign any another key for the HUD:\n\n", "Q: Wirless disabled by hardware switch on a Toshiba Notebook Model: NB205-N311/W I've got a Toshiba Notebook Model: NB205-N311/W\nit has no external Wireless hardware switch.

I am using a PCI graphics card (EVGA GeForce 8400 GS). I am using an HDMI cable to transmit the display. I have already checked and updated propriety drivers (got the NVIDIA drivers from the propriety driver option in the System Settings). The problem is: about half a centimeter is cut off of the top and bottom of the screen, a good centimeter is cut off both right and left sides. In addition to it being to \"zoomed in\" the quality of the image is not very good. Image doesn't look sharp or crisp at all. Colors are dull and nothing is overly vibrant, poor picture quality in general.\nHere's the catch...this exact t.v monitor and the graphics card worked GREAT on Ubuntu 11.10, but ever since I upgraded to 12.04 the display has been crappy.\nIn Display under System Settings it shows the display as \"unknown\" and the resolution is set to the maximum (1280 X 720). Also, I went into my monitor's settings and ensured that the vertical and horizontal position/sizes were not increased or dis-positioned to create this \"zoomed in\" effect.\nAny help is MUCH appreciated!\nThanks, Preston.\n\nA: Check your nvidia settings configuration utility (IIRC nvidia-setting) and look for an overscan option. This sounds very much like overscan.\n\n", "Q: 12.04 beta upgrade to 12.04 stable A lot of advice has been flying around today about upgrading from beta to 12.04 stable, and most people are simply saying they are the same, however; In my experience it appears that they are not the same:\nThis is run from my \"beta\" build of 12.04. \n$apt-get upgrade:\nThe following packages have been kept back:\n\n linux-generic linux-headers-generic linux-image-generic\n\n\n$ uname -a\nLinux ****** 3.2.0-23-generic #36-Ubuntu SMP Tue Apr 10 20:39:51 UTC 2012 x86_64  x86_64 x86_64 GNU/Linux\n\n$ sudo apt-get dist-upgrade\nReading package lists... Done\nBuilding dependency tree       \nReading state information... Done\nCalculating upgrade... Done\nThe following NEW packages will be installed:\n  linux-headers-3.2.0-24 linux-headers-3.2.0-24-generic\n  linux-image-3.2.0-24-generic\nThe following packages will be upgraded:\nlinux-generic linux-headers-generic linux-image-generic\n3 upgraded, 3 newly installed, 0 to remove and 0 not upgraded.\nNeed to get 50.5 MB of archives.\nAfter this operation, 216 MB of additional disk space will be used.\nDo you want to continue [Y/n]? n\nAbort.\n\nAre we sure it's the same? It really appears as though release has a new build of kernel (-24-) that beta can't install without upgrading\n\nA: dist-upgrade is not an upgrade as you think it is. It handles the removal and addition of packages which apt-get upgrade doesn't. So if you run a sudo apt-get dist-upgrade on your 12.04 beta installation, all packages will be updated to the final 12.04 state. This is no different than running the updates once the final has been released.\n\nA: Once 12.04 is out the update manager will pop up complaining that a new version of Ubuntu was released and asking if you want to update\n\nIf you press that button it will be the same as typing apt-get dist-upgrade. A normal apt-get upgrade will not make system changes necessary to upgrade all the packages to its final release since it does not make system changes and does not remove packages on its own.\nWhen people say that beta 2 is so close to the final release they mean the truth, the packages are so mature at the moment that not much will change. But you are still stuck in a beta. You need to either press that button or use apt-get dist-upgrade to move the packages to stable and failing to do so will prevent further important upgrades from being installed.\nAfter you have done so, you will be running that stable system just as if you installed it right now and you will continue to receive the updates available for the final release.\n", "Q: How can I get the browser to render font exactly like Windows 7? \nPossible Duplicate:\nHow can I make fonts look like they do in Windows? \n\nI don't like the small fonts in the browser. However, increasing the size causes trouble; the last word in a sentence will start a new line. This is really ugly.\nI want the exact same font rendering in the browser as in Windows 7 (pixel for pixel) because web pages are made for it. It is the right size and has the right number of pixels between letters and so on (yes, i am picky).\nIf possible, anyone know how to do this?\n\nA: Pixel by pixel exact same rendering? Nope, not possible. And if it were, it would likely be in violation of patents regarding e.g. Microsoft ClearType, the \"new\" (since XP or something) font rendering techniques especially tailored for LCDs.\nYou can, however, get as close as possible by:\n\n\n*\n\n*using the exact same browser version and settings on both systems;\n\n*installing your Windows fonts on your Linux system; and\n\n*playing around with the level of anti-aliasing etc. offered to you by either GUI tools or by manually editing your fonts.conf file.\n\n\nOr if you are truly repulsed by the font rendering in mainly the browser, see if the Windows version gives you good results when you run it using Wine.\n", "Q: Update 11.04 to 12.04 with LiveCD \nPossible Duplicate:\nHow do I upgrade straight from a very old release to the latest one? \n\nI'm trying to update my current Ubuntu 11.04 install to 12.04 while keeping the files, settings and installed applications but without having to go through updating to Ubuntu 11.10 as an intermediate step, that is, without using Ubuntu Update Manager.\nI've read on the Internet that the LiveCD (and possibly LiveUSB too) installer offers an option to upgrade a version older than 11.10 in the installer. However, it is not available to me.\nMore specifically, I'm looking for the second option in this screenshot:\nhttp://4.bp.blogspot.com/_1QSDkzYY2vc/TWzh8Z786xI/AAAAAAAADNw/8lXqgCMgicY/s2000/ubuntu11.04-installer.png\n...but with the version numbers changed to 12.04 (I swear I've seen a screenshot of the 12.04 Beta version installer with that option, but can't find it now). Has it been removed from the 12.04 LTS installer?\nOr should I be using the alternate CD?\nIt's very important to me not to have to go through two Ubuntu versions as my internet connection is slow and downloading 11.10 first would be a waste of bandwidth as well as time (both for downloading and installation).\nThanks\n\nA: The transition between 11.04 to 11.10 was quite dramatic since it involved moving from GTK+2/gnome libraries to GTK+3/gnome libraries.  This is the support route that was well tested.\nSimilarly well tested is the similar 10.04LTS to 12.04 LTS upgrade.\nMoving from 11.04 to 12.04 in one step is not supported and I urge you not to go down this route since you are more likely to break your desktop & installation.\nSince you have downloaded 12.04 - I would go for a fresh install.\nIf you have any files & folders from your 11.04 install, back these up - you can reinstall these later.\n", "Q: Ralink RT2790 (or maybe a RT2860), detected as two different chipsets, can't connect Today,\nI have installed 12.04 & my wifi stopped working.

And I think chipset in this card is RT2860(not RT2790), correct me if I am wrong. I further suspect this wrong detection in Ubuntu 12.04 is the reason that it doesn't connect/work. \nSo,\nPlease let me know if my suspicion is correct? If yes, then what I need to do to fix this mess & get my wireless card working in Ubuntu 12.04? \n\nA: Maybe the fault is not in Ubuntu 12.04 itself, but instead on the kernel, where (amongst others) wifi drivers are included. Upgrading to an even newer kernel (or an older one=¡?) could make things work. \nAnother solution could be to use ndiswrapper with the RT2860 Windows drivers. I know it's not ideal, but could work.\n\nA: This is due to a bug in the Linux kernel 3.2, which was fixed in later version. I know this because I tried the latest Kernel Linux 3.4 in which this card works out of the box. I have filled out a bug report on launchpad, but so far the bug has not been fixed.\nLaunchpad Bug Link: [Bug 989473] Ralink RT2860[1814:0781] Wireless card worked in 10.10, stopped working in 12.04\n", "Q: Unity 3d no longer works after installing 12.04 I just installed Ubuntu 12.04 by cd. Unity 3D will not work now only 2D It worked fine in 11.10 and also when I upgraded to the beta of 12.04 through update manager. I tried both Nvidia Proprietary Drivers on the list with no luck. I had many more driver choices in 11.10 and 12.04 beta but the default installed driver always worked before this install. I get a black screen and the wall paper sometimes shows for a few seconds and then goes back to the black screen using Unity 3D.\n\nA: You may be affected by Bug #982485 if Unity 3D was working on the Beta, but isn't working now.  It looks like it is affecting Geforce 6*** and Geforce 7*** cards.  Nvidia is aware of the bug, so hopefully there will be a fix rolled out soon.\nIf you want Unity 3D to work in the meantime, try to add the Ubuntu-X Updates PPA and downgrade the nvidia-current package to 295.33.\n(tip for GUI users:  use Ctrl+Alt+F1 to get to a text mode login, then type in your login/password at the command line interface to get to a place where you can issue the following commands)\nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:ubuntu-x-swat/x-updates\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get install nvidia-current=295.33-0ubuntu1~precise~xup1\n\nImportant notes:\n\n\n*\n\n*There was a security bug in 295.33 so you have to factor this into your decision about whether or not to downgrade.\n\n*You will have to uncheck the nvidia-current package from the Update Manager when you upgrade your system to prevent it from re-installing version 295.40.\nWhether or not you downgrade your nvidia driver, watch the bug listing (or subscribe to it) to know when the bug gets fixed so you can upgrade your driver then.\n", "Q: Netbeans all menu fonts are bold after upgrade to 12.04 After updating ubuntu to 12.04 all fonts got bold.

By default it will only offer upgrades to the next LTS in a few years time.\nTo force it to offer upgrading to a normal release such as 12.10 you can open Software sources and set Show new distribution releases to Normal releases.\nSee this answer here: https://askubuntu.com/a/125646/27968\n\nA: 12.01 is less then 12.04. Meaning it's not an update. I assume you mean 12.10. Please update your question if that is the case. \n12.04 is a LTS release. By default it only updates to the next LTS release (13.something a long time from now) You can change this by running update-manager from the terminal and clicking settings. On the \"Updates\" tab select Notify me \"For any new version\". Then close the window.\nRun update-manager again and you should get a little popup for the upgrade.\nMake sure this is what you want to do though.

I think that Juju is a technology that has the potential to help a lot of sysadmins, it would be great to have a good tutorial for using it in other clouds, such as gandi.net1. Is there any way to run juju in non aws2 clouds?\n\nA: As of Ubuntu 12.04, and the \"0.5+bzr531\" release of Juju that comes with it, Juju can only speak 3 API's:\n\n\n*\n\n*EC2 - This is actually EC2 and S3 for charm storage\n\n*Orchestra - This    is Cobbler + WEBDAV for charm storage.\n\n*MaaS - This uses MaaS much    like Orchestra used Cobbler, and MaaS has the file storage built-in    rather than relying on a secondary WEBDAV.\n\n\nThe EC2 API lets Juju deploy things into OpenStack clouds, and in theory, CloudStack and Eucalyptus, though neither of those are regularly tested by the Juju dev team.\nJuju can also spin up LXC containers on linux machine to create a simulated cloud on a single machine.\nThe effort to add another cloud API is pretty small. You need to be able to start, stop, and list machines, and then you need some shared object storage so charms can be stored by clients and retrieved by any of the machines.\nOne wrinkle for the immediate addition of any other cloud providers is that Juju is undergoing a rewrite from Python to Go. Because of that, any effort that goes into the Python version will see limited attention from Juju development long term as the Go port matures.\n", "Q: 12.04 upgrade from 11.10 failed, cannot finish upgrade After running the upgrade from 11.10 to 12.04, the upgrade manager crashed during the installation portion. \nNow, when I run the update manager, it tells me:\nNot all updates can be installed.\nRun a partial upgrade, to install as many updates as possible.\n\nHowever, when I click \"Partial Upgrade,\" I get this error:\nFailed to run /usr/bin/update-manager '--dist-upgrade' as user root.\nUnable to copy the user's Xauthorization file.\n\nHow can I get my upgrade to finish?\nI have tried several suggestions I've found on the internet, including sudo dpkg --configure -a, but always get errors.\n\nA: In such cases I solve this problem by using terminal instead Upgrade Manager:  \n\n\n*\n\n*Update sourcelists.

Either in the mbox format which is a single file with delimiters and what not to help separate the messages or, in the Maildir format which keeps each message in a separate file and each virtual directory in the email server is a real directory.\nWhen you specify the home_mailbox with a / at the end then it means that you are telling postfix to use Maildir. Without the / then it uses mbox. The part before that is the name of the mbox or Maildir that you are storing and can be called anything but most people prefer to use the name Maildir/ as it's more accurate of the content. \nYou can technically use sudo postconf -e 'home_mailbox = put_my_mail_here/' and it will create a Maildir format mailbox labeled \"put_my_mail_here\" which will be the name of the folder in the home dir where the Maildir data is stored. \nAnother option would be to use .Maildir/ which will create a \"hidden\" folder with the content.\n", "Q: Graphics experience?

Alright here's what I'm looking for help with.\nI want to Partition my external Gofelx drive so that I can install 4 OS's on it.\nUbuntu, Kubuntu, Windows Seven/8 and another linux distro I know I will eventually pick to put on it.\nI have had experience with dual booting OS's since currently I have a linux distro installed on the drive and experience somewhat with gparted live since I once had to use it to fix a problem with the drive.\nIt's a 500 gig drive and I was thinking of making the partitions 40 gigs each for the linux and 50 for the windows, leaving me with the rest of the drive as storage room for files and backups and whatnot.\nPut short I just need some help making sure I'm doing this right to make sure I don't screw up.\nFrom what I know, what I want to do is start up gparted live and use it to format and partition the drive in 5 partitions, the 3 40 gig partitions, the 1 50 gig and the rest for storage.\nGparted lists file sizes as MiB, not MB, no problem we have calculators for a reason.\nSo I want 3 37.253 GiB partitions, 1 46.566 partition and rest as free space.\nThen it comes to installing the OS's, which is where I get a bit wary about things.\nSo I know there are multiple ways of installing OS's to a drive or a partition on a drive, just want to make sure I don't screw things up.\nSo do I say take wubi, and install the ubuntu and kubuntu distros to the designated partitions with it, or should I burn them to disc, which I would prefer not to do since, well physical media costs money.\nOr should I try something like YUMI to install them to the partitions.\nI also have heard you can use virtual box to install OS's to drives/partitions.\nI also have image mounting software I was wondering if I could use that somehow to install to the partitions from within windows.\nAnd then comes the worst part, install windows 7/8.\nIf I can just use YUMI, would I use it for that as well or what, here's where I really go off the ropes, since I may be native to windows, but understand more about how to operate with linux.\n\nA: Ok many questions but I will give it a try. Here the answers:\n\nFirst you can partition like you said. But notice: You should first create an extended volume since primary partitions are limited to just 5 partitions. With extended its no problem.\nYou should also take care of swap (a bit more than your ram usage or more than double your ram size if you want to hibernate. Because hibernating means to write your RAM to the swap space and if there is already something it needs more space.)\nNext: I prefer to install windows first because Windows always breaks Grub and all custom bootloaders. Every linux distribution supports detecting other operating systems.\nAfter installing Windows you can proceed to Ubuntu and to the rest.\nNotice In Ubuntu (or whatever you change as first distribution to install) you should install the bootloader to your hard disk /dev/sdX (X refers to your hard disk drive) and every Linux afterwards should not install Grub to MBR.\nAt the end of your installation routine you can boot into your Ubuntu or first chosen Linux system and do update-grub.\n\nHow you can install without CD/DVD:\nUse multisystem for more than one ISO on a USB drive. So you can save time. If you prefer installing every single ISO to your USB drive you can check out UNetbootin.  \n\nIf you choose Multisystem:\n\n\n*\n\n*Download the required ISOs\n\n*Load them all into Multisystem\n\n*Quit multisystem\n\n*Boot from USB drive\n\n*Choose first distribution you want to install\n\n*Wait for being booted (could take some minutes)\n\n*Install distribution as it would be on a CD/DVD to your hard drive\n\n*Reboot again into USB drive\n\n*Choose your next Linux\n\n*Repeat this from 6 to 9\n\n\nIf you choose Unetbootin:\n\n\n*\n\n*Download all ISOs\n\n*Install the first ISO to USB drive\n\n*Reboot and install the distribution\n\n*Reboot into another system and copy the next ISO to the stick\n\n*Do this loop too\n\n\nBy the way: Good luck and have fun ;)\n", "Q: Installed Ubuntu upgrade 12.04 and USB external speakers won't work.

I have a problem with my laptop,in which I'd had windows xp. That XP crashed and I couldn't restore it with the Install CD. So, I placed Ubuntu 11.10 install on a Pendrive, searched for some bad blocks(less than 500), hard drive had a entire format  and everything looks fine but the progress bar hangs about 20% and the install didn't finish over night? What should I do?\n\nA: After writing the digression below, it occurred to me that I should probably also mention why I wrote it.\nAny form of sector write or read error on a drive should be viewed as a potential warning. The drive could be failing. Certainly if a drive is reporting as many as 500 bad blocks, I would dig deeper into this before installing anything on the drive.\nAs I mentioned below, you can use Ubuntu Disk Utility from a Live CD/USB to examine the drive's SMART attributes. If the drive only has few pending reads, you can fill the drive with zeros to force the sectors to be remapped and then do another Ubuntu install.\nBut watch the drive carefully for further signs of failure and don't save anything critical on it unless it is also backed up. If the drive continues to show sector errors, consider shopping for a replacement drive. Soon.\nJust my opinion of course, for whatever it's worth.\n\nThese days it is hard to be certain what the phrase bad blocks actually means. In the pre-deluvian days of computing ... say 15 years or more ago ... it could refer to a list the operating system kept of sectors on a hard drive which the drive reported to be, well, bad.\nAll relatively recent drives now do this sort of tracking internally in their firmware and operating systems no longer need to track such things.\nThis Wikipedia article on Bad Sectors seems to be a reasonable overview. The key points being:\n\n\n*\n\n*While the hard drive will automatically attempt to remap a bad sector, it typically only does this when a write fails. Read errors are reported to the OS and logged in the drive's S.M.A.R.T. data, but the sector is not remapped.\n\n*The standard way to force the drive to remap all bad sectors is to write to every byte on the drive. Typically one fills all the sectors with 0x00.\n\n*If a drive has reported one or more bad sectors, it is possible that the drive may be approaching failure. The drive's S.M.A.R.T. data should be examined, especially the following S.M.A.R.T. attributes\n   0x05  Reallocated Sectors Count (How many sectors were remapped)\n   0xC5  Current Pending Sector Count (How many sectors waiting to be remapped)\n\n\nYou can use an Ubuntu Live CD or USB to do these things.\nAfter booting the Live CD/USB, open the Disk Utility application either with the GUI by searching for it with Dashor by running the command palimpsest & in a terminal. Select the disk in the left sidebar and then use the SMART Status function to retrieve and view the drive's S.M.A.R.T. attributes.\nThe  dd command command can be used from a terminal window in a Live CD/USB session to fill a drive with zeros. For example, the command below will write 0x00 to every sector on drive /dev/sda\nsudo dd if=/dev/zero bs=1M of=/dev/sda\n\nOf course, depending on the size of the drive this could take many hours to complete. \nIf you are curious, there are many more \"tricks\" one can use with dd. Have a look at the answers to this question on serverfault. I especially like this trick for periodically displaying the progress of a dd command.\n\nA: BEST ADVICE (rather than solution)\nIf the hard drive is currently stable, and not deteriorating, then a low-level format will map any \"bad sectors\" to be unused.  The BIOS, HDD controller, and OS should be able to handle any \"slow deterioration\" after that.\nWhat you are describing could be more serious, and/or a bad controller.\nI would strongly suggest getting the laptop checked out, or (at least) getting a test tool that will stress test the drive and show it \"stable\" or still getting worse ..\n\nA: I'm using intensively three hd's with bad blocks since years without any problems. The oldest is over ten years old, the newer ones 5 or 6 years. I think those bad blocks are anoying, if you loose date but david6 thought of low level format seems the best idea for me. \nYou should install/use that reformated disk and have a regular look at the smart-data of your drive (eg. bad blocks, relocated blocks). Smart-data isnt absolutely reliable but give a good overview of the health status. If you use your reformated disk and you don't see increased bad blocks/relocations, then youre on the lucky side. If you find segnicant more bad blocks or reports a remaining life-time then i would change the drive - its about to die.\nBTW: After low-level formating the drive it is NOT necessary to run \"badblocks\" or such utilities. The drives firmware will handle this without user interaction. When the operating system tries to write to one of those bad blocks, the firmware will silently relocate the bad block.\n\nA: You must exclude bad blocks on file system before you begin.\nBoot from LiveCD and run this command (assuming that your target partition is sda1):\nfsck -M -cc /dev/sda1\n\nThis command will check file system on partition /dev/sda1 and will exclude bad blocks from usage. Option -M tells to not check mounted filesystem.\nNote: this command will not remap bad blocks on hard drive! It works only for target file system. If you want to remap bad blocks you can do that with Windows chkdsk /f /r command.\nAfter that you may run install but you have to chose manual disk partitioning during setup.\n\nA: I did install Ubuntu on a net-top containing bad blocks at the start of the drive so during the partitioning stage I put the '/' partition at the END of the drive (it gives you that option), also the separate '/home' partition at the END also but I shrank it so that It was 30gb smaller than the leftover space to skip the bad sectors.  \nThe install worked fine although if the drive contains bad sectors then it may slowly get worse and is time for a replacement HD...\n", "Q: Maximize dialog windows? Solution:\n\n\n*\n\n*If you're on standard Unity which uses Compiz for 3D compositing, use compizconfig-settings-manager.  See WeAreGeek's answer below.\n\n*If you're on Unity 2D, as I am, then wmctrl is the only way, per user55822's answer.  apt-get wmctrl gconf-editor, open gconf-editor, navigate to apps \\ metacity \\ keybinding_commands, bind user55822's command string to command_1, then navigate to apps \\ metacity \\ global_keybindings, and set run_command_1 to the key combination you want to use.  Details here.\n\nSome dialog windows are too small and I have to painstakingly drag the corners to make them big enough to be useful (looking at you Chrome/ium bookmark dialog).  Is there any way to maximize these with a shortcut key, mouse is too slow.\nI found a related discussion but the solution is already implemented in my Ubuntu 12.04 installation and doesn't have any effect on dialog windows. \nEdit:  Clarification on the specific window I'm talking about:  In Chrome/ium, hit CTRL-d.  It will bring up an Add Bookmark dialog with a \"Folder:\" dropdown menu.  Scroll that menu down, all the way to the last selection \"Choose Another Folder\".  That will close this menu and open a new one, \"Edit Bookmark\", which is detached from the browser.  That's the main one I want to maximize but can't.\n\nA: Press ALT and pull the window with your middle mouse click while holding both.\n\nA: Try Ctrl+Alt+5\n(I don't know if this will work on the particular windows/dialogs you're talking about.)\n\nA: Not sure about your windows, seems like I just dont have any like it, but you could try wmctrl (need to be installed) and bind something like\nwmctrl -r :ACTIVE: -e 0,500,400,0,10\n\nman wmctrl for options.\n\nA: I have resolved this by installing compizconfig-settings-manager and enabling the \"Window Rules\" plugin. You can make a rule \"type=Dialog\" for \"Maximize\". Now all Dialog windows are opened maximized. You could also make a \"Size Rule\" to have dialoges opened at a fixed size.\nI found a bugreport for this: https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/unity/+bug/774254\n", "Q: How can I have two launchers, one on the left side of my left screen and on the right side of my right screen?

I had that problem with a logitech mx518.  The cable was bad and ubuntu is (was?) a little iffy on disconnecting and reconnecting your mouse over and over.\n\nA: Your USB power might be failing because there are too many devices. Try plugging them into a different place; you might have to try several ports before you find a configuration that works or even makes the situation better. Also, if you are using a USB hub disconnect it from there.\nTo see if this is really the problem, open up a terminal, then when the mouse fails, type in lsusb and see if the mouse appears in the list. If the mouse has disappeared then lack of USB power is likely your problem.\nA USB mouse can actually take up much power compared to other devices, and you might want to find a substitute.

It may help to clean the CD/DVD, to burn the CD/DVD at a lower speed, to clean the CD/DVD drive lens (cleaning kits are often available from electronics suppliers), to check whether the hard disk is old and in need of replacement, or to move the system to a cooler environment.\n\nWhy am I facing this problem when I'm using a live USB, not a CD?DVD? How can I get past it? I want to install Ubuntu on my hard disk.\n\nA: Such errors usually indicate that some files on the Live CD/USB are corrupted. Since you use a USB, the files may have been corrupted while downloading. If you don't have the .iso image, please download it, and then check its integrity.\nYou'll have to check you memory using a memtest. Also, check the .iso image using instructions here: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/HowToMD5SUM\nYou can download the image using the live USB. Boot from the USB stick and select \"Try Ubuntu\". Open Firefox and go to download the .iso, but make sure you download it to another USB stick or hard disk and not to any of the live CD's home folder directories, to ensure you don't run out of RAM and crash. \nAlternatively, you could use the bittorrent downloads using this guide to make sure you don't get any data flaws.\n", "Q: I need help with Ubuntu and my Xbox 360 I am trying to integrate my Ubuntu system with my Xbox 360.

Hope someone can help me hehe\n\nA: The first step is to open startup apps and see what is there, might be as easy as that,\nif those apps are in startup, you can just remove them \nAnother option to consider is ubuntu tweak, it can help you regulate how things start \n\nA: There are two possible reasons why the application is started: It is saved in the last session or it is listed in the auto started applications. Follow 1 of the two steps below to get rid of the applications.  \n\n\n*\n\n*Start the xfce4-autostart-editor and remove the application(s). You can also manually delete those files in ~/Desktop/Autostart and ~/.config/autostart.  \n\n*Most of the time closing all the applications and save your session when you logout is sufficient. If this doesn't work, remove the content of the ~/.cache/sessions/ directory when you're not logged in.

In Eclipse, if I do \"Help\" > \"Check for updates\" I see 8 packages which are grayed out with the message \"Insufficient access privileges to apply this update.\"  Any idea how I fix this?\n\nA: If you install Eclipse from the Ubuntu repository, the Eclipse install will be owned by root.  The proper way to update base packages is to use the Ubuntu upgrade tools, not the Eclipse update tools.  I believe it is possible to install addons in your Workspace but I would not recommend mixing package managers.\nIf you want to use the Eclipse update process you need to download the Eclipse from the Eclipse download site.   When I do that, I install under /opt after setting the privileges to my user id to write there.  Unpackage as the user you will be using to run Eclipse.  \nEDIT: I often the permissions on /opt to 1777 to allow anyone to create packages there.  Alternatively I use chgrp users /opt and set the permissions to 1775.  This allows members of the uses group to add new packages to /opt. \n\nA: sudo eclipse\n\nDid the job for me, I was able to install new software (eclipse add-ons) and work with\nit after restart of eclipse.\n\nA: I'm not a big expert in Eclipse, but my understanding is that Eclipse's own update system is sort of concurrent to Ubuntu update system (this is also true for many other packages which have their own update methods, for example Python modules - you can either install them from Ubuntu repos using apt-get install, or from Python package index using easy_install). \nIn those cases, the other, non-Ubuntu update mechanism will try to override files installed from Ubuntu repositories, which, naturally, would require root privileges. Also, I'm not sure it is a good idea - it is likely to create a total mess of files partially installed from Ubuntu repositories and partially using the application's update system.\nThe point is - if you installed Eclipse from Ubuntu repositories, it is better to stick with updates available from Ubuntu repositories and ignore the \"Check for updates\" option in Eclipse. If you require some Eclipse plugin/extension, you also should install it from Software Center.\nIf Ubuntu versions of Eclipse packages are not bleeding edge enough for you, I'd recomment to download a separate copy of Eclipse from their website (you can also choose the version of Eclipse this way) and run it from your home directory - this actually is quite easy. Then you will be able to update that copy of Eclipse using its own update mechanism and install any plugines, even if they're not available in Ubuntu repos. \n\nA: Ubuntu Software Center\nIf you are installing a package through the Ubuntu Software Center, then you should not update from within Eclipse (the OS software-update service would make those changes).\nIf you would like to manage your own application versioning, you need to download the tar from Eclipse directly (recently, you can download a specialized version for Android Development).\nManual Installation\n\n\n*\n\n*I downloaded eclipse-SDK-4.2-linux-gtk-x86_64.tar.gz from the Eclipse download site\nFor single-user only (easiest)\n\n\n*\n\n*I unpacked it and copied it to my home in a new subdirectory ~/bin/\n\n*I put the Android SDK into the dropin folder for Eclipse (in my case ~/bin/eclipse/dropins/)\n\n*I continued with the rest of the steps for installing the ADT Plugin.\nSince I used a custom path for the Android SDK, I had to specify that in the Eclipse Window > Preferences.\n\n\nInstallation for all users\n\n\n*\n\n*The following is taken from my answer to a question on android-studio so you will have to change references from android-studio to your Eclipse specifics.\n\n\n\nIf you want android-studio to be available to all users (based on\n  the above) you should be unpacking the tar to /opt rather than\n  the /usr/local or /usr/bin (with the latter being preferred for\n  specific-user installations).  Setup properly, we shouldn't need to\n  change user group permissions or any other high-level administration.\n  \n  \n*\n  \n*Unpack the .tar file where it lays \n  \n*Using a Terminal window, navigate to that folder location (probably cd ~/Downloads), invoke sudo -i (You will need\n  administrator/su permissions for the next few steps)\n  \n*mv android-studio /opt moves the files you unpacked (requires permissions)\n  \n*gedit android-studio.desktop this opens a text editor so that we may create a shortcut icon to open your new program.  Insert the\n  following code, then save the .desktop file.\n\n    [Desktop Entry]\n     Name=Android-Studio\n     Comment=your comments\n     Exec=/opt/android-studio/bin/studio.sh\n     Icon=/opt/android-studio/bin/idea.png\n     Terminal=false\n     Type=Application\n     Categories=Utility;IDE;Development;\n\n\n  \n*\n  \n*To finish up, desktop-file-install android-studio.desktop\nWe are done with the terminal window, you can close it or exit  That\n  .desktop file now allows you to search for and find android-studio\n  within Ubuntu's Unity interface.  In other words, click that icon in\n  the upper-left to search for android-studio  You may  right-click\n  on the icon while it is running and \"lock it to the launcher.\"\nYou can also create menu options to appear for your application\n  launcher, see the Ubuntu Documentation on Unity Launchers.\n\n\nA: Eclipse's update mechanism doesn't know about or communicate with Ubuntu's package management system (PMS).  Thus, if you update through Eclipse's update mechanism you can cause problems between it and Ubuntu's PMS (files out of sync, botched configurations, etc.).\nIf you're a serious developer and need later versions of Eclipse, you're better off installing Eclipse outside of Ubuntu's PMS as the PMS is always so laughably out of date where Eclipse is concerned.  Example: I'm on Ubuntu 14.04 LTS and even after doing sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get upgrade before posting this, the latest Eclipse version available through the PMS is 3.8.1-5.1, but 4.6.1 has been out for a while now.  This has always been the case -- the version of Eclipse available in Ubuntu PMS is always considerably-to-extremely outdated.\n", "Q: Wireless suddenly dropping with a Ralink RT2870 I have a Linksys WUSB600N v1 Dual-Band Wireless-N Network Adapter Ralink RT2870 USB dongle that worked flawlessly in 11.10.

I realize that pgadmin3 is not a Gnome app, but it is a GUI app included with Ubuntu and it should work with the default desktop (Unity, that is).\nThankfully, every instance of pgadmin does show up in the \"window spread\" (Super-W) view.\nI guess for now I will have to adapt my habits to use Super-W instead of Alt-Tab (or clicking the active launcher icon).\nAny ideas? Where should I file a bug? Under pgadmin3, Unity, or...?\n\nA: Short but annoying answer: reboot (or perhaps just log out) after installing new applications until this bug is fixed.\nLonger answer:\nI just installed Chromium today (nothing wrong with Firefox but I also need to use Chromium for work) and was frustrated because I couldn't get it to maximize on my second monitor! I could move it to the second monitor but if I hit the window-maximize button, it jumped to the main monitor (maximized). Because of the problems I described above (with PG Admin and Pidgin).\nI glanced at the launcher icon and saw that it didn't indicate that Chromium was running. Clicking the launcher opened a new Chromium window. On a whim I restarted the computer (maybe could have just logged out), and... both problems are solved! Chromium maximizes, and launcher knows it's running. I expect that it wouldn't have appeared in the switcher either, but forgot to try that.\nI left the Windows world 12 years ago and haven't looked back. One thing that's been nice with Linux is rarely having to reboot the computer to \"fix\" anything. But today it feels like I'm having a bad Windows flashback. Still trying to be patient with  Unity.\nSo it appears that there is a bug that only occurs for newly-installed programs. I don't know if it's something in the installer scripts or if Unity can be blamed for not discovering them, but I never had this problem with classic Gnome. I will follow up on this page once I install another GUI app and report whether this happens with every new app or just certain ones. I should probably also file a bug but I have a feeling it must have already been reported... if only I could find the right search terms.\n\nA: Try opening up the .desktop file and look for a line that says Type=Application.

Is there any way to fix this?\n\nA: It's almost certainly a connection issue and not mainly a distro issue, unless you have changed the DNS settings on your computer. I see you've already pinged profile.ak.fbcdn.net and that it won't respond, which is what to be expected. When you ping it, what IP adress does it resolve to? (I get 195.12.231.10). Does it resolve at all? If you don't get an IP adress, it's a problem with your DNS server. Try pinging the IP adress directly. Replace your primary DNS with this adress: 8.8.8.8, this is Googles DNS server.\nIf you do get a correct IP adress and it still does not respond to ping, then the problem is in your network. You need to eliminate eventual culprits like routers or switches, try using ethernet cables if you're using wifi and so on.\nIf you still can't ping this IP from a \"clean\" connection (no routers or anything at your house that can create this error) you need to contact your ISP and report a routing error.\n\nA: In my case I had a Firewall Blocking the network where the pictures live. The facebook pictures were serving up as blank rectangles with either red X's or a blue pic icon, but no picture. The picture servers seem to live in Ireland at a subset of fbcdn.net. I unblocked 31.13.0.0/16 outbound for both tcp ports 80 and 443. After this all of the pics showed up. \n\nA: I was encouraged to turn my comments into an answer by Beqa Arabuli and fossfreedom. I posted the solution first in the comments, but bigbadonk420 just put a similar answer. Nevertheless, because it was my idea initially it is legitimate to put another answer here.\n\nIt is most likely not an Ubuntu problem as you have changed browsers, reinstalled the OS and done everything that could reasonably be done. The fact that your ping to profile.ak.fbcdn.net is idle means that your are not resolving the address at all (the ping is not being silently blocked as I can ping it successfully). This means that it is probably a dns related issue; you can resolve facebook.com, but not all its content delivery networks (cdns). \nThat is why other internet sites are fine, but facebook is affected; there must be some kind of misconfiguration in your isp's dns records, or they are blocking the Facebook cdn for some reason. If they are using a transparent proxy perhaps the facebook cdns are getting swept up with that. Anyway, it is impossible to know the exact reason without contacting your isp. \nHowever, the best thing to do is to try an alternative dns; there are several alternatives, but probably the best is Google dns. More information is available from here; you need to set your primary dns as 8.8.8.8 and your secondary as 8.8.4.4 in your Ubuntu network settings and then reboot. You must make sure that your dns is not automatically being set to your original isp's dns. There are more instructions here relating to the setup of Google dns, but it is straightforward and should allow you to solve your problem without contacting your isp.\nGo to network-manager > select your connection > click edit and then select the ipv4 tab (if you are on ipv4 as most people are). The screenshot is below: change automatic dhcp to automatic (DHCP) addresses only and enter the dns details in the box provided:\n\n", "Q: Why did my upgrade to 12.04 fail with \"glibc not found\" or \"libc6\" or \"requires kernel 2.6.24\" error?

The reason can range from stability to just plain laziness. The problem is that the libc 2.15 included with Precise requires a minimum 2.6.24 kernel to function. Sometimes this will cause the release-upgrade to fail, but it is possible to complete and get into a partially upgraded neither-here-not-there situation like you have.\nFear not though, the libc requirement is a compile-time option, and it can be set lower (in which case the library includes workarounds for older kernels). I guess setting the minimum to .24 is one way to drag folks into 2012 :)\nI've set up a PPA containing a recompiled libc which will work on 2.6.18 or newer (please check uname -r!), and it should override the current libc provided by Precise. Just add ppa:izx/ovz-libc, update, and it should let you get past this. Specifically, something like this:\napt-add-repository ppa:izx/ovz-libc\napt-get update\napt-get -f install\ndo-release-upgrade\n\nand continue on until the upgrade completes successfully. I highly recommend NOT replacing any changed or non-existent config files.\nI will be keeping the ppa updated as and when libc is updated upstream. If you want to avoid a similar error when that happens, you may want to pin libc-bin to my PPA with a high priority, so it won't update until the \"fixed\" version is available from the PPA.\nHope this helps, and please post here if anyone has any questions or other feedback.\n\nA: For everybody stuck in the do-dist-upgrade and not being able to run\napt-add-repository ppa:izx/ovz-libc\n\nJust add following line manually to /etc/apt/sources.list:\ndeb http://ppa.launchpad.net/izx/ovz-libc/ubuntu lucid main\n\n\nA: I don't know if there exists another way but I had important files on my desktop that I did not back up when Ubuntu crashed on me in that exact fashion, I just so happened to have on hand the Ubuntu 11.10 Boot Multi-Option install CD and so I rebooted with the CD and then picked \"Upgrade from 12.04 LTS to 11.10\" and after how much time it spent re-installing 11.10 I am finally up and running again with my important files intact.\n", "Q: issue with dualboot 12.04 and windows 7 (with w7 loader) i have windows 7 installed (i install it first because for me it was always easier to have dual boot working) and i want to install 12.04 (i've tried 11.10 and 11.04 and i have the same problem) but i can't make dual boot works.\nWhen i install w7, the installer create an additional partition with the loader (i'm not sure what is in this partition because other installers didn't create it) so in sda1 is a small partition with the loader and in sda2 is the windows 7 partition.\nwhen i try to install Ubuntu, i create a partition for the / directory, one for the /home and one for swap.

So it will not destroy Windows booting (and MBR).\nLater to add Ubuntu to Windows boot menu create a \"boot sector loader\" and use \"dd for Windows\" to get a copy of Ubuntu partition boot record - see here, Section 8 how to do this.\n\nA: You have two options:\n\n\n*\n\n*when planning for dual booting with windows and ubuntu, you should\ninstall the ubuntu GRUB loader in windows boot loader partition. if\nyou fail to install the GRUB loader in windows partition,when you\nboot your pc windows 7 boot loader gets loaded.\nSo you wont get a chance to load your ubuntu.Now you install the\nGRUB in windows boot loader partition.

I would like to download ubuntu 12.04 LTS (64-bit). The iso file says \"ubuntu-12.040desktop-amd64.iso\" will it work with Intel Core2 Duo laptop?\n\nA: All Intel Core 2 Duo and Intel Core i3, i5 and i7 support either 32 Bit or 64 bit. You will not have a problem with this. With what you might have a problem is with the amount of memory you need. For 32 Bit the minimum for a good running system is 512MB, the maximum is 4GB. For 64Bit the minimum recommended is 2GB and the maximum is \"let your imagination fly!!!\". I have tested 64Bit versions on 1GB and they can run very slow sometimes. The more memory the better.\nIf your Core 2 Duo laptop has at least 4 GB of ram I would recommend 64 bit but since it is a laptop and the more memory you have in a 64 bit the better, I would recommend sticking with the 32 Bit version. You actually don't loose to try both but for your case I would go more with the 32 Bit version (Except if it is some kind of 4GB+ Ram Laptop).\n\nA: Yes\nThat is the ISO for the 64bit version. It should work fine\n\nA: If you got at least 2GB of RAM I highly suggest to go for the 64 bit installation. In theory it is faster than the 32 bit version. If you have 4GB or more than it is actually required to use all the available memory.\nIn the past there were some problems with 64 bit Ubuntu, mainly because lots of applications didn't support 64 bit yet. Nowadays however, the problems are mostly solved and I never experienced any problems running 64 bit Ubuntu. \n\nA: Yes.  I too have a laptop with an Intel Core2 Duo, and that's the file I used; it is running great!  That's the 64-bit version, and despite its name it works on Intel \nCPU's as well as on AMDs.\n\nA: I got 3 GB RAM on Core 2 duo laptop (old T61) and running 64-bit 12.04 LTS. It works absolutely fine until you run eclipse and web server. \nI am planning to revert to 32-bit.\n", "Q: Trouble making a Live USB with Debian 'Sqeeze' So first off, I'm using Debian sqeeze and I'm trying to make an Ubuntu 12. 04 Precise Pangolin Live USB. This is kind of a problem at the moment because debian does not have the \"startup disk creator\" app. So I looked through a number of debian forums and decided to try an app called unetbootin (apparently it's just about the only way I can make a live USB on Squeeze). I downloaded the iso file for 12.04, opened unetbootin and it extracted the files to the USB and everything was perfect. But when I reboot on my USB drive, the first thing on my screen is a unetbootin menu that only allows me to select \"default\". After I press enter it just loads a command prompt that starts with \"(initramfs):\" I can't figure out what I did wrong as I am a nub. Any Ideas or alternatives?\n\nA: You can also use dd.\nFirst, find out what the USB drive is called with sudo fdisk -l, then unmount it, then run\nsudo dd if=/path_to_iso/ubuntu-12.04-desktop-i386.iso of=/dev/sdX\n\nthe /dev/sdX part is whatever fdisk had shown, usually /dev/sdb or dev/sdc.\nExample\nHere is the output of sudo fdisk -l showing my USB drive:\nDisk /dev/sdc: 256 MB, 256900608 bytes\n60 heads, 27 sectors/track, 309 cylinders\nUnits = cylinders of 1620 * 512 = 829440 bytes\nSector size (logical/physical): 512 bytes / 512 bytes\nI/O size (minimum/optimal): 512 bytes / 512 bytes\nDisk identifier: 0x00040358\n\n   Device Boot      Start         End      Blocks   Id  System\n/dev/sdc1   *           1         310      250879    b  W95 FAT32\nPartition 1 has different physical/logical endings:\n     phys=(31, 59, 27) logical=(309, 43, 18)\n\nWhat we need is the device name, which in this case is /dev/sdc. You may have it designated differently,for example /dev/sdb or /dev/sdd (!/dev/sda is usually the hard drive, so don't use it!).\nLets assume that the ISO I want to write to that USB drive is in the Downloads folder in my home directory.\nsudo dd if=Downloads/ubuntu-12.04-desktop-i386.iso of=/dev/sdc\n\nThe command will write the contents of the ISO image to the USB device.\n\nA: Umm, a dd copy is probably the worst idea for booting a livecd from a usb drive. In all seriousness, unetbootin probably just isn't keeping up with the casper scripts update, and forgot a line in the boot list. If you give unetbootin one more chance, but when it's done mount the partition it used, and go into the syslinux folder. Look for a syslinux.cfg, and look for the entry list that starts with LABEL default. On the append line, make sure it has boot=casper and cdrom-detect/try-usb=true. Without those two lines, it will not boot.\n(Ex. APPEND initrd=initrd.img boot=casper cdrom-detect/try-usb=true ro splash --)\n", "Q: Is there a way to delete Windows 7 from my harddisk without having to completely reinstall Ubuntu? I had Windows 7 installed on my machine, then installed Ubuntu completely separate (didn't use Wubi), and now I would like to remove Windows without erasing my harddisk and reinstalling Ubuntu. Is there a way to do this? (I am currently running Ubuntu 12.04)\n\nA: Since you evidently have Windows and Ubuntu installed into separate partitions, the easiest way to get rid of Windows is probably to open GParted and reformat - or delete - just the partition containing Windows.  This will not affect your Ubuntu intallation, so there will be no need to reinstall it.  When you reboot, run\nsudo update-grub\n\nto make sure that it is updated to no longer show an option of booting into Windows 7.\nSo, after having done these things, you'll have a partition that used to contain Windows, and another that still contains Ubuntu.  Now, if you want to make it all one partition, you'll need to boot from the LiveCD so that you can run GParted on the Ubuntu partition, too.  You can choose to move the Ubuntu partition to the left (because it is likely your Windows partition was one of the first partitions) and expand it to include the entire hard drive.\n\nA: have you tried opening the disk utility .... hit start type disk press enter .... find the disk .....find the win 7 partition on the disk ....delete/reformat the PARTITION, not the Volume. (It wont/shouldnt let you format the vol when your running it anyway) ....then reformat the partition to ext4 and extend your disc ....or just set it to auto mount and use it for file storage ....Its proly safer to keep the partitions separate anyway in case something happens to one you wont lose the other ....I prefer keeping my OS on a partition and all the files on another on the same disc ....this way i yank or break my OS whenever I want without worrying about my precious content.... Its the way safer way to go .\nAlternatively mount the windows partition use sudo and -R (recursive) and delete the contents and just use the disk as normal \n", "Q: Ubiquity crashes during install So I have been trying to install 12.04 On my desktop since alpha 2 which is an old HP with 1 gig of RAM an AMD xp 2400+ and an nVidia geforce 5200 fx. The installer has always crashed at the same spot it crashes right as the slide show is supposed to start. and leaves my computer bricked. I figured it would be fixed by now for release but it hasn't. I REALLY want 12.04 just to use gnome classic but with new software. \n\nA: I would recommend to run the installer from the command line and possibly disable the migration assistant (an application, which tries to move your documents from other OSs to the newly installed Ubuntu - I remember that in the past it has been a source of similar problems)\nubiquity --no-migration-assistant\n\nAlso, do not download the updates during the installation (to narrow down the problem). And see what happens, check the logs (most importantly /var/log/syslog) ... and search for their causes...\n", "Q: Internet doesn't work by default After upgrading to Precise, I am required to run 'sudo dhclient eth0' in a terminal in order to get the internet to work. Everything worked perfectly fine on Oneiric, so It's really puzzling me. \nI'm thinking it could possibly be something with the kernel, but who knows.\n\nOutput of dmesg:\n[    0.247891] system 00:01:

Just installed Ubuntu 12.04, then I did \nsudo apt-get install gnome-shell\n\nand windows have only a close button, how can I enable minimize / maximize? The old gconf-editor doesn't seem to work cause it has the three buttons in the config.\n\nA: You need gnome tweak tool.\nClick the Download button to install with Ubuntu Software Center:\n\n\nOr you can install in Terminal:\nsudo apt-get update; sudo apt-get install gnome-tweak-tool\n\nThen open Advanced Settings to change the minimize and maximize buttons.\n\nA: Install dconf-editor:\nsudo apt-get install dconf-tools\ndconf-editor\n\nThen navigate to: \norg.gnome.shell.overrides >> button-layout\n\nand set value to: \nclose,minimize,maximize: **OR** :maximize, minimize,close\n\nNote that you might also perform this from console: \ngsettings set org.gnome.shell.overrides button-layout close,minimize,maximize: \n\nIn current versions of Gnome, you may need to use this instead:\ngsettings set org.gnome.desktop.wm.preferences button-layout 'close,minimize,maximize:'\n\n\nA: I had the same problem where my Ubuntu 12.04 windows only showed the close button. I realize that it is possible to right click on the menu bar to get the missing minimize and maximize functionality but I wanted the buttons back.\nI was going to install Ubuntu Tweak but found the \"Advanced Settings\" application. I just went to the \"Shell\" tab and set \"Arrangement of buttons on the titlebar\" from \"Close Only\" to \"All\". This restored the missing buttons onto my windows.\nI hope this alternate solution helps people with the same problem.\n\nA: I found this page when I was looking for an answer to this question. Thought some people would appreciate this information. \nHere is the terminal command for those that are two lazy to open a link. Just wanted to give credit to the original contributor of this information. \ngconftool -s /apps/metacity/general/button_layout -t string menu:minimize,maximize,close \n\n\nA: For Ubuntu 14.04+, you might need to run the following:\ngsettings set org.gnome.settings-daemon.plugins.xsettings overrides \"{'Gtk/DecorationLayout': <':minimize,maximize,close'>}\"\n\n\nA: On 12.04 and 14.04, the answer given by @user161127 worked well for me (entering the following in the terminal)\ngsettings set org.gnome.shell.overrides button-layout ':minimize,maximize,close'\n\nHowever, on 16.04, I needed to use the path given by @JivanAmara instead:\ngsettings set org.gnome.desktop.wm.preferences button-layout ':minimize,maximize,close'\n\n\nA: This is very simple guys, just type the following command in the terminal, it worked for me:\ngsettings set  org.gnome.shell.overrides button-layout ':minimize,maximize,close'\n\nIn Ubuntu 17.10 (and Debian 9 Stretch) with gnome 3.26.1 command is:\ngsettings set org.gnome.desktop.wm.preferences button-layout ':minimize,maximize,close'\n\n(thanks to Ohto Nordberg's reply).\n\nA: Install ubuntu tweak.Open ubuntu tweak and go to Tweaks>Window and set \"off\" in Close button only . But I didn't like this type of solution though I'm sharing this solution.\n\nA: To maximise, you can instead double-click on the window frame with the left button. To minimise, single-click the middle button on the window frame.\n\nA: I ran into this after installing Gnome 40 where I lost the Firefox Minimize and maximize buttons.  Up above, user wojox gave the command line tools for the Gnome Shell.  This was important because Tweaks no longer works.  In his/her answer, I failed to note the difference between the leading ':' and trailing ':' in the string.  The trailing ':' moves the buttons to the left side of the menubar and the leading ':' puts them on the right side.\nThe choice is yours.\nThe simple command line solution (take note of ':' placement):\nThis gives right buttons\ngsettings set org.gnome.desktop.wm.preferences button-layout ':minimize,maximize,close'\n\nThis gives left buttons\ngsettings set org.gnome.desktop.wm.preferences button-layout 'minimize,maximize,close:'\n\nYou can also use the dconf editor. Note that dconf-editor is now its own package and there is no dconf-tools.\nInstall dconf-editor:\nsudo apt-get install dconf-editor\ndconf-editor\n\nThen navigate to:\norg.gnome.desktop.wm.preferences >> button-layout\nand set value to:\nclose,minimize,maximize: OR :maximize, minimize,close\n\nA: As an alternative to the buttons, you can still minimize/maximize windows by right-clicking on their titlebar and selecting the appropriate entry from the menu.\n\nA: In Gnome tweak tool --> click on Shell in left column and then in right column for Arrangement of buttons in title bar select \"all\", instead of\"close only\".\n\nA: The dconf-tool editor solutions described by vanlong441 and by Todd Partridge worked for me. The only thing to add is you can change the side of the buttons on the window by moving the : in the string, and change the order of the buttons by moving their names around. (Useful for personal preference and also pranking).\n\nA: In Ubuntu Gnome 17.04 use \ndconf-editor\n\nto open the Editor and you can find it here:\n\n\nA: in lubuntu to show minimize maximize buttons to title bar of windows\nsudo apt install `dconf-editor`\ndconf-editor\n\nctrl+L & type to path:\n/org/gnome/desktop/wm/preferences/button-layout\n\nthen use default value on\nand type menu:minimize,maximize,spacer,close to show minimize maximize buttons to windows\n\nA: To right align buttons, put the colon in the beginning:\ngsettings set org.gnome.shell.overrides button-layout :minimize,maximize,close\n\n", "Q: Unresponsive/Laggy Dash with an Intel video card that shows up as \"Unknown\" I did a clean install of Ubuntu 12.04 about three hours ago. Now I've been installing all the programs I use, etc...\nHowever, I seem to be having a problem with a VERY laggy dash, to the point where it's almost completely unresponsive. When I open the dash and search for a program like Firefox, as I type Firefox the letters come about a second after I push the key, and the whole system starts to freeze up. When I try to highlight a program I recently used the mouse literally skips across the screen as if the screen cant keep up with it. Is anyone else having similar problems? Also, I know this is a longshot, but could any programs I have installed slow down my system? I'd love to get this sorted out, because it's a pain to have such an unresponsive menu, and I really don't want to use Gnome 3.4. \nThe problem is it doesn't \"know\" what my graphics driver is. Which is clearly a problem, how can I fix this? \n\nAccording to Ubuntu 11.10 I had Intel Ironlake Mobile Graphics, according to this I have nothing.

Surprisingly the solution for me was to activate KDE Compatibility -> Blur support in CCSM. You can also try to disable blur or change it to static (ubuntu unity plugin  -> experimental -> dash blur).\nTo install CompizConfig Setting Manager type/copy into terminal:\nsudo apt-get install compizconfig-settings-manager\n\nPlease, be very careful with this tool, it can really break your system.\nI hope this will help with your problem.\nGood luck.\n\nA: This worked for me: first, install Compiz Config settings Manager (CCSM) and then, go to OpenGL and veryfy the checkbox for \"Sync to vBlank\" is checked. \nI also enabled KDE compatibility but windows controls dissapeared in fullscreen. (so, don't enable it)\nGood luck!\n\nA: Open a Terminal window (Ctrl+Alt+T) and type:\nsudo apt-get install mesa-utils\n\nAfter that's done, close Terminal and reopen details/sysinfo.\nIt's not that it doesn't recognize it. Ubuntu 12.04 just doesn't come with mesa-utils installed by default anymore.\n\nA: What version did you install?  Seems the 64bit version needs more RAM.\nAlso, you can try Kubuntu or Xubuntu, which are more or less the same as the base Ubuntu, with different GUIs.\nhttps://wiki.ubuntu.com/PrecisePangolin/TechnicalOverview/Beta1#Kubuntu\nFor more feedback, we'll need your full system information please.\n\nA: Same problem here.\nI tried enabling KDE compatibility. Indeed the lag was gone but instead the upper left window buttons were not displayed in full screen mode.\n", "Q: Duplicate grub menu in Ubuntu 12.04 I have a problem with my laptop grub menu. duplicate menu appears as below:\n\nFound linux image: /boot/vmlinuz-3.2.0-24-generic\nFound initrd image: /boot/initrd.img-3.2.0-24-generic\nFound linux image: /boot/vmlinuz-3.2.0-24-generic\nFound initrd image: /boot/initrd.img-3.2.0-24-generic\n\nhow to remove duplicates?

Just upgraded to 12.04 from 11.04, using the default Unity desktop. I don't seem to be getting anything from the Messaging indicator applet. I'm running all the default things that I installed this morning: Thunderbird 11.01 with Global Menu Bar Integration 3.2 and Messaging Menu and Unity Integration 0.9.3. I go Preferences -> When new message arrives -> Show an alert, Play Sound. But nothing happens. No sound, no notification, no change in color of the Messaging indicator, but Thunderbird clearly shows new messages. I tried installing notification-daemon but that didn't do anything either, even after another restart. Any suggestions?\n\nA: I have recently gotten these notifications to work. I'm not sure if this will work for everyone. I'm also not sure if this is a bug or not. It seems more like an oversight of forgotten software that should be installed by default. I installed the following packages to get everything (sound, bubble, messaging indicator) to work:\nsudo apt-get install notification-daemon esound python-notify\n\nGood luck to everyone else having problems with this!\n", "Q: Does the new \"privacy\" button have a log? I was just wondering if there was a log that shows exactly what the various applications are taking a history of?\n\nA: The is no \"log\" in the sense of a human readable text file, as this information is stored by Zeitgeist. What you can do however, is install Gnome-Activity-Journal, which will give you a read out of everything it has stored in the database.\n\n", "Q: Keyboard not working on boot I have read other related threads, but none quite seem like this. I upgrade to 12.04 today and every time I boot, the keyboard stops working. It works in grub and bios, but as soon as I am to the login screen, the keyboard looks like it isn't even running with the numlock key not lit up. The only way to fix this is to unplug and replug the keyboard. It is a USB keyboard, though I also have a separate USB mouse that works fine.\n\nA: Try to boot into recovery mode and run dpkg\n", "Q: 12.04 Freezing Up I'm using a new AO722 (acer aspire), new usb and ubuntu is booting into both the desktop and the installer but after a minute everything freezes. I checked the md5sum, using the 32bit iso. Not sure of anything else I can provide.\n\nA: You seen this page on the Ubuntu site?:\nhttps://wiki.ubuntu.com/X/Troubleshooting/Freeze\nI've had this issue before; the symptoms I saw were the UI would lock up, but the mouse could still move around.  Either that or the computer wouldn't be able to wake up (the screen would stay black).  All of this happened at random intervals, and before the lockup, everything else was operational.  From other answers I've seen on this, it's usually a Graphics driver issue?\n\nA: Its a wifi/Lan issue. You have to set the boot order to boot from the network. Then enable network boot in the bios.\n", "Q: Ubuntu 11.10 not suspending automatically New:\nAfter digging around a bit more, I found out the problem is much more that the system is not suspending on its own, although suspending manually (shutdown->suspend) works well.\nI used the suspend after 5 mins setting on both ac and power from the power settings menu.\nThe only \"solution\" I could find for that problem was linked from another thread :\nhttp://thecodecentral.com/2011/01/18/fix-ubuntu-10-10-suspendhibernate-not-working-bug \nDid not work for me.\nOld:\nIf I manually (with gconf-editor) set sleep-inactive-timeout to another value other than the 5/10/3/1 from the power manager, the settings will be ignored (= no suspending at all).\nI set it to 10 and waited 20 seconds.

Anyway, I noticed while using my disk as live cd that you could change the size of the launcher icons. Now that it is installed on this computer, I don't have that option... I can only change whether the launcher auto-hides or not.\nHaving a problem with xscreensaver as well, but directed that to xscreensaver.\nCould this just be that the upgrade didn't go well?

If just one window of a relatively simple application, such as Gnome Terminal, is opened and moved around, the movement is sometimes very choppy, but the rest of the time it's perfectly smooth. The times when it's choppy seem to be when part of the window goes off the bottom or right side of the screen. Also, if there are multiple windows open, it is almost always choppy. These facts suggest to me that it's something to do with the compositor.\nUnity works perfectly smoothly. Memory usage is only at about 500-600MB, out of 3GB, even with a few things open. The graphics card is the on-board Intel graphics on the Core i5 M450.\nDoes anyone have any ideas what might be causing this problem?\n\nA: I have found a partial solution to the problem.\nIt would seem that the root of the problem lies somewhere in mutter or the Intel driver, or a dependency. From https://bbs.archlinux.org/viewtopic.php?pid=1092628, a workaround is to put the following in /etc/environment (or somewhere else which gets \"sourced\" before things are run):\nCLUTTER_PAINT=disable-clipped-redraws:disable-culling\n\nFor me, this makes Gnome 3.4 pretty usable, but still a bit worse than 3.2 in terms of performance.

This is how I solved it (parts only in German, sorry; try e.g. Google Translate):\n\n\n*\n\n*chroot:\nhttp://wiki.ubuntuusers.de/chroot/Live-CD\n\n*Look for the post of bowman Mai 2011 12:52:\nhttp://forum.ubuntuusers.de/topic/daten-retten-mit-live-cd-2/#post-2922047\n\n*Run the following commands in a Terminal:\nsudo apt-get clean\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo dpkg --configure -a\nsudo apt-get -f install\nsudo apt-get upgrade\nsudo apt-get dist-upgrade\nsudo apt-get install --reinstall ubuntu-desktop\n\nThis did the trick.\n\nA: Perhaps there's a problem with your desktop environment (or LightDM). IDK which desktop you are running (Perhaps you should add this to your question), so I'm going to assume your running the default one, Unity (aka ubuntu-desktop).\nI would try reinstalling both the desktop and LightDM. You can do this by entering a TTY terminal (CTRL+alt+F1 for TTY1, CTRL+alt+F2 for TTY2, etc. CTRL+alt+F7 to return to your desktop). Login, and run:\nsudo apt-get clean\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get install lightdm ubuntu-desktop --reinstall\n\nFrom there, I would reboot, and see if that fixes the problem.\nIf you're using some other desktop, you should be able to replace ubuntu-desktop with the name of your prefered desktop.\n\nA: This is just a generic suggestion and I have no idea whether it will actually help solve your problem or not. But I think it is where I would (try to) start if something like this happened to me. \n\n\n*\n\n*See if you can boot Ubuntu in recovery mode. Your Grub menu should look something like this:\n\n    Ubuntu, with Linux 3.2.0-23-generic\n    Ubuntu, with Linux 3.2.0-23-generic (recovery mode)\n    Memory test (memtest86+)\n    Memory test (memtest86+, serial console 115200)\n\nSelect to boot using (recovery mode).\nNote: If a GRUB menu is not displayed when you boot Linux, press and hold the Shift key immediately after the system starts booting. This should bring up the GRUB menu.\n\n\n*If you booted in recovery mode, your root (`/`) partition will be read-only. Select/run the option fsck Check all file systems in the recovery menu.  \n\nIf this completes successfully, your install partition will be remounted as read/write allowing you to make changes to your files. (If it does not succeed, then something is wrong with your files.)\n\n\n*Select the recovery menu option to Enable networking.\n\n\n*Assuming the above all went well, select the recovery menu option to  \n\nRepair broken packages\n\n*Let it run to completion, then reboot. Hopefully this will fix things in your install.\n\n", "Q: I can't connect to internet with a BCM4312 This is my first time with Linux (I am using Ubuntu 12.04) and i am having trouble connecting to

I've noticed that Ctrl+Alt+Numpad moves a window around to fill bits of the screen, but it seems to be missing three shortcuts: Ctrl+Alt+Num4 to fill the left, Ctrl+Alt+Num6 to fill the right, and some sort of keyboard shortcut to move a window from one monitor to the other (like Super+Shift+Right or Super+Shift+Left in Windows 7). Can I somehow make these three keyboard shortcuts work?\nEdit: Found out Ctrl+Super+Left and Ctrl+Super+Right to fill the left and right halves of the screen, but still no way to move a window between monitors.\n\nA: It sounds like you want to use the compiz config settings tool. You can install it with\nsudo apt-get install compizconfig-settings-manager\n\nBy typing that command in a terminal. You can then launch the application in unity; just start typing the word comiz and you'll see it.\nThere's lots of fun options to play around with in here. The one that you probably want to look at is the grid tool. Just remember if you manage to damage something and cause unity to stop working, typing\nunity --reset\n\nIn a terminal and this will reset the profile to default and revert your changes. \n\nA: You can change or add keyboard shortcut with the System Settings with the Keyboard function, Shortcuts tab.\n", "Q: How to upgrade from 32bit Wubi to 64bit Wubi?

This should normally by handled properly when upgrading both.\nIf you don't understand your phpmyadmin configuration or didn't set it up yourself, some issues with phpmyadmin's configuration in Debian/Ubuntu can be overcome by purging and reinstalling the phpmyadmin package, or perhaps simply with sudo dpkg-reconfigure phpmyadmin.\n\nA: You may reconfigure phpmyadmin, and reset MySQL password.\n\n\n*\n\n*Ctrl + Alt + T to launch terminal\n\n*sudo dpkg-reconfigure phpmyadmin\n\n*Connection method for MySQL database for phpmyadmin: unix socket\n\n*Name of the database's administrative user: root\n\n*Password of the database's administrative user: mysqlsamplepassword\n\n*MySQL username for phpmyadmin: root\n\n*MySQL database name for phpmyadmin: phpmyadmin\n\n*Web server to reconfigure automatically: apache2\n\n*ERROR 1045\n\n*ignore\n\n*sudo dpkg-reconfigure mysql-server-5.5\n\n*New password for the MySQL \"root\" user: mysqlsamplepassword\n\n*Repeat password for the MySQL \"root\" user: mysqlsamplepassword\n\n\nWish it helps!\nHave a nice day!\n\nA: If you upgraded mysql-server, you are probably suffering a broken package that has recently release in the precise repo.\n\nA: In my case, resetting new password without white space characters worked for both phpmyadmin and mysql on Ubuntu 14.04 LTS.\nIt seems phpmyadmin could not use white space character in their password field and feels like dejavu on early days of Ubuntu 12.04 LTS which also could not log in to phpmyadmin due to having white space characters on mysql password. Do note that mysql is capable having white space characters in its password, though. :D \n\nA: The problem was that the /etc/mysql/my.cnf was writable by another user than 'root'. So during the installation of mysql, the file was ignored and the installation didn't worked well.\nA simple :\nchmod 644 /etc/mysql/my.cnf\naptitude remove mysql-server\naptitude install mysql-server\naptitude install mysql-common\n\nDid the job very well after all.\nAptitude is, in my opinion, much better than apt-get.

Try this directory /home/userdir/.gconf/system/networking/connections If not, then it might just be in /home/userdir/.conf/system/networking/connections.

I can login to terminal with Ctrl-Alt-F5 and I did startx but it hangs after displaying white images of the desktop icons..there is no menu or any top bar at all. I guess this problem has something to do with Xserver, but I cannot find xorg.conf on my system.\nHow can I get around this problem? Also is there a way I can make a backup of my files through the command line, because the GUI is not showing up at all?\n\nA: First up all boot with a live cd or usb (if it is available) and back up all your files.It seems that the  problem u have is related to the graphics driver.And another suggestion is that u run the recovery mode from the boot menu and fix any broken issues then come back to the normmal mode.Pls go through the known issues of this release too as your system specification has not provided. https://wiki.ubuntu.com/PrecisePangolin/ReleaseNotes/UbuntuDesktop\n\nA: There might be many reasons for that.

In 11.10 Windows Live accounts worked perfectly (I suppose Empathy was 3.2.*), but now in 12.04, it's 3.4.1 and the account I had was lost. It doesn't seem to have an option to add new Windows Live accounts, though. Here's what Empathy's option window looks like:\n\nSo, did I forget to install anything, or do I need some kind of workaround? Or even, how can I downgrade back to Empathy 3.2.* if it's the only way to make this work?\n\nA: I found that telepathy-butterfly, the package that allowed this in empathy has been replaced by telepathy-haze. Installing telepathy-haze solved this for me. \nsudo apt-get install telepathy-haze\n\nhttps://launchpad.net/ubuntu/precise/amd64/telepathy-butterfly\n\nA: I finally got that to work. Now, all online accounts are managed in \"System configuration > Online Accounts\". I have tried to go to System configuration (configuración del sistema) and haven't find that. So, how to get there? \nWhen adding an account to Empathy (with F4, for example), in the down-right corner there is an option called \"Edit conexion parameters...\". That leads you to the \"Online Accounts\" option, and there, you can add a Windows Live account. Once you have added your hotmail account, it will appear automatically on Empathy. \nHope this will help you. \n\nA: Try installing an additional plugin from the Software Center. I think the following Empathy add-on will work: Telepathy-butterfly.\nYou can find a list of plugins on the Empathy Software Center page.\n\nA: No, they're still all supported out of the box in 12.04 – and supposed to work. \n", "Q: Upgrade to 12.04, first boot stuck on Checking Battery State I upgraded my 11.10 to 12.04 but it stuck on the first boot.

How can I do it? Thanks. If it's not possible, how can I access folder in the fastest way? How do you do it?\n\nA: You can use the way described by darkdragn. \nThis way you can add your own quick menues. You find a complete guide to that method here: http://maketecheasier.com/8-really-useful-ubuntu-unity-quicklists/2011/05/07 (and on a lot of other pages)\n\nA: What you can do is to create a bash shell script executes the application you want with the file as the argument to be opened. Save that script in /usr/local/bin and permit execution. Then create a launcher that executes your script. Here's an example where I decrypt a file display it with leafpad and when leafpad is terminated, delete the created file.\n#!/bin/bash\n#Decrypt notecase\ngpg -o ~/Bin/.notecase -d ~/WIP/notecase.txt.gpg\nleafpad ~/Bin/.notecase\nrm ~/Bin/.notecase\n\nThe following is the launcher file I created by editing a copy of system notecase.desktop file.

The upgrade completed without any errors.\nSince then, I am unable to access any of the applications in the Dash. The Dash seems to be empty. When I search for some application like gedit, it says \"Sorry, there is nothing that matches your search\".\nIs there any way to fix it? \n\nA: I just encountered this problem earlier today on my laptop. It surprised me, given that I couldn't think of any reason it didn't show up until now.\nAfter some struggling, I eventually resolved the issue by opening a terminal (Ctrl+Alt+T if you don't already have it pinned to the launcher) and using unity --replace &. (You could probably also do this with Unity's Alt+F2 prompt, but it too went missing for me at the time.)\n\nA: I experienced this problem on 11.10 and solved it by installing unity-place-applications and unity-place-files\n\nA: None of these fixes worked for me. But after more searching:\nrm ~/.cache/software-center -R\n\nworked like a charm. I did need to run:\nunity --reset &\n\nafterwards though, for the changes to take effect within dash, but the software center just started working straightaway.\n\nA: You should ensure that you have these 2 packages installed:\n\n\n*\n\n*For 12.10 and older:\n\n\n*\n\n*unity-place-applications \n\n*unity-place-files \n\n\n*For newer versions: \n\n\n*\n\n*unity-lens-applications\n\n*unity-lens-files\nThen logout/login and you will get back you the 2 lenses and the search will search applications and files.\n\nA: In my case none of the solutions above worked.\nThe solution I found:\nrm -rf ~/.local/share/zeitgeist\n\nThen close your session and login again, and dash worked again.\n\nA: Same here. After upgrading from 11.04 to 11.10 to 12.04 (beta2) the DASH menu doesn't list any applications. Previously typing \"calc\" for example would list the calculator and LibreOffice Calc. Now, nothing shows up, neither in the main DASH window, nor in the application lens. \nHowever, in the main lens songs (FLAC) do show up, but for instance documents don't. Furthermore, I have regular crashes of unity-lens-video. Apport told me this problem had already been reported.

The fans still run and the screen is still on, etc. I have to hold down the power button in order to complety shut down. \nDoes anyone know how to resolve this problem?\n\nA: Another possible solution - especially for newer hardware using (U)EFI - is to add the boot parameter apm=power_off. You can add it to the definition of GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT in /etc/default/grub or add the line if it does not exist yet.\nGRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT=\"apm=power_off\"\n\nThen update the grub installation according to your operating systems manual, e.g: update-grub or grub2-mkconfig -o /boot/efi/EFI/[osname]/grub2.cfg or similar.\n\nA: I have the same problem and found a solution which worked out for me.\nType in terminal:\n\n*\n\n*EDITOR=gedit sudoedit /etc/default/grub\n\n*Find the line: GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT=\"quiet splash\"\n\n*Change this to: GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT=\"quiet splash acpi=force\"\n\n*Save the file and close the file.\n\n*Finally, in terminal: sudo update-grub\n\n*exit  (to end the root shell)\n\nI found it here: Dell Studio 1569 Cannot Shutdown in Ubuntu 11.10 or 12.04\n\nA: It is a bug. Ref - https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/linux/+bug/987933\n\nA: The key may be in this  sentence, \"it kills all running processes\". In my case, it did NOT! The problem was caused by the redis-server process which, for some reason, couldn't be stopped normally. Once I killed all redis-serverprocesses, sudo killall redis-server, I was able to do shut down normally. Since I don't need redis that often, I stopped it from running at startup with these commands:\n\nsudo update-rc.d -f redis-server remove\nsudo update-rc.d -f redis_6379 remove \n\nI will wait for an update that fixes this  problem, but for now I will  remember to stop the redis process before shutting down.\nIt may not be redis in your case, but it's likely a buggy process that Ubuntu couldn't kill.\nThis may help you inspect the problem:\n\n\n*\n\n*service --status-all: lists all services registered with the system. Services that start with OS boot will have a [+] symbol before them.\n\n*Read the log messages that appear on the screen when you press the power button to manually power off. In my case, I read something about trying to close the redis server. The messages may also appear if you press some random keys.\n\n*Review the programs you installed recently, maybe one of them is causing the problem.\n\n*Try closing all unnecessary   processes and see if you can shut down normally. If you can, repeat the process, narrowing down the candidates, till you reach the buggy app.\n\nA: I encountered the same thing with Ubuntu 18.04, the solution above did not work for me and I end up updating the kernel to 5.03\nsudo apt install --install-recommends linux-generic-hwe-18.04\n\nAnd then reboot.\n\nA: After installing windows 10 on a different partition I had the same issue. Even after removing windows and creating a new partition table in that drive didn’t solve the problem (I thought it could be something windows installer wrote to the drive’s MBR).

I installed 12.04 RC a few days before the release date and it is now updated fully.

Should I untick Unsupported updates (precise-backports) since I now want a relatively stable user experience (although I run sudo apt-get update and sudo apt-get upgrade quite a few times a day and that hasn't been a problem at all.)\n\nA: This is not necessary.  If you run\napt-cache policy | grep backports\n\nyou'll see that the Backports repository is pinned to 100.  This means that you have to explicitly choose to install the backport version of a package if a version also exists in the non-backports repository.  The advantage this has, is that if a package is only available in backports, you'll be able to install it without modifying anything else.\n\nA: I was confused and concerned about this too.\nI must admit, I'm not a fan of this, even if it's setup in a way such that a backport can never supersede a official packages. Especially as this is an LTS, I see two issues with this:\n\n\n*\n\n*Bad branding, bad first experience - I think almost any user who first comes across this tab will think, \"Oh no, scary unsupported updates are somehow enabled on my super stable Ubuntu 12.04 LTS!\"\n\n*The default is to let users unknowingly install unsupported software of possibly poor quality - I doubt it's clear in the Software Center whether a package is only in backports or not. We want the user to trust the Software Center. The default settings should have a strong social contract: \"Everything you install from here is high-quality and trustworthy\". Of course, a user might add PPAs, and then the contract has changed. But the default should be safe and reassuring.\nI'm a Debian greybeard, and when I saw this, I immediately thought it was a bug. I unchecked it, and then used synaptic to make sure nothing was installed from backports.\nHonestly, I'd like the backports checkbox to be removed. PPAs are a much better, fined-grained way for someone to install unsupported software, should they want to.\n", "Q: Just Installed 11.10 on a PC that had problems with 9 - First Run, Screens going black Last time I had ubuntu on this PC the screen would go black every few seconds and stay black for a bit, that was running 9, now I've upgraded to 11.10 hoping that would fix the issue, but the issue still seems to remain, only it's not as bad as it was with 9. \nI can at least ask for help this time around.

Gonna try a restart... \nI'd rather not go through that bloody hassle again.  Based on my experience with the radeon 12 hours ago: getting the drivers from NVIDIA, starting up without xorg, purging the drivers that are there and planting the NVIDIA drivers in will be what I need to do: unless some one has a simpler way that isn't going to tank my nice fresh install, but if there's no nicer way, please let me know what packages I'm going to need to purge. \nIt's not blacking out now... But I still don't trust it.   Going to install chrome because I can trust it's about://gpu data to tell me if my gfx card is working fully or not. \nGLTron is running, so openGL that's a good sign, and jockey just jumped up and said it's activated a recommended driver - looks like I was fretting over nothing.

It sounds from your question like you're getting a crash report to submit data to Mozilla.org, rather than to Launchpad. That suggests that you're not running the version of Firefox that comes with Ubuntu. If the following advice doesn't solve your problem, you should edit your question to provide the output of the following commands in the Terminal:\napt-cache policy firefox\nfirefox -v\nwhich -a firefox\n\nA Simple Fix That Often Works\nHowever, you may simply be able to solve this problem by clearing out your Firefox profile. To do this, make sure Firefox is not running. Then, if you do not use other Mozilla applications such as Thunderbird, run this command:\nmv ~/.mozilla ~/.mozilla.old\n\nAlternatively, if you do use other Mozilla applications such as Thunderbird, run this command:\nmv ~/.mozilla/firefox ~/.mozilla/firefox.old\n\nThen run Firefox and see if the problem is fixed. You won't have your bookmarks, cache, cookies, saved passwords, and other data, but it's likely that Firefox will be repaired.\nThis technique doesn't actually delete your user-specific Firefox data; instead, it moves it out of the way so Firefox doesn't use it.\nTo restore it--which would break Firefox again, if this fixed it--first make sure Firefox is not running. Then do this if you followed the first method:\nmv ~/.mozilla ~/.mozilla.new\nmv ~/.mozilla.old ~/.mozilla\n\nOr this if you followed the second method:\nmv ~/.mozilla/firefox ~/.mozilla/firefox.new\nmv ~/.mozilla/firefox.old ~/.mozilla/firefox\n\n\nA: If you want you can install Chromium for web browsing. Just open a terminal (Ctrl+Alt+T) and type:\nsudo apt-get install chromium-browser\n\nPress Enter and you'll be asked for your password. As you type it, it won't appear on the screen, but that's fine. Then press enter. If you're then asked if you really want to install, press y and Enter.\n", "Q: Second monitor on NVidia card cannot detect proper resolution A friend had given me one of his extra monitors, and even in Windows it gave me trouble in producing the right resolutions. I switched back to Ubuntu with the release of Pangolin but can't get it to work as a second monitor.\nThe monitor is a ViewSonic VX2235WM and supposed to operate at 1680x1050. It is plugged into the second (VGA) port of my NVidia 9400GT 1GB. I tried playing with xrandr and cvt, and while I can seemingly get modeline information for the desired resolution, I can't get it to acknowledge this as a resolution.\nAfter trying cvt and xrandr, I kicked around in nvidia-settings, to no avail. I attempted replacing my (empty) default xorg.conf with a fresh one put together by nvidia-xconfig, but it too has given me no headway.\nNot sure what other information you would need, here is my xorg.conf:\n# nvidia-xconfig: X configuration file generated by nvidia-xconfig\n# nvidia-xconfig:  version 295.40  (buildmeister@swio-display-x86-rhel47-06.nvidia.com)  Thu Apr  5 22:40:54 PDT 2012\n\nSection \"ServerLayout\"\n    Identifier     \"Layout0\"\n    Screen      0  \"Screen0\"\n    InputDevice    \"Keyboard0\" \"CoreKeyboard\"\n    InputDevice    \"Mouse0\" \"CorePointer\"\nEndSection\n[... took out the InputDevice sections to make it all fit...]\nSection \"Monitor\"\n    Identifier     \"Monitor0\"\n    VendorName     \"Unknown\"\n    ModelName      \"Unknown\"\n    HorizSync       28.0 - 65.0\n    VertRefresh     43.0 - 72.0\n    Option         \"DPMS\"\n    Modeline       \"1680x1050\" 119.00 1680 1728 1760 1840 1050 1053 1059 1080 +hsync -vsync\nEndSection\n\nSection \"Device\"\n    Identifier     \"Device0\"\n    Driver         \"nvidia\"\n    VendorName     \"NVIDIA Corporation\"\n    Option         \"ModeValidation\" \"NoMaxPClkCheck\"\nEndSection\n\nSection \"Screen\"\n    Identifier     \"Screen0\"\n    Device         \"Device0\"\n    Monitor        \"Monitor0\"\n    DefaultDepth    24\n    SubSection     \"Display\"\n        Depth       24\n    EndSubSection\nEndSection\n\nI made two changes to it based on suggestions found here and other places on the internet; The modeline is mine, the ModeValidation option in Device is mine, and I upped the HorizSync just in case.

I tried killing processes related to ttf-mscorefonts-installer via htop (both SIGTERM and SIGKILL) which did not work for me. I did some further digging and found that I had neglected to hit the Tab, which highlights OK and allows the Enter key to continue the process as outlined here. I felt pretty stupid until I realized that it would have been extremely simple to include the words \"Hit tab and then enter to accept\" on the page that requests acceptance. I have no doubt that making this small adjustment would eliminate a great deal of frustration.\n\nA: I've got the exact same issue, the upgrade hung off while downloading ms-core-fonts from sourceforge. After 2 hours waiting for the process to continue, I decided to kill the process downloading the package.\nSo I just ran \"sudo htop\" then F5 to see the tree of process, I started from the main process responsible for the upgrade to precise and searched for the one reponsible for the download. I killed this one, then the process skips the ms-core-font download part then continues and finishes the updrage to precise.\nIf you don't have the htop, just try ps -ejHf and find the package-data-downloader and kill it.\nroot     29696 11731 29696 29696  0 22:46 pts/2    00:00:04           /usr/bin/dpkg --force-overwrite --status-fd 56 --configure dmsetup libdevmapper1.02.1 libfreetype6 g\nroot     22330 29696 29696 29696  0 23:02 pts/2    00:00:00             /bin/sh /var/lib/dpkg/info/update-notifier-common.postinst configure 0.117ubuntu3.2\nroot     22332 22330 29696 29696  0 23:02 pts/2    00:00:00               /usr/bin/python /usr/lib/update-notifier/package-data-downloader\n\n\nA: You could remove the package and then reinstall it when you have the rest of the system upgraded, I suppose. It is not supposed to fail while downloading the fonts, of course, but if source forge is down for you right now, it might be a workaround option.\n\nA: Additional info:\nI have had exactly the same problem when fresh-installing Kubuntu 12.04 and using a list of installed packages from another machine, which contains Kubuntu 12.04 upgraded from Kubuntu 11.10. \nI gave in \"ttf-mscorefonts-installer\" in the system monitor. Then, I found a process related to the failed installation of ttf-mscorefonts-installer. It failed, because I could not indicate accepting the software license terms. So, I killed the process related to it. Than, I went to the MUON package manager. There, I again gave a command to upgrade ttf-mscorefonts-installer: now it works. I could via the MUON gui indicate to accept the terms. Then, everything ran smoothly. Problem solved. \n\nA: ttf-mscorefonts is not available for 12.04 as of now\nSo the upgrade process is stuck since you have it already installed in your current version.\nRemove the package and try upgrading\nYou could also refer to https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/precise/+package/ttf-mscorefonts-installer\n", "Q: Can i update from \"ubuntu-12.04-desktop-i386.iso\" file? update speed is so slow, and i have download the new iso file:ubuntu-12.04-desktop-i386.iso, can i update directly from the iso file ?\nmy version is 11.10, Any help is appreciated.\n\nA: Upgrading by using the CD or USB image\nIf you are using 10.04 LTS or 11.10 and you either insert the live CD or boot from the live CD to start installing it will give a option of upgrading to 12.04. It will automatically detect installed applications and install the updated version of your applications also.\nIf you download an ISO, the recommendation is to perform a md5sum check to ensure both the ISO downloaded and the burned CD are valid.\n\n*\n\n*Upgrade from 10.04 LTS (here shown with dual boot):\n\nNOTE: Upgrades from 10.04 to 12.04 are not activated yet, see this question for more detail:\n\n*\n\n*Why is \"No new release found\" when upgrading from a LTS to the next?\n\n\n*Upgrade from 11.10\n\nTaken from 12.04LTS upgrade\n\nA: I tried that and did work for me.

If the upgrade dialog is not displayed for any reason, you may also run the following command using Alt+F2:\n\n\ngksu \"sh /media/cdrom/cdromupgrade\"\n\nA: If you burn it to a cd and boot it, and start the installation process you should be able to select the \"upgrade\" option in the menu.\n\nA: Yes, you can! Just boot via Live CD/USB, click Install on welcome Page, after that, click 'Continue' (You can optionally download updates while installing). In the installation type, select \"Upgrade Ubuntu 11.10 to Ubuntu 12.04 LTS\" and click Install Now...

It works fine, this will help you.\n", "Q: Hybrid Graphics Functional won't work with my Asus UL30V anymore The problem is that I am no longer able to boot in compatibility mode for just turning on my Nvidia graphics to install the driver. Because no login screen will appear if Ubuntu is loading. \nIn Ubuntu 11.10 I was able to activate nvidia graphics only' option this way:\n1) Change BIOS to 'compatibility mode' which will turn off the Intel card.\n2) Install the Nvidia proprietary driver using Ubuntu's driver finder (Additional Drivers) and then reboot.\nI was not interested using only the Intel graphics, for the sake of battery life. Now I have both cards running and they drain my battery life dramatically. And the main problem of this configuration no OpenGL is available, so I can't play any games any more.\nAt this point, I have a pre-solution. I uninstalled the nvidia drivers and installed bumblebee. Now the Intel card is recognized. I would prefer to run just the nvidia card as in Ubuntu 11.10 but for now this is better than nothing. Does anybody else have the same problem? \n\nA: Now I think I solved my problem. I did everything like I said above. I reinstalled my nvidia divers like  Lekensteyn said, thanks for the advise. From now on it was very easy. I just have to type optirun  to start a programm with my nvidia G210m card. In glxspheres I get with the intel card 30fps and with the nvida card at least 100fps. I do think this is better than my last solution in ubuntu 11.10 with just running the nvidia card. Now I save battery life and if I want to play or if I need the card for othter programms I can use it with optirun.\nStep by step:\n1) deinstall the current nvidia divers ( sudo apt-get purge nvidia-current )\n2) install bumblebee ( sudo add-apt-repository ppa:bumblebee/stable )\n3) reboot\n4) reinstall the current nvidia drivers ( sudo apt-get install nvidia-current )\n5) reboot\n6) use optirun to start programms with the nvida card ( example: optirun glxsphere )\n", "Q: How to access second disk locally and over LAN I have just added a second 1TB HD to my Ubuntu box and I can see it listed when I run blkid.

Choose the version you want. Ignore b* suffixed versions (beta), and try to opt for latest. Again, its your choice to go for required version.\n[DIR]   10.0.1/         09-Feb-2012 01:11   -    \n[DIR]   10.0.2/         16-Feb-2012 02:55   -    \n[DIR]   10.0.4esr/      22-May-2012 20:56   -    \n[DIR]   10.0/           29-Jan-2012 11:32   -    \n[DIR]   10.0b2/         28-Dec-2011 10:38   -    \n[DIR]   10.0b3/         08-Jan-2012 03:02   -    \n[DIR]   10.0b5/         18-Jan-2012 15:27   -    \n[DIR]   10.0b6/         24-Jan-2012 03:53   -\n\nI am installing 10.0.2 in this example.\n\n*Choose the download based on your OS.\nI am running 32bit Linux so I go for xulrunner-10.0.2.en-US.linux-i686.tar.bz2\n\n*Save the downloaded file, extract/install it.\nsudo tar -xjvf xulrunner-10.0.2.en-US.linux-i686.tar.bz2\n\n\n*Set the path of xulrunner in the application file (eclipse.ini).\n-Dorg.eclipse.swt.browser.XULRunnerPath=/Path_where_xulrunner_is extracted/xulrunner/\n\nNow Eclipse will use the given version of xulrunner installed.\n\nA: xulrunner is no longer available in the repositories for 12.04, but it's very easy to install the latest versions provided by the Mozilla Foundation here. Since these xulrunner releases are self-contained, we'll put them in the /opt directory.\n\n\n*\n\n*Open the terminal with Ctrl+Alt+T\n\n*Type cd /opt\n\n*The below steps will automatically download the appropriate version of xulrunner based on the currently installed version of Firefox and whether your Ubuntu is 32-bit or 64-bit. (If you are running a Firefox beta, etc., please copy the URL manually from your browser and set XURL= to it (see below)\n\n\n*\n\n*Copy and paste in the terminal, line by line:\n\n\n\nFFVER=`grep -Po  \"\\d{2}\\.\\d+\" /usr/lib/firefox/platform.ini`\nARCH=`uname -p`\nXURL=https://ftp.mozilla.org/pub/mozilla.org/xulrunner/releases/$FFVER/runtimes/xulrunner-$FFVER.en-US.linux-$ARCH.tar.bz2\ncd /opt\nsudo sh -c \"wget -O- $XURL | tar -xj\"\nsudo ln -s /opt/xulrunner/xulrunner /usr/bin/xulrunner\nsudo ln -s /opt/xulrunner/xpcshell /usr/bin/xpcshell\n\nxulrunner is now installed, and can be run with simply xulrunner from anywhere. \n\n\n*\n\n*To uninstall it, simply remove the xulrunner directory under /opt, and the /usr/bin/xulrunner and /usr/bin/xpcshell symbolic links.\n\n\nA: You might want to take a look at this thread to see if the solution that worked for conkeror would work for you as well:\nhttp://www.mozdev.org/pipermail/conkeror/2011-October/002666.html\n\nA: Try installing the firefox-dev package. I think that package should provide the libs xulrunner had previously. I'm not sure about runtime libs but it sure does contain the libs required for compiling XUL apps that were previously shipped with XULRunner \n\nA: You can find a description of this problem in the KNIME FAQ.  Basically, just install the binaries from the KNIME Update Site and voila; things should be properly formatted again.\n", "Q: Can I get man pages without installing the corresponding packages? Is there a way to have man pages available for commands i want without having to install the corresponding package?\nFor example, I want to browse the man page for emacs. And I don't have emacs installed and prefer not to install it. I know i can visit man pages online , but I want man emacs to get me the man page. Is there a way for this?\n\nA: The dman command will automatically download a manual page to a temporary cache, and then show it. It's good for displaying manual pages for software that is not installed, though sometimes it doesn't work well, and you do have to wait for the manual page to download. (Manual pages are small though, so that doesn't usually take long.)\nTo get dman, install the bikeshed  package.\ndman's own man page notes:\n\nNote that the network operations will be a little slower  than \n  perhaps\n         you  are  used  to, when reading a manpage.  Also note that you must be\n         internet-connected, and able to  access  manpages.ubuntu.com  for  this\n         utility  to  be  useful.   Finally,  the  algorithm  that  dman uses to\n         retrieve remote pages is considerably simpler than that of man(1).\n\ndman may appear to do nothing at all, if it's unable to find the manual page you're looking for (even sometimes when it should find it). And there's a small delay before and after manual pages are shown. But overall, it's a handy utility to have around, especially when you want to learn more about a program without installing it or switching to a web browser.\n\nA: It depends on the package.  Emacs isn't packaged in a way that you can.  For some packages you can apt-get install basepackage-doc.\n", "Q: Install ruby 1.9.2-p180 via RVM on Ubuntu 12.04 I just upgraded to the newest Ubuntu release and this broke my ruby on rails setup.\nI would like to install ruby 1.9.2-p180 now via RVM:\nrvm install ruby-1.9.2-p180\n\nThis is cancelled due to some errors with openssl:\nossl_ssl.c:110:1: Fehler: »SSLv2_method« ist hier nicht deklariert (nicht in einer Funktion)\nossl_ssl.c:111:1: Fehler: »SSLv2_server_method« ist hier nicht deklariert (nicht in einer Funktion)\nossl_ssl.c:112:1: Fehler: »SSLv2_client_method« ist hier nicht deklariert (nicht in einer Funktion)\nmake[1]: *** [ossl_ssl.o] Fehler 1\n\nSorry as it is in german partially.

What can I do to get a successful installation?\n\nA: You are trying to install old ruby patchlevel.\nThis is fixed in newer patchlevel:\nrvm install 1.9.2\n\nAlso pleas note that 1.9.3 is the current ruby version.\n\nA: Looks like someone actually solved this for us: steps to install ruby 1.9.2-p180 when receiving OpenSSL errors.\nIn case you don't care to visit the link, here are the steps:\n$ bash -s stable < <(curl -s https://raw.github.com/wayneeseguin/rvm/master/binscripts/rvm-installer )\n$ source /etc/profile\n$ rvm pkg install openssl\n$ rvm install 1.9.2-p180 --with-openssl-dir=$rvm_path/usr\nWorked for me, hope it works for you.\n", "Q: Reinstall of Ubuntu 11.10 failed and partitions nor hard disk not being recognized I had Ubuntu 11.10 installed on my Samsung R519. It was working fine and I also had cinammon desktop and KDE installed, but eventually settled with KDE. I had my hard drive partitioned in 3 parts i think, one for boot and the others for file storage. So I would think that ubuntu would simply resintall on the boot partition since it was they who suggested I divide up my hard drive this way.\nAfter a few months however upon bootup Ubuntu started warning me that there were disk errors. When I clicked check and fix, it would apparently never solve the problem. I never bothered to research the disk errors, but just kept ignoring them...until ubuntu eventually crashed on April 26. So i setup a USB install disk and proceeded to reinstall ubuntu and save my paritions and data. However at ''restoring previous installations'' ubuntu hung for several hours then reported that the installer crashed.\nNow when I try to reinstall it is not detecting my partitions or the disk period for that matter. Even at BIOS setup my computer doesn't seem to detect my internal hard drive. It does detect my external harddrive though. So I know the problem is my internal HD. What can I do to get ubuntu or my pc to detect my drive again? Most of my personal data is backed up so if needs be I don't mind wiping the drive.\n\n\n\n\n\nUpdate - When I try to reboot from the disk, it says cannot read master boot record or sector 0.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA: It turns out that my faulty hard drive was the main source of my problems. The BIOS was not even picking it up, so I unplugged it, turned on the computer, then shut down, reconnected it, at which point the computer picked it up. I then was able to reinstall Ubuntu 11.0 after a bit of of GRUB trouble.\n", "Q: Whats the difference between the 12.04 CD and DVD versions? I found myself in confusion when I saw a CD version and a DVD version of the Ubuntu 12.04. I once thought that DVD will include both 32-bit and 64-bit versions, but, actually DVD version also asked me to choose between the two architectures... Any help appreciated.\n\nA: No, the DVD is not multi-architecture.  It simply includes more packages.  It's mainly intended to be the desktop edition CD plus all the stuff we would add to that if only the laws of physics (the CD size limit) didn't get in our way: for instance, it includes Thunderbird, the IcedTea Java web browser plugin, the GIMP image editor, Inkscape, the PiTiVi audio/video editor, and various others.\nSee also:\n\n\n*\n\n*What is on the DVD Edition of Ubuntu?\n\nA: CD includes typical Ubuntu installation, DVD provides extra codecs, extra software etc. out-of-the-box.\nYou can use CD image and after installation set all the nesecary codecs and extras by hand, or use DVD and it will preinstall everything there is.\nI recommend CD image !\n\nA: Ubuntu DVD includes all the language packs and some other useful applications, such as Inkscape, GIMP, Pitivi, plus a more complete LibreOffice suite.\nThe main purpose of DVD version is to provide all languages support. If you don't need that then CD version is recommended as you can download the apps from Ubuntu Software Center.\nAll this information is present at \nhttp://www.ubuntu.com/download/desktop/alternative-downloads\n\nA: I ran a 'diff -y' on the manifests for the CD and the DVD images ( ubuntu-12.04-desktop-i386.manifest and ubuntu-12.04-dvd-i386.manifest ) and it essentially confirms the last two answers of 'Colin Watson' and 'Zeal Kaiser'.\nOf course there are a few more apps included than listed in the two previous answers ( for example 'vim' and 'emacs' as well as 'jre' on so on. The rest are various language packs, locales ( for firfox for example ) and offline help systems ( in four languages for gimp ) and so on. \nI though about dumping the output here BUT I don't think it is appropriate. \nSimply download the manifests for the the CD and the DVD versions, do a diff -y ( or use 'meld' or 'xxdiff' ) )and you'll get the hard facts.\nFor example you can download the DVD manifest at\nhttp://ftp.tu-chemnitz.de/pub/linux/ubuntu-cdimage/releases/precise/release/\nthe CD manifest you could get at \nhttp://nl.releases.ubuntu.com/precise/\nHope this helps!\n", "Q: How can I disable Apper?

I understand that Ubuntu 12.04 will be supported for 5 years.  Is this true for all other variations of ubuntu too?  For example, will lubuntu 12.04, xubuntu 12.04 and the rest also be supported for 5 years?\nAnd if not, does that mean it's better to install ubuntu 12.04 and then maybe\nsudo aptitude install lxde\n\nor\nsudo aptitude install xfce\n\n\nA: It will not make any difference how you install the various flavors and desktop environments. Each flavor has made a decision on the length of support for 12.04. In the case of Xubuntu, it is officially an LTS and will be supported for three years. Ubuntu is an LTS and will be supported for five years. That means Lubuntu is not an official LTS and yet will also be supported for three years. Please read the release notes for more information about the support time for each flavor.\nhttps://wiki.ubuntu.com/PrecisePangolin/ReleaseNotes\n\nA: I don't know about lxde, but xfce is supported only for 3 years.\nAnd it doesn't matter wheather you will install extra GUI's on your existing desktop.\nI think, each desktop will be supported for certen number of years.\n\nA: Lubuntu 12.04 will be supported for 18 months only !\nSource: The link Charlie provided.\n", "Q: Having problem to login after upgrading from 11.10 to 12.04 I just update to 12.04 from 11.10 and I get to the login screen w/o problems. When I enter my password the screen turns black and returns to the login screen half a second later. \nThere is a related question out there which was solved by creating more space on the disk but my disks (or rather partitions) are all below 30%.\nI can log in as guest. I can also login at the cmd prompt (going to tty with Alt+Ctrl+F1) with my normal user credentials. When logged in as guest I can also install programs using my normal account password.\nThere is the normal authentication error when I mistype my password so I'm also sure the password works.\nAny suggestions?\n\nA: Ok I actually figured this one out myself.\nThe problem was that I had installed 12.04 from CD but retained the old home partition.

I am still unclear what you are asking.  If you are planning to upgrade to 12.04 a list of the software that is in installed as part of the distrubution is listed here and on many other sites including www.ubuntu.com .  \nBut like all Ubuntu distributions you have the Software centre where to can browse and download what packages you need\n", "Q: Adding a new swap file. How to edit fstab to enable swap after reboot? I've deleted my existing swap partition due to some partitioning problem. I don't have a swap space now so I've created a swap file with:\ndd if=/dev/zero of=/root/myswapfile bs=1M count=1024\n\nHere's after swapon -s:\n/root/myswapfile    file    1048572    1320    -1\n\nNow I want to edit my /etc/fstab to enable the swap file after reboot.\n\nA: These ares the steps to create a swap on a file:\nCreate a large file e.g. with\nsudo mkdir -p /var/cache/swap/   # create a directory that holds the swap file\nsudo dd if=/dev/zero of=/var/cache/swap/myswap bs=1M count=4096 # for 4 GByte\n\nOf course any other method of creating a file of defined size would do. \nAnnounce swap to the system\nsudo chmod 0600 /var/cache/swap/myswap # only root should have access\nsudo mkswap /var/cache/swap/myswap # format as swap\nsudo swapon /var/cache/swap/myswap # announce to system\n\nInsert the following line in /etc/fstab for swap from the next boot:\n/var/cache/swap/myswap    none    swap    sw    0   0\n\nNote: In case you have your system files on a SSD you may want to consider to hold your swap file on a hard disk location.\nAlso note: You can not use a swap file for hibernation (see Ubuntu SwapFaq)\nAdditional note for Ubuntu >= 17.04: A swap on file /swapfile is created by default in a new installation (when no swap partition was present). We can manually create a swap partition later if we prefer.\nIn case we want to replace an existing swap (e.g. partition) with another swap (e.g. on file) we need to remove the old swap with\nsudo swapoff -a  # for all\n\nThen remove the swap entry from /etc/fstab or replace it with the new swap respectively.\n", "Q: Great amount of diskspace is used and I hardly have any files I've recently installed Lubuntu and copied a great amount of things to it and deleted them.

Note the circled line which says that /dev/sda1 is mounted on /. This is the \"root\" of your filesystem.\nIf you are using the Ubuntu you installed to your hard drive then your root partition should be on your hard drive. Check this by looking at the size value. The partition on your hard drive should be the largest one shown.

However, I think you'll find the machine has booted and is operational, albeit in text-only mode - try switching to the first console by holding down the CONTROL, ALT and F1 keys. Hopefully, you'll find a login screen to allow you to access the system.\nAlso, try booting by removing \"splash\" and \"quiet\" from the kernel command line by editing the grub menu entry.

This machine was older for mainly file service, so I just replaced the video card and all was well.  However, it appeared that it hangs at a grub selection screen.  Pressing enter to start the loading seemed to kick things off.  I don't know if it would have booted at some point without enter or not.\nSo, you might just press enter as it might be on a screen that can't be seen correctly.  Or, try another video card.

What do you think, does it worth it to upgrade to 12.04?\nPreinstalled 10.04 works very well. I am thinking about performance issues, I would have the 12.04 as on my bigger machines but don't know how it will run on a Netbook\nAny ideas, experiences?\n\nA: How about trying the new version by booting from USB a couple of times without doing a full blown complete install?  This way you can play around and see if there are any driver (or other) issues.\n\nA: According to this article in Phoronix (see page 6), the boot time for a Dell Mini 9 increases from 20 seconds on 10.04 to 50 seconds on 12.04. The Dell Mini used to be the reference system for tuning the boot process back in 2010, but it's not any more, so this may not mean that the system is slower overall, only that its boot process has been optimized for newer machines.\nIf your Dell Mini has a 4GiB SDD, I believe Ubuntu 12.04 will simply refuse to install.\nOther than that, an upgrade is beneficial in that you end up with software at its latest version. Also bear in mind that support for 10.04 ends in a year's time, so if your Dell Mini is likely to live past that point you should eventually update to 12.04.\n\nA: I agree with everything the previous poster said, but would like to add a couple of points. Very probably 12.04 will have better battery life, there has been a lot of attention to that aspect on this release and 10.04 was criticized for less than stellar battery life. And the Unity and Gnome3 desktops available on 12.04 are quite reasonable choices for a little netbook, much as I hate them on a regular desktop.  \nThat said, I'm keeping 10.04 on my Dell Mini (I have kubuntu) and 10.04 on my AcerOne that I'm typing on now until support is dropped in a year. These machines generally live near a plug and I LOVE the 10 sec boot up times. I've never had anything like it on any OS and any hardware, even my 6 core desktop. In a year when Lucid stops being supported I'll do fresh installs, either of 12.04 or 13.04 or perhaps the newly minted Debian 7 if that is shaped up nicely. At that point 12.04 will have 4 years of support left and Debian stable will have about 3 years, that should nurse these netbooks to the end of their active life.\n\nA: Definitely, you should upgrade your Dell mini from 10.04 LTS to 12.04 LTS, it works okay!\nMy experience in upgrade process from 10.04 to 12.04 was not smooth, I was using alternate 12.04 iso image to upgrade (offline upgrade), but because my Dell mini was also installed with packages from various PPAs (particularly GIS stuff), the upgrade process was refused to continue with specific error message saying that the upgrade can not calculate the size of packages to upgrade, something like that. \nSo, I take a short cut, make a clean install (yes! using the same alternate iso which burned to bootable usb). And it works!\nI am happy 12.04 user now, and everything works, like wireless, sound, bluetooth, video cam  etc, even Rythmbox works better compared to when run in 10.04. \nAnd for sure power management in 12.04 is flawless, like: when you're running out of battery power, the system will to refuse to activate when you push power button, until you connected to AC power, but you're not losing your previous work, because the system is not actually shutdown! it just like a normal system suspend in action. \nAnd I should say, I love Unity...\nOn performance side, I can log in using Ubuntu 3D but the Intel Atom processor seems to work better when I log in using Ubuntu 2D, which I don't mind at all.\nhope this help!\n", "Q: Upgrade option unavailable when upgrading from 11.10 to 12.04 from a USB stick I created a USB startup disk from ISO and booted using that to upgrade my 11.10 installation. But when I am not able to select Upgrade from Ubuntu 11.10 to Ubuntu 12.04. The radio button cannot be selected. I am doing a Network upgrade now.\n\nA: If are trying that upgrade with a \"live USB\" then you can't. Though if you have the alternate iso, then you could avoid wasting a CD by mounting the ISO as a drive with a command like:\nsudo mkdir -p /media/cdrom\nsudo mount -o loop ~/Desktop/ubuntu-11.10-alternate-i386.iso /media/cdrom\n\nThen to start the upgrade enter:\ngksu \"sh /media/cdrom/cdromupgrade\"\n\n", "Q: Mount folder using ssh twice (first ssh to gate, then from gate to workstation) My current situation is that I have my personal laptop, and I there is a workstation I need to be able to mount.

So I can work on my documents on the workstation?\nAny ideas on how to do this?\n\nA: This should be possible with SSH-forwarding. E.g.\n$ ssh -f -L 2200:username@workstation:22 username@gate -N\n$ sshfs -p 2200 localhost:/path/to/remote/dir /path/to/mount/point\n\nHowever, the administrator of your gateway computer might have disabled SSH forwarding, in which case I think you're out of luck with this option.\nAnother possibility is to use SSH-bouncing.

My conclusion is that while compiz once had support for this, it has not been functional in a while. Since Unity uses compiz, it cannot do it either at the moment.\nThere seem to be very few window managers that support this feature at all. The only one I was able to find was xmonad, which is a keyboard-driven tiling window manager intended for power users willing to spend quite a bit of time learning how to use it. I think I've seen references to awesome being able to do this too, which is another similar tiling window manager.\nSo unfortunately the answer for compiz and unity seems to be \"no, not possible\", and the answer more generally seems to be \"no, not unless you are willing to switch to a tiling window manager\".\n\nA: I know this is old, but for people looking into this, Enlightenment 0.19.x (http://enlightenment.org) has good support for multiple screens, and is able to switch workspaces independently or simultaneously on two screens (haven't tried with three or more). I switched from xfce4 and haven't looked back. You can find a PPA at https://launchpad.net/~niko2040/+archive/ubuntu/e19\nEDIT: The reason this isn't common functionality is that it violates a freedesktop.org specification (EWMH - http://standards.freedesktop.org/wm-spec/wm-spec-latest.html) that most window managers follow. Those window managers that support this simply do not follow the specification.\n\nA: Actually, you don't need to use a tiling window manager. As far as I know, xmonad and awesome support this feature, and i3 does to a certain extent.\nBut they are all tiling. Wingo is a hybrid window manager that has per-monitor workspaces, and it can be used as either a regular window manager or a tiling manager (or both).

Please upgrade your kernel before installing glibc.\n\nThe installation of a 2.6 kernel _could_ ask you to install a new\nlibc first, this is NOT a bug, and should *NOT* be reported. \nIn that case, please add lenny sources to your /etc/apt/sources.list\nand run:   apt-get install -t lenny linux-image-2.6 Then reboot into \nthis new kernel, and proceed with your upgrade \n\ndpkg: error processing /var/cache/apt/archives/libc6_2.15-0ubuntu10_amd64.deb (--unpack):  subprocess new pre-installation script returned error exit status 1 No apport report written because MaxReports is reached already\n\nCould not install the upgrades \n\nThe upgrade has aborted.

Can you post the output of uname -r?\nYou are getting the error because your provider is running an old OpenVZ Linux kernel (usually 2.6.18); as the message says, the default libc included with Precise requires 2.6.24 or above.\nPlease see my answer here for full details, but the gist is that I've set up a PPA with recompiled libc to work on older (at least 2.6.18) kernels, and that should solve your problem. Please try adding ppa:izx/ovz-libc, updating, and then retrying the upgrade. Specifically:\napt-add-repository ppa:izx/ovz-libc\napt-get update\napt-get -f install\ndo-release-upgrade\n\nshould probably do it. Recommend answering NO to all \"update config?\" questions.\nLet me know how it goes -- I know the recompiled libc works perfectly for folks starting off with 12.04 or who have upgraded to it with the help of their host.\n\nA: Did you ensure that the machine is fully updated before starting the upgrade process? Run the following first:\nsudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get dist-upgrade\nto be quite sure that everything is updated for 11.10 first. After that has completed successfully, run:\nsudo do-release-upgrade\n\nA: I did have an issue kind of similar with the kernel, try updating this way instead it worked fine for me. ubuntu 12.04 update info\n", "Q: I can't install grub2 I can't install grub2 on my system.\ni followed the guide, but when i chroot on my ubuntu partition and type: \ngrub-install /dev/sdb\n\nI get this error:\n\nroot@ubuntu:/# grub-install /dev/sdb\n  /usr/sbin/grub-setup: error: hd0 appears to contain a iso9660 filesystem which isn't known to reserve space for DOS-style boot.

Even themes advertised as Gnome-shell 3.4 compatible have graphical issues on Gnome-Shell 3.4.

Previously, I have installed Windows 7 on my 320 GB laptop with three partitions 173, 84 and 63 GB each. The 63 GB partition was where the Windows was installed. The rest were for file containers.\nNow I changed my OS to Ubuntu 12.04 LTS. I installed Ubuntu by replacing the entire Windows 7 on the 63 GB partition. The rest of the partitions remain as an NTFS Windows partition and I can still access them both (the 173 and 84 GB partitions).\nNow I want to change the two partitions of Windows into an Ubuntu format partitions plus most importantly, I want to extend the 63 GB partition to more than a 100 GB because at the moment I am running out of disk space. Whenever I try to install any application, especially using wine, it always complains for a shortage of disk space.\nHow do I do the extending activity before I entirely format my laptop again and lose all the important files on my partitions?\n\nA: If you have already installed Ubuntu 12.04, then install GParted with sudo apt-get install gparted.\nLaunch it using Alt+F2, and typing gparted.\nIn order to expand the 63GB partition, you must have unallocated space adjacent right to this partition. So first you will have to use GParted to resize a partition above or below your 63GB partition. Refer the following figure:\n\nWhen you click on resize, a window will open where you can easily drag and resize your partition. Once the free space is made available, resize your 63GB partition just like the above covering that free space.\n\nA: You can only re-partition unmounted partitions.\nI have a GParted live disc ready for things like that. You can find it here: https://gparted.org/livecd.php\nBasic features:\n\n*\n\n*Create partition tables, (e.g., msdos or gpt)\n\n*Create, move, copy, resize, check, label, set new UUID, and delete partitions\n\n*Enable and disable partition flags, (e.g., boot or hidden)\n\n*Align partitions to mebibyte (MiB) or traditional cylinder boundaries\n\n*Attempt data rescue from lost partitions\n\nResizing is explained in the documentation of GParted. In short (the link has some extra information and tips):\nResizing and moving a partition can be performed by a single GParted operation. To resize a partition:\n\n*\n\n*Select an unmounted partition. See the section called “Selecting a Partition”.\n\n\n*Choose: Partition → Resize/Move. The application displays the Resize/Move /path-to-partition dialog.\n\n\n*Adjust the size of the partition. See the section called “Specifying Partition Size and Location”.\n\n\n*Specify the alignment of the partition. See the section called “Specifying Partition Alignment”.\n\n\n*Click Resize/Move.\n\nA: (Step 0:) Back up anything really valuable. This is a pretty tried and tested formula but things can go wrong. A power cut at the wrong moment could really ruin your day if you haven't backed up.\n\n*\n\n*Boot to a live CD or live USB drive in \"try me\" mode.\n\n*Load GParted (should be installed by default, you can apt-get it if it's not)\n\n*Resize your partitions (right click, click resize, follow the instructions).\n\n*Click apply and sit back while it does the job.\n\n*Reboot, taking out the USB stick or CD when it tells you to.\n\n\nA: One way that you can shrink partitions without losing data is by using GParted.  A very good application, but be careful with it.\nEdit: Boot from a live CD so you will be able to do the resizing. Install gparted with Ubuntu Software center, or any other way (synaptic etc) you prefer, if it isn't already installed.  \nIt will ask you to authenticate when you run it, as it has access to things that can damage your installation badly. Realise that by altering partitions on your hard drive(s) you can potentially stop your system booting completely.  As I said, be careful.\nIt will then search devices it can see and display the partitions on the first one (probably /dev/sda, if not try different devices from the pull down at the top right).  You should be able to see that one of them contains your root (/) mount point. When you are sure you have the correct one (the size itself is a good indicator), right-click on that partition and choose Resize/Move (if it is greyed out, you might need to unmount it first (make sure you have booted off a live CD, and not your installed linux system).   Reduce the size in the middle (New Size) edit box to what you want (make sure it's still large enough for your system's needs).  Click on resize/move, then use the big green tick to apply the changes. If it reports success, then should be able to shutdown the live cd and reboot into your main system.\nEdit2:  I just googled a tutorial you might look at  gpart tutorial\n", "Q: Network problem in 12.04 I am trying to install Ubuntu 12.04 but when I run installer (or LiveCD) it writes that there is no connection to Internet (I don`t continue installation because ubuntu is the only OS on my pc and I need Internet access).

Either wait a few days until the hype calms down or try waiting till later on at night (when I upgraded mine) when the servers are less busy.\nAnother suggestion would be to try and find the best server for you area by having a look at this question. I found the second answer best as you can let the computer automatically choose the best server for your connection.\nAlternatively you could download the .iso from the Ubuntu website, create a live CD or USB and upgrade that way.\nHope this answers your question.\n", "Q: How long before Ubuntu One downloads music purchases How long does it take on average for a song purchased through the Ubuntu One Music store to be downloaded to my computer?\n\nA: Normally, it should happen fairly quickly. If it takes more than a few minutes then it is likely the song didn't get queued for download to the Ubuntu One server, and a support request should be filed. It may also take slightly longer during an Ubuntu release, as some servers get bandwidth throttled to make additional bandwidth available for the large number of downloads of Ubuntu that will happen during the release.\n", "Q: USB Stick Creation CD Creator will not locate my USB Stick to create 12.4 LTS OS.

In the screenshot here of my GParted, you can see Fedora 16 installed on /dev/sda4 and Ubuntu (with the mount point \"/\") on /dev/sda6.  Partition /dev/sda5 is taking up 48 GiB of space and there seems to be nothing on it but a lost+found folder.  I want to remove this partition and expand both my Fedora and Ubuntu partitions to use the resulting unallocated space.  This is a fresh install of both operatng systems and there is no data on the computer to lose.  Is it safe to remove the /dev/sda5 partition and resize the other two using GParted from a live CD?\n\n\nA: Since no one had an answer, I went ahead and tried it out.  I was warned that moving and Resizing my boot partition my result in problems, but forged ahead anyway.  I deleted the /dev/sda5 partition and resized both my Fedora and Ubuntu partitions, all using GParted on my Ubuntu 12.04 LiveCD, and everything went fine.

This command can encrypt and decrypt a file for you.  (you might need to install it by 'sudo apt-get install mcrypt').\n2) change read permission for the directory.  \n\nA: You can create/mount an encrypted directory with encfs like this:\nmkdir -p ./content\nencfs -i 5 $PWD/raw $PWD/content\n\nThe first time you do this it will ask some questions, you can accept the defaults, and it will ask for a password which you will have to enter later every time to unlock.\nThe encrypted content will be created under $PWD/raw, which will be mounted on $PWD/content. You can create files in $PWD/content or just copy there, and you will see that $PWD/raw gets populated with unreadable data. $PWD/content is visible only by your user, not even root can see it. When you are done editing, unmount with fusermount -u ./content, this will wipe out the content of $PWD/content. To mount again, repeat the encfs command above.\nThe path parameters for encfs must be absolute paths, that's why I used $PWD above, to use directories in the current working directory.\nThe -i 5 means unmount automatically after idle for 5 minutes. \n", "Q: Compiz in Precise 12.04 - Unity 2D \nPossible Duplicate:\nHow can I make Unity 2D launcher icons smaller? \n\nI'm looking to be able to tweak some things in Unity 2D.

In the first place, deja-dup is designed to periodically backup to a storage location, and I'm not sure if DVDs are an option here.\nIf you wanted a DVD backup of OS just because you had one in Windows (some prefer to call them Recovery disks), That wont be necessary. You can freshly install the OS right from the scratch, as many times as u want.\nIf you are looking for a way to backup your OS with all its programs, I advise not to do so. A good number of packages are updated frequently, and the backup will be out-of date in this respect in no time. A better way is to do a fresh-install of the programs following a clean install.

Let's start with the symptoms:\n\n\n*\n\n*I initially tried installing through a USB flash with the desktop amd64 version. Since it had worked on all other (5) computers, I believe the USB flash drive was ok. However the computer seemed to be stuck after the Ubuntu GUI came up (bar on the top, pinkish background) but before the screen prompting to Try or Install. When the screen came up, the mouse was moving exceptionally slowly, i.e. it responded 2-3 seconds after I had moved it. After a few minutes, I could move the mouse with normal speed, but could not click anything. The Try/Install window never came up. The same thing had happened a few days ago when I had tried to install Ubuntu 12.04 Beta 2 on the same computer, but when the Try/Install screen kept failing to come up, I gave up. \n\n*I assumed it was a problem with the desktop installer, so I tried the alternative installer, which worked fine. But then, the same (or possibly a similar) problem appears on the login screen: the mouse moves very slowly in the first few minutes, then it moves normally, I cannot click anything (for example the buttons on the top right), and I cannot type in my password to login or select the guest session. \nSo I am stuck at the login screen. I did not encounter any problems on my other computers, so here are some specs of this one:\n\n\n*\n\n*CPU: Intel i7 980x extreme edition\n\n*Motherboard: Asus Rampage III extreme\n\n*RAM: 6GB\n\n*GPUs: 2x NVidia GTX 580 in SLI\n\n*HDD: Western digital 1TB green power (20GB for root (/), 6GB for swap, all the rest for /home)\n\n\nI should also note that this PC ran 11.10 flawlessly until yesterday, when I attempted to install 12.04. I tried installing 11.10 after I failed with 12.04 and it worked again, so its definitely something related to 12.04. \nUnfortunately, due to the nature of the problem, I don't know how to provide any logs, but if there is some way let me know. \n\nA: I had the same problem with Nvidia GITX 580 on 12.04 64bit.

As soon as the \"Install\" Welcome screen appeared I would get a blank white box in the middle (where the Try/Install Ubuntu normally is displayed)\nI fixed it as follows:\nJust as the CD is booting (i.e. when the purple background first appears) press F6. You will get a few options (Try Ubuntu, Install Ubuntu, etc).  You will also have the ability to press F6 again to select booting options.  Select nomodeset and then proceed to \"Install Ubuntu\".

When it show the welcome screen, follow it carefully. Just now I installed it on my machine without any issues.\n\nA: This doesn't work on 12.10 (quantal) because dropbox hasn't put a quantal package in its repository. You can see that by manually looking at the repo (http://linux.dropbox.com/ubuntu/dists/) and see that quantal isn't there. \nI solved this by using precise in my source file instead of quantal. Technically, I'm using a version of dropbox that's not meant for my system, but I'm assuming the differences are small (it's only 6 months). So far, no problems on two different machines. YMMV.\nNote: this is valid as of the time I'm typing this.

I use Eclipse for this. It used to work great. Yesterday, I upgraded to 12.04 and everything works great, but Eclipse doesn't start anymore. It just shows a blank screen, which I can't click away. \n\nI'm not really an extremely technical guy, But I really need this to work. And yes I've removed and re-installed eclipse.\n\nA: Ok, I found out the problem - should anyone recognize the above screenshot, the problem lies with dropbox sync across 11.10 and 12.04.

Upgrade Kubuntu system from 11.10 to 12.04 wiped out grub.  Attempt to boot from external drive results in Grub reporting no partition found three times.  Grub reinstall attempts on my part result in failure with 'cannot stat aufs' message.  Request assistance to restore Grub.\n\nA: Solved - \nFor info - https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Boot-Repair\nRepaired the above case for the three installed systems on one external hard drive; and another case where after a clean install of Ub 12.04 (on a different external drive) the intitial result on reboot after completing the install resulted in grub reporting \"error: no such partition\".\n\nA: I had the SAME problem. 4 times Grub was wiped out. I thought about it, checked the forums and no one had an answer. Then I remembered I had trouble installing 11.04 when I selected \"Download Updates\" during the installation. I read on a forum not to select the updates during the install and do the updates in terminal after the installation completed. So the 5th time I installed the upgrade from Terminal. Sudo \"do-release-upgrade -d\". Worked perfectly with no issues. I was prompted where to install grub and the installation confirmed it had found ALL of the operating systems I had installed and added them to the list. I ran all the applicantions I have installed with no issues what so ever and 12.04 seems faster. Good luck...\n", "Q: Alt+Tab is not switching between windows on Ubuntu 12.04 (Precise Pangolin) Alt+Tab is not switching between windows.

I found that it's duplicate of 971051. Let's make these bugs heater! \nAs temporary solution we can install CompizConfig Settings Manager and select 'Application Switcher' or 'Static Application Switcher' from Window Management group.\n\nA: Well, just to finalize the answer, a reboot has done the trick for me after doing the following:\nI went to system-settings -> keyboard -> shortcuts and almost all of them were disabled. I assigned \"Alt+Tab\" to \"Switch applications\". Then even though the problem specified in one of the comments above persisted, a reboot has solved the problem and I'm able to switch between windows without any problem.\nEdit: Sometimes you have to reboot multiple times.\n", "Q: Cannot install Ubuntu 12.04 I can install any ubuntu version up to 11.10 64Bit, but trying to upgrade the system became unstable after grub , the mouse keeps jumping.

Why such discrimination, I'm having this since alpha 1204\n", "Q: 12.04 UI problems I just distro upgraded to 12.04. I hoped that this time I won't have to suffer a whole night to get everything working, but my hopes were shot down quite quickly.\nThe UI in 12.04 is seriously broken, and I don't know why. The Unity animations are slow or not there at all. The Launcher reacts only like every third time I try to get it to show (I have it on auto-hide). Neither the application switcher (alt-tab) nor the workspace switcher look as they should. I can't take a screenshot of either. The app switcher only looks bad (like a Win98 default skin), it works. The workspace switcher (Expo) doesn't really. It opens without animation, and all the windows are displayed on the workspace in a grid, not just the top one. They can't be moved either. It also seems to ignore my settings that there should be 2*3 (total 6) workspaces, and only displays 5.\nI get the feeling that this is due to some config clash from the upgrade. Is there any way I can fix it? If there's a way to nuke all settings or the whole gui and reinstall it clean and clear, I'm fine with that too.\n\nA: Open terminal and then type\n    unity --reset in terminal. And then check the GUI and then revert us.\n\nA: For those like me who aren't able to solve this problem with the answers already provided, I have an answer that worked. But, first let me mention something that didn't work. I took the extreme step of logging into the full screen terminal, Ctrl-Alt-F1 so that I could safely completely purge Unity and the Ubuntu desktop, and then re-install it and reboot. Nothing improved after that. Another answer that didn't work was to do a clean install of 11.10 and then immediately upgrade to 12.04.\nThe final solution for me that worked perfectly was to do a clean install of 11.10, install all the updates and extra applications I wanted, activate the proprietary NVIDIA accelerated graphics driver, get my desktop working just the way I wanted it to, make the proprietary accelerated graphics driver inactive again, and then upgrade to 12.04.\nBy the way, once you've got the screen looking and working just right with the proprietary accelerated graphics driver, all the settings will continue to work even after making that driver inactive. At least that's how it is on my system. The added advantage is that the flickering goes away. In 11.10, there was no flickering or poor quality fonts when the proprietary driver was active, but those are currently problems in 12.04, so just make it inactive and everything will be great.\nAlso, if you don't like how hard it is to get the Unity launcher to activate while in autohide in 12.04, you can fix that too. Just go to System Settings and click on Appearance. Now the Appearance dialogue includes a Behavior tab at the top which lets you increase or decrease the launcher sensitivity to moving the mouse pointer to the hot spot. Even better, you can move the hot spot back to the top left corner so you can make it highly sensitive without having it get in the way every time you need to click on something on the left side of the screen.\nI hope my answer to question asked here, that worked for me, will help someone else as well.\n", "Q: Virtualbox guest additions in 12.04 and Vbox 4.1.14 (Windows 7 host) It would appear it's impossible to get virtualbox guest additions working in a windows 7 host running vbox 4.1.14 and an ubuntu 12.04 32-bit guest.\nI've tried the standard .iso, the .run file, and the official ubuntu virtualbox-ose-guest packages.. none of them allow me to turn on seamless mode or use copy/paste.\nAny help would be much appreciated!\n\nA: This works for me - with reservations!  I obeyed all the standard instructions from the documentation (update, upgrade, install dkms, reboot, then install Guest Additions and reboot again).\nThe problems start in Full Screen or Seamless mode where it appears the the screen refresh is broken - for example you get up a Terminal and start typing - nothing happens.  Click OUTSIDE the terminal and all your typing magically appears. Reverting to windowed mode fixes this and the system works including cut and paste between Windows and Ubuntu.\n", "Q: 12.04 wired network doesn't work RTL8111/8168B its a fresh 12.04 install 64bits.\nwifi works fine, wired stays off with cable connected and network-manager shows as if cable is disconnected.\nTurning off networking lights up my network-cards leds, turning networking on shuts off the leds and no communication is possible.\nI already tried, turning off the network-manager (sudo service network-manager stop) and setting up my eth0 manually, as soon as I switch off the network-manager my leds light up, but after setting up manually eth0 (sudo ifconfig eth0 10.2.10.114 netmask 255.255.0.0 up) the leds turn off again.

By following this blog post my wired connection is now consistent and best of all fast. Should you install a new kernel version you should do the install of the module after booting into the new kernel. The package with driver is available on the Realtek website and has an auto install shell script however i have found it far easier and reliable to simply copy/paste the commands into a terminal.

When I switch the OS to use wicd the wired connection problem with rtl8111/r8168 disappears. \nA check of lsmod shows that the r8169 module is loaded. As a result of this experiment I believe that the problem lies within network-manager and not the module. I could be wrong and often am, but the experiment is easy enough to try. \n\nA: Try this command and see if it works\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get install bcmwl-kernel-source\n\n", "Q: Stuck at 'VMware easy install' I have a Mac OS X and VMware Fusion.

But the problem is when I try to install the Nvidia driver, I chose recommended version and when installation finishes, I reboot my system but all I see is a black screen and system doesn't starts and stays on a black screen also the mouse can't move. I've tried 3 times but problem continues.\nHow can I solve this problem?\n\nA: Your problem is very similar to ones I have been experiencing.\nAfter installing NVIDIA driver (either 'current' or 'current updates'- makes no difference)  rebooting will fail to load graphics. NOTE: I also had the same problem during (clean) install, so if you did not, below may not be appropriate for you.\nTo circumvent this, at the grub menu highlight your normal choice, but press 'SHIFT' + 'e' (on occasion I have had to press 'e' twice). This should allow you to edit the configuration that Ubuntu will load. Use the arrow keys to move down to the line containing the words \"quiet splash\". Delete \"quiet splash\" and replace with \"nomodeset\" and press 'CTRL' and 'X' to save your change and return you to the Grub menu. You then press 'Enter' normally and you should see Ubuntu loading. Good Luck! If this does allow you to boot Ubuntu, then you will either need to repeat the procedure each time you boot or (preferably) make the Grub change permanent. There is already an answer somewhere for this (try How do I set 'nomodeset' after I've already installed Ubuntu?).\n\nA: Its very hard to get with your real problem but it seems you installed the recommended driver and stuck somewhere after reboot, is it? Do this if u can: Run the Recovery mode when system boots up and run the broken packages and restart again.Update your system and still the problem sustains,then come here and update your question with details of what you did.\n", "Q: How to set a shortcut for \"Always on Top\" for window? In 12.04 (Unity), I would like to assign a shortcut to the \"always on top option\" for a window. Probably something like Ctrl+Shift+Home to turn on and Ctrl+Shift+End to turn off, or whatever. Is there an option to do this somewhere in the Compiz Settings Manager?\nThis (old) post claimed that \n\nFor compiz, Enable Extra WM Actions.

You can set the desired action there easily.\n\nA: I tried to use the wmctrl command toggle, but it didn't work on my Ubuntu set up. The toggle would toggle on, but not toggle off. (I think it might be because I'm using the gnome desktop environment, on which wmctrl is slightly broken AFAIK).\nAnyway, after a lot of research and working out how to write proper code in bash, I created a single command that uses the wmctrl commands within a layer of logic to toggle the 'always on top' state effectively on the current GNOME desktop. I posted this answer on Ask Unix/Linux, but thought I'd post it here too in case anyone had the same issue.\nHere is the command:\nbash -c 'wmctrl -r :ACTIVE: -b $([[ $(xprop -id $(xprop -root -f _NET_ACTIVE_WINDOW 0x \" \\$0\\\\n\" _NET_ACTIVE_WINDOW | awk \"{print \\$2}\") _NET_WM_STATE) =~ \"ABOVE\" ]] && echo \"remove\" || echo \"add\"),above'\n\nIt checks the active window state property \"_NET_WM_STATE\" using xprops, and if it contains the text \"ABOVE\" that means the 'always on top' option is active. Then it just runs the wmctrl command with the parameter add or remove as appropriate.\n\nCommand breakdown (each command is inserted into the next, replacing the ■ placeholder):\n\n*\n\n*Get active window id:\n xprop -root -f _NET_ACTIVE_WINDOW 0x \" \\$0\\\\n\" _NET_ACTIVE_WINDOW | awk \"{print \\$2}\"\n\n\n\n*Get the window state from xprop using the id:\n xprop -id $(■) _NET_WM_STATE\n\n\n\n*Check if the state contains \"ABOVE\", indicating that the window is set to \"always on top\":\n [[ $(■) =~ \"ABOVE\" ]]\n\n\n\n*Return \"remove\" if true, otherwise return \"add\":\n ■ && echo \"remove\" || echo \"add\"\n\n\n\n*run wmctrl command using the returned value as a parameter:\n wmctrl -r :ACTIVE: -b $(■),above\n\n\n\n*Send the whole thing to bash so that you can use command substitution ${ ... }, bash boolean evaluation [[ ... ]] and the regex match operator =~:\n bash -c '■'\n\nThis last step in particular took me a very long time to figure out. Until I realised that the keyboard shortcuts weren't running in bash by default, I had no idea why the commands were working in the console as I was testing them but silently failing when run directly as a keyboard shortcut. It drove me up the wall for ages!\nNote: because you need quotes around the command you're sending to bash, I had to be careful when writing the command that I never went more than one more level deep (using double quotes). Any further nesting of strings in quotes would have required lots of confusing backslashes to escape the quotes.\nFurther detailed notes: how to create the keyboard shortcut (thanks @rajesh_chaurasiya)\n\n*\n\n*Install wmctrl using sudo apt-get install wmctrl if you haven't already\n\n\n*Go to system settings > keyboard shortcuts. Click the + button to add a custom shortcut.\n\n\n*Choose a name such as 'Toggle always on top' ( it can be anything you like ).\n\n\n*In the command field add the full command from the top of this answer.\n\n\n*Record a keybinding to complete the shortcut.\n\nA: It should work on every Ubuntu OS since version 9.04 without installing anything, modifying of creating any shortcuts.\nTry Alt + Space,  T\n\n\n*\n\n*Alt + Space  as the first shortcut brings up the right-click mouse menu\n\n*T selects the \"Always On Top\" function.\n\nA: Another, better I think, solution is to add Alt+A as a shortcut to toggle the \"Always on Top\" property of a window. This can be done via gconf-editor. Just follow the simple instructions given in this video.\nEDIT :  Copied from the video\n\n\n*\n\n*if you are using 12.04 && 12.10 you have to install gconf-editor\nsudo apt-get install gconf-editor\n\n*Type gconf-editor in terminal.\n\n*Click on apps\n\n*Go to metacity\n\n*window_keybindings\n\n*right click inside the right box and click on new key\n\n*Choose string from the dropdown list.\n\n*Add the word toggle_above\n\n*Write any command you want. i.e : A and press OK\nDone :-)\n\nA: Since no one has mentioned this yet, I'll just leave a solution that worked for me on Ubuntu 12.04. \nYou could setup a regular keyboard shortcut and use wmctrl to toggle the \"Always on Top\" option. \nGo to   System Settings > Keyboard > Shortcuts > Custom Shortcuts. Hit the + and give your shortcut a name. Then enter the following command.\nwmctrl -r :ACTIVE: -b toggle,above\n\nIf you don't have it already, you can install wmctrl from the repos using\nsudo apt-get install wmctrl\n\nYou should have something that looks similar to this.\n\nHit apply and you should be good to go! \nThis solution came from a discussion on Ubuntu forums.\n\nA: It may be too late but if anyone search for it again and come here, there is, as for me, a more simple solution:\nOn Ubuntu and on many other distributions using GTK (they mostly share the setting panel), you can go to Setting -> keyboard > shortcut. In the \"list\" of shortcut, you will find the entry unassigned to keep a windows on top. Not sure of the name in English but in French it's \"Activer/Désactiver la mise au premier plan de la fenêtre\".\nIn English, it is \"Rise window above other windows\".\n\nSet it and that's it :)\n\nA: This one is quite (very) old, but still, here is what did it for me:\ndconf write /org/gnome/desktop/wm/keybindings/always-on-top  \"['<Control><Super>t']\"\n\n(that's the same shortcut than default Windows PowerToys)\n", "Q: Ubuntu 12.04 doesn't start after installing with LiveUSB I installed Ubuntu with my LiveUSB, and it said to restart in order to use your system, so I restarted.

I want to use some applications shown on the Unity Launcher in a terminal, but I need to know the appropriate command to run them. How can I achieve that?\n\nA: Most default applications will have a .desktop file located in /usr/share/applications. \nTo find out about the corresponding terminal command that will be run when launching one of these applications open the file browser Nautilus and right click on the application's icon to select Properties in the context menu. This will give you all details you need (shown here for System Settings that will run gnome-control-center -overview)\n\n\nA: First, open Synaptic by running synaptic in the terminal. Type the name of the app in the quick filter box. For an example, I'll use LibreOffice Writer. Type the name of the app in the Synaptic filter: \nIt appears as the first installed result (little green box), with the full package name libreoffice-writer in the first column.\nNow, try running libreoffice-writer in the terminal. Sometimes the package will run, but in this case it doesn't work: \nNow, if you look back at Synaptic, you will see that the very first result is the libreoffice package. You could just run libreoffice in the terminal, in which case you get this window: \nOr, you could type man libreoffice in the terminal. If you look at the these two screenshots:  \nYou can see that to directly launch LibreOffice Writer, you can use one of two commands: lowriter or libreoffice --writer. Both work equally well.\n\nA: Some programs or applications simply run by a binary. By name of application one\ncan find out where binary is located.\nwhereis name-of-application\n\nergo little example:\n$ whereis gparted\ngparted: /usr/sbin/gparted /usr/share/man/man8/gparted.8.gz\n\nYou simply can take over /usr/sbin/gparted - for to run this application gparted in entry of icon or application-name (like in cairo-dock). (in this case to run gparted root-password is necessary).\n\nA: xprop allows finding the PID of a running window, while ps allows finding command corresponding to a PID. By combining the two together, we can find a command corresponding to a window , like so :\nps --no-headers -p $(xprop | awk -F '=' '/_NET_WM_PID/{print $2}') -o cmd \n\nxprop will turn your cursor into X , which you can use to click on a window, it will return the PID, and then ps will use that PID to print the command\n\nA: That is too simple for Linux geeks.\n\n\n*\n\n*Close the application if it is open.\n\n*Open the application by clicking its icon.\nFor example, I click the icon Document Viewer.\n\n\n*\n\n*Open Terminal (ctl alt T), and run \nps -u `whoami`|tail -3\nThe answer is on the first line of ouput:\nmac2011-linux% ps -u `whoami`|tail -3\n  51252 ?        00:00:01 evince\n  53209 pts/3    00:00:00 ps\n  53211 pts/3    00:00:00 tail\n\nYes, Document Viewer is evince, not easy to guess.\n\nA: If you installed the application through the repositories or through dpkg, you can use this command:\ndpkg -l | grep \"application name\"\n\nThis will search through all your installed applications, as well as search their descriptions; searching the description is the important part here, because the description usually contains the name of the application, even if the \"command\" to run it does not contain the application name.\nExample:\nIn GNOME, there's an application called the Disk Usage Analyzer. However, the command to run it from the terminal is not disk-usage-analyzer. To find out its command, you can run:\ndpkg -l | grep \"disk usage\"\n\nThe output should contain this entry:\nalaa@aa-lu:~$ dpkg -l | grep \"disk usage\"\nii  baobab            3.6.4-0ubuntu1          i386         GNOME disk usage analyzer\n\nLook at the second column. The command to actually run the Disk Usage Analyzer is baobab.\n\nA: What you can do is use xprop: it will let you click on a application and display information. To get the name, enter in a terminal:\nxprop | grep WM_CLASS\n\nif WM_CLASS doesn't work, then try with WM_COMMAND.\n\nA: From https://specifications.freedesktop.org/desktop-entry-spec/desktop-entry-spec-latest.html:\nBasically when you install an app, a .desktop file is generated somewhere. This .desktop file is what tells the desktop environment which command to run. There are many .desktop files scattered around the file system. Their locations are specified by the $XDG_DATA_DIRS environment variable, although most of them are in a subdirectory called \"applications\" in the paths specified in $XDG_DATA_DIRS. So you basically have to go through all of those files, check one by one the name of the app specified in them, and once you finally find the one with the name of your app you check the \"Exec\" key in them.\nThis super long command does that automatically for you. Just make sure to specify the name of the program to search for at the beginning and then run it in a terminal (PS: You can open a terminal with Ctrl+Shift+T).\nNameOfProgramToSearchFor='CopyQ' && \\\nfind $(tr ':' ' ' <<<\"$XDG_DATA_DIRS\") \\\n-name '*.desktop' \\\n-exec grep -e '^Name=' -e '^Exec=' {} \\; 2>/dev/null |\ngrep -i -A 1 \"^Name=.*$NameOfProgramToSearchFor.*$\"\n\nOr you can just do what @Takkat said. In my case his solution didn't work because I couldn't find the \"Properties\" button in the right click menu, since I am using Zorin OS and it doesn't show that option. Zorin OS is based on Ubuntu, so I can't really tell if this is just a Zorin OS thing or it's that @Takkat used an older version of Ubuntu.\n", "Q: VPN connection is not working properly after installing 12.04 I've done a clean install of Ubuntu Precise.\nI'm living in a country in which my access to many websites are restricted and I usually use VPN connections to access these websites.

I have unlock and set the password for root but while login i can not see 'other' option in GUI login where i can put root id and password.\nplease help me.\n\nA: Caveat: Don't do this unless you have a good reason\nI store my home directory in lvm and occasionally need to unmount it to perform maintenance. It's much more convenient to login as root in those circumstances, as I can look up documentation online and browse the web while waiting for fsck.\nBy default, Ubuntu's greeter LightDM no longer supports logging in with an arbitrary username as it did in the past.\n\nBut this is still Linux, and we can configure this.

Hope this helps! :)\nNote: Try sudo nautilus also, so you can explore folders and file in the GUI.\n\nA: This is not possible (without a lot of work manually overriding stuff) because it is pretty much always a bad idea.\nIn this question, there is a good discussion about the many things that can go wrong if you log in as root.  Many things won't work at all.  Other things won't work as expected.  If you do anything wrong, you could destroy all the data on your computer.  It makes your computer more vulnerable than windows to malicious attacks.\nIn all cases I've ever heard of, when a person is asking how to log in as root, they are trying to log in as root to accomplish something that could be better done without logging in as root.  \nAs such, I recommend editing the question to ask how do best accomplish whatever you are actually trying to accomplish.  We'd be happy to help you get to your goals :)\n\nA: To do that you should try writing these on the terminal window (ctrl+T):\nsudo su\npasswd\n\nFor the first command you will probably have to type in your password. The second will set your root password to whatever you enter.\n\nA: As far as I know you can't login as root at the GUI login screen and it would be a bad idea anyway. Juan's answer is correct - you can launch a terminal and sudo su to root user (if you are in the sudoers group) and then launch a program which uses a GUI if you wish. \n\nA: First:\nTo actually enable root logins, first you have to set a password for the root account, and then unlock the locked root account. \nIf you don't set a password for the root account the passwd command will return \n`passwd: Unlocking the password would result in a passwordless account`\n\nSo, first execute in a terminal \nsudo passwd root\nyou will prompted for a new Unix password. Write it twice(second for confirmation).\nThen execute\nsudo passwd -u root \nto unlock the account. This should return \npasswd: password expiry information changed\nReverting back\nIf you want to disable root account in Ubuntu you need to lock the root account by using the following command sudo passwd -l root\nSecond:\nOpen the terminal:and type\ngksudo gedit /etc/ect/lightdm/lightdm.config\n(Orignal ) this it what it should already look like:\n[SeatDefaults] \ngreeter-session=unity-greeter          \nuser-session=unity                         \ngreeter-show-manual-login=true \ngreeter-show-manual-login=true \n\n(What you need to replace the orignal with)\n[SeatDefaults] \nautologin-user=<YOUR USER> \nautologin-user-timeout=0 \nuser-session=ubuntu \ngreeter-session=unity-greeter\n\nYou will auto-log into root\n\nA: Please follow the steps:\nbefore doing any changes please take the backup:\nmkdir bakup\ncp /etc/gdm3/custom.conf backup/\ncp /etc/pam.d/gdm-password backup/\n\n\nsudo nano /etc/gdm3/custom.conf\n\nAnd add the following line in the [security] directive and save the file.\n[security]\n\nAllowRoot=true\n\n[xdmcp]\n\nThen Save it\n\nNow run sudo nano /etc/pam.d/gdm-password file. And add the hash (#) sign to the start of the following line and save the file:\n#auth required pam_succeed_if.so user !=root quiet_success\n\nTo apply these changes, we have to restart the system. After the restart, login from the root account again and verify that the root account is enabled.\n\nA: $sudo -i\nenter the password\nsu\nstartx\nA new desktop screen with GUI root account will emerge. The previous desktop though still remains alive for use after you log off the root account. I feel that this way of accessing the root in GUI is better that creating a permanent GUI account of root.\n", "Q: Unauthenticated packages after upgrade to 12.04 I upgraded an 11.10 box to 12.04 yesterday.

Thanks!\n\nA: At gertvdijk mentioned above in the comment, running:\nsudo apt-get update \n\nbefore running \nsudo apt-get upgrade\n\nwill fix this, if you haven't run \"update\" recently.\nSo the next question for me was, \"what does the 'apt-get update' command do, and why would it matter to run it before an upgrade?\"  After all, the system seems to know that updates are available, so what gives?\nI noticed that the first few things that were downloaded by update were 'Release.gpg' files, and googling for that filename I found this:\nhttp://wiki.debian.org/SecureApt\nwhich states about the \"WARNING: The following packages cannot be authenticated!\" error, \"This means that the archive has begun to be signed by a new key, which your system does not know about.\"\nAdditionally, the apt-get manpage says:\nupdate is used to resynchronize the package index files \nfrom their sources. The indexes of available packages are fetched \nfrom the location(s) specified in /etc/apt/sources.list. For \nexample, when using a Debian archive, this command retrieves \nand scans the Packages.gz files, so that information about new \nand updated packages is available. An update should always be \nperformed before an upgrade or dist-upgrade.\nNote the last sentence there.  I had totally forgotten about that.\nSo it seems this warning simply indicates that the package index files are out of date, because the update information includes security information that helps you know that the upgrades you are downloading are, in fact, upgrades, and not horrible trojan horses that will turn your system into a spamming botnet zombie.\nYou can read the SecureApt page for details about how the packages are securely signed, and the chain of trust.\nThis all makes sense then, but now the question becomes, \"what is apt-get upgrade seeing when it tries to do an upgrade with an outdated package list? How does it know there are newer versions if the package list isn't current?\"\n... (out of steam for research for now!)\n\nA: I believe this can happen if you have added repositories to your sources.list. Nevertheless, here are two threads you'll find helpful:\nubuntu forums thread re: the same error message\nproposed fix for your problem\n\nA: This can happen if you have a DNS issue or other potential networking issues that may block the traffic when running an update. It is possible that the requests may appear to succeed when running apt-get update and then only appear when apt-get upgrade has issues. \nI found that my transparent HTTP proxy was blocking some of the requests and had to modify that proxy to permit the traffic. Details are in bug 574886.\nAfter fixing my network issues, simply running apt-get update cleaned up and apt-get upgrade ran as expected.\n", "Q: What does this error mean: “maverick is not supported.” when installing AppScale?

So, the question seems to be: How to install older VGA drivers?\n", "Q: How do I configure the gnome panel from a script? I can easily set the number of workspaces and the workspace names with the gconftool-2, as follows:\n  gconftool-2 --type int --set /apps/metacity/general/num_workspaces 4\n  gconftool-2 --type string --set /apps/metacity/workspace_names/name_1 Dev\n  gconftool-2 --type string --set /apps/metacity/workspace_names/name_2 Docs\n  gconftool-2 --type string --set /apps/metacity/workspace_names/name_3 VM\n  gconftool-2 --type string --set /apps/metacity/workspace_names/name_4 Web\n\nHowever, for some reason I am unable to use similar techniques to set the number of rows in the workspace switcher, or set the preference to show workspace names.  I am similarly unable to add applets and launchers via gconftool.  I would also like to be able to configure my system to have just one panel at the bottom of the screen. (Solved this much)\nI have reviewed the using gconf page without success.  For some options, I have been successfully able to find the option name by dumping gconftool-2 -R / to a file, change the option via the GUI, and then dump again and diff. This technique was not fruitful with the above mentioned items.  I have also tried --dump and --load, and have tried restarting gnome-panel and gconfd-2, but that does not help either.  Is there some other mechanism besides gconftool-2 that the panel uses for storing settings?\nI am currently using 11.10 in gnome-classic mode.\nUpdate: Found a script to hide panels.\nUpdate 2: An easier way to remove the top panel:\ngsettings set org.gnome.gnome-panel.layout toplevel-id-list \"['bottom-panel']\"\n\n\nI actually still cannot configure the panel with dconf. \nI can change an existing panel item to point to a different program via dconf write /org/gnome/gnome-panel/layout/objects/object-6/instance-config/location \"'...'\", but killall -HUP gnome-panel is also required. \nIf I try to remove an item from the panel via dconf write /org/gnome/gnome-panel/layout/objects/object-id-list \"[...]\", the contents of the panel do not change, even after restarting gnome panel. \nIf I make the same change with dconf-editor, it changes immediately. \nWhat do I need to do to update the panel after dconf write?\n(Note: behaves the same way under 12.04)\n\nA: Although gsettings cannot change schemaless keys in dconf, dconf can. You do not need to write your own program. What you can do to change the number of rows in the workspace switcher is:\n\n*\n\n*install the dconf-tool package\n\n*run dconf as \n\ndconf write /org/gnome/gnome-panel/layout/objects/workspace-switcher/instance-config/num-rows 2\n  \n  You can play with lots of other gnome-panel entries with dconf-editor as well.\n\n\nA: It turns out that some gnome preferences are stored in gconf, and may be edited via gconftool-2, while others are stored in dconf, which may be edited via gesttings.  See: How do I change dconf keys without a gui.\nUpdate: Unfortunately, I quickly ran into the problem described in this bug report: no way to set a schemaless key using gsettings.  Many of the preferences that I want to set are schemaless keys stored in the binary file ~/.config/dconf/user, and it seems there is no way to edit these short of via the internal dconf APIs -- so you'd have to write a C program to do it.\n", "Q: After 11.10 > 12.04 upgrade on Thinkpad W520 - mouse input broken After upgrading from 11.10 to 12.04 on a Thinkpad W520 system all mouse/pointer input devices (on this machine that includes the so-called 'TrackPoint pointing stick', a 'TouchPad', and, what I actually use, a generic wireless USB mouse) fail to work properly if the laptop is in it's docking station. The pointer is 'stuck' along the left edge of the screen. The pointer can be moved vertically, but not horizontally. If the laptop is removed from it's docking station then 'mouse' devices appear to function normally.\nExamining /etc/X11/xorg.conf I see that the 'upgrade-manager' has commented out all the traditional configuration for the mouse (and keyboard) with a pointer to /etc/default/console-setup. Looking there, I find nothing that seems to refer to mouse configuration.\nTrolling /var/logs and dmesg for complaints about 'mouse' doesn't turn up anything.\nIn previous Ubuntu releases, I have not needed to do anything for the docking station to work.\nFWIW, my normal set up is the laptop in a docking station with two ViewSonic VX2450wm LED monitors in a 'twinview' mode, and a wireless USB keyboard. The laptop itself has a Nvidia Quadro 1000M graphics device. None of the mouse devices are attached to the docking station.\nI'm not sure how or why the docking station relates to mouse input, but it clearly has some impact.\nThis seems like something way too basic to just stop working on an upgrade, but I'm at a loss to see what the upgrade has messed up. Any suggestions of what to look at would be very much appreciated.\n\nA: Probably your best option would be to go to your system preferences, then go to \"Additional Drivers\" and installing the correct driver.\n", "Q: Can I upgrade from 8.04 to 12.04?

In the menus for Calc there is \"Window\" and within that menu is \"Freeze\" which allows you to freeze rows so when scrolling down it stays on top. However, when I press \"Alt\" and type \"Freeze\" nothing comes up. There is not even a \"Window\" menu option (lo-menubar installed).\nWhy is this not on LibreOffice on Ubuntu but on Windows? But I want to know is how can I get this feature. I find it really handy.\nThank you for your time and answers.\n\nA: I too had the same trouble even after upgrading to 3.5.4. After some effort I found a method to freeze the Calc. Go to Tools > Customize Keyboard. In the functions category click the option view. The option to freeze windows will appear in the function category. Make a short cut key for that, for example Ctrl+3.The freeze option is activated. Hopefully we can manage with this until the bug is fixed.\n\nA: There is a bug open with the problem being lo-menubar.\nThe Window menu option reappears when this is removed, although of course you loose the global menu bars in LibreOffice as well.\n", "Q: GNOME Shell issue with application icons using themes I've installed GNOME Shell extensions for Precise (12.04) using the instructions detailed in WebUpd8.

I found a fix in this link:\nhttp://gnome-shell.deviantart.com/journal/GNOME-3-4-And-Theme-Changes-290145428\nJust edit the .css file of the theme you are using so it matches this values:\n.icon-grid {\n    spacing: 36px; /* 36px */\n    -shell-grid-horizontal-item-size: 118px; /* 118px */\n    -shell-grid-vertical-item-size: 118px; /* 118px */\n}\n\nThe file is located inside the folder .themes, in your home folder. In my case it is /home/.themes/Nord/gnome-shell/apps.css\nFor other themes the name of the file you have to edit is gnome-shell.css\nIt worked for me, hope it helps.\n\nA: Not every theme is compatible with Gnome shell 3.4 , when you use compatible themes, this problem wont come. For example: install these themes - http://www.webupd8.org/2012/04/zukitwo-zukini-holo-theme-packs-updated.html . They work fine. \n\nA: I also had this problem recently after upgrading to 12.04. It's possible that you are still using old themes:\nAs I already had local themes installed in my ~/.themes directory, I didn't realize that a slight change in one css instruction for the new 3.4 theme file (~/.themes/Adwaita-White/gnome-shell/gnome-shell.css) was affecting the whole thing:\n(old theme in Gnome <=3.3)  \n    .icon-grid {  \n        spacing: 36px; /* 36px */  \n        -shell-grid-item-size: 118px; /* 118px */  \n    }\n(new theme in Gnome 3.4)  \n    .icon-grid {  \n        spacing: 36px; /* 36px */  \n        -shell-grid-**horizontal**-item-size: 118px; /* 118px */  \n        -shell-grid-**vertical**-item-size: 118px; /* 118px */  \n    }\n\n\nA: It's not just a few lines to get 3.2 themes to work in 3.4. What you're asking is to fix the overview, which is only a few changed lines. \nThe rest of the theme needs fixing because of CSS changes from 3.2 to 3.4, like dash panel tooltips.\nSomeone should contribute properly and update the themes if they're shipping with distros because I don't use GNOME any more.\n", "Q: error: parsing file '/var/lib/dpkg/status' near line 55497 package 'indicator-displex' After running an upgrade from Ubuntu 11.10 (Oneiric Ocelot) to 12.04LTS (Precise Pangolin), a window popped up saying that the upgrade failed and that I should run sudo dpkg --configure -a.\nRunning that command gave me:\nsudo dpkg --configure -a\ndpkg: error: parsing file '/var/lib/dpkg/status' near line 55497 package 'indicator-displex':\n blank line in value of field 'Description\n\nTrying to run apt-get install -f gives me many dependency errors along with that same dpkg error.\n\nA: After looking at the file mentioned in the error /var/lib/dpkg/status on line 55497, I saw this:\nPackage: indicator-displex\nPriority: optional\nSection: GTK, system, admin\nInstalled-Size: 1524\nMaintainer: Arick McNiel <arickmcniel AT yahoo DOT com>\nArchitecture: all\nVersion: 0.1\nDepends: python, python-gtk2, python-central (>= 0.6.1), python-notify, python-appindicator, compiz\nSize: 130748\nDescription: DisPlex\n AppIndicator to interface with Compiz / Xrandr / Emerald.\n .\n The Displex (indicator-displex) application provides an AppIndicator to the display\n interfaces of Compiz / Emerald / and Gnome Display Manager.

When you plug it back in, a notification should pop up (on your Ubuntu system) saying it has connected to a wired network. (If the notification does not appear, make sure Personal Hotspot is enabled on your phone.)\nThis works for me with a non-jailbroken iPhone running iOS 5.0 and no additional software on either my laptop or phone.\n\nA: Installing the usbmuxd package solved the issue with iphone 7 and 17.10.\n", "Q: Dell Studio 1737 Overheating I am using a Dell Studio 1737 laptop. I have been running Linux and have ran Windows recently for a very long time. I upgraded to the 10.10 distribution and since that distro, it seems that for some reason all Linuxes want to push my laptop to extremes. I have recently upgraded to Ubuntu 12.04 since I heart that it contains kernel fixes for overheating issues. 12.04 will actually eventually cool the system, but that is after the fans run to the point it sounds like a jet aircraft taking off and the laptop makes my hands sweat.\nIn trying to combat the heat problems I have done the following:\nI installed the propriatery driver for my ATI Mobility HD 3600. I have tried both the one in the Additional Drivers and also tried ATI's latest greatest version. If I don't install this my laptop will overheat and shut off in minutes. Both seem to perform similarly, but the heat problem remains.\nI have tried limiting the CPU by installing the CPUFreq Indicator. This does help keep the machine from shutting off, but the heat is still uncomfortable to be around the machine. I usually run in power saver mode or run the cpu at 1.6 GHZ just to error on safety.\nI ran sensors-detect and here are the results:\nsean@sean-Studio-1737:~$ sudo sensors-detect # sensors-detect revision 5984 (2011-07-10 21:22:53 +0200) # System: Dell Inc.

The Intel HD 3000 is. That means that if you're using Unity 3D now, it's the Intel card which is in use.\nAnd the fact The Graphics Driver name does not appear in Systems Settings (Details), stipulates there is some conflict between drivers (Proprietary drivers of Nvidia or Nouveau).\nPurging them and reinstalling bumblebee seems a solution (Bumblebee will resintall Nvidia drivers nvidia-current for you).\nThe correct result should look this:\n\nOR:\n\nYou quoted : \"And if I go to System Settings > Additional Drivers, it returned nothing in the list and only with a description \"No proprietary drivers are in use on this system\".\"  -> This is normal when you install Bumblebee and normal when the Nvidia card is not activated and not recognized by the system.

I followed. My battery issue is fixed. It went up 1-2 hours extra. Power consumption reduced from ~2500mA to ~1500mA.\nThen, I found this telling us to install mesa-utils in order to fix \"Graphics > Driver Unknown\" issue. I followed.

It has several features built in upon install such as Squid, php5, mysql, etc. \nThe thing is this: we see that the OS might have some corrupted crucial data structures. The system is now no longer usable. For instance, upon booting up, it complains a lot of \"segmentation fault\" and several commands have [fail] instead of [ok]. The list is just huge and let's just say that we can't do anything from there any more. We can't even log in. When you log in as root, the OS simply bounces you back, asking you for your username again and again, in an infinite loop.\nSo, now, we want to at least recover our mandatory files. We basically use a live CD, boot it up and see things in our hard disk. But the mandatory directory: \"mysql\" located at var/lib/ is inaccessible. On the window GUI, the directory is visible but it has a rectangle with an X on it. When trying to access, copy or compress the directory, a message box popped up and complained that we do not have the privilege to do such action. Sounds like a privilege problem? Well, we simply turn on the terminal and navigate to the var/lib/ directory, hoping to do some simple chmod. However, what is shocking is the mysql directory is INVISIBLE. ls command does not list it out. Using some directory check bash command, the program says that there is no mysql directory to be found as well. And all these commands are already under root privilege.\nSo in this problem, we want to retrieve everything in the mysql directory via Live CD. How do we accomplish this?\n\nA: I think you mounted the root directory with your live cd, but forgot to mount /var where the mysql data lives, and that why you couldn't see the mysql data. Find which partition /var was mount on and mount it, and the mysql data should be there.\n\nA: We have consulted with the software developer ourselves, and it turned out that they embedded homebrew scripts to prevent typical users from messing with their crucial stuff. \nWe simply turn the machine in to their company and let them fix it...\n", "Q: No sound in World of Goo?

ATI Driver is screwed up I am not a noob to Linux, but I am sure as heck not a pro. 12.04 has nearly all the 'tweaks' out of the box, that I had to manually do myself with prior ubuntu releases, and I am grateful for this. BUT:\nI installed 12.04 on my SONY VAIO VPCEE23FX yesterday, and after fooling with unity, ultimately decided o go back to GNOME Classic. Unity was all-new to me (I resisted upgrading to 11.10 cuz of it) and so I didn't really notice any change in resolution.\nHowever, as soon as I went back to GNOME Classic, I saw the change. Even though my resolution is correct (according to 'Displays') at 1366 x 786 (16x9), everything appears bigger and pudgier. The clarity is just fine. Words are sharp as ever, and there is no fuzzy or blurred effect anywhere, but windows are bigger, menus are bigger; basically it cut my workspace size in half, because everything takes up more space now.\nBack in the day, when I installed 11.04, I was able to use the third-party ATI drivers from the 'Additional Drivers' tool for my SONY and they worked great. Even with Dual-monitors thru VGA. I knew I would have to use them for 12.04 too, in order to have the graphic acceleration I should get. However, the ATI post-release package fails to install (something about var/log/ blah blah) and the other ATI release installs, but royally screws up my dual-monitor set-up. (resolution parameters are wrong error messages galore, et cetera)\nBottom line: ATI Drivers aren't working right (I need those two screens) Ubuntu's drivers seem to be getting the resolution just fine, yet everything is bloated and bigger than it used to be. So big that it bugs me, because I know how much space I used to have on my desktop for windows and such. Also, even when I have the proprietary ATI driver installed and activated, my resolution options are the same as generic, and everything is just as bloated as without the ATI driver.\nIt is at least, clear and legible, but I know that two days from now, I'm gonna be cursing at my workspace because I don't have the room I used to, and get my shorts in a knot because I feel claustrophobic.\nI have no idea how to fix the ATI errors with dual-monitors, and I have no other resolution options with the generic driver that can tighten the windows with the max 1366x786.\nI am horrible at generating error codes and tracking outputs. I can't diagnose problems to save my life using scripts. I usually copy the error bubble, and Google the heck out of it. This time, because 12.04 is new, my lack of skill profits me even less.\nHelp?\n\nA: Since your resolution appears to be set to the display's native one, try forcing the DPI setting to 96 or less. It should apply to window dimensions and font sizes in most applications.\nI'm using XFCE, the graphical interface to change the DPI setting is xfce4-appearance-settings.\nFor Gnome 2, this seems to do it:\nIs it possible to change font DPI in 11.04?\nAnd for Gnome 3:\nHow do I change the font DPI settings?\n", "Q: Is it safe to remove ubuntu-desktop package? I prefer using Synaptic to Software Center. So I decide to remove the software-center package, but ubuntu-desktop needs to be removed as well. A warning is shown, saying ubuntu-desktop is needed to ensure proper updates. \nTo which extent doesubuntu-desktop effect on updates?\n\nLet's say I removed ubuntu-desktop then my Ubuntu would be treated as server mode. So does that means I'll get updates geared toward server i.e. I'll get packages that unnecessary for my desktop?\n\nA: Ubuntu-Desktop is a meta package. It does nothing by itself. Meta packages exist as containers depending on a number of other packages, which belong to a standard installation. You can safely remove ubuntu-desktop. Nothing bad will happen.\nHowever, if you upgrade to a later version of Ubuntu, the meta packages reflect the new list of standard applications. If Canonical should ever decided to drop software-center and include AptDeluxe instead, the meta package takes care of that during the upgrade. Worst thing that can happen, is that an upgrade takes manual work, or that some packages will not received (automatic) updates (because conflicts cannot be resolved); the latter may be a security issue. \nI'd recommend to keep those meta packages installed, which provide a set of applications that you would typically want. If software-center is the only package from ubuntu-desktop that you don't need, I'd keep ubuntu-desktop because Software Center causes no harm (to my knowledge). However, if there's more bloat that you want to get rid of and you don't mind the possible, future issues, removing ubuntu-desktop is the right thing to do.\n\nA: You can safely remove ubuntu-desktop without affecting upgrades:\nAccording to the source:\n\nA server install has more freedoms, for a desktop install\n          we force a desktop meta package to be install on the upgrade.\nWe look for a installed desktop meta pkg and for key \n          dependencies, if none of those are installed we assume\n          server mode\n\n", "Q: Problem connecting multiple monitors on 12.04; Problema al conectar monitores Ubuntu 12.04 LTS Possible Translation:\nI did some configurations with compiz, nothing to crash(?) unity.

Yesterday I upgraded from Ubuntu 11.10 to 12.04. The upgrade went smoothly. I did a restart and then strange things started to happen.\nAfter each upgrade I set my Ubuntu to automatic login(been upgrading from 10.04 until now without a fresh installation, always 64-bit). As expected yesterday the login window appeared. The first thing that caught my eye were the lines below my user name. They say \"No value has been set\". Then I type in my password as usual. And then the big one: \"Invalid password, please try again\"!\nFrom that time on I tried a couple of things:\n\n\n*\n\n*Tried my different passwords. I always use the same password for Ubuntu but still I gave it a shot.\n\n*My default language in Ubuntu is English. That is different from my keyboard layout that has a Slovenian layout. It has been a problem before that our Slovenian layout keyboard and English OS don't always cooperate as they should. That is the reason my Ubuntu password has only numbers and English letters. So I tried the on screen keyboard in Ubuntu to click my way through the login again no success.\n\n*Then I tried to change my password. I followed these instructions. First through GRUB. After typing in \"passwd myusername\" I got a puzzling response. The terminal said:\npasswd: Authentication token manipulation error\npasswd: password unchanged\nThe file system state was read/write because I used fsck command before going into root. Then I tried the second option with the Live CD. Erased the password from the shadow file but still no success logging in Ubuntu.\n\n\nThen there is the thing with the Guest session account. No matter which option I choose (Ubuntu, Ubuntu 2D.) and login nothing happens. The screen goes blank for 3 seconds, the hard disk makes some noise and the login screen comes back on.\nNow I don't know what to do next. I have a dual-boot system and Win7 boots up without problems. Ubuntu 11.04 runs great from Live CD. I did a memtest just to be sure and there were no errors. So I am kind of certain it is not a hardware problem.\nLink to the contents of lightdm.log. \nIf you require any further information or if I was unclear please let me know!\nWhat else can I do?\n\nA: I had a similar problem. After upgrading to 12.04, I could not login anymore, neither from the GUI nor from the console. After booting in recoverymode (see here) and mounting / read-write, changing the password via passwdusername  seemed to work, but I still could not login afterwards.\nThe problem was in /etc/passwd. My shell was set to /usr/bin/tcsh, which does no longer work. It must be /bin/sh. (I personally find it sad that Ubuntu forces me now to use this shell, but I can workaround it).\nBy the way, I found it because I deleted the user via userdelusername and recreated the user useraddusername, and afterwards it worked. I had to fix the user and group number in passwd manually afterwards, that is the exact steps were:\n\n\n*\n\n*move home directory to somewhere else (to avoid that userdel would remove it)\n\n*look into /etc/passwd and write down the group and user number (normally 1000)\n\n*userdel myusername\n\n*useradd myusername\n\n*passwd myusername\n\n*edit /etc/passwd to ensure that the group and user number is still the same\n\n*move home directory back to its original plase\n\n*login myusername => to test that it works now\n\n\nThen I saw that the shell changed and I tried to change the shell (useradd -s /usr/bin/tcsh myusername) and then nothing worked again. So, stick with /bin/sh.\n", "Q: Can't see boot option I have Dell-GX260 I installed latest ubuntu after windows 7, by selecting side by side option, everything finished well but when pc restarted, then automatically it loaded windows 7 without giving me option to choose between windows 7 or ubuntu.

The default for nvidia has no power management, so people may switch to the proprietary driver if battery life on a laptop is important to them, but nvidia's drivers (being closed source) may not play nice with Ubuntu (leading to display issues like tearing in video).  \nIf you want the nvidia driver, type in the terminal sudo apt-get install nvidia-current.  After installing the driver, you'll need to enable brightness controls in /etc/X11/xorg.conf.  \nIn /etc/X11/xorg.conf you should put:\nSection \"Device\"\n    Identifier     \"NVIDIA GeForce\"\n    Driver         \"nvidia\"\n    Option         \"NoLogo\" \"True\"\n    Option         \"RegistryDwords\" \"EnableBrightnessControl=1\"\nEndSection\n\n\"Identifier\" is not so important unless you have other stuff referring to this device in your conf file.  You can replace with more appropriate name if it's not an Nvidia GeForce type card.  Everything else must be as written; \"NoLogo\" is to avoid the annoying Nvidia splash screen.  \nTo edit the file using a GUI text editor, type gksudo gedit /etc/X11/xorg.conf in the terminal.  Save changes and reboot... if all went well, you will now be using the new driver and brightness controls will work!  If it doesn't work, you can check if you're using the new driver by typing in the terminal lspci -v | grep -i -A 15 vga.  You should get something like:\n02:00.0 VGA compatible controller: NVIDIA Corporation Device 08a3 (rev a2) (prog-if 00 [VGA controller])\n[some lines omitted....]\nKernel driver in use: nvidia\nKernel modules: nvidia_current, nouveau, nvidiafb\n\nKernel drive in use should be nvidia, not nouveau.  \n", "Q: Ubuntu 12.04 does not recognise CD ~$ wodim --devices\nwodim: Overview of accessible drives (1 found) :\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------\n 0  dev='/dev/sg1'  rwrw-- : 'MATSHITA' 'DVD-RAM UJ8B1AS'\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nBut I don't find access to CD.\nKindly let me know how to rip the CD.\nWhen I try to mount, it gives error.\n~$ mount /dev/sg1\ncan't find /dev/sg1 in /etc/fstab or /etc/mtab\n\n\nA: If the CD is not showing up in the graphical user interface, then try mounting it via the terminal\nsudo mount /dev/sg1\n\nIf that doesn't work, then my suggestion would be to update your fstab file.

You can't put folders in launcher in easy way, so how you access folders or files in fast and easy way?\n\nA: One fast way is to use Super+F. That will give you your bookmarked folders first, and then folders based on usage. How recent and how frequently you use them. \nSo my recommendation is that you only bookmark the very important folders, and let the system provide you with folders that you use frequently anyway. If you have too many Nautilus bookmarks, the Quicklist menu might become cumbersome to use. The Files lens is better suited for those situations.\nIn Nautilus, you can also use HUD to access bookmarks since they're listed in the menu. Tap Alt and start typing its name. \n\nA: Nautilus Bookmarks\nTo add a directory to our bookmarks for quick access we open the directory with the file browser Nautilus and select Bookmarks -> Add Bookmark from the panel menu.\n\nAfter that we will find this directory in the list of bookmarked directories in the left side panel, and also in the launcher right-click quicklist.\n\n\nA: In 12.04, right click the launcher icon for the file manager Nautilus if it is on your launcher. Here, it should have a list of folders...I can't tell you off the top of my head what the defaults are. If you would like to add more items to this Quicklist, simply bookmark any folder that you want using the bookmark command in Nautilus. It will update as you add new ones.\n\nA: One of the quickest ways is to install Gnome-Do, just from the software center. It is a small pop-up launcher, which interpretes what you type (similar as unity). \nHowever, unlike unity, typing the name of a folder and hitting enter brings you directly to that folder. So in my case: hitting space+shift, typing folder name, hitting enter. Can you do quicker? :-)\n\nA: You could create shortcuts and put them on your desktop.\n\nA: Right click on a folder and click \"make link\". A fake file/folder will be created which you can move wherever you want, I am assuming on your Desktop. \nWhen you click it the original file/folder will open. This is basically the same functionality as the Windows \"make shortcut\" feature.\n", "Q: Fullscreen gnome classic ubuntu 12.04 I have just moved into 12.04 and exploring gnome classic I have realized that when fullscreen youtube the top panel and the inferior panel remains there. \nThis happens also in VLC, but first everythin seems ok and after one minute or so it happens the same thing than in youtube.\n\nA: \nIf you have no use for Place Windows simply unticking this compiz plugin from compizconfig-settings-manager will allow you to see flash full screen without the panels for borders.\nThere is a bug-report for this issue:\nhttps://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/gnome-session/+bug/977438\nThe suggestion in the report is to delete the Gnome-Clock applet as this is known to cause this issue.\nAlternatively - use gnome-classic (no effects) to display full-screen flash videos.\n\nA: I have the same issue. It's not an ideal fix but I work around the problem by setting the panels to autohide whenever I want to use full screen mode for a reasonable period of time i.e. when watching a film\n\nA: Removing the Windows Selector or Windows List from the Panel fixes the problem but you then have no way to switch between windows. \n\nA: you have to remove bottom panel.

On the right side of the various volume controls, you should see an \"automute mode\". Simply tap the up arrow key on your keyboard to enable it, and then press escape. \nIf there is no \"automute mode\" on the mixer, then you can manually mute the speakers when you have your headphones plugged in, by simply highlighting the channel that has the speakers attached and pressing the \"m\" key. \nFor future reference, please post the specific hardware you are using when you're having a problem.

When installing it, I switched to \"high contrast\" mode, which has rather large cursors (by large I mean about twice as large and thick as they should normally are).\nNow I have successfully installed the partition, the large cursors have stuck around even after exiting this high contrast mode, but only when I am hovering over stuff e.g. hovering over text inputs, links, and when resizing windows.

Is it possible to convert a 2D video to 3D on Linux?\nThere are several ways on Windows, one is using an AviSynth script.\nI tried opening the script with avconv.exe and VirtualDub with Wine and AviSynth, but it fails to load AviSynth.dll.\n\nA: I installed AviSynth with Wine 1.3.16 through PlayOnLinux, then I chose \"System\" version. I replaced DirectShowSource with AviSource in the script and I could open the script with VirtualDub.\n\nA: One software that can help you is Bino.

I upgraded to 12.04 (64 bit) today, so far so good, everything worked great, until I tried doing some more advanced stuff.\nWhen I tried adding the toolchain-test ppa, I got a mismatch on distribution. After a try or 4 this changed and linked me to this bug report. So far so good, a weird error but I'm not the only one and it will get fixed right?\nBut I found it a very weird error, and I also noticed some other (custom) apps behaving weird concerning my distribution version. So I tried to find out what release I'm running, these are the results I got:\n>:~$ lsb_release -a\nNo LSB modules are available.\nDistributor ID: Ubuntu\nDescription:    Ubuntu quantal (development branch)\nRelease:    12.10\nCodename:   quantal\n\n>:~$ cat /etc/issue\nUbuntu quantal (development branch) \\n \\l\n\nNow I'm wondering: did I do something wrong on installation? Did I accidentally download some weird nightly, set up wrong repositories, ...? Or is this simply a bug in some small part of the system that does the reporting wrong and maybe will confuse an app or two?\nNow, whatever the reason: is there a simple way I can set this release information to the correct version again?\n\nA: I had the exact same problem. In my case it was due to the fact that I had the ppa:ubuntu-toolchain-r/test enabled and even though only precise was listed as the series, the base-files package in there seems to belong to quantal. To find out from where the misbehaving base-files package is installed, use the following command:\n$ apt-cache policy base-files\n\nFind the line where the version matches the installed version and inspect the URL that is reported for that version.\nIf you want to keep the PPA enabled (e.g. because you want/must use the gcc-4.7 compiler), you can use apt-pinning to force the system into keeping the base-files package while allowing you to install gcc-4.7. Create the file /etc/apt/preferences.d/base-files (make sure not to use any dots in the name) with the following content:\nPackage: base-files\nPin: release o=Ubuntu\nPin-Priority: 1001\n\nThis will force a downgrade of the base-files package to its default version (from the main ubuntu repository) on the next upgrade.\nBe extra careful about typographical errors, particularly spaces and capitalization.\nOnce the file is in place, use apt-cache policy base-files to determine the Candidate version. It should correspond to the version that is listed next to the default Ubuntu archive. Finally, start the downgrade:\n$ sudo apt-get upgrade\n\nWhen asked whether you really want to DOWNGRADE (capitalization not mine...), answer with y+Enter.\n\nA: As far as I know, once a package is upgraded it cannot be downgraded, with the exception being a procedure like REMOVE PACKAGE- > CHANGE REPO- > UPDATE APT -> REINSTALL OLD PACKAGE. Which is a quite odd procedure, as sometimes there are some dependencies and version issues.\nAnyway, go to /etc/apt/sources.list and /etc/apt/sources.list.d/*.list and see if there are some rows containing the word \"quantal\".\nIf there are, then that's the problem. I would suggest you backup everything and reinstall a clean stable version. The other solution would be to change all the \"quantal\" words in \"precise\", re-update repos and hope that all of the quantal packages will be replaced with a more up-to-date precise version. But it's a VERY BAD solution!\n", "Q: Upgrading Mythbuntu 10.10 to 12.04 Hoping for some pointers to the right upgrade path for upgrading my working 10.10 Mythbuntu system to 12.04 of the same.  \nThe notes for 12.04 say to ensure you've upgraded to mythtv .25, via the specially provided PPA's but not sure at what point is best to do that?\nAny one doing this?  Any pointers/gotcha's?\nAny help appreciated; googling and FAQ's have not been much help with a version this 'old'.. :-)\n\nA: A few notes:\n1) Upgrading directly from 10.10 to 12.04 isn't supported. You would need to upgrade to 11.04, then 11.10, then 12.04. At this point, probably better/easier to backup everything, install 12.04, then restore everything. (I usually recommend a fresh install anyway)\n2) Upgrading to 12.04 will upgrade MythTV to 0.25 at the same time (0.25 ships with 12.04). That said, I've seen numerous recommendations that you shouldn't upgrade both at the same time and that you should upgrade MythTV first, then upgrade the distro. (I usually run the latest version of MythTV anyway, so I've personally never tested upgrading both at the same time)\n3) To upgrade the MythTV version, you will need to enable the Mythbuntu repos, select 0.25 in the Mythbuntu Control Centre, then update the machine as usual. (I recommend having this repo enabled as it gives you new builds from the MythTV fixes branch)\n", "Q: How can I install on an Asus EEE PC 900 I have an ASUS eee Pc 900 with original SSD broken.\nI want install ubuntu on the SD card.\nI use an USB pen drive as installation media.\nThe setup process start, but stop after few seconds without messages.\nThere are some parameter to set for start succesfully?\nThank you very much!\n\nA: I'm sorry to hear that you are experiencing issues with the installation process of Ubuntu, but I would need to get some more information to help troubleshoot the problem and assist you further with this...

The changes to PCM barely affects the volume level, while the Master slides does.\nThis makes the volume slider rather unusable: it's either way too low, or too loud and I can't set it properly.\nIs there a way, preferably through pulseaudio and not by rebinding my keys to use amixer (as suggested in another post here) to only change the master volume without ever touching PCM?\nI know you can play around with the /usr/share/pulseaudio/alsa-mixer/paths/analog-output.conf.common file to achieve that effect, but this does not seem to be the proper way to change this: the change will get reverted next time pulseaudio gets updated.\n\nA: After some more searching I found the following: How do I change the way Ubuntu adjusts my volume mixer levels?\nThe solution mentioned there worked for me.\n", "Q: Uncertainty involving installing GRUB and multiple hard drives My desktop computer has multiple hard drives. Here's how they're currently set up:\n\nNote the Windows 7 loader on the XP drive.\nMy plan for 12.04 was to install it over my XP/Wubi set up and dual boot just Win7 and Ubuntu. However, I'm unsure about installing GRUB2. Is the Windows 7 loader required for me to maintain a dual boot setup? If I were to format sda and install GRUB there, would I have problems? I ask because GRUB on my laptop doesn't point to Windows 7 on some partition but rather the Windows 7 loader on some partition.\n\nA: Have you got a windows 7 disc? If you do you are fine.\nFormatting the partition containing the windows bootloader will stop windows from being able to be launched. However you can reinstall the windows bootloader using the install dvd as described here:\nhttp://www.howtogeek.com/howto/33433/restore-the-windows-boot-loader-after-an-ubuntu-update/\nThis will probably mess up grub (not sure as it is on a separate hdd) which you can recover as described here:\nhttp://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=1014708\n", "Q: What is the difference between upgrading from 11.10 and updating from 12.04 beta 2? i have ubuntu 11.10 installed and ubuntu 12.04 beta also installed  in the same machine.\nis there a difference between: \nupgrading from ubuntu 11.10 to ubuntu 12.04 \nand \nupdating from ubuntu 12.04 beta to ubuntu 12.04?\ni have ubuntu 12.04 beta and ubuntu 11.10 installed.  \n\nA: I wouldn't say so. The beta MAY be able to be updated to the Final release by simply updating some packages, whereas 11.10 may need an official upgrade, by neither would really be more difficult than the other. I'd upgrade the version that has the programs you use the most.\n\nA: The difference is that upgrading from 11.10 will leave your previous settings intact, and it might lead to problems with settings that cannot be simply transferred from one version to the next, but these problems are usually minor.\nWhat can also happen in this case is that you get a lot of obsolete packages, and may sometimes have problems with the upgrade of certain packages, especially if you have installed 3rd part apps.\nUpdating from a beta to the final version usually will not lead to these problems and is much smoother.\n", "Q: Firefox upgrade breaks Ctrl-W and Ctrl-U keybindings The Ubuntu upgrade for Firefox to version 12.0+build1-0ubuntu0.11.04.1 broke the Ctrl+W and Ctrl+U keybindings in all my edit controls.\nOther people asking for \"Emacs editor controls\" have found Firemacs useful -- but Firemacs does not provide a kill-word or kill-line field to bind with.

My computer cannot read DVD's (it's that old) so I have the Windows 7 iso file on my desktop and a free 4gb USB that can be used to install it.  I would also like to be able to boot into this separate Windows partition.\n\nA: Use the \"GParted\" tool available from the Ubuntu Software Center (package name is just \"gparted\") to create a new NTFS partition for Windows to use.  Note that it may need to be a primary partition (as opposed to a logical, or extended partition).\nTo create the bootable USB drive with the Windows installer, you'll find how-to's in other places across the web.  Once you're in the installer, be sure to specify the partition you created using GParted rather than letting Windows take over the entire disk.\n\nA: If you haven't already made a partition, use gparted   to resize your first partition, and make another NTFS partition, this may need to be done on a live cd, http://sourceforge.net/projects/gparted/files/gparted-live-stable/\nThen use the Windows 7 USB/DVD download tool, https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/windows-usb-dvd-download-tool , http://wudt.codeplex.com/\nBasically you run the tool on windows and it transfers your iso(it does not provide this so no licensing issue...)(wine doesn't seem to work with it) to install the iso on your usb.\nThen boot your pc to the usb, del usually gets to bios options, F8 many times lets you select the boot device (check you BIOS/motherboard manfucture information for more details or for what keys to press) tell windows to install on you empty partition, be very careful to choose the right partition to install to. This will install windows but It will overwirite grub, so you need to re install Grub, via the Boot-Repair tool on a  Live cd https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Boot-Repair , https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Grub2#Reinstalling_GRUB2.\n", "Q: How can I personalize my MacBook Pro Touchpad? I'm running Ubuntu 12.04 LTS on a MacBook Pro 5.5. I'm just wondering if there is something that takes all the kinks out of the touch-pad. It works good, but it feels sluggish, double tap works about 75% of the time and sometimes while I it somehow selects something on a different page (although I'm not sure if that has to deal with the touch-pad and not weird laptop bugs for a new LTS)\nIf there are any programs, apps, commands aside from the built in system preferences > mouse and track-pad > touch-pad menu that allow someone to \"optimize\" touch-pad potential.\n\nA: Just use\nsudo apt-get install gsynaptics\ngpointing-device-settings\n\nGraphical interface to control your touchpad. Much easier.\n\nA: Great adjustement Chan-Ho Suh, you can do this changes to get \"Natual scrolling\":\nOption \"VertScrollDelta\" \"-85\" and Option \"HorizScrollDelta\" \"-85\"\n\n\nA: You can modify the relevant section of the file /etc/X11/xorg.conf.  If the file doesn't exist, create one.  An example file to show you the proper format is this:\nSection \"InputClass\"\n    Identifier         \"Touchpad\"\n    Driver             \"synaptics\"\n    MatchIsTouchpad    \"on\"\n    Option         \"ClickFinger3\" \"2\"\n    Option         \"HorizTwoFingerScroll\" \"1\"\n    Option         \"VertScrollDelta\" \"85\"\n    Option         \"HorizScrollDelta\" \"85\"\n    Option         \"TapButton1\" \"0\"\n    Option         \"TapButton2\" \"0\"\n    Option         \"TapButton3\" \"0\"\n    Option         \"FingerHigh\" \"8\"\n    Option         \"FingerLow\" \"8\"\nEndSection\n\nYou can delete, modify, or add option lines.  Here are some frequently used options. (The link refers to another file, but don't worry about that; the path I gave will do the same thing)\nSince it's cumbersome to restart each time to test your configuration, I recommend using synclient at the command line.  Here's another Arch wiki link that explains how to use synclient.  Besides using it to test values for options, you can also see what the default values are for the options you didn't set.\n\nA: I used the following:\nmake the /etc/X11/xorg.conf file as recommended above:\n# /etc/X11/xorg.conf\n\nSection \"InputClass\"\n    Identifier         \"Touchpad\"\n    Driver             \"synaptics\"\n    MatchIsTouchpad    \"on\"\n\nthen do this:\n$ sudo sh -c \"synclient -l | sed 's/    \\([a-Z0-9]*\\) *= \\([0-9.-]*\\)/\\tOption \\\"\\1\\\" \\\"\\2\\\"/' >> /etc/X11/xorg.conf\"\n\nthis should dump your current touchpad settings into the file and save you a lot of time, just adjust the values from what shows up as a result. Double check the resulting syntax or you may break your X server. This will also dump the \"Parameters..:\" something like that line that synclient outputs, you'll need to remove that. I'm not sure how to filter it at the command line level. and dont forget to add EndSection at the end.\nedited for better version of shell command.\n\nA: I found an excellent solution in the forums a couple of days ago specifically for macbooks, if it doesn't feel sensitive add this to your startup\nsynclient FingerLow=10; synclient FingerHigh=20\nPlace any name and add that as your command and that's it.\n", "Q: Is it possible to install drivers used on Windows for Ubuntu?

Not \"legacy\" or compatibility features for older processor architectures.\nUsing a 32 bit kernel will not help with any of your issues and I would say that its extremely uncommon to have problems because of using 64 bit kernels instead of 32 bit ones.\nYou are having backlight issues but I cant tell what hardware you are using.\nAccording to google, its Nvidia, if so try switching from the Nouveau driver to the Nvidia driver which can be done easily in the \"additional drivers\" program.\nIf this doesn't help try installing:\nmpb nvidia backlight driver\nfor your nvidia card.\n\nA: If you have more than 3gb ram , better go with 64-bit.

I recently upgraded from 10.04 to 12.04, and there is no show desktop in the launcher. I know I can use Ctrl+Super+D, but is there a way to get it in the launcher?\nEdit:\nI just installed the \"show desktop\" icon on the launcher with MyUnity (see below) and it worked fine.  It did not install the icon above Dash launcher, but well below it.  That bug has apparently been fixed.  This is as of 2012.9.30.\n\nA: 13.04 and later\nThe show-desktop icon is now a toggle option via System Settings - Appearance\n\n\nA: When you are using Unity you got animations activated and could then use an edge binding. Whit this you even don't have to click.\nYou can install CompizConfig Settings Manager from the Software Center go to 'General Settings' (1.) then to key bingings (2.) and there you can choose an edge to trigger 'Show Desktop' (3.). There you also have the option to set an individual keyboard shortcut.\n\n\nA: There is a \"Show desktop\" icon when alt-tabbing, so you can use alt-tab then shift-alt-tab to accomplish this.  \n\nA: Ubuntu 11.04\n\nFrom webup8.org: (With slight modifications by me)\n\n  \n*\n  \n*Install wmctrl.\n  \n*Download the script and .desktop file, extract it and place the \"showdesktop\" script in the /usr/local/bin folder using the commands below:\ncd ~\nwget http://webupd8.googlecode.com/files/showdesktop.tar.gz\ntar -xvf showdesktop.tar.gz && rm showdesktop.tar.gz\nsudo mv showdesktop /usr/local/bin/\n\nIf you want to manually download the file, get it from HERE.\n  \n*Now you should see a file called \"showdesktop.desktop\" in your home folder - you can move it wherever you want (or leave it there) and then simply drag it to the Unity launcher and you'll have a \"Show desktop\" icon.\nKnown issue: when clicking the \"Show Desktop\" icon in the Unity launcher, you'll have to wait until the icon stops pulsating before clicking it again (that's about 10 seconds) or else the it doesn't do anything. You can middle click when the icon is pulsating if you don't want to wait (thanks to Mahdi for the tip!).\n\n\nA: 12.04 and earlier\nYou could install MyUnity  and there you will have the option to active \"Show Desktop\".\nNote: As of May 2012, this places the Show Desktop icon above the Dash icon.

So you can not quickly do hide -> unhide. It actually works via the command line, so maybe there's a way to fix this, but I have no idea how.\nUpdate for 11.10:\nIn 11.10 the shortcut super+d doesn't seem to work anymore.

I restarted the computer and now it will not boot. I have seen various messages such as BOOTMGR missing, missing operating system, no bootable devices.\nI tried using boot repair but it did not help. \n\nA: Are you dual booting Windows and Linux? From what I see, Linux does not see a valid boot loader, and BOOTMGR sounds awfully Windows Vista/7 like. And I know for a fact that Linux uses no such file. It also looks like your partition table may be damaged. I wouldn't be surprised if having two bootloaders on your hard drive is part of the issue (You have one on the MBR, and on Partition 2).\nAt this point, I'd say your best bet would be to copy all of your files on your home partition (or home folder) onto an external hard drive or flash disk and reinstall Linux. If you use Windows, be sure to get it in a working state using startup repair, or the recovery console before installing Linux, otherwise you won't be able to boot into Ubuntu.

Right after that, I could boot again from the stick and repair the installation. \nMaybe that helps in your case too. \n\nA: I had a similar problem when I tried to make a live USB for 12.04 with the \"Unetbootin\" application.

For testing purposes I usually download the ubuntu kernel available from git and build it for my PC.

Shouldn't be a separated patch that can be downloaded and applied to the vanilla kernel so that it can be \"Ubuntu'fied\"  \n\nA: The Ubuntu kernel doesn't use Debian packaging to apply patches to the kernel source, the way most Debian packages do. In terms of Debian packaging, there's a whole new upstream tarball for each kernel release.\nThis is done because the Ubuntu kernel team uses git to maintain kernel changes. This aligns us with upstream kernel practices and is more transparent than Debian packaging, for other kernel developers who want to see the (git) patches that make up our kernel.\nYou can find the Ubuntu git repositories for the kernels here:\nhttp://kernel.ubuntu.com/git\nreleased kernels are found in ubuntu/ubuntu-.git\nInstructions for building a kernel are here:\nhttps://wiki.ubuntu.com/Kernel/BuildYourOwnKernel\nUse the section for cloning the git repo, and then examine the git logs to find the patches for the driver you want.

What will be the best suitable solution? I've heard of pptpd and openvpn, also know that windows could not connect to openvpn using its built in VPN client despite of its security benefits.\nMy another concern is in terms of speed, which package would transmit data faster(even a little faster)?\nThanks for kindly help.\n\nA: If the machines on the VPN are all running Windows and the purpose of the VPN is to facilitate Windows gaming, and you have a powerful computer running Windows that you use for gaming, then you might just want to use that as your VPN server. Regardless of what VPN solution you choose, there's no fundamental reason why the server must be separate from the machines using the VPN.\nWhether you host the VPN with Windows, Ubuntu, or some other OS, it seems from your question that you're most interested in knowing about the advantages of various VPN's from the perspective of Windows usability and performance. Therefore, you might get better answers if you were to ask a reformulated version of your question somewhere Windows is supported, such as Super User.\nSince you're using Windows, presumably you're willing to use proprietary software. (Many games have proprietary engines, too.) So you might consider using Hamachi (see also this article). It's proprietary but not payware unless you use some of the more advanced features. It provides VPN without the need for a VPN server. Hamachi supports Windows and Mac OS X and has a beta client for GNU/Linux (including Ubuntu). This may work well even if the VPN must be accessed robustly by Ubuntu (for example, if you run dedicated game servers on an Ubuntu machine). If the VPN need only be accessed casually by Ubuntu, then this will almost certainly work well.\n", "Q: Is it possible to modify the Wubi Installer for other distros? I'm interested in trying out other distros but I for various reasons, I'm not allowed to actually install them with all the partitioning and such. Ubuntu's Wubi installs various Ubuntu derivatives. There's an installer for Linux Mint call Mint4Win and it's very similar. I'm wondering if it's possible to modify the Wubi program to install other distros and how would I be able to do this? Even if it installs only derivatives, that's better than nothing. Thanks\n\nA: According to this link (https://wiki.ubuntu.com/WubiGuide#Can_I_use_Wubi_for_non-Ubuntu_based_distributions.3F) it is possible to modify Wubi for use with other distributions, this involves probably a lot of scripting/coding and recompiling of wubi, additionally some Linux files (in the distribution) may need patches and some packages are required.\n\nWubi can be easily rebranded and modified. (Wubi Guide: How do I compile Wubi from source?)\nNote that you need the following: A Live CD with ubiquity + casper + lupin-support (which provides lupin-casper). The ISO must have a .disk/info formatted like the one in the Ubuntu ISO and with data matching what you provided in the isolist.ini (ibid)\nNote that upstream files (Linux-side) need to be changed since normal distributions are generally not capable of targeting and booting (and rebooting) off of a loop device.\n(Can I use Wubi for non-Ubuntu based distributions?)\n\nThat said, it is possible to modify Wubi to make it boot other distributions (such as Linux Mint) but this requires modification on the image side of your distribution.\nYou could try and rename a live image of a distribution you would like to boot to ubuntu-12.04-desktop-amd64.iso (or ubuntu-12.04-desktop-i386.iso depending on your architecture), put it in a place wubi can find it (root of any drive but C:\\ or same folder as wubi) and then install \"ubuntu\" in wubi knowing that it is not really ubuntu.\nI would, however, strongly recommend not to do so because it could potentially screw up many things: Wubi may refuse to start the installation, or it will install and the installed distribuation will not work properly.\nIn summary: Yes, wubi may be modified for other distributions but the distributions have to be modified correctly in order to work with wubi. So you will have to ask the maintainer of the distro of your choice to support wubi.\n", "Q: Unable to connect to wireless internet on an Acer Iconia W500 with an Atheros AR9285 I'm using an Acer Iconia W500, and immediately after upgrading from 11.10 to 12.04, it is unable to access the internet.

This has been asked and answered previously. Please take a look at this question and its answers:\nHow do I set Windows to boot as the default in the boot loader?\nSetting GRUB_DEFAULT= to the numeric position in the GRUB menu of the OS you want to boot is a \"less special\" approach. This method can break if new entries are added to your GRUB menu. \nTwo other approaches you could use which might serve you better are:\n\n\n*\n\n*Set GRUB_DEFAULT= to the title of the menu entry you want as your default. That method is described in this answer to the question above.\n\n*Set GRUB_DEFAULT= so the default is to boot the operating system you booted the last time (also referred to as the \"saved method\"). This is discussed in this answer.\n\n\n\nPlease check the version of GRUB used on your computer\n\nAccording to this section of the Ubuntu GRUB documentation, you can check the current version installed on your system ... from the command line by opening a Terminal and entering the following: \n  grub-install -v\n\nGrub 2 should display a version number of 1.96 or later. Grub Legacy is version 0.97.\nPlease also take a look at the version information displayed on your GRUB boot menu. It's pretty easy to find, but I provided an image to illustrate anyway. :-)\n\n\n\nAnother thing you could do which would help is to install the Boot-Repair tool and use it to Create a Bootinfo summary.\nTo do this you would first install the tool using apt-get. The terminal commands to do this are\nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:yannubuntu/boot-repair\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get install -y boot-repair\n\n\n\n*\n\n*When this completes (successfully), enter the command boot-repair to start the tool. \n\n*After a slight delay, boot-repair will prompt you to download the newest version. Since you just downloaded & installed the tool there is no need for this so answer No.\n\n*If boot-repair requests to install the pastebinit package, respond with Yes.\n\n*The tool will now scan your system and (eventually) display the window shown in the image below. For now just click on the box/button to Create a Bootinfo summary. This will collect information about your system's boot configuration, but will not make any changes.\n\n\n\nWhen the bootinfo summary has been created, boot-repair will display a message containing a URL like this: http://paste.ubuntu.com/123456/. Please add this URL to your question. The information this link points to will allow us to better understand how GRUB is set up on your computer.\n\n\nA: I've had similar problems. \nAfter my last couple of distribution upgrades, my grub didn't see the new kernel and update-grub didn't help. I needed to run grub-mkconfig -o /boot/grub/grub.cfg to let grub know that a new kernel existed.\nI found out the reason after reading this article. I had grub2 installed on my disk, but only the grub package installed on the computer. Probably this is the reason why the dist-upgrade script (that probably uses update-grub) only updates the menu.lst and not grub.cfg.\nI've just installed grub2 and now update-grub generates the grub.cfg\n\nA: I hope a reinstall of the grub can resolve your issue. Try booting the OS by inserting the Ubuntu CD and try the following command.\nsudo grub-install /dev/XXX\n\n", "Q: Unable to save images by dragging and dropping them from browser to Nautilus or desktop In Chrome on Windows I usually save images by dragging them from the browser to the folder I want to save them to.

I've tried booting the ISO from a USB and a CD but when I chose the boot option it just goes straight through to my normal desktop. I upgraded to 32bit 12.04 with Update Manager with little fuss. Also, I tried to boot 64 bit version of 11.10 and was then just going to upgrade through Update Manager but it's the same thing.

Yeah fullahs, I had found it in a forum that I needed to do a fresh install to switch from 32bit to 64bit. I found the problem. It was as you as you suggested John. I was using Brasero to create the boot disk and just assumed that because it was installed as standard with Ubuntu, that there would be now problems using it. Of course, 8 useless DVD's yesterday (indicative of my level of cognitive reasoning) and about 9.3 seconds of research this morning has revealed that there are plenty of issues with Brasero.

It is not difficult to migrate the user database from vsftpd into proftpd. \nAt least is what I had to do in order to have my server up an running again (and asap)!\n\nA: This might work: sudo apt-get install libgcc1-dbg.\n\nA: I had the same problem, running vsftpd on Ubuntu 13.10, and none of the suggestions worked.\nAfter a lot of googleing, I stumbled upon the same issue in the Redhat Bugzilla\nTheir solution, which worked for me: recompile the vsftpd package after modifying the source file defs.h (the DEFINE VSFTP_AS_LIMIT has to be changed to the value \"400UL * 1024 * 1024\"). I don't claim to understand what that does, but now everything works perfectly for me.\nTo recompile the package, follow these steps (this is for Ubuntu 13.10, but should work similar for other releases):\n\n\n*\n\n*add source repositories to /etc/apt/sources.list by adding the line deb-src http://archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu saucy main universe restricted\n\n*Update the package lists: sudo apt-get update\n\n*Install some utilities needed for compiling stuff: sudo apt-get install fakeroot build-essential\n\n*Get everything that is needed for compiling vsftpd: sudo apt-get build-dep vsftpd\n\n*Get the vsftpd sources: apt-get source vsftpd (this works as a non-root user)\n\n*Change VSFTP_AS_LIMIT in the defs.h file to the value 400UL * 1024 * 1024\n\n*Commit the changes, or compile will fail: dpkg-source --commit. This will create a new patch file. You are then prompted to enter a name and info for that post.\n\n*Re-build vsftpd: fakeroot buildpackage. It should compile, and there should be a new .deb-file created.\n\n*Install this newly created package: dpkg --install vsftpd_3.0.2-1ubuntu2_amd64.deb (change the file name accordingly)\n\n\nThat's it, worked for me. It might be a good idea to put that package on hold so it will not be overwritten when a new official package is released by the Ubuntu team.\nUpdate: I just tried this on Ubuntu 12.04 LTS, worked as well.\n\nA: *\n\n*Install: libpam-ldap\nYou'll now get this error:\n500 OOPS: vsftpd: refusing to run with writable root inside chroot()\nBecause of this update in v2.3.4:\n\n  \n*\n  \n*Add stronger checks for the configuration error of running with a writeable root directory inside a chroot().

To fix this, I would try removing Edubuntu completely. However, you might need to make a backup of the files you want to keep and make a fresh install of Ubuntu 12.04 as there might still be some bugs and problems during the conversion.\nI wish you the best of luck in this and thank you for your patience and your valuable time.\nPlease feel free to post a reply if you ever have any more questions or for anything else in regards to this issue.\n", "Q: Why do I get disk I/O errors booting the 3.2 kernel on a xen vps server?

On the other hand, the Ubuntu 11.10 entry from the same partition suggests the presence of boot files there, which implies, the it has been a system (or a boot) partition before. I suspect that something like ls /home/ will reveal the old installation of 11.10 on /dev/sda9.\nHow that happened is not very clear. I can only guess that the / and /home partitions has been misidentified at the time of installation, the old / has been assigned to /home, and not formatted, whereas the old /home may have been assigned to /, and formatted. You might take a look at the old fstab on /dev/sda9, to gather more info.\n", "Q: Best video cards for 3 monitors? I am looking to purchase a new video card and I want to run three LCDs side-by-side.\nI normally would buy NVidia, but from what I have read, ATI is the leader in multi-monitor with their Eyefinity technology.\nMy Hardware\n\n\n*\n\n*My motherboard is a ASRock P67 EXTREME4 GEN3. \n\n*The Dell UltraSharp U2412M monitors I'm looking to buy have DVI, DisplayPort, but no HDMI.\n\n*My current video card is a GeForce 8800 GTS. It has 2 DVI ports. It would be nice to just add a second card, but I'm willing to replace it entirely.\n\n\nMy Software\n\n\n*\n\n*Currently running Ubuntu 11.10 amd64, but I will probably install 12.04 soon.\n\n*I'm running Gnome 3, but I'd be willing to switch to unity to make this work.\n\n\nRequirements\n\n\n*\n\n*I play games, so 3d acceleration must work. I may be okay with 3d acceleration only working on a single monitor.\n\n*The video card(s) must be able to push 1920x1200 across 3 screens.\n\n*I need a large, continuous desktop. I need to be able to drag windows between all three screens.\n\n\nWhat video card, or pair of cards, will support three monitors in Ubuntu?\n\n\n*\n\n*I'm willing to edit xorg.conf (and I've been around long enough to remember when you had to hand-edit it).\n\n*If I have to patch and/or compile some package, it's not a deal-breaker.\n\n\nA: *\n\n*To pull off that sort of trickery it really needs to be rendering on 1 video card, and then cutting that video apart and sending it to different monitors.  The game would be running similiar to 5760x780 with 1280x780 of that being sent to the 3 different video displays. \n\n*ATI Doesn't actually give any details about eyefinity.  So it's hard to say if it supports linux, or if it even supports openGL. \nSet up:\n( ask ubuntu wont let me post more than 2 links, look on amd for eyefinity then find set up link )\nFaq: \nhttp://www.amd.com/us/products/technologies/amd-eyefinity-technology/how-to/Pages/faqs.aspx\n\n\n*\n\n*I just read through their stuff (I'd kind of like this too)  linux isn't supported by eyefinity yet.  Windows XP isn't supported, just windows 7 \n\n*Check out Xinerama \nWiki about: ( can't post more than 2 links - wikipedia xinerama basically )\nUbuntu Xinerama page: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/XineramaHowTo\nI'd say give Xinerama a go, but apparently the performance is horrible.  Which is .. really not surprising, considering what has to be done to get an image that has been rendered to 1 surface, split into two and sent to different screens.  (The good news is that the performance penalty should be linear, and shouldn't scale with what you're doing, surfing the web or playing a game, the bad news is the penalty is probably pretty significant which means you loose a bunch of milliseconds off your render time which would mean you have to run the game in lower settings to get a good frame rate. )\nHopefully that helps your purchase decision, which should probably be: neither nvidia's surround system or ATI's eyefinity have linux support yet.  Both have win7 support, the eyefinity has win vista support.  So if you're dual booting - go for it.  Just make sure you get a card that's in ATI's faq supported hardware list with enough output ports for your needs.  Send ATI an email asking if you need the two cards or not, looking at their set up guide, seems so. \n", "Q: black line across top of display in virtualbox guest As you can see from the screen shot below, there is a display problem in my virtualbox guest running on an Ubuntu 12.04 64-bit host, using dual monitors.\nThe line does not appear on the monitor the mouse pointer is on, only the other one.\nI am running the latest Virtualbox (4.1.14) with GuestAdditions installed.\n\nAny suggestions for how to resolve this?\n\nA: It looks like it's the Panel's shadow.\nJust make sure your panel is not \"transparent\":\nLaunch the CompizConfig Settings Manager, go to the Ubuntu Unity Plugin, on the Experimental tab there are two Panel Opacity options you can tweak.\n", "Q: Distribution upgrade frozen at \"flashplugin-installer: downloading http...\" I have just started to upgrade from ubuntu 11.10 to 12.04, which I was at the library for...

After the browser prompts to install the Juniper VPN, I check it has been successfully installed to \"/home/huangyun/.juniper_networks/network_connect\". \nI open the Firefox from command line and check the log:\nLaunching \"/usr/lib/jvm/java-6-openjdk-amd64/jre/bin/java\" \"-classpath\" \"/home/huangyun/.juniper_networks/network_connect/NC.jar\" \"NC\" \"-h\" \"extranet.scei.a-star.edu.sg\" \"-L\" \"0\" \"-l\" \"0\" \"-n\" \"\" \"-t\" \"\" \"-x\"\n\nI run the above command manully:\n$ java -classpath ~/.juniper_networks/network_connect/NC.jar NC -h extranet.scei.a-star.edu.sg -L 0 -l 0 -n \"\" -t \"\" -x\nFailed to load the ncui library.\nQuitting.\n\nI check the file libncui.so and found that the .so file is 32-bit version:\n$ file libncui.so \nlibncui.so: ELF 32-bit LSB shared object, Intel 80386, version 1 (SYSV), dynamically linked, stripped\n\nI can not recompile the 32-bit .so file to 64-bit, so I think I have to install 32bit Java on 64bit Ubuntu 12.04. Could you please tell me how to do it? I have searched the web but find little information.\n\nA: Juniper used to require Oracle Java, due to a bug in OpenJDK.  \nRefer : https://github.com/flexiondotorg/oab-java6\nto install java.\n\nA: To answer the original question:\nOn 12.04 and 12.10, it is possible to install i386 packages on amd64 by appending \":i386\" to the package name when running apt-get. So, for example, while running an amd64 Ubuntu 12.04 Live CD, I ran:\nsudo apt-get remove firefox openjdk-6-jdk icedtea-6-plugin\nsudo apt-get install firefox:i386 openjdk-6-jdk:i386 icedtea-6-plugin:i386\n\nAnd could then successfully log into the VPN.\nSince 12.04, Juniper VPN will work on OpenJDK 6 out-of-the-box but only on i386. There was a bug in the icedtea plugin that was preventing this from working previously. I have verified that this is fixed using an i386 Ubuntu 12.04 Live CD.\nI am surprised that the amd64 Oracle JDK is working for you. However, I have not yet tested it myself, but when I do I will update this answer. It would be good if you can confirm exactly what packages you are now running.\nIt is worth noting that there is an optional part to the Juniper VPN login process called the Host Checker that may or may not be configured on the VPN server you are connecting to; it enforces security policies on Windows computers but still has to run on Linux to check what OS you are using. This could result in differing reports of success from different people. For reference, the VPN I use does have the Host Checker enabled.\nIn your original question you state that you were installing Java 7 packages, yet your log shows you are using Java 6 in Firefox. If you have multiple JDKs installed, you need to be clear which on you are using.\nFor reference, there is also a very long-running thread on the Ubuntu forums on Juniper VPN.\nUpdate\nI have now tested the amd64 Oracle JDK and it wouldn't work for me. So as far as I can see, installing the i386 version of the Oracle JDK or Open JDK is the only way to get it working.\n\nA: Using the instructions here: http://www.rz.uni-karlsruhe.de/~iwr91/juniper/\nI have juniper VPN running on Ubuntu 12.04 64bit with no 32 bit software installed except for these 3 libraries:\nsudo apt-get install libc6-i386 lib32z1 lib32nss-mdns\n\nI start the jnc perl script use the --nox option (no gui) and it works great, I use it everyday. \nI originally downloaded the cert file using Firefox 64-bit: \nTools>PageInfo>Security>View Certificate>details>export\nI have since found this script that does the same:\nhttps://github.com/udomsak/juniper-ncui/blob/master/getx509certificate.sh\nMy particular configuration file required host, user, realm, and certfile.

I would guess there are none, unless you have set up one yourself.\n\n*You can set up your apache server to listen to IPv6 addresses like you set it up to listen for IPv4 addresses. I would not use a link-local address, which always starts with fe8 or fe80::/10. A link-local address is/should never be routed, and you must always specify which interface you should route through with a link local address.\n\n*Yes, you need to configure Apache2. You could use the localhost address, which is ::1/128, or a global address, which are ones from the net 2000::/3 starting with a 2. To enter a IPv6 address in a web browser, write it like this http://[::1] or in your case http://[fe80::7a2b:cbff:feb0:a047].  \n\n*As there are very few ISP's that support native IPv6, I guess you will need to set up a tunnel between your net and a tunnel provider for IPv6. I use http://he.net/ as such a tunnel broker, but there are others. You can use any ordinary computer for this, but there are some home routers which have support for IPv6 tunneling, like D-Link. But you have to check for yourself. I use a Linksys with http://openwrt.org/ firmware myself.  You will see if you have routing if you use the command ip -6 router. Both your IPv6 address and router settings of your computer should be set automatically if you have a working IPv6 router in your net.\n\n\nSo set up your apache2 to listen to IPv6 localhost.\nOR\nFirst set up an tunnel to get IPv6 to one of your local machines.  There are many ways of doing this. Check with your tunnel broker. When you can surf from your machine, continue.\nAfter that you should set up the machine to be a router of IPv6 for your LAN and announce the net prefix that you got for your LAN to other clients.  On linux you can use radvd for this.\nOr install gogoc, register a user and change /etc/gogoc/gogoc.conf so your machine is a router for your LAN. It will set up all things, like sysctl and radvd for you, except for the firewall.\nYou should also set up a firewall for your IPv6 LAN, and I would recommend ufw.  Which world great after enabling IPv6 in /etc/default/ufw. It should be on nowdays.  There are different iptables commands for IPv4 and IPv6 firewalls.\nThen set up your apache2 to use a global IPv6 address.\n", "Q: How to setup ATI Mobility Radeon HD 4650?

I just want to retrieve important data from this machine's hard drive and get a working computer again ASAP.\nWhat should I do?\n\nA: Don't panic!\nThe chances are great that your personal data is fine. Please try the steps below. If anything doesn't work or seem right, you can bail with no risk of data loss.\n\n\n*\n\n*Obtain an Ubuntu installation medium. (LiveCD or LiveUSB)\n\n*Turn off your system, insert the installation medium, and boot it, selecting \"Try Ubuntu\" when the option comes up.\n\n\n*Click \"Home Folder\" in the Unity launcher.

The Windows logo kept spinning as usual, then it stopped.  Next my computer restarted itself and said that there is a \"problem\" with Windows so I have to run the Windows recovery partition to repair.  Then it goes through a 1-hour long process and restarted again.  I chose Windows from the GRUB menu and Windows booted.\nThe question is:  What is the anonymous problem that happened to Windows?

(until 2013-04 according to: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ubuntu_%28operating_system%29#Releases)\n\nA: Ksplice allows you to apply patches to a running kernel without rebooting the system.\nIt freezes your kernel execution momentarily and points the routines that are modified to the new \"patched\" routines.  Once this has been re-pointed, it resumes your kernel execution.\nMost /minor/ updates would probably be patched in this method but any significant changes would still require a reboot.  Since most security patches are considered minor adjustments, this would work.  Major updates would require a reboot regardless.\n", "Q: Tips for getting videos to run smoother on my poor old laptop? I reinstalled xubuntu on my good ol' laptop from 2005, and everything works great! The only problem is that video is slow/choppy - on the order of 4-10 frames a second, depending on the video. I used to stay up late in bed watching shows like Arrested Development and The Wire on this laptop, so not having video is a huge bummer.\nI've tried lowering my resolution, and using different media players, like vlc and mplayer. That seems to help a little, but not enough to make videos watchable.\nAnother thing I noticed is the proprietary video drivers aren't available anymore - if there is any way to install these things again, that might work. I'm willing to get my hands dirty, but I'm not sure where to get started with something like that. Back in the ubuntu 8.04 days, the proprietary drivers loaded themselves automatically, but now they don't work at all.\nThe other thing I could try is re-encoding my videos somehow. That's something I don't know where to start with, so if anyone has any advice, I'd love to hear it. I did manage to install handbrake, but the options are kind of overwhelming, and I'm not sure where to start.\nTL;DR I could use help either a) installing old, unsupported proprietary drivers or b) somehow re-encoding videos to be easier on my processor maybe?\n\nA: Pop into Menu -> Settings -> Settings Manager -> Window Manager Tweaks, click on Compositor and turn Compositing OFF...\nThis may help playback a little, failing that you could recode the movies to a simple .avi by using a program called Transmageddon which is very simple to use and in the repo's...\nBTW, which graphic card does your laptop use ?\n\nA: Before doing all that, have you tried switching to unity 2d?

For some reason the file contained information of the network I was VPN'ing into. I simply removed the file and everything worked for me.\n\nA: This has to do with the switch to resolvconf for /etc/resolv.conf management, as described here.\nI solved the problem by inserting dns-nameserver and dns-search options into /etc/network/interfaces. I obtained the values required from /etc/resolvconf/resolv.conf.d/original.\nI don't know if this is the \"best\" or \"proper\" solution, but it resolved (!) the issue for me. I also don't know why this was necessary.\n\nA: May not work for everyone, but I solved this in 12.04 by going to \"Edit Connections\"(right click on your internet connection logo) and unticking the \"Require IPv4 for this connection to complete\" box. Instant result!\n\nA: Same problem here.  I do not use Network Manager, so that may have had something to do with the problems during the upgrade.  In looking at the article referenced above (http://www.stgraber.org/2012/02/24/dns-in-ubuntu-12-04/), it describes several files that could be present in /etc/resolvconf/resolv.conf.d .  The file called \"tail\", which gets processed last by resolvconf, was not present, but \"original\" was.  I simply copied the contents of \"original\" (containing my working DNS config) to the \"tail\" file, which I had created.

When I first boot my computer without a DVD inserted, /dev/dvd exists and points to the correct place (/dev/sr0).  However, when I insert a DVD, /dev/dvd disappears.  I'd like it to stick around so I don't have to navigate to /dev/sr0 in programs that are looking for DVDs.  How do I ensure that the /dev/dvd symlink exists and points to the right place?\nIt looks like I can add something to /etc/udev/rules.d/70-persistent-cd.rules.  This site gives a couple of examples, but the 70-persistent-cd.rules file says \"add the ENV{GENERATED}=1 flag to your own rules\", which isn't part of the examples.  The man 7 udev page is impenetrable to me, and I'm not convinced the linked page gives 100% of the information I need.\nSo, what can I do on a modern, Ubuntu 12.04 (or later) system to make /dev/dvd always exist and point to the right device?\nEDIT: Is it as simple as adding ENV{GENERATED}=1 to the rules in the linked page, something like this:\nSUBSYSTEM==\"block\", KERNEL==\"sr0\", SYMLINK+=\"dvd\", GROUP=\"cdrom\", ENV{GENERATED}=1\n\nIs that the right information for modern Ubuntu?  What is ENV{GENERATED} doing there, when it wasn't generated, but hand-written?\n\nA: This tutorial explain very nice how to do what you want:\n\n\n*\n\n*Creating Custom Symlinks to Devices\nAccording to it, there are two approaches to creating symlinks. The first one is to use the model name and the serial number:\nSUBSYSTEM==\"block\", ENV{ID_MODEL}==\"...\", ENV{ID_SERIAL}==\"...\", ENV{GENERATED}=\"1\", SYMLINK+=\"dvd\"\n\nThis way, the symlink will stay correct even if you move the drive to different positions on the IDE bus, but the /dev/dvd symlink won't be created if you replace the drive.\nThe second one is based on the location of the device on the bus:\nSUBSYSTEM==\"block\", ENV{ID_TYPE}==\"...\", ENV{ID_PATH}==\"pci-...\", ENV{GENERATED}=\"1\", SYMLINK+=\"dvd\"\n\nThis way, the symlink will stay correct even if you replace drives with different models, but place them to the same positions on the IDE bus. The ENV{ID_TYPE} key makes sure that the symlink disappears if you put something other than a DVD in that position on the bus.\nYou can find the values for ID_MODEL, ID_SERIAL, ID_TYPE and ID_PATH using the following command (the udevtest command as in tutorial doesn't work - anymore ? - in Ubuntu):\nudevadm info --query=all --name=sr0\n\nThe SUBSYSTEM==\"block\" key is needed in order to avoid matching SCSI generic devices. Without it, in the case with SCSI DVD, the symlink will sometimes point to the correct /dev/sr0 devices, and sometimes to /dev/sg0, which is wrong.\nThe ENV{GENERATED}=\"1\" key is needed to prevent the udev 75-cd-aliases-generator.rules file from overriding your custom rules.\n\nA: I found this on a fedora forum may helps:\nCreate a shell script file \nIn that file, put:\n#!/bin/bash\nln -s /dev/sr0 /dev/dvd\n\nMake sure the file is execlutable:\nsudo chmod +x /etc/rc.d/rc.local\n\nIf you're going to use the rc.local route, you also need to do this, as root:\nsystemctl enable rc-local.service\n\nbecause it's not enabled by default\nsource:http://forums.fedoraforum.org/showthread.php?t=295048\n---------The preferred way these days would be a UDev rule--------------\nBased on /lib/udev/rules.d/60-cdrom_id.rules, which creates the /dev/cdrom symbolic link, try adding a file /etc/udev/rules.d/60-dvd.rules containing:\nKERNEL==\"sr0\", SYMLINK+=\"dvd\", OPTIONS+=\"link_priority=-100\"\n\n", "Q: Skype video not working after upgrade from 11.10 to 12.04 I used Skype with this command on Ubuntu 11.10:\nLD_PRELOAD=/usr/lib32/libv4l/v4l1compat.so skype\nBut since I upgraded to 12.04 it dosn't work and I can't use my video (Webcam).\nI have latest libv4l and my Webcam works with other apps.\nHow can I fix this?\n\nA: First you will need to make sure you have libv4l-0 installed. \nIf you have installed Ubuntu restricted extras then you should already have it if not open Software Centre and install Ubuntu restricted extras from there.\nOnce this is done open a Terminal and copy and paste the following command\nsudo gedit /usr/share/applications/skype.desktop\n\nAfter you have provided your password a text editor will open.\nLine 4 should look like this\nExec=skype\n\nReplace with this text\nExec=bash -c 'LD_PRELOAD=/usr/lib/i386-linux-gnu/libv4l/v4l1compat.so skype'\n\nSave and exit the text editor and close the terminal.

No need to other software or driver.\n\nA: *\n\n*connect MTS in a Windows 7 system for the first time, and a CD drive will be mounted.\n\n*Don't install the software, open the MTS CD Drive, find a file with .deb extension\n\n*It is the debian driver file which we need to install\n\n*Copy/Paste the debian file into Ubuntu Home, open terminal and run the following command\nsudo dpkg -i packagename.deb\n\nmention the package name correctly.\n\n*Easiest way would be double clicking the deb file, which opens UBUNTU software installer, but many times it returns an error\n\n*Don't bother about the modem disconnected error. I too get it quite often. Sometimes it takes 10-20 minutes after many trials. Connect the device first and then start the system. Don't know the technical reason behind this. But I get connected in 2 or 3 attempts by doing this.\n\nA: The following worked for me: \n\n\n*\n\n*Click on the network connection icon in the upper right corner of the desktop.  \n\n*Then go to Edit connections->Add->Connection Type-> and selected Mobile Broadband->Select Service Provider, configure and Save.  \n\n*The trick comes after.

After upgrading to 12.04, my system became terribly slow. Applications are running very slowly and become very unresponsive. I am not able to do anything. Before upgrading, it was running very good, even better than Windows.\nI also often get errors when I try to run an application\nWhat should I do? I want to make my Ubuntu work faster again. Please help me.\n\nA: I had a problem with an upgrade a few years ago that made my laptop unusably slow. I eventually found the problem was a malfunctioning CPU frequency governor, which meant my system never got off its lowest CPU frequency. The problem went away when I made the system use the conservative governor by default instead of the ondemand one. For more on frequency scaling, see for example: https://idebian.wordpress.com/2008/06/22/cpu-frequency-scaling-in-linux/\n\nA: My recommendation is, if you can, back up all your files to an external drive, download the 12.04 CD, and do a clean install. Then you can restore your files from the external drive.\nAnother possible solution, if you don't mind going under the hood, would be to install a second hard drive in your computer and do a clean install of 12.04 on that.\n\nA: I had the same problem. Fixed it with resetting unity (unity --reset) and logging in on 'gnome without graphical stuff'. That worked for me. So it probably has something to do with old settings and new unity. Not sure though :), hope it helps to get your system running again. \n", "Q: windows border disappeared in ubuntu 12.04 the window borders disappeared mostly when I start a game or an application and then close it. it seems to be a compiz issue and when I restart compiz it will work again but I also get the following warning:    compiz (decor) - Warn: failed to bind pixmap to texture\nany way to solve this its really annoying???\n\nA: I have the same problem. It's indeed a Compiz bug. I don't have the real solution (will probably come with an update of Compiz) but the easiest workaround is to launch again the compiz window decorator.\nJuste type ALT+F2 and enter :\n/usr/bin/compiz-decorator\n\n", "Q: Why do I get \"init: failed to create pty...\" errors on boot? I've installed Ubuntu 12.04 yesterday with a LiveUSB.\nI had problems at booting, so I had to repair grub, and it was ok.\nBut now when I start up my pc, I get the error message\n'init: failed to create pty - disabling logging for job'\nAnd nothing happens. How to fix that?\n\nA: This is currently a known bug in upstart (Ubuntu's startup manager or init-replacement).\nIt should not be happening to normal users running the regular Ubuntu kernel on a desktop/laptop, but apparently it does for some of them.\nThe fix is to add a --no-log boot option to your kernel command line. You can do this by editing /etc/default/grub:\n\n\n*\n\n*Alt+F2, then gksudo gedit /etc/default/grub\n\n*Look for the line starting with GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT=\n\n*The line normally says this:\nGRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT=\"quiet splash\"\n\n*Add --no-log to that line, i.e.:\nGRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT=\"quiet splash --no-log\"\n\n*Save and exit. Reboot and the errors/warnings should be gone.\n\nTechnical Explanation\nAccording to comments in the bug report, upstart expects /dev/pts to be mounted and the /dev/ptmx device to exist when it starts, and prints these errors when it can't find the devices. These are set up by the initramfs on Ubuntu, so in theory these errors should only occur on embedded devices, etc. that have no initramfs. They should not be fatal because eventually in the startup process, mountall will ensure that /dev/pts and /dev/ptmx are set up correctly.\n", "Q: Where can I find the 64bit Minimal CD? Where can I find the Minimal install 64bit version? Is it possible to encrypt partition with the Minimal Minimal version (like with the alternative version)?\n\nA: The link to the minimal for 12.04 64bit is:\nmini.iso\nOther versions can be found from here:\nMinimal CD\nNot sure if it is possible to encrypt with the minimal.\n", "Q: Keyboard shortcut for \"Lock screen\" not working I tried the combination CTRL+ALT+L or L but it is not working. But if I select the menu item Lock screen from the Setting drop down it works.\nAny thoughts on how to fix keyboard shortcut?\n\nA: This is also an issue in 20.04 when using lightdm.\nFor the default lock screen shortcut to work switch to gdm3.\nFor lightdm you need to add a custom shortcut with the command dm-tool lock.\n\nA: In the top panel right corner choose System Settings to select Keyboard in the   Hardware section, or type \"key..\" in the Dash then select Keyboard:\n\nIn the Shortcuts tab all key combinations are listed. You may change them there or add your own custom shortcut. To have the poweroff shortcut back add it with a custom shortcut for the following command:\ngnome-session-quit --power-off\n\nNote: to be able to add a custom shortcut we may have to clear an already existing shortcut if this uses the same keys.\nThe GNOME lock screen feature depends on the gnome-screensaver . In case you have removed it or did not install it in a custom environment you will have to install it first.\n\nA: For my debian based crunchbag Distro the Window_Logo_Key+L is the shortcut for locking the screen but you of course change it as mentioned above\n\nA: I was experiencing this symptom, but none of the above solutions were working. I found out that this was because I had previously disabled the screen lock because I did not want the screen to lock when the screensaver starts.\nThe takeaway is that screen lock will not work unless it is enabled in your gnome settings. You can ensure it is enabled with the following command: \n# Note the disable flag is set to false, so its really enabling the behavior\ngsettings set org.gnome.desktop.lockdown disable-lock-screen 'false'\n\nAfter running this, the Super+L hotkey worked fine. \n\nA: This seems to have been improved in 12.10. \nIf you go into System Settings > Keyboard > Shortcuts, System, \nthen left-click once on 'Lock screen', \nthe Ctrl+Alt+L on the right changes to 'New accelerator...[something]', at which point you can hold Super [Windows key] and press L. \nThe keyboard shortcut will then show as 'Super+L' and works immediately.\n\nA: I also suffered when turning off the screen, could only turn off the computer. But for myself, I found a solution: Ctrl + Alt + F1 a terminal without a graphical shell will appear and immediately a Ctrl + Alt + F8 will be prompted to log in. Good luck.\n\nA: Sorry for abusing old threads but I looked too for this issue and want to share my experiences without opening a new thread for this, to avoid more waste data. Today I figured out that both lock screen (like mentioned above) and monitor standby was disabled. And gnome-screensaver was removed. But I didn't disabled both of them nor removed gnome-screensaver. What the heck is going on here?! What did disable them?\nAh btw. I'm use Ubuntu 20.04 and Nvidia display driver.\nEdit: I know now what it is. It's the Phoronix Benchmark Test. It disables the lock screen and display standby.\n\nA: In Kubuntu version 18.04 / Plasma, this appears to be found under \"Screen Locking\".  From the start menu, type \"Screen...\" and you'll see the applet allowing you to change this setting. \n\nA: For Xubuntu (18.04) the command is flock4. \nIt can be associated with shortcut via:\nMenu / Keyboard / Application Shortcuts\n\n\nA: None of the answers here worked for me.\nInstead, based on this, I installed gnome-screensaver and set Super+L to the following command: gnome-screensaver-command -l. Works like a charm.\n", "Q: Dual boot with ubuntu and windows (ubuntu 12.04LTS) \nPossible Duplicate:\nCannot dual-boot Windows 7 and Ubuntu? \n\nMy set up is 1 PC 2 Disks disk1 ext4 ubuntu disk2 NTFS windows 7 and am wanting to dual boot with grub 2.  \nWith grub I used to be able to set-up a menu item like this\ntitle Windows 7 \nmap (hd0) (hd1) \nmap (hd1) (hd0) \nrootnoverify (hd0,0) \nchainloader +1 \n\nMy install method was I installed win7 on disk 1 some time ago and to install ubuntu I cleared my 2nd drive and then disconnected drive 1 completely plugged drive 2 in as drive 1 and installed linux.\nThe logic behind the above grub entry was to keep both OS intact i.e. disconnect either drive and the remaining drives OS would/could boot because the windows boot loader remains in tack on disk 2 and grub takes care of disk 1.\nI understand I can add the above to the 40_custom in /etc/grub.d/ but am not sure if update-grub will still go of and attempt anything I do not intend\nAny help or assistance would be appreciated as it stands I can boot both O/S via boot device selection form BIOS but in the old days with a gentoo install I was able to do so with grub.\n\nA: To setup a dual boot Grub2 needs to \"see\" Windows while installing. This of course was not possible after you unplugged the drive.\nPlug the drive in and run\nsudo update-grub\n\nin a terminal should fix this.\n", "Q: How to take screenshot of indicator menus? If I hover over to the setting menu or any of the indicator menus, Prnt Scrnbutton won't work.\nIf I want to take the snapshot of these menus, how do I do that?\n\nA: Try the Screenshot application included with 12.04\nOpen the Dash and type screenshot\n\nWith this application you can set a delay, by adjusting the value in the \"Grab after a delay of\" box, before it will automatically take a screenshot allowing you to open the menu you want a picture of.\n\n\nA: Shutter-Indicator\nA less mechanical method to print a pop-up menu.

This ensures that you have all necessary dependencies before installation begins.\nIf your internet connection is interrupted, you will need to restart the update command (if updating using apt-get in the terminal) and it will try fetching the file you were fetching when connection is interrupted.

It has an NVIDIA GT540M with Optimus. Conveniently, there's no way to disable Optimus in the BIOS. lspci output:\n\n00:02.0 VGA compatible controller: Intel Corporation 2nd Generation Core Processor Family Integrated Graphics Controller (rev 09)\n01:00.0 VGA compatible controller: NVIDIA Corporation GF108 [GeForce GT 540M] (rev a1)\n\nI have bumblebee installed and it seems to work fine. I've been using glxgears from mesa-utils to test it. I'm not sure if this is normal, but running \"glxgears\" by itself gives:\n\nError: couldn't get an RGB, Double-buffered visual\n\nBut \"optirun glxgears\" works fine, getting framerates around 5800-6000 in 5 seconds.\nMy only issue is that the hardware-accelerated desktop effects aren't working. I can't enable wobbly windows or any animations. Worst of all, the Aero-like window-maximizing effect doesn't work. I haven't been able to get that effect enabled at all, even though it worked when I ran off the USB drive. I'm only assuming it's linked to my video card issues, but if there's a way to enable it please let me know!\nIs it that optirun uses the NVIDIA drivers, but the intel drivers aren't setup properly? Did I miss a step?\n\nHere's one more screenshot. It's also worth noting this is a 64 bit install of Ubuntu!\n\n\nA: If you use nvidia-current-updates, you have to edit /etc/bumblebee/bumblebee.conf and set KernelDriver=nvidia-current-updates under [driver-nvidia].\nIt sounds that you've just installed Bumblebee, but that you've selected the universe repository during installation. That pulled in the nvidia driver which broke your 3D acceleration and other OpenGL capabilities. Try restarting the X server, e.g. by rebooting the machine.\nIn case the issue still persists, it is possible that some libraries have been installed in a wrong location. After installation of Bumblebee, /usr/lib/xorg/modules/extensions/ should not contain libglx.so, libglx.so.VERSION or nvidia_drv.so. If that is the case, remove those files (it requires root privileges):\nsudo rm -f /usr/lib/xorg/modules/extensions/libglx.so* /usr/lib/xorg/modules/extensions/nvidia_drv.so\n\nYou may also have to reinstall the nvidia-current package if Bumblebee does not work afterwards:\nsudo apt-get install --reinstall nvidia-current\n\nRe-login and your problem should be solved.\n\nA: i faced the same problem....\ni fixed it by reinstalling compiz-core package..\nalso please use \"bumblebee tumbleweed 3.0\".. its way better than ironhide.\n"]
