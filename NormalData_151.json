["Q: Installing Linux without affecting Window 7 I have Window 7 installed on my laptop and I can install Linux (Ubuntu). I just wanted to install it with the following conditions:\n\n\n*\n\n*At the time of booting I get option for both OS, but if I delete Linux OS it should not affect the booting process of Windows. May be it automatically gain Windows bootloader or if its Grub, its OK.\n\n*I am not aware of what is \"sda\" at the time of installation. Can I create \"sdb\" without destroying Windows partitions and install Linux in this \"sdb\"? I got free space in my system.\n\nA: Answer to question1:  if you delete Linux and want to not affect the windows bootloader then the Windows bootloader would have to manage both OSs.\nQuestion2: sda, sdb, sdc ... you see a pattern? Everyone is a separate partition, and this is their name. In windows you have C, D, E ...\nTo make what you are asking I would do like this:\nEnter in Linux and do 4 partitions:\n\n\n*\n\n*sda formatted as ext4\n\n*sdb formatted as linux-swap (with the space double of your ram in the system)\n\n*sdc formatted as ntfs\n\n*sdd formatted as ntfs\n\n\nFirst instal Ubuntu, when you install you select the mout point / in the sda and then the sdb as swap partition and you install.\nThen, install Windows 7 and you will see you have 4 partition in which 2 as ntfs and and probably two unrecognised. In Windows you will have the C drive where the Windows is and the second where you put your data.\nSince the Windows 7 is installed secondly and because Windows does what it wants, it will put its bootloader over the Linux one.\nNow I have not done lately this (2-3 years ago), and I may not be the best practice, but you get the point.\n\nA: Use gparted to change partiton sizes or choose install alongside option [EASY] to install ubuntu.\nIn case you install Windows 7 after Ubuntu and Ubuntu partitions are NOT deleted,\ndownload and burn this ISO file to a CD Super Grub Disk\nBooting from CD this menu will appear.\n\nSelect 5th option to get old grub menu and boot Ubuntu.\nOpen terminal and type \nsudo grub-install /dev/sda\n\nor\nsudo grub-install /dev/sdb\n\nYou should get \"operation completed without errors\".\nthen\nsudo update-grub\n\nfinally\nsudo reboot\n\nYou will get your Ubuntu back.\nI hope this makes things safe for you and installing Ubuntu without fear.\nOk in case you delete ubuntu parttions then follow this Getting windows 7 after deleting ubuntu.\n", "Q: How to change tor to run by a different user?

Hence, the Unity version in those PPAs are older than the ones in the official repositories. Consequently, your system updated Unity using the packages provided in the official repositories. \nYou could either wait for the one of the PPAs to be updated (and your system will automatically use it) or you can use Synaptics to force your system to use one of the PPAs. The latter method is not recommended, as it could break something and you would also loose these bug fixes from your system. \nIf you absolutely want to downgrade the packages, open Synaptics, select the unity-2d package. Then, select \"force version\" from the Package menu or hit Ctrl+E and follow the instructions on the screen.

As an example, this\n x={{-b +- sqrt{b^2 -4ac}} over {2a}}\n\nwill turn into this\n\nHere's the a screenshot: (Notice the first symbol on the tool bar - that's where I've place the Insert Equation button.)\n\n\nA: Use the Dmaths add-on, which enables you to type the equation directly into the text  \ne.g. : You would like to type an integral from a to b of f(x) dx, you just type \" a;b;f(x) \" ( without quotes ) and you type the short-cut \"ctrl+shift+i\" and there it is.  \nI'm a math teacher and this is how I type all the equations I need.  \nThere's another add-on that acts the same way called Cmath, but the first one is the most complete because you can also draw simple 3d figures, do plane geometry, and different other stuff.\n\nA: Formula bar will be grayed out and unclickable, until you install LibreOffice Math. It will \"unlock\" your formula bar. The Math icon cannot be found/placed on desktop or all application menu. It is used as extension to use formula bar. That's because the LibreOffice Math software is very useless - can only type some formulas,but not text and things from \"insert\" menu. But as I said, it \"unlocks\" formula bar from LibreOffice Write, Presentation, Calc and Draw.\nSo go to Ubuntu/Unity/Gnome Software (it depends on your operating system) and type \"LibreOffice\" . Than select \"LibreOffice Math\" from the suggested search bar. Then install it.\nYour formula bar is now useable and clickable!\nAfter you click it, you will see a some kind of LibreOffice Math, but inside LibreOffice Write, Calc, Presentation or Draw. By using operations in your right you make your own equation. The operators will make little boxes where you write letters and numbers.\n\nA: Alt+I, O, F comes handy\nThere after a formula editor panel will be displayed.\nOnce you finished press\nEsc\nit will close the formula editor\n\nA: Install the TexMaths extension (Tools > Extension Manager).  You will need to click on Get more extensions online... search for TexMaths in the online repository download and install (usually double-clicking the file will open LibreOffice for installation). Restart LibreOffice and the TexMaths should appear in the toolbar.\nLatex installation is also required:\nsudo apt install texlive texlive-binaries dvipng\n\nPlease note that when you are using the TexMaths extension, you should always use the .odt format to save your files. Microsoft office does not support .svg images.\nAlso configure TexMaths to use scalable vector graphics (.svg) with this format your equations will always print crisp/sharp no matter how big or small you make them on the page. Do not use .png as the print quality will never be as good as .svg.\n", "Q: Required space for dual boot Will a 128 gig solid state drive\nbe big enough to comfortably run\na dual boot of ubuntu and windows 7?\n\nA: The Ubuntu installation requires between 3-4 GB hard drive space, and 8-10 GB will be needed to run comfortably. But you may need at least 25-30 GB day to day.\nWindows 7 on the other hand needs 16GB of available hard disk space (32-bit) or 20GB (64-bit), but that's just for windows itself.\nKeep in mind that Ubuntu once installed, will have an office suite, utilities, and a lot of other applications, where with windows you need to install all these apps, which will require additional hard drive space.  Just to give you n example, Microsoft office pro fully installed requires 3.5-5GB.\nSources:Ubuntu & Microsoft\n\nA: Yes, that's more than enough for both systems. Obviously, it depends on what other data you plan to have in these systems. But remember that Ubuntu can access Windows' file system, but Windows cannot access Ubuntu's. So if you're going to have other data on this SSD, such as video and music, you might want to allocate most space to Windows and then use that as storage for those things. \n", "Q: Can I make the MAAS server Juju machine 0? On a MAAS cluster, if I do a \"juju bootstrap\", it creates a bootstrapping node from one of the free machines in the MAAS cluster, which becomes machine 0.\nIs it possible for me to make the MAAS server itself the bootstrapping node?\n\nA: I'm going to assume you mean the maas-master, the provisioner, in which case no; not at this time. In order to deploy something with MAAS and Juju the machine needs to be enlisted within MAAS otherwise Juju has no idea where it is or how to talk to it. If you were to enlist the maas-master then when you did \"bootstrap\" it Juju and MAAS would end up wiping and re-provisioning it. In doing so you would lose the maas-master.\nContainerization and other co-location features are landing soon (including new provider types) which will allow you to pack more density in to a single machine. So in theory, you can soon run a bootstrap then deploy services on to the bootstrap, shrinking the number of physical machines needed in a deployment.\n", "Q: Why can't I install the fglrx drivers for a RV620 card?

Is there a way to set a custom keyboard shortcut to get the same result? Hopefully a single command that I could insert among my other Custom keyboard shortcuts in System Settings > Keyboard.\nThank you very much, have a good day.\nP.S.: the matter continues here: \nHow to set a single shortcut to switch an Internet connection on and off\n.\n\nA: Please read the whole thing before modifying anything. Ask away if you have doubts with some step.\nApproach 1: Using nmcli\nOpen Keyboard and add a custom shortcut. For the command type nmcli nm enable true, that will activate the Network Manager (if your network is set to Automatic it should connect immediately). If you want a shortcut for disconnecting, the command would be nmcli nm enable false.\nFor more information about nmcli and other ways to accomplish what you want, read man nmcli.\nApproach 2: Using /etc/network/interfaces\nIf you'd rather activating/configuring your internet connection manually, you can skip Network Manager and configure the file /etc/network/interfaces to your needs.\n\nFirst disconnect from the internet and disable Network Manager:\nsudo stop network-manager\necho \"manual\" | sudo tee /etc/init/network-manager.override\n\n\nOpen /etc/network/interfaces in an editor:\nsudo gedit /etc/network/interfaces\n\nand add the following:\n# The wireless network interface \niface wlan0 inet dhcp\n  wpa-ssid  wireless_network_name\n  wpa-psk   wireless_passphrase\n\n(I am assuming you are dealing with a wireless connection, please do clarify if I'm wrong. I'm also assuming you only have one wireless card.)\n\nNow to make sure it is not so easy to see your passphrase:\nsudo chmod 600 /etc/network/interfaces\n\n\nModify your sudoers file so you can run ifup and ifdown without password\nsudo visudo\n\ntype i, go to the last line (with the arrow keys) and type\nyour_username  ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD: /sbin/ifup wlan0, /sbin/ifdown wlan0\n\ntype Esc and then type :wq.\n\nNow test it by running sudo ifup wlan0. Try opening a web page on the browser.\nIf that worked, now all you need to do is create a shortcut, so open Keyboard and add a custom shortcut. For the command type sudo ifup wlan0.\nYou might also want to create a shortcut to disconnect. For that the command would be sudo ifdown wlan0.\n\nIf you want to reactivate Network Manager, you must first delete/comment the lines you added to /etc/network/interfaces. Then run:\nsudo rm /etc/init/network-manager.override\nsudo start network-manager\n\n\nRemark:\nIf you are up to it, you can install gksu and for the shortcut command use gksudo ifup wlan0. This way you can skip the editing of the sudoers file (which I wouldn't recommend if you are in unfamiliar territory). With this method you would have to type your password, though.\nReferences\n\n\n*\n\n*Arstechnica: Howto deal with Network Manager completely from the command line\n\n*Ubuntu Help: NetworkManager\n", "Q: How to bring up a network interface only if it is physically present Running Ubuntu Server 12.04 (no GUI).

Note that this settings is greyed out until you provided the necessary details.\nAnd of course also enter the other details about security, SSID, etc.\n\n\nA: I've come up with the following solution which doesn't depend on any extra packages:\nauto wlan9\niface wlan9 inet manual\n        wpa-ssid MYSSD\n        wpa-psk MYKEY\n        wpa-proto RSN\n        wpa-pairwise CCMP\n        wpa-group CCMP\n        wireless-power off\n        pre-up if [ -f /sys/class/net/wlan9/operstate ]; then ifconfig wlan9 up; fi\n        up if [ -f /sys/class/net/wlan9/operstate ]; then dhclient wlan9; fi\n\nWhile it may not be elegant, it does what I want: skips wlan9 initialization without boot delay if the wireless dongle is not plugged in, otherwise brings it up. \n", "Q: Server not found with auto ethernet Almost very often I get server not found issues while surfing with auto ethernet connection.

I am trying to create a bootable image of USB drive.\nStartup Disk Creator is able to recognize the USB correctly and automatically. When I choose the ISO by clicking on Other..., it doesn't throw any error, but the file does not appear in the Startup Disk Creator window.\nThe ISO is 705 MB in size and I am on 12.10. I tried creating an empty ISO file and it is not being recognized.\nCan you please help me in this regard ? Thanks in advance. \n\nA: Try doing it another way. First, determine what device node your USB stick is (usually /dev/sdb unless you have another storage device plugged in or multiple hard drives).\n(To verify, you can open the Disks application that comes with Ubuntu, find your disk and click it, then look right under it for the device node.)\nAll you have to do now is open a terminal with Ctrl+Alt+T and run\nsudo  dd  if=/path/to/ubuntu.iso  of=/dev/sdX  bs=8M\n\nwhere /path/to/ubuntu.iso is the actual path to the Ubuntu ISO and /dev/sdX is your USB stick device node. That never failed me.\n\nA: Cloning tools\nThe cloning method described in the answer by ovc is very reliable, when used correctly, and it works with all hybrid iso files. Most iso files of modern linux distros are iso files.\ndd is a cloning tool. It is very powerful but also dangerous, because it does what you tell it to do without questions. So if you tell it to wipe the family pictures ... and it a small typing error away. It has earned the nickname 'data destroyer'.\nInstead you can use tools, that perform the same task under the hood, but help you select the target device and double-check that it is the correct drive. Starting with Ubuntu 16.04 LTS, the Ubuntu Startup Disk Creator, alias usb-creator-gtk, uses the cloning method. Disks alias gnome-disks can also clone from an iso file to a target device, usually a USB pendrive or memory card. These two tools are built into Ubuntu.\nThere are also other cloning tools, that can be installed into Ubuntu or Windows. mkusb can clone iso files and compressed image files. It can also create persistent live drives, and it can restore a USB boot drive to a standard storage device after the installation.\nWin32 Disk Imager is a cloning tool for Windows, that can help you create a USB boot drive with Ubuntu.\nExtracting tools\nThere are also many tools, that can create USB boot drives by extracting the content of the iso file to another file system and install a bootloader to the target device. Several of these tools work well and can be recommended, for example Rufus and Unetbootin.\nBut when the boot structure of the iso file changes (in a new version of Ubuntu), these extracting tools will have problems, until they are modified to recognize and manage the new boot structure. Older versions of the Ubuntu Startup Disk Creator (before 16.04 LTS) are affected by several bugs because of modifications of the syslinux boot structure in BIOS mode.\n", "Q: Prevent a user from accessing the internet, except for certain websites I'm trying to prevent a specific user from receiving traffic from any sites except specific sites on a whitelist.

I've read that if you've had problems with a CD, disc, install that some have gone to a network boot option and had to upgrade their BIOS if their older desktop doesn't match. Am I thinking correctly?\n\nA: Before you begin, you want to make sure that all of the data from your Windows installation is safely backed up, or moved to your Ubuntu partition. Also read these instructions briefly to ensure that they make sense.\n\n\n*\n\n*Boot from the Ubuntu live CD.\n\n*Open the GParted program. Your hard disk is split up into 'partitions'. You will have three (3) partitions: One for Windows, one for Ubuntu, and one (the smallest) swap partition.\n\n*Once GParted opens, identify the Windows partition. The partition type is NTFS and will be outlined in greenish blue. The Swap area will be red and the Ubuntu partition will be navy blue, but you want to keep these.\n\n*Right click the greenish blue Windows partition and click \"Delete partition\".\n\n*Now, right click the navy blue ext4 Ubuntu partition and click \"Resize/Move Partition\". A dialog box will open - drag the right or left edges of the navy blue box so it fills up the maximum amount of space possible.\n\n*Click OK to close that dialog box.\n\n*Click \"Apply\" in the main GParted window to apply these operations. Confirm that you want to, if you are 100% sure that you do not need Windows any more. The operation will begin, and it might take a long time - but be patient while it finishes.\n\n*One finished, reboot into your Ubuntu installation.\n\n*Open the Terminal with ctrl+alt+T and type sudo update-grub, then Enter. Type in your password, which will not appear, and press Enter again. This will remove Windows from the Grub menu.\n\n\nThen, you are finished.\nBut seriously, make sure you don't need anything (internet history, etc.) from your Windows installation! I find Firefox Sync, Microsoft Skydrive, and Google Drive very handy for ensuring a smooth migration to a new OS.\n\nA: *\n\n*Start from a Live CD\n\n*Open the GParted progam\n\n*Select the Windows partition (the one with NTFS as \"Filesystem\"),\nand delete it.\n\n*Then extend Ubuntu's partition (probably the largest one) by\ndragging it's edge to fill the whole drive and click the checkmark.\n\n*Wait for the operation to finish.\n\n*After rebooting, start the terminal and type:\nsudo update-grub\n\n\nA: you can just delete the partition where window is using your favourite partition manager.\nDon't forget to backup your files.\nAfter deleting the partition run sudo update-grub2 in a terminal, and type your password.\nNow you can use the free space to place a new partition for your files or whatever you like.\n\nA: Good thing you are going to Ubuntu. Microsoft End of Life for Windows XP is going to be on April 8, 2014. I already started Migrating all of my XP machines to Ubuntu. If I were you I would create a COMPLETE hard drive image of your computer with Clonezilla before installing Ubuntu. My reasoning for this is that in the event that you need to recover your Windows XP installation exactly to where it is at this very point in time, you can easily recover it without having to finagle with re-installing Windows XP or wait around for all of the Windows XP updates and Service Packs. However, if you are going to totally wipe your Windows XP installation just backup your files and erase Windows. \n", "Q: How can I install a .deb file from command line?

I state I am asking if it is possible and HOW. I note many forum answers are 'you can't' or 'you don't need to on Linux cause it is perfect and wonderful' - none of these answers will help.\nFirstly, the HDD in question is SATA 163 GB and contains ONLY backup data like music, video and NO windows programs or installations. I have had a HDD failure in second HDD that is completely FUBAR so have lost my windows installation, this HDD had linux and windows dual boot, HDD is undetectable in BIOS.\nThe working HDD is 130GB full with capacity of 163GB (it is badly fragmented due to excessive use...). I intend to defrag this drive using USB linux OS (bootable USB with installation files and 'trial') and any other programs that will enable this task. Once this is done I intend to locate which data areas are free (the end of HDD data storage area), create a new partition on this free space, install linux full version and get things working.\n+++\nI understand fully the following:\nI can buy a new HDD for install.\nI can get an external hard drive, back up the data.\nI also understand that copying off backup hdd and then copying back will do the same as defrag.\nI ask this question to find out how to complete this action I have requested and NOT to complete it using the methods unavailable to me at this time.\nThanks\n\nA: Personally I wouldn't bother to defrag the NTFS partition of the HDD since if you install Ubuntu on the spare part it will only use that amount as a hard drive and the rest will not be affected. Then just mount the NTFS on Ubuntu and access the files there. \nAn ext4 file system doesn't have the problems with empty slots as NTFS or FAT32. The problems with NTFS and FAT32 are that the storage is based on data being put in slots and if a files on fills up 15 slots but are assigned 16 slots then one slot will be empty. \nHere is where defrag comes in and moves the data around so that the data is used in each slot and the empty slots are declared as empty instead of used by this and that file. This saves space and makes access times shorter since you don't have to search the whole HDD for a file. \nIn ext4 files are divided throughout the disk and the fields where the data is stored is linked to the original file, so a file can be stored in row 1 field 2, row 3 field 12, etc.\nSo moving files around to save space doesn't work in ext4, you will make no more room on the hard drive. it will be just as easy to access files as it was before. This is just an example of the principle, explaining it in detail seemed too complex right now.  \nIs it possible to defrag an NTFS from Ubuntu\nWhat I've found out by searching on this topic is that there is no program to defrag an NTFS HDD from Ubuntu. The best solution is to:\n\n\n*\n\n*Mount the HDD under Ubuntu\n\n*Copy the files to another HDD\n\n*Re-format the HDD (preferably with ext4)\n\n*Move back the files\n\n\nIf you don't have another drive I would \n\n\n*\n\n*Create a ext4 partition on the empty space and move some files to\nthere\n\n*Remove those files from the NTFS partition\n\n*Resize the NTFS partition to make it smaller\n\n*Make the ext4 partition larger\n\n\nDo this procedure until all files are moved and the NTFS partition is gone. \n", "Q: How to change the graphics card driver via terminal? I recently tried changing the driver for my Asus Radeon HD 7870 to the proprietary one (a friend told me it was much faster), however that seems to have killed my install of Ubuntu. Now whenever I boot up it shows me GRUB, I select Ubuntu, and then it boots up for a second or two and then blackscreens. I think the blackscreen is caused by it reaching the login screen, as it is also at that point that I can SSH into it. \nSo can anyone tell me how to switch back to the open source driver? \nEdit: And I'll add, when I boot Ubuntu off of a USB, everything works fine. \nEdit: Ok here my process is for the driver. \n\n\n*\n\n*Install Radeon HD 7870 in my system\n\n*Boot up, everything is working fine automatically\n\n*I go and check and it is using the open source driver (I checked by going into the Software and Updates program and going to the driver tab)\n\n*A friend recommends I switch to the propietary one as it is faster (I believe it was something along the lines of flgrx-updates)\n\n*I go into the Software and Updates program, and navigate to the drivers tab. From there I selected the flgrx-updates one and hit ok. \n\n*I reboot my system, and then it won't work. After some basic troubleshooting, I come here. \n\n\nUpdate: Thanks to gertvdijk I have managed to disable the propietary driver, but Ubuntu still will not beat up. I'm guessing that for whatever reason the open source driver has not been automatically enabled. Anyone have any ideas? Are there any system logs I can give you guys to help find the problem? \n\nA: For 14.04 and upwards, jockey-text isn't installed or available in the repository. I have just recovered from an issue where the Noveau driver caused my computer to lockup completely after logging in and I needed to go back to the nvidia driver. Here's how I did it:\nAt the login screen, instead of logging in I went to a terminal using CRL + ALT + F2\nType\n\nubuntu-drivers devices  \n\nto get a list of your devices and identify the one you want.

I selected a different video card driver in the system settings, and after rebooting, my computer prompted me to start in low-graphics mode.\nWhat fixed the problem for me was deleting /etc/X11/xorg.conf. Now, X11 is the window manager used by Ubuntu, and it loads all files ending in .conf for its settings (at least - that's what 3 minutes of Google told me).\nSince I would be hesitant to outright remove files that may in retrospect prove essential, I renamed it to something else:\nsudo mv /etc/X11/xorg.conf /etc/X11/xorg.conf.backup\nsudo reboot\n\nThis fixed the problem for me.\nInitially, my idea was to use the command line to change the video card driver back. I resorted to trying this idea because I couldn't find a way to change the video card driver. One suggested answer said to use jockey-text (How to change proprietary video driver using the command line?); however, starting with 14.04 jockey-text isn't part of Ubuntu anymore.\nSome additional research: I read that X11 doesn't create an xorg.conf by default anymore. Above solution might not work for you.\n\nA: After no one giving any additional answers for 2 days, I decided to try to reinstall Ubuntu. I created a Ubuntu live USB, and using that told it to reinstall Ubuntu (replaces system files, but keeps my files), and that worked perfectly. \n\nA: Run over SSH:\njockey-text --list\n\nthen identify the driver you want to disable and run\nsudo jockey-text --disable driveridentification\n\nReplace driveridentification with the ID your driver shows up with (e.g. xorg:nvidia_experimental_310 in my case). I am unable to test/verify this at the moment.\njockey-text is the command-line text-only version of the \"additional drivers\" application in the regular GUI. You should be able to perform the same tasks as in the regular GUI application - see the help on other tasks: \njockey-text --help\n\nThis will work in your case as you say that you can still log in using SSH. For other readers who haven't set up SSH on their machine, they'll need to boot into recovery mode or to blacklist the graphics driver kernel module on the Grub command line and then perfoming the jockey changes.\n", "Q: Can I replace windows HD for new HD, install Ubuntu and then switch back to old Windows HD?

Previously I had been using VLC fluidSynth to export my midis to other formats, until recently when I discovered that it was ever-so-slightly out of tune and TiMidity actually played my songs without clipping. That was a major plus.\nHowever, there was one thing that fluidSynth did absolutely awesomely, and that was play percussion. Every time it played cymbals they must have lasted at least one and a half seconds, and they sounded great.\nBut when I play the same midi in TiMidity with the same soundfont, it always cuts off the cymbals, playing them for maybe half a second. I even tried assigning all the drums to a different soundfont but they still got cut off.\nIs there any way I can get TiMidity to stop doing this? I know I could export the drums from VLC and the melody from TiMidity and put them together in Audacity, but that's kind of a pain, especially when TiMidity should seemingly be able to play cymbals right itself.\n\nA: Timidity++ comes with some questionable default settings that essentially ignore the effects specified by the soundfont and midi source in favour of global defaults.\nThough I have no insight into why the developers have chosen to do that, I can speculate that it is because it's a lot easier to find awful midi files made by people who don't understand midi or music very well, or cobbled together soundfonts or patchsets that make perfect midi sound like a high-school band practising for the first time.\nTry the following settings in your timidity.cfg, they tell timidity to respect\nthe wishes of the creators of the soundfont and midi source.\n# Enable all midi effects\nopt -Ewpvsetoz\n\n# Don't cut sustain to save CPU \nopt --no-fast-decay\n\n# Pan quickly, even if it sounds bad\nopt --fast-panning\n\n# Set chorus and reverb by song & soundfont\nopt EFreverb=1\nopt EFchorus=1\n\n# Never kill voices to save CPU\nopt -k0\n\n# Sustain fades after three seconds (3000ms)\nopt -m3000\n\nYou may feel timidity sounds worse with these settings, if that's the case it probably means you're using a crappy soundfont. The FluidR3 soundfonts are okay for most midi files if you just want to get up and running quickly, however I recommend the Tyroland soundfont, it has well matched and balanced instruments with proper settings for reverb and chorus and sounds great with fluidsynth and timidity.\nhttps://musical-artifacts.com/artifacts/1305\nIf it still sounds bad, try finding better midi files or playing better.\n", "Q: CD/DVD burner does not recognize any DVDs Just upgraded to Ubuntu 13.04 and it no longer recognizes DVDs, either commercial or recordable DVD+R.

You can either install these on a 64 bit system, or go for installing libstdc++6:i386 and libncurses5:i386. I'm interested to learn what the difference is between the two types of packages.\nWhat is the actual difference? Why are they both available?\nBeing under the impression that libx:i386 is the new way of doing things, is this method always preferred over installing the lib32x variant?\nHaving a couple of lib32x and a couple of libx:i386 libraries already installed also makes me wonder if it would be a good idea to switch to only one type of package by replacing them with there counterparts.\n\nA: The practical difference between these packages is where the libraries are located. With libfoo:i386, libraries end up in multiarch paths such as /usr/lib/i386-linux-gnu whereas with lib32foo:amd64 libraries end up in the \"old\" paths such as /usr/lib32. In a distant future we would get rid of any lib32foo packages, but we are not there yet. At least lib32stdc++6 is needed for building gcc-X.Y at the moment, because it builds gcc-X.Y-multilib which is capable of supporting switches such as -m32 to select the target architecture (i.e. the architecture of the resulting binary). Without the lib32foo packages, the build-dependencies of gcc-X.Y would cross architecture boundaries and this is not yet supported. There are a few more issues that require keeping the lib32foo packages for a while.\n", "Q: Is there an easier or more 'correct' way to open gedit as root?

So is there?\nEdit:  I just 'improved' my script by replacing sudo with gksudo.  Now I don't have to have a terminal window open while gedit is open.   So I guess this is quite convenient for now :)   It would be good, for the sake of knowledge, to know if this is anything close to how the more seasoned ubuntu users would do this type of thing.\n\nA: I find myself running gedit as root quite frequently, so I added the option to the right-click menu in Unity (it uses the same command as the selected answer, gksu gedit).\nYou will need to edit a *.desktop file in order to add the menu option, and you have two choices:\n\n\n*\n\n*/usr/share/applications/gedit.desktop (requires root access to edit) - The menu option will be added for all users. Note that you may need to re-edit this file, adding the option if an update to gedit occurrs that overwrites your changes.\n\n*~/.local/share/applications/gedit.desktop (If you can't find it there, make a duplicate of the one found in /usr/share/applications/, and save it to this new location) - The menu option will only be available for the specified user, and is considered \"better practice\". Note that if you already have it docked to your Unity bar, you will need to choose Unlock from Launcher on your existing GEdit icon, then re-add your \"custom\" version. These changes should stay even if GEdit gets an update.\n\n\nEdit the text file gedit.desktop, adding the following block of code (you can use the existing two blocks as a template):\n[Desktop Action RootWindow]\nName=Open a Root Window\nExec=gksu gedit\nOnlyShowIn=Unity;\n\nNext, add the new action to the list (should be at around line 19 of the text file):\nActions=Window;Document;RootWindow;\n\nNow right-clicking the text editor window in Unity brings up this handy new option:\n\n\nA: Use admin:// in front of the file name which brings up the standard GUI password prompt for your respective WM/shell. \nSo for example, if you wanted to edit your repos, instead of typing sudo gedit /etc/apt/sources.list you would type gedit admin:///etc/apt/sources.list. It works for basically all GUI programs, not just Gedit.\n\nA: gksudo gedit works in 16.04 LTS, but in in 17.10 with Wayland gksudo does not work.\n\n\n*\n\n*You can install and use gksudoif you select Xorg at the log in screen,\n\n*but in Wayland you should use\n\n\n*\n\n*a text mode editor, the simple nano or the advanced emacs, which is what the developers of Wayland want (for security reasons)\n\n*or you can use xhost and sudo -H gedit according to the following link,\nWhy don't gksu/gksudo or launching a graphical application with sudo work with Wayland?\n\nA: Use gksudo gedit. \ngksudo is the equivalent of sudo for graphical programs, which are not safe to run using sudo.\n\nA: You can open Nautilus as root, gksu nautilus, now any text file you open from that window will open in Gedit as root.\n\nA: gksudo is apparently not available on newer Ubuntu versions and gksu wasn't working for me, but this answer was very helpful in my case (Ubuntu 17.04).\nUse visudo to add the following line to your sudo config file:\nDefaults env_keep=\"XAUTHORIZATION XAUTHORITY TZ PS2 PS1 PATH LS_COLORS KRB5CCNAME HOSTNAME HOME DISPLAY COLORS\"`\n\n\nA: EDITOR=gedit sudo -e is recommended.\n", "Q: Video downloaders need I am using Ubuntu 13.04.

The Ubuntu site downloads 12.04.2,\nWhen I open my VM it asks if i want to install along side. That wasn’t what i expected, it feels like i have a miss matching VM and OS.\nIs that likely?\n\nA: In short, 12.04 is a LTS release, 12.04.2 is the 2nd maintenance release or service pack. \nAs long as you run apt-get update && apt-get dist-upgrade -y in the VM and wait for it to finish.

Other than verifying that the Windows install completed successfully, I have done absolutely nothing else to the computer. I now want to install Ubuntu 13.04 on the same machine in a dual-boot setup. However, the Ubuntu installer starts out by giving me the message\n\nThis computer currently has no detected operating systems.\n\nfollowed by the single option\n\nErase disk and install Ubuntu\n\nI expected it to say that it detected an existing Windows 7 installation and ask me if I wanted to get rid of it or keep it as a dual-boot.\nI've checked out a few existing AU questions on this topic (Ubuntu 13.04 not detecting Windows 7 during Install; \"This computer currently has no detected operating systems\" when installing; Ubuntu 12.10 install don't recognize Windows 7; Ubuntu 12.04 installer does not see Windows already installed on my computer) and they all seem to lead to the same two conclusions:\n\n\n*\n\n*use fixparts\n\n*use gparted\nWhen I tried to use fixparts, the system told me it was the wrong tool, with the output\n$ sudo fixparts /dev/sda\n\nFixParts 0.8.7\n\nLoading MBR data from /dev/sda\n\nThis disk appears to be a GPT disk. Use GNU Parted or GPT fdisk on it! Exiting!\n\nI think gparted is a non-option for me because I want to dual-boot and — to the best of my understanding — it would wipe out the Win7 install. However, I did open it up just for inspection purposes. Here's a screenshot of everything I did:\n\nFor what it's worth, the hard drive itself doesn't seem to be corrupted; I can open it up in Ubuntu and see all the Windows files and directories there that I expect. (It's the middle right window in the screenshot.)\nWhat else can I do here to get Ubuntu to install side-by-side with Windows?\n\nA: Ha!!\nThanks a lot for this answer!\nWhen I wanted to install Ubuntu 13.04 alongside Windows 7, I had the same problem - Ubuntu's installation wouldn't recognize that Win 7 was installed, so it never offered the possibility to install Ubuntu alongside Windows.\nTrying to troubleshoot, GParted recognized the HD as 1 non-allocated space.\nThis is even though Ubuntu 12.10 was installed (but corrupted because of an update, which was the reason for upgrading to 13.04 in the first place...)\nBottom lines:\n\n\n*\n\n*By using Window 7's diskmgmt.msc I recreated free space where Ubuntu 12.10 was originally installed.\n\n*I ran the 13.04 installation - and boom! Ubuntu recognizes Windows - I see the option to \"Install Ubuntu alongside Windows 7\".\nFYI, Ubuntu installation overtook all the un-allocated disk space automatically, and also allocated SWAP space.\n\n*When rebooting I faced another problem - instead of Ubuntu 13.04, I was still seeing Ubuntu 12.10...\nThis was clearly a grub problem.\n\n*To solve this problem, I used the default instructions for BootRepair:\nFound here: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Boot-Repair\n5. Hallelujah !!   ;)\n\nA: I worked around this by taking a detour into Windows and playing with partitioning. After rebooting into Win7, I opened up the Windows Disk Management utility (diskmgmt.msc). The system was still set up to use basically the entire disk as one giant Windows partition (AKA the C: drive). I used Disk Management to chop off a 120GB segment, left it as \"unallocated space\" and rebooted.\n(Actually, I then went back and reformatted it as NTFS, but in retrospect, I believe that that was unnecessary.)\nAt that point, I reopened the Ubuntu installer. The installer still didn't recognize the existing Windows install, but it did offer a \"Something else\" option (screenshot at debianadmin.com) of making custom adjustments to partitions. I selected that option and found the 120GB partition I created in Windows, and selected it as the partition in which to install Ubuntu.\nThe installer then gave me the error\n\nNo root file system defined.\nPlease correct this from the partitioning menu.\n\nSome quick searching for that error message led me to an AU answer with a helpful screenshot that I won't repeat here.\nAfter that, I got yelled at by the system for trying to use NTFS — a no-no, according to Ubuntu's Linux Filesystems Explained wiki — and for not setting any swap space — again, see Ubuntu's excellent wiki — but after I switched to Ext4 and carved a 5GB swap area out of the 120GB partition, installation proceeded without a hitch.\n\nA: Ok, here's my 2 cents, as I ran into the same issue on my Windows7 64bit installation, when trying to install Ubuntu 14.04 alongside: it didn't recognize my windows OS...\nThis was happening when using the Live CD of Ubuntu 14.04... I also had a bootable USB drive with this iso, so thought 'what the heck, let's just try...', booted from the USB stick, and installed Ubuntu without any issues whatsoever, it recognized the Windows 7 installation and installed perfectly next to it.\nSo, basic answer: after being unsuccessful when using the live CD, try installing from a bootable USB drive. The USB ports get initialized in a different way than the CD drive, so possibly that's the reason behind it working from USB, and not from CD...\nEnjoy Ubuntu:)\n\nA: Also, if your windows is using UEFI make sure to boot the usb drive with your ubuntu on it under UEFI. My BIOS offered me both options when selecting the usb as booting device. Only when choosing UEFI, it would then also recognize my pre-installed windows. \nYou can read more here \nUnrelated, but maybe also helpfull: the next problem I ran into was 'grub-efi-amd64-signed failed to install' which was easily solved by connecting to the internet during the install. \n", "Q: how do I install a network manager on Ubuntu?

And now run again sudo apt-get install network-manager and that's it. \nI am hoping all dependencies are already there. So by this way you can install network manager without using any boot device\n\nA: I did not realize the OP could not connect to the internet. You don't need a network manager to connect to the internet. Don't waste your time looking for a different computer and transferring the files. If you have an Ethernet cable connect the computer directly to the modem and then:\nsudo nano /etc/network/interfaces\n\nAppend the following lines to the end of the file:\nallow-hotplug eth0\niface eth0 inet dhcp\n\nCtrl+X to exit and Y to save. Then:\nsudo ifdown eth0\nsudo ifup eth0\n\nYou should get an internet connection. If you do not have a DHCP server use the following instead (if you don't know if you have a DHCP server, then you probably have one so nevermind the following):\niface eth0 inet static\naddress 192.168.1.5\nnetmask 255.255.255.0\ngateway 192.168.1.254\n\nReplacing the address, netmask and gateway values with the ones you are used to.\nIf you cannot possibly connect the computer directly to the modem, you can also manually connect to a wireless AP, though it's much more complicated.\nAfter connecting to the internet:\nsudo apt-get install network-manager\n\nor wicd instead of network-manager - it's the one I use.\nIf you are not on the sudoers list issue su to become root and then do all the commands without sudo.\n\nA: To install NetworkManager that is installed by default when you installed Ubuntu,  just press Ctrl+Alt+T on your keyboard to open Terminal.

I want to know how safe it is to clone a disk that is being used at the moment it is being cloned.\nWhat problems could I have the cloned copy?\nWhat problems could I have with the original disk?\nWhat alternatives can I use (if available) to clone a working (in use) disk?\n\nA: As it is safe to bitwise clone an unmounted hard drive using dd we should not do so from a mounted drive which is in use. This is especially true for the mounted system drive.\n\nIt is not recommended to clone the system drive of a running system because we inevitably will have data inconsistencies from cloning files where the system will currently write to.\n\nNevertheless it is possibly to almost clone a running system after we had excluded our used system files from being copied. \nIt is at least the content of system directories below we should exclude from our backup copy. The content of these directories will be created on boot time but note that the directories will not be created, therefore we have to copy these, but exclude their content Source:Arch Wiki:\n/dev/*,/proc/*,/sys/*,/tmp/*,/run/*,/mnt/*,/media/*,/lost+found\n\nWe may also want exclude the trash, or other directories from /home/ to speed up the backup process.\nSuch an exclusion can nicely be done with rsync  resulting in a command similar to this:\nsudo rsync -avxAX /* /backup/directory --exclude={/dev/*,/proc/*,/sys/*,/tmp/*,/run/*,/mnt/*,/media/*,/lost+found}\n\nThis command should further be adapted to meet our personal needs (see [manpage for the rsync command]. Note that we may want to omit the option -x in case we also want to copy a source on multiple filesystems. We then should also exclude .gvfs to avoid copying GFVS mounted contents there.\nOf course the master boot sector, partition boot sectors, partition tables, and format of the source drive will not be copied by this. We will have to partition the backup drive before we are able to \"clone\" the source with rsync. We may also have to install Grub to this drive in case we want to also be able to boot from this drive.\nStill many files from the source system may not be really needed in the cloned system (think of old packages, kernels, etc.). Therefore rather than cloning a system we may be better off performing a backup of our source to restore it somewhere else.\n\n\n*\n\n*How to backup settings and list of installed packages\n\nA: From what I understand, you are trying to clone a hard drive that is currently in use.\nI wouldn't recommend cloning whilst it's still in use. The software might refuse to perform the task (e.g. GParted won't move/resize with mounted/in use partions/hard drives). It might be possible since all you are doing is copying the what's on the hard drive (as opposed to moving the data to another hard drive). How are you going to clone it?\nIs the software you are using to clone it on the same hard drive or a separate one. If it's separate, then try to unmount the hard drive before cloning. I'd normally suggest booting into a live CD or live USB of a linux OS or partitioning program (e.g. Ubuntu, GParted), but you say that you can't turn off the computer.\nThe way I see it, cloning is similar to copying files, and (since copying files with the disk in use is safe) it would appear to be safe to clone it. I'm not entirely sure, but that's all I can offer at the moment.\nI don't see any problems with the process, but I'm not experienced with 'cloning' and I'm not entirely sure of how safe it is.\n\nA: There would be a difference if you do as user :\n\ndd if=/dev/sdb of=/dev/sda\n\nor if you do :\n\nsudo dd if=/dev/sdb of=/dev/sda\n\nresp log in as su and then do :\n\ndd if=/dev/sdb of=/dev/sda\n\nThis would have effect to the permission attributes of some files.\n", "Q: How can I update Tor browser?

So do:\nexec ncat -l 7 -k -e /bin/cat\n\nThe reason I say this is that the documentation says:\n\nAny special characters, e.g. quotes or `$' specified  will  result in the entire command being passed to a shell for expansion.\n\nIn this case there's no need to call the command via the shell, so let's make it simpler so that you don't use the shell.\nIf you do want to use the shell, then you might explicitly use a script...end script stanza and explicitly use a shell exec command in there instead.\nI'm not sure why you're getting your original behaviour, but I think you may be able to fix it by avoiding use of a shell in the first place.\n", "Q: What does \"Open a console/terminal\" mean? I want to install a file and the instructions say \"Open a console/terminal\", then \"and cd to the location where the installer was downloaded\". What does this mean in plain English? It seems one has to be a computer geek to do the simplest thing in Linux!\n\nA: Open the terminal by searching for it in the Dash, or use the keyboard shortcut Ctrl + Alt + T.\nIn the terminal use the command cd to change the present working directory to a new directory (directory is used as a synonym for folder). For example, to change directory to your Desktop type the command:\ncd ~/Desktop  \n\nfollowed by pressing Enter. So if you downloaded the file to your Downloads folder, you would use the command:\ncd ~/Downloads  \n\nto change the present working directory to this location.\nYou can also type cd in the terminal followed by a space character and drag the folder icon of the directory that you want to change to from the file manager into the terminal, and then the full path to that directory will be automatically entered into the terminal for you.\n\nA: It means you need to go to command line and start typing commands (or copy/paste them)4\nHit the super key to open Dash and type \"terminal\"\n\nand you will see something similar to this:\n\nand you can start typing commands.\nThere are 4 methods to get to a command line when using Unity:\n\n*\n\n*Dash -> Search for Terminal\n\n*Dash -> More Apps -> 'See More Results' -> Terminal\n\n*Dash -> More Apps -> Accessories -> Terminal\n\n*Keyboard Shortcut: Ctrl + Alt + T\nFor more information I would suggest reading this wiki page:\n\nWhy use the command-line?\n\"Under Linux there are GUIs (graphical user interfaces), where you can point and click and drag, and hopefully get work done without first reading lots of documentation. The traditional Unix environment is a CLI (command line interface), where you type commands to tell the computer what to do. That is faster and more powerful, but requires finding out what the commands are.\"\n-- from man intro(1)\n\nThe wiki page has a list of the most used commands (like how to change or list a directory, copy or remove files, but also explains how to find commands and how the manual works.\nHere is a list of Bash commands but most of us will probably not know them all ;)\n\nA: It means you have to open a command line. It's a little window with a cursor where you can type commands. Since I can't post images yet, here there is a link with a picture of a terminal in Linux:\nTerminal Picture\nIn Windows language, a terminal could be when you click on start->run command and then you type cmd.\nIn Linux you can do basically everything with the terminal, and personally I suggest you to get used to it and not to be scared of it. It is SUPER useful, especially when your desktop environment dies and there is no way to restart it again graphically. \nHOpe this answers your question :P\n\nA: The following are the same:\n\n\n*\n\n*Open a Terminal\n\n*Open a Console \n\n*Open a Virtual Terminal\nThey refer to what is commonly known as THE TERMINAL!! which looks somethings like this:\n\nThis terminal which is opened in Ubuntu by pressing CTRL+ALT+T is the opposite of a GUI Which is a Graphical User Interface\nand it normally does not use a pointing devices like a mouse. It is commonly used with only the keyboard or a keyboard like interface. You type in the terminal what is called a command to tell the terminal to do something and it replies with an output depending on what you told the terminal. In the image above I used the command ls to tell the terminal to \"List\" all the files in my current directory.\nIf I used the cd which is short for \"Change Directory\" I would change my current directory to another directory that I had added after the cd command. For example cd Downloads would take me to the Downloads directory.\n\nNow in your case, cd is just used to take you to another directory where you downloaded and maybe decompressed already a file you downloaded.\n", "Q: Wi-Fi is active in monitored, but Wi-Fi Lamp Indicator isn't turned on Wi-Fi is active in screen monitored, but Wi-Fi Lamp Indicator in my laptop isn't turned on (should turned on).

I need to know how to make a Ubuntu server that will backup ALL the files on about 4 computers that are both PC and MAC, I have the proper hardware, but I don't know where to start with the backup system. Any ideas or help?\n\nA: Take a look at BackupPC.\n\nBackupPC is a high-performance, enterprise-grade backup system for\n  backing up Linux, WinXX PCs, Macs and laptops to a server's disk.\n  Features include clever pooling of identical files, no client-side\n  software, and a powerful Apache/CGI user interface.\n\nAlso you might want to consider doing rsync over SSH.\nAnother option is using Bacula\n\nBacula is a set of Open Source, computer programs that permit you (or\n  the system administrator) to manage backup, recovery, and verification\n  of computer data across a network of computers of different kinds.\n  Bacula is relatively easy to use and efficient, while offering many\n  advanced storage management features that make it easy to find and\n  recover lost or damaged files.

I couldn't really find any detailed answers regarding LVM on the net.

Wine is still a compatibility layer that may have some problems, and incompatibility.  \nOne other thing you can try is Playonlinux, although it may have the same results as Wine.  You may look at the Wine AppDB, where you can get information on application compatibility with Wine.\nYou may also look at Creative suite for Linux.\n\nA: Wine is an excellent way to run Windows programs on Linux although it still cannot run everything 100%, although older versions of Photoshot and such have been known to work properly...\nWhat you could try is VirtualBox which is available in the Software Centre and allows you to install Windows inside a window and runs a perfect Windows environment from which to install and launch your Windows applications...\nBe warned that since this is an emulation of Windows it will run slower, as will any running applications, but it is a good alternative to booting to and from Linux/Win just to run specific software and the Guest Additions package for VirtualBox always manages to speed things up like graphics...\n", "Q: online payment safe in ubuntu 13.04 I would just like to know that is ubuntu and other linux distributions safe for online payments ??\nthe latest versions.\ngenerally most people want web safety \n. People say that ubuntu is very secure so is it safe for online transactions or is there a catch involved ?\n\nA: Yes, Ubuntu is a highly secure and protected operating system, a number of steps have been taken to ensure that it is a highly secure OS. However, if one visits malicious sites and allows malicious content to enter their system, that is not something the OS or your web browser can prevent.\nI've been using Ubuntu as my primary OS for about a year and  a half now, so a large number of hours have been clocked online, purchases have been made online and yet, i don't have an anti virus software installed on my system, so in conclusion I'd say that it is a largely safe OS.\n", "Q: I can't use the terminal while gedit command is running I recently installed 12.04.\nWhen I try to edit a file with gedit, I can't use the terminal until I close the editing file or I have to open a new terminal. But I think I didn't have this problem with 11.04, however I'm not sure.\nIs there anyway to avoid this and to use same terminal while editing files.\n\nA: Short Answer\nIn the unresponsive terminal:\n\n*\n\n*Hit Ctrl+Z.\n\n*Type bg and enter.\n\n*Type disown and enter.\n\nLong Answer\nIn the unresponsive terminal, hit Ctrl+Z, this will \"pause\" the process (or \"job\") and return the console control to you. However, you'll notice that gedit becomes unresponsive and you can't use it.\n\nExtra: if you want to, you can execute the command jobs, you'll notice that it'll read Stopped for the gedit command, that's why you can't use it.\n\nTo make the job successfully run in the background (i.e. to make gedit responsive again), execute the command bg (meaning background). You'll now be able to use gedit, and at the same time have the prompt to yourself.\n\nExtra: now, if you  execute jobs, you'll notice that it'll read Running.\n\nYou can overcome all of this from the very beginning. When you're launching gedit from the terminal, add an & to the end of the command, so something like this gedit /path/to/file &. This will launch gedit in the background from the first place (you might need to hit Enter a couple of times to get the console control back).\n\nExtra: if you were following these extra notes, you might have noticed that the second time you did jobs, you could see that bash added a & to the end of the gedit command.\n\nOnce you get used to this system, you might notice that if you close the terminal, gedit will also terminate, without even a confirmation dialog. To prevent this from happening, run disown, which will detach the gedit process from the terminal, removing it from the list returned by jobs.\n\nA: Just type:\ngedit <filename-to-edit> &\nThis will immediately return the command prompt to you.\n\nA: You could use the nohup to prevent the GUI to be attached to a terminal:\nnohup mupdf some.pdf &\n\nThis will allow you to close the terminal you are launching from, without the program being closed.\nYou should also notice, that the nohup command will create a file with the stdout and stderr of the command you run. If you want to prevent that, add &>/dev/null before the &.\nnohup mupdf some.pdf &>/dev/null &\n\n\nA: You can also use disown command. It is particularly useful when you've already started the process you no longer want attached to the terminal. \nThe basic procedure if I remember correctly, is something like this:\n$ > firefox      #Oops\nCtrl + z         #Suspend the process\n$ > bg           #Push the process to the background\n$ > disown       #Detach most recent process started or stopped\n$ > exit         #Terminal gone!\n\nNote that disown is bash specific.\nThis blog post explains both methods pretty well.\nMan page for disown\n\nA: From man gedit:\n\n-b, --background\n         Run gedit in the background.\n\n\nSo, if you run gedit with -b option, it will start in background:\ngedit -b [FILE-NAME]\n\nMoreover, next you can create an alias for gedit -b (see here how to create a permanent alias):\nalias gedit='gedit -b'\n\nFrom now, in the future you can use gedit [FILE-NAME] as normal and it will start in background.\n\nA: Just type:\ngedit FILENAME & disown\n\nEnding a command with & in bash runs that command in the background. However, that process is still attached to the terminal.\nWithout disown, if you close the terminal, gedit will close, without even prompting you to save an edited file. disown detaches the background process from the current terminal, so that if you close the terminal, gedit will continue to run as normal. Turns out I was wrong, this is not the case for bash, but it is the case for zsh. You still need to run detach after doing ctrl-z and bg, though, even in bash.\nYou can find out more about the built-ins jobs, disown and the & metacharacter in the manpage for the bash command , especially the section labelled \"job control\".\n\nA: This is probably because you opened gedit via terminal. When you do this, you see the command line output that is normally hidden if started via the GUI. The best way to fix this is to open a new terminal window. The other will become available after gedit closes. You can also use the switch the above user suggested.\n", "Q: Reboot from terminal waiting running apps to quit Sometimes (~once in a month), my Ubuntu won't wake up from sleep correctly (it just shows black screen instead of asking for password). In these situations I go to first terminal (Ctrl+Alt+F1) and do \"sudo reboot now\" (or \"sudo reboot\").\nBut sudo reboot immediately reboots the system, without waiting firefox to exit.\nIs there a way to wait until software will quit nicely, waiting at least 10-20 seconds? Thanks!\n\nA: As per this answer, reboot do not immediately reboots the system, but has a clean-up procedure that also sends the TERM signal to all processes (see the source code linked in the answer).\nIt is up to the processes receiving the signal to handle that signal and clean-up before exiting.\nAlternatively, a somehow softer alternative could be to stop the display manager before the reboot:\nsudo service lightdm stop\nsudo reboot\n\n", "Q: When I try to reset my password using root I couldn't type When I try to reset my password from the root menu using the passwd command, it says \"type new unix password\", but I can't type.\nPlease help!\n\nA: As Eliah Kagan said in this comment, it's normal not to see anything when entering a password on a command-line in Ubuntu.\nIf you still want to see placeholder characters like * as you type, follow next instructions:\n\n\n*\n\n*Install rlwrap tool by running next command in terminal:\nsudo apt-get install rlwrap\n\n*Use next command when you want to change your paswword:\nrlwrap passwd\nMoreover, next you can create an alias for rlwrap passwd (see here how to create a permanent alias):\nalias passwd='rlwrap passwd'\n\nFrom now, in the future you can use passwd as normal and you will see * characters when you type the password as you expect.\n\nA: You are typing your password just you can't see it. This is for security purpose. Normally when you type password (windows)you get the length of password from the number of asterisks. But here you can't get even that. \nThis happens only in terminal. When you need to enter your password in some GUI (commads like gksu pops up dialog box to enter the password), you can see the asterisks(*) or other character as you type it. \n", "Q: How to Launch Guitar pro 6 I thought I would give this one more go,I recently downloaded the full linux demo version of guitar pro 6 (r11201).

Its a GUI that allows you control over GRUB2 settings and menuentries.  To install Grub Customizer, just press Ctrl+Alt+T on your keyboard to open Terminal. When it opens, run the command(s) below:\nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:adabbas/1stppa\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get install grub-customizer\n\nOr you can do it manually by editing the grub.cfg file, located at /boot/grub/grub.cfg. \n", "Q: Problem in .bashrc I try to edit .bashrc to view the C-compilers that I installed before.\nBut after opening the new terminal I am stuck with strange error.\nI am unable to ls the files/directories and nothing works.

It same works in the converse too, so it's not an issue with Ubuntu, nor is it a bug.\n\nA: Virtually logic.  :-) - when you want lock the system inside virtualbox.

It seems that your installation does not have cryptsetup installed. Install it: cryptsetup  and try again.\n\nHow can I find the password to a drive partition if I forgot it?\n\nWell, the whole purpose of the hard drive encryption is to keep the data safe for ones not having the password. Storing the password on the system would basically undermine the whole purpose of running encryption in the first place. Passwords are for you to remember, not to store anywhere!\n", "Q: how to control pen tablet pressure input with a joystick? ) \ni have a pen tablet Genius G-pen F610 and its working perfectly in Ubuntu 12.04\nbut for drawing purpuses i need to block pen pressure input (which is easy to do mechanicly just by removing the plastic tip of the pen)\nand then somehow to control the presure by gamepad or joystick, for example the more I move the joystick to the left the more pressure is detected (by drawing software) to be coming from the pen   \nthe result should be that I am still drawing lines with the pen but the thickness of the line is controlled by joystick\nthanks for all suggestions\n\nA: I don't think there is any easy way to accomplish that, Gimp has some functionality to read from other input devices, but I don't think you can freely mix and match inputs from different devices (see Edit->Input Devices and Preferences->Input Devices). Not sure about Krite, MyPaint and all the other graphics apps.\nLinux however has the uinput interface that lets you create virtual input devices and with that you can read input events from your tablet and your gamepad and mix them together into a virtual input device.

It should not take the arguments from the user. Everything from the path and content is predefined. How can I do it?\n\nA: Just use output redirection. E.g.\n#!/bin/bash\n\necho \"some file content\" > /path/to/outputfile\n\nThe > will write all stdin provided by the stdout of echo to the file outputfile here.\nAlternatively, you could also use tee and a pipe for this. E.g.\necho \"some file content\" | tee outputfile\n\nBe aware that any of the examples will overwrite an existing outputfile.\nIf you need to append to a currently existing file, use >> instead of > or tee -a.\nIf you don't accept user input in this line, no user input can change the behaviour here.\n\nA: I think it is superior to use a here doc to create a new file in a script. It is cleaner looking, which I believe encourages readability.\nFor example:\ncat > filename <<- \"EOF\"\nfile contents\nmore contents\nEOF\n\nThe \"-\" in <<- is optional, allowing for tabbed indents which will be stripped when the file is created.

On my Ubuntu 12.04, the audio server encounters occasional crashes, so that I'm forced to reboot the system in order to have it play audio.\nAlsamixer looks ok, nothing is muted. \nMoreover, I tried \nsudo pkill -9 pulseaudio\n\nand then:\npulseaudio -D\n\nwhich gave me\nE: [pulseaudio] main.c: Daemon startup failed.\n\nCan you help me understand what's wrong?\n\nA: Pulseaudio will run on a per-user basis in a default setup. Therefore we do not need root permissions to kill it. \nThe command to restart/reset a running pulseaudio sound server from a terminal is simply issueing\npulseaudio -k\n\nBy doing to the sound server will autospawn and restart immediately in a default setting. You will always get an error if you try to run pulseaudio twice.\nTo run pulseaudio from command line to read possible errors you will have do temporarily disable the autospawning (see this article for details on how to do this).\nSometimes bad user setting are responsible for a malfunctioning pulseaudio sound server. We may then try to rename the settings directory ~/.pulse (or ./config/pulse in newer releases) before we restart pulseaudio. This directory will then be recreated with default settings.\n\nA: I had a similar error once, what worked for me was editing the default.pa file, at /etc/pulse. Somehow, the first line was !/usr/bin/pulseaudio -nF, and instead of #!/usr/bin/pulseaudio -nF, so upon editing it, pulseaudio worked fine.\n\nA: What worked for me was moving ~/.config/pulse to ~/.config/pulseold. Re-installed my base system and seems that pulseaudio kept crashing trying to use my old configs.\n\nA: I had this problem - after playing around with it, I've figured out how to fix it, although I'm still not sure what's wrong with it. \nFirst find the card and device you want and manually export the PULSE_SINK variable:\n$> aplay -l\n\n\n**** List of PLAYBACK Hardware Devices **** card 0: PCH [HDA Intel PCH], device 0: ALC269VC Analog [ALC269VC Analog]   Subdevices: 1/1\n  Subdevice #0: subdevice #0 card 0: PCH [HDA Intel PCH], device 3: HDMI\n  0 [HDMI 0]   Subdevices: 0/1   Subdevice #0: subdevice #0\n\n$>export PULSE_SINK=plughw:0,3\n$>killall pulseaudio \nNow you should be able to start pulse.\n$> pulseaudio --start\n\nIf not, check /etc/pulse for broken symbolic links and rm -rf ~/.config/pulse.\nThereafter make the default to where you want, check\n$>pacmd list-cards\n\nAfter you find which output you want then, make it the default: \n$> pacmd set-card-profile 0 output:hdmi-stereo\n\nWorks for me, on Ubuntu 16.04. \n", "Q: how to add path to be used for terminal I'm trying to add PHPUnit to the system path so that I can just use it from any terminal window.

My question is simple. \nIs Ubuntu more optimized for text editor-like programs (Libre Office, Sublime Text, etc.) written in Python or not?\nOr there is no difference if I use C++, Python or Java in Ubuntu? \nI have noticed that Python is somehow favored by Ubuntu developers when creating office-like application, catalogues, custom on-demand apps etc. \nAlso, Ubuntu website promote Python here:\nhttp://developer.ubuntu.com/get-started \nand they don't promote C++ or Java on their website. So, I am curious why they promote Python more than C++ or Java?\nOr is it only because the development is faster in Python than in Java or C++?\nI am not asking which programming language is the best (I already know that C++ is the best and mostly used when it comes to graphics and hardware optimization), but I am just curious why is Python so popular in Ubunutu community and if it's just because it's easy to program in this language or if it has some other reason e.g. better performenc in Ubuntu than other languages.\nWhat is the history of the Ubuntu team decision to promote Python as the first language of Ubuntu?\n\nA: In the early days of Ubuntu there were three major projects that tended to influence it. \n\n\n*\n\n*Debian - the core that Ubuntu is based on.\n\n*GNOME - the core that the desktop is based on, and even though the latest client things (phone and tablet) are based on Qt there is still a bunch of GNOME technology in Ubuntu. \n\n*Python - the language that is preferred to tie a bunch of this stuff together.\n\n\nA large percentage of the early Ubuntu community came from one of these other communities, they were either heavily involved or had partcipated. The GNOME and Debian influence on Ubuntu is well documented, but the stealth fact, the third piece is Python, here is a quote from Mark Shuttleworth:\n\nPython plays an important role at Canonical. You could even go so far\n  as to say that Python is the language of choice for the company. Here\n  is a rough list of the projects that are written with Python at\n  Canonical:\n  \n  \n*\n  \n*Bazaar: A distributed version control system. If you haven't tried Bazaar yet, you should give it a try, it is a very lightweight\n  alternative to centralized version control like Subversion\n  launchpad.net: A free software hosting and development web site that\n  makes it easy to, \"collaborate across multiple project\".\n  \n*Storm: Storm is an object-relational mapper for Python that was developed at Canonical and is used inside of launchpad.\n  \n*Landscape: A system management service that allows for centralized management of multiple Ubuntu machines. This is a commercial product\n  that Canonical has rolled out.\n  \n  \n  There has been tremendous buzz about Python's \"infection\" of systems\n  administration and systems programming. It will be interesting to see\n  where this ultimately leads. Will Canonical start writing run levels\n  in Python next?\nTo get some idea of how big of a deal Python is becoming in the Linux\n  world we can also take a look at Red Hat. Red Hat has a Research and\n  Development division called Red Hat Emerging Technology Group. The\n  link to that website can be found here.\nIf you look at the projects listed, Python either plays a role or is\n  the language in which the project is being developed. The future for\n  Linux and Python for both Canonical and Red Hat seems to be bright.\n\nWe take a bunch of cultural ideas from Python, one of the most famous is the idea of a BFL and the idea that there's one clear way to do something:\n\nWe would rather have one super smooth way to get things done, than 50 rougher ways to get things done. This is a bit like the core design value of Python: have one clear way to get something done. It's why I called the company Canonical: find the cleanest, clearest way to do XYZ. And the project is called Ubuntu because it's about humanity in the mass, and the values which support that, rather than about individuals (who were empowered by Linux long before we came along).\n\nAt the time of Ubuntu's launch Python was seeing an immense amount of attention and growth, and given Mark's experience with Python in the past (it was also used at Thawte Consulting) it's not surprising that if you were to build a new Linux distribution that Python was one of the easier choices to make. \nThat's not to say other languages are not welcome, the phone/tablet and soon the desktop will transition to QML and Qt (C++) and Juju was rewritten from Python to golang. Python just tends to be the default for things in Ubuntu. Authors can make tools in Python knowing that it's included in the default OS, so it makes a nice common watermark for people to get started in. Earlier releases of Ubuntu even included Dive into Python by default! \nAs far as Canonical itself, there's usually some form of sponsorship of PyCons, and participation from employees in Python conferences around the world.  \nTLDR; if you start a new project and you're passionate about certain technologies and you surround yourself with people who share those goals and beliefs, you can build awesome things.  \n", "Q: what should i do if ubuntu 13.04 needs to reboot to fully install but won't? i currently have a mac os x 10.7.5 and used VirtualBoxVM to install ubuntu 13.04. i went through the whole process and the os is created, but the only problem is it needs to reboot but it stays stuck on the reboot message. it says its a broadcast message from root@ubuntu..the system is going down for reboot NOW! modem manager 1436 caught signal 15, shutting down..this message just remains and if i try shutting it down with my other os in the background, it restarts and does the same thing when i start ubuntu again. how do i get past this point to fully install ubuntu as my only OS?\nit gave me 2 options when installing: 1) to test ubuntu out before wiping my mac os 2) fully install and replace mac with ubuntu. i chose the second. i filled out all username, location and password info. the new os is created, the system needs to reboot now but won't like i said. \napparently the virtualbox is a cd according to comments below, and to complete the process i need to eject it. how is that done?

I have a dual boot PC with Windows XP & Ubuntu which I recently installed. I can't see any of my Ubuntu files in XP. Where is Ubuntu installed on my computer?\nWhile installing Ubuntu, I used the default option and allocated 9 GB for it. In XP, one of the drives which was 15 GB in size now shows 8.34 GB as full capacity & 8.28 GB as free space. Has Ubuntu been installed there? If so, how can I increase the size of my Ubuntu partition from 9 GB to 15 GB (Ubuntu has already been installed)?\nScreenshot of GParted:\n\n\nA: \nWhere is Ubuntu installed on my computer?\n\nIt's on a separate partition, with an Ext4 filesystem. You can't see that in Windows as it does not support that kind of filesystem by default. Open a partition editor and you'll see there's a second partition there next to a NTFS one.\n\nhow can i increase the size of my Ubuntu partition from 9 GB to 15 GB\n\nYou could use a Ubuntu Live CD and start a partition editor to resize the partitions. (GParted for example)\nSee also:\n\n\n*\n\n*How to resize partitions?\n\n*How do I resize my current ubuntu partition?\n\nA: Since Ubuntu uses the Ext4 file system by default, which windows can't read. You cannot see  the files of your Ubuntu partition on windows.\nWindows uses the NTFS file system by default, which can be read by Ubuntu.\nSo if you want to transfer files between the two partitions I would suggest you boot your machine in Ubuntu and work from there.\nRe-sizing partitions should also be done from ubuntu (for example using th partitioning tool GParted which handles ext4 as well as NTFS).\n\nA: First of all, ensure that you have a backup of all the data on your hard disk. Playing around with partitions can be dangerous. Just follow the exact steps I mention, and you should be fine\nSecond, I noticed that you have used 3GB from sda12, which is the partition named \"Linux\". We will be deleting this partition, and everything in it will be gone. If you need the data on it, please take a copy of it before proceeding. This partition is not your Ubuntu partition, it's just the partition that you see in Windows called Linux.\nThird, in Linux, there's a partition that you can create called swap. This partition is optional, but is almost always needed. The purpose of this partition (without getting into detail) is to make Ubuntu work faster, so the following steps will include this partition. We'll be making it 4GB. So in the end, your Ubuntu partition will be 11GB out of that 15GB. You can skip it (which is step 2 in the steps below), although I advise you don't.\nFourth, in the end, when we start the process, it might take a long time to finish. Resizing and moving partitions usually takes time. In your case however, your partitions aren't that large, but still, it might take 1-2 hours or something. If this is a laptop, ensure that it is plugged into a power source.\nFifth, and finally, read the whole answer before doing anything.\nOkay, you first need to boot into live Ubuntu. Boot from a bootable USB/CD just like if you were going to install Ubuntu, but choose \"Try Ubuntu\" not \"Install Ubuntu\". Open GParted, and follow the steps below:\n\n\n*\n\n*Right click on /dev/sda12 > Delete\n\n*Right click on the now unallocated space > New\n\n*\n\n*In New size (MiB), type 4096\n\n*Make sure Free space preceding (MiB) is 0 (it's okay if it's 1, or some small number, and you can't change it) \n\n*Change File System to be linux-swap\n\n*Click Add (or OK, or whatever the button is)\n\n*Now, you should see a swap partition and unallocated under it\n\n\n*Right click on /dev/sda16 > Resize/Move\n\n*See the bar on top in this resize window? We need to \"expand\" it to the left, so drag the left end of it (the little left black arrow) to the left until the end, and click OK (or Resize, or whatever). You should now not see any unallocated space.\n\n*Right click on /dev/sda17 > Delete\n\n*Right click on /dev/sda16 > Resize/Move\n\n*We'll do the same thing in step 4, but expand it to the right. So drag the right arrow to the end, and click OK.\n\n*Everything that we've done actually hasn't happened yet. GParted is just recording these \"actions\", and now we need to apply them. But before we apply them, take a look at your partitions now. You should find that you now have a linux-swap partition (4GB) and under it your Ubuntu sda16 partition (around 11GB). If this is not the setup that you see, then please close GParted and restart from the beginning. (If there is unallocated space of 1MB or something like that, you can just ignore it.)\n\n*Once you have checked, double-checked, triple-checked, hit the green \"check mark\" in GParted to apply all operations.\n\n\nAlternatively\nDo you need your current installation of Ubuntu, or can you delete it and reinstall it? This will make things much easier. If you can delete it, just do this:\nIn GParted, right click and delete sda12, sda16 and sda17, this will leave a big 15GB unallocated space. Apply the changes in GParted. Now, start the Ubuntu installation. When presented with options, choose \"Install Ubuntu alongside Windows XP\". This will install Ubuntu into that 15GB space automatically (it will take care of creating the swap partition and all that).\n\nOkay, after the comments, do this:\n\n\n*\n\n*Delete the unknown partition\n\n*Right click and resize your Ubuntu partition sda14. Give it a new size of 16GB (16384 MiB), and make sure that the free space is on the right (don't worry, you shouldn't see the error message about booting problems. If you see it, just ignore it, this time it doesn't really matter because we didn't \"move\" the Ubuntu partition).\n\n*Now, you should see around 4GB of unallocated space. Right click it > New, and choose file system as linux-swap, and hit OK.\n\n*That's it. Take a look at the partition table. It should be like the screenshot you added in the comments, but sda14 as 16GB and linux-swap after it as 4GB. Apply. Reboot.\n\n", "Q: Installation of cmake 2.8.11 on ubuntu 13.04 I tried to install cmake 2.8.11 on Ubuntu 13.04. I got cmake 2.8.11 source and during installing some errors happened.

However not a single solution posted on the net works.\n\n*\n\n*I tried a right-click using Nautilus actions as described in multiple posts.\n\n*Using the lpr command in the terminal and dragging files from Nautilus. Here print opens but files are held, and when the release button is pressed, the window closes without action.\n\n*With a script as posted here: Printing a file from the right-click context menu in Nautilus\nThe only method that works is combining pdf files in pdfmod to a new large file, saving it, and printing it. Not very elegant.\nSince no option for multiple works, could the community have a fresh look at right-click printing from Nautilus?\n\nA: I just added a right-click menu option that allows you to select multiple files, select Script → pdf-printer.sh and it'll create PDF files. If you choose another printer name in the script, it should use that instead, but I can't verify that. Older how-tos might not work because we've moved to GNOME 3 which has a few changes. In this case, scripts have been moved from ~/.gnome2/nautilus-scripts to ~/.local/share/nautilus/scripts. Otherwise, everything should work as you would expect.\n\n*\n\n*Install http://apt.ubuntu.com/p/cups-pdf. This package provides a PDF printer that prints to the PDF folder in your home folder, $HOME/PDF.\n\n\n*Open Nautilus and create a folder named PDF in your home.\n\n\n*Press Ctrl+H in Nautilus to show hidden files.\n\n\n*Open ~/.local/share/nautilus/scripts.\n\n\n*Create a new file and call it pdf-printer.sh.\n\n\n*Paste the following:\n#!/bin/bash\n#\n# pdf-printer.sh\n#\n# Print files from the right-click context menu in Nautilus.\n# Place this script in ~/.local/share/nautilus/scripts.\n# The printer to use (as shown in the Printer Configuration\n# gui or in /etc/cups/printers.conf).\nprinter=PDF\necho \"$NAUTILUS_SCRIPT_SELECTED_FILE_PATHS\" | while read file\n    do\n        lpr -P \"$printer\" \"$file\"\ndone\nexit 0\n\n\n\n*Save the file and close it.\n\n\n*right-click the file and choose Properties → Permissions. Make sure the box is checked to allow executing the file.\nIt is possible that you have to restart Nautilus for this to work. In that case, you can press Alt+F2 and enter r. Should that not work, then you can press Alt+F2 and enter killall nautilus or restart the system.\nOther than that, you should now be able to select files, right-click and use the script from the Script menu.\n", "Q: Can't start Windows 7 I get this error message:\nWindows Boot Manager  \nWindows failed to start.

You'll need to download a Windows 7 ISO (perfectly legally, as long as you're using it in conjunction with a legal licence) and run the Startup Repair option.\nIf burning to DVD doesn't work for you, and you have access to another Windows PC, you can use the Windows 7 USB Installer Tool to create a bootable USB installer.\n", "Q: Recursive grep fails for *.c files I tried to recursively search a pattern in all the .c files in the following way\n> grep -lr search-pattern *.c\n\nBut got this as the output\n> grep: *.c: No such file or directory\n\nWhen I use this:\n> grep -lr search-pattern *\n\nI get plenty of . c files in the directories with the pattern.\nWhat is wrong with the earlier expression?\n\nA: The *.c pattern is evaluated by your shell. It applies to the current directory, just like you would using ls *.c.\nI think what you want instead is to find all files matching the *.c pattern (recursively) and have grep search for you in it. Here's a way to do that:\nfind . -name \"*.c\" -print0 | xargs --null grep -l search-pattern\n\nIt uses xargs to append the search results by find.\n\nAlternatively, use the -exec option to find, e.g.:\nfind . -name \"*.c\" -exec grep -l search-pattern \"{}\" \\;\n\n\nAlso, I'm not sure if you really want the -l option to grep. It will stop at the first match:\n-l, --files-with-matches\n      Suppress normal output; instead print the name of  each\n      input  file  from which output would normally have been\n      printed.  The scanning will stop on  the  first  match.\n      (-l is specified by POSIX.)\n\n\nA: I suggest to use the --include option of grep:\ngrep -lr --include='*.c' search-pattern .\n\n\nA: As the grep documentation states in its discussion of the -r option:\n\"If no folder name is given, grep command will search the string inside the current working directory.\"\n\ntherefore, your original command line (ignoring the -l flag):\n\ngrep -lr search-pattern *.c\n\nis recursively searching, within the files in the current directory whose filenames end in .c,  for \"search-pattern\". It will find nothing if there are no such files in the current directory.\nYour second command line (again ignoring the -l flag):\n > grep -lr search-pattern *\n\nis recursively searching for \"search-pattern\" in all files in the current directory and all subdirectories (because * is being interpreted as a wild card for \"folder name\").\nYour two command lines will both \"recursively search a pattern in all the .c files\", the first in the current directory, the second by recursive descent of the current directory and all subdirectories, if you eliminate the \"-l\" flag from both of them.\nThe discussion that follows presumes that your intent is simply recursing over the .c files in the current directory for your search (as implied by your first command line).\nDiscussion:\nMy preference would be to leave the task of finding and listing the files of interest to ls the utility that is built for that purpose, having it list them one filename per line. I would then construct the command line for grep with xargs (the utility built for that purpose) from the output of ls and the pattern that you want grep to look for (thus using grep in the most natural way). The resulting command looks like this:\nls -1 *.c | xargs grep \"C.*t\"\n\nTest Case:\nIn a directory with the following contents:\nErlang  hello.cs  hello.exe  somefile.c  someotherfile.c\nto follow your description of the intent, I will expect my command line to find the files somefile.c and someotherfile.c, and search within these for a pattern that starts with a capital C and ends with a lowercase t.\nThe file somefile.c consists of:\nIgnore this!\nContent\n... this too ...\n... and this.\n\nThe file someotherfile.c consists of\nContent to find\nIngore this\n\nand our command\nls -1 *.c | xargs grep \"C.*t\"\n\nproduces this result:\nsomefile.c:Content\nsomeotherfile.c:Content to find\n\nsupplying the  -v  argument to grep gives us the inverse result, i.e.,\nthe command:\nls -1 *.c | xargs grep -v \"C.*t\"\n\ngives the result:\nsomefile.c:Ignore this!\nsomefile.c:... this too ...\nsomefile.c:... and this.\nsomeotherfile.c:Ingore this\n\n\nA: I know this is a rather old thread, but since I had the same question, I wanna share my preferred way of acheiving the same, In a much shorter form.\nls | grep \"file.*.c\"\n\n", "Q: Nteflix streams really choppy I installed netflix on edubuntu 12.04lts. it will stream movies but is real choppy. I know its not my comp  unable to handle because i use to have windows on here and it ran fine. Is there any fixes to get the choppiness to stop \n\nA: On Ubuntu, you are running netflix through wine, a sort of Windows emulation software, because Netflix won't support Linux. This is not so efficient as running the Netflix software natively. I've found it can work, but it seems to be sensitive to everything else running on your system as well as the quality of your wifi signal.\nTry it with a good wifi signal with nothing else running.\n", "Q: migrating from Windows: will mozyhome and itunes be accessible? I am thinking of buying a new laptop with Ubuntu pre-installed.\nI have backed up everything from my current comuter to the cloud using MozyHome.\nI would like to know\n\n\n*\n\n*will downloading all my files again onto my new Ubuntu machine work?\n\n*will I somehow be able to play all of the iTunes music files which I\nhave backed up?\n\n\nI don't want to have to reinstall iTunes, or any other of the bloated corporate software I am trying to get away from with this (possible) switch...\n\nA: Welcome to AskUbuntu and StackExchange!\nFrom a glance at the Mozy download page, they don't offer a Linux client, so you may have difficulties there. A good alternative is DropBox, who give you 2GB space for free and supports Mac, Linux and Windows.\niTunes is also Windows/Mac only, but the good news is that (unprotected) iTunes music files are compatible with any number of Ubuntu's media players; though if you have any tracks with DRM, you may not be able to play them.\nMy advice would be to create MP3 copies of all your tracks before moving to Ubuntu - see this Apple KB article.\n", "Q: How to use palaver on ubuntu 13.04 32bit? I tried a lot to install palaver speech recognition software. But I have failed many a time. But eventually I installed it. However, I cannot use it! That's the problem.

Remember, you press, for instance, \"Ctrl+L\" to trigger the microphone, and again \"Ctrl+L\" to stop it)\n", "Q: Can I create a setup file out of already installed files? I have used an Android phone and was very much impressed to learn that it is based on Linux. I had an application there named \"Super Manager\" from play store. It has many features but my favorite is that it can convert installed apps into .apk files and using those I can install the same apps on other phones as well either through memory card or through backup.\nI was wondering if the same feature would be available in Ubuntu, because I have another PC which doesn't have internet so I can't download applications directly from Ubuntu Software Center. I am pretty new in Linux environment as I have been using Windows so long, so asked this just out of curiosity. Help will be much appreciated. Thanks a lot friends.\n\nA: To obtain a list of installed packages we may use the inbuilt command line Debian package manager dpkg [manpage for the dpkg command] with the option --get-selections. Below command will generate a file packages.list of all installed packages (including the default packages) in the directory you opened the terminal in:\ndpkg --get-selections > packages.list\n\nFor a more elaborate answer on how to further use this list for backup purposes see\n\n\n*\n\n*How to backup settings and list of installed packages\nWe may also use the sync function from the Ubuntu Software Center to syncronize installed applications between computers:\n\n\n*\n\n*How to use the sync between computers in Software Center\n\nA: there is a small tiny script named cde which, once ran, it can compile any installed app and all its dependencies and libraries in use into a portable app folder. Then you can copy that folder to your other machine and then you have two options, or use them as portable or copy by hand any file into its proper location. To do the last you may follow the portable folder file system as a guide to copy to the machine own files. Be careful to not overwrite newer versions of any library.\n", "Q: Ubuntu Haswell HD4600 driver not loading I have a lenovo y410p.

I know I can file a bug report on the local machine by running ubuntu-bug.

Can I use Ubuntu's bug reporting tools to gather data about the bug remotely, transfer that data to my local machine and submit a bug report here with the data from the other system?\n\nA: The \"Filing bugs when off-line\" section of the bug reporting community help can be applied here:\n\nFirst, on the target system, gather the information in a file:\n  \n  \n*\n  \n*For a bug report about a system crash:\napport-cli -p <package name> --save bug.crash\n  \n*For a bug report about any other issue:\napport-cli -f -p <package name> --save bug.apport\nYou will need to answer a few questions, which will vary depending on\n  which package the bug report is about. Relevant system information,\n  including the package name, is then saved on the target system, in the\n  current directory. The extension indicates if it is a crash report or\n  another kind of report. If you decide to rename the report file,\n  please keep the .apport or .crash extension.\nWhen the file is ready, copy it to the system you intend to use for\n  filing the report.

When installing Ubuntu 12, when it comes to drive partition it offers to run it alongside Windows, in 13.0.4, it offers to delete all other OS's, or Encrypt the new Ubuntu installation for security, or Use LVM with the new Ubuntu installation, and lastly, Something Else.  Something else  just confuses me.  Any tutorials or ideas?  thanks.\n\nA: Firstly, decide which option you want to use. There are only three ways you can use Ubuntu.\n\n\n*\n\n*Run it as the sole OS on your system.\n\n*Run it alongside any other OSs you may have previously installed on your system.\n\n*Run it from inside Windows.\nFor the first two options, you need to boot your system with the live CD or the USB plugged in. For the third option, while you are booted into Windows, run your live CD or USB and you can install Ubuntu as any other application in Windows and boot into it while booting your system.\nSince you've not made it clear what you want to do and are referring to \"something else\", I will assume you want to play with your partitions. If you just want to install ubuntu along side windows or as the sole OS, choose the relevant option. If not, then here goes:\n\n\n*\n\n*Choose Something Else, this will take you to the partition manager. Here you will see the the different operating systems installed on your hard disk along with their size and file system. This is just like the \"Disk Usage\" you see in the properties option in Windows for your drives, without the pie chart.\n\n*If you have Windows installed, you will most likely see Microsoft Windows XP/Vista/7 with file system as NTFS and its size in bytes.\n\n*Alongside it you will see, if any, the unallocated space on your hard disk. This space is currently not only empty, it is unallocated to any filesytem or operating system. This is different from the disk usage you see in Windows as windows does not have control over this unallocated space.\n\n*Now you have several options. Each \"partition\" on your hard disk can be manipulated from here. You can either delete a partition or choose to keep it. You can also make a new partition out of the unallocated space, if any. Note that when you delete a partition, all data is permanently erased and the space added in the unallocated space.\n\n*Now you can either choose to delete your Windows partition(not recommended, especially without proper backup) to make space for your Ubuntu install if you dont have enough unallocated space(ubuntu would tell you so) or to make a new partition from the unallocated space and install ubuntu there.(recommended)\n\n*Note that making a new partition and installing Ubuntu on it would install Ubuntu alongside Windows, just like in the first option I mentioned earlier. So if you are simply looking to do that, cancel everything, no harm is done yet, return back and choose that option. Its much simpler.\n\n*If you wish to proceed with manually setting the partition, then select the unallocated space and press enter. It would ask you some details about the new partition you want to create. For size, allocate as much as you want in bytes(1MB = 1024*1024 bytes), the filesystem(choose ext4), the Mount Point for the install(choose /) and whether or not you want to encrypt your home directory(your discretion).\n\n*When you have selected the proper options are described above, then confirm your settings and a new partition will be created and would be named something like /dev/sda2 or /dev/sda3 etc.\n\n*if you get the size of the partition wrong the first time, reformat it simply till you get the right size. Just dont play with the existing Windows partition.\n\n*When you have what you want, choose the partition and confirm it as the partition you want to install ubuntu on. Click enter and enjoy the show.\nThat should about get you through the partition manager and teach you a few things as well. If you are afraid of getting stuck, remember the golder rule : Backup First! \n", "Q: Frostwire does not start I downloaded Frostwire from this page.

I know of the default setting in Nautilus to set the default view, but that sets it for all directories. What I'm looking for is to set the \"list view\" for specific folders, but Nautilus does not seem to remember my settings when I change it for a folder.\nCurrent Behavior:\nThe current default view is set to Icon View. If I open Nautilus, go into a directory, say Documents, and change it to List view, it changes successfully. Subsequently, everything in this Nautilus session also changes to List view, so if I go back to my Home folder and any other folder, they're also in List view. Now, if I close and reopen Nautilus, everything is set back to Icon view, even the Documents folder.\nWhat I've tried\n\n*\n\n*I've tried deleting all the files under the directory ~/.local/share/gvfs-metadata mentioned in this answer, but it didn't seem to do anything.\n\n*My current setup is that /home is on a separate partition, while the subfolders (Documents, Downloads, etc...) are symlinked to an NTFS partition. I thought that might be the issue, but the same thing happens if I try what I mentioned above on a folder directly under /home/.\n\n*This question is similar, but it doesn't help.\n\n*I've tried installing the Thunar file manager, but it also has the same issue.\n\n*I've tried installing the PCManFM file manager, but it also has the same issue.\n\nIs this the default, normal behavior of Nautilus?

It does not remember the view settings per folder; it's just one global setting in File > Preferences > Default View section. This change probably came starting from Nautilus 3.5.x, as pointed out in @Chriki's answer.\nHowever, Nemo file manager does remember the view settings for each folder, so I ended up installing it.\nTo install the latest stable Nemo release, type the following in a terminal:\nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:gwendal-lebihan-dev/cinnamon-stable\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get install nemo\n\nSource: How to install Nemo file manager in Ubuntu\n\nA: That seems to be a bug indeed, see https://bugzilla.gnome.org/show_bug.cgi?id=683802. Judging from Bugzilla comment https://bugzilla.gnome.org/show_bug.cgi?id=686499#c0 and from the fact that the required functionality is still working for me in Nautilus 3.4.2, this appears to have changed somewhere during Nautilus 3.5.x development.\nBTW, just for completeness’ sake: I have also tried to change the per folder view in some symlinked NTFS folders. At least for me that worked without a problem in Nautilus 3.4.2 (Ubuntu 12.04).\n\nA: Answer by Alaa Ali is right. However for Ubuntu 14.04 LTS, to install Nemo, use the following code\nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:webupd8team/nemo \nsudo apt-get update \nsudo apt-get install nemo nemo-fileroller\n\nSource: Intall Nemo 2.2 with Unity patches\n", "Q: Have Ubuntu 12.04 want to instal 13.04 I have 12.04 installed, want to instal 13.04, will it just overwrite 12.04 or do I need to uninstal 12.04.  Will my files, and other downloads still be accessable?\n\nA: \"sudo do-release-upgrade\" will do everything you need. No need to uninstall the previous, and it will not mess with any of your user account files.\nThis would need to be a two-step upgrade. There is no supported method for skipping upgrades, but some quick searches around askubuntu have turned up some duplicates:\nhttps://askubuntu.com/questions/287906/upgrade-from-12-04-to-13-04 \nCan I skip over releases when upgrading?\n\nA: You can not upgrade directly from 12.04 to 13.04 as Ubuntu only upgrades to the next newest version, i.e. running sudo do-release-upgrade would only upgrade from 12.04 to 12.10 in your case, then you will have to again run the upgrade to 13.04.\nReference\n\nAn upgrade is the process of going from an earlier version of Ubuntu\n  to a newer version of Ubuntu with an installed system. An example of\n  this would be going from Ubuntu 11.10 to Ubuntu 12.04 LTS. To avoid\n  damaging your running system, upgrading should only be done from one\n  release to the next release (e.g. Ubuntu 12.04 to Ubuntu 12.10) or\n  from one LTS release to the next (e.g. Ubuntu 10.04 LTS to Ubuntu\n  12.04 LTS). If you wish to 'skip' a version, you can backup your data and do a fresh installation, or progressively upgrade to each\n  successive version. For example, to upgrade from Ubuntu 11.10 to\n  Ubuntu 12.10, first upgrade to 12.04, then upgrade 12.04 to 12.10.\n\nHence, a fresh install is recommended for you. However, if you do not want to lost data while doing a fresh install, while installing,\n1. Take a backup of your files.\n\n\n*\n\n*Choose to install through manual partitioning.Do not format the existing partitions(make sure all format check boxes are unchecked)\n\n*Install the new version on the same partition as the previous version and use the same username and password as the previous version.\n\nRenewing the Installation without formatting the partitions (in\n  contrast to upgrading), will also keep the personal data and\n  configurations under /home but will renew all system settings under\n  /etc as well as the default set of installed packages.\n\nSee also: Upgrading to 13.04 Raring Ringtail \n\nA: Yes, you can perform a new Ubuntu installation and choose to keep your home folder. Of course, you'll need to reinstall your apps, but configs and stuff should stay the same. But you always want to have a backup before doing stuff like this. Evolution can break, for instance. \n\nA: You could also use the Software Updater... You can open it from the dash, of the wheel in the top right-hand side of your desktop. First you'll need to edit its settings (button in the bottom left-hand corner) :\nSet \"Notice me of a new Ubuntu Version\" to \"For any new version\"\nTo get a notice concerning 12.10 and 13.04, which are not LTS. :-)\n", "Q: What's the difference between transmission-daemon and service transmission-daemon? I have an Ubuntu Server machine, which I access via SSH.\nI want to use it to handle my torrents from any device and have them stored somewhere steadily.\nToday I took the first step and installed the transmission package, along with the daemon, cli, etc..\nSo I was testing the basic functionality, and I noticed that the command transmission-daemon + options behaved differently from the command service transmission-daemon + options. Particularly, the first did not accept a straight start option, for example.\nSo, in order not to confuse myself before proceeding, and since this could help me more generally, I would like to have an informative and understandable description of what I should be aware of with regards to services and daemons, how are they implemented, roughly, and any information that could help me handle the transmission daemon, in particular.\n\nA: transmission-daemon by itself is a direct invocation of the program /usr/bin/transmission-daemon. This directly accepts options, but is not the correct way of running the daemon - it will run as yourself and hence exit when you log off.\nservice transmission-daemon refers to a script /etc/init.d/transmission-daemon. This script checks for a running instance of transmission-daemon when starting/restarting etc, and runs the daemon as a specific user (also called transmission-daemon). This is also the mechanism that will automatically launch the daemon at startup, if enabled.\nYou shouldn't edit this script to add options, but rather the daemon's configuration file - /etc/transmission-daemon/settings.json. See the transmission website for an explanation of the options. Note that you'll need to stop transmission-daemon (sudo service transmission-daemon stop) before making changes, otherwise the daemon will overwrite the settings with the ones it is currently using when it exits.\n", "Q: Why does `startx /usr/bin/unity` not load my desktop settings? I am trying to open a second X session with unity on display :1.\nFor this to achieve I open another terminal (e.g. tty 6) with Ctrl + Alt +6 and login as the user whose desktop session I want to start. When I start the X session with unity as a client on display :1, unity loads but does not adhere to my desktop settings.\nThis is how I start the session:\n$ startx /usr/bin/unity -- :1\n\nThis does not work properly: \n\n\n*\n\n*Startup applications don't start.\n\n*dconf settings are not read (e.g. org.gnome.desktop.interface.text-scaling-factor)\n\n*The language of the desktop is not correct (This user's desktop should be English while my main user has a German desktop).\n\n*... maybe other stuff I did not notice.\n\n\nI also tried to start X with\n$ startx -- :1\n\nThis shows the correct desktop wallpaper but does not show anything else (no xterm, no panels, no dash, ...). But Ctrl + Alt +T opens a decorated terminal and I can start unity. That loads unity with almost everything I need. But the language still is German.\nI also tried appending unity to ~/.xinitrc but that did not change anything.\nCan someone point out my mistakes? An optimal solution for me would be to being able to start a second unity session with startx -- :1.\n\nA: If you want to manually start an xsession like that, you should rather do something like gnome-session --session=ubuntu. gnome-session will load required components such as gnome-settings-daemon which in turn will configure your stuff. \nSessions are stored in /usr/share/gnome-session/sessions/. You'll see things like \"gnome.session\" and \"ubuntu.session\". You use the file name without the \".session\" extension in the --session parameter. \nLikewise, if you want to properly shut down your desktop session, you can kill that instance of gnome-session. \n\nA: I'm using following method for tty:\ncp ~/.xinitrc ~/.xinitrc.old # if they exist\necho \"exec unity\" > ~/.xinitrc  # or \"exec gnome-session --session=ubuntu\"\nsudo startx -- :1\n\nAnd i have full-featured session Desktop Environment. \nBUT, if you go to another tty, session will be broken.\n", "Q: Fixing GRUB after fresh install from LiveCD on USB I just reinstalled Ubuntu 12.04 using a LiveCD mounted on a USB drive.\nWhen the USB drive isn't plugged in... things won't boot.

Unfortunately, I'm not sure how to go about this.\nWhen booting with the USB stick plugged in, I get a menu that displays the different boot options and I can boot in to either Ubuntu or Windows 7 like I should be able to.\nI also have the LiveCD USB stick listed as the first device accessed during the boot sequence. \nThis thread seems to have a good walkthrough but I'm stuck on the first step.\nWhen running ls, I see:\n(hd0), (hd0,msdos6), (hd0,msdos5), (hd0,msdos3), (hd0,msdos2), I think.

After changing from 32-bit (because of recommendations) to 64-bit Ubuntu, upgrade (12.04 -> 12.10) did not go too well, so clean install was needed. I choose the automatic way for partitions creation (because I have read that swap could be added manually).\nNow I have ended with one partition /dev/sda1 226.3GB (according to System monitor) instead of 250GB.\nWhen I look it up in Disk Utility, I have three volumes: \n\n\n*\n\n*247GB /dev/sda1\n\n*3.2GB extended\n\n*3.2GB swap\n\n\nI have deleted the old kernels from GRUB (only 150MB), checked the logs...\nSo I was wondering, is this problem caused by old versions (12.10 32 bit and 12.10 64-bit) still occupying disk space?\n\nA: You should have about 247-(247*0,05) = 234GB. That's because 5% of the available space is saved for the root user so that you may boot the system and perform tasks. This can be tuned using tune2fs. However, you should remember a couple of things; full file systems get fragmented and slow. Also, if your system file system is all full for some reason, you may run into trouble. The 5% is reserved for those two reasons. \n234GB isn't exactly the same as the 226 that you expected. There might be other issues as well, such as one using GiB instead of GB, etc. \nBut to answer your question, it's not caused by previous installs. \n\nA: The program Disk Utility reports disk size in gigabytes (GB) or 10^9 bytes. The File Systems tab in System Monitor uses gibibyte (GiB) which is 2^30 bytes or approximately 1.074 * 10^9 bytes.\nIn my home machine, Disk Utility reports 34 GB (actually 33.55 GB) and System Monitor reports 30.8 GiB. Converting 33.55 GB gives 33.55/1.074 = 31.2 GiB.  This accounts for most of the difference of the sizes.\nIn your case, your 250 GB disk gives up 3.2 GB for swap and this leaves 246.8 GB or 229.8 GiB for the main partition. I can't be sure about the remaining 3.6 GiB. As Jo-Erlend indicates, some space is reserved for system use and it is possible the two programs count this space differently.\nThe previous answer is correct: The difference is not caused by previous installs.\nSee http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gibibyte for the difference between GB and GiB.\n", "Q: Deleted /usr/include by mistake Like a real idiot, I deleted my \n\n/usr/include\n\non 13.04, is there anyway I can retrieve this?\n\nA: /usr/include contains data about your packages, which means that a fresh install wouldn't write anything to it. I'm afraid your system has suffered a great loss.\nMaybe you could try an update for your packages, but from experience, I know this doesn't usually work with Ubuntu.\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get upgrade\n\nIf your lucky, the apt cache will still have information about packages that used /usr/include. You can find a list using dpkg -S /usr/include/*, and use sudo apt-get reinstall [package] to fix things.\nEdit : Best solution found in the comments :\nsudo apt-get install --reinstall $(dpkg -S /usr/include/*|cut -d':' -f1|tr -d ','|tr '\\n' ' ')\n\nIn order to reinstall all packages that where corrupted.\n\nA: Hi (and thanks for solution), some additional commands used by me:\ndpkg -S /usr/include/*|cut -d':' -f1|tr -d ','|tr '\\n' ' ' > app.list\ncat app.list | tr ' ' '\\n' | sort | uniq > sortapp.list\ncat sortapp.list | tr '\\n' ' ' > sortapp-2.list\nsudo apt update\nsudo apt-get install --reinstall $( cat sortapp-2.list )\n\n", "Q: How would I format a USB drive to be accessible in Windows and OSX? Something with my installation of Windows has gone seriously wrong, so I was looking to reinstall Windows 7. However, since I don't have an optical drive on my machine, I was attempting to make a bootable USB drive. The most preferable option would be to use the tool provided by Microsoft, but of course that only works on Windows. I was playing around with some alternative tools to create an install thumbdrive such as WinUSB and UNetbootin, which involved a lot of messing around in gparted as I tried and failed to boot from the USB drive.\nEventually I decided to just create a Windows VM in VirtualBox and utilize Microsoft's own software, except now Windows won't recognize my thumbdrive; I'm getting a fairly generic \"Code 10\" error when I try to inspect the drive in the device manager. I also tried using it on my Mac, but it won't recognize the device either.\nOrdinarily I'd assume that I massively corrupted the drive in some capacity, but I still am able to use it without issue on Ubuntu, so I'm assuming I can still salvage it in some way? I've tried formatting it in FAT/32, NTFS, leaving the space unformatted, etc, but the other OSes still refuse to read it.\nAny suggestions on how I can regain access to my thumbdrive on Windows and Mac?\n\nA: Note : I'm a terminal guy. You could do the following (finding partitions, reformating) using gParted (GUI). By the way, this will erase all data on your key.\nFirst, find the device file to your USB drive. Under Ubuntu, you'll find it using the Disk Utility, which can be found using the Dash. (once opened, click on your key, and find it's device in /dev ; it will probably be something like /dev/sdb).\nOnce you have it, and once you're sure about it, type :\nsudo fdisk /dev/X\n\nX being what you found earlier.\nPress p to find the link to your USB partition (it will begin with /dev/X and end with a number ; probably something like /dev/sdb1). Remember it, we'll call this new name Y.\nUse w to write changes (none actually...) and quit.\nBack in the command line, type :\nsudo mkfs.msdos -F 32 /dev/Y\n\nRemember, Y is /dev/* ending with a number (partition link). This will format the key in FAT32.\nOnce formatting is finished, your clear to go. Unplug/Replug the USB drive to force Ubuntu to remount it.\nIn the end, if you need a bootable USB drive, use Unetbootin, which is available under Linux. It only requires an ISO image.\n", "Q: Running Magic the Gathering Online Beta? Has anyone been able to run Magic the Gathering Online beta in Linux?

I just completed an installation that I've encrypted my home directory on, and got the dialog box inviting me to record my encryption passphrase. I don't see any possible benefit to doing this; if I need to recover my data from outside this Ubuntu installation, I can do so by unwrapping the passphrase with my login password (in fact, I just did this after my last installation died on me). On the other hand, anyone who gained access to the encryption passphrase would be able to use it to decrypt my data.\nIs there any good reason to record the passphrase?\n\nA: The passphrase unwrapper unwraps from a file stored on your system, likely in /home/.ecryptfs. It's just prudent to have another, off-system copy of this single point of failure for all your user data.\n", "Q: Email Alert on SSH and SFTP Connection Looked through other questions about email alerts on login but have 2 questions:\nCan the alert be triggered by users connecting via SFTP as well? (I tried this before and it only triggered an email when using SSH and not using SFTP for remotely transferring)\nThe other answers said that an email alert wont work when the -n switch is used via SSH, is there a way around this?\nThanks.\n\nA: Basically, I would use something in .bashrc to trigger the mail sending command. With includes and permissions tricks, you could make it impossible to edit for the user (give .bashrc to root, make it include .bashrc_priv, which you give to the user for his own configuration).\n.bashrc, belongs to root\n# trigger mail here\n[ -f \"~/.bashrc_priv\" ] && . ~/.bashrc_priv\n\n.bashrc_priv, belongs to $USER\n# Whatever you want in your users' bashrc ; they can edit this file.\n\nAs I recall, SFTP triggers the bash login process.\nIf you're using something in particular to trigger the alert (some package/application), let me know.\n\nA: You can set this up with rsyslog, which you are probably running. It includes an output module to send an email, and you can set up a rule to email a certain address when a logged message is matched. Here's an example:\n$ModLoad ommail\n$ActionMailSMTPServer mail.example.net\n$ActionMailFrom example@example.net\n$ActionMailTo example@example.net\n$template mailSubject,\"User logged into %hostname%\"\n$template mailBody,\"RSYSLOG Alert\\r\\nmsg='%msg%'\"\n$ActionMailSubject mailSubject\n$ActionExecOnlyOnceEveryInterval 60\nif $msg contains 'session opened for user' then :ommail:;mailBody\n\nYou can drop that in /etc/rsyslog.d/notify.conf, customize it as necessary, then run service rsyslog restart. You should receive emails that look like:\nDate: Mon, 15 Jul 2013  2:30:01 UT\nFrom: <example@example.net>\nTo: <example@example.net>\nSubject: User logged into localhost\nX-Mailer: rsyslog-immail\n\nRSYSLOG Alert\nmsg=' pam_unix(cron:session): session opened for user root by (uid=0)'\n\nYou can read more about this functionality at: http://www.rsyslog.com/doc/ommail.html\n", "Q: lookup algorithm for finding a shell command In my example, I am going to use the shell command \"rake\".\nWhat is the lookup sequence Ubuntu uses to find what to do when rake is invoked? e.g. does it look for a path specified in .bash_profile, does it look some place else, etc.\n\nA: I will assume you installed it through rvm.\nAs you said, your PATH is modified by .bashrc or .bash_profile.\nWhat the shell does is very simple, it looks at your command and splits it with the spaces and look for the first word (in you case, rake).\nThen it looks at the PATH environment variable (see its value with echo $PATH) which contains different directories separated by semicolons (:). It splits it with the semicolons and then iterate through every directory to see if there is a file that you have the rights to execute. When it finds it, the shell executes it giving the rest of the words as arguments.\nIn the case of rvm, you should have /home/username/.rvm/rubies/ruby-1.9.3-p374@global/bin in you PATH. It should find an executable called rake which then executes an executable called rake in /home/username/.rvm/gems/ruby-1.9.3-p374@global/gems/rake-10.0.3/bin which run /home/username/.rvm/gems/ruby-1.9.3-p374@global/gems/rake-10.0.3/lib/rake.rb (your version may vary).\n", "Q: After removing a folder (apache2 I think) I'm having PHP and LAMP trouble When I go to phpmyadmin it says: \nThe mysqli extension is missing.

I am fairly new to using avconv, but would like to use it to perform this conversion. \nMy real problem is knowing what settings to use such as the bitrate. Essentially all I want to do is change the format to allow my DVD player to play it. \nIn Windows I would normally use FormatFactory, which essentially allowed me to do a drag and drop conversion with no setting changes required. I essentially am trying to do that same thing in Ubuntu but with the command line. \n\nA: I ended up using the following command, though there may be better solutions:\navconv -i input_movie_name.avi -c copy output_movie_name.mp4\n\nI had to use mp4, as mkv was giving me issues.\n\nA: Look the documentation for avconv. There is a \"target\" option. The safest for playing on a DVD should be to use the \"-target dvd\" option:\nThe problem with \"-target dvd\" is the size of the resulting file.

The  problem comes when I am trying to run boot-repair on the 32 bit version of ubuntu and it complains by saying that I need to have a 64-bit version of ubuntu to support the efi system.When I try to download the 64 bit version on my computer, the archive manager stops and claims that there is an error, how do I work around this. \n\nA: As Rod said, a 64-bit installation is optimal nowadays, especially on systems with Windows 8, where there is an extra layer of protection with the UEFI.\nJust download the 64-bit ISO and re-install Ubuntu. Quickest solution IMO.\n\nA: Download errors have nothing to do with the firmware or CPU architecture. They're more likely related to network errors, running out of disk space, or other such problems. Reporting the precise error you get when you download the 64-bit would be helpful. So would telling us how you're trying to do it (clicking a link in a Web browser, using a torrent, etc.)\nIt is possible to run a 32-bit Linux from a 64-bit EFI. If Boot Repair can't handle it, that's a Boot Repair issue. Getting it to work will require an understanding of your current setup and knowledge of EFI boot loaders for Linux generally (or your specific boot loader in particular). Since you haven't said how your boot process is failing, it's hard to offer specific suggestions on fixing it.\nThat said, running a 32-bit Linux on a 64-bit EFI is sub-optimal, so upgrading to a 64-bit installation is definitely the preferred way to go.\n", "Q: Simple port forwarding I am in a bit of trouble as I am trying to setup a reverse proxy with and a second server.

If you run this command and have trouble with it, replace the -A flag with -D to remove it.\nIf you're looking to have this rule run automatically when 10.0.0.132 starts up, consider adding the above command as a \"post-up\" rule in /etc/network/interfaces.\n\nA: In case someone else is looking for a way that actually works.

In optimus configuration the nvdia hardware isn't connected to the output screen. Only the inbuilt graphics card is attached with the screen. So the OS never detects that there is an nvidia graphics device. (Even windows doesn't detect that, nvidia drivers installed in windows tells windows that the device is an nvdia graphics card. Try running the system rating utility in windows, the score will be always based on the internal graphics card)\nThen how it works, in windows whenever the nvidia driver detects a directx call, cuda call it starts the nvidia hardware. The information is passed to nvidia card, nvidia card decode and generate the images and pass then to internal grphaics card for displaying.\nSo at the end, you will never see nvidia card listed in system details, it should list the internal graphics card\nWhat does bumblebee do - If you didn't install it, in linux both graphics card stays on always leading to high temperature and battery usage and nvidia card never used as the OS doesn't know how to use it. By installing it, it disables the nvidia card, and when you required you can use the nvidia card to some extent (not fully). And it also install the nvidia driver required.\nNever install driver from nvidia site for an optimus system. If you go to Addtional Details / Support tab of the download page. It is clearly written This driver doesn't support some models of the graphics card. More specifically, those driver doesn't support optimus configuration. \nInstalling mesa-utils is enough for detecting the internal graphics driver (mostly the internal gpu is made by intel). At this moment, I think you system is in pretty much mess. I suggest to start with a new installation. Install all updates and bumblebee. Test bumbleebee with optirun. If this works don't worry about what is shown in system details. \n", "Q: Trying to undo some commands I have done the following commands trying to make Ubuntu work faster:\necho 100 > /proc/sys/vm/overcommit_ratio\necho 2 > /proc/sys/vm/overcommit_memory\n\n#/etc/sysctl.conf прописываем:\nvm.overcommit_memory=2\nvm.overcommit_ratio=100\n\nIt's become worse.

Do I need to run only those 2 command to get GUI for Ubuntu Server?\nThanks a lot!\n\nA: Your dilemma is similar to situations I have faced. I wanted to set up a server that could double as a desktop machine, and I had other machines that would function exclusively as desktops.\nThe server was an IBM system x3400 m3. I tried installing a number of desktop and server distros, including CentOS 6, Debian 6, Linux Mint 13, and others. The only one that worked was Ubuntu Server 12.04. I installed it and then installed the desktop followed by KDE. It has been running for months with no problems whatsoever.\nFor my desktop machines, I settled on Linux Mint 13 LTS with KDE. Here again, the machines have been running flawlessly for months.\nRecently, I tested or retested several other distros, including CentOS 6.5, Debian 7.2, Mageia 3, OpenSUSE 13.1, and PClinuxOS 2013. My criteria included ease of use, aesthetics, and ability to run some graphics-intensive modeling programs that require openGL. From this group, I was most favorably impressed by CentOS and PClinuxOS. However, all of the distros fell short of Ubuntu and Linux Mint, and so I am staying with Ubuntu server for my server and Linux Mint for my desktops. \nAlthough I favor Mint for my desktops, I could also be satisfied using Ubuntu with KDE.\n\nA: I run a 4 server/2 desktop environment, my hardware is a little dated and this is my configuration:  \nServers: \n   Ubuntu Server /w Kubuntu Desktop Installed (for remote ssh use) 12.04 LTS (x64)\n   All Machines have Dual CPUs, each a Intel Core2 Duo 3.2Ghz -ish\n   Each has about 80GB SCSI hard disk space, ranging from 2-6GB of ram\n   Graphics Built-on Crappy Radeon 1st generation originally for windows 2003\n   No Sound, but I installed the ALSA PC-Speaker PCM device and get sound that way (works good, and it's pretty loud)\n   Network Interfaces are all at 1 GigaBit (dual) and are using the Bus-Wired-Bus \n   style of physical  network layout (Ethernet cat5)\n   The first server on the bus is the Web Server (apache 2 + drupal 6) \n   The last 3 are combination local or remote tunnel (ssh -X) workstations\n   They are super-responsive, the website gets about 20-80 connections max at a time\nDesktops:\n   Kubuntu 14.04.1 LTS, note the LTS and the .1 x64\n   Graphics: PCIX Radeon x1950, OpenGL 1.2 only :( but still works good\n   HDD: 500GB Seagate SATA, DVD-RAM/RW   CPU: Dual Core Intel 3.7Ghz x64\n   Sound: SB Audigy2/LiveDrive   Periphrials: Keyboard, Mouse, Joystick\nThe above configuration gives me less than 1-second latency on clicks over ssh (i use 'xinit /usr/bin/ssh -X myhost /usr/bin/startkde -- :1 vt12' to start my session over the network which takes advantage of the server's speed and my local hardware. This is much better for me than vnc or rdp[win]. To keep things running good after setting it all up, there are a few things I keep in mind when using Ubuntu (or any derivative thereof): \n\n\n*\n\n*stick with either the most recent xx.04.1 LTS, so when they released 14.04 LTS, I was still using 12.04.1, because IMO I dont trust a release until it's had some road test time, that goes triple for servers. \n\n*I never use wildcards when using apt-get if I am not TOTALLY sure that it wont bloat the system and make irreversible changes. \n\n*I ALWAYS backup daily, my apt logs for safe keeping  4- I NEVER upgrade my kernel if it works just fine and always make sure I know what the kernel I am installing is intended for (ie, dont just install goldfish that will severely slow your desktop down :)) \n\n*Refrain from compiling software (not installing it unless i MUST, and if I do, make sure it goes to /usr/local, not /usr, and commercial software in /opt) using package manager instead and stick with one package manager (dont mix aptitude and software-center, muon-discover, etc)\n\n*Make sure I take a snapshot of my home directory before major changes   \n\n*always use per-user settings and avoid /etc and such files like the plague if possible (not editing /etc/bash.bashrc instead of ~/.bashrc)  \n\n*Always reboot with M-SYSRQ-(R,E,I)S,U,B if the system hangs  \n\n*Use tftp or sftp instead of nfs  \n\n*dont use mysql server and other heafty daemons unless i really need it (i keep just one on my web server) and finally, \n\n*finally, never enable the root account for login, and do all root commands using sudo and avoid the 'sudo su' command unless i need it bad enough\n\n\nAs far as installing, I ALWAYS install the Ubuntu Server first, then I install a package called 'kubuntu-desktop' and that does the rest. There are meta packages for the others too. I STRONGLY avoid mixing desktop/window managers because they don't play nice alot of the time (like Ubuntu, KDE, Gnome) and this is the same for the compositors (kwin, compiz, etc) \nFor me, this all works great, I've found Ubuntu to not work for me lately (after version 12.10, that is) because of some change does not like my graphics card and has problems, whats worse is with Unity8, which does not work period at this time for me. This may be different for you since you have a better system.\nThis is just my setup, your faster system should scream on that kind of setup since it is so much faster than my desktop system. I am not sure but maybe also try the low-latency kernel however I dont know if it is really that much faster, i only noticed a diff with Ubuntu Studio which uses it by default. (XFCE is pretty fast)\nAs far as Linux Mint is concerned, I had to hack the install disc just to get it to boot up right, and it has issues (at least 17 did) for me.  I have also used Fedora and while it is nice, It is very alien to me (redhat/ubuntu pun intended!! get it?) and I'm too used to [k]ubuntu to switch for now. I can't vouch for the other millions of distros out there. I do know CentOS above is not based on Debian (its redhat) but Mint is basically derivative of ubuntu.\nOf course, using lxde-core is good - personally I have used lxde-common and it has been my best fit, i use chrome as well, but also use firefox sometimes when it gets greedy. I have better luck with the official chrome than i did with chromium browser (it was really slow for me).  \nSo now I hope this helps either you or someone elses question since this was asked little less than a year ago.\n", "Q: error after installing Ubuntu in windows 8 Hello, I am using Acer Aspire 5738.

Are there any negative effects to go into \"suspend mode\" wile an application is in the middle of running?\nI'm assuming applications that don't actually \"do much\" unless interacted with (such as a GEdit or Nautilus window) would handle it fine.\nBut I imagine applications like Transmission or an active cp or mv command which are continuously reading/writing from the harddisk, or sending data over the network may not like it as much. Or are these concerns unfounded?\n\nA: \nAre there any negative effects to go into \"suspend mode\" wile an application is in the middle of running?\n\nNo, an application should be able to cope with this just fine.  If it doesn't, it would indicate a problem with the application.\nAn application doesn't even have to know it suspended, it may just notice the normal side-effects of associated things like active network connections being cut off.\nAn application like Transmission will notice that any network connections it had open suddenly close.  It should just continue to try to open new connections, no harm done.  This is just the same as if your internet connection went down temporarily.\nAn operation like cp or mv should be fine particularly if the operation is on local drives - it should continue after resuming, except in the case that the device it was copying from or to has been disconnected in the mean-time (or was a network device and the connection was lost), in which case it would issue an error message, just as if you had disconnected the device yourself while the computer was running.\nSo to summarise, suspending your computer usually won't harm the running applications any more than the network dropping connection, or changing the time on the clock, or disconnecting devices, might at any time.  An application doesn't need to be specially programmed to be able to suspend and resume properly.\n\nA: Yes, network applications will behave themselves as they were disconnected. Transmission will reconnect automatically. And cp/mv I did not research, but when I start copying in Virtual Machine and suspend then resume it, the operation breaks. I think these commands will do the same thing.\n\nA: Interesting question. For network transmissions, there are timeouts, so those connections will be broken after a certain amount of time. Read and write from a local harddisk should be fine and would just resume when the system comes back up, but I'm not 100% certain and I think I'd try to avoid that situation. \nIt's not possible to talk about commands that way. If you're copying or moving using cp or mv to/from a network mounted file system over TCP, then if you suspend, the network connection is dropped and when the system comes back up, the data source/destination no longer exists. So even if a local cp would be unaffected, in another situation, it would be detrimental. \n", "Q: Has support for non-UEFI/non-I386 been dropped?

Can anyone confirm this conclusion?\n\nNo, all Ubuntu images work fine with general BIOS systems. Really. As you don't include any reference to that \"research\", I don't see how you come to that conclusion.\nAnd while the actual i368 architecture isn't supported anymore, the i686 architecture and up still is (despite keeping the i386 name), next to x86_64 (also referred to as amd64 and this has nothing to do with AMD, just the support for the amd64 instruction set).\nFrom the Ubuntu installation guide:\n\nHowever, Ubuntu precise will not run on i586 or earlier processors. Despite the architecture name \"i386\", support for actual 80386 processors (and their clones) was dropped with the Sarge (r3.1) release of Debian[2]. (No version of Linux has ever supported the 286 or earlier chips in the series.)

Say there is a ready-to-use ubuntu private cloud infrastructure using MAAS, juju and OpenStack. The next step for a newbie developer is trying to write an application upon this infrastructure as a service. But I found only small documentation about how to write Charms rather than a cloud-specialized application! As I know, Charms are only about applications deployment using juju but I need to know how to write the application itself. I'm worry about:\n\n\n*\n\n*How a cloud-application is different from a typical traditional application?\n\n*How should I enable scalability for my application in both processing and storage using other 3rd parties softwares as a services (SaaS)?\n\n*What are ubuntu's tools, IDEs, SDKs and etc to write a cloud-specific application?\n\n\nThanks in advance!\n\nA: Your question is very broad, but I'll try to answer it the best I can. Ubuntu provides you an OpenStack cloud, this handles your infrastructure. As far as how you're going to write your application on top of the cloud is really up to you. \nSince AWS is a popular cloud here are some architecture documents that you can scan that give you an idea on how to design your infrastructure for a certain need. Though these apply to AWS and use AWS-specific services you can easily adapt it for OpenStack or any other cloud. \n\nIn this example AWS shows how to design a web application at scale. Applying this to your infrastructure OpenStack provides the ability to set this up, and Juju would deploy the services you need. So moving from front to back Juju would provide you a load balancer (by deploying HAProxy) your webservers (Depending on what technology you use, lets assume nginx), more load balancers (HAProxy), your application servers (depending on what technology you use, let's say a Rails app), and then your databases (pick one). \nUbuntu provides the means for you to deploy and run these services, and Juju provides a way to manage and orchestrate them. As far as to how to write a cloud application, people have written entire books on the subject so you might be better off starting with one of them. \nSee also:\n\n\n*\n\n*http://www.infoworld.com/d/cloud-computing/developing-cloud-apps-whats-different-675?page=0,0\n\n*https://stackoverflow.com/questions/8244328/openstack-hello-world\n", "Q: resolution problem in 12.04 i am using i3 Hello I am using i3processor3.2 speed and asus p8 H61-M LX3 R2.0 mother board, I am getting low resolution can any one please say how i can clear that problem \n\nA: Try to change the graphic card driver.\nOpen Ubuntu Software Center -> Software packages -> Extra drivers (I think)\n", "Q: Removing win8 ubuntu dual-boot and using just ubuntu I just bought an asus notebook.

I installed it in uefi mode too using the guide at: http://www.linuxbsdos.com/2012/11/05/dual-boot-windows-8-and-ubuntu-12-10-on-uefi-hardware/\nI have gone as far as running boot-repair on my installed ubuntu, and have not used the EasyBCD part. I can now dual-boot ubuntu and win8 with no problems using GRUB2.\nMy question is the following: if I want to remove the dual-boot setup and install just ubuntu, can I use the ubuntu liveCD and choose the erase disk option? I know this will remove all my data, but that is allright. My fear is ending up with an unbootable machine. Can that happen?\n\nA: Yes, you could have a data loss.\nYou should make a backup of the full disk with something like clonezilla. \nAfter that you should try to enlarge your linux partitions with Parted Magic.\nMaybe you could make the backup with Parted Magic too because it contains already clonezilla.\n\nA: I fear an issue may ocurr when you try to format the Window's 8 and run straight Ubuntu. I had the same problem with my laptop, and I was faced with an error message saying there was no boot device. \nI have tried multiple Linux versions to no avail. From what I gather, Window's 8 either locks down the master boot file once installed, or stores it on 'an invisible' sector, that isn't readable/format-able unless the HDD/SSD is completely removed and completed. I am sure some IT professional will jump on here and edit this comment, as it may be wrong.\nFrom what I have read, there are some known issues with the MBR. If you are looking for a decent guide to fix this problem, then I can point you in this direction. I gather (and this is a good way to confirm), if you place your live USB/CD in after the install and go 'Try', re-installing the OS will come up with the previous install. I know alot of the more knowledgeable folks around here can go into some detail, but a suggestion that is always thrown up is to repair your grub. There are some guides over on my question, or a link here (probably easier)\nSadly I am unable to just add a comment on here, because my reputation is too low.

There's no difference between Ubuntu Server and Ubuntu Desktop except the default packages. That is, you can install all services on Ubuntu Desktop as well. \n\nA: You could download a Ubuntu 12.04 DVD image1 and assign that as one of the package sources. Based on this answer to another question (edited quote): \n\nmkdir /media/mountpoint  \nmount -t iso9660 -o loop /pathtoiso.iso /media/mountpoint  \n\nthen add a line\ndeb file:///media/mountpoint distro main restricted universe multiverse\n\nto a new file in the sources lists, e.g.: /etc/sources.list.d/myubuntu1204dvd.list\n\nThe last part in one command that is\necho \"deb file:///media/mountpoint distro main restricted universe multiverse\" | \\\n     sudo tee /etc/sources.list.d/myubuntu1204dvd.list\n\nThen run\nsudo apt-get update\n\nand install the regular GUI:\nsudo apt-get install ubuntu-desktop^\n\n(The caret is not a typo, it is used for APT tasks.)\nAnd it's always a good idea to check for the latest point release of an LTS version. At the time of writing 12.04.2 is available as ISO CDROM and DVD images. You could use the CDROM, but the DVD contains a lot more packages.\n1 Yes, DVD, not CDROM. Those images are not mirrored to all mirrors, so be careful in that.

Thank you in advance!\nBest regards,\nAleksandar C.\n\nA: OK, so this is not a real answer, because many things could have gone wrong, but maybe it will help you, and it is too long for a comment. First thing; since your mouse works, you should go to the system settings / keyboard and try to select again your default keyboard. Also, you should attempt to check the keyboard there.\nWhat happened to me a few times was that during upgrade, several of the config files in ~/ did not work or did not work properly. Sometimes it was just too much of a bother to really track down the problem. If that was the case, I did the following (assume that the username is 'foo'):\n\n\n*\n\n*Log in to a text terminal (ctrl-alt-f1)\n\n*Become root with sudo -i\n\n*Move the old home to a temp directory\nmv /home/foo /home/foo-backup\n\n\n*Create a new home\nmkdir /home/foo\nfind /etc/skel/ -exec cp {} . \\;\nchown -R foo:foo /home/foo\n\n\n*Log in again through the GUI.

They run Ubuntu 13.04 and manually assembled Linux respectively. \nIs there a way to prevent them from being shut down on pressing Shutdown button (on case, not on keyboard)? Sure, I can do it in hardware. I just prefer software solutions. \nIf somebody can say for sure \"this is impossible\" it would be a useful answer too. \nResult: Ok, I understood it.

Done  \nBuilding dependency tree        \nReading state information... Done  \nE: Unable to locate package linux-kernel-devel  \n\nI have tried the following:\nsudo apt-get install linux-headers-$(uname -r)  \nsudo apt-get install build-essentials  \nsudo apt-get install Linux-headers-generic \n\nwith no joy... any suggestions?\n\nA: Executive Summary\nYou probably want to install the package called linux-headers-generic.\nIf running uname -r gives you something other than generic after the version number, substitute that for generic in linux-headers-generic. (This might be server or generic-pae on some installations of some Ubuntu releases, and there are a few other occasional kernel \"flavors.\")\nSince you most likely needs this so that you can build a driver (which might be automated, you might not be \"building it yourself\"), it's a good idea to install build-essential too to make it so you'll probably have all the necessary tools.\nFull Explanation\nTo the best of my knowledge, no operating system has a package called Linux-kernel-devel. This is for two reasons:\n\n*\n\n*Package names starting with capital letters are extremely rare, for any Unix-like OS.\n\n*GNU/Linux operating systems typically name their kernel-related packages so that the names contain the word kernel or the word linux, but not both. (On Ubuntu, it's the word linux.)\n\nIt's common for kernel-related packages on systems that use the Red Hat Package Manager (rpm) and related utilities to have kernel in the name of their packages. For example, Mageia has a number of packages whose names start with kernel and end in devel. These packages almost always (on Mageia and any OS that has them) provide the header files needed to build drivers from source for use with the kernel. They may also provide related utilities to facilitate. These packages:\n\n*\n\n*do not provide the full source code of the kernel. That's provided by other packages.\n\n*do not provide a pre-compiled, usable kernel. That's provided by other packages.\n\n*do not provide a compiler or most other purpose build tools. Those, too, are provided by other packages.\n\nIn Ubuntu, as can be seen in the list here, the packages that provide kernel headers have names that start with linux-headers. Usually the correct package to install is linux-headers-generic. However, to be sure of what package to install to get headers that correspond to your currently running kernel, run:\nuname -r\n\nYou'll get output that looks something like:\n3.5.0-36-generic\n\nThat is, you'll have a version number (which will include . characters and usually at least one -), followed by a -, followed by one or more words indicating which kind of kernel you are running.\nIf you just want the headers for the specific version you happen to be running now, you could install the package whose name is linux-headers-* where * is replaced by the full output of uname -r. For example, on my system, I could run:\nsudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install linux-headers-3.5.0-36-generic\n\nI could even automate it:\nsudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install linux-headers-`uname -r`\n\nThese approaches are equivalent, but they are not usually the best way to go.\nInstead, you usually will want to install the metapackage that always provides the newest kernel headers as an update (by perpetually depending on whatever header package is newest). This parallels the way your compiled, running kernel is installed and gets updated. To do that, look just at the part of uname -r's output after the version number. That is, if uname -r gives you 3.5.0-36-generic, take just the generic part.\nThen install the package called linux-headers-* where * is replaced by that part. So, on my system, it would be linux-headers-generic and one way I could install it would be to run:\nsudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install linux-headers-generic\n\nFor most people it is linux-headers-generic, but depending on what Ubuntu release you're running, what architecture and type of device you're running it on, and how it is installed and configured, other possibilities include generic-pae, highbank, omap, server, and virtual.\nRelated Packages\nHeader files facilitate developing and compiling/building software that uses facilities provided by the software whose header files are being used. The most common reason you might need kernel headers is if you are going to build a driver (a kernel module) from source code. Some applications, like VMware and VirtualBox, will sometimes require this, and will automate the build themselves.\nIn addition to header files, to build software a compiler and other tools are needed. To maximize the likelihood that you have the necessary tools, it's a good idea to install the build-essential package also.\nIt's uncommon for anyone to need the actual full kernel source code (unless, of course, you're planning on building your kernel from source). But if you do need that, you'll have to install another package too. In Ubuntu the package for full kernel source code is called linux-source. (This is in keeping with the Debian/Ubuntu convention of naming packages that provide substantive parts of the Linux kernel linux rather than kernel.)\nIf You Still Have Trouble\nIf you try to install any of these packages but experience problems, and you want help, then you will have to include the complete and exact text from the Terminal, including the lines where you typed commands. The best way to provide this is by editing your question, but if it is too long, you can paste it somewhere like http://paste.ubuntu.com and provide us with the URL where we can access it.\nIf you comment on this question, I'll be notified. You can edit your question and also comment here to call attention to the information you've provided in your question. (Important information is best kept in questions and answers.) Good luck!\n\nA: As the report said (E: Unable to locate package linux-kernel-devel) \nThere are no packages like that. \nYou can install every kernel version you want by downloading the debian kernel packages from here\nFor example; we want to install kernel 3.9.8 (i386 architecture);\nDownload all **i386.deb packages And also ***all.deb package to a folder.\nGet in to the folder with cd command in terminal;\nsudo dpkg -i *.deb\nsudo update-grub2\nsudo reboot\n\nThis will install the kernel version you want. You can analyse the versions of the kernel mainline and longterm versions in this site\n\nA: You'll have to map out yourself which specific deb's you need, but there is the debs you will need in Ubunut's kernel builds. \nHonestly I'd first check with sudo apt-get update and then sudo apt-get dist-upgrade to make sure your running the latest kernel and won't need to do this again shortly.\nNext look through the kernel build listing for your version that matches your uname -r. You need to look in each builds build.log to find out what head version they are mapping that build to. I have 3.5.0-34#55 listed as my kernel but this really maps out to build 3.5.7.14-quantal. Install all the debs that correspond with that version to get your headers and such, and make sure you've got your build tools with sudo apt-get install build-essential\nYour mileage may very though depending on what you plan to do with the devel files.\n\nA: linux-kernel-devel is the name of a SUSE/Redhat package providing things like genksyms.\nA very quick Google suggests that linux-headers-generic provides genksyms on Debian/Ubuntu.\n", "Q: Bad color of backgroundColor in a MainView when fixed to \"#F1E1A3\" I have a strange problem.

I am new to to Ubuntu and I wanna learn UNIX/Linux commands. For that which Ubuntu version is better to install desktop or server?\nCan I install server within Windows OS? Or try by live CD mode?\n\nA: The difference is mostly in getting a graphical environment extra. All versions have a terminal you can start with.\nThe advantage of 'server' would be that you will not be tempted to do anything with the graphical interface, as you have none. This is when you really have no discipline :)\nThe advantage of the desktop (or live) CD, would be you can use a browser to find yourself some hints/howtos.\nIn the end you can do anything you want in the command line on both types. For desktop you can either use ctrl-alt-T to get a terminal window, or use ctrl-alt-f1.\n\nA: If you are only interested in learning how to use the command line, then the Desktop version is all you need. Once installed, login and type Ctrl-Alt-T to open a terminal.\n\nA: You better install the graphical version, but take care of using mainly command line and console tools. Learn the complete basic unix-like tools like ls, cat, grep, man, less, top, etc. You must practice the full basic stack, and man will be your best friend. \nA local ssh server can be interesting too, to practice before getting connected to a distant server, your local desktop machine can be transformed to a server.\nLearn how to use console editors like Vim or Emacs.\nFor more ease of use I recommend strongly to take a look at a Terminal Multuplexer like GNU Screen or Tmux.\n\nA: Virtualize your Ubuntu\nIf it is only for learning terminal commands you may want to consider installing Ubuntu in a virtual machine.\nParallel OS\nYou might not need a graphical desktop as you will have full access to your host Windows for surfing, looking up tutorials, printing etc.. Most virtual machines even have an implementation for a bidirectional clipboard to further ease things. Both operating systems will run in parallel.\nNo performance drop from graphics\nThe server edition will give you a more genuine Unix-like experience, and you will not suffer from performance drops due to heavily demanding graphics (which is an issue in all virtual machine applications).\nNetworking included\nIn addition your virtual machine can be connected to the host OS very much then same we would do on a real network. This gives you freedom for networking, and server application experiments.\nSnapshots\nBut most importantly you will have the invaluable option to make snapshots of your machine before you do possibly destructive experiments on your virtual machine. Your previous installation then is only a mouse-click away in case you messed things up.\nCross platform\nChoose a cross platform vitualization software (e.g. Virtual Box, VMWare) to be able to carry your VM on a pen drive to wherever you want it to be.\nSadly no Unity\nThe only disadvantage I can think of when running Ubuntu server in a virtual machine is the lack of Unity desktop experience.\n", "Q: Installing NVIDIA GeForce GTX 560 on Ubuntu 13.04 I have a NVIDIA GeForce GTX 560 graphic card with Ubuntu 13.04 running kernel 3.8.0-19 (tried with 3.10.0-999, same issue) and whenever i tried to install NVIDIA driver, either by downloading the *.run file from http://www.nvidia.com and installing it as root (during installation it give some errors as it failed to set runlevel), or doing those following steps:\nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:xorg-edgers/ppa\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get install nvidia-current nvidia-settings\n\nWhenever I reboot the system, all my screen is messed up (with lower resoluition that should be, and with left and top bars missing), and worked hard to uninstall this driver and get my screen resolution and bars back.

I just downloaded Ubuntu 13.04 earlier and was trying it out.  At least I know you can surf all installed applications with the dash home if you click the icons at the bottom, you're not forced to memorize all the names of everything.\nAnyway...\nI'm used to Windows, where programs have their own ways of storing passwords--and they do, and I've never had a hard time.  It makes me comfortable.  I'm very *un*comfortable with the idea of something storing pretty much ALL my passwords, I prefer them to be separate entities.\nIs a keyring really necessary for programs like Chrome and Firefox?  Can I just disable the keyring altogether and still have Chrome remember my passwords, or when I use Ubuntu, will I forever have to type a password for it to automatically type a password?  To me, typing a password so I don't have to type a password just doesn't make any sense.\nI'm confused.  I never remember having to do this when I installed Linux before.\nAnd yes, I have the login password the same as the keyring password but I still have to log into both each time.\n\nA: Why is necessary?\n\nGNOME Keyring is a daemon application designed to take care of the\nuser's security credentials, such as user names and passwords. The\nsensitive data is encrypted and stored in a keyring file in the user's\nhome folder. The default keyring uses the login password for\nencryption, so users don't need to remember yet another password.\n\nSource: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GNOME_Keyring.\nHow to disable?\nYou can use next command in terminal:\nsudo chmod -x /usr/bin/gnome-keyring\n\nAfter this, Chrome, Firefox and others can still save passwords without the keyring, but these are vulnerable.\nIf you want to re-enable, use +x instead -x in the same command.\n", "Q: cronjob to store home-ip I'm working out a cronjob to store my current ip (home-server) on my external VPS server in a database.\nI can now use the ip to connect to my home server without using DynDNS.\n(OK, probably you think why not just use DynDNS, cause I don't feel safe about someone having my ip in his database every time it changes.)\nIs there any possible way to execute a php file periodically that is on my VPS server to determinate my current ip at home and then store it in a DB?\nThx in advance!\n\nA: Use either wget or curl for this. A crontab entry like this on your home system will do the trick (updating every 30 minutes):\n*/30 * * * * wget -O /dev/null http://your.server.com/ip-logger.php  >/tmp/last-ip.log\n\nUse crontab -e to open an editor with your crontab entries, and add that line at the end. This will discard any output sent by the ip logger server-side script, and log the last console output in /tmp/last-ip.log, in case you need to debug something.\nServer-side, your PHP script needs to look at $_SERVER['REMOTE_ADDR'] and log that into your database.

You'll see the drivers to install. Just install them.\n\nA: For most systems, you shouldn't have to use the command line to install wireless drivers, you should only need to do this if your wireless card is not supported or there is some unexpected issue.\nAs mentioned in another answer, you should be able to go to Open System Settings -> Software & Updates -> Additional Drivers, and there should be the option to install the wireless drivers for your system.\nThis is the recommended action, however if you're unlucky the option may not be there or it may still not work after you've installed it. If this is the case, then you'll have to resort to installing a driver manually. We can offer help with this though, we just need to have some more specific information, for example what wireless card you are using and what version of Ubuntu you are running.\nTo find out what wireless card you have (as per these instructions):\n\n\n*\n\n*Open up the command line by pressing CTRL + ALT+T\n\n*Type lspci -v (or lsusb if you're using a wireless card connecting via USB). You should get a list of information. Look for entries mentioning 'wireless' - this should tell you the make and model of your wireless card.\nNow you're equipped with that knowledge, a quick search via Google or this site will normally provide you with information on installing the appropriate drivers. If you get stuck at this stage (either from lack of information or confusing instructions etc) then I suggest you edit your original question with details of your wireless card, or maybe even delete this question and re-ask a more specific one.\n", "Q: How to install Windows 7 from DVD?

It was suggested it may have been the server edition. When I tried to re-install the proper edition, the installer did not detect windows 7 on my disk. Ubuntu is now installed on a separate partition.

If that fails, it may be necessary to create a custom Windows entry in /etc/grub.d/40_custom and re-running update-grub.\n\nEDIT: The 40_custom entry would look something like this:\nmenuentry \"Windows 7 (loader) (on /dev/sda3)\" --class windows --class os {\n    insmod part_msdos\n    insmod ntfs\n    set root='(hd0,msdos3)'\n    chainloader +1\n}\n\nIf that doesn't work, then it's conceivable it could still be rescued with some sort of tweak (but I can't help beyond this point); or you might have a more fundamental problem, like missing boot loader code in the NTFS partition itself.\n", "Q: I'm new to Ubuntu, and I'd like to know how the Firefox browser really works. Strange, after Windows System(s).... Browsing with Firefox from the Ubuntu is very strange, especially the search bar.\nIs it the only option, or I can create something different?\n\nA: If you prefer, you don't need to use the search text field. If you just type in the address bar what you are looking for and press enter, if it doesn't appear to be an URL firefox will search using the default search engine (should be google, but you can customize it). \nIf you want to adjust the look and feel of firefox, just right click on a toolbar and select customize. For instance, you can remove the search field, if you prefer.\nIf you need any function that firefox does not come with, check out http://addons.mozilla.org - you can customize firefox in many ways, and it should be possible to get it very close to the look and feel you prefer.\nIf you don't like firefox, there are many alternative browsers available in the Ubuntu software repositories. One of them is chromium-browser, which is Google Chrome, without the non-free components. Another option is the Gnome Webbrowser, which is named epiphany-browser. Further alternatives are Midori, rekonq, konqueror, arora, dooble,...\nIf you add a custom software repository, you can also easily install Opera Web Browser.\nIn case you have bad eyes, use a Braille terminal, or simply prefer a clean and high contrast display of web pages, there are text based browsers available, the most prominent ones are lynx, elinks and links. Graphical browsers which are small and fast, but have limited functionality are chimera2, netsurf and dillo.\n", "Q: Unable to connect Galaxy Nexus to Ubuntu 12.04 through gMTP When I launch gMTP for browsing the files in Galaxy Nexus I get the following error message:\n\nFailed to get storage parameters from the device - need to disconnect.\n\nI have already tried the answers given in the following question:\n\n\n*\n\n*Getting MTP enabled devices to work with Ubuntu?\n\nA: If you just want to be able to browse files on your Android phone in 12.04, you can just use the suggested PPA in this good article\nhttp://www.webupd8.org/2013/01/upgrade-to-gvfs-with-mtp-support-in.html\nI personally find it slightly unstable compared to ubuntu 13.04's support, but may be I am nitpicking and overall it works just fine :)\n\nA: The most reliable method for me has been to use go-mtpfs.

I started apt-get dist-upgrade, and it says it wants to upgrade Postgres.  I cancelled, but will it wipe out my database and settings?  I know, \"backup\" and I have, but I still prefer not to set it up again if I can avoid it.\n\nA: No, it shouldn't overwrite any databases. As for the settings, the new package may have updated settings files (eg. for a new default value or a completely new setting) but it should always ask you for a confirmation about overwriting the settings. That dialogue will also have an option to compare the new and old settings file and an option to keep the old settings. Since you have a backup, it is safe to install the update.\n\nA: It will not wipe out your database or settings.\nBut there is a chance that you will run into Debian bug #714725, which will cause your old server package to be uninstalled, leaving you unable to access your data.  For example, if you now have postgresql-8.4 installed and the upgrade proposes to install postgresql-9.1, the old 8.4 instance should just keep on running.  But it's possible that apt-get dist-upgrade decides to uninstall the postgresql-8.4 package, which wouldn't be good.  So be sure to read the output of apt-get dist-upgrade about what it proposes to do.  If you don't like what it proposes to remove, run something like apt-get install postgresql-8.4 to mark the package(s) as manually installed.\n", "Q: How to reset external display? So I was testing my laptop on my external scree and managed to cycle through the modes until I hit the one which displayed only on the external monitor.\nThis just output a green screen and nothing else. Now, whenever I connect the laptop I can't use the fn+f3 button to swap between screen modes. It appears that it's stuck on this output.\nAlso to make things worse, the laptop seems to remember the setting, so now whenever I plugin the display all I ever get is a green screen. I've tried rebooting the laptop, but I  think the only way now is to reset the laptop somehow so it doesn't know that it's been connected to the external screen and I can use 'span' or 'mirror' mode instead of 'external only' mode, which clearly doesn't work.\nUpdate\nI've tried swapping to terminal using CTRL+ALT+F1 but the external display goes to sleep.\nI've tried using microDisplayPort -> HDMI -> DVI to the monitor with the same outcome.\nIt works fine on my TV using HDMI, but I haven't tried cycling the modes.\nI got it working on the TV, and then moved the laptop to the monitor hoping it would work, but I had the same outcome.\nI believe there is a setting somewhere in the system which is remembering the last used configuration for the specific monitor, and I would like to reset that, so that I can at least use my screen in span mode.\n\nA: Clearly you can't see what's happening on screen when this is the case, right? If so, this is a bit of a long shot, but try punching in CTRL+ALT+F1, then type in your username, enter, your password, enter, and then try\nxrandr --output LVDS1 --primary\n\nMaybe that'll work. If not, your display probably isn't called LVDS1, in which case, disconnect from the external display and do:\nxrandr -q\n\nthen replace 'LVDS1' above with whatever that command says your display is. It'll give you something along the lines of:\nScreen 0: minimum 320 x 200, current 1024 x 768, maximum 1920 x 1080\nLVDS connected 1280x800+0+0 (normal left inverted right) 304mm x 228mm\n...\n\nin which case, 'LVDS' is what you should use instead of 'LVDS1'.\nHope that helps.\n\nA: I'm still not sure how I got this to work, but I'll document the process in case anyone else has this same issue.\n\n\n*\n\n*Firstly I turned the laptop off\n\n*Connect the display\n\n*Turn on the laptop\n\n*First time around this gave me a green screen again\n\n*Press (in my case fnc+f1) to cycle the displays once\n\n*This got me back to mirror mode\n\n\nFrom mirror mode I could then use the display control panel to configure my displays into span, rather than just external.\nEven though my Dell 2407WFP has a native resolution of 1920x1200 it seems that I can only output to it at 1680x1050.

The install seemed to go well, I selected the hard drive that I wanted to install it to, ex4 partition and a swap partition and selected this same drive as the boot drive.\nInstall finished and all seemed to be working well, was in the GUI etc. So I powered down and removed the USB stick.\nBooted up again and got to a black screen with a flashing cursor up in the top left corner and it didn't go past this point.\nDidn't see any grub menu either prior to this point - not sure if I should as it's not dual boot?\nSo turned off again, put USB stick back in. It booted off the USB stick and asked if I wanted to install or try ubuntu.

Accidental deletion of ports.conf I have Ubuntu 12.04 and tried to install Apache/PHP/MySQL with the \ndefault LAMP stack using tasksel. \nEverything went well until I was going to edit the /etc/apache2/ports.conf file according to the ApacheMySQLPHP guide. I unintentionally deleted the contents of the document because I had not first changed the file's permissions. \nNow, I cannot figure out how to restore the file to its original state. \nI tried reinstalling the programs, but it had no effect, as Apache is still installed and running.\n\nA: In general, I'd use the apt-file command (needs to be installed) to search for /etc/apache2/ports.conf: apt-file search ports.conf. This will provide a list of packages, one being apache2.2-common. So now you know which package provides the file you're looking to replace. Then you can either reinstall that package or download it and look at its content manually. \nThere might be better ways to accomplish it, but in general, this approach would always lead you in the right direction, at the very least. \n", "Q: Installed Ubuntu 12.04, Wireless connected but no internet eth0      Link encap:Ethernet  HWaddr 00:23:54:bd:2a:dd  \n          UP BROADCAST MULTICAST

How well it works depends on the condition, make and model of your battery and laptop. \nBumblebee does provide other functionality that is not built-in, as many laptops don't have the hardware that it manages.\nTLP can be problematic and needs a lot of custom configuration.

You should place them in ~/.profile instead of ~/.bashrc.\nNOTE: Make sure you don't have ~/.bash_profile otherwise ~/.profile will NOT be loaded by bash.

I am trying to backup my home directory using rsync, and I want to exclude some of the directories that contain junk.  I want to specifically exclude /home/ben/.ccache and /home/ben/build.  Unfortunately the documentation for rsync was information overload and didn't answer my question.  This is what I tried:\nrsync -arv --exclude \"/home/ben/.ccache:/home/ben/build\" /home/ben /media/ben/thumbdrive/\n\nWhat is the right way to do this?\n\nA: To exclude multiple directories you just use multiple --exclude=path switches. So the command from the question properly written is as follows:\nrsync -arv --exclude=.ccache --exclude=build /home/ben /media/ben/thumbdrive/\n\nNote: Use relative paths with exclude. The paths are relative to the source directory, here /home/ben.\n\nA: When having multiple directories and/or files to exclude, make a text file and use the --exclude-from switch. Make a file called exclude_me.txt and in it list your exclusions.\nExample (/home/ben/exclude_me.txt):\n.ccache\nbuild\n.java\n.gvfs\n.xsession-errors\n\nThen your rsync would look something like this:\nrsync -arv --exclude-from='/home/ben/exclude_me.txt' /home/ben /media/ben/thumbdrive/\n\nThis is some information on filter rules that may help:\n\n\n*\n\n*/dir/ means exclude the root folder /dir\n\n*/dir/* means get the root folder /dir but not the contents\n\n*dir/ means exclude any folder anywhere where the name contains dir/\n\n*Examples excluded: /dir/, /usr/share/directory/, /var/spool/dir/\n/var/spool/lpd/cf means skip files that start with cf within any folder\nwithin /var/spool/lpd\nAlso see the filter rules section on the man page.\n\nA: You can also exclude multiple paths within curly braces:\nrsync -arv --exclude={.ccache,build} /home/ben /media/ben/thumbdrive/\n\n", "Q: Lubuntu 13.04 How to install entire repo? I would like to install an entire repo, instead of going through and installing each package, is that possible??

The ubuntu-desktop package is a meta package that does nothing except list other packages to install. If it makes sense to install the entire repo in your case, I'd look for that kind of package. \n\nA: Use the Origin flag on packages\n\n\n*\n\n*Locate the raw repository release file of the repository concerned in /var/lib/apt/lists, e.g. dl.google.com_linux_chrome_deb_dists_stable_Release.\n\n*Use less or grep to find the Origin: line:\ngrep ^Origin\\: /var/lib/apt/lists/dl.google.com_linux_chrome_deb_dists_stable_Release\n\nFor me this outputs: Origin: Google, Inc.\n\n*Install aptitude , a package manager.\n\n*Using the Origin found earlier we can query for packages in aptitude:\naptitude search '~O \"Google, Inc.\"'\n\nTry to narrow down the search pattern if there's more than you expected. See the aptitude manual on search patterns for that.\n\n*If you like the results, install it:\nsudo aptitude install '~O \"Google, Inc.\"'\n\nNotes\n\n\n*\n\n*This does not take care about multiarch. The query above tries to install both i386 and amd64 packages.\n\n*I agree with Jo-Erlend Schinstad that you should use a metapackage to install a group of packages. This depends on the repository maintainer of course, so it may not be available for all.\n\n*You can also use GUI package managers for an easier way to accomplish the above. See my other answer to do so.\n\n\nA: I like to use muon  for this, but you can probably accomplish the same using Synaptic.\n\n\n*\n\n*Open Muon.\n\n*Filter by Origin (as shown in the screenshot).\n\n\n*Select all packages in the results.\n\n*Right-click, hit Mark for Installation\n\n*Click Apply Changes in the toolbar.\n", "Q: Will I be able to install Ubuntu Tablet on my Hipstreet Titan tablet? I have a Hipstreet Titan Tablet (HS-7dtb4-16G), will I be able to install Ubuntu Tablet on my Hipstreet Titan tablet?\n\nA: At this time, only two tablets are officially supported and they are Nexus 7 and Nexus 10. However, community members have made Ubuntu run on other devices. Since Ubuntu Touch shares drivers with Android, it should be possible, but it probably won't be easy. And Ubuntu Tablet is nowhere near ready for end-user use. It's not supposed to be. \nThe short answer to your question is that at this point, you probably won't be able to install Ubuntu on your device. It is theoretically possible, but it would require a lot of work and it will be anything but simple. In the long term, I think there's a good chance someone will enable you to install Ubuntu on it, but only time can tell. \n", "Q: Ubuntu 13 and Windows 7 are not friends I downloaded Ubuntu 13.04 64. I wanted to install it to dual boot with windows 7 64 bit.\nThe computer is a HP dv6 with Intel i7; 8 GB of RAM, and a 1 TB HDD.\nI tried for days to install Ubuntu but after reading a great deal on this site, I found out HP tools and Windows took up all 4 portions on the HDD. So I wiped out all the HP tools and restore stuff.\nI then installed Ubuntu. It wiped out Windows and my computer couldn't even see the hard drive. So I put the HDD in my other computer and was able to save all my data. I did a low level format and then reinstalled Windows, making sure not to let the HP tools back on the drive. This left me with Windows 7 only in my HDD. \nThen I tried to install Ubuntu a second time. I followed this tutorial to the nail.  It all seemed to go well: I created /boot, / and /home partitions; I didn't create a swap since I have 8 GB of RAM. It finished installing and said I needed to reboot. After I reboot, Windows loads up but no way to access Ubuntu.\nI've never used it and I am at a lost, it's so different from Windows. :( \nFixing Windows based systems is what I do, so I'm always the one giving help. I would be so very grateful for any help.\n\nA: The guide you were using suggests to install the grub bootloader to \"Sda5\", meaning the bootloader is installed to a partition rather than a drive (making it impossible to boot without additional software because your computer cannot look for bootloaders on a partition), after installing Ubuntu the guide further instructs you to add an additional ubuntu grub boot entry, this time to the windows bootloader using EasyBCD from windows. I'm guessing you didn't do that part of the guide yet? Which is why you cannot boot ubuntu yet. You can download easybcd and use it to add your ubuntu boot entry (instructions are in the guide you were using), or you can re-install ubuntu and set the bootloader to install to sda rather than sda5. The reason the guide is instructing you to install to sda5 is so that you can avoid erasing the windows bootloader, making things easier if you decide to ditch ubuntu down the road. \nsincerely, tapthoseshoesandwish\n\nA: It's a little bit difficult to understand, but it sounds like you've somehow managed to not install Ubuntus boot loader to your primary disk. This is necessary for any operating system. I'm not entirely sure why you performed manual partitioning as Ubuntus installer is very good at this and obviously makes it a lot easier. Disabling swap is also not necessarily a very good idea, as it's used if you ever want to hibernate, for instance. \nYou made things a lot easier when you freed up partitions. But I recommend that you delete those manually created partitions and just select \"use free space\" in Ubuntus installer. \n\nA: I have a new hp all in one with win. 7   I went into bios and disabled secure boot and enabled legacy boot. Everything work fine with no problems. The first time I tried I just enabled legacy boot and it did not install grub.\nThe key is you have to disable secure boot first, then enable legacy boot.\n\nA: You have a limit of 4 primary partitions, and your win7 computer uses all of them, just like mine was.\nI did the following :-\n\n\n*\n\n*Boot into the live cd\n\n*start the partition manager.\n\n*Kept the media partition for the linux partition\n\n*Resized the other partitions so that the partition was as large as I wanted to.\n\n*(Reboot to make sure I can still start Win7)\n\n*Boot into the live cd and start the installer\n\n*Install into the partition I set aside (the partitions I created for my Ubuntu install were logical partition\n\n", "Q: What is the authentication password? I'm very new to ubuntu, and i just installed it on my new chromebook acer c7. I never made an authentication password, and when I try to download something, it asks me for it. Please help!\n\nA: It is your own password. \nThe first user you create in Ubuntu is added to the group named admin. Users in this group can perform system tasks by providing their own passwords. So, let's say you have a family with a mother, a father and a child. That's three users. Parents are allowed to install new applications, but the child is not. Since father installs Ubuntu and is the first user, he is automatically allowed to do this. Then he adds mother to the admin group and then she is also allowed to install apps. But they don't have to share a password. When they're asked to authenticate in order to perform system tasks, they provide their own passwords. \nThis mechanism is called sudo and is very similar to Windows' runas. sudo has been used in Unix-like systems for a very long time and is probably the main inspiration for runas. \n", "Q: Some index files failed to download When I ran sudo apt-get update then I found some error.

You have a detailed description of all (many) the options that can be used in the configuration file lightdm.conf at /usr/share/doc/lightdm/lightdm.conf.\"\nFor example, for gdm, I resolved an issue by adding the following command to /etc/gdm/init/Default:\nif xrandr -q | grep -q \"CRT1 disconnected\"; then\n  xrandr --output LVDS --mode 1600x900 --pos 0x0 --primary\nfi\n\nSo perhaps you can research into that answer (and the upstart link) to determine if you can add a script which basically does the same thing (tho you won't need the if statement, if only running 1 monitor)... \nI had do this modification because after futzing around with xorg.conf to act like I wanted when booting from single monitor (laptop) to multi-monitor, when in single monitor mode, the GDM login screen was using the wrong resolution (it was using the multi-monitor virtual display size... I think), so issuing that BEFORE the initctl command for GDM resolved, and it should resolve for you too (I say should because I haven't looked into lightDM too heavily).\n", "Q: How to install steam through Ubuntu Software Center without logging into Ubuntu One I'm on 13.04 and I can't see any option to install steam directly through Ubuntu Software Center without logging in with Ubuntu One account.

Consider this script:\n#!/bin/bash\n\ncat\n\nWhen you start it as test.sh, you will see that the bash is the parent, and the cat is the child:\nxxx   4087 10976  0 08:29 pts/2    00:00:00 /bin/bash ./test.sh\nxxx   4088  4087  0 08:29 pts/2    00:00:00 cat\n\n", "Q: Where is the equivalent of /etc/sysconfig/networking/devices/ directory in Ubuntu?

I'm trying to use Tor, but the problem is when I click on the tor browser it says it needs an update. \nI grant permission (allowing execution of the file as a program) to start-tor-browser and I downloaded the most recent update bundle of Tor, but when I double click on start-tor-browser, a text file pops up, and I click on the Tor browser it says it needs an update. When I use the terminal's commands sudo start-tor-browser or sudo /start-tor-browser it says command not found. \nI'm new to Linux and I have very little knowledge of the OS. If needed I can post screen shots.\n\nA: If you double-click on (allow-executing-file-as-program) start-tor-browser, you should be presented with a dialog of four options: Run, Run-in-Terminal, Display and Cancel. Do you see these options? If so, try Run.\nAlternatively, you can set up a custom keyboard shortcut and use something like the following command (depending on where / into which folder you extracted tor):\n\"/home/user_name/my_tor/bundle/tor-browser_en-US/start-tor-browser\"\nto launch tor.\n(Don't use sudo.)\nIf you wanted to launch tor via the command line, you could navigate to the folder and just type start-tor-browser. Given that it's just locally downloaded and not formally installed, you'll need to supply the path (or register start-tor-browser manually - but that's a separate question).\n\nUpdate (mid-May 2015)\nThe previous command ceased to work for me.

Backstory: \nSince running 12.04 LTS, my computer has experienced two sudden losses of power; one due to my ham-fisted attempt to reboot and one due to a battery-less power cable disconnection. Both times there were booting problems directly after that the automatic fsck could not fix. I reinstalled after the first boot error and that fixed the problem but the second time I decided to try to figure out what the actual problem was. I learned a lot by messing around with the hard drive and OS trying to figure out what the heck was wrong but the two year old hard drive was unable to survive any more abuse and kicked the bucket before I found an answer. I have purchased a replacement but I am still looking for an autopsy and a way to prevent this from happening in the future.\nQuestions: \n\n\n*\n\n*What are some causes of boot problems after a sudden power off? The hard drive containing the OS not being properly unmounted? Could a forced shut down actually cause the hard drive itself to become confused? How does a forced shut down affect the journaling of an ext4 file system?\n\n*How can Ubuntu be configured to minimize damage from a sudden shut down? The obvious answer being \"Don't shut down by holding the power button, stupid\" and though I have found some alternate ways to force a misbehaving session to terminate, sudden shut downs are not always caused intentionally by the user. Running Ubuntu on a laptop also increases the chances of a less-than-graceful power off. If there are things within 12.04 (either OS settings or settings of the hard drive itself) that could be configured to minimize the damage, I would be grateful to be made aware of them.\n\n\nA: The only means of preventing data loss on systems suffering from possible power failures is\n\nFrequent Backups\n\nBut still there are some additional measures to minimize possible hard disk failures after a sudden power failure but these will be at cost of performance.\n\n\n*\n\n*Disable write cache for the drive\nsudo hdparm -W 0 /dev/<sdX>\n\n\n*Make shure journaling is enabled on an ext4 file system (default behaviour)\n\n*Do not disable (default) write barriers when mounting\n\n\nIn case we are very familiar with the Ubuntu file system hierarchy we may also consider putting those system directories which do not need write access on a partition mounted real only. This will help to still have a booting system even if there was a file corruption elsewhere, but it will not prevent you from losing your personal data. In the case of a non-server system I do not recommend this because restoring a backup or even a reinstall will always be faster than getting a read-only system file hierarchy working stable.\nSource and urther reading:\n\n\n*\n\n*Prevent data corruption on ext4/Linux drive on power loss\n\n*“safe” ext4 configuration for systems running unattended\n\n*Ext4 sfiel system on Arch Wiki\n\nA: So to your first question: What are some causes of boot problems after a sudden power off?\nAt shutdown the OS mainly waits until all Apps are correctly shutdown, shuts down Services,  saves settings etc. It's unlikely the whole machine will die after force shutting it down. If you have any DATA in the buffer then you will lose those. Think of it as things you need take with you every day. If you forget something you wont' die but will be unhappy.     \nWell there are many causes of boot problems but the most common ones are:\n\n\n*\n\n*Hardware failure. (Hard-disk, motherboard, RAM etc.)\n\n*OS failure. (OS got disrupted)\n\n*User (Sometimes the User messes with stuff he/she does not know of :P)\n\n*Power loss (can be fatal, if you don't have the right power-supply your PC's gona have a hard )\n\n\nTo your second question: How can Ubuntu be configured to minimize damage from a sudden shut down?\nIn my experience a Backup Solution is always a good Idea. The thing is if your System freezes (And especially with Ubuntu that is a big IF) and you have to force shutdown the System, it should be no problem to recover with a Backup. But If your System crashes and you get a Hardware failure there is almost nothing you can do, except replace the broken part. :P   \nHere's a step by step how to Backup in Ubuntu:\nOpen System Settings:\n\nClick on Backup:\n\nHere you can set up your Backed-up Folders, when to Backup, where to BNac and how long your Backup should be saved:\n\n\n\n\n", "Q: Windows 7 & Ubuntu I want to download Ubuntu on Windows 7 and dual boot the two but before I do there is the question, can i dual boot Windows 7 and Ubuntu? And if I do, does it work and is it safe for the OS?\nWhat is the procedure to follow after downloading Ubuntu to dual boot with Windows 7?\n\nA: First of all, yes it is safe to do. Lots of people dual boot windows 7 and ubuntu, myself included.\nYou can install a dual-boot version of Ubuntu from within Windows by using this installer:\nhttp://www.ubuntu.com/download/desktop/windows-installer\nIt is then a very straight-forward type of installation, typical of Windows applications.

If you installed something from Internet using .bundle or .run package, you have to search in Internet the right way to remove that package. For example, VMWare and Oracle have their own installation managers.\nSome common uninstallation procedures for famous packages:\nNVidia drivers (in case you have installed it through .run package)\nHere is the original answer. Just run sudo NVIDIA-Linux-XXX-YYY.ZZ.run --uninstall.\nATI drivers\nHere is the original answer. Run sudo sh /usr/share/ati/fglrx-uninstall.sh.\nOracle Universal Installer\n$ORACLE_HOME/oui/bin/runInstaller\n\nNote that ORACLE_HOME must contain path to Oracle Home directory.\nVMWare Workstation\nTaken from there. Run vmware-installer --uninstall-product vmware-workstation.\nSources package\nIn package home directory, run sudo make uninstall.\nBut in most cases, it is better to search for the distribution-provided package or for package in PPA. The exclusion is Calibre, which recommends install itself using Python script. And it's uninstallation procedure is pretty simple:\nsudo rm -rf /opt/calibre/*\n\nHope it helps.\n", "Q: Can't connect to Android device My Android device won't connect.

If you tap it, it should bring up two options. One is use as mtp device and the other is use it as mass storage. Tap mass storage then tap the new notification that pops up and tap the button that says \"mount USB storage\". It'll pick it up like a thumb drive (or two thumb drives, depending on if you have a memory card.) From then on when you connect it, just tap \"mount USB storage\"\n... or so it works like that on my stock Galaxy S II.

However, you can do this via your window manager configuration, or using a window manipulation tool such as maximus.\nFor example, our kiosk OS (which is based on Ubuntu) has an option to open all application windows full screen.  To do this, we use the Compiz \"Window Rules\" plugin and set the \"Maximized\" window match to \"type=Normal | type=Unknown\" (this makes non-application windows such as dialogs open normally).  We also disable decorations for these windows using the \"Decoration\" plugin.\nThere's more than one way to do it, though.  For example, you could use the Maximus program.  This is a separate utility that runs alongside the window manager and maximizes application windows when they are created.\nI suggest reading through some of the answers to the question \"How to configure my system so that all windows start maximized?\", one of which includes more detailed instructions for configuring Compiz as I've described here.\nOf course, if you used our free web-based configuration tool this would just take a click to configure. ;)\nGood luck!\n", "Q: Upstart - Bluepill not starting without sudo I have an upstart service to start bluepill (Ruby gem to monitor processes).

Looking at the log, it seems like bluepill is starting as a non-privileged user and thus fails.\nCan anybody explain why?\nI don't want sudo to be used, because, when I give respawn, upstart tracks the PID of the sudo process and not the PID of the actual bluepill process.\n\nA: I seriously doubt that your job is starting correctly. Most likely you would find in /var/log/upstart/yourjobconfigname.log following line:\n\nsudo: sorry, you must have a tty to run sudo\n\nsudo is meant to be used interactively. See How should I use sudo from an upstart script? for details.\nYou should reconsider your design. It will be much better to create dedicated system user that will run your job process and apply needed permissions. In your job configuration you would need to add setuid and perhaps setgid stanzas.\ndescription \"Start up the bluepill service\"\n\nstart on runlevel [2]\nstop on runlevel [016]\n\nsetuid bluepill\nsetgid bluepill\nexec sudo /home/deploy/.rvm/wrappers/<app_name>/bluepill load /home/deploy/websites/<app_name>/current/config/server/staging/delayed_job.bluepill\n\nbluepill is added designated system user.

While executing a C program, a.out, using the Ubuntu terminal, why do I always need to type ./ before a.out, instead of just writing a.out? Is there solution for this?\n\nA: The reason for this is simple.\nSuppose you have a command with the same name as an application in the current directory. Then running the command in the shell would invoke your app instead of the built-in command. This would be a security concern if nothing else.\nBy requiring ./ to be used in front, the shell knows that you want to execute the application with the given name and not a built-in command with that name.\n\nA: ./ executes files that are not in your $PATH, rather it executes the file in the current directory (or another via ./home/stefano/script.sh). Now, PATH is an environment variable that contains all of the places where bash can look for executable programs, without having the full (absolute) path to them.\nThis seperation is needed to avoid running the wrong file. I.e. if you have a file called ls in your home directory, it not being in your PATH will prevent bash from confusing it with the real ls. The PATH variable also defines the search order:\n\n*\n\n*When you run a command, or a program tries to make an exec syscall (a special method of the Kernel, how programs are started), the system looks for the file by going through each of the directories in your PATH. Once the program has been found, even if it's in multiple directories, the search is interrupted and the first one found is run.\n\nTo run a file, you will need to set the executable bit in the permissions:\n\n*\n\n*Since you're already on the command line, you can just type chmod +x finename.\n\n\n*Or you can set the permissions by right clicking the file and selecting Properties:\n\nYou can now copy the file to any of the directories in PATH, to see which ones are in there - and they're set on a per-user basis - type echo $PATH.\nstefano@3000-G530:~$ echo $PATH\n/usr/local/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/sbin:/usr/bin:/sbin:/bin:/usr/games\n\nIf you create an executable file, cat, and move it to /usr/local/sbin, it is run instead of the proper cat, which resides in /bin. You can find out where your files are by using type cat and whereis cat.\n\nA: When you type the name of a program such as a.out the system looks for the file in your PATH. On my system, PATH is set to\n/usr/lib/lightdm/lightdm:/usr/local/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/sbin:/usr/bin:/sbin:/bin:/usr/games:/usr/local/games\n\nYours is probably similar.  To check, enter echo $PATH in  a terminal.\nThe system looks through these directories in the order given and if it can't find the program produces a command not found error.\nPrepending the command with ./ effectively says \"forget about the PATH, I want you to look only in the current directory\".\nSimilarly you can tell the system to look in only another specific location by prepending the command with a relative or absolute path such as:\n../ means in the parent directory eg ../hello look for hello in the parent directory.\n./Debug/hello : \"look for hello in the Debug subdirectory of my current directory.\"\nor /bin/ls : \"look for ls in the directory /bin\"\nBy default, the current directory is not in the path because it's considered a security risk. See Why is . not in the path by default? on Superuser for why.\nIt's possible to add the current directory to your PATH, but for the reasons given in the linked question, I would not recommend it.\n\nA: Why do you need to type ./ before executing a program?\nIn the terminal, whenever you type the name of an application, let's say gedit, the terminal will go look in some (pre-defined) directories that contain applications (the binaries of the applications). The names of these directories are contained in a variable called PATH. You can see what's in this variable by executing echo $PATH. See those directories separated by :? Those are the directories that the terminal will go search in, if you just type gedit, nautilus, or a.out. As you can see, the path of your a.out program is not there. When you do ./a.out, you're telling the terminal \"look in the current directory, and run a.out, and don't go look in PATH.\nSolution 1\nIf you don't want to type ./ every time, you'll need to add a.out's directory in $PATH. In the following instructions, I'll assume that the path to a.out is /path/to/programs/, but you should change it to your actual path.\n\n\n*\n\n*Simply add the following line to the end of the file ~/.pam_environment:\nPATH DEFAULT=${PATH}:/path/to/programs\n\nSource: Persistent environment variables\n\n*Log out and log back in. You'll now be able to run a.out without ./ from any directory.\nIf you have other programs in other directories, you can just add those to the above line. However, I'd advise to have one directory called \"myPrograms\" for example, and put all of your programs under it.\nSolution 2\n\nNote: change userName to your actual Ubuntu username.\n\nWhat if you have other programs you want to run? And they're all in different folders? Well, a \"more organized\" solution would be to create a folder called bin under your Home directory, and add symbolic links (shortcuts) under that folder. Here's how:\n\n\n*\n\n*mkdir /home/userName/bin\n\n\n*\n\n*This will create the folder bin under your Home directory.\n\n\n*ln -s /path/to/programs/a.out /home/userName/bin\n\n\n*\n\n*This will create a \"symbolic link\" (basically, a shortcut) of your a.out program under bin.\n\n\n*Log out and log back in. You'll now be able to run a.out without ./ from any directory.\nNow, whenever you have another program anywhere else, let's say the program b.in on your Desktop, all you need to do is: ln -s /home/userName/Desktop/b.in /home/userName/bin, and you'll then be able to run it without ./ as well.\n\nNote: thanks to @Joe's comment, when you do backups, symbolic links have to be handled specially. By default, rsync doesn't process them at all, so when you restore, they're not there.\n\n\nA: As George pointed out in his answer, this helps you note that your executing a file in the current working directory (pwd).\nI remember asking this question to my senior a long time ago, he said I should add . to my path so that when I do a.out it looks in the current directory and executes that. In this case I don't have to do ./a.out.\nBut, personally, I'd recommend against it. It never happened to me, but if you are on an alien network directory or something, and a malicious executable file called ls exists there, then having . in your path is a very bad idea. Not that you will run into this problem very often, just saying.\n\nA: In addition to other answers, here the essential part from man bash which explains that well:\nCOMMAND EXECUTION\n       After a command has been split into words, if it results  in  a  simple\n       command  and  an  optional list of arguments, the following actions are\n       taken.\n\n       If the command name contains no slashes, the shell attempts  to  locate\n       it.   If  there  exists a shell function by that name, that function is\n       invoked as described above in FUNCTIONS.  If the name does not match  a\n       function,  the shell searches for it in the list of shell builtins.  If\n       a match is found, that builtin is invoked.\n\n       If the name is neither a shell function nor a builtin, and contains  no\n       slashes,  bash  searches  each element of the PATH for a directory con‐\n       taining an executable file by that name.\n\nA: A './' makes sense when you run a program that is known for you and specific, e.g. your own one. This program must be present in your current directory.\nA './' makes no sense when you run a standard command that is somewhere in the $PATH.\nA command \"which command-to-run\" tells you where the command-to-run is in the $PATH.\n\nA: $ gcc hello.c -o /path/to/someplace/hello\n\nwill produce an executable in some location. If that location is on your path, you will be able to run the file. You can script this if you like to create a label for the action \"compile this source code using the gcc and place an executable at some location that is on your path\"\nI would suggest you create a new directory called \"testbin\" or something of that sort and put it on your path to keep your existing path directories clean. \n\nA: ./ eliminates unnecessary search for a path. ./ force to search in the current directory only. If we don't give ./ then it will search various path set into the system like /usr/bin, /usr/sbin/, etc.\n\nA: \"./\" means you want to execute a file in the current directory its a shortcut for typing the whole path for example:\n[root@server ~]#/path/to/file/file.pl\n\nis same as :\n[root@server file]#./file.pl\n\nin the previous example you went through the directory and its sup-directories to the file location and used \"./\" to run the file in the current directory.\nthe one before it \"[root@server ~]#/path/to/file/file.pl\" also will execute the file if you lazy to \"cd\" your way to the file location.\n\nA: It's very simple and has many uses.\n\n\n*\n\n*When multiple versions of same application is installed, it will be available in different path but a soft link to your binary can be created in /usr/bin. For example, Python 2.7, Python 2.6 is installed but /usr/bin/python -> python2.7 /usr/local/bin/python -> python2.6\n\n\nIf you are in the path /usr/local/bin and executes Python it will always execute Python 2.7.  Specifying . will take the current folder's executable.  \n\n\n*\n\n*. - always represents execute from the current directory. And .. always means executes from the previous directory.\n\n", "Q: Is it possible to hide Netbeans title bar like Firefox in Gnom 3? I am using Ubuntu 13.047 with Gnome 3. I want to hide Netbeans(7.3.1) title bar like Firefox. Is it possible?\n\nA: No, it is not. Netbeans, and all Java applications that use Swing toolkit draw their widgets on their own, without guidance from window manager (as is the case with Qt or GTK). So, you can not hide parts of the GUI, change fonts or colors, automate clicks and so on, unless the application directly supports it, which Netbeans, I think, do not.

I want to install this particular package kdmtheme. But when I do apt-cache search kdmtheme I get no results.

Since no extra repos are installed while installing kubuntu-desktop I cannot install these via terminal using apt-get, can I? For doing this I will have to add additional software repos of KDE, right?\n\nA: After you install kubuntu-desktop, the repositories and PPAs remain unchanged. Now, I will try to explain why you cannot install what you wish. This happens most often when you give wrong names for the packages.\nWhen you don't find a package with apt-cache search <package_name>, try to search for a part of the package name.\nIn your case, apt-cache search kdm will return something like:\njfsutils - utilities for managing the JFS filesystem\nldm - LTSP display manager\nldm-server - server components for LTSP display manager\nkde-workspace-kgreet-plugins - KDE greet libraries for authentication\nkdm - KDE Display Manager for X11\nkdm-gdmcompat - Provide basic gdm functionality to systems running kdm\nkdm-theme-aperture - very glossy Qt4/KDE4 kdm theme - aperture variant\n\nkdm-theme-bespin - very glossy Qt4/KDE4 kdm theme\nkdm-theme-tibanna - very glossy Qt4/KDE4 kdm theme - tibanna variant\nlibpam-usb - PAM module for authentication with removable USB block devices\nlxdm - GUI login manager for LXDE\nrddmarc - DMARC report processing scripts collection\n\nSo, the package name what were you looking for is kdm-theme-bespin.

Also, logging services are not yet running.\nA possible workaround for these issues is to send the data that should be preserved to the kernel message buffer.

However, any time an update comes through for Unity, this setting is reversed back to the default of loading the Unity module last, and killing the hot corners.\nSo I need a command line method to change the setting in dconf-editor located at org/compiz/profiles/unity/plugins/core from:\n['core', 'composite', 'opengl', 'copytex', 'decor', 'regex', \n'compiztoolbox', 'place', 'imgpng', 'grid', 'unitymtgrabhandles', \n'resize', 'mousepoll', 'snap', 'gnomecompat', 'move', 'vpswitch', \n'session', 'wall', 'animation', 'workarounds', 'expo', 'scale', \n'fade', 'ezoom', 'unityshell']\n\nto:\n['core', 'composite', 'opengl', 'copytex', 'decor', 'regex', \n'compiztoolbox', 'place', 'imgpng', 'grid', 'unitymtgrabhandles', \n'resize', 'mousepoll', 'snap', 'gnomecompat', 'move', 'vpswitch', \n'session', 'wall', 'animation', 'workarounds', 'fade', 'ezoom', \n'unityshell', 'expo', 'scale']\n\nRunning the command:\ngsettings list-schemas | grep -i compiz\n\nshows that there's no schema for what I need to change. So trying this instead:\ngsettings list-recursively | grep -i compiz\n\ngives a much longer list, but not much useful to my project.\nWhere have I gone wrong or is there another solution to my problem?\n\nA: I expect it to be this, adding \"quotes\" to the value as part of the proper GVariant formatting required for setting strings.\ngsettings set org.compiz.core:/org/compiz/profiles/unity/plugins/core/ active-plugins \\\n \"['core', 'composite', 'opengl', 'copytex', 'decor', 'regex', 'compiztoolbox', 'place' \n,'imgpng', 'grid', 'unitymtgrabhandles', 'resize', 'mousepoll', 'snap', 'gnomecompat',\n'move', 'vpswitch', 'session', 'wall', 'animation', 'workarounds', 'fade', 'ezoom', \n'unityshell', 'expo', 'scale']\"\n\n", "Q: how to stop socket with linux command? how to stop socket in linux :\nsocket ==> \nroot@root:/home/aa/test# netstat | grep 3966      \ntcp        0      0 server:3966       server:57004       TIME_WAIT  \n\nthank \n\nA: Try this.

I've seen similar questions to this but none have really answered the exact question I have.\nAre update-alternatives and PATH related, or alternatives to one another? I ask because I'm a complete beginner with Ubuntu and am setting up Java on my machine. Some guides I've followed download and extract it and then enter a location for JAVA_HOME and export it usually in the user's bashrc file, like so:\nJAVA_HOME=/usr/lib/jvm/jdk1.7.0_21/\nexport JAVA_HOME\n\nHowever, other guides use the update-alternatives install command, like so:\nsudo update-alternatives --install \"/usr/bin/java\" \"java\" \"/usr/lib/jvm/jdk1.7.0/bin/java\" 1\nsudo update-alternatives --install \"/usr/bin/javac\" \"javac\" \"/usr/lib/jvm/jdk1.7.0/bin/javac\" 1\nsudo update-alternatives --install \"/usr/bin/javaws\" \"javaws\" \"/usr/lib/jvm/jdk1.7.0/bin/javaws\" 1\n\nI know the latter effectively sets up a symlink to the /usr/bin folder which I think is a quite \"clean\" way of doing it. How does the export JAVA_HOME way work? And is one preferable to the other?\n\nA: read man\nman update-alternatives\n\nupdate-alternatives creates, removes, maintains and  displays  information  about  the symbolic links comprising the Debian alternatives system.\nFor example, if the text  editors  ed(1)  and  nvi(1)  are  both installed on the system, the alternatives system will cause the generic name /usr/bin/editor to refer to /usr/bin/nvi by default\nthey are not related -> directly (but indirectly), update-alternatives make changes in directories which are described in PATH\n", "Q: Toshiba satellite L855-12R overheats I bought a Toshiba Satellite L855-12R several months ago and started playing Assassin's Creed.

I have 2 NICs, one configured for IPv4, the other for IPv6.  I want to ensure that whenever port 1337 is used, it goes through the IPv6 interface.\n\nA: I think that you can do that using iptables.  A rule in IP table should do it, but I think that the NIC in question has to have a IP assigned to it.  Try this, just press Ctrl+Alt+T on your keyboard to open Terminal. When it opens, run the command(s) below:\niptables -A PREROUTING -p tcp --dport xxxx -i eth1\n\nReplace xxxx with the port number.

I want to use a command line, but don't know how this configuration looks like and where to save it.\n\nA: According to the source code, it uses GConf to store configuration. Gconf can be manipulated from the command line using gconftool-2 but you do need to understand the schema because gconftool is pretty low-level and can't ensure that your changes are correct or consistent.\nYou might find it easier to use the nautilus action configuration tool to change an action and gconftool to see what gets changed than to make sense of the schema description directly.\n\nA: When they are exported  by going to tools: export aassistant (also, look at Edit-Preferences-Export) they contain Gconf settings, but at the same time the settings made in nautilus action configuration tool are .desktop files created in /.local/share/file-manager/actions, and those do not contain such settings, except some that stand for the upper levels of a tree-menu.\nFor example, after creating this setting in  Nautilus action configuration tool:\n\nwhich gives this:\n\nthe upper level menus like \"Subtitles\" and \"Download subtitles\" contain lines like ItemsList=3f0b618c-c6fe-436c-86a9-2ebd9b1a77dd;1601ae38-5d78-4214-aeef-b7feb9864fc7;d67b7f55-6b10-418b-bfe8-eb9d4e5e7732;66242038-c8b1-414f-9ef2-4d5bb831a027;, which are gconf settings that cannot really be edited manually in the text file, while the lowest level items (the actions themselves - EN, RO, FR, etc) do not have such code lines and can be edited.\n", "Q: how to install xubuntu 13.04 theme to Ubuntu 13.04 i would like to know how to install default xubuntu theme along with xubuntu default icon to Ubuntu 13.04.\n\nA: If you want to install a theme just copy your extracted theme to ~/.themes\nor for your icons ~/.icons.\n", "Q: Add windows boot manager entry for Ubuntu on Windows 7 I installed Ubuntu few months back via the windows installer and use it on a daily basis on my notebook in a dual-boot setup. \nI wanted to free up some space in Win7 by removing some programs and I removed Ubuntu related application also accidentaly. I don't know whether it harmed my Ubuntu system or not (I hope it's not) but I know that it removed Ubuntu entry from windows boot loader, so I'm not able to boot to Ubuntu now.\nSo, my question is how can I add an entry to my windows boot loader on Win7 which points to my Ubuntu system? I tried to solve this issue with EasyBCD 2.2 without any luck.\nI run boot-repair and got the following log of my system: Link to my partition info\nIf somebody could be so kind to tell me what shoud I do I would highly appriciate.\n\nA: The key to your question is: \"I installed Ubuntu few months back via the windows installer...\"\nThis is known as WUBI install, and is not the same as dual-boot.\nIn WUBI, no partitions are created for Ubuntu. Instead, a large file is used inside the Windows system as a virtual partition that stored all your Ubuntu related files. When you removed \"Ubuntu related application\" Windows deleted that file as well as the entry in the Windows bootloader. Everything related to Ubuntu is gone now.\nThe best course of action is to install Ubuntu as a true dual-boot by booting directly from a Live USB/DVD and restore your personal files from a backup.

I installed the Heroku Toolbelt the other day, and it looks like Ruby was a requirement, so the package manager installed it for me. But I was planning to install Ruby through RVM. Will the two Rubys conflict?\n\nA: RVM allows you to install multiple versions of rubies and manage switching between them without the risk of conflicts between them.\nTo use any rvm build ruby:\nrvm use 1.9.3\n\nFor getting back to system installed ruby:\nrvm use system\n\nThis is equivalent to rvm reset which means - stop using any rvm installed ruby.\nYou can also tell rvm to \"mount\" system ruby, which will allow you creating gemsets with it:\nrvm automount # OR:\nrvm mount /path/to/ruby\n\n\nA: Whenever you install something outside of your package manager (apt) there is the potential for problems. The most common problem would be overwriting a system library used by other applications causing conflicts or breakage. Alternately , libs used by Ruby could be over written when you update a program via apt-get.\nThere is a nice discussion on the advantages / disadvantages of a package manager here:\nhttps://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Package_management_system\nIn general, use apt (apt-get) if at all possible. If there is a problem with the package in Ubuntu, report a bug, use a ppa, etc.\nIf all else fails, I advise you compile from source manually and watch for conflicts.\n", "Q: Setting up wired broadband with static IP I was using my wired broadband connection perfectly with windows.

I am trying to resize my Asus Zenbook UX31E's partition, but it does not work using GParted on a LiveUSB. Here is what I do:\n\n\n*\n\n*Download Ubtuntu 13.04, and burn it to a usb, using the software that comes with Ubuntu\n\n*Reboot into the Live envirorment\n\n*Unmount all the partitions\n\n*Open GParted\n\n*Resizes /dev/sda2 using \"Right click -> Move/Resize\".

It's an obnoxious service and I couldn't figure out how to get to the GParted details file you posted there through all the ads it plastered on my screen. Something like the Ubuntu pastebin works better and is free.\nAs to your problem, the usual cause is that GParted is trying to round a partition start or end point to the nearest 1MiB boundary (or possibly to some other value, depending on the alignment settings you've chosen), but your disk was originally partitioned with some other alignment scheme. This can cause GParted to mistakenly adjust the partition start or end point so that it overlaps with another partition, which of course is not legal.\nThe best solution is to adjust the start and/or end point of the partition so that there's a gap between it and the surrounding partitions. A 1MiB gap should be sufficient, but if that doesn't work, try 2MiB or even more.\n\nA: It sounds like you might have encountered the following bug: \nBug 686668 - Growing logical partition overlaps end of extended partition\nThis bug was not fixed until GParted 0.14.1.  The workaround suggested by Rod should work.\nI suggest you try using the latest version of GParted (currently 0.16.1).  The easiest way to do this is with GParted Live written to CD or USB flash drive.\n", "Q: How to mount FTP resources with fstab when connection is available? I'd like to automount an FTP folder using curlftpfs putting in fstab a row like:\ncurlftpfs#user:pwd@myhost:port/folder/ /mnt/mymountfolder fuse allow_other,uid=1000,gid=1000,umask=0022,_netdev 0 0\n\nNormally it wouldn't work, as during the boot the network (wifi usually) is not available for my laptop. I read that _netdev option in fstab should ensure the mounting only when the network is available, but I receive the message:\nError connecting to ftp: Couldn't resolve host myhost\n\nAlternatively I could mount the resource with an autorun script after the login has been made, but I'd like much more the fstab solution.\nThe final goal is to syncronize a local folder with the ftp folder with a crontab rsync, so if you have other suggestions, I will be grateful!\n\nA: As your goal is \"to syncronize a local folder with the ftp folder with a crontab rsync\", I suggest you to write a small script that mounts the FTP, rsync, unmount FTP. Then run this script from crontab.\nIt should go something like this:\n#!/bin/bash\ncurlftpfs user:pwd@myhost:port/folder/ /mnt/mymountfolder\n#might need sleep 1 here\nrsync -a /mnt/mymountfolder /local/folder\nfusermount -uz /mnt/mymountfolder\n\nMake sure you chmod +x on the script.\ncrontab -e\n#m h d M wd\n0 * * * * /usr/local/bin/backup-script\n\nAlso, if you really want the FTP folder mounted all the time, you could make a script that mounts/unmounts your drive. If you also add it to fstab, you could manually mount the drive.\nfstab:\ncurlftpfs#user:pwd@myhost:port/folder/ /mnt/mymountfolder fuse noauto,user,uid=1000,gid=1000,umask=0022 0 0\n\nnetwork-mount.sh:\n#!/bin/bash\nfolder=/media/ftp\n# check if host is alive\nping=`/usr/bin/fping -q host.dyn.org`\nif [ $? == 0 ]; then\n  # check if folder is mounted\n  mountpoint $folder > /dev/null\n  if [ $? != 0 ]\n    # mount, timeout in case something goes wrong\n    then timeout 10s mount $folder\n  fi\n  else\n  mountpoint $folder > /dev/null\n  if [ $? = 0 ]\n    #unmount lazy (network down)\n    then umount -l $folder\n  fi\nfi\n\nAdd this to crontab (crontab -e):\n* * * * * /usr/local/bin/network-mount.sh\n\nAlso watch out for your rsync not completing before the next is run. This could be done automatically(check if rsync running), or based upon how much data that need to be in sync(amount of time rsync takes, worst case scenario).\nAssuming you don't run rsync for anything else, checking if it's running could be done like this:\npgrep rsync\nif [ $? == 0 ]; then\n  # rsync running\n  exit\nelse\n  # rsync not running\n  #do stuff\nfi\n\n\nA: I'm using SFTP / sshfs for that purpose\necho password | sshfs username@serverIP:/ /mnt/mountpointfolder -p portnumber -o reconnect -o password_stdin\n\nNot sure if there is a fstab way. If you execute a cron job doing this every x minutes, would be ok. If the folder is already mounted, you will just get \"already connected\" error. If you are disconnected, you will get another error and no connection will be made. But when you are connected again, you will connect in a minute... In case of cron job you can remove -o reconnect part.\nMake the script file secure as it contain the password. \n\nA: You may try curlftpfs option \n\nconnect_timeout=N (seconds).\n\nIn your example (let us say 30 secs are enough),\n\ncurlftpfs#user:pwd@myhost:port/folder/ /mnt/mymountfolder,  uid=1000, gid=1000, umask=0022, connect_timeout=30 0 0 fuse -o allow_other\n\nAlternatively, you can remove from fstab and connect in Nautilus, then save it as bookmark and connect each time you startup.\n", "Q: Not able to run sudo apt-get update in 12.10 I am trying to run sudo apt-get update but getting below mentioned error .. do you think there is any issue with Ubuntu's installation?\nE: Could not get lock /var/lib/dpkg/lock - open (11: Resource temporarily unavailable)\nE: Unable to lock the administration directory (/var/lib/dpkg/), is another process using it?\n\nYour help is highly appreciated ...Thanks\n\nA: Try this.

Use some file manager to remove them, for example midnight commander. If you wandt to read the characters behind ? marks, use following guide (Full switch locale: Ubuntu server installed with no locales, how to enable locales systemwide?)\nYour home folder is often used by some install scripts or installed software usually creates its own folder beginning with \".\" character (invisible folders - but probably not the case u have).

Thanks\nHere's a screenshot of the current devices listed on Nautilus.\n\n\nA: Linux handles drives in a different manner to Windows.\nIn Windows, every partition and volume is assigned a separate drive letter, like C: for partition where the OS is installed, D: for a DVD drive, and so on for removable USB devices and the like.\nSince Windows XP, there has been the option to mount an NTFS partition onto another already existing format. It is this kind of system that Ubuntu and other Linux distros use. The main filesystem is mount at '/', and other volumes are mounted at some point within the filesystem, typically within the '/mnt/' directory. When you click on a drive that isn't already mounted in the launcher or Nautilus, Ubuntu auto-mounts it to a folder in the '/mount/' directory. If you can see the partition you want to access in Nautilus, you should be able to just double-click it and it should auto-mount and display its files.\nIf that works, great! You're done. If not, it can be a little more complicated. Each volume is automatically assigned a reference file in the '/dev/' directory. For hard disks, these are typically of the form '/dev/sdX' or '/dev/sdxY', where X is a letter indicating the disk, starting from 'a', and Y is a number indicating the partition, starting from '1'. to manually mount a partition, do the following:\n\n\n*\n\n*Open a terminal (with CTRL + ALT + T or from the launcher)\n\n*Create a directory for the volume to be mounted to in the '/mnt/' directory (e.g. sudo mkdir /mnt/folder)\n\n*Use the mount command to first check if the drive you're trying to mount is already mounted. If so, do sudo umount /dev/sdXY\n\n*Once unmounted, do sudo mount /dev/sdXY /mnt/folder\n\n*To open the mounted volume in Nautilus, do nautilus /mnt/folder &. You can close the terminal now.\n\n\nIf anything is unclear or confusing, just leave a comment.\n\nA: Yes you can mount all NTFS Windows disks without any problems. You can mount them on the start via fstab or you can let ubuntu to detect them automatically and mount on demand. You can follow this guide: How to automount NTFS partitions?\n", "Q: Should I backup my data partition before installing Ubuntu? I have my HDD with two partitions (C:\\ with W7 on it and D:\\ with all my data). I really want to leave W7 behind and get my laptop only running Ubuntu :). When I run the installation CD, ¿will it delete my D:\\ partition as well? Or can I install Ubuntu just fine without backing up my D:\\ partition? I appreciate a lot your help.\n\nA: Hardware can and does fail all the time.\nSo short answer you should backup whenever your system changes by enough that were you to lose it all it would take an unacceptable amount of time to recover.\nIt's difficult to put an exact figure on that but for me I backup my system every week at least and I have two separate backup devices so that if one fails I can always go back to the previous backup.\nIf like me you are reliant on your data you will want to backup regularly.  I also backup project specific data to a memory stick on a daily basis. Unfortunately there are two kinds of people: those who will lose data and those who backup.\nIf there is little on your PC that is important to you: for example you only use it to play games and surf the Web you may be happier to back up less often.\nHowever, while upgrading and installing are becoming less of a risk we see far too many questions here and on other support sites such as Launchpad and Ubuntu Forums where people have lost data so and I can't say this too strongly:\nBackup all your data first\nAlso bear in mind that when windows talks about a C: drive and a D: drive there is no such concept in Linux.  Windows users often confuse drives and partitions.\nIf you tell the installer to use the whole drive it will.  If your windows D: drive is not a drive but a partition it will be overwritten.  \nIt's possible to install Ubuntu along side Windows or to install Ubuntu where your old C: partition was but keep the data that was on your old D: partition but you need to read the instructions carefully.  \nYou should be OK if you take your time and think about each question you are asked but if something goes wrong it will be a lot easier to fix if you have a backup.    \n\nA: \"YES\".\nWhenever installing an operating system or doing any major changes to your hard disk or partition information, you should always make a backup.\nIt should really not touch your second (data) partition, but mistakes or accidents can happen, and the question to ask yourself is, can you afford to lose the data in D:? If the answer to that question is \"NO\", then the answer to your question is \"YES\" :)\n", "Q: I can't log into ubuntu server 12.04.2 because it won't let me enter my password on my virtual machine, how can I fix this?

With this question I refer to the one, where to add fonts to libreoffice :\nWhy I can't install new fonts in LibreOffice?\nHow can I add new fonts to gimp ?\n\nA: You have to add the fonts that you want to Ubuntu first, and then it will be available to Gimp, and other apps as well.\nDownload the font that you want, and use Font viewer to install it.\n\n\nA: If you install your fonts to the .fonts folder, they will be available for all programs from within your user's session.\nFor the GIMP specifically, you can also check the Preferences from the menu Edit > Preferences, then Folders | Fonts (see image, below). There you can find out where GIMP's own fonts folder is and add/manage additional font folders.\nSo, if you want some specific fonts to be available exclusively to GIMP, you would copy the font files to GIMP's font folder.\nIf you want GIMP to be able to use fonts in your system that are not available system-wide (e.g., installed by TeXLive or other programs in their own folders), you add the corresponding font folder.\n\nClick on the image for a full-resolution version.\nNote: It is not necessary to add the .fonts folder to the GIMP Preferences.\n\nA: In my case the solution was move the folder with tff files inside to /usr/share/fonts/truetype folder, in spite of that this path are not setted in typography folder in gimp settings, but works! :)\n", "Q: How to install Canon Pixma MP620?

I believe the recommended method would involve using the existing scripts on /etc/grub.d because the /boot/grub/grub.cfg will get replaced if I change it manually.\n\nA: First of all, the effect I need (joining grub menu from one distribution with other) does not need chainloading; it is enough to merely re-load grub configuration with the configfile Grub 2 command in file /etc/grub.d/40_custom, like this:\nmenuentry \"Ubuntu Precise 64 bit\" {\n   configfile (hd0,gpt2)/grub/grub.cfg   \n}\n\nwhere (hd0,gpt2) is the address of the /boot partition of the other Linux (it is 2nd partition on GPT sda disk in this example). \nAfter the edit it is important to run sudo update-grub, so the changes are propagated into /boot/grub/grub.cfg\nThis way one can keep elegant and error-free way of maintaining two separate Linux instalations (which might for instance share the same btrfs root partition, but on different subvolumes)\n\nA: On bios system, I prefer to chainload with the multiboot option :\nmenuentry \"Ubuntu, Trusty (on lvm/nantes-trusty)\" --class gnu-linux --class gnu --class os {\ninsmod part_gpt\ninsmod lvm\ninsmod ext2\nset root='lvm/nantes-trusty'\nmultiboot /boot/grub/i386-pc/core.img\n}\n\nThe advantage with that is you can recreate a partition dedicated to grub, that will never change unless you want to remove or add another OS, and you are not making os dependent on themselves, wich is very usefull when there are changes in grub versions.\nBecause it happened to me to have a grub version that would load an old grub.cfg file.\nThis is not happening here, because when you load core.img, you load the grub that goes along it's own grub.cfg file.\nIn fact it's similar to what uefi does when it loads grub, because you give him something like core.efi instead of core.img\n", "Q: how to change color depth to 32 bit? I have Ubuntu 13.04 amd 64 and I want to change color depth to 32 bit and i tried to change /etc/X11/xorg.conf but i think it didn't work \nplease for help .\nhint : my graphic card is intel G41\n\nA: You don't.\nThere is no such thing as 32-bit colors, at least when it comes to displays. Not even when Microsoft likes to call their 24-bit color mode a \"32-bit\" mode.\n24-bit colors give you 8 bits per color channel, totaling 16,7 million colors (2^8 * 2^8 * 2^8 = ). That's way more than what most LCD displays are able to handle (in fact most consumer-grade LCD panels are really only able to display 18-bit colors)\nPictures and graphics can have 32-bit colors, in which case the last 8 bits are used for Alpha channel (transparency). As long as out displays can't become transparent they have no need for those last 8 bits.\nMore reading see Color depth \nSource:Ubuntu Forums\n", "Q: Do keyboard shortcuts used in Windows work in Ubuntu? As I mentioned in another question, I am thinking of buying a new laptop with Ubuntu pre-installed.\nI share a laptop with my partner who knows much less about computers than me.\nSince the lessons I have given my partner on shortcuts like ctrl-c &  ctrl-v  to copy & paste have really 'stuck', I would like to know if these will still work.\nI am still trying to decide if switching is right thing to do - we are going to try Ubuntu on current laptop first, I think.\n\nA: Ctrl+C, Ctrl+X, Ctrl+V is working right out of the box when installing Ubuntu. The majority of the other shortcuts such as Windows WinKey+E (open file browser), WinKey+D (show desktop) and other can be setup in several ways, of which I suggest the usage of Compiz Config Settings Manager in which you'll find the \"Commands\" Plugin, inside of which you can define your desired commands and their respective key bindings.\nSeveral other useful tools and system configurations can be reached on this site by running a search.\nIf you have need to define a more specific key bindings to certain task don't hesitate to let us know.\nWelcome to AskUbuntu. :) BTW\nGood luck!\nP.S. Compiz Config Settings Manager must be installed in order to be used. This can be easily installed via the Ubuntu Software Center. \n\nA: There are many default common shortcuts with Windows for most Desktop Environments, so ctrl-c & ctrl-v should work by default almost everywhere, but more important is, you can most often reconfigure shortcuts if they don't fit your style. I don't suppose there should be any major problem with that.\n", "Q: how to use mythlink.pl I have been trying to understand how to use mythlink.pl.

I am new to linux, but had a question. I am getting in the business of buying old computers, putting Linux on them, then donating them to students who don't have their own computer at home. I have gone through and installed Xubuntu on my system, installed/uninstalled all the software that I want/need, and now want to know if there is a way that I could make an ISO of my system, and put it onto ANOTHER computer, and still have all of my tweaks, and programs ready to go after the ISO has installed. That way I don't need to go through and spend an hour or two on every computer. \nWhat programs would you recommend for creating an ISO like this? \nThanks,\nTobin\n\nA: Parts of this answer comes from: How to move Ubuntu installation from one hdd to another?\nI can't say an exact answer for the creation of an ISO as you say in your question but if you wish to reduce the amount of time for creating identical copies of an operating system in different computers, the Cloning process can be useful for your case, of which I suggest you the usage of Clonezilla which can be useful for cloning hard disk drives even for those situations on which you need to do it with different size disks as mentioned here: http://www.tuxradar.com/content/how-clone-hard-drives-clonezilla\n\n\nMoving to a bigger disk\nIt's easy to ensure that a clone of a SCSI\n  disk is restored to a SCSI disk, but you'll have a tough time finding\n  an exact replica size-wise. The good news is you don't have to restore\n  a disk on another disk of the same size. The even better news is that\n  you can in fact restore the image to a much larger disk.\nWhen restoring a disk, Clonezilla enables you to resize the filesystem\n  and create partitions on the new disk proportionally. But even if you\n  are moving to a bigger disk, you might prefer to keep the partitions\n  as they are. In that case you can ask Clonezilla to create the\n  partition table as its listed in the image.\n\nThere is documentation about moving to a larger disk but I am not sure that you can do it the opposite (cloning to a smaller disk). That's why I should suggest you to use just the amount of hard disk drive space needed for the install or check which is the smallest hard disk drive of your equipment in order to create the install based on that disk. Let's say: If you have 9 hard disk drives, 2x100GB, 4x80GB 2x40GB and 1x20GB, let's use the smallest one to install and to be the source for cloning so you can clone it in the largest ones. Remember to expand the partitions as needed in order to use the full hard disk drive after cloning.\nClonezilla offers several Live CD's and bootable USB images and there is also documented that you can resize the free space on the disk after the copy, in which case the suggestion to use gparted is also a good idea.\nYou don't need to worry about drivers and possible failures related to these things. Ubuntu will install whatever drivers as needed for the new computer, except the proprietary drivers of certain video cards (ATI/nVidia) or more specific hardware. Based on that I suggest you to check every cloned system in order to make sure that everything is running fine after the cloning.\nBy using a cloning procedure you can do as many customization as you wish to the system and be sure that all the cloned hard disk drives will have the same software that you include on the original.\nGood luck!\n\nA: There is extensive documentation on how to create custom installation CDs. Relevant to your question is this excerpt from that page:\n\nProbably the prime motivation to build your own install CDs is to modify which packages are installed; in particular you may want to add some packages to the CD.\nThe easiest way to do this is to build an 'extras' repository structure, containing only your extra .debs, and merge these into the CD file hierarchy before rebuilding the .ISO image. This guide will step you through how to do this.\n\nI would caution against doing too much customization, preferring to copy /home/tobin/.config and similar files using a simple rsync once the machines are bootstrapped. This suggestion is largely based on the introduction on the instruction page:\n\nThe process of customizing or \"remastering\" Ubuntu installation CDs is not especially complex, but it is a little tedious and finicky.\n\nWhich I read as \"the more clever you try to be, the harder it will to get right\".\n\nA: It might be partly off-topic, but perhaps PXE and kickstart + preseeding with a post-install script could be a safer solution. Some info on kickstart and PXE. At my company I am using kickstart + preseeding for installing VMs on some Xen servers, I have to admit though that I never installed a GUI-enabled host this way. \nThere is an app called system-config-kickstart (available in standard repo for all I know) with which you can browse through most options and easily create a kickstart configuration file. The packages section not working properly, it seems, as apparently not every functionality is ported from RHEL/Fedora yet, but it is still possible to add that section manually to the configuration file.\nThere are also tricks for post-install scripts, like setting up default root passwords for MySQL servers etc., but I suppose we'd need more data in order to help with a specific requirements setup.\nI found surprisingly much data about those topics in 'The Official Ubuntu Server Book' by Kyle Rankin (not trying to advertise in here though).\n\nA: *\n\n*Install Ubuntu (or in your case Xubuntu)\n\n*Install the programs you want & make any other changes you want\n\n*Install Remasterys:\n\n\n-------3a.

I'm running Ubuntu 12.04 LTS on one computer with two monitors.  I've found the place in settings where I can set the \"launcher placement\" and the \"primary\" monitor (using the black bar); however, I can't figure out how to put the launcher on the non-primary monitor.  I want the launcher on the left monitor and my right monitor to be primary.  \nMy reasoning for this is that I want to run a full screen app on the right, primary monitor, while having the launcher available on the left. If I try to set launcher placement to left and primary monitor on right, when I press apply the launcher placement automatically changes to right.\nIs there a way to fix this?  I'm willing to use command line tools if needed.\n\nA: It's quite really simple: go to System Settings... →  Displays, choose Launcher placement and click Apply:\n\n\nNote: click on the images to enlarge.\n\nA: This won't solve your problem completely, but I'm in the same situation as you, and the best thing I've found so far is do the following:\nAssuming your primary screen is the one you don't want fullscreen apps to run on, do:\n\n\n*\n\n*Set your launcher to be on your other screen (not on both), from the Display menu configuration. This will make your primary screen to be the one you want it to be.\n\n*Next, after applying changes set your launcher to be on both screens, then, you'll keep the screen you want as primary one, but you'll be able to use the launcher from the other one.\n\n\nThis is the best I could do, not a complete fix, but it kind of works. Also, if you have the nVidia propietary drivers (or probably, other propietary drivers) you can just switch your primary screen from one monitor to the other, although that will change the placement of your launcher, but it's a little bit faster.\n", "Q: How to find system>administration>OS-uninstaller menu in Gnome?

I am planning on setting up a home media machine with Ubuntu 12.04 LTS or 13.04 (please let me know if this makes a difference).\nI have 4 hard drives and I am looking for a file system that supports raid and will be resistant to one or two hard drive failures. I would prefer to have a file system with the least amount of problems that would lead to lost data or system crashing.\nI have some experience with ZFS on FreeBSD, but I am not sure if zfs on linux is mature enough. Does anyone have any experience or knows a website where I can read up on how the different filesystems compare currently?\n\nA: Traditionally raid is implemented below the filesystem layer, so you can use whatever filesystem you like.  ZFS does it in the filesystem, but is not in a production usable state on Linux.  Btrfs also is trying to do the same, but again, isn't in a production quality state.  mdadm software raid can handle replacing failed disks in redundant configurations ( levels other than 0 ), and can reshape the array between most levels or add and remove disks without data loss.\nIn any case, it is important to remember that raid is no substitute for backups; its purpose is to avoid downtime in the event of disk failure, not protect data from any of the myriad of ways it can be lost.\n\nA: RAID is more a hardware configuration and I do not think it matters what file system you use. Unless you have a specific reason use EXT4. I think it is more important to have backups then use any particular file system.\n", "Q: Is it possible than my user disappears from sudo?

I want to dual-boot Ubuntu with Windows XP until I move the files on Windows to an external drive.\nHowever, when I get to the install section it gives me several options for partitioning/installing. The toolbar above the selection box indicates a section of the  drive in green with sufficient space to install Ubuntu.\nShould I use that part of the disk in order to have space to store Ubuntu files? \n\nA: The first thing you need to do is to find out how much space you need to allocate to the Windows XP partition in order to have enough space for Windows XP, all your stored files on Windows XP and at least 15% extra space.\nIn the Ubuntu installer you will see an Installation type window. Select the first option: Install Ubuntu alongside Windows as shown in the picture below.\n\nNext in the Ubuntu installer you will see an Install Ubuntu alongside Windows window with a slider that you can slide back and forth to allocate drive space between Windows and Ubuntu. You should allocate enough drive space for Ubuntu to include the Ubuntu operating system (at least 5GB, but 10GB would be better) plus enough space to store all the files that you will create and at least 15% extra space. Add these three numbers together, and then slide the slider until you have allocated at least that much space for your Ubuntu install. Once you have allocated the drive space to use for Ubuntu and Windows XP (see picture below), then the Ubuntu installer will create all the partitions that you need automatically.\n\n", "Q: Boot problem ubuntu and windows7 I install ubuntu12.10 than I install windows 7 and now I have access only at windows :(\ni didn't find any solution for this...\ncan you help me please?\nthanks\n\nA: I think you can use EasyBCD to solve it.\nFirst, if you don't have this software, let start Windows, search and download EasyBCD from Web and then install it.\nStart EasyBCD, choose Add New Entry, then tab Linux/BSD\nIn Type, choose GRUB 2\nIn Name, change name (Optional)\nIn Device, choose your Ubuntu's partition\nClick Add Entry.\nThen restart your computer.\nHope it help.\n", "Q: Why does Flash freeze Ubuntu & Firefox?

Once connected, my machine was unable to automatically update DNS setting from the new VPN. I tested by temporarily changing /etc/resolv.conf with the proper nameserver and search domain, and everything worked. This is obviously not a long term solution, so I added an additional DNS server and search domain to the VPN settings in Network manager. With those settings in place, resolvconf does add the search domain, but not the DNS IP, and I still cannot do any lookups. \nWhat is my next step in configuring or troubleshooting from here?\n\nA: Try checking if your /etc/resolv.conf have symbolic link to /run/resolvconf/resolv.conf .

My desktop's ip is 10.42.0.92 while my laptop's ip over ethernet is 10.42.0.1. Any help would be greatly appreciated.\n\nA: There are two ways to share an Internet connection, a proxy server, and NAT.  NAT provides automatic translation of incoming and outgoing data, which makes it easy to deal with the clients to make them work with it\nNAT gives you clear Internet access to all computers in local network and works great with almost any protocol. Using NAT, there's no need to modify settings on each computer.\nThe Proxy Server acts as a client computer at the remote host. Plus it works with only a few protocols that support it.  Proxy has an advantage, since it provides advanced features such as authentication and user based access control.\n", "Q: GParted can't resize logical partitions I have 6 partitions in total.

This forces all programs to rely on the \"python2\" and \"python3\" commands.   \nAlthough some optional and outdated packages depend on #!/usr/bin/python to work, I would rather submit patches to those programs than continue to make weird and sometimes hard-to-debug mistakes.\n\nA: On Ubuntu 20.04+ just install the python-is-python3 package:\nsudo apt install python-is-python3\n\nOn top of that, you can prevent Python 2 from being installed as a dependency of something in the future with apt-mark hold:\nsudo apt-mark hold python2 python2-minimal python2.7 python2.7-minimal libpython2-stdlib libpython2.7-minimal libpython2.7-stdlib \n\n\nA: Ubuntu, and the rest of the Linux distros for that matter, are still largely dependent on Python 2.7 for a number of applications and commands. If you change the default reference of \"python\" to Python 3.x, then a number of Python functions will start throwing assertion errors.\nFor example, on Ubuntu, 'pip' for one would no longer run correctly unless you directly edited the file and changed the shebang to reference '#!/usr/bin/env python2.7'. On RHEL (Red Hat Enterprise Linux) flavors such as Red Hat, Fedora and CentOS, the 'Yum' command is also dependent on Python 2.7.\nMy point here is that you would cause a significant amount of code to start throwing assertion errors just so you could type 'python' in the terminal to reference Python 3.x.\nYou're much better off with using the 'python3' command in the terminal and the shebang '#!/usr/bin/env python3' in your Python 3.x files.\n\nA: [June 2016] The recommended place for information on the transition is official Ubuntu Python page.\n\nFrom the Ubuntu wiki:\n\nFor both Ubuntu and Debian, we have ongoing project goals to make Python 3 the default, preferred Python version in the distros.\nWhat this does not mean:\n  \n  \n*\n  \n*/usr/bin/python will point to Python 3. No, this is not going to happen (unless PEP 394 advocates otherwise, which is doubtful for the foreseeable future). /usr/bin/python and /usr/bin/python2 will point to Python 2.7 and /usr/bin/python3 will point to the latest supported Python 3 version.\n  \n*Python 2 will be removed from the archive. No, this is not going to happen. We expect Python 2.7 to remain supported and available in Ubuntu for quite a long time, given that PEP 373 promises upstream bug fix maintenance support until 2020.\n\nIt is not recommended to change the symbolic link because of other package dependencies, but they \"have ongoing project goals to make Python 3 the default, preferred Python version in the distros\".\n\nFor CLI use, like @Radu Rădeanu, I would recommend putting an alias in the user's ~/.bashrc, .bash_aliases file (the different files, including ~/.bash_profile, are loaded at least once, are mostly for organizational purposes, but may vary by platform). Python virtual environments also work well.\nAlias examples:\nalias python=python3\n\nor \nalias python='/usr/bin/python3'\n\nScripts should still use something like #!/usr/bin/env python3 for cross-compatibility. \nUsing env is nice for mixed use with virtual environments.\nNote (thanks to @wjandrea): aliases are part of the bash runtime, not the user environment. Therefore, they are not available to the shebang (#!). If you prefer the alias python=python3, then some program.py without a shebang could be executed by invoking the aliased interpreter like this python program.py. Aliasing may also be useful for systems with multiple version of python3 like 3.4 and 3.6 together.\n\nA: cat > /usr/local/bin/py << 'EOF'\n#!/bin/dash\npython3 \"$@\"\nEOF\n\n(provided you have write permission to /usr/local/bin)\nlikewise\ncat > /usr/local/bin/pyi << 'EOF'\n#!/bin/dash\npython3 -i \"$@\"\nEOF\n\nthen you only type py (and use py in #! lines) for your chosen python.\n", "Q: Make directory command not working I am new to the Ubuntu.

Now to make any changes to this location you need root permission (although you should not make changes in root(/) directory). You could use super user privileges to make a new folder, by sudo mkdir by assigning you root user privilege after prompting for the password.\n\nA: In Order to use mkdir in namu@ubuntu:/$ you need root rights. So type in the following:\nsudo mkdir file\nafter that type in the password and check with ls -la. Your new directory should show up.\nUpdate:\nNever create files or directories in a root directory!

However, there are good reasons for having separate configuration files for CLI and Apache, not least because a web server is typically an externally facing service. For example:\n\n\n*\n\n*Disabling some extensions to minimise security risks.\n\n*Configuring lower memory limits to limit the potential for denial of service attacks.\n\n\nNote that you can also configure your PHP installation by adding files to /etc/php5/conf.d. This is a good way to keep your customisations in their own file and avoid conflicts in your php.ini file(s) if they get updated by a new version of the packages. The latter point is also an issue if you choose to use symlinks for php.ini. Note that the conf.d directories for cli and apache are symlinks.\n", "Q: How to open a .bat file?

The installation will guide you trough it.\n\n*64, Your CPU can handle 64-bit.\n\n*It has some instructionsets that sometimes improves speed and can handle al lot more ram then 32 bit. (32 bit = 3.5 GB max, 64 bit = 128GB max)\n\n*Yes. If your CPU can do it, your pc can do it. 64 bit even has little to do with speed, its just an instructionset.\n\nA: Just download the iso file, burn it on any dvd or usb media. Then restart your computer from that particular media. You will get option to install ubuntu in different way. If you want replace windows 7 with ubuntu, you need to choose the option \"erase every thing and install ubuntu\". There is lots of other option you can explore them.\nChoosing 64 bit or 32 bit completely depends on you. For normal use they does not differ very much. But since you have 6 GB of ram, I will suggest use 64 bit os.\n64 bit has better speed and it can access more system memory. It has also some other advantages which I don't know completely.\nThe configuration you have provided seems you can easily install ubuntu 64 bit in that system.\n\nA: *\n\n*I recommend to install Ubuntu using the CD or USB installer. For both, you should download the corresponding .ISO file from the Ubuntu Download page and either burn it to DVD (or CD if you have an empty one big enough) or follow the Ubuntu bootable USB guide. I advice against using WUBI, since WUBI will install Ubuntu on the current Windows partition along Windows.\nDuring installation, (at least if everything goes OK) the Ubuntu installer will ask you if you want to install Ubuntu along Windows, or if you want to overwrite Windows.\n\n\n\n*If it works, and on your CPU it probably will, use 64bit. The reason is:\n\n\n*You can expect better performance with 64bit, at the cost of additional RAM usage. Sergey, another askubuntu user, wrote an excellent explanation of the differences between 32bit and 64bit. Also, all 64bit CPUs have SSE, so it is enabled system wide, leading to improved floating point performance compared to the i386 fpu used in older 32bit CPUs. Nevertheless, I think, on Ubuntu also on 32bit SSE is enabled, but honestly I don't know (could someone please edit this answer and add this information? Thanks!).\n\n\n*Usually it should run 64bit.

I realized that when the selections present in the debconf database, the package installer never executes the input commands in the config file. Therefore, I put the purge command in the postrm file.\n\nA: The problem comes from the question priority.\nBy default, the interface will only display question with priority high and critical, you can check this in debconf/priority in file /var/cache/debconf/config.dat\nSo, to have you question displayed, type\ndb_input high foo/like_debian || true\n\ninstead of\ndb_input medium foo/like_debian || true\n\nFrom man debconf:\n\nAnother nice feature of debconf is that the questions it asks you are prioritized. If  you don't want to be bothered about every little thing, you can set up debconf to only ask you the most important questions.  On the other hand, if you are a control freak, you can make it  show  you  all  questions.  Each  question  has  a  priority.  In  increasing order of importance:\n\n*\n\n*low    Very trivial questions that have defaults that will work in the  vast  majority  of  cases.\n\n*medium Normal questions that have reasonable defaults.\n\n*high   Questions that don't have a reasonable default.\n\n*critical   Questions that you really, really need to see (or else).\n\n\n", "Q: How to add \"open jdk7\" to deffault open program list? I want to open a .jar file, but \"open jdk 7\" is not in other applications list. How can I add \"open jdk 7\" to \"other applications\" list and then set it as default opener?\nI have no such problem in ubuntu 12.04 but in 13.04 I can not set \"open jdk 7\" as default. I have to right click on .jar file and select open with \"open jdk7\" every time that is annoying.\n\nA: Here's the answer: How do I reenable opening jar files by double clicking on them?\nCheck that answer.\nIn short, you have to edit the file /usr/share/applications/defaults.list as root (sudo gedit /usr/share/applications/defaults.list, for example), \nsearch for the two lines that start with application/x-jar and application/x-java-archive and change the .desktop values of those lines to openjdk-7-java.desktop, if you have openjdk-7 installed.\n\nA: *\n\n*Right click on .JAR file\n\n*Click \"Open with...\"\n\n*Click \"Custom command line\"\n\n*Type in the text field: java -jar\n\n*Click the checkbox \"Set as default action for this file type\"\n\n*Click \"OK\"\n\n\nThe .JAR should start now. From then on, you can just double click the .JAR to start it.\n", "Q: Locate name doesn't work There is a file at /user/share/jogl.jar. \nI am using locate jogl.jar\nbut it doesn't work. Why?\n\nA: From the man page:\n   locate  reads  one or more databases prepared by updatedb(8) and writes\n   file names matching at least one of the PATTERNs  to  standard  output,\n   one per line.\n\nRun updatedb as root and try again. It should work.\nAlternatively you can use find or find | grep, which does not uses a db (and thus is considerably slower).\n\nA: What do you mean by \"it doesn't work\" ?  Two main issues come to mind, if you're not familiar with locate, both related to the fact that locate relies on a database and not directly on the file system.\n\n\n*\n\n*It doesn't display any result: in this case, you might need update locate's database by simply running updatedb from a terminal\n\n*It returns way too many results: once again, locate uses a database, not the current directory (contrary to several other common unix commands), so if you try to locate somestuff from your home directory in order to find all the somestuff that it might contain, it won't work.  You'll have to run it with the full path instead: locate ~/*somestuff\n\nA: For some reason, Ubuntu didn't add me, as a user, to the group that's allowed to read the default database. The solution was:\nsudo usermod -a -G mlocate YOUR_USER_NAME\n\nThis information was learned by reading man updatedb and examining the permissions of the default db in /var/lib/mlocate/mlocate.db.\n", "Q: Google query from terminal Is there a way to launch a google query from the terminal? Like starting up google (as in firefox www.google.com) but with a search query? It would be nice to not have to install any extra programs and have single command to do this.\n\nA: You can add next function in your ~/.bashrc file:\nfunction google { \n     Q=\"$@\"; \n     GOOG_URL='https://www.google.com/search?q=';\n     stream=$(exo-open \"${GOOG_URL}${Q//\\ /+}\" | grep -oP '\\/url\\?q=.+?&amp' | sed 's|/url?q=||; s|&amp||'); \n     echo -e \"${stream//\\%/\\x}\"; \n}\n\nNext, when you open a terminal you can run:\ngoogle query to search\n\nor\ngoogle query to search &\n\nto open in background your default browser at www.google.com including the search query.\n\nA: browser google.com/search?q=query\n\nWhere browser is the desired web browser.\n\nA: Here is a little script I use for exactly that with chrome:\n#!/bin/bash -\n\nFLAG=\"-i\"\nINCOG=\"\"\n\nif [ x\"$1\" == x\"$FLAG\" ]\nthen\n        INCOG=\"--incognito\"\n        shift\nfi\n\n\nQUERY=$(echo \"$*\" | sed 's/+/%2b/g' | sed 's/#/%23/g' | tr -s ' ' '+')\n\nnohup /opt/google/chrome/google-chrome $INCOG \\-url www.google.com\\/search\\?sourceid\\=chrome\\&ie\\=UTF\\-8\\&q\\=$QUERY > /dev/null 2>&1 &\nexit\n\nI've included some html character replacement for  # and + so I can search for c# and c++ when I need to - more could easily be added to suit your needs. I also have a -i option for the script to launch in incognito mode. I'm sure this could be adapted to firefox, but I don't use firefox.\n", "Q: Is it possible to install Ubuntu directly from and to the HDD? I live a long way from stores. I'm in rural Eastern Cape South Africa. I downloaded Ubuntu but I don't have any blank DVD's. Can I copy it to my HDD and install from there?\n\nA: You can install from a hard drive, as long as it's not the hard drive you're installing Ubuntu in (you need a spare/external one).\nThe answers to this questions explain how.\nYou can also use a flashdrive.\n\nA: Well, yes, it's possible. Yet it is quite a bit easier to use a DVD or USB pen drive. So, if you want to have the \"simply works\" experience you might expect from Ubuntu, try to get a DVD-R or a USB pen drive.\nIf you are still motivated to try the HDD boot method, read the documentation for the alternate CD, at least the parts about installing from HDD. Since it's a guide for the alternate CD, it might be worth to also download the alternate CD instead of the normal Live-CD, to ensure that everything works as described.\n", "Q: How to remove password recovery reset? How can I remove the ability to reset passwords outside of Ubuntu.  This probably is ill advised, but I already have set a really good password that I cannot forget with high entropy and 42 characters.  I think that it is great that Ubuntu can so easily reset a password, but it seems like a big security risk.  (I know you can edit grub, but anyone that knows anything about Linux will just edit the boot command and boot into recovery anyway.)  Thanks in advance.\n\nA: Disable the recovery mode by uncommenting the line:\n#GRUB_DISABLE_RECOVERY=\"true\"\n\nin /etc/default/grub (and running sudo update-grub afterwards), and password protect grub menu entry.\n\nA: The only way to be sure is to encrypt the disk.  Short of that, you have to physically secure the machine so that someone can not remove the HD and plug it into another machine or boot the machine from removable media.  Only then does locking down grub do any good.\n\nA: The best way to protect your installation is to apply all the above fixes and lock the PC into a box with ventilation in a room that only you have a key to.\n", "Q: kernel panic error in ubuntu 12.10 Before installing xen hypervisor my ubuntu 12.10 was working fine, but after installing xen I am unable to boot my ubuntu.

While trying to install Ubuntu with the Windows installer it's starting to download a file, but it stops downloading at about 45%. Please guide me through the troubleshooting.\n\nA: If you want to install Wubi for running Ubuntu in Windows, then install Ubuntu 12.04 because Wubi is not supported for Ubuntu 13.04. Also Ubuntu 12.04 has the advantage of being a Long Term Support release that is supported by updates until April, 2017. The Windows installer for Wubi, called wubi.exe, is a 2.4MB file that you can download from the ubuntu.com website.\n", "Q: How to reinstall Ubuntu linux 12.04, after I reinstalled windows 7 I had Ubuntu and Windows both on my pc.

I could not install my modem driver so I have to update and install applications offline. For this I want to use keryx but to install keryx, Python and wxPython have to be installed first. So how do I install Python and wxPython offiline on Ubuntu 13.04?\nNote : I don't have internet connection in Ubuntu. So I'll have to download the required file from my Windows 7. \n\nA: Generally, installing packages offline is well... drama. You can download the .deb files from http://packages.ubuntu.com/raring, but you have to be very careful. You should  also download and install all dependencies, which can be tens and even hundreds for some packages. Normally, sudo apt-get install [package_name] does this all for you automatically, but doing it manually is a hell of a job.\nThat said: Base Python is installed by default on Ubuntu. \nwxPython is downloadable here, but be sure to first download and install all dependencies.\n", "Q: Why are the VLC shortcuts (stop/previous/next) greyed out in the tray? When I run VLC, an icon appears in the tray.  When I click this icon, it pops a dropdown list containing shortcuts (hide vlc, play, stop, previous, next, speed, ...).\nBut the stop, previous and next are greyed out.  \nNote that I'm right in the middle of a playlist and that the other shortcuts (buttons on the VLC player) works fine.\nAny idea why ?\n\nA: You are using an app indicator for vlc provided by the sni-qt package, not a systray vlc icon. The reason that those buttons are greyed out is because they don't work.\nOverall the indicator for vlc is pretty poor & has been that way ever since sni-qt came out. No one has fixed it so it remains just as you've seen for the last 2 years..\n", "Q: Minify tool that can be executed through terminal I am looking for a tool or a way to minify (similar to Compress my code and this question on Stack) all of the code in my .xml, .css, .html and .js files through Ubuntu's terminal.  Eventually I will bash script the process, but at the moment I would like to just find something to test.  Is there a tool out there that I can use to compress all these file formats through the terminal?\n\nA: This is not the best option but it's probably the easiest. The YUI compressor was long thought to be the best compressor for Javascript and CSS, offering 20-40% improvements over other minifiers.\nIt has since been superseded by newer projects like Uglify.JS (which Grunt will probably suggest) but it's still a fairly easy thing to get up and running in Ubuntu.\nsudo apt-get install yui-compressor\n\nThat's it. Now you can run yui-compressor myfile.js and it'll do its magic, just not as well, or as conveniently as a properly install Node/Grunt/Uglify+YUI stack.\n\nA: JavaScript Minifier is a Online JavaScript Minifier project by Andrew Chilton. Free, decent and no installation needed\ncurl -X POST -s --data-urlencode 'input@my.js' https://javascript-minifier.com/raw > my.min.js\n\n\nA: You can minify js easily with node and uglify-js from command line:\n\n\n*\n\n*install uglify-js with npm install uglify-js -g\n\n*run it uglifyjs app-test.js > app-test.min.js\n\nFor css I would suggest clean-css (probably the most stable css minifier on npm)\nexample usage:\ncleancss -o public-min.css public.css\n\n\nAs far as html is concerned usually minification is not usually worth the time you invest in setting it up, but I have tried html-minifier and it's an awesome tool.\nWhatever you do just be sure that you gzip what you're serving.\n\nEdit 05-03-2020\nNowadays, instead of using uglify-js, js developers usually use terser.\n\nA: There is no reason to minify php files (except you have very limited disk space and want to use every bit of it). \nIf you could add a goal (What do you want to accomplish and why?), somebody might show you a better way.\nJS and CSS files are minified on runtime and cached in most webprojects. There is minify (https://github.com/mrclay/minify), a php \"library\" which is able to do exactly this. (can also be executed with php from the terminal)\nBut keep in mind that one big javascript file does not necessary load faster than 5 small files. If you need a reason and a solution for this statement, take a look at http://headjs.com/\nMay the source be with you...\n\nA: I have had good results with Closure Compiler.\n\nThe Closure Compiler is a tool for making JavaScript download and run\n  faster. Instead of compiling from a source language to machine code, it\n  compiles from JavaScript to better JavaScript. It parses your JavaScript,\n  analyzes it, removes dead code and rewrites and minimizes what's left. It\n  also checks syntax, variable references, and types, and warns about common\n  JavaScript pitfalls.\n\nIt’s developed by Google and written in Java. It’s packaged for Debian-based systems as closure-compiler and is easily installed on Ubuntu systems.  As it doesn’t use a GUI, it requires the more lightweight default-jre-headless package.\nIt’s slower that YUI compressor but the resulting filesize is (slightly) smaller. It also prints useful warning messages, similar to compilers for other programming languages.\nDocumentation: Getting started\nUsage: \nclosure-compiler --js input.js --js_output_file output.js\n\n\nA: Use minify - unlike the other suggestions, this tool minifies a lot more file types:\nCSS     text/css\nHTM     text/html\nHTML    text/html\nJS      text/javascript\nJSON    application/json\nSVG     image/svg+xml\nXML     text/xml\n\n\nA: I would recommend using Grunt.js. It's an automation tool that has minifiers available as plugins and can be run in your terminal via Node.js. It should not be necessary to minify PHP as the code executes on the server side and only its HTML output is sent to the client.\nYou can find available plugins here\n\nA: Another option is to use npx command from Node.js. npx runs a command of a Node.js package without installing it explicitly.\n# Minify JS\nnpx -p uglify-js uglifyjs -o app.min.js app.js common.js\n\n# Minify CSS\nnpx clean-css-cli -o style.min.css css/bootstrap.css style.css\n\n# Minify HTML\nnpx html-minifier index-2.html -o index.html --remove-comments --collapse-whitespace\n\n# XML\nnpx pretty-data-cli --type xml --minify input.xml > input.min.xml\n\n\nA: I found this java library for HTML (you need to have java installed):\nhttps://code.google.com/archive/p/htmlcompressor/\nCommand line usage is simple:\njava -jar htmlcompressor.jar inputfile.html > outputfile.html\n\nAnd for CSS I use this (better compression rates than other tools that I've tried):\nhttps://github.com/acwtools/accss\nCommand line usage:\naccss inputfile.css > outputfile.css\n\n", "Q: How to use the default calendar indicator more effectively in 13.04 How to sync all my calendar events to the calendar indicator in ubuntu 13.04?\nI have got a calendar indicator on my panel next to volume but it never shows any of my events.\nI have got thunderbird installed and have synced my google calendar with it. \nIs that the default calendar in 13.04? \n\nA: Note: This answer outlines how to use Thunderbird Lightning and synchronize that with your Ubuntu (11-14 so far!).

Why it is used? I need to know the extensions of xzf and its usage. Is it necessarily to be used in installing a software?\nsudo tar -xzf utorrent-server-3.0-ubuntu-10.10-27079.tar.gz\n\nWhy this is used?\n\nA: tar is the Swiss army knife of extracting archives. It can handle many different archives, such as tar.gz, tar.xz, tar.bz, tar.bz2, tar.lz... \nYour command contains the following three options:\n\n\n*\n\n*-x = extract\n\n*-z = gzipped archive\n\n*-f = get from a file, not a tape drive \n\n\nTo find more help on tar, enter tar --help or man tar in your terminal.\nSo your command extracts the archive utorrent-server-3.0-ubuntu-10.10-27079.tar.gz to a directory. It does not install the utorrent server, unlike dpkg -i or sudo apt-get install.\ntar archives for programs typically contain Linux binaries, which you can run with './ binary-name'. \n\nA: tar is basically The GNU version of the tar archiving utility\nfor more information on tar go to the terminal and type man tar.\nYou will find out what exactly xzf is used for. Basically they flags (options) when you run a tar command.\n[-]x --extract --get:\n-z --gzip:\n-f --file F:\n\nThe order of this command does matter though.\nBasically your command \nsudo tar -xzf utorrent-server-3.0-ubuntu-10.10-27079.tar.gz\n\nwill extract the tar.gz archive that you specify as (utorrent-server-3.0-ubuntu-10.10-27079.tar.gz) as root privileges. \n\nA: The other answers provided are quite good, but I would like to give an example and explain more of why it is used for installations.\nFirst of all, like the others have explained. tar -xzf is just a method for extracting. In installation instructions they will usually tell you the options to use since different options will be required for different archive types. \nEXAMPLE USAGE-- TAKEN FROM HERE \nExtract a gzipped tar archive ( *.tar.gz ) using option xvzf\nUse the option z for uncompressing a gzip tar archive.\n$ tar xvfz archive_name.tar.gz\n\nExtracting a bzipped tar archive ( *.tar.bz2 ) using option xvjf\nUse the option j for uncompressing a bzip2 tar archive.\n$ tar xvfj archive_name.tar.bz2\n\n\nEXAMPLE INSTALLATION - GOOGLE DROPBOX\nNow as for why this is used in Ubuntu installations, consider the Google DropBox installation process found here. \nIt says to install, do the following:\n64-bit:\n\ncd ~ && wget -O - \"https://www.dropbox.com/download?plat=lnx.x86_64\" | tar xzf -\n\nNext, run the Dropbox daemon from the newly created .dropbox-dist folder.\n\n~/.dropbox-dist/dropboxd\n\nWhat these instructions are telling you is:\n\n\n*\n\n*Navigate to user home directory ~\n\n*Download the tar file\n\n*Unzip it in the home directory. This will create the folder .dropbox-dist because of how the zip was made.\n\n*Run the program in the newly unzipped folder.\n\nUBUNTU INSTALLATIONS\nSee Ubuntu doesn't work like Windows. In Windows you need to run executable installation programs to configure the registry, the directories, file associations, etc. etc. Ubuntu is very component-ized--that is to say that it is exceptionally rare that any system configuration files need to be changed for an application to be installed. For the most part all that needs to happen is that a few files need to be put in special folders like /var/, /usr/share/applications/, /etc/, and /bin/, (possibly others) which can be done by a batch installation file (like the dropboxd file) with adequate (sudo) privileges. Though this is not necessarily the case-- some programs are completely self contained and don't need to have their files put in special directories. As such, upon untarring/unzipping the files, the installation may already be complete.\nIt's very different than a Windows installation where system tries to manage everything with a registry-- the important thing is that files are present in specific directories and the system will search those directories as it needs them. If it finds them, good they are installed, and if it doesn't, well it's probably not installed and the system will not even notice (this only goes for non-essential system components). This is why, some programs can be installed without running a batch file or anything.\n\nA: -xzf are arguments to the tar command.

I know nothing about the structuring of the HD. I have the windows 2000 full installation disk and the Windows vista upgrade disk. I do not have a recovery disk cause my son didn't make one before uninstalling windows and putting Ubuntu on. \nI believe it was due to windows crashing that he went to Ubuntu. I am using Ubuntu 12.04.\n\nA: If it is just that specific program that you are switching back to windows for, have you tried installing 'wine' in Ubuntu and running it on there? Wine tries to emulate Windows so you can run (some) Windows programs, so it might be worth a try if you wanted.\nAs far as removing Ubuntu and installing Windows, the general procedure is to insert the Windows disc at startup and then you should get on screen instructions on installing Windows. As far as where Windows would install (by the sounds of it you are looking to install over Ubuntu) I do not know the options available during Windows setup, I believe this is a question better answered on a Windows forum.\n", "Q: How to get Ubuntu to stop heating up so much I already have another post on how to control the fans, but I was wondering if I am doing anything to cause this.  Ubuntu is running great at the beginning but after about twenty minutes of running temp goes from about 110 degrees F to 190 degrees F.\nEven if I quit all programs the temp stays at the higher temp.\nI have checked process list and nothing seems out of the ordinary.  The main programs that I run before this happens are Clementine, Firefox Nightly, Cairo-Dock (no OpenGL), and Gnome-System-Monitor.\nThe only thing that I have found to help is to reboot.\nThen I start the process all over again.  By the way, I have a laptop cooler that it is also on.  I'm pretty sure it would overheat on me if I didn't have that.  I have had it get hot so far but I think the max temp is 225 degrees F.  I'm not too worried but it would be nice to have an answer.\nUbuntu (13.04)  GNOME Shell 3.6.3.1\n Fujitsu Lifebook AH530\n\nA: You may try to reduce load indeed. Start with tools like top or htop to determine which processes are straining the netbook the most and decide if all of them are necessary (some unnecessary or unwanted services are turned on by default). A more detailed answer could come if you post more info on culprits of (possible) high load.\nAre you sure though that the OS is the cause of this? I didn't work with this particular model, but apparently according to reviewers at Amazon it frequently overheats. I don't think help with hardware is on topic in here and possible solutions depend very much on whether the machine is still within the vendor warranty period (as I guess you would not like to void the warranty).\n\nA: On my experience, default setup of Ubuntu is very powerfull, but it is tweaked at performance. You can do some steps going the powersafe direction described here (Heating issues and Fan sound on Dell Inspiron 3521 running Ubuntu 13.04)\n\nA: I have an Inspiron 14z with a Core i7 processor. I installed Ubuntu 12.04 in December 2012. It first ran fine. Later, however, it started crashing once per month, later once per week, and finally 2 times per day.\nHow to diagnose/solve the problem:\nWay A:\nOn cold start, go to DELL diagnostics. When I ran those, my system crashed but before it did it displayed a note that the system is reaching a temperature of 100C and gave an error message. I searched that error message and DELL said:\n\n*\n\n*Replace the fan, and\n\n*Update the BIOS.\n\nI did both.\nWay B:\nInstall psensor. Start psensor. Install a utility called “stress” on Ubuntu. Start it by stress -c <number of cpu you have>.  Watch the psensor. The good behavior is that the CPU utilization goes to 100% immediately, then the temp increases in form of 1 – e^(-t/T), which is a curve that looks like a charging capacitor. Just before it hits the maximum temperature, your CPU can handle (for Inspiron 14z it is 100C), then Ubuntu will reduce the frequency, which will reduce the temperature. The shape of the temperature looks like e^(-t/T), meaning like a discharging capacitor. If Ubuntu does it's job, you should observe this charging/discharging cycle every few minutes. If your cooling hardware is bad, then it will crash. If Ubuntu driver is not doing the right job, the computer will crash.\n\nA: I've had this problem, when I close Clementine on the Desktop, it still runs in the background overheating the CPU.  I have to open a terminal and kill the application. Perhaps that will help you also. I don't know a permanent fix for this.\n\nA: This worked for me, Controlling the CPU usage cooled the system down. \nIs there a way to autostart CPULIMIT in order to reduce excessive CPU consumption\nAlso this is a good post:\nWays to keep your laptop cool\n", "Q: Why does my Linux version name read Linaro instead of Xubuntu and how can I fix it?

I guess, that this change come when I changed stable kernel to current kernel, when my kernel was in conflict with extended nvidia driver. Everything else works well.. so it is not a big issue, just weird.\nI thought that Linaro distribution is targeted to ARM processors. How this distribution name come to me I do not know.

But I have no other troubles, than misfunctional software center, so it is not seriously messed up. \n\nA: You have the Linaro overlay PPA (ppa:linaro-maintainers/overlay) installed, which supplies a replacement base-files package, which has replaced your system's reported distribution name with Linaro.\nIf you want to install only specific packages from the overlay for purposes unrelated to the overlay's purpose, you can use apt pinning to prevent automatic upgrades to packages from the PPA. For example: you could create a file called /etc/apt/preferences.d/linaro-overlay-pin with the following contents: \nPackage: *\nPin: release o=LP-PPA-linaro-maintainers-overlay\nPin-Priority: 400\n\nThis will stop packages automatically upgrading when the PPA supplies more recent version numbers for them. Then you can install the packages from the PPA that you specifically want by specifying their version numbers:\nsudo apt-get install foo=1.2-1\n\nBut since you've already upgraded base-files from the PPA without pinning, I'm not sure what else you might have upgraded, and what you'll need to downgrade manually.\n\nA: It was enough to edit /etc/lsb-release to its original content:\n DISTRIB_ID=Ubuntu\n DISTRIB_RELEASE=12.04\n DISTRIB_CODENAME=precise\n DISTRIB_DESCRIPTION=\"Xubuntu 12.04\"\n\nAnd sudo apt-get dist-upgrade went finally ok. I always omit to touch it as the computer should work on daily basis. This was my last try prior to decision of re-install or attempt to fix it. So it was finally fixed so so easy.\n", "Q: Wine + Lotro + Bumblebee So here is my strange problem. (If this goes outside of the realm of Ubuntu let me know)\nI recently purchased a new Samsung Series 7 Chronos which uses the Nvidia Optimus technology.\nI have installed Bumblebee and also added the Bumblebee indicator.\nBeing a Lord of the Rings Online player, I installed Wine (1.5), and PyLotro (Windows version since Linux native no longer works with latest update).\nThe odd thing is that, when I use Bumblebee indicator, or optirun to start Lotro using PyLotro, the output box only says '*FINISHED*' without any other details and it won't run.\nHowever, if I run PyLotro outside of bumblebee, it gives me lots of output and just starts the game.\nAnyone have any ideas how I can get this to work through my NVidia card?\nThanks\n\nA: For those who encounter the same issue (whether using Lotro or not), this is how I was able to get it running.\nFirst, you will need to install primus.\nThis is in the Bumblebee PPA, so if you are using that then skip the following command.\nTo add the PPA, open the terminal and enter the following command:\nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:bumblebee/stable\nsudo apt-get update\n\nOnce you have added the PPA, install Primus using the following command:\nsudo apt-get install primus\n\nIf you have a 64bit system (likely), they you also want to use this command:\nsudo apt-get install primus-libs-ia32:i386\n\nJust like with optirun (Bumblebee), Primus uses primusrun.\nTo be technical, here is a quote to explain the difference between the two:\n\nBumblebee uses VirtualGL to copy the image generated by the second (faster) GPU to your display. VirtualGL was intended for use over a network though, so it takes a great many steps to enable this (compression, sending the image over a network link, decompression, etc).\nPrimus doesn't perform all these \"extra\" steps, instead taking a more direct route (copying the rendered image in memory to the other GPU, then displaying there). In theory this should get you better performance as well as better compatibility. Running applications will \"see\" the OpenGL implementation of your real hardware, nothing virtual is presented to them.\n\nThe next step I took was to use the Windows version of PyLotro, since the Riders of Rohan update caused issues with the Linux native PyLotro app.\nI set up windowed mode, and started PyLotro with the command 'primusrun wine pylotro.exe'.\nThis started Pylotro as it had done in the past, but once I clicked to log in, instead of getting the annoying 'FINISHED' message, it started the game and the problem was gone.\nSo, if you have problems running Wine apps through optirun, I recommend trying primusrun, as it seems to work a little better.\n(The solution found was thanks to webupd8, see the page here: WebUpd8 Primus Page)\n", "Q: Why doesn't the bootable USB show up in the BIOS? I followed all the instructions on the Ubuntu website as to how to install Ubuntu using a bootable USB.

Is there an easy way to find out if I should run a program with primusrun? For example - Wolfram Mathematica - it can do without it but what if it runs smoother with it?\nWould it be bad to always use primusrun, as bumblebee's purpose, if I'm understanding it correctly, is to actively select when to use the GPU? Shouldn't it not matter, then, in terms of energy consumption, if every program I run, graphics-intensive or not, uses primusrun?\nIn other words, is there a programtical way of seeing whether a program uses OpenGL? Can this be utilized to make the command if [ uses opengl x ]; primusrun x; else x; run every time I run an application?\n\nA: According to the Wiki from the Bumblebee project, Bumblebee is designed to allow you to switch when you need it. From what I read, it is purely for energy saving. So basically, if you had the option in your BIOS, you could run NVidia graphics alone, but it's not very efficient.\nSo in short, you can use it whenever you feel you need extra graphical power and are willing to sacrifice a little extra energy for it\n", "Q: No installer in ISO I have downloaded ubuntu 13.04 and installed all the needed softwares , java , browsers and customized as I required and I made a iso with Remastersys software .

I have already installed Ubuntu and am trying to partition my hdd for Windows but it wont allow me. I attached a picture of my current hdd setup. The sda5 option and the sda2 option won't let edit it. Does any one know how I can do this?\n\nA: Before you do anything you should backup any important files.\nYou probably cant edit the sda5 and the sda2 partition because they are in use by Ubuntu. You should make a Gparted live CD or USB stick and boot to it. You then will be able to edit all of the partitions on your hard-drive.

When I started researching how to get Netflix to work with Ubuntu everything I saw pointed me to the Netflix-Desktop app. When I looked in to this app, it seemed to me (a relative novice) that it was just Wine with Firefox and Silverlight installed. However, I tried installing FireFox and Silverlight in Wine and Netflix does not work. \nSo is there some magic going on in Netflix-desktop that I don't understand, or maybe I'm just missing something?\nI know there are a million questions about Netflix on Ubuntu, but none of them seem to exlpain much. They just say \"Install Netflix-Desktop\" which is fine, but I would like to understand a little more.\nThanks\n\nA: netflix-desktop is Firefox with Wine installed in its own prefix. Installing Silverlight into wine does not do anything unless you are using Silverlight in the same prefix as a Windows version of Firefox has been installed in previously, as Silverlight on Wine will not function with the Ubuntu version of Firefox. Personally, I will say that netflix-desktop is a good way to go as it packages both firefox and wine and works great. Hope that helps!\n\nA: Yes, there are a few patches in wine-compholio that isn't in vanilla wine yet. That's the biggest difference, but he's also customized Firefox slightly in order to make it work slightly better with Ubuntu desktop. \n", "Q: How can I revert ubuntu settings after gnome-shell install I have Ubuntu 13.04 32 bit. Recently, I installed Gnome 3 because I wanted to try something new. It looked and felt awful, so I removed it via ppa-purge. \nUnfortunately, some of my setting were altered by Gnome 3 which are mainly cosmetic but nonetheless annoying. Some examples:\n- \"Lock/Switch Account\" in the upper right menu does not show the beautiful Unity lock screen any more but an ugly white box\n- The GRUB bootloader screen is now blue\n- When booting Ubuntu, the standard Gnome Wallpaper appears before lightdm shows\n- Window title font looks different now\nDoes someone know how I get back to a clean Unity?\n\nA: Make sure you run ppa-purge first like so (assuming you added the standard Gnome team PPA.  You also need to do this for every PPA you installed.  Do this before uninstalling the packages.\nppa-purge ppa:gnome3-team/gnome3\n\nThen remove all of the gnome related stuff (if it's installed):\nsudo apt-get remove --purge gnome-shell \nsudo apt-get remove --purge ubuntu-gnome-desktop \nsudo apt-get remove --purge ubuntu-gnome-default-settings \nsudo apt-get remove --purge gnome-tweak-tool\n\nThen run\nunity --reset\nunity --reset-icons\n\nThat should take care of it.\nOn a purely personal note, you may want to give Gnome 3 a try for a little longer and just read through the keyboard operations (especially the \"Windows\" key) and the available Gnome extensions.  It is a truly amazing work of UI engineering and design, fine-tuned for efficiency and customization.  The appearance can be micro-managed to be perfectly you.

Let's untangle the confused discussion. There are two problems here: (i) access and (ii) permissions on the server.\n\n\n*\n\n*FTP vs SFTP. Although the names are similar and both \"things\" look very much alike, these two ways of accessing your server are handled by two very different programs. \n\n\n*\n\n*FTP is run by an FTP server; it is both old and simple\n\n*SFTP on the other hand is run by an SSH server and over an SSH connection. It is more versatile and more secure. You will be well advised to access your web server using SSH/SFTP.\n\n*you can use SSH both to connect directly to the server, log in and run commands, as well as run SFTP just for transferring the files. Heck, you can even mount the server like a network drive using SSH!\n\n\n*Testing the SFTP connection. If you can log in as simon, you should be able to transfer files to and from /tmp and /home/simon.

Open a terminal, and type\nssh simon@localserver\n\nEnter password, log in and try to create and modify files, and look who the files belong to:\ntouch /tmp/test\ntouch /var/www/test\nls -l /var/www\n\n", "Q: Ubuntu Server - Games?

Does this mean that I can run 64 on a 64 cpu without problems, please advise.\n\nA: 64 bit now recommended?\nIt is not not recommended anymore. The website probably got tweaked but could already have been changed for 12.10. Seems someone got annoyed by it and changed the website...\nDoes this mean that I can run 64 on a 64 cpu without problems, please advise?\nAs far as I am aware you could always run it. The 32bit version of Ubuntu will run on a 32bit CPU and a 64bit CPU. The 64bit version of Ubuntu will run on a 64bit CPU. It was recommended for users who would not know or care about the difference. But the change to multiarch was a big improvement.\n\nMultiarch is a new approach to running programs compiled for one computer architecture on another, particular i386<->amd64 (see 32bit and 64bit for an explanation to these two architectures). If Ubuntu is working, you should not have to concern yourself with the details of how it supports different computer architectures; just install the programs you like.\nMultiarch lets you install library packages from multiple architectures on the same machine. This is useful in various ways, but the most common is installing both 64 and 32-bit software on the same machine and having dependencies correctly resolved automatically. In general you can have libraries of more than one architecture installed together and applications from one architecture or another installed as alternatives. Note that it does not enable multiple architecture versions of applications to be installed simultaneously.\n\n", "Q: Chrome/Chromium login problem I'm using ubuntu 13.04 and I love it \nBut there's a little problem with browsers,I both tried chrome and chromium browsers but I cant login my google account for sync bookmarks etc.\nI already searched problem on google but couldnt find a solution .\nPs: I already tried clear cookies ( with clean browser lol)\nThanks everyone\n\nA: Step 1.)

I would like to be able to use juju on a shared remote machine (ie: nitrous.io or c9.io). Is that possible?  And if so, how would you do it?\n\nA: If you're referring to using the juju client commands (IE, juju deploy, juju bootstrap, etc) None of those commands require sudo at the moment. The new \"local\" provider for juju will require sudo power, but that's only if you're doing a local LXC deployment.\nOn the remote side of things, the juju-agent does require and run as root.\nI'm not entirely sure how either part of juju would fit in to the shared machine model of c9.io or nitrous.io (Are you going to have those IDEs drive Juju?). If you're looking for integration points with those services, the juju client is set up in such a way that you can do that (have a unique $JUJU_HOME for each user where they can maintain their own environments.yaml, etc). I haven't attempted integration personally but it there shouldn't be too much to change in order to do so.\nIf you're trying to deploy services to a shared machine as a regular user that likely will not work.\n", "Q: Can I lower soundcard quality?

In fact, using efibootmgr on a Mac is unlikely to have any desirable result, since Macs are weird in how they manage boot programs.\nInstead, you need to manage your boot entries in one of the ways that rEFInd supports, such as:\n\n\n*\n\n*Deleting unwanted boot loader programs from the hard disk.\n\n*Using the dont_scan_volumes, dont_scan_dirs, or dont_scan_files options in refind.conf to blacklist specific partitions, directories, or filenames from rEFInd's auto-detection.\n\n*Deleting filesystem drivers to prevent rEFInd from scanning particular partitions.\n\n*Adjusting the scanfor line in refind.conf to prevent scanning for certain broad classes of boot programs, such as BIOS-mode boot loaders (by removing hdbios from the list).\n\n*Using dd to delete BIOS boot loaders from specific partitions or from the hard disk's MBR. This method is potentially dangerous, though.\n\n\nChances are one of the first two or three options will do what you want to do, but it's not clear from your description which one will work best for your situation. For instance, if you've deleted Manjaro or Ubuntu completely but still see boot options for them, chances are you've got leftover boot loaders for these OSes in the EFI System Partition (ESP), and deleting those files may be in order. OTOH, if you're seeing entries for an OS that you're booting in some other way, perhaps one of the dont_scan options would work better.\nNote that in some cases rEFInd will produce multiple entries for one distribution, and these should not be trimmed. The reason is that rEFInd may detect multiple kernels. You can see the exact filename beneath the icon when you highlight an entry. If the filenames take the form vmlinuz-{version} but differ in their version numbers, this is what you're seeing. You should keep such multiple entries because sometimes a new kernel doesn't work properly, and having multiple kernels can therefore provide a fallback in case a new one doesn't work. If all your kernels work, you can get rid of older entries by uninstalling the older kernel package with dpkg, apt-get, synaptic, or some other tool. That's a variant on the first option. Just be sure that whatever's left actually boots successfully.\n\nA: I'm having this same issue except I have Manjaro installed and removed Solus from a separate drive in my system. Refind still offers an entry for Solus as an option even though I thought I deleted the pertinent files from the EFI folder. \n", "Q: Delay an application at /etc/xdg/startup For some reason when it's started too quickly when it's active it shows my desktop instead of overlaying on the active windows.I have guake.desktop in /etc/xdg/startup and I'm wondering if there's a way to delay it's startup by a few seconds?\n[Desktop Entry]\nName=Guake Terminal\nName[pt]=Guake Terminal\nName[pt_BR]=Guake Terminal\nComment=Use the command line in a Quake-like terminal\nComment[pt]=Utilizar a linha de comando em um terminal estilo Quake\nComment[pt_BR]=Utilizar a linha de comando em um terminal estilo Quake\nTryExec=guake\nExec=guake\nIcon=/usr/share/pixmaps/guake/guake.png\nType=Application\nCategories=GNOME;GTK;Utility;TerminalEmulator;\nStartupNotify=true\nX-GNOME-Autostart-enabled=false\n\n\nA: Typically to delay a .desktop that is autostarted you'd add a line like this, example here of 4 sec's\nX-GNOME-Autostart-Delay=4\n\nJust to note, the .desktop you posted above has X-GNOME-Autostart-enabled=false so it shouldn't be autostarting quake.

When i switched to static it went away (but making it static took some trickery because for whatever reason if i clicked add it wouldn't let me save the config).  I would suggest running in static and make sure you dont have an address saved in your router for that MAC address.  I am by all definitions a noob but it worked for me. \nGood Luck,   \n\nA: I had a similar problem. The solution I found was resetting the BIOS.\nI installed Ubuntu. Then worked on it for a few days. Then installed Apache2 and Tomcat. Suddenly the wired internet stopped working. looking at the dmesg log, I could see that connecting to eth0 failed on the r8169 port. \nEventually I tried to reinstall Ubuntu (12.04). The installation program failed to find internet (something which was successful a few days earlier). Suspecting HW problem I updated BIOS to latest version (ASUS M4A785-M). It didnt help. Struggling a few more hours, then tried to reset the BIOS (removing the battery and shortcutting the reset pin on the motherboard). This did the trick. Now the wired NW works again.\nBTW. When the Wired NW failed, wifi still worked flawless (via wifi dongle). \n\nA: I just wanted to share this, not sure if this is the key to all problems but ...\nI have a brand new Optiplex 3010 with Windows 7 installed and wanted Ubuntu as dual boot system. Could not get Ubuntu to recognize the network card, rebuilt the kernel per instructions here, installed and re-installed 13.10 Desktop several times. It shows no network connection during the install. \nOne article I found in my many switches back and forth to Windows was that windows shuts off the network and the Ubuntu driver then cannot find it. Not a difference, or I have not found the switch the undoes that. \nI just took a different network cable to a different port on the router and plugged it into the system, voilà there is the network. Now upgrading to 14.04 and responding to this. \nWhat I am saying is, that unless there is a network cabling issue (not sure why the windows driver should be less sensitive to this than the Ubuntu driver) there seems to be something switched off in the router or some established ip-address ignored when windows switches the network off to preserve power. A different port/ip is recognized.\nThis is for the real guru's to investigate. \nAnyway, lets see what happens next. The driver that is loaded at this time is r8169.\n", "Q: Can I launch game from steam at fullscreen on external monitor on laptop? I have recently installed steam and Dota 2 on my Ubuntu box. I would like to use my external monitor to get the \"full experience\". The problem is that when I use the fullscreen option I get the game on fullscreen on my laptop screen. I have checked \"Make this the primary display for the X Screen\" for external display in NVidia X Server Settings. \nWhat else can I do to use my external monitor for fullscreen gaming ?\n\nA: I was able to get it working in Ubuntu 14.04 under the display settings under \"Launcher Placement\" selecting the monitor I wanted my apps to launch on. Hope this helps! Now Dota 2 launches on my primary full screen! WEWT\n\nA: I had this problem, still have it I guess.  The only way I was able to fix it was to make the monitor I wanted the game on to start at pixel 0,0.  My 19\" 4:3 was on the left and my 22\" 16:9 was on the right and Dota 2 was forever launching on the left monitor no matter where I put the launcher.\nI swapped the monitors (logically, mind you), so that the 22\" 16:9 was on the left beginning at 0,0 and Dota2 launched on the widescreen properly.\n\nA: I have a similar problem. I'm using a dual monitor desktop with the most recent Nvidia drivers available, and I'm also using Ubuntu 13.04.\nI have my main monitor selected on my Nvidia-settings and all the other games run on this screen perfectly, but I can't get Dota 2 (the new release, not the Dota 2 -test) to run on my main screen. Every time I select fullscreen it goes to the wrong monitor.\nWhat I am doing is running the game in a lower resolution and in windowed mode. This way I can just drag it to the main screen. If I use my real resolution, the upper and left bar of Ubuntu won't let me fit the screen properly.\nThis is not a solution, but in the meantime there is no other way.\nIt looks like it should be simple enough to force the game to run on my main screen, but I'm also new to Linux.\n\nA: As a better solution I may suggest to turn off the external monitor for a while, launch Dota 2 and then alt-tab and turn on your external monitor back. I am an amd-user, so cannot test this idea. Please let me know if it works.\n", "Q: Will Mir improve multiple-monitor support? I have two big personal issues with Ubuntu nowadays. One of them is very poor multiple-monitor support compared to Mac or Windows. It's a fact that I am scared every time I connect/disconnect my notebook to any customer's screen, and I pray for it to function correctly. \nDo you have any information if Mir will improve Ubuntu's multiple-monitor support?\n\nA: As per Ubuntu Blueprints for 13.10.  \nThis blueprint is meant to capture the tasks associated with enabling multimonitor support with Mir, targeting the 13.10 xmir release. This would include hotplugging monitors, as well as projectors. The effort should be focused on delivering for the 13.10 desktop experience, however the architecture should support the future inclusion of mobile multi-display.\nFor complete detail see Support for Multimonitor \nSource:Support for Multimonitor \n", "Q: Cryptsetup does not accept passphrase after installation I used the xubuntu 13.04 installer and selected german keyboard layout. Afterwards i checked that I want to install with encryption via LUKS on a LVM. There I entered my passphrase and the setup install the system.\nAfter a reboot i have to enter my passphrase, but it seems that cryptsetup my passphrase.\nI tried to use keys like us layout and also german keymapping but neither of them worked.\nSome help apreciated\n\nA: You can try to redo the installation and go to 'Try Ubuntu' before doing the actual installation. There you can set the keyboardlayout and it should become effective.\nThere is even a comment about this on the bug tracker.\n\nA: I had the same issue with Ubuntu 16.04.1.\nIt turned out that when defining the passphrase in the installer, the keyboard was using the US layout, but I thought it had my native layout. This means that when I was setting the passphrase, it was recorded differently from what I believed.\nAfter reboot, I was asked for the passphrase using the native (in my case, Finnish) layout that I had selected in the installer. \nThe solution was to reverse-map the passphrase: I imaginined that I was pressing the keys according to my native layout, and wrote down the symbols that would be output if I pressed the key in the same position in a US layout. This was the actual passphrase. Now when I entered it using my native layout at startup, the passphrase was accepted.\n", "Q: what are these parameters in application.desktop? I set up a custom launcher in .local/share/applcations by copying and modifying one of the launchers in /usr/share/applications\nIt works fine but I was wondering what the meaning of parameters are that are passed along after Exec=program \nsuch as %f, %F, %c, %U?\nIs there a manpage or a list somewhere that explains these parameters?\n\nA: \nThe Exec key must contain a command line. A command line consists of\n  an executable program optionally followed by one or more arguments.\n  The executable program can either be specified with its full path or\n  with the name of the executable only. If no full path is provided the\n  executable is looked up in the $PATH environment variable used by the\n  desktop environment. The name or path of the executable program may\n  not contain the equal sign (\"=\"). Arguments are separated by a space. \n%f \nA single file name, even if multiple files are selected. The system\n  reading the desktop entry should recognize that the program in\n  question cannot handle multiple file arguments, and it should should\n  probably spawn and execute multiple copies of a program for each\n  selected file if the program is not able to handle additional file\n  arguments. If files are not on the local file system (i.e. are on HTTP\n  or FTP locations), the files will be copied to the local file system\n  and %f will be expanded to point at the temporary file. Used for\n  programs that do not understand the URL syntax. \n%F \nA list of files. Use for apps that can open several local files at\n  once. Each file is passed as a separate argument to the executable\n  program.\n%c \nThe translated name of the application as listed in the appropriate\n  Name key in the desktop entry. \n%U \nA list of URLs. Each URL is passed as a separate argument to the\n  executable program. Local files may either be passed as file: URLs or\n  as file path.\n\nFor complete detail see Desktop Entry Specification\nSource:Desktop Entry Specification\n", "Q: Why is System76 not mentioned on the Ubuntu certified hardware partners page? Why is System76 not mentioned on the Ubuntu certified hardware partners website \nThey are producing only Ubuntu preinstalled and optimized computers:\nhttps://www.system76.com/laptops/model/galu1\nThey even have an Ubuntu-logo key instead of win key between ctrl and alt ;)\nWhy are they not mentioned there?\n\nA: We don't submit our Computers to Canonical for Validation testing for a number of reasons. \n\n\n*\n\n*We have a very rapid hardware development cycle, and submitting to Canonical for validation would slow that testing and development down and reduce our ability to launch new product quickly.\n\n*We do a large suite of in-house testing to ensure that Ubuntu runs flawlessly out of the box on all of our computers. This that instead of needing a validation to tell you it works, simply buying System76 from the start guarantees compatibility with Ubuntu, since that's all we work with.\n\n\nA: From the Ubuntu website:\n\nOEMs submit systems to Canonical's testing facility where certification testing and validation is performed by Canonical engineers.\n\nIt is possible that System76 did not submit their systems for certification. If they did, it is possible that their systems were not up to Canonical's standards. One can only speculate as to why System76's systems are not Ubuntu-certified. For a more definite answer, you should contact System76.\nA machine does not need to be certified for Ubuntu to work on it. From the Ubuntu website:\n\nUbuntu works on a range of hardware which has not been certified by the manufacturer. The Ubuntu community works together to test and report the range of systems that work with Ubuntu.

But fsck runs clean on my partition, so i am uncertain how to approach the problem.\n\nA: There was an Input Output error at your Hard Disk sda part, at sector 4650928. \nYou can boot from Ubuntu Live cd/dvd/usb, start Disks Utility, try to see the SMART data and test your sda disk.\nPossible duplicate\n\nA: The DMA read error was real. There was indeed a bad sector and replacing the SATA cables did not help. I finally tried to re-install from LiveCD, and the installation failed due to my bad disk drive.

I tried setting it up with Apache, but it didn’t work because Apache user, www-data, doesn’t have root privileges needed for accessing everything. And Apache refused to run as root either.\nWhat can I do to solve this? I would much prefer not complicating matters by switching to NFS or Samba through a VPN. It’s just a small cheap server after all.\n\nA: As you can tell by the comments, your use case is far from conventional or recommended. You are trying to mount and modify an entire filesystem by using an apache process running inside a permissions and security model on that filesystem.  This problem will not go away, because Apache is of course designed to prevent remote persons from controlling the whole damn filesystem (including the parts \"underneath\" Apache or root).  So you need to:\n\n\n*\n\n*rethink your problem as one that fits inside the Apache model, or \n\n*find some system-level webdav support (unlikely), or \n\n*forget about webdav (most likely).  \n\n\nProbably a combination of 1 and 3.  You cannot legitimately want to be able to overwrite, say, libc remotely.  This is why we are looking at you strangely.  What are you trying to affect?  If you are trying to use this to roll out system configuration changes, find an appropriate tool (chef, puppet, etc.).  If you are using this as deployment mechanism (say for websites or applications), try a build tool like gradle. \nIf you are that worried about speed, you shouldn't be remotely mounting a filesystem anyway.  For example, when you would prefer to bundle a series of edits and deliver them compressed in a semantic group... then you're talking about git (version control).  No persistent connection, nothing more than SSL needed, compressed storage, compressed communication, rollback capability, etc.  But even in that case you shouldn't be messing w/ binaries on the running system.\n", "Q: Ubuntu Brainstorm site down/dead? is http://brainstorm.ubuntu.com dead?\nI get redirected to http://community.ubuntu.com/ ?\nother references are dead as well. https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Brainstorm/\nThis mailing list suggest the closure in May 2013:\n https://lists.ubuntu.com/archives/ubuntu-devel/2013-May/037100.html\nBut I couldn't find any official note.

I'm using Xubuntu 13.04 from live usb.\nI know that in order to be able to keep files/settings/etc after restart, USB live disk should be created with some storage reserved.\nHowever since I got this USB from a friend who created installation, I don't know if he reserved any space, and so my questions are:\n\n\n*\n\n*How can I find out amount of space reserved (if any)?\n\n*If no space is reserved, can I manually chose USB/HDD location to store my settings in order to be able to boot into them the next time I log on?\n\n\nI'm currently running a very long session and it would help me if I could somehow be able to store my settings (firefox, apt-gets, xrandr screen conf. ... ) to not have to do it again after I reboot.\nThanks,\nIR\n\nA: If your settings and files are not saved when you reboot, you do not have persistence enabled.\nYou can either make a new Flash drive. This may be easiest as there are graphical tools to do this for you (\"install\" the iso to the flash drive and enable persistence).\nSee: https://wiki.ubuntu.com/LiveUsbPendrivePersistent#Live_USB_creator_.28GUI-based.29\nAlternately you can manually enable persistence. You can do this either by making a file or partition named \"casper-rw\". I think making a file would be easiest.\nFirst, mount the flash drive at say /mnt\nsudo mount /dev/sda1 /mnt\n\nthen make a file, change the count to increase the size:\ndd if=/dev/zero of=/mnt/casper-rw bs=1M count=128\n\nmkfs.ext4 /mnt/casper-rw\n\nThen reboot, at the boot screen add the work \"persistent\" to the boot options.\nSee https://help.ubuntu.com/community/LiveCD/Persistence#Using_a_Loopback_File for details.\n", "Q: Get-iplayer stopped working get-iplayer is a really handy script that lets you download BBC programs so you can watch them later.\nRecently it's just stopped fetching programs, emitting errors like:\nERROR: RTMP_ReadPacket, failed to read RTMP packet header\nINFO: Command exit code 1 (raw code = 256)\n\nIs this the end of it or is there a fix/update?

I'm developing on a system that's running Lucid 10.04.4 LTS. I can't do a complete release upgrade in order to get access to newer packages, although I do have sudo so I can otherwise muck about as needed, as long as I don't change the release version or kernel.\nWith Lucid's repos, including backports, I can only get boost 1.40 packages. I need a feature from a newer version of boost (I think - I'm trying to find a workaround in parallel with this questions), but I'd really like to avoid installing from source because that can turn into a rabbit hole... especially since newer packages do exist; just not in the standard Lucid repos. Is there a repo somewhere I could connect to and get newer boost packages?  (Basically, I'm looking for a backport, but one that doesn't appear in the official Lucid backports...)\n\nA: You are looking for backports that don't exist in your upstream repository (because of the end of life thing).  So the answer is that you need to:\n\n\n*\n\n*find repositories (that you trust!) that include the desired backports for your version\n\n*bite the bullet and upgrade to a supported OS version\n\n*build from source or otherwise acquire desired components\n\n\nThe former means adding something to your /etc/apt/sources.list file manually or using add-apt-repository.  I can't recommend a given repo since I don't know what you need, but here's an example for nginx:\nsudo -s\necho \"deb http://nginx.org/packages/ubuntu/ lucid nginx\"     >>/etc/apt/sources.list\necho \"deb-src http://nginx.org/packages/ubuntu/ lucid nginx\" >>/etc/apt/sources.list\nnginx=stable # use nginx=development for latest development version\nadd-apt-repository ppa:nginx/$nginx\napt-get update \napt-get install nginx\n\nhttp://wiki.nginx.org/Install#Ubuntu_PPA\nYou should look for similar repos for whatever software you want.\nFair warning: your expectation that it will be easier to not change the base Ubuntu version is questionable.  At some point you will have cherry picked a whole bunch of components that were designed, tested and documented primarily against newer releases and it would just make sense to be on that release.  \nFor development purposes you might find it way cleaner to just install/run VirtualBox (or another virtualization platform) and put the latest and greatest OS on there virtually.  \n", "Q: How to enable PM_DEBUG?

I am trying to copy a folder from my local drive to this flash drive. The folder I am trying to copy contains about 225000 4KB files. I have tried to copy using the folder GUI and with terminal. Both times it copies exactly 21844 files and then I get the error:\n\"cannot create regular file `filename': No space left on device\"\nI also have a compressed copy of the files and I have tried extracting this directly into the USB drive, again stopping after 21844 files. \nI have looked for possible solutions and tried emptying the trash but that does not solve the issue. I have also formatted the drive to FAT32 and tried again, but that doesn't work. Does anyone have any suggestions?\nI am running Ubuntu 12.04 and the USB drive is an ADATA S107.\n\nA: There are two ways to run out of space on a filesystem:\n1)Actually running out of space for the data\n2)Running out of some filesytem resource like inodes or\nfat table entries.\nLots of little files may cause running out of inodes -- the filesystems\nare built with a default number of inodes and that may not meet\nyour needs.  The FAT32 filesystem is limited to 64k files per directory\n(max, long names will reduce that), so that will not work for you unless\nyou combine the small files with an archiver like tar before you copy them.\nThe archiver approach should work for any case, and will certainly reduce the\nstress on the flash memory -- think of the number of writes the directory\nblock may get while being built, and hope the drivers are smart about buffering.\n Maybe you should put the same type of filesystem on the 16G stick\nas you have on your hard drive? (I'm guessing ntfs, since its directory\nlimit is over 4 million).\n You can run mke2fs with switches to change the default inode size/number.\nRun the manual pages\nman mke2fs\n\nfor a full description.\n  The other possibility is you are really running out of space for the data -- \nyou know your files are only 4K, but ask yourself, how much space does the\nfilesystem allocate for them?  Check the free space left when the stick\nsays no more space -- free space indicates lack of inodes.  No free space,\nwell, there's always the archiver to fix that too.\n", "Q: All of my video is going fast, and has no sound Movie Player, Blender, Youtube and Vimeo on chorme.\nEverything I try to play on my system has this issue.\nThe videos play very fast, and have no sound at all.\nI just did an update, can I undo it?\nShould I?\nI'm using Ubuntu 13.04, and I just did the regular update when prompted.\nAdded: Grooveshark doesn't play, so it seems I have no sound at all.\n\nA: It was just that the sound settings were set to S/PDIF instead of Speakers for some reason.\nWhy that would effect video playback, I have no idea.\n", "Q: Patching kernel for graphics tablet, not sure if it'll work I just got a new graphics tablet that seems to be supported in kernel 3.11, found this: https://patchwork.kernel.org/patch/2624521/\nI downloaded the new kernel deb packages from here http://kernel.ubuntu.com/~kernel-ppa/mainline/v3.11-rc1-saucy/ and installed them but apparently nVidia doesn't have drivers for 3.11 yet (nor 3.10) so I had to revert back to 3.8.\nNow my question is, can I just follow instructions here https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Kernel/Compile, and apply that patch to my current kernel in Ubuntu 13.04 or is there any other way I can get this working with no headaches?\n\nA: From https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Kernel/MainlineBuilds\n\nThe mainline kernels builds are produced for debugging purposes and therefore come with no support.

However I seem to be having no luck. The terminal simply answers by giving me a list of possible java commands - which funnily enough include \"-cp\". How do I get Ubuntu to take me seriously and actually do what I tell him?\n\nA: Executive Summary\njava -cp doesn't automatically run a program in the specified classpath, it just specifies the classpath to use when running a Java program which you must then specify in that same command.\nFull Explanation\njava runs Java programs. It does not modify them or store persistent configuration about them.\nThe -cp flag does not set the classpath, it specifies a classpath to use when running a java program.\nRunning java with only a -cp flag (and its argument) is invalid syntax. You must tell java what java program you want to run with that classpath. This will run that program, once, with that classpath. It will not cause it to be run with that classpath in the future unless the classpath is specified again.\nIt's unclear from your question exactly what you're trying to accomplish, but I've detailed a few possibilities below.\n(If you still need more information, please feel free to edit your question for clarification and comment on this answer, or if you find you have a separate question, you can ask it separately. The manual page for the java command may also help; please note that the name of a class or jar file is required. To get the manual page for the exact installed version of java on your machine, run man java.)\nYou might not have to manually set a classpath at all.\nIf myapp is a directory located in /home/ubuntu, which contains classes for your program, then you don't (generally) have to specify a classpath at all. In that case, just run the program (i.e., pass the name of the class that contains the program's main function to java.\nFor example, if the .class file for the class that contains your main method is /home/ubuntu/myapp/launch-myapp.class, just run:\njava /home/ubuntu/myapp/launch-myapp\n\n(Note that you don't specify the .class suffix, as it is implied.)\nMost Java programs consist of multiple classes and often all the .class files are packed into a single .jar file. If that's the case, run java with the -jar flag and specify its full filename.\nFor example, if your program's classes (including the class containing main) is provided by the file /home/ubuntu/myapp/myapp.jar, just run:\njava -jar /home/ubuntu/myapp/myapp.jar\n\nNote that, to run a .jar file with java -jar, you do specify the .jar extension at the end of the filename; it is not taken to be implied.\nMuch less frequently, you might really want to manually specify a classpath.\nTo do that, you must specify the the classpath and also what Java program you want to run (i.e., the class that contains its main method).\nFor example, suppose you want to run /home/bob/myapp.class with the classpath /home/ubuntu/myapp. Then you would run:\njava -cp /home/ubuntu/myapp /home/bob/myapp\n\nOr if you're running /home/bob/myapp.jar with that classpath:\njava -cp /home/ubuntu/myapp -jar /home/bob/myapp.jar\n\nYou might be trying to set the default classpath, to be used when running any Java program in the future (except when an alternate classpath is specified).\nIf that's what you're trying to do, you should set the CLASSPATH environment variable. See the official documentation on that as pointed out by karel.\nIn short, you simply make CLASSPATH a semicolon-delimited list of the directories you want searched automatically.\nFor more information on setting environment variables, see this question and this Ubuntu documentation wiki page.\n", "Q: Why Is My PCIe NIC Disabled?

It will be updated from time to time and these updates might break compatibility with your hardware or introduce new bugs. Nevertheless, it's also expected to be more performant than fglrx\n\n*The experimental packages contain beta drivers.

Although I have used NetBeans once for a project, what languages do I need to learn to become a full-fledged Ubuntu developer?\nMy project in NetBeans (Java only) was to design a calculator (relatively easy). Moreover, how do we learn to make image viewers, browsers, etc.?\nAlso, what would be the best language for certain applications?\n\nA: If you are intending to write applications for Ubuntu that can run on multiple devices and form factors (desktop, phone, tablet, TV...), I'd recommend to learn QML and JavaScript. Essentially:\n\n\n*\n\n*Use QML to write convergent Ubuntu apps that run across form factors and devices\n\n*Use JavaScript to complement QML when writing Ubuntu apps and to write Ubuntu webapps\n\n\nA: You should learn:\n\n\n*\n\n*JavaScript: as most UI frameworks/env. are/will be based on JavaScript; you will need it anyway some day or other.\n\n\nThen for all the rest you will need something else:\n\n\n*\n\n*C++/C\n\n*\n\n*pros: amazingly fast, access to low level features\n\n*cons: lots of time to learn how to write something stable, awful community\n\n\n*Ruby:\n\n*\n\n*pros: easy to learn, really pleasing to write, great community\n\n*cons: might be slow for some task (really)\n\n\n*Python: \n\n*\n\n*pros: lots of packages are in python, great community, fast, etc.\n\n*cons: python 3 (just kindin')\n\n\n\nBut there are still many other languages such as Java, etc., however, the above mentioned may be the easier for a start, except C/C++ but which worth learning as you will be able to use it with many other languages (e.g extend python, ruby, etc.)\n\nA: The answer is simple and not really helpful. Whichever language is needed. Ubuntu is a ton of software, some of it written in C, some C++, some in Python, Perl, bash... and others. You should definitely learn scripting with bash, and you should pick a language like Perl or Python, possibly the latter. Furthermore, learning good old fashioned C never hurt anyone -- you learn more about how programs work, what are libraries, lots of stuff on other tools.\nOtherwise -- first find a task, a niche, something that needs to be worked on or something that is missing or something that is just fascinating and you would like to work on it. And then find out what language will be good for that purpose.\n\nA: Programming work consists of both the actual code, and the mental model below it.\nTeaching yourself a programming language is easy as long as you have the basic concepts of how computers work, however in order to make useful contributions to a project, you also need to understand the design behind it.\nMy suggestion is thus to join a project that you take personal interest in and use often, and then start out with quality assurance work:\n\n\n*\n\n*if there is a bug report that is somewhat vague, try to replicate the problem, and improve the description. Bonus points for an automated test.\n\n*if there is an old bug that hasn't had any attention for a while, try to see whether it still exists, and update the bug report\n\n*if there are testsuite failures, try to find out what is happening in order that causes this test to fail\n\n\nThis will allow you to learn about the difficult, conceptual part of the project on a manageable learning curve, while keeping your interest (because it is a project you care about) and giving you access to the community around the project. The actual programming language (whichever is used in the project) is something you can pick up on the fly.\nFor an example of a somewhat gradual entry, look at my contributions to the Beignet project. Knowledge of the programming language (C/C++ in that instance) is certainly not the limiting factor here.\n\nA: You should learn... all of them ! Or rather meta-learn all languages. When you know two or three languages, you can quickly learn any new language which is similar to these ones. If you know enough languages, you \"virtually\" know them all, and, more importantly, you understand that which is part of the language, and that which pertains to the programming independently of the language. Ultimately, specific languages are irrelevant.\nSo you might want to learn Java, C, Scheme, OCaml, Assembly (two architectures at least), Forth and a bit of Prolog, not necessarily in that order. The second language will be the hardest, because you will have to both learn new concepts, and forget concepts which you learned with the first language but turned out to be wrong. Afterwards it is easy and only becomes easier.\nThen, when dealing with a specific development task, use the most adapted language based on availability and support of compilers and libraries, knowledge of co-workers, policy constraints from management, and so on. Flexibility of mind is the key. Knowing many languages grants this flexibility.\n", "Q: How do I connect a video camera to an Ubuntu laptop? I have a Panasonic video camera and I want to download movies on my computer. What should I do?\n\nA: If the camcorder has a USB cable to connect to a computer, then in most cases plugging in the video camera to the computer running Ubuntu should make the video camera act similarly to a USB pen; Ubuntu should recognise that it has been plugged in and either open up the folder or give you a list of options (including open folder). Note that you may in some cases need to switch the camera on while it is plugged in or before it is plugged in to get it to work.\nIf this does not work, then Ubuntu may be struggling to mount the video camera. There are lots of troubleshooting guides for this sort of issue. Just for reference, what model is the video camera?\n\nA: install Cheese to use your webcam to install cheese \n\n\n*\n\n*open your terminal \n\n*Type \n\n*sudo apt-get install cheese\n\n\n*\n\n*Run Cheese.

The purpose of the crontab is to run headless jobs -- without any interactive output or graphical display, and only with logging messages to a file. Crontab has no connection to your graphical display. However, you can try to give the information about your display by setting the DISPLAY environmental variable. \nSomething like this might work:\n* * * * * DISPLAY=:0.0 vlc -vvv rtsp://your.url 2>&1 > /tmp/vlc.log\n\nNote that you will still not be able to see the vlc output in your current terminal -- crontab runs the schedule without having any idea what your current terminal or terminal emulator is. Therefore, if you want verbosity or logging, you should save the output to a file.\nPost scriptum: Erik is right, you will also need to deal with XAUTHORITY if your command is started by root.

I found no settings or options to share folders on my network, I do have Samba installed. I don't know what else to try. Is there a command that I can try in terminal for Xubuntu? I do see my Xubuntu machine from other computers on my network, but shows empty when I access it on other computers. Ubuntu is more user friendly for such purpose. \n\nA: Install Samba (package name system-config-samba). If you are using Xubuntu 13.10 then also install gksu. Then go to Settings Manager -> Samba and add the desired shares.\nAlternatively you can edit the /etc/samba/smb.conf file and add something like this\n[set share name here]\n    path = set path here\n    comment = set description here\n    writeable = no\n    browseable = yes\n    read only = yes\n    guest ok = yes\n\n\nA: Unfortunately neither shares-admin (crashes) nor system-config-samba (deprecated) work in recent Xubuntu releases. Other than in Nautilus we do not have an option to share directories from Thunar.\nThis apparently means that as of today we do not have a working graphical method to setup Samba shares in Xubuntu.\nSo after installing samba and defining a Samba user with:\nsudo apt install samba\nsudo smbpasswd -a [user]  ## [user] must already exist for Xubuntu\n\nWe can use the command net usershare for adding directories. Because of  better copy & paste ability I find it more convenient to create an entry in /etc/samba/smb.conf:\n[share name]\n    path = full path to shared directory\n    comment = optional description\n    writeable = yes\n    browseable = yes\n    read only = yes\n    guest ok = yes\n\nFurther options for smb.conf can be read in the Samba documentation.

I've recently installed Ubuntu with a full disk encryption which means I have to enter a password at boot to get the system up and running. This is excellent and exactly what I want for the future.\nRight now though, as I am installing software, I would like to temporarily turn of the password request, having the system boot automatically. I know this defeats the point of encryption, but I am getting tired of having to connect an external monitor everytime I reboot. I'd prefer to, for the time being, to be able to reboot the encrypted system via ssh.\nOnce all the software I require is in place, I plan to bring the password request back.\nAnybody know how I do this?\n\nA: You can arrange for a \"keyscript\" to supply the decryption passphrase at boot time. The keyscript is just a program that can do whatever it needs to do to get the passphrase, including fetching it over the network.\nI wanted to to be able to boot a headless system by supplying the passphrase over the network, with the caveat that I understand that the network must be secure at the time that I supply the passphrase. I achieve this security by disconnecting the LAN cable and plugging in a crossover, which I can do as I have easy physical access. This is still easier than plugging in a keyboard and monitor, as I don't have any nearby.\nTo do this, I wrote a keyscript that waits for a passphrase to be supplied over the network. The keyscript and some instructions are on Github.\n\nA: I don't think this is possible, by design. In order for SSH to come up the boot would have had to progress to a certain point (network up, etc) and that all requires the disk to be unencrypted.\nI do have a couple of alternatives though:\n\n\n*\n\n*Just encrypt homes. This would work well enough for a desktop system but if you're headless and only using SSH, this leaves you in the position where you wouldn't be able to SSH in with public key authentication (password still works AFAIK).\n\n*Embed the system below a virtualisation hypervisor that supports a KVM forwarder. This first requires a base installation of an operating system. Ubuntu will do. Then you install Xen in that, and then create a virtual cubby hole for your server and install into that. That's obviously the abridged version of how you'd do that, more here.\nWith Xen you can then xm list to get the ID of your virtual server, and then xm console <id> to get console access. In your case, this should present you with a prompt to unlock the server.\nIf the base computer is otherwise graphical, you could simplify this process by using something like VMWare and VNCing in but this won't give you as good performance as Xen. I don't think lighter options like LXC will work here.\nI don't think there's an easy migration in either of these cases; you'll have to reinstall. As Uli says, is all this commotion worth it?\nA couple more physical options:\n\n\n*\n\n*A real KVM. This essentially lets you switch one keyboard, monitor and mouse between two computer. For VGA and PS/2 connectors this is cheap. If you want HDMI and USB it's probably more expensive.\n\n*KVM over IP. A little box you plug into your video card and keyboard/mouse ports and your network. Then you just VNC into the box and you have like-physical access. Unfortunately these are quite costly.

I see there's a Geany tag, but I don't know if there are any restrictions on what kind of questions are acceptable.\nI just tried using Geany today for CSS editing because it was recommended here on AskUbuntu. It is pretty cool and with the \"Web Preview\" plugin, it gives me the real time CSS preview that I was hoping for.\nBut, it's been frustrating me because when I save the CSS or HTML file I am working on, it takes a long time to load. A \"long time\" in this context is something like 5 seconds, which gets very aggravating when you are making changes and saving files rapidly in order to compare and contrast different CSS settings.\nIs there a setting or something I can change to reduce or remove this lag? Is it a settings issue or just a bug?\n\nA: Maybe a little late, but this refreshes the page every xx seconds, maybe that is usefull, change it to 3 for example and save and you only have to wait max 3 seconds and not have to switch between pages(if on 2 screens or something)\n<meta http-equiv=\"refresh\" content=\"xx\">\n(put it between the      head /head tags)\nArend-Jan\n", "Q: How can I fix Deja Dup hanging on restore? I messed up with GIT and did hard reset (accidentally) and my effort to cancel it (from CL IDE) failed so my code is gone. Thank God today Deja Dup did a backup (although it did not finish as I told to go on later). So I tried to restore from Ubuntu one and it shows me the dates and I select today then it checks things and start the restore and hangs there.\nIt presents no error, no message just restoring. I dont know what to do. The dates are not found in Ubuntu one so I don't know where does this Deja Dup get the from. I don't know what to do as for now\n\n\nUbuntu one shot is this (No 18/07/2013)\n\n\nA: Well As Salem said the Deja-Dup wa running fine and its perfectly normal for it to not give message of progress for very long time (at least it could say scanning but it is note coded to do so). So after being patient for two hours (Actually I left the computer on and started doing something else) I found the restoration done.\nI will see if I can file feature request to add verbose mode so that user knows what is going on!\n", "Q: How to get rid of this nonsense pop-up appearing in Ubuntu while using Chromium browser? I am using Ubuntu in a public location where dozens of users come and visit a site and then go, so for each customer it opens google.com and when they are done, it restarts Chromium by killing it first.\nNow, everytime, I get this ugly nonsense pop-up appearing to RESTORE which make no sense in my use case.\nHow to get rid of this ugly pop-up appears all the time in Ubuntu? Is there any command line or settings to completely kill this RESTORE nonsense?\n\n\nA: Well, this is the desired behaviour. I guess there are plenty of ways of dealing with it more professionally. Simplest solution is to use kill -15 rather than kill -9. The former just politely asks google chrome to stop, so it has time to save the data.\nIf you are running an internet kiosk, you should clean up the profile after each user, however. Create a profile, and then copy it to a temporary location before you start chrome, start chrome with an option google-chrome --user-data-dir=/the/tmp/profile, and clean it up before chrome is started again. For example\n#!/bin/bash\n\n# google chrome starter\n\nPROFILE.DIR=/usr/local/share/default.profile/\nTMP.PROFILE=/tmp/google-profile\n\nrm -rf $TMP.PROFILE\ncp -a $PROFILE.DIR $TMP.PROFILE\ngoogle-chrome --kiosk --user-data-dir=$TMP.PROFILE\n\nThus, every user will start chrome, every user sees the same immutable profile.\n\nA: If something happens between users (eg they press something to start or end their session), which it seems to be true, I would strongly suggest refreshing the Chrome profile from a master copy (that you store somewhere uneditable but readable by the current user).\nsudo cp -r ~/.config/google-chrome{,-fresh}/\nsudu chown -R root: ~/.config/google-chrome-fresh/\nsudo chmod -R o-w  ~/.config/google-chrome-fresh/\n\nAnd then have a script at ~/bin/google-chrome (or possibly somewhere higher up for security) \n#!/bin/bash\n\nrm -rf ~/.config/google-chrome/\ncp -r ~/.config/google-chrome{-fresh,}/\ngoogle-chrome \"$@\"\n\nAnd that'll need chmodding +x\nThe benefit of trashing the runtime profile is people do stupid things when they're using computers. You don't want their installed pluggins interacting with following users. Consider the threat of keyloggers and the like.\nCome to think of it, you should probably be using a fresh guest account each time a user comes and dumping the whole user each change. You'd need to shortcut lightdm out of the equation but you could do something manually quite easily with nodm and then you get the added benefit of not needing to load an entire desktop just to Kiosk a computer.\n", "Q: How to obtain mail icon on the top panel? I just installed Ubuntu 13.04. In 12.04 I used gmail notifier and I had handy mail icon on the top panel.\nNow with 13.04 I tried few email notifiers (like gm-notifier or unity mail) and I always ended up without mail icon on the top panel... Also, notification seems to not work.. even though I configured them and I have indicator-messages app.\nAny ideas?\n\nA: I have Unitymail running on 13.04 with it's appindicator. To enable some indicators you need a package named sni-qt installed. You find it in the USC. \n\nA: The mail indicator in the top panel won't be visible if no programs are using it. To see whether you have any programs using the mail indicator you'll need to use dconf-editor. If you don't have it installed, you'll need to install it first by opening the terminal and typing\nsudo apt-get install dconf-editor\n\nAfter which you can run it by pressing ALT+F2 and entering dconf-editor.\nWhen it's open, you'll have to find the messages indicator. I'm using Ubuntu 14.04, so on my system it's in com.canonical.indicator.messages. If it's empty, you can then manually add programs to it, like ['thunderbird.desktop','unity-mail.desktop'], etc.\nMake sure to restart the unity panel after you're done by pressing ALT+F2 and typing\nrestart unity-panel-service\n\nThe mail icon should then appear on the top panel.\nHowever, I've just tried installing Unity Mail myself, and the notifications don't work, neither on the top panel nor on the dashboard on the left. This appears to be due to an unsolved bug within the program.\nGood luck, and let me know if you find a program that works!\n", "Q: Can't open shared folders on a virtual box I created a virtual box of Ubnutu 12.04 64 bit, installed on a host with the same system.\nI installed VirtualBox Guest Additions on the guest, and restarted the guest. \nHowever, when I try to open \"shared folder\" on the guest, I still get a message saying that \"VirtualBox Guest Additions are not available\", and when I look at /media on the guest, I don't see the shared folders..\nI tried to install VirtualBox Guest Additions again, and restarted the host and the guest again, but I still cannot access the shared folders.\nAny suggestions?..\n\nA: *\n\n*Open VM main window.\n\n*Click File and Preferences. \n\n*Get in to the extensions option and use \"add package\" button to add your extension file.

This allows for smaller file\n  sizes than raw disk images, which allocate the whole image space to a\n  file, even if parts of it are empty.\n\nSo the file size is really 13MB, but it can grow up to 20GB when data is written to it. Example:\n$ qemu-img create -f qcow2 test.img 2G\nFormatting 'test.img', fmt=qcow2 size=2147483648 encryption=off cluster_size=65536 lazy_refcounts=off \n$ ls -l test.img \n-rw-r--r-- 1 carvalho carvalho 197120 Jul 18 09:30 test.img\n$ file test.img \ntest.img: QEMU QCOW Image (v2), 2147483648 bytes\n\nAn empty qcow2 file was created. It can hold a 2GB filesystem, but for now it only occupies 197KB in disk.\n\nFrom http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/QEMU/Images:\n\nThe \"cow\" part of qcow2 is an acronym for copy on write, a neat little\n  trick that allows you to set up an image once and use it many times\n  without changing it. This is ideal for developing and testing\n  software, which generally requires a known stable environment to start\n  off with. You can create your known stable environment in one image,\n  and then create several disposable copy-on-write images to work in.\nTo start a new disposable environment based on a known good image,\n  invoke the qemu-img command with the option -o backing_file and tell\n  it what image to base its copy on. When you run QEMU using the\n  disposable environment, all writes to the virtual disc will go to this\n  disposable image, not the base copy.\n\nFrom the qemu-img manpage:\n\nIf the option backing_file is specified, then the image will record\n  only the differences from backing_file. No size needs to be specified\n  in this case. backing_file will never be modified unless you use the\n  \"commit\" monitor command (or qemu-img commit).\n\nExample:\n$ qemu-img create -f qcow2 -o backing_file=test.img test01.img\nFormatting 'test01.img', fmt=qcow2 size=2147483648 backing_file='test.img' encryption=off cluster_size=65536 lazy_refcounts=off \n$ file test01.img \ntest01.img: QEMU QCOW Image (v2), has backing file (path test.img), 2147483648 bytes\n\nIn your case /var/lib/nova/instances/_base/035db99541e92b5cca93bf18a997d626f512b73d is the backing file. I don't know what is the expected bahavior if you try to use your qcow file without the backing file.\n\nAbout /var/lib/nova/instances in OpenStack documentation:\n\nThis directory contains the libvirt KVM file-based disk images for the\n  instances that are hosted on that compute node. If you are not running\n  your cloud in a shared storage environment, this directory will be\n  unique across all compute nodes.\n/var/lib/nova/instances contains two types of directories.\nThe first is the _base directory. This contains all of the cached base\n  images from glance for each unique image that has been launched on\n  that compute node. Files ending in _20 (or a different number) are the\n  ephemeral base images.\nThe other directories are titled instance-xxxxxxxx. These directories\n  correspond to instances running on that compute node. The files inside\n  are related to one of the files in the _base directory. They're\n  essentially differential-based files containing only the changes made\n  from the original _base directory.\n\n", "Q: Ubuntu desktop and server I installed Ubuntu server on a peripheral computer to a networks as I wanted to example it to a friend as a possible alternative.

The project is essentially un-maintained and doesn't work with juju-core (juju > 1.0). However, if you're using juju-core, you can use the --force-machine options during deploy to point the service to a machine. In the coming months support for containerization will land allowing you to more safely co-locate services on the same machine.\njuju deploy --force-machine 0 wordpress\n\nIf you're using juju 0.7 still, you can use jitsu to co-locate services using the following syntax\njitsu deploy-to 0 wordpress\n\nIn both examples 0 is the machine number you're trying to deploy to.\n\nA: You can deploy several charm on the same machine with jitsu depoy-to indeed.\nThe first argument is not the machine name though, it's the machine id.\nYou can get the machine id in the output of juju status: it start with all the machine in the \"machines\" section.

You'll probably see the same problem with tcpdump, netsniff-ng, or anything else that uses PF_PACKET sockets for sniffing on Linux (Linux in general, not just Ubuntu in particular, or even Ubuntu, Debian, and other Debian-derived distributions).\nGiven that those are two logical interfaces on the same machine, traffic between them will not go onto the Ethernet - no Ethernet adapters I know of will receive packets that they transmit, so if the packet were sent on the Ethernet the host wouldn't see it, and there wouldn't be any point in wasting network bandwidth by putting that traffic on the network even if the Ethernet adapter would see its own traffic.\nSo if you're capturing on eth0, you might not see the traffic.

I have a calculator button on my keyboard. Under Windows it starts Windows calculator. But under Xubuntu (but with kubuntu-desktop) it starts nothing, it is inactive. To start a calculator I have to choose it from Application > Utilities now.\nHow may I connect calculator button with calculator to start it as in Windows.\n\nA: Edit: Sorry, I somehow managed not to see that you are using KDE... This answer is for Xfce...\nAfaik these keys can be assigned the same way as any other keyboard shortcuts:\nGo to Settings → Keyboard → Shortcuts for Applications. (or similar - I am using the German localization). There should be a button to add new custom keyboard shortcuts.\nThe first dialogue that pops up after pressing the add button will ask about the command that should be run. I do not know by heart, which calculator is installed on Xubuntu, but you can try to enter xcalc as command name, or maybe gnome-calculator.\nThe second dialogue will then record the key you press.\n\nA: if you are using Compiz Config Settings Manager (CCSM) You can use the \"Commands\" Plugin to \"Assign bindings to arbitrary commands\". The \"Commands\" Plugin can be easily installed by dropping the next in a terminal: sudo apt-get install compiz-plugins-extra.\nIts powerful key grabber may have better chances to catch the custom keyboard buttons presses in order to provide the proper key binding which can be assigned to the proper command in the list. A Key Binding for a command, this is: \"Run command 0\" will invoke the line that you write in the Commands section related to the \"Command line 0\".\nIn the \"Commands\" tab of the \"Commands Plugin\", we write the arbitrary commands that we wish to be executed when we hit the proper key or key bindings, as shown in the next screenshot:\n\nThen we click on the \"Key Bindings\" tab of the same window in order to enable the proper key bindings for the command. Please notice that I placed the command for the calculator in the \"Command line 1\" thus the key bindings will be which corresponds to the \"Run command 1\" as shown in the next screenshot.\n\nWhat I did to see the \"Edit Run command 1\" key bindings it was to click in the \"Disabled\" button to the right, which showed me a window with a checkbox, after enabling it showed the options. Then simply hit the \"Grab key combination\" and press the proper button in your keyboard. Please notice that the key bindings corresponds to the \"XF86Calculator\" key.\nThis way you can define as many custom key bindings to fit your needs.\nGood luck!\nP.S. Compiz Config Settings Manager can be installed from the Software Center or by dropping sudo apt-get install ccsm in a terminal.\n\nA: \nSystem Settings -> Shorcuts and Gestures -> Custom Shortcuts\n  Edit -> New -> Global Shortcut -> Command/URL\n  On Action tab Command/URL: type \"kcalc\"\n  On Trigger tab, click the button (possibly labelled \"None\") to enter a keyboard Shortcut.\n\nNote that you may generalize this to use any calculator program (or any program) if you know the command that launches it - the above uses \"kcalc\" as an example.\nI believe this is the only answer so far that works for KDE (as asked for) without some additional special package installed.\nThanks to user lueck at the below reference, for this info:\nhttps://forum.kde.org/viewtopic.php?f=15&t=96246\n\nA: I am using a little script under Kubuntu, that does not only open KCalc, but checks if it is already open and if it is, brings it to the front:\n#!/bin/bash\nif [ `wmctrl -l | grep -c \"KCalc\"` != 0 ]\nthen\n    wmctrl -F -R \"KCalc\"\nelse\n    kcalc\nfi\n\nIt needs the package wmctrl to be installed.\nYou can set the script as custom Command/URL shortcut.

Here what you can do.  Try Boot-Rpair, and EasyBCD first, if that doesn't help, then here's what you can do. \nBoot from the Ubuntu LiveCD, and once booted, just press Ctrl+Alt+T on your keyboard to open Terminal. When it opens, run the command(s) below:\nsudo apt-get install wipe\n\nOnce installed, find your drive's label using:\nsudo fdisk -l\n\nOnce you get the device label, do:\nsudo wipe /dev/sdaX\n\nReplce X with your drives ID.\nThe procedure is irreversible.  All data on the drive will be completely gone , and probably won't be able to recover.\nYou need to figure our the correct hard drive to wipe.

Using the \"Displays\" utility, mirroring and extended desktop both work. It's not 100% buttery smooth, but it works. The Saucy 3.10.1 kernel also works just fine with Raring. I can't tell any difference between the 3.9 and 3.10 kernels in terms of DisplayLink.\nIf your DisplayLink monitor does not work out of the box with Ubuntu 12.10 or 13.04, installing Linux kernel 3.9 or higher may \"just work\". Apparently the baked in DisplayLink drivers have been improved.\nInstalling a prebuilt kernel is simple; download the header and image deb files for the kernel of your choice (3 files total). Install the headers first, then the kernel image. Next time you reboot, you should be using the updated kernel (check the version with \"uname -r\"). If you want to boot into an older kernel again, holding the shift key while your computer is booting will bring up a menu that allows you to select which kernel to boot. If you have issues with a new kernel, you can always uninstall it. I recommend using Synaptic to do so.\nhttp://kernel.ubuntu.com/~kernel-ppa/mainline/\n\nA: As an intermediate step, you can place a static image on a DisplayLink device using the instructions here:\nhttps://askubuntu.com/a/393117/46709\nIf the static image works, then stepping up to the 3.9 Kernel has a chance of working.\n", "Q: How can I rename or alias an lpr CUPS queue name? I plugged a printer into Ubuntu and it was instantly configured. Amazing!\nNow I want to share that printer on the network, so I've told CUPS to do that and I can print to the printer using ipp://10.67.5.3/printers/HP-Laserjet-p3005.

I'd like to tell the Ubuntu machine to use lp1 as the lpr queue name for HP-Laserjet-p3005 as this would mean I don't have to reconfigure 20 machines.\nIs this possible (it must be!)?

To do so, I must print one page at a time and invert the page.\nWhat I want: I want to give one single print command for printing more than one pages and printer should wait for me after printing every single page.\nI don't know if that is even possible, but thought I should check it out. \nThanks in advance\n\nA: One way of doing it would be to print the odd pages first, feed all of them back in, and then print the even pages. It's not quite as concise as a single command, but it would be a lot quicker than authorising every individual page manually.\nTo do this: in the \"Print\" menu, go to the \"Page Setup\" tab. Under the \"Layout\" column of that page will be a box marked \"Only Print\". There, choose \"Odd sides\" and send the print job off - wait for it to finish, invert pages as necessary and then do the same again with \"Even sides\" (remembering to check the paper tray for the last page afterwards, if your document has an odd number of sides!)\nThis is the best solution I can think of for emulating duplex printing - it could have some issues if you want to do many-to-one printing, but for one-page-to-one-side it will work fine.\nFor many-to-one (say, if you want 2 pages to a side), you'd need to put the page sequences in manually - i.e. in Range on the main print page, you would type \"1,2,5,6,9,10,...\" the first time, followed by \"3,4,7,8,...\" the second. It's not perfect, but it'd work.\n", "Q: Mounting My Windows Drive If you would be so kind to explain and answer my dilemma, I'd be grateful of all of you.\nHere is the error:\nError mounting /dev/sda1 at /media/ubuntu/System: Command-line `mount -t \"ntfs\" -o \"uhelper=udisks2,nodev,nosuid,uid=999,gid=999,dmask=0077,fmask=0177\" \"/dev/sda1\" \"/media/ubuntu/System\"' exited with non-zero exit status 14: The disk contains an unclean file system (0, 0).\nMetadata kept in Windows cache, refused to mount.\nFailed to mount '/dev/sda1': Operation not permitted\nThe NTFS partition is in an unsafe state.

In the end, I just copied over the VBoxGuestAdditions.iso to the guest (using WinSCP), mounted it, and then ran VBoxLinuxAdditions.run from the guest. \nHere are the steps I took:\n\n\n*\n\n*Locate VBoxGuestAdditions.iso on your host (in my case, C:\\Program Files\\Oracle\\VirtualBox\\VBoxGuestAdditions.iso).\n\n*Copy VBoxGuestAdditions.iso to your guest (in my case, I used WinSCP).\n\n*In the terminal for the guest mount the ISO using the following:\nsudo mkdir /media/GuestAdditionsISO\nsudo mount -o loop path/to/VBoxGuestAdditions.iso /media/GuestAdditionsISO\n\n*At this point you'll probably get a message that the ISO has been mounted as READ-ONLY. That's perfectly fine. If you change into the directory /media/GuestAdditionsISO you should see VBoxLinuxAdditions.run and it should be executable:\ncd /media/GuestAdditionsISO\nls -l\n\n*Now just run VBoxLinuxAdditions.run:\nsudo ./VBoxLinuxAdditions.run\nYou also have the option of extracting VBoxGuestAdditions.iso in Windows (or whatever host OS you're using) and then SCP'ing (or WinSCP'ing) it over to the Ubuntu guest, and then just running: sudo ./VBoxLinuxAdditions.run\nBetter doing what I have listed above instead of wasting time and putting faith in methods that may or may not work on your particular configuration.\nHope this helps.\n\nA: I stuck with the same problem.\nRemoving and adding iso in virtualbox anew didn't help me too either.\nThe problem is that  auto-installation doesn't work.

I'm trying to create a DVD image from a .ts file but all dvd-maker programs I tried (devede, bombono) output .mpg files instead of the desired image with VIDEO_TS, AUDIO_TS folders and .vob files inside. \n\nA: Your question looks a bit ambiguous as you say explicitly say you are trying to \"create dvd from video file\" in the title of your question but then you mention that you are \"trying to make DVD image from .ts file\" and you add that you wish an: \"image with VIDEO_TS, AUDIO_TS folders and vobs inside.\"\nBoth tasks are related but seems to have different answers. \nFirst of all, if you already have the .ts and the .vob files is that easy as burning them in a DVD inside of a folder called VIDEO_TS (AUDIO_TS is optional).\nNow. If you have video files and you wish to create an iso image-file with the DVD files and folders inside of it, your best chance will be the usage of DVD Styler which can easily be installed in your system by dropping sudo apt-get install dvdstyler in a terminal or via the Software Center.\nThe process to create a video DVD from your collection of video files is a little bit complicated if this is your first time using DVD Styler, but you will get used to it soon.\nNow let's cook a One Video DVD without Menu following the next Recipe.\nThe ingredients:\n\n\n*\n\n*Ubuntu, your favorite flavour. I prefer 14.04 LTS\n\n*A fresh install of DVD Styler\n\n*One video file\n\n*Patience.\n\n\nDirections:\n1. Start New Project\nLet's start with a Nautilus File Browser opened in the folder where we have the video to be used for this recipe. We'll also open DVD Styler, the scenery may look like this:\n\nIn the first window, DVD Styler will welcome us by asking for the new project specs, it is usually set to our region specs so we need not to change anything in this screen but if you wish you can adjust the video quality in the drop down list having in mind that a bigger bitrate will deliver high quality Videos but it will also reduce the capacity of the DVD. \n\nWhen ready, hit the \"OK\" button after which you'll see the \"Select template for DVD menus\" dialog as shown in the next screenshot:\n\n2. Select template\n\nThis recipe is for a Video with No Menu so we'll hit the \"No template\" button in order to continue.\nInside of DVD Styler we'll notice the left sidebar, the project preview to the right and the contents of the DVD at the very bottom with an item called \"Menu 1\", as shown in the next screenshot:\n\nIMPORTANT! Please don't delete the \"Menu 1\" item. If you do so you may experience some errors when creating the iso or burning the project to a DVD. We'll simply override the menu in the next steps.\n\n3. drag and drop our video\nNow, let's drag and drop our video in the contents area, just aside the \"Menu 1\" item.\n\n\n4. Override DVD-Menu\nNow let's instruct the project to override the menu from appearing and let's place the \"Title 1\" item in first instance in order to make the DVD to start playing the video instead of a Menu. Let's hit the menu \"DVD\" then \"Options\" after which we'll see the \"Properties\" dialog. Let's change the \"First Play Commands\" and set \"jump title 1;\" as shown in the next screenshot:\n\n\n5. Override Menu at the end of the DVD\nNow, let's double click the \"Title 1\" item in order to see the \"Properties - Title 1\" dialog. In that window we'll set the \"Post commands:\" to \"exit;\" instead of \"call last menu;\" as shown in the next screenshot:\n\nThen, hit the \"OK\" button and let's start the oven. \n\n6. Burn\nGo to the \"File\" menu and choose \"Burn DVD\", for the creation of a .iso image we'll use the \"create iso image\" option from the list. The \"preview\" is optional and will only open the video file after transcoded (so you can un-check this).\n\nAfter choosing the right folder where the .iso image file will be saved, let's hit the \"Start\" button.\n\n7.\nA progress window will appear, and at the end of the transcoding, the media player will open the preview and once you close that player, you will be asked if you wish to create an iso image of the video. We should hit the \"Yes\" button, after which a \"Generating was successful\" message in green will appear. Illustration as follows:\n\n\nNext simply hit the \"Close\" button and go to the folder where you requested the iso to be placed. You'll find it right there.\n\nServing\nRemember to serve it cold with a good beverage for the commensal. Oh yeah! You can also burn the iso image with your favorite DVD burner, Brasero is a good choice. :)\nIf you wish to create a new recipe for more videos, just make sure that each item follows the proper \"Post commands\" and the DVD Properties (from DVD/Options menu) is set to \"First Play Commands\" to the menu item.

I'm asking this question because I want to work on my phone, not on my PC in the office.\nI read that Ubuntu can be installed on the Nexus 4, the phone I have, and can be used as a complete PC. I also searched the web for connecting the device to a monitor and I found SlimPort.

A video demonstrating this would be nice.\n\nA: As there are no videos on youtube this feature is probably not yet available. Ubuntu mobile is just a beta/developer version, so I would not recommend using it to work with until it leaves beta status, even if the hdmi connection would work. I think the phone will detect whether it has a screen plugged in and a keyboard connected and then switches the desktop mode by itself. But this is only a guess (and a recommendation not to use a beta to work with), so maybe someone has a more positive answer. \nUpdate There is a first video from canonical showing this feature. It still seems to be relatively slow since it's in beta state. http://www.omgubuntu.co.uk/2013/07/ubuntu-edge-convergence-shown-off\nAs far as I know this feature is not yet enabled in the public release, but unfortunately I can't test it.

Is this to be expected, or an error? I want to install 64b Ubuntu 12.04 LTS into a VM in a 64b Windows 7 machine. The processor is not an AMD so I wonder if I have the right version. \n\nA: it's called amd64 because AMD developed it. Intel developed the old x86 base. This is primarily divided so none of the companies can rule the market and limit it's usage. \nthe amd64 will work any any cpu that is 64-bit capable. \n\nA: Standard computers run x86 architecture cpus, which can be divided into:\n\n\n*\n\n*X86-16, meaning 16bit, \n\n*X86-32, meaning 32bit, which is often refered to as x86 or i386 or IA-32 (Intel Architecture 32bit)\n\n*X86-64, meaning 64bit, which is often refered to as amd64\n\n\nThe reason that many people refer to X86-64 as amd64 is that AMD developed it, which personally I think is not a good enough reason to call it that, after all Intel developed IA64 (Itanium Architecture) and you don't see anyone calling it intel64.\nNeedless to say, that software designed for amd64 is not limited to amd brand cpus, it will run on any X86-64 cpu.\n", "Q: 12.04 - Screen glitches / freezes after \"Lock Screen\" Ubuntu 12.04, 3.5.0-36-generic kernel through LTS Hardware Enablement stack. HD4600 GPU on top of an Intel Core i7-4770.\nWhen I use the \"Lock Screen\" feature of the desktop, sometimes I will go back to the machine hours later and will see one of the following two glitches:\n\n\n*\n\n*the screen is mostly black with a bunch of glitchy graphics on it. I can still move the mouse, can't click on anything though, and nothing happens.\n\n*the system looks unlocked (and if I remember correctly, the monitor is on). Whatever was on the screen before the lock is now fully visible, although you can't click on anything. This has showed my email inbox contents to the rest of the office more than once.\n\n\nThe OS hasn't actually frozen at this point. I usually open a TTY with (CTRL+ALT+F1) and run:\nsudo stop lightdm\nsudo start lightdm\n\nand am able to resume work, even though all of the processes open before (like Firefox, skype etc) seem to be gone.\nFirst of all, is this an known issue and can I fix it?\nSecondly, is there a log somewhere I could look at to see what the specific issue is? /var/log/lightdm didn't reveal much, but I might have been looking in the wrong place.\nAny suggestions would be super welcome.\nWorkaround I stumbled upon: If someone else is running into this issue, there's no reason to reboot the machine when it happens. I think switching to a virtual tty with ALT+CTRL+F1 and then back to ALT+CTRL+F7 seems to fix the problem. Even better, you can avoid it altogether by locking the screen in X and then switching to tty1 when you want to leave the machine alone for some time. Switch back to X when you're back. Hasn't glitched out on me yet, probably because it forces some kind of \"full refresh\" every time you do it.\n\nA: Edit: I wrote a script that works around it by detecting the screen state and automatically switching virtual terminals (same as a manual Ctrl+Alt+F-key sequence) at the right time. Try it out and let me know if it works. I don't use lightdm but maybe we can figure out a way to patch it in. You can get it on GitHub and follow the instructions to use it:\nhttps://github.com/appleYaks/switcher\n\nOld method: only works on laptop lid close.\nIf you're on a laptop, you can make the machine switch ttys automatically when you close and open the lid. This is how I fixed it.

I haven't yet found a way to fix it when the screen shuts off when idle, but I'm happy with this for now.\n\nA: Strange that you have issue with graphics normally it works out of the box without any issues.

It is in use across a number of different applications and domains, most notably on our payloads aboard the International Space Station (ISS). Ubuntu is our primary development and deployment system. All our code is nicely packaged. In the process of building the packages, I would like to run the test suites included in each code base. However...\nOur communication protocol uses Avahi, which in turn uses DBus. Thus our tests use DBus. When building a package, \"fakeroot\" is invoked to solve a number of problems. However, it introduces a problem that I've been unable to solve. When our tests run without fakeroot, we see something like this:\n[pid  3286] sendto(12, \"AUTH EXTERNAL 31303030\\r\\n\", 24, MSG_NOSIGNAL, NULL, 0) = 24\n[pid  3286] read(12, \"OK 38b4600ae82865f9eba81cb700000\"..., 2048) = 37\n\nWhen the same test is run using fakeroot, we see something like this:\n[pid  3280] sendto(12, \"AUTH EXTERNAL 30\\r\\n\", 18, MSG_NOSIGNAL, NULL, 0) = 18\n[pid  3280] read(12, \"REJECTED EXTERNAL DBUS_COOKIE_SH\"..., 2048) = 46\n\nIt turns out that the DBus authentication is simply using the ASCII code of the string representation of the UID for the user. When run normally, the UID is 1000, '1' is 31, '0' is 30; therefore the authentication token for UID 1000 is 31303030. Under fakeroot, the program thinks its UID is 0 and sends the token 30. This is rejected and the whole mess fails.\nThis is connecting to the system DBus and not a session DBus, so I can't just start a new instance inside fakeroot. I've gone through our code, the Avahi code and the DBus code, and don't see any way to work around this.\nSo finally the question - Is there a way to run tests during package building without the fakeroot wrapper? I really want the tests to run, since the code is submitted to a buildbot system that has a wide variety of Linux distributions and versions. This provides much better test coverage than just running the tests on my development system.\n\nA: There are indeed a few test suites which get confused when you run them under fakeroot. You can disable fakeroot for those with something like that in debian/rules:\noverride_dh_auto_test:\n            env -u LD_PRELOAD dh_auto_test\n\nThis is right if your test suite is simply \"make check\" and you use reasonably modern packaging. The gist is to unset $LD_PRELOAD.\nHowever, please note that you can not rely on the system D-BUS running during package build. Init scripts and the like are usually disabled in build environments using policy-rc.d, so if your tests want a system bus they need to start one themselves (dbus-launch, and export DBUS_SYSTEM_BUS_ADDRESS=$DBUS_SESSION_BUS_ADDRESS).\n", "Q: What is the differences between RPM package manager and Alien software? An app required me to install RPM package to install .rpm files. But as far as I know, there is another software called \"alien\". What is the difference between this two? I couldn't manage to find on search engines.\n\nA: First, to address your situation:\nMost of the time when an application is provided as an RPM package, it is also provided in some other way that is more likely to work on Ubuntu. As you may know, Ubuntu uses DEB packages. It's possible to (attempt to) install an RPM package on Ubuntu, but RPM packages are really intended for systems that use RPM as their package manager, like Fedora, CentOS, Mandriva, and Mageia (that's a far from complete list).\nTherefore, you should try to find a DEB package for the software. If there isn't one, then you should try to find a system-agnostic binary installer (which won't necessarily be named ending in .run), or compile the application from source (see also this guide).\nIf those options aren't available either or you want to try installing from an RPM package anyway (for example, if you've heard that for this particular software the RPM package will work on Ubuntu), read on...\nrpm vs. alien\ndpkg (WP) is Ubuntu's package manager.\nThe surrounding infrastructure, such as APT, the Software Center, and the Software Updater, which automatically check for and fetch packages from software sources, may also be considered \"the package manager,\" but dpkg is what installs and uninstalls packages and keeps track of what packages are installed at what versions (often being called behind the scenes by other utilities to perform these functions).\nrpm (WP) is another, separate package manager. Where Ubuntu uses dpkg, some other OSes use rpm. It's possible to use multiple package managers on the same system, and you can run rpm on Ubuntu. But generally speaking, when you (try to) install an rpm package on an Ubuntu system, you don't gain most of the benefits of using package management, because \"this package depends on that package\" relationships are generally neither determined nor respected across multiple package managers. That is, if there is a dependency or conflict that would require dpkg (and the surrounding infrastructure) to install, remove, upgrade, or perform some other action with a package, rpm will not know that, and rpm will not trigger that.\nalien (WP) is a utility that attempts to convert a .rpm package into a .deb package that can be installed on your system, with the hope that it will integrate properly into the dpkg-based package management system. Optionally, alien can also automatically attempt to install that file. (More generally, alien can perform conversions the other way, and supports some other package formats too, besides .deb and .rpm.)\nIn practice, as Call me V says, installing .rpm packages with alien often doesn't tend to work very well. Certainly not as well as if the software's developer made a .deb package. But it's usually better to use alien to install an .rpm package on Ubuntu, than to try to install it using the rpm utility.\nOf course, if alien fails or the installed package doesn't work properly, you can always try uninstalling it and then installing the .rpm package with rpm. Or as bodhi.zazen explains, you can try manually extracting files from an .rpm package and copying them to the necessary locations.\nHow to use them:\nIf you have a package called foo.rpm in the current directory (i.e., you have cd'd to the directory that contains it) and want to use alien to create and attempt to install a .deb package from it, you could run:\nsudo alien -di foo.rpm\nIf you wanted to try to install foo.rpm directly with rpm, you could run:\nrpm -i foo.rpm\nFurther Reading\nFor more information, see the alien and rpm manual pages, and the alien and rpm websites.\nSee also our rpm tag wiki (which also includes information about alien).\n\nA: Packages are made from source code and are used to install the compiled applications (typically). The source code can be processed (packaged) in a variety of ways and is used by your package management system to install the package (if that makes sense).\nEach distro uses a packaging system and naming convention, Ubuntu and Debian use .deb (apt). Fedora (RHEL, Centos, SUSE) use .rpm.\nSee the various packaging guides for details.\nhttp://developer.ubuntu.com/packaging/html/\nhttp://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Packaging:Guidelines\nAlien is an application that attempts to convert one package format (.rpm) to another (.deb). There are options beyond .deb and .rpm as well, but that is a little beyond this question.\nSee: http://manpages.ubuntu.com/manpages/raring/man1/alien.1p.html\nThe problem is that although a package might be called the same, say \"firefox\", due to naming conventions, the libraries within and across packages may not be named the same between various distributions or may be incompatible across distributions. Even if they have the same name they may not be identical. Some libs are symbolic links. In addition, packaging may include pre/post installation scripts and/or configuration files. The installation scripts might not be easily converted (by alien). The configuration files might be different (for example init or boot scripts). \nAlien therefore may work for \"simple\" packages, but often fails or is error prone for more complex packages.\nIf you need to install a package, imo, you are better off either extracting the .rpm or compiling from source.\nThe .rpm is an archive, like a zip file, and the contents can be extracted, reviewed, and manually installed.\nhttp://www.cyberciti.biz/tips/how-to-extract-an-rpm-package-without-installing-it.html\nYou extract the files, and manually copy them to the appropriate location in your system.\nSee also: https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Package_management_system\n\nA: alien tries to convert rpms to debs.  which means it tries to make native packaging work.  unfortunately it's a lot like a half-witted translator.  which means that at least half the time you'll get the wrong translation.\nessentially this means that, while alien is an epic attempt at awesome, you will have varied results using it to get rpms under deb file management.\n\nA: RPM is the package format for Red Hat derived distributions.\nAlien is an application that convert between RPM and DEB packages.  The converted package may or may not work in your system.\nYou can find more info about both package formats and alien in this pdf.\nTBOL_2011_1_RPM_DEM_US.pdf\nNow the other issue.  You are trying to install a RPM based package on your Ubuntu I guess.  Well that's not a good idea.  You should try in the program site, or app developer to find if there is an Ubuntu/Debian package and try that instead, or a universal Linux package (usually end in .run), or compile from sources.\n", "Q: How to upgrade a particular package dependencies only?

As I understand it, this is because each OS is stored on its own dedicated drive.\nMy question is this: if I were to set up a desktop with 2x hard drives, one for Ubuntu and the other for Windows, would it be possible to set this up in a way that I could switch between the two without ever having to log out? I see plenty of posts on here stating that I can set it up so I can choose between either OS or hard drive at the boot screen, but I'm interested in being able to switch with a simple keyboard shortcut, not unlike switching between programs using ALT+tab. Anyone have any ideas?\n\nA: Short answer is no, you cannot run two operating systems at the same time, because you have no way to boot both of them simaltaneously, even if you did overcome that hiccup they would both be fighting to control your hardware. I'm not saying it isn't possible, I'm just saying until windows and ubuntu are written to support such a feature (which is unlikely) you can't do it. That said, the technology already sort of exists, windows 8 has a new feature called fast-boot which means that every computer in the world running windows 8 never turns off completely, unless the administrator disables fast-boot, windows 8 is setup to maintain partial hardware control even when you boot into another operating system like ubuntu, which is known to cause some issues. \nYou might consider running windows and ubuntu in Virtual machines? That way can switch between them anytime and run them at the same time. I recommend VMware Player because it has the best graphics card emulation out of all the products I've tried, however if you want more features, then try virtual box. If you aren't familair with virtual machines, you can think of them as a program you install that pretends to be a computer, you can install operating systems into it attach virtual and real hardware to it (limitations apply), and use it like a real computer.\nYou could also try coLinux, or andlinux which are modified versions of linux designed to run within windows, however they only support 32bit windows, and there are limitations to what you can do, also the linux softare will not have access to your graphics capabilities, and some other hardware.\nsincerely, tapthoseshoesandwish\n", "Q: Battery icon is not displayed on the gnome shell 3 desktop.

Now you can just drag files to the target directory.\n\n*You can use rsync to synchronize whole folders, keeping modification times etc. This is one of the most useful commands.\n\n*Five, five, not four. You can use sshfs to mount your ssh-accessible filesystem like a network drive:\nsudo apt-get install sshfs\nmkdir ~/remote\nsshfs user@server:/path/to/dir ~/remote\n\nYou now can navigate to the remote folder in your home directory and use whatever local commands or tool to copy the files.\n", "Q: I want to install Fedora in Virtual Box with a Usb stick I managed to install Virtual Box on my Ubuntu system; now I want to install Fedora within the virtual machine.

Instead of using cookies, both above mentioned searching engines allow to do ones settings (language, searching results etc.) and generete an URL of it. I would like to use these URLs as chooseable searching engines in the right corner of my Firefox browser, where I also can choose for instance Google, Wikipedia and so on.\nI'm using Ubuntu 13.04 with its special/customized Firefox (22).\nThe problem is:\n1) If directly on the pages of the searching engines Ixquick and Startpage with the specially generated for me URL, I choose \"Add to Firefox\", then on \"Install\" - and nothing happens. With both the https version, which I would prefer, and the http version. So, to add these searching engines directly from their web pages to Firefox, seems not possible.\n2) Then I tried to search in Firefox for \"Add Ons\". There, I found Ixquick and Startpage, however, not with my preferenceds, but the normal page versions, and unfortunately, just in English.

There are initial packages but it's not ready to be in the distribution. There is also a Debian wiki page about the packaging effort.\nIt alludes to the fact that Rust's compiler is written in Rust so the bootstrapping process is strange, so perhaps that's why it's not packaged yet.\nThere are some issues in upstream Rust that make it hard to package.  Bootstrapping is apparently not a catastrophic problem as packagers can start from a binary snapshot.\n\nUpdated May 2016: Happily, rustc is now in Debian testing, so should be in Ubuntu within a year or so.\n", "Q: Awkward Fonts in Ubuntu 13.04 I have installed Ubuntu 13.04 in Vmware Workstation.

If nothing is wrong with your iso, edit the ques. with every specific detail of your computer and check for supported hardware on ubuntu and linux kernel website.\nIf the installer messed up your partition table (backups, backups, where are you), try restoring it with a tool like TestDisk, there are alot of howtos on the web to help you.\nIf, luckily, you made backups before the installation (the whole disk backups that even backup your mbr and partition table), just restore the backups and try again (with a new iso?).\nBut, as you said, you have important stuff on there, use your liveCD to boot into a live (not installation) environment and get your stuff out of there first (that is if your partition table is intact)\nFinally, before you try again, MAKE BACKUPS? You must understand how important they are and remember to make them before messing around risky stuff and there are enough websites to teach you how to do that.\nHope I helped :)\n", "Q: Ubuntu doesn't detect my Bluetooth receiver, how to fix it? \nRead first\nThis is a Canonical question that will be signpost to solve Bluetooth issues.

Our lead architect tells me we should not use VI to view log files. Instead use cat.\nI want to know if there is any inherent risk associated with using vi/vim to view log files.\n\nA: There's nothing inherently wrong with using vi (or vim) as a viewer only, if you are disciplined enough not to accidentally write to the file.\nIf you accidentally write to a log file you may lose any new log file entries made since you opened it (although vim may in some cases warn you of this).  You may also lose data due to confusion when the log file rotates.  Log file rotation is a process where the old logfile's filename is automatically changed (or deleted, or compressed) and a new logfile is started.\n\n\n*\n\n*An alternative to vim that is only a viewer (cannot edit) is less - and it has vim-like controls too for scrolling and searching.  I find it a good program for viewing log files, or lists in general such as lengthy output of commands, because of its vim-like controls and search ability.\n\n*Another good alternative is tail because it allows you to view just the last portion of the file, and has a follow mode which can stay active and display additional content as it's added to the log file.  It's also aware of log rotation so it can keep displaying new entries after a log file rotation.  To use the rotation-aware follow mode you use tail -F mylogfile.log and you can stop it with just Ctrl+C.\n\nA: Vi is a powerful editor when used by an experienced user, but it is not inconceivable that a novice user might accidentally delete or otherwise modify the log file.  It might be that your architect is afraid of this happening.\nHaving said that, a user should not have write permission on most log files anyway.  My guess is that your architect thinks that commands like less, cat, more are simply more expedient than starting a text editor.\n\nA: Going along with the other good answers, perhaps more in keeping with the intent of \"using vim\" that was asked in the question:\nTrying using view\nThis symlink just starts vim in read-only mode and is available by default in Ubuntu for as long as I remember.\n", "Q: \"df -h ~\" thinks my drive is full, but it shouldn't even be half way.

However, the command /etc/syslog-ng/syslog-ng.conf, is returning:\n -bash:/etc/syslog-ng/sylog-ng.conf: Permission denied \n\nWhat can I do to access the configuration file.\n\nA: By typing just /etc/syslog-ng/syslog-ng.conf in the command prompt, you are telling your shell to run the file. However, since the file has not been marked as executable (and it should not be, as it's a configuration file!), you'll get an error message. You would get the same error message by trying to run any file that does not have the +x bit set.\nThe file should be opened in a text editor. Configuration files residing in /etc are system-wide and editing them is restricted to the superuser only. By typing in sudo gedit /etc/syslog-ng/syslog-ng.conf and entering your password when asked, you'll get a text editor to edit the file and save any changes you'll make.\n\nA: Type your command with sudo before:\nsudo <command>\n\nsudo allows a permitted user to execute a command as the superuser/root, as specified by the security policy.\nAlso, when you want to execute something from a file, be sure that the file can be executed with:\nchmod +x <file>\n\n\nA: If you want to modify the file, you need to use an editor.

When that happens, contents of the computers RAM are \"swapped\" to the HDD, which is orders of magnitude slower than RAM, leading to generally very bad performance.\nThere are many possible reasons for filled up memory. The two most probable ones:\n\n\n*\n\n*The most probable one is that the Ubuntu desktop is too heavy for your computer. \n\n\n*\n\n*If you have less than 4 GB of RAM, Ubuntu 12.04 64bit is hardly usable (Been there, done that...). Since 32bit is supposed to use less memory, you could instead use the 32bit edition of Ubuntu. \n\n*You can try to use RAM saving apps instead of memory eaters. Use Claws-Mail instead of Evolution for E-Mail, xpdf or ePDFviewer instead of evince, Gnome Browser (aka epiphany-browser) instead of Firefox, mousepad, leafpad or even emacs or vim instead of gedit,...\n\n*Another option is to use a more lightweight desktop. Xfce and Lxde are good candidates, because they work well without desktop effects (which use easily more than 200 MB RAM). If you are also looking for a selection of RAM saving apps, you can install the lubuntu-desktop or xubuntu-desktop packages or start with Xubuntu/Lubuntu directly. (There are also other Distributions designed to be even more lightweight.)\n\n*This problem can also be simply \"solved\" by adding more RAM to your PC ;-)\n\n\n*Another possible cause is a bug in a running program, a so called \"memory leak\".\n\n\n*\n\n*You can check the memory usage for instance by running top in terminal. To sort for real (residual) RAM usage, press upper case O and then select the RES field (probably by pressing q). There are of course many other options to check memory usage. If there is a single program using lots and lots of RES, you can be almost certain that something is not OK with that software. In such a case, please write a bug report and if possible, avoid using that program until a fix is released.\n\n*If on the other hand a driver is having a memory leak, it will not be shown in top. If you are lucky, you can use slabtop to identify which kernel data structure is using RAM (maybe slabtop has to be run with sudo). Especially the proprietary nVidia driver has has an extremely bad memory leak in Ubuntu 9.? causing it to make a computer unusable within hours, no matter how much RAM a system had. If it's the graphics driver, you can switch between proprietary and open source. For drivers that come with the kernel, changing the kernel is probably the only option.\n\n\n", "Q: Triple boot Windows 7, 8 and Ubuntu 13.04 I have got a new computer and I want to install Windows 7, Windows 8 and Ubuntu 13.04 on it, In which order should I install them?? I tried installing Windows 7 first then Windows 8 and finally Ubuntu 13.04 but it shows only Windows 7, 8 during boot. Can anyone please provide exact steps to be followed while installing.\n\nA: The order you used is correct. First install all Windows versions you like, from the oldest to the newest. This will ensure that all of them are automatically added to the Windows Bootloader. Then install other operating systems. If you start with operating systems other than Windows, their Bootloader will be deleted during Windows installation.\nThe two most likely reasons that you can't boot Ubuntu are:\n\n\n*\n\n*If your computer is using UEFI (nearly all new computers do), you have to install all operating systems with the same firmware interface: UEFI or BIOS. If your computer has UEFI, read the UEFI help page.\n\n*You might have installed the Ubuntu bootloader to a different hard drive than the one, the computer boots from. If you think this might be the case, have a look at boot repair. Usually the bootloader has to be installed directly to the first hard drive, sda. If you haven't been asked during installation, where to install the bootloader, it should have been installed to the correct location.\n\n\nA: 1.Download  Boot-Repair disk,2.burn the iso file to dvd or usb3.Boot it4.click Recommended Repair.

My system is on Ubuntu 12.04\n\nA: The first step of the instructions you're following says \"First make sure you’re desktop working environment is at least 13.10 / saucy\".\nThe PPA that you are trying to add currently only contains packages for Saucy, which accounts for the error you received.  While you could potentially rebuild those packages for 12.04, there are almost certainly other dependencies that are not satisfied by what is in that version.\nIt is possible that someone will backport Unity 8 to that version in the future, but while it is under heavy development, your best bet is to use what the developers are working with.\n", "Q: Is there a way to connect with the real router(server) from the fake one?

Just don't allow people on your home network if they cannot configure their devices correctly.\nWhen configuring addresses manually, people tend to choose them from the low end of the address space. You could move your gateway to .254, set your DHCP pool to .100 - .199 and keep statically allocated addresses in the low end of your subnet. Remeber to document everything (a single post-it will do!) so that people don't reuse existing allocations.\nYou could also set the ARP tables manually on the PCs to point 192.168.1.2 to the eth1 interface of S/R. On the Linux PCs, run sudo arp -i <iface> -s 192.168.1.2 <macaddr> where <iface> is the Ethernet interface, likely eth0. <macaddr> is the hardware MAC address of the eth1 adapter on S/R, which you can find by running ifconfig eth1 on the server.\nIf you are a professional network admin, you likely already have the skills and hardware budget to keep misconfigured hosts from disrupting the network.\n\nA: /etc/network/interfaces\n...\n\niface eth0 inet dhcp\npost-up arp -i <iface> -s 192.168.1.2 <macaddr>    \n\n...\n\n", "Q: How do I change awn dialect applet style?

I use xubuntu 12.04 and the check box should be under properties> permissions.\n\nA: The option, to make a file executable is only shown for programs that the file manager considers to be of an executable file type. Jar-files are not in that list, although on Ubuntu setting them executable allows you to run them (maybe this should be reported as a bug?). Depending on the settings used when compiling the kernel (or generally on other operating systems), setting jar files executable might not work, and I guess this is the reason why file managers don't consider them runnable.\nSo, your options are:\n\n\n*\n\n*Use the command line tool chmod to add the execute permission. (chmod +x <filename>)\n\n*Don't care about execute permissions and just always run java -jar <filename>. \n\n*\n\n*You can create a launcher icon that runs this command.\n\n*You can create a write a wrapper shell script that can then be set executable. Most java programs available in the Ubuntu repositories install such a wrapper to /usr/bin, while the jar files reside in /usr/share/java\n\n\n", "Q: ccsm/window rules/size rules: can window be maximized vertically?

I can't use mainline kernel 3.11 (which supposedly includes the patch) because there are no nVidia drivers that work yet.\nBefore applying the patch I run make oldconfig and left everything as default pressing enter a bunch of times. Then I applied the patch and run that command again and it asked about Huion driver with options [N,m], I pressed N for NEW I think... \nSome people got it working with this patch, not me. How can I know if the patch was applied and that this device is supposed to get detected? Do I have to load the driver manually somehow? \nEdit: Compiling kernel again pressing m this time, let's see how this goes...\n\nA: I finally got it working. First download kernel 3.9.10, extract and apply patch:\n> cd linux-3.9.10\n> yes \"\" | make oldconfig\n> patch -p1 < ../path/to/huion.patch\n> make oldconfig\n  Huion tablets (HID_HUION) [N/m/?] m\n> fakeroot make-kpkg -j 4 --initrd --append-to-version=elclanrs kernel-image kernel-headers\n  ...\n\nAfter that I installed the packaged debs, rebooted and everything works now, uname -a reports custom kernel.\nFinally I had to restrict the tablet to only one monitor, the right one in this case.

Sound issues in Linux are mostly because of bad mixer status. \nInstall and check alsamixer or pavucontrol and check the mixer. In mixers look for any muted volumes and also test right/left sliders; sometimes some sound hardware (mostly microphones) only works when mixer is set to only left channel.\n\nA: This issue can be resolved by upgrading the kernel. Which might break the Wifi driver for this model tho.\n", "Q: Better Way to Convert Partition From Ext4 to Ext2? (including encrypted home) So I ran into a situation the other day.  I needed to revert my ext4 Ubuntu installation to a ext2.This is because I am using TrueCrypt and an alternative boot loader than grub2. I have later been able to successfully encrypt the entire disk from TrueCrypt using the \"entire disk method.\"So my setup is a Win7 partition, two Ubuntu partitions (one ext2, the other is an encrypted swap (Ubuntu 13.04)))\nWhat I ended up doing after unsuccessfully following many different posts about converting partitions is....1.  I backed up my original ext4 partition to an external drive.2.  I then copied with \"cp -ax\" from the ext4 partition to the new ext2 partition I created.3.  Then I used a live cd (really usb stick) to \"sudo su && nautilus &!\"4.  After that I hit ctrl+h and then copied everything I found in the /home/olduser folder to the new /home/newuser folder graphically.\nIt seems to have worked, but I feel like this was most likely more than I needed to do to successfully accomplish my task.  Any suggestions to downgrade a partition as I have described?  This has allowed me to use TrueCrypt to encrypt the entire drive, I first boot using the TrueCrypt boot loader, enter my password, then load the Win7 boot loader which I have edited to have Win7, WinXP, and Ubuntu(the Ubuntu entry was added using \"NeoSmart Tech. EasyBCD\" This is what required an ext2 partition to be able to find the Ubuntu setup.) entries. Then everything works like a charm!  Thank you in advance for this untypical setup response!\n\nA: That's pretty much it; you have to reformat to downgrade from ext4 to ext2.  I'm not sure why you copied the home directory though.\n", "Q: Mistakenly deleted files recursively from '/' on my still running server I mistakenly deleted the bin folder, now most of the bin cmds do not exist. The server  still works just fine but I know when I restart it, I will not like it. How can I fix this without losing system configurations and data.\nfrom comment:\nI was trying to reinstall roundcube on the server and deleting the previous conf file. I had switched into the directory and instead of entering rm -R . I typed rm -R /* Realizing this I quickly cancelled the rm and unfortunately the /bin was already gone.\n\nA: By running the command rm -R /* you told it to recursively delete all, starting from /. This is likely very much more than just /bin.\nYour server now is in a highly unstable state and needs restore from backup.\nOnly in case you have no backups, and your system is on an ext3 or ext4 partition, and you can still run it (which is not very likely I am afraid), you may try to recover files using extundelete but you may not be able to recover all files, at least not to an extent to have a reliably stable system back.\n", "Q: how to get to settings of adobe flash player?

I have an HP PC running Ubuntu 12.04. When I left-click with my mouse, it sometimes double-clicks (maybe 50% of the time). \nSo far this has led to: randomly sending unfinished emails, randomly highlighting and deleting things I didn't want to delete whilst writing emails (very frustrating), randomly deleting two browser tabs instead of one (several times), and (in some sense the most annoying) a very very frustating end-user experience when attempting to move windows around on the desktop or to cut-and-paste from a terminal window. Thank goodness for Alt-F7 — but I don't want to have to learn keyboard shortcuts for every program I use as well as for the OS (and not being able to copy-paste is a great loss for me).\nI am not the only person with this problem, but googling indicates that there may well be multiple reasons for it; none of the fixes I have read online have worked for me. Let me go through everything, including fixes that have worked for other people but not for me. Oh — I have an hp optical mouse.\n\n\n*\n\n*It is not a broken mouse. I have tried two mice on my system — both exhibit the problem. Both of these mice work fine on my home laptop also running Ubuntu 12.04.\n\n*My /etc/X11/xorg.conf is only a few lines long and has no \"InputDevice\" section.\n\n*I don't have hald, or the hal package installed.\n\n*It started about a week ago, and doesn't seem to be getting any better or worse. \n\n*In desperation I just upgraded to 12.10 but this has not fixed the problem and now I am running a distro that is not an LTS (and hence is not ideal for me :-\\ )\nBut it is rendering my system very hard to use. \nPossibly important update: I tried doing some investigations with xev. It seems to me that it looks like a bad connection in these mice -- is this common? I can hold down the mouse button, and then get (mouse click) (pause) (mouse release) (very very short pause) (mouse click) (pause) (mouse release) (very very short pause) (mouse click) etc. I wonder whether e.g. other operating systems say \"you can't release and then click again within 0.05 seconds, so that must have been a glitch and I'll assume the button was never released\". Can I tell Ubuntu to ignore release-and-then-reclick-almost-instantly events??\nThis so looks like a bad mouse issue. Maybe I should dig out a newer mouse? I've only tried very old ones :-\\ \n\nA: I've built a patched xserver-xorg-input-evdev for Ubuntu 14.10. I used the instructions from http://blog.guntram.de/?p=16 (patch can be found here and here) and a Debian packaging manual.\nHere are my notes about building a package.\n#!/bin/bash\n# http://blog.guntram.de/?p=16\n#\n\napt-get build-dep xserver-xorg-input-evdev\n\ndquilt=\"quilt --quiltrc=${HOME}/.quiltrc-dpkg\"\n\nwget --output-document=evdev-debounce.patch http://blog.guntram.de/?ddownload=20\napt-get source xserver-xorg-input-evdev\n\ncd xserver-xorg-input-evdev-*\n\n$dquilt new debounce.patch\n$dquilt add include/evdev-properties.h src/Makefile.am src/debounce.c src/evdev.c src/evdev.h src/debounce.c\npatch -p1 <../evdev-debounce.patch\n\n$dquilt refresh\n$dquilt header -e\n\ndebuild -us -uc -b\ncd ..\n\nsudo dpkg -i xserver-xorg-input-evdev_*.deb\n\n\n\n*\n\n*Good news: it worked.\n\n*Bad news: it doesn't always help. My mouse button contact was so bad that it needed a 200ms delay, which stops me from double-clicking. Another bouncing mouse began working fine.\n\n\nedit: Thanks @MatijaNalis, the patch obtaining steps could be: \nwget https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/xf/xf86-input-evdev-debounce/xf86-input-evdev-debounce.tar.gz\ntar xzf xf86-input-evdev-debounce.tar.gz\n# ...\npatch -p1 < ../xf86-input-evdev-debounce/debounce.patch\n\n\nA: OK after extensive testing using xev on the affected machine, and switching around between various mice on various systems, I believe I have solved this problem. Of course YMMV.\nMy solution: it is a broken mouse. \nMore precisely, the connector activated when clicking is a bit old or dirty or something, and sometimes, when holding the button down, the connection is made, and then momentarily broken, and then made again, causing the double click.\n\nObjection: But the mouse works fine when I plug it into my Windows machine!\nCounter: Wouldn't it be just trivial to put into a driver, or an OS, the following line of pseudocode: \"if the user unclicks the mouse and then clicks it again within 0.05 seconds, then that's probably a dirty connector, so let's just ignore that\". Thus isn't it possible that if you switch your mouse to another computer running another OS and/or using another driver on different hardware (even with the same OS you could well be using different hardware, right?), you could get different results?\nObjection: But I tried another old mouse and it exhibited the same problem!\nCounter: amazing how two old mice from the same company can both break in the same way, eh? And you never noticed because that second old mouse you tried was exhibiting no problems when plugged into different hardware (see previous counter).\n\nIf you really don't believe your mouse is broken, then test it:\n$ xev\n\nand then find the square with the black background, click in it, and watch the output. Do you definitely, always, get one clean \"click\" and nothing else? I would often get a clean click but occasionally a \"bounce \"(click unclick click). Even better perhaps:\n$ xev | grep ButtonRelease\n\nNow stick the mouse into the square with the black outline (or anywhere in that window) and click and unclick 20 times. You should get a \"ButtonRelease\" line every time you release the button, and never otherwise. I would occasionally get one when I clicked. \nNightmare over.\n\nA: The problem, explained by Jack Ganssle, here: http://www.eng.utah.edu/~cs5780/debouncing.pdf\n - contact bounce filtering. The software thingy needs to be there in any application, from simple single-board computers to operating systems, in some form.\nhttps://www.google.se/?gfe_rd=cr&safe=off#q=%2Bcontact+%2Bbounce+%2Bsoftware&safe=off\nAs contacts / buttons get older, the effect will get worse. WD40 might not be the best spray to use on electronics, there are others more suiting. Google 'Contact spray'.\n\nA: I had a problem with an additional button clicking twice. \nAs I already had it  mapped with xbindkeys (see How can I assign actions to all my mouse buttons? for more information on that) my solution was changing the entry in the ~/.xbindkeysrc as follows:\n\"if [ ! -e /dev/shm/button ]; then touch /dev/shm/button; /usr/bin/xte 'keydown Control_L' 'key Page_Down' 'keyup Control_L'; sleep 0.2; rm  /dev/shm/button; fi\"\nb:7\n\nThis creates a \"lockfile\" for every button press in /dev/shm/(which I hope lies on RAM) and removes it after 0.2 seconds. \nAnd the xte command shall be done on mouse click and shall not be done twice in 0.2 seconds.\n(Just thought I'd share my solution, in case anybody want's to copy it or to fix it.)\n\nA: In my case it was hardware or, more precisely, some mechanical problem with mouse button micro switch.\nI had this problem with 2 mice: the old one Logitech m-uv69 and some another mouse I've bought about a year ago and I managed to repair both of them without much effort. This is what I have done:\n\n\n*\n\n*took off mouse top cover\n\n*directly quickly pushed micro switch small button many times\n\n\nAfter that almost all unintentional doubleclicks gone away. I don't know what exactly caused them inside micro switch. Probably it got dirty or something and quickly pushing it makes the dirt go away.\n\nA: Spray WD40 is magic for many problems, inclusive volume wheel in headphones with rac rac rac noises, also for repair this problem of mouse clicks…\nTest, is a very fast, not need open the mouse or open the headphones, spray and go well another time…\n\nA: There is a software bug and as of June 2014 there is no fix for it.  It does not happen on all mice modles.  My logitech mice are fine but most other fail no matter what you do.\nThis is for RHEL, CentOS and Ubuntu. All the mice work on pure windows boxes but the same issue is there in KVM's\nNo Solution yet, Developers do know about it.\nCheers.\nDon.\n\nA: Zen and mouse maintenance.  Seems many are having a problem with the mouse double clicking when one click is applied.  The mouse button is a micro switch. The fact of life is that switch contacts bounce.   They don’t actually bounce but rub.  We will call it bounce anyway.  For some reason the programmers have dropped the ball on this one.  A wait loop of sufficient duration should be applied for the contacts to settle before reading.\nApropos of nothing and on a sample of one my solution has been to place a capacitor across the switch contacts.  I used a 0.1uF cap for no particular reason other than I had one in a small size that would fit inside the mouse nicely.  I haven’t done any fancy analyses of dwell time, time constants or decision levels to find an optimum value.  Various models will have different parameters anyway.\nI have been using this modification for some time and the problem hasn’t resurfaced so far.\nTo apply the mod.  Find a capacitor of small physical dimensions that will fit inside to mouse case.  I used a 0.1uF because I had one and it is a nice number but other values will probably work but don’t go too large or too small.  What is too large or small is a matter for experiment.   Too large may affect intended double clicks, too small won’t achieve the desired effect. I soldered one leg of the cap at a convenient location, where it didn’t run foul of the inside structure of the mouse, on the copper side of the board, to the 0 volt plane (earth plane if you wish) I hooked the other leg of the cap to the switch active with a bit of thin wire.  I used a recycled component with short legs.  A new one would likely have long enough legs to reach to where it is needed.  You will need a suitable fine tipped soldering iron for the job.\nIf you don’t know capacitors.  A 0.1uF capacitor may be designated 0.1uF or 104 or 100nF or have brown black yellow coloured bands.  A surface mount type would be a good choice also.  Hook it in with some strands of fine wire.  Could glue it to the board connection side up.\nI have a plan B which I may try next time or if the current plan eventually fails.  Ditching the micro switch for a spst PCB mount tactile membrane switch should solve the problem.  That is the type of switch used in keyboards and key pads and don’t exhibit this problem.  The foot print it nothing like the micro switch. A switch 7mm high is available which will come in at the same height as the existing micro switch.  A smaller switch would need to be spaced up to the correct height. Bend the legs at right angles to the switch body and glue it to the board so that the actuator aligns with the position occupied by the micro switch actuator.  The mouse button has to hit the correct spot.  Wire the switch contacts in with some fine wire and all should be good in theory. \n", "Q: Alternative systray 13.04 has dropped support for old-style systray indicators. This may or may not be a step in the right direction in the long term, but it's extremely inconvenient in the short term. \nThere are at least four apps that I regularly use that have a systray icon, and half of those are completely unusable without it. I going to need a work-around to get by.\nIn the old days it used to be possible to run a gnome-panel in a Unity desktop, and get the old gnome2 widgets and indicators that way.

When you have these two...plug in your flash drive...and run the rufus executable from your desktop. Then use rufus to create a bootable flash, specifying the Ubuntu Image file you would've downloaded as the operation system you want to use.\n  Make sure that you choose the \"ntfs\" option during creation of your bootable usb. The start the creation process.\n  After its done, eject your flash disk and re-plug it onto your samsung machine.\n  Run the executable in the flash,(wubi.exe) and then it should give an option of trying and installing ubuntu.

Very annoying because I really can't work with the unit as the touchpad keeps being very \"touchy\", a single slight touch with my palm is enough to move the cursor away while I'm typing stuff on the keyboard. \nOn a fresh install, I have the \"Systeme > Souris et pavé tactil\" (sorry, it's in french!) utility with the checkbox \"disable while typing\". Doesn't work.\nSo I installed gpointing-devices-settings via the Ubuntu Software Center (gsynaptics isn't maintained anymore, I read it somewhere).\n \nSounds like gpointingdevices handles my touchpad, but the options I check/uncheck are not persistent. Each time I re-launch gpointingdevices, it's back in the default configuration. \nAnother way to deal with the touchpad is to use syndaemon in a command line with some parameters to disable touchpad and all (see http://www.webupd8.org/2009/11/ubuntu-automatically-disable-touchpad.html for configurations). But in my fresh install, when I launch syndameon, whatever the parameters are, it just seems to destroy the handling of the touchpad, that is, no more two fingers scrolling and no more \"tap to click\". I must reload the session to get it working again.\nSo I'm quite in a mist of conjecture for now: is it a bug specific to the Macbook Pro touchpads? Or am I not pushing the right buttons? Or what? Next to Unity, my main deskop environment, I installed Cynnamon desktop, maybe some package in it is messing up the touchpad settings?\n\nA: Well, I think I may have found a solution, with a direct edition of the paremeters for the touchpad from the g-conf-editor. \nYou have first to install G-conf-editor from the Ubuntu Software Center or via the terminal (sudo apt-get install gconf-editor).\nThen switch to the subfolder Desktop > Gnome > Periphericals > bcm5974 where you can check or uncheck the options you need. I checked everything: disable_tapping, palm_detection, palm_detection_depth, palm_detection_width. \nAfter one hour writing stuff with LibreOffice, seems like the touchpad is disabled at last when typping...  \n\n", "Q: Ubuntu 13.04, connected to WiFi, but no internet access I have a fresh install of Ubuntu 13.04 desktop (installed yesterday). WiFi has been working fine for many hours, suddenly I can no longer load any pages. I have another laptop running Windows 8 which I'm now using next to my Ubuntu laptop, and wifi is working fine.

The function DaysMinutes does this and was copied from my ~/.bashrc file where you may want to put that function yourself.\n\nHow it works\nThe key component is getting suspend start and end times from journalctl:\n$ journalctl -b-0 | grep -E 'systemd\\[1]: Start.*Suspend'\nOct 31 05:55:19 alien systemd[1]: Starting Suspend...\nOct 31 16:54:26 alien systemd[1]: Started Suspend.\n (...

You could enhance the function to look at the previous boot using -b-1 the boot before that with -b-2, etc.\n\n*The grep command with regex does the heavy lifting returning 32 system messages pertaining to suspend from the 19,330 system messages recorded (on my system)\n\n\nA: After years the above script requires an update. systemd messages and date command are not compatible anymore - as explained in the comments to the upper script.

On one I have Windows, on the other I have Ubuntu 12.04. Everything works fine. Now, I want to install one more hard drive. This is an IDE drive. After installing the IDE drive, Grub no longer points to the correct hard drive and doesn't find the boot directory, so I end up in grub rescue. In my grub.cfg the Ubuntu installation is on hd1. It seems that the new IDE drive becomes hd0. Does that mean that my Ubuntu (and the boot directory) now is on hd2 (and Windows on hd1)? If so, how can I change this in Grub so that it points to the correct hard drive? Can it be done from the grub rescue prompt? Can I boot without the IDE drive installed, edit grub.cfg, torn off the computer, connect the IDE drive and boot? If I go wrong here, can I edit grub.cfg from a live CD? Or is there a better way to do this?\n\nA: Grub command line have some commands that will help you to debug this issue. Check for the list of them here: http://www.gnu.org/software/grub/manual/html_node/Command_002dline-and-menu-entry-commands.html\nIn your case you must identify the drive and the partition where your Grub files are located. Try ls command. Bear in mind that partition naming convention is different in Grub. For example, 2nd partition of the 1st drive will be called (hd0,1) (drives and partitions are counted starting from zero). Check \"Device syntax\" section in the help for ls command using the mentioned link.\nAs soon as you'll know exactly where /boot/grub folder is located, you can try to boot your system using the next commands (I'm using the previous example with Drive 1, Partition 2 - change them appropriately):\ngrub> set root=(hd0,1)\ngrub> set prefix=(hd0,1)/boot/grub\ngrub> insmod normal\ngrub> normal\n\nNow your system should boot normally. Log in and restore your boot loader from the terminal:\nsudo update-grub\nsudo grub-install /dev/sda\n\n(use appropriate /dev/sdX name for the drive, where your GNU/Linux installation is located).\n\nA: You  must have an old, broken grub install on the IDE disk that is now being booted instead of the one on the original disk, which will still work fine if you tell your BIOS to boot from that drive instead of the IDE one.\nThe bios always assigns (hd0) to whichever drive it is trying to boot from since DOS/Windows can not boot from any other drive.\n\nA: I manage to solve the issue by changing boot flag on my partition it was pointing to wrong partition  /dev/sda6 this happened  after I remove Swap partition , and  my partition table order changed so my boot partition become /dev/sda5 I use fdisk to fix this I type command as followed :- \nfdisk /dev/sda\na\n5\nw\n\n\n\nA: I had the same issue and could not get it resolved using Grub-Rescue\nBooting off the Ubuntu live media (DVD or USB) and installing the boot-repair-tool resolved it for me\nHow to install the Boot-Repair tool in an Ubuntu live disc?\n", "Q: Problem While installing Ubuntu I was installing Ubuntu 12.10 from a Pen drive on Sony Vaio(Model is: SVE151D11L. 64 bit i3 processor) using an ISO image.

Ive got Ubuntu desktop up and running on my N54L microserver.

I can delete the ~ file at any time; it doesn't seem to make any difference to the actual file.

Any users in the 'sftponly' group are chrooted into their home directory upon connection. As OpenSSH requires the ChrootDirectory to be owned by root, each user has a sub-folder named 'upload' that they have permission to write to. This all works well, and users are restricted to their own area, whether they are aware of it or not.\nI would now like to provide access via HTTP/HTTPS for users to download files using just a web browser. I have been looking into Apache's mod_userdir, but this seems to be geared more towards anonymous access. I would like the system to require the user to authenticate before being able to download from their folder. It should also only allow them to download from their folder.\nFor example, a user would visit https://download.example.com/testuser/file.zip and be required to authenticate using the same credentials as they would when connecting via SFTP to download the file.\nI've been looking into solutions like creating a seperate virtual host for each user, and manually creating htaccess files in each home dir, but they seem kind of untidy.\nAny suggestions greatly appreciated.\n\nA: You need Apache to integrate with PAM for its authentication. This is fairly easily done through pwauth and mod_authnz_external. You can read more on the details here:\n\n\n*\n\n*http://icephoenix.us/linuxunix/apache-and-http-authentication-with-pam/\nThe problem is I can't see any way to hook that into the userdir module. pwauth will let you specify requires user <username> but I can't see how to combine the two. And trust me when I say I've searched.\nI think the easiest method for this would be to manually hold an entry for each and every user:\n<Directory /users/abed/>\n    DocumentRoot /home/abed/public_html/\n    AuthType Basic\n    AuthName \"Restricted Area\"\n    AuthBasicProvider external\n    AuthExternal pwauth\n    Require user abed\n</Directory>\n\n<Directory /users/britta/>\n    DocumentRoot /home/britta/public_html/\n    AuthType Basic\n    AuthName \"Restricted Area\"\n    AuthBasicProvider external\n    AuthExternal pwauth\n    Require user britta\n</Directory>\n\nAnd so on. You could even script something to regenerate this on a periodic basis.

If you\n  also install the package nautilus-actions, it can be integrated with\n  the Nautilus file manager to provide context-menu options.\n\nIt creates uncompressed backups in the place that you set in the options, allowing you to set useful elements like:\n\n\n*\n\n*Where to save your backups.\n\n*Schedule\n\n\n\n\n\n*Folders to be included.\n\n\n\n\n\n*Which folders or files you wish not to be included (by name or\npattern)\n\n\n\n\n\n*Choose the period of time after which a backup will be removed and\nhow many backups you wish to keep.\n\n\n\n\n\n*and Other useful options.\n\n\n\n\nOnce the backups are done, you can gain access to your data via the GUI of Back In Time or by diving inside of your backup folders (see the next screenshot).

I decided to dual boot Ubuntu.\nAfter install, it was booting straight into Ubuntu, with no GRUB menu showing up. No problem. I just ran boot repair and everything seemed to work fine. (Here's the output, btw: http://paste.ubuntu.com/5891478/)\nThen I booted into Windows. Now I can't seem to get back into Ubuntu. I tried disabling Fast Boot by running REG ADD \"HKLM\\SYSTEM\\CurrentControlSet\\Control\\Session Manager\\Power\" /V HiberbootEnabled /T REG_dWORD /D 0 /F in PowerShell as Administrator. Even now, GRUB is still being bypassed somehow.\nWhat should I do?\nEDIT: I tried reinstalling GRUB by booting a LiveUSB and following this: https://superuser.com/questions/376470/how-to-reinstall-grub2-efi. Unfortunately, that didn't work.\n\nA: The Boot Repair tool isn't 100% reliable. The problem you seem to have run into is that Boot Repair is rather over-enthusiastic about juggling boot loader files. Specifically, Boot Repair renames the Windows boot loader and installs a copy of GRUB in its place; however, this \"repair,\" in addition to being terribly confusing, is sometimes undone by Windows -- Windows sees the change and (quite reasonably) re-installs its own boot loader. What's more, this \"repair\" is seldom necessary; the tool just applies it in a scattershot approach with a bunch of other \"repairs\" in the hopes that it will be useful. Unfortunately, sometimes it's not, and it can cause follow-on problems.\nI recommend you try this:\n\n\n*\n\n*Back up the contents of your EFI System Partition (ESP; your /dev/sda1). This will serve as a fallback in case you make matters worse.\n\n*Re-run Boot Repair, but click the Advanced Options item and check the Restore EFI Backups option before proceeding.

Alternatively, use vncpasswd or\n-storepasswd pass file\nStore password pass as the VNC password in the file file. Once the password is stored the program exits. Use the password via \"-rfbauth file\". If called with no arguments, \"x11vnc -storepasswd\", the user is prompted for a password and it is stored in the file ~/.vnc/passwd. Called with one argument, that will be the file to store the prompted password in.\nStart x11vnc\n# Start x11vnc using ~/.vnc/passwd\nx11vnc -safer -forever -display :0 -rfbauth /home/terry/.vnc/passwd\n# less output to stderr -q -quiet\n# this does not eliminate all informational output, it only reduces it\nx11vnc -safer -forever -display :0 -rfbauth /home/terry/.vnc/passwd -q\n# eliminate all output\nx11vnc -safer -forever -display :0 -rfbauth /home/terry/.vnc/passwd 2>/dev/null 1>2&\n\nChange the VNC port to listen on\n-rfbport\n\nThe VNC port to listen on (a LibVNCServer option), e.g. 5900, 5901, etc. If specified as \"-rfbport PROMPT\" then the x11vnc -gui is used to prompt the user to enter the port number.\nx11vnc -rfbport 5901\n\nThis force x11vnc to use port 5901 (this is VNC display :1.)\nIf something else is using that port x11vnc will exit immediately. If you do not supply the -rfbport option, it will autoprobe starting at 5900 and work its way up to 5999 looking for a free port to listen on.\nSend x11vnc to background\nx11vnc -safer -forever -display :0 -rfbauth /home/terry/.vnc/passwd -bg\n\nGo into the background after screen setup. Messages to stderr are lost unless -o logfile is used.\nVNC password file\nThe option -rfbauth .vnc/passwd provides additional protection by requiring a VNC password for every VNC viewer that connects. The vncpasswd or storepasswd programs, or the x11vnc -storepasswd option can be used to create the password file. x11vnc also has the slightly less secure -passwdfile and -passwd XXXXX options to specify passwords.\n\nA: When launching the gnome-session and all else fails; as a fallback, use gnome-fallback! :)\n\"gnome-session --session=gnome-fallback &\"\nand you would at least get a desktop background to play with.\n\nA: gnome does not work right with vnc on ubuntu, even though I have never tried x11vnc, but I tried vnc4server with xfce4 session and it works\nto install xfce4 on Ubuntu\n# apt-get install gnome-core xfce4 firefox nano -y --force-yes\n\nedit your xstartup file to this\n# nano ~/.vnc/xstartup\n\nwith this content\n#!/bin/sh\nunset SESSION_MANAGER\nunset DBUS_SESSION_BUS_ADDRESS\nstartxfce4 &\n\n[ -x /etc/vnc/xstartup ] && exec /etc/vnc/xstartup\n[ -r $HOME/.Xresources ] && xrdb $HOME/.Xresources\nxsetroot -solid grey\nvncconfig -iconic &\n\n\nA: I also has this problem on Ubuntu v15 following this tutorial:\nwww.krizna.com/ubuntu/install-vnc-server-ubuntu-14-04\nThe vncviewer connected to vnc4server showing a blank desktop without shortcuts/launcher available.

Open your system in windows7.\n2. Know in which drive you installed Ubuntu\n3. Go to that drive and delete all the data related to Ubuntu including Ubuntu installation files completely (shift+delete).\n4. Then restart your system and now you would not have two OS' only Windows7 will be present.\n5. If you want to use that drive (where you had Ubuntu earlier) to some other purpose us can use it as it is or u can merge it with any other drive (except the drive where you have Windows7) using disk manager which is present in Control Panel > Administrative Tools > Hardware Management >  Disk Management.\n6.

If anyone has suggestions please do tell me!  Also as a side not, after switching from OS to OS quite a few times, I am not going back to the linux environment to fix the problem until I have a better understanding of what I am dealing with.  Thank you guys in advance for helping me out come up with a solution!  \nAfter trying out Ubuntu 12.04 LTS where it is installed as a program under windows 7, I decided to allocate some driver space for the OS to actually install it on my computer so that it can run on its own rather than under windows 7.  \nBefore I installed Ubuntu, I allocated space for the OS by shrinking the C: drive by 100 gb, which is where I am going to install Ubuntu.\nI installed Ubuntu with the \"Install along side windows 7 option\" selected with no problems.  But when I restarted my computer, it loaded windows 7 immediately with no boot menu displaying.  I restarted again and once more the menu did not show up.  So I figured that maybe I installed it incorrectly so I installed it again.\nWhen I installed Ubuntu, this time I selected the last option in the install options.  This led me to a window that shows all the /dev/sda options on where I am going to install Ubuntu.  Now the thing that confuses me is that the 100 gb space I allocated is called dev/sda5 ext 4.  There was a free space option but that was only 20 gb in size.  Since the 100gb /dev/sda5 ext 4 option seems the proper place to put Ubuntu, this is where I selected to install. \nAfter installation, I restart the computer and once again it boots up windows 7 immediately with no boot menu specifying which OS I can select.\nI checked under disk management in windows and the space that I allocated for Ubuntu under windows stills says that 100 gb unallocated.  Shouldn't it say something else?  Or is that normal or did I do something wrong?  \nAny advice would be much appreciated on how I can fix this problem!\nBelow I will post the results of running boot info script:\n     Boot Info Script

I was wondering if there is a way for me to construct my toobar such that i only have to build one toolbar (rather than a different toolbar for each tab) and have it show different buttons depending on which tab is active, and how i would go about doing that (if it is possible).  This is because there are some toolbar buttons that will be static between the tabs (ie//delete, send to archive, forward or such) and some that will change based on the active tab...and i would rather not write a different toolbar for each tab.\nie//\nsomething sort of like this:\nif currentTab = 0\n{ show static items and tab-dependent items }\n       else if currentTab = 1\n{ show static items and different tab-dependent items }\n...and so on for each tab.\nthanks in advance!\n\nA: You could use the parameter visible in ToolbarButton. For example:\nToolbarButton {\n    visible: {\n        if(currentTab == 0) return true\n        else return false\n    }\n    action: Action {\n        text: \"Whatever\"\n        iconSource: Qt.resolvedUrl(\"images/icon.png\")\n        onTriggered: { print(\"Hello world\") }\n    }\n}\n\nThis example will make it so this specific button is only visible when currentTab is equal to 0, in other words, the first tab.\n", "Q: Install a software using another distribution's branch Suppose software like https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/raring/+source/skipfish has more recent release in 13.04, how do I add to apt-get in 12.04 to make use of that branch?\nThanks\n\nA: The page you have listed is linking to source code, which you cannot install using apt-get.

After installing Ubuntu, I used the tool boot-repair to get my laptop to load grub upon startup. Unfortunately, after a while, I have noticed that I can no longer boot from a flash drive (to reinstall windows or another linux distro) because the boot menu is filled up with Ubuntu entries. The UEFI firmware is behaving oddly and I'm scared that I will end up with a brick unable to boot any OS.\nBoot-repair info\n\nAll options including \"OS Boot Manager\" take me to grub. The list does not scroll. From looking at the Windows 8 advanced reboot menus I know there are more options hidden down there. My settings indicate that secure boot is disabled. However, when I boot the flash drive from Windows 8's advanced reboot menu I get a message indicating that my computer will not boot from it (if you need the exact text I can try that again).\nI imagine fixing this involves removing those extra entries from some EFI boot partition or something. Thanks in advance for your help.\nMy laptop is a HP Envy Spectre XT.\n\nA: The extra Ubuntu entries probably aren't related to your problem, but I could be wrong. Certainly I've heard of weirder EFI problems. Thus, you might as well address it. To do so, first type sudo efibootmgr in Ubuntu. This should produce a list like this:\nBootCurrent: 0000\nTimeout: 0 seconds\nBootOrder: 0000,0002,0003,0001\nBoot0000* rEFInd Boot Manager\nBoot0001* fedora\nBoot0002* rEFInd (via PreLoader)\nBoot0003* ubuntu\n\nThese entries are from one of my systems, and of course yours will be different -- it will probably have a large number of ubuntu entries. Take note of the BootOrder list -- it identifies the order in which entries are tried. Chances are one of your ubuntu entries will be first on that list, or at least very early on it. You can delete all of the other ubuntu entries with efibootmgr, as in:\nsudo efibootmgr -b 0003 -B\n\nThat command deletes entry Boot0003 (which is the only ubuntu entry in my example).\nOnce that's done, try again to boot a USB flash drive. If you can't do it, try using the Boot From EFI File option shown in your screen shot; that may enable you to select a file on your USB flash drive.\nIt's also conceivable that there's a setting in your firmware that's disabling USB flash drive access. On one of my computers, for instance, there's an option to do a quick USB initialization that prepares USB keyboards but not USB storage devices. If that option is enabled, it becomes impossible to boot from a USB flash drive. Thus, such options must be set to do a full USB initialization at boot time. (Check your USB flash drive's access lights as you boot; if they don't flash, chances are the firmware is not initializing the device.)\nIf all this fails, it's conceivable that installing rEFInd will help; in theory, it should produce a list of bootable USB devices. This will only work if the USB devices are initialized, though.\n", "Q: Use Postfix to dump mails to local folder using regex How do I use postfix to filter certain emails (by domain or sender) and for those who fall under the rule (filter) save locally and those who doesn't to relay regularly ?\n\nA: The following recipe tells how to use regex to rewrite envelope recipients' addresses using regexp: https://superuser.com/questions/353488/regex-multiple-catch-all-setup-in-postfix\nYou may use the above method to rewrite remote email addresses into local email addresses.\nRegexp table man page shows how to copy parts of lookup key to lookup result:\n/^(.*)-outgoing@(.*)$/   550 Use ${1}@${2} instead\n\n", "Q: What is the difference between fglrx* and fglrx? Is there a difference between fglrx* and fglrx?\nWhat is the meaning of * if added??\nI did use the following steps because I was not sure whether I've had a graphic driver or not. So I wanted to activate a driver...\nATI/AMD proprietary FGLRX graphics install fails, how can I resolve the problem?\nThen many problems occured - like changes of the quality of the desktop environment - and I wanted to know if they happened because of the difference of *?\nI am a new Ubuntu 12.04 user. Was it wrong to have purged fglrx*? I also get this error each time I boot Ubuntu since then:\n\nThe disk drive for /dev/mapper/cryptswap1 is not ready yet or not present\n\nI would be really glad if someone could help me out!\n\nA: The * is a \"wildcard\" character, it basically means \"any number of characters\".\nFor example, let's say you have three packages/programs installed called fglrx and fgrlx-updates, and fglrx-amdcccle. If you only want to remove fglrx, you will use apt-get remove fglrx. If you want to remove all three of them, you'll have to do apt-get remove fglrx fglrx-updates fglrx-amdcccle. However, an easier way would be to do apt-get remove fglrx*, which means remove all packages that start with fglrx.\nIn the steps of the link you provided, the person mentioned sudo apt-get --purge remove fglrx*. This is to ensure that you remove all packages related to fglrx, so you can start all over and install only the needed packages. So to answer your question, yes, that command removed your ATI graphics drivers, and made Ubuntu use the open source drivers, that's why the quality of the desktop environment changed.\nI suggest you now run the command sudo apt-get --purge remove fglrx*, then sudo apt-get autoremove, then restart, then use the Additional Drivers to install, then reboot.\n\n\n", "Q: Unable to start PostgreSQL: Operation not Permitted I have a question about starting and using postgresql once it has been installed.\nHere is the command that I have used and the error message:\ndbacc@dbacc-Compaq-615:~$ /etc/init.d/postgresql start\n\nchmod: changing permissions of `/var/run/postgresql': Operation not permitted\n\nThe installation seemed to go well.

Can I save my images in some special folder to see them there? Is it possible to add a folder instead of just one image at the time, so they rotate?\n\nA: You can use Variety.\n\nVariety is a wallpaper changer for Ubuntu which is featureful, yet\n  slim and very easy to use. It can automatically download wallpapers\n  from various online sources, allows rotating them on a regular\n  interval or on demand, and provides easy to use ways to separate the\n  great images from the junk.\n\nTo install Variety, just press Ctrl+Alt+T on your keyboard to open Terminal.

On the same time server might have packages installed that would not be there if use Ubuntu on a desktop.\nBefore you start, it is always good to update packages list before you install something:\nsudo apt-get update\n\nThe easiest solution would be to use a program called Tasksel that you can install by typing:\nsudo apt-get install tasksel\n\nRun it by typing:\nsudo tasksel\n\nIt gives you a simple gui to manage larger software bundles (\"LAMP server\", \"Ubuntu desktop\", \"Lubuntu desktop\") that have been installed in your system. Mark the stuff you need with asterisks by selecting them with up/down arrows and pressing space. After that press enter install what you have selected.

I want to upgrade my OS from 12.04LTS to 13.04,but the update manager only shows me 12.10 as an upgrade option available.\nWhat do i do now?? Please suggest me a safe and legal way.\n\nA: You can go from 12.04 to 13.04 directly, but a flawless system would not be guaranteed, you might have issues of the device dropping WiFi signals and similar stuff. It'll be better if you update to 12.10 and from there to 13.04\nThe reason behind this is that the packaging scripts that come with every release have a great deal of conversion to do, converting old settings and formats into new and current formats. If you jump from a release to another, this'll become quite difficult for the script to manage. \nThat's why, by convention you can upgrade from one LTS version to another, in this case from 12.04 to 14.04, or from one release to the next release, i.e. 12.04->12.10->13.04.\nHope this helped.\n\nA: First, you must upgrade to 12.10.

My Seagate  500 GB external HDD stopped working few days ago for unknown reasons. I don't really care about the data on it anymore.

I get this error when I connect it via USB:\nError mounting /dev/sdb1 at /media/sourabh/Backup: Command-line `mount -t \"ntfs\" -o \"uhelper=udisks2,nodev,nosuid,uid=1000,gid=1000,dmask=0077,fmask=0177\" \"/dev/sdb1\" \"/media/sourabh/Backup\"' exited with non-zero exit status 13: The disk contains an unclean file system (0, 0).\nThe file system wasn't safely closed on Windows.

In the first case run chkdsk /f on Windows then reboot into Windows twice. The usage of the /f parameter is very important! If the device is a SoftRAID/FakeRAID then first activate it and mount a different device under the /dev/mapper/ directory, (e.g. /dev/mapper/nvidia_eahaabcc1). Please see the 'dmraid' documentation for more details.\nFailed to sync device /dev/sdb1: Input/output error\nFailed to close volume /dev/sdb1: Input/output error\n\nHow can I force format this drive?\n\nA: GParted or KDE Partition Manager require an unmounted drive to operate.  Given your system is detecting the drive, but refusing to mount it, you should be able to select Device, New Partition Table after selecting the correct device in either partition manager and clear everything up in about one minute, plus the time it takes to create the new filesystem.\n\nA: force the format on windows via Disc manager, or however they call it now in your windoze version. This should work as well.\nIf you prefer The Linux way, then you can list your drives by \nfdisk -l | grep '^Disk'\n\nchoose which you want to re-partition and create partitions by \nfdisk /dev/sdx\n\nwhere you replace x for letter of your drive. Use \"m\" for list the fdisk help and then follow the white rabbit. Do not make a mistake in choosing your drive, you can easily kill any other drive and data.\n\nA: This problem has nothing to do with Ubuntu. Your file system is corrupted as it is not properly closed in Windows. Please try the following steps in Windows (probably Win7)\n\n\n*\n\n*Check whether the disk is shown in Disk Management. To do that, goto \nStart -> Run -> and type \"diskmgmt.msc\". \n\n*In the Disk Management Window, if you see the removable disk (your seagate) with unallocated space, then follow the steps below.\n\n\n*\n\n*Right click on it and select \"New Simple Volume\", go through the wizard and create new partition.\n\n*If your drive is partitioned and you still can’t see it, ensure you’ve set a drive letter so you can access it in Windows. This should happen automatically, but if you’ve manually unset the drive letter, the drive may not show up and be accessible in Windows. \n\n*To do this, right-click the removable drive partition, select Change Drive Letter and Paths, and add a drive letter. For example, add the letter G: and the removable drive will be accessible at drive G: (any of your wish).\n\n*If the drive does appear to be partitioned, it may be partitioned with the wrong file system. May be with the ext4 file system from Linux. Windows can’t read these file systems. Reformat the drive with the newer NTFS file system or older FAT32 file system so Windows will be able to recognize it.\n\n*To reformat a partition, right-click it, select Format, and select your desired file system.\n\n*Note that this will erase all the files on your drive, so you’ll want to copy any important files off of it first.\n\n\n*If you don’t see the drive in the Disk Management, then continue the following steps where we will try to determine why your drive isn’t recognized.\n\n\n*\n\n*If Windows doesn’t see your drive at all, possibilities are there is a hardware issue with your computer USB port, a driver problem with your Windows computer, or you may just have a dead drive (mostly).\n\n*First, unplug the drive from your USB port and try plugging it into another USB port on your computer. If it works in one USB port but not another, you may have a dead USB port. If you’ve plugged the drive into a USB hub, try connecting it to the computer instead. Some USB hubs won’t provide enough power for your external drive to function\n\n*If the drive doesn’t show up in Disk Management even after you skip the USB hub and connect it to another USB port on your computer, it’s tough to know for certain whether the drive itself is bad or the computer is having a problem.\n\n*If you have another computer nearby, try plugging the drive in there to check whether it’s detected. If the drive doesn’t work on any computer you plug it into — be sure to check whether it appears in the computer’s Disk Management window — the drive itself is likely dead and will need to be replaced.\n\n*If the drive does work on other computers — or you don’t have another computer around to test this with — Windows may be having a driver problem with the drive. You can check the Device Manager.\n\n*To open it, press Windows Key + R, type “devmgmt.msc” into the Run dialog, and press Enter.\n\n*Look under Disk drives and check for any devices with a yellow exclamation mark next to them. If you see a yellow exclamation mark, you have a driver problem. Right-click the device with a yellow exclamation mark, select Properties, and look at the error message. This error message can help you fix the problem — you may want to perform a Google search for the error message you find\n\n*Such problems can be tricky to fix. If the problem started recently, you may want to run System Restore. You may want to use the Update Driver button to install an updated driver, use the Roll Back Driver button to revert any changes, or use the Uninstall button to uninstall the device from your system and hope that Windows will reinstall the driver and configure it correctly when you reconnect the drive.\nBy the above steps, you may come to a conclusion of your Seagate drive.\n", "Q: Upgrade and new software installation fails Errors were encountered while processing:\n linux-image-extra-3.8.0-19-generic\nE: Sub-process /usr/bin/dpkg returned an error code (1)\nThe output of uname -a is:\n\nLinux balu-System-Product-Name 3.8.0-23-generic #34-Ubuntu SMP Wed May 29 20:24:54 UTC 2013 i686 athlon i686 GNU/Linux\n\n\nA: You have a package that was not installed correctly or is broken.

However, since updating last week Ubuntu has overwritten my ability to boot from a CD and I can't figure out a way to get rid of it.\n\nA: When you first turn on your PC, the Hard Disk spins up as the Computer finds out that it is something other than a lump of metal and plastic, the information for this is stored in the BIOS, there is usually a screen which flashes up for a couple of seconds or so. The following instructions only work if they are carried out whilst this screen is showing.\nDepending on your PC and how much you have played with it in the past, depends whether you will receive a message on boot at the bottom of the screen or not, however, if no message is shown, press the following keys, one at a time F2, F12 and Del, it is usually one of these keys to access the BIOS Screen.\nOnce in the BIOS, use the arrow keys to navigate. Press the > key until you get to the Boot tab. Next use the V key to highlight the CD/DVD player, then make sure that it appears above the other disks by pressing (usually) + key.\nOnce the CD/DVD player is at the top of the list, Click on the >, highlight the Save and Exit option and hit Enter. This will save the new configuration and reboot the system. If your Windows CD is in the CD drive, it will (should) boot that rather than Ubuntu.\n\nA: When you turn on your computer it will load up a screen at the bottom it will say something like Press Del to open BIOS, When you open the BIOS depending on what type of motherboard you have you can change your boot order. The most useful order is probably. \nFirst boot: CD\nSecond Boot: HDD\nThird Boot:Anything you want. (In case for some reason the HDD is not there this will take effect.)\n", "Q: Restoring the default KDE Desktop? Sorry, I am still a newbie on Linux, I was installing earlier some new DEs, I made fresh installation of Ubuntu 13.04, installed, then added KUBUNUTU-DESKTOP, LUBUNTU-DESKTOP and GNOME...\nthen when I wanted to test my new KDE things were kinda, weird instead of the normal KDE 4.10.5 desktop I mean the place with the wallpaper, short-cuts and widgets are,\nI got this weird looking thing, that is like a blue outdated ugly version of the old gnome 3 dash....\nI want back my default desktop....\nany ideas? Dx\nScreenshots attached below:\nWHAT I GOT:\n\nWHAT I WANT (BACK):\n\n\nA: it looks to me like a few gnome desktop elements made its way through kde.\nfirst off, you should follow the link for the \"possible duplicate of...\" above, as the old config might fix kde\notherwise, if you don't need gnome anymore, you could try removing it from dah package manager or with sudo apt-get remove gnome..\nyou also may want to check your auto-starting apps and make sure they are the kde varients, sometimes when you use gnome and lxde based apps, they start to leak their desktop elements with it :O\n\nA: I am not sure about this, but KDE's configuration is stored in a hidden folder at your home called ~/.kde. Under normal conditions (I mean, with one DE) you can delete this folder so it gets recreated with default settings next time you log in.\nIt occurs to me that maybe you could try either deleting that folder to restore default configuration or try to find if GNOME as a similar folder which can be deleted so it does not interfere with KDE.\nIf you have one partition for / and a different one for /home , another option could be to install a default Kubuntu and format / partition but keep the /home one so you would not lose any custom configuration or data (images, videos, documents, files...) and you would only have to install any custom software or driver.\n", "Q: Flash can not be displayed normally on Ubuntu 13.04 I have upgraded to Ubuntu 13.04 and installed Adobe Flash.

Simply click on Cinnamon, then log in as usuall.\nThe next time you either logoff, or reboot the computer, LightDM will remember which environment you used (Cinnamon) and will reuses it unless you specify otherwise.\nHowever, the button will loose the Ubuntu logo, and show only a white background, so if youcant remember where it is, perhaps you should consider using a different logon screen, such as MDM. If you choose to follow the installation instructions in that link, you'll eventually be asked to choose your default logon manager.\n", "Q: Package system broken / unable to install updates due to incorrect (?) disk full message Here's a copy of part of the output I'm seeing when I try to update;\ndpkg: error processing /var/cache/apt/archives/linux-headers-3.2.0-49_3.2.0-49.75_all.deb (--unpack):\n error creating directory `./usr/src/linux-headers-3.2.0-49/arch/m68k/platform/68EZ328': No space left on device\nNo apport report written because the error message indicates a disk full error\n                                                                              dpkg-deb: error: subprocess paste was killed by signal (Broken pipe)\nErrors were encountered while processing:\n /var/cache/apt/archives/linux-headers-3.2.0-49_3.2.0-49.75_all.deb\nE: Sub-process /usr/bin/dpkg returned an error code (1)\n\n\ncolin@colin-Satellite-A60:~$ df -h\nFilesystem      Size  Used Avail Use% Mounted on\n/dev/sda6        11G  8.5G  1.6G  85% /\nudev            336M  4.0K  336M   1% /dev\ntmpfs           138M  768K  137M   1% /run\nnone            5.0M     0  5.0M   0% /run/lock\nnone            343M   88K  343M   1% /run/shm\n\nI've tried the usual sudo apt-get install -f as well as sudo apt-get clean without success - I know I've got a lot of old Linux kernels installed which I can't remove because of the disk space full error, so I'm running out ideas, can anyone advise please ?\nNote this is xubuntu running on an ancient Toshiba A60 laptop as a WUBI install IIRC :-}\n\nA: I found a workable solution in reply to someone having the same problem in another thread;\n Of the two answers, the first worked for me (I'm not really sure what to do with the second answer to be honest !\n\nA: Because it's a Wubi install, the Windows filesystem might have ran out of space.\n", "Q: Ceph Openstack HA installation with maas and juju but partially on physical servers and few on virtual machines I am planning to deploy OpenStackHA which 28 servers, which is quit a lot for me.

I think I've messed up something with my partition mount points.\n\nOK, this is the thing. When I have been fresh installing Ubuntu 12.10 from a Live CD, I made all my partitions with ext4 file system format and mounted them at random mount points (now special interest on /DOS and /Windows, see it here). After installation complete, I wasn't happy without seeing my partitions appear as shown in a picture at the red \"A\". As I had them there on my previous older laptop, witch was dual boot alongside with WimXP, and these partitions were NTFS. So I decided to format them back to NTFS. I've labeled these HDD1 and And HDD2. And somehow it become mounted an the directory /mnt/33E6E20A00342E2D and /mt/486FFA615D0979A2 seen in this picture at \"B\" and \"C\" marks. Despites all that, in general it worked all fine. Until I boot the machine next time, I encountered with the problem explaned here: \"How to avoid \"S to skip\" message on boot?\". I did try all the mentioned solutions and none worked in my case. As in my case there in no longer any partition as /DOS and /Windows.\nNow from here: \"Specifying a custom mount point for an empty partition\", I found that it may be the better way of having my partitions in a place \"A\" in this picture. I am willing to reformat these partitions back again to ext4, and mount them in a folder as /example/HDD1 and /example/HDD2 so I easy and quick access when needed. But I get now very confused what to do next. \nShould I use Disks or GParted? And what should I do with my \"S to skip\"? I can't just delete these directories.\n\nBonus:\n! Picture with \"A,B,C\"\n!

You have the entries (/dos and /windows) in fstab and that is why it is trying to mount those entries on reboot.\nCheck fstab and make sure you specify the same format in the fstab entry as partition is formatted. If not running Windows better to use ext4, but to use partition you will also need to set ownership & permissions to easily use partition as a data partition.\nAnytime you edit fstab, run this command to make sure all entries are valid.

Then, I made a partition so now I have 2 primary and 3 logical partitions (all NTFS). I want to install Ubuntu 12.10 so I used ube and Ubuntu 12.10 live. But problem is whenever I try to install Ubuntu from pen drive, it shows that there are no partitions so it wants to partition the whole hard disk. \nI searched on web but didn't find suitable a solution. My question is how can I install Ubuntu in this case?\n\nA: This symptom is most often caused by one of two problems:\n\n\n*\n\n*Leftover RAID data -- If the disk was used in a RAID setup (which is sometimes the case even on single-disk setups, depending on your firmware settings), it may contain RAID data that will confuse libparted, the partitioning library used by the Ubuntu installer. Typing sudo dmraid -E -r /dev/sda will usually correct this problem. Do this only if you're positive that you're not actively using RAID on the disk, though; if Windows is using the RAID setup, this command will cause serious problems!\n\n*Damaged partition table -- Even minor damage to a partition table caused libparted to flake out. Most such problems can be fixed by my FixParts program. The Web page describes details of its use. On occasion, problems will need to be corrected in some other way, but more information (like the fdisk output that Mitch has requested) is necessary to diagnose the problem.\n\n", "Q: Resetting network settings in Ubuntu 13.04 In my Ubuntu 13.04 I was messing around with the network connections without creating backups.

To connect, I opened another account in Ubuntu and I can connect easily through that account. I used these commands in my older account as far as I recall:\nairodump-ng wlan0\nairodump-ng eth0\n\nIs there any way to reset the network configuration to the initial installation state?\n\nA: I struggled with a similar problem, and I stumbled on this. It solved my problem pretty fast.\nI first went to /etc/NetworkManager/ where I found the file NetworkManager.conf, then disabled Network Manager with this command:\nsudo service network-manager stop\n\nThen I opened NetworkManager.conf with the nano text editor:\nsudo nano NetworkManager.conf\n\nand changed ifupdown managed=false to ifupdown managed=true\nthen restarted the Network manager using this:\nsudo service network-manager start\n\nAnd that's it!\n", "Q: Upgrading from ubuntu 12.04 to 13.10 How do I upgrade from Ubuntu 12.04 to Ubuntu 13.10. I have tried the one I this link\nI gives option to upgrade to 12.10 not 13.10\nI want to directly upgrade to 13.10 from 12.04 \n\nA: It'll be better if you don't move from 12.04 to 13.10 directly. The package scripts are responsible for conversion and creation of new settings which will be messed up if you jump releases like that. You may end up with a buggy system that'll ruin your experience with the new release. It'll be better if you upgrade to 12.10 and then to 13.04. The releases are made that way so you can go from one version to another or from one LTS version to another LTS version. \nWhen you've got 13.04, you can further upgrade to 13.10, but I'd really not recommend that. It is still under development, and is not suggested for regular use.\nIf you do wish to use 13.10, my suggestion would be to download the .iso of the file from here, and boot it from a LiveUSB or on a virtual machine on Ubuntu itself. VirtualBox is a great tool for this, and you can run 13.10 without the risk of your system crashing and consequent data loss.\n", "Q: Reducing amount of primary partitions Hello I'm trying to create room to install windows on a pre-installed Ubuntu 12.04 laptop. I'm using Gparted and currently my partitions look like this \n\nObviously I'm over 4 primary partitions and I'd like to know what/if I can move/change into extended partitions so I can free up room to convert my unallocated into a new primary partition.\nI know I can delete the first one as that's my recovery partition from dell, but when I tried to create a recovery USB and CD I've been greeted with an error message so I'm worried if all goes wrong I won't get my factory settings back again.\n\nA: I recommend the following:\n\n\n*\n\n*Back up all your important user data. The following steps pose a small risk of data loss.\n\n*In GParted, expand the extended partition to cover the available free space.\n\n*Shrink /dev/sda2 by a tiny amount (1MiB should be sufficient).\n\n*Move /dev/sda5 to the start of the freshly-expanded extended partition.\n\n*Type sudo fdisk -l /dev/sda and check the type codes (under the Id column) of all your partitions.\n\n*Run my FixParts program and use it to convert /dev/sda3 to logical form. If necessary, adjust the type codes of your partitions to match what fdisk showed. /dev/sda1 and /dev/sda2 will probably have to be changed from 0x07 to 0x0c.\n\n*Re-launch GParted and, if necessary, shrink the extended partition so that the free space at the end of the disk lies outside of the extended partition.\n\n*Create a new primary partition for Windows at the end of the disk.\n\n\nAlternatively, if the laptop is new enough (less than about 2 years old, give or take a bit), it probably has an EFI/UEFI firmware. If so, you could use gdisk to convert the disk from MBR to GPT format, install an EFI boot loader for Linux, and install Windows in EFI mode. This has the advantage that GPT supports up to 128 partitions by default, with no distinction between primary, extended, and logical partitions, so the partitioning task becomes easier; but EFI-mode booting is newer and still has glitches on some systems, so there's a greater risk of problems.\nUnfortunately, it's impossible to know which approach is better without trying them both on your specific hardware. (Assuming of course that your firmware is EFI-based; if it's an older BIOS-only firmware, the second option isn't really available to you.)\n", "Q: Ubuntu 12.04 installation on Sony Vaio VGN-UX390N - monitor blank on right, vertical lines on left I recently installed 12.04 onto this little Sony, taking everything but the small recovery partition for its original Vista OS, and everything went well. \nYesterday, I noticed when I turned it on, the screen was blank on the right, with vertical lines on the left - the colors of the vertical lines match the logon screen, during boot-up, but then the logon screen appeared, I entered my password, and everything worked well. \nI installed Dropbox, synced it with my other 12.04 machine, then installed dropbox, and synced it. At this point, the battery was starting to get low, so I placed the sony onto it's docking port, where the power cord was plugged in, and the screen went blank on the left, with vertical lines on the right. \nAs I couldn't get the machine to do anything, and was therefore unable to shutdown properly, so I removed it from the docking platform, to let the battery run down, as I have it set to shut down due to low battery. \nThis morning, I energized the machine, and found the same issue. \n\n\n*\n\n*I have tried starting on the battery, with the plugged in docking port, with the power cord plugged directly into the computer, and each of the previous methods with the battery removed, to no avail. \n\n*I have tried to get into the bios with the FN + F1, F2, F3 and F4 with no joy. \n\n*I tried powering on while pressing ESC - no joy. \n\n*I read something to do with video speed/stamina switch, which sounded like a physical switch, but have been unable to find anything specific to this computer. \n\n\nI am hoping that some of you who are smarter than me, may have the answer.

Picture below Ok so I've spent all day trying to figure out the problem and still can't figure out what's up..

Well that didn't work so I compared my screen to the one in the tutorial and it's totally different. My list of \"code\" or whatever is about 3 lines long..

I have an external drive on which I backed up data from another external drive using my Ubuntu 12.10 system. Now it would seem that there is a problem with folder and file permissions on the drive as I cannot access the files from another system (namely, my iPad through a Verbatim MediaShare Wireless device and the app for it).\nSome folders do not show their contents at all (but the files are there thankfully, as they show up when I plug the drive to my Ubuntu system), other files cannot be opened.\nThis only happened after backed up the date on the external drive. The same data on the other external drive on which it was backed up was accessible with no problem at all. My logical conclusion, and I have to stress that my knowledge is limited here, is that the problem is with the ownership and permission settings.\nI would like to make my external drive and the data on it, accessible to all (those that plug it in) so that I can access it on my iPad. Actually, I am also open to the idea of having the drive accessible to all with some folders accessible to all with read / write permissions and with others with only read permissions or with no accessibility at all. That is what would like to do and I am also open to your suggestions on security issues (i.e. making the setup more secure, as long as I can have access and read/write permissions on the drive while connected to my iPad). I am assuming that to do what I want I require accessibility available to all as well as read permissions, in the least.\n\nA: First, using chmod -R 777, which I see mentioned on every similar question, would make every document inside the main folder executable, and I doubt you need (or want) that. What you need is to change permissions for everyone else to have read-write access to the storage drive. That can also be achieved through chmod.\nFor example, the following file has read-write permission for the owner only and read-only access for the group, meaning I can't read or edit:\n-rw-r-----  1 nobody users      4 Jul 24 20:26 file\n\nThere are four digits for chmod which can be combined to achieve a different result:\n4 - read\n2 - write\n1 - execute\n0 - nothing\nAnd there are three digits that change file permissions for different things:\nfirst digit - owner\nsecond digit - group\nthird digit - everyone else\nTo make a file in question readable by anyone, while still retaining the original permission for the owner and group, I can execute this:\nsudo chmod 646 file\n\nThat makes file read-write for owner (2+4), read-only for group (4) and read-write for anyone else (2+4). Now I can view and edit it, and ls -l now says the following:\n-rw-r--rw-  1 nobody users      4 Jul 24 20:26 file\n\nIn case of applying that to the entire storage drive, you'd have to mount it, like so:\nsudo mount /dev/sdX /path/to/mountpoint\n\nReplace /dev/sdX with your external storage drive and /path/to/mountpoint with where you want the drive to be mounted (I usually make a directory in /mnt for that). You can also check which storage drive is the external one with:\nsudo fdisk -l\n\nSo you don't chmod the wrong one. And then run\nsudo chmod -R 646 /path/to/mountpoint\n\nwhich will recursively change permissions for each and every file and folder on the mounted storage drive, allowing read/write access to the owner, read-only access to the group and read/write access to everyone else.\nPut simply, chmod -R 646 will make all folders and files on the storage drive accessible, readable and editable by anyone on any PC and/or OS, while keeping default permissions for the file owner and group.\n\nA: The easy way is to:\n\n\n*\n\n*launch nautilus from terminal with sudo nautilus\n\n*navigate to the root folder on the drive you want accessible by all\n\n*Right click on the folder and select Properties from the bottom of the drop down list.\n\n*In the window that opens, click on the permissions tab and then make sure that all the settings are as follows replacing simon with your group name\n\n", "Q: Why is 'auto eth0' a problem to Kernel > 3.2? With this new question I refer to this previous question :\nis there \"force\" to be online?\nWhy is 'auto eth0' in file /etc/network/interfaces a problem to the Kernels > 3.2 ?\nWhen entry 'auto eth0' is given, and machine is unplugged to the network-cable, then machine cannot boot further than \"configuring network\" and hangs itselfs up.\nWhen I delete 'auto eth0' then machine can boot normal without being plugged to the network-cable.\nThis was not the case with Kernel 3.2.x\n( But when I want to be back to internet - have to add back 'auto eth0' again .)\n\nA: If you declare 'auto eth0' in /etc/network/interfaces, you are telling the system to connect the ethernet automatically. But then, as you said, you have disconnected the ethernet cable. You have given the system an impossible task: to connect the ethernet but without a cable connection to the router! The system will try to follow your instructions for several minutes and will eventually boot without the connection you requested.\nUsually, Network Manager will handle all this for you with no entries in /etc/network/interfaces except for loopback. If that is not happening, you will have better luck troubleshooting NM rather than giving the system an unresolvable problem.\n", "Q: Skype installation warning about harm to computer I wanted to install Skype for my Ubuntu studio. But there was a warning that this Type of File could harm my Computer.\nWhat should I do?\n\nA: Usually, if there is not a really good reason, one should only install software from the official Ubuntu repositories. \nThat said, skype is one of the cases, that this rule has to be broken, because it is not in the official *verse repos. But you are lucky, because Skype is one of the few proprietary applications, that are available in the official Partner repository. To enable it, open software sources and check the partner repo on the third party sources tab. Then reload package information (for instance by running 'sudo apt-get update'  in a terminal), and Skype should be available in software center (or any other package manager frontend like synaptic or aptitude). \n\nA: such type of warning you will get ususally when ever you are trying to install some software/application from a third party repo's. Skype is not from official Ubuntu repo and its a 3rd party repo from the view of Ubuntu. \nWhat ever the harm thats gonna happen due to 3rd party repo, Ubuntu will not be responsible.\nyou know the secret is , In the Ubuntu usage from 5 years I have never faced any problem with 3rd party repos.\nyou are free to go.\n", "Q: In which repository is Libreoffice to be found? I can't seem to find libreoffice in the repositories. I would please like to know where to find a copy of this office suite.\n\nA: You can normally find LibreOffice on the Ubuntu Software Center (an application that is normally installed on your computer).\nJust type LibreOffice on the text field on the top left of this application and it should show you LibreOffice.\nActually it should be preinstalled with Ubuntu so you should find it in your application (Super (Windows key) + A to access your applications).\n\nA: Since LibreOffice is an office suite, it provides multiple applications, and also supports the addition of features provided by even more packages.\nMost components of LibreOffice are in the Main repository. However, a few of them are in the Universe repository (which is still official, but is maintained by the community, rather than by Canonical).\nThe package called libreoffice provides a full installation (by depending on all the packages that, taken together, comprise a full installation). Since the most fully featured installation of LibreOffice contains some components provided by Universe, the libreoffice package must be in Universe too, even though most of what gets installed is in Main.\nIf you don't want to enable the Universe repository, you can just install the individual LibreOffice applications you need. These are provided by packages named libreoffice- followed by the lower-case name of the package:\n\n\n*\n\n*libreoffice-writer (Writer, the word processor)\n\n*libreoffice-calc (Calc, the spreadsheet)\n\n*libreoffice-impress (Impress, the presentation creation app comparable to MS PowerPoint)\n\n*libreoffice-base (Base, the database)\n\n*libreoffice-draw (Draw, the vector graphics editor)\n\n*libreoffice-math (Math, the equation editor)\n\n\nOr, you can enable the Universe repository and just install the package called libreoffice.\nNote that if you just install the individual components but keep Universe disabled, you won't get packages like fonts-sil-gentium-basic. (Actually, in Ubuntu 13.04, that appears to possibly be the only package you won't get.) A list of all the packages that libreoffice causes to be installed is here; if you click on a package you can see if it's in Universe or Main.\n", "Q: Ubuntu Touch connecting to 3G The connection was not supported by oFono I am trying to enable 3g on ubuntu touch.

I removed notify-osd but then another notification started appearing instead when changing the volume:\n\nIs there a way to remove this notification as well? I use my Logitech G110 keyboard's volume controller to adjust the volume. \n\nA: The volume notification from your screenshot is generated by the media-keys plugin to gnome-settings-daemon. Unfortunately, after browsing through the code for a bit, it doesn't appear that there is a way to disable the OSD without breaking the functionality for the keys (without of course editing the code and recompiling, which is of course a viable option).\nHowever, I did notice that it is suppressed when the Ubuntu notifications are enabled. That doesn't immediately help us of course, because you wanted to and have removed notify-osd. But I came up with a sort of silly solution. Instead, we create our own simple notification daemon which says it supports the volume messages, and then silently eats all notifications. The code:\nfrom __future__ import print_function\n\nimport dbus\nimport dbus.service\nimport dbus.mainloop.glib\n\nfrom gi.repository import GObject\n\nSERVICE_NAME = \"org.freedesktop.Notifications\"\nSERVICE_PATH = \"/org/freedesktop/Notifications\"\n\nclass Notifications(dbus.service.Object):\n  @dbus.service.method(SERVICE_NAME,\n      in_signature=\"susssasa{sv}i\", out_signature=\"u\")\n  def Notify(self, app_name, id, icon, summary, body, actions, hints, timeout):\n    print(app_name, summary, body)\n    return 1\n\n  @dbus.service.method(SERVICE_NAME,\n      in_signature=\"u\", out_signature=\"\")\n  def CloseNotification(self, id): \n    pass\n\n  @dbus.service.method(SERVICE_NAME,\n      in_signature=\"\", out_signature=\"as\")\n  def GetCapabilities(self):\n    return [\"x-canonical-private-synchronous\"]\n\n  @dbus.service.method(SERVICE_NAME,\n      in_signature=\"\", out_signature=\"ssss\")\n  def GetServerInformation(self):\n    return (\"empty\", \"empty\", \"empty\", \"empty\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n  dbus.mainloop.glib.DBusGMainLoop(set_as_default=True)\n\n  session_bus = dbus.SessionBus()\n  name = dbus.service.BusName(SERVICE_NAME)\n  path = Notifications(session_bus, SERVICE_PATH)\n\n  mainloop = GObject.MainLoop()\n  mainloop.run()\n\nYou can of course comment out the print function in the Notify method, I just thought it would be nice to include some output so you could see it is working. GetCapabilities is where the magic happens, gnome-settings-daemon thinks we support it so it doesn't use its own OSD.\n", "Q: QtQuick not found (Lubuntu) On a fresh Lubuntu 13.04 installation, I installed Qt5 from the official ubuntu repositories.

Ubuntu 12.04 in Live CD mode does not recognize the presence of Windows 7 or any partition for that matter: it shows a completely blank HD. Windows 7 Professional was installed this morning along with a partition set aside for Ubuntu. \nI tried boot repair, here is the log:\nhttp://paste.ubuntu.com/5895278\nAnd there was no new result. \nI have a feeling it is the Advanced format of my HD that is causing the problem. Does anyone see a solution?\n\nA: The problem has nothing to do with your Advanced Format hard disk. The problem is identified by the following line in your Boot Repair log:\nGUID Partition Table detected, but does not seem to be used.\n\nThis indicates that the disk used to be a GPT disk, and was incompletely converted to MBR format, presumably by the Windows installer. The easiest immediate solution to this problem is to finish the job. My FixParts program is the easiest way to do this. Run it on the disk and it will complain about the leftover GPT data. Tell it to go ahead with deleting the data and then quit from the program.\nNote that your Windows is installed in BIOS mode, so you should be sure to install Ubuntu in the same way. Your installation program might launch in either BIOS mode or in EFI mode. I'm not sure how it will respond if you accidentally boot it in EFI mode. To avoid any possibility of problems, I recommend dropping to a text-mode shell and looking for a directory called /sys/firmware/efi. If it's present, you've booted in EFI mode, which means you should reboot and select a different boot option to get the computer to boot in BIOS mode instead.\n", "Q: How to let MySQL (mysqld) to create and write to \"/var/run/mysqld\" directory? I really don't understand how all those privileges work in Linuxes. \nTo start MySQL server mysqld program has to write its .pid files to /var/run/mysqld/ directory. But we know from FHS (Filesystem Hierarchy Standard) that:\n\nFiles under this directory must be cleared (removed or truncated as appropriate) at the beginning of the boot process. \n\nSo mysqld has to create /mysqld directory under /var/run/ every time MySQL server is started.\nThe owner and group of /var is root and /var is: \ndrwxr-xr-x  13 root root  4096 may 20 23:41 var.\n\nAnd we also know from FHS (Filesystem Hierarchy Standard) that:\n\n/var/run should be unwritable for unprivileged users (root or users running daemons); it is a major security problem if any user can write in this directory.\n\nSo mysqld cannot write to the directory.

This is a clear contradiction, isn't it?\nMy question is: how to let mysqld to create and write its files to /var/run/mysqld/ without changing permissions of the /var/run directory? For now I see the only way:\nuser@user-desktop:$ sudo chmod a+w /var\n\nBut it is forbidden by the Standard.\n\nA: /var/run should be unwritable for unprivileged users means that root and sudo accounts (as these are privileged users) are allowed to write to it.\nThe upstart script for MySQL is started as root and then is allowed to create a file or directory in /var/run. And this file is created with the permission as set in the configuration. This should be /etc/my.cnf and it will have something like this:\n[mysqld]\nuser   = mysql\nsocket = /var/lib/mysql/mysql.sock\n\n\nYou should have something related to mysql in /etc/init.d After I installed MySQL Server I get this:\n\nAre you sure you did not install the MySQL Client? \n\nA: (Server version: 5.7.28-0ubuntu0.18.04.4 (Ubuntu) in WSL2)\nApparmor holds system binaries controlling permissions for other files.

I'm just curious on what will happen if the memory fills up and would it notify me in some way if it did?\n\nA: In case your machine runs out of memory for the processes, the kernel's Out-of-Memory-killer (also known as OOM killer) kicks in.\nIt will hard-kill processes based on a certain algorithm, by providing scores. Your syslog/dmesg will then list entries like:\n[11686.043641] Out of memory: Kill process 2603 (flasherav) score 761 or sacrifice child\n[11686.043647] Killed process 2603 (flasherav) total-vm:1498536kB, anon-rss:721784kB, file-rss:4228kB\n\nWhile the processes are killed, you'll have to install monitoring on the server to get notified, such as logcheck .\nFor services (daemons) you can tell Upstart you respawn the process for you.

Migrating arrays can be tricky, don't risk loosing your data in the process.\nI would stress out that the only guaranteed way is to back up and verify all your data before trying anything like this, just in case.  I would personally use Clonezilla to make an image, then convert your RAID, and do a restore afterwards. \nNow depending on your RAID controller, if it supports \"online capacity extension\" it might be possible, but I have not tried it.  As I said, I'd rather be safe, and do a full backup, then you can delete the old RAID array, and create a new one that is configured the way you want. \nAnother thing you can try, instead of converting to RAID 10, Why not a 4 disk RAID 5? Your read performance will be better.  Plus then your array will end up with a total of 6TB total storage, but the RAID 10 will only be 4TB.

Then I installed Ubuntu and when I restarted the system it said:\nGRUB loading.. \nWelcome to GRUB!\nerror: disk 'lvm/fedora-boot' not found.\nEntering rescue mode...\ngrub rescue>\n\n\nA: Executive Summary\nThis problem (very probably) has the same solution as this question; if you wish, you can immediately skip to the solutions there (take your pick).1\nThis should enable you to boot to both your Ubuntu and Windows systems successfuly.\n1 However, since this is a very different form of the problem--the problem isn't the absence of GRUB in the MBR per se, but instead the presence of the old system's GRUB--I think this should be kept as a separate question, and not marked as a duplicate of that one.\nWhat Happened, and How To Fix It\nIt appears that Ubuntu's installer detected the GRUB installation that belonged to Fedora (or parts of that installation) and decided to \"play it safe\" by not installing GRUB itself. Unfortunately, because the Fedora system doesn't exist anymore, its GRUB installation is non-functional.\nThe solution to this problem is to boot from an Ubuntu live CD/DVD/USB and install Ubuntu's GRUB boot loader. (This may or may not be a different version of GRUB than your Fedora system used. The issue here is that parts of the currently installed GRUB boot loader were located inside your Fedora system, and no longer exist. The corresponding parts of GRUB need to be installed in the Ubuntu system instead.)\nTo reinstall GRUB to your MBR and fix this problem, use any of the methods presented in either of these places:\n\n*\n\n*How can I repair grub? (How to get Ubuntu back after installing Windows?)\n\n*Reinstalling GRUB 2 - Fixing a Broken System\nIn my opinion, the non-chrooting live terminal method or Boot Repair are usually easiest. Please note that you only have to use one method to achieve this. (Unless that fails. Then you might want to try another one.)\n(Optional Reading) Some Technical Details About the Problem\nThe GRUB boot loader installs a small part of itself to a disk's boot record. Unlike some more minimalistic boot loaders (e.g., SYSLINUX, LILO), GRUB won't fit into a boot record, so the part it installs there serves to bootstrap into your main GRUB installation, which is located on a partition somewhere and typically is managed by one of your installed operating systems.\nYour BIOS (or another boot loader) examines the boot record, executes the GRUB bootstrap code that's there, and that then hands off control to the fully-fledged GRUB installation in a partition.\nJudging from your error message (mainly: error: disk 'lvm/fedora-boot' not found.), it appears that the GRUB bootstrap installed to your Master Boot Record points to the full GRUB installation in the Fedora system. That system no longer exists.\nThe solution, as explained above, is to make the GRUB bootstrap in the MBR point to the working GRUB installation in the Ubuntu system's partition (a partition which, unlike Fedora's LVM, does still exist on your system). This is the process colloquially referred to as \"reinstalling GRUB to the MBR\" or \"repairing GRUB.\"\n", "Q: Single bluetooth keyboard on multiple computers?

If you install alongside Windows, something like this will appear:\n\n OR  \nyou can just make some free space in windows and start your ubuntu installation.Choose to install alongside windows and ubuntu will be installed in the free space.\n\nA: If you run Ubuntu alongside Windows, I think they do all the partitioning for you.  However, I had a devilish time installing Ubuntu to run alongside Windows 8 in UEFI mode.\nI had to go through BIOS and install in Legacy ROM mode with boot to CD first in the lineup.\n\n*\n\n*When I wanted Windows, I would switch to UEFI.\n\n*When I wanted Ubuntu, I would switch to Legacy ROM mode.\n\nWith that said, I shrunk my Windows OS partition to its bare minimum in Windows first -- all of your extra GB will automatically go into a different partition.\nNext I installed Ubuntu in Legacy ROM mode -- it will not give you the option to run alongside Windows. It will give you two options: one to install Ubuntu and erase everything (don't do that) and another to just install and create your own partitions, (do that one). It will ask you to partition and it will show you your new partition with all your unused GB.\nYou will have to create 4 partitions, here are the steps:\n\n*\n\n*Click on the unused GB partition give it about 6GB mark it Linux swap.\n\n*Click on the same unused partition and click on \" / \" give it about 100GB (or whatever you want).\n\n*Click on the same unused partition click on  \" /home \" give it about 100GB (or whatever you want).\n\n*When you continue, it will tell you that you need one more partition with 1MB, then continue with the installation.\n\nIf you don't mind switching at startup in BIOS between UEFI (Windows) and Legacy ROM mode (Ubuntu), this may be a tolerable solution. When I got used to Ubuntu, I saved the Windows 8 program on a disk and completely got rid of it, reinstalled Ubuntu and all of the partition problems became resolved.\nKeep in mind that if you figure out how to do it in UEFI, it still holds. Create your partitions when installing Ubuntu, choose \"install and create your own partitions\".\n\nA: I am running Windows 8 right now dual booting Ubuntu on a Lenovo Twist.  I freed space on Windows, then booted with a Linux Live USB.  From here it often goes to a prompt no operating system detected.  I was trying to install 13.10.  Because of this I picked \"Do something else.\"  From here I selected a partition all EXT4 and primary (because I'm using UEFI) for /boot /home and /.  I installed and it all works fine.  \nJust realize Linux can't write to NTFS very well if it is with Windows 8.  So a common share drive is recommended in EXFAT.  Also, if you make FAT partitions in Windows for Linux it can't see files over 4GB if they are FAT32.  \n", "Q: Color Calibration in Ubuntu and Xerox 8570 printer The thumbnail size images show normal color of object. After double-clicking an image, appears off-color like it's shaded red. Printed photos are also off color. Ubuntu color setting states Xerox Phaser 8500DN is uncalibrated. I've been searching and searching and can't find any hints on how to fix this. My knowledge regarding Ubuntu (& PC's) is on the low side of moderate. I don't want to keep downloading stuff I know nothing about - any suggestions out there beside throwing my computer out the window.\n\nA: Little theory. For each device, printer or monitor there is a ICC profile (ICC profile is a set of data that characterizes a color input or output device, or a color space (C) Wiki). If you want to find a match you can change settings of printer or monitor or both. As I understand you want to change only monitor settings. First of all try using different viewers, they can give different output on the same monitor. Second, check that problem is realy in output devices, not in pictures itself.\nThere is a usefull tool for managing ICC profiles, for sure it will help with monitor, check if it can help with printer. https://apps.ubuntu.com/cat/applications/natty/gnome-color-manager/\n", "Q: If I upgrade from Ubuntu 12.10 to 13.04, and then to 13.10 and so...

I think I borked my Wine install.\nIs there a way I can \"start fresh\", so to speak--completely uninstall everything Wine-related and start over? \n\nA: Simple to solve without command line or sudo.  Just delete the ~/.wine directory that is in your home folder (were ~ is shorthand for /home/username or /home/$USER).  You will have to show hidden files to find it.  Wine will automatically rebuild this directory the next time you use it.\nWhile this is the quick and easy way it does leave leftover entries in ~/.local/share/applications.  Just browse to this folder and delete the unwanted files/directories left from installed Wine apps.  If you don't do this the removed apps will still be listed in your desktop menus even though they are no longer installed.\nI use playonlinux to help with Wine.  It makes it easier and it allows each program you install to be in it's own little separate virtual Windows drive.  So if you have this problem again you just delete that programs directory instead of all of your Wine stuff.\n\nA: I have a script with the following entries that I run to remove all wine related in my home directory:\nrm -Rf $HOME/.wine*\nrm -f  $HOME/.local/share/mime/packages/x-wine-e*\nrm -f  $HOME/.local/share/mime/application/x-wine-*\nrm -f  $HOME/.local/share/icons/hicolor/*/apps/application-x-wine-*\nrm -f  $HOME/.local/share/applications/wine-*\nrm -f  $HOME/.local/share/desktop-directories/wine-*\nrm -f  $HOME/.local/share/icons/hicolor/*/apps/7765_*\nrm -f  $HOME/.config/menus/applications-merged/wine-*\n\nSome entries are due to Office installations and may not always apply.

I'm running Kubuntu 13.04_x64 on my Sony Vaio SVE171E13L.  The notebook has an AMD Radeon HD7650M graphics card.  Up until now, I've been using the AMD proprietary driver (AMD Catalyst 13.4).\nAfter building the 3.10 (now 3.10.1) kernel, however, I no longer had a graphical interface!\nIt turns out that 3.10 has introduced a major change in the /proc filesystem API.  (According to the bug report for broken fglrx driver.)\nThe fglrx driver no longer builds.  I tried purging the proprietary driver and installing the open source driver with no success.  In retrospect, that's not surprising, as the open source driver is an older version of the AMD driver.\nI also tried the beta Catayst 13.6, but that didn't work either.

I am very new to Ubuntu and Linux in general, so any advice is appreciated. I am following the \"Dual-Boot Windows 7 and Ubuntu in Perfect Harmony\" tutorial on Lifehacker to do exactly that. This is the link. I am at the step of partitioning my system, I already have windows installed but i am in the Ubuntu Live. When i go into the GParted Partition Editor and try and select \"new\" I get this message:\n\nIt is not possible to create more than 4 primary partitions.\nIf you want more partitions you should first create an extended\n  partition. Such a partition can contain other partitions. Because an\n  extended partition is also a primary partition it might be necessary\n  to remove a primary partition first\n\nThats all!\nWow!

Anyways, here is the picture:\n\nAlso, i forgot to tell you, but i am on a laptop for this project, if that changes anything.\nthanks for all of you help so far!\n\nA: \nDisclaimer: always take a current backup of your hard disk prior to playing around with partitions.\nNote1: GParted \"records\" the actions that we're doing, so it's not actually creating or deleting any partitions until we hit Apply. So, if you mess up before applying, just undo or close and reopen GParted.\nNote2: your screenshot shows a low battery. Ensure that your laptop is plugged into a power source and charging.\n\n\n\n*\n\n*Copy all the contents of the Data partition to your C drive, or to an external storage device, because we're going to delete it. You can do this normally in Windows, or you can do this in Live Ubuntu. In Live Ubuntu, if you move your mouse to the bottom of the Launcher on the left, you'll find a couple of hard disk icons. Clicking them will mount and open up the partitions.\n\n*In Live Ubuntu, open up GParted. Right click and \"Unmount\" the partitions if you opened them up (if you followed the previous step).\n\n*Right click on sda4 > Delete.\n\n*Right click on the now large unallocated > New:\n\n\n*\n\n*Create as: Extended Partition\n\n*Click Add.\n\n\n*Right click on the new unallocated (which is nested under \"New Partition\") > New:\n\n\n*\n\n*Create as: Logical Partition (you shouldn't be able to change it anyways.)\n\n*File system: ntfs\n\n*Label: Data\n\n*Free space preceding: 0\n\n*New size: 181524\n\n*\n\n*This is 177 GB.

Cross your fingers. Pray. Take another look. If you're satisfied, click the green check mark in GParted to apply. This shouldn't take too long, maybe 10 minutes maximum...probably take a few seconds =/.\n\n*At this point, you can boot back into Windows and copy back your Data stuff, or continue with installing Ubuntu since you're already in Live Ubuntu.\nNow, you have an unallocated space that can be used to create new partitions and install Ubuntu.\nThere are several ways from here to install Ubuntu. I would highly advise this:\n\n\n*\n\n*Click on the Install Ubuntu to Hard Disk icon in the Launcher on the left (second icon from top).\n\n*When presented with options, choose Install Ubuntu alongside Windows 7. This will basically take care of everything. It will detect the free, unallocated space, and install itself there, along with creating an essential partition called swap. It will not touch your other Windows partitions. The only thing that can go wrong here is bootloader stuff, where you might not get a screen to \"choose\" which OS, and it just boots into Ubuntu or Windows. This can be fixed using Boot-Repair, but I doubt that it'll get to this point.\n\n*When it's done, reboot your computer (and don't forget to remove your USB/CD so that you don't boot into Live Ubuntu), and you should be presented with options to choose your OS. At this point, I like to first boot into Windows to make sure that it boots successfully. When it does, shutdown and boot into Ubuntu...and enjoy.\n\n\nA: You can use my FixParts program to convert your current /dev/sda4 partition from primary to logical, which will automatically create a containing extended partition in the process. You might then need to reboot and use GParted to resize the extended partition to cover all the disk's free space so that the Ubuntu installer can use it. This procedure is likely to be much less of a hassle than what Alaa has outlined. I do agree with his recommendation to back up your data, though -- any partition manipulation is inherently at least a little risky and can result in massive data loss. Although that risk is low, the cost of recovery can be very high, so having a backup is a worthwhile precaution.\n\nA: The ubuntu dualboot will detect the unallocated space and install ubuntu on that part.\nIf you are using windows 7 there is a partition tool (search for it in the startbutton meny) where you can handle your partitions and resize them.\n", "Q: Unable to access “44 GB Volume” Error mounting /dev/sda2 I have a Compaq laptop which received a bump yesterday.

And with router in a middle then it suppose to be simpler I think.\n\nA: \nIf one for instance server is running on windows can client be on Ubuntu?\n\nThe TCP/IP suite is the TCP/IP suite. It does not matter if that runs on Ubuntu, Windows or any other OS. The data on the network is in a well described format, regardless of the OS or even the CPU's Endianness.\n\nCan I just write the code in eclipse compile and run it or I need first to perform some configuration in terminal window for Linux?\n\nTo use TCP over IP (or UDP over IP, or ICMP) you will need to configure the network the regular way. There is nothing special of different between you have learned how to do that in windows or in a Linux distribution.\n\nI want to understand and learn how to send data wireless form one PC to another without using ROUTER in a middle if it's possible?\n\nThat is called an ad-hoc wireless network. Your wireless cards needs to support that.\n\nAnd with router in a middle then it suppose to be simpler I think\n\nI assume that with router you mean a wireless access point?\nBecause a normal router does not do wireless.\n(Disclaimer: many devices are a combination of (Fibre|ADSL-)modem, router and wireless access point. However these are still separate function and you really should understand how things work.)\nI suggest that you start with learning the basic way how TCP/IP works and then look up how wireless works. If you still have problems after that come back and ask a specific single question.\nThis is a nice place to start.\n", "Q: Activate ZFS Snapshots I accidentally delete some files from my zfs pool and tried to mount the latest snapshots but i just figured out that i have no snapshots.

However you could disable snapshots for specific dataset by setting com.sun:auto-snapshot dataset property to false\nsudo zfs set com.sun:auto-snapshot=false tank/tmp\n\nYou could also use com.sun:auto-snapshot:... properties to tune auto snapshot behaviour. E.g. save snapshots daily for 31 days for tank/backup dataset:\nsudo zfs set com.sun:auto-snapshot=true tank/backup\nsudo zfs set com.sun:auto-snapshot:monthly=false tank/backup\nsudo zfs set com.sun:auto-snapshot:weekly=false tank/backup\nsudo zfs set com.sun:auto-snapshot:daily=true tank/backup\nsudo zfs set com.sun:auto-snapshot:hourly=false tank/backup\nsudo zfs set com.sun:auto-snapshot:frequent=false tank/backup\n\nBy default script saves:\n\n\n*\n\n*frequent snapshots every 15 mins, keeping 4 snapshots\n\n*hourly snapshots every hour, keeping 24 snapshots\n\n*daily snapshots every day, keeping 31 snapshots\n\n*weekly snapshots every week, keeping 7 snapshots\n\n*monthly snapshots every month, keeping 12 snapshots\n\n", "Q: ZFS Raid1-z replace Disk I inted one of my disk from the lower raid1z setup and i was wondering what is the best way to do it, what a re the steps.\n    NAME                                    STATE     READ WRITE CKSUM\n    Misu                                    ONLINE       0     0     0\n      raidz1-0                              ONLINE       0     0     0\n        scsi-SATA_ST3000DM001-9YN_Z1F1587B  ONLINE       0     0     0\n        scsi-SATA_ST3000DM001-9YN_Z1F14J7V  ONLINE       0     0     0\n        scsi-SATA_ST3000DM001-9YN_Z1F14JYL  ONLINE       0     0     0\n        scsi-SATA_ST3000DM001-1CH_W1F1G04F  ONLINE       0     0     0\n        scsi-SATA_ST3000DM001-1CH_W1F1G1H7  ONLINE       0     0     0\n\nWill the lower command do the trick? do i have to do something more?\nzpool offline Misu scsi-SATA_ST3000DM001-1CH_W1F1G04F\nShutdown and replace drive (i'm replacing the disk in the same slot so basicly the sd* shall be the same, even if is not the same i will change it accordingly)\nzpool replace Misu scsi-SATA_ST3000DM001-1CH_W1F1G04F\n\nA: That is the correct way, except the system shutdown is not necessary.\n", "Q: How can I make changes to the boot options?

If so, it should show you your recovery DVD as a boot option. (If not, be sure the DVD is inserted and hit the Esc key.) If this doesn't work, then there's something seriously screwy about your firmware. (Perhaps a firmware update would help.)

I'm trying to set up an IOGear GPSU21 print server with the same printer.\nMy 12.04 laptop printed to this printer without issue when it was on the XP box. When printing through the GPSU21, I get the following status, and the printing fails: \"Processing - Error writing spool: NT_STATUS_IO_TIMEOUT\"\nThis laptop dual-boots to Win7, and I can print to the printer through the GPSU21 fine there.\nI followed the suggestions here: http://ubuntuforums.org/announce.html?t=1658955 but they didn't help. (Those suggestions are to add \"Allow all\" directives in several of the location tags in the /etc/cups/cupsd.conf file.)\nAny suggestions on where to go from here? Thanks!\n\nA: I have and use that very same print server. First, find out in the administration pages of your router the IP address of the print server. Set the router to reserve the IP address assigned so that the address doesn't change.\nNext, I set up the printer with the Device URI of ipp://192.168.1.xx:631/lp1. Substitute the reserved IP address for 192.168.1.xx here. Then select the make, model and driver for your printer and print a test page.\nA very few printers are subject to a bug: https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/cups/+bug/945028 If you get the mentioned error, then try the Device URI of ipp14://192.168.1.xx:631/lp1. \nThe lp1 part comes from the manual of the IOGear.\n", "Q: Nautilus Script for ESET scanner I have installed Eset antivirus as per the instructions given here All is working well but instead of gui I want to have a responsive terminal option available too thus I created a symlink via:\nsudo ln -s /opt/eset/esets/sbin/esets_scan /bin/eset\nnow I can siimply run eset <destination> along with further flags to get the job done. Provided the eset by default scan all subdirectories in said destination I want to hava a nautilus script that sits in my context & whenever I want I right-click a folder (& using this script) be able to scan that folder.\nOf coarse I want the terminal to remain open so that I can see the progress & logs, in my attempts the scan initiates but as soon as it is done terminal quits :(\n\nA: So, the only thing you like is for the terminal to remain there after the scan completed? That's pretty easy. In the last line of your script add the command read.\neg.\n#!/bin/bash\n....Your script....\nread\n\nA: I am not sure if my answer will still be relevant, since You posted Your question quite some time ago...\nNevertheless, I was wondering the same and came up with a solution I would like to share with others who would like to achieve the same:\n(tested on Ubuntu-gnome 16.04 LTS, 4.4.0-62-generic)\n1.) Enable eset-NOD32 scan via the command terminal (as already posted by OP)\nAdd a symbolic link in /bin to the default installation directory ( /opt/eset/esets/sbin/esets_scan) to allow for the execution of 'esets_scan' via the terminal command 'esets /DIRECTORY':\nsudo ln -s /opt/eset/esets/sbin/esets_scan /bin/eset\n\n2.) Configure nautilus-actions to enable threat-scanning via 'right-click'\n[Note: for this to work You will have to use the nautilus file manager.]\nInstall the nautilus file manager configuration tool: nautilus-actions\nsudo apt-get install nautilus-actions\n\nOnce installed, we open nautilus-actions and configure the 'Eset-ThreatScan' action:\n\n\n*\n\n*create a new action (click on the '+')\n\n*go to the 'Action' tab. Under 'Nautilus Item' check following options:\n\n\n*\n\n*'Display item in selection context menu'\n\n*Context label: type in 'Eset-ThreatScan'\n\n*'Display item in the toolbar\n\n*'Use same label for icon in the toolbar'\n\n\n*go to the 'Command' tab. Under 'Command' enter the following specifications\n\n\n*\n\n*Path: eset\n\n*Parameters: %B\n\n*Working directory: %d\n\n\n*go to the 'Execution' tab. Under 'Execution mode' check the following:\n\n\n*\n\n*'Display output'\n\n\n\nSave the configuration by clicking on the menu: 'File'>'Save'.\nClose nautilus actions and restart nautilus (you may need to pkill nautilus):\npkill nautilus\n\n3.) Scan with eset via right-click\nSimply 'right-click' on a selection (i.e. selected [multiple] folders or files) and select 'Nautilus Action actions'>'Eset - ThreatScan' in the in the up-popping 'right-click' menu.\nThe scan will be running silently in the background. Once the scan is finished, a pop-up will appear displaying the output-streams (including summary, errors and scan results, so the same as when run via the terminal).\nYou can close the pop-up by either clicking on 'OK', or pressing 'Alt'+'F4.\nHope this helps making Your life easier.\nCheers.\n", "Q: Ubuntu 13.04 only sometimes starts: \"no System-disk or disk error\" I just installed Ubuntu 13.04 on my HP 2530p Laptop with no other OS installed. \nAll worked well but when restarting, after the BIOS screen, there was just a blank black screen reading \"no system-disk or disk error\".\nRestarting multiple times, Ubuntu started normally. But upon the next restart, the same happened: \"no system-disk or disk error\" and I needed to repeat this procedure.\nAccording to the \"disk\"-utility, my disk (Toshiba, 120 GB) is 47 Celcius degrees warm and has no disk errors.\nIs this a Ubuntu-problem or a Grub-Problem (no Grub menue pops up because there is no choice at the start)?\n\nA: This may happen if your boot device (hard disk drive, or CD-ROM drive) does not contain boot files.  To resolve this issue, try one of these, and then restart your computer:\n\n\n*\n\n*Remove any CD/DVD from the optical drive\n\n*Change your computer's boot sequence, to boot from the bootable\ndevice. (this is done from the system BIOS)\n\n*Make sure an OS is installed on the hard drive.\n\n\nIf non of these work,  may have a hardware problem with your hard drive.  Go to the Toshiba website, and see if they have a bootable tool to test the drive with.\n\nA: I'm not allowed to add a comment and this is not a complete answer, but I have the same problem with my ASUS KJ52. With me it helps to change the root paramater in grub from UUID to the real name of the root partition, say /dev/sda3. Also there's no problem booting Debian.\n\nA: I had a similar problem in installing ubuntu 18.04 on a new SSD disk without any other OS. Installation was complete successfully but after a restart, I had encountered this error.\nThis problem was solved by connecting the SSD disk SATA cable to the SATA0 socket on the motherboard. This affects determining master/slave disk apparently.\n", "Q: elementary-theme package broken, how do I fix it?

I am new to Ubuntu and some little thing started bugging me. When I try to install a program, Ubuntu asks:\nDo you want to continue[Y/n]?\n\nWhat is bugging me is why the letter Y is upper case and n is lower case. Whatever case I enter it doesn't change the outcome: it either continues or not.\nDo they have any significant reason why one is upper and the latter is lower? Are they trying to notify us that we can enter both and it won't change anything?\n\nA: Usually, the uppercase option (Y in your case) is the default option if you don't provide any and just press ↲ Enter. This is a convention I see very often on the command line.\nI wish I could provide a credible source, but I fail to find one. However, this is something I see very often in Debian/Ubuntu systems, in various programs.\nThe closest \"source\" I could find is a Q&A on Stack Overflow: Standard format for yes/no questions in the terminal?\n\nA: Many Unix/Linux terminal programs do not support even bold or colored text and so conventions like this are used to distinguish the default value if you just pressed ENTER without any text (because it's faster).\nMost (well written) programs will accept either upper or lowercase responses (i.e. 'Y','y','N', or 'n').\nA lot of these programs are shell scripts so changing the default for a prompt like this is usually not difficult.\n", "Q: Double bluetooth icons My taskbar shows double bluetooth icons when my bluetooth is activated:\n\nWhen I click the rightmost I get to see this menu:\n\nAnd this is the menu of the icon to the left:\n\nThe 'about' window:\n\nHow do I merge the icons, or remove them?\n\nA: To solve this issue, Blueman needs to be uninstalled:\npkill blueman\nsudo apt-get purge blueman\n\nThe icons are now gone. To access the bluetooth settings now, you need to go to your system settings.\n", "Q: Power Indicator gone missing Ubuntu 13.04 I am using Ubuntu 13.04 32-bit for quite some time on Acer Aspire One AOD255 netbook and today I found out that power indicator icon is missing from unity panel.

I am using an Asus X501A1 notebook. When I install Ubuntu on it it does not require any extra driver installation to function properly.\nI am curious about this - are the drivers installed on my computer open source?\n\nA: Mostly yes, everything that works out of the box is using open source drivers, included in the kernel (or for graphics some user space part in Xorg libraries).\nOne exception is the firmware that is needed for some devices. It is loaded at hardware initialization for some wireless/wired network adapters, sound cards etc. to function properly.

Playing World of Warcraft through Crossover, and in Ubuntu 13.04.

It offers a search for every entry in the program menu. I'm not sure how to uninstall it, though. The HUD itself is contained in the package hud, but removing it will likely give the alt key another function.

I have an Acer Aspire One AO751H, and I've got two Ubuntu versions on it:  10.04.4 LTS Netbook Edition (which I keep around mainly because I really like the user interface) and 12.04.2 LTS.  I have one primary and one extended partition, the former containing 10.04 alone, and the latter having 12.04 with its 2GB swap partition.  My question is:  will 10.04 recognize and use the swap space in the extended partition, or do I have to enable that?  If so, what is the procedure for doing so?  Any help would be much appreciated. \n\nA: If the 10.04 is already installed, then the answer is no. It will not automatically use the swap partition. You have to manually add the partition to your fstab file. See the following for how to do that:\nHow do I add a swap partition after system installation?\nhttps://help.ubuntu.com/community/SwapFaq#How_do_I_add_more_swap.3F (section \"Activating the swap partition\")\nIf the 10.04 is not installed yet, you can configure it to use the pre-existing swap partition during installation (you have to select the manual partitioning option to do that).\nImportant: be careful as the current implementation of hibernation (suspend to disk) in Ubuntu uses the swap partition. That means if you hibernate one of the installations it will write the contents of RAM into the swap partition, which may lead to problems if you start the second installation before resuming the first.\n", "Q: How to install compiz-plugin-extras and make it work correctly?

These have been available for 12.04 and were dropped in 12.10 and up. It's pretty said, I loved them as well.

Just run gksudo nautilus (or sudo nautilus) in Terminal to start the file manager Nautilus with root privilegies. (if you are using the default Ubuntu distro from Canonical). Now you can add any files to the htdocs directory. But this way you should be careful, because you can harm your system, if you delete some files or folders by a mistake.\n\n*To own the permissions of the directory htdocs to your user account (because htdocs is in the /opt directory, which is owned by the root by default). Open Terminal and run the following command:\nsudo chown -R yourusername:yourusername /opt/lampp/htdocs/\n\nIf you choose the second way, use this only for development, not for production.

How can I retian data and settings? I have Ubuntu installed on a USB flash drive.  It works fairly well.  But every time I exit the system, it erases all newly created data and settings.  E.g., the add-nos in Firefox are deleted and all the other settings, like bookmarks.  All downloaded files are deleted.  When I boot up the system again, only the original system appears.\nHow can I get Ubuntu to not delete the settings and newly added data upon exiting the system?\n\nA: Assuming you created your USB with persistence, you are probably experiencing bug 1159016 on a UEFI machine.  Try booting on a non UEFI machine to see if persistence works.  The fix for a UEFI boot is to edit the /boot/grub/grub.cfg file on the USB and add the word \"persistent\" to the linux line.\n\nA: A normal install on a USB stick is like a LiveCD. When you shut down everything goes. The alternative (the magic word) is \"persistant\" . With a persistant USB stick you can save SOME things but NOT ALL.\npendrivelinux.com tells you (http://www.pendrivelinux.com/what-is-persistent-linux):\n(Among the advantages)\n\"Portability – Bookmarks, settings, system preferences, customizations and file downloads can in most cases be stored and retrieved when booting from different or multiple machines.\"\nand\n(Among the disadvantages)\n\"Some changes are not saved persistently – In some cases, further modification is required to enable things like graphical card settings and network card settings to be saved. In some cases, system wide updates do not work.\"\n\nA: If it is booting, and off of a fat32 formatted drive, you could make a casper-rw file:\nhttp://www.pendrivelinux.com/how-to-create-a-larger-casper-rw-loop-file/\ndon't make this bigger than 4 GB\nThen edit the menu file (I forget the name of the file) in the root of the USB drive and add the word persistent right before the -- at the end of the line\nIt sounds like you did not hit the radio button for \"persistence\" when you used the Ubuntu USBCreator, so therefore it was not created.\nYou could just redo the making of the bootable USB and make sure you choose that option.  Make sure you reformat the drive first.  In reality, you'll need no less than 1024 MB or you will run out of space fast\n\nA: Use a program called unetbootin to set up Ubuntu on your drive. It can put Ubuntu on a flash drive and you can set \"persistance.\" The more persistence space you set, the more size you will have to store files. Persistence is only available for Ubuntu using Unetbootin. \n", "Q: Which graphic driver should I install?

Each partition is mounted at a particular point in the unified directory tree -- for instance, at /home, /var, or /usr. Because the /home directory holds users' home directories, putting it on a separate partition isolates user data from system data. Other directories can be isolated in a similar manner. This can be useful in performing backups, for security reasons, to help simplify system upgrades, and so on.\nThis is different from Windows, which is much more haphazard in the way files are managed -- in Windows, you might create a partition and populate it with both program files and user data files. In some sense this is more flexible, but it also encourages a type of unstructured and inconsistent setup that would make a professional Linux/Unix administrator cringe.\nIn any event, for most desktop systems, if you split /home off from /, the latter need be no larger than 5-30GiB, depending on how much software you install. Installing software updates won't greatly increase the space demands, since the new software replaces existing software, so the space required won't go up much. There are exceptions to this rule, of course; for instance, most servers store data in /var, so if you run a Web server with gobs of Web pages, you may need lots of space in /var (and might therefore consider splitting it off into its own partition).\nIt's unclear from the original question just how those three partitions are being used. Those sizes might be reasonable for some purposes, but I suspect they were chosen based on previous experience with Windows. If one partition is actually filling up, it might be better to resize the partitions and use them in a more Unix/Linux-like way than to try to move data between the partitions. More details about where the partitions are mounted, how full they are, and what's being stored on them would be helpful in providing more specific advice.\nFor more general information on this topic, see this introductory article I wrote on the subject or read the Filesystem Hierarchy Standard (FHS).\n", "Q: Touchpad permanently disabled after using ambient light sensor button I am using an HP/Compaq 8710p and it has an ambient light sensor enable/disable button using Fn+F11. I enabled the ambient light sensor and a notification popped up saying, \"Touchpad disabled.\" After pressing Fn+F11 again, the light sensor disabled, but the touchpad still does not work. How do I go about re-enabling the touchpad, and possibly fixing the ambient light sensor to not use the touchpad? I am using Kubuntu 13.04.\n\nA: I think that problem is because Fn + F11 button has code 0xB3 which is mapped to button \"disable touchpad\".  The solution is, to remap that code to another button. You can use the program showkey to verify key code.\nI had same problem with my HP EliteBook 8460p and I created a path for udev which fixed it:\n\n\n*\n\n*Step 1\n\n*Step 2\nMaybe you should contact ubuntu/udev developers that your notebook (with DMI info) needs similar udev hook too.\n", "Q: Disable automatic screen dimming I currently have three computers running Ubuntu.

It is currently not possible to install the Friends app in 12.04.\nLong answer:\nGwibber has been rewritten in QML/Qt5 and some of the required packages are not available for 12.04. So could I just manually download and install the required packages? you ask. Theoretically you could, and I tried it, but after upgrading a package for a dependency of a dependency of a dependency and breaking a few system wide dependencies in the process I gave up.\nSo, theoretically: yes, you could upgrade and install the needed packages.\nIn reality, no.

I've searched for a way, but there hasn't been a definite way to do this.  So...\nI want to install Debian next to a Ubuntu 12.04.1 install on an old Mac Mini I have colocated with MacMiniColo.  I have plenty of room (500 gig HD), but I need to ether:\n\n\n*\n\n*Remove the swap partition and install Debian in it...\n\n*...or, resize the main Ubuntu partition (which is root, formatted EXT4), of which 60 gigs are used.\n\n\nI want to do the latter, shrinking it down by 80 gigs to safely put in a Debian install.  Of course, I'll back everything up beforehand.  But this means needing to shrink a partition ether live or be triggered on reboot (the Raspberry Pi's Raspbian offshoot of Debian Wheezy does this).  \nGoing to the colo facility and shoving in a liveCD is NOT an option! I'm in Baltimore, the colo is in Las Vegas, and I don't want to have a tech there run gparted on it if I can help it.\nEther way, I have to be dangerous.  It's because Canonical worries me now.\n\nA: I would suggest that you have a tech at the colo facility boot into a live CD and enable SSH. You could then SSH into the server and run gparted from your own computer.\n\nA: The swap partition route you mentioned is probably the best way to go.  Install a minimal system there with debootstrap and reboot into it, then you can use a combination of resize2fs and parted to shrink the filesystem, then delete and recreate the partition with a smaller size ( at least what you shrank the filesystem to ) and the exact same start sector it had before.\nOf course, this is very risky without any alternate means of gaining console control of the system and/or being able to force it to netboot to recover should you do something wrong, so you likely will end up having to go to the facility or call and have someone there boot the machine from a known system that has remote access enabled anyway.\n", "Q: Why is my Ubuntu 12.04 not booting after GRUB?

I have tried LiliUSB creator, pendrive linux usb creator, and unetbootin. All three have given me the same result. When I select my flash drive from the BIOS to boot into, it successfully shows the GRUB menu. The GRUB menu however, is black instead of purple that I've seen when normally booting Ubuntu.

I'm currently using a live CD and I am attempting to delete everything off of my harddrive. So, I've used the command sudo nautilus and attempted to delete everything off of my SSD. However, I cannot delete the folder rofs (Read only file system). I generally would have absolutely no issues with this, however, I believe it is causing everything I delete to come back to life upon restarting the computer.\nPrior to using Nautilus to do this, I've used sudo shred -vz -n 1 /dev/sda2, and dd if=/dev/zero of=/dev/sda2 but it doesn't seem to work. The grub loader still exists, I wish to demolish it, and preferably all other files. \nHow can I remove the grub loader, and if possible, how can I delete the rofs folder entirely?\n\nA: IF your trying to delete everything, why not use\n$sudo gparted\n\nto simply reformat? That would get rid of everything... period.\nAlso ROFS might refer to the medium that the live distro is written/burned/saved on (I could be wrong).\n\nA: Maybe your grub resides on MBR, and by dd-ing all of /dev/sda2 you just get ride of your data, files and folders, not your boot loader.\nOn the other hand, If you loose your boot loader, you can't boot up with that disk at all.\nSo, after deleting the content, use\nsudo fdisk /dev/sda\n\nTo remove that partition and write changes to table.\nWhen that partition (dev/sda2) is completely gone and shown as free space, you're done. (still you can low-level format to make sure recovering is almost impossible.)\nLow-level formatting is a procedure where you write data directly to the storage medium, bypassing the filesystem layer.\n", "Q: Video Editor where I can select specific areas I am looking for a Video Editor that I can use to select specific areas it different time frames. For example, in a video that is 1920x1080 let's say I want in the first minute to only show an area of 1024x768 located in an area of the total 1920x1080. Then after that I want to select another area in another part. The end result should show the video with only the selected areas.\nThis is because there is a lot of parts that do not correspond to what I want to show in the video.\nI tried Pitivi, OpenShot and Avidemux. None have an option to select an area of the video.\n\nA: Avconv/ffmpeg\nWhenever we do not find an option to do a specific task we may find a command line tool more promising.\nTo achieve a video with clipped content from a time segment of our source we basically need the video filters trim, and crop from avconv/ffmpeg (whichever you prefer to use). Please read the documentation in the libav manual sections for all options.\nBelow example will produce a video from the first minute of our source with cropping a central area of 1024x768.\navconv -i <inputfile> -vf trim 0:60 crop=out_w=1024:out_h=768 <outputfile>\n\nCropping from another position than the center will need different parameters which can very nicely be fine-tuned (several examples are given in the libav documentatiton). Audio is not treated in this example. If your video contains audio you may have to trim the audio track as well.\nThe resulting clip will then have to be of course joined again with the orginal video which we will also have to trimm to the beginning, and the end of our transformed clip.\nOpenShot\nThe crop feature is hidden in the clip's properties/layout settings. After we had selected an area (use the Razorblade too) of our clip we may select this sub-clip's properties with a right mouse click.\nIn the now opening menu choose the Layout tab to select an area to clip. Adjust height, width, and X, Y values until you are happy. A preview window will help doing so.\nBelow example uses a video with a constant view on the scene (as it is shown in the lower screen shot).\n\nEnlarged to 200 % at the start of the clip\n\nBack to 100 % at the end of the clip\nSmooth transition\nIn the example above I started with a clipped region of the video at the beginning of my sample video fragment zoomed to 200% (\"Start of Clip\"). By undoing the enlagement at the end of my fragment to 100 % (\"End of Clip\") OpenShot will render a smooth transition between the two extremes (200% -> 100%) very much as if we had operated the camera zoom. With values for X or Y we can do the same resluting in an camera shift movement from the beginning to the end of the clip.\nStatic crop\nIn case we want a static clipped area only we just make the effect's value the same for the beginning and the end of the clip.\nDetails: OpenShot Manual\n", "Q: a few questions before updating to 13.04 About a month ago I updated my computer through the update manager.

You can only skip releases if you are upgrading from an LTS release to another LTS.  \nNow that being said,  and you do want 13.04, I would recommend a fresh install of it, but before you install it, or even update, download 13.04, and try it without installing, to see if all your hardware is working OK.

Long story short, I need to make it look like my computer has 2GB of Ram, instead of 4GB.

Or you could make a screenshot of your current System Details, photoshop 4GB over it, and write a small script that displays your new image over the regular window. I do NOT recommend either of these methods.

I need to get this sorted because my drives seem to randomly change messing with my links and libraries. 5 of my drives are truecrypt encrypted and as such i can`t use UUID to mount to specific points.\nThis is what i`ve been trying to use. Im running Ubuntu 13.04 ans have saved the file in /lib/udev/rules.d/65-persistent-hdd.rules\n# These are the rules to force all drives into specific /dev/sd** slots for truecrypt mounting\n#\nKERNEL==\"sd*\", SUBSYSTEMS==\" block\", ATTRS{serial}==\"3PK0R7AD\", SYMLINK+=\"sda%n\"\nKERNEL==\"sd*\", SUBSYSTEMS==\" block\", ATTRS{serial}==\"S1UVJ1LZ401091\", SYMLINK+=\"sdb%n\"\nKERNEL==\"sd*\", SUBSYSTEMS==\" block\", ATTRS{serial}==\"S1VSJ1KS202775\", SYMLINK+=\"sdc%n\"\nKERNEL==\"sd*\", SUBSYSTEMS==\" block\", ATTRS{serial}==\"W1F08BLH\", SYMLINK+=\"sdd%n\"\nKERNEL==\"sd*\", SUBSYSTEMS==\" block\", ATTRS{serial}==\"S1Y6J90SA14564\", SYMLINK+=\"sde%n\"\nKERNEL==\"sd*\", SUBSYSTEMS==\" block\", ATTRS{serial}==\"S13PJDWS223047\", SYMLINK+=\"sdf%n\"\n\nSo as you see, im trying to force {serial}==\"3PK0R7AD\" to /dev/sda, {serial}==\"S1UVJ1LZ401091\"to /dev/sdb, etc, etc\n\nA: I'm not 100% certain but I think the problem is SYMLINK+= will use the default /dev/NAME and only add an additional symbolic link. So you probably can't create symbolic links to devices that already exist?\nInstead use NAME=\"sda\"\nFrom http://www.reactivated.net/writing_udev_rules.html\n\n\nAfter you have used a series of match keys to precisely match a device, udev gives you fine control over what happens next, through a range of assignment keys. For a complete list of possible assignment keys, see the udev man page. The most basic assignment keys are introduced below. Others will be introduced later in this document. \n    NAME - the name that shall be used for the device node\n    SYMLINK - a list of symbolic links which act as alternative names for the device node\nAs hinted above, udev only creates one true device node for one device. If you wish to provide alternate names for this device node, you use the symbolic link functionality. With the SYMLINK assignment, you are actually maintaining a list of symbolic links, all of which will be pointed at the real device node. To manipulate these links, we introduce a new operator for appending to lists: +=. You can append multiple symlinks to the list from any one rule by separating each one with a space. \nKERNEL==\"hdb\", NAME=\"my_spare_disk\"\nThe above rule says: match a device which was named by the kernel as hdb, and instead of calling it hdb, name the device node as my_spare_disk. The device node appears at /dev/my_spare_disk.\nKERNEL==\"hdb\", DRIVER==\"ide-disk\", SYMLINK+=\"sparedisk\"\n    The above rule says: match a device which was named by the kernel as hdb AND where the driver is ide-disk. Name the device node with the default name and create a symbolic link to it named sparedisk. Note that we did not specify a device node name, so udev uses the default. In order to preserve the standard /dev layout, your own rules will typically leave the NAME alone but create some SYMLINKs and/or perform other assignments.* \n\n\nIt's not working for me, but I'm not sure where my problem is in my udev rules as debugging doesn't show them even being processed. Hopefully this helps you\nI'm trying to do the same thing and force my devices to be specific /dev/sdX and I know people wonder why do it but some people want that level of control over their devices.\n", "Q: How To Connect to Wireless Network in Lubuntu? Im new to lubuntu have used ubuntu before there is no nm-applet in lubuntu. So how to connect? Pls help\n\nA: Another (easier) way to have the network manager in the panel (bottom right) is this:\nI am quoting from this article: Fix Lubuntu / Xubuntu 14.04 Network Manager Missing From The Panel.\n\nTo fix the Network Manager not showing up on the panel issue, from the\n  Lubuntu menu select Preferences > Default applications for LXSession,\n  then click on the Autostart tab and under \"Manual autostarted\n  applications\" type \"nm-applet\", then click the \"+ Add\" button on the\n  left.\n\nThen log out and log back in. The new icon should be present in the panel - bottom right. Use that icon to manage network connections.\nIf this doesn't work have a look at the link above, there is more to it.\n\nA: Though its been long and many years since this question is posted, yet i find it meaningful to add my experience of facing the same issue with latest lubuntu version ie. 19.04.\nAfter installing lubuntu 19.04, i noticed there is no way to configure wifi connection. Network manager was not listed.\nThere were some of posts which points to download and install driver, but how exactly you can download driver when you dont have internet connection at all.\nAt last i followed below steps which helped me to get rid of problem-\n\n\n*\n\n*You have to provide internet connection to your system in some way. Either use lan cable to connect to broadband modem or use your smart phone's internet.\n\n*I used my android phone. connected through usb cable to my laptop. After connection go to cell phone -- settings --> Network & Internet --> Hotspot and Tethering --> USB Tethring. Turn it on.\n\n*As soon as I turned it on, my laptop running on lubuntu started displaying available wifi networks. i could then connect to my wifi network (it just demanded for wifi password). Lubuntu was using the network support from android device tethering.\nThe problem is not yet solved! If you disconnect your cell phone or switch off ththering, lubuntu laptop will again loose the internet. So you need to install the drivers now to resolve it permanently.\n\n*In your Lubuntu go to Start --> Preferences --> Additional Drivers . Enter you password if asked for. It will open Software Sources. Go to 'Ubuntu Software' tab. \nMake sure all options are checked. Source code you can ignore. Next when you click 'close', it will prompt to upgrade the outdated drivers. Click ok and continue. Let system install new drivers. Let it complete.\n\n*After completion of driver downloads, go to Preferences. You should see Advance Network Configuration' available now. You can disconnect your cell phone now! Internet would continue working fine on you lubuntu system.\nHope it helps!\n\nA: The other answers may take care of things, but the thing that seemed to be important for me is to go to the main menu (\"start menu\") then Preferences -> Additional Drivers, and check to see if your wifi driver is available. Mine, a broadcom driver, was available but not enabled as it is proprietary\n\nA: Try this.  Install Network Manager.  To do that, just press Ctrl+Alt+T on your keyboard to open Terminal. When it opens, run the command(s) below:\nsudo apt-get install network-manager-gnome\n\nOnce done, you can setup the wireless network. type the following command to start the manager:\nnm-applet\n\n\nA: In a terminal issue the command\nsudo ifconfig wlan0 up\nIn the GUI\nGo to Preferences-> Network Connections -> Add\nClick the down arrow next to Ethernet and select Wi-Fi\nIn the window that opens; on the WiFi Tab, type your routers SSID in the box labelled SSID\nGo to the General Tab and make sure the top two boxes are checked (you can modify these to meet your needs)\nGo to the security tab and choose your routers security type (in my case WPA/WPA2 Personal)\nEnter your password in the box labelled password\nSave and close the window\nBack in the terminal issue the command\nsudo dhclient\nCrank up your browser to confirm.\nFull disclosure: This approach is known to work on Lubuntu 14.04 on An Asus F55A Tested and confirmed by me.\n\nA: A major problem with Lubuntu install is the entire lack of a simple warning: a hard wire connection to a router is needed.  Then, for a MacbookPro 13... assuming Lubuntu is installed with all upgrades and updates... Click the bluebird icon at bottom left of display... Click Preferences... Click Additional Drivers and enter password... Click the button for your wireless driver... Wait to install, then reboot... After reboot, click the network icon at bottom right of display... You should now see your wifi connect in the list... Click on yours and enter password... You should now be connected.  \n", "Q: Console is missing my-user@ I've just received a new Ubuntu server at work, however, when logging in via the terminal I'm missing the my-user@server-name in the console.

I am searching a command-line tagging tool that supports ogg-tagging and allows to change encoding to the tags.\n\nA: As @LiveWireBT said in a comment, you can use vorbiscomment, available in the vorbis-tools package.\nvorbiscomment is not really easy to use when you want to replace/edit a single tag, like Genre, because you have only two options: append a tag with -a, or replace ALL TAGS with -w.\nAppending a Genre tag will ADD a Genre tag, not edit the current one.\nWriting a Genre tag will ONLY write the Genre tag, and remove all other tags.\nSo my workaround to modify a tag is the following:\n# dynamically: list tags, edit one with sed, rewrite tags\nvorbiscomment -l file.ogg | sed 's/^genre=.*/GENRE=Black Metal/' | vorbiscomment -w file.ogg\n\n# with a temporary file (it's actually one of the examples in the manpage)\n# (a bit longer/more difficult to use in a for loop,\n# since you can specify only one input file)\nvorbiscomment -l file.ogg > comments.txt\n<edit comments.txt with vim/nano/sed>\nvorbiscomment -w -c comments.txt file.ogg\n\nAbout the encoding of tags, the --raw option might be what you need:\n\n-R, --raw\n  Read and write comments in UTF-8, rather than converting to the user's character set.\n\n\nA: tageditor supports a wide variety of formats, and has both a GUI and CLI interface.\ntageditor set \\\n    album=\"${album}\" \\\n    artist=\"${artist}\" \\\n    title=\"${title}\" \\\n    genre=\"${genre}\" \\\n    --files \"${file}\"\n\n", "Q: RAID 5 Inactive at boot - error: found two disks with the index 1 for RAID md/0 My OS is Ubuntu 12.04.2 LTS with this kernel: 3.2.0-49-generic #75-Ubuntu SMP Tue Jun 18 17:39:32 UTC 2013 x86_64 x86_64 x86_64 GNU/Linux\nI have a raid 5 array composed of 3 hard drives and suddenly, when it started being inactive at boot time. Since the home directory is mounted on it, the system cannot boot and it's asking for manual user intervention.  I found similar reports in forums, but most of them happen to have a defective hard drive which is not the case for me.  \nStopping the array (mdadm --stop /dev/md0) and starting it again (mdadm --assemble --scan /dev/md0) shows no errors (there is no complaining or array rebuilding) and then it can be mounted properly (manual mount) so why it cannot be brought up at boot?\nAfter checking the smartctl for all the hard drives composing the raid array (sda, sdb, sdc), I could not observe any error (no Current_Pending_Sector, UDMA_CRC_Error_Count, Offline_Uncorrectable). Short and long tests have been ran already.\nOne thing I noticed which is mostly the cause of the problem is that grub-probe returns this error: \"error: found two disks with the index 1 for RAID md/0.\"\nRunning the same command with -v (verbose output), I can spot two lines commenting \"grub-probe: info: Found array md/0 (mdraid1x).\" right after probing hd0 and hd1 which are mapped on sda and sdb correspondingly. So sdc doesn't have readable by grub metadata for the raid? People facing this problem suggested to update the raid metadata from 0.90 to 1.x but my raid is already using 1.2.\nI tried to manually make sdc hard drive to fail twice (the first time just removed it and re-added it and the second time by using mdadm --zero-superblock /dev/sdc) and forced the raid to rebuild, but the error cannot go away so now I am stuck. Does anyone have a clue on what the problem might be and how can it be fixed?\nBelow there is a list of commands and their output that I used to diagnose the problem:\n/proc/stat after boot\n# cat

I solved the problem by removing each disk of the raid (one by one), zeroing the superblock and the MBR, added them back to the raid and waited for the rebuild.\nAfter I did that for /dev/sdb, the problem was solved and now the grub-probe shows only one line with \"grub-probe: info: Found array md/0 (mdraid1x).\" instead of two as it happened before (look at the question). \nSo it must be the other way around than what I thought in the beginning about the index error. My thought was that this index should be present in every disk being part of the raid, that's why I was erasing sdc that grub-probe was not showing any \"grub-probe: info: Found array md/0 (mdraid1x).\" message. \nEventually it looks like only one of them must have it and if it is in more than one hard disk this error \"error: found two disks with the index 1 for RAID md/0\" is raised.\n", "Q: Touchpad doesn't work on Fujitsu Lifebook UH552 Recently I bought the laptop with pre-installed Win8 and tried to insall Ubuntu 13.04 beside it.\nI have to say, that the installation was fine, but then some strange things began to happen: first booting Ubuntu I saw that there like was no desktop enviroment, so the windows did not have title bars, panels did not exis.

What is shown is what folders make up the total of the home directory, and hence all the contents of the home directory will add up to 100%. As a clarification, it is shown that the home directory contains 100% of the listed directories and files.\n\n  \n*\n  \n*Storage is on a separate partition, with a symlinked directory in my home folder. Why is it being included in the total? (It isn't more than 1/3 full in any case).\n  \n\nThis might indeed make it a bit hard to interpret the figures. What I do know is that the program will follow symlinks. As to my knowledge, this can't be disabled.\nI am not sure from where the program will get the \"Total filesystem capacity\" data at the top when several filesystems are in play on the scanned path through symlinks.\nFor a clearer view on the file system capacity (capacities), it might be more useful to use the df terminal command. Run with an option, df -hto get human readable file sizes. The command will list the physical drives and the mount points, e.g.:\n$ df -h\nFilesystem               Size  Used Avail Use% Mounted on\n/dev/sda5                158G   51G   99G  34% /\nnone                     4,0K     0  4,0K   0% /sys/fs/cgroup\nudev                     1,9G  4,0K  1,9G   1% /dev\ntmpfs                    386M  1,2M  385M   1% /run\nnone                     5,0M     0  5,0M   0% /run/lock\nnone                     1,9G  1,5M  1,9G   1% /run/shm\nnone                     100M   60K  100M   1% /run/user\ndeskt:/media/Samsung     801G  414G  388G  52% /mnt/deskt/data\ndeskt:/home/carl         113G   40G   68G  37% /mnt/deskt/carl\ndeskt:/tmp               113G   40G   68G  37% /mnt/deskt/tmp\n/dev/sda3                 63G   26G   37G  42% /media/carl/OS\n\nThe /dev/sda? entries will show the capacity and usage of the different partitions.\nOn a side note, a more natural approach of having the home folder on a separate partition would be to mount /home/ to that partition, rather than doing it with a symlink.\n", "Q: Install Ubuntu alongside windows When we install ubuntu along with windows 7 do we need any other drivers other than what we have installed on windows?\n\nA: Driver's for Ubuntu is different from Windows, you might not find all the drivers you have for Windows, graphics drivers can be installed using \"Software Updater\", others you may have to search online in you computer's manufacturer's website.\n\nA: Ubuntu comes packaged with generic drivers for a lot of hardware available so all your hardware will probably work out-of the-box. In special circumstances, you will need to install proprietary drivers (this is for instancey the case for NVidia graphics cards).

Keep in mind that Ubuntu labels drive different than Windows.  So you won't see C, D, E, etc. instead you will see sda, sdb, etc.  \nIf your D drive is not a physical drive, but a partition, you will see /dev/sda1, /dev/sda2.  sda1 being your C drive, and sda2 is you D drive.\nBe sure that you select the right hard. /dev/sda is the first physical hard drive. /dev/sdb is the second hard drive in your machine. So, make sure that you know which is the one you want to format.  Otherwise, you will lose ALL YOUR DATA on that hard drive.\n\nA: If you don't do things you are unsure of such as \"Formatting\" a partion which will erase the whole partion. The easiest option during installation is to choose \"Install Ubuntu along side with Windows\" and you can allocate how much FREE SPACE you want to take from one drive to create one for Ubuntu.

Moreover, I checked the Launchpad page of the PPA mentioned in the tutorial and the PPA only has packages for Natty, Maverick and Lucid (which all are unsupported). Therefore, there is probably no way to get face authentication to work with that tool and I am not surprised that you get error messages in a recent Ubuntu release.\nMy advice is that you remove the tool completely from your system. The tutorial suggests that you can remove it with following commands:\ncat /etc/pam.d/gnome-screensaver | sed 's:auth sufficient pam_face_authentication\\.so enableX::g' | grep -v '^$' > temp; sudo mv temp /etc/pam.d/gnome-screensaver\ncat /etc/pam.d/gdm | sed 's:auth sufficient pam_face_authentication\\.so enableX::g' | grep -v '^$' > temp; sudo mv temp /etc/pam.d/gdm\nsudo pam-auth-update --package face_authentication\nsudo rm -f /usr/share/pam-configs/face_authentication\nsudo apt-get install ppa-purge\nsudo apt-get purge pam-face-authentication\nsudo ppa-purge ppa:antonio.chiurazzi\n\nI found one an other question on face authentication but its answers basically link to this broken tool.

When I delete the files in Desktop the files from home directory is also deleted. But I can't copy these files to home because it says file exists and whenever I press Merge button it shows some error\n\nA: As iBelieve says, you want the opposite of the solution to this question. (And it's strange that your desktop shows the contents of another folder without you having deliberately configured it to do so, but I've heard of that before.)\nSpecifically, what you should do is to open the file ~/.config/user-dirs.dirs. (~ stands for your home directory. One way to open the file is to open a Terminal window with Ctrl+Alt+T and run gedit ~/.config/user-dirs.dirs. Or you can run that command in the dash textbox or Run... dialog box raised by pressing Alt+F2.)\nWith the file open in the text editor, find the line that says:\nXDG_DESKTOP_DIR=\"$HOME\"\n\nMake it say\nXDG_DESKTOP_DIR=\"$HOME/Desktop\"\n\ninstead. Save the file, and quit the text editor. To apply this configuration change, log out and back in (or, if you prefer, reboot).\nFinally, please note that the desktop version of Ubuntu 10.04 LTS is no longer supported. It doesn't even get security updates for newly discovered vulnerabilities, so it is dangerous to use! You should upgrade to a supported version of some operating system--perhaps to Ubuntu 12.04 LTS.\nOrdinarily we would close a question about an unsupported release (and it's possible that will happen here). However, this is one relatively rare case where your quetion is similar enough to an existing question that we can know the solution applies generally, while still different enough probably not to be a duplicate.\nIf you choose to upgrade and need any help, please feel free to post a (separate) question about that.\n", "Q: how to fix spelling mistakes in the man page while reading the man page of duplicity I found some minor spelling mistakes.\nWhat is the easiest way to fix them, or have them fixed.\nPS: I'm not a programmer\n\nA: The quickest way would be to email the current maintainer listed within the man page.\nIn this case, it is Kenneth Loafman \"kenneth@loafman.com\"\nOr, you could log into Launchpad and submit a bug to the duplicity team:\n\nPersonally, I would send the report to Launchpad as this may have a better chance of hitting a wider audience and getting the desired results.

Fortunately, no Ubuntu services other than Ubuntu Forums were affected. This is according to the information page up at the Ubuntu Forums maintenance announcement page, which should be reliable since that domain is no longer controlled by the crackers who perpetrated the attack, nor by the system they compromised. Provided that you never created a separate account on Ubuntu Forums, you should be fine.\nHowever, if you did ever have an account on Ubuntu Forums, and you use the same password on Ubuntu SSO (or any other site, Ubuntu-related or not), then you should make sure to change your password and stop using that password.\n", "Q: How much ram is being used on my laptop? I have 3987MB of RAM on my laptop. Task (System) Manager says that I am using 700MB of this RAM, whilst the command \"free -m\" says I am using nearly 1500MB. Which one is correct and why do they show two different values? \nThanks for any help.\n\nA: Open the terminal (or press  Ctrl +  Alt +  T) and type top to see the real memory usage. Alternatively you can use System Monitor to see memory usage.\n\nA: Hopefully you have just booted or not worked much yet. A ubuntu system should make use of all the ram. Both are correct. The lower is how much actually used for applications and free includes cache.  \nCache is data read from your hard drive in ram. The second you need ram some of the cache will be sacrificed, but if you were to access files on your system that are in cache, the system will use that instead of slow disk access so that your machine works faster and consumes less power. \nThe output of free -m on my system:\n             total       used       free     shared    buffers     cached\nMem:          1763       1634        129          0         15        483\n-/+ buffers/cache:       1135        627\nSwap:         1019        675        343\n\nA healthy system with minimum free memory. Notice the second line -/+ buffers/cache. I'm really using 1135MB for applications and 627MB is free if I need, since the kernel can kick some of the oldest used cache easily. Since it's not as much as my home computer it does use swap as well because cache is more valuable than memory seldom accessed.

What you're referring to is the bootstrap node. At this time it isn't possible to locate the bootstrap node outside of the environment. However, you can deploy a service to the bootstrap node using the --to flag. It's not recommended, but if you know that the two won't collide, you can juju deploy --to 0 <service> to have a service shared on the bootstrap node.\n", "Q: Not able to boot Few days ago I was using windows 8 and it was pretty slow for 4gb ram and struck now and then.  Revently it became too slow but I didn't install anything so I tried to install windows 7 with the CD. \nEverything went well until every time at last when windows has to boot it just keeps blinking or says press OK to .... from CD or DVD even if I press OK nothing happens  .

It's also something I have seen already. The windows partition tables may be corrupt. Gparted may be a solution. It has the ability to rebuild partition tables, but I don't know about windows 8. If you have the windows 8 disk, i would suggest using it's repair feature. Windows 8 will reinstall itself and your data would be lost. \nLast time I saw this, the customer tried install 7 beside 8 and interrupted the install. I solved it by using the windows 8 disk to repair the damage windows 8. It erased the 7 completely. After this, I partitioned the drive out for 7 and ubuntu then installed them both in each own partition. \nGparted will not work if you have your windows 8 in fast boot mode because it hibernates the system. \n", "Q: PHP OpenSSL extension has a package?

Since then the hard drive has crashed twice. The first crash was because the laptop met the kitchen floor when I tripped over the AC cord. I upgraded to a T byte hard drive purchased at a local Depot for Office supplies and they charged an additional $100 bucks to  install Windows 7. I made a backup repair disk (14) of them and an ISO disk. I stated to get many \"x not responding\" messages and it started to run slow. It got to the point where it wouldn't  start up and to  get what I can off the hard drive before out fully crashes. I was able to replace the hard drive from the Office place under warranty, however, they wanted to charge again to replace the OS. I  said forget it Thu should put it back on for free because the hard drive crashed not because of my error.  They wouldn't so I figured screw  them  and Mi*o S*t I  want Ubuntu. How do I get it on my laptop with a blank hard drive.  Thanks for any advice.\n\nA: First, you need to download Ubuntu 13.04 32bit, or 64bit version of Ubuntu.  Once the ISO is downloaded, you can either create a bootable DVD, or USB flash drive. For creating a DVD or USB see Install Ubuntu 13.04.  You can also use UNetbootin, to create the USB.  I would recommend that you try Ubuntu before installing just to make sure that it works OK with your hardware.\nYou have tagged your question with 12.10, if that's what you want to install, then you can download it Here \nMake sure that you change your boot sequence to be able to boot from either the DVD or USB.\n\n\n\n\n", "Q: How to open files from folders using terminal command I am beginning to learn and love ubuntu.

As a bonus, you can close the terminal without killing the application.\nSince xdg-open is quite a long name, I put an alias for it in .bashrc:\nalias go='xdg-open'\n\nThis way you don't need to know what application open this file or another. xdg-open will invoke whatever software is related to the file contents or extension.\nDon't forget to give credit to Mihai Capotă for his good answer.\nGood luck!\n\nA: You fist need to ask the application to open it.

The first way is to buy the Fluendo DVD Player from Ubuntu Software Center. But there is also a free way to enable DVD playback in players like VLC and Totem.\nFirst you need to install this package (if not yet installed):\nhttps://apps.ubuntu.com/cat/applications/libdvdread4/\nThen you need to open a terminal and put the following command:\nsudo /usr/share/doc/libdvdread4/install-css.sh\n\nYou'll have to enter your password.

Hey I am a video guy and thought about switching to your OS. Does it support the Adobe Suite?\nThanks!\nJonathan \n\nA: No.\nYou can run it under wine or a Virtual Machine, but you will get better results if you use a supported OS like Windows or OS/X.\n\nA: Adobe does not support any OS except for Windows and MacOS natively. On x86 and on x86_64 you can nevertheless run many programs using a compatibility layer called WINE, which tries to substitute for the non-standard libraries shipped with Windows and which is able to read the Windows executable format. Wine Is Not an Emulator, meaning that it does not emulate a Windows PC, but simply supplies libraries that aim to have the same functionality as their proprietary Windows counterparts.\nSince WINE is a reverse engineering project, afaik completely independent from Microsoft, and is still work in progress, it is by far no complete Windows API replacement, yet meanwhile many Windows programs work nearly or as good as on Windows.\nNow, regarding your question, the WINE Appdb says that there exist some issues with Adobe Photoshop CS 6 on WINE 1.5.2. This is not up to date, since the latest WINE version is 1.6, so it might just run fine on the latest WINE, but you cannot tell without trying. For Illustrator CS 6 there are no issues reported, so it should run.

This is what I have done for Gmail:\nIn main.cf add:\nrelayhost = [smtp.gmail.com]:587\nsmtp_use_tls = yes\nsmtpd_tls_auth_only = no\nsmtp_sasl_auth_enable = yes\nsmtpd_sasl_local_domain     = $mydomain\nbroken_sasl_auth_clients = yes\nsmtp_sasl_password_maps = hash:/etc/postfix/sasl/passwd\n\nIn my case $mydomain is there because my LAN domain is the same as my Google Apps domain. You will probably need to add gmail.com or literal Google Apps domain name if that's not the case with you.\nYou also need to create a hash for the user:\n[smtp.gmail.com]:587 user@example.org:s3cr3+pA55\n\nWhere user@example.com is your FQ username, and s3cr3+pA55 is your actual password in plaintext. You place that contint in /etc/postfix/sasl/passwd and generate a hash by doing:\n$ sudo postmap /etc/postfix/sasl/passwd\n\nFinally, do note that even tho I've sent mail only to my own domain users, Google has blocked my sender username after a while and refuse to do anything about it. As it appears, automatic sending of mail (in my case server notifications) through their servers is forbidden tho it's hard to decypher that from their terms.\n\nA: It sounds like you want to setup Postfix as a \"Satellite system\" instead of an \"Internet site.\"\nsudo dpkg-reconfigure postfix\n\n\"Satellite system: All mail is sent to another machine, called a 'smarthost', for delivery.\"\ndpkg-reconfigure will walk you through the configuration and update /etc/postfix/main.cf accordingly.\nThe smarthost would be your external mail gateway. You need to make sure that is set to accept mail from this satellite system.

I'm often reading a hardcopy paper/book and taking notes on the laptop.  I like to save energy (and battery) when the laptop is just waiting for me to read.  My laptop unfortunately doesn't have a function key that blacks out the screen (which my previous laptop had, such a great idea) --not to mention that my function keys don't work with Ubuntu anyways.  \nAs simple as this is, I haven't found the optimal solution: How do I blackout the screen (or start a screensaver, that's fine, too) with a shortcut key combination?

But, if you are strongly convinced that there is no way, then please be kind enough to state that so I can go figure out how to do this with xscreensaver or whatever.\nNote that I'm not trying to lock the screen.

When using full disk encryption with Ubuntu (opposed to homedir encryption), dm-crypt with LUKS is used for encrypting the volume. In the installer (at least on 12.04 alternate) you can choose between setting it up using a passphrase or a keyfile. I'd like to use a combination of the two; not either, but require both.\nWhy? Because this enhances security (two-factor); you'll need to have something and you need to know something to unlock it. Then I want to put the keyfile on a small removable storage device (USB flash drive) and only plug it in during boot time. The result should be that it is required to put in the right flash drive and provide the right passphrase to unlock the root partition.\nSo, put in other words, I want to be asked during boot for the passphrase to which the keyfile on an external drive is encrypted.\nI see a /usr/share/initramfs-tools/hooks/cryptgnupg helper script that may help to accomplish it, but I have no clue how to use it.\nJust to avoid confusion: I am not asking for a way to add an additional key to the volume to unlock it.\n\nA: I do the same thing, however I'm afraid my answer won't be satisfactory, as for various reasons I went with a completely custom Initramfs.\nInstead of GnuPG, which is an extra binary that has to be included in the Initramfs (and in case of GnuPG-2, a rather complex one), I simply used what's already there. And that's obviously dm-crypt/LUKS.\nSo suppose you have a keyfile. Preferably one with random data.\n# dd if=/dev/urandom of=keyfile count=1\n1+0 records in\n1+0 records out\n512 bytes (512 B) copied, 0.000189802 s, 2.7 MB/s\n\nAdd encryption for it with LUKS (feel free to add your cipher settings of choice).\n# truncate -s 2M keyfile.luks\n# cryptsetup luksFormat keyfile --header keyfile.luks\n\nWARNING!\n========\nThis will overwrite data on keyfile.luks irrevocably.\n\nAre you sure? (Type uppercase yes): YES\nEnter passphrase: bananas\nVerify passphrase: bananas\n\nNow you have a keyfile (512 byte) and a keyfile.luks (2MB, which cryptsetup for some reason needs to write the 192k LUKS header). Since the Initramfs will be compressed anyway, that is not too bad (still smaller than GnuPG).\nNow you can decrypt the keyfile:\n# cryptsetup luksOpen keyfile --header keyfile.luks lukskey\nEnter passphrase for keyfile: bananas\n\nAnd you have 512 byte of random data in /dev/mapper/lukskey. (You may write to it if you want to change it, so we could have initialized the file with zeroes earlier.)\n# blockdev --getsize64 /dev/mapper/lukskey\n512\n\nIn Initramfs init you could then proceed to open the real LUKS volume with it (assuming you added the key first).\ncryptsetup --key-file=/dev/mapper/lukskey luksOpen /dev/yourdisk luksyourdisk\ncryptsetup luksClose lukskey # clean up\n\nThis approach makes GnuPG entirely superfluous, plus you get all LUKS advantages, such as multiple passphrases for the key, cipher of your choice, et cetera.

By altering where it points you can alter your timezone.\nIn order to change timezone, remove the /etc/localtime and assign symbolic link to your desired city. For instance, ls -l /etc/localtime reports that this file points to /usr/share/zoneinfo/America/Denver. To change it to New York, I do\n\n\n*\n\n*sudo rm /etc/localtime\n\n*sudo ln -s /usr/share/zoneinfo/America/New_York /etc/localtime\n\n*Wait a minute for my clock to get updated\n\n\nThe screenshot bellow shows the steps and confirmation from timedatectl\n\n\nA: The easy way to update the timezone is to use sudo dpkg-reconfigure tzdata. But this isn't so easily scripted.\nIf you want to set the timezone explicitly via a script (e.g. for setting up a VM), here's a recipe:\nSet a variable for the timezone you want, e.g. one of\ntz=Europe/London\ntz=America/Anchorage\ntz=Etc/GMT+6\n\nValid values are the directories and filenames under /usr/share/zoneinfo.\nThen simply\nsudo cp -vf /usr/share/zoneinfo/$tz /etc/localtime\necho $tz | sudo tee /etc/timezone\n\nNote that both /etc/localtime and /etc/timezone must be consistent.\nProbably now reboot to get all your services updated too (e.g. cron).\n\nA: You cannot do this unless you select the time zone file you want to correspond to each time zone offset.\nSome answers suggested using the files in /usr/share/zoneinfo/Etc, but the problem with these is that they are DST agnostic.\nSo unless you pick some time zone configuration to match each offset, or you don't care about DST, there is no way to do it generically.\n", "Q: Sending large files to clients I own a new recording studio and we have been using cloud storage like Dropbox to send large files to our clients.

I encrypted my home folder and the swap area and now when I select the first option in the boot loader the OS freezes. I tried reinstalling and encrypting on install and encrypting after install with the same effect.\nA weird pattern of squares is shown on the screen and the keyboard is unresponsive(even numlk doesn't make the LED light up). I can boot by going in recovery mode and selecting continue booting normally but the graphics driver doesn't load and I have a very annoying resolutions.\nAny suggestions?\nP.S. I am running ubuntu 13.04\n\nA: You must not encrypt your swap disk, because it does not support encrypt.\nAs you know, swap is just supporter, not the disk space you're going to put files.\n", "Q: How do I assign the output of a command to a variable? Is there a way to assign a value to a variable, that value which we get in terminal by writing any command?\nExample command: sensors\nFrom that we get CPU temperature. How can I assign this value to a temp_cpu variable?\n\nA: Yes, you use my_var=$(some_command). For example:\n$ foo=$(date)\n$ echo $foo\nMon Jul 22 18:10:24 CLT 2013\n\nOr for your specific example, using sed and grep to get at the specific data you want:\n$ cpu_temp=$(sensors acpitz-virtual-0 | grep '^temp1:' | sed 's/^temp1: *//;s/ .*//')\n$ echo $cpu_temp\n+39.0°C\n\n\nA: You can also store the value of command as follows:\nvariableName=`command`\n$variableName\n\nFor example:\ncurrentDirectory=`pwd`\n$currentDirectory\n\n", "Q: Libreoffice-templates package - how do I access them? I have installed the package libreoffice-templates via Synaptic, but when I go into LibreOffice Writer and open Template manager, there are no templates there (for Writer) - Is there something I need to do to import the templates in the package into the Template manager?\n\nA: The template files are installed to:\n/usr/lib/libreoffice/share/template/\n\nHowever, there seem to be only a handful of Impress templates, and not one Writer template.\nSource: http://packages.ubuntu.com/quantal/all/libreoffice-templates/filelist\n(You can change \"quantal\" in the above address with \"raring\" if your release is 13.04).\n", "Q: How to block updates I don't want Whenever I use Update Manager to install updates I have to painstakingly scroll through a long list of updates and uncheck all the updates I don't want, every time.  It would be nice if there was a way to simply 'dismiss' unwanted updates so that they would not continue appearing in the list.\n\nA: Terminal method\nsudo apt-mark hold <package-name>  \n\nThe same command also works for multiple package names.\nExplanation:\nhold\n    hold is used to mark a package as held back, which will prevent the\n    package from being automatically installed, upgraded or removed.\nGUI method\nIf you have a specific package that you don't want to update, you can lock the package to a specific version using the Lock Version feature of Synaptic.

A small lock emblem will appear in the green checkbox to the left of the package name to show that the package version is now locked.\n\n*Click Package -> Lock Version again to unlock the package version.\n\n\nA: It sounds like you want to disable a particular update channel. To do this, click the \"Settings\" button at the bottom left corner of the software updater, or open Software Center and go to Edit › Software Sources in the menu.\nIn the Updates tab, you can choose the specific types of updates you are interested in. To me, it sounds like you would prefer to only receive Security updates, so you can just uncheck the other ones.\n\n", "Q: How to make FN keys change brightness on Gateway m7315u? I know this not a new issue concerning brightness, however, I am anxious to get this working.

I just paid the $600 that was automatically in the \"donate\" field. How do I bump it up to include shipping?\n\nA: According to Ubuntu Edge's FAQ on the Indiegogo page, you can pay for the shipping by making another contribution and selecting the No Perk, Just a Contribution option. There is no need to contact Canonical.\n\nI contributed to a perk but I forgot to add the extra $30 for\n  shipping. How can I increase the amount?\nNo problem! If you'd like to add funds for shipping, you can make\n  another contribution and select \"No Perk, Just a Contribution.\"\n\n", "Q: What options do I have to track UbuntuEdge fundraiser progress? I guess we all are very excited about Ubuntu Edge, and hope for the best that the 32 millions will be reached.\nI would love to track the progress, but loading and refreshing the fundraiser site is distracting and not really handy.\nI am interested in different ways of tracking the money/precentage.\nI thought a screenlet desktop widget might be useful here, but I am unsure how to achieve this.\nAn indicator displaying current % would be ideal, but I guess that requires some more work.\nMaybe a simple script that displays a notification whenever a full million is reached could be easy to prepare?\n\nA: Stuart Langridge has put together a quick-and-dirty indicator to keep track of the current and projected totals for the fundraiser. He posted about it at: https://plus.google.com/108243663090085262773/posts/irW4n4abMs8\nYou can download the indicator script from http://ubuntuone.com/1g1yTcmnpDhVTB0Rp2UnbT and simply run it from the command line, or if you are on saucy (or raring with upstart user sessions) you can run it from an upstart user job:\nstart on desktop-start\nstop on desktop-end\nexec python /path/to/ubuntu-edge-indicator.py\n\nstick those lines (with the right path in the exec line of course) in ~/.config/upstart/ubuntu-edge-indicator.conf and run the first time with start ubuntu-edge-indicator. Since it's an upstart job it'll start with your session from now on (or until you remove the upstart file).\nI should note that this was the first upstart user job I defined in ~/.config/upstart so after writing the .conf file I had to log out and log in before the indicator would run from upstart.\nEDITED TO ADD:\nMy colleague Chris Wayne has packaged this indicator for precise and (I think) raring. It's available from his PPA:\nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:cwayne18/ubuntu-edge-indicator\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get install ubuntu-edge-indicator\n\n\nA: I've packaged the indicator mentioned above, to install it:\nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:cwayne18/ubuntu-edge-indicator\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get install ubuntu-edge-indicator\n`\n\n\nA: To address this specific aspect: but loading and refreshing the fundraiser site is distracting and not really handy.\nA general way to lighten websites is by blocking the loading of \"elements\" you are not interested in thereby speeding up loading of the site. By blocking certain urls on various sites, I'm able to access sites that would normally take ages to load on a slow network.\nBlocking loading can be done by means of the hosts file or by using an ad-blocking extension in your browser. I use AdBlock Plus which is available as a browser extension. The image shows the list of blockable URLs:\n\nAs an aesthetic measure which may not improve the loading time of the page, you could further block the display of elements you aren't interested in seeing by means of css. The Stylish extension available for Firefox and Chrome, allows you to create site-specific css rules to allow hiding of elements. \n", "Q: Does anybody know the name of this system monitor application? Does anybody know the name of this system monitor application?\n\n\nA: It's conky, an system monitor for clients based in the X server. You can find more information in http://conky.sourceforge.net/.\nIt also can be installed using:\nsudo apt-get install conky\n\n", "Q: two operating systems on 2 hard drives I was wondering if anyone has done this before. I was planning on installing a second hard drive in my computer and was wondering if i could install Ubuntu seperate on that drive and not the Windows 7 drive. I would think that you should be able to unplug the Win7 hard drive and just have the separate one plugged in. I dont want to partition the Win7 drive because I will probably use up the rest of the space on it in no time at all. I was wondering if anyone has any help on this.\n\nA: Well yes, indeed you can.\nIt is as easy as you mention: Simply unplug your Windows 7 Hard Disk Drive, plug the one where Ubuntu will reside and do the proper install. I would suggest you to also remove any other hard disk drive (if any) in order to prevent the GRUB Boot Loader from being installed somewhere else.\nThis process works. But you will be in the need to instruct your BIOS to boot from your main OS (if you wish auto-boot) or choose the boot drive at the startup. Certain computers allow you to do it by pressing a key then choosing the device to boot from but some of them will only let you choose if you wish to boot from DVD/HDD/USB without allowing you to choose which Hard Disk Drive is the one that you wish to boot from. Overrided by simply arranging the boot order from the BIOS.\nGood luck!\n\nA: Yes, this is quite possible, just make sure you select your second hard drive when you install Ubuntu. Easy-peasy.\n", "Q: LXDE desktop installation How do I install the LXDE desktop environment? I have it installed in Ubuntu, but cannot figure out how to install it so that it can be used.\n\nA: The LXDE page in the Ubuntu Software Center contains 5 useful add-ons for LXDE including GUI login manager for LXDE (lxdm) and Easy-Mode launcher for netbook (lxlauncher). The LXDE add-ons can be installed by putting a check mark in the checkbox to the left of each add-on and then clicking on the Install button.\nThere are many possibilities for customization in the LXDE desktop including the package used to manage the internet connection, the LXDE Panel, the Desktop wallpaper and icon fonts. Take a look at this illustrated tutorial: How to Customize the LXDE Desktop.\n\nA: On the Ubuntu Log In screen you'll see the Ubuntu icon besides (to the right of) your username and on top of the password box, click on the icon and then you'll see the different desktop environments available. Choose the one you prefer to use.\n", "Q: get the resident memory of indivdual threads of a process using bash shell If I want to find the resident memory a process uses, I might use something like \"ps aux | grep apache2\" or \"sudo pmap -d 1130\". However, I have one process that has 25 threads, and I would like to know how much resident memory (excluding the shared process memory) each of those threads are consuming, as well as showing the total number of threads for that process. I would like to do this in the bash shell. How can I do this?\n\nA: Threads share memory by definition. Therefore threads do not have individual memory and will not contribute to virtual and resident memory. It is possible to allocate memory from within a thread, but the kernel has no information about what memory is allocated for which thread, and so it is impossible to query for this from outside the process.\n", "Q: Ubuntu 12.04 eat a lot of internet bandwidth I don't know when this problem start to happen, but whenever I use Ubuntu on my computer, my whole house network is down. But when I switch back to windows, the whole house network is back again. Is there a problem with Ubuntu or just that my computer is eating a lot of bandwidth? Please help. Thank you\n\nA: There isn't anything special in Ubuntu that eats bandwidth, at least not to that should cause the \"whole house network is down\".\nLet's assume \"whole house network is down\" actually means \"all the other computers can't get on the internet\". This can be caused by a lot of things, and debugging is necessary. First I would confirm that it is indeed your computer that eats all the bandwidth. You could do this with nload:\nOpen a terminal(Ctrl-Alt-T or by menu) and install nload:\nsudo apt-get install nload\n\nOpen nload:\nnload\n\nYou could cycle through you interfaces(wifi, ethernet, etc) with arrow keys.\nIf it indeed is your computer eating bandwidth, you should check if it's inbound or outbound. Inbound could mean that an update is downloading, but a lot of outbound traffic is usually bad if your not uploading anything.\n", "Q: Can't install ubuntu. I tried installing 13.04 as a dual boot. I get the \"Use the Live CD to install!\" thing. Not having a live cd, I try to use a live usb. All my efforts so far seem for naught.\nI did this, http://www.ubuntu.com/download/desktop/create-a-usb-stick-on-windows\nThen I set my bootup sequence to use the usb first.\nWhich to me, means I ought to be able to start up and install Ubuntu, right?\nThe result is the computer skips right past the usb and just loads windows7.\nAm I missing something here? I must be. \n\nA: I formatted my usb to exFat and started with the Pendrive universal installer.  I got a small error message saying the installation would not be bootable. Is it possible you did as well and missed the error message?\nI went back and let the universal installer format the usb stick to Fat32 for me and it now works fine.  \n", "Q: Ubuntu Server several network ip config? I have one ubuntu server\nand i want config that with several IP address!\nis it possible or no? \nif yes how I can do that?\n\nA: copy your ifcfg-eth0 file to ifcfg-eth0:1 then ifcfg-eth0:2 etc, and change the device name to match eth0:1, and eth0:2 etc\nAlso change the ip address and other details.  Then restart your network service.\nNote that you cannot have multiple default gateways like this.\n", "Q: sudo apt-get crashed during hbase installation I had problem regarding hbase installation and end up in a buggy \"sudo apt-get\" now.

Device [11ab:2a08] is Gateway 6750.\nAs I have read this device needs NDISwrapper, which is a free software driver wrapper that enables the use of Windows XP network device drivers (for devices such as PCI cards, USB modems, and routers) on Linux operating systems.\nMake sure you have ndiswrapper, and if you get \"ndiswrapper not found\", follow this link. There is also a graphical interface for ndiswrapper that you can use called ndisgtk.\nNow that you have NDISWrapper installed and working, You should already have the Windows driver extracted into a folder and that you are running these commands from that folder.\nsudo ndiswrapper -i NetMW14x.inf\nsudo ndiswrapper -a 11ab:2a08 netmw14x\nsudo ndiswrapper -l\nsudo ndiswrapper -m\nsudo depmod -a\nsudo modprobe ndiswrapper\n\nPay attention as you follow, the second command parameter should be the same number as your lspci result.\nWith -l you would check which driver is newly installed. and -m saves your configuration.\nLinux  kernel  modules  can  provide  symbols for other modules to use.\ndepmod  creates a list of module dependencies by reading each module under /lib/modules/version and determining what symbols it exports and what symbols it needs.\nmodprobe utility is used to add loadable modules to the Linux kernel. You can check how the process have been so far by viewing dmesg command result. Especially when you run the last command.\nNow that you have your wireless card enabled; Check to see if you network configuration is OK,\n\n\n*\n\n*wireless is shown among your network interfaces, (along with your lan connection),\n(report back commands: iwconfig, ifconfig, nm-tool, lshw -C network)\n\n*You can scan your wireless network, and see available networks,\n\n*Your AP has given your interface correct settings (it has IP address and this address is not the same range as your LAN)\n\n*you can ping your AP,\n\n*you can browse the net.\n\n", "Q: Mounting drives using keyboard shortcut Recently, I learned that we can assign and access specific folders using keyboard shortcut.  For example, to access my Downloads folder, I have assigned the command:\nnautilus Downloads/\nand a keyboard shortcut Alt+D to access the Downloads folder.\nSimilarly, is it possible to assign keyboard shortcut to access folders located within unmounted drives?\nFor instance, I have a folder named \"TTC Video High School Basic Math (compressed)\"  located in /media/87daf597-b5fc-45e9-b961-30895d500bcc\nbut using \nnautilus media/87daf597-b5fc-45e9-b961-30895d500bcc/\nI am unable to mount the partition.\n\nA: I think there are not supposed to be any keyboard shortcut (in my opinion, so just ignore this).\nAbout mounting, go on nautilus and click on a drive, or mount /dev/sd(a,b,c or etc) destination-folder should work too.\n", "Q: Installing ubuntu (DUAL BOOT) I HAVE ALREADY INSTALLED WINDOWS 8 AND WINDOWS XP ON MY c: AND d: DRIVES OF 50 GB EACH RESPECTIVELY.

It is not supported by Windows, so in Windows it is shown as RAW.\n", "Q: Wacom Tablet in 13.04 I've been scanning the forums looking for a straight answer. I'm planning on buying a Wacom Intuos5 large for graphic design and art work but would like to know if Ubuntu has enough decent support for me to get full functionality out of my tablet. I wouldn't mind doing some heavy programming to get things working right, but as long as it is possible, and as long as there are enough resources for me to search through since I know 0 C(programming) or any other programming language for that matter, beyond PHP. \nSo, will my Tablet work perfectly in Ubuntu? or will I have to dual-boot? (really don't want to dual boot) \n\nA: Try this page: http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=2139480&page=2\n...it's a tad tecchy, but it boils down to the following:\nsudo apt-get install xutils-dev libudev-dev\ngit clone git://git.code.sf.net/p/linuxwacom/xf86-input-wacom\ncd xf86-input-wacom\n./autogen.sh --prefix=/usr --libdir=/usr/lib\nmake\nsudo make install\n\nIf you get these errors when you try the above:\nNo package 'xorg-server' found No package 'randrproto' found\n\n....then do the following:\nsudo apt-get install libx11-dev libxi-dev x11proto-input-dev xserver-xorg-dev tk8.4-dev tcl8.4-dev libncurses5-dev libx11-dev libxi-dev libxrandr-dev libxinerama-dev \n\n& then go back into the xf86-input-wacom directory & re-do the \n./autogen.sh --prefix=/usr --libdir=/usr/lib\n\ncommand.\nFollowed by:\nmake\nsudo make install\n\n...and you should be all set to use your lovely Wacom tablet on Ubuntu 13.04\nI've just done the above on a 64-bit machine with no problems (& the above will work on a 32 bit machine too).\nCheers,\nDez.\n\nA: My sister has one (dont know the models name) and she told me, when she came to visit me, that I couldnt use it on my computer, because I needed a special software to install first (she didnt bring the CD).

To my understanding, creating a revocation certificate for the PGP key is important for a couple of reasons.\nI don't see any way of creating the revocation certificate in Ubuntu. I would appreciate some direction with this issue.\n\nA: If you're fine with using the command line, this is easily done using gpg --gen-revoke.\nThe revocation certificate is stored in revoke.asc (in your home directory if you do not change anything else) and you should replace mykey by your key id.\ngpg --output revoke.asc --gen-revoke mykey\n\nRemember to store it in a save place, for example by printing it to a QR code or something similar.\n", "Q: How to know if Squid Proxy is doing the Cache correctly I wanted to test if the Clients attached to a Squid Server are actually using the Cache data instead of going directly to the internet and retrieving the data. I have configured all clients browsers to read the Server:Port from the Squid Server (Which is 10.42.0.1:3128). So how do I know if they are retrieving the information from the Cache or the Internet.\nI asked since a quick \"test\" gave me the same speed when loading several pages that had many images on them. Same images and not ads that change on every visit.\nWhat ways can I use to check if they are using the Cache?\nI ran the following: sudo tail -f /var/log/squid3/access.log and got several lines that kept on scrolling:\n1374553166.136    929 185.168.101.131 TCP_MISS/200 28198 GET http://www.amazon.de/gp/offer-listing/B000NOIW62/ref=sr_1_1_olp? - DIRECT/178.236.7.219 text/html\n\nThey had a TCP_MISS/200 and at the end had a DIRECT as the example above. This happened while I had all computers in the LAN turned off. When I tried to used one I got the following doing a sudo tail -f /var/log/squid3/access.log | grep HIT\n1374553387.488      0 10.42.0.14 TCP_IMS_HIT/304 278 GET http://g-ecx.images-amazon.com/images/G/01/da/creatives/sn130.png - NONE/- image/png\n\nSo it shows as TCP_IMS_HIT/304 and at the end it shows a NONE\nSo what does the TCP_MISS, DIRECT, TCP_IMS_HIT and NONE mean?\nIs the cache working?\n\nA: in a terminal, on the server running squid, run the command\ntail -f /var/log/squid3/access.log\n\nthen watch it as a user visits web pages.  If lots of lines scroll up the screen whenever they click on something then they are using the proxy server.  If the squid log file is not located there have a look in /etc/squid for the location of the log file.\nTo quit out of the above command press ctrl+c\nTo see if it is actually caching stuff and being useful there should be some lines that say it is a HIT.  To see a full description of the log file contents see the squid wiki. Note that cache HITs will not be as frequent as you'd like due to an individual user's web browser already caching stuff locally.  You will get the most hits when multiple users request the same pages before that info is dropped from the cache.\nSuch as when an allstaff email goes out saying \"check this site out...\"\n\n\n*\n\n*TCP_MISS/200 means that the requested document was not in the cache but it could fetch it OK from the web server.  The direct at the end says that the file was fetched from the webserver.\n\n*TCP_IMS_HIT/304 means that the client asked if the file has changed, and squid checked its date/time on the webserver and found it had not changed, so it gave a copy of the file to the client out of its local cache.\n\n\nSo yes your squid is being used and is working as a cache.\n", "Q: Where does unity keep information on the launchers in dash?

I accidently executed sudo apt-get remove --purge gstreamer0.10, and the packages such as gimp, gnome-, Rhythmbox and etc are removed, so I forced to stop the processing, but I don't remember what packages were deleted. How can I reinstall the packages?\n\nA: \nI forced to stop the processing\n\nIf you mean that you halted the package manager during its work, this is a bad idea.  Much better to just let it do what it's doing, then reverse it later.\nIf apt-get now refuses to work because a previous operation was interrupted, you can try dpkg --configure -a and apt-get install -f to try and fix the problem.  But it's not guaranteed to work.\n\nI don't remember what packages were deleted\n\nYou can have a look at the DPKG log as described in this question.  It points out that the DPKG log is at: /var/log/dpkg.log and it should show the packages that were installed or removed.\nIn general however, I believe that installing the metapackage ubuntu-desktop should restore any missing packages that normally come with an Ubuntu desktop install.\nsudo apt-get install ubuntu-desktop\n\nIf you need to individually install all the separate packages, it may mark some dependencies as \"manually installed\" which can leave around extra cruft during future upgrades.\n", "Q: Bluetooth mouse not functioning So I am using Ubuntu 12.04 and I have a generic brand mouse and a generic brand USB bluetooth module. my issue is that I can't quite use the mouse.

I just ran into an OS issue, and I was thinking of simply doing a reinstall of Ubuntu. I was looking at the Ubuntu installation options, and I saw that I could \"Reinstall Ubuntu 13.04\". \"Documents, music..... Installed software will be kept where possible. System-wide settings will be cleared.\"\nOriginally, I was using this linuxbox for a Wordpress installation, it had the LAMP stack installed. Will MySQL and PHP be kept? Also, will I be able to reinstall without damaging/wiping out the database for Wordpress? Those are the two biggest concerns on my mind right now, and as a Linux noob, I'm really hoping I don't lose those two.\n\nA: Your databases will be lost if you reinstall Ubuntu.\nIf you want to have a .sql file that you can directly import into any system, you can do the following command: mysqldump -u root -p --all-databases > ~/mysql-backup.sql.  It will prompt you for the MySQL root (administrative) user password, then dump all the SQL data into the file at /home/USER/mysql-backup.sql (where USER is the user you've logged into)\nThat file, then, can be used to restore all your database data, so make sure you download it somewhere other than your server.  Then, upload that file to the new server in your home directorywhen you want to restore the data, do: mysql -u root -p < ~/mysql-backup.sql\nThat will restore all your database data and your files.\nRemember to back up your website data if the databases are part of a website, and also remember to back up (or download to a place on your computer but not at wherever you're reinstalling) any data you want to keep, as well.\n\nA: All files and directories in /var/www will be deleted when you reinstall Ubuntu, so you better create a back up of all necessary files, not forgetting your databases if you have one.\n", "Q: Darcula dark theme for Eclipse I wonder if there is a way to use Android Studio Darcula theme in Eclipse?

Thanks!\n\nA: The guide you use, is outdated. I'd suggest to follow the official installation manual instead.\nAnother Remark: Check first if your mainboard uses UEFI or BIOS. If it uses UEFI, then you have to make sure that you install both, Windows and Ubuntu using the same firmware interface (meaning: both in UEFI mode, or both in BIOS emulation mode). Also, in this case, use the 64bit Version of Ubuntu, since the 32bit one will not dual boot, except if you use BIOS emulation for both, Windows and Ubutnu. If you run into troubles, read the Ubuntu UEFI Guide.\n\nA: Steps mentioned in the link you have mentioned are good enough ..\nAs far as the choice of Ubuntu version is concerned:\nI have Ubuntu Raring Ringtail 13.04 x64 on dual boot system with Windows 7 Home Premium x64 and I am quite happy with it ..\nBut I would recommend 12.04 32-bit for you simply because it is more easy to use and it can run more applications with much much less hastle .. plus it is the recommended version :)\n\nA: You should install Ubuntu 12.04 LTS, that is latest stable version.\nIf you don't have UEFI, just execute WUBI and it will do your work.\nIf you have UEFI, burn iso into your USB drive and boot it.\nWhen you successfully entered it, follow the instructions.\n", "Q: FTPS client, preferably integrated in Nautilus? I like Nautilus for FTP/WebDAV, but how to use it with an FTPS server?\nWhen I enter ftps:// Nautilus says Don't recognize this file server type.\nIs there any plugin?\nOr something as quick and convenient as Nautilus, with FTPS support?\ngFTP from Ubuntu's repo says FTPS Support unavailable since SSL support was not compiled in.\n\nNote from Wikipedia: FTPS should not be confused with the SSH File Transfer Protocol (SFTP), an incompatible secure file transfer subsystem for the Secure Shell (SSH) protocol. It is also different from Secure FTP, the practice of tunneling FTP through an SSH connection.\n\nA: Update:\nNautilus supports FTPS now that the bug linked below has (finally) been fixed (Thanks @HullCityFan852).\nOriginal post:\nNautilus does not support FTPS, see that bug (opened a long time ago but still no progress)\nAs an alternative, you can use FileZilla:\n\nFileZilla client supports FTPS both implicit (FTPS:// protocol), and\n  explicit (FTPES://).\n\nSource\n\nA: Old discussion but maybe current still. It seems Nautilus does not do implicit tls but only explicit. Meaning with url like ftps://host, it will start with clear ftp port 21 and try to AUTH TLS which, to my understanding, is explicit. Eg. Citrix Sharefile does not support explicit, but supports implicit and thus can not be used with Nautilus.\nIf Nautilus is meant to to do only explicit, should't it require ftpes scheme?\n", "Q: NVIDIA drivers don't work with GTX 780 I was using GTX 560 with nvidia's drivers in Ubuntu without problem.

I just feel that writing xorg.conf in 2013 is not a right thing to do. Am I wrong?\nSure, I can just download NVIDIA drivers from their site, install drivers from binary, create xorg.conf file and be entitled to manual reinstallation of it with every kernel update. May be somebody can tell me a less awkward solution?\n\nA: I have installed CCSM, and toggled OpenGL plugin  off and on there. Then did it with unity plugin. It helped. \nThe error seems to be reproducible on several PC, including fresh install of Ubuntu. Video card version does not matter, though. \n", "Q: How can I create a custom installation disk? Ubuntu and Kubuntu don't come with additional applications such as Java, WINE, Dictionary etc.\nI know that can download these applications from the Software Center, but it costs time and money. Internet isn't free and not everyone has access to high speed internet. Also, the Software Center's server is often busy and we cannot download with high speed and sometimes there are errors.\nSo, once I've gone to the trouble of installing all the programs I want in Kubuntu, how can I create an installation DVD to use it in the future when I want to reinstall it? I want to save time and cost to avoid re-downloading software from internet and give this installation disk to my friends.\n\nA: There are a few reasons for a JAVA and WINE not being available by default in Ubuntu CD. First, for java, there is always an option for users to choose between OpenJDK and Sun's JDK.\nA difference is presented in the following website:\nhttps://stackoverflow.com/questions/1977238/why-should-i-use-the-oracle-jdk-over-the-openjdk-or-vice-versa\nRegarding WINE, Wine is particularly for those willing to run windows program on their ubuntu flavors. While many use it for games, others are just happy with the fact that ubuntu is the only OS booting their machine and might never use WINE. Alot of alternative applications like GIMP, Audacity, OpenShot, would happily replace Adobe Photoshop and other popular applications in windows.\nNext, there is a stuff called AptOnCD available in following link:\nhttp://aptoncd.sourceforge.net/\nonce you have the software, you can easily create a backup of your current installations and use it for future. You can use the following link of a How-to on aptonCD:\nhttp://www.howtogeek.com/110034/how-to-back-up-restore-your-installed-ubuntu-packages-with-aptoncd/\nI would suggest you go for Ubuntu Studio: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ubuntu_Studio#Software_included\nwhich comes with a lots of softwares regarding audio, video and other stuffs.\nYou can download it from its official website: http://ubuntustudio.org/\nHowever, the stuffs packed in nearly 700 Mib of our lovely Ubuntu CD doesn't need any dependency on JAVA and WINE for their installation.\nHope this helps.\nRegards, WinuxUser\n", "Q: Network Problem : Cannot connect to a ping-able website with Firefox For some reason I need to configure my computer using static IP settings to let other computers to find it.

So I tried to ping www.facebook.com and I get:\nping: unknown host www.facebook.com\n\nThis might be a problem with the DNS server, so I used another computer to nslookup www.facebook.com and get the IP 31.13.68.8. Therefore I tried to ping 31.13.68.8 and it can ping this IP correctly.\nSo I try to connect to Facebook with Firefox directly using the address 31.13.68.8. Strangely, it will automatically change the address to www.facebook.com but still can't show the page. Does that mean the DNS server works?\nThe last step I tried is to ssh 192.168.2.100 to this computer and it works. I can log in to the computer and control it. I guess that means the IP setting is correct?\nI can't figure out what the problem is and how to solve it. Thanks for any advice!\n\nA: First of all, it is dns-nameservers not nameserver. Second, since this is a wireless interface, you'll need to declare the SSID you want to connect to and supply the password.

However when I tried to install wine1.6-i386, it asked for a lot of other i386 packages like libgstreamer0.10-0:i386. I was not able to install it and didn't know how to solve such dependencies. Any help will be appreciated.\n\nA: I found the answer... at least a solution.\nCan't install wine (or ia32-libs) in Ubuntu 12.10 64 bit\nUsing /etc/apt/preferences to assign Pin-Priority would solve the dependencies problems while installing wine-i386.  However, in some of my machines it would remove almost all kde packages and I need to re-install them back after installing i386 packages.\n\nA: Just add additional architecture:\nsudo dpkg --add-architecture i386\n\nupdate your apt sources and it should work.\nExample (as root):\ndpkg --add-architecture i386 # Add i386 architecture for Wine\nadd-apt-repository -y ppa:ubuntu-wine/ppa  # Add PPA/Wine repository\napt-get update\napt-get install -qy wine1.8\n\nSee also: Can't install wine (or ia32-libs) in Ubuntu 12.10 64 bit\n\nA: The wine1.x metapackage depends on both wine1.x-amd64 and wine1.x-i386 actual packages. These correspond to support for amd64 and i386 windows applications. 64 bit systems can still run 32 bit binaries providing they have 32 bit versions of all the necessary libraries.\nYou can install only the wine1.x-amd64 package to avoid the multiarch dependency, but you will then not be able to load 32-bit windows applications, which still seems to cover a significant fraction of games and applications.\nI'm not sure about the dependency problems, but I would look for general fixing broken package answers rather than anything wine-specific.\n", "Q: why is my second monitor stuck on 4:3

\n\nA: It was the monitor cable.\nA new 5 metre monitor cable failed!\nWhen I reverted to a 2  metre cable it worked well.\n\nA: Just for the hell of it.\nA VGA cable carries an analog signal, and the maximum length decreases as the resolution increases.  So, 1024x768 can run effectively over a 9 meter cable, but 1600x1200@60Hz won't work good past 1 meter.\nYour options are to use repeaters (which is not feasible), or use DVI instead. Since it's digital it can carry the signal longer, even with high resolutions, up to 9 meters.\n\nA: In the same vein as solution provided by @simplysimon and explained by @mitch, I encountered a similar problem with a similar bizarre solution.\nI have been using a Viewsonic VA1918wm as a secondary monitor plugged via a VGA port, along with a primary monitor using a HDMI port, for some time and which has an optimum resolution of 1440x900. The OS installed is Ubuntu 14.04.1. A couple of days back, on reboot, the monitor resolution dropped and the All Settings > Displays option for the secondary monitor showed only two lower resolutions as options - 1024x768(4:3) and 800x600(4:3) - in Resolution dropdown. To resolve this, I tried a solution suggested for a similar problem using the Mirror displays checkbox in Displays settings, but to no avail.\nAfter reading the post by @mitch above, I tried a hardware trick of \n\n\n*\n\n*Having both monitors switched on and displaying Desktop screen\n\n*Remove the HDMI cable and wait few seconds. This caused displays to momentarily black-out, but Desktop resumed display on only the secondary monitor\n\n*Put the HDMI cable back. This caused the display to resume on both monitors\n\n\nand voila! The Viewsonic monitor was back to its optimum resolution, and Resolution in Displays settings showed a larger list of options, including 1440x900(16:10)\n", "Q: Installing Ogre3D in Ubuntu 13.04 x64? I'm using code::blocks. I'm a C++ developer, and I need Ogre3D for a project I'm working on. I've heard of Ogre before, and the demo applications are impressive, so I have decided to use it. THe problem is, I can't install it. The Linux downloads page is a mix-mash of different tutorials that don't work or return \"file not found\" errors. I'm confused beyond belief as to how I actually set the thing up - the SDK is refusing to install despite installing libogre-dev with apt.\nPlease, please can someone make clear what I'm actually meant to do? I've been searching the web and trying different things for 48 hours now, and have got nowhere. I can't even compile the example application, it says \"Exampleapplication.h: file or directory not found\" when compiling with code::blocks.\n\nA: You can find Ogre3D 1.9 in OpenMW launchpad PPA.

I noticed that ubuntu hasn't mentioned this anywhere.  Will the phone be available after it's backed by indiegogo and everyone who backed it gets theirs?

I recently dual-booted my ASUS X55C running Windows 8 With Ubuntu 12.04LTS and encountered several problems along the way and resolved them. \nThe first thing I learned was in order to boot into linux you'll need to go into your BIOS, which since you've dual-booted I'd assume you already know how to do so. I'd imagine it's a bit different on XP, but if you don't know how to then turn off your PC and on boot up you'll either need to press F2, f5, f10, SHIFT, DELETE. Or whatever other keys that could boot BIOS, it depends on your computer those are the most common ones, mine was DELETE, you could google your computers specific one and if you can't find anything it's trial and error. Sometimes it tells you what to press on boot up.\nWhen you find out which it is, on boot up immediately keep pressing that key until the BIOS show up. They'll look something like this:\nhttp://blogdotinsanegenius.files.wordpress.com/2012/07/bios-beta_.jpg\nNow you're going to want to find your secure boot option and disable it if it is not already disabled, Ubuntu needs it disabled in order to run. \nNow find the BOOT options tab, and locate BOOT OVERRIDE. If it's not in BOOT options it could be under SAVE&EXIT like it is on Windows 8. In BOOT you can also change which is default so you don't have to override. Under BOOT OVERRIDE you should see your Windows XP and Ubuntu partitions, to boot into XP highlight it and press enter, to boot into GRUB highlight the Ubuntu one and press enter.\nIf successful when you select the Ubuntu option, your GRUB should appear. From GRUB you should be able to select Ubuntu and boot in normally. \nFor me GRUB displayed both my Ubuntu and Ubuntu Recovery options as well as the same two for Windows 8. \nThe problem I had is that you can't boot into windows 8 from GRUB due to the invalid EFI shell. So everytime you wish to switch OS's you have to go through your BIOS.\nNow with XP you may not have this issue, I don't know what XP's boot requirements are. For Windows 8 you have to activate CSM mode and use boot repair in linux, and then when your computer boots it will automatically boot into GRUB and you have a new UEFI windows option in GRUB so you can easily switch OS's\nIn order to do that follow the instructions on the answer here:\nDualbooting Windows 8 and Ubuntu 12.04?\nThere may be other boot managers for XP, so you could do some research there.\nOtherwise, you'll have to go through your BIOS on every boot up to switch OS's.\nI hope that helped some, I know this is more of a help for Windows 8, but I think some if not most of this will apply to XP.\n\nA: XP will not work from gpt partitions. And with BIOS XP needs special drivers to work with AHCI which are not normally included.\nI dual booted Ubuntu with 10.10 installed on a gpt drive and chain loaded from grub to a install of XP in another drive that was MBR(msdos). But XP does not have any drivers to even see a NTFS data partition on a gpt partitioned drive.\nWhen I got my SSD, I turned on AHCI, so trim would work, and XP stopped working. I was able to turn AHCI back off and boot XP, but that is such a hassle that I finally stopped using XP. There are drivers for AHCI, but the install process after XP is installed is rather complex.\n\nA: OK, this is how it works. I have just done it.\n\n\n*\n\n*Install the XP and choose to partition the HD and format the partition. \nif you had anything on the HD then I suggest to delete all partitions and then create partition.

Its detecting all the networks available, allowing me to type in the password but not enabling \"Connect\" button. Looking forward for any useful suggestion.\n\nA: If the connect button is greyed out, your passphrase does not match the expected encryption standard.\nFor instance: WPA/2 passworts need to be between 8 and 64 Characters. If you have less characters in your passphrase, the connection Button will not activate.\nIt may happen that ubuntu does not correctly recognize your routers encryption. In this rare case you should edit your connections security to what your router is set to under Connections -> Wireless -> edit \"Your connection\" -> Security \n\nA: You might want to check the permissions in the .config for your local user:\nchmod -R ug+rw /home/youruser/.config\nwhich will give read and write permissions for user and group in your settings directory.

I have currently installed Apache on my 12.04 32-bit Ubuntu server, but I'm interested into switching to Nginx. I have read a number of comparisons and reviews, where Nginx is faster than Apache serving static content, but these don't cover PHP performance.\nHere is my question: How does Nginx compare to Apache regarding performance of PHP processing? Is Nginx also faster for PHP?\n\nA: Nginx with PHP-FPM is generally faster than Apache with mod_php, but the resulting performance improvement depends on the environment (PHP code complexity, users/load, hardware, etc.), where you deploy your solution or web application.\nWe need to dig a bit deeper into webservers to understand why there are no plain comparisons of PHP performance for webservers.\nPHP support in Nginx\nApache uses mod_php to interpret PHP code. Lighttpd, a competitor to Nginx during the early days, used its own spawn_fcgi (another FastCGI implementation) to improve speed and resulted in being able to serve more users with the same or less amount of resources as Apache. Thus gaining popularity.\nNginx is a bit more different to Lighttpd. As of today Nginx supports a lot of functionality and can also be configured to run spawn_fcgi, but it was never as closely bundled with it as was Lighttpd. Which allowed to re-think about PHP support for webservers and probably led to the FastCGI Process Manager project (PHP-FPM).\nPHP-FPM is available in Ubuntu via the php-fpm package as of 12.04. The Ubuntu package comes pre-configured, but it's worth reading up on how to fine tune pool parameters for your needs (impatcs: complexity of code, available RAM and CPU processing power, execution time). There are also guides available which explain how to setup dedicated pools for different applications yielding for not only more performance, but also security. If you care about performance you should take the time to get to know the main components of your new server stack.\nConfiguring Nginx\nPlease read the Nginx documentation in the english project wiki. I found it to be very helpful for understanding how Apache is configured, why Nginx does things differently (e.g. if is evil) and how you achieve speed improvements with Nginx.\nIf you replace Apache with Nginx and try to configure it the same way as Apache, you won't get much speed improvement at all or your configuration will just not work.\nNginx basically aims for reducing complexity while still providing a wide feature set. \nAnd who said you cannot run an Apache behind Nginx?\n\nA: Usually it is said, that nginx is faster, when there are lots of static content, and the number of user requests is high. If you have a small website, it is really up to your preference to select your web server. But to answer the question itself, the difference in PHP processing itself should be negligible.\n\nA: Here is a comparison between Apache and Nginx listing some advantages and disadvantages.\nApache, by contrast, approaches large numbers of requests by spinning off more processes to handle them, typically consuming a lot of RAM as it does so.  And sometimes Apache gets a little anxious about the size of its repast. Apache is available from the Ubuntu package repositories with a quick sudo apt-get install apache2.\n\n\n*\n\n*Apache, is the most established web server today and powers more\nsites on the web than any other server.\n\n*Apache is an established, flexible web server that many\nenterprise-level customers rely on for delivering both dynamic and\nstatic content.\n\n*Apache can run on a range of operating systems, is well-maintained,\nand its ubiquity means that a substantial amount of user-generated\ndocumentation exists.\n\n*Apache consumes more memory under high server loads, which can result\nin degraded performance.\n\n*Due to how robust it is, Apache also comes size, which leads to more\nmemory consumption.\n\n\nNginx (pronounced \"engine-ex\") is a lightweight Web server with a reputation for speed, speed, speed. It differs from Apache in a fundamental way—Apache is a process- and thread-driven application, but Nginx is event-driven. The practical effect of this design difference is that a small number of Nginx \"worker\" processes can plow through enormous stacks of requests without waiting on each other and without synchronizing; they just \"close their eyes\" and eat the proverbial elephant as fast as they can, one bite at a time.\n\n\n*\n\n*Nginx is designed to be simple and lightweight, and to require fewer\nhardware resources than other web servers. It does this in part by\nusing an event-based processing model, which generally requires less\nmemory than a process-based server uses.\n\n*Nginx is fast at serving static web pages.\n\n*Nginx is newer, there is less documentation and support for it\ncompared to more established web servers.\n\n*The lightweight design also means that it can be more difficult to\ncustomize, which might be necessary for large or complex\nconfigurations.\n\n\nThe difference is summed up succinctly in a quote by Chris Lea on the Why Use Nginx? page: \"Apache is like Microsoft Word, it has a million options but you only need six. Nginx does those six things, and it does five of them 50 times faster than Apache.\"\nWhen you compare Nginx vs. Apache, both are open source software, and both camps have a community of vocal advocates.  Nginx is available from the Ubuntu package repositories with a quick sudo apt-get install Nginx.\nIn the end, both Nginx and Apache web servers are solid solutions although each has their fortes in given situations. Nginx’s main strengths include serving up static web pages quickly, and light consumption of memory and hardware resources. Apache is the established and versatile workhorse, with abundant module availability and documentation. Depending on your business needs and technical requirements, one or the other, or even a combination of the two, may be right for you.\nHope that this helps.\nSource:Lee Hutchinson & Lukasz Kujawa\n\nA: You can use nginx , it is very fast vs Apache2 with bot static and dynamic and response time also quick then other. \nIt also work fine with php , rails and other scripting language.\n", "Q: run levels only at start up I find the concept of runlevels very confusing. Currently, I'm trying to run a script only at start up. But configuring as shown below leads to it working also at halt time.\nI'm programming a daemon this way:\nupdate.rc-d script.sh defaults 100\n\nAlso I have tried\nupdate-rc-d script.sh start 100\n\nBut that does not work either.\n\nA: Runlevels are logical groups of tasks. Traditionally you have five run levels.\n0 boot\n1 single user \n2 not used\n3 multiuser\n4 not used \n5 gui\n6 reboot \n\nEach runlevel defines a more or less static set of tasks to run. Runlevel 1, may not have networking while runlevel 3 may not have the GUI login screen. A system goes through all lower runlevels before it reaches the default runlevel. For a typical Ubuntu box, the traditional runlevel is 5: GUI, while other distros such as Debian or Gentoo may come configured to run 3: multiuser as the default runlevel. \nIn recent versions of ubuntu, this model has changed somewhat because the previous way of starting the system did not allow for multiple services (programs) to run in parallel. Without doubt, there were other reasons as well.\n\nIf I understand your objective correctly, you need to run a single command. You can do that by putting it along with any other commands you might have in the /etc/rc.local file: \n$ chmod 755 /etc/rc.local \n\nThe Init system will not run this file without execution bits\n$ cat /etc/rc.local\n#!/bin/sh -e\n# This script is executed at the end of each multiuser runlevel.\n\nloadkeys  /root/jolemak.iso15.kmap\nexit 0\n\nAny multiuser runlevel means any runlevel above 3. In this example, a single command is run to load an alternative keyboard layout for the virtual consoles. It serves as a quick way to fix the layout before I figure out how to properly install and configure additional layouts.\n\nIf you need to do more advanced stuff, either write a traditional /etc/init.d/foo script or a new upstart (Ubuntu-specific) /etc/init/moo.conf. Study the examples in that folder and read the wiki for more info. \nhttps://help.ubuntu.com/community/UbuntuBootupHowto \nhttp://upstart.ubuntu.com/getting-started.html \nhttp://upstart.ubuntu.com/cookbook/ \nYour question is also answered here: http://upstart.ubuntu.com/cookbook/#single-job and here http://www.debuntu.org/how-to-managing-services-with-update-rc-d/\n\nA: http://www.netbsd.org/docs/guide/en/chap-rc.html#chap-rc-scripts documents how your script should work. Your script is going to be run at startup AND at shutdown AND any time a user runs \"service yourscriptname\". You need to tell your script to check its first and only parameter. If that parameter is \"start\" then start your service or do whatever else your script does. If that parameter is \"stop\" then stop your service or do nothing. How you handle \"restart\" and \"status\" is up to you. Right now your script is ignoring that parameter, so when \"script.sh start\" gets called on startup all is well, but when \"script.sh stop\" gets called on halt the whole thing runs again.\n", "Q: Software Updater problem in 12.10 This is the error I'm getting:\nW:GPG error: http://ppa.launchpad.net quantal Release: The following signatures couldn't be verified because the public key is not available: NO_PUBKEY D1106511179518B2, \nW:Failed to fetch gzip:/var/lib/apt/lists/partial/archive.ubuntu.com_ubuntu_dists_quantal_main_source_Sources\n Hash Sum mismatch\nW:Failed to fetch gzip:/var/lib/apt/lists/partial/ppa.launchpad.net_mozillateam_firefox-next_ubuntu_dists_quantal_main_binary-i386_Packages\n Hash Sum mismatch\nE:Some index files failed to download.

The folder mounts at start up but its empty(It also has a padlock sign.). I have to run the command  below to access its content(the padlock sign disappears).\n  sudo mount.vboxsf media ~/media\n\nHow can i configure it to be run automatically at start up. I've tried adding to the start up programs but nothing happens. \n Am new to Linux so try to put your answer in a layman's language.\nThanks.\n\nA: So here is how to access your shared folders on Ubuntu VM(Oracle Virtualbox). Am assuming you have already enabled auto-mount while you were adding the folder.\nOpen the terminal and type.\nsudo usermod -G vboxsf -a $USER\n\nThis command appends the current user to the vboxsf group, which is the owner of the shared folders (found in /media/ on the Ubuntu box). Confirm from your media folder if the shared folders are present. They're usually named \"sf_name-of-shared-folder\".\nFor quick access, you may want to create a link to the shared folders in the home folder.\nIn Terminal (assuming that you are in the directory where you want the link to appear and that you've enabled the Nautilus plugin that gives you the context menu option ) do:\nln -s /media/sf_shared/ name_of_link.\n\nReplace sf_shared with the actual name of the shared directory and name_of_link with whatever you want. However the name-of-link shouldn't exist in the directory where you want to create the link(That is there should be no folder or file with that name). Alternatively, you can just drag the folder in Nautilus to the right navigation area and it will create an easy to access link.\n\nA: The mounted share folder belongs to the vboxsf user. You, as a user, were not added to the vboxsf group. To allow access to the shared folders permanently, copy and paste this command in a Terminal window:\nsudo usermod -G vboxsf -a $USER\n\n$USER will be replaced with your username. This command appends the user <username> to the vboxsf group, which is the owner of the shared folders (found in /media/... on the Ubuntu box).\nYou won't need to run a script at startup once you own the mounted shared folder.\nBut you will most likely need to logout and on again (or restart).\n", "Q: How to Install Huawei Mobile Partner 21 in Ubuntu We can't send SMSs, USSD codes, make calls or get Data Usage from Huawaei 3G dongles/data cards without Huawei mobile partner.

Wine automatically adds certain mimetypes and file associations (e.g. notepad.exe for .ini files). There already is an answer that explains how to remove these associations.\nBut how can one prevent Wine from adding them again and again?\n\nA: Disabling winemenubuilder.exe altogether will prevent wine from hijacking your file associations, but it will also prevent it from creating menu entries for newly installed software, which may be an undesired behavior. The better solution is this:\n\n\n*\n\n*Remove existing wine hijacks (from wine FAQ):\nrm -f ~/.local/share/mime/packages/x-wine*\nrm -f ~/.local/share/applications/wine-extension*\nrm -f ~/.local/share/icons/hicolor/*/*/application-x-wine-extension*\nrm -f ~/.local/share/mime/application/x-wine-extension* \n\n\n*Edit /usr/share/wine/wine.inf (as root), find the [Services] section:\n[Services]\nHKLM,%CurrentVersion%\\RunServices,\"winemenubuilder\",2,\"%11%\\winemenubuilder.exe -a -r\"\n...\n\nand edit it so it says:\n[Services]\nHKLM,%CurrentVersion%\\RunServices,\"winemenubuilder\",2,\"%11%\\winemenubuilder.exe -r\"\n...\n\n(namely, to start winemenubuilder.exe without the -a switch).\nThis will prevent updating file associations on new user accounts (or with new WINEPREFIXes).\n\n*Edit your $WINEPREFIX/system.reg file (if it exists) in similar fashion. Where it says\n[Software\\\\Microsoft\\\\Windows\\\\CurrentVersion\\\\RunServices]\n\"winemenubuilder\"=\"C:\\\\windows\\\\system32\\\\winemenubuilder.exe -a -r\"\n\nremove the -a switch. (By default, WINEPREFIX=$HOME/.wine.)\nThis will prevent wine from stealing your preferred mimeapps, but the winemenubuilder will still run and create convenient desktop entries for your Windoze software.\n\nA: From http://wiki.winehq.org/FAQ:\nUsers who do not want the installer for a Windows app to change filetype associations, add menu items, or create desktop links, can disable winemenubuilder.exe . There are several ways to do this:\n\n\n*\n\n*In winecfg: before running the installer, run winecfg. Go to the Libraries tab and type winemenubuilder.exe into the \"New overrides\" box (it is not in the dropdown list). Click add, then select it from the \"Existing overrides\" box. Click \"Edit\" and select \"Disable\" from the list, then click \"Apply\".\n\n*Registry file: If you need to apply the setting many times (e.g. every time you recreate the Wine prefix), this approach may be more convenient. Create a text file named with extension .reg (e.g., disable-winemenubuilder.reg) containing the following:\n[HKEY_CURRENT_USER\\Software\\Wine\\DllOverrides] \n\"winemenubuilder.exe\"=\"\"\n\nTo apply the setting, run regedit disable-winemenubuilder.reg\n\n*Environment variable: set the WINEDLLOVERRIDES environment variable when you run the installer, e.g.,\nWINEDLLOVERRIDES=winemenubuilder.exe=d wine setup.exe\n\nDisabling winemenubuilder.exe will cause wine programs to print errors that they cannot find it (though the errors do not seem to interfere with program operation). \n\nAn alternative approach that avoids the errors is to replace it with the do-nothing program. Compile the following with MinGW's gcc under wine and place the executable at C:\\Windows\\System32\\winemenubuilder.exe:\n  int main() { /* Do nothing */ return 0; }\n\nThen follow the same procedure as above, but set winemenubuilder.exe to \"native\" instead of \"disable\".\n\nA: Since this is the first hit on Google. The Wine FAQ now lists an alternative method for newer versions of wine.\n\"Beginning with wine-3.14, winecfg has a \"Manage File Associations\" checkbox on the Desktop Integration tab. Checking it enables winemenbuilder to create file associations and unchecking it disables that behavior.\"\n\nA: Here's a script that automates step 1 and 3 of Hi-Angel's answer to be used for multiple prefixes:\n#!/bin/bash\n# Workaround for winemenubuilder bloating file associations by default\n\n# Remove all existing associations\nrm -f ~/.local/share/mime/packages/x-wine*\nrm -f ~/.local/share/applications/wine-extension*\nrm -f ~/.local/share/icons/hicolor/*/*/application-x-wine-extension*\nrm -f ~/.local/share/mime/application/x-wine-extension*\n\n# Disable winemenubuilder for all existing registries\n# Replace ~/.bottles with your prefix/\"bottle\" directories\nfor sysreg in $(find ~/.wine ~/.bottles -name system.reg);\ndo\n    sed -i 's/winemenubuilder.exe -a/winemenubuilder.exe/' $sysreg\ndone\n\n", "Q: Install Printer Usb Router I have Ubuntu 12.04 and connecting the printer directly via USB print perfectly but I want to have it connected to the USB port of my router and print through there, as I have in windows xp and from which it works perfectly.\nI have searched information about it but im miss.

I recently bought a Dell Inspiron 3521 (15”, Intel i3 processor, 4GB RAM, 500GB hard drive, A07 BIOS from InsydeH2O) with Windows 8 pre-installed. I expected to be able to install Ubuntu 12.04.2 from CD and dual-boot, as I do with my other main laptop (which has Windows 7). 95% of my work is done under Ubuntu, but I want to preserve access to Windows for a few things that require it.\nThis turned out to be MUCH harder than I expected. Forums provided conflicting and misleading info. No BIOS manual is available and Dell technical support didn’t officially want to help me as they said Ubuntu was unsupported (though some of the techss were nice to me and gave me some suggestions, unfortunately useless).\nQuestions: Can you boot from a CD under UEFI? Will the installation work if I boot Ubuntu in legacy mode? Should I have Secure Boot enabled or disabled? Why doesn’t the Ubuntu installer see the Windows system? If I repartition the drive manually, how should I do it? But mostly, what is the overall strategy for getting Ubuntu installed alongside Windows on this machine?\nI’m an experienced user, but I don’t normally have to deal with technical boot issues or partitioning.\nIf I can’t figure it out, will it work to just trash the Windows installation and install Ubuntu on the whole drive?\nHere is my Boot-Repair info:\nhttp://paste.ubuntu.com/5902327\n1. Legacy mode or UEFI?\nThe BIOS offers the option to switch between Legacy mode and UEFI.\nBooting from the Ubuntu CD in legacy mode is no problem. But if I do that and install Ubuntu, won’t it be a problem that Ubuntu was installed as legacy and Windows as UEFI?\nI thought it was better to install Ubuntu from a CD booted under UEFI, and imagined I would be able to boot from the CD under UEFI by changing the BIOS settings to allow booting from CD. There is a tab in the UEFI section of the BIOS called “Add Boot Option” which on the face of it seems to offer a way to do this. If I select “Add Boot Option,” it asks for a name for the new boot option and then you can choose a file system and file path. But the only two file systems presented as options appear to be two partitions of the hard drive (they have very long names starting with Acpi). And there is no info anywhere on what to put in as the file path.\nInterestingly, when I made recovery disks for the Windows system and tried to boot from them under UEFI, it recognized them, and then briefly presents the CD under the following file system name in the UEFI menu: Acpi(PNP0A03,0)/Pci(1FI2)/Sata(2,0,0)/CDROM(Entry 1).\n2. If I use UEFI, should I have SecureBoot enabled?\nAlso, should have the Legacy OPROM on and what does that mean anyway? Should I have SecureBoot in Standard or Custom mode? Note that I already disabled fast startup in the Windows 8 settings.\n3. Why doesn’t the Ubuntu installer see Windows 8?\nWhen I boot the Ubuntu CD in legacy mode, and start the process of installing Ubuntu, it doesn’t see the Windows 8 OS. It just gives me two options: “Erase the disk and install Ubuntu” and “Do something else.” It doesn’t give me the “Install Ubuntu alongside other operating systems” option.\n4. How can I edit the partition table to give Ubuntu space on the HD?\nIf I then click on “Do something else,” the partition table comes up with 6 partitions all of which are being used by Windows. Can I edit and rearrange the partitions to get Ubuntu to work? If so, how?\n\nUPDATE\nAfter much trial and error I figured out the reason for my problem. I was using an Ubuntu 12.04.2 image which had no EFI folder or other EFI boot information. (This despite the assurances everywhere that Ubuntu 12.04.2 is UEFI compatible. Admittedly, I downloaded the image from a mirror rather than from the official Ubuntu website).\nWithout an EFI folder, EFI boot managers (whether the built-in Dell one or rEFInd) do not recognize the Ubuntu image as bootable.\nI downloaded another Ubuntu image and presto, it was recognized, and I was able to install it correctly. (Although I did have to shrink the Windows partitions and create partitions for Ubuntu manually.)\n\nA: I think you might want to look at the entry on the ubuntu wiki about UEFI.\n1.\nFrom the Ubuntu wiki\n\n\n*\n\n*if the other systems (Windows Vista/7/8, GNU/Linux...) of your computer are installed in EFI mode, then you must install Ubuntu in EFI mode too.\n\n*if the other systems (Windows, GNU/Linux...) of your computer are installed in Legacy (not-EFI) mode, then you must install Ubuntu in Legacy mode too. Eg if your computer is old (<2010), is 32bits, or was sold with a pre-installed Windows XP.\n\n*if Ubuntu is the only operating system on your computer, then it does not matter, you can install Ubuntu in EFI mode or not.\nSo if you keep Windows you must use EFI mode but if you trash it you can use any mode.\n4.\nYou have normally only used MBR until now which can only have 4 primary/secondary partitions. GPT can have as many as you like. However I don't know if you can swap them. You can resize them however I don't think that might cause trouble.\nI suggest you to use GParted for this (warning: fdisk does not support GPT) so choose Try Ubuntu. See the arch wiki for GPT infos.\nSee also this.\n\nA: Can you boot from a CD under UEFI?\nGenerally speaking, yes. As a practical matter, some EFIs make this difficult because of poor user interfaces. If you have trouble, try creating a USB installation medium; that might help. Another option might be to install my rEFInd boot manager using Windows. It should provide options to boot CDs or USB flash drives -- but there are cases when this doesn't work because of very flaky EFIs.\nWill the installation work if I boot Ubuntu in legacy mode?\nGenerally speaking, keeping both OSes booting in the same mode (EFI/UEFI or BIOS/CSM/legacy) is the best policy. Some computers do permit switching between modes, but that's generally difficult. rEFInd can sometimes make this a bit less awkward, but you'll need to edit the refind.conf file, uncomment the scanfor line, and ensure that hdbios is included among the options. If successful, you'll then see a new grayscale icon that will launch GRUB (or whatever boot loader is installed in the protective MBR).\nIt's also possible to install Ubuntu in BIOS/CSM/legacy mode and then switch the Ubuntu boot mode by installing an EFI boot loader for Linux. This is usually more effort than installing in EFI mode to begin with, but if your firmware offers unusual obstacles to EFI-mode booting the Ubuntu installer, it might be your best option.\nShould I have Secure Boot enabled or disabled?\nIn theory, Ubuntu supports Secure Boot. In practice, it often generates problem reports. Go ahead and try it with Secure Boot enabled, but if you run into troubles getting the Ubuntu installer (or installed Ubuntu OS on your hard disk) to start the boot process, disable Secure Boot. You can enable it later if you like. Note that if you see a GRUB menu or if the installer starts, Secure Boot is not a problem. If Secure Boot causes problems, the symptom is likely to be that the computer boots straight into Windows with either no error message or a brief message to the effect that a boot loader triggered a security violation.\nWhy doesn’t the Ubuntu installer see the Windows system?\nFrom your description, Ubuntu did see Windows; it simply didn't present an option to automatically shrink the Windows partition and install Linux in the gap. You should do one of two things:\n\n\n*\n\n*Before running the installer, shrink the Windows partition and leave an unpartitioned space for Ubuntu to consume.\n\n*In the installer, select the poorly-named \"something else\" option, shrink the Windows partition, and set up your Ubuntu partitions manually.\n\n\nPersonally, I prefer the second choice, since it will give you the opportunity to create a separate /home partition, which I consider important.\nIf I repartition the drive manually, how should I do it?\nAsk 10 people this question and you'll get 11 answers. There are also about a bazillion Web pages on the subject. Do a Web search and take your pick of the answers.\n", "Q: How can I run .exe files in ubuntu?

I tried g++ in console and it said the program was not installed. gcc -v shows c++ among other languages in --enable-languages.\nSo, the question basically is: how come gcc package does not contain the C++ compiler (g++)?

I am pretty sure with Ubuntu 12.10 I had g++ from the beginning.\n\nA: gcc and g++(gcc for C, g++ for C++, etc.) are driver programs(very often they are distributed as seperate packages thus installing one does not guarantee another) which \nusers invoke.

As it happens, we can get the strange OSError: [Errno 2] No such file or directory when trying to exec a 32-bit executable on a 64-bit system without libc6:i386 installed.\nInvestigating further into /usr/lib/pbuilder/pbuilder-satisfydepends-gdebi, we find that gdebi satisfies the dependencies from outside the chroot by executing dpkg inside the chroot,\nINSTALL=$(/usr/bin/gdebi --quiet --root $CHROOT --apt-line $NO_RECOMMENDS $DEBIAN_CONTROL)\n$CHROOTEXEC /usr/bin/apt-get install -y \"${APTGETOPT[@]}\" $INSTALL\n\nSo without the multiarch libraries necessary to execute a 32-bit dpkg on a 64-bit host, this is going to fail. Another option is to use the aptitude resolver, which works inside the chroot, so shouldn't have problems either way.\n\nA: I went though the same error in a recent pbuilder build and added the following snippet to the ~/.pbuilderrc file so it automatically installs and uses the aptitude resolver when the host and guest architecture differ.\nif [ \"${ARCH}\" = \"$(dpkg --print-architecture)\" ]; then\n    #gdebi resolution, requires gdebi-core\n    if command -v \"gdebi\" >/dev/null 2>&1; then\n        PBUILDERSATISFYDEPENDSCMD=\"/usr/lib/pbuilder/pbuilder-satisfydepends-gdebi\" || true\n        rm -rf \"${HOOKDIR}/D01install_aptitude_resolver\"\n    else\n        printf \"%s\\\\n\" '#!/bin/sh' > \"${HOOKDIR}/D01install_aptitude_resolver\"\n        printf \"%s\\\\n\" 'apt-get install -y --no-install-recommends aptitude' >> \"${HOOKDIR}/D01install_aptitude_resolver\"\n        chmod +x \"${HOOKDIR}/D01install_aptitude_resolver\"\n    fi\nelse\n    printf \"%s\\\\n\" '#!/bin/sh' > \"${HOOKDIR}/D01install_aptitude_resolver\"\n    printf \"%s\\\\n\" 'apt-get install -y --no-install-recommends aptitude' >> \"${HOOKDIR}/D01install_aptitude_resolver\"\n    chmod +x \"${HOOKDIR}/D01install_aptitude_resolver\"\nfi\n\n", "Q: Install/Play Minecraft on Xubuntu 13.04 I´ve just installed Xubuntu and installed java on it and I can't play minecraft and have no idea how to install it!

(similar to CentOS). Or from /etc/network/interfaces file is it possible to call other interfaces files? My idea is to have ethernet stanzas in one file, vlan's in another, vpn's in another, etc (or something similar). By doing it this way, it would be easier for me to edit and parse (yes I know there are parsers out there), but I think by having them separate in different files it would be more organized.\nI have tried to look for answers in google for several days, and man interfaces but I haven't found anything. I'm thinking is not possible (unless modifying source code from the OS I guess). Anyone knows anything about this?\nI'm using Ubuntu 12.04 LTS Server x64\nThanks!\n\nA: This is certainly possible. See the interfaces(5) manpage for full details, but I'll include a fragment of the man page here:\n   Lines beginning with \"source\" are used to include stanzas from other  files,  so\n   configuration can be split into many files. The word \"source\" is followed by the\n   path of file to be sourced. Shell wildcards can be used.

I was using Ubuntu few years back but unfortunately I had to move to Windows :( But again I think it's the time to move to Ubuntu with a new computer :)\nI'm a web designer, graphic designer. So I love to know, are there any alternatives for Adobe Photoshop, Illustrator & Dreamweaver? I was using those applications with Wine (the windows layer for ubuntu) because GIMP, Inkspace & KompoZer couldn't fill the gap made by Adobe applications. Also Wine doesn't work 100% okay, so it was kinda hard for me to use Ubuntu. \nBut now I badly want to move with this kind hearted OS. Can anyone please let me know is that possible to fill the gap in Ubuntu which Adobe applications make or will Adobe look at Linux? \n\nA: if I were you, I would use Virtual Box on Ubuntu. I would install windows on that virtualbox, I would use the required programs for a designer.. \n\nA: At this time, Adobe has no intentions to develop their software for the best operating system. Running these applications in wine is not very stable and usually ends up in crashing and loosing work. :(\nI would recommend finding a free and open source alternative to each piece of software. Here are some alternatives to the software you listed:\n\n\n*\n\n*Photoshop: GIMP\n\n*Illustrator: Inkscape\n\n*Dreamweaver: (Seriously?) gedit\n\n\nYou may also try running it in a virtual machine, such as Oracle VirtualBox.\n\nA: I am arquitect, do also some graphics work, and use only Ubuntu. As mentioned in another answer, in some cases you will have to use Wine, or better, Virtual box. Wine is unstable, especially when it comes to print out things etc. \nFormat conversion is still the big problem.

Probably you don't have to do anything to make it work, as other posters confirm, that it is included in Ubuntu. If you are new to Ubuntu you have to know, that most scanners and printers are installed by default. That means you just have to connect the USB-Cable to your computer, open \"Simple Scan\" (Open the Dash pressing Super or Windows next to Alt, then write \"simple scan\" enter) and press Scan. \nIf no scanner is found, you will get a message.\n\nA: For my LIDE 110  scanner I found the following solution\nJust install Simple Scan or Skanlite from the Ubuntu Software Center.

I was tired. I somehow was one directory level above where I thought I was, and recursively gave the whole world read permissions of /run. (Yes, I know...)\nI assume that certain files within /run are already set up like this, so I don't want to just recursively remove the permission.\nAs it turns out, I don't have a backup of this folder (something else to fix).\nDo I just leave it, go for a full reinstall, or is there another option?\n\nA: /run is of type tmpfs, meaning it exists in memory only, and disappears once the system is powered down. Check this by running mount with no arguments, you'll see stuff like:\ntmpfs on /run type tmpfs (rw,noexec,nosuid,size=10%,mode=0755)\nnone on /run/lock type tmpfs (rw,noexec,nosuid,nodev,size=5242880)\nnone on /run/shm type tmpfs (rw,nosuid,nodev)\nnone on /run/user type tmpfs (rw,noexec,nosuid,nodev,size=104857600,mode=0755)\n\nAll files in /run simply contain runtime information for system services and daemons. As long as the permissions for the directory itself (/run should have mode 755 and be owned by root), you should be able to reboot the system to get a \"clean slate\". No important data should be lost.\n", "Q: Janitor broke my visual interface - Xubuntu 12.04 yesterday a performed a couple of updates and after that i have executed Janitor (from within ubuntu-tweak) to cleanup (incl. everything, also old kernels) my system (Xubuntu 12.04.2, running on a recent Dell Inspiron 15R, dual boot with windows 8, hybrid graphics ATI7670). This turned out to be a bad mistake, when i power on the laptop and select Xubuntu from Grub i still do see the xubuntu loading screen, but after that i end up at a command line login (tty1). \nMy first idea was that i maybe somehow broke the kernel, so i decided to reinstall it - but now change. Next, i have checked some log files (syslog, kern.log, Xorg.0.log), the kern and sys logs do look ok, but the Xorg.0.log gave me some errors. Maybe i should add here that iam using the AMD catalyst driver (12.10.5) to control my hybrid graphics setup.

My next step would be to reinstall catalyst from the commandline (any suggestions how to that the best way?). Since iam relying on this laptop a lot for work i would appreciate any help.\nBest wishes\n\nA: It appears that you indeed accidentally removed the proprietary AMD driver (fglrx in the log). Log in to your virtual terminal and execute sudo jockey-text from there to reinstall it. Then you should be good to go. If possible, please inform the developer of computer-janitor of this misbehavior.\nWhat I did to resolve this even though I did not have an AMD card: \n\n\n*\n\n*fglrx caught my attention\n\n*apt-cache search fglrx yielded jockey-gtk. It appeared already installed.\n\n*Since you have no graphics I tried jockey-Tab on the terminal\n\n*jockey-text was autocompleted and executed but did not find any additional (read: proprietary) drivers.

I recently got a PC with Windows 8 pre-installed. It has a 1TB HDD and 24GB SSD. So I decided to dual-boot with Ubuntu, using the simple method (\"Install Ubuntu beside W8\"). However, the only disk space that popped up for the partition to be made was the SSD, which I assumed I could use just to install the Ubuntu OS. Now, when running Ubuntu it says there is not enough room for files and things. \nI then went and partitioned my HDD for 250GB space to use for Ubuntu (now unallocated) but I have no idea how to make Ubuntu use that free space for the necessary files instead of the SSD.

If you were to combine them as a single storage unit, you could not remove the sdcard.\n\nA: Ubuntu installs a lot of things you probably don't need. 8 GB is probably not enough, my own system has 16GB already (only the system, I have seperate drives/partitions for home and swap).\nI think you would be better of with a much lighter distro (Ubuntu has gained some weight over the years).\nTry installing Lubuntu, I think you will need about 5GB for the system so this should work.\nuse zram swap (http://www.webupd8.org/2011/10/increased-performance-in-linux-with.html).\nit is possible to use the SD card as your home partition but beware: removing it can lead to unforseen consequences. \n", "Q: Capturing step by step actions Is there some tool to automated capture of step by step actions and screenshots during some task performing on computer with Ubuntu?\nP.S.

I deleted Windows 7 from my computer (where the internet worked without any kind of problems) and installed Ubuntu 13.04, but now i'm having some trouble here.\nI can't connect to the internet using my WiFi, it connects to my router. DEPENDING, on the site that I pings on terminal it doesn't have answer. I can't browse on internet using it and Ubuntu can't connect to archive.ubuntu to download packages or updates.\nTo used my cable connection I had to restart my notebook some times until it connects and it keeps barely working. It seems like I'm using a 90's internet connection. When I try to download or update certain packages, most of the connections to the server are unsuccessful. \nI'd like some help, thanks. \n\nA: (Based on input from your other question that got deleted...)\nThe one thing I can think of that the software center, apt-get, and the \"certain websites\" you mentioned (including Facebook and YouTube when you're logged in) all have in common is that they use an encrypted connection.\nSo maybe it's a problem with encrypted connections. Please confirm this by trying out several websites with and without SSL (provided they support it). For example, try both:\n\n\n*\n\n*http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page and\n\n*https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page\nIf my guess is correct, the first one should load without problems but the second one should be slow.\nNow to be honest, I have little clue as to what you should attempt to do in order to fix this. I can suggest one thing that might and might not be useful, and that would be reconfiguring all SSL related packages on your system.\nFirst, query them using:\ndpkg --get-selections | grep ssl\n\nThen, after stripping the version and architecture (if any), you can reconfigure them using:\ndpkg-reconfigure pkg1 pkg2 pkg3 pkg4 etc.\n\nYou might want to reboot after reconfiguring them.\nAlso, while at it, you can try booting up a live CD/USB and seeing whether things work well from there.\n", "Q: Password security: Ubuntu Forums Security Breach If the passwords were encrypted is there really a problem?\nI have not used the forum for some time and can't remember the details.\nAdvice please.\n\nA: Even if the passwords are encrypted the PCs these days have become powerful enough to use bruteforce attack on the hash to find the passwords within reasonable time. I myself don't remember the forum password I used to use. So to be on the safer side, it would be prudent to change the password in websites where you feel that you've used the same password.\nUpdate:\nCanonical in its statement on the Ubuntu forums home page, has told:\n\nThe passwords are not stored in plain text, they are stored as salted\n  hashes. However, if you were using the same password as your Ubuntu\n  Forums one on another service (such as email), you are strongly\n  encouraged to change the password on the other service ASAP.\n\nThe use of salt will make it more difficult to find the password from the hash, but still it'll be safer to change the password, wherever required. To know more about Salt, please check out: Salt (cryptography)\n", "Q: Login Problem after home folder name changed I have changed my home folder name through command mv olderFolder newFolder and then restarted, but not able to login. What step did I miss?\n\nA: After rename your home directory you should still tell linux about your new home directory\nThis can be done by editing /etc/passwd file\nJust open that file and change /home/olderFolder to /home/newFolder\nFor Example:\nOLD:\nmitesh:x:1000:1000:Mitesh Shah:/home/mitesh:/bin/bash\n\nNEW:\nmitesh:x:1000:1000:Mitesh Shah:/home/miteshshah:/bin/bash\n\n\nA: It is not a good idea (as you found out) to rename your home folder.\nIf you can, log in as root and rename your folder by issuing\nsudo mv /home/newFolder /home/olderFolder\n\nIf you don't have a root login, get an Live CD, boot it, don't install but simply 'repair' an existing installation.

Today i have tried to re-install from scratch the latest ubuntu version (13.04) on the latest virtualbox (4.2.16) but immediatelly after the installation it prompts an error that compiz has \"crashed\"...has anybody any similar issue ?\nThanks in advance.\n\nA: It is not unusual to experience crashes from bugs not yet fixed with the version you installed from the downloaded .iso installer.\nIt is therefore best advice to immediately upgrade your guest OS after completing the installation. In case we do not have access to the desktop we can do so from booting to a root shell and issue the following commands:\napt-get update\napt-get dist-upgrade\n\nWe also have to install the Guest Additions for Compiz.\nThis will add considerable stability to our system. However some crashes may still occur occasionally.\n", "Q: Installing non-standard fonts in xubuntu 13.04 Before I start: I'm a Mac user whose 7 year old laptop is slowly dying and, wanting to support open-source software, I've been considering a Linux pre-loaded laptop as my next computer. In preparation for the shock of a new operating system I've been playing with Xubuntu as a VM on my iMac for the past couple of days. I love it but I have no idea what I'm doing really.\nI am a typography enthusiast and as such can't do without gorgeous free fonts. So, despite feeling that the experiment was doomed to failure, I decided to download a heap of fonts and attempt to install them. They were all .ttf format, so I thought it should be possible, and I know where the fonts folder is so I can put them there manually if necessary. But...nope. I've been stalled by my number 1 problem since I started playing around with Linux: I CAN'T FIND THE DOWNLOADED FILES. AT ALL. So I can't do ANYTHING with them, because I don't know what they're called, or where they are, or even if they're there at all.\nThey were zips and automatically extracted when I downloaded them. At least, I ASSUME they automatically extracted, because the archive manager window appeared to show the files that had been extracted (when I downloaded the fonts Firefox asked me 'Open with Archive Manager?' and I said yes.) \nAs far as I remember it said they were extracted to the home folder. But, as mentioned previously, I can't find them. I've done a catfish file search for .ttf, all hidden files shown (I don't put much faith in Catfish, as I don't think it REALLY searches everything, but I was prepared to try anything). I also downloaded Fonty Python to see if it could find them; I got it to run through every folder and sub-folder on the virtual drive, but nope, it only found the Microsoft fonts that were already installed. I looked in the fonts folder myself just in case. No luck.\nI have no idea what to do. It's like when I download certain things they just vanish without a trace. As a complete Linux newbie, maybe I'm missing something really obvious here...\n\nA: By default, if you choose \"Open with\", Firefox downloads the file in /tmp.\nBy default, if you choose \"Save file\", Firefox downloads the file in the Downloads subdirectory of the home.\n\nA: If you have problems with managing your downloaded files, better just select to download into a directory instead of opening with Archive Manager. That way, you would know where the archive is and extract it multiple times. \nAs for your lost files, you can find them by searching your whole system via terminal:\nfind / -type f -name \"*.ttf\"\n\nIn short, \"/\" stands for root directory, you can change it by simply indicating /home/yourname/ or any other location. -type f means that it's searching for files and -name \"*.ttf\" searches for all ttf extension having files.\nHope this helps :)\n", "Q: Command line dvd creation with chapters and menu I have several personal video and I would like to put them on a dvd. \nI would like to classify them by year; so the menu would list the year, and each video should be a chapter.\nI could do that with a gui program like Devede, 2mandvd,... but as I have a lots of videos, and as I just want to organise them by date, it could be faster to automate the creation with a script.\nSo, is there a tool which can create menus and chapter and that I can integrate in a batch  script?\n\nA: Probably dvdauthor could be used for your task, although it might take some work to get the results you desire. You'd have to use your script to write an XML input file for dvdauthor. \nI'd start with a GUI frontend of dvdauthor to create an example input file, which then could be used as a template for the script.\n", "Q: How to capture https traffic I am trying to capture the requests of my android emulator.

I have emulated my android device in ubuntu and I want to capture all traffic of my android emulator(http and https) using a tool.\nWe have fiddler in windows but this emulator stuff did not work there.\n\nA: Consider wireshark\nsudo apt-get install wireshark\n\nThis should help you sniff out any traffic originating from your android emulator to http https based on a variety of filter criteria.\n\nA: Use wireshark or command line tool tshark. tcpdump is another option.\nsudo apt-get install tcpdump\ntcpdump -i $interface\n\n", "Q: Can ubuntu run all types of files, .rar, .zip, etc I'm new to ubuntu, and I'm just now installing it, i've backed up some files and I'm going to completely system restore and I'm saving some files onto .rar's. from my website database.\nI was wondering if I can use .rar on ubuntu?\n\nA: Run like? you would like to unzip a file? If this is what you are looking for then yes, it can. In fact you don't have to install anything, if it is missing for example .rar package it will prompt you then if you want to install it and it will do the rest of the job automaticaly.\n\nA: Yes, Ubuntu can use .rar as well. Archive Manager (application) opens it with no problem, as well as  ZIP and other arhive type documents. \n\nA: Yes. There are at least two command line tools available that can handle .rar files, and if one of them is installed, many GUI tools can use them to handle .rar files.\nI recommend to install unrar-nonfree (it's not free as free speech, but still free as free beer), since the free as free speech GNU unrar utility cannot handle all .rar formats (there are actually different versions....). A third alternative would be 7zip, yet I don't know if the version available in Ubuntu is compiled with .rar support.\n\nA: Yes. Obviously, you can open .rar or .zip file in ubuntu.\nUbuntu has a default application named 'Archive Manager'. It can't open .rar file. But If you try to open .rar file or .zip file with it it will ask you to download commands to do that.And If you have internet connection you can download those commands. And then Archive Manager will be able to open your .rar or .zip file.\n\nA: Yes,\nbut you will need to install unrar package.\n", "Q: Videos are not playing properly I installed Ubuntu 13.04 on my laptop having ati amd radeon graphics card.But in Ubuntu I experience lots of trouble like the videos are not playing flawlessly. sometimes it stucks.\nI used every graphics drivers in additional drivers list.

I installed it via    sudo apt-get install xmonad.\nNow that I have it, I'm not sure how to continue. How would I go about setting it as my default window and panel manager instead of unity?\n\nA: The Xmonad wiki is very helpful. You need to logout and during the login select your session. The session descriptions are stored in\n/usr/share/applications/\n\nas .desktop files. Since you installed from the repos there should already be one. So you can just select Xmonad as your session during login and it will start instead of unity. The setting will remain, so to get back unity you have to select it during login.\nIf you want Xmonad with a Gnome session, you'll have to create another .desktop file. It is explained in the wiki: Xmonad with Gnome session.\nThe first time you login in into Xmonad you won't see much. It's just a black background with .. well nothing. You have to add the status bar yourself (in the config). Here are the default keybindings. You can start a terminal with mod-return (mod is the windows key) or launch other applications with mod-p.\nFinnaly you probably want to configure Xmonad. The config is stored in ~/.xmonad/xmonad.hs and you can add additional haskell code to ~/.xmonad/lib/.\nHere is the wiki on configs. Though the repo version of ubuntu 12.04 might be a bit old. I compiled it myself to have a new version of Xmonad.\n\nA: After you install xmonad, and you either log-out or reboot your system, once it comes to the login screen, click the little circle, as shown in the image below.\n\nThen choose the session that you want, and login.  Next time you boot, or logout, it will take you back to the same session, unless you change it.\n\n", "Q: Can I run XAMPP installed on Windows partition I have been using XAMPP on Windows 7.

Other than that I have no clue, any help will be GREATLY appreciated.\n\nA: You need to find out the requirements of the software you are trying to run. You need to know:\n\n\n*\n\n*If it needs Java 6 or Java 7 - they are not 100% compatible.\n\n*If it actually needs the Oracle JDK, or if you can use OpenJDK.\n\n*How much memory it actually needs.\n\n\nThen, you need to make sure you have the correct version of Java installed, and selected as the default using the update-java-alternatives tool. The webupd8team PPA is currently the best way to install the Oracle version of Java; the oab-java6 does not work for Java 6 due to changes Oracle have made to their download website. If you can use the OpenJDK, you can just install it using apt-get. Your pastebin shows that you are running the 64-bit version of the Oracle JDK.\nI don't understand why running java -version would result in an error, unless perhaps you were still running your application and it is eating all your memory.\nBottom line: If Java is running out of memory, you either need to allocate it more, or your application has a memory leak.

Also since I am French and that my firstname has a \"é\", it creats an error in Ubuntu Software Center, which is very infortunate.\nWhere can I find some doc about this option in Ubuntu SDK? There is a lot for packaging doc for Ubuntu but none for Ubuntu Touch.\nThank you and sorry to ask something again but I am new in this kind of things and the tuto on the Ubuntu website (here) stops before the packaging. It might be a good thing to go from the begining to the end on it.\n\nA: The packaging of Ubuntu Touch application is in a transitional period right now. The emphasis is more on the new Click packaging format and less on the good old .deb format. In the present Ubuntu SDK relase both are supported.\nFor the .deb packaging the QtCreator relies on two environment vairables, the DEBEMAIL and the DEBFULLNAME. You can set those variables in the .bashrc file in the home folder. The .deb packaging feature in the QTCreator works fine and it is good for playing around, but the development effort is going on the new Click packaging.\n", "Q: How safe is Ubuntu for \"non-geek\" users How vulnerable is Linux in general from finger faults from normal everyday Windows users?\n\nA: From my experience, I would say that once you set up a Ubuntu box properly, normal users won't make it crash easily. My parents are not exactly technical people, and they have been using Linux distributions for years without larger problems (actually they got a Fedora box just now).\n\nA: Ubuntu doesn't underestimate security. It was written with security in mind, unlike Windows.  By default Ubuntu won't allow you to download or install any programs without some form of permissions.\nYou don't need anti virus software.  It's also reliable and well written.  Everything Windows can do Linux can do as well.\nTry it out!  Choose try Ubuntu once you download it , and create either a bootable CD/DVD or USB drive.  See image below to see if Ubuntu is for you.\nI believe Ubuntu is making great progress in making its software more user friendly and easier to use.\n\nPart of the info compliments of Squidoo\n\nA: I think Windows is much more problematic with \"finger faults\" but of course it's easier to handle because most applications are written for windows. And it's easier to install any other software. If you want to play the administrator and help them to configure everything , Ubuntu is a good Idea.

I am new to Ubuntu and I used to do everything on Windows. As much as I know Windows has \"read only\" file option for the user. However, in my opinion, Ubuntu allow the user to manipulate file permissions excessively. \n\ndrwxrwxrwx 2 ttt ttt 4096 Tem 24 13:04 dante\n\n\n\n*\n\n*There are three groups of user; owner, group and other respectively.\n\n\nNormally the one who creating the file is the owner. Then who are the \"group\" and the \"other\". Is this used more for server like systems where there are many user?\nEven if this is used for security issues, without \"$sudo\" it can be easily change to whatever wanted.\nCan you also suggest any further reading? \nIt may be possible that I am exaggerating \"chmod\", but still I will thank you if you answer.\n\nA: I believe this breaks down into a few closely interrelated questions, which are answerable with a reasonable degree of objectivity.\nWhy does Ubuntu allow different kinds of permissions to be adjusted for different users and groups of users? Is this high degree of configurability really necessary?\nAlmost all currently used operating systems, including Windows, have this functionality. Actually, on Windows the system is more complex, because Windows uses access control lists for almost everything while Ubuntu uses the simpler system of Unix-style ownership and permissions most of the time (but also supports access control lists).\nA few reasons this is necessary:\n\n\n*\n\n*If you want your computer to be accessed by users other than yourself, you need the ability to decide that some files are totally off-limits to certain users, and that others are readable but unmodifiable by certain users.\nRemember, this includes people who you might want to access your computer over a network. Such as yourself. Many people want to be able to share files between computers at home, or with their friends, but not with just anybody who happens to be using the same public wireless network. Thus users represent more people than you might actually have physically using your keyboard.\n\n*The operating system you're using--Ubuntu--is the same OS as Ubuntu Server. They have different packages installed by default, and different installers. You can transform a server system into a desktop system and vice versa. A full system of ownership and permissions is necessary for most servers, even if it may not be necessary for some desktops. The desktops work fine with it; the servers would not work without it.\n\n*User accounts can represent real people who access your computer, but they represent a whole lot more than that, too. A user account represents a collection of abilities. Special user accounts exist for performing particular tasks with constrained abilities.\nThe purpose of this is twofold. First, the developer of the software, or the user, could make a mistake resulting in the software attempting to perform some action that can be known beforehand could only cause harm.\nSecond, a malicious party might deliberately fool the software performing the specialized task into doing something bad, like destroying data or allowing the malicious person to control it.\nIn both of these cases, harm is often reduced if the task is performed by a non-privileged user that doesn't represent any particular human user of the computer, but exists just to perform that particular task.\nIf you only have a few human user accounts set up on your Ubuntu system, then most of the user accounts listed by running cat /etc/passwd are this kind of \"user.\" (Don't worry, running cat /etc/passwd does not actually show you people's passwords; the file is called that mainly for historical reasons.)\nWhat's the point of Ubuntu limiting my user account's access to anything, if I'm an administrator and can perform any action as root with sudo?\nThe same reason there are guard rails on the sides of some roads, manhole (personhole?) covers, a cover over the needle at the end of a syringe, safeties on firearms, etc. And not for the same reason that people put locks on their doors. Not to keep you from doing something deliberately that you do want to do, but to keep you from doing something accidentally that you do not want to do.\nWhen you want/need to perform an administrative task, it is important that you be able to do it easily. Your control over your own machine must be respected, plus a system that's unnecessarily hard to use is not very good. If Ubuntu prevents you from easily performing administrative actions, that is a bug. Fortunately, this is not usually the case (though I fear we're moving in that direction). One of the reasons Ubuntu uses sudo is that it generally facilitates easily running commands/programs as root, without reducing your ability to perform ordinary, non-administrative actions concurrently.\nWhen you're not trying to modify your system in some deep way that could be dangerous, it is similarly important that the system be designed in such a way as not to fool you into doing it.\nSimilarly, you probably have the right to give your life savings to some random guy. You also have the right to play tennis. Your autonomy is important; it is because of that and not in spite of it that a \"give away all my money\" button on your tennis racket would be a bad design.\nFor more information about why even administrators should use \"limited user accounts\" (plus the ability to perform any particular action without limitation, on demand), see:\n\n\n*\n\n*How to NOT become a root user? Are administrators root?\nI understand what user permissions are--they are permissions for the file's owner. What are group permissions for?\nThe owner of a file--which is usually the user who created it, or the owner of a special folder that's set up so files created it in belong to that user--can choose a group of users to \"group-own\" the file.\nThis group of users can then be given special abilities (or potentially, have special abilities taken away, though that's not generally recommended or effective) compared to everyone else.\nBy everyone else I mean all the other user accounts on your system, other than the file's owner and group-owner. This includes the ones that don't correspond to any human being. For example, you might want all the people who use your computer to be able to configure printers (lpadmin group) and use the CD/DVD/BluRay drive (cdrom group), but there's probably no need to allow the crash-reporting \"user\" (whoopsie) or the clock-syncing \"user\" (ntp) to have these abilities.\nYou can use groups to manually implement access control if you like, but on desktop systems, often most groups are automatically configured and managed. The groups command will list all the groups you're a member of.\nWhat are \"other\" permissions for?\nThey apply to everyone else--to user accounts that neither own the file nor are members of the group-owner.\nAre group and owner file permissions just for servers?\nNo, they are used to manage distinctions between different kinds of user accounts on your machine, including non-human \"user\" accounts. This applies even if there is only one human user account on your system.\nFor example, membership in the adm group (which does not make a user an administrator) confers the ability to read the contents of most systemwide log files. This is a relatively harmless ability for just about any human user of most desktop systems, but could potentially lead to problems if it were conferred to part of the system that perform only a highly specialized task (that is, it performs only that task unless something like a partially successful cyber-attack is perpetrated).\nAre group and user file permissions more important on servers than desktops?\nSort of.\nOn servers you are more likely to have to be aware of them and manage them manually, because you are more likely to deliberately provide and deny access to a variety of resources for a variety of human users.\nBut they are necessary for the system to work correctly even for a single human user. The system would have to be designed quite differently to work well in a single-user mode for everyday computing, without a system of file ownership and permissions.\nBy way of comparison, consider I/O scheduling. Many server environments have many more processes accessing many more files than many desktop systems. Therefore, input-output scheduling (managing how limited throughput can be managed to complete file access transactions with reasonable efficiency) is especially important on (some) servers, compared to (most) desktops. Server administrators are more likely to study I/O scheduling and to make changes to the way it works on their computers, than most desktop users. But I/O scheduling is necessary for either a server or desktop system work.\nAs the owner of a file, I can change all its permissions and as well as its group-owner. I can do this without sudo or a similar mechanism! So what's the point of permissions?\nThe owner of a file can do this without being root (i.e., without sudo), but other non-root users cannot. This includes the non-human \"users\" that are part of the system (see above).\nFurthermore, many files on the computer are not \"owned\" by your user account. Those files do require that you authenticate in some way, to modify their permissions. You do have to use sudo (or a similar mechanism) to change permissions on system files owned by root.\nFinally, there is some value associated with having permissions that apply only to you, even if you can change them without using sudo or any similar mechanism.\nWhat are user permissions for? Why would I want to change what I can do with a file, when I can just change it back?\nFor the same general reason you may want to make a file read-only (even though you can override it yourself), you may want to make a file that you cannot read or execute (run).\nThe more common situation is that you may not want a file you own to be executable by you. When you download something, you probably don't want it to be marked executable because it could be malware. You probably want the opportunity to consider if you want to run it, before marking it executable. Furthermore, if you downloaded a file whose name ends in .pdf but is actually a malicious program, you definitely don't want execute permissions to be set on it by default.\nThere is another reason that's less related to security. Any file marked executable is treated as something that can be run--a program or script. Most files are neither, and you would not want to be given the opportunity to run them.\nFor example, if a text file is marked executable (for example, you own it and it has the execute permission turned on for its user-owner) and you double-click on it in Nautilus (the file browser), it will run. But most text documents are not scripts, and you don't want to try to run them when you double-click on them; instead, you probably want to open them in an editor.\nIt's less common to want to create a file that you cannot yourself read (without changing its permissions back). One situation where you may want to do this is if you had several files and wanted to avoid opening one of them for a while, for example if it is huge and takes several minutes to open. I've been in this situation, where I had to keep waiting for an application to finish opening a file so I could close it because I'd selected the wrong file (again).\nA related possible scenario is if you are automatically performing some action on many files (a \"batch\" job) that reads from the files, but you want it to skip some. Provided that the action will \"degrade gracefully,\" continuing to do what it can after an error, the easiest way to accomplish it might be to mark the few files you want to skip reading as unreadable.\nA very different situation is: maybe you want to deny read permission to yourself on some file because the file serves some purpose other than containing data. Files can be used to signify some condition. As a made-up example: some search application that indexes files might first check to see if a file called noindex is present in your home folder, and stop if it finds. That file doesn't have to be read; arguably, marking it unreadable helps clarify its purpose.\nWanting to keep yourself (or some task you're performing as you) from reading files you own is not a particularly common situation, though. And in practice, most \"signal\" files (that exist because their existence itself means something) are readable by their owners. Really, as far as I am aware, there are three primary reasons for the user-owner of a file not to be able to read it, and even to be able to write to it without reading it:\n\n\n*\n\n*Group and other have read, write, and execute bits, and they can take on any combination of values. There is no compelling reason to break with this model--thereby making the system more complicated--for the user who owns the file.\n\n*Many resources that we don't usually think of as being file-like are represented by entries in the filesystem. For some resources, it makes sense to write to them, but does not make any sense to read from them. For these resources, the read bit is sometimes turned off for everyone, even the owner, and even if the owner is root. (Not always, though; for reasons that are both beyond the scope of this answer and at the edge of my own knowledge, some write-only devices' filesystem entries still have their read bits enabled for some users.)\n\n*The ability for a file to deny read access even to its owner is sometimes used to represent files on a write-only filesystem. (Not always, though; it depends on the details of the filesystem and how it is mounted.) Write-only filesystems are uncommon but they do exist and have practical uses.\n\nA: \nNormally the one who creating the file is the owner. Then who are the \"group\" and the \"other\". Is this used more for server like systems where there are many user?\n\nIn Linux, a file (or directory) can be accessed by three different \"entities\".\n\n\n*\n\n*The user (owner) of the file.\n\n*A group, which (just like the name suggests) is a group of users.\n\n*All the other people; so basically everyone else (i.e. not the owner, and not in the group).\n\n\nEach of these entities can either have read, write, and/or execution permissions on a file. See the flexibility and simplicity of Linux? Three entities, each with three different permissions. This provides a more flexible way of granting permissions to files/folders. Is this used more for server like systems where there are many user? Well, yeah okay, you can think of it that way. Your Ubuntu uses groups and others in many situations though, without you worrying about it, but I digress.\n\n\nEven if this is used for security issues, without \"$sudo\" it can be easily change to whatever wanted.\n\nIf I understand correctly, I'm guessing that you used chmod on files in your home folder, and so you did it without the need of sudo. Let's take an example:\n-rwxr-xr-x 2 alaa test 4096 Jun  5 10:02 fileName\n\nIf you want to understand what this whole line of output means, see this.\nalaa is the user (owner), and test is the group of the file.\nNow, the command you're talking about, chmod, is used to change the permissions of a file. So, let's say that I want to give write permissions to the group test, I would do the command:\nchmod g+w fileName\n\nMeaning: for the group entity (g), add (+) the write (w) permission to the file fileName.\nI, the user alaa, can do this command without needing sudo, because I'm the owner of it. If I were not the owner, I would not have been able to do this, and I would need sudo to do it.\n\n\nCan you also suggest any further reading?\n\nI suggest you, not to read about the command chmod, but to read more about the Linux/Unix File Permissions. You can visit these short pages for starters:\n\n\n*\n\n*How Linux file permissions work\n\n*Linux file permissions - 1.0\n\n*Understanding Linux File Permissions\n\nA: one of the first places for help is \"man\". You can write \"man chmod\" and you will get all information about the usage of the command. \nThe command changes the who can access the file and what he can do with that.  \"r\" stands for read, \"w\" for write, \"x\" for execute. There is a \"rwx\" tupple for each of the following categories \"owner\",\"group\", \"others\". If one category  has only read rights (\"r--\") then they can only read the file. That means open it with an editor but make no changes whatsover. With (\"rw-\") one can change the file as well. With (\"rwx\") one can also execute the file if the file is executable. Now, is it possible for a file to be able to open it in an editor and to be able execute it as well? Well, yes. If it is a binary file and you open it with an editor you will not understand a thing and if you try to execute a simple txt file with just text you will probably do nothing. However if the text is a series of commands (script file) then it can do both as well. For those files it is very important to determine the access rights as one person can change something in the commands and later this file to be executed by some one else.\nAbout the categories owner: the user that created the file. Ofcourse you can change the owner of a file with \"chown\".\ngroup: The group(s) of users the owner belonged to at the time the file was created.\nother: everyone else except the owner and the users of the same group as the owner.\n\nA: A simple web search would give plenty of results for your question. For a quick overview, I recommend you to read this.\n", "Q: Building .deb file: Copy Configurations to User Settings I'm building a deb file for my application following online tutoria and have no major problem.

Google did not help at all in this case (which might be my fault for using bad keyword). Any Idea is welcome!\n\nA: According to the Debian packaging policy we should not package files for a user's HOME directory:\n\nThe setup will differ from host to host. Therefore, no program should rely on this location.\n\nThis makes sense because a package is unaware of users on the system it is going to be installed on.\nOf course we are allowed to store our configuration files. If it were for a per-user configuration a .config/<nameofapp> directory is the appropriate place. We have to create this path from within our application.\nDefault settings templates or system wide settings may be distributed as DATA with the package. \nSystem-wide host configurations may be stored in /etc.\n", "Q: How to make ALT+TAB switcher icons smaller Is there any way to reduce the size of the default Ubuntu 13.04 window switcher icons, shown when pressing ALT+TAB?

I have a hard disk with two partitions. One used to have Windows 7 on it, the other one was recently formatted in preparation for an Ubuntu install.\nI made an Ubuntu live CD and tried to install it to the empty partition. I also took the opportunity to format the Windows partition in preparation for reinstalling Windows 7 afterwards.\nThe Ubuntu installation reported a fatal grub error and also tells me that the bootloader could not be installed.\nWhen trying to install Windows 7, the installation now also fails due to some nondescript partitioning related error.\nMy computer has effectively become unusable. Thankfully liveCD lets me try out Ubuntu.\nI have used the GParted partition editor to wipe the drive clean. How should I set up the partitions so that I can properly install both OS?\nOnce this is done, how do I fix the grub/bootloader problem?\n\nA: Since your PC uses UEFI, the starting point I'd recommend is the official Ubuntu UEFI guide. Another source of information is the question regarding Windows 8/Ubuntu Dual Boot with UEFI.\nThe main statement of these articles is, that both, Windows and Ubuntu have to be installed using the same firmware interface. This means, if you install Windows using UEFI mode (only possible with the 64bit version of Windows 7), you have to use the 64bit version of Ubuntu and boot the installer using UEFI mode. Usually, the 64bit Ubuntu CD/USB-Drive is shown twice in the boot device selection, once with UEFI, once without, the same for a 64bit Windows DVD.\n\nFor your specific question: I'd start out by creating a new partition table (warning: backup stuff first!) on the HDD  you are going to use (for instance using gparted). If you are going to use UEFI, you have to create a GPT partition table. If you plan on using BIOS mode, the partition table has to be MBR. You don't need to create partitions yet (I'd use the Windows installer to make the Windows partitions and just leave enough space for Ubuntu unpartitioned).\nAnother thing with UEFI is, that Ubuntu still has some issues with certain firmwares and therefore bootloader installation might fail on some mainboards. In such a case, I'd try to use the latest Ubuntu version and to update the firmware. If this does not help, you have to use BIOS emulation...\nIf you have a 64bit Windows 7, my suggestion would be:\n\n\n*\n\n*Create a new, empty GPT partition table on the HDD with gparted\n\n*Install Windows 7 in UEFI mode, leaving some space unpartitioned for Ubuntu (I'd say: more than 10 GB)\n\n*Install Ubuntu 64bit in UEFI mode.\n\n\nIf this works, you're fine. \nIf not, or if your Windows 7 is 32bit, then you'll probably have to use BIOS emulation.\n\n\n*\n\n*Again, create a new, empty partition table with gparted, in this case MBR.\n\n*For Windows Installation, boot the Windows DVD in BIOS/Legacy mode (see the Ubuntu UEFI guide for more details - if required, disable UEFI booting completely)\n\n*Install Ubuntu in BIOS mode (by either using the 32bit Ubuntu, or by booting from the 64bit Ubuntu DVD in Legacy/BIOS mode.\n\n\nA: Just because your motherboard has UEFI, your Windows may not have been installed in UEFI mode? Most Windows 7 systems used CSM/BIOS/Legacy mode, only a few new systems released just before Windows 8 seemed to use UEFI with Windows 7. But many systems with Intel i-series chips had UEFI/BIOS motherboards.\nDo you remember if you had an efi partition or a 100MB Boot partition used with BIOS boot mode. \nYou may need to either erase all gpt data to make drive MBR, you can use fixparts.\nFixParts is the easiest way to remove the stray GPT data. GPT fdisk (gdisk or sgdisk) can do it, but the procedure's a bit more involved.\nhttp://www.rodsbooks.com/fixparts/\nAnd if installing in BIOS mode, you need a primary partition (sda1 thru sda4), formatted NTFS with the boot flag. Some using gparted to create NTFS have had to reformat with Windows 7 and recreate active partition (boot flag).\n", "Q: Replace windows 8 with windows 7 Yesterday, I got my windows 8 BSoD on boot (reboot repeatedly) for \"system thread exception not handled\" so I can't do anything thus I installed ubuntu 12.04. still, I prefer windows for compatibilities sake...\nBut now I want to replace the windows 8 with windows 7 64bit ultimate. So, how to remove the windows 8 from my laptop using ubuntu because I still can't access windows 8 directly(still BSoD) and install windows 7 then?\n\nA: I would use GParted to format the separate disk. \nfirst you have to install GParted : \nopen a Terminal by pressing ctrl + alt + T \nThen enter the following: sudo apt-get install gparted and wait until the installation is complete.

I think you won't be asked two times.\n", "Q: Install Ubuntu on efi machine with windows 8 preinstalled (possibly remove windows 8) I read Alvarado's tutorial on how to install Ubuntu on an EFI machine with preinstalled windows 8 from Installing Ubuntu Alongside a Pre-Installed Windows with UEFI. \nThat's a nice and detailed explanation. I am about to use it. However I would like to ask some questions. Before doing this, let me describe my situation and my aims. \nI have an Asus laptop N76V with an EFI bios and a preinstalled windows 8. I could disable fast boot (in the bios and within windows 8) and secure boot. It seems that I cannot disable EFI but I could launch a CSM option. Windows still starts up correctly. \nI have two SATA drives with size 750GB each. From the partition manager in windows 8, I see the following: \nDrive 0: EFI system partition, 300 MB\n         recover partition, 600 MB\n     primary partition with OS (C:), NTFS, 372,6 GB (contains windows 8)\n     primary partition (D:), NTFS, 537,89 GB (for data)\n     recover partition, 20,01 GB\n\nDrive 1: primary partition (E:), NTFS, 465,75 GB (for data) \n     primary partition (F:), NTFS, 465,76 GB (for data)\n\nFirst aim: install Ubuntu 12.04.2 (and maybe another linux system) on the drive 1 and conserve windows 8. \nSecond aim: install Ubuntu 12.04.2 (and maybe another linux system) on the drive 1, remove windows 8 and install another linux system on the drive 0. \nFor the first aim, I could follow your advices. However I want to be sure I understood correctly. When he wrote, one should partition within windows 8, it means that one should create for instance an ext3 partition for /, a swap partition, and an ext3 partition for /home using the partition manager in windows? Then, when installing Ubuntu, choose manual partitioning, just attribute the mount point to each relevant partitions and do not format them. Is that correct?\nWhere should I put the boot loader (grub) for Ubuntu? At the beginning of the partition /? \nIn fact, I do not really want conserve Windows 8. I would prefer to erase it at the right time and to be able to partition the drives and to install several Linux systems (this is aim 2). Has anyone have hints or a reference to a tutorial for this? \n\nA: Do not create partitions with Windows partition tools. Use Windows only to shrink NTFS partitions to make room for Linux formatted partitions. Windows may convert even with gpt partitioned drives to dynamic partitioning which does not work with Linux. With gpt dynamic may also be called LDM.\nAre both drives partitioned with gpt not MBR? UEFI needs gpt partitioning to boot although Linux will boot from gpt partitioned drives in BIOS mode. Windows only boots from gpt partitioned drives with UEFI.\nWhile  system will boot only from one efi partition, with two drives it is worthwhile to manually partition and include an efi partition on every drive. Grub is installed to the efi partition of the drive you boot from. But with multiple drives, one drive can eventually fail and if you have boot loader also in other drive (and current) you can change UEFI/BIOS to boot second working drive.\nWith UEFI, grub2's bootloader is installed to the efi partition. Only with BIOS installs do you install grub2's boot loader to the MBR of the drive or sda (or sdb).\nEach system you install should create a folder in the efi partition with it boot loader. With Ubuntu and multiple installs you may only have the most current install in the ubuntu folder and use the grub menu to choose other installs.\n\nA: I can now explain to you what I did on my computer Asus laptop N76V. This answers \n(at least partially) my questions. \nKeeping permanently in mind Luis Alvarado's tutorial \n\n\n*\n\n*Installing on a Pre-Installed Windows 8 System (UEFI Supported), \n\n\nI actually followed another one, namely \n\n\n*\n\n*http://forum.ubuntu-fr.org/viewtopic.php?id=757311\nSince it is written in French, I shall sketch the main steps I did. \nThe main difference compared to the procedure proposed by Luis Alvarado consists \nin creating a new efi partition. Since oldfred recommended to create an efi partition \non each drives, I decided to create such a partition at the beginning of my second drive (Drive 1) and to choose it as location for Ubuntu's boot loader. \nBy power on I entered the bios, inserted a gparted live CD and booted on it. \nFirst I removed the boot flag appearing on the existing efi partition (on Drive 0) used \nby Windows 8. Then I erased the first partition on Drive 1 (the primary partition (E.)). In the free space, I created an efi partition of 250MB (fat32), a partition for \nUbuntu's root (ext4), a swap partition, a /home partition (ext4). I attributed the boot flag to the new efi partition. Then I restarted on Ubuntu's live CD. \nI chose a manual partitioning. I just configured and formatted the partitions \n/ and /home. I touched neither the efi nor the windows partitions. \nAccording to the tutorial, the choice of the location of the boot loader is irrelevant \nsince it will be automatically installed in the new efi partition. After that, I could restart Ubuntu without problem. However I was not able to restart Windows 8. Following \nLuis Alvarado's tutorial, I used boot-repair to cure this drawback. Now I can \nstart both OS from the new efi partition. \nThis gives an clear answer to my first question. gparted should use an existing, \nby windows created partition to prepare the partitioning used by Ubuntu, and not \ncreate partitions from an empty space on the drive. Note that this is also coherent \nwith oldfred's answer. \nConcerning my second question (on the removing of windows 8), I have no definitive \nanswer since I did not remove windows 8. However I guess I can do it without disturbing \nUbuntu’s boot loader since the latter is on the new efi partition (I saw grubx64.efi \nsomewhere under /boot/efi, where the new efi partition is mounted). I avoided in fact the case where Ubuntu uses the same efi partition as windows for boot. In that latter case, I guess it also works (as soon as you do not remove the efi partition but only windows OS). It would be nice to check this. \n", "Q: 13.04 install stops after splash screen - ata7:00: failed command: IDENTIFY PACKET DEVICE I have repeatedly tried to install 13.04 on my minitower to no avail. The installation invariably stops with a totally black screen - or frozen cursor on a black screen - after the splash screen. \nFirst, I thought it was an UEFI problem, but it didn't get better after disabling UEFI. Second, I figured it must be a problem with the graphics card, but the installation still stalled after when using nomodset, and also the acpi = off and nolapic.\nI have basically tried everything in these articles: UEFI and My computer boots to a black screen, what options do I have to fix it?. Moreover, I have checked disks and memory and found no faults, and the BIOS has been upgraded to the latest version. Both CD and USB booting has been tried.\nCould it be that installing 13.04 on this PC is actually impossible?\nNote: This PC already got Win 7 on it, but I want to erase that and replace it with Ubuntu.

The IDENTIFY PACKET DEVICE error indicates a problem with your optical drive. If that gets the system booting, you can try plugging the device back in to another port (according to online reports, like this one, the problem can sometimes go away by changing the device to another disk controller). It might also be worth trying a new cable to the optical drive. If you're lucky, a kernel update might fix the problem, too. If not, and if unplugging the optical drive works, you might try filing a bug report with Ubuntu about this.\n", "Q: I have a microsoft wireless mouse. Can I somehow see the battery status?

I honestly can't remember what I used to login to Ubuntu Forums, but I am quite sure it was OpenID. Should I be concerned?\n\nA: From  http://openid.net/\n\nWith OpenID, your password is only given to your identity provider, and that provider then confirms your identity to the websites you visit.  Other than your provider, no website ever sees your password, so you don’t need to worry about an unscrupulous or insecure website compromising your identity.\n\nThe identity provider is for instance Google and the website you visit is UF.\nSo yes you should be safe.\n\nA: Generally speaking (to the best of my knowledge, at least) when using an Open ID account to log in, the authentication is handled purely by the external website (so for example, if I were to use Facebook to log in here, the authentication would be handled purely by Facebook and not by Ask Ubuntu). The other site only hands over a unique identifier that tells the Ubuntu Forum / Ask Ubuntu / whatever that you are you, and doesn't pass on any of your login details.\nSo the passwords stored (+ hashed and salted) by the Ubuntu forum would be for local accounts only (as mentioned in the \"What we know\" section of the current maintenance page)\nOf course if you're still concerned about it, it wouldn't hurt to change your passwords - and for peace of mind it would probably be a good idea to do so anyway - but as far as I am aware unless the service you used to authenticate your Open ID was breached (Google, Facebook, etc) there shouldn't be too much cause to worry.\nSee this page on the OpenID website for further details.\n\nA: Since OpenID login is always processed on the issuer side (for example, if you use OpenID you got from Launchpad, then Forums will contact Launchpad and it is Launchpad who processes your authentication), the Forums do not keep your OpenID password (they don't need it at all).\nTherefore, all the attackers can get is your OpenID login, but not the password, since it's not actually there.\nAlso, just for completeness, according to this official announcement, only the Forums are affected, no other services are.\n\nA: If you really used OpenID: No.\nThe login process is executed between your OpenID provider and you.\nThe services that allows you to use OpenID doesn't even see your password! There is no possibility how ubuntuforums could have stored your password.\nOpenID resources\nThe following resources might help you to understand how OpenID works. \n\n\n*\n\n*A YouTube video\n\n*Wikipedia\n\n*A lot of content from Google about OpenID (The image is very good)\n\n", "Q: realtek wireless not functioning on Toshiba after installing 12.04 so like many users with a realtek wireless driver I've been having problems getting my wireless to work \nI'm on a Toshiba Satellite C875\nMy wifi adapter is RTL8188CE 802.11b/g/n\nand my kernal is 3.5.0-36-generic.\nI managed to find a post on this site with almost my exact problem and a solution, Newly installed Ubuntu on laptop, Wireless will not fuction , however, just like the poster I'm running into issues at the compiling phase.

Alright, cool...done: printf \"#!%s\" $(which bash) > $1; vim $1.

That is not always possible and sometimes extremely buggy. Install Wine from the softwarecenter. Then right click on .exe-file - open with wine.\nVirtual box installs Windows in Ubuntu and then you can install the program inside.

Apparently, there was some kind of a problem in the flash drive, and the installation didn't complete. It stopped halfway through every time I tried it. Ever since I half-installed it, every time I tried to boot Windows 7, it failed to boot. I have no GUI boot enabled, so the only indication of booting is 3 teal dashes in the upper left part of the screen. It starts booting and then suddenly the top of the screen (where those teal dashes are) becomes scrambled, like when you move around a cartridge inside an old game console.\nMy Windows XP partition works perfectly, and all my files are fine - nothing was lost. When I boot, the first thing that launches is the GNU GRUB bootloader that gives me options between Ubuntu and Windows 7. If I choose Windows 7, it gives me another boot manager (the one that I used previously to choose between XP and 7). If I choose Windows XP (listed as an \"older version of Windows\"), everything works fine. If I choose Windows 7, the problem that I mention pops up. It just stays scrambled like that no matter how much I wait.\nI tried running the repair tools. I ran the startup problem detector and it detected no problems. Someone suggested that it might be a problem with GRUB.\nAny ideas? Thanks.\nP.S: Apologies for not pointing it out, but after the USB installation failed, I managed to install Ubuntu successfully using a DVD, and I have been using it for like a month already. I have been in the mood for some games on my Win7 partition, so I decided to find a way to restore it (the Win7 itself, the files themselves are fine, as I said).\n\nA: Really a Windows issue.\nWindows can only boot thru one partition with the boot flag (or active partition in Windows). So Windows 7 installed its boot loader into your XP partition and that is what you are using to boot with. Once grub has chainloaded to the Windows boot loader, grub is not involved, so not a grub issue.\nDid you at some point resize the Windows 7 partition? Often better to use Windows tools, but the installer or gparted often works. But you need to immediately boot Windows 7, so it can run chkdsk and make its repairs to its new partition size.\nYou may just need to run chkdsk from a Windows repair console on your Windows 7 partition. Do not use XP's chkdsk for that as it will  convert partition to XP type not Windows 7 type.\n", "Q: Is there an app for keyboard status I have a brand new laptop, well it's only 3 weeks old, so nearly brand new. The only problem I find with it is that there is no visual display, light or sound, fitted to tell me whether the Caps Lock key is on or off. This is Packard Bell's way of why I didn't want to buy from them in the past!!!\nIs there any software which would display the status of the Caps Lock key?\nI have searched through the Software Centre for Caps Lock, keyboard status and installed KeyMon but it didn't work.

If you run the setup again, from your flash drive, and repair the current installation. It should cure your problems, although, you may need to reinstall if a repair doesn't fix it.\nI could be talking a load of nonsense as I have not had any problems with booting, so check first that there are not any better looking at posts like Can't boot without Flash Drive plugged in \n", "Q: How do I make a PC .local instead of IP?

Also the Ubuntu SDK documentation seems to cover only UI-related topics.\nIs there a method to access the full user name from within a QML app? And in general, are system APIs or the Unity API available to QML apps?\n\nA: For that you need to create your own QML plugin what is a simple Qt/C++ code.

Is this possible to do without modifying the Steam's code? Because it reports that the non-native game is not for the system if you attempt to launch it. This would be really great for while we're waiting for more games to be ported, as then we would not actually have to install 2 separate clients on the machine. Thanks!\n\nA: I realise that this is only a partial answer, but it's possible to add non-Steam games to Steam.  This means that all of your games are listed in one place, and that you can use the shift-tab Steam overlay in game, but has the drawback that these games will not be installable through Steam nor automatically updated.\nMethod:\n\n\n*\n\n*Install the game outside of Steam for Linux.\n\n*Create a .desktop file for the game if it does not already have one.  In this example, I have installed War Thunder with Steam for Windows, rebooted into Linux, and placed the following in ~/.local/share/applications/war-thunder.desktop:\n[Desktop Entry]\nName=War Thunder\nComment=Multiplayer online combat flight simulator\nExec=wine \"/run/media/mavit/Windows7_OS/Program Files (x86)/Steam/steamapps/common/War Thunder/launcher.exe\"\nType=Application\nCategories=Game\nPath=/run/media/mavit/Windows7_OS/Program Files (x86)/Steam/steamapps/common/War Thunder\nIcon=/run/media/mavit/Windows7_OS/Program Files (x86)/Steam/steamapps/common/War Thunder/icon.ico\n\n\n*In Steam for Linux, select Games→Add a Non-Steam Game to My Library..., and add the game.\n\n*If you find that the game will not start, right click on it in Steam for Linux, select Properties, and check that the details are correct, editing Target and Start In to match Exec and Path respectively in the .desktop file above.\n\n\nA: *\n\n*Install PlayOnLinux here:\nhttp://www.playonlinux.com/en/download.html\n\n*Press the Super (Windows) key and type in 'PlayOnLinux' and press Enter.\n\n*Press the 'Install' + button at the top.\n\n*Search for 'Steam', double-click on it and follow the install instructions.\n\n*Comment if you have any problems :D\n(Note that this probably won't run perfectly because POL uses WINE which is only a Windows compatibility layer)\n[Other answers to similar questions recommend WINE which isn't as user-friendly or as flexible as PlayOnLinux in my opinion]\n", "Q: Installing crunchbang (grub) alongside WUBI Is it possible to dual-boot with Ubuntu 12.04, Windows 7, and crunchbang? I have Ubuntu installed with WUBI, so there is a virtual drive inside my C:/ drive. If I were to install crunchbang normally in a partition, would it interfere with WUBI, since crunchbang uses grub?\n\nA: Wubi is not visible to other bootloaders. It's managed by the Windows boot manager, so you can install anything you like.\nWhen you install another OS using e.g. Grub, it will add an entry for the new OS and Windows. When you select Windows you'll get the option to boot Wubi. \nWubi also runs Grub and when you update its grub.cfg i.e. by running sudo update-grub (or from a package update trigger) it will see the other OS. Then you'll find the Wubi Grub menu starts to appear (it's suppressed by default) and it will show the new OS in it (not Windows, which is automatically removed).\nHow does Grub find the Wubi install when running Wubi, but not when running a normal install? There is a package lupin-support which adds a script /etc/grub.d/10_lupin and this adds entries for Wubi. You can still boot a Wubi install from a normal Grub on your new OS, but you'd have to manually add the entries for it (not hard since you can just copy them from the Wubi install's grub.cfg to the other installs /etc/grub.d/40_custom)\n", "Q: Ubuntu on a Windows ME PC Will Ubuntu ore Lubuntu work on my old Windows ME PC, or will I have to try an older edition of L/Ubuntu -If so what version?\n\nA: Try Lubuntu 13.04 32-bit or Ubuntu GNOME 13.04 32-bit, if they don't work, you probably need something called a non-PAE kernal, so install Lubuntu 12.04 32-bit and then run the following commands in a Terminal (press Ctrl + Alt + T):\nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:prof7bit/fake-pae\nsudo do-release-upgrade\nsudo do-release-upgrade\n\nThat should upgrade you to Lubuntu 13.04. You can then install Ubuntu GNOME for 'fuller' Ubuntu experience (it has the Ubuntu system tray in the top-right).\nsudo apt-get install gnome\n\nTo remove Lubuntu:\nsudo apt-get remove lubuntu-desktop\n\n\nA: If your old system hardware is supported by Ubuntu then you should be able to install it without any issue.\nLook at here for 13.04 Or here for 12.04 Or here for 10.04 system requirements \nAll links are for x86 systems, which I would guess is yours\n", "Q: Use path bar and address bar in Nautilus By default, Nautilus use/show the path bar:\n\n\nUsing Ubuntu Tweak I managed to set by default the address bar:\n\n\nIs it possible to set both of them as default (show both: the buttons and the text input)?\nNote: I know that I can use Ctrl+L to switch between them, so I'm not interested about this.\n\nA: Whilst I don't know if at all possible in Nautilus, I beleive Thunar may serve your wishes. It shows the button bar by default, but pressing Ctrl+L will result in the text bar popping out as shown below, allowing you to copy/paste or change directory by typing. When you press enter it goes away and you have the button bar. You have the best of both worlds.\n\nIn my opinion Thunar is \"quicker\" than nautilus but have no figures to back this up. It has an incredibly simple look and interface which I prefer.\n\nA: No, it is not possible to do so.\nThe reasoning of \"is it really not possible to do so\" might be uninteresting, but I can say something about why it isn't, and probably shouldn't be, possible.\nFair warning: the answer is wordy. Its lengthy, but I believe its sensible. While I highly recommend that you do read on, feel free to not read on.\n\n\n*\n\n*The design of nautilus: Having an option to display both would require disproportionate vertical widening of the icons area, as now there would be two lines required to display the pathbar as well as address bar. But then other buttons on the right would have slack space above and below them, unless they readjust themselves, which is again a big design question by itself.\n\n*The aesthetics of nautilus: Having both pathbar and address bar would be awfully ugly to see.\n\n*Most people, and I mean barring a handful of exceptions like you and me, people have preference for either. Its a clear choice for them. Having an option to \"tweak\" this would mean cluttering the preferences section of nautilus, again to no avail. In fact, in the recent version, you can see that a lot of configuration and menu options have been removed, or hidden to make the overall experience of the nautilus very very simple.\n\n*Wastage of screen real-estate: You would require only either of them at any point. This is true even if you are a person who use both of them multiple times throughout the day. You would want just either of them at any time, and it just makes sense, even from your point of view, to actually press Ctrl + L when you want the access to the other thing. Seeing the unrequired alternative on the screen would clutter the thinking process too.\n\nA: I am not sure whether you prefer only nautilus, but I am writing in a hope that you would like this. You have helped me many times hope I'll return the same at least once.\nXFE can display the path bar and address bar in much better way.

Install dconf-tools and launch dconf-editor:\n$ sudo apt-get install --yes dconf-tools\n$ dconf-editor\n\nThen navigate to org > gnome > nautilus > preferences and check always-use-location-entry.\n\nA: First install dconf-tools\nsudo apt-get install dconf-tools\n\nAfter installation open dconf-editor go to org –> gnome –> nautilus –> preferences and choose always-use-location-entry\n\n\nA: A possible solution would be to install nautilus-terminal, which embed a terminal in the nautilus window, so you could enter the desired path with cd.\nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:flozz/flozz\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get install nautilus-terminal\n\n\nA: Consider using gnome-commander -- there you have what you are asking for, and a bunch of other things.

Later on I decided to dual install Windows 7. I opened up GParterd and created a partition for Windows 7 and formatted it at NTSF. Well, when I try to install Windows 7, it doesn't recognized the NTSF partition. It states that all the partitions are GPT file format. Even though I have gone in and reformatted that partition several times as NTSF, Windows 7 still won't recognize it at anything other than GPT file system. I even used a Gparted lived CD to format that partition as well. How do I format the partition in NTSF where Windows 7 will recognize it as such and install onto it?\n\nA: gpt is not a format, but a type of partitioning. Windows only boots from gpt partitioned drives with UEFI. Ubuntu will boot either with UEFI or BIOS from gpt partitioned drives.\nYou may be able to convert, if partitioning is within certain MBR rules, so you then can boot with BIOS. Or if system is dual UEFI/BIOS you have to convert your Windows install to a flash drive and add the UEFI capability.\nConverting to or from GPT\nhttp://www.rodsbooks.com/gdisk/mbr2gpt.html\nYou then need to use gdisk to convert from gpt to MBR\nhttp://www.rodsbooks.com/gdisk/mbr2gpt.html#gpt2mbr\n", "Q: Xubuntu, no battery detected Recently I installed Xubuntu on my old Latitude D620.

It won't know about or care about the Mint4Win install that you have.\nYou cannot use Wubi as it shares some key files with Mint4Win e.g. C:\\wubildr.mbr and more importantly C:\\wubildr, which is the boot file that directs you to either \\ubuntu\\disks\\root.disk or the Mint4Win equivalent. It can only boot one or the other, so you'd have to manually swap it out, or alternatively add manual Grub entries in one of the Wubi or Mint4Win installs to boot the other (more pain than it's worth).\n", "Q: Newbie: Ubuntu One: struggling with the Sync This is my first attempt at using a Linux based OS.\nI signed up using Ubuntu One, I then logged into the Ubuntu One cloud site.

If you open your home folder (profile directory on Windows), the folder you're looking for should be underneath the Ubuntu One folder, within that directory.\nAlso, you should stop synchronization of the .local/share/ubuntuone/shares folder. It is a special folder that contains all the folders which have been shared to you by other users, so synchronizing it will duplicate all those files into your own account's storage, and take up your available storage quota. It will also waste your bandwidth by downloading everything and then duplicating things once they've downloaded.\n", "Q: how to make Wine GUI elements look like modern Windows elements I started using Wine to run Windows apps on Ubuntu, but I see that the style of User Interface elements like buttons etc. is too old, like the buttons of windows 98, is there a way to make it like Windows 7 or 8??\n\nA: I don't have the EXACT details, but when you do \"winecfg\" there is an option for \"Themes\" under one of the tabs.  If you can get yourself to an XP or Win 7 Machine, go into c:/windows/resources (or it might be /system32/resources/) and you will find a msstyles folder or files.  You need to copy those items.

On this server, I have installed and run postfix with courier-imap.  It works great, but I need to expand it's folder options for better record keeping.  Whenever I try to make a new folder, I just get subdirectories of INBOX.  \nI found this article, but it was no help:\nhttp://www.courier-mta.org/FAQ.html#namespace\nI understand that INBOX can't be changed.  I want to make another directory on the same level as INBOX, not as a subdirectory. From what I gather from the FAQ, courier says that it's not courier's fault!  is it possible to make another root level directory?\nI tried moving to dovecot, but that had it's own host of issues.\nThanks,\nP\n\nA: I figured out dovecot.  Courier is ultra reliable, but the whole \"everything has to be a sub directory of INBOX\" issue is just too much. \n\nA: As of 2021, Courier still forces one INBOX namespace and no possiblity to create other namespaces such as Sent, Drafts, Junk, Trash, ... Everything still has to be a sub directory of INBOX.\n\nIf OUTBOX is defined, mail can be sent via the IMAP connection by copying\na message to the INBOX.Outbox folder.  For all practical matters,\nINBOX.Outbox looks and behaves just like any other IMAP folder.

I want the entire drive backed up because I want to make sure I have all data and config files saved if I need them again because Im going to reinstall my computer. Can anyone help me out?\n\nA: Not possible with a full backup of Ubuntu. Windows only reads Windows formatted partitions like NTFS or FAT32, but those formats do not support ownership & permissions which are required for Linux.\nYou can copy data files like photos, music or text to NTFS as ownership or permissions are not critical and can be easily reset when copied back into a new Linux install.\nBut if a full backup you need all of /home, possibly some of /etc if you changed any system or hardware configurations and export a list of installed applications to make it easy to reinstall. Some other applications may have data in other locations such as sql or other server type data.\nYou can use many tools to copy data, in uncompressed format or others in compressed formats that need others tools to read.

Ubuntu itself cannot be installed on a FAT or a NTFS partition and the installer will help you select either unpartitioned space or reduce your NTFS partition to allow for a Ubuntu system to be installed alongside of whatever you have already installed. \nYou may access you files on any FAT or NTFS partitions from Ubuntu after installation given that you didn't choose to destroy it in the installation process.\nPS: If you already have Ubuntu installed the recommended way of upgrading is with update-manager.

I've been using Windows 8 as my laptop since it came out, though I hate it, I really didn't really have a choice since my school only allowed Windows, and since my mom bought me windows 8, I just put it on. I've used Linux since the summer of 2012 so I'm still a bit of a newbie. I use Linux a lot, much more than windows, it's just that I run Linux on virtual machines so I can get the Linux experience, and since I have 8 gigs of RAM, I can spare about 5 for the virtual machines. My main Linux distros are Arch, Ubuntu, and Mint. Though I use Arch the most because I love the customization it offers because I'm a diy kind of guy. And since my laptop crashed because windows experienced a problem and restored everything, I'm thinking of installing linux on my computer, so I have to choose a distro to download, I can't really decide which to put on. I really like Linux Mint because it's simple and uses apt-get, but I don't like MATE or cinnamon because of their simple interfaces. I like Fedora because its always on the latest software, but yum is a bit too slow. I like Arch becuase it has a really fast boot up, pacman is awesome,almost all packages are vanilla, but I don't like that it doesn't have defaults, but I'm probably still going to install it.

I suggest a 64 bit version of the OS if possible, since your computer can easily support it.  \nHeres some websites with good in-depth evaluations of different Linux distrobutions.\nhttp://www.techradar.com/news/software/operating-systems/best-linux-distro-five-we-recommend-1090058\nhttp://www.pcpro.co.uk/features/382288/best-linux-distros-for-2013\n\nA: Whatever you choose, I would keep in mind that pretty much any distro can be customized to your liking. For instance, if you don't like Mint's desktops, you could install something else, such as KDE.\nPersonally I would choose Ubuntu, simply because I like the simple apt-get method of installing software, and have had too many recent problems with Mint 15.

The VM booted up from virtual CD and went through the install just fine. But at this final stage the thing hangs. I have \"force shutdowned\" the VM and then rebooted, but on occasion I get an error like \"broken pipe\" and frankly I do not want to deal with the possibility of a 99% completed OS install where there's some slim chance of some catastrophic system error occurring at some point, hosing my system. However, reassurances would be welcome... \n-Adam\n\nA: You can safely do an \"unclean shutdown\" (either close the window and choose \"Power off the machine\", or click the \"Machine\" menu and then \"Close\"), because the filesystems are unmounted. When a filesystem is unmounted, you're sure that there's nothing left to be written.\n", "Q: Installed 12.04 dual boot with 10.04, fails to boot 10.04 I installed 12.04 alongside of 10.04 this evening, not an upgrade, just a side by side install. After doing a few updates, I re-booted to access 10.04. Scrolled down in the grub menu and selected the 10.04 and pressed enter.\nGot a page with several lines and what stood out was:\nTarget file system does not have /sbin/init\n\nthen a prompt with:\n(initramfs)\n\nI've come across several posts around the net with booting to a live CD and trying to fix the hard drive to running a few script files to fix the problem. Is there a single point solution to repair this?\nJohn\n\n\nA: I did some more digging and came across a blog that stated if the partition started on zero instead of one, it is possible that it could cause similar symptoms as this. It recommended running Gparted to correct the issue. I located my system rescue CD (downloadable from System Rescue CD) and ran it. Accessed Gparted. The partition that would not boot was starting at zero so I reduced the size of the partition by one meg, started the partition at one and initiated the action. Because this was an almost 300 gig sized partition, it took about 6 hours for it to complete. After it finished, I rebooted the computer and on the grub screen, I chose the partition I had problems accessing from before and it booted as designed. \nProblem solved.\n", "Q: Installed as a dual boot ubuntu 13.04 alongside win8 and no grub? i previously had windows 7 on my machine when i bought it i installed win8 now but i wanted to try out ubuntu so i installed alongside win8 but there was no grub screen to choose ubuntu.. if anyone knows of a way to fix this please let me know !!

I have been running Lubuntu 13.04 with the Wifi working fine for a couple weeks until today, when the connection broke and was never able to reconnect successfully.\nThe router is a motorola gateway combo which I'm currently connected to wirelessly via my windows 7 laptop--no problems with it as far as I can discern.\nPerhaps importantly the problem seemed to disappear when I disabled the WPA2-PSK AES encryption from the router and I was able to connect the Lubuntu machine to the Wifi, but then I decided to test that 'solution' by manually disconnecting and reconnecting via NetworkManager. When I attempted to reconnect to the unsecured wireless, NetworkManager prompted me for a password. Weird.  \nMy problem is very similar to Why can't my Wifi connect or disconnect? except it's occuring in Lubuntu 13.04.\nWhen I dmesg | grep wlan0\nI get a series of messages like this in a loop (i'm not sure where the loop begins, assuming the driver messages are the end):\nwlan0: associate with [router mac address] (try 1/3)\nwlan0: RX AssocResp from [router mac address] (capab=0x411 status=0 aid=5)\nwlan0: associated\nwlan0: authenticate with [router mac address]\nwlan0: send auth to [mac address] (try 1/3)\nwlan0: authenticated\nrt73usb 1-8:1.0 wlan0: disabling HT as WMM/QoS is not supported by the AP\nrt73usb 1-8:1.0 wlan0: disabling VHT as WMM/QoS is not supported by the AP\n\nNOTES: The messages beginning 'rt73usb' began after the problem at hand; 'rt73usb' is the name of the wireless driver\niwconfig yields\nwlan0    IEEE802.11bg ESSID:off/any\n         Mode: Managed Access-Point: Not-Associated Tx-Power=20 dBm\n         Retry long limit:7 RTS thr:off   Fragment thr:off\n         Power Management: off\n\nsudo lshw -c network yields\ndescription: Wireless interface\nphysical id: 1\nbus info: usb@1:8\nlogical name: wlan0\nserial:[mac address]\ncapabilities: ethernet physical wireless\nconfiguration: broadcast=yes driver=rt73usb driverversion=3.8.0-26-generic \\\nfirmware=1.7 link=no multicast=yes wireless=IEEE 802.11bg\n\nA really strange aspect of this problem is that, as far as I could tell, I had not updated any software packages for hours leading up to the connection problem.\nThings I have tried already: \n1)soft blocking wifi with rfkill block wifi and restarting the network-manager service with service network-manager restart\n2)rebooting\n3)killing wpa_supplicant and network-manager\n4)I attempted to remove NetworkManager via aptitude to replace with wicd, but was informed that lubuntu-desktop 'depends' on network-manager {@!#$#@!}\n5)As mentioned before, I disabled WPA2-PSK AES encryption in the router and seemed to make some headway, but could not reconnect after a manual disconnect.\n6)I checked /var/log/apt/history.log to see what software changes had been made but the problem started today(7.24.2013) and history.log just has a Start-Date and End-Date with the same date/time stamp.\nDoes anyone have any ideas as to what could have caused this? Has anyone successfully removed Network Manager from lubuntu and replaced it?  \n\nA: Removing Network Manager is tricky and can be done but I doubt it is the problem. I also recommend you use WPA2 and AES encryption. Do not use, if you have the option, any mixed mode WPA and WPA2 mode.\nI'd suggest you power cycle the router; that is, unplug the power, wait a few moments and plug it back in. Let the router boot and obtain an IP address from your internet service provider. Reboot your computer. Can you connect now? If not, let's try a driver parameter:\nsudo modprobe -r rt73usb\nsudo modprobe rt73usb nohwcrypt=1\n\nNow can you connect? If so, let's make it persistent:\ngksudo gedit /etc/modprobe.d/rt73usb.conf\n\nAdd a single line:\noptions rt73usb nohwcrypt=1\n\nProofread carefully, save and close gedit. Do NOT make this change and write this file unless you learn, from the steps above, that it makes it possible to connect. \nIf none of these steps help, update the driver by downloading this file to your desktop: http://www.kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/projects/backports/stable/v3.10/backports-3.10-2.tar.bz2 Right-click it and select 'Extract Here.'\nGet a temporary wired ethernet connection and do:\nsudo apt-get install linux-headers-generic build-essential\ncd Desktop/backports-3.10-2/\nmake defconfig-wifi\nmake\nsudo make install\n\nThe compile process takes a few minutes, so please be patient. Now unload the old driver and load the newest:\nsudo modprobe -r rt73usb\nsudo modprobe rt73usb\n\nNow can you connect?\n", "Q: new file default execution permission? I can't figure out why I don't have execution permissions on files I create by default.\nI don't think I messed with any Ubuntu permissions, it's pretty default stuff.\nWhen doing some research I found out about a thing called umask, running umask returns 0002 I don't think that's the problem.

I really like the wine, a complete .exe emulator.\nBut I would like to use an Mac OS X theme, so, I would like to use the \"Made for Mac\" programs.\nWhere can I download this emulator - if it exists?\nThanks\nGabriel\n\nA: Yes there is a  compatibility layer that can run Macintosh binaries On Linux and it is called Darling.  You can get it by this command in the terminal (Note this is only for the source code)\ngit clone --recursive git://github.com/LubosD/darling.git\n\nand you need you compile it also, where is link telling you how http://darling.dolezel.info/en/Build.\nNote this project is early in development, there aren't many Apple programs that can run on this compatibility layer.  There is more Apple programs that can  run on Darwin OS than this compatibility layer that said I think you will be better off running Darwin in a VM!.\n\nSources:\nhttp://darling.dolezel.info/en/Download\nhttp://www.phoronix.com/scan.php?page=news_item&px=MTI0Njc\n\nA: I think there is no \"emulator\", as there are for example nes-emulators. Also, Wine isn't really an emulator. \nSo, I think the best solution for you would be virtualbox, a program which allows you to install several other OSs in Ubuntu. Install it from the softwarecenter. Open it and put the OSX-DVD in your mashine (This is the only non-free part of this solution). Create -New- and follow the wizard. Your operating system will be installed and you can use it inside Ubuntu, as if it was on a separate computer. Everything inside a window, a little Mac.\n", "Q: How does Linux know how to execute shell vs machine code? ./something\n\nHow does Linux know how to execute this if it's a shell script, or compiled machine code?

The only thing I could think of is:\n\n\n*\n\n*Checking if it is a server issue relating to the website's server itself.  But it sounds like wit's widespread so this may not be the case.\n\n*Reinstall your internet drivers.  That may fix the issue although only do this if you know how to.  \n\n*From a quick glance it looks like the servers are having issues.

I did the default during the install, and wondering in case I ever needed to allocate more.\n\nA: If you used LVM then you can add directly to the volume group and then logical volume in turn.\nIf you didn't use LVM, you can mount the new space in an existing directory. This will make the space available under that directory, but won't expand the space it has been mounted onto.\n", "Q: \"ImportError: No module named _struct\" configuring python-minimal When I run sudo apt-get upgrade, the dpkg error appears and interupts the process.\nError details:\nSetting up python-minimal (2.7.3-0ubuntu7.1) ...\nTraceback (most recent call last):\n  File \"/usr/local/lib/python2.7/runpy.py\", line 162, in _run_module_as_main\n    \"__main__\", fname, loader, pkg_name)\n  File \"/usr/local/lib/python2.7/runpy.py\", line 72, in _run_code\n    exec code in run_globals\n  File \"/usr/local/lib/python2.7/compileall.py\", line 16, in <module>\n    import struct\n  File \"/usr/local/lib/python2.7/struct.py\", line 1, in <module>\n    from _struct import *\nImportError: No module named _struct\ndpkg: error processing python-minimal (--configure):\n subprocess installed post-installation script returned error exit status 255\ndpkg: dependency problems prevent configuration of python:\n python depends on python-minimal (= 2.7.3-0ubuntu7.1); however:\n  Package python-minimal is not configured yet.\n\nAnd this problem leads to a series of dependency problems when processing the following packages: \n python\n gwibber-service\n libgwibber3\n libgwibber-gtk3\n gwibber\n gwibber-service-facebook\n gwibber-service-identica\n gwibber-service-twitter\n python-all\n python-dev\n python-all-dev\n python-apt\n python-problem-report\n python-apport\n python-libxml2\n unity-lens-gwibber\n unity-scope-video-remote\n\nFinally, nothing I can do for this problem.

I just saw the video about Chromecast and I am interested in knowing how can I enable this on my Ubuntu PC. My TV has an HDMI port.\n\nA: The documentation from Google indicates that the Google Cast extension is not supported in Linux, but it actually does work.\nTo get this working in Ubuntu:\n\n\n*\n\n*Make sure you are running either Chromium or Chrome version 28 or higher.  Earlier versions will get a \"This application is not supported on this computer. Installation has been disabled.\" error.  The 'chromium-browser' package in Ubuntu 13.04 works fine.\n\n*Make sure iptables is configured to allow the UPnP/SSDP traffic used by the Google Cast browser extension to discover the ChromeCast device.\nThe browser will send a multicast UDP packet from the local IP and an ephemeral (random) port to 239.255.255.250 port 1900.  The ChromeCast device will respond with a unicast UDP packet from the ChromeCast device's IP and another ephemeral port to the source IP/port of the multicast packet.  Note that this is slightly different than most other UPnP devices, which will usually respond with a unicast UDP packet from port 1900 instead of an ephemeral port.\nThe typical iptables -A INPUT -m state --state ESTABLISHED,RELATED -j ACCEPT rule WILL NOT match the response packet, as iptables does not currently have a conntrack helper that supports SSDP.  In addition, the iptables -A INPUT -p udp --sport 1900 -j ACCEPT rule typically used for UPnP/SSDP will not work since the replies from the ChromeCast device do not come from port 1900.\nTherefore, you will need to add a rule to accept UDP packets on all ephemeral ports.  The ephemeral port range for the initial multicast packet should be 32768-61000 (Verify with cat /proc/sys/net/ipv4/ip_local_port_range), so the following rule should work (note it inserts at the top of the input rules):\niptables -I INPUT -p udp -m udp --dport 32768:61000 -j ACCEPT\nAfter the ChromeCast device has been discovered (each time the browser starts), the browser will control it using TCP (HTTP) connections to port 8008, which should not require any special iptables rules.\n\n*Install the Google Cast browser extension in either Chromium or Chrome.  Note that an app/extension called ChromeCast is available, but this is not what you want.\n\n*If you have not yet set up your ChromeCast device, follow the instructions that come with the device to set it up.\n\n*Once your device is configured, you should be able to simply click the Cast button in Chromium to Cast your current tab.\n\nA: Since this question was asked 2 years ago, it may be worth mentioning that after Feb 2016, on Xubuntu 15.10, it was as easy as:\n\n\n*\n\n*Install Chrome or Chromium for Linux\n\n*Install the Google Cast browser extension from within Chrome\n\n\nCast the tab you want. Easy as that. \nEDIT: Now the feature is built in:\n\n\nA: I'm running Ubuntu 14.04 on my PC & Android 4.3 on my Phone. \nFirst you need to plug the Chromecast in and change the TV source to that HDMI port.\nNext install the Phone app from here on play store\nThen use the Phone app to connect the Chromecast to your wifi and then it will update and reboot. \nAfter that, go to your Ubuntu PC and open Chromium and install this app from the Chrome web store\nThe Chrome-cast device is now listed. It's that simple.\nFor video file playback : Go to File > Open File  locate the video and open. The Chromium browser has a media player built in. Then you can stream it.

I want to keep the data on those partitions which include my all important data.\nIs there a way of doing clean installation of Ubuntu without losing data on Windows partitions?\nWhat happens if I move all my data into one Windows partition (Assume to last Windows partition i.e E:) and then format all other four Windows partitions (Then Ubuntu advance partition menu will identify this total space as a free space) and use advance partition menu to create /boot, /, /home and swap area?\nWill I be able to extend or merge that Windows E: partition to my Ubuntu home partition after I boot into Ubuntu?\nWhat other types of partitions that we can have in Ubuntu if we want to keep our Movies, Personnel Documents and Study materials in each separate partitions? (Like i did in Windows)\n\nA: If you have 5 partitions with Windows is the extra partition a logical partition in an extended partition, or did you have Windows convert to dynamic partitions. Dynamic partitions do not work with Linux.\nOnly if you have Windows should you keep a NTFS partition as a data partition. It will need chkdsk on occassion and Linux cannot run that. Linux normally runs fsck on Linux partitions every 40 to 60 reboots automatically.\nYou can create Linux formatted (ext4 typically) partitions for data if you desire. While you can manually mount with Nautilus each time you reboot, it usually is better to add permanent settings to fstab. You then have to create your own mount points but you can give names that make sense like data, Movies, Music instead of E: or F:. You also have to set ownership & permissions.\nhttp://www.psychocats.net/ubuntu/mountlinux\nhttps://help.ubuntu.com/community/Mount/\nhttps://help.ubuntu.com/community/FilePermissions\nhttps://help.ubuntu.com/community/Fstab\n\nA: This question passes by every so often.

I would keep two backups of my data (windows partition included) and then do a typical ubuntu install which removes everything. Then you make a new home partition and use something else that ntfs for it.\n\nA: If you have moved all your data to partition \"E\", you can format the partitions, but let the \"E\" remain the same in NTFS when you install the Ubuntu. \nYour data will remain in partition \"E\" after installing Ubuntu. \nI'm not sure if you will need to automount that partition, but in that case open the terminal and run:\nsudo apt-get install ntfs-config  \nsudo mkdir -p /etc/hal/fdi/policy  \n\nMaybe you can check a \"To do list after installing Ubuntu\" for additional configurations.\n", "Q: How to load a apllication to the memory using shell scripting?

I just installed Ubuntu 12.04 LTS and was very surprised (and amused :)) about the install-window showing the status information:\n\n\"Zusatzpakete werden entfernt\"\n\n(means something like \"removing additional packages\")\nSeems very weird to me that in an installation, additional packages are removed...why have they been installed in first place?\nWell, not that bad, i used Windows for decades now, i just had the small hope that the linux world would be a little bit saner ;D\n\nA: Though there can be several reason, I think those packages were removed as they are unneeded now. They are installed because they were on the installation media. Now new updates came in and mark those item as not required. So ubuntu is removing it.\nAnother reason could be, for installation purpose ubuntu installed some packages  which are not used for normal day to day usage. So it is cleaning them up.\n\nA: There are packages present on the Live CD image which may get uninstalled after the image is copied to your hard drive. One example I can think of is gparted, it is present on the Live CD session but not available on a newly installed system. Other packages that this occurs with are usually filesystem related, for example LVM is present on the Live CD in case you want to use LVM partitioning on your installation. If you don't use this then there is no reason to have the LVM package on your installed system so it is removed. I think that the unused language packs get removed as well.\n\nA: TLDR; It's basically just a apt-get autoremove performed after installation.\nHere's what happens on installation time using a desktop installer (this answer is not valid for server or alternate installers):\n\n\n*\n\n*A sort of preinstalled Ubuntu image (/casper/filesystem.squashfs on the CD) is extracted onto your hard drive. It's like taking a shortcut, because it's all in a predefined state and does not require all packages to be installed one by one (opposed to the debootstrap process in the server/alternate installers).\n\n*After extraction of the image, the installer chroots into the target and will apply all changes you entered during installation: user account, language, timezone, etc. It will then also apply updates.\n\n*The state of the target filesystem (almost finished installation) after all this will probably result in some packages not needed for your system. E.g. older kernel that is not applicable anymore due to updates, or you didn't choose to use LVM so all packages related to that can be removed. (this is just hypothetical - I did not check if this actually performs the removal of LVM.) It's not much different from applying a large stack of package updates that result in some packages removed using apt-get autoremove.\n\n", "Q: Dual boot for a windows 8 laptop I'm trying to dual boot my laptop with windows 8 and linux.

Also if you try playing a media file that you don't have the codec for then you should get asked if you want to download it automatically.\nAnother option is to install VLC to play your media files, this doesn't need any extra codec packages installed as they are already built into the player itself.\n\nA: On Ubuntu exist different multimedia frameworks/libraries with a different codec systems. The default applications on Ubuntu all use gstreamer. Codecs for gstreamer are implemented as plugins and can be found in software center (or synaptic, which is probably easier to use for technical packages) under the name gstreamer-plugins-(something). \nOther often encountered multimedia libraries or -interfaces (calling them frameworks would probably be exaggerated) apart from gstreamer are offered by xine, ffmpeg, vlc, mplayer,... which all make use of libavcodec and therefore can handle nearly all widely used audio- and video encodings without the need for any additional codecs.\nIn addition to these, many codecs are available as shared libraries, that might be used by programs. Examples are xvid or x264. Usually these libraries are linked at compile time, so they will be installed automatically as a dependecy, when a program is installed that uses them. Most of these codecs are not required for playback, since libavcodec can handle files created with them (and at least in the case of xvid is also faster). They can be required or give advantages for encoding.\nIf you are looking for a powerful encoder, have a look at ffmpeg and mencoder - both support a wide variety of codecs. The mencoder documentation is a good starting point for anyone working with video, since it gives many often ignored but important details about MPEG codecs that help to achieve good quality.\n", "Q: Will the Ubuntu Edge work in countries without LTE?

Read here - How do I install additional drivers? \nUbuntu installed via wubi is always slow.\nSince the whole ubuntu content is put in packaged format and stored in the hdd, a low speed HDD contributes more slowness to the system.\nFor using ubuntu you don't need to remove windows. You can perfectly dual boot it, jsut like you are doing with wubi.\nIf the system is slow, after trying both you can look for a lighter ubuntu based distro like lubuntu or xubuntu. Read more here - How do I find out which version and derivative of Ubuntu is right for my hardware in terms of minimal system requirements?\nFor installing ubuntu on a separate partition and dual boot with windows.

How can I re-partition?\n\nA: You can use e.g. GParted partitoning program to resize your partitions. But you can't just simply resize mounted partitions, so boot up a Live CD, install GParted with\nsudo apt-get install gparted\n\nStart gparted and resize your partitions.\n\nA: well there is a good reason for such partition process.I will explain them as my level best.\nswap :  swap partitions are used to support virtual memory. In other words, data is written to a swap partition when there is not enough RAM to store the data your system is processing. That can speed up processing of data (usually swap recommended to give twice of your RAM)\n/boot : /boot/ contains the operating system kernel (which allows your system to boot), along with files used during the bootstrap process. For most users, a 250 MB boot partition is sufficient.\n/usr  : The /usr directory holds the majority of software content on Linux system. For an installation of the default set of software, allocate at least 4 GB of space. If you are a software developer or something who deals with huge sized applications and space then you'd better to go for extension of space. \nbut there is a problem with separate /usr partition that is the boot process becomes much more complex, and in some situations (like installations on iSCSI drives), might not work at all.\nIf you would like to know more about partition schemes then I suggest you to must read this : http://tldp.org/LDP/intro-linux/html/sect_03_01.html\nIf you shrink the size of those partitions then you can do that from gparted which you can install from either software center & terminal.\nfrom terminal sudo apt-get install gparted\nIf you would like to shrink the size of the partition , just open gparted and then select the partition with right-click but as I know you cant do it from installed system . you must do it from live system .  \n", "Q: Are there any tablets that support ubuntu?

If your programs are written accordingly, several computers can work together on the same problem using Message Passing Interface. Often MPI is  combined with a scheduling tool (for instance PBS) to launch the MPI-aware application on several nodes in a controlled manner. In such a configuration each node is still an individual computer and can (in principle) be used independently of the rest.\nEdit: I just found a setup guide for an mpich cluster with Ubuntu.\n", "Q: Would like to have Windows back So i tried to install Ubuntu, it wasnt going wery well, so I decided to stop it.

How can I enable an unprevileged user to invoke this command and adjust the frequency on his demand?\n\nA: TurboBoos can be disabled only in BIOS settings, if you have no such option there you can't disble TurboBoost short of customizing BIOS ROM. \nTo update value in such files from console use \necho -n 100 > /proc/filename. Values are not generally stored anywhere. \nTo allow non-root to do it, create a script that modifies values, and use visudo to allow access to script.\n\nA: I've found there is a tool set named 'TLP' (http://linrunner.de/en/tlp/docs/tlp-linux-advanced-power-management.html) that beside a vast collection of other power saving settings is able to set the maximal CPU frequency for AC and battery use on the users preference. It is no clean solution to the question because it does many more things, but most of them are useful too... \nAfter installation, one can modify the configuration at /etc/default/tlp. There are two entries for that: CPU_SCALING_MAX_FREQ_ON_AC and CPU_SCALING_MAX_FREQ_ON_BAT. The values given there will be used by the TLP scripts to set the CPU frequency limits depending on if a battery is used or not, and it will restore the values after suspend and standby too.

Is there any possibility of extracting the file using any method?\n\nA: First, if the header is corrupted or the header is password protected and you don't know the password, the program has no information about the content of the archive and is therefore unable to extract files.\nExtracting with unrar and the keep broken extracted files option sometimes works, but it depends on the archive contents.\nunrar x -kb example.rar\n\nAdvice for sharing files: Avoid zipping¹, nested zipping², splitting³, remuxing⁴, etcetera.\n\n\n1. Avoid zipping, because it might actually be nested zipping or nested compression. Many modern formats like Office Open XML (DOCX) and OpenDocument (ODF) are already compressed. The bits and energy you think you can save and be considerate about the environment will go to waste when the many machines between you and the recipient try to be smart and protect people by unpacking and checking everything, which some do. It also generates false positives and it may be annoying for the recipient on a device that cannot handle a particular compression algorithm. I know that makes me sound a bit grumpy, zip has been just fine, until you research how the many compression formats evolved, what kind of modern features did not succeed and you remember early modern devices which struggled with GIF, PDF and so much more. Just keep it simple and people happy by not burdening them with a lot of complexity. :-)\n2. Nested zipping or nested compression does not improve compression, it makes it worse. Some encoders and algorithms try to be smart and decide not to compress already compressed content any further. That's the way to technical explanation, the simple explanation is: It's annoying and time consuming.  \n3. Avoid splitting if you don't have to. I've seen many implementations and workarounds over the years which puzzled other people, including me when I was much younger. Keep it simple when you can.\n4. That's more from a video encoding nerd point of view and having to deal with e-mail, malware and fax transmission analysis in a previous job. I could send you awkward video files with actual documents in them when you are in a hurry and you just need that one important document. But I try to be a nice guy, so I don't do that and I expect others to be nice too.\n\n\nA: If the incomplete rar archive is part of a series of multiple archives belonging to the same group it is possible to extract the individual parts, but only starting with the first archive until a missing archive is not found, and then the remainder of the extraction will not be successful.

Though you might also use xargs:\n  find -name '*.wsdl' | xargs emacs {}\n\n\nA: Here's a quick hack that should do what you want with minimal keystrokes, if you don't mind that the last command is executed twice.\nUse backtick, ala:\n`!!`\ne.g.\n\n$ find . -name HardToFind.txt\nsome/crazy/path/to/HardToFind.txt\n$ vim `!!`\n\n*edit: I see the above linked \"possibly duped\" question also contains this answer. still relevant directly to this one, so leaving it, but sorry for the dupe.\n\nA: Run the command in the command substitution:\noutput=$(find -name '*.wsdl')\n\nThe output is now stored in the output variable which you can use as many times as you like, with the following command:\necho \"$output\"\n\n\nA: `!!` is a great solution, but if you want to be even quicker you could use aliases.\nUnfortunately it won't work:\n~$ alias test='echo `!!`'\n~$ test\nzsh: command not found: !!\n\nSo instead use `fc -e -`\n Example aliases I use:\ncopy output:\nalias co='echo `fc -e -` | xclip -in -selection clipboard'\n\nopen with vim; if output has many lines, opens all of them in tabs:\nalias vo='vim -p `fc -e -`'\n\n", "Q: Squid proxy with ncsa_auth I'm trying to setup a squid proxy with ncsa_auth but I cant find ncsa_auth on my system\nI installed squid with apt-get install squid\nAs i understand it it should be installed with squid, anyone know of another way to install it or why it wasn't installed in the first place?\n$ dpkg -L squid\n/.\n/usr\n/usr/share\n/usr/share/doc\n/usr/share/doc/squid\n/usr/share/doc/squid/copyright\n/usr/share/doc/squid/README\n/usr/share/doc/squid/changelog.Debian.gz\n\n\nA: squid is a \"dummy transitional package from squid to squid3\".

In my situation the name of the file is \"basic_ncsa_auth\", and this simpe difference makes a mess hehe.\nI hope it can help you.\n\nA: You are looking in the wrong package with dpkg -L there. The squid package is a transitional package, which only depends on squid3 which does contain the ncsa_auth program.\n", "Q: Is it possible to change just the header of a file? There is a command called file that can recognize multiple file types both by the headers and by the contents of the files (when they are plain text).\nI would like to know if there is a way to alter a file just to its header. To make an mp3 file look like a RAR archive, for example, but letting the rest of the file intact.\nSo, when you want, you can change the header of the file back to MP3 and it will work as before.\nIs this even possible with software available in Ubuntu or in general?\n\nA: Yes, it is possible to alter a binary file with any hex editor. All you need to do is find the magic number and change it. An MP3 file will start with hex 49 44 33 (=ID3) or hex FF FB. \nThe magic number for a RAR file is hex 52 61 72 21 1A 07 00.

The laptop has an NVIDIA GeForce GT750M graphics card. Supposedly the laptop doesn't have integrated graphics but after installing Ubuntu 13.04 and installing the NVIDIA drivers I've discovered that my system is using the integrated graphics instead of the NVIDIA card and no matter what I do I can't seem to get the NVIDIA card activated. I've Googled the heck out of the issue with no success. Anyone have any ideas?\n\n\n\nA: First of all 13.04 is EOL (end of life)\nso install another version like 14.04.3 example\nthen choose to activate an nvidia driver from additional drivers section\nlike nvidia-340 example + install nvidia-prime + enable performance mode\nin nvidia-settings to enable your nvidia card\n", "Q: Installing 13.04 from USB causes a reboot hafway through I recently installed 13.04 Raring Ringtail on a new, formatted USB flash drive, using the installer from http://pendrivelinux.com. To boot from it, I rearranged the boot order in BIOS. The system messes around a bit, then shows \"Try Ubuntu\" and\"Install Ubuntu\" (or words to that effect). Running Ubuntu from the USB - that is, clicking \"Try Ubuntu\" - works fine. The problem arises when I try to install. \nTo simplify things, here's a link:\nHow to Install Ubuntu 13.04 Raring Ringtail\nThese instructions are very clear, except on what to do when that doesn't happen. \nEverything is fine until part 3. I want to install Ubuntu alongside Windows 7, so I leave that box checked, and click \"Continue\". This always causes the computer to restart. I also discovered that if, instead of leaving the first box checked, I click on it (and it stays ticked), the \"Continue\" option turns into \"Restart to Continue\". \nWhen the computer has restarted, everything s exactly as it was before. Nothing is installed, Windows runs fine, and going back to the Ubuntu installer shows that nothing has changed there, either: it still restarts the computer. \nI have searched around on Google; the only links that look promising are on the ubuntuforum.org, which is currently offline, apparently due to a security breach. \nI think this is all of the relevant (and irrelevant!) soft and hardware info:\nOS Name Microsoft Windows 7 Home Premium\nVersion 6.1.7601 Service Pack 1 Build 7601\nOther OS Description    Not Available\nOS Manufacturer Microsoft Corporation\nSystem Name HENRIKOLDCORN\nSystem Manufacturer Hewlett-Packard\nSystem Model    HP Pavilion dv6 Notebook PC\nSystem Type x64-based PC\nProcessor   Intel(R) Core(TM) i5-2450M CPU @ 2.50GHz, 2501 Mhz, 2 Core(s), 4 Logical Processor(s)\nBIOS Version/Date   Hewlett-Packard F.1A, 22/06/2012\nSMBIOS Version  2.7\nWindows Directory   C:\\Windows\nSystem Directory    C:\\Windows\\system32\nBoot Device \\Device\\HarddiskVolume1\nLocale  United Kingdom\nHardware Abstraction Layer  Version = \"6.1.7601.17514\"\nUser Name   HENRIKOLDCORN\\Henrik\nTime Zone   GMT Daylight Time\nInstalled Physical Memory (RAM) 8.00 GB\nTotal Physical Memory   7.95 GB\nAvailable Physical Memory   4.09 GB\nTotal Virtual Memory    15.9 GB\nAvailable Virtual Memory    11.2 GB\nPage File Space 7.95 GB\nPage File   C:\\pagefile.sys\n\nThe USB flash drive is a new SanDisk 16 GB Cruzer Edge, that used to contain some rubbish from SanDisk about encryption software, that was deleted when I formatted the drive with Windows. \nSo, what am I doing wrong, and how can I fix it?\n\nA: Since it is a HP and Windows 7 is usually installed in BIOS mode even if motherboard also is UEFI, you have used all 4 primary partitions. \nMost users with HP backup the HP-Tools partition as it is small and also can be redownloaded from HP. That gives you an available primary partition to use as an extended partition which can hold many logical partitions to use for Linux. \nAlso make sure you have not hibernated Windows.\nBest to use Windows to shrink the Windows main install as the HP-Tools will not give enough space for installing Ubuntu. And reboot Windows so it can run its chkdsk and make its repairs due to its new size. Then you can install into the free space automatically or use manual partitioning to create your own partitions.\nOther issues that probably do not apply.\nIssues that only sometimes cause problems are RAID often from Intel SRT or Ultrabook type systems. Users who have tried to use Windows to create new partitions and drive is converted to dynamic partitions which do not work with Linux. Or a drive that was gpt and Windows converts back to MBR(msdos) but leaves gpt backup data on drive creating confusion on which partition type drive really is. \n\nA: I have had similar problems with 13.04 as well. Found it easier to install 12.04 which is rock stable then do a distribution upgrade from there. \n", "Q: Can the positions for Unity Window Snapping be modified to include more options? There is a pre-existing question similar to mine that you can find here: Can Snap-Windows be set up for 4 windows instead of just 2?\nThe questioner didn't ask the question with enough detail. In the current version of Windows Snap you can only select left or right half, top or bottom half, one of the corners, or maximize. I have a 1080p display on my laptop and would like to be able to add more options to snapping. I use some apps that take up much of the screen and other apps that require much less room. \nI'd like to add the option to snap 3/4 to the left and 1/4 to the right. Is this possible? \n\nA: Yes this is possible. If you use CCSM, you can configure the \"grid\" plugin to include all the corners of the screen and even the bottom edge of the screen.\n\nClick below to install:\n\nThen:\n\n*\n\n*Run \"ccsm\" from the Dash.\n\n*Select the Grid Plugin.\n\n*Select Edges.\n\n*Customize to your heart's content.\n\n*Do not skin a puppy or perform the rain dance.\n\n*Profit.\n\nUpon re-reading your question:\nThe level of precision you seek is not available.

I plugged the USB keyboard to another computer it works fine.  Somehow, after 12.04 upgrade, Ubuntu stops recognizing USB keyboard on a laptop AMILO Fujitsu Siemens.  \nAny advise please?

It was nasty for me because I had no PS/2.  \nI used a different system to downloaded Ubuntu 12.10 and made an install key.  Then I booted my broken system off that 12.10 key.

How could I replace CentOS with Ubuntu?\nI need to create 2 users. The IP addresses are 198.56.238.192 and 198.56.248.171. How will could I set up them with Putty?\n\nA: You're asking multiple questions, each of which should be their own separate questions, but I'll answer them both here, anyways.\n(1) (BACKUP ANY DATA YOU WANT TO KEEP BEFORE DOING THIS!) To change the Operating System, the VPS provider should be able to do that.  If there's not an automated \"Reinstall Operating System\" option in the VPS control panel pages for your provider, file a support ticket with your VPS provider.  If they tell you that you cannot switch operating systems, or that they do not have Ubuntu VPSes, then you won't be able to switch to Ubuntu (but most VPS providers have Ubuntu images)\n(2) Once the VPS is set up with whatever OS, you should SSH in by specifying the IP address for your server, then it'll connect and prompt you for the username and password.  Provide those, and once you're logged in, do sudo useradd --create-home --user-group --shell /bin/bash USERNAME where USERNAME is the login name for the user you're creating, because the default user you login to will either be root or a user with sudo access\n\nA: Your not going to be able to install Ubuntu without having KVM like access to the server and some help from the ISP.  Usually you can select what OS you would want on your VPN at the time of order and in most cases change it at any time ( Losing any data on your server )\nIn answer to your second question open putty and make sure SSH is selected. In the text box that says Host Name or IP address put your ip eg. 198.56.238.192 hit open it will then connect your server and prompt you for a username and password to login ( I hope you have these)\nthen use the useradd command to add the users you need.\n", "Q: Unity - black windows when gaining focus I'm using Ubuntu13.04+Unity and, from time to time when I switch between windows, the one that gains focus goes bananas, and it's rendered completely black.

I am running the 64-bit version of Ubuntu, but when I install the graphics driver it installs, but then says there was a problem.\nWhen I go to open my Catalyst control center it says that the graphics driver was not installed properly. I did download the 64-bit driver because that is what my computer is a 64 bit machine.\nThe problem also persists as in I cannot get my compiz to work and also it doesn't show any of the effects I had before I used compiz such as the simple opening and closing effects.\nI had to reinstall Ubuntu on my computer after uninstalling the graphics card. I have looked and cannot seem to find anything...I know AMD pulled the plug on the 4,000 series Radeon HD in the Ubuntu 13.04 and up. How can I resolve this issue and get my GPU to work?\n\nA: You should use the Legacy Catalyst driver, AMD no longer support the HD2xxx/3xxx/4xxx series cards with newer drivers.

I've tried install Windows 7 Ultimate and it's not working properly due to the video card driver issue. The Celeron processor is so old that even  a custom driver for it doesn't do the job. Can't see even  a simple Youtube video. Will Ubuntu work on my system, and fix the problem with the video card? Or I should try it first and let you know.\nThanks in advance.\n\nA: You can install either Xubuntu or Lubuntu on your Dell Inspiron 1300. Preferably Xubuntu because Lubuntu doesn't have a Long Term Support release. Preferably Xubuntu 12.04 because it is a Long Term Support release which is supported by updates until April, 2015.\n\nA: According to the specs from Dell, your best bet would be Lubuntu or Xubuntu.  Whichever one you choose, I recommend that once you create a bootable CD/DVD or USB flash, is to try befor you install, that way you'll get an idea if it will work OK with your hardware, and once everything is OK, you can go ahead and install.\n\nA: Linux Drivers are different than MS Windows so try downloading a disc image to a DVD/ USB Thumbdrive.

I keep trying to install the OS, but it tells me there's no root system on the 120gb SSD that I want to use. I was wondering if anyone could help because I cannot find what I think is a relevant article.\n\nA: With 2 drives it is important to partition second drive as gpt partitioned not the usual default MBR(msdos). I might also make an efi partition on that drive even though system will only boot thru one efi partition. Then you could boot Ubuntu SSD without Windows drive, if you also install grub2's boot loader to both efi partitions.\nThen you should be able to install in UEFI mode following the UEFI type installs.\nI have only BIOS but use gpt and use gparted to partition drives.\nI used gparted and selected gpt under device, advanced & select gpt over msdos(MBR) default partitioning....\n", "Q: /var directory and redis In terms of the filesystem hierarchy standard, the /var directory contains variable files — files whose content is expected to continually change during normal operation of the system— such as logs, spool files, and temporary e-mail files.\nNow if you read the redis documentation:\nhttp://redis.io/topics/quickstart\nThere is this line:\nCreate a directory where to store your Redis config files and your data:\nsudo mkdir /etc/redis\nsudo mkdir /var/redis\n\nNow the config files obviously go in /etc. But it says \"store your data in /var\".

What I'd love is to button that says \"fill up the cache\" that downloads everything that fits (which in my case would be everything).  Anyone know to achieve something like this?\n\nA: Long press an artist and select Save all. You can also do that on a per-album basis.

If you are interested in tasks like torrent clients that likely won't be feasible since they don't fall into that pattern of on-briefly-and-suspend-when-done.\nThis answer will be useful to figure out timed suspend and wake.\n\nA: The short answer is No. When the device is suspended, all of the components are shut down except the RAM. Transmission needs things like your CPU and network card, which in turn need different things running. The best thing to do to keep processes running while the computer is not in use is to just Lock it.\nSource: man pm-action\n\nA: No, cause something like BitTorrent will use CPU, HDD and WiFi\nThat means nothing can suspend.\nit's like downloading a file on your mobile phone, even if you turned off the screen the battery will drain and the phone gets hot cause he didnt even suspend\n\nA: 13.04 is old, and no longer supported.

It's an unsupported release, whose benefits are not clearly communicated on the website (\"This image is adjusted to work properly on Mac systems.\"). The filename suggests to be a special version for Mac, but the image doesn't has a EFI-compatible bootloader (more info), so the only way to boot this image on a Mac is from CD in BIOS-compatibility mode, not EFI mode. Therefore, booting this image from USB stick is not possible.\nTry ubuntu-12.04.2-desktop-amd64.iso from http://releases.ubuntu.com instead.

I would like to install ubuntu so that my computer recognises both my ssd and regular drive the same, is there any way to do this when installing ubuntu. Any help is appreciated. \nThank you\n\nA: What do you mean by \"merge the two drives together\"? Do you want to have one \"virtual\" partition on two physical discs? Then probably you should google LVM (I've never used it, so it's all I can say).\nBut why do you want to merge the two discs? If I were you, I would use the fast SSD for some selected data (for fast boot or whatever) and HDD for the rest. When they are merged together you can't control where your data is stored and you don't benefit from having fast SSD (unless you are very lucky).\nIf the reason for merging is that you don't like too many logical partitions in your computer then you don't have to worry: in linux you don't normally navigate with drives but with a virtual directory structure (see the next paragraph). So some smart mounting may be a solution: you can mount your SSD in some folder (e.g. inside another folder stored physically on HDD!) (or even divide it into partitions and mount in several folders).\nFinally: if - as you said - you're installing ubuntu on SSD, then you can just use the standard schema: put your ubuntu (\"/\" directory called root) on SDD (24 GB should suffice since my old installation is 16 GB) and your home folder (\"/home\") on HDD. All your personal data will be stored in one place (home) and you will benefit from having system files on a fast SSD  (dunno if it is the best way of utilising SSD, but for sure it is the simplest).\n", "Q: Catalyst on Ubuntu 13.04 hybrid graphics supporting dual screen? anyone made double screen configuration works on Ubuntu 13.04 using Catalyst?

I wrote a bash script (here) for extracting EXIF GPS coordinates from an image and displaying those coordinates as a pointer in Google Maps. It works perfectly when used like this in the terminal:\nGUI=1 ./show_location_in_chrome.sh /path/to/image.jpg\n\nI have added a right-click command to Nautilus using Nautilus-Actions with these settings:\n\n           Path: GUI=1 /home/tomas/show_location_in_chrome.sh\n     Parameters: %f\nBasename filter: *.jpg\n\nBut when I right-click a JPEG file and click the menu item, nothing happens. The only exception is when the \"Execution mode\" is set to \"Display output\", in which case the script works as intended. Unfortunately Nautilus also displays a large window with script output that I have to manually close every time.\nHow do I figure out why the script doesn't work in any other execution mode than \"Display output\"? Please comment if I can provide any more specific information.\nThe \"Run command\" displayed in the command output is:\n/bin/sh -c 'GUI=1 /home/tomas/show_location_in_chrome.sh '\\''/home/tomas/Dropbox/Camera Up\nloads/2013-07-21 14.58.33.jpg'\\'''\n\nEdit: I have added #!/usr/bin/env bash to the top of my script and removed the explicit call to bash in the \"Path\" setting. It changed nothing.\n\nEdit: I added echo \"Works\" > ~/test.txt to the top of the script (below the shebang), then clicked the menu item. No files were added to my Home folder, so I have concluded that the script isn't even being executed when the execution mode is anything other than \"Display output\".\n\nA: Possibly, with \"display output\" off, it probably doesn't run the command in a shell, so the GUI=1 syntax isn't parsed as an assignment. If that's the case, changing the command to this should work:\n/usr/bin/env GUI=1 /home/tomas/show_location_in_chrome.sh\n\nAs an aside, you probably don't need that GUI variable, you can use what is already there to determine whether to use zenity or not. E.g. The DISPLAY variable should only be set if you're logged in graphically, so changing [ \"$GUI\" ] to [ \"$DISPLAY\" ] (or better, [[ $DISPLAY ]]) should work fine.\nIf you only want to use zenity when not running it from a terminal, you can test for a terminal with the -t test. E.g.\nif [[ ! -t 1 && $DISPLAY ]]; then   # if fd 1 (stdout) is not connected to a terminal, and DISPLAY is non-empty\n    zenity ...\nelse\n    echo ...\nfi\n\nEDIT: Alternatively, add an option to specify \"gui or not\".\ngui=0\nwhile [[ $1 = -* ]]; do\n    case $1 in\n        -h|--help) echo \"usage...\"; exit ;;\n        -g|--gui) gui=1 ;;\n         *) echo >&2 \"invalid option: $1\"; exit 1 ;;\n    esac\n    shift\ndone\n\n#...\n\nif (( gui )); then\n    zenity ...\nelse\n    echo ...\nfi\n\n", "Q: Clarifying the claim of \"full Ubuntu desktop OS\" support on the Ubuntu Edge Can anyone clarify what Canonical means when creating a \"full Ubuntu desktop OS\" on the proposed Ubuntu edge?\nMy definition of a \"full Ubuntu desktop OS\" is if a software package can be complied for Ubuntu 13.04 the Ubuntu 13.04 OS on the Ubuntu Edge will attempt to run said software if in desktop mode. \nI say attempt as any desktop can fail to run correctly compiled software but they will all attempt to run the software.\nDoes my definition of a \"full Ubuntu desktop OS\" match Canonical's definition?\n\nA: My understanding is that the Edge is designed to work with Ubuntu Touch and Android as a handset, and when connected to a monitor using HDMI then you see the Ubuntu desktop experience, that is, the phone OS becomes the full Ubuntu Desktop OS on the monitor.\nI can't speak for Canonical, that however is my understanding.\n", "Q: The process of updating a \"Normal Release\"? I was amazed to see 13.04 \"just work\" when it came to getting my wireless internet up and running.

The short term support concerns me a little.\nAm I going to need to keep a spindle of CD/DVD's with me at all times to always be updating (every 6 months or so)?\nIs it possible to update cleanly without having to completely wipe out my existing install?\nIs there any way to go from 13.04 to 13.10 (or any future releases) purely through updates, as opposed to completely replacing the operating system?\nThanks guys!\n\nA: I wouldn't recommend any rolling release of Linux to a new user. It's easy to break your system with a rolling release, and then you may have to reinstall the operating system anyway. Compare this with installing a Long Term Support release which only takes about a half an hour, and is supported by updates for a 5-year term of support. The latest Long Term Support release of Ubuntu is Ubuntu 12.04 which is supported by updates until April, 2017.\nRegarding your other questions: no, Ubuntu does not have rolling releases. It is possible to do an operating system upgrade to the next available release in the 6-month release cycle, and in addition to that it is possible to upgrade a Long Term Support release of Ubuntu to the next available Long Term Support release.\n", "Q: Installing and Running Firefox Using Kubuntu I keep trying to download and install Firefox.

Is there a way to replace missing icons with icons in another pack we prefer instead of Hi-Color that Ubuntu uses by default?\n\nA: Try adding the icon to ~/.icons using the same name used in /usr/share/icons/hicolor/.... The point is that applications look first on ~/.icons for the icons they need.\nFor example, the icon for Nautilus is /usr/share/icons/hicolor/scalable/nautilus.svg. If you want to override it, add the icon you want to /home/username/.icons with the name nautilus.svg (must be a .svg image in this case).\nIf ~/.icons does not exists you need to create it\ncd && mkdir .icons\n\nNotice that, in general, you should use the same folder structure used in /usr/share/icons/hicolor. That is the way you add a new icon theme for example.\n", "Q: (13.04) No laptop speaker output on HP ENVY dv7 Quad Core edition Recently, I decided to use Ubuntu as a work related OS.

So my question is: is there any method to filter out .txt files on descending order of created date? I'm currently using Ubuntu 12.04 on 32 bits.\n\nA: Expanding on the comment from @soulsource you need to use the find command the most basic usage you could use is finding all files which end in .txt on your machine, the following command will descend though the file system starting at the root directory:\nfind / -type f -iname '*.txt' \n\nNow if you know you saved the file in a specific directory, your home directory for instance, but forget which sub directory you can always speed up the find by changing the path:\nfind ~/ -type f -iname '*.txt'\n\nNow, you just need to pipe, |, the resulting files to ls to order them by date\nfind ~/ -type f -iname '*.txt' | xargs ls -td1\n\nIf you're getting a large number of files back, you can always limit the number of responses by piping it again to head. As an example, if you're only interested in the 10 most recent results you can use:\nfind ~/ -type f -iname '*.txt' | xargs ls -td1 | head -n10\n\nOne thing to note about find is that by default it does not follow symbolic links, if like me you have a few symbolic links in your home directory and want to check those too you need to use the -follow option to find. \nfind ~/ -type f -iname '*.txt' -follow | xargs ls -td1 | head -n10\n\n\nA: The find command can filter by mtime, e.g.\nfind path/to/some/directory -type f -name *.txt -mtime 5\n\nThat will display any files in path/to/some/directory that were modified in the last 5*24 hours. They will not be sorted by creation date, however -- assuming you haven't modified too many text files recently -- with a tight enough mtime filter, the list of files returned should be pretty small. Rather than sorting by date, this command will only show files that have been recently modified...\nYou could probably combine that with a pipe into xargs ls as AJefferiss describes to add the sort, if necessary.\n\nA: You can find *.txt files and sort them by modified date using the following command in terminal in terminal:\nfind /path/to/search -type f -iname '*.txt' -printf \"%-.22T+ %Tx %.8TX %p\\n\" | sort | awk '{print $2 \"\\t\" $3 \"\\t\" $4}'\n\nor:\ncd /path/to/search\nfind . -type f -iname '*.txt' -printf \"%-.22T+ %Tx %.8TX %p\\n\" | sort | awk '{print $2 \"\\t\" $3 \"\\t\" $4}'\n\nFor last 10 modified *.txt files use:\nfind . -type f -iname '*.txt' -printf \"%-.22T+ %Tx %.8TX %p\\n\" | sort | awk '{print $2 \"\\t\" $3 \"\\t\" $4}' | tail\n\n", "Q: Getting command-not-found working under zsh I'm trying to get the command-not-found feature under Ubuntu to work under zsh, without luck:\n➜  ~  pdfunite\nzsh: command not found: pdfunite\n➜  ~  bash\nu@ub:~$ pdfunite\nThe program 'pdfunite' is currently not installed.

So recently, the RC's of Linux Kernel 3.11 were released. As you may know, this new kernel comes with dynamic power management for users of the open source Radeon driver. Since I have power management issues with the default kernel of Ubuntu 13.04, I wanted to try this out.\nDoe someone know how to enable this new feature after I downloaded and installed the latest kernel RC from the Kernel Testing PPA?\nEDIT: More specifically, I am talking about this: http://www.phoronix.com/scan.php?page=news_item&px=MTM5NjE\n\nA: Ok, I'm going to part from the presumption you already have the kernel 3.11-GIT and have a r6xx-SI or newer ATI card. From there on, you just have to add radeom.dpm=1  as a kernel module parameter and DPM should be activated.\nIt could be either in the GRUB parameter, in the /etc/default/grub file write\nGRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT=\"quiet radeon.dpm=1\"\nsudo update-grub\n\nOr in a .conf file under your /etc/modprobe directory:\nsudo su -\ntouch /etc/modprobe.d/radeon-dpm.conf\necho options radeon dpm=1 > /etc/modprobe.d/radeon-dpm.conf \ncat /etc/modprobe.d/radeon-dpm.conf \n# will output \"options radeon dpm=1\"\n\nQuote from the sources:\n\nThe AMD Radeon driver finally has dynamic power management support! For Radeon GPUs the core clock and memory clocks will dynamically adjust (along with the voltages) based upon load, this works for multi-monitor configurations, and it's at near feature parity to what's provided by PowerPlay and the features in the AMD Catalyst driver. This is a big win for saving on power/battery when using the open-source Radeon Linux driver along with offering better performance for newer GPUs that have a boot clock speed that's lower than their rated frequencies. This support goes back to Radeon HD 2000 (R600) GPUs but is currently not enabled by default but requires setting radeon.dpm=1.\n\nSources:\n\n\n*\n\n*http://lists.freedesktop.org/archives/dri-devel/2013-June/040436.html\n\n*http://www.phoronix.com/scan.php?page=article&item=amd_radeon_dpm&num=1\n\n*http://www.phoronix.com/scan.php?page=news_item&px=MTQwNjA\n\n*http://www.phoronix.com/scan.php?page=article&item=amd_dpm_preview&num=1\n\nA: Update (8-05-2014): As expected, in Ubuntu 14.04 DPM is enabled by default for all modern AMD GPU's (HD 4000 through HD 7000 series). If you are running this release together with a supported graphics card, you don't need to do anything to use this feature.\nUpdate (28-11-2013): Ubuntu 13.10 ships with the 3.11 kernel by default. So if you are using this release, all you need to do is add the parameter to the Linux Kernel. I updated the guide accordingly. Also, it looks like by Ubuntu 14.04, DPM will be enabled by default so hopefully this guide will be obsolete by then! ;)\nOk, In the last few days I experimented a bit and got it enabled! It's actually really easy once you found out how to do it.. For people who also want to try it, I'll explain every step. Starting with the installation of the new kernel.\nFirst of all a few points to consider. The Radeon DPM support is only for Radeon HD 2000 (R600) series graphics cards and newer. If you're using a really old ATI Radeon graphics card, the power management support is already tapped out on the open-source driver.\nSteps for Ubuntu 13.04 or below only:\nTo use Radeon DPM you need the Linux 3.11 kernel or newer. You can use the Ubuntu mainline kernel PPA and download the latest stable 3.11 Linux kernel image from this kernel.ubuntu.com directory. Any future kernel updates are fine too and can then also be found in this directory.\nUsing the dynamic power management feature requires updated firmware for the graphics card. The latest Radeon microcode/firmware can be downloaded from this directory. You need the *_smc.bin files from June. If you're unsure of your specific graphics card codename, you can generally find it from looking at output of lspci -v | less ...  The file(s) need to be placed within /lib/firmware/radeon. If you try to use Radeon DPM without the firmware, acceleration will end up being disabled for the GPU. You also need to make sure you have the updated firmware in /lib/firmware/radeon before installing the >3.11 kernel - it will be pulled automagically into the installed image.\nUbuntu 13.10 or lower, or users of Radeon HD 3000 or below:\nThe Radeon DPM support is not enabled by default below Linux kernel 3.13, or for older GPUs. You must add the radeon.dpm=1 parameter to the Linux kernel to enable it in these cases. For the steps to do so on Ubuntu, see the Ubuntu Wiki about the different ways. \nWith the new kernel installed, firmware updated and Kernel parameter enabled you should be good to go. You must now reboot your system and you can check if everything is working after that by doing \ncat /sys/kernel/debug/dri/64/radeon_pm_info\nNote: @luca992 pointed out that the file radeon_pm_info could be in a different directory (for example in /sys/kernel/debug/dri/1/ instead of dri/64/). If you're absolutely sure you followed all steps correctly, you can check if this could be the case in your situation.\nYou should see something like this:\nuvd    vclk: 0 dclk: 0\npower level 0    sclk: 22000 mclk: 25000 vddc: 900\n\nYou can further configure DPM by opening /etc/rc.local and adding the following line:\necho parameter > /sys/class/drm/card0/device/power_dpm_state\n\nWhere \"parameter\" can be:\n\n\n*\n\n*battery (a set of performance levels targeted for optimal operation on battery)\n\n*balanced (a set of performance levels targeted for optimal every day use)\n\n*performance (a set of performance levels targeted for the highest GPU performance)\n\n\nSources: http://www.botchco.com/agd5f/?p=57\n\nA: In case tlp meets your intentions :\n\nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:linrunner/tlp\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get install tlp tlp-rdw\n\nFor thinkpads it is :\n\nsudo apt-get install tp-smapi-dkms acpi-call-tools\n\nWhen am not wrong - tlp is not inmediately dependent on the kernel-version - it depends more on the hardware.
