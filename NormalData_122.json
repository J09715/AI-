["Q: Cloud instances in OpenStack can't import public SSH key does anybody know how to actually fix the problem of Ubuntu Cloud VM instances in OpenStack not being able to import public keys from Nova-api's meta-data server with the following message:\n2012-07-18 11:05:45,409 - util.py[WARNING]: 'http://169.254.169.254/2009-04-04/meta-data/instance-id' failed [113/120s]: url error [[Errno 111] Connection refused]\n2012-07-18 11:05:52,419 - DataSourceEc2.py[CRITICAL]: giving up on md after 120 seconds\n\nI've found numerous mentions of the problem (e.g. here or here) and tried turning this iptables rule on/off (using iptables-save and iptables-apply), but it doesn't work.

The syntax is (not explained anywhere else but in the source code):\n#cloud-config\nssh_import_id: [your-launchpad-username]\n\n", "Q: How can foreground and background colors be changed for Software Center?

For some reason, Your system might be running dash instead of bash. Perhaps, you need to change your login shell to /bin/bash (should have been the default). Type the below command in terminal:\nchsh -s /bin/bash\n\nThen, log out and log in.\nIf you did not install bash in your system, you can install it by the command:\nsudo apt-get install bash\n\nAlthough, you can use other shell like zsh or tcsh (including history).\n\nA: What you are referring to is bash own history, which is typically saved in ~/.bash_history file, and this functionality is embedded into bash itself. No need to install additional packages.\nPlease have a look at this answer on how to check and enable bash history.\nAlso, there is a chance that you are not using bash, but some other shell.

Because I wanted to get more free space on my HDD, I deleted old kernels (dont ask me why I was so mad.).

You can do what Ramchandra suggested, but if you want to preserve your apps you should avoid reinstalling (as that would, as you've seen, remove the apps.) If you want to avoid uninstalling the boot with a missing kernel:\n\n\n*\n\n*Boot to LiveCD.\n\n*Using nautilus, open up the broken partition.\n\n*Navigate to /home/myusernamehere. All your files will be there.\nSome other files you might want to save:\n\n\n*\n\n*/etc/apt/sources.list, if you have any manual repos.\n\n\nAfter you are done with this, stick it onto a flash drive or email it to yourself.\nApps is a trickier part. I have come up with a somewhat roundabout solution that will take some time (most of it without you actively participating), but this should recover your apps (without settings/configurations)\n\n\n*\n\n*Stick around LiveCD.\n\n*Navigate to /usr/lib. (It may take a while to load.)\n\n*Woah! Huge amount of folders. Open up gedit in liveCD.\n\n*Type this in gedit:\n#!/bin/sh\nsudo apt-get install folder1 folder2 folder3\n...Where folder1 folder2 folder3 are the names of the folders.\nThese are all the programs you have installed on ubuntu (I think). Some of these (about 50%, maybe more) come with the system, so the arent  necessary, but a safe bet is just put everything.\nAnother place to look for apps is /etc and /etc/alternatives. (Update me if I am missing any spots, internet!)\nSave the file as .sh and email or flash drive it.\nNow, when you first start up your computer (after total reinstall) you can run this script to sudo apt-get all your programs that you previously had. They'll be good as new!\n\nA: Did you try the recovery option?\nYou can install Ubuntu over an exisiting Ubuntu installation - all your files will remain.\nThough if you modify system files, those changes will be wiped out.\nTo do so, at the installer select advanced partition and use your ubuntu installed partition as / .\nI have not tested it though.\n\nA: I only thought that I had deleted the kernel. Instead, I had somehow taken it out of the first in the queue of the kernels so that the system tried to boot with another kernel that was not the needed one. The needed kernel was not deleted. I solved this by choosing the right kernel from the advanced start menu.

I have a Microsoft XBOX 360 gamepad with the wireless adapter and I was wondering what I would have to install to use them with Ubuntu I do know that when using this on Windows I have to manually install the drivers for the wireless receiver (if that is relevant.)\n\nA: This is an update to existing answers for a way to get an XBox360 controller working in Wine >= 1.7, including Steam games in Wine on Ubuntu >= 13.10. No root permissions needed for installation and operation.\nThe below method makes use of x360ce.exe, which basically provides Dinput codes for Wine to communicate with a game (Note that your XBox controller still sends Xinput controls).\n\n\n*\n\n*Plug in your XBox360 (or compatible) controller to have it automatically recognized with the xpad kernel module.  \n\nNo need to install and run xboxdrv because at present the controller appears to be recognized. Do not blacklist the Xpad kernel module as was recommended in older tutorials.\n\n\n*Download the ZIP archives for the Windows (Wine) application x360ce and its accompanying .dll binaries for Xinput, and Dinput.\n\n*Extract the ZIP archives to copy their content with at least the following files to the game's executable directory (e.g. ~/.wine/drive_c/Programs/Games/game.exe or ~/.wine/drive_c/Programs/Steam/SteamApps/common/Name_Of_Game/game.exe):\n\n\n*\n\n*x360ce.exe\n\n*dinput8.dll\n\n*xinput1_3.dll\nsome games may also need: \n\n\n*\n\n*xinput1_9.dll\n\n\n*Run x360ce.exe with Wine to create a sample x360ce.ini file in the game's directory if not yet present.\n\n*Quit x360ce.exe (you may have to kill Wine to do so as the application may hang)\n\n*Open the x360ce.ini file with an editor to add the following line to prevent future crashes or hangs:\nVersion=1\n\n\n*Start x360ce.exe again to recognize your XBox controller(s).\n\n*We may optionally choose from a premade setup file as soon as the controller was recognized.\n\n*Adjust buttons and joystick axes of your controller to appropriate values.\n\n\n*Save saves these settings to the xbox360ce.ini file\n\n*Then quit (or kill) x360ce.exe\n\n*If needed open the x360ce.ini file in an editor again to fine tune some of the settings.\n\n*Your Windows game should now recognize the controller when started from Wine.\n\n\n\n  \n*\n  \n*Do not unplug the controller, as it will then only be recognized after a restart of the game. \n  \n*Backup the .ini file for future use to avoid re-calibration.\n  \n\n\nA: If you find difficulties running your XBOX 360 controller, then this will help you install it on a computer running Ubuntu, and also show you how to configure it. These instructions are workable for both wired or wireless X-Box 360 controllers.\nGetting Started\nTo be able to use your Xbox 360 wired/wireless controller under Ubuntu 12.04 (Precise Pangolin), you need first to install some required packages. \nOpen the terminal and run this command:\nsudo apt-get install --install-recommends jstest* joystick xboxdrv\n\nYou also need to ensure that xpad is not getting loaded:\necho \"blacklist xpad\" | sudo tee -a /etc/modprobe.d/blacklist.conf\nsudo rmmod xpad  # unload module if already loaded\n\nThen run the xboxdrv:\nxboxdrv --silent \n\nConfiguring the pad\nConnect now your game controller to your PC via USB (wired) or connect your XBOX 360 PC wireless gaming receiver for your wireless controller, then run this command to start the configuration:\njstest-gtk\n\nIn the window that shows up, select your controller (Microsoft X-Box 360 pad, Generic X-Box pad, etc.) and click Properties:\n\nNote If your controller is not listed, try to click the \"Refresh\" button. \nA new window will pop-up which will help you calibrate your gaming controller, remap the buttons of your game controller (changing the order of axis and buttons), etc.\n\nAfter you finish your configuration, save your new settings and close the window. You will be able now to use your Xbox 360 controller to play games under Ubuntu.\nConfigure xboxdrv to start at boot\nIf you're making a dedicated machine or want to ensure that xboxdrv is loaded on startup you can do this:\nFirst create an upstart job: \nsudoedit /etc/init/xboxdrv.conf\n\nand in there add the following contents:\nstart on filesystem\nexec xboxdrv -D\nexpect fork\n\nThis will ensure xboxdrv is started on boot. \nSources:\n\n\n*\n\n*upubuntu.com\n\n*Jonas Wagner\n\nA: I am not sure what you have tried, so let's try official instructions first. Please open a terminal(search for it in the dash) and type the following commands, one by one(no need to copy the output):\nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:grumbel/ppa\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get install xboxdrv\nsudo apt-get install xboxdrv-stable \n\nReboot, and your wireless receiver should be recognized.\nNote that unfortunately, there isn't a 12.04 package for xboxdrv-stable. You may consider contacting contacting the package maintainer, assuming you have a Launchpad.net account. Still, try using the software that needs the driver.\n\nA: Ubuntu 14.04, 15.10, 16.04:\nI created an PPA to install and create a proper daemon for xboxdrv in 14.04 and above. \nAdditionally this PPA will cleanup broken config, mark xpad as conflict (stop it if necessary), start the xboxdrv daemon and create a \"Joysticks\" entry into System Settings.\nTo install it, run in a terminal:\nsudo apt-add-repository -y ppa:rael-gc/ubuntu-xboxdrv\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get install ubuntu-xboxdrv\n\nPS: I cloned the package to other releases and even changed it to work with systemd.\n\nA: Just as an unrelated side note, the error you were seeing with your makefile was due to the fact that makefiles use tabs for indentation and likely when the file was copied those tabs were changed to spaces.\n\nA: Finally solved it. Just type in this in the Terminal\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get install xboxdrv\nxboxdrv --silent &\n\nand then press ctrl+c\nand done you just installed Xbox driver and you're all ready to use your Xbox 360 controller :D. I guess when everyone says the controller is a Plug&Play and it does not then you have to install the necessary  drivers to use it.\n\nA: UPDATE: This is not required for Kernel 4.2 (maybe 15.10 or 16.04) and higher. This Bug has finally been fixed: https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/linux/+bug/1272765.\nIf you have problems with blinking LEDs just add this ppa and install the fixed xpad kernel module from SteamOS. Thanks Valve!\nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:mdeslaur/steamos\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get install steamos-xpad-dkms\n\nThis updates the xpad module in Ubuntu, so you do not need xboxdrv. \n\nA: You don't need to install anything, the kernel has a build in driver. Just plug the wireless adapter into USB and sync the controller. xboxdrv is only needed if you want additional configuration options, button remapping, mouse emulation, etc. \n\nA: That's old stuff. It should work as soon as you plug it in, if the game is compatible. I think if the game expects an xbox controller (i.e not a generic one) in Wine then it's not likely to work. Native games should work.  It's listed as a project for Google Summer of Code so it's on the agenda.\n\nA: I'm running Linux kernel version 4.0.0 and needed to install nothing and configure absolutely nothing to play games with my XBOX 360 controllers. Even linux-native couch co-op games that require more than one controller like \"lovers in a dangerous spacetime\" or \"trine\" worked out of the box. Just plugging in the two controllers and done.\n\nA: The yank-decoupler part of my controller wasn't plugged all the way in. That was all my problem was.\n", "Q: What exactly are items in the /dev directory? I have been writing an application in C++ that transmits radio messages by writing to a modem connected to the serial port. To do this I need to get a file descriptor using code of the form \nfd1=open(“/dev/ttyS0″, O_RDWR | O_NOCTTY | O_NDELAY);\n\nThis made me curious about the nature of the items in /dev. To try to get an idea of the contents of these items I tried a \nsudo cat /dev/ttyS0\n\nonly to get the message\ncat: /dev/ttyS0: Input/output error\n\nwhich didn't help my understanding at all. Are these items actually a file at all or just a kind of link that allows access to the driver functionality?\n\nA: Everything in Linux is a file or a directory. Things in /dev are special files.\nThe majority of devices are either block or character devices; however other types of devices exist and can be created. In general, 'block devices' are devices that store or hold data, 'character devices' can be thought of as devices that transmit or transfer data. For example, diskette drives, hard drives and CD-ROM drives are all block devices while serial ports, mice and parallel printer ports are all character devices. There is a naming scheme of sorts but in the vast majority of cases these are completely illogical.\nDevices are defined by type, such as 'block' or 'character', and 'major' and 'minor' number. The major number is used to categorize a device and the minor number is used to identify a specific device type. For example, all IDE device connected to the primary controller have a major number of 3. Master and slave devices, as well as individual partitions are further defined by the use of minor numbers.\nTaken from Linux-Filesystem-Hierarchy\n\n2 options:\n\n\n*\n\n*Try\n cat < /dev/ttyS0\n\nand see if that works.\n\n*You might solve this error by adding your user to the same group (ie. dialout).\n\nA: From The Linux Documentation Project:\n\nThe computer considers each serial port to be a \"device\". It's\n  sometimes called a terminal device since at one time terminals were\n  the most common use for a serial port. For each such serial port there\n  is a special file in the /dev (device) directory. /dev/ttyS0) is the\n  special file for the serial port known as COM1 in the DOS/Windows\n  world.\nTo send text to a terminal you may redirect standard output of some\n  command-line command to the appropriate special file. For example\n  typing \"echo test > /dev/ttyS1\" at the command prompt should send the\n  word \"test\" to the terminal on ttyS1 (COM2) provided you have write\n  permission on /dev/ttyS1. Similarly, typing \"cat my_file > /dev/ttyS0\"\n  will send the contents of the file my_file to COM1 (ttyS0).\n\n", "Q: How do I start certain services only when needed? I have a laptop. I use it for web+email a lot, and then some days for web development. Using it for the latter, I need apache2 and mysql server running, but normally I do not.\nI'd like a normal boot to NOT start apache and mysql, to conserve power, reduce boot times etc. but then to be able to start these services when needed.\nIn the olden days I might have used runlevels for this, but that's a bit old skool now, as I understand. What's the best way to achieve this in Precise?\n\nA: To stop mysql from starting at boot:\nsudo echo \"manual\" | sudo tee /etc/init/mysql.override\n\nTo stop apache2 from starting at boot:\nsudo update-rc.d apache2 disable 2\n\nWhenever you need to start mysql or apache2 all you need to do is to start the service yourself (and you can also stop both manually).\nYou can use\nsudo apache2ctl {start|stop|restart}\n\nfor that and\nsudo service mysql {start|stop}\n\nfor mysql.\n\nA: A way to do it with good ol' runlevels:\nMySQL now uses an upstart script, but inside that it's still talking about runlevels. Edit /etc/init/mysql.conf and change lines as in this diff:\n-start on runlevel [2345]\n-stop on starting rc RUNLEVEL=[016]\n+start on runlevel [345]\n+stop on starting rc RUNLEVEL=[0126]\n\nApache2 still uses runlevel rc.N.d sym links:\nsudo update-rc.d -f apache2 remove \nsudo update-rc.d apache2  start 91 3 4 5 . stop 09 0 1 6 .\n\nThen on a normal boot (runlevel 2), they won't be started, and when you do sudo telinit 3, they will.\n\nA: you can use programs given in the link look here and here\n", "Q: How to automatically lock my computer after logged in via auto login i have setup my ubuntu 12.04 LTS (unity) to auto login after the computer is turned on after a power outage. so that the web server installed keeps running. but also i have to lock the computer right after logging in so that no one can use it other than me. How would i do that.\ngnome-screensaver-command -l does lock the computer. but manaully. i want it automated after login.\nI dont want anyone to be using the computer other than me.\n\nA: When you install a web server, you don't need to \"login\" to run that web server.\nWeb servers such as apache or nginx start up at boot time with their parent process run by root (to bind to ports).  Subsequent child processes are generally started with the user or group specified in the configs.  Therefore, your computer can be on but not logged in, and your system will still run the web server.  Remote administration can be done by SSH whether you're logged in via the GUI or not.\nTherefore, there is no need for autologin to make the webserver work (unless its a weird Node.js or some other backend that needs to be manually started by a user).\n", "Q: Problem removing 3G mobile broadband dongle on 12.04 I recently upgraded my 3G mobile broadband dongle to a newer model. Ubuntu recognizes it and I can connect/disconnect with no trouble. The problem comes when I try to safely remove the drive by right clicking its icon and choosing \"Safely remove drive\". When I do this I get a popup that displays the following\nUnable to stop drive\n\nError detaching: helper exited with exit code 1: Detaching device /dev/sdc\nUSB device: /sys/devices/pci0000:00/0000:00:04.1/usb2/2-4)\nSYNCHRONIZE CACHE: FAILED: No such file or directory\n(Continuing despite SYNCHRONIZE CACHE failure.)\nSTOP UNIT: FAILED: No such file or directory\n\nI don't really know what to do from here so I generally shutdown then remove the dongle as I do not want to damage it. Is this a common problem? Am I safe to just pull the dongle out after this message. The message is not particularly informative so I am not sure how best to proceed. I never had this problem with the previous model. Any advice would be very much appreciated. The model is identified as HUAWEI TD CARD storage\n\nA: It tries to synchronize its cache after the device has already been removed. It is a known bug and safe to ignore.\n\nA: If you don't have a micro SD card or other storage connected via this device then just remove the device. The file manager may just be confused and tries to sync to the read only memory part of the device, which of course will fail. Just handle this device like a mouse or other non storage USB peripherals. You don't try to safely remove them, because there isn't even an option for doing so.\nBtw: No, 3G/LTE USB sticks are horrible, there are to much models out there, they look all the same and you don't know which one works and which does not and they look goofy, too. That's why they have to go away. Buy mobile hotspots instead.\n", "Q: A music player that can handle multiple artist tags The mp3 format can handle multiple artists per track (in the form of \"artist1\\artist2\"), and as far as I know other modern music formats can do the same thing. However, Rhythmbox (my default music player) seems to be capable of only reading the first artist. Are there any music players that can read and sort songs with multiple artists, or a plugin for Rhythmbox that can provide this functionality?\n\nA: Quod Libet will handle multiple values for pretty much any tag where supported by the format (e.g. mp3). It also knows about other person-like tags such as albumartist, performer and composer and has meta-tags for these.\n\nA: I found a workaround for those who use Rhythmbox, and I'm crossposting this from it's issue tracker:\nSince I use Picard for properly tagging albums BEFORE I import them into Rhythmbox (and also, before they're copyed into ~/music), I managed to find a workaround for this.\nPicard has a plugin (included out-of-the-box) called \"Feat. artists in titles\". The name is pretty self-explanatory. Here's an example:\nBefore:\ntitle: \"Some song\"\nartist: \"Artist 1 feat. Artist 2\"\n\nAfter:\ntitle: \"Some song feat Artist 2\"\nartist: \"Artist 1\"\n\nThis results in what we all expect in the artist list in Rhythmbox, etc.\nI already used picard to complete missing tags (sometimes the year is missing, etc, etc), so it's not really any hastle for me. It may not be the cleanest workaround, but it definitely works. I've yet to come any issue with this.\n", "Q: Trying to Mirror Screen on HD TV Trying to connect my laptop to an HD tv screen via an HDMI cable. It works for about 5 seconds and then the picture disappears on the tv and it turns black. Not only this but when the screen does show some parts are clipped off from the tv (including the start menu). How do I change the resolution, as under \"Display\" only one resolution is available for the SAMSUMG tv.\n Thanks\n\nA: Not sure why your screen goes black, but the clipping is due to overscan. Most HD TVs produce a picture which is larger than the displayed area so they don't get a black border when showing normal TV. When using as a monitor, this needs to be adjusted. I use 2 nettop PCs (1 Ubuntu, 1 Debian) with HD TV's as monitors to record and watch TV. The display adapter is NVIDIA which has an application (nvidia-settings) which can change the overscan. Depending on your adapter there should be a similar application to reset it.\n", "Q: Unable to install boot-repair I am trying to install Windows 7 on Ubuntu.

Do I need to do that manually, does the Windows Installer do it for me, or do I need to do it at all?\n\nA: The Best way is to create a partition with Windows CD for C drive. But make sure you have some unpartitioned space for Ubuntu. Boot from the Ubuntu CD and choose the option which says unused space. This will create a dual boot without loosing the data on your windows partition.  For more info on that see Installing Ubuntu Desktop\nIf you are installing using Wubi, Wubi will create a virtual partition.

Windows may destroy your Linux partition if you are not careful to specify a separate partition when running the installer. And Windows will definitely destroy GRUB (your boot manager). To be safe, I would install Windows first, then install Ubuntu. In other words, option 2.\nAlso, virtualization extensions aren't a requirement for Virtualbox if you wanted to go the virtualization route, they are just recommended and provide performance enhancements.\n\nA: There is no problem if Windows installation replaces GRUB in MBR. \nYou can always add a \"boot sector loader\" to Windows 7 boot manager and boot Linux/Unix from Windows.\nSee here how to dual boot Windows 7 with any Linux or Unix descendant like Fedora, Ubuntu or FreeBSD for example.\n", "Q: How can I bind alt-space to open Gnome-Do?

The problem I have is that I can't figure out how I should do to show a Gtk.Image in my app with an image file from the web.\nThis is as far as I have come:\nfrom gi.repository import Gtk\nfrom gi.repository.GdkPixbuf import Pixbuf\nimport urllib2\n\nurl = 'http://lolcat.com/images/lolcats/1338.jpg'\nresponse = urllib2.urlopen(url)\nimage = Gtk.Image()\nimage.set_from_pixbuf(Pixbuf.new_from_stream(response))\n\nI think everything is correct except the last line.\n\nA: According to the docs, new_from_stream() needs a Gio.InputStream and Gio.Cancellable as arguments.\nYou could also save the image on disk and remove when needed. Here is a very basic example:\nimport os\nimport urllib2\nfrom gi.repository import Gtk\nfrom gi.repository.GdkPixbuf import Pixbuf\n\n\ndef quit_event(widget, event):\n    os.remove(imgname)\n    Gtk.main_quit()\n\nimgname = '1338.jpg'\nurl = 'http://lolcat.com/images/lolcats/'+imgname\nresponse = urllib2.urlopen(url)\nwith open(imgname, 'wb') as img:\n    img.write(response.read())\n\nimage = Gtk.Image()\npb = Pixbuf.new_from_file(imgname)\nimage.set_from_pixbuf(pb)\n\nwindow = Gtk.Window()\nwindow.connect('delete-event', quit_event)\nwindow.add(image)\nwindow.show_all()\nGtk.main()\n\nYou should write to a better location though, maybe /tmp or a user-specified dir.\n", "Q: Recover broken window manager I'm running Ubuntu 12.04, 64 bit\nI noticed that \"compiz\" was eating 40% of one of my CPUs and wanted to find its configuration. After not being able to find anything in the \"Settings\" with words compiz or similar (I'm used to 11.04 where I had 3 settings for fanciness of animations etc) I started googling. Most suggestions say to do this:\ngconftool-2 --recursive-unset /apps/compiz\n\nor\ngconftool-2 --recursive-unset /apps/compiz-1\n\nI did the -1 action and my Unity closed. Restarting the computer does not bring any window manager back up. I get desktop with 2 icons, and no window manager.\nHow can I solve this?\nP.S\nShortcuts don't work. Alt-F2 does nothing, single tap on Alt, Ctrl, Super does nothing. To open a terminal I have to open a Desktop folder icon, then search for gnome-terminal in /usr/bin and open it that way. All windows that open up cannot be resized etc.\n\nA: Open up a terminal by browsing to /usr/share/applicationsin your file manager and double-clicking gnome-terminal.desktop. Now, run unity --reset.\n\nA: I had the similar problem in 14.10 . \nI solved it by deleting my ~/.config/dconf/user  and ~/.cache/compizconfig-1. It worked out for me, in case if it doesn't work out for you try installing a different window manager(in my case I had cinnamon and was able to use it smoothly even when I had problems in default window manager).\n", "Q: How to make your ubuntu filesystem read-only I wonder whether there is a way to make my ubuntu read-only when I mount it on another linux system. Let me clear what I want. I have a usb stick on where my ubuntu is installed. However, the problem is that I am able to change the files or folder on it by mounting it another ubuntu. How can I preserve it? \nThanks...\n\nA: If, as is likely, when you connect this drive to another Ubuntu machine, it is automatically mounted, you can quite simply remount it as read-only, so its files cannot be altered. In order to learn the /dev/ info and the /media location where it is mounted, simply type mount. Now, with that information, and without even unmounting the drive you wish to be read only, type:\nsudo mount -o remount,ro /dev/sdb1 /media/MDrive\nObviously, replace sdb1 and MDrive with the locations and names of your drive. If you ever need it to be writable again, type:\nsudo mount -o remount,rw /dev/sdb1 /media/MDrive\nThere is no way to write protect a hard disk, however, apart from encrypting the entire device.\n(If the external disk is not automounted, you will need to do the following: sudo mkdir /media/disk and then sudo mount -t vfat /dev/sdb1 /media/disk -o ro, again replacing vfat with whatever filesystem the disk uses, and /dev with your device node.)\n", "Q: Why am I getting \"size mismatch\" errors from the Iceland mirror? After installing Ubuntu 12.04 (clean install) I fetch a bunch of program via synaptic (installed specially), all programs worked except Gimp 2.8. So I tried purging Gimp, install again (no luck).

I have used se.archive instead, since it's net-wise pretty close (on Nordunet/Sunet).\nThe solution is to do:\nsudo sed -i.bak 's/is.archive/se.archive/g' /etc/apt/sources.list\n\nWhich switches your source of packages to Sweden.\nPlease note: All traffic destined for NORDUNET should be handled as domestic traffic (isl: ekkert útlandaniðurhal) since the traffic is routed through the RIX which is a domestic end-point for the telcos.\n", "Q: Creating Custom Short cut Keys Ubuntu 12.04 I used to have my own shortcut keys to minify all the CSS and JS files for my websites after I saved the original larger version of the file.

Anyone know what files to edit or what options screens to go through to complete this? Thanks in advance!\n\nA: Like carnendil has mentioned. There is a tab entitled, \"Shortcuts\" in the \"keyboard\" option from \"all settings\". Down to the left, there is the option, \"Custom Shortcuts\". Use (+) and (-) to add or remove shortcuts!\nFor instance, to add the shortcut for (System monitor), press (+), a small prompt will ask you to enter the short cut name and command,\nName: System monitor\nCommand: gnome-system-monitor\nAfter pressing apply, the short cut will be disabled.

It turns out to be an Ubuntu problem:\nhttps://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/linux/+bug/938630\n\nA: They should be alright. I'm getting a Dell, and I'm assuming since it's said to be one of the most UbuntuxWindows-boot-friendly computers, I'm fairly happy. But, saying this, it should be OK for both your VAIO(s) because it's an OS, and most computers built after something like 1995 should be able to dual boot fine.\nAs for which computer, personally I would go for the 13.3\" T series Customizable, because it has an i7 processor which will be quicker on both systems, plus 6GB of RAM, which is great for dual booting (if you do get Ubuntu on this one, I recommend the x64 version, if that is what your computer can handle.)\nBut overall, both should be OK, but I recommend the second one if it's not out of your budget.\n", "Q: Installer CD won't boot when installing Ubuntu Server 12.04 I downloaded the ISO file of Ubuntu Server 12.04 (both 64 and 32 bit) and I burnt the image to a blank DVD but the installer is not booting (even when I choose DVD-ROM as the first boot device). My motherboard is ASUS, my OS is Ubuntu Desktop.\n\nA: Maybe the ISO wasn't downloaded or burnt well.

Only the Minecraft process and for it to be reopened when Minecraft is closed? I'm very very new to Ubuntu 12.04 or Linux in general. Been learning as I go along.\n\nA: First I'll try to answer your question, then I'll explain why you probably shouldn't do it :)\nI haven't seen or heard of any shell scripts that would do this, but it will be relatively easy to write one yourself. Simply writing a shell scripts and in there pkill-ing the processes that you wouldn't need should do the trick, e.g.\n#!/bin/bash\npkill zeitgeist-fts\npkill dropbox\n\nIf you then make a second script to run the processes, e.g.\n#!/bin/bash\nzeitgeist-fts &\ndropbox &\n\n...you should be able to restart these processes (and to the more experienced folks on the website: please do edit if there is a better way to terminate/restart these processes). It might be better though to restart your session, e.g. log out or kill the X server, and that'll only take you a few seconds.\nNow, here's why I think you will be better off with an alternative solution.\nKilling too many of these processes is going to leave you with a system that will be unstable, unsecure and probably unusable. If you pkill Dropbox you'll be alright, but pkill Zeitgeist and your Unity process won't operate as it should. Be very careful with what processes you terminate. Also, some processes won't be allowed to terminate and will simply restart. I think it's best to let them be restarted. If you block Compiz for example, it might be very annoying to manually restart it when you need it.\nIt sounds like you need all your computer's resources to run Minecraft.To summarise, it might be a bad idea to simply strip down Ubuntu to free some resources. Instead, you will be better off using a lighter distro, such as Lubuntu or Xubuntu.\n", "Q: How to get my AE1000 adapter to work?

In the dash if I type eclipse or the name of the software it appears, But I am unable to right click on it and open the folder location. Does anyone know how to find where exactly a particular software is installed using the dash. Also is it possible to set  a software to be installed to a particular location when using the apt-get.\n\nA: Summary\n\n*\n\n*You shouldn't, and basically can't, make the package manager put any file anywhere except its default location.\n\n*You can find the location of just about any program (i.e., the executable file itself) with the command which filename or by searching in Nautilus.\n\nDetails\nYou cannot change the default locations to install software with apt-get, the Software Center, or the other package management tools in Ubuntu. You can manually retrieve packages and extract their files wherever you want, but you almost certainly wouldn't want to do that. Generally speaking, it's a hassle and there's typically no reason to do it.\n\n*\n\n*If you believe you would benefit from doing this, please add details to your question about why, an what you need to accomplish. The best way to do it would depend on that, plus there may be alternatives you haven't considered.\n\nPackages install files throughout the filesystem, mostly in different subdirectories of /usr. This is in accordance with the filesystem hierarchy standard which specifies where different kinds of files, associated with installed programs and libraries, are supposed to go in a GNU/Linux system (i.e., in a \"Linux distribution,\" like Ubuntu).\n\n*\n\n*The executable files themselves go mostly in /usr/bin. That's where the eclipse executable is installed when you install the eclipse package on Ubuntu.\n\n*Executable files for games often go in /usr/games instead.\n\n*Executable files for system services like NetworkManager usually go in /usr/sbin instead. (s stands for \"system\". These are \"system binaries.\")\n\n*Libraries mostly go in /usr/lib.\n\n*If you have a 64-bit Ubuntu system, 32-bit libraries (installed to support 32-bit executables, since a 64-bit system can run both 64-bit and 32-bit programs) mostly go in /usr/lib32.\n\n*Header files, which facilitate building software from source that links to installed libraries, mostly go in /usr/include. These files are provided by packages whose names end in -dev. The exception is the headers for building kernel modules--those go in /usr/src.\n\n*Source code installed for systemwide use for packages that provide it goes mostly in /usr/src. Header files for building kernel modules also go here.\n\n*Systemwide data files (i.e., not executable code, but data) for installed programs and libraries, when it is architecture-independent (for example, doesn't depend on whether you have a 32-bit or 64-bit processor), mostly go in /usr/share. Please note that this is for data files that remain unchanged except when the package itself is updated, not documents you create. For example, the master lists for spellchecker dicationaries (but not user-specific additions to them) will usually go in /usr/share.\n\n*Systemwide configuration files for virtually every package (and most software not installed through the package manager, too) go in /etc.\n\nYou'll notice I keep saying \"usually.\" This is because:\n\n*\n\n*Core system files, including the most essential programs and libraries for the system to function, don't go inside /usr. They go in the corresponding subdirectories of / itself. For example, core files that provide basic system utilities go in /sbin. Core system files that provide basic \"user\" utilities, like the shells provided by default with the system, go in /bin. Core libraries go in /lib. And so forth.\n\n*Occasionally a package may install files in some other location. The most common such place is /opt. The main purpose of /opt is to store (1) programs that choose not to spread their files around to the ordinary places in the filesystem heirarchy, but instead all in a single directory (whether or not these programs are installed using the package manager), and (2) programs installed by binary installers, not through the package manager, and don't have a package associated with them. (Programs installed for systemwide use by being built manually by the user from source code are ordinarily installed in the directories inside /usr/local.)\n\nThere are a few ways to search for executables and other files provided by Ubuntu packages.\n\n*\n\n*I don't know of a way to use the Unity Dash to tell you the location of a program in an accessible way. But you can accomplish this graphically with Nautilus, the graphical file browser.\n\n*\n\n*Open a Nautilus window and press Ctrl+F (or click Go > Search for Files...).\n\n*Type in what you're searching for (in this case, eclipse) and press Enter.\n\n*By default this will search just in the folder that is open in this particular Nautilus window. But you can change that. After searching, change the Location to Filesystem (or to wherever you want to search, you could even specify the custom search location /usr) and click Reload.\n\n\nThis is how you search for files on your system in general (i.e., not just those provided by Ubuntu packages), with the ability to get detailed information about them.\n\n\n*Using the Terminal (Ctrl+Alt+T), you can find executables like eclipse with which:\n  which eclipse\n\nwhich tells you which executable (if any) would be run if you typed eclipse and pressed enter in the Terminal. This is quite often, but not always, the same as the first search result when you search for the same thing in the Unity dash.\n\n\n*Using the Terminal, you can find files quickly with locate (as the database that keeps the list is updated periodically). This is especially good when you want to find a file that is provided by a package, but is not actually an executable.\n  locate eclipse\n\n\n\n*You can search through the files provided in Ubuntu packages at packages.ubuntu.com. There are other ways too.\n\nA: I fear it is not possible to do that from the dash. If you want to know where the executable path is, you can use the which command:\nwhich eclipse\n\nBut this will probably point to some \"bin\" directory, and not to the directory containing the data. That's because software components are not installed in a single directory, but across many folders. Binaries stay in /usr/bin/, /bin, /sbin, etc depending on their use. Configuration in /etc, data in /usr/share, etcetera.\nRefer to this document about Filesystem Hierarchy Standard and the reason while you usually don't have a single-folder installation. As apt follows FHS, as far as I know it is not possible to force it to install in different location.\nSo about where is eclipse installed, it depends on which part of eclipse you are searching for. A common need is to install plugins, which are stored under: /usr/lib/eclipse/plugins. I usually prefer the integrated plugin manager, anyway.\n", "Q: Time differences between windows and ubuntu partition? I'm running a tri-boot setup with Windows 7, ubuntu 12.04, and Backtrack 5 all running on separate partitions. When ever I boot into windows after linux the time is all messed up and I have to manually reset it. The same happens the other way around. How do I fix this? \nThanks!\n\nA: That's because Windows doesn't do UTC. Refer to this.\n\nA: \nChanging Linux to use local time is easier and more reliable than\n  changing Windows to use UTC, so dual-boot Linux/Windows systems tend\n  to use local time.\n\nThis is mentioned in the link provided.

I'm looking around for a way to program some gui apps in ubuntu 12.04.\nI ran across the quickly tutorial and the tool looks fantastic.\nIt looks like the primary language you develop with is python, which is fine with me.\nBut I know that I will need to link in C (or other compiled) code for intensive number crunching and to take advantage of the huge number of binary libraries out there.\nI understand that python is designed so that you can link c code into it (although I don't know anything about the details, such as whether it can be done dynamically, or whether you have to build a new python interpreter executable, etc).\nSo my question is whether it is possible to fit in linked C (or other compiled) code into the quickly workflow, and if you do, can you still build deb packages to distribute your code.  (I wouldn't mind writing a few makefiles or scripts or whatever to do this.)\nAnd are there any examples out there that I could take a look at?\n\nA: I think the short answer is no, Quickly was not designed to mix and match Python and C code.\nIf you are interested in this topic, I'd suggest reading the Python documentation on how to extend the language with C.\nMy suggestions would be though, to either:\n\n\n*\n\n*Write the application in Python, and benchmark the performance of your number-crunching routines. This will give you some data to decide whether Python is fast enough for your purposes, or\n\n*Write the application solely in C\n\n\nIf you want to link existing C libraries into Python code, you might also want to have a look at ctypes.

I can not partition the hard drive so here is my question, Can I install Ubuntu on the same hard drive as 2000? I desperately need to get all my items off of Windows, yet remain able to boot to it.\n\nA: No, you will no be able to install Ubuntu with Wubi when Windows is unable to boot. The Wubi installer is an .exe that needs to be run from a properly booted Windows.\nBut what you can do is to start Ubuntu from the CD choosing the option \"Try out Ubuntu\".

At install time I tried to call the name of my account 'root' which I was not allowed to do. So I used another name, but I still don't understand why certain actions are blocked and why password verification is needed on updates etc. \nI can understand this if there are multiple accounts on a machine and some users are set up without certain access privileges but on a single account what is the need for this? It seems pointless that I can login not as root but perform actions that require root privilege just by entering my password.\nIf all users can do this, what is the distinction between root access and other users access??? Am I missing something here?\n\nA: You should think of yourself as not one user, but two:\n\n\n*\n\n*Doing all your normal day to day usage of the machine\n\n*The administrator\n\n\nAs an administrator, you can carry out tasks which could damage data if you made a mistake. Also, if you are running as administrator and you connect to a malicious website that exploits your user account, the attacker could have your root privileges. If you are compromised when you are just running as a normal user, it is harder for an attacker to escalate to root.\nSo it's really about safety, from accidental or malicious incidents.\nGeneral rule - run as least privilege wherever possible\n\nA: It is the basic Underlying Security Feature of Ubuntu /Linux based system .\nYou can refer the detailed description on this subject from RootSudo community wiki\n\nThe SuperUser (Root)  can do anything and everything, and thus doing\n  daily work as the SuperUser can be dangerous. You could type a command\n  incorrectly and destroy the system. Ideally, you run as a user that\n  has only the privileges needed for the task at hand.......\n....Using sudo avoids the \"I can do anything\" interactive login by\n  default (e.g. the tendency by users to login as an \"Administrator\"\n  user in Microsoft Windows systems), you will be prompted for a\n  password before major changes can happen, which should make you think\n  about the consequences of what you are doing.\nsudo adds a log entry of the command(s) run (in /var/log/auth.log). If\n  you mess up, you can always go back and see what commands were run. It\n  is also nice for auditing.\n\n", "Q: Should I install 64-bit Ubuntu on my Lenovo Ideapad Y510 laptop? I have a Lenovo IdeaPad Y510 and I have Ubuntu 12.04 32 bit installed on it. I think my machine does support 64bit OS. Currently I have 1GB RAM and I am planning to upgrade it to 3-4 GB. After upgrading RAM can I install 64bit Ubuntu on my machine(for better performance as 64bit performs better than 32bit)? If yes then what this link is talking about RAM usage. I didn't get it all.\n\nA: If only for support of more RAM an upgrade to 64-bit is not needed. In case you did a fresh install of 12.04 32-bit (i.e. no upgrade) you will already have a 32-bit pae kernel installed that supports up to 64 GB of RAM.\nYou can not \"upgrade\" 32-bit to 64-bit Ubuntu without re-installing the OS. This however may not be too much trouble in case you keep your HOME. If you decide to do that please make a backup of your important data before you proceed.\nMy personal recommendation in case you are happy with your installation, and you don't need to run 64-bit-only applications, would be to just leave your OS as it is. This is the least hazard to your data.\n", "Q: Why is this command that is in my PATH not being found?

I used the universal installer to prepare my 4GB HP pendrive to boot and install Ubuntu. \n\n\nWhat I see inside the pendrive is this within a FAT32 filesystem:\n\nI did this all from an user account that is not the admin account. I don't think this should be relevant but mention it just in case.\nFinally, I restarted the computer, hit F12 and choose boot from USB drive. \nNext, I saw was a black screen with a this sign \"_\" on the top left corner and the led on the pendrive looked active.

I finally burned the iso image on a dvd and made the install from there without problems.\n\nA: Where did you download your iso from? Normally you should get the same thing if you downloaded it straight off the Ubuntu site. Although your image seems to point out that you have the right files, although I have noticed you have some different ones to my USB installer, although I was installing from XP I don't think that should change much this is what I've got: \nI'm guessing you mounted it correctly but did you try mounting it with Pendrivelinux?

You can show some message(or write to log file) like:\nmount <partition> /mnt/controlurg || eval 'echo \"Error mounting partition\" 1>&2; exit 1'\n\nmount <partition> /mnt/controlurg || eval 'echo \"Error mounting partition\\n\" >> mount.log; exit 1'\n\nTo kill all processes use killall command.\n", "Q: Will Ubuntu allow me to play games like I do in Windows? I was wondering if Ubuntu would let me play games like a Windows7 computer would.\nie:Team Fortress 2, Minecraft, etc\n\nA: Simple answer: No. You can get some to run, but a lot more won't run, many will also run badly. If gaming is a priority for you, the easiest fix is to just dual boot into Windows. If you are really lucky, the handful of games you care about might run in Linux (e.g. Minecraft does).\n\nA: Ubuntu can run Minecraft, or any other Java based game natively, as long as you have Java installed onto your machine\nJust right click on the installer and choose to open the file with either (whichever you have installed) the Open JDK or the Oracle Java versions\nWith most other game binries, it needs to be emulated inside a package called Wine, which emulates the Windows repositories so that the program thinks it is running in Windows. The link to the download and install page for Ubuntu is here\nFor flash games you need a browser to be able to run them\n\nA: Depends a lot on the games you want to run and on your graphics card driver.\nUbuntu depends on Wine to run Windows native software, Wine emulates a virtual environment while allowing the programs to access your system's hardware directly. Wine is not perfect and will not run everything, to check if an application can run in Wine using Ubuntu please visit the WineHQ page and search for the software you want to run.\nIf your graphics card can use OpenGL and the used drivers for your card are installed and active then there should not be much of an issue there. Again, depends on the hardware you have installed and the driver you are going to use.\nWhile Wine is the backend that allows you to play games on Ubuntu some tricks might be needed to make a couple of programs/games run, developers have made it easy for you to install such software using a frontend for Wine, one of those is PlayOnLinux.\nWhat it does is you will choose the application from a list that you want installed on your Ubuntu system, POL will then apply any other necessary applications to a Wine bottle and then install the application itself, most of the times that is all that it is necessary.\nPlayOnLinux  (click on the link) is probably the easiest free way of installing Windows software in your Ubuntu system.\nNothing is 100% prof using Wine, so the easiest way to testing if an application runs in your Ubuntu system is really giving it a try. Both applications that you gave as an example in your post run and have good support in Wine, it should not take much of an effort for you to install them in your system.\n\nA: You have to install it through Wine ,both are rated as GOLD  as here\nTeam Fortress 2\nand Minecraft \nFor other details read this\nFor list of other games that are available see http://appdb.winehq.org/ \n\nA: As well as running some Windows games in Wine (as people have been talking about), there are some great native Linux games that will run well if you have full opengl acceleration for your graphics drivers. In the repositories, ready for install, there is a great game called Alien Arena, which uses the crx game engine and has impressive visuals. There are quite a few other shooters like this available and most such as Nexuiz (again in the repos) can be played online. \nNeverwinter nights can be run natively on Linux and not just through wine, but it takes a while to set up and there isn't space to go into it here; however, there is a launcher which might work with some versions of the game, or, more likely, you may need to set it up manually, as I did for a friend.\nA lot of games can be played in the browser now as well, a notable one being quake live, and there are many other ones available, which other answers have mentioned.\n(I won't mention much about Dosbox or scummvm, as I think you said you want to play more modern games, but those emulators are available in the repositories and support many old games)\n", "Q: Nvidia drivers with GeForce 680M problem \nPossible Duplicate:\nThere's an issue with an Alpha/Beta Release of Ubuntu, what should I do? \n\nI have a new Alienware M17x which I have installed 64-bit Ubuntu 12.10 (dual boot).

It's possible that the filesystem is smaller by a wide enough margin to make it fit entirely on the disk. If so, deleting the partition in gdisk and re-creating it with a smaller size may fix things. You'll need to figure out the precise size of the filesystem, though. Perhaps one of the Linux NTFS utilities can provide this information, but offhand I'm not sure precisely how to do this.\nAlso note that it's partition #2 (/dev/sdb2) that contains the filesystem, not /dev/sdb1 or /dev/sdb. If you've been using either of the latter two identifiers in Linux, that could explain the error messages you've been getting. If you try /dev/sdb2 and it starts working, though, don't ignore the partition table problem; it's likely to come back and bite you!\n", "Q: Are there any tweaks for fixing the appearance of Eclipse Juno on ubuntu? As we have previously established ;-) running Eclipse on ubuntu is a bit disappointing on the UI side. Things are even worse now that Juno is out. Are there any tweaks specific to Gtk3 and Juno that help make things better? \nThe new UI maybe needs some getting used to, but I'm not convinced.

I have a small USB HD I've bought for doing daily backups, which has an encfs system on it.\nI've got an autorun script in the root that does a couple of things including mounting the enc-FS and that part works fine.\nHowever if I forget to fusermount -u the enc-FS -before ejecting it, there is no warning about anything and the USB dismounts, leaving the encFS part apparently still mounted.

Around the same time I did 2 systems for others with the the same Ubuntu versions and they always shut down just fine.  After trying some things in the O/S every now and then, nothing worked. I finally went into the BIOS under Power Management and shut off everything except leaving base ACPI enabled. Otherwise cool'n'quiet wouldn't work. I did change an S1 setting to S3, disabled everything else(except the base ACPI settting) and changed the control from BIOS to O/S(I figured this way after linux shuts down it won't have any ability to start the system but BIOS still may be able to). After I did these things it finally would shut off -after dealing with this for over 2 and a half years! It's really quite ridiculous but in my case, the blame seems to lie with an MSI motherboard.

It says in How many maximum CPUs does Ubuntu support by default?\nthat there is a maximum number of 8 cores supported by default in Ubuntu 12.04 Desktop/Server 32-Bit. What is the way to increase the maximum number of cores from the default of 8 to a higher value, like 12?\nThe reason I ask is because I have just built a machine with 6 hyper threading cores.  There were issues installing the 64-bit version of the software from a CD (it \"panicked\" and crashed several times).  The 32-bit installed with no problem, but I only see 8 of the 12 cores.  The BIOS is fine.  If I turn hyper-threading off and reboot, I see 6 cores as expected.\nI am nervous to try and compile a kernal, I am still new to all of this.  Is there a config setting somewhere that I should change?\n\nA: It appears that in /usr/src/linux-source-3.2.0/debian.master/config/i386/config.common.i386, from the linux-source-3.2.0 package, the maximum number of CPUs on 32-bit is set to 8, set with CONFIG_NR_CPUS=8 in that file.\nThis is perhaps a bug, though you really should be using the 64-bit version, which does have the max number of CPUs configured to 256. The 64-bit installer should not be crashing. If it is, it could be a bad CD write, or possibly bad hardware, which the 32-bit installer doesn't hit due to small differences in how the hardware is used.\nIf you do wish to use 32-bit with more than 8 CPUs, it looks like you will need to recompile the kernel, after changing the config, or file a bug report and wait for a fix to get released as an update (assuming there isn't some very good reason for limiting it to 8, and it won't be changed; though it seems like the -pae kernel should have this higher than 8, even if the non-pae one doesn't).\n", "Q: Sendmail account for sending e-mail on Ubuntu I've got a clean installation of Ubuntu with Webmin running Sendmail.\nI've got a domain mail.my-domain.com pointing at that server.\nI want to make a SMTP account for sending out e-mails, such as account-name@my-domain.com.\nHow do I do this?\nFor the record, I've tried a lot of Google searching etc. but no tutorial, documentation etc. that I could find showed a simple step-by-step to this simple setup :(\n\nA: You don't really need to create any account to send messages from sendmail, you can send from pretty-much-about-anything@my-domain.com.

If you use sudo apt-get build-dep vim-athena, it probably will install GTK+ and GNOME related libraries, because the vim-athena binary package is built from the same source package as vim and other vim-providing packages.

It's like cropping your office desk in pieces; each piece is the same as the other and you can run different procedures at each.\nHowever everything you change at each workspace will remain untouched and not effect the other workspaces.

There was no package virtualbox-guest-additions available  on the guest, so I installed\n$ sudo apt-get install virtualbox-guest-dkms\n\ninstead, which also pulled in dkms, fakeroot, virtualbox-guest-utils, and virtualbox-guest-x11.

Update Virtual Box to the current version (at present 4.1.18).\n\n*If all fails you can also download and install the ready-built guest additions from the repositories (these will also run with the PUEL version of Virtual Box but they may be out-dated in some aspects) by running the following in the guest Ubuntu:\n sudo apt-get install virtualbox-guest-additions\n\n\nA: First of all find your kernel version by:\n$ uname -a\nLinux ibm **3.5.0-24**-generic #37-Ubuntu SMP Thu Feb 7 01:50:30 UTC 2013 x86_64 x86_64 x86_64 GNU/Linux\n\nNext update apt by:\n$ sudo apt-get update\n\nFinally install your kernel version (3.5.0-24) header package by apt\n$ sudo apt-get install linux-headers-3.5.0-24-generic\n\n", "Q: MaaS install 64-bit client nodes doesn't work I have installed a MaaS node that will act as the parent and I am trying to add additional nodes via the PXE boot. The nodes boot fine and get an image from the MaaS server but they only install the 32-bit version. They are 64-bit machines and I would really like them to use the 64-bit version of Ubuntu Precise.

The reason a 64bit client is not being installed in this particular case, is because the installation process that seems to be using i386 is not really an installation process.\nWhat's happening here is that the client Machine is trying to enlist itself into 'MAAS', and it uses a i386 image.

Websites are usually written in HTML, CSS, JavaScript and PHP, while applications on Ubuntu typically are written in Python, C, C++, Java, etc. Therefore I'm pretty sure it's impossible to turn your application into a website without rewriting it.\n\nA: Like Daniel already explained to you, desktop applications are completely different in the code. In your case, you've used Python to code and Glade to design the window of your application.\nWeb applications are basically websites that are heavy JavaScript coded.\nPython as the programming language can't be used in websites, and your applications GUI is made in Glade, which means it's GTK based XML file. Websites use HTML + CSS to make things visible to you. Lets say their \"GUI\" is made in the combination of those two, which aren't the same as XML files native desktop applications are using.\nYou would need to rewrite the code in JavaScript, make a webpage and embed it into a WebKit made with Python and GTK. That's in the case you want it to look a bit like a native app, or use that new Ubuntu WebApp feature that has been released earlier this week.\n", "Q: Keyboard cursor loses focus when I'm typing When I'm typing a text in OpenOffice on Ubuntu 11.10/12.04 using the keyboard of Dell Inspirion 1525, the cursor loses focus and I start to typing in another place on screen.\n\nA: This is very likely because your hand brushes the touch pad while you're typing.\nIf you pull up the settings dialog (I think you can click the cog thing up in the top right and then click settings or control center or something along those lines ... alternatively, hit the super/windows key and start typing \"settings\" and it should show up) you can go to the \"Mouse and Touchpad\" section.

I am using HDMI audio out to a Panasonic TV. HTPC is running Ubuntu 12.04 LTS with MythTV 0.25. In most applications I get an intermittent, metallic buzz noise every 10 to 12 seconds. The noise lasts for a second or less each occurrence.\nThe noise is audible through any application except MythTV. As a result, I'm confident it isn't a physical problem or any particular media file (the same mp3 will sound fine when played with MythTV, but will buzz with Rhythmbox).\nI've spent a lot of time playing around with my .asoundrc file (some reading suggested a resampling issue) and a few snd-hda-intel models.\nAfter having spent hours on this issue, I am hoping someone who knows more about alsa and HDMI can tell me if I'm at least on the right path or if I should be looking somewhere else for the resolution. Honestly, I'd be happy if I could just get Hulu Desktop to stop making the noise (in addition to MythTV). For instance, since I launch Hulu Desktop from MythTV, can it somehow inherit MythTV's audio settings?\nThanks for your time!\n\nA: Although I am not yet running Ubuntu, I just had a similar problem with HDMI audio (analog audio worked fine) on my system (F17/KDE, Asus P8Z77-V, i5 CPU with HD4000 graphics, Panasonic TV), so I wish to share my findings:\nGoogling the problem bought me here, prompting to install mythtv (0.25.2). There at the advanced audio settings forcing the audio device (set to ALSA:hdmi...) to output 48 kHz made the buzzing go away as regards mythtv - probably similar to what you experienced.\nAs I have pulseaudio installed, the solution - at least for mplayer, vlc and mythtv -  was to set the default sampling rate to 48 kHz in /etc/pulse/daemon.conf (I do not have a PA config file in my home directory).\n\nBefore that I did some experimenting with ALSA and mplayer addressing the HDMI device without PA (suspending PA with the command pacmd and entering suspend 1): the problem persisted until I used the option -srate 48000 in mplayer (with PA active -srate did not help as the default sampling rate for PA is 44100 Hz).\nIn my case I did not need to set the (re-)sampling rate for ALSA, but if you still want to experiment with it, please bear in mind that an active PA can have an influence on the final sampling rate at your sound device. This rate you can see by checking out /proc/asound/cardX/pcmXp/subX/hw_params while playing audio (for me cat /proc/asound/card0/pcm7p/sub0/hw_params worked).\n", "Q: add apps to top panel in ubuntu 12.04 Is there any way to add any app I wish to the top panel in Ubuntu 12.04? e.g, I have dropbox, mail, wireless and sound icons there.

The installation went almost perfectly; Internet connections and graphics were all configured fine (which is more than I can say for the Windows 7 I've just installed on a dual boot).\nHowever, when I unplug the power supply, there is no battery indicator displayed. In the power settings, there is only one column; I've seen screenshots indicating that I should see two columns, one for \"On battery power\" and one for \"When plugged in\". There is also no field \"When power is critically low\". \nI can use the laptop on battery power, but it just keeps running on full power until it suddenly switches off. It seems like the OS doesn't \"know\" it's on a laptop.\nI installed Windows 7 yesterday on dual boot and that configured the power supply perfectly (unlike most of the other hardware).\nI reinstalled 12.04 this morning and the problem persists.\nThe problem is there in both Unity and Gnome.\n\nA: Install dconf Editor via the terminal:\nsudo apt-get install dconf-tools\n\nor using the Software Center:  \n\nThen perform the action indicated in the screenshot below:\n\n", "Q: How to add unused partition of the first disk to /home in the second disk I have two ssd disks, Disk B is devoted to /home, and disk A is the filesystem and is 90% empty. \nSo I made on disk A a partition /dev/sda3 with 80% of the free space.

I'm new to Linux Ubuntu. I was using ChromePlus in Windows 7, it also has a Linux version. So I downloaded it. It's a chromeplus*.tar.gz file. I use the command tar xvzf chromeplus*.tar.gz to unzip the file and got a bunch of files. I really have no idea about how to run the chrome browser. Is it installed already or I need more steps? There's no ./configure and read-me file.\n\nA: From what I see, what you have downloaded is a compressed precompiled binary. You can start it by going to the folder where you have extracted it and double-clicking on chrome or typing ./chrome if you are in terminal. However, on my system it complains about a missing library file:\n./chrome: error while loading shared libraries: libplc4.so.0d: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory\n\nI have managed to fix this error by copying three of these files from /usr/lib/firefox (without the .0d) extension and to /usr/lib with the added .0d extension.

The title says it all; my 12.04 server box will only decrypt and mount my home directory if I log in over SSH. Last night I needed some data off my server but I had left my laptop with my private keys at work. I logged in directly at the box and to my surprise my home directory was empty.\nReading up on the subject, I learned about how eCryptfs works and its directory structure. Sure enough, I found the hidden .ecryptfs and .private directories in my home folder. The .private folder appeared to contain the correct number of files and directories, but with their names obfuscated by encryption obviously. However, no matter what I tried I couldn't mount the directory. I tried:\n\n\n*\n\n*Manually invoking 'ecryptfs-mount-private'\n\n*Use 'sudo' a few times to make sure password has been supplied\n\n*Add 'ecryptfs-mount-private' to the end of .profile\n\n*Tried 'ecryptfs-recover-private', which found my encrypted home but when mounted as RO at /tmp was empty\n\n\nAfter a few hours I figured that my files had somehow been corrupted and lost. Nothing super important stored there, so it wasn't a huge loss, but still irritating.\nThis morning I get to work and on a hunch log in over SSH to my server at home. Sure enough, my files are there and intact. In other words, ecryptfs is only mounting my encrypted home over SSH.\nThis seems completely opposite to what I've found questions about; most people log in over SSH and then wonder why their files aren't there. I haven't done any crazy configuration, other than the necessary storage of 'authorized_keys' at /etc/ssh/[user] so sshd can read it. This box was originally set up on 11.10 and during installation I elected for encrypted home directories. The recent update to 12.04 appeared to go smoothly and I didn't notice any problems.\nsshd is currently set up with:\n\n\n*\n\n*SSH protocol 2\n\n*aes256-ctr encryption\n\n*ecdh-sha2-nistp521 key exchanges\n\n*hmac-sha2-512 message authentication\n\n*521-bit ecdsa keys for server and clients\n\n*password logins disabled\n\n*all types of forwarding/tunneling disabled\n\n*PAM disabled\n\n\nI can't really detail my eCryptfs setup because I haven't changed anything there; encryption was set up with the defaults implemented by the Ubuntu installation. Any ideas?\n\nA: My comment above is the correct answer. Apparently writing everything out and then reading over it made something click in my head. Should anyone else find this with a similar problem, check to see what happens when you mount and unmount your private folder with 'ecryptfs-mount-private' and 'ecryptfs-umount-private' respectively. Each should reflect as a change in files displayed in your home directory. As ecryptfs prompts, you need to cd to /home/my_user to see the change reflected.\nIn my case to \"fix\" the problem I need to:\n\n\n*\n\n*Log in over SSH as normal\n\n*Copy all contents of '~' to another location\n\n*Edit '~/.profile' to add 'ecryptfs-mount-private' at the end (prompts for password to decrypt home after successful SSH login)\n\n*Use 'ecryptfs-mount-private' to mount encrypted home\n\n*Change directory to home, even if it's the current directory (cd /home/my_user)\n\n*Copy files back into home directory\n\n*Profit!\n\n", "Q: How do I disable an update of a single item?

Booting to recovery console and reinstalling the proprietary drivers solves the problem.\nIs there any way to tell the update manager to never update/overrun the devdrivers?\nIt's really a pain having to reinstall the drivers every time I update the system.\n\nA: Well, really only every time you update the kernel, so either turn off kernel updates (purge the package linux-generic-pae) or add in your install script to /etc/kernel-img.conf which runs when the kernel updates.  Really though, how much trouble are you going to go to to avoud a \"make install\".\n", "Q: Is it safe to delete a lost+found folder?

It takes up about 5gigs\nIs it safe to remove a lost and found folder?\n\nA: fsck will recreate the lost+found directory if it is missing.\nOn startup most distributions run fsck if the filesystem is detected as not being unmounted cleanly.\nAs fsck creates the lost+found directory if it is missing, it will create it then and place anything that it finds into that directory.\nSo you can remove it but not recommended (as per Marcelo comment).\n\nA: You don't want to delete the lost+found directory.\nIt is an important system folder and will be recreated on next boot anyway. There is some pretty good explanation of why it is there and what it does here\n\nA: So far I was under the impression that deleting lost+found was perfectly safe, as it would be recreated by fsck whenever it is needed. But after the Ubuntu 12.10 upgrade I got this mail from cron:\n/etc/cron.daily/standard:\n\nSome local file systems lack a lost+found directory. This means if the\nfile system is damaged and needs to be repaired, fsck will not have\nanywhere to put stray files for recovery. You should consider creating\na lost+found directory with mklost+found(8).\n\nThe following lost+found directories were not available:\n\n/home/lost+found\n\nThe man-page of mklost+found says:\nmklost+found pre-allocates disk blocks to the lost+found directory\nso that when e2fsck(8) is being run to recover a filesystem, it does \nnot  need to allocate blocks in the filesystem to store a large number\nof unlinked files.  This ensures that e2fsck will not have to allocate\ndata blocks in the filesystem during recovery.\n\nI am not sure what exactly that means, but it seems to indicate that not having lost+found might cause trouble on recovery. Furthermore it indicates that lost+found different from a regular directory in that it has preallocated blocks associated with it.\n", "Q: Cannot get hidden GRUB2 menu to appear?

So the quick way how to change multiple file associations in Dolphin would be to copy all the lines under [Default Applications] (set with xdg-mime) and paste them to the same file with [Added Associations] before them instead. Most likely works the same with Konqueror and everything else using kde-open.\n", "Q: How do I make an ISO from a disc? I have a disc here, and I need to take an ISO image of the disc. Is there a piece of software I can use to get the image from the disc, or does Ubuntu ship with one?\n\nA: While Brasero is probably easier, if you're interested, here's how to create an iso from the command line using mkisofs:\ngenisoimage -r -J -o cd_image.iso /directory\n\nThe -r and -J tags allow for long filenames. -o stands for output, followed by the output file and directory. Afterwards, you can mount the image using mount, or burn with wodim.\nThe Community Help Wiki for Ubuntu is a fantastic resource. Take a look at the link for more details. \n\nA: Graphical apps such ad Brasero or K3b should work fine for creating an iso from a disk, but there are actually several ways of doing it. I have always used the slightly more complicated, but for my old hardware, more reliable, way that uses dd/if. If you are confident doing it this way (or old fashioned), it has always worked for me:\n\n\n*\n\n*First place the disk in your drive and get the block and volume size with \nisoinfo -d -i /dev/sr1 \n\nor whatever the /dev node is for your target drive.\n\n\n*\n\n*Next run the following, replacing the /dev node with your own and place the block and volume numbers gained from isoinfo where <isoinfo result> occurs below:\ndd if=/dev/sr1 bs=<isoinfo result> count=<isoinfo result> of=/home/mike/Folder/thegreat.iso \n\n(Some example values reported by isoinfo for a physical disk are: \"Logical block size is: 2048, Volume size is: 309669\". So, in the dd/if commands above, bs would be 2048 and count would be 309669. Do not use these values, however, use the ones isoinfo gives for your own disk.) \nAlso make sure you use the correct /dev node of your cd/dvd drive, eg. usually /dev/sr0, /dev/sr1. \nEven though most people use graphical apps, I found that the dd/if method worked more reliably than brasero for me.\n\nI have prepared a script for making an iso from a disc.\nAs I use positional parameters in the script, you must specify the device ($1) and the iso to be created ($2), \nAs an example, if it is not in your ~/bin, you could call it with:\n./script_name.sh /dev/sr0 /home/$USER/new.iso\n\nThe contents of the script; make it executable with chmod u+x after creating it.\n#!/bin/bash\n\n# $1 and $2 are specified on the command line when the script is called; $1 must be /dev/sr0 or whatever is the drive; $2 is the location and name of iso to be created\n\nval1=\"$(isoinfo -d -i \"$1\" | grep -i \"block size\" | awk -F ': ' '{print $2}')\"\nval2=\"$(isoinfo -d -i \"$1\" | grep -i \"volume size\" | awk -F ': ' '{print $2}')\"\n\ndd if=\"$1\" bs=\"$val1\" count=\"$val2\" of=\"$2\"\n\nexit 0\n\n\nA: Default burner app in ubuntu Brasero can do that. It is shipped with ubuntu.\nChoose Copy CD/DVD option. In properties you choose the type (.iso)\n\nA: Use Brasero Disc Burner:\n\nOr via the terminal, run the following command.\nsudo apt-get install brasero\n\n\nTo copy a disc to an ISO image, click on Disc copy, then choose Image File as the destination.\n\nA: I always liked using dvdisaster, as it gracefully handles bad (scratched) CDs.\nIt was actually written to recover data from bad CDs, but it nicely works with good readable CDs too.\n", "Q: How to enable javascript on xdg-open I am trying to open a url using xdg-open but the terminal says,\n\nSo how do I enable the javascript?\n\nA: That message is not from xdg-open. It is from whatever application was used to open the URL. As you are using it over SSH, it isn't opening a graphical web browser, and instead appears to be opening the URL in a console based web browser, which either does not support JavaScript or has the feature disabled.\nYou will need to use a browser which supports JavaScript, or enable the feature if it is disabled.\n", "Q: Nautilus is really slow  Nautilus used to be lightning fast.Now it's dead slow.\nI have tried upgrading the video card but that does not seem to be the problem.\nAlso I found that there was a problem with the Dropbox uninstall, finally I replace it with pcmanfm which appears to be much faster but the down side is that I no longer have the gwibber social client and a lot of stuff don't work like they use to.\nAlso I completely removed nautilus and couldn't even login to ubuntu to install again nautilus.How can I remove or repair nautilus, and use pcmanfm instead?\nI have a dell inspiron 1440 3gb ram / disk 300gb /\nAdditionally, why does nautilus run fast when I run it as root?\nThere are no USB devices attached to my computer.\nThanks in advance\n\nA: I think you sould might install PCManFM (File Manager like Nautilus), it's the default file manager on Lubuntu, it's is \"lightning fast\" and it's interface looks like Nautilus.\nYou can install it from the Terminal with:\n$ sudo apt-get install pcmanfm\n\n\nA: You may try to launch nautilus from terminal, and if you would see the fallowing samba error:\n\"net usershare info\" but it failed: 'net usershare' returned error 255: net usershare: cannot open usershare directory /var/lib/samba/usershares.

For me I solved it by removing a symbolic link on the root directory which pointed to a network mount (smbfs) that wasn't reachable at the time.

Thanks.\n\nA: Wicd packages do not conflict with Network Manager. You can have both of them installed at the same time; this was requested by someone who wanted to use one for his VPN and the other for his Wifi. Just don't use them on the same interface, as they would step on each other's toes.\nThe packages did conflict in jaunty and karmic (I think, I may have gotten the versions wrong). Even then, you could have switched without losing your configuration. There are two ways to uninstall a package: you can remove it or purge it. Removing uninstalls the package but leaves the configuration files in place; purging also removes the configuration files in /etc even if you've modified them. When a package is automatically uninstalled due to a conflict, it is removed, not purged.\n\nA: What I would like to recoment you is to try stop network-manager and connect to you network through terminal. If everything ok than you should try wicd else - search for drivers.\nDepending to your OS version it doesn't remove network-manager or can ask you what to do.\n", "Q: Are CentOS programs compatible with Ubuntu?

While Ubuntu is based on Debian.  \nPackage will not be portable between them. However systems are almost the same, software developed for one can usually easily be compiled for the other, it just has to be compiled and packaged a little differently.\n\nBut using Alien you probably can.

I selected to install EN (not my native language, but I want EN) and Ubuntu started downloading all Arabic and some Chinese for all LibreOffice apps and gnome ... annoying.\nNow Ubuntu looks just fine, I got Web GL running, but all screen is flickering and my mouse cursor randomly stucking, Virtualbox made my Ubuntu crash. When I open Chromium, it all becomes laggy for a while. Flash videos and whole youtube looks terrible and laggy. Also trying to run HD Video (1080p) makes Ubuntu so laggy and that video as well. In default Movie Player HD video is laggy and low quality. Of course I use VLC Media Player (the best one for me) and there the video runs just fine, but I have very bad feeling when watching it, it is kind of slow like all Ubuntu and sometimes it got stuck.\nI also tried 3D benchmark (the gears on the sides of a cube) and spent a lot of time messing with Terminal and trying some configs, nothing helped.

In one hour I scouted through all preinstalled programs in Ubuntu, also made all Ubuntu One Accounts and so.\nNow I only want to make it running fast! Please help me.\n\nA: The short answer is: get an Nvidia card.\nThe long answer: as the proprietary drivers as made available by AMD do often vary in quality with every GPU they make, one can't really rely on them. Ubuntu ships with opensource drivers that are developed as a component of the Linux kernel. Unfortunately, they have not reached a state that is anywhere near finished, nor can you expect them to perform like the AMD drivers.\nI find your CPU to be slightly underpowered as well, especially when you're looking into virtualization.\nThose hours your computer spent downloading language packs may indicate a slow internet connection. \nConsider switching to a desktop environment that is less graphically demanding. First try, select \"Ubuntu 2d\" from the menu that hides behind the Ubuntu logo button.\n\nA: You may be better off with a 32bit installation. With only 2GB of RAM, you're not actually benefiting from the 64bit system. It's likely that applications and Ubuntu itself have larger memory footprints which further minimize available RAM than they would if you just had a 32bit install.\nFrom: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/32bit_and_64bit#Which_is_Better_-_32_or_64_Bits.3F\n\nIf you are doing heavy work where you have started to hit the 4GB\nmemory barrier, then 64-bit is for you. Certain intensive tasks such\nas encoding video or audio also run significantly faster on 64-bit\noperating systems (NOTE: this is implementation specific).\nSome applications such as Flash do run slower in 64-bit mode, however\nwork continues to improve on this.\n\nThere's further discussion available here: https://wiki.ubuntu.com/64BitTeam/64BitAdvantages\nLastly, if UI responsiveness is your primary concern, consider using an alternative shell like XFCE instead of Unity as this is also an area where memory usage is high.\nOn my system, watching a movie and having firefox open on a 32bit install with a few indicator apps and dropbox is using 2GB of RAM (Your memory limit).\nAlternatively, consider installing more RAM it would probably be a good \"bang for the buck\" upgrade.\n", "Q: Awesome WM menu missing Firefox After sudo apt-get install awesome awesome-extra and logging into it (with no previous configuration that I know of), there's no menu entry for Firefox. All my other stuff is there - Mutt, Meld, jEdit, BOINC, etc., only Firefox is missing. I have no ~/.config/awesome/ directory, so there should be no override in place.\n\nA: Try the menubar instead. It's mapped to modkey + p in the default config, and appears to be built using .desktop files:\nlocal menubar = require(\"menubar\")\n...\nawful.key({ modkey }, \"p\", function() menubar.show() end)\n\n\nA: By default on Ubuntu, when you install Awesome, you'll get some menu items coming from the Debian menu system.  This is because the default rc.lua has near the top: require(\"debian.menu\") and then later in rc.lua, under the code laying out the menu, you'll see:\nmymainmenu = awful.menu({ items = {  [stuff snipped]\n                                    { \"Debian\", debian.menu.Debian_menu.Debian },\n                                     [stuff snipped]\n                                   }\n                        })  \n\nThis means your browser(s) will be located at: \"Debian\" --> \"Applications\" --> \"Network\" --> \"Web Browsing\".  Some apps, however, may not install a Debian menu item.  Firefox, for example, seems to no longer have one.\nHaving said all that, I think it's preferable to just set up your own menus, because the Debian menu will have all kinds of stuff from different desktop environments you've installed.  The Debian menu system is also considered rather outdated, even by the Debian developers.  Here's a a quick read of the basics of how to set up menus in Awesome.  If you want to see how I set up my menus, you can take a look at my rc.lua linked in my profile.  \n\nA: I'm a little late on the reply here - but I found this question while having the same problem and thought I'd put my fix here for anyone else:\nIf you copy your /etc/xdg/awesome  file to ~/.config/awesome then look in the debian directory, there is a menu.lua there.\nOpen the file and find\nDebian_menu[\"Debian_Applications_Network\"] = {\n-- whatever elements are already there\n}\n\nand add the element\n{ \"Web Browsing\", Debian_menu[\"Debian_Applications_Network_Web_Browsing\"] },\n\nto that list.\nThen you can find where Debian_menu[\"Debian_Applications_Network_File_Transfer\"] menu is and add another menu after it (so it's easy to find later)\nDebian_menu[\"Debian_Applications_Network_Web_Browsing\"] = {\n{\"Firefox\", \"/usr/bin/firefox\"},\n}\n\nThen quit awesome and log back in and you should have Firefox in your menu.\nNOTE: I put /usr/bin/firefox as that is where my executable for firefox is - to find where yours is type which firefox in the command line.\n", "Q: Mount /usr on new partition \nPossible Duplicate:\nHow to move /usr to a new partition? \n\nI use Ubuntu 11.04.\ndf\nFilesystem           1K-blocks      Used Available Use% Mounted on\n/dev/sda1              9611492   7553508   1569744  83% /\nnone                   1665832       644   1665188   1% /dev\nnone                   1672460      1436   1671024   1% /dev/shm\nnone                   1672460       648   1671812   1% /var/run\nnone                   1672460         0   1672460   0% /var/lock\n/dev/sda3             67285624  19445284  44422384  31% /home\n\nIm starting to be a bit short on / partition. I have a lot of free space on my disk.\n\nI would like to mount /usr and /opt on new partitions without loosing the data. But I have no idea of how doing this.\nCan you help me.\n\nA: It's probably easiest to do by booting from a Live CD, i.e. boot from the install and select to test Ubuntu.\nOnce booted, open a terminal up and create new partitions for /usr and for /opt, although you may not have much in there. These will need to be logical partitions soyou'll need to create an extended partition (/dev/ada4) first.\nYou'll need several temporary mount points, so I usually create subdirectories in /mnt (e.g. /mnt/root, /mnt/usr and /mnt/opt) copy the existing contents across, then edit the existing fstab (which will be in /mnt/root/etc/fstab) to mount the new /usr and /opt.\nSequence of commands is (UNTESTED!!!) in Live CD terminal is roughly:\n# fdisk /dev/sda\n.... create new partitions. 4 (extended) 5 (to hold /usr) 6 (to hold /opt)\n# mkdir /mnt/root\n# mkdir /mnt/usr\n# mkdir /mnt/opt\n# mount /dev/sda1 /mnt/root\n# mount /dev/sda5 /mnt/usr\n# mount /dev/sda6 /mnt/opt\n.... copy data\n# cp -dpRxv /mnt/root/usr/* /mnt/usr\n# cp -dpRxv /mnt/root/opt/* /mnt/opt\n.... edit /mnt/root/etc/fstab\n.... i.e. add extra lines to mount /dev/sda5 on /usr and /dev/sda6 on /opt\n\nAt this point, you you be able to boot from /dev/sda and check everything works OK, but you will notice that we haven't deleted the old contents of /usr and /opt from /dev/sda1; we've just mounted the new directories over the old ones and hence hidden their contents. This is so if it doesn't work, you can just undo the edits from fstab (delete or comment out the extra lines you added) and you'll be back where you started without losing anything.\nFinally, when you've check it's OK, boot into the Live CD again, mount /dev/sda1 on /mnt and remove the old contents of /usr and /opt\n# rm -Rvf /mnt/usr/* /mnt/opt/*\n\nWhile I have restructured disks in the past, there is always the danger of mistyping a command and wiping out some data. In this case, since you never mount /dev/sda3 you should be OK, BUT I OFFER NO GUARANTEE AND YOU SHOULD CHECK CAREFULLY THAT YOU UNDERSTAND EACH STEP BEFORE TRYING ANYTHING!\n\nA: There's two ways of doing that which I'm aware of:\n\n\n*\n\n*The first would be to use an Ubuntu live CD or USB, boot your laptop from that and using GParted in the OS booted from that CD/USB unmount your /dev/sda3 partition so that you can resize it to take up the whole of your hard drive space.\n\n*The second would be to copy and paste all the data you need onto an external hard drive, then using an Ubuntu install such as a live CD/USB and reinstall Ubuntu 11.04 (or 11.10 or 12.04 if you feel like upgrading) and merge the partitions so you fill up the whole of your hard drive space. \nAs Ubuntu works quite well when it comes to partitioning both of these options are safe, however as always when modifying disk partitions it is always very recommened to back up beforehand that way even in the case even if something happens to go wrong, you're sure not to have lost any data. \nHope my answer was of some help, feel free to comment to ask me for more details if you're unsure of anything I've explained above as I might not have explained everything thoroughly enough. [Also I'm assuming when you said you wanted to create new partitions that you meant that you want to be able to use all the free disk space you have at the end of your hard drive, rather than create separate partitions for /usr and /opt as that would be quite a hassle to access afterwards]\n", "Q: Why is the GCC 4.7 PPA not upgrading to 4.7.1?

I have recently installed Ubuntu 12.04 in dual-boot with windows 7 but I am having some problems. I installed GRUB in the MBR (as it is often recommended) and so GRUB was the boot-loader that appeared at startup. But I wanted Windows boot-loader to appear at startup so I installed EasyBCD and added an entry of GRUB into the Windows boot-loader and then then did the 'Write MBR' and I got my desired results.\nToday, I installed Windows service pack updates and I was no longer able to boot into Ubuntu (maybe because the MRB was over-written by the update). Then I had to work my way out using GRUB rescue commands and then booting into Ubuntu and repairing boot (thanks to askUbuntu)\nSo here's my question, each time I update Windows there is a chance of loosing GRUB from the MBR and I'll have to do all those painful steps again to boot into Ubuntu. What's the solution of this problem?\nI did some research and found out this useful post to avoid the problem http://www.linuxbsdos.com/2012/05/17/how-to-dual-boot-ubuntu-12-04-and-windows-7/\nbut I am not sure If i should try this because installing GRUB in some partition other than the MBR is not recommended. (I once tried to do that in terminal but got an error message saying \"It's not a good idea what you're trying to do\")\nRegards\n\nA: This is more of a hardware solution than a software one, but it's still useful to consider:\n\n\n*\n\n*Install each OS to a separate hard drive\n\n*Set the BIOS to load the Ubuntu drive first\n\n*Use the bootloader to choose which OS to load for that session\n\n\nDoing so avoids a number of conflicts (as you have already encountered), and is reasonably future-proof.  The downside is additional hardware, and slightly more complex bootloader configuration.\n\nA: Dual booting Ubuntu and Windows 7 can be done:\n\n\n*\n\n*Using GRUB(2) or\n\n*Using Windows 7 boot manager\n\n\nWhen installing Ubuntu GRUB is installed by default to MBR and a dual-boot is created automatically to boot Ubuntu AND Windows 7. \nWhen installing Windows 7 NO dual boot is created automatically.\nFor users having more experience in Windows a dual-boot based on Windows boot manager should be the choice.\nWhy ?\nIf you have to run Windows 7 Repair for some reason it will overwrite MBR and put Windows code there ! You cannot change this as Microsoft does not care for any nonWindows OS installed !\nUsing Linux/Ubuntu repair you can fix Ubuntu/Linux/GRUB booting not destroying Windows 7 booting.\nOne stable method for creating Ubuntu 12 - Windows 7 dual boot is to use the boot sector file \"/boot/grub/boot.img\" from Ubuntu installation. This file is created during installation and contains boot code which \"knows\" how to load Ubuntu.\nboot.img + a Windows \"boot sector loader\" can and will boot Ubuntu under initial control of Windows 7 boot manager.\nSee Dual-boot Linux/Unix and Windows 7 for details how to create Windows \"boot sector loader\" and different ways of creating/copying \"boot sector file\".\nIf Windows 7 boot manager is in control of the booting and set to dual-boot Ubuntu you can do Windows updates and repairs and the dual-boot with Ubuntu will not be destroyed.\nA Windows/Linux/Ubuntu user should have some basic understanding of Windows 7 boot process and Ubuntu boot process when creating a dual-boot system as they use different booting algorithm and sooner or later you have to fix the dual-boot (when installing/updating newer versions of the OSs or for another reason).\n", "Q: How to manage available wireless network priority? I'd like to move up and down available wireless access points, setting priorities as we can do in Microsoft Windows. I can't remember to have ever succeeded in this since using network-manager. Maybe something with conf files is possible...\nI'm not interested in different network managers.\n\nA: Apparently in 2014 NetworkManager team introduced such a feature -- to specify priorities for different networks.  There is now connection.autoconnect-priority.\nThis article provides lots of information on how to interface NetworkManager via nmcli. \nFor example with\nnmcli -f NAME,UUID,AUTOCONNECT,AUTOCONNECT-PRIORITY c\n\nyou can list known networks and see their default priority to be 0. Now  I have run\nnmcli connection modify HOME-WIFI connection.autoconnect-priority 10\n\nto give my home WiFi higher priority. I have the same work WiFi points available at home as well, but need to connect to HOME-WIFI when I am home. That command heavily rewritten /etc/NetworkManager/system-connections/HOME-WIFI which added autoconnect-priority=10 into [connection] section - time will show if it works as it should.\n\nA: If you are using xfce, for instance under xubuntu 18.04, you can do this:\n\n\n*\n\n*Go to the Wifi applet (upper right corner)\n\n*Click \"Edit Connections\"\n\n*Double-click the network of interest\n\n*Click on the \"General\" tab\n\n*Enter a value for \"connection priority for auto-activation\"\n\n\nPositive numbers are higher priority; negative numbers are lower priority. The default priority seems to be 0, so I set the priority of the ubiquitous but not always working \"xfinitywifi\" to a negative number so that anything else connects first.\nConfession: I only found this after considerable effort toward adding the feature myself. Which goes to show that drag and drop would probably be worth adding simply because it is more intuitive to discover, although there would have to be a reckoning about how to reconcile it with the default sort order, etc. A \"priority\" tab in the connection list could be the right place to expose that feature.\n\nA: Can WiFi priority be dragged up and down in NetworkManager?\nThe short answer is “Not yet.” As of mid 2018, Ubuntu has nothing as easy as Microsoft Windows for setting the WiFi priority. However, there are ways to accomplish what you want.\n\nTL;DR? Summary\nFor command line use nmcli. For GUI, plasma-nm.\nnmcli -f autoconnect-priority,name c\nnmcli c mod \"mypreferred\" conn.autoconnect-p 10\nnmcli c mod \"xfinitywifi\" conn.autoconnect-p -10\n\nor\napt install plasma-nm\nkde5-nm-connection-editor\n\n\nAvailable alternatives\nHere are the currently available ways of setting WiFi priority, along with a short description of why they don't quite answer the original question.\nCommand line tools (nmcli)\nWhile this solution is probably the easiest way to do it and it does work with NetworkManager, nmcli does not allow Microsoft Windows-style drag-and-drop reordering. In fact, nmcli (as the name suggests) is a \"command line interface\" to NetworkManager, which means you'll need to type commands in the terminal, which can be off-putting for some people. I'll describe more how to use it below.\nPlasma-nm (kde5-nm-connection-editor)\nThis tool does not allow drag-and-drop reordering, but it does work with NetworkManager. Despite the name \"KDE\", it works with any desktop environment (I tested it with GNOME). It presents a graphical interface that lets one edit the \"autoconnect-priority\" of a network. I'll discuss how to use it below.\nWifi Radar\nThis tool does allow moving network priorities up and down, as requested. However, it is not actually integrated with Network Manager; in fact I believe it is a mistake to run both at the same time. Also, despite having a graphical interface, it is not as easy to use as it should be. Another reason to not use Wifi Radar is that it is a Python script that must be run as root, a potential security risk. Also, according to the man page, WiFi Radar is very power consuming and has \"probably lots\" of bugs. \nGNOME network control panel (not even in the running)\nI mention this more for completeness as it's what people would expect to work, but it doesn't. GNOME, which is Ubuntu's current default desktop environment, comes with a network control panel that simply cannot show or edit autoconnect priorities at all. (By the way, nmcli and plasma-nm both work fine under GNOME.)\nnm-connection-editor: GNOME's old network control panel\nGNOME used to have the ability to set connection priorities, albeit in a clunky way, not drag and drop. The old control panel is yet included in GNOME, but is not accessible by clicking. Instead, run the command nm-connection-editor, then select a WiFi network, click Edit, go to the General tab, and click the - / + buttons next to \"connection priority for auto activation\".\nEmacs/vi\nIf you're a hardcore geek, mumble code in your sleep, all you need to do is add the line \"autoconnect-priority: 10\" to the file /etc/NetworkManager/system-connections/foo. See nm-settings(5).\n\nFull explanation with examples\nBoth nmcli and kde5-nm-connection-editor can edit individual network autoconnect priorities. Only nmcli can show you a list of all the currently set priorities. Both assume that you know that higher numbers represent higher priorities and that zero is the default. Negative numbers are allowed and work to mark a network as a \"last resort\" if nothing else is available (See man nm-settings and search for \"autoconnect-priority\".)\nThe changes nmcli and plasma-nm make are stored permanently by NetworkManager in /etc/NetworkManager/system-connections/.\nHow to use nmcli\nThis is my preferred solution and it already comes with Ubuntu. If you're familiar with the command line or if you have a naturally linguistic brain, you may find this solution easier than using a mouse. On the other hand, if you want to try a graphical interface first, skip ahead to the next section on KDE's plasma-nm. For all of the examples below, you'll need to open a Terminal to type in the commands. \nTo list current priorities\n$ nmcli -f autoconnect-priority,name c \n\nSample output:\nAUTOCONNECT-PRIORITY  NAME\n0                     Blake5Net             \n0                     Caffe Ubuntu      \n0                     Caffe Ubuntu Guest      \n0                     Fire Hotspot          \n0                     JET & Mishka             \n0                     La Marzocco           \n0                     Le_MX                 \n0                     MobileLab             \n0                     xfinitywifi           \n\nTip: If you have a very long list, you may want to sort them by priority:\nnmcli -f autoconnect-priority,name c | tail -n +2 | sort -nr\n\nHow to set a network as preferred\nnmcli connection modify \"Caffe Ubuntu\" connection.autoconnect-priority 10\n\nNote that you can use any number you want for the priority. A larger number moves the network to the top of the list. \nHow to set a network as a last resort\nnmcli connection modify \"xfinitywifi\" connection.autoconnect-priority -10\n\nNegative priority values are lower than the default of 0, which means they will be tried last, if no other known WiFi network can be found. Note that, due to a bug in some versions of nmcli, you may see negative numbers listed as huge positive numbers like 4294967286. Don't worry about this as it will still work fine. \nHow to use plasma-nm\nPlasma-nm, KDE's NetworkManager client, lets you change a network's priority through several clicks in a graphical interface. You cannot drag-and-drop, instead you must specify a number. As with nmcli, higher numbers are higher priority. Unfortunately, you cannot see a list of what other priorities you've set in the past so you may have to guess at a number. Personally, I just use \"10\" for preferred networks and \"-10\" for last resort networks and I don't differentiate between them beyond that.\nYou don't need to install all of KDE just to get plasma-nm. (On my machine, running GNOME, the full KDE package would have required downloading over 600MB; in contrast, plasma-nm was only 8MB). I installed plasma-nm from the command line like so:\nsudo apt install plasma-nm\n\nand I ran it by typing this:\nkde5-nm-connection-editor\n\n(Well, technically, I didn't type all that. I used TAB to autocomplete the typing for me).\nIf you don't use KDE, the first time you run plasma-nm, it will ask you about creating a \"wallet\" to store credentials. I just hit \"Cancel\" to the question and it worked fine for me.\nThen it will show you a list of connections. Double-click on the connection you want to edit. That will bring up the \"Connection Editor\" panel. Choose the \"General Configuration\" tab. At the bottom, you'll see a box labeled \"Priority\". Change it from 0 to 10 (preferred) or -10 (last resort). Click \"OK\" to save the changes.\n\nSince changes are permanently stored with NetworkManager, once you're finished adjusting priorities, you don't have to keep plasma-nm installed if you don't want to. (sudo apt remove plasma-nm)\n\nA: \nWiFi Radar is a Python/PyGTK2 utility for managing WiFi profiles.  It\n  enables you to scan for available networks and create profiles for\n  your preferred networks. At boot time, running WiFi Radar will\n  automatically scan for an available preferred network and connect to\n  it. You can drag and drop your preferred networks to arrange the\n  profile priority. 1\n\nInstall WiFi Radar, just press Ctrl+Alt+T on your keyboard to open Terminal.

To use the old one, which exposes more options, run nm-connection-editor.\n\n\nA: I carry around a mobile Wifi device (4G) and also use the mobile hotspot from my mobile (4G but different provider). When I'm at home or work I usually use the Wifi available there. But when things are slow I sometimes need to switch wifi to the mobile devices. Here's what I did to make it faster.\nSet the priorities\n\n\n*\n\n*I ran nm-connection-editor from the terminal. That opens the 'Network Connections' application where you can set the priorities for the different Wifi access point you use.\n\n\n\n\n\n*I changed the priorities so that the mobile Wifi devices are higher up in the order.\n\n\n*\n\n*Mobile hotspot -> 100\n\n*Mobile Wifi device -> 90\n\n*Office Wifi -> 50\n\n*Home Wifi -> 40 , etc\n\n\n*Now when I'm in office it's usually connected to Office Wifi, if it doesn't detected the mobile ones at startup. However in case I feel the Office network is slow and wish to connect to a mobile wifi, I simply run a shortcut (Ctrl+Alt+R) key with the below command: \nsh -c \"nmcli r wifi off && nmcli r wifi on\"\nCreate a shortcut key\n\n\n*\n\n*Open Settings > Devices > Keyboard Shortcuts\n\n*Scroll down and click the plus (+) button at the bottom to add a new shortcut\n\n*Give it a name, key combination (Ctrl+Alt+R in my case) and enter the below code in the Command field:\nsh -c \"nmcli r wifi off && nmcli r wifi on\"\nThis is a combination of two commands - first part turns off the wifi and the second part turns it back on. When it does this it connects you to the Wifi access point with the highest priority available.\n\n\n\n*Save and you're done. \n\n\nNow whenever you want to connect to a Wifi access point with a higher priority simply use the keyboard shortcut.

I would like to stop Ubuntu from mounting my other (Windows) partitions automatically since I do not need it very often, I would like not to automount \"System reserved\" partition for Windows. \nThere is a similar question here: \nHow can I stop Ubuntu 12.04 from mounting Fedora 16's Swap Partition?\nHowever, I do not have these partitions added in /etc/fstab.\nHow can I do it ? \nFor proof, my /etc/fstab:\nproc            /proc           proc    nodev,noexec,nosuid          0   0\n# / was on /dev/sda7 during installation\nUUID=1384cee0-6a71-4b83-b0d3-1338db925168 / ext4  errors=remount-ro  0   1\n# swap was on /dev/sda6 during installation\nUUID=e3729117-b936-4c1d-9883-aee73dab6729 none swap    sw            0   0\n#------ MY WINDOWS D DRIVE---------- I WANT TO KEEP IT\nUUID=98E8B14DE8B12A80   /media/d ntfs   defaults,errors=remount-ro   0   0\n\n\nA: The solution is to add them to /etc/fstab, but with options to prevent them from being automatically mounted.  The option you want is noauto rather than auto.  For example, to prevent a windows partition from being mounted, you could add an entry like the following:\nUUID=C2A281E4A281DCF3  /media    ntfs-3g    defaults,noauto    0    0\nYou can run blkid to retrieve the partition UUID:\nsudo blkid\nSee \"Using UUID\" in the Ubuntu Docs.\nOr, to make it more self-documenting and simpler, although not quite as fail-proof, I have switched to using disk labels rather than UUIDs.  You just need to make sure the label is descriptive and unique; unlike using UUIDs, labels are not guaranteed to be unique, but I've never run into a problem, and it's more convenient, as you can swap a different partition by using the same label, and no need to modify /etc/fstab, or to run blkid.  \nContrast the above entry with this one:\nLABEL=Win_sys   /media     ntfs-3g   defaults,noauto   0  0\n\nA good explanation of fstab options can be found on the ArchWiki and on the Ubuntu Docs.\n\nA: Just use gnome-disks facility in Ubuntu.

I would like to try using Cheese in Google+ Hangouts, and similar configurations, and I would like to know if it is possible for the webcam to be used by two processes to have access to the webcam at the same time. I have not tried it as yet, but before I do, I figured I would ask.\nSo, is it possible?\n\nA: Well I just tried. Interesting results.\nI have got skype and cheese and webcam toy and hangouts (which all do work) and tried them together.\nResults:\nYou can't use the same webcam on 2 things at once.\nCheese (Working) + Webcam Toy (Not working) + Skype (Small, top right. Not working).\n\nYou can use 2 webcams on 2 things though. (Cheese + Webcam Toy).\n\nHangouts (Not working) + Cheese (Working)\n\nHangouts (Working on it's own).\n\nCheese broken when I opened Hangouts first. It did the same with the others, but my internet is too slow to upload every single screenshot (and I doubt you'd appreciate 30+ screenshots)...\n\nI even tried making a symbolic link to /dev/video0 and saving it in /dev as video2. That didn't work.\nI also can't run 2 cheese processes at once.\nIf you had to, I would advise making it full screen and doing 2 screen recordings.

(Check the link and scroll down to view the README for instructions.)\nYou can install v4l2loopback by cloning its GitHub and running these commands:\n$ git clone https://github.com/umlaeute/v4l2loopback.git\n$ cd v4l2loopback\n$ make\n$ sudo make install\n\nExamples\nFor samples on how to use it with GStreamer, FFmpeg, MPlayer, and Skype, check their small wiki. Hopefully you could find the right settings to fit your needs.\nEnjoy tweaking around!\n\nA: The answer is no with a maybe... The Library, \"Video 4 Linux\" detects whether a device is being used, and will not initiate. However; if you wish to download libv4l-dev and edit it manually, you can edit the code to get rid of this check and then just recompile it. I imagine you could get this to work, but it would be extremely unstable. May be worth checking out though.\nTLDR: Anything is possible if you are a programmer with some elbow grease handy. Don't want to go that far? Then no; its not possible.\n\nA: I has success using OBS Open Broadcast Software after the following steps:\n\n\n*\n\n*Install video4linux loopback device (v4l2loopback as suggested by others)\n(I am on Ubuntu 18.04 and had to install a newer version as suggested here: https://github.com/CatxFish/obs-v4l2sink/issues/30)\n\n*Install OBS\n(Again I had to install a newer version and ffmpeg as per these instructions: https://itsubuntu.com/install-obs-in-linux-operating-system/)\n\n*Install OBS-v4lsink\n(go to https://github.com/CatxFish/obs-v4l2sink, then to \"releases\", download and install de .deb file, version 0.1.0 was the only deb file there)\n\n*Start v4l2loopback:\nsudo modprobe v4l2loopback\n\n\n*In OBS and select a source\nUnder \"sources\" click on \"+\", give your new layer a name, select your (real) webcam\n\n*In OBS select a sink\nIn the top menu go to tools > v42lsink, select the virtual webcam (/dev/videoX, with X being the highest number available), click start\n\n*In your applications select the virtual webcam\nI had Zoom and Discord both using the same new virtual webcam and was also able to record from the camera using OBS\n\nA: Since there is no answer using ffmpeg, this is it.\n\nExplanation\nWhile v4l2loopback creates virtual video devices, they are not associated with anything by default. To make them useful, you have to send streams to them via external applications such as ffmpeg.\nFirst load the module\n$ sudo modprobe v4l2loopback exclusive_caps=1 video_nr=5 #creates `/dev/video5`\n\nand then send your webcam's input to the virtual device.\n$ ffmpeg -i /dev/video0 -f v4l2 -codec:v rawvideo -pix_fmt yuv420p /dev/video5\n\nNow /dev/video5 works as a pseudo-webcam. Note, unlike a physical webcam, a single virtual video device can be accessed from multiple applications simultaneously. Thus, in this case, you don't have to create many virtual devices.\nI wrote a script to wrap these steps: v4l2_webcam - GitHub.\n\nApplication\nYou can send any (raw) video to a virtual video device. This means, for example, it is possible to use a complicatedly mixed video by OBS as a camera input to a Web meeting (e.g. Skype, Zoom, etc.).\nHere is a relatively complex but very practical example:\nStructure\n\nResult\n\n", "Q: When I run sudo lshw in terminal, it asks for my administrator password, but it won't accept keyboard input when I try to type? \nPossible Duplicate:\nNothing shows up on the screen when I type my password \n\nI have been trying to run [sudo lshw] but it asks [password for grace: [] ]\nSo when I try to type my password, it doesn't even come up with any letters, asterisks not does the [] move.

I made this setup using the alternate cd and set the amount of disk space to be used to 100GB, presuming that the remainder would become available as regular, unencrypted disk space.\nIt turns out that the 400 GB of free disk space is actually encapsulated in the LVM2 container, as Disk Utility shows me. How do I shrink the LVM2 container so I can utilize this 400 GB?\n\nA: Simple answer - you can't. (But you may want to do something else to get what you want - see below)\nLVM2 has 3 'levels', the Physical Volumes (which is what I assume you are referring to as an LVM2 container), Volume Groups and Logical Volumes.\nGenerally you define one or more partitions to be Physical Volumes for LVM2. Once this is done, the partition cannot be used for anything else (in the same way a partition can only be used for one filesystem).\nE.g.:\n# pvcreate /dev/sdb3\n\nYou then create a new Volume Group or add the physical volume to an existing group\n# vgcreate MyVolGroup /dev/sdb3\n\nor\n# vgextend MyVolGroup /dev/sdb3\n\nYou then create the Logical Volume, which actually gets used for a filesystem.\n# lvcreate -L100G --name MyVolume MyVolGroup\n\nThe Logical Volumes can be resized without losing data, although it's non-trival. But the Physical Volumes' sizes are fixed as the partition sizes.\nIf you actually want to use your 400Gb of space which is already allocated to a Physical Volume (LVM2 container) then the answer is to create another Logical Volume and use that.\nTo find then name of the Volume Group (if you don't already know it) use the vgs command.\n# lvcreate -L400G --name MySpace VolGroup\n# mkfs -text4 /dev/VolGroup/MySpace\n# mount /dev/VolGroup/MySpace /mnt\n\nThe more advanced alternative, if you have enough spare space to create a new partition, is to force the existing Logical Volume to be moved (using pvmove) so that you can free up the 500Gb Physical Volume (vgreduce and pvremove commands) and then create a smaller container and move the data back again, but there's probably little advantage over simply using Logical Volumes for everything.\n\nA: You didn't specify why you want to shrink the LVM partition, so it is possible that you may just want to create new logical volumes within the LVM container.  If you are sure that you really want to reduce the size of the LVM container, then you can use pvresize to reduce the size of the Physical Volume, and then partitioning tools such as fdisk or parted to reduce the size of the disk partition that contains the physical volume.  You need to make sure that you are using units of sectors when partitioning ( in parted, the unit s command will do this  ).  You will need to delete the partition, then recreate it with the same starting sector, but a smaller size.  If you specify the size to pvresize in GB, you will need to convert to sectors by multiplying by 1024 * 1024 * 2, and should round up for safety, i.e. add an extra GB.  You will need to reboot for the changes to the partition table to take effect, and then you may want to use pvresize again without a size argument to expand it back up to the maximum size the new partition holds.  You will then have unpartitioned space to do with as you wish.\n", "Q: Recognising an internal Logitech camera I have an Acer Aspire from 2007, it had vista and now has 12.4.

It appears to me a screen shows the following thing :\nVideo card : NVIDIA GeForce 410M not supported \nand when I click yes to continue, a black page appears and nothing works.\nThanks.\n\nA: Your graphics card is not capable enough for the game. I doubt that using a low graphics setting would help (if it even exists), and if it could, I don't know whether it would be possible to change the configuration file or not.\nAnd don't feel bad about your graphics card, mine isn't capable enough either ;). If you really want to play the game, try getting a better one (Radeon HD 6950-6970 seems like a good option, since it is around $200-400, and is very powerful)\n", "Q: User folder on Windows EMPTY After I installed PlayOnLinux, I wanted to install a Windows program that is located in my Windows User folder that is on different partition. But it was 'empty' before I knew it! I don't know if it's really gone or just hidden. I've tried Show Hidden Files and writing the location manually but still failed. \nPlease let me know what I can do to fix this.\n\nA: The Windows folder on PlayOnLinux and Wine do not store your Windows files and/or programs. The Windows folder is used to create a space where all the files needed to run a windows program is located, excluding Windows boot mechanisms and YOUR Windows. It's not the Windows located on your hard disk, it's just a dummy folder and will not hold any of your data at all.\nThe thing you need to do instead of this is to copy the installed files from Windows to a thumb drive, external drive, CD or whatever or load the disc of the game, or get the installation package from wherever and follow the instructions here.\nI highly recommend Wine as an alternative, because PlayOnLinux is actually based off Wine and personally I find Wine so much easier to use and there are many more support pages and documentations to read and discover.\nThe only advice I can offer to you now is read the documentation! That should've told you everything I just wrote, and use YouTube and Google - because they are great sources.\n", "Q: How do I get rid of this module-combine error in Pulse Audio I've been having problems with my Pulse Audio server, and recently while investigating, I came across these error messages in /var/log/syslog:\nJul 20 09:16:40 mythbuntu pulseaudio[6555]: [pulseaudio] module.c: module-combine is deprecated: Please use module-combine-sink instead of module-combine!\nJul 20 09:16:40 mythbuntu pulseaudio[6555]: [pulseaudio] module-combine.c: We will now load module-combine-sink. Please make sure to remove module-combine from your configuration.\n\nI looked in /etc/pulse/default.pa for any mention of module-combine, but did not see any. Also, I searched the web for elements of the error message and only got links to bug reports with vague discussions.\nHow do I get rid of this module-combine error?\n\nA: The issue is in the 'paprefs' package, which on the 'Simultaneous Output' tab controls loading the 'module-combine' module.  It has not been updated to use the 'module-combine-sink', and the 'module-combine' is now a dummy module that simply warns and then loads the 'module-combine-sink'.\nYou can change the module loaded by the paprefs setting by using 'gconf-editor' and changing 'system/pulseaudio/modules/combine', the 'name0' key should have 'module-combine-sink' value instead of just 'module-combine'.\nIn theory there are two bugs:\n\n\n*\n\n*'paprefs' shouldn't be using 'module-combine'\n\n*'paprefs' should migrate to 'dconf'\n\n\nHope that helps.\n\nA: From the pulseaudio warning we can see that some script or application tries to load the deprecated module-combine. This however will not do any harm to your pulseaudio setup as pulseaudio has a fallback mechanism to load the module-combine-sink instead. Of course this will not be done without a warning in the logfiles.\nIf you really want to get rid of this message you will have to investigate places where this module may be loaded. One possibility is your /etc/pulse/default.pa which could also be located in ~/.pulse/default.pa. Another possibility is /etc/pulse/system.pa in case we run pulseaudio system-wide, or an older version of paprefs.\nHowever any application may load a pulseaudio module at runtime. We have no experience on Mythubuntu, and have no idea which applications you may have installed. It may be therefore be worth to check what application have just started when the warning message appears, and see if any of those have a configuration file where we need to replace the module-combine by module-combine-sink.\n", "Q: Can I run Ubuntu, Xubuntu and Kubuntu in the same computer? I was wondering if I could run those three versions in the same computer and how. I would love having them in my computer.\n\nA: Yes.\nFirst:\nRun sudo apt-get update in terminal (just in case, What is a terminal and how do I open and use it?) to get an up to date package list.\nFor Xubuntu sudo apt-get install xubuntu-desktop or  xubuntu-desktop \nFor Kubuntu sudo apt-get install kubuntu-desktop or kubuntu-desktop \n\nBe prepared to fix some things like the splash screen, How to recover splash screen\n\nOtherwise you can use them with your same user on the log-in screen by selecting the icon near your name to get a list of desktops.\nHow do I switch to Xubuntu?\n\nA: Perhaps you could refine your question? Are you asking if you can run three separate installs of ubuntu, xubuntu, and kubuntu on the same hard-drive with different partitions? Or are you asking if you can you can use the Desktop Environments for each in the same partition?\nIf you are asking if you can install Ubuntu, Xubuntu, and Kubuntu as separate partitions then the answer is yes. If you are asking if you can use the three desktop environments as well as the packages that come with each, then the answer is also yes.\nI am sure that you can install each separately on the same hard-drive as different partitions, and choose which one you want from the grub loader. However, you would have to install three times! \n\nA: Here's a nested list of your various options:\n\n\n*\n\n*You can install multiple desktop environments in the same Ubuntu system, by installing the corresponding package. Most of these are metapackages.\n\n\n*\n\n*GNOME 3 with Unity / Unity 2D: ubuntu-desktop\n\n*GNOME 3 with GNOME Shell: gnome-shell\n\n*GNOME 3 with GNOME Fallback (looks like, but isn't, GNOME 2): gnome-session-fallback\n\n*KDE 4 Plasma Workspaces - kubuntu-desktop\n\n*Xfce 4 - xubuntu-desktop\n\n*LXDE - lubuntu-desktop\nThat's not an exhaustive list of metapackages providing desktop environments. Other variants, like edubuntu-desktop, can also be installed this way.\nThe best way to have an Ubuntu system with GNOME Unity, KDE 4, and Xfce 4 installed is probably to install the Ubuntu desktop CD, then add the kubuntu-desktop and xubuntu-desktop packages.\nIf you're installing from the command-line with sudo apt-get install ..., make sure to run sudo apt-get update first to update information about what versions are available of software to install. Otherwise, and especially given that these are big metapackages:\n\n\n*\n\n*It may try to install some versions that are no longer available, causing the installation to fail.\n\n*It may try to install some versions that are buggy and don't work right with each other.\n\n*You may incur security vulnerabilities (though you could fix them by a subsequent upgrade of everything to the latest version).\n\n*It takes much more time and effort to upgrade potentially hundreds of packages after installing old versions, than to run sudo apt-get update first and install the newest recommended versions in the first place.\n\n\nRemember, when you install these big metapackages, many packages are installed.\nOf course, you can install them just as well through the Software Center (no sudo apt-get update needed, it's taken care of automatically).\nIf you have more than one desktop environment installed, you can work in one system where you have access to everything. This is quite valuable, so this is probably what you'll want to do. However, note that, unless you do quite a bit of manual reconfiguration, you'll see all applications when in each desktop environment (in its menus, or when you search for installed apps), including applications designed for the other desktop environments.\nThey will still run, and most of them without any problems at all, since even those applications that are very strongly pinned to a particular DE have that DE installed in this scenario. When running, though, they may cause significant background user services associated with their desktop environment to start up in the background. This sort of thing is particularly common when running KDE programs in GNOME.\n\n*You can install Ubuntu and its derivatives (Kubuntu and Xubuntu) separately, on separate partitions. There's another major choice to make, within this:\n\n\n*\n\n*You can have a separate /home partition which they all share. Your per-user settings and other user-specific files like browser bookmarks, cookies, and cache if you use the same browser application will be shared. This is very convenient.\nBut with multiple versions of some software using the same settings and data (since some programs are shared between GNOME/Unity, KDE, and XFCE), you may experience some problems. For example, if one system is updated before another, older versions of software may be unable to access configuration data \"upgraded\" by the newer versions. Yu may also want to customize your personal menus differently in ways not facilitated easily when the different systems share /home.\n\n*Each system has a separate /home. You have separate Documents, Downloads, and Desktop folders (for example) and each application is configured separately for you in the separate systems.\nA secondary choice to make is whether or not to use separate swap partitions.\n\n\n*\n\n*You should probably share the swap partition. The systems aren't both swapping to it at the same time, after all.\n\n*But if you use it for hibernation (i.e., suspend to disk) and you want to be able to run one system while hibernating another, you should have separate swap partitions. Even if you don't want to do this, if you plan to use hibernation at all, you might want separate swap partitions in case you make a mistake, so you don't overwrite one system's hibernation state by booting the other system by accident.\n\nA: You could in two ways. You can add plasma and xfce4 desktops to a current gnome ubuntu desktop but this come with a lot of bloat (just like if you added Cinnamon or Gnome-Shell to a unity install). You could also make a logical drive with separate root partitions for each DE and a /home folder for them to share but each desktop would require a different login/username to ensure there is no desktop settings problems.\n", "Q: Psychonauts for Ubuntu 12.04 won't start I'm having problems starting Psychonauts, from the latest Humble Indie Bundle.

Didn't work. \nI've found some similar questions to this on askubuntu, but those solutions didn't seem to work either. Please help?\n\nA: Two things you can try. These may not work on Nvidia, it works on Intel chips, even if it doesn't work it will not harm anything.\nFirst see if you have the needed libraries for texture compression needed for mesa, the easiest way is to open the Software Center and search for;\nlibtxc-dxtn-s2tc0\n\nIf you have Psychonauts installed on a 64bit system it also needs the i386 version of these libs (note if you installed Psychonauts with the Software Center the i386 version should have been installed but check to make sure).\nlibtxc-dxtn-s2tc0:i386\n\nIf you don't have either version of the above libs, install them and try to launch again.(Note: if you can run Amnesia from the bundle it is likely that the 64bit libs are installed already)  If you have them or if after install the launch still fails: \nYou can try to force the system to advertise  S3TC support(this was needed for Intel Chips without the i386 version of the libs installed) by launching via the terminal with:\nforce_s3tc_enable=true  <path to application launcher>\n\nForcing the S3TC can cause misbehavior so you will have to try it and see if it will work.  If the above command does work you can edit the .desktop file to launch the game with the force enabled by using gedit\nsudo gedit /usr/share/applications/psychonauts.desktop\n\nEdit the Exec=line and add force_s3tc_enable=true <plus a space> in front of the launch path  it should read something like force_s3tc_enable=true /opt/psychonauts/psychonauts.64bin Note the space between the true and the/opt, further note that this is only an example. I no longer have psychonauts installed as my graphic card was not strong enough to handle it(but I did get it working with the force command) so the actual laucher could not have the .bin64 at the very end, but you should know exactaly what the path is and you only need to paste the force_s3tc_enable=true in front of the path in the Exec= command, just make sure to add the [space] before the path\nI used RAOF's answer as my source for the commands, I only tried to make it specific to you question, so if this works please make sure to upvote his answer to give him some credit for the original info.\nAs I noted above I no longer have Psychonauts installed so I can no longer compare the errors that you are getting to the ones that I was.\n{EDIT} I have tried installing via the Software Center.  I was able to get it to launch without any problems as the .deb file for the i386 version of the libs were downloaded as a dependency.  I have edited my answer above to reflect this as well.  My graphics chip was still not strong enough to handle the game but I was getting much better performance than when I had to force S3TC performance. With both the 64 & 32 bit libs installed the \"force\" part of my answer my be unneeded but I will leave it in place in case it is needed by somebody.{EDIT}\n\nA: I just experienced the same issue. The Psychonauts desktop shortcut is set to launch psychonauts.sh by default. It seems the Bash file is trying to do some clever workaround mostly for Intel graphics cards (incl. integrated graphics). Unfortunately this interferes with the NVidia drivers and causes a segmentation fault. In my case I was able to run the game by using /opt/psychonauts/Psychonauts directly (note capital P and no .sh). I am also running Bumblebee so in my case the full command is:\n$ optirun /opt/psychonauts/Psychonauts\n\nIf this doesn't work for you, try updating the LD_LIBRARY_PATH environment variable so it points to the NVidia driver's files like so:\n$ LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/usr/lib32/nvidia-current [optirun] /opt/psychonauts/Psychonauts\n\noptirun is optional and you should include it only if running on an Optimus configuration with a discrete video card.\n\nIf you wish to learn more about the variables included in the Bash file, here are a couple of articles of interest:\n\n\n*\n\n*Is there an easy way to enable S3TC on Intel graphics?\n\n*32 bit GL on amd64 is broken on oneiric with nvidia-graphics-drivers\n", "Q: Installing Xubuntu on a 4 GB storage device (Eee PC 701) Now that Xubuntu needs 4.3 GB of storage to install, I can't install it on my 4GB Eee PC any more.

There is no way to install Windows within Ubuntu other than running Windows in a virtual machine.\nIn case you choose to not install Windows in a virtual machine I would recommend you backup your Ubuntu, repartition your drive for a separate Ubuntu, and a Windows partition, and do a fresh install of both operating systems as dual boot.\n", "Q: Kubuntu 12.04 VMware Workstation - No Window After Patch I installed VMware Workstation 7.1.5 on Kuuntu 12.04 (3.2.0-26).

I have also tried Scientific Linux. No success. \nWhen I installed Windows 7 .. had no problems.\nAny ideas?\n\nA: Excuse my english, please. I got same problem installing ubuntu 12.04 in my laptop. I noted the problem have to be something  relationed with the wifi hardware because the driver is not implemented in the kernel, I guess. I solved it turning off the wifi (or unplugging it), and getting a normal installation, installing the wifi driver after that. Maybe your problem with another part of your hardware.\n\nA: It shouldn't be an UEFI problem since the Live CD already booted. However, this motherboard uses the typical Asus UEFI, which allows you to boot Live CDs in both UEFI and BIOS mode via the F8/F12 boot menu, given that you use UEFI capable Live CDs like 11.10 amd64 and onward.

Every forth release Ubuntu sets a version as LTS, meaning \"Long term support\". They generally focus more on stability for these, and less on new features.\nThe reason they have this is so companies that rely on Ubuntu can know they will be supported for a long time without having to upgrade every six months.\nUbuntu makes it easy to upgrade directly from LTS to LTS for this reason.\nThe latest LTS is 12.04, this one.\n", "Q: Ubuntu 12.04 stereo duplex sound problem Ubuntu 12.04; linux-kernel 3.2.0-27; alsa driver ver. 1.0.24\ni have some problem with my HDA Intel ALC662 rev1.

Besides in pulseaudio-control panel in hardware properties my device set to analog stereo duplex, and i can't set it to analog stereo output beacouse it's always set back to stereo duplex.\n\nA: Setting the soundcard profile was limited in gnome-control-center for a simpler user experience (see bug #972554). This also affects the switching to Analog stereo from Analog duplex stereo. We can still do this with pavucontrol . This may also improve the noise you are experiencing when no device is plugged in the input jack.\nFrom the log files attached to bug #1027570 we can see that we try to switch to the microphone port but fail. We may disable the automatic switching by commenting out the following line in /etc/pulse/default.pa to look like this:\n# load-module module-switch-on-port-available\n\nThis requires editing this file as root (e.g. by running gksu gedit /etc/pulse/default.pa).

Some recent update has caused my Thunderbird (14.0 on Ubuntu 12.04) to revert to an English-language user interface. It used to be German before. \nMy system is completely in German. German language support is fully installed in System Settings. thunderbird-locale-de is installed as well. I even tried to remove and reinstall this package, without any visible change.\nI also tried resetting general.useragent.locale to de-DE via Thunderbird's own configuration editor. No change as well.\nHow do I get my German interface back?\n\nA: The solution was actually very simple: The update had disabled the German locale extension within Thunderbird. So thunderbird-locale-de was present, but not enabled.\nIf you run into a similar issue, be sure to check Tools > Addons > Languages and click \"Enable\" on your language extension if necessary. After a restart, everything works fine.\n\nA: German only is simple, as above.  A greater difficulty is how to avoid the standard US version in favour of the UK version [the US guys want to force everybody to use their version].\nI have a similar problem: residing in China, but speaking UK English. The main problem is the repositories: if the standard Ubuntu repositories are used, then only the US version can be installed. This means all emails are composed with USA spelling, not the desired UK spellings. [One would think a simple change in the config file is required to point to the language pack. But no, I could not find anything anywhere to customise TB to default to UK language and spelling.] My \"solution\" was to hack the install.\nBefore proceeding, readers should install \"Synaptic\" and be familiar with its menus and functions.\n1/ get the latest release for the language you want.\n1a/ Go to the Mozilla web page and download the language you want [UK in my case] from https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/thunderbird/all/ \n1b/ unpack the bz2 file to anywhere you want on your hardrive, example: \\home\\Tbird. [this results in many files and subdirectories]\n2/ add the Mozilla ppa to Synaptic and update.\n2a/ http://ppa.launchpad.net/ubuntu-mozilla-security/ppa/ubuntu\n2b/ click Synaptic menu button \"mark upgrades\", then click \"apply\". Ths installs the latest TB release with all dependencies. [this ensures you get all the libs you need]\n2c/ note: this results in a US version. the UK version is per step 3.\n2d/ ensure TB is working after the above steps. [I had no troubles]\n3/ find the installed TB files and overwrite them.\n3a/ Ubuntu 16.10 installs the TB files in \\usr\\lib\\thunderbird. [Ensure this applies to you]\n3b/ copy all files/directories from \\home\\Tbird to \\usr\\lib\\thunderbird and replace all files/directories.\n3c/ you should have now the TB version you want [UK in my case].\n4/ in Synaptic, uncheck the Mozilla ppa you added in step 1.\nWhy this works?

So far I've been successful to do it using xmodmap for a variety of keys. However, no matter what I do, I can't get the Alt_R (the right side Alt key) which has a key code of 108 to map to the Up key. Here's the command I'm using:\nxmodmap -e \"keycode 108 = Up\"\n\nIs there anything more that I need to do to get this working. Even after these changes, whenever I hit the Alt_R key, it ends up minimizing the current window.\nI'm on Ubuntu 11.04\n\nA: using xmodmap like you did above worked for me. My assumption is that Alt_R may be assigned to the function of minimizing windows somewhere and that the system doesn't forward the keypress to the Terminal after this. Have you checked the system shortcuts or maybe in compiz? Not sure if there is a compiz-module to minimze windows via a shortcut though.\n", "Q: Mic is not workin in my desktop available: unknown I am using ubuntu 12.04 Desktop. Mic is not working.

I already published my proprietary app on Ubuntu Software Centre (https://myapps.developer.ubuntu.com), and now I want to update it with the new version.\nThis time I wanted to upload multiple builds for a single app (one for Ubuntu 12.04 i386, one for Ubuntu 12.04. amd64, one for Ubuntu 11.10 i386, ...)\nThe problem is that it doesn't seem possible. New upload overwrites the old one.\nIs it correct that the Software Centre only supports a single binary package per application ?\nI could try creating the new app per build, but that seems like a wrong solution.\nAny tips to solve the problem ?\n\nA: MyApps isn't setup to handle the situation of separate binaries per arch/series.\nI'd suggest just ensuring that all your binaries get to the reviewer and they'll handle uploading the correct binaries to the PPA for you (until myapps is updated to handle this situation).\n\n\n*\n\n*Option 1: If your binaries are small, gzip them together to a single file and use the package upload field\n\n*Option 2: If they're large, it'll be easier to upload them somewhere else (Ubuntu1 or dropbox) and share them via a url, noting that in your myapps submission.\n\n*Option 3: (I need to check if this'd be OK, policy-wise) If your binaries will build fine on Launchpad's build service, create a PPA, find me on IRC (noodles775 on freenode) and we can privatise your PPA, then you can dput your source and have them built by LP for the distroseries/arches automatically.\n\n\nA: It looks to me like the myapps site is designed to cater mainly for Python/GTK applications - cross platform apps of only the latest version.  For these reasons there is no facility to allow selections based on CPU and version, although obviously that facility does exist for Software Centre and automatic updates using the repositories.\nI think that myapps is the wrong tool for the job if you want to publish compiled versions (binaries) of your program for different releases and CPUs.  You might need to look at setting up a project on Launchpad and going mainstream with the development.\nhttps://launchpad.net/projects/+new\nAlternately, I believe the PPAs should be able to be set up to do what you want with regards to 32 and 64 bit versions, however it's not the same as publishing with myapps because they would not be accessible until someone adds the PPA to their sources.\n\nA: \nMichael Nelson's answer should be considered, ahem, \"canonical\", but since I had a draft almost done, here's my two cents :)\n\nI think the Dev Portal's policy on how to upload proprietary packages pretty much explains why you have this problem and what your alternatives are:\n\nLet's break it down:\n\n\n*\n\n*Sources or binaries\n\n\n*\n\n*It appears you want to upload multiple binaries. Generally, proprietary binary apps are either statically linked, or bundle their necessary dependencies with relative paths, so that nothing extra needs to be installed via apt-get, except perhaps ia32-libs.\n\n*It would be up to you to make sure that such a binary runs on Ubuntu 11.04/11.10/12.04 (whichever you're targeting), without failing on any platform; AFAIK the core requirement is that the libc used to compile your app/libraries be backwards-compatible with the oldest-possible kernel you wish to target; I believe anything that is Lucid or newer is fine with the current libc 2.15 on Precise.\n\n*I don't know how extensive Canonical's packaging services to commercial devs are if you submit a non-debianized source, but I assume it would have to be compile-able to something similar to the above \"universal\" binary.\n\n\n*Debian Source Package:\n\n\n*\n\n*If you go with this option, all you need to do is (a) ensure that any dependencies are available in the repos for the oldest release you want to target, and that (b) your app does not use any new-fangled functions/API/ABI in those dependencies such that it works on say, 12.04 but fails on 11.04.\n\n*In this case, I believe Canonical/Soyuz (the build system) will take care of creating multiple packages for each release.\n\n\n*Get a human involved - pack all your different binaries into a giant tarball and contact noodles775 ;p\n\nA: Use Launchpad's PPA system - makes an easy Ubuntu repository. Go to launchpad.net. If you sign up, you should be able to add different builds for the same package.\n\nA: just update with update manager and it will be done\n\nA: Use either Synaptic or aptitude instead of the Ubuntu Software Centre. This way, you will have more control over exactly which packages are going to be installed and you will be able to check the dependencies, recommends packages, etc. before the packages are installed.\n", "Q: HUD in other window managers (especially xmonad) It seems that HUD (Heads Up Display) is tightly tied to Unity. However I just use xmonad as a window manager, especially I don't use unity. \nIs there a way to use HUD within xmonad (or more generally withing other window managers and desktop environments)? If so, what are the detailed steps to do it with minimal dependencies on unity?\nAre there alternative projects which similar functionality like HUD which work together with many window managers without too much pain?\n\nA: The problem is your Desktop Environment i.e. Unity, is a plugin of the Window Manager Compiz. \nSimilarly GNOME 3 is a plugin of Mutter. \nSo thing is that, the menus of your Window Manager are tightly coupled to the Dash of the Desktop Environment, which can be only done via a plugin. \nIf there were a Unity plugin for Mutter or Kwin or other Window managers, then they could be used too instead of Compiz\n", "Q: What is the schema XML file in the data/glib-2.0 folder of my Quickly application? I created an Ubuntu application with Quickly, and I can see an XML file in the folder data/glib-2.0 of my project root and I am not exactly sure what this is for. The XML looks like this:\n<?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"UTF-8\"?>\n<schemalist gettext-domain=\"sample-application\">\n  <schema id=\"net.launchpad.sample-application\" path=\"/net/launchpad/sample-application/\">\n    <key name=\"example\" type=\"s\">\n      <default>''</default>\n      <summary>Sample setting</summary>\n      <description>Longer description of this sample setting.  Talk about allowed values and what it does.</description>\n    </key>\n  </schema>\n</schemalist>\n\nFurthermore, in the default preferences dialog code that is created with a new application, I can see the following code:\nsettings = Gio.Settings(\"net.launchpad.sample-application\")\nwidget = self.builder.get_object('example_entry')\nsettings.bind(\"example\", widget, \"text\", Gio.SettingsBindFlags.DEFAULT)\n\nand I am not sure what this is doing.\n\nA: The XML file defines a set of keys you can use throughout your application to store user preferences. \nIn the element schema, you will notice two attributes: id and path. The id is what you use to refer to the schema in the code when instantiating the settings object. The path is where the keys are stored.\nYou can find the settings by installing the dconf-tools package, and running dconf-editor. Then navigating to the node defined above. The node in the XML in the question (/net/launchpad/sample-application) would be here:\n\nThe schema is used against the GSettings API. You can see the GTK C based docs here: http://developer.gnome.org/gio/stable/GSettings.html. This is a part of the Gio module\nAs for the code.\nsettings = Gio.Settings(\"net.launchpad.sample-application\")\nThis creates the GSettings object, that you can use to bind widgets to for storing settings. The parameter needs to match exactly the id attribute of the schema element in the XML.\nsettings.bind(\"example\", widget, \"text\", Gio.SettingsBindFlags.DEFAULT)\nThis creates a binding between the example key in the schema, to the text property of the widget. The value that gets passed to the key is the text property of the specified widget. For GtkEntry, text is the most obvious property to use. Because it is being bound, whenever you change the value of the property in the preferences window, it is automatically updated. The final parameter determines which direction the binding works - see the docs for more information. \nThe type you specify in the XML for the key should match one of the available options. Generally a single character, which you will see against the defined constant. E.g. for a boolean:\n\n#define G_VARIANT_TYPE_BOOLEAN              ((const GVariantType *) \"b\")\n\nSo boolean equates to b.\nSo, just say you wanted a boolean key, you could add the following beneath schema element, alongside the other key:\n<key name=\"complete\" type=\"b\">\n  <default>false</default>\n  <summary>Whether the task is complete</summary>\n  <description>This key is used to determine if a particular part of the application is complete or not</description>\n</key>\n\nThen bind the active property like so:\n# Get the widget (named chk_complete)\ncomplete = self.ui.chk_complete\n# Bind the property\nsettings.bind(\"complete\", complete, \"active\", Gio.SettingsBindFlags.DEFAULT)\n\nSettings can then just be accessed with the get function, specific to the data type. e.g.\nsettings = Gio.Settings(\"net.launchpad.sample-application\")\nexample = settings.get_string(\"example\")\ncomplete = settings.get_boolean(\"complete\")\n\n", "Q: No media player working  except VLC by an ordinary user  I am using ubuntu 12.04 64 bit on my machine.\nNow a days as anormal user whenever I try to play any media player on my system except VLC, the system simply hangs for about 10-15 minutes and throws an error in terminal.\nFor Rhythmbox:\navinash@titanic:~$ rhythmbox\nBus error (core dumped)\nFor Banshee\nFor Amarok\nFor Clementine \nFor super user all the above media players do work. But what for ordinary user ?\nPlease help.\n\nA: It seems to be that when you launch these programs (apart from vlc) as normal user, you cannot access your audio hardware (hence the bus errors and permission denied). As you don't want to run these media players as root all the time, one quick fix that sometimes works is to add your user to the audio group (normally you don't have to do this in Ubuntu) with sudo adduser <your username> audio. This will add your existing user to the existing group. I had to do the same with VirtualBox, i.e. add myself to the vboxusers group to let it access my USB hardware. \nNote: you must logout and then login again for the group changes to take effect for your user.\n", "Q: How do I hide other users folder? I have used vsftpd to create and FTP server.  I am using Ubuntu 12.04 desktop version. I want to show directories that are assign to that user only.\nFor example, I have created users \"a\",\"b\",\"c\" and groups \"developer\" and \"tester\". The users are added in the group as follows:\n\"a\"----> \"developer\", \"tester\". \"b\"----> \"developer\". \"c\"----> \"tester\".\n\nI have created \"developerdoc\"(owner-root, group-developer) and \"testerdoc\"(owner-root,group-tester) directory in the /home folder and assign all user's home directory as /home.\nNow when I log in with user \"a\" then it should shows me directory \"developerdoc\" and \"testerdoc\" because user a is in the both of these group.\nIf I log in with user \"b\" then it should shows me directory \"developerdoc\" only. The directory \"testerdoc\" should not listed.\nThe same is tre for user \"c\" only \"testerdoc\" should be listed.\nPlease guide me how in how I can achieve this.\n\nA: I don't think that is possible. As both folders share the same parent folder, and all users should have access to that parent folder, all must have at least read and execute permissions to this parent folder -- and thus can see all files/directories located therein. This is true even if they had no access to some file/subdirectory therein: they could still see (but of course not read/exexute) it.\nTo make it easier to understand, let me give you a picture: Let's say /home is a \"closable street\" with a watched entry. So you give somebody permission to pass that entry and walk the street. Though all houses (subdirectories, i.e. /home/*) are closed to him (you didn't give him permission/keys to enter any house), this visitor will still be able to see the houses. He may be unable to enter them -- but you cannot hide them from him while at the same time permitting him to walk the street.\nSo with this story: If the visitor should not see the houses, don't let him walk the street is the only way. With your directories: The only way to hide them completely, is not to permit entering /home. But why does this bother you, if they cannot enter the other directory (or even tell what is in there)?\n", "Q: Chromium-browser always reports it didn't shut down properly Chromium-browser always reports it didn't shut down properly when I first start it after a shutdown/reboot.\nI guess I could close it manually first before shutting down, but other apps seem to be ok with stopping themselves as the system shuts down, so why is chromium having a problem (and can it be fixed)?\n\nA: If the problem persists try removing rm -r ~/.config/chromium/\n\nA: There's been a few updates for 12.04 and the problem seems to have gone away.  Maybe they fixed something.  \n", "Q: Unity: Nautilus folder opens in background I am used to open a folder from the keyboard with a shortcut. The alternatives are:\n\n\n*\n\n*Use Unity Dash with the shortcut SUPER + F to open the Dash File Lens\n\n*Open Kupfer with the configured shortcut (CTRL + ALT + SPACE, in my case)\n\n\nThen I type the name of the folder and press ENTER if it is selected.\nHowever, the window that opens up is not active but in the background.

It does not happen when the only other selectable entity is the Desktop.\n\nA: This is NOT the default behaviour.Check the settings of Focus and Raise Behaviour in CompizConfig Settings Manager > General > General Options.(You may need to install ccsm first).\n\n\nA: For me the problem is NOT solved by checking Auto-Raise, rather, by changing Focus Prevention Level from Low to Off in ccsm.\n", "Q: Some importants shorcuts of Blender do not work on Ubuntu In Ubuntu (and Mint) some important shortcuts for Blender do not work.\n\n\n*\n\n*Alt + right click to select an edge loop (heavily used on all 3D software) doesn't work, a useless menu of Ubuntu pops up to ask if the application must be closed or minimize.\n\n*Ctrl + Alt + 0, to define the current view as the camera view, minimizes the application. This shortcut of Ubuntu is useless, it's faster to click on the minimize icon.\n\n*Ctrl + number to apply a subdivision surface level does nothing on Blender, it's one of the most used shortcut of Blender.\nFor the moment I stay on Windows 7 just to use these 3 shortcuts.\n\nA: Sorry this seems to be coming a bit late, I've only just seen your question.\nTo allow Alt+RMB, the best option is to switch the Alt key to the Super (Windows) key using dconf-tools.\nsudo apt-get install dconf-tools\n\nUnder System Tools, you should now have dconf-editor.

Note that this will show as \"Ctrl Cmd Numpad 0\"\nFor your last problem, I'm not sure why you're having issues with the subsurf shortcuts.  It's never been an issue for me, so I'm not sure what to advise.  You could try the Blender input settings.  They're under the same User Preferences -> Input tab, but they're listed in two places.  You'll probably need to update them under both 3D View -> Object Mode and 3D View -> Mesh.\n\nA: I found it easier changing the shortcut for that function in Blender:\n\n\n*\n\n*Go to File / User Preferences / Input\n\n*In the search field at top right type the word Camera\n\n*Beside the line 'Align Camera To View' you'll see the current shortcut Ctrl+Alt+Numpad 0.\n\n*Click on that and press the keys you want. In my case, I pressed Ctrl+Shift+Alt+Numpad 0.\n\n\nA: For Alt+RMB (edge loop select), you can use Shift+Alt+RMB instead.\nFor Ctlr+Alt+Numpad 0, even simplier, you can just disable it in Ubuntu's Keyboard Setting.\nScreenshot\n", "Q: Error on boot 12.04 When I boot my Toshiba Tecra(nvidia) say no protocol specified (2x and ..) a lot of.

Recently, my laptop started displaying the message 'GRUB loading...' while emitting a really loud beeping sound (using the mute and volume adjustion keys had no effect), which always persists for a good minute. Then, when I finally get to the boot menu, I can not move the selection, it does not respond to 'enter' which should initiate the selected loader, and none of the other options work either.\nAlthough I am not sure whether it is the cause, it started the day after I spilled a small amount of tea near the lower area of my laptop, although before I shut my computer down (after which I was unable to start it up anymore), only the '6' and left shift keys stopped working.\nI have no idea on what to do, as I am relatively new to *nix systems, and I could not find anything useful on Google. I have tried rebooting multiple times, as well as not using my computer for 12 hour to let whatever tea was left in there dry out. Could someone point me in the right direction?\n\nA: Ah, the beep sound while the GRUB menu being displayed is due to some key being pressed before hand. If you release the key, the screen will load well and you can select any entry that you wish.\nI encounter this at times when I keep the down-arrow key pressed at the time of booting itself. The beep comes, I release the key, the menu appears, and the highlight goes down automatically (the effect of the down that I pressed earlier) and then everything is normal.\nSo in your case, I do believe that tea might have short circuited some key. Hence it is exhibiting the behavior I mentioned above. Good luck fixing it.\n\nA: IIRC the beep sound may be turned on/off by edit /etc/default/grub.\nThere's a command line which should be uncommented.\nBut by default the beep sound of Grub2 is off. How did you turn it on?\n", "Q: Can't Install Ubuntu 12.04 on New Machine I built a new system with the intent of using Ubuntu 12.04 as my primary OS, but I am unable to install it. Every time I boot, the splash screen with the options to try or install Ubuntu appears as it should. When I make a selection, regardless of which option I select, the system freezes. The above mentioned splash screen with my option highlighted remains on the screen and a hard reset is the only way out.\nI am currently running Windows 8 RP without any major issues. I have been trying to install Ubuntu from a USB flash drive with little success. I do not have an optical drive and would really like to avoid having to use one. \nI tried two flash drives (a 4GB Sandisk and a generic 2GB one from a eBay seller in Hong Kong). I've used both UFDs to successfully install various distributions of Linux in the past and the Sandisk to install Windows. I tried UNetbootin and the Windows command prompt to prepare the drives and I tried these methods with the 64-bit and 32-bit versions of both Ubuntu 12.04 and Ubuntu Studio 12.04. The result is always the same: a frozen screen shortly after boot.\nThe relevant specs on my system are listed below:\nIntel i5-3570K Processor,\nMSI Z77A-G45 (Fintek F71889AD) Motherboard,\nPatriot G2 DDR3 1600 Ram (4GBx2),\nIntel 330 Series SSD 60GB,\nEVGA Nvidia Geforce GTX 460 SC\n\nA: It sounds like a video problem, but lets start at the beginning with the download.\nThe alternate iso will sometimes avoid some video problems, so try that if the below suggestions fail.\n1) Did you md5sum check the downloaded iso?\n  See https://help.ubuntu.com/community/HowToMD5SUM\n  Check the number against the listing in the link for your release listed at\n  http://releases.ubuntu.com under the MD5SUMS link.\n2) If using a CD, did you burn the CD as slowly as possible?\n  See https://help.ubuntu.com/community/BurningIsoHowto\n3) Did you select the media check before trying to install?\n https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Installation/CDIntegrityCheck\n4) Did you ever do a \"memory check\" (another live-media menu choice) on your PC?\nDoing the above can save you a lot of time struggling with a bad install media.\nWhen booting, at the first screen with the little person and keyboard icons, type return, then select your language.  This may also skip some video problems.\nAt the Try/Install/Test menu screen, read the bottom line and under the kernel options (F6 I think), select nomodeset.  This hopefully will let things run, like the memory test or the Try option.\nIf the Try option works, getting you to a desktop, then you can install from there, or select the \"install\" choice next time.  \nStill problems, try the alternate iso.\n", "Q: Which partition should I install on on a Dell XPS 13? I just bought the dell ultrabook xps 13, but I have some difficulties to install ubuntu 12.04.\nProblem is about Hard-Disk partition.\nActually, the sda has already 4 part : \n\nand I don't want delete the wrong part ...\nThis is the information from windows :\nsda1 = OEM (100% free according windows, 33MB used on 41MB according linux ...)\nsda2 = RECOVERY\nsda3 = windows7\nsda4 = standBy extended (hibernation) (100% free according windows, unknown according linux)\nI think I should avoid to delete windows7 or RECOVERY, then it's between sda1 and sd4.\nFact is that I don't know what is OEM and hibernation seem pretty useful ...\nIf you have an idea or informations, thanks for your help :)\n\nA: OEM is the partition that stores the bootmanager of windows 7. This drive enables you to boot from restore partition. (This occurs when you insert recovery disk)\nYou are correct you should not delete sda2 or sda3.\nThing I would recommend.  \n\n\n*\n\n*Create the restore disk if not done already. \n\n*Delete sda4. Right click and create a new extended partition. A extended partition is a wrapper to many logical partition. \n\n*Inside that extended partition create a partition that will be used as SWAP partition.\n\n*Create another partition to install ubuntu. With / as mount point.\n\n*Rest place you can create more partition in ntfs. That will be accessible to both OS. \n\n\nNOTE: According to screenshot you are installing GRUB in sdb, make sure its correct\nHere is the partition scheme of mine (dell xps 15)\n\n\nA: I have tried this and yes it works smoothly, no problems with the dual boot. Here is procedure that I adapted:\n\n\n*\n\n*With your bootable Ubuntu USB/CD select the option try Ubuntu and then run the Gparted partition manager.\n\n*First delete the Hibernation partition (don't worry it will not damange the existing windows OS or boot manager).\n\n*Next right click the unallocate free space and create an extended partition.\n\n*Within the extended partition create three logical partitions (home, root and swap), for the first two select ext4.\n\n*Now you need to assign mount points to these, you can use \n\n*\n\n*sudo gedit /etc/fstab\n\n*and add the following lines:\n\n*/dev/sda5 /home ext4 defaults 0 2\n\n*/dev/sda6 / ext4 defaults 0 1\n\n*(replace /dev/sdaX with the corresponding location on your notebook).\n\n\n*Next you can proceed with actual installation (using the install icon in the left panel).\n\n*Choose install Ubuntu side-by-side with Windows and then select advanced partitioning for more control at the bottom of the next dialogue box. There you can control and direct ubuntu to use the 3 logical partitions you just created. Select and Edit each of them and in the \"Use as\" dropdown menu select ext4 journaling file system and under the \"mount point\" dropdown menu specify the corresponding mount points for home /home, for root / (here is a nice video of this that helped me: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_trEVXBgLg) \n\n*Now you are ready to press install, you can confirm that installation will not touch the windows partition by selecting those windows partitions, click change and it should say: \"do not use this parition\" then press cancel.\nGOOD LUCK :)\n\n\nA: I would avoid deleting sda1  ,it seems Windows reserved MBR , so sda4 seems good enough for ubuntu installation.\nFrom the image sda4  is 8.5 GB so you can reserve 2 GB for swap space and remaining for ROOT / partition.\nFrom the above image MENU , you can select that sda4 partition to be deleted ( don't worry just for allocation process), which will later show as unallocated , then ADD the Unallocated partition and  set the SIZES to create swap and Root \"/\" (ext4)  partitions . \nFrom the last drop-down Bootloader menu  option select SDA not sdaX  for installing Grub . And you are good to go.\nNote : Avoid storing large sums of DATA in Ubuntu  home partition , you may run out of memory soon enough :)\n", "Q: How to change primary group I want to remove user pserver from the group apache.\n#deluser pserver apache\n/usr/sbin/deluser: You may not remove the user from their primary group.\n\nNow I want to add a new primary group, so I ran the following;\n#usermod -G pserver pserver\n\nWhich returned the following:\npserver` is now in group `pserver\n\n#groups pserver\npserver : apache pserver\n\nNow I want to remove the user again from group apache, but I get same error again.

You want option -g to change the primary group. I.e. your command should have been:\n# usermod -g pserver pserver\n\nNote, this will also change group ownership of files in the home directory, but not elsewhere.\nMore generally, the syntax for changing user 'user' to have primary group 'group' is:\n# usermod -g group user\n\n\nA: The question as placed by the OP is misleading. The title reads \"How to change primary group\", however in the question body its clear the intent is to not just replace the primary group but also remove the previous primary.\nIn case anyone wants to just replace the primary but not remove it from the list, one simply has to add the previous primary back to list.\nSo, after following StarNamer's post, one only needs to do a\nadduser user previous-primary-group\n\nbecause the usermod command will have thrown out your previous primary group from the list of groups you belong to.\n", "Q: Ubuntu Server - downloading speed suddenly reduced to < 5KB/sec This happens on some of my Ubuntu servers but not all.

I did the following trick:\nhttp://junkypc.com/enable-dual-core-processors-ubuntu/\nBut after that when I was trying to shutdown the system it seemed like shutting down forever so I had to use forced shutdown by holding power.

Thanks in advance and my regards for all linux community :)\n\nA: Dual core processor are well supported. That tutorial is for old (very old) ubuntu.\nTo confirm you can run cat /proc/cpuinfo to get the cpu information.\nalso you can see how ubuntu is using processor cores by running system-monitor (gnome-system-monitor)\n\nIf you feel your ubuntu is running slow. There are some distros that can help you work flawlessly. \nLubuntu & Xubuntu both based on ubuntu but less resource hungry.\n", "Q: Extra Mouse button assigned to Super-W short cut I have assigned my middle click mouse button to the shortcut Super-W in Ubuntu 10.04, now I need to change this binding, but I can not remember how I did it...\nI've not used Btnx,xbindkeys, this are not installed... \n\nA: That sounds more like something set via CCSM/CompizConfig Settings Manager.\n\nA: Have you seen this?\nMap caps-lock key to middle mouse click\nThere's an app named xdotool in the question.

(I heard about something called ibus could help.) I want to get the phonetic output in Sinhala Unicode, when I input some phrase in in English.\nIs there a way to fix this...? Appreciate any help, Thanks!\nMy SCIM settings : \n\n\n\nA: iBus is still significantly inferior for most of the half-dozen or so IMEs I use regularly, so it's still SCIM all the way for me.  They both use the same modules (so an identical list of input-method engines, scripts etc. are available) but SCIM doesn't mangle any of them like iBus does in places.\nFor Sinhala in particular, the m17n engine works very nicely.\n\nA: We've got success! Gunnar Hjalmarsson has provided a patch that resolves the issue. I have a 64-bit system, and it works fine. I can't say about the 32-bit systems, although I expect it should work fine. \nHere I am spelling out exactly what you need to do:\nAdd \"ppa:gunnarhj/misc\" to your system's Software Sources. Do this by typing \"Software & Updates\" in the dash and opening the tool by that name. Once it opens, go to the \"other sources\" tab and click on \"add\". In the window that opens, paste his PPA, i.e. \"ppa:gunnarhj/misc\". Once that is done it will ask you to click there to update the online sources. Once that is finished, then open \"software updater\" from the dash, and update your system. Make sure in Language Support that the keyboard input method system is still set to scim and not ibus. Then log out and log back in, and it'll be good to go.\nIf you want to directly read from his site, go the bug I have created on this issue. See Gunnar's post, and go to the link he gives. There you'll find more detail on the matter i.e. just what is in his ppa. But for those who are newb's, the directions I've given above will I think be easier to follow. \nEnjoy using scim-m17n! \nRegards,\nSwarup \n\nA: Just leave SCIM alone and begin installing iBus.. which contains a lot of unicode languages. :-D To change the settings, goto system settings>iBus\n", "Q: Overheating problem in Samsung NP550P7C Laptop I've been struggling with some issues.

I have 2 different SATA drives in my PC, a 160GB and a 200GB.\nI'm unsure how to do this, and have a choice between them when I boot, any ideas?\nIs there a guide out there for this?\nI installed XP on one, then ran Ubuntu on it as 'Install With' it just boots into XP, I then reformatted, and put them both on separate drives, and it does the same again. I then tried Win 7, then Ubuntu on the second; again, no show, can someone please lend a hand?\n\nA: You need to determine which drive takes priority in boot up. This settings can be visiable in BIOS.\nIf you don't to change BIOS,You need to install grub in that disk.\nSay you have installed windows system on disk1 (160GB) and installed ubuntu on 200GB.\nNow according to BIOS if disk1 is top list, ubuntu won't boot. As by default grub is installed in 200GB.\nTo correct it,\n\n*\n\n*Boot up with ubuntu live disk/usb.\n\n*Install boot-repair.\n\n\nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:yannubuntu/boot-repair && sudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get install -y boot-repair && boot-repair\n\nDo a recommended repair. That should fix the issue.\nAlternatively\n\n*\n\n*Click on Advanced, Goto Grub-location\n\n*Change Place Grub to correct device .\n\n\nA: I am assuming that currently Win7 is in first drive and Ubuntu in second SATA drive , then while booting select the Boot menu from BIOS ( same as selecting the CD drive or Usb drivve when you install a new system)   and select the Ubuntu Installed Drive to boot from.\nIn BIOS select your First boot device as Ubuntu installed SATA drive for easier access , which also avoids the manual installation of Grub Bootloader to Windows MBR.\nThen after booting in Ubuntu run\nsudo update-grub\nThen from next reboot you will get the OS selection menu from GRUB.\n\nA: This is a very easy task to accomplish. Ubuntu's installer is configured to put the boot loader by default on the hard drive where you install Ubuntu. The boot loader is also configured to find other boot loaders and include them in the menu. You only have to make sure that the hard drive where Ubuntu is installed on is the first hard drive in the boot order.\nDoing it this way will not touch the Windows boot loader, which means you could remove the Ubuntu drive and still can boot Windows. Installing the Ubuntu boot loader to the Windows disk of course will break this and is not recommended.\nYou can of course use tools like the mentioned boot-repair. But if you want to get things right I'd recommend reading the manpages, like the one for grub-install, and the Ubuntu and sometimes Arch Linux wiki pages.\nThe grub-os-prober, responsible for making Dual Boot configurations easy, can also be disabled, so that only Ubuntu related menu entries will be generated when running uptade-grub from terminal. Some other Linux distributions ship default configurations like these.\n", "Q: Sync problem on windows 7 I use UbuntuOne on Ubuntu 12.04 and Windows 7.

To simply remove one or multiple specific programs, run in a terminal:\nwine uninstaller\n\n\n\nA: If the application you're trying to uninstall doesn't show up when you run wine uninstaller, proceed.\n\nNote: The following command wipes out all the programs installed in the default Wine prefix. Be advised. Since Windows programs may store data and documents on the \"virtual\" Windows drive contained in your .wine folder, you must make sure any valuable files are saved elsewhere first!\nTo completely delete the Wine prefix, run the following command.\nrm -r ~/.wine\n\nThe next time you run Wine, it will create a new prefix by itself.\n", "Q: How do I copy a folder keeping owners and permissions intact?

How can I have cp keep the ownership and permissions from the original?\n\nA: Use sudo cp -a /home/my_home /media/backup/my_home, it will recurse into subdirs and preserve all file attributes.\n\nA: Use the -p flag.\n-p     same as --preserve=mode,ownership,timestamps\n\n--preserve[=ATTR_LIST]\n       preserve the specified attributes (default: mode,ownership,timestamps), if possible additional attributes: context, links, xattr, all\n\nNote that for the permissions to be correctly replicated, the destination file system should be the same as the source file system.

What I would like to do is be able to boot Ubuntu without a monitor, but then be able to switch back to it, and still have a graphical desktop running. I have read about creating a headless Ubuntu server, but the guides I have found all seem to involve disabling the graphical session altogether. How can I set this up?\nEDIT:\nMy Ubuntu computer is a HP Pavilion a1120n.\n\nA: Ubuntu has a great \"FEATURE\" (ok, it actually sucks) that disables/stops booting your system (and/or) graphical system if there is no monitor.

So if you have 'lightdm' you would create a 'lightdm.override' with the single word 'manual' in it, and put it in the '/etc/init/' directory. You will need to use 'sudo' to create and edit the file. Same with the grub file in the link I provided.\nYou can start the xserver/GUI manually:\nsudo service lightdm start\n\nand to stop it:\nsudo service lightdm stop\n\n", "Q: How do I remove Ubuntu on my computer? \nPossible Duplicate:\nHow to remove Ubuntu and put Windows back on? \n\nI want to remove my Ubuntu on my computer.\nWhen I go to Windows, I decide to format the disk but I got this:\n\nCan someone teach me how to remove Ubuntu on my computer using Windows 7\nThank you in advance!\nI also got this:\nhttp://s1186.photobucket.com/albums/z373/a26776500/?action=view&current=Image1-2.png\n\nA: *\n\n*If you installed Ubuntu inside Windows (via Wubi), follow this guide.\n\n*Else, you can uninstall any OS (Ubuntu, Windows...) via this little tool: OS-Uninstaller\n\n\nA: Ubuntu is probably installed in the 14.75 GB OEM Partition shown in your image since the others are all NTFS (which means Windows) or much too small.\nI think you are trying to delete the 117Mb System partition (which is probably diagnostics software for your PC).\nWhile you may be able to delete the Ubuntu partition, doing so may render your PC unbootable. If your PC boots via grub in the Ubuntu partition (which is likely), deleting this partition will stop the PC from booting up at all as grub won't find it's boot files, so won't be able to boot either Ubuntu or Windows!\nIf you are confident about it, then instructions for replacing grub's bootloader by the Windows bootloader can be found here. http://www.linuxbsdos.com/2012/03/10/restore-the-windows-bootloader-to-mbr-after-dual-booting-with-linux/\nHowever, since it's only using 14.75Gb of your approx 400Gb disk, I'd recommend just forgetting about it until such time as you are doing a reinstall of Windows (when you can just reformat the whole disk).\n", "Q: Is it possible to add the Ubuntu Software Center to sources.list? I would like to install some of the things on the Ubuntu Software Center via command line (apt-get).  Is this possible?  If so does anyone have the url handy to add to sources.list?

There is no PPA. \nWhen you click on an application in the USC, you just can scroll down and see the package name.\n\n(look under version)\n", "Q: How can I rename items in places I don't own, like / , and why shouldn't I? I get a Permission denied message when trying to rename files and folders in places like /, /usr, and other people's home directories. I'm an administrator. How can I do this?\nAlso, I've heard that renaming files and folders like this could be dangerous. Is that true? Should I not be doing this?\n\nA: Even if you are an administrator, when normally using your desktop, you have typical user privileges. This way, anyone who gains access to your account (e.g. a virus) would not have complete control of the system.\nTo run a program with administrative privileges, you need to use gksu form the Alt-F2 prompt, or sudo in the terminal. For example, pressing Alt+F2 and typing gksu nautilus, will prompt you for a password (to prove that it's really you) and launch a file browser with administrative privileges. With this window, you will be able to modify anything on the system, BUT BE CAREFUL\nIn particular, you shouldn't mess with anything outside of /home unless you know what you're doing. The other folders contain system files. Modifying those files could cause your computer to break. If you're trying to accomplish a specific task, and aren't sure how to fix it, you should open a new question to get instructions on how to fix it. Often times, there are easy fixes that won't break your system.\nFor example, renaming the /usr folder will break nearly every program on your computer, including the programs required to use your graphical interface... \nIn other words, you need to be fairly experienced with Linux in order to fix that kind of problem.\n\nA: It is usually bad to rename items that reside directly in / or directly in any of its subfolders (like /usr). In fact, you should avoid renaming anything outside your home directory unless you are sure you need to do so and that you're doing it correctly. Otherwise, you might rename something critical to the functioning of your Ubuntu system, causing it to stop working (or stop working properly).\nIf you find yourself asking something like the question above, you should consider posting a new question, where you provide more information about what you want to accomplish, or add details if you've already asked your question.\nIn the Terminal\nTo rename a file or folder in the Terminal, use the mv command (the same command used to move a file or folder from one place to another on the same partition):\nmv old-name new-name\nIf the file or folder resides in a folder where you do not have write permissions (which is often the case when you are not its owner), then you must run run this command as root with sudo:\nsudo mv old-name new-name\n(Or you could use sudo -u username mv old-name new-name to perform the renaming operation as another non-root user, if you prefer. Also, please note that if you have write permissions on a directory you don't own, but its sticky bit is set, you won't be able to rename files inside it that are not owned by you, without using sudo.)\nIn Nautilus\nYou can run the file manager, Nautilus, as root by pressing Alt+F2 and running the command gksu nautilus. This will let you rename files and folders anywhere and do all sorts of other powerful and dangerous things.\nBe careful, and remember that any programs you launch (like by opening documents) from a root Nautilus window will also run as root, and make sure to close the window when you're done so you don't later confuse it with a regular, safer Nautilus window.\nBut please do not rename stuff outside your home directory, unless you really, really know what you are doing. It will probably break your Ubuntu system badly. And it will probably not accomplish whatever you are trying to achieve.\nThanks to richard for helping to clarify the conditions under which a user  can rename an item without a Permission denied error.\n\nA: I can propose the following workaround. To rename folders under / directory simply:\n\n\n*\n\n*Create new directory with desired name: sudo mkdir /newdir\n\n*Give access to this directory: sudo chown -R user:group /newdir\n\n*Copy files to your folder: cp /olddir/filename.ext /newdir\n\n*Remove old directory: sudo rm -r -f /olddir\n", "Q: Wi-Fi doesn't work well , disconnect (but connected) every 10 minutes I'm running Ubuntu 12.04 (with all drivers updated).\nI'm connected to my wireless router, everything works well, but after 10 minutes using Firefox / Chrome / Skype / transmission  the connection is lost only on Ubuntu.  Other devices still have a connection to the Internet.\nUbuntu is still connected to the router but no access to internet, even the router address is not accessible.\nI have to  disconnect and connect the Wi-Fi to establish a new connection.\n\nA: Have you tried installing the drivers for your wireless in the 'additional drivers' section of your system settings? Often these problems occur because of incompatible or faulty drivers. \nIt may help others to answer your question if you specify:\n\n\n*\n\n*Are you using a laptop? What is the make and model?\n\n*What wireless hardware and drivers are you using?\n\n\nAlthough it is a discontinued support program you should take a look at some of the documentation on the ubuntu wiki that can help diagnose and guide you through any hardware compatibility issues:\nDoes Ubuntu Support the hardware configuration on your Laptop?\nIs your wireless card supported?\nIt may be easier to just surf through the Ubuntu Friendly site.\nSometimes the network struggles with WPA. User Erik Dietrich has a possible solution:\nLaptop Wifi problems \nTell me if any of this works.\n\nA: At my laptop I have the same. I think this is bag of network-manager because I connect to my Wi-Fi though terminal and it works ok.\nIf you want to connect through terminal do this: 1. Install dhcpcd sudo apt-get install dhcpcd. 2. sudo ifconfig and find out your wireless card.(usually it wlan0 or eth2) 3. Find what networks are available sudo iwlist <wireless card> scan. 4. Choose your network sudo iwconfig <wireless card> essid <wireless network name>. 5. Connect to network sudo dhcpcd -d -t 10 <wireless card>.\n\nA: Every time I setup Ubuntu (any version) on my Dell Precision M2400 I have to fix the same problem. For me it's a power management issue and I've bookmarked this guide to fix it http://uselessuseofcat.com/?p=67\n\nA: As Erik mentioned in his post(Laptop Wifi problems), it is better to remove ubuntu default network-manager and use Wicd network manager... I had same problem and now it solved.\nErik suggestion:\nsudo apt-get install --reinstall wicd\nsudo service network-manager stop\nsudo apt-get remove --purge network-manager network-manager-gnome\nsudo service wicd restart\n\n", "Q: Moving Deja Dup Backups From Dropbox to Ubuntu One Is there a way where I can instead transfer/upload all my previous Deja dup backups from my Dropbox to my Ubuntu One and then from there, Deja dup will just continue synching with it whenever it performs its scheduled backup operations?\n\nA: Déjà-Dup saves his files in a normal folder, so I believe that you can do following:\n\n\n*\n\n*1) create a folder on Ubuntu One with the web interface\n\n*2) upload all your Déjà-dup files (from dropbox) to Ubuntu One in the new folder\n\n*3) set Déjà-dup client to save the backups on Ubuntu One in the folder you created on step 1\n\n\nI have not tried this myself but I don't see why this shouldn't work.\n", "Q: Cannot choose windows installation \nPossible Duplicate:\nUbuntu 12.4 and XP on Seperate Drives, Dual Boot, How? \n\nI've never used Linux before in any form, but was always intrigued, so after a while of deciding whether to risk it I installed Ubuntu 12.04\nDuring the installation I was asked \"what would you like to do?\" Install Ubuntu as the only operating system, alongside another os, or something else.\nI chose something else as I wanted to format one of my old 100Gb IDE drives to serve as the partition to install ubuntu on.

I would still like to be able to use Win7 for gaming.\nAny help on this matter would be greatly appreciated. :)\n\nA: You say you have two drives. It seems as if your computer has given priority to the one containing Ubuntu.\nRestart your computer and keep tapping F12 until you enter the menu with device selection for booting. From here, select the 1 TB drive and you'll boot into Windows.\nIf you want the computer to boot into Windows by default, you'll have to set the 1 TB HDD as the top priority boot device.\n\nA: Try This:\nTry opening a terminal and running sudo update-grub. It should mention finding a windows partition. If it does, then you will have the option to boot windows.\nYou may also need to set the timeout on the bootloader. See 'Setting the Timout' below.\nIf that doesn't work...\n... we need to do a little more work.\nYour windows install should be (hd1) to grub (since it should be the first BIOS drive that isn't the drive grub is running from). Press alt+f2 and paste this line:\ngksu gedit /etc/grub.d/40_custom\nAfter a password prompt, a text editor should open. Put this at the end of the text file:\ncat << EOF\nmenuentry \"Windows 7\" --class windows --class os {\n    set root='hd1'\n    drivemap -s (hd0) (hd1)\n    chainloader +1\n}\nEOF\n\n(P.S: I hope the above is correct... I don't have a dual boot machine here for reference, so I'm going off of memory, /boot/grub/30_os-prober, and intuition I've gained from working with a lot of messed up boots. It won't break anything though. Worst case is the menu entry doesn't work.)\nThen save the file.\nOpen a terminal, type sudo update-grub, and press enter\nYou will probably also need to set the timeout, as explained below.\nSetting the Timeout\nPress alt+f2 and paste this line:\ngksu gedit /etc/default/grub\n\nAfter a password prompt, a text editor should open. Look for a line with GRUB_TIMEOUT (it should be near the second line)\nIf there is a # character in front of it, remove that character. Make sure the timeout is set to 5 (or higher if you want. This will be how long you have to choose an OS before the default is used). The complete line should look like\nGRUB_TIMEOUT=5\n\nNow save this file, close the text editor, and open a terminal.\nIn the terminal, type sudo update-grub, press enter, and reboot.\n", "Q: Graphical terminal misinterpreting input I've been having this weird problem with typing commands into gnome-terminal.

Also you may note how dangerous this becomes when using sudo.\nI don't know if anyone has had similar issues and couldn't find anything while googling.\n\nA: Have modified your bash prompt, PS1? what is its current value set to? If you have bytes that don't add to the length of the prompt, such as terminal escape sequences, and fail to enclose them in \\[ \\], bash will think the prompt is longer than it is, and lines will wrap around incorrectly.

Is it possible to set a disk quota on a file folder?\n\nA: Aside from a loop mount as arhimed suggests, the only way I know of doing this would be to use XFS, which supports \"project quotas\": quotaa for specified directory trees, not just entire filesystems.\n\nA: Install quota . It will help you to set limit amount of memory.\nsudo apt-get install quota\n\n\nA: The granularity of quotas depends on the filesystem you are using. \n\n\n*\n\n*XFS implements project quotas (already mentioned by grifferz)\n\n*ZFS implements quotas and reservations, and, since with proper \nplanning at the layout stage it is able \nto handle any directory as nested filesystem, it is able to \napply a quota to a specific directory.\nFor a brief explanation of quotas in ZFS, I recommend \nthe BSD Documentation, for the complete treatment, \ncheck Oracle.\n\n", "Q: Mplayer music library like banshee or wmp Hi I have been looking around for a plug in to make mplayer act as a music library but to no avail.\nDose any one know of one ?\nMy aim is to find one media player that can do music and films (must support x264 banshee dose not) a bit like windows media player but on Ubuntu.\n\nA: Banshee should support x264 if you have the plug-ins installed for it, which I believe are not installed by default.

Next click on Skip. \nI had already waited 2 hours for the language pack download to finish and it was still showing 184 minutes left.\nNow I'm using Ubuntu without the pack and as I restarted the PC, I get the \"Finish the language pack\" option which means I can download them now. \n\nA: I recently installed Ubuntu 12.04 and it took me about an hour to completely download and install those language packs. I have connection with downloading speed of 100Kbps. I think you'll have to wait for the language packs to download. It's very irritating but you have to bear it (like I did) :)\n", "Q: E: Unable to locate package airodump-ng So I have installed aircrack-ng and now trying to install airodump-ng but I am getting the following error message.\nE: Unable to locate package airodump-ng\n\nQuestion is, do I still need airdump if I have already installed aircrack?\n\nA: As I remember, airodump-ng is a part of aircrack-ng  so it should be installed already.\n\nA: If you installed the aircrack-ng package, you already have the airodump-ng executable:\nek@Apok:~$ airodump-ng\nThe program 'airodump-ng' is currently not installed.  You can install it by typing:\nsudo apt-get install aircrack-ng\n\nJust run it. (Here's how.)\nAs for whether or not you need to use airodump-ng, that depends. From the official site:\n\nAirodump-ng is used for packet capturing of raw 802.11 frames and is particularly suitable for collecting WEP IVs (Initialization Vector) for the intent of using them with aircrack-ng. If you have a GPS receiver connected to the computer, airodump-ng is capable of logging the coordinates of the found access points.\n\nIf you need to do any of that, you should likely run airodump-ng. Otherwise, you may not need it.\n", "Q: Port seems to be open, but connection refused I am trying to open port 3000 on Ubuntu 12.04, cause I have a web server listening there.

In that case port should be opened on cloud service level. In particular among AWS you should be looking for \"Security Groups\" where you need to open access to port 3000.\n\nA: If your server is listening on the localhost interface only, you won't be able to access it from a remote computer. This appears to be your primary problem, as only 127.0.0.1:3000 is listed in your netstat output.\nYou will also need to ensure that \"mydomain.com\" resolves to the correct IP address for your machine, such that connecting to it will result in communication with the external interface of that machine.\n\nA: I had this problem recently with a nodejs HTTPS server, and the solution to it was not to use \"localhost\", \"127.0.0.1\" or even the domain name. It was to use \"0.0.0.0\"\nI believe this acts as a wildcard, now allowing for public resolution via the domain name and it also works with \"localhost\"\nEdit: Here's a link to a serverfault page on the 0.0.0.0 topic: https://serverfault.com/questions/78048/whats-the-difference-between-ip-address-0-0-0-0-and-127-0-0-1\n", "Q: Is hibernation supported with the Intellibook on 12.04?

When I type mount on the root of my Ubuntu system I get the output \n/dev/xvdal on / type ext4 (rw,noatime)\nI want to know what is the meaning of /dev/xvdal in this?\n\nA: You are on a Xen VPS(or virtual machine); xvd* are simply the Xen disk storage devices (Xen Virtual block Device). They appear instead of sda, etc. when you are using the more efficient paravirtualized Xen disk drivers instead of straight-up SCSI disk emulation. If you list the installed modules (drivers) on a Xen HVM, this driver will show as blkfront (or xen_blk if you are running on a very old Xen version--pretty rare). \nIn short, treat xvda1 exactly as you would sda1 on a regular PC. \n\nA: It's probably /dev/xvda1 rather than /dev/xvdal.\nVirtual storage devices, representing cloud storage (or paravirtualized storage generally, as izx has pointed out), are typically exposed in Ubuntu through /dev/xvd nodes. /dev/xvda1 is the first partition of the first such device (just as /dev/sda1 is the first partition of the first SCSI or SCSI-like storage device).\n", "Q: Removed swap when editing fstab file-not sure I wanted to remove the warning when starting Ubuntu (Continue to wait, press S to skip or M for manual recovery). I did it! But what I did not want to do was removing my swap partition. I am not sure if I have really removed it, I only removed the line in /etc/fstab file. This solved my problem with warning, but on the other side, I've lost my swap partition. \nIs there any way to recover the swap partition (I think I did not remove it, only unmounted?) ? Or at least getting the old one's UUID? I do not understand file systems in Linux with Home folders and so completely. \nThanks for the answers.\n\nA: From what I'm reading, I don't think that you have removed the swap partition. Getting the swap partition's UUID is easy by typing in a terminal: blkid. One of the lines should contain the word swap. That line should look something like this:\n/dev/sda5: UUID=\"e911d747-0add-49dc-a37d-7b6b16656c2f\" TYPE=\"swap\" \n\nNow, edit /etc/fstab by typing in the terminal: sudo gedit /etc/fstab. Add a line saying:\nUUID=swap's-uuid-number none swap sw 0 0\n\nSo, in my case, it should be:\nUUID=e911d747-0add-49dc-a37d-7b6b16656c2f none swap sw 0 0\n\nSave the file, reboot. You should have your swap partition mounted automatically again.\nIf blkid doesn't show a swap partition, you should create a new one. I'd advice you to do that via the tool gparted. Install it via sudo apt-get install gparted or via the Software Center, then run it. In gparted, select an unused area, then click on the new partition button (it looks like a document with a green plus sing on it), and make sure you format it as linux-swap or swap, can't really remember what it's called again. A good swap partition should be 2 times the size of your RAM. So if you've got 2GB of RAM, make sure that your swap partition's size is 4GB. When you've done that, blkid should show have a line containing swap. Continue using the instructions above.\n", "Q: Wireless card causes ubuntu 12.04 to freeze on startup I am currently running Ubuntu 12.04 64-bit with a TP-Link TL-WN851ND wireless card.

When I do so, will my settings and all the packages I have installed get transferred or will I only get the default Factory version?\n\nA: No, they will not; it appears you are using a Live-USB with the persistent storage option, which creates a separate file to hold all your user data and installed packages, etc. You will have to copy data manually after the install and reinstall any additional packages. \n", "Q: Wireless keeps disconnecting after a while with a WNDA3100v2 I have an WNDA3100v2 wireless USB dongle, which I got working via the ndiswrapper. But randomly it disconnects.

I did EVERYTHING to try and resolve this issue on my daughter's desktop. We are using a wireless USB Network adapter and more times than not the internet just crawled or cut out completely. \nThings I tried:\n- Resetting the adapter\n- moving the adapter\n- reinstalling the adapter SW\n- using a different wireless USB adapter\n- AntiMalWare Scan\n- disabling the onboard wired adapter through Device Manager\n- Flashing Bios\n- updating USB drivers in Device Manager\n- Reinstalling Win 7 Ultimate from scratch\nI was going crazy.....   The signal was FULL at 4 to 5 bars at all times. (Her bedroom is on the 2nd floor... kind of far from the wireless router)\nThe resolution? Well....  I noticed that when I moved away from the adapter, the web pages loaded instantaneously. The problem was that even though it showed 4 or 5 bars, we were blocking the signal to the adapter when we were sitting in her chair). I moved the adapter using a long usb connector cable and situated it where it would not be blocked at all while sitting in front of the monitor.\nThe moral of the story?  Before going nuts, move the adapter so that it is free and clear of all obstructions!!!! 4 or 5 bars mean nothing.... The signal bar may still show full even though the adapter is blocked.  \n\nA: That adapter/version has the BCM4323 chip which has spectacularly poor support on Linux -- neither the b43 driver nor Broadcom's proprietary wl binary driver supports it. \nThe disconnects are probably related to the ndiswrapper/Windows driver rather than IPv6. I would try to consider replacing that with another dongle that has better Linux support. \n\nA: Limit your download speeds in your torrent client to about 300-350 kb/s. There is also a command line program called trickle which can help you limit your download speeds of your updates and anything else. Run a search on that for how to you use. I'm using the same adapter and had the same problem. All is well have been connected all day and downloading at 350 kb/s which is tolerable...\n", "Q: 12.04 Running slow when downloading files I've been using Ubuntu for a while now, and just upgraded to the latest version about a couple months ago.

This is common on older computers which use the slower PATA drives, as opposed to the newer SATA drives. \nThough even SATA drives can be slow if too much data is being read or written. You can monitor drive activity with iostat available in the sysstat package.\nIt can also be caused by a failing hard drive. Run dmesg, and look for any lines mentioning your drive. Or even better, run dmesg | grep sda1, assuming your drive is /dev/sda1. You can also install a \"SMART\" drive diagnostic tool from the Ubuntu Software Center such as gsmartcontrol to see the physical health of the drive.\n", "Q: How do I configure Juju for deployment on Rackspace Cloud?

If that is correct, then you should have not reason to need additional driver installed. The only thing you might need drivers for would be a extra graphics card(Nvidia for example), the jockey program usually finds the graphics card without any problem, so it is highly unlikely that you need one.  \nThe driver for most of your software is already part of the Linux kernel, that is why the additional drivers window comes up blank; all your hardware is already supported.\nIf you know that you have a non-integrated graphic card but the additional drivers program is not finding it you need to post another question with just the specific information that you have X graphic card but that is is not found by the additional drivers program jockey\nNot sure I understand the last part of your question, I don't know what you mean by \"install the graph\" no programs come to mind with that description, could you clarify exactly what function you are trying to accomplish... \n", "Q: How to keep Internet connection while changing between eth0 and wlan0?

The server creates one\n  socket for each client, and these sockets share the same local socket\n  address.\n  Protocol: A transport protocol (e.g., TCP, UDP, raw IP, or\n  others). TCP port 53 and UDP port 53 are consequently different,\n  distinct sockets.\n\nWhen you change your network connection usually you get a different IP address, thus the earlier opened socket becomes invalid for the new connection. You'll only achieve what you want if you find a way to keep the same IP address for both wired and wireless connections.\n", "Q: Solving Permission denied problem When I try to install GIST program these words appear:\n\nPermission denied\n\nSo what does this mean and what can I do to solve this problem?\nmarwa@marwa-Vostro-1540:~$ cd Desktop/GIST_1.0/\nmarwa@marwa-Vostro-1540:~/Desktop/GIST_1.0$ ./GIST\nbash: ./GIST: Permission denied\n\n\nA: Permission denied when trying to run a file in the current directory usually means you don't have the execute permission for the file.

So, as I said I have a VPS, Raspberry Pi and a plan, but I am in need of some advice, so here goes. \nI have a VPS with prgmr.com which I ahve up and running nice and smoothly without any issues.  I also have a new RaspberryPi sat on my desk, with Raspberrian downloading as I type.  My plan is to use the Raspberry Pi as a backup server at home, so my question is this:\nHow would you go about backing up a remote Ubuntu VPS via SSH?\nThe VPS is setup as a web server, but I would like to set up a cron job on the Pi so that it can automatically login to the VPS and run then download a backup, just incase I manage to brick the thing or something else happens that results in me losing data.  Naturally I want this backup to contain everything so I can quickly restore the whole server, all nicely configured as it is now if things go bad.  \nHow would you go about running this sort of backup?  I figured that I would have to write some kind of bash script to SSH in, compress all the relevant files into a tar.gz or similar and the download the images vis SCP.  \nWhat are your thoughts on this?  What packages etc would you use, and how would you configure it?  The VPS has a LAMP stack on, so what files would you aim to backup?  It also has lots of other smaller programs such as GIT, and ZendTools installed.  \n\nA: SSH Public Key Authentication\nThe first thing you want to do is start with ssh public key authentication. This will let your script use SSH without a password.\nAll that the server needs is SSH installed, and public key authentication set up for the user that will be running the backup script from the RasPi.\nHere's a good tutorial for public key authentication: https://hkn.eecs.berkeley.edu/~dhsu/ssh_public_key_howto.html\nOption 1: SSH and Tar\nYou can compress the tar.gz from the server and transmit it directly over ssh with something like this:\nssh root@remoteserver.example.com \"tar -czvf - / 2> /var/log/sshbackup\" > vpsbackup.tar.gz\n\nThis will make the VPS tar and gzip all files on / and transmit it over SSH to store in vpsbackup.tar.gz on the RasPi. A log of the most recent backup will be kept on /var/log/sshbackup on the VPS.\nOption 2: Rsync\nSending an entire .tar.gz over SSH is inefficient... Files that don't change will still be transmitted. A better solution is to use rsync, but this makes it difficult to make a .tar.gz that preserves permissions. If you have enough storage space on the RasPi, you can just store the backup files as plain ol' files. Then you can have a script tar.gz them if you want to keep multiple past backups.\nThe server needs rsync installed. This will run over SSH, so you still use the public key authentication, and keep the encryption. You will need to run this command as root and have public key authentication and SSH logins for root enabled to preserve permissions. Your destination (or at least a temporary destination) should be a Linux filesystem. If you're storing these backups on a FAT or NTFS partition (e.g. on most external hard drives), you can make a loopback filesystem (see http://www.walkernews.net/2007/07/01/create-linux-loopback-file-system-on-disk-file/) for temporary storage. The tar.gz file can be stored on any partition, because it preserves permissions on its own.\nAn example rsync command:\nrsync -a --delete --exclude=/dev --exclude=/sys --exclude=/proc --exclude=/tmp remoteserver.example.com:/ /path/to/backup/destination/\n\nbe careful when using --delete, especially as root! It will delete any files in the destination directory that do not exist on the backup source. You should only use --delete when syncing to a dedicated backup directory being used only for that VPS. You should also make sure there is no possibility of your script syncing to the wrong destination (e.g. if /path/to/backup/destination is determined by a shell variable)\nrsync will only transfer files that are different between the source and destination. If you have large files, it will also only transfer parts of the file that have changed (for this to work, you must add the -c flag). This means you are using minimal bandwidth, but it'll use more CPU and slow down re-sync preparation times as both sides need to first checksum files to determine which blocks to transfer. If you do use the -c flag and you have large files (such as database files) and/or a flaky connection, consider adding --partial --append, which enables you to resume transfers after a connection is interrupted.\n", "Q: System crashes when converting many images in Imagemagick with one command After upgrading to precise, I have several times had my system freeze completely when I try to convert to many (100, 200) jpegs or pngs to pdf.

I am looking for something like a graphical interface / front end for Imagemagick or a simpler application that would allow converting/extracting images from pdf files through the interface (not in the Terminal).\n\nA: (The question poser added 'not in the terminal' only after I had posted this; however, it still stands as a relevant answer and useful for people, particularly regarding the evince point, which is a graphical app)\nYou can extract individual pictures from the pdf reader evince just by clicking and dragging them onto the desktop; sometimes you have to click more than once, but it generally works and I have found it really useful! Also, if you right click the image in the pdf you can save it in another image format instead of the default .png.\nTo extract all images from a pdf, you can use pdfimages, which is part of the poppler-utils, and is in the repository, although you probably have it installed anyway. That package has a number of other tools as well. To extract images in jpg (and the program's native format,ppm), just enter pdfimages -j name.pdf <picture name>. Call the picture name whatever you want, and the images will be successively labelled as dog1.jpg, etc. You can obviously specify absolute locations if you want with pdfimages -j ~/KeyGuides/TSENG.PDF ~/Scripts/DOG (where DOG is not a directory, but the name the pictures will use).\nPdfimages is quite a simple program, but I'll see if I can find any other tools, as I manipulate images/pdfs a lot too.\n\nA: A GUI to convert images to/from pdf  is gscan2pdf.\nI found about it here.\nMore here. \n\nIt allows importing a pdf and saving images in (various) formats, \n\n\nand also importing images and saving them in pdf-format \n\nSo, the program is able to convert between the following formats: pdf, gif, jpeg, png, pnm, ps, tif, djvu.\n", "Q: How to run an executable file through JRE by default?

I tried to reboot into Ubuntu after removing a Kubuntu installation from my PC and resizing my Ubuntu partition using my 11.10 live CD. When I rebooted, grub showed a black screen and said \n\nError: no such partition\n  grub rescue >_\n\nI booted into my live CD again, Ubuntu was still installed and all my data was still there. I still cannot boot into Ubuntu. What should I do?\n\nA: It looks like Kubuntu was still in control of GRUB. When you removed it, you also removed the files grub needed to boot. Fortunately this should be an easy fix.\nSince you're already on a live CD, I think the easiest route is to chroot to your installation and run the grub installation scripts. Start by opening your Ubuntu installation (your root partition, which contains folders such as \"etc\", \"usr\", and \"home\") in a file browser in order to mount it.\nNow open a terminal.\nFind the Mount Pount\nIn the terminal, type mount This will print out several lines. Look for one that mentions your ubuntu installation in /media. It will look something like:\n/dev/sda1 on /media/disk type ext4 (rw,relatime)\n\nIn the example above, the device is /dev/sda1 and the mount point is /media/disk. Make a note of this, because we will use this information later.\nSet up the Chroot\nWe need to setup the chroot. This means we will link some system folders from the LiveCD to your installed system. To do this, paste the following text into the terminal, but replace /media/disk with the mount point you found earlier:\nfor i in sys dev proc; do sudo mount --bind /$i /media/disk/$i; done\n\nThe above command runs the following three commands:\nsudo mount --bind /dev /media/disk/dev\nsudo mount --bind /sys /media/disk/sys\nsudo mount --bind /proc /media/disk/proc\n\nThis binds /sys, /dev/ and /proc to the same folders on /media/disk. This means that /media/disk/dev/ is actually /dev/\nNow we are ready to chroot. In the terminal type chroot /media/disk, where /media/disk is your mount point.\nYou should now see a root shell (the prompt should end in #). Any command executed here is restricted to your installed partition, and will (for the most part) operate as if you  were on your installed system.\nFix the Bootloader\nNow all we need to do install the bootloader. In the terminal, paste the following two lines:\ngrub-install /dev/sda\nupdate-grub\n\nNote: This assumes that you only have one drive in your computer. If you have two, or if you are running from a LiveUSB drive, make sure you replace /dev/sda in the above command with the device from the \"Find the Mount Point\" section above. Do not include the number at the end of the device. For example, if the device for your partition is /dev/sdb2, then you should use grub-install /dev/sdb.\nAnd that's it! If those commands complete without error, then reboot your computer.\n\nA: Try reinstalling grub from a live CD boot?\n\nA: Please boot a live CD, and select to Try Ubuntu. Open a terminal and run:\nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:yannubuntu/boot-repair && sudo apt-get update\n\npressing enter when prompted. When this finishes, run\nsudo apt-get install -y boot-repair && boot-repair\n\nand use the default settings. At the end, it will give a link.

This shouldn't prevent you from updating the rest of the system.\n\nA: Whatever that Google repository was, it's gone now. If it was a PPA, you can try removing/unchecking it in Software Sources. If you added those lines manually to sources.list, remove and run sudo apt-get update. \n\nA: Found a mirror of that site here: http://aptproxy.linuxdeepin.com/dl.google.com/linux/deb/dists/testing/non-free/binary-i386/\nLooks like it contained the apt repo for Picasa, which Google has officially discontinued for Linux.

I'm using Lubuntu 12.04, with xfce4-volumed installed, see this question. When I'm changing the volume using FN+Vol-, a nice notification balloon pops up. This is what I want. However, when I try to change the volume 10 seconds later, I first have to click the 'Clear all notifications' button to get further notifications. I want to get rid of this: xfce4-volumed should always be giving notifications, whether or not I've clicked the button.\nHow can I get this done?\nAnswers that tell me how to disable the whole envelope thing, or change it by another notification daemon to get this done, are also welcome.\n\n\n\nA: I solved this by installing the XFCE-popups.

I need to encrypt some files on my machine. I did not select the option do encrypt my home folder at installation, but since there was an option to do so I am guessing that Ubuntu has some inbuilt encryption utility. If so, what is it and can I use it to encrypt certain files on my system (not just home folder) ??\n\nA: I use the following two encryption programs: truecrypt and openssl; the first allows you to create any size of encrypted container, and the second allows you to encrypt individual files; folders must be tarred before encrypting, as the target to be encrypted must be one single chunk of data.\n\n\n*\n\n*Truecrypt is an excellent program, but is not available in the repositories, so you must go to truecrypt.org to download the program; you want the 'standard' version, and it is available in 32 or 64bit. After downloading, open the terminal and cd to the containing folder and enter tar -zxvf <truecrypt download file>, and then chmod +x <truecrypt setup file>, and then sudo ./<truecrypt setup file>.  (You need to use sudo as it will install to the system folders.)\n\n*Then follow the onscreen prompts and truecrypt will be installed. After that it is best to run it as normal user when you want to create a volume, but with gksudo when you want to mount a volume. (If you create a volume as gksudo, root will own it, and so you would have to chown it for your user to regain ownership.) \n\n*When creating a volume in truecrypt, there are a lot of options, and even whole usb flash drives, external hard drives, internal hard disk partitions, and more can be encrypted. Even though a long discussion of these aspects of the program is not relevant to this answer, there are several other important things to note. In particular, it can be useful to format the truecrypt volume's filesystem in FAT32. The volume will then be easy to open if the file is transferred to a Windows system, as a volume created with the FAT32 option will be able to be opened by the Windows truecrypt executable. \n\n*The volume truecrypt creates is in a sense similar to that created with virtualbox; i.e. a virtual disk with its own filesystem. There is good documentation on the site that explains in great detail how to use the program. Also, after installation the pdf guide should be in /usr/share/truecrypt/doc/TrueCrypt User Guide.pdf.\n\n*I also use openssl (installed as default) to encrypt various files and tarred archives. I use the same commands as given in this section of the Unix toolbox, but I repeat them here for completeness, credit to Colin Barschel. The first command encrypts; the second decrypts in both the files and the folder examples:\nFor files:\nEncrypt:\nopenssl aes-128-cbc -salt -in file -out file.aes \n\nDecrypt:\nopenssl aes-128-cbc -d -salt -in file.aes -out file\n\nFor tarred folders:\nEncrypt:\ntar -cf - directory | openssl aes-128-cbc -salt -out directory.tar.aes   \n\nDecrypt:    \nopenssl aes-128-cbc -d -salt -in directory.tar.aes | tar -x -f - \n\n\nA: Here you are. There is a how-to on the community help Wiki:\nhttps://help.ubuntu.com/community/PostInstallationEncryption\n\nA: Try Cryptkeeper. You can use this to encrypt specific folders.\n\nA: I would use TrueCrypt instead because it gives you more control over encryption and offers you more options.\n\nA: Use the new Gnome EncFS Mountmanager\nhttp://www.webupd8.org/2013/05/gnome-encfs-manager-cryptkeeper.html\nCrytkeeper is at the end of its lifetime.

You probably have to set the executable bit for the file chmod +x <file-name> to make it work properly.\nThat being said, you have to be careful when manually creating files in the file-system (not speaking about your home folder), as nearly all files are managed by a package management system.

I've installed Ubuntu on an old laptop, which I plan to stick in a drawer and never open again, for use as a file and media server, and all is going well except that I'm having some problems with permissions.\nI set the Downloads folder so that it's shared through Samba and everyone and their sister has read/write permissions, which is how I want it. However, when a new folder is created inside of it, it does not inherit those permissions.

I usually use Ubuntu software centre to install programs but I sometimes use apt-get install instead. Is the Ubuntu software centre method just a user interface equivalent of the apt-get install commands? I use Ubuntu 12.04\n\nA: Except for paid apps as tachyons has pointed out (which can be installed and uninstalled with apt-get but only once purchased in the Software Center), the Software Center is primarily a front end for the various apt- commands--not just apt-get. For example, the Software Center will also search for packages and let you edit your Software Sources.\nThe main practical distinction between the two is that the Software Center will automatically fetch information about what packages are available from where and in what versions. In contrast, when installing or upgrading software with apt-get, you should run sudo apt-get update first if you haven't done so recently. sudo apt-get install ... does not (ever) cause sudo apt-get update to be run automatically (though it may be run automatically up to once a day as part of automatic updates in the system).\n\nA: Yes , software center is just a gui front end of apt , but paid apps and some of the free apps which is submited through my apps portal are not available in apt-get\n\nA: Yes.

I find synaptic faster.\n", "Q: Notification and indicator applets in Gnome Classic I am running a GUI-enabled Ubuntu 11.10 Server installation using Gnome Classic.

I recently asked this question about how to encrypt software on my machine. One of the answers suggested Cryptkeeper, so I installed it from Ubuntu software centre. The installation proceeded without reporting any errors, but I am unable to use the software. I access it from my System Tools menu and absoultely nothing happens. Has anyone else experienced this problem? Is the best solution to uninstall and reinstall or is there something I am missing in how to use it (although I don't see how) ?? I have never experienced any problem like this before with installed software - it always 'just works'.\n\nA: *\n\n*The Cryptkeeper indicator doesn't show in the Unity panel on the top-right in 12.04. This is a known bug.\n\n*Until the bug is fixed, the workaround is to whitelist its indicator via dconf-editor; install it via the dconf-tools package if necessary.\n\n*Open dconf-editor, go down to Desktop-->Unity-->Panel, and add the highlighted part as shown in the screenshot. Then close.\n\n\n*Logout, start Cryptkeeper, and the indicator should now appear as below:\n \n\nA: As an alternative solution using gsettings check the existing value:\ngsettings get com.canonical.Unity.Panel systray-whitelist\n\nWhich will give you a result similar to:\n['JavaEmbeddedFrame', 'Wine', 'Update-notifier']\n\nNow simply set the value after adding 'Cryptkeeper':\ngsettings set com.canonical.Unity.Panel systray-whitelist \"['JavaEmbeddedFrame', 'Wine', 'Update-notifier', 'Cryptkeeper']\"\n\nThis is exactly the same result as the original answer but preferring the command line over dconf-editor.\nThis also works well on Ubuntu 12.10. Just make sure you add Cryptkeeper to your startup programs for the icon to show on startup. Multiple icons will appear if you start the program more than once.\n\nA: The workaround with whitelist works with Unity, only.\nIf your desktop environment is Gnome, then you (additionally) need to add \"Notification Area\" to the panel:\nMove your mouse over the panel and press Super + Alt + Right-Click, then choose \"Add to Panel\" and select \"Notification Area\".\n\nA: For Ubuntu 12.10 Quantal Quetzal,\nPlease see  How to make Startup Applications in ubuntu  to make Cryptkeeper work.\nFor how to install, \nI use Ubuntu Software Center and search Cryptkeeper and install.\n", "Q: when setting up a webserver on linux , is it a good practice to make a new user and install everything under that user? I want to set up a webserver and I understand that when using linux its not safe to install things under root. So should I install things like apache and php under a different user? And if i do, will everything be installed in the /usr directory?\n\nA: When using Linux you should not run things as root unless it's essential. This means that most installations will actually be done as root, normally by using the sudo command (or the GUI equivalent) as this ensures that all the files can be put in the right locations, with most files being below the /usr directory.\nThe Apache developers are well aware of security concerns and, by default, will install the webserver to run as a specially created user; on my system, most of the apache2 instances are running under the user www-data which I believe is the default (it's a long time since I installed it).\nI think you can override the default locations for the actual web files during installation, but normal practice is to use the default (/var/www as I recall) and then link subfolders to there.\nIn summary, taking the defaults of the installation (run as root or using sudo) will give you a reasonably safe setup and you don't need to take any special action.\n", "Q: Using GUI without root privelege Total noob here, just loaded Ubuntu 12.04 for the first time yesterday. Loaded Cinnamon desktop also, to try out both it and Unity.\nI downloaded an application SMathStudio.exe into my Home/Downloads folder, unzipped it, made it work on mono in Cinnamon by right-clicking. So far so good.\nBut where should I keep it, what's the Linux philosophy? I tried to drag and drop it into  /usr/bin but couldn't, can't drag and drop without root privelege. It just fails, doesn't even ask for your password.\nSo opened a terminal and \"sudo cp\"-ed it into /usr/bin. Except now that it's there I can't run it, can't double click it, can't add a shortcut to the Cinnamon menu as \"sudo mono SMathStudio.exe\" fails, opens a terminal and gives heaps of error messages.\nSo what's the general principle of where applications should live, and how you should access them in Cinnamon?\n\nA: There's no hard and fast rule for this.  Generally you can put things like that in ~/bin, add it to your path if you want it from the command-line, and add a .desktop file in /usr/share/applications if you want it in Unity.  \nAt least for me:\nIf it's in /bin implies linux standard.\nIf it's in /usr/bin it implies distribution standard.\nIf it's in /usr/local/bin it implies a one-off of distribution standard or something you did yourself that you want accessible to all users.  \nThat being said, if you want it run-able by all users you need to sudo chmod +x random.exe it.\n", "Q: Guest Additions in Virtualbox problem IN UBUNTU 12.04...\nAfter installing Guest Additions, I restarted, then, I logged in.

So I've come back to linux because I've fallen back in love with the command line (albeit I'm not so great with it) and the customability of linux based OS's. My question really comes from not knowing how to customize certain aspects of the OS.\nTo begin with, I want it to look like this.\n\nI have only gotten it to work like this.\n\nSo I'm running the cairo-dock with unity bar. But a couple of annoyances. I don't know how to get that little window thing to go away on the lower left corener. It allows you to switch between the four workspaces, but doesn't look as clean. Secondly,my \"Top bar\" doesn't look like the one I want to replicate, because I don't know where to begin. Any solutions for my two problems?\nUpdate #1:\nInstalling Gnome 3 seemed to give me a bar on top that looks closer to the outcome, but it doesn't work with cairo.\n\n\nA: Also, the icon theme in the top picture is Faenza.\nTo install:\nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:tiheum/equinox\nsudo apt-get update \nsudo apt-get install faenza-icon-theme\n\nThen choose your icon theme using eg.

I have a UPS which is configured with Apcupsd. It shows all the stats correctly. The problem is that when I switch to battery mode, something sends a shutdown signal to the PC. My guess is that it might have something to do with the power utility from system settings. It can see when it's charging, and when I plug it out it shows for about 16 minutes of battery life, but it's shutting it down anyway. Can it be disabled?\n\nA: I think by default, ubuntu is configured to shut down or hibernate when battery reaches critical level. This could be the source of your problem. \nTry disabling the critical battery level automatic shutdown as shown here - http://looselytyped.blogspot.in/2012/04/preventingdisabling-automatic.html\n", "Q: Is there a program that edits audio files to have the same volume? When listening to music in Banshee or any other player, I always have to up the volume for certain songs and turn it back down for others because they don't have the same replay gain.\n\n\n*\n\n*Is there an add-on which could normalise my songs in Banshee? \n\n*Or is there a program which could do this to whole of my music library?\n\n\nI'm currently running Ubuntu 12.04 in case that has any effect on the answers.\nThanks in advance.\n\nA: I don't think there is an add-on for Banshee itself, but you can normalise volume across your collection. On AVP, I've found two ways to get it done:\n\n\n*\n\n*sox: install via sudo apt-get install sox or the Ubuntu Software Center. In a terminal, navigate to the directory where your music files reside using the cd command, then type sox <input-file.mp3> <output-file.mp3> gain −n −3. This will normalise the mp3 file's level to -3 dB relative to full scale deflection.\n\n*normalize-mp3: this application is the way to go when you're handling multiple files. Install via sudo apt-get install normalize-audio or the Ubuntu Software Center. In a terminal, navigate to the directory where your music files reside using the cd command, then type normalize-audio -b *.mp3 for artist albums, or normalize-audio -m *.mp3 for mix albums.\n\nA: I use a command line utility called mp3gain, which is available in the repositories.\nTo use it, go into the directory where you store your music files, and then run this command:\nfind -name '*mp3' -exec mp3gain -r -k {} \\;\n\nIt will go through every subdirectory, finding any file ending with .mp3, and normalize the gain so that they will also play back at a consistent volume.\nAlso note that mp3gain won't act on files that are already within the range you want, so the second time you run it and thereafter, it won't take as long as the first time. So you can just run this command as is every time you add new files, whether its just one new file, or a whole bunch.\nIf you happen to have .ogg files, there is a similar program called vorbisgain:\nfind -name '*ogg' -exec vorbisgain -r {} \\;\n\nThere are options for how you normalize the gain for any one song in comparison to the rest of the music you have, but it's been so long since I've looked at them I can't really say much about it. I just know that I play my entire library as one huge randomized collection, and the above comand and its settings has worked for me for years.\nIf you happen to have .flac files, you can use metaflac:\nfind -name '*flac' -exec metaflac --add-replay-gain {} \\;\n\nHope that helps.\n\nA: You can use audacity to normalize the volume of you whole music library. \n\nAudacity is a free, easy-to-use and multilingual\n  audio editor and recorder for Windows, Mac OS X, GNU/Linux and other\n  operating systems. You can use Audacity to:\n  \n  \n*\n  \n*Record live audio.\n  \n*Convert tapes and records into digital recordings or CDs.\n  \n*Edit Ogg Vorbis, MP3, WAV or AIFF sound files.\n  \n*Cut, copy, splice or mix sounds together.\n  \n*Change the speed or pitch of a recording.\n  \n*And more! See the complete list of features.\n  \n  \n  One of these features, is Adjust volume with Compressor, Amplify,\n  Normalize and Fade In/Out effects.1\n\nNote:  Using audacity will affect the quality of your music.  But, if your music library is all high quality mp3, I mean 256 and 320 kbit/s, and the sampling frequency is 44.1 and 48 kHz, you probably will not notice a quality loss (drop).  Now audacity claims that they have significantly improved Normalize, but I think that this should be kept in mind before you try to normalize the sound.\n1Source:Audacity\n", "Q: Deluge tray icon is not clickable in KDE since 12.04 In Kubuntu 11.10 I could click the tray icon and deluge's window would show, but now on 12.04, nothing happens.

Is there any way to disable this behaviour for certain specific apps(like guake, rhythmbox, etc). I just want them to start without their icon appearing on the launcher. Any ideas. Help would be highly appreciated. \n\nA: Normally this can be done using window manager hint (_NET_WM_STATE_SKIP_TASKBAR), which can be triggered in Compiz using Window Rules plugin (manageable using compizconfig-settings-manager) or using wmctrl, for example:\nwmctrl -r Rhythmbox -b add,skip_taskbar\n\nThis would normally hide icon from taskbar in most desktop environments. Unfortunately, Unity currently doesn't support these states for already opened window, there's even a failing test (test_invisible_windows.py) for Unity 5 with an eloquent comment: \"We don't support changing window states after they've been mapped.\"\nSo unless there's some way to launch target applications with a required window state, this, otherwise standard solution, is a dead end.\nThere might be some Unity-specific solution specific (e.g. a key for a launcher/.desktop file).\nUnfortunately, there doesn't seem to be any easy solution, so the best chance might be to revive bug #750728 or open the new one.\nThe aforementioned test was removed for Unity 6, so it seems that Unity developers aren't interested in fixing this bug (or it's a very low priority).\n", "Q: How do I remove duplicate Chromium extension: Unity Integration?

I'm hooked up to a UPS battery, and the logs always show that reboot happens within a minute or two of the crash.\n\nA: A few questions:\n\n\n*\n\n*Does it reboot at roughly the same time of day? \n\n*Are you running automated updates? (You should be.)\n\n*Have you enabled automated updates to reboot the system?\n\n\nIf so your system is not crashing, it is rebooting to install an update that requires a reboot.  On Linux/Unix, this is generally a kernel update.   On Windows, it could be pretty well anything that can't be unloaded without a reboot.\nI have noticed a relatively high rate of kernel updates recently.  Good news is bugs are being found and fixed.  Bad news, is a reboot is required.\nOn my system automatic reboots are controlled in the file /etc/apt/apt.conf.d/50unattended-upgrades.  The line that controls it begins Unattended-Upgrade::Automatic-Reboot and take a true or false value.  If you don't allow automatic reboots, you should be notified that a reboot is required when you login.\nEDIT: There are other packages besides unattended-upgrades.  Some of them may trigger a reboot.  They should all invoke apt to do the upgrade.  Check /var/log/apt/history.log to see if updates are occurring before the reboot. \nIf the reboots are occurring at roughly the same time, then there may be something in the crontabs that is causing the reboots.  \nIf the system really is crashing, it may be the BIOS which is rebooting the system.  You may want to change the power on state setting.  \n\nA: I had some hardware problems earlier, and whenever my system crashed, it would not reboot.  As a result, I think that when Ubuntu gets a kernel panic, it won't reboot, but will instead flash the caps lock light and display the same thing that it did when it crashed.

However, I can get sound by listening through headphones plugged into the jack.\nAny ideas on how to get the speakers to work?\nI have an hp pavillion dv6 laptop running Ubuntu 12.04.\n\nA: You should probably start here : \nhttp://www.alsa-project.org/main/index.php/Help_To_Debug\nYour problem is likely to be a bug in the \"patch\" code for the driver. (As in \"patch panel\" not \"software patch\".)\nThe process of working out what the problem is is influenced heavily by your sound hardware. \nFor similar problems with my Intel HDA setup, I found the HDA Analyzer utility to be helpful - this lets you manipulate card parameters manually. And also this codec graphing tool, which helps to visualize how the patch layout of the card should work.\nAlas, advice for other sound hardware is outside my experience.\nAt a minimum level you will be able to feed back information to the ALSA team for future kernel versions. I was able to patch the kernel to fix my problem (my C is terrible, but the code concerned is quite simple), and get a fix into the main kernel with assistance from the team on the Ubuntu kernel IRC channel, but I appreciate this is probably not a standard user response to the problem :-)\n\nA: I have your laptop model and I've never gotten around to troubleshooting my headphone problems because I discovered a workaround: in alsamixer (either from terminal or the GUI version in repos) if I max out Master and zero out speaker the audio will come from my headphones.. \n", "Q: Risk of failing to use \"Safely Remove Drive\" What happens when the user selects \"Safely Remove Drive\" when the drive is a USB Flash Memory device and what is the risk if the user simply pulls the drive without selecting that operation?\nI am on Precise (12.04) and the drive is a USB 3.0 flash memory.\n\nA: When the user selects \"Safely Remove Drive\", the partition of the media (in this case the USB flash memory) is \"unmounted\" as soon as the drive has finished its current operation(s).\nThen, it's safe to proceed and physically remove the USB stick, because the drive is \"switched off\".\nIf you do not \"eject\" the media, meaning that is still mounted (i.e. linked to a directory, usually in /media), and you remove the drive, you can corrupt the files on the USB stick, even if you think the system is not reading/writing anything on the drive itself. So my advice is to always eject it. \nThis is just a quick answer, you can also check this article: http://lifehacker.com/5863810/do-i-really-need-to-eject-usb-drives-before-removing-them\n", "Q: Will python scripts be run when added to /etc/network/if-up.d? To get my system connected to internet, I have to manually login via the web page of my ISP. This is not very convenient.

I open up a terminal and run the script every time. \nI try to put the script in /etc/network/if-up.d so that it runs automatically when the interface is up.

Is there any other folder I have to put in?\n\nA: Yes, it should.\nDoes it have a dot in its filename? run-parts (8) ignores files with dots in their name.\n\nA: In order to answer your question I created the following in /etc/network/if-up.d/python:\n #!/usr/bin/python\n f = open('/tmp/aaaaa','w')\n f.write('')\n f.close()\n\nThen I executed:\n chmod +x /etc/network/if-up.d/python\n\nin order to make it executable.\nI double checked that /tmp/aaaaa did not yet exist.\nWhen I then took down my wifi, and brought it up again, /tmp/aaaaa appeared--so it worked.

Assuming you are using libglib2.0-0 version 2.24 which is current for Ubuntu 12.04, I'd suggest that you report the bug in Launchpad under webkit, since it's a common denominator. Chromium runs tabs under separate processes and may use webkit differently in other ways, too.\nAfter the bug is triaged a different cause may be determined, but I think that would be a good start.

I'm writing a Notational Velocity clone for Gnome/Ubuntu using Quickly (PyGI) and I want to allow users to set a global shortcut key that will toggle the visibility of the app window when the app is running (something like Tilda does for its terminal emulator). I.e., once the app is launched, a user could press F2 to hide the window, and then press F2 again to make it visible and bring it to the front. I don't want to use an external hotkey app or anything that requires out-of-app settings. How would I go about this?\nThere's a similar question here: How can I listen on global keypress event? but the main answer there is a cludgy non-programmatic solution. One commenter mentions \"grabbing the keyboard with an X api call\" but I'm not sure where to start with that.\n\nA: The Keybinder library does exactly this.  If you check pull requests there are requests in for examples using pygi, one of which is me for py3k.  \n\nA: I realize this is an external setting, not in app, but I thought I'd write how to do this since I couldn't find documentation online.\nI needed to read some compiz settings recently for my program, so figuring out how to change them was fairly straightforward.  You can programatically set compiz settings in python using python-compizconfig.  I've played with it a little bit and you can set values like so:\nimport compizconfig\ncontext=compizconfig.Context()\ncommandplugin=context.Plugins['commands']\nc0=commandplugin.Screen['command0']\nc0.Value='xeyes'\nkey0=commandplugin.Screen['run_command0_key']\nkey0.Value='<Control><Primary>g'\ncontext.Write()   #Note that sometimes you have to pass False to get it to update settings\n\nThe above sets the commands plugin of compiz to run xeyes using control-g keycombination. You'd probably have to do a check to make sure that the plugin was running (mine was off in ccsm by default).  Note that to get many of the settings you can use the keys() function to list them (i.e.) context.Plugins.keys()\nHere's a link to code that helped me figure out how this works, since I can't find any documentation: http://bazaar.launchpad.net/~ubuntu-branches/ubuntu/precise/compizconfig-python/precise/view/head:/src/compizconfig.pyx\n", "Q: How do I remove an item from the Gnome-classic panel?

I want to install 12.04 on /dev/sda1 but since this partition has 31G allocated i want to resize it to 10G and create 2 more partitions from the remaining space. I want to know if by doing this will all my existing partitions get shifted and thereby i might have to reinstall them again or is it just a matter of reinstalling the grub on one of them (say Ubuntu) and add the remaining ones?\nAdditional information:\nI've sda1, sda5, sda6, sda7(swap), sda8, sda9, sda10, i plan to delete sda1 and recreate 3 partitions and have 12.04 installed in one of them, the existing ones might also get shifted, as a result grub on sda8 might not work so my machine would be completely unusable until grub is fixed.\nWill a resulting not optimal partition order cause any of the existing Linux OS's to not boot or is it just a bad partition table arrangement which won't really affect any OS in the disk?\nI had a bad experience last time around when disk numberings got rearranged and i had a tough time recovering everything. Don't remember what happened, so wanted to avoid any such issue this time.\nEdit: @Elijah/@Takkat - This is my first time using this website so didn't know i had to edit my original questions for additional information. I'll do that going forward. However i didn't find any delete option for two of my answers to remove them. Can you please remove those two answers? Thanks in advance.\n\nA: You will not lose any boot-loader information by creating new partitions from existing ones. The boot-loader path is installed on the very first part of your hard disk. This points to the actual location of grub. As long as you do not remove grub, you will not lose access to the \"installs\". \nThis becomes tricky when there is multiple hard drives with multiple pointers. I would make it a point to specify all of your installations to use the boot-loader path on a single hard drive. That way, only one grub boot-loader is ever used.\nBasically, hard drive \"A\" says --> grub is here on this disk. Grub says, here is the booting protocall for these installed OS's. Hard drive \"B\" may specify a different grub location or the same one. Keep it simple, use sda for all of your boot-loader needs.\n\nA: I repartitioned a disk recently in a way that caused the linux partition to change it's number (sda5 to sda3 or similar) and grub couldn't find it's files to boot.  I think it happened because I moved the linux partition data from an extended partition to a primary.\nBut anyway, it was easy enough to fix by booting off a live cd and updating grub to the right setup.  Nothing was lost.\n\nA: Since you have 6 partitions, you must be using extended partitions, since only 4 primary partitions are possible. You also mention that your existing OS is in `/dev/sda8', from which I can conclude that your list of partitions is probably:\n/dev/sda1 - primary - 31Gb as you say\n/dev/sda4 - extended partition - i.e. container for logical partitions\n/dev/sda5 - logical\n/dev/sda7 - logical\n/dev/sda8 - logical - root of Linux OS (you said)\n/dev/sda9 - logical\n/dev/sda10 - logical\n\nIf this set up is what you actually have, then you can delete or resize /dev/sda1 and then create 2 new primary partitions, /dev/sda2 and /dev/sda3 without the numbering or location of the other partitions changing.\nIn which case, your new partition scheme would be:\n/dev/sda1 - 10Gb\n/dev/sda2 - part of freed 21Gb\n/dev/sda3 - rest of freed 21Gb\n/dev/sda4 - extended partition - unaltered\n/dev/sda5 - logical - unaltered\n/dev/sda7 - logical - unaltered\n/dev/sda8 - logical - unaltered\n/dev/sda9 - logical - unaltered\n/dev/sda10 - logical - unaltered\n\nNote that, if your extended partition is /dev/sda2 instead of /dev/sda4 you can still make changes without affecting the numbering of /dev/sda5 and above. The only difference will be that the primary partition order may not be optimal, i.e. the start of your new /dev/sda3 and /dev/sda4 will be lower than the start of /dev/sda2.\n", "Q: Is there a way suspend 12.04 using a bash command while keeping the password prompt? I desire to suspend my Ubuntu 12.04 install with a bash script. The pm-suspend command will not prompt for a password when resumed.

I discovered if I print some documents then next document simply doesn't print with status processing or status pending. The only way is to disconnect printer from USB and immediately reconnect then works OK some times.\n\nA: In case it helps anyone, I have these same symptoms (print jobs go to pending and never print) unless my printer is turned on after Ubuntu starts up.

I selected \"photo paper\" in my print options (because I was using photo paper) and not only did the job get stuck in my queue, but my printer also started to make grinding noises and then began flashing its lights.\nSo I power-cycled the printer. Printed a test page using normal paper, just to make sure my printer wasn't fried, and ran:\nlprm\nsudo service cups restart\n\nand tried printing the checkerboard again with photo paper, and the same thing happened. Then I tried selecting \"normal paper\" from the options...and it printed perfectly.\nI guess the \"Print\" options shown my some applications doesn't always mess with the actual printer being used.\n", "Q: How to build Compiz from source?

Any ideas?\n\nA: Properly burning a .iso file to a disc doesn't place a .iso file on the disc. These files are bit-for-bit copies of the contents of a disc, including the filesystem structure. So what you will see is the files contained in the .iso image, rather than the .iso itself. This is similar to extracting a .zip file (or another archive) to a folder.\nTo create the Live USB drive, use the .iso file you burned to the CD. If you downloaded this file in Windows and are currently working from the Ubuntu Live CD, then you will need to find your Windows partition in the file browser (it should show up on the left side of the file browser window), and in that drive, navigate to Users/[your username]/Downloads (for Windows Vista/7) or Documents and Settings/[your username]/Downloads (for Windows XP) and you should find the .iso there.\n", "Q: Problems with Ubuntu and AMD A10-4655M APU I have a new HP Sleekbook 6z with AMD A10-4655M APU. I tried installing Ubuntu with wubi--the first attempt ended up with a 'AMD unsupported hardware' watermark that I wasn't able to remove (the appeared when I tried to update the drivers as Ubuntu suggested)\nOn the second attempted install Ubuntu installed (I stayed away from the suggested drivers) but the performance was extremely poor----as in Windows Vista poor. I am not sure what the solution is--if I need to wait until there is a kernel update with Ubuntu or if there are other solutions--I realise this is a new APU for the market.\nI would love to have Ubuntu 12.04 up and running--Windows 7 does very well with this new processor so Ubuntu should, well, be lightening speed.\n\nThe trial on the Sleekbook with Ubuntu 12.10 Alpha 2 release was a complete failure. I created a bootable USB. By using either the 'Try Ubuntu' or 'Install Ubuntu' options resulted in the usual purple Ubuntu splash screen, followed by nothing...as in a black screen without any hint of life. Interestingly one can hear the Ubuntu intro sound.\nIn case you are wondering, this same USB was trialed subsequently on another computer with and Intel Atom Processor. Worked flawlessly.\nLastly the second trial on the Sleekbook resulted in the same results as the first paragraph.\nPerhaps 12.10 Beta will overcome this issue, or the finalised 12.10 release in October. I don't have the expertise to know what the cause of the behaviour is-the issue could be something else entirely. Sadly, the Windows 7 performance is very good with this processor-very similar and in some instances better to the 2nd generation Intel i5 based computer I use at my workplace. Whatever the cause is for the performance with Ubuntu 12.04 or 12.10 Alpha 2, the situation doesn't bode well for Ubuntu.\nUbuntu aside, the HP Sleekbook is a good performer for the price. I am certain once the Ubuntu issue is worked on and solutions arise, the Ubuntu performance will probably be better than ever.\n\nA: Install the proprietary Catalyst drivers AMD website. (Ensure you chose Linux as the OS.) This will solve all display problems. \nYou can also install them from System - Additional Drivers. Your display chip will be detected and Ubuntu will let you download and install it.\nUPDATE (05-Nov-2012): I got a new laptop with an APU and I ran into the same problems. Here is how you can fix the problems.\n\n\n*\n\n*Download the latest 12.10 driver from AMD website.\n\n*Install the driver following the instructions given at the unofficial wiki at http://wiki.cchtml.com/index.php/Ubuntu\nIf you have a 64-bit system, you will need to install ia32 libs.\nIf the installation failed or did not work, then restart the computer with the failsafe version of the kernel at the Grub2 bootscreen menu. Press e to edit the failsafe option and then replace \"ro single\" with \"rw xforcevesa\"\nPress Ctrl+Alt+F2 to go to a TTY screen. Kill the desktop with\nsudo service gdm stop\nor \nsudo service lightdm stop\nRun the AMD driver with sudo sh\nChoose the second option of building the distribution-specific installer. (This will save you the trouble of uninstalling failed drivers.)\nIf the fglrx*.deb got created, install them as specified in the wiki.\nBefore you restart, run this command\nsudo /usr/bin/aticonfig --initial\nRun the command sudo reboot to restart the computer.\n\nA: My a10-4600m notebook works with the 12.10 beta 1 only if you press Shift while booting to load the Grub menu and then when when the boot with so and so kernel or safe mode and other options, press the e key and then where it says quiet boot erase that and enter nomodeset instead. \nThat will give you a ugly boot screen but at least the screen wont cut out after the purple bit. After that you can enjoy the broken version of Unity, hopefully they will have that fixed by the time you install it. \nI think the boot to black screen thing is a kernel thing because OpenSuse 12.8 Chakra 12.9 or anything with a kernel version from 3.4~3.5 wont boot without nomodeset. Maybe it will be fixed in a future kernel release.\n\nA: Support for AMD Trinity is built into Linux kernels 3.4 and above; Ubuntu 12.04 doesn't have it. You might want to try Ubuntu 12.10 Alpha 2. It includes the 3.5.0-2.2 Ubuntu kernel, which is based on the 3.5-rc4 upstream Linux kernel. (Alpha 3 will be released on Aug. 2; Beta 1 on Sept. 6).\nIf you do try this, please post here and let us know how well it works.

When you rename files with a different extension, most of the time it does not work. But, if you have a .png file, you can just rename image.png to image.jpeg or image.gif, and it automatically gets converted to the other format and works perfectly fine. Is there some similarity between these formats which allows this to be done? I noticed this a few years back, and got interested when I was trying to convert a .dvi file to a .pdf file; just renaming it worked!\n\nA: This is what probably happens. The application designated to open files with the file types you mention, is the same across all of those. .gif, .jpg, .png: these are all handled by EOG (GNOME's Eye Of Gnome). I suspect this application does not determine the file type based on the extension, rather it seeks for the magic number.\nNote that the behavior of EOG may very well be exceptional, and also beware that no actual conversion is done. It's just that Linux applications tend to rely on different detection methods than file extensions, though many modern desktops actually look for the file extension to determine what application to open, since this method is probably quicker.\nThis all may apply to Ubuntu, Windows is a completely different story. Explorer practices a behavior by default that cuts off the file extension from the filename. This way, a file named \"document.pdf\" will show as \"document\", and renaming it to \"document.dvi\" will actually be processed as \"document.dvi.pdf\". Viruses sometimes exploit this \"feature\" by making the user believe they are opening a .jpg, while in reality they are being tricked into running a malicious exe!\nTo be really sure about filetypes, there is a command called file that shows you detailed file information.\nFrom my personal experience, I can tell that, at least on my system, EOG cannot be tricked into recognizing a renamed image file. You must be doing something different than I do.\n\nA: Renaming .png files to .jpeg and .gif works because the program associated with and assigned to open those files is the same, and when it sees the extensions it can open, it simply opens them, because those are all image files and the program can open them.\nThe default program is EOG (Eye of Gnome) as another answerer says. Even if you remove the extension, it can still open them.\nAs for the dvi and pdf, again both file types are opened by the same program, which is called evince. So, the same thing happens there.\n\nA: On the command line, you can also use file to give some basic information about the file, e.g.\ncp test.png test.png.jpg\nfile test.png.jpg\n\nOutput:\ntest.png.jpg: PNG image data, 557 x 237, 8-bit/color RGB, non-interlaced\n\nSee the file manpage:\nman file\n\nYou can use convert (it's in the package imagemagick or rather imagemagick-6.q16) or some other tool to convert the file.\nconvert test.png test.jpg\nfile test.jpg \n\nOutput:\ntest.jpg: JPEG image data, JFIF standard 1.01, aspect ratio, density 1x1, segment length 16, baseline, precision 8, 557x237, components 3\n\nSome tools may not be affected by the \"wrong\" file extensions (because they ignore them) as explained in the accepted answer, but I would not rely on this to always work.\n\nTip: Using file you can create a simple script to search for files with the wrong file format.\n\nA: \nIs there some similarity between these formats which allows this to be done?\n\nAlthough some similarities exist between the two file formats, the main point is that the extension in the filename does not always represent the filetype its describing.\nIn Linux this is a given since you always specify the program you want to open your file with.\nYou can even check if there really is any difference between the two files comparing them using the GNU cmp utility together with the --verbose --bytes=100 options to limit and view the differing bytes. I also encourage you to display the header on your terminal through less to not overflow it, or even better, head -c 100 to only view the first 100 bytes to get a grasp of what cmp and your OS is actually reading. Neither in Ubuntu nor Windows I've been able to spot a difference. Using Paint on Windows to save a PNG to JPG format indeed changed the header from PNG to JFIF, and subsequently its contents.\nI'm personally more familiar with the Windows filesystem. The extension is there so the OS can identify faster the program it is associated with, and can be modified by the user by choosing default program when selecting \"Open with...\" on the context menu. You can also view all the extensions Windows recognizes from the programs it has installed by launching regedit and navigating to HKCR\\.txt to investigate how Windows perceives the \"txt\" file extension. I've personally used the Registry Editor to add the string Content Type with value text/plain to different extensions to be able to preview the text contents of a file on the Windows File Explorer's Preview Pane.\nPlease don't hate on me for talking about Windows. I just thought it was interesting to point out since many Windows users don't know the inner working of their Windows machine.\n", "Q: Error when trying to run TrueCrypt 7.1a x64 When I run TrueCrypt 7.1a x64 I get this error :\n1: /usr/bin/truecrypt: Syntax error: \")\" unexpected  \n\nHow to work around this error?\n\nA: I was getting the same error.

BACKGROUND: \nI have an ASUS laptop that has an AMD 64-bit processor, which also came with Window 7 pre-installed. Since I removed the original harddrive that came with it and installed a larger WD drive, I formatted it and installed Ubuntu 64-bit on it. I have upgraded many times and now have Ubuntu 64-bit 12.04 on it.\nPROBLEM: \nMy laptop had been running fine and fast. Then while it was powered on, but the lid closed, it got quite soaked when an angry cat decided to use it as a litterbox to piss on. As gross at it sounds, it is not nearly as gross as it smelled and was for me to personally deal with. At first it seemed to not hurt the laptop, but I unplugged it and carried it away quickly to deal with the mess, as well as that cat! GRRRR..\nThe laptop was already turned off, or lost its power before I looked at it to see about powering it off. I didn't want it to get shorted. I wanted it to be dried and cleaned before I would try to power it again. I did as much airing out as I could after taking out the battery and the components and cleaned them, drying them, the best I could. It seems the wetness got into the laptop and got under the keypad to my dismay.\nWhen 2 days later I tried to power it on, the light would turn on but the screen would not. It would not boot. I was upset, but didn't give up. Not until I tried removing the memory sticks and tested them one by one, did I think that using one stick would lead it to boot, but the o/s was slow and would not run any programs. I thought there must be damage. \n\nI NEED HELP WITH: After taking it to a \"PC DOCTOR\" who ended up saying the \"water (urine) damage\" caused me to lose my USB drives on the right, but everything else tested true, even the stick of memory that I couldn't get the laptop to boot with as long as it was in place. He said it was working and I took it home. However, it is very slow, crashing a lot, and it just locks up, freezes, sometimes for a minute, two, and I can't get anything to really do anything, other than using Terminal to go a run the upgrade and I installed about 120 upgrades without delay. I thought upgrading it as much as I could would repair the system,  but to no avail. (This was what the PC Doctor guy said it needed: he thought wrongly that I had not the latest upgrades for my new version of 12.04).\nI think perhaps the harddrive got wet or something shorted a connection, and maybe the memory is being written to wrongly. I had a problem like this before when I removed the orignal harddrive and replaced it with a new one when Windows 7 got issues from a fist on the keyboard. Maybe I need to reinstall Ubuntu 64-bit, or is there something I can run from the Terminal to repair Unity, or Ubuntu? I ran the memory-test at first from the boot screen when it said that: \n\nUbuntu was not shut down correctly\n\nand the memory tested fine. I ran in safe mode and tried to run repairs and upgrades and anything I thought could repair it. I ran into some Package Inheritance problems that I repaired, but all of this did not repair the system.\nRunning the system in safe mode and in Terminal seems to show that it runs quickly and without problems. It is just when in Unity that the system is and crashes. Hence my notion that it needs to be reinstalled/repaired somehow. Does this sound right? Since I cannot download Ubuntu 12.04 64-bit LTS or anything on my laptop I am now on a family member's Windows 7 computer typing this. I can download it hear and burn it to DVD. Would that be able to be made into a Live boot disc? I only see a CD image, but my family member only owns DVDs to burn.\nWhat able preserving my data when doing this? Would I need to download all the upgrades and packages and all else after doing this reinstallation? What else are my options? Run Ubuntu off my CD/DVD as a Live Disc? Anything else?\n\nA: DVD's are perfectly fine to burn ISO's to here is the full guide provided by Ubuntu, it says there that:\n\n\n*\n\n*''To install Ubuntu from a CD, you first need to burn the downloaded ISO image onto a CD or DVD.''- So regardless of what you have CD/DVD you'll be able to burn the image and run it off the Disc and there's nothing special to do with it being a DVD or not.\n\n\nAlso as an alternative if ever you're interested in doing it from a USB you can also check here.\nAs for preserving your data as will all re-installations and upgrades: Back up your data, external hard-drives have huge amounts of space and you can copy all your files and copy them back later. \nIf you download Ubuntu off the site you will have 12.04 but none of the applications you had before. There is a way to customise your live CD so that you have all the apps you had before as explained in this post about customisation of live CD's it's always nice to have a live CD with all your apps pre-installed, however if you're not planning on reinstalling more than once a year, it may not be worth the time seeing as new versions of Ubuntu will be released (or unless you stick to LTS releases) it's up to you to decide whether you feel like making one or not, as they do take some time. \nHaving said that if you have application data such as contacts/emails to import from Thunderbird for example, they are stored in your home folder so if you back-up your home folder you will be able to retrieve the exact configurations of your old thunderbird in your new install (it's a hidden file in there). So not everything will be from scratch and Ubuntu Software Centre is relatively quick for most apps, so the main issue would be the apps not there, installed via terminal. \nIf you need to compile a list of all the apps you've installed because you don't remember check out this post which lists all apps and packages installed, all you have to do is copy the list and save it somewhere.\nSo your main options: \n\n\n*\n\n*Fresh install from live CD (in your case DVD, works the same)\n\n*Fresh install from a USB\n\n*Some sort of repair (I tend to always re-install entirely so I can't give you any advice on this unfortunately)\n\n\nHopefully after this Unity won't be a problem anymore seeing as your hardware seems to be for the most part in perfect shape, however if your graphics card can't handle unity anymore, it may be that even though it works, it isn't running as smoothly as it should and you may have the same issue, although the only way of finding out (that I know of) is re-installing. \nSo to answer your question, yes you are right, the best option to know whether the hardware or software is causing the issue is a complete repair/re-installation. Unfortunately I've never heard of anything that can 'repair unity' though so unless someone else posts below I think re-installation is your best bet.\nHope this helps!\n", "Q: How to install openvpn on Lubuntu? I went the the connection manager, then clicked on the VPN tab, but the add button is disabled. What should I do? I cannot connected to the internet without the VPN turned on. I'm trying to install openvpn as a client. I already have the ca.crt and the client.conf with me and currently connected thanks to windows xp.\n\nA: The commented suggestion works.  Install network-manager-openvpn-gnome and its dependencies.  If you cannot connect to the internet without the vpn, you will have to get them from Ubuntu's repositories through another computer.  Start here http://packages.ubuntu.com/  Then select your version and search for the package by the above name.  When I installed it on Lubuntu 12.10, it required 4 other packages.  Make sure you download those as well, and install them first.  You can install the .deb files from a command line using (trying to run them from a file manager might work as well):\nsudo deb -i packagefile.deb\n\nIf you can find the dependency order of all of those packages, then install them in an order such that no package is installed before a package that it is dependent on.  This will make things much simpler.\n", "Q: How to stop Nautilus from using Home as Desktop Folder? As of a recent boot, my desktop folder is defaulting to ~/.

Will the entire Ubuntu software fit onto a single CD?\nIf  I download Ubuntu to a CD, for use on another computer, will it automatically install/partially install on the computer I use for the download? \nIf alternative measures must be taken to prevent installation on the \"host computer\", what steps must be taken, since I do have access, but do not have permission to download to the \"host computer\"?\n\nA: The installation disk, with the default selection of programs, will fit on a CD - largely because it's designed to do so. The desktop version is bootable and can be run independantly.\nUbuntu booted off a LiveCD does not do anything to the host system hard disk unless you ask it to by selecting the \"Install\" option.\nYou may want to make a LiveUSB instead - this will perform much better than a CD, and also provide the option of storing data persistently across sessions.\nFor more serious use, I install Ubuntu \"properly\" to an external hard drive, and direct the host computer to boot from that. This works well over both USB and eSATA interfaces. Some slight care must be taken when installing updates in this mode - I have known the bootloader, when it's updated, to be written over the bootloader on the host system.\n\nA: *\n\n*Yes, it will fit on a single CD. Download the ISO file and burn to a CD\n\n*No, a file is saved on the computer you use for the download. Nothing else, so there's no risk whatsoever that 'it' will do something to this computer.\n\n*No, no measures must be taken to prevent installing Ubuntu on the 'host' computer. Just insert the CD in the CD-drive, reboot the pc, make sure the BIOS is set to boot from CD before the HD. Then Ubuntu will run directly from the CD without affecting the 'host computer' in any way. You can try Ubuntu, see if it fits your needs, etc... If after that, you shut down your computer and remove the cd, next time it will boot from the HD and use what you have installed there. It will be as if nothing has happened.\nDo NOT use the option to 'install Ubuntu on your system' because that will install it on your computer, side-by-side with the original OS. But you will be warned before you do...\nHope this makes things a bit clearer...\n\nA: Lets approach this part by part.\n\nWill the entire Ubuntu software fit onto a single CD?\n\nThis depends upon how you define \"the entire Ubuntu software\".  Generally speaking, the software archive is over half a terabyte in size as of April 2013.  While there are tools to mirror portions of the archive, it is currently considered impractical to have it available in whole on a single disc.\nAs to the installation image for Ubuntu, it does not currently fit on a single CD.  The last release that can be located for example via the mirror in Portland shows the 12.04.3 release brushing dangerously close to the capacity limit for a CD.  Generally a DVD or USB key will be needed for installation use currently.\n\nIf I download Ubuntu to a CD, for use on another computer, will it automatically install/partially install on the computer I use for the download?\n\nNo.  Downloading the disc image does not trigger installation on the downloading computer.\n\nIf alternative measures must be taken to prevent installation on the 'host computer', what steps must be taken, since I do have access, but do not have permission to download to the 'host computer'?\n\nAs you've noted elsewhere in a comment that you do not have permission to save content to the computer, you may be best served by any of the following options: purchasing an installation disc from Canonical, locating a local Ubuntu social community that may be able to connect you with an installation disc, or consult third-party vendors such as on-disk.com and OSDisc.com\n\nA: All you need to do is download Ubuntu and burn a CD of the image you download. You can find more info on burning a CD on Ubuntu here.. In response to your other question, no the image you download has nothing to do with the computer you downloaded it to. The image is a standalone installer for Ubuntu.

Is there a package that contains a TeX to PDF converter/renderer available on Ubuntu 12.04?\nIf not, can you recommend a tool for me to download from elsewhere that can do this that is simple to install?\n\nA: At the command line, first install the texlive package if it isn't already installed:\nsudo apt-get install texlive\n\nThen use the pdflatex utility to convert the file like this:\npdftex /path/to/myfile.tex\n\nThe path /path/to/myfile.tex is, of course, an example path. You would put the path to your own file on your system.\nNotice that although the utility is called pdflatex you execute it with the command pdftex (without the la).\nThere are several settings that you can read about in the help for pdflatex:\npdflatex --help\n\nThe setting I use the most is the one to generate the pdf in a different directory:\npdflatex --output-directory=../otherdir /path/to/myfile.tex\n\nThe pdflatex utility is also interactive, so that if you forget to supply necessary information it will prompt you to enter it before converting the file.\n\nA: You should try rubber. It is a command-line tool to handle all the tasks associated with compiling TeX documents into pdf, dvi, etc.\n\nA: As far as I know, you won't find a single standalone binary that will do this for you. The typical utility is called pdflatex and is part of the TeX Live package. It's in the repositories, so simply opening the terminal and typing the below will install pdflatex and lots of other essential TeX stuff:\nsudo apt-get install texlive\n\n\nA: For Ubuntu 13.10 I suggest you use texlive-full.

Where can I get more information on this matter?\n\nA: At this point, no.  Not possible.  \nThere is a wiki here.  The issue is that at the very end of the first part of non-header text it states 'The below information is obsolete.'.  \nIf you click the link for up to date information, it directs you to the Ubuntu Support page, which seems to me to be about paid support, not training.\n\nA: It is actually called Ubuntu Certified Professional .\nThe initial Ubuntu Certification was Announced in 2006 jointly with  Linux Professional Institute (LPI) for Ubuntu certification exam  ,but later as Officially announced here in 2010\n\n\"We are really excited to support the Ubuntu 10.04 LTS release with a\nfresh course and certification programme,\" said Billy Cina, Director\nof Training at Canonical. \"Having delivered hundreds of courses over\nthe last four years, we listened to the requests from training\npartners and students for more Ubuntu-specific content. We have\nresponded and are confident that the change will benefit students\nglobally.

Now that the new\nLong Term Support version is nearing completion and release, Canonical\nhas decided to start its own certification programme and offers an\nonline pre-training assessment to determine if the programme is\nsuitable for the prospective candidate.\n\nThe test can be taken here provided you have an Launchpad account\nPre-training assessment: Ubuntu Professional\nAccording to this ,a bug was filed for missing Certification page , but the Training Exam page missing bug page doesn't exist any more .\nThe syllabus or contents covered in the course can be briefly seen here\n\nCurrent Scenario - No formal announcement regarding the present Course Activity Standing has been made yet , so contacting the respective\nTraining Team at #ubuntu-training on irc.freenode.net at the Training wiki Home page or through\nUbuntu-training-community mailing list for Official answer would be a feasible and appropriate  Idea.\n\nEDIT: Further at Ubuntu Advantage Knowledge they mention about training\n\nSkills training\nUbuntu Advantage offers training for systems administrators and end\nusers training so you can get the most out of your Ubuntu desktops and\nservers.

It's designed to cover all major Linux Distros, and very little outside the rpm section isn't useful on Ubuntu.  (The package questions include deb and rpm questions.)  It's a mostly a multiple choice test with some short answer.  Unlike the RHCE which is hands on.  Some people say the RHCE is better, but a lot of experinced admins find the LPIC tests harder.  In a hands on test you can use the man pages and don't need remember the exact command line options or the syntax of config file you edit a couple of times a year.\n", "Q: Source .profile using bash?

If you run the script, a new instance of bash is started to interpret the commands in the script. This new instance cannot alter its parent, thus any aliases that are set in the script, dies with the script.\n\nA: I'm way too late for this party but actually I was having exactly the same problem today. I came by to find a solution but what I found kept me thinking \"this can't be the workaround to this\".\nSo I went again to Terminator's options and the way I solved it was just by clicking a check-mark control inside the Terminator preferences.

I then executed the .run file and installed the program, which resulted in a folder appearing in my /Downloads folder containing the program and associated files.\nI ran the program a few times from that location but thought there must be a better place to store the files. I used the sudo mv command to the move the folder into /opt.  I later realised the program had been running while I did this but it didn't kick up any errors.  This was no problem, but when I searched the term 'Teamspeak' in the Dash it would still show the /Downloads folder instead of the /opt folder.\nSo the problem is simply that the Dash search hasn't updated the folder's location. The program runs fine from /opt so thats not an issue.\nAny assistance would be much appreciated :)\n\nA: As Ubuntu Says:\n\nThe Dash allows you to search for applications and files, showing you\n  applications and files that you have used recently. If you have ever\n  worked on a spreadsheet or edited an image and forgot where you saved\n  it, you will surely find this feature of the Dash to be useful.\n\nYou need to use the application from the new location for dash to remember it.\n", "Q: Satellite L640 Battery Applet Problem Hayy guy i got a satellite l640 and i installed ubuntu 12.04 on it and i dont get the battery percentage ive tried a fair bit but this is my first time using linux.\nIve gone into the power option and ive installed battery status apps and still i get nothing.\nThere was one saying how much amps and what not the battery has and it all has 0.00 for everything, ive also tried the terminal cammands to see the percentage and that doesnt work.\nIs there anything i can do or should i just got back to windows.\n\nA: Just passed by this post while searching for a similar issue with fan on my Toshiba Satellite L650.\nIf your problem has not been solved you can try this.

Unlike character devices, block devices will always allow the programmer to read or write a block of any size (including single characters/bytes) and any alignment.

There are application which can do this, but only change different pieces of the theme, such as colours, window colours, fonts etc.\nWhere can I get the application that 9.x used? It was so convenient. I am currently using Ubuntu 12.04 lightdm with lightdm greeter and gnome-classic metacity desktop.\n\nA: \nWhere can I get the application that 9.x used? It was so convenient\n\nNowhere, that application was used to and with  GTK 2 Themes, those themes used an XML like structure. GTK 3 was a big leap from that, it uses CSS making them different enough that porting a Theme is really making a new one. Thus Gnome Appearance is no longer of any used in Gnome 3.\nGranted that it was easier to change things like colors before it is not that hard now, if you want to change the colors of theme just open the file gtk.css located inside the Theme folder.\nYou will find colors are in hex, and the lines are pretty self explanatory so you know what you're changing.\nAlso installing theme snow isn't that hard, just drag n' drop the theme folder inside the hidden themes folder in your Home (.themes/).\n", "Q: How to backup and restore downloaded gnome-shell extensions?

I want to have a feature to backup those extensions and restore them  as required.\nHow can I do that?\n\nA: I guess I figured it out. You have to replace (after backuping, for safety) the following three folders with the original ones previously saved from the system you want to clone:\n~/.local/share/gnome-shell/extensions\n~/.local/share/gnome-shell/quicklaunch\n~/.config/dconf\nThen logout and login.\nLet me know if it works, or if you find better ways!\n(tested on Ubuntu Gnome Shell Remix 12.04)\n\nA: The downloaded gnome-shell extensions are stored in the .local/share/gnome-shell/extensions folder in your home directory folder. Copy the extensions folder and store them in somewhere else. \nWhen you need to restore those extensions, copy and paste the stored extensions folder in your .local/share/gnome-shell folder. Logout and Login.\n\nA: The easiest way so far is to use the chrome connector.\nAll you have to do is to right click the extensions, go to options and make sure \"Synchronize GNOME Shell extensions list\" is enabled. After you reinstall ubuntu you need to install this chrome extensions again and disable/re-enable this sync options. You will be prompted which extension list to use, remote or local and you can chose the remote list. \nOnly caveat i have found so far is that the extensions settings are not backed up too.\n\nA: gnome extensions are there : /usr/share/gnome-shell/extensions (sudo cp obviously)\nto reinstall you copy them back in .local/share/gnome-shell/extensions (you'll need to reactivate them in gnome tweak & then restart the session though)\n", "Q: Dual monitor gnome-shell broke itself Ok, lets get this over with.\nI have a dual-monitor, ati setup on gnome-shell that was just fine until this morning.\nThen, this happened.\n\nLook closer...\n\n\nWhatever has happened to my ubuntu setup?

I've had 12.04 installed on it for months with no problems until recently.\nNow, randomly occurring, my internal speakers will sometimes beging a routine of consistent (every 1.2 seconds or so) cracking/popping/clicking (no idea how to describe, it's kind of that sound you hear when your speakers go 'oh, I'm about to play some sound,' like a sound is TRYING to be played, but can't get out), even if the speaker volume is at 0 or muted entirely. Changing the sound volume does not change anything about this click noise.\nI've also noticed that about 90% of the time, this sound is a precursor to my trackpad simply stopping working (the computer itself still remains operative though, as about 99% of the time, I can still use the keyboard). If I plug in a USB mouse, it still works fine.\nIs there some sort of issue with my trackpad driver? I'm not sure what driver Ubuntu uses by default when detecting all of its hardware upon installation. Synaptic?\nAny help would be greatly appreciated; thanks!\n\nA: OP's question first:\nThe ticking is most probably caused by one of three factors:\n\n\n*\n\n*PulseAudio/Alsa problem, but muting should usually fix that\n\n*Driver/hardware problem, e.g. with the Realtek codec chip -- not fixable without further troubleshooting, may not even be fixable.\n\n*Electrical/RF interference issue, like the clicking you hear in unshielded speakers when a GSM cell phone is nearby and is transmitting/receiving -- this would be the most likely explanation considering that a touchpad failure always follows. Perhaps something wrong with the touchpad's USB or PS/2 connection, or its driver?\n\n\nYour (function)'s issue:\nSince you're sure this seems to be a Google Chrome issue, you should check by installing the pavucontrol package, starting Pulse Audio Volume Control and Chrome, and checking to see if you see sources like the below in the Playback tab, along with associated VU meter activity:\n\n\n\n*\n\n*If you see any, try with Chromium too and consider filing a bug.\n\n*If not, this may not be a Chrome issue and you may have problems similar to the OP's.\n\n\nA: There is a bug report on Launchpad, but nothing has been done!

Actually some other boards started and even Wikipedia has a different mind of Ubuntu, since Canonical took over.\nSo what US Corporation was it in the very beginning?\n\nA: I'm not quite sure what you're asking, as Mark Shuttleworth is the \"original investor\" and he is a person, not a US Corporation. (Also, Shuttleworth is South African--he is not from the United States.)\n\nA: Quite a lot of information and on the background on Ubuntu can be found on the respective pages:\n\n\n*\n\n*About Ubuntu\n\n*About Canonical\nThe idea and the spirit behind Ubuntu, and why this name was chosen can be read from there (without much we could add to this):\n\nUbuntu is an ancient African word meaning 'humanity to others'.

I followed the procedure, pressing the download button for Opera for Linux. If I \"Save to disk\", and then try to open the download, a window pops up that says \"INTERNAL ERROR - The file /home/Bob/Desktop/opera....\"etc.  Is Opera not compatible with Ubuntu 11.10?  It was with an earlier version of Ubuntu.  Is there a way around this?\n\nA: To install Opera in Ubuntu read below:\n\nThere are two basic types of installations, static and shared:\nStatic version: Opera has the Qt library built in. It is a larger\n  download, and it does not use antialiased fonts on menus or the file\n  chooser, and uses aliasing in the browser window and most other\n  interface elements.\nShared version: Opera uses the Qt installation on your system. It\n  integrates with the system, using whatever anti aliasing setting you\n  have for other Qt applications.\nThe shared version is probably better, as some of the resources it\n  uses (e.g., RAM for the Qt libraries) can be reused by other\n  applications. Try the other one if you run into installation or\n  operational problems.1 \n\nRead On\n1Source:Ubuntu Documentations\n", "Q: Merging two pictures Is there a tool in Ubuntu to automatically merge two images having a common strip? I need to scan a large image, which will not fit at once in the scanner. I was thinking about scanning it in two parts and hand-editing the result in Gimp to join them. But probably an automatic tool can do the same more quickly and better.\nEDIT I think I may have not made my point clear. My difficulty is not aligning two images. My problem is that one has to compensate for the rotation or distortion introduced by the manual process of putting the sheet into the scanner, and an automatic tool should obtain more precise results at analyzing common patterns in the two images to rotate and align them seamlessly.\n\nA: You can easily achieve that with Gimp.\n1)Make a new file File->New\n\nAt the \"create new image\" dialog add the desired height and width.That will give you your new file which may look like this (depending on the dimensions you set) :\n\n2)Open the two images you want to merge from File -> Open... \n3)Then click copy at the image Edit -> Copy...\n\n4)Go to the empty file you created first at step 1 and paste the images (Copy and paste the first image and then copy and paste the second) Edit -> Paste\n\n5)Position the two images using the \"Move\" option from the Toolbox\n\nWhen the pasted image is where you want it, set it in place. Either move your cursor on the canvas until you see a little anchor symbol, or click \"Layer\" on the Toolbar, then select \"Anchor\":\n\n6)Scale the new file with the two merged pictures Image -> Scale Image...\n\n\nA: I finally settled for Hugin. It requires some manual intervention, but has produced a really good result.\nHere is a tutorial that explains how to use Hugin so that it will not try to deform your flat images (the tool was born to produce panorama images from single pictures, hence it usually compensates for the perspective effects).\n\nA: Using the tools provided with ImageMagick\n\nWe can easily join, i.e. \"montage\" images into one large image with the following command\nmontage -geometry 500 image1 image2 [...] output\n\nSee the project page for many parameters of the geometry option. CAUTION: the output argument is non-optional, having just two images on argument list ends up replacing image2 without warning. In the example above all images will be scaled to a width of 500 pixels before they are joined. Adapt this value for your image sizes. In case you need to have a fixed height choose x500 instead. The other dimension will be scaled to preserve the aspect ratio.\n\nInspired by this post saying that ImageMagick has command line tool named convert to merge images. To join images horizontally (in alphabetical order):\nconvert +append *.png out.png \n\nTo stack images vertically:\nconvert -append *.png out.png\n\nThat should be run in a terminal into the folder containing png files to join them all.\nA gui for that would be:\na file manager context menu to join selected images.\nAn easy way when it comes to that is Thunar's custom actions:\nTo join selected images vertically (into one png file, in alphabetical order, no matter their extension) add this custom action:\nconvert -append %F joined-vertical.png\n\nTo join horizontally:\nconvert +append %F joined-horizontal.png\n\n\nFor a more sophisticated way to assemble images you may want to search for panorama photo  stitcher software such as hugin \n\nor the Pandora plugin for Gimp.\n\nA: I've successfully joined jpg's into panorama by using a program called fotoxx. It has a tool for just that purpose under the toolbar \"Combine\"\n", "Q: Unity bar doesn't hide After switching the 'auto hide' function on and off under behaviour in appearance settings, the Unity bar doesn't automatically hide anymore!

When trying to play a movie I purchased from Google Play, the movie player (same Flash-based one used by YouTube) spits out the following error message over a background of faux-TV-static:\n\nAn Error Occurred.

Sheesh. I Googled around for solutions, but I guess Google Play is too cutting edge for Ubuntu, because most of the solutions (in Ubuntu Forums, for example) recommended installing a Linux-specific Firefox plugin called Flash-Aid that essentially runs a configurable set of shell commands to ensure that you have the latest Flash from Adobe installed, and that you do not have any of the possibly conflicting free implementations of Flash installed (Gnash, etc). Suffice it to say, installing and running Flash-Aid did not help.\nAlso, I would add, I experienced the same error message trying to play the movie in Chromium.\n\nA: As of today, October 10th, 2013, using Google Chrome version 30.0.1599.66, I can watch pay Google Play movies using the HTML 5 player instead of Flash without problems.\nYou need to go to this link and enable HTML5 use in youtube.

I want to create a home build lens for the 12.04 dash and liked to use one of the default lenses as example. I'm thus for looking where I can find the files of these lenses.\n\nA: There are three essential files that compose a lens.\n\n\n*\n\n*A .lens file stored in /usr/share/unity/lenses. This details the name, icon, and D-Bus address of a lens for Unity.\n\n*A .service file stored in /usr/share/dbus-1/services. This points to the location of a lens' query executable; D-Bus will see this executable and act as IPC between it and Unity.\n\n*Finally, the executable of your lens may be placed anywhere in the filesystem (you specify where in the .service file), but canonically these are located in /usr/lib.\nLook at /usr/share/unity/lenses/video/video.lens, /usr/share/dbus-1/services/unity-lens-video.service, and /usr/lib/unity-lens-video/unity-lens-video for a concrete example of how these files work together.\n", "Q: How long can file names be? How long can be files names and folder names in Ubuntu Linux and what characters are allowed in file name and folder name in Ubuntu Linux?\n\nA: I'm not sure what the maximum file name length can be (for ext4), but it's more dependent on the file system, than Linux itself. On FAT32, I think it is 255 characters. You probably don't ever actually need a file name that long.\nAs for characters allowed, any byte value is allowed on the ext4 file system, except for the NULL byte (and /, as that is the directory separator1). However, you should limit your file names to the UTF-8 character set, for the widest range of compatibility across applications, and devices.\n1. As stated in the glibc manual, \"any character except the null character is permitted in a file name string,\" but a / in the file name string separates the name of one file or folder from that of its parent.\n\nA: File names in Linux were 14 bytes long in earlier Unix version. But The modern Linux system has 255 bytes for file names. \nAs a character requires 1 byte, The length becomes 255 characters. Also the folders are treated as files in Linux system\nSee this link for more information\n", "Q: Autostart in .xinitrc I want to run some program at awesomewm startup.

The desktop entry should have the following lines\n  [Desktop Entry]\n  Name=script.sh\n  Exec=/home/mike/script.sh\n  Type=Application\n  Terminal=false\n\nAnother way is by using the rc.local file:\nYou usually add the complete path of your script to the rc.local file at /etc/rc.local; rc.local is executed only after everything else has started up, and must be made executable (sudo chmod +x), if it isn't already. (Sudo is necessary as the script is owned by root, and that is why some may see it as a security issue for root to start a users's script, but for home desktop users it is reasonable to use the rc.local method.) \nHowever, make sure that you leave the exit 0 as the last line of the rc.local script: for example, my rc.local file contains the location of a script and two other commands.\nIf you want to make sure your script is run by /bin/sh or /bin/bash, put that in front of the path; e.g. /bin/bash /home/mike/script. \nFinally, use either sudo vi /etc/rc.local or gksudo gedit /etc/rc.local to edit the file.\n#!/bin/sh -e\n#\n# rc.local\n#\n# This script is executed at the end of each multiuser runlevel.\n# Make sure that the script will \"exit 0\" on success or any other\n# value on error.\n#\n# In order to enable or disable this script just change the execution\n# bits.\n#\n# By default this script does nothing\n# my script here\n/bin/bash /home/mike/bin/script\nexit 0\n\n\nA: Here is the simplest way i've been adding autostart programs in LXDE environment.\n\n\n*\n\n*make 'the.sh' to execute the program you want and save it to /home/user/.config/autostart/the.sh (remember tomake it executeable)\n\n*now add to the /home/user/.config/lxsession/LXDE/autostart file a line \n@sh /home/user/.config/autostart/the.sh and restart the computer.\nthats it.\n\n\nNB! some programs need to be delayed at startup so for an example the 'conky.sh' must be \n#!/bin/sh\n\nsleep 3\nconky\n\n--so maybe the first way you tried to autostart 'touchpad_settings.sh' just needs a delay in .sh file.\n\nA: You just used a wrong path in /etc/xdg/lxsession/Lubuntu/autostart:\nIn the line: \n@home/magpie/touchpad_settings.sh \n\nthe @ will be removed, and the rest executed as a shell command.\nIt uses a relative path:\nhome/magpie/touchpad_settings.sh \n\nSo if the current working directory is /home/magpie, the script it runs is /home/magpie/home/magpie/touchpad_settings.sh\nAdd a / to fix it, and make sure the script has the execute permission:\n@/home/magpie/touchpad_settings.sh\n\n(The @ means it will get restarted if it exits.)\n", "Q: Ubuntu Crashed, Now, how to load kernel in GNU GRUB? \nPossible Duplicate:\nIn GNU GRUB, I receive error: no loaded kernel.

I don't think so  - I am using the latest (?) version 14.0.1.\nDoes anyone have any clue how to get to the bottom of this?\n\nA: I'm interpreting this as a question about how to effectively report and investigate such a bug, since actually working on bugs in generally off-topic for Ask Ubuntu (and bug reports are always off topic here).\nThe best thing to do is to:\n\n\n*\n\n*Learn how to search for, and how to report, bugs in Ubuntu.\n\n*Make sure Apport is enabled.\n\n*Reconfigure Apport to submit data to Launchpad for a bug report instead of submitting it for anonymous statistical analysis (since you're running 12.04).\n\n\n*\n\n*You may want to undo this afterwards, if you don't want to file bug reports most of the time something crashes.\n\n\n*Reproduce the crash by running Firefox, starting a Terminal, and using it.\n\n*Let Apport submit crash data.\n\n\n*\n\n*If Apport doesn't come up automatically, this might not really be a crash. It mgiht be some other kind of problem. (Sometimes a program quits, and it shouldn't have, but it's not a crash.)

When you install a program like postgresql, it installs several programs for its last version.\nOnce installed how remove all those packages? because using\napt-get remove postgresql\n\nremoves only that head package\n\nA: As apt-get autoremove (suggested by Aaron) will remove all \"helper-packages\" nothing seems to depend on any longer, sometimes you want to keep some of them for one reason or another. So if that concerns you, another possibility would be:\n$(apt-cache depends postgresql|awk '{print \"sudo apt-get remove \"$NF}')\n\nUsing Bash as your shell, this would basically do the following:\n\n\n*\n\n*apt-cache depends postgresql would list all packages the postgresql depends on, including postgresql itself. But each line would look like depends on: <package> -- so we pipe the output to...\n\n*awk '{print \"sudo apt-get remove \"$NF}' which would take the last word on each line (which is the package name), and prints it out after preceding it with our intended command: sudo apt-get remove (you could of course also use apt-get purge instead).\n\n*finally, using the $() construct, we advise Bash to interpret the output as command to be executed.\n\n\nYou could alternatively replace the 3rd step and instead redirect the output into a file:\napt-cache depends postgresql|awk '{print \"sudo apt-get remove \"$NF}' >pg_remove.sh\n\nAnd then inspect the file, optionally do some adjustments (such as commenting out/removing lines where you want to keep a package), and finally execute the script using\nbash pg_remove.sh\n\nNow you have a lot of possibilities to chose from :)\nEDIT: Checking with more complex metapackages as e.g. lubuntu-desktop, above statements needs to be refined:\napt-cache depends <packageName>|grep \"Depends on\"|awk '{print \"sudo apt-get remove \"$NF}'\n\nThe grep is needed to restrict the result to dependencies (and skip the recommends etc.).\nIMPORTANT: You should use this only for metapackages!!! otherwise, you may end up with an empty disk (e.g. postgresql-9.1 depends on libc6, and removing libc6 will certainly backfire as it is needed by a lot of packages). \nSo be careful, and better redirect to a file first (as explained) and investigate before execution.\n\nA: HIt Alt+Ctrl+T and run:\nsudo apt-get autoremove\n\nThis command removes packages that are no longer needed, which is due to removing a package (such as postgresql) that depends on them.\nYou can always purge the configuration files with:\nsudo apt-get autoremove --purge\n\nTo clean even further, use the following:\nsudo apt-get install deborphan sudo apt-get autoremove --purge\ndeborphan\n\n\nA: Simple follow the following commands :\nsudo apt-get install deborphan\nsudo apt-get autoremove --purge postgresql\nsudo apt-get autoremove --purge `deborphan`\n\n", "Q: How to know version of program in meta-package? How to know the version of a set of program to be installed through a meta-package?\n\nA: If you're contemplating installing a metapackage and you want to know what all the packages are that will be installed as a consequence, and all their versions, one of the best ways to find this out is to simulate installing the metapackage.\nFirst, update information about what packages and versions are available. (You should do this before installing most packages, especially metapackages that may pull in a lot of other packages. So you may as well do it before your simulation, so the simulation reveals the correct information.)\nsudo apt-get update\n\nThen run the simulation. For example, suppose you're contemplating installing the kubuntu-desktop metapackage:\napt-get -s install kubuntu-desktop\nReplace kubuntu-desktop with the name of the metapackage you want to install. (This  actually works for any package available from any configured software source, and you can list multiple packages, separated by spaces, too.)\nIt looks like this (though yours will be different, in part because you have different packages already installed).\n\nA: Usually, you can find out the version number of a program by typing\nprogram -v\n\nor something along those lines in a terminal, or by going to Help > About if it has a GUI.\n", "Q: How can I disable my webcam?

Is Gnome contacts using my old Evolution address book? I would like to configure it, but I cannot even find a menu.\n\nA: You are experiencing an almost universal problem with Google Contacts.  It appears that Google stores contacts in a database and duplicates the contact whenever it is changed and marks the old version of the contact so that it is not shown on the website.

I do\nhave a windows recovery partition on disk, but it\nseems this one is not accessible by virtualbox.\nHow do I install Windows 7 64-bit inside Ubuntu?\n\nA: The only safe way to install Windows 7 in Virtual Box is to use an installation CD (or a CD image).\nDepending on your licence it may allow you to use the Windows licence from your PC for the virtual machine, provided you do not have installed Windows outside the virtual machine. If you have such a license you will be able to install Windows from any other installation CD. You will not need the physical data from your recovery partition.\nAs in theory it is possible to bind a hard drive as raw disk to Virtual Box (see the Virtual Box manual on how to do this) this may not be a good idea when it comes to data security. In addition to that it is very doubtful that if you booted your recovery partition or recovery CD it will install anywhere else but the machine it was built for.\n", "Q: Is there a way to use Tor system-wide? Almost everything is blocked where I am and I need to use a transparent proxy to access anything.

So when you want to use it in proxy settings, you need to ensure that you're using correct proxy (http or socks). And check the port before use it.\nSo Check your tor settings and set proxy accordingly.\nYou can also use proxy softwares like FreeCap.\n\nA: As @Izzy mentions, the Tor project itself gives directions on how to do what are known as \"transparent proxies,\" though they highly discourage the practice due to packet leaks.  The alternative are \"isolating proxies\" that allow you to lock down your network to insure all packets go through Tor.  For more on how to do it if you really want to, you might want to have a look at my answer to a related question.  The TorProject.Org approach is thick with IPTables, but there are others.  I also mention isolating alternatives there.\n", "Q: How can I expand a partition into non adjacent unallocated space? Here the deal: I have Ubuntu 12.04 and Windows 7 both install in separate partitions in the following partition configuration:\n\n\n*\n\n*Windows\n\n*Ubuntu\n\n*Swap\n\n\nI decided that I wanted to move 50gbs from Linux to Windows, so I shrunk the Ubuntu partition with GParted. Now it's like this:\n\n\n*\n\n*Windows\n\n*Ubuntu\n\n*50gbs unallocated space\n\n*Swap\n\n\nNow, I tried moving the Ubuntu partition to the right so that I could expand the Windows one, but GParted warned me that moving it could make Linux unbootable. Is there any way to do this without breaking my OS? Thanks a lot.\n\nA: This depends on whether you installed Ubuntu to an extended partition, or if it's on a primary partition.\n\n\n*\n\n*If primary, Ubuntu shouldn't break inspite of the warning. \n\n*If extended, Ubuntu will break (or more accurately, its bootloader GRUB will)\n\n*\n\n*To fix this, you will need to boot from a LiveCD/LiveUSB and run sudo update-grub (you could possibly do this after GParted finishes, if you're already booted from a LiveCD)\n\n\n\nA: *\n\n*In your case, first you have to shrink 50gb from the left from\nyour Ubuntu partition. This would probably break the bootloader, but\nno worries.\n\n*Then extend the Windows partition with that unallocated 50gb space.\n\n*Boot into a Ubuntu LiveCD/LiveUSB and reinstall the bootloader. \nIt's just a matter of slapping few commands on the terminal.\n\nA: Like GParted said moving it could make Linux unbootable, mostly what Gparted said is going to happen if you move your linux to right and you will have hard time repairing it. It will take same amount of time as a fresh install.\nYou should better go with fresh install (remember to backup the data).\n", "Q: What partition settings should I use when setting up a new hard drive? \nPossible Duplicate:\nWhat's your recommendation on drive partitioning schemes for a desktop and home server? \n\nI partitioned my drive in three parts. Ubuntu 12.04 options are /, boot, usr, ext2, ext3, ext4, swap, etc. The program would only accept \"/\" for the first partition. What settings, and why, should I use for partitions 2, 3 or 4? \n\nA: First, you must distinguish between partitions (in your example: / and /boot), and file systems. What partitions one uses often very much depends. I'd always recommend placing /home on a separate partition: This way you can even re-format everything else, but still keep all your user data and settings. Also, swap should go to its own partition (not much alternatives but using swap files, which is not that performant). Everything else is quite optional.\nSo depending on your disk size, partiotioning might look a bit different. Assuming at least a 500GB disk, my recommendation would be as follows:\n\n\n*\n\n*/ with 20..40GB on ext4, primary partition\n\n*swap with (depends*) GB, primary partition\n\n*extended partition with the remaining space**\n\n*/home using the remaining space in the extended partition (as logical partition), ext4\n\n\n*) Swap: Many different opinions here. I hold that with disk sizes today, it cannot hurt still reserving the size of RAM (or a bit more) for swap, just in case. I'd give it 5..10GB.\n**) using an extended partition here gives you more freedom to change things later, resizing this partition, splitting it to allow for some more. Primary partitions are restricted to 4 per disk -- but you can have as many logical partitions as you like. Well, almost...\n", "Q: Not enough swap: hibernation not working in 12.04?

Therefore, your swap partition should be at least as big as your RAM size. For more information Click me\nAnd for your second question, you should use GParted , like arhimed has mentioned, to increase the swap size to an appropriate one!

The methods should be the same, except that for windows, you need to make sure you install windows first.\nThe second Linux distro to be installed will usually detect the existing one, and create a Grub menu for both.\nHowever, the second one will assume it is the main OS, and will setup Grub to look for the configuration file in its own partition, in /boot/grub.\nOne problem here may be that BackTrack appears to be based on Ubuntu, and perhaps you accidentally performed an upgrade rather than a new install.  You should create a new partition, and make sure you install it alongside the existing OS.  I usually create the partition first in gparted (actually, I already have some spare partitions for experimenting), then choose \"Something Else\" from the install menu.\nMy Setup\nI have a 1 TB drive, plus a second 500 GB drive, so disk space is not at a premium for me.  I back up to the alternate drive, and also have an old Windows XP on it.\nMy main drive is partitioned as a single extended partition, no primary partitions at all. I created 3 or 4 20 GB partitions for my main and alternate Linux installs, some swap space, a bit of unused space for various things I've tried (such as /boot partition, /var, etc), and the rest - at the end of the partition - is a \"shared\" partition with audio, video, photos, documents, etc.  I create symbolic links to this in various distros I use so I always have access to my personal stuff.  I keep the home directory with the distro, and it has a lot of distro-dependent settings.\nI mount the \"shared\" partition in any installation that needs it, using /etc/fstab to mount the partition into /mnt/shared.  The shared partition contains directories such as \"Documents\", \"Music\", \"Pictures\", etc, and I create links to these directories in my home directory.  The easy way to do this is to use Nautilus, highlight a directory, right-click and choose \"Make a Link\".  For example, I do this for /mnt/shared/documents, and Nautilus creates a link named \"Link to documents\".  I cut and paste this link into my home directory, and if there are any files int ~/Documents, I move them to /mnt/shared/documents.  I then delete Documents in my home directory, and rename \"Link to documents\" to \"Documents\".  If this is done without logging out, the link will inherit the special icon and will act just like the original.\nRepeat this procedure for any other directories, like music, pictures, etc.\nWhen I want to try out a version upgrade, I can copy my current version to a partition so I can go back to it, then I can upgrade without worry, and I always have my data available.  It's very easy to copy anything I need from my home directory on a different distro, such as .bashrc, etc.\nThe only thing to be aware of is the grub configuration.  I've accidentally deleted a partition that has the grub files, and this makes the system temporarily unbootable unless you know the drill to boot from the grub prompt - not really hard, but I usually need a guide to remember.  But the best thing is to have a bootable rescue CD, such as the Super Grub Disk, which can fix these problems easily.\n", "Q: Why can I only run Hamster Time Tracker as root?

I found this Lubi installer (Linux Ubuntu Installer) which is similar to Wubi, except it allows to install any of Ubuntu derivatives and do it from Linux and not Windows. It is exactly what I needed, installing Ubuntu without having to burn to USB stick, mess again with the partitions, I have the iso downloaded already, it would be just install and run, really useful. \nI've tried already to proceed as described here, however, even though all process was easy to follow and appeared to have been successfully executed, when I reboot PC, there isn't Ubuntu option to boot from in the Grub Menu.\nThen I checked the requirements and it states that Lubi will not work on any systems using LVM, EVMS, or another logical volume manager, or filesystems other than ext2, ext3, reiserfs, vfat, ntfs, jfs, or xfs.\nMy home partition default filesystem is ext4, which is not listed in here. This may possibly be the reason why it doesn't work. Is there anyway to make Lubi work on ext4 filesystem? I've been on this thread already and some other people have this issue as well, but there is no activity in there for over an year and no further updates about this.\n\nA: Unfortunately, LUBI does not appear to have been updated since the days of Ubuntu 7.04. \nWhile there is no technical reason ext4 wouldn't work with Lubi's methodology (loop-mounted filesystem), gettIng Lubi to do that would require updating it or would require editing of config-files on both the \"host/guest\" of a Lubi install. \nAssuming Lubi even supports the current GRUB2 in the first place, your best option may be to use gparted and carve out a separate ext3 partition just for Lubi filesystems. \n", "Q: Recording audio: What is the best volume setting? follow-up question:\nWhat can be considered too high or too low volume?\n\nI've been using Ubuntu to record some screencasts (kinda. Khan-style lectures, really)\nI want to know what volume setting I should use for the microphone for optimal results. \nI am guessing that \"base\" (in pavucontrol) or \"unamplified\" (in the ubuntu volume control), and increasing the volume later in ffmpeg would be optimal for quality (as compared to just using a higher setting).\nIs that true?\nBonus points: are \"base\" and \"unamplified\" the same? What does the \"100%\" setting in ubuntu volume control mean, given that it is different than \"unamplified\"?\n\nA: When recording, especially to digital formats like this, it is important to monitor the recording levels, whether from a microphone or line input or whatever, and ensure they do not clip.  Most recording apps have a level meter that clearly indicates the max level you should allow. By adjusting to meet this level, you will be able to determine whether it needs to be amplified or not.\nThe other thing is to not have the level too low.  This allows background noise/hum/etc to increase in your recording.  It also wastes some of the resolution of the audio capture device (the analog to digital conversion).  This is why you should avoid having to increase the volume level later in ffmpeg or whatever processing you do.\nSo, set it to be close, but NOT exceeding the max level before clipping.\n\nA: The best setting really depends on your microphone. Unamplified means that the signal from the microphone is caputered without any amplification by the audio card. 100% means full amplification. Everything above is overdrive. You should avoid that. Experiment a little with settings from unamplified to 100%. One in that range should suit you. Listen to your recording and see if you can be understood easily and only little unwanted backround noises are hearable.\nPS: I have no idea what 'base' is ;-)\n", "Q: Where can I get Ubuntu templates/themes for Joomla or Wordpress? May you suggest me how to recreate/build a template/theme similar to askubuntu for a Joomla/Wordpress web site please? \n\nA: The community maintains Ubuntu themes for some web frameworks. You can find themes for Wordpress, Drupal, and Django here:\n\n\n*\n\n*https://launchpad.net/ubuntu-community-webthemes\nBut there does not appear to be a Joomla theme. \n", "Q: Setting up private nameservers I am wanting to setup private nameservers; \nlike ns1.domain.com & ns2.domain.com \nand I am wanting to make my ubuntu server to point these nameservers to this machine.\nSo now to manage DNS for a domain like somedomain.com I can point that domain to ns1.domain.com and ns2.domain.com\nI have been looking into something like bind9; but I am not sure how I can get started with setting up private nameservers or is it something which I need to purchase from some where to register those as nameservers?\nAny help would be greatly appreciated.\nThanks!\n\nA: You can set up a nameserver for use on a LAN and you can configure it to resolve names any way you like. But if you want computers on the Internet to be able to reach your machines by domain name then you will have to pay money to register that domain name with a domain name registrar.\n", "Q: Which one is the Windows Partition I want to delete in this GParted screenshot? Basically I just got Ubuntu yesterday as a DualBoot.\nI am trying to delete Windows Vista now.\nI would have just got the USB install and just replaced Ubuntu with Windows but I kept getting errors.\nI am following this guys instructions to delete Windows:\nHow to uninstall Windows from a Dual Boot system?\nSo I am at GParted,\nand he says to delete the Windows Partition.\nI have a feeling the 2nd one is the Windows Partition, but it's locked.\nHere's the first picture:\n\nThe second Partition I can't delete, it is just gray over the delete button.\nPlease help me delete Windows!\n\nA: Be very sure you are not using Wubi (installed Ubuntu from Windows) since your NTFS partition is called /host!!\n*And that you are on a Live-CD/USB!*\nBoth partitions are NTFS; the first one is a \"diagnostic\" partition from Toshiba, the second one is Windows. You may have to right-click and Unmount the partition in gray before GParted will let you delete it; if there is no Unmount option or you try unmounting and it fails, you are probably using Wubi!\n\nA: The second one is indeed your Windows partition. You will have to unmount this partition first by right-clicking and choosing \"Unmount\".\nBesides, you should definitely take a look at \"Disk Utility\". It suits basic partitioning needs, has benchmarking, can deal with S.M.A.R.T info, RAID and LVM setups, and more. It's installed by default.\nEdit: it seems like you are running a Wubi install, since your Windows partition is mounted on /host. In this case, the information above is irrelevant and you will have to reinstall Ubuntu \"the real way\" in order to achieve what you want.\nThis can be done by booting your computer from the Ubuntu live cd/usb.\n\nA: As I see your primary partition is /dev/sda2 with the ntfs filesystem and your system is booting on this partition , probably it's  \"windows\" that you're looking for.\nAlthough /dev/sda1 is a partition for diagnostics or recovery but there is no mount point on.\nTo delete a partition : \ntry to login as sudo and launch \"cfdisk\" to manage your partitions , then unmount your mount point on your last partition . \n\nA: As you don't have an ext2/3/4 partition - your Ubuntu installation is a Wubi installation which uses a virtual disk.\nIf you want a completely native Ubuntu installation you need a separate partition on disk for Ubuntu.\n\n\n*\n\n*Unistall Ubuntu Wubi installation.\n\n*Use Vista to optimize disk space (so files are moved towards start of disk).\n\n*Use GParted from live DVD/USB to shrink existing Vista partition and create free space for Ubuntu installation.\n\n*Install Ubuntu to hard disk using the free space on disk. (Ubuntu will create one ext4 partition and a swap partition).\n\n\nAfter Ubuntu is installed you will have a dual-boot Vista - Ubuntu.\nUsing GParted you can delete Vista partition and then update grub configuration so you end up in a single boot for Ubuntu.\nYou can keep \"TOSHIBA SYSTEM VOLUME\" or delete it (it contains maybe some recovery tools but it does not contain full recovery of Vista as only ~500 MB are used).\n", "Q: How to fix black screen whenever a game starts? When I launch Minecraft, I log in, it updates, and then the screen turns black.\nWhen I launch Counter-Strike, it launches, shows the Valve screen, and then the screen turns black.\nI'm really pissed off because ive been trying non stop for two days looking through a bunch of bullshit that doesn't work. I'm on Ubuntu 12.04. I tried finding my Intel HD graphics family driver for Linux but Acer doesn't provide one. How might I fix this problem?\n\nA: I know about Minecraft, but not Counter Strike, sorry. Download the minecraft.jar from here. Put it on your Desktop. Right click and make a new document called \"minecraft\". Inside it, type this:\n#!/bin/sh\n\njava -Xms512M -Xmx512M -jar minecraft.jar nogui\n\nOpen your Terminal and do these following commands:\ncd ~\ncd Desktop\nchmod a+x minecraft\n\nThe file called \"minecraft\" should be an executable, and open it up. Run it, and you should be able to play.\n\nA: Minecraft:\nI know this is an old question but I had have a quite similar problem with minecraft.\nThe screen when it loads the files needed for minecraft appeared but after this there was only black.\nI used suns java-7-jre.\nUsing the java-6-jre for playing minecraft fixed it for me.\nCounter Strike:\nI asume that you are using wine to play it. If you start it via steam you might add \"-dxlevel 70\" to the startoptions of CS(S).\nThis might help others.\n\nA: I think you are misunderstanding certain things. First, Counter Strike is not an Ubuntu application, instead it must be run through Wine, which is guarantee whatsoever that it will run. You can consult http://appdb.winehq.org for specific information, test results and how-tos that are relevant for your application.\nSecondly, there is no need to look for graphics drivers, since Ubuntu already includes them, as they are part of the Linux kernel. The current state is as good as it gets.\nComing to a conclusion: What exactly is your question?\n", "Q: Create fillable or editable fields in a PDF I wonder how to create fillable forms in a PDF, such as this one. I would like to fill out the places that are required to fill out.\n\nA: Download and install Master PDF Editor from here, e.g. the 64-bit version with QT 4.6\ncd; wget http://get.code-industry.net/public/master-pdf-editor-3.5.81_amd64.deb\nsudo dpkg -i master-pdf-editor-3.5.81_amd64.deb\nsudo apt-get install libqt4-svg\n\n\n\n*\n\n*Create new PDF or edit existing ones.\n\n*Add and/or edit bookmarks in PDF files.\n\n*Fast and simple PDF forms fill out.\n\n*Changing font attributes (size, family, color etc).\n\n*Encrypt and/or protect PDF files using 128 bit encryption.\n\n*Convert XPS files into PDF.\n\n*JavaScript support.\n\n*Dynamic XFA form support.\n\n*Validation Forms and Calculate Values.\n\n*Add PDF controls (like buttons, checkboxes, lists, etc.) into your PDFs.\n\n*Import/export PDF pages into common graphical formats including BMP, JPG, PNG, and TIFF.\n\n*Signing PDF documents with digital signature, signatures creation and validation.\n\n*Free PDF Editor on Linux (for non-commercial use)\n\n\n\n\nA: I believe OpenOffice Writer can create fillable PDFs, though it may be lacking some features that you may be looking for such as emailing the output.  \nThe basics are:\n\n\n*\n\n*Create a new OO Writer document\n\n*Enable the Forms toolbar: View → Toolbars → Form Controls\n\n*Create your form\n\n*Export as a PDF\n\n\nHere's a detailed tutorial:\nhttp://openoffice.blogs.com/forms_fromscratch.pdf\nIn order to add form fields to an existing PDF, you can install the pdf importer extension for OO writer:\nsudo apt-get install libreoffice-pdfimport\n\nI just tested that and it works fine with LibreOffice 3.\n\nA: By far the simplest way to do this is with Xournal. You type or draw in a layer above the PDF, then export the PDF + your layer as a new PDF. It looks very neat and it is easy to use. Here is a screen shot of the UI with a simple line of text added to your example PDF.  \n\n\nA: You can try to OCR the scanned image to convert it to editable text - but that often involves a bit of correction later to fix the mistakes, especially with forms.  As discussed in comments below, use the form controls in Libreoffice to add fields to the form if you want to generate a pdf form that can be filled out.\nor, what I think I would do, - you could just edit the image (cut'n'paste from the PDF) in a paint/drawing program (maybe LibreOffice Draw?) and insert text at the appropriate points.  LibreOffice can convert it back to a PDF as well, as a bonus.\n\nA: You can create PDF forms with OpenOffice Writer that users can fill-in with a simple PDF viewer. You use form controls (View - Toolbars - \"Form Controls\") and insert fields. There is several steps in the process. How-to do it guide:\nhttp://foersom.org/HowTo/OoCreatePdfForm.html\n\nA: So far, for me, all pdf for linux are buggy and unstable.  An easy way to overlay info is to:\n\n\n*\n\n*Use GIMP to import pdf and save pdf as an image (e.g. tiff)\n\n*Use that image as a watermark in LibreOffice Writer\n\n*Use keyboard to simply type onto the page where you need\n\n*Save as odt and pdf files\n\n\nSimple, quick.\n\nA: You can create fillable forms with LaTex, using the hyperref or the eforms packages.  See examples in answers to Creating fillable PDFs on SE:TeX.\n\nA: You can try: uPdf\nYou can add blank pages, or pages from other documents or insert images or text.\nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:atareao/updf\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get install updf\n\n\nA: I happened to come across this website for software, called PDFfiller when I was looking for a perfect way to edit PDF files. I would really recommend this, no software to download and install. You can fill the text fields, add a variety of checkmarks, digitally sign the form and even add pictures. After your pdf form is completed, it can be printed, emailed, faxed or saved on your computer. You can even send fillable pdf forms to your customers, employees, vendors and partners. Also you can find the right fillable form anytime using the form search engine that contains more than 10 Million forms.\n\nA: I think that the best tool for this is Foxit Reader. It can be installed in Ubuntu and it has a Type option to fill PDFs. \n\n\nA: PDF Studio 9 has an interactive form designer to add text fields, check boxes, radio buttons, list or signature fields to PDF documents. JavaScript formatting and calculations are supported. \nIf you are only interested in filling data into existing interactive forms, our software PDF Studio can also do that and save the forms. It supports acroforms and static xfa forms. \nhttp://www.qoppa.com/pdfstudio/\n", "Q: How do I install drivers for ATI X1650 Pro I am running Ubuntu 12.04 32-bit and I have an ATI X1650 Pro 512mb but there are no drivers for my video card in the restricted drivers. How can I install drivers?\n\nA: Unfortunately, the ATI x1650 is no longer supported by AMD/ATI's binary drivers; neither the \"restricted\" ones nor what you can download off their website.\nThe last binary driver package supporting this card is Catalyst 9.3; you can try downloading and installing it. If it doesn't work (due to kernel changes), sorry, but you're stuck with the default open-source radeon driver.\nThis isn't because of Linux/Ubuntu, but due to AMD/ATI policy; for example, there are no Windows 7 drivers available for the X1650 either!\n", "Q: How do I start an SSH session from the Unity desktop with arguments (-i)?

(although Nautilus does support ssh://user@host as a shortcut for SFTP). You can useAlt+F2 to get the graphical \"Run\" command box, but IIRC even that won't automatically bring up a terminal for ssh, etc. \nYour best option might be to create a launcher (.desktop) with the full ssh command-line (as is), and set the \"Terminal\" property to \"true\". Call it \"SSH-EC2\" or something and you should then be able to start it directly from the HUD/Dash (gnome-terminal will automatically open and close when your SSH session ends)\n\nA: You can set a host-specific rule in you ssh-config file. Open (or create if doesn't exist) the file $HOME/.ssh/config and add the following lines to it:\nHost ec2-something..etc.compute-x.amazonaws.com\n    User ubuntu\n    IdentityFile /path/to/mykp.pem\n\nNow you should be able to use make a connection to the server using the ssh:// URL.\nYou may find more details about it on man ssh_config.\n\nA: I just wrote quick post explaining ssh config file in bit more details.\n", "Q: How to fix gksu / kdesudo? kdesudo(2831) KDESu::KDESuPrivate::KCookie::getXCookie: No X authentication info set for display \":0\" Command (in terminal):\n    leafpad\nResult: Leafpad without root rights working fine.\nWhat did I do to cause the error?

My best guess is that the run of apt-get autoremove has caused this error in the first place. (I do not recommend to run this command).\n", "Q: How to know which network is connected? How can I see using command-line whether I am connected to network using eth0, eth1 or wln0 etc?\nWell, to elaborate, I have a desktop sidebar which I installed using program \"conky\". This sidebar has meter that shows internet speed. Since I am not using eth0, I need to make a minor change in ~/.conkyrc file. I need to replace \"eth0\" with whatever network is being used by my wireless card to connect to internet (via a router).\n\nA: You may very well be connected to multiple networks at once, depending on your setup.\nIf you are interested in knowing which interface is being used for Internet traffic, try using the ip route command and look at the default route.  For example, on my system it shows that traffic will travel over eth0 if it isn't matched by any of the other rules in the table:\n$ ip route\ndefault via 192.168.0.1 dev eth0  proto static \n169.254.0.0/16 dev eth0  scope link  metric 1000 \n192.168.0.0/24 dev eth0  proto kernel  scope link  src 192.168.0.10  metric 1 \n\n", "Q: How do I install iTunes? I have an iPhone and run Ubuntu on all of my personal computers. Since I did not want to keep a separate partition with Windows on it for the sole purpose of running iTunes, I attempted to install It using Wine. \nI installed Wine 1.4 from the Software Center and installed iTunes 10.6.3. When I tried to run it I got a slew of error messages. I hopped over to google where it was suggested that I install it through PlayOnLinux. I did so with the same result. Further googling revealed that iTunes 10.6.x is confirmed to work with Wine 1.5.1 and up. \nI installed Wine 1.5.1 following the instructions I found and was unable to get it to open.

It says it is not bug, and occurs because these models are not included in upstraem tarball. But I don't know how to install these models.\n\nA: Short answer: I think you are out of luck.\n\nLong answer: reading the page you linked:\n\nAny additional model has to be added by the user. Oregano models are\n  in spice format and are therefore widely available, for instance this\n  site gives a list of SPICE models available for free on the web:\nhttp://homepages.which.net/~paul.hills/Circuits/Spice/ModelIndex.html\n\nwe have good and bad news. The good news are that Oregano uses standard PSPICE files (and PSPICE has been the most used electronic circuit simulator in the past decade). The bad news are that it seems every model that one would like to use must be manually added to /usr/share/oregano/models folder.\nThis could even be doable, the problem is that reading at the model index page:\n\nNote that for some of the models you may have to find the appropriate\n  link on the page given, or extract it from a compressed file, but many\n  of these links will take you straight to the manufacturer's download\n  link.\nAlso note that some sites require you to register first before\n  downloading models. However, once that is done, the models are free.\n\nseems clear that this task is becoming more and more time consuming at each step that we take (and there are even quite a few broken links!).\nI've managed to find other resources, for example this page and this one. The last one seemed to be particularly promising, two big zipfiles directly downloadable here and here, for example, plus other resources.\nAgain, the problem now is that unziping these two zipfiles, we have a huge collection of PSPICE models without any linking with Oregano's library names (I was trying to use a TTL 7400b component - a standard NAND gate - but I couldn't find the component in these two huge libraries, both searching for 7400 and NAND).\nI've even tried to google for oregano library torrent to see if a kind soul had already uploaded such a collection, but still no luck.\nSo the final response is: creating your own library is doable, but very time (and mind) consuming.\nProbably you'd better look at this question and pick another free simulator of your choice.\nGood luck!\nP.s. if you decide to assemble your own library, it would be nice if you'd share it in some way (e.g. torrent, emule, etc.). Many other people will thank you for this.\n\nA: Answer: You're not screwed.  \nI found the models in another, previous github location. Ah the joy of open source shared software on cloud computers. It's like your high school yearbook photo - it never dies...\nIt seems that once someone migrated the code from the original to the new master distribution, a number of models went missing from the new oregano distro.  Don't quote me just a guess.\nMost are located here:    https://github.com/drahnr/oregano/tree/master/data/models\nI couldn't find the LF357.model but I googled one here LF357.cir\n\n\nA: As mentioned, you may need to install your own PSPICE models.\nFrom the error message it looks like you need the model for the part 7400.\nHere is a resource for PSPICE models, including a library for 7400.\nHopefully, you can extract and use it.\n", "Q: Why is Chromium not updated automatically as Firefox is? Firefox was automatically updated to version 14 a few days ago through update manager, but Chromium web browser is still stuck in version 18 while Google Chrome is already in version 20. Why does this happen and how can I update my Chromium to a more recent version?\n\nA: No the project isn't dead. The Ubuntu Chromium Team just doesn't have enough people working on it, that's why the Ubuntu packages are out of date. Benjamin Kerensa is currently reaching out to new developers to support the team here. So the situation will hopefully improve soon.\n\nA: Ubuntu's version of Chromium is maintained by the Ubuntu developers.  So after the Chromium developers update, Ubuntu developers then take a look at it to see how it works with Ubuntu and makes any necessary modifications.  This is the only advantage to using Chromium over Chrome.  To use Chrome on Ubuntu, you have to download the version from Google and trust that they made it work properly with Ubuntu.  \nIf you'd rather get the latest version, without regard for whether it's been approved by Ubuntu developers, then you should just use Chrome.\n\nA: In a Linux distribution, software doesn't usually use its own internal \"automatic update\" mechanism.  Instead, it relies on the distribution to update it.\nThis is the case for both Firefox and Chromium supplied with Ubuntu.\nThe interesting thing here is that Firefox and Chromium have a different level of support from Canonical, and also that Firefox on Ubuntu has a somewhat unusual release strategy.\nFirefox is included in Ubuntu's main repository, whereas Chromium is in the universe repository.  This means that Ubuntu's version of Firefox receives the best level of support directly from Canonical, whereas Chromium's support relies on the Ubuntu community.  Most packages in universe rely heavily on the work of Debian developers, and Debian has different priorities.  So, based on this you would expect Firefox to include more Ubuntu-specific customisation, and to be better supported with updates.\nThe thing is, almost all software in a stable-release distribution (like Ubuntu, and most other distributions other that the \"rolling release\" ones) should not receive updates to new versions of software during the life cycle of that version of the distribution.  At best, it should receive only minor updates or security patches.  Firefox on Ubuntu is somewhat unusual here, because Ubuntu are providing full major new upstream versions of Firefox to their stable distributions.  \nThe justification for this will be Firefox's rapid release strategy, which ensures that \"major\" releases are actually somewhat less disruptive than most software's major releases, but also makes it quite hard to backport security patches to older versions.  So Canonical has obviously decided just to give Ubuntu the new upstream version than patch the old version.\nFor Chromium, it's not completely like this, but looks can be deceiving.  Chromium on Ubuntu sometimes does get new upstream releases (which is why even Lucid is on a v18.x), and other times the Ubuntu community patch the existing version with fixes and security updates, but don't increment its version number.  However, this means that despite the version number of Chromium in Ubuntu, it still includes some of the fixes that newer versions of Chromium have.\n\nA: The Chromium project lives here, with builds for Windows, Linux, iOS, Android etc.\nFrom the releases page, latest appears to be version 22. Not sure why launchpad.net doesn't have it.\n", "Q: How do I backup the pre-installed Windows before installing Ubuntu? I want to install only Ubuntu on my new laptop. But before that, I would like to make a backup of the Windows OEM installation on my laptop and then later, in case I wanted to sell the laptop, I would copy it back no the disk to increase my chances of selling it for a reasonable price.\nI want to do this without having to start Windows at all (i.e. accept EULA, etc.), and no, I don't want to dual-boot.\n\nA: You should use a bootable tool like Clonezilla to easily back up the OEM install (as well as any recovery partitions) on the hard disk. Clonezilla understands NTFS, so it will only backup (and optionally compress) the actual amount of data. \nUsing a raw block-level tool such as  dd, while possible, is not recommended because it will probably use much more space than a smart tool such as Clonezilla.\n", "Q: caffeine works but not for quodlibet I have caffeine installed, and it works just fine in gnome-classic (no effects) for preventing sleeping for most processes.

After installing the latest fglrx drivers, version 12.6, I need to drag the overscan slider all the way to the right to make the desktop properly fit my monitor. But now after every reboot the overscan image is very small and there is about a 2 inch large border around my display. When I open Catalyst Control Center the overscan slider is still as far to the right as possible, but when I slide it all the way to the left and then to the right again it fits my screen perfectly. How to I stop this small inconvenience?\n\nA: I used @user188647 's answer as inspiration, but the command wasn't working.\nSo I edited /etc/ati/amdpcsdb, and in the AMDPCSROOT/SYSTEM/MCIL section, added:\nDigitalHDTVDefaultUnderscan=V0\n\nThen I shut down the X server, started it up again and voila!

Because of skype sound issues I installed pavucontrol and I can change settings so the sounds work again with skype. I had to set both (recording&playback of skype) to \"built-in Audio Analog Stereo\" instead of \"Monitor of built-in Audio Digital Stereo (HDMI)\", I could only edit it when a skype call was in progress.\nBut unfortunately after a while not using skype the settings in the pavucontrol return to the default sink \"Monitor of built-in Audio Digital Stereo (HDMI)\", even though I press the lock sign in pavucontrol ...\nHow do I make the changes to pavucontrol permanent?\nI use Skype 4.008 in Ubuntu 12.04 (AMD64).\nInterestingly the \"Monitor of built-in Audio Digital Stereo (HDMI)\" does not show up in the \"Sounds settings\" of gnome-control, there is only one sink \"Analog output - built-in Audio\".\nI've uploaded to Pastebin the output from pacmd list-sinks and pacmd list-modules.\n\nA: A simple configuration setting helped me so far (half a year) on Ubuntu LTS 12.04. In pavucontrol in the last tab \"configuration\", I have two \"Built-in Audio\" section where I can choose a profile. The first one had \"Digital Stereo (HDMI) Output\" as profile. I changed this to \"Off\" and I had the above described problem not anymore. Here is a screenshot: \n \n\nA: From the question and the audio settings posted in the pastes from the commands list-sinks, and list-modules there may be an issue with a pulseaudio module to restore an output device. Let me suggest further steps to narrow doen the issue:\nTemporarily remove modules\nWe don not know if that helps but we may be able to narrow the issue down if we temporarily removed modules that are in question.\nTo remove a module issue the following in a terminal:\npacmd unload-module <index>\n\nThe present <index> will be listed from pacmd list-modules. Try to unload any single one of the following loaded modules (by index!) to test if it is the culprit:\n\n\n*\n\n*module-suspend-on-idle (because your issue is associated on idle of Skype)\n\n*module-loopback (because you don't need the \"Monitor of...\" device)\n\n*module-switch-on-port-available (unlikely but worth a try)\n\n*module-intended-roles (switches to the intended device when a phone call comes in)\n\n\nThe default setting with loading of the default modules will be restored by running\npulseaudio -k\n\nCheck for errors\nAlso you may want to see if there are any errors from pulseaudio in the system log files before your HDMI sink is connected.\nRemove user-space configuration\nSometimes we have erroneous configuration settings in the user-specific settings. To overcome this me may try if deleting ~/.pulse helps (it will be recreated on next start of pulseaudio)\nmv ~/.pulse ~/.pulse.old\npulseaudio -k # to restart pulseaudio\n\nGenerate a pulseaudio log\nAnother approach would be to check for useful messages to narrow down the issue by generating a pulseaudio log file from running pulseaudio in verbous mode (see here on how to do this).\nLet us know of the result to better point you to a permanent solution.\n", "Q: Missing tabs on taskbar I got shifted to a new workstation shortly.

But none of them seems applicable to me.\nIf I click on the network icon at the top right corner, it shows wireless as \"disconnected\" but it doesn't list available networks. If I uncheck/check the \"Enable Wireless\" option to reset, the option will stay as \"disabled\". If I uncheck/check the \"Enable Networking\" to reset the network interface, then the wireless shows as \"device not ready\".\nIf I run sudo rfkill list all, wireless shows as soft blocked: no and hard blocked: no.\nIf I run lshw -C network, wireless shows as DISABLED, and driver shows as rt2800pci.\nIf I run nm-tool, there are no wireless access points listed.\nThus I know my wireless card has a proper driver, it is not soft/hard blocked, and my desktop shouldn't have any hardware switch... \nSo what other steps I can go to trouble shoot this issue??\n\nA: I too had similar problem and sorted it of my own ubuntu is a great operating system  to play with. ok coming to business.

There is a reason on Ubuntu's website for downloading that it has 12.04 x86 (RECOMMENDED). Just because you have a x64 machine doesn't mean you need to use x64. x64 Simply means that you can run x86(x32) or x64 bit programs. You won't run into any issues with x64 bit programs on Ubuntu unless you are running Wine but even then wine will resolve your issues. I highly Recommend going back to x32 as it is recommended and if it worked before then it is definitely your best bet.\nEDIT\nI currently have a x64 bit machine dual booted with Windows 7 Ultimate (x64) and I run all my games and everything that I want to do on Ubuntu in a x32 bit environment without issues. There isn't a need for a x64 bit environment unless you are developing. That being said after you have read this then you have learned the most important part of OS is this x64 can run x64 or x32. Therefore if you put x32 12.04 on your system you won't have any problems as your system was designed to run either or. \nBTW x32 bit is lighter on the system and runs better than x64 and with no issues from using x32 then why not use the valuable resources and enjoy the extra speed. \nVery Respectfully Matthew Kaulfers \n", "Q: Fonts look strange in firefox I have just moved from Windows to Ubuntu 12.04 (with Firefox 11), and the fonts in some of my favorite sites (especially Hebrew sites) look strange.\nI looked at the CSS and saw such fonts such as \"David\", \"Arial\", etc. Apparently these fonts are not installed on my Firefox.

I tried installing using an .iso of Ubuntu 11.04 on a burned CD but the screens stops after flashing Ubuntu 11.04. Please help.\n\nA: I had an issue similar to this one. If you have a graphics card installed on your system then you will need to remove it completely and run the installation without the Graphics Card in there. Then you can put it back in after the installation. It is important to note that if you used WUBI to install your 12.04 then you shouldn't do a revert to 11.04 without first making a partition with your existing memory. Installing 11.04 alongside 12.04 and then  use a partition manager to format the 12.04 partition. After that then you can use that partition manager to expand the volume on the 11.04 partition.

Ubuntu 12.04 i am using, often without my command, it shows following:\n\nHow can i permanently stop/disable/kill this, using command line?\n(every-time it pop-ups like i am showing my own presentation, or i  left my PC for idle longer and came back to give my lecture, this Popup shows, which is very very annoying in many use case i had).\n\nA: On that Update Manager dialogue, click \"Settings\".\nThen, next to the option \"Automatically check for updates\", use the drop-down list to select \"Never\".\n\"\nYou can still get updates by opening Update Manager yourself and clicking \"Check\", or by using sudo apt-get update; sudo apt-get upgrade, but it won't pop up by itsself any more.\nFrom the command line you need to edit the file /etc/apt/apt.conf.d/10periodic\nI believe changing all those options to \"0\" will result in the behaviour you expect.\n\n\n*\n\n*How can I make Ubuntu check for updates less often?\n", "Q: Xorg server configuration fail - no screens detected I have a serious problem with Xorg server on ubuntu 12.04 (with nvidia 420M GT card).\nAt home I am using an external monitor connected to my laptop's HDMI port - the external display is used as extended.

There is a dl manager like Freerapid or something; but that doesn't support other sites. \nSomeone said me to use Jdownloader; But it loses CONNECTION now and then and then I had to manually reconnect the connection; SO i discarded that. So far i google, i got PLOSHARE pretty useful; but it also doesn't support all the sites above.  Any ideas?\n\nA: I would suggest Steadyflow. It's ridiculously light, and can be integrated into both Firefox and Chrome using FlashGot and Chromeflow respectively, so if you use both browsers, you still have a single, comprehensive download history.

Ubuntu is my distribution.\nI'm aware of a similar question here, but it doesn't seem to provide a concise answer.\n\nA: Ok so if you're running Ubuntu 12.04 you should have GParted (a partitioning tool) installed, to find it click on the Ubuntu launcher icon and type GParted and it should show up like this:  \nClick on it and then you should get something like this:\n\nYour Ubuntu partition will be on the one which has / in the mount point column. Windows usually takes primary partitions so Ubuntu is not likely to be /dev/sda1 or /dev/sda2, but feel free to post a screenshot of what your GParted shows if you need more help. Ubuntu is usually installed on ext File Systems as shown as an example in my screenshot above.\n\nA: In a terminal, run the command  df  and look at the output.  The column headed \"Mounted On\" will have a \"/\" against the partition that holds your root filesystem. This is where your system is installed.\n\nA: The non=NTFS partitions are where your ubuntu is.  Since windows cannot deal with EXT4 file system, the above screen from windows is not useful to you to determine much about Ubuntu drives.  Use GPARTED screen for that. I have a similar setup with ubuntu and windows dual boot.  I have created two other partitions to store my backups.  One has windows partition backup and one has ubuntu backup.  I boot of ubuntu live CD and use FSARCHIVER to make a ubuntu backup.  I use Ghost (old 2003) version to make a backup of windows partition.  Ubuntu backup seems to take care of GRUB and it seems to take it from sda1.  If the whole system conks out and now you can't boot, generally using system rescue CD, I am able to boot off the existing Ubuntu and then use Sudo update-grub to make grub and ubuntu functional again.  Generally that brings back my windows booting ability too.  Hope this helps.\n", "Q: How to install every thing on from the installation DVD? I have downloaded the dvd (12.04) and I want to sure I have installed every thing on it, so that I may save my INTERNET usage when I need to install new packages.\nThat is, apt wont download the packages that are already installed.\nAny idea ?\nthanks a lot.\n\nA: As far as I am aware, all apt frontends (apt-get, aptitude, synaptic, etc) will only download a new package if it's not already installed, however, it will download updated packages for anything you've installed, hence, installing everything may actually increase your internet usage.\nIf you make sure the line starting deb cdrom: in /etc/apt/sources.list does not have a comment # character at the start, and always put your DVD in when trying to install any new packages you want, then apt should use the DVD copy if it's still the latest version. Obviously, if there's an update on the internet, it will use that instead.\n", "Q: Unable to safely remove usb-drive I am unable to safely remove my Nokia E63 (connected via cable).\nError detaching: helper exited with exit code 1: Detaching device /dev/sdc\nUSB device: /sys/devices/pci0000:00/0000:00:1a.0/usb1/1-1/1-1.2)\nSYNCHRONIZE CACHE: FAILED: No such file or directory\n(Continuing despite SYNCHRONIZE CACHE failure.)\nSTOP UNIT: FAILED: No such file or directory\n\nWhat does this mean??\nThis happens with every USB storage device I connect and exchange data with.

If you don't know, open an app which will show you where your drive is mounted - GParted or Disk Utility for example.\nUssualy it would be sdc if you have two hard disks, or sdb if you have only one hard disk.\n", "Q: How to open file from Unity with non-default application Say I search for a recently used screenshot via Unity dash.

If you check the output of dmesg and look for the bios e820 map, you can see exactly what memory the bios is reporting your system has.  Typically the memory addresses between 3.2 GB and 4.0 GB is reserved for addressing hardware, such as video memory.

I'd like my cronjobs to be able to send mail from my home computer.  My servers configure exim4 like this:\ndc_eximconfig_configtype='internet'\ndc_other_hostnames=''\ndc_local_interfaces='127.0.0.1'\ndc_readhost=''\ndc_relay_domains=''\ndc_minimaldns='false'\ndc_relay_nets=''\ndc_smarthost=''\nCFILEMODE='644'\ndc_use_split_config='false'\ndc_hide_mailname=''\ndc_mailname_in_oh='true'\ndc_localdelivery='maildir_home'\n\nHowever, at home, my ISP blocks mail sent directly via a firewall.  I have a password proteced ssl smtp server that I could route the mail through, but I have been unsuccessful in figuring out how to configure exim4 to make this work.  I'm hoping somebody can give me a configuration example where I can plug in the host name, user name, password, and \"use ssl\" to get it to send mail through a single smtp server.\n\nA: If your ISP requires authentication, you should set dc_smarthost to the mail server hostname and port combination your ISP uses, and dc_eximconfig_configtype to \"smarthost\" like so:\ndc_eximconfig_configtype='smarthost'\ndc_smarthost='mail.example.com::587'\n\nThen, you can add your credentials to /etc/exim4/passwd.client like so:\nmail.example.com:username:password\nThen, any mail sent via your exim4 server will be routed through this mail host.\n\nA: This works very well for me. My ISP uses port 25 and dc_smarthost='myisp.mail.server:25'\nafter changing this files and issue commands:\n\n\n*\n\n*update-exim4.conf\n\n*/etc/init.d/exim4 restart\nAfter I made a test to send an email through exim4 classic sample like:\necho \"content of mail body with pt-br chars ação avião língua é essa em 1609.\" | mail -s \"Confirmar 16DOM\" my-user-in-isp@my-domain-url\n\nAnd these flow ok to inbox of my-user in my-domain-url.\n\nA: I finally found a detailed set of instructions by Tony Scelfo that actually work.  It appears that you have to use transport layer security (TLS) on port 587.  I have not gotten SSL SMTP to work.\nFirst run sudo dpkg-reconfigure exim4-config and use these config options:\n\n\n*\n\n*General type of mail configuration: mail sent by smarthost; received via SMTP or fetchmail\n\n*System mail name: <your hostname>\n\n*IP-address to listen on for incoming SMTP connections: 127.0.0.1\n\n*Other destinations for which mail is accepted: <your hostname>\n\n*Machines to relay mail for: <leave this blank>\n\n*IP address or host name of the outgoing smarthost: mail.example.com::587\n\n*Hide local mail name in outgoing mail?\n\n*\n\n*Yes - all outgoing mail will appear to come from your gmail account\n\n*No - mail sent with a valid sender name header will keep the sender’s name\n\n\n*Keep number of DNS-queries minimal (Dial-on-Demand)? No\n\n*Delivery method for local mail: <choose the one you prefer>\n\n*Split configuration file into small files? Yes (you need to edit one of the files next)\n\n\nThen run sudo vi /etc/exim4/passwd.client and add the following lines for your mail host, and any aliases it has (found through nslookup).  Substitute <email address> and <password> with the account you want to route mail through):\nmail.example.com:<email address>:<password>\nmail.yourhosting.provider:<email address>:<password>\n\nOnce you edit the passwd.client file, run sudo update-exim4.conf which will integrate your changes into your Exim4 config.\nRun sudo /etc/init.d/exim4 restart and make sure that the service stops and starts properly. If the service is unable to restart, something probably went wrong when you edited the passwd.client file.\nIf Exim4 restarted, go ahead and run sudo tail -f /var/log/exim4/mainlog to watch the mail logs. In a different window, send an email from your system and make sure that you see a record go by withR=smarthost T=remote_smtp_smarthost H=gmail-smtp-msa.l.google.com ... X=TLS-1.0:RSA_ARCFOUR_MD5:16 in it. The X=TLS means that the mail is being sent with transport layer security which is what you want.\n\nA: The server-name in /etc/exim4/passwd.client have to be the canonical name after the name-resolution\nexample for:\ndc_smarthost='securesmtp.t-online.de::587'\n\nit is the value sfwdallmx.t-online.de from :\n$ nslookup securesmtp.t-online.de\n...\nNon-authoritative answer:\nName:   securesmtp.t-online.de\nAddress: 194.25.134.110\nName:   securesmtp.t-online.de\nAddress: 194.25.134.46\nsecuresmtp.t-online.de  canonical name = sfwdallmx.t-online.de.\n\nThe file passwd.client looks like:\nsfwdallmx.t-online.de:user:pwd\n\n", "Q: Add quotation marks to selected word via shortcut Is there any way (Plugin, Script) to add quotation marks (or square brackets or parentheses) at the beginning and the end of selected text via a keyboard shortcut in the Kate editor?\nI think of something like selecting a word and then pressing Ctrl-U (this would upcase the selected word). Is there something similar for quotation marks?\nThe \"Configure Shortcuts\" menu does not provide this option.\n\nA: One solution would be the following:\n\n\n*\n\n*Go to Settings > Configure Kate > Editing \n\n*Activate the Auto brackets option\n\n\nNow you are able to wrap the selected text with brackets.\nThough there is one drawback. The Auto brackets option is \"always on\", meaning that once you type \"(\" the corresponding \")\" also comes up.\n\nA: I just checked out AutoKey, as I had read that it supports extensions via Python.

I have done this to convert old analogue music tapes to digital files via the PC. It is relatively simple to achieve, and will be even easier if the device you are recording from already is digital. (Although could you just transfer the tracks from your ipod to your PC?) \nAnyway, you need a 3.5mm to 3.5mm male to male audio cable (it is the same at both ends-i.e it has the standard headphone jack at either end). Install audacity from the repositories and start it running. Now connect the cable to your device and plug the other end of the cable into the pink (mic) socket on the PC. In audacity, adjust the volume of input (mic) until it is about the setting on the screenshot below (or less if you get distortion) and set the input to pulse:Mic:0. Now switch on your device connected to the computer, and adjust its volume as necessary. Then press record in audacity and you will get a waveform if you are successfully recording. Depending on your audio hardware, you may need to use other settings.\nIf you want, you can stop the recording after a few minutes and press play in audacity to see if the volume level is ok, and then restart a new recording. Audacity has some noise removal plugins, but you will only need to use those if you also decide to connect say a non-digital player and record from it in the future. If you have the proprietary codecs installed on your system you will be able to export your recording as mp3 and other formats.

I have the password (network key?) I think (!), I just need Ubuntu to detect the wireless automatically (and connect to it automatically whenever I start my computer). Im not very computer literate, so if you answer this question please take that into consideration before speaking another language! Thanks!\n\nA: If your networks card is configured and running Ubuntu already does that.

Pressing the keyboard shortcut should have the same effect as right-clicking at the cursor location.\nOn Windows keyboards, there is a dedicated button for this near the space bar. I have also read about using Shift+F10 or Ctrl+Space, but these have no effect on my system.\n\nA: Shift+F10 worked in my case. I guess the need of Fn depends on the keyboard you are using. \nP.S. I used this combination on a file in Nautilus (Ubuntu 14.04 LTS).\n\nA: I generally use the basic:\nCtrl+F10\n\nA: Make sure you have a package named xdotool installed.\nMake this application shortcut for the key of your preference:\nxdotool click 3\n\nUnfortunately this does not work on some applications, but seems to work on chromium-browser and firefox.\nBonus: For middle click the command is\nxdotool click 2\n\nMaking application shortcuts for keyboard may vary according to the desktop environment used. In Xfce (used in e.g. Xubuntu) making such shortcuts happens easily in Keyboard dialog.\n\nA: The keysym to trigger the context menu is called Menu. It can be bound to an arbitrary keycode like this:\n$ xmodmap -e 'keycode 68 = Menu'\n\nCan be manually triggered from the command line like:\n$ xdotool key Menu\n\nAnd to find out the keycode it is currently bound to one can do:\n$ xmodmap -pke | grep Menu\n\nTo figure out what keycode a key emits one can use:\n$ xev\n\n\nA: Some combination of: (shiftorctrl)+(F10orFnF10), the shifts and ctrls on the left of the keyboard should be used.\nIf you want the application context menu in Raspbian Pi Linux: alt+space\nContext key sometimes works: \nit is the one with the list and mouse pointer\n\nA: Try Shift+Fn+F10. This works on Windows and Ubuntu in VirtualBox on OS X for me.\n\nA: My solution was to find an old 2-button mouse and plug it in.\nI tried all the answers I saw above. Most seem to ignore part of the problem, which is that mac keyboards do not have alt or the windows key, in addition to the mouse not having two or more buttons. \nI also did not understand what they expected the cursor/mouse to be doing while you hit shift-f10 or whatever. I want to lock an icon to the launcher, there is no way to select it first and then hit some key sequence. I can hover over it, or I can left-click it. Left-click and hold, then key sequnce while holding? Doesn't seem to work.\nThe answer above with xmodmap and xev commands seems like it might point in the right direction. But It's more like a \"the solution exists\" rather than an actual solution. Which key can I remap without messing things up? Shift-f10 seems to do nothing now, how would I use xmodmap to map menu to shift-f10? At least it provides a place to start the web search. \nAlso, the menu that comes up when I invoke \"xdotool key menu\" while hovering the mouse over something is not the same menu that comes up when I right-click on the same item. So \"menu\" is not quite what the OP asked for.\n\nA: The keybinding for Mac is CTRL+SPACE. This should open the right click or \"context menu\".\nFor linux, the combo is supposed to be CTRL+F10 and as stated, you may need to toggle or hold down the fn key as well.\nHowever, you have mentioned, this does not work.\nSo, you may need to use the set keybinding for Mac instead as you are running linux on a Mac instead of a PC.\nClick here for more info and a more complete list of keybindings.\n\nA: On my system (Ubuntu 18.04):\n$ xmodmap -pke | grep Menu\nkeycode 135 = Menu NoSymbol Menu NoSymbol Menu\n\nThis is a Lenovo laptop. The laptop's built-in keyboard has a meny key between Right AltGr and Right Ctrl that triggers the context menu. A Logitech external keyboard that I use does not have a separate menu key. On that keyboard the combination Fn+Right Ctrl triggers the context menu.\n", "Q: How to find reason for slowing down while running Ubuntu? When working on the desktop, I sometimes encounter a sudden slowing down of Ubuntu Unity. I cannot reproduce the error but would like to be a proactive Linux user and find out what could be the problem.\nHow does your your error tracking system look like? I am looking for strategies, not only simple advice like: usetop. I want to slowly understand, which program is causing the problem and be able to send in bug tickets.\n\nA: It can be extremely difficult to understand the cause of things like that. Some bugs only happen in combination with other bugs, on particular hardware, etc. In those cases, you really need other types of data so that you can try to find common denominators. Apport is a bug reporting system that fetches relevant data. The ubuntu-bug command is even simpler. For instance, if you have a bug with Unity, you can press Alt+F2 and enter ubuntu-bug unity. \nIt is beneficial if you can provide information about what you're doing if you can reliably reproduce it. In your case, I would try to press Alt+F2 and enter unity --replace. If that helps, provide that information. \nThe unity command provides a few helpful switches as well, such as --log, --advanced-debug and --verbose. Debugging skills are very useful, but you might want to start with something simpler. \n", "Q: Differentiate between apk and jar files Is there any way to tell these two files apart? They're both identified as zip files using the command file, so is there a way to tell them apart? (Disregarding extension of course). \nNOTE: Trying to perform file analysis, both these files run through different analysis so I have to be able to tell them apart. \n\nA: APK file is just a JAR file with additional Android platform specific files included in it such as AndroidManifest.xml and classes.dex.\nJAR file is just a compressed ZIP file with additional metadata (MANIFEST.MF etc.) in a folder (META-INF).\nZIP file is a compressed single-file representation of a folder.\nSo, in a nut-shell all 3 formats are essentially just a ZIPped folder with additional format-specific metadata files.\nUse Android SDK's dx utility to generate all 3 formats from the same helloWorld.java file, then hexDump the 3 files, then diff them 2 at a time to confirm that they are nearly identical with 4 format-specific bytes being different. All other bytes are identical in the 3 generated files.\n\nA: APK (Android application package) is the file format used to distribute and install application software for the Android operating system.  It can only be used with the Android OS.\nJAR (Java Archive) is a archive file format typically used to distribute a set of Java classes.  These files are done using the ZIP file format and have the .jar file extension.  They can be used on multiple devices including those that have the Android OS.\nYou can convert apk to jar, and vice versa.\nAPK files are saved in a compressed .ZIP format and can be opened by any Zip decompression tool. You can either rename the file extension to \".zip\" and open the file\nJar file compresses and contains other files. Jar files are very easy to open. There are many programs that will open jar files. In fact, any program that can open zip files can open jar files. The jar format is identical to the zip file format.  Java runtime environment is needed to open Jar files.\nTo open APK files on your computer, additional software is needed.\n\nA: Not with official tools, probably not at all.\nThe DEX files are files converted in a language that the Dalvik machine can understand and execute, not necessarily java, the DEXs are just intermediary files targeting the Dalvik virtual machine, so technically speaking there is also no garanty that this DEX files are from a jar or from the java language.\nAt building time, when the apk is created, all the code that is not a native library is put in a DEX files. The \"jar idea\" simply doesn't exist and does not live in an apk file.\n\nA: apk files are only used by Android (program installers) and jar files are used on Java plateforms in general. You can see it with their meaning :\n\n\n*\n\n*apk : Android PacKage\n\n*jar : Java ARchive\n\n\nA: Your best bet would be to check the contents of the zip file.  All .apk files should contain an AndroidManifest.xml file, so the presence of that file in the ZIP index should be a pretty good indicator you have a file of that type.\nFor .jar files, checking for META-INF/MANIFEST.MF in the ZIP index is probably the best option.  Note that Android packages also include this manifest, so check if the file is a .apk file first.\nYou can use similar tricks for other ZIP based formats.  For example, Open Document Format files include a file mimetype whose contents should tell you the particular type of the file.\n", "Q: Virtual Packages ; offline installation problem I have a problem with offline installation of a package.

Do you know what's the deal with that?\nWhat would you recommend?\n\nA: This confusion is probably why they made it so all LTS releases are 5 years. :-) Since the desktop version of Ubuntu is simply a collection of packages, I would have to guess that that means those packages will not be supported after 4/2013. This would be all of the packages that make up the GUI, i.e. Gnome, etc. So, if you want to use a GUI with your laptop, I think you will be end of life after 4/2013, regardless of whether you install Ubuntu with the Server, Desktop or Alternate CD. \nOn a side note, have you tried Xubuntu? It uses a different Window manager (Xfce), so it is much faster on older hardware.

And if you're trying to open all windows from the terminal, you can forget it. I'm trying use the terminal as much as possible, and while I have Yakuake, it is still a bother having so many tabs and seeing which of those have an application I've killed and so on.\nSo, is there a way to open an application/file from the terminal so that the status doesn't show and immediately gives the prompt so that we can use it to open more applications?\n\nA: xdg-open file.dvi\n\nxdg-open will open any file with its default application. As a bonus, you can close the terminal without killing the application.\nSince xdg-open is quite a long name, I put an alias for it in .bashrc:\nalias open='xdg-open'\n\n\nA: With, say, evince file.pdf &, closing the terminal will still close the process, so that it is still a child process of the terminal and has no independence of it; nohup evince file.pdf & will allow you to close the terminal without the program closing as nohup means that any signals for the process to close (hangup) will be ignored. You can also disown a process in a similar way, see this discussion here. \n\nA: okular file.dvi &\n\njust append an & to make your command running as separate process.\n\nA: okular file.dvi &> /dev/null  & would be a bit better.

For instance, rather than hitting alt-tab N times to switch to my browser I could simply hit F1, for a terminal I could hit F2.  \nThe run-one solution in another question doesn't work as it launches a new instance.  The Launcher itself comes close as it allows me to use Super-[0-9] for pinned applications.  This would be sufficient if I could remap the launcher shortcuts to be single keys.\nPerhaps there is a dbus message that could be send from a script and the script could be tied to a custom shortcut?  A simpler solution would be great too.\n\nA: An ugly solution is to use xdotool to simulate the Super-[1-9] keypress.  The xdotool command sequence can then be mapped to a custom keyboard shortcut from  \"System Settings\" > Keyboard > Shortcuts\".  The commands to be run for the shortcuts are\nSuper-1\nsh -c 'echo \"keydown super sleep 0.2 key 1 super\" | xdotool -'\n\nSuper-2\nsh -c 'echo \"keydown super sleep 0.2 key 2 super\" | xdotool -'\n\nSuper-3\nsh -c 'echo \"keydown super sleep 0.2 key 3 super\" | xdotool -'\n\n\nA: I use AutoKey to map keys for switching to Terminal.

This is done as follows...\nBoot to live cd, open terminal (Ctrl + Alt + T) and type:\nsudo mount -t vfat /dev/sda3 /mnt\nsudo mv /mnt/EFI/Boot/bootx64.efi /mnt/EFI/Boot/bootx64.efi.old\nsudo cp /mnt/EFI/ubuntu/grubx64.efi /mnt/EFI/Boot/bootx64.efi\n\nAfter typing this and shutting down the machine, it let me boot into the normal grub bootloader, where you can choose to boot from Ubuntu or Windows.\n\nIf you recieve a Secure Boot message when booting from the LiveCD:\n - Turn the laptop off\n - Reboot using Assist\n - Press F2 to go to the Bios.\n - Find the Secure Boot option in the \"Security\" menu, press Enter and then select the \"Disable\" option and press Enter\n - Press F4 to save changes and exit the Bios.\nNOTE: You're unable to re-enable the secure boot option.

I am currently running Ubuntu 12.04 LTS, installed via Wubi on a Windows 7 machine. My HDD is 1 TB. When I installed via Wubi I used the maximum 30 GB installation size.

After resizing it, you can create a ext4 partition in the free space. Now you can boot Ubuntu and copy all your /home to the new partition. You would now be able to delete /home on the old Wubi partition, add the new partition in /etc/fstab, and you would have migrated your /home to a real partition with more space.\n\nA: If you do not want to switch to real partitions (which are IMHO better, since they would give you superior performance), you can extend your Wubi parition size: Is it possible to extend the disk space available to a wubi install?\n", "Q: What key to press to get to the BIOS and change boot sequence on a Dell desktop?

The search should also have the option of setting file size, date, type, and being case insensitive.\n\nA: When you use Nautilus, just click search from the top level of your home folder (i.e. where you can see all your folders laid out) and in the search box only enter .pdf (or whatever extension like .txt that you want to find). That's what I do and it just returned me all the pdfs in my home folder. You don't need to use a wildcard or put quotes around the search term in Nautilus search, unlike when you use search programs on the command line.\nThe gnome-search-tool can be used to search within files- select the home folder or the directory to be searched and then click select more options, and input your search term where it says 'contains the text.' It can be quite slow as it works without an index, but I have used it several times and it has been useful for basic searches.\n\nA: At the launcher you will see homefolder.

The ubuntu-restricted-extras meta package depends (indirectly) on either it or adobe-flashplugin.\nTo clear up possible confusion about what you see when you installed the package above, the .deb file contains an installer shell script.

Are you sure you didn't do anything else?\nIf you installed the proprietary Nvidia driver, you will probably stop using it if you move /etc/X11/xorg.conf to i.e. /etc/X11/xorg.conf.nvidia.old . Ubuntu should use autodetect and use the nouveau driver (which I guess works, since it worked in the beginning).\nYou could alternatively try to configure your nvidia card using nvidia-xsettings, it's a tool that comes with the driver.\nYou could also try inserting a ModeLine into your x.org. I'd suggest the other options first. Here's an example of a modeline that might work with your monitor:\n# 1280x800 59.81 Hz (CVT 1.02MA) hsync: 49.70 kHz; pclk: 83.50 MHz\nModeline \"1280x800_60.00\"   83.50  1280 1352 1480 1680  800 803 809 831 -hsync +vsync\n\nTry reading this section first: https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Xrandr#Adding_undetected_resolutions\nIf it works, you can add the modeline permanently like described in the next section in the link.\n", "Q: Installation of Realtek USB Wifi dongle I want to install a USB WiFi dongle under 12.04.

Is it possible to reduce this delay using vlc or other solution?\n\nA: if you are streaming over LAN, you could try using the networked X11 protocol directly instead. Try connecting from the remote machine with \"ssh -C -X user@remotehost\" (\"C\" for compression, consider removing if your network is fast). Now, in the remote shell session, you can show the webcam by i.e. \"mplayer -vo x11 v4l2://\".

If person A is at 4Gb of their 5Gb quota, and person B shares a folder, F,  with them with 2Gb data in it, has person A just gone 1Gb over quota? Or does all of the content of F always belong to B's quota?\n\nA: Person A in your scenario would have no issue, as they do not own the share. Quota for shares is counted against the share owner. However, if Person B grants read and write access to the share, Person A can alter Person B's quota usage by uploading new files to the share.\nBut quota is always counted against the owner, not the recipient.\n", "Q: Changed ownership/read,write on important system files, including SUDO I recently messed up my ownership and read/write rights to very important files which doesnt allow me to log in to ubuntu once past boot.

A load less than 1 means that the CPU could process extra tasks without having to queue processes.\nIf you have two CPUs (e.g.: dual core CPU), you could reach a load of 2 before the CPU is at its max; 4 on a quad CPU system, and so on.\n\nA: Load averages are the average of the %ge load of the cpu for the past 'x' minutes where s is 1,5,15.In your screenshot, it tells us that the avg load on your cpu is decreasing and the maximum is 1.54 %\n", "Q: How to change keyboard shortcut for Compiz Magnifier (currently alt-enter) I'm running Ubuntu 12.04 with Unity3D.  \nWhen I press Alt+Enter (a keyboard shortcut used by a number of things, especially Sublime Text), the Compiz magnifier is launched (creating a box around the cursor, and zooming the contents of the box).\nI tried to change the keyboard shortcut in CompizConfig Settings Manager (the \"Magnifier\" effect).  I changed it to Ctrl+Alt+Space, which is working for me.  However, Alt+Enter still triggers the effect.  \nIf I disable the effect, it stops.  So I know it is the magnifier effect.  I just can't figure out why Alt+Enter is still triggering the effect even after changing the shortcut.\n\nA: It is a bug and I am afraid it is currently in low priority.

The expression that's being used in this case is just example.com which is invalid. You'd have to use something like host example.com. Better yet, if you can use an IP address instead of example.com that'd be best.\nWith these expressions you can select traffic according to a wide variety of criteria, I suggest you have a look to see how things work. Incidentally, this is the same expression syntax used by tcpdump, so if you want to see which packets are being picked up by the filter/expression before using tcpkill on them, you can use tcpdump to test your expressions.

The system can write a chunk of data to the disk cache without actually waiting for it to be written to the disk. This is sometimes called \"write-back\" mode.\n\n\n*\n\n*If there is no cache on the disk, data is directly written to it in \"write-through\" mode.\n\n\n*The Asking for cache data failed warning usually occurs with devices such as USB flash drives, USB card readers, etc. which present themselves as SCSI devices to the system (sdX), but have no cache.\n\n\n*\n\n*The system asks the device: \"Do you have a cache?\" and gets no response.

Thus, How can I fix it ?\n\nA: This is a problem with the installer ; it is attempting to install the 32-bit version of MSXML (the Microsoft XML library) on a 64-bit machine (or vice versa).\nThe first part of the solution to this is to install the correct version for your machine. The downloads list is here ; the x64 version is probably what you need.\nAlas, unless the vendor supplies an x64 package, or will supply a package without MSXML bundled, or unless you open the package and tinker with it (in a tool like Orca, the MSI database editor), this is where the story ends. It's a shame MSI packages are so difficult to work with ; unlike .DEB which is just a fancy archive, MSI is a database (or a very fancy archive).\nThe other path is to consider installing a native package that provides the features you wanted out of the Windows software.\n", "Q: Why my upstart script don't work?

How do I type half letters to get compound letters in Sanskrit?\n\nA: ibus gives you some extra choices of keyboard layout, including the phonetic Kyoto-Harvard system for entering Devanāgarī.  astyuttarasyAM dizi devatAtmA -> अस्त्युत्तरस्यां दिशि देवतात्मा हिमालयो नाम नगाधिराजः| पूर्वापरो तोयनिधीवगह्य स्थितः पृथिव्यामिव मानदण्डः|| \n\nA: The UTF-8 sanskrit set makes composite letters quite simple to enter using the virama, http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virama. That is, a compound is created by entering each of the individual letters with a virama between each one. For example, क्ष  is composed of क ् ष , त्र is composed of त ् र, ज्ञ is composed of ज ् ञ, and so on.\nAs far as keyboard layouts go, this is probably up to personal preference. Anything which can enter the UTF-8 sanskrit range will do, even an on-screen keyboard (I created one here: http://www.devananda.net/kb/devanagari.html). I find the Hindi (Wx) layout very usable. \nTo select it, open \"System Settings\" -> \"Keyboard Layout\", select the \"Layouts\" tab, and click the small \"+\" sign at the bottom-left. Select the \"Hindi (Wx)\" layout and install it. You may need to log out and back in for some things to take effect. You can also click the small picture of a keyboard on the bottom-left of this screen to view the layout. In any case, using this keyboard layout, entering compound sanskrit letters is quite simple -- the \"a\" key enters a virama, and the font takes care of the rest.\n\nA: type ' d' it will be a 'halant'. it means if you want to type 'pra' you have to type 'h' + 'd' + 'j' .\n\nA: Google Transliteration works reasonably well. It is almost phonetic.\nFor offline use, Indian keyboard layout (symbol in) that uses d for halant, D for अ, k for क, etc. works quite well. \n", "Q: Reinstall Ubuntu wit UEFI for better performance?

What do you think?\n\nA: The main difference is the faster boot, and  is that UEFI is better in communication with hardware & firmware. Below are some advantages of using UEFI.\n\n\n*\n\n*Ability to boot from large hard drives\n\n*Faster boot-up time\n\n*Support for more than four partitions on a single hard drive\n\n*Better power managment\n\n\nOn a personal note, I haven't really noticed much difference using UEFI with either a SATA II or III hard drives, but a friend has noticed  a difference using an SSD. If you would like to use UEFI go ahead and take a look at UEFIBooting\nNote: In order to install OS in UEFI mode, you have to have a boot device which contains UEFI bootloader.\n", "Q: where can I find binaries of xscreensavers for ubuntu 12.04 LTS I am trying to find out where I can find binaries or Deb xscreensaver packages to download for my ubuntu 12.04 LTS system?\n\nA: It is avaialble ubuntu software center.\nYou can click → xscreensaver \nto get the app\nor in command prompt sudo apt-get install xscreensaver\n\nA: You can get it from Official Launchpad page here and for Precise Pangolin Source package download Binary packages from here.\nAlternately ,try here at Packages.Ubuntu through Search box, the selecting Precise for OS based searching .\nOr view through this Package xscreensaver Searched result.\n", "Q: How to manage service relations in Juju at fine grained unit level? My service recipe: DB Server <-> App Server <-> Web Reverse Proxy.\nMy relation requirements are:\n\n\n*\n\n*1 unit of DB Server related 1 (specific) unit of App Server\n\n*1 unit of Web Reverse Proxy related to all App Servers\n\n\nGiven below is a sequence of Juju commands, that will happen in my case\nExpected Steps are (correct me if I am wrong):\nPhase - Install\n\n\n*\n\n*Deploy Db \n\n*Deploy App Server\n\n*Deploy Web Reverse Proxy\n\n*Add relation App Server to Db\n\n*Add relation Web Reverse Proxy to App Server\n\n\nPhase - Scaling\n\n\n*\n\n*Add unit Db \n\n*Add unit App Server (Problem step):\nOh no! I don't need the automatic behavior based on Provides/Required setting in charm metadata. I want to specify the App server to Db relation at a unit level here. \n\n\nIdeally, I want the relation-xxx hooks to fire only on the new unit of Db.  May be an add-unit  parameter passing mechanism similar to one proposed for deploy ?\nMy thoughts for a work around given the current features are as following:\n\n\n*\n\n*One way is to conditional execute in callbacks. Check if already related to a remote unit and ignore the incoming relation-added/Changed call back.  Would be messy. When restarting services may be buggy cause of sequence of start for each db app unit pair has to be carefully managed or wrong app service will talk to wrong db service. I am already using Juju as a back-end service with a python script managing the juju cli.\n\n*Another way is that I have a specific code which is common to the app server / db pair. Much like the set command for post deploy phase, can I use it to set values to specific service instances post add-unit?   \n\n*Another option is a subordinate service with a container scope - but I want Db as a separate machine instance not on the app server machine instance..\nAs for the web proxy, I expect the hooks to be fired, so proxy can add the new app server as a back-end. Current Juju behavior is ideal.\nI am looking forwards to a optimal way to go about this. Thanks in advance..\n\nA: It sounds to me like you want the two appservers to be uniquely bound to unique database servers. This would mean that they are really two separate services. This might make sense then:\njuju deploy mysql app1-db\njuju deploy app app1\njuju deploy mysql app2-db\njuju deploy app app2\njuju add-relation app1-db app1\njuju add-relation app2-db app2\n\nThis will make it so app1 and app2 are both independent (even though they have the same charm), which I THINK is what you want. If you want them both to be load balanced from the same haproxy:\njuju deploy haproxy app-reverse-proxy\njuju add-relation app1 app-reverse-proxy\njuju add-relation app2 app-reverse-proxy\n\nNote that older versions of haproxy couldn't handle this (before charm revision 23).\nHere is the bug which tracked the fix:\nhttps://bugs.launchpad.net/charms/+source/haproxy/+bug/1029078\n", "Q: Are Intel HD 4000 graphics supported on Ubuntu 10.04 LTS?

Browsers like Firefox show the URL in human readable form in the address bar, though when you copy it to the clipboard it is still encoded. There must be something wrong with either where you are getting the links from or plowshare needs a feature to convert and process those links correctly, like similar applications have.\nIn case of wget proper usage would look like this:\nwget http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batman_%28disambiguation%29\n\nHowever putting link in single or double qoutes work, as well as escaping the characters in question with \\:\nwget 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batman_(disambiguation)'\nwget http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batman_\\(disambiguation\\)\n\nThe latter one is the most time-consuming solution, as you have to know which characters to escape and it gets very messy pretty fast.\nOf course I was searching for the mesh network routing protocol.\n", "Q: Sound card selection I'm looking for a way to select sound card in Lubuntu 12.04 without installing any additional packages like xfce4-mixer (with all of its dependencies).

I have changed base theme and made also some modifications (change fonts, sizes, icons sets etc)\nI would like to save all and test some other themes and restore them back.I'm using 12.04.\nIs this possible ?\n\nA: I have found a way to save  and restore theme settings. Actually It restores all your personalized settings.\nTo Backup\nOpen a terminal and do this\ncp ~/.config/dconf/user  ~/settings-backup\ncp -r ~/.gconf/apps/metacity ~ \n\nThis will copy the user settings in your home directory in a file named settings-backup. The window manager theme (window framing) will be stored in a folder named metacity in the home folder\nTo Restore\nOpen a terminal and do this (I assume your backup file is in your home folder with the name settings-backup)\ncp ~/settings-backup ~/.config/dconf/user\ncp -r -v ~/metacity ~/.gconf/apps\n\nThis will restore the theme  settings and the window manager settings. (Note that, If you delete a theme, it can't restore that theme) \nLogout and Login again, to see all your settings are restored.\n\nA: All your configuration and preferences are store in your /home folder, as a hidden folder. If you backup your home folder you'll be able to restore to your previous configuration. For example, I use Lubuntu 12.04 and have a hidden folder in ~/.config/openbox with some of my system settings.\nRelated: How to migrate user settings and data to new machine?\n", "Q: Issues with alternate Windows software and Wine I am running a non-popular windows software with PlayOnLinux and numerical fields like currency/monetary has an error with duplicated decimal separators.\nNumbers are displayed as follows (with Brazilian locale):\n\n,200,00\n\nAnd, if I change Ubuntu's locale settings (to US locale, for example):\n\n.200.00\n\nMy question is: How can I solve this problem? or Where can I ask this question if AskUbuntu isn't the right place?\n\nA: WineHQ.com is the place to report such issues.\nOpen a ticket on the site and let the developers help you with your situation.\n", "Q: Is it required to update Ubuntu every day or week? Why do we need to update every day or week. Every week 150MB of update? \nThis is similar to Windows (sorry I do not want to blame any one). I believe updates are to cater some loop holes, deficiency; does this means that the software was released before full testing?\n\nA: If you are on a stable release, updates should not amount to 150MB/week, but quite less. Ubuntu has an excellent release policy, and with a few exceptions no software is allowed to release a major upgrade within a release. As such, most updates you will see are software minor upgrades, bug fixes, and security issue fixes.\n\nOnce an Ubuntu release has been completed and published, updates for it are only released under certain circumstances, and must follow a special procedure called a \"stable release update\" or SRU.\n- From StableReleaseUpdates page on the Ubuntu Wiki.\n\nAs compared to Windows, Windows has its own share of baggage with Windows Updates, except that the updates are released monthly (mostly), instead of on a rolling basis.\nAs such, it does not mean that \"the software is released before full-testing\", rather that there are improvements (bugs/security/features) that you can use.\n\nA: Capt.Nemo's answer is great. On a more general note, consider this:\nAn operating system, such as Ubuntu, consists of thousands (if not millions) of lines of code, all written by human beings. Every piece of software you run, on top of Ubuntu (Firefox, Thunderbird/Evolution, Gnome-Shell, Pidgin, etc), range anywhere between a couple hundred to several thousand lines of code, written also by human beings (usually different ones). \nHuman beings are fallible creatures, and maintaining that much code gets confusing very quickly, even under the best of circumstances. It can be easy to forget the side effects something has, change something marginally related, and introduce a bug, because of the interaction between the two marginally related things. It can be even easier to write something that you think is good (or, in some cases, just something that works, but is ugly, due to a time crunch), and have to go back and redo it, because it introduced a bug, or worse, a security hole.\nTo further add to the difficulty, there are hundreds of different computer setups, which can affect the functionality of a given piece of software (particularly at the OS and hardware driver levels, where things aren't as abstracted). Sometimes, no matter how much testing a team does, bugs don't even appear until the software is released into the wild.\nTherefore, the updates you get every day, or every week, are for those little changes, bug fixes, security fixes, and various other little updates. If you use third party PPAs to get the latest versions of things, then it might even be larger version updates, which include new features.\nThe most common logical mistake people do when it comes to software is compare it to physical structures, such as bridges. Bridges can be declared \"finished\" and not need touched for many years (save maybe for repairing the roadway part, where cars drive and wear it down). Bridge design can be tested and retested in theoretical environments (from using math to determine the optimal angles for strength, to scale models) and the requirements for the bridge can be determined at the very beginning of the project. None of this works for software development (as repeated failure of Waterfall projects has proven time and time again), where there are times when the developers may not even know that a given requirement exists until production time, thanks to all of the little details that come with software development. Therefore, a software project is never considered \"done,\" that's why there are versions and releases, and feature additions to begin with. Those daily/weekly/monthly updates are the product of constantly updating and improving and tweaking of a piece of software.\nOr, to put it another way, if everyone waited to release their software until there were no more bugs, at all, and nothing needed tweaked or fixed, and the software was absolutely perfect, no one would release any software. (That's not to say everyone releases software without testing it, there are simply thresholds of what is \"acceptable\" for a given release, and what can be put off until post-release updates.)\nThat said, you don't have to update every day, or every week, or ever, really. The developers can't force the updates onto your computer. However, it's in your best interest to update periodically. Allowing security updates to install silently is a good way to make sure you get the most crucial updates, and running updates at least a couple times a month ensures that you're not fighting bugs that have already been fixed.\n\nA: You can mitigate the impact of these updates by enabling automatic updates and adjusting the update interval:\n\n\n*\n\n*How do I enable automatic updates?\n\n*How can I make Ubuntu check for updates less often?\n", "Q: Problem with package dependencies in Qt4 library I'm having a problem with dependencies in the qt4 library, and I'm not able to install anything via the apt-get command.\napt-get update gives me a normal output.\napt-get clean and apt-get autoclean do the same.\napt-get-install -f gives the following output:\ndpkg: errore nell'elaborare libqt4-xmlpatterns:i386 (--configure):\n libqt4-xmlpatterns:i386 4:4.8.1-0ubuntu4.1 cannot be configured because libqt4-xmlpatterns:amd64 is in a different version (4:4.8.1-0ubuntu4.2)\n\ndpkg: errore nell'elaborare libqt4-xmlpatterns (--configure):\n libqt4-xmlpatterns:amd64 4:4.8.1-0ubuntu4.2 cannot be configured because libqt4-xmlpatterns:i386 is in a different version (4:4.8.1-0ubuntu4.1)\n\ndpkg: problemi con le dipendenze impediscono la configurazione di libqt4-declarative:i386:\n libqt4-declarative:i386 dipende da libqt4-xmlpatterns (= 4:4.8.1-0ubuntu4.2), ma:\n  La versione di libqt4-xmlpatterns:i386 nel sistema è 4:4.8.1-0ubuntu4.1.\n\ndpkg: errore nell'elaborare libqt4-declarative:i386 (--configure):\n problemi con le dipendenze -

This is true for some items available in the Software Center as well.\n\nA: Software in linux distributions is organized into packages.  Each package either contains user facing software like Firefox, or libraries like libasound2 which is required by firefox.  If you install Firefox, the apt system will figure out what prerequisite packages exist, will download and install them.  Now, these packages are generally distributed as binary files that have already been compiled for a given processor architecture, but the exact source used to compile that version of a package is available via apt-get source firefox.\nThe vast majority of things in Ubuntu's repositories of packages are open source.  But Ubuntu does have a list of approved proprietary software.  While this software doesn't satisfy the freedom goals of Ubuntu, they are greatly desired by the community, and provide a lot of value.  Examples of this are Skype or Sun Java (now removed).  These packages are not listed on the Ubuntu packages site.\n", "Q: What is IMAP+? And how is it more advantageous over IMAP?

Thanks for your help in advance!\nProcedure\nFirst, I have installed the following packages with:\nsudo apt-get install unixodbc unixodbc-dev freetds-dev tdsodbc\n\nand configured freetds as follows:\n--- /etc/freetds/freetds.conf ---\n[TS]\nhost = SERVER\nport = 1433\ntds version = 7.0\nclient charset = UTF-8\n\nUsing tsql tool I can successfully connect to the database by executing\ntsql -S TS -U username -P password\n\nAs I need an odbc connection I configured odbcinst.ini as follows:\n--- /etc/odbcinst.ini ---\n[FreeTDS]\nDescription = FreeTDS\nDriver = /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/odbc/libtdsodbc.so\nSetup = /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/odbc/libtdsS.so\nFileUsage = 1\nCPTimeout =\nCPResuse  =\nclient charset = utf-8\n\nand odbc.ini as follows:\n--- /etc/odbc.ini ---\n[TS]\nDescription = \"test\"\nDriver = FreeTDS\nServername = SERVER\nServer = SERVER\nPort = 1433\nDatabase = DBNAME\nTrace = No\n\nTrying to connect to the database using isql tool with such a configuration results the following error:\n$ isql -v TS username password\n[IM002][unixODBC][Driver Manager]Data source name not found, and no default driver specified\n[ISQL]ERROR: Could not SQLConnect\n\n\nA: In my case the problem arose because of simple indents in my config file. So in /etc/odbc.ini, I removed all indents and voila!\n(odbcinst.ini behaves like a normal kid and doesn't seem to throw any tantrums.)\n\nA: Ubuntu prior to 12.04 had a different odbc path in the /etc/odbcinst.ini file.\nThe old driver path was:\nDriver = /usr/lib/odbc/libtdsodbc.so\n\nI changed it to:\nDriver = /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/odbc/libtdsodbc.so\n\nHere's the full configuration:\n--- /etc/odbcinst.ini ---\n[FreeTDS]\nDescription = tdsodbc\nDriver = /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/odbc/libtdsodbc.so\nSetup = /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/odbc/libtdsS.so\nFileUsage = 1\nCPTimeout = 5\nCPReuse = 5\n\nWorks like a charm now!  Thanks!\n\nA: Thanks, your post was very useful for me.  I was able to get it to work by eliminating the following lines from my odbcinst.ini file\nSetup = /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/odbc/libtdsS.so\nFileUsage = 1\nCPTimeout =\nCPResuse  =\nclient charset = utf-8\n\nso now my odbcinst.ini file looks like this:\n--- /etc/odbcinst.ini ---\n[FreeTDS]\nDescription = FreeTDS\nDriver = /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/odbc/libtdsodbc.so\n\nand my odbc.ini file looks like this now:\n--- /etc/odbc.ini ---\n[TS]\nDescription = \"test\"\nDriver = FreeTDS\nServer = SERVER\nPort = 1433\nDatabase = DBNAME\n\nOnce I simplified everything it worked great.   I still can't get it to work with RODBC but it worked with isql.\nI don't know if this will help but your post helped me.

I want the Super key to behave as a regular modifier key, just like Ctrl, Shift and Alt.\nCurrently, it doesn't.\nUsing the System Settings to set a shortcut like Super+Up will set the shortcut, but the shortcut will be unusable. Pressing Super+Up instead functions just like pressing a single Up. The Super modifier is ignored and the shortcut never gets activated. Likewise for shortcuts such as Super+W (i.e. it's like pressing an unmodified single W).\nI've used CompizConfig to unbind all Unity-related shortcuts, but Super still behaves in this weird, special way.\nHow can I create keyboard shortcuts such as Super+W that work?\n\nA: CCSM -> \"Commands\" should work (sudo apt-get install compizconfig-settings-manager).\nThere's also that dirty hack .. \nReplacing \"super\" with \"Mod4\" in ~/.gconf/desktop/gnome/keybindings/custom0/%gconf.xml seems to work after restarting X. \nThere might be compatibility issues if you bind already existing shortcuts, say \"Mod4+Tab\". \n", "Q: Desktop Search Tool with Lotus Notes Integration Hey Fellow Ubuntu lovers,\nI switched a while ago from Win. to Ubuntu and I am loving it!

What about:\nsudo clamscan -r --move=/tmp/virus /mnt/windows-partition\n\nto show only infected files add the -iswitch\nPerhaps you should do a sudo freshclam before scanning to update your virus definitions.\n\nA: Though my way of solving such problems isn't related to Ubuntu, it still may be valuable.\nOne of the best antiviruses - Kaspersky Anti-Virus - provides a method to cure severely infected installations of Windows. They provide Rescue Disk in ISO format and it is absolutely free. It is powerful and fully functional. It is based on Gentoo distribution with KDE. You can burn it to DVD or make a bootable USB.\nBoot from it (it can be run in grahical and text modes). There are several shortcuts on the desktop. Run \"Kaspersky Rescue Disk\", update the virus definitions, because they are old (you will need to setup Internet connection). Select the objects you wish to scan (boot sector, start-up objects, partitions) and press \"Start Objects Scan\" button.\nThis ISO can be downloaded here: https://support.kaspersky.com/viruses/rescuedisk.\nOn the same page you will find several guides: how to burn disk, how to use the product. These guides are detailed and pretty explanatory so I decided not to duplicate them here. Also there you can find some info regarding UEFI.\n\nA: Avira also offers a rescue cd, which can be downloaded here: http://www.avira.com/en/download/product/avira-rescue-system. It is a standalone live CD. Just boot it, update the signature files, and run it. You can also install clamAV and scan your windows partitions with it if you can mount them under Ubuntu. This should be relatively safe, as it is very unlikely that you have a cross-platform virus on your windows partitions. However, it is not entirely impossible, so using a live cd is the safer option here!\n\nA: There is lots of bootable anti virus disks you can use, I would recommend AVG Free.

Sometimes it doesn't.\nFor instance, when I highlight text in Firefox, then go and middle click into terminal vim, nothing happens. \nWhat is going on?\nThank you!\n\nA: Caused by separate X/DE clipboards;  keep them synchronized with ClipIt\n\n\n*\n\n*As ImaginaryRobots' answer explains there are two different clipboards: the X clipboard and the desktop environment/window manager clipboard (Gnome/Unity, KDE, etc.); depending on the selection method used (i.e. just highlighting, or an explicit Ctrl-C/right-click copy, etc.), the two clipboards may not be synchronized.\n\n\n*\n\n*Thus, there are often issues when copying/pasting between GUI programs and the terminal.\n\n\n*The easiest solution if you have this problem is to use a tool that keeps both these separate clipboards in sync. I recommend ClipIt (sudo apt-get install clipit)\n\n\n*\n\n*Start clipit (add to Startup Applications for convenience), and under Preferences, check both the Use Primary and Synchronize Clipboards options:\n\n\n\n\nA: There are actually 2 different kinds of copy & paste - there's the one provided by the underlying X11 graphics system, and there's the one provided by your window manager (Gnome, KDE, etc).  \nHighlighting text without clicking is enough to get it copied to the X11 buffer-space, and middle-clicking will paste out of that.  If you use control-X or control-C, it will use the window-manager's buffer space as well (since you had to have highlighted it to use those keys), but only a control-V will get the text out of there - middle clicking won't.  \nTo make things more confusing, window manager copy & paste will work with non-text items too, so even if your highlighting had gotten some text into both buffers, you might then have some files or complex data in the window-manager buffer instead and the two will be out of sync.\nSome applications are smart enough to understand and use both, others aren't.  Terminal windows are usually of the stupid variety when it comes to copy & paste.  There are usually settings for each application to tell them how to fix the copy & paste mess, but getting them all set up correctly is a lot of work.  Ubuntu gets most of them by default, I think.\nThe situation was historically much worse, and led to freedesktop defining standards around it:\nhttp://standards.freedesktop.org/clipboards-spec/clipboards-latest.txt\n\nA: Okay so when you select the text, you must click on an empty area to deselect the text and then middle click wherever you want to paste it, if you don't deselect the highlighted area then it will NOT work.\n", "Q: What is the default username and password for Ubuntu 12.04 via Startup Disk Creator?

If you try to login to Livemocha today (18 August 2013 - maybe they will fix it), using either Firefox or Google Chrome, their site will not let you login or create an account if you are using Linux.\nI have to say that up to now I have never encountered a webpage (even on microsoft.com) that is quite as hostile to Linux as this. I am a long-time Livemocha user, and even paid for an account there (which I now regret), but I think it's time to move to one of the alternative language-learning sites.\n\nA: Hi I figured that livemocha requires flash version 11.3 or higher and somehow my firefox and chromium browser were showing  11.2 in http://www.whatismyflash.com/ .

I have a system dual-booting Windows 7 Pro and Bio-Linux (\"Bio-Linux provides more than 500 bioinformatics programs on an Ubuntu Linux 10.04 base\" 10.04 is LTS, supported until April 2013).\nI have grub set to show the list of operating systems at startup and wait for user input to select what OS to boot into. I'd like to run remote desktop on both operating systems. I am very familiar with the Windows side but new to Ubuntu. \nDo I need a separate IP address for each OS or can I use the same one on both? Right now I have two different IP addresses, one assigned to each OS, but I'd be happy to use just one if that is possible.\nHow can I control which OS to remote in to if I use the same IP address?\nI got remote desktop to respond on the Ubuntu side but it seems to only give me the terminal, how can I get to the GUI desktop?\n\nA: You can use the same IP address for each OS, since only on OS can be on at a time. Depending on the functionality you want, you may need a separate remote control program for each OS. Here are some of the common options for Ubuntu:\nVinagre - The benefit of this is that it is available in the repos, and uses VNC, which is one of the original remote control programs. When you connect using VNC, it brings up the desktop, exactly the same way that you would see as if you were in front of it. i.e. if you  open a program on your physical desktop, walk away, and then remote control in with VNC, that program will still be open. Any VNC viewing program will work fine with this solution.\nX2Go - X2Go is, in my opinion, a nicer remote control program. It allows you to start a new session (or connect to a previously running session). This means that if someone were sitting in front of your desktop, you could start a new session, so you would not interfere with their work. It is also more secure as it transfers the data over SSH. The server component is not available in the repos, unfortunately. More information on installing it can be found on the x2go website. \n", "Q: get files off machine in recovery mode I have a virtualbox VM that is broken. It won't boot normally. I don't want to bother trying to fix it but I do want to get some files off it that I need.\nIf I hold down the shift key I can get to a prompt allowing me to boot into recovery mode and from there I can select the option netroot and I'm in.  I can get to the files on that machine which I need and the internet works (I can run wget --spider http://example.com succesfully.) So it seems like I should have everything I need to get the files off. But how? I thought about trying to setup an FTP server but I'm wondering if there isn't an easier way.\nI am running Ubuntu 12.04 on the host and 10.04LT on the client (VM). \n\nA: I do this regularly and you don't even have to start the virtual machine itself. The idea is to mount the disk image on your host machine.\nTo do this, you'll need virtualbox-fuse:\n$ sudo apt-get install virtualbox-fuse\n\nYou can then mount the image using vdfuse. Per example, mounting a VDI image (VMDK and al are also supported), as root:\n$ mkdir /mnt/vdi\n$ vdfuse -f /path/to/disk/image.vdi /mnt/vdi\n\nIn /mnt/vdi, you'll have a disk image for each partition and one for the entire disk:\n$ ls /mnt/vdi\nEntireDisk  Partition1  Partition2\n\nMount the partition you want:\n$ mkdir /mnt/guest\n$ mount /mnt/vdi/Partition2 /mnt/guest\n\nAnd that's it. You can now copy your files from /mnt/guest to your host machine without any network overhead whatsoever.\nIt's also useful for a ton of other things other than backing up broken VMs. ;-)\n\nA: An easy way would be to enable SSH on your host, then mount a folder via SSH on your VM.\nOn the host:\nsudo apt-get install openssh-server\nmkdir ~/vm_backup\n\nOn the VM:\napt-get install sshfs\nmkdir /mnt/host\nsshfs [username]@[host]:/home/[username]/vm_backup /mnt/host\n\nNOTE:\n\n\n*\n\n*Replace [username] with the username on the host. \n\n*Replace [host] with either the IP address or hostname of the host\n\n\nThen you can just copy everything you need to /mnt/host\nWhen you are done, if you do not want SSH anymore, simply uninstall it.\nsudo apt-get remove openssh-server\n\n", "Q: When installing, how can I have multiple mount points on a single partition?

I am creating a new file either by using  \nin terminal: touch newfilename.someext  \nor  \nin nautilus: File > Create New Document > Empty Document  \nThe file takes on the type \"plain text document\" and gets associated with the default text-editor. How can I turn-off these 2 actions?  \nThe .somext is a new/unknown extension and I expect the system to show it as an unknown file type. \nEdited August 10 2012:\nI noticed that if you have a non-printing binary character in the file, then it will show as type \"Unknown\". \n\nA: Your question is all about MIME types.\nMIME type is resolved not only by file extension (glob patterns), but also by file contents (magic rules).\nSee http://library.gnome.org/admin/system-admin-guide/stable/mimetypes-modifying.html.en#-note-id301200:\n\nWhen no glob patterns or magic rules match a file, then it is resolved\n  to the MIME type text/plain if it contains textual data or\n  application/octet-stream for binary data. If the file is empty, then\n  it defaults to text/plain.\n\nSo exactly as you noted, file with unknown extension is resolved to text/plain, but if it contains binary data, it is resolved to application/octet-stream, which is shown as \"Unknown\" (if you are curious why, search for \"application/octet-stream\" in /usr/share/mime/packages/freedesktop.org.xml).\nIf you need to register new extension and associate some application with it, you should first register new MIME type, associated with desired extension, and then associate some application with this new MIME type.

I really like Lubuntu and I would like to use it permanently from my USB flash drive, not just in \"try-mode\" as LiveUSB...\nThanks for any help\n\nA: Live distro is running from RAM memory, which means booting is slow but after that, running (in RAM) is super fast. \nWhen you install it on USB flash it is running from flash. Flash is much slower than hard disk and hard disk is much much slower than RAM, so it is normal that in RAM Live version is faster. \n\nA: You seem to think the problem might be a process that is eating too much (processor, memory, disk).\nTo check, use htop (for memory and processor) and iotop (for disk)\nTo install, sudo apt-get install htop iotop.

If using xubuntu, you can use Thunar (at least on Xubuntu 13.10, tested with iPad Air) or Gigolo - the remote system connection manager but Nautilus works too if you have it installed. You can also use ifuse to mount in the filesystem hierarchy.\nIf you need to use iTunes for backups, easy sync or upgrades without jailbreaking, I would recomend installing virtualbox and a win XP or 7 in it.

It was helpful for me! Click me\n\nA: There are lots of ways to do that.  \nUsually the virtual machines network card is connected to a pre defined network called NAT.  That network does always run a dhcp-server that gives a IPv4 address to the virtual machine.  It is usefull because you can reach internet through that and the host machine.  But each virtual machine get its own NAT network.  So it can't talk to any other machine.\nOne sollution is to set the network card to use an Internal Network. You can have many of those, all named differently, and all virtual machines that connect to the same Internal Network is connected to each other.  The problem is that now there are no dhcp-server or router running in that net.  So you have to set uṕ the machines to use static address and without any connection to the world (through NAT or bridgeing).\nBut you could add a virtual machine with two internet cards that works as a router(with NAT) for your internal network  One connection to your Internal network, posisble with a dhcp-server for your net, and one NAT or Bridge to talk to the rest of the world.\nNow you have a working Internal Network for your machine and Internet connection through the virtual machine that works as a router.\n", "Q: Something about fcitx-table-boshiamy Recently I've installed fcitx to replace ibus, but inside this boshiamy table, no matter which version, older 0.1.0-1(precise) or the latest 0.3.1-1(quantal), all got the same problem: \n\nany word with \"z\" as it's code, all couldn't appear normally, the input method will take \"z\" as \",\" or \"a\" sometimes even \"b\"\n\nCould someone try to fix it up?\n\nA: I'm fcitx dev, I think I fix this in 0.3.2.\nSorry for the inconvenience.\nTry manually removing the line with PY in boshiamy.conf (/usr/share/fcitx/table) before the updates hit the repo.\n", "Q: Hibernation error message During Ubuntu hibernation the following messages appear on the screen and they are accumulated until the system is completely restarted.

I like to keep a separate /home and / root partitions. I've been using (K)Ubuntu for around a year now and my / partition (almost 36Gb) never climbed over ~13Gb of used space.\nWhat would you say is the appropriate maximum size one should set a / partition to?\n\nA: It is not possible to give an answer with a specific size as it varies between taste, need, system, setup and such.\nIf you have / and /home on same partition or on separate partitions. For someone with a typical setup where they got /home on the same partition, then they might want a larger size, while in your case you have them on separate partitions you don't need the system partition to be as large.\nSomeone with a large hard disk drive can be more generous when partitioning while someone with a small solid-state disk may opt for a smaller system partition.\nThere is no optimal figure, so since 36 gigabyte seem to have worked good for you, I think you should continue using that.\n\nA: Firstly, there is no /system partition. The thing you are referring to is better called as the root directory /, which is where the \"root\" of the file system is kept. As you have already seen, keeping a separate /home partition allows you to limit the size of / by quite a bit. \nI've found 15gb an adequate amount for most installations. You could go lower, but the challenge I've most often faced is the apt archives taking up space while upgrading. If you install lots of \"large\" software, or keep things in other places such as /var (web server files or databases for eg), you could either keep /var on a separate partition as well, or increase the size appropriately.\n", "Q: How to fix \"*:i386 cannot be configured because *:amd64 is in a different version\"?

I have to introduce the linux server onto the network, but without AD services (like dhcpd, ldap etc).\nSo I was hoping to create a runlevel that'll allow me to bring the linux server up on the network without these services, then, when I've removed the windows server, I can change runlevels and start ldap etc.\nI remember reading that runlevels are deprecated - is this correct? - If so, how can I achieve my goals?\n\nA: Before I'd asked my question, I didn't know about upstart.  For those interested, upstart is an event-driven (instead of a state-transition driven) replacement for the old \"System V init\" system.\nTo get to the point and skip the documentation, have a look at the /etc/init folder.  You'll find several .conf files in there.  Editing these files allow you to control at which runlevels different services come up and go down.  These include samba4.conf, which was the main one I was concerned about (as this also controls ldap, kerberos, etc).\nI initially went to /etc/init.d/rc2.d and wondered why there were no entries for samba there.\nJust to confuse the issue, bind9 (along with other services) is still configured via the old system V init scripts in /etc/rcx.d, so, I rm'd /etc/rc2.d/S15bind9 and made a symlink K15bind9 to the same target in /etc/rc2.d/\n\nA: Runlevels determine which services are started and what processes will run. A default ubuntu system boots up runlevel 2 where it will have all of it services up and running.\nYou could try creating your own runlevel for example on runlevel 3, but it will be quite a hassle, it might be easier to simply boot the system without the NIC cable plugged in and simply stop DHCP. Then introduce it and when the old server has been decomissioned simply start the DHCP.\nKeep in mind the following are reserved no matter what:\nrunlevel 0 = halt sytem\nrunlevel 1 = Maintenance Mode (single usermode)\nrunlevel 6 = reboot\nI hope this helps you on your way.\n", "Q: Can't boot after kernel upgrade to 3.2.0-27 from 0-26 on dual boot my system is dual boot Win7 / 12.04 \n/etc/fstab looks oK\n\n/boot on sda5\n/     on sda6\n/home on sda7\n\nfdisk -l is fine shows 3 sep logical partitions\n\n/dev/sda3                             Extended  ( group container for 5,6,7\n/dev/sda5  nnnnn    nnnnn  500MG  83  Linux  <-- grub also here\n/dev/sda6  nnnnn     nnnn  40 GB  83  Linux\n/dev/sda7  nnnnn    nnnnn  60 GB  83  Linux\n\nas listed above, before the attempted upgrade, / , /boot, /home  were on 3 separate logical partitions and /etc/fstab looked OK. \nwhat seems to have happened in the upgrade is that grub lost track of the 3 separate partitions and could not process a logon from a user whose /home directory was on another partition. \n/var/logs/auth.log would show a failure for that user when i tried to logon after the upgrade...\nlightdm: pam_succeed_if(lightdm:auth):requirement \"user ingroup nopasswdlogin\" not met by user \"rob\" \n[system] rejected send message, 2 matched rules; type='method_call', sender=':1.103' (uid=104 pid=nnnn comm='/usr/lib/indicator-datetime/indicator-datetime-ser') interface''org.freedesktop.dbus.properties' member='getall' error name='unset' .... \n\nI go to grub menu and go to 'recovery' for 3.2.0-27 then 'drop into root'...\nif i look for /home  there is NOTHING.\nif i look for /boot/grub , there is NOTHING\nif i then go back to the sub-menu where i dropped into root , selecting 'grub updte bootloader' this time, i retreive the references to /home and to /boot/grub and everything looks consistent. \nthen , i try to reboot from the internal menu from recovery and it goes to the logon for my account , i give the passwd and it just dies with a back-lit screen. \nSo, im really stuck.. Unable to revert to 3.2.0-26  and unable to stitch together the grub components in order to go forward with 3.2.0-27. \ni don't think anything is corrupted but grub seems to be confused and i do not know the sequence of commands to use to recovery to where i was on 3.2.0-26.\nFOOTNOTE \nI wanted solution like 'aaa' says below where grub update would have been used to somehow restitch the elements of dual-boot back together. Matt scared me into a re-install from my USB stick which was vanilla amd64 ( dont think that it had the alternate solution ).\nIt looked like all the elements were there after using 3.2.0-26 recovery and grub recovery. It looked like grub was there - altho im not sure that it was back on /dev/sda5 where originally put it.\nThere seems to be something very brittle in the dual boot solution where Win7 is primary controller of MBR and MBR points to grub on /dev/sda5. \nThe funny thing is that after i reinstalled, i eventually got to 3.2.0-27 working on my laptop. I did this by doing apt-get update and then by responding to the shaking icon in Unity UI for updates. The big update included 3.2.0-27 update that had failed earlier . ONLY THIS TIME IT WORKED??\nI can only say that the outcome of system software upgrades is suspect when you have the dual boot topology where orig Win7 MBR forwards to grub on the first of the logical sdaXX partitions created during an install where you choose to create your own partitions. \nI will be very wary of this situation when i decide whether to apply uprades when Unity prompts me. \n\nA: I am currently dealing with the same exact issue. To fix it you are going to HAVE to reinstall Ubuntu. If you don't you will mess up the boot kernels on Windows 7 and Ubuntu and you will have to reinstall Windows 7 and Ubuntu from the ground up. Heed my warning when I tell you this. I followed instructions to fix this online and it ended up deleting all my previous kernels.\n\nA: I ran into this same problem (Lubuntu 12.04 64-bit). During the upgrade process from 3.2.0.26 to 3.2.0.27, all files in /boot/grub seem to have been deleted so GRUB cannot start. I fixed GRUB by using the Lubuntu \"AMD64 alternate install\" disk and choosing \"Rescue a broken system\". After answering all the various setup questions, choose the root partition of the broken system for the root prompt from the list of partitions (eg /dev/sdb1). Then execute sudo grub-install /dev/sdb (assuming the previous MBR was on /dev/sdb) followed by sudo update-grub and reboot. This worked for me.\nIn your case, it looks like you need to choose a root prompt into /dev/sda6. The reason you don't see anything in /boot or /home is because the partitions /dev/sda5 and /dev/sda7 are not mounted. Because you have /boot on a separate partition you need to mount it. Assuming the file system is ext3, the command is:\nsudo mount -t ext3 /dev/sda5 /boot\n\nThen execute sudo grub-install /dev/sda followed by sudo update-grub and reboot. The update-grub command should find and list all the various operating systems on your partitions including Windows.\n", "Q: xubuntu 12.04 Thunar deletes files with permission r--r--r--. Is it a bug? I tried to prevent my digital photos (.jpg files) from accidental deletion using\nchmod 444 *.jpg. All permissions are set and displayed correctly in a terminal (ls -la) as well as in thunar's file properties > permissions. The files are displayed with a lock symbol.\nEven though, whenever I press \"delete\", the marked file is moved to trash.\nMy expectation was that files without write permission could not be moved to trash.\nIs it a bug or am I just wrong assuming that moving a file requires write permission?\n\nA: Actually, Nautilus behaves the same (as does bash terminal).  You can delete a read-only file, because it is the directory permissions that control that operation.  In theory, you can't write to a read-only file, although many editors will delete the original (or make a backup), then write to a new file, so it seems that you can write to the read-only file.\nIf you were to make the permissions for a directory r-x, then you would not be able to delete any files (but you could still write to the files, assuming they are not read-only).\n", "Q: How do I configure Pidgin to allow video chat with people using WLMessenger?

I looked for answers on the interweb, but nada. I'm running 12.04.\n\nA: If you are looking under \"Displays\" and you see this then it is a bug in the system and you don't have anything to worry about. Ubuntu doesn't run any different on a Desktop than on a Laptop anyway. (Besides the differences in hardware affecting the OS ergo RAM, HDD, ETC.)\n", "Q: New motherboard, Windows drivers? Perhaps it's a silly question but I've recently purchased a new motherboard and of course it came with a CD with it's drivers only for Windows systems (you know, the Autorun cr@p and all that)\nSo, should I somehow try to obtain these drivers from the vendor for my Linux system or is that not necessary since the OS installation will take care of it by itself?\n\nA: In the Linux world (this isn't specific to Ubuntu), drivers are normally included in the operating system. Anyone writing a new driver is encouraged to contribute their work to the Linux driver, and that usually happens. Each new release of Ubuntu comes with more supported hardware. So, ideally, you should not need anything besides what Ubuntu provides.\nHowever, if the motherboard model is recent, there might not be drivers for all of its features yet. Usually, the manufacturer takes care to have Windows drivers ready the day the product ships, and the Linux development only starts when a developer receives a board. Some manufacturers collaborate with Linux developers. The best among them follow normal channels and have their drivers incorporated quickly in the official kernel and in distributions (this is more common on server equipment, less on desktops and laptops). Other manufacturers provide token Linux drivers — rushed, low-quality, hard-to-install. Yet others do nothing.\nWhat you should do is try installing the latest release of Ubuntu and see if it works. It is rare for manufacturer drivers to hold an advantage over official Linux drivers when the official drivers exist. If it doesn't, do a web search on your motherboard model and “Ubuntu” to see if others have solved the problem for you. If you can identify the component that doesn't work (e.g. the disk controller, the sound chipset, …), do a web search with that.\nIf it doesn't work and your search doesn't turn up anything, ask here! Be sure to give as much information as possible: the exact motherboard model (with a link to the description on the manufacturer's site so people can easily find out what components it includes), a precise description of what happened (black screen, disk churning for a while, beeps, error messages, …). If there are any error messages, transcribe them exactly (if you're in a situation where you can't copy-paste, a legible screen photo is better than nothing).\n", "Q: How do I remove google chrome which is not starting anymore?

I tried apt-get purge but with no success. What do you suggest?\n\nA: Run the following command as root: apt-get purge google-chrome-stable.\n\nA: Go to /usr/bin, edit google-chrome. I did it with Kate.\nAt the end of exec -a \"$0\" \"$HERE/chrome\" \"$@\", add --user-data-dir, so it looks like this: exec -a \"$0\" \"$HERE/chrome\" \"$@\" --user-data-dir.\n\nA: Kill chrome in system monitor and then try removing it.\n\nA: You can kill Chrome from the System Monitor: Launch it from the Unity ta sk bar (it's just called \"System Monitor\") or launch it from the terminal with gnome-system-monitor -- you'll see all running processes under the \"Processes\" tab. You might have a few \"Chrome\" processes running (I had four just now) -- select the processes called chrome and use the \"End Process\" button to kill them. \n", "Q: Grub Problem, Boot-Repair not working I am using a Wubi installation installed through Windows 7.

So for example, when I type Shift-F12, it types \"This is wonderful!\" in whatever Gnome app I'm in at that time.\n\nA: I found the answer - autokey. This lets you set up shortcuts that can be triggered either by a hot key, or simply typing an abbreviation.

I'm making some changes on my grub file under /etc/default/grub. In some tutorials I have seen sudo update-grub and others sudo update-grub2. What is the difference?\n\nA: There is no difference.\nUbuntu 9.10 and later have GRUB2 installed, but sudo update-grub has still prevailed as the standard command.\nsudo update-grub and sudo update-grub2 are equivalent, so it doesn't matter which one you run. /usr/sbin/update-grub2 is just a symbolic link to /usr/sbin/update-grub.\nek@Del:~$ ls -l `which update-grub update-grub2`\n-rwxr-xr-x 1 root root 64 May 17 03:07 /usr/sbin/update-grub\nlrwxrwxrwx 1 root root 11 May 17 03:22 /usr/sbin/update-grub2 -> update-grub\n\n\n\n*\n\n*Actually, generally speaking sometimes one command can be a symbolic link of another, and yet they behave differently, because the executable checks how it was invoked (i.e., by what name) and behaves accordingly.\nThat is not the case for update-grub2 and update-grub though, which are both provided by packages like grub-pc that provide GRUB2. Furthermore, /usr/sbin/update-grub is actually just a short shell script that does most of its work through yet another command, and we can look at its complete 3-line source code (in Ubuntu 12.04) to see that the name used to invoke it is not checked:\n#!/bin/sh\nset -e\nexec grub-mkconfig -o /boot/grub/grub.cfg \"$@\"\n\n\"$@\" expands to all the command-line arguments passed after the name update-grub or update-grub2, but not that name itself. And this is the only place in the script that command-line syntax is checked at all.\n", "Q: Windows 7 Virtual box If I install Ubuntu along side my windows 7 installation can I then boot into the Ubuntu and launch the windows 7 via the virtual box?  Or does the windows OS have to be installed via the virtual box to work?\n\nA: VirtualBox is a \"virtual computer\"; it looks like a full computer to the programs, and includes audio, video, disk drives, etc.  When it starts out, it is like a brand new computer without anything installed. \nIf you have a Windows CD, you can install windows within VirtualBox just like installing it to a new computer; same with other Windows versions or Linux.  You put the Cd in, or mount an ISO image of a CD, and reboot the virtual machine (called the \"guest\" OS).  The host OS continues to run normally while this is happening.\nBut you can't run the existing windows 7 OS in virtual box, or simultaneously with Ubuntu.\n\nA: The question seems to ask if the Linux OS can run the Win OS on the other partition. The answer is \"NO\".\nVirtual Box create a new \"box\" inside the Linux session, doesn't run the Windows installed alongside his Linux.\nDifferent solutions are:\n\n\n*\n\n*mount the Windows partition in Linux, in order to access data;\n\n*install windows program in Linux, via Wine or PlayOnLinux (that's a wrapper).\n\n\nA: Windows XP will work within Ubuntu virtualbox.  This is how some gamers & other people run Windows programs.\nMany people, myself included, run Windows7 programs with WINE, or PlayOnLinux, which to varying degrees of capability, might work.\nApple OS-X users have the similar problem.  IMHO - to be an Apple OS-X user, you are best to avoid Apple-branded hardware because you can get better hardware components in PC and notebook world.  \n", "Q: How to disable keyboard shortcut list on holding Super key?

I would like to have two shortcuts each for \"Put Left\" and \"Put Right\" for positioning windows in the left and right position.\nSpecifically, I would like the default keys as well as some custom keys that are more accessible when typing:\ni.e.:\n\n\n*\n\n*Put Left: <Control><Alt>KP4 and <Shift><Alt>H\n\n*Put Right: <Control><Alt>KP6 and <Shift><Alt>L\nThe CompizConfig dialogue box appears to only allow one shortcut key to be assigned.\nHow can I have two shortcut keys enabled for a single grid compiz-config setting?\n\nA: One way to do it is simply map the custom secondary keyboard shortcut to the primary (Compiz) shortcut using xdotool.\n\n\n*\n\n*xdotool is a small command-line utility which allows automation of keyboard and mouse clicks/movements; install it with sudo apt-get install xdotool\n\n*We'll assume here that the default shortcuts for Grid Left/Right are as below: (Ctrl+Super+Left/Right):\n\n\n*Open Settings...Keyboard, and go to the Shortcuts tab. Click + to create a custom shortcut, naming it say Compiz GridRightAlt, and setting the \"Command\" field to:\nxdotool key --clearmodifiers Ctrl+Super+Right\n\nClick Apply.

If you have svn you can do this using \nsvn checkout http://pycompiz.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/ pycompiz-read-only\n\nInstall after navigating into the projects folder, \nsudo python setup.py install\n\nNext create these two tiny python scripts, and place them in your ~/bin folder. \nThen either make them executable (chmod u+x FILENAME) or when setting the keybindings use python SCRIPTNAME. \nfile: putleft\n#/usr/bin/python \nimport compiz\ncompiz.call('grid', 'put_left')\n\nfile: putright\n#/usr/bin/python \nimport compiz\ncompiz.call('grid', 'put_right')\n\nLastly you can create two custom command shortcuts for each of these scripts in the custom commands section of the compiz config (ccsm), and hey presto - two keybinds to achieve the same effect.

I selected the bridged adapter, and it would normally work fine when my laptop is connected to my wireless router. I just use the IP address of eth0 resulted from command ifconfig.  But this morning, after I failed to authenticate myself to the library's free wifi, I was trying to telnet from my hosting OS to the virtual OS and found that there was no IP address of eth0. I tried configuring an IP address to eth0 using command sudo ifconfig eth0 x.x.x.x and setting an IP(which was in the same subnet as the previous one) to the hosting OS as well. But after all this, it still won't work. Is it because a switch or router is needed to assign IP addresses to the interfaces?\n\nA: When using Bridged mode, Yes you need to be connected. Since all traffic is bridged over the Physical Adapter.\nTo make it work when not connected use a NAT connection or HostOnly. Disadavantages of both are that other computers on the physical network cannot access the machine. However when using NAT you can add Port Forwards from your local machine to the virtual machine.\nI hope this helps\nKind regards,\nJochen.\n\nA: In bridged mode, to work without a router/DHCP server, you need to assign a static IP to the guest within the same subnet as the host (and no conflicts!!)\nUse Network Manager to do that on Ubuntu Desktop -- the old CLI network config commands (ifconfig, resolv.conf, etc.) are often overridden by the Net manager before they can take effect. \n", "Q: using pipe with bundle show and gnome-open (I asked an almost identical question on stackoverflow with no response.

If I go to the terminal and type gksudo gnome-ppp (of course gnome-ppp must be installed, but you can also use wvdial) and click on Setup and then on Detect, it detects the Vodafone USB modem (it also works with my other 3G device, a Huawei E1690 USB stick). \nAt init strings, I make Init2 = \"ATZ\" and Init3=\"ATQ0 V1 E1 S0=0 &C1 &D2 +FCLASS=0\".\nAs for the rest of the settings I use:\nNumber: `*99***1#`\nUsername: user\nPassword: pass\n\nThis connects to the Internet seamlessly, but it does take a little while to get connected.\nAs for the Network Manager, I still can't seem to get the connection available in the menu.\nHope it helps you, if anyone out there knows how to get my connection in the network manager menu please let me know. :)\n\nA: TO detail the above for vodafone data card K3372, Create a file name by using terminal (or CRTL+ALT+T) and type sudo gedit /etc/usb_modeswitch.d/12d1:1526 now add the following code:\nTargetVendor= 0x12d1\nTargetProduct= 0x14bc\nMessageContent=\"55534243123456780002000080000a11062000000000000100000000000000\"\n\nand save the file.\nNow in the terminal type the following: \nsudo gedit /lib/udev/rules.d/40-usb_modeswitch.rules\n\nCopy the line that contains \"12d1\" and \"1520\" (or any other line), paste/insert it somewhere else and change the second value from \"1520\" to \"1526\".\n\nA: This worked for me.\nThis is for new vodafone data card, model K3772.

Why, I don't know. But, there must be something in Windows which has to activate the device first. \nHope this is of help.\n\nA: The best way is to unlock the card is from Windows:\n\n\n*\n\n*Connect to your vendor from Windows (unlock the stick)\n\n*Reboot and boot from Ubuntu (do not unplug the usb stick)\n\n*Connect from Ubuntu\n\n\nThis procedure must be repeated every time you need to use the stick from Ubuntu.\nHope an easier solution will be occur soon.\n\nA: This is for new vodafone data card, model K3772.

I modified a .bin file for the software ELAN so the path to one of my libraries is correct (after installation, ELAN can't find the library because the path is not right). So I used Emacs to correct this.\nBut when I use the commands to install the .bin file:\nsudo chmod +x ELAN_440_linux_novm_install.bin\n./ELAN_440_linux_novm_install.bin\n\nI get the error message:\nPreparing to install...\nExtracting the installation resources from the installer archive...\nThe size of the extracted files to be installed are corrupted.

As you already noticed, this broke the checksum (maintained to ensure noone tampered with it and possibly introduced malicious code). A much better idea is to solve such issues outside, either by adjusting path variables (which would not work in this case), or by the use of symbolic links.\nIn your case, the solution is as easy as\nln -s /lib/i386-linux-gnu/libc.so.6 /lib/libc.so.6\n\nSo when looking for /lib/libc.so.6, the binary finds the symlink and \"gets redirected\" to /lib/i386-linux-gnu/libc.so.6 (to put it into easy words -- how it works exactly, you can read in the linked Wikipedia page; but for your understanding it suffices to think of it as a special kind of \"bookmark\" -- so even if the file itself gets replaced, the symlink stays valid, pointing to the updated file then).\n", "Q: What can I use to combine songs?

If you call your script with parameter localhost:8080 the shell will not translate this so the port will be regarded as part of the hostname.\n\nA: To fix this add the following to your /etc/hosts, if it is not already there which is on most if not all ubuntu releases:\n'127.0.0.1      localhost'\nHowever I agree with Jens. It seems your syntax is incorrect. Yuu say you run it against localhost:8080 however in your script port 80 is hard coded, meaning you actualy say port 80 on host localhost:8080 and of course that host does not exist.\nKind regards,\nJochen\n", "Q: How Do I Install Another Distro Over Ubuntu?

Can anyone confirm that I'm doing this right and whether I should click that scary looking \"Write\"?\n\n\n\n\n(selected N)\n\n\n\nA: I'm having trouble replicating your scenario -- if a partition is mounted, whether explicitly (fstab/mount), or implicitly (by Nautilus, etc.), GParted will not let you create a partition table on the parent device before unmounting. \nI suspect GParted successfully overwrote the MBR/partition table on /dev/sda. Rebooting WILL make the contents inaccessible, don't do it yet. If you are prepared to, I believe testdisk should be able to recover the partition table. \nThere should be a way to get the in-memory (kernel) partition table layout -- that's how you can still access the contents -- but I can't remember an easy way to do that. \nIn the meanwhile it may be a good idea to at least back the critical stuff up....\n\nA: Could you do:\nsudo fdisk -l /dev/sda\n\nThis way you should be able to see if it still recongizes the partitions, e.g:\nDevice Boot      Start         End      Blocks   Id  System\n/dev/sda1   *        2048     1171455      584704   83  Linux\n/dev/sda2         1171456     3125247      976896   82  Linux swap / Solaris\n/dev/sda3         3127294    15611903     6242305    5  Extended\n/dev/sda5         3127296    13869483     5371094   83  Linux\n/dev/sda6        13871104    15611903      870400   83  Linux\n\nIs what I get on my system. If it does not recognize your filesystem properly anymore then I am not sure whether there is much more you can do.\nI recommend making a backup of all of your most important files in this case, since you might be able to use fdisk or cfdisk to set the partition type, and afterwards use fsck to check the filesystem.\nBut I am not sure whether it will still fix your partition. Things like this can really be bummer, I accidentally typed rm -rf /tmp / once, in the split second that I pressed CTRL+C half of my /bin was already removed and I had to reinstall.\nI hope my advise guides you in the right direction and that you are able to fix your system.\nIf you run into anything just let me know.\nAnswer to Update 3:\nI believe Write is the way to go. It should restore the partition type and flags as they were before gparted. However I cannot state how important it is to have a backup just in case something does go wrong.\nAfter 'testdisk' is done run 'fdisk -l /dev/sda' again and post output.\n\nA: I just reproduced your problem in a virtual machine using fdisk instead of gparted.\nBefore I had:\n  Device  Boot  Start   End    Blocks   Id  System\n/dev/sda1   *       1    18    144553+  83  Linux\n/dev/sda2          19  2450  19535040   83  Linux\n/dev/sda4        2451  2610   1285200   82  Linux swap / Solaris\n\nI then used fdisk to delete partitions 4, 2 and 1 and create a new primary partition covering the whole disk. I then changed the type to NTFS (07) and wrote it to disk.\nfdisk -l /dev/sda then reported:\n  Device  Boot  Start   End    Blocks   Id  System\n/dev/sda1           1  2610  20964793+   7  HPFS/NTFS\n\nI then ran 'testdisk /dev/sda' which almost instantly came up with a list of partitions which when written were reported as:\n  Device  Boot  Start   End    Blocks   Id  System\n/dev/sda1   *       1    18    144553+  83  Linux\n/dev/sda2          19  2450  19535040   83  Linux\n/dev/sda3        2451  2610   1285200   82  Linux swap / Solaris\n\nThe only difference is that it moved /dev/sda4 to /dev/sda3. The VM rebooted successfully.\nIn your case, since mount shows you only have a single partition, /dev/sda1, testdisk should be able to recover it without any problem.\nIn any event, testdisk gives you the option of deciding whether to write its findings out, so you can't lose by running it. Obviously, you may need to do sudo apt-get install testdisk.\nOf course, if it's possible, it's probably prudent to back up anything critical.\n", "Q: Howto install biber on Ubuntu 12.04 I have solved it.

(I want this to be accessible from outside the local network.)\nHow can I do this? Do I need a static IP address or is there a way to dynamically forward traffic?\nThanks!\n\nA: *\n\n*You need to add an \"A\" record for linux.foo.com to the name servers for foo.com pointing to the public IP of your machine/home router. \n\n*If that public IP is dynamic, you need a tool and an interface (API) that will allow automatic updating; most name servers provided by domain-name resellers or hosting services don't have such dynamic DNS functionality, so you may be better off with a dynamic DNS service such as DynDNS. With a paid account, I believe they will let you use your own domain/subdomain. linux.foo.com with their name servers. \n\n*If your VM is connected in bridged mode, your router needs to be set up to forward port 22 to its internal IP. \n\n\n*\n\n*If it's in NAT, you need to configure vbox and the host to do this forwarding. \n\n\n", "Q: Unable to change display resolution I have a Dell laptop with a resolution of 1600 x 900 and I have a second monitor as Dell 24\".  The resolution that Ubuntu is configured in a virtual box is 1024 * 800.  How can I fix the resolution on the Dell monitor to get a higher resolution?\n\nA: It's most likely a limitation of your virtual machine's drivers, or at least the default installed ones. Check your video settings for the virtual machine. You may be able to try a different \"video card.\" Also, make sure \"Enable 3D acceleration\" is enabled in the virtual machine settings. Make sure to restart your virtual machine after any settings changes.\nAdditionally, you can try checking for drivers from within Ubuntu. Simply make sure apt-get is up to date, and check the \"Additional Drivers\" application to see if either have detected video drivers.\n", "Q: Left speaker dropouts in Ubuntu 12.04 I have the left speaker dropping out intermittently.  It seems to be occurring after a boatload of updates (including a kernel update) today.  I am sure it is Ubuntu problem and not a hardware fault because using another input device it works OK.  I can still hear a very faint sound from the left speaker, it is almost as if the balance is shifted very far to the right (but I checked that slider, it's in the center).  \n\nA: I think I'm experiencing the same. I'll put my hardware details below to make it easier for others to find this. Here is how I fix it: \nWhen the balance is shifted to the right, I hear only a very weak sound on the left side. I can take countermeasures by adjusting the balance in the sound-menu to the left. However, sometimes the left side is completely dead. I discovered that raising the volume dramatically brings the sound back on both sides. Same loudness on both ears. I have to move the slider for the volume at least 80% up (to the left). CAUTION: if you use headphones this will blow your drums. So better take them out. I need to do this for one second or so. Not longer. This is strange, it feels like something is stuck in a pipe and applying more pressure helps to push it through - although we are talking about drivers and hardware of a computer. Anyway, try it! I have not permanent fix. The balance shifts to left again after a reboot. Not always, but randomly. Then I just repeat the procedure. \nI also found out about Bug # 106945 which describes also a problem with the balance, but is from 2007 and obviously fixed. \n---- My hardware ---- \nlspci \n00:1b.0 Audio device: Intel Corporation 82801JD/DO (ICH10 Family) HD Audio Controller (rev 02) \n\nlshw \ndescription: Audio device product: 82801JD/DO (ICH10 Family) \nHD Audio Controller vendor: Intel Corporation physical \nid: 1b \nbus info: pci@0000:00:1b.0 \nversion: 02 \nwidth: 64 bits \nclock: 33MHz \ncapabilities: pm msi pciexpress bus_master cap_list \nconfiguration: driver=snd_hda_intel latency=0 \nresources: irq:52 \nmemory:f7adc000-f7adffff\n\ncat /proc/asound/card... \ncat /proc/asound/card0/codec*\n\nCodec: Analog Devices AD1984A\nAddress: 2\nAFG Function Id: 0x1 (unsol 0)\nVendor Id: 0x11d4194a\nSubsystem Id: 0x10280420\nRevision Id: 0x100400\nNo Modem Function Group found \n... \n\n", "Q: Alternative screen lock out to Xscreensaver? In most operating systems like Windows this was a nice feature, that when I walked away from the computer for the set amount of time - lets say 15 minutes - it would go into suspend.  When I would press the power button it would bring me to the main \"greeter\" log in screen instead of having me enter a password at the screen saver.

The preferences are set to allow different layouts for individual windows and to open new windows with the default layout, but it doesn't work that way, and it's a little hard to explain exactly what happens. Sometimes it switches the layout to all windows. sometimes it opens a new window, shows the previously active layout (rather than the default), then when you minimize the window and maximize it again, it's on the right layout. Sometimes it displays that one layout is selected, but the actual typing is in the other layout.\nI believe that there are separate and overlapping problems in the keyboard layout settings and the keyboard layout indicator. They do not seem to communicate and work together properly, and the result is very confusing.\nI'm certain this is a bug, and I'd report it, except I'm not sure about two things: one, whether there's already such a bug report or not. I've been searching one for a while, and I remember seeing something, only I can't find it now. Two, which packages are responsible for the keyboard layout, that is, which packages should be reported. Has anyone seen this before? Found something on Launchpad? Has a fix? If not, what packages are likely to cause this?\n\nA: After messing around a bit, I realized the difference between keyboard layout and keyboard input methods. I removed the Hebrew keyboard layout, thus removing the layout indicator from the panel. I installed m17n for Ibus, and that gave me the option to select a Hebrew input method. I changed the activation of Ibus to Shift+Alt, and disabled having the same input for all applications. \nIt works exactly as \nI want it now. It's unfortunate that I had to do all this research to get such a simple function to work properly. The keyboard layout switcher should be fixed to behave according to the preferences. It will solve a lot of problems.

I followed some instructions online, created a key, but coz I encountered some problems I decided to delete the key and restart the proces. (This fact is probably irrelevant, because I got similar errors when doing it.)\nNow I have no key and I go to Remote: Sync and publish keys. Firstly it says that there are 6 keys selected for synchronisation. Why? I do have some passwords saved in here, will it sync those too??\nAnd last, when I click sync I first get two errors:\n\nCouldn't retrieve keys from server: pool.sks-keyservers.net\nCouldn't communicate with server 'pool.sks-keyservers.net': Internal Server Error\n\nand\n\nCouldn't retrieve keys from server: keyserver.ubuntu.com:11371\nCouldn't communicate with server 'keyserver.ubuntu.com:11371': Internal Server Error\n\nThan the progress stops and no progress is made, it just says:\n\nSynchronising keys...

I fixed it by:\n\n\n*\n\n*Remove all existing keyservers from the Sync box (by default hkp://keyserver.ubuntu.com:11371, hkp://pool.sks-keyservers.net, and ldap://keyserver.pgp.com).\n\n*Add them over again (keeping the same settings).\n\n*Press Sync.\n\n\nDon't know why this works, but it does.\n\nA: Another workaround is to go directly to https://keyserver.ubuntu.com/ and submit the ASCII-armored version of your key.\nYou can generate it like this:\ngpg --armor --export $your.email.address@foo.com\n\n\nA: Try this solution from ubuntuforums. http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=1726418\ngpg --gen-key --enable-dsa2\n\nHope this helps!\n", "Q: Taking KDE config files with me I'm reinstalling my Kubuntu 12.04 and I want to take my Kate, Kile, Okular, Dolphin & Konsole config files with me.\nWhere are this files located?

You just need to ask the command for an interactive shell.\nLet's say your alias is:\nalias myalias='some cool command here'\n\nYour shortcut command must be:\nbash -i -c \"myalias\"\n\n\n\nA: No, the commands run by keyboard bindings are not parsed via a shell.

Hello i was always using ubuntu from 10.04 and now i have 12.04..\nAny version from 10.04 to 12.04 had appeared with many problems with ubuntu.. \nProblems like, in 12.04 the sleep fuction when the laptop is reopened shows a black screen and i have to crash my laptop\nYoutube was showing videos but faces of humans were in blue.. I have found here a solution from here. Now another problem appeared which i can't explain or screenshot it. It like the video playing inside the video.\nAnother problem is that i had maaaany times problems with booting ubuntu.. LIke more than 10 times i have googled a solution so as to boot my ubuntu..\nChromium opens after 10 seconds ( my friend's laptop opens in 2-3 )\nWhile on the other hand my friend using ubuntu from 9.04 he has like 0 problems..\nSo my question is this, can the hardware cause all of these problems?\n\nA: The short answer - yes, hardware may be to blame for some, most, or all of these problems.\nHowever, it's not necessarily the hardware that's the issue. For example, your \"blue faces\" thing isn't a hardware issue, nor is it even an \"Ubuntu\" issue, but a bug in the Flash player software. Your \"video in video\" thing would really need a screenshot for anyone to be able to help with (why can't you screen shot it?).\nAdditionally, the sleep function may be an issue with the kernel version (there's a known bug in the 3.2 version of the Linux Kernel that can cause issues such as what you're seeing). Or, it may be an issue with the driver for your particular video card model. Or, your video card itself may be going bad (which could also explain things like Flash issues).\nOr, your motherboard could be going bad (which could explain pretty much all of your issues).\nIn general, figuring out whether it's hardware or software depends entirely on your setup, and doesn't really matter whether it's a laptop or desktop (other than that you're more limited on your hardware selection with a laptop). For example, are you dual-booting with Windows? If so, then that may be why you can't boot into Ubuntu (I've seen an issue where Windows and Linux don't agree about the exact date/time, and when Windows is running fast, Linux sees disk writes as \"in the future\" and freaks out). Conversely, if you do dual-boot, and Chrome/Chromium takes forever to load on both partitions, then it may be a hardware issue (since it's on program load, it's most likely a lack of memory, but it could also be that your hard drive is going bad).\nIf you're looking for actionable help on any of the issues that you're having, you're going to have to provide quite a bit more information. What are your hardware specs (and/or what is your laptop model)? Are you dual-booting with another OS? If so, what's the other version of the OS (ie - Mac OS 10.5, Windows XP, Windows 7 64-bit, etc)? Is your Ubuntu a fresh install (vs an upgrade from an older version of Ubuntu)? Is it an install from WUBI (vs an install via booting to the disk)? What version of Ubuntu are you on? How do your specs compare to your friend's? What did you do prior to trying to boot into Ubuntu (and/or, what did you do before you last shut down Ubuntu)?\n", "Q: iball 3.75G-72 connect mobile broadband USB modem not detected in Ubuntu 12.04. how to detect that modem?

The VPN connection is configured trough network-manager-vpnc-gnome. All clients (separate user names and passwords, same group name and password) connect fine, get issued a 10.77.22.x IP and are able to access the web server on same network.\nNow here comes the fun part. Although all clients can get web pages from said server, SOME of them can't post page updates (like, user fills out text boxes, clicks save/submit). Furthermore, if the web page with editable content is in the main browser window, it works on all clients. If the page is in a pop-up window, the page doesn't get posted.\nTried this with Chrome and Firefox, both latest versions. Tried it without any extensions enabled, incognito/private mode. All clients run Ubuntu 11.10, all up to date and all of them run the same Firefox, Chrome and vpnc versions. \nI haven't got admin access to the Cisco box. The same two clients can't update pages regardless of their location (different routers, cable, adsl, etc.) while all others can regardless of location.\nSo, I realize there's no ready-made answer to this, I'd appreciate some pointers as to how to debug/monitor traffic on a \"healthy\" machine and then compare it to the \"faulty\" ones.\n\nA: Alright, hope someone finds this useful and doesn't have to spend hours trying to figure it out. The two clients in question were fixed after lowering their MTU to 1200 (1300 worked but had one hiccup while connecting from a coffee shop, so left it at 1200 for both).

I have an Asus USB Wi-Fi card, which is significantly better and works fine.\nWhat I'd like to do is disable the built-in Wi-Fi card.\nIs there a way to do this without having to boot into BIOS each time I want to disable/enable the built-in wireless?\nHere is the lsusb output:\nBus 001 Device 001: ID 1d6b:0002 Linux Foundation 2.0 root hub\nBus 002 Device 001: ID 1d6b:0002 Linux Foundation 2.0 root hub\nBus 003 Device 001: ID 1d6b:0001 Linux Foundation 1.1 root hub\nBus 004 Device 001: ID 1d6b:0001 Linux Foundation 1.1 root hub\nBus 005 Device 001: ID 1d6b:0001 Linux Foundation 1.1 root hub\nBus 006 Device 001: ID 1d6b:0001 Linux Foundation 1.1 root hub\nBus 007 Device 001: ID 1d6b:0001 Linux Foundation 1.1 root hub\nBus 002 Device 002: ID 0b05:179d ASUSTek Computer, Inc. \nBus 002 Device 004: ID 05a9:2640 OmniVision Technologies, Inc.

See my BrosTrendWifiAdapterSoftware repo here. See also my other answer here.\nHow to enable/disable networking (ethernet or wifi) devices, arbitrarily\n\nHow to disable built-in wifi and use only USB wifi card?\n\n\n*\n\n*Unplug your external USB wifi adapter.\n\n*Run iwconfig to see what your built-in adapter looks like. Mine shows wlan0. So, that is my built-in wifi adapter!\n\n*Now plug in your external USB wifi adapter and run iwconfig again to see which device just showed up. This new device showing up in iwconfig is what you just plugged in, so we can know it is the external USB wifi adapter. Mine shows wlan3.\n\n*Run the following to disable the internal wifi adapter, wlan0:\n# recommended (newer cmd)\nsudo ip link set wlan0 down\n# alternative (apparently an older cmd)\nsudo ifconfig wlan0 down\n\n\n\n*Done!\n\n*If you ever wanted to re-enable your internal wifi card, wlan0 as we discovered above, run:\n# recommended (newer cmd)\nsudo ip link set wlan0 up\n# alternative (apparently an older cmd)\nsudo ifconfig wlan0 up\n\n\nReferences:\n\n*\n\n*This ifconfig answer by Gerhard Burger\n\n*NOTE: Apparently this ip link set command is intended to replace the older (and apparently/supposedly now-deprecated?) ifconfig cmd! See: https://www.redhat.com/sysadmin/ifconfig-vs-ip --> in the sections \"What's trending?\" and \"Enable and disable an interface\".\n\nSee also:\n\n*\n\n*My other answer here: How to disable built-in wifi and use only USB wifi card?.\n\n*[my answer] Unix & Linux Stack Exchange: \"How can I create a virtual ethernet interface on a machine without a physical adapter?\"\n\nA: Add the following line to /etc/network/interfaces:\niface wlan0 inet manual\n\nNetworkManager doesn't manage interfaces configured in the interfaces file. Replace wlan0 with the interface you want to disable, if it's not the name of the built-in interface.\nThen restart network manager:\nsudo service network-manager restart\n\n\nA: Connect the USB Wi-Fi dongle and disable the internal Wi-Fi adapter as below:\n\n*\n\n*Identify your adapter's name by:\nip link | grep wl\n\nor:\nifconfig | grep wl\n\nThe adapter's name should be something similar to wlp2s0 or wlan0, in which the digits in the names could be any number in your case.\n\n\n*Disable the adapter by:\nsudo ip link set wlp2s0 down\n\nor:\nsudo ifconfig wlan0 down\n\nIn your case replace the adapter's name respectively.\nThis will ensure that only the USB Wi-Fi adapter is active even though the internal Wi-Fi driver will still be active.\n\nALTERNATIVELY\nDisable the internal Wi-Fi driver module:\nsudo modprobe -r iwlmvm\n\nThis will ensure that only the USB Wi-Fi dongle is active.\n\nA: Most laptops these days have Intel wireless cards, which you can very easily disable using the command:\nsudo modprobe -r iwlwifi\n\nor disable and blacklist permanently using:\nsudo modprobe -r iwlwifi; sudo modprobe -b iwlwifi\n\nI do this with my laptop to use my high-gain TP-Link adapter instead of the internal Wi-Fi card.\n\nA: The built in wifi is Broacom's BCM4312, which uses the proprietary STA driver. So, no need to blacklist anything in your particular case, just deactivate the driver, using the Additional Drivers utility. \n\nA: I think the easiest way to do this is with ifconfig.\nEDIT 2021-03-02:\nApparently, if you're still using ifconfig you're living in the past, so have a look at Gabriel's answer below for an ip solution. Read below for the old ifconfig solution.\n\nifconfig solution:\nRun\nifconfig\n\nthen look at which adapter you want to turn off, in my case wlan1 is my internal wifi and wlan2 is my usb wifi.\nThen run\nsudo ifconfig wlan1 down\n\nand it will turn off (type ifconfig to check, note that in the network manager the adapter still shows, but it is turned off). To turn it on again:\nsudo ifconfig wlan1 up\n\nand that's it.\n\nA: To blacklist the module of your wireless card:\n\n\n*\n\n*sudo vi /etc/modprobe.d/blacklist.conf (or create a custom one)\n\n*Uncomment the module name that has a #  in the beginning of the line:\nblacklist eth1394\n\n\n*Save, run sudo update-initramfs -u and reboot\nTo remove a module manually without rebooting:\nsudo modprobe -r eth1394\n\nLooses effect after reboot.\nTo load the module:\nsudo modprobe eth1394\n\nTo see modules loaded:\nsudo lsmod\n\n\nA: I usually physically remove the internal card. this is usually a mini PCI-e card with 1 or 2 antenna connections. the antenna connections can be carefully lifted up and they disconnect without any fuss. there will usually be 1 Phillips screw holding the card in place. once the screw is removed, lift the back of the card and slide it out of it's edge connector. i usually fold electrical (vinyl) tape over the antenna wire connectors and push the screw through the electrical tape. then re-install the screw (thus holding the antenna wires in their former place). this solves the problem of an undesired internal wireless quite nicely. \nnote that some cards also include Bluetooth and this procedure removes such Bluetooth as well.\nalso note that with usb radios, the radio must be turned off before unplugging the radio. on some operating systems, the system crashes if the radio is unplugged before being turned off in the operating system (while still booted).\n\nA: I just found out that Trend-tech, who makes the BrosTrend AC1200 2.4GHz/5GHz WiFi adapter which I document in my repo here, recommends the following.\nFrom: https://deb.trendtechcn.com/advanced/internal-adapters/:\n\nInternal adapters\nNormally it should be possible for many wifi adapters to coexist, both internal and external ones. Unfortunately some of our customers have reported that they had connectivity issues that were resolved when they disabled their internal adapter. This may be caused by a bug in the Linux kernel, in wpa_supplicant, in network-manager or elsewhere. It’s probably not caused by our driver, as these problems happen with other USB adapters as well.\nTo temporarily disable your internal adapter and see if it makes things better, please open a terminal and follow the procedure below. Note that for Raspberry Pi devices, this procedure is recommended instead.\nThe following command shows the names of the modules (drivers) for your wifi adapters. The module for our adapters is named 8812au, 88x2bu or 8821cu. The module for Intel adapters is named iwlwifi. For Atheros it’s ath9k, etc.\nls -d /sys/module/cfg80211/holders/*/drivers | cut -d/ -f6\n# Example output:\n88x2bu\niwlwifi\n\nIn the following commands, replace iwlwifi with the module that you want to blacklist:\nsudo -i\necho \"blacklist iwlwifi\" > /etc/modprobe.d/local.conf\nupdate-initramfs -u\nreboot\n\nAfter rebooting, the internal adapter should be disabled. Also, if you have more than one USB wifi adapters, remove the additional ones. Check if things work better that way.\nIf you ever need to remove the blacklist, use the following commands:\nsudo -i\nrm /etc/modprobe.d/local.conf\nupdate-initramfs -u\nreboot\n\n\nIn a personal email to me from their Linux support team (who actually does seem to know what they are talking about, which is awesome!), they also said:\n\nThe network manager nm-connection-editor dialog (run that from a\nterminal to see which one I mean) has a \"Device\" combo box, where you\ncan set a MAC address in order to limit one wifi connection to a\nspecific adapter, or you can leave it empty if you want it to work with\nany adapter.\nSo normally there's no need to disable the internal adapter at all.\n\nThat also looks pretty relevant and does seem to work.\nSee also:\n\n*\n\n*My other answer here: How to disable built-in wifi and use only USB wifi card?.\n\n\nA: I know the answer was strictly \"How to disable\" but for most users like me who have searched this and haven't taken a networking course before ( or in my case 10 years ), the easiest way to \"Get this thing working on my Ubuntu\" is to just click the wifi icon at the top right of the screen and look for your usb wifi-receiver and connect it to a network.  Make sure it connects so you know the drivers are working, and then disconnect the old one ( probably connected through pci ).\nIf you bought your usb wireless card through a third party vendor, there's a 99% chance that the card will not show up under the name of that vendor, ie \"Joes Hardware on Amazon\" or \"Brostrend\" or whatever.  It will most likely be the name of the actual hardware inside the casing of the thing you bought, and that will probably be Realtek or Intel or something.  So look for one of those names in the dropdown wifi menu.\nIf you need to find the name of your built in wifi, just run:\nsudo lshw -C network\n\nand look for:\ndescription: Wireless interface\nand\nbus info: pci@0000:03:00.0\nand\nproduct: Centrino Advanced-N 6205 [Taylor Peak]\nThat's the one you want to disbale in the dropdown menu.  Whether or not your system will keep the old crappy wifi disabled after you reboot your machine is another story.  Good Luck!\n\nA: Network manager has a little-known command-line interface called nmcli. If all you want is for the network manager not to manage the interface, you can run:\nnmcli device set <interface-name> managed no\n\nTo list the possible interface names, use:\nip link\n\nIf that list doesn't give you enough information to work out which one you want to disable, you can use:\nsudo lshw -C network\n\n\nA: I tried all of this on Ubuntu 20.04 and none of it worked. When I tried the modprobe solution network manager simply created a new device! So finally I simply unplugged the tiny little wifi card from the motherboard and that worked. If you can't solve it in software try this hardware solution.\n\nA: I had the same problem. I wanted to connect a USB Wifi card to my home network.\nUnder Ubuntu 20.04 the solution is to modify the \"interface-name\" parameter in the network connection file.\nUnder Ubuntu 20.04 all the network connection files containing which network card (WIFI or Ethernet) is assigned to which network are located under /etc/NetworkManager/system-connections/\nThe parameter \"interface-name\" is at the top of connection file\nAs an exemple here are the network connections I have on my laptop\nls -l /etc/NetworkManager/system-connections/\n-rw------- 1 root root 350 oct.  15 17:38 wiseDom.nmconnection\n-rw------- 1 root root 350 oct.  15 16:44 wiseDom.nmconnection-old\n-rw------- 1 root root 364 avril  3  2022 WIZEDOMWIFI.nmconnection\n-rw------- 1 root root 350 oct.  13 19:18 WIZEDOMWIFI.nmconnection-old\n\nOn my laptop the name of the on-board WIFI adapter (listed with usr/sbin/ifconfig) is: wlp3s0\nand the name of the USB WIFI adapter is: wlx54af97552ea2\nFollowing on my exemple here is what was assigned to the \"interface-name\" parameter in my old connection file:\ncat /etc/NetworkManager/system-connections/wiseDom.nmconnection-old |grep \"interface-name\"\ninterface-name=wlp3s0\n\nand to use the USB WIFI card (wlx54af97552ea2) I modified it to be:\ninterface-name=wlx54af97552ea2\n\n", "Q: How to set static routes in Ubuntu Server? I have used Ubuntu since Ubuntu 8.10; today I'm working with Ubuntu 12.04 Server. \nI am having difficulty keeping static routes on booting. I would usually put the route commands \n/sbin/route add -net <IP>/<MASK> <GW> dev <ethX>\n\nin /etc/rc.local or I would create a file (named routes) inside the directory /etc/network/if-up/, but I notice that on Ubuntu 12.04 it isn't working.  \nIf I type the commands in the shell, they work, but the same commands don't work when they  are in the specified file. \nI already tried to change the file name to other names thinking that my file name (routes) could be erroneous in Ubuntu 12.04, but that also did not work.\nI notice also that command /sbin/ifconfig works, less the /sbin/route.\nWhat changed in network set-up?\nHow can I define static routes on Ubuntu 12.04?\n\nA: You can try this (add it to /etc/network/interfaces), this is almost complete way for setting routes:\nauto eth0\niface eth0 inet static\n    post-up /sbin/route add -net 192.168.0.0 netmask 255.255.0.0 gw 192.168.1.1\n    post-up /bin/mount -t nfs 192.168.0.203:/motd/ /motd/\n\n\nA: You can put static routes in /etc/network/interfaces:\nauto eth0\niface eth0 inet static\n      address 192.168.1.2\n      netmask 255.255.255.0\n      up route add -net 192.168.0.0 netmask 255.255.0.0 gw 192.168.1.1\n      up route add -net 172.16.0.0 netmask 255.240.0.0 gw 192.168.1.1\n\n\nA: As it is 2021 you can config it using netplan on ubuntu 18.04 or later (tested on ubuntu 20.04).\ncompelete reference is available on netplan site.\nthe config file can be found under /etc/netplan/ directory.\nnetwork:\n  version: 2\n  ethernets:\n    ens160: # in my case the interface name is ens160\n      dhcp4: false  # or true. depends on your situation\n      addresses: [192.168.0.10/24]  # your static IP address\n      # the actual answer is here\n      routes:\n        - to: 0.0.0.0/0  # or any other subnet you like. 0.0.0.0/0 means default gateway\n          via: 172.16.0.1  # or any other gateway you want.\n          on-link: true   # as you see my interface IP address and default gateway are not in the same subnet so we should put this true but if they are in the same subnet this is not required. \n\n\nPS. the YAML configuration files are sensitive to indentation and it does not accept tabs. the indentation is 2 spaces.\ndon't forget run netplan apply.\n\nA: There is a package ifupdown-extra avaible in Ubuntu.\nIt provides automatic scripts (installed in /etc/network/*/), one of which is used to add static routes.\nThe configuration file for this is  /etc/network/routes\nThe top of this config file has a good description:\n\nThis configuration file is read by the static-routes if-updown script\n  and the /etc/init.d/networking-routes script to setup a list of routes\n  associated either with a given interface or global routes.\n\nAn example route I use is:\n192.168.240.0 255.255.255.0 192.168.130.3 em3\n\n\nA: Using nmcli I was able to run a persistent solution (@isapir solution didn't work on my device).\nsudo nmcli connection modify <conection-name> +ipv4.routes \"<ip>/<mask> <gw> <mt>\"\n\nFor example:\nsudo nmcli connection modify ssid-name +ipv4.routes \"1.1.1.0/24 192.168.0.1 100\"\n\nAfter that applying the changes is possible by setting the connection down and up again (no need for full NetworkManager restart):\nsudo nmcli con down ssid-name ; sudo nmcli con up ssid-name\n\nTo see current connections run:\nsudo nmcli connection\n\n\nA: what worked for us was\nsudo route add -net 192.168.0.2/32 gw 192.168.1.1 netmask 255.255.0.0\n\ni used to run on a Mac:\nsudo route -n add -net 192.168.0.2/32 192.168.1.1\n\nbut on a ubuntu the \"gw\" between IPs and the last \"netmask\" part was missing (also -n not required on ubuntu)\n\nA: I prefer to use nmcli.\nnmcli device modify <device> +ipv4.routes \"<ip>/<mask> <gw>\" ipv4.route-metric 0\n\nFor example:\nnmcli device modify wlp2s0 +ipv4.routes \"1.1.1.0/24 192.168.0.1\" ipv4.route-metric 0\n\nAfter that apply the changes by restarting the NetworkManager service:\nsudo systemctl restart NetworkManager.service\n\n\nA: I found very often that the correct place to define a static route is in /etc/network/interfaces,  it is ok if you are going to globally restart the network with /etc/init.d/networking restart for example. But if you are going to use ifdown and ifup to individually shutdown an interface, ifup will end with the error:\nifup eth1\n\nRTNETLINK answers: File exists\nFailed to bring up eth1.\n\nBecause of it tries to define a route but it is already defined. The interface will be up anyway but, ifup will not update /run/network/ifstate so next time you will us ifdown you will not able to do it unless you use the --force flag.\nTo make ifup to continue configuring even if routes are already defined, you can use this format when defining routes in /etc/network/interfaces\nup ip route add 172.16.0.0/24 via 192.168.10.1 || true\nup ip route add 192.168.0.0/16 via 192.168.10.1 || true\n\nThis way you will have the warning in the output but the interface configuration will be completed\nifup eth1\n\nRTNETLINK answers: File exists\nRTNETLINK answers: File exists\nssh stop/waiting\nssh start/running, process 18553\n\n", "Q: How can I install Ubuntu on a IBM ThinkPad with a USB? \nPossible Duplicate:\nHow do I install Ubuntu to a USB key? \n\nI would like to know the steps to follow to install Ubuntu on a IBM ThinkPad with a USB please.

Try 'apt-get -f install'  with no packages (or specify a solution\n\nI tried using apt-get -f to install, but it didn't work.\nHow can I fix it?\n\nA: What I see there is that the flashplugin-installer package had some kind of downloading or installing problem and it is not letting you install vim. What I suggest is remove the flashplugin package, then do a refresh of the repository cache and then download vim. Afterwards just install flash again, although I recommend doing it via the restricted extras. Something like the following:\nsudo apt-get remove flashplugin-installer\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get install vim\nsudo apt-get install ubuntu-restricted-extras\n\nOn another note I actually still recommend using aptitude over apt-get.

I just have managed to install Lubuntu 12.04. Now I want to do some things in the terminal like installing and configuring the Apache and a Lamp-system among other things.\nI come from Open SUSE world and there, I usually get access to the super-user-mode in the terminal by typing the command su.\nBut if I do that in Lubuntu, I am asked for the password and when I enter my password that I use to access the system, I get this error message (translated from German):\nsu: error with the Authentication \n\nWhat should I do now?\n\nA: If you want to do root operations you can: \n\n\n*\n\n*Use sudo with your user password, and you can do everything that root user do. \n\n*Use sudo su with your user password to obtain root access \n\n*Use sudo passwd with that command are changing the root password, then you can easily access root user using su like other distros (and you can continue to use also sudo). \n\n\nA: Because you don't enable root account by default Ubuntu disable it. Enabling root by these commands:\n$ sudo passwd root\n[sudo] password for abc:\nEnter new UNIX password:\nRetype new UNIX password:\npasswd: password updated successfully\n\nand use su-  switch to root account\n\nA: Ubuntu uses sudo instead of an explicit root account. You can log in as root directly with sudo su, if that's more comfortable for you.\nSee Advantages and Disadvantages of sudo for why Ubuntu does this.\n\nA: Ubuntu uses sudo to elevate the current user's privileges instead of using actual root account. However, if you specifically require a root shell, you can execute sudo su.\n", "Q: error: no such partition. grub rescue I had multiboot windows 7 and ubuntu on my Samsung notebook NP305U1A-A07IN.

But I installed Ubuntu from USB itself and now it can't detect any of those. I don't want to lose any data. Anything will work Windows or Linux now. At least let me know the way I can bring windows installation on it.\n\nA: I don't think deleting all unnamed partitions from Windows is the right answer.\nYou should reinstall your GRUB to restore your boot menu. Check this question, it might be helpful. \n\nA: Faced this fearsome screen of death after installing 12.04 dual boot. Using 11.04 earlier on. Yeah, the windows stuff were still there. In the end, I solved the problem by installing 10.10 from CD to restore grub. Not touching 12.04 until this issue is stable. \n\nA: In my case the hard disks have been configured to work in IDE mode, which worked perfectly in Ubuntu 11.04.\nAfter installing Ubuntu 12.04, I got the \"no such partition\" error.\nI solved it by configuring the BIOS to work with disks in ACPI mode.\n\nA: You should change your boot priority to USB as first priority. If its not shown, this cannot be done unless you get the boot file from another computer and transfer it to your current one.\n", "Q: System volume setting muted when headphones unplugged, but normal with headphones in? My system volume is muted in general, but when I plug in my headphones, the volume gets set to about 50% of its range. If I change the system volume to another value, the volume still gets reset when I plug in my headphones. It is as if I have 2 distinct volume settings, the main one getting overridden by the other when headphones are plugged in. Is this normal behaviour? Is there a way I can change it so that volume is the same regardless of what is plugged in or not? \n\nA: Your pulseaudio server may try to restore settings of a device (in your case your headphones), which is generally a good idea.\nIn a default setup this is done by module-device-restore. You can test if this is so in your case by unloading this module. You will first have to find out the index number of the module-device-restore. Look for its index in the long list of modules loaded that will be displayed with\npacmd list-modules\n\nWe then can temporarily unload a module by replacing <index> with the one found above in the following command:\npacmd unload-module <index>\n\nWe then can see if the issue we are having is resolved. No harm done so far, the module will be loaded again with every restart of pulseaudio. \nTo avoid loading this module in case it undesiredly restores settings we may comment out the following line in /etc/pulse/default.pa:\n# load-module module-device-restore\n\nAlternatively we may also load this module with option restore_muted=false to avoid restoring the muted state or with option restore_volume=false to avoid restoring a volume. Note that then this will affect all audio devices in your system.\n", "Q: How can I have a shell for git like in Windows? When I use Windows, the shell (even a standard Windows shell) shows basic information about the git repository when you are in a git repository.  Things like the active branch and maybe some color coding.\nIs there a way to have the same in Ubuntu?\n\nA: The Windows Git shell, which is really just bash, sets the prompt $PS1 to a long string that includes $(__git_ps1).\n__git_ps1 is defined as a function, nearly 100 lines long, that prints the name of the current branch in parentheses.\n/etc/profile (which is C:\\Program Files (x86)\\Git\\etc\\profile, at least on my system)) invokes /etc/git-completion.bash, which defines the __git_ps1 function, sets $PS1, defines some git-specific completions, among other things.\nThe git-completion.bash used by Git Bash appears to be based on this.\n\nA: For color:\ngit config --global color.ui true\n\n\nA: If you use zsh as your shell, you might find my config files useful. Try source prompt/blocky to see what the prompt looks like in a Git repository.\n\nA: *\n\n*How to stop bash prompt colours from escaping has an example. You could copy it from the answer and then use gedit to paste it to the bottom of your the .bashrc file in your home directory (making a backup, first, of course). \n\n*If the .bashrc file Keith mentions in his answer is part of git it will be licensed with GPL2 so you should be free to past it into your .bashrc file as well. You'll have to grab the /etc/git-completion.bash file and install it somewhere too, and have your new .bashrc reference it.\n\n*Here's something else you could paste and try from Arturo Fernandez at http://www.bsnux.com/recipes/how-display-you-current-git-branch-prompt.html\n\n # Displaying git branch inside prompt\n function parse_git_branch {\n   git branch --no-color 2> /dev/null | sed -e '/^[^*]/d' -e 's/* \\(.*\\)/(\\1)/'\n }\n\n function proml {\n   local       GREEN=\"\\[\\033[0;32m\\]\"\n   local       WHITE=\"\\[\\033[0;37m\\]\"\n\n PS1=\"[\\u@\\h \\w$GREEN\\$(parse_git_branch)]$WHITE\\$ \"\n PS2='> '\n PS4='+ '\n}\nproml\n\n\nA: Here's how to add windows-like git-bash to Ubuntu terminal:\n\n*\n\n*Add to the end of ~/.bashrc:\nPS1='\\[\\033]0;$MSYSTEM:${PWD//[^[:ascii:]]/?}\\007\\]\\n\\[\\033[32m\\]\\u@\\h \\[\\033[35m\\]$MSYSTEM \\[\\033[33m\\]\\w\\[\\033[36m\\]`__git_ps1`\\[\\033[0m\\]\\n$ '\n\n*execute in terminal:\nsource ~/.bashrc\n", "Q: How can I automatically add meta-tags to screenshots? I was wondering if there is a way to automatically add a given meta-tag to the screenshots taken on pressing the print screen key.\nIt would really be a time saver because I upload many screenshots to my blog regularly. It will avert the need to add tags manually to all screenshots.\n\nA: You could map the keyboard shortcut of your choice to a (very) short script that goes something like:\n#!/bin/sh\nFILENAME=~/screenshot.jpg\nTAGSTRING=\"tag:screenshot\"\nKW=\"My keyword\"\n\nactiveWinLine=$(xprop -root | grep \"_NET_ACTIVE_WINDOW(WINDOW)\")\nactiveWinId=${activeWinLine:40}\nimport -window \"$activeWinId\" $FILENAME -comment $TAGSTRING\n\n# More advanced exif info:\nexiftool -keywords=$KW $FILENAME\n\nTo make this executable, save it as something like myscreenshot and then do\nchmod u+x myscreenshot\n\nPlacing it in your ~/bin/ directory and making sure that that is in your path means it will be executable from whatever directory it is called from. \nThen depending on your desktop environment you need to map whatever keyboard shortcut you like to the command myscreenshot.\nfor example in Gnome, select keyboard shortcuts from preferences, and assign a custom shortcut (you decide on the key combination) to the command myscreenshot. \nIf you didn't put the executable in a path on the PATH, then you would have to specify the full path in the command argument, such as '/home/USER/bin/./myscreenshot'\nNOTE\nThis takes a screenshot of the active window but can be easily modified to take a screenshot of the whole window if that's what you want. \nexiftool\nexiftool may also do what you want - perhaps giving more flexibility over the information to store than the comment string alone. \nFor example \nexiftool -keywords=one -keywords=two -keywords=twentythree FILENAME\n\nwill add the keywords one, two, and three to FILENAME. \nGUI alternative\nAlso TAGSTRING can either be set in the script file, or perhaps passed in using a simple zenity dialog, depending on if it will be the same each time or you need to be able to change it.\nAlternatively, shutter seems to have a lot of customization options (many more than the stock screen capture tool), including upload!

Is there a way to set the number of rows for desktop workspaces without using the xfce-panel applet \"Workspace Switcher\"?\nI don’t run xfce-panel at all, preferring to use cairo-dock.\n\nA: It's possible to manually set the _NET_DESKTOP_LAYOUT property using the xprop command.\nFor example, to get 4 columns x 2 rows, issue this:\nxprop -root -f _NET_DESKTOP_LAYOUT 32cccc -set _NET_DESKTOP_LAYOUT 0,4,2,0\n\nAnd to change the number of workspaces/desktops to 8:\nxprop -root -f _NET_NUMBER_OF_DESKTOPS 32c -set _NET_NUMBER_OF_DESKTOPS 8\n\nFurther information regarding the _NET_DESKTOP_LAYOUT property (among others) can be found here\n\nA: Since one of the comments above suggested that this feature was removed\nI searched through the settings and found a way without doing it manually.\nI am currently using Ubuntu 16.04.4LTS .\nWith a Rightclick on the the Workspace Switcher in one of the panels (see screenshot below) you can open the respective contex menu. From there you can choose Properties. The window is shown in the second screenshot below. Here you can choose a number of rows to be used for the \nworkspaces. The number of workspaces will then be distributed from top to bottom.\n\n\n\nA: Building off of Pierre's answer, once you've found the right layout, you should add the line to the end of your ~/.profile. \nFor instance, I prefer to have a 2x2 grid of workspaces, so I added this line to the end of my .profile:\nxprop -root -f _NET_DESKTOP_LAYOUT 32cccc -set _NET_DESKTOP_LAYOUT 0,2,2,0\n\nNow the grid should persist between logins.\nI'm running Xubuntu 14.04, and I've got to say it's so frustrating that they've removed easy access to this feature from the workspace settings.\n", "Q: Specifying a local iso to vmbuilder for KVM I am trying to specify a local .iso image of the Ubuntu OS I would like to use to create a virtual machine of. According to vmbuilder kvm ubuntu --help, (and this post) you are allowed to specify an .iso file instead of using a mirror.\nI have downloaded my own copy of Ubuntu Desktop 12.04 i386 from Ubuntu.com and tried to specify it like so\nvmbuilder kvm ubuntu --suite=precise --arch=i386 -o --flavour=server --iso=/home/fred/Desktop/ubuntu-12.04-desktop-i386.iso --libvirt=qemu:///system --ip=192.168.1.39 --gw=192.168.1.254 --part=vmbuilder.partition --templates=mytemplates --user=fred --name=fred --pass=password --mem=1024 --cpu=1 --hostname=vm1 --bridge=br0\n\nI have tried replacing --flavour=server with --flavour=desktop, --flavour=virtual and nothing at all.\nThe help command states\n--iso=PATH       This requires suite and\n                 kernel parameter to match what is available on the\n                 iso, obviously.\n\nwhich makes me think I could be getting the --flavour or --suite option wrong though I don't understand how or why.\nI ran it with the --debug command and pasted the output on pastebin here. Mainly it's failing to create the image because:\nFailure trying to run: chroot /tmp/tmp6UfExa mount -t proc proc /proc\n\n\nA: This could be a very local issue (ie something quirky on your machine). I had a similar issue and it was to do with a type on one of the switches and not a mounting issue at all. But...\nIf you're running 12.04 yourself you shouldn't need to specif the iso. You have already told the application you want to install the 'precise' suite (ie 12.04) and you should probably --flavour=virtual (that's the joy of vmbuilder - no need to download the isos if you just want Ubuntu. Try simplifying your command even if it creates an image you late have to delete because it is unusable or not enough memory. You can start with something as simple as\nvmbuilder kvm ubuntu\n\nand if you want it 'virsh'-compatible or specify memory etc then yes add the appropriate switch:\nvmbuilder kvm ubuntu --suite=precise --mem=1024 --flavour=virtual -o --libvirt qemu:///system --user=admin --pass=myPassw0rd\n\nI also find that despite configuring things in what I believe is the same way, I sometimes find I have to move my image files to a different directory in /var/lib/libvirt.\nAdd the bridge, --addpkg acpid (if you want to be able to shutdown an ubuntu instance correctly, openssh-server is good too allowing you to access the machine other than via VNC/screen scraping.\nEnjoy\n", "Q: Installing GTK dev environment with aptitude I'm trying to install the GTK development environment on Ubuntu, and having difficulty simply get it installed.\nBasically, my goal is to simply compile a C file which includes the header file <gtk/gtk.h>, so I can start tinkering around:\n#include <gtk/gtk.h>\n\nint main() { }\n\nSo, this answer says you can simply apt-get install gnome-core-devel build-essential to get the development environment installed.  Okay, so I tried that and when I try to compile the above code, I get, the compiler complains it can't find the file gtk/gtk.h\nSo, I add /usr/include/gtk-2.0/ to the Path and compile again.  Now it complains that it can't find another file /gio/gio.h.\nThis file didn't even exist on my system, so after googling around for gio.h, and apt-getting other libraries, I managed to install it.  I tried compiling again, this time the compiler can't find /usr/include/glib-2.0/glib/gtypes.h. \nAt this point, I'm thinking it can't possibly be this difficult to simply install something like GTK development enviroment, which is a fairly popular package.  I thought maybe something was wrong with my system, so I tried this on a different install of Ubuntu, and ran into the same issues.\nSo, what exact packages are necessary to install GTK?  And will I need to manually configure my include path, or is that supposed to happen automatically?\n\nA: There are two versions of GTK+, gtk+2 and gtk+3. You should choose or at least prefer gtk+3, as the transition has began some time ago.\nThere are some examples for gtk3 here: http://developer.gnome.org/gtk3/3.2/gtk-getting-started.html\n#include <gtk/gtk.h>\n\nint\nmain (int   argc,\nchar *argv[])\n{\n  GtkWidget *window;\n\n  gtk_init (&argc, &argv);\n\n  window = gtk_window_new (GTK_WINDOW_TOPLEVEL);\n\n  g_signal_connect (window, \"destroy\", G_CALLBACK (gtk_main_quit), NULL);\n\n  gtk_widget_show (window);\n\n  gtk_main ();\n\n  return 0;\n}\n\nTo find which package provides a file, head to http://packages.ubuntu.com and scroll down to \"Search the contents of packages\". Enter the file name as keyword and search for the file.\ngtk.h is provided by two packages:\n\n/usr/include/gtk-2.0/gtk/gtk.h    libgtk2.0-dev\n/usr/include/gtk-3.0/gtk/gtk.h    libgtk-3-dev\n\nInstall libgtk-3-dev for gtk+3.\nFinally, mind the command you execute (see the examples from the link I mentioned above):\ngcc `pkg-config --cflags gtk+-3.0` -o window-default window-default.c `pkg-config --libs gtk+-3.0`\n\nKeep the order of the arguments the same. You may want to add -Wall to show any errors that need to be fixed:\ngcc `pkg-config --cflags gtk+-3.0` -o window-default window-default.c -Wall `pkg-config --libs gtk+-3.0`\n\nIf you're still facing problems, show/attach the command you use and the output provided to your question above.\n", "Q: How to use a real partition with Windows 7 installed, in a virtualbox vm? My Ubuntu 12.04 is installed on /dev/sda5  and Windows 7 on /dev/sda1.  When I am running Ubuntu, I would like to use Virtualbox to run Windows 7 in a VM. The Windows 7 partition is 1 TB and is half full, i.e. large, so I don't want to copy it into a virtual hard disk.\nI have read that it is possible to use a real hard disk for a Virtualbox VM, but the various instructions I have found differ from each other, and I can't seem to get it to work.  Does anyone know a way to make it work in Ubuntu 12.04 and Virtualbox 2.1.12_Ubuntu r77245 (the latest Ubuntu installed the repos)?   \nPlease post how it works for you as I want to retry any method that might work.\n\nA: The command you want is\nVBoxManage internalcommands createrawvmdk -filename Win7.vmdk -rawdisk /dev/sda -partitions 1\n\nThis will create a special VMDK virtual disk file (Win7.vmdk) which is actually a pointer to the host disk partition /dev/sda1.\nIn theory, you can then use this as the disk file for a VM to run directly from the actual disk partition, but...\n\n\n*\n\n*(a) I've never tried this, so don't know how reliable it is \n\n*(b) you may get problems with Windows Activation depending on your license key and whether Windows decides that the detected 'hardware' has significantly changed\n\n\nA: Yes you can do that with the internal createrawvmdk command, which will not create an entire disk image, but a pointer to the actual hardware.\nThere are two ways to do that\n\n\n*\n\n*A. Full disk image (of /dev/sdb)\nsudo VBoxManage internalcommands createrawvmdk -filename sdb.vmdk -rawdisk /dev/sdb\n\n\n*B. Partition image\nAs @StarNamer showed, you ca use only one or few partitions.\nTo create image of just one (/dev/sda1) partition:\nsudo VBoxManage internalcommands createrawvmdk -filename sda1.vmdk -rawdisk /dev/sda -partitions 1\n\nTo create custom partition table which will map /dev/sda2 and /dev/sda1 in that order:\nsudo VBoxManage internalcommands createrawvmdk -filename sda2_1.vmdk -rawdisk /dev/sda -partitions 2,1\n\nMost striking difference will be that full disk image will use bootloader and partition table exactly as they are in your disk, so in theory (I did that previously only in qemu) you will be able to setup OS from your virtual machine. And from my limited experience I can say that full disk image will work exactly as qemu -hda /dev/sdb.\nNote: If you're using user to access the disk, you need to add it to disk and vboxusers groups, e.g.\nsudo usermod -aG disk,vboxusers ubuntu\n\nthen make sure you re-login or restart your computer.\nFurther reading:\n\n\n*\n\n*VirtualBox documentation: Using a raw host hard disk from a guest\n\n*VirtualBox boots only in UEFI Interactive shell (just including the ESP for UEFI installs will not work)\n\n*Install the Windows MBR bootloader (temporarily) from within Ubuntu (1, 2).\n\n*Better, you can install MBR into a file and use the -mbr option (see 1) when creating the VMDK.\n\n*If you've got VERR_ACCESS_DENIED error, check: Virtualbox doesn't work with a real partition.\n\n\nA: There is an Disk option called \"Immutable\", so in theory if you select this option for the vmdk linking to your raw disk, it should not change the original partition. \nTo do so open \"Virtual Media Manager\" found under \"File\", select your image and click \"Modify\" (You have to make sure this image is not attached to any machine, otherwise you get an error). Now you can set the media type to \"Immutable\". \nI have not tested this, though. If anyone does (of course with a test setup) it would be good to report back here. \nHas anyone considerations which speak against this idea?\n\nA: For several years now, I have been running dual-booted Windows and Ubuntu with the Ubuntu Partition also booting into Windows VirtualBox to take advantage of the touch-screen capabilities that Linux hasn't yet mastered.\nI set it up with instructions similar to below;\n\n\n*\n\n*How to Dual Boot and Virtualize the Same Partition on Your Computer\nThe new machines can simultaneously handle both OSs better than single systems on old machines.\nDownside: You need to save the instructions you use for setup in case an update disables the VirtualBox connection (my current problem).\n\nA: After many tries I ended up with a neat and clean solution:\n\n\n*\n\n*Boot the windows partition you would like to virtualize\n\n*Download Disk2VHD utility from Sysinternals\n\n*If you have a UEFI partition, follow these instructions\n\n*Create a VHD (not VHDX) image of your C: partition, recovery, UEFI (if any) and whatever else you want\n\n*Come back to Linux, open VirtualBox and create a VM accordingly to your windows operating system specifications\n\n*Attach to that VM the VHD disk created at point 4\n\n*That's it\n\n*Profit\n\n\nTroubleshooting in case of UEFI:\n\n\n*\n\n*In the VM settings, in VirtualBox, check the option \"Enable EFI\" under System tab\n\n*If you get stuck at the EFI Shell, run the following command:\nfs0:\\EFI\\Boot\\bkpbootx64.efi\n\n\nA: VirtualBox has lot of disadvantages. I leave it some years ago. Now I use qemu-kvm and beside other fine feature it can be configured to use the disk device in the same way as the disk image. The trick is to configure the virtual \"-drive if=sd,id=sda,format=raw,file=/dev/sda\" . \nBut! You must first make some changes while running the MSW on the bare metal, before you try to virtualise it: look at \"Drivers\" folder for the proper drivers to be present and the \"Registry\" tree to be those drivers enabled and set to be run prior the system start like: \n[HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\\SYSTEM\\ControlSet001\\services\\msahci] \"Start\"=dword:00000000\n\nYou have to look for apropriet driver with respect to the virtual machine if you do not want to see the BSOD.\nIt is hard to say which drivers to activate. The best way is to install a test system first, then search register in it for register key with the \"Start\"=dword:00000000 and then set these key on the bare metal machine. It is also recomended to check the MAC address on the bare metal to put it in the qemu configuration. You can prevent the system to ask for new activation.\n", "Q: How do I add more variants or custom packages to debootstrap? I have a set of packages that I wish to install along-side the minibase variant in debootstrap. I'm having the hardest time figuring out how to customize variants so that more than just the base is installed in a chroot when debootstrap is run. Any way to achieve this?\n\nA: It's pretty easy to add your own variant with additional custom packages to debootstrap. \nThe debootstrap configuration/runtime scripts are located in /usr/share/debootstrap/scripts.

Despite appearances to the contrary, it's unresponsive. It doesn't respond to keystrokes--including the Magic SysRq sequences, assuming I've converted them properly to my keyboard configuration. Sometimes it appears that the mouse will move, but I can't login via SSH. I'm left to reboot by cycling the power, as I can't find any other way out.\nI'm a teacher, and this machine usually lives in the staff room. Sometimes, though, I carry it to my classroom for use in class. The crashes tend to happen more frequently upon moving my computer to my classroom, though it's hard to say why. It doesn't necessarily have anything to do with physical movement, but I've only had one crash that did not take place in my classroom--the first.\nMy machine is a netbook--an HP Mini 110 running Precise. Perhaps also relevant is the fact that lots of programs seem to randomly crash on this machine for no apparent reason, particularly on login.\nAny ideas?\nEdit:\nAt the suggestion of Jorge Castro, I ran a MemTest86+ check on my RAM for about 2 hours and 15 minutes. It found no errors.\n\nA: *\n\n*I've most often seen that kind of \"video corruption\" crash when the system GPU is either overheating and/or being run out of bounds (read: overclocked/overvolted).\n\n*The Intel GMA950 graphics on your netbook have excellent driver support, so I'd suspect the heatsink/paste on the graphics chip inside the laptop may have gotten loose/dried up/etc.\n\n*I'd try running on an older Ubuntu LiveCD or Windows (if possible) for a few hours, and if the crashes keep happening, either open the netbook up and look around the GPU, or take it in to someone who can.\n\nA: After a period of time with no crashes, I got another crash today and made an interesting observation.\nToday, as with every other crash I can recall, I was holding my computer one-handed, in my left hand (I'm left-handed). Today's crash occurred precisely as I was changing the direction of movement, resulting in greater downward G-forces which applied increased pressure to the bottom of the case where my fingers were supporting the computer.\nWhen I looked underneath the computer to find the pressure point, I noticed that my fingers were on the RAM access cover. Considering Jorge Castro's suggestion of bad memory, combined with the fact that I have 2GB installed despite HP's claim that 1GB is the maximum, and the fact that there was physical pressure on the RAM cover, and likely on the RAM itself, I think I've found the culprit.\nI can't investigate any further until I take my machine to work on Monday, since all my tools are there, but this seems to me to be quite a reasonable explanation. As of now, I consider this question answered, though practical suggestions are certainly welcome. For now, I'll be handling my machine differently from now on to avoid pushing on the RAM.\nUpdate\nI've now tested this theory. I booted into Memtest to avoid crash problems and isolate the cause, and I found that by applying pressure to the RAM door I can reliably reproduce this crash.\nI haven't found a way to strengthen the door, or if replacing the RAM would do the trick. My current workaround is to handle my laptop with care.\n", "Q: Why are all the CCSM tick-boxes grayed out?

Can you suggest how I can investigate and hopefully fix this?\n\nA: I've got exactly the same issue here on the MBA 2010 late 11' thus it might be model-specific. It appeared after the last update as you described. \nafter playing around a bit ... here is what worked for me.\nI installed the nvidia-current drivers from the softwar center...\nAfter a reboot X was started with the nvidia drivers and the problem was gone. BUT ... the brightness controls were gone too...\nAdding the line\n\nOption \"RegistryDwords\" \"EnableBrightnessControl=1\"\n  in the Section \"Device\" of /etc/X11/xorg.conf\n  solved that issue.\n\nSee:\nBrightness not working after installing NVIDIA driver\nand\nhttp://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=1973581\nfor more information.\n", "Q: Why isn't shutdown giving me a chance to save files in running programs?

I think I may have accidentally erased the contents of lightdm.conf. Not entirely sure.\nI troubleshooted for the past hour using various suggestions from other Questions to no avail.\n\nA: There is an example version of lightdm.conf at:\n/usr/share/doc/lightdm/lightdm.conf.gz\n\nYou can see it with zcat /usr/share/doc/lightdm/lightdm.conf.gz.\n\nA: We can't do much debugging without your lightdm.conf file, but if you want a minimal version that will work, try this one:\n[SeatDefaults]\nuser-session=ubuntu\ngreeter-session=unity-greeter\nallow-guest=false\n\nEDIT: For future reference, you can make many changes to lightdm.conf easily and safely with the tool /usr/lib/lightdm/lightdm-set-defaults, including disabling the guest session.  \nTry it next time.

I just finished installing mysql-server, and then installed phpmyadmin which came with Apache and PHP. It set it up alright and made a phpMyAdmin database, but I can't seem to find the URL to get to it -- I tried going to http://my.server.ip/phpmyadmin but it doesn't seem to be there.\nI can't find the location in any of the manuals, does anyone know where this is located? Thanks.\n\nA: You just need to make a symbolic link to the installation in your server root. Mine is in /var/www/ (though check your DocumentRoot as default is often /var/www/html) so:\nsudo ln -s /usr/share/phpmyadmin/ /var/www/phpmyadmin\n\nAfter that, you'll be able to access trough localhost:\nhttp://localhost/phpmyadmin\n\nAs for why is not installed by default in its right location, or the installer creates a symbolic link itself, I have no idea...\n\nA: I imagine that you probably are facing the same issue that I had the first time I installed phpmyadmin.  Considering it's been over a year since you asked this, I'm assuming you've figured it out by now, but for future reference for others, if you can't see it when going to http://yourdomain.com/phpmyadmin, you probably need to reconfigure the package, and make sure that you place a checkbox in the apache2 box (assuming that's what you're using for your server) by pressing the spacebar before you continue.  I was going quickly and just pressed enter, not realizing that I hadn't selected apache2.  To reconfigure the package, use the following:\nsudo dpkg-reconfigure phpmyadmin\n\n\nA: Oh, usually the phpmyadmin goes to /usr/lib/phpmyadmin if I'm not wrong.\nI always need to move the folder to my www path.\n\nA: This answer is little bit more generic. To know the list of files installed by any package you have to do this \n\n\n*\n\n*Get the name of the package with dpkg --list | grep phpmyadmin\n\n*For list of file installed use this dpkg --listfiles <package_name step 1>\n\nA: For me it worked out differently.\nI've had to copy the apache.conf file from /etc/phpmyadmin to /etc/apache2/sites-available and to /etc/apache2/sites-enabled using file manager as root.\nThen I ran sudo service apache2 restart and everything was just fine.\nHope it's usefull.\n\nA: Presumably you have Apache installed and that's what you use as your main web server (ie, it listens on port 80).  If you have not done (much) customisation to your Apache install, it should be accessible at:\nhttp://localhost/phpmyadmin/\n\n(If you're accessing the server from a different machine, then obviously substitute localhost).\nThe installer for phpMyAdmin installs a config file into /etc/apache2/conf.d/ called phpmyadmin, which sets up an alias.  Look at this file to see how it works and where it should appear on your website.\nIf you have modified your Apache configuration, it's possible though unlikely that you have done something which overrides the directives in that phpmyadmin config file.  In which case you should be able to fix phpmyadmin's configuration yourself to get it working how you like it.\n\nA: http://127.0.0.1/phpmyadmin\nor also http://::1/phpmyadmin or http://localhost/phpmyadmin\nread: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Localhost\nalso, type \"ip addr\" to see your public address (or semi-public with NAT)\n\nA: Try using:\n<server_ip or localhost>/phpmyadmin/index.php\nThat might just do the trick. In the past this one solved it for me.\n\nA: In my case I had it under\n/usr/local/phpMyAdmin-*\n\nI guess you can always try to find it through (some) httpd configuration file. \n\nA: In my case this command worked: \nsudo ln -s /usr/share/phpmyadmin/ /var/www/html/phpmyadmin\n\nBecause my server root is default, that is: /var/www/html\n\nA: I re-configured and its working fine for me on Ubuntu 18.04 with the below command:\nsudo dpkg-reconfigure phpmyadmin\n\n", "Q: How to remove (purge) Opera PPA?

Ideally I'd open the software center, remove Opera and then it could ask me 'also remove the repository?' and then it'd be gone. \n\nA: PPA purge only works if you've installed a PPA (from ppa.launchpad.net). In order to remove it you need to manually remove the line from /etc/apt/sources.list\n\n\n*\n\n*How to remove a repository?\nIf a repository is leaving junk around you don't want, you can synaptic  and click the Origin button:\n\nThen click on the filter on the left that shows the repository, then you can select them and remove them from there.

If you're wondering what exactly the acpi_osi parameter does, see this askubuntu entry: What does the kernel boot parameter \"set acpi_osi=Linux\" do?\n\nA: For Samsung laptops that have a keyboard backlight (like the Chronos Series 7) which can be set when installing samsung-tools from the \"Linux on my Samsung\" PPA, it is actually recommendable to keep acpi_osi=linux in the Kernel command line.

I currently have an FM tuner hooked up to my desktop that I use to listen to the radio.  Since my country is in the process of switching to the DAB+ standard, I was wondering whether there are any similar devices available for the newer radio standard that are compatible with Ubuntu.\nA USB tuner would be good, but a PCIe or PCI card would be acceptable too.  It'd be nice if the tuner provided access to the data services transmitted along with the audio (e.g. the name of the current program/song), and access to the audio bitstream (i.e. it doesn't decode the audio internally and feed it to the line-in jack of the sound card).\n\nA: I recommend you try any of the DAB+/DVB tuners based on the Realtek RTL2839U  chipset (of which there are many); drivers for that chipset are actively developed in the community, by both people interested in the radio/TV aspect as well as people interested in the software-defined radio capabilities of the chip (it is capable of tuning to any signal between 64-1700 MHz with the appropriate antenna/software).\nUSB tuners are available which provide internal audio (as requested), and are capable of decoding metadata.\nHere are some resources:\n\n\n*\n\n*Driver for 3.2 kernels; others are also available\n\n*A popular USB DAB+ radio with the RTL2839U\n\n*Other models which are verified to work with the driver in (1) are:\n\nDIKOM USB-DVBT HD (ID 1b80:d394)\nNILOX DVB-T Stick N15 (ID 1b80:d393)\nTRUST 16738 (ID 0bda:2832)\nTERRATEC Cinergy T Stick BLACK (ID 0ccd:00a9)\nTX Hollywood DVTB (ID 1d19:1101)\nDIGIVOX mini II v3.0 (ID 1d19:1101)\n\n\n*For even more compatible models, see this Ubuntu Forums thread\n\n*Players that work with DAB+ include Kaffeine, as well as more general DVB players/applications. \n\n", "Q: Ubuntu 12.04 does not boot even with nomodeset I am running Ubuntu 12.04 on an AMD athlon II x2 240 w/ 3 GB ram and an ATI Radeon HD5670.

Now that Kernel 3.6 has been officially released, I'm wondering if the next Ubuntu point release will include the new Kernel?\n\nA: Not officially. LTS releases typically don't change kernel versions; see 10.04 Lucid -- it's still on the 2.6.x series.\nBut note these exceptions:\n\n*\n\n*Changes/patches that affect stability, security, etc. are typically backported from 3.5, etc. by the Ubuntu kernel team into the 3.2 series for 12.04.\n\n*Optional \"LTS backport\" kernels will be provided, based on the kernel series bundled in each future non-LTS release, which you may choose to install.

These kernel upgrades are also not offered as part of normal upgrades, so there's no need to worry that you'll be upgraded from one major kernel version to the other.

I'm really hoping on the next point release to fix these annoying problems, but I want to know... when is it expected to be released to the public?\n\nA: According to the official Ubuntu wiki it will be released August 23rd 2012.\nPrecise release schedule\n\nA: The 12.04.1 point release will be released August 23. https://wiki.ubuntu.com/QuantalQuetzal/ReleaseSchedule\nHowever, most fixes are made in new versions and those that are released to stable are generally rolled out gradually. If you have specific backport requests, or other unresolved issues, you should file a bug about it on Launchpad. see https://wiki.ubuntu.com/ReportingBugs\nIs this display manager issue you describe a flickering when logging in? And if so, are you using the radeon AMD/ATI driver? (lsmod | grep radeon)\n\nA: Ubuntu releases bug fix upgrades all the time to various packages, which you can get if you follow the -updates repository for your distribution.\nWhen there is a point release update to the CD/DVD images (which only happens for Ubuntu LTS), it simply incorporates all of the updates made thus far, which you would have installed already had you been installing updates on an existing installation.  So if you already install all available updates, you won't get anything new if you re-install from one of the point release updates.\nThat said, point release updates of Ubuntu LTS usually come out roughly every January and August at the moment.\n", "Q: Why isn't persistence working on Lubuntu 12.04 Live-USB? I have used Universal-USB-Installer ever since to install different Linux versions to USB flash drive. But now with Lubuntu 12.04 even though I do the same process by selecting persistence file, it gets created but is never used in Lubuntu. Every time I boot into Lubuntu on flash, it is fresh new Lubuntu without my changes I did last time I have booted it.\nAnyone can help me or give me some hints ? Thanks in advance.\n\nA: Please try creating the persistent USB with Unetbootin; we've seen many problems with the Universal Installer here.\nNote that I tried with Lubuntu 12.04 and persistence works perfectly for me:\n\n\n\n*\n\n*The persistent partiion /cow above is 256MB, and it works as expected.

Below was tested with Lubuntu/Ubuntu 14.04.1:\n\n\n*\n\n*The syslinux menu (or grub.cfg if GRUB2 is used) must have \"persistent\" (not \"persistence\") added as a kernel boot parameter as @Jason pointed it out:\n\n\n*\n\n*Example for syslinux:\nappend  file=/preseed/lubuntu.seed boot=casper persistent initrd=/casper/initrd.lz ...\n\n\n*Example for grub2:\nlinux /casper/vmlinuz file=/preseed/ubuntu.seed boot=casper persistent quiet splash ...\n\n\n\n*And the Flash-device's partition that is reserved for persistent data must be labelled \"casper-rw\"\nThis is achived with a nice GUI tool such as gparted, or in command-line, eg:\nmkfs.ext2 -L casper-rw -m 0 /dev/sd<FLASH-DEVICE-PARTITION-FOR-PERSISTENT-DATA>\n\n", "Q: Installation problem with Atom D2500 Cedarview I just got my netbook yesterday and spent the whole day to get Ubuntu into it.\n\n\n*\n\n*Intel Atom D2500, Cedarview, 1.86 GHz, 2 GB RAM.\n\n\nAn error occurred when I tried to install both using WUBI and ISO.

By default LightDM allows the user to select their name from a scrolling list. (this is not a showstopper though)\n\n*All users must to access a single desktop environment and the same home directory for document collaboration (single document repository for all users). I also want to avoid configuring the desktop UI look and feel as many times as the number of users.**  I have planned a branded desktop background, launcher layout and other things consistent with a Training manual I am putting together.\n\n*I need to audit log in logout date/time stamps for each user to capture time spent.  The answer to this question helps me with this point.  (I will need to understand if the answer is still valid as it was written in 2010.)\n\n\nI am asking a very specify question; Is what I have described above holistaically achievable and if so how?  I will accept a \"No\" or \"Probably not\" answer. If that is the case please help me understand with a brief \"why\" and I will go back to the drawing board.  The reason for asking the question is that I suspect its not achievable but want to be 100% sure.\n\nA: Dont know if this is what you are looking for but if you had a separate ext4 partition that was auto-mounted for every user you could use this as a global home folder ?\n\nA: I'm sure I'm missing a crucial bit, but if you want to avoid configuring the desktop many times as the number of users, can't you just do it once and copy the appropriate files to each user's home directory?\n\nA: hmm...\nYou may be able to get away with using symlinks.  If you created the users and then removed their home folder and then replaced it with a symlink, pointing to the \"shared\" home folder, theoretically any changes that were made would happen to the shared home folder.\nex:\nln -s /home/shared_home /home/new_users_home\nYou would really be hacking it together at that point.\nI'm not sure that doing it that way will work at all, or if it works up front, continue to work in the long term.  There are so many items stored in a users home, including browser cache, etc.... You can look forward to some strange happenings I'm sure.\nIf you want a central repository for documents.  You might just create that directory and then place a link on the desktop for each user... This won't make each users desktop environment identical, but would take care of the document repository issue.\nYou could create the base account (and configure it exactly how you wanted it, link to document repository on desktop and all).  Then create the next user, remove their home dir, and copy the base accounts home dir to the new user.  Effectively replacing the new users home dir with your specific config.  Rinse and repeat.\nHope this helps\n\nA: Edit the home folder for each user in /etc/passwd and point it all to the same home directory. This will mean that they share all settings as well as documents.\nIf you only wanted to share documents saved in the Documents folder, but allow each user to configure any settings separately you could replace each Documents folder with a link to a shared one.\n", "Q: Thunderbird date format?

The mount tab directories are supported by libmount only. It's not planned to support fstab.d in mount(8) by default. \nThe problem is that /etc/fstab is de facto standard used on many places (libc, systemd, UI programs, ..) and it's unreal wish that all the places can be changed to support fstab.d.\nAnyway, you can use a new mount(8) from util-linux >= 2.21 and a new option --fstab <path> to specify alternative mount table, this option also supports directories. It means you have to explicitly specify the directory -- mount(8) will not read it by default.

I want to edit some files via nano or gedit.But When I enter nano filename.php bash returns ?Invalid Command.\nHow can i edit files via using ubuntu terminal? \n\nA: There are multiple options for Ubuntu on how to do this. If you want to do this using a GUI you could simply open Nautilus and connect a server of the type of FTP.\nIf you want to do it through a shell you could mount it using ftpfs, which is one of my favorite ways since I get the controls as if it were local files.\nTo do so:\n$ sudo apt-get install curlftpfs\nAfter the install of curlftpfs type:\n$ mkdir -p ~/mnt/ftpfs\n$ curlftpfs <username>@<server> ~/mnt/ftpfs\n$ cd ~/mnt/ftpfs/\n$ ls\nYou should now be able to list your files.\nKind regards,\nJochen\n\nA: The \"!\" command in BSD FTP is meant to give you a shell on your local machine.\nYou cannot use it to run commands on the remote machine - that would make absolutely no sense security wise, for starters.\nHowever, you can search for an editor that can pull and push the files you wish to edit from the FTP server in a transparent fashion if you are bothered by the constant get-ting and put-ting.\nI seem to recall BBEdit for Mac OS 9 did it back then, for example.\nEmacs Can Probably Do It (tm).\n", "Q: Ubuntu 12.04 Slow Graphics I've been having slowdowns in Ubuntu since upgrading to 12.04, sometimes even freezing and crashing my PC.

I've bought a 1TB external hard drive and after formatting the entire drive in ext4\nNautilus says there are 934.3 GB of free space. \nI've also tested formatting the drive in XFS, and in this case there are 999.7 GB of free space.\nWhy more than 60 GB are missing from free space with ext4 and not with XFS ?\n\nA: With ext4 (and the extfs family) the inode tables are pre-allocated at format time. This is the traditional Unix behavior concerning file systems. When you format a volume with the extfs file system, you can tweak the number of inode you expect using the -N parameter of the mkfs utility. (Source). \nThis design may offer better performance (when allocating many files at a time) in spite of scalability. One has to estimate the number of inode needed at format time. A volume containing mostly small files, say a mail server, will require more inodes per gigabyte than a volume containing ISOs. \nOnce you used all the inodes you just can’t create new file even if there is still free space on the drive. The bigger the volume is, the larger the inode tables will be. That leads to many gigabytes lost on large drives.\nOn the other hand, XFS uses a technique called \"dynamic inode allocation\" (Source). This leads to better scalability as the number of inodes grows or shrinks depending on the amount of data on the volume. This is a better design when you can’t predict what the file system will be used for or when you expect to save the extra space for your data. This is also the NTFS behavior.\nWhat has been said about journaling is wrong, journaling costs only a few megabytes. The main space loss is due to static inode allocation.\n\nA: \nEXT3/EXT4 filesystems take 5% of partition size for security etc. (e.g. in \"non free disk space disk\" cause).\n\nIf it isn't root partition, You could change this 5% to e.g. 1% by doing: \nsudo tune2fs -m 1 /dev/sda3\n\nwhere you should change sda3 to your partition.\n", "Q: $PATH from /etc/environment overwritten I'm upgrading a bunch of installations of 10.04 to 12.04.

If I log in via tty the PATH has the value I indicated in /etc/environment but if I log into X the PATH has the value /usr/local/bin:/usr/bin:/bin:/usr/games\nAny help will be appreciated.\n\nA: Please check /etc/X11/xinit/xinitrc, /etc/X11/Xsession and the files in /etc/skel.\nI assume that you have ruled out any user specific configuration files by creating a brand new user and logging in as that user.\n", "Q: groups: cannot find name for group ID 125 I've recently uninstalled virtualbox and since then, everytime I open a terminal I get the following:\n\ngroups: cannot find name for group ID 125\n\nThe output of /etc/group is here:\n\nhttp://pastebin.com/gysgpHra\n\nI didn't want to paste the full output here, it's a bit long.\nStrangely enough, there is no group 125 but as far as I remember that was assigned to the vboxusers group.\nGoogle has not been helpful at all.\nI see a similar question here:\n\nhttps://askubuntu.com/questions/131651/cannot-find-name-for-group-id-127\n\nBut I don't know what he's talking about here:\n\nBut I've found it in the group- list\nEntry\n  vboxusers:x:127:peter\n\nCan anyone point me the right direction?\n\nA: You could use sudo delgroup vboxusers to completely remove that group, if the uninstallation of Virtualbox failed to do that. Then enter id in the terminal and your uid, gid, and the groups you belong to will be listed, and vboxusers shouldn't be there.\nIf this does not work you could simply reinstall Virtualbox with sudo apt-get install --reinstall <virtualbox pkg names> and then you might be able to remove the package cleanly with sudo apt-get purge <virtualbox version> (which would remove any configuration files) and then you could use sudo apt-get autoremove to remove any other files left by Virtualbox. Then you could try my first suggestion again.\nLastly, if these options are unsuccessful, but installing Virtualbox does show that group 125 is virtualbox, you could remove the Virtualbox users group (as detailed in my first suggestion with sudo delgroup vboxusers), before you uninstall Virtualbox. This may work as Virtualbox doesn't seem to be uninstalling correctly and seems to be leaving a partial group that can't easily be removed after uninstallation as it doesn't show up in /etc/group.\nIt also should be said that you need to logout and login again for any changes to users and groups to take effect.\n\nA: I had the same problem, and the reason was that I added user to a group docker manually with \nsudo usermod -a -G docker hassan\n\nand later when I uninstalled docker.io, I removed the group with \nsudo groupdel docker\n\nso after that, I used to get the following:\n$ groups\nhassan adm cdrom sudo dip plugdev lpadmin sambashare libvirtd\ngroups: cannot find name for group ID 999\n\nSo to fix this I simply logged out and logged back in and that was it. You can test simply by doing AltCtrlF2 and login in. Then give the groups command and you will not see the same error message again.\n\nA: I had the same issue. The problem was actually prety simple. In my case, someone had changed the priviledges of /etc/group, and had removed all rwx from me. So the system saw I did not have the priviledge to access the name of the group I nbelonged, so it printed this message.\nMaybe something similar migh be happening in your case.\n\nA: I had the same problem after uninstalling Chrome Remote Desktop for Linux, except in my case it was gid 1003:\ngroups: cannot find name for group ID 1003\npaul@Chameleon:~$ groups\npaul adm cdrom sudo audio dip video plugdev lpadmin pulse sambashare vboxusers groups: cannot find name for group ID 1003\n1003\npaul@Chameleon:~$\n\nWhat resolved the issue for me was rewriting the user account's groups using the usermod command:\nsudo usermod -G paul,adm,cdrom,sudo,audio,dip,video,plugdev,lpadmin,sambashare,vboxusers,pulse  paul\n\nAfter issuing that command, I verified it resolved the issue by switching to VT1 (Ctrl+Alt+F1), logged in, and observed the error was no longer displayed.\n\nA: Check /etc/nscd.conf make sure that the following line is there:\n enable-cache            group           yes\n\n", "Q: Error when atempting to install Ubuntu 12.04 Attemping a new install of Ubuntu 12.04 on what was a Windows XP laptop (HP Pavilon ze4500 with 40GB HDD).

I want to generate a package download list, which can be used to download those packages from another system. (I have a slow connection). I want to use those downloaded files to create a local repository from which I can install/upgrade my system.\nHow can I achieve this?\n\nA: First Note that, You must have the updated package indexes (these indexes are used by package management softwares to get information about the available packages online). So, you must download at least those index files. \nTo do so, open a terminal and give this command. (You must have a working internet connection for this step)\nsudo apt-get update \n\nAfter you have the update package index files, use any of the method below:\nTerminal way without synaptic\nUse this command to generate an list of files needed to upgrade your system \nsudo apt-get upgrade --allow-unauthenticated -y --print-uris | grep -o '\\'http.*\\' | tr \"\\'\" \" \" > download-list \n\nThe file download-list will be created in the current folder of the terminal.\nOr, If you want to generate a download script for a specific package, use this command (see the update section below for another command)\nsudo apt-get install <package-name> --allow-unauthenticated -y --print-uris | grep -o '\\'http.*\\' | tr \"\\'\" \" \" > download-list\n\nreplace, <package-name> with actual name of the package. such as gtg for getting-things-gnome etc.\nYou can now use this file to feed any download manager which support input files with URLs. \nFor example to use this file with wget use this command below,\nwget -c -i ./download-list\n\nassuming download-list file is in the current directory of the terminal. The downloaded files will be stored in the current working directory of the terminal. \nUpdate: I've found another command to generate package download list: \napt-get --allow-unauthenticated -y install --print-uris package-name | cut -d\\' -f2 | grep http:// > download-list\n\nCredit of the updated command: answerer of this post\n\nGraphical way using Synaptic\nSynaptic package manager has built-in feature to generate package download script and you don't even need to to use wget explicitly in terminal, Only executing the script is sufficient.\nThe procedure is as follows\n\n\n*\n\n*Install Synaptic Package Manager using terminal:\n sudo apt-get update \n sudo apt-get install synaptic\n\n(First command is not required, if you have updated package index  files, If you are not sure, use both).\n\n*Then open Synaptic Package Manager by Typing Synaptic in the dash.\n\n*Select a package in the right section of the window, Right Click → Mark it for installation. Alternatively, If you want to generate an upgrade script, push the button Mark All Upgrades in the toolbar. The image below uses the second method.\n\n\n*When asked if you want to Mark additional required chanages, press the Mark button.  \n\n\n*Then going to File --> Generate package download script, save the script as a file by give it a name and select a directory where to save it. Now, You have a script for package downloads.\nIf you want to download, Go to the scripts directory and run sh ./<script-name>. For example, if the name of the script is download-list and it is in your Downloads folder, the command is\ncd ~/Downloads && sh ./download-list\n\n\nA: Synaptic also has a menu item to export selected packages to a file.\n", "Q: Why does my computer shuts down itself every morning at 6 AM? My computer shuts down by itself at a specific time everyday 6:00am. I can't find what's causing it.\nI'm a long time Windows user and just recently tried Ubuntu.

It's working OK and I'm pretty sure my auto shutdown problem is not cause by qshutdown since I checked all of its settings.\nNow, maybe when I was still new to Ubuntu, I maybe installed some package about auto shutdown. I really can't remember if I did or didn't.

Using the cursor keys, move the cursor to that line and remove it. Assuming vi will be used as editor, enter dd (which removes that line), followed by :x to save it back and exit the editor.\nNow the event is removed, and no longer will be executed -- problem solved.\n", "Q: Why are colors messed up on video playback (Nvidia bug)?

I like to use the Ubuntu Software Center, but I cannot adjust the font size of the entries.

Now you may use this to change the font size affecting the software center, however unfortunately all other applications as well. A recommended way to preform the font change would be to open the settings, change the font size, and then when done with the software center, return it to it's original form, or however you prefer it. If you can't get the application from the software center, due to the small size of the font just paste the following into your terminal - \nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get install gnome-tweak-tool\n\n\nHere is what Advanced Settings should appear as, simply click the font size next to the default font to make changes.\n\nWell, you don't really want to mess with the other settings I'm assuming, (Graphics Drivers, or Screen Resolution) But, just to voice other solutions, you could start by seeing if this is the graphics driver, I personally use the open source one because I have no other choice than binary blobs, or the screen resolution could be toned down to make the text appear larger...

For that, I recommend you refer to Flabricorn's excellent answer just above or below this one...\n\nA: Most 32-bit operating systems should work fine under a 64-bit computer, I'm currently running a 64-bit computer with Ubuntu in 32-bit. No problems should yet be encountered. \nNOW, for Oracle 11g R2, there are some extras that should be installed because they aren't provided by default. But we'll get to those in a second, and a lot of them aren't fully necessary but they'll make it easier.

The only thing that I miss in GNOME Fallback is the search function in the panel.\nIn GNOME, when you press the Super key (Windows key), you can immediately start typing the name of the application and then click on the desired application from the results shown to launch that app. I find that in \"classic\" GNOME, it is fully menu driven; there is no option to search for installed applications using the panel or from within the Applications menu.\nI was wondering if this feature could be added to GNOME Fallback, so that instead of going by the menu, I can for example press the Super key and then type the name of the application and then launch it from the results shown.\nI have only very limited exposure, am still figuring things out.

I have the DVD version of 12.04, which I tried to install on my Lenovo machine with a Core i3 processor.\nIt's working on live mode but when I tried to install to my hard drive it after telling it what partitions to use it fails with a \"can't copy file\" error. The error also had some number associated with it--I believe it was \"error 3\" or \"error 5\" but I don't remember.\nI also tried making a bootable pendrive but it shows same error. After this I tried the CD version of 11.10 is install and its successfully done.\nWhy can't I install from the DVD version?\n\nA: Are you sure this is actually happening while partitioning, rather than after partitioning? If the error message really says \"cannot copy file,\" that's most likely to occur while installing (specifically, while copying files from the DVD to already-created partitions on the hard disk).\nYou haven't given us much information, but most problems copying files while installing are the result of bad installation media. So:\n\n\n*\n\n*MD5 test the .iso image you used to create the DVD.\n\n*Check the DVD for defects in the machine on which you're attempting to install.\nSince you created both DVD media and USB media from the DVD .iso image and got what you believe to be the same error, it's most likely the .iso image itself is what's bad (so the MD5 test will reveal the problem and you can re-download the DVD .iso).\n\n\n*\n\n*If you download a new .iso image, MD5 test it, and find it's corrupted as well, you might try downloading via torrent, since the BitTorrent protocol checks for (and fixes) corruption as it's downloading. You mentioned that you had a similar problem installing at least one other OS (Backtrack). Most other operating systems also have MD5 hashes (or similar) available, and you can check to see if those downloads are corrupted in the same way.\n\n\nHowever, if the MD5 test doesn't reveal errors, you should still check the installation media for defects. You may have two separate, defective writes, or a subtle hardware problem in the machine on which you're installing.\nIf this happens with other .iso images, even if it includes .iso images for other OSes, it's still worth running those tests, as there may be a systematic problem (for example, with your Internet connection) causing you to download corrupted .iso files. There may also be a systematic problem (perhaps with your technique) causing them to be written and/or burned incorrectly.\nDepending on the nature of a hardware problem, doing \"Check disc for defects\" (which applies to USB media as well as actual CD/DVD discs) may fail due to a hardware problem on the computer on which you perform it. That can be good, in that in combination with other information, it can make it possible to diagnose a hardware problem.\nIt also might be that, due to a problem downloading images, burning/writing them, or a problem with the computer on which you're installing, all installations have a high chance of failure, and that your one installation succeeded more due to luck than due to it being a different ISO image and installation medium.\n", "Q: \"The disk drive for / is not ready yet or not present\" message on boot After upgrading my Ubuntu machine from ver. 11.10 to 12.04, I get the following error and the machine stop working before any graphical environment:\n** (plymouthd:357): WARNING **: Command line `dbus-launch --autolaunch=530c973a1fe4d1e1e6bd... \n--binary-syntax --close-stderr' exited with non-zero exit status 1: Autolaunch error:\nX11 initialization failed.\\n\nudevd[397]: specified group 'colord' unknown\nThe disk drive for / is not ready yet or not present.\nContinue to wait, or Press S to skip mounting or M for manual recovery.\n\nAny help appreciated.\n\nA: I think I had the same problem going from 10.04 to 12.04.1.

I could login with this id, However I added another user \"sashank\", though if I try to login with \"sashank\" am not able to go beyond login screen.\nHow can I login as sashank and have access to /home/sashank as before the upgrade?\nAny help would be greatly appreciated.\n\nA: Based on your comment, i think the problem is with the ownership of \"sashank\" home folder. In the ouput of ls -la /home \"sashank\" folder belongs to user \"sherry\".\nThe problem is that, when you create the first user of the system, usually it stays with the user id (uid) 1000 and creates a folder in \"/home\", corresponding to the home folder of the newly created user. So before you upgraded your system, sashank had uid 1000. After you upgraded, probably \"sherry\" became uid 1000. So when you created user \"sashank\" it got another uid (1001, for example), and when you try to login with him it has no permission to write on his home folder (it was already there, and now belongs to \"sherry\").\nTo fix this use this command: sudo chown -R sashank:sashank /home/sashank. It will change recursively the ownership of the home folder of \"sashank\" account. Then logout and try to login as sashank.\nThis is just a guess, hope it helps.\n", "Q: A GtkEntry signal emitting at focus change I'm writing a very simple app using Glade and PyGtk.

Look in the manual for more information: man sources.list.\n\n*Run sudo modprobe -r tg3 to unload the driver and then sudo modprobe tg3 to load the driver to see if the propper firmware get loaded.  Look at the log you started to look at earlier with the tail-command to see what happens. It should show up there that the devices is installed and that the firmware is installed.\n\n*If it works, set up the network in /etc/network/interfaces and execute sudo ifup eth1 or what your device name are.\n\n\nIn short, you don't have the firmware that is needed to operate your network card.

Any help?\n\nA: You've downloaded an ISO image of a CD-ROM. In order to install it, you will have to prepare a bootable medium of some sort (either burning the image to a CD with Brasero or creating a bootable USB stick with Startup Disk Creator), boot it, and install the software.\nThe community wiki installation page is here\nAnother topic I can think you might want to visit is ...\nHow can I keep recent files from appearing in Unity?\n\nA: Based on your question, you downloaded a reinstaller. If this was Wubi, the problem would be using am .exe file, and Ubuntu cannot open those without Wine patches. Now a recommended course of action would to burn a live CD or USB based on whether or not you have a disk drive. If you have a disk drive you should burn a live CD. You should have access to a disk burning application already and if you don't, they're available in the Ubuntu Software Center. After you burn the disk you need to reboot the computer. During the boot up, hold the key that allows you to access the BIOS settings. If you are using a Mac, if I can remember correctly, you hold down the \"c\" key, and if not, try \"Cmd+C\". BIOS keystrokes vary from computer to computer, however \"f2\" and \"f12\" I've found common enough. Simply find your boot device section within the BIOS and switch from the main Hard Drive to the CD drive. Now save changes and exit. You should now come to a Live Installation of Ubuntu 12.04 LTS. Simply click install and there should be an option to erase the current drive and install Ubuntu over it. With a Mac, by holding \"C\" or \"cmd + c\" you should boot directly to yaboot (Similar to the GRUB boot manager), simply press enter, and you will enter the live install. Again there is the option to erase everything. The reinstall should wipe the disk.  \nHope this was of help!\n", "Q: Can someone spell out what this wget command to install Heroku toolbelt does?

What does that do?\nThank you very much for the time!\n\nA: That command actually is wget -qO not wget -q0.\nIt will download the file https://toolbelt.heroku.com/install.sh silently (-q option) and anything downloaded will be will be concatenated together and written to a single file buffer file (-O option), that downloaded buffer will then be pipped to and executed with sh.\nsh is a shell interpreter that will run the information that wget just downloaded.\nSo, in simple words you are telling with this command: download this sh file and don't create a progress output and whatever you download execute it with sh.\n\nA: *\n\n*Like most isolated programs started from a terminal, wget normally will NOT continue running after its parent (terminal) has been closed (via logout, etc. )\n\n*-qO- is an abbreviation of the two command line options -q -O-\n\n\n*\n\n*q tells wget not to output status/progress info\n\n*O- tells it to output the downloaded data to standard output\n\n\n*| sh pipes the data from standard output to the sh command, executing the script\n\nA: That is not a 0 (number) it's an O (letter), it redirects the output to a file, in this case (-) the standard output, so the downloaded file's content will be redirected (by the |) to the sh standard input. sh is a shell, a command interpreter that will execute the commands it receives.\nYou can learn more searching for Redirections in sh manpage (man sh).\n", "Q: Hard Drive Load Cycle Count Does the load cycle count shown below, using SMART, show the total count of the hard drives lifetime?

No changes are needed. If you want to add unsupported PPAs for \"bleeding edge\" KDE packages, those are additional and at your own risk. \n\nA: Yes, as izx said, you shouldn't remove any repositories and Kubuntu has the same core packages available as Ubuntu, but different ones installed.\nHowever, one of the first things I do in a new install of Kubuntu is adding ppa:kubuntu-ppa/ppa, because the official repositories don't push new KDE versions... I recommend it to you as well; I never had problems with it, because new KDE versions get properly tested there too.\nppa:kubuntu-ppa/backports may also be worth adding when a new version of Ubuntu is released and you use an older one and don't want to upgrade.

My second drive contains all of the data that I would like to be able to share with specific users.\nI want to prevent users (except for myself) from being able to ssh into the server, and I would like all users to be able to use sftp to transfer data to and from my \"data\" drive.\nLimiting ssh access was easy. I created the group \"ssh_users\", added my account to it, and added AllowGroups ssh_users to the sshd_config file.\nGetting the sftp to work as I want it to has been a struggle. I thought chrooting users to the data drive would work, but maybe I don't have permissions setup correctly?\nWhat can I do to get this working? Thanks\n\nA: I wrote an article about that some time ago: http://en.positon.org/post/SFTP-chroot-rsync\nI think what you need in /etc/ssh/sshd_config is:\n# we use openssh internal sftp\n# because /usr/lib/openssh/sftp-server won't be available in chroot\nSubsystem sftp internal-sftp\n\nMatch group sftp\n        ChrootDirectory %h\n        X11Forwarding no\n        AllowTcpForwarding no\n        ForceCommand internal-sftp\n\nYou can change the ChrootDirectory to your need, however, the chroot directory have to be owned by root and not writeable by the users. This is a security restriction from the OpenSSH developers.\nAlso, carefully check /var/log/auth.log for SSH connections problems.\n\nA: When you have local users who can use ftps you can mount the data drive into there home directories and then chroot their home directory.\nmount  --bind /data/drive /home/user/data\nchroot_local_user=YES\nWith this setup the users have access to the data drive but, but can't list the filesystem om the primairy drive.\nIf you want you can limit permissions of the ftp users by adding them to a new group and give this group certain permissions on the data drive.\n\nA: Check this article and combine it with the group permissions on the folder(s) you want to share. It will do the trick.\n", "Q: sudo: file permissions If I create or modify any file or directory with sudo then permissions go to root only. And it seems that I need to use sudo in order to do some things in ubuntu. For example, I can't seem to mount a server without using the super user.\n\nA: Using sudo means you are running as the root user for that command.  Any files or directories you create will be owned by root.  If you want to give your normal user access, you need to change the permissions and/or ownership\nsomething like chown <yourusername>:<yourgroupname> <filename>\nwhen mounting the smb server, try setting the ownership/permissions on the mountpoint first, before mounting the drive.\n\nA: General Unix Permissions Information\nThis is the fundamental way any POSIX (Unix/Linux/others) work. Everything is done under a user. Whenever you make a directory it inherits the owner and default permissions set in the umask of that owner. Whenever you do something with sudo, you basically do the operation not with your user but with the user \"root\" - the \"Administrator\" in Windows.\nsudo is just a shortcut for:\n\n*\n\n*Login as \"root\".\n\n*Run the command.\n\nIn Windows terms - \"Run as Administrator\".\nHaving that in mind, it should be clear that you should not need to use sudo for anything related to your user. It should be only needed for use with stuff owned by the \"root\" user. Stuff such as the system configuration in /etc/, mounting drive volumes etc.\nNow, there are things that are typically done by \"root\" but sometimes need to be done by a user. To allow this, there are groups who are given permissions to that. For example the group \"disk\" is allowed to access hard drives in raw mode - i.e. like \"root\". If you want to be able to that with your own user - you simple have to add yourself to that group like so:\nsudo adduser [yourself] disk\n\nObviously only root can do that so you need sudo.\nThis is generally how permissions work in POSIX OSes. There is more to it but this should answer your particular issue. How to solve the particular SAMBA problem is a separate topic.\nYou can find more on Unix permissions in this lecture on Unix including Unix permissions from University of Toronto.\nMounting SAMBA shares as non-root\nNow about your particular issue with SAMBA - there is nicely described way to do it in the Samba Client Guide. Note that above that on the same page there are also other ways to do it via UI.\n", "Q: Just built a computer; trying to install Ubuntu from a flash drive I've just finished assembling my PC and I'm trying to install Ubuntu on it (there is no operating system on this machine).

The installer can sometimes still thinks it is really on a CD drive, and gets confused.\nI would suggest simply burning the .ISO image to a CD, and trying this instead.\n(OR, get a friend to create a genuine (Ubuntu-native) 'USB installer' on their copy of Ubuntu.)\n\nA: Odd behaviour such as things failing that should never fail or things that fail once and don't fail the next time you try them are often a sign of bad memory (RAM). The mechanism at work producing such behaviour is that a RAM module stores value \"A\" in a memory cell but then returns \"B\" when asked for the value. This can produce data corruption, literally anywhere on the system, since different things use the bad cells at different times. Obviously there are other things that could cause that such as bad installation media or bad media you install to, but that happens much more rarely in my experience.\nIn your case APT failed when it shouldn't have. Once booting led you to a blinking cursor, next time it lead you to a GRUB error. These happenings should be enough to warrant a memory test. On top of that, memory modules that are faster than standard also known as overclocked or \"OC\", often have higher rate of defects. That's due to rough grained binning process used to minimize cost. This means that only a few modules per batch (1000 units for example) are tested to sustain the lowered latencies at the high frequencies they are set to operate on. Your modules are such and that should double warrant a memory test.\nMemory test is performed by using the Memtest86+ utility, which is available on the default Ubuntu Live USB/CD. The option is in the boot menu and it's called \"Memory test\". Once you boot from the key and select \"Memory test\" you will be greeted with blue screen with lots of numbers and bars. The important one is \"Pass\". You have to let the test run until one full pass is completed. If the pass is completed without anything red appearing in the bottom half of the screen then you are good. The red lines indicate errors. If there are errors, the \"Errors\" counter will obviously be flipped as well.\nBad RAM is actually the easy way out of this, because the solution is as easy as swapping the modules. Most retailers or manufacturers will swap bad RAM without asking questions. They know. However if your RAM is good, then diagnosing the problem can become much harder.\n", "Q: Ubuntu 12.04 stuck on log-in screen after updating OpenTTD I had updated OpenTTD to the latest version however the update crashed in Software Center half-way through.\nI restarted my laptop but when I get to the log-in screen and after entering my password, a black screen is displayed with some text, which appears too quickly to read and then it takes me back to the log-in screen.\nThis is repeated over and over and I cannot log in.

I have Windows 8 Release Customer Preview on my laptop. I tried to install Ubuntu on it with Ubuntu Windows installer (I have always used this to install, although that was on Windows 7), it installs and asks to reboot, then immediately Windows 8 boots up.\nI do not have the option to choose what OS to boot. How can I boot to Ubuntu? VM is not exactly what I would like to use, but it is an option, however a last resort. Any help?\n\nA: Windows 8 uses a graphical bootloader different to that used in Windows 7 or Vista.\nThe answer here points out that the wubi maintainers have disabled it on the 12.04 CDs for various reasons, one of which is:\n\n\n*\n\n*...\n\n*...\n\n*...\n\n*Most significantly, Windows is changing it's boot system with Windows 8, and it's not clear how wubi will work with Windows 8, if at all.\n\n\nSo basically, Windows 8 is too new for the Windows Installer to deal with.\nYou will probably need to edit the Windows 8 bootloader menu. EasyBCD claims to work for Windows 8 but I haven't tried it.\nWubi also loses a lot of functionality you could get with a regular install if you partitioned correctly. \n\nA: Wubi doesn't work on UEFI systems that use GPT disks. Every new computer with Windows 8 has a UEFI boot, because that's the only thing that supports secure boot.\nTherefore Wubi won't work on any new computer with Windows 8. \nIt works fine with Windows 8 if you boot with BIOS, so if you upgraded to Windows 8, you likely have a BIOS board and it will work.\nThere's no practical workaround at this time, other than waiting for a fix from Canonical's Ubuntu installer team. The amount of effort required to switch to a legacy BIOS boot and replacing the GPT disk with a MBR partition table setup would negate the whole point of Wubi: to easily install and remove Ubuntu from Windows (for trial purposes).\nHere's the bug report: https://bugs.launchpad.net/bugs/694242\n\nA: This is an issue that I believe to have solved- it is like this problem here -\nDual Boot Windows 8 with Ubuntu 12.10\nMy suggestion (and it's only a suggestion) is to tpe \"msconfig\" (without the quotes) on the Windows 8 start screen. In the boot tab, see if Ubuntu is listed. If it is, select the entry by highlighting it and click on \"Set as default\". This should hopefully load the Ubuntu bootloader instead of Windows' boot menu allowing you you boot into Ubuntu.\nAlso, from the start screen type in \"uefi\" and in the settings option on the seach charm, click on \"Advanced start up options\", click on it. Scroll down to the bottom of the entry and under \"Advanced start up\", click Restart now. You should now have an option to change the boot order.\nI know it is the same solution to another one but to me the core problem is the same- Windows 8 bootloader\n", "Q: compiz --replace not finishing I read online, to check if your compiz is running correctly, you should type compiz --replace.

Is there a default password that may be in use?\n\nA: That the user can log in without providing a password, does not mean that the user does not have a password. It only means that the system does not require it, to let them in.\nThe answer to your last question is: No, there is no default password.\nIf you have another user on the same system, who knows their password and has sudo permissions, then they can change the password for the user who forgot theirs.

After that I directly jump to Advanced Customization (section 6.7) located at https://help.ubuntu.com/community/LiveCDCustomization#Advanced_Customizations . My questions are:-\n1) When I run the following command to mount the live cd, it shows a warning that the iso is mounted as read only. Is it ok, or should it be writable? \n2) There are three folders created in the folder livecdtmp. They are edit, extract-cd and mnt. My questions are, which folder should I edit so that the change happens to the \"customized live cd\", and which folder to edit to have the customized Ubuntu installation ? \n3) What is the use of extract-cd, edit and mnt folders ?\n4) The tutorial says, to have a custom background for GNOME, I have to edit /usr/share/gnome-background-properties/ubuntu-wallpapers.xml . Which file, or the file in which folder should I edit for the change to happen both in Live cd and the customized installation.\n5) Then, coming to the Advanced Customiation --> Kernel Updation, once inside the chroot, I cannot issue the following commands :-\nsudo cp edit/boot/vmlinuz-2.6.15-26-k7 extract-cd/casper/vmlinuz\nsudo cp edit/boot/initrd.img-2.6.15-26-k7 extract-cd/casper/initrd.lz\n\nIt says, folder dosn't exist. Should this be done from inside the chroot environment ?\n6) The tutorial says that, in order to edit the inird.lz file, I have to perform the following steps.\n# cd extract-cd/casper\n# mkdir lztempdir\n# cd lztempdir\n# lzma -dc -S .lz ../initrd.lz | cpio -imvd --no-absolute-filenames\n\nShould this be done in chroot environment that we initially prepared ? Does editing this file alone make changes to both the customized live cd as well as to the installation made from that live cd ?\nWhen I run the last command, I get the error, that there is a premature end of archive, or no file found ?\nFrom the # symbol, it means that I should run it within the chroot environment. But the problem is that, whenever I run the command cd extract-cd/casper , it says, there is no such directory which is actually true, because, what is mounted is the 'edit' folder. So, what should be done ?\n7) There are initrd.lz file in /casper folder in both 'extracr-cd' and 'mnt'. Should I copy the Kernel file to both these folders? Which one should I need to edit inorder to have updated kernel, new plymouth theme, etc ?\n8) I wish to set gnome-classic to have in the live cd? What should be done in order to have the gnome-classic in both the live cd and in the installation made with that cd ?\n9) How to remove lightdm login screen and to have the gdm like login screen that was initially present in Ubuntu  till around 9.10 ?\nUpdate:- When I ran the following command outside chroot, I get the following error.\nroshan@roshan-Studio-1558:~/initrd$ lzma -dc -S .lz ../livecdtmp/extract-cd/casper/initrd.lz | cpio -imvd --no-absolute-filenames\n\nlzma: ../livecdtmp/extract-cd/casper/initrd.lz: File format not recognized\ncpio: premature end of archive\n\n\nA: Edit is the one you want to chroot into, mnt is where you mount the read-only ISO, extract-cd is the extracted ISO.\nThe ISO is fine as read-only, as I understand it, it is mounted at mnt. You DO NOT want to edit mnt, just the extracted CD. When you are done, you will make your own ISO. Anything you edit in the LiveCD, as I understand it, will be reflected in the installed system. Anything which has folders such as extract-cd, edit or mnt is not done inside chroot. As for the kernel - you need your own kernel here, and then you can\nsudo cp /path/to/vmlinuz extract-cd/casper/vmlinuz\nsudo cp /path/to/initrd extract-cd/casper/initrd.lz\n\nWhen done with the kernel:\nsudo chroot edit\nmkinitramfs -o /initrd.lz [kernel version]\nexit\nmv edit/initrd.gz extract-cd/casper/\n\nAnd then follow the guide from Cleanup.\nHope this works!\n\nA: Those instructions on the wiki are extremely outdated and these days, quite complicated when there are tools such as Ubuntu Builder available. Since you are customizing Gnome, I highly recommend you follow the steps in this answer which explicitly discusses easily customizing the 12.04 LiveCD with Gnome-Classic.\nAs for your questions, here are the answers:\n\n\n*\n\n*1, 2, 3: no longer necessary with Ubuntu-Builder, see answer.\n\n*4 - Backgrounds: see answer, section 5. Customization 2: Backgrounds and Themes\n\n*5, 6, 7 - kernel update: see answer, simply run sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get dist-upgrade in the text chroot started from Ubuntu-Builder\n\n*8 - Gnome-Classic instead of or in addition to Unity: see answer, section 3. Updating, adding Gnome Classic and other package management\n\n*9 - gdm: see answer, run sudo apt-get install gdm from UB chroot, and select it instead of lightdm in the dpkg popup\n\n\nA: *\n\n*1 - it is OK, iso's are supposed to be mounted read-only.\n\n*2,3 - you mainly change edit, as this is where you \"chroot\". Nevertheless, when you update the kernel, you have to \"dump\" the kernel and the initrd.img-... that you install inside the chroot at /edit/boot/... into the casper folder, inside the \"extract-cd\". \nSo, to update kernel:\nInside chroot, do an apt-get install linux-mage-XXX-whatever to get a new kernel version. This installs two things: a linux-image-XXX-whatever kernel image and a initrd-XXX-whatever inside your /boot directory (when outside the chroot, this directory will be edit/boot). If you blindly follow the wiki, first of all, and dump these two into extract-cd/casper, there are two problems with your initrd: one is it is compressed with gzip (extension .gz), and you need it as an initrd.lz (compressed with lzma), and second, the initrd that came when you installed the new kernel package may not have the squashfs module support to allow reading your live-cd. Both these problems are solved from inside the chroot (when the \"edit\" folder temporarily becomes your \"root\" environment, by generating a new initrd.lz using mkinitramfs  for the new kernel version that you want to update to. This solves both problems, with one shot. \n\n*5 Should be done from outside the chroot environment, after you got the relevant files working inside the chroot (see my comment above)\n\n*6 It is done outside the chroot, but only if you really want to add new modules and maybe other stuff to your initrd. Otherwise stick to my comment above, to regenerate an initrd.lz with mkinitramfs.\n\n*7 As mnt is read-only, you do not do anything there. Everything is/was already copied off to either \"edit\" (the de-compressed squash-fs file) or to \"extract-cd\". You need to update extract-cd/casper such that vmlinuz and initrd.lz there are actually the new versions you want.\n", "Q: Connecting Asus USB-N13 Wireless Adapter I'm trying to connect my desktop (running 64-bit Ubuntu 12.04) to an Airport Extreme Base Station by using an ASUS USB-N13 wireless adapter.\nI plugged it in, turned on the desktop, and the adapter was immediately recognized by the system.

Ensure you have the correct Security Encryption set up and if possible (before you do the following) disable the encryption & security on the router and check if it connects fine without the security key. If it works without the security then try changing the security to some other form that works for you. You may also want to try a different WiFi Channel on the router before you proceed with resolving this further using the following.\nIf not, check out this link http://act28.blogspot.com.au/2011/06/how-to-get-asus-usb-n13-adapter-working.html\n", "Q: Installing Ubuntu on older computer I am trying to install ubuntu on an older dell desktop from a CD.

I have been fighting an annoying problem with my sound set up for a while now, and it's suddenly taken a turn for the worst. I don't know if this situation is related or not, but I think it might be a new problem, so I'm starting a new question.\nAs described in my other question, every time I start a YouTube (or any online video), I have to restart my Pulseaudio server. However, this last time I did it, my Pulseaudio server never came back.\nWhen I look at my sound settings, this is all I get:\n\nThis is what my sound settings were before:\n\nHow do I get my sound device back again?\n\nA: Maybe pulseaudio isn't running or not running correctly. Try removing the pulsaudio configuration by renaming (for safety) the ~/.pulse directory (it's in your home folder).  This will cause it to generate a new setup next time.  This procedure got it back for me when it failed when I removed a pulseaudio equalizer module I was trying out.\n\nA: Turns out the problem was that the server, when rebooting, was not completely logging in automatically to the right user account.\nI was not aware of this, but apparently for the Pulseaudio server to become available on the network, the right user has to be logged in on the server. I would have thought for the machine to be on would be enough.\nAnyway, this has been resolved by ensuring the server is logged in to the correct user account after each reboot.\n", "Q: How do I set up an Ubuntu FTP server?

I have a backup with most of the files.  How do I restore the permissions of the files & folders on the copy using the backup?  \nIt would be very tedious to go in and do chmod XXX filename every single item in there.\n\nA: You can use stat to query the mode on your backup file, and chmod to update your working files. Do this in a loop, with a little string manipulation, and you have a solution. Something like this should work to copy the permissions:\n# path to the top level of the backup\nbackup_dir=/path/to/backup/dir\n\n# path to the directory of files that you want to restore\n# permissions on.\ndir=/path/to/working/dir\n\nfind \"$backup_dir\" |\nwhile read backup_file\ndo\n    new_file=\"$dir${backup_file#$backup_dir}\"\n    chmod --reference=\"$backup_file\" \"$new_file\"\ndone\n\nNote that this won't work well if your filenames contain the newline character (but thats's pretty rare). Also, it's untested, so you may want to do a \"dry-run\" by changing 'chmod' to 'echo chmod', so it just prints what it would do.\n\nA: What backup system are you using?  If it is Ubuntu backup, you can restore the original using nautilus.  Right-click in the parent folder and choose \"Restore missing files\" from the menu.\n\nA: use cp -a or more generally cp --preserve=all\nfrom the man page \n\n       --preserve[=ATTR_LIST]\n              preserve  the  specified  attributes   (default:   mode,owner‐\n              ship,timestamps),  if possible additional attributes: context,\n              links, xattr, all\n\n\nchmod also has a recursive (-R) option.\n", "Q: How do I list all storage devices (thumb drives/external hard drives) that are connected via USB, from the command line?

Here is a command that should list only storage devices attached via USB. One exception, which is likely not to matter to anyone is that this will not display connected USB optical drives with mounted media.\nRequirements for this to work\n\n\n*\n\n*USB devices must be mounted.

All problems solved.\nNow, for the fun part:\nUsing the 3G connection using this dongle on my Lubuntu 12.04 netbook and connecting to my wireless TP-LINK N 300 router to get internet connection to all the computers on the network.\n3G dwm 156 DONGLE -->> LUBUNTU NETBOOK -->> ETHERNET PORT OUT -->> CAT5/CAT6 CABLE -->> WAN PORT OF TP-LINK WIRELESS N ROUTER -->> GETTING INTERNET CONNECTION ON 4 ROUTER PORTS AND WIFI -->> getting connection on my desktop computer using D-link wifi dongle DWA 131.\nHere is the procedure:\n\n\n*\n\n*From my Lubuntu 12.04 netbook, enable 3G connection using dwm 156 and check internet connection.\n\n*Connect my ethernet port of my netbook to wan port of router.\n\n*Open network-manager on netbook.\n\n*Go to wired connection 1 (eth0) and press the edit button.\n\n*Go to IPv4 settings: enable- \"shared to other computers\".\n\n*Save.\n\n*Reboot the router and netbook.\nDone!\nNOW if you get connection-disconnected error do the following:\nOpen a terminal and type: \nsudo su\n\nAnd enter your password, then type:\nkillall  dnsmasq\n\nDone!\nIf need be, check your router's wan IP settings.\nNow I'm sharing internet connection using D-link DWM 156 with 7 computers.\n\nA: 11.10\nFirst of all, it sounds like your hardware isn't currently supported, so your best option would be to file a bug report by running ubuntu-bug linux (this should gather some information about your system).  If the developers don't know about your problem then they won't be able to make the hardware work out of the box.\nFrom what you've described, it sounds like your modem is a \"mode switch\" style device.  These devices pretend to be a storage device holding the Windows drivers when plugged in.  The Windows drivers send a special command to the device that causes it to reset and provide a different set of capabilities.\nIt is likely that Linux has a driver that can handle the device after the reset, but just doesn't know how to perform the reset.\nThe usb_modeswitch command is responsible for performing this job, but it doesn't appear to have any configuration for your device.  There is configuration info for two other D-Link DWM-156 devices with different USB IDs though, and they appear to use the same mode switch message, so it might be worth sending that message and see what happens.  The following command should achieve this:\nsudo usb_modeswitch -v 0x2001 -p 0xa80b --message-content 5553424312345678000000000000061b000000020000000000000000000000\n\nWith any luck, your device may have changed USB IDs and may even have a driver bound to it.  The device might even be visible to NetworkManager at this point.  If you're unlucky, the device might hang and need to be unplugged and replugged.\nIf this does work, include the command in your bug report along with the USB vendor/product IDs of the device before and after the switch.\n\nA: For ubuntu 13.04:\nsame procedure as 12.04.\nJust be sure to do the following:-->\nUninstall usb_modeswitch completely from your system(do it from command line or software centre)\nInstall ia32-libs on a 64 bit install of 13.04(around 84MB of downloads required)\n\nsudo apt-get install ia32-libs\n\nFollow the steps from 12.04 for the rest..\n\nA: Dont know if this is helpful..\nTHe dwm-156 is plug n play with tplink mr3420.\nThe dwm-156 is plug n play with tplink mr3020 but with the latest BIOS update from tplink website.\n", "Q: How to avoid entering keychain password How to avoid entering keychain password, without disabling autologin?\n\nA: You can use insecure storage, but you really shouldn't do that, as it means someone could steal your computer and get your passwords, which totally defeats the point of using a secure keychain/password safe.\nIf your keychain password is the same as your login password, which is should be, and it seems like it is, then logging in will also unlock your keychain.\n\nA: If you are using Ubuntu 13.10 - open keychain application (named seahorse), click view and click the first option, which means sort or smth (sorry I`m using Russian distro and dont know exact names).

Luckily, I have a full backup of my previous file system. However, I don't know what folders exactly I need to restore (except the home folder, of course), since restoring the wrong files might damage the new files that came with the fresh installation. \nI suppose that if I understand what each folder is used for, I can know whether it makes sense to restore it. Specifically, I would like to know about the following folders:\n\n\n*\n\n*/boot - What is it? Should I restore it? (my 12.04 computer currently boots OK).\n\n*/etc - contains a lot of folders, most of them also exist on my 12.04 computer. Should I just restore all the /etc folder? Should I do it before or after I install the relevant applications?\n\n*/etc/apache2 - I changed some configurations. However, the I already installed apache2 on my 12.04 computer, and the configuration files look different. Probably the new version of apache2 has some new configurations. Should I just merge each file manually?     same question with /etc/mysql.\n\n*/var/backups - Contains some files I don't recognize, such as aptitude.pkgstates., dpkg.status., group.bak, shadow.bak, etc. Most of them already exist on my new /var/backup .

Should I restore them?\n\n*/var/lib - again, many folders that I don't recognize. Specifically:\n\n*/var/lib/mysql - contains my old databases. Is it safe to just copy all of them? Should I do this before or after I re-install MySQL? Are they compatible with the new version?

I've managed to set up my three monitors using ATI's Catalyst Control Center.\nHowever, I run into problems when I try to maximize windows to my middle monitor - namely, it seems impossible. Modifying the realtive positions of the monitors using CCC seems to temporarily fix the problem, but the \"solution\" does not persist over restarts.\nHow can I fix this?\nThanks.\n\nA: You can go to the display settings and turn on the \"Sticky Edges\" option and it should cause your mouse to stick to the edge before moving to the next monitor thus allowing for the function to work. It is quite buggy doing this as sometimes your mouse won't go to the next monitor and just well sticks. You can also try turning on the Xinerama (or something like that) and see if that will do it for you. Your last option is to reconfigure your \"Monitor's Emulated Position\". Meaning in the \"X\" settings you should be able to drag and drop monitor 1,2, or 3 in the middle,left, or right side.

A quick googling did not help me much.\nHow do fix it and get it installed.\n\nA: You said:\n\nwe can install ubuntu 12.04 but it disappears once we restart it and model is inspiron 5423 ultrabook. I am trying for a dual boot version, i mean to run ubuntu along with windows\n\nIf you are booting from an Ubuntu live CD/DVD or live USB flash drive and running the installer, and it appears to succeed, but when you remove the installation media and restart you just boot into Windows without an option to select Ubuntu, this usually means the GRUB2 boot loader was not properly installed to the Master Boot Record.\nThe solution to that is to reinstall GRUB2 to the MBR. You can choose whichever method you prefer. Because they're easiest, I recommend either using the Boot Repair GUI utility or using this method.\nIf that doesn't work, then we definitely will need more information to answer your question. Here's the information we need:\n\n\n*\n\n*How, exactly, did you install Ubuntu? Provide as much detail as possible.\n\n*In particular, if you installed Ubuntu inside Windows using Wubi, the above instructions will not help you, and you'll have to tell us that.\n\n*Boot from the live CD, open a Terminal window (Ctrl+Alt+T), and run sudo parted -l. Select all the text in the Terminal window, copy it to the clipboard, and edit your question, pasting it into your question and formatting it with the <$> tool in the Ask Ubuntu editing toolbar. (You should be able to access the Internet from the live CD system to do this.)\n\n\nA: I had a similar problem. The problem was that the boot loader for Ubuntu was in the SSD memory, so I had to go to the setup and choose the SSD (secondary HDD) as the primary boot device.\n\nA: I was forced to do research project on DELL Inspiron 14z. It install 12.04 okay. But if you looked in dmesg, you would see 2 messages that indicate big problems. One had to with power regulation. The other had to do graphic driver. The messages exhibited in computer shutting off on temperature of CPU. And also random freezes of display in a very unique way because the mouse cursor moved but everything else was frozen. Different kernel versions behave differently on these two problems. My only suggestion is check kernel.log and dmesg and start there if you see any error messages.\n\nA: Download Precise from http://releases.ubuntu.com/12.04/\nCreate an Image from ISO in Window(the file you have downloaded)[Burning the cd]\nMake sure you set the boot from CD in your bios setup.\nThen boot the cd and follow the instruction.\nPlease make sure you make a swap partition along with root for better performance.\n\nA: You have to install Ubuntu in Legacy Mode while the Windows running in UEFI mode.\nTo access Windows again you will have to change\nthe boot mode to UEFI and when you want to access Ubuntu you've to change to Legacy Mode.\n", "Q: How to install Thunderbird in old version Ubuntu 9.xx?

For various reasons, one being that I like it more, I want to run Dolphin as my default file manager in stock Ubuntu 12.04. I've installed dolphin.\nI've done:\nsudo mv /usr/bin/nautilus /usr/bin/natilus.back && sudo ln -s /usr/bin/dolphin /usr/bin/nautilus\n\nwhich makes any program calling Nautilus open Dolphin instead. This is all fine and dandy so far but dolphin wants to call konsole as the default terminal but I would like to make it call gnome-terminal as default instead.\nI tried:\nsudo ln -s /usr/bin/gnome-terminal /usr/bin/konsole\n\nmaking a link of gnome-terminal called konsole, but that did not work. I don't get an error from Dolphin anymore but just nothing happens. The terminal panel is just blank.\nAnyone know how to do this, or if there is a better way to implement dolphin as default FM I'm all ears. \n\nUPDATE 20120727\nSince then I realized that I had not used a sym link in the first place. Instead, I used a more clever approach \n\n\n*\n\n*Make a folder in your home directory called bin\nmkdir ~/bin\n\n\n*Make a script called Nautilus that executes Dolphin and put it in this folder\ngedit ~/bin/nautilus\n\nThen copy this code into it and save\n#!/bin/bash\nexec dolphin $@\nexit 0\n\nThis is the safest way to make Dolphin your default browser, as well as going into the /usr/share/applications folder and changing the 3 nautilus .desktop files to launch Dolphin instead of Nautilus.\nBUT this does not fix the two problems Dolphin has\n\n\n*\n\n*it wants to launch the konsole terminal instead of gnome-terminal.\n\n*it's icons are hideous and qt4-qtconfig can not change them.\n\n\n\nUPDATE 20120810\nTo fix the ugly oxygen icons to match your system theme, qt4-qtconfig tool is not sufficient.

THANKS TO YOU ALL!!\n\nA: There are several caveats in what you tried to do. I already mentioned the danger introduced by your approach:\n\nNext time nautilus is going to be updated, your dolphin gets overwritten (as your link points there). Same goes for gnome-terminal.\n\nSo we figured, this was not a good idea :)\nBut there are some ways to try working around, so \"x\" gets run when \"z\" was requested -- but I'm not aware of any as soon not \"z\", but \"/full/path/to/z\" gets called. As long as it is just \"z\":\n\n\n*\n\n*creating an alias for z, like alias z=x (works on a per-user-level -- or globally, depending on where it was defined)\n\n*creating a \"replacement\" for z in a location mentioned in the PATH before the location the real z resides in\n\n\nA little more details on the second approach. Taking your original problem, you want to have dolphin executed whenever nautilus is called upon. You already found nautilus at /usr/bin/nautilus. Now let's (probably correctly) assume your $PATH contains (in this order) /usr/local/bin:/usr/bin -- so you see /usr/local/bin would be searched before /usr/bin. So we simply create a shell script /usr/local/bin/nautilus with the following content:\n#!/bin/bash\n/usr/bin/dolphin %$@\n\nSo what will happen? If you (or some script/program/daemon/...) invokes nautilus, this will execute /usr/local/bin/nautilus (as this is the first \"nautilus\" found in the PATH), which simply starts /usr/bin/dolphin -- voila! But if the \"whatever\" uses the full path, this won't work.\nSo you say: Hey, why didn't Izzy say \"just do a ln -s /usr/bin/dolphin /usr/local/bin/nautilus?\" Sure you can do that -- and it will work the same. But using a script as shown may come in handy if you need to introduce additional parameters which are not passed with the original call. With above script, dolphin simply gets passed the same parameters the original call used (%$@). But you can play around with things in the script, replace parameters, etc. As for your current problem, the link would be enough (as long as nautilus doesn't get called with the full path).\n\nA: consider using plasma-desktop and you can pick whatever application you want for each mime-type/file-association.\nsee my other answer on a related question.\nKDE - Dolphin: Open tab in new window instead of new tab\n", "Q: Eclipse sans font is not readable Ubuntu 12.04, Oracle Java 7, Eclipse Indigo/Juno.

I am currently in the process of reinstalling my laptop. I've been using Ubuntu so far, and now would like to install openSUSE additionally.\nI will use both OS's with mostly the same application (i. e. GNOME 3 ones largely, plus Mozilla stuff and LibreOffice).\nCan I just create a /home partition that's used by both OS's and expect it to work or is it likely there are complications?\n\nA: There will definitely be complications unless you choose separate users for Ubuntu and SUSE. If it's the same username, you will have problems with your user configurations being overwritten, conflicting and what not, even if you are using \"more or less\" the same programs.\n\nA: Trying to use the same home directory for two different distros out of the box will likely cause complications.\nOne possibility is to make a partition that is sort of a home partition, but contains only the data for the applications you wish to share between distros. Then you can create symbolic links to the appropriate files/directories in the appropriate places in your separate home directories in each distro.\nFor example, if you use an app that in one distro stores its config in ~/.foo, and in the other stores it in ~/.bar, you can create one directory in your new partition, called /mnt/baz/myapp, and then just ln -s /mnt/baz/myapp ~/.foo in the first distro and ln -s /mnt/baz/myapp ~/.bar in the second.\nIt sounds complicated, but I use the same sort of setup to share certain portions of my home directory (Downloads, Documents, Music, Pictures) among a couple of different Ubuntu releases, and put them on an HDD so I can run the rest off a smaller SSD for speed.\n", "Q: Sometimes Windows 7 NAS cannot be mounted I can successfully connect my Xubuntu PC (cable-connected to office network) to a Windows NAS using this line in /etc/fstab:\n//Hall/Share /media/HallShare cifs credentials=/root/.smbcredentials,iocharset=utf8,file_mode=0777,dir_mode=0777 0 0\n\nAnd running:\nsudo mount -a\n\nThe mount is automatic on boot.\nThe problem is that often (but not always) when I turn on my PC, NAS is not mounted (that is /media/HallShare is empty and sudo mount -l doesn't list anything related to this folder).

Since I'm new into programming for Linux I still have some questions:\n1) I have some dependencies (e.g. BLAST). I read that I can configure in Quickly the dependencies that they will be automatically installed with my tool. What I have to add into the file, the link, the name of the tool or something else? An example would be great.\n2) Those dependencies produce several (large) output files. Where such files are created and should I move them into my application folder for parsing them?\n3) My application creates several files. Where is the best place for storing them in the folder structure of my app created from quickly? How about read and write accessibility of the files?\n4) Any other tips or suggestions about I have to take care or which are different from Windows OS?\nAny help is very appreciated!\n\nA: I am the Developer (and packager) of Wallch, which is a C++ application and thus it is not build and packaged with Quickly.\nFor that reason my answer will include general information about your questions that (should) apply in any case (as far as I know).\nAnswering your questions, now:\n(1)\nYou can set as your application's dependencies, only the ones that are at the default repositories of Ubuntu. You may not include dependencies from PPAs etc. You can add your dependencies at the debian/control file. An example debian/control file for my application is the following: paste.ubuntu.com/1113694.\nAs you can see, there are 2 'Depends' fields, in the Build-Depends you have to specify what is essential for building your application. I am pretty sure that Quickly should fill this field automatically. The other packages that are important for running your application should be listed under the Depends field. This is were you have to specify any extra dependencies that you have. What you have to specify is the package-name that the user should download and install (this process is automatic, of course)\n(2)\nThe dependencies, as far as I understand from your question, are separate programs who can run and produce big output files. Now, it really depends where those files are being stored. I would say that:\n\n\n*\n\n*If your application indirectly creates those big output files, you can select to save them anywhere you like\n\n*If the user separately produces these files, then you can let the user from inside your application to select one of these files for processing.\nIt really depends on how these files are being produced and what they have to do with your application.\nIf you just create some files and then you want to process them with your application, then you should use the /tmp directory. Run the dependency-program and guide it to generate the files to /tmp and then have your program read and parse the files from there.\n(3)\nAs far as I know (because I participated at this specific contest as well), the structure that Quickly creates lays under /opt/extras.ubuntu.com/programname, where the user doesn't have write permissions. This means that if the user normally opens your application and, from within your application, you have chosen to save your program's files under /opt/extras.ubuntu.com/programname, the user will not be able to save those files. Instead, he will have to run your application with root privileges, which is generally discouraged.\nAgain, it depends what those files are for. Are those files readable from the user or they are only usable from within your application (something like configuration files)? If the former is true, then you should let the user choose where to save those files. If the latter is true, then you should place those files under ~/.config/ProgramName/\nThe directory ~/.config/ProgramName is a directory where all applications save their configuration files.\nEdit after more requests from comment:\nGenerally, in your occassion, you should do the following:\n\n\n*\n\n*Your program generates files depending on user input (which result into ~/.config/ProgName because they might be reused and should not be deleted)\n\n*The tools you depend on read these files (from ~/.config/ProgName) and generate some other files (who result into /tmp)\n\n*Your program takes the generated files (from the tools) from /tmp and does any calculation/drawing etc... After doing what your application has to do with the final files under /tmp, it would be good to delete them.\n\n\nAs for whether you have read/write permissions at the configuration folder, the user has full read/write permissions in everything under ~/ (your home directory), and thus, everything under ~/.config/ belongs to him as well.\nNote that the user has read/write permissions under /tmp, as well.\nTip: You can use the mktemp command so as to generate temp files under /tmp with random name\n", "Q: Portable virtual machine with preinstalled Ubuntu for Windows? I download \"Damn Small Linux (DSL)\" distribution from (http://ftp.belnet.be/packages/damnsmalllinux/current/dsl-4.4.10-embedded.zip) and this distribution has a very interesting version called \"Embedded\" that has QEMU with a DSL virtualmachine already setup and ready to use by just running a simple .bat file in Windows just like an application.\nSo I was wondering, is there any QEMU ready setup with an Ubuntu virtual machine ready to use? I don't want to install anything because I want it on my office PC as an application that I can run and play with.\nI know the existence of WUBI, VirtualBox, VMWare, but again, I don't want to install anything, I'm looking for the same behavior as the DSL Embeded but running Ubuntu.\n\nA: Well, you can create a Live-USB using LinuxLiveUSB-Creator which includes a ready-to-run portable Virtualbox for Windows to immediate use the Live Ubuntu.\n\n\n*\n\n*No installation is required (well, except for the USB creator program :)\n\n*Virtualbox is better supported, easier to use and has more features than qemu on Windows\n\n*You can always copy the contents of the LiveUSB to your hard-disk for a more permanent/faster Virtual Live-Ubuntu\n\n", "Q: How to get graphical display when executing commands as another user, through terminal? In my terminal, I did\n $su nextuser\n\nand logged in to that account. Now, when I try to open a text file in the home directory of that user by\n$gedit test.c\n\nI get\nNo protocol specified\nCannot open display: \nRun 'gedit --help' to see a full list of available command line options.\n\nHow can I use the graphical text editor to display files on the new user's account?\n\nA: As root, run\necho $DISPLAY\nxhost local:nextuser\n\nThen\nsu - nextuser\nexport DISPLAY=<the value got from echo $DISPLAY above>\n(or SET DISPLAY.. if export does not work)\n\nAnd you are good to go. :)\n\nA: Running Graphical Commands from Another User's Shell\nThe sux  command (see man sux) takes care of this for you, and takes the same syntax as su.\nsux - nextuser\ngedit test.c\n\nThis will automatically ensure the .Xauthority is correct, so you don't have to run any commands to manually authorize anything.\nGraphical applications tend to write configuration files in your home directory, and if you run them as another user while preserving $HOME, they'll attempt to write configuration files as that user, in your home directory. This will result in failing to write the configuration, or the configuration getting messed up for the original user (or some combination of the two). That's why it's advisable to use the - flag with sux (or su) when running graphical applications. (For sudo, you can instead use graphical frontends like gksu/gksudo and kdesudo.)\nRunning Graphical Commands Directly as Another User\nYou can use gksu in su-mode (with the -w flag) to run the command as another user (with the -u flag):\ngksu -w -u nextuser gedit test.c\n\nHowever, you might still have to run xhost local:nextuser first (as you detailed in your quite good answer) for this to work. It's less likely to need that if you use sudo-mode, but then you can only do it if you're an administrator (and you'll be authenticating with your password rather than nextuser's password, as sudo rather than su is the backend):\ngksu -u nextuer gedit test.c\n\nRunning the Terminal (Not Just the Shell) as Another User\nYou may just want to run the graphical Terminal program (that the shell runs \"inside\") as the other user. Once it's running, graphical programs launched from it will work seamlessly as well.\nYou can use the same methods described above for running gedit as the other user.\ngksu -w -u nextuser gnome-terminal\ngksu -u nextuser gnome-terminal\n\n\nA: Use the -p option with su to preserve environment variables including DISPLAY; alternately set it explicitly with export or prefix it on a per command basis. \n", "Q: What permission do I need to add an HP printer with hp-setup?

I know I can download emails using a client, but is there a way to download emails straight from the terminal? I'm trying to fetch some emails from my gmail to later do some analysis on certain emails. \nEDIT: Thank you for all the answers. Right now, I found a way to do it with getmail. But I encountered a small issue. It downloads the emails and attachments, but it prints everything in text. Is there a way to actually retrieve said attachment?\n\nA: Gmail provides an IMAP service through which you can use any client that supports that protocol to fetch your e-mails. How that client makes them available on the disk can vary.\nBy far the most widely-used command-line IMAP client has to be fetchmail. You can install it easily in Ubuntu, then google for specific configurations to use with gmail.\nOne thing with fetchmail is that it slurps emails from the remote server and then pipes them through your local MTA. So you'd need to have a locally-configured MTA for this setup to work. The MTA would presumably then append the emails to /var/mail/$USER, and you can then read this file to do your processing.\nAnother tool that may work is offlineimap. I haven't used it; setup may be easier than with fetchmail.\nAs for your need to save attachments included in emails, what you need is to install mpack. Then, run the munpack command on the .txt file for each email (yes, the one that contains all the gibberish from the attachments). It will decode and save the attachments in individual files:\n$ munpack mail.txt \nInvoice.PDF (application/pdf)\nmy-picture.png (image/png)\n\n\nA: (The question was about generally accessing email via the terminal, before the question poser specified getmail, but attachments are easily saved in Mutt also: see my note below)\nYou could use the program Mutt, which is available in the repositories. I have found that Mutt is highly configurable and fairly straightforward once you get used to it. The following instructions refer to setting it up for gmail using the imap and smtp protocols (make sure imap is enabled in your gmail account settings ).\nIt takes a little while to set up, but here's basically the quickest way to do it:\n\n\n*\n\n*Make a directory called .mutt and within that create another one called cache\n\n*Next create a file called .muttrc to store your settings, although this does not go in the .mutt folder, but just in your home folder. Then enter the following settings in there; for the password I have left it \"\" so that you are prompted, as it's not a good idea to put your password in a plain text file like .muttrc. (Note: these settings are based on the Linux Format article on Mutt, LXF134, August 2010, pp. 96-97.)\nset from = \"username@gmail.com\"\nset realname = \"Your Name\"\nset imap_user = \"username@gmail.com\"\nset imap_pass = \"\"\nset folder = \"imaps://imap.gmail.com:993\"\nset spoolfile = \"+INBOX\"\nset postponed = \"+[Gmail]/Drafts\"\nset trash = \"imaps://imap.gmail.com/[Gmail]/Trash\"\nset header_cache=~/.mutt/cache/headers\nset message_cachedir=~/.mutt/cache/bodies\nset smtp_url = \"smtp://username@smtp.gmail.com:587/\"\nset smtp_pass = \"\"\nset move = no\nset imap_keepalive = 900\nset sort=threads\nset sort_aux=date\n\nNow with your settings saved in .muttrc, just type mutt in the terminal and enter your password when prompted. I have tested these settings and they work fine; look around for more settings to customise your Mutt experience, as macros can be used with the program to give it extra functionality. See the Mutt manual for this and more, which is also installed when you get the program. \nTo open attachments, select the message with the attachment, press v, select the attachment and press enter to view it in your default application. To save the attachment instead press s to save and enter a file name and location and press enter.\n\n\nA: You could use OfflineIMAP.\n\nOfflineIMAP traditionally operates by maintaining a hierarchy of mail\n  folders in Maildir format locally. Your own mail reader will read mail\n  from this tree, and need never know that the mail comes from IMAP.\n  OfflineIMAP will detect changes to the mail folders on your IMAP\n  server and your own computer and bi-directionally synchronize them,\n  copying, marking, and deleting messages as necessary.\n\nIt's in the universe repository, so you may need to enable that first, then install:\nofflineimap\n", "Q: How to change default action when running a .sh file? Every time I want to run a .sh file, Ubuntu asks whether I want to Run in Terminal/Display/Run it.

Have been using apt-fast for a while now and really liking it. In case you don't know it is useful to speed up apt-get. However, I have a few questions regarding apt-fast:\n\n\n*\n\n*I would like to make any call to apt-get run apt-fast.

Is this possible?\n\nA: apt-fast does not make 'apt-get update' faster. If you'll check the code, e.g. \nvi /usr/bin/apt-fast\n\nYou'll find the line: \nif echo \"$@\" | grep -q \"upgrade\\|install\\|dist-upgrade\"; then\n...\nelse\napt-get \"@\"\n\nWhich means that apt-fast does nothing in all other commands except in upgrade, install, and dist-upgrade. \n\nA: You can create an alias for apt-get in your home directory. To do so, follow these:\n\n\n*\n\n*Open a terminal and do this command:\ntouch ~/.bash_aliases; gedit ~/.bash_aliases\n\n\n*In the new opened file, type these and save and exit.\nalias apt-get='apt-fast'\n\nThen, whenever you run apt-get, apt-fast will run instead\nFor more info, see this page\n\n\n*\n\n*http://modifyubuntu.com/#terminal\n", "Q: Can i Install Ubuntu on my SDCARD and improve performance?

I never use my card-reader for anything, but i have a 32GB SD-card that i do not use really. I was then wondering if installing Ubuntu on that SD-card will improve my performance much? Would it be like SSD\n\nA: By experience, I can tell you that running Ubuntu on a SD card is usually unbearably slow. You won't get anywhere near SSD-like performance. This is due to the read and write speed limitations of SD cards and card readers.\nInstalling on a USB flash drive would give you at least equal, and most likely significantly better, performance.\nPlease note that I am only speaking from personal experience.\n\nA: Worth noting that there's SD cards now that have R/W speeds of up 260MB/240MB per sec, respectively: See this article\n\nA: I have done this and the result wasn't pleasant(read: it was slow).

How can I proceed?\nAs a side note I would prefer not having to reformat the hard drive as for I have a few files that I need to affirm that I have backups of.\n\nA: You might try dropping into a shell and chrooting to rescue the installation.  Here's a link: http://administratosphere.wordpress.com/2011/11/02/rescuing-an-interrupted-ubuntu-upgrade/\nYou could boot into a rescue shell, or use the CD.  If you use the CD, make sure you mount all your partitions.  Then open a terminal and chroot to your installation:\nie, type (replace with appropriate path): \nchroot [pathtoMountedInstallation] /bin/bash\n\nThat will change the terminal to think that your installation is the root.  Then you can:\nsudo dpkg --configure\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get dist-upgrade\n\nHopefully that will work, but it may depend on when the upgrade failed.\n", "Q: Getting Google Talk/Skype to Work with Pulseaudio Google Talk/Skype will not transmit my voice.

I'd like to download movie torrents from my Ubuntu server as its download speed is much higher than at home. However, it is pretty pointless if I then have to download the movie from my server to my laptop so I thought a good compromise would be to stream the movies. What is the easiest way to do so? My only requirements are that everything on the server side should be done through the command line (ssh) and if possible, minimal dependencies. My media player is VLC but I wouldn't mind using a web browser to watch the videos.\nRelated question: how do i stream a video in my server to my computer?\n\nA: use ssh -X with xauth, and run vlc on the server. It's fairly easy to stream videos using vlc. Howver this solution uses too much bandwidth to be usable.\nWhat you should use instead is a network filesystem, just hit ctrl-l in nautilus, and then type sftp://user@my-server:port/folder and open up your movies directly off the server.

I just installed ubuntu but I cant find the files that I had on windows? \n\nA: Point 1:\nUbuntu and Windows are different Operating system. The softwares that work on One operation system may or may not work on another operating system (OS).\nGenerally, If two OS can run and recognize same binary program/files, both of them can run that software. But, those files/programs need to be binary compatible. But, programs for Windows and Ubuntu's are not binari compatibles and hence they are different. So, You can't run your Windows programs on Ubuntu (except with the help of some emulation software such as WINE).\nPoint 2:\nEven if You install another copy of Windows in another parititon in the same Computer, you will not find your installed programs (except the default programs automatically installed by Windows). Because, You have done installation in a new partition. Also, installing Windows again on the same drive will not help.\nSo, It is clear, If you install Ubuntu, you can't find the Windows programs in it. If you installed in another partition (other than Windows), You can still boot on Windows. If you installed Ubuntu on the same partition as Windows, You replaced Windows and you will never find those old Windows program.\n\nSee these links to get an idea about OSes, Difference between Windows and Ubuntu.\n\n*\n\n*Operating system\n\n*Ubuntu - Operation System\n\n*Windows - Operation System\nAnd also see these to get a general introduction to Ubuntu and Linux:\n\n*\n\n*Ubuntu Linux Resources\n\n*Linux Newbie Guide\n\nSee these links to get help on Using both Windows and Ubuntu on the same computer:\n\n*\n\n*How to dual boot with Windows 7 on an Ubuntu-only system?\n\n*Dual boot Ubuntu and Windows 7\n", "Q: Why is Wifi not working on my HP laptop?

However, I do not know how to dualboot Ubuntu on this, because of two reasons:\n\n\n*\n\n*It is a hybrid 500GB HDD + 30GB SSD, therefore the OS has to be smart enough to use the SSD to speed things up. But what does this mean when selecting partitions etc. while installing Ubuntu next to Windows 7?\n\n*It does not have an optical drive; windows 7 is preinstalled.\nWhat steps should I follow to dualboot Ubuntu on this correctly? Will this cope with the HDD+SSD hybrid technology?\n\nA: When you get to the part of installation where it asks you to select a hard disk to install ubuntu on and select something else.\n\nSelect your smaller ssd drive and create a new partion from the empty space on that disk (it won't actually look exactly like in the picture since it's a virtual box)\n\nNow select your hdd and make a new partition as big as you want your data partition to be (probably not too big cause windows needs a lot).\n\nFinally on your hdd make a swap partition using 4 or 5 gigabyte\n\nNow at the bottom of the page select your ssd for the bootloader installation and hit 'Install now'\n\nA: Ubuntu doesn't have to be smart. It's you who decide where you want your Ubuntu installed, in 500G HDD or 30G SSD.\nYou need to know which partition is the one where you  want to install Ubuntu, then within the Ubuntu installation you should choose that partition, choosing that you want Ubuntu runnin along Windows.\nAfter that, everytime you boot your laptop, you'll be giving a menu (GRUB) so you can choose what Operating System to boot.\nBecause you don't have an optical drive you can boot Ubuntu from a USB pen or install Ubuntu from within Windows.\nhttp://www.ubuntu.com/download/desktop\n\nA: Yes, I realise the question is old, but is also one of the first Google results when searching dual boot on this machine.\nAs the iSSD is used as a cache by Windows, you don't want to install Ubuntu there unless you disable the Windows cache.\nAs the comment on your question says, the hdd is not cached like that of the Seagate XT drives, but is two distinct drives: ssd on the motherboard, and hdd. Windows is set up to use the SSD as a cache.\nYou have a couple of options:\n\n\n*\n\n*Install Ubuntu on the hdd alongside the Windows install by creating a new partition and installing to that. Ubuntu should be able to use the SSD as a cache, but not sure.\n\n*Turn off the caching in Windows and put ubuntu on the ssd using the method shown by Daniel.\n\n\nEither way, you'll want a swap on the HDD (on the SSD will kill longevity) as well as a dedicated Linux data partition - Ubuntu can read/write ntfs, but is generally not a good idea to take that for granted.\nHere's some partitioning advice - when creating partitions, Linux will need at least / and swap ( or you can use a swap file). It's generally considered a good idea to also have a separate data, or /home. This is for a couple of reasons: if you need to reinstall the OS ( and this goes (especially?!) for Windows as well), you don't then have to go backing everything up and transferring hundreds of GB of data, and; if you fill the data partition then it won't mean a lack of space for Linux to do its required operations in /, in which case it might fall over in a heap. Some Linux admins will advocate having separate /boot, /usr and /var as well, and it is still not a bad idea in the server space where uptime is king, but it's less essential on the desktop.\nIf it's your first foray into Linux, I'd suggest keeping the /home partition small to begin, and at the end of the drive so it's easier to resize later if you want more room.\n\nA: Just as I see the ssd is almost empty my machine boots after I formatted it, but I yet have not been able to boot the linux from ssd, I got the latest 32vd with W8 though. \n", "Q: External hard-drive is \"clicking\" when idle I'm struggling with a very annoying issue: My new hard-drive (Samsung Spinpoint M8 1TB (HN-M101MBB) was build in an USB 3.0 external case (Lian Li EX-10QR) and formatted with ext4. When this hard-drive is connected to my Notebook via USB 2.0 it \"klicks\", the LED flashs too, every second, but only when it's idle! It stays silent, when something is copying or reading from it.

I have 4 partitions on that drive: one swap, one NTFS and two EXT4. The first EXT4 partition has Ubuntu installed on it, the second was a fresh formatted partition and only the second one caused the drive activity. After some experimenting I looked into iotop and saw a process being active on the partition. It turned out to be the journaling process for that drive and after some minutes in idle the drive completely stopped activity. I have transfered 50 GB to the drive and it's silent again after the copy job finished. I believe it just had to build the journal or finish some other maintenance activity after the partition was formatted. I also tried a regular micro USB cable when the drive was busy in idle state with the same result, so it's not a USB 3.0 issue.\n", "Q: Is there any documentation for Nux?

Ubuntu’s dual release cycle\n  provides frequent six-month releases that incorporates the latest\n  open-source innovations and hardware support, while the long-term\n  support (LTS) versions, which are released every two years, provide\n  greater stability for systems that don’t require a high refresh rate.\n\nSix-Month release cycle (kind of Feature-Based Release)\n--ensures that the latest technology updates are brought into a stable, enterprise-grade Ubuntu platform. These standard releases are maintained with security updates and bug fixes for up to 18 months .Ubuntu's regular releases mean you get new technologies, and the ability to use new devices with Ubuntu, faster than any other operating system\nUbuntu long-term support (LTS) release\n--are released every two years. As every IT environment has different classes of machines, the LTS lifecycle was specifically created for those systems in IT environments that require greater stability, rather than a high refresh rate. \nLTS versions are updated every six months in a consolidated point release that makes it easier for organisations to install the current LTS on new hardware without having to download all of the subsequent patches released since the product’s introduction. Point releases are provided until the next full LTS version becomes available. LTS releases are maintained for five years on servers and desktops. \nThe table below summarises the differences between standard and LTS releases.\n\nAn image from a Blog  illustrates the developmental states to bring Stability and security .\n\nUbuntu releases are timed to be approximately one month after GNOME releases, which are in turn about one month after releases of X.Org, resulting in each Ubuntu release including a newer version of GNOME and X.\n\nLinux is the name of Kernel , Ubuntu is fully-fledged Operating System based on Debian branch. It keeps on developing including support for new Hardware , improving performance and New Features (Btrfs for eg.). Of Which newer version gets included and maintained in every new Release. \nAs far a s buying New version of Other OS is concerned , it keeps on updating (Patch tuesday) as  Service packs , which can be distantly compared to LTS Point releases. The new releases don't have specific timeline unlike Ubuntu. ( V***a was a failure , they patched it and fixed as ^seven). Also you have to update manually applications like browsers , Offices apps, AV's ( not required in Ubuntu)  etc. Here you just to click a button and provide a password for updating.\nFrankly if you buy something , then by habit you have to stick to it until newer version arrives. Whereas here you get the best that is available in every Release cycle for Free.\nUsers shouldn't abandon the unsupported release , they should upgrade for better security , stability , and feature purposes , by following Upgrades as simple as updating .\nYes , after EOL support ends ,meaning no Security or package updates , because they are maintaining three Ubuntu Versions at a Time ( correct me if wrong).\nIts upon Users choice if they wants to continue using unsupported release or Newer release , using unsupported  will not damage the system or cause degrading. It will simply refuse to integrate new features and improvements.\n\nUseful links\nA release schedule you can depend on›\nMaintenance and support life cycles\nList of Ubuntu releases\n\nA: I have to say this are all excellent question and I will go through your excellent questions one part at a time with the small knowledge I have about the Ubuntu ecosystem. I have divided your question into several smaller ones:\n1. Does Ubuntu support a particular version with a limited time?\nBefore explaining the time limit for each version (9.10, 11.04, 12.10...) or type of version (Desktop, Server...) we need to first see some variables that are taken into consideration for this time limits. For example, some of them are:\nMan Power / Geek Power / Amount of Developers - This is the amount of geeks, developers and in general people that work in the creation of Ubuntu. This is the amount of people that can put some of their time to work on the upcoming Ubuntu release, the current Ubuntu release and/or a previous version of Ubuntu. Right now, with the time periods for support pushed from Servers to 5 years and Desktop to 5 years in LTS and in normal versions to 2 years, this means that the Ubuntu devs have to work in around 9 versions of Ubuntu. As of this writing the versions of Ubuntu that have support are below (you can see a more current list here): \n\n\n*\n\n*8.04 Server LTS   \n\n*10.04 Desktop  \n\n*10.04 Server LTS   \n\n*11.04 Desktop  \n\n*11.04 Server  \n\n*11.10 Desktop  \n\n*11.10 Server   \n\n*12.04 Desktop  \n\n*12.04 Server LTS  \n\n\nThis does not include the work done in 12.10 which is the upcoming version (As of this writing). So in total, right now, there are 10 versions that are getting support. For what I have seen, the 2 versions that get more support are the 12.04 and 12.10 in a somewhat 70%-80% work for 12.10 and 30%-20% for 12.04. Of course if we take into account the other previous versions of Ubuntu that are getting support it would be something a percent bigger for the upcoming release, followed by the second biggest percent for the current release and then followed by several almost equal percents for each previous version supported. This means in plain english that devs focus more on upcoming and current releases but still do not abandon older, supported ones.\nThe point of all of this is to get a clear look into the amount of work that needs to be done for this 10 versions of Ubuntu to satisfy and to offer support for all the users of each version. With this in mind we jump to the second part.\nHardware Evolution / Software Evolution\nWith time comes new hardware, new software techniques and new innovative and smart ways to create new stuff and to make old stuff better. For example, when Ubuntu 5.10 came out, there was no USB 3.0, Sata 6G or NFC. This also applies to the hardware and software in that time frame. When a motherboard came out, around the time that specific version of Ubuntu came out there was no X hardware invented or developed. There was no GCC with better X properties and Y compiling times.\nThis means that for each new version that comes out, Ubuntu tries to absorb whatever new technology that comes out in the world. This helps the development a lot if the time frame between releases is short, since having a time frame between version of, let us say, 10 years, would mean that it would need to adopt all technologies in that time.. THAT IS A LOT!. Having it in one year also means that users might not get the updates they want or that special version of the program they use in time. A balanced time frame therefore is the release cycle of 6 months. That is why in this example the release cycle is a 6 month time period. So anything that happens in the next 6 months can be applied to the new version (To some degree of peace of mind for the developers I may add).\nBasically we have a time frame that focuses on end users, developers and has an eye on new technology, new ideas, new software. Balanced if I can say so.\nIdeas / New methodology / New techniques\nIn order to apply and work with the 2 points mentioned above, new ideas come out every so often (Can I say every 6 months ^^). So ideas for a better Gnome desktop, for a better way to integrate user actions, for a better and accessible computer experience. Having this also means that ideas that looked nice 2 years ago, might not look so much today, or maybe can be enhanced or changed for others. This affects they way for example the behaviour of a single program up to massive change like the transition from Gnome 2.x to Unity. This are also thought into the plan of development of Ubuntu.\nWith all of this points in mind we can actually say that having the support for each version of Ubuntu limited to an amount of years is a pretty good idea. This would make the developers focus more on applying their time on new technology, new hardware, new software and new and current Ubuntu versions. This might sound like a \"abandon all hope to anyone that has a previous version\" but no. The fact that Ubuntu has support for very old versions, like the 8.04 and even has a Long Term Support option with their Ubuntu versions every 2 years mean that they actually have a plan for older versions. They want to offer security, stability and a sound OS that can deliver when you need it. All of this while thinking of the 10 versions of Ubuntu that get worked done on them.\n2. Do (Very Old) versions still get some kind of support and updates?\nYes. But not all. As I mentioned before, some versions like the 8.04 get support, but this is because they have LTS (Long Term Support) which gives you a guarantee that they will support it for the next 5 years, while other normal versions get a 2 year. Even in this case, if a particular security vulnerability arises your Ubuntu version will get an update for it. Keep in mind that, the older your Ubuntu version is, the less updates it will get. It will still get them, but they could come all in one big hunk of patches on the same day or small amounts every so often. This is one reason to update to a new release. You will get, not only the updates and changes on the new release but you will be assured that you will have support for new technology in the hardware and software parts of the computer world.\nAfter the support time has ended, you are encourage to update since this is a normal behaviour on the software and hardware world. New stuff comes out to speed things up and make them easier, so we should take that into account. Just imagine, for example in my case, a world stuck with HTML 1.0 without Ajax, JQuery, Javascript and the likes. No HTML5 either. Same for hardware. No multi processing architectures, no AMD64, no Dual Channel memory and no Gigalan drivers. BTW, No Wifi or facebook either. The worst thing is... No askubuntu!!\n3. Should users update from not support versions (Very old versions) and how?\nYes they should. The only exception is, if you live in a very remote, away from civilization, no penguins allowed place. But you should update to keep your system current and up-to-date. In the case of not support versions, what most people will tell you is to backup your files and do a clean installation. This helps solve any issues you might find while doing an upgrade from one version to the next and also the amount of information that you would need to download. \nIs not the same to update from 9.10 to 10.04, 10.04 to 10.10, 10.10 to 11.04, 11.04 to 11.10, 11.10 to 12.04 and finally to 12.10 than to simply download the 12.10, backup your important files and do a clean install, then restore your backup files. Saves you time, bandwidth and you can start \"working\" sooner. The good news is that since a couple of version ago, new version of Ubuntu include in the LiveCD/LiveUSB an option in the installer to upgrade an existing older version of Ubuntu on the computer. So if you insert a LiveCD of 12.10 for example, and it detects an older version of Ubuntu, it will give you the option to upgrade it. Saving you tons of time and bandwidth along the way.\nOf course if you are trying to upgrade from an EOL release to a newer version and the next version is also EOL (For example trying to upgrade from 6.04 to 6.10 where both are EOL) doing the normal procedure like using do-release-upgrade -d or apt-get upgrade will not work because they will look for the next version and since it is also EOL will throw an error. More information about this in How to install software or upgrade from an old unsupported release?\nIn those cases I also urge the user to download the latest and either upgrade from the liveCD or reinstall from scratch after doing a proper backup.\nThere is even a page dedicated to EOL (End of Life) releases: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/EOLUpgrades/\n4. How does Ubuntu´s \"life-cycle\" differ from Windows?\nI will compare the Windows XP to Windows 7 life cycle or release cycle to the Ubuntu one. I am skipping Windows Vista because, well, we all know what happen to it. Hasta la Vista, baby!. \nAnyway, in the time frame between Windows XP and Windows 7, Ubuntu came out and then released 9 new versions of Ubuntu that each incorporated new technology to it, new software updates and techniques and new ideas from the community and devs. Read carefully, 9!. Before Windows 7 came out, did you know Ubuntu supported USB 3.0. Windows 7 did not support USB 3.0 when it came out. This gives you a direct idea of how, not only Ubuntu but software development in the open source world moves. It does not walk but runs. After the release of Windows 7 and before Windows 8 came out, Ubuntu had release versions 11.04, 11.10, 12.04 and 12.10 all of them incorporating new hardware/software.\nThis is all thanks to the direct link between all the points mentioned above and the time frame for development. The hardware and software worlds are moving very fast and for a Operating system to work in it, it has to develop and adapt according to this speed. This is a big benefit and attribute that benefits Ubuntu when compared to Windows. Although Windows has Service packs, they do not offer not even 10% of what happens in the time they release it and the time that version of Windows came out (2 years from the release of Windows 7 up until the SP1 for it just to give you an idea. That is about 4 versions of Ubuntu or 12 versions of the Linux kernel.).\nSo this way, you can see the benefits of a 6 months cycle versus a 2 year or 5/7 year one. Adds quicker support for hardware so the end user enjoys it. Adds new software techniques to it for less cpu/memory usage and it can be optimized quickly so the end user does not have to wait years for an official fix to appear.\nOverall, I think you can see each question answered in a way that helps you know the WHY, WHEN and HOW Ubuntu only supports versions for a limited time. I wanted to add one more question that many users asks and many times confuse:\n5 What is the difference in stability between LTS and Normal releases\nIf we are to talk about stability between both versions, then the answer is: The same. They both have the same stability because one of the main objectives to every Ubuntu version has always been Stability. If you install a LTS or a Normal release you will get the same stability. The actual difference between LTS and a normal release is what the LTS implies: Long Term Support. Which simply means, you will get updates for a longer amount time compared to a normal release. You will not get an enhanced performance, better graphics, more speed or anything else when comparing a LTS to a Normal release. This is not what a LTS offers in comparison. \nFor more information about the Differences between LTS and a Normal release (Which is also Stable) please see What's the difference between a Long Term Support Release and a Normal Release?\n\nA: A short, simple answer for those who don't need much technical language:\nA software company has to strike a balance between supporting old versions of the software, and focusing on developing the next version.\n\n\n*\n\n*Typically they will commit to support only a certain number of recent\nversions at a time.\n\n*Many companies will state in advance how long a particular version will be supported for.\n\n\n*\n\n*Knowing this in advance allows big companies to better plan their upgrade schedule.\n\n*Canonical (founders of Ubuntu) are not the only ones that do this.  Microsoft set schedules saying how long they will support each version of Windows, too.  It's common for makers of software that needs to be used by big companies (or \"enterprises\") for whom upgrading is no small task.\n\n\n*\"Support\" could mean providing updates for bugs or security flaws, and/or providing technical support and assistance using or installing the software.\n\n*As a piece of software gets more out of date, it becomes more and more different from the latest version.\n\n\n*\n\n*This creates more work for developers providing bug fixes for those versions, and for support staff to be knowledgeable about those versions. \n\n*There comes a time when the low number of people using an older version, its obsolescence, or the number of more recent versions also requiring support, no longer justifies continuing to support it.\n\n\n*Sometimes, particular versions are designated as having a longer support lifetime than others.\n\n\n*\n\n*In Ubuntu these versions are labelled \"LTS\" for \"Long Term Support\".\n\n*These versions are particularly attractive to big companies for whom upgrading is no small task.\n", "Q: How do I get a RoseWill rk-8100 keyboard working?

With the proper adaptor or natively on sd card embedded laptops. This is how I am writting this: Installed in a 16GB SDCard with 10.5GB Free.\nAnyway I suggest you to disconnect all your hard disk drives in your computer, specially those which are having a OS installed (Windows, Linux, etc.) as you may finish having a multi-boot USB/SD Memory with GRUB and in certain cases the bootloader can be written in a different device, other than the USB Memory/SD Card.\nGood luck!\n\nA: Yes, the Startup Disk Creator that comes pre-installed in ubuntu (usb-creator-gtk) allows a persistent option while creating a live-usb install.\n\nIncrease the space to whatever you find reasonable. Persistence gives you the freedom to save changes, in the form of settings or files etc, during the live session and the changes are available the next time you boot via the usb drive.\nusb-creator limits your live persistent partition size to 4gb, though. To bypass that limit, you would need to edit the partition, and re-size it using a partition editor (such as gparted).\nSee Live Usb Persistent on the ubuntu wiki for more information.\n", "Q: Title bar is missing after closing wine I'm using wine only for chessbase 9, and after I close the program, every windows' titlebars are missing.\nIf i type \"unity --replace\" or \"unity --reset\" in terminal, the title bars get back, but every time I use wine, they gone.

BTW on laptop is (if it will turn on) too.\nHow can i get it?\n\nA: Try adjusting it with the xrandr command.\nFirst find your device name by entering:\nxrandr\n\nThere's an output line like:\nLVDS connected 1440x900+0+0 (normal left inverted right x axis y axis) 367mm x 230mm\n\nYou'll have to determine which choice is your external monitor.\nThe enter a command like (substituting for your device LVDS):\nxrandr --output LVDS --prop --verbose --gamma 1.0:1.0:1.5\n\nexperiment with value, until you like the results. The numbesr must be floating point and they stand for red:green:blue.\nThe driver shouldn't matter.\nSee this man page.\n\nA: If you have more than one screen, you have to select the one you want xgamma to target. Check your screens with echo $DISPLAY. The result for my single screen is :0.0. So if I wanted to target my screen I would use :0.0 (even though with one screen it is unnecessary), and thus enter the following: xgamma -display :0.0 -gamma 1.2. \nSo with this information in mind, turn off your laptop screen, simply find what display number your external screen is using with echo $DISPLAY , and include that in the xgamma command that I have given above.\nIf that does not solve it, and if you are running proprietary drivers from Nvidia or AMD, you may need to look at the settings and options of those devices rather than xgamma.\n", "Q: Is 32 bit Ubuntu installation necessary to install 64 bit Ubuntu? I'm going to install Ubuntu 12.04 Precise Pangolin(x64)  and this article  says it requires clean install from 32 bit. Does it mean -- forgive me, I'm Turk and my English is not perfect -- \"First install 32 bit and then install 64 bit onto it?\"\n\nA: No.\nThey are simply stating that you cannot upgrade an existing 32-bit Ubuntu installation to a newer, 64-bit version without first erasing the previous Ubuntu installation. \nYou may install a fresh copy of the 64-bit version of Ubuntu exactly as you would install the 32-bit version.\n\nA: Simply - No. Just run the installation and install 64 bit version.\nOne of the cons you are referencing to, Requires clean install from 32bit, means that if you want to upgrade from 32 bit version to 64 one, this will not work - you'll need to make a clean install.\n\nA: \nBy \"requires clean install from 32-bit\" (under \"64bit Cons\") that page is trying to convey exactly the opposite of your assumption. It means that if you start with a 32-bit system, you cannot \"upgrade\" it to be 64-bit. Instead, you have to start fresh with a \"clean\" 64-bit installation.\n\nYou do not need to start with a 32-bit installation to get a 64-bit installation.\nIn fact, you really can't convert a 32-bit installation into a 64-bit installation. \"Cross-grading\" is unsupported and all existing methods for attempting it are likely to leave you with a poorly functioning system that contains some 64-bit and some 32-bit components.\nIf you want to install the 64-bit version of Ubuntu, just install that. Having the 32-bit version installed first will only complicate things, as you'd have to remove it or install over it.\n", "Q: How to select or deselect radio button in python / glade As in topic, how can I select or deselect radio buttons in python.\nThe application is made by quickly.\nany help pleas ? \n\nA: Like checkboxes, radio buttons also inherit from Gtk.ToggleButton, so you can use the set_active() method to set the status of a radio button. This action causes the “toggled” signal to be emitted.  \nFor example, if we have 3 radio buttons called radio1, radio2, and radio3 in a group, by default the first one in the group would be selected.

For months it would regularly crash Unity, so consider yourself lucky if it doesn't crash.\nYou had to have taken some action in order to install fglrx; it doesn't come installed by default.

I wasn't able to connect to it, so I used the following commands in this exact order.\n\n\n*\n\n*start squid, the response: squid start/running, process 8988\n\n*status squid, the response: squid stop/waiting\n\n*stop squid or restart squid, the response: stop: Unknown instance:\nI'm not sure what I could do to get it to run, but everything I have tried in the forums has led me nowhere.\n\nA: Clearing Up Conceptual Misunderstandings In Your Question\nSquid isn't \"anonymous\"; you have to tweak the settings a lot to get it to stop advertising your host IP. There's actually an Internet standard called RFC 2616 which requires that proxies provide an HTTP header called Via: (Page 145 of RFC 2616 document). I quote:\n\nThe Via general-header field MUST be used by gateways and proxies to\n     indicate the intermediate protocols and recipients between the user\n     agent and the server on requests, and between the origin server and\n     the client on responses.\n\nIn other words, the HTTP/1.1 Internet standard protocol says that proxies are required to tell the server the IP address of the proxied host. So if you're going to respect the HTTP protocol, your proxy cannot be anonymous.\nHowever, Squid does allow you to violate the HTTP standard, for whatever purpose that may serve (in general it can only serve to hurt the Internet, because breaking standards is the first step towards incompatibility...). There are configuration settings within Squid that you can change in order to hide your local system's IP, so that Squid will not \"tell on you\" to the remote server. I can't recommend you do this any more than the Internet Engineering Task Force can recommend it, because it would violate the standard. So I suggest you google for \"Squid disable via header\".\nAlso, as a point of fact: even if you manage to get squid to hide your host IP, servers that you connect to are still going to see the immediate IP of the server that is running Squid on it. So if your home network connection has IP address 1.2.3.4 (for example), and you convince Squid not to show your 1.2.3.4 IP to the internet, then the internet will still see the IP address of your server, which may be 5.6.7.8. And from the IP address of your server, they can eventually tell the hosting company you're using, and from that, they can file abuse reports, and possibly get your name using a WHOIS record, etc. \nIf you are interested in true anonymity while surfing the Internet, I recommend you take a look at Tor instead. Tor actually changes your \"perceived\" IP address on the public internet very frequently, by using a large network of servers, so that your true identity is very difficult to track. \nThe only drawbacks of Tor are:\n(1) It's slow;\n(2) Many websites that require authentication (https://) will throw all kinds of errors if you try to use Tor, because your IP address keeps changing, which triggers security mechanisms... they think that someone is stealing your session cookies and hacking into your account. Which is basically true if you take the design of Tor literally, haha.\nHelping You Start Squid\nSquid is probably failing to start because it's missing some vital configuration information. Can you check out the .log files in the /var/log/squid/ directory? Posting them in their entirety here is discouraged if they're longer than a few lines, but you can post them to a PasteBin and provide the link to the paste.\nAlso, refer to this Ubuntu Wiki page for general information about Ubuntu's integration of Squid.\n", "Q: Eclipse menu colors I have just installed Ubuntu 12.04 and I have made no modification to it.\nI have installed Eclipse Juno. When I press Ctrl+O, the outline appears. However it appears as white letters over a black background. I doubt Eclipse would have made this by default, it's ugly and hard to read. It most likely takes a configuration from the OS.\nHow to change that to the usual black over white?\nps: Sorry for briefly putting the first answer as my accepted answer. I thought it could solve the problem, but after trying, it actually doesn't. Can I get more help on that please ?\n\nA: Eclipse uses the Standard Widget Toolkit (SWT) library for its rendering.\nSWT supports a number of \"backends\", which means that it passes its rendering requests to some other native library.\nIn the case of Ubuntu, it uses GTK2 as its backend.\nSo when Eclipse requests SWT to do some graphics operation, SWT asks GTK2 to do it.\nBut sometimes SWT and GTK2 don't play together nicely, and SWT can misunderstand the style information of GTK2. You see, Eclipse uses some widget designs (like that \"cool bar\" with the curve) that are not standard GTK2 widgets. And the widget customizations are implemented within SWT itself, not within GTK2. So SWT tries to \"guess\" what appropriate color type from GTK2 would be the most appropriate.\nSince Ubuntu's theme is very non standard among GTK2 themes, it appears that SWT guesses wrong about the intended colors.\nI would suggest looking through Ubuntu Software Center for some other GTK2 engines and/or themes, such as murrine or clearlooks, and install them. Then, you can use gnome-tweak-tool, or manually select your GTK2 theme by creating a symlink from /usr/share/themes/<whatever-theme>/gtk-2.0/gtkrc to ~/.gtkrc-2.0. This should, hopefully, make SWT pick up on the new GTK2 theme when it renders Eclipse, and you should at least get interesting results ;)\nSince Eclipse Juno isn't in the Ubuntu official repositories (or is it?!? you tell me!) I don't think this can be considered a proper Ubuntu bug, but you're welcome to file a defect in Launchpad against the Eclipse package if the built-in Ubuntu packages of Eclipse exhibit the same behavior.

When I try to start my Hadoop service, it complains that JAVA_HOME is not set.  \nIs there something that needs to be done to get JAVA_HOME set for all users?  \n\nA: Installing the packages typically sets up symlinks to the common Java binaries as /usr/bin/java, etc. and that's sufficient for most Java applications. \nSome still want the legacy JAVA_HOME and for something like Hadoop, the best place to set it is in the global environment config file /etc/environment ; it will then be available in the console (TTY), terminals and the desktop. \n", "Q: Will I be able to install Ubuntu on Windows 8 Laptops/Ultrabooks?

I've grown quite weary of shift-pgup to page up in gnome terminal, the command line, terminator, and guake, etc.\nAny way to easily make these apps use the straight page-up and page-down keys for paging around?\n\nA: Konsole is a terminal emulator for KDE that provides relevant option, in which can be configured to use Page Up and Page Down keys for direct paging. There are no other terminal emulators that I found as easy as Konsole for such customization.\nHow to direct paging\nIn Konsole, do the following steps.\n\n\n*\n\n*In menu bar, go to \"Settings\" and click \"Configure Current Profile...\" (Kubuntu 12.04) or \"Edit Current Profile...\" (Kubuntu 16.04) and a window will appear.\n\n*Click on \"Input\" tab (Kubuntu 12.04) or \"Keyboard\" tab (Kubuntu 16.04), which has a section called \"Key Bindings\" with predefined lists of key bindings.\n\n\n*Select \"Default (XFree 4)\" and click \"Edit...\" button, then another window will appear.\n\n*Scroll down and look for key combination PgDown-Shift-AnyModifier with output \\E[6~. Rename this output to ScrollPageDown.\n\n*Scroll down and look for key combination PgUp-Shift-AnyModifier with output \\E[5~. Rename this output to ScrollPageUp.\n\n*Click \"OK\" button to finish and close the windows.\nHow to test output\nIn step 3, there is \"Test Area\" to confirm the output for each key press.\n\n\n*\n\n*Click to bring focus in \"Input:\" text field and press Page Up and Page Down keys (one at a time).\n\n*Confirm the output to be the same as renamed ones.\n\nOr, write a simple script to echo message in loop. I have included my own script as following.\n\n\n*\n\n*Copy and paste the following lines of code in text editor.\n#!/bin/bash\n\necho \"Started script\"\necho \"If no input, then loop\"\nwhile true\ndo {\n    echo \"Hello, world\"\n    echo \"Wait 1 second to loop [q to quit]\"\n    read -t 1 -n 1 INPUT && echo\n    if [ \"$INPUT\" == \"q\" ]\n        then break\n        else echo \"UTC now: $(date -u +%H%M%S)\"\n    fi\n    continue\n}\ndone\necho \"Ended script\"\n\n\n*Save as file i.e. loop.sh and run the script in terminal i.e. bash loop.sh (non-executable).\n\n*Wait until the echoed messages fill the viewing area and started to scroll output downwards.\n\n*Then, press Page Up and Page Down keys to scroll up and scroll down the viewing area.\nI have tested using Konsole 2.8.5, KDE 4.8.5 in Kubuntu 12.04.\nBonus: Key combination and output\nAlright, bonus answer for clarification. One may wonder why I had to edit those key combination and not others. I had figured that out earlier by testing several types of keyboard.\nThe following are default key combination and its output, which have been figured out using \"Test Area\" in Konsole.\nFor primary Page Up/Page Down keys (including keyboard variant that requires to press Fn key a.k.a. Fn+PgUp/Fn+PgDn):\n\n\n*\n\n*Key combination: PgDown-Shift-AnyModifier  Output: \\E[6~\n\n*Key combination: PgUp-Shift-AnyModifier  Output: \\E[5~\nFor secondary Page Up/Page Down keys (default shortcut in terminal that requires Shift key a.k.a. Shift+PgUp/Shift+PgDn):\n\n\n*\n\n*Key combination: PgDown+Shift-AppScreen  Output: ScrollPageDown\n\n*Key combination: PgUp+Shift-AppScreen  Output: ScrollPageUp\nNotice that minus - and plus + signs differ between each keywords for primary and secondary keys. Those are how key presses are translated into equivalent characters, at least in Konsole.\nHowever, I'm unsure if those equivalent characters are actually understood by other terminal emulators. This is as far as I know by own experience.\nVerdict\nFor power users who don't like dealing with various configuration files and such tedious workarounds, Konsole will easily win your heart. It seems that nobody had noticed to this level of customization offered by Konsole and KDE for the past four years. How strange.\n\nA: I am afraid this is not possible, as no PgUp/PgDown will be sent to command-line applications, which will render some of them unusable. This is a good old days Unix feature.\nIf you want more user-friendly scrolling, I suggest using the less command. It's used this way:\ncommand-with-lot-of-output | less\n\nThis will start the less command with output of your original command. (*More about piping output to other programs can be found here.\nless can be navigated using arrows or PgUp/PgDown. For your convenience it also provides searching and more (see man less for more). You can quit less by pressing the q key.\n\nA: Use xterm and tweak the keybindings (in ~/.Xresources) like this:\nxterm*VT100.Translations: #override \\n\\\n    <KeyPress>Prior:scroll-back(1,page)\\n\\\n    <KeyPress>Next:scroll-forw(1,page)\\n\\\n\ngnome-terminal says PageUp/PageDown is for applications\nwithin the terminal and using them would be confusing...\n\nA: You can use the more command like this:\ncommand-with-lots-of-output  |  more\n\nthis will start your command original output with more.\nmore can be navigated with 'space'. Just press the space and see the output of the command as  pages.\n", "Q: Unity logs out after logging back in from suspend I'm having an issue.

So by the end of the year, I will buy an ultrabook to replace my heavy laptop which I have to carry almost everyday. I sure hope that Microsoft doesn't lock Linux users out with their secure-boot on x86 devices. Anyway, when I started using Ubuntu, I didn't understand a lot about Linux, but it was strange for me to see so many people complaining on the Internet about issues with drivers, graphic cards, overheating while using Ubuntu. I never had such problems, ever since I installed Ubuntu (started on 11.04), it always adapted just fine on my Toshiba Laptop.\nThen I realized that Ubuntu works great out of the box on my laptop because I have Intel dual-core and onboard graphics, which means I have a system that has no proprietary drivers, Intel drivers are not closed. I understood that it is very important to pick carefully the manufacturers in order to have a great experience with Ubuntu and avoid some headaches with incompatibilities (as NVIDIA for example).\nSo, besides Intel, which other hardware manufacters are more friendly to Linux (Ubuntu in particular)?\n\nA: As you mentioned, Intel is great with open-source drivers:\n\n\n*\n\n*For their integrated graphics\n\n*And for the other most common source of Linux driver hell, internal wireless adapters\n\n*\n\n*I would be sure to get a laptop (upgrade the configuration if necessary) to get one of the Intel Centrino adapters -- either the 1000-series, or somewhat higher-end 6000-series is OK.\n\n\n\nThe other aspect is the entire system, especially dual-graphics, which aren't well supported in Linux for either AMD or Nvidia (and you will have to get one of them if you want discrete graphics). For that, I'd recommend you consider getting a Lenovo Thinkpad, preferably the T, X or W series (which have their heritage in IBM). They have excellent Linux compatibility, and their BIOS includes dual-graphics options many laptops do not which give you some degree of control over when the discrete card (and hence more battery!) is used. Thinkpads also have an excellent user support community for Linux hardware here.\n\nA: The other source of Linux driver hell not mentioned above is printers. Some manufacturers are great, some don't even bother.\nIn the 'great' category I would put HP and Brother. HP created a lot of the software and standards for Linux printer drivers and protocols, so you would expect them to be good.\nIronically, in view of the comments above concerning laptops, Lenovo are useless when it comes to printers. I bought one once, and got it home before I discovered there were no Linux drivers for it, period. I had to take it back to the shop, and I ended up exchanging it for an HP.\nSo, it's worth checking driver availability for a printer before you part with the readies.\n\nA: You should check Partners at Ubuntu website.\nIt provides extensive info regarding:\n\n\n*\n\n*Certified hardware\n\n*Canonical partners\n\n*Certified software\n\n\n\nCanonical partners help to ensure that Ubuntu will always be\n  compatible with the latest hardware and software. And they provide a\n  range of services from implementation support to specialist tools.\nSource\n\n\nA: You might consider buying a laptop from a dedicated Linux distributor such as ZaReason or System76.  \nNot only will you get hardware that you can be sure will work well with Linux, but you will also have the benefit of professional support that understands Linux. \nInstead of contacting a support hotline that will put you on hold for an hour and then tell you to reboot & reinstall windows, you can speak immediately to a Linux expert who understands the hardware on your system and can help you troubleshoot your hardware, advise you about peripherals that will work well with that hardware, etc.  Besides, it's probably good to support these little guys, particularly as the big manufacturers move towards locking down boot loaders, etc.  \n", "Q: All drivers disabled after reinstallation I've been running Ubuntu 12.04 for quite a while, but after installing Windows XP onto another partition, the MBR was overwritten, etc etc.  \nI downgraded 12.04 to 11.10 using a Live CD, but it still didn't work. Used boot-repair then reinstalled 11.10, and I got GRUB back. Yes!\nSo, I booted Ubuntu, and found that I had no control over anything except the keyboard. The touchpad, USB mouse, disk drive, USB anything, wireless card, all gone. This naturally means that I can't get anything onto the hard drive without lots of shenanigans using the Live CD.  I've got a Gateway W340UI.  \nEager to get 12.04 back.\n\nA: Press Ctrl+Alt+T to open Terminal.\nRun lsmod to check your drivers one by one.\nMy other recommendation is to re-install your Ubuntu system. (Or if your network works fine via Ethernet, then you can try to upgrade to newer kernel versions, either now or after reinstalling.) \n\nA: I solved this problem by booting to an older kernel (3.0.0.23), which recognized my drivers, and then installing Ubuntu 12.04 from there.  Thanks for everyone's help.\n", "Q: Fullscreen youtube videos lagging a lot In my PC, I can watch youtube videos without any problem. However, they lag so much on fullscreen, that it's basically impossible to watch them.

I just disabled the built in Flash in Chrome and voilla. No lag anymore in full screen.\nHope it helps someone.\n\nA: You should check your about:gpu section in Chrome/ium. In older PC's HW Acceleration is disabled by default and you only can enable it by overriding the settings in the about:flags.\n\n\n*\n\n*Open the about:flags in your address bar\n\n*Look for Override software redendering list\n\n*Click \"Enable\"\n\n*Restart Chrome/ium\n\n\nA: This happens to me as well, specially on my older PC, if I watch a youtube video in fullscreen, it lags. What I usually do is to stretch the screen, but not to fullsize or I play it on VLC Player, where it does not lag anymore in full-screen.\nTo play a Youtube video on VLC Player, copy the address (if you are using secure \"https\" connection, remove the \"s\", make sure the link is http://www.youtube.com/watch). Then go to File -> Open Network Stream and paste in the main YouTube URL for a video.\nUnfortunatelly this only works with youtube videos for me, Vimeo videos don't play on VLC.\n\nA: I have solved using youtube HTML5 video player.\nYou can enable HTML5 video player using the following page:\nhttp://www.youtube.com/html5\nNow videos are fast and the laf was gone. I have tested it on Chrome.\n\nA: Tried turning down the resolution on the player? Normally, it will automatically up it when you go to fullscreen.  \nOther than that non-fix, all I can do is feel with you.

wrong?\nACTIONPARSNIP(ANDREW-WOODHEAD666) suggested this:\n\nTry changing:   #include <iostream>\nTo:   #include \"iostream\"\nOr try:   #include <iostream.h>\nor:   #include \"iostream.h\"\n\nAnd after doing these changes, I got the following.\nHere is the output for the same program above, with \"iostream.h\" instead of <iostream.h>:\n2.cpp:2:21: error: iostream.h: No such file or directory\n2.cpp: In function ‘int main()’:\n2.cpp:8: error: ‘cout’ was not declared in this scope\n2.cpp:8: error: ‘endl’ was not declared in this scope\n2.cpp:9: error: ‘cin’ was not declared in this scope\n\nCan anyone please help in this and suggest me whats wrong?\n\nA: #include <iostream> was correct. (Actually, you had #include<iostream>, without a space, but that is correct too.) Including \"iostream.h\" or <iostream.h> instead are actually both wrong, though some compilers and standard libraries will accept them.\nThis problem is because the standard library doesn't provide an overload of operator>> that can take an std::istream on the left and an std::ostream& on the right. To put it more plainly, this is where your error is happening:\ncin >> ch>>endl;\n\n\n\n*\n\n*Please note that this is equivalent to (cin >> ch) >> endl, and it's the >> outside the parentheses where the error is happening, though changing the parentheses to try to pass ch and endl as arguments to >> would also be wrong.\n\n*endl is an ostream& and cin is an istream. >> cannot operate with an istream on the left and an ostream& on the right, as the STL doesn't define any overload that can be selected for such an expression.\n\n\nYou can use endl with cout, but you cannot use it like this with cin.\nHow to fix this depends on what you intended to do.\n\n\n*\n\n*If your goal is to print a newline after taking input, add a separate statement (cout << endl) after this, or add endl to the subsequent statement with cout that you already have.\n\n*If your goal is to stop taking input when a newline is encountered, that will already happen using << with cin, so just remove the endl part altogether:\ncin >> ch;\n\n\n*If your goal is to keep taking input when any whitespace except a newline is encountered (that is, you want to make sure to read exactly one line of input into a char array orstd::string), you will have to use a more complex expression, or perhaps not even use operator>> with cin at all.\nSince it's not clear that is what you want, and solutions for doing that are not platform specific (whereas what overloads are available in an STL implementation is at least theoretically platform-specific), details about how to do that are beyond the scope of this answer. But if that's what you want to do, I recommend asking on Stack Overflow.\n\nA: You should use:#include <iostream> (don't forget about space) and using namespace std;\nCompile it by following this syntax: g++ -o 2 2.cpp\nIf this doesn't work then: find /usr/include -name iostream -type f -print and add it to your include path\n", "Q: What do the Ubuntu Webapps Technology offer I started hearing about the webapp technologies a couple of days ago and from what I have heard they look good.

Is there a way to fix this error without using a LiveCD?\nI have an installer of Ubuntu on a flash drive will that one work since I don't have a DVD ROM available?\n\nA: You can install GRUB on your hard disk. You can do this by using putting the LiveCD on a flash disk ( How can I make a Ubuntu Live USB with Ubuntu, GParted & HBCD? )\n\n\n*\n\n*Boot to the Flash Disk.

You must use a LiveCD to install a bootloader - either GRUB, or use the Windows CD to reinstall the Windows bootloader. I suggest LILO (Linux Loader), but like the fellow who suggested syslinux, I am not sure how to install it.

Photos are set to Auto-Upload which works fine - I see the photos on my windows machines as expected.\nHowever, when I delete a photo from that folder using my Windows machine Ubuntu One Files does not remove the corresponding file from the Android phone.\nDoes the Android App not support two-way sync? Or have I overlooked something?\nThanks.\n\nA: The Ubuntu One files app for Android does not do two way sync. Currently only photos are auto-uploaded. There are plans to support fuller sync functionality in the app with future updates. Announcements about this will be made on the Ubuntu One blog at http://voices.canonical.com/ubuntuone\n\nA: From reading other posts I have found the answer I am looking for: \nUbuntu One has an option to Auto-Upload Photos from Android phones to a specified folder on Ubuntu One. This feature works fine - on my phone sdcard\\dcim\\100MEDIA replicates to Folder1 on Ubuntu One. When I delete a file from another device from Folder1 it does infact delete the file from all other instances of Ubuntu One.\nThe catch is that Folder1 is not linked in anyway to sdcard\\dcim\\100MEDIA. The Ubuntu One folder on Android is located at sdcard\\u1\\Folder1. Deleting a file in one location doesn't impact the copy in the other folder.\nUbuntu One Files App for android is only good for viewing your content (and auto-uploading photographs)\nA little off topic to my questions but maybe useful to someone - according to this post dated April 30th: http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=1940338 content put in sdcard\\u1\\Folder1 will not be sent to Ubuntu One. Confirms what Joshua Hoover says.\nUntil Ubuntu One Files supports two-way sync natively your best bet is Folder Sync Lite http://market.android.com/search?q=pname:dk.tacit.android.foldersync.lite - I installed this app, setup ubuntu one access (it also supports several other cloud storage providers) and set it up to do a two-way sync (with option to sync deletions) and it works like a champ. To avoid any confusion I disabled auto-upload of photos through Ubuntu One Files.\n", "Q: Why is one keyboard controlling both seats in my multiseat config? Ubuntu 12.04 32-bit, stock install with minimal additional software\nI'm trying to get a multiseat X setup going... two separate keyboard/mouse/monitor sets on one PC. I used this document for guidance, and though I had to install KDM and a bunch of other KDE stuff (tried to accomplish this with lightdm but didn't get anywhere), I'm so close to getting this working.\nThe monitors and the mice are working correctly, which is to say I get two separate X login screens, and each mouse works a different screen.

I've experienced this problem every time (3 times now) I install Precise and run a dist-upgrade: when booting up, I get thrown a gfxmode error, followed by either a long blank screen with a single blinking cursor (with splash on), before showing the plymouth splash for all of a split second.\nI use the workaround for the gfxmode error, but I still end up with a weird-looking boot up because of the splash not showing until the very end. My main concern though is why this sort of thing occurs in the first place, and what might be happening during the update process to be causing this. (And I'm pretty sure it's something that was caused by updating; the boot process was fine until I did an upgrade).\n\nA: I'm not sure about why the gfxmode is happening(a quick search on askubuntu only game me ways to fix it not a root cause) but is is unrelated to the missing boot screen.\nThe \"missing\" boot screen is normal behavior in 12.04 in my experience, but the link that I provide dates back to Jan 2011.(may have more to do with how fast your processor is, I only noticed this with my new computer, an Intel Sandy Bridge, which I bought to install 12.04 on, my old computer was 6yrs old and alot slower) \npaste from The Linux Experience\n\nWHY DOESN'T IT WORK?!\nPlymouth is a very young piece of technology and it is still not as\n  solid as one would desire. One of the most frequent problems is the\n  one I described above, where you get a black screen with a blinking\n  cursor instead of your shiny Plymouth splash screen.\nEssentially, the root cause of this problem relates to graphics\n  drivers loading slowly, too slowly for the system to wait for them.\n  The file system is checked and loaded in a shorter time, thus allowing\n  X to load, perhaps making it unreasonable to have to wait for those\n  graphics drivers to load.\n\nIf you want to read more about it the link has a goodly bit of information about it. If you just want to get your screen back I will copy the directions form the site(I used these commands myself, I hated looking at the blank screen)\n\n\n*\n\n*Open a virtual terminal and type the following command:\nsudo gedit /etc/initramfs-tools/conf.d/splash\nThis file may not exist, so you may be creating it from scratch now. \n\n*Enter the following content on the file you opened on the previous step:\nFRAMEBUFFER=y\n\n*Close and save the file.\n\n*Now, run the following command to commit the change:\nsudo update-initramfs -u\nAfter rebooting you will have the splash screen back,also you will be able to see any text when pressing Esc during the splash screen or remove quiet splash from the boot commands, without this fix even if you remove quiet splash, you will only see a blank screen until the log in screen(lightdm)\n", "Q: How does ubuntu live/install disc jack boot/BIOS?

For this reason, I almost always keep source code archives when building software from source.\n\n*Some applications that use archives might need the original archive itself (and a re-created archive, from its extracted contents, won't do). A re-created archive would be equivalent in terms of the files, directory structure, and ownership/permissions/attribute information it contains. But it might not be exactly the same file, so a re-created archive may not have the same same md5, sha256, or other hash, used to verify that it is safe to use and not corrupted.\nBut these are the exceptions rather than the rule. Usually, you can re-download the archive if you need it again, and can feel free to delete it.\n", "Q: Can anyone help with this font problem? \n(The above screenshot is of a drop-down menu, by the way.)\nSo, I've been having problems for the last while where some text (not all) is scrunched up like in the screenshot above. I've tried fiddling around with the font settings, resetting font settings to default, etc., but I haven't found anything that's worked. This happens in both Chromium and Firefox and it's really getting annoying. It makes things very hard to select, not to mention it just looks hideous.\nHas anyone else experienced this problem? Any ideas on how to fix it?\nIt happens whether I'm using Unity, Gnome Shell or KDE Plasma.\n\nA: It's been a while, so I'm not sure if anyone will see this but I've solved the problem.\nI figured it was something to do with the font itself, so I managed to find out what font it was. It was Helvetica. I removed the font from my system and now everything works fine again. :) Guess something was messed up with displaying that font on my system, for some reason. No idea why, but I'm glad it got solved!\n", "Q: I lost the boot partition, what should I do? Recently, I dualbooted windows 7 and Ubuntu 12.04, then I decided to be able to open the Windows 7 files from within Ubuntu. But I mounted the wrong partition and accidentally deleted it when I realized it was the wrong one... It's only when I restarted my computer that I realized that I deleted the boot partition.\nNow, whenever I try to open the PC, it says:\nBOOTMGR is missing\nPress Ctrl+Alt+Del to restart\nWhenever I try the above command, it eventually restarts and gets back to the same screen. Windows 7 was the main boot screen. I was planning on creating a Windows recovery disc, is it a great idea? Will it work? If not, have any other ideas?\n\nA: You have to fix two bootloaders:\n\n\n*\n\n*Windows 7 bootmgr and \n\n*GRUB for Ubuntu. \n\n\n\nFollowing are the steps to do so:\n\n\n*\n\n*Insert your Windows Vista or Windows 7 disk into your DVD player and restart your computer.\n\n*The next screen you see should have the Language, Time and Currency and Keyboard boxes.\n\n*In the lower left side there are two options: “What to know before installing Windows” and “Repair your computer.”\n\n*Click on “Repair your computer”.\n\n*Windows will then try to find the installation directory for Vista or Windows 7, depending on what you have.\n\n*Next up is a screen with a box called Recovery Options. Click the first option, Startup Repair.\n\n*You’ll see a Startup Repair box with the message “Startup Repair is checking your system for problems…”\n\n*When it’s done, it will prompt you to reboot. If there is more than one problem it may reboot again to continue repairing.\n\n*At this point, you can remove the DVD, reboot and everything should be working.\nNow you are done with Windows 7 Boot loader. Time to fix GRUB. Do the Following:\nYou can install GRUB on your hard disk. You can do this by using bootable Ubuntu CD.\nBoot to live cd. When you get UBUNTU Live Desktop. Open terminal and type the following\n\n\n*\n\n*sudo grub-install /dev/sda\n\n*sudo update-grub\n\n*quit\nYou are done now. Reboot the machine.\nThis will install grub on MBR of your hard disk with dual boot. Try the latest Ubuntu 12.04 LTS.\n\n\n\n*\n\n*https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Grub2/Installing#Fixing_a_Broken_System\nYou can also use the bootrepair tool to reinstall grub:\n\n\n*\n\n*https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Boot-Repair\n\nA: Check the following links to get help on recovering Windows 7 boot files\n\n\n*\n\n*http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_7-system/windows-7-ultimate-bootmgr-is-missing-ctrlaltdel/a5793c54-1912-445d-9703-8caeca32e6f9\n\n*http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_7-system/windows-7-bootmgr-is-missing-resolved-using-winre/8bb148bc-8035-4847-9696-888f7a0a9720\nAfter you successfully recovered Windows 7, you need to recover Grub to be able to boot to Ubuntu.

Replace it with the same form factor if you can find it. \nIntel Pro 4965AGN is old (about 2007 or so), and apparently, it had this problem on Linux for many years. It is unlikely that Intel will ever fix the driver for such an old piece of hardware, that it hasn't been able to fix thus far. I'd imagine this task is of a very low priority on the maintainers' to do list,if it's on the list at all. It is unfortunate, because Intel branded wireless cards used to have good Linux support, and were known to work out of the box.\n\nA: rfkill is a small tool to query the state of the rfkill switches, buttons and subsystem interfaces. \nMaybe try:\nrfkill unblock all\n\nI assume based on your question that you tried different modules versions and configurations if not please do it :)\nI hate to say that, blacklist iwl4965 module and try using ndiswrapper.\n", "Q: No internet connection using ethernet I installed Ubuntu 12.04 as an app in Windows 7.

Cinnamon's new update had some problems and it used to freeze a lot while I was working on my computer.   \nSo I read some solutions online, and they dictated me to downgrade the xserver-common package.

You can even create a virtual machine on your Windows desktop to export it to the server, run it there, and use your Windows for display of the VM. However you will need a cross-platform solution that will run on both Windows, and Ubuntu.\nIn case you want to try out Virtual Box you will need the closed source (PUEL) but free version available from Oracle (see this question on how to install for Ubuntu and the user manual for installation on Windows) to get support for the Virtual Box remote desktop display feature.\nThere is a nice tutorial from the Virtual Box user manual on how to set this up and how to run virtual box in \"headless\" mode on a server to use a remote machine's display via VRDP.\n", "Q: Wireless hard block on ASUS N61Jv (ar9285) I just did a fresh install of Ubuntu and noticed that my wifi is disabled.\nIn try menu it says that my hardware switch is disabled, but there is no physical switch on N61Jv.

How to configure iscsi fault tolerance in ubuntu 12.04?\niSCSI SANs usually have multiple controllers that make failover transparent to the clients.. what i am doing is the following. i made an ubuntu pc as target which means a pc to work as storage where i map its hdd as LUN also there is another pc which works as initiator so there is no ready solutions such as SAN im doing from scratch so i need to learn how to configure that.\n\nA: Could you please be more specific? iSCSI SANs usually have multiple controllers that make failover transparent to the clients, the SAN IP is simply attached to the remaining controller. Multipath is multipath, it's an OS independent concept, Linux multipath readily supports many iSCSI SANs.\nhttps://help.ubuntu.com/12.04/serverguide/device-mapper-multipathing.html\nUpdate 8/17/2012\nSo depending on how you defined the network you might have the capacity to create path redundancy, but the storage host itself is one big single point of failure. As long as you understand that you can create a custom solution. There are some roadblocks however.\nMultipath operates on the concept of interrogating the paths, identifying all the ones that respond with the same WWID, which is the result of running scsi_id, and then using that to group the correct paths under a single map, and enforce the grouping policy defined. Since these iscsi initiators are essentially virtual devices, they usually don't go so far as to define unique attributes for them. For example.\n\nroot@ubuntu02:/persistent/home/intel# sg_vpd -p di /dev/sda\nDevice Identification VPD page:\n  Addressed logical unit:\n    designator type: EUI-64 based,  code set: Binary\n      0x22f7000155affff4\n    designator type: vendor specific [0x0],  code set: ASCII\n      vendor specific: 0xC001IntelVD VMBOOT1\n  Target port:\n    designator type: Relative target port,  code set: Binary\n      Relative target port: 0x2\n    designator type: Target port group,  code set: Binary\n      Target port group: 0x0\n\n\nIs probably going to return nothing.

You could create a map directly using dmsetup, it would even failover, just not very efficient and you would have to manage the path membership yourself.\nhttp://christophe.varoqui.free.fr/refbook.html\nSee \"example of a multipath target\".\nAlternatively you could go with a network bonding solution, at least you'll have higher availability than you do now, but at the expense of performance.\n\nA: You can use a pre-configured tool called glusterfs.

Found that wine explorer would run, but some \"3rd party\" programs would not, in my case it was femm42, a finite element analysis program for magnetics. In this case, the missing dll was mfc90.dll, but this doesn't really matter. Just try to locate your particular missing dll on the internet and download it. Next, examine any particular dll within the wine/windows application to uncover its location. I found that the dll's showed up at four locations, not just under system32. After copying the missing file to all such locations and updating the Ubuntu database, femm42 worked. NOTE: I'm running 64 bit, which required the four locations. It appears that 32 bit systems may only require copying to two of these locations.\n", "Q: Analog stereo out on speakers and headphones this sounds like a pretty dumb question but how can I get audio output on headphones and speakers?  My motherboard is GA-G41M-Combo and doesn't seem to have any digital audio out, but 3 miniplugs coloured blue, green, and red.  I don't want surround, I just want headphones and speakers working at the same time without needing to switch a cable (my headphones have a power on/off toggle).  The motherboard looks like this:\n\nI currently have speakers plugged into green (working) and headphones plugged into blue (no sound), and can't seem to get output on the headphones after fiddling with the sound settings in Ubuntu 12.04.  Do I really have to buy a splitter?!  The motherboard didn't come with any front panel adapters.  \n\nA: I don't have a system which I can test this out on, but I believe this section from the Arch Linux PulseAudio website should help you:\nhttps://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/PulseAudio/Examples#Splitting_front.2Frear\nTo sum up what you should do:\n\n*\n\n*Open a terminal and make a back up of /etc/pulse/default.pa like this: cp /etc/pulse/default.pa ~/default.pa.bak\n\n*Open the sound settings menu and change \"analog output\"'s mode to \"Analog Surround 4.0 Output\"\n\n*In the terminal run pacmd list-sinks and copy the outputted sink's name. Mine looks like \"name: \", and we're interested in the bit in <>, yours should now end in \"analog-surround-40\".\n\n*Open default.pa as administrator using sudo gedit /etc/pulse/default.pa and add the lines:\n\nload-module module-remap-sink sink_name=speakers remix=no master=alsa_output.pci-0000_05_00.0.analog-surround-40 channels=2 master_channel_map=front-left,front-right channel_map=front-left,front-right\nload-module module-remap-sink sink_name=headphones remix=no master=alsa_output.pci-0000_05_00.0.analog-surround-40 channels=2 master_channel_map=rear-left,rear-right   channel_map=front-left,front-right\n  \n  Replace \"master=alsa_output.pci-0000_05_00.0.analog-surround-40\" with the device name you found in step 3.\n\nNow you should be able to select from \"Headphones\" and \"Speakers\" in the Sound Settings menu when you want to switch between headphones and speakers.\n", "Q: How to make Thunar show short file names?

You can install it with sudo apt-get install nautilus. \nAlternatively, You can request a feature in by going to XFCE forum to implement this or even you can help them by your coding skill, if you want.\nFor more information, see thunar faq or visit Official documentation for thunar.\n", "Q: Using 2 factor authentication syncing gmail contacts with evolution I have been trying to get an answer to a question but all I find are links to non related subjects or suggestions to try another method.

This particular file could be corrupt, and so won't open properly. If using tar to extract, you need to use the z option, as that's necessary when an archive is gzipped: tar xzvf <file.tar.gz>. Alternatively , it is also worth trying to extract it with gunzip <file.tar.gz> \nTo find out whether the file is corrupt, run gzip -t <file.tar.gz>; this command will check the file for errors, and if any are found they should appear in the terminal. This should tell you whether the file is corrupt.\nIf the file is sound and the error reoccurs, it means it is probably the known issue with tar that occurs when a file does not have a pair of zero blocks at the end of it, as GNU tar expects. The solution to this is to add the -i option to ignore the zero blocks. So use tar ixzvf <file.tar.gz> The issue is documented here in detail.\n\nA: The same thing has happened to me because I piped both stdout and stderr through a channel that doesn't separate stderr and stdout (an android adb terminal session).  \nThat way some error messages ended up in the stream. This was the faulty command:\n\n\n*\n\n*Faulty command, adb shell just merges stderr and stdout locally => garbage! :\nadb shell tar -cf - /some/dir \\| uuencode bla | uudecode  -o - > backup.tar\n\n*Fixed command:\nadb shell tar -cf - /some/dir 2>/dev/null\\| uuencode bla | uudecode  -o - > backup.tar\nThe same will happen if you do a similar command over SSH like this quick tar streaming over ssh if you forget to redirect stderr to /dev/null:\nssh user@host tar -czf /some/remote/path 2\\>/dev/null > /local/path/to/file.tar.gz\n\nA: I got this error the other day trying to untar an archive which was not gzipped. The source of the file was unknown to me but I figured that the creator might use cat to combine several tars into a single one. This caused the end-of-file zero marker to be read by tar utility in the middle of a combined archive thus displaying \"A lone zero block\" error.\nIf this is the case then --ignore-zeros or -i option might help to suppress these errors. Please see man tar or this link as a reference.\n", "Q: Will removing Windows also remove Wubi? \nPossible Duplicate:\nDoes Ubuntu rely on Windows if I install it using the Windows installer? \n\nI installed Ubuntu via Ubuntu Windows Installer 12.04, but now I want to remove Windows on my computer. Will Ubuntu be removed, If I remove windows?\nI also want to change storage size, because Ubuntu is really running slower than Windows 7.\n\nA: Firstly, if you installed Ubuntu on the same partition of Windows, you'll probably lose Ubuntu since you'll format that partition to remove Windows. Else if Ubuntu is installed to a different partition then probably nothing will happen. To change storage size you could use software to do that such as rescue disc, erd, etc.\n\nA: Best way would be to install a fresh copy of Ubuntu physically on different partition of same disk, leaving Windows 7 untouched if you want to use Windows 7 and Ubuntu as a dual boot.\nTo dual boot:\n\n\n*\n\n*Remove Ubuntu Wubi from Windows 7 using uninstaller within Windows 7 (in control center)\n\n*Reboot the machine once Wubi is removed from Windows 7\n\n*Install fresh copy using Ubuntu LiveCd\n\nA: Yes.\n\n\n*\n\n*If you installed Wubi (Ubuntu Windows Installer) on Drive C, it will be removed.\n\n*If you installed Wubi on another drive, the data will be there but you will no longer be able to boot it because removing Windows also removes its boot manager which is necessary to start Wubi.\n\n*The best option to address the \"slowness\" is to install Ubuntu via a Live-CD or Live-USB as a true dual-boot\n\n*You can convert your Wubi to a \"regular\" install with the MigrateWubi script (which has the blessings of the official Wubi Community Wiki). Note that you will need to run this from either a Live-CD/Live-USB OR another Linux installation.\n\n\nA: When you install Ubuntu via Wubi, it creates a very large file to hold all those Ubuntu stuff.  The whole file acts like a virtual disk.  It is based on Windows, so if you remove Windows, Ubuntu will also be removed.\nTo have only Ubuntu on your computer, you will have to have a full install (instead of Wubi) of ubuntu on your computer.\nYou can have 2 options: Remove Wubi and do a clean installation of Ubuntu or Migrate Wubi to another partition(which, in other words, upgrade a wubi install to a full Ubuntu installation).\nThe first one is quite simple.  Find \"Ubuntu\" in the \"Change or Modify Windows Programs\" panel in Windows.  Right-Click and select \"Remove\".  Then, install Ubuntu from a Ubuntu CD or DVD.  Note that all the stuff in Wubi will be deleted.\nIf you want to keep the settings and files in Wubi, you can migrate the Wubi install to another partition.  I personally don't recommend that, since a wrong step can render your computer unbootable.  Read the UbuntuForums guide or the Ubuntu Wiki Guide for the steps.  After that, you can remove Windows with How to remove Ubuntu and put Windows back on?\nAnd Wubi can be slower than a Full Ubuntu installation, because it is based on Windows instead of standing on it's own.\n\nA: IF you are re-installing windows, And you DO NOT select \"format disk\"\n-> Then no, wubi will not be deleted.\nWubi+Ubuntu is a big file on the C:\\ drive that pretends to be a hard drive. Reinstalling windows will only move USER files and C:\\windows to a \"windows.old\" folder.\nBut if you mean to delete the drive completely, no.\n Remember-> If it asks you to format, Say-> NO\"\nUnless that's what you want.\n", "Q: manage 2 wireless device I erased Windows 7 and installed Ubuntu 12.04 on my Dell Latitude E4200.\nI an very happy with my choice but with little pity.\nI cannot use the wireless service in my university as the build-in device works unstable.

Has SandForce driver.\n\n*Ubuntu 12.04 Desktop 32 bits.\n\n*One 18 GB partition for GNU/Linux and 1.5 GB for SWAP.\n\n*MD5 for the Ubuntu install CD is OK.\n\n\nI tried to install Ubuntu. It seems that everything is recognized, but there's a big problem: read and writes to the SSD are extremely slow. For example, the install process, which shouldn't take more than 20 minutes, it takes 7 hours. Then, booting up the computer takes about 20 minutes. I checked and the problem is definitely the SSD. Every access to any file is like 10 times slower than normal.\nI have tried to format the partition as Ext4 and Ext3 with the same problem.\nTrying to install other distros like Fedora 17, I have a similar problem. There's a \"lag\" with the SSD, but not so accused as in Ubuntu. Surprisingly, Debian 6.0 installs and works without any problem. Mac OS works pretty good as well in the other partition, so I discard it's an SSD problem.\nThanks for your help!\n\nA: There is an article on the Gentoo Wiki that describes an issue with a BIOS compatibility mode potentially slowing down SSD access.\n\nWhen MacBook uses BIOS compatibility mode, it switches the SATA controller to IDE mode, making hdd/ssd operations slower since kernel will use ata_piix module insetead of ahci. It seems there are couple of ways to change this, but this one I find to be the easiest, and actually it is the only that worked for me. I have tested this with MacBook Pro 6.2. \n\nIt doesn't sound like it's on the scale you're talking about, but still perhaps something to check.\n\nA: I might have had a very similar problem (MBP 7,1, SSD: OCZ Vertex 2). I checked my SSD performance using sudo hdparm -tT /dev/sda and sometimes (not reproducible) got values <1 MB/s (!). The installation (Ubuntu 12.04 32bit, 64bit) took very, very long and updating the system lasted forever. As OS X was very fast I thought it was something else than the SSD. So I tried ext3, ext4 - same behaviour.\nFinally I upgraded the SSDs firmware (which was pain in the *#~ as the OS X tools that OCZ provides do not run as they should) and that did the job!

I have downloaded the file from nvidias site and run it, but it just doesn't seem to help. I am still unable to increase the resolution, however after running this I am able to boot with the graphics card, without the driver from nvidia it just displays a purple screen when trying to boot. Does anyone know how I can get this card working properly?\nUPDATE: \nOk, so I have managed to install with nomodeset with the graphics card installed, however I am now having an issue with increasing the resolution, please see the below information:\npastebin.com/LrH2jm6c\npastebin.com/tscCiybw\nDoes anyone have any ideas why my resolution is restricted? \n\nA: After our small conversation in the comments it appears that your problem is you haven't even been able to try installing the included proprietary driver yet, because you can't even run the installer (or, if you do run the installer without the graphics card present, you then cannot boot once you replace the graphics card).\nHaving virtually the same card as you, I found that for whatever reason, the nouveau drivers supplied with Ubuntu 12.04 just don't seem to work with this card - and don't allow it to boot into X properly (even for the graphical installer).  Interestingly, the nouveau drivers included with Ubuntu 11.10 did work, so not sure what happened.\nFor the installer CD, there is an easy workaround - at the initial boot screen when the keyboard icon appears, press any key to get a menu, and find the menu option that allows you to boot with the nomodeset option.  Without modesetting enabled, nouveau won't load (which means you'll get ugly, slow graphics, but this is only temporary!).\nSince you have already managed to install Ubuntu by running the installer without the graphics card present, you don't need this step.\nThe next step is that you now need to install the proprietary driver on Ubuntu without being able to boot into X.  You could try installing the package nvidia-current.  This can be done using the command line.  There will be an option in your boot loader to boot to command line - if your boot loader doesn't come up then holding SHIFT while booting should do it.\nI can't fully recall, but you may also need to install nvidia-xconfig and run that, to set up your video driver for X after you've installed it.\n\nA: Ok, so I have finally resolved this (at last) The issue seems to have been with the fact I was using a DVI adapter.. I'm assuming Ubuntu wasn't able to read this through the adapter. \nThanks you to neon_overload for all the assistance. I can now move on with trying to get to grips with Ubuntu.\n", "Q: Unity lens to search for tags I want to develop a dash lens to search files by tags (the ones that are set through Nautilus).

Where can I learn how to do it? I have a good knowledge of C/C++ and Linux/POSIX, but I never developed for a graphical interface and less than anything for Unity. I also would want an opinion about the \"tags\" option in Nautilus, is it there to stay? I wouldn't want to develop something that is doomed next version. And finally, if I get it to work, how can I make it public for others to use it?\n\nA: Most of your questions should be answered by looking at the developer pages of ubuntu. \nEspecially:\n\n\n*\n\n*\"I dont' know where to start\":  http://developer.ubuntu.com/get-started/\n\n*\"Where can I learn how to do it\": http://developer.ubuntu.com/resources/\n\n*\"I never developed [...] anything for Unity\": http://developer.ubuntu.com/resources/platform/unity/ especially http://developer.ubuntu.com/resources/technologies/lenses-and-scopes/\n\n*\"tag option in Nautilus\": I have no idea if this is to stay, but I cant find plans to remove it: https://live.gnome.org/Nautilus/Roadmap\n\n*\"Make it public\": http://developer.ubuntu.com/publish/\nAs an additional note: you probably should have a look at \"tracker-tags\", a nautilus extension for tracker-tag support. \n", "Q: Is it needed to set Static IP and Port to get best performance from Transmission? I've recently migrated to Linux from Windows and I work on Ubuntu 12.04 LTS. I am trying to preserve my usual habits of Windows so that I can use Linux more regularly. One of those habits is P2P activity.\nOn Windows, to get the best of my P2P client (uTorrent), I was proceeding as follows:  \n\n\n*\n\n*Set a static IP to my system and  \n\n*Forward a port  \n\n\nDo I need to do the same to make Transmission work at its full capacity?\nIf yes, how to set a static IP in Ubuntu? (hope, its not too complicated for a novice like me) \nI can manage with forwarding a port unless its a specific process for Linux.\n\nA: My transmission works w/o messing with settings. 1 thing you do need to do is to open ports on your router. Transmisson has a button to check if the port is open:\n\nIf it shows 'port is closed' check your router settings. Mine looks like this:\n\n\nA BitTorrent client normally associates the TCP port number 6881. However, if this port is busy for some reason, the client will instead try successively higher ports (6882, 6883, and so on up to a limit of 6999). In order for outside BitTorrent clients to reach this one, they must be able to connect to the correct port.\n\nA: In Short and Simple, No, You don't need to change any settings.\nI use Transmission without changing any settings. The default settings work very good.\n\nA: As I understand it, the settings in Rinwind's helpful answer open a port automatically. They set up port forwarding by using UPnP or NAT-PMP implemented on your router to whatever IP address has been assigned, so a static IP address doesn't need to be used. As long as your router implements one of these protocols I think that's the best answer.\nIf your router doesn't happen to implement either of these protocols you should set the port number in the window in Rinwind's answer, set up a static IP address, and forward the port manually in your router and this will \"open the port\".\nTo set a static IP address you should be able to set one in your router's DHCP configuration. Alternatively you can carefully pick a static IP address that won't ever be selected by your router's DHCP function and edit your network connection to set it in Ubuntu (by right clicking the network connection on the top right of your screen). See https://askubuntu.com/a/7082/63886.\nWhether or not opening a port helps performance depends on your bandwidth and the characteristics of the torrent when you are participating in it. If your bandwidth is low or the number of peers with open ports is high, opening your port may not matter much. Otherwise having an open port makes it easier for others to connect to you and therefore can provide more peers to download from / upload to.\n", "Q: Why are embedded flash videos (like youtube) so heavy on the GPU? I have noticed (in psensor, and listening to the fan) that my GPU is terribly hot when playing youtube videos. \nWhat happens at that point? Is this related to Flash in Ubuntu?\nYoutube in Firefox and Chrome seems to take much more GPU resources than playing the same video or one with a higher resolution from the hard disk, or than playing it from youtube through smplayer (or VLC).\nRelated question here.\n\n\n\nA: This is probably related to the implementation of Adobe Flash (in Ubuntu, or even in general); while the video codecs used by youtube are standardized, how they are implemented is up to Adobe and it may well be a poor implementation and/or one that uses the GPU excessively.\nCompared to that, most Linux/Ubuntu video apps use the FFmpeg/libavcodec open-source codecs to decode video, and they generally do a pretty good job -- in your case, apparently better than the proprietary Flash!\n\nAlternately, you can always give Flash a chance by disabling hardware acceleration (the graphs in the question show that SMPlayer is using software decoding). Full-screen the flash video (it's a bug), right-click, go to Settings and disable:\n\n", "Q: How to install the most stable & latest nvidia driver in 12.04? I have recently installed Ubuntu 12.04 alongside Windows 7.\nAfter completing the Software Update process, I thought that my nVidia drivers also would have been updated, but after restarting the system and checking the version, it still was showing as version 173.14.35.  I have nvidia geforce 7025 / 630a integrated in my ASUS motherboard\nCan someone tell me how can I update my drivers with the most latest and stable release?\nAlso when searching a lot I went through couple of pages which showed something like PPA. Can someone please explain me what is a PPA?\n\nA: Regarding: most latest and stable release\nOpen dash with the super key.\nStart typing addi\nIt will show an icon with additional drivers underneath. Check what drivers it shows and pick one that works best. \nExample: \n\nInstalling drivers with a PPA tends to be bleeding edge and unstable versions or give support to abandoned drivers or old cards etc. Keep away from those if you are not 100% sure how to fix problems that arise from those drivers.\n\nA: COMMENT DELETED: it's not a good idea to install these manually, use the instructions below that others have given because you will run into an issue with the DKMS added Kernel support in 304.22 and it will break your Ubuntu installation if you attempt to revert back to your previous installation of the Nvidia drivers.  It's very complex to fix a bad install of these so I no longer recommend doing it this way.\n\nA: I don't know your graphics card model, so my answer is based on assumption.\nIts looks like your graphics card is old and use legacy 173 driver from nvidia. \nIf so, for your graphics card, there was no development done from nivida in terms of version.\nSo whatever you have is the best and latest driver. If you forcefully install new drivers it will cause lag/crash to your system.\nA ppa is a package bundle provided by 3rd party (meaning any other than Ubuntu official). \nAdding a ppa and installing an app/driver from it means you will be receiving updates for them when the ppa owner updates a page.\nBasically ppa s are for easy install and update process.\nSee more details from this discussion What are PPAs and how do I use them?\n-- Update --\nIf you want stable an updated driver.

But I still can't get Unity 3D to work.\nAt one point I think I saw a lot of \"Additional Drivers\" available but now I have none. How do I get the additional drivers for the HD3000 to make Unity work?\n\nA: The HD3000 driver is built in to the kernel/Ubuntu and no separate drivers (apart from regularly updating Ubuntu) are required. \n\nA: As izx notes, the HD3000 drivers are built into the kernel.

(I have tried on two computers, with Chromium and Firefox on each.) I choose \"Click here to get started\", then the site asks for my cable provider. I choose it, enter my password, and it appears to accept it. The next screen that loads again says \"Click here to get started\". If I click it and choose my provider, it doesn't even ask for my password, it just says signing in and the process repeats. A couple of points:\n\n\n*\n\n*It works fine on Windows XP.\n\n*If I purposely enter a wrong password, it tells me so. This error only occurs if I have the password correct.\n\n\nHas anyone been able to make it work?\n\nA: As per this post on the Adobe website:\nStep One: Install HAL\nsudo apt-get install hal\n\nStep Two: Quit your web browser\nStep Three: Clean out the Adobe Flash folder:\ncd ~/.adobe/Flash_Player\nrm -rf NativeCache AssetCache APSPrivateData2\n\nThis process worked for me.

The only potential issue is competition with other sound players running natively on the workstation.  I had to shut down another sound player on the workstation before starting the VM.\n!!! Notice that \"hal\" has been deprecated -- hal is old stuff.  Adobe has announced that it is discontinuing support for Flash on Linux, so what do we do in a few months???\n\nA: Try:\n\n\n*\n\n*Uninstall moonlight 2.0 plugin\n\n*Install moonlight 3.0\n\n*Play video\n", "Q: .run file is not working. I double click and get: could not display, file is of unknown type So, the only thing I can think of is that Ubuntu did not correctly install some software as it doesn't recognize .run files.

Everything is working but my wireless transfer rates are low. I'm getting about 1MB/s download speed on the ultrabook vs 15MB/s on the E6500. \nIf I move into the room with the access point the speed climbs to 15MB/s so I'm guessing it is a signal strength issue but wavemon shows comparable signals to those seen by the E6500.\nAre there any settings I can tweak in hopes of making it faster?\n\nA: This is advice from rodpott on another forum posting that helped my wife's XPS14z get much better reception.

SOURCE  That may be why a new router solved the issue.\n\nA: I know nothing about Ubuntu, however, I do have a 14z and have along history with the WiFi problems on it. Hence the reason I had a Google news alert setup which fed me your post.   There's a number of posts in the Dell forums on the subject, which might come down to a bad design of the laptop.  Dell has replaced my card twice and my antenna twice, then finally actually down graded the WiFi card to a 6300 (no bluetooth) to see if that would help.  Kinda ticks me off that I don't have bluetooth now, but I'm still int he process of sorting it out with Dell and they have been nothing but great about everything. This card seems to be working better than the OEM card (6330, I think), but still not as good as my iPad sitting right next to it.  \nSome tricks (again, knowing nothing about Ubuntu) you might try:\n\n\n*\n\n*Turn off laptop battery power saving setting which puts card in low performance during low battery.\n\n*Replace drivers with Intel's OEM card drivers.  \n\n*Enable Intel connection settings and mess with the options thereunder.  \n\n\nBest of luck.  Oh, I guess I'd also suggest opening a support ticket to document the problem from the start.\n\nA: I had the same trouble, but not on Ubuntu -- the wifi card pulled 25-50% of what my least capable wifi device could squeeze out of my 20Mbps connection. I got a new system through customer support, and the card worked much better. Then, I upgraded my router (I picked up a new Netgear 600, the white one designed to like Macs and PCs) for $99. That fixed the problem.\nGood luck -- I know the feeling of running and re-running that speed test! And for what it's worth, once this machine is running right it's a real joy.\n", "Q: I don't know what to do next after I installed Ubuntu using VMware.

I am running it on a Compaq Presario CQ42-291tx. I have an additional monitor from my previous desktop PC. Problem arise when i have to work and my friends wants to watch movies. I know that I can connect my monitor with my laptop. I saw it in windows, and it works here fine.\nIs it possible to assign a player to play movie file on an external desktop monitor while I am working with another application on my laptop monitor?\n\nA: Multiple monitors are usually handled by the vendor proprietary drivers.  After you install those (check \"additional drivers\" under Dash or system/administration), you should have a vendor supplied control program.  Run this, and ensure that \"clone\" is unchecked, so you get two distinct desktops, select how the desktops are connected (right/left etc.) by moving the little screen images around.  By running the movie on one desktop for the external monitor, you can then use the other desktop for your work.\n", "Q: How do I compile sndpeek on the latest ubuntu? What do I sudo apt-get as prerequisite to be able to make install sndpeek.  Also, there are three options, make linux-alsa, make linux-oss, and make linux-jack.  Which is appropriate to current out-of-the-box ubuntu?\n\nA: Compiling sndpeek (and one of its dependencies) is possible on Ubuntu 12.04, but slightly tricky, so bear with me for this longish tutorial. The mailing lists on the site are useful when you run into problems.\nFirstly, there are several dependencies that need to be installed. One is mentioned on the Princeton site and is libsndfile; this needs to be compiled from source itself. Download the source from the site and verify the downloaded file with the gpg signature(see elsewhere on this site for how to do that).\nNow it is a simple case of moving to the downloaded folder and running:\n./configure\nmake\nsudo make install or sudo checkinstall\n\nHowever, I have found that other dependencies are necessary for a successful compile; some of which are mentioned in this article. I have added the others that are necessary to this command:\nsudo apt-get install libxmu-dev libxi-dev libglui-dev freeglut3-dev libglui2c2 libasound2-dev\n\nNow download sndpeek from the site, unpack it and cd to the folder, then cd to the src folder, which contains a marsyas and a sndpeek folder. As per the useful article here , you need to add #include <cstdlib> to marsyas/LPC.cpp\nand #include <cstdio> to sndpeek/RTAudio.cpp. Please place these additions near the other #include instructions at the tops of the files. I found that I did not have to run in terminal export PKG_CONFIG_PATH=/usr/local/lib/pkgconfig, which the readme advocated, so it should not be necessary.\nIf you have been following these instructions, you should already be in the src folder, so now move to the sndpeek folder within that folder and run make: there will be a choice, as you know, but I would choose alsa. \nmake linux-alsa\nsudo make install or sudo checkinstall\n\nNow enter sndpeek in the terminal to launch it, speak into your microphone to give it some input and you will get a waveform as in the screenshot below. \n\nAfter you have launched the program, a list of options appears in the terminal, so you can experiment with it as you like: you can, for example, alter the size and nature of the waveform and other effects. There is also the same list of sndpeek options on the official site, which you can print off for reference. You can, for example, play some music with sndpeek (although this was tested with an ogg file, and it will not play all formats): \nsndpeek /location/of/track\n\n\n", "Q: Ubuntu Partition Permissions I have just one partition with all my data on it.

I'd like to install Ubuntu in my computer. I learned that if I install an alternate version, I can choose the .deb packages I need. But when I log in the system, I always face the problem that there are some packages I should have installed which I have not.\nI tried a desktop version, and it ran well. So it must be that I made some mistakes when installed it.\nSo where can I get a list of .deb packages, and what are these .debs used for?\n\nA: .deb packages are basically the installable Applications packages ( similar to Windows .exe ) packed by and for Ubuntu. \nThe Ubuntu Alternate Cd version avails advanced mode of installation suited for experienced and professional users to control every part of Installation.\nFor viewing the .deb packages and the application related to them , you can visit Packages.Ubuntu.com.\nFor installing through Alternate CD , you can view this Illustrated guide \nFor installing other packages that you thought was missing , you can search for them in Ubuntu software center available in the Dash menu or by pressing super+A keys , or through Ubuntu Applications Web page. \n\nA: .deb files are debian package files. These are often used to install programs. Alternate versions (of Ubuntu) are just Ubuntu with a different list of .debs. Ubuntu Software Center installs these .deb files.

Ubuntu will boot up and the time will be off by -4 hours.  If I correct the time in Ubuntu then when I boot up in Windows XP the time will be off by + 4 hours.\nThis is a fresh install of 12.04. I did not have this problem before reinstalling Ubuntu.\n\nA: To set the BIOS clock to local time instead of UTC in a systemd-based version (15.04 and above), you will have to use the timedatectl command. According to the Arch Wiki:\n\nYou can set the hardware clock time standard through the command line.\n  You can check what you have set to use by:\n$ timedatectl | grep local\n\nThe hardware clock can be queried and set with the timedatectl\n  command. To change the hardware clock time standard to localtime, use:\n# timedatectl set-local-rtc 1\n\nIf you want to revert to the hardware clock being in UTC, do:\n# timedatectl set-local-rtc 0\n\n\n\nA: Your time zone is Eastern, which is currently EDT (Eastern Daylight Time). EDT is UTC minus four hours, the same as the offset you're experiencing.\nWhen this happens on a dual-boot system, it's usually because one operating system thinks the hardware clock tracks local time, while the other operating system thinks the hardware clock tracks UTC.\nIn your case, your hardware clock is probably set to the local time, and:\n\n\n*\n\n*Windows is set to use local time, which (given your time settings) is correct.\n\n*Ubuntu is set to use UTC, which (given your time settings) is incorrect.\n\n\nIf you were to just reset the time in the Ubuntu system, either manually or automatically, it would then be wrong in Windows, so that's not a good solution.\nInstead, the best solution is probably to reconfigure Ubuntu to treat the hardware clock time as local time (then you can leave your Windows configuration, and your hardware clock time, alone).\nTo do this, edit /etc/default/rcS as root and make sure it has UTC=no:\n\n\n*\n\n*Press Alt+F2.\n\n*Type gksu gedit /etc/default/rcS and press Enter.\n\n*You'll probably see this:\n# assume that the BIOS clock is set to UTC time (recommended)\nUTC=yes\n\n\n\n*\n\n*If you do, change UTC=yes to UTC=no. (Or you might want to add a comment too, by changing it to something like UTC=no # changed to accommodate Windows system. Everything on a line after a # character is a comment, and is there just to make your settings more human-readable.)\n\n*If you don't, look for any UTC= line. If it's uncommented (i.e., doesn't have a # at the beginning), change it accordingly. If it is commented, uncomment it by removing the leading # and make sure it says UTC=no.\n\n\n*Save the file and quit the text editor.\n\n*Reboot to apply your changes and check that the time is working properly now on both operating systems.\nSource: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/UbuntuTime#Make_Linux_use_.27Local.27_time \n(But that is very general; I have written this answer to apply specifically to your situation, which is a somewhat common problem.)\n\nA: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/UbuntuTime#Multiple_Boot_Systems_Time_Conflicts\n\nMultiple Boot Systems Time Conflicts\nOperating systems store and retrieve the time in the hardware clock\n  located on your motherboard so that it can keep track of the time even\n  when the system does not have power. Most operating systems\n  (Linux/Unix/Mac) store the time on the hardware clock as UTC by\n  default, though some systems (notably Microsoft Windows) store the\n  time on the hardware clock as the 'local' time. This causes problems\n  in a dual boot system if both systems view the hardware clock\n  differently.\nThe advantage of having the hardware clock as UTC is that you don't\n  need to change the hardware clock when moving between timezones or\n  when Daylight Savings Time (DST) begins or ends as UTC does not have\n  DST or timezone offsets.\nChanging Linux to use local time is easier and more reliable than\n  changing Windows to use UTC, so dual-boot Linux/Windows systems tend\n  to use local time.\nSince Intrepid (8.10), UTC=yes is default.\nMake Windows use UTC\nNote: This method was not initially supported on Windows Vista and Server 2008, but came back with Vista SP2, Windows 7, Server 2008 R2\n  and Windows 8/8.1.\nTo make MS Windows calculate the time from the hardware clock as UTC.\nCreate a file named WindowsTimeFixUTC.reg with the following\n  contents and then double click on it to merge the contents with the\n  registry:\nWindows Registry Editor Version 5.00\n[HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\\SYSTEM\\CurrentControlSet\\Control\\TimeZoneInformation]\n     \"RealTimeIsUniversal\"=dword:00000001\n\nNote: Windows Time service will still write local time to the RTC regardless of the registry setting above on shutdown, so it is handy\n  to disable Windows Time service with this command (if time sync is\n  still required while in Windows use any third-party time sync\n  solution):\nsc config w32time start= disabled\n\nReversing the change You can create a file with the following\n  contents and then double-click it to merge in the original changes, as\n  above:\nWindows Registry Editor Version 5.00\n[HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\\SYSTEM\\CurrentControlSet\\Control\\TimeZoneInformation]\n     \"RealTimeIsUniversal\"=-\n\nIf Windows Time service was disabled, enable it again with the\n  command:\nsc config w32time start= demand\n\nMake Linux use 'Local' time\nTo tell your Ubuntu system that the hardware clock is set to 'local'\n  time:\nPre-Ubuntu 15.04 systems (e.g. Ubuntu 14.04 LTS):\n  \n  \n*\n  \n*edit /etc/default/rcS\n  \n*add or change the following section\n# Set UTC=yes if your hardware clock is set to UTC (GMT)\nUTC=no\n\nUbuntu 15.04 systems and above (e.g. Ubuntu 16.04 LTS):\n  \n  \n*\n  \n*open a terminal and execute the following command\ntimedatectl set-local-rtc 1\n\n\n\nA: \nWe can ask Windows to sync time with the network on every reboot:\n\n*\n\n*Search for \"Services\" from the start menu.\n\n*Locate \"Windows Time\".\n\n*Set \"Startup type\" to \"Automatic\". In my case, the time updates at about 10 seconds after logging in to Windows.\n\nOn Ubuntu, we can set \"Automatic Date & Time\" in settings, and by default, it runs on every reboot automatically.\nThis is my favorite approach as it does not require modifying the registry or setting Linux to use \"local\" time, which might have side effects such as daylight saving time synchronization.\nSee this answer and this answer for more reference.\n\nA: The /etc/rcS fix did not work on my Win7 / Ubuntu 14.04x64 installation, nor did any fixes through the clock GUI.  Because the root of the problem is BIOS time VS UTC time, and Windows is a pain in the butt when it comes to using UTC, I just picked a point on the map that uses UTC+0 (no change between BIOS and UTC time).\nTry changing your location to Reykjavik (the capital of Iceland).  Voila!  Your Ubuntu time will change to match your BIOS time.\n\nA: I had 1h of difference on each time I boot into linux or windows. It's because one is on UTC ant the other one in RTC\nTo fix my ubuntu 20.04 I used this:\ntimedatectl set-local-rtc 1 --adjust-system-clock\n\nin my case to go back to UTC you can\ntimedatectl set-local-rtc 0 --adjust-system-clock\n\nand if you want to check what you're using you can type that:\ntimedatectl\n", "Q: How can I restore default GRUB looks?

Both directory should store the last versions of files. So if any changes occur in one directory, they must be reflected into another one and vice verse. Also all changes ( not matter how large they were: remove of 1GB file or a simple text line addition) should be stored. Of course, rollback should be available.\nTo make a certain notion of what I am talking about here it is some examples.\n\n\n*\n\n*Dropbox - system make a synchronization of local storage and remote. It has a backup and version control feature. Very good system I like it, I use it, but it only works for local directory and for remote Dropbox storage.

Follow this guide, but put your repo somewhere else (NOT the place you want to sync with!) and then git init the two syncing places, and connect them to the repo you made by adding remotes. Done! You can now use Git to sync your two places by adding, committing, pushing and pulling.\n", "Q: python ctypes and pulseaudio segfault after upgrade to 12.04 Today I finally took the plunge and upgraded my desktop machine from 11.10 to 12.04 using the upgrade process, not a fresh install. One of the first things I tested after the upgrade completed was a little python library I have that plays sound through pulseaudio, basically a python 2.x port of the answer to https://askubuntu.com/a/33602/55992\nThis code now segfaults at the final line, whereas it didn't before the upgrade:\nimport ctypes\nimport struct\n\nPA_SAMPLE_FLOAT32LE = 5\nPA_STREAM_PLAYBACK = 1\n\npa = ctypes.cdll.LoadLibrary(\"libpulse-simple.so.0\")\npa.pa_strerror.restype = ctypes.c_char_p\n\npat_sample_spec = ctypes.c_buffer(struct.pack(\"=LLB\", PA_SAMPLE_FLOAT32LE, 44100, 2))    \nerror = ctypes.c_int(0)\n\ns = pa.pa_simple_new(0, \"Python\", PA_STREAM_PLAYBACK, 0, \"Test\", ctypes.byref(pat_sample_spec), 0, 0, ctypes.byref(error))\n\nWhat is weird is that this same code works on a laptop I have that I did a fresh install of 12.04 on a couple months ago. I am running python 2.7.3 on both systems.\nAny ideas on what is broken? Does it work for others?\nEDIT: I should note that I can get this to limp along by messing around with it a bit, e.g. once just by adding a few print lines for debugging before the pa_simple_new call I was able to avoid a segfault and everything worked properly, but this solution seems hacky and unstable, something is wrong here.\nEDIT2: Here is the backtrace (hope I am doing this right, I am not experienced with gdb):\n#0  0x00007ffff5d7ba69 in pa_channel_map_valid () from /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libpulse.so.0\n#1  0x00007ffff5fb99a7 in pa_simple_new () from /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libpulse-simple.so.0\n#2  0x00007ffff61d6ea4 in ffi_call_unix64 () from /usr/lib/python2.7/lib-dynload/_ctypes.so\n#3  0x00007ffff61d68c5 in ffi_call () from /usr/lib/python2.7/lib-dynload/_ctypes.so\n#4  0x00007ffff61c72c2 in _ctypes_callproc () from /usr/lib/python2.7/lib-dynload/_ctypes.so\n#5  0x00007ffff61c7aa2 in ??

I would be surprised if 32 vs 64 bit is the issue though, this code worked just fine on this same machine before the upgrade to 12.04.\n\nA: Finally fixed it. The moral of the story: be careful about copying code off the internet that \"looks right\" but you haven't really worked through yourself.\nThe sample spec struct buffer string above is actually a slight modification of the code to  How do I write raw bytes to a sound-device?  - it forces native byte order but no alignment via the \"=\", unlike the original code which has native byte order and alignment (like a C implementation would have). I can't remember why I would have ever done that. However, neither works, and I can't understand how things possibly worked before. First, \"L\" on a 64-bit system is 8 bytes, whereas the pulseaudio code (pulse/sample.h) is using 32-bit (4 byte) integer types for the first 2 fields of the struct. Second, using c_buffer without a length argument is adding a null terminator, actually increasing the length of the buffer representing the struct by one byte.\nYou would think fixing this would make everything happy, but no. I created a buffer using the bytes generated vs dumping the memory from an equivalent C program, and still no dice. Something must be going on in ctypes. After actually reading the ctypes page  from start to finish rather than just skimming it for what I need, I settled upon the following more ctypes-strict implementation, using an actual Structure subclass (and passing null pointers as \"None\", which doesn't change things but is still nice):\nimport ctypes\nimport struct\n\nPA_SAMPLE_FLOAT32LE = 5\nPA_STREAM_PLAYBACK = 1\n\npa = ctypes.cdll.LoadLibrary(\"libpulse-simple.so.0\")\n\nclass SampleSpec(ctypes.Structure):\n    _fields_ = [(\"format\", ctypes.c_int), (\"rate\", ctypes.c_int), (\"channels\", ctypes.c_byte)]\n\npa_sample_spec = SampleSpec(PA_SAMPLE_FLOAT32LE, 44100, 2)\n\nerror = ctypes.c_int(0)\n\ns = pa.pa_simple_new(None, \"Python\", PA_STREAM_PLAYBACK, None, \"Test\", ctypes.byref(pa_sample_spec), None, None, ctypes.byref(error))\n\nNo segfault, and all my old code to pump audio through this works.

But creating a new group shouldn't affect /etc/sudoers. You must have done something else.\nThe way to recover from this (short of reinstalling) is to boot into a single-user root shell. From there, you can fix /etc/sudoers, and whatever else needs fixing. Be careful while you're doing this; it's very easy to break the system by manually editing system files like this and frankly you've already done so.\nTo get a single-user root shell, see this question.

It's used for the same purpose Virtual memory is used in Windows, you run out of RAM Swap is used, you want to Hibernate/Suspend Swap is used.\nIf you did selected your D:/ partition to be used as Swap, then it's simply gone.\n\nA: After about 40 hours of googeling and experimenting I found that the solution was a simple as this:\n\n\n*\n\n*start testdisk from ubuntu\n\n*select your drive (usually the default - intel)\n\n*select \"Advanced\" \n\nIn case you do not get the \"List\" option:\n\n\n*\n\n*select the swap partition, and at the bottom menu select \"Type\" \n\n*press enter and enter \" 7\"  when it asks for the type (original should be 82)\n\n*DO NOT REBOOT, even if it tells you to (messed up alot of stuff for me)\n\n\n\n*\n\n*repeat step 1 tot 2, but now select \"List\" \n\n*search for the files you want to backup, press C and select the directory that you want to copy to (has to be on a different partition)\nUnfortunately after all the previous messing with partitions I have lost literally every file that I was hoping to get back. But it still seems I have about 60% left of everything else.\nI still have an image from ddrescue that might be my final hope.\n", "Q: How to get cursor click effect? I've seen videos like this one in which a effect appears when the user made a click. What I want it's just the effect only, I don't care the colour of the cursor.\nHow can I make this effect when I do a click in Ubuntu 11.10?\n\nA: You can install key-mon which apart from showing the mouse clicks,can also show key presses.For locating the mouse-pointer you have to run the command:\nkey-mon --visible_click\n\n\nA: For Ubuntu 20.04, I found the solution here\nThese are the commands listed in the video:\n$sudo add-apt-repository  ppa:nrbrtx/python2-stuff\n\n$sudo apt-get update\n\n$sudo apt-get install key-mon\n\nand then you can check the option \"Highly Visible Click \"\n\n\nA: As indicated in this very similar question, your best option appears to be using keymon; it is fairly easy to customize it for an effect similar to what you see in your video.\n1. Install keymon\nFrom the Software Center, or via sudo apt-get install key-mon\n2. Make its window minimal and enable the click indicator\n\n*\n\n*The default window shows mouse and keyboard status, like:\n\n\n\n*Unless you want it, let's get rid of all these; right-click on it window, and chose Settings:. Then, uncheck everything under Buttons:\n\n\n\n*and set up the Misc tab as:\n\n\n\n*This leaves you with a minimal status window:\n\n\n*\n\n*And the default click-indicator, which you don't like very much :)\n\n3. Customizing the mouse-click indicator and making the KeyMon window disappear\n\n*\n\n*First, let's make the keymon window disappear. Simply run it from the terminal (you can set up a launcher, script or startup too) as:\nkey-mon --scale=0.1\n\n\n*Next, the files we need to modify are in /usr/shared/pyshared/keymon, so cd to that folder.\n\n\n*Make the click-indicator bolder: in shaped_window.py, find win.set_opacity(0.5) around line 58 and change the 0.5 to 1.0\n\n\n*Increase the fade-out time: at the end of shaped_window.py, find gobject.timeout_add(200, self.hide) and change the 200 to e.g. 750 (it's in milliseconds)\n\n\n*Change the indicator: The indicators are simply SVG files, under themes/*/mouse-indicator.svg; you can edit these with Inkscape, etc. to customize it to whatever you want to be.\n\n*\n\n*To get you started, I've created a red square like the one in your video. To \"install it\", just make sure keymon is not running, and download it this way (SVGs are just text files):\n\nsudo wget http://pastebin.com/raw.php?i=rBnUiXWh -O/usr/share/pyshared/keymon/themes/classic/mouse-indicator.svg\n\n\n*Now start keymon, and you'll see a nice red fading-out indicator like the one in your video around the cursor whenever you click/drag:\n\nYoutube Video Demo\n\nA: Without having to install anything, the only option is to enable \"Show position of pointer when Ctrl is pressed\"\n\n\n*\n\n*Go to System Settings > Mouse and Touchpad\n\n*Check the box that says: \"Show position of pointer when Control key is pressed\"\n\n*Done. \n\n\nPress Ctrl and an orange radiating circle should show the position of the pointer.\n\nA: You can achieve a similar thing with the Water effect in Compiz.\nFirst watch a video about it (grabbed it on youtube): http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7pcLv8XuGKM  The results on the video may look like that it's not what you want, but you can change the settings later after you had enabled it.\nThen definitely read What are some of the issues with ccsm and why should I not use it?\nThen start.\nFirst, install Compiz-Config by searching it in the Software center.\n\nThen, open the program by searching CompizConfig Settings Manager.\n\nSearch for Water Effect and select the option\n\nEnable the effect, set a custom shortcut by clicking the option on Initiate, then click on the shortcut that you assigned, then have fun!\nThe effects might not be the one you wanted, so fool around with the 2 sliders until you like what you saw.\n\nA: On KDE Plasma 5.18 LTS / Kubuntu 20.04 LTS it's built in, no extra software installation needed\n\n", "Q: How to start Thunderbird minimized on start-up? I followed this tutorial to set start Thunderbird in minimized mode at startup, but it wasn't helpful. \nAfter following the instructions, I could not even start Thunderbird. So I was forced to start TB in safe mode to delete the \"FireTray Plugin\" and fix this issue. After that it started to work but it deleted all my email accounts and I had to do that chore all over again .\nSo is there any working way to start Thunderbird minimized on start-up?\n\nA: I used this addon to start thunderbird in minimized mode by default and added a startup entry for thunderbird by following this guide.\n\nA: Let me make it clear, at least for people like me.\nMaking sure that thunderbird is automatically started on logon, involves just three steps:\n\n\n*\n\n*Install \"FireTray\" addon on thunderbird \n\n*check \"start application hidden to tray\" option in FireTray preferences (Thunderbird -> Tools -> addons -> firetray -> preferences -> under tab \"windows\")\n\n*Follow this answer (its quick) to add thunderbird to startup (Note: the command field therein should be: thunderbird or /usr/bin/thunderbird)\n\n\nNote that FireTray addon is a must have. Most people don't actually mean to quit entirely like the default behavior is,  when they say \"close\" to window. They sure expect thunderbird to run in background and notify of all new email arrivals. And FireTray deals exactly with this problem.\n\nA: http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=1529056\n\nA: I am actually using Ubuntu 13.10, but this solution should work fine at least back to 12.04. Firetray is an extension for Firefox that makes it so you can minimize to tray on close, and minimize on startup (you'll see the Thunderbird window popup for a quick second, but it's hardly an issue). Then just add thunderbird to Startup Applications and when you login thunderbird will flash for a second then be minimized in your system tray. It also has full support for the default messaging menu so it doesn't create a secondary thunderbird icon.\nNow for those that may have tried this in the past, I know that I tried Firetray a couple years ago and it wouldn't work at all, it had lots of bugs when used with modern Ubuntu, but the latest version seems to work flawlessly with Ubuntu (at least version 13.10, but I don't see why it wouldn't work with any other version).\n\nA: For Ubuntu 18.04+\n\n*\n\n*Install devilspie package:\nsudo apt install devilspie\n\n\n*Create ~/.devilspie folder and thunderbird.ds file in that folder:\nmkdir -p ~/.devilspie && touch ~/.devilspie/thunderbird.ds\n\n\n*Paste this code in ~/.devilspie/thunderbird.ds file:\n(if\n    (or\n        (is (window_name) \"Mozilla Thunderbird\")\n        (is (window_name) \"Home - Mozilla Thunderbird\")\n    )\n    (begin\n       (minimize)\n    )\n)\n\n\n\n*Add devilspie to Startup Applications\n\n\n*Add thunderbird to Startup Applications\n\n\n*Optionally install Minimize on Close (add-on for Thunderbird that makes the Close button behave exactly like the\nMinimize one)\n\n\n*Reboot.\nTip: How to delay a specific program on startup\ndevilspie' docs:\n\n*\n\n*https://web.archive.org/web/20160415011438/http://foosel.org/linux/devilspie\n\n*https://wiki.gnome.org/Projects/DevilsPie\n\n*https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Devilspie\n\nAlternative: Devilspie2\n\nA: *\n\n*Press [Alt]+F2 to run command \n\n*Run gnome-session-properties \n\n*Add /usr/bin/thunderbird\n\nA: Ubuntu 16.04.\nHad the same problem and used following to achieve the goal.

Temperature is determined more by what the CPU is doing rather than the raw clock speed so there's probably not much benefit to reducing the clock speed.

They're both the same. One is built into the motherboard, the other is a PCI-E card. I'm using the built in one, but neither are working anymore. The only change I've recently made to my system until my Ethernet stopped working was to install Mint KDE 12.04 64bit as a dual boot. The strange thing is, that the built in Ethernet card works fine in that every time. That kernel is a 3.2 one.\nSo all of a sudden, Ifconfig tells me that there's no eth0 showing. \ndmesg | grep r816 gives me nothing.\n\nI've checked out just about every launchpad/ask ubuntu/ubuntu forum link I can find and the best results I get are from here:\n\n\n*\n\n*The pain of an Realtek (RTL8111/RTL8168) ethernet card\nI've even tried the $(uname -r) option & the blacklist of the r8169 was already there from a couple of years ago, when I had a similar issue on this machine.

(I use a Cinnamon applet for recording the screen.) The magnifier that comes with accessibility applet of Cinnamon is not very good.\nI used to use Enhanced Zoom Desktop feature in older versions of Ubuntu. So I installed CompizConfig Settings Manager and enabled the feature but nothing happens when I try the combination I set.\nIs there a way to get it working? Or do you know any other magnifier application?\n\nA: Cinnamon is based on Gnome Shell, which uses Mutter. It doesn't use Compiz, so the settings you are changing will have no effect here. They will only apply when you use Unity.\nTo enable zooming in Cinnamon, open System Settings, and choose the Universal Access panel. There is a switch to turn the feature on, and you can set additional options there. For example, the Screen part option lets you split the screen in half so one half shows everything zoomed out and the other half has everything zoomed in (centred around your mouse pointer). This might be useful if you are looking for something more like a magnifier.\nIf there are shortcuts set for activating zoom and changing the zoom level, they will be listed beside the switch to turn Zoom on and off. If these shortcuts are not set, open the Keyboard settings panel, and look for Universal Access in the Shortcuts tab. You can set those shortcuts as you please. Unfortunately it is not possible to zoom in or out with the mouse wheel, but hopefully this will do the trick.\n\nA: Cinnamon doesn't normally use Compiz and hence doesn't support any Compiz plugins. The Cinnamon effects are deliberately designed to look like Compiz' effects, but they're completely different things. I don't know if Cinnamon has anything identical to the effect you want. \n", "Q: Is there an API for accessing historical Ubuntu Security Notices? I'm working on an automated security audit system which analyses custom Ubuntu installations to check for packages affected by security vulnerabilities. Since these machines are not connected to the internet I cannot simple run apt-get, and we need to keep the upgrades as small as possible so only updating packages when they are actually needed.\nPart of this process is to monitor the Ubuntu Security Notices (USN) for new reports and extract information. However, I can't find a way to easily access all of the historical USN notices.\nThere is an RSS feed linked on http://www.ubuntu.com/usn/ but it only returns the most recent 50 reports, which won't work as I'm dealing with older Ubuntu versions and need to check historical reports.\nThe two options I can see, neither of which are nice, are to scrape the email archives or scrape the website.

Today, as I've issued the apt-get upgrade command, I've noticed there is Skype update in the list. I am absolutely happy with the old Skype 2.2.0.35 Beta and definitely don't want anything to change.\nWhat I want is not only to forbid the package to update but to save it for future installations too. How can I achieve this?\n\nA: You want to keep a particular version of the package skype for the foreseeable future, even when newer versions are available, and even if you install Ubuntu again from scratch.\nFirst, assuming this beta version is packaged the same way as the current version, there are actually two packages--skype, and skype-bin.\nThere are two things you must do, for each of these packages:\n\n\n*\n\n*Pin them at their current versions so they're left alone when you update software. That's been covered in this question:\n\n\n*\n\n*How to prevent updating of a specific package?\n\n\n*Keep copies of the .deb package files used to install them. You'll probably find them in /var/cache/apt/archives. Their names should begin with skype_2.2.0.35- and skype-bin_2.2.0.35- (and both end in .deb).\nBack them up, and if you have to reinstall Ubuntu from scratch or if you want to install this version of Skype on another machine, just install those packages. One way to install them is to run this command, after cding to the folder that contains the .deb files:\nsudo dpkg -i skype_2.2.0.35-*.deb skype-bin_2.2.0.35-*.deb\n\nIf you're told one or both of these packages can't be completely configured because you don't have the necessary dependencies installed, make sure you're connected to the Internet and run these commands:\nsudo apt-get -f install\nsudo dpkg --configure -a\n\nFinally, please note that if you continue to use an old version of Skype that is no longer supported upstream:\n\n\n*\n\n*It may stop working, or stop working properly, over time.\n\n*It may contain security vulnerabilities fixed in later versions.\n\n\nA: For forbidding updating it, you could pin the package.\nFirst find out what priority it's being installed in with. here's an example\n$ sudo apt-cache policy skype\nskype:\n  Installed: 4.0.0.8-1~precise\n  Candidate: 4.0.0.8-1~precise\n  Version table:\n *** 4.0.0.8-1~precise 0\n        500 http://ppa.launchpad.net/upubuntu-com/chat/ubuntu/ precise/main amd64 Packages\n        100 /var/lib/dpkg/status\n     4.0.0.8-0oneiric1 0\n        500 http://archive.canonical.com/ubuntu/ precise/partner amd64 Packages\n$ \n\nThen you can create a file. The lowest priority in this example is 100, so anything below that should make the package not upgrade, despite newer versions being available.\nUbuntu looks for pinning instructions in /etc/apt/preferences.d/.  For example, if you are using Ubuntu Precise (12.04), you can create this file telling it to set all packages named skype for precise with priority 90, which will make it prefer the current installed package (which has priority at least 100).\n$ cat  /etc/apt/preferences.d/skype\nPackage: skype\nPin: release n=precise\nPin-Priority: 90\n\nI was told you can do this with synaptic as well.\nAs for downloading the package, once you've pinned the version you want: \n$ apt-get download skype\n\n", "Q: How permanent can a WUBI install be? Just installed Ubuntu 12.04 via WUBI to my Lenovo IdeaPad laptop. I originally wanted to dual boot with my Windows7, but the windows7/Lenovo combination is configured to take up 4 primary partitions, and my hard drive is a bit to small for a logical partition install. So I thought I would do a WUBI install before getting a larger hard drive to accommodate a larger install on logical partitions.\nQuestion: My WUBI install is working out really nicely in fact. Everything is fast and dandy, and it out performs the windows OS already there. So, is it worth migrating to a permanent install if WUBI is as nice as this? Or will there be problems down the road?\n\nA: Wubi is less tested than normal Ubuntu installs, since a lot of people and particularly developers, do not have Windows installed. So when you use a Wubi install, it's even more important to keep backups and particularly when doing distribution upgrades. \nA working Wubi install shouldn't degrade much in performance or things like that. You may want to defrag your host filesystem from time to time, but you'll probably want to do that anyway. I don't think it'll be too significant in any case. \nNormally, I would recommend doing a normal install for a permanent installation, but it sounds to me like you've found a very good exception. \n\nA: If Your Wubi install is working that great, then I don't think you need to worry about another normal installation. \nAs Jo-Erlend Schinstad says, You may want to defragment tools on Windows system on the Wubi partition.\nAs the answer of the Title: I'd say, It is permanent as permanent your Windows is and your own decision is. If you want to remove Ubuntu, it's a matter of seconds to do so from Add/Remove program. (I myself find it less permanent, cause I have a habit of regular program removing ;P)\nYou may want to check these links\n\n\n*\n\n*What's the difference between Wubi and a regular \"alongside Windows\" installation? \n\n*Official Wubi Guide\n", "Q: Sharing Connection to other PCs (Via Wired Ethernet) I have two desktop PCs I use frequently, both running Ubuntu 12.04. One is connected to the internet via wireless, and the other has no wireless card. Is there any way I can share my internet connection across the ethernet ports?\n\nA: Sharing internet connection via ethernet is one step more than doing it wirelessly. Here are the steps:\nPC Sharing Connection\nPC that will share connection\n\n*\n\n*Open your Network Manager via the Network Icon on the Unity Panel:\n\n\n\n*Go all the way down to the Edit Connections option and click on it.\n\n\n\n*You will appear on the Wired Tab. Each Wired connection is by default related to each Ethernet Wired NIC card you have. For example if you have 2 Wired NICs you will see 2 options here. In the image below you see one since this is a Laptop and they normally have one. Select the Wired connection you wish to edit and double click on it or select the EDIT button.\n\n\n\n*You will appear on the Wired Tab (Again). This time, go to the IPv4 Settings if you are using IPv4 or IPv6 if you are using that one. On the Method option select Share to Other Computers. Now SAVE. You are done.\n\nThis will do all the stuff that was normally done 6 or 7 years ago with all the terminal commands and iptable stuff.\nNow just connect the 2 computers and you are done.\nNOTE: If both computers have a Wired Gigabit Ethernet NIC then you can actually connect them directly since most 1000BASE-T have automatic MDI/MDI-X. If not just connect them to your switch, router, hub, whatever and that is all.\nClient PC\nPC That will receive Shared Internet Connection (Depends on Network Setup)\n\n*\n\n*Open your Network Manager via the Network Icon on the Unity Panel:\n\n\n\n*Go all the way down to the Edit Connections option and click on it.\n\n\n\n*You will appear on the Wired Tab. Each Wired connection is by default related to each Ethernet Wired NIC card you have. For example if you have 2 Wired NICs you will see 2 options here. In the image below you see one since this is a Laptop and they normally have one. Select the Wired connection you wish to edit and double click on it or select the EDIT button.\n\n\n\n*You will appear on the Wired Tab (Again). This time, go to the IPv4 Settings if you are using IPv4 or IPv6 if you are using that one. On the Method option select Manual. The options in Addresses will be editable now. Add the IP you want, the Mask you need and the IP of the PC that is sharing the connection. In this case I said that the IP of the Client PC will be 192.168.0.2, the Mask is 255.255.255.0 to imply that is a Class C (LAN) network and 192.168.0.1 to mention that the computer sharing the connection has the IP 192.168.0.1 with it. Additionally add the same IP of the computer sharing the connection to the DNS Servers (As shown in the image).\n\nYou can also (Depending on the network setup) select instead of Manual, select Automatic and just put the IP of the computer sharing the Internet in the DNS Servers section.\n\nNote that this depends on the network setup. For example if you have both PCs connected to a switch or router, the switch/router will take care of the Client, so you only need to setup the PC Sharing Internet and just connect both to the switch/router. If by chance you are connecting the PCs directly together then it is better to do the additional setup of the Client.\nIn most cases, you will not need to setup the client, just connect to the network and done. Ubuntu will take care of everything. I just added the Client part for specific cases where problems might arise.\nThis should cover all the possible scenarios in a home LAN when one wants to share the internet connection over Wired cable.\n\nA: Yes, it's actually quite easy. \n\n\n*\n\n*Open the Network Menu on your panel and select \"Edit connections\"\n\n*Select the wired connection and click Properties.\n\n*In this dialog, open the IPv4 tab. \n\n*In the \"Method\" combo, select \"Shared with other computers\". \n\n\nNow, whatever is connected to the wired network port will get access to whatever internet connection you use. \n", "Q: How to create a VNC server such that each user can have access using its own user/password combination I would like to know which software of what is the procedure to create a VNC server such that each user can have access using its own user/password combination ?\n\nA: You can use X11VNC for that. I don't know if there's any particular reason why you have to use VNC, but if you just want a remote desktop solution over SSH, you may want to have a look at http://x2go.com, which is an NX-based solution to provide just that.

Is there a way to do this without automatically logging into the desktop? Much thanks!\n\nA: No, the VNC server that comes with Ubuntu is not designed for that. There are many other solutions though. I would probably recommend X2Go or FreeNX, but there are also VNC servers that allows you to do this, such as X11VNC. \n", "Q: Ubuntu 12.04 Bootloader failed to install Sorry about the excessively long question, but I figured giving more information would be better.\nI recently bought a new desktop for myself, running Windows 7. It has two hard drives, and I wanted to install Ubuntu on a small partition on the second hard drive. I created 25GB \"free space\" in Windows and ran a LiveCD install. I wanted to select the install options myself but accidentally selected \"Install alongside Windows 7,\" but it seemed to pick up the free space and installed itself there as I wanted it to. However, I was told that the bootloader installation had failed. I chose to \"Cancel installation,\" leaving my computer unable to boot. I wiped my computer and reinstalled Windows.\nAfter that, I tried installing Ubuntu through Windows using WUBI, once using files from my LiveCD and once downloading everything again. Both times the install succeeded, but both times when I restarted and tried to load Ubuntu, it gave me an error - wubildr.mbr was corrupt or missing. I checked in Windows - it was indeed present on the C:\\ drive.\nI went back to the LiveCD installation, this time going the custom options route. I assigned 16GB to an Ext4 journaling file system and 10GB to a swap file. I got the same bootloader error as before. Being prompted to select a different partition to install the bootloader to, I first tried the partition Ubuntu was installed on. A window came up saying that the install had succeeded, but a second window gave me the same error and choices as before. I went through every single option it gave me, including the Windows partition and the hard drives themselves (dev/sda, dev/sdb). Same result. I then chose to not install a bootloader. Windows still works fine, and I assume Ubuntu has installed but is unbootable.\nKnowing that my computer could potentially brick itself again - and, this time around, with a lot of data to lose and hassle to go through if I mess it up - I really don't want to do anything without some advice. So I'll ask this:\n\n\n*\n\n*Why did the bootloader fail to install? Can I fix the error and install Ubuntu fresh?\n\n*Is there any way to get around the error, install the bootloader, and point it towards an existing installation of Ubuntu?\n\n*Is there a quicker and easier solution I might have missed?\n\n\n\nEDIT: Thanks for the tip, AthloX. After testing the liveCD in Virtualbox with no installation problems, I looked around for some alternate bootloaders but had no success.\nI attempted another install, which installed the bootloader and Ubuntu just fine but bricked Windows 7. I wiped both hard disks clean, including some \"System Reserved\" partitions I hadn't noticed before, before re-installing Windows 7 on one hard drive and immediately afterwards installing Ubuntu on the other.\nNow the computer boots into Windows, but I can pop into the BIOS at startup to boot into Ubuntu via it's bootloader, and I'm guessing it'll only take a bit of poking at the BIOS to swap the load order.\n\nA: I think its a problem with your Ubuntu Live CD. Try to download a new copy from here. Ubuntu also needs a swap area allocated not just free memory space. This document says why you need it.Swap.\n\nA: Check out if your ubuntu install cd is not corrupt. Possibilities of corrupt cd try it in virtualbox in win7 before going physical. If its working fine, then select the appropriate hard disk as you have two; to install the bootloader to their MBR sector, check the same hard disk is first booting in BIOS setting.\n", "Q: No space left on device while I still have 640GB of free space I was copying some huge files from a remote disk to my computer and got a message\n\nNo space left on device\n\nI installed my Ubuntu 12.04 in my 640GB HDD and thought that Ubuntu was utilizing all of its space but it seems not from this error message.\nI checked the space with 'disk usage analyzer' and the result says\n\nTotal filesystem capacity: 658.2 GB (used: 28.9GB available: 629.2GB)\n\nI checked again with 'disk utility'. And I found out that only 19GB is spared for the root and the rest is mounted at some place called /host.\nI installed Ubuntu in 640GB and hoped it would utilize the full disk space, but it looks like it some how occupied only about 20 GB of the 640GB HDD and left the rest of the space mounted at /host.\nHow can I resolve this problem? Could anybody give me a solution?\n\nA: You installed using the Windows Ubuntu Installer (Wubi). This means Ubuntu is not installed to your harddisk like a normal install, but instead uses a file in the Windows filesystem to simulate a harddisk. /host is your Windows host system, which contains that file. \nI would recommend that if you intend to keep using Ubuntu, you install it using a memory stick or CD/DVD directly onto your harddisk. You can also resize the harddisk image file manually and then resize Ubuntus filesystem, but this must be done from a live session in any case. It's probably both faster and easier to just install it using the normal (non-Windows) installer. Just copy your /home directory to some place else, and copy it back after the reinstall. That way, all your settings and files will still be available. \n", "Q: What are \"/run/lock\" and \"/run/shm\" used for? I just want to know where and how /run/lock and /run/shm can help our PC .\n$ df -h\nFilesystem            Size  Used Avail Use% Mounted on\n/dev/sda1              56G   13G   41G  24% /\nudev                  983M  4.0K  983M   1% /dev\ntmpfs                 396M  840K  395M   1% /run\nnone                  5.0M  8.0K  5.0M   1% /run/lock\nnone                  990M  164K  990M   0% /run/shm\n\n\nA: \nShort answer: they store temporary system files, including device locks and memory segments shared between different processes. Don't worry, they usually use a fraction of their \"size\" shown by df\n\n\n\n*\n\n*/run is, in general, a temporary filesystem (tmpfs) residing in RAM (aka \"ramdisk\"); its meant for storing \"temporary\" system or state files which may be critical but do not require persistence across reboots.\n\n\n*\n\n*/run is actually a fairly new innovation, and was added a couple of years ago to replace the multiple tmpfs's that used to be created (including /var/lock and /dev/shm) with a single unified root tmpfs.\n\n*The main locations /run replaces are:\n\n/var/run → /run\n/var/lock → /run/lock\n/dev/shm → /run/shm [currently only Debian plans to do this]\n/tmp → /run/tmp [optional; currently only Debian plans to offer this] \n\n\n*/run/lock (formerly /var/lock) contains lock files, i.e. files indicating that a shared device or other system resource is in use and containing the identity of the process (PID) using it; this allows other processes to properly coordinate access to the shared device.\n\n*/run/shm (formerly /dev/shm) is temporary world-writable shared-memory. Strictly speaking, it is intended as storage for programs using the POSIX Shared Memory API. It facilitates what is known as inter-process communication (IPC), where different processes can share and communicate via a common memory area, which in this case is usually a normal file that is stored on a \"ramdisk\". Of course, it can be and has been used in other creative ways as well ;)\n\n*Do not be alarmed about the size: importantly, many people running df -h and knowing that /run is backed by RAM are shocked that their precious memory is being \"wasted\" by these mysterious folders. Just like the Linux ate my RAM myth though, this belief is incorrect.\n\n\n*\n\n*The size shown is only the maximum that may be used\n\n*It defaults to 50% of physical RAM\n\n*Only as much shown in the Used column is actually in use, which in the above screenshot is less than 1 megabyte total\n\n*You can use the ipcs -m command to verify that the actual shared memory segments used match up to the df summary, and also see which PIDs are using them\n\n*Like your regular RAM, /run is also eventually backstopped by your swap, so if you are using /run/shm for \"faster\" compile times, keep that in mind ;)\n\n\n", "Q: How do I get these virtual domains working in Tomcat? im new to ubuntu and tomcat moving away from windows and iis to create a website on AWs.

I have a Samsung Galaxy s3 running the stock Samsung ROM and  I'm trying to transfer files - videos, photos, music and downloads, from my handset to my system via USB running Ubuntu 12.04.\nI have followed to links suggested \n\n\n*\n\n*How to connect MTP devices via USB?\nBut it all goes over my head. Can anyone help me with a simple GUI program or a link so I can simply copy and paste selected files from my phone onto my system? \n\nA: Alternatively, just buy micro USB cable (OTG) from ebay , original Samsung or 3rd party brands are available.  Using that cable you can connect external USB storage , external HDD and any external storage to your galaxy s3.  S3 will detect and u can transfer files or any media between  s3 to USB storage.\nYou don't need computer , just plug and play.  Or if u need to connect PC to your s3, you can use this cable or install KIES ( samsung's sync software ).\nNOTE: DO NOTE CONFUSE USB \"otg\" cable with micro USB cable comes with the Samsung device for charging and syncing . \n\nA: You can get file access to your phone's internal storage (/mnt/sdcard) or your external SD card (/mnt/extSdCard/) using gMTP as another replier @Easty noted (http://www.humans-enabled.com/2011/12/how-to-fix-samsung-galaxy-nexus-mtp.html).\nYou'll need to install libmtp (instruction are on that page and easily found elsewhere) and gMTP. \nOnce everything's installed do the following:\n\n\n*\n\n*Plug in your phone to the USB cable connected to your computer\n\n*Swipe down from the top and verify it's connected as \"a Media Device\" (MTP), if not click on the notification to change from Camera mode (PTP) to Media Device (MTP)\n\n*launch gmtp from your launcher (windows key then type 'gmtp')\n\n*When your phone connects (it may take some time) you may be prompted to connect to Phone or Card (drop-down menu) - pick the one you want to access, in this case 'Card'\n\n*Voila! You can browse the card, select files and download them to your computer with the Download button.\n\n\nIf you want to switch from browsing the SD card to the phone's memory simply click disconnect and then connect in gmtp and select 'Phone' instead of 'Card'.\nHope this helps, it certainly did for me!  Thanks @Easty!\n\nA: Try the following. This was tested on Galaxy SII, i am assuming it will work for SIII as well\n\n\n*\n\n*go to\nMenu -> Settings -> Wireless and network -> USB utilities \n\n*Click on Connect Storage to PC\n\n*Connect the USB cable to your pc.\n\n*Click on Connect USB storage\n\n*Use your file manager to install/copy/paste.\n\n*Once finished, click on Disconnect storage from PC to disconnect and unmount drive from Ubuntu.\n\n\nReference: http://www.tuxtrix.com/2011/07/how-to-access-samsung-galaxy-s-ii-usb.html\n\nA: I am currently running Ubuntu 12.10 and have a Sprint Samsung Galaxy S3 running Cyanogenmod.  I have yet to get MTP or PTP working successfully.\nHowever, I am able to very easily download and upload data (pictures, music, videos, files).  On my Android device, I simply run Dropbear SSH.  And then from my Ubuntu desktop, I use rsync to send and receive data.\n\nA: I had similar problem with my Galaxy S2. When I connected it to Ubuntu, it was never recognized. I use the following trick:\n\n\n*\n\n*On your android phone, go to Application->Settings \n\n*In there, go to Wirelessand Network and select USB Utilities\n\n*Click on Connect Storage to PC\n\n*A message should pop up: Connect USB cable to use mass storage\n\n*Now connect the USB cable to computer\n\n*A green android robot should be on display with an option of “Connect USB storage“, click on it\n\n*The green robot turns orange now and now you can access the files on the SD card of your phone\n\n\nSource: After I fixed, I wrote this on my blog: http://www.computerandyou.net/2012/01/how-to-fix-android-samsung-galaxy-s2-not-recognized-on-linux/\n\nAlternate:\nAlternatively, you can use gMTP. A GUI tool to use with MTP protocol. You may have trouble with libmtp. So better to install it before hand like this:\n\n\n*\n\n*Download MTP library libmtp from Sourceforge: http://sourceforge.net/projects/libmtp/files/libmtp/\n\n*use the following commands one by one to install it:\ncd Downloads\ntar xvzf libmtp-1.1.5.tar.gz\ncd libmtp-1.1.5\n./configure --prefix=/usr\nmake\nsudo make install\n\n\n*Now install gMTP:\nsudo apt-get install gmtp\n\n\n*Launch gMTP and connect your phone.\nSource: I wrote this detailed article with picture for my Kindle Fire connection problem with Ubuntu. It may come handy. \n\nA: Please first check that there is in fact a microsd card in your device.  I got a new device and sort of assumed that it had a microsd card, but it didn't.  Once I put in a microsd card, the instructions given by Easty worked.\n\nA: I have found the most practical solution in order to access files on Samsung galaxy s3 external SD card using Ubuntu 12.04 or later, and Nautilus file explorer\n\n\n*\n\n*The Samsung Galaxy S3 and the Ubuntu PC need to be at the same WiFi network/hotspot. Or you can use your Samsung Galaxy S3 as a USB modem to connect the Ubuntu PC (this is the faster file transfer solution).\nSamsung Galaxy s3 settings:\n\n*You have to buy DAVDRIVE at the Google play store $1.26\n\n*You have to change the DAVDRIVE: Settings > Filesystem > Filesystem Root > /\n\n*Run the DAVDRIVE app.\nUbuntu Settings:\n\n*Open Nautilus > File > Connect to Server\n\n*Set to WebDAV (HTTP), write the server IP address, port, user and password (given by the DAVDRIVE app)\n\n*When you have successfully open the server connection folder with Nautilus, go to:\nNautilus > WebDAV folder > Storage > extSdCard\nNote: If you don't need to access the extSdCard, you only need to install the DAVDRIVE lite free app version.\n\nA: I have found that the command line works very well for this, with a nifty tool from the Software Centre called adb (Android Debug Bridge).\nInstall with sudo apt-get install android-tools-adb or android-tools-adb:i386 \nPlug in the phone, do adb pull <remote> <local> to download files, or adb shell to navigate the phone directories and get to know where stuff is.\nAll the info you need is here: http://developer.android.com/tools/help/adb.html\n\nA: An easier solution (compared to compiling libmtp yourself) would be to install go-mtpfs. It includes the latest version of libmtp, and I can verify it works with my GS3 running CM 10. You can also install the go-mtpfs-unity package, which comes with a nice launcher icon and functionality. \nTo install, run\nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:webupd8team/unstable\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get install go-mtpfs-unity\n\nFull directions can be found here: http://www.webupd8.org/2012/12/how-to-mount-android-40-ubuntu-go-mtpfs.html\nThe easiest solution of all would be to use AirDroid, free on the Play Store. You just install the app on your phone, start it, and point any desktop web browser to the address it gives you. From there you can access the file system, upload/download photos and videos, even send SMS messages.\nI think the current version (in the Play Store) requires the phone and computer to be on the same WiFi network, but there's a v2 beta right now where this isn't necessary.\n\nA: Alternative Solution;\nI use ubuntu one for sharing files between my android device and my desktop. If you're over a wireless network this is the easiest way of transferring files between android devices and ubuntu. \nI have tried gmpt solutions at once but didn't have luck. This can be the last solution but it is working gently at least. \n\nA: I've updated my computer to 14.04 and with it, you just connect the USB cable between your Galaxy S3 and your computer. After having done it, a new window will pop up at center of your computer's screen asking for what to do on the telephone's folders. In other words, it mounts successfully.\nEverything works automatically. \nHope it helps. \n", "Q: Get client system information in LTSP I'm trying to get the system information of clients booted via LTSP to a Ubuntu 10.04 server. Any time I try any system info commands (example lspci | grep VGA) it returns back the server information, not the client.\nIs there a way to see the client information in LTSP? Local apps perhaps? Any help is appreciated.\n\nA: You can use a program called 'epoptes' and then reboot the clients. The clients will then show up in detected clients within the server side app and you can right client on each and go to 'Information' This will give you a summary of hardware on each client.\n", "Q: How to reinstall and completely wipe out Windows and the old install of Ubuntu? I installed Ubuntu and it kept windows but I lost things in both, so I downloaded Ubuntu again through different means and the install is going slow but it's doing better than the first install. \nI want to know if I can get rid of Windows and the old install of Ubuntu during this installation, so all I have on my computer is the new Ubuntu installation that is currently running?\n\nA: Select the option to use the entire disk during the installation. Beware that this will erase your entire harddisk! So please make 100% sure that you have backups of everything that you need, especially things like documents, pictures, music, etc. before you proceed.\nI would recommend using a separate partition for your home directory (or a separate disk as stated by the post below) because it makes backup and reinstall so much easier.\n\nA: Yes.  Like the previous poster mentioned, be sure you have backups of everything you want to keep as this will format the entire hard disk.  For this reason, I recommend running with two physical hard disks.  One is used for the operating system, and the other is used for all your personal files.  It's much easier to do things like installations, etc.\n", "Q: \"This computer currently has no detected operating systems\" when installing I am new to Ubuntu (AMD64) and am attempting to install it on my laptop which already has Windows 7 Home Premium x64. \nI currently have two partitions on my HDD and I was planning on repartitioning my secondary partition to make room for a third to use for Ubuntu.

TrueType has become the most common format for\nfonts on both the Mac OS and Microsoft Windows operating\nsystems.[citation needed]\nThe primary strength of TrueType was originally that it offered font\ndevelopers a high degree of control over precisely how their fonts are\ndisplayed, right down to particular pixels, at various font sizes.\nWith widely varying rendering technologies in use today, pixel-level\ncontrol is no longer certain in a TrueType font.\n\nLinux and other platforms\n\nThe FreeType project of David Turner attempts to create an independent\nimplementation of the TrueType standard (as well as other font\nstandards in FreeType 2). FreeType is included in many Linux\ndistributions.\nThere were potential patent infringements in FreeType 1 because parts\nof the TrueType hinting virtual machine were patented by Apple, a fact\nnot mentioned in the TrueType standards. (Patent holders who\ncontribute to standards published by a major standards body such as\nISO are required to disclose the scope of their patents, but TrueType\nwas not such a standard.) FreeType 2 includes an automatic hinter that\nanalyzes glyph shapes and attempts to generate hints automatically,\nthus avoiding the patented technology.3 The automatic hinter\ngenerally improves the appearance of free or cheap fonts, for which\nhinting is often either nonexistent or automatically generated, but it\ncan degrade the appearance of professional hand-hinted fonts, and does\nnot work well (or at all) for non-Western text that requires a\ndifferent approach to hinting. As a result, some users chose to enable\nthe patented hinting technology. As of May 2010, all patents related\nto bytecode hinting have expired worldwide, so FreeType 2.4 now enables these features >by default.\n\n\nIs this the same way on ubuntu?\nIn ubuntu you can install fonts by\n\n*\n\n*Open the folder where you have downloaded the font file.\n\n*Double click on the font file to open it. This opens a font viewer window.\n\n*On the right there is a button, \"Install Font\". Click on it.Wait until the button turns to greyed out \"Installed\".\n\nAre .ttf files standard to store fonts? Or is there another standard on linux?\nNo ,Gnu/linux  uses free types fonts as default , Ubuntu uses it is own font family  called ubuntu font family, Even then ubuntu supports other ttf fonts very well\n\nA: Yes, True Type fonts are a standard and are very well-supported in Ubuntu. Ubuntu also supports less common vector font standards such as OpenType (OTF), etc.\nIIRC, in Windows you usually right-click a font to Install it; double-clicking opens it in the Font Viewer. Ubuntu does the same -- open in Font Viewer, and click the Install button to install it:\n\n", "Q: Blank screen at login.

The former program cleverly masks your user agent and appears to apples's site as the itunes program and so is able to parse all the itunes urls; once installed, you can even click an itunes link in Firefox and it will open in TunesViewer.\nTunesViewer 1.5.2 can be downloaded from sourceforge and is a .deb file so is easily installed by double-clicking and selecting install in Software Centre; it has very few dependencies and is a much lighter-weight program than iTunes. You can set the location of your download folder from edit > preferences and then you should click the box to set TunesViewer as 'default opener', so any browser links will open in it. You download your podcasts by right clicking the files in the bottom tab of the program or the \"free\" link above, or you can just play them if you want with an external application such as rhythmbox, which it has  been tested with. \nThere are some great itunes U courses available (the first screenshot shows the one you want) and if you click the box in the far left hand corner of the program interface you can select to search for itunes U or regular itunes podcasts. You can of course manually copy an url into the program and load it up.\nTunesViewer is the only decent way to access the itunes U or podcast pages of apple.com on Linux without installing iTunes in wine. You don't need to know a link before hand and you can just start the program, and from the itunes U homepage, you can go to all the other itunes podcast pages. It's a great program that I use a lot!\n\n\n", "Q: How to play embedded flash videos in external players? As discussed in a separate question, embedded flash videos are abnormally heavy on GPU resources. \nThe answer given by izx here (and namely in one comment) shows that \n”Flash 11+ \"attempts\" (poorly, it looks like) to use the GPU (hardware) to \"decode\" the video instead of the CPU (software).\nDecoding is a fairly computationally intensive task, but most modern CPUs (except Atoms) will deal with 1080P HD without breaking a sweat.”.\n\nSo, it seems that a solution would be opening those videos in external players, even without downloading them, so as to put to work the CPU instead of the GPU.\n\nA: There is actually a pretty cool way to view all flash videos outside of your browser. But at the moment I only know it works on chrome and chromium. Before the page with the flash player loads press    ctrl+shift+J   This will open a tab at the bottom of the screen, it will have different tabbed options, one of them is NETWORK. You go into that one and open the flash video when it loads the link to the video will appear there all you have to do is copy it either to VLC or totem both of them play streams.\nI'm a huge VLC fan, but I gotta give it to TOTEm in this one it loads the videos a la flash if you leave it paused it will download the video VLC will not.\n\nA: As this question looks useful to me, I have created it in order to provide an answer. (The meta issue of doing this was discussed and answered (here and here).\n\nA specialized application to see Youtube videos in an external player is Youtube Viewer (youtube-viewer). It runs in terminal and uses mplayer or mpv to play the youtube video.\nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:nilarimogard/webupd8\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get install youtube-viewer\n\nMore here.\nBy default it uses mplayer. To make it use mpv instead, run youtube-viewer --video-player=mpv. So, a desktop file with this content may be useful:\n[Desktop Entry]\nExec=bash -c 'youtube-viewer --video-player=mpv'\nIcon=youtube-viewer\nName[en_US]=Youtube Viewer\nName=Youtube Viewer\nTerminal=true\nType=Application\n\nWhen running the program, a terminal window opens, saying:\n=>> Search for YouTube videos (:h for help)\n> ^J> \n\nJust type the search item. Then type the corresponding number(s) of the videos you want to be played.\n\n\nA cross-platform solution that is not limited to youtube is to use the well-known Firefox addon FlashGot, which is meant to send video streams to different download managers, but make it to send the URL stream to VLC (or mpv, which I prefer lately):\n\n\n*\n\n*add VLC to Flashgot list: FlashGot options, General tab, Add, give a name 'VLC' , - then go to the VLC executable and select it\n\n\n\n\n\n\n*\n\n*FlashGot options, FlashGot tab, choose VLC\n\n\n\n\n\n*\n\n*playing the video in Firefox, a Flashgot button should appear (add that to the toolbar or the status bar). Right-click the button, Available formats, and left-click the video. VLC should start playing the video stream\n\n\n\n\nSMPlayer. - limited to youtube (unless used with the solution above: have not tested that yet)\n \nand the Youtube Browser\n\nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:rvm/smplayer\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get install smplayer smtube\n\n\nIt starts the separate application, SMPlayer Youtube Browser, to search for videos. One can create a link/desktop launcher to it, \n\nor just run\n\nsmtube\n\nUsing VLC. It looks like VLC is able to start videos of this kind from more websites, while smplayer is limited to youtube.\n\nOne can add the link to the video in VLC \n\nUsing Totem:\n\nSome plugins are available for Totem player, among which a youtube browser similar to that of SMPlayer. You can open youtube videos in Totem, at lower quality it seems than in the previous options, but they load faster and are perfect for listening music from youtube.\n\nThere is also an arte-tv plugin for Totem that is not working at the moment... but maybe it will in the future... and supplementary plugins, including a BBC iPlayer. (The later no better than the one for arte-tv I fear.)\nBut I think that a more elegant method is using add-ons/extensions to open the external players directly from the internet browser's interface or context menu, like the aforementioned Flashgot addon. \nThe re is also the Firefox Openwith addon, created initially to open links in different web browsers, can do just that, by adding in its Preferences vlc and smtube  instead of/beside browsers .\n\n\nIn Chromium there is an extension to start youtubes in VLC - here.\nTo use it, the youtube video has to be playing, the VLC web interface has to be enabled  (VLC Tools-Preferences-Show Settings -All-Interface-Main-enable Web, restart VLC) and VLC has to be already open.\n\n\nWhile VLC seems able to do this outside youtube, it has limitations when dealing with other websites. In Dailymotion works perfectly, but on Google videos it already may have problems, in others it's the OpenWith addon that would not work. I hadn't time to test them enough, I'll update this post in time, and invite comments and edits that would help find ways to open any embedded flash in VLC or other external player.\n(This answer was based on ideas coming from izx, Halknner and user55822 as they answered or commented on other question.) \n\nThere is a VLC add-on to play YouTube videos and playlists - here\nCopy the URL of the youtube video or playlist (must contain \"list=PL...\")\nStart VLC, press Ctrl+N, paste the url then click on \"Play\" (or Alt+P then Enter), the video /playlist should start.\n\nIn 'Media', 'Save Playlist to File' and may open it later in VLC.\n\nA: Since some years, I'm usually grabbing flash files directly from the /proc directory, when they are here, in order to play them with VLC, which is by far the best tool around to watch videos.\nIt's not working with youtube, but it works great with most of the other Streaming website. I finally decided to make it more usable by writing some proper function to use within your shell. \nFeel free to try it, it works great:\n$ curl -SsL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/beaudev/view-da-flash/master/view_da_flash.sh>source\n\n$ view_daflash\n\nSource : https://github.com/beaudev/view-da-flash\n", "Q: Why can't I get Nova/OpenStack to use a specific host?

I have many files that i want to move into folders, their names are something like this dir1/dir2/dir3/name_of_file.ex and then maybe another is called /dir4/name_of_file2.xe\nIs there anyway of moving those files into the directory dir1/dir2/dir3 and change the name of it to only name_of_file.ex automatically?\nI really don't know how i can explain it easier.. but i have almost a 1000 files with names like TSData\\Res\\Catalog\\Scripts\\deckfoundations.txt and TSBin\\Sims2.exe and what i want to do with those files is to move into the folder TSData\\Res\\Catalog\\Scripts\\ and then rename the file to only deckfoundations.txt. don't know if you know PHP but there you have a explode function where you explode the name of the file with a character      \n$ar = end(explode(\"/\", $filename));\nprint_r($ar);\n\nwould output something like this\nArray\n(\n   [0] => TSData\\Res\\Catalog\\Scripts\n   [1] => deckfoundations.txt\n)\n\nThen with that i could use the first row to create the folder if not existing and then rename the full $filename to the second row of $ar\n\nA: You could try a file renaming tool such as those listed in the link provided by tachyons in the comments.\nIf that fails you may need to script something. \nAs you say in the question, you know PHP, why not write a solution yourself in PHP. What you suggest seems a reasonable approach.\n\nA: I have a script that I use to find, rename, and move files all in one go. You can modify it to suit your purpose if you want; it is currently set to randomly rename files, but you could set a pattern to rename them by. \nBy the way, the script moves all the files to the current working directory (the one it is executed in), but again that could be modified. You will obviously have to change the ~/Downloads location and substitute the .jpg extensions for what you need.\nI am not quite sure that this is exactly what you want, but it may be useful as a template for you and anyone else. Save it in your favourite text editor and make it executable. \nNOTE: if you modify the script, but keep the random renaming feature, be aware that occasionally there can be collisions (i.e. the same numbers are generated and the new file is overridden), as there are a limited number of new file names that even two instances of $RANDOM can generate. It is unlikely to happen as the files are being labelled with two sets of random numbers, but it might be better to have a different numbering system if your files are very important or critical in any way.\n#!/bin/bash\n# a script to recursively find all jpgs in a specified directory, rename with a random label and transfer to pwd\n\nfind ~/Downloads -type f -iname '*.jpg' -print0 | \nwhile IFS= read -r -d '' f; \ndo mv -- \"$f\" \"$RANDOM-$RANDOM.jpg\"; \n\ndone\n\n", "Q: Enable Intel graphics card on hybrid setup Because my Radeon HD 5400 card is getting too hot, I want to fall back on the Intel card. How  do I do this?\n\nA: HybridGraphics\nCheck here too How do I turn off the Radeon GPU ono my HP Pavilion DM4?\n\nA: Some computers have a hidden advanced BIOS configuration mode. On my HP dm4t this is accessed by pressing \"A\" immediately after or at the same time with \"F10\" (used to enter BIOS setup).\nDepending on the manufacturer and bios model and available updates it might be possible to change the GPU mode from Hybrid, to integrated GPU (iGPU), discrete GPU (dGPU). If this option is enabled (and working) in your case, it will turn of the card that is not selected and Ubuntu will work as if you have only one card.\nOn my HP dm4t only Hybrid and iGPU options work, dGPU will freeze the laptop when saving changes in BIOS.\n", "Q: Diagnosing persistent Flash streaming failure for DRM content I'm trying to implement the fixes from Adobe (as mentioned in this other question) but I'm having no success.\nI'm running 64-bit 12.04. When I try the Flash test as described on this Adobe guide:\n\n  \n*\n  \n*First, launch the Adobe demo video player container: http://drmtest2.adobe.com:8080/SVP/SampleVideoPlayer_FP.html  Note the Adobe Flash Player version in the lower left of the demo video shell.

From that test page, when I select the \"Show DRM Events\" checkbox I get \"Error #3344 [MissingAdobeCPModule]\", and then it just sits there and nothing plays.\nI've installed the HAL (several times) and cleared out the directories from my home .adobe directory as those instructions say, restarted Firefox, etc.\nThe Flash info page says \"You have version 11,2,202,160 installed\" and that 236 is the more up-to-date version, but I can't figure out how to install that. (I've tried, but to no avail; I just end up with 160).\nSo does anybody have ideas on what to do to make this work?\n\nA: I'd followed most of the advice I could find online, but ran across these extra steps to get the HAL working.  It comes from a post on Amazon's Prime Instant Video support thread:\nStephen Gutknecht says:\nOn a new (virgin) install of Ubuntu 13.04 x64/x32 - there are some steps that I don't see getting enough attention.\n\nIn addition to:\n\nclose your Chromium/Chrome and Firefox:\nsudo apt-get install libhal1 hal\n\n***also do***\n\nsudo mkdir /etc/hal/fdi/preprobe\nsudo mkdir /etc/hal/fdi/information\n/usr/sbin/hald --daemon=yes --verbose=yes\nrm -rf ~/.adobe\nrm -rf ~/.macromedia\n\nThen open Chromium / Firefox fresh and give it a try!\n\nThis is what I did and have DRM FLash videos working smoothly in Chrome on Ubuntu using the Adobe Flash plugin with HAL installed.\n\nA: OK well that was dumb. I had been installing (and re-installing) flashplugin-installer.  When I instead switched to adobe-flashplugin, that brought my version up to 236 (that is, 11,2,202,236) and it also made the test page work.\nSubsequently, a test at the NBC streaming site also worked.\nThus, it appears that in addition to doing the HAL stuff as described in the other question, it may also be necessary to be running the latest Flash version. For me, that required installing adobe-flashplugin instead of flashplugin-installer.\n", "Q: Installing audio libaries for pymedia I am building pymrdia from a tarball, but when i install i get:\nUsing UNIX configuration...\nOGG          : not found\nVORBIS       : not found\nFAAD         : not found\nMP3LAME      : not found\nVORBISENC    : not found\nALSA         : not found\nHow can I install these?\n\nA: Go here and write out the commands in a shell script if you know how, or just run the individually: https://kb.hivelocity.net/how-to-install-ffmpeg-ffmpeg-php-flvtool-lame-mplayer-libogg-libvorbis-and-mencoder/\n\nA: Try installing synaptic package manager\nsudo apt-get install synaptic\nThen just search for the packages eg.

If you're worried your laptop is too old to support newer Ubuntu releases you can install Lubuntu which is a lighter \"flavor\" of Ubuntu that should run well on old machines.\nIf you don't want to upgrade Ubuntu (but I recommend you do, as Ubuntu 10.04 is really old and unsupported now) you'll have to install backports (which was previously called compat-wireless and then compat-drivers), a software that brings drivers found in new kernels in older kernels.

That usually means you have something like a broadband modem/router, which is often NATed just to make things more interesting. In that case, it's the router that owns the public IP and you cannot change it in either Ubuntu, Windows or any other OS. \nYou should contact your internet service provider to get answers to this question. \n", "Q: How do I fix panic occurred error after installing dual-boot Ubuntu 12.04 alongside Win 7? I first attempted to install Ubuntu on my USB drive.  That worked just fine, but for reasons that weren't obvious to me then, it worked unbearably slow.\nSo I instead attempted to install Ubuntu alongside my Win 7 install.  I used the \"install alongside...\" option, and it seemed to work well until the reboot occurred, and my computer would automatically load Windows.  Grub just didn't want to start.  Keep in mind I allocated 20GB to Ubuntu during this attempt, and I didn't have my internet connected.\nI cleared the Ubuntu partition and joined it back to the partition that holds Win 7 (by extending the Win 7 partition), and simply attempted another install.  I followed the same steps as last time, only I allocated 50GB to Ubuntu, and I had my internet connected.  The install took all night long.  I had to leave my system on overnight and cross my fingers that it would work.  It especially took forever when downloading language packages.\nNow Grub loads.  It gives me a number of options (I don't have the Grub screen in front of me so please forgive me for paraphrasing the options):\n1. Boot Linux on Ubuntu normally.\n2. Boot Linux on Ubuntu in recovery mode.\n3. Run CheckDisk.\n4. Another option that involves CheckDisk.\n5. Boot Windows 7 on sda1.\n6. Boot Windows 7 on sda2.\nWhenever I choose option 1, I get a terminal screen that flashes a bunch of processes on the screen and ends with \"panic occurred. rebooting in 30 seconds.\"  This happens every time.\nI chose option 2, and within recovery mode I attempted to repair.  The repair process attempted to download files and each attempt failed.  I then attempted to enable networking within recovery mode, and it just flashed a bunch of processes and, without saying panic occurred, said \"rebooting in 30 seconds\" and rebooted.\nI haven't tried either CheckDisk or MemCheck options (now that I think of it I think it does say MemCheck instead of CheckDisk).\nChoosing option 5 boots Windows 7 normally with no problems (so far).\nChoosing option 6 starts Windows 7, but then reboots my computer.\nIs there any way I can repair Ubuntu without having to wipe its partition and start again from scratch?

I am so much confused. I had already submit my laptop for HDD change(valid warranty), but they refused to change it and they said there are no bad sectors(They used windows's tools). But HDD performance is poor. \nSystem specification: \nCPU: DualCore E-450 AMD APU\nRAM: 2GB\nHDD: Toshiba 320 GB\nLaptop model: Acer aspire 4250\n\nThere should be any way that we can prevent SATA controller to reallocate bad blocks. Then we can find out the bad blocks and mark unused by fsck. After that enable reallocation again. So ubuntu will not call for bad sectors and reallocation will be zero and also it reduce the rate of new bad sectors.\n\nA: I agree with StarNamer's comment. The bad blocks are substituted by the firmware on the drive, so ideally the operating system doesn't know about the bad blocks (except through S.M.A.R.T.) The number of reallocated sectors does seem high to me for a disk as young as yours.\nDisk throughput depends upon the size of the data reads and writes and its location on disk.\nYou may wish to Run the self-test in the main window above to see how it does.\nIt may be prudent to find tools that access S.M.A.R.T. under Windows and quote its findings should you resume the conversation with your vendor. That will show the remapped sectors. The S.M.A.R.T. data is information from the disk controller and therefore will be the same for Ubuntu and Windows.\n", "Q: Responding very slow while loading icons I have just installed Xubuntu 12.04 x32 from a USB on to my hard drive.

I loaded dconf-editor. There is no menu, but I did discover that you can press Ctrl+F and enter a search term.\nHowever, I do not know what Ctrl+F actually searches. When I enter a term (e.g. panel or unity-greeter), I receive no results.\nI have also tried gsettings at the command line, but with no luck whatever options I have tried; I must be doing it incorrectly.\nHow do I search for a specific key or value within dconf?\n\nA: First, the search function in dconf-editor searches only among those things which are directly visible on screen or reachable by scrolling (note that the search field looks just like the one in other applications like Nautilus).\nI know of no other graphical tool you could use. So you probably need to use the command line tool dconf (also from the package dconf-tools).\nSpecifically for search recursively through the whole database (including keys and values) I would use this command:\ndconf dump / | grep SEARCH-TERM\n\ndump basically gives you the whole database in an \"Windows-Ini-File\"-like format. For browsing through the database, use dconf list /PATH.\nAs you've mentioned gsettings, the equivalent search command there is:\ngsettings list-recursively | grep SEARCH-TERM\n\nHowever, this may not be what you want (for a search for unity, this gives completely different results for me). Not sure what database is used here.\nEdit: After reading this question, I noticed that dconf shows you only the settings which are actually set in the database, not all possible settings like dconf-editor. Apparently you can use gsettings list-schemas to give you all possible settings.\n\nA: dconf read <KEY>\n\nFor example, to read the current wallpaper picture filename:\ndconf read /org/mate/desktop/background/picture-filename\n\nFor a list of keys\n    dconf dump / > dconf.dump\nYou can then examine the text file dconf.dump for the key you want to query.

You should figure out firstly whether it's a problem with Disk Utility or just the disk. Your best bet is to try burning a second disk and see what happens when you boot.\nAlso, instead of booting from the CD via the C button, try holding down the option key instead to see a menu of bootable devices to select the disk from there.\n\nA: Jdonner is right, I have had the same problem and normally its just a bad disk.  To minimize the chance of errors you can also burn your disk at a slower speed. On my Mac, I can do it at 24x or 8x.

If you disable the proposed selection in the software sources and then run the install commands it should then give you the option of installing unity-revamped\nOpen the Software Center and in the Edit menu select software sources then click on the updates tab....\n \nRemove the check from the Proposed box.\nThen in a terminal run \nsudo apt-get update\nAfter the update is completed try to run\nsudo apt-get dist-upgrade again and it should show you that unity 5.12.0-0ubuntu3 is available.\nJust a note, it is safer to not select the Proposed updates unless you need some program that is not available in the current release.  The Proposed selection will install as updates all the newest programs, but they are the programs that are still in the testing phase so they can have some bugs still.  Once the programs that are in the Proposed section have been fully tested, they will be moved to the Updates section and be available as a stable package.\nThe untiy-revamped ppa lags behind the release a little bit, I believe that it was about a week the last time but he seems to do a good job of keeping it updated(as far as I can tell anyway, this ppa has only been running a short time) \nAs an aside, I have been running unity-revamped and have had very few problems with it, the dodge windows feature occasionally sticks and will not hide the launcher but it is fixed by logging out and back in.  This only happens once in a great while and everything else works fine while it is stuck....\n\nEdit:  the above mentioned version of unity (5.14.0-0ubuntu1) is currently the recent version of unity so 5.14.0-0ubuntu1+ikarosdev2 should install correctly (as of Sept 2012) but this answer will still work if you have the proposed repository selected and are getting a similar error but with different version numbers.  i.e. this will occur any time a new version of Unity is installed from the proposed section but the unity-revamped ppa has not bee updated to the newest \"proposed\" version.\n\nA: Replace sudo apt-get upgrade with sudo apt-get dist-upgrade\nsudo apt-get upgrade updates installed packages and never installs new packages.\nsudo apt-get dist-upgrade updates installed packages, and may install new packages along the way.\n", "Q: MySql - unable to connect as root I have need to connect to mySql server 5.5 and create database using command line. Ideally it would be using a UI utility but I don't have it.  Here is an issue:\nalex@ubuntu:~$ sudo mysql -u root\nERROR 1045 (28000): Access denied for user 'root'@'localhost' (using password: NO)\n\nHowever I definitely set password while I was installing MySql server.\nWhat should I do to solve it?\n\nA: Connect with sudo mysql -u root -p and it will prompt you for the password. The key here is the -p option. You can also provide the password as part of the command with the -p option, but that is considered a security risk, since the password will be stored in clear text in your commands history.\n\nA: Also; if you need a GUI, you may use either Webmin available from http://www.webmin.com/ or MySQL workbench available at http://www.mysql.com/\n", "Q: Dual boot installation I would like to install Ubuntu on a seperate harddrive to my Windows file system.\nI have a harddrive installed in the computer that shall be used solely for a Linux system.\nI thought I'd try to install with the Windows installer, but it can't see the Linux harddrive - probably because it's already had Linux on it before and Windows refuses to recognize it.\nAlthough, Windows CAN see the harddrive in the device manager, it's not showing in \"My Computer\".\nDo I have to download the full install CD, or is there a workaround for this so I can still use the Windows installer?\n\nA: I'd download the installer and use that to install to the drive - even if you use Wubi it will have to download what it needs anyway - so you'll not save much in the way fo bandwidth.\nIf you get it with a torrent then you will be sure the iso you get is good.\nhttp://www.ubuntu.com/download/desktop/alternative-downloads\nhttps://help.ubuntu.com/community/GraphicalInstall\n\nA: Your best bet would be to install from the Live CD instead of WUBI. This way you will have the cleanest installation, and the best performance from Ubuntu. If you insist on installing from within WUBI, I 'm sure Windows can format a hard drive that was previously formatted with a Linux filesystem, probably through Administrative Tools -> Disk Management or something similar.\n", "Q: Xorg: Number of created screens does not match number of detected devices I've been trying to configure my TV as external monitor, because the only thing I saw on it was a white background with a X as cursor.\nI tried around in the nVidia XServer Settings, but I never got it working that it would disable the laptop monitor and move to my TV as soon as I'd plug in the HDMI cable. After not beeing able to get it to work, I tought I'd rename xorg.conf so it would create a default configuration again (at least I tought it would).\nAfter a restart, I got the login screen.

While using gdm I am able to login. As soon as I change it back to lightdm, I can't log in anymore. Any idea?\n\nA: Ok, for some reason, deleting the .Xauthority file did the trick (I can't find the thread again which said that, but it was here on askubuntu.com), and I was able to log in again. Unfortunately I already did remove and reinstall so many different components, that I had some strange behaviours (for example new system sounds), that I decided to reinstall.\nEdit: This was the thread.\n", "Q: How much space does Ubuntu take up after it's already installed? I know how much space is required to install Ubuntu.\nHow much space does a Ubuntu installation take up on the disk?\n\nA: Update (September 2019)\nA Minimal installation of Ubuntu 19.04 Desktop (64-bit) uses 3405M on / plus 86M on /boot according to df -BM.  This is after I disabled and deleted the 2033M file /swapfile.  Additionally, apt-get autoremove can lower disk usage on / to 3331M.\nUpdate (April 2018)\nA Minimal installation of Ubuntu 18.04 Desktop (64-bit) uses 4195M on / plus 76M on /boot according to df -BM.  It is possible that more space is required during the installation itself, as a Minimal installation may start with a Normal installation and then remove a predefined set of packages.\nUnfortunately, after (1) performing a Minimal installation, (2) rebooting and (3) logging in via the graphical login screen, all I get is (4) a mouse cursor.  No menus, no icons, no ability to run any programs, and no ability to log out.\nA Normal installation of Ubuntu 18.04 Desktop (64-bit) uses 4732M on / plus 76M on /boot according to df -BM.\nUnfortunately, even with a Normal installation, I still do not get a working graphical desktop.  My laptop is an Acer Aspire One with 2GB of RAM.  The live ISO of 18.04 runs acceptably.\nAdditional update:  If you have no swap partition, Ubuntu 18.04 seems to create a swap file at /swapfile.  In my case, the files was about 1GB, but I don't know how much of it was actually used.  It is possibly that the unused portion of the swap file would not be included in df.  After I turned off swap, removed it from /etc/fstab, and deleted the swapfile, disk usage dropped to around 4000MB on the Standard installation.\nThe GNOME desktop did finally appear.  It took about 10 minutes, maybe more.  So I'm going to try installing Ubuntu-MATE instead.  I'm not attached to any particular default desktop.  I generally run the Openbox window manager without any desktop environment.\nUbuntu-MATE 18.04\nWith /swapfile: 5679M on /, 76M on /boot\nWithout /swapfile:  4732M on /, 76M on /boot.  \nOriginal Answer (December 2016)\nI just installed Ubuntu 16.04.1 Desktop (64-bit) on to an 8GB USB stick.\nUpon booting immediately after the install, df -BM / says I have used 3418M (or under 3.5GB) of disk space.\nIt is possible that more space than that was temporarily used during the installation process.  The system has no swap.  I was not connected to a network during the install.\nAnnoyingly, the Ubuntu installer said that 8.5GB of space was required, and refused to install on my 8GB USB stick.  I bypassed this requirement by temporarily inserting a 32GB USB stick.\nOf course, depending upon what additional software you want to install, and what type of work you want to do on the system, you could need significantly more than the 3.5GB that is used, or even significantly more than the 8.5GB that the installer claims is \"required\".\nI typically install Ubuntu onto 20GB root partitions, and store all my work data on separate partitions and disks.\n\nA: I create separate partition usually 20-30GB for system(at least 10GB!). Later I create /home/xxx partition for left free disk space and I use it as my home directory. Under partitioning and installation I mount my partition as home folder. This allow you very easily to re-install whole Ubuntu without loosing your data & settings.\n\nA: I have a VirtualBox running 12.04 LTS 64-bit Desktop that takes up 7.5G\nwith full graphics, SW-dev, HTTP, SSH, LibreOffice\n\nA: According to installation procedure 4.5 GB approximately for Desktop Edition . It varies for Server edition and net-install .\n\nPlease refer this System Requirements for more info.\nNote : On a fresh install of Ubuntu 12.04 - 64 bits without any Graphic or Wifi drivers took approximately 3~ GB of File system space.  And i guess 4.5 GB is recommended for Updating packages , Language packs , etc  and best practical reason is for Ease and  Smooth Usage of System avoiding Low memory kind of situations.\n\nA: I have installed ubuntu on a tablet pc (acer w700). According to system properties, it takes up 4.7 GB after updates. So it is far to say it is much more leaner and smaller than say windows.\n", "Q: Skype only logs in as root I just installed Skype on my Ubuntu 12.04 again and somehow I can only login if I start Skype via root (sudo skype) in the terminal. If I try otherwise via dash or just \"skype\" without sudo permission I can't log in, it says \"Login failed\" or \"Sign in failed\" (got the German version).\n\nA: Run the following command:\nsudo chown -R $USER: ~/.Skype\n\nThe command will give back ownership on all of Skype's config files to your own user, as you've probably ran Skype with sudo once. Which, after that, root took ownership of some of the files in its config and history files.\nIf you don't need your Skype logs, you can also remove the ~/.Skype directory (renaming would be safer).\nmv ~/.Skype ~/.Skype.bak\n\n\nA: Run this command it's Working for you: curl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nu11secur1ty/Kali-Linux-skype/master/fix.sh | bash\n", "Q: APT downloading without my consent I installed natty (11.04) and wanted to play a video.\nWent through the process the cancelled because it was slow and files were relatively large unstable and it was late .(Internet very expensive for me).\nI copied the links to download later.\ni closed mplayer and went on surfing in Firefox.

Also can you install Ubuntu directly on your hard drive? please help! \n\nA: The standard desktop CD install image is just under 700 MB, the DVD image is at most 1.6 GB. A standard 700 MB or higher blank CD or any blank DVD will do (you can also use a USB thumb drive).\nYou'll need to boot from your chosen install media (CD, DVD or USB drive) to install.\nIf you haven't already read the official instructions I would highly recommend you do so.\n", "Q: Grub shell greets me at boot-up, instead of a menu After a fresh install of 10.04, trying to boot yields grub> prompt.

The BIOS sees the Grub installation but the Grub installation isn't looking for the kernel in the right place.  I'd change the drive the motherboard thinks its booting from.  \nOnce you get in, whether using this install or a  live disc, make sure disk drive references in /etc/fstab use UUIDs.

I'm using it to sync my android phone and ubuntu calendars every day. It's the best calendar application on linux I've been able to find so far.\nIf you want to synchronize calendars offline, as I suppose judging from your question, then you can e.g. download your calendar file as ics-file and import it to Rainlendar as well.\n\nA: In Gnome Online Accounts add the same google account that you use on your android device.\n", "Q: Laptop battery only changes to 29% I have a Dell Latitude e6400 laptop and recently installed Ubuntu 12.04.

I recently installed ubuntu 12.04 with grub. But now I have decided that I don't like ubuntu and I want windows 7 back. How can I get it back? I don't have a windows 7 disc because windows 7 was pre installed on my laptop. So how can I get windows 7 back?\n\nA: *\n\n*If Windows was pre-installed, you should have a recovery partition on the hard disk to let you reinstall Windows; there's typically a way to start the recovery progress upon booting the computer, please see your manual. \n\n*However, if you chose \"Use entire disk\" when installing Ubuntu, the recovery partition may have been deleted. Unfortunately, you will then probably have  to contact your manufacturer for a set of recovery disks OR send the laptop in for service so they can reinstall Windows 7 for you. \n\n*Finally, if you are fairly computer-savvy and can find and install Windows drivers, etc. and other things that are normally preinstalled, you can install Windows by legally downloading and burning the ISO for your edition, using the key from the sticker on the bottom of your computer. Note that you will have to call Micosoft within 30 days to activate Windows though--if you tell them you didn't like Ubuntu and love Windows they will be happy to allow you to do it ;)\n\nA: (Assuming Windows 7 is on the first bootable partition of your boot disk.) You should be able boot Windows from grub and then reinstall the Microsoft MBR using Windows.\nThis will stop Grub from running in the future. The Microsoft MBR will transfer to the first bootable partition on your boot disk whenever you boot.\nOf course you can also keep grub and simply tell it to boot Windows whenever you boot, but I'm assuming the above is what you have in mind.\n\nA: You probably need to contact you computer's brand or retail shop for a new installation disk. \nSome computers come with hidden recovery partitions that allow you to restore you computer's software, but you should be able to see them using the Disk Utility inside Ubuntu, if Disk Utility does not show you anything else besides your Ubuntu partitions then you need to get a installation disk and re-install your system.\n", "Q: How to change keyboard layout?

I use filezilla so as to access my project's web space at sourceforge.\nThere is no firewall blocking anything because I can successfully login using the 'sftp' command via a terminal, but I want to use Filezilla, because it is much easier this way to manage your files.\nFilezilla used to work fine when I used 11.10, now, when I open Filezilla and fill in the following things:\nHost: web.sourceforge.net\nUsername: Username\nPassword: Password\nPort: 21\n\nAnd, when I click on the Quickconnect button on the right I immediately get this message:\nStatus: Resolving address of web.sourceforge.net\nStatus: Connecting to 216.34.181.70:21...\nStatus: Connection attempt failed with \"ECONNREFUSED - Connection refused by server\".\nError:  Could not connect to server\nStatus: Waiting to retry...\n\nWhen  I go to Edit->Network configuration wizard...

There really is nothing listening on port 21, hence the ECONNECT error (nothing to do with the external IP).\nYou need to prefix the URL in QuickConnect with sftp://, i.e. sftp://web.sourceforge.net, and everything works great:\n\n", "Q: PowerBook G4 (3,5) airport drivers I'm looking for the airport drivers for my Powerbook G4 model 3,5 (link) Where can i find those?\n\nA: Broadcom, that makes the wifi chipset for the airport, only releases x86 non-free drivers for linux. So getting the wifi to work is unlikely. Broadcom supposedly is now producing an open source driver but I think the hardware it supports is limited to new hardware. (it is also only in kernels newer than Precise)\n", "Q: Why does cfdisk give me an \"Unsupported GPT\" error? \nNumber  Start (sector)    End (sector)  Size       Code  Name\n   1            2048          409599   199.0 MiB   0700  Microsoft basic data\n   2          409600       608667647   290.0 GiB   0700  Microsoft basic data\n   3       608667648       616859647   3.9 GiB     8200  Linux swap\n   5      1026465792      1250263039   106.7 GiB   0700  Microsoft basic data\n   6       616863744       770463743   73.2 GiB    8300  Linux filesystem\n   7       770463744       771078143   300.0 MiB   EF02  Linux filesystem\n   8       924067840      1026463743   48.8 GiB    8300  Linux filesystem\n   9       771078144       924067839   73.0 GiB    8300  Linux filesystem\n\nIs what gdisk says my computer looks like (well /dev/sda, but you know.)

Anyway any idea as to how to stop this without completely reformatting my hard drive b/c I don't like gdisk that much.\n\nA: You appear to have a GPT partition table and cfdisk will NOT work with those (only MBR supported). Please use cgdisk instead :)\nNormal usage of cgdisk on GPT hard disks\nJust start it as sudo cgdisk, and you can interactively perform operations. If you have a desktop or X installed, a GUI alternative such as gparted may be preferable.\n\n", "Q: How do I limit the workspaces borders? Ubuntu 12.04 allows to move a window from a workspace to another using the mouse, but once in a while, that feature is very inconvenient because when the active window detaches from the top bar, it slips to the upper border and the top part of the window goes to the bottom workspace, which makes me change workspace in order grab it to the current workspace. \nSo basically I just need, under certain circumstances, to treat every workspace independently, with locked borders, instead of having a giant workspace divided into four sections.\nIs there any way to accomplish this??\n\nA: Well, I'm using Ubuntu 10.04 (still cannot stand Unity) but I think this will still work . . .\nAre you aware that you can move the active window from one workspace to another by holding:\nCtrl + Alt + Shift + {cursor key for direction of desired workspace}\nFor instance, if you're in the left workspace and you want to move the current active window into the workspace on the right you just hold Ctrl+Alt+Shift+Right.\nAnd you can jump your view from one workspace to another by holding\nCtrl + Alt + {cursor key for direction of desired workspace}\n\nA: You don't need to switch to the other workspace to recover your window. Because you don't need the title bar to drag a window in Ubuntu. With the Alt key pressed, you can click anywhere on the window to drag it.\n", "Q: How do you emulate a Bluetooth keyboard? Well I'm using Ubuntu 12.04 on a Samsung R410 (newer version!) and I have many bluetooth enabled devices with horrible virtual keyboards, and I would like to connect them to bluetooth keyboards, but I don't have any so can't I use the keyboard on my laptop to control these devices? By the way my computer's bluetooth dongle is capable of such a thing. Thanks in advance!\n\nA: The bluetooth keyboard emulation is handled by the client (your phone), not the server (Ubuntu). You need to find a bluetooth keyboard app designed to be compatible with Linux on your smartphone for a proper bluetooth keyboard experience.\n", "Q: Should both Alsa and Pulseaudio be Installed? I'm confused about Alsa and Pulseaudio. Should both be installed on my system at the same time? Do they conflict?\nIf so, which one is better to have?\n\nA: *\n\n*PulseAudio is a sound server (also does mixing, processing, etc.)\n\n*It does not directly interface with the hardware (sound card). In fact, it usually uses ALSA to talk to the sound card.\n\n*So it's normal for components of both PulseAudio and ALSA to be installed at the same time, and this is the default in Ubuntu. With the default installation, no, they do not conflict.\n\n*In general, PulseAudio is preferable to using ALSA to provide the \"sound server\" (software-level sound support); however, professional audio users often prefer using JACK instead of PulseAudio for lower latencies.\n\nRelated Information: The Wikipedia PulseAudio page may be helpful.\n\n", "Q: Missing general fonts after installing WINE I have problem with my font after installing flash & wine, font as Arial, Verdana, Comic SanMS, Times New Roman, Tahoma, etc not found on my system. how to install it?\n\nA: You need to install ttf-mscorefonts-installer available from the Ubuntu Software \nCentre:\n\nor (using the terminal Ctrl-Alt-T)\n\nsudo apt-get install msttcorefonts\n\nPlease review this question to understand why Flash needs these common Microsoft true type fonts to work properly\n", "Q: Compile latest blender on ubuntu 12.0464bit?

You used to be able to patch the panel code so it becomes properly transparent, though it will not work anymore for GNOME 3.\n", "Q: How can I make my system usable after modifying /usr/share/icons's permissions? I'm running a duel boot/partition machine with Ubuntu 12.04 and Windows 7. On Ubuntu OS, I wanted to change the permissions in one of my directories so could extract files into that directory. In the terminal I entered chmod -R 777 /usr/share/icons which gives the owner, group, global read, write, and execute permissions. After I extracted the files into the directory, in the terminal I then entered chmod -R 644 /usr/share/icons which I believe gives the owner read and write permissions but the group and global read-only permissions. This was a mistake.\nAfter I entered this command, the entire system froze and some of the icons were missing. I restarted the computer and logged back in but it gave the same problem. The Linux system has become inoperable.\nI'm currently on my Windows 7 OS. Does anyone know how to fix this?\n\nA: Well, boot from Ubuntu LiveCD, open terminal and run commands:\n cd /usr/share/icons\n sudo find -type d chmod +x '{}' ';'\n\nThis will add 'executable' bit for directories (and you will be able to get listings of that directories).\n", "Q: USB FastE or GigE that \"just works\" with Linux 2.6 kernels I am trying to find a USB FastEthernet or GigabitEthernet that works without recompiling Debian Squeeze or Ubuntu Oneric.\nSo far, I have tried the following USB GigE adapters:\n\n\n*\n\n*Belkin F4U047-RS\n\n*Sabrent USB-NT20\n\n*Linksys USB300M\n\n*Apple MC704ZM/A\n\n\nWhen I inserted them in a Debian Squeeze machine, all of them would show up as an interface in dmesg; however, I could never get them to actually link up with an ethernet switch. I was using a cable that was known-good, and I was using an ethernet port that worked with the on-board GigE jack. \nI know I can recompile and get the Linksys USB300M working; however, I have to get interfaces up quickly for any random linux server in our lab (which are mostly Debian / Ubuntu).\nThroughput is really a low priority for these, the need is mostly just basic network connectivity when I fire up a new motherboard, and the on-board GigE isn't recognised for whatever reason; other times, I may need a spare interface for a quick firewalling project.\n\nA: Fast Ethernet USB adapters are widely available and should be for a couple of years at least. For example, the majority of USB network adapters at Newegg.com are still Fast Ethernet :-)\nAmong those, I would highly recommend the D-Link DUB-E100 as something I have personally used and that works out-of-the-box; it has in-kernel drivers. I see that it now comes in two revisions, A and B, but the internal chipset should be identical.\nFrom the official Linux-USB page, the module is usbnet and the supported chipset is the ASIX AX88172. Alternative adapters mentioned there include the Hawking UF200 and Netgear FA120.\n", "Q: OpenGL games won't open due to X11 For some reason, any OpenGL game I try to play crashes when it wants to open the window.

Linux is very respectful about RAM memory usage and besides you can always create a swap partition, so in the end it comes down to the processing power of your PC. If you have at least a dual-core, Ubuntu will work just fine, as long as you don't open too much applications or webpages filled with flash advertisements and banners at same time and as other people said, change to Unity 2D. If you want to be really sure to have a system running smoothly, I strongly recommend Lubuntu, based on Ubuntu 12.04 with lightweight LXDE interface, however it is not LTS (Long term Support), meaning that it will not be supported when 12.10 version arrives. Try Ubuntu first in a Live-USB environment and then check if your system runs fine with it.\n\nA: Yes, but will be a little slow.\nThere are many solutions to speed up the system, though:\n\n\n*\n\n*Make sure to create a big (like 4GB) swap partition (during the installation process).\n\n*Switch to Ubuntu 2D (technically, unity-2d). You can find this options by clicking on the Ubuntu logo beside your name in the login screen. (in case you don't get a login screen when you turn the PC on, try to \"log out\" from the desktop, change that option, and login again.)\n\n*Try to not keep different applications open at the same time. Finish your work with one, close it down, and get to another one. (of course you will need a few applications always open, like a browser)\n\n\nThat's all comes to my mind right now.\n\nA: I run 12.04 on a laptop with only 1GB ram and it runs okay. I had to use Unity2d because Unity3d was really sluggish. Using another window manager other than Unity would probably make it snappier.\n", "Q: How do I install the Command Line Interface?

Until I install the driver, my resolution will be stuck at 640x480, so please, someone help. What am I doing wrong?\n\nA: Please go to System Settings -> Additional Drivers to install your driver. If no driver is listed there, chances are there is no proprietary Nvidia available for your version of Ubuntu.\n\nA: The community documentation provides a guide on how to install the Nvidia drivers from the website, but it's not recommended as it is extremely advanced like you said.\nUsually if a matching card is found, the drivers will be available for installation, which is the safest way, but you can also force to install the necessary packages and configure them manually, again this is more advanced and not recommended.\n", "Q: How do I to create a live-USB with Unity 2D by default? I want to create a bootable Live-USB to be able to run Ubuntu on any machine I need, independently of its hardware specs.

Get Ubuntu Builder and your source ISO\nUbuntu Builder automates many of the preliminary steps that had to be done by hand (mount ISO, extract squashfs, create chroot, etc.)  It gives you Synaptic and a \"graphical\" chroot as well (Unity UI).\nDownload the latest version deb from here, and install with Software Centre or dpkg -i.\nAlso download the Ubuntu Desktop ISO you're planning to work with.\n2. Ubuntu Builder Basics\n\n*\n\n*Start Ubuntu Builder from the Launcher. I recommend you set all three fields to \"Ubuntu\" (like the actual LiveCD), because setting custom fields led to Software Center crashing. When you install, you can choose your own username, machine name, etc. as always.\n\n\n\n*Load your ISO; I loaded the 64-bit with the Local Disk option, although Ubuntu Builder should be able to download the ISO if you want it to.\n\n\n*The buttons on the right are self-explanatory. Console gives you a CLI chroot, while Desktop gives you a graphical one!, i.e. a LiveCD session itself (this one may take a while to load). Note that the Select DE/WM does an incomplete job sometimes, so it's better to install via apt-get/Synaptic.\n3.

If I type L in the dash, it is nowhere to be found.  EVEN if I just launched LÖVE from the launcher, it does not show up in the \"recent apps\" section of the dash.\nIs there an issue with apps with special character/the dash??\n\nA: The Dash will search through your .desktop files and use the name provided and comments so that you don't have to enter \"Firefox\", for instance. Entering \"web\" will do just as fine, since \"web\" is part of the description of Firefox. \nIn the case of LÖVE, the application developer has specifically asked that the application should not show up in menus by specifying NoDisplay=True in the desktop file. I don't know exactly why they've done this, but it might be because it requires a filename input in order to do anything useful. \nIf you think this should be different, you can file a bug with the LÖVE developers by pressing Alt+F2 and enter ubuntu-bug love. \n", "Q: Where can I find the right printer driver for my Epson Stylus Photo 1400?

How could I know if there's a keylogger in my system, or at least if one is active right now?\n\nA: Is a keylogger running right now?\n\n*\n\n*First, we'll assume you're using a stock Ubuntu system that X installed and that has always been under X's control -- where X is yourself or someone you absolutely trust.\n\n\n*Since this is a stock system and all software has been installed from the official repositories, you can be certain that there is no hidden keylogger in there, e.g. someone modifies the kernel specially to spy on you such that it is very hard to detect.\n\n\n*Then, if a keylogger is running, its process(es) will be visible. All you need to do is use ps -aux, or htop to look at the list of all running processes and figure out if anything is suspicious.\n\n*\n\n*The most common \"legitimate\" Linux keyloggers are lkl, uberkey, THC-vlogger, PyKeylogger, logkeys. logkeys is the only one available in the Ubuntu repositories.\n\n\n\nDid I accidentally download a trojan/virus keylogger?\n\n*\n\n*Usually this risk is very minimal on Ubuntu/Linux because of the privileges (su) required.\n\n*You can try using a \"rootkit\" detector as Mitch noted in his answer.\n\n*Otherwise, it comes down to forensic analysis, such as tracing/debugging processes, looking at file modifications/timestamps between boots, sniffing network activity, etc.\n\nWhat if I'm on an \"untrusted\" Ubuntu system?\nSo what if you're in an internet/cybercafe, at the library, at work, etc.? Or even a home computer used by many family members?\nWell, all bets are off in that case. It's fairly easy to spy on your keystrokes if someone has enough skill/money/determination:\n\n*\n\n*Those kernel-modifying hidden keyloggers that are so nearly impossible to introduce into someone else's system are much easier to introduce when you're the administrator of a public computer lab and are putting them on your own systems.\n\n*There are hardware USB or PS/2 keyloggers that sit between the keyboard and the computer, logging each keystroke into built-in memory; they can be hidden inside the keyboard, or even inside the computer case.\n\n*Cameras can be positioned so that your keystrokes are visible or can be figured out.\n\n*If all else fails, a police state can always send their goons after you to force you to tell them what you were typing at gunpoint :/\n\nSo, the best you can do with an untrusted system is to take your own Live-CD/Live-USB and use that, take your own wireless keyboard and plug it into a usb port other than the one the system's own keyboard is on (eliminating hardware loggers both hidden in the keyboard, and ones on that port hidden in the computer, in hopes they didn't use a hardware logger for each port on the entire system), learn to spot cameras (including likely spots for hidden ones), and if you're in a police state, finish what you're doing and be somewhere else in less time than the response time of the local police.\n\nA: I just want to throw in something that I did not know existed on Linux: Secure Text Input.\nOn xterm, Ctrl+click -> \"Secure Keyboard\". This makes a request to isolate xterm keystrokes from other x11 apps. This doesn't prevent kernel loggers, but is just one level of protection.\n\nA: Yes, Ubuntu can have a key-logger.  Its far fetched, but it can happen.  It can be exploited via a browser and an attacker can run code with your user privileges.  It can use auto-start services which run programs on login. Any program can get scan codes of pressed keys in X Window System. It is easily demonstrated with xinput command. See GUI isolation for more details.1\nlinux key loggers needs to have a root  access before they can monitor the keyboard. unless they don't gain that privilege they can't run a key logger.   The only thing that you can do is check for rootkits.  To do that you can use CHKROOTKIT \n1Source:superuser.com\n\nA: Linux keyloggers can be made from languages that are compatible with the system and would require the use of local file storage to record this data and, if programmed to do so, if you do have a keylogger that was manually programmed or downloaded to work with this operating system then it may actually be a file, possibly renamed to look like a system file, anywhere on the system.\nLast time I created/had a keylogger on my system this was the situation and it was easy to detect and remove but it included manually finding the source and this took a little time.\nIf you do have a keylogger of this type, I'd attempt to find and remove it but if it is indeed something that was downloaded or installed I'd consider this highly unlikely as Linux is a secure operating system that is usually not suspect to forms of viruses you would normally find on Windows systems.\n", "Q: Is there a default password for the UBUNTU bootable stick?

In order to be able to switch my business to Ubuntu (which I would like to do), I have to be able to run these programs, and particularly print data. I have tried printing in DosEmu, but that locks the program up, have tried DosBox, which seems to be more stable and runs things fine, but will not print. So I tried printing to a file in DosBox and have this manually printed with:\nlp -d HP-LaserJet-m2727-MFP /home/paul/dosdrive/*.prn\n\nand that prints fine, but I have to leave the program and close DosBox before the file shows in Ubuntu and I can print it; not ideal for a business package.\nI have found a DosBox SVN Daum, which I have tried on an XP machine, is stable and prints fine, but this is only available for Windows. The source code is available for this program, but compiling this is well beyond my expertise. Is there any way around all this?\n\nA: On an enthusiast site there is a special build of dosbox for Linux based systems; the 32 bit version is still available there, although there are older 64 bit versions if you need them. You don't need to compile it (although I would probably compile the official dosbox-0.74 source code and just integrate the printer patch: see here for more information on SVN builds and compiling dosbox).\nNevertheless, if you don't wish to compile you can use these builds from that site: I have checked them and they are fine, but, as we normally say with other things such as ppas, use at your own risk. The 32 bit version does include 'almost' all the patches in the Windows version. The download includes a dosbox executable, a dosbox_debug executable and a dosbox conf.\nThe dosbox conf includes the printing support:\n    [printer]\n#     printer: Enable printer emulation.\n#         dpi: Resolution of printer (default 360).\n#       width: Width of paper in 1/10 inch (default 85 = 8.5'').\n#      height: Height of paper in 1/10 inch (default 110 = 11.0'').\n# printoutput: Output method for finished pages: \n#                png     : Creates PNG images (default)\n#                ps      : Creates Postscript\n#                bmp     : Creates BMP images (very huge files, not recommend)\n#              \n#   multipage: Adds all pages to one Postscript file or printer job until CTRL-F2 is pressed.\n#     docpath: The path where the output files are stored.\n#     timeout: (in milliseconds) if nonzero: the time the page will\n#              be ejected automatically after when no more data\n#              arrives at the printer.\n\nprinter=true\ndpi=360\nwidth=85\nheight=110\nprintoutput=png\nmultipage=false\ndocpath=.\ntimeout=0\n\nHowever, before you run it, you must install some important dependencies (you will probably have the sdl ones already):\nsudo apt-get install libphysfs1 libpng12-0 libsdl1.2debian libsdl-sound1.2 libsdl-net1.2\n\nSo to make sure you do not get your normal dosbox confused with this one, keep this alternative dosbox and its conf file in a folder in your home folder and open terminal and run it with, for example,\n/home/mike/DOS/dosbox -conf dosbox.conf\n\n", "Q: How can I bring all windows of an application to the front? Sometimes I want to bring all the windows of one application to the top. It seems that the only way to do this in Unity currently is to switch to each window individually (either by using alt-tab, clicking on the launcher icon and selecting each window, or minimizing all other windows). I'm guessing it's possible to hack something together using wmctrl to do this but I'm hoping for a simpler solution.\n\nA: You can use wmctrl for this:\nThere is a shortcut for all windows, e.g. if you just want to undo going to the desktop:\nwmctrl -k off\n\nIf you really need to bring up just a specific app, you can use a script, as follows, but\nit will bring up all windows on all workspaces.  E.g. to bring up all gnome-terminals, you could do\npids=\" $(pidof gnome-terminal) \"\nwmctrl -lp | while read id a pid b; do\n  test \"${pids/ $pid }\" != \"$pids\" && wmctrl -i -a $id\ndone\n\n\nA: If you just need to find all the windows of an application (with a preview of the contents in each) then click the app's icon twice in the launcher bar. The first time you click it will make the most recent window of the app active and the second time it will give you a preview of all the app's windows. \nThat isn't technically the same as \"bringing them to the top\" but might meet the actual need you have (to find all the open email windows for example).\n\nA: Building on @Lajos' excellent answer to work with any app:\nfunction showall {\n  pids=\" $(pidof $1) \"\n  wmctrl -lp | while read id a pid b\n  do test \"${pids/ $pid }\" != \"$pids\" && wmctrl -i -a $id; done\n}\n\nThen call it like this:\nshowall gnome-terminal\nshowall nautilus\nshowall chrome\n\n", "Q: Unable to connect to wireless networks after 12.04 automatic update I have downloaded and installed Ubuntu 12.04 x64 and ran automatic update.After which though i see them but am unable to create or connect to any wireless networks (AD-HOC or existing).\n\nA: You can use this command to unblock all wireless devices:\nsudo rfkill unblock all\n\n", "Q: fb: conflicting fb hw usage inteldrmfb vs EFI VGA - removing generic driver Ubuntu fails to boot.

Do I need to install an app?  If so, which app do you recommend.  I am new to Linux, and presently settled on Lubuntu.\n\nA: Lubu!\nFirst, I would install the lightweight photo manager called gThumb. You can install it by pasting the following code into your terminal.\nsudo apt-get install gthumb\n\nSecond, you will need to connect your camera to the computer. There are a few ways to do this, depending on your camera. \n\n\n*\n\n*The easiest is to insert the SD card into your computer SD port (if it has one).  \n\n*The alternate way is to connect your entire camera to the computer via a USB cable.\n\n\nYou should see a pop-up that appears after you complete the connection above. Chose the gThumb option.\n\nFinally, follow the import steps/options given by gThumb. Be sure your folder destination is your home/USERNAME/Pictures directory. That keeps your directories clean and simple.\nIf you did not see a popup when you connected your camera, the alternative way is to open gThumb and chose the import option (File -> Import From -> Removable Device)\n\nYou will again have upload options. \n\nFinally, there are other options instead of gThumb that you may like. Here are four more standard options. I like gThumb because it fits Lubuntu's philosophy: (1) Lightweight and (2) Minimalist.\nEnjoy your photos!\n", "Q: Error: no such partition after installing Ubuntu 12.04 Yesterday I decided to install Ubuntu 12.04 as I have already installed Windows 7 and want to go for dual boot. The problem is it doesn't shows me the boot menu. This is what I get:\nError: no such partition\ngrub rescue>\n\nFirst, I installed it manually and when I saw this message, I started searching for the solution. Tried to fix it many ways - recommended boot repair, manual GRUB2 reinstall, GRUB2 upgrade, ensured that it's in the right dev/sda drive and dev/sda7 partition (in my case), but still the error occurs... Even when I used EasyBCD, I made a Ubuntu boot entry but when I select it, the same happens.\nSo, I deleted all linux partitions and tried automatically with the alongside option in the installer. The main partition was sda6. Well, it didn't fixed it again. After then I restored the original MBR of win7 and now I'm writing you through it. Here is the boot info script.  What am I doing wrong? \nAnother mess up happened, somehow after the alonside install and after I deleted its linux partitions. Gparted shows that my logical partition(Local Disk D) have bad sectors and it is with extended file system, while Acronis disk director and windows disk manager shows everything is ok and it is as it was before - ntfs file system. There's no any data loss in that partition or problems, maybe its something from GParted? \n\n\nA: Your Ubuntu partition is far (>100GB) from the start of the disk.

I've been trying to make my own custom xubuntu-based distro. I thought I understood how to import settings and features and repackage using remastersys, but apparently not.\nOne of the features involves removing the xfce4-panel and replacing it with cairo-dock(with my own theme), but with each ISO it keeps asking me to how I want to configure xfce4-panel and forgets about auto-starting cairo-dock. \nAlso when I do manually start cairo-dock it doesn’t have the theme i designed selected by default. I made sure I selected my user-name when configuring remastersys, as well as copying over the files/directories from my home directory to /etc/skel/. I even later moved my user-space over to /etc/skel/, but to no avail.

I downloaded a very simple .exe key logger file that opens a temp folder on the C: drive and auto logs all keystrokes.\nI tried putting it into the startup folder and setting the attributes of the file as hidden, so she cant see it in the startup folder, but this stops the program from functioning altogether.\nIs there a way of getting the program to run (hidden) where she can't find it?\nI'm not a very advanced computer user - although she is - and I need a foolproof method.\n\nA: I'm not sure this is an Ubuntu question, you are describing trying to use a Windows program. but ---\nI remember that managing a young person's use of the Internet can be difficult.\nWe made a rule that he could only connect when we were home, and only on the computer in the family room.\nWhen he broke the rule I set up the computer so that it couldn't be used on the Internet unless I unlocked its software (after we grounded him for a while).

Plugging it in back there will hide it. To know if this will work, just follow the keyboard cable to the back of the computer. Pay attention to where it connects so you can put it back into the same hole. Briefly unplug it to look at the connection type.

If it has a round connection, this will not work.\nhttp://www.keyghost.com/USB-Keylogger.htm\n", "Q: high performance with xen, vmware or virtualbox I was wondering which is the best method to go about if I want to play win based games.\nI do not want to go with the dual boot method as this will cost me time to restart, login and run a os to do my work or pass the time, and some of my apps rely on win and my graphics to run. for example Daz3d, Photoshop, Flash etc.\nNow I read about HVM(hardware virtual machines) and then I know about the 3D Virtualization of VMware and VirtualBox. However, the 2 later virtualize the 3D and do not using the full power of the GPU. So this option wont perform perfect for latest games like D3.\nI was wondering if anyone has experience in HVM(like xen if i am not mistaken) and tried something similar to access the full power of the GPU and successfully run newer games and other products relying on the GPU? \nWill be the first time setting up a HVM, no experience in this so don't know what to expect.\nThis will help a lot as I do not want to revert back to win or as mentioned do dual boot.\n\nA: With PCI/VGA Passthrough on Xen (and afaik kvm, too), people is playing on vm with direct hardware access passed to vm. With little to none decrese in performance. Vmware and Virtualbox are tools to toy.\n\nA: Windows can be installed as a HVM guest with Xen, but your hardware needs to support virtualization technologies for this to be useful for your intended purposes. \nUsing Xen with a Windows HVM domU, you can use VGA and PCI pass-through in order to give the Windows virtual machine direct access to a GPU. However, the catch is that your Processor, Motherboard, and potentially GPU need to support Intel VT-d or AMD's equivalent. \nTracking down the proper hardware will probably be the largest prohibiting factor. I say this because, while the technology has existed for quite some time, it's not a feature that many consumer users are interested in and therefore has not been supported well among manufacturers, specifically speaking motherboard manufacturers. You can find hardware that the Xen community has found to work, but technology moves so quickly, it may be difficult to find parts that have been verified to work, available to purchase. Many parts may have been discontinued. Also, just because the chipset and cpu support vt-d, that doesn't mean that the BIOS for the motherboard supports vt-d, which makes tracking down the proper hardware all the more difficult.\nAssuming you obtain the proper hardware, it is then simply a matter of installing a linux distribution to act as the dom0 or host that you will then install the Xen hypervisor on. You will need to fiddle around a bit to get the GRUB loader to load the Xen bootstrap, since by default the standard bootstrap will load first, thus trumping the Xen bootstrap. \nThe documentation is varied and contradictory as this process is fairly niche and as of 4.2+ some significant changes have been made as to how certain tools and systems operate, namely network bridging, routing, NAT translation, etc. There is current documentation in existence, but there is also plenty of old and outdated information available. \nOnce you get the network configuration setup, you will need to ensure that you have at least two GPUs. This ties in with the proper hardware I spoke of earlier. The ideal way to go is to have an Intel CPU with integrated graphics to support your Xen dom0, while having a nice gaming GPU to VGA and PCI passthrough to your Windows domU. However, as I stated before vt-d is necessary in order to perform the VGA and PCI passthrough. \nI currently have an HP dv7-3085dx from 2009 that I have Ubuntu as the dom0 with Xen and Windows 8 as an HVM. While this HP laptop supports vt-d and I can pass hardware through to the Windows HVM, I cannot pass-through a GPU to the Windows HVM without crippling my dom0, as this laptop only has one VGA supportable GPU. This leaves me with a Windows HVM that works well other than choppy graphical performance, which unfortunately makes the Windows HVM rather useless. \nWith the proper hardware you can have a Windows HVM that can play brand new games on Ultra with 60+ FPS. I unfortunately do not currently possess the proper hardware to take advantage of the vt-d technologies, but there are plenty of YouTube videos of people that do. You can search for their benchmark tests to get an idea of how well this technology works when you have proper hardware. \n--EDIT--\nTo follow up with this, it may be technically possible to use a single graphics processor for the dom0 and domU. However, you would need to setup the dom0 to allow you to SSH from a separate machine in order to launch the domU, since you would have to blacklist the GPU in the dom0 boot sequence in order to make it available to the domU. This would mean that you need to use two machines in order to make the single machine usable. \nSo, you would SSH into the dom0, launch the domU. Assuming that you have the VGA pass-through setup properly, once you have the domU running, you will VNC into it from the second machine. Then you ensure that your passed through GPU shows up and has drivers installed. Then you select that GPU as the default display adapter and hope that you get video output to the monitor physically attached to the machine the domU is running on.\n\nA: *\n\n*Xen HVM is...exactly the same virtualization as VMware and Virtualbox; there's no difference. It's only called that because there's another kind called Xen PVM (para-virtualized), which can only run Linux VMs and is more efficient in some cases.\n\n*To be honest, while both VMWare and Vbox have rudimentary 3D support (Xen HVM has none -- it's mostly meant for servers), it will 99.9% be insufficient to run modern 3D games, no matter how powerful your CPU or GPU. You will have to dual-boot, unless your favorite games are Wolfenstein, Doom and Quake 1 :p\n\nA: Xen hypervisor allows you to run a Windows VM with direct access to your graphics card (hardware). This is called VGA passthrough. You can also directly access other PC hardware using PCI passthrough, for example USB host controllers, SATA controllers, etc., all of which will then be available under Windows, with Windows-native drivers.\nBUT, as mentioned before, you need to carefully select your hardware. Here some basic guidelines to check if your hardware is compatible:\n\n\n*\n\n*Your CPU must support VT-d (Intel) or AMD-Vi / IOMMU (AMD) !!! Don't confuse it with VT-x - these are two different things. For Intel, see ark.intel.com. Note: The 3930K with C2 stepping also supports VT-d, but it's not listed when using the VT-d filter.\n\n*Your motherboard (and motherboard BIOS) must have an option to enable VT-d (sometimes called IOMMU). Some BIOS implementations have been reported buggy, though. Still, if the option shows up, chances are good.\n\n*A VGA-passthrough compatible graphics adapter. Many (most?) AMD graphics cards are supported, and some Nvidia cards, namely the professional \"multi-OS\" Quadro series (starting from the Quadro 2000 upwards). The Intel onboard graphics is supposedly also compatible. Search for \"Xen VGA passthrough tested adapters\". \nNote: It's best to have a another GPU (Intel onboard or separate graphics card) for your Linux, and pass-through the secondary GPU (the one NOT used by Linux).\nIf you got compatible hardware, it's definitely worth the effort. Search for \"VGA passthrough\" or \"virtual gaming\" to find tutorials, or try this here HOW-TO make dual-boot obsolete which is based on Linux Mint 13 (should be similar for Ubuntu).\n", "Q: Wireless is disabled by hardware switch(wubi) on a Toshiba Tecra S1 I'm using toshiba tecra s1 and it has a problem in ubuntu 12.04\nI installed ubuntu with wubi but it says wireless is disabled by hardware switch\nand I tried to off airplane mode and #rfkill unblock all \nand fn keys doesn't work, help me\n\nA: Have you checked the BIOS settings?\nI experienced something similar with a Dell laptop that I had just purchased from a friend and had a heck of a time trying to figure out what the problem was. It had Windows 7, which was another first experience for me, at that time and I thought maybe it had something to do with the network settings in the OS. I searched through every settings menu I could find, tore apart the Windows help guide and still could find nothing wrong. Besides, of course, my Wi-Fi being disabled via hardware switch. My Fn key worked for everything else, like suspend and monitor switching, but when I'd use it to try to turn on the Wifi it would just disconnect my wired network leaving Wifi unchanged.\nSoon after, I decided to try out DSLinux and while looking through my BIOS I discovered what the OS must've been referring to as the Hardware switch. Ironically, it was on the same page as the USB emulation switch. The LAN controller was on, but the wireless was switched off. I toggled the switch and found that it had three settings; on, off and on/off toggle with Fn key.\nNot sure if you've checked this or not as you didn't mention it, but I thought I'd share my experience and hopefully it helps you or another who runs into this problem.\nAnother idea that just came to me, not sure if this is a possibility or not, but maybe it's disabled in Windows. I'm not sure that'd keep it from being toggled while in Ubuntu or not, but it's worth checking out as well. Good Luck :)\n", "Q: An SNMP application is listening on port 161, how do I shut it down?

If the copy still fails, then you have the data corruption issue (thus, see above). If the copy works, then it is a permission issue with user IDs.

When I answer an email in Evolution 3.2.3 (Ubuntu 12.04) the new text I write has the paragraph style \"normal\" and is wrapped, but the quoted text of the email I answer to has the paragraph style \"preformatted\" and is not wrapped. As my screen is only 15 inch although wide, I normally don't see to whole text. I need to change the paragraph style manually for the quoted email part to \"normal\" so the next is wrapped and readable without the need to scroll to to side every line.

Once it is allocated, it will not show up as \"free\" or \"unallocated\" anymore. To fix this simply start a balance\nbtrfs balance start \"path\"\n\nyou can also tell the balance command, to only balance chunks, which are used for acertain percentage - like 0% which would mean the chunks are empty:\nbtrfs balance start \"path\" -dusage=0 -musage=0\n\nparameter -d means options for the data.\nparameter -m means options for the metadata. \nplay with the balance command, it should help. \n\nA: Look at the output from btrfs fi df:\nData: total=50.00GB, used=49.17GB\nSystem: total=32.00MB, used=4.00KB\nMetadata: total=24.50GB, used=9.86GB\n\nThe total part is the allocated space, while used is the actually used by btrfs. The difference between total and used (around 15 GB) is your missing space. As you can see, it has already been allocated for metadata blocks.\nI only have hobby experience with btrfs, but I don't think a ext4 conversion is the best way to create a well laid out btrfs filesystem. Fortunately, you can rebalance the whole filesystem to make it re-do all allocations.\nAs always, use backups.\n", "Q: GRUB not installed I installed Ubuntu 12.04 Desktop (32 Bit, i386) on the second hard disk of a PC using a CD-ROM.

I no longer am able to get Thunderbird running. Is there a way of modifying the email account information outside of Thunderbird, or wiping what's in there w/o completely blowing away my profile and starting from scratch?\n\nA: You could try to start Thunderbird with the \"safe-mode\" option by entering in the terminal thunderbird -safe-mode, which sometimes allows one to start the program when it won't start normally. This is effectively a debug mode which makes Thunderbird start without addons disabled and with only the most basic configuration options enabled.\nAlternatively, you could find your .thunderbird folder in your home folder by viewing hidden files in your file explorer. Then you should be able to navigate to the various folders, although you won't be able to access the stored passwords as they are kept encrypted in sqlite databases. So backup your profile first if you want, then navigate to .thuderbird/<profile.default>/ then delete signons.sqlite and key3.db to remove your passwords and logins. This only removes the passwords, but it will be enough to get Thunderbird running again if my first method fails.\n\n", "Q: Ambiance seemingly uninstalled after Update Problem: Updated on 30/07/2012 (no idea what was updated, noticed a lot of updates to Qt), restarted, and was greeted with a broken, painful looking desktop. \nTried $ unity --reset\nBut system complained - \"Window Manager warning: Failed to load theme \"Ambiance\": Failed to find a valid file for theme Ambiance\n\n\nA: I was able to fix this problem by reinstalling Ambiance with the following command, and restarting the computer.\nsudo apt-get install light-themes\n", "Q: Problem with installing Some Packages and Updating my Ubuntu I am somewhat new to this operating system. I have been using it since 6 months. Initially there was no problem with my operating system but since the day I messed up with some wine software whenever I Click on \"Check\" in the update software section after a while a window is popping up and it says \"Failed to download repository information\" When I click on details it is something like this:\nW:Failed to fetch http://archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/dists/precise/Release  Unable to find expected entry 'commercial/binary-amd64/Packages' in Release file (Wrong sources.list entry or malformed file)\n, W:Failed to fetch http://security.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/dists/precise-security/Release  Unable to find expected entry 'commercial/binary-amd64/Packages' in Release file (Wrong sources.list entry or malformed file)\n, W:Failed to fetch http ://archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/dists/precise-updates/Release  Unable to find expected entry 'commercial/binary-amd64/Packages' in Release file (Wrong sources.list entry or malformed file)\n\n, E:Some index files failed to download. They have been ignored, or old ones used instead.\n\nI am unable to figure out the actual problem since a couple of days. I am even unable to install some Software like VLC,SKYPE,TeamViewer even Wine also. I am being reported the same problem always it is something like this: \nPackage dependencies cannot be resolved\n\nThis error could be caused by required additional software packages which are missing or not installable. Furthermore there could be a conflict between software packages which are not allowed to be installed at the same time.\n\n\nThe following packages have unmet dependencies:\n\nvlc: Depends: vlc-nox (= 2.0.3+git20120729+r318-0~r40~precise1) but 2.0.3+git20120729+r318-0~r40~precise1 is to be installed\n     Depends: libavcodec-extra-53 (>= 4:0.8-1~) but 4:0.8.3ubuntu0.12.04.1 is to be installed\n     Depends: libavutil-extra-51 (>= 4:0.8-1~) but 4:0.8.3ubuntu0.12.04.1 is to be installed\n     Depends: libc6 (>= 2.15) but 2.15-0ubuntu10 is to be installed\n     Depends: libfreetype6 (>= 2.2.1) but 2.4.8-1ubuntu2 is to be installed\n     Depends: libgcc1 (>= 1:4.1.1) but 1:4.6.3-1ubuntu5 is to be installed\n     Depends: libqtcore4 (>= 4:4.8.0) but 4:4.8.1-0ubuntu4.2 is to be installed\n     Depends: libqtgui4 (>= 4:4.7.0~beta1) but 4:4.8.1-0ubuntu4.2 is to be installed\n     Depends: libstdc++6 (>= 4.6) but 4.6.3-1ubuntu5 is to be installed\n     Depends: zlib1g (>= 1:1.2.3.3.dfsg) but 1:1.2.3.4.dfsg-3ubuntu4 is to be installed\n\nI became so ardent user of Ubuntu that It's impossible for me to uninstall and install it again. Can someone help me out here.?\n\nA: Just press Ctrl+Alt+T on your keyboard to open Terminal.

Backup that file first!\n", "Q: Update Manager failed to download repository, 401 error I haven't used my Ubuntu install in about 2 months. I went on last night and first thing I did was update, but I got this message saying it failed to download the repository and to check my connections, even though my internet is fine. Here is the error log:\nW:Failed to fetch https://private-ppa.launchpad.net/commercial-ppa-uploaders/multiwinia/ubuntu/dists/precise/main/binary-amd64/Packages  The requested URL returned error: 401\nW:Failed to fetch https://private-ppa.launchpad.net/commercial-ppa-uploaders/multiwinia/ubuntu/dists/precise/main/binary-i386/Packages  The requested URL returned error: 401\nE:Some index files failed to download. They have been ignored, or old ones used instead.\n\nI noticed that it has the name of Multiwinia in the file path, which is a game I downloaded from the software store roughly 3 months ago. I removed it to see if that would fix the issue, but to no avail.\nAny help on the issue would be much appreciated.\n\nA: Apparently the ppa got added, when you installed the game and now the ppa is broken or suspended. At least that's my best guess. It should be save do remove those repositories from your list. To do so got to:\n\nSoftware Center -> Edit menu -> Software Sources -> Click the tab Other Sources -> Unselect the ppas in question.\nIf that doesn't work try to change the download server to the best one:\n\nFirst three steps from above -> Download from -> Other -> Select Best Server\n\nA: Software in Ubuntu is installed from package repositories containing a number of packages. This is different from the 'click next' installers in Windows. \nSo, you have removed Multiwinia, but the repositories remain there. \nBut having the repositories there is usually not an issue, the error occurs due to unstable Internet connection or repository issues.\nTo remove the repository, open Ubuntu Software Center > Edit menu > Software Sources > click the 'Other Software' tab > Uncheck the unwanted repositories with 'multiwinia' in it.\nOR\nOpen a Terminal > type:\nsudo gedit /etc/apt/sources.list\n\nRemove these lines: [careful with this file!]\nhttps://private-ppa.launchpad.net/commercial-ppa-uploaders/multiwinia/ubuntu/dists/precise/main/binary-amd64/Packages \nhttps://private-ppa.launchpad.net/commercial-ppa-uploaders/multiwinia/ubuntu/dists/precise/main/binary-i386/Packages \nHopefully this solves your issue. \nEdit: There are more repository list files in /etc/apt/sources.list.d folder.\nFor example, Google Chrome repos are in /etc/apt/sources.list.d/google-chrome.list\nSo, you may look in /etc/apt/sources.list.d for files like multiwinia.list and remove the file. Do take a backup before you delete or edit anything unless you are absolutely sure of what you are doing.\n\nA: Go to Update Manager --> click on Settings ---> Software Sources wizard opens ... then go to other sources --> uncheck the PPA's which are giving trouble.\nOnce you done with this close the wizard and click on check updates in the Update Manager.\n\nA: Select tab \"Other Software\"\nFrom the \"Other Software\" tab, disable all PPA repositories, leaving only the official Ubuntu repositories active. Enabling too many PPA repositories (which are non-official) can cause your package manager to become unstable.\n\nA: I have been having the same issue. Unfortunately the USC seems to be having issues with installing previously purchased software all together. My solution has been the following:\n\n\n*\n\n*Log into Launchpad\n\n*Go To your account by clicking on your name in the upper right of your browser.\n\n*Click on \"View your private PPA subscriptions\"\n\n*Choose View on the previously purchase software listing on this page.\n\n*Under \"Custom sources.list entries\" there are 2 lines that show your private ppa information. Copy the first line. (deb https://username:password@private-ppa.launchpad.net/commercial-ppa-uploaders/SOFTWARE/ubuntu YOUR_UBUNTU_VERSION_HERE main #yada yada yada)\n\n*Open Update Manager and click Settings.\n\n*When the Software Sources window comes up go to Other Software\n\n*Remove the Entry that states \"Added by...\" (I can't quite remember the rest but it has something to do with store in auth.conf in the title)\n\n*Enter your Admin password when prompted.\n\n*Paste the line you copied from Launchpad and edit YOUR_UBUNTU_VERSION_HERE (I'm under 12.04 so I put precise there).\n\n*Click Add Source then Add the next line (deb-src line) and edit the YOUR_UBUNTU_VERSION_HERE to your version and hit Add Source.\n\n*Click Close on the Software Sources and Refresh.\n\n*You can find the name of the package through the Software Center, but DO NOT INSTALL IT. The name is shown under More Info (For example MC-Launcher is mc-launcher) it's after Version near the Support Website listing. do not copy the version number just the part before it.\n\n*Open Terminal (CTRL+T) and type\n\nsudo apt-get install\n\nThen paste your package name.\nThis has been the Only method I have been able to install previously purchased items. And the commericial-ppa-uploaders page results in a timeout. So you can't issue a bug with the ppa owners.\n"]
