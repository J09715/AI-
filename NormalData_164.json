["Q: The 'Software Updater' does not have enough disk space on /boot drive The 'Software Updater' states my computer does not have enough disk space on the /boot drive. It instructed me to free up enough space, but I do not have permission to delete any files. What should I do?\nAlso, deleting general files (pics, videos, etc.) off my hard drive does not help.\n\nA: The boot partition is full. You will need to remove some old linux image files from that partition to make room. The steps to do this have already been posted in this question here: How do I free up more space in /boot?\n", "Q: IDLE won't open .py files when I use ctrl+O I've already tried to get .py files to open with IDLE by default, but no luck.

I have LVM. I deleted old kernels and used Ubuntu Tweak.\nI tried to loaded from LiveCD and with gparted grow up my /boot-size, but gparted not giving me ability to make more space for /boot - only to shrink.\n\nI see hidden folder .Trash-0 in my /boot with old kernels. I can't delete any file in this folder - they are recreating with new number in name. I have empty trash can. How I can delete this files?\n\nA: You probably have lots of old kernels installed. Run this command: dpkg -l 'linux-image-3*' and remove all the kernel packages that don't match the running kernel (check with uname -r).\n\nA: I have deleted kernels in hidden folder /boot/.Trash-0. I fix my problem by deleting files in this folder by pressing SHIFT + DEL.\n\nA: After you delete unneeded files, a simple way to empty /boot/.Trash-0 is:\n1) open a terminal\n2) use sudo xterm (or whatever terminal you like) to open a second terminal session\n3) in the second terminal, go to the trash folder with cd /boot/.Trash-0\n4) check to make sure you're in /boot/.Trash-0 with pwd\n5) remove everything in .Trash-0 with rm  -r  (be careful, that will remove everything in and below the current directory)\n6) check to confirm everything has been removed with ls -l\nThis works in 14.04 LTS, and probably other versions, but...

I want to install Lubuntu on a 10 year old PC with a 2.66GHz Celeron CPU with 1.5Gb of RAM. It has PAE capabilities. It will only be used for web browsing and office.\nGiven that the users are not Linux experts and prefer a Windows like experience is there any desktop which resembles windows as to make the transition easier?\nIf I install Unity and Wine later will that degrade that advantages of Lubuntu? Excuse these questions but I am on a learning curve right now.\nThanks,\nJoseph\n\nA: You probably won't be able to use Unity on that machine, it's too old. But you can use Lubuntu or Ubuntu without Unity.\n\nA: I recommend Lubuntu. My machines are old and they run very smooth with Lubuntu. The users coming from Windows XP will be familiarized with the new OS in a very short time. Unity on older machines could cause some slow down issues due to the consumption of resources. On the other side, Wine won't cause any degradation, as long as the applications you are planning to run under Wine are not too heavy.\n\nA: I have Lubuntu running on a P3-1.12 Ghz , 512MB RAM and it flies. \nOn my Celeron 2.4 Ghz , 1GB RAM, KDE was noticably sluggish so I tried both the XFCE & LXDE Desktops (which is default for Lubuntu), and they work great. \nIMHO - Mint Linux is the most Windows like, in my experience. \n", "Q: wine1.6 : Depends: libgettextpo0 but it is not installable I get this problem every time I try and get wine 1.6 on Ubuntu 12.04.

For instance, the 3D module: I have something installed but I do not know what to import and if it's realy the right module (the installed-one is: Qt 3D module: libqt53d5)\nThank you! : )\n\nA: This is because Ubuntu Touch uses Qt 5 and qtmultimediakit is an older Qt Mobility module. See this quote from Qt's website:  \n\nThe Qt Multimedia module in Qt 5 combines (and replaces) two older modules, namely the Qt Multimedia module from Qt 4.x, and Qt Multimedia Kit module from Qt Mobility. Existing code that uses Qt Multimedia from Qt 4 can be ported with minimal effort, but porting code that uses Qt Multimedia Kit may be a more involved process. The changed features section highlights changes relevant to porting.  \n\nIn other words, the Qt Multimedia module in Qt 5 is the successor to QtMultimediaKit. Since Ubuntu Touch only uses Qt 5 I don't think QtMultimediaKit would work.  \nThe reason your import didn't work was because the QtMultiMediaKit files are stored in /usr/lib/<architecture>/ while the SDK only looks in the qt5 folder of /usr/lib/<architecture>/.  \nLong story short, using the Qt 5 Multimedia Module is the right way of doing it!\n", "Q: How can I check my favorated commands from the terminal?

Is it possible without installing the ntp package? I did not find any way to change the server from the dialog.\n\nA: There are two main ways to set the current time via NTP: ntpdate is a command-line tool that, when run, fetches the current time from an NTP server and sets the system time accordingly. ntpd is the NTP daemon which runs in the background and continuously adjusts the time slightly.\nFor servers, production environments and such, ntpd is better. However, for normal desktop PCs and end users, ntpdate is perfectly fine. In fact, when you install Ubuntu Desktop, it comes with ntpdate preinstalled, but not ntpd.\nWhen you select \"Automatically from the Internet\" in your Ubuntu system settings as shown in your screenshot above, what happens is that at each boot Ubuntu will fetch the current time using ntpdate from ntp.ubuntu.com. If you want to change that server, you can edit the value of NTPSERVERS in /etc/default/ntpdate.\nThe alternative is to install ntpd (in package ntp), and configure that via /etc/ntp.conf. This is explained here in more detail:\nhttps://help.ubuntu.com/lts/serverguide/NTP.html\nHowever, if you do not want to install any additional packages and simply change the default server for ntpdate which comes pre-installed with Ubuntu, simply edit /etc/default/ntpdate.\n\nA: For Ubuntu 16.10 Desktop the config file (without installing ntp packages) is \n/etc/systemd/timesyncd.conf\n\n", "Q: Kicked out back to login.

I used this WebUpd8 guide to help me trim my SSD on Ubuntu 13.10. The guide says that\n\nyou must make sure the partition(s) are EXT4 or BTRFS.\n\nUnfortunately, I stupidly assumed the HD was formatted to ext4; it's actually FAT32.\nvar/log/trim suggests that it's working:\n*** Sun, 15 Dec 2013 11:30:42 +0000 ***\n/: 50567962624 bytes were trimmed\n\nBut is it actually doing something? Or will I have to re-format the drive and start all over again?\nSorry if this sounds a little paranoid. Any reassurance is much appreciated.\n\nA: I see that this is an old question ... but it comes up early in searches on the topic, so it seemed to be worth giving an answer from the kernel sources.\nThere are two different ways a Linux filesystem implementation can \"support\" TRIM:\n\n\n*\n\n*It can support the -o discard mount option, so blocks that become free are trimmed immediately\n\n*It can support the FITRIM ioctl, which is what the userland fstrim command uses to trim all currently-free blocks in bulk when requested\nA given filesystem implementation can support one, or the other, or both (or none).\nAs it turns out, the FAT implementation has been able to do discard since kernel 2.6.28. That even predates the mount option, which didn't appear until 2.6.33. From 2.6.28 through 2.6.32, FAT just was written to discard unconditionally. Since 2.6.33, you can control whether it does or not.\nAs for the FITRIM ioctl, well, that became a thing in 2.6.37, but I do not see any sign that the FAT filesystem code supports it, even in the latest, greatest (as of today) 4.13rc5. Several other filesystems have implemented it, but no one seems to have bothered for FAT.\nThat's sort of too bad, because there's at least one perfectly common scenario where you would want a way to TRIM all the existing free blocks at once: you've given your ancient Banana 6000 a nice upgrade by dd-ing the full disk image from the old spinning drive to a shiny new SSD, so now, as far as the SSD is concerned, all of those blocks have been written, whether they matter to the filesystem or not. So, of course, you'd like the ones considered free by the filesystem to be trimmed.\nBut there may be hope. While I haven't had a chance to try it yet, I think this might work:\n\n\n*\n\n*Mount the filesystem (be sure to use -o discard).\n\n*Create some empty files.\n\n*Blow those up to the maximum possible size using fallocate -n (which allocates the blocks without writing anything to them, so will not put much extra wear on the SSD). For FAT32 a file is limited to just under 4 GiB, so that's why you may need a bunch of temporary files to use up all the free space. (For this step to work, you need kernel 4.5 or later, where FAT has fallocate support.)\n\n*Once you've filled all free space, get rid of the temporary files, letting all the freed blocks be discarded.\n\n\nThis, of course, ought to work as a brute-force fstrim alternative for any filesystem implementation that is able to do discard but not FITRIM.\np.s. I do like the alternate links offered below in Tom Yan's comment. I was working from the more-or-less official git repo, but what I like about the service Tom linked to is that you can more easily switch between different versions of a file to compare.\n\nA: Accordind to the changelog for 2.6.33 from Linux Kernel Newbies:\n\nFAT: make discard a mount option\n\nand Wikipedia:\n\nTrim requests automatically are Ext4, Btrfs, FAT, GFS2 and XFS.\n\nSo yes, it is supported.  But to make sure apply the test from the answer to this question.\nUPDATE:\nSmecki has done the test and confirmed (see comments) that TRIM is working on FAT32 volumes.\n\nA: The following file systems support TRIM: NTFS, HFS+, EXT4, Btrfs. \nMany operating systems now offer TRIM support, which is designed to improve write performance. TRIM allows a NAND flash device's controller to manage the erase process after data is deleted from a cell and before the next write to that cell occurs.\nLinux started supporting TRIM back in late 2008, but not all file systems supported by Linux support TRIM. Microsoft Windows started to support TRIM in late 2009 with Windows Server 2008. OpenSolaris began supporting TRIM in the middle of 2010. Android for mobile devices just started to support TRIM in 2013.\nSo, at this point, many but not all major operating systems support TRIM, which is currently available for SATA interfaces only.\nTRIM (also spelled trim) is a specific command in a serial ATA (SATA) interface that tells an underlying NAND flash solid state storage device which data it can erase. TRIM, which conceptually can be compared to a defrag utility on a spinning hard drive, improves performance by pro-actively freeing up space. \nNAND flash memory organizes data into pages, and pages are grouped together in blocks. Data can be read and written at the page level but can only be erased at the block level. When data is deleted from flash media, the associated pages on the solid-state drive are flagged for deletion, but not erased -- because only blocks can be erased. When a new file is written, individual pages marked for deletion are grouped into a block so they can be erased first, making room for the next write.\nThe TRIM command allows the operating system to notify the solid state drive (SSD) which data in a particular set of pages can be overwritten, allowing the solid state drive’s controller to manage the erase process between the time when the host initiates a delete and the next write. By moving erasing out of the write process, writes can be faster.\nIn order for TRIM to function, the host’s operating system (OS) and storage drivers must support the TRIM command. Here's how the TRIM SSD relationship works. In a Windows 7 environment, for example, when the solid state drive reports it has TRIM support, the operating system will disable disk defragmentation and enable TRIM. Then, when a file on the host’s SSD is deleted, the OS sends a TRIM command to the flash controller telling it which blocks can be deleted. TRIM can also be initiated manually by the user or scheduled on a daily basis.\nTRIM, which is a command and not an acronym, is currently available for SATA interfaces only. The SAS committee has added UNMAP, which is similar to TRIM, to the SAS/SCSI specification.Leah Schoeb \nEDIT\nA Trim command allows an operating system to inform a solid-state drive (SSD) which blocks of data are no longer considered in use and can be wiped internally.\nA TRIM command enables your operating system to find the marked pages before you need them and wipe them clean. Cleaning these data pages beforehand saves you time when you need to write on the data pages again. It's like you have your own recycling guy next to your desk, recycling the pieces of paper as they come.\nIn order to work correctly, TRIM has to be supported by both the solid-state drive and the operating system you are using. When both the OS and the SSD support TRIM individual pages can be cleaned and your solid-state drive will be informed that the pages are now blank and can be written on. \nNot all file systems make use of Trim. Among the file systems that can issue Trim requests automatically are Ext4, Btrfs, FAT, GFS2 and XFS.  However, this is disabled by default due to performance concerns,\nMicrosoft claims that, TRIM has only been implemented on NTFS on Windows 7.  \n", "Q: Configuring Lubuntu to run a script when LXDE starts I'm using Lubuntu and LXDE.

burn that subtitle stream to the output video?\n\nA: The problems\nI see several issues with your command:\n\n\n*\n\n*All filtering should be within one filtergraph.\n\n*You have many contradicting commands: for example you use the scale video filter, then you use -target which will scale, and you use -s which will also scale. You use -acodec copy to stream copy the audio, but you also include -ac 2 to force stereo. These are mutually exclusive so something is being ignored.\n\n*You placed options after the output. I'm not sure how ffmpeg will interpret that. Option placement matters.\nExample\n\nffmpeg -y -i input.mkv -filter_complex \"[0:v:0][0:s:0]overlay[vid]\" -map \"[vid]\" -map 0:a \\\n-target pal-dvd -acodec copy -t 60 output.mpg\n\nNote\nYour video is 720x336, but your subtitles are 720x480. You may have to use crop on the subtitles before using overlay:\n[0:s:0]crop=iw:336[s1];[0:v:0][s1]overlay[vid]\n\nOr alternatively you could use a negative value on the y coordinate in overlay:\n[0:v:0][0:s:0]overlay=0:H-h[vid]\n\n\nA: Assume your input files are infile.mp4, infile.idx and infile.sub, and you wish to combine them all into outfile.mkv, the following is what you need:\nffmpeg -i infile.mp4 -i infile.idx -i infile.sub -map 0:v -map 0:a -c copy -map 1 -c:s:1 dvd_subtitle -metadata:s:s:1 language=fre outfile.mkv\n\n\nA: ffmpeg -i the_equalizer3.mpg -i the_equalizer3.sub -i the_equalizer3.idx -filter_complex \"[0:v][2:s]overlay\" -vcodec mpeg4 -vb 6000000 -r 59.94 -aspect 16:9 -acodec libmp3lame -async 48000 -vol 1250 the_equalizer-captioned2.mp4\n\nThe -filter complex stuff is the important part, above - input 0 is video, input 2 is subtitles, for the overlay.\nIf you have separate vobsub file and idx file, I had some degree of success with above command (using a recent static git release of ffmpeg). The interesting thing was that I had to specify the .idx file for the overlay not the .sub file.  Perhaps extracting the sub title stream, and then import the extracted files when encoding might work?\n", "Q: How to run g++-4.7 installed in the machine using g++ command?

They have a manual here: http://www.lexmark.com/publications/pdfs/print_drivers/en/ug.pdf. It's all quite straightforward.\nP.S. Wine is for running applications (=in the user space), you can't use it to make Windows drivers run under Linux: http://wiki.winehq.org/FAQ\nEDIT. I quoted from my experience of setting up a laser Lexmark on OpenSUSE, however it seems their inkjet printers are much less Linux-friendly.

How do I fix it permanently ? . \nNota: I had to replace lightdm with gdm in oreder to work, although, I don't like gdm .   \n\nA: What graphics card/drivers are you using?

Don't even bother trying to use it.\nBeyond that, the Samsung \"bricking\" problem has been worked around by new kernel features. I don't know precisely when Ubuntu implemented these features, but I'd be shocked if they weren't available in the latest release (13.10).

Now ALL my other GPT partitions are gone: the OEM Windows 8, all the previous data/programs/user files, system, recovery, boot, 16GB Windows image rollback/restore, boot, EFI, etc.\nNo more \"Windows Bootloader\" option after F12 key upon BIOS bootup. \nOf course, No Ubuntu boot option is present either. Never was, always failed in mid-installation, even with 13.04 and 12.04 64bit versions. (Yet this is a new 6GB AMD laptop with new harddisk, four different USB keys or DVD install disks tested to rule out media failures, etc.)\nIn Live mode, off a USB key, Gparted only shows three new partitions, automatically made by the Ubuntu installer. The EFI boot area, the Ubuntu main, and swap at end. None of which are important to me in comparison to the old partitions and structure.\nQuestion,\nHow can I roll back to the previous GPT partition table?\nWhere on the disk might be backups stored, and for the previous Windows bootloader too? What could make this recovery process easiest, since I cannot easily remove the harddisk from the laptop, due to the way it's built? Even if 7GB+ of random data might already be damaged.\n\nA: The short answer: Use your off-disk backups. If you don't have such backups, you now know why you should have them.\nThe long answer: It's possible that you'll be able to recover some of your partitions with TestDisk or something similar; however, this is far from guaranteed. TestDisk works by looking for the \"signatures\" of filesystems and creating new partition table entries to match, but these signatures may have been wiped out when Linux was installed -- after all, installing any OS means writing data to the disk, and at least some of that data is likely to overwrite any pre-existing data, thus destroying it. Note the word: destroy. It's precisely accurate. Even if filesystem signatures remain, it's virtually certain that some critical filesystem data structures and/or file contents have been destroyed. If TestDisk fails, or if the recovered partitions are damaged, you may be able to use PhotoRec or something similar to recover some (conceivably even most) of your individual files. This will be a tedious process, though, and you will not be able to recover a bootable Windows system in this way. For that, you'll almost certainly need to acquire a Windows 8 install disc and re-install the OS.\nI'm sorry you had to learn it this way, but now you know to keep backups of your critical data.\n", "Q: ubuntu iso downloading another iso file Ubuntu iso file is again downloading the file from the installation and if i proceed with the internet connection closed then in middle of the installation it crashes saying that the files is corrupted\n\nA: That's normal.

Grazie e scusate per il problema possibilmente anche stupido\n\n\nA: You have two options:\n1) Install bumblebee (via a PPA as you're on 12.04): https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Bumblebee#Power_Management\n2) Nvidia proprietary drivers now (partially) support Optimus, which you can enable with nvidia-prime as described here: http://www.webupd8.org/2013/08/using-nvidia-graphics-drivers-with.html. Please note however that in this case you won't (yet) be able to switch to the Intel chip for powersaving.\nI know the issue has been discussed on this site before but it was mostly pre-nvidia-prime, and even if I'd personally prefer bumblebee, it would be fair to mention both options.\n", "Q: archive manager error message in 13.10 I have several downloads in archive manager, but when I try to load them I get \"error occurred when loading this archive\".

How can I access or get privileges access and add the files I need to add?\nThank you in advance.\n\nA: As a normal user you cannot simply copy files to system directories. Only root can do that. You can copy your file using the following command:\nsudo cp YOURFILE /var/wordpress/wp-content/themes/\nIf you insist on using a file browser like Nautilus to do this, you can start Nautilus with super-user privileges, but I would personally avoid this. If at all, use with extreme caution:\ngksudo nautilus\nFinally, if you only want to install a theme for a single user, it is probably better to install it into your home directory, rather than a system directory.\n\nA: If it is on the same computer, you should be able to copy the file with:\nsudo cp /SOURCE/FILE /var/wordpress/wp-content/themes/DESTINATION-FILE\n\nor a directory with\nsudo cp -r /SOURCE/FOLDER/ /var/wordpress/wp-content/themes/DESTINATION-FOLDER/\n\nIf you want to move a file or folder, just use:\nsudo mv /SOURCE/FILE /var/wordpress/wp-content/themes/DESTINATION-FILE\n\n\nYou could also just open file manager as root - but this should be used with caution:\ngksudo nautilus\n\nFor more, see here.\n\nAll of the above can be done in terminal, which in Unity can be opened with Ctrl+Alt+T.\n\nEdit:\nIf you want to modify the file as your normal user, just chmod on it. This change the permissions so that it can be modified by users other than root.\nsudo chmod -R 777 /var/wordpress/wp-content/themes/FILE\n\nThere is a manual page on chmod here\n\nAnother Edit:\nA more secure way of doing it would be to make your user the 'owner' of the file - you can do this by:\nsudo chown USERNAME:GROUP /PATH/TO/FILE/\n\nYou can usually use your USERNAME in the place of GROUP.\nThere is a another helpful web page here\nI did a answer a while ago here that might be of use as well.\n", "Q: Sudden flash malfunctions I have begun having some odd problems playing Netflix, Amazon VOD, Hulu, Youtube and other flash videos.  The videos play slightly faster than they should (seems to be 50% faster) and they have no sound.  This happens in Chrome and Netflix-Desktop (using a specialized wine and firefox combo), http://www.compholio.com/netflix-desktop/\nHowever, video works perfectly fine under Firefox (except for netflix-desktop, since it is a program installed on the computer under wine).\nAny help will be appreciated.\n\nA: Regarding the netflix-desktop issue: It is a known bug with pulseaudio and netflix-desktop. You should restart the pulseaudio server, by\npulseaudio -k\n\nRestarting the pulseaudio server may even solve your flash problems with Chrome, so try this first. Or you can find in that bug report a link to a website with another solution.\nChrome uses it's internal flash plugin, whereas Firefox uses the system-wide plugin. If Chrome behaves badly, but firefox not, then most likely it is a problem with the internal plugin. Please look here for other answers.\n\nA: For anyone visiting this question in the future, this is what I did.\nFirst off, I found out that Chrome had a version of Flash that didn't work well with pulseaudio and had issues over-riding HTML 5.  My solution was to use Chromium instead.  I was already undecided on which I liked better, and switching fixed the problem like a charm.  Another solution was to install ALSA, but I didn't want to mess around with my audio system that was working fine other than Chrome.\nThen, there was the problem of netflix-desktop.  My solution was to use pipelight, which is a browser plugin that provides Silverlight functionality.  The guide is here: http://www.webupd8.org/2013/08/pipelight-use-silverlight-in-your-linux.html\nBe sure to follow the entire guide.

Why can't I just open the file that I would of had downloaded an hour ago if I were on windows?  Why is such a simple thing so complicated in ubuntu?\n\nA: Transmission and deluge handle this without problems. Probably qbittorrent is not set as a \"magnet link capable\" software.\nAnyway, if you search for some of your key words on askubuntu you would end up with this:\nHow do I assign magnet links to use qbittorrent?\n\nA: Where are you searching for qbittorrent?

This family of filesystems is case insensitive in terms of filename uniqueness.\nSee also Wikipedia: Case sensitivity on this:\n\nOld Windows filesystems (VFAT, FAT32) are not case-sensitive (there cannot be a readme.txt and a Readme.txt in the same directory) but are case-preserving, i.e. remembering the case of the letters.\n\nThis means you'll have to reformat the drive to another filesystem in case you need two files with the same name except for the casing.\nHowever, I think you can change the name of the file in two-steps:\nmv RELEASE RELEASE-temp\nmv RELEASE-temp release\n\n", "Q: How to remove nautilus without screwing up unity?

To install, click here:\n\nOr run the following command:\nsudo apt install modem-manager-gui\n\n\nV Mobile Broadband\n\nV Mobile Broadband is the original Vodafone Mobile Connect software for Linux rewritten to be compatible with Network Manager by Vodafone's open source Betavine Connection Manager team. Unfortunately, it doesn't seem to be very actively maintained at the moment and isn't available in Ubuntu repos. However, you may try your luck building the project from source. Check out their GitHub page.\nWarning: v-mobile-broadband depends on wader, which replaces Ubuntu's default modemmanager. So, if you encounter problems with the new setup and decide to uninstall v-mobile-broadband, don't forget to reinstall modemmanager package.\n\nSources\n\n*\n\n*In Ubuntu, is there an application like “Huawei Mobile Partner” for broadband dongle modems?\n\nA: You can use the command-line utility gammu for this purpose. If the USSD code to get your balance is (say) *901#, you would execute:\ngammu getussd \"*901#\"\n\nFor installation and configuration instructions and more details, see here.\n\nA: You can do them with the package modem-manager-gui. But it is only available for 13.10. In other versions you have to manage them in Terminal with the package modemmanager.\nIf you are in Ubuntu 13.10:\nsudo apt-get install modem-manager-gui modemmanager\n\nIn other versions of Ubuntu you can do it with the application prepaid-manager-applet\nsudo apt-get install prepaid-manager-applet\n\n\nA: You can use AT commands directly to query your balance via USSD. For that, use any serial terminal program that lets you communicate with your modem directly (putty, minicom etc.).\nI chose atinout because it integrated nicely with the command line. First you install it:\nsudo apt-get install ruby-ronn;\ngit clone git://git.code.sf.net/p/atinout/code atinout;\ncd atinout;\nmake;\nsudo checkinstall make install;\n\nThen, if you use ModemManager (the default under Ubuntu Linux), you might have to disable it first to allow atinout to access your modem:\nsudo stop modemmanager;\n\nNow, to send a USSD code for balance query to the network (say, *901#) and display the result, you would use this command:\natinout - /dev/ttyUSB1 - < <(echo \"AT+CUSD=1,\\\"*901#\\\",15\") && sleep 4 && \\\natinout - /dev/ttyUSB1 - < <(echo \"AT\");\n\nThis assumes that your modem is at /dev/ttyUSB1. The AT command in the second atinout command is just to get the unsolicited USSD answer displayed as a side effect, which should have arrived after the sleep.\nFor the case that querying your balance requires operating a USSD menu: this is also possible with atinout, see this answer.\n\nA: You can use the mmcli command line client of Ubuntu's default ModemManager to send a USSD code and get the reply:\n\n\n*\n\n*Start by listing your modems: mmcli -L. This will show a modem device path like /org/freedesktop/ModemManager1/Modem/0. The number at the end is the modem index, remember it.\n\n*Enable the modem (assuming your modem index is 0): mmcli -m 0 -e\n\n*Send the USSD request and display the answer. Assuming your network operator's USSD code to obtain the balance is *901#, the command would be:\nmmcli -m 0 --3gpp-ussd-initiate=\"*901#\"\n\nFor the case that querying your balance requires operating a USSD menu: this is also possible with mmcli, see this answer.\n\nA: You can use the Linux command line tool gsm-ussd to send USSD codes, get answers, and even navigate USSD menus (though that was not stable / usable for me).\nFor detailed installation and configuration instructions see here. The version 0.4 Debian package offered there for installation is the latest dev branch version.\nIf the USSD code to get your balance is (say) *901# and your modem is /dev/ttyUSB1 you would execute this to send a simple USSD code and display the network's answer (not resulting in a menu):\ngsm-ussd -m /dev/ttyUSB1 \"*901#\"\n\n\nA: For me, both ModemManager-based solutions and gammu don't work correctly with the multiline USSD response; e.g. my operator has a USSD command *104#, to which it responds something like:\nYou have:\n2.07 GB of traffic, valid until N\n47 minutes\n\nIt's disappointing to see just the first useless line: You have:.\nFinally I found a workaround with picocom and manual AT command. So every time I want to check my balance, I have to do the following:\nFirst, stop Modem Manager:\n$ sudo stop modemmanager\n\nNow, you need to know your modem port; in my case, it is /dev/ttyACM0.\nIf you don't know your port, try this:\nfor n in `ls /sys/class/*/*{ACM,wdm}*/device/interface`;do echo $(echo $n|awk -F '/' '{print $5}') : $(cat $n);done\n\nAnd look for the entry with Mobile Broadband Modem. E.g. my output looks as follows:\nttyACM0 : F5521gw Mobile Broadband Modem\nttyACM1 : F5521gw Mobile Broadband Data Modem\nttyACM2 : F5521gw Mobile Broadband GPS Port\ncdc-wdm0 : F5521gw Mobile Broadband Device Management\ncdc-wdm1 : F5521gw Mobile Broadband USIM Port\n\nFor more information on getting the right port, see this link: https://gist.github.com/heyalexej/cc6c97b1ea42736b3ff7\nThen, use picocom to connect to your port:\n$ sudo picocom /dev/ttyACM0\n\nYou should see something like this:\npicocom v1.7\n\nport is        : /dev/ttyACM0\nflowcontrol    : none\nbaudrate is    : 9600\nparity is      : none\ndatabits are   : 8\nescape is      : C-a\nlocal echo is  : no\nnoinit is      : no\nnoreset is     : no\nnolock is      : no\nsend_cmd is    : sz -vv\nreceive_cmd is : rz -vv\nimap is        : \nomap is        : \nemap is        : crcrlf,delbs,\n\nTerminal ready\n\n*EMRDY: 1\n\n(if you don't see this *EMRDY: 1, it probably means that you haven't stopped Modem Manager, see above)\nThen enter:\nAT+CUSD=1,\"*104#\"\n\nAnd after several seconds, you should get your reply, which can be multiline:\n+CUSD: 0,\"You have:\n2.07 GB of traffic, valid until N\n47 minutes\n\n\",15\n\nOK\n\nTo exit picocom, use Ctrl-A Ctrl-X\nAnd start modem manager again:\n$ sudo start modemmanager\n\n\nA: You can use the open source virtual PBX solution FreeSwitch together with its extension GSMopen to send USSD commands [source].\nFor example, if the USSD code to get your balance is (say) *901#, you would execute:\nchat SMS|interface3|ussd|*901#\n\nThere are simpler solutions in the other answers of course, but in case you use GSMopen anyway (… for example because it's the only way to do GSM voice calls under Linux …).\n", "Q: Delete Fedora, install Ubuntu, keep Windows I installed fedora (version 17 beta) some time ago, but I don't like it.

I don't have the windows installation cd.\nDuring ubuntu installation I don't know what to do with fedora partitions.\nCan I delete them in windows? Won't that also delete grub?

I am not trying to modify my system.  I am creating a bootable USB drive.  I don't understand why modifying a thumb drive would require administrator privileges.\n\nA: Because the system policy for usb-creator-gtk is set up like that. See the /usr/share/polkit-1/actions/com.ubuntu.usbcreator.policy file and the /var/lib/polkit-1/localauthority/10-vendor.d/com.ubuntu.desktop.pkla file. Why? I don't know, maybe the usb-creator code is not safe enough, and the program can be used even to modify internal drives. Maybe it is safe, but the creators don't want to risk it, so they chose not to allow modifications without privileges.\nIf you don't like that, you can override it (of course that process will require root privileges).\n", "Q: NVIDIA GT220 Ubuntu 12.04 LTS I'm new to Linux/Ubuntu all together.

I restarted into try ubuntu and wanted to install it. When I came to the installation type option it showed me two options: Erase disk and install ubuntu or something else.\nI chose something else, but when I did it only showed me my C drive as 500gb free space. The 10gb which I unallocated was not shown there.\nI want to know if I continue with partitioning my C drive (which has windows 8 on it), will that erase anything on that drive? What will it do, and why is the installation not showing the 10gb that I've unallocated? Please help!\n\nA: First, there's no such thing as a \"partition... which is... unallocated space.\" A partition is, by definition, allocated space. If you deleted or shrank a partition, the result is unallocated space. Although I believe I understand your meaning in this case, miscommunication on this score can lead to a lot of wasted effort as two parties communicate at cross purposes.\nSecond, although it's OK to shrink partitions in Windows in preparation for installing Linux, you should never create a partition using the Windows tools with the intention of using it in Linux. Doing so may work if you're lucky, but if you're not lucky, Windows will implement its proprietary Logical Disk Manager (LDM) system, and you'll have to jump through hoops to undo this change before you can install Linux. I don't believe this accounts for your problem, but it bears mentioning.\nMy suspicion is that you're using an older Master Boot Record (MBR) partitioning scheme and have run into a partition table difficulty. There are several things that can cause this type of problem. Many of them can be fixed with my FixParts program. See its documentation, and this page I've written on the topic. If you still have problems, post back with more detail, such as the output of the following commands, typed in a Linux terminal from an emergency disc:\nfdisk -l /dev/sda\nparted /dev/sda print\ngdisk -l /dev/sda\n\nIf you use Ubuntu, precede each of those commands by sudo; with other emergency discs or distributions, be sure you log in as root. (Logging in as root is standard with most Linux emergency discs.) If you use Ubuntu, you'll probably have to install gdisk by typing sudo apt-get install gdisk, too.

I took troubleshooting to fix overheating by installing Jupiter and TLP. \nGraphics errors like scrolling up by two-finger gesture opens and closes the dash quickly until it crashes, these were more of a problem I had run some command I now don't remember to activate my NVIDIA card, which since 13.04, only the Intel one works. \nRecently, I installed Compiz Config Manager and enabled unity improvements and they worked flawlessly for a week. Today while playing music and switching a work space, the graphics could not keep up and it crashed. Also when I shut my laptop lid instead of locking the screen, it turned black and never returned. \nAny recommendations?\n\nA: I got it to work be uninstalling Compiz Config Settings Manager, deleting the Ubuntu partitions and installing Ubuntu 13.10, and installing Cpufreq Indicator and setting it to Powersave.\n", "Q: Hp Deskjet 1010 printers drivers for ubuntu 12.04 I can't installs drivers from Hp site.

The steps required depends on the operating system you want to burn it on.\n\nA: Yes!\nUbuntu is DRM Free since it is Mostly Open Source!\n", "Q: Can I restore GPT info from MBR ? I had a problem where my ubuntu installer would not recognize my windows partition, so i looked it up, and someone suggested 'zapping' GPT from my hdd with sudo gdisc /dev/sdb followed by x, z, y, n. (expert mode, zap gpt, yes to remove gpt, no to wipe MBR).\nThis, it was explained would fix my problem, but saying no to wiping MBR would mean my windows partition wasn't lost. Which then turned out not to be the case, so I'm not finding my OS anymore, and being a retard i didn't do any backups or anything like that. Is all hope lost for me? Or is there some way to restore the GP tables ?\nI'm pretty horrible with partitions.\n\nA: Your best bet is to run TestDisk on your system. It searches for filesystem information and can create fresh partition table entries for any filesystem(s) it finds. This is most likely to work easily if the disk hasn't been significantly repartitioned, though -- if you've repeatedly resized, moved, or created new partitions, leftover fragments of old partitions may confuse TestDisk. Even if you've done this, though, it's worth trying. I believe that TestDisk is available in the Ubuntu testdisk package, so you should be able to install and use it from an Ubuntu live CD.\n", "Q: I cannot access Thunderbird ppa I tried the suggestion given to this question:\nThunderbird won't send email\nbut apt gave the following error:\nCannot access PPA (https://launchpad.net/api/1.0/~mozillateam/+archive/thunderbird-stable) to get PPA information, please check your internet connection.\nOf course, because I can post this, my internet connection is fine. Any suggestions? \nUbuntu 12.04 LTS.\nThanks.\n\nA: That PPA seems to no longer exist, see here.\nThat other answer you linked to basically suggested installing the newest stable version of Thunderbird, which may have been more up-to-date than the latest stable version in the official repos at that time. But apparently, now the thunderbird package is updated often enough in the official repos.\nAlong the lines of the idea suggested in that other thread, if you have a similar problem and want try upgrading Thunderbird to solve it, you may try the Thunderbird Beta PPA:\nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:mozillateam/thunderbird-next\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get install thunderbird\n\nBe aware that this will install a beta version of thunderbird, with a higher potential for bugs.\n", "Q: SSH and Telnet Connection refused If I am trying to ssh or telnet to an Ubuntu Server, and both connections are rejected or refused!\nI can ping the server, firewall off.\nWhat are troubleshooting steps should I take?\n(I am far away from the Server, so console solution isn't available).\n\nA: You can determine if programs on the server are listening to the ssh and telnet ports (22 and 23, usually), by:  \nnmap -T4 -A -v -PE -PS22,23 -PA22,23 <ServerIP>  \n\nor,  \ntelnet <ServerIP> 22  \ntelnet <ServerIP> 23  \n\nIf your error message is: telnet: Unable to connect to remote host: Connection refused the problem is on the remote server (no program is listening to that port).

I have the Live CD. Can someone please help me with this issue ?\n\nA: When you are running the Ubuntu 13.10 DvD/USB, open a program called Gparted.\nYou can use this program to edit partitions on your hard drive. Back up any files you need from your E: partition because this will delete everything on it. If E: is a separate hard drive, you need to select it in Gparted by changing the drive in the scroll down selector in the top right.\nTo make the partition that you want to use available to Ubuntu, you need to format it to ext4. You also need to make a partition for swap. If you already have four partitions on the drive, you need to create a logical partition to hold these two partitions.\nDelete the partition you want to use for Ubuntu by right clicking it in the rectangle viewer area and selecting 'Delete'. Now right click in the newly created empty area and select 'New'. If you need a logical partition, create it first by keeping the size the same and selecting logical in the partition type. First, you should make a partition that is for swap. Make it the same size as your RAM, 1024 x # of GB and leave all empty space to the left of it. The format will be called \"Linux-swap\". Now create another partition for Ubuntu; it will need ext4 format. When you are done hit the apply button (green check mark).\nNow start the installer. When you get to selecting how to install Ubuntu, select \"something else\". In this screen, select the ext4 partition you just made and right click it, then select 'change'. Set the mount point as \"/\" and select ext4 in the drop down selection.\nMake sure your boot loader is selecting the correct drive at the bottom of this window. If you have Windows on sda then the boot loader needs to be on sda; even if you are installing Ubuntu on a different drive.\nThis should set you up with a dual-boot with Ubuntu and Windows 7.\n", "Q: How can I watch videos online? what app do i need to download in order to watch video's online?

I have the iso downloaded from unetbootin on my flashdrive and my boot sequence changed in my bios settings, but every time I boot up ubuntu, I get a purple screen and then I get a black screen and I can type words, numbers, etc on it. \n\nA: A lot of people report problems when trying to use Universal.\nTry UNetbootin or Startup Disk Creator, (from the Live DVD).\n", "Q: Tunnel a whole desktop over ssh to X11 running on OSX My main workstation is OSX (as I spend a lot of time developing iOS and OSX software), however I use Ubuntu for a bunch of things. \nI've got Ubuntu running on another machine, and would like to tunnel the desktop over ssh to OSX.

Instead I want to go to https://apps.ubuntu.com search for the software then download and install it later like Windows.\nSo, how to download software from Ubuntu app directory?\n\nA: Ubuntu contrary to Windows, doesn't have installer for most of the software but package. The packages are installed along with dependencies in a orderly fashion (A depends of B, hence B gets installed first, then I can install A) that are contrary to windows behavior of \"a installer that includes all\".

I have installed PyCharm on my brand new Ubuntu 13.10 laptop.\nTo launch PyCharm, I find I must navigate to the directory that pycharm lives in, and execute it from there as such:\ncd home/matt/software/pycharm/bin sh pycharm.sh\n\nI hope this isn't asking too much, but I would like to be able to click on an icon in the Launcher to launch this application.\nI tried right-clicking on the PyCharm icon in the Launcher when the app is running and selecting \"Lock To Launcher\" but this doesn't work (after pinning, when I try to run the software this way, the icon throbs in a very awkward manner a few times and does nothing).\nA small app called Alacart was rumoured to be useful, but I have no idea how it works, and it appears useless.  I'm not sure why the authors teased us with a \"Help\" button if there are no help files written for us to view.\nFurther attempt has included reading page after page of technical documentation on how to write scripts that will somehow help me customize my experience.\nHow can I set up PyCharm to launch from the Launcher???\n\nA: I had the same problem after \"Create Desktop Entry...\".\nThis is what solved my problem:\nGo to the bin folder of the PyCharm and add following line to the beginning of pycharm.sh script:\nexport JDK_HOME='your java home folder'\n\nand save the file. Now, run the launcher entry from Unity.\n\nA: PyCharm can create it's own launcher icon (but it's not created by default). \nAll you have to do is:\n\n\n*\n\n*Start PyCharm.\n\n*From the Tools menu, select \"Create Desktop Entry...\"\n\n*Tick the corresponding box if you want the launcher for all users.\n\n*If you selected \"Create entry for all users\", you will be asked for your password.\n\n*A green message bubble should appear informing you that it was successful.\n\n*You should then be able to find PyCharm in the Unity Dash or pin it to the launcher.\n\n\nNote: You may need a system restart before it appears.\n\nA: The \"purest\" method, in my opinion, is to simply create a launcher in a text editor that looks about like this:\n[Desktop Entry]\nVersion=1.0\nType=Application\nName=PyCharm\nIcon=/opt/pycharm-2017.1.1/bin/pycharm.png\nExec=\"/opt/pycharm-2017.1.1/bin/pycharm.sh\" %f\nComment=The Drive to Develop\nCategories=Development;IDE;\nTerminal=false\nStartupWMClass=jetbrains-pycharm\n\nI believe this one was created by JetBrains, but you can type your own. Then save it to /home/yourname/.local/share/applications/appname.desktop for a launcher tied to your own login, or to /usr/share/applications/appname.desktop if you want it to apply to other users of your system.\nObviously, once editing, you can modify the icon, etc. And you can transfer this skill to other apps or tasks.\n\nA: There is a program called \"main menu\" available from the software centre. It allows you to make launchers for any command.\nAlso you need to run the cd and the launch as one command like this:\nsh -c \"cd /folder/to/go/to  && launch-command -options\"\n\nClick new item\n\nEnter a name for the launcher and the command, and maybe a picture\n\n\nA: Assuming default Gnome WM, with the PyCharm Application open, right click on the dock icon. Choose \"Add to Favorites\" option. \n\n\nA: The PyCharm installation may come with a desktop file. This file can be copied to a working location. For example:\ncp -v /snap/pycharm-community/current/meta/gui/pycharm-community.desktop ~/.local/share/applications\n\nAfter copying this file, a working entry for PyCharm will be listed when you search for pycharm in \"Show Launcher\".\n", "Q: maas nodes login incorrect I'm testing Ubuntu12.04 MAAS with juju ,i installed the maas server and add 2 nodes \nnow the nodes allocated to admin user when i start them login is required i tried the admin username and password but always got error \"login incorrect\" any one can help me please \n\nA: juju ssh <machine-id>\n\n...is easiest , and:\nssh ubuntu@<host>\n\n...is roughly equivalent. You'll always need to log in as the ubuntu user, and you'll need to authenticate with one of the private keys (id_dsa, id_rsa, or identity) in your ~/.ssh directory.\n(When you bootstrapped, juju will have looked in ~/.ssh and automatically chosen one of id_dsa.pub, id_rsa.pub and identity.pub to authorize for all machines; if necessary, you can override this behaviour by setting authorized-keys-path in your environment configuration, but you may need to do more work to configure ssh to use the appropriate private keys.)\n", "Q: How do I install a perl module in Ubuntu 12.04?

However, they require some gconf / dconf settings to be set.\nFor instance to set the correct icon theme:\n$ gconftool-2 --set --type string /desktop/gnome/interface/icon_theme Faenza\n\nWhen running Gnome, these settings are loaded and used by the Qt apps. However, when running native Openbox, these settings are ignored and I presume that this is due to some gconf / dconf services not being loaded when running Openbox without Gnome. \nTherefore my question, how can I run gconf / dconf without Gnome to have my Qt apps having access to the relevant gconf / dconf settings? \n\nA: I am not entirely sure if this is all but I have compared my Gnome environment with Openbox and found the following additional processes to be started by Gnome:\ngsettings-data-convert &\n/usr/lib/Gconf/gconfd-2 &\n/usr/lib/dconf/dconf-service &\n\nIn addition it might help to export the following variables:\nexport DE=gnome\nexport DESKTOP_SESSION=gnome\n\n", "Q: Using windows drivers in Wine Can Wine be used to overcome printer driver problems?

Is there a way to do this automatic or even a manual way to slow the CPU down from ubuntu\n\nA: I created a program just for this problem. Limit your CPU based on a desired temperature. It runs like this:\nsudo ./temp_throttle.sh 80\n\nThat command will make your CPU cores slow down when they reach 80 degrees Celsius. When the temperature goes down, the CPU cores will be allowed to run faster again. You can find temp_throttle here.\n\nTo run the main script at startup with sudo and enter the password in gnome-terminal, one could create a small script  :\n#!/bin/bash\n\ncd \"/path/to/the/directory/temp-throttle-stable/\"\ngnome-terminal -e 'sudo ./temp_throttle.sh 80' --geometry=45x15 --hide-menubar --profile=hold  \n\n(--geometry=45x15 opens a small terminal screen; --profile=hold uses a gnome-terminal profile called \"hold\" that has to be already created with the option \"When command exits: Hold the terminal open\", --hide-menubar hides the menus for that window)\nAfter making it executable, this small script (let's call it temp_throttle_80.sh) can then be added to the startup list and you'll be prompted to enter password at startup; then, if the mentioned temperature is reached, its action is reported:\n\n\nA: Intel Ubuntu 16.04+ solution for Sandy Bridge and newer processors\nFrom (wiki.debian.org -thermald) there is Debian's (Ubuntu's) write up about thermald  A Linux daemon for cooling tablets and laptops. This only works for Sandy Bridge (2nd generation) and newer Intel Cores. Once the system temperature reaches a certain threshold, the Linux daemon activates various cooling methods to try to cool the system.\nLinux thermal daemon (thermald) monitors and controls temperature in laptops, tablets PC with the latest Intel sandy bridge and latest Intel CPU releases. Once the system temperature reaches a certain threshold, the Linux daemon activates various cooling methods to try to cool the system.\nIt operates in two modes:\nZero Configuration Mode\n\n\n*\n\n*For most users, this should be enough to bring the CPU temperature of the system under control. This uses DTS temperature sensor and uses Intel P state driver, Power clamp driver, Running Average Power Limit control and cpufreq as cooling methods.\n\n\nUser defined configuration mode\n\n\n*\n\n*This allows ACPI style configuration in a thermal XML configuration file. This can be used to fix the buggy ACPI configuration or fine tune by adding more sensors and cooling devices. This is a first step in implementing a close loop thermal control in user mode and can be enhanced based on community feedback and suggestions.\n\n\nHow to install\napt-get install thermald\n\n\nTLP\nFrom Arch Linux:\n\nTLP brings you the benefits of advanced power management for Linux\n  without the need to understand every technical detail. TLP comes with\n  a default configuration already optimized for battery life, so you may\n  just install and forget it. Nevertheless TLP is highly customizable to\n  fulfill your specific requirements.\n\nPlease read the full Arch Linux TLP link above. There are issues with Nvidia that require configuration changes.\nAfter many trials and errors with other packages, I've had great success using TLP. It gives superior fan control and works seamlessly with thermald and p-states.\nAs these installation instructions for Ubuntu 15.04+ mention TLP not only reduces overheating but it extends battery life too.\nSince installing TLP, Powerclamp (described below) has never been invoked again.\n\nIntel Powerclamp\nIntel's Powerclamp driver is defined here (kernel.org - Intel Power Clamp.txt) and is part of thermald described above. A direct quote for Powerclamp from the link:\n\nConsider the situation where a system’s power consumption must be\n  reduced at runtime, due to power budget, thermal constraint, or noise\n  level, and where active cooling is not preferred. Software managed\n  passive power reduction must be performed to prevent the hardware\n  actions that are designed for catastrophic scenarios.\nCurrently, P-states, T-states (clock modulation), and CPU offlining\n  are used for CPU throttling.\nOn Intel CPUs, C-states provide effective power reduction, but so far\n  they’re only used opportunistically, based on workload. With the\n  development of intel_powerclamp driver, the method of synchronizing\n  idle injection across all online CPU threads was introduced. The goal\n  is to achieve forced and controllable C-state residency.\nTest/Analysis has been made in the areas of power, performance,\n  scalability, and user experience. In many cases, clear advantage is\n  shown over taking the CPU offline or modulating the CPU clock.\n\n\nHow do you know Powerclamp is running?\nPowerclamp might only show itself once a year when your fan vents get too much dust & lint. So how do you know it's actually running in the background? Use:\nlsmod | grep intel\n\nAnd you should see a list similar to this:\nbtintel                16384  1 btusb\nbluetooth             520192  29 bnep,btbcm,btrtl,btusb,rfcomm,btintel\nintel_rapl             20480  0\nintel_powerclamp       16384  0\n   (.... more intel drivers ....)\nsnd                    81920  18 snd_hwdep,snd_timer,snd_hda_codec_hdmi,snd_hda_codec_idt,snd_pcm,snd_seq,snd_rawmidi,snd_hda_codec_generic,snd_hda_codec,snd_hda_intel,snd_seq_device\n\nIf you see intel_rapl and intel_powerclamp you know it's working and simply waiting temps to exceed 85C.\n\nPowerclamp in action displayed by Conky\nHere is a screen shot when Powerclamp injects sleep cycles:\n\nNormally on this system CPU clock speed is 2400 Mhz to 3400 Mhz when watching HTML5 video and 10 Chrome tabs open. Normally CPU utilization is about 9% to 12% across 8 CPUs. When things get too hot (86C) Powerclamp kicks in and this happens:\n\n\n*\n\n*CPU speed is reduced to 1200 Mhz. \n\n*CPU utilization spikes up to 80%. This is misleading because the extra 70% is sleeping time.\n\n*The top 9 CPU processes are usually 5 or 6 Chrome processes plus Xorg, Conky, Pulse Audio and an occasional kworker. However now 8 of the top 10 are the kidle_inject/x process where x is from 0 to 7. For the first 8 CPUs.\n\n\nThe Powerclamp driver runs until temps drop below 85C again. While the driver is running you might have split second pausing in your videos and possibly split second keyboard and mouse lag.\n\nDisable Intel Turbo Boost\nBack in the \"cool old days\" of Ubuntu 14.04 Intel Turbo Boost was broken so my processor speed fluctuated between 1200 Mhz and 2400 Mhz. After upgrade to Ubuntu 16.04 it would go up to 3400 Mhz (3.4 Ghz) because Turbo Boost was finally working. But it also raised the heat.\nTo disable Intel Turbo Boost use:\necho \"1\" | sudo tee /sys/devices/system/cpu/intel_pstate/no_turbo\n\n\nShort term fix in this scenario\nTo \"band-aid\" fix this problem I pulled the old laptop cooler pad with dual fans out of the closet and popped under the laptop. This dropped temps to 63C under the same workload.\nThe next step will be compress air in vents. After that the final step will be new Cooling Heatsink with pipes for CPU and GPU. Good thermal paste such as Arctic Silver 5 is also needed in that operation. A new fan was already installed last year and that seems to be running ok.\nUpdate Jan 25 2017\nBlew out fan vents with compressed air and temps dropped from 63C to 56C. This is still using the laptop cooling pad mind you.\nUpdate Aug 06 2017\nHave been using TLP (described above) for many months now and temperatures are steady around 50C and fan performance is optimal.\n\nWatch out for too many fan control drivers\nBecause this is a Dell I had installed I8K Fan Monitor / Control in hopes it would speed up the fan sooner and faster. When I type sensors I get:\n$ sensors\ndell_smm-virtual-0\nAdapter: Virtual device\nProcessor Fan: 3963 RPM\nCPU:            +63.0°C  \nAmbient:        +49.0°C  \nGPU:            +54.0°C  \nOther:          +79.0°C  \n\nacpitz-virtual-0\nAdapter: Virtual device\ntemp1:        +27.8°C  (crit = +106.0°C)\ntemp2:        +29.8°C  (crit = +106.0°C)\n\ncoretemp-isa-0000\nAdapter: ISA adapter\nPhysical id 0:  +65.0°C  (high = +87.0°C, crit = +105.0°C)\nCore 0:         +65.0°C  (high = +87.0°C, crit = +105.0°C)\nCore 1:         +64.0°C  (high = +87.0°C, crit = +105.0°C)\nCore 2:         +63.0°C  (high = +87.0°C, crit = +105.0°C)\nCore 3:         +57.0°C  (high = +87.0°C, crit = +105.0°C)\n\nIgnore the virtual temps, they are out to lunch. Under Ubuntu 14.04 the were accurate and I used temp 1 in Conky display. After Ubuntu 16.04 upgrade I had to refer to a third temperature not displayed on this screen. To see the REAL temps you can use this command:\n$ cat /sys/class/thermal/thermal_zone*/temp\n27800\n29800\n62000\n\nWhen I type:\n$ lsmod |grep dell\ndell_wmi               16384  0\nsparse_keymap          16384  1 dell_wmi\ndell_laptop            20480  0\ndell_smbios            16384  2 dell_wmi,dell_laptop\ndcdbas                 16384  1 dell_smbios\ndell_smm_hwmon         16384  0\nwmi                    16384  1 dell_wmi\nvideo                  40960  3 dell_wmi,dell_laptop,i915\n\nI see the dell_smm_hwmon kernel module / driver. When I google that driver and I8K people report the two drivers cause system freezes for a split-second every 10 seconds or so. I was having this problem myself so had to remove I8K fan control.\nThere are lots of other utilities and cooling methodologies but this is getting TL;DR.\n\nA: you can limit the CPU frequency , so that you can low down the frequency and it can control the Heat from CPU. \ncpufreq-selector -f <mention the frq u want in the Khz>\n\n", "Q: No WiFi in 12.04 new install I am a newbie who has just installed 12.04 in my Intel I3-550 home built computer.

I tried GPT, but there were a lot of issues.\nNow, I am unable to boot from Ubuntu USB in Legacy BIOS so I booted in UEFI mode.\nWhen I am trying to install Ubuntu and select manual partition, should I install it in /dev/sda or /dev/sda1 (which is a small ext4 partition I had reserved for boot.)\nI cannot designate the partition as boot, only efi boot option is available.\nIf  I install Ubuntu to the efi boot partition , will windows keep working ?\n\nA: Some EFIs support switching between BIOS/CSM/legacy-mode and EFI/UEFI-mode booting in their boot managers. This is a bit awkward, because it usually requires pressing Esc or a function key during a very brief window of time early in the boot process, but it can work acceptably for some people.\nIf that's not an option, you might try my rEFInd boot manager. Try the USB flash drive version first; you can try it without writing anything to disk, then if it works, install it to your hard disk. You'll need to edit the refind.conf file, though: Uncomment the scanfor option and ensure that hdbios is among the options. This will tell rEFInd to scan for BIOS-mode boot options and present any that it finds on its menu. (The default on PCs is to ignore BIOS/CSM/legacy boot options.) Using rEFInd in this way works on many new PCs, but it's not guaranteed to work; some EFIs lack the necessary features, and systems with multiple hard disks don't always work correctly when booting in this way.\n", "Q: Run X11 GUI application from browser (apache - php) The same way as https://askubuntu.com/questions/364458/running-gui-app-with-php, I need to run a X11 application (VLC) from a php page on Apache server.\nI need to open the VLC application on the server, not on the remote system.\nI'm trying to get this through a php shell_exec call to a shell script containing the VLC commands.\nThe sh script correctly opens the VLC app if launched from command line, but not through the php call, because it does not find (I think) any X11 session initiated: it returns related error messages:\n  - inhibit interface error: Failed to connect to the D-Bus session daemon: //bin/dbus-launch terminated abnormally with the following error: No protocol specified\n  - Autolaunch error: X11 initialization failed.\n  - main interface error: no suitable interface module\n  - xcb_xv vout display error: parent window not available\n  - ...\n\nIf I grant the apache user, www-data, to connect to the X server\nxhost +local:www-data\n\nit works for the video but not for audio; the windows opens and plays the video but without sound and still other error messages related to audio server... \nexport DISPLAY=:0 does not seem to have any effect.\nAny help would be appreciated.\n\nA: There's an X server running on the same computer as PHP?

In order to run the svn updates in a cronjob, but with your user, try using the -u option.\nsudo -u yourusername svn update\n\n\nA: This is a fairly simple one...\nsudo svn update\nWHHHYY?!!?!!\nI'm not sure I need to say anything else but just to bulk out the answer a bit more... Running as sudo means you're running as root. Which means your local ~/.ssh/  configuration counts for zip.\nIt also means that all the files created are owned by root. Uneditable by your user. And this is why (repeat this bit out aloud) we never use sudo with subversion. It's unneccessary and it's harmful.\nTo fix this, I'd suggest wiping out your local copy (as long as you have a backup) and then checking out a new copy as your user. And in your crontab, just omit the sudo.\n\nA: The problem is that since you use sudo, the svn update command is executed as root, so the ~/.ssh directory of your normal user is not taken into account.\nIf you have to do the svn update as root, then you should also perform the steps 1 and 2 that you described as root, i.e., with sudo. But only do this id you are very aware of what you are doing.\nIf it is possible for you to do all those svn updates as a normal user, that would be a much better way. In that case, simply remove the sudo and only execute the command svn update as a cronjob. Additionally, you will also have to run the cronjob as a normal user. Refer to this answer here to learn how to execute cronjobs as a normal user:\nhttps://superuser.com/questions/170866/how-to-run-a-cron-job-as-a-specific-user\nIn you case, you would probably want something like this in /etc/crontab:\n 00 */3   * * *   yourusername   cd /some/path/ && svn update\n\nReplace yourusername with the username of the user that generated the SSH keypair and copied the public key to test@repo.test.in, and /some/path/ with the path to your local copy of the svn repo you want to check out.\n", "Q: changing /etc/environment did not affect my environment variables I'm trying to install Euler expert system following these instructions.

I've recently changed my laptop to a much powerful one and i'm wondering how can i tweak ubuntu to use all the hardware power to speed up system.\nMy Previous laptop was a i3 Sony Vaio, And my current laptop is a i7 Toshoba with 16 GB of ram.\nSpecs are:\n\n*\n\n*Intel® Core™ i7-4700MQ Processor\n\n*16GB DDR3L 1600MHz memory\n\n*1.0TB (5400 RPM, Serial ATA)\n\n*Mobile Intel® HD Graphics\n\n‌Based on my experience with my old laptop, i expected to gain a huge performance improvement with this much more powerful laptop. Actually ubuntu is fast enough but sometimes it takes time for a window to open up (Like System Settings), So is there anything to improve the performance ? (I know the obvious advise whould be to change HDD with an SSD one, but at the moment i'm a little short on money...)\nI did this tweaks already:\n\n*\n\n*I Installed Preload\n\n*Changed the value of Swappiness to 10\n\n*Installed zram-config (i don't know if it helps or not since my laptop has lots of ram)\n\n*Moved /tmp directory to RAM\nAlso there are few things that bother me:\n\n*\n\n*When i login to ubuntu, screen turns black for few seconds and then Desktop is shown\n\n*Function Keys on my laptop are reversed but in ubuntu i need to hold down FN to access those functions (i.e. F7 Key should Play/Pause music by default and to access actual F7 command, FN sholud be held down, but in ubuntu it's opposite)\n\n*Touchpad is Multi-Touch but i cant set 3-4 finger gestures even though i installed touchegg\n\n*Keyboard is backlit and FN+Z should turn light ON/Off, but it doesn't work under ubuntu\n\nAnd one thing else, the laptop has touch screen display, i don't really use this feature ( i even didn't know about it when i ordered), but is there any package or anything that lets ubuntu use this feature in a more specific way ?

All other optimizations will give you only measurable, but not sensible, perfomance boosts (apart from preload maybe). Your machine has more than enough power to work fluidly with ubuntu.\nYou should think the other way around, how to use this processing power reasonable? Lastly, there has to be a reason to buy a laptop with so much processing power.\nPS: \n\n\n*\n\n*The reason why your screen turns black after login for a few seconds, is due the fact that your hdd is preloading something.\n\n*Because you haven't posted your lsusb output, i assume that your touchpad is from synaptics.

I'm running into a couple of issues, and one of the possible solutions I've found requires editing a file called usr/bin/chromeos.

However, I get this response:\n$ /usr/bin/chromeos\nbash: /usr/bin/chromeos: No such file or directory\n\nWhat can I do? I think I've had this happen before when trying to edit other files like this.

Only root and users in the dialout group may access that device.\nIf you are running chirp as a normal user (I assume you are), the problem is probably quite simply that your user does not belong to the dialout group.

This morning I downloaded a video to my Downloads folder using Deluge. Later when I wanted to watch the movie I opened Files, then clicked on Downloads... and Files closed itself straight away. \nI once again clicked Files, but instead of clicking on Downloads I clicked on the other folders like Documents and Pictures. They opened fine. But seconds after I clicked and opened Downloads it closes Files completely. \nI am totally baffled by this. I opened Files again, right-clicked on Downloads and ran a virus scan with ClamTK on Downloads. There is/was something like 10 files in there, and a virus did pop up, something like .phishing.bank or something. I quarantined it, but the problem still persist. \nOn Askubuntu I searched everywhere, also Googled for a solution. The nearest page describing my problem is at https://askubuntu.com/questions/249457/nautilus-closes-immediately-when-i-click-on-folder-desktop-empty, but there's no solution there even for an older version than my Ubuntu 13.10.\nI tried everything else I could think of. I did restart the computer, I even used the search function to get the video, then moved the video from there to a Windows folder (I'm running Ubuntu next to Windows 7 Ultimate) and then I deleted the movie's folder in Downloads while still in the search bar.\nBut when opening Files again, then clicking Downloads, it only opens for a few secons allowing me to see what is inside before it closes Files (or File Manager, what is the right name?) again.\nI tried clicking 'Downloads' on the left-hand pane (the grey one) as well as the right-hand (white/pink) pane, same story. Updates are up to date. Using Ubuntu 13.10.\nAnyone that wants to share my baffle and come of with a brilliant easy to understand solution? :)\nOh, I just remember: Yesterday evening I 'cut' most of the files (not all) in Ubuntu Downloads, and pasted them in Windows Downloads because my space on the Ubuntu side is only 30 Gb. When I checked Downloads 30 minutes ago (for the few seconds before it closed itself again) those files are still showing in Ubuntu Downloads, but all of them 0 kb in size. And when I checked just now, they showed with their original file sizes again!\nYesterday evening I also changed the default grid view that files and folders are shown in, to 'tree view' after I discovered 'File Preferences'. Right now I opened 'files'>Preferences again and changed it back to grid view. But a minute later I opened Preferences again and change it back to list view... but after closing the settings panel it stayed in grid view even though it should've shown files in list view. So I closed Files and re-open it again, just to see it is now in List View again. \nDownloads on the Windows-side works fine, it is only Ubuntu's Downloads' folder that are playing ghost-ghost with me. \n2.)  Another thing: Ant Video Downloader suddenly stopped working yesterday afternoon, saying something about a Java/javascript error when I tried to download a video that it detected at YouTube. So I installed something about/from Java at Ubuntu Software Center (can't remember the name, and don't know where to look for it, I'm newbie remember, all that I know is it got good stars and reviews there and is not from Oracle), but that did not solve the Ant-problem. Can this be related to the Downloads-problem I'm having?\n3.) I was looking for a trouble-shooter program similar to SlimCleaner this morning, but couldn't find one yet. Any suggestions?\nI would really appreciate some help, especially with the Downloads-issue.\n-Gunther\n\nA: I have been having the same problem with File Manager closing after trying to open the Downloads directory.

The script is not being run at shutdown, which is what I want.  The script is just to test if I could run a script at shutdown; I supply the code in shutdown_script below:\n#!/bin/sh\n#\n# Tests script to run at shutdown.\n# Script creates a fil and writes to it. \n#\n# Usage: ./shutdown-script\n\ntouch $HOME/shutdown.log\necho \"Shutting down at `date` ...\" >> $HOME/shutdown.log\n\nAs you can see, it just adds a file to the home folder showing the current date and time.\nPlease could you tell me what I may be doing wrong, and more importantly, how to get a script to run at shutdown.\n\nA: In principle what you are doing is correct. My guess is you may be looking in the wrong place for that shutdown.log file you are trying to create. Since these scripts will be executed at shutdown by root, the variable $HOME will not point to your usual home directory. See if /root/shutdown.log has been created, or supply an absolute path in your script without the $HOME variable.\n", "Q: Which partition can I delete? I currently have a machine running Windows 7 on it and would like to set up a dual boot with Ubuntu (14.03). The computer is an all-in-one and therefore came preassembled and preinstalled with the OS. It also has 4 partitions: 1 System partition (I think Windows creates this upon installation automatically), 1 Boot partition on which the main part of my OS resides, one Recover partition (20GB) and one OEM partition (I think this might have been created by the manuacturer of the HDD). I also shrunk my Boot partition and created some unallocated space to install Ubuntu in. Now as I understand it, I will not be able to install Ubuntu with 4 (primary?) partitions already on my system. I don't know if the OEM partition for example could be removed without causing damage so that I can install Ubuntu. Also one quick question to the installation itself: Should I choose install alongside Windows? Will Ubuntu automatically install in the unallocated space if I do that? Any advice is greatly appreciated!\n\nA: The OEM partition will be too small. to gain you enough space and if they are ordered in the way you say deleting it will be of little use unless you the move the recovery partition, moving partition does not always work. The OEM partition contains all your windows installers, so it is good to back this up onto a DVD.\nYou should be able just run the install on the live CD and it will give you the side by side option where it will shrink the windows partition and then create an extended one for windows. Shrinking partitions can cause data loss (I have never had a problem myself) so backing up is a good idea.\n", "Q: Permissions - Listing uid Two part question:\n\n\n*\n\n*What is a world-writeable directory and file?\n\n*I'm looking for a script that would display the directories on all partitions of a server, that are not owned by root or a system account.  In our environment, all world-writable directories should be owned by root or another system account. \n\n\nA: *\n\n*world-writable files are files that anyone can write to. Regardless of who they are. This is considered a security issue where some random person on the other side of the world that has access to your system can abuse. Imagine some software that uses /tmp (=world-writeable by design) is also listening to incomming data in /tmp. \nThere is one extra thing though: sticky bit. The most common use of the sticky bit today is on directories. When the sticky bit is set, only the item's owner, the directory's owner, or the superuser can rename or delete files. Without the sticky bit set, any user with write and execute permissions for the directory can rename or delete contained files, regardless of owner. \n\n*This will print all world-writable files that do not have their sticky bit set. \nfind / -xdev -type d \\( -perm -0002 -a ! -perm -1000 \\) -print\n\nThis will also print all world writable files:\nfind / -perm -2 ! -type l -ls\n\n\nA: I think you want this script\n#!/bin/bash\nuids=`awk -F \":\" '{print $3}' /etc/passwd`\nfor i in $uids; do\n    if [ $i -gt 500 ]; then\n            find / -uid $i -perm -002 -type d 2>/dev/null\n    fi\ndone\n\nIt gets the uids from the passwd file, then loops through them, and if the uid is greater than 500 it will launch a find for directories with that uid and other writable bit set.\n", "Q: How do I change keyboard layout? My keyboard layout in Ubuntu doesn't fully correspond to my actual keyboard. This could be either because I chose the wrong option during the installation, or because my misguided attempts to fix the keyboard layout switcher that Ubuntu broke in 13.10, compared to 13.04.\nHere's what I see in Ubuntu keyboard layout chart:\n\nOn my keyboard there are Backspace instead of ], ) above 0 and [ instead of :. It says \"English (US)\", but doesn't look like one. Also, the keyboard in the chart has an L-shaped Enter key, so can't be \"English (US)\", but probably some European type. How do I change my keyboard layout to a proper one? Command line is ok.\nI am using English (US) and Russian layouts, between which I am switching with Ctrl+Shift. I managed to fix that bit, so that both Ctrl+Shift and the shortcuts that contain it (like Ctrl+Shift+Tab to switch browser tabs backwards,) do work.\nI am using Ubuntu 13.10 32-bit.\n\nA: The screenshot you've shown has numerous mistakes that don't match an actual layout, including an extra Escape key, misplaced Backspace, etc. Either you have loaded a custom layout unknowingly, or something is very wrong with your default English (US) layout. I recommend filing a bug report with Ubuntu, because what you are seeing should not be possible without very explicit (and misguided) customization.\nPS: The L-shaped enter key is not important. Keyboard layouts only care very slightly about the shape and width of specific keys.\n\nA: This is posted in a comment above, but given that I had the very same layout issue:\nIt was fixed by installing gnome-tweak-tool and disabling the \"Japanese keyboard options\" under typing.\nRunning:\n$ setxkbmap -print\nxkb_keymap {\nxkb_keycodes { include \"evdev+aliases(qwerty)\" };\nxkb_types { include \"complete\" };\nxkb_compat { include \"complete\" };\nxkb_symbols { include \"pc+us+inet(evdev)+jp(nicola_f_bs)\" };\nxkb_geometry { include \"pc(pc105)\" };\n};\n\nI could see that there were some japanese options set, but I couldn't find what file to disable them in.

I've just finished downloading Ubuntu for my C710 and rather than it being in Ubuntu it is still Chrome OS.\nHow do I install Ubuntu on a Chromebook?\n\nA: What Have you done after downloading the Ubuntu for your c710.\nMaybe you have to make a bootable USB-Stick and boot from it and install ubuntu.\nHow to make a bootable USB-Stick: How do you make USB bootable on chromebook\nHope this helps.\n\nA: Take a look here: http://lifehacker.com/how-to-install-linux-on-a-chromebook-and-unlock-its-ful-509039343. \nFrom the page:\n\nWe're going to use a tool called Crouton to install Ubuntu (hat tip to\n  our friends at the How-To Geek), which uses the chroot command to run\n  Ubuntu on top of Chrome OS, which is already based on Linux. Unlike\n  dual-booting, that means you can switch between Chrome OS and Ubuntu\n  with a quick keyboard shortcut, no reboots necessary, which is\n  awesome. It's speedy, powerful, and there only when you need it. If\n  you prefer a more traditional dual-boot environment, check out\n  ChrUbuntu instead, but we'll be using Crouton today.\n\nIt can be done, and is only logical, as Chrome OS is based on Linux, like Ubuntu.\nWhat it looks like your problem is you didn't set up dual-booting correctly, as Chromebooks work differently than regular computers for booting.\nIf you want to dual-boot, look here: http://liliputing.com/2012/11/how-to-install-ubuntu-12-04-on-the-199-acer-c7-chromebook.html. It gives instructions that are aimed at the Acer C7 using ChrUbuntu.\nShould solve your problem relatively ASAP :D!\nBest of Luck, will be following this. \nBTW, if you get it working, could you post something within the post or something like a Community Wiki with what you did? That would probably be greatly appreciated in the community!\n", "Q: File Manager PCManFM not the one as shown in USC I've installed Ubuntu 13.10, and also installed PCManFM from USC, but when I launched it, it didn't work as indicated in this page.\nIt works more like Files.

How can I merge the two partitions in one and to delete all data that they contain?\nI guess they have read-only properties... How can I force deleting them?\nI see this in GParted:\n\n\n\n\nA: How to erase / delete / blank or wipe a disk\nI’m sure there are other methods, but the one I prefer to use is the one that uses dd to copy zeros, or random data in the file system I want to wipe.\nSo, run this command if you want to erase your… let’s say microSD card.\nSuppose it is mounted on /dev/sdd1:\ndd if=/dev/urandom of=/dev/sdd1\n\nIf you do not want to wait too much, you can fill the partition with zeros instead of random data:\ndd if=/dev/zero of=/dev/sdd1\n\nBoth are secure, but IMHO the first one may be better, but of course I can be wrong.\nOnce again, be sure to double check, or better triple check on which partition you are going to apply this, you will not be warned by Linux, and the result can not be undone.\nA good practice could be to first make an image of the disk and then wipe it. If you want to proceed that way, do this.\ndd if=/dev/[partition-to-wipe] of=/tmp/backup.img\n\nThen wipe it\ndd if=/dev/urandom of=/dev/[partition-to-wipe]\n\nYou can then recover the data by doing\ndd if=/tmp/backup.img of=/dev/[partition-to-wipe]\n\nInfo taken from this site.\n\nA: Just use GParted.\n\nUnmount all the partitions on the USB stick, and then delete them. You can then create partitions as you like. The is some documentation here if you need any.\nThis should effectively wipe any partitions. - remember to click this green button, or it won't do anything:\n\n\nIf you just want to wipe it, you could also find the device name in sudo fdisk -l in terminal, and then run:\nsudo dd /dev/zero /dev/sdX1\n\nWhere sdX1 is the name and partition number of the device, which you can find in GParted or fdisk. This is not that necessary if you just use GParted, but you may need to use GParted afterwards to reformat it anyway... \n\nA: Simple! Start up gparted via the terminal (Ctrl+Alt+T) and entering sudo gparted\n.\nOnce you do that gparted will start.\n\nThe USB stick should show in the disks area (upper-right-hand corner) as something like /dev/usb or /dev/sdb. Make sure the disk selected is the USB stick, the following steps will wipe ALL data on the selected disk.\n\n\n*\n\n*Go to Device>Create Partition Table This window will come up: \n\n\n\nclick Apply .

I assume that's what you are looking for.\nThis file in turn includes other files in /usr/include/x86_64-linux-gnu/asm/, like unistd_32.h or unistd_64.h, where you will find the actual system call numbers. So to answer your second question - yes, these numbers may differ across 32-bit and 64-bit flavors of a particular Ubuntu version.\nEdit: Note that the above paths refer to 64-bit Ubuntu.

The maximum brightness in Ubuntu is much lower than it was with the preinstalled Windows 8. Brightness controls work, but they go from backlight being totally off to something like 50-60% of Windows brightness.\nI've tried changing grub settings to acpi_vendor=legacy as well as vendor. I've also tried various settings for the osi string.\nAny ideas how to diagnose and fix this? I think I'm the first person to ever install linux on this particular laptop.

I love this laptop and can't really consider switching back to windows, but the screen is really dim.\n\nA: Try this, just press Ctrl+Alt+T on your keyboard to open Terminal. When it opens, run the command(s) below:\nsudo apt-get install xbacklight\n\nThen you can set the backlights brightness percentage from terminal\nxbacklight -set 10\n\nAlso you may want to take a look at dconf-editor.

The problem is that resolv.conf is a symlink.  NetExtender backs up the file and restores it but changes it from a symlink to a real file.

Source\nFrom OpenSuse: \n\nThe kernel implementation of realtime trim in 11.2, 11.3, and 11.4 is not optimized. The spec. calls for trim supporting a vectorized list of trim ranges, but as of kernel 3.0 trim is only invoked by the kernel with a single discard / trim range and with current mid 2011 SSDs this has proven to cause a performance degradation instead of a performance increase. There are few reasons to use the kernels realtime discard support with pre-3.1 kernels. It is not known when the kernels discard functionality will be optimized to work beneficially with current generation SSDs.\n\nUbuntu is also looking at enabling TRIM automatically by having the system regularly run fstrim. This will hopefully be part of Ubuntu 14.04 so Ubuntu users won’t be forced to deal with SSD performance degradation or run fstrim on their own.

I tried booting into Ubuntu and got only a blank screen. I tried restarting and editing the boot options at grub replacing quiet splash with nomodeset again, but this didn't work.\nAt this point I used to Live CD to boot back into Ubuntu and installed and ran the boot-repair utility. During some of the commands it had me copy into the terminal I got some warnings back:\nsource_dir doesn't exist. Please specify --target or --directory.\n\ngrub-efi-amd64-signed depends on grub-efi-amd64; however, \nPackage grub-efi-amd64 is not configured yet.\n\nEven though I got these warnings it appeared the utility finished running successfully. It gave me the following URL: http://paste.ubuntu.com/6584972\nIt told me to make sure that it boots from sda2/EFI/ubuntu/shimx64.efi.\nAfter this I rebooted and switched back to UEFI. After rebooting normally I got grub again, this time with entries for Windows 8 and Windows recovery. I was able to boot into Windows 8 just fine. Ubuntu still hangs on a blank screen and doesn't load. If I hit the advanced options and try to select any of the ubuntu options it stops at Loading initial ramdisk.

This question is merely of general interest. I'm a newbie to Ubuntu and like it quite a lot. However, troubleshooting takes up quite a lot of my time, because I love software and install left right and center, and when I got a problem later on I cannot figure out which one of the newly installed software caused it, or where to look for the problem. I had a problem earlier today where specifically Downloads close right after I opened it with Files / File Manager, using Nautilus. Documents, Pictures and the rest works fine though. Installed two other file managers (PCmanFM and Thunar) and Downloads works fine with them.\nAs a Windows user I am using SlimCleaner there, which is pure gold for checking on the health of Windows, it's basically a all-in-one command centre to see what is installed from software to toolbars, and much more, and helps a lot to identify problems on a computer. Unfortunately SlimCleaner is not available for Linux.\nI am looking for a similar program for Ubuntu. At the moment I don't know where to look for 'dead files' that is just taking up space, I don't know what the health of my Ubuntu is, I don't know if a website hacked my browser and installed an add-on, I don't know if there are any corrupt files on it, etc. So the software I'm looking for must give me a nice overview of almost anything on Ubuntu, if you understand what I mean. A fix-it-all type of software, like those registry-cleaners and defragmenting software you get in Windows.\nI surfed askubuntu but could not find a similar thread or solution, and believe many new users would like to identify potential problems on their systems at one central place. For all that I know Ubuntu itself may already have something like that built-in?\nOh, and I do read every Ubuntu manual and book that I can get hold of. :) I'm just a bit disappointed after seeing how many hours I spent looking for a solution to a problem, while software would have shown it to me in seconds, and probably fix it in a few more.\n\nA: You just have to look in the /var/log/ directory and check the logs. That's the linux way. The most important log there is the /var/log/syslog. Please see the answers to this and this question, or this article for more info or each logfile. You can access some of these logs in the Log File Viewer (just search for it in the Dash), but most of the Linux users like to read directly the text files.\nAlso if one of your graphical application produces silent errors during it's runtime, those errors will be logged in ~/.xsession-errors . (If you see there DEBUG or WARNING messages, those are not ERRORS, and most likely can be ignored.)\n\nA: \nA fix-it-all type of software, like those registry-cleaners and defragmenting software you get in Windows.\n\nYou will not find that kind of software for Ubuntu, nor any Linux distribution. \"Why?\" you ask. This is because the nature itself of all Linux distribution which is a very modular operative system. Also, do-it-all tools has not been developed, and instead there has been small highly specialized tools instead.\nThat you have problems while installing a program would not affect other programs that has no relationship with the problematic piece of software. Linux doesn't have a registry-like structure that needs cleaning. There isn't almost any kind of malaware that could affect the stability of a patched and updated system.\nIf you find a problem somewhere is easily discoverable and most of the time fixable. There are logs that keep a watchful eye on the most important parts of the system. Programs normally doesn't get loaded at start which reduce the memory print. You can easily revert almost any change that you made to the system.\nSo, what you need:\n\n\n*\n\n*You may want to use a Virtual Machine to play and experiment before using it in your production system.\n\n*You may investigate before hand what are you going to install before messing with your system.\n\n*You may do periodic backups (if you are not already) to restore the system to a good state.\n\n", "Q: Postfix SMTP-AUTH On a VPS with Ubuntu 12.04 server, I have install and configure postfix.\nFor the SMTP-AUTH I used the mail-stack-delivery package (previously packaged as dovecot-postfix).\n\nsudo apt-get install mail-stack-delivery\n\nAfter that in /etc/postfix/main.cf I have these two lines:\nsmtpd_tls_cert_file = /etc/ssl/certs/server.crt\n\nsmtpd_tls_key_file = /etc/ssl/private/server.key\n\nMy question is these files server.crt and server.key are ok OR I have to create others with the openssl (a Self-Signed Certificate).\n\nA: Answer is dependent. In some cases can you do just fine with the generated ones.\nBut the best practice and my strongest advice is to generate new ones. That because some clients or servers might reject to deliver when the common name or domain tag on your server certificates doesn't match the destination they are trying to deliver to. Also if you have clients with the right version of outlook, will they be nagged with a warning they can't get rid off unless you create a correct certificate and install the public part or CA on the client.\n", "Q: Tried updating from 11.10 to 12.04, gets stuck at boot screen The update finished, upon restart I get stuck at this:  \n\n\n\n*\n\n*and nothing afterwards. Before I attempt a complete reinstall, are there any other steps I can take?\n\n\nIf I do end up reinstalling, what is the best way to back up my files from the Windows side? As of right now, I cannot view them because Windows sees the folder as a protected recovery partition.\n\nA: You cannot easily back up your files on Linux from Windows, as Windows can't read the ext4 filesystem.  You will need to boot into a LiveUSB / LiveCD environment and mount your Linux partition, and copy off data from your Linux partition to your Windows partition that you want to keep via the LiveUSB/LiveCD environment.\nFrom there, if your upgrade failed and gets you stuck in a boot screen, I suggest a clean install of 12.04, then restore your files which you backed up afterwards.\nThis is just my suggestion, though, there may be better suggestions from others if you wait a bit more.\n", "Q: Boot hangs in a live USB over a Toshiba Qosimo X75 I just purchased a Toshiba Qosimo X75-A7298 laptop and want to install Ubuntu on it (don't particularly care which version).

IMO 1080p isn't necessary, especially since the other vids from earlier are 720p and are just fine; I don't know and aren't sure but I think all these vids are HD, which explains their size. The rest of the info given by VLC during playback, for completeness:\nDecoded format: Planar 4:2:0 YUV\n\nI've found not just one answer and they all use ffmpeg but avconv is the successor; I know, they're same thing, for most part at least. I know from experience avconv doesn't accept some options designed for ffmpeg. Not to mention that both have options which sound similar within same program but have totally different results.\n\nA: 1. Get ffmpeg\nIt is always a good idea to use a recent build when encoding with ffmpeg. Development is very active and using a recent build will allow you to avoid fixed bugs while giving you access to the latest features.\nThere are two main methods to get ffmpeg and neither will interfere with packages from the repository including the so-called \"ffmpeg\" package:\nUsing a static build\nThis is simply a binary that someone else compiled. All you do is download, extract, and run it (note the ./ before ffmpeg):\nwget http://ffmpeg.gusari.org/static/32bit/ffmpeg.static.32bit.$(date +\"%F\").tar.gz\ntar xzvf ffmpeg.static.32bit.$(date +\"%F\").tar.gz\n./ffmpeg -i input.mp4 <your options> output.mkv\n\nCompiling ffmpeg\nWhen compiling you control exactly how ffmpeg is configured and also allows you to use certain encoders, such as libfdk_aac, that are not available in the static builds.\nJust follow a step-by-step guide: How to Compile FFmpeg on Ubuntu. If you can copy and paste you can compile ffmpeg.\n\n2. Encode\nffmpeg -i in.avi -vf scale=-1:720 -c:v libx264 -crf 18 -preset fast -c:a copy out.mkv\n\nIn this example:\n\n\n*\n\n*The scale filter to resize the video. With scale you can just declare one dimension, height in this case, and use -1 in the other. ffmpeg will then automatically calculate the correct value while maintaining the aspect ratio.\n\n*The encoder libx264 will produce H.264 video. Quality is controlled with -crf. The range is a log scale of 0 to 51. 0 is lossless (files will likely be huge), 18 is often considered to be \"visually lossless\", 23 is default, and 51 is worst quality. Generally you use the highest value that still gives you an acceptable quality.\n\n*Video encoding speed/compression efficiency for this encoder is controlled with the -preset. These are: ultrafast, superfast, veryfast, faster, fast, medium, slow, slower, veryslow. Default is \"medium\". Generally you use the slowest preset that you have patience for.\n\n*For a set of videos use the same -crf and -preset for all of them.\n\n*The audio will be stream copied from the input to the output. Think of it like a copy and paste.\n\n*The Matroska output container will be used. It supports more formats not it is not as widely supported by players and devices as MP4 for example.\nEncoding all videos\nYou can use a bash \"for loop\" to encode all videos in a directory:\nmkdir encoded\nfor f in *.avi; do ./ffmpeg -i \"$f\" -vf scale=-1:720 -c:v libx264 -crf 18 -preset fast -c:a copy encoded/\"${f%.avi}.mkv\"; done\n\n\nAlso see\n\n\n*\n\n*FFmpeg and x264 Encoding Guide\n\n*FFmpeg and AAC Encoding Guide\n", "Q: How to keep your terminal running when laptop lid is closed This my first time using Ask Ubuntu so something might go wrong\nI am running Ubuntu 13.10 on a laptop.

I got a video who needs some delicate tweaks. In that video I recite several poems. My voice sounds too low, while the background noise is too high. If someone turns its sound at maximum to be able to hear and understand me, his ears will be hurt by the final applauses. \nSo, I really need to edit this video before I can make it public, but, as you can see, this task is very delicate and complicated. I was not able to find a proper solution for it while i was using Windows. Now, that I am a new Linux user, the task gets even harder. But I hope that with your help and your vast experience, I can find the right app for this. \nI know that there is a list of video editing software on the wiki section of askubuntu site, but that list by itself, can't help me. I need an exact answer from someone who went trough the same problem and found the solution. \nPlease, take into consideration the fact that I am a newbie in Linux and I have a Gnome environment on my PC.\n\nA: To get a good noise reduction we cannot simply rely on basic denoise filters, as these may not be much more than low or high pass filters which then may lead to a rather muffled result.\nA better approach will be using a dedicated audio processor designed to have good noise reduction algorithms on the audio content of our video only.\nTo do so the following short tutorial uses Audacity for audio processing, and FFmpeg for audio extraction and rebuilding the video.\n\n*\n\n*Extract the audio from our video file\nTo keep the original's audio encoding we need to find out what codec the audio of our video file uses. This will e.g. be displayed on the right click file Properties > Video/Audio  tab. You e.g will find it is AAC or mp3 encoded. Then we can extract the audio of an mp4 file with the following command:\n ffmpeg -i infile.mp4 -acodec copy outfile.aac\n\nThe option -acodec copy says we do not resample audio\n\n\n*Use Audacity's noise reduction filters:\n\n\n*\n\n*How to improve the sound quality of an mp3 speech file?\n\n\n*Merge audio and video again.\nAgain, to avoid resampling we need the option copy to just use the data as they are. The source video's audio track will be remapped to the denoised sample with the following command:\n    ffmpeg -i infile.mp4 -i denoised-audio.m4a -vcodec copy -acodec copy -map 0:0 -map 1:0 denoised-video.mp4\n\n\nA: So the audio level needs to be 'compressed', that is, the loudest and the quietest volumes need to be brought closer together. That could be done manually by someone 'riding the gain' (manually adjusting the audio level, or Audacity does that automatically for audio).  \nHowever, you need to keep the audio synchronized with the video, and Audacity won't do video, so I suggest you register at the Avidemux forum and post your question there, for Avidemux is the most popular video-audio editor for Linux (based on frequency of http://SourceForge.net downloads).  \nThere's also a list of other video+audio editors here on Video editing software options? and from the screenshot, PITIVI will also do what you need.\n", "Q: Moved /home to a separate partition, now I can't log into it I looked at this and that then attempted to move /home to a (pre-existing) partition.

Also my other parts are a AMD A4 Llano APU, MSI a55m-p33 mobo, and the OS and games are on a Toshiba 500GB laptop HDD. Can anyone give any insight to this?\n\nA: Monitor your RAM usage with the System Monitor program. If you run out of RAM during gameplay, you should consider purchasing an upgrade to solve the issue. I wouldn't recommend increasing the swappiness level as a permanent solution because it affects the whole system, but it might help you.\n\nA: Probably is your RAM. You can try lowering the swappiness level to 10 with sudo sysctl vm.swappinnes=10. Maybe this will help you a little bit... But I have to say that this happens to me too, but my laptop is intel-only, but the point is that on Windows those problems don't occur, making me think that maybe it's a porting problem.\nBTW, swappiness is the process on which your system paginate or move program data to secondary memory (swap space on hard disk) to make space for other processes. The problem with this is that the procces causes a lot of overhead, mainly with heavy games.It did help me, so, maybe it will help you.\n\nA: \nI have a Mushkin 2GB DDR3 installed. When I look at the hardware, though, it shows it as 1.4GB.\n\nThe absent 0.6GB is typically used for graphics, hence the discrepancy.   \nSome PCs work better when memory is installed in matching pairs of DIMMs; heck, some servers want troikas of DDR3. Your motherboard has dual memory channels as per http://us.msi.com/product/mb/A55M-P33.html#/?div=Basic, so memory would run 10% faster if you instead had a pair of 1GB DDR3 DIMMs, and adding another 2GB DIMM from the same manufacturer with the same specs would speed things up more. \n", "Q: Ubuntu install (replacing Elementary OS) fails after BIOS I have an Acer Aspire M5-583P laptop which has ElementaryOS on it as its main OS. I was going to replace it with Ubuntu but while installing (from USB drive) an error occurred; it stopped installing and logged me off. So I had to shutdown by holding the power button. \nWhen I try to reboot from the USB drive, after it gives me a selection from where to reboot from, it doesn't do anything-- just stays at a black screen, instead of taking me to Yumi to choose which distro to launch.  \nSo I restarted the laptop again this time choosing to go into BIOS but after I enter my password it goes to a black screen as well. Can't do anything there..  \nSo I restarted again and I just let it boot on its own and it just gets stuck on the Acer logo menu where it says press f2 for bios or f12 for boot options.. I have no idea what to do, I am scared that my laptop has become corrupt and unusable. \n\nA: Suggest, on another machine, completely erase the USB flash drive before putting just Ubuntu back on to create an Ubuntu-onlu LiveUSB, then use that to reboot and do an {F12} reinstall. I've made that transition myself (although I used Xubuntu not Ubuntu) and it worked flawlessly on my Thinkpads, both models SL400 and R60.\n\nA: Yes Resetting the Bios would be your only option at this point. Cause as you stated that it just sits and hangs on the acer screen at boot. Sounds to me you have some kinda corrupt POST going on in the BIOS.

Somehow in the setup, I did not specify that /home be set to a separate (extended) partition (/dev/sda7). So the install set up /home on the /root partition, and I am now in a right serious muddle.\nI would like to \n1) tell it to set /home to sda7 (permanently so that it boots each time that  way), and\n2) move my existing /home from my old workhorse 10.04 to /home on this 12.04 computer.

No luck. \nI know I could change the background by using Edit-->Profile Preferences-->Colors but I want to understand Xresources \nEdit: I asked this quesion on Ubuntu Forums and received this response from Toz\n\nWhich terminal program are you using? The process you list works fine for xterm (and other Xt library-derived applications). If you're using gnome-terminal or xfce4-terminal, then you're out of luck - neither terminal doesn't use Xresources to set its properties. You have to use the configuration system that the program uses.\n\nAt the time I was not using xterm so it didn't make sense to use .Xresources. \n\nA: .Xresources doesn't work for me either anymore. My workaround is to use /etc/X11/app-defaults/XTerm-color and /etc/X11/app-defaults/XTerm.\n\nA: From what you're saying (specifically your reference to the menu entry Edit-->Profile Preferences-->Colors) I infer that you are using gnome-terminal.\nThat is the reason it doesn't work: gnome-terminal does not use the ~/.Xresources  or ~/.Xdefaults files. It has its own configuration, stored elsewhere (specifically, ~/.gconf/apps/gnome-terminal/).\nAlso see here: https://bbs.archlinux.org/viewtopic.php?pid=1003284\nBack in the old days, when everything was streamlined and standardized on GNU/Linux, basically any terminal program would use those files. But nowadays, every developer is doing their own thing, especially when you look to Gnome, KDE and consorts.\nIf you would like to understand and play around with the ~/.Xresources and ~/.Xdefaults files, use an old-school X terminal such as xterm, rxvt or urxvt.\n\nA: You can export your XENVIRONMENT as follow: \nexport XENVIRONMENT=\"${HOME}/.Xresources\"\n\n", "Q: Why did my server repeatedly request the packages.bz2 file from a mirror for 24 hours? One of our servers ended up using about 20 GB of data yesterday because it was repeatedly requesting the packages.bz2 file from a mirror.\nThe requests began about 22:00 on Sunday night, and stopped about 21:00 on the Monday.\nThere is nothing in the apt history, unattended-upgrades, or the system log to indicate why.\nAll I can see is a bunch of blocked traffic in the UFW log from the mirror IP address - there are no rules to block this IP in the UFW setup, communication to the mirror is successful outside this period of unusual activity, so it looks like flood protection (though I've gone through the UFW configuration and couldn't find this explicitly set).\n/var/log/apt/term.log and /var/log/apt/term.log have no entries after 6:45 last Friday (2 whole days before the event started).\n/var/log/aptitude is empty since its creation over a year ago.\nauth.log shows normal cron activity for an Ubuntu server - and not a lot else besides my logins and use of sudo when trying to diagnose the problems on there.\nThere is nothing in cron.d calling apt or aptitude - and cron.daily has the same collection of scripts as other servers that are not misbehaving.\nI've spoken with the sysadmin for the mirror - he was very helpful. This is how I found out that my server was requesting the packages.bz2 file repeatedly. He says that each request was fulfilled and closed correctly.\nSo - what could have happened to start this process? Why would it go on for so long, and why did it just stop?\n\nAnd one week later, it started again - still nothing in the logs to indicate why.\n\nA: apt-get update isn't logged in the APT logs.\nTo me, it appears that the server didn't get the file, or it was invalid. Another possibility is a strange cron script.\nNow the reason is a bit more interesting.\nEither\n\n\n*\n\n*There is maybe a cron to run apt-get update\n\n*Someone (another admin and/or hacker) was spamming apt-get update\nWhy it would run 23 hours... Maybe a bad cron entry?\nAlso, not really an expert on UFW/blocking. \nPersonally, I would check cron, and auth.log as @Braiam suggested.\n\nA: To me this sounds like a scripts loop. \nDoes the system happen to be set to update it's software at sundays at around 22.00?\nDo you have some sort of script running for updating it without attendance?\n", "Q: 12.04 LTS server - no wifi Someone installed Ubuntu 12.04 LTS for me on my Lenovo S210 IdeaPad but there's no WIFI access.\nand I can't ping anything other than the static IP.\nlspci -nnk |grep - e \":\" -e driver |grep ath\nKernel driver in use: ath9k\n\nnm-tool  shows wlan0 \"state\" is disconnected but I see valid entries in Wireless Access Points.

Does using a extended cache (readyboost-like) improves the overall performance? I read a lot about it and some says that it's just for old machines with low RAM and also the 480mbit/s of usb2.0 was just too slow for cache, and others says that it improves no matter if you got high amounts of ram.\nI ask this, because the answers that I found were from a time where usb3.0 was not a standart thing like it's now.\n\nA: Nowadays, extended cache is popular for folks with large databases, and research by Kang, Lee and Moon describes how custom coding to take advantage of flash memory can speed up PostgreSQL.\nBcache's author says it's dandy for RAID6 users, but his raw data also shows inconsistant performance as block sizes decrease, and he did not use USB3, he used an SSD on a SATA cable.\nTherefore, I would say yes if you were running with RAID6 or PostgreSQL with the Kang, Lee and Moon code, but questionable otherwise.\n", "Q: 12.04 - cannot access wireless at work but can access it at home I'm new to ubuntu, and haven't used UNIX since my college days in the 90s.

I'm not sure if this is a long-term solution, but in any case shows that this is network issue and not something related to transmission.\nThanks everyone for their help.\n\nA: In my case, it was also helpful to change the setting of the random port picking option to true. In transmission, you do it by following these instructions: \nEdit → Preferences → Network Tab → Tick the first box\n\nA: I was facing the same issue. Changed the peer-port-random-on-start to true as suggested. Still was unable to download. Checked on some of the other forums & found a tool called \"deluge\". Installed it on my Ubuntu 16.10 machine & the downloads are working fine now. Wonder what was the issue with transmission.\nBelow is the link to install deluge on Ubuntu 16.10 :\nhttps://www.linuxbabe.com/bittorrent/deluge-bittorrent-client-ubuntu-16-04\n\nA: I've changed the setting peer-port-random-on-start from false to true. That did the trick for me(transmission-daemon).\n\nA: I have AT&T at home and I was messing around with my router. I have always had the NetBIOS protocol turn off, but I had disabled the All Other Protocols option on my system.  It appears that Transmission used one of the vague protocols with my router. As soon as I re-enabled it, I was able to get Transmission to work for me. \nHTTP\nHTTPS\nFTP \nTelnet\nSMTP\nDNS\nNetBIOS\nPOP3\nIMAP\nNNTP\nIRC \nH323\nAll Other Protocols \n\nA: Adding port forwarding rules for the values in /etc/transmission-daemon/settings.json called peer-port-random-high and peer-port-random-low on your router (for me it was 65535 and 49152) and then again on your device with ufw allow low:high/tcp worked for me.\n", "Q: Can't create Windows 7 install bootable USB I'm trying to create a bootable windows 7 installation USB drive through Ubuntu.

The log said:\nDec 17 10:24:26 phz225 cron[1078]: (CRON) INFO (Running @reboot jobs)\n\nSo, it should have nothing to do with the hardware.\nMy question is: How to turn off this automatic rebooting? I routinely submit jobs that can last for days or weeks and I don't want to lose the results. \nFor you information, this is the complete syslog.1.\n\nA: The line about @reboot jobs is printed after the system boots. A @reboot job is one that is set to automatically run on every boot.

When I use bumblebee optirun command to start a program , Google Chrome for example, my laptop indicates that it switched to nvidia GPU. My question is: Is then whole desktop rendered by nvidia or just the program I started with optirun ?\nI can't imagine that some parts of screen are rendered by one graphic card and other parts by another, but the way optirun command is used (in combination with specific program)makes me wonder.\n\nA: optirun is an abstraction for VirtualGL. This runs a headless X screen with your Nvidia card and renders the application on that screen. The result is copied over to your visible screen. VGL also allows you to send the result over a network which is pretty cool.\nEverything that isn't being optirun'd is directly rendered through your Intel device. That includes the desktop (by default - I'm certain you could hack everything to be optirun if you really wanted - but I wouldn't recommend it).\n\nA: \nI can't imagine that some parts of screen are rendered by one graphic\n  card and other parts by another […]\n\nThat's exactly what happens, though. Bumblebee uses a second \"display\" (technically, it's an X server) to render programs started with optirun, then displays the windows of that program on your primary (that is, the one you see) display.\nThe official Bumblebee FAQ provides a more technical explanation.\n", "Q: Open source ATi driver froze after installation and fail to boot I installed today a HD5500 Radeon card in my system today, and installed the open source driver.

As you can see, you don't have write permissions in /media/username. That means that GEncfsM can't create the mount-points. To fix this use:\nsudo chown username /media/username\n\nIt will then read:\ndrwxr-x---+ 5 username root 4096 Dec 17 10:29 username\n\n...\nIf you want to put all mount-points per default there, you can then adjust the variable mount_dir_base in the advanced preferences to /media/$USER.

My issues with unity-gtk-module are pretty much identical but with different package names.\nI have a couple of very related questions regarding this:\n\n\n*\n\n*Why are some very important 32-bit packages not installable using apt? Am I missing a source?\n\n*Why didn't the i386 version of overlay-scrollbar get installed above? Is it because the installer contains both 32-bit and 64-bit versions of the library and automatically decided to install just the 64-bit one on my system? Can I force it to install both?\n\n\nA: apt-get download overlay-scrollbar-gtk2\nsudo dpkg --ignore-depends overlay-scrollbar -i overlay-scrollbar-gtk2*.deb\n\nSimple.\nThis will work, if you've already installed package for your architecture. If not, you will get errors, while trying to use dpkg/apt-get next time. To fix them, run:\nsudo gedit /var/lib/dpkg/status\n\nFind Package: [package name, overlay-scrollbar-gtk2 in this case], and remove ignored dependencies from Depends: (overlay-scrollbar in this case).\nIf you use gedit, make sure you've disabled automatic backups in Edit > Preferences > Editor before saving. Notice that gedit has seperate preferences for each user, and you're running it as root.\n\nA: The overlay-scrollbar package does not come in i386 or amd64 flavors; it comes as an \"all\" flavor, which installs on all archs.\nIt appears to be missing the Multi-Arch: allowed header so it won't satisfy an i386 package depending on it.  You should file a bug report asking that the missing header be added.\n", "Q: php excel installation gives error I need to install php excel writer (PHPExcel) in my machine running Ubuntu 12.04.

After the upgrade of ubuntu to 13.10 the performance of my VM has degreased extremely and I think it is because no proprietary drivers seem to be available. The VM runs on decent system (SSD, 4GB ram for the VM, I5 3570) and has worked fine before the update. No third party drivers are beeing offered through the update system (hui). \nI have tried several tutorials to install the drivers manually but without success. The 7900 is listed as a supported card at the AMD drivers page and I have tried both the stable and the beta release however without much success. After the last listed tutorial the system boots to the login screen where it returns after entering the password (with a short black screen inbetween).

Should the performance be fine with the open source drivers?\n\nA: VMware based virtual machine products emulate a graphics controller, you cannot use HD7900 graphics driver within the vm because the vm has a different graphics controller, you must install drivers for your card on the host os, and install vmware tools in the guest os. If you would like to attach a real graphics controller to a virtual machine you will need to use an alternative software that supports pci-e vm inputs such as Parrallels Workstation Extreme, in which case you need two graphics cards (1 for the host, 1 for the guest).\nFor more information about connecting pci-e devices to a vm directly read this:\nhttp://kb.parallels.com/en/9427\n", "Q: Can't bootUbuntu 64-bit using Virtual Box on host Windows 7 64-bit The error I get says,\n\nThis kernel requires and x86-64 CPU, but only detected an i686 CPU.\n  Unable to boot - please us a kernel appropriate for your CPU.\n\nI have Enabled I/O APIC.  \n\nA: You must also enable 64 bit support for that particular VM -- to save you overhead, Virtual Box defaults to 32-bit VMs.\nThis is per Virtualbox's Manual -- The other thing you may want to check is that you have hardware virtualization extensions enabled in your system's own bios, as the manual points out 64 bit virtualization is not delivered by the software virtualization engine.\n", "Q: slime-lookup-definition not working with sbcl One of the nicer things of programming with Common Lisp and the combination of Emacs / Slime is, that you can jump quickly to the source of builtin or your own functions with \nM+..\nI can't get this to work however, for sbcl's builtin functions.

I have tweaked the permissions on /media/username from root:root to username:root [1]. I understand that a user-centric location allows user-centric permissions [2].\nBut why were the permissions for this folder root:root in the first place?\n\n[1] So that I can mount encrypted folders there with Gnome EncFS Manager. For example, I can now mount an encrypted folder as /media/username/personal-documents.\n[2] From Why has Ubuntu moved the default mount points? :\n\nThe root cause for this change of default behaviour in udisks2 seems clear : the security. It is safer to restrict access to a file system to one particular user instead of giving access to it to all the users of the system.\n\n\nA: In my case this is how things look in /media:\n$ ls -l /media | grep $USER\ndrwxr-x---+  3 root root 4096 Jan 22 15:59 oli\n\nBasically this means that only a root user can interact with the directory. This is great for security (certainly stops other users seeing, let alone stealing/deleting/changing data) but that's not where the story ends.\nYou might notice the plus sign at the end of the permission mask. This means an ACL (Access Control List) is in use. This allows for far more granular permissions.\n$ getfacl /media/$USER\ngetfacl: Removing leading '/' from absolute path names\n# file: media/oli\n# owner: root\n# group: root\nuser::rwx\nuser:oli:r-x\ngroup::---\nmask::r-x\nother::---\n\nIt's through ACL where my user is allowed to view the contents of /media/oli. I'm still not allowed to edit the contents.\nThe thing doing the mounting in modern desktops (both Gnome and KDE) is udisks2:\nroot      2882  0.3  0.0 195956  4048 ?        Sl   Jan16  30:35 /usr/lib/udisks/udisks-daemon\nroot      2887  0.0  0.0  47844   784 ?        S    Jan16   0:00 udisks-daemon: not polling any devices\nroot      3386  0.0  0.0 429148  6980 ?        Sl   Jan16   7:35 /usr/lib/udisks2/udisksd --no-debug\n\nAs you can see, it's running there as root, so when something accesses it over DBUS, it's able to create the mount-points within /home/$USER and chown them down to your user so they can edit the contents.\nNone of that changes what I said originally. I'm just explaining how it works in practice. This is how something on your desktop is in-effect allowed to write somewhere that is only allowed by root, and how your user is allowed to read it despite an otherwise restrictive ownership.\nAll that turns it into an environment that is secure for the user's data but one that also makes it hard for the user to meddle with the fabric of the mount. They can't, for example, delete the mount-point or rename it which could cause issues unless they have root access.\nEdit: Something that just occurred to me is that it also gives an administrator a good place to mount things for a single user. The permissions by default help keep this mount private and protect this mount against the user's meddling. It seems like a fairly sane default for something that done without the /media/$user/ directory, would need root permissions.\n\nA: The Linux (and *nix) mentality in general is based on the principle of Least amount of necessary privileges.\nUsually modern Desktop Environments will mount your devices under /media/username/devicepartitionname. This means that for the device to be usable you only need to own the devicepartitionname folder and anything below it. This means that your folder of /media/username could still be owned by root, and that would make it more secure.\nAlso mounting anything on /media/username is a bad idea, as that will make your DE try to  mount a partition into a folder on another mounted partition which can lead to a lot of !!FUN!! (also probable data loss).\n\nA: I agree to the other answer and comments in addition to that  \nroot:root to avoid mainly two situations.\n1. Security risk : A hacker script which dump /dev/zero to /media/user/ which fill the root partition and hence unable to login or bad performance.\n2. Conflict with udisk2 : Assume a partition with label backup. Udisks mount it @ /media/user/backup . user manually created the above directory which will force the udisk to change mount point to something like /media/user/backup1 and thus misleaded by backup scripts etc. \n", "Q: Is possible to boot Ubuntu with less than 128MB of RAM? The machine I would like to install a working OS to is an old Toshiba Portege 3010ct notebook (Pentium 266 with 32MB EDO RAM and 4GB IDE hard drive). It's a quite slow and weak machine, but it's only needed for basic text editing, USB support (as it has 1x USB connector), and MP3 playing if it can handle that. The machine is flawless and is in working condition.\nThe BIOS it has is very basic and limited, and it can be only booted from either the hard drive or the floppy drive.. But here comes the twist : It does not have a floppy drive. It also lacks a CD-Rom, and it cannot boot from USB (no BIOS support). The only option is to boot from the hard drive. My only option to write to the hard drive is by removing it from the notebook, and plug it into my laptop via IDE to USB cable. I don't have a desktop machine to mount into as an internal hard drive. \nI am really hoping that someone knows how to make a bootable os under these circumstances, as it can be very tricky to set up a hard drive on USB to work later on in IDE mode. I experimented with a lot of operating systems in the past few weeks (dos, win98, winxp, wary puppy (linux)), repartitioned and reformatted the hard drives many times for the specific needs of the different operating systems, rewrote the MBR if it was needed, but i done it all the time via USB, and i think that is the main problem. Because when i try to boot from the hard drive it is running as an internal IDE drive. I dont know what/how to edit manually so that an actual operating system would install from the hard drive to the hard drive, or better, if it can be installed manually (by copying the needed files, and it would simpy boot).\nAny idea or solution is welcome!! :)\n\nA: With those specifications not even the lightest of the Ubuntu GUI-less distributions would work. Ubuntu needs at least 128MB of RAM and 3.5 GB of Hard Disk. You might try use PuppyLinux or DammSmallLinux and see if you have luck. I don't make promises.\n", "Q: How to identify Ubuntu's Release version via the GUI? I can identify Windows' Releases very easily even after the login process is over.  \nUbuntu's Desktops are similar between releases.  \nIs it possible to identify the release by looking at Ubuntu's Default wallpaper / Desktop?  \n\nA: Gui : Go to system settings --> about system.\nWith commandline : lsb_release -d\n\nA: If you want a GUI mode to check the release version, just launch the System Monitor, the answer is on the system tab.\nAn alternate way is to guess by the default wallpaper, every version has a different, although similar looking wallpaper. Look here\nReflecting the comment What if they don't use the default wallpapers?: Because Linux/Ubuntu is very, customizable the users can easily change their whole Desktop Environment, so in that case it is impossible to tell by appearance. (Note: This is same with windows, the whole shell can be changed there also, and after that you won't be able to tell the difference. The difference is that on windows this is hard to do, and only the powerusers/customziers do this. So it is unusal to see a win computer with a non-default shell, on linux it is usual.)\n\nA: This might be impossible in the case of most previous Versions, especially from a customized desktop.  It can be made possible in next versions by making slight changes in the bar on the desktop.  So, an expecting solution is:\nAdd the Version to the name -- 'Ubuntu Desktop', that we see on the left top corner. Add one star for a version released just after an LTS version...two stars for the next......four stars for the LTS.  \nKeep a minimum space to show at least Ubuntu's logo and the Version to give freedom (to the user) to add more icons on this bar upto a certain limit without losing the identity.\nUse an entirely different Default wallpaper for each LTS version.\nIt will be useful if the Code name of LTS version is also added in the Log-in screen (not on the bar).  No need of Code name in Non-LTS\n", "Q: Connect Android device I've a phone with Android and I use Ubuntu in my PC.

Is there an example completion.sh I can use or something?\n\nA: I found a solution by using: http://manpages.ubuntu.com/manpages/oneiric/man1/npm-completion.1.html\nSpecifically I took the following file: http://manpages.ubuntu.com/manpages.gz/oneiric/man1/npm-completion.1.gz\nAnd extracted it to:\n/usr/share/npm/lib/utils/completion.sh\n\nAfter restarting the console, npm in would complete to npm install!\n", "Q: Juju \"RegionOne\" does not allow access to all required services Hi i am trying to configure juju over openstack under Ubuntu.

Thanks.\n\nA: The agent-state-info line describes the error that MAAS returned when trying to provision machine 1, and probably indicates that there aren't any \"ready\" nodes that can be allocated to the environment.\n\n\n*\n\n*To get a GUI running, you can deploy straight to the bootstrap node, and not require any additional hardware:\n$ juju add-unit juju-gui --to 0\n\n\n*To clear up the useless machine that failed provisioning:\n$ juju destroy-unit juju-gui/0\n$ juju destroy-machine 1\n\n...or, if you're running the latest version, you can just do:\n$ juju destroy-machine 1 --force\n\n...which will clean up all its units automatically for you.\n\n*To make your next deploy work well, check your MAAS GUI; it sounds as though you might not have any \"ready\" nodes for juju to allocate. The only node allocated should be the one that you bootstrapped onto -- if you allocated the other one manually, and now have none marked \"ready\", you need to either release that node or add new ones to the cluster, so that juju has at least one \"ready\" node to deploy onto.\n", "Q: Postgresql installation on Ubuntu 12.04 I have trouble installing postgresql with apt.\npostgresql-9.1 (or postgresql-9.3) installation fails with:\n* Starting PostgreSQL 9.1 database server\n* Error: could not exec /usr/lib/postgresql/9.1/bin/pg_ctl /usr/lib/postgresql/9.1/bin/pg_ctl start -D /var/lib/postgresql/9.1/main -l  /var/log/postgresql/postgresql-9.1-main.log -s -o  -c  config_file=\"/etc/postgresql/9.1/main/postgresql.conf\" :\n                                                                                                                                                                                                                               [fail]\ninvoke-rc.d: initscript postgresql, action \"start\" failed.\n\nWhen I try executing /usr/lib/postgresql/9.1/bin/pg_ctl /usr/lib/postgresql/9.1/bin/pg_ctl start -D /var/lib/postgresql/9.1/main -l  /var/log/postgresql/postgresql-9.1-main.log -s -o  -c  config_file=\"/etc/postgresql/9.1/main/postgresql.conf\"directly, it fails with:\n/usr/lib/postgresql/9.1/bin/pg_ctl: symbol lookup error: /usr/lib/postgresql/9.1/bin/pg_ctl: undefined symbol: PQping\n\nHere is my system information:\n$ uname -a\nLinux daclin 3.2.0-23-generic #36-Ubuntu SMP Tue Apr 10 20:39:51 UTC 2012 x86_64 x86_64 x86_64 GNU/Linux\n\nWould you have any idea on what is going on?\n\nA: I had that same setback myself too.

I haven't seen progress the past hour and this is the second attempt.\nI'm trying to install 13.10, using a Linux Live USB. I don't care about the contents of the laptop. \nI've been trying to find instructions about installing grub before starting the installation, hoping that would solve my issues, but I came up empty.\nLaptop is 2 years old, it used to run dual-boot windows 7 and Ubuntu. I'm now doing a fresh install of just Ubuntu.\nI hope anyone knows how I can find out why it is happening.\n\nA: During the installation, there's a way to skip installing grub. Look at the \"Device for boot loader installation\" dropdown.\nInstead of choosing the entire device \"/dev/sda\", choose the partition you'll install Ubuntu, such as: \"/dev/sda1\"\n\nIf you choose \"dev/sda\", you're supposed to rewrite the boot record for the entire drive, which I believe is what's your issue is all about.\nBut when you choose \"dev/sda1\" (or sda2,sda3...) you get to place the boot flag at the beginning of the partition, not the entire drive. That does not make you go for a change in your bootloader. In other words, you place a boot flag as a \"subtitle\" to your pre-existing bootloader.\nAfter you apply the fix, if you ever want to switch to Grub2 for any reason, use the Ubuntu Boot Repair disk: Ubuntu Boot Repair\nIf all else fails, try to \"rewrite your MBR\" because during your uninstallation of Windows, its boot sector may have accidentally remained there. Since you are doing a fresh install of Ubuntu, this may stand as the final option since there's a small chance that Ubuntu failed to handle your Windows partition's boot flags correctly.\n\nA: In case you have issue when installing on UEFI BIOS (not sure if this issue is adressed only to Acer Laptops) there is a topic here that helped me solve this issue. \nI will copy the commands in case it disappears, but all credit goes to Pueseso from Acer Community forum.\n-- Boot Ubuntu Live USB\n-- open terminal\nsudo -s\nubiquity -b\n-- Press Continue testing after installation is over.\n\n--Now we will return to the CLI (  https://wiki.debian.org/GrubEFIReinstall  )\n\nsudo mount /dev/sda2 /mnt #sda2 is the root partition\nsudo mkdir /mnt/boot/efi\nsudo mount /dev/sda1 /mnt/boot/efi #sda1 is the efi partition\nfor i in /dev /dev/pts /proc /sys; do sudo mount -B $i /mnt$i; done\n\nmodprobe efivars # make sure this is loaded\n\n-- notice the bootx64 file\nefibootmgr --verbose\n\n-- We will reinstall grub-install for a 64bit version\napt-get install --reinstall grub-efi-amd64\n\ngrub-install —no-nvram —root-directory=/mnt\nchroot /mnt\nupdate-grub\ncd /boot/efi/EFI\ncp -R ubuntu BOOT\ncd BOOT\ncp grubx64.efi bootx64.efi\n\n-- You are finished, reboot the system.\n\n", "Q: How do I change the 0[ins] key to an actual 0?

I have a process that I would like to see how much memory it consumes while it is running.\nRight now I do this:\nps faux | grep casper\n\nBut that just gives me the information of that moment.

You'll come back up without the /dev/sda3 home.  Mount /dev/sda3 on /mnt or somewhere, copy 'reg' over, uncomment the line in fstab, and\nmount -a\n\nAt this point it's probably best to just reboot again, as you'll likely be logged in as 'reg' and so therefore mounting /home over your current $HOME would not be doable.\nOf course, if you didn't have reg in /home beforehand, feel free to ignore all of the above.\n", "Q: Install Method \"Something Else\" unsable device So I am trying to install Ubuntu via the \"Something Else\" method.\nI have a 750gb HDD with 286gb used for window 7 the other part of the HDD is broken up into separate drives but is grouped together and is listed as unusable\nThe 453gb is divided into three drives in windows\n20gb ntfs\n20gb raw\n410gb ntfs with data on it\nwhy does is it not detecting the spare disk space as usable?\nwill I be able to install Ubuntu along side my windows 7 using this method?\nI want to install Ubuntu on one of the 20gb drives I created.\n\nA: In the short answer yes. You need to make sure the raw free space is not overlapping the other drives. That is why it says up usable. I would go into that pick one of the 20 go sets delete that partition the rest set it in the something else disk menu  just use the plus and minus to do it but be extremely careful only only do it to the free space you intend to install Ubuntu Linux on. Hope this helps. \n", "Q: how to use ffmepg codecs on ubuntu I want to play .wmv files on Ubuntu, but it seems these files are proprietary and are not playable under Windows. So downloaded the ffmpeg source code and compiled it. Now, ffmplay is able to play .wmv files. I want to know how I can use ffmpeg codecs with VLC player, or with Ubuntu's default video player. \n\nA: Unless we need a new or special version we do not have to compile the video tool FFmpeg . \nIt is available for installation from the repositories. When installed from there it will also install the codecs needed to play most formats. \nAt present this will be the package libavcodec-extra-53  which can also be installed without ffmpeg if we only needed the codecs for other applications.\nAfter installation ffmpeg will list all supported codecs including WMV versions with:\nffmpeg -codecs\n\nDue to a bug we will get this misleading message:\n*** THIS PROGRAM IS DEPRECATED ***\nThis program is only provided for compatibility and will be removed in a future release. Please use avconv instead.\n\nWe can ignore this as ffmpeg is still being supported and will be further developed too. But we can of course also install and run avconv  which has almost the same functionality and command syntax.\n\n\nA: You will want to get h264 since that's what VLC uses.  To get the codec for ffmpeg, you will need to recompile with the lib.  I wrote bash script for that to download and do all of compiling of multi-libs.\nhttps://gist.github.com/faroncoder/7935868\nYou will need to \n    chmod +x the file before firing off the script.\n", "Q: How can I make TVTime find my mixer? I am using a Winfast Leadtek TV 2000 XP card and TVTime 1.0.2 to watch analog TV. The TV card's sound output is hooked up to the CD-in of my mainboard (MSI Intel X58 Platinum).\nJust recently I managed to get ALSA to correctly recognize the CD-in (see How do I enable CD-in?).\nNow I would like TVTime to adjust the ALSA CD slider when turning the volume up and down in TVTime. However, TVTime refuses to do this and I always have to use alsamixer to control the volume.\nI have tried different settings for the MixerDevice setting in the tvtime.xml configuration file as suggested e.g. in https://askubuntu.com/a/217462/9598. When using this value, this is the output when running TVTime:\nRunning tvtime 1.0.2.\nReading configuration from /etc/tvtime/tvtime.xml\nReading configuration from /home/chrisipk/.tvtime/tvtime.xml\nALSA lib control.c:953:(snd_ctl_open_noupdate) Invalid CTL \nmixer: attach error: No such file or directory\nmixer: Can't open mixer , mixer volume and mute unavailable.\nThis is what I currently have:\n<option name=\"MixerDevice\" value=\"default/cd\"/>\nThis is the output when running TVTime:\nRunning tvtime 1.0.2.\nReading configuration from /etc/tvtime/tvtime.xml\nReading configuration from /home/chris/.tvtime/tvtime.xml\nmixer: find error: Success\nmixer: Can't open mixer default, mixer volume and mute unavailable.\nmixer: Can't open device default/cd, mixer volume and mute unavailable.\nThe current setting seems to be somewhat right as the output no longer complains about missing a file or directory and contains \"find error: Success\".\nWhat do I need to do so that TVTime can adjust my CD-in volume?\n\nA: I found the answer to a very similar question: https://askubuntu.com/a/51574/14220\nThis worked for me. Here is what the relevant line in my tvtime.xml now looks like:\n<option name=\"MixerDevice\" value=\"hw:0/CD\"/>\nNote that this is case sensitive, using a lowercase \"cd\" as suggested by the tvtime.xml man page did not work!\n", "Q: HOME variable is not set I have two servers, they're identical (I believe), production and staging servers.\nAnd I have upstart script in /etc/init/ folder.\ndescription \"Discoure process\"\n\nsetuid deploy\nsetgid deploy\n\nrespawn\nrespawn limit 3 30\n\nstart on runlevel [2345]\nstop on runlevel [06]\n\nscript\nexec /bin/bash <<'EOT'\n  echo \\\"$HOME/.rbenv\\\"\n\n  cd /home/deploy/discourse/current\n\n  bundle exec bluepill load config/discourse.pill --no-privileged --base-dir tmp/bluepill --logfile log/bluepill.log\nEOT\nend script\n\nOn the staging server it works well, but when I'm running that script on production server then the HOME variable is empty, the code echo \"$HOME/.rbenv\" is evaluating to \"/.rbenv\"\nWhat might be a problem here? Thanks\n\nA: Seems like the $HOME is being interpreted before it goes to bash? I would try one of the following. Either add:\nenv HOME=/home/MyName\n\nto the code just after the description.\nOr move the code from inside the script block to another script file with:\n#! /bin/bash\n\nas line 1. Then have\nexec /path/to/my/script.sh\n\n\nA: Read this question on stackoverflow.com and this answer by user grawity on superuser.com\nYou should not use $HOME in init.d, because it is not clear which users home to use, until this user logs in.\nQuote from POSIX specification:\nHOME\nThe system shall initialize this variable at the time of login to be a pathname\nof the user's home directory. See <pwd.h>.\n\nYou can use little hack, to get home folder of user myuser in your script\nsu - myuser -c /usr/bin/env | grep HOME\n\nIt is better  to use script below, because usually there can be other HOME_* folders. Such as JAVA_HOME etc.\nsu - myuser -c /usr/bin/env | grep \"^HOME=\"\n\n\nA: If all you need is the HOME variable to be set (which solved my problem), you can explicitly set it with the env directive:\nenv HOME=/home/user\n\nvia https://askubuntu.com/a/1125244/160358\n", "Q: Fresh installation running rather sluggish Good day! Today I installed ubuntu on my home desktop (win 7 is the main OS). To this day I was running it in a virtual machine, but since I will do some of my work from home I decided to install it as a second OS.\nThe problem is that the installation runs rather slow. Nothing huge, however, on my work PC which is weaker some simple commands like apt-cache search or the creation of a database are made instantly. Same goes for the virtual machine. On this installation though, it takes a second or so for the basic command (like the apt-cache) and a couple of seconds for the creation of a database.\nIt is nothing fatal, however it is annoying to some extent and I am wondering what can be causing this. I do not recall seeing any option for limiting the processing power which the PC should be able to use(in the installation).\nAny ideas on what may be causing this?\nEDIT: Earlier today I updated everything via the package manager (sudo apt-get update ) I am not sure if this covers the drivers or not.\n\nA: sudo apt-get update doesn't actually install any updates. Although I do understand the confusion. What sudo apt-get update actually does is explained here, in a question also asked on AskUbuntu. After apt-get update you will probably want to run sudo apt-get dist-upgrade. Even easier would be using the software & updates tool available in recent Ubuntu versions.\nTry installing the latest updates and see if it really makes a difference. Since I don't really know about any of the hardware you are using I can't really help you with driver issues. From the software & updates application you can find proprietary drivers, which might boost your performance. Be cautious though, try using tested versions. Considering your experience with Ubuntu you might be in for even more issues if you use untested versions that might be unstable. \n", "Q: Need help installing Brother HL 2270dw printer Greetings. I am new to Linux and Ubuntu.\nI have really tried to install our new printer.

If I type: sudo /etc/printcap then the response is command not found.\nI would be very grateful if someone could help me get this printer installed and working wirelessly.\n\nA: You have to edit the file /etc/printcap, as described in step 5-2 of your link.\nYou can type:\nsudo gedit /etc/printcap\n\nIf that command does not work, you can edit the file with the terminal editor nano (the easiest for beginners):\nsudo nano /etc/printcap\n\nAnd then edit the file as described in the manual.\n", "Q: Reinstall ubuntu keeping data I have done 2 distribution upgrades in the past and each time I ended up with grave problems after that, so I decided not to do any automatic upgrades.\nHowever, I do want the newest distribution, since I start to notice my packages being outdated. (Most notably wine)\nMy plan is to reinstall (X)Ubuntu on the newest version and I've gathered some information on how to that. Since doing this is critical and anything going wrong could end up in a lot of time spent fixing it (and potential loss of data), I want to make sure I didn't miss anything.\nHere are my assumptions:\n\n\n*\n\n*I have /home on a separate partition. Anything on there is safe and reinstalling Ubuntu should not affect anything on there. (Except for some dependencies maybe, they should be easy to reinstall if need be)\n\n*I have a separate /boot partition. My boot loader can stay the way it is and does not need to be reinstalled. However, I might need to update the configs of GRUB.\n\n*I can save and restore all installed packages with these scripts: https://askubuntu.com/a/99151 (I am only talking about the first two presented there)\n\n*After reinstalling and restoring my package list, the package manager will still know which packages were installed by hand and which were installed as dependency. (I think I am wrong here)\n\n*After reinstalling and restoring my package list, my system will be almost the same as before. What I am losing is any configuration in /etc (Restoring that from a backup of an old version doesn't sound like fun, I can do with reconfiguring anything I changed) and any programs I installed that didn't register themselves with dpkg. (I actually want that)\nWhat I want to know now, is whether any of my assumptions are wrong or if I missed anything. Also, what happens if some of the packages I have installed are not available in the newer distribution?\nAnother thing: Which kind of Ubuntu should I install for this? (I'm thinking about the server version, since that seems to be the most light-weight kind)\nI hope you can help me with this problem.\n\nA: Don't assume your data is safe.  An error in installation can remove all data from your drive.  Back up everything you might want before starting.  My own technique is to use two or three hard drives.  I do the default install of the stable version of Ubuntu onto one drive and the testing version onto another.  The third drive is a backup of my home directory.  I always use the default on the installer to make a clean install to an entire drive.  I do this as soon as the first testing version is available and overwrite the previous stable version.  So far, I've never lost any data.\n\nA: You just need to do it (TM). Only some observations:\n\n\n*\n\n*ALWAYS BACKUP YOUR STUFF. Nothing, will keep you safe from a mistake, if you commit any, as a backup will do.\n\n*Double and triple check the partitioning, so you don't format partitions you shouldn't (like /home). Verify that the mounts points are correct the old / will be the new /, the old /boot will be the new /boot etc.\n\n*I wouldn't recommend importing the package list as is, but check out what is being removed installed before hand and if a package is not included. This requires manual check but you can prevent a bunch of them using:\ndpkg --get-selections | grep -E 'hold|deinstall' > packagelist.old\n\nThis will generate a sanitized list. In the new system do:\ndpkg --get-selections | grep -E 'hold|deinstall' > packagelist.new\n\nThen compare both lists. Some packages change names with the upgrade, so it's better that you check that.\n\nWhich kind of Ubuntu should I install for this?\n\nWhatever you like, but remember that Ubuntu server doesn't have a Graphical User Interface (GUI). Is pure text.\n", "Q: How to get Rhythmbox stations back! I accidentally removed the internet radio station HBR1 Tronic Lounge in the category House from Rhythmbox.

I am a linux newbie and I have a very basic question. I have three machines - \nmachineA\nmachineB\nmachineC\n\nand all those machines have Ubuntu 12.04 installed in it and I have root access to all those three machines.\nNow I am supposed to do below things - \nCreate mount point /opt/exhibitor/conf\nMount the directory in all servers.\n sudo mount <NFS-SERVER>:/opt/exhibitor/conf /opt/exhibitor/conf/\n\nI have already created /opt/exhibitor/conf directory in all those three machines as mentioned above. Now I am not sure how to create Mount Point /opt/exhibitor/conf and then Mount the directory in all three servers?\nAny thoughts?\n\nA: I'm using Samba on my servers, since staff uses Windows on their machines.\nSample entry in /etc/smb.conf:\n[Projects]\n    comment = Projects share\n    read only = true\n    path = /home/kovica/Projects\n    browsable = yes\n    writable = no\n    valid users = kovica\n    create mask = 0644\n\nThis entry shares directory /home/kovica/Projects. No one can write/delete/change files in it. The client has to authenticate and the only valid user is kovica. You add users to samba using \nsmbpasswd -a kovica\n\nWith this command you set a password to user kovica. This is the password client has to use while authenticating.\n\nA: With NFS, it is something like this:\nmount -t nfs machine2:/path/to/data /opt/exhibitor/conf/\n\nThis supposes that machine2 is defined in your /etc/host or DNS or you have to enter its IP address (assuming it is static.)\nBy editing your /etc/fstab, you can make it \"permanent\" as in each time you reboot it is there:\nmachine2:/path/to/data    /opt/exhibitor/conf   nfs    rsize=8192,wsize=8192,timeo=14,intr\n\nThe parameters are defined in the manual for nfs and mount:\nman mount\nman nfs\n\nNote that I would imagine that one of the machines does not use the NFS mount since it itself has the \"exhibitor\" data.\nOne possible drawback from NFS, I have not used it in a long time, but when I did a while back, if a target machine goes down, reading or writing on that mount point blocks the application trying. And that's a low level kernel block which completely prevents even a KILL from terminating the process accessing the NFS. I would hope that was fixed with time, but you'd want to test to see what happens. The Samba solution is safer in that respect as it makes use of Network traffic and it is non-blocking, however, I find it hard to setup on my end... Another things I never used is an SSH based connection (opposed to NFS). I have never used it, I tested once, it works... You can create a tunnel and then use the tunnel to mount a directory. Very practical and also does not block like NFS. Plus all the traffic is encrypted. However it may be slower (Frankly with the fast servers we have today... you should be fine.)\n", "Q: Brother WLAN Scanner DCP-7055W not working (\"invalid argument\") I'm having trouble getting the scanner of my Brother DCP-7055W working over WLAN.

I also tried to explicitly pass all other arguments that scanimage -h returned for the scanner, but without success.\nInstalling libsane-extras, as suggested here did not change anything.\nFollowing the troubleshooting of a similar problem, I've run\n# strace -o strace.out -f scanimage -T\n\nAt the end of the output, there's the following:\n4019  ioctl(151, USBDEVFS_SUBMITURB or USBDEVFS_SUBMITURB32, 0xbfbfe0a8) = -1 ENOENT (No such file or directory)\n4019  gettimeofday({1387487538, 170759}, NULL) = 0\n4019  ioctl(151, USBDEVFS_SUBMITURB or USBDEVFS_SUBMITURB32, 0xbfbfe0a8) = -1 ENOENT (No such file or directory)\n4019  gettimeofday({1387487538, 170926}, {4294967236, 0}) = 0\n4019  gettimeofday({1387487538, 171013}, {4294967236, 0}) = 0\n4019  gettimeofday({1387487538, 171104}, NULL) = 0\n4019  ioctl(151, USBDEVFS_SUBMITURB or USBDEVFS_SUBMITURB32, 0xbfbfe068) = -1 ENOENT (No such file or directory)\n4019  write(2, \"scanimage: sane_start: Invalid a\"..., 40) = 40\n4019  ioctl(151, USBDEVFS_CONTROL or USBDEVFS_CONTROL32, 0xbfbfe2e0) = 5\n4019  ioctl(151, USBDEVFS_RELEASEINTERFACE, 0xbfbfe304) = 0\n4019  semop(1245186, {{0, 1, SEM_UNDO}}, 1) = 0\n4019  semctl(1245186, 0, IPC_64|IPC_RMID, 0xbfbfe2b8) = 0\n4019  close(151)                        = 0\n4019  munmap(0xb755a000, 134532)        = 0\n4019  munmap(0xb7525000, 104424)        = 0\n4019  munmap(0xb751b000, 38084)         = 0\n4019  munmap(0xb74ef000, 176256)        = 0\n4019  exit_group(4)                     = ?\n\nThe whole log is full of ioctl calls referring to USBDEFVS_SUBMITURB and getting a No such file or directory.

With the intention of then moving to 13.10.\nI am up to date with other software updates.\nUsing the Update Manager I am offered to upgrade the release, but this is offering an upgrade to 13.10 instead of the expected 13.04.\nWhen selecting upgrade this does in fact attempt to upgrade to 13.10 'Saucy', the application tells me off for doing so, rightly so, and sends me away.\nAny ideas how I can upgrade to 13.04 firstly?\n\nA: You have to use update-manager-core from quantal-updates instead of quantal-proposed.\nSee: I don't know how to upgrade 12.10 to 13.04 or 13.10\n\nA: The definitive situation around this is that the update-manager package does not support upgrades to saucy .. well, as of today.  \nMaybe it did so in the past, and maybe it may do so again in future.  But as of April 2014 this tool does not support upgrades to saucy.  Perhaps this may be on account of the EOL'ing of Raring (13.04) .. and perhaps also the need for a direct upgrade from 12.10 to 13.10.\nThe only thing that worked for me was:\n\n\n*\n\n*s/quantal/saucy/ in /etc/apt/sources.list\n\n*apt-get update\n\n*apt-get dist-upgrade\n\n\nA: This will what you should do:\nsudo apt-get -y dist-upgrade\n\nthis will upgrade all of your dependency files, easier that way before upgrading to Saucy.  This next command will enable you to move on up to Saucy:\nsudo do-release-upgrade\n\nthen that will fire off the process.  Good luck!\n\nA: This is expected, but not so early. Raring will be EOL (End Of Life) from January 2014 onwards, but Quantal (which you are using) will be still supported until April 2014. So, what the release team did:\n\nSo instead the supported upgrade path will be 12.10->13.10->14.04, starting from January.\n\nYou might be feeling this. They probably (I haven't found the sources yet) activated this from the server side before hand. I don't know if such behavior could be tweaked (from client side) and I wouldn't experiment with it. You can try the upgrade, if it works, great! If it doesn't, please report a bug. Make sure to make backups of all your stuff before upgrading!\nRelated:\n\n\n*\n\n*https://askubuntu.com/a/368099/169736\n\nA: I had the same problem and this is how I managed to upgrade 12.10 to 13.04 instead of 13.10:\n1) Open release-upgrades file: sudo gedit /etc/update-manager/release-upgrades\n2) You should have Prompt=normal, this mode upgrades to release that immediately succeeds the currently-running release.\n3) Run upgrade using sudo do-release-upgrade\nThis way I now have 13.04, not 13.10.\n", "Q: How do I configure mount for my new hard drive?

That way we wouldn't need to log in to the Ubuntu One website and we could share music through the desktop client.\nIs there any way to do this?\n\nA: You cannot use multiple accounts with a single local user on the system. You will need a separate local on your system, logged into another Ubuntu One account with the client, to have a client which syncs with a different account than your normal user is.\nHowever, instead, you (or any one of your friends) could simply share a single folder to everyone else, and allow them write access as well, if you wish to synchronize a single common folder between everyone. Whoever owns the folder will have any space usage in that folder, deducted from their account's quota.

Run glxgears again and compare your results with the previous test. If everything went smooth you should be having higher FPS now.\nIf this didn't worked, you can check the following thread: Can't install ATI proprietary drivers in 12.10\n\nA: Did you compare your new card with your onboard card to see what the difference in hardware should be? \nTo my knowledge, the Radeon 5450 isn't a great GPU nowadays. So your onboard graphics may actually be better, depending on the motherboards age.\nI see your CPU is a tad old too, so remember the GPU can't do more than the CPU can tell it to do.\nHope this explains some of it.\n\nA: There are newer versions of the Gallium driver, OpenGL and mesa that you could install.\nLatest OpenGL is 3.1 but you are using 2.1.

So it's not supported...  But there are many elements I have questions for.   First off, the phone has a setting to choose from which of the two sim cards to use.  And then the prop editor built into it can make the phone say it's something that its not.  Such as swapping the build.prop with the prop of another device,  by just bluetooth detection.  It has an extended antenna that sticks out for extended range, I'm assuming.  It has 16Gb of space.  It has a separate memory space For the system.  It even has 2gigs of swap that isn't on the 16 gigs of space.  The screen resolution sucks and the camera sucks too.  But the cpu power is crazy.  It claims it has 1.5ghz and 1024mb of ram.  I could run three game boys and game link them via bluetooth to this phone as the server while using bluetooth connection to a wiimote for a controller while running Spotify.  It has 2 headphone jacks and 2 mini USB ports.  One port is in plain sight while the other is underneath the battery cover.

I installed Ubuntu Studio from a Live USB, alongside Windows 8.1, but encountered this problem -- with help I was able to at least get into the new OS. Now the second half of the problem (that Grub isn't working in the first place) is almost a separate issue, so I've created a separate question and hopefully I can provide more information than at first.\nI got into the OS as described in the answer to this question:\n$ linux (hd0,gpt8)/boot/vmlinuz-3.11.0-14-generic.efi.signed root=/dev/sda8\n$ initrd (hd0,gpt8)/boot/initrd.img-3.11.0-14-generic\n$ boot\n\nOnce I was in, I did more research to find a solution to the overall issue, and I thought I had found it in the answer to this question: I booted into my live USB, and ran these commands, and got output as follows.\nubuntu-studio@ubuntu-studio:~$ mkdir tmp\nubuntu-studio@ubuntu-studio:~$ sudo mount /dev/sda8 /home/ubuntu-studio/tmp\nubuntu-studio@ubuntu-studio:~$ sudo grub-install --root-directory=/home/ubuntu-studio/tmp /dev/sda\n/usr/sbin/grub-bios-setup: warning: this GPT partition label contains no BIOS Boot Partition; embedding won't be possible.\n/usr/sbin/grub-bios-setup: warning: Embedding is not possible.

During the installation I select my normal hard drive as the location to write to but it won't boot without the flash drive still in.

I could try installing by CD.\n\nA: Solved. Everything was installing to the selected hard drive except for the Grub boot loader. During the installation process it can only install it to the system's first hard drive and if you have a wonky situation where you need to switch the USB to be the first drive in order to get the installation process going then you're in trouble in the case of Ubuntu Server.

But at least it worked. I\n\n\n*\n\n*Acquired a dead HDTV motherboard to connect a fake display via HDMI (one to the first VGA card, not all of them)\n\n*Installed TeamViewer (I really hate this, especially on Linux, but...) and made a remote connection\n\n*Opened a terminal with CTRL+ALT+T and issued these commands:\nexport DISPLAY=:0\n./amd_fglrx_installer.run\n\n\n*went through the direct install method via the graphical installer (instead of building *.deb packages -> this is why SSH won't cut it and why I needed a graphical remote desktop)\n\n*Issued in the same terminal (where DISPLAY=:0 remained active, repeat the export command otherwise):\namdconfig --adapter=all --initial\nreboot\n\nAfter Ubuntu booted, cgminer sees every OpenCL device and can monitor/control them via ADL. It runs slightly better on the Ubuntu 14.04 nightly than it did on Windows 8.1 (higher GPU/RAM clock rates are more stable and I can use higher concurrency parameters without running out of the system RAM).\nNote that I need to start cgminer in a terminal windows inside the TeamViewer graphical remote desktop and also issue the DISPLAY:=0 export in advance. It still doesn't work through SSH.\nI am not sure if at least one of these steps are redundant but this is how I finally got it working. And to be honest, it's not exactly a headless machine now. I am not sure if I am free to remove the HDMI cable from the first VGA card now, or I need to keep that plugged in. I don't have the courage to mess everything up by trying. :)\nI am still searching for a way to get rid of TeamViewer because it causes ~50% load on both CPU cores even when I do not connect any clients to the server. But xrdp doesn't seem to work at all with fglrx (I don't see the desktop, just a black background with an X as a cursor).\nAlso note that I used a nightly build. I think older stable versions will do just fine. I was just on a row of \"try everything\" and I ended up using this Ubuntu build when I accidentally got it working.

I ended up disabling the tapping, but I can not get used to this. \nI also tried to control it through changing the values by xinput --set-prop, but it disabled my touchpad.\nThere must be another solution for this !\nHow to solve this ?\n\nA: It took me a while, but I now remember when I last experienced exactly this issue.  There is a known bug with many touch-pads and certain power supplies, especially on circuits where CFL lights are being used.\nTo test this, just unplug your power cord from your computer and try using the touch pad.  \nIf things are now smooth, you have a power conditioning problem.  If you are unable to find an alternative \"cleaner\" AC circuit, then you'll need to add a power conditioner to the circuit you are trying to use; or get rid of all CFLs on that circuit.\n", "Q: Mount my Webserver as a drive in Win7/8 For a variety of reasons I still have a couple of Windows machines around (ver 7 and 8.1). They are still my primary machines. However, I've been running a couple of Ubuntu 12.04 desktops for a while now (9.04 before 12.04). They are my primary dev machines and they are on my LAN.\nI also have a few Ubuntu 12.04 server machines serving webpages (WAN). One is my primary web server while the others house backups and DB info that has gotten large enough to require it's own server so the server serving webpages doesn't get bogged down.\nLong story short, I still spend most of my time in front of my Windows machines even when doing dev for my Ubuntu machines. I grew up coding in Crimson Editor and still prefer it for my coding in PHP (and occasionally Ruby). (I know there are probably 20 better coding GUIs out there that if I just took the time to learn... suggestions are welcome.) Right now I'd like to move my dev work to an underutilized WAN server.\nCrimson Editor will open files via FTP but it is a pain for several reason. Ideally I'd be able to map my WAN Ubuntu server's web directory to a drive letter on my Windows machines. Then I could use File Explorer, drag & drop, etc. natively in Windows without all the slow down and PITA of going through Crimson's FTP functionality.\nMy research to date suggested there were programs for doing this with Win 7 and Ubuntu 10.10 but that they were a little flacky - i.e. dropped and corrupted info. Obviously having my code dropped or corrupted in transit is less than ideal.\nIs there a way to do this reliably? If so, what are security concerns? I have Iptables setup but the IP address of my home connection is dynamic not static. So I'd prefer to not have to deal with that.\nThanks\n\nA: This looks like the perfect opportunity to get yourself familiarized with version control software. In addition to keeping your code safe, allowing to undo things even after weeks or months, it will also solve your problem with keeping your code on a server and nevertheless being able to work on it from your favorite machine.\nI personally am very fond of using git, but there are lots of other version control systems, like svn and mercurial.\nWhile those system differ in lots of details, the very basics are the same. You have a local working copy on the machine you are working on – with git, this local copy is also a full-fledged repository with the complete history, but again, details – and a (remote) repository with all changes ever made. Once you've finished the bit you are working on, you commit those changes from your local working copy to your repository. From that point in time you can delete your working copy, modify it to your liking and always return to the commited version.\nAt least for svn and git, there are shell extensions for the Windows Explorer that make commiting changes easy even for people completely new to this.\n", "Q: Unable to update ubuntu 12.04 \nCould not initialize the package information\nAn unresolvable problem occurred while initializing the package information.\nPlease report this bug against the 'update-manager' package and include the following error message:\n\nE:Encountered a section with no Package: header, \nE:Problem with MergeList /var/lib/apt/lists/dl.google.com_linux_earth_deb_dists_stable_main_i18n_Translation-pt%5fBR, \nE:As listas de pacotes ou o ficheiro de status não pôde ser analisado ou aberto.\n\n\nA: Delete the mergelists: \nsudo rm -rf /var/lib/apt/lists/*\n\nThen run the package list update again:\nsudo apt-get update\n\nAnd update your system:\nsudo apt-get upgrade\n\n", "Q: Syncevolution (syncevo-dbus-server) autostart in 13.10 As stated in this bug, there are 2 files missing in 13.04 and in 13.10: \n/usr/lib/syncevolution/syncevo-dbus-server-startup.sh\n/etc/xdg/autostart/syncevo-dbus-server.desktop\n\nbecause of what syncevo autostart does not work.

I had a Zpanel Server installed on the \"free tier\" plan, and my MySQL became very unstable.\nSometimes the best solution could be install all over again. (usually I try to make a snapshop, as soon as I have the server up and running)\nWell, the other solution, could be only reinstall the MySQL.\nUsually this problem appear when you try to change something in the /etc/mysql/my.cnf.\nTo fix it (works most of time), you will need to follow some steps (these step will try to normalize the MySQL instance)\n\n\n*\n\n*First, try to reboot the server (if it doesn't work, follow to the next steps):\n\n\n*\n\n*sudo reboot\n\n\n*Other steps:\n\n\n*\n\n*First, create a backup from you MySQL folder var/lib/mysql/, just to make sure your data will be safe:\n\n*sudo -i\n\n*cp -R /var/lib/mysql/ ~/mysql\n\n\n*After that, remove/purge MySQL (this will remove: php5-mysql, phpmyadmin and other libraries, so after the procedure, you will have to reinstall again.\n\n\n*\n\n*sudo apt-get purge mysql-server-5.1 mysql-common\n\n\n*Remove the folder /etc/mysql/ and its content:\n\n\n*\n\n*sudo rm /etc/mysql/ -R\n\n\n*Later on, check if the database files are still in the folder /var/lib/mysql/ and if they are not, then copy it back:\n\n\n*\n\n*\nmkdir /var/lib/mysql/\nchown root:root /var/lib/mysql/ -R\ncd ~/mysql/\ncp * /var/lib/mysql/ -R\n\n\n\n*Okay, then install o mysql server again\n\n\n*\n\n*apt-get install mysql-server\n\n\n*And finally install phpmyadmin and php5-mysql:\n\n\n*\n\n*apt-get install php5-mysql\napt-get install phpmyadmin\n\n\n\n*At last, restart the services and check if the status are okay now:\n\n\n*\n\n*\nservice apache2 restart\nservice mysql restart\n\nThat's it! It should work. I hope it works for you! (don't worry about the old data.That's why we have backup it first)\n\nA: In my case the problem turned out to be that I had no hard disk space left available.  A log file had grown to epic proportions and I couldn't start MySQL due to lack of available space.  Once I cleaned up the file and restarted, it worked fine.\n", "Q: How to know the motherboard BIOS version using the command line How can get the BIOS version of my motherboard?\nThe command dmidecode gives you some information about the BIOS, but I can't find what I need...\n\nI tried dmidecode command before asking and I didn't find what I needed - I want only the BIOS version and nothing else in the output.\n\nA: I got the solution.\nUsing dmidecode (of course), but the problem was with the result... \nI don't want to list block result about my bios I just need the version..\nThe command is:\nsudo dmidecode -s bios-version\n\nThe output will just print the version:\n\nSIX7910J.86A.0537.2012.0723.1217\n\n\nA: dmidecode usually returns, amongst other things, a block with information about your BIOS.

First of all, I'm very new to Linux but I don't think this is a \"Linux ate my RAM\" issue. While searching about my problem I ran in to that issue a lot but it doesn't fit with what I see. This seems to be really happening.\nEverything I've tried is telling me that the RAM usage is very very high. I've tried top, htop, vmstat 2 10. My Hypanel admin page too (this is a VPS that I access remotely). Also I have started to get errors stating that it cannot allocate memory to whatever I'm trying to do, even opening a terminal. It didn't even have enough RAM to allow me to logout of Ubuntu at one point.\nThe VPS has 1gb of RAM. It's not a lot but from everything I have read it should be more than enough to run, particularly when I have basically no traffic going through it. I have setup Apache2 and added 2 domain names pointing to their own html folders. I can access the domains. For example: t4nk.com\nI then installed some recommended things like modsecurity, fail2ban, MySQL, and tried to install PHP5 which didn't work (probably because it couldn't allocate memory), but this may be irrelevant because the RAM usage apparently started last month before I did much of anything, as you'll see in the screenshots below. The first shot is just the general info from Hypanel.\n\nIn the next screenshot you can see that the RAM usage spikes back up immediately after turning off the VPS for a few minutes:\n\nAnd when I view the RAM usage from last month I can see that it all went bad after changing from CentOS 5 to Ubuntu 12.04. The reason that I changed to Ubuntu was that I thought it would be easier for a newbie like me to use, but honestly I haven't gained much from having a GUI and I spend most of my time in the terminal just like I did on CentOS.\nLast month RAM usage: \n\ntop: \n\nhtop: \n\nvmstat 2 10: \n\nI don't really know what vmstat does, but it was recommended in one of the many threads I read on my many searches for a solution. I hope someone can help me out here. Please keep in mind that I'm very new to Linux.\nHow to resolve this ?\n\nA: Your RAM usage looks totally normal, given the fact that you are running a GUI, Apache and mySQL on a box with only 1GB of RAM.\nWhile the use for Apache and mySQL is rather obvious, installing complete desktop environments on a server – like Xfce on yours – is seldom useful and only wastes precious resources.\nUbuntu is as capable of being adminstrated from the command line as any other Linux distribution and I highly recommend you do so.\n", "Q: I need to upgrade 8.10 to 13.10 Update computer to latest version but the version we have is 8.10 and it is not upgrading to version 13.10. I message I see is \"server error\". I dont know how to update in another way.\n\nA: By far the easiest way of upgrading that box is backing up the relevant user data, creating a USB stick (or DVD) for Ubuntu 13.10 and installing a new system.\nOtherwise, you would have to upgrade to 9.04, 9.10, 10.04, 12.04, 12.10, 13.04 and then finally to 13.10. All the releases before 12.04 have long reached their EOL and are no longer supported, thus upgrading to them will likely require manual intervention or might even be straight out impossible. Even if you would be willing to try doing so, keep in mind that each of those upgrade steps will take about as long as a fresh install.\ntl;dr: Don't upgrade, reinstall.\n", "Q: Ubuntu cannot detect Windows 7 so I cannot dual-boot I wanted to dual boot my Windows 7 (x64) with Ubuntu 13.10 (x64). When I get to the stage when I select a partition, it says that Ubuntu does not detect any other operating system in my computer. I chose 'Something else' and the only partition that came up was 'free space' with 500 GB free space (my hard drive space). I set two partitions before installing Ubuntu. 414 GB for Windows 7 and 50 GB for Ubuntu.\nMy disk is not Dynamic.\n\nA: \nFrom the screenshot,it was clearly shown that you accidentally deleted the previously installed Windows partition.\nSo exit the ubuntu installer and create new partitions for windows and Ubuntu using Gparted Partition Editor.\nAfter that run the ubuntu installer then choose \"something else\" option and select the created ext4 partition for installing Ubuntu.And don't forget to create a swap partition of size which was double the RAM size(applicable for 1 or 2 GB RAM).\n\nA: If you need to recover data from that disk try to do so BEFORE INSTALLING ANOTHER OS.

After booting my computer, gdm displays as expected and I can choose which account to log in to. However, if I then log out, I do not get the login screen any more, with instead just some text, similar to the problem described in here.\nAfter logging out, I've found that Xorg is taking 100% CPU, and killing this process causes gdm to start up as usual again. One hacky solution I have found is to restart gdm after a session has finished by adding\nkillall -9 Xorg\n\nto /etc/gdm/PostSession/Default.\nI'm using the nVidia proprietary driver on a laptop, with the laptop screen switched off and two external monitors (maybe a little unusual). A similar problem is described in here, but this solution does not fix the problem.\nSo my question is, has anybody experienced this or something similar? What is the cause? And is there a better solution than just killing Xorg at the end of every session?\n\nA: Using the NVIDIA 331 driver from ppa:ubuntu-x-swat/x-updates solved this problem.\nNVIDIA 304 driver also solved this problem but a Xorg crash report is appeared.\n(Ubuntu GNOME 13.10, GNOME 3.8)\n", "Q: Ubuntu 12.04 LTS Network Icon Mistaken After some diagonic processure, I've found that my wireless network has not yet resolved but my wired connection has mistaken the wrong icon.\neth0      Link encap:Ethernet  HWaddr 20:6a:8a:3f:70:90  \n          inet addr:172.29.2.181  Bcast:172.29.15.255  Mask:255.255.240.0\n          inet6 addr: fe80::226a:8aff:fe3f:7090/64 Scope:Link\n          UP BROADCAST RUNNING MULTICAST  MTU:1500  Metric:1\n          RX packets:3328 errors:0 dropped:0 overruns:0 frame:0\n          TX packets:1414 errors:0 dropped:0 overruns:0 carrier:0\n          collisions:0 txqueuelen:1000 \n          RX bytes:1324723 (1.3 MB)  TX bytes:260711 (260.7 KB)\n          Interrupt:19 \n\nlo        Link encap:Local Loopback  \n          inet addr:127.0.0.1  Mask:255.0.0.0\n          inet6 addr: ::1/128 Scope:Host\n          UP LOOPBACK RUNNING  MTU:16436  Metric:1\n          RX packets:79866 errors:0 dropped:0 overruns:0 frame:0\n          TX packets:79866 errors:0 dropped:0 overruns:0 carrier:0\n          collisions:0 txqueuelen:0 \n          RX bytes:10583710 (10.5 MB)  TX bytes:10583710 (10.5 MB)\n\nWARNING: you should run this program as super-user.\n  *-network UNCLAIMED     \n       description: Network controller\n       product: AR9287 Wireless Network Adapter (PCI-Express)\n       vendor: Qualcomm Atheros\n       physical id: 0\n       bus info: pci@0000:03:00.0\n       version: 01\n       width: 64 bits\n       clock: 33MHz\n       capabilities: cap_list\n       configuration: latency=0\n       resources: memory:f1600000-f160ffff\n  *-network\n       description: Ethernet interface\n       product: NetLink BCM57785 Gigabit Ethernet PCIe\n       vendor: Broadcom Corporation\n       physical id: 0\n       bus info: pci@0000:04:00.0\n       logical name: eth0\n       version: 10\n       serial: 20:6a:8a:3f:70:90\n       size: 100Mbit/s\n       capacity: 1Gbit/s\n       width: 64 bits\n       clock: 33MHz\n       capabilities: bus_master cap_list rom ethernet physical tp 10bt 10bt-fd 100bt 100bt-fd 1000bt 1000bt-fd autonegotiation\n       configuration: autonegotiation=on broadcast=yes driver=tg3 driverversion=3.123 duplex=full firmware=sb ip=172.29.2.181 latency=0 multicast=yes port=twisted pair speed=100Mbit/s\n       resources: irq:19 memory:f1400000-f140ffff memory:f1410000-f141ffff memory:f1450000-f14507ff\n\nWARNING: output may be incomplete or inaccurate, you should run this program as super-user.\nAnyone can help?\nAccording to Chili555, I've tried modprobe ath9k && dmesg | grep ath\n[339970.692404] ath: phy0: Chip reset failed\n[339970.692409] ath: phy0: Unable to reset hardware;

However I'm still interested to interpret the output of fdisk -l above?\n\nA: The disk has just 250GB, if you look at the start and end cylinders, you'll see that they are the same.\n/dev/sda2 is just an extended partition, which is a fancy way of saying 'a container for other partitions'. Contained in that extended partition is an LVM volume (/dev/sda5), which in turn holds your data.\nExtended partitions are a workaround for the inability of hard disks with MS-DOS type partition tables to hold more than 4 partition entries. With GPT, there's no need for them anymore.\n\nA: /dev/sda2              32       30402   243947521    5  Extended\n/dev/sda5              32       30402   243947520   8e  Linux LVM\n\nAs you can see, sda2 is an extended partition and starts at 32. sda5 starts at 32, too.\nNormaly you can just have up to 4 primary partitions on your disk (btw: Does anyone knows the reason?)\nA extended partition is something like a \"container\" in which you can create more partitions.\nSo sda5 is a partition inside sda2.\nBut since sda5 takes all space in sda2 (you can see it at start and endpoints), I think sda2 is more or less useless and you could move sda5 outside if sda2 and then remove sda2. But I don't know if, and how, this is possible\n\nA: Because /dev/sda2 is an Extended partition, it is not actually usable for data storage. You'll note that both /dev/sda2 and /dev/sda5 in the list, have the same values under the Start and End columns, and only differ in Blocks by one. Extended partitions are used to allow creating more partitions than would normally be allowed in the partition table. The fdisk (and similar) application does not show it well, but in your case, /dev/sda5 is actually inside the /dev/sda2 partition.\n", "Q: How do I get vim to indent all HTML tags? I was using vim on Debian 7 to edit an HTML document. I started typing: <HTML>Return…\nAfter the initial return, the cursor was indented one level, so that as I typed <head>, and the rest of my document, it would show up like this:\n<!doctype html>\n<html>\n    <head>\n        <meta charset=\"utf-8\">\n        <title>Test page</title>\n    </head>\n    <body>\n        <div>\n            <p>This is a paragraph.</p>\n        </div>\n    </body>\n</html>\n\nThe tag on each line was simply followed by a Return and no presses on the Tab or Space key, and vim formatted this as I expected. Also, when typing the initial </ of a closing tag, vim would unindent that line so as to match the level of the corresponding opening tag.\nThen, typing the same document into vim on Ubuntu 13.10, as I'm typing the very same document in the same manner, I get the following results:\n<!doctype html>\n<html>\n<head>\n<meta charset=\"utf-8\">\n<title>Test page</title>\n</head>\n<body>\n<div>\n    <p>This is a paragraph.</p>\n</div>\n</body>\n</html>\n\nNotice that the indentation doesn't start until the <p> tag, and I suppose any of its subsequent sibling and child elements. It seems that later versions of the HTML indentation style have opted to not indent tags such as html, head, body, etc.(?), for legibility.\nI don't like the fact that vim doesn't indent all tags. What can I do to change this?\nI tried looking at the indentation files for the different versions, but I didn't manage to figure out if I could do anything there. pastebins:\n\n\n*\n\n*/usr/share/vim/vim73/indent/html.vim on Debian 7\n\n*/usr/share/vim/vim74/indent/html.vim on Ubuntu 13.10\nI'm using the following versions of vim:\n\n\n*\n\n*Debian 7: \"Vi IMproved 7.3 (2010 Aug 15, compiled Feb 10 2013 02:27:59)\"\n\n*Ubuntu 13.10: \"Vi IMproved 7.4 (2013 Aug 10, compiled Aug 12 2013 00:28:05)\"\n\n\nA: Make sure you have the full vim installed:\nsudo apt-get install vim\n\nThen make a file named ~/.vimrc with the following contents:\nfiletype plugin indent on\n\nThen it should work.\nUPDATE (source of the update)\nIn the 7.4 version the indentation file was changed, that is what causing problems. The new indentation doesn't indent every html tag, but you can specify which tags to indent by using:\n:let g:html_indent_inctags = \"html,body,head,tbody\"\n\nin vim, or without the : in ~/.vimrc as always. (Of course put those tags in the list which you want to be indented.)\nOr you can just swap back the older version of indent file in place of the newer one. In 12.04 the old indent file is located in /usr/share/vim/vim73/indent/html.vim so I guess for the 7.4 version the file is located in /usr/share/vim/vim74/indent/html.vim. Or to override it only for your user and keep it safe from updates put it in ~/.vim/indent/html.vim \n", "Q: Help with Chromium Extension In Opera I use some scripts to change the style of webpages to improve readability after they have loaded. \nHow can I implement these scripts in Chromium using an extension, or can I make a extension which will do this?\n\nA: you can use greasemonkey script extension in chrome.\nFor more information & usage  www.howtogeek.com \nOne more similar add-on to that Tampermonkey\n", "Q: How do I configure NetworkManager to connect to two separate VPN servers simultaneously?

I have it configured that when running Network Connect it will run the 32 bit version and for anything else the 64 bit version.\nI can get Network Connect to start when going to the site (I have x32 versions of firefox and icedtea-plugin), but right after it launches it crashes. The timer on the Network Connect will sometimes goto 00:00:01, but never to 00:00:02 before crashing.\nThe error report:\nThe crashed program seems to use third-party or local libraries:\n/home/user/.juniper_networks/network_connect/libncui.so\nIt is highly recommended to check if the problem persists without those first.\nDo you want to continue the report process anyway?\n\nThe error occurs with the 32 bit Java, not with the 64 bit.

It's encrypted, am I right? ;) So it is mounted with a \"nosetuid\" option, that prevents any SUID Operations to work as you expect them.\nSolution: copy your network-connect directory somewhere else on your HDD (i.e. /opt/juniperconnect)), edit the junipernc-script to point to the new directory (called _jpath in the script /usr/local/bin/junipernc ), and then it works for me. I'm still using nc version 7.1 with Ubuntu 14.04 LTS.\n\nA: I had the exact same problem and it was due to HOME directory being encrypted, just like hmayag pointed out. Copying the whole $HOME/.juniper_connect out to an unencrypted place solved the issue (and editing the _jpath variable in the junipernc.sh to point to the new location).

When you apply system-wide, the variables are written to /etc/default/locale.\nThe reason why LC_MESSAGES, LC_CTYPE and LC_COLLATE are not set explicitly is that LANG is set, and the locale name in LANG is inherited by those three LC_* variables.

I've got Ubuntu 12.10 and by instaling AirDroid, you can access and control your mobile phone from your desktop.\nThere are two modes:\n\n*\n\n*One using a central site where you conect and.. bla bla, we guys don't care... but works ok!!\n\n\n*The other one is by using mobile phone IP granted by your Wi Fi network, open web broswser on PC and type http://phoneIPaddress:8888  This way your browser will handle the phone... voila\nInstalling\n\n*\n\n*To install AirDroid go to GooglePlay, install it to your android\ndevice,\n\n\n*Run it from your device and copy the IP showed on your\nscreen\n\n\n*On your desktop web browser, type:\nhttp://IP:8888\nThis will open the android screen, that is all.\nI recomend using bluetooth headseat for phone calls, this way the PC initiate the call the rest is between the phone and the bluetooth headset.  Got one from amazon for less than U$5 and headset cost me around U$30, the more expensive headset were really disappointing.\nHope this helps.\n\nA: Yes. The smartphone just provides an IP connection to and from the web (and some carriers, like Virgin Mobile USA, block VOIP traffic- be warned).\n\n\n*\n\n*If you have a Google account you can add Google Voice for free, dial\nin the Chrome or Chromium browsers with Google Voice (free in the US\net Canada) and then use the microphone and speaker of your machine.\nThere was an extension for Firefox years ago, but no longer. Here's a review and a critique. Been using it since 2007 and it works reliably, with no commercials, even though free.\n\n*You can also add a SIP client like Linphone or SFLphone among others and use VOIP providers such as CallCentric. You get what you pay for with VOIP providers, but I've been happy with CallCentric.

I have a Asus S56C here's an overview of my hardware tell me if you can help.\nhttp://imageshack.us/a/img706/8903/p58r.png\nI'm really sick of windows.\n\nA: All the hardware looks like it should run fine in Ubuntu 12.04 or 13.10.\nIf you are unsure why I mention these two versions:\n12.04 - Long term support, supported until April 2017. Best if you don't mind about being on the cutting edge with new features, but instead you want to not have to update every 6months-1year.\n13.10 - Current version, newest features are here. You will have to upgrade again by July 2014 as this is not long term supported.\nI suggest 12.04 but that is a personal thing. The things that go wrong most often (in my experience) are wifi drivers because many vendors don't give linux updates.\nYour best bet is to make a Live USB (with either 12.04 or 13.10, make sure you get the 64Bit version) and give Ubuntu a try. Check your wifi works, and then if you like it either set up a dual boot or wipe off windows and put on Ubuntu (You can install from this live USB)\n\nA: This is more of an opinion based question but it looks like your hardware would work fine with Ubuntu. Make sure you do a backup of your machine just in case you want to put Windows back on. You should install a 64-bit version of Ubuntu because your computer is using 64-bit i7 architecture. The intel series processors perform just as well as AMD core in my opinion. The Solid State Drive will make the computer a lot faster. Ubuntu boots in just a couple of seconds on my SSD.\nIf you don't like Unity, the default window manager, you can install xfce which kind of looks like Windows. If you like the way the start menu has all of your stuff in it, then I would go with xfce. Xfce is super lightweight so it will run very quickly, but in my opinion it looks a little boring compared to Unity. Again, it's all your preference.\nIf you want to give it a try:\n\n\n*\n\n*How can I install XFCE along side unity?\n", "Q: Can't solve: ext4 file system creation failure Ubuntu 12.04 This seems to have been covered a lot before, but none of the solutions seem to help.\nIt's the usual getting this error message while installing.\nThe ext4 file system creation in partition #1 of SCSI1 (0,0,0) (sda) failed\n\nI'm trying to install 12.04 on a brand new HDD in a reasonably old laptop though it should have plenty good enough specs.

But with HP discontinuing the TouchPad and all webOS smartphones, the future of the operating system remains uncertain. Fortunately you may not be stuck with webOS… or at least not only with webOS.\nProjects are already underway to port Google Android to run on the TouchPad. The open source operating system already supports devices with similar hardware, but it could be a while before we see fully usable versions that work with HP’s camera, WiFi, and other hardware.\nUpdate: It’s now possible to install Android on the HP TouchPad, thanks to the folks behind the popular CyanogenMod Android software. \nIn the meantime, hackers have already figured out how to run Ubuntu Linux on the TouchPad. The process is a bit complicated, and what you actually end up doing is partitioning the storage space on the tablet, installing Ubuntu alongside webOS, and then choosing which to run.\nHere are the steps you’ll need to take to do that:\n1. Install Preware \nPreWare is a repository system (or app store) for homebrew apps and utilities that aren’t available from the webOS App Catalog. It’s a great resource even if you don’t plan on installing Ubuntu on your TouchPad.\nMore information about Preware is available in the Preware Homebrew Documentation app for webOS, and you can find several sets of instructions for installing Preware at the WebOS Internals Wiki.\nYou can do this using the official HP software developer kit, using the webOS Quick Install tool, or by using a standalone installer.\n2. Set up Meta-Doctor on your TouchPad\n\n\n*\n\n*Using OS X or Linux you’ll need to install git and Java runtime, install Palm Novacom software, and download the meta-doctor scripts.\n\n*Download and run the webOS Doctor.\n\n*Create an ext3fs partition on your device, making sure it’s large enough for an Ubuntu installation.\n\n*Follow the instructions to mount the ext3fs partition when your device boots. (You can find more instructions at the PreCentral forums).\n\n\n3. UbuntuChroot\n\n\n*\n\n*In PreWare, make sure the WebOS Internals Testing Feeds are enabled.\n\n*Install Xecutah, XServer, and Ubuntu 11.04 CHroot.\n\n*Run XServer.\n\n*Return to Xecutah and tap Ubuntu 11.04 Chroot.\n\n\nThese steps will get you to a command-line version of Ubuntu Linux. From here you can use apt-get install to install Ubuntu packages. For instance, you can install icewm, Xfce or LXDE to give yourself a graphical user interface. Theoretically you could also use GNOME, KDE, or Unity but they require more system resources.\nNot all Ubuntu Linux apps will work on the TouchPad, since the tablet has an ARM-based processor and many Ubuntu apps haven’t yet been compiled for ARM.\nUsers have reported that Firefox, Chromium, and the Flash plugin for those web browsers appear to work though. Other apps reported to work include the LibreOffice office suite, Transmission bittorrent client, and even VNC software for logging into a remote computer.\nYou should also be able to use the webOS on-screen keyboard to type when using Ubuntu. In fact, right now even if you’re using a Bluetooth keyboard the on-screen keyboard shows up, but developers are working on a fix for that.\nThanks to the folks at the PreCentral forums for much of the info!\n\nA: Rather than the Ubuntu desktop, mentioned in previous answer, it is probably better to consider Ubuntu Touch for tablets:\nhttp://forum.xda-developers.com/showthread.php?t=2426924\n", "Q: Can't Install Windows 8, Fedora 19 with Ubuntu 12.04 LTS.

Here is what you need to do:\n1) Install Windows 8 because it will write over the MBR.\n 2) Resize partitions because Windows 8 will want it all\n 3) Install Fedora on the free space\n 4) Repartition again if you didn't leave free space\n 5) Install Ubuntu\nIf you do this all on one single disk you will have a ton of partitions. I think Windows 8 comes with 5 partitions including the Recovery partition. The Recovery partition can be deleted if you have a separate recovery method. Fedora will only need 2 or 3 partitions (if you want / and /home separate you will need separate partitions). Ubuntu will also need 2 or 3 partitions, but Ubuntu and Fedora can share the /home and swap partitions if you get them to play nicely (not easy). Remember that you can only have 4 partitions, with the 4th being an extended partition. I think overall you can have up to 16 partitions. When you get this many partitions, things start to get very sloppy and hard to manage. What you can do is have a partition for boot, temp and swap shared between linux systems (/boot/ and /tmp/) in order to simplify things.\nWhat I did, is on my desktop I just bought more hard drives and put each operating system on a different drive. Now on my laptop I only have room for one Hard drive so what I did is I am running Mac OSX and then running Ubuntu and Fedora in VirtualBox when I need them. They run really good in VirtualBox.\nInstalling 3 operating systems on one hard drive will be a huge process and it might save you a lot of pain to consider alternate solutions.\n", "Q: How to do a FULL system backup I have been looking around but I cannot seem to find anything that will do a full system backup.

There are probably ways to do it in the terminal but I don't like to do those kind of things in the terminal and would rather have a GUI for this. Does anyone know of an application that can do FULL system backups and if so how?\n\nA: You can use Deja-dup for this. If you want to just backup all of your files, then you just have to set Deja-dup to backup your entire system. Make sure the Deja-dup does not backup your backup location or it will run into problems. If you are backing up to an external hard drive it will probably be mounted under /media/$USER.\nI would recommend creating a system image because it saves all of your partitions and can be used to do a full system restore. It is common practice to do small backups of your home directory every day and then every week create a new system image. This way if your system gets breached, you can just restore a previous system configuration without worrying about your system getting screwed up.\n\nA: Use clonezilla on live CD/USB, its free and powerful.

Some UEFI only boot Windows.

The mongodb packages in ubuntu do not contain SSL support (this is due to a restriction from 10gen, the makers of mongo).  However, you're supposed to be able to build it yourself... but the instructions on mongo's website don't seem to work for Saucy (because of a newer gcc), and aren't clear on all the steps to enable SSL.\n\nA: As the question mentioned, the directions to build mongo on 10gen's website aren't quite correct for newer versions of Ubuntu, and leave out details about SSL. \nHere's what you do:\nsudo apt-get install -y git-core build-essential scons libssl-dev libboost-filesystem-dev libboost-program-options-dev libboost-system-dev libboost-thread-dev \ngit clone git://github.com/mongodb/mongo.git \ncd mongo \ngit checkout r2.4.8\n\nObviously, replace the version here with whatever version you desire.  \nBe aware, there is a bug with the build of mongo, where it doesn't play happily with gcc 4.8 (which is what is in Saucy), see the bug report here - http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=701324.  \nLuckily, in the bug report there is also a patch to fix it, so you need to apply that (it's just two lines): http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?msg=14;filename=0008-ignore-unused-local-typedefs.patch;att=1;bug=701324\nNow you can do the rest:\ncd src\nscons --ssl all \nsudo scons --ssl --prefix=/opt/mongo install\n\nThat's it.

My main OS is Ubuntu 12.04. I have VMWare Player installed and a Windows 7  virtual machine running.\nI'd like to give the Windows virtual machine control over the discrete graphics card. That is, I want to run Windows and its applications using the discrete card.\nRight now I'm using bumblebee to control the discrete card, so I invoked the player using optirun vmplayer. It runs fine, but I think it's still using the integrated graphics: neither VMWare nor Windows seems to recognize the existence of the discrete card or of the HDMI output (which is wired directly into the discrete card).\n\nA: VMware Player does not allow for direct hardware connection of pci-e devices. The virtual machine uses an emulated card that is powered by your host graphics cards. If you want to directly connect a graphics card to a virtual machine you can look into other virtualization products that allow for a wider range of physical hardware inputs to a vm such as Parrallels Workstation Extreme, which is very expensive, though I'm not sure if it can assign laptop graphics cards. To get the best graphics card performance in your VM make sure you have \"accelerate 3D graphics\" checked in the vm options, have vmware tools installed in the guest OS, and if host os has any options regarding which graphics device to let a program run on make sure to set vmware player to run from the best graphics device.\nInformation about Assigning PCI-E devices in Parrallels Workstation Extreme:\nhttp://kb.parallels.com/en/9427\n", "Q: Macbook Pro 11,2 - no sound with Ubuntu 13.10 The sound hardware works.

From the looks of it, this will happen regardless of the OS, and the cause may be a misconfiguration in the router. So you can do two things:\n\n\n*\n\n*Configure your router properly. Log into its configuration page (check your manual for this), and configure a static DNS (Google's public DNS is a good choice, use 8.8.8.8, more here). Then have the computer reconfigure its interface via DHCP. You should then be able to properly resolve names.\n\n*Configure the DNS address directly on the computer, bypassing the router. Click on the wireless/network icon on the top bar, then select \"Edit Connections\", grab the connection you're using, click \"Edit\". Then on the \"IPv4 settings\" tab, select \"Automatic (DHCP) addresses only\", and on the (just enabled) DNS Servers field enter 8.8.8.8.\n\n\nTo diagnose which DNS server is resolving your names, open a terminal (ctrl-alt-t) and type dig www.yahoo.com, you should see diagnostic information about where your queries are being sent.\n\nA: Well i had the \"The VPN connection failed due to unsuccessful domain name resolution\" error on my archlinux, now it works for me.\nFirstly I installed openconnect and tried to connect via it.

I did the same thing that you're gonna do but in a little different way. I had 2 partitions on my PC as Windows in C: and important things in D: as usual. Anyway, I created another partition with one of those applications which let you create additional partitions. And after it I had 3 partitions.\nI decided to install Ubuntu on the 3rd partition.

The 32-bit version will, in fact, automatically install a 32-bit EFI bootloader. Unfortunately, Canonical doesn't offer a bootable 32-bit ISO that has an EFI bootloader in the DVD image. So, we must create the install disk ourselves.\nOther instructions try getting 64-bit Ubuntu to run and install. This probably comes from a misconception that EFI requires a 64-bit OS. This is false. In fact, the bitness of the EFI is meant to be tied to the bitness of the OS. Most PCs are designed for 64-bit OSes and therefore have 64-bit EFIs. However, cheap PCs designed for a 32-bit OS have 32-bit EFI.\nKeep in mind, however, that Ubuntu (or rather, its Linux kernel) doesn't fully support the hardware in the systems which typically ship with 32-bit EFI BIOSes (cheap Intel Atom SoCs). WiFi, sound, and power management often do not work. Patched third-party kernels that fix some of the issues do exist, such as those made available here.\nTo prepare an Ubuntu 32-bit install drive with an EFI bootloader:\n\n\n*\n\n*Download both 32bit and 64bit Ubuntu ISOs. (Tested with Ubuntu 15.10)\n\n*Download a multi-arch Debian ISO. (Tested with Debian 8.2.0 netinst ISO)\n\n*Format your USB disk as FAT and mount it\n\n\n*\n\n*In Gnome Disks, select the USB drive in the left list, go to the \"Hamburger Menu\" in the upper-right corner, choose Format Disk, select MSR/DOS partitioning, and Format. Then click '+' and accept defaults which should create a FAT partition. Finally, click the \"play\" triangle to mount it.\n\n\n*Extract installation files from the Ubuntu 32-bit ISO while copying the contents of the symlinks\n\n\n*\n\n*In Gnome Disks, open the Disks menu (up where File and Edit normally are), choose Attach Disk Image, select ubuntu-15.10-desktop-i386.iso, and mount the biggest partition.\n\n*In Terminal, rsync -rL --exclude=/ubuntu <path to Ubuntu 32-bit install disk>/ <path to usb disk>/\n\n\n*\n\n*Replace <placeholders> with the correct paths\n\n*Don't forget the slash at the end of the source path\n\n\n\n*Copy /boot and /EFI directories from an Ubuntu 64-bit ISO\n\n\n*\n\n*Mount the iso\n\n*rsync -r <path to Ubuntu 64-bit install disk>/boot/ <path to usb disk>/boot/\n\n*rsync -r <path to Ubuntu 64-bit install disk>/EFI/ <path to usb disk>/EFI/\n\n\n*\n\n*Again, the slashes at the end are significant\n\n\n\n*Copy 32-bit GRUB from a Debian multi-arch ISO\n\n\n*\n\n*Mount the iso\n\n*cp <path to Debian multi-arch install disk>/efi/boot/bootia32.efi <path to usb disk>/EFI/BOOT/\n\n*rsync -r <path to Debian multi-arch install disk>/boot/grub/i386-efi <path to usb disk>/boot/grub/\n\n\n*\n\n*Watch those slashes (this time the source doesn't end in a slash)\n\n\n\n*Rename vmlinuz to vmlinuz.efi\n\n\n*\n\n*mv <path to usb disk>/casper/vmlinuz <path to usb disk>/casper/vmlinuz.efi\n\n\n*Unmount everything\n\n*Disable Secure Boot on target system and boot from the USB drive. \n\n*Install Ubuntu! (I've tested with \"Erase disk and encrypt it with LVM\" option and the install works automatically--unless the kernel doesn't support the flash chips in the device.)\n\n*System should be \"ready.\" It will boot, but actually it may not be very functional due to lack of drivers (as of Ubuntu 16.04). Check out this Google+ group for more advice and latest patched kernels.\n\n\nA: Broadly speaking, if you need to install Ubuntu (or any other Linux distribution) on a computer with a 32-bit EFI and no BIOS/CSM/legacy-mode boot support, the way to do it is:\n\n\n*\n\n*Use unetbootin or something similar to prepare an installation USB flash drive. (It's possible to get it to work with a CD-R, but this takes more work.)\n\n*Choose an EFI-mode boot loader for Linux. I recommend ELILO, Fedora's patched GRUB Legacy, rEFInd, or gummiboot because they're relatively easy to set up manually. GRUB 2 is far too difficult to configure manually, and SYSLINUX is too new.\n\n*Research your chosen boot loader's configuration file format and its needs in terms of kernel location.\n\n*Check the original CD image to find its boot loader configuration. You need to know what options are being passed to the kernel by the boot loader.\n\n*Add an EFI/BOOT directory to a FAT partition on the USB flash drive that now holds your Linux image. Ideally, this partition should be an ESP (that is, have a \"boot flag\" set in parted or have a type code of EF00 in gdisk if the disk uses GPT; or have a type code of 0xEF in fdisk if the disk uses MBR), but some ESPs can cope without that. If the disk doesn't have a FAT partition, you'll need to create one\n\n*Copy your chosen boot loader's binary file (with a name that ends in .efi) to the EFI/BOOT directory on the USB flash drive, and rename it to bootia32.efi -- that is, it should be EFI/BOOT/bootia32.efi. Be sure to copy the 32-bit version of the boot loader!\n\n*Install any support files that the boot loader needs, such as drivers, images, modules, and configuration files. In some cases (such as ELILO and gummiboot), you'll need to copy your kernel and initrd file to the FAT partition that holds the boot loader.\n\n*Edit the configuration file(s) for your boot loader so that it can launch the kernel with the options you identified earlier by examining the BIOS-mode boot loader's configuration.\n\n*Reboot to test the boot loader.\n\n\nWith any luck it will work and you'll be able  to install everything. I can't guarantee that Ubuntu will install a 32-bit EFI boot loader, though. If not, you'll need to boot an emergency system and set that up manually, too. You may also need to debug something, particularly if unetbootin (or whatever you use) doesn't set up the flash drive in the optimal way.\nOf course, this description is fairly vague about the critical detail of configuring the boot loader. This is because I haven't done it recently (although I have in the past), and the details vary depending on what boot loader you choose.\n\nA: Although Fedora does indeed support 32bit EFI so does MX Linux as direct install and Debian via a net install. \nAlso I have had success using the methods below for intel baytrail/cherrytrail based devices.\nhttp://linuxiumcomau.blogspot.com/2017/06/customizing-ubuntu-isos-documentation.html\nhttps://www.ianrenton.com/guides/install-linux-on-a-linx-1010b-tablet/\nhttps://concretedog.blogspot.com/2018/04/linux-on-linx1010b.html?m=1\nI am currently on Ubuntu Mate 19.04 on my Linx 1010b a everything works fine except the cameras, I am working on that.\n\nA: If you create a bootable ISO on a USB drive with \"unetbootin\" it is possible to place the bootia32 efi image into efi/boot of the ISO you created. This enables booting of a 64 bit Ubuntu ISO on a machine with a hybrid setup i.e. 32 bit uefi and a 64 bit CPU. I have successfully installed Ubuntu Budgie 19.10 on my Linx 1010b (baytrail) and have to say I have not had to tweak anything. Auto-rotation works, touchscreen alignment works, WiFi works I have not checked the webcam yet, although I think that it will be nonfunctional. Onboard is already installed and just has to be configured to get the virtual keyboard working. Performance is acceptable as Budgie is a little lighter on memory than Gnome, the ISO comes with Geary installed as the email client this is good as it it lighter and faster than others I have tried for this device. \nAll in all I am pleased with the result.\n", "Q: The Disk Drive for /tmp is not ready yet.

Got a MacBook Pro, 13 inch, 500gb Hard Drive, 4gb memory. Made a massive screw up on dual install, luckily had already transferred files to Ubuntu one.

I have tried doing the install from the trial desktop, doing the install from boot, and doing the install with OEM. \nEach time, whenever I restart (as required by installation), it just asks me whether I want to install (black screen with list of boot options). Never gives me the option to boot from currently installed Ubuntu.\nI have even tried to take out USB before the restart and it comes up with a flashing file symbol with a magnifying glass in the middle!\n\nA: There is a better way of single installation of Ubuntu on Macs without rEFInd using Mac's bootloader.\nCreate a live USB containing Ubuntu. Do not use the +mac version since it does not support EFI boot.\nBoot from the Live USB. The trick to booting from USB on Macs is to hold down the option key as soon as you power on the device. Select EFI Boot from this menu.\nUbuntu should now boot up from the USB. Install Ubuntu using the Erase and use Entire Disk option.\nFirstly, when you reboot/power on your Mac, you will see the grey screen of the Mac bootloader for about 30s, and then a gently flashing folder with a ? inside. If you insert the installer USB now, it should boot. If not, try holding the power button to force the power off, and then follow the USB booting instructions to bring it up.\nIf you’re using the desktop installer, hold the shift key to bring up the GRUB bootloader menu.\nDon’t select any of the entries. Instead, press C to bring up the GRUB console. \nAt the grub console, type ls\n\ngrub> ls \n(memdisk) (hd0) (hd0,msdos) (hd1) (hd2) (hd2,gpt3) (hd2,gpt2)\n  (hd2,gpt1)\n\nYou may not get exactly the same results as this, but you’ll have some similar options. \nNow, find the partition which contains your user's home directory.\n\ngrub> ls (hd2,gpt2)/home\nrohith/\n\nKeep trying until you find it.\nThe result from the last step has two parts: (hdX,gptY). You need to keep the hdX part, but go through all the gptY options looking for a /boot/grub directory.\n\ngrub> ls (hd2,gpt2)/boot/grub\nunicode.pf2 [...] grub.cfg\n\nNow you want to set this as your root for further commands.\n\ngrub> set root=(hd2,gpt2)\n\nThe only way to boot properly was to use the UUID of the drive. To get it -\n\ngrub> ls -l (hd2,gpt2)\n\nNote down the UUID. You'll have to type it manually in the next step.\n\ngrub> linux /boot/vmlinuz〈...tab here!...〉.efi.signed root=UUID=〈the\n  UUID from above〉\n\nThe GRUB console can do tab completion, so if you just type out the vmlinuz part and hit tab, then hit . and tab again, you won't have to type the whole file name. make sure that the efi.signed part is present.\nNow, set the initial RAM disk\n\ngrub> initrd /boot/initrd〈...tab here!...〉\n\nYou should be able to boot with the command\n\ngrub> boot\n\nThe system was initially unbootable because the Mac bootloader expects the EFI partition to be formatted as HFS+, the typical Mac filesystem, while the Ubuntu installer actually formats it as VFAT.\nNow, open a terminal and type\nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:detly/mactel-utils \nsudo apt-get update \nsudo apt-get install mactel-boot hfsprogs gdisk grub-efi-amd64\nRun mount to get a list of mounted filesystems, and look for anything mounted at /boot/efi. Unmount it.\nsudo umount /dev/sda1\nWe now use gdisk to delete the VFAT partition and create an HFS+ one,\nsudo gdisk /dev/sda\nPress p\nConfirm that the first partition has type EF00. Now we delete that EF00 partition.\nPress d\nCreate a new HFS+ one in its place.\nPress n\nPress enter key for the first and last sector options.\nEnter AF00 for the filesystem code.\nUse the p command to double-check your changes, and then w to write.\nNow we have an unformatted HFS+ partition. We can format it with - \nsudo mkfs.hfsplus /dev/sda1 -v ubuntu\nEdit /etc/fstab\nsudoedit /etc/fstab\nDelete the lines that refer to /boot/efi using Ctrl+K.\nNow, type the following commands - \nsudo bash -c 'echo $(blkid -o export -s UUID /dev/sda1) /boot/efi auto defaults 0 0 >> /etc/fstab'\nsudo bash -c 'echo \"This file is required for booting\" > /boot/efi/mach_kernel'\nInstall GRUB and 'bless' the filesystem.\nsudo grub-install --target x86_64-efi --boot-directory=/boot --efi-directory=/boot/efi\nsudo hfs-bless \"/boot/efi/System/Library/CoreServices/boot.efi\"\nTo set the default efi boot entry, run\nsudo efibootmgr\nGet rid of the extra entries - \nsudo efibootmgr -b xxxx -B\nwhere xxxx is the boot number obtained from sudo efibootmgr\nNow, set the default entry -\nsudo efibootmgr -o xxxx\nLastly, install the linux-signed-generic meta package - \nsudo apt-get install linux-signed-generic\nThis will make sure that any kernel updates also include the cryptographically signed kernel image required by EFI. Without this, your machine may freeze during boot. If that happens, refer to the instructions above for manually booting via grub.\nThe system should now be bootable!\n(Adapted with modifications from Jason Heeris' post)\n\nA: I would recommend not using LVM unless you really need it and you know what you are doing - I don't think it is the default option from memory. If you try installing from boot and choose to format and use the entire drive (don't use LVM), then remove the USB for the reboot, do you still get the same error icon (which is the Mac telling you it can't find a system folder to boot from)?\n\nA: Try holding down the 'option' key while booting, it might allow you to select which partition to boot. Ubuntu might show up as 'Windows'.\nIf that doesn't work, you can try installing rEFInd, a boot manager that will allow you to boot Ubuntu. There's a full guide for installing Ubuntu 14.04 as a single OS with rEFInd on a Macbook Pro here: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/MacPro\nBut in order to install rEFInd from your live Ubuntu system, download rEFInd from http://www.rodsbooks.com/refind/getting.html (pick the binary zip file) and extract it.\nThen open up a terminal (ctrl+alt+t) and navigate to the folder you extracted it to, with the cd command. If extracted to the default location, this should becd Downloads/refind-bin-0.8.1\nThen run sudo ./install.sh --esp\nThat should initiate the installation of rEFInd. If the installation succeeds, it will display a message in the terminal telling you so.\n", "Q: puppet rspec no such file to load -- rspec-puppet (LoadError) I have no prior experience at all of ruby.

I am running mongodb as a service on ubuntu server. How can I specify the config file that mongoDB uses?\nIs there a file with the command that starts mongod that I can edit to add the --config flag?\n\nA: You say you are running MongoDB as a service, so I am going to assume that you followed the instructions here to install the service and that you are starting and stopping the service using Upstart: sudo service mongodb start and sudo service mongodb stop.\nIf this is the case, then the Upstart job that is controlling your service will be here:\n/etc/init/mongodb.conf\n\nLet's take a look at the contents (note: you will need root permissions to edit the file):\n# Ubuntu upstart file at /etc/init/mongodb.conf\n\nlimit nofile 20000 20000\n\nkill timeout 300 # wait 300s between SIGTERM and SIGKILL.\n\npre-start script\n    mkdir -p /var/lib/mongodb/\n    mkdir -p /var/log/mongodb/\nend script\n\nstart on runlevel [2345]\nstop on runlevel [06]\n\nscript\n  ENABLE_MONGODB=\"yes\"\n  if [ -f /etc/default/mongodb ]; then . /etc/default/mongodb; fi\n  if [ \"x$ENABLE_MONGODB\" = \"xyes\" ]; then exec start-stop-daemon --start --quiet --chuid mongodb --exec  /usr/bin/mongod -- --config /etc/mongodb.conf; fi\nend script\n\nThe piece that pertains to your question is the second line from the bottom.  That is the one that specifies the config file to use.  Here is just the relevant snippet:\n/usr/bin/mongod -- --config /etc/mongodb.conf\n\nAs you can see, the config file is already being specified, so all you need to do to make config changes to your MongoDB service is edit that file at /etc/mongodb.conf.\nAfter changing your config, you will need to restart the service: sudo service mongodb restart.\n", "Q: Download 12.04 onto bootable usb I follow the instructions, \"How to create a bootable USB stick on Windows\".

Now my issue is that when I try to run ./AdobeAIRInstaller.bin, it tells me that it can't find libgtk-x11-2.0.so.0 because of 13.10's folder structure (libraries aren't simply in /usr/lib anymore, they're sub-foldered by build).

How do I avoid it in the future? So,  bit of background first.\nI have an Asus laptop with two partitions on the same disk, C: (OS) and D: (Data). I'd set all of my Windows default folders (documents, downloads, &c) to live on D: because it's much bigger.\nThen I decide that I'm going to slowly move toward Linux while keeping Windows for the utility stuff I still need for work (like Civ5). I install Ubuntu on D:\\ubuntu - bearing in mind there's still a lot of other D:* stuff, since I want to be able to access documents that I've stored there both in Windows and Ubuntu.\nThat install worked fine at first...I got everything installed that I needed to in order to be able to be using Ubuntu about 90% of the time I was using my machine. That lasted about five days. At one point, while I was using Windows, I got a notice that there were updates that needed installing; I let them install while I was shutting out of Windows.\nWhen I restarted, I knew I should boot Windows first because it had to finish configuring updates. I got a notice that there may be some disk corruption on D:, and the menu wouldn't really let me go farther without running sandisk. That ran, I booted into Windows, let the updates finish, shut down again, tried to boot Ubuntu and got error messages which eventually led me to things like this: How do I remove the extra Ubuntu option on the Windows Boot Manager menu?\nWhen I eventually booted Windows, I found everything (including the previously-mentioned Windows default folders) gone from D:. 100% free disk space, no backup, apart from the fact that most important files there were already Dropbox'd.\nNow, I want to reinstall Ubuntu, and if possible, to have Windows go back to the practice of storing data on D: so I can access it while using either OS, but for safety's sake, I moved all those default folders back over to their normal locations on C:. I'm willing to give that up if that's what caused the problem (if anything, it might accelerate my departure from Windows), but most importantly, I don't want to go and do all of this just to have Windows wipe the slate clean again.\nAny ideas?\n\nA: Relevant part:\n\nCorrupted NTFS filesystem\nAll reported cases of damaged filesystems were from users who hard rebooted (pulling the plug).\nWhen you hard reboot, there is always a chance of damaging your filesystem, whether you use Wubi or not.\nNew users, unfamiliar with a new operating system, tend to hard reboot more often than necessary when they encounter problems.\nIf Wubi becomes damaged as a result of a hard reboot, there is a chance that Windows may also become corrupted since the principle behind Wubi is that of a virtual disk within the host operating system.\nSometimes people blame Wubi for these issues even though a quick Google search will reveal numerous cases of NTFS corruption without users having ever installed Wubi or ntfs-3g (and a full software industry lurking on that…).\nIf the NTFS filesystem becomes corrupted you need to run chkdsk /r from the Windows Recovery Console on the Windows CD (or other recovery CD available on the web) or in the msdos console (if you can boot into Windows).\nAt the moment there is no fsck for NTFS on the Linux side, otherwise it would be possible to fix these errors automatically within Linux itself, without having to rely on Windows tools.\nThe best advice is to simply avoid hard rebooting, whatever OS you may be using.\n\nThis means that even if you didn't used WUBI, your disk might fail if you perform the same action you did.\n", "Q: If I Install Windows and Ubuntu in the same disc,Which one is better to instal first?

I followed it and managed to get it up and running with the Gnome desktop, although it wouldn't run Unity.\n", "Q: What makes specific services (apache2, mysql) autostart? Where can I set services apache2 and mysql to do not start automatically? Or start when asked for it instead?\nEDIT\nBootUp-Manager worked for me very well disabling autostart of both services.\n\nA: Ubuntu uses both sysvinit as well as upstart for runlevel.\nWhat you can do for apache2 as I think apache2 doesnot have upstart configuration is:\nupdate-rc.d -f apache2 remove\nand for mysql. You need to edit /etc/init/mysql.conf\nSearch for line start on and comment it with #\n#start on runlevel [2345]\nBasically scripts and configuration which are started are located on \n/etc/init.d/\n/etc/init/\n/etc/init/ is for upstart configuration\nAlso you can use BootUp-Manager [Graphical Application] to disable services of /etc/init.d/ but I donot think it works for /etc/init/\nJust do:\nsudo apt-get install bum\n", "Q: Adding repository error I'm trying to add a repository on my VPS with Ubuntu 12.04 installed using this command :\nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:chris-lea/node.js\n\nBut terminal is showing \n\ncommand not found\n\nThen I've entered the following command to solve the problem\nsudo apt-get install software-proprieties-common\n\nBut unfortunately I'm getting the following error :\nE: Unable to locate package software-proprieties-common\n\nHow can I solve this problems?\nUpdate\nNow software-properties-common installed, but same problem continues.

Can anyone help me?\np/s: Sorry I am quite newbie in Ubuntu. But familiar with Ubuntu Desktop.\nRegards,\n-Ismi\n\nA: for anyone else that gets here - the 'bad archive mirror' error can be a problem from a nameserver not working!\nIf you get here, make sure you verify that the nameserver you set (if you're not using DHCP) works - you should be able to go to virtualconsole 2-3 and use ping to verify you can ping things first... then see that you can ping the dns server you're trying to use.\nChanging the DNS server I was trying to use fixed this problem for me, after attempting to use a few different ubuntu versions since the errors in syslog were saying 'mirror does not have any suitable symlinks' or other errors that made it look like it just wasn't the right mirror.\n", "Q: Not able to copy any folder from samba share network I am connected to a windows network and i am coping a directory from my windows share, it starts coping but the progress bar stops in the middle without any error message and it does not copy.\nBut i am able to copy single files through same folder without any pause..but when i select more than two files and try to paste them in my desktop they got stop in the middle.\nAny solutions??\n\nA: Can you specify the total size of the data after which the copying stops?\nAlso you can use the following:\nmount -t smbfs -o lfs //server/share /localdir\n\nlfs tag allows transfer of large files\n", "Q: Creating an install drive - can not open output file autorun.inf I am trying to make an install/boot drive for a computer that has no operating system and no optical drive.

After it has finished, I remove the drive and insert to the other computer and turn it on, but it never finds a drive to boot from.\nWhat is causing this problem and how can I fix it ?\n\nA: Run the PenDriveLinux USB Installer tool as adminstrator. \nIn Windows right-click on Universal USB Installer and select \"Run as administrator\".\n\nA: In my experience, it may be your antivirus program preventing the installer for opening the file.

This allows you to install things such as extra link libraries. I have never used NotaBene and there appears to be no info on which (if any) tricks it needs, just that it should work in WINE. I would suggest installing winetricks:\nsudo apt-get install winetricks\n\nthen running the following to install some common libraries:\nwinetricks msxml3 msxml4 wsh56 msscript comctl32 jscript\n\nat some point the installer may stop and ask you to download some files it normally opens the website and the folder to download it to. After this you may need to re-run the command to do the install (I can't remember if it pauses or stops, the terminal is quite informative if you read the output).\n", "Q: wifi keeps on and off all all the time I have a Acer travilmate.

In Spotify, the songs are actually playing at around 3x speed. I have Googled this quite a bit and all I can come up with is a bug report from January 2012 which is marked as closed.\nI have tested Spotify and Hearthstone using PlayOnLinux with Wine versions 1.5.0, 1.6, 1.6.0, 1.7.0, 1.7.8 as well as the system Wine which is version 1.4.1. They all have the exact same terrible crackling sound issue. This leads me to assume that this is not a bug with Wine.\nThe steps to reproduce from the bug report:\nSteps to Reproduce:\n1. winecfg\n2. go to Audio tab\n3.

Sacrifice some quality for speed and see if that solves your underrun.\n\nA: With certain games if you use PlayOnLinux you can open the launcher with your text editor and change the Exec= line as follows:\nExec=env PULSE_LATENCY_MSEC=60 /usr/share/playonlinux/playonlinux --run \"GameName\" %F\n\n\nA: Since this is the first result returned by Google, I'd thought I share my experience here.\nFor those who look for a quick fix, put the following in your ~/.bashrc or /etc/profile for system-wide change:\nalias wine='PULSE_LATENCY_MSEC=60 wine'\n\nThis is the same fix that's used for Skype and PulseAudio 4.0 and above, which is behaving the same way as wine. Hope this helps!\nEdit (12.01.2016):\nYou can enable this variable globally by adding this line to ~/.bashrc and logging out/rebooting\nexport PULSE_LATENCY_MSEC=60\n\nIf you're experiencing audio issues in other applications after this, simply delete the line and logout or reboot. If you want to test it temporarily, open a new terminal and paste that line. Now every application that you invoke from this terminal will have the variable set and PulseAudio will set the latency.\nMore information on this problem and the 'fix': http://arunraghavan.net/2013/08/pulseaudio-4-0-and-skype/\n\nA: Try this solution.

So I hooked the hard drive into another computer of mine and installed the OS, then when I booted the server up it could not ping any web address or DNS from the internet. I narrowed the problem down to the fact that the Ethernet port has not been configured. to back this up I ran:\nifconfig -a | grep eth\n\nand the result was:\neth1     Link encap:Ethernet   HWaddr 00:08:74:c3:2f:df\n\nnext I ran:\nifdown eth1 && ifup eth1\n\nand the result was two lines. the first line result was:\nifdown: interface eth1 not configured\n\nand the second line read:\nIgnoring unknown interface eth1=eth1\n\nI just need to get this connected to the internet, but it is not enabling the Ethernet port, are there any commands that will enable me to manually activate the Ethernet so I can get internet connection?\nThe machine is a Dell Dimension 2350.\n\nA: I assume, since you are running Ubuntu Server, that you are running without a graphical environment. First, verify that your ethernet inteface is actually eth1:\nifconfig\n\nConfigure the interface temporarily:\nsudo nano /etc/network/interfaces\n\nAdd the following lines at the bottom of the existing file:\nauto eth1\niface eth1 inet dhcp\n\nSave and close nano. Now try to get an IP address:\nsudo ifup -v eth1\n\nDid you connect? Confirm:\nifconfig\n\nFor a server, so that you can ssh and ftp to the machine, I suggest you use a static IP address. Check in the administration pages of your router or access point to find the range of addresses used for DHCP; select an address for your static server outside that range. Now that we know that the Dell connects, let's reconfigure for a static IP:\nsudo nano /etc/network/interfaces\n\nChange the eth1 lines to:\nauto eth1\niface eth1 inet static\naddress 192.168.1.125\nnetmask 255.255.255.0\ngateway 192.168.1.1\ndns-nameservers 8.8.8.8 192.168.1.1 \n\nSave and close nano.

However, I'd like to know if there is a way where I can have Win 8 boot whilst leaving SecureBoot switched on for the added security benefits? I'd also like to understand better what exactly is going on here, how can it be SecureBoot causes issues for Win 8 loading here, but Ubuntu is fine..\n\nA: Unfortunately, some versions of GRUB have problems launching the Windows boot loader with Secure Boot active. I don't know offhand if this is true of the version of GRUB installed with Ubuntu 12.04.3, but your experience suggests it is. There are at least four ways around the problem:\n\n\n*\n\n*Disable Secure Boot. (I know you said you prefer to keep it active, and I respect that; but it is an option, and it's likely to be the easiest one to use.)\n\n*Locate a version of GRUB 2 that can launch the Windows boot loader with Secure Boot active. Unfortunately, I don't know precisely which versions will work for this. You'll also probably have to adjust the Linux Secure Boot configuration to get this to work.\n\n*Install my rEFInd boot manager to serve as your primary boot selector. Actually installing rEFInd is fairly easy; simply installing the Debian package will do the trick. You'll probably have to jump through some extra hoops to get it to work with Secure Boot, though.\n\n*Use the firmware's built-in boot manager. With most computers, hitting Esc or a function key early in the boot process brings up its own built-in boot manager. This should enable you to boot either Windows or GRUB/Linux, without using GRUB to boot Windows. Unfortunately, which key you press varies from one machine to another, the windows for getting the boot manager is usually short, and you'll always need to use that key to boot your non-default OS.\n\n\nThe extra Secure Boot hoops required for using rEFInd or a non-Ubuntu version of GRUB aren't really all that difficult to navigate once you understand the principles and tools involved. The pages to which I linked are long in part because they describe several different options. In brief, you may need to install a non-Ubuntu version of shim and, when it boots for the first time, use the associated MokManager program to install the Ubuntu key file (which is included in the rEFInd binary package and in an obscure Ubuntu package whose name and URL I don't recall).\n", "Q: doesn't booting after installed updates in ubuntu 12.04 LTS ubuntu 12.04 LTS doesn't booting after installing the updates .\nRecently i have installed ubuntu in my system also i installed latest updates. after installing the updates it doesn't booting and showing the error message as \"could not write bytes: broken pipe\" . what should i do to get into desktop ...\n\nA: Reinstall the iso, but deny any updates. thats what i always do. the iso is a frozen image where most software on the disc works. if one program does not function right look for its upgrade only in repo or on line. try to download its .deb or .rpm or other dot file extension for your distro brand. good luck.

I have created three separate files in /etc/apache2/sites-available and enabled them via a2ensite there is also the default site in /var/www  as well.  \nNow my concern is that each one of these sites is running about 10,000 cron jobs per day.  How do make sure the logs of each of these do not grow to big and eat all the memory?\nHow would I configure the log rotate and how often would one need to perform this task with 1gb of ram?\n\nA: Apache has its own rotatelog script. From the manual:\nThe command and options for rotatelog are:\nrotatelogs [ -l ] [ -f ] logfile rotationtime|filesizeM [ offset ] \n\nwhere the options are ...\n\n-l: Causes the use of local time rather than GMT as the base for the interval or for strftime(3) formatting with size-based rotation. Note that using -l in an environment which changes the GMT offset (such as for BST or DST) can lead to unpredictable results!\n-f:  Causes the logfile to be opened immediately, as soon as rotatelogs starts, instead of waiting for the first logfile entry to be read (for non-busy sites, there may be a substantial delay between when the server is started and when the first request is handled, meaning that the associated logfile does not \"exist\" until then, which causes problems from some automated logging tools). Available in version 2.2.9 and later.\nlogfile:  The path plus basename of the logfile. If logfile includes any '%' characters, it is treated as a format string for strftime(3). Otherwise, the suffix .nnnnnnnnnn is automatically added and is the time in seconds. Both formats compute the start time from the beginning of the current period. For example, if a rotation time of 86400 is specified, the hour, minute, and second fields created from the strftime(3) format will all be zero, referring to the beginning of the current 24-hour period (midnight). When using strftime(3) filename formatting, be sure the log file format has enough granularity to produce a different file name each time the logs are rotated. Otherwise rotation will overwrite the same file instead of starting a new one. For example, if logfile was /var/logs/errorlog.%Y-%m-%d with log rotation at 5 megabytes, but 5 megabytes was reached twice in the same day, the same log file name would be produced and log rotation would keep writing to the same file.\nrotationtime: The time between log file rotations in seconds. The rotation occurs at the beginning of this interval. For example, if the rotation time is 3600, the log file will be rotated at the beginning of every hour; if the rotation time is 86400, the log file will be rotated every night at midnight. (If no data is logged during an interval, no file will be created.)\nfilesizeM:     The maximum file size in megabytes followed by the letter M to specify size rather than time.\noffset    The number of minutes offset from UTC. If omitted, zero is assumed and UTC is used. For example, to use local time in the zone UTC -5 hours, specify a value of -300 for this argument. In most cases, -l should be used instead of specifying an offset.\n\nExamples:\nCustomLog \"|bin/rotatelogs /var/logs/logfile 86400\" common\n\nThis creates the files /var/logs/logfile.nnnn where nnnn is the system time at which the log nominally starts (this time will always be a multiple of the rotation time, so you can synchronize cron scripts with it). At the end of each rotation time (here after 24 hours) a new log is started.\nCustomLog \"|bin/rotatelogs -l /var/logs/logfile.%Y.%m.%d 86400\" common\n\nThis creates the files /var/logs/logfile.yyyy.mm.dd where yyyy is the year, mm is the month, and dd is the day of the month. Logging will switch to a new file every day at midnight, local time.\nCustomLog \"|bin/rotatelogs /var/logs/logfile 5M\" common\n\nThis configuration will rotate the logfile whenever it reaches a size of 5 megabytes.\nErrorLog \"|bin/rotatelogs /var/logs/errorlog.%Y-%m-%d-%H_%M_%S 5M\"\n\nThis configuration will rotate the error logfile whenever it reaches a size of 5 megabytes, and the suffix to the logfile name will be created of the form errorlog.YYYY-mm-dd-HH_MM_SS.\nCustomLog \"|bin/rotatelogs -t /var/logs/logfile 86400\" common\n\nThis creates the file /var/logs/logfile, truncating the file at startup and then truncating the file once per day. It is expected in this scenario that a separate process (such as tail) would process the file in real time.\nYou can put these commands in the conf file.\n", "Q: Can't boot into Ubuntu after Windows 8.1 upgrade, boot-repair doesn't fix it I have a sony vaio duo 11 convertible, it was successfully dual booting lubuntu 13.10 and windows 8, but after the upgrade to windows 8.1 it doesn't load anything but windows.\nI disabled windows' \"quick boot\" feature, then run boot-repair, but it doens't fix the issue (it used to work when windows 8 messed the boot config, but not with windows 8.1).

Windows kept overwriting the boot loader until I removed its \"quick boot\" option.\n(everything was working again)\n\n*Upgraded windows to 8.1, now there is a windows boot loader, I removed (again) the \"quick boot\" option, I repeatedly installed grub on /dev/sda but I always get another bootloader (windows/microsoft/easyBCD??) that is only able to run windows.\n\n\nI would like to understand which boot loader is run at startup, where it is located, and how I can change that. Thank you!\nedit:\nI installed rEFInd in windows following the official instructions, and effectively changing the \"windows boot manager\" section so that now it looks as follows:\nS:\\EFI\\refind>bcdedit /enum active /v\nWindows Boot Manager\n--------------------\nidentificatore          {9dea862c-5cdd-4e70-acc1-f32b344d4795}\ndevice                  partition=S:\npath                    \\EFI\\refind\\refind_x64.efi\ndescription             rEFInd am\nlocale                  it-IT\ninherit                 {7ea2e1ac-2e61-4728-aaa3-896d9d0a9f0e}\ndefault                 {b781b519-6749-11e3-a4a1-eb3a69ac7fb1}\nresumeobject            {b781b518-6749-11e3-a4a1-eb3a69ac7fb1}\ndisplayorder            {b781b519-6749-11e3-a4a1-eb3a69ac7fb1}\n                        {b781b512-6749-11e3-a4a1-eb3a69ac7fb1}\n                        {b781b524-6749-11e3-a4a1-eb3a69ac7fb1}\ntoolsdisplayorder       {b2721d73-1db4-4c62-bf78-c548a880142d}\ntimeout                 5\ndisplaybootmenu         Yes\n\nBUT I still get a boot loader that is not rEFInd!! it looks similar to this instead: \nwindows legacy boot loader\n\nA: TRY THIS FIRST\nIn Win 8.1 hold down SHIFT while you click on Restart.  It should bring Advanced Startup Options.  You should be able to select your Ubuntu startup partition from there and then boot into it.\nSaves the trouble of re-installing, but you have to ask Windows to load Ubuntu... \n\nA: Your Boot Repair output shows that there's no BIOS/CSM/legacy boot loader installed, so it's unlikely that the screen you're seeing is for that. It's more likely to be the Windows EFI-mode boot manager.\nYou've taken all the right steps, so it's puzzling why it's not working. Your symptoms, though, are mostly consistent with a computer on which Secure Boot is enabled, so to start with, I recommend you check your firmware's Secure Boot settings. Maybe it got turned back on after you disabled it, or maybe there's something odd about the setting that you overlooked. (OTOH, the fact that you can boot with a rEFInd USB flash drive argues against this possibility. Still, it's worth checking....)\nIf that doesn't work, you might consider a rather radical approach (but do this only if you can currently boot Linux via a rEFInd USB flash drive):\n\n\n*\n\n*Launch Boot Repair and use the Advanced menu to select the option to restore backups. Your Boot Repair output indicates that these options have been applied, but they may be causing some confusion, so it's best to undo these changes.\n\n*Back up the ESP. (Simply copying the /boot/efi directory tree to a spare USB flash drive or some convenient directory in Linux should do the trick -- but a USB flash drive will be accessible under Windows, should that become necessary.)\n\n*Delete all the files on the ESP.\n\n*Using efibootmgr or your firmware's tools, erase all the firmware's boot manager entries from NVRAM. You'd do this by typing sudo efibootmgr -v to see what the entries are, then using the -B option and -b #### to delete each entry in turn, as in sudo efibootmgr -B -b 0001 to delete Boot0001. You'll need to repeat the -B/-b command for each entry.\n\n*Re-install rEFInd in Linux. (Alternatively, you could re-install GRUB 2 with grub-install.)\n\n*If rEFInd boots from the hard disk, and enables you to boot Linux, try restoring the EFI/Microsoft subdirectory.\n\n\nThe idea here is to clean all the crud out of the ESP and the NVRAM, thus enabling you to start with a clean slate.\n\nA: I solved the issue this way:\n\n\n*\n\n*Start lubuntu from refind usb boot disk.\n\n*Delete everything in /boot/efi\n\n*mkdir /boot/efi/EFI (otherwise boot-repair doesn't realize that there's an EFI partition)\n\n*boot-repair selecting the option \"separate /boot/efi\" partition.\n\n\nAt this point grub works and boots lubuntu (and android-x86).\nTo get windows back, I had to restore the folder /boot/efi/Microsoft, then rename it to Microsoft2 and add this to /etc/grub.d/40_custom :\nmenuentry \"Windows Boot Manager (UEFI on /dev/sda1)\" --class windows --class os {\n    insmod part_gpt\n    insmod fat\n    set root='hd0,gpt1'\n    chainloader /EFI/Microsoft2/Boot/bootmgfw.efi\n}\n\nI had to rename the folder because strangely if there is a folder named \"Microsoft\", the windows boot loader is shown instead of grub (and I would really like to know why).\n\nA:  RUNNING LUBUNTU & UBUNTU ON A FACTORY INSTALLED WINDOWS 8.1 MACHINE \nSorry about the length of this answer but it's what worked for me. \nI'm also working on finding a way to add the Ubuntu boot file the EFI drive boot folder. I'll post here if I get it to work.\n\n\n\n*\n\n*Ok so after about 9 hours of trying to install Lubuntu on my laptop that has Windows 8.1 I have figured everything out except how to have an automatic option between OS's when booting. So, here's what I have learned:\n\n\n*\n\n*The steps I'm sure most already know but I'll go through them anyways:\n\n\n\nPart #1 ~ Download Software & Install on USB Drive\n\n\n*\n\n*Download the Ubuntu (for desktop PC) or Lubuntu (for laptop PC) .iso file.\n\n\n*\n\n*Next you need to create a liveCD or liveUSB of the .iso. so we can boot from that when done.\n\n*Download Unetbootin selecting the run feature. Once the install is complete start the program. I shouldn't have to say this but we all have these moments so: Make sure your USB is in your computer LOL. Next check that your USB has enough room for what you're doing. Everything I've read says to use an 8GB USB (for Lubuntu) so that's what I did and it took up 0.6GB and I have a hard time believing it needs 7GB to run. However, if your installing Ubuntu, I'd say you probably want to use an entire 8GB USB just to be safe.\n\n\n*\n\n*Once it's running change how it's getting the iso by clicking the bubble next to the DiskImage\n\n*Next click the link with 3(three) dots on it and find your file on you computer wherever you saved it. \n\n*Lastly check that it has selected the correct USB (If you have more than 1(one) connected) and click OK to begin installing it on your USB\n\n\n\n\nPart #2 ~ Partition Hard Drive for Ubuntu Installation\n\n\n*\n\n*Now you need to partition your HDD, if you don't have a partition software MiniTool is a good freeware you can use, and it's what I'm going to describe here and use pics of. So if you need to download that now. The size of your partition drive doesn't need to be big (I used 13GB, 10GB for the operating drive and 3GB for the swap drive). As before with the USB if you're planning to install Ubuntu you'll probably want to allocate more space for the root HDD you choose. \n\n\n*\n\n*After installing MiniTool the first screen asks for permission, click yes, the next screen has 02 choices: MiniTool Partition Wizard and MiniTool Power Data Recovery. Naturally you'll select the partition wizard. Now don't be intimidated when the home screen appears, it's not as difficult as it looks. \n\n*Now you'll create the room for your partition. If you have unallocated space on your HDD (Yeah. Right. Who has that?) then skip ahead to Step 4. If you don't have any unallocated space, the best thing to do is choose your main HDD location (C:\\ unless your computer was custom built and you requested otherwise) and use a portion of that for your new partition. If you're reading this part I'm going to assume you're new to the world of partitioning so you don't have a partitioned drive with a separate storage partition and operating system partition. If you have 2 HDD's just choose the one with more free space. Also you'll more than likely notice your HDD already has other partitions that aren't mounted (don't show in Windows) and one that is. It's just the manufacturers way of making sure people don't delete important stuff, so try not to format or alter these drives in any way.\n\n*After choosing the correct location to create your new partition from (make sure it is the one highlighted in the brownish color), at the top of the window there are different options. You want to select Move/Re-size. When the new window appears the first thing you'll probably notice is the bar that represents the drives current size. What you want to do is click & hold the right side of that bar and drag left freeing as much space as you'd like. Say you have approximately 371GB free & a total size of 627GB and want Ubuntu to be free standing (not sharing any HDD space) so you want it to have a 150GB partition. You would drag the bar until it was as close to 477GB as possible (If you're OCD like me you can use the value size boxes under the bar until you get your desired sizes). The data info in the bar is in GB however the value boxes are in KB so remember that 1024KB = 1GB. Now click OK \n\n*Now you'll see a section of unallocated HDD space (If you skipped to this step we I have created an imaginary partition with 150GB of space). Now select the unallocated HDD space (gray) and click the option create partition. Use the slider to determine the size of this partition (I recommend creating your data drive first so you can merge it later with your C: drive if you need to). Assuming you're installing Lubuntu the recommendation is your SWAP drive be the same size as your computers RAM, I have 3GB so I'm going to use that. You'll want 10GB for your OS and the 3GB for your SWAP, therefore your first partition should be 137GB. Before or after adjusting your slider you can name the drive, I'll name mine Steve. \n\n*You also choose the format here, from the research I've done it seams Ext3 is the best. If you're new to Linux, you're probably no familiar with this format and that's because it's just for Linux. If  you think you'll want Windows to have access to this drive or might have to merge them later and don't want to have to format the drive and lose the info on it u can choose NTFS. \n\n*Now you pick the Drive Letter, use the drop down list and take your pick. This have no impact on the drive itself. Since mine is named Steve I'd make it the S: drive.\n\n*Leave the cluster option at default and click OK\n\n*This will take you back to the home screen with a remaining unallocated section of 13GB, repeat Steps 4-7 using a different name and Drive Letter, however you can't use NTFS here. Use the Ext3 that I talked about earlier. \n\n*Now that it's all setup for your l/ubuntu installation you want to click Apply in the top left corner.\n\n\n\nPart #3 ~ Changing Your Computers Setting\n\n\n*\n\n*After MiniTools has finished creating the partitions it's time to adjust your BIOS/UEFI settings. There's 2(two) ways of doing this.\n\n\n*\n\n*If you're familiar with Command Prompt or Power Shell open one. If not you can right click the start icon on your task bar and select Command Prompt and when it opens type (shutdown /r /o) without the parenthesis, if it doesn't, add an .exe extension after \"shutdown\". When done correctly your computer will reboot into the advanced settings menu. If you aren't comfortable with this I'll tell you the long way.\n\n*For the long route hold the Windows key and hit C to bring up the charms bar or move your mouse to the top right corner of the screen and open the settings sub-menu.  \n\n*Select Change PC Settings at the very bottom of the menu. In this settings menu go to the bottom sub-menu Update & Recovery, once in this menu again select the bottom sub-menu recovery and lastly click the restart option in the bottom category Advanced Startup\n\n*Your computer will now restart into the Advanced Start-up menu. You should have 3 options, select Troubleshooting and then select the UEFI Settings Menu again your computer should restart. This time into a menu set that looks just like an old BIOS settings menu. Here is where it can get a little tricky, each UEFI menu is different depending on what kind of motherboard you have. If you don't know what you're doing I wouldn't recommend changing anything besides what I talk about. Changing the wrong thing in this settings menu can ruin your computer beyond repair. If you have a computer or laptop from a major manufacturer (Dell, HP, Gateway, Etc.) they probably locked most of the settings anyways but a few (ASUS, Alien) don't and if it's a custom built computer it'll probably be fully adjustable. \n\n*Anyways go to the BOOT menu/sub-menu, you might have to use the arrows on your keyboard and it might be a sub-menu. The BOOT menu is actually a sub-menu of the System Configuration menu. Once in the BOOT sub-menu you should be able to adjust a few things no matter what kind of computer you have. One of which is the order your computer checks drivers to boot in. This means if the OS software is first on the list the USB won't work. You'll want to move the USB drive option to the top of the list. Here is where I found a way to boot with Lubuntu, if you ever used the old BIOS menu you know that you entered by hitting either the ESC, DEL, F2, or F9 keys, this isn't a standard option anymore however my HP Pavilion Sleekbook 15 has an option called POST Hotkey Delay to turn this feature on and pick how long you have to push the key.\n\n*If you have this feature it's not the same as the old BIOS, on my computer when this feature is on and I push the ESC key, instead of going directly into the BIOS menu I'm given an option list that includes a way to pick my boot device, go into the BIOS menu, and a few other options I can't remember. \n\n\n\nA: I had to turn OFF \"Fast Boot\" option in my BIOS and that worked. \nI left the fast boot option ON in the Windows 8.1 and also left the UEFI and Secure boot options on in the BIOS. My setup was Windows 8.1 Pro and Ubuntu 13.10. I also tried Debian 7.3 and it was giving me the same problem until I made the above changes to the BIOS.\n", "Q: How to copy my Ubuntu system (laptop) to another laptop ? I am looking to copy the whole Ubuntu system from one laptop to another laptop (with no operating system), how can I do it ? \nI found older threads How to back up my entire system? but they looks to be 2-3 years old so I thought we may be having a better solution now ? \n\nA: Normally simply copying an operating system from one place to another is not a good idea. A lot of configuration is done during the install. Instead what you are best to do in my opinion is copy your home directory across (including all the hidden files) this should give you most of your personal settings for programs. For any program which doesn't open with your settings when you install it on the new laptop you can normally find where that program saves its preferences with a google and copy them across with a USB stick. I really recommend this option!!\nIf you really want to give it a go. You can use clonezilla in live CD mode to create a copy of your system image onto an external drive. The boot on the new laptop in clonezilla live CD and copy the system partition on. I stress, however, I think this is a bad idea! I have done this before for moving a system from one HDD to another, but it was for use in the same system, I was just changing drive.\n\nA: You can use Clonezilla. It is pretty advanced program/distro that needs some linux/computer knowledge. Here's some guides that shows you how to use it:\nhttp://clonezilla.org/general-live-use.php\nhttp://www.wikihow.com/Use-Clonezilla\nhttp://drbl.org/faq/\nhttp://www.techrepublic.com/blog/windows-and-office/how-do-i-clone-a-hard-drive-with-clonezilla/\nThere's two ways you can accomplice your copy:\n\n*\n\n*Make an image of the HDD that you later restore to the new HDD\n\n*You can clone the two HDDs \"live\", in other words you need both HDDs connected to the computer at the same time, which is hard on a laptop.\n\nI assume that the new laptop uses the exact hardware as the first one. If not, I recommend you to reinstall Ubuntu at the new laptop and just copy all of your personal files. If you just copy the HDD to another new laptop with new hardware, drivers and other things will get broken, and it probably won't boot correctly.\n", "Q: How do i find out lines of a file that are not present in another file? I have two files A and B.\nI want to find out which lines of file B are not present in the file A. \nHow do I do this? The lines can be at any position in file A\n\nA: Simply\ngrep -vxf A B\n\nIf you want the line number of the non-matching lines also:\ngrep -nvxf A B\n\nIf B has multiple non-matching identical lines, and you only want to print out the identical lines once, then\ngrep -vxf A B | sort | uniq  \n\n\nA: you can sdiff command. \n Usage: sdiff file1.txt file2.txt\nyou can have the lines any where.\nWhat are the uncommon lines are there they will be indicated with > symbol. Look at the below image.\nExample:\n\n\nA: You say lines can be at any position, but if position is not important to you (just want to know the differences), use comm:\n\n   Compare sorted files FILE1 and FILE2 line by line.\n\n   With  no  options,  produce  three-column  output.  Column one contains\n   lines unique to FILE1, column two contains lines unique to  FILE2,  and\n   column three contains lines common to both files.\n\n\nIt requires files to be sorted, luckily sort can help with that. You can sort A > A.sorted to sort it, do something similar with B, and then:\ncomm -1 -3 A.sorted B.sorted\n\nthis will print \"lines unique to FILE2\" which in this case is B.sorted.\nYou can also do the sort inline, the command is a bit more cumbersome to type but you'd save a few steps:\ncomm -1 -3 <(sort A) <(sort B)\n\n", "Q: Black screen while installing Ubuntu 12.04.3 on Dell Precision M4800 I'm trying to install Ubuntu 12.04.3 LTS on my new Dell Precision M4800 (from a USB key, made from Ubuntu) and I've got that problem : after choosing my language on the boot screen, I can see no more things on my screen, it keeps black...\nThe graphic card is an NVidia Quadro K2100M...\nI tried to boot with an Ubuntu 12.04.1 install USB key, and I had something on the screen but my ethernet card wasn't detected (the wifi was OK)...\n\nA: I finally have been able to correctly boot my USB key with option \"nomodeset\" at boot time and managed to install Ubuntu 12.04.3\n\nA: It also works with 12.10 and \"nomodeset\"\nFrom there  it is possible to update to trusty.\nI didn't manage to install 13.04 directly since after \ninstalling and rebooting the system got lost in upstart madness.\nHowever: In 12.10 and current 13.04 with nvidia-331, whenever the \nscreen blanks, it is not possible to get the system to un-blank it again.\nIf you install sshd and log in from another machine the system \nproves to be working fine otherwise.\n\nA: Here is the procedure that I used, it works fine (enjoy the QHD+ screen !!!)\n(skip steps 1-5 if you do not have a SSD)\n1 (for SSDs) Use the Debian disk just to boot the system and obtain a shell (I do not remember the exact option)\n2 (for SSDs) I created a big partition in the whole disk, starting at block 4096 (default).\n3 (for SSDs) I could not find the information on erase block size for the LITEONIT SSD anywhere,so I'm using the default parameters ( hdparm -I /dev/sda reports model type, i.e. LITEONIT LCS-256M6S 2.5 7mm 256GB but I did not find erase block size information on the internet for this model)\n4 (for SSDs) Create the filesystem: mkfs.ext4 -b 4096 /dev/sda1\n5 (for SSDs) Restart installation, select manual partitioning, edit partition, set use as ext4 , mount point: / , additional flags: discard, noatime\nthese flags are useful for SSDs, discard uses block erase capabilities of SSDs, and noatime prevents the system for recording last access time in every files.\n6) First boot: edit booting options (using advanced mode from GRUB screen, select kernel, press e, remove load_video and add flags: nomodeset text, then press F10. nomodeset means that the console remains in text mode, and text means that the system will not attempt to start X11 graphics mode (it seems that the shipped drivers cannot drive the ultra HD screen)\n7) edit /etc/default/grub , find the line GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT=\"quiet\" and replace it with GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT=\"quiet nomodeset\"\n8) add blacklist nouveau in /etc/modprobe.d/blacklist.conf (create the file if it does not exist)\n9) update-grub\n10) rmmod nouveau\n11) aptitude install build-essential linux-headers-amd64 linux-headers-amd64-all\n12) Install NVIDIA driver (load it from NVIDIA's website)\n13) dpkg-reconfigure linux-image-3.13-1-amd64 (this re-creates the ramdisk that contains the device drivers, including the new NVidia driver, and re-initializes the grub boot loader).

I observed that none of the included nginx blends has the spdy module enabled and I don't want to manually compile it for that. \nI am looking for a apt repository solution but I wasn't able to find one yet.\n\nA: Ubuntu's nginx-full, nginx-core and nginx-extras packages comes with the compiler flag --with-http_spdy_module. Other builds, -light and -naxsi doesn't. The below still applies if you want to compile the version from upstream.\n\nOk, first of all:\n\nThe ngx_http_spdy_module module provides experimental support for SPDY. Currently, draft 3.1 of SPDY protocol is implemented.\nThis module is not built by default, it should be enabled with the --with-http_spdy_module configuration parameter.\n\nSo, as you can see, is difficult that somebody will provide nginx with some characteristics that will likely not work well (I didn't). In those cases you really only solution (which is easy nonetheless) compile from sources. In an nutshell you can create your own version of nginx using:\napt-get source nginx\ncd nginx*\neditor debian/rules\n\nHere you look for the line config.status.full: config.env.full and append along all the configure options --with-http_spdy_module. Save your file.\nsudo apt-get build-dep nginx\nsudo apt-get install dpkg-dev\ndpkg-buildpackage\n\nDone, your deb ready for installation is there. You can create a PPA that do this stuff for you too. As you can see you take more time looking for a repository than compiling it yourself.\n\nA: Recently, Ubuntu has started to build nginx with spdy by default. Since Ubuntu 12.04 is an LTS release, it doesn't include these recent changes. However, there is an Nginx  ppa that does includes releases of Nginx that have the spdy module enabled. You can add it by running:\nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:nginx/stable\n\n", "Q: Using old same-version ISO for new install. Any problems? I have downloaded the Ubuntu 13.10 iso several weeks ago, but hadn't got a time to install the OS, so should it be okay if I burn the ISO to my USB using that ISO, or I should redownload? Will there any new updates being rolled onto me, or they will be updated straight at install? Thanks.

I have a Ubuntu Server currently running 13.04. I want to upgrade to 13.10 but I get an error:\nNot enough free disk space \n\nThe upgrade has aborted. The upgrade needs a total of 61.0 M free \nspace on disk '/boot'. Please free at least an additional 21.5 M of \ndisk space on '/boot'. Empty your trash and remove temporary packages \nof former installations using 'sudo apt-get clean'.\n\nThe boot partition is:\nFilesystem      Size  Used Avail Use% Mounted on\n/dev/sda5        76M   35M   38M  48% /boot\n\nI have followed the various other questions to free more space. I ran the clean command above, and I have removed all old kernels so now I only have the latest kernel.\nLooking around, it seems that 200MB is a recommended size for /boot, but the only answers I've seen say to use gparted on the LiveCD.\nHowever, I only have SSH access to the server so this is not an option. Is there some way to repartition the hard drive over SSH?\n\nA: Sorry, but it is very likely you can't.\nResizing partitions cannot be done while the partition is in use. While your system might tolerate you unmounting /boot at runtime, in order to resize it, you need some free space directly after or before that partition, which in all likelyhood is taken up by your /, which you cannot unmount while the OS is running.\nThere's one chance this might work after all, but it depends on you having a swap partition adjacent to /boot. If that's the case, you can unmount /boot and disable swapping, then remove your swap partition, use that space to grow /boot and create a new, slightly smaller swap partition in the leftover space. Another question here on AskUbuntu has all the details on that.\n", "Q: ubuntu locale difference between zh_CN.utf8 and zh_CN.UTF-8 There are some questions about Linux locale confused me much.  \nWhat is the difference between zh_CN.utf8 and zh_CN.UTF-8 ?

I'm new to ubuntu, and I have some basic knowledge of how it works.\nI have a question about PPAs, and installing an application/program/script via PPA. When I add a PPA to the system, and install the software packages it contains in my Ubuntu, will Update Manager show updates for that software? I think it does but I want to make sure.\nThank you in advance.\n\nA: Update Manager will show it, but only when it next attempts to retrieve update information.\nTypically when you add a PPA to your sources, what happens is your computer treats that as any other repository.  If it has a higher version number than what's in the normal Ubuntu repositories, it'll supersede whatever's in the repositories and that'll be the \"updated\" version.\nIf the version in the Ubuntu repositories is newer than what's in the PPA, then you have to manually tell Ubuntu \"I don't want what's in the Ubuntu repositories, I want this specific version from this specific location.\" and then it will install that version from the PPA specifically.  (Typically, you either have to use Synaptic, or a long command entered into Terminal, to \"force\" lower version numbers to be installed)\nHowever, this is still dependent on automatic update checking through update-manager.  To force the update, you can open that and do \"Check for Updates\" which will effectively force apt and dpkg to pull new data from the repositories and the PPA, and update available software.\n\nDo also note, that if the PPA is stale (i.e. not updated by its owner/maintainer anymore) you won't see any updates from the PPA.  Updated packages in a PPA, as well, will only be available if the maintainer of the PPA uploads new packages.\n\nThe above also makes the assumption you added the PPA, then either used Synaptic, Software Center, or a command entered in the Terminal (command line, such as sudo apt-get install PACKAGENAME) to install the program in the PPA.  After its installed, apt and update-manager will correctly check for updates on that package from the PPA and the main repository sources.\nIf you didn't actually install the script and/or program that's in the PPA, then the system won't get updates for it.\n", "Q: Toshiba Laptop keyboard and mouse intermittently stop working Hey I've done quite a bit of googling and can't find the solution to my problem.\nI've also been away from Linux for over a year so if I need to provide my information I apologize.\nHowever I've installed Ubuntu 12.04 64bit and on my Toshiba L875D-S7332 laptop when it boots up sometimes the onboard touchpad and keyboard don't work.

I guess the current settings are either pm = static  with pm.max_children = 6 or pm = dynamic  with pm.start_servers = 6. One process would be the controlling process, the others would be children ready to handle requests. If you only have 5 not 6 children configured, then I must confess I don't know what that last process is used for. On large high-throughput sites, such a configuration with many ready-to-use children makes sense, but in a memory-constrained (probably virtual) environment where you only expects PHP scripts to execute every now and then, a different configuration might be more appropriate.\nTo achieve this, edit the pool config files and set pm = ondemand. Then children will be created only to handle requests. This will mean less memory consumption while no requests are active, although it might also mean more time required to create a child. The latter can be reduced by choosing a reasonable pm.process_idle_timeout, so that a sane number of php processes remain idle while users can be expected to use them again soon. That “sane number” is controlled by pm.max_children.\nNote: This advice is based on my experience with Debian 7, but it should apply to Ubuntu as well.\n\nA: Lots of people encourage to use pm=ondemand to save memory. However, it also means that your time to first byte (or server answer ) is going to be very big because if your web server had no recent visits, the php-fpm module will have to first create a child before answering a request. If you use pm=dynamic, it means you will always have at least 1 child ready to answer a client request. The following will load 1 child per user after restarting php-fpm\npm=dynamic\npm.start_servers=1\npm.min_spare_servers=1\n\n", "Q: Is there a usable GUI version of Photorec or Testdisk?

Well when I revisit and launch the game again the files, with the initial names, reappear in my directory. And the files that I renamed are still where I put them. Why would the website redownload those files onto my computer even though they still exists just with different names and in a different directory?\n\nA: \nWhy would the website redownload those files onto my computer even though they still exists just with different names and in a different directory?\n\nBecause it doesn't know. Usually programs look for files they expect in only a very limited number of places, and then assume the file is gone. There is no trace to point the application at the new location of a moved file.\nPerhaps the applicatin always downloads to the current directory. If so, then changing the current working directory to the directory where you moved those files might help. But it would be very helpful if you'd actually indicate what program you are running which does that downloading.\n", "Q: juju consolidation and constrains I'm trying out Ubuntu cloud infrastructure in a lab environment, I had couple attempts and fails mostly because my references are outdated. \"My main ref. now is https://help.ubuntu.com/community/UbuntuCloudInfrastructure\"\nMy lab consists of three powerful servers, 3 low PCs, and 4 notebooks.\nConstrains:\nDue to diversity in resources.

But I saw in another ticket here that I can do that by specifying constrains.\nIs there a reference/ticket/how to article for that?\nConsolidation:\nAs jitsu is obsolete, and juju deploy to still consumes whole nodes for low services, I think add-node is the best alternative, yet again I lack the proper documentation to try this.\nSo I guess I'm asking for some demo case studies or best practices guides from the experts.\n\nA: You can use any of the following constraints to pick the hardware required for particular machines or services. If you're using maas, you can set up tags on your nodes and then specify them with the tags constraint in juju; otherwise the cpu-cores, mem, and root-disk constraints may be enough for the situation you've described.\nNote that the relevant part of jitsu's functionality has been consumed by juju: if you used, say, juju add-machine --constraints tags=bigserver to create a new machine, and that machine got given id 3, you could then use --to 3 with juju deploy or juju add-unit to place service units on that particular instance.\n", "Q: How to disable/remove a desktop widget I added a widget \"bouncy ball\" to the desktop and accidentaly in its settings set auto-bounce to full.

I can't be sure exactly what situation caused the problem, but I have my suspicions that having nvidia-current and nvidia-current-updates may have caused it.  I certainly saw more than one nvidia driver installed when I did:\ndpkg -l nvidia*\n\nFully removing all drivers and then reinstalling fixed it.  To do that, enter these commands:\nsudo apt-get -y purge --auto-remove nvidia.*\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get -y install nvidia-current-updates nvidia-settings-updates\n\nHTH\n\nA: First, I suggest you boot an older kernel from the grub menu. \nAssuming the old kernel works, we can then debug your nvidia driver. But we need to know how you installed the nvidia driver (manually or from the software center?).\nTo configure nvidia, boot to recovery mode, start a root shell.\nRemount the / partition rw\nmount -o remount,rw /\n\nthen backup and re-run the nvidia configuration utility. It is a command line tool and I think it is called nvidia-xconfig, you can use tab completion\nAt the command line, type nvidia-TabTab and either the command will auto-complete or show a list of options.\ncd /etc/X11\nmv xorg.conf xorg.conf.backup\nnvidia-xconfig\n\nThen exit the root shell and continue a normal boot.\nMore likely then not, as the nvidia driver was working, reconfiguration is not going to help and you likely need to update your nvidia driver for the new kernel.\n\nA: After I removed the Nvidia drivers, I can get into X GUI. Although it is not a prefect solution, but it kind of works. Here are the commands to remove the drivers.\nsudo apt-get remove --purge nvidia-*\nsudo apt-get install ubuntu-desktop\nsudo rm /etc/X11/xorg.conf\necho 'nouveau' | sudo tee -a /etc/modules\n\n", "Q: add X-Robots-Tag to apache config I need to fix my server with the robots tags headers,\nX-Robots-Tag\n\nis there an easy way to add this in apache httpd.conf?\n\nA: This worked well for me:\n(insert into /etc/apache2/sites-available/<site name>.conf inside the \"VirtualHost\" tag)\nHeader Set X-Robots-Tag \"noindex, noarchive, nosnippet\"\n\nThe \"mod_headers\" Apache Module must be enabled also:\nsudo a2enmod headers\nsudo service apache2 restart\n\n\nA: You should use this:\n<ifModule mod_headers.c>\n    RequestHeader append X-Robots-Tag \"something here\"\n</ifModule>\n\nYou need to have enabled and activated the mod_headers\n", "Q: How can I leave tty? So I got a problem here. So I installed SDL 2.0.1, everything worked fine, I installed dependencies of sdl as well, so I saw that it didn't worked, so I rebooted my pc, after that I get to gnome, and don't know what do, maybe some help? :)\n\nA: Normally, can enter a tty with Ctrl+Alt+(F1-F12), and in Ubuntu, and can exit it with Ctrl+Alt+F7. This problem is probably due to the login manager not starting. Try:\nsudo service lightdm start\n\nfor the default lightdm login manager, and this for Gnome's login manager:\nsudo /etc/init.d/gdm start\n\nYou can also try entering the user session directly:\nstartx\n\nPleases note that some of the above may be guesswork... \n", "Q: Adding parameter to default browser I can run Browser from dash with added parameters (like google-chrome --single-process --purge-memory-button) without problem, by editing of .desktop file, but how I could reach the same by running of default browser via triggering open URL event? There is no options applied in this case.\nFor example if I have document in LibreOffice with URL, after click on it, new instance of browser appear, but no parameters are applied to. How I can change those?\n\nA: Editing the .desktop file is enough in this case also because the default applications are called through the .desktop file. \nSee the /etc/gnome/defaults.list file and the ~/.local/share/applications/mimeapps.list file, the first one contains the system defaults and the second one contains the defaults which you chose instead of the system default.\nSo basically just look into those files and see which .desktop file is called for which mime type and edit that .desktop file the way you like. The .desktop files can be found in the /usr/share/applications/ directory or if you have overriden a default .desktop that can be found in the ~/.local/share/applications/ directory. (That means if you have a .desktop file with the same name in both directories, the system will always use the .desktop file present in the ~/.local/share/applications/ directory)\nE.g. if I want firefox to open links what I click in a terminal in new window instead of in a new tab, I would just make sure that firefox is my default application for browsing, and then just\ncp /usr/share/applications/firefox.desktop ~/.local/share/applications/firefox.desktop\n\nto override the default .desktop file, and change the ~/.local/share/applications/firefox.desktop file at the line \nExec=firefox %u\n\nto \nExec=firefox -new-window %u\n\n\nA: In this case you will have to edit the file that handles the execution of the browser. This way you will be sure that the parameters you want will be included when called from everywhere.\nThis is what I mean:\n\n\n*\n\n*Move the original file to a different name\n\n*With the old name of the original file, create a new script calling the original file with the needed parameters.\n\n\nI will show an example of how to do this, using chromium-browser.\nYou will have to be careful when executing the below commands, as super user privileges will be granted, thus you have full rights for your whole system, and, e.g. you can delete or alter everything\n\n\n*\n\n*Backup the old file:\ncp /usr/bin/chromium-browser ~/Documents/backup/\nWhere /usr/bin/chromium-browser is the executable of your browser and ~/Documents/backup/ is an example backup location. In order to find the location of the executable called each time your browser is launched, you can find it from its desktop file, usually in /usr/share/applications.\nThis will copy /usr/bin/chromium-browser to ~/Documents/backup/\n\n\n*\n\n*Move the file to a new name:\nsudo mv /usr/bin/chromium-browser /usr/bin/chromium-original\nThis will rename the executable from chromium-browser to chromium-original\n\n\n*\n\n*Replace the old file's name with a file that passes the parameters you want to the original executable.\n\n\nFor example, in this occasion, create anywhere a file called chromium-browser with the contents:\n#!/bin/bash\n\n/usr/bin/chromium-original --param1 --param2 --param3 \"$@\"\n\nWhere --param1 --param2 --param3 are the parameters you want to be executed each time.\nThe \"$@\" means \"all the parameters passed to this file\", which in this case it is usually a URL.\n\n\n*\n\n*Make the file executable and move it to the old file's location\n\n\nAfter you save the above file, make it executable. Two ways of doing it, either right click->Properties->Permissions->Allow executing file as program or via terminal: chmod +ax chromium-browser\nFinally, move it to the old location of the original executable:\nmv ~/chromium-browser /usr/bin/\n\nwhere ~/chromium-browser the location of the script that you created.\nPlease note that you do not need to do all these if you want to replace one command of the terminal with the same but with other arguments. You can do this into ~/.bash_aliases using an alias. See How to create a permanent \"alias\"? for more information.\n", "Q: How to get back from TTY to Unity I got a problem.

I want to uninstall Jdownloader 2 beta, having taken the steps in this webpage: http://ubuntuhandbook.org/index.php/tag/13-04/. \nApparently, it is a sort of installation with \".sh\" files.

However, I have been trying the same way with \"Jdownloader 2 beta\"  but it does not work out.\n\nA: It's simple. Go to the directory, in /usr/local/jd2/ and there is Unistall JDownloader.\nRight-click and open terminal in this directory. Then just run\nsudo ./Uninstall\\ JDownloader\n\nto start the uninstall.

Nevertheless, I must say I was unable to do it the way they said. I finally discovered the solution, though. It is simple and clear as water.\nFor people who might have the same problem in near/far future, this is the solution: When Ubuntu or whatever is installing \"Jdownloader 2 beta\", it automatically creates a folder in \"home\" destination. So:\n\n\n*\n\n*Go there, find the jd2 folder, and among the considerable number of files look for the one called UnistallalJdownloader, Uninstall Jdownloader, or similar (I deleted it already).\n\n*Click it and press right button, then choose the option \"open with terminal\" and it will eventually launch the uninstall window.\n\n*The rest is simple, follow the instructions and that is it.

That failed to downgrade in the same way. It seems that if apt-get has any knowledge that 1.8.5 exists, it will prefer that over 1.7.14.\nIf there's an easier way, I'd really like to know.\n\nA: You have to tell apt-get to downgrade all the dependencies along:\nsudo apt-get install subversion=1.7.14-1+WANdisco libsvn1=1.7.14-1+WANdisco\n\notherwise apt won't downgrade them.

The last time I used sudo apt-get autoremove, nearly every important display driver or parts got deleted. This made me very squeamish about using the command again.

My question is whether it's safe running the autoremove command, or will I lose everything once again? Is there a way of checking how safe it is to use autoremove in this particular (or any) case?\n\nA: To focus on your past experience, if autoremove is going to remove \"more than you intended\", it's only doing that because those packages are no longer depended upon. That happens when you accidentally remove something :)\nA common example from the good old days would be removing something Compiz-related. apt-get would show you a list of Compiz packages it was going to remove and you'd miss that ubuntu-desktop was also in there. ubuntu-desktop is just a meta-package that depends on all the packages that make up the desktop so removing it doesn't directly remove anything...\n... But when you do an subsequent autoremove, all those things that ubuntu-desktop was the sole dependency... They're going bye-bye.\nA few lessons:\n\n\n*\n\n*sudo apt-get remove <package> will warn you what it's going to remove directly. It won't notify you about knock-on effects.\n\n*sudo apt-get autoremove should also warn you what it's going to do.\n\n*Use apt-get -s autoremove to do a simulated dry run if you're unsure. You can use that  on all apt-get commands.\n\n*If you reboot and you're staring at TTY1 wondering what the monkeys you've nuked this time, /var/log/apt/history.log should have you most recent activity.\n\n*If in doubt, check ubuntu-desktop is installed.\n\n\nIs autoremove safe? It's heavy machinery so it's only as safe as the driver... But that said, it's hard to do permanent damage.\n\nA: \nThe following packages were automatically installed and are no longer required\n\nIf they are no longer required apt will know when it builds the dependencies. apt-get just inform you \"Hey, you removed something that installed these packages. I prefer that you decide what to do with them since you are the boss\".\nNow, it is safe? Yes. What happen if you need em again? apt will download them. Should I check the list? Yes. A light check might be needed.\n\nA: Unsafe example:\napt-get remove --purge icedove*\n\nNever, almost never use an asterisk except for libreoffice\nWith great power comes great responsibility.\nGenerally you should use the synaptic package manager which offers much better presentation (warnings**) then the terminal.\nFor example on debian Jessie (8.2) I noticed imagemagick was not functioning and that there were 2 shortcuts to it in the menu of a default install.  I started with:\napt-get remove --purge imagemagick\n\nThat got rid of one shortcut, then I launched synaptic and two packages were left one of those being imagemagick-common.  Upon selecting that package for complete removal it showed inkscape as the 1st thing that had to be removed as a consequence among many others.\nNow do the same thing in the terminal, and it won't jump at you nearly as much.  It might not phase you at all  unless you're a linux veteran.\n", "Q: How to setup an access point for two wireless networks of which one ends on a VPN?

Okay, what is the difference between Cinnamon and Cinnamon (Software Rendering) when choosing a desktop environment for Ubuntu?\nSub question:\nWhat is the difference between Linux Mint with Cinnamon vs Ubuntu running with the Cinnamon Desktop Environment?\n\nA: That one use Hardware Acceleration awesomesauce, while the other use your CPU to draw effects (boo!).\nNow explaining:\nCinnamon (Software Rendering) the only characteristic is that it uses software rendering to do more of the graphical work, like drawing window borders, moving windows, the bar, etc., and this cannot be changed if you don't have Hardware Acceleration capable GPU.\nThe Cinnamon has Hardware Acceleration capable techniques available. Is more eye-candy and powerful that the software render, since it uses a dedicated graphics card to make that all the effects looks fluid and fast. The advantage of this is that you can fallback to no-effects environment without problems.\n\nA: The only real downside to using hardware acceleration is if you have a buggy driver, you can run into more glitches in the graphics (software rendering is more predictable).  \nFor example, with Linux Mint 17, I see issues with Chromium not fully repainting the screen when re-sizing the windows (if I try to use hardware acceleration).  I can't perceive any speed difference between the two, though I typically turn off all \"eye candy effects\" regardless.\nIf your driver is very buggy, I would imagine hardware acceleration could cause crashes, or your whole system could even run more slowly.  Otherwise, I just try the acceleration first, and drop back to software rendering if I see any weirdness (crashes, lockups, repaint issues, etc).  Hardware acceleration is great if the the drivers work.\n", "Q: Problem to install EasyCam I had problem when I install the Easy Cam\nvitor@vitor-hp:~$ gksudo 'python /usr/share/EasyCam2/core.py --gtk'\nvitor@vitor-hp:~$ kdesudo 'python /usr/share/EasyCam2/core.py --qt'\npython: can't open file '/usr/share/EasyCam2/core.py': [Errno 2] No such file or directory\n\nAccording the documentation I done all the steps. \n\nA: \nThese instructions are only applicable for a previous release of Ubuntu.

Basically since I downloaded Ubuntu 13.10 overtop of my Windows 8, I've regretted it. Mainly because most of the things arnt working, gnome-terminal, software centre, etc. \nCurrently I've done all the things any guide online says to try and fix my Software Centre, I've viewed guides on askubuntu, wikihow, etc etc. None of them worked/work and now I'm getting tired of it.

When explaining things to me, please be very elaborate - I'm very new to Ubuntu.\n\nA: It is probable that you have had an error in the installation procedure. What I would do in your case is reinstall Ubuntu.\nYou may need another PC to accomplish this steps: \n\n\n*\n\n*Check the integrity of the Ubuntu-13.10 ISO. \n\n*If it is OK, run the LiveCD\n\n*Now resize/delete or format partitions in a way to let one for data and the other for Ubuntu. (see How to resize partitions?)\n\n*Install Ubuntu (yes, again) and now everything should work properly.\n\n\nA: All what you need is to type your password correctly onto the dialog box that appears just after you clicked Install/Remove. Debian package management system and the nature of Ubuntu requires the Administrative Rights for system-wide package installation. And the dialog you saw before this error(the password dialog you have cancelled most probably) asks for those rights.\n", "Q: changing device with v4l2-ctl is not working I have a WinTV HVR 1900 TV tuner runnning on Ubuntu 13.10, from which I would like to capture S-VIDEO input.

Do I really need all these, or can I simply comment them out in 25_custom?\nSimilarly, given that the original boot entry for windows in 30_os-prober is defunct, can I just comment it out?\nWhat is the difference between each of these efi boot loaders anyway?\n\nA: The first two are probably duplicate files. I don't know about the third; it could be another duplicate or it could be something Lenovo-specific.\nBackground: The EFI spec says that each OS should install its boot loader in a subdirectory of the EFI directory on the ESP, as in EFI/Microsoft for Windows or EFI/ubuntu for Ubuntu. The EFI/BOOT directory is a special case: It holds a boot loader (bootmgfw.efi) that serves as a fallback in case all others fail. That's also the name that's used for boot loaders on removable media like USB flash drives. Thus, many OSes, including Windows, install two copies of their boot loaders -- once in the official directory and again as EFI/BOOT/bootx64.efi. GRUB tends to pick these both up and present them as options, because they can be different boot loaders, even though they often are not.\nThis is complicated by Boot Repair. Old versions of this program, and new ones if you select a certain option in the Advanced menu, back up both the EFI/Microsoft/Boot/bootmgfw.efi and the EFI/BOOT/bootx64.efi boot loaders (by renaming them with bkp placed at the start of the filename) and place copies of GRUB in their place. This is done to work around bugs in some EFIs. The problem is that this creates additional boot loader files, which can clutter menus and add to confusion when doing manual maintenance. Unless you need to use this backup-and-replace hack because of a broken EFI, I recommend that you not let Boot Repair make this change. Note, however, that this has not caused the duplication you've noted, although it has affected the filenames that GRUB has entered on its chainloader lines.\nPersonally, I'd remove the EFI/BOOT/bkpbootx64.efi (or EFI/BOOT/bootx64.efi) entry, since it could conceivably be changed to something else should some other tool decide to take over that spot. Hijacking the Windows boot loader is a little less likely -- although because of the EFI bug I've noted, at least two tools (Boot Repair and rEFInd's mvrefind.sh script) can do this, and others may do so in the future.\nA tip: The diff command is your friend. Pass it two filenames and it will tell you if they're identical or not. No output indicates that the files are identical. You can use this to discover which .efi files on your system are identical to which other files.\n", "Q: Going to >Applications>Accessories>Terminal If I take the steps as in the title, I end up in a window called:- x@x-Not-Specified:~\nWhat can I do with this application? What is it used for? How can I learn about it?\n\nA: You have started a Terminal program, which gives you access to the Linux command line, similar to the old DOS Prompt or Windows' cmd shell, where you can type in commands and receive information in a text-based format. Expert users can do just about any computer-related task in this environment, but it can be extremely important even for first-time or casual users of Linux operating systems like Ubuntu. You can use it to quickly install, upgrade, or remove packages, manipulate files and folders, check your network connection status, and many more tasks. \nUbuntu is designed in such a way that the command line often isn't necessary for day-to-day use of your computer, as there are graphical programs such as the Software Center or Nautilus, the file browser, that manage many of these routine jobs. However, if you are interested in learning more, there are many resources available to check out. If you'd like a physical book to put on your desk (or even an ebook to put on your tablet), you can't go wrong with Linux in a Nutshell, which I've had for many many years and still reference occasionally.

Open a VNC session and open a console. Then enter:\npasswd\n\nYou will then be prompted for a new password. Enter a good password and then confirm it. Now restart the server and see if the password sticks. Like I said, you should disable root login to your ssh server.

I am completly new to ubuntu and a dual boot system. I have a Toshiba laptop with an i7 processor, 64 bit system with Windows 8 installed. I would like to install ubuntu as a dual boot and want to know if there is anything special I should do or watch for haveing  Windows8 installed. Once ubuntu is installed will I have to reinstall security software that I installed in Windows to protect my pc in ubuntu?\n\nA: Ubuntu will have it's own partition, nothing will change withing Windows, just that you will notice some hard disk space missing that you assinged to Ubuntu.\n\nA: To start off, always install Windows 8 first. Windows 8 will write over the MBR and that will make Ubuntu unbootable if you have it installed. Once Windows 8 is installed, You can dual boot Ubuntu. Ubuntu will make changes to the MBR so that GRUB can boot either Ubuntu or chain boot Windows 8.\nUbuntu is far less prone to viruses than Windows. People will say,\n\nUbuntu can be infected by a virus just as easily as Windows can\n\nThis is kind of true. Ubuntu does have the occasional security hole. The difference is that there are not nearly as many viruses out there for Ubuntu. Ubuntu doesn't need anti-virus and it won't for a very long time (knock on wood). Don't get anti-virus software for Ubuntu, it's a waste.\nIf you are seriously concerned with your security on Ubuntu check out:\n\n\n*\n\n*https://wiki.ubuntu.com/BasicSecurity\nOne thing I would really encourage is for you to encrypt your Ubuntu installation. This way if you get a virus in Windows, then the virus won't be able to infect your Ubuntu installation.\n", "Q: Changing adapter back to managed mode I changed my adapter to monitor mode using:\nsudo ifconfig wlan0 down\nsudo iwconfig wlan0 mode monitor \n\nNow, I cannot change it back (in the GUI, when I click on connections, it says that \"wireless is disabled by wireless switch\").

For example, you'll notice that your eth0 interface is up:\neth0       Link encap:Ethernet  HWaddr 00:24:21:6f:84:69  \n           inet addr:10.100.1.41  Bcast:10.100.255.255  Mask:255.255.0.0\n           inet6 addr: fe80::224:21ff:fe6f:8469/64 Scope:Link\n           UP BROADCAST RUNNING MULTICAST  MTU:1500  Metric:1\n\nYour ifconfig output does not have wlan0 listed, meaning that it has been turned off. If you do ifconfig -a, you should see all interfaces (up or down), and you'll notice that wlan0 won't have UP displayed. And all of this makes complete sense because you switched off your WiFi card when you did ifconfig wlan0 down. So ifconfig wlan0 up should bring it back online. If it doesn't work straight away, do a sudo service network-manager restart.\n\nA: Try using Alpha-Lead's script on GitHub.\nIt provides a nice and easy menu to change modes.\nhttps://github.com/Alpha-Lead/ChangeWirelessMode\n\nA: In my case , I need to turn the radio on at the last step. \nip link dev up     \nnmcli radio all on \n\n\nA: I have tried all the answers provided on the Internet but none of them were working.\nFinally, I got my answer and here it is:\nsudo su\nairmon-ng stop wlan0 && ifconfig wlan0 down && iwconfig wlan0 mode managed && ifconfig wlan0 up && service NetworkManager restart\n\nHere, wlan0 is the network interface name. If yours is different, then change it accordingly.\nYou must remember to run these commands as super user.\n\nA: With ip and iw\nThis gets you back to managed mode and establishes a Wi-Fi connection with your wireless router:\nip link set wlp3s0 down\niw wlp3s0 set type managed\nip link set wlp3s0 up\nsystemctl restart NetworkManager\nnmcli con up your_networks_SSID\n\nIn this example, wlp3s0 is the name of your Wi-Fi interface.\nThe key here is to set the interface state to down to avoid iw's error message:\n\ncommand failed: Device or resource busy (-16)\n\n", "Q: Is Google chrome and chromium are different browser I have Ubuntu 12 in my PC.

So I decided to search for the specifications of your laptop, and there is no mystery, you have the Asus UX31LA-C4018H version, which comes with 2x128 GB SSD-s. See for example here\nIf you still want to combine the drives then you should use LVM. Please see this Q&A for more info on setting up an LVM. \n\nA: http://www.computerbase.de/artikel/notebooks/2013/asus-zenbook-ux301-im-test/  shows the configuration of your Zenbook is, indeed, two each 128GB SSDs. Therefore, I would set up Ubuntu to use sda for the operating system and programs (root) as well as the swap partition. Then, create a new partition using all of sdb as /home and that's where your data will go.\nThe original configuration, RAID0, gives more speed (good for poky ol' Windoze), but less reliability.\n", "Q: Is 1GB DDR2 RAM sufficient for Ubuntu 12.04 LTS 32 bit desktop I have AMD processor with 1 GB DDR2 RAM. I have installed Ubuntu 12.04 LTS Desktop with 32 bit version. Many times when I open 3-4 applications, it hanged and need to restart my PC. Is it due to less RAM or other hardware?\n\nA: Short answer is you can run Ubuntu 12.04 with Unity on 1GB of RAM. It's not practical though. You should switch to a desktop environment that uses less memory. You should try xfce. It uses hardly any RAM compared to Unity and it has great performance on limited hardware.\n\n\n*\n\n*How can I install XFCE along side unity?\n", "Q: unable to delete user I tried to delete a user:\n# deluser someuser\nRemoving user `someuser' ...\nWarning: group `someuser' has no more members.\nuserdel: user someuser is currently logged in\n/usr/sbin/deluser: `/usr/sbin/userdel someuser' returned error code 8.

How can I delete it?\n\nA: If you cannot remove a user that is certainly because some process are still running belong him.\nFirst you can list his process with:\nps -aux | grep someuser\n\nIf that is the case, you can kill all his process with\nsudo pkill -u someuser\n\nThen execute deluser again\ndeluser someuser\n\nor\nsudo deluser someuser\n\n\nA: In the man page of deluser, it says that an error code of 8 indicates that the perl paquet \"perl-modules\" is not installed, maybe you can check this...\nAnyway, if you want to force deletion you can use deluser with -f option\ndeluser -f\n\nbut do it only if you don't find another way, it can produce instability...\nSee man page for more information\n\nA: I encountered the same problem when trying to delete a user that was logged in the first time I tried to delete it. To me, waiting a few seconds was the solution:\nAs I mentioned, the first attempt to delete the user failed for it was still logged in. I then logged out the user and repeated the \nsudo deluser -remove-home <username2delete>\n\ncommand, but the\n/usr/sbin/deluser: `/usr/sbin/userdel <username2delete>' returned error code 8. Exiting.\n\nshowed up again. This time with some process ID that currently seamed to be used by \"username2delete\".\nI checked which users are logged in and there was only one user logged in \"user2stay\".\nI then read your posts and after 2 minutes I tried again the same command as before:\nsudo deluser -remove-home <username2delete>\n\nThis time it worked without problems. There was no reboot necessary nor a forced deluser. Maybe this will help you.\n\nA: I encountered the same problem while trying to delete a user that was connected through a ssh session.  Solution was, first create the new user and add it to desired groups (ie. sudo in case you only have one account). Then logout as current user that you want to delete, ssh again with new user and delete the old account. Of course, if you have other services still running under old user you will need to close those as well.\n", "Q: Trying to issue a command through a Launcher So I am attempting to get a one click minecraft server.

It worked for me.\n\nA: If you are using Ubuntu on the hard disk, then it can cause many problems (because the disk is in use I suppose).\nI would recommend using a Live CD/USB in this case. And the program that I often use is GParted.\n\nA: Try this command, it worked for me:\nsudo apt-get install cryptsetup\n\nBy default cryptsetup is not installed during Ubuntu installation, and that package is required to open encrypted partitions.\n", "Q: Problem with setting wallpaper using gsettings I used gsettings set org.gnome.desktop.background picture-uri 'file://PathToImage' to set an image as a wallpaper as suggested in this answer. This does not do the job properly. For today's bing image, script here changes my background like this\n\nThis happens at random and sometimes it sets the wallpaper properly. Using GUI, setting the image as wallpaper by right-clicking on it works properly every time. Any possible causes of this problem?\nEdit1: The download is perfectly fine. As I have mentioned, I can set the photo as wallpaper by right clicking the photo and chosing 'set as wallpaper' from the menu.\n\nA: You mentioned\n\nThe download is perfectly fine. As I have mentioned, I can set the photo as wallpaper by right clicking the photo and chosing 'set as wallpaper' from the menu.\n\nAs you can manually set the wallpaper the problem may be on the cache, which is generated before the downloader completely write the data on the file. So regenerating the cache in this kind of case is necessary.\nSo delete wallpaper cache rm /home/$USER/.cache/wallpaper/* .\nAdd this code to end of the script after some sleep.\nLet's do a test\n\n*\n\n*Find and open the image cache of current wallpaper from /home/$USER/.cache/wallpaper/\n\n*Edit the image ( such as rotate clockwise. You can do it with the default imageg viwer (GNOME image viewer) using Ctrl+R (Or from edit -> rotate))\n\n*Logout and login ubuntu (or restart)\n\nThat's it now you can see the changes on the desktop wallpaper (If you rotated the image, then the wallpaper will also get rotated)\n\nA: The following command is correct and should work in any circumstance:\ngsettings set org.gnome.desktop.background picture-uri 'file://PathToImage'\n\nSo, I assume that the main reason why this thing is happen is because, as @d3vid noted in his comment: the download is failing (only downloading a partial file) or the background is being displayed before the download is complete.\nTo solve your problem be sure that you have a better internet connection when you run the script from your question or try to use curl instead of wget as in the script from my answer here.\n\nA: Maybe in the script, you should first download the new picture in a temporary file like:\nwget --no-proxy --output-document=dwallpaper.temp (...)\n\nAnd only after the wget command is done, do:\ncp dwallpaper.temp dwallpaper\n\nThis way, gsettings is always pointing to a file 100% downloaded which may fix the issue you observed.\n", "Q: how to use the terminal with linux 13.10? I would like to know how can I use the terminal? The functionality of commands. I don't know how can I use the terminal for download movies or software.\n\nA: From a combination of your post and subsequent comment I think there is some misunderstanding of what the terminal is/does. The terminal is a non-graphical interface for you to communicate with your computer. This gives you a great deal of control over your PC as no program has a button for every terminal command (and if one did it would be so full of buttons it would be impossible to use!)\nGraphical programs, take your inputs, and essentially run terminal-like commands. This means that downloading a file from the terminal is not intrinsically \"safer\" than downloaded the same file from your browser. The important issue is the content of the file that you have downloaded. It is also arguable that the terminal is less safe in the hands of a confused user as it is much easier to \"accidentally\" give a downloaded file root (administrator) permissions by just copying commands you have seen online (in this case sudo).\nIf you want to download movies \"safely\" the only real option is a reliable (and therefore probably legal) source (but, not that all legal sources a malware free!!).\nFor software. Illegal software is again less likely to be safe (also not legal to download!). You can download free legal packages in the terminal from ubuntu's repositories. For this you need the name and run:\nsudo apt-get install PACKAGENAME\n\nBut if you are just browsing you can use the Ubuntu software centre. This is equally \"safe\". There is a lot to choose from.\n", "Q: Beginner in networking please help - file sharing Hello I am new to Linux Ubuntu, I have a spare PC laying around and I wanted to make it a file/media sharing server.

Not all programs and games use gtk/gnome and will quickly pull in the relevant kde libraries needed to work...\n\nA: Some of your unity package may use KDE dependencies.\nYou can check from your console what package use your KDE dependencies with :\n apt-cache rdepends {package}\n\n\nA: This happens quite often when you install a program that requires KDE libraries. For example, when you install K3b, the popular disk burning software, it requires all this:\nk3b\nReverse Depends:\n  kmediafactory\n  dvd95\n |uck\n  quodlibet-plugins\n  kubuntu-full\n  kubuntu-desktop\n  k3b-i18n\n  k3b-dbg\n  juk\n |aptoncd\n\nas you can see, it requires several kubuntu libraries, and when you use the application it uses those programs, as that is what it was written to interact with. \nThus, when an update occurs, those programs installed as dependencies are also updated.\n", "Q: help installing nmap 6.40 on 12.04 im trying to install \ni tried following

configure the build without the ncat component i.e. run \n./configure --without-ncat\n\nand then perform the make and make install steps again. Since you used sudo for the make step last time you will likely need to do so again, since any object files will have been created with root ownership - however it would be preferable to fix the original ownership / permissions issue. \n\nIf you do need to build the ncat component, then you will probably have to edit the corresponding Makefile, as described here on ubuntuforums.org\nYou can read more about library link-order in the gcc documentation or see for example Linker order - GCC on stackoverflow\n\nA: Just download the rpm and run the following script:\nalien nmap-6.47-1.x86_64.rpm\n\nthen you will have the deb file to install via\ndpkg -i nmap_6.47-2_amd64.deb\n\n", "Q: Juju gui problem with login Hello i have installed maas and juju, now that i want to login juju's gui there is user and password\nuser-admin\npassword \ni have tried the password from my environments.yaml but no success. \nI use the ip address of the node to login \n\nhttps://'192.168.50.103'/login\n\n, but i can't the address of the maas server is \n\n192.168.50.101/MAAS\n\n.\nIs the username user-admin wrong? \nAny advices ?\n\nA: user-admin is correct.\nIt sounds like you are on the right track, and I can't tell exactly how to help you from your description.  My best guess is that you are not extracting the right password from your ~/.juju/environments.yaml file.  Make sure that you are looking at the stanza for your MAAS environment.  If you see a line that says\nadmin-secret: aaaAAAbbbBBB111222333\n\nthen you should be able to use aaaAAAbbbBBB111222333 as the password.\nI hope that helps.\n", "Q: setup norton dns in ubuntu 12.04 I want to setup Norton DNS for my Ubuntu 12.04 for all network connections?

I'm using Ubuntu 12.04.3 with NVidia drivers (319) for my Quadro K2100M graphic card, and when I switch my main 3200x1800 laptop screen to mode 1920x1080 (using nvidia-settings), the display goes blurry...\nI am using two screens: \n\n\n*\n\n*My main screen is a LCD with max resolution 1920x1200.\n\n*My laptop screen (original resolution 3200x1800) is sitting to the right of that.\n\n\nThe main problem is that, on Ubuntu, the font is far too small on my laptop screen. Because of that, I wanted to change the resolution of my laptop to 1920x1080.\nReading Galgalesh's answer, I tried to compute my DPI and here is the DPI configuration which I should have:\n\n\n*\n\n*94x94 for my main LCD screen 1920x1200\n\n*235x236 for my 3200x1800 laptop screen\n\n\nIs there a way to have dual DPI resolutions with an extended desktop?\n\nA: I used artmem's solution but ran into the mouse problem mentioned by  EoghanM. The workaround I found in the old bug report he linked to related to --panning.\nI'm shooting for:\n - DP1-2 3840x2160 in native DIP.\n - eDP1 1366x768, scaled to look reasonable to the right of DP1-2.\nI get this to happen by having a frame buffer that is like DP1-2 + (2x eDP1) then I scale everything going to eDP1 by 1/2.\nThis should be simple but xrandr is a bit tricky.\nHere --scale  is used to reduce everything going to eDP1 by 1/2. --panning is the same as eDP1 in the original frame buffer with the position (+3840+0) of just to the right of DP1-2. +0+2160 would be below it.\nxrandr -d :0 --fb 6572x3696 --output DP1-2 --mode 3840x2160 --scale 1x1 --rate 60 --pos 0x0 --primary\n\n# sometimes panning get applied incorrectly when switching from some other mode, running it twice is a work around\nxrandr -d :0 --output eDP1 --off\nxrandr -d :0 --fb 6572x3696 --output eDP1  --mode 1366x768  --scale 2x2 --panning 2732x1536+3840+0\nxrandr -d :0 --fb 6572x3696 --output eDP1  --mode 1366x768  --scale 2x2 --panning 2732x1536+3840+0\n\nI also set Xft.dpi to 185 \n$ cat ~/.Xresources\nXft.dpi: 185\n\nWhen I unplug from the external monitor I run :\nxrandr -d :0 --output DP1-2 --off\nxrandr -d :0 --fb 2732x1536 --output eDP1  --mode 1366x768  --scale 2x2 --panning 2732x1536+0+0 --pos 0x0 --primary\n\nThat doesn't look great but I'm not away from my desk much. You could get around this by changing Xft.dpi and restarting all your desktop programs. I don't know of a way to change Xft.dpi and then get clients to use it without restarting them.\n\nA: Why is it blurry?\nYour screen always displays 3200x1800 pixels. If you lower the screen resolution on your computer that just means that your screen has to scale the image to fit your screen. Depending on the ratio between your native resolution and the current resolution, that scaling will produce a blurry image.\nYou can find more information on scaling and native resolution here: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Native_resolution\nHow can I make the text bigger?\nIf the text is too small you have two options: \n1. Change Ubuntu's font size\nHow do I change fonts and adjust their size?\n2. Change DPI (will make the whole interface bigger, not only text)\nHow to find and change the screen DPI? (answer by @whtyger)\n\nA: These answers are all great, and helped me previously, but a recent \nsudo apt-get upgrade \n\ndeleted my randr-config! In attempting to restore my settings I found I could no longer get the mouse beyond the top 1/4th quadrant of the second screen, no matter the --fb input. From https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/HiDPI#Side_display I eventually discovered that adding panning did the trick. Also, use of '--right-of' or '--left-of' is simpler than '--pos'.\n\"Generically if your HiDPI monitor (laptop) is AxB pixels and your regular monitor (external) is CxD and you are scaling by [ExF], the commandline for right-of is:\"\nxrandr --output eDP-1 --auto --output HDMI-1 --auto --panning [C*E]x[D*F]+[A]+0 --scale [E]x[F] --right-of eDP-1\n\n\nA: I had a similar problem and solved it this way.\nI have an external big screen 24\" 3840x2160 and a laptop same definition 3840x2160 but small screen 15.4\"\nI wanted the laptop screen to be zoomed because default scaling is too small ..\nScaling down with xrandr as we usually see results in blurry screen, the solution is to scale everything up with xrandr then use gnome scaling factor :\nHere is how to do it (external screen on top of laptop screen but you can arrange in a different way if you change pos parameters)\nxrandr \\\n    --output DP-0 --primary --mode 3840x2160  --pos 0x0 --scale 2x2  --rotate normal \\\n    --output DP-2 --mode 3840x2160 --pos 0x4320 --scale 1x1  --rotate normal \\\n    --output DP-1 --off\n\nExplanations :\n--output : DP-1 is the external screen, DP-2 is the laptop screen (use xrandr -q to get your devices names)\n--mode : both screen have same definitions 3840x2160\n--scale 2x2 for external, 1x1 for laptop, this is \"relative\" to the primary which is external screen here..\n--pos : external screen is at position 0x0, laptop screen is bellow at pos 0x(2160*2)=0x4320 because external screen is scalled by 2\n\nThen\ngsettings set org.gnome.desktop.interface scaling-factor 2\n\nOR\ngsettings set org.gnome.settings-daemon.plugins.xsettings overrides \"{'Gdk/WindowScalingFactor': <2>}\"\n\n\n\nA: I was able to solve this (with issues) using the details outlined in the following github discussion: https://github.com/linuxmint/Cinnamon/issues/3606\nExternal Monitor QHD (2560X1440), Internal/Laptop Monitor 3200x1800\nxrandr --output eDP-1 --scale 1x1 --pos 0x2880\nxrandr --output DP-1 --mode 2560x1440 --scale 2x2 --fb 5120x4680\n\nOR \nExternal Monitor FHD (1920x1080), Internal/Laptop Monitor 3200x1800\nxrandr --output eDP-1 --scale 1x1 --pos 0x2160\nxrandr --output DP-1 --mode 1920x1080 --scale 2x2 --fb 3840x3960\n\nThese work, but there is a significant amount to tearing in the high resolution monitor (laptop) when I move windows, resize screens or scroll on a browser. This feels like a software rending solution (which has all these issues of tearing, and slow refreshes).\nIts 2017, Linux/Gnome needs to address the multi-monitor, mixed scaling solution. Both Windows 10 and OS X have this resolved without having to resort to command line band-aid fixes that partially work (the tearing issue isn't acceptable for gaming)\n\nA: I spend hours to solve this issue. I have a 4k laptop and 1080p external monitor. If I set scaling to \"200%\" external monitors displays enlarged icons text etc.\nI tried xrandr commands with \"--scale\" but they didnt give me the expected results. So I have a xrandr command that works perfectly for me. I wish somebody else find it helpful.\nxrandr --output HDMI-1-1 --mode 1920x1080 --pos 0x0 --rate 60.00 --transform 2,0,0,0,2,0,0,0,1 --output eDP-1-1 --mode 3840x2160 --pos 0x2160 --primary --rate 60.00\n\nThis commands works as external monitor scaled to \"100%\" and built-in screen scaled to \"200%\". This commands places external monitor above the built-in. Keep in mind you probably will change --output names with yours.\nNote that 2160 in --pos 0x2160 has nothing to do with the height of eDP-1-1 (it just happens by chance to be the same value in my case). That number is in fact the height of the upper monitor (1080 in my case) corrected by the transformation (so 1080*2 in my case).\nThis is because --pos refers to the position of the upper left corner in the virtual screen space, so the bottom screen has to be positioned relative to the height of the upper screen.\nFinally, you can ignore --rate flags. The most important flag here is --transform. And positions depends on screen resolutions and placements. Using this commands I have a Arandr preview like this;\n\n1080p monitor is virtually adjusted to take up twice as much space. Thanks to monitors are perfectly aligned, when I move the mouse from one screen to another, it appears on same horizontal coordinate\n\nA: I have an outdated 1024x768 monitor, connected to a (less outdated) notebook.\nThe windows rendered in quite different sizes, much bigger in the external monitor (which has an older, bigger dot pitch).\nI found a command to scale the monitor:  \nxrandr --output VGA-1 --scale 1.5x1.5\n\nVGA-1 is the internal name of the monitor, found by running the following command:  \nxrandr --current | grep connected\n\nThe effect is that now the old monitor displays its contents at almost the same size as the notebook.  \nCuriously enough, it works scaling x1.5 but not 1.45, the display (in my case) turns black.  \nWhen I ran the scale comment the first time the result was frightening because the contents of both screens overlapped. For example the cursor pointer appeared twice.  \nI ran a program:  \narandr &\n\nto set the relative screen positions to fix it.\nIt works like the Settings > Devices > Displays setting.  \nI installed it with:  \nsudo apt-get install arandr\n\nThanks @LuisAlvarado and others for sharing your knowledge!  \n\nA: On Ubuntu 20.04, for me clicking Fractional Scaling option in the bottom of display settings resolved everything. This will allow to scale each monitor separately.\n\nA: It seems people are still struggling trying to work with several monitors and HiDPI displays.\nA good workaround is described in arch wiki https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/HiDPI#Multiple_displays.\nSo, I have:\n\n\n*\n\n*laptop asus ln303ux: 3200x1800,\n\n*external monitor:    1920x1200\n\n\nNow I use Ubuntu 14.10 & GNOME Shell 3.12.2 that has pretty usable HiDPI support.\nSo I just use out-of-the-box support of HiDPI - scaling factor is 2 (it can be set up via GUI).\nThat means that on external monitor I get everything twice bigger than acceptable.\nThus, I use xrandr; but instead of downscaling laptop screen, I upscale external monitor screen:\nxrandr --output HDMI1 --scale 2x2 --mode 1920x1200 --fb 3840x4200 --pos 0x0\nxrandr --output eDP1 --scale 1x1 --pos 320x2400\n\nSo, one by one:\n\n\n*\n\n*--output HDMI1 in my case is the external screen, eDP1 is the laptop screen.\n\n*--scale 2x2 - make everything on external screen twice smaller\n\n*--mode XxY - explicitly set the resolution for screen (not necessary if is already set)\n\n*--fb XxY - set size of a virtual screen (framebuffer) (important without this, you will be able to use only a fourth part of the screen). In my case one screen was on top of another, so I added up effective heights 2400+1800=4200. Also note, that maximum framebuffer size might be specified in xorg.conf - then you cannot exceed it (it is written in the first line of xrandr -q output).\n\n*--pos XxY - in my case I set absolute positioning of the screens, so my laptop screen is directly on the bottom of the external screen. The value Y here is double the external monitor height.\n\n\nAnd this is it!

I have no experience using Ubuntu before\nI'm doing a point of sale project for a restaurant which will run in local Lan (offline not online). I will setup one mini PC as an Ubuntu web server. and my client will access into it via local lan via http request. The server will be placed inside the restaurant.\nIs it possible to protect from someone who wants to steal my file or clone the entire disk and use it with another restaurant?\nOr Ubuntu already has some mechanism inside to protect someone from doing this, e.g. password require before transfer file out of the computer? or password needed before clone the disk?\nI know nothing about Ubuntu, can you please tell me the easiest way to protect my project from being stolen?\n\nA: Disk encryption only works to the point where you've got somebody manually unlocking it. If the server can boot itself and start up without human interaction, if somebody gains access, they've got the data.\nHere are a few ideas ranging from basic to silly.\n\n\n*\n\n*Lock the server in a box. Bolt the box to a wall. Treat it like a safe.\n\n*Make the restaurant contractually liable for the physical security of the software. Make it known that their copy is watermarked and if it ends up on a torrent site, they're liable for the lost sales. But do it without sounding like a douche.\n\n*Physical port blocking: Blank off any USB, serial, etc ports.\n\n*Glue SATA cables into their ports (and block other SATA ports).\n\n*Lock the BIOS. Disable other SATA ports. Disable USB. Disable everything you're not using.\n\n*Rebuild the kernel with make localmodconfig so the only drivers your kernel has is for the hardware it's dealing with.\n\n*Consider full-disk encryption with a physical key like a smart card or a good biometric system. Staff will leave smartcards in (because they've got better things to do) but biometric might work if you implement some sort of auto-shutdown at the end of the day.\n\n*Physical DRM. Dongles devices that form part of the code execution. They're really expensive to create and aren't insurmountable (cite: Autocad's torrid and failed relationship with dongles).\n\n*\"Phone home\" if the server is opened. Script something up that looks at internal light levels. If they increase dramatically, trigger a SMS via an attached dongle (you might be introducing a new attack vector).\n\nA lot of these things don't just make the server more secure, they make it much less robust and harder to fix... Most of these countermeasures are at least an extra point of failure.\nConsider that with most applications, their maximum shelf-life is five years. Making this cheap enough not to bother stealing might be a better strategy.\n\nA: Well if you are running a web server people can only access the files broadcast by the server. So this will be one directory and it's subdirectories. You can control access to these files further. Normally a standard server setup does not give access to scripts like PHP as they are run on the server. However, HTML and javascript code are always going to be possible to copy as that is how the web works. You send the HTML to their PC where it is rendered.\n", "Q: how to setup an alias apache2 I am new to UBUNTU and try to use apache to check a website that I am currently developing using Joomla (novice to that too).

The script looks like this (unix only): >\n\n#!/bin/bash\nexport XDEBUG_CONFIG=\"idekey=xdebug\"\n/usr/bin/php \"$@\"\n<\nRun \"chmod +x\" on the file and put it somewhere in your $PATH list, and you can\nthen use this instead of php when debugging. For instance, instead of \"php\nmyscript.php\", run \"php-xdebug myscript.php\" to start the debugger session.\n\n\nA: The PATH is a list of folders which are automatically checked for executables when you run a program name. Here is what we do.\nAfter the comment below there seems to be more of a problem so lets start from scratch.\nOpen gedit\nPaste in\n#!/bin/bash\nexport XDEBUG_CONFIG=\"idekey=xdebug\"\n/usr/bin/php \"$@\"\n\nSave as\nphp-xdebug.sh\n\nGo to the folder (in the terminal) with the file and run\nchmod +x php-xdebug.sh\n\nThen check what your PATH is with:\necho $PATH\n\nYou could move the file into one of the folders listed when you ran this command.\nNormally a better solution is to edit the PATH (tutorial here)  to search inside the folder where the script already is.\nNow try:\nphp-xdebug.sh\n\n\nA: On Ubuntu (including Lubuntu), one natural place to put such a script is in ~/bin. If that folder does not exist already, do\nmkdir ~/bin\n\nNext time you log in, it will be automatically included in PATH, i.e. no need to alter the PATH variable.\n", "Q: Apache configure file: how to edit it I need to edit the Apache configure file because I wish to set the debugger port in my VirtualHost section as it says below.

I'm using Ubuntu 13.04 Unity  and just decided to try out email client \"Geary\", version 0.4.3. I find it to be quite nice, but the only problem I have right now, is that I have to have it open all the time. It's anoying to have it there in my \"Tab-switch-pop-up?\".\nIs there a way to run it in the background (checking for emails etc.) ?\nThank you.\n\nA: First:\nsudo apt-get install alltray\n\nThen:\nalltray geary\n\nYou may allso add this command to the list of apps loaded at startup.\n\nA: This is already a known bug/feature people want.\nGeary doesn't have an official daemon, as far as I know, so it wouldn't be able check for new emails and other normal background tasks.\nSee here: http://redmine.yorba.org/issues/4570 and here: https://bugs.launchpad.net/geary/+bug/1053205\nEDIT: Here's the bugzilla tracker link: https://bugzilla.gnome.org/show_bug.cgi?id=713734\nFrom the yorba page:\n\nA poor-man's solution would be to set Geary to run at login and hide\n  the main window. Geary would notify of incoming mail as normal. When\n  the user \"ran\" Geary, the window would instantly appear with the most\n  current mail ready to read. When the user closed Geary, it would hide\n  the window again.\nOf course, some users don't like applications running in the\n  background, but pragmatically speaking, this is not terribly different\n  than running Geary as a background daemon that the client connects to\n  via DBus. We should have some way for the user to force Geary closed\n  and, of course, for them to configure Geary not to start at login.\n\ncould be a temporary fix.\nHope you solve your problem!\n\nA: Edit the startup file of geary (~/.config/autostart) and change to:\nTryExec=geary --hidden\n\nAlso delete the option  NoDisplay=true.\n", "Q: Shift running X window (display environment) on SSH X11 forwarding I want to see remotely some running GUI application without kill the current process, I have tried vnc and xrdp, xrdp opens a new blank session, so it is not for me, vnc is good, but not exactly what I need, it uses the screen and devices presents, someone could mess with me moving the mouse or typing on the keyboard.\nTherefore I figured out the only way I could do what I need is managing to shift a running X window from one display to another, thus even on a SSH -X (X11 forwarding) I would be able to see it.\nI am on this quest for a long time and I didn't found out a conclusive solution, that is the reason I am appealing to you. Could you help me to solve this trouble?\nThanks,\n\nA: Thank you folks, but another friend found a better answer, I want to share with the world for someone with the same problem:\nThere is some tools such as xmove and Xpra that works as a X proxy, allowing you to retain the window opened in a kind of virtual X Server, and catch the window to your environment when you need, exactly what I need!\nThanks dudes.\n\nA: VNC is basically the only way to get what you want. You cannot change the active DISPLAY of a running program in X11. You'd have to close the current program and run it again on the new DISPLAY. There are also many other services which may be in use by currently running programs, which also require the same DISPLAY and which require other environment settings, which are not present when you use ssh -X to connect to a remote machine.\n\nA: (If I understand your question correctly) Try looking into tmux or screen as possible answers here.

Whenever I try to take a screen-shot (in my Ubuntu 12.04 box ) with the global menu, context menu for any window/file, it doesn't work. I don't seem to be able to take snapshots with menu dropped down. How do I get this fixed?\nPS. The problem is in both Unity and Gnome3 environments.\n\nA: This is not a \"problem\". You'll get the exact same kind of issue with another operating system like Windows.\nTo take snapshots with menu dropped down you have to use a specialized tool such as Shutter. You'll find this free and open-source tool in Ubuntu Software Center.

Like any other PPA, updates delivered through the PPA depends on the owner of the PPA providing those updates, and in a timely manner.

The selected disk is not of the GPT partition style\"\nI have Ubuntu currently installed but nothing else and have created space for the Windows installation using GParted.\nI don't have a disk drive so have created a bootable USB with Windows 7 on it.\nI have tried zeroing the free partition space and converting it to NTFS but they both didnt work.\nHas anybody got a solution to the problem? Kind regards.\n\nA: Windows ties its boot partition table type (MBR vs. GPT) to its boot mode (BIOS/CSM/legacy vs. EFI/UEFI), so if the disk is pre-partitioned, the boot mode must match the existing partition table.\nYour question is inconsistent about the current partition table: The question title says you're using GPT, but the quoted error message indicates that the disk is not GPT. My memory (and a Google search) suggests that this error message normally lacks the negation, so I suspect you've mis-quoted it. If so, then the problem is that you've booted Windows in BIOS/CSM/legacy mode. The solution is to boot in EFI/UEFI mode. This can be difficult, because the Windows 7 disc doesn't always want to boot in EFI mode. (But see below for a suggestion.) Also, in order to do this, your computer must have EFI firmware. This option is common in computers sold in the last 2-2.5 years, but is uncommon on older computers. If you've got a BIOS-only computer, you have only four options, AFAIK:\n\n\n*\n\n*Use a second disk for Windows. This second disk can use MBR, while the existing one can use GPT. Note that Windows can use a GPT disk as a data disk even on a BIOS-based computer; it just can't boot from a GPT disk in BIOS mode.\n\n*Convert the disk from GPT to MBR. You can do this with gdisk; see here for details. Note that you'll need to re-install GRUB after doing this conversion, and there are other caveats described on that page, so read it thoroughly and be prepared!\n\n*Use DUET or Clover to add an EFI as a BIOS-mode boot loader. This is awkward in many ways, and it's unlikely to work if you've got an AMD CPU, but it might be worth considering if you're desperate enough.\n\n*Use a hybrid MBR to make Windows see the disk as an MBR disk, even while Linux uses the GPT. As the linked-to page details, though, hybrid MBRs are ugly and dangerous, so I consider this the worst of the four options, absent further information that would rule out both of the other three.\n\n\nIf I've misinterpreted and the disk is actually MBR, then you've got the opposite problem; but it's likely to be easier to coax the Windows installation disc into booting in BIOS/CSM/legacy mode. Usually this can be done by using the computer's built-in boot manager, which you can usually access by pressing Esc or a function key early in the boot process. With any luck, you'll see two options for the optical disc, one with \"EFI\" or \"UEFI\" in its description and one without. Use the EFI/UEFI option to boot in that mode, and the other one to boot in BIOS/CSM/legacy mode.\n", "Q: How to change permissions on mounted windows share?

This was solved by means of a startup script with essentially the following contents:\n#!/bin/bash\n\nSESSION_LAST_COMMAND=\n\nlog_last_command() {\n    local command\n\n    command=$(history 1 | sed -e \"s/^[ ]*[0-9]*[ ]*//\")\n\n    if [[ -n \"$SESSION_LAST_COMMAND\" ]]; then\n        logger -p local3.notice \"shell user [$$]: Executed command: $command\"\n    fi\n\n    SESSION_LAST_COMMAND=\"$command\"\n}\n\nexport PROMPT_COMMAND=log_last_command\n\nIt works fine except that pressing ENTER logs the last command again. This happens as many times as the enter key is pressed. And some users do have this habit! Is there a way to avoid these extra logs? Also, an obvious expectation from the solution will that a distinction between just pressing enter a few times and actually re-running the command be possible.\n\nA: I managed to solve the problem of repeated command logging triggered by the ENTER key by replacing the \"history 1\" invocation by \"history -a >(tee -a $HISTFILE)\". Subsequently, after the last command has been found and logged, \"history -c; history -r\" is run to remove all entries from the Bash's in-memory command list and regenerate the list from whatever has been saved in the history file. This is necessary to get only a single command the next time \"history -a\" is executed. Here is the solution:\nsession_log_command() {\n    local status=$?\n    local command\n    local cwd\n\n    cwd=$PWD\n\n    command=$(history -a >(tee -a $HISTFILE))\n\n    if [[ -n \"$command\" ]]; then\n        logger -p local3.notice \"shell user [$$]: Executing command [CWD=$cwd ; $status]: $command\"\n        history -c; history -r\n    fi\n}\n\nexport PROMPT_COMMAND=session_log_command\n\n\nA: If you look in each user's home directory, they should be a file called .bash_history. This is a hidden file, so in Nautilus you need to press Ctrl+H to view it, or with ls you need to use the -a option. This will contain the last 1000 commands the user has entered. So I would of thought you could just regularly log that file, instead of using the history command...\n", "Q: Bumblee settings I have installed bumblebee on my lenovo W530 with Ubuntu 13.10.

I have ordered a VPS with Ubuntu 13.04 on it.  The VPS reports that the kernel is a 2.6.x-series kernel.\nFrom what I have read, Ubuntu 13.04 has at least the 3.8.x series of kernels.  Is there a reason that my VPS is seeing a 2.6.x series kernel, and not a 3.8.x series kernel?\n\nA: Okay, so, I edited your question to make it more general, but...\nTo answer your issue specifically, in which you use the INIZ VPS provider (based on pre-edit version of your question):\nI did look up the VPS provider you said you used (before my edits to your question, so it's more general) ,the INIZ VPS provider.\nThey have two solutions listed on their site: VZ solutions (Budget VPS and SSD VPS), and KVM solutions (KVM VPS).\nI am assuming that, in your case, you have a Budget VPS or an SSD VPS from INIZ.  That uses the OpenVZ solution for virtualization, which means the host system has a 2.6.x kernel on it, and that's what your system sees.\n\n\nNow, for a more general explanation of this problem, and to answer your question fully:\nDepending on the VPS provider, and the virtualization system being used (OpenVZ, KVM, XEN, etc.), the kernel that is on the VPS is either that of the host system or is a kernel installed inside the VPS.\nThe three biggest ones I've seen are OpenVZ, KVM, and XEN, so I'll talk about those three here, however, there are other virtualization systems out there, but I don't know about those.\n\nWith OpenVZ VPSes, the kernel that the VPS sees is the kernel that is on the host node, which in this case is running 2.6.x kernels.\n\nWith KVM VPSes, the kernel for the VPS is the kernel that is installed inside the VPS, and that will be, for Ubuntu, whatever comes with 13.04 or 13.10 or whatever.\n\nI did discuss with my friends who are heavy into virutalization and stuff, they said that for XEN VPSes, XEN can be configured one of two ways:\n\n\n*\n\n*with ParaVirtual Ops, which means the VPS can have a custom kernel inside it (i.e. what comes with Ubuntu or a custom kernel you compile)\n\n*without ParaVirtual Ops, which means the VPS will have the host system's kernel exposed and used with the VPS. (similarly to OpenVZ)\n\n\n(These same friends confirmed what I said above about OpenVZ and KVM, as well)\n", "Q: Debugging PHP in Ubuntu (Xdebug) PHP Vim Debugger: Configuring Apache\nI am trying to install Vdebug to debug PHP in Vim. Unfortunately, when I press F5 this message appears after a few seconds \nWaiting for a connection (Ctrl-C to cancel, this message will self-destruct in\n20  seconds...)\nNo connection was made\n\nWhat should I do?\nI searched about this in Google, followed this tutorial and this one (and many others) but did not work. \nI followed Vdebug instructions. \nI do not know how to achieve this:\nEdit your apache configure file\n\nIn your VirtualHost section, set debugger port same as the one in your vimrc:\n\nphp_value xdebug.remote_port **9009**\n\nThe remote_port that has just been mentioned is different from what I have in xdebug.ini and vimrc.

Using an IDE is not an option: I wish to use Vim.\n\nA: I solved it and now Vdebug is working. \nEnable xdebug in PHP\nEdit your php.ini file and add the following under the \"Module Settings\" section:\n;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;\n; Module Settings ;\n;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;\n\nzend_extension=/path/to/my/xdebug.so\n\n[debug]\n\n; Remote settings\n\nxdebug.remote_autostart=off\n\nxdebug.remote_enable=on\n\nxdebug.remote_handler=dbgp\n\nxdebug.remote_mode=req\n\nxdebug.remote_host=localhost\n\nxdebug.remote_port=9000\n\n; General\n\nxdebug.auto_trace=off\n\nxdebug.collect_includes=on\n\nxdebug.collect_params=off\n\nxdebug.collect_return=off\n\nxdebug.default_enable=on\n\nxdebug.extended_info=1\n\nxdebug.manual_url=http://www.php.net\n\nxdebug.show_local_vars=0\n\nxdebug.show_mem_delta=0\n\nxdebug.max_nesting_level=100\n\n;xdebug.idekey=\n\n; Trace options\n\nxdebug.trace_format=0\n\nxdebug.trace_output_dir=/tmp\n\nxdebug.trace_options=0\n\nxdebug.trace_output_name=crc32\n\n; Profiling\n\nxdebug.profiler_append=0\n\nxdebug.profiler_enable=0\n\nxdebug.profiler_enable_trigger=0\n\nxdebug.profiler_output_dir=/tmp\n\nxdebug.profiler_output_name=crc32\n\nTry it out\nEverything should be ready to go now. Restart apache and run phpinfo() to see if any xdebug information comes up. If it doesn't, then the apache error_log + google are your friends.\nOtherwise, you are ready to run the debugger inside vim.\nOpen a PHP script in VIM that you can access from your localhost\nOpen that same PHP script in your web browser\nAdd F5. You should see at the bottom of VIM like \"waiting for a new connection on port 9000 for 10 seconds...\"\nWithin the next 10 seconds, refresh the browser page with the ?XDEBUG_SESSION_START=1 on the end of the URL.\nGo back to VIM and you're in the debugger in all its glory.\nDon't forget: to switch between windows in VIM, press CTRL-w-w.\nSource -it applies to Ubuntu though it refers to another linux distribution-\nHope this helps.  \n", "Q: Restoring backup I used rsync to back up my data from Vbox. I replaced the fstab of the backup with the fstab of a fresh install. I then used that data to restore everything on the same fresh install. Now I'm unable to update my grub as no commands work. I have permission denied on every command. Is there a way to get back those permissions. And if not is there any way by which I can use all the applications and settings of my Vbox install on the fresh install. I have access to that Vbox install. Also I have a complete rsync backup of that install on an external drive. \n\nA: What do you want to restore? Usually you backup only your home folder, and some other stuff you need that you have put somewhere.\nI do not recommend you to restore the whole system, well you can do that, but that is usually not what you want to do. Follow this guide if you really want to backup the whole system. \nTaking care of grub can be a bit of a hassle. I suggest you mount all your backed up stuff, then bind /dev, /sys and /proc into the mounted root and chroot into the restored root. In there you can use grub-install /dev/<something> to install grub.\nSomething like:\nmount /dev/sdBla /mnt/new_root\nmount -o bind /dev /mnt/new_root/dev \nmount -o bind /sys /mnt/new_root/sys \nmount -t proc /proc /mnt/new_root/proc\nchroot /mnt/new_root\n\nThe permission denied is strange, is assume you are root?

I have 64-bit Ubuntu Unity 12.10.  \nFirst I ran\nsudo apt-get install xsltproc \n\nThen I clicked accept on the Epson website here.  I downloaded iscan-data_1.25.0-1_all.deb and installed it with\nsudo dpkg -i iscan-data_1.25.0-1_all.deb \n\nNext, after some trial and error (because there were several .deb files to choose from, but only one would install successfully), I downloaded iscan_2.29.3-1~usb0.1.ltdl7_amd64.deb and ran\nsudo dpkg -i iscan_2.29.3-1~usb0.1.ltdl7_amd64.deb \n\nNext, as suggested here, I ran\nsudo gedit /etc/sane.d/epkowa.conf\n\nand inserted a line below in the Examples section: net xxx, where for xxx I inserted my best guess at the IP address of the printer.\nFinally, from my Dash Home, I typed \"epson\", and a new application `Image Scan for Linux!\" appeared.  However, when I try to launch this, I only get a message that says \"Could not send command to scanner.  Check the scanner's status\".  Now what?

There is just one stage missing to enable network access of the Epson scanner, to install iscan-network-nt.\nThe full recipe is as follows. For 32-bit machines the architecture labels will of course need changing to i386:\nsudo dpkg -i iscan-data_1.25.0-1_all.deb\nsudo dpkg -i iscan_2.29.3-1~usb0.1.ltdl7_amd64.deb\nsudo dpkg -i iscan-network-nt_1.1.1-1_amd64.deb\nsudo gedit /etc/sane.d/epkowa.conf\n\nThere are two entries to change in the epkowa.conf file, one for the network ip address (which you can get from the printer itself or from your router), and one to specify preference for the document feeder (although the latter seems to be brain-dead). After editing epkowa.conf it should contain the following lines somewhere:\nnet your.printer.ip.here\n...\noption prefer-adf\n\nNot only does this enable the Epson scanner software, it allows XSane and Simple Scan also to correctly locate and interact with the scanner.\n\nA: In Ubuntu, almost all the All-In-One printers does not need additional drivers to be installed. Drivers are automatically loaded by the following applications.\nYou can run the scanner with application Simple Scan \nAnd the Printer with application Printers\n", "Q: Setting Up Nfs Server I am a new student of Linux.

So the problem is the Radeon, but I can't keep it turned off all the time, it'd be a waste! Maybe it's because I haven't installed the drivers for the Radeon, but I can't install them while the radeon is disabled.\nHow can I fix this?\n\nA: Probably you can install the drivers even without the card enabled. \nIf you want to go with open source drivers, the correct packages is xserver-xorg-video-radeon (but you should have it installed by default). \nI had a lot of problems with my Intel + Radeon combo (it's a 7400m here, so maybe it doesn't apply to you). I put some consideration here: https://askubuntu.com/a/390050/16395 \nBasically, to go with the open-source drivers you just make sure you have the aforementioned package installed and make sure you do not have a /etc/X11/xorg.conf file. (If you have, backup it and try to remove it). \nTo go with the proprietary AMD drivers you can simply install them with \nsudo apt-get install fglrx fglrx-pxpress\n\nand then reboot. \nBe prepared to having to rescue the system if they do not work by entering again in recovery mode and uninstalling them --- remember to remove the xorg.conf file in this case; uninstalling the fglrx packages will not automatically remove it, and if present the open source drivers will not work.\nUseful question/answers: How do I get AMD/Intel Hybrid Graphics drivers to work? \n\nA: I use Lenovo G710 laptop. In the end it has proven to boot Ubuntu 13.10 properly, the only problem being that is does so with the screen turned off. If the problem is indeed the same as mine, then I believe G510 has analogous keyboard to G710, so you can turn the screen on simply using (Fn+)F9 or (Fn+)F12 keys.\n\nA: I have kubuntu 13.10 installed on my desktop, cpu Q8400 with Radeon HD5800 card. I have got the fglrx installed from the package manager which is ATI driver packaging version 13.10 since I wasn't able to get the latest 13.12 version downloaded from ATI website to work on kubuntu 13.10 (failed to compiled properly due to some software packages missing).My graphic card has both DVI (which I use a DVI to VGA converter) and a HDMI port. \nMy problem is same as yours, it give me a blank screen if I use the HDMI port to connect to my monitor. \nHowever, I found that if I connect to another monitor with the DVI port at the same time, all with be fine. Both the monitors will show cloned dual images. \nThis blank screen problem will persist even if I go to the ATI catalyst configuration and disabled the DVI monitor; as long as the DVI port is plugged in (even if it is disabled in the ATI config) the HDMI monitor will show desktop screen without problem. But when I removed the DVI port connection, the HDMI monitor will show a blank screen.\nBtw, if I purge the fglrx driver and used the default free ubuntu graphic driver this problem goes away. So, the graphic card has no problem. The problem lies with the ATI Radeon proprietary driver. However, I need the fglrx driver for the HDMI audio and the flash player to work properly. \nThus, now I am using my desktop by connecting to both monitors but with the second monitor(DVI) power off and disabled at the ATI config . Strange but it works for me. hahaha\nHope this help you. \n", "Q: Black screen when trying to install ubuntu 13.10 I am in need of some help.

This requires a switch of boot options in BIOS, which I'm OK with. So the behavior that I'm looking for is exactly this, in legacy mode, boot ubuntu, in UEFI mode, boot windows provided I make the BIOS switch at startup.\nHowever, after a series of installations and running boot-repair, which i've explained below, I can only boot ubuntu in the legacy mode and when I switch to UEFI mode, I go to grub rescue because it says \"no file found\". Now I can't boot into windows in any mode!\nThis is the sequence that caused this.\n-Windows 8 x64 preinstalled\n-Tried installing ubuntu in uefi, ran boot repair and this seemed to delete everything.\n-Reinstalled ubuntu in legacy mode, ran boot repair which doesn't work in the legacy mode\nNow only ubuntu in legacy mode works. There is no grub menu at all in the uefi mode.\nHere is the link to my boot info\nhttp://paste.ubuntu.com/6608333/\nHow can I add a boot menu in the uefi mode while still having my ubuntu running in legacy mode.\n\nA: Boot Repair has renamed the Windows boot loader file and put a copy of GRUB in its place. The Windows boot loader file should be EFI/Microsoft/Boot/bootmgfw.efi on the EFI System Partition (ESP), but Boot Repair has renamed it to bkpbootmgfw.efi and put GRUB in its place. You need to undo this damage. There's an option to do this on the Boot Repair Advanced menu page, or you can do it manually by renaming the file.\nIncidentally, you may want to check out my rEFInd boot manager. It starts up in EFI mode and can pass control to the Windows EFI boot loader. It can also pass control to a BIOS-mode boot loader such as GRUB, although you'll need to uncomment the scanfor line in refind.conf and ensure that hdbios is among the options. rEFInd can also boot Linux in EFI mode. It's not clear why you want to do a BIOS-mode boot of Linux, but IMHO it's usually better to do an EFI-mode boot unless you've got some specific problem with that (like a video card that's not working well in EFI mode).\n", "Q: How can I get communication with my Arduino Uno over the serial port to work?

The last two trys caused a systemcrash. \nCan someone please tell me what dependencies are required for the programm to compile...\nThanks in advance\nBTW if it helps I get this error: \nconfigure: error: * pkg-config not found. See http://www.freedesktop.org/software/pkgconfig/\nUPDATE: I found pkg-config. You can install it by using the synaptics package manager. But now it's asking for glib-2.0...which is not listed there...at least not under this exact name.\nI've found this thread where someone installed libperl-dev & libgtk2.0-dev (http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=1607632) and it kinda worked for him. I'm trying that now. I going to give feedback on how it worked for me.\nBTW: Thanks for all the replies ;-)\nAnother UPDATE: So here I am again. BTW libperl-dev & libgtk2.0-dev somehow managed to get the compiling process moving. But only a few lines further :-(. Now, and here is where I've ruined my previous ubuntu installations, it says:\nchecking for DBUSGLIB1... no\nconfigure: error: Package requirements (dbus-glib-1 >= 0.92) were not met:\nNo package 'dbus-glib-1' found\nConsider adjusting the PKG_CONFIG_PATH environment variable if you\ninstalled software in a non-standard prefix.\nThe first 3 lines kinda make sense. It was looking for a certain package, namely dbus-glib-1 , but couldn't find it in my system. \nThe weird thing here is: I can't find this one either. I've look almost everywhere. A web search refers me to the package libdbus-glib-1-2 (http://packages.debian.org/wheezy/libdbus-glib-1-2) but that one is already installed. \nI'm afraid I have to consider figuring out what the second part means. I have to be honest here: I have no idea what i could possibly mean.\nCould anyone please give me some sort of hint where to start looking.\n\nA: pkg-config is telling you that it cannot find a file named dbus-glib-1.pc so if you already installed dbus-glib-1-2, that means that you'll have to tell pkg-config where it is via the PKG_CONFIG_PATH environment variable.  You can try the following:\nStart by opening a terminal (CTRL+ALT+T) and typing the command\nlocate dbus-glib-1.pc\n\nIt should tell you where that file is.  On mine it says /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/pkgconfig/dbus-glib-1.pc  Next type export PKG_CONFIG_PATH=/usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/pkgconfig:$PKG_CONFIG_PATH (or whatever path your locate command output was) making sure to leave off /dbus-glib-1.pc from the end of the locate output.  pkg-config should now be able to find dbus-glib. \nIf the locate command doesn't output anything, then dbus-glib is not installed and you'll have to install it using the command sudo apt-get install libdbus-glib-1-2.  Depending on which version of Ubuntu you're running, you might have to type apt-cache search dbus-glib-1 and then sudo apt-get install a different version than 1-2.  Be sure to avoid the packages that have -dbg , -dev , or -doc at the end of the title.  Those aren't the ones you want.\nGood luck.\n\nA: The problem you had is that the core package dbus-glib-1 was installed (the library itself) but not the development package dbus-glib-1-dev (which contains things to compile against the library, for example the header files).\nYou should install dbus-glib-1-dev.\nBTW as of today you can try a new release of infinity-plugin. It depends on less libraries than the one you tried (no dbus, no gtk+) so it's easier to compile.\nIn Ubuntu you install all the deps with the command:\nsudo apt -y install pkg-config audacious-dev libsdl2-dev libglib2.0-dev\n\nRegards.\n", "Q: where do I get the Eclipse CDT I have Ubuntu 13.10 and Eclipse 3.8 from the Ubuntu Software Center.

If the Eclipse web site does provide a compatible CDT, I could not find it.\n\nA: If you don't have any specific requirements that force you to use Eclipse 3.8, I suggest that you get a never version of Eclipse.

Gparted(the software which helps you create partitions) will show both the devices(internal as well as external hard-disk. It may even show other storage devices connected, if any).\n\n*On the bottom part of the partition creation process, you will be given an option to choose where to load the boot-loader.

If you are in doubt that your partition table is in a healthy state, then you can create a new partition table. Simply speaking the partition table defines where current filesystems lie. A filesystem in turn is a protocol for communicating with the harddrive's storage units (called blocks).\nBy default every newly created filesystem will assume the space it gets assinged to be empty and will overwrite these blocks, not careing about previously existing data or what protocol/filesystem was used previously.\nSo creating new filesystems that overwrite old data is enough to deal with malware on your harddrive.\n\nDont install any Windows compatibility software in Linux, if you want to be safe from Windows malware on Linux.\n", "Q: Trouble ssh-ing into router I am trying to access my router from the terminal and I keep getting an error.

I've connected a PC running Ubuntu 12.04 with XBMC installed. I am looking to get it replaced with a Raspberry Pi for the power-usage benefits and smaller footprint. I would like to have a single media center that I can use to not only manage my media (XBMC does a great job of that), but that I can also use to stream video to other Android devices in the house, over wifi. Does anybody have a How-To doc on this for a solution I could follow? Thanks.\n\nA: I have a Raspberry Pi loaded with Raspbmc as a lightweight HTPC, at which it does an okay job. I would not recommend attempting to use it as media server: it doesn't have enough CPU horsepower to handle serving media to multiple channels. Adding media storage capacity to a Pi means going through an external USB2 hard drive which will become another bottleneck trying to serve multiple HD video streams. The wifi support on the Pi's is also not robust as you will have to use some type of USB wifi dongle. Read through the questions here on AU and see how many issues people have with those devices on standard i386 and amd64 kernels; the situation is worse with the ARM kernel.\nI already had a server running Ubuntu that I installed MythTV on to act as a PVR in conjunction with a SiliconDust HomeRun cable box. The side benefit is that MythTV can also serve other media via DLNA. Adding MythTV as a media source in XBMC is relatively easy.\nIf you have other hardware that you wish to repurpose to act as a media server, I would look at Plex Media Server. Good Linux, Mac and Windows support. It does have a fairly high hardware requirement for running on, but one that should work on a box built within the past four years. The same would apply for running Mythbuntu, an Ubuntu-based distro for MythTV.\nIf you're starting from scratch, I'd suggest looking at NAS units that also have DLNA servers built in to them and pair that with a Atom-based HTPC box on which you can install a Linux/XBMC combo. Even modest NAS units like the WD MyCloud have DLNA servers built-in that are capable of serving out to multiple devices including iOS and Android. (I have a 2TB WD unit joined to my system.) An Atom-based HTPC box has a small footprint, modest power requirements and enough CPU power to run a fronted like XBMC very well.\nExplore your options. Google is your friend. Look at what you're trying to achieve, what you have to work with, how much you're willing to spend and how much time you want to invest getting things running.\n\nA: DISCLAIMER: I HAVE NO EXPERIENCE IN RASPBERRY PI, SO I CAN'T GUARANTEE THAT THIS WILL WORK.\nI can highly recommend using this guide from the xbmc wiki: http://wiki.xbmc.org/index.php?title=HOW-TO:Share_libraries_using_MySQL\n\nIf you have more than one XBMC device on your local network then you might want to synchronize them using a MySQL library. Using a MySQL library allows you to store information about your whole video library in a central database, sfewo that multiple XBMC devices can access the same information at the same time.\nThis gives you the ability to do things like:\nShare watched and unwatched status for your media on all devices\n      Stop watching a movie or TV show in one room then finish watching it in another room automatically\n      Only one library to maintain for all devices\n\nI use this myself at home at it works really well. I installed the xbmc android app on my phone and tablet and I have no complaints with using it over wifi.  The best part is that I can start a film in the lounge and then resume it on my phone somewhere else. \nThe only thing that you will have to do is find a pc to run a mysql server. \n", "Q: I can't add any ppa I don't know why but after a while I can't add any working ppa any more!

One monitor (DisplayPort-0) for work and one TV (HDMI-0) for movies. Xrandr says both connected, but I configured screen/desktop just to monitor, because I don't want any window to stray to TV. On TV I want only video output.\nIs there any media player, utility program or any command line tool, that will allow me send video output to TV, means send it to display, that is connected but out of screen?\nI use Radeon driver and GPU Radeon HD6xxx family. I totally lack experience here so thanks for any advice.\nedit: Oh, and I run elementary OS based on Ubuntu 12.04\nedit-1: There seems to be common solution for this by setting two separate screens, one for each display. In the past, one would fiddle with xorg.conf. These days, people achieve that through AMD proprietary driver. I'll try both way and will post my results here.\n\nA: OK, done, but next time will someone tell me, that configuring X.server is fun, I'll punch him right in the middle of his eyes.\nAnyway, the solution, that leads me to success, include AMD proprietary driver and VLC player.\n\n\n*\n\n*firstly, install AMD proprietary driver. Thanks to this thread I used somehow cleaner and should-be-safe procedure with installation code (recommended even if you have already fglrx installed, but experiencing troubles):\nsudo apt-get --purge remove fglrx*\nsudo apt-get install fglrx-updates fglrx-amdcccle-updates\n\n\n*now you can configure your setup with\nsudo amdcccle\n\nit'll open  C atalyst C ontrol C enter\n\n*In CCC you configure your displays as 'desktop with one display' or something like that. I don't know exact english phrase, because I use translated GUI. Anyway, it should configure your displays as separate screen.\n\n*now restart computer (or X). My computer behave strangely after boot, it needs one suspend & resume to work properly. Don't ask me why, but if you experienced abnormally laud GPU fan, you have probably the same problem and suspend & resume is one way around. For piece in mind, run CCC again and check your settings.\n\n*now to the media player. If you don't have VLC yet, install it via App Center. Then open VLC, go to Tools->Setting and\nNOTE: solution described here makes all VLC settings permanent, which makes VLC one-purpose player only for video on secondary display. If you want use VLC for other purposes, you should run VLC with this settings set from command line, read VLC command line help\n\n\n*\n\n*on the first panel 'Interface' uncheck 'embeed video in interface' and uncheck 'Show controls in fullscreen'\n(again, phrases may vary, because I have localized GUI in VLC too, thats one good thing about linux -> it localize all your apps by default).\n\n*then go to Video tab and check 'Play in fullscreen' and set video output to\nVideo output X11(XCB)\n\n\n*then turn to advanced/all (?) setting via radio button near left bottom corner.\n\n\n*\n\n*In tree structure navigate to video and there set 'video width' and 'video height' to your secondary screen resolution. Without this, VLC plays video on my secondary screen in resolution of source, not scaled to fullscreen.\n\n*Then expand video->modules->x-window and set it to your desired X screen. Mine (and most probably yours) is\n:0.1\n\nInitials :0 means local display and following .1 targets secondary screen. Primary display/screen is :0.0. You can find your configured x screens and their numbers in\n/etc/X11/xorg.conf\n\n\n\n\n*then should be all set. You can try play video with VLC and it should open on your secondary display fullscreen, while keeping VLC control interface on your primary screen. Only audio is played from your PC speakers/headphones. That we solve in VLC control interface under Audio->Audio devices, where we choose HDMI output. Then you hit Ctrl+L to switch VLC interface into playlist view and you have all your media fully under control.\nThis procedure describe in short, what leads me to success. In your case, it shall not be as straightforward, because of LINUX. But if you don't understand something or have any problem, just ask.\nEDIT: Switch back to radeon driver\nI had strange problems with fglrx driver and xorg.conf generated by amdcccle looked pretty normal, so I tried, if it'll work with open-source radeon driver and guess what, it works! Just need a little modification (basically, just replace driver \"fglrx\" to driver \"radeon\", beware that there are multiple device sections).\nMy working xorg.conf looks like this:\nSection \"ServerLayout\"\nIdentifier     \"aticonfig Layout\"\nScreen      0  \"aticonfig-Screen[0]-0\" 0 0\nScreen         \"amdcccle-Screen[1]-1\" 2560 0\nEndSection\n\nSection \"Monitor\"\nIdentifier   \"aticonfig-Monitor[0]-0\"\nOption      \"VendorName\" \"ATI Proprietary Driver\"\nOption      \"ModelName\" \"Generic Autodetecting Monitor\"\nOption      \"DPMS\" \"true\"\nEndSection\n\nSection \"Monitor\"\nIdentifier   \"0-DFP1\"\nOption      \"VendorName\" \"ATI Proprietary Driver\"\nOption      \"ModelName\" \"Generic Autodetecting Monitor\"\nOption      \"DPMS\" \"true\"\nOption      \"PreferredMode\" \"2560x1440\"\nOption      \"TargetRefresh\" \"60\"\nOption      \"Position\" \"0 0\"\nOption      \"Rotate\" \"normal\"\nOption      \"Disable\" \"false\"\nEndSection\n\nSection \"Monitor\"\nIdentifier   \"0-DFP5\"\nOption      \"VendorName\" \"ATI Proprietary Driver\"\nOption      \"ModelName\" \"Generic Autodetecting Monitor\"\nOption      \"DPMS\" \"true\"\nOption      \"PreferredMode\" \"1920x1080\"\nOption      \"TargetRefresh\" \"50\"\nOption      \"Position\" \"0 0\"\nOption      \"Rotate\" \"normal\"\nOption      \"Disable\" \"false\"\nEndSection\n\nSection \"Device\"\nIdentifier  \"aticonfig-Device[0]-0\"\nDriver      \"radeon\"\nOption      \"Monitor-DFP1\" \"0-DFP1\"\nBusID       \"PCI:1:0:0\"\nEndSection\n\nSection \"Device\"\nIdentifier  \"amdcccle-Device[1]-1\"\nDriver      \"radeon\"\nOption      \"Monitor-DFP5\" \"0-DFP5\"\nBusID       \"PCI:1:0:0\"\nScreen      1\nEndSection\n\nSection \"Screen\"\nIdentifier \"Default Screen\"\nDefaultDepth     24\nEndSection\n\nSection \"Screen\"\nIdentifier \"aticonfig-Screen[0]-0\"\nDevice     \"aticonfig-Device[0]-0\"\nDefaultDepth     24\nSubSection \"Display\"\n    Viewport   0 0\n    Depth     24\nEndSubSection\nEndSection\n\nSection \"Screen\"\nIdentifier \"amdcccle-Screen[1]-1\"\nDevice     \"amdcccle-Device[1]-1\"\nDefaultDepth     24\nSubSection \"Display\"\n    Viewport   0 0\n    Depth     24\nEndSubSection\nEndSection\n\nYou should backup your xorg.conf before uninstall fglrx, because it is removed during uninstallation process. Then you uninstall fglrx and reconfigure x-server like this:\nsudo apt-get remove --purge xorg-driver-fglrx fglrx*\nsudo apt-get install --reinstall libgl1-mesa-glx libgl1-mesa-dri xserver-xorg-core\nsudo dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg\n\nThen put back your modified xorg.conf and restart computer (or X). If nothing went wrong, you should see your separate screen config load under radeon driver. Only issue is missin HDMI audio, which you can solve by adding kernel parameter\nradeon.audio=1\n\nmore useful informations can be obtained in documentation.\n", "Q: How to remove linux capabilities? One useful attribute for protecting log files is append-only. When this attribute is set, the file cannot be deleted, and writes are only allowed to append to the end of the file.\nObviously, an intruder who has gained root privileges could realize that file attributes are being used and just remove the append-only flag from the logs by running chattr -a. To prevent this,we’ll need to disable the ability to remove the append-only attribute. To accomplish this under Linux, use its capabilities mechanism. \nTo prevent a user from removing the append-only attribute from a file, we need to remove the CAP_LINUX_IMMUTABLE capability.\nHow to remove this capability?\nlcap utility was previously used for this purpose, but it is currently not available for ubuntu. Is there any other way to remove linux kernel capabilities?\nRecounting: I success to install lcap_0.0.6 in ubuntu server 13.04 but after run the following command I get an error message:\nsudo ./lcap CAP_LINUX_IMMUTABE\n/proc/sys/kernel/cap-bound: No such file or directory\n\n\nA: Not a a complete answer, but this may help understand what's going on.\nFrom http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man7/capabilities.7.html:\n\nCapability bounding set prior to Linux 2.6.25\nIn kernels before 2.6.25, the capability bounding set is a system-\n  wide attribute that affects all threads on the system.  The bounding\n  set is accessible via the file /proc/sys/kernel/cap-bound.\n...\nCapability bounding set from Linux 2.6.25 onward\nFrom Linux 2.6.25, the capability bounding set is a per-thread\n  attribute.  (There is no longer a system-wide capability bounding\n  set.)\n...\nRemoving capabilities from the bounding set is supported only if file\n  capabilities are compiled into the kernel.  In kernels before Linux\n  2.6.33, file capabilities were an optional feature configurable via\n  the CONFIG_SECURITY_FILE_CAPABILITIES option.  Since Linux 2.6.33,\n  the configuration option has been removed and file capabilities are\n  always part of the kernel.  When file capabilities are compiled into\n  the kernel, the init process (the ancestor of all processes) begins\n  with a full bounding set.  If file capabilities are not compiled into\n  the kernel, then init begins with a full bounding set minus\n  CAP_SETPCAP, because this capability has a different meaning when\n  there are no file capabilities.\nRemoving a capability from the bounding set does not remove it from\n  the thread's inherited set.  However it does prevent the capability\n  from being added back into the thread's inherited set in the future.\n\n", "Q: Building nginx on Ubuntu with cache_purge module - help?

Currently I am running windows 8. Windows is installed on the 128 GB SSD (C drive) and I use the 1 TB drive for data storage (movies, pictures, musis, documents...). This is the D drive. Would it be possible for me to install ubuntu on the C drive and keep using D as my data drive? I don't have enough space to make a backup of my files. What are my options to install ubuntu without losing the files on the D drive? Thanks in advance.\n\nA: First:\n\nI don't have enough space to make a backup of my files.\n\nCorrect this problem! I've seen too many people who post here or elsewhere with sob stories about how they've lost all their data because they tried X, Y, or Z and it had unintended consequences, or because their hardware failed. These things do happen, and by and large, they happen suddenly and unpredictably. So keep backups!\nThat said, you can certainly install Ubuntu on the SSD, either instead of or in addition to Windows, and retain access to files on your 1TB disk. (Under Linux, the designations \"C: drive\" and \"D: drive\" are meaningless. Even under Windows, these terms refer to filesystems, which don't necessarily correspond with physical disks in a 1:1 manner.)\nIf you intend to replace Windows, though, I strongly recommend converting your data disk from NTFS (which it probably uses now) to a Linux-native filesystem. This action will require either a multi-stage process of moving file and resizing partitions or a backup-and-restore operation. As resizing partitions is particularly risky, a backup is highly recommended for the former procedure, at which point you might as well just do a backup-and-restore. Anyhow, although Linux can read and write NTFS, performance will suffer, the disk will lack Linux filesystem features you might need, and Linux lacks any sort of NTFS repair tools. Thus my recommendation to switch from NTFS to a Linux-native filesystem. If Windows will remain on the computer, though, the last of these issues becomes much less important under Linux, and the first two issues favor NTFS under Windows. In a Linux/Windows multi-boot scenario, FAT is the most compatible filesystem; but it's got file-size limits that make it impractical for many purposes. NTFS is the second-best choice (or the best choice if FAT's file-size limits are a serious problem).\n", "Q: no menu in dogecoin-qt wallet client As you can see, there is no menu on the top menu bar.

Am I missing something... how long does the password have to be.\nI have to get these up and running for xmas eve and am panicking now.  \n\nA: You’ll want to boot from your Ubuntu Live CD, choosing “Try Ubuntu without any change to your computer” from the boot menu.\nOnce the system boots, open up a new Terminal window from Applications \\ Accessories and then type in the following command:\nsudo fdisk -l\n\nThis command is used to tell what device name the hard drive is using, \"The entry with * before\"\nI assume its sda1 for the rest\nNow you’ll need to create a directory to mount the hard drive on. Since we’re actually booting off the live cd, the directory doesn’t really get created anywhere.\nsudo mkdir /media/sda1\n\nThe next command will mount the hard drive in the /media/sda1 folder.\nsudo mount /dev/sda1 /media/sda1\n\nNow it’s time for the command that actually does the magic: chroot. This command is used to open up a shell with a different root directory than the current shell is using, and we’ll pass in the folder where we mounted the hard drive.\nsudo chroot /media/sda1\n\nNow you should be able to use the passwd command to change your user account’s password, and it will be applied to the hard drive since we are using chroot.\npasswd USERNAME\n\nNote that you’ll have to type your username after the passwd command in order to change the right password.\nNow you should be able to reboot your system and log yourself in with your new password.\n\nA: I had exactly the same problem. The resolution is explained here: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/LostPassword.\nIn case the link dies, the problem seems to be a lack of write access which you need to change your password. The solution is simply to type\nmount -rw -o remount / \n\nDo this step immediately before the passwd username step. This worked for me.\n", "Q: doesn't work automation autostart command for conky I added conky configuration to my autostart application.\nBut this doesn't work after I restarted PC.\nHere is how looks configuration at setting manager:\n\nHere is content of .ConkyWizardLaunch file:\n\nsleep 8 && conky -c ~/.ConkyWizardTheme/ConkyWizardTheme\n\nAnother linked file contains exactly conky configuration with looking themas.\nIt should repaint view every 8 sec.\nUnfortunately this doesn't work at start.

I just reinstalled Ubuntu 12.04 (LTS) 24 hours after I first installed it. I really screwed up the initial install when I tried to update the Nvidia driver from 3.04 to 3.19. (I have an Nvidia GT220)\nFirst time I installed the update from the icon in the top that said new updates were available. When the computer restarted it hanged on boot with a message: \"starting load fallback graphics devices fail\". I tried a couple things I found on the Ubuntu forums and the commands either didn't work or it completely messed up my install due to me just imputing any command I found online. So I ended up doing a complete reinstall.\nNow I have the fresh install....I get the same pop-up about a driver update but I haven't touched it. Do I click on the update? Download directly from Nvidia? Or do it from the terminal? A step-by-step would be much appreciated. Also if I get the same error, how do I fix it? Please explain what I need to do, while I am familiar with the workings of DOS/Windows, I have no idea what I am doing in Linux (no idea what the xorg file is, how to change directories in the terminal or anything)\nTHANKS!!!!!!!\n\nA: If the Nvidia 319 driver caused issues, then don't install it again. Use the Nvidia 304 driver instead.\nThe recommended way to install it is either from the Additional Drivers application (12.04), or Software & Updates application under 'additional drivers' tab.\nThe easiest way to fix a broken driver is to uninstall it, but that will require knowledge of terminal commands at least. sudo apt-get remove nvidia* is the terminal command to uninstall Nvidia driver. If you can't get to a desktop, you have to boot to a root command prompt, mount your file system, then run that command. Press shift right when Ubuntu starts, then select root command prompt. Then run mount -o rw,remount /. Then run sudo apt-get remove nvidia*. Then restart the computer.\n", "Q: Is there a pdf reader that displays animations?

We want the default\n  settings so when asked to enter a file in which to save the key, just\n  press enter.\n$ ssh-keygen -t rsa -C \"your_email@example.com\"\n# Creates a new ssh key, using the provided email as a label\n# Generating public/private rsa key pair.\n# Enter file in which to save the key (/home/you/.ssh/id_rsa):\n$ ssh-add id_rsa\n\n\nThe command ssh-keygen -t rsa -C you@example.com creates a new RSA key file with the text you@example.com in the comment section. When the command is invoked, you are asked to supply the file name. Pressing Enter in this case will use the default (/home/you/.ssh/id_rsa).\nThe command thereafter (ssh-add id_rsa) adds the key file to the SSH agent daemon such that you only have to enter the password once a session. (see the manual pages of ssh-add and ssh-agent).\nTo \"recover\" from this mistake, you can either remove the files ssh-add id_rsa and ssh-add id_rsa.pub and start over or rename it:\nmv ~/.ssh/ssh-add\\ id_rsa ~/.ssh/id_rsa\nmv ~/.ssh/ssh-add\\ id_rsa.pub ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub\n\n\nA: The tutorial is badly written:\nIt says:\n\nWe want the default settings so when asked to enter a file in which to save the key, just press enter.\n\nBut in the output is shows:\nEnter file in which to save the key (/home/you/.ssh/id_rsa):\n$ ssh-add id_rsa\n\nHow that ssh-add id_rsa command gotten in the output I don't know. When it asks for the name of the file, just press ENTER, as it is written in the tutorial. Ignore that $ ssh-add id_rsa thing in the output, that shouldn't be there.\n\nA: You have files named \"ssh-add id_rsa\" and \"ssh-add id_rsa.pub\". You did something wrong. Remove those files and retry the whole procedure.\nOr just use github-keygen for your SSH setup. Easy and secure.

I would like to have a good suggestion on Disk Partitioning and other configuration to run it smoothly.\nI am using Lenovo G570 laptop with 8gig of ram, Intel® Core™ i3-2350M CPU @ 2.30GHz × 4, Intel® Sandybridge Mobile. Radeom Graphics and 500 gigs of HD. I have downloaded ubuntu-12.04.3-desktop-amd64.iso and ready to put it to my pen driver to start re-installing.\nI am more concerned about the performance and stability. \n\nA: this is what I'll do\nmake two partitions, one to store data and other for Ubuntu as you have 500 gig make 400 gig for data and leave 100 gig unpartitioned \nnow start installation and choose to install it in unpartisioned space.  Ubuntu will select the recommended partition format depending on your hardware  The above one is simple but if you want to manually partition then make a partition home folder, one for swap(9gig) and one for the system\n\nA: http://lifehacker.com/5403100/dual+boot-windows-7-and-ubuntu-in-perfect-harmony. this might help u decide. better to create 3 partitions.one for windows. one for ur general data and one for ubuntu. split the ubuntu partiton into 2. one for swap equal to ur ram and the rest for ur install.\n", "Q: Cannot access BIOS after shifting to Legacy mode (Lenovo E330) I shifted Windows 8 based laptop to boot in Bios Legacy mode just to be able to use a USB Key with a 32 bits Ubuntu saucy on it. Worked fine. I tried an install on a fresh GPT partition and it worked fine. However...\nNow I cannot access the BIOS anymore. The F1 or Enter key (that are supposed to lead me to BIOS setup, or to interrupt the standard boot respectively) just... do nothing. Ubuntu  (32 bits) boots up immediately.\nIs there any way to reenter the BIOS. I would like to do a clean UEI based 64 bits install now or even access Windows 8. But I cannot even turn back the boot to UEFI mode :-(\nSeveral people seems to have the same issue and even clering the CMOS (by removing the internal RTC backup battery) does not help. It just clears the RTC, the BIOS is using non volatile memory.\n\nA: I've heard of this problem, but I've never experienced it myself. In the case I heard of, the cause seemed to be that the firmware was using an entry in its boot manager to activate the ability to enter the firmware setup tool. The boot manager list is stored in NVRAM and is manipulated by tools like Linux's efibootmgr, an EFI shell's bcfg, or even the firmware's built-in user interface. When that list was modified in certain ways, the entry to access the firmware user interface went away. IIRC, the person who had this problem was able to restore the thing by resetting the NVRAM -- but you say you've tried that to no avail. Still, it might be worth trying again.\nYou might try unplugging all your disk devices and booting the computer. With any luck, this will cause the firmware to enter its setup utility, and if you're very lucky, that option will remain accessible when you reboot with your disks attached.\nAnother option might be to use a tool, such as gummiboot or my rEFInd, that includes an option to reboot the computer into its setup utility. There are USB flash drive and CD-R images of rEFInd that should be easy to test. Unfortunately, not all EFIs provide this feature, so if yours doesn't, this obviously won't work. You'll also need a way to test rEFInd. This is easy enough if you can get to your boot manager menu, but if your firmware is really badly inaccessible, you might need to install the tool on your hard disk to get anywhere, and that's both more hassle and more risk.\nIf all of this fails, return the computer; this type of problem constitutes a design defect, IMHO.\n", "Q: OK to have XP and Ubuntu? With XP support ending in April 2014 it is worth creating a Ubuntu dual partition or am I better off just replacing XP with Ubuntu?\n\nA: Try Ubuntu without installing it on your hard-disk using Ubuntu live disk.From that you can understand which one is better whether to dualboot Windows and Ubuntu or replacing Windows with Ubuntu.\n\nA: I recommend using wine in Ubuntu and just ditch XP all together. If you end up hating Ubuntu there are many other options as well (Mint Kubuntu Debian Fedora Xubuntu and so on).\n\nA: You shouldn't use XP from a computer with internet access after Microsoft finishes with patching the security holes in it. And this is unrelated to the thing whether you switch to Ubuntu or to anything else. \nIf you still have to use XP for compatibility with some programs I advise you to disable the network interface in XP and do your networking stuff from another, still supported OS, be it either another version of Windows, Linux, or anything else.\n", "Q: I just installed Ubuntu Restricted. How to use java? I just installed the Ubuntu Restricted Extras. I want to code using java. How do I open the installed Extras and use java. When I type \"java\" in Dash home, I get many results.\nThank you. \n\nA: Well the restricted extras doesn't give Oracle's JDK for some reason. (Not for me anyway) There are many tutorials on how to install java. Many are convoluted and have you use extra steps that really are not needed. But here is how I install Oracle's JDK.\nFirst type in the terminal:\nsudo apt-get purge openjdk* \n\nTo get rid of openjdk if it is there.\nThen download a nifty .rpm to .deb converter called alien\nsudo apt-get install alien\n\nDownload Oracle's JRE or JDK .rpm file. \nThen run \nsudo alien jdk-7u45-linux-x64.rpm --scripts\n\nif the .rpm name is different replace mine with the correct one. Alien will convert the .rpm to a .deb The --scripts prefix is important, do not leave it out or it will not convert the .rpm.\nRun the .deb\nNow you have Oracle's JDK. Don't install Eclipse from the Ubuntu Software Center. For some reason the Software Center installs OpenJDK and replaces it with the Oracle one. The update alternatives doesn't point to the directory Oracle's JDK is installed in. Your best bet to run Eclipse is to download the .zip file and unpackage it somewhere. \nThe draw back is you have to run jars in the terminal. Not really a drawback from my perspective, but some people want to just double click. I find though that using the terminal actually shows what is kind of going on and it helps with finding bugs easier.\n\nA: If you just want to write a program you should be totally fine with OpenJDK  from the Ubuntu repositories.\nIf you really need Oracle JDK, you can add ppa:webupd8team/java and install oracle-java7-installer.\n", "Q: Downgraded from Windows 8, and can't get ubuntu installed I got a laptop with Windows 8 pre-installed and I hated it.

This puzzled me because I'd seen it work without the user on another machine. Just want to add that it is required because it is a system job.

Okay here is my issue. Every time I install a .deb installer of a program that requires java. OpenJDK hijacks my system and sets it as default Java.

I don't want to have to do this, or switch from OpenJDK to Oracle's official JDK. It is time wasting.

Within a directory upon which the sticky bit is applied, users are prevented from deleting or renaming any files that they do not personally own.\" \nDoes this mean if I run the following:\n// only allow other users to read files in /directory\nsudo chmod o-w -R /directory\nsudo chmod o-x -R /directory\nsudo chmod o+r -R /directory\n\nusers can still delete or rename any file that does not belong to them?\n\nA: The sticky bit is useful on directories that are world-writable, such as /tmp. In these directories, anyone can create a file, so the directory needs to be world-writable. But that would mean anyone could delete a file, too, even if it didn't belong to them, since deleting a file is controlled by the write permission on the directory. When a directory has the sticky bit, only the owner of a file has the permission to delete it.\nIn a directory with permissions rwx------ or rwxr-xr-x, only the owner of the directory can create or delete a file. If there are any files that belong to a different user (moved there by root, or created when the directory had more open permissions), it's still the owner of the directory who has permissions to delete them, not the owner of the file.\nIn a directory with permissions rwxrwx---, all members of the group can create and delete files. Any member of the group can delete any file even if it belongs to a different user. If the permissions are rwxrwx--T instead (capital T is like t, but t means that the x bit is set and T means that the x bit is clear), then any member of the group can create a file, and members of the group can delete files but only their own files.\nYou can use the following command to see which directories have the sticky bit on your system:\nfind / /run /run/lock /run/shm -xdev -path /usr -prune -o -perm -o+t -ls 2>/dev/null\n\nYou'll find some directories like /tmp which are open to everyone, and some directories like /var/spool/cron/crontabs which are reserved for a system program that runs as its own group (setgid), where the sticky bit ensures that the program can only delete files on behalf of the user who owns them (what ensures that the program can only create files on behalf of the user who owns them is that the program is running as that user, not as root, so cannot create files belonging to other users).\n", "Q: Kubuntu's TTY resolution too low after installing nvidia-current After installing Kubuntu on a Notebook with GeForce Go 6100 graphics card, the tty's were working correctly, but the KDE desktop wouldn't display anything correctly.

I am just starting to explore about launchpad package upload, .deb packaging and GPG keys. \nOne thing that bothers me is that why do I have to upload/push my gpg key to ubuntu's keyserver before using launchpad ?\n\nA: Ubuntu's (Debian) APT package management verifies package integrity by using GnuPG, a PGP implementation. For distributing keys, the regular public PGP keyservers are used. Any public key can be uploaded there for anyone to retrieve. By comparing the fingerprints on the key(s) you mention on Launchpad and the ones on the packages everyone including Launchpad itself can verify the software is indeed uploaded by you and hasn't change since it left your machine.\nUbuntu's key servers are synchronized with other Open PGP key servers.\nI don't see why you would need to be uncomfortable uploading your key as it's just the public key (of course). If you don't want to share your real name, just create a second key with another name and use that one for Launchpad/debuild.\n", "Q: Console streaming client for icecast I need a console streaming client for icecast which allows me to use dynamic playlists and can play mp3.\nIces2 support dynamic playlists but it plays ogg only, it does not support mp3 files.\n\nA: The only client that comes to mind is Ices0 the predecessor of Ices2. \nUnfortunately Ices0 was deprecated at version 0.4. After Medibuntu also stopped their service there is no repository and there may be no DEBIAN package available for Ices0. You will have to compile from source.\nBecause of it's deprecated state there will be no way to predict it's behaviour with future  releases of Icecast2. I could not test on a present release but I was able to run Ices0 fine in previous version on Ubuntu 12.04 and earlier.\nIces0 source comes with a good documentation, and we are quite versatile with palylists, as it supports playlist handling via custom Perl or Python plugins.\n", "Q: Blender closes alone in ubuntu 13:10 I installed Blender 2.69 via ppa in ubuntu saucy salamander using a ppa\nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:irie/blender\n\nBut it closes randomly when I am using it.

This is not about calculating typing speed, but I need to calculate the length of the texts in \"norm pages\".\nThese \"keystrokes\" differ from normal character count in that uppercase letters are counted as two keystrokes, and so are all characters that require shift to be produced on a standard keyboard layout (space, tab, enter/eol count as one keystroke as well).\nBefore writing a script on my own: is there anything like \"wc --keystroke\" around?\n\nA: No, but essentially what you want is a keylogger and based on the text file it creates to store what is logged you can count the letters in the log. But...it probably will register capital letters as 1 key. See How can I install a keylogger software? for examples. Log the strokes and then do these examples to count them\n", "Q: Can't connect to certain sites I've been having an odd issue for months (8-12?) now, and I'm out of ideas.

I like the concept of having a guest account on the computer, but one thing I would like to know is, if the guest account is customizable? Particularly the language input settings? \n\nA: Please see the tutorial Customize Guest Session. As regards language input, the line\necho 'setxkbmap se,us' >> $HOME/.profile\n\nin /etc/guest-session/prefs.sh is an example of how the keyboard layout for the guest sessions may be specified.\nEdit:\nFrom your comment I understand that you need to use e.g. IBus. I'm pretty sure it can be done, but I'm on 13.10 now, where the input method configuration works differently, so I can't easily figure out the details.\nWhat's most important, I suppose, is to make sure that IBus is started automatically when you launch a guest session, so that the IBus icon shows up on the menu bar. That should be the case if Chinese is your system wide display language.\nEdit II:\nAssuming that your system default display language is en_US, you may want to try these steps:\n\n\n*\n\n*Create the folder /etc/guest-session\n\n*Create the file /etc/guest-session/prefs.sh and give it the following contents:\n\n\n# start the IBus daemon automatically\nmkdir -p $HOME/.xinput.d\nln -s /etc/X11/xinit/xinput.d/ibus $HOME/.xinput.d/en_US\nchown -R $USER:$USER $HOME/.xinput.d\n\nHopefully that will make the IBus icon show up on the menu bar when you launch a guest session.\nEdit III:\nI have just rewritten the previously mentioned tutorial. With the new approach to customizing the guest session feature, this question (and many similar questions) are answered much more easily than before.\nSo a version neutral answer to this question may now be:\n\n\n*\n\n*Create a special purpose user in accordance with the tutorial.\n\n*When logged in to the special user account, change the input method settings (and possibly the keyboard layout settings too) to your liking.\n\n*Done.\n\n\nI tested this successfully on Ubuntu 14.04, and I believe the chances are good that it works fine on 12.04 as well.\n", "Q: Infinality problem with fonts in firefox Just installed infinality in 13.10 from ppa:no1wantdthisname/ppa.

The search interface of Ubuntu search has a strong transparency. However, if there is any window open on the current workspace, the Ubuntu search interface is pretty hard to use read, because the applications below shine through. \nHow can I change the appearance of Ubuntu search and remove this annoying transparency? Unity tweak tool does not seem to have an setting for that.\nAny hint is much appreciated.\n\nA: Solution is Compiz CCSM. In section \"workspace\" there's a menu item \"Ubuntu Unity Plugin\". There you will find the option \"Background color\", which refers to the background of the \"Dash\". That's what the search interface seems to be called actually. Use this background color option to set color and transparency of the dash's background. What a relieve to finally stop being distracted by the blurry stuff from underneath this dash panel...\n\nA: I know this is a bit old now, but starting with Ubuntu 15.10 (I believe), you can turn off transparency in CCSM -> Unity and choose force low graphics mode. I am hoping this would get put into Appearance in Unity Control Center.  As it comes in handy, I don't want to dig through CCSM.\n\nA: In 15.10, there is no \"workspace\". If you search for \"workspace\", you get \"Workspace Naming\".\nThere is also no CCSM->Unity.\nThere IS a category Desktop, with \"Ubuntu Unity Plugin\".\nUnder the General tab, there is Panel Opacity. Mine was set to 0.1. I changed it to 1.0. This made the icons visible, but not the text and not the background.\nUnder the Launcher tab, set Launcher Opacity to 1.0.

In your case however I would prefer Ubuntu 13.10, because as a programmer you would benefit by having the latest packages available from the Ubuntu Software Center. \n\nA: I had 12.04 and 13.10. I am using 13.10 at the moment. I would focus on 12.04 if you are looking for a stability and you hard drive contains very important files. \nYou will not face as many errors as in 13.10. New features in 13.10 are not deal breakers in my opinion. Mainly you will get -from my point of view- a more polished system with some extra functions like connecting your social media account + latest packages.  \nI would go with 13.10 only because latest repos. It also looks nicer. If you are looking for a safety just install your home folder on the separate partition and that should help a lot.\n\nA: I can say from my own experience that Ubuntu 13.10 works great on a Lenovo T400. I would suggest installing 13.10 and then upgrading to 14.04 when it comes out in April. 14.04 will be an LTS release with support for 5 years, so you won't have to upgrade for a long time after that if you don't want to. \n", "Q: MacBook Pro 9.2, trying to single install Ubuntu.

Fresh install of 13.10, put \"swap\" and \"/home\" on 80G hdd and then \"/\" on a 32G ssd. Everything works fine BUT when I examine the drives they both have a \"home\" directory with a \"mike\" (that's me) sub directory. \nThis seems like a rather silly thing for the Ubuntu installer to do since I made a point of installing /home first, where I wanted it.  \nMy question now is, which is the real /home and how do I insure the \"mike\" files go only on the hdd as I intended?  Should I delete the /home on the ssd? \nEDIT: Thank you responders. I see now that when I did Search->Disks->Devices and looked at each drive I should have also checked \"Properties\" and then I would have seen the /home folder on the ssd was twice the size of the ssd and therefore it must  represent a link to the /home file on the hdd. \n\nA: They both are the \"real\" /home. If you create a file in your home directory on one it should appear in the other. The reason you see both is because the /home folder on the 80GB HDD is mounted on the root partition as /home\n\nA: Unlike Windows, Ubuntu mounts partitions as folders or sub-folders. When you created /home partition, it created a folder home under / and linked (or mounted) it to the partition in the 80 GB drive.\nTo verify that your home folder inside the 32GB SSD / is the actually the partition in the 80GB HDD, just open the Home in Files (also known as Nautilus) and right click on any empty space and select Properties. You should see more than 32GB of Space in your Home. You can also use Disk Usage Analyzer program to see how the partitions are being used.\nHope this helps\n", "Q: Removing Ubuntu from UEFI Bios Menu I have a Lenovo Ideapad Y510P. I recently removed Ubuntu 12.04 from it, and did a reset on the Windows 8 Partition. However, I still have the Ubuntu option in the firmware (not bios) boot menu, and I want to get rid of it.\nThe problems are (I looked this up ahead of time):\n\n\n*\n\n*In order to boot into the Ubuntu USB I have, I need to be in Legacy Mode.\n\n*In order to run sudo efibootmgr in Ubuntu, I need to be in UEFI Mode. Right now, when I run it, I get the:\ncouldn't open either sysfs or procfs directories for accessing EFI variables \n\nerror (I tried sudo modprobe efivars before it and after it and it looked like it did nothing).\n\n*I can't be in both modes at once.\n\n\nA: You can do this easily using Visual BCD Editor in Windows 7/8/10.\n\n\n*\n\n*Map EFI System drive to Z: using \nmountvol z: /s\n\n*Run Visual BCD Editor and select \"Store\",\"Backup store\". \n\n*a)Click on browse icon in dialog and using the explorer window select\nz: drive - now you have full access to EFI System Partition (ESP).\nb)Click on EFI folder to expand - you will see \"Boot\", \"Microsoft\"\nand \"ubuntu\" folders if you have Windows and Ubuntu installed.\nc) You can delete \"ubuntu\" directory by selecting it and pressing\n\"Del\" key.\n\n*In Visual BCD Editor click on loader entry \"Ubuntu\" to select it and then press \"Del\" key to delete.\n\n\nAfter reboot Ubuntu boot option in UEFI boot menu will be completely gone.\nNote:\nYou could alternatively use bcdedit.exe to delete EFI boot entry for Ubuntu and use command prompt to delete \"ubuntu\" folder from EFI System Partition (drive z:) if you feel more comfortable with commands.\n\nA: Try this:\n\n\n*\n\n*Download the USB flash drive or CD-R version of rEFInd.\n\n*Prepare a medium with rEFInd, as per the instructions in the files you download.\n\n*Boot the rEFInd medium you prepare.\n\n*Use rEFInd to launch an EFI shell.\n\n*Use the bcfg command in the EFI shell to review your boot options. (bcfg boot dump -v should do the trick.)\n\n*Once you've identified your Ubuntu boot option, use the bcfg command to remove it, as in bcfg boot rm 3 if the Ubuntu entry is #3 in the list.\n\n\nThe bcfg command is described in more detail several places on the Internet, such as here. That particular page is mostly concerned with adding an entry, but it does cover some other commands.\nNote also that you might not need rEFInd. Some EFIs include a built-in shell that you can launch in some other way, such as from the firmware's own built-in boot manager; or you can prepare a boot medium that launches an EFI shell directly. I recommended rEFInd simply because the rEFInd USB flash drive and CD-R images include a shell and a way to control that shell's launch. (Note that you will not get the shell if you install rEFInd to your hard disk, unless you install a shell separately.)\n\nA: If your System's EFI is equipped to do this, then you can actually resolve it without needing any kind of bootable media.\nFirstly, some clarification: Your system does not have a BIOS. UEFI is a complete replacement for BIOS. The screen you enter when you hit DEL or ESC or F1 (or whatever your special key is) is called \"system setup\" or \"system configuration\" or \"firmware configuration\". Your system Does have a CSM or Compatibility Support Module more commonly referred to as Legacy Mode.\nLenovo makes some really feature-filled firmware. One of those features is that EFI boot options are stored within the firmware as they are installed. When you or your OEM installed Windows 8, the Windows installer told your UEFI where its boot files are stored and to create an entry pointing to it. When you installed Ubuntu, GRUB did the same thing. It communicated with the UEFI during installation and told it where its boot files were and to add an entry as well. \nNow for the irony: Ubuntu, like most other OS's does not have an 'uninstaller'. The usual method of removing an OS is to delete its partition, or format it, or what have you. So when you delete or otherwise remove an OS the UEFI is never notified. It doesn't know that the OS is no longer there. If you boot with F12 or whatever your key is to select your boot device, it still presents you with it's pointer. So when you go and do a system reset ('refresh' works differently) with Windows 8, it literally reinstalls Windows 8 from the recovery partition. During this installation, the Windows installer probes the UEFI and asks it 'what other OS's are installed?' so that it can populate the Windows 8 bootloader with the other OS's. But as you've probably already guessed, your UEFI's list is incorrect.\nSo here's what you do: If you have this option in your system setup, you can navigate to the boot section and it should list all available boot devices including the EFI boot options. You should be able to select them and remove them. Fixing the Windows 8 boot list then is trivial. You can just do another reset. If you can't remove the boot options, you may have an option under 'Secure Boot' to reinstall security keys. If you select this option, you will need to reinstall windows again, but normally the UEFI will also delete the EFI boot list in the process. Try it and see what works for you.\n\nA: The easiest way to remove \"Ubuntu option\" from boot menu of your laptop is from within Windows. Install EasyUEFI in Windows and you can remove/edit or change the order of all EFI partition entries.\n\nA: Very very simple trick...\nUse a Ubuntu live usb stick.\nChoose try Ubuntu.\nOpen disks.\nMount efi partition or select the partition and click on play logo button below.\nNow it shows a drive with some number. Open it.\nFirst Take a complete backup / copy the complete folder to any drive.\nNow delete the Folder named Ubuntu..\nIf u have hard two drives.\nThen do the same for second drive.\nIf any ubuntu entry found also delete them.\nThat's It.\nRestart.\nGo to bios and check.\nAll done.\nashutosh803101@gmail.com\n\nA: terminal administrator\nbcdedit /enum firmware\nbcdedit /export newbcd\n\ncopy newbcd bcdbackup\nanswer (yes)\nbcdedit /store newbcd /delet <identifier>\nbcdedit /import newbcd /clean\n\n\nA: For this you need to install ubuntu again.\n\n\n*\n\n*After installing open terminal and login as root using command:\nsudo -i\n\n\n*Enter your password, then navigate to root/efi/EFI and delete all directories in it and finally delete the EFI folder and efi.\n\n*Now ubuntu will be removed from your boot menu.\n\n*Finally delete the ubuntu partitions from windows partition manager.\n\nA: To manually open an efi partition from windows launch diskpart from  the command line, then do the following;\n\n\n*\n\n*list volume\n\n*select volume 5 (volume 5 is the efi partition in my case)\n\n*assign\n\n\nThis will mount the EFI partition.Now we have to kill windows explorer and launch it (in admin mode in cmd) from a elevated platform for that\ntaskkill /im explorer.exe /f \n\nexplorer.exe\n\nnow you can open the mounted volume 5 by simply double clicking on it.\n", "Q: How to connect raspberry pi into Ubuntu?

To solve this copy the executable file to your home folder (or any with the ext* partitions or with RW permissions), probably change the file's property to allow execution and then try executing. Or change the partition's property to allow execution of executables.\nSee if this helps...\nIf sda1 is already mounted to /media/your_partition_label, you could unmount it with:\nsudo umount /media/windows\n\nNext create the directory windows in /media/: \nsudo mkdir /media/windows\n\nEdit the /etc/fstab as below: (for NTFS partition)\n/dev/sda1  /media/your_partition_label ntfs-3g  rw,nodev,noexec,auto,nouser,async,locale=en_US.utf8,uid=1000,gid=1000,umask=0002 0 0\n\n(Note: change uid and gid values as for the user.

The problem is that I need to change the port that the second computer is listening on for remote desktop sharing (change default 5900 to 5901). Any ideas on how to do this? I am new to Ubuntu btw. Thanks.\n\nA: Actually you can port-forward the external port 5901 into the internal port 5900 > IP: x and external port 5902 into the internal port 5900 > IP: y, and so on.\nIt is much simpler because you must only configure one thing -- your router -- and you won't have to remember different TCP ports when you want to reach the various PCs from inside your LAN.\n\nA: The comment I left above for configuration editor does not work with 12.04. After some more research I found that you can do this with gsettings instead with the following commands:\ngsettings set org.gnome.Vino alternative-port 1234\ngsettings set org.gnome.Vino use-alternative-port true\n\nwhere 1234 is the new port you wish to use (typically 5901+).\nRemember to setup port forwarding on the wireless router as well. credit goes to: How can I change the port of Remote Desktop?\n", "Q: Scan a file over the Internet by its url using ClamAV Sometimes I have a need to scan the files over the Internet given their urls. I didn't find any information about this capacity at the documentation of ClamAV. Does it allow to do that? How do I get the result of scanning?\n\nA: To scan a file you have to download it. You can only scan it on the server if it is your server and you have remote access to it. So if you want to download it from the terminal and run a scan as soon as it is downloaded, you should use a command like:\nwget -O /tmp/filetoscan http://LINK_TO_THE_FILE && clamscan /tmp/filetoscan\n\nor if you don't need the file after download, you can pipe it to clamscan:\n wget -qO- http://LINK_TO_THE_FILE | clamscan -\n\nThe above will still download the file, the only difference is that it won't store it on your storage. (So your bandwith will be still used during the process, and if you decide that the file is clean, you have to redownload it if you need it on your pc.)\nIf you don't want to download it, then you have to use a cloud service which downloads and scans it for you, e.g virustotal does it and it scans the file with ClamAV also. Virustotal also has a public API which you can use to initiate scans from your terminal or from any program you write.\nIf it is your server with clamAV installed on it and you have ssh access to it, then you just ssh to the server and scan the file just like you would scan it on your client. You can use somwthing like:\nssh YOUR_USER@`echo \"example.com/file1\" | awk -F \"/\" '{print $1}'` \"clamscan /var/www`echo \"example.com/file1\" | awk -F \".com\" '{print $2}'`\"\n\nOf course this depends on your server root (/var/www) and whether there are other settings on the server which should be taken into an account when reconstructing the filepath from the URL, but because you know how your server is set up you can do it.\n\nA: You can use curl to do this:\ncurl http://example.com/file | clamscan -\nBy default, curl will not save the file to your drive space. \n", "Q: Bash : colored copy / paste As everybody, i have a few colorized output in my bash.\nI want to keep the colorized syntax when copying an extract to a HTML editor for example.\nIs there a way to handle this ?\nThanks.\n\nA: If you are talking about colorized output of some command line utilities like ls, grep, cmake, git diff, etc, please note, that it doesn’t have any relations to GNU Bash.\nAnyway, there is several tools for converting output colorized with ANSI escape sequences to HTML:\n\n\n*\n\n*aha from package of the same name\n\n*ansi2html from HTML::FromANSI Perl module (not packaged in Ubuntu repo, can be installed from CPAN)\n\n*ansi2html.sh by pixelb (not packaged, download from git)\n\n\nUsage of all of them is rather simple: they read terminal escape sequences from stdin and put HTML to stdout. But note: most of utils don’t colorize output if it is not going to terminal. You have to order them to produce colorized output explicitly. E. g.:\n$ ls --color=always | aha | xsel -i -b\n\nxsel -i -b here will copy HTML to clipboard.\n\nA: You need to use javascript libraries for that, you cannot directly copy/paste and keep the colours as they are.

There's no need to search anywhere because it's all there in either one or two lines of output.

This means: each commentator receives an email. After upgrading wordpress to 3.8 some bots are able to set a comment without answering the needed captcha in the blog post. \nThat means: a lot of comments which results in a lot of mails.\nWe are hoping to get an update for the re-captcha plugin soon.\nthe queue was filled by emails to heavy-usage gmail spam accounts (the receiver gets to much messages in a given time...)\nSo it is a result of wanted mail-traffic and no \"spamming\" from our server seems to be involved.\n", "Q: how to remove postgres 9.3 and install 9.2 I want to install postgres 9.2 and remove 9.3 on ubuntu 13.04 ,  since I want to install a software and they recommand postgress 9.2, thank you\n\nA: If you installed postgresql from graphical installer, run uninstall.run file from dir where 9.3 was installed /opt/lib/postgresql/9.3 or /var/lib/postgresql/9.3.

I installed Ubuntu first and Apache, MySQL and PHP with that.  Then I installed XAMPP.  I am able to get to /home/username/directory1.  Then I am able to see an index.html file in directory1 and a test.php file in directory1.\nHowever, I changed httpd.conf to take it to /home/username/directory2(in directory 2 I have test.php).\nI am able to see phpinfo() page, which states that I am using directory1. \nPlease help me understand it.  At the moment I get this blindly. Also I am unable to get to XAMPP using localhost/xampp.\nCould this be duplication due to installing Ubuntu + Apache,MySQL and PHP first?\n\nA: Xampp is not packaged with Ubuntu. You can use it but if you are a newbie you might want to stick to the standard and use LAMP instead (which is basically the same but packaged for Ubuntu). If you have a clean system it might indeed be better to just start over and stick to the Ubuntu packaging.\nHaving said that, you state that you changed httpd.conf, this is not the standard Ubuntu config file for Apache. The standard for Ubuntu get its config from: \n\n/etc/apache2/apache2.conf\n\nwithin this file you can enable httpd.conf, thought the standard would be to edit the files in site-available and link them to sites-enabled.\n\nA: For sure you do no have to install apache, mysql, php and then XAMPP. This is a duplicate install. XAMPP is a pre-configured set mainly of this 3 pieces. Lamp it's not my area. \nIf you are new to Linux, I recommend to start again with a fresh OS. Trying to fix everything may lead to hours of work and then hate linux. Then choose how to install lamp, just installing one by one piece or XAMPP. \n", "Q: Another steam launching problem in ubuntu After I installed the steam via Software Center, it won't start at all, just flashed and closed itself.

The poor performance can be caused by the central processing unit (CPU) and the graphics card. Your graphics card is not good enough to run smoothly new games, because most of the integrated graphics cards by Intel are not designed for running games on high resolution and high settings. It has a 64-bit memory bus, low gpu and memory frequencies, etc.\nYou can try to turn off some graphics effects and low down some settings. And, of course, running a game under Linux may cause some lag, because the game is optimized for Windows.\n", "Q: Can I install Ubuntu and then recover files?

You can then create a new partition to store the files you want to keep. A backup of your data is highly recommended before messing around with partitions unless you don't mind losing your data.\nAfter Ubuntu is installed and the data is copied off partition B you can used gparted to delete the second partition and expand partition A to fill the entire disk.\n", "Q: xserver-xorg-core update failed.

That should (a) definitely select the same key as ssh should be selecting, (b) ensure you haven't accidentally added any formatting errors.\nIf that works for you, compare the line added to authorized_keys by ssh-copy-id and hopefully you'll understand what went wrong. \n", "Q: What sort of encryption is used?

First of all, disable the floppy drive, then boot from the USB again, wait 3-4-5 minutes when the boot animation shows up and the installer shoud start.\nThis can happen because of a bug from the USB Startup Disk Creator.

So, how to diagnostics? You can use ping and nmap, but let me tell you, apparently that host isn't public available:\nping -c2 ws.hpc.unipg.it\nPING ws.hpc.unipg.it (141.250.16.254) 56(84) bytes of data.\n--- ws.hpc.unipg.it ping statistics ---\n2 packets transmitted, 0 received, 100% packet loss, time 1008ms\n\nHere it said that the host didn't asnwer my pings\nnmap -p22 ws.hpc.unipg.it\n\nStarting Nmap 6.40 ( http://nmap.org ) at 2013-12-22 11:10 AST\nStats: 0:00:01 elapsed; 0 hosts completed (1 up), 1 undergoing Connect Scan\nConnect Scan Timing: About 50.00% done; ETC: 11:10 (0:00:01 remaining)\nNmap scan report for ws.hpc.unipg.it (141.250.16.254)\nHost is up (0.19s latency).\nrDNS record for 141.250.16.254: gw.hpc.unipg.it\nPORT   STATE    SERVICE\n22/tcp filtered ssh\n\nNmap done: 1 IP address (1 host up) scanned in 2.34 seconds\n\nHere it says that the port is filtered (it could be dropping my packets), hence is very likely I can't connect. When I try to connect, it will timeout my request. So, how to solve this? Contact your system administrator for guidance.\n\nA: One thing to keep in mind is the laptop probably has a different MAC address for each network, or at least for public networks outside your own. You can usually change this in the settings for each network to use your real MAC address instead of a random one.\nThis might matter because you may be verified by your mac address on the remote computer. I'm not sure from that error message if this could be the case, but it's worth knowing. On my local LAN, I ssh into a server, and the key generated for it was done when it was on a wired network. Now, I'm using wireless, and that key no longer works. I think this is the reason.\n\nA: Assuming your wifi is working, this probably means the ssh port is blocked on the wifi network. Or possibly that there is a firewall in front of the server which doesn't recognise the wifi IP addresses as valid.\nIt's possible that you are on some kind of guest wifi network, and you might be able to get better access by registering for another wifi network.\n\nA: Looks like your wifi connection has a firewall blocking port 22. \nAnyway, there are good chances that you can succeed using port 443. \nFirst, test that you can use port 443 to connect via ssh\n$ ssh -T -p 443 git@ssh.github.com\n\nIf you can connect to GitHub p 443, means the WIFI firewall is not blocking port 443, and you should try connecting to your university server at port 443. \n$ ssh -p 443 xxxx@ws.hpc.unipg.it \n\nIf this does not work, means the server ws.hpc.unipg.it does not support the port 443 for ssh connections. \nIn this case, if you have server access, you should edit the ssh configuration to allow ssh connections on port 443: \n\n\n*\n\n*edit the file sshd_config  nano /etc/ssh/sshd_config\n\n*Uncomment the line #Port 22 and transform it into Port 443.\n\n*restart ssh service with sudo systemctl restart ssh\nAnd then, you can connect :)\nNotes:\n\n\n*\n\n*If you cannot connect to github which is known to respond on port 443, then your WIFI firewall blocks also port 443, and you need to go for another solution, like using a VPN.\n\n*In case you cannot connect to server's port 443, and you have no control, ask the admin how to connect to port 443. \n\n", "Q: Must I separate a new disk before installing Ubuntu 12.04.3 alongside windows 8? \nMust I separate a new disk before installing Ubuntu 12.04.3 alongside Windows 8?\nAlso, there is only one NTFS disk named C in my computer and Windows 8 is already on it.\nIs it possible for me to install Ubuntu 12.04.3 alongside Windows 8 in the same disk C?\nThat is to say, I don't want to separate a new disk from C.\n\nA: It's not possible  to install Ubuntu 12.04.3 alongside windows 8 in the same NTFS disk.\n", "Q: rEFInd no longer running on dual boot macbook pro dual boot on macbook pro 9,2 osx 10,9,1 and ubuntu 13,10 after an unrelated upgrade (to iMovie on osx) rEFInd no longer opens on re boot and i have no options on which os to boot? i tried to boot from the ubuntu 13,10 cd but it gets to a black screen and never runs the cd. \n\nA: This happens sometimes when you do OS X updates (even if they seem unrelated, and especially if you try to upgrade your OS X to Mavericks). \nIf you still have the binary files you used to install rEFInd try running the install.sh script again on OS X - there is no need to uninstall rEFInd first, just run the script again.

Is there a better way to store both keys?\nMy ultimate goal here is to not overwrite my git keys, yet generate a ssh public and private key so that I can copy the public key to ~/.ssh/authorized_keys on my web server.\n\nA: Pass the -f option to ssh-keygen to specify a different key file. I recommend names like ~/.ssh/target.id_rsa for the key that lets you log in to target, and use the default name ~/.ssh/id_rsa (if at all) for your default key.\nTo make sure that SSH will always try the right key when you connect (if it doesn't find the right key, it'll prompt you for a password, or will reject the attempt if passwords are disabled), add a IdentityFile directive to ~/.ssh/config, for example:\nHost git\nHostName git.example.org\nUser gitter\nIdentityFile ~/.ssh/git.example.id_rsa\n\nHost web\nHostName mysite.hosting-provider.com\nUser webmaster\nIdentityFile ~/.ssh/hosting-provider.id_rsa\n\n\nA: The very first thing ssh-keygen will ask you is what to name the file.

If I delete from my computer something, will that be deleted from my Ubuntu One cloud? If not, then how can I delete it? I'm new here and I'm confused how all this works...\n\nA: If you delete a file from your Ubuntu One folder,  or any other folder that you selected to sync with Ubuntu One, it will be deleted from your Ubuntu One cloud as well.\nThe Ubuntu One Cloud will not show those files in the browser anymore, however, they may still be available on the server.  \nFrom Ubuntu One help\n\nWhen you delete a file from a desktop or mobile device, it might end\n  up in the Trash folder. It might also skip the Trash (depending on how\n  you deleted it), but when Ubuntu One syncs, it will move that file to\n  the other devices' Trash folder. So, for instance: if you want to\n  recover a file you deleted from your phone, you should be able to see\n  it in your computer's Trash folder.\nAs of October 2013, you also have a way to recover them from the\n  server: In your Ubuntu One profile in the web, you can chose the\n  option \"Recover deleted files\". This will start a job that will\n  recover the deleted files and will place them in a folder called\n  \"Recovered\" followed by the date of the recovery.\nEach time you hit the \"Recover deleted files\" button, Ubuntu One will\n  try to recover all the files deleted since the last time you made a\n  recovery. The first time you try to recover, Ubuntu One will try to\n  recover all the files you deleted since the beginning of times.This\n  might take a while to sync in your devices, depending on how many\n  files are being recovered.\nThe directory structure of the deleted files will be preserved under\n  the \"Recovered\" folder, so when you're looking for a specific file,\n  please take this to account to look in the right place.\nPlease take to account that files deleted more than 60 days ago might\n  not be there. You can try to recover them anyway, but they might have\n  been deleted from the server too.\n\n\nWhile I can tell you from personal experience that the restore files works, it is time consuming as you have to let the files restore to the restore folder then copy them back to the correct folder then delete the restore folder, but it is better than losing them completely.  \n(I did something wrong when syncing my VM and it erased all my synced files, the restore function was able to restore all my lost files, as well as some that were well over 60 days old. (the time must be relative as to how full your cloud is, mine is only 20% filled))\n", "Q: Will be TRIM enabled by default? I heard that Ubuntu 14.04 will feature TRIM by default on SSDs.

Otherwise, go make a swap space, then continue. \nOh but if your drive is > 2 TB then it's probably set to GPT and this could potentially be the root of your HD issue.  In which case...you need to erase the partition table and reset it on that same screen with the partitions.

However, I have been struggling to get it to work on my development server.\nFirst, I generated the keys (I use Ubuntu on both home and server):\n$ ssh-keygen -t rsa -f ~/.ssh/production-key.id_rsa\n\n.ssh$ ls -l\ntotal 36\n-rw-rw-r-- 1 viggy viggy  234 Dec 22 15:21 config\n-rw------- 1 viggy viggy 1766 Dec 22 15:03 development-key.id_rsa\n-rw-r--r-- 1 viggy viggy  397 Dec 22 15:03 development-key.id_rsa.pub\n-rw------- 1 viggy viggy 1766 Dec 22 13:12 production-key.id_rsa\n-rw-r--r-- 1 viggy viggy  397 Dec 22 13:12 production-key.id_rsa.pub\n-rw------- 1 viggy viggy 1766 Sep  5 20:36 id_rsa\n-rw-r--r-- 1 viggy viggy  403 Sep  5 20:36 id_rsa.pub\n-rw-r--r-- 1 viggy viggy 4422 Dec 22 11:45 known_hosts\n\nI added development private key to my config file:\nvim config\nHost production\nHostName xx.xxx.xx.xxx\nUser myuser\nIdentityFile ~/.ssh/production-key.id_rsa\n\nHost development\nHostName xx.xxx.xx.xxx\nUser myuser\nIdentityFile ~/.ssh/development-key.id_rsa\n\nThen I copied public key to server:\ncd ~/.ssh\nvim authorized_keys // deleted contents of this file and copied my development-key.id_rsa.pub into it and saved file\ncat authorized_keys // looked at contents to confirm it matched my development-key.id_rsa.pub\n\nThen I tried to ssh into development server, but it asked for my password (rather than prompting for passphrase).\nSo next I began to troubleshoot why it didn't work. I checked the file/directory permissions on server:\n$ ls -l | grep home\ndrwxr-xr-x   6 root root  4096 Aug  7  2012 home\n$ ls -l | grep myuser\ndrwxr-xr-x 16 myuser myuser  4096 Dec 22 17:47 myuser\n$ ls -la | grep .ssh\ndrwx------  3 myuser myuser       4096 Dec 22 15:32 .ssh\n~/.ssh $ ls -l | grep authorized_keys\n-rw------- 1 myuser myuser  396 Dec 22 15:32 authorized_keys\n\nNext I looked at the sshd_config file to confirm its configurations. Now I do not have password authentication disabled yet, but I don't have it disabled on my other server either and the ssh keys worked:\n$ cd /etc/ssh\n$ head -n 1000 sshd_config | grep 'PasswordAuthentication'\n#PasswordAuthentication yes\n\nI checked to see if any accounts were not allowed access to ssh (but there was nothing unusual here):\n$ head -n 1000 sshd_config | grep 'AllowUsers'\n$ head -n 1000 sshd_config | grep 'DenyUsers'\n\nI made sure public key authentication was enabled:\nhead -n 1000 sshd_config | grep 'PubkeyAuthentication'\nPubkeyAuthentication yes\n$ head -n 1000 sshd_config | grep 'RSAAuthentication'\nRSAAuthentication yes\nRhostsRSAAuthentication no\n\nI then restarted the ssh server:\nsudo restart ssh\n\nI then checked if my home directory is encrypted but it's not:\nls -A /home\n.directory   lost+found  quota.group  someuser\nmyuser  passenger   quota.user\n\nI checked perhaps there was some other configuration on the system:\n/ $ locate sshd_config\n/etc/ssh/sshd_config\n/usr/share/doc/openssh-client/examples/sshd_config\n/usr/share/man/man5/sshd_config.5.gz\n\nI tried the suggestions here:\nssh no longer allows public key authentication\nSo finally I tried ssh in debug mode, and this is what I got (I changed the ip address and usernames):\nssh -vv myuser@xx.xxx.xx.xxx\nOpenSSH_5.9p1 Debian-5ubuntu1.1, OpenSSL 1.0.1 14

The first card is an Intel HD 4400, and the second card is the AMD Radeon HD 8670M (solar system series, not OLAND). Thus, currently the open-source radeon driver does not support the card, and I am forced to use the proprietary fglrx driver.\nWhy not just turn the dGPU  card off without fglrx?\nI have no need of fancy graphics and would be happy to simply turn the discrete ATI card off, so long as it was properly switched off and was not overheating/eating battery. The options to do this without fglrx and pxpress seemed limited to me: I have no vgaswitcheroo switch (even before fglrx was ever installed) and I can only deduce this was because the radeon driver does not yet support my card/does not properly load it yet, see my question here for more on that and the things I tried. Other methods like acpi_call have been reported as at best \"proof of concept\" and at worst dangerous, so I'd rather not venture into using them. More reliable projects like bumbleebee are nividia only.\nSimply leave the AMD card driverless\nRelying on just the i915 intel driver works flawlessly, no bugs, no problems, however the AMD card is then left UNCLAIMED and could possibly lead to overheating/battery drain, so I am not so happy about that.\nUbuntu 12.04 LTS with fglrx\nI started here, and experienced a bug when the iGPU was selected. This bug manifests itself whenever the screen is locked, the laptop lid is closed, or even when the computer is left inactive with something like xscreensaver installed instead with no lockscreen enabled. It causes a black screen with a moveable cursor only; switching tty and back does not recover, and a restart from the tty is needed. It does not happen every single time but happens pretty regularly, at least once or twice day. All saved work is lost.\nI tried both the fglrx in the repos, and the latest 13.10 from the AMD website. No change.\nWhen the dGPU is selected instead (from the AMD Catalyst control centre, or ultimately by pxpress) this bug does not occur, but I had another bug which I won't bother getting into here.\nUbuntu 13.10 with fglrx\nA very similar bug here but not quite as severe. Exactly the same conditions, namely lockscreen, lidclose, inactivity (if xscreensaver is being used). This time the frozen screen is not black, but a picture of your desktop at the moment of the freeze, again with moveable cursor. Here I only tried the latest fglrx AMD drivers 13.10. \nAgain no problems with just the i915 driver (no fglrx) and again no problems with dGPU selected.\nSome things I tried:\n1) Disabling vsync. I tried this both in compiz settings manager, and by aticonfig --sync-vsync=off followed by reboot. No change.\n2) Turning DPMS off. Option      \"DPMS\" \"false\" in the xorg.conf monitor stanza. (Of course, I also changing gnome settings \"Do Nothing/Don't suspend\" for battery and AC too).No change.\n3) Option \"AIGLX\" \"off\" in server flags of xorg.conf. No change.\n4)  Modifying the atieventsd so it worked properly for Ubuntu, see my post here. And also, running without it. No change.\n5) Booting with the options\nOption      \"Capabilities\" \"0x00000800\"\nOption      \"KernelModuleParm\" \"locked-userpages=0\"\nOption      \"NoAccel\" \"True\"\n\nin the xorg.conf Device stanza. No change.\n6) Booting with nomodeset as kernel parameter. No change.\n7) Turning off acpi interaction from aticonfig:\n--acpi-services=off\n--acpi-display-switch=off\n\nNo change.\nWhy does it work with just intel?\nOne thing I don't understand is why it works with the just the intel i915 driver. I thought pxpress would just hand over control to that driver on bootup, so if it worked with the i915 alone, I'd have expected it to work with pxpress selecting igpu. \nI know fglrx installs its own libGl implemenation also, but it switches back to the old stock MESA libGL implementation when the intel card is selected (c.f. /usr/lib/fglrx/switchlibGL python script). \nSo when igpu selected, it should be exactly equivalent to life before fglrx after a reboot?\n\nA: After a long time looking into this, I came to release the key point: when fglrx/pxpress loads the Intel driver, it does so with the UXA acceleration method, whereas by default (on a Haswell system running 13.10, pre-fglrx install) the Intel driver would load with the SNA acceleration method.\nI tested by booting with an xorg.conf that looked like:\nSection \"Device\"\n        Identifier      \"Intel Graphics\"\n        Driver          \"intel\"\n        Option          \"AccelMethod\"  \"UXA\" # (fglrx uses this) I can see the bug\n        #Option          \"AccelMethod\"  \"SNA\" #(default) no bug!\nEndSection\n\nSection \"Monitor\"\n           Identifier      \"Configured Monitor\"\nEndSection\n\nSection \"Screen\"\n        Identifier      \"Default Screen\"\n        Monitor         \"Configured Monitor\"\n        Device          \"Configured Video Device\"\nEndSection\n\nNow even this Intel xorg.conf gave the freeze bug after a lid close or two. Yet booting with the exact same config file, only with\nOption          \"AccelMethod\"  \"SNA\" \n\nI got no bug whatsoever, no matter how many lid closes/screen locks (this is the default method for the driver anyway, and this is why I was perplexed, because it fooled me into thinking all was good with the intel driver and fglrx was tainting things).\nNow that I realised this was a intel driver problem, some googling led me to discover a fix. Create a file ~/.drirc to config the DRI settings, containing\n<device screen=\"0\" driver=\"dri2\">\n        <application name=\"Default\">\n                <option name=\"vblank_mode\" value=\"0\"/>\n        </application>\n</device>\n\nThis turns off vsync (the setting that makes your GFX card sync to the screen refresh rate, rather than speeding away at its intrinsic framerate, to avoid tearing). Note: there is no point turning off vsync with aticonfig as in my OP as this will just turn it off for the dGPU not the Intel card. I'm not sure why my attempt at turning it off with Compiz Settings Manager did not work though.\nEven with the UXA method, turning off vsync this way stopped the crash, even for the fglrx xorg.conf.\nEven better would be to somehow configure pxpress to load the Intel driver with the SNA options, see my post here \n", "Q: Which Linux distros support VMWare's autofit guest feature?

I use it to connect to my Blu-ray player, which has a USB port, to watch movies.  Frequently, movie files are over 4gb and will not transfer to the drive from my computer.  The Blu-ray player will only recognize the fat32 file system.  Is there a way to overcome this within Ubuntu?  Perhaps a terminal command that I am not aware of?  As a last resort, can you recommend a program that will split the file in half, transfer it the external HDD, and re-assemble it there?  Any advice will be appreciated.\nWhen I use the split -b command, the second file that it creates is unreadable.  I am perplexed.\nCan anyone recommend methods of splitting the file using ffmpeg or mencoder?  I have read about both, but have not been able to do what I need done with them.\n\nA: No; fat32 only supports 4 GiB files.  If you need larger files you will have to use a different filesystem ( ntfs if you need to share it with Windows, otherwise ext4 ).\n\nA: You can try formatting the drive as exFAT http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ExFAT.

That is the game should be able to be launched through the Steam interface without any extra steps.\nNow whether or not the game works perfectly (or even runs at all) may or may not be the case. That depends on the game requirements among other things.\nKeep in mind that there is also a native Linux version of Steam available (although you will only be able to play games that are supported with Linux - there are many available and more coming all the time).\nHere is a link to the Steam site that tells you how to install Steam on Linux as well as how to install Steam on playforlinux:\nhttps://developer.valvesoftware.com/wiki/Steam_under_Linux\n\nA: You need to open PlayOnLinux and click install, then click the link to installing a non-listed program or game.

I then moved the ISO to my laptop, which runs Ubuntu 12.04, and it would mount the ISO, but it would appear to be empty. I then tried to open the ISO in the Archive Manager, and it gave me this error:\nCD-ROM is NOT in ISO 9660 format\n\nSo, instead of trying to mess with it, I went back to my desktop, thinking it was just Ubuntu not supporting this ISO. So I extracted the files from the ISO, then moved them to my USB drive.\nWhen I plugged my USB drive back into my laptop, Ubuntu read the USB, but only says that there are two folders on the USB, and no other files, such as the rest of the files I had put on there. It still says that there is 6 GB used by the USB drive, but there is nothing there. \nWhy is it doing this? Could it be something with the formatting of the programs?\nHow could I fix this?\nEDIT 1: I think I found a solution, and am testing now.\nEdit 2: Did not work, still not showing certain files.

I just installed a fresh Ubuntu 13.10 and observed the following behavior: My desktop icons are all very tiny and the corresponding file names are not displayed. The following example shows my desktop containing a few LibreOffice documents and a PDF:\n\nIs this behavior expected? And what can I do to get more traditional desktop icons (larger, with text)?\nSo far I tried not to do anything like unity --reset (which apparently is no longer supported in 13.10 anyways) because the icon problem was already present in the very first boot after the fresh installation, and it would be great if I won't lose all other Unity settings that I have configured in the last few hours.\n\nA: It turned out, I accidentally made a stupid mistake: One of the first things after installing Ubuntu is to reduce the default size of the list view in nautilus (since imho all default settings are much too large). As a result of my reduce-all-sizes I must have changed the \"Default zoom level\" under \"Icon View Defaults\" (under the \"View\" tab in nautilus' preferences) to the lowest level as well. Since I never ever use the icon view, I never realized that I've made this change and somehow it never occurred to me that this settings affects the look of my desktop icons as well... So in the end, I was able to solve this \"issue\" simply by setting an icon zoom level of 100% in nautilus.\n\nA: Try this command in terminal:\ngsettings set org.gnome.desktop.background show-desktop-icons false\ngsettings set org.gnome.desktop.background show-desktop-icons true\n\n\nOr try changing the icon theme:\ngsettings set org.gnome.desktop.interface icon-theme gnome\ngsettings set org.gnome.desktop.interface icon-theme ubuntu-mono-light\n\n\nA: You should be able to right click on the icons and select \"Restore Icon's Original Size\"  \n\nAt the moment I'm not sure why your icon's text isn't showing.. I'll have to look into that. When was the last time you restarted and updated?\n\nA: I encounter the same problem on Ubuntu 14.04 LTS.\nI solved it by closing the Unity session.\nThen switch to TTY1 and remove folders like .gnome2, .gconf, .local in home directory.\nI don't know which of them was the guilty one, but the clue is to logout from Unity before deleting or renaming them.\n", "Q: Third Party Software was not Installed I did a fresh install of UbuntuGNOME 13.10.

For most games this works out-of-the-box but some games such as Shutter identify the two controllers as being only one. I found out that in the \"Shatter-case\" the \"Bus-Vendor-Product-Version\" information that is provided by e.g. cat /proc/bus/input/devices is used to identify the gamepad (which is identical for the both controllers):\nI: Bus=0003 Vendor=054c Product=0268 Version=0111\nN: Name=\"Sony PLAYSTATION(R)3 Controller\"\n\nThere is a config file for Shatter (~/.sidhe/Shatter/data/profiles/default_plr_profile.xml) that stores the information like this:\n<singleplayer_controller_guid>gamepad_030000004c0500006802000011010000</singleplayer_controller_guid>\n\nDo you have any ideas how I could work around this (maybe changing the \"Product\"-id or something like that for one controller)?\n\nA: That sounds like a bug in SDL2. GUIDS are generated like this:\nhttp://hg.libsdl.org/SDL/file/a9d1c47bb1aa/src/joystick/linux/SDL_sysjoystick.c#l117\nAnd are used primarily for configuring the controller. However the GUID is only identifying the controller type not the actual controller, so two controllers of the same type generate the same GUID, which is not what GUIDs should do.\nAs for workaround, xboxdrv has support for PS3 controllers when connected via USB. In case you prefer Blutooth xboxdrv can also emulate a virtual controller on top of a regular one and allows you to fiddle with product, vendor, etc. on the virtual one, see examples/evdev.xboxdrv.\nMade a bug report: https://bugzilla.libsdl.org/show_bug.cgi?id=2327\n", "Q: Looked around A LOT but can't avoid black screen after logging into Ubuntu VM from Mac 10.6 host I've looked at many for ideas and suggestions (here are a few)\nMy computer boots to a black screen, what options do I have to fix it?\nUbuntu 12.10 desktop/interface not showing on VirtualBox VM after login screen\nHow do I install Guest Additions in a VirtualBox VM?\nCan I install extra drivers via the command prompt?\nI know these are of disparate topics - but I finally did succeed in installing the guest additions.

No changes to /etc/apt/sources.list were needed to fix the problem.\n\nA: I had the same issue using my own apt-mirror server to update the git-core package.\nIn my case, I resolved the issue by adding [arch=amd64] in the original entry in the /etc/apt/sources.list.\nExample:\nOriginal: deb http://192.168.111.222/mirror/git-core precise main\nSolution: deb [arch=amd64] http://192.168.111.222/mirror/git-core precise main\nThe details can be found at: https://wiki.ubuntu.com/MultiarchSpec#apt_sources\nIn your case, you need to edit /etc/apt/sources.list.d/apt-build.list.\n\nA: I had to make one more slight correction, i.e.:\ndeb [arch=amd64 trusted=yes]  file:/var/cache/apt-build/repository apt-build main\n\nbefore apt stopped complaining - I've never dealt with the sources.list's [options] before, so it took me a few minutes of googling and trial/errorring to get it right...\n\nA: Basically, if you want to keep a mess with your OS and different architecture repositories, then you can add [arch=amd64] as a one-off fix (you will need to do it for each repository, which is annoying)\nEspecially, whenever you need to do it at the company level, it is easier to do like this:\nsudo dpkg --remove-architecture i386\n\n", "Q: Horizon: Apache exceptions at import_module I've deployed Openstack using juju, and everything looks normal except that I cannot browse to openstack-dashboard.

The fix will be included in the next development (1.17.3) or stable (1.18.0) version of juju-core.\nThe problem was on precise (12.04) machines, juju was adding the cloud-tools archive to get a version of mongodb-server on precise that works with juju. Now, the cloud-tools pocket is added with lower priority, so that packages in it won't try to interfere with packages from the main archive (used by charms).\n", "Q: I don't have \"additional drivers\" on my ubuntu?

It gaves me the \"NoneType object has no attribuite get_info\" error, with every iso I tried from 12.04 to 13.10 (downloaded from mirrors and torrents too!).\nCan anyone provide me an iso with the install alongside thing? Or at least help me? I'm not familiar with shrinking, resising and doing magic with partitions so I would like to avoid that.\n\nA: It's curious that the installation process won't allow you to install Ubuntu alongside Windows, but it suggest you to install inside it. \nFirst of all, sorry if my question will seem completely idiot, did you start your pc from the live usb? Because wubi invocation seems strange, unless you've started it from windows itself. And ... if instead of using an usb-key, you boot from an ubuntu live CD/DVD? Have you already tried? And it gives you the same answer?\nWith regard to \"other options\", why are you so scared? Obviously you must pay attention when choosing HDU and partitioning it, but it's not so difficult, imho.\nAnyway, my first suggestion is to burn a DVD from Ubuntu ISO and try installing from there: if your pc haven't any dvd burner you probably can ask to your friends for an usb one.\nCheers and merry Christmas!\nSilvia\n\nA: I suggest you use bootable USB drive than Wubi installer,\nCreate a bootable USB from iso file using poweriso\nselect tools > make bootable USB in power iso\nthat will create a bootable USB for any version of ubuntu.\nRestarting your system should give you an prompt for installing Ubuntu\n", "Q: Failed installation I'm installing ubuntu as my first OS on my laptop from a bootable DvD,now it all goes good,but at about 90ish % my disc starts making a weird noise and the installation crashes.Now I don't know what my problem here is,so please help!\n\nA: it sounds link a problem with the DVD itself.\nTry installing Ubuntu using a USB drive.\nYou can make one using UnetBootin\n", "Q: How to be superuser in ubuntu 13.10 To install a .run file I am using \nsu - \n\nto be super user in terminal,it asks for password but on entering password it show following error\nsu: Authentication failure\n\n\nA: have you tried with sudo -i or simply sudo ./yourCommand (or something like that: sudo sh yourCommand ....)?

Your original command likely failed because you you used a source path of linux/ and the trailing / leaves an undefined path in the command.

In the last year I had a problem with my notebook: sometimes when I push the power button it starts (I hear the fan) but nothing appears on the screen, I have to hit it on the bottom to make it start..\nIn the last month the problem changed: now it starts every time without need of hitting it but it shuts down without any apparent reason and then immediately reboots. This happens more frequently when the notebook is JUST turned on or when is turned on from a while but I am not using it. In addition if I instead boot Windows (installed on another partition) the problem disappears...\n\nMy hypothesis is that the problem is in the hard disk, so I came to the questions:\n\n\n*\n\n*How can I verify my hypothesis? Is it plausible?\n\n*Since Windows in in sda2, Ubuntu in sda5 and sda3 contains only data do you think it is a good idea to move Ubuntu to the left (resizing sda3) and then leaving the last part of the disk (where probably there is the problem) empty (in a new partition)?\n\n\nA: \nIn the last year I had a problem with my notebook: sometimes when I push the power button it starts (I hear the fan) but nothing appears on the screen, I have to hit it on the bottom to make it start..\n\nThats a hardware problem and it is not related to your hard drive. The soldering of one of your chips (most likely your VGA) on your motherboard is broken. Simply speaking the connection between the chip and the motherboard became bad. When you hit it at the bottom, the connection between the chip and the MOBO is improved a bit and it manages to start. \nYou need a BGA Rework for your laptop.\nBut if you think that it is your HDD, then just boot from a Live USB, and use that one for a while. If it still shuts down, you can be sure that the problem is not with the HDD, if it won't shut down, then the HDD is the guilty.\n", "Q: Network manager and sutdown not working Most of the functionality have stopped working after I changed the permission of lib folder.

The difference between installing Ubuntu with sudo apt-get install kubuntu-desktop and installing Kubuntu CD/DVD is that the CD/DVD has the packages of kubuntu-desktop and doesn't have to download them.\nThe last chance you have is download all the .deb packages of kubuntu-desktop and install them manually over Ubuntu (instead of apt-get which uses Internet connection).\n", "Q: unable to locate package error when installing Matlab 2013a 10 yesterday I downloaded matlab R2013a from university website\nBut it says\nelif@ubuntu:~$ sudo apt-get install MATHWORKS_R2013A\nReading package lists...

I can't understand what the solution is.\nHow to fix this?\nP.S. I'm a beginner in Ubuntu, though I have used it as a production server and desktop environment for a week.\n\nA: Wubi boots via the Windows host OS's boot manager (using grub4dos). It doesn't install it's own bootloader so it can't boot independently. Therefore booting from the external drive won't do anything. \nWubi is not portable either (maybe with some manual effort, but not in a practical way).\nSo if you want a portable install on an external drive, you need to do a proper install. That will be fully portable (assuming you don't need custom graphics drivers on one computer, but not the other).\n", "Q: how to make sure my keys are recording to do some action?

So my question is how can I know,  by pressing which keys that has terminal opened at that time ?\nyou can consider my Question as some log related issue too.\n\nA: The problem with this is that there are many layers of applications which a key combination has to transverse for being applicable. To put an example:\nI press Ctrl + Alt + U. First the Xorg server takes my keypresses and analyzes them, if it's not registered then it pass it to the next layer which is the Desktop Manager, if the desktop manager doesn't have any registered key combination like that, then it pass it to the current active window/application which is the end of the road.\nIf none of those layers recognize that key combination then it just sends the keypresses to be written.

It ran great for me, it was super fast, and I thought it looked superb. \nI've already done a little bit of Googling and apparently it's impossible to install an old version of Unity, so I was wondering if there was any form of hack to at least bring back the old styling of it (an actual menu bar button instead of the dock icon) \n\nIn theory I could just use the older version (which is what I'd love to do, I loved Natty.

I think Ubuntu Software Center can install .deb packages\n\n\nIf this does work, your system may be unstable and programs are going to crash a lot. However I could be wrong and installing older Unity could be completely fine.

The browser will open the youtube\nlinks in the list in separated tabs, the list should be separated by a space.

This line\nwill be executed only after Line 5 finishes waiting (\"sleeping\") the\namount of seconds stored on the \"n\" variable.\n\n*Line 7: We celebrate saying \"all done!\" in the terminal.\n\n\nA more complex example can be made with this 7 lines, indeed.

The download link took me to Ubuntu Server for Cloud (where the download began). I downloaded the latest server package, which is 13.10.\nThe best I can tell, there's no Cloud stuff on that CD. When I installed the server package, I was asked if I wanted to enable the SSH server, the SAMBA server, install a print server, etc. But there was no choice for \"Cloud Server\".\nAdditionally, after reboot, there is nothing running that looks like its cloud related, like Keystone (identity management), Glance (image manager), Nova or Nuetron (compute), Ceph or Swift (object storage), etc.\nI'm obviously missing something, here, but I don't know what it is.

That includes my books like OpenStack Cloud Computing Cookbook.\nWhat, precisely, does Ubuntu OpenStack provide? Am I supposed to do something else next (apparently, but I don't know what)?\n\nA: \nThere are three (3) different Ubuntu OpenStack installation options, depending on whether you plan to build your own infrastructure, run Ubuntu as a guest on existing infrastructure (be it public or private) or you want to deploy services on a working cloud with Juju Charms.\n\n\n*\n\n*Ubuntu Cloud Guest:\nThis can be done using any of the existing services: Amazon EC2, HP Cloud, Windows Azure, Rackspace Cloud.

Running Ubuntu 12.04 on a dell xps m140. I am trying to run a .jar 'applet (is that the correct word?). It is a server to use my android as a wireless mouse over wifi. I tried executing it with openjava 6 and 7, and keep getting this problem; however it worked fine the first time I ran it...\nI right click on the file \"AioServer3.4.2.jar\" and select to open with the java 6/7 runtime.

Every time I use Nautilus and navigate to a specific subdirectory inside my home directory, Nautilus instantly closes, and the desktop wallpaper disappears too.

There are around 30 files in there, total maybe 200kB, mostly plaintext log files plus a few php files. \nI've also just rebooted into recovery mode and ran the fsck option, just to make sure there's nothing corrupt going on, but it didn't resolve the problem.\nI still think that there's some kind of file corruption going on, but I have run out of ideas.\nThis is a fully updated version of plain Ubuntu 13.10 without any memorable hacks or customizations (apart from moving /home to a 1TB drive while Ubuntu runs off of an SSD). The physical computer is almost new and has lots of memory; I don't think it's in any way hardware-related.\nHow can I troubleshoot a faulty subdirectory?\n\nA: falconer's answer got me on the right track -- there was a favicon.gif in the directory that caused the error. That file must somehow be corrupt. I deleted that file and then Nautilus stopped crashing. I navigated to another subdirectory that still contains an exact copy of that file, and it crashes.\nI'll see how I can report this crash as a bug. Even a malformed image file should not make the file browser crash...\n\nA: I think the problem is with the cached thumbnails which Nautilus tries to load when you open that library. On 13.10 the thumbnails are stored in ~/.cache/thumbnails try emptying that directory and see if it helps.\nIf it still doesn't help maybe on of the thumbnailer plugins of nautilus is broken, which deals with a specific filetype in that folder. In this case look in that directory and check if there is a filetype which is not in other directories.\nOr a file in that directory is corrupted and when you open that directory Nautilus tries to cache it, but it fails because of the corruption. In this case you should check those files whether they are working and not corrupted.\n\nA: There's an open bug about this problem in launchpad:\nhttps://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/nautilus-python/+bug/1203349\nBasically, a 0 length file or a corrupted file sitting in a folder are enough to make nautilus crash when it tries to build their thumbnail. \nThe fastest solution seems to be to open a terminal and rm path/to/zero-length-file (if you're lucky) or identify and rm path/to/corrupted-file (if you're unlucky).\nSomeone reported to have solved the problem by upgrading libgtk-3-0_3.8.6 to 3-0_3.8.7, but when I'm writing that version of libgtk has not been officially released for 13.10.\n", "Q: Installing Konica minolta PP1400w New Installation Ubuntu 13.10 Samba4 installed\nPrinter HP Color LaserJet and Canon 4550 already successfully installed and networked to\nwindows 7 machine.\nPrinter connected to machine via USB and detected by add printer software however when I continue it either stalls or give a installing driver screen and then returns to the select device screen.\nThe printer was installed in previous versions of Ubuntu up to 13.04\n\nA: That printer has never been supported on Linux by Konica.

In order to get the Fedora 20 installer to work I had to boot with the nomodeset kernel parameter.  This made it into the installed GRUB2 configuration.  I'm not sure whether that is intentional or not, but it is unnecessary because the installed GRUB2 configuration includes parameters to blacklist the nouveau driver, which conflicts with the NVIDIA hardware.\nThe full final solution is to remove the nomodeset kernel parameter and add the acpi_backlight=vendor kernel parameter.  The procedure is as follows:\nTesting\n\n\n*\n\n*First, to test that this is the solution, reboot the system and at the GRUB2 boot menu, press 'e' to edit the configuration, scroll down and edit the linux or linuxefi line (depending on whether you have a BIOS or UEFI - my laptop had UEFI).\n\n\n*\n\n*Remove the nomodeset parameter if present.\n\n*Add the parameter acpi_backlight=vendor\n\n*My configuration also contained \"nouveau.modeset=0 rd.driver.blacklist=nouveau\" which I believe is the magic incantation to prevent nouveau from conflicting with the NVIDIA driver.  I left that in there and it did no harm.\n\n\n*Press F10 to continue booting the system.  You should be able to adjust screen brightness with the keyboard and a symlinked directory /sys/class/backlight/intel_backlight will now exist.\n\n*Untested: I believe that a range of client applications that depend on ACPI data in the /sys filesystem will now work also.\n\n\nMaking the Fix Permanent \n\n\n*\n\n*As root, edit /etc/default/grub and modify the GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX= line to:\n\n\n*\n\n*Remove the nomodeset parameter.\n\n*Add acpi_backlight=vendor\n\n\n*Finalise the changes to the GRUB2 configuration.\n\n\n*\n\n*On Ubuntu, the command is apparently \"update-grub\".\n\n*On Fedora 20, with UEFI, I first backed up /etc/grub2-efi.cfg and then did: grub2-mkconfig -o /etc/grub2-efi.cfg.  I have read elsewhere that the file to update is /etc/grub2.cfg, however, on my system that is a blind symlink and when I tried using it the changes did not take effect.  I assume that file is only consulted on BIOS systems.\n\n\n*That's it. You can then reboot the system and it should all work.\n\n", "Q: Gnome doesn't store password in keyring I'm on 12.04, trying to extract my login credintials from ~/.gnome2/keyrings/login.keyring and not having much luck, looks like that keyring is empty. seahorse is showing it as an empty keystore. I tried deleting it but it gets re-created upon login while still remains empty. \npam configs do seem to call keyring daemon:\n\n$ grep keyring /etc/pam.d/*\ncommon-password:password    optional    pam_gnome_keyring.so \ngdm:auth    optional        pam_gnome_keyring.so\ngdm:session optional        pam_gnome_keyring.so auto_start\ngnome-screensaver:auth optional pam_gnome_keyring.so\nlightdm:auth    optional        pam_gnome_keyring.so\nlightdm:session optional        pam_gnome_keyring.so auto_start\n\nWhat am I missing? \n\nA: No, your local system password is not stored in the keyring. The login keyring will remain empty until you authenticate to some service in an application which stores passwords or tokens in the keyring. The pam integration is to allow keeping the login passowrd, and your keyring password, in sync, and to allow unlocking the keyring automatically, when you log in.\n", "Q: Can I use my laptop as a second monitor for my desktop? I want to know if its possible to use my laptop as a second screen. Both my laptop and desktop have Ubuntu 12.04.\n\nA: I'm afraid you cannot simply connect your laptop to your desktop as if it was a TV or desktop monitor, because laptops generally only provide video outputs but no video inputs.\nOne might be able to pull something like that off by using a complex setup of Xdmx, synergy and probably some virtualisation/remote access software or protocols (e.g. spice) to get a virtual second screen on the desktop and to display it on the laptop (and access the laptop from your desktop via synergy). Of course this also comes with a huge computing overhead.\nI don't know of any hardware solutions that would allow something like that, but I guess they would be almost as expensive as another desktop monitor.\n", "Q: Login credentials stored somewhere? What happens to login credentials after I authenticate with lightdm? Is there are process that stores them? Would this be something that PAM caches somewhere? Would lightdm hang on to them?\nThe problem I'm trying to solve is re-requesting TGT without prompting for password long after user has been authenticated. For example, I authenticated with lightdm, worked on my laptop, started VPN session, logged into a different network and would like to acquire TGT without having to enter my password again. The only way I can see doing this if credentials are stored somewhere and I can re-use them or if I could somehow figure out who (which process) takes care of getting TGT after I initially authenticate (which does happen automatically) and sort of \"poke\" that process to go do it again (but that means the process would have to have my credentials stored somewhere)... \n\nA: No, your credentials are not stored or cached anywhere, when you log in. If you want to use single sign-on for access to resources on your machine and a network, then you should set up a kerberos authentication server, and set up your services to use kerberos for authentication. With kerberos, when you log in, the server gives you a session token which is cached, and which can then be used by other applications to authenticate to resources within the domain of the server providing the token.\n", "Q: How can I remote control Ubuntu from a Mac? So I am going out of town for a month and want to be able to control my Ubuntu from my MacBook Pro since it will be mining litecoins and I want to be able to make sure it starts up/works correctly if something happens (power outage, server goes down, etc).\nHow do I go about this?\nWhat do I need to do to get my computer to reboot automatically since I wouldn't be able to access Ubuntu if the computer is off (right?)? Is that in the BIOS?\nWhat steps do I need to do in order to access the computer from my Mac?\n\nA: It depends on your BIOS and Network Configuration.\nFrom your BIOS, look for the option to restore from AC Power Loss normally containing \nRestore from AC power loss [always off | always on | last state].\nI normally put it to last state, so if there is a power loss when it is off it will remain off, however if it is on during the power loss, it will automatically turn on when power comes back.\nAlso, you can enable the Wake on LAN feature on your BIOS if you can remotely access your router. For that, read : WakeOnLan\nTo access your Ubuntu from a Mac, you may need to install a remote control software like TeamViewer.\nGoodluck.\n", "Q: Why wmctrl doesn't work for certain windows? francisco@Ubuntu:~$ wmctrl -l\n0x02600006  0 Ubuntu Área de trabalho\n0x03c00002  0 Ubuntu XdndCollectionWindowImp\n0x03c00005  0 Ubuntu unity-launcher\n0x03c00008  0 Ubuntu unity-panel\n0x03c0000b  0 Ubuntu unity-dash\n0x03c0000c  0 Ubuntu Hud\n0x046000b3  0 Ubuntu How to make a window aways on top? - Stack Overflow - Mozilla Firefox\n0x0520000b  0    N/A Qt Creator\n0x05002396  0 Ubuntu francisco@Ubuntu: ~\n0x0540000b  0    N/A backlight\n\nFor windows that have the machine name column as N/A I'm unable to send wmctrl commands like wmctrl -r \"window name\" -b add,above. Why? (also, I don't know why these windows are different regarding the machine name column...)\nMy initial intent was to send such command to the backlight window, a frameless Qt application. Using the window system menu and checking the \"Always On Top\" works for the window though. I just like a programmatic means of doing the same.\n\nA: it's definitely a bug in wmctrl.\nafter digging around wmctrl code, it seems that the bug is in translating window name strings to the corresponding Window ID (or XID). so wmctrl -r \"window name\" -b add,above is not reliable.\nas a workaround, use XID instead, i.e. wmctrl -i -r window_id -b add,above. in your case , wmctrl -i -r 0x0520000b -b add,above should work.\nmost window management facilities are implemented as X window Properties. you can view all the properties of a window by a command -- xprop.\nNOTE:\n\n\n*\n\n*Windows that have the machine name column as N/A. \nthe machine name property is WM_CLIENT_MACHINE. it's rarely used. and some GUI toolkits may not implement them.\nyou can view a window's machine name property by run following command line and click the window\nshell> xprop | grep MACHINE\n\n\n*As for Always On Top, it's another property value _NET_WM_STATE_ABOVE.\nto check it yourself, \nrun following command line and click the window  \nshell> xprop | grep _NET_WM_STATE\n\n", "Q: How to keep icon in unity launcher and remove from desktop? A number of applications (e.g. Crashplan) install a desktop icon. This can be moved to also appear in the Unity launcher bar, so now there are two icons. If I delete the desktop one the unity bar one also disappears. \nIs there a way to just keep the one in the Unity bar? \n\nA: Instead of drag and drop to the Unity launcher, simply move the icon to ~/.local/share/applications in which ~ is your home folder. \nCreate one if any of these folders doesn’t exist. \nAfter moving it to the folder, the icon will appear on Dash and can be locked to the launcher.\nEdit: I forgot to mention if you wanted all users to see the icon, you should move it to the directory /usr/share/applications/.\n\nA: I'm on 16.04 Ubuntu and here is how I remove the desktop Icon and put it into the Launcher:\n\n\n*\n\n*Move Icon to Trash using the Right mouse click menu\n\n*Open Trash\n\n*Drag the Associated file for the icon from Trash over to the Launcher and drop it into the launcher.\n\n*Now you only have an Icon in the Launcher \n\n", "Q: gnome ppp installation without connection Is there any way to install the gnome ppp package without an online connection. It opens in the software center but the install button is not active. I currently have wvdial package and gnome ppp package on desktop and have attempted to install with terminal. the result: dpkg: command not found. Is this a permissions problem? I'm running 11.10 and attempting to set myself up to connect via external modem.\n\nA: It is always better to install a package using apt or Software Center. It installs the package along with all its dependencies. But it needs active connection. \nTo install a package offline you need to download the package along with all its dependencies on a system where internet connection is available. Next you need to copy the downloads to your offline system in order to install them.\nTo do this you can go to packages.ubuntu.com and search for gnome-ppp. Don't forget to choose correct distribution. Download the .deb file with appropriate architecture. \nMake sure you have all the dependencies shown in the gnome-ppp page already installed in your system. Most probably you need to download and install wvdial, other dependencies should already there. Download the .deb file for wvdial also, if not pre-installed on your system.\nTo check a package/dependency is installed in your system, run the following command in terminal,\ndpkg -l | grep <packagename>\n\nFor example, to check wvdial is there or not use,\ndpkg -l | grep wvdial\n\nIf you have it on your system the output will be like,\nii    wvdial    1.61-4build1    intelligent Point-to-Point Protocol dialer\n\nBefore you proceed to install check all the dependencies are installed in your system (if not you need to download each of them from the above site and install).\nInstallation: \nFirst you need to install the dependency(s). Then gnome-ppp itself. To install a package run in terminal,\nsudo dkpg -i /path/to/<packagename.deb>\n\nHope this will be helpful.\n", "Q: Partition Disks on VirtualBox When installing Ubuntu Server Which option should I select in the 'Partition disks' screen when installing Ubuntu Server 12.04 x64 on an Oracle VirtualBox? \nOptions are:  \n\nGuided - resize SCSI3 (0,0,0), partition #5 (sda) and use freed space  \nGuided - use entire disk   \nGuided - use entire disk and set up LVM   \nGuided - use entire disk and set up encrypted LVM  \nManual\n\nI selected Guided - use entire disk and set up LVM but then got this scary message: Note that all data on the disk you select will be erased, but not before you have confirmed that you really want to make the changes.\nI'm assuming it's only referring to the virtual hard drive and not the real hard drive on my computer. Just want to confirm. \n\nA: Yes,its just refferring your virtual hard drive and not the real hard-drive.It doesn't affect your main hard-drive,i'm sure about that.\n", "Q: Efficient way to copy multiple files using the GUI I have a simple use case. I want o copy some music. I have an 8Gb pen drive and my Music folder where each album is a directory inside the artist name directory. I select some artists. I select a couple of albums and dragn'drop them. Select some more, and copy again. The file manager almost freezes.\nThe problem is that Ubuntu tries to copy them simultaneously, instead of just queueing them. This parallel writing is extremely slow.  \nYes, I could ctrl select every one and do just one dragn'drop action, but my experience is that I'd make a wrong click and undo all my selection. \nI didn't think that it would be a problem in 2013.\n\nA: I'm sure this a general Linux/Unix behavior since the same thing will happen on a Mac. (Pretty sure it happens with Windows as well.) Every file copy operation is independent and added to the I/O queue and the OS will attempt to execute them simultaneously rather than sequentially even if the destination is the same. Going to a USB device can exacerbate the situation even further since the data throughput is considerably slower than the hard drive; then add the overhead of maintaining the directory information on the USB drive with multiple I/O executions running and it just bogs.\nStick with the Control-click route: if you make a mistake, Control-click the mis-selected file again and it will de-select it.\n", "Q: Ubuntu 13.10 graphics issue causes blank screen and prevents install I have not been able to install Ubuntu on my HP Envy 17 because the computer boots to the startup screen, but the screen goes blank during install.\nI am wondering if there is a distro that has the HP Intel Graphics 4400 driver installed. Could I get an ISO with that embedded in it? There is a driver for the card, however I can't figure out how to put it on the install CD.\nZorin is the flavor that I'm trying to install, but Ubuntu works the same way even after using nomodeset.\n\nA: If you look carefully, can you see the logon dialog on the black screen?  I've had a similar issue with this chipset and is was down to the screen backlight not illuminating.\nIf this is the case, then at the initial grub boot loader, select the kernel that you intend to boot (probably only one of those if this is an initial install) and press 'e'.  This allows you to edit your boot options.  Scroll down to the line that begins with 'linux' and press the 'End' key (or use the cursor keys to move to the end).  Add a space followed by 'acpi_backlight=vendor' (no quotes, single underscore between acpi and backlight) and boot by pressing F10 or Ctl-X.\nHopefully, that will work.  If so, you need to edit your boot configuration to make this permanent.\n", "Q: After trying to get ubuntu 13.10 to recognize windows 8 install windows 8 won't boot I was trying to dual boot Ubuntu 13.10 alongside Windows 8 using a LiveUSB but when attempting to install Ubuntu, it didn't recognize my Windows 8 install. \nI did a couple things trying to get it to recognize it from this link and also tried zapping GPT structures as well. I believe when I zapped the GPT structures, bad things happened. \nNow Windows 8 will not boot but says it needs to be repaired. It references the winload.efi file missing or something. \nI tried making a Windows recovery USB, but it is unable to refresh because the drive is locked, and it will not reset because a required drive partition is missing. \nI never ended up going through with the Ubuntu install just to make sure everything else stayed put. I can see all my old files and all the old partitions are still there.\nHow can I fix this?\n\nA: Can you please run GParted in Ubuntu and post a screenshot of the partitions (through a link to dropbox or something)?\n\nA: Zapping the GPT data structures was almost certainly a mistake. The reference to winload.efi makes me think you had an EFI-booting Windows installation. If your computer came with Windows 8 pre-installed, this is further evidence of an EFI-bootable Windows. Such an installation would require GPT, so by zapping the GPT data, you've erased your partition information.\nIf this hypothesis is correct, your best bet is to use a tool like TestDisk to recover your partitions. That said, posting your partition information (what you get when you type sudo parted /dev/sda print or sudo gdisk -l /dev/sda in an Ubuntu Terminal window) will give more information about the current state of your disk. It's conceivable that something less radical and risky than using TestDisk will fix the problem.\n", "Q: Keyboard backlight not working Clevo P170SM I just installed Ubuntu 13.10 and I cant figure out how to turn on the keyboard backlight.

Nautilus seems to be a normally fine answer for permissions questions so I'm stumped. Presumably login in as root instead of gksudo would not mean Nautilus could find it any better. Any ideas how to delete this folder? Thanks again in advance.\n\nA: It probably doesn't show in Nautilus because you're in the /root, the root user's \"home directory\" of sorts, and not your own home directory. Use gksudo nautilus /home/$USER/Desktop and you'll see it then.\nIf not, open up a terminal and type sudo rm -rfv ~/Desktop/Documents. (The command will permanently delete the file; I only advise it because you say you have a sure backup of the data elsewhere and you really don't need that folder/file.)\nThe problem is that when you copied the file there, the program or command you used was being run as root and therefore the file belongs to root.

For this purpose I've installed gnupg and use the graphical interface seahorse. By selecting a new PGP-Key in seahorse I generate a new key. What I'm curiose about is the following: The generate key, is this just the private one?\n \nand here the details about that key\n\nIs it correct, that I just created a private key? If so, how do I create now a suitable public one?\n\nA: You already have a public key\nYou will always generate a keypair. It's a public and private key shown as one entry. As you can always derive a public key from a private one, anyway.\nWhat Seahorse and GPG does is just listing keys and only denote you can use to sign/decrypt using those keys if there's a private key available for those. Once you import other's public keys you will see those are listed as public-only keys, only available for encryption and signature validation.\n\nAs you can see, Seahorse will display keypairs as a two-key icon whereas for keys only a public key is present it will show a single key.\nTo verify this on the command line, use\ngpg --list-keys\n\nThis prints all keys in the keyring, regardless of private key availability.\ngpg --list-secret-keys\n\nPrints all keys for which a private (secret) key is available.\n", "Q: Half/quarter of the native resolution on a MacBook with Retina display I have a MacBook Pro notebook with native resolution of 2560x1600 which makes all my desktop details unreadable.

If you want to use linux tools from the repositories, you need to use the kernel provided by Ubuntu. Linux tools checks your kernel version and if it don't match it's own it will not run.\n\nA: On ubuntu \"perf\" is a shell script that calls a kernel specific perf binary.\nBut that's not actually needed, perf is compatible.

Recall that Python is an interpreted language (like PHP, Ruby, etc.) and just processes the contents of that file, rather than executing it; python is the executable here!\nFor proper background information; note that you can run scripts two ways:\n\n*\n\n*Calling the interpreter with the file as input/argument does not require other than read permissions, e.g.:\n python myscript.py\n\n\n\n*Run the script by its shebang does require the executable bit set, because it would start a new process, the Python interpreter.\n ./myscript.py\n\nThe shebang (first line in the file) should then be something like\n #!/usr/bin/env python\n\nto define the interpreter for this file.\nN.B. Such a shebang line is also a comment in Python when run in the former form (and thus ignored), so it would work both ways. Could be useful for users in case a different interpreter version is desired for a single run, e.g. python3.10 myscript.py if you don't like the default python. That's why you'll probably see the latter form to be fairly common in any entrypoint/script.\n\nA: \"python only needs read permission\" to read the content of your file and process the code.\nyour user can execute python. then python can read file (because of 400). If you want to execute file directly like \" ./testo.py \" then you need a execute permissions of your file. \n", "Q: Wifi Hostspot setup for Cable Modem Connection I have a broadband connection through my ISP (Hathway), using a cable modem.

There are three versions available and I want to have all three; stable, testing and nightly. I downloaded and compiled the source code for all three with no problems. The issue is when I want to compile a new version. When I extract the tar.xz file into /usr/lib/games/openttd-trunk/ the old files aren't overwritten. Instead, a new directory is created called openttd-trunk-r26175.\nIs there any way to extract the files from the archive directly into /usr/lib/games/openttd-trunk/? That way I can just simply make without having to ./configure every time.\nEDIT: I don't think I made clear that the archive has the source files inside a single folder called openttd-trunk-r26175. What I want to do is extract all files from that folder, but not the folder itself.\n\nA: See this answer.\nIf you archive has one top level folder you can use --strip-components 1, to remove first folder from full files path.\nFinaly, this should do what you want:\ntar xf openttd-trunk-r26175.tar -C /usr/lib/games/openttd-trunk/ --strip-components 1\n\n\nA: You can use the --strip-components tar argument to remove leading directory components, and use the -C option to specify a target location for the resulting files e.g.\ntar xvf openttd-trunk.tar.xz --strip-components=1 -C /usr/lib/games/openttd-trunk/\n\n\nA: \nI don't think I made clear that the archive has the source files inside a single folder called openttd-trunk-r26175. What I want to do is extract all files from that folder, but not the folder itself\n\nI think you might want to try out the dtrx extractor.\nsudo apt-get install dtrx\n\nIn that situation what you mentioned dtrx asks for you to decide what to do? From its manpage:\n\nNormally,  if  an  archive only contains one file or directory with a name that doesn't match the archive's, dtrx will ask you how to handle\n                it.\n\n          Extract the file/directory inside another directory named after the archive.  This is the default.\n\n          Extract the file/directory in the current directory, and then rename it to match the name of the archive.\n\n          Extract the file/directory in the current directory.\n\nIt also has the -o option to overwrite a present directory if you want that. So the command what you need is likely:\ndtrx -o --one rename openttd-trunk.tar.xz\n\n(Of course this can be achieved in other ways too, but dtrx is kinda handy program so you might want to try it out.)\n", "Q: Is a block size of 4 MiB on a partition of 99.06 GiB too big?

Ubuntu 12.04 LTS provides OpenSSL 1.0.1e, but it disables TLSv1.1 and TLSv1.2. In the past it was an interop decision because of broken client implementations. In 2014, its really not appropriate since the clients have had time to fix their broken-ness. Any remaining broken clients are penalizing the majority of complying clients.\nI want to provide the same version of OpenSSL 1.0.1e, but I want to provide the [currently] disabled protocols. I know I can create a Personal Package Archive (PPA), but its not clear to me if I can use it to override a Ubuntu base package.\n(I also realize statically linked clients will not benefit from the improved packaging).\nHow does one provide an override to a specific package in Ubuntu?\n\nA: Yes, you can provide packages in a PPA that will install over top the standard Ubuntu packages. However, you will have to take the time to keep the packages up to date whenever new versions are released into Ubuntu. You may also want to check that it is still not enabled in the packages in Trusty as well. If it's already enabled in Trusty, then when 14.04 LTS is released in April 2014, it might be better to just upgrade. If it's not already enabled, you might want to discuss with the Ubuntu security team, about getting it enabled, by filing a bug report, and subscribing them to it.\nYou can  do it by fixing the version number. For example, if the current version in Ubuntu is 1.0.1e-0ubuntu1, then you'll want to specify your version as 1.0.1e-0ubuntu1.1~12.04.1 for building in your PPA. Appending the .1~12.04.1 makes it higher than the current Ubuntu version, but lower than the next Ubuntu version (so that if there is a security update in Ubuntu, it will take precedence). The 12.04 portion specifies it's built for 12.04, and the final .1 is your build number (in case you make a mistake and need to rebuild the same package, you can bump this to .2 for example). You will also need to specify the appropriate release series code name in the debian/changelog file as precise for 12.04, though if building off the existing 12.04 packages, on 12.04, should be set by default already.\n", "Q: What's the best practice for backing up encrypted Ubuntu home dir? After installing Ubuntu 12.04 and electing to encrypt my entire home directory, I am now wondering what the best way would be to back up the data here. \nI backed up the rest of my file system with the command\ntar -cvpjf sysbackup.tar.bz2 --exclude=/sysbackup.tar.bz2 \n--exclude=/sysbackup.log --exclude=/home --one-file-system / 1> sysbackup.log\n\n(and the boot/efi partition in a similar way), but I am unsure what do about the /home/user directory.\nOption 1) Backup the encrypted /home/.encryptfs/$USER/.Private and /home/.encryptfs/$USER/.encryptfs  dirs. Then in the future, in case of disaster, recover it to access files with sudo ecryptfs-recover-private, as detailed  here, from a live-CD. With the rest of my system backup, I could format and partition as before with gParted, then restore /, /home/.encryptfs/$USER/.Private and /home/.encryptfs/$USER/.encryptfs. Downside: possibly no tar compression, and probably no way to exclude subdirs.\nOption 2) When I log in, the home dir is mounted with all files unencrypted automatically, so presumably I could simply make a tar of everything here (the .encryptfs and .Private in /home/$USER are just symlinks to the real encrypted data at /home/.encryptfs/$USER/...I think they may have something to with launching the auto-mount on login? So I won't include these in backup)\nThe problem I see with Option 2) in the event of system failure, it might not be possible just to format and partition the disk from the live-CD, restore / and then simply restore /home/$USER because now /home/.encryptfs would be missing, so this might lead to issues, with Ubuntu expecting encrypted home and trying to unexcrypt and mount the private directories normally in /home/.encryptfs but not finding these..\n(A secondary downside would be the tar is not stored in encrypted form, although gpg or deja dup could solve that concern anyway).\nWhat I'm really asking is: if the system died, and I had to boot up via a live CD, format my linux partition and get out my backup, let's say it's on a USB stick, would I be able to simply mount the partion to /media/whatever extract everything excluding home from the backup of /  ( via sudo tar -xvpzf /media/USB/path/to/backup.tar.gz -C /media/whatever --numeric-owner), then create a /media/whatever/home/$USER and simply copy all my plain-text home dir there...and then reboot and get a system as it always was, or would the fact that I previously had an encrypted home dir cause some issue upon reboot? would something in the way encryptfs start to complain (and maybe not load my home dir properly), or would things be totally fine? \nI suppose this is equivalent to if right now I just deleted my encrypted /home/$USER and /home/.encryptfs dirs (after unmounting on another user acc etc etc) then recreated my /home/$USER contents with the plain text files..I tried this experiment on a virtual machine and everything seemed to go through just fine, so I think encryptfs would not mess things up...(perhaps so long as the symlinks in the home dir are gone?)\n\nA: Option 1 is generally recommended.  You don't get compression, but you can exclude sub-directories.  It it can be a pain to figure out how the names have been mangled, but the directory hierarchy is preserved.\nYou do need to practice recovering from this or any other backup scheme, and the advice at How to safely back up the \"Private\" folder? is good on  how to test that out.\nOption 2 means you have to do something to protect the backup data.\n", "Q: Installation ubuntu 12.04 64 bit on notebook toshiba : no root file system is defined When I run installation of Ubuntu 12.04 LTS on my notebook Toshiba Intel core i5, 6mb RAM, 500 Gb. \nI receive a message of \"no root file system is defined\"\nWhat can I do? \n\nA: It appears to me you are not selecting a proper mount point during the installation for root ( \"/\" ). \nMake sure you select and assign all the mountpoints according to your needs.\n\n\nA mount point is a directory (typically an empty one) in the currently accessible\n    filesystem on which an additional filesystem is mounted (i.e., logically attached). \n\n\nQuote from http://www.linfo.org/mount_point.html\n", "Q: Ubuntu for Tablet PC Artists?

I have a newer WD 2 TB external USB HD with all of my media on it. \nI can not for the life of me figure out why Plex will not recognize the files on this hard drive. It shows the external as there, Ubuntu shows the files and allows me to play them, view them, etc. Plex shows the name \"External\". \nBut when I click it, it is 100% empty and shows nothing to add. I can access the files on the external through file sharing just fine, on my windows computers but would love to be able to use Plex for streaming with our Roku. \nI am fairly new to Ubuntu, I have used Plex with the same HD on Windows and it worked fine. I have read multiple articles on this and nothing seems to be doing the trick. \nHow can I solve this?\n\nA: You need to configure fstab to set the proper permissions.\nThere is a whole page about how to do this on the Plex site, see:\nhttps://support.plex.tv/hc/en-us/articles/200288606-Mounting-NTFS-Drives-on-Linux\nTo make it short:\n\n\n*\n\n*Find the UUID of your drive:\nsudo blkid | grep ntfs\n\n*create a directory where you will mount the drive:\nsudo mkdir /media/ext_NTFS_USB_Drive\n\n*edit file  /etc/fstab with command: \ngksu gedit /etc/fstab\n\n*add a line to this file and save.\nUUID=485CBF485CBF3014 /media/ext_NTFS_USB_Drive ntfs-3g permissions,auto 0 0\nwhere the UUID is the one your drive and the mount point is the folder you created.\n\n*now mount the drive:\nsudo mount /media/ext_NTFS_USB_Drive\n(you might get an error saying the drive is already mounted, in Nautilus for example. Just unmount it - Safely Remove Drive, or click the Eject Icon in Nautilus)\nNow in Plex, you need to change the location of the media folder you were trying to add to somewhere inside: /media/ext_NTFS_USB_Drive\n\nA: Try adding Plex to the plugdev group.\nOpen a terminal (Press ControlAltT) and enter \nsudo gpasswd -a plex plugdev\nVerify that plex was added to the plugdev group by entering:\ngroups plex\nwhich should display what groups plex belongs too. Next, reboot the computer and start plex to verify this corrected the problem.\n\nA: It's the folder mount point of your extern hdd that's giving trouble.\nIt hasn't got the right  rights, the easiest way to change this without terminal commands except opening nautilus as root goes as follows:\nopen nautilus with sudo:\nsudo nautilus (or any other system browser opened with root)\nhover over your extern hd with the mouse arrow to see the full path of your hd, or click on it and then press Ctrl+l to see the full path in the adress bar.\nexample: /media/nick/extern_hdd1\nextern_hdd1 is mounted to the folder nick, go to media to change the  permissions of the folder nick, to do this press ctrl+l and paste /media/ in the address bar or browse to media manually.\nright click on the folder nick go to properties and change the following:\nOwner         : nick (in your own case your own user name)\nFolder access : Create and delete files\nFile Access   : ---\nGroup         : plugdev\nFolder Access : Access files\nFile Access   : ---\nOthers\nFolder Access : Access files\nFile Access   : ---\nThat's it!\n\nA: You have to make sure that the user plex has access not only to the drive, but the folder that the drive is mounted in. After a lot of tinkering I wound up going this route:\nEdit the Mount Options (Disks -> \"More Actions\" (the two gears under the \"Volumes\" map) -> Edit Mount Options) such that:\nnosuid,nodev,nofail\n\nis in the area for storing the options in the /etc/fstab file (the textbox under \"Symbolic Icon Name\")\nand set the Mount Point to be:\n/media/<user>/<HDD Name>\n\nand remount your HDD so that it will appear in the specified location.\n\nNext, add yourself to the plex user group by going to the Terminal and enter:\nsudo adduser \"$USER\" plex\n\nNow, you can modify the ownership of the relevant files and directory so that they are owned by ${USER}:plex. You can give plex read-access to the drive by going to the Terminal and enter:\nsudo chgrp plex \"/media/${USER}/\"\nsudo chmod g+rX \"/media/${USER}/\"\n\nsudo chgrp plex \"/media/${USER}\"/<HDD Name>/\nsudo chmod g+rX \"/media/${USER}\"/<HDD Name>/\n\nIt may also be necessary to ensure that ACL permissions are properly configured, so the following might also be necessary:\nsudo setfacl -m g:plex:rx /media/<user>/\n\n\nFYI: If a file/directory displays a + symbol as part of its permissions (e.g. drwxr-xr-x+) that means that ACL controls are active for that file/directory.\n\n\nNow that Plex has access to the drive, you need to make sure that it has access to all files in the relevant directories. This can be done by repeating the following for all of your media library folders:\nchmod -R g+rX /media/<user>/<HDD Name>/<Library Folder>\n\nThis solved my issues for the two extra drives I've added to my HTPC. Hope it helps.\nPS: As @douggro mentioned, Plex has a good article on the subject, but they changed up the structure of their site, so it took me a while to find it from his link, so here's a more current link to the page: Plex Linux Permissions Guide\n\nA: Maybe this was different back when posted ;Using ubuntu 18.04 lts; had to run\nsudo systemctl edit plexmediaserver\n\nAdded 2 lines there\n[Service]\nUser=user-that-can-access-media-mount\nGroup=group-of-user-above\n\nThen\nsudo chown -R user-that-can-access-media-mount:group-of-user-above /var/lib/plexmediaserver\nThen restarted the server\nsudo service plexmediaserver restart \n\n\nA: As several people have mentioned, the issue is likely due to the plex user not having the correct permissions.  I had a similar problem, and was able to fix it using a few easy steps.\nOpen this config file:\nsudo nano /etc/default/plexmediaserver\n\nFind this line:\nPLEX_MEDIA_SERVER_USER = plex\n\nReplace plex with your username, and save the file.  Once I restarted my computer, Plex was able to access the folders on the external drive.\nYou may be able to run sudo mount -a and/or sudo service plexmediaserver restart instead of rebooting.\nCredit: htpcguides.com\n\nA: It is most likely a permissions issue with Plex. Read this page for info on Plex permissions. Also consider creating a folder on the external dedicated to your media then creating a mount point for it in your fstab entries, mounting it as the user plex.\n\nA: I fixed my problem by just removing the user out of the line. I was under root in gedit, in the etc/fstab. I noticed that I could play videos on another drive and it was mounted as /media/HHD. So I just removed the user and the rebooted and now Playing the Moive Cars for my 3 yr old\nUUID=528A041A7B1FE95D   /media/user/Movies_2TiB ntfs-3g\n\nSo it looks like\nUUID=528A041A7B1FE95D   /media/Movies_2TiB  ntfs-3g\n\nI've been reading and trying things for two days now .. but how simple this was. \nI hope that this helps someone out there and saves them time.\n\nA: I don't know what's going on, but the only thing that helped me with ext4 drive was setting in \"Disks\" app \"Automatic Mount Options\" - \"OFF\" and setting \"Mount Point\" \"/mnt/foobar\" instead of \"/media/username/foobar\".\n\nA: The chmod worked for me and I am using a vfat and an ntfs drive both and they both work great now, thanks for the advice. This is the 2 lines from my fstab drive, just replace the <....> with the correct drive info:\nUUID=<Drive ID> /media/<user>/<NewVolume1>  ntfs-3g permissions,auto,nosuid,nodev,nofail    0   0\n\nUUID=EEBB-75D5 /media/<user>/<NewVolume1>   vfat    defaults,uid=1000,gid=1000,nosuid,nodev,nofail  0   0\n\n\nA: After struggling with this problem I found an extremely simple solution. I installed and ran a program called ntfs-config. Plex could then read the contents of my two ntfs drives, one external and the other internal with only two clicks per drive.\n\nA: Finally I used Menu → Preferences → Disks to compare properties of the two drives.  Only one difference was under Edit mount options…  The internal SSD was set to manual mount options with the Mount at Start-up box checked.  The USB drive was set to automatic mount options with the box unchecked.\n\nA: Navigate to the media folder by typing this in the terminal\ncd /media/\n\nThen type\nsudo chmod 777 <user>\n\nEnter the admin password.\nYou are good to go. Now try to access the folders in the external HDD from plex.\nNote : \n<user>\n\nis the folder name found inside the media folder. (when you navigate to cd /media/ in the terminal)\n\nA: The only solution working for me :\nYou need to change the user for the Plex Media Server, instead of the user \"plex\" you must use your linux user.\nsudo vim /etc/default/plexmediaserver (or use nano instead of vim)\nPLEX_MEDIA_SERVER_USER=yourLinuxUser\n\nsudo mkdir /plex\n\nsudo chmod -R 777 $USER:$USER /plex\n\nsudo chown -R $USER:$USER /plex\n\nPlace all your media files and folders in /plex\nIt should now work immediately. For me it does. If not restart your computer.\n\nA: I was still facing issues using 18.04; \nSo I installed Eiciel *(ACL program)\nI found that because I had older installs of OS's that had the same username, I had to add all the duplicates. Once done, the change to their plexmediaserver.service file worked; \n\nA: I did not have to edit any files or change my drive content permissions, or give plex access to my user account. All I ended up doing is making a new folder under /media called \"plex\" so it was /media/plex, and gave it permissions plex:plex as follows:\ncd /media\nsudo mkdir plex\nsudo chown plex:plex plex\n\nThen, I listed my drives to see the device so I could mount it to the plex folder:\nsudo blkid -o list\n\nThe above command showed that my ext4-formatted external drive happened to be on /dev/sdb1, so I mounted it as follows:\nsudo mount -t ext4 -o defaults /dev/sdb1 /media/plex\n\nThat mounted the drive to /media/plex. My movies are inside of that drive under another sub-folder called movies, so all the files are actually in:\n/media/plex/movies\n\nAnyways, I went back into Plex and added the library, it let me click on the /movie/plex folder no problem, it even found the sub-folders and everything worked perfectly, it detected all the movies! \nNo need to reboot or restart the server or anything. \nI'm on Ubuntu Studio 18.04.2 LTS using Plex Media Server 1.15.4.994.\n\nA: Just run this command first:\n/mnt$ sudo chown :plex sda1/\n\nthen:\ncd to sda1 and do: \n/mnt/sda1$ sudo chown -R :plex *\n\nName your asset folders files as /folder/file as in movie-name (year)/movie-name (year).mp4  And for TV to be detected use series-name (year)/series-name S01E01 (year).mp4\n\nA: Not sure if this is the most secure way of doing it but other attempts failed, this works:\nsudo usermod -a -G pi plex\nsudo usermod -a -G plugdev plex\nsudo chmod 775 /media/pi\n\n", "Q: Gitlab Debian Package I need to install GitLab in my ubuntu 12.04 64-bit\nFound the following link but it doesn't work for me.\nWe need it to be a debian package to simplify installation in my company network\nI know there is a bitnami installer but I don't like it (no trust with 3rd party)\nNote: I don't want to accumulate scripts!

The Windows install manager says it can't install on a GPT drive I installed Ubuntu(64) on a partition of my 1TB drive. I left 200gb formatted on NTFS to install Windows 7(64) later and 600gb of free space. When I get to the part of selecting the partition to install Win7 it says it's not possible to install it on a GPT drive. I just finished building the PC today so the first thing I installed was Ubuntu. Can anybody help me with this ?\nedit: It seems that it's relevant whether the system is UEFI or not. My mobo is UEFI.\n\nA: Windows 7 can only boot on GPT drives if the computer is running UEFI, make sure your motherboards UEFI isn't running in legacy CPM (BIOS Compatibility Mode For Legacy OSs). If your hardware is very new it likely uses the new revision of UEFI that Windows 8 is designed for, alas Windows 7 uses on older revision and will not boot on systems that have the new revision of UEFI. Alternatively you can format your hard drive as MBR and set your UEFI to function in legacy CPM mode (BIOS), then reinstall Ubuntu and Windows 7 happily. \nThe other possibility is that if you did not create an FAT32 (EFI BOOT) partition, that could alternatively be causing the problem, as windows requires that parition for writing EFI boot information to rather than an MBR Boot sector, you can create this parition yourself from ubuntu, just make sure to flag it as boot and place it as the 1st parition on the drive. Windows also sometimes gets pissy if you don't let it create an MSR partition.\nYou should start entering your UEFI and checking the settings to see if it's running in CPM mode or not.\nOnce you make sure it's not running in CPM mode then erase your hard drive, Install windows 7, then shrink the windows partition using Gparted on an Ubuntu live cd, then install ubuntu in the free space.\n\nA: Installing Windows 7 in EFI mode requires booting the boot disc in EFI mode. This can be tricky sometimes, but it is possible. You may need to use your firmware's built-in boot manager (usually accessible by pressing Esc or some random function key early in the boot process) and selecting the boot option for the boot medium that includes the string \"EFI\" or \"UEFI\". There are lots of Web sites that go into more detail about this, such as this one. (Try a Web search for more; that one was just the first site that came up when I did such a search.)\nBefore you do anything, though, it's imperative that you determine your Linux boot mode. If Linux is booting in EFI/UEFI mode, you should try to install Windows in EFI/UEFI mode. If Linux is booting in BIOS/CSM/legacy mode, though, you've got a dilemma, because Windows won't install in this mode to a GPT disk, although Linux will. Thus, you'll need to decide whether to convert your disk from GPT to MBR to accommodate a BIOS-mode boot of both OSes or to install an EFI boot loader for Linux so as to let both OSes boot from the GPT disk in EFI mode.\n", "Q: How can a touchscreen be made to disable temporarily while an active digitiser is in use? I have a ThinkPad Yoga which features both a capacitive touchscreen and a Wacom digitiser. I can disable the touchscreen manually (using something such as xinput disable <id> in a command activated by a Unity launcher icon), but I would prefer a more automated approach. Samsung devices such as the Galaxy Note 3 and 8 (which feature touchscreens and Wacom digitisers together also) disable the touchscreen whenever the active digitiser is active (i.e., near the screen).

I am new to Ubuntu. I formerly used to use python on windows, and now I am learning Ubuntu. When I open the command terminal, I type python and press Enter,the symbol (>>>) is shown and I am in IDLE. However, I want to know how I can create functions and classes and the stuff I used to to in Windows. \nThanks.\n\nA: Creating functions using the CLI is very similar to creating functions in scripts. Type your function name and arguments on the first line and append a colon. After that the Pyhton interpreter asks for further input. Now you have to indent the next code you want write in the function body. You finish the function the a blank line. \nIt should look like:\n>>> def fun(a,b):\n...     print a,b\n... \n>>> \n\n\nA: \nThe difference is: in windows you can go to file-->new module and create what you want\n\nI think what you mean is, that in Windows you're used to the IDLE GUI. In Ubuntu you'll have to install the necessary packages in order to run the Tkinter version of IDLE.\nInstalling the idle  package will make sure you have all the necessary software to run the GUI.\nThen run it:\nidle\n\nAnd it's also in your regular applications list.\n", "Q: All my virtual host go to the same site?

Computer:\nDell Inspiron 1420\nIntel Core 2 Duo T5550 (3GB, DDR2, 667mHz)\nRunning Dual Boot with Windows Vista and now Ubuntu 12.04\nFirstly, I'm not very Linux/Ubuntu savvy -- once things work I get it, but I'm not good at installing things or editing files... i.e. I need very specific instructions. \nI've been using Ubuntu 8.04 forever and love it -- I've had my computer for over 5 years and it runs just as fast today as when I got it. But since 8.04 isn't supported anymore and I was having small issues like video in Firefox, and Firefox not updating I figured it was time to update and I just figured the most recent would be best. So I updated to 10.4 then 12.04.\nNow I cannot connect to the internet in 12.04. I believe I could in 10.4. I've restarted a couple times and it says upon restarting \"Waiting for network configuration.\" When I go into System Settings / Network there is immediately a message that reads \"The system network services are not compatible with this version.\" \nI also don't understand 12.04, I don't know where Administration and the other drop down menu below it moved to, when I right click on a folder it doesn't give me the options 8.04 gave me.\nI do like the look, the new menu bar and the workspace switcher.... so if I could somehow get the internet working and understand the basics and how it changed from 8.04, I would like to keep it.\nNot sure if I can save 12.04, or if I should revert back to 10.4 and try that, and if so the best way to do that. I did back up all my files (not programs)... any advice would be much appreciated.\n\nA: You shouldn't revert back to an older version, because that would mean no security updates, which is very bad.\nInstead, I recommend making sure your backups worked properly, then do a fresh install of ubuntu 12.04 (rather than an upgrade).\nMy experience is that upgrading from old ubuntu releases tended to leave some weird config files in place that cause lots of small problems, and a fresh install avoids that. It's not nearly as much of a problem in the last few ubuntu releases, so once you get a working 12.04, future upgrades should work fine. \n", "Q: Create new document?

You are seeing the nearby wireless accesspoints, so may not be a driver problem. Also check the router protocols like TKIP, and or AES (CCMP) and WPA2 personal settings.\n", "Q: Gear menu - switch account doesn't work Running Ubuntu 13.10.\nI open the gear menu, and see a list of users. Clicking on them does nothing. Shouldn't it allow me to switch accounts?\nFollow up: If I am logged in as a user that doesn't have a password set, and I want to switch to a different user (without log out), it seems that I don't have a way to do this. The \"Lock/Switch account\" just causes the screen to go black for a second and then back in to the current user.\n\nA: What you are trying to do is impossible. When you try to switch user from the drop-down menu in the gear indicator on the menu bar, the system needs to authenticate the user's identity and right to perform the action. It does so in a way that ultimately relies on the information in /etc/passwd. \nThis fails since the user does not have a password set and returns you to the current user. You may be able to switch the user by different means that use a different internal process, but it may be easiest to set a password for the user in question.\n", "Q: Does a dual boot with Windows make Ubuntu more prone to \"breaking\"? I've been using Ubuntu as my primary OS on my laptop, but I've been forced to dual boot it with Windows because sometimes I'm required to use software that only works on Windows. I've had a fair share of problems with Ubuntu (things like invalid arch independent ELF magic, etc.) using this setup. Is the number of problems Ubuntu has somehow related to Windows' presence?\n\nA: Depends what the problem is but very unlikely, as the partitions are separate. I'll assume you installed windows and then installed linux, as it doesn't work so gracefully the other way around with the windows boot loader.\n", "Q: Dual Booting tips (ASUS 1015e-DS02) I have an ASUS 1015e-ds02 which has ubuntu 10.4 preinstalled.

Any tips or advice would be greatly appreciated!

Why is that different?\n\nA: The number 0800 in hexadecimal form converts to 2048 in decimal form.\nThe command to convert a hexadecimal number to decimal is:\necho \"ibase=16; hex-number\"|bc\n\nRunning the command: \necho \"ibase=16; 0800\"|bc\n\nReturns the result: 2048\n", "Q: Windows 8 Install No Disc/USB I absolutely abhor Windows 8.\nI wanted to install Ubuntu, so I downloaded it and it took me to a bundle of folders.

If you don't want that, then you would have to make a copy of the idle.desktop file in the same directory (/usr/share/applications/ or ~/.local/share/applications/) , name it e.g idle.other.desktop, and modify the Exec line in that one, and also add a new line with the following content:\nNoDisplay=true\n\nThen modify your mimeapps.list file, so the text/x-python= line reads:\ntext/x-python=idle.other.desktop;\n\n", "Q: Language problem is causing updatting problem!

The other computers connecting to your newly created WiFi network are not getting IP addresses, and thus are not able to get connected.\nThus you have to install & enable a DHCP server on your ubuntu machine.\nsudo apt-get install dnsmasq\n\nand then configure it sudo nano /etc/dnsmasq.conf by adding the following lines in the \"interface\" section:\ninterface=wlan0\ndhcp-range=192.168.0.100,192.168.0.250,72h\n\nAfter this, your clients should get a IP address when connecting to the newly created WiFi network, and then the connection should be forwarded to the internet.\n\nA: Try ap-hotspot, which is a convenient wrapper around hostapd.\n", "Q: Need Help Installing Steam With Wine (Bug) When I try to install steam with wine and winetricks, its only says :\nChecksum for /home/viktor/.cache/winetricks/steam/SteamInstall.msi did not match, retrying download\n\nAnd :\nsha1sum mismatch!

Which would you recomend?\nThanks in advance.\n\nA: If you want to have stability and long-term support choose 12.04. You can upgrade it to 14.04 next year if you want to - that will be an LTS as well.\n13.10 is not a long-term support release. It is like a stepping stone on the way to 14.04.\nLTS releases come every two years and they are always even numbered and released in April, hence the '04' bit. So 10.04, 12.04, 14.04, when it is released, are all LTS.\nOther releases are more about introducing newer techniques and sub-systems into ubuntu as part of the development process.\nsource\nOverall, if you're thinking of moving from Ubuntu 12.04.2 LTS to Ubuntu 13.10 on the basis of better performance, that's true if you're using the open-source Intel/Radeon/Nouveau graphics drivers..\n", "Q: Black screen after installing the ATI driver I'm new to the Linux world but decided to try Ubuntu and so far I like it. \nBut after installing the ATI driver a weird thing occured.

I try to change it, but the problem is \"choose server\" button is disabled and can't be used. So, the only option for me was to click on \"cancel\" button or to close the window which means I gave up. What is the problem here, why I can't change the source for update and how to do that?\n\nA: After you get to the country you want, you need to click on the little arrow to the left of the country name. That will open up the list of servers available int that country.  \nHere is a screenshot of the United States list opened, note the arrow on the left is pointed down as the list has been opened.\n\nAll you would need to do is to click on one of the listed servers and then box will be enabled and you can choose the server.\nThe Software Sources has a built in feature that will test all the servers and select the best one for your location.  That will allow you to use the best server for you without having to test everyone manually.  If you look at the upper right hand corner of the screenshot, you will see the button Select Best Server.  Just click that and the test will start and find you the best server.

It cant get into root-only spaces, so it can't tally all data. Try sudo du.\ndu measures each file while df reports the free/taken space. It reports everything, but can be thrown off by bad files, missing sectors, etc. It measures the PHYSICAL free space, not the space you can use.\nWhenever checking a hard drive, use du.\nSRC: Why do \"df\" and \"du\" commands show different disk usage?\n\nA: du: Displays the file system block usage for each file argument and for each directory in the file hierarchy rooted in each directory argument.ManPage \ndf:  Displays free disk space, With no arguments, df reports the space used and available on all currently mounted filesystems (of all types). Otherwise, df reports on the filesystem containing each argument file.

Use this diagram:\n(Your HDD) -> (Your Dynamic HDD) -> Pacman File\nA dynamic Hard Disk Drive is a very useful device, which replaced the fixed virtual hard drive. The Dynamic HDD is a file that contains your VM's hard drive. However, it doesn't use all n gigabytes of space you assigned it. That n is a cap, the most  space it can take up. In your case, n = 200 GB. Your virtual machine considers this as a 200 GB drive plugged in to it. As space is used in the VM, the same amount of space is used in the file. For example, your VM shows you are using 190 GB of hard drive space. The Dynamic file will also be around 190 GB. The dynamic HDD will reach its cap with the addition of 10 GB.\nThere are 3 ways to increase the actual drive size (The Host Machine):\n\n\n*\n\n*Go out any buy a new one.\n\n*Clean up unused programs, files, etc.\n\n*EMPTY THE RECYCLE BIN. You would be surprised that sometimes 50+ gb just sits in the recycle bin.\n\n\nIncreasing your dynamic HDD space (as your problem is) is rather difficult if not impossible. The easiest way would be to create a new virtual drive of a large size and start using that as a dedicated drive for development, etc. Note that this adds a second drive, and does not increase the capacity of the first. To figure out how to do this, consult your software's manual.\nYou should always keep about 5% of your hard drive free for error logs, temp files, and similar short-lived data.\n", "Q: install xdebug error I followed these steps to install xdebug on ubuntu\nDownload Latest XDebug Source file\nUnpack package, run: tar -xvzf  xdebug-2.2.3\nRun: cd xdebug-2.2.3\nRun: phpize\nRun: sudo apt-get install g++-multilib\nRun: CFLAGS=-m32 CPPFLAGS=-m32 ./configure\nRun: make\nCopy .so file to folder with extensions, run: sudo cp modules/xdebug.so /opt/lampp/lib/php/extensions/no-debug-non-zts-20090626\nEdit /opt/lampp/etc/php.ini and add the line just before [Data] line, run: sudo gedit /opt/lampp/etc/php.ini\nzend_extension = /opt/lampp/lib/php/extensions/no-debug-non-zts-20090626/xdebug.so\nRestart web server, run: sudo /opt/lampp/lampp restart\n\nBut after restarting xampp i'm getting error\n\nFailed loading\n  /opt/lampp/lib/php/extensions/no-debug-non-zts-20100525/xdebug.so: \n  /opt/lampp/lib/php/extensions/no-debug-non-zts-20100525/xdebug.so:\n  undefined symbol: zend_execute_ex\n\nI donot know what i did wrong ?\nPHP version\nphp version\n-----------\nPHP 5.5.3-1ubuntu2.1 (cli) (built: Dec 12 2013 04:24:35) \nCopyright (c) 1997-2013 The PHP Group\nZend Engine v2.5.0, Copyright (c) 1998-2013 Zend Technologies\n    with Zend OPcache v7.0.3-dev, Copyright (c) 1999-2013, by Zend Technologies\n\nphpize\n------\nConfiguring for:\nPHP Api Version:         20121113\nZend Module Api No:      20121212\nZend Extension Api No:   220121212\n\n\nA: Xdebug is in Official Ubuntu Repository\nWhen you install a package by using compiling methods it is too difficult. You should have sound knowledge in computing. \nUbuntu is not such difficult. In windows, when you right click on .exe file and select Run, you can install a application easily. Likewise in Ubuntu the equivalent for the .exe are .deb. If you right click a .deb file and select Open with Software Center, you can install the Software easily.\nIn Ubuntu, you don't need to find applications (.deb) files everywhere in internet. Most of the trusted Freely available applications are in a \"Pool\" called Ubuntu Official Repository\". When you request for install needed software, Ubuntu will download and install automatically ( If that software is in that pool). You need to do this request From the application Software Center. You have to open the application and search in it's search bar for the needed Software, select it and click on Install( Software Center has a copy of the \"pool\". So it knows available applications).\nOther method to request for the needed applications to be install is run a command in Terminal. Command is \nsudo apt-get install [PACKAGE1] ]PACKAGE2] ...\n\nThis will download the requested packages (.deb files) from the pool and install by itself. So it is so easy to install Applications in Ubuntu.\nXdebug is in the \"Pool\" or the Official Ubuntu Repository.

You just need to right click and Copy this command and then right click on terminal prompt and Paste.

I don't like it when the same physical distance traveled by the mouse results in different screen distance depending on how quickly you move the mouse.\nAlso, I would like to adjust cursor speed to my liking.\nThe problem is that Kubuntu doesn't seem to allow either:\n\nMouse acceleration cannot be set to 0 and there's not an option for mouse speed/sensitivity.\nSo, the questions are:\n\n\n*\n\n*How do I disable mouse acceleration completely?\n\n*How do I adjust mouse speed?\n\n\nA: \n  How to adjust mouse speed in KDE\n  \n*\n    \n*without enabling mouse acceleration\n    \n*and only using the settings dialog (no console, no config files)\n  \n\nThis is a colloquial summary of exhuma's answer, don't forget to upvote it.\nIn KDE, mouse acceleration is not logarithmic. That is, it has two constant mouse speeds: non-accelerated and accelerated. It switches from one to another when you jerk the mouse quickly enough.\nThe first speed is non-configurable (at least, from GUI). The second speed is configurable.\nThe solution is:\n\n\n*\n\n*Set \"Pointer threshold\" to 0. As a result, the second speed will be applied at all times. \n\n*Adjust \"Pointer acceleration\" to make that speed higher or lower.\n\n\nYou will end up with a constant, non-dynamic cursor speed adjusted to your liking.\n\nA: In this dialog, to disable the acceleration, you shouldn't set it to 0, rather set it to 1.\n", "Q: How to elevate a programs privileges on the fly?

From there, browse and select the Ubuntu file you downloaded.\nFourth: Make sure that it shows your USB drive at the bottom. Then start the installer.\nFinally: Reboot the computer. Either go into the setup and change the bios to boot from USB first, or use the one time boot menu and select USB drive. When you get to the Ubuntu Live desktop you will see an option to install Ubuntu to your computer. The installer is simple and easy to use.\nI recommend searching the Internet first and learn how to properly set up the correct amount of swap space, the correct size \"/\" partition, and the correct size \"/home\" partition. If this is your first time, you may want to let Ubuntu do it itself when the option arises. In the future, you will want a separate /home partition.

So I have a bunch of small flash drives around 4 gbs or so. 4 gbs is not enough space for me to store all my files in my persistent liveusb. So is it possible to set up multiple casper-rw partitions across multiple flash drives? So then I could plug in all my flash drives and the live system would detect the individual casper-rw partitions in the multiple flash drives and put them all together to use for space? \nI know that you can extend the casper-rw partition but since my flash drive is only 4 gbs, I cannot extend it any further. To clarify, I want to know if you can have multiple casper-rw partitions from multiple flash drives and then if the live system can automatically mount all of them and use them all for persistence. Is this possible, and if so, how can it be done?\nThanks for the help.\n\nA: There is no limit for casper-rw partition size. \nThe only limit is for the casper-rw file on a FAT32 partition. FAT32 file size limit is 4GB\nA casper-rw partition may be ext2, 3 or 4.\nBesides for a casper-rw file on a FAT32 partition you can have a home-rw file, which gives a separate home folder. \nProgram updates etc will be stored in casper-rw and home folder data will be stores in home-rw\nTo make a home-rw file rename a blank casper-rw file. \nNote that when booting a persistent Ubuntu install, the first casper-rw file or partition encountered is the one used.\nI have never found a method of combining casper-rw files but have never had a reason to.\nEDIT 2016\nAt this time, persistent partitions no longer work with syslinux type installs such as SDC or UNetbootin. They do work with a grub2 type install such as mkusb makes.\nIt is possible to use multiple casper-rw files as long as each is in a uniquely named folder on a FAT32 partition(s).\nsee:\nMultiBoot with Multiple Persistent partitions\nEDIT Aug/2017 - Persistence files > 4GB\nSyslinux started adding support for NTFS with version 4.06 but did not offer full support until version 6.03.

What are BusyBox and ash?\nI have never seen a good explanation to what they are.\nI've used ash and I know it's a Linux shell, but I would like to get a real understanding of it.\n\nA: What is busybox and how does it contain many executables within one executable?\nLet me expound upon @psusi's answer.\n@psusi said (emphasis added):\n\nBusybox is a program that implements an ash like shell, as well as a number of other common unix programs, though in a stripped down version, all in a single program...hence, why it implements many ( stripped down ) programs as single program, and then has the separate program commands symlinked to the busybox binary, which figures out which program it is supposed to emulate and does its best to behave in a similar way to the fully featured program that it is replacing.\n\nCheck this out. The following is interesting, and confirms what is said in the quote above.\nHere is a snippet from the beginning of the output from ls -alF /bin on an embedded Linux device. As you can see, nearly all the executables in /bin are actually symlinks to /bin/busybox (and can be called with /bin/busybox <cmd>, by the way):\n\n/bin# ls -alF /bin\ntotal 1184\ndrwxr-xr-x    2 root     root          4096 Nov 11  2021 ./\ndrwxr-xr-x   22 root     root          4096 Nov 11  2021 ../\nlrwxrwxrwx    1 root     root             7 Nov 11  2021 arch -> busybox*\nlrwxrwxrwx    1 root     root             7 Nov 11  2021 ash -> busybox*\nlrwxrwxrwx    1 root     root             7 Nov 11  2021 base64 -> busybox*\n-rwsr-xr-x    1 root     root        709792 Nov 11  2021 busybox*\nlrwxrwxrwx    1 root     root             7 Nov 11  2021 cat -> busybox*\n-rwxr-xr-x    1 root     root         10288 Nov 11  2021 chattr*\nlrwxrwxrwx    1 root     root             7 Nov 11  2021 chgrp -> busybox*\nlrwxrwxrwx    1 root     root             7 Nov 11  2021 chmod -> busybox*\nlrwxrwxrwx    1 root     root             7 Nov 11  2021 chown -> busybox*\n-rwxr-xr-x    1 root     root          1342 Nov 11  2021 compile_et*\nlrwxrwxrwx    1 root     root             7 Nov 11  2021 cp -> busybox*\nlrwxrwxrwx    1 root     root             7 Nov 11  2021 cpio -> busybox*\nlrwxrwxrwx    1 root     root             7 Nov 11  2021 date -> busybox*\nlrwxrwxrwx    1 root     root             7 Nov 11  2021 dd -> busybox*\nlrwxrwxrwx    1 root     root             7 Nov 11  2021 df -> busybox*\n\n\nSo, if you run ash, which ash shows that the ash executable is located at /bin/ash, and ls -alF /bin/ash shows that that executable is a symlink to busybox. Notice /bin/ash -> busybox*, where the * at the end is due to the ls -F flag and means \"executable\":\n\n/bin# la -alF /bin/ash\nlrwxrwxrwx    1 root     root             7 Nov 11  2021 /bin/ash -> busybox*\n\n\nSo, running ash is the same as running /bin/ash which is the same as running busybox ash which is the same as running /bin/busybox ash.\nOnce I run any of those ash or busybox ash cmds I can see that the output of echo $0 has changed from -sh to ash, meaning I am now running the ash shell inside the default -sh shell. exit will bring me back out of the ash shell and back into the -sh shell.\nTo see all the programs busybox can run, simply type busybox or busybox --help and it will spit out a big list of all of the programs compiled into its binary. Or, use busybox --list to see them all on a separate line. Run them as:\nbusybox program_name args\n\nAnyway, busybox is a popular program for small embedded Linux devices where Linux is a custom build using build tools such as Buildroot or Yocto, the two main ones.\nWhat is ash?\nSummary:\nAsh is a shell or terminal program. Kenneth Almquist made ash on 30 May 1989, barely predating bash, which was released just one week later on 8 June 1989. Herbert Xu ported ash to Debian Linux in 1997 and called it dash for \"Debian Almquist shell\".\nBusybox contains an implementation of ash, which implementation is a derivative of dash, and which is \"the most complete and most pedantically correct shell included with busybox.\"\nDetails:\nIn the context of busybox, ash is a shell built in to busybox and which can be run by calling busybox ash, as explained above.\nThe busybox source code states here that its built-in version of ash is (emphasis added):\n\nThe most complete and most pedantically correct shell included with\nbusybox. This shell is actually a derivative of the Debian 'dash'\nshell (by Herbert Xu), which was created by porting the 'ash' shell\n(written by Kenneth Almquist) from NetBSD.\n\nWhen it says that busybox's ash is \"the most complete and pedantically correct shell included with busybox\", it isn't 100% clear to me, but it appears that busybox's ash has a bunch of build options to make it bash-like, and more complete, like bash. Search these files for \"bash\" for instance to see a ton of references to what appear to be options to make ash act like bash:\n\n*\n\n*busybox/shell/ash.c\n\n*busybox/shell/Config.src\nAccording to Wikipedia's Almquist shell article, The original version of ash is the Almquist shell, initially released 30 May 1989.\nCompare this to bash, which was released just 1 week later on 8 June 1989!\nAlso according to the Wikipedia Almquist shell article above, dash was a port of ash to Debian Linux (emphasis added):\n\nIn 1997 Herbert Xu ported ash from NetBSD to Debian Linux. In September 2002, with release 0.4.1, this port was renamed to Dash (Debian Almquist shell). Xu's main priorities are POSIX conformance and slim implementation.\n\nAnd, based on the quote above from the busybox source code, busybox's ash \"is actually a derivative of the Debian dash shell (by Herbert Xu)\".\nSee also:\n\n*\n\n*https://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/82357/what-do-the-symbols-displayed-by-ls-f-mean/82358#82358\n\n*What do the symbols like =, * and | in the output of \"ls -F\" mean?\n\nA: Ash is a simple unix shell, as compared to bash, which is the more typical fully featured shell preferred on Linux systems.\nBusybox is a program that implements an ash like shell, as well as a number of other common unix programs, though in a stripped down version, all in a single program.  It is intended to provide a semi-typical unix like environment in a very space limited environment, hence, why it implements many ( stripped down ) programs as single program, and then has the separate program commands symlinked to the busybox binary, which figures out which program it is supposed to emulate and does its best to behave in a similar way to the fully featured program that it is replacing.\nBusybox was originally developed for use in very space limited environments such as a single floppy boot disk, and continues to see use today in space limited environments like embedded systems such as dd-wrt.\n", "Q: how do i fix my read only hard drive?

This is simply a waste of time especially during big system updates.\nInstead this scenario is much more reasonable:\napt-get install\nApt-get downloads libwebkit.deb and as soon as libwebkit.deb is downloaded it proceeds with installing it without waiting for chromium.deb to be fully fetched, chromium.deb at the same time is being fetched in the background.\nOnce chromium.deb has finished downloading apt-get can proceed with its installation immediately without waiting for libwebkit to install as libwebkit was already installed during the fetching of chromium.deb\n\nA: Short answer: No.\nLong answer: Why?\nAPT is very efficient at what it does, and it does well. It's counter productive download and uncompress and install all at the same time. If the process is interrupted for any motive apt hasn't ended any of its actions. Or every of it's actions take too much time to complete. Remember that one of UNIX advantages is being modular from its base. If something doesn't work you can identify and fix it.\nLets put this example:\n\n(This is how you plan to)\nWhile Chrome downloads the disk don't have space left, but wait, libwebkit is installing at the same moment too, then both fails, leaving nothing done.\n\n(This is what happens)\nOkey, I got no more space left, hey human free some space here or I can't download anything. *free some space* Okey, I got the download free space, but I don't have the installation space free, look something to remove from the filesystem. *removes stuff* Look, the installation is done.\n\nAs you can see by the simple example, the last uses a linear process to do it's work. Seems that takes more time, but is more secure that way and easy to fix any problem that could happens.\n\nA: Actually, if you do a normal 'install me some packages' routine with portage, it does all of the below:\n\n\n*\n\n*Calculates dependencies of the package and all the dependencies dependencies to the root of glibc; \n\n*Once the list of dependencies is found, it checks what packages are yet to be installed;\n\n*Determines the proper order to install them\nSo far this just about matches all package managers. Then something different happens:\n\n\n*\n\n*Provided enough free space exists (yes, the tool stores source package size) it then starts downloading each source package in installation order. \n\n\n(This happens in the background, the rest happens in-order as packages download)\n\n\n*\n\n*If your link is slow enough where a 100MB source package is taking 20 minutes, yet the prior file is done, Portage will immediately start with configuring and building the prior file, as long as no further dependencies are required for it.\n\n\nIn the case of Clementine, it requires a large number of gstreamer modules one may not already have.  It also requires QT.  Let's imagine you don't have QT. \nThe gstreamer modules don't require qt; they will download before qt. They are much smaller.  They will compile and, as part of the compilation process, fully install themselves, before qt even downloads if you have a slow enough connection.\nPlease understand that this behavior is quite useful, and nothing in Debian, Ubuntu, RPM-based or otherwise distros shares anything like it in my experience - which is about 15 years among 10 distributions and FreeBSD.\nSo the question, not decisively answered yet, is: \"Does such a parallel-fetching/installing package manager exist\" and my guess of the answer is \"not yet\". or perhaps, \"patches welcome\".\nMy $0.02, adjusted for inflation and currency exchange to your local monetary unit. \n", "Q: Problem While Upgrading Modem Manager Ubuntu 12.04 I am having a problem with Mobile broadband, it frequently disconnects about every 2-3 seconds.

Yesterday I installed ubuntu 13.10 on my laptop but I m unable boot with ubuntu. whenever I restart my system it directly goes to windows. there is no option like secure boot or legacy boot in my bios \nThanks\n\nA: How did you install Ubuntu? When you boot into Ubuntu, there are 3 options. One is showing dual boot, second one clears Windows and installs Ubuntu and third one is something like advanced options.\nIf you used 3rd one, try re-installing with 1st option. Ubuntu will setup everything for you and after POST screen before OS loads, Ubuntu will welcome you with start-up options (Load Ubuntu, Load Windows etc.).\nI had the same issue. I've chosen 3rd option and installed Ubuntu on the other partition and after installation complete my pc loaded Windows directly without asking me which OS I prefer. After that I re-installed Ubuntu with 1st option which was showing me dual OS.\n\nA: Use your LiveCD/DVD or LiveUSB to login to a live session of Ubuntu(when the prompt to install or try Ubuntu comes, use try Ubuntu). You will then need to install boot-repair. To do that, after the desktop has loaded press Ctrl+Alt+T, this will launch Terminal. Now in the terminal type these one by one:\nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:yannubuntu/boot-repair\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get install boot-repair\n\nThis will install boot-repair, after the installation is finished, type\nsudo boot-repair\n\nin the terminal, which will open boot-repair. Wait for boot-repair to finish its detections and select \"Recommended Repair\" when the prompt comes. Wait for it to finish, reboot your computer.\nHopefully that will fix your problem.\n\nA: You need to disable the quick boot feature in Windows 8, otherwise the system will boot directly into windows completely ignoring the grub configuration.

Wish you had made a photo, you could be referring to smth else than logged keystrokes.\nUbuntu doesn't log keystrokes, at least if you have a stock distribution which hadn't been tampered with. It may be possible that you had a keylogger accidentally installed on your machine.

It's usually like 192.168.1.1 or something like that. It takes you to the routers menu and you can allow your mac address.\nTo elaborate, open up a browser and type in your routers default IP. It will ask you to login, usually the username is blank and the password is admin but each router is different. You can look up the default username and password easily on google.\nThen make sure there are no security settings preventing your computer from connecting.\nIf all else fails, reset the router. You will have to reconfigure all of the passwords but generally that's a good idea to do anyway. Especially if you do not have a router password (not the password you type in when you connect to the internet, the password and username you create to access your router).\n", "Q: How to deploy Havana with juju I've been all over the web searching for an installation guide for openstack Havana via juju charms over Ubuntu saucy 13.10 which is said to be build specially for Havana; with no luck at all.\nAll I could find is either how to install the ancient openstack Essax over Precise 12.04 or installing Havana over 12.04 directly \"without juju\".\nI tried blindly by deploying these charms over 10 MaaS nodes, and add all the possible relations between then from the gui:\n\n*\n\n*juju-gui\n\n*openstack-dashboard\n\n*cinder\n\n*glance\n\n*keystone\n\n*nova-cloud-controller\n\n*quantum-gateway\n\n*mysql\n\n*rabbitmq-server\n\n*nova-compute\n\nAnd all were deployed and started successfully.

There is no 64-bit version of Skype. Skype is a 32-bit program but works well on 64-bit systems.\nTo install Skype on 64bit Ubuntu, just press Ctrl+Alt+T on your keyboard to open Terminal. When it opens, run the command(s) below:\nsudo dpkg --add-architecture i386\nsudo apt-get install ia32-libs\nsudo apt-get update\nwget -O skype-install.deb http://www.skype.com/go/getskype-linux-deb\nsudo dpkg -i skype-install.deb\nsudo apt-get -f install\n\n", "Q: Dual boot Win 8.1 - Xubuntu 12.04 problem I have a asus s56 with preloaded Windows 8 and I've recently upgraded to Windows 8.1. \nDuring the installation of Xubuntu I've selected custom partitioning (something else): \nI've formatted in ext4 a partition and I've there the root, I've selected another empty partition for swap and then I've put the xubuntu bootloader in the first, cause I've read that for some reasons it's better to leave boot operations to windows leaving the system MBR intact, and then to insert an entry in the win boot manager. \nAfter installing Xubuntu, I've managed to insert the entry from Windows with EasyBCD: I've choosen Grub2. Restarting the pc the blue screen to select the os appears: If I choose Windows it starts perfectly, if I choose Xubuntu Windows boot manager reports error and doesn't boot Xubuntu.\nWhat can I do?\n\nA: Setting up a working GRUB2 configuration is a more practical solution than chainloading GRUB2, more so on an UEFI drive.\nFirst of all, please disable Secure Boot in BIOS Setup. There are more 'refined' solutions (GRUB UEFI windows boot fail) to marry Secure Boot and Linux, but leave it for now.\nSecond, run boot-repair (laptop not booting to ubuntu 13.04 after installing windows 8) which should both update and install GRUB2 automatically.\nThat's all.\n", "Q: Strange error while reinstalling 12.04 So I'm trying to install Ubuntu 12.04 (64-bit) to an external HDD.\nI select where I want the swap area, the boot loader, etc (the \"something else\" option). That all works fine, then I click \"Install Now\", it then starts formatting my HDD and copying files. Great. \nI then fill out the \"Where are you\" window and click continue, I then fill out the \"Who are you\" window (all fields are green, username is all lower case). And then I click the \"Continue\" button, then the mouse turns into the \"clock\" and the installer continues to copy files. But when it finishes copying (progress bar is full) the progress bar then vanishes and nothing happens, the \"Who are you\" window is still displayed, the mouse is still the \"clock\". Absolutely nothing changes (except for the progress bar).\nUpdate\nI cancelled the installation then restarted the installer, but this time I selected the \"Reinstall Ubuntu 12.04.3 LST\" (or something like that), it then installs, but now I get a sort-of blue screen error (but with a black screen instead) when it starts to install grub 2.\nFirst line of the error...\n[1276.066187] BUG: unable to handle kernel paging request at 00000000bd80819c\n\nA few lines later...\n[1276.068391]    call trace\n[1276.068391] [<ffffffff81054bd6>] ? efi_call4+0x46/0x80\n\nThere's then a few more lines of the call trace, but I only copied the last call.\nThis looks like a bug to me, but if it's not, what can I do to fix this problem?\n\nA: I've found a solution. What I actually ended up doing was creating a Live-USB on my external HDD then installed from that to my smaller memory stick. Now everything works perfectly fine.\n", "Q: The old wireless problem I am suffering from the same old wireless problem. I tried everything I could find on the net as well as Ubuntu forums, but nothing works.\nHow can I fix this??\nmy device information from lshw -C network:\n***product: BCM4311 802.11a/b/g\nvendor: Broadcom Corporation\nconfiguration: driver=wl latency=0***\n\nTo me, what I was able to learn from the net, the driver is just the right one. but still it isn't working.\niwconfig shows:\n**lo   no wireless extensions.\neth0 no wireless extensions.**\n\nWhat other information do you need?\n\nA: The same old problem deserves the same old answer. The Broadcom STA proprietary driver offered by the Additional Drivers tool is wrong for your Broadcom 4311 device.

I am developing Android applications and the Android emulator I use cannot run in xrdp. I can only start it with vnc. So I suffer from switching from xrdp to vnc all day.\n\nA: For me, the best solution for remote controlling another desktop PC is Team viewer. It performs very fast, and it's cross-platform.

Is it possible to deploy the OpenStack bundle to one machine with the CLI?\nIs it possible to edit the example.yaml bundle with --to machine?\nIf yes, how? \n\nA: You would need to modify the bundles .yaml file to include the 'to' directives, I don't have any experience with deploying the Openstack bundle specifically to a single machine however.\nAn example using 'to':\nenvExport:\n  services:\n    mysql:\n      # The only machine id supported is machine 0\n      to: 0\n    wordpress:\n      units: 3\n    redis-server:\n      units: 3\n      to: [lxc:wordpress, wordpress]\n    ceph:\n      units: 4\n      to: [wordpress, wordpress, wordpress, wordpress]\n    serenade:\n      to: lxc:wordpress=2\n\nYou can find more information on the deployer here: http://pythonhosted.org/juju-deployer/config.html#placement\nAdditional information on deploying bundles from the CLI and the GUI can be found here: https://jujucharms.com/docs/stable/charms-bundles\n\nA: You can install openstack-in-a-box using DevStack.\nIt is not a production setup, but it is pretty easy to install and get up and running from the CLI.\n", "Q: Brother DCP-7055W My Brother DCP 7055W does not scan.

I can print (after installing the driver from Brother's site it didn't work - would show up in the list of printers, grumble in the error log about \"Highest\" not being a valid resolution and so on, but otherwise silently fail to print, then I saw something about their 64-bit drivers not really being 64-bit, and eventually - possibly thanks to apt-get install lib32gcc-4.8-dev of all things - it would print).\nBut with all the info on the net I still cannot scan. I have the Brother brscan2 and brscan-skey-0.2.4-1 (the latter might not be a good idea?), but sane-find-scanner does not find it (in fact gives an error: could not fetch string descriptor: Pipe error) but scanning does work with my HP Deskjet 1510 that is also attached by USB, and scanimage -L finds it.  \nI am using (64-bit Intel) Kubuntu 13.10 (also failed with recent Ubuntu that I had installed before) but I am pretty sure it did work with an earlier Fedora install (on a 32-bit system). I have both USB and network connections to the MFC-5860CN, and only USB to the HP1510.\nThings people seem to say might be the problem:\n\n\n*\n\n*CUPS (since v 1.4?) CAN INTERFERE WITH MULTIFUNCTION PRINTERS working as scanners?\n\n*Brother proprietary drivers: 32-bit good, 64-bit troublesome?\n\n*brscan-skey may be a problem??\n\n*Instructions on Brother site miss important steps involving /usr/local/Brother/sane/setupSaneScan2 -i ??\n\n*need to reboot and/or re-plug the USB cable?\n\n\nI cannot say any of these ideas actually got my scanner going.

The laptop is Ubuntu-certified for Ubuntu 12.04 64bit, so I wasn't expecting any problems. First I tried to get the Broadcom 43142 wifi/bluetooth module working on Ubuntu 12.10 64bit but failed. Therefore I made a fresh Ubuntu 13.10 64bit installation yesterday. Here the wifi module was recognized out of the box. The only thing I had to do was to enable the restricted driver.

Make and installed wl.ko and remember to load the btusb module for bluetooth to work \n\nA: Broadcom 43142 bluetooth is supported by the Linux kernel, but it requires a binary firmware file that distros cannot include because of licensing issues.\nIf you look at the system log you will probably see that the kernel attempts to load the firmware from a file named BCM43142A0-04ca-2007.hcd and fails.\nGetting the file involves downloading the Windows drivers for the chip, locating the file named BCM43142A0_001.001.011.0122.0153.hex and then converting it to hcd format using hex2hcd. The converted file should be placed in /lib/firmware/brcm/BCM43142A0-04ca-2007.hcd. \nThe windows drivers EXE installer can be unpacked using wine - the installer will create a folder under drive_c where you should find the required .hex file. The current drivers for B590 apparently have changed the names of the .hex files, so I had to do extra googling to get the file from the installer for another model.\nIf you don't feel like doing the conversion yourself you can use the BCM43142A0-04ca-2007.hcd file that I made which should be copied to where the kernel will search for it:\n    sudo cp BCM43142A0-04ca-2007.hcd /lib/firmware/brcm/\n\nAnd this is the original BCM43142A0_001.001.011.0122.0153.hex taken from a windows installer, just in case you need it. \n", "Q: How can I change gnome terminal font in command line?

In UEFI mode, the hard drive is not detected and in legacy mode, the kernel hangs. I figured regardless of whether UEFI or legacy mode is used, there's going to be an extra step involved, so I decided to stick with UEFI mode.\nThe following link should help:\nhttps://help.ubuntu.com/community/UEFI\nBasically, I followed the web page and left Fast Boot and Intel Smart Response Technology disabled. The system booted the LiveUSB drive with secure boot enabled. Also, ensure that UEFI is checked/enabled in BIOS. Then install Ubuntu in UEFI mode (website has information on how to identify whether LiveUSB is booted with legacy or UEFI mode). After install, reboot using the LiveUSB drive and select \"Try Ubuntu\". Follow the instructions in the section, \"Converting Ubuntu into EFI mode\" to download/install the Boot-Repair utility and use it to separate the /boot/efi partition. Afterwards, the UEFI firmware was able to detect and boot Ubuntu 13.10 from the mSATA drive.\n", "Q: Node.js NVM causes Xubuntu login loop with ~/.profile line There are various posts on the Xubuntu login loop, but none of them address NVM (Node Version Manager).\nI have installed NodeJS via NVM on my Xubuntu VM and it works fine, however after rebooting, I can't log into Xfce anymore.

So first of all and that worries me most is that after some time I can't write in chats.\nFor example, if I'm pressing \"backspace\" in Skype chat it behaves strange. With every click it starts to write different symbols - like, if I press backspace, it will write \"p\", second press will write \"m\" and etc and everytime its in some sort of pattern, like, pressing 12 times backspace it will do something like this \"pmgh m pmgh m\".\nAnd it's exactly the same with every symbol on keyboard. After that, I can only do a Skype restart and everything then is normal for some time, then it will start all over (but every symbol will have a different patterns). If this would be Windows I would definitely think I have some sort of virus or some sort of script that changes symbols (because it's in patterns),\nI have no idea whats happening here.

Maybe try downloading the .iso again (make sure you get 32 or 64 bit depending on your hardware).\nThere are applications that make the drive bootable for you, Universal Pen Drive is a good one. Just copying a .zip or .iso onto a USB drive does not make it bootable.\nAfter re downloading Ubuntu and making a bootable usb, hold down f12 (or option depending on your hardware) and it should pull up a list of bootable drives.\nAnother thing to check is the format of the USB drive before you try to put ubuntu on it, I'd use Fat 32.\n", "Q: Installing fglrx driver Ubuntu I am installing the fglrx driver, as described in https://help.ubuntu.com/community/BinaryDriverHowto/ATI.\nThe problem is now that when I type the command \naticonfig --initial\n\n, I get the following: \n\"aticonfig: No supported adapters detected\", \n\nand  then X is not loaded in Ubuntu.\nMy GPU is AMD Radeon HD 7600M Series.\n\nA: I've got the same card and the closed-source drivers in ubuntu 13.10 doesn't work at all.

I thought for a while it was synergy that was causing the problems.

Likely that file is not in the PATH when lightdm tries to execute the script, so it can't find it. And because a session startup script fails, lightdm tries to switch back to greeter-session, which again tries to load that script and this goes on-and-on.

That's why driver parameters exist; if the built-in driver doesn't exactly fit your particular laptop model, you may have success trying a parameter, in your case, wapf=1.

What are advantages and disadvantages of each OS ?\nShould i choose Lubuntu or Ubuntu to be Dual-booted with Windows 7 on my Aspire ?\nSorry for this such question,i'm just new to Ubuntu\n\nA: Lubuntu uses LXDE for the Desktop Manager (the GUI), which supposedly runs with only 512 MB of RAM as opposed to Unity, which is a known memory hog. Thus, it would be \"lighter\". From the LXDE site:\n\nLightweight\nIt needs less CPU and performs extremely well with reasonable memory.\nFast\nIt runs well even on older computers produced in 1999, and it does not require 3D acceleration.\n\n...\n\nThe hardware requirements of LXDE are similiar to Windows 98 (Maybe a little bit higher). An old Pentium II CPU is enough.\nAfter X11 and LXDE are started, the total memory usage is about 45 MB on i386 machines. (This value may be higher or lower according to\ndifferent system configurations.)\nThough LXDE itself doesn't require better hardware, other applications under X do need it. For example, Firefox and\nOpenOffice.org 2 are quite memory-hungry. So it's recommended that you\nhave a RAM of more than 128 MB.\n\nAs for the applications that come default installed with Lubuntu, they are lighter and run on less RAM. They may have less features, but they are built to run on older equipment, such as my iBook G4 (downloading the iso for Lubuntu 12.04 now :D).\nYou can read here: https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Lubuntu#Lubuntu_vs_Ubuntu about the comparison. Basically, what makes Lubuntu lighter (faster) is the DE, LXDE.\nThus, LXDE itself runs lighter/better on older/limited hardware. You can read more about this on the LXDE about site: http://lxde.org/lxde.\nAs for which one to go with, I would try going with Lubuntu first and then if you want it, install Unity. I've heard (not confirmed though) that Lubuntu is faster overall and thus you can just add the apps you want after the install.\nI have an old 7-8 yr old Toshiba Satellite A105 with 1GB of RAM and Unity runs, for the most part, great on that. If I have a large number of tabs open in Firefox or several apps running at once it slows down, but usually its fine!\nSo, it really comes down to the speed-features trade-off. Unity/Ubuntu seems to have more features, but LXDE/Lubuntu has more speed. It's really your choice.\n", "Q: How to view the list of c library functions? I'm a newbie in Linux programming.

SOLUTION: The problem appears to be that the Bluetooth module does not work well with xHCI in Linux.  There is a BIOS setting labeled \"XHCI PRE-BOOT MODE\", which must be set to \"Disabled\".  If it is not, then Linux will treat the Bluetooth module as if it is connected to an xHCI bus instead of an EHCI bus, causing communication errors.  HOWEVER, THIS FIX WILL DISABLE USB 3.0 ON YOUR SYSTEM.  I do not have a better solution at this moment, but at least this works.\nI have a new ASUS UX301LA laptop, and I am running Ubuntu Gnome 13.10 (Saucy).

While bluetooth was blocked via rfkill, this appeared to have no effect, and hciconfig hci0 up responded that the device was still blocked.  When bluetooth was unblocked using rfkill, /sys/class/bluetooth/hci0 does not exist, so the attempt to manually turn it on fails.  I attempted to add this to /etc/rc.local as well, and there was no apparent difference compared to simply running the commands as root on the console.\nEDIT: I emailed the Intel wifi developers, and they issued this incredibly helpful response:\nHello,\n\nI am afraid you are asking the wrong people. We are WiFi people and not Bluetooth.\n\nThanks,\n(name removed)\n\nI will attempt to hack the Bluetooth drivers myself to see if I can coax any more debugging information out of them.\nDoes anybody have any suggestions to help me out?  Has anybody experienced this before?  Are there any Ubuntu users who have an ASUS UX301LA who might have any tips?\nLet me know what other information might be useful, and I'll post it.  I just didn't want to overload this first post with useless data.\n\nA: I also have UX301LA and I'm now running 14.10. I suffered from the same problem, but discovered a workaround that is not ideal, but works for now. \nBasically, it seems that the asus-nb-wmi module is not fully compatible with that hardware. Although, the actual problem seems to exist much deeper, blocking that module prevents creation of new rfkill entries corresponding to WiFi and Bluetooth and then the default state after boot is with both WiFi and Bluetooth working (even using USB 3.0). The F2 switch still when ON makes the Bluetooth disappear, but when OFF (default after boot), it does not disable WiFi, while Bluetooth device appears. The downside is that the Fx keys stop working when the module is blocked as they are also supported by this module. To achieve that effect, just add blacklist asus-nb-wmi to /etc/modprobe.d/blacklist.conf\nA better solution would be to report the bug upstream or for now change the source of the module to disable handling wifi/bluetooth while still handle other Fx keys.\n\nA: The same problem occurs with my Lenovo T440s. I do not have a solution at this point in time, but it looks like we are affected by a kernel bug (a discussion of it can be found here).\nAdding\necho \"on\" > /sys/class/bluetooth/hci0/device/../power/control\n\nto /etc/rc.local seems to help a bit, but the connection to my bluetooth mouse is still unstable.\n\nA: Take a look at: /usr/share/gnome-bluetooth/pin-code-database.xml\nDoes your mouse exist there (search using the OUI, which is the \"OEM Unique Identifier\", which is the first 3 octets of the mouse MAC address. For example, if your mouse MAC address is AA:BB:CC:DD:EE:FF, then the OUI is \"AA:BB:CC\")?\nIf it does already exist, make sure it looks something like:\n\n(note the trailing colon: \"AA:BB:CC*:*\" - don't leave it out).\nIf it doesn't already exist, add it.\nAlso, not sure if this is related, but there is a well know issue with the Intel 7260 WiFi (frequent sporadic disconnects). To workaround the WiFi issue, I've found the only thing that works is disabling 802.11n:\n\n\n*\n\n*Open terminal.\n\n*sudo vi /etc/modprobe.d/wifi-disable11n.conf\n\n*Add this line: options iwlwifi 11n_disable=1\n\n*Save and restart.\n\n\nI'm just taking a tab in the dark, but it would be worth a shot (IMHO).\n\nA: I solved my problems by installing new firmware from\nhttp://ftp.de.debian.org/debian/pool/non-free/f/firmware-nonfree/firmware-iwlwifi_0.40_all.deb\nUsing an acer s7 392, intel wireless 7260 rev6b, kubuntu 13.10, kernel 3.11.0-15-generic\n", "Q: apt-get problem every time I try to install something by writing sudo apt-get install in the terminal, I have always the same answer :\nE: The package linux-image-3.0.0-32-generic needs to be reinstalled, but I can't find an archive for it.\n\nI can't remove and reinstall this package (same error) and I don't know how I can correct this error.

There are various ways you can convert your packages to multiarch if you use the recipes instead:\n\ndh(1) and autotools\nThe simplest package to convert is one that uses autoconf upstream and\n  dh(1) in the Debian packaging.\n  \n  \n*\n  \n*Build-depend on debhelper (>= 9).\n  \n*Add Pre-Depends: ${misc:Pre-Depends}  to any package listed in debian/control that provides a shared library.\n  \n*Update debian/compat to '9'.\n  \n*Replace occurrences of /usr/lib/ in debian/*.install with /usr/lib/*/.\n  \n*If /usr/lib (or a subdirectory) is listed as an installation target in debian/*.install, or the target of a link in debian/*.links,\n  you will need to substitute the value of $(DEB_HOST_MULTIARCH) into\n  this file. See `Dynamic debian/* files below.\n  \n*Any occurrences of /usr/lib in debian/rules should be replaced with /usr/lib/$(DEB_HOST_MULTIARCH).\n  \n*If you needed to use $(DEB_HOST_MULTIARCH) in debian/rules in either of the two preceding steps, set DEB_HOST_MULTIARCH in\n  debian/rules by calling: DEB_HOST_MULTIARCH ?= $(shell\n  dpkg-architecture -qDEB_HOST_MULTIARCH).\n  \n*Once you have built the package and verified that the shared library package contains only the expected files, and that your -dev\n  package still works, mark this shared library package Multi-Arch: same\n  in debian/control.\n  \n*Mark the common package(which is \"all\") Multi-Arch: foreign in debian/control, if it may be needed by the shared library package. \n  \n  \n  If you have overridden debhelper commands in debian/rules, despite\n  using dh(1) for the rest of the build, you may need to follow the\n  instructions below for classic debhelper to modify mv, cp or rm\n  commands used by your override rules.\n\nThere are more examples in the Debian packaging implementation guide https://wiki.debian.org/Multiarch/Implementation.

I am planning to upgrade from 13.04 to 13.10?\nDoes upgrading delete my files, documents and third party apps.

Better safe than sorry.\nUpgrading normally does not delete files.

Get it from \ngparted.org/download.php\n\nUse Tuxboot to make a bootable USB Pendrive and boot from the USB. If pendrive with Tuxboot installed GParted fails to boot (happened to me), use UNetBootin. When you boot into GParted, click on the drive with Windows partition and click Resize/Move. Resize the partition as you want and click Apply. It will start going, it's a fast process. When you're done, reboot, and this time boot into your hard drive. Done!

What's broken?\nI've tried several usb 2.0 flash drives, they all read and write fine, pretty sure it's not a hardware thing.\n\nA: There's nothing broken.\nTo format a partition, you need to have write access to the partition file in /dev. This can only be done as superuser (root). You should've noticed that GParted asked you for your password. At this moment you granted the program root permissions.\nNautilus, or any other file browser/manager, is run with user permissions by default, so it can read and write to the mounted stick directory, but not to the device file itself, which it would have to do in order to format the partition.

I'm running Ubuntu 12.04 LTS on a new Asus notebook computer (Ubuntu was pre-installed).

I thought Ubuntu will automatically add new hard drives so I only attached them and booted the system. Ubuntu indeed added them but they look like USB flash drives and I can unmount them. \n\nHow can I add them in a way they they look like a system partitions and not like some USB flash drives?\n\nA: In this point Ubuntu doesn't make a real difference between hard drives and USB sticks...\nStorage device is storage device. Every partition (except the root partition) is treated the same way, be it on a internal HDD or an CD or whatever. They all mounted on their own mountpoint and can all be unmounted.\nI guess you're looking forward to something like the \"My Computer\" on Windows.

I'm sorry if it's a duplicate, but I could not find an answer for it. If anyone tried it, please let me know what happens exactly. Thanks :)\n\nA: Sounds like you just need to install grub to the USB to boot from it.  You can try it out before doing that by running \nsudo update-grub\n\nand the new USB system should be found and added to the grub menu.  Try it out.  If you want to boot from the USB, run\nsudo grub-install /dev/sdx\n\nwhere x is your actual device, and change the BIOS boot order to boot from USB before the hard disk..\n", "Q: How to purge another OS and install Ubuntu safely? I've been testing out different linux os's and was beforedhand on fedora. A few weeks back, when booting up fedora, my computer crashed. When i tried to boot it back up, it would freeze at the BIOS POST. \nToday I decided to give it another try, and downloaded 12.04 on a CD Rom to see if I could load it. I can get it to load up the CD and i'm able to try out Ubuntu but when I go to install it it tells me I have to have at least 4.5 GB available drive space and it won't let me continue. \nThe problem is I can't figure out how to delete files on the hard drive to free it up to be able to install ubuntu. Do you think the hard drive fried back with that crash under fedora?\n\nA: You could see if Ubuntu running from the CD will let you install GParted.  Then GParted may be able to either partition out enough space for installing Ubuntu or could format the drive and allow Ubuntu to install.  This second option, formatting, will erase everything on the drive.  Make sure there is nothing on the drive that you want to keep before you format it.\n", "Q: Build data.tar.gz instead of data.tar.xz inside deb I just updated to dpkg 1.17 and it now defaults to compressing data.tar with xz instead of gzip. That creates a problem when I'm remastering CD's for older versions of ubuntu.\nIs there a way to tell dpkg-buildpackage to create data.tar.gz instead of xz? I tried -Zgzip without success.\n\nRelated manpages:\ndpkg-buildpackage\n\n-z, -Z\nPassed unchanged to dpkg-source.

The dpkg-source isn't responsible for creating a .deb package. It is only used to create the source package.\nIn fact dpkg-deb creates the packages witch is normally called by dh_builddeb in debian/rules. You can add change this command to dh_builddeb -- -Zgzip or call dpkg-deb -Zgzip directly.\nIf the command dh_builddeb isn't listed explicitly in the debian/rules file\nyou can add the following lines to make it work:\noverride_dh_builddeb:\n        dh_builddeb -- -Zgzip\n\nNote that before the dh_builddeb option there is only one tab, not multiple spaces as this is a Makefile.\n\nA: I don't know why it doesn't work for you, but in Debian it works as intended:\n$ dpkg-buildpackage -Zgzip \ndpkg-buildpackage: source package lastfm\ndpkg-buildpackage: source version 1:1.5.4.27091+dfsg1-1\ndpkg-buildpackage: source distribution unstable\ndpkg-buildpackage: source changed by John Stamp <jstamp@users.sourceforge.net>\ndpkg-buildpackage: host architecture i386\n dpkg-source -Zgzip --before-build lastfm-1.5.4.27091+dfsg1\ndpkg-source: warning: unknown information field 'Dm-Upload-Allowed' in input data in general section of control info file\n\nIf I try to use anything else:\ndpkg-buildpackage -Zgz  \ndpkg-buildpackage: source package lastfm\ndpkg-buildpackage: source version 1:1.5.4.27091+dfsg1-1\ndpkg-buildpackage: source distribution unstable\ndpkg-buildpackage: source changed by John Stamp <jstamp@users.sourceforge.net>\ndpkg-buildpackage: host architecture i386\n dpkg-source -Zgz --before-build lastfm-1.5.4.27091+dfsg1\ndpkg-source: gz is not a supported compression\n\nUse --help for program usage information.\ndpkg-buildpackage: error: dpkg-source -Zgz --before-build lastfm-1.5.4.27091+dfsg1 gave error exit status 2\n\nIt err.

I imagine I would start the Installer from windows and it would create an initial bootable file system on my hard drive, then I would restart and boot it, and it finishes the install. I want to keep my windows too. Is this possible? \n\nA: Go get Unetbootin, pendrive with at least 2 GB space and an Ubuntu iso of course. You have to start Unetbootin, browse to the iso, choose the right pendrive and start. After it's done, boot from USB and start installation. Remember to choose right partition. Done :)\n\nA: That is not what you do. Instead you burn a bootable disk or usb stick using the \"disk images\" found on Ubuntu's website. You then boot your medium and follow the installer. Manual partitioning is also unnecessary, as the installer can create a partition for you.\n", "Q: Command not found when sshing into Ubuntu for amazon instance When trying to ssh into my ubuntu instance, I receive -bash: ssh: command not found.

Where is Nautilus in Ubuntu 13.10? \nI see only Files app which is similar but lacks some Nautilus features, especially on right-click menu. Can it be installed along official Files app?\nI was also unable to install nautilus-scripts in Files. \n\nA: Files is nautilus, just under a different name. For some reason nautilus devs have removed a lot of features in the latest release hence the lack of proper right click menu and script support. If you want the old nautilus back I would suggest installing \"nemo\", a fork of the old version by the guys at linux mint. To do this run:\nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:gwendal-lebihan-dev/cinnamon-stable\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get install nemo\n\nIn a terminal. The nemo app will them be accessible from the dash.\n\nA: The accepted answer doesn't mention that you can still install nautilus scripts without installing any forks of nautilus and I would recommend to stay with the Ubuntu versions. \nJust put your scripts into ~/.local/share/nautilus/scripts and make them executable with chmod +x SCRIPT_PATHS. Finally restart nautilus with nautilus -q.\nIf you prefer to do it without the terminal:\n\n\n*\n\n*move the scripts to the above location (might require to show hidden files, that's Ctrl+H)\n\n*select the scripts, right click\n\n*choose Properties -> Permissions\n\n*check \"allow executing file as program\".\n\n*logout\n\n", "Q: Hosting Ubuntu and Windows on one PC I've new years resolution to get to grips with a Linux type of operating system and I think Ubuntu looks the most likely I'd enjoy, as it seems to have good support and a thriving community.

I was using an Nvidia driver that worked well until that update. I had installed it from Nvidia's shell script instead of apt-get.\nI have uninstalled this driver. I also tried Ubuntu's nvidia-current package, without success. I have purged it. I also reinstalled the desktop packages using \"apt-get install ubuntu-desktop\".\nRebooting still boots to text mode. Doing \"sudo service lightdm restart\" does not go to graphics mode. It just switches to virtual console #7.\nAs a test, I run sudo startx from a text mode shell, and it fails with this message:\nFATAL: Error inserting nvidia_304 (/lib/modules/3.8.0-34-generic/updates/dkms/nvidia_304.ko): No such device\n\nThat .ko file exists and contains 15254672 bytes.\nIt seems like the system still wants to use the Nvidia driver, even though I uninstalled it.\nHow can I tell startx to avoid the Nvidia driver completely? Once startx would work, I assume lightdm might work too. Then I could try to reinstall the Nvidia driver.\nI have looked at numerous pages on this forum, but everybody seems to have a different variant of this problem.\nuname -a reports 3.8.0-34-generic. The PC is an x86_64. The system has the linux-headers-3.8.0-34-generic package, according to dpkg -l.\n\nA: Since you are using 12.04, it may be possible to use the command-line version of the 'Additional Drivers' tool, called jockey-text. To get started, log in at one of the virtual terminals (Ctrl+Alt+Fn where n is 1,2,..6) and then type\njockey-text --list 2>/dev/null\n\n(the 2>/dev/null is optional - it just hides a bunch of error messages about other hardware / drivers). It will take some time since it searches online but you should eventually see a list like\nxorg:nvidia_173 - NVIDIA accelerated graphics driver (Proprietary, Disabled, Not in use)\nxorg:nvidia_173_updates - NVIDIA accelerated graphics driver (post-release updates) (Proprietary, Disabled, Not in use)\nxorg:nvidia_304 - NVIDIA accelerated graphics driver (Proprietary, Disabled, Not in use)\nxorg:nvidia_304_updates - NVIDIA accelerated graphics driver (post-release updates) (Proprietary, Enabled, In use)\nxorg:nvidia_319 - NVIDIA accelerated graphics driver (Proprietary, Disabled, Not in use)\nxorg:nvidia_319_updates - NVIDIA accelerated graphics driver (post-release updates) (Proprietary, Disabled, Not in use)\n\nFrom here you can proceed in one of two ways (both equivalent, as far as I know):\n\n\n*\n\n*disable the current (troublesome) driver, so that the system falls back to the previous - hopefully good - driver e.g. if xorg:nvidia_304_updates is currently Enabled, In use then do\nsudo jockey-text --disable xorg:nvidia_304_updates\n\n\n*explicitly enable a previous known good driver e.g.\nsudo jockey-text --enable xorg:nvidia_304\n\nIf you get a message about being unable to connect to the system bus, then try adding the --no-dbus switch e.g. sudo jockey-text --no-dbus --disable xorg:nvidia_304_updates\n", "Q: How can I record video from 2 webcams?

For that reason I created a private key which I moved to \n/etc/ssl/private/\n\nI'm just wondering why there already is private key ssl-cert-snakeoil.key in there. Where is this private key used and can I delete it?\n\nA: The ssl-snakeoil.key is a key created by ssl-cert package post-install scripts. It's created for the snakeoil user and should not be deleted:\ngrep '#' /var/lib/dpkg/info/ssl-cert.postinst \n#!/bin/sh -e\n# Create the ssl-cert system group for snakeoil ownership:\n# Check if the generated snakeoil key/cert has been generated \n# from a vulnerable openssl version and replace it if necessary.\n    # check if the cert and key file exist,\n    # the issuer and subject are the same (self signed cert)\n    # and the private key is vulnerable\n# no need to perform any check. If the certificates are there\n# it will exit 0.\n# allow group ssl-cert to access /etc/ssl/private\n# If we're upgrading from an older version, fix the unreadable key:\n\nNow, what's the ssl-cert package:\n\nThis package enables unattended installs of packages that\n   need to create SSL certificates.\nIt is a simple wrapper for OpenSSL's certificate request utility that\n   feeds it with the correct user variables.\n\nSo it is a certificate used to install packages that need to create SSL certificates, so the system generates one on the fly with the installation of this package.\nAs a side note, this package is not exclusive to Ubuntu, since it also appears in Debian.\n\nA: It's a server-specific public and private key pair created when the server's Debian based OS is installed (like Ubuntu).\nIt is used in cases where no other SSL certificate is installed or configured, but encrypted communication is enabled and desired.\nWhile it does securely encrypt traffic, it is insecure and thus named 'snakeoil' because it's lack of root authority signature means it is vulnerable to the most simple man-in-the-middle attacks.\nWebsite administrators really need to reconfigure services that reference the snakeoil key with a properly signed key from their CA, like the one they hopefully use for HTTPS.\n", "Q: Disabling the anti-aliasing for a specific font with user's fonts.conf Purpose:\nI am trying to disable anti-aliasing via ~/.config/fontconfig/fonts.conf for a specific font, but so far without success.

Now lmb is select and rmb is context menu.\nNote this is one of those clickpad trackpads with two buttons underneath it.

All the research I've done so far shows how to re-order the buttons on a device but not how to reassign them in such a way that rmb and lmb are the same.\nrecap: I want lmb and rmb to initiate select.

A click pad device has\n          button(s) integrated into the touchpad surface.  The  user  must\n          press  downward  on  the touchpad in order to generated a button\n          press. This property may be set automatically  if  a  click  pad\n          device  is detected at initialization time. Property: \"Synaptics\n          ClickPad\"\n\nor more likely the\n\nOption \"TapButton2\" \"integer\"\n\n          Which mouse button is reported on a non-corner  two-finger  tap.\n          Set to 0 to disable. Property: \"Synaptics Tap Action\"\n\noption will solve your problem. Check your current settings with xinput --list-props \"ETPS/2 Elantech Touchpad\" or with synclient -l. Then modify your settings with either xinput or synclient, which you like more.\n\nUpdate 2:\nSo you figured it out and you only had to disable the soft button area for the right button by setting every RightButtonArea* parameter to 0, with synclient RightButtonAreaLeft=0, synclient RightButtonAreaTop=0. (As the other were already on 0.) The same command with xinput would be xinput --set-prop \"ETPS/2 Elantech Touchpad\" \"Synaptics Soft Button Areas\" 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0.\n", "Q: Best practices to keep your ubuntu desktop and laptop in sync? How would you approach if you want your desktop and laptop to be in sync. So you don't have to install/configure the same app twice and also can just stop working on the one device and continue on the other?\n\nA: OK. What you need is two separate features. I only know a lot about one, but I will do my best to give you the background to the other. \nI have 8 computers in my house, and keeping all my files on all of them is a necessity. Unfortunately, I also have about 25 GB of files to sync, so I couldn't use any on-line storage site - they don't give you enough space (except for copy.com - you can sign up for 2 free accounts, and share the data between them. It will be half on one, half on the other, so if you share everything you have 30 GB of space. Whether or not this is allowed, I don't know. It also means that your data is twice as likely to be hacked into.)\nAnyway, another solution which doesn't require your files being stored on-line is Bit torrent Sync. This requires a program to be installed on both computers (it's available for free on Windows, Mac OS X and Linux). You then enter a secure address (which it generates) and it syncs your files across - either via your LAN or the internet, and their servers.\nYou could also sync the folders with the program files in them, but that could cause instability. In the ubuntu software centre, you can sync installed programs to another computer.\nClick on \nFile -> Sync Between Computers\nYou then sign up for an Ubuntu Software Centre account (which may be the same as an Ubuntu 1 account). On the second computer, you sign in to this account in the same way, \nFile -> Sync Between Computers\nbut then click 'I already have an account'\nlook at this How-To Geek article for more information.\n", "Q: Why is medibuntu.org still offered as a package source if it has been shutdown since 2010?

Haven't you yourself added the medibuntu repository manually? Removing such repositories is entirely your responsibility.\n\nA: Obsolete sources that were added manually, need to be removed manually as well.

I thought it was my old keyboard, but with the new one: the same problem.\nI work this around by pressing the numlock key so that the numeric pad doesn't type numbers (the light should be off, because it is reversed, as you said), then I just unplug and plug my keyboard: it is back in sync.\nI am still not sure on when does this happens, but I believe it occurs when system is idle for a long time period.\n\nA: To do this, you plug in a second keyboard. Then change the numlock settings on that one. The light should stay the same on your original keyboard, but the computer will see it as having changed, back to the way it should be.\n\nA: On Ubuntu 16.04\nAs a workaround,  tapping the Num Lock twice works to get it back in sync. I'd still like to know why this happens and how to insure that it doesn`t \n\nA: One reason might be that GNOME is set to remember the numlock status between boots, which can cause a mismatch.\nCheck from a terminal prompt with:-\ngsettings list-recursively | grep -e numlock\n\nIt can be changed via an elevated terminal with:-\nsudo gsettings set org.gnome.desktop.peripherals.keyboard remember-numlock-state false\n\nTest by rebooting.\nSee also\nGNOME bug tracker #62: numlock-state not saved/restored\n", "Q: Laptop hotspot during sleep mode I turned my laptop into a hotspot what i wish to know if it is possible that my hotspot can be access if my laptop is in sleep mode .

(like this)\nOr freebsd jails? (wiki here)\nOr chroot?\nMaybe run a virtual machine with virtual box?\nProbably a separate box with no real user info and connect it to a network that doesn't have a bunch of goodies on it?\n\nA: You can use a chroot to have a separate operating system installation for steam but access the program from your regular installation. I've never setup a chroot myself, nor am I an expert, and therefore the below is merely provided as a vague description of what general steps would be required to setup a chroot to help you decide if you the option interesting. If you decide to go this route you should follow a more precise guide. \nStep #1:\nSetup another partition with an Ubuntu installation and install the application you want.\nStep #2:\nIn your regular Ubuntu install type: \"sudo mount /dev/sda1/mnt/thechrootfolder\" (you will need to adjust this code to lead to the 2nd Ubuntu installation)\nStep #3:\nIn your regular Ubuntu install type: \"sudo mount --bind /dev/media/sda1/dev\" (you are trying to mount your regular installs dev folder)\nIn your regular Ubuntu install type: \"sudo mount --bind /proc/media/sda1/proc\"\nIn your regular Ubuntu install type: \"sudo mount --bind /sys/media/sda1/sys\"\nStep #4:\nIn regular Ubuntu install type: \"sudo cp /etc/resolv.conf /2ndubuntuinstalllocation/etc/resolv.conf\" (This is needed to have dns function required for accessing the internet)\nStep #5:\nIn regular Ubuntu install type: \"sudo xhost +\" this will allow all users to access the xserver of the curren user which is needed so that when you launch the application it can open in your current xserver. (WHILE EFFECTIVE THIS IS NOT A SAFE WAY TO DO THIS BECAUSE ANY LOCAL USER CAN ACCESS THE CURRENT USERS XSERVER!!! YOU SHOULD ALWAYS RESTRICT ACCESS.)\nStep #6:\nIn regular Ubuntu install type: \"sudo chroot /2ndinstalllocaiton (this is you entering the other installation). Now in the terminal type the code to launch the desired application (it will be running from the other OS but appear in your regular installs xserver).\n\nA: With a bit of work, you could install and run Steam in an unprivileged LXC container (details here) to keep it from accessing your filesystem and running processes.  There would be no noticeable performance loss with this approach.\nYou might also consider running Steam in Docker.

I want to install upstart to my ubuntu server 13.10, but I am confused if I need to download the source or install package. In upstart's getting started page I think they instruct to install the source.\nBut here and here they seem to say that upstart is included with later distributions. I tried initctl in the shell and I got missing command error. Does this mean I need to install it from source? I am new to ubuntu so I would appreciate if you can explain how I can install upstart.\n\nA: You do have upstart installed. In fact, the webpage you linked reads: Ubuntu has had upstart installed as a replacement for init scripts since as far back as 2006, but it hasn’t yet been really used until the latest beta release of Karmic (Ubuntu 9.10). and Upstart home page lists Ubuntu 6.10 and later as using Upstart.\nTo learn initctl usage, type initctl --help or man initctl.\nThe message\nuser@ubuntu:~$ initctl\ninitctl: missing command\nTry `initctl --help' for more information.\n\nis printed by initctl and implies that it is installed and executable, otherwise the shell would rather print initctl: command not found.

If I had found this earlier I might have a dual boot machine.  As it was I jumped in the deep end and just replaced windows with ubuntu.\n\nA: You should not disable UEFI support!!!! Although it may initially appear to let you make progress, setting the computer to favor BIOS/CSM/legacy-mode booting is more likely to cause additional problems than to solve problems. The reason is that mixing the existing EFI-mode Windows boot with a BIOS/CSM/legacy-mode boot of Linux ranges from impossible to awkward, depending on your computer. The most probable outcome of installing Linux in BIOS/CSM/legacy mode alongside an existing EFI-mode installation is that you'll have to play games with boot loaders after the installation, effectively undoing the BIOS/CSM/legacy-mode boot loader installation that was created by changing that firmware setting. In other words, you'll create work for yourself. Unfortunately, this bizarre path has become a popular one because people keep repeating the same advice, which involves both the use of a BIOS/CSM/legacy-mode installation followed by use of Boot Repair to fix the problems that the first bit of advice caused.\nThat said, you may need to disable Secure Boot, though, so go ahead and do that. Unfortunately, the details of how to do this vary from one computer to another.\nI recommend you read the following pages for help:\n\n\n*\n\n*My page on EFI-mode Linux installations\n\n*The Ubuntu wiki on UEFI installations\nIf you continue to have problems after following the advice on those pages, post back with details of what's happening.\n", "Q: Startup Disk Creator not recognizing selected ISO in 13.10 I recently downloaded the Lubuntu 12.04 LTS ISO for Power PC (I want to install it on an old iBook G4), but when I go to select the ISO in Startup Disk Creator, it just remains blank in the Source disc image (.iso) or CD: area. \nHere is the screenshot from before (and it looks the same afterwards) selecting the ISO. \n\nAs you can see, the ISO is on the desktop separate from any other ISOs, IMGs, etc.\nI read this question: Startup Disk Creator is not showing the ISO image, but that didn't help. Neither did Startup disc creator not allowing any iso to be loaded or Why isn't Startup Disk Creator working in 12.04?.\nTwo of those are 12.04 and one is 12.10, so they are both not my version, if that changes anything.\nDoes anyone have any clue why this is? I am going to attempt it with Unetbootin and if that fails, manually via the terminal and dd.\n\nA: I found a \"fix\"\n \nStartup Disk Creator looks in the Downloads directory by default. If finds any ISOs it sticks and will only let you use that ISO with the highest number and Ubuntu in its name. I solve this by moving ALL the ISOs from my Download directory in another directory. Startup Disck Creator can't default to any ISO so it comes up blank. It will then let you select ISO's from other directories as normal. \n \nMy exact process is: \n1. Move all ISOs from ~/Downloads to ~/Downloads/ISOs  \n2. Run Startup Disk Creator, Source table will be blank  \n3. Click Other...  \n4. Open ISOs from any location as normal (in my case ~/Downloads/ISOs) \n \nHope this helps\n\n \nThis is only based on my computers running 12.04.4. Your mileage may differ.\n\nA: Yes, It is irritating that the .iso files are NOT being identified, certainly a bug.\nRename the .iso file to end with .img, and the usb-creator-gtk(startup disk creator) would identify it.\nmv something.iso something.img\nFiled https://bugs.launchpad.net/bugs/1931493\n\nA: It appears that the \"Startup Disk Creator\" doesn't allow you to select corrupted .iso files. \nTo check if your .iso file is not corrupted, match the output of:\nmd5sum <downloaded>.iso\nwith the corresponding has here. If there's a mismatch, you're file is corrupted.\n\nA: Another option is to use the \"Disks\" application (a.k.a gnome-disk-utility, a.k.a. gnome-disks) which comes preinstalled with Ubuntu running Gnome (17.10 and up).

However, it still wouldn't open until I renamed it to .img\n\nA: Not a solution but as an alternative, you could try unetbootin:\nhttp://unetbootin.sourceforge.net/\nIt recognized any kind of bootable iso I've tested, even FreeBSD and other *NIX.\nIf you don't like installing it from the bundle in the website, you can add this ppa:\nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:gezakovacs/ppa\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get install unetbootin\n\n", "Q: Shuffling is not working The shuffling to form the play queuelist is not working. I use Banshee 2.6.1 Apparently the frequency of songs is independent of their rating. The best rated songs should be more frequent. I've tried reinstalling. How to fix it?\n\nA: When the list is shuffled, all songs are shuffled with an even chance. Think about it like this, when you shuffle a deck of cards, the cards have no way of getting to the top of the deck even if your chances of winning would be increased. Also, with song shuffling, it is performed randomly.

I had to disable it to use on my linux machines.  Sorry I do not have more detail but hopefully this is another avenue for your troubleshooting.\n\nA: I had a similar issue at first, but it was just because my laptop PC was in a docking station and I was plugging the Seagate drive into one of the laptop's usb ports. When I plugged it in to a usb port on the docking station, it showed up in ubuntu 13.04's launcher bar with no problem, mounted on /media/username/Seagate\\ Backup\\ Plus\\ Drive/\nMy guess is that it's an issue with the power supplied by the usb port.

As part of my custom (in-house) .deb file that will be deployed to Ubuntu 12.04 devices, I need to add several PPA repositories, run apt-get update, and then install packages from those PPAs.\nCan this be done within the .preinst or .postinst scripts in my .deb file?\nI assume that when my .deb file is installed (sudo dpkg -i testing.deb) that some locks or mechanisms likely exist which would prevent me from calling certain commands such as add-apt-repository, apt-get update, and apt-get install.\nIs this a correct assumption?\n\nA: You are correct. Maintainer scripts are not supposed to make any changes to the apt or dpkg states, other than the changes that will be made when installing the package anyway.\nInstalling a file into /etc/apt/sources.list.d, though, is fine. Most packages that fill a role like \"install this package to add the APT repository X to your system\" simply do that (as opposed to calling add-apt-repository). It's also common to drop the GPG public key used to sign the repo into /etc/apt/trusted.gpg.d.\nIf you want to make it simple for the user to perform the additional installation steps for your software, you might just want to ship a script which does the job, and tell the user to run the script manually.\nBut if you really, really want to call apt-get update or apt-get install, etc automatically, and you don't mind that your package will be wholly unacceptable in Debian or Ubuntu proper, and your users are ok with the package acting that way, then you could perhaps put something in /etc/cron.d which checks for any existing apt or dpkg locks, and if none are held, performs your additional installation steps and arranges for those steps not to be performed again. I don't recommend that approach.\n\nA: Yes, you should not do this -- but if you have to -- here is how\nyou could call apt-get from inside preinst script. The same approach would work for calling dpkg directly.\nThe idea is to launch a subshell which patiently waits in the background until all install activity has ended and then does its thing.\n((\n   # wait for install to finish\n   while pgrep -x 'dpkg|apt|apt-get' > /dev/null; do sleep 1; done\n   export DEBIAN_FRONTEND=noninteractive\n   # make sure no one else is locking the dpkg database\n   flock --exclusive --close /var/lib/dpkg/lock \\\n       apt-get install --assume-yes my-fancy-package\n) 2>&1 >/dev/null </dev/null &)\n\nObviously this will cause problems if there are multiple packages which try this trick. So as I said above, you should really not do this.\n", "Q: Keeping a Clean Home Folder I installed n (node.js version manager) recently, as well as npm, and node.js. I can't tell which program is to blame, but there are tmp, local, share,  and bin folders in my home folder as well as a README and LICENSE AGREEMENT.\nThis doesn't strike me as a clean home folder anymore.

They do not install in the sense that all users can use the stuff but in the sense that \"this is my project, keep all this stuff together\". Some programs include removal methods using npm as example:\nnpm uninstall module_name\n\nand done. If you use -g or global you must use -g too. For other tools they include their own removal method or you just can remove manually the directories.\n", "Q: Script for running Exe on all files in different sub folders and for capturing the output in text file I have an exe file which takes .jpg as input and returns 4 values as output on the console. \nI have many directories and in each of them I have some images.

I tried using pacmd, but to no avail.\nI have seen it working in Ubuntu 12.04.3 LTS, when a colleague installed it on the S210. And in that case 2 mics were listed in the sound setting.\nIf you plug in a headset with a mic, you'll see that it works, cause that's what it's set to.\nOddly, if I launch pavucontrol, and set it to microphone, it will work while it is open. But it won't stick.\n", "Q: Rsync mirror specific Ubuntu distributions How do I mirror specific Ubuntu distributions using Rsync?\nFor example, using apt-mirror I would have the following lines so I would only have the package for 12.04\ndeb (mirror address)/ubuntu precise main restricted universe multiverse\ndeb (mirror address)/ubuntu precise-security main restricted universe multiverse\ndeb (mirror address)/ubuntu precise-updates main restricted universe multiverse\n\ndeb-amd64 (mirror address)/ubuntu precise main restricted universe multiverse\ndeb-amd64 (mirror address)/ubuntu precise-security main restricted universe multiverse\ndeb-amd64 (mirror address)/ubuntu precise-updates main restricted universe multiverse\n\ndeb-i386 (mirror address)/ubuntu precise main restricted universe multiverse\ndeb-i386 (mirror address)/ubuntu precise-security main restricted universe multiverse\ndeb-i386 (mirror address)/ubuntu precise-updates main restricted universe multiverse\n\n\nA: apt-mirror does the same task you are trying to achieve: it downloads new packages from repository, and delete old ones, so rsync will probably not do better than that.\n", "Q: An alternative to init.d?
