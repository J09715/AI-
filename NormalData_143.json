OS is Ubuntu 12.04 with all updates to current date. \nI am getting a peculiar issue since about 2 weeks - when I browse a HTML5/CSS3 website in Chrome, sometimes (randomly) the system freezes - mouse, keyboard nothing seems to work. Ctrl-Alt-Del wouldn't work. The mouse pointer moves but clicking doesn't do anything. There is no such issue in Firefox. Only Chrome on Ubuntu has the problem. \n\nA: As nothing seemed to work, I was doing a cold restart (power switch). \nThen, today I referred to this troubleshooting wiki: What should I do when Ubuntu freezes? and pressed Ctrl-Alt-F1, which worked to get the TTY1 session. Logged in as root and checked memory usage with top. Noticed that one instance of Chrome was using over 700 MB and another instance of Chrome was randomly coming up with usage of over 900 MB. \nI pressed Ctrl-Alt-F7 to check the graphical desktop and surprisingly the graphical session is working now.

While I'm waiting for a Windows 8 OEM disc to get here in the mail, I decided to tinker around in Ubuntu 12.04 LTS. \nI've been teaching myself a little C++ lately, and on Windows, for lack of a better option, I just was using Visual Studio C++ Express 2010. Obviously, I couldn't use this IDE on Ubuntu, so I tried to install Eclipse. I wanted it to be able to compile both Java and C++ applications, so first I installed eclipse-java-juno-SR2-linux-gtk.tar.gz from http://www.eclipse.org/downloads/ (It was the 3rd from the top.) Everything compiled and ran just fine in the Java perspective.\nWhen I tried to install the C/C++ Developer Tools, things started going awry. First I tried installing the plugin from the Help > Add New Software... menu. It said everything downloaded correctly, and after restarting Eclipse, my hello world program failed with the error Launch failed. Binary not found. This error was really cryptic, and didn't even give me an error number, so I tried removing Eclipse and re-installing Eclipse again, this time the option with CDT built in: eclipse-cpp-juno-SR2-linux-gtk.tar.gz, again from http://www.eclipse.org/downloads/ . \nThis time when everything started up, I tried running a hello world program, but it underlined all of my std's and cout's with an error saying something was unresolved (I don't remember what it said exactly because I have since taken the CDT version back off and re-installed the Java version, which still works fine. \nAlso, at some point along the way I was having this error: Eclipse Juno C++ error: Program \"g++\" not found in PATH which I never managed to solve before I uninstalled back to just having Java support.\nI could really use some help here, and if you could explain some of the in-depth Linux jargon that you use, that'd be great too as I've only been using Ubuntu for less than 36 hours.\n\nA: I'm not exactly sure why this worked, when I went through the C++ project wizard and got to the final slide reading \"Configure the Cross GCC path and prefix\", I left the prefix blank and set the path to /usr/bin/g++.

I want to uninstall libreoffice. This program consists of about three dozen modules.

So the expression libreoffice.* matches any package name containing the string libreoffice, followed by any number of characters.\n\n*Surround the regular expression with single quotes to avoid the shell interpreting the asterisk. (If you had a file named libreoffice.example for example in your current directory, the shell would replace libreoffice.* with libreoffice.example, so you have to use single quotes to stop this behaviour.)\nResult:\nsudo apt-get remove 'libreoffice.*'\n\n\nA: An alternative is:\ndpkg -l | grep libreoffice | awk '{print $2}' | xargs -n1 echo\n\nThis will list out all the packages matching libreoffice. When you've confirmed that they're all the ones you wish to get rid of, run the following command... with caution:\ndpkg -l | grep libreoffice | awk '{print $2}' | xargs -n1 sudo apt-get purge -y\n\nThe idea:\n\n\n*\n\n*Get the system to list out all installed packages\n\n*Filter to show only the ones matching libreoffice\n\n*Filter to show only the column with the package name\n\n*Run the purge command on each of those packages\n\n\nA: When you need to remove many files having the same prefix, I find brace expansion very handy:\nsudo apt remove libreoffice-l10n-{bg,ca,cs,da,de,en-za,es,fr,hu,id,ja,ko,nb,nl,pl,pt,ru,sv,th,tr,uk,vi,zh-cn,zh-tw}\n\nI used this command to remove all the language packs that I never use. Yes, with a regex you can tell which one to keep, and delete the others.

If so, how to check?\n\n\n*\n\n*My router's got the latest firmware.\n\n*My modem's brand new (mfg a year ago in a Chinese sweatshop for Cisco) and from what I can tell the firmware's up-to-scratch here, too.\n\n*In Win XP, the latest updates are installed from Micro$oft and from the Lenovo \"ThinkVantage\" System Update tool.\n\n*Ubuntu Software Center has all the latest (LTS) updates installed.\n\n*I also connected it to the modem directly: internet on Ubuntu was as slow (or even slower) than when connected through the router.\n\n*Currently, there are no other devices connected to the router and currently online (i.e., the bandwidth is currently not being shared; and no, this router does not support wifi).\nWhich drivers and/or settings could I possible (and sensibly and safely) tweak within Ubuntu?\n\nFor older Q&A's see, for instance:\n\n\n*\n\n*Internet slow on Ubuntu but not windows using a RTL8111\n\n*Ubuntu restricting download speed to 15kbps\n\n*Why is my download speed slow on Ubuntu 11.10?\n\n*Ubuntu 11.10 network speed\n\n*Slow internet browsing in Ubuntu\nNote that I didn't yet test the suggestions on How to check Internet Speed via Terminal? but instead relied (for now) on the (seemingly quite reliable) speedtest.net.\n\nEdit\nDon't take the above values as carved in stone. I do not claim to have performed robust, standardized or extensive benchmark testing. There is significant measurement error involved, which (to my knowledge) cannot be avoided entirely. I shall update my findings, if I happen to discover or test something new. In particular, I shall keep an eye out for the top speed reached surfing with Ubuntu (relative to > 40 Mbps with Win XP) on this machine/network.\n\nA: It could be the duplex of your ethernet port conflicting with your switch/router.  You can check this by using \"ethtool\".\nIf \"eth0\" is the ethernet port you're using, run:\nsudo /sbin/ethtool eth0\n...and look for a line that says \"Duplex:\".  Most modern home switches/routers will support \"Full\" duplex and that should be the most optimal setting.  The other possible would be \"Half\".\nRegardless of the value, you can change to the other by running:\nsudo /sbin/ethtool -s eth0 full\nwhich sets the port to full duplex.  To force half duplex, run:\nsudo /sbin/ethtool -s eth0 half\nConfirm by running the first ethtool command, then re-run your speed tests.\n\nA: Its possible your only getting half duplex under Ubuntu. What network card and module are you using?\nAlso make sure your DNS settings are the same as in Windows, could be name resolution taking longer and making it appear slower.\n\nA: I'm not an experienced user but as you can see in the image.:\n\nI've got the same connection.\nThat happened to me while using an old Ubuntu version, and the problem was that my computer wireless USB adapter was 802.11g. When I change it to 802.11n the problem was solved (its possible you only need to adapt the drivers).\nI know that with your computer knowledge this could be a stupid answer, but consider my intereset on helping.\n\nA: Well, Ubuntu isn't to blame, there can be something with your router.  The OS doesn't slow down internet connection. Check firewall settings, IP settings, DNS,  and see if you have the latest NIC drivers.\nAlso try turning off internet sharing by unchecking Available to all users.  I just tried it, ans it made a difference.  To do so see below:\n\n\n\nWith the option Unchecked\n\nWith the option Checked\n\n\nDownload speed has virtually nothing to do with a computer's\nprocessing power. Assuming your computer is able to run whatever\noperating system you're running and that it has a 10/100 ethernet\nport, your download speeds won't be affected any further by anything\non that machine. Download speeds are affected mostly by the server\nyou're connecting to and however busy the network traffic between you\nand that server is, and obviously the speed of your connection you're\npaying your internet service provider for.1\nOS is nothing to deal with your download speed. This concerns on your\ninternet connection or ISP, your device that you're using in your PC\nfor internet access (example: LAN and Modem, Network Setup, Router\n(the setup), Wireless Devices, and many more), and the bandwidth speed\nthat your ISP gave you to access different location using your\ninternet (means that different Server Speed or Location-Range will\naffect your DL Speed). But, some softwares like Web Browser, Download\nManager, and other programs that affects your access in the internet\nhave a effect too, but the effect is less than what you expected.1\n\n\n\nWhat Affects Speed? Every web page you view or file downloaded from the Internet is handled by dozens of computers before it appears\non your screen. And the speed you receive from the Internet is\ndetermined by the slowest “link” in the data chain leading to your\ncomputer. Below, are some factors that can affect the speed of your\nBroadband connection.\nThe Host Server The most common cause of slow speed on the Internet is the host server. This server may be miss-configured or\nunderpowered for the number of people using it at the same time. A\nslow server can affect anything you do on the Internet.\nAd-aware or Spy-ware If your computer is infected with \"ad-aware\" or \"spy-ware\" you will likely see reduced computer performance and a\nconstant stream of pop-up ads. This will likely cause everything on\nyour computer to work slower.\nWeb Browser A corrupted or poorly configured web browser is one of the most common bottlenecks for fast web browsing.\nYour TCP/IP Configuration Installation software provided by dial-up Internet providers and satellite companies can change the\ndefault TCP/IP settings on your computer in an attempt to provide\nbetter performance. These changes usually cause poorer performance\nwith high-speed Internet services and should be uninstalled.\n\nHaving a good knowledge of DNS and how to change your settings, can speed up your connection.\n\nYour Computer Hardware The speed of the processor, hard drive, network card, graphics accelerator, even the amount of RAM, all impact\nthe speed your computer can process Internet data.\nYour Operating System With extensive use, any computer operating system can become corrupted, inefficient or miss-configured, which\nwill affect the speed.  (User Responsibility)\nYour Home Networking Device A home networking device, or router, routes traffic between your cable modem and your computer(s). Routers\nthat don't use 100baseT Ethernet standards or outdated software could\nslow your connection.\nYour Modem's Signal If the Modem signal delivered to your cable/dsl modem is too strong, too weak or too noisy, it can cause\nyour Modem to slow down or stop working entirely. Any changes to\nyour line, inside or outside, could also slow your modem signal.\nType of Connection The most important determining factor for Internet speed is the type of Internet connection you have. You can\npurchase Internet service at different levels of speeds, depending\nupon what the provider offers. Normally speeds range from 1.5\nmegabytes per second to 6 megabytes per second, which are the download\nand upload times that it takes the Internet to send and receive\ninformation.\nTime of Day For many types of Internet, such as those that are connected through phone lines or coaxial cables, the time of day can\nbe a factor. Modem-based Internet and DSL are both shared network\nsystems---meaning that if many people within your neighborhood are\nusing the Internet, it can slow down your Internet connection due to\nclogged bandwidth, which is responsible for data transmission.\nComputer Memory Even if you purchase a higher speed of Internet service, you can only utilize these higher speeds if your computer has\nthe capabilities. One major speed factor within the computer is the\namount of memory---or RAM---that it has. RAM is responsible for\ntemporarily storing a computer's instructions. Lack of RAM means that\na computer must store instructions on the hard drive, which takes\nlonger to execute.\nProcessor Speed The processor speed---or the speed at which your computer executes and transfers instructions---is the other aspect\nthat defines the speed of the computer, as well as its Internet\nconnection. If you have a high Internet speed, but don't have a high\nenough processor speed, the computer won't be able to execute\ninstructions fast, resulting in a slower speed of Internet\ninteraction.\nVirus Another possible threat that can slow down Internet speed is a virus. If you don't have a good virus protector installed, then\nviruses can infect your computer, which can cause a tremendous\ndecrease in the speed at which all operations are performed, including\nthe Internet connection.2\n\n1Source:Gendou\n2Sources:MTC ehow\n", "Q: How to set java home?

I used pavucontrol to disable sound on my laptop and play it through the tv. I changed it back when I was done. Can't remember if I used it right away. Last night I tried to use it and it didn't work. I opened pavucontrol again and switched to the configuration tab where there had previously been a drop down menu allowing me to choose what device to output my sound through. Now there's nothing. It says no card available for configuration. When I open asoundconf-gtk it only has \"PCH\" and selecting that does nothing either.\nHere is my output of pulseaudio -d http://pastebin.com/75SpLihg\nAnd using the guide on the Ubuntu Wiki Pulse Audio page, I made a log http://pastebin.com/rmARXUMD\nI've tried deleting the pulse folder from my home directory and restarting the server. After searching on Google, I found similar problems required me to edit /etc/pulse/client.conf and make sure autospawn is set to yes and everything is commented out with a semicolon, which it is.

You need to configure the router that assigns the IP to any of the 2 to assign a different range for one of them. For example, assign the LAN or WLAN the range 192.168.2.X, so when you have both connected they are in different IP Ranges. \nThe problem here is that when you have both of them connected and both get, either the same IP address or same IP address range (Assigned from a DHCP Router), the computer thinks you are connecting to the same LAN network and does not know where to get information for the network card, so when you try to send a package, it does not know which network card to use since both point to the same IP range.\nChanging the pool of IPs you can assign on one of the network cards will solve the issue. Here is an image of how my router looks on the page where I would change the pool of IPs:\n \nAs you can see, on the section of your Router where it manages the DHCP service (You should have it enabled since you are getting assigned those IP), simply change the IP Address of your router to another range and then change the IPs assigned by DHCP. In this case for example, if I wanted to change this to 192.168.10.X I would first change the IP Address of the router to the same IP Range I am going to use for the computer, this way I make sure it will be accessible after the changes are made. So I would change where it says 192.168.1.1 to 192.168.10.1.\nThen on the \"start IP Address\" (It might look different in your Router) I would change the 192.168.1.2 to 192.168.10.2. Of course in my case it does this last change automatically after changing the Routers IP, but just in case in another Router it does not, then you know which 2 steps to do. Now simply save the new configuration so you can get the new IP assigned to your LAN or WLAN device and enjoy having both network cards working at the same time.\n", "Q: fglrx vs open drivers - informations and temperature control I have ubuntu 12.04.2 and kde.

How to fix? First Off I'm using Ubuntu 12.04 on a laptop with a built in card reader.\nI have a sandisk 8Gig micro sd card that came with my HTC Desire HD phone.\nUnfortunately I had mounted it to a windows computer at work via a usb cable attached to the phone and didn't \"safely remove hardware\". This was not the first time I didn't \"safely remove\" it from windows and each time I accidentally did so, I had to restart my phone before the sd card was accessible again.\nIt must have worn out something though because now my phone won't recognize the card at all and when I put it into my laptop's card reader I get the following errors in /var/log/syslog\nApr  4 21:17:59 jesse-laptop kernel: [12665.532025] mmc0: error -110 whilst initialising SD card\nApr  4 21:18:00 jesse-laptop kernel: [12667.192024] mmc0: error -110 whilst initialising SD card\nApr  4 21:18:02 jesse-laptop kernel: [12668.860020] mmc0: error -110 whilst initialising SD card\nApr  4 21:18:04 jesse-laptop kernel: [12670.532020] mmc0: error -110 whilst initialising SD card\n\nI have googled this message but can't find anywhere that explains what it means. All of the posts regarding similar errors that I found are about getting card readers to work, but my card reader works perfectly when I insert a different sd card.\nApr  4 21:26:35 jesse-laptop kernel: [13182.192121] mmc0: new SDHC card at address b368\nApr  4 21:26:35 jesse-laptop kernel: [13182.195849] mmcblk0: mmc0:b368       29.8 GiB \nApr  4 21:26:35 jesse-laptop kernel: [13182.197931]  mmcblk0: p1\n\nSo I know the problem is with the damaged card not the reader.\nThe problem seems to be with initializing the card because it doesn't appear under /dev/ anywhere I can find. When I insert a working SD card it appears as /dev/mmcblk0 & the partition is /dev/mmcblk0p1.\nNeedless to say I can't format the card or run any recovery software until I can get it to appear as a device.\nEdit: - I have discovered by looking at my syslog relevant parts available here that when I first inserted my card the error was different to what it is now. I don't really understand any of these errors. I'm guessing the card was left in a state of anticipating a transfer (if that's possible) and it didn't receive it. Now it can't be initialized (whatever that actually means)\nAny help regarding what this error means and/or how to recover data from my sd card is very much appreciated. Most of my important data was backed up but there was one note taking application (on my phone) that wasn't and I'd like very much to retrieve that data.\nP.S. Both the working card and the damaged card are micro sd and I'm using a card adapter to insert them into my computer.\nP.P.S. I've uploaded an annotated version of my /var/log/syslog with just the relevant parts here and also the full syslog here\n\nA: It looks like the card has been damaged due to premature removal. The messages indicate either a controller failure in the card or bad blocks. The latter may be recoverable. Try this to recover:\n\n*\n\n*Insert card\n\n*Unmount it with umount /dev/mmc0 (or with whatever the drive is mounted as)\n\n*fsck -v /dev/mmc0\n\n*mount it\n\nIf this doesn't help, you have to reformat with mkfs.\nIf the card is still unusable, the controller has probably been damaged in hardware beyond recovery.\n\nA: Try using gparted to create a new partition table. Open gparted from the Dash or with gksu gparted in a terminal, then select your device, and go to Device -> New Partition Table.\n", "Q: \"MediaTomb UI is disabled. Check your configuration.\" What could I be forgetting? Upon initial installation of mediatomb I receive the following message: \n\nMediaTomb UI is disabled. Check your configuration.\n\nWhat could I be missing on this configuration?\n\nA: I haven't used it in a while, but documentation specified an IP address you need to enter in your web-browser. This takes you to a web-based configuration page where you can tell it where your media is.\n\nA: I just figured this out for myself. \nMy problem arised from when I transferred a config.xml file from an older computer to a newer one. Come to find out the service mediatomb reads the config.xml file located i the /etc/mediatomb directory, and when the config.xml file in ~/.mediatomb is replace it no longer has the same information in the /etc dir as the ~/ dir. \nWith a little deductive reasoning I concluded the config.xml located ~/.mediatomb must be a hard link to the /etc/mediatomb/config.xml file. So cd into /etc/mediatomb, sudo rm config.xml, then sudo ln ~/.mediatomb/config.xml should produce the correct results, then just restart the service. In list format:\ncd /etc/mediatomb; sudo rm config.xml; sudo ln ~/.mediatomb/config.xml; sudo service mediatomb restart; exit\nOtherwise if you have a new install check the ~/.mediatomb/config.xml file with nano and confirm ui enabled is in fact enabled. List format\nnano ~/.mediatomb/config.xml \nctrl+w \"ui enabled\" \nchange no to yes \nctrl+x \ny \nenter\nHopes this helps people looking for this answer, happy hacking\n\nA: I did a fresh install of MediaTomb on Peppermint 4, based on Ubuntu 13.04, and also got \"MediaTomb UI is disabled. Check your configuration.\" I fixed this by editting ~/.mediatomb/config.xml and changing the line:\n<accounts enabled=\"no\" session-timeout=\"30\">\n\nto\n<accounts enabled=\"yes\" session-timeout=\"30\">\n\nI also inserted\n<port>49152</port>\n\nimmediately after the line containig just <server> as I found a service restart command was too fast, and the port had not finished closing when the restart was issued. Mediatomb will use the next available port in this case - but it means you won't see the web page unless you chase the port number up!\nI finished off by running the following: \nsudo mv /etc/mediatomb/config.xml /etc/mediatomb/config.xml.bak\nsudo cp ~/.mediatomb/config.xml /etc/mediatomb/config.xml\nsudo service mediatomb restart\n\nThis stopped me getting \"page note found\" in the browser and, when it did display the login page, username mediatomb with password mediatomb would not work.\nHope this helps someone as I spent a lot of time on it.\n", "Q: How do I properly install and configure MediaTomb? How do I properly install and configure MediaTomb? Is there an easier app that I should try instead?\n\nA: Please note that the mediatomb runs as a service.\nYou can enable/disable the service by using the following steps:\nA) \n1. Install BootUp Manager:\n    sudo apt-get install bum\n2. Execute BootUp Manager:\n    sudo bum\n3. Disable/enable mediatomb service\nB) Start/stop mediatomb service manually\n    sudo service mediatomb start\n    sudo service mediatomb stop\n    sudo service mediatomb restart\nC) Enable UI\n    See following Ubuntu guide: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/MediaTomb\nD) More documentation\n    Of course, there is also official MediaTomb site: http://mediatomb.cc/pages/documentation_overview\nE) External drive\n- If you're using Ubuntu 12.10 and external drive, the drive is mapped in /media/$USER/\n- MediaTomb service runs under \"mediatomb\" user by default\n- However, external drive (when connected and mounted) has access rights to your current $USER\nE.1) \n=> mediatomb service (UI) is not allowed seeing the folders/files\n- there are several ways how to bypass this situation. I managed to startup the mediatomb as \"Startup application\" when I log in to my account. So yes, I'm not using the mediatomb service and the \"mediatomb process\" is running also under my account.\n- From my point of view, this is safer at least from the access rights point of view.\nE.2) Another possible approach is running the mediatomb service under different user (you).\nMaybe there are also other ways...\n", "Q: GPU lockup on nvidia GeForce 8200m G I have recently installed 12.04 LTS on an old Toshiba Satellite A215 which works just fine.  I am attempting to load Ubuntu on an MSI CR600 with a GeForce 8200m G video controller (I am trying to dump Microsoft once and for all).

They appear to be ok in thunar and nautilus for the same files/directories.\nHow can I make emblems appear in desktop?\nI use Xubuntu 12.10 and xfce 4.12.\n\nA: The short answer is that you can't show emblems on icons on the desktop with the normal xfdesktop package at the present time, although there is a development patch available. On Xfce, xfdesktop actually manages the desktop and not thunar, the filemanager. If you go to settings > settings-manager > desktop > icons, there are few options to tweak the desktop icon setup, but no other hidden ones within xfconf-query under xfce4-desktop. It is possible to show thumbnails of items on the desktop because thumbnailing on Xfce is managed by default by another service called tumbler and not by xfdesktop or thunar by themselves.\nHowever, there is a development patch for custom emblems at Xfce.org. Eric Koegel wrote in the patch summary that it:\n\nAdds support to display multiple custom emblems for file icons on\n  the desktop. Regular file icons will display whether it's a symlink\n  or the file is read-only in addition to any emblems the user sets\n  in Thunar. This requires an optional dependency on libtdb to read\n  the metadata for the user set emblems.\n\nYou must use git to clone the source, as the patch is set up to work with the source directly from git.\n(This was tested with on Ubuntu 12.04 with the Xfce 4.10 and 4.12 ppas applied, not with the stock Precise version, so it should work on 12.10 and later also)\nPlease Note: The feature is very experimental, so it is up to you if you want to try it, and perhaps report back upstream if you have problems.\nsudo apt-get install libtdb1 libtdb-dev git build-essential checkinstall xfce4-dev-tools\nsudo apt-get build-dep xfdesktop4\ngit clone git://git.xfce.org/xfce/xfdesktop\ncd xfdesktop\nwget \"https://bugzilla.xfce.org/attachment.cgi?id=4391\" --output-document=xfdesktop4.patch\npatch -p1 < xfdesktop4.patch\n./autogen.sh --prefix=/usr\nmake\nsudo apt-get autoremove --purge xfdesktop4 xfdesktop4-data \nsudo checkinstall --pkgversion=4.10.3\n\nNote: When the configure has finished, you should get this message (see the icon emblems part):\nBuild Configuration:\n* Build desktop menu module:                    yes\n* Build support for desktop icons:              yes\n      Include support for file/launcher icons:  yes\n      Include support for icon emblems:         yes\n* Special treatment for mount points on UNIX:   yes\n* Mount notification support:                   yes\n\nNow after installation run xfdesktop --version and you will get:\nBuilt with GTK+ 2.24.10, linked with GTK+ 2.24.10.\nBuild options:\n    Desktop Menu:        enabled\n    Desktop Icons:       enabled\n    Desktop File Icons:  enabled\n    Custom Icon Emblems: enabled\n\nLastly, logout and login again, as xfdesktop --reload won't be enough, and the emblems should be there. If xfdesktop is not running when you log back in, enter xfdesktop & and it will start. For a more permanent solution, add it as a startup item, as it should be starting up on login.\nBe aware that this is development code (both the patch and the git code) and hasn't been classed as a stable version, so it might not always work as expected, but this is about all that is possible at the minute. Also, when you get a later version through any updates, it may remove your patched version unless you pin the version in apt settings.\nI have experimented with the new version of xfdesktop and successfully returned to the old version by simply removing the package installed with checkinstall- it will be called something like xfdesktop4.10.3, but just type xfdesktop and press tab until the package appears. As an example, you could use\nsudo apt-get autoremove --purge xfdesktop_4.10.3\n\nThen just reinstall xfdesktop4 and xfdesktop4-data. The xfdesktop package is obviously not as critical as a window manager, but perhaps experiment on a virtual machine beforehand if you wish. \nI can say that the emblems are quite small, although the symlink symbol can just be seen, although not all emblems appear, so it is clearly a very experimental feature. Emblems appeared on file icons, but not on folder icons. \n", "Q: NAS Raid 5 Recovery using mdadm: volume and mount issues, please help Hello this is my first foray into ubuntu, or any form of Linix for that matter, as well as my first attempt to ever recover a lost a raid, but I'm a fairly quick study. I have an 8TB WD Sharespace, four  2TB drives set up on Raid 5 with two \"failed\" (maybe not) drives. I'm desperate to recover my data. Aside from all the music and movies and games etc, all my photos and home videos of my children growing up are on this thing and I'm fairly desperate to recover them. Aside from preferring to do things myself I can't afford professional data recovery. I do not have back-up drives to copy my originals and I can't afford them so I'm stuck trying to do this myself with the original disks. Any help is appreciated.\nForgive me if I over explain as I'm not really sure what's relevant and what isn't as I'm trying to figure this out. I believe the controller in my NAS has failed and the data is actually still intact on the drives. I've pulled all four drives out of the NAS and put them in order in my comp disconnected my normal HDD's and am using the Live CD in try mode to run Ubuntu. I've been trying to do this thus far using this guide: HOWTO:Sharespace Raid 5 Data Recovery, but I've run into a few snags along the way and the entire forum is closed so I can't ask questions there.\nThe first thing I did was to set myself at the root user and check to make sure all my drives were in the right place and recognized.

YAY!... sort of...\nvgscan\n\nNo volume groups found\n\nBoo... So back to scouring the internet I found a post where someone was having a similar problem and had to recreate their volume and local groups to successfully access their data. Using the names for the volume groups and local groups from the guide I was using I created them using the new commands I found:\nvgcreate vg0 /dev/md0\n\nand\nlvcreate -L5.45T -n lv0 vg0\n\nboth reported being created and all seemed good in the world. Until, going back to my guide I tried to mount it:\nmkdir /mnt/raid\nmount -t auto /dev/vg0/lv0 /mnt/raid\nmount: you must specify the filesystem type\n\nApparently \"auto\" doesn't work like the guide said. Poking around the net I've found a couple filesystem types ext3 and ext 4 so I tried them too:\nmount -t ext3 /dev/vg0/lv0 /mnt/raid\nmount: wrong fs type, bad option, bad superblock on /dev/mapper/vg0-lv0,\n       missing codepage or helper program, or other error\n       In some cases useful info is found in syslog - try\n       dmesg | tail  or so\n\nand\nmount -t ext4 /dev/vg0/lv0 /mnt/raid\nmount: wrong fs type, bad option, bad superblock on /dev/mapper/vg0-lv0,\n       missing codepage or helper program, or other error\n       In some cases useful info is found in syslog - try\n       dmesg | tail  or so\n\nAs you can see neither worked... So after several hours more of searching I've come to the conclusion that I really need to ask for help. If anyone has any suggestions, or advice, or even better knows how to make this work, I'd really appreciate the insight. If I did something wrong that would also be really good to know.\nI figured this might also be useful:\nmdadm --detail /dev/md0\n/dev/md0:\n        Version : 0.90\n  Creation Time : Thu Dec 10

Thank you!\n\nA: From the info you have provided I think you are likely correct in that the vast majority of your data remains intact.\nAt this point you are dealing with a broken RAID array. Obviously not where you want to be but not the end of the world either.\nIn my experience with ShareSpace units usually one drive will drop out of the array long before the RAID actually crashes.\nThe Linux Software RAID system detects the first drive failure and switches the array over to degraded mode.\nThis means the array continues to operate but it's only using the three remaining good drives.\nThings will appear to operate normally for a period of time until a second drive drops out of the array.\nThen the RAID crashes and you have a problem.\nThese drives drop out for a reason. Commonly it's bad sectors. Fortunately recovery is very often possible.\nBut you need to tread carefully as any miss-steps you take will lessen the chances of data recovery.\nIf you want to go it alone I would advise you to take backup images before proceeding further.\nI know easier said than done with four 2TB drives.

But I was really amazed when I installed it on my hp probook 4530s that has Windows 7 and I didn't see that error anymore.\nNote that this error didn't appear when I tried to install Ubuntu 12. 10 but I need to install Ubuntu 12. 04 for some reasons.\nAnother thing is that error shows up in installation and before partition choosing  list.\n\nA: I have a Windows 7 OP on the PC as well, so with that I could erase the Linux partition, then I restarted the ubuntu installation, and it worked. Windows was needed since virtual Ubuntu could not see the hard disks using 'fdisk'. So I recommend to start your PC with a live OP, then erase the linux partition.\n\nA: I think this is a bug, as similar behaviour is described on launchpad here: https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/ubiquity/+bug/945027\nFrom the bug description, looks like, problem is, when Ubuntu is installed on system, where are 2 OS and one of them is Ubuntu. Workaround could be to remove the old Ubuntu partition before you install a new one. \nThere are free partition managers, which can help you to do it.\n\nA: Make sure you are using the very latest 12.04 image (currently 12.04.4, released in February 2014). There was a bug in the ubiquity installer that shipped on earlier 12.04 releases, and which was only fixed in July 2013.\n", "Q: Storing files in the partition containing OS My hdd is partitioned into 220gigs n 250 gigs approx.Im able to store files on one of these partitions but I cant store any files on the other partition having the OS.The paste option never appears.I would like to use this space to store some files temporarily.Could you guys help me?If this question was asked previously Im extremely sorry.\nThanks in advance folks\n\nA: Sounds like a permissions issue. You can see the permissions of a directory by right clicking properties or in terminal.\nuser@computer / $ ls -al\ntotal 128\ndrwxr-xr-x  24 root root  4096 Mar 19 17:09 .\ndrwxr-xr-x  24 root root  4096 Mar 19 17:09 ..\ndrwxr-xr-x   2 root root  4096 Jan 15 17:27 bin\ndrwxr-xr-x   3 root root  4096 Mar 30 07:47 boot\ndrwxr-xr-x  17 root root  4300 Apr  3 22:24 dev\ndrwxr-xr-x 164 root root 12288 Apr  4 12:31 etc...\n\nIn the example above all the directories are owned by root. Chown the directory you would like to store the files in replacing  with your username\n$ sudo chown -R <your username> /path/to/dir\n\nThis will give you ownership of the directory so you can paste into it. The -R makes the change recursive so the ownership of sub directories are also changed.\n\nA: You could resize your home and root partition. The safest way would be to reinstall Ubuntu and set your root partition to something smaller. For most users 20Gb is plenty of space for a root partition. Leave your current home partition as is during the reinstall. Then you can expand your home partition into the newly freed up space.\nHere is a useful article on modifing partitions with GParted without losing data: http://www.howtoforge.com/partitioning_with_gparted\n", "Q: What does gnome-settings-daemon is not ready for configuration mean?

Executables made using graphics.h usually don't work in newer PCs (and laptops with Windows OS).\n(Although graphics.h has simple to use graphical functions, using it is no longer recommended/supported)\nAlso open source C++ compilers usually do not support conio.h.\nconio.h has most functionality in Borland compilers. It's also supported in MS VC++, but with less functionality. conio.h is not supported in gcc, etc.\n\nA: Embarcadero/Borland has Turbo C version 2 available for download on their website. Since it is a old compiler that runs under DOS you will need to install dosbox in order to use it.\nYou may wish to start using a modern graphics library such as SDL which will allow you to do graphics/mouse input in Ubuntu. \n", "Q: Is it possible to install Gimp on Ubuntu Server and use it in command line from a php script?

In Windows, I frequently will do things like copy a folder path from a save/open dialog and paste it into the address bar of Windows Explorer to browse the folder.  This seems to be even more needed in Ubuntu owing to the crippled file dialog (can't rename, move, delete, etc)   How can I do this in Ubuntu?\nSpecifically, how do I:\n\n\n*\n\n*Copy paths out of Save/Open dialogs\n\n*Paste paths into an 'Address Bar' so Nautilus can go right there\n\n\nA: Pasting paths into Nautilus' \"address\" bar\nYou can activate the \"location\" view with CTRL+L. To permanently show the path instead of \"breadcrumbs\" you will have to manually change a dconf key:\ngsettings set org.gnome.nautilus.preferences always-use-location-entry true\n\nTo revert the changes simply execute the following command:\ngsettings set org.gnome.nautilus.preferences always-use-location-entry false\n\n\nCopying file paths in the Save/Open dialog with Nautilus 3.4.2\nAs @AliNa pointed out, it used to be that you could access the location of a file or folder in the save/open dialog in the same manner as you can in a regular Nautilus window\nThis feature has been abolished in recent Nautilus releases as part of GNOME's design philosophy.\nHowever, you can still access the file and directory paths from the context menu:\n\nIt seems as though this method has been removed as well in more recent revisions of Nautilus (the ones that ship with Ubuntu >12.10)...\n\nSources:\nHow can I copy the current path from Nautilus?\nTyping location path instead of clicking directory buttons in the file picker dialog?\nHow do I change dconf keys without a gui (for a post-install script)?\n\nA: To paste a path into an 'address bar' without changing settings : Alt+F2 (run command) then type nautilus + paste the path.

This may be a simple question, but how do I use files starting with \"-\" with command line programs? \nFor example,  I am trying to use pdfgrep on a file named -2013-01-01.pdf but it complains that there are no options defined for 2, 0, 1, 3 and so on.\nChanging the filename to something that does not start with \"-\" solves it, but this is not an option since the files aren't created by me. I simply want to check for a specific change I know is coming.\n\nA: Very frequently -- is used on the command-line to signal to a program that no more available command switches are going to be used. This is particularly useful if a file contains a dash, which the program would try to interpret as an option.\n\n\n*\n\n*Without the --, there is an error generated:\n$ pdfgrep -i posix -find.pdf -xorg.pdf\n\npdfgrep: invalid option -- 'f'\npdfgrep: invalid option -- 'd'\npdfgrep: invalid option -- '.'\npdfgrep: invalid option -- 'p'\npdfgrep: invalid option -- 'd'\npdfgrep: invalid option -- 'f'\n\n\n*With the -- used we have a successful command:\n$ pdfgrep -i posix -- -find.pdf -xorg.pdf\n\n-find.pdf: on the command line. Currently-implemented types are emacs (this is the default), posix-awk,\n-find.pdf: posix-basic, posix-egrep and posix-extended.\n-find.pdf: posix-basic, posix-egrep and posix-extended.\n-find.pdf: posix-basic, posix-egrep and posix-extended.\n\n\n*pdfgrep is programmed to understand -- to mean that the following command-line arguments are not options. Most programs do the same, but not all programs understand --. For programs that don't, the solution is to prepend the filename with ./, like this:\n pdfgrep -i posix ./-find.pdf ./-xorg.pdf\n\nThis should work with any command, unless for some reason the command cannot accept a path, only a pure filename.\nFor a general introduction to the command-line, see this useful PDF.\n\nA: You prepend the file name with ./ (or another relative or absolute path that works).\nThis way it's portable. \nExample:\nfor zefile in ./*.tmp\ndo\n   rm -f \"$zefile\"\ndone\n\nThe use of -- to indicate the end of options is not always available. Some commands will know it, some won't. And this will change across different systems. So in the end, it's less portable.\n", "Q: How do I enable thumbnails for text files in nautilus?

As all the icons in question were all in a Ubuntu One synchronized folder, the live text preview (which works differently for text files and for other filetypes,  hence the inability of scripts to regenerate thumbnails to make thumbnails of text files) does not work because Ubuntu one uses emblems and they break the live text preview. \n\nA: To have an icon with a preview text for all the text files, follow this steps:\n\n\n*\n\n*Open the Preferences menu in the Edit tab\n\n*Click the Preview tab\n\n*Now you will see that the first option is \"Show text in icons\", choice it and select Always\nResult:\n\n", "Q: Keyboard starts skipping characters after wake from suspension/sleep, restart required.

That is to say that its root partition (/) is on /dev/sda1, and you don't have separate /boot, /home, or other partitions for that system.\nIt does use the swap partition from the old EasyPeasy system.\nTo get rid of the old EasyPeasy system:\n\n\n*\n\n*Make sure there really are no valuable data in it. If you're sure none of your documents or other important files remain there (without being offloaded elsewhere), proceed.\n\n*Make sure all your documents and important files in the [K]Ubuntu system are backed up. Besides that you should have a backup of all important files (that wouldn't be easily replaceable) anyway, dynamic partition resizing carries a risk of data loss. There are two reasons for this--problems sometimes occur and are occasionally not fully recoverable, and you might yourself make a mistake during the process.\n\n*Boot from an Ubuntu live CD/DVD or USB flash drive. If you don't have one; create one. (This is the same thing you used to install Ubuntu.) It is not safe to edit a physical disk's partition table from a utility running in an OS installation that resides on the same physical disk.\n\n*Select Try Ubuntu without installing (not Install Ubuntu).\n\n*When a usable desktop comes up, run the GParted Partition Editor. To do this, press the Super key (also called the Windows key) or click the \"dash home\" icon on the upper left of the screen. Startityping gparted into the text box. When you see GParted come up, click it.\nAlternatively, if this is a Kubuntu live environment, you'll find GParted in your menus, or you can use the Run... dialog box to run kdesudo gparted.\n\n*I will refer to /dev/sda5 and /dev/sda6 (as well as other partitions) in the following instructions. However, the following instructions are only correct as written if /dev/sda5 is much smaller than /dev/sda6. If /dev/sda5 is instead much larger than /dev/sda6, then assuming they are both still contained within the extended partition (see below), in that that situation (and that situation only) you should take every instance of /dev/sda5 to mean /dev/sda6 and every instance of /dev/sda6 to mean /dev/sda5.\n(Somewhat annoyingly, occasionally partitions are numbered differently from the perspective of different systems. I don't believe that's the case here, but if it is, I don't want to have you accidentally remove the swap partition. That would not cause data loss, but it would require extra work to be done to fix it.)\nBecause of that possible complication--but even without it, assuming you are not already familiar/comfortable with dynamic partition resizing (in which case you would probably not have asked how to do this)--I recommend reading these instructions all the way through before starting to follow them.\n\n*In GParted, you'll see the /dev/sda1 partition at the left side of the horizontal bar representing all the partitions on the drive. To the right of that you'll see an extended partition, which is a kind of container for other partitions. The extended partition here is called /dev/sda2. Inside the extended partition is your swap partition, /dev/sda5  (on the right side), and /dev/sda6 (to the left of it). Unless they are switched, as described above. /dev/sda6 is the only partition you want to delete--it is the partition for the old EasyPeasy system. It is much larger than /dev/sda5.\n\n*Delete /dev/sda6 in GParted. Now shrink /dev/sda2 (the extended partition container) by clicking Resize/Move and dragging its left side as far to the right as possible, so it's just big enough to contain /dev/sda5 (the swap partition). When you do this, the value of free space preceding will increase (and free space following will remain the same).\n\n*By removing /dev/sda6 (the partition for the old EasyPeasy system) and shrinking down /dev/sda2, you created free space to the right of /dev/sda1. You probably recall /dev/sda1 as the partition that stores all the files associated with your new [K]Ubuntu system.\nSo now, using Resize/Move on /dev/sda1, expand /dev/sda1 to the right, causing a decrease in free space following. Drag its right border as far to the right as you can, so that it is as close as possible to the left border of /dev/sda2,the extended partition. Don't worry if a small amount of unpartitioned space remains between them. (That is, drag it as far as you can, but it's fine if GParted will not let you expand it all the way.)\n\n*Apply your changes by clicking the green check mark in GParted.\n\n*If there were errors, you should be able to access the Internet from the live CD/DVD/USB system and provide information about them. (However, there will of course be no guarantee that I will be available to tend to them, or that I'll even be online at that time. Still, others can probably help too.)\nMost of the time, if there are errors, nothing is damaged. So if you need to use your installed system, feel free to do so.\n\n*Assuming no errors, reboot (properly, not by holding down your power button or unplugging your computer). Remove the live CD/DVD/USB so that you boot to your installed system. It should boot fine--the start of /dev/sda1 was not moved.\nIf it does not boot, then boot from the live CD/DVD/USB again and use any of the methods given here (or if you prefer, any of these) to reinstall GRUB to the Master Boot Record. That should let it boot again. The particular method I recommend in this situation (which I emphasize, I do not think will occur) is this one, because I can fill in all the details for you of what commands you need to run (based on the information you've provided about your partitions):\nsudo mount /dev/sda1 /mnt\nsudo grub-install --root-directory=/mnt /dev/sda\n\nSince you have no separate boot partition and your installed system's root partition is /dev/sda1, that's it. Then reboot, and your system should boot.\nAfter booting back into your Kubuntu/Ubuntu system, there are a couple of things you should check. (This is unrelated to and independent from whether or not you had to reinstall GRUB to the MBR as described above.)\n\n\n*\n\n*Check to make sure your / partition has really expanded. You can check this however you like; in Dolphin perhaps. Or run df -h and compare it with the output of df -h from before.\n\n*Check to make sure that the swap partition is still being used. Run:\nswapon -s\n\nIf you get something like what you got when you ran this before, great! If you get no output at all, that means swap is not in use. In that case, you'll have to check for what the swap partition is now numbered as (by running sudo parted -l or sudo fdisk -l) and then edit the swap line in /etc/fstab to provide that device name. I can provide additional assistance or more detailed instructions for that on request (or perhaps find another question where more detailed information is given).\nThe swap partition will probably continue to be used, though, because most partitions including linux-swap are identified in fstab files by their UUID's these days (which don't change unless the partition is actually deleted and re-created, or, in the far less likely scenario, if the UUID is deliberately changed). Therefore, even if the device name off the swap partition changed as a result of performing the operations detailed above, your swap partition will most likely continue being used automatically.\nIf you didn't have to reinstall GRUB to the MBR from the live CD/DVD/USB (which you probably didn't), then I recommend running this command from your installed Ubuntu system after verifying that everything is working properly:\nsudo update-grub\n\nThat's usually sufficient to remove any GRUB entries associated with the old operating system (that you've deleted).\nAnother Option is to Keep the Old Partition\nAccording to the output of df, only 2.8 GB of the 136 GB in your old EasyPeasy partition is used. The rest of this space is already available for you to use. If the partition is not mounted, you can mount it in the Devices list in Nautilus (but it was mounted when you ran df).\nIf you encounter permissions problems, you can simply change the ownership permissions in the partition wherever you want to create your own files. The most logical ways to do this would be:\n\n\n*\n\n*Create a folder in the root of the EasyPeasy partition, or\n\n*use your old EasyPeasy home folder.\n\n\nCreating a Folder in the Root of the EasyPeasy Partition\nThe EasyPeasy partition has no volume label (you can change this in Disks if you like). So it's mounted by its UUID. To go to its root directory in a Konsole, run:\ncd /media/5f92*\n\nYou can then create a folder for your files:\nsudo mkdir Storage\n\n(Call it whatever you like, it doesn't have to be Storage.)\nAnd give ownership of this folder to your user so you don't have to be root to use it:\nsudo chown $USER:$USER Storage\n\n(You can keep $USER as it is or replace it with your username; either way works. (Don't write $username where username is your username.)\nUsing Your Old EasyPeasy Home Folder\nYou might already have the full ability to read, create, and modify files everywhere inside your old EasyPeasy home folder. This will happen if the UIDs of your old EasyPeasy user and your current Kubuntu user happened to be the same.\nIf that's not the case, then in your old EasyPeasy home folder, you can run:\nsudo chown -R $USER:$USER .\n\nThe -R causes this operation to be performed recursively.\nRemoving the EasyPeasy System But Keeping Its Partition\n2.8 GB is an insignificant amount of space compared to the other ~133 GB that are already free in the old EasyPeasy partition. I did not interpret your question as being about freeing that space--I interpreted it as asking how to reclaim the rest for your Kubuntu partition.\nHowever, if you don't want to repartition, but would like to clear out the files from the old EasyPeasy partition, you can:\n\n\n*\n\n*Simply delete all the files in the old EasyPeasy partition, then run sudo update-grub. When GRUB is updated, it checks what operating systems exist. If an OS no longer exists on a partition, GRUB will generally not list it.\n\n*Format the the partition (you can do this in Disks), then run sudo update-grub.\nYour Ubuntu system uses KDE (Kubuntu) but you reported installing regular Ubuntu first and then installing KDE, so you should still have GNOME. Therefore, you should still have gnome-disk-utility (the package that provides Disks), or if you don't, you should be able to install it without pulling in too many dependencies that you already have.\nThen you'll have to create whatever ownership and permissions you want for the drive.\n\n*Use the OS-Uninstaller utility to automate formatting the partition and updating GRUB, so it's one step instead of two. For this, see LovinBuntu's answer.\nOnce you do that, you'll still have to create whatever ownership and permissions you want on the newly formatted drive.\nIf you keep the EasyPeasy system or even keep just its partition, the space in the EasyPeasy partition will not help you avoid running out of space from putting files in your home directory (of the [K]Ubuntu system), nor will it keep you from running out of space from installing lots of software. It will simply act like another drive you can use. (Like an external drive, except that since it's on the same physical disk as your installed system, it's not suitable for backups.)\nFrom a data storage perspective, keeping the old EasyPeasy system and using its partition is very similar to removing the old EasyPeasy system but keeping its partition and using it. However, if you're going to keep the partition, you may want to remove the system (in any of the three ways listed above) anyway, since it no longer serves any purpose, its folders could confuse you (as they're named the same as some of the folders in your new system), and updating GRUB after removing it will cause the EasyPeasy option to drop from the boot menu.\n\nA: To delete Ubuntu from your Kubuntu:\n\n\n*\n\n*Install OS-Uninstaller in your Kubuntu session\n\n*Run it, you will see a menu asking which OS you want to remove, similar to the one below:\n\n\n*Select Ubuntu (sda6), click the OK button.\n\n*Finished ! \n\n\nEDIT: At this point, your question is fully answered: your old OS will be deleted, its space will be freed and accessible from Kubuntu, so you can use it the way you want (you can put data in it, or install another OS in it, or else). Optionally, you can repartition your disk the way you want, but that's a risky operation, and as you did not ask it, I would not advise it.\n", "Q: kUbuntu 12.10 - Wireless problems with Centrino N-100 I installed kUbuntu 12.10 on my DELL XPS L501X laptop.

The output is: \nu1sdtool --cur\nCurrent uploads: 0\nCurrent downloads: 0\n\nThis text is grabbed in the TEXT part of my conkyrc config file as:\n${goto 55}${font Ubuntu:size=10,weight:normal}${color}U1 SYNC \n${goto 55}${font Ubuntu:size=10,weight:normal}${color1}${exec u1sdtool --cur }\n\nGiven that the text returned from u1sdtool --cur has two lines, the first line will be offset by 55 but the second will not. \nSee the bottom of the image. I would like to see the 'Current downloads' line be offset at 55 as well. Any idea how to do this?\n\nThis conky config file is my customized version of hardball's orange theme\nEdit: What I would like to have, ideally, is the correct alignment and, once I do have uploads, see a list of file names. \nSuch as eg.\nU1 SYNC \nCurrent uploads: 3\n  filename.txt \n  filename.jpg \n  filename.zip\nCurrent downloads: 0\n\n\nA: One solution is to split the output of u1sdtool --cur with grep:\nu1sdtool --cur | grep 'Current uploads:'\nu1sdtool --cur | grep 'Current downloads:'\n\nYour conkyrc would look like:\n${goto 55}${font Ubuntu:size=10,weight:normal}${color}U1 SYNC \n${goto 55}${font Ubuntu:size=10,weight:normal}${color1}${exec u1sdtool --cur | grep 'Current uploads:' }\n${goto 55}${font Ubuntu:size=10,weight:normal}${color1}${exec u1sdtool --cur | grep 'Current downloads:' }\n\nI will suggest to use execi instead to exec because exec is resource hungry. for more details:\nman conky\n\n", "Q: Text editor where unsaved files can be recovered after computer crash? I use Text Editor to draft emails and other messages.\nNot files that I want to save, just drafts.\nProblem: When my computer crashes (happens often recently), I loose the drafts.\nIs there a text editor that backs up unsaved files somewhere? (preferably in a single place)\nI tried Text Editor (Gedit), and Leafpad.\nNote: I don't want ~example files to be created everywhere, because they are a mess in the terminal, and can be dangerous when sharing USB sticks. So unfortunately I can't use GEdit's backup feature.\n\nA: Scribes is like Text Editor.\nBut it saves files automatically in your home folder, with a name like:\noqiowdq - (2013-04-05 16:49:15)\n\nWhere \"oqiowdq\" is the first line you typed.\nThis file is removed when you really save your file.\nUnfortunately, it does not have tabs, so feel free to post better answers.\nAlso, the line number on the left make the text less readable than Gedit.\n\nA: Besides Notepadqq, another alternative is Geany with Save Actions plugin.\nBoth of them support autosaving as well as backup. \nAnd both of them can restore the last session on startup.\n\nA: If you use gedit, you can turn on autosave in preferences -> editor and it saves documents with the period you specified. And about the autosaved documents place, if I'm right it saves any file in the same folder and same name with extra ~ at the beginning (it would be hidden so press ctrl+H to see it.)\n\nA: Vim (and by extension, GVim) has swapfiles, which are usually created in the same directory as the file, but can also be placed in a single common directory. Swapfiles are enabled by default, and for configuring the location, see :h 'directory:\n                                                'directory' 'dir'\n'directory' 'dir'       string  (default for Amiga: \".,t:\",\n                                 for MS-DOS and Win32: \".,$TEMP,c:\\tmp,c:\\temp\"\n                                 for Unix: \".,~/tmp,/var/tmp,/tmp\")\n                        global\n        List of directory names for the swap file, separated with commas.\n        - The swap file will be created in the first directory where this is\n          possible.\n        - Empty means that no swap file will be used (recovery is\n          impossible!).\n        - A directory \".\" means to put the swap file in the same directory as\n          the edited file.  On Unix, a dot is prepended to the file name, so\n          it doesn't show in a directory listing.  On MS-Windows the \"hidden\"\n          attribute is set and a dot prepended if possible.\n        - A directory starting with \"./\" (or \".\\\" for MS-DOS et al.) means to\n          put the swap file relative to where the edited file is.  The leading\n          \".\" is replaced with the path name of the edited file.\n        - For Unix and Win32, if a directory ends in two path separators \"//\"\n          or \"\\\\\", the swap file name will be built from the complete path to\n          the file with all path separators substituted to percent '%' signs.\n          This will ensure file name uniqueness in the preserve directory.\n\nSo, in your ~/.vimrc, add:\nset directory^=/path/to/swapfiles\n\nAnd make sure that /path/to/swapfiles exists.\n\nA: I assume you have given a name to your file or saved it before your system crashed, if not Gedit will automatically do that for you, provided that you have set up your editor to save you during these  times. Do this:\nOpen edit, select Edit -> Preferences -> Editor -> Create a Backup of file and Save file every 3 min. \n\nThis must solve any future problems like this.\n\nA: You can also use Notepadqq. It is like Notepad++ in MS Windows.\nhttp://notepadqq.altervista.org/wp/download/\n", "Q: Install Ubuntu on empty hard drive Can I install Ubuntu on an empty hard drive? Or do I need Windows installed to install it?\n\nA: Yes, you can.  You can install Ubuntu on a fresh drive, Along side Windows, and other ways.  Form DVD, and USB.  For information on how to install Ubuntu see Install Ubuntu\n\nA: Avoid installing Ubuntu on your external hard drive using a USB or DVD. If you install Ubuntu on your external hard drive while booting from USB or DVD, you will need to connect your external hard drive to your computer every time you want to use it.\nInstead use VMware Player to install Ubuntu on external hard drive.\n\nA: Yes you will be able to install on a blank hard drive.

After each reboot the value of the dconf entry is reset to the default value <primary><super><d>. \nI really don't know what to do now :P\n\nA: I can recreate your problem in 12.10 if I change the setting through System Settings >> Keyboard >> Shortcuts. \nThis is probably related to Bug #936840  about the change in Gnome from using <ctrl> to using <primary>. Note that the setting in System Settings is given as Ctrl+Super+D, so the setting is probably no longer going through correctly.\nWhen I left the setting in System Settings alone and made the change from CompizConfig or Dconf, the change held across reboots. Note that these two programs, use <Control><Primary><Super>d, so they apparently are able to hook the settings daemon correctly.\nIf you are still having trouble, try resetting System Settings to the default, rebooting, and then making the change from CompizConfig.\n", "Q: Pidgin status icon in 13.04 / Raring Ringtail I upgraded from Ubuntu 12.04 to 13.04. \nLooks great, but the Pidgin status icon does not appear in the upper right corner. \nHow can I fix this?\n\nA: Starting 13.04, applications will have to integrate into the indicators and can no longer have their own status icons in systray in Unity. (This may change in future.)\n\nThe Unity systray whitelist has been removed, so you can no longer whitelist applications to allow them to use the notification area in Ubuntu 13.04 Raring Ringtail. However, Java and Wine applications have been hard-coded as the only software still able to use the notification area so this change only affects some old applications that don't come with AppIndicator support. And since Qt applications systray icons are automatically converted to appindicators thanks to sni-qt, this change shouldn't affect too many applications.\n\nSource: http://www.webupd8.org/2013/04/ubuntu-1304-raring-ringtail-final-beta.html\n\nA: The functions of the former Pidgin icon are integrated into the messaging icon, which then will turn blue instead of white when new messages have arrived. But it is impossible to distinguish at a glance between new chat messages and new email (e.g. from Thunderbird, XChat, Empathy...).\nIf Pidgin does not work with the messaging icon in 13.04, this one from a similar question at \"Ubuntu 13.04 Pidgin Tray\" may hold the solution: Because when using the Pidgin icon with previous Ubuntu versions, you or someone else may have deactivated the libnotify plugin on purpose, which is needed for support of the messaging icon. If that is the case, this is the quick solution:\n\n\n*\n\n*Find the \"libnotify Popups\" plug-in in Pidgin (Tools menu)\n\n*activate it\n\n*configure what kind of popups you want to see (probably none)\n\n*restart Pidgin.\n\n\n(It is not necessary anymore to add a developer repository for Pidgin's libnotify plugin, as suggested in \"How do I enable the pidgin system tray icon?\" - that problem is fixed.)\nBut for everyone who still wants Pidgin to have its own original system tray icon, I do recommend the alternative repository for 13.04 of webupd8.org as suggested Peter Paldan in another answer on this page here. It will replace some binaries concerning the Gnome panel where the whitelist in dconf at com.canonical.Unity.Panel is still functioning as it should.\n\nA: There is \"HOW TO GET THE SYSTRAY WHITELIST BACK IN UBUNTU 13.04\" which look working so far for me:\nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:timekiller/unity-systrayfix\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get upgrade\n\nhttp://www.webupd8.org/2013/05/how-to-get-systray-whitelist-back-in.html\n", "Q: Configure GRE tunnel to start on reboot?

I am (re)installing Ubuntu 12.04 now, and I'd like to ask what things I have to install to properly run games with PlayOnLinux? I mean do I need to install some kind of graphics driver, or DirectX, .NET, etc? Does it come with Wine? How do I patch the games and how do I install the latest PunkBuster for example?\nThank you.\n\nA: PlayOnLinux allows you to easily install and use applications and games that run under Windows.  To install PlayOnLinux just type it in the search box at the Ubuntu Software Center, and click on install.  \n\nThe first time you run it, PlayOnLinux will download application updates it needs.  Once it’s finished updating, you can install a Windows application by clicking on install, and then by searching for the application, or by selecting the category on top or by choosing unlisted application. Click on the desired application, providing the you have the application to install.\n\n\n\nA: There is no need to install such things, just be sure that you have installed your graphic driver, playonlinux or wine include everything you need. Play onlinux has just some scripts to configure your games installation.\n", "Q: gksudo Nautilus only : \"Cannot load supported server method list.

This makes sense as GVFS needs a DBUS session context, so I'm happy this is expected behaviour on my system.  If I was seeing this same error when running Nautilus on a regular desktop login then I'd suspect a configuration problem, but it would still be worth looking at DBUS as a culprit.\nMaybe the developers could make that message more helpful!\n", "Q: How do I run Bioblender?

I feel that is possible but how?\nI have oracle open box VM in the server can this VM be used as a remote VM on the thin client?\nAfter a quick googling i found this thinclient which has an automated configurator for the thin client here. The least feature i want from this thin  system would be atleast a full blown libre office operation. \nUpdate:\nUsing vncserver on the lubuntu worked great for me. But still I have to install lubuntu to run vncserver, is it possible to run vncserver without an OS? or lightest OS possible?, the lubuntu itelf is an unneeded additional overhead?\n\nA: There are several ways you can do this. The problem with most solutions is that they assume only one user is using the computer, so when you are connected no one else can connect.\nX was supposed to do this very thing, as that is what it was designed for, but no one really used it remotely much because X used a lot of bandwidth, and during the peak of its popularity most people were using dial-up modems.\nEventually Ubuntu switched to away from X and lost the functionality to log into separate desktops remotely altogether. They replaced the X desktop with a window manager that uses Vino, a version of VNC, to remotely access your desktop. This means if you are connected no one else can use the computer, because Vino attaches to the root console and refuses to connect to any other user session.\nOracle VM has a built in remote desktop server that is independent of the operating system itself, but again the problem is that only one user can access it at a time.\nThe computing paradigm has moved away from multiple users using a computer at the same time because if five people could use the same computer at once you'd only buy one computer and Microsoft and hardware manufacturers would make 1/5th of the money.\nThe only way to achieve what you want to do with any reliability would be to install X and set up remote X sessions.\nThis article explains how to do so:\nhttp://www.tldp.org/HOWTO/Remote-X-Apps-9.html\n\nA: You haven't given the specs of your 'high end computer' nor whether you're interested in changing away from Oracle VM, so I'll throw out another idea in case it fits:\nVirtualBox (similar to VMWare) could let you re-purpose your high end computer as a host of a 'guest' virtual machine for your remote (thin) user.  Depending on its specs, the host might also support a (local) desktop user running on it, too.\nVirtualBox supports the (thin) client connecting to the guest's (virtual) desktop using a remote desktop app like MSTSC.EXE.  Note that you're not taking over the actual host server's desktop - that remains separate.  Folks might be able to comment below as to whether a host computer is usable as a desktop with an active guest virtual machine.\nLater on, if you wanted a second remote user, you could run up another virtual machine and connect to the server with a another (third) machine, also running a thin client remote desktop app.  Your 'high end computer' would need to be appropriately powerful to run all this though (1 local desktop plus 2 guest VMs).\nPS: some folks see VirtualBox and Oracle VM as similar - the former is an application you install using apt-get (similar to VMWare Player) while the latter is installed onto the 'bare metal' of your server (more similar to VMWare ESXi).\n", "Q: while installing phpmyadmin i am getting an error while installing phpmyadmin i am getting following error\nE: Sub-process gzip returned an error code (100)\n    E: Prior errors apply to /var/cache/apt/archives/php5-gd_5.4.6-1ubuntu1.2_amd64.deb\n\n\n\n   E: Prior errors apply to /var/cache/apt/archives/php5-mysql_5.4.6-1ubuntu1.2_amd64.deb\n    E: Prior errors apply to /var/cache/apt/archives/dbconfig-common_1.8.47+nmu1_all.deb\n    E: Prior errors apply to /var/cache/apt/archives/libmcrypt4_2.5.8-3.1_amd64.deb\n    E: Prior errors apply to /var/cache/apt/archives/php5-mcrypt_5.4.6-0ubuntu1_amd64.deb\n    E: Prior errors apply to /var/cache/apt/archives/phpmyadmin_4%3a3.4.11.1-1_all.deb\n    debconf: apt-extracttemplates failed: \n    dpkg: warning: 'sh' not found in PATH or not executable\n    dpkg: warning: 'rm' not found in PATH or not executable\n    dpkg: warning: 'tar' not found in PATH or not executable\n    dpkg: error: 3 expected programs not found in PATH or not executable\n    Note: root's PATH should usually contain /usr/local/sbin, /usr/sbin and /sbin\n    E: Sub-process /usr/bin/dpkg returned an error code (2)\n\n\nA: How are you trying to install it. Please specify that. By the way you can try LAMPP or XAMPP.\nTo install it very easily, you can try this:\n\n\n*Download this: http://www.apachefriends.org/en/xampp-linux.html#374 \n\n*Go to downloads folder through terminal, or where ever you downloaded it\n\n*Then become superuser through command:   su.

I'm planning to upgrade from Quantal ( 50 GB of /, 2 GB of swap and 250 GB of /home ) to Raring when it is released. Clean install, choosing Upgrade option only give me messy display. \nHow do I mount my existing 250 GB /home (not encrypted), when I install Raring as my new /home?\n\nA: First. Make backups of your /home. Then make copies of important documents in a flash drive (One can never be too careful).\nSecond, boot the computer from Live USB/DVD and start the install process.\nThe installer should see the existing Ubuntu 12.10 and give you an option to upgrade from  installation disk or some such thing (do not remember the exact words). This will preserve the /home partition and do a clean install. This will also try to reinstall some of the other packages you already have. Not all apps will get installed this way, as it depends on which repository they are from. Official Ubuntu repository based packages are most likely to get installed again. \nWhen it comes to naming the primary user and creating the user ID. Use exactly the same ID you had before. This will associate the user to its old /home/[user] folder. If you have other users for this machine, recreate the IDs after installation is complete and the first reboot.\nIf for some reason upgrade from installation disk does not work, choose Something Else... and select the / as the install location. The mount point should be /. Check the format partition option. Make sure /home partition is not checked for formatting. As before, choose your primary user ID as the one you had before.\nHope this helps\n\nA: You can install normally. After the install is complete, we need to know what partition is your home folder. Open the terminal and type $ lsblk. It will show your partitions. Look what of them corresponds to your home folder and note the name of the partition (sda1, sda2, etc)\nEdit your fstab by executing the following command:\n$ sudo gedit /etc/fstab\nThen add the following line to the end of the file\n/dev/sdaX  /home ext4  rw,noatime,nodiratime  0  2\nWhere sdaX is the name of the partition you noted. Also make sure your partition is ext4. If not you need to change the ext4 entry. Then restart your computer. Your home folder should be loaded now.\nNOTE: If you don't know about the terms I've used or you are beginner who doesn't like the terminal or editing text files, please go for the other answers. There are methods you may find easier. This is just the way I like to do.\n", "Q: libusb program not compiling I am trying to compile a program that uses libusb library in Ubuntu 12.04.\nI have installed the libusb-1.0-0-dev.

Please, somebody help me...\n\nA: Boot into your Ubuntu system, or if you cant boot with a LiveCD or LiveUSB.\nYou should install boot-repair in order to restore your GRUB settings easily.\nOpen a terminal and type:\nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:yannubuntu/boot-repair && sudo apt-get update\n\nThen press enter. \nAfter that type:\nsudo apt-get install -y boot-repair && (sudo boot-repair &)\n\nThen type\nboot-repair\n\nin the terminal to launch boot-repair.\nThen click recommended repair and do what it ask from you.\nSource: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Boot-Repair\n\nA: I wish you didn't delete your windows partition, but you can add windows 8 entry to grub in this way:\nto get your windows 8 UUID:\n1) sudo blkid\nadd windows 8 to grub\n2) sudo gedit /etc/grub.d/40_custom\n3) copy and paste these lines into the file [REPLACE UUID_FROM_WIN8 with what you got from number 1]\nmenuentry \"Windows 8 UEFI\" {\n     search --fs-uuid --no-floppy --set=root UUID_FROM_WIN8\n     chainloader (${root})/efi/Microsoft/Boot/bootmgfw.efi\n   }\n\nagain i wish you didn't delete your windows partition. confirm if solved.\n\nA: I'd try Rescatux instead of Boot Repair.  I believe Boot Repair is now only available as part of a specialized Ubuntu live DVD, a 900+ MB download, whereas Rescatux you just download the program .iso image, burn to CD, run on boot.  Much faster and easier to use.  It's never failed me.\nThen to set Windows as the default, boot into Ubuntu, then go to this page\nhttps://launchpad.net/~danielrichter2007/+archive/grub-customizer\nand follow the instructions to download and install grub-customizer.  Once installed, you can access it via the Settings Manager and set the computer to boot by default into Windows.\nYou might also try using testdisk (you can install it from the software center) to locate and restore the windows partition if you've deleted it.\nIf all else fails and your dad has to reinstall Windows, he can access the Windows partition by booting into the Ubuntu live DVD.  When the window asking if you want to try or install Ubuntu pops up, click Try, then you'll see the Windows partition near the bottom of the Unity bar showing up as a separate drive or volume - it'll have some strange gobbledygook name, more likely than not.  That way your dad can copy the files he needs (documents, photos, email, etc.) to a separate HD before doing the Windows reinstall.\n\nA: I found out how to make it work! I went to boot options just before ubuntu booted and selected UEFI OS. Now all I need to do is show the grub menu. I edited the grub file but I still can't see it.\n", "Q: How can I be sure that the updated packages are not compromised?

After every download the file will be checked for integrity by the GPG/PGP signature and thus you can be sure nobody has tampered with. In case that fails, you'll see the exact warning you got in the first place.\nA more thorough explanation, how to find and validate keys is described here: Ubuntu Community wiki: SecureApt\nUsing SSL won't make it more secure.

When I tried to boot, the installer told me there was a problem with my CPU.  I really want to run Ubuntu; is this a problem with my Ubuntu disc or with my laptop? Win7 currently runs fine, so I suspect that it is a hardware problem.\n\nA: The minimum requirements are:\n700 MHz processor (about Intel Celeron or better)\n512 MiB RAM (system memory)\n5 GB of hard-drive space\nVGA capable of 1024x768 screen resolution\nEither a CD/DVD drive or a USB port for the installer media\n\nIt should run on older computers.  More likely, the problem is that you burned a 64-bit disc and stuck it into a computer that does not have a 64-bit processor.  Try burning a 32-bit disc or USB drive and trying again.\n\nA: According to the QuantalQuetzal/ReleaseNotes\nSystem Requirements\nThe minimum memory requirement for Ubuntu 12.10 is 768 MB of memory and 5 GB of disk space for Ubuntu Desktop. Note that some of your system's memory may be unavailable due to being used by the graphics card. If your computer has only the minimum amount of memory, the installation process will take longer than normal; however, it will complete successfully, and the system will perform adequately once installed. \nYour system has only 512MB of RAM so it wont work.  However you should be able to use either Xubuntu or Lubuntu without any problems.\nXubuntu System Requirements\nMinimum system requirements for Xubuntu fall roughly between Ubuntu Server and Desktop:\n512 MB of system memory (RAM)\n5 GB of disk space\nGraphics card and monitor capable of 800*600 resolution  \n\nLubuntu System Requirements\nA Pentium II or Celeron system with 128 MB of RAM is probably a bottom-line configuration that may yield slow yet usable system with a standard lubuntu desktop.\nMake sure you get the 32-bit download.\nI would try them both without installing from a Live USB or CD/DVD, check everything works OK then install the one you prefer.

It worked, the installation process is finished.\nThe game doesn't run correctly.\nThe game reads my VRAM as 128 MB, mine is 512 MB. I think I must install the drivers or something so it reads it correctly?\nWhen I run the game it crashes with a weird error.\nEDIT: After installing wine 1.5.27 the game doesn't crash, instead it keeps loading, but nothing happens.\nI think the whole problem is with my graphics card, it's read as 128 MB instead of 512 MB.\nHow to install the proper graphics drivers?\n\nA: Instead of letting wine detect the amount of video card memory available, you can explicitly set it with winetricks. This can sometimes work, and is a possibility, as is investigating the other graphical tweaks available with winetricks.\nYou can run the following, for example, to set the videomemory to 512, rather than let wine try to detect the video memory available:\nwinetricks videomemorysize=512 \n\nIt is important to note that this will affect the default WINEPREFIX ($HOME/.wine) only. If you have other wineprefixes, you will have to specify your particular WINEPREFIX; for example: \nenv WINEPREFIX=$HOME/.otherprefix winetricks videomemorysize=512\n\nYou can also use the gui version of winetricks from the applications menu and select the wineprefix and then select change settings. Other options available for setting video memory are:\n\nThere is no way to tell whether these settings will work with your system, and you may have to tweak other settings such as shaders, etc. I should refer to the wine appdb page and the winetricks wiki and wine FAQ. You may have to investigate how wine and wined3d is detecting your video card and its capabilities. \nIt also might be worth reinstalling and using a fresh WINEPREFIX, as that can sometimes solve problems (see my answer here for how to do that), as well as using the current development version of wine from the official Ubuntu wine team ppa.\n", "Q: I have a IP adrs on my network defined as my DMZ server, but there is no server there, keep getting requests I have an IP address on my network which is defined as my DMZ server, but there is no server there. I keep getting connection requests to the DMZ server in my router logs. Is this good or bad?\n\nA: It's probably not bad.\nWhat the DMZ server is\nWhen you have a local network, your router uses NAT to enable communication between the computers on the local network, which each have local IP addresses, and the outside Internet, which sees your entire local network as only one IP address.\nThe NAT agent knows which of your computers to send incoming packets to only when a computer has already established an outgoing TCP connection to that address on that port, or has poked through with some outgoing UDP packets.\nFor any incoming traffic that it cannot match to an existing outgoing TCP connection or recent UDP communication, the NAT server normally discards it.  This has a side benefit of acting like a firewall.\nNow, NAT routers may have a DMZ feature.  This allows for all incoming packets from outside your network, that don't already match an open connection from another host, to be directed to that DMZ server, instead of discarding them as normal.  Essentially, the DMZ server becomes your local network's \"representative\" on the wider internet.  This can be good if you want to have an external-facing server which outside hosts can connect directly to.  However, this DMZ server will effectively not benefit from any of the security of NAT, and must be hardened against incoming network attacks (it should, for example, run its own firewall, as if it was a server on the internet).\nIn normal situations where you don't want to have a server exposed to the world, you shouldn't use the DMZ feature of your router.  You should leave it disabled.\nSome people advice to enable it, but point it to a non-existing IP address so packets never get returned.\nIMO this does not increase security, and just means that unwanted traffic takes up resources on your local network.  It also means that any computer that does, by chance, get mapped to the same address as the DMZ address, is left vulnerable to all the internet can throw at it.\nWhether it's normal to get unwanted incoming traffic\nAs for whether it's normal to get unwanted incoming traffic from the Internet?  Yes, it's normal (sadly).  Script kiddies, spam bots, or any random bots trying to find weaknesses, will create quite a bit of traffic, just hoping they'll randomly find a mail server that'll accept or relay their spam, or a vulnerable piece of server software.  The normal situation is for these to simply bounce off a firewall because they are unwanted and nothing is listening for them.  If you had DMZ off, that's what they'd do.  With DMZ on but mapped to a non-existent IP, they still don't go anywhere, as long as that IP address is unused, but the traffic does get processed at least by your local switch.\n", "Q: OpenVPN on Ubuntu OpenVZ I finished configuring OpenVPN on my OpenVZ vps.

I looked through all the config files I had to edit and made sure there was no reference to eth0 though. I configured it to this tutorial that I am finishing up (will be finished once I have the solution from here). \nPlease let me know how I need to change my configuration so that OpenVPN can start successfully.\n\nA: It turns out that you have to set up the tun/tap device on the openvz host.\nTo do this you need to make sure the host is running with lsmod | grep tun.\nIf nothing appears then run modprobe tun before running lsmod | grep tun to check it appears. Now that that is done you need to give the container access with the following commands (I suggest putting this in a script and then calling that):\nCTID=YOUR_CONTAINERS_ID_HERE\nvzctl set $CTID --devnodes net/tun:rw --save\nvzctl set $CTID --devices c:10:200:rw --save\nvzctl set $CTID --capability net_admin:on --save\nvzctl exec $CTID mkdir -p /dev/net\nvzctl exec $CTID mknod /dev/net/tun c 10 200\nvzctl exec $CTID chmod 600 /dev/net/tun\n\nI got a warning error message shown below, but restarting openVPN on the client now seemed to work.\n\nAlso, after having done this, I was able to connect successfully but couldn't connect to anything else.

It is not only affected by your system but also by the amount of resources you will make available for the VM. A VM will cut down your resources but how much you will need to find out the hard way. Then there is the game itself. Some games work very will with a VM others are impossible to play. In general it is best to stick with the main OS for games. Games are resource hungry anyways.\n2: So as explained with 1: My advice would be Windows with Ubuntu in VM. Games run better on the main OS. VM's will always cut into your resources. \n\nA possible setup for trial purposes would be to install an OS and then install both Windows and Ubuntu and try if you can find a sweet spot where games run as good as you want in either of the VMs or if the main OS still is the best option. \nThe best security is done with a router (if talking about people trying getting access to your machine) and not with your OS so what OS is main and what OS is in a VM does not really matter then. Secondly comes common sense: do not visit shady websites (when talking about virusses and malicious programs).\n\nDepending on the games you might also be able to use Ubuntu with wine. I play Guild Wars 2 using Ubuntu+wine. No guarantee all games work and most times it is a bit of work to get it working well but it might be an option.\nIn my own experience GW2 is about 10, 20% less good than when I play it on a Windows system. But this is not speed related but graphics related (graphics are a bit less).\n\nA: You can install Ubuntu using Virtualbox. It's a software used to emulate operating systems. With Virtualbox you'll be able to use Ubuntu (and other operating systems) without restarting your computer. You can download it here https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads\nIf you really like Ubuntu I suggest you to install it along side with Windows (dual boot). This way you'll have the best experience with Ubuntu. Virtualbox is nice but it's a little limited.

I have a macbook with ubuntu quantal running on it and I also have a device with a linux distro (FYI, a raspberry pi*).\nI've been trying to set up the device to share my laptop's wireless connection through the ethernet port.

The host will use DNS to resolve the IP, and then sent a datagram which includes the URL. This is why you can have different rules for different directories when you play with proxies (or even multiple website domains on a single IP).\nBut as written before. HTTP is the odd duck here. And first it will need to resolve the IP via DNS.\nI pondered posting this as a comment since it does not really help you with the problem, other then understanding where things go wrong.

I want to install Ubuntu onto a USB stick. When I downloaded Ubuntu onto my USB stick, it won't start up.\nDo I first have to download Ubuntu onto my chromebook hard drive, open Ubuntu and then make USB stick bootable? And then return back to chrome?\nOr is there a way to download directly onto USB and make the stick bootable?\nI appreciate any help.\n\nA: You can install any iso file on a USB using Chromebook/ChromeOS.\nThere's an app called Chromebook Recovery Utility, which it's main purpose is to create a recovery of your chromebook on a USB.\nBut, it has the Use local image option that can install any iso file on a USB drive. See screencap below.\n* In order for the iso to appear in the listed of available images, you'll need to rename the iso file to have the extension .bin.\n\n\nA: How did you make the USB stick? Did you use UNetBootin? There's supposed to be something you can do with fdisk, but I'm too lazy to talk about that right now. (Don't worry, there's like a 90% chance someone else will add an answer detailing that method.)\nI'd recommend this alternative method - it's a little more \"hacker-ish\" (you're basically tricking your computer into thinking the USB stick is a CD-ROM,) but it's the simplest method ever to make your bootable USB drive.\nOkay, first off, we're going to enter Crosh - ChrOme SHell is what I think it stands for. Anyway, it's basically useless, except to open up the \"real\" Shell.\nPress CTRL-ALT-T to open it up, then type shell and press Enter. You'll now be presented with a $ with (maybe) some text before it. If you see this, congrats. You're in. If not, reread the instructions and try again.\nOnce you've gotten the Shell open, type cd Downloads (assuming you saved the ISO to your Downloads folder.)\nNow, we need to figure out what Device your USB stick is. It's usually /dev/sdb, if it's your computer's only USB stick plugged in, but it you're nervous, type fdisk -l - it'll reply with a bunch of tech stuff. Upload it to Pastebin, then post the link as a comment below my post.\n(NOTE: THE FOLLOWING COMMAND WILL WIPE ANYTHING CURRENTLY ON THE USB DRIVE. IF YOU HAVE ANYTHING VALUABLE ON IT, PLEASE REMOVE IT BEFORE CONTINUING.)\nOnce you've figure out what your USB drive is, type:\ndd if=ubuntu-12.*-desktop*.iso of=/dev/sdb\n\n(except, edit the *'s to complete the filename.)\nThis will \"burn\" the Ubuntu disk image to your USB stick, as if it were a CD. In fact, it basically turns the USB stick into a CD, albeit one that runs significantly faster than your average optical drive.\nWhen it's finished, reboot your computer and spam F12 while it's booting up - it should ask you what you want to boot from. Choose USB CD-ROM or something similar. Ta-da, you have just booted from the USB stick! If that didn't work, reboot and try a different F# key or perhaps a different boot device. There's not really much to screw up here, unless you enter the BIOS settings and break something (but that's highly unlikely. ;)\nJust remember that after you have done this to the USB stick, you can't use it as a USB stick until you reformat it. Normal Windows utilities can't do this, use something like Gparted instead. Create a new partition table (if it asks, use msdos,) and then create a new partition with the Type as FAT32.\n\nA: I had issues simply changing *.iso to *.bin--the Recovery Utility seemed to work, but the resulting USB wasn't always bootable.\nFortunately there is an easy fix:\n\n*\n\n*Right-click on the *.iso image you want to write\n\n\n*Choose the \"Zip selection\" option from the menu\nthis will just create a *.zip file of the *.iso image and should only take a couple minutes.

(You can't ssh directly to the second one unless you're on the campus network.)\nHow can I make it so that I can just type a simple one-line command and get right into the private server? I'm not worried about security here at all, I'd really like to just skip having to type a password altogether.\n\nA: SSH allows you to specify a command to be run on the remote host in place of a login shell. Therefore, you can write an SSH command that chains together two instances, like so:\nssh user@public.school.com -t -t ssh user@private.school.com\n\nOf course, you can leave out usernames if they're the same.\nObviously, this is a hassle to type, so you can set a bash alias by putting the following line in your ~/.bash_profile file (you will need to create it if it does not already exist):\nalias school_ssh='ssh user@public.school.com -t -t ssh user@private.school.com'\n\nI don't think you can specify a password. However, if you can, you could generate an SSH key pair. On your local computer, put the private key, and put the public key on the public school network. Then ssh into the public network and generate a second keypair. Leave the second private key on the public network, and put the second public key on the private network.\nSSH keys will ask you for a passphrase. You can specify none, by simply not typing anything at the generation prompt and hitting enter, but I would recommend against this. This is because SSH passphrases are less painful than just a regular password: when a program running in an xterm asks to use an SSH key, Ubuntu will pop up a graphical password box instead of asking you in the terminal. You then have the option to keep the SSH key unlocked for the rest of the session. You can also set Ubuntu to automatically unlock the key at login.\n", "Q: Can someone recommend a capture card that will work with Ubuntu 64bit, XBMC, that I can buy in the US I am wanting to add a tv capture card that records over the air antenna channels in the US that will work with Ubuntu 64 bit and XBMC?\nI would like add it to my XBMC system that I have hooked up to my tv so that I can record tv shows and such.\nI have looked at other post and can't seem to find the correct info on the hardware to use and a place to get it.

When we are using windows ping , it will show the failed pings. Does Ubuntu have similar function?\nThe failed ping is quite useful when debugging the network. How you guys solve this? Well, I only want simple solution, I don't want to get a long script.\n\nA: When Windows' ping says \"Request timed out.\", it is not an error per se. Microsoft arbitrarily chose a timeout of 4 seconds, after which they assume \"failure\" and report it. If you were to ping anything from Mars, that's a guaranteed false alarm, but even on Earth RTT (round-trip time) over 4s is perfectly possible. The timeout is configurable with a /w <millisec> switch.\nOn Linux, ping utility does not assume that timeout is a failure and doesn't wait for reply. Normally, it prints all received replies immediately and as-is, including \"late\" ones, out-of-order ones, duplicates and and conflicting responses (e.g. a valid reply after \"Destination unreachable\").\nHaving said that, there usually are options to see when a reply isn't received for too long. Even on my Android phone, stock ping utility supports these 2 options:\n\n*\n\n*-D prints a timestamp before every message, makes gaps easier to spot.\n\n*-O prints a message when reply is not received before sending next ping, and this is more or less what was asked. The \"timeout\" is fixed to ping interval (-i), though.\n\nHowever, these options do not seem to be supported everywhere (e.g. Debian Wheezy lacks them as far as I know, while Jessie has them. busybox ping does not support them yet).\nHere is an example output I managed to get (unimportant ping replies skipped):\nu0_a93@NX505J:/ $ ping -D -O 8.8.8.8\nPING 8.8.8.8 (8.8.8.8) 56(84) bytes of data.\n[1440545014.805478] 64 bytes from 8.8.8.8: icmp_seq=1 ttl=244 time=116 ms\n~~~~~~~~~~\n[1440545142.995443] 64 bytes from 8.8.8.8: icmp_seq=129 ttl=244 time=110 ms\n[1440545144.885601] no answer yet for icmp_seq=130\n[1440545145.455485] 64 bytes from 8.8.8.8: icmp_seq=131 ttl=244 time=568 ms\n[1440545145.455780] 64 bytes from 8.8.8.8: icmp_seq=130 ttl=244 time=1569 ms\n[1440545146.005850] 64 bytes from 8.8.8.8: icmp_seq=132 ttl=244 time=119 ms\n~~~~~~~~~~\n[1440545254.055962] 64 bytes from 8.8.8.8: icmp_seq=240 ttl=244 time=115 ms\n^C\n--- 8.8.8.8 ping statistics ---\n240 packets transmitted, 240 received, 0% packet loss, time 239250ms\nrtt min/avg/max/mdev = 109.062/138.757/1569.620/101.608 ms, pipe 2\n\nNote how #130 is first reported \"missing\", then received after #131, and finally packet loss is reported to be zero. Windows' ping would never give such a result: it waits until a reply or a timeout and only then sends next ping, ignoring any late or non-first replies.\n\nA: Maybe ping -f is suitable for you. From ping manual:  \n\n-f\nFlood ping. For every ECHO_REQUEST sent a period ''.'' is printed,\n  while for ever ECHO_REPLY received a backspace is printed. This\n  provides a rapid display of how many packets are being dropped. If\n  interval is not given, it sets interval to zero and outputs packets as\n  fast as they come back or one hundred times per second, whichever is\n  more. Only the super-user may use this option with zero interval.\n\nFor 1 echo_request every second it would look like ping -i 1 -f 8.8.8.8\n\nA: Going partially off the answer by EvgEnZh, but with my own version:\nping -O -q 8.8.8.8\n\nThat makes it print a message when a reply takes too long or never comes back (-O) and suppresses messages for when they do come back (-q). The result is that you only get output when packets go missing. This can make finding intermittent problems much easier by making it so you don't have to sift through a pile of \"it worked\" messages for the few places it broke.\n\nA: \nthere is no such thing as \"failed lost ping\". (Failure replies like \"Destination unreachable\" are always printed, it is different from no reply at all.)\nPing utility prints every received reply, even if it eatlier decided that this specific ping was lost. It is entirely possible to receive replies out of order.\n\"\n\nThis is apparently no longer the case. Just a year after you posted this, iputils/ping broke so now it is entirely possible that nothing gets printed.\nhttps://github.com/iputils/iputils/issues/320\n\nA: Even with the -v option, ping don't do that. See this question. But if this is really important (or fun) for you, you can download the source, modify the code to include a suitable printf call.

I installed lubuntu 12.04 so that I can learn, but I mistakenly installed it on a partition that contains 90 gigabytes of data.  However, my data wasn't deleted: I knew that when I wanted to install Windows that my data is still there, by knowing the used space of the HDD.\nNow the problem is: I can't find my data on Linux in the same partition, neither can I find the whole partition in Windows. I think it's hidden, so how can I show it?\nIf it isn't hidden how can I find it?? The data was in the form of multiple files and various kinds (video,docs,music..etc).\n\nA: Your question is very ambiguous, how do you know it isn't deleted if you can't find it?\nIf you are trying to work out where your hard drive space has been taken up you can use a tool called baobab. It can be installed using sudo apt-get install baobab (if it is not already installed).\nThere is also a chance if you think you installed it on a partition with data, that it may have been completely wiped if you cannot find the data anywhere.\n", "Q: dell inspiron n4010 wi fi not connected I'm using dell n4010 lapt0p and i installed ubuntu 10.04 desktop edition but i'm unable to connect with wireless network?\nmy lspci output is \n    00:00.0 Host bridge: Intel Corporation Core Processor DRAM Controller (rev 18)\n00:02.0 VGA compatible controller: Intel Corporation Core Processor Integrated Graphics Controller (rev 18)\n00:16.0 Communication controller: Intel Corporation 5 Series/3400 Series Chipset HECI Controller (rev 06)\n00:1a.0 USB Controller: Intel Corporation 5 Series/3400 Series Chipset USB2 Enhanced Host Controller (rev 06)\n00:1b.0 Audio device: Intel Corporation 5 Series/3400 Series Chipset High Definition Audio (rev 06)\n00:1c.0 PCI bridge: Intel Corporation 5 Series/3400 Series Chipset PCI Express Root Port 1 (rev 06)\n00:1c.1 PCI bridge: Intel Corporation 5 Series/3400 Series Chipset PCI Express Root Port 2 (rev 06)\n00:1c.5 PCI bridge: Intel Corporation 5 Series/3400 Series Chipset PCI Express Root Port 6 (rev 06)\n00:1d.0 USB Controller: Intel Corporation 5 Series/3400 Series Chipset USB2 Enhanced Host Controller (rev 06)\n00:1e.0 PCI bridge: Intel Corporation 82801 Mobile PCI Bridge (rev a6)\n00:1f.0 ISA bridge: Intel Corporation Mobile 5 Series Chipset LPC Interface Controller (rev 06)\n00:1f.2 SATA controller: Intel Corporation 5 Series/3400 Series Chipset 6 port SATA AHCI Controller (rev 06)\n00:1f.3 SMBus: Intel Corporation 5 Series/3400 Series Chipset SMBus Controller (rev 06)\n00:1f.6 Signal processing controller: Intel Corporation 5 Series/3400 Series Chipset Thermal Subsystem (rev 06)\n03:00.0 Network controller: Broadcom Corporation Device 4727 (rev 01)\n04:00.0 Ethernet controller: Atheros Communications AR8152 v1.1 Fast Ethernet (rev c1)\nff:00.0 Host bridge: Intel Corporation Core Processor QuickPath Architecture Generic Non-core Registers (rev 05)\nff:00.1 Host bridge: Intel Corporation Core Processor QuickPath Architecture System Address Decoder (rev 05)\nff:02.0 Host bridge: Intel Corporation Core Processor QPI Link 0 (rev 05)\nff:02.1 Host bridge: Intel Corporation Core Processor QPI Physical 0 (rev 05)\nff:02.2 Host bridge: Intel Corporation Core Processor Reserved (rev 05)\nff:02.3 Host bridge: Intel Corporation Core Processor Reserved (rev 05)\n\nand my iwconfig output is:\niwconfig\nlo        no wireless extensions.\n\neth0      no wireless extensions.\n\npan0      no wireless extensions.\n\nmy rfkill output is \nrfkill list all\n0: dell-wifi: Wireless LAN\n    Soft blocked: no\n    Hard blocked: no\n1: dell-bluetooth: Bluetooth\n    Soft blocked: no\n    Hard blocked: no\n2: hci0: Bluetooth\n    Soft blocked: no\n    Hard blocked: no\n\nand my  lspci -nn -d 14e4:\noutput is:\n03:00.0 Network controller [0280]: Broadcom Corporation Device [14e4:4727] (rev 01)\n\nnow what am i do please help me?\n\nA: Please get a temporary wired ethernet connection, open a terminal and do:\nsudo apt-get install linux-headers-generic\nsudo apt-get install bcmwl-kernel-source\nsudo modprobe wl\n\nYour wireless should now be working.\n", "Q: How to set kmix default volumes?

Not with 4 GB.\n\n\nReasons to use 64 bits:\n\n\n*\n\n*There is no more 32 bit (4 GB address space limit, thus you can use more then 4 GB physical RAM without trickery (PEA).\n\n*There is no more 32 bit virtual address space. (Not just used for programs, but also for mapping files, or mapping a videocards memory into normal address space. (\ntry mapping a modern 6 GB videocard into 32 bit address space.)\n\n\nBoth of these will come in very handy if you later decide to expand your system without doing a complete reinstalation.\nAs to the memory advantage for 32 bit. Yes. 64 bits programs are slightly faster. 64 bit mode also unlocks additional CPU capabilities. Both roughly cancel each others advantages resulting in an equally fast system.\n\n*1 Ancient.

It's easily available (just install that package and boot to it) and recieves updates. It's built around the generic kernel with configuration tuned to lower latency. This is a soft-real-time kernel.\nGiven things are going through abstration layers for virtualisation, it's unlikely that the whole stack will be realtime anyway so personally I'd say soft-rt is fine.\n\nIf you want to pursue a true realtime system, you're going to have to build your own kernel.

I just want ubuntu to remember my password after I login as an admin user and use that when installing/removing software or running sudo commands. The non-admin users should be prompt for the admin password though. Is there a way to do that and if so why doesn't ubuntu do that as default?\n\nA: There's no such thing as \"an admin password\" in Ubuntu. Any user can elevate his privileges by using sudo as long as that is available to him. And by default sudo requires you to re-authenticate for security reasons. This is a sane default for this reasons as it fits with the \"secure by default\" policy.\nHowever, it does remember it for a short period of time. Here's a question on how: How does sudo remember you already entered root's password?\nSeveral options to go from here:\n\n\n*\n\n*Passwordless sudo\nFrom the manpage of sudoers(5):\n\nBy default, sudo requires that a user authenticate him or herself before running a command. This behavior can be modified via the NOPASSWD tag.\n\nJust change the lines in /etc/sudoers to include this. E.g.:\n%admin  ALL=(ALL) ALL\n%sudo   ALL=(ALL:ALL) ALL\n\nbecomes\n%admin  ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD: ALL\n%sudo   ALL=(ALL:ALL) NOPASSWD: ALL\n\n\n*Extend timeout\nBy default sudo will \"remember\" your password to elevate your privileges again for fifteen minutes. You can extend this to a much longer time, let's say a day. Do note that this is not unlocked on login, but only triggered the first time you are elevating your privileges.\nTo extend this, edit the /etc/sudoers file and locate the line\nDefaults        env_reset\n\nand append ,timestamp_timeout=1440 to it so it becomes\nDefaults        env_reset,timestamp_timeout=1440\n\nAlternatively, use -1 (a negative value) to have a really indefinite timeout. Read more about this on the Ubuntu Community wiki: RootSudoTimeout.\nImportant note! Editing the /etc/sudoers file should be done with great care. Incorrect syntax will result in a system on which you are probably not be able to elevate your privileges again and you'll have to perform a rather complicated password recovery. To edit it safely, use the sudo visudo command in the terminal. It will not directly write to the file, but only when you exit and save it and the syntax is correct. This will prevent a lot of trouble.\n\nA: In your system settings - little gear icon in right top corner - you can open Users.\nClick on the user you want to modify for the passwordless login.\nIn the settings dialogue you can change the setting automatic login.\n", "Q: USB Keyboard and Mouse no longer work after GRUB boot My USB keyboard and mouse don't work when booting into Ubuntu 12.04.\nThe keyboard is fine up until the boot loader (GRUB).

Maybe I can get you started. Ubuntu 12.10 picked up an upstream change that automounts media in a directory that changes by user ID. (Justification for the change can be found at freedesktop.org.) You want a static location shared by all users.\nThe quick and dirty fix is to symlink all your users' mount points back up to the shared directory, something like sudo ln -s /media/$USER/* /media/. See How to configure the default automount location? Note a comment by rocko in that reference claiming a better, general solution is coming in Ubuntu 13.04.\nIn 12.10 a solution better than the symlink hack is to arrange a static mount point in /etc/fstab. In my case, I have a USB CDROM drive, and this works as far as I've tested it:\n\n\n*\n\n*Find the symlink for the CDROM device in udev rules:\ncat /etc/udev/rules.d/70-persistent-cd.rule\nin my case, there was a series of entries for my PLDS_DVD device including one with SYMLINK+=\"cdrom\", meaning the device shows up at /dev/cdrom.\n\n*Create a suitable static mount point:\nsudo mkdir -p /mnt/cdrom\n\n*Link these things together in /etc/fstab with a line like this:\n/dev/cdrom /mnt/cdrom iso9660 ro,user,noauto,unhide\n\n*Create a Samba share using path=/mnt/cdrom (you know how to do this already)\n\n\nI'm just piecing things together here, and honestly I haven't tested this whole series in exactly this way, but you should be able to share the CD after some user, any user, manually mounts: mount /mnt/cdrom.\n\nA: http://aarklonlinuxinfo.blogspot.nl/2011/01/cd-rom-sharing-via-samba.html\nIf you change the cd(in the share), then on the other pc you need to unmount, and mount de share again, then you see the new cd.\nIn ubuntu with gigolo it is easy.\n", "Q: Problem downloading or installing anything from Software Center I've been trying for days now to install Eclipse on Ubuntu 10.10 but it never works. if I double click on Eclipse icon, it does nothing.

When installing Ubuntu, is there a way you can choose which part of the disk you want your partition to be on? I am partitioning a 2TB HDD, giving 300GB to Ubuntu, however I don't want this partition in the middle of the HDD, as it is used as my storage drive for Windows.\n\nA: While running the ubuntu installer, you are given two options:\n\n\n*\n\n*Use entire harddisk\n\n*Manually configure partition table\n\n\nSelect the second option and layout the disk as you like. This works best if the disk is empty. Otherwise you could destroy existing files/partitions if it's not done correctly.\neg first partition 'ext4'(300gb), second partition 'linux swap'(4-12gb), third partition 'ntfs'(rest)\n", "Q: Booting does not work I recently had my ubuntu installed and I'm still learning the software.

The only way to debug is to mess with the system settings and change the ptrace variable configuration but I'm not comfortable with this, as it compromises security.\nSo my question is, is there anything close to Qt Creator or Visual Studio debugger in Linux? I mean being able to track variable values and pointers, etc.\nIf not what's the standard debugger for Linux? I don't mind using console tools as long as they offer the same functionality\n\nA: Have you looked at gdb? It's a command line interface tool. \nAnother option is to go with Eclipse C/C++, which is a full fledged C and C++ IDE that provides front-end for gdb (CDT GNU Toolchain Debug). \nI have not used the latter as am pretty comfortable with gdb.\n\nA: Without ptrace, I can't think of a debugger that will work.  This other question has an answer that describes how to temporarily disable the ptrace restriction.  It's not a gaping security problem to disable it temporarily for debugging.  Generally, however, users don't need that functionality and there's no reason to allow it without reason.  \nSaying having ptrace enabled at all ever is a problem is a lot like saying plugging in an Ethernet cable is a problem.  While it can be construed as correct, debugging without debugging permissions is not possible.  \n\nA: I can recommend gdb (it comes in package with GCC/g++ compiler suite I think - also you can use Qt Creator in Ubuntu). I have used it with and without ptrace and I don't really spot the difference, to be honest.  But that's just maybe the way  am developing. Also worth mentioning is Intel compiler: free for non-commercial use, and it has debugger integrated with Eclipse. However, it also requires to disable ptrace.\n", "Q: Ubuntu 11.04 not booting up I try to boot up and get the following text on screen:\nThe PostgreSQL server failed to start.

I have been successfully using a Logitech cam with no issues at all, but my Lifecam's video quality is much better. \nAny help is much appreciated...\n\nA: This might be the reason of the issue you're experiencing:\nDespite being able to work with lower USB bandwidths, this device always requests the maximum possible bandwidth, even for the MJPEG format. Using one of those cameras in conjunction with another USB device (including the camera internal microphone) will likely fail. You can tell the uvcvideo driver to estimate the required bandwidth instead of trusting the camera by setting the FIX_BANDWIDTH quirk. This will only affect uncompressed formats, and even there there's no guarantee of success. See the FAQ for more information.\n", "Q: How to export saved FTP password from GNOME Commander?

However, when I switch to a tty (Ctrl+Alt+F1-through-F6), the screen seems to completely turn off (not even the backlight stays on). I can return to the graphical mode, but the area where the dock usually resides shows random gibberish until I reveal the dock (I have it set to auto-hide).\nI am using the nvidia proprietary drivers, with the Intel HD integrated GPU disabled and it's kernel module blacklisted (this machine has hybrid graphics).\nWhen I use Ubuntu's recovery mode, I can see the text-only interface. If I select FailsafeX, then switching to a tty once I see the limited graphics mode dialogue pop up doesn't work.\nI have tried the answer from: \"Why does switching to the tty give me a blank screen?\", and tried booting with nomodeset, but the issue remains.\n\nA: I'm having the exact same problem on a brand new Lenovo IdeaPad Y500.\nThe best lead I have so far is that the parameter \"UseVbios\" in nvidia's driver settings needs to be set to 0.\nThere are several theoretical ways to accomplish this, none of which work for me.\nSo far, I have:\n\n\n*\n\n*added a \"nvidia.NVreg_UseVBios=0\" in /etc/default/grub in the GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT parameter (and ran sudo update-grub afteward )\n\n*added a nvidia.conf file under /etc/modprobe.d/ containing the single line options nvidia NVreg_UseVBios=0\n\n*added an Option \"RegistryDwords\" \"UseVBios=0\" line to /etc/X11/xorg.conf under the nvidia Device section.\n\n\nNeither of those appear to work for me. Most of the posts about it refer to UseVbios being one of the lines in the output of cat /proc/driver/nvidia/registry , but with my nvidia driver ( nvidia-current, 304.43), it's actually showing in /proc/driver/nvidia/params.\nSo I'm still hunting around for the proper voodoo to change that.\nIn the meanwhile, while I'm not quite ready to have my dog chew on my laptop, I can certainly relate to the sentiments expressed here.\n*edit1: The first two methods can be made to work by using \"nvidia_current\" as the module name rather than nvidia. Interestingly, having UseVbios set to 0 isn't sufficient to fix this. Onward.\n", "Q: Can connect to wireless.

I just changed from Linux Mint to Ubuntu. Looking on my routers setting it showed my computer up as connected, but next time I looked it didn't.\n\nA: Does your wireless internet work on any other device (computer, phone)? If it does, it is probably a problem with your computer, which I  cannot help you with. However if your wireless internet doesn't work on any other devices, read on.\nIf you can connect to the network but not to the internet it is usually a problem with your router, modem or the cables running between. \nFirstly you should make sure that the internet cable going into your modem is in securely, then you should make sure that the internet cable going out of your modem and into the router is in securely on both sides. If you have done that and you can still not connect to the internet you should go to your router and unplug the internet cable going into it and plug it in directly into your computer's Ethernet port. If you can get internet then, your router is not setup properly or your router is in need of a replacement. If you still can't get internet you probably have a bad cable. \nGood luck on debugging the internet. =)\n", "Q: How can I create an activity indicator in Ubuntu Touch?

Zoom in on the Flash applet (or game, or whatever) and you're away!\n\nA: There is a better solution. \nIf you are in it for the kicks. Is to configure your machine to use Two X server simultaneously. This will allow you to keep focus on one screen.

I have an older machine onto which I'd like to install XUbuntu 12.04 32bit desktop.  I have prepared the CD, and can boot from it, but the graphical installer is slow to the point of uselessness while running from CD.  I do want to install xfce, I just want to avoid the graphical installer.  \nWifi coverage appears to be poor in this location and moving the machine is impractical, so I'd like to install as much as possible from CD and get a desktop up and running, see if it will be usable when running from HD, test wifi, and iron out connectivity later, which rules out the network install suggested in this answer\nIs there a way to boot from the Xubuntu CD but bypass the graphical installer?  If not, is there a way to improve performance of the CD installer, perhaps by creating a tmp swap partition on an HD, or by copying the CD to an HD to run from there?  The target machine has two smallish (60-80GB) HDDs with no data to be retained; I can repartition as needed.\n\nA: The desktop CD doesn't come set up to use the text-based installer. The text-based installer is provided by the debian-installer package, but installing or adding that package to a desktop CD will not make it possible to install that way without substantial additional modifications.\nThis is because the graphical installer (Ubiquity) works primarily by copying the contents of the live CD's own squashfs image to disk, while the text-based installer works by chrooting into a bootstrapped minimal system and installing each package. These are fundamentally different approaches to designing an OS installer. (The \"graphical\" way requires a big squashfs image that takes up most of the CD. The \"text-based\" way requires lots of individual .deb package files that take up most of the CD.)\nTherefore, you should use the Xubuntu 12.04 Alternate CD instead. This provides the text-based installer you want. 12.04 is the last version of Ubuntu (and its derivatives, like Xubuntu) to have an Alternate CD, so you wouldn't be able to install a later version from an Alternate CD. But this will work for 12.04 and earlier.\nThe current point release for 12.04 is 12.04.2; you should use that to install, or you'll install a very large number of old packages that will immediately need updating.\nISO images for Xubuntu 12.04.2 are located in:\n\n\n*\n\n*http://cdimage.ubuntu.com/xubuntu/releases/12.04.2/release/\nFor your convenience, here are some links:\n\n\n*\n\n*32-bit alternate CD (torrent) | 64-bit alternate CD (torrent)\n\n\nIf you prefer, these are listed on the Xubuntu download page too.\n", "Q: Nvidia optimus hdmi out tutorial not working correctly After recently installing ubuntu 12.04 Desktop Edition lts on my nvida optimus equipped laptop (ASUS N53J) I tried to get hdmi out to work by using the method described in this guide here.

I wasn't clear from reading your question.\nI have an ASUS N56VM and I was able to get mplayer running on the external monitor (connected with HDMI) using bumblebee. Audio doesn't work, unfortunately. I followed the instructions under the heading \"extra screen\" on this link:\nhttps://github.com/Bumblebee-Project/Bumblebee/wiki/Multi-monitor-setup\nHere is a copy/paste of the info from that link:\n\nIn order to use an external monitor through the nvidia chip, power\n  management must be disabled for this. Edit\n  /etc/bumblebee/bumblebee.conf and change PmMethod=auto to\n  PmMethod=none (twice).\nextra screen\n(blob only) In /etc/bumblebee/bumblebee.conf, change\n  KeepUnusedXServer=false to KeepUnusedXServer=true. Remove the UseEDID\n  and Option \"AutoAddDevices\" \"false\" lines in\n  /etc/bumblebee/xorg.conf.nvidia. Trigger a start of the X server with\n  optirun true.\nBefore running an application on the external monitor, adjust the\n  library path if necessary (or remove it for nouveau) and run:\nexport DISPLAY=:8\n  LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/usr/lib/nvidia-current:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH\nThen start your program at your choice (without optirun), it should\n  show up on the external monitor.\n\nAnd here is the original askubuntu link from which I got this trick. Perhaps it will be helpful for you too.\nHow do I get HDMI out working with Bumblebee?\n", "Q: Stuck At Almost Finished Copying Files To install Ubuntu I used the windows installer, and after reboot I'm stuck at \"almost finished copying files...\".\nHave been here for 20 minutes. Is this normal?\n\nA: It's not normal, but there have been a small number of reports of it lately. There could be causes such as graphics hangs in which case you could boot with nomodeset and see whether it makes a difference.\nOr capture the logs and attach them to a new bug report.  to get to a terminal when it's stuck, and run:\nsudo zip -r /host/ubuntu/logs.zip /var/log\n\nThen you can return to the installer GUI  or just reboot:\nsudo reboot\n\nYour logs can then be found under windows as C:\\ubuntu\\logs.zip (assuming you installed on the C: drive).\nIn your bug report you can mention your full computer specs (brand/model/graphics card) and the release of Ubuntu you are installing.\n", "Q: Installer hangs during installation at \"select location\" screen I never seem to be able to get a Linux distro to install.

Are there any commands that reports free (or used) space left on unmounted partitions?  The partitions will have either NTFS, FAT or Ext2|3|4 filesystems...  A bonus would be a program that also reported partitions without filesystems and unpartitioned free-space.\nI'm not after anything complex like gparted, just something giving a quick list of space used/left (like df).

I was working on installing wine. When I entered a command from online trying to figure it out the command ended with purge wine* because I had installed a wine package and it wouldn't boot. I figured I could delete it. \nIt started deleting all my applications on my system so I cancelled it by the time I realized.

I can get to the terminal from the login and I tried to use the command: sudo dpkg-reconfigure -phigh -a but it didn't help.\nIs there another idea I can try before I delete the partition and reinstall?\n\nA: If you have a network connection, you can always try something like sudo apt-get install ubuntu-desktop (I'm not sure what exactly was the command you ran).\nEven then it's not guaranteed this would work 100%, so just in case be prepared to re-install everything from scratch.

I was testing a few things and was wondering about the difference between --auto-deconfigure and --unpack.\ndpkg --auto-deconfigure --install P.deb\n\nIf P has a Break field such as:\nBreak: B\n\nand B is currently installed, then dpkg deconfigures B with a new status of \"half-configured.\"\nSimilarly, you could \"unpack\" B first:\ndpkg --install B.deb\n...\ndpkg --unpack B.deb\ndpkg --install P.deb\n\nIn which case B new status is \"unpacked.\"\nHowever, in both cases the /etc/B.conf file stays right there. So it looks like the package is still fully installed.\nMy question is: Why wouldn't dpkg remove or rename B.conf? Because when I just do the --unpack the configuration file is named:\n/etc/B.conf.dpkg-new\n\nwhich makes sense. In that case B is really not configured!\nIt seems to be that the --auto-deconfigure or --unpack commands should also rename the /etc/B.conf as /etc/B.conf.dpkg-new then a --configure can restore the file as expected.\nI guess that most software do not care whether a .conf exists and thus whether it is there or not doesn't make much difference in the end. Would that be the reason why they can as well leave it in place?\n\nA: Unless the package is purged, it's configuration files won't be deleted.\nConfiguration files can be modified by users, so we don't delete them unless requested.\n", "Q: Can we have broken software removed from the Software Center? The Ubuntu Software Center does a fantastic job of inviting new users to explore and try out the software in Ubuntu's repositories. I don't have much experience with it but recently decided to give it a go.

Is there any precedent for this kind of curation?\n\nA: File a bug against it.:\n\nThe bug must have the following elements:\n  \n  \n*\n  \n*which release to remove it from (e.g., hardy)\n  \n*whether to remove both the source package and all binary packages\n  \n*a rationale for why they should be removed\n  \n*confirmation that the binary packages have no rdepends (no other package depends on them)\n  \n  \n*\n  \n*There is checkrdepends in ubuntu-archive-tools, but it needs a mirror to work with.\n  \n*There is reverse-depends and reverse-build-depends in ubuntu-dev-tools, but they only check the architecture you are running on, not all of them. \n  \n  \n  \n  If you are not an Ubuntu developer use the following process. If you are then subscribe the \"ubuntu-archive\" team to the bugs.

Everything went fine and I was happily using Ubuntu until I found out that it was the 32 bit version. I want to use the 64 bit version since I just spent the money to replace my old computer with a 64 bit system. I created a DVD with the 64 bit ISO from the Ubuntu site and installed that. The installation goes fine and says that it completes successfully but when I reboot the system I get a message\nerror: file '/boot/grub/i386-pc/normal.mod' not found\ngrub rescue\n\nI can boot from the install DVD and I can see that 64 bit Ubuntu runs fine on my system and have used that to try some of the suggestions I have seen on this site and on google but have not found one that works.\nFrom the grub prompt and from running the Ubuntu dvd I can see that I do have a directory named /boot/grub/x86_64-efi which seems like the 64 bit analogue to i386-pc directory and which has a lot of .mod files in it. To my simple understanding it seems like grub is confused and is looking for its mod files in the 32 bit directory which doesn't exist rather than in the the 64 bit directory which does exist. And then, it seems like if I could tell grub to look in the right place I might be on my way to getting Ubuntu to boot.\nDoes anybody have a solution for this problem?\n\nA: I resolved this problem.\nI did two things and have no idea which of them was the one that solved the problem.\nI had 2 disks on the system. One was a solid state drive and the other was a traditional mechanical hard disk. I unplugged the solid state drive.\nThen I reinstalled from the dvd. When I got to the part where I partitioned the drive I set up the partitions I wanted and then selected continue. The installer responded with a warning that I had not set up an efi boot partition and one of at least 35 MB was required. I went back and added a 40 MB efi boot partition. (This is one of the options in the partition type selection list and is not the same as /boot) The installation completed and I rebooted and the system loaded and is running just fine.\nThat efi boot partition warning never came up during the 3 previous times that I tried to install Ubuntu on the SDD. So I don't know if the problem was in installing the 64 bit version on the SDD or the fact that I didn't create a efi boot partition. I do know that the 32 bit version installed and ran from the SDD.\nI am knew to this forum and don't know how to close a ticket and I don't see a button to do that on this page. But if someone wants to mark this as solved, that is fine with me.

I accidentally opened Orca Screen Reader from the Dash when I was trying to open Screenshot. Now everything I type or click on is spoken out loud.\nHow do I make it stop?\nFor reference, here is a screenshot of Orca Screen Reader running:\n\n\nA: In the spirit of Ubuntu and greater linux open source philosophies that every user should be able to use all software regardless of disability 1, here are a few inclusive solutions that extend beyond users who don't need or want to use Orca.\nDisable Orca with Shorcut Keys Alt + Super + S\nAccording the official accessibility documentation, disabling Orca can be toggled with hotkeys:\nAlt + Super + S\nOf course, if you're running a stand alone window manager like openbox (talking to you, Lubuntu users), the keybindings are different. The rc.xml would have to be configured by you to include an execute action for Orca. See http://openbox.org/wiki/Help:Bindings\nOr use one of the following methods...\nDisable Orca from command line\nUsing GSettings\nThe screen reader can be disabled through gsettings with this command:\ngsettings set org.gnome.desktop.a11y.applications screen-reader-enabled false\nIt seems to send a SIGTERM to the Orca process which will allow Orca to issue an audible \"Screen reader off\" notification before terminating the process. This seems to be the cleanest way to disable speech, but because Orca is no longer running, the user will lose other options they may be using (braille and braille-monitor).\nUsing Orca\nThis method is useful for users who wish to disable speech while continuing to use other screenreader options — braille and braille-monitor.  \nTo restart Orca with speech disabled, use this command:\nnohup orca -d speech --replace & \nThe nohup and & have been included so it will run in the background without killing the process if the user closes the terminal.  \nThis command kills any running Orca process, probably with a SIGKILL, which means Orca does not get a chance to issue the audible confirmation \"Screen reader off.\" Technically it's not off though, because it replaces it with a new Orca process using the options given. \nThis method can be used to disable or enable any particular option. Run man orca for details.  \n\n   -e, --enable=speech|braille|braille-monitor\n          When starting orca, force the enabling of the supplied options.\n\n   -d, --disable=speech|braille|braille-monitor\n          When starting orca, force the disabling of the supplied options.\n\n   --replace\n          Replace  a  currently running orca process.  By default, if orca\n          detects an existing orca process for the same session,  it  will\n          not start a new orca process.  This option will kill and cleanup\n          after any existing orca process and then start a new orca in its\n          place.\n\n\nConfigure Orca's autostart settings\nAdmins and users may control whether Orca runs at startup. This can be done globally for all users or per individual user in your network. An individual user's autostart settings override global settings. \nEasy way\nYour desktop environment probably has a graphical session manager where you can remove Orca from the startup apps list. For example:  \n\n\n*\n\n*Gnome\nRun gnome-session-properties in terminal.  \n\n*LXDE\nRun lxsession-default-apps in terminal.  \n\n*XFCE\nRun xfce4-session in terminal.  \n\n\nAdvanced methods\nChanging the autostart settings manually should be available to everyone via terminal, regardless of the desktop environment.\nEdit the file orca-autostart.desktop in a text editor or, if it doesn't exist, create it in the autostart directory:  \n\n\n*\n\n*Autostart directory for an individual user example:\n/home/mattmurdock/.config/autostart/  \n\n*Autostart directory for all users:\n/etc/xdg/autostart/\nIf you're not sure whether the above paths are correct, you can probably find it quickly by running locate \"orca-autostart.desktop\".  \nTo disable the autostart of Orca, make sure to include the line NotShowIn=<desktop-environment>;  replacing <desktop-environment> with the one(s) you wish to disable it for, each followed by a semicolon. 2\nFor example, to disable autostart of Orca in Gnome, XFCE, and LXDE, the file should read as below:  \n[Desktop Entry]\nType=Application\nName=Orca screen reader\nExec=orca\nNoDisplay=true\nAutostartCondition=GSettings org.gnome.desktop.a11y.applications screen-reader-enabled\nX-GNOME-AutoRestart=true\nX-Ubuntu-Gettext-Domain=orca\nNotShowIn=Gnome;XFCE;LXDE;\n\n\nA: Click on the \"universal access\" icon near the top right of your screen, turn \"screen reader\" on then turn it off. \n\nA: From the manual for Orca:\n\nInsert+Q quit orca.\n\nI've filed a bug about the poor user experience that results from Orca's current behavior.\n\nA: Keyboard Shortcut\nAlt+Super+S also works to turn Orca off (or on).\nUbuntu 18.04+ : Configure the Keyboard Shortcut\nIn Ubuntu 18.04+, this keyboard shortcut is configured as follows...\n\n*\n\n*Open \"System Settings\"\n\n*Select \"Keyboard Shortcuts\" in the left panel\n\n*Scroll to the \"Universal Access\" section in the right panel\n\n*Click \"Turn screen reader on or off\"\n\n*In the pop-up dialog, enter a new key combination to toggle Orca on or off\n\n\nUbuntu 18.04+ : Turn Off Orca using the GUI\nYou can also turn off Orca using the GUI. In Ubuntu 18.04+, the steps are...\n\n*\n\n*Open \"System Settings\"\n\n*Select \"Universal Access\" in the left panel\n\n*Scroll to the \"Seeing\" section in the right panel\n\n*Click \"Screen Reader\n\n*In the pop-up dialog, slide the toggle to the left to turn off Orca\n\n\nUbuntu 14.04 : Configure the Keyboard Shortcut\nIn Ubuntu 14.04, this keyboard shortcut is configured as follows...\n\n*\n\n*Open \"System Settings\"\n\n*Select \"Keyboard\"\n\n*Select \"Shortcuts\" tab\n\n*In the left panel, select \"Universal Access\"\n\n*In the right panel, select \"Turn screen reader on or off\"\n\n*Enter a new key combination to toggle Orca on or off.\n\n\n\nA: You can kill the Orca Process in terminal by:\npkill orca\n\nIf there are few processes running:\nps ax | grep orca\n\n \nBeginning of the resulting line /s there is Process ID /s. Then copy the Process ID /s  and enter:\nsudo kill -9 <process id1> <process id2>\n\n\nA: What you do to turn it off forever is go to Start and type orca screen reader, right click, and press uninstall. After your password, reboot. You should not have Orca on anymore.\n\nA: If you don't need assistance, you might want to consider:\nsudo apt-get remove orca\nsudo apt-get remove gnome-orca\nkillall orca\n\nI say this from the unpleasant experience of accidentally triggering it on several occasions. It is a sledgehammer approach but I have absolutely no use for it.\nIf you want to keep it but it's starting on boot now, short of hunting through the application to look for the off-switch, consider this question too.\nAlso note that the package name is transitioning from gnome-orca to orca. I'm leaving both above for the duration of supported releases.\n\nA: *\n\n*Turn off sound\n\n*Open a terminal \n\n*$ killall orca\n\n*Turn on sound again\n\n\nA: Gui Method:\nOpen up System Settings, click on the button that reads universal access, click on the tab seeing and on that tab page turn the screen reader from on to off. Or, if the screen reader was started some other way, turn it on and then off again.\n\nA: KDE Accessibility Options appears able to start Orca on boot.\n\n\nA: pgrep orca\n\nwill tell you the process id of the current running orca process. pgrep is like grep for processes.\nkill $(pgrep orca)\n\nwill kill the current running orca process. kill takes a process id as argument.\n", "Q: Password not accepted at login I had tried to setup kerberos authentication to log into some ADS thing at my new university, however that didn't work and resulted in me having to enter my password twice for everything.\nSo I did: sudo apt-get remove libpam-krb5\nThen some authentication tool came up asking if I wanted to ignore local changes(?) to which I entered yes.

I had a few issues on Ubuntu that I did not know how to solve,  including not being unable to boot. I discovered that I could reinstall Ubuntu from an USB pendrive.\nIt has been said that the files would be safe if I reinstalled and used the same username and password.\nI did that but all my files are missing.\nHow do I recover my files?\n\nA: \nIt has been said that the files would be safe if I reinstalled and used the same username and password.\n\nWhoever said that lied to you. Unless you had /home on a separate partition, and in the new install chose to not format that partition, your files are unrecoverably gone. And even if /home was separate, if it was encrypted I hope you backed up the encryption key. Otherwise the files are still gone.\n\nA: Did you have a /home partition on your hard drive on your earlier Ubuntu? If you had a separate /home partition and you didn't reformat that during installation your files should be still there but not visible due to the partition not being mounted.\nMore likely, you formatted your whole drive and your files are more or less lost. I personally never used them but there are several tools to recover lost files. You might want to have a look into photorec or testdisk. I think Testdisk should be your main candidate, as it is able to recover whole partitions. Have a look at the following articles: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/DataRecovery and http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=387922.\n\nA: On re-installing Ubuntu use option \"Upgrade\" to not wipe all home directories. You may then have created a new account rather than using the existing one. In case your file system was not encrypted your data may still be present in the home directory of your previous user. To test this open Nautilus and point it to \"File System -> /home.

It gets installed successfully but now I am only able to see an empty desktop. I could not find any softwares anywhere in home etc, no where. Where are Firefox and all other softwares?\nI clicked Ubuntu help and it says about launcher but I don't have it how to get that?\n\nA: If you have a standard installation you just have to move your mouse to the left edge of the screen and the Launcher will show. Alternatively you can simply press the Windows key on your keyboard (referred to as \"Super\" on Linux) and the Dash will open, where you can type in the name of any Program you search. If this does not work try right clicking on your desktop and click \"Change Desktop background\" (or something similar, my Ubuntu is not in English).There you can configure the behaviour of the Unity launcher. If all that does not work, Press Ctrl+Alt+T and type software-center into the opened terminal. Then search for unity and reinstall the package.\n\nA: Unity is supposed to realise that the graphics drivers don't supply 3D accelleration and should automatically fall back to the 2D mode. As you probably found out, this does not always work in Ubuntu 12.04 (I never tried it, but it seems this issue is fixed in 12.10). \nIf you have an nvidia or AMD graphics chip, you probably need to install proprietary graphics drivers if you want Unity to start. To do this, I recommend to first log in using the Unity2D session (you can select what kind of session you want on the login screen, by clicking on the Ubuntu Icon next to your username, at least if you haven't configured your system to automatically log you in). Once you are logged in and got a working Unity 2D, find the system settings. They should be in one of the menus on the top right of your screen. In the system settings you'll find an entry called \"Additional drivers\". Find the one for your graphics card and install it. If you have a very new graphics card (for instance an AMD A-Series APU), choose the entry labelled with \"updates\", otherwise use the one without (more stable). If you are running an AMD graphics card, the entry with \"updates\" gives an error, which you can safely ignore. After installing the suitable graphics driver, you should reboot your PC. If everything worked, you can now select \"Unity\" as your session, again by clicking the Ubuntu Icon on the log-in page.\nOne final rant: I consider Unity not yet ready for release and I don't understand why Canonical decided to ship it as default desktop, despite its premature and unstable state.\n", "Q: How to install packages to /opt or any other folder instead of their original path? Some packages, like Adobe Reader and NetBeans, allow installation to /opt folder for global use. However, what should I do to install regular applications to the /opt folder?\nDo I have an option to install applications in any folder I want like Windows?\n\nA: It depends on how the software is packaged.\n\n\n*\n\n*If your software comes with an installer it may let you select where you want to install them;\n\n*If you are building your software from source, usually you can also select where it will be placed (with --prefix and DESTDIR for configure/make);\n\n*If you are installing your software from .debs (ie apt-get) you can't choose that. They use / as the \"base path\".\n\n\nRegarding the last statement, please note that a .deb is basically a compressed archive with a tree structure similar to the one the package will have when installed, so you can extract them and place whenever you want.

Once you fill ANY disk in a raid0 array, the array is full because you no longer have room on that disk to write its piece of a stripe.\nThat ~3TB device is just too much larger than the other devices you have to make full use of it in a btrfs-raid0 practical. To try to force the system to use the whole disk, you'd end up needing to partition it and then add both partitions as separate disks. DON'T DO THAT, by the way, as it will do weird and awful things to performance, which I would assume is pretty critical to you if you're using raid0...?\nAnother note: 3.2 is a pretty ancient kernel to be running btrfs IMO.  Btrfs is still in HEAVY development, and you really should be tracking much newer kernels if you're going to run btrfs.\nUsing Btrfs with Multiple Devices - Filesystem creation: When you have drives with differing sizes and want to use the full capacity of each drive, you have to use the single profile for the data blocks, rather than raid0:\n# Use full capacity of multiple drives with different sizes (metadata mirrored, data not mirrored and not striped)  \nmkfs.btrfs -d single /dev/sdb /dev/sdc\n\n", "Q: How do you reorder widgets in Glade? How can I reorder widgets in the Glade widget tree?\nFor example, assume I have a Glade application that contains this partial tree:\nbox1 (GtkBox)\n|--button1 (GtkButton)\n|--button2 (GtkButton)\n|--button3 (GtkButton)\n\nHow can I swap the position of e.g. button1 with e.g. button2, so that button2 will be above button1 in the UI?\n\nA: Upon further investigation, it appears that you cannot modify the order from the widget tree panel. However, you can still modify order in the visual editor.\nIn the toolbar, there are a couple of buttons for selecting cursor modes. Click the button right after the cursor. It should have four arrows. Then click on the widget that you want to move, and drag it where you want to move it to.\n\nA: Stumbled across this, and found that the accepted answer is incorrect, or at least is no longer correct in current versions of Glade.\nFrom within Glade, you can adjust the Position property under the Packing tab, whose value determines the index of the widget within its parent.\nSo in OP's example:\nbox1 (GtkBox)\n|--button1 (GtkButton) (Position: 0)\n|--button2 (GtkButton) (Position: 1)\n|--button3 (GtkButton) (Position: 2)\n\nEach button would have a Position value of 0, 1, and 2 respectfully. If you were to change the Position value of button2 to 0, it would move it up and button1 would then have a Position value of 1, which changes the order both in the tree and how it is displayed in the designer and final application.\nbox1 (GtkBox)\n|--button2 (GtkButton) (Position: 0)\n|--button1 (GtkButton) (Position: 1)\n|--button3 (GtkButton) (Position: 2)\n\n", "Q: Find source of Partial Upgrade dialog in 12.10 I'm running Xubuntu 12.10 and started getting the \"Partial Upgrade\" dialog from Software Updater a few weeks ago. I did some reading, and from what I understand, this can solve itself within a short time, or it might be caused by certain packages, especially ones coming from PPAs. I also saw lots of advice against going through with the \"Partial Upgrade\", as it would effectively do an apt-get dist-upgrade.\nIt seems like if you just press the \"Continue\" button instead of agreeing to the Partial Upgrade, it just upgrades what packages it's able to. I've done that, and ran apt-get update several times now over the past three weeks, but I'm still getting the Partial Upgrade dialog every time I run Software Updater. I haven't run the Partial Upgrade because it sounds like that may upgrade my entire system to 13.04, which I definitely don't want.\nSo my question is: How can I pinpoint exactly which packages are causing the problem? Is there a simple way to do this, from the command line or in Synaptic or wherever? If it's a PPA then I'll just remove/reinstall that, but I need to know which one it is.\n\nA: Partial Upgrade (and apt-get dist-upgrade) don't upgrade your system to the new development version. There are sometimes certain dependency chains which may require a partial upgrade (or dist-upgrade) for packages to install or remove, to ensure the upgrade will work. In these cases, the software updater says you need to do a \"Partial Upgrade\" (which is perhaps quite bad wording). If you use PPAs for various packages, this may happen more often, as the PPA might diverge a bit in what dependencies are used in some packages.\nYou should probably go ahead and do it. The updater should notify you of what extra packages would be installed or removed (apt-get dist-upgrade will for sure), and unless there is a specific problem with that, it's safe to go ahead with it.\n", "Q: juju local error ERROR could not connect before timeout juju -v status:\n2013-04-07 18:11:20,888 DEBUG Initializing juju status runtime\n2013-04-07 18:11:20,902:3553(0x7f739cef7700):ZOO_INFO@log_env@658: Client environment:zookeeper.version=zookeeper C client 3.3.6\n2013-04-07 18:11:20,903:3553(0x7f739cef7700):ZOO_INFO@log_env@662: Client environment:host.name=ubuntu\n2013-04-07 18:11:20,903:3553(0x7f739cef7700):ZOO_INFO@log_env@669: Client environment:os.name=Linux\n2013-04-07 18:11:20,903:3553(0x7f739cef7700):ZOO_INFO@log_env@670: Client environment:os.arch=3.5.0-26-generic\n2013-04-07 18:11:20,903:3553(0x7f739cef7700):ZOO_INFO@log_env@671: Client environment:os.version=#42-Ubuntu SMP Fri Mar 8 23:18:20 UTC 2013\n2013-04-07 18:11:20,903:3553(0x7f739cef7700):ZOO_INFO@log_env@679: Client environment:user.name=alok\n2013-04-07 18:11:20,903:3553(0x7f739cef7700):ZOO_INFO@log_env@687: Client environment:user.home=/home/alok\n2013-04-07 18:11:20,903:3553(0x7f739cef7700):ZOO_INFO@log_env@699: Client environment:user.dir=/home/alok\n2013-04-07 18:11:20,903:3553(0x7f739cef7700):ZOO_INFO@zookeeper_init@727: Initiating client connection, host=10.0.3.1:50094 sessionTimeout=10000 watcher=0x7f739c609700 sessionId=0 sessionPasswd=<null> context=0x3684740 flags=0\n2013-04-07 18:11:20,903:3553(0x7f73984cb700):ZOO_ERROR@handle_socket_error_msg@1579: Socket [10.0.3.1:50094] zk retcode=-4, errno=111(Connection refused): server refused to accept the client\n2013-04-07 18:11:24,237:3553(0x7f73984cb700):ZOO_ERROR@handle_socket_error_msg@1579: Socket [10.0.3.1:50094] zk retcode=-4, errno=111(Connection refused): server refused to accept the client\n2013-04-07 18:11:27,573:3553(0x7f73984cb700):ZOO_ERROR@handle_socket_error_msg@1579: Socket [10.0.3.1:50094] zk retcode=-4, errno=111(Connection refused): server refused to accept the client\n2013-04-07 18:11:30,909:3553(0x7f73984cb700):ZOO_ERROR@handle_socket_error_msg@1579: Socket [10.0.3.1:50094] zk retcode=-4, errno=111(Connection refused): server refused to accept the client\nTraceback (most recent call last):\nFailure: txzookeeper.client.ConnectionTimeoutException: could not connect before timeout\n2013-04-07 18:11:30,909 ERROR Traceback (most recent call last):\nFailure: txzookeeper.client.ConnectionTimeoutException: could not connect before timeout\n\n2013-04-07 18:11:30,910 ERROR could not connect before timeout\n\nPlease anyone tell me what is the problem.

The other day I went to use the new nvprof command line profiler and was greeted with the following error:\nError: unable to locate profiling library libcuinj64.so.5.0.35.\n\nI double checked the CUDA libraries and that specific library is in fact included in the LD_LIBRARY_PATH.

At this point the old command line compiler works fine, the compiler itself works fine, so it seems to be nvprof specific.  \nI'm not sure if this is Ubuntu or the nvprof build provided by NVIDIA.  Does anyone have an experience with running nvprof under 12.04 or even 12.10?  Anyone seen this problem before?  I realize this is a fairly niche question but you never know.\nUPDATE: This problem seems to persist on Ubuntu 12.04 with CUDA 5.5 (released on August 1, 2013).  The fix still works, you just have to use the updated library (see below).\n\nA: I know this is old, but this is still the first hit on google for this problem and I wanted to let people know how to fix it. Looking at strace told me that it wasn't finding the library in any of the paths (looks like it is looking through a different set of folders for some reason). Regardless, I just linked my copy of the library into one of the directories that it was looking at, and it worked perfectly fine. I ran this code:\nsudo ln -s `locate libcuinj64.so.5.0.35` /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libcuinj64.so.5.0.35 \n\nYou can just run the locate command on its own if you want to put it in manually, but if you only have one copy of the library this will work fine. Create the upper level directory first if you don't have it for some reason: \nsudo mkdir -p /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/\n\nHope this helps!\nUpdate for CUDA 5.5:  The library for CUDA 5.5 is libcuinj64.so.5.5.22.  So, the one line command is:\nsudo ln -s `locate libcuinj64.so.5.5.22` /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libcuinj64.so.5.5.22\n\n\nA: It's probably due to a not correctly set $LD_LIBRARY_PATH. This environment variable should include the path to the CUDA library. Example:\nsetenv QUDA_INSTALL_PATH /usr/local/cuda/lib64 \n\nsetenv LD_LIBRARY_PATH $QUDA_INSTALL_PATH/lib64:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH\n\n", "Q: Can I clone my existing Ubuntu 12.10 and install to USB I have Ubuntu 12.10 installed from scratch.

Is Ubuntu also able to have a background image outside the X-Windows system?\n\nA: Install FBTerm to have a colored Background image on console\nCompile fbv - FrameBufferViewer\nFirst of all you need to compile fbv to be able to print the background image to fbterm.\nTo prepare this go to your console and enter\nsudo apt-get install build-essential checkinstall make\n\nNext we need to obtain the fbv source. You can get it from the author's website\nNow extract the source with\ntar xfv fbv-1.0b.tar.gz\n\ngo to the directory and then type ./configure.\nas you see there are some dependencies\n\n*\n\n*libungif\n\n*libjpeg and\n\n*libpng\n\nit's a bit complicated to locate them on Ubuntu. Just enter:\nsudo apt-get install lipungif lipjpeg-dev libpng12-dev\n\nNow you are ready to compile fbv \"Framebuffer Viewer\". Enter ./configure again.\nnow enter\nsudo checkinstall\n\nEnter Y for the question after documentation files.\nNow enter Framebuffer Viewer and hit return once more.\nenter 3 to change the version string to `1.0b' hit return\nenter 10 to specify dependencies in a comma separated list. These are the libs named above\nlibungif.libjpeg,-dev,libpng12-dev\n\nnow you can confirm the rest of the prompts with return.\nWell done, you've compiled fbv from the source and installed it to your system.\nBut we like to install FbTerm so this will be the next step\nInstall FBTerm and setup a background image\nFirst we simple install the fbterm package with apt-get\nsudo apt-get install fbterm\n\nTo grant access to VESA for fbterm we need to add the user to the video group as explained above. So we need to enter\nsudo usermod -a -G video $USER\n\nNow we need to create a shell script that starts fbterm and setup a background image for us. See FBTerm Man Pages. As you can see this is the part of the installation that needs fbv.\nCopy and paste the bash script to a new text file or just rewrite the lines and save it with nano.\nFor example you can save it to /etc/fbterm.\nTo make sure it is executable chmod it with\nsudo chmod 755 /etc/fbterm\n\nThe effect of this script is if you go to /etc and enter ./fbterm path of image, fbterm will start and show up with the given background image.\nIf you try it you'll notice that fbterm prints an error message about the keymap and not given privileges. This is because fbterm has no root access yet.\nTo avoid this we'll need to set up another sh script.\nThe good part of this second script is you could specify a background image in here. But let's take a look.\n#!/bin/sh\n# This gives fbterm access to change the keymap\nsetcap 'cap_sys_tty_config+ep' /usr/bin/fbterm\n/etc/fbterm ~/Pictures/background.png\ncd\nexit\n\nNow we will chmod this script too\nsudo chmod 755 /init.d/fbterm\n\nFor now I'm not sure if the script works completely. Enter\nsudo setcap 'cap_sys_tty_config+ep' /usr/bin/fbterm\n\nto make it really sure\nStart FBTerm right after login\nFinally we need to start FBTerm with the given background image right after the user is successfully logged in. so we have to edit .profile in the user's homedir.\nGo to your homedir with cd ~ and enter nano .profile\nfinally add the line\nsh /etc/init.d/fbterm\n\nbelow the last commentary.\nWell done! Now you can see your image at console if you log back in\n", "Q: VNC Viewer on Firefox web I want to be able to connect VNC Viewer with Firefox using the IP number and the password from the computer that I want to see the desktop!\nThe problems is: I just can't. What do I have to install, besides Java to be able to connect using Firefox? I alredy have de VNCViewer installed with Wine but I wanted to use de FileTransfer opition that is only available when you acess it using the web VNC.\n\nA: Running from a web browser\nThe VNC servers also contain a small web server. If you connect to this with a web browser, you can download the Java version of the viewer, and use this to view the server. You can then see your desktop from any Java-capable browser, unless you are using a proxy to connect to the web. The server listens for HTTP connections on port 5800+display number. So to view display 2 on machine ADDRESS, you would point your web browser at:\nhttp://ADDRESS:5802/\nThe applet will prompt you for your password, and should then display the desktop.\nRunning as an application\nYou can run the viewer outside a browser using, for example:\njava -jar vncviewer ADDRESS:2\nThe precise command line will depend on your particular Java installation.\n\nA: You can connect from Linux-Firefox VNC with this web site - http://www.onlinevnc.com/ It uses Flash VNC viewer and Java does not required.

I need to install some program in wine, which require to access a mounted ISO image. Whenever I mount an ISO image in Nautilus, in which drive it mounted in Wine?\nFor some programs which can find the ISO automatically, I have no problem. \n\nA: After you mount the ISO or the disk with any tools or commands which you prefer, start Configure Wine create a new Drive mapping. Click Add, browse the path and select OK. Here, I've mapped Ubuntu 13.10 i386 DVD to drive letter e: in wine (g: is for my Flash Drive).\n\nThen you can browse the iso or disk in the $HOME/user/.wine's dosdrives directory. \n\n\nA: sudo mount -o loop /path/to.iso /mnt/cdrom/\n\n\nA: If you have mounted an .iso image in Ubuntu, Wine will treat it exactly as Ubuntu is treating it. So if you navigate to / with a Wine program (I think it is the Z:\\ folder), you will see all of your Ubuntu files and folders, and you can navigate to the mount point of the iso, which will be listed with the mount command in the terminal (it's probably somewhere in /mount)\n\nA: CDemu\nWe sucessfully mounted CD or DVD images for application installation in Wine or for running an application which needs access to its CD using CDemu. Amongst ISO a wide variety of other formats are supported. Therefore the image does not need to be in ISO format.\nThe application can be installed by adding the following ppa to our sources:\n\n*\n\n*ppa:cdemu/ppa\nWe can then install the CDemu client and the CDemu daemon with\nsudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install cdemu-daemon cdemu-client\n\nAfter logging out and back in, or a reboot, the daemon will be started. To mount an ISO file as CD we can then issue:\ncdemu load <number> <path_to_iso>\n\nThe <number> corresponds to the internal number of drives loaded by CDemu (per default 2 drives, change this in /etc/default/cdemu-daemon to a higher number if needed.\nThe following is an example command to load a drive 0 from an image.iso:\ncdemu load 0 /home/nur/images/image.iso\n\nThis will unload an image:\ncdemu unload <number> \n\nRelated questions:\n\n*\n\n*How do I use cdemu with Unity?\n\n*Apps capable of mounting/unmounting CD/DVD Images with multi-sector or protected format\n\n*How can I graphically mount ISOs?\n\nA: If you don't want to mount iso in Ubuntu, however want to mount iso in Wine only.\nRight click on iso file, select Open With -> Archive Manager. Unpack iso content into new folder e.g. iso.\n\nIn Wine go to Configure Wine select Drivers tab. Click Add... to add new driver, select any letter.

On it i have turned on DHCP Server, but i want to give static adresses to some devices (mac adresses) in my network, where I have to start? I tried to google it, and i was found nothing :(\n\nA: Giving a pc/server present in the lan a static ip address\nThis is necessary if you want to run a server on a pc inside the lan and need a port forwarded, for example a web server or bittorrent client.\nThis is quite a bit more complicated than for services running on the router itself, but still not too much of a challenge. First you have to set up the pc in the lan that runs the server (referred to from here on as the \"host\") with a static ip address. Because the ip addresses are allocated with DHCP, a host might be given a different ip address each time it connects to the network. You can easily give it a static ip address by telling the DHCP server to give it the same ip address each time.\nGo into webmin and click the \"Servers\" section and select the DHCP server. In the hosts section click \"Add a new host\". Fill the details as shown:\n\"Host description\" - Whatever you want, this is just to help you remember which host it is\n\"Host name\" - Set this to the hostname of the host. This can be found by executing hostname on the host pc.\n\"Hardware Address\" - This is the mac address of the host. This can be found be executing ifconfig on the host machine and looking at the mac address of the appropriate network card.\n\"Fixed IP address\" - This is the ip address you want to give the host. This ip address should be in your local lan and should not be included in the group of ip addresses you already told the dhcp server to hand out dynamically. If you have been following this guide, it should be 192.168.0.X where X is a number from 2 to 99 inclusive.\n\"Host assigned to\" - You can set this option to a subnet in order to use ip addresses within the dhcp dynamic allocation pool.\nCopied from this help page.\n", "Q: Install font for specific language I'm using Ubuntu in English.

I found a video on how to install ubuntu on chromebook but my question is that will an external optical drive work on Ubuntu that is installed on the chromebook?  Or will it not play like in chromeos?\nThanks Goku.\n\nA: I recommend looking further into the question of whether or not you can get the external optical drive to work in ChromeOS. As for Ubuntu, an external USB optical drive, like USB drives in general, should work without problems. To test this, create an Ubuntu live USB stick, boot a Chromebook from it, and see if the external optical drive works. (Don't install Ubuntu; instead select Try Ubuntu without installing and see if it can recognize the external optical drive.)\nIf you don't already have a Chromebook, you might or might not be able to persuade the staff of a store to let you test this. But since a Chromebook doesn't appear easily to do what you want it to do, this might not be the best computer for you.\nUltimately, USB drives of any kind usually work on Ubuntu without any problems, on any computer (so long as you can run Ubuntu on it). There is no 100% guarantee, however.\n", "Q: can not boot into ubuntu 12.10 only xp I installed ubuntu 12.10 using windows installer.\nWhen I rebooted the machine, it gave me the option of booting into xp or ubuntu.\nThe arrow keys would not work.\nIt was set on xp and I could not get it onto ubuntu.\nSo it booted onto xp.\nAny help would be greatly appreciated.\nAnthony \n\nA: Try plugging in a different keyboard:\nYou should try plugging in a corded USB or PS/2 keyboard, usually bluetooth keyboards don't work on lower level prompts.

I have this external HDD, which has two partitions: one ext4 and one ntfs.

At least to make it leave the partition alone and not try to do anything with it?\nThanks a lot!\n\nA: How to hide a(n) (NTFS) partition from ubuntu could be the solution you are looking for. It uses udev rules to achieve the result. If you are worried about changing device names, you could use UUID to mount the drive. blkid command will give you the UUID of the drive.\nOr if you want to totally disable NTFS support, you could blacklist the NTFS Linux kernel module by sudo gedit /etc/modprobe.d/blacklist.conf and adding the line blacklist ntfs. You might have to reboot for the changes to take effect. I have not tried this out.\n\nA: You could always uninstall ntfs-3g sudo apt-get purge ntfs-3g\nYou might also want to look into udev rules, they give you a very granular way of dealing with mounting/unmounting devices.\nHandy UDEV rules\nCreating UDEV rules\nWriting UDEV rules\n", "Q: What could be the cause for these strange UFW block entries in my syslog?

If anyone \"translated\" these so that I comprehend what's going on, I'd be very happy.\n\nA: \nMy guess is that it's the local router asking if there are any hosts\ninterested in receiving multicasts - nothing to worry about (see [1])\n\nYou can prevent the creation of new log entries with this command (works for me on 13.10 64 bit):\nsudo ufw deny from 192.168.178.1 to 224.0.0.1\n\nI cannot say if this will have negative side effects for your networked device(s).\nIf you want to see UFW firewall rules, type\nsudo ufw status numbered\nand if you want to get rid of it write\nsudo ufw delete 3\nif the rule you want to delete is rule number 3. Work your upwards in the rule list.\n\nA: I believe you have some service on your local network that is advertising itself or looking for clients. It's your \"default deny incoming\" rule that's blocking this traffic. Yours looks much like persistent noise I see on my home network, caused by a Multicast DNS server in my router.\nmDNS multicasts to 224.0.0.251, so that's not what yours is. You have something multicasting to 224.0.0.1, a generic \"all hosts\" address.

(Even using text in a music player like foobar2000 involves the same problem). \nWhat is the cause of this - and can this be fixed?\nI'm using Xfce\n\nI found this problem reported on here on Ubuntu Forums, but I cannot see how the Wikipedia link posted there can help.\n\nA: On a forum in Spanish I found the same problem with an answer saying: \n\ngo to Menu > System > Preferences > Keyboard > Layouts there you choose your keyboard and your layout and other options such as using the AltGr, then you hit Apply System Wide.\n\nIn Xfce I could not replicate the exact steps, but what I did was:\nUnder Menu > Settings > Keyboard (that is xfce4-keyboard-settings), under the Layout tab, I unchecked Use system defaults, selected the keyboard layout, and then set Alt Gr under Compose key. \n\n\nAfter a while, even without logging out, this solution stopped working, so I looked at the Keyboard Layouts properties (the Xfce panel keyboard applet, xfce4-xkb-plugin) and made the same setting there. Now it works even if the previous setting (in xfce4-keyboard-settings) is removed. \nThe two settings seem independent, but  the one that prevails in Xfce is that of the xfce4 panel applet. (The same is true for switching layouts: Alt-Shift was set and working for a long time in the xfce4-xkb-plugin while in xfce4-keyboard-settings this setting was absent. -- I leave the first part of the answer for reference and for possible use in other desktop environments.)\n\n(In Xfce and LXDE, there are cases where different apps are not completely integrated under a unified design, they handle the same or similar features, and it is not always clear if there is possible conflict or whether one prevails. Trial and error is the way here, starting by avoiding conflicting settings.)\n\nOn the subject of the two Xfce applications handling the same features, see this question.\n\nA: On Ubuntu 17.10 you can fix this by running gnome-tweak-tool and in the keyboard section activate Super right for compose key.\n", "Q: How can I use a Pip module with Quickly?

But I was wondering if there is a way to have the server running while I am on the Desktop version?\nDoes this make sense?\n\nA: You can chroot into the server system, but getting it to work properly as a server this way would be complicated and unworthwhile.\nInstead you should probably simply install the packages you need in the desktop system.\nThe only difference between Ubuntu Server and Ubuntu desktop is what packages are installed. An Ubuntu desktop system can be used as a server (and likewise, a GUI can be installed in Ubuntu Server).\nFor example, if you need the Apache web server, you can install the apache2 package.\nFor nginx (you tagged your question nginx but didn't mention it explicitly), you can choose between the following packages: nginx-full, nginx-light, and nginx-naxsi. Related packages you may want or not want (depending on your needs) are nginx-naxsi-ui and nginx-extras.\nIf your goal is to create a teaching/learning or development box:\nYou later mentioned:\n\nThis isn't for production, but due to my job, I will need to learn how\nto setup/update/manage servers, so I thought I would turn an old PC\ninto a server. I haven't used anything like virtual box as you cannot\naccess it remotely (as far as I am aware).\n\nVirtualBox (or another virtualization solution, if you prefer) is actually the best thing to use in this situation.\nYou can actually use VirtualBox and access it remotely, and since your goal is to practice with a system that works like a production server, it seems that's probably what you ought to do. The simplest and easiest way to make services on a virtual machine accessible to the outside physical network is to set up the VM's internet connection as bridged (rather than NAT).\nAs the VirtualBox manual says:\n\n[...] open the Settings dialog of a virtual machine, go to the\n\"Network\" page and select \"Bridged network\" in the drop down list for\nthe \"Attached to\" field. Finally, select desired host interface from\nthe list at the bottom of the page, which contains the physical\nnetwork interfaces of your systems.\n\nFeel free to post a new question about this if you have trouble getting servers on a VirtualBox guest system with a bridged network adapater accessible from the outside. Usually, there are no complications.\nWhile VirtualBox and other virtualization solutions generally can use an entire physical drive as a \"virtual\" device for a virtual machine--even, usually, an internal drive--you're not likely to succeed at making a VM use the single partition of a pre-existing system as its hard drive. So you'll have to create a new VM and install Ubuntu Server; you probably will not be able to make your VM run the copy of Ubuntu Server that is already installed. (Installing in the VM is easy though--it's the same procedure as installing on a physical machine, like you have done.)\n", "Q: Ubuntu Touch app with c++ core and QML interface. How to create?

I have got a wine installtion with a couple of games, most of which work fabulously. However, wine creates directories in my home for the player data, saves, etc.\nIs there a way to have those in ~/.winesaves or something similar? I would prefer wine not littering my home directory.\n(wine: 1.5.27, game in question was SCII and DE:IW)\n\nedit to clarify:\nEverything in ~/.wine is fine and good, but I don't want applications to create ~/GameSaves or the likes.\n\nA: You may need to experiment with the sandbox option present in winetricks, which may help you as all the Wine symlinks to $HOME are removed when that setting is applied to the default WINEPREFIX with winetricks sandbox. \nHowever, wine still has your user's permissions in the home folder, and often when installing a new program, an action in the installation can trigger the sandbox to be removed. So it is not really a true 'sandbox' at all, but it may be helpful for your use case. \nAt the official wine FAQ it is noted that:\n\nWinetricks does have a sandbox verb that does at least a partial job of isolating Wine programs from the rest of your system. It protects against errors rather than malice. It's useful for, e.g., keeping games from saving their settings in random subdirectories of your home directory. \n\nOn the official winetricks page, it is explained that\n\nIf you want to isolate an app so that it doesn't save anything to your home directory, you can try 'winetricks sandbox'. That will remove the symlinks to your home directory. Do this before saving any data, or you'll have to copy old saved data from your home directory into $WINEPREFIX/drive_c/users/$USERNAME. \n\nImportant notes\n\n\n*\n\n*The wine sandbox option will likely need to be used repeatedly, i.e. include it in a launcher script that runs winetricks sandbox and then launches your game, as a number of things in wine can trigger the rebuilding of the symlinks.\n\n*The folder of saves you have already generated will need to be moved to your WINEPREFIX, e.g /home/$USER/.wine/drive_c/users/$USER/\"My Documents\" in order for you to resume your game. If wine has just created a folder called ~/gamesaves, simply move that folder to the location mentioned above. Otherwise, observe the directory structure; if a game save folder is ~/Documents/Syberia/save make sure you create an equivalent in /home/$USER/.wine/drive_c/users/$USER/\"My Documents\". \n\n*When you install a game in the future, make sure you run winetricks sandbox at the start, so that the game will automatically start using your WINEPREFIX as the save location, and not a folder in your $HOME.\n\nA: Not a complete solution to fully block wine from modifying the home directory, but I find this works to prevent most programs from polluting my home directory, and is quite a clean solution. \nMost of the time (in my experience) when a program running through wine is accessing outside the \"~/.wine\" folder, it's doing so through symbolic links in the \"~/.wine\" directory. For example, I had an installer install a folder in my home directory, when really it was trying to install in \"C:/users/user name/My Documents\" which wine redirects to    \"~/.wine/drive_c/users/user name/My Documents\". It turns out \"My Documents\" here is actually a symbolic link to my home directory, \"~\". \nSo simply removing the symbolic link \"My Documents\" and creating a folder \"My Documents\" in \"~/.wine/drive_c/users/user name/My Documents\" did the trick for me. \nPS. I'm surprised I couldn't seem to find this answer around given this question is 6 years old but maybe I just didn't look around enough, so please let me know if this post is redundant.\n\nA: What worked for me was to create a wrapper around wine that launched wine with a different HOME. E.g. you can create your own ~/bin/wine (assuming ~/bin is in your PATH), which sets:\n#!/bin/sh\nexport \"HOME=$HOME/.wine/home\"\nexec /usr/bin/wine \"$@\"\n\nWith an empty WINEPREFIX (~/.wine/), Wine will create the symbolic links to its own private home directory in ~/.wine/home/.\nYou can expand this further to multiple wrappers for different Wine prefixes (e.g. for 32-bit vs. 64-bit).\n\nA: If you have bubblewrap installed, you can use its mechanisms to limit filesystem access.\nExample1. You want wine to have access to ~/.wine , ~/Downloads, but nothing else. You may use this command then:\nbwrap --dev-bind / / --tmpfs ~ --bind ~/.wine ~/.wine --bind ~/Downloads ~/Downloads --new-session wine ~/.wine/path-to-your-program\nIn the command above, we create a new namespace, bind the root /, bind an in-memory filesystem to ~, and bind two directories above the ~. Any changes done outside of those 2 directories will go into tmpfs and will be lost once bubblewrap (and your program) exits.\nExample2. You don't want complex hierarchies, you just want all wine-related stuff to live in ~/.bubblewrap-wine-container. And nowhere else. In this case, you can use:\nbwrap --dev-bind / / --bind ~/.bubblewrap-wine-container ~ --new-session wine path-to-your-program-relative-to-this-directory\nIf you want to forbid internet access for any of those examples, add --unshare-net argument. Or maybe even --unshare-all to see if it'll launch. Refer to bubblewrap documentation for further details.\n", "Q: Making a Bootable USB flash drive which will boot in EFI I have recently bought a laptop with windows 8 (EFI) installed.  I thought I'd be able to handle installing 12.04.2 relatively easily - how wrong could I be?  \nUsing a live-usb I made using startup disk creator on ubuntu with a 64 bit .iso file...\n*I First tried to install ubuntu in legacy mode without a boot partition which needless to say didn't work.\n*I then reinstalled ubuntu with the boot partition, still using legacy.  This time I managed to get the grub menu to show up but I only had the choice of booting into Ubuntu.  (unless I told it to boot in EFI mode and then it only booted windows)\n*I tried boot-repair both times and that didn't help things at all.  \nI now realise I can't boot ubuntu in legacy mode if windows is booting in EFI.\nSo I need to boot from the live-usb in EFI mode.  But when I enable EFI mode and boot from USB FLASH DRIVE it says: FLASH DRIVE HAS BEEN BLOCKED BY THE CURRENT SECURITY POLICY.  (or something to that effect)  \nIs there a problem with the way I made the live-usb?\nHow am I supposed to boot from the live-usb in EFI mode if I get the error message each time?\nI realise lots of people are asking these sorts of questions at the moment, but I've been looking for a while and I haven't found any solutions that work. :/  Thanks for your help!\n\nA: Go in your BIOS settings and disable secure boot. There must be an option somewhere. \n\nA: In my case after setting the admin password I had to clear the EFI image on the USB pendrive for boot (I had an entry on a different BIOS page that let me do that).\nBTW, after installing, I had to do the same with the shim64.efi image that the installer put on the HD and then I had to change the boot priority of the \"ubuntu\" boot image over the windows 8 one.\n\nA: The Ubuntu 12.04.2 64 bit or the Ubuntu 12.10 64 bit should both be capable of being booted on a machine with secure boot turned on.  If there are problems, it may be the fault of the machine -- this is a new area and the vendors are still working things out.  For instance, Toshiba's got a firmware update (6.60) to straighten out a key/database problem in Jan 2013.  Check your vendor for the latest firmware.\n  There may be other problems with getting the install to work, usually a result of getting the EFI directory files messed up.  The first thing you should do after successfully booting the live media is to back up the files in /boot/efi (this set will boot Windows).  After the install, back them up again to another location (this set should boot Ubuntu).  Boot-repair may fix problems with these files, but some problems are not fixable.  For instance, grub may successfully boot Ubuntu, but fail to boot windows, even with all the correct commands.  You will need to ensure first you even have the correct commands since you did the MBR change.  For non-fixable problems, fall back to a second boot device with it's own copy of the EFI partition and files.  That way, you can boot Windows off one set, and Ubuntu off the other.\n\nA: I wanted to be able to use Grub2 personally. I run Linux mint but it's similar enough in this respect that it should work regardless, I've even applied the same principles to install red hat as well so I could study for the RHCSA and RHCE exams (wish me luck). \n\n\n*\n\n*Disable secure boot and enable both legacy and efi booting\n\n*burn a normal x64 Ubuntu/Linux iso to a flash drive or DVD\n\n*boot into the DVD and perform a normal legacy installation, including installing grub2 to the root of /dev/sda, and make sure the live system is connected to the internet\n\n*once installation is complete and you're on your live DVD, take a deep breath and open a terminal\n\n*Live CD's don't let you use the root account and insist on using sudo but I have not seen any benefit to using sudo on the live disk vs simply becoming the root user and doing what you need to do.

If someone could explain me how to manage to open the .auz file and let Ableton work it would be amazing, cause i am really getting crazy and have no idea how to manage by myself. \nThank you in advance!!! \n\nA: I found a solution;\n\n\n*\n\n*Open your file browser and hit Ctrl+H to show hidden files, open the ~/.wine folder then the C: folder and Ableton should be in program files.\n\n*Open Live 8.2.2.exe (found in ~/.wine/drive_c/Program Files/Ableton/Live 8.2.2/Program) using Wine Windows Program Loader (right click, open with, wine windows program loader) \n\n*Once Ableton is running drag and drop the Authorize822.auz file onto the Ableton window.\n\n\nYou should then get a message telling you that Ableton has been authorised.\nHope this works for you.\nJust a small side point, Ableton Live 8.2.2 will run without having been authorised, however you can not save any of your work.\n", "Q: how to check if cache is working is there a way to check if disk cache is working on a regular sata disk? \ni see \"asking for disk cache failed\" error messages, but discovered my laptop has a 1gb solid state drive without a partition. i saw it in disk utility.\nso if i can confirm that the hdd has a working cache then my next goal will be to setup ubuntu to use the solid state for swap instead of the swap area on the hdd.\n\nA: You should try to copy a file on the disk and then you should type\nfree -m\n\nin your terminal.

I'd like to make it bootable and 'portable'. Would it be able to recognize host machine's network card for instance? For the sake of experiment I installed latest distro of Suse (curiosity). All went well except when it booted it would not recognize my wireless network. I shut down the laptop I had it plugged into, un-plugged it and tried to boot the laptop. Of course grub was hosed ( fixed it with no problems ). The interesting thing was when I booted from Ubuntu Live CD to fix grub, my wireless network was recognized just fine.

Hopefully you can find a newer printer driver. Maybe your 12.04 install is not compatible with the latest driver or you have chosen to use the open source drivers instead of the proprietary drivers from your printer's manufacturer? The proprietary drivers probably have more features.\nHere is someone's bug report about not seeing where to change the colour settings.\n\nA: I don't know why, but in my case Okular was having troubles to find the black & white option. So I tried Evince: Evince had no problem to find the black & white option (same printer, same driver). Then, I print one page, and tried Okular again: the option appeared!\nI have the feeling that some options related to the driver need some contact with the printer to work. Like printing a mock white page (ok, it's a bit stupid), or maybe a simple ping or scan is enough, I'm not sure (it may be required to restart Okular, I'm also not sure). I don't know yet if Evince always works directly or if I just got luck due to previous \"contacts\" made by Okular, but for sure Okular has some troubles.\n", "Q: How do I gracefully delete un-needed kernels? I'm running a bit low on disk space and noticed that I have several kernels that I'm probably never going to use taking up space. There was a program called computer janitor that cleaned things up (and a lot of things that you didn't want cleaned up), but I can't find it. Is there a preferred alternative?\nMany thanks!\n\nA: *\n\n*First, you need to see which kernel you currently use, because you\nmust not delete it. Yoy can see that using the command:\nuname -r\n\n*Then, you can see the installed kernels using the command:\ndpkg --list | grep linux-image\n\n*And you can delete an extra kernel, using apt-get like this:\nsudo apt-get purge linux-image-x.x.x-x-generic\nWhere x.x.x-x is the kernel you want to remove.\nRemember, you must not delete the one that is currently in use (the output from uname -r).\nYou should keep a second kernel as a back up, in case the first somehow fails.\nAn alternative, would be the Janitor of Ubuntu Tweak, which has the option of removing unused kernels.\n\nA: I wrote a Bash function for this very purpose.

The installer has\n    already transitioned to using OverlayFS (which was done in\n    Oneiric). \n\n\n\nOverlayfs \n\nhttp://blog.dustinkirkland.com/2012/08/introducing-overlayroot-overlayfs.html\n\nOverlayfs is a successor of a series of union filesystem implementations, such as unionfs, aufs, etc.  It creates a single unified view of two directories.  One is the \"lower\" filesystem -- in our case, this a read-only mount of our original, pristine Ubuntu AMI.  The second is the \"upper\" filesystem -- in our case, this is a read-write mount of an encrypted block device.  We’re hopeful that it might one day make it upstream into Linux, though progress on that seems to have stalled.  Thankfully, Ubuntu’s kernels are carrying it for now.\n\n\nYou should be focusing on overlayfs. See the accepted answer here: How do I use OverlayFS? on some documentation.\nGood luck. \n", "Q: How do I get Jmol to show implicit Hydrogens? For some reason when I use Jmol it fails to show implicit hydrogens even when I have the box labelled, \"Show Hydrogens\" ticked. How do I overcome this problem? I am running 32 bit 12.10 on a Dell Vostro 3500 laptop with 3.7 GB RAM and 4 2.53 GHz processors. It has never worked for me.

If you are using PDB files to import 3D structures you can alternatively use the console code set pdbAddHydrogens TRUE\n", "Q: Is there an application to manage config files in the /etc directory with version control? I want to use version control for config files in Ubuntu server.  \nBut I found it's not easy to simply use git for the whole /etc directory, because many files don't need to be tracked and sometimes the system will write to files like logs which should be ignored.  \nIs there an application that can do this and make it easy? If it is based on git that is better.\n\nA: The package etckeeper is specifically intended to manage your configuration files (located in the /etc directory) under a version control system(VCS).\nWhat is etckeeper?\n\netckeeper is a collection of tools to let /etc be stored in a git, mercurial, darcs, or bzr repository. It hooks into apt (and other package managers) to automatically commit changes made to /etc during package upgrades.\n\nHow do I install etckeeper?\nTo install the package, click on the link provided below to install in Ubuntu Software Center(USC), or run sudo apt-get install etckeeper from the terminal(Ctrl-Alt-t).\netckeeper\nHow do I change etckeeper from the default VCS(bzr) to use git? \nBy default, etckeeper uses Bazaar(bzr) for version control management. This can be changed in the configuration file /etc/etckeeper/etckeeper.conf.\nFirst, you will need to have git installed.\n\n\n*\n\n*sudo apt-get install git\n\n*sudo apt-get install git-core\nNow, you will need to edit your etckeeper.conf file to change your VCS. Here is what the first five lines of the default configuration should look like:\n# The VCS to use.\n# VCS=\"hg\"\n# VCS=\"git\"\nVCS=\"bzr\"\n# VCS=\"darcs\"\n\nThis is the place in the configuration file to switch from using the default option of using bzr to using a git repository. Open a text editor (i.e. gksu gedit /etc/etc/keeper/etckeeper.conf) and change the file to look like this:\n# The VCS to use.\n# VCS=\"hg\"\nVCS=\"git\"\n# VCS=\"bzr\"\n# VCS=\"darcs\"\n\nUncomment the line VCS=\"git\" and comment out the line VCS=\"bzr\"\nNow, run sudo etckeeper init to initialize your repository.\nAs mentioned here:\n\nThis sets up version control for all files in /etc. You don't need to do anything else to manage etckeeper; you only need to interact with it when you want to do a version control operation, such as referring to older files. Files are automatically committed before and after each run of apt and every night (this is configurable).\n\nAdditional information on etckeeper:\nSee Ubuntu etckeeper documentation\nalso\nUsing etckeeper with git on Ubuntu\n", "Q: How can I make Synergy accommodate the dead space around dual monitors? I have desktop with two monitors (monitors 1 and 2) and a laptop (monitor 3). I've placed the laptop below the desktop using Synergy's interactive configuration screen.\nThe resulting behavior is that one of the desktop's monitors connects to half of the laptop's screen:\n\nbut given the laptop's physical position, this arrangement would make more sense:\n\nHow can I make it do that?\n\nA: I would try using ranges. (I'm estimating that the amount of left to right spread that is the right monitor is 60 percent. Starting at 40% from the left and extending to 100%.) \nNotice the black space? That part counts. That's why I say to put it 40% in instead of 0% to 100%. Try this first one. \nsection: links\n    Desktop:\n        down(40,100) = Laptop\n    Laptop:\n        up = Desktop(40,100)\nend\n\nSo far, this is the best that I think it can do. I tried to figure out a way you could move from Desktop-Monitor1 or monitor 2, but I just ended up only being able to leave the right side of monitor 2, not monitor one. Same problem trying to make it so that you can leave Lappy and move left onto D1 - you end up arriving on D2 \n\nA: If i understand the problem correctly it seems a possible solution would be to make screen 2 the synergy Server ( and therefore screen 1). It seems like synergy intepretes the position in relation to the server.\nEDIT: You can create or edit the synergy configuration file, which has several sections. In the section 'links' you can edit the relativ position of the screens to each other (as in edges). You can find a guide how to do this at http://synergy2.sourceforge.net/configuration.html \nIf you replace host1 with the correct names it should something like that:\nsection: links\n   host1:\n            down = host 2\nhost2:\n            up = host1\nIf host1 is your primary screen it should switch to it, and for your other monitor you dont need synergy anyway.\n(Edited with my phone so sry for the formatting)\n", "Q: Ubuntu 12.10 dual boot 2 of the same versions I recently installed Ubuntu 12.10 on my PC since 12.04 felt super unstable this is a slight improvement.. any way when I start up my PC there are 2 Ubuntus in boot up that run the same OS nothing in difference, along with Windows Vista so there is something like this:\n*Windows Vista\n*Ubuntu  -\n           (Problem)\n*Ubuntu  -\n\nHow can I just have one Ubuntu and please don't tell me i need to have everything obliterated!

I managed it to work properly now I could use some keyboard shortcuts to start programs like gmrun, firefox or whatever.\n\nA: You can add keyboard shortcuts by editing ~/.config/awesome/rc.lua.\nopen rc.lua in your favorite editor:\nvim ~/.config/awesome/rc.lua\n\nand to run firefox with Super+Shift+w add the following  line:\nawful.key({ modkey, \"Shift\" }, \"w\", function () awful.util.spawn(\"firefox\") end)\n\nmodkey is usually Super key that can be changed in rc.lua. Replace \"firefox\" with whatever program or command you want to run. Before defining your own keybindings checkout for predefined keybindings in rc.lua to avoid conflicts.\nAnother example: dmrun with Supre+r:\nawful.key({ modkey, }, \"r\", function () awful.util.spawn(\"dmrun\") end)\n\nAfter making changes to rc.lua its important to check configuration file for errors by running the following command:\nawesome -k\n\nYou should see something like this:\n✔ Configuration file syntax OK\n\n\nA: On Ubuntu 14.04.1 LTS, using Awesome version v3.4.15, (you can check version with command line: awesome -v)\nCopying the configuration file to your home dir (file: rc.lua)\nIf you haven't yet copied the config files from system to your home directory, you can do that with\nmkdir ~/.config/\nmkdir ~/.config/awesome/\ncp -r /etc/xdg/awesome/rc.lua ~/.config/awesome/\n\nTo copy the default themes as well, so you can change them for user level, do:\ncp -r /usr/share/awesome/themes/ ~/.config/awesome\n\nThen, you can edit rc.lua using your favourite editor, for example\nvim ~/.config/awesome/rc.lua\n\nEditing rc.lua\nFind the text in the file\n-- {{{ Key bindings\nglobalkeys = awful.util.table.join(\n\nBelow this you can add your custom commands, for example: \n-- {{{ Key bindings\nglobalkeys = awful.util.table.join(\n     -- My Bindings\n     awful.key({ }, \"F1\", function () awful.util.spawn_with_shell(\"terminator\") end),\n\nHere you can change the key which here is F1, or program which here is terminator.\nIf you want to add composite keys, put them inside { }, for example:\n-- {{{ Key bindings\nglobalkeys = awful.util.table.join(\n     -- My Bindings\n     awful.key({ modkey, \"Control\" }, \"F1\", function () awful.util.spawn_with_shell(\"terminator\") end),\n\nThis would bind keys Super + Control + F1 to open terminator. modkey is a variable set in rc.lua, then it doesn't need (can't) to be escaped. It defaults for Superkey.\nYou can also put your keybindings at the end of globalkeys (after all the default keybindings), but if you do, make sure you avoid the ending comma , in the last keybinding, and add a closing comma to the last binding just before the last one, example:\n-- {{{ Key bindings\nglobalkeys = awful.util.table.join(\n   -- LOTS of stuff after:\n     awful.key({ modkey }, \"x\",\n               function ()\n                   awful.prompt.run({ prompt = \"Run Lua code: \" },\n                   mypromptbox[mouse.screen].widget,\n                   awful.util.eval, nil,\n                   awful.util.getdir(\"cache\") .. \"/history_eval\")\n               end),\n     -- My Bindings\n     awful.key({ }, \"F1\", function () awful.util.spawn_with_shell(\"terminator\") end)\n)\n\nPay attention to the last binding (the one that I created for F1); it has no ending comma, and the one before the last has a comma.\nThen you can reload the configuration (default keys: Ctrl + Super + r) and see if the new configuration is working. When the user configuration rc.lua fails, Awesome loads the main one from the system. Otherwise, you can check the configuration file via terminal, with awesome -k.\nSorry if this was confusing. If anything is unclear just tell me and I can try to improve.\n", "Q: NVM Command Not Found Issue Attempted to add to this question: NVM Command Not Found, however wasn't able to. \nAfter installing nvm im having the same issue, here is the log from terminal:\nMichael-iMac:~ michaels_imac$ curl https://raw.github.com/creationix/nvm/master/install.sh | sh\n  % Total    % Received % Xferd  Average Speed   Time    Time     Time  Current\n                                 Dload  Upload   Total   Spent    Left  Speed\n100  1202  100  1202    0     0   5759      0 --:--:-- --:--:-- --:--:--  6829\n=> NVM is already installed in /Users/michaels_imac/.nvm, trying to update\n=>  \nAlready up-to-date.\n\nMichaels-iMac:~ michaels_imac$ nvm install 0.8\n\n-bash: nvm: command not found\n\n\nA: The problem seems to be that gnome terminal does not load ~/.profile on startup, and there is where NVM is added to the path.

It is not on the DVD-r that I put Ubuntu live on. It also appears that someone is manipulating the info and tweaking my live session. How is this possible?\n\nA: Magic!\nMore seriously, a few things - firstly that the filesystem on the disk is compressed with squashfs, any changes are temporarily stored in a ramdisk, and lost when you reboot.

Is it possible to reserve (at least so much bandwidth) or limit (no more than so much bandwidth) the network usage of certain processes or applications.  Alternatively, reserve/limit the network usage of an/some user(s) and or groups?\nI'm interested in...:  Limiting the bandwidth of specific process (PID).  Limiting the bandwidth of each process by a certain name (e.g. each instance of rtorrent could not use more than 20kb/s, but five instances could thus use 100kb/s).  Limiting the usage of all instances of program (e.g. all instances of rtrorrent could use no more than 50kb/s).

I have two coumputers sharing on Internet-connection, and sometimes one takes all the bandwidth.  On the other hand, sometimes one computer uses non or very little bandwidth, so then the other obviously should be able to take all there is.

I will be using the system mainly at home for personal use, I will be connecting to Internet for mail, chat and surfing.\n\nA: In general I would advice to update and if you can not for whatever reason to try to keep up with at least the security updates.

If I mount a drive using the file manager (I'm using PCManFM), the mount point is automatically removed when I run the umount command. However, if I mount by running mkdir and then mount, I have to manually remove the mount point after I have run umount.\nWhy does this happen? Is there a way to mount the drive using the mount command that will make the mount point be automatically removed?\nUpdate: Is it similar to the reason for this?\n\nA: It is not up to umount to delete a directory so from command line you need to do it yourself.\nYou can use a script for that:\n#!/bin/bash\nmount_point=/media/directory\numount $mount_point && rmdir $mount_point &\n\nand save it as umount.sh.\nThe mount_point might be better off as a variable so you could so \n./umount.sh /media/dir\n\nSomething like this\n#!/bin/bash\nmount_point=$1\numount $mount_point && rmdir $mount_point &\n\n\nSo why is it automatically removed when I run umount on a drive that has been mounted with a GUI file manager?\n\nThe answer to this is more likely a design decision.

The output can be found here:\nhttp://paste.ubuntu.com/5689718/\nHope you can help me.\n\nA: Your Boot Repair output shows a GRUB configuration for Windows as on a BIOS-based computer, but you seem to be running in EFI mode. That's the root source of your problem. One solution is to create a manual GRUB stanza, like this:\nmenuentry \"Windows 8\" {\n    insmod part_gpt\n    insmod chain\n    set root='(hd0,gpt2)'\n    chainloader /EFI/Microsoft/Boot/bootmgfw.efi\n}\n\nYou can place this directly in your /boot/grub/grub.cfg file, but it will be temporary. A better long-term solution is to put that in /etc/grub.d/40_custom and then run update-grub. This will create a new entry that will (perhaps) work.\nOne complication is that you seem to be using Secure Boot. I'm not sure about the version of GRUB that ships with Ubuntu 12.04 (presumably 12.04.2, actually), but some versions of GRUB have problems launching Windows in EFI mode with Secure Boot active. Thus, the preceding solution might not work unless you disable Secure Boot. You'll need to rummage about in your firmware settings to find how to disable Secure Boot; the details vary greatly from one computer to another. Even then, launching Windows from GRUB seems to be hit-or-miss; what works on one computer fails on another.\nAn entirely different option is to install rEFInd, which supplements or replaces GRUB. This also might require you to disable Secure Boot; and if you don't, you'll need to enroll rEFInd's key the first time you reboot; see rEFInd's Secure Boot documentation for details. (I'm assuming that Ubuntu 12.04.2 has an updated version of shim that supports MOKs. If it doesn't, Secure Boot becomes even trickier, since you'll need to install a new version of shim.) Ideally, though, simply installing the rEFInd Debian package should get things working correctly, especially if you first disable Secure Boot.\n", "Q: Looking for a screen monitoring program for a high school computer lab As the title says, I'm looking for a screen monitoring program for a high school computer lab that works with either Mint 14 or Lubuntu 12.04.

I managed to get my Ubuntu laptop to do wifi printing at the university in Australia where I study, I was told that only windows using only Internet Explorer can print (not even Mac) as they have a web interface that you use to select the available printer and then it installs the printer network settings etc through Internet Explorer.\nWell, I managed to use the add printer GUI to search their printer hosting server for available printers after it prompted me to login using SAMBA when I entered the server site name (without HTTPS), the list came up and I selected the printer I needed.  I then went through the list to pick the model etc which I got from the printer's network path as its name was the model number.  Its a Ricoh Aficio MP C3300\nThis printer needs a user code unique to each person printing, the PPD file gives the settings GUI standard 4 digit user codes like 1001, 1002, 1003 etc, I had to hard code my extra code into the PPD file to choose it from the GUI. There is a CustomUserCode or similar in the PPD file, surely the printer settings gui can be modified for one to set your own unique user code?  I have emailed the University's library with all instructions I used to get this working and I let them know it may work for Macs so at least that should get them to look into it as Macs are becoming quite popular.\n\nA: It misses some information that should result useful. Nevertheless I see 3 family of  solutions:\n\n\n*\n\n*You can install a Virtual Machine (Virtualbox) on your Ubuntu with a  working  Windows operative system, install the printer following the usual procedure from your university and after share the printer with your computer. There are many tutorial about different version of Windows. The advantage is that you can fully use the normal procedure. You emulate a machine (hardware) and not the operative system. If the Virtual Machine is up you can download a pre-made system too. Follow, e.g., this post to have other news about it.\n\n*You can try to install the driver through wine. I see more problems because this time you go to emulate the system and explorer have to connect with a probably dedicated interface and install the driver in the emulated system. So it seems to be a specific task and I don't know how much it can be tested. This doesn't mean it cannot function. \n\n*From another computer with installed that printer you can obtain the IP address and the other parameters you should need. Else, since you have the authorization to print, at least you have the possibility to put physically your hands on the printer: from the panel option on the printer you may see the IP address. Often in the universities this can be even more easy: the IP can be directly written on the printer, or on the network plug.  \n\n\n*\n\n*If it is a fixed IP, you can try to install in Ubuntu the printer as a network one. Via CUPS. With those parameter\nDriver: Ricoh Aficio yyy foomatic/plx mono (reccomanded)  yyy is your model or one compatible\nConnection soket://xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx (the IP you read before)\nFixing by hands the parameter for Media source, double side printing, quality  and so on...  \n\n*If it is a DHCP printer it should be more tricky. With Samba you can discover the printer in the network and after you should obtain a connection like\nConnection dnssd://RICOH%20Aficio%ZZZZZZZZ_pdl-datastream._tcp.local/ instead of \"ZZZZZZZZ\" there will be your model/id of printer.\n\n\n\nThe latter way is possible only if the administrators did not close the printer with a firewall, or did not set the printer to accept jobs only from their queue.\nNote. Once that you obtain the IP of your printer you can probably enter in the internet page of your printer (!). http(s)://xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx always the same IP of before. (I don't remember if it is encrypted or not, http or https). It's even possible that you can download from there the driver too.  \nGeneral consideration: IMO it's impolite, even if not unusual, that a University forces the use of a proprietary software to access a shared resource. \nAdditional References  \n\n\n*\n\n*Create a virtual machine and install a guest operating system\n\nA: Wow, that's definitely a lot of information, but I would recommend installing Wine from http://winehq.com/ and installing Internet Explorer. Internet explorer will function properly and when it installs the printer stuff, Wine will take care of the settings and drivers and SAMBA should be able to function with these. If not SAMBA, Ubuntu itself, but Wine will be able to take care of that. Comment for questions.\n", "Q: Why .profile (and not .bashrc) appends ~/bin to path? Since .bashrc is more \"generic\" (in the sense that .profile sources it), why \"include ~/bin to path\" procedure is not inside .bashrc? Why the user would not want it in a non-login shell? (Especially nowadays, where non-login shells are more common*.)\nI know I can manually do such change, but I want to know if there is a reason.\n*can't prove it, but I think that is the case.\n\nA: It's because traditionally environment variables go only in /etc/profile or .profile. The bashrc file is for things like aliases, prompt settings, shell options and so forth (i.e. things that relate directly to the shell).\n\nA: ~/.bashrc and /etc/bash.bashrc are run every time an interactive bash shell is started.\nIn contrast, ~/.profile and /etc/profile are run every time any login shell is started. So it does not have to be a bash shell, but it does have to be a login shell (and many bash shell instances are not login shells).\n\n\n*\n\n*A bash shell is a shell where the shell program that provides it is bash, rather than some other program, such as dash.\n\n*A login shell is a shell that is started automatically as a consequence of logging in, to provide the user interface (graphical or command-line) for the login. When a login shell is exited, the login terminates.\n\n\nTherefore, putting a commend that appends entries to PATH in a bashrc file would:\n\n\n*\n\n*Do nothing when the shell is not bash, which is often the case. For example, PATH would be unmodified when you're in a graphical login session. Remember, PATH is not just used by command-line programs.\n\n*Append it over and over again in the presence of nested bash shells. So, if you start a shell within a shell--which is very common, for a variety of reasons--then you'll have multiple ~/bin entries stacked onto your PATH. This makes the PATH environment variable difficult to read, and sometimes also decreases performance.\nThese would be undesirable. Thus it would be wrong to put this in a bashrc file; it really belongs in ~/.profile. ~/.profile is the right place for:\n# set PATH so it includes user's private bin if it exists\nif [ -d \"$HOME/bin\" ] ; then\n    PATH=\"$HOME/bin:$PATH\"\nfi\n\nNon-login shells have login shells (or something that behaves like a login shell) as their parent, and inherit most of their environment variables, including PATH, from this login shell. So putting path-modifying commands in ~/.profile requires that you log out and back in for them to be effective, but it affects the environment of non-login shells too (as well as the environment for programs that are not shells, since every program gets its own set of environment variables--called its \"environment\"--inherited from its parent process).\n", "Q: How to remove orphaned files and residues I'm using 12.04 LTS. After uninstalling unwanted packages using purge and autoremove commands I still have orphaned files in system / home directory (configuration and cache files mostly). \nJust to make it clear used synaptic to clean the residual configurations, which removed the listed packages but some of the uninstalled package left various directories across system.\nIs there a way how to completely get rid of those unwanted files? \nI'm not fan of janitor and bleechbit type of software and consider it somehow dangerous, but do not want to bloat my system with files I do not need anymore. Used fslint which looks good for a duplicate  files but fails to find  residues and similar files.\nAny suggestions?\n\nA: Kinda embarrassing answering to my own question but found a solution how to remove orphaned packages that satisfies my needs.\nFirst I made a new custom filter in Synaptic package Manager.\nSettings -> Filters\nThan Deselected All and checked only Orphaned check box and  saved.\nNow synaptic is listing all orphaned files. Note that synaptic will list files with no dependencies as orphaned too so don't remove anything you're unsure what it is (and if it is really orphaned).\nThan I installed GtkOrphan using CLI sudo apt-get install gtkorphan which is a GUI for deborphan but adds option to remove packages too.\nOnce started GtkOrphan and has to be run as root, under Orphaned packages tab expand the Options and check the \"Show all orphan packages, not only those in the libs section\". After that GtkOrphan will report as \"orphaned\" all packages that have no dependencies too, for example libreoffice, ubuntu-desktop, ubuntu-restricted-extras, myunity and etc. Now you can check the list and using right-click context menu chose to hibernate each package you don't want to be reported as orphaned. List of hibernated packages can be accessed from right click context menu or View menu.\nAlways under Orphaned packages tab and expanded Options check the \"Show uninstalled packages with orphaned configuration files\". Before removing anything make sure you know what are the files you want to delete. In my case GtkOrphan found some old nautilus configuration files not shown in Synaptic Package Manager.\nIn case you delete some of configuration files you need re-installing the package should solve the problem.\n\nA: I had the same problem with some orphaned files, created after using rsync. A few hidden files starting .f were created on my external hard drive. Even a sudo rm would not remove them.\nUnmounting the drive, then re-mounting it allowed me to rename then delete the files.\nIf the orphaned files are on a system hard drive, I'd say boot into a live CD then delete the files.\n", "Q: wine install problem $ sudo apt-get install wine\n[sudo] password for hergul: \nReading package lists...

I need to block and actively reject mail which has no reverse DNS.  I am willing to accept that it's possible that some legit mail will be blocked, however, so far the only mail with no reverse DNS has been spam.\nBelow is the code for reverse DNS checking from the EXIM4 config.  How do I change this from warn to blocking.\n# Warn if the sender host does not have valid reverse DNS.\n  # \n  # If your system can do DNS lookups without delay or cost, you might want\n  # to enable this.\n  # If sender_host_address is defined, it's a remote call.

If you are denying you may want to do this in the recipient ACL after you accept postmaster and abuse addresses.  Watch which servers you reject, as some legitimate senders (airlines, banks, governments) have broken rDNS on their automated senders.\n# Verify reverse DNS lookup of the sender's host.\ndeny\n  message Reverse DNS verification failed\n  !verify = reverse_host_lookup\n  !hosts = ${if exists{CONFDIR/local_broken_dns_whitelist}\\\n                      {CONFDIR/local_broken_dns_whitelist} {}}\n\nI find a lot of spambots give up quickly if they don't get a connection banner quickly enough.  Including the following in a connect ACL may help.  Disabling pipelining catches a number of spambots that don't behave well.  If the delay is too long (over 30s) some legitimate servers will also give up. \n# Verify reverse DNS lookup of the sender's host.\n# Disable piplining and delay on failure.\nwarn\n  !hosts = ${if exists{CONFDIR/local_broken_dns_whitelist}\\\n                      {CONFDIR/local_broken_dns_whitelist} {}}\n  !verify = reverse_host_lookup\n  control = no_pipelining\n  delay = 10s\n\n\nA: The previous answer didn't work for me.\nBut I did get these two working:\n  deny message = Forged IP detected in HELO: $sender_helo_name\n    log_message = Forged IP detected in HELO: $sender_helo_name\n    condition = ${if eq{$sender_helo_name}{$interface_address}{yes}{no}}\n\n  deny\n    message = X-Host-Lookup-Failed: Reverse DNS lookup failed for $sender_host_address \\\n            (${if eq{$host_lookup_failed}{1}{failed}{deferred}})\n    log_message = X-Host-Lookup-Failed: Reverse DNS lookup failed for $sender_host_address\n    condition = ${if and{{def:sender_host_address}{!def:sender_host_name}}\\\n                      {yes}{no}}\n\nHope that helps.\n\nA: Why don't you use sieve, spamassassin or rspamd, and just use no-rdns as an extra value for spam-score, which is already in there by default? You just raise the score value for no-rDNS sources and you're done. Plus, you avoid the risk of completely rejecting valid email from a server that has just migrated or been launched on a new system. A proper rDNS is not always swiftly realized, you know, or forgotten for ipv6, while the core system is already using ipv6.

As some of you may know, RDP in Windows allows the client to make its drives available to the host or target machine. I have done that with no problems in the case of Windows-Windows and Linux-Windows (rdesktop), but I can't seem to find a way to do it for Windows-Linux. Am I missing something?\n\nA: ssh is better supported for remote file sharing, try with winscp from windows to connect to linux machine file system. \nYou must have installed ssh on server.\nYou can also try my answer from:\nRemote desktop for multiple users \nTo have full support with x2go, I have tried it and works very well for lot of features with remote desktop.\n\nA: While it isn't xrdp, ThinLinc allows you to share local drives to the server. It could be worth a try if you can't get xrdp working!\n(full disclosure: I'm a ThinLinc dev)\n\nA: You can achieve drive redirection with xRDP solution.  xRDP allows you to use your windows remote desktop client and to remotely connect to your Ubuntu computer.  xRDP needs to be installed on the Linux machine. So, xRDP software is the equivalent of Remote Desktop in Linux.  \nxRDP package from Ubuntu repository does not provide drive redirection. To have drive redirection, you will need to compile the xrdp binaries... The drive redirection seems to be supported in xRDP version 0.6 or later (if you compile the xRDP package)\nYou can view a quick demo of drive redirection with xRDP here\nThe following link provides a scripted custom installation of xRDP. This script will compile the xRDP with the necessary switch to include drive redirection feature in xRDP. \nhope this is helpful \n", "Q: Can not access windows 8 drive from Ubuntu I am dual booting Windows 8 and Ubuntu ...i finally got them both working\nmy problem is i can not see my windows drive from ubuntu ....i can see it listed with i open up nautilus  ...but when i click on on it i get an error and can not read it\nhow do i fix this ....what did i do wrong in my install that would give me a mounting error\nI have another dual boot machine and that machine mounted the windows drive automatically\n\nA: When you turn off the computer using Windows 8, the system actually hibernate, and the windows partition is marked as being used.

When I set custom folder icons in Ubuntu 13.04, gray boxes appear around them:\n\nHow can I make the icons just look normal?\n\nA: It's not a bug. In Nautilus 3.6.3 (the version in Ubuntu 13.04) every custom icon gets a frame \"to make it consistent with the appearance of thumbnails.\"\nThat's what I read in the changelog on Launchpad (search for 2012-08-31, and you wil read it too.)\nThe 64x64 bits PNG-image that draws that frame, is included in the source code package. \nIt's the thumbnail_frame.png in the /icons directory\nSOLUTION(1): in the source-code, replace that thumnail_frame.png with another picture, and recompile the program. \nSOLUTION(2): Hack the nautilus-ui-utilies.c file, starting at codeline 192\nvoid\nnautilus_ui_frame_image (GdkPixbuf **pixbuf)\n{\nGdkPixbuf *pixbuf_with_frame, *frame;\nint left_offset, top_offset, right_offset, bottom_offset;\n\n/*  frame = nautilus_get_thumbnail_frame (); */\n    frame = NULL;\nif (frame == NULL) {\n    return;\n}\n\nleft_offset = NAUTILUS_THUMBNAIL_FRAME_LEFT;\ntop_offset = NAUTILUS_THUMBNAIL_FRAME_TOP;\nright_offset = NAUTILUS_THUMBNAIL_FRAME_RIGHT;\nbottom_offset = NAUTILUS_THUMBNAIL_FRAME_BOTTOM;\n\npixbuf_with_frame = eel_embed_image_in_frame\n    (*pixbuf, frame,\n     left_offset, top_offset, right_offset, bottom_offset);\ng_object_unref (*pixbuf);\n\n*pixbuf = pixbuf_with_frame;\n}\n\nSo with this hack the nautilus_ui_frame_image function returns without putting a frame :-) \n\nA: If you are like me that rarely have lucky compiling things by yourself, you may want something already compiled.  \nNemo is a fork of Nautilus 3.4   \nYou can install it with the Cinnamon ppa:  \nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:gwendal-lebihan-dev/cinnamon-stable; sudo apt-get update; sudo apt-get install nemo nemo-fileroller  \n\nIt looks like this:  \n\nRegards ;-)   \n\nA: While this is not a solution to this particular problem (I wasn't able to find one myself), you can work around it by not using folders with custom icons, but rather desktop files that are links to alternate locations (e.g. a hidden folder in your home directory).\nTheir icon will be shown without a border.\nExample: link.desktop\n[Desktop Entry]\nType=Link\nName=MyFolder\nURL=file:///home/<username>/.hidden_folder/\nIcon=/path/to/icon.svg\n\n", "Q: How do I upload a .css file to launchpad I am trying to upload a framework.css file to launchpad with the following command: \ndput ppa:blade19899/framework.css framework.css_2.0_source.changes\n\nbut according to this answer source.changes file is a file generated by debuild -S.\nMy question is: How do I upload a non debian file(a .css file) to launchpad?\n\nA: You cannot upload individual files such as that to Launchpad PPAs.\nYou must create a deb source package to upload to a PPA. If all you have is a single CSS file, you probably don't want to package it and manage a PPA. You can instead use the Create a release link on the page for your project, and add it as a download file there.\n\nA: You can upload individual files to launchpad if you are using bzr and you run a commit without building a package.  @Dobey is mostly right though.

Is there a way to use that PID to find the name of the process that's stopping it?\n\nA: If PID 31340, a simple ps uww 31340 will tell you. ls -l /proc/31340 will show you more information, for example /proc/31340/exe is a symbolic link to the program executable in case the name wasn't enough.\nIf PID 31340 isn't running anymore, it's too late unless you've installed some kind of logging software.\nThe simplest logging software for this job is acct . Just install the package and it will start logging the name of all processes. The next time you want to know about some past PID, run\nsudo dump-acct /var/log/account/pacct | grep 31340\n\nFor a more precise match of the last process that had this PID, you can use this incantation:\nsudo dump-acct /var/log/account/pacct | awk -F '|' '$10 ~ /^ *31340 / {print; quit}'\n\n", "Q: how to set up sublime text 2 as environment variable sublime I just installed sublime text 2 on Ubuntu 12.10 and would like to be able to run it as its own environment variable.

Suggested place to extract the downloaded file to is /opt.\n\nA: I am not sure this is the most elegant solution but you can create a script in your ~/bin/sublime with the following commands:\ncd\necho \"/FULL-PATH-TO-YOUR-SUBLIME-FOLDER/sublime_text \\$1\" > ~/bin/sublime\nchmod +x ~/bin/sublime\n\nand then if your ~/bin/ folder is in your $PATH then you will be able to run $ sublime somefile.js\nTo check your $PATH just run echo $PATH\nIf you bin is not ther edit your .bashrc file and edit or add a line like the following:\nPATH=$PATH:$HOME/bin\nexport PATH\n\n\nA: This is the BEST way, I think!\ngo to your terminal and type:\nsudo ln -s /opt/Sublime\\ Text\\ 2/sublime_text /usr/bin/sublime\n(if your sublime text folder is in /opt/Sublime Text 2)\nthis command creates a symbolic link in /usr/bin and then you can call sublime command easily in terminal:\nsublime ....

They are useful in many situations, and can turn code to much more succinct and compact. They also facilitate quick composition of more complex constructs via command expansion.\nHere's an example: I have a program which operates on multiple host arguments. I need to generate a list of host names which have a sequential number embedded in them, e.g:\na1z a2z a3z a4z a5z\n\nIn bash one can write:\n$ progname a{1..5}z\n\nwhich will expand to:\n$ progname a1z a2z a3z a4z a5z\n\nIn tcsh, which lacks this useful argument vector-generation feature, we can sometimes use seq.  Unfortunately, seq is limited to numbers only. man seq says that seq supports a --format argument, but it doesn't seem to do the really useful thing (allowing arbitrary formats including a number).  Instead it only supports changing the floating-point format of a number alone (a pity).\nOf course, we can delegate the expansion to bash + echo using both command expansion and quoting of the full bash -c argument:\ntcsh> progname `bash -c \"echo a{1..5}z\"`\n\nSimilarly, we could delegate the string vector generation to big utilities like awk, perl, python, lisp, or R using `` (command expansion).\nThe question is: are there any other simple ways to generate such vectors in tcsh. By 'simple' I mean a small utility like seq, or even better, a built-in shell construct, and without resorting to writing loops or delegating the vector generation to \"big\" programs like bash/awk/clisp/perl/python/R?\n\nA: You can pipe the output of seq.\nprogname `seq 5 | sed -e 's/^/a/' -e 's/$/z/'`\n\nYou can use history substitution to add a prefix to all the elements of an array:\nset a = (`seq 5`)\nprogname ${a:s//a/}\n\nI don't know how to add a suffix, but I'm not a tcsh expert.\n\nTcsh is kind of dead this century, and even before was widely recognized as less suitable for scripting than Bourne-style shells.

Here is an image:\n\nThe microphone started at 100% and slowly started to drop to where the image is showing. This is because of either a background noise or the user raising their voice. In any case, I would like to prohibit this behavior because when it gets too low, the need to raise the voice will be actually needed.\nSo is there an option or configuration file where one can edit and change this behavior?\nThis is not related to only one app but several, ranging from Skype to Google Hangouts, Empathy to Teamspeak and more. So please no answers mentioning only one app if the solution does not solve the problem for others.\nthe pulseaudio app (gui and terminal) was already used. Alsamixer was also used. In both cases, adjusting the microphone level did not help. The auto adjust always happens when anyone speaks, does not even need to be someone speaking loud, they just need to speak and after a couple of seconds the mic level will start auto adjusting. I repeat, this is not a 1 app problem but several, so a common solution is better than a 1 for each app (Which we are talking about more than 50 apps).\n\nA: I am still working on this annoying issue (An option should be included on the Input Devices tab to \"Force\" the input volume to stay where the user wants to set it. This would apply for specific cases where the user knows what volume it needs for a particular app and the auto adjust features does not work correctly for it. Anyway, to set it to \"semi-manual\" mode instead of auto adjust for Google Apps like Hangouts, created/edit the file options in:\nnano ~/.config/google-googletalkplugin/options\n\nand add the line:\naudio-flags=1\n\nor simply run the following line:\necho \"audio-flags=1\" > ~/.config/google-googletalkplugin/options\n\nSave the file and close any Google related apps. The volume for the input device should stop auto adjusting. This works 50/50 this is why I am looking for a permanent solution.\n\nA: I fixed the issue on my machine by disabling any other mics on my desktop. I found if the camera mic picked up audio, it dropped the gain on the headset. I disabled the camera mic and the headset is steady now.\nNot sure if it helps, but thought it worth mentioning.\n\nA: Not sure if this applies to everyone, but if you use any kind of web conference / video chat service in Chrome / Chromium such as Google Hangouts, there's a good chance it uses the WebRTC protocol.  Unfortunately the WebRTC implementation in Chromium comes with a handy “feature” called Automatic Gain Control that tends to screw with your microphone volume.  Unless the web app itself gives you an option to disable it, there is otherwise no way turn it off, and Chrome developers don't want to add a global “off switch” for it.\nWhat I ended up doing was to use @lelandbatey's solution.  Since I was using PulseAudio, I used pacmd instead of amixer:\nwhile sleep 0.1; do pacmd set-source-volume alsa_input.???-?????.analog-stereo 90000; done\n\nNote that 65535 corresponds to 100%, so 90000 is about 135%.  The name of the device (alsa_input.???-?????.analog-stereo) should be substituted with whatever you find by running pacmd list-sources | grep name::\nname: <alsa_input.???-?????.analog-stereo>\n\n\nA: I had this problem, but with every type of video chat that I attempted to use on Xubuntu, everything from Google Hangouts to appr.tc would auto adjust my microphone volume. In particular, it seems to boost the volume if any voices can be heard in the background, as if to try to make the quietest voice be heard.\nAnyway, my fix was to manually set my microphone volume with a command line directive, put into a while loop and running every tenth of a second.

At the moment it's using less than 7 Megabytes of RAM total across all its processes.\nFor spam filtering, I'd recommend either spamassassin or rspamd. Rspamd is lighter IMHO, but it requires a little bit of tweaking to get it working right (it doesn't add extra mail headers by default - you have to configure it to do that so you can filter the messages with a sieve rule).\nSpamassassin is great too, but I found it ate rather a lot of resources.\nI've heard that ClamAV is rather resource heavy, but I've no personal experience there.\nRoundcube is good, but you might also want to take a look at Rainloop, though it may be for personal use only.\nDB integration isn't really needed for small installations I don't think.

The windows computer is plugged into the modem and gets it's internet from that, but my laptop gets it wirelessly, which is the problem. Here's a little back story: I had windows 7 installed not even 5 days ago and the wireless was working fine. The only time my laptop didn't have internet was when the other computer wasn't getting it either (which was rare). But after installing ubuntu (before and after tinkering (adding drivers, gnome shell, my apps, etc.)), it cuts in and out every few minutes; though it can last a while, it isn't predictable. I've looked up ways to fix it and none seem feasible to me, though it could just be my inexperience with this sort of thing. If specs are needed, I'm gonna need someone to tell me how, as that's how little I know about this. Any help would be appreciated at this point, I really don't want to go back to windows but right now it looks like it's the only option. I'll wait a while for replies but if I can't fix it soon I may need to stop trying to use ubuntu altogether. Any help is appreciated.

I am not sure about Ubuntu.\nSo my question is: Is there a Ubuntu SDK that supports all features of a x86 tablet? I am not interested in ARM tablets.\nThx for answering! \n\nA: Ubuntu touch is not yet available for x86, But you can expect it in near future\n", "Q: WUBI doesn't work with 32 bit windows Well as the title says I can't use Wubi with 32 bit windows, it produces an error.

This netbook has an Nvidia Ion GPU, which I had to install Mtrons scripts in order to use (located here: https://sites.google.com/site/mtrons/howtos/eeepc-1015pn). These worked great at first and I much prefer the Nvidia mode for Steam and Minecraft and other gaming.\nHowever today I tested out the Intel mode and it also works great. But I restarted in order to go back to the Nvidia mode and it doesn't boot to the window manager, instead it just drops me into tty1. The only way I can get to a GUI is by using the Intel mode and now I'm basically stuck in Intel mode. I tried restarting many times and also have tried the commands from Mtron's script such as sudo display-settings auto and sudo display_settings fix and also sudo display-settings config-nvidia. None of those worked. I can't seem to get to the GUI. I would appreciate some advice if anyone has encountered this problem. Thank you very much.\n\nA: This should have been a bugreport and not a question suitable for this site but well, here we are ;) Next time, use the integrated \"report a bug\" wizard in the gui. So we can make sure bug reports reach me.\nThis bug happened because the driver naming schema for the nvidia binary driver package changed from 'nvidia-current' to nvidia-< first 3 digits of driver version>.

A tool for checking backward binary\n  compatibility of a shared C/C++ library. It analyzes changes in API\n  that may cause compatibility problems: changes in call stack, v-table\n  changes, removed interfaces, etc.\nAutonet.  Autonet is a GUI network test platform, internally it's\n  based on CLI to communicate with devices. It can help you to arrange\n  test cases, setup commands to devices ,run commands to check results\n  and record test results.\nDoit: Simple Web Application Testing.  Doit is a scripting tool and\n  language for testing web applications that use forms. Doit can\n  generate random or sequenced form fill-in information, report results\n  (into a database, file, or stdout), filter HTML results, and compare\n  results to previous results, without having to manually use a web\n  browser. It uses a console-based web client tool (like Curl or Wget)\n  to send and receive HTTP requests and responses respectively.\nPETA.  Eclipse-based platform for automated software testing and\n  covers the software life cycle from the specification up to the\n  maintenance phase. The components of message based software systems\n  like Client-/Server-, Multitier- and Service-Oriented-Architectures\n  (SOA) may be simulated as well as tested in isolation and in their\n  supposed interaction.\n\nAnd others too many to list.

I've installed lubuntu 12.10 AMD64 on my system, placing / and /boot on an SSD and the rest on a hard disk. Everything except /boot is encrypted. All was well until the SSD started producing I/O errors. It appears I'm going to have to return it for replacement, which means being without it for a few weeks.\nAs a substitute I copied everything from / and /boot onto an SD card, installed grub on it (grub-install /dev/sdf), and figured I could use the SD card as my boot disk until the replacement SSD arrives. However, Grub doesn't seem to agree - once the SSD is disconnected and the system powered on again, Grub boots from the SD card, but only says:\nerror: no such device: 5ab2e581-some-guid.\ngrub rescue>\n\nI don't recognize that GUID it's complaining about - it's not in grub.cfg, grubenv, or any other text files I found in /boot, and sudo blkid doesn't show it.\nPiecing together what information I could find about this prompt I came up with the following set of commands that seemed like they should be able to boot the kernel manually from here:\nset root=(hd0,msdos1)/boot\nset prefix=(hd0,msdos1)/boot/grub\ninsmod linux\nlinux (hd0,msdos1)/boot/vmlinuz-3.5.0-26-generic root=/dev/sde1 rootdelay=5\nboot\n\nbut the kernel doesn't seem to notice the SD card, and fails saying I need to provide an appropriate root= parameter and giving a list of available partitions - except the list is empty.\nIf, on the other hand, I do:\nset root=(hd0,msdos1)/boot\nset prefix=(hd0,msdos1)/boot/grub\ninsmod linux\nlinux (hd0,msdos1)/boot/vmlinuz-3.5.0-26-generic\ninitrd (hd0,msdos1)/boot/initrd.img-3.5.0-26-generic\nboot\n\nit boots into an initrd image where I can see my SD card (on /dev/sde1, not /dev/sdf1, which is where I got sde1 in the above commands), but it doesn't appear there's any way to boot it from here either.\nI don't know what I've missed here - what is this unknown GUID grub is looking for, and why isn't it able to find and boot the kernel on the SD card?\n\nA: Well, I did manage to get this working, in a way... I gave up trying to fix grub on the SD card and installed a brand new lubuntu install on it, then copied everything from the old system's root over it. The main issue was having to edit /etc/fstab and /etc/crypttab to deal with different GUIDs and device paths. (Since /dev/sda was removed, everything got shifted up a letter.) After doing that, it runs at least, though I suspect some things didn't mesh entirely nicely, as I get a lot of errors from .bashrc (or somewhere?) when opening a terminal now... but things seem to be working, anyway.\n", "Q: Grub \"quiet splash\" + linux-image-3.2.0-40-generic + full disk encryption = boot failure From this morning the boot process on my laptop is no longer working.

Which version do you use? You can see the exact version when starting the mysql client. Next question, what storage engine do you use? And finally what are the settings in /etc/mysql/my.cnf? Usually with the default settings the server is not configured for serious use. You need to configure the server according to the needs of your application to have it running fast. BTW I have a similar machine i7, 8 Gb RAM, Ubuntu 12.04 LTS and it works perfectly. \nAs you said opening the file in gedit or kate are also slow could indicate an io bottleneck. \next3 is not recommended for MySQL. Either use ext2 or even better XFS. ext3 is known to be slow with MySQL.\n", "Q: Unable to securely remove: upgrade about libssl-doc  The following packages will be REMOVED:\n   libssl-doc\n The following packages have been kept back:\n   nodejs nodejs-dev\n 0 upgraded, 0 newly installed, 1 to remove and 2 not upgraded.\n 1 not fully installed or removed.\n After this operation, 1459 kB disk space will be freed.\n (Reading database ... 27911 files and directories currently installed.)\n Removing libssl-doc ...\n dpkg: error processing libssl-doc (--remove):\n  unable to securely remove '/usr/share/man/man3/SSL_set_session_id_context.3ssl.gz.dpkg-new': No such file or directory\n No apport report written because the error message indicates an issue on the local system\n Errors were encountered while processing:\n  libssl-doc\n E: Sub-process /usr/bin/dpkg returned an error code (1)\n\n\nWhile useing apt-get upgrade I got this ERROR message?\nI want to fix it but don't know how to do.\nDoes anyone know could help me to pass this issue? ><\n\nA: Me again!\nFinally find the answer!\nI rename the directory of /usr/share/man/man3 to /usr/share/man/man3.original.\nAnd apt-get upgrade again.\nThis problem are magically solved!!!!\n", "Q: Can't get second GPU recognized I just stuck in another GPU to run two screens.\n$ lspci | grep VGA\n02:00.0 VGA compatible controller: NVIDIA Corporation G86 [GeForce 8500 GT] (rev a1)\n03:00.0 VGA compatible controller: NVIDIA Corporation GT218 [GeForce 210] (rev a2)\n\nbut running xrandr I only see the first one:\n$ xrandr\nScreen 0: minimum 8 x 8, current 1920 x 1200, maximum 8192 x 8192\nDVI-I-0 disconnected (normal left inverted right x axis y axis)\nVGA-0 disconnected (normal left inverted right x axis y axis)\nTV-0 disconnected (normal left inverted right x axis y axis)\nDVI-I-1 connected 1920x1200+0+0 (normal left inverted right x axis y axis) 518mm x 324mm\n   1920x1200      60.0*+\n   1680x1050      60.0  \n   1600x1200      60.0  \n   1440x900       75.0     59.9  \n   1280x1024      75.0     60.0  \n   1280x800       74.9     59.8  \n   1024x768       75.0     60.0  \n   800x600        75.0     60.3  \n   640x480        75.0     59.9  \n\nAnd running gksudo nvidia-settings I only see the one GPU.\nI found something about enabling two GPUs in the nvidia drivers so I tried this:\n$ sudo nvidia-xconfig -a\n\nUsing X configuration file: \"/etc/X11/xorg.conf\".\nNVIDIA: could not open the device file /dev/nvidia1 (Input/output error).\n\nWARNING: Unable to use the nvidia-cfg library to query NVIDIA hardware.\n\n\nERROR: Unable to determine number of GPUs in system; cannot honor '--enable-all-gpus' option.\n\nBacked up file '/etc/X11/xorg.conf' as '/etc/X11/xorg.conf.backup'\nNew X configuration file written to '/etc/X11/xorg.conf'\n\nAny help highly appreciated!\n\nA: You should use a modified xorg.conf, where you insert your two GPUs as \"Section \"Device\" \"  and then bind the Displays via \"Section \"Monitor\"\" and \"Section \"Screen\"\" to the different GPUs. For further information i recommend this article ( https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/xorg_multiseat ) which should work for Ubuntu as well, you just need to change the Section \"Input\" so you don't get a 'real' multi seat.

Does anyone know a fix?\n\nA: Having used any version of Ubuntu I had always resume/suspend issue. But it can depends on diffrenent kind of video card. So If you have hybrid nvidea + intel video card please do the next:\n\n\n*\n\n*Next you need switch in BIOS on only use Intel video card or read the topic about HybridGraphics\n\n*Last thing is using small but working hack with switching graphic mode when laptop suspends and back after it resumes.\n\n*To solve problem with brighness control you need use the manual (compizomania.blogspot.com/2014/06/ubuntu-1404linux-mint-17.html)\n\n\nIf you do not use hybrid or optimal video card you are luckier and only one step that you need to do to install proprietary drivers (nvidia (www.binarytides.com/install-nvidia-drivers-ubuntu-14-04), fglrx (help.ubuntu.com/community/BinaryDriverHowto/AMD))\n\nA: I agree with Donarsson. The command iw does deal with wireless devices. Try (as suggested by Donarsson) disabling wireless before suspending. If resume works without issues, confirming the diagnosis, then you can check out the following page to automate unloading before suspend and loading after resume: https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/pm-utils#Standby.2Fsuspend_to_RAM\nBasically, you need the line SUSPEND_MODULES=\"mod1 mod2 mod3...\"to the file /etc/pm/config.d/modules where mod1, mod2, mod3... are the misbehaving modules to be unloaded/loaded.\nThe list of all modules (wireless and others) can be seen by running the command lsmod. I'm not completely sure how to find out which of these are to be added to SUSPEND_MODULES. Common wireless modules are ath5k, ath9k, iwlwifi and some realtek drivers beginning with r8. \n\nA: The problem is your WLAN card, it seems to sometimes not suspend/wake up properly (or not in time), which causes this error. I had a similar issue a while back, it fixed itself after some time (probably some minor update) and I haven't found any helpful documentation about this kind of error.\nBut a good workaround for me was to disable WiFi (via the network indicator) before suspending an enable it after waking up, it should fix the problem.\n", "Q: trouble accessing www folders - permission or ownership?

This is set in the config file for apache. \n$ grep wwww-data /etc/apache2\nenvvars:export APACHE_RUN_USER=www-data\nenvvars:export APACHE_RUN_GROUP=www-data\n\nThe Apache user/group should only have read access to the files in the web root so keep them as they are.\nYou should create a new group (something like www-admin) that has write access to those files and then add yourself to that group instead.\nusermod -a -G www andy\n\n\nA: www-data is the user used by apache2 webserver. as normal user you cannot do anything there, as you have no rights (the last --- mean that every user that is not www-data or in the same group has no rights). \nYou need to access it as root.\nSo do sudo su to permanently be root (this session) or sudo in front of every command\nEDIT: Damn, a few seconds too late. Other way works too\n", "Q: apt-get install - - fix-broken killed everything Ubuntu 12.04\nAfter an update, I got a red warning icon in the system tray saying something about dependency issues due to: Error: Broken Count > 0.\nI googled it and found the following thread:\nBroken package after update: linux-headers, error broken count >0\nThe guy there had the same issue and he could fix it using the command:\nsudo apt-get install --fix-broken\nSo I did the same without thinking too much and the result was that seemingly every last program was removed from the system. Then I restarted my machine (quite stupid) and now I don't even get to the login screen.\nIs there anything I can do besides reinstalling Ubuntu?\n\nA: As you can access a terminal, if you have internet access you can try to install the Ubuntu desktop:\nsudo apt-get install ubuntu-desktop\n\nThis should install all the default applications that are present in a fresh install. If that doesn't work you can use dpkg to get the list of the installed software and get the same list on a LiveCD, and install all the missing packages manually. To get the list use:\ndpkg --get-selections > package_list.txt\n\nBefore trying anything, if you have important data there remember to use a LiveCD and make a backup!!!\n", "Q: Installing packages remotely via bash script in ubuntu I am trying to install firefox packages to all my linux hosts remotely using a bash script. But when ever i execute the script i get the following error. How do i enable DISPLAY in bash script?\nError:\nNo protocol specified\nError: cannot open display: :0.0\nNo protocol specified\nError: cannot open display: :0.0\n\n\nA: That is very odd: the error seems to be generated by firefox needing to access X functionalities (which is normal), but those export commands should be sufficient to make it work (if you have a running X session on the hosts).\nThe only tips I can give to you is to replace the export line like this (you should only need one):\n#export DISPLAY=:0.0\nexport DISPLAY=:0\n\nor try to explicitly set the display on each command:\nsu user1 -c 'DISPLAY=:0 firefox -no-remote -CreateProfile firefox18'\n\n\nA: On the machine you want the firefox to appear on try running the command xhost -, this allows client windows to connect from any host. Once you've done running firefox you should probably run xhost + to keep secure.\n", "Q: Cannot access jump drives To Whom It May Concern:\nFor two months now I have not been able to get to the photos and files on my jump drives when I need to use them for various reasons. At the same time this started I also lost the bar at the bottom of the page that contained my minimized software. When I minimize, the software is lost to me until I shut down and restart. As such, I am simply making the window smaller and hiding widows on the page behind other windows so as to not lose anything I'll need later.\nCan anyone help me?\nThanks,\nTom M.\n\nA: Not sure exactly what version you are on, but you should be able to cycle through open applications by pressing alt + tab. If that doesn't work, I'm thinking that your apps aren't minimized. \nAlso consider using workspaces to keep running applications organized, it can be accessed in a number of ways. The coolest way to bring them up is with expo, press super + w. \nAs far as jump drives, my guess is that they are set up on a format that doesn't like. There are lots of ways to figure this out, usually even when Ubuntu isn't \"seeing\" them. Try plugging one in, then from a terminal enter\nlspci\nThis will give you a print out of every piece of everything connected to your pci bus. See if that lists anything that looks like your drive and go from there \n", "Q: Does Hadoop only run on (Ubuntu) Linux server OS or I can run it on desktop? Does Hadoop only run on (Ubuntu) Linux server OS or I can run it on desktop? Sorry for this silly question but I am a little confused about it. As I am trying to run Hadoop on my system and I don't want to use Cloudera or MapR versions of that.\n\nA: You can run it on your desktop if you want, people do this all the time with server software, though for testing/production needs you'll probably want to run it on a real server or cloud instance. \n", "Q: Turning computer on log? Is there a way to find out when my computer was turned on even if user was not successful on logging in?\n\nA: You can look in the syslog files in /var/log/ to see when the kernel was booted.

Searching for Command line: in the files will give you timestamps of when the system was booted into Ubuntu.\n", "Q: Building GCC 4.8 on Ubuntu 12.04 I am trying to install GCC 4.8 on Ubuntu 12.04, but during make I get the error shown below where compilation aborts.

To work from home, I SSH from my home computer to my lab computer as follows:\n# First a port knock is needed\njoe@homepc> telnet ssh.university.edu 9000\n\n# Next SSH to one of the external SSH servers of university\n# This logs me into one of many SSH servers serving as interface\njoe@homepc> ssh student7@ssh.university.edu\n\n# Finally SSH to my lab PC inside university network\nstudent7@university999> ssh joedude@labpc\n\n# And I am in my labpc\njoedude@labpc>\n\nHow do I use rsync to sync a directory on labpc with a directory on my homepc? Also, it would be awesome if there is some way to automate all of this so that I can rsync with just a single command from my homepc.\n\nA: There are several ways to solve this, however, because we want to run the rsync command on your home PC, I think the best way would be to create a tunnel from your home PC to the labpc, as follows:\njoe@homepc> ssh -L 2222:127.0.0.1:2222 student7@ssh.university.edu\n\nstudent7@university999> ssh -L 2222:127.0.0.1:22 joedude@labpc\n\nNow, on your home PC, you should be able to ssh directly into the lab PC:\njoe@homepc> ssh -p 2222 joedude@localhost\n\nOnce this is working, then you can build up an rsync script.\nI would add the following lines to ~/.ssh/config\n# Tunnel to labpc\nHost labpc_tun\nUser joedude\nPort 2222\n# ProxyCommand  ... TODO: set up tunnel automatically\nHostName 127.0.0.1\n\nNow, you should be able to do (in a separate window, after first two ssh logins are done):\njoe@homepc> rsync labpc_tun:/path-on-labpc/ /path-on-homepc/\n\nThere are lots more improvements you could make after this, but I would wait until you get the first part working, and then see how much automation you need.\nTo completely automate this you would need to use ssh-keygen to allow ssh logins without a password. You could also add more to .ssh/config for the first outgoing ssh leg. Using the ProxyCommand parameter in .ssh/config you could automate the entire thing.\n", "Q: dual boot with windows 8 I have installed ubuntu 12.10 64-bit alonside windows8 64 bit.

For maximum performance you may want to consider the lighter versions Lubuntu or Xubuntu. Here's a by no means exhaustive rundown of system requirements ranging from heaviest to lightest so that you can choose the best flavor for you!\nUbuntu\nXubuntu\nLubuntu\n", "Q: Repair a broken hard drive? I have a newer Toshiba hard drive with bad sectors... I don't hear anything loose, so I think maybe there is just a scratch in the disk somewhere... I heard of products that can \"buff\" out those scratches and restore the hard drive into good condition, but I have yet to find one.\nIs this even possible?\n\nA: I don't see how software can do anything about physical damage, and have never heard of anything that claims to.  I have seen programs that test a disk and block bad sectors for use, but the ones I am familiar with are all Windows things that would surely barf on an EXT3 partition if you could get them to run at all.  I suspect there is something already in Ubuntu or available that can do this, but I don't know what it would be.\n\nA: As @user148064 wrote, software can not repair a hardware problem.\nHowever, any SCSI hard drives and modern SATA drives have spare sectors. (You do not ask them for a specific track, sector and cylinder. You asked them for a sector number. The drive will report itself as \"I have X sectors of size Y\". Usually the drive actually has a few more.)\nWhen a sector fails to get read or written successfully it will copy that sector to a spare sector and substitute that on all subsequent accesses.\nThink of it as a book stating I have X pages with Y chars per page.\n\nIt has a nice index stating:\n  \"to read page 1, please turn to page 1\",\n  \"to read page 2, please turn to page 2\",\n  \"to read page 3, please turn to page 3\",\n  \"to read page 4, please turn to page 4\"\n  ...\n  \"to read page 100, please turn to page 100\"\n  etc. etc.\n\nNow you spill coffee on page 3. It replaces the index for page 3 with spare page 1.\n\nThe index now looks like this:\n  \"to read page 1, please turn to page 1\",\n  \"to read page 2, please turn to page 2\",\n  \"to read page 3, please turn to spare page 1\",\n  \"to read page 4, please turn to page 4\"\n  ...\n  \"to read page 100, please turn to page 100\"\n  etc. etc.\n\nYou can trigger this rereading and remapping process on a drive. That will help if you have any previously undetected corrupted pages (sectors).\nHowever the number of spare pages (sectors) is limited.  If you have a groove over the platter then this will not suffice (and that is assuming the head are undamaged, and those are the only likely candidates to make such a groove).\nIf the source of the failed sectors is something else, then please consider this as a sign of imminent disc failure.\ntl;dr: No software will not repair hardware, though in some cases it can work around the defect.\n", "Q: Can i have ubuntu in the same bootable usb stick for windows and mac? I would like to have in the same usb 2 partitions one for mac and the other for run ubuntu over windows.\n\nA: The USB boot is based upon what version of ubuntu you want to install, not what other OS was or will be on the machine.\nSo yes, one stick to rule them all.\n", "Q: Hardware compatibility regarding multiple audio interfaces on Intel i5 2G? I am running Windows 7 on my HP Pavilion g6-1225sm (2nd generation Intel Core i5-2450M processor 2.4GHz, Radeon HD6470M graphics, Intel HM65 Express Chipset...). I am also using Focusrite Saffire 6 USB (USB 2.0) audio interface.\nI would like to install Ubuntu Studio because I like the Jack Server option for connecting two different audio interfaces to work as one (if I understood it right)... I would like to buy one more audio interface and use it with the one that I already have.\nThe question:\nIs there any version of Ubuntu Studio compatible with this hardware of mine, and where can I download it?\n\nA: Usually the compatibility of the hardware is based on the kernel that the OS is running (3.8 in Ubuntu 12.04 and 3.11 in Ubuntu 13.10). I think that you won't have problems to try with Ubuntu Studio 12.04.3 LTS (more stable) and Ubuntu Studio 13.10 (latest) due to the specs of your computer http://h10025.www1.hp.com/ewfrf/wc/document?cc=es&lc=es&dlc=es&docname=c03003921#N46\nThe best thing I think you can do is try with a LiveUSB both version and try with your audio interface and an audio interface that someone could lend you to know with version could work better for you.\n", "Q: Compiling program that requires python 2.6 I'm trying to compile a software package but it fails with\ng++ -Wall -O0 -fno-strict-aliasing -I/usr/include/python2.6 -I/usr/include/python2.5  -g -pthread -fpic  -I../../plot/src -I../../math/src -I../../rclib/src/util -I../../rclib/src/conui -I../../rclib/src/io -I../../_general -I../../clop/src -I../../clop/src/real -I../../clop/src/artificial -I../../clop/src/math -DPTHREADS -DGUI=nogui -Drestrict=__restrict__ -DKBHIT_UNIX -DCLOCK_FTIME -c -o ../swig/clop_swig_wrap.o ../swig/clop_swig_wrap.cxx\n../swig/clop_swig_wrap.cxx:149:20: fatal error: Python.h: No such file or directory\ncompilation terminated.\nmake: *** [../swig/clop_swig_wrap.o] Error 1\n\nSince Python 2.6 is no longer available in synaptic, I downloaded, built, and installed it from http://www.python.org/download/releases/2.6.8/ , but it didn't add the 2.6 libraries to /usr/include\nHow do I get the python2.6 libraries into /usr/include on Ubuntu 12.04?\n\nA: I figured it out.\nsudo make install\n\ninstalls python header files to /usr/local/include/python2.6, but CLOP was searching for the files in /usr/include/python2.6\nI copied them over and there was no more trouble\n\nA: *\n\n*First download the source code.\n\n*Open up a terminal and cd to your download dir cd Downloads (or just Dow and tab ;)).\n\n*tar -xvf Python-2.6.8.tar.bz2\n\n*cd Python-2.6.8.tar.bz2  \n\n*./configure (and check if everything is configured correctly)\n\n*make\n\n*sudo make install\n\n*sudo cp -r /usr/local/include/python2.6 /usr/include/python2.6 and for solving your problem ;)\n\n\nAnd you are done ;).\nEDIT: /usr/local/include/python2.6 contains pyconfig.h whereas ./Include does not\n", "Q: How to get rid of 'Picture CD' label for hard drives I have 3 NTFS drives in my computer.

Cannot upgrade to 12.04 I am trying to use Ubuntu over Windows XP on my home computer but have completely fubared it.\nI first loaded an old disc I had of version 8.xxx.  It loaded fine and seemed to be running well.  I ran the update function and tried to update the computer to version 10.xxx.  With about 15 minutes left in the upgrade process terminal said something was wrong and was exiting, but it never did.\nI turned the computer off.  Upon re-boot it tries to load grub with a countdown.  If I hit escape before it tries to load grub it takes me to a menu to try different versions of 10.04.  One of the recovery modes seemed to do something like creating a maintenance shell and it gives me a root command line and tells me control d will terminate the shell.  Is there a command I can type on this line?  Other than that the computer will not load anything.  it comes up with an error stqating a kernal panic etc etc etc.  I have tried all of the options on the 10.04 options screen all with the same result.\nI made a live cd of 12.04.2 and tried to install it by re-starting the computer with the disc in the drive.  \nUbuntu seems to load because I can see part of the tool bar across the top of the screen and see where the program is asking me if I want to use or intall Ubunty, but I only have about 3/4 of my screen and the part that I can see is filled with horizontal lines.  I can see the cursor moving because it changes the line pattern on the screen.  The screen also seems to be divided vertically into about 4 or 5 segments.  I can click on some of the items in the toolbar across the top of the screen, but cannot read the menus or the window that the clicks open.  Is this a graphics card problem?\nHere are my thoughts.  Go back and re-load the version 8.xxx and get it running and then see if I can upgrade to the version 12.04 using the live cd from a function computer.  Can I jump versions or do I need to make my way up the upgrade chain?  If I have to go up the chain can I download the in between versions and burn them to a disc?\nAnyone else have any ideas to get me back up and running?\nThank you in advance.\n\nA: \nCan I jump versions or do I need to make my way up the upgrade chain?\n\nYou can only jump from LTS to LTS.\n\nIf I have to go up the chain can I download the in between versions and burn them to a disc? \n\nYes. But I would bot bother...\nMy advice would be...\n\n\n*\n\n*use a live cd to boot and mount your systems partitions.\n\n*backup all your private files OR put all your private data to a data partition if you have one.\n\n*Format system (but not the partition you saved your private data).\n\n*Install 12.04 or 12.10. During the part where your can partition if you put private data on to a partition, only add the partition and create a mount point (make sure you do not format it).\n\n\n\nAlso: always check if you can copy files from a backup back to your system before you start deleting files.\n", "Q: Cryptsetup failed Totally new to Ubuntu here, and I decided to give it a go and do a fresh install on my free-DOS Lenovo e330. Everything went smoothly all the way through the installation, and I decided to add an encryption password to the hard drive.\nNow I'm in a situation that I just can't login to Ubuntu. I'm using the password I created for the encryption but there must have been a mistake. Now I can't access the system.\nWhat could I do to reset the password, or just wipe Ubuntu off my SSD? I have no files there so wiping Ubuntu is an option for me.\n\nA: You can easily wipe the newly created system and install again. Before performing either of these options it's best to make sure that backups of any important files (that can't easily be replaced) from your computer are current.\nIf Ubuntu is the only installed OS then just boot from the Ubuntu live CD/DVD/USB and run the installer again, then tell it to install to the entire disk (overwriting all existing OSes, which happens to be just the Ubuntu system you already installed).\nIf Ubuntu is not the only installed OS and you want to keep the other OS, boot from the Ubuntu live CD/DVD/USB. Choose Try Ubuntu without installing (not Install Ubuntu). When you have a usable desktop, run the GParted Partition Editor by pressing the Super (Windows) key or clicking the Ubuntu logo at the upper left corner of the screen, and typing gparted. You'll see an icon for GParted come up. Click that icon.\nAssuming Ubuntu is the only GNU/Linux distribution you have installed, which is probably the case, any linux-swap or ext4 partition belongs to the newly created Ubuntu system.

I have purchased Corel Draw and I am required to use it for school.  Can I install this program on my Ubuntu system or is my Windows machine the only option here? I do have Inkscape and love it but I have a professor that requires Corel Draw in class.  \nAs well, there are other programs that I will be required to use for school in the future, if I cannot use Corel Draw with Ubuntu, then is it safe to assume that I won't be able to use any of the others with my Ubuntu system if a professor insists on one in particular?  Thanks for your assistance.\n\nA: You can not run it natively. If you want to stick with Ubuntu and not depend on Windows Inkscape would be the best alternative. If you must use Corel Draw ...\n\n\n*\n\n*Dual booting is always an option. \n\n*The best method from within Ubuntu would be to install VirtualBox, install Windows inside a VirtualBox and install Corel Draw inside Windows. There is a very good and very lenghty tutorial on how to do this on ubuntuforums.org. This would be my advice since you can then also install all kinds of other software you might need that is Windows only. \n\n*Wine most times is a viable option but for Corel Draw it seems to be a gamble. WineHQ shows a lot of garbage ratings and 1 platinum. Without some knowledge on how Wine works and how you can troubleshoot problems adds an extra difficulty. Plus if you want to use extra other software you would face that problem again.\n", "Q: How can I list all packaged installed by me? I am trying to clean my installation up a bit, so I decided to clean up my packages a bit. However, I'm having trouble with that: My wish is to make apt-get list all packages installed by me. If I list every package, I also see the dependencies of my packages although I am not interested in those. For example, I want to see that I installed lightyears but I do not want to see the packages installed alongside, like python-numpy or python-pygame. Is there a way to do this?\n\nA: I think there is no command that let you get that information directly, but you may get that information inspecting APT logs. APT stores a history of commands in /var/log/apt/history.log, with entries with the following format:\nStart-Date: ** time when command was issued **\nCommandline: ** command used **\nInstall | Upgrade | Remove: ** packages installed/upgraded/removed to satisfy the command **\nEnd-Date: ** time when command have finished **\n\nCommands typed by you should appear as you typed (so a sudo apt-get install numpy will appear as Commandline: apt-get install numpy). In my system the only other commands appearing in this log are from aptdaemon, that should be issued by Update Manager.\nPlease note that this log is rotated from time to time, so you may not have there all commands issued by you from the beginning, or you may need to extract a compressed part of it. Also if you have multiple users I think you will not be able to know which one installed what.\n\nA: It's a quick hack, but this gets me very close:\nmanifest='http://releases.ubuntu.com/raring/ubuntu-13.04-beta2-desktop-amd64.manifest'\n\ncomm -2 -3 \\\n  <(apt-mark showmanual | sort) \\\n  <(curl --silent \"$manifest\" | grep --perl-regexp --only-matching '^[\\w-.+]+' | sort)\n\nYou'll have to look up the package manifest for your version of Ubuntu from the releases server.\nThis method still returns a few packages that were selected via the Language Support installation prompt and the install third-party software checkbox, but depending on your needs it might be good enough.\n\nA: I'm trying this:\n\n\n*\n\n*go get the \"manifest\" file for your version as mentioned by ændrük above\n\n*apt-mark showmanual\nto get a list of all packages apt-mark considers manually installed\n\n*eliminate the dups between those lists, keeping the remainder of the output of apt-mark showmanual\n\n\nI don't know if this really works, but it looks pretty likely to me. Any thoughts???\n", "Q: How can I use custom wallpapers for the login screen? I recently Installed 12.10 version and I loved it! But the there's something weird with Wallpapers. As long as I use a wallpaper from the /usr/share/backgrounds folder (I use the \"appearance\" dialog box), this wallpapers appears also on my welcome (login) screen. But when I try to use a wallpaper from my pictures folder (again using the \"+\" button from the appearance dialog box), my login screen has the standard ubuntu 12.10 wallpaper. Is there anything I can do to fix this? \nThanks in advance! \n\nA: When you copy the picture to /usr/share/backgrounds you also need to change the permissions - read-write for owner and read-only for others. \nThis can be accomplished by running the following command in a terminal:\n\nsudo chmod 644 filename\n\n\nA: Ubuntu tweak can do this:\n\nMy login now shows dragonlady.\n", "Q: Can I reload monitors.xml without restarting LightDM? I was writing myself a short script to turn off my laptops monitor in order to only use the bigger external monitor, as I don't always want to use Unity GUI. But after turning the laptop monitor back on with the same script the configurations were all wrong, so I was wondering if there is a way to reload monitors.xml (from the ./config) where all the configurations are stored without restarting whole lightdm? I did this in the current script, and not only killed it all my programs but also did I get an error regarding my keyboard input. \nAbout the setting: My left, smaller monitor is my primary and the right one the secondary. But if monitor.xml is not reloaded both are primary monitors.\nIs it probably necessary to restart lightdm? If so, how can I do that in a as secure as possible way without killing all processes (if possible of course).\n\nA: I found a very simple way to solve the problem:\nIt is possible to give xrandr the configurations for the monitor as additional options. In my case it were the following: \nxrandr --output LVDS1 --auto --mode 1366x768 --pos 0x0 --rotate normal --primary\nxrandr --output VGA1 --auto --mode 1680x1050 --pos 1366x0 --rotate normal\n\nwith LVDS1 being the laptops monitor and VGA1 the external monitor. (can be inqueried with xrandr -q).\nThis way it is not necessary to reload monitors.xml or restart lightdm and one can even specify different configurations in one scirpt.\n\nA: I don't know the exact mechanism to reload monitors.xml, but I do know that file is a GNOME thing.  So maybe killing and restarting gnome-settings-daemon would do the trick.\n", "Q: Nvidia Driver crashes compiz I've installed Nvidia driver from terminal with sudo apt-get install nvidia-current, and after that compiz crashes every time after I log in.

There doesn't seem to be a good solution to bringing a GUI popup to enter the SAMBA password. And since I don't want to save the password in either credential file, fstab or individual autofs files. I will live with it as it is and start a terminal and write:\nmount ~/npn/d\n\nand then enter the SAMBA password in the terminal.\n\nA: Faced with the same problem.\nFor me mounting a CIFS share from a NAS\nProblems being faced...\n1/ mount has no method of specifying a password handler (such as used by sudo, ssh, etc)\n2/ Putting the password in the fstab makes it readable by any one on the system at any time!\n3/ mount can be given a password as a option but that means it is on the command line and for a brief moment the password is visible to anyone on the system.

I am not sure if the answer given there would work for me, because I didn't entirely understand what needed to be done. I'm still new to Linux.\n---------- The Issue In Short:\nI have a laptop where the mouse and keyboard both fail to function once it has booted into Ubuntu. This has been happening since day one (initial Ubuntu install), but it used to be a rare occurrence. Now (for the last few weeks), it has gotten worse, moving from happening once every ~20 boot ups, to easily happening 30 boot ups in a row.\n---------- Machine Details:\n\n\n*\n\n*I'm using a Toshiba Satellite L875D-S7230.\n\n*The default Windows 7 install has been untouched, but the partition has been scaled to make room for Ubuntu.\n\n*I have an up to date install of Ubuntu 12.10, setup to duel boot with the default Win7 install.\n\n*The Linux wifi driver had to be compiled and installed manually. (whole different issue)\n\n*I am using the proprietary video card driver that came pre-installed with Ubuntu.\n\n\nHibernation is disabled to prevent the computer from locking up. (a common problem I've read). The computer can't reboot properly, I have to always shut it down. (not an issue I'm concerned with right now)\n---------- Problem Details:\nThe built in keyboard and mouse both fail when Ubuntu loads. The failure seems to be instant, as I do not have the ability to move the mouse or type any keys from the moment I see a cursor appear on screen.\nThe keyboard doesn't respond in any way. Pressing Num-Lock, Scroll-Lock, or Caps-Lock does not make any of the indicator lights turn on.\nThe only button on the laptop that seems to do anything is the power button, which allows me to hard boot the machine.\nThe only USB device I own to assist in troubleshooting is a mouse. Luckily, it has worked every time I plug it in. It has never failed, and is currently the only way I can turn off the laptop without hard booting it. I only plug in the mouse when the built in mouse and keyboard fail.\nThe mouse and keyboard both work perfectly under Win7, and the keyboard works perfectly when GRUB loads. The failure only happens when I select Ubuntu and the OS begins to load.\n\nIf anybody can help I would greatly appreciate it. I'm not sure what the issue could be, and my laptop is almost unusable at present.\n\nA: I have exactly the same laptop and searching on the web this is what I found to solve the problem:\n1) Run the following command in terminal\nsudo nano /etc/default/grub\n\n2) Locate the following section in the file:\nGRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX=\" \"\n\nReplace it with: \nGRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX=\"i8042.nomux=1 locale=fr_FR i8042.reset\"\n\n3) Save the file and exit nano.\n4) Run the following command in terminal:\nsudo update-grub\n\n5) Restart your computer.\nNow everything should work fine.\n", "Q: Gnome 3 and discrete only nvidia Long ago I've installed Gnome 3 over Ubuntu 12.10\nCurrently I'm working on a scientific project, that requires lot of graphical work.

Fx USB 1.0 supports 12Mbit/s and USB 2.0 supports 480Mbit/s. However, when a device is connected, the operating system negotiates a speed with the device.

Check them: ls -ld /proc\nThis should fix it:\nsudo chmod 755 /proc\n\nIf this isn't enough, a reboot is probably easiest. You may be able to limp on.\nCheck if other files in /proc are affected as well: ls -l /proc. Depending on which files were affected, the following may be enough of a fix (this isn't a complete list, only the most important).\nsudo chmod -R 755 /proc/[a-z]*\nfind /proc -type d -exec sudo chmod +x {} +\nsudo chmod 600 /proc/kcore /proc/kmsg /proc/kpagecount /proc/kpageflags /proc/vmallocinfo\nsudo chmod 200 /proc/sysrq-trigger\n\nMake sure that you don't have a line for /proc in /etc/fstab (it's normally not needed because the startup script mount it early in the boot process anyway), or if you do, it contains only the following (and optionally 0 0 at the end):\nproc  /proc  proc  defaults\n\nIf your fstab is correct and a reboot doesn't fix everything, you have a bigger problem.

I need to do a graphical map of all the layer-2 and layer-3 machines running in my LAN.\nI don't want a graphical tool like Dia or similar, but a kind of \"graphical Nmap\" which shows the real cabling of the LAN (including switches, too!).\nIn fact, something like this: http://www.solarwinds.com/network-topology-mapper.aspx\n\nA: To my knowledge, there are few comparable software packages available, free and out-of-the-box, for Ubuntu that don't require quite a bit of manual configuration.\nOpenNMS might come close for your needs.\nThe Network Topology Mapper(and the SolarWinds Tool Suite, in general) is a very good, mid-level, network management tool. Unfortunately, it is Windows only and comes with a significant price tag. Without a great deal of customization, you will be hard-pressed to find a comparable solution. If you have the budget and run a heterogeneous shop, I can strongly recommend using this piece of software. Also, their IPAM and NetFlow tools are quite solid, as well.\nThat said, I know of three pieces of software that run on Linux and might give you a start dynamically mapping your network: Cheops, OPManager, and OpenNMS.\nI would also recommend looking at the SLAC page to see if there are any more recent developments in the network management space.\nThe following applications are listed, in ascending order, in terms of cost, complexity, and feature-sets. \nCheops\nCheops is a free network mapping solution that will go out and discover and graphically display the servers and network nodes for you. It is old, and possibly no longer under development. But, it is a simple tool to use for network discovery.\n\nYou can download Cheops, here\nOpenNMS\nOpenNMS is able to do network discovery, event management, and performance management. It is available as a .deb package as well.\n\nCore features:\n\n\n*\n\n*Automatic Layer-2 and Layer-3 link discovery\n\n*Automatic Network / Node Discovery and Provisioning\n\n*Automatic Service Discovery and Provisioning\n\n*IPv6 support throughout (new)\n\n*Manual Node and Service Provisioning Requisitions\n\n*Path Outage support\n\n\nFeature list\nOpenNMS download\nInstallation instructions for deb/apt-get.\nOPManager\nOpManager, on the other hand, is a commercial tool. It has a similar feature-set of the SolarWinds solution. In my experience, it is very robust and customizable. That said, you will have to pay for it. It does run on Debian-based systems, though it is not custom-tailored for Ubuntu. YMMV.\n\nIn terms of network management functionality, it supports:\n\n\n*\n\n*Availability and Uptime Monitoring\n\n*Traffic and Utilization Monitoring\n\n*Cisco Monitoring\n\n*Network Device Health Monitoring\n(Router, Switch, Firewall, wireless access points)\n\n*Network Mapping\n\n*Custom Network Maps / Network Traffic Maps\n\n*WAN RTT Monitoring\n\n*Network Traffic Analysis (NetFlow, sFlow)\n\n*VoIP Monitoring\n\n*Network Configuration Management\n\n*IP Address Management\n\n*Switch Port Mapper\n\n\nFor a full list of features, see:\nhere\nYou can download a free trial of OPManager here\nI would be very interested in hearing from others in regards to using a free, unified network management solution in Ubuntu that does not require in-house development and a great deal of care and feeding. \nIn the mean time, when it's unreasonable to use OPManager, or OpenNMS, I will have to make due with my own custom Nagios/Cacti/SmokePing/Rancid/IPPlan solution for smaller networks.\n\nA: A tool I've used and loved for ages is EtherApe, which may be another possibility you may want to check out.

I see a lot of charms with both a relation-changed and a relation-joined hook for their relations.  Sometimes the two hooks are even the same file, with one being a symlink to the other.  However, the juju docs say that both the relation-joined and relation-changed hooks run when a relation is joined.\nShould my charm include only one hook or the other, not both?\n\nA: This depends on the use case for the charm. Here's a good way to think of what each relation hook does and when it's executed:\nrelation-joined\nThis is always the first hook to be executed, it's also only executed once during the lifespan of that specific service to service relation. There's now guarantee on which of the two services hook will fire first, but it will always be the first of the set of relation hooks to fire off. A lot of charms don't need this, but some charms this is very important. If you have any set-up details you need to execute first, then this is where they will happen. Take a database server for example: Most database server charms use the relation-joined hook to create the database, user, password, and other details that the other service will be waiting on. It could do this during the relation-changed hook, but it would add more complexity to make sure it didn't recreate the database and user over and over again (more on why that would happen in a second).\nrelation-changed\nThis gets run once right after a successful relation-joined execution. Then every time data is sent on the wire between the services this hook is executed again. As such, it really needs to be idempotent as it will likely be executed more than once. So a lot of charms will gather the expected relation-get data and make sure it exists before continuing. As to why both the relation-joined AND relation-changed hooks fire one after the other on the joined event is likely to allow for ease of use and not require a relation-joined hook explicitly.\nAs to what should your charm include, that's entirely up to you and the use case for your charm. Not every charm has a relation-joined, in fact few do considering the size of the store. It's really only used when there's an explicit need to do something only once during the lifecycle of that relation. Just so we're clear, when I mean \"only once\", I'm speaking about executing of the juju add-relation. If you add another relation to another service the relation-joined hook and the whole lifecycle starts over again.

Or at least, that is what I think.\nFor example, if I search for Steam on Muon Software Center or Muon Package Manager, I just can't find it; even if I use sudo apt-get install steam-launcher. But on Ubuntu I have no problem. Why?\nThat's why I think Ubuntu has some repositories that Kubuntu doesn't. In this case (I don't know if I'm right), how can I add this Ubuntu repositories?\nSteam is only an example. There are many packages that I can't find on Kubuntu. Another example: Motorbike (a game) (https://apps.ubuntu.com/cat/applications/precise/motorbike/). sudo apt-get install motorbike doesn't work.\nRegards.\n\nA: Kubuntu Wikipedia page: Every package in Kubuntu shares the same repositories as Ubuntu. However Steam and Motorbike aren't in the default ubuntu/kubuntu repositories. So you will have to enable the universe and multiverse repositories.\nManaging Repositories in Kubuntu\n\nKubuntu uses KPackageKit for software management. To open it, click on your Kmenu, then open System Settings.\n\nNext, select \"Add and Remove Software\"\n\nClick the \"Settings\" button, then select \"Edit Software Sources\".\n\nYou will be prompted for your password in order to proceed\n\nNext, go the the \"Updates\" tab. From here, you can enable/disable some of the official Ubuntu repositories and change your update settings. You should enable the universe and the multiverse repos.\nOr, you could just type a line or two of commands and get the job done as follows:\nsudo add-apt-repository \"deb http://archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu $(lsb_release -sc) main universe multiverse\"\n\nthen\nsudo apt-get update\n\nthen\nsudo apt-get upgrade\n\nKubuntu repository installation instruction page\n\nA: I had the same issue with kubuntu 12.04.3 LTS.  I tried the terminal commands above but when I checked /etc/apt/sources.list the entries for universe and multiverse were incorrect.\nThe answer is to manually edit the file: \nsudo nano /etc/apt/sources.list\n\nThen add the following two lines:\ndeb http://archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/ precise universe multiverse\ndeb-src http://archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/ precise universe multiverse\n\nThen save and exit.

The application came from the Ubuntu Software Center, so I do not know if there is a specific folder were all the apps are so I can edit one. Any suggestions? Thanks!\n\nA: Use apt-get source pkgname from the command line. Doesn't matter what language it's in --as long as the package is open source and in the repositories\n\nA: Your ability to edit the application's code depends on if it was compiled or not. If it was written in a language like C, it would be impossible to do so. If, however, the application was written in a language like Python or with HTML/JavaScript, it is quite simple. The best way I have found to find this sort of thing out is to open up a terminal and try the following:\n which <program name> #This may or may not be successful. For Google Chrome, you would say \"google-chrome\" instead of \"chrome.\" Try again if at first you don't succeed.\n gedit <whatever the previous command spits out>\n\nIf gedit does not show plain text, than you are out of luck. It it does, than you have found \"main\" file for the program and will be able to work from there.\n", "Q: What's wrong with PHP 5.4.6 and what can I do about it? I recently installed Ubuntu 12.10 server with the stock version of Apache2, PHP and MySQL. Something is wrong with PHP - first I thought it was an issue with PHP Markdown, as the script came to a screeching halt (after being locked for a few seconds) on line 1420 with the error\n\nFatal error: Allowed memory size of 134217728 bytes exhausted (tried\n  to allocate 130968 bytes) in\n  /.../vendor/Markdown.php on line 1420\n\nAfter a while I gave up debugging PHP Markdown, decided to temporarily disable it and move on with my project.

I recently ran this project on PHP 5.3 on a different system without problems. Something about my current PHP setup is causing loops to continue for ever and running out of memory.\nIMPORTANT NOTE: Both PHP Markdown and PDO (MySQL) works perfectly in the CLI version of PHP on this very same system - the problem is only with Apache2 + PHP.\nAre there any settings, bugs or quirks you know about that can cause this behaviour in PHP?\n\nHere is my phpinfo()\n\nA: I'm not sure why you're focussing on the database. The error is really very clear: PHP has run out of allotted RAM. We can create hypothesises as to why this has happened but digging through other people's code (especially when it's PHP) is a loveless task.

I was looking at the schedule and noticed that Wubi is being discontinued. \nI like the setup I have now (Windows 7 and Ubuntu 12.10), and would like to use 13.4. \n\nA: Wubi instalations are not required but are working well. (You just notice that I/O disk performance is bad). \nWith the support dropped, you cannot instal it. You can however try and upgrade from 12.10 after having verified that there were no changes in grub/kernel versions from 12.10 to 13.04.\nMy advice is to keep a 12.04 LTS w/ Wubi if you want to keep that configuration.\n", "Q: How to wipe /data on nexus 4 to install ubuntu-touch I'm trying to replace my current Ubuntu Touch Developer Preview with the next daily build.\nI'm following the directions here https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Touch/Install\nAfter entering 'phablet-flash -l' I get the following error.

As per the title, why isn't there an alternative to XAMPP which completely installs in Linux?\nI have tried everyone that I've come across and none yet have completely installed.\n\nA: The default stack on Ubuntu (or any Linux system) is LAMP and it has been for a very long time.\n\nWikipedia\nLAMP is a combination of free, open source software. The acronym LAMP refers to the first letters of Linux (operating system), Apache HTTP Server, MySQL (database software), and PHP, Perl or Python, principal components to build a viable general purpose web server.\nThe exact combination of software included in a LAMP package may vary, especially with respect to the web scripting software, as Perl or Python are sometimes dropped from the stack. Similar terms exist for essentially the same software suite (AMP) running on other operating systems, such as Microsoft Windows (WAMP), Mac OS (MAMP), Solaris (SAMP), iSeries (iAMP), or OpenBSD (OAMP).\n\nUbuntu has a special program to install extra sets of software (like LAMP); you can install it with\nsudo apt-get install tasksel\n\nand then choose from a list of options LAMP:\n\nThe system will install a pre-configured version of LAMP and will also ask for password for MySQL admin. This has worked out of the box for me for years\nBesides that: please avoid using XAMP since the LAMP stack in Ubuntu is better tested and hardend.\n\nEasiest method installing LAMP is this single command:\nsudo apt-get install lamp-server^\n\nThe ^ indicates apt-get needs to install the task lamp-server.\n\nA: I would suggest you give devilbox a try. This is a cross-platform dockerized LAMP stack which offers:\n\n\n*\n\n*Apache/Nginx\n\n*PHP/HHVM\n\n*MySQL/MariaDB\n\n*PostgreSQL\n\n\nAdditionally you can combine every major version of the above services. A few examples of how you could start up your stack:\n\n\n*\n\n*apache2.2, php54, mysql5.7 and pgsql9.3\n\n*nginx-mainline, php70, mariadb10.2  and pgsql9.6\n\n*apache2.4, hhvm, mariadb10.0  and pgsql9.5\n\n\nSome batteries are also included:\n\n\n*\n\n*phpMyAdmin\n\n*Adminer\n\n*auto mass-virtual host\n\n\n\n\nA: Installing Xampp on Wİndows may be very needed. Because combination of multiple servers and coordinating with them settings is   difficult and complex. But in Ubuntu these servers are magically so coordinated. You can install  LAMPP too, but as you want install other softwares as like as Mysql Workbench, modifying new softwares with Lampp is time vesting. So you can setup all needed servers on Ubuntu easily and with some simple steps.  Install Linux, Apache, MySQL, PHP (LAMP) stack on Ubuntu is here.\n", "Q: X.Org X Server driver or AMD proprietary driver? I see that my machine (Radeon HD 6290) has the option to choose either the X.Org X Server driver or the AMD proprietary driver:\n\nI want to know which one is the recommended one in term of performance in general? Do one of them have an edge over the other? And apart from performance, is there any stability issue with them in general? How often are they updated?\n\nA: The xorg open source driver is far more stable than the proprietary one, so if you don't need any of the features of the proprietary driver, stay with the open source driver.\nFglrx and fglrx-updates are the same when a new version of Ubuntu is released. Fglrx-updates later is updated when newer drivers are released by AMD, while fglrx is in general not updated until you upgrade to a new release of Ubuntu. This means, that fglrx-updates will probably have better performance, less bugs and more features than fglrx, yet it might in principle happen, that an update is released for it, which contains new bugs (which might even prevent your system from starting a GUI).\nNow to the advantages of the proprietary driver:\n\n\n*\n\n*It has far superior 3D performance, what is also relevant for desktop performance when using a compositing window manager (Unity uses Compiz, which greatly relies on 3D acceleration)\n\n*With it the graphics card uses less power (mainly relevant on laptops)\n\n*It comes with OpenCL support, meaning that some programs can benefit from the graphics chip (for instance imagemagick, although I think this feature is disabled on Ubuntu)\n\n*You can use VAAPI to get hardware accelerated video decoding (for instance in VLC media player), but this usually is only required on very slow CPUs, like AMD C-series or Intel Atom.\n\n*On some cards, the open source driver does not support audio output over HDMI, in this case, use the proprietary driver.\n\n\nNow the disadvantages of the proprietary driver\n\n\n*\n\n*Did I mention that it's less stable than the open source driver? \n\n*On some systems tearing artifacts are visible when playing video files (there is a setting in the Catalyst Control Center to prevent this, yet it doesn't work on some systems)\n\n*For some settings one has to use Catalyst Control Center instead of Ubuntu System Settings, for instance if you want to extend the desktop to a second monitor for the first time.\n\n\nSince they are mentioned in one of the comments, just a word regarding the experimental drivers: I don't recommend to use them, they are at the moment (at least on 12.04) incompatible with some other packages (most notably: hardware video decoding and opencl don't work without ugly hacks). If you really need the latest drivers from AMD, get them from the AMD website and use them to build distribution specific packages.\nLong story short: If everything works fine for you with the open source drivers, use these. If you want or need one of the features mentioned above, and you are ok with the very small risk that an update breaks something, use fglrx-updates, otherwise fglrx. Don't use the experimental drivers if you are not sure what you are doing.\n", "Q: What is the name of the icon for usb drives in Ubuntu?

The 8 gig partition is EFI.\n\nMy instinct is to get rid of all the crazy little partitions on /dev/sda and probably use it for my home folder. The SSD on /dev/sdb I was thinking I would use for / so the OS would boot quickly.\nMy questions:\nIs there enough space on the ~29 Gig /dev/sdb drive for the OS?\nIs deleting the EFI partition a mistake? Does it mess up firmware upgrades?\nIs there any reason to keep any of those OEM partitions if I am never going to use Windows?\n\nA: I don't know what you mean by /dev/sdb1 being \"EFI.\" The Extensible Firmware Interface (EFI) is your firmware and is stored on an EEPROM on your motherboard, not on a disk (except for developer tools like DUET or the \"firmware\" used in virtual machines). The EFI does have an associated partition, the EFI System Partition (ESP), but it's a FAT32 partition that's normally 100-600MiB in size and that has a particular partition type code. Your /dev/sdb1 holds an unrecognized (that is, not FAT) filesystem, according to the GParted screen shot, and does not have the ESP type code, so it's not an ESP. Your /dev/sda1, OTOH, is an ESP; it's FAT32 and has its \"boot flag\" set (which is GParted's way of identifying the ESP type code).\nTo answer your bigger question, if you don't care about the Windows you've got on your computer or any of the other software or data that Dell has provided, you can delete all your partitions, on both /dev/sda and /dev/sdb, with the caveat that since I don't know what /dev/sdb1 is, I don't know if it might have some non-standard purpose for the firmware. (It's more likely that it's used by Windows, though.) When you install Ubuntu, it will create whatever partitions it requires, including a fresh ESP. (The existing ESP just holds the Windows boot loader and associated data, so deleting it shouldn't be a problem.) If you want to preserve your ability to install re-install Windows in the future, though, you should preserve /dev/sda6 and perhaps /dev/sda4. Alternatively, in the Windows 7 era, it was common for manufacturers to provide a utility to let you burn a set of DVD-Rs that would enable you to re-install Windows. You could look for such a tool in your current system and back up the relevant data in that way.\n\nA: First: 20 GB should be enough for the root partition, at least if you put /tmp somewhere else and you don't intend to install large games system wide. 28-29 GB would be even better. /tmp is used for instance for temporary data when burning DVDs, so I recommend that one being bigger than 10 GB.\nSecond: The EFI partition does afaik only store data that has something to do with the installed operating systems, so if you want to get rid of Windows completely, it should be safe to remove it and (if you don't want to be forced to use BIOS emulation) to create a new one for Ubuntu (I'm not an EFI expert, so please don't blame me if this does not work - maybe you should make a backup of the whole SSD by dd'ing it to a file on an external HDD first?). According to the Ubuntu Wiki UEFI Guide, an EFI partition of 200 MB should be sufficient for Ubuntu, so by deleting the current one and creating a new one, you could get some more space for your root partition, yet it's not a necessary step, for Ubuntu can make use of a present Windows EFI partition as well. Afaik only Apple computers use the EFI partition for firmware updates (but as said I'm not an expert). One more thing: Some broken EFI firmwares don't allow you to install Ubuntu in EFI mode. If this applies to your notebook, you can simply use BIOS mode by booting the live DVD in BIOS mode.\nOn every computer I know, there exists no reason to keep any of the OEM partitions if one doesn't want to reinstall Windows without a Windows DVD.\n", "Q: How to get my script to start up!

In Chrome, for instance, you can activate experimental smooth scrolling support from the flags menu, which you can access by typing chrome://flags/ in your address bar.\n", "Q: files do not save in /media/data New to Ubuntu, a free OS of greatness, I followed the step by step procedure in one of the online resources of Ubuntu for installing the OS. As instructed, I learned that I have to create the following spaces in the drive: 1.Root 2.Home 3.Swap.\nConcerning Home partition, where it is said \"your files are kept,\" the instruction is to enter in its MOUNT POINT: \"/media/data.\" However, after the installation, when I'm trying to transfer all my files into the new OS, a window appeared noting, \"The volume \"Filesystem root\" has only 95.8Mb disc space remaining.\"\nWhat went wrong? Why are my files not saved in the Home partition?\nPlease help. I'm a newbie ubuntu user.\n\nA: Your personal files, such as documents, music, videos, and so forth, are saved in your home folder. A home partition contains users' home folders. System files, like the files that comprise all the installed programs, are not stored there.\nIf you made an extremely small partition for /, and you just installed, the best thing to do is delete the new partitions and install again.\nAlso, the mount point for /home is /home; if you created a partition and gave it the mount point /media/data, that's not /home and your home directory won't (and shouldn't) automatically be put there.\n\nIf you want, you can show us all your partitions and how they're being used by opening a Terminal window (Ctrl+Alt+T) and running the commands:\nmount\ndf -h\nsudo parted -l\n\n\nThen it might be possible for more specific advice to be given. But most likely, this is the advice that pertains:\n\n\n*\n\n*Ubuntu can create its own partitions automatically. It does this very well. Especially if you don't know what partitions to create or how large to make them, letting Ubuntu's installer partition automatically is a good choice.\nIf you are going to partition manually:\n\n*Whatever release of Ubuntu you are installing will specify how large the disk needs to be, to install. You should take this as the minimium size of the / partition. Usually the / partition should be much larger. If your disk is 50 GB or more, / should be 20 GB or larger. If your disk is 200 GB or more, / should be 70 GB or larger.\n\n*By default a swap partition is created. If you are partitioning manually, you should create one. It should be a few gigabytes large. There are many competing ideas about how to determine the best size of a swap partition; that is beyond the scope of this very basic advice. But Ubuntu can make, and choose the size for, its own swap partition too.\n\n*A separate home partition has the mount point /home. If you use one, make sure it's large enough for whatever you intend to put in it. /home contains the home folders associated with all the human user accounts on the machine. Most users put their documents and downloads in their home folder and Ubuntu defaults to facilitating this. You might also want to store potentially bigger collections of files in your home folder: music, videos, and so forth. (The other reasonable option is to put it on a separate hard drive.)\nPractically speaking, a separate home partition should usually be at least 30 GB, and much larger if you have the space and plan to store a lot of personal data (i.e., data that is maintained by you, rather than installed and updated by Ubuntu's package manager) on the system.\n", "Q: 4Gb sd recognized as 1.6Gb I used as dd command to make my 4GB sd card bootable for arch linux arm as explained here since it didn't work I tried formatting the card in my ubuntu again but now it recognizes it as a 1.6GB card and a 32MB card. \nIs there any way I can restore my card?\n\nA: The dd command has the effect of creating whatever partition or partitions are in the image file you start with (i.e., the file given after if=). Those partitions' sizes are not determined by the size of the disk being written to (i.e., the disk specified after of=). When the disk is larger than necessary, it will have unpartitioned space after being written to with dd. Reformatting the partitions that already exist does not change their size and consequently will not make the extra space accessible.\nRepartitioning the SD card is the solution. Install the gparted  package.  Assuming there is nothing of any value on the SD card, you can use GParted to delete the existing partitions (or to create a new partition table, which will get rid of them too). After the gparted package is installed you can run GParted by typing it into the dash (press the Super/Windows key or click the home button on the upper-left corner of the screen, then start typing in gparted until the GParted icon appears; then click on it).\nMake sure you are editing the partitions on the SD card, and not on some other drive; if you accidentally perform actions on the wrong drive with GParted, you could experience great data loss. (And if you ever do need to modify the partitions on the physical disk that contains the running Ubuntu system, it's not safe to run GParted from the system on that disk to do that. Instead, for that purpose, you must run GParted from a live CD/DVD/USB instead.)\nTo make sure you're on the SD card and not some other device, select in from the drop-down menu at the upper-right corner of the GParted window. Make sure its partitions are the same size and type as you expected. An SD card will typically be called /dev/mmcblkN, where N is a number (usually 0, if you only have one SD card). The device names for the partitions on an SD card called /dev/mmcblk0 are called /dev/mmcblk0p1, /dev/mmcblk0p2, and so forth. You can verify that the drive name takes the form /dev/mmcblkN in the drop-down menu where you select it, and also that its partitions are listed as the device name with pN appended.\nOnce you've verified that you're working on the right disk, create whatever partition(s) you want. If you want one big partition, create one, of whatever partition type you prefer. (Most SD cards are formatted FAT32.)\n\nA: Open disk utility in ubuntu to view, modify and configure disks and media. Just unmount it first before formatting. Hope it help!\n", "Q: What is icon-theme.cache?

What is the meaning of cache in these filenames? The cache tag definition is this: \"a cache stores temporary data nearby so that it can be retrieved much more quickly than fetching it from the real backing store (disk, network), or recalculating some result all over again\".\n\n*Why are the file sizes so diverse? Are the gnome and hicolor ones the largest because they provide the fallback icons (as I read somewhere)? \n\n*What about the dates? I'm only sure about the ubuntu-mono ones because they came along when I installed light-themes on 20130408. So do these files get modified during the course of switching themes or are the dates just a reflection of the date of installation?\n\n\nA: To understand why we need these files, you need to first understand the concept of mapping files to memory.\nMemory Mapped Files: Memory mapped files are segments of virtual memory that are directly mapped to a physical file on disk, byte-by-byte. It has a number of benefits over traditional stream based I/O, such as performance during random access to large files, or the ability to share the mapped memory between different threads and processes.\nAccessing memory mapped files is faster than using direct read and write operations for two reasons. Firstly, a system call is orders of magnitude slower than a simple change to a program's local memory. Secondly, in most operating systems the memory region mapped actually is the kernel's page cache (file cache), meaning that no copies need to be created in user space.\nNow, taking your questions one by one:\n\n*\n\n*What is icon-theme.cache and what is its function? What is the meaning of cache in these filenames?\nThe file icon-theme.cache contains cached information about the icons in the directory tree below a certain directory (which happens to be the one containing index.theme for the particular theme).\nGTK+ can use the cache files to avoid a lot of system call and disk seek overhead when the application starts. Since the format of the cache files allows them to be memory mapped shared between multiple applications, the overall memory consumption is reduced as well.\n\n\n*Why are the file sizes so diverse?\nThe file sizes depend on the number of icons in the icon theme.\n\n\n*What about the dates?\nIf we take memory caches, something is present in cache only if some process accesses a particular memory location and remains there unless the cache is full and that element needs to be removed.\nHence, the modification date would most likely depend on when some process updated it. In this case, it might be when the icons from the theme were used.\nThere is, indeed, a command to update the icon cache named gtk-update-icon-cache.\nSources and further information:\n\n*\n\n*Wikipedia - Memory Mapped File\n\n\n*StackOverflow - Advantages of Memory Mapped Files\n\n\n*MSDN - Memory Mapped File Quirks\n\n\n*gtk-update-theme-cache man page\n\n\n*man gtk-update-icon-cache in current (13.04) man pages\n", "Q: How to save web pages completely I want to save web pages for offline reading.

This\n  includes such things as inlined images, sounds, and referenced\n  stylesheets.\n\nor even \n\n‘-m’\n  ‘--mirror’\n  Turn on options suitable for mirroring.

I would like to use build myself a mini NAS (RAID level 1). The Problem is it only has 2 SATA Ports and I would like use, at least, 3 TB Disks.

(And, yongzhy's solution above doesn't work --- the Search key still expresses \"mod4\" in addition to \"control\", and \".xinitrc\" doesn't seem to be executed.)\n#! /bin/bash -f\nxmodmap -e 'remove mod4 = Super_L'\nxmodmap -e 'remove control = Control_L'\nxmodmap -e 'keycode 133 = Control_L'\nxmodmap -e 'add control = Control_L'\nxmodmap -e 'keycode 134 = Control_L'\nxmodmap -e 'remove mod4 = Control_L'\nxmodmap -e 'keycode 207 = Control_L'\nxmodmap -e 'remove mod4 = Control_L'\n\nNote that running \"xmodmap\" once on a file containing all of these commands did not work, for some reason. (Something which might point to a race condition between some ChromeOS keyboard driver weirdness and \"xmodmap\", which might mean that other systems might need \"sleep\" commands inserted in this script in auspicious places.)\nIn addition, if you are running Xfce as your desktop, and want to add this to the automatically started programs in the session settings, you should add a \"sleep X\" to the start of the file, where X = 3 worked for me, but I assume it could vary depending on the speed of your system and what other processes are run by Xfce at startup.\nBased on my experience, if this doesn't work, I suggest trying the following pseudo-code:\n<Do what you would ordinarily do to switch the keys>\nwhile \"xmodmap -pm\" shows that \"mod4\" includes keys:\n    for key in <keys assigned to mod4>:\n        xmodmap -e 'keycode <keycode(key)> = Control_L'\n        xmodmap -e 'remove mod4 = Control_L'\n\n(This obviously won't work if you want to have some key expressing \"mod4\".)\n\nA: On my Pixel the search key is defaulted to the Super key.

Taking snapshot of root partition will make possible to roll back to previous state. This is very helpful when something went wrong and/or data loss occurs. This feature can be seen in VirtualBox HDD and the persistence option in live CD. Unlike backup it uses incremental data usage thus less data size. Is it possible to take a snapshot of a file system?\n\nA: rsync\n\nTaking snapshot of root partition will make possible to roll back to previous state\n\nWe call that a backup procedure and for incremental backups you can use rsync ;)\n\nrsync is a utility software and network protocol for Unix-like systems (with ports to Windows) that synchronizes files and directories from one location to another while minimizing data transfer by using delta encoding when appropriate. Quoting the official website: \"rsync is a file transfer program for Unix systems. rsync uses the 'rsync algorithm' which provides a very fast method for bringing remote files into sync.\"3 An important feature of rsync not found in most similar programs/protocols is that the mirroring takes place with only one transmission in each direction.why? rsync can copy or display directory contents and copy files, optionally using compression and recursion.\n\nRemote Backup\nBackup over a network is possible, preferably the user should mount the network share to be backed up to prior to launching the program. The share would then be listed in the Browse GUI and could easily be added. There is no separate section for network, if more advanced features are required the user is encouraged to look at alternatives, of which there are many.\nGrsync\nGrsync is a graphical front end:\n\n\nMore information:\n\n*\n\n*https://help.ubuntu.com/community/rsync\nThe link has several examples on configuration.\nRsync allows you restore with a timestamp (so if have backups made every second you could also restore it to that second. Not that this is a workable method for a complete system ;-) )\n\nXen Hypervisor\nThere are more methods: Xen Hypervisor.\nYou could run all your operating systems in hypervisors (ie. virtual machines). Xen is an example of such a setup. Basically you turn ALL your operating systems into VMs and you can copy a VM container over to a new name and you would have a backup or restore point.\nFrom the link:\n\nXen is a type 1, bare-metal virtual machine monitor (or hypervisor), which provides the ability to run one or more operating system instances on the same physical machine. Xen, like other types of virtualization, is useful for many use cases such as server consolidation and isolation of production and development environments (e.g. corporate and personal environments on the same system).\nAs of Ubuntu 11.10 (Oneiric), the default kernel included in Ubuntu can be used directly with the Xen hypervisor as the management (or control) domain (Dom0 or Domain0 in Xen terminology).\nThe rest of this guide gives a basic overview of how to set up a basic Xen system and create simple guests. Our example uses LVM for virtual disks and network bridging for virtual network cards. It also assumes Xen 4.1 (the version available in 12.04) and the xend toolstack. It assumes a familiarity with general virtualization issues, as well as with the specific Xen terminology. Please see the Xen wiki for more information.\n\n\nLVM\nYet another method would be LVM\n\nLVM stands for Logical Volume Management. It is a system of managing logical volumes, or filesystems, that is much more advanced and flexible than the traditional method of partitioning a disk into one or more segments and formatting that partition with a filesystem.\nSnapshots\nThis is something you simply can not do without LVM. It allows you freeze an existing Logical Volume in time, at any moment, even while the system is running. You can continue to use the original volume normally, but the snapshot volume appears to be an image of the original, frozen in time at the moment you created it. You can use this to get a consistent filesystem image to back up, without shutting down the system. You can also use it to save the state of the system, so that you can later return to that state if you mess things up. You can even mount the snapshot volume and make changes to it, without affecting the original.\n\n\nrsnapshot\n\nrsnapshot iss a filesystem snapshot utility. It can take incremental snapshots of local and remote filesystems for any number of machines.\nLocal filesystem snapshots are handled with rsync. Secure remote connections are handled with rsync over ssh, while anonymous rsync connections simply use an rsync server. Both remote and local transfers depend on rsync.\n\nExample:\n[root@localhost /]# rsnapshot -v daily\necho 1842 > /var/run/rsnapshot.pid\n/bin/rm -rf /.snapshots/daily.6/\nmv /.snapshots/daily.5/ /.snapshots/daily.6/\nmv /.snapshots/daily.4/ /.snapshots/daily.5/\nmv /.snapshots/daily.3/ /.snapshots/daily.4/\nmv /.snapshots/daily.2/ /.snapshots/daily.3/\nmv /.snapshots/daily.1/ /.snapshots/daily.2/\nmv /.snapshots/daily.0/ /.snapshots/daily.1/\nmv /.snapshots/hourly.5/ /.snapshots/daily.0/\nrm -f /var/run/rsnapshot.pid\n[root@localhost /]#\n\n\nA: You can do this with LVM, but only if you set up your partitions to use LVM to begin with.\n\nA: What you really need is BTRFS\nhttp://www.linux.com/learn/tutorials/767683-how-to-create-and-manage-btrfs-snapshots-and-rollbacks-on-linux-part-2\nhttps://btrfs.wiki.kernel.org/index.php/Incremental_Backup\nhttp://www.dedoimedo.com/computers/btrfs-snapshots.html\n", "Q: Will Ubuntu work smoothly with these computer specifications? Mainly I want a Linux system for web developing.\nMy system has following specifications:\n\n\n*\n\n*Intel p4 2.66 GHz\n\n*500MB ram\n\n*160GB harddisk\n\n\nI heard that with removing some features during installation, we can use Ubuntu smoothly.\nSo which kind of features should I remove to accomplish this?\n\nA: 500 RAM is the issue here. Ubuntu by itself is not the problem, but the desktop environment Unity; so it is most advisable to use Lubuntu (which is the same Ubuntu, but with LXDE desktop). \nAt 1GB, I would use Xubuntu/Xfce, but, from my experience, Unity and KDE are fully comfortable only above that. \nMore on this here.\n\nA: Take a look at the requirements of Ubuntu\nhttps://help.ubuntu.com/community/Installation/SystemRequirements\nYour system meets the requirements, but in my experience it wont run smoothly - specialy the Unity Desktop will not.\nMaybe you can try a Ubuntu derivate like Kubuntu or Lubuntu. These need less ressources to work properly and smoothly.\n\nA: Actually, Unity desktop in Ubuntu will eat all your memory. To run anything will cost looooong swap times. If you can add the memory up to at least 2GB, then you can be fine. If you have low memory, you can help the performance by lower the swappines parameter (follow this question: How do I configure swappiness?). \nBetter you choose Xubuntu or Lubuntu with such configuration or increase amount of memory if you want to install Ubuntu+Unity. Option for Ubuntu could be to use Gnome classic or XFCE sessions.\nCPU is OK, it is not a hit of last years, but will run your system and some set of basic applications relatively smoothly. \nHDD - Ubuntu will take some 5-20G from your HDD, depend on set of app and the rest is for your Documents etc.\n", "Q: Resetting original display drivers When I first installed Ubuntu on my system, the display worked pretty much exactly how I wanted it to.

I want to install Xubuntu instead of Kubuntu. Can I do that without affecting my files at /home and is there any disadvantages of doing so?\n\nA: I disagree, you should be able to install xubuntu without formatting the /home partition. Very few, if any .files will conflict between kde and xfce.\nIt has been the default behavior of the Ubuntu installer (ubiquity) to preserve /home, with or without a separate partition, for quite some time, .\nhttps://wiki.ubuntu.com/UbiquityPreserveHome\n\nUbuntu now supports installations that preserve the /home directory when it already exists. To do this, manual partitioning must be used, and the partition on which data is to be preserved must not be marked for formatting. \n\nhttps://wiki.ubuntu.com/komputes/HowToUbuquityPreserveHome\nhttps://help.ubuntu.com/community/UbuntuReinstallation\n\nFew people know it, but since Hardy it's possible to reinstall Ubuntu without losing the content of the /home folder (which contains program settings, internet bookmarks, emails... and all the documents, music, videos that you have put in it). Even if /home is not on a separate partition (which is the case by default if you did not manually separate it). Remark: this tutorial can also be used to upgrade Ubuntu (eg 11.04 -> 12.04 from a 12.04 live-CD). \n\nThe general concept of backing up your data before you install an OS applies, but, you should have a backup already.\n\nA: When switching to another OS you have to take in account that this OS can (will?) have other names for hidden directories or files that store configuration files.\nA re-install with formatting /home is the proper method.\nAny other method might result in a system that has residual files from the old OS and you could potentially run into trouble when the new OS uses a file name that was kept from the old system. Permissions could prevent the current OS from updating a file.\nPossible pre installation options:\n\n\n*\n\n*Create a data partition where you store all your private files and no system files. Mount this data disc when setting up the new system and format all other partitions.\n\n*Create a new backup, format your system and install the new OS and restore your personal files from a backup.\n\n\n\nThe text starting with \"few people\" from bodi's post only should apply to Ubuntu as is says in the text. If you want to switch to another version of Ubuntu it can (not saying it will!) cause problems. Thing is: next person will assume that Mint is Ubuntu and oh is he in for a surprice. A big one. \nAnother example: let's assume you switch from a GDM/Unity based version to a KDE based version. You probably will end up with lots and lots of files not needed for KDE and owned by another users ID. Assume you create a new user for that new OS and it probably will not go as smooth as you would expect. It is asking for trouble. The -best- practice is a re-install with format.\nNo, I see lots of possible(!) problems. But ... of course you can always try and do a 2nd install (that way you get to learn more from installing).\n", "Q: Redirecting a locally mounted Windows SMB share (CIFS) to a Windows Terminal Server session I have been living in the Linux world only two months so far and have hit a problem with the above mentioned task, now explained in more detail:\nOur company has two Windows Terminal Servers to which the different clients connect from different branch offices. I have now tried to incorporate a Lubuntu 12.10 PC which is supposed to solely act as a Remote Desktop client.\nAs RDP-Client I am using freerdp (xfreerdp) which works like a charm, but when I try to access the redirected mounted windows share I get the following error:\nOpen Folder (Title)\n\\\\tsclient\\Office is not accessible. You might not have permission to use this network resource. Contact the administrator of this server to find out if you have access permissions.\n\nThe syntax I use for the connection:\nxfreerdp --sec rdp --no-nla --ignore-certificate -g 1680x1050 -f --plugin rdpdr --data printer:HPLJ5200_SMB:\"HP LaserJet 5\" --plugin rdpdr --data disk:Transfer:/home/apl03/Transfer --plugin rdpdr --data disk:Office:/media/Office -- 192.168.0.101\n\nAs you can see I am redirecting a printer and two folders. I can successfully print with the printer from the Windows terminal session, and I can access the folder /home/apl03/Transfer without any problems.\nAccessing the second folder, /media/Office, does not work.\n/media/Office is a share of the local file server of that branch office. The user apl03 has an account in the local Active Directory (AD) and file access from Lubuntu itself to the share works without any problems (read & write).\nThe share is mounted in /etc/fstab via:\n//192.168.1.1/OFFICE /media/Office cifs credentials=/home/apl03/.smbcredentials,file_mode=0777,dir_mode=0777 0 0\n\nThe permissions of /media/Office on the Lubuntu file system are as follows:\ndrwxrwxrwx   2 root root    0 Mär 27 15:26 Office\n\nIt may well be a permission issue but I don't know where else to look.

In both cases the folder shows up in the session, but on one client it's not accessible - just like in our company.\nFor the fun of it I tried \"rdesktop\" instead of \"freerdp\" and at least in my test setup everything seems to work with that. I will check if it's the same at work. If it is I guess this can be closed and attributed to a bug in \"freerdp\"\nFor reference, this is the equivalent rdesktop command I used:\nrdesktop -z -P -x m -a 16 -k de -g 1680x1050 -f -r disk:Transfer=/home/apl03/Transfer,Office=/media/Office 192.168.0.101\n\n\nA: You need to end all --plugin parts with -- so forexample \n--plugin rdpdr --data disk:Transfer:/home/apl03/Transfer\n\nbecomes\n--plugin rdpdr --data disk:Transfer:/home/apl03/Transfer --\n\nsee more here https://github.com/FreeRDP/FreeRDP/wiki/Plugins\n\nA: I still could not figure out why freerdp doesn't work on some clients. However, every client does work with rdesktop instead (see updates in original question). While it isn't a satisfactory solution for the original problem, using rdesktop is a workaround that meets all requirements.\nUnless somebody suggests otherwise I am considering this to be a bug with freerdp.\nThe command that I now ultimately use:\nrdesktop -z -P -x m -a 16 -k de -u \"\" -g 1680x1050 -f -r printer:HPLJ5200=\"HP LaserJet 5\" -r printer:Brother-MFC-8370DN=\"HP LaserJet 5\" -r disk:Transfer=/home/apl03/Transfer,Office=/media/Office 192.168.0.101\n\n\nA: I noticed that my folder redirection did not work if I was using the -g, but using the -f was working great.

I have libc6-i386 installed on my 64-bit capable Intel i3 processor. \nShould I rather install the amd64-versions of libc or stick to the i386 as I have an Intel processor?\n\nA: TL;DR: If you are running the 64-bit version of Ubuntu and you're invoking GCC as gcc (for C) or g++ (for C++), you need not be worried about the presence of libc-i386 on your system. A 64-bit system with a working compiler will produce binaries that link against the proper, 64-bit version of libc.\n\nDoes libc6-i386 compile 64-bit executables?\n\nlibc-i386 doesn't compile anything because it is not a compiler. The C compiler is gcc. Both libc binaries and libc header files are important but passive in the build process. Code is preprocessed, including information from the header files. It is compiled. It is linked to libc. libc is not doing any of this, your build tools--principally gcc (in the sense that that's the command you most frequently run to make these things happen)--do this.\nIf you are running the 64-bit version of Ubuntu and you have a C compiler installed, then you already have the necessary libraries and header files to compile and link programs against a 64-bit implementation of libc. My guess is that this is the situation you are in. Note that the presence of a 32-bit libc does not prevent the 64-bit libc from being used by default unless you are cross-compiling a 32-bit binary (which you would generally know you were doing, as it requires a bit of effort, and you would probably not be invoking gcc as gcc). Therefore, you need not be worried about the presence of libc-i386 on your system.\nIf you are running the 32-bit version of Ubuntu and you want to cross-compile 64-bit binaries, then you'll need something that provides the 64-bit version of libc as well as header files for it. (Header files provided officially in Ubuntu are provided by packages whose names end in -dev.) However, while 32-bit binaries can run on a 64-bit operating system, 64-bit binaries cannot run on a 32-bit operating system. So unless you really need to cross-compile, it's usually best to build 64-bit programs in a 64-bit operating system.\nGiven the small amount of information you've provided, it would be difficult to give an answer more specific to your situation.\n", "Q: Moving Ubuntu from one computer to another i have my laptop pc with Windows 7 and Ubuntu 12.10 as secondary OS.

I don't want to open the terminal and type sudo nautilus every time I want to visually browse for files. Is there a way of fixing it to the launcher?\n\nA: You can make a new menu entry with tools like alacarte (or manually write the .desktop file and place it in your ~/.local/share/applications folder) that runs \"gksudo nautilus\". gksudo should present you with a graphical password entry box. After you added this to your menu, you can just drag and drop it on the launcher. \n\nA: Just copy /usr/share/applications/nautilus.desktop to ~/.local/share/applications. Then edit all the \"command\" entries in it to begin with gksudo, also change all \"name\" entries to root nautilus, or something similar.

I would like to type Chinese in Emacs. I followed this link, and tried several input methods including chinese-py. It seems that, unlike normal IME of an operation system, it is not possible to type more than 1 character one time. We have to type character 1 by 1, this is not convenient at all.\nDoes anyone have a solution?\n\nA: You can use ibus with emacs (22 or higher) by installing ibus-el. \nibus-el  or sudo apt-get install ibus-el\nThere are instructions for setting it up at Ibus Mode. The instructions were written when ibus-el was still a PPA, but the rest of it holds. Slightly updated instructions are also installed to /usr/share/doc/ibus-el\nIf you have installed ibus-el, you can ignore most of the instructions. All you need to do is add the following lines to your ~/.emacs file:\n    (require 'ibus)\n    (add-hook 'after-init-hook 'ibus-mode-on)\n\nSomething not mentioned in the manual is that Ibus is not listed as in input method in Emacs even after installing ibus-el. So there's no need to bother with C-\\. Just use the Ibus indicator on the menubar to switch input methods like you would with any other application.\nAlso, Ibus won't see an available input window immediately after Emacs has started. If you try to switch to a Chinese input method at that point using the Ibus indicator on the menu bar, nothing will happen and you might think it's not working. But just click in your file before trying to switch the input method (letting Ibus see the available edit window) and then menu bar indicator and Ibus work as normal.\n\nA: I use fcitx.

I mostly access it by loading the Linux partition with a mapped vmdk in VirtualBox, but sometimes I do boot into it directly.\nI would like to move home to a separate partition. In order to back up this data along with the rest of my through Windows without a lot of fuss, I would like to have /home in a virtual disk. The problem is that when I boot directly into Linux, this virtual disk will not be available.\nWith the way I use things, not having the normal home data available when booting directly into Linux is not a problem, but I wasn't sure what Linux would do? Is it possible or advisable to create second /home partition that would be used for direct booting?\n\nA: You have created your virtual box definition incorrectly. Your best option is to create real partitions that way they are available to linux and the virtual machine. \nI would create a new real partition, add it to the vm, then copy the files over. Then use it for your home partition on both your vbox and your real boot.\nI personally use this setup quite a bit. I boot 90% of time in to linux but every once in a while I need Mac, when in Mac I use virtual box to access my linux box. \n\nA: I'd make Linux do the backup, it gives you a wide choice of tools: tar + gzip, git, nilfs, even dd for the paranoids.\nAlternatively, keep the files on a FAT or NTFS physical partition, which you mount under the Linux home. You can either mount the whole partition as a single directory, or mount the folders passing the option --bind to the mount command.\nThis allows both systems to access the files.

How can I fix it ? \n\nA: First of all that's nothing to worry about.  I would though agree with bodhi.zazen, in trying to clean the laptop.  I would recommend getting a can of compressed air, and try to clean the CPU fan.  Now according to Intel, that CPU, is rated at 105°C. See Here.  So 70°C to 90°C to is OK, and it should drop down once the CPU fan is cleaned.\n\nA: Unless the system shuts down, then it isn't overheating.  Those temperatures are normal when under load.\n\nA: In some cases fan speed is calculated at boot time, so try to wait the laptop to heat a bit, then restart it.\nThe fan speed will be, hopefully, recalculated and the problem solved, since the microprocessor is never too cold.\nI'm not joking, try it!\n\nA: *\n\n*Try installing the proprietary graphics driver.\nI had the same issue with the free drivers (some version of ubuntu ago), I saw great change after changing to the official (proprietary) drivers.\n\n\n*Cleaning the cooling system of your laptop will definitely really improve the situation. Dust and hair form a thick \"blanket\", not allowing the air pass. The laptop must be opened. Check if it is in warranty. If it is not, you may open it. Check for the service manual or relevant videos on YouTube.\n\nA: I had a toshiba with similar issues. What I discovered was that it wasn't always the cpu, but the gpu. You usually feel the heat on the left side of the hand rest area of the keyboard. After a LOT of research, I discovered that it was an issue with the DSDT - Toshiba doesnt generate their own for their laptops, so Microsoft ends up producing the DSDT file used on the system. I was able to rectify by decompiling the DSDT and making some manual changes to it and recompiling it, then, added it back to the linux boot loader and that fixed it.\nIf you want to, research DSDT files and their relationship to system hardware controls - especially regards to regulating the fan.\n", "Q: How to create a virtualenv with Python3.3 in Ubuntu?

For example, you can extend EnvBuilder to do pretty much whatever you want.  You can copy an example implementation of EnvBuilder from the link below and play around with it:\nhttp://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html#an-example-of-extending-envbuilder\nThat script above likely does most of what we expect to get out of virtualenv.  So if you just need a virtualenv with easy_install and pip, you should be good to go.\nSee @MarkOfSine's edits below for clarification on how to get running if you're still confused.\n\nTo add to the above, and as per docs:\nFor example, after executing: pyvenv-3.3 /path/to/my_project/venv\nYou can run distribute_setup.py, which seems to do various things, but essentially you end up with easy_install in your ./my_project/venv/bin directory.\nThis can then be used to install pip and the like.\nIt does not say where you should get distribute_setup.py from, so I downloaded from:  \nhttp://python-distribute.org/distribute_setup.py\n\nand using the activated environment:  \ncd /path/to/my_project\nsource venv/bin/activate\n\nran :\npython distribute_setup.py\n\nand  \neasy_install pip\n\nWhich then completed the setup of the virtual environment more inline with virtualenv on python 2.x\n\nA: It is easier than as it seems: \nvirtualenv -p /usr/bin/python3 yourenv\nsource yourenv/bin/activate\npip install package-name\n\nreally works :)\n\nA: *\n\n*Take backup of site-packages.\ncp -r /usr/local/lib/python2.7/site-packages/ /tmp/site-packages\n\n\n*Truncate that directory\nrm -rf /usr/local/lib/python2.7/site-packages/\n\n\n*Now try the same\nvirtualenv --no-site-packages --distribute -p /usr/bin/python3.3 ~/.virtualenvs/pywork3\n\n\n*To install without pip\nvirtualenv --no-site-packages --distribute -p /usr/bin/python3.3 ~/.virtualenvs/pywork3 --no-pip\nEDIT: Looks like the version of virtualenv (1.7.1.2) and python3.3 are not compatible.

This is accomplished for most values when using %g, but %g causes a few of the values to convert to scientific numbers, which i do not want.\nIs there a way to both print the numbers to the new file without the trailing zero's as well as not convert any numbers to scientific notation?\nExamples:\nWhen i apply the following to the file i am changing, using %f:\n(rline == 4) {printf(\"%f\\t %s\\n\",$1,\"gsurf_intercept\")}\n\nit results in:\n1000000.000000   gsurf_intercept\n\nwhen i use the %g option:\n(rline == 4) {printf(\"%g\\t %s\\n\",$1,\"gsurf_intercept\")}\n\nit results in:\n1e+06    gsurf_intercept\n\nwhat i want is:\n1000000     gsurf_intercept\n\nAlso, i applying this to 70 lines in the file i'm changing, and i would like the resulting file to produce two columns, each column in alignment. I find that not each item lines up with the one above or below - this happens when the item in the first column is a string and i use %s for it.\n\nA: You could convert the floating point to an integer number and print it.  There would be no trailing zeros and you could print with format code %d or %ld.\nI think that changing %f to %d might do the trick however w/o having to do the conversion explicitly (i.e. let printf do the conversion).\n", "Q: How website name get resolved?

With the new friends-app landing in Ubuntu, it occurred to me that adding support for Instagram in the timeline would be cool. I also thought I might take a stab at it myself, but I'm having a hard time finding any documentation.\nIs there a spec describing what is needed from each protocol? How does auth work? Would support need to be added to ubuntu-online-accounts first or is there a way for friends to register the new protocol?\nIt's very new and has a very hard to Google name, so any pointers in the right direction would be appreciated.\n\nA: Friends author here.\nIndeed, as you suspected, support is required in Ubuntu Online Accounts before support can be added to Friends. Friends architecture depends very heavily upon UOA in order to do all the authorization and manage all the API keys for us. My favorite example is LinkedIn, because it is so far the only protocol that was community contributed. The UOA plugin is mostly just two XML files, plus a little bit of autoconf trickery, which looks like this. (scroll down a bit for the diff, which clearly shows every single thing that needed to be added for LinkedIn to work).\nOnce you've done the same for your protocol, you need to propose the merge against lp:account-plugins and get Mardy to review, approve, and merge them. Once that is in place, you can begin to write the friends plugin, which will be written in Python 3.\nNow, one of the major, major improvements that Friends introduces over Gwibber is the use of subclasses. In the original Gwibber code, absolutely nothing was done with subclasses, so every new protocol plugin was a huge copy&paste hackjob of various bits of low-level functionality. When implementing Friends, I took great care to extract the common functionality into a superclass, which can be easily subclassed and modified. The superclass also has quite a lot of docstrings, which you should refer to when getting started. Unfortunately we haven't set up sphinx to publish those anywhere yet, so you'll just have to read the code for now.\nSome important things to keep in mind is that the name of your class has to match the \"providername\" used, case-insensitively. So if you defined the providername to be instagram, then you should create the file protocols/instagram.py, and name your Python class Instagram.\nThe two most important methods that you absolutely have to implement in order for your plugin to actually do anything, are called _whoami and receive. These are well documented in base.py (linked above), but basically the _whoami method will be called automatically, and passed in a dict that represents an already-parsed JSON blob that was given to us by the service when the authentication happened. If you're lucky, that dict will contain your Instagram username, user id, and display name, but if not you'll need to make a secondary API call in order to gather that information. Please see Facebook._whoami for an example of a protocol that didn't provide the information up front and required an additional API call from within the method, and see Twitter._whoami for an example of a protocol that gave us all the details we needed right up front. \nAfterwards, the receive method is responsible for making the API call that polls the service for new messages. This one is a little bit more free-form, because every REST API is slightly different, so you should refer to the website's API docs in order to figure out what exactly needs to be done here. In http.py we provide Uploader and Downloader classes that make it easy to make REST API calls, and can even parse JSON server responses for you. It's important to use these convenience classes because they wrap libsoup, which is configured to honour the GNOME proxy settings (you may recall how terrible Gwibber's proxy support always was, well we've fixed all that now). \nOnce you've got the API response from the server, you need to store it in our DeeModel (where Gwibber used a JSON blob dumped into an sqlite db for storing your messages, we're using a DeeModel, which is basically just a database that shares state across DBus, making it easy for multiple clients to display the message data easily). We call the act of storing a new message \"publishing\", and we provide a convenience method for it at Base._publish. Basically all you have to do is fill in the blanks here, make sure as much information as possible is filled into as many columns as possible. The possible arguments to _publish are defined in the schema, and again you can refer to the existing plugins to see how they do it.\nOnce you've gotten this far, you should have enough to be able to test it. We provide a couple tools in the tools directory to make it easy to run your code from within the source tree, so you don't have to install it to the system every time you want to make a change. What you should do is open one terminal, cd to the root of the source tree, and run ./tools/debug_slave.py. What that does is connects to the DeeModel, and just displays everything that happens to it, so you can see messages appearing live as they come in.

After installing Ubuntu I'm not able to see F:\\ G:\\ H:\\ partitions. \nDoes this mean I lost all data on F:\\ G:\\ H:\\ or is there any way to recover?\n\nA: Yes. You deleted windows, all your data is lost. Time to pull out your backup USB. Also F:\\ G:\\ H:\\ and drive labels like that are merely abstractions created by windows, (they don't exist in other OS'es) as Ubuntu may have left some of these partitions alone and only removed the main windows partition, they may still exist, open up the file manager and look in the side bar for anything without a name. (IE something that has just defaulted to saying the file system size). Also, no offence meant, but what else did you think \"erase windows 7\" meant?\n\nA: Yes. You have lost them.\nIf you are good at linux:\n 1. DO NOT USE UBUNTU YOU JUST INSTALLED! (Tmp files WILL overwrite WIN7)\n 2. Make a Knoppix live CD/USB/DVD/whatever.\n 3. Boot from it.\n 4.

I've been using Ubuntu for some time now but only after I got a new 5.1 speaker system, has this began to create a problem.\nI am using an ASRock N68C-GS UCC Motherboard with on-board audio and faced a similar issue on Windows 7. The drivers that came with the motherboard only supported stereo sound, as the rear jacks are only Speakers, Line-in and Mic. I somehow managed to download and install a different set of drivers from VIA audio.\nI could find a solution to this on Ubuntu however. I'm currently running a Daily Build of 13.04.\nIn the sound setting, selecting Analogue Surround 5.1 Output changes nothing as the 2 other jack are still recognised and rear mic and line-in in the input section.\n\nA: From my understanding, you need to have the correct connections on your sound device first (ex. 4 or 5 outputs that correspond to each speaker). Otherwise, you are just emulating the surround. I do not think you can tell 'mic' or 'line-in' to output sound, as they are not designed to do this.\nThis may give you more info - Using microphone input port as headphone output\n", "Q: Unable to activate MATLAB I have a Problem with the Matlab (2012a Student Version) Activation.

To me, it looks like swap wasn't enabled on this but it's been a VERY long time since I've had to do things like this. It's a rails app and the only reason this came up is because we were getting out of memory errors. Is a swap partition still considered a best practice for a modern (3.2.13 rails app)? I'd imagine so. Is there a simple fix to creating a swap partition from the command line (host has 2GB of RAM)? Not asking to do it but some guidance would be appreciated.  \nI'm fine with just upgrading to a 1GB of memory server which is only $5 / month more.\n\ndeploy@x1:~$ sudo fdisk -l\n\nDisk /dev/sda: 42.9 GB, 42949672960 bytes 255 heads, 63 sectors/track,\n5221 cylinders, total 83886080 sectors Units = sectors of 1 * 512 =\n512 bytes Sector size (logical/physical): 512 bytes / 512 bytes I/O\nsize (minimum/optimal): 512 bytes / 512 bytes Disk identifier: 0x00000000\n\nDisk /dev/sda doesn't contain a valid partition table  \ndeploy@x1:~$ \n\nAlos should I be concerned about the last line regarding not containing a valid partition table?\n\nA: You can always check if swap is enabled by running:\nswapon -s\n\n(See man swapon for details.)\nThis lists all swaps that are currently enabled. If you run that and get no output, swap is not enabled. Most of the time an Ubuntu system will have a single swap partition and no swap files enabled; that will look something like this:\nek@Kip:~$ swapon -s\nFilename                Type        Size            Used         Priority\n/dev/sda7               partition   4194300         1499712     -1\n\nAs for sudo fdisk -l telling you that Disk /dev/sda doesn't contain a valid partition table: no, that is usually not cause for concern. (In particular, it doesn't mean no swap is enabled.)\nfdisk doesn't support some constructs--it will not recognize a disk that use LVM or software RAID (md) as having a valid partition table. LVM is very common on servers. When you see this warning from fdisk -l, run parted -l instead:\nsudo parted -l\n\nparted is more likely to be able to identify and report on such constructs.\n", "Q: Ubuntu server reporting difference disk capacity than Virtualbox Need help figuring out why Ubuntu is mis-reporting disk capacity on a VM. Just installed Ubuntu 12.04 Server LTS 64 bit on a Virtualbox (version 4.2.10) virtual machine. I also installed the Ubuntu desktop on this server.\nI created the virtual disk (VDI option) as 8GB with the Dynamically allocated option. Virtualbox currently reports the actual size at 1.7GB\n\nThe Ubuntu Disk Usage Analyzer shows the drive has a total capacity of 4.2GB which makes no sense.\n\nI pulled this info from the command line and it doesn't match the GUI report. It adds up to just under 8GB which is right. I'm unclear about why \"udev\" and \"tmpfs\" both are allocated at 2GB since this a new install.\n\nI installed GParted and it shows the extended partition correctly to be be 7.6GB.\n\nSo why is the Gui misreporting drive capacity and how do I fix this? I can't install anything else because I'm getting warnings in the desktop about there only being 25MB of space left. I already ran 'sudo apt-get clean' and it did nothing. I also tried resizing the VDI disk itself from the my hosts command line but an error:\nc:\\VBoxManage modifyhd ozzman2.vdi --resize 20000\n0%...\nProgress state: VBOX_E_NOT_SUPPORTED\nVBoxManage.exe: error: Resize hard disk operation for this format is not implemented yet!\n\n\nA: You have 4GB space used as virtual memory aka swap.\nYou will probably want to assign more disk for storage.  There are a couple of choices but the simplest and most expedient is usually to recreate the installation with a larger size.  Alternatives include:\n\n\n*\n\n*Resize the disk within VirtualBox, extend the physical extent, then the logical extend, then the ext4 file system afterwards.\n\n*Add a new disk to the virtual host and add that to LVM as a new physical volume and extend the root logical volume to use that space, subsequently extend the ext4 file system to use the new space.\n\n*Add a new disk and mount somewhere new e.g. /opt and use that as desired.\n\n\nRandom article on Google that may assist:\nhttp://www.joomlaworks.net/blog/item/168-resizing-the-disk-space-on-ubuntu-server-vms\n\nA: Of course, the 1.7 GBytes is the actual size on the underlying physical disk that is allocated.\nThe virtual host assumes that the full amount is present, but the underlying Hypervisor will create the necessary storage as needed.  If you are wondering where your disk allocation has gone, I'd use fdisk and check the size of each partition.  \nIn the case of LVM, it may be that some of the physical volume although allocated is not in a Logical volume yet.  Look at vgdisplay -v /dev/ubuntu1.  You'll probably see some unallocated Extents that could be allocated to the root logical volume or to another LV altogether. (ubuntu1 seems to be the volume group name, and in your display root is the logical volume residing within that volume group).\n", "Q: Web page goes black after it is done loading on Chrome Does anybody else have this?

I dual boot with windows xp and ubuntu 12.04 lts. I rarely use windows. I want to remove the windows entry from grub menu. I don't want to remove windows, i just want to remove the entry.\nThe purpose is other users should not log into windows. These other users are non-tech savy and they bring malware. Asking them to boot into ubuntu is not helping. All they use is web browser. So removing the entry will make them unable to boot into windows. Better still they might assume windows is removed.

I use windows for testing hardware issues or IE only sites and other weird situation to confirm my idea on what went wrong.\n\nA: grub-customizer can do this for you.\nIt can even totally hide grub from showing until you set the option back.

I use truecrypt to encrypt one of my drives and I would want to leave the computer running processes that use information of that drive while I'm not home, I've tried suspending it but everything stops, I've also tried logging out but all processes are closed.\nSo is locking the computer (Ctrl+Alt+:L) the only possibility of achieving what I want?\n\nA: \nIs locking the computer (Ctrl+Alt+L) the only possibility of achieving what I want?\n\nNo. Services will still be active when you log out. So you could rewrite those processes to run as a service (if not already available). Or create a script that does what you want to do and include that as a service or crontab job. \nI would expect the encryption to be re-actived when you log out(?) \n\nSecond: Is the lock screen secure enough to prevent \"Mallory\" from accessing the encrypted drive? \n\nWell... nothing is secure if someone can physically access your machine. What is preventing someone to reboot the machine by cutting of the power and boot with a live cd and just format your disc?  \nTo make things worse: there is probably a way to circumvent the lock screen. Also reported here. I have not seen a fix for debian/ubuntu so you might want to test if it is possible to do on your machine.\n\nA: It depends on technical knowledge of your adversary.\nIn theory nothing will help you if a violator has physical access to your computer and really wants to steal your data.\nFor example he can reboot your system in single user mode with root privileges.\nYou can disable single user mode but he can use live cd or a kind of hack to reset root password.\nTo protect from booting from live cd you can setup BIOS password (for boot and for settings access), but that also can be bypassed by CMOS data clearing and restoring default BIOS settings.\nIn addition your system can have running services listening some ports. They also can be vulnerable.\nThen he can install special software he need, for example key logger for catching your password and accessing encrypted files/folders/drives.\nSo the more protection steps you did, the more difficult it can be to get access (more time and higher skills are required). But that is still not impossible.\nYou can hide your data (if not done yet) in addition to encryption.\n\nA: As far as defeating the encryption on an otherwise locked down machine, look up the liquid nitrogen RAM attacks. It's always a question of how secure you want to be, not being undefeatable. If an attacker needs a dewer of LN on hand to defeat you, you're fairly likely to see him coming.\n", "Q: I Recently Installed Ubuntu Desktop GUI Over My Ubuntu Server Install and I Broke Some Bash Commands I have been running a virtualbox of Ubuntu Server for web development and have been getting along quite nicely.

The partitions are very small but just shouldn't be there. I think they are remnants from old linux installations.  Any help on cleaning this up would be appreciated.\n\nA: Those little gaps of unused space on your HDD could be because you used a Windows partition program at some point; Windows partition editors often use different HDD geometries than the standard that Linux uses, and because partitions typically end and start at cylinder boundaries, you can end up with little gaps of unused space if you use a Windows partition editor and Linux partition editor on the same drive.\nI would suggest leaving them as is. If you have Windows on your sda1 NTFS partition, and if you try to move the beginning of that partition to claim the 1 MB of unallocated space at the beginning of the drive, doing that will make Windows unbootable. Source.\n\nIf you do want to get rid of these you probably need to umount the partition next to it and use the \"round to cylinder\" option in gparted:\n\n\nA: If it is Unallocated it would mean it is blank space with no partition in it at, which means you just need to expand a current partition to use up that space if you want it.\n", "Q: WPS Kingsoft not running Installed WPS Kingsoft on my Ubuntu 12.10 64bit from a .deb package downloaded from omgubuntu but when I execute any for the three files (writer, spreadsheet or powerpoint) nothing happens.\nAnyone has a workaround for this?\n\nA: I had experienced the same problem running 32bit version of Kingsoft over a 64bit system.

The fan is always at like 60 % power , decreases 1 min then again it start to 60 %. It is not a laptop issue , isnt dirty with dust inside , ive just cleaned out, and in windows the temperatures are as expected , 40 idle , 80 full throttle. And as far as i know , an Ubuntu working laptop should be less heated then a windows one , if both are fresh installs. I think it is something from the APU with 7670m video card. Laptop spec - AMD A6 3420m, 4 GB ram , 6520g+7670m video card. Hope you can understand my issue even my english isnt too good. Good luck everyone , and great job !\n\nA: dude this is normal due to reason that when you install ubuntu on AMD apu it's by default use opensource x.org driver. So it uses maximum pontential of cpu. Your cpu is capable of boosting it's frequency to 2.4GHz and base clock is 1.5GHz.\ndue to these drivers cpu run always at 2.4GHz. To avoid this issue you have to install AMD proprietary driver using additional drivers menu in ubuntu and you can use indicator-cpufreq to control cpufrequency\nTo install it just type in terminal \n\nsudo apt-get install indicator-cpufreq\n\nand after that using it you can use ondemand cpu governer. That will solve you issue. and second thing you say that your cpu cooling fan run for while and then stops for 1 minute, perhaps this is due to your BIOS settings. In BIOS there is setting called fan always on you set it off. so it stops for a while and then starts again.\nTo monitor cpu temperature you can use Psensor. You can install it using ubuntu software center.\n", "Q: How to remove file logicaly?

I have a Realtek RTL8188CE 802.11b/g/n on my Quantal amd64 system. I installed the kernel modules for that card and modprobe that module. I can only view to the 2.4GHz WLANs. The module Im talking about was downloaded from the realtek page.\nHere is some good info. Well my configuration.\n\nA: Not all N cards support 5GHz.  This one doesn't.\nA clue is the fact that it is labelled with B and G but not A.  Of the standards older than N, B and G both used the 2.4GHz band while A used the 5GHz band.  N cards supporting both bands are often labeled as supporting A/B/G/N, whereas N cards supporting only 2.4GHz are often labeled as B/G/N.\nThe newer standard AC also uses the 5GHz band.  Only N supports both bands, with mandatory 2.4GHz support and optional 5GHz support.  So if a device supports AC and N that should mean it supports N on both bands.\n\nA: The Realtek RTL8188CE WLAN adapter is designed to connect to a IEEE 802.11b/g/n communication protocol. This protocol is available for both the 2.4, and the 5.0 GHz frequency band. However according to the hardware specifications this adapter like many other \"802.11n\" adapters only supports the 2.4 GHz band:\n\n  \n*\n  \n*Complete 802.11n solution for 2.4GHz band Realtek\n\nTo be able to connect to signals in the 5.0 GHz band you need to have an adapter supporting this.

In Ubuntu 12.10, I've created an LXC of type 'ubuntu' using the lxc-create utility. I then create ephemeral containers based on this container using the lxc-start-ephemeral utility, and I need to connect to those using password-less ssh. However, I need to keep their /home/ubuntu folders pristine, so I can't put the usual .ssh/authorized_keys file in there.\nThe 'encrypted home directory' section here tells me how to move authorized_keys out of the home directory. After I follow those instructions from inside the base container, I can ssh into the base container without giving a password.\nHowever, when I launch an ephemeral container from the base container, I can't ssh in without a password.

This seems to be a long-standing Ubuntu problem, I've experienced it since years ago if I remember correctly.\nI have language support for both Chinese and Japanese installed (and want to keep it that way -- I do know though that the problem can be \"resolved\" by uninstalling Chinese fonts, I have experimented with that). The problem is that Japanese text shows as Chinese glyphs. Not for every single Japanese character, but presumably for ones that the system thinks has a corresponding glyph in Chinese.\nThis happens in all applications: libreoffice, browsers, gedit, terminal etc.\n(This problem is not about input methods.)\nFonts installed:\nChinese (and Japanese)\nfonts-arphic-ukai\nfont-arphic-uming\nttf-wqy-microhei\nttf-wqy-zenhei\nJapanese\nfonts-takao-gothic\nfonts-takao-mincho\nfonts-takao-pgothic\nOthers that seem to support Japanese/Chinese\nfonts-droid\nSteps to reproduce: Install fonts/support for both Japanese and Chinese, and then type Japanese character. You need to be able to recognize differences between glyphs from the two languages to see this problem.\nExamples: 誤り、直す\n(Will upload pictures.)\n\nA: Were the encoding is UTF-8, applications will chose the first font capable of displaying that character. By default it goes in alphabetical order. So if you have both Chinese and Japanese fonts installed, you might end up with glyphs you don't want. \nYou can select the order that applications will select the fonts by editing your ~/.fonts.conf file. Though if you move Japanese in front of Chines you might end up reversing the problem.\n\nA: This is not an Ubuntu problem (or a problem with any operating system), but stems from the way Unicode is designed. Unicode uses a unified database for CJK characters called Unihan. A character (single Unicode code point) may be represented by different glyphs in different writing traditions. \nThe issue of the glyph used by the screen/printer/browser for a given character (code point) is a result of the way different fonts map the same Unicode character to different glyphs. \nThe solution is to as much as possible use a specific font made for each language, keeping in mind that shared or web docs will render glyphs according to the local configuration. In short, it's the Unicode code point in the doc itself that matters not the glyph on the screen. \nIf you really need to make sure a specific glyph is used, you will need to have a way to lock in or embed the needed font in your document or app.\nFrom the Unicode FAQ:\nThe Unicode standard is designed to encode characters, not glyphs...\nIn the overwhelming majority of cases where a Han character is written differently in different locales, readers from one locale would recognize the form used in another; in all cases, experts from throughout East Asia would recognize the fundamental unity of the character...\nThere are occasional instances of unified characters whose typical Chinese glyph and typical Japanese glyph are distinct enough that the Chinese glyph will be unfamiliar to the typical Japanese reader, e.g., 直 U+76F4. To prevent legibility problems for Japanese readers, it is advisable to use a Japanese-style font when presenting Unihan text to Japanese readers. \nHan Unification is designed to preserve legibility. Documents typically can be simply displayed in the font preferred by the user. Where a distinction in style needs to be made (for example, Chinese-style vs. Japanese-style glyphs in the same document), appropriate fonts should be applied to the specific text as needed.\nBecause of limitations in existing fonts, it may occasionally happen that a rare kanji will be displayed using a Chinese-style glyph where a Japanese-style glyph would be preferred. This is a font issue, not a character encoding issue, and the same problem can occur with other character encoding standards.\n", "Q: How can I redirect keyboard input (stdin) to audio device?

The other day I noticed when I wanted to seed a file for an older torrent, that the file size was wrong on my computer.  The torrent said the file was say 450 mb, but when I went to look for the file, it was listed as say 480 mb! Bigger by maybe 10%.\nThis was just weird, but turned out to be a big pain in the butt because I made a vdi file for virtualbox at a fixed size of 15.8 gigs, and now it is listed as 17 gigs on Ubuntu!  Which means I can't put it on the 16 gig memory stick I have!\n(And yes, the memory stick has enough room for 15.8 gigs on it, in case anyone is wondering)\nSo, this is not the end of the world, I just have to buy a 32 gig stick now, but I am like WTF you know??  What gives as the kids say.\nAll other sources of information are consistent, and therefore Ubuntu is wrong. The website says the file is 450, the torrent file and the torrent client all say the file is 450. Virtualbox says the file is actually 15.8 gigs, it even handily provides an \"actual size\" value which says...15.8 gigs!\nOnly Ubuntu is giving these larger numbers. Therefore Ubuntu is wrong. \nWhy, dear goddess why??\n\nA: You need to be careful with dealing with file/disk sizes. Some systems/applications/advertisements use a base-10 measurement (so 1 K bytes is 1000 bytes) whereas others use a base-2 like system (so 1 K bytes is 1024 bytes) and some use a weird mixture ( 1 K is 1024 bytes but 1 M is 1024000).\nSee http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mebibyte\n", "Q: Fastest Net Card Option in Virtualbox with Ubuntu I'm using a Mac Air with Virtualbox and Ubuntu 10.04. On the Network Adapter options, which setting is the fastest? Also, what are these settings used for, or their advantages and disadvantages?\n\n\n*\n\n*NAT\n\n*Bridged Adapter\n\n*Internal Network\n\n*Host-only Adapter\n\n*Generic Driver\n\n\nA: These all behave very differently -- I don't think you should choose one over another because of speed. I suggest you use NAT. This will make your VM look like just another application on your host machine. The other possibility is Bridged Adapter, but that will require the VM to acquire it's own IP address which may be a problem in some environments.\n\nA: The bridged adapter is fastest because it doesn't use the TCP/IP stack of the local computer host OS and goes direct to the net card, sharing your net card on the same computer, but using two different MAC addresses. Your NAT router from your cable or DSL modem will automatically give this adapter a separate IP address on DHCP.\nReally the only other practical choice for doing work in the VM is the NAT Adapter, but then that means your OS is sharing its TCP/IP stack, which potentially could slow down the net connection. However, when I ran a test here at my house with both Bridged and NAT, going to speedtest.net and fast.com, the stats were identical. So, it's worth a test in your environment.\nI want to add that in some hotel networks, you can't easily use the Bridged Adapter mode for some reason.

I'm running a windows 8 that I had upgraded form 7, so it wouldn't be a secure boot if I'm correct on that since it wasn't preinstalled. Most of what I am coming across talks about using a preinstalled Windows 8 so I wanted to make sure this won't cause me any problems installing it as normal.\nThe other problem I'm running into is everything I am finding talks about installing on a UEFI enabled system, and I'm running a legacy bios at the moment. Is that going to cause a problem? If so, is there a way I can make my machine a UEFI enabled system so that i don't run into these problems?\nThe computer I have is a Dell Inspiron N5040 laptop if that is needed, and if necessary I can give you whatever specs you may need.\nIf you need any more information from me on my machine or anything, just let me know\nI've possible, I'd also like to know how I would go about removing Ubuntu if I decide I don't like it (though I doubt that would be the case) or if I for some reason can't get it to work. I've found some guides that require the original windows CD but I don't have that, and I've found some about using EasyBCD but from what I've seen it doesn't have a Windows 8 option.\n\nA: There won't be any problem.\nGo ahead, create partition and install Ubuntu on that partition.\nIf you have hybrid graphics (intel + nvidia) you may need to install bumblebee. However latest nvidia driver beta now support optimus (not to full extent though). \nFor removing Ubuntu, yes you need to restore mbr. So Windows dvd will be best option.\nOr you can use Boot-Repair or OS-uninstaller.\n\nA: I agree with Web-E answer, but here are some additional thoughts:\n\nI'm running a legacy bios at the moment. Is that going to cause a problem? If so, is there a way I can make my machine a UEFI enabled system so that i don't run into these problems?\n\nIf Windows is installed in Legacy (non-UEFI) mode, then it will not cause any problem. It's even easier for Windows/Ubuntu dual-boot, because you will avoid all UEFI potential problems. So, do NOT try to change your partitioning to UEFI.\n", "Q: 12.04 LTS and nvidia-current don't work Recently, an automatic security update upgraded my Nvidia driver to \"version current\".

Does this scanner work with Ubuntu, or Linux in general?\n\nA: YES\nThis scanner does work with Ubuntu with sane/xsane out of the box.\nOld backstory (when the ix500 was just released)\nThe SANE team got it working by hacking up a backend for the ix500. It currently only provides color scans at the driver level (gray and B&W are done in software). Pull down the sane-backend project from the git repo, compile it, and install. There may be a few permission problems, but as root, I can run simple-scan and get everything I want out of it.\nThis device prides itself on wireless however the wireless only works with Android and the iPhone, and to make matters even worse configuring the device to connect to the WiFi access point requires Windows or MacOS.\nYou won't get your full value out of this scanner with Linux. That's because Fujitsu doesn't fund or endorse the SANE project (their loss, and our loss). That said, it'll work to some degree.\n\nA: It’s Feb 2023 and via usb connection the ScanSnap IX500 shows up by default in Ubuntu 22.04.

Apologies for any stupid questions as I am an Ubuntu newbie (an impressed one, for sure!).\nI have installed Ubuntu alongside Windows 7 using wubi. Before doing so, I however did not create a separate partition on my hard drive. My hard drive has a single partition i.e., C: which had a Windows 7 installation and I installed Ubuntu in the same partition. I have a few questions around this:\n\n\n*\n\n*First of all, can there be any issues with the way I have installed Ubuntu i.e., in the same partition as Windows? If so, what are they? Is it recommended that I move the Ubuntu installation into another separate partition? If not, the rest of my questions are kind of irrelevant, but it might still be helpful to get the answers for the same for my understanding.\n\n*How safe is it to create a new partition from Windows disk manager without adversely affecting my system including my Ubuntu installation? I would think it should be safe, but I have scorched my hands earlier with partitions and don't want to jump into it without expert advice.\n\n*From what I have read on the forums, it looks like directly moving the Ubuntu installation to the newly created partition is not going to be possible. Am I right?\n\n*If I have to uninstall Ubuntu and re-install it again into the new partition (I am ok to do this for at the moment, I have not had the Ubuntu installation even for a month and there is no data I have created in it and not many programs installed yet), I understand that I have to use a program like EasyBCD to overwrite the boot record from Windows and then delete the Ubuntu partitions from Windows disk manager. Before I do that, I wanted to check if I could see the Ubuntu partitions from Windows disk manager, but I can't. How will I be able to delete them then or uninstall Ubuntu?!\nThanks for your help!\n\nA: When installing using wubi the filesystem is just a file in your windows C: drive. You can use some tools to mount this in windows. Wubi is only meant to test Ubuntu and isn't good as a long term solution. So your best bet is to back up any user data onto a USB and remove wubi from add and remove programs in windows. This will unintall ubuntu. Then download the ubuntu .iso image, and write it to a usb or dvd, and use that to install properly to a separate partition. Don't try and do any partitioning yourself, the installer can manage it for you if you select install alongside windows 7.\n", "Q: Wubi Migration: Grub does not boot I migrated from a wubi install on a SSD (dev/sda), with the virtual disk on a separate drive (/dev/sdb), to a brand new partition on the separate drive\nI recall during me running the wubi-move script, it stated that the bootloader and grub2 were being installed to dev/sdb. I migrated root and the swap to dev/sdb4 and dev/sdb5 respectively.\nBut when the computer boots, it continues to show the Windows Boot Manager, not the new Grub as I expect, and I am not sure how to resolve my issue. I can see that the migration was successful, so I am thinking there are probably many possible solutions. Can I just reinstall grub2 or something of that nature?\nIf possible, I would rather have grub boot first, and be able to remove the Wubi install from within windows to the original mounting point which was a 30 gig spot on dev/sdb1. \n\nA: If you're having an issue e.g. Windows still boots first, not Ubuntu, then it is likely that you are still booting from your SSD drive (/dev/sda), not the drive with the migrated install on it (/dev/sdb).\nSince you migrated to a different drive from the one you currently boot on, it is normal that Windows continues to boot. The Wubi migration script is intentionally limited as to where it can install Grub - for safety purposes (and to keep things simple). If you need to change the drive boot order or boot from a different disk, this has to be done separately.\nFor example, if you don't want the drive boot order, and instead you want Grub in /dev/sda you can boot the migrated install (it's always available on the bottom of the Wubi Grub menu after migrating) and then install Grub to /dev/sda:\nsudo grub-install /dev/sda\n\n", "Q: What's the difference between 'sudo [command]' and 'sudo sh [command]? I'm trying to install VMware Workstation in my Ubuntu 12.04.2 LTS.\nIf I execute the following command:\nsudo ./VMware-Workstation-9.0.1-894247.x86_64.bundle\n\nit finishes at once and the installation never starts.\nIf I execute this command:\nsudo sh ./VMware-Workstation-9.0.1-894247.x86_64.bundle\n\nThe installer can be launched successfully.\nWhy does this make a difference?\n\nA: If the file is not marked as executable you need to call a command shell interpreter to execute it.\nExamples:\n\n\n*\n\n*sudo sh foo will open foo with sh using sudo privileges.\n\n*sudo bash foo will open foo with bash using sudo privileges.\n\n*sh foo will open foo with sh using your user's privileges.\n\n*bash foo will open foo with bash using your user's privileges.\nIf you mark a file as executable you just need to call it with ./foo and because it is marked as such it will be read with the defined command shell interpreter and executed without the need to define one.\nls -F will list files and mark executables with *.\nTo enable the execute bit on a file (and make it executable as such) use the command chmod +x foo.\nIn your case to make the file you are using executable you would then use the command \nchmod +x VMware-Workstation-9.0.1-894247.x86_64.bundle\nand then you will be able to run it with either\nsudo sh ./VMware-Workstation-9.0.1-894247.x86_64.bundle or just by typing sudo ./VMware-Workstation-9.0.1-894247.x86_64.bundle.\n\nA: Sh is a shell for running commands, so executing sh with sudo gives you a root shell. This means all commands in that shell are executed as root. My guess is that script executes something else that needs root, however when you only use sudo not sudo sh, that something else gets executed as a normal user, however with sh everything will be executed as root.\n\nA: sudo is a command that give you root privilege. But sh is an interpreter. When you use sudo command, you running the command as root privilege. But when you use sudo sh command, you running the sh command as root.\n", "Q: Why can't we remove bluetooth service the reguler way?

I have a Laptop with 1TB hard disk space. I can allocate 100GB for Ubuntu. Currently there is only Windows 7 installed.

There are further technical explanations for the swap space but i think they will not help you at the current task.\nUsually if there is enough disk space, the size of the swap partition is recommended to be equal to the size of the RAM, i.e for a system with 1 GB RAM, 1 GB of swap is ok.\nFor details about swap you can check the swap faq\nlastly one good guide with screenshots can be found here: How to install Windows 7 and Ubuntu side by side which claims to be up to date with Windows 8.\n\nA: \nSo what should I do now? \n\nStick a live cd in your cd player and reboot. Let it boot the cd and you will get a prompt asking to install Ubuntu.\n\nIn how many partitions should I divide that space & what conventions should be followed. Should I do this in the Ubuntu installer or should I do all this before installing Ubuntu?\n\n\n\n*\n\n*Use the installer, and when it comes to partitioning choose  the bottom one (the image will look different when you have another OS but it will still be the bottom one): \n\n\n\n\n\n*\n\n*You need at least 1 partition and it has to be named /. Format it as ext4. 20 or 25Gb is more than enough if you use another partition for home and/or data.\n\n*You can also create a swap. Between 2 and 4 Gb is enough for newer system. \n\n*You can create other partitions for /home or /boot but that is not required. Format it as ext4\nLots of people have lots of ideas when it comes to partitioning. \nThe exact steps are shown in this (official) how to:\nhttp://www.ubuntu.com/download/help/install-desktop-latest\n\nA: If you are new to Ubuntu - don't bother. Just leave some unallocated, unpartitioned space to the Ubuntu, and installer will ask what you want to achieve:\n\n\nAdvanced partitioning is an option only if you know what you're doing. For example, having or not having swap partition, isolating home partition, can give some benefits, but for Linux newbies this is totally useless :)\n\nA: I use three partitions for linux, system (/), home(/home) and swap using ext4, if you won't install many programs maybe you can give 20GB to System (/), now we need to create a extended partition where we will two partitions, after, check your RAM, example, my RAM y 4GB then I give 8GB to SWAP, the next step, is create the partition for home(/home), this is using the space unallocated in the extended partition. You can see this diagram to understand:\n**Partitions LINUX**\n\nHardDisk/\n    -> System (mount point / ) [20GB]\n    -> Extended Partition [80GB]\n        -> Swap [4GB RAM x 2 = 8GB]\n        -> Home (mount point /home ) [72GB]\n\nThis is only example to ilustrate.\n", "Q: Sometimes, Ubuntu does not boot I have been having a problem with Ubuntu ever since I installed it. I have no clue why it is doing it, but I will try to provide as much detail as possible. First, I want to say that I am duel-booting with windows 7. Secondly, this is not the only time this has happened (I think it might be because of Ubuntu 12.10 because it never \"not booted\" when I used Ubuntu 12.04), but instead, this was with another PC. This is very strange to me because I have two laptops and one desktop (I’m using the desktop which has the boot problems), and this is strange because I INSTALLED Ubuntu on a fairly old laptop and I duel booted with the good one...the good one booted like, 1/4 times while the old laptop booted 100% of the times. Now, I don’t know if this is because I'm duel booting or not but it is still, very unclear to me.\nNow, onto what happens on screen. I’m sure that some of you out there would know what the duel booting screen looks like, it has that purple background with the white text (including the booting options). Now when I select the Ubuntu booting option, it stays on the same screen for a couple of seconds, then, it cuts to a purple screen for approx...10 seconds. after those couple of seconds, a semi-error screen will pop up (this is nothing but a cluster of black lines and other colors of the rainbow(this would last for about 1.3 seconds)). Then (this is path 1), a black screen this time with the text:\n                          [ok]\n\n_\nNote that the '_' will continue to flash, might I add that the mouse is highly visible on the screen and is movable (what I think this means is that I’m on the desktop but nothing is visible. And now path 2. now, path 2 consists of another black screen but no text is visible, only the mouse is.\nOK, now onto what happens when it does work. Everything is normal (except for everything being slow, but I think its best that we work out this issue first), now what do I mean by normal? Imagine a video showing you \"what to do after installing Ubuntu\", it looks just like that. no UI screwing up or even problems updating, just everything being...good.\nBTW if anyone wants to know the specs for this PC, there right here.

You can download kubuntu from http://www.kubuntu.org/getkubuntu and copy the image into a USB or CD, boot a computer and use the installator, just exactly as you would do with a regular ubuntu image.\nThe difference (and the good thing of installing it) is that it comes with full KDE experience (KDE plasma, desktop and apps) and without unity nor gtk apps. This method has the following key advantages (in my opinion):\n\n\n*\n\n*Coherent KDE experience (if you install KDE on top of unity you may see light DM for login instead of lightkdm, or your default apps will be ubuntu's instead of KDE's, for example)\n\n*You won't have any duplicate apps (if you install KDE on top of unity you will have nautilus and dolphin as filemanagers, empathy and telepathy as IM clients -in my experience they don't seem to get on well together- and so on) and you will save some space and remove redundancy.\n\n*And of course no need to \"waste\" time in intermediate steps which are not necessary.\n\n", "Q: Why my Ubuntu 12.10 can't recognize Canon IP1980?

Simplest way to fix this would be to boot into a livecd and undo it.Alternately, if booting into a livecd sounds like too much work you'll want to boot into single user mode (so you're root) and do the same thing.\nTo undo it, you simply need to go into your home directory from the other install, and remove it from your .bashrc, or better yet, work out from bashrc where astley.sh is now, and delete it (which is safer, since then you can edit bashrc from your own account, which avoids the risk of accidentally changing ownership to someone else)\nAnd the next time you decide to do something this silly, have a backup account (and add it to sudoers) to fix this.\n\nA: Its all right now because I reinstalled Ubuntu.\nAlso,Journeyman Geek I’ve learnt my lesson to make a backup account.\n", "Q: USB Modem Stopped Connecting i had my USB Modem ZTE working fine on Ubuntu, untill yesterday it won't connect anymore, yet it's detected as a modem in the connection manager but it won't connect, i tried it in Windows to make sure n it was working fine, and i have no idea how to troubleshoot the USB Modem!!!\nThanks in advance.!\nThis's what i get trying to connect\n\nA: I had the same problem.

It requires you have SSH access to the server you are using as a proxy. Change your web browser's proxy settings for SOCKS Proxy to 127.0.0.1, set the Port to 8000, and also check the box for SOCKS v5\nNext, create the SSH connection and send traffic for port 8000 on your machine to the server:\nssh -D 8000 your_ssh_username@your_remote_server\nyour_remote_server can be the name of your server in DNS (myserver.example.com) or an IP address. Use a dynamic DNS service if your home IP address changes frequently.\nLeave that SSH connection open while you surf. If you want to go back to 'regular' surfing, undo the changes you made in your web browser's proxy settings.\nVerify that your web browser is using the proxy by visiting a site that shows your IP address such as www.icanhazip.com - it should show the IP address of your Ubuntu server and not the IP address of the computer you are using.\n", "Q: How to monitor udp connections request time/duration?

It can be a GUI as for now I just want to do some monitoring and see what's holding back.\n\nA: I think you can use Wireshark to capture segment for some period and analyze it for tcp/udp for SYN and SYN-ACK responses.

If I have several directories, like:\nafoo abar\n\nsometimes my terminal will refuse autocomplete when I press tab (e.g. \"cd a\" then tab), and print the list of directories instead. Sometimes it even throws a noisy, annoying sound. Any idea how to make it autocomplete in cases like this? E.g it can show abar first, and then afoo if I press tab again. I saw this is the case in windows, or some applciation in Ubuntu\n\nA: Something that is a life-saver for me is to have bash cycle through the possibilities instead of showing a dumb list.\nAs bash is using readline for its auto-completion, add the following lines to ~/.inputrc\nOnce you're satisfied and have thoroughly tested below solution for a few days/weeks, cut and paste (don't copy!) the same settings from ~/.inputrc to /etc/inputrc which contains the system-wide settings, making this available to all users on your system (including guest).\nThe codez:\n# mappings to have up and down arrow searching through history:\n\"\\e[A\": history-search-backward\n\"\\e[B\": history-search-forward\n# mappings to have left and right arrow go left and right: \n\"\\e[C\": forward-char\n\"\\e[D\": backward-char\n\n# mapping to have [Tab] and [Shift]+[Tab] to cycle through all the possible completions:\n\"\\t\": menu-complete\n\"\\e[Z\": menu-complete-backward\n\nthen exit your terminal (or remote terminal like putty) and open it again...\nExamples:\n\n\n*\n\n*When you have 3 files: file1, file2 and file3 and you type:\ne fTabTabTab\nit'll cycle through:\ne file1\ne file2\ne file3\n\nand when you want to cycle backwards, just hit Shift+Tab\n\n*When you type:\nvery-complicated-command with lots of command line parameters\n\nand next time you need the same command, you just type:\nvery↑\nand it'll type for you:\nvery-complicated-command with lots of command line parameters\n\nThis will save you a ton of time in bash!  ;-)\n\nA: After the 1st tab you need to insert more letters. So if you type\ncd a\n\nand hit tab you get nothing and after a second tab (immediately following) you get a list of the names starting with a and then need to insert an f to have it auto complete the remainder so\ncd atabtabftabtab\nwill result in\ncd afoo\n\n\nA: To do it in Bash add the fllowing to your bash file:\n# make tab cycle through commands after listing\nbind '\"\\t\":menu-complete'\nbind \"set show-all-if-ambiguous on\"\nbind \"set completion-ignore-case on\"\nbind \"set menu-complete-display-prefix on\"\n\nWorks nicely.

While df is to show the file system usage, du is to report the file space usage. du works from files while df works at filesystem level, reporting what the kernel says it has available. Continue reading the du manpage support this:\n\nSummarize disk usage of each FILE, recursively for directories.\n\nit says du works with files.\n\ndf displays the\n         amount of disk space available on the file system containing each  file\n         name  argument.   If  no file name is given, the space available on all\n         currently mounted file systems is shown.\n\nhere says that df do not care about the files but the filesystem itself.\n\nA: df\n\nSummarize free disk space\nIt displays the amount of disk space available .\ndu\n\nSummarize disk usage.\nIt displays the amount of disk space used. \n\nA: Simply said: \nYou ran du without root permissions. So it is not able to check the available space in /proc, /mnt, etc, folders.\ndf showed the total used & free space respectively.\nSo when you check the Linux root file system, take the du report as final.\n\nA: nothing that much confusing : Here is look :=\n1) du == Disk Usage\n  How much disk space is being used by these files?  \n2) df == Disk Free\n   How much free disk space do we have?\nAlso for the system is running in low graphics mode 'here'\n\nA: I did \nsudo du -hxa  / | egrep '^[[:digit:]]{1,1}G[[:space:]]*'\nIt exactly accounted for the big discrepancy of 21GB that I was seeing!\nThe file in question was /swap file if 21GB!!\n\nA: In my case lsof did not help. I was able to track this down because I had mounted disk images using losetup as loop devices. Even after unmounting these devices and deleting the corresponding images there were processes that maintained some sort of indirect reference to the disk images.\nSo in short, sudo ps -ef|grep loop then sudo losetup -d /dev/loopX. This is not a direct answer to why du and df disagree but it has come up often enough for me that I was able to finally figure out the reason why which was different from any answer I could find.\n\nA: Adding my situation in case it helps someone. In my case, du reported 6G used and df reported 23G used -- a 17G difference!\nBut my problem was, I had a folder on the primary disk at /mnt/data with 17G of files in it, and then a SSD mounted at /mnt/data -- the result was the SSD mount essentially hid the data on the primary disk.\nSo check if it's possible you have other disks mounted on a non-empty directory on the disk in question.

Thanks.\n\nSolution\nI found My /boot partition hit 100% and now I can't upgrade. Can't remove old kernels to make room later. Basically, I followed his advise by [removing] old vmlinuz initrd, abi and System.map files individually until I got enough free space. I only need to delete the first two.\nThen I do sudo apt-get install -f and finally use @Salem's little bash script to remove most of the old kernels. I kept the last two as suggested. Reboot at the end, and then if I do uname -a I will see the new kernel is now installed (in my case, that's 40).\n\nA: I think your problem is that apt is trying to install/remove linux-image-generic-pae, which should point to the latest kernel available (which is linux-image-3.2.0-40-generic-pae) but the latest kernel you have installed is the *39.\nSo I suggest you to run the command suggested by apt with --dry-run (this will only simulate what apt would do):\nsudo apt-get -f install --dry-run\n\nThis will let you know what apt is trying to do, and then you can decide if it is ok or not (if it tries to install the newest kernel that's ok, if it tries to remove the one you are using it may be better to try something else).\nAfter that, probably the better way is to remove each kernel manually (in your apt-get purge output it seems to be selecting everyting correctly). You can specify each command alone or you can do something like:\nfor version in {29..38}; do\necho \"Removing kernel 3.2.0-$version\"\nsudo apt-get remove linux-image-3.2.0-$version-generic-pae\ndone\n\n", "Q: How to recovery the deleted Files I have a Java Project (Oauth ,this is its name), and I worked on Ubuntu 12.10\nAnd I delete it from eclipse (delete it from disk...)\nThis is a important Project for me .\nCan anybody else tell me how can I recovery my Java Project .\n\nA: You can try to install extundelete via the software center.

I have set this up the way I like and am now afraid of the next or second next update dropping beloved fallback mode.\nMoving forward, what are my best options in your eyes? Never update gnome from now on? Set up MATE, make friends with slower GNOME 3 classic look or the cinnamon equivalent, tweak XFCE to suit my expectations? Can I somehow keep GNOME fallback as an autonomous desktop and get rid of gnome 3 shell and cinnamon (without dropping nemo preferably)?\nThanks for your suggestions!\n\nA: if you are fine with making friends with gnome 3, Ubuntu has released a Ubuntu/gnome OS. their are instructions for switching to this flavor here.\n\nA: If you want to keep the 'fallback' mode you're probably best to find a different DE. It's never a good idea to hold-back updates just for the old environment. Sooner or later you will want to install applications that conflict with the library versions you have installed.\nAs of Gnome 3.8, they have removed the fallback mode. They have added Gnome Classic mode which used the Gnome 3 shell and some extensions to accomplish pretty close to the original look you're after. Ubuntu 13.04 (and even Ubuntu GNOME 13.04) will ship with Gnome 3.6 which does not contain the new classic mode. However the Gnome3 PPA will allow upgrades to some parts of 3.8, though at this point Classic mode is not among them. There are additionally the staging and testing PPAs which can be added which do introduce that functionality but also introduce less stability.\n", "Q: Multiboot Win 7, Ubuntu + Linux on UEFI system I am quite happy and content today. Yesterday I was able to install Ubuntu 12.10 on my VAIO-S Windows 7 machine from 2012 with UEFI and secure-boot. I've failed several times, but using the secure-remix iso it worked. Then I used boot-repair, which fixed the EFI in a series of automated steps. Very nice!!\nBut now I wonder if it is possible to install other Linux distros alongside Ubuntu. I want to review them for a blog I have, that's why. And I believe I read somewhere that GPT disks can have up to 128 primary partitions!\nSo my question is: How do I best do this? Can I just go ahead and install 2 or 3 other distros and then re-run boot repair and have it fix the EFI? \nOr is there an other way to do it? \nRight now I would like to have a look at Fedora and Zorin, but while I will be using Ubuntu for work, I will be swapping other distros in and out, so that is a concern here.\nI hope somebody can tell me how to go about this smartly!!\n\nA: Your multi-boot will not work if you use distributions not compatible with UEFI and SecureBoot. (eg Debian)\nCurrently, very few Linux distribution have good support of UEFI+SecureBoot.(AFAIK, only Ubuntu12.04.2/12.10 and the last Fedora and derivatives) \nFurthermore, I think that Ubuntu and Fedora have different ways to handle UEFI+SecureBoot, so it might not be possible to do a Ubuntu+Fedora multiboot on UEFI/SecureBoot. To workaround this, I recommend you first disable SecureBoot, then run Boot-Repair (this will convert Ubuntu into \"Non SecureBoot\" mode), then check that Windows+Ubuntu still work, then install Fedora, then run Boot-Repair again.\n", "Q: Will running Ubuntu from USB on a Windows 8 pc damage Windows? I have a laptop with Windows 8 64bit pre-installed. I made a bootable USB stick of Ubuntu 12.10 64bit using PenDriveLinux with persistence. Is it safe for me to run it on my Windows 8 pc without damaging it?\nI would do it without hesitation on any other machine but having heard strange things about the BIOS and UEFI. I thought I should ask someone who has tried it before I break my PC or get sued by Microsoft or whatever.\n\nA: Running the live media should not affect your Windows installation in any way.  Good luck with the persistence though, (bug 1159016) so you might want a separate USB around just for data transfer.  UEFI is just the BIOS replacement, no big deal, but it can come with secure boot,\n(which your preinstalled W8 uses), which changes things a lot.  Before you do ANY installs to ANYTHING (like another USB), backup the EFI files, visible in /boot/efi (they should all be under directory EFI, and are just files).  There are so many machine specific problems, that I hesitate to predict what your Lenovo will do, but it is good to have a set of files to restore if your pc suddenly cannot boot W8 anymore.\n  boot-repair is a tool which fixes up some installer issues, and is a good thing to have around.  If you have working persistence on the live-media, you can install it:\nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:yannubuntu/boot-repair\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get install boot-repair\n\nOr download and burn an iso with it preinstalled from \nLinux secure remix\n", "Q: Disable the autohide feature in the Ubuntu menubar Is there any way to prevent the menu items in the global menu bar from hiding until mouseover?

Then use the gparted utility to resize your Linux partition and prepare the rest of the disk so you can install Windows on it.\n\nA: First of all you need to know that while the partition in question is mounted, no further actions can be done. \nIn order for the process to be completed you must:\n\n\n*\n\n*Boot from a live Ubuntu CD or USB first.\n\n*Start GParted which is an application used to work with disk drives (it can create, erase or modify partitions).\n\n*Unmount any partitions which may be mounted (the live operating system may mount the swap partition).\n\n*Modify the partition according to your needs.\n\n*The above process will leave unallocated space to the disk. There you can create a new partition for Windows to be installed.\n\n*When finished making the partitions click the check button of GParted to perform the selected actions.\nKeep in mind that if you modify the start of operating system's partitions (the left edge as shown in GParted) you will probably has issues with the boot loader and you will have to reinstall the boot loader again. \nCredits and full reference at this link that explains the process with screenshots.\n", "Q: what is the difference between these two methods of upgrading ubuntu We could upgrade by installing a new system using 'ubuntu12.10.iso'. also We can upgrade from an older version of ubuntu , say 'ubuntu12.04'. But what is the difference between these two methods ? \n\nA: The difference is one of \"Clean Installation\" vs. \"In Place Upgrade\"\nA \"clean installation\" will indeed put the given version of Ubuntu on the ISO onto the system.  But in doing so, it will overwrite the previous version, so you have to back up your data ahead of time and reload it.\nAn \"upgrade in place\" is exactly that.  It will upgrade the current OS files to the next version of Ubuntu.  However, this poses the risk of package breakage during the upgrade, and that can be problematic.  You should be backing up your data for this method too.\nTypically, the \"clean installation\" has lesser of a chance of package breakage.\n\nA: The above answer is good, but let me add a little...\nAs an example, I just did (yesterday) a clean install of ububtu  13.04 beta and my google chrome broke. Why? Well, previously I had been upgrading .....-->11.10-->12.04--->12.10-->13.04 and it carried along dependencies with it,so I never knew. By the Same token, an inplace upgrade will get you to the latest packages, but will leave the old stuff in place, vulnerabilities  and all. While it is certainly nice to do an upgrade, I really think the best way to go is to: \n\n\n*\n\n*Create a VM, restore and upgrade your current installation  into it.\n\n*Test it out\n\n*Create a VM with the new version of ubuntu in it, reinstall applications, restore data.\n\n*Test is out.\n\n*Stick with the one that works best for you.\n\n", "Q: 12.10 Black screen on boot after unplugging external monitor Here is my story:\n1.

I haven't found any good method and not everyone seems to experience this.\nQuestion: How can I prevent this? Are there any settings in /etc/ntp.conf to force ntpd to be more aggressive in synchronizing the time inside the VM or should I use ntpdate -b timeserver instead inside a cron job running every so often?\nWhich method is recommended to avoid leaps when using ntpdate -b or clock drift in general inside a Ubuntu virtual machine?\n\nSide-note: I've seen similar effects on vios (IBM hypervisor) slaves running AIX as well as on Solaris. So the problem is very real and appears to be related to hypervisors in general.\n\nA: In VirtualBox at least, you can... I had time sync problems before, but tuning the Guest Additions time synchronization parameters seemed to fix it.\nHere is relevant text from the manual:\n\nTuning the Guest Additions time synchronization parameters\nThe VirtualBox Guest Additions ensure that the guest's system time is synchronized with the host time. There are several parameters which can be tuned. The parameters can be set for a specific VM using the following command:\nVBoxManage guestproperty set \"VM name\" \"/VirtualBox/GuestAdd/VBoxService/PARAMETER\" VALUE\n\nwhere PARAMETER is one of the following:\n--timesync-interval\nSpecifies the interval at which to synchronize the time with the host. The default is 10000 ms (10 seconds).\n--timesync-min-adjust\nThe minimum absolute drift value measured in milliseconds to make adjustments for. The default is 1000 ms on OS/2 and 100 ms elsewhere.\n--timesync-latency-factor\nThe factor to multiply the time query latency with to calculate the dynamic minimum adjust time. The default is 8 times, that means in detail: Measure the time it takes to determine the host time (the guest has to contact the VM host service which may take some time), multiply this value by 8 and do an adjustment only if the time difference between host and guest is bigger than this value. Don't do any time adjustment otherwise.\n--timesync-max-latency\nThe max host timer query latency to accept. The default is 250 ms.\n--timesync-set-threshold\nThe absolute drift threshold, given as milliseconds where to start setting the time instead of trying to smoothly adjust it. The default is 20 minutes.\n--timesync-set-start\nSet the time when starting the time sync service.\n--timesync-set-on-restore 0|1\nSet the time after the VM was restored from a saved state when passing 1 as parameter (default). Disable by passing 0. In the latter case, the time will be adjusted smoothly which can take a long time.\nAll these parameters can be specified as command line parameters to VBoxService as well.\nDisabling the Guest Additions time synchronization\nOnce installed and started, the VirtualBox Guest Additions will try to synchronize the guest time with the host time. This can be prevented by forbidding the guest service from reading the host clock:\nVBoxManage setextradata \"VM name\" \"VBoxInternal/Devices/VMMDev/0/Config/GetHostTimeDisabled\"\n\n\n\nA: I observed similar symptoms on a Linux machine running on VMware ESX. It seems that the drift (several minutes per day) was caused by having time synchronization both provided by NTP inside the VM and VMware tools. We solved our problem by disabling time synchronization in the VMware tools properties (in the VM properties in ESX). After that NTP was able to keep the clock in synch with a remote time server. If you prefer to edit the .vmx file manually, set tools.syncTime = \"0\".\nStopping NTP inside the VM and letting the tools synch the time would probably work as well, at least to correct the server drift. ESX itself can run an NTP daemon. VMware's timekeeping best practices recommend using NTP instead of VMWare Tools for time synchronization.\nVMware publishes a lengthy paper on timekeeping in VMware virtual machines. The most relevant passage is the subsection “Clocksource Kernels”. The VMware KB also has troubleshooting tips for timekeeping in Linux guests.\n\nA: In virtualbox you can try to modify the paravirtualisation parameter of your VM.\nIn the setting of your machine go to:\nSysteme > Acceleration\n\nThis fix the issue for me.\n", "Q: 13.04 - Fn volume keys not working on Dell Inspiron 1470 I'm using a Dell Inspiron 1470, and eversince I updated to 13.04, none of the Fn keys are working, except for brightness and WiFi.\n\nA: Perhaps Ubuntu is simply seeing them as regular keys.

Since people seem to be interested in discussing it, though:\n\n\n*\n\n*Using the Back button is not a suitable workaround; it does not always take me to the parent folder.\n\n*You can navigate up by pressing Alt+Up.\n\n*The desired behavior in this example is for \"up\" to navigate to the parent folder of the symbolic link. The current behavior is to navigate to the parent folder of the target of the symbolic link.\n\n\n\nA: This one is a workaround, but may not constitute the actual answer you're trying to find:\nOn nautilus, Ctrl+L, type in the symlink name (e.g. link or ./link), Enter. It will not dereference the symlink this time.\n\nA: \nUPDATE: this TERRIBLE BUG apparently is now fixed in Nautilus 3.14.2,\n  what follows is a workaround for older versions\n\nI found this workaround:\n\n\n*\n\n*Install Nautilus-Actions Configuration Tool\n\n*Run nautilus-actions\n\n*Add an action called \"Open Link\"\n\n*In the \"Command\" Tab -> Path: /usr/bin/nautilus, Parameters:\n--no-default-window %u (optional) Menu Edit->Preferences->uncheck\n\"Create a root 'Nautilus-action' menu, uncheck \"Add an 'About' ...\"\n\n*Restart Nautilus (e.g. xkill)\n\n*Right click any symlink folder, a new Nautilus window will open with\nthe folder (not the dereferenced folder).\nLimitations still: a) Nautilus now has to context menus \"Open\" and \"Open Link\" (you have to remember to use the right one), b) a new window opens each time.\n", "Q: Mirror Files and Documents from Windows machine to Ubuntu in Virtualbox Ok, so I have a machine with a dual boot installed (Windows 8 and Ubuntu 12.10). They are on separate hard drives. I already have Virtualbox set up to boot from the linux physical hard drive (Windows 8 Host). I also have shared my Windows User folder using the Virtualbox folder share. Here is my problem: I would love to be able to just go to the Documents folder to access my Windows folder Documents. I think there is a way to do this with symlinks... but sometimes I do need to boot just into Ubuntu (not in Virtualbox) and it messes up the symlinks (because the Windows Documents are now not accessible via the Virtualbox folder but through the actual hard drive). Any ideas?\nThanks in advance!\n\nA: Thanks all who were trying to help.\nI finally figured it out.\nHere is what I did:\nsudo gedit /usr/local/bin/mountscript.sh\n\nIn Virtualbox make sure to create a share for what ever drive you want to access (mine is C), and name the share C. Oh, and make sure it is marked permanent.\nPaste in this and save (make sure and replace [UBUNTU_USERNAME] and [WINDOWS_USERNAME] with their respective usernames):\n#!/bin/bash\nsudo mount -t vboxsf C /media/C\nsudo mount --bind /media/C/Users/[WINDOWS_USERNAME]/Documents/ ~/Documents/\nsudo mount --bind /media/[UBUNTU_USERNAME]/C/Users/[WINDOWS_USERNAME]/Documents /home/[UBUNTU_USERNAME]/Documents\n\nThen to make it executable run this:\nchmod +x /usr/local/bin/mountscript.sh\n\nThen to make sure you do not have to enter your password each time you boot:\nsudo visudo\n\nThen at the end add this:\n[UBUNTU_USERNAME] ALL=NOPASSWD: /usr/local/bin/mountscript.sh, /bin/mount\n\nThen open the dash and search for: Startup Applications.\nClick add, and in the name field type: Mount Script\nIn the command field type: /usr/local/bin/mountscript.sh\nClick add. Close out everything and reboot!\nHope this helps!\n\nA: There are all sorts of ways to do that, but in the end you will have the same sorts of problems you are having. Just save your stuff to a small ntfs partition in the first place. \n", "Q: How can I open a folder in a new window? It appears that Nautilus no longer provides an Open in New Window option in its right-click context menus:\n\nWhat procedure should I now use instead when I want to open a folder in a new window?\n\nA: Hold Shift while double-clicking it.\nI discovered that through trial and error. The documentation of keyboard shortcuts for Files is frustratingly sparse.\n\nA: Simplest workaround:\nRight-click the last item in the 'location bar', choose \"Open in new window\". You have now two identical windows*.\n* Well almost; the new window automatically scrolls to the top.\nsource: https://askubuntu.com/a/335310/495443\n\nA: Edit -> Preferences, under the Behaviour tab, you can choose to open each folder in a new window, but this would get annoying if it was the default option!\n\nA: What I did is: \nEdit -> Preferences -> Behavior -> Open each folder its own window /UNCHECK/\nIt was unchecked already, and must be so by default, so I checked, closed, tried the behavior which did open new window but in initial manner.\nThen I returned to the Preferences and unchecked, tried it and voila! \nGood luck!\n", "Q: Gthumb 3 for ubuntu 10.04 I have ubuntu 10.04 installed and I don't want to upgrade, but I do want to enjoy new features of gthumb 3, like ability to import from folders etc.\nAfter some googling, I found that 2.13.1 is the last gthumb version for lucid due to dependencies to GTK+ 2.24. Is there any way to make it working without upgrade? Patches? Hacks? Even version 2.13.90 is enough...\nThanks in advance,\nAlexander Noshe\n\nA: No, it's unlikely to be backported for Lucid.

I do this.\nping www.doggiedooley.com | grep -o \"[[:digit:]]*.[[:digit:]]* ms\" > ping.txt\n\nI had high hopes for this command, but even though the file is created, it contains nothing, even after a while. If I remove the redirection, output is shown. I can even redirect the output successfully to another terminal.\nping www.doggiedooley.com | grep -o \"[[:digit:]]*.[[:digit:]]* ms\" > /dev/pts/1\n\nWhy is the first command not working properly?\n\nA: Looks like a stdout buffering issue.

I have a question...when using multiple partitions for shared access, do you use '/media/' as the mount point, or is there a different way to set this stuff up?  I'm setting up a multimedia system that dual boots Ubuntu and Win7 off of a single 1TB drive, and has a 1TB as a slave for music, games and pics, along with a 2TB slave for movies and shows.  The only thing I really know about mount points for shared partitions is that my Windows partition mount point is '/media/OS' And that the Partition label is 'OS'.  Aside from that, I've never tried to set up slaves under Ubuntu.  I've done it under windows, but, I know that's another animal entirely.\n\nA: You can actually use single HDD for dual booting without any issue, because both OS will be installed on different partitions.\nAnd as far as mount point goes, you should be able to use \"/\" as your mount point. This little old but very good official help should give you better idea about partitioning in general in Ubuntu.\n", "Q: ext2 root partition, incorrect mount time I've been bugged by my laptop going into a disk check at every powerup, and I think I have figured out why.\nMy root partition is ext2 (I chose it when I set the laptop up, and I haven't wanted to risk updating it to ext3). When I run 'dumpe2fs', it shows the last mount time was over a month ago (which I think may be triggering the disk check), whereas, strangely the last write time was today.\nI've already run the disk check tool -> SMART Data and Tests -> Self Tests, and that doesn't bring up anything bad. \nWhy could my mount time be wrong, and how do I fix it?\nThanks\n\nA: First thing to check would be the hardware clock in the bios. The hardware clock keeps the current time and date even when the system is shut down, however, if it is not working properly, then this could cause problems.\n\n\n*\n\n*Power on the laptop, but instead of booting Linux, go into the BIOS.\n\n*On the first bios panel there is usually a day-date setting.\n\n*If the system boots Windows as well as Linux then the time should be your local time.\n\n*If the system is Linux only, then the time may be UTC.\n\n*You may need to repeat this check a few times order a period of days because it may be affected by your laptop battery as well as a button cell inside the laptop.\n\n\nIf the hardware clock is not working correctly, that will likely be the cause of the disk checks, because the Linux system clock is set initially from the hardware clock, but then is adjusted forward after your laptop connects to the network, confusing e2fsck.\n\n\n*\n\n*Greg\n\n", "Q: pygi how to toggle button without running function I'm writing this application using quickly.\nI'm looking for a way to toggle button without running function which is connected to this button.\ndef on_button_text_italic_toggled(self, widget):\n    print \"Italic\"\n\ndef on_buttone_test_clicked(self, widget):\n    self.button_text_italic.set_active(True)\n\nSo I need this to make button_text_italic to be toggled but without printing out \"Italic\" text.\nThanks for any help!\n\nA: If you want the function to be run most of the time the toggle signal is emitted, and not when you manually toggle it (e.g. when loading saved settings and displaying the appropriate state), then you need to block and unblock the signal. To do so you'll need the handle_id that was returned when the signal was connected to the function.  Just assign a variable when you connect the signal. Here's an example:\n#!/usr/bin/python\nfrom gi.repository import Gtk\n\ndef on_toggle(widget,data=None):\n    print \"toggled, emitted signal\"\n\ndef on_button1_clicked(widget, data=None):\n    print \"manually toggle, no signal\"\n    toggle.handler_block(handle_id)\n    state=toggle.get_active()\n    toggle.set_active(not state)\n    toggle.handler_unblock(handle_id)\n\n\nwin=Gtk.Window()\nwin.connect('destroy', Gtk.main_quit)\nbox=Gtk.Box(orientation=Gtk.Orientation.VERTICAL)\nbutton1=Gtk.Button('Toggle with no signal')\nbutton1.connect('clicked', on_button1_clicked)\nbutton1.show()\nbox.pack_start(button1,True,True,10)\ntoggle=Gtk.ToggleButton('Toggle')\nhandle_id=toggle.connect('toggled', on_toggle)\ntoggle.show()\nbox.pack_start(toggle,True,True,0)\nbox.show_all()\nwin.add(box)\nwin.show()\nGtk.main()\n\n\nA: on_button_text_italic_toggled is an object method which gets invoked when the on_buttone_test_clicked gets called so it is natural to execute it's specified code.\nYou will have to replace the print \"Itallic\" line with pass a Python keyword but this leaves you with the on_button_text_italic_toggled doing nothing so you may not want to invoke it.\nYou can learn more about functions here and how to define classes and methods here\n", "Q: Errors when running apt-get update? \nW: Failed to fetch http://dl.google.com/linux/deb/dists/raring/Release.gpg  Something wicked happened resolving 'dl.google.com:http' (-11 - System error)\n\nW: Failed to fetch http://packages.medibuntu.org/dists/raring/Release.gpg  Something wicked happened resolving 'packages.medibuntu.org:http' (-11 - System error)\n\nW: Failed to fetch http://repository.spotify.com/dists/raring/non-free/binary-amd64/Packages  404  Not Found\n\nW: Failed to fetch http://repository.spotify.com/dists/raring/non-free/binary-i386/Packages  404  Not Found\n\nW: Failed to fetch http://dl.google.com/linux/deb/dists/raring/non-free/binary-amd64/Packages  404  Not Found [IP: 173.194.46.69 80]\n\nW: Failed to fetch http://dl.google.com/linux/deb/dists/raring/main/binary-amd64/Packages  404  Not Found [IP: 173.194.46.69 80]\n\nW: Failed to fetch http://dl.google.com/linux/deb/dists/raring/non-free/binary-i386/Packages  404  Not Found [IP: 173.194.46.69 80]\n\nW: Failed to fetch http://dl.google.com/linux/deb/dists/raring/main/binary-i386/Packages  404  Not Found [IP: 173.194.46.69 80]\n\nW: Failed to fetch http://ppa.launchpad.net/stebbins/handbrake-releases/ubuntu/dists/raring/main/binary-amd64/Packages  404  Not Found\n\nW: Failed to fetch http://ppa.launchpad.net/stebbins/handbrake-releases/ubuntu/dists/raring/main/binary-i386/Packages  404  Not Found\n\nW: Failed to fetch http://ppa.launchpad.net/amith/ubuntutools/ubuntu/dists/raring/main/binary-amd64/Packages  404  Not Found\n\nW: Failed to fetch http://ppa.launchpad.net/amith/ubuntutools/ubuntu/dists/raring/main/binary-i386/Packages  404  Not Found\n\nE: Some index files failed to download.

I have quite a few third party apps, and I was wondering if as long as my computer sees the repository, will it update from update manager? Thanks!\n\nA: Short answer: yes it does provided we had added the third party repository to our sources, and updates are made available from there.\nFrom the \"Settings...\" menu in Update Manager we can define how often we need it to check for updates available. Make sure to not choose \"Never\" to get notified if any newer versions are available for your release.\n\nBy doing so we get regular updates, e.g. for Virtual Box, or applications loaded from the Medibuntu, or the getdeb repositories. In case a third party repository is down or we do not want an update notification we may temporarily disable this repository by unticking it in the \"Other Software\" tab.\n", "Q: How can instantaneously extract text from a screen area using OCR tools?

The clipboard version additionally utilizes xsel to pipe the output into the clipboard.\n\nNOTE: scrot, xsel, imagemagick and tesseract-ocr are not installed by default but are available from the the default repositories.\nYou may be able to replace scrot with gnome-screenshot, but it may take a lot of work.

Is it even possible? And if so, how do I do it?\nI already know you can use Javascript and C++, but I'm looking for C. My favourite languages are C and Python and I'd really like to stick with them.\n\nA: As far as I know there are no C bindings for QML (I don't think there are C bindings for Qt at all actually). Qt is built in C++ anyway, so you would be better off just going with that, unfortunately. If you are looking to use QML, it may be possible to use Python (writing your back-end in Python and simply using a QML GUI, if it is that kind of application).\nOtherwise, your options are rather slim here.\n\nA: Well, what I'm deciding to do now, after some research on my options, I'm going to just write the GUI in C++, and the rest of my app in C. After looking up how it's done, it doesn't look too difficult to mix C++ and C, the thing is I probably have over a 1000 lines of code in C, rewriting the GTK stuff shouldn't take too long with how streamlined QML is, so the C++ GUI file is going to be pretty minimal.

(When you bought the computer, did they create an account for you? Or did you just start to use an account that they had previously used - that feels wrong, a bit like a second-hand toothbrush)\nAssuming you have your own account or you are using one they gave you, there is a chance that it is privileged to execute commands as super-user (sudo command).

The reason behind this is that if you happen to copy something from your Ubuntu system to the Window's hibernated system, it will be lost when you boot Windows.\nThis is actually a safety feature put by the mounting process in Ubuntu because many users complaint that when they copied something from Ubuntu to Windows, they lost the data. It later came to light, that the Windows system was hibernated, creating this problem because in hibernation, everything is frozen (The system is read only) and is not changed until you boot again from within Windows.\nThe recommendation as mentioned by the warning is to boot Windows 8 and shut the system correctly. not by hibernation, but by the shutdown option.\nIf you still want to mount the unit, it should be in a READ ONLY state. For this we could do the following:\nsudo mount -o ro /dev/sda2 /mnt \nWhere ro is Read Only, /dev/sda2 is the partition you want to mount and /mnt is where you want to mount this partition.\nStill I would go with going to Windows 8, shutting down the computer (No hibernation) and going back to Ubuntu and enjoy a warm and sweet moment with a Read/Write partition.\nUPDATE: If your Windows 8 system always stays in a hibernated state, please read the section about TROUBLESHOOT in Installing Ubuntu Alongside a Pre-Installed Windows with UEFI . It covers the weird behavior \"feature\" Windows 8 offers to users automatically to make the system more confusing \"better\" for them.\n\nA: Disclaimer: this must be run on your windows partition (inside CMD).\nShutdown Windows 8 with the following command: \nshutdown /s /t 0\n\nIt worked for me.

Suppose my Ubuntu version is Natty and I want to install the latest nodejs using apt-get. However, the latest nodejs is only available in the package repository of Quantal.(see http://packages.ubuntu.com/search?keywords=nodejs&searchon=names&section=all), which force me to either update my operating system to Quantal or build the latest nodejs from its source tarball. \nThe building script of nodejs on Natty has no difference from that on Quantal . Why the maintainers of Ubuntu package repositories don't even try to keep package repositories of Natty up with Quantal?\n\nA: Natty is End of Life.\nThat means it is no longer a supported version of Ubuntu, therefore there are no updates issued for it, and the standard repositories for it were disabled and moved elsewhere in a read-only capacity, usually useful only for upgrading from release-to-release to get to a stable release.\nThat's why you're not going to see updated software on Natty.

In nautilus, if you right click a file and paste to a text editor you will get the full path to that file, similarly for folders, also, if you right click a file and select properties, in the basic tab you can copy the filename and location.\nIf you select multiple files and select copy, then paste to a text editor you will get the full paths to the selected files, you can use your text editor's search and replace feature to strip away the path names and you will have only file names remaining.\n", "Q: My headphones mute AlsaMixer when I plug them in, HP DV6 12.04 Whenever I plug any type of headphones into one of the audio out connectors on my hp dv6, alsa mutes them, muting the \"speaker\" setting(see attached image).

attached\nnow use \"mount /dev/sda1 /mnt \"\nnow move into the partion mounted using command \"cd /mnt \" and now do \" ls \" and this ls will list all your files and you can know weather you have linux installed or not using some file structure . eg when i do ls i get like this :\nbin patches {bin,sbin,conf,samples} proc boot root cdrom run config sbin data selinux debug setup dev share doc src etc srv home sys initrd.img tmp lib usr\nso if you have similar file structuer then this is your partion where you have linux installed in hdd\nif not then do \"sudo umount /dev/sda1\" and then do \"sudo mount /dev/sda2\" etc like this try all your partions untill you see your files\nso now you got to know your partion where the ubuntu is already install in you haddisk , say ex the hard disk is sda2\nnow do there comands to mount the proc and sys dirs,\nsudo mount --bind /dev/ /mnt/dev sudo chroot /mnt \"{you have gone into chroot env now you have to mount proc and sys\"}\nmount -t proc none

Naturally, it has a Japanese keyboard.\nWhen installing 12.10, I chose the closest keyboard layout I could find: Japanese(OADG 109A). \nBut somehow my keyboard doesn't respond to the Japanese switch key so I'm stuck with typing in English only.\nI have installed the Japanese language and Japanese Anthy(ibus). Those work fine. \nWhat I really want is to type in Japanese via the Hiragana printed characters on the keyboard.\nThis is the first time I am using a Japanese keyboard, so any help would be appreciated.\n\nA: Go to System Settings -> Keyboard -> Keyboard Layout and try adding and trying other layouts, see if any of them work. \nHere, I just tried with one named Kana, and it types directly in Japanese.\n\nA: Did you mean Kana input?\nibus-anthy has multiple ways of entering the kana. Default mode is via phonetic romaji (roman alphabets). You can change the input mode to Kana input, which uses the hiragana on the keyboard as you asked.\nSince you got ibus-anthy set up, I assume have a toolbar like this floating on your desktop  or glued to your panel (source: Ubuntulinux.jp Wiki article on IbusAnthy):\n\nSee the third button from the left, with the symbol R. That is the button for selecting input type. R denotes romaji input type. Kana input should be selectable by clicking on that button.\n\nThere are a couple of things I need to confirm though:\n\n\n*\n\n*You said you chose OADG 109A but the Japanese switch key didn't respond. Does other buttons, say, like the @ key map correctly?\n\n*I assume by Japanese switch key you mean the one to the left of 1 key, i.e. the Zenkaku_Hankaku key. Di you mean that pressing that key didn't enable Japanese (romaji) input mode? It's possible that your ibus-anthy didn't have Zenkaku_Hankaku as the shortcut to toggle Japanese input. It's configurable via Anthy preferences.\n\n\nA: I would try and reinstall Ubuntu but when you select your keyboard, try 'detect keyboard layout'. \n", "Q: Using \"Try Ubuntu\" Option and can't get out of it I used a pendrive( Universal usb installer) to install Ubuntu on my pc.\nHere are the instructions that I followed :http://www.pendrivelinux.com/using-a-portable-virtualbox-to-run-linux-from-usb/\n (the pendrive is the virtual usb device )\nNow, every time I boot the Ubuntu main page appear and\nI am presented with three options:\nTry Ubuntu\nInstall Ubuntu on harddrive\nBoot from the first harddisk\n\nI know if choose install Ubuntu on hard drive option, the window blow off.\nSo for like 3 months I chose \"Try Ubuntu\" option.\nHow can I get back to my previous window?\nI know my window has been not yet wiped out...\nPlease give me advice. \n\nA: Windows will not be removed if you click the \"on hardrive\" option, it will give you an option to install Ubuntu, and also keep windows.

Because I started using Steam on Linux to play some older games I thought I would use the Intel 'official' drivers to ensure I get the best performance. Unfortunately, since installing the drivers, the computer fan is very loud and the battery doesn't last that long (it's cut battery life in half). On top of that, there's no noticeable difference when playing games on Steam. \nMy question is, how do I revert back to the original drivers? \nIf I run the Intel graphic driver installer I get the following output in the terminal (not in the GUI) so I assume I will somehow need to run apt-get with some type of downgrade flag (I'm not sure how to do that) against these packages.\ninstall: [i915-3.4-3.2-dkms libdrm-nouveau2]\nupgrade: [libcairo2 libcairo-gobject2 libcairo-script-interpreter2 libdrm2 libdrm-intel1 libkms1 libva1 libva-x11-1 libva-glx1 libva-tpi1 libva-egl1 vainfo libxatracker1 libgbm1 libegl1-mesa libegl1-mesa-drivers libopenvg1-mesa libgles1-mesa libgles2-mesa libglapi-mesa libgl1-mesa-glx libgl1-mesa-dri libgl1-mesa-dri-experimental libosmesa6 libglu1-mesa i965-va-driver libva-intel-vaapi-driver xserver-xorg-video-intel libwayland0]\n\nWhen I look at the install logs though, it seems there's much more than that. \nAny assistance on this would be most appreciated. \n\nA: This is what worked for me:\n#source http://theclonker.de/?p=89\nsudo sh -c 'echo \"\\nPackage: *\\nPin: release a=trusty*\\nPin-Priority: 1001\\n\\nPackage: *\\nPin: origin download.01.org\\nPin-Priority: -100\\n\" > /etc/apt/preferences.d/intel-removal'\nsudo apt-get dist-upgrade\nsudo rm /etc/apt/preferences.d/intel-removal\nsudo rm /etc/apt/sources.list.d/intellinuxgraphics.list*\nsudo apt-get update\necho \"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n Remember to remove the i915-3.6-3.5-dkms and intel-linux-graphics-installer packages with \\n\\n sudo apt-get purge i915-3.6-3.5-dkms intel-linux-graphics-installer \"\n\nYou should change the i915-3.6-3.5-dkms package name to your version.\nSource: https://gist.github.com/phdelodder/b28e8df770a6bc020aab\nThe original source http://theclonker.de/?p=89 was removed.\n\nA: Here is a possible solution to your problem http://theclonker.de/?p=89\n\nA: In the end I found this to be too frustrating to wait for the right answer. In order to fix the situation, I upgraded to version 12.10. It completely wiped all traces of the Intel drivers and I now have a quiet and cooler laptop. \n\nA: The easiest solution is to use the ppa-purge tool:\nsudo ppa-purge -s download.01.org ppa:gfx/ubuntu\n\nThis will disable the intel repository and downgrade all packages that were installed from this repository.\n\nA: sudo apt-get autoremove --purge intel-linux-graphics-installer\n\nA solution from http://www.liberiangeek.net/2013/04/how-to-add-intel-linux-graphics-driver-repository-in-ubuntu/\n\nA: In later versions the name has changed; to remove you need to run the following:\nsudo apt autoremove --purge intel-graphics-update-tool\n\n", "Q: How to remove software installed from source, where \"make\" was not used?

Is there anyway to do that ? If it needs them I still have the installation files.\nthis is the website\n\nA: If there is no uninstall option you need to manually remove the files.\nMost (if not all) of the files will be installed inside a directory (from the readme I would assume it is called ns-allinone-2.35) at the path you ran ./install. Simply use a rm -rf to remove that directory and it will be gone.\nNow for 1 extra step: during installion either the installer added some links to ~./bashrc or you edited them in yourself. So do a (backup at the 2nd command):\ncd ~\ncp  .bashrc .bashrc_old\ngedit ~/.bashrc \n\nand have a look for anything related to ns-allinone-2.35 and remove it. Be careful; if you mess up it might be problematic. After editing you need to parse the changes:\nsource ~/.bashrc \n\n\nA: All you need to do is delete the ns-allinone-2.35 directory. \nWhen you ran install from within that directory, it installed everything into the same directory. \nThe installer doesn't appear to make any changes to your ./bashrc file on it's own, but if you added any of the changes they recommend, then, of course, you will also need to undo those changes. \n", "Q: Is it safe to uninstall thunderbird?

In this example, that file is at ~/scripts/xclip-scripts/address.\nThe sleep command simply allows enough time for xclip to finish copying before xdotool starts trying to paste the text.\nThe xdotool command actually does the pasting of the text that xclip copied from your text file.\nSave your script and make it executable.\nchmod +x /path/to/your/script/<script_name>\n\nThe last step is to bind a shortcut key to your script.

I have an upstart script to start a custom nodejs app. The app depends on couchdb and elasticsearch. couchdb and elasticsearch provide init.d scripts for starting/stopping them. Is it possible to tell my upstart script that couchdb and elasticsearch are dependencies? I tried this in my upstart script but it does not seem to work:\nstart on (started couchdb and started elasticsearch)\nThanks!\n\nA: I had the same question, and I also found a different answer. The author lists 4 options to accomplish this, of which I like the first one best:\nUse initclt emit myservice-started to signal the completion of your dependent service's startup. In the linked answer, it is suggested to add this line to the end of the dependency service's init.d script, but I prefer a different method.\nI like to create a new inid.d script named myservice-started that only contains a start section. Using the appropriate commenting style in the file's header, I declare that it depends on $myservice to be started. In the start section, I tell upstart about myservice being started. You can install it with update-rc.d.\nI like this solution because it is not intrusive; if an update changes any of the existing init.d scripts, it won't affect these additional scripts.

Did it delete my private data? I had 3 Partitions:\n\n\n*\n\n*Local Disk C: with Windows installed \n\n*D: and E: with my data.\n\n\nWhile installing Ubuntu, I used:\n\nReplace Windows With Ubuntu Option\n\nHave I lost my data in D: and E: also? If not, where are they? I am not able to find them.\nPlease help, I am new to Ubuntu.\n\nA: I am sorry to say but yes, the D:, E: and any other letter assigned partitions are gone. The option mentions what it will do:\n\nThis will delete all of your Windows 7 programs, documents, photos, music and any other files.\nAnd it will leave you with a hard drive partitioned in 2 pieces, the root / partition and the swap.\nWhat you need to do quickly is, without using the partition (Or at least not using it even further) is to burn the Ubuntu image on a pen drive. Preferably do this on an other computer), run it from there on the PC you want to recover those deleted partitions from and install testdisk. After installing, run it from the terminal: \nsudo testdisk\n\nNow tell it to try to recover the partitions. If it succeeds, your Ubuntu partitions will be lost and the Windows partitions will be recovered.\nNote that after a testdisk recovery you will not be able to boot Windows or Ubuntu from the drive but you may be able to recover most (but probably not all) of your data from successfully recovered partition.\n", "Q: Can X.org Load Two Different Drivers? (Triple-Head Setup with Intel and NVidia Card) We want to set up a 3 screens with an onboard intel graphics adapter and an nvidia card.\nBoth cards are recognized in lspci\n\n01:00.0 VGA compatible controller: NVIDIA Corporation GT218 [GeForce 210] (rev a2)\n00:02.0 Display controller: Intel Corporation 2nd Generation Core Processor Family Integrated Graphics Controller (rev 09)\n\nAnd bascially work: If I switch to the console, I see output on the Intel card,\nX is only running on the Nvidia card.\nBut when I type xrandr | grep conn I get only one connected port:\n\nDVI-I-0 disconnected (normal left inverted right x axis y axis)\nVGA-0 disconnected (normal left inverted right x axis y axis)\nDVI-I-1 connected 1920x1200+0+0 (normal left inverted right x axis y axis) 518mm x 324mm\nHDMI-0 disconnected (normal left inverted right x axis y axis)\n\nI am on Ubuntu 12.10 (and XFCE) and installed the proprietary nvidia driver.\nI was assuming that X maybe has a problem to autodetect both cards, so I thought the following xorg.conf could help:\n\nSection \"ServerLayout\"\n    Identifier     \"Layout0\"\n    Screen      0  \"Screen0\"\n    Screen      1  \"Screen1\"\n    InputDevice    \"Keyboard0\" \"CoreKeyboard\"\n    InputDevice    \"Mouse0\" \"CorePointer\"\nEndSection\n\nSection \"Files\"\nEndSection\n\nSection \"InputDevice\"\n    # generated from default\n    Identifier     \"Mouse0\"\n    Driver         \"mouse\"\n    Option         \"Protocol\" \"auto\"\n    Option         \"Device\" \"/dev/psaux\"\n    Option         \"Emulate3Buttons\" \"no\"\n    Option         \"ZAxisMapping\" \"4 5\"\nEndSection\n\nSection \"InputDevice\"\n    # generated from default\n    Identifier     \"Keyboard0\"\n    Driver         \"kbd\"\nEndSection\n\nSection \"Monitor\"\n    Identifier     \"Monitor0\"\n    VendorName     \"Unknown\"\n    ModelName      \"Unknown\"\n    HorizSync       28.0 - 33.0\n    VertRefresh     43.0 - 72.0\n    Option         \"DPMS\"\nEndSection\n\nSection \"Device\"\n    Identifier     \"Device0\"\n    Driver         \"nvidia\"\n    VendorName     \"NVIDIA Corporation\"\n    BoardName      \"GeForce 210\"\nEndSection\n\nSection \"Screen\"\n    Identifier     \"Screen0\"\n    Device         \"Device0\"\n    Monitor        \"Monitor0\"\n    DefaultDepth    24\n    SubSection     \"Display\"\n        Depth       24\n    EndSubSection\nEndSection\n\n\nSection \"Monitor\"\n    Identifier     \"Monitor1\"\n    VendorName     \"Unknown\"\n    ModelName      \"Unknown\"\n    HorizSync       28.0 - 33.0\n    VertRefresh     43.0 - 72.0\n    Option         \"DPMS\"\nEndSection\n\nSection \"Device\"\n    Identifier     \"Device1\"\n    Driver         \"intel\"\n    VendorName     \"Intel\"\n    BoardName      \"Internal Intel Graphics\"\nEndSection\n\nSection \"Screen\"\n    Identifier     \"Screen1\"\n    Device         \"Device1\"\n    Monitor        \"Monitor1\"\n    DefaultDepth    24\n    SubSection     \"Display\"\n        Depth       24\n    EndSubSection\nEndSection\n\nBut it is still not working.\n\n\n*\n\n*Is this generally possible to use two different drivers in X ?\n\n*Is it necessary to create an xorg.conf manually then? (because Ubuntu 12.10 normally works without the xorg.conf)\n\n*Are there any errors in my xorg.conf?\n\n\nA: Yes, X can use multiple drivers.  Yours is a very similar setup as what I have.  I have an NVIDIA 9800 GT with two monitors connected and an 2nd generation intel card with a single monitor.\nI don't see any problems with your xorg.conf.  I suspect that you will need to create an xorg.conf if only to tell X to use both nvidia and intel drivers.  My xorg.conf looks very much like yours; I have three monitor and screen sections because the nvidia card has two monitors, but I'm pretty sure that X is ignoring those sections.\nFirst, you will want to make sure that xinerama is disabled in xorg.conf (maybe not necessary).\nxorg.conf:\nSection \"ServerFlags\"\n    Option  \"xinerama\"  \"off\"\nEndSection\n\nWhen you do a xrandr --listproviders you should see both cards.\ncody@IRIS> xrandr --listproviders\nProviders: number : 2\nProvider 0: id: 0x290 cap: 0x1, Source Output crtcs: 2 outputs: 5 associated providers: 1 name:NVIDIA-0\nProvider 1: id: 0x48 cap: 0xb, Source Output, Sink Output, Sink Offload crtcs: 3 outputs: 6 associated providers: 1 name:Intel\n\nIf you don't see both cards, you probably are missing a driver. (But OP says console is using one and X is using the other, so they probably both work)\nYou should be able to use xrandr --setprovideroutputsource to add the Intel ports to the list shown by your xrandr | grep conn\nIn my case I use the names given by --listproviders:\nxrandr --setprovideroutputsource Intel NVIDIA-0\n\nIf that doesn't add the Intel ports, it may be already connected in a way you can't see it.  Disconnect it with:\nxrandr --setprovideroutputsource Intel 0x0\n\nThen try to connect it again:\nxrandr --setprovideroutputsource Intel NVIDIA-0\n\nAll of the output ports should be shown now.  And you should be able to add a display with the gnome display settings or with xrandr.\nSo when I finally got my intel display working, the nvidia displays decided that they needed to pan when I tried to move the mouse to the third display.  It would now show the third monitor's content both on the third and second monitor.  And the second's original content slid over to the first monitor with the first's content off-screen.  It would slide back to normal if I tried to move the cursor over to the first monitor again.\nI finally fixed that with another xrandr call:\nxrandr --output DVI-I-2 --panning 3840x1200+1680+0/1920x1200+1680+0/0/0/0/0\n\nThis call requires knowledge of the physical screen geometry and logical layout.  I have a 1680x1050 monitor, a 1920x1200, and a 1920x1080.  They are in that order from left-to-right.  The right most is connected to the intel card.\nThis call is setting the panning region on the middle monitor.  --output DVI-I-2 happens to be the port connected to my middle monitor.\nThe first four numbers set the panning region to the total of the middle and right screens. 3840x1200 as width and height and +1680+0 to offset the region to start at top-left on the middle monitor. (Apparently [0,0] is at the top-left of the left monitor)\nThe next 4 numbers are the cursor tracking region.  I set this to only track the cursor on the middle screen.  This way when the cursor leaves this screen, it doesn't try to shift the image to follow the cursor.\nThe last 4 numbers define a border around the panning region.  I'm just using the default values here.\nVersions of related software I was using:\nxorg-server-1.17.4\ngnome-3.18.0\nxrandr-1.4.3\n\n", "Q: UPS beeping on mouse scroll or other events I have this hardware problem, my UPS battery beeps a lot when using Ubuntu (not so much on windows), so I am thinking that it may be a interrupt problem or a power surge of some sort. The strange thing is that is happening even when I do a mouse scroll, or play a video on full screen or other strange seemingly unrelated events.\nAny suggestions?\nI can post some configs if you think they can be useful.\n\nA: CPU rates would jump during scroll but does this happen when you rotate the mousewheel wheel on something that doesn't scroll? \nIf it doesn't it's probably a hardware issue with the PSU or the UPS not being able to deal with the CPU changing power states. It's probably a sign that one or both is faulty or just overloaded. Testing the second is easiest: unplug a load of stuff and test again.\n... But if you still get beeps aside from CPU-intensive things, I've really no idea. Some sort of interrupt crossover but again, no idea how that could happen.\n", "Q: How do I not resolve unmet dependencies?

This may break things if they actually depended on something and you're faking it.\nI've already answered this here: How to trick apt dependencies? but you would need to edit the control so that you had a \"provides: zeitgeist\" line in there somewhere (check the syntax on that too!)\n", "Q: How do install glassfish on ubuntu server 12.x?

When I selected Install Ubuntu I see that the installer hasn't recognised Windows 8 on the drive and only gives me options to erase the entire disk or to do \"something else\".\n\nI've seen that it recognises other partitions but it doesn't correctly find Windows 8.\n\nIn this situation, how can I safely install Ubuntu 12.10 alongside Windows 8\n\nA: I shrinked one partition using the Windows Disk Management to have free and unallocated space. Booting up the installer via USB I selected \"Something else\" and created a 4GB swap partition where I had my freed space and the root partition for Ubuntu (in my case 13.04). However it will happen, that GRUB will not be able to boot Windows properly after the installation. This issue can be fixed by using Boot-Repair which will handle everything.\nHere is even a video tutorial which is basically describing what I have done though it is done in a virtual machine without UEFI but the process of the setup should be same. Moreover Boot-Repair is a one-click tool which shouldn't need any specific description.\nKeep in mind, that GRUB is probably going to overwrite your Windows boot files.\nEDIT: Considering this post it seems possible to install GRUB on the partition where you install Ubuntu, such that it doesn't mess with Windows. Using UEFI you can then choose which OS to boot which sounds pretty nice and makes it easy to delete Ubuntu and GRUB if necessary.\n\nA: Look at your partitions.  You have no free space to install Ubuntu, so the installer does not offer that option.  The only things left are the \"erase disk\", or \"something else\", meaning you fix the partitions manually for the installation.  It is recommended that you shrink a Windows partition to create the free space from within Windows, then run chkdsk a few times before running the install.  With free space, you should be offered additional choices for installation.\n\nA: The same problem happened to me when I install Ubuntu 16.04. Then I created partition using \"AOMEI Partition Assistant\", \"and install alongside with Windows\" option appeared. If you are using Rufus in order to create bootable usb, you can also try to change \"create bootable disk using\" to \"DD image\" option. Disabling fast startup in Windows 8 and secure boot in BIOS menu are other possible solutions.\n", "Q: Dual monitor Ubuntu 12.04 - only one monitor works at a time Let me preface this by saying I've been searching and hacking at this for a week. I've tried everything that I've ready (that I understand) on the site here and plenty of other sites. I've been a Linux/Ubuntu user for many years but I don't mess with Xorg or video setup in Linux very often so my experience in that area might be a bit lacking. That being said.\nProblem: I have an HP Compaq desktop with an onboard video card (Intel), an NVidia card, and an ATI card. I can not get more than any one of them to work at a time however they all will work separately. I can change the default boot display in BIOS and change the one that is used but this doesn't do me much good.\nGoal: I have two monitors and I would like to run them both as an extended setup with two separate desktop spaces that I can use. I would like to run this in GNOME.\nI've Tried: All of the different drivers I can find and think of. I don't think this is the problem tho because I can see when I list the devices that they have drivers activated but not used. I've attempted removing all drivers and only installing the XOrg ones, also tried just using Nouveau, just Nvidia, just ATI, etc... combinations of these. The nvidia-settings tool says that no drivers are in use so that doesn't do me any good. I've tried dpkg-reconfigure -phigh xserver-org which just just puts me back on Unity instead of GNOME. I can't figure out why this happens. If I delete the xorg.conf and reboot I do get my GNOME back.\nThe regular display control panel only shows one display no matter what I've done. The additional drivers panel currently has the _nvidia_96_ driver installed. When I try to install the unsupported Nvidia driver it tells me that I have broken packages however I don't believe I do.\nI'm not sure what to try any longer and had started trying things randomly so I figured it might be time to reach out for a little help.\nBelow is some info that I generally see provided in video configuration help threads like mine. Please let me know if I can provide any other info that might help determine what needs to be done here.\nThanks in advance!\nHelpful Info:\nroot@flop:~# lshw -C video | grep product\n  product: RV370 5B60 [Radeon X300 (PCIE)]\n  product: RV370 [Radeon X300SE]\n  product: NV18 [GeForce4 MX 4000]\n\nroot@flop:~# lspci | grep VGA\n07:04.0 VGA compatible controller: NVIDIA Corporation NV18 [GeForce4 MX 4000] (rev c1)\n20:00.0 VGA compatible controller: Advanced Micro Devices [AMD] nee ATI RV370 5B60 [Radeon X300 (PCIE)]\n\nroot@flop:~# xrandr\nScreen 0: minimum 320 x 200, current 1600 x 1200, maximum 4096 x 4096\nDVI-0 connected 1600x1200+0+0 (normal left inverted right x axis y axis) 367mm x 275mm\n   1600x1200      60.0*+\n   1280x1024      75.0     60.0  \n   1152x864       75.0  \n   1024x768       75.1     60.0  \n   800x600        75.0     60.3  \n   640x480        75.0     60.0  \n   720x400        70.1  \nS-video disconnected (normal left inverted right x axis y axis)\n\n\n07:04.0 VGA compatible controller [0300]: NVIDIA Corporation NV18 [GeForce4 MX 4000] [10de:0185] (rev c1) (prog-if 00 [VGA controller])\n    Subsystem: Jaton Corp Device [1b13:0000]\n    Control: I/O- Mem+ BusMaster+ SpecCycle- MemWINV- VGASnoop- ParErr- Stepping- SERR- FastB2B- DisINTx-\n    Status: Cap+ 66MHz+ UDF- FastB2B+ ParErr- DEVSEL=medium >TAbort- <TAbort- <MAbort- >SERR- <PERR- INTx-\n    Latency: 32 (1250ns min, 250ns max)\n    Interrupt: pin A routed to IRQ 20\n    Region 0: Memory at f8000000 (32-bit, non-prefetchable) [size=16M]\n    Region 1: Memory at e8000000 (32-bit, prefetchable) [size=128M]\n    [virtual] Expansion ROM at f9040000 [disabled] [size=128K]\n    Capabilities: [60] Power Management version 2\n        Flags: PMEClk- DSI- D1- D2- AuxCurrent=0mA PME(D0-,D1-,D2-,D3hot-,D3cold-)\n        Status: D0 NoSoftRst- PME-Enable- DSel=0 DScale=0 PME-\n    Kernel driver in use: nvidia\n    Kernel modules: nvidia_96, nouveau, nvidiafb\n\n20:00.0 VGA compatible controller [0300]: Advanced Micro Devices [AMD] nee ATI RV370 5B60 [Radeon X300 (PCIE)] [1002:5b60] (prog-if 00 [VGA controller])\n    Subsystem: Advanced Micro Devices [AMD] nee ATI Device [1002:0f02]\n    Control: I/O+ Mem+ BusMaster+ SpecCycle- MemWINV- VGASnoop- ParErr- Stepping- SERR- FastB2B- DisINTx+\n    Status: Cap+ 66MHz- UDF- FastB2B- ParErr- DEVSEL=fast >TAbort- <TAbort- <MAbort- >SERR- <PERR- INTx-\n    Latency: 0, Cache Line Size: 64 bytes\n    Interrupt: pin A routed to IRQ 48\n    Region 0: Memory at f0000000 (32-bit, prefetchable) [size=64M]\n    Region 1: I/O ports at 1100 [size=256]\n    Region 2: Memory at f9100000 (32-bit, non-prefetchable) [size=64K]\n    [virtual] Expansion ROM at f9120000 [disabled] [size=128K]\n    Capabilities: [50] Power Management version 2\n        Flags: PMEClk- DSI- D1+ D2+ AuxCurrent=0mA PME(D0-,D1-,D2-,D3hot-,D3cold-)\n        Status: D0 NoSoftRst- PME-Enable- DSel=0 DScale=0 PME-\n    Capabilities: [58] Express (v1) Endpoint, MSI 00\n        DevCap: MaxPayload 128 bytes, PhantFunc 0, Latency L0s <128ns, L1 <2us\n            ExtTag+ AttnBtn- AttnInd- PwrInd- RBE- FLReset-\n        DevCtl: Report errors: Correctable- Non-Fatal- Fatal+ Unsupported-\n            RlxdOrd+ ExtTag- PhantFunc- AuxPwr- NoSnoop+\n            MaxPayload 128 bytes, MaxReadReq 128 bytes\n        DevSta: CorrErr- UncorrErr- FatalErr- UnsuppReq- AuxPwr- TransPend-\n        LnkCap: Port #0, Speed 2.5GT/s, Width x16, ASPM L0s L1, Latency L0 <128ns, L1 <1us\n            ClockPM- Surprise- LLActRep- BwNot-\n        LnkCtl: ASPM Disabled;

'Password' appears, but it won't let me type anything. What is my login? I remember being asked to set a password, but not a login name.\n\nA: \nRebooted the system and up came Ubuntu Login:\n\nDuring installation you should have been prompted to create the first user.  That's the username you should be entering.\n\n'Password' appears, but it won't let me type anything? \n\nThat's because Ubuntu won't show the password on the screen (even as you type it).\nIf you can't remember your username or password, then you need to boot into recovery mode as described here: How can I re-instate my admin privileges?.\nFrom there, you should be able to add a user account (and set its password) for normal use:\nadduser myUserName\n\nGive it a password and provide any other info asked.\nAdding user `myUserName' ...\nAdding new group `myUserName' (1001) ...\nAdding new user `myUserName' (1001) with group `myUserName' ...\nCreating home directory `/home/myUserName' ...\nCopying files from `/etc/skel' ...\nEnter new UNIX password: \nRetype new UNIX password: \npasswd: password updated successfully\nChanging the user information for myUserName\nEnter the new value, or press ENTER for the default\n    Full Name []: tester\n    Room Number []: \n    Work Phone []: \n    Home Phone []: \n    Other []: \nIs the information correct?

If you find one but you're unsure of that user's password, reset it:\npasswd myUserName\n\nThen reboot and login as your new user.  \n\nA: *\n\n*At the same place where you inserted the password it also asked for a user name.\n\n*You can find the username by booting into resque mode from GRUB and looking in /home/ (ls -l /home). The names used there are usernames you can use to login. \n", "Q: How do I reorder buttons in the window-list (taskbar) via drag and drop? I switched from GNOME2 to XFCE and miss the feature to re-arrange the window buttons in the taskbar (window list).\nHow can I make it working?\nI use Xubuntu 12.10.\n\nA: According to a bug report this feature was introduced in XFCE 4.6, but removed again in XFCE 4.8 for the sake of code simplicity.\nAnyways - after some long discussion it was reintroduced and is available in XFCE 4.10 which comes with Ubuntu 12.10 - it just has to be enabled:\n\n\n*\n\n*Rightclick on an empty space of the task bar (or at the corner)\n\n*Choose \"properties\" in the \"Window Buttons\" context menu\n\n*Choose \"Sorting order\": \"None, allow drag-and-drop\"\n\n\nA: xfce4-panel 4.12.0:\nRight click on the panel -> Panel -> Panel Preferences -> Items tab -> Window Buttons\nPress [Edit] button.\nGo to [Appearance] tab so you can change the sorting order to \n\nNone, allow drag-and-drop\n\n", "Q: Can I configure a network interface (eth0, eth1, etc.) to be down by default, but still be available? Can I configure a network interface (eth0, eth1, etc.) to be down by default, but still be available?\nI would like my eth0 interface to be \"down\" after a fresh boot. With the option of using ifup eth0 from the command line to bring it up later.\n\nA: /etc/network/interfaces is repsonsible for getting it up.\nComment out auto eth0 (add a # in front of it) and it will not start on boot.\n", "Q: Update to latest version of OpenGL I recently installed TF2 and CS:S on my Ubuntu and it was showing nothing but a black screen (I could still hear the sounds) and after searching a bit I found out it may be my OpenGL version.\nAfter entering glxinfo|grep \"OpenGL version\" in the terminal it shows \nOpenGL version string: 2.1 Mesa 9.0\n\nThe thing is I don't know how to update it, I searched for additional drivers in software resources and none were listed (which isn't normal in my opinion) and after checking for drivers on my laptop's website I couldn't install anything because they don't have linux support.\nMy laptop is: Acer Aspire 5732z\nGraphics Card: Intel GMA 4500M\n\nA: OpenGL (and its versions) are just specifications that both drivers and applications follow to allow certain access to graphics hardware... It's not something you can upgrade directly, you upgrade the graphics driver [and/or] the application.\nThe application (TF2 et al) already support the later versions of OpenGL. Assuming the hardware can support the version of OpenGL we're talking about, it's just the Intel driver that is lagging behind at the moment.\nThe drive for serious gaming on Linux is relatively new so you could be waiting a while. If you need to play games Nvidia currently offer the most comprehensive solution, with ATI/AMD following them up. Don't get me wrong, Intel are working on this.\n\nIf you want to get ahead of the curve you can use PPA repositories to get the latest version of the graphics stack. I am not making any guarantee that this will fix your problem.\n\n\n*\n\n*https://launchpad.net/~ubuntu-x-swat/+archive/x-updates\n\n*https://launchpad.net/~xorg-edgers/+archive/ppa\nThe first will upgrade graphics drivers only. The second contains the full kernel-driver-X stack. Both can destabilise a system and even make it unbootable. If you're unfamiliar with rescuing systems (and ppa-purge) I strongly suggest you stay away from these packages.\n", "Q: Can my settings be customized automatically when I boot on battery power? Is it possible to tweak settings if and only if the computer starts on battery power?\nWhy?\nI usually work without battery, but when I use a battery I want it to last as long as possible. For that purpose I use little tweaks (granola for minimal power consumption, switching off wifi and bluetooth, and brightness settings).\nWhat?\nWhenever I boot my laptop on battery I have to manually tweak all these settings. In the beginning that was OK, but now I want these tweaks to be done automatically. What I want to be tweaked automatically when booting on battery power is\n\n*\n\n*setting the laptop in flight mode (no wifi nor bluetooth)\n\n\n*dimming the screen to 50%\n\n\n*disabling all usb inputs (I often leave a few things in usb slots, but I do not want them activated)\n\n\n*set the power mode in granola to minimal consumption (this needs sudo).\nAny ideas? A script that runs automatically when logging in on battery? Anything?\n\nA: You can insert your custom battery-saver commands to an executable file like this under folder \"/etc/pm/power.d\":\n#!/bin/bash\nif on_ac_power; then\n    : # Do nothing\nelse\n    rfkill block bluetooth # Turn OFF bluetooth\nfi\nexit 0\n\nYou can see a list of other options using PowerTOP utility.\n", "Q: Find defined shortcuts in XFCE? I am using the PHPstorm IDE (java software, run with oracle java 7) which defines the shortcuts Ctrl+F12 and Alt+F8 which are not working.\nOther shortcuts do work, so I think there might be some kind of shortcut conflict wit XFCE.\nActually nothing (no XFCE action) is happening when pressing one of these combos.\nUnder Settings -> Keyboard -> Application Shortcuts none of this shorts is used.\nAre there any other places which could cause shortcut problems?\n\nA: Look in the Window Manager settings, Keyboard tab. That has more keyboard shortcuts in addition to the ones in the keyboard application shortcuts.\nOn my XFCE config (xubuntu 12.10), Alt+F8 is assigned to \"Stick window\". Ctrl+F12 is assigned to \"Workspace 12\".\n", "Q: FLareget wont show any file on the list after reboot I am using flare-get as download manager on my Ubuntu 12.10 OS. I am downloading a large file for a long time. Due to some reason in the middle of download i had to restart my PC. I pause my running download and restart it and after that I couldn't find any file on it's list. I don't know why. It happens all the time. Is there any problem on settings? Or how could I resume that one.\n\nA: There doesn't seem to be any issue with resuming. I hope you are using the latest version. You can try exiting the flareget before restarting your PC.\nPlease note: This website is not meant for particular software related issues. Most of the applications provide their own support. The better place to ask this question will be Report FlareGet Issues\n", "Q: Wubi install works but clean install hangs I did a wubi install of ubuntu 12.10 on my Windows 8 PC. It installed flawlessly however it was running a little to slow so I decided to wipe win8 completely and try a clean install of Ubuntu 12.10 x64 from a dvd. \nAfter selecting my language option at the installation menu I then select the option \"Install Ubuntu\". The screen then goes black for a second, then I see the ubuntu logo in the center of the screen with a purple background. At this screen there are some progress \"bubbles\" below the logo which light up from left to right as it appears to be loading. Then randomly the bubbles stop lighting up and the installation stops. I've left it at this screen for several hours at a time and it does nothing, just frozen. I have tried setting the acpi, noacpi, and nomodeset options but none of them get me any further.\nI figured there may be a problem with the HD so I swapped it out with a brand new 500Gb disk. Same problem. I am running on a dell studio 1458 laptop with core i5 processor 8 Gb of ram. I have also tried installing v12.04 LTS and Fedora 18. All three get to the loading screen and then freeze. Installing Windows again works flawlessly. Any ideas?\n\nA: Probably a bad burn on the DVD. Check the MD5SUM and burn it again. \nOr boot from the DVD, hit the space bar when you see the keyboard icon appear (bottom centre), select your language and then \"Check disk for errors\" from the extended menu. If it's bad download, check and burn a new one at the slowest possible speed.\nIf it worked on Wubi it should work on a normal - there is no difference with the hardware (just the installation, virtual disk and boot technique).\n", "Q: how can I revert to previous version of flash? The other day I applied updates and broke my ability to watch amazon videos on my computer. I am not alone. See the amazon forum post. \nHow can I rever to the previous version of Flash?\nHere's what I've tried so far. Using\ntail -10 /var/log/dpkg.log\n\nI found this line that looks like the culprit on my system:\n2013-04-10 16:31:56 status installed flashplugin-installer:amd64 11.2.202.280ubuntu0.12.10.1\n\nAt this point, I'm not sure what to do. And I think the issue is complicated by the fact that the package I'm referring to is an installer, not an actual plugin. \n\nA: Here is the fix:\n\n\n*\n\n*Close running instances of your browser.\n\n*If you don't already have synaptic package manager installed (it isn't by default) install it. From the terminal type:\nsudo apt-get install synaptic\n\n\n*You will also need to install \"hal\" and \"hal-info\", unless already installed:\nsudo apt-get install hal hal-info\n\n\n*Start Synaptic Package Manager\n\n*In the top right of the application is a search box. Search for \"flashplugin-installer\"\n\n*Highlight the package and press Ctrl + E\n\n*The \"Force version\" window should open\n\n*Pick version 11.2.202.243 instead of the currently installed 11.2.202.280\n\n*Apply changes by clicking the button that says \"Apply\" with a check mark under it.\n\n*With the package still highlighted, select from the top menu: Package->Lock Version\n\n*Close Synaptic and open a terminal\n\n*We need to remove old cached versions of the plugin. First type:\n cd ~/.adobe/Flash_Player\n\n\n*Next type: \n rm -rf NativeCache AssetCache APSPrivateData2\n\n\n*You can now close the terminal and reopen your browser\n\n\nThanks to Rob S for the instructions on how to do this. The above instructions are his with only slight modifications. Additionally, the last few instructions are from the Arch Linux Wiki.\n\nA: I use the adobe-flashplugin package instead of the flashplugin-installer package, so I fixed it a different way; I downloaded the old .deb file for the adobe-flashplugin package and installed it with dpkg:\nwget http://launchpadlibrarian.net/134077901/adobe-flashplugin_11.2.202.275-0precise1_amd64.deb\nsudo dpkg -i adobe-flashplugin_11.2.202.275-0precise1_amd64.deb\n\nI'm using 12.04 (precise); you can find the appropriate download urls for other ubuntu releases by following the links here:\nhttps://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/adobe-flashplugin\nOne big drawback to doing it like this is that apt-get will refuse to install or update any other packages until you upgrade your adobe-flashplugin package back to the latest version with this command:\nsudo apt-get -f upgrade adobe-flashplugin\n\nHopefully amazon fixes their flash player soon.\n", "Q: i cant boot my installed ubuntu i can't boot the installed ubuntu 12.0 on my toshiba sateliteL750 . it only boot from the preinstalled os (win7) and i want it to be alongside with different disk partition.\n  there is no multiple option to boot for other oss.\n\nA: Ubuntu came with GRUB on it, so it will only load if it's the primary boot device.\nGo into the BIOS and into the Boot Device Order.\nSelect Ubuntu's drive (It's usally /dev/sda2, but to make sure, run a LiveCD and run in a terminal fdisk) and put it in the order as the first boot device.\nSave the changes and reboot.\nHopefully GRUB will come up and you will be able to choose between Windows and Ubuntu.\nHope this helps!!!\n", "Q: Change permissions on all folders and files I have ubuntu 12.04. I want to change permissions on all folders and files at the same time so that anyone can modify or remove them.\n\nA: First important point you do not want to change the permissions on all files and folders: changing the permissions on some files can break your system.\nCommand Line Way\nSo lets assume instead you want to change the the permissions in all the files in a particular folder and its sub-folders.\nI have a folder in my home directory which does not give any access to \"others\"; this contains a sub-folder sub which also does not give any access to others.\n\nIf I now want to give \"others\" read access I make sure I am in the correct directory and enter \nchmod -R o+r *\n\nAs you can see the permissions are changed\n\nIf you only want to do this in the current directory omit -R from the command.\nIf you want to do this in a directory you don't own you will need to prefix the command with sudo \nGUI way\nIf the files are owned by you run the file manager if not press ALT+F2\nType gksu nautilus and enter your password when requested.\nHold down the SHIFT key or  CTRL key to select the files you want: SHIFT selects all the files in a range CTRL selects one file at a time.  Now right click and select properties; in the window that opens you can select the permissions tab and you can set the permissions from there.\n\nA: If you are talking about your home folder or any shared folder then you can chmod -R 777 /Your/folder/path/. If you just want to make the files read and write enabled then I would set the permissions to 766 instead.\nThis said, for this to work, your partition entry in the fstab file must permit read/write and execute permissions.\n", "Q: Ubuntu 12.10 flickering with AMD Radeon HD 6625M I let my the software update update the kernel. but when it restarted, it started to flicker and flash the screen. I can only hear the login screen sound. I can restore this by selecting the old kernel from grub. How do I fix it? Or at least someone tell me how to make it boot from the old kernel automatically.\n\nA: You could try editing the Grub boot menu. Look for \"gfxmode $linux_gfx_mode\". If you have this try changing it to \"gfxmode 800x600\" to force the boot resolution to a value which is more likely to work.\nIf you are having this problem on a laptop then for a quick fix try closing the lid to send it to \"Sleep\" then open it again after a few seconds to wake it up. You should then see the login screen.\nFor any newbies, I have posted a more detailed explanation of the steps required to modify this entry in your Grub menu at Screen flickering in Ubuntu 12.04 LTS.\n", "Q: Readpst works nonsatisfying Is somebody able to help me?\nI use MS-OUTLOOK 2010 under Windows 7 and I would like to use contacts and appointments saved in Outlook in Evolution 3.2.2. too.\nTherefore I installed „readpst“ from the Ubuntu Software-Center and I used it equal to the todo on the Ubuntu-homepage: Import PST in Evolution 3.2.1\nAt first sight contacts and appointments are transfered acceptably. But on closer inspection it appears that my contacts which have birthday before 1st of January 1970 their birthdays are fixed on 01.01.1970. Because the most of my contacts are older than 43 years hardly any Birthday is false. That is not acceptable for me.\nIs there any other way to import PST-Data into Evolution?\nMany thanks for your assistance.\nBest regards\nDietmar\n\nA: Have you tried importing the pst file directly through Evolution? Evolution 3.2.2 should be able to import pst files directly. This function should be available in package 3.2.2-0ubuntu2 and later.\nEvolution >> File >> Import\nIn the Evolution Import Assistant, chose Import a single file under Importer Type. After that, you can specify the file name and the file type (.pst).\nThe catch is that the Evolution plug-ins use the same libpst4 library to perform the import that readpst uses. Dates before Jan 1, 1970 are more likely to have problems converting. I would guess that birthdays are probably the only dates you have in your pst file that go back that far, so that's where you see the conversion problem.\nThe Evolution plug-in, however, converts dates with a different method than readpst does and appears to correctly handle the conversion of dates from a Windows format to a Unix format.\nI suspect you are running into 1 of 2 possible problems:\n1) Date format. If you are using DD/MM, libpst4 doesn't appear to adjust for this (though I could be wrong). The result is that the date conversion fails. If this is the case, you may be able to adjust Outlook (or locale settings) before creating the pst file.\n2) 32- vs 64-bit issues. Although libpst4 can read a 64-bit pst file, it uses a structure to store the datetime that does not appear to guarantee (again, I could be wrong) that a 64-bit datetime is converted correctly.\nIf you try the pst file with Evolution directly and it still doesn't work, and none of this helps you solve the problem, your best option might be using another file format.\nYou can export the Outlook file as csv, tab, etc and Evolution can also import those files through the Import Assistant. \n", "Q: Persona issues in LibreOffice 4.0.2.2 Just wondering are there any issues with the personas in LO 4.0.2.2??

What is the best way to save my current information and change the disk and possibly the OS?\n\nA: The answers provided in this question: How to move Ubuntu installation from one hdd to another? may be useful for you. Of which I will reproduce here my own answer for your convenience.\n\nClonezilla may be useful for cloning your hard disk, even for those situations on which you need to do it with different size disks\n  as mentioned here:\n  http://www.tuxradar.com/content/how-clone-hard-drives-clonezilla\n\n\nMoving to a bigger disk\nIt's easy to ensure that a clone of a SCSI\n    disk is restored to a SCSI disk, but you'll have a tough time finding\n    an exact replica size-wise. The good news is you don't have to restore\n    a disk on another disk of the same size. The even better news is that\n    you can in fact restore the image to a much larger disk.\nWhen restoring a disk, Clonezilla enables you to resize the filesystem\n    and create partitions on the new disk proportionally. But even if you\n    are moving to a bigger disk, you might prefer to keep the partitions\n    as they are. In that case you can ask Clonezilla to create the\n    partition table as its listed in the image.\n\nThere is documentation about moving to a larger disk as mentioned here\n  but I am not sure that you can do it the opposite (cloning to a\n  smaller disk).\nHowever, it's worth to try. Clonezilla offers several Live CD's and\n  bootable USB images and there is also documented that you can resize\n  the free space on the disk after the copy, in which case the\n  suggestion by @maniat1k to use gparted is also a good idea.\nIf you use clonezilla, I would appreciate if you drop comments with\n  your experiences over here in order to have well documented how does\n  this work for future reference.\n\nI hope this help you.\nGood luck!\n", "Q: Questions about architecture So, I've been trying to learn as much as I can about linux operating systems, and something is currently confusing me.\nuname -a\nLinux L655 3.5.0-27-generic #46-Ubuntu SMP Mon Mar 25 19:58:17 UTC 2013 x86_64 x86_64 x86_64 GNU/Linux\n\nOkay, so my system is x86_64, which means it is 32bit, correct?

Its primary purpose is moving files and folders, but it can also rename them since the act of renaming a file is interpreted by the filesystem as moving it from one name to another.\nThe syntax is:\nmv (option) file1.ext file2.ext\n\nwhere “file1.ext” is the “old” name of the file, and “file2.ext” the new name.\nAnd to remove, you can use the command:\nrm -f filename\n\nHope that helped.\n", "Q: internet wont connect despite working wireless/ethernet I have 12.10 installed on a partitioned drive along with windows 7 on a new gateway pc.

Make sure that it IS actively monitoring temps and controlling fan speeds and cooling.\nIt's possible that a video controller or your chipset or something is not using the correct driver in linux.  If this is the case, I'd say start by going into Software Sources in Ubuntu and seeing about using different video drivers (like for NVidia cards, there's at least five different sources for drivers and only one or two of them are NVidia).\nA chipset driver might make sense as this is where your power management tends to take place.

I use lightdm to log in, and have some Gnome components running (I have gnome-panel and a number of dependencies), but I use neither Gnome nor Unity as a desktop environment (I start the Sawfish window manager manually).\n20 seconds is ridiculously fast: in practice the disk keeps powering down and back up immediately, which is slow (bad user experience), potentially damaging the drive (though I've never been able to find concrete data abouth this), and actually consumes more energy when the spun-down time is very short (a 2008 analysis found that for a particular disk, standby mode saved energy if it lasted for more than 9s; mine often last less).\nTherefore I want to increase this timeout. How can I do this? I don't know what software is causing the spindown.\nLooking at the running processes, I only see upowerd which might be related to power management. Killing it makes no difference.\nThe timeout probably comes from the disk itself: hdparm -I /dev/sda reports “Advanced power management level: 1” (which doesn't match the 20 seconds, as it should mean 5 seconds according to the hdparm documentation…).

According to the requirements for uploading an application to the Software Center,\n\nWrite all configuration settings to ~/.config/ (This can be one file or a directory containing multiple configuration files)\n\nBy default, it appears that KDE applications store configuration files in ~/.kde/share/config/<name>rc. Is this not allowed? If so, how do I change where the file is stored? I'm using KConfig XT. The tutorial says\n\nStart that file by opening the  tag which controls which KConfig file the data will be stored in. There are three possibilities:\n\n*\n\n*If the <kcfgfile> tag has no attributes the generated code will use the application's default KConfig file (normally $HOME/.kde/config/<appname>rc).\n\n*The \"name\" attribute is used to manually specify a file name. If the value assigned to \"name\" is not an absolute file path, the file will be created in the default KDE config directory (normally $HOME/.kde/config).\n\n*If you would like to be able to specify the config file at construction time, use <kcfgfile arg=\"true\">. This causes the constructor of the generated class to take a KSharedConfig::Ptr as an argument, allowing you to construct multiple instances pointing to different files.\n\n\nI've tried setting the name attribute to be ~/.config/<appname>, but there is no file at that location, although settings are still being saved. Also, when I set the name attribute, other settings are still saved to ~/.kde/share/config/<appname>rc, such as window size.\nHow to I change where configuration data is stored for a KDE app so it will meet upload requirements for the Software Center?\n\nA: If you are using the KConfig API, your application should be fine for uploading to MyApps and inclusion in the store.\nYou could also instead use the Qt bindings for dconf, dconf-qt, which would allow you to store your settings in dconf, which would be under the ~/.config/ directory.\nAlso note that the ~/.config/ requirement is perhaps not well specified in those requirements, as it should be $XDG_CONFIG_HOME instead, for which ~/.config/ is simply the default, and which users may decide to change to another location, so that the files underneath it, may be more easily accessible to them.\n", "Q: Prevent option popup when launching a bash application when I double click on my bash (.sh) application Ubuntu asks me if I would like to reun the application in the terminal, just run the app or display its contents.

That way, (g)vim changes to the directory of the current file at start, which means, unlike with autochdir, no plugins get broken. Also, you can still edit a file in a subdirectory and still run commands in the working directory.\nThat means, when you have you bibfile in a subdirectory, you could edit it and run bibtex while you have that file still open.

Where can I configure the system to have full options?\n\nA: I'm using 13.04 but I think it's similar to 12.10 in this regard.\nYou will need to specify the connection metho in the box that appears:\n\n\n*\n\n*for secure ftp/ssh: sftp://user@serverip\n\n*for samba (windows network share): smb://user@serverip\n\n*etc.\n\n\n\nNB it will save your connection settings in the \"Recent Servers\" section so you don't have to re-enter them each time\n", "Q: GTK+ within Python 2 and 3 Can GTK+ with Python create app on Ubuntu OS?\n\nA: Yes of course, you can develop applications both in Python 2 and Python 3 with PyGtk.\nCheck here how to use PyGtk for Python 3 or here for Python 2\nAlso you can use Quickly (video) which will generate much of the boilerplate code and make your project easier to release.\n", "Q: Why does KDE not show up following install kubuntu-desktop?

I've been using CGIHTTPServer but it requires a cgi-bin folder in which to run the scripts. I want something that can run in the home folder but doesn't require LAMP to be installed. Thanks guys.\n\nA: Unfortunately you will have to install a server but not a LAMP stack (Linux, Apache, MySql, PHP), just a webserver that is either Apaceh, Nginx or whatever server you like.\nPython's CGIHTTPServer require the cgi-bin folder.

It's a little confusing because (I know what compiling actually does - high level language to binary) sometimes you have to make, sometimes you have to ./configure, ect.\nNot to mention you have to keep the files all in the same folder you compiled in, which is really annoying because I dont know if additional files are being moved somewhere on my system, and I can't delete them simply by removing the folder which I compiled in...\nAnyways, at one point or another I probably sounded really stupid trying to explain my understanding - \ntl;dr\nHow do I turn source code into something my package manager can use for automatic updating with apt?\n\nA: *\n\n*A \"package manager\" does not take a source tree and excrete packages. A package manager (apt+dpkg in our case) literally stores a list of available packages, their URLs and their dependencies, as well as keeping track of what is already installed.\n\n*The packages are produced by compiling and then packaging. This can either be done by hand (as you start to mention)...\n\n*Or by creating a build recipe which instructs Launchpad on how to build and package your source. The advantage of the second is Launchpad can keep updating and keep building as the source changes.\n\n*What I've just described is completely non-beginner stuff. You need to learn certain elements of Launchpad (creating a LP branch and PPA, importing the github code, creating the recipe and snaggling all that together)\n\n*./configure, make and then sudo make install (or sudo checkinstall) is by far an easier way to get an application built and installed. If you use checkinstall you'll even have a package built to make removing it or upgrading slightly easier.\nI know that doesn't really answer everything, but it does answer some of it. I believe just a bit of checkinstall should get you to a happy middleground without having to learn the Debian Packagers' Handbook.\n\nA: To get an automatic message of a new update someone will have to upload the new version to the repository. \nIf you manually check for updates, compile, create a packages and update the repository; then yes. Easy as pie. (Except for all the work of baking that pie maintaining that package)\nIf noon keeps the repository updated: Nope.\n", "Q: Mount bind with full ownership and permissions I am using 12.10 on virtualbox.

Any ideas?\nThanks in advance.\n\nA: Unselect the automount option in the virtual machine settings.\nTo mount the folder manually, run this on a terminal:\nsudo mount -t vboxsf -o uid=1000,gid=1000 Documents /media/D/Leinardo/Documents\n\nTo mount it automatically, add this line to /etc/fstab:\nDocuments /media/D/Leinardo/Documents vboxsf uid=1000,gid=1000 0 0\n\n\nA: You should use a bind mount with the user/owner option. A bind mount does not take uid or gid.\nThe bind mount will apply the permissions from the user or owner directory to the mount. \nThe mount point should be owned by root. The user directory should be set up as desired.\nAdd this line to /etc/fstab:\n/media/D/Leinardo/Documents Documents none bind,user 0 2\n\n(Original reference)\nhttps://superuser.com/q/623375/179826\n", "Q: Environment var _ I send a printenv command in the commandline and I see one of the variables is the following:\n_=/usr/bin/printenv\n\nI now do this:\nmo@mo-Toshiba ~/Workspace $ printenv _\n/usr/bin/printenv\n\nbut when trying to call echo on this variable I get the following:\nmo@mo-Toshiba ~/Workspace $ echo $_\n_\n\nWhat gives? Why doesn't echo treat this as a variable? (ie. like $PATH or $PWD)\n\nA: It is a variable. The shell variable _ is updated by the shell each time you run a command to contain the last argument of the previous command.\nIt isn't useful very often, but it lets you write an alias or function to perform something on “the same file (or other object) as the last command”.\nThe variable is also added to the environment of subprocesses.

Or do I need to set up a different kind of partition, or remove the partition? I'm just not sure what the initial state of the hard drive should be in order for Ubuntu to install to it.\nThanks\n\nA: \nDo I need to reformat the drive as something other than NTFS?\n\nYes, Ubuntu uses a Linux based permissions system and NTFS does not understand it. Ubuntu needs to be installed onto an ext formatted filesystem. ext4 is the newest version.\n\nand create a single, primary partition.\n\nThis will not work. You need to use partition magic (in windows) or gparted to create a second (can be unallocated) partition. If you have that you will get extra options in the installer (ie. amongst others: \"use unallocated space\").\n\nExample as shown in Windows disc manager.\n\n\n\n*\n\n*C:  NTFS Has Windows. \n\n*unallocated space. \n\n\n\nExample from Ubuntu installer.\n\n\n\n*\n\n*sda1  NTFS Has Windows.\n\n*unallocatedspace.\n\n\nYou then can use the installer to change the unallocated space into partitions with mountpoint / (everything but 2-4Gb) and swap (that is the 2-4Gb). \n\nA: I happened to have just downloaded Acronis Easy Migrate for another project and was able to use the demo version to format the drive as ext3, in two, unallocated partitions.\nWhen I put the disk back into the machine and ran the installer, it worked, and I was able to install to the drive.\nThank you!\n", "Q: Getting error installing updates (in Canada) I am trying to install updates for a Dell XPS running Ubuntu 12.04 LTS.

In that case you should try this:\nsudo ifconfig eth0 up   \nsudo dhclient eth0\n\nIf this dosen't work try eth1,2, etc. Or you can get a list of interface names by typing:\nifconfig\n\n\nA: Networking should be enabled by default. You can check this by looking at the output of the command:\nip route \n\nand \nifconfig\n\nNormally you should see your network connection in ifconfig and default from the ip route command gives you connection to the internet. If you can not find your network adaptor in ifconfig and there is no default route in ip route, then there is something wrong and more data is needed.\nHowever, I presume from the way you ask the question that your actually question might be how to browse the internet when no GUI is available. A server is not meant to do browsing, so by default no browser is installed. You can install a text based browser for very simple browsing by the command \nsudo apt-get install links\n\nNow you can browse by using the command \nlinks www.google.com\n\nFor proper browsing you will need firefox or something, which requires a graphical environment. Thought apt will probably sort out some kind of solution when you do\nsudo apt-get install firefox\n\n, you then need to start a graphical x-session by hand and tell firefox to use this. But bottom line, if you want to browse the internet, you install a desktop system and let it execute some server tasks. If your server tasks are too demanding to be executed by a desktop system, you install a server and use a different system to browse the internet. \n\nA: Networking is setup by default in your installation.  Do you have a wired connection to an Internet-connected router that provides you with an IP address or do you have wireless? IN the former case it 'should just work' in the latter case you might want to review the answer to how to configure wireless using the commandline only.\n", "Q: What automated intrusion notification/detection setup is good for home desktop use? I've been using Linux for quite a while now and I always feel the need to have a passive software / script setup which can alert me of any suspicious network activities like scans, failed login attempts, etc. on the fly via email or by visual/audio notifications.\nI know how to look up through logs and stuff but for the most part it is a manual, time consuming process. I'm looking for something that is semi/fully automated with some good log parsing capabilities.\nI'm aware of IDS systems for monitoring networks like Snort, etc. but they are an overkill for the average home user and a painful process to get up and running.\nWhat is a good option for me as a home user?\n\nA: If you don't have a lot of systems on your network, setting up an IDS like Snort is probably overkill (especially if you don't have any network services on your machine). I suggest starting by configuring logwatch to send yourself a report of what's going on on your system. Once you have that up, configure your syslog so that you get as much relevant information as possible.\n\nA: A simple and effective general solution is to use logcheck.\nsudo apt-get install logcheck\n[edit /etc/logcheck/logcheck.conf to your liking]\n\nlogcheck periodically scans all the logs efficiently (starting where it left off last time), filters what it sees to eliminate anything considered normal, and optionally emails alerts with anything that doesn't match the normal/routine patterns.\nThe main idea is to watch-out for appearance of any serious entries in your log files, all of them, all the time, so you don't have to.\nlogcheck is highly configurable (man logcheck).  You may configure everything, including:\n\n\n*\n\n*frequency of checks\n\n*which log files are checked\n\n*what is considered normal vs not\n\n*where to email the alerts (abnormal events) to\n\n\nand more. Your ignore (normal/routine) patterns reside in multiple files under /etc/logcheck/ignore.d.* and you may customize them to your needs; mainly you may want to add your own patterns to ignore.  The default Ubuntu package comes with an extensive set of files with ignore patterns for many services already, so there's not much to add unless your system is unusual in what it runs. There are 3 sets of pre-configured ignore file profiles:  ignore.d.workstation, ignore.d.server, and ignore.d.paranoid which you can pick from.\nThe main idea behind logcheck is that the various services running on a system, already log abnormal events. E.g. sshd or pam already log authentication failures.  So the main missing components are:\n\n\n*\n\n*filtering what's normal\n\n*The alerting service\n\n\nBoth of which are provided by logcheck in a convenient package.  You may combine logcheck with any other logging. For example iptables can be configured to syslog any network connection attempts that are not explicitly allowed by adding the rules:\n iptables -A input -j LOG\n iptables -A input -j DROP\n\nimmediately after all the allow rules.\nI find logcheck to be much more helpful than logwatch (suggested in other answers) because it comes pre-packaged with a very large number of rules to ignore what's considered normal activity. The result is a much higher signal/noise ratio in the alerts it emails. YMMV.\nAnother advantage of logcheck is that it is orthogonal to any service that logs, so there's no duplication of function. Whenever you add a new service which uses syslog to log events, abnormal or not, into any file under /var/log you start getting alerts for it automatically.\nHOWTO:\n\nSince logcheck already comes preconfigured, two lines at the top of\n  this answer essentially cover all you need to get started.  Just\n  install it, and go over the top configuration file:\n  /etc/logcheck/logcheck.conf to change your email address\n  so logcheck emails alerts to you.\nHere's a friendly reference going over the second step in more\n  detail.\n  Since Ubuntu is based on Debian, these instructions should work on Ubuntu too.\n  Here is another good reference.\nOnce you install, the continuous improvement process starts.\n  Over time, you refine your rules to ignore anything that you already know about\n  and feel shouldn't be of concern.\n  This refinement process is as simple as adding text lines to a file\n  in your favorite text editor.\nEach line in an ignore file is an extended regular expression (see man 7 regex), but you may use simple strings as long as they match the log line you want to ignore. Just remember that characters like *, ?, '+', [], () are special in a regular expression, so if they actually appear in the log lines, you would have to escape them with a backslash \\ in the ignore files.\nIn other words: if you get an alert you don't want to get,\n  look at the log line that was emailed to you, and add a pattern\n  that matches it, as one line to any ignore file of your choice.  I suggest using\n  /etc/logcheck/ignore.d.<yourloglevel>/my-ignores as your personal ignore\n  file. Where <yourloglevel> is one of paranoid, server, or\n  workstation (as you've already selected in\n  the main config file: /etc/logcheck/logcheck.conf).  Look at the examples in other\n  ignore files to see how to account for text that changes all the time like process-IDs, or time-stamps. There are lots of existing examples to learn from.\n\nOne last tip: logcheck comes with a little useful utility called logcheck-test which is very handy for testing new rules. man logcheck-test for details.\n\nA: Intrusion detection is needed for sure when you run services (ftp, web, nfs, ssh etc) in your network. This is because they are exposed on the internet and due to :\n\n\n*\n\n*miss-configuration\n\n*software vulnerabilities\n\n\nthey need daily monitoring by an experienced network administrator. If you run this services, you probably have already the minimum knowledge how to avoid this problems.  \nIf you don't run any of this services, then your internet router firewall, has already blocked any incoming connection on ports. To scan your networks router \n\n\n*\n\n*just visit https://www.grc.com/x/ne.dll?bh0bkyd2 \n\n*click \"proceed\" \n\n*select \"All ports\" to check for any open ports\n\n\nIf you are all green, then you are all good.\nLast but not least, probably your router has built-in Intrusion detection system (because 99% of all routers run a striped down linux server). For this, you must check the manual of your routers manufacturer.\n", "Q: iptables doesn't redirect http traffic to my Squid proxy! I arranged a transparent Squid proxy which listens to port 3128 on localhost, to block some web sites.\nI've tested the proxy using Firefox, and it works.\nThen I ran this, hoping to redirect all the http requests to the proxy:\nsudo iptables -t nat -A PREROUTING -p tcp -j REDIRECT --to-ports 3128\n\nSadly, nothing happens. The other browsers in my system don't seem to be using the proxy. I don't want to configure each browser, to use the proxy either.\nsudo iptables -L shows no rules assigned.\nI'm on Ubuntu 13.04, and using a 3G USB modem (ppp0) to connect to the Internet. Any advice is appreciated!\n\nA: I think you are missing the destination port, try following\niptables -t nat -A PREROUTING -p tcp --dport 80 -j REDIRECT --to-ports 3128\n\nWithout dport, you are forwarding traffic with destination port 3128 to local port 3128. What you want is traffic with destination port 80 forward to local port 3128.\nAdditionally, to show nat rules, use\niptables -t nat -L\n\nHowever, the above rules will not work for a transparent proxy setup on the same machine of the browser, because PREROUTING chain alters packges before routing from a remote client and it will not do anything for locally generated packets. Thus we should use OUTPUT chain for packets locally generated which are going out from the system.\nTry following instead\niptables -t nat -A OUTPUT -p tcp -m owner ! --uid-owner proxy --dport 80 -j REDIRECT --to-port 3128\n\nIt will only redirect traffic for processes other than the ones owned by proxy user.\nWithout -m owner ! --uid-owner proxy, it will not work because the rules will also caught the proxy server outgoing traffic and end up in a loop.\n", "Q: unable to load windows or its drives.

After installing a proprietary driver for my nvidia graphics card\n\ngksu nvidia-settings was run from terminal\n\nThrough which have checked the configuration of my graphics card but am unsure where to save the configuration file after attempting to save it for system to use if for example I wanted to add a second monitor or make resolution changes.\nNewer flavors do not use /etc/X11/xorg.conf and do not understand how to get the most out of my proprietary driver and graphics card.  It appears nvidia-settings only confirms how the card is being used.  Rather than its intended use of making configuration changes.  Which appears to be uʍop ǝpısdn and/or ʍɹouƃ ʍɐʎ ɹonup to me. \nAnybody want to share how to use nvidia-settings save configuration options whilst explaining how this driver works with no apparent etc/X11/xorg.conf file? (or how is system using card and driver if there is not any /etc/X11/xorg.conf file being used?)\n\nA: First I want to mention that all information saved by nvidia-settings is stored in ~/.nvidia-settings-rc which you can access by typing the following:\nnano ~/.nvidia-settings-rc\nI mention this because other users also wonder, if the xorg.conf is not used, then how is the settings for Ati or Nvidia working. The reason behind this is that X can now automatically detect and configure many aspects of what xorg.conf had before for many input/output devices, including Video cards. This did not completely happen automatically before, but since around 2010, X can handle many options and detect them without any problems or the need to configure a file for them.\nNote that, many of this are still present but divided into more specific files in /usr/share/X11/xorg.conf.d/\nNow, there are some cases, like specific Nvidia or Ati Models that need the xorg.conf to work correctly because of some variables they need that X detected incorrectly or are needed for the Nvidia/Ati card to work. The automatic detection is very good but still needs some work to cover, for example, the latest video cards.\nFor example, some video cards do not show the Unity Launcher or top panel unless xorg.conf is present. In other cases, users that want to tweak their video card, may need the Coolbits option which is added to xorg.conf. This are the reasons why nvidia-xconfig exists. To provide an additional level of support in case X does not detect or offer all the options for the video card.\nI also want to add that if you happen to edit any of the options in the Display Configuration option you will most likely need to create or have an existing xorg.conf file. This can be created by the button mentioned in the following image:\n\nOr by executing the following command in the terminal (Recommended way):\nsudo nvidia-xconfig\nAfterwards I also recommend rebooting the PC to make sure, the xorg.conf file is working correctly with the Nvidia card.\nIf however, you want to manually change the resolution, this is done in the xorg.conf file and not in the /usr/share/X11/xorg.conf.d/ folder.\nThis would then be done in the xorg.conf file in the Screen Section and it would look something similar to this:\nSection \"Screen\"\n    Identifier    \"Default Screen\"\n    Device        \"NVIDIA Corporation NV34 [GeForce FX 5200]\"\n    Monitor        \"CM752ET\"\n    DefaultDepth    16\n    SubSection \"Display\"\n        Depth        32\n        Modes      \"1024x768_75.00\"\n    EndSubSection\nEndSection\n\nWhere you can see the monitor model, the Nvidia video card and resolution (Mode) used with it's respective refresh rate (75Hz).\n", "Q: cant install a thing!

I am thinking about replacing regular Ubuntu 12.04 on my laptop with 13.04 Gnome - or Gnome Remix 12.10, given that the latter oddly has a longer life cycle as of now. Which of the two comes with the more updated state of Gnome, out of the box?\nIf the version numbers of Gnome are the same in both, are there any other differences to the Gnome-Shell experience?\nMore specifically, I am hoping for the customizations (shell extensions, user themes) to become more integrated and well-supported OOTB as development proceeds.\nCurrently, shell extensions are unofficial self-fixes that may or may not work with different versions of Gnome 3. To be able to use them, one has to install a package that isn't easy to find. Similarly, the ability to choose user themes is tied to an unofficial shell extension.\nThat is the kind of things I hope to see improved in the future, possibly even between these 2 versions of Ubuntu?\n\nA: Ubuntu GNOME is formerly known as Ubuntu GNOME Remix and is the official gnome shell flavor of ubuntu.\nRefer to wiki here\nLatest Ubuntu GNOME/Gnome Remix version is 12.10 but 13.04 Gnome Remix is around corner, and it can be upgraded into Gnome 3.8 through PPAs\n[UPDATE!] To get most updated Gnome-Shell, get latest Ubuntu version and upgrade gnome manually through PPA.

To my knowledge this does not work on 12.10 unless you add the testing and/or staging PPAs, which is risky if you care about stability.\nAs a user of Gnome 12.10 Remix, go with 13.04 and add the PPAs.

My physical keyboard layout is called Bépo, it is the French language Dvorak method-based layout.\nI would like to change my input layout to this too.\nTo do this, I tried booting in a French spoken session, then open the Keyboard Layout preferences app. Normally, to add a layout, you should click on the + sign and select your layout. However the list that appears is very short and does not contain what I want. On the contrary, on a persistent non-live installation, the choice of Bépo is present. This is also the case during an installation of Ubuntu.\nSo I do I change the keyboard layout of my live session to the correct one?\n\nA: According to own test on a Live USB session of Ubuntu 13.10, it seems to now be possible to change the keyboard layout to a non-standard one.\nThis is probably due to the introduction of a new keyboard indicator (see http://www.webupd8.org/2013/10/ubuntu-1310-available-for-download.html for instance).\n", "Q: Making batch-file for Gnuplot How can I make a batch file with a series of commandos for Gnuplot, and then execute it in Gnuplot?

If I attempt to change my password to nothing by opening \"User Accounts\", the \"Change\" button remains greyed out:\n\nHow do I change my password to be empty? I know you can set Ubuntu to automatically log you in, but I want my password to be empty, I never want to type in a password to authenticate myself as that user.\nI know that there are reasons why this might not be a good idea, but I want to know if it is even possible. I'm using Ubuntu 12.10.\n\nA: I think it's possible to do this, but will get you into trouble once you try to install updates or anything else that requires sudo; as you need an account with sudo access (and a password) in order to install.\nYour best options seem to be:\n\n\n*\n\n*Use the Guest account that doesn't have a password. Thereby leaving a default account with password.  \n\n*Hellbent on an account without password?  Strongly recommend not doing this:   Add a new user account (with password), then change it to be the equivalent as blank. To do this:\n\n\n*\n\n*create a user (either via GUI or useradd, etc).  Then, \n\n*CTRL-ALT-T to open terminal.  Next,  \n\n*gksu gedit nano -B /etc/shadow then find the new user and change the existing password hash with: U6aMy0wojraho -- so it looks something like: newuser:U6aMy0wojraho:13996:0:99999:7:::\n\n\n*Best solution to your question:  Choose to automatically log in your account, which is likely the main benefit you're after.  to do this: \n\n\n*\n\n*press CTRL-ALT-T (to open terminal).

Otherwise, sudo will ask for a password even when you don't have one, and won't accept an empty password.\nTo do so, open the sudoers configuration file with sudo visudo, and add the following line to the file, replacing david with your username:\ndavid ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD:ALL\n\nClose the editor to apply the changes, and test the effect on sudo in a new terminal.\n\n\n*Delete the password for your user by running this command:\n sudo passwd -d `whoami`\n\n\n\n*Follow the steps in this answer in order to make pkexec accept a user with no password. pkexec is used by some applications when root privileges are required.\nIf you ever get prompted for a password, just type enter and it should work. I've tested this answer with LightDM, the lock screen, sudo, gksu, and it works.\n\nA: Its a GUI interface and that is what is preventing you from making it a blank password.\nIf there was a way it would have to be done via terminal. \nBut, in the end you have to enter the system via the GUI and even if you did change the password to blank the GUI would prevent that. So unless you want to change to a non GUI interface it is simply not possible.\n\nA: Warning: Be careful once you remove your password using this method, you won't be able to authenticate yourself to prove you have admin rights, in a GUI or in the terminal (like installing an application using Synaptic, or using sudo through the command-line). This is because of bug #1168749.\nOnly do this if the user is not the only admin user.\nThis has been tested on Ubuntu 12.04 and 12.10.\n\n*\n\n*Make sure that you click on Unlock to be able to accomplish the tasks below:\n\n\n\n*Go into user accounts, and click on the password field:\n\n\n\n*Once the window opens, click on the down arrow to the right of \"Action\"...\n\n\n\n*and change it to \"Log in without a password\", and then click on \"Change\":\n\n\n\n*Optionally, you  can also enable automatic log-in, like this:\n\nTo give the user a password again after running this procedure, you can't use a GUI (bug #882255), you have to use the command-line:\n\n*\n\n*Log in as another user with admin priveleges. (Remember, the original one cannot run with admin privileges without a password using this method.)\n\n\n*Run the following in a terminal:\n sudo passwd <username>\n\nAgain, I must warn you that once you remove the password, you won't be able to authenticate yourself in the GUI or a terminal, like installing an application using Synaptic, or using sudo on the command-line.\n\nA: It is possible to change password after deletion. You need just to boot in recovery mode. Here you'll find a nice tutorial: http://www.psychocats.net/ubuntu/resetpassword\nIn short what you'll find on the link above:\n\n\n*\n\n*you have to reboot into recovery mode. \n(to get the boot menu to show, you have to hold down the Shift key during bootup)\n\n*In boot-up menu select \"Drop to root shell prompt\" option\n\n*type on console one by one\nls /home\npasswd username\npasswd susan\nexit\n\nthen reboot normal\n", "Q: What is the VESA:WRESTLER driver and why am I using it?

So much has been written that I'm kind of confused, but if I'm not mistaken Canonical is building the next generation of Unity for mobile devices with Qt, and in the near future the desktop will also be migrated to qt.\nI just wanted to know the technical and/or political reasons driving this decision, and what consequences could it mean for the currently existing Ubuntu desktop applications.\n\nA: You can find the answer on the mailing list and on Mark Shuttleworth's blog. This blog post probably answers it best:\n\nAs part of our planning for Natty+1, we’ll need to find some space on the CD for Qt libraries, and we will evaluate applications developed with Qt for inclusion on the CD and default install of Ubuntu.\nEase of use, and effective integration, are key values in our user experience. We care that the applications we choose are harmonious with one another and the system as a whole. Historically, that has meant that we’ve given very strong preference to applications written using Gtk, because a certain amount of harmony comes by default from the use of the same developer toolkit. That said, with OpenOffice and Firefox having been there from the start, Gtk is clearly not an absolute requirement. What I’m arguing now is that it’s the values which are important, and the toolkit is only a means to that end. We should evaluate apps on the basis of how well they meet the requirement, not prejudice them on the basis of technical choices made by the developer.\nIn evaluating an app for the Ubuntu default install, we should ask:\n\n*\n\n*is it free software?\n\n*is it best-in-class?\n\n*does it integrate with the system settings and preferences?\n\n*does it integrate with other applications?\n\n*is it accessible to people who cannot use a mouse, or keyboard?\n\n*does it look and feel consistent with the rest of the system?\n\nOf course, the developer’s choice of Qt has no influence on the first two. Qt itself has been available under the GPL for a long time, and more recently became available under the LGPL. And there’s plenty of best-in-class software written with Qt, it’s a very capable toolkit.\nSystem settings and prefs, however, have long been a cause of friction between Qt and Gtk. Integration with system settings and preferences is critical to the sense of an application “belonging” on the system. It affects the ability to manage that application using the same tools one uses to manage all the other applications, and the sorts of settings-and-preference experience that users can have with the app. This has traditionally been a problem with Qt / KDE applications on Ubuntu, because Gtk apps all use a centrally-manageable preferences store, and KDE apps do things differently.\nTo address this, Canonical is driving the development of dconf bindings for Qt, so that it is possible to write a Qt app that uses the same settings framework as everything else in Ubuntu. We’ve contracted with Ryan Lortie, who obviously knows dconf very well, and he’ll work with some folks at Canonical who have been using Qt for custom development work for customers. We’re confident the result will be natural for Qt developers, and a complete expression of dconf’s semantics and style.\nThe Qt team have long worked well in the broader Ubuntu community – we have great Qt representation at UDS every six months, the Kubuntu team have deep experience and interest in Qt packaging and maintenance, there is lots of good technical exchange between Qt upstream and various parts of the Ubuntu community, including Canonical. For example, Qt folks are working to integrate uTouch.\nI’d draw a distinction between “Qt” and “KDE” in the obvious places. A KDE app doesn’t know anything about the dconf system configuration, and can’t easily integrate with the Ubuntu desktop as a result. So we’re not going to be proposing Amarok to replace Banshee any time soon! But I think it’s entirely plausible that dconf, once it has great Qt bindings, be considered by the KDE community. There are better people to lead that conversation if they want, so I’ll not push the idea further here  . Nevertheless, should a KDE app learn to talk dconf in addition to the standard KDE mechanisms, which should be straightforward, it would be a candidate for the Ubuntu default install.\nThe decision to be open to Qt is in no way a criticism of GNOME. It’s a celebration of free software’s diversity and complexity. Those values of ease of use and integration remain shared values with GNOME, and a great basis for collaboration with GNOME developers and project members. Perhaps GNOME itself will embrace Qt, perhaps not, but if it does then our willingness to blaze this trail would be a contribution in leadership. It’s much easier to make a vibrant ecosystem if you accept a certain amount of divergence from the canonical way, so to speak  Our work on design is centered around GNOME, with settings and preferences the current focus as we move to GNOME 3.0 and gtk3.\nOf course, this is a perfect opportunity for those who would poke fun at that relationship to do so, but in my view what matters most is the solid relationship we have with people who actually write applications under the GNOME banner. We want to be the very best way to make the hard work of those free software developers matter, by which we mean, the best way to ensure it makes a real difference in millions of lives every day, and the best way to connect them to their users.\nTo the good folks at Trolltech, now Nokia, who have made Qt a great toolkit – thank you. To developers who wish to use it and be part of the Ubuntu experience – welcome.\n\n\nA: My take on the Technical/pragmatic reasons:  Nokia purchased Trolltech and invested a lot into QT.  Its lightweight and has years of optimization toward mobile platform.  Regardless of your current opinions of Nokia, the N900 was years ahead of its time ... and it was debian / QT based... but pricey. However, I have no real knowledge of the decisions.\n\nA: Ubuntu CTO Matt Zimmerman's blog is also informative:\n\nIt is in this spirit that I have been thinking about Qt recently. We\n  want to make it fast, easy and painless to develop applications for\n  Ubuntu, and Qt is an option worth exploring for application\n  developers. In thinking about this, I’ve realized that there is quite\n  a bit of commonality between the strengths of Qt and some of the new\n  directions in Ubuntu:\n  \n  \n*\n  \n*Qt has a long history of use on ARM as well as x86, by virtue of being popular on embedded devices. Consumer products have been built\n  using Qt on ARM for over 10 years. We’ve been making Ubuntu products\n  available for ARM for nearly two years now, and 10.10 supports more\n  ARM boards than ever, including reference boards from Freescale,\n  Marvell and TI. Qt is adding ARMv7 optimizations to benefit the latest\n  ARM chips. We do this in order to offer OEMs a choice of hardware,\n  without sacrificing software choice. Qt preserves this same choice for\n  application developers.\n  \n*Qt is a cross-platform application framework, with official ports for Windows, MacOS and more, and experimental community ports to\n  Android, the iPhone and WebOS. Strong cross-platform support was one\n  of the original principles of Qt, and it shows in the maturity of the\n  official ports. With Ubuntu Light being installed on computers with\n  Windows, and Ubuntu One landing on Android and the iPhone, we need\n  interoperability with other platforms. There is also a large\n  population of developers who already know how to target Windows, who\n  can reach Ubuntu users as well by choosing Qt.\n  \n*Qt has a fairly mature touch input system, which now has support for multi-touch and gestures (including QML), though it’s only\n  complete on Windows 7 and Mac OS X 10.6. Meanwhile, Canonical has been\n  working with the community to develop a low-level multi-touch\n  framework for Linux and X11, for the benefit of Qt and other toolkits.\n  These efforts will eventually meet in the middle.\n  \n  \n  Overall, I think Qt has a lot to offer people who want to develop\n  applications for (and on) Ubuntu, particularly now. It already powers\n  popular cross-platform applications like VLC, not to mention the\n  entire Kubuntu distribution. I missed it when this happened last year,\n  but Qt is now available under either the LGPL 2.1 or the GPL 3.0,\n  which should make it suitable for virtually any Ubuntu application. It\n  has strong commercial backing as well as a large developer community.\n  No single solution will meet all developers’ needs, of course, and\n  Ubuntu supports multiple toolkits and frameworks for this reason, but\n  Qt seems like a great tool to have in our toolbox for the road ahead.\n\nAn Ars Technica article discussing this blog post provides some insights:\n\nQt can bring third-party developers to Linux\nAlthough Gtk+ still has value and there are a number of reasons to\n  continue using it for building native Linux software, Qt is now the\n  obvious choice for ISVs that are targeting multiple platforms. Qt\n  makes it exceptionally easy to conform to the native look and feel of\n  the underlying platform or build a totally custom user interface that\n  is optimally suited to a target device or form factor.\nAs Nokia and Intel bring MeeGo to a wide range of devices, it's going\n  to attract some major commercial software vendors. It would be\n  relatively easy for those software companies to bring their mobile Qt\n  applications to the Linux desktop using the same code that they use on\n  MeeGo. Qt is specifically designed to make that easy. This would be a\n  huge win for desktop Linux because it would bring third-party\n  applications that would not otherwise be available.\nIt's worth noting that some prominent mobile software vendors are\n  already eagerly embracing Qt due to Nokia's support for the toolkit.\n  Mobile video streaming company Qik, for example, is working on an\n  experimental Qt-based port of its popular application with the aim of\n  bringing it to MeeGo.\n\nThe author of the article is the creator of the Gwibber IM app, so he has some experience developing GUIs for Linux.\n\nA: GTK+ does not support resolution independence, Modern mobile devices have ultra high pixel densities. If you run a GTK+ application on a mobile screen all the user interface elements would be so small as to be unusable.\nThis has been an open bug on GTK+ since 2008 till it was closed in 2014 with \"we have hi-dpi scale support now - it is not quite the same thing, but close enough to render this bug obsolete\" comment. \nWhen GTK+3 was released, the project had the perfect opportunity to add resolution independence, because they were breaking compatibility anyway. They chose not to, and now it is really too late for them.\nOn the GTK+ Roadmap, resolution independence is planned for the release after 4.0, so they will release 4.0 then the major release after that will have it. If they stick to that plan then even desktop GNU/Linux will have to abandon GTK+ because high DPI desktop monitors and laptop monitors are available already and are about to become the new normal.\n", "Q: Install Ubuntu 12.04 alongside Windows 8 (not preinstalled) without grub I want to install x64 Ubuntu 12.04.2 on my HP laptop.

I'd suggest the easiest way is to start over, and do a manual installation / partition setup when asked for where to install.\nIn short, I'd suggest adding at least one partition on each disk... the simplest in this scenario would be one partition (likely ext4) on your SSD mounted as \"root\".  Another partition (likely also ext4), on your large disk mounted as \"home.\"\nDepending on the amount of memory you have, you may or may not want to setup a third partition as a swap partition.  In newer versions of linux kernel, swap can be a file; as such you don't need a partition -- and after install -- you can then experiment with adding a swap file to either root, or home partition.  If you have a lot of RAM, I'd also suggest modifying 'swapiness' for your system to be lower than default install. \nAs far as performance, it might even make sense to have your \"home\" partition also be on your SSD.  and then have your Documents, Pictures, Media, etc. folders mounted on your larger drive.  This is more complex setup, but the config files stored in ~/.local ~/.mozilla ~/.config -- etc -- will benefit by being on an SSD when loading programs.\nLots of choices.  And nothing that can't be changed in the future if you're unsure... in which case, start easy.\n\nA: \nHow can I improve my installation? \n\nMy method is to keep the partitions small and separated based on content.\n\n\n*\n\n*/ 15 Gb\n\n*swap 5Gb max; base it on RAM.\n\n*/home/ 15 Gb.\n\n*/personal/ the remainder.\n\n\nWhen I re-install Ubuntu I format 1 and 2 and have a clean install. If I need to keep my personal settings I only format 1. The personal disc I can use in several other operating systems and also includes my MySQL database files. I symlink my home folders to this disc. I have 3 users on my system all pointing to /personal/.\n\nIf you want to incorparate the SSD into it I would put root (/) on that disc and the other partition on the HDD. This makes for a very fast boot. Trim the SSD and put tmp in its own filessystem. More tips relating to SSD here.\n\nA: Can you be more clear about your problem, As far as I could understand, one of your problems is default boot entry in the boot menu. You can change it by editing grub. But as the same time I see it unrelated to the partitioning of you disk.\nYou can also change the grub default boot entry from the command line without having to install any additional tool. This won't change the order in the list but it will allow a different OS to boot by default, which sounds like what you may want anyway.\nFirst, make a backup copy of /etc/default/grub. In case something goes wrong, you can easily revert to the known-good copy.\n sudo cp /etc/default/grub /etc/default/grub.bak \nThen edit the file using vim or the text editor of your choice.\n sudo vim /etc/default/grub \nFind the line that contains GRUB_DEFAULT=0 and set it to GRUB_DEFAULT=x where x is the index of grub menu item to which you would like to boot to by default. Note that the menu items are zero-indexed. That means that the first item in the list is 0 and that the sixth item is actually 5. So to boot to the sixth item in the list, the line would read GRUB_DEFAULT=5.\nAdditionally, if you want to use a kernel in the \"Previous Linux Versions\" menu, you'll want to change GRUB_DEFAULT=0 to GRUB_DEFAULT=\"2>x\" (make sure to include the quotations), where x is the placement of the old kernel on the sub-list (assuming the \"Previous Linux Versions\" is third on the main list). Remember that the list always begins counting at 0.\nThen build the updated grub menu.\n sudo update-grub \n", "Q: can i install ubuntu in my trial version of windows 7?

It's only meant to be used to try-out Ubuntu or to rescue a damaged system.  Executing a sudo update-grub only works on an installed version of Ubuntu, where you have write access to the underlying GRUB files (and on a Live CD, you do not).\n\nA: Phase 1 - Note: don't use a Live CD.\n\n*\n\n*In your Ubuntu open a terminal (press Ctrl+Alt+T at the same time)\n\n*Type  gedit admin:///etc/default/grub This will run text-editor gedit, if you're using another one just type the name of it instead of gedit.\n\n*Make the changes you would like to make and save them.\n\n*Close gedit.Your terminal should still be open.\n\n*In the terminal type sudo update-grub, wait for the update to finish.\n\n*Reboot your computer.\n\nPhase 2 - After you have logged into your system\n\n*\n\n*Open a terminal again (Ctrl+Alt+T).\n\n*Type in the terminal gksu gedit /etc/default/grub\n\n*To see the grub-menu at boot time,comment or remove the following line: GRUB_HIDDEN_TIMEOUT=0\n\n*\n\n*To comment, add # at the beginning of this line, the result will be #GRUB_HIDDEN_TIMEOUT=0\n\n\n\n*Save the file.\n\n*Again in the terminal run sudo update-grub.\n\n\nIf seeing the grub menu at boot is the only thing you want you should undo earlier changes to the file.\n\nA: You can do update-grub from a live CD on an installed Ubuntu Distro (although I assume this works with any [debian-based?] linux distro.  It is \"required\" (there may be other methods but knowing this one, I don't care about them at all) if you clone your drive and have already installed the new one in the computer.  I mention cloning here extensively, because in a sense the update-grub step is a subset of it and the approaches have the same basis during a live session.  Also this method was discovered through searching in the context of cloning.  You can take what you need from it if you are not cloning, and your process will be simplified.\nI should qualify this here; importantly for cloning, not importantly for just doing update-grub:  I have done this on BIOS systems only.  I have not attempted it on a UEFI system.  The UEFI system requires a FAT partition for boot loading and I have not tested whether this partition should just come along for the ride during the cloning copy steps.  I expect that it does affect the required [bind-]mounting that synthesizes the native grub environment during the live session...\nThis is detailed on this page: http://frugaltech.happystoic.com/ssdlinux.  I have used this method many times, and you can swap hard drives around ad-infinitum using it.  Swapping physical hard drives becomes so trivial this way, it is tempting to make it its own hobby and/or try to fix other people's messed-up computers.\nThe following may be a helpful paraphrase of what you will find there:\n\n\n*\n\n*Ctrl+Alt+T for Bash terminal and enter a superuser shell (sudo -s) during a live session.\n\n*mount the full install drive partition (that which is [or will become] your permanent Linux filesystem root directory).\n2a. If the full install already exists on your hard drive, skip to (2).  IF you are CLONING: [based on the assumption that you are not doing a fresh install, since this is all entirely automatic in that case] if your full install does not already exist on this partition, now is the time to simply  \nrsync -a /existing/linux/filesystem/live-mount-point/ /new/linux/filesystem/live-mount-point/ \n\n[these mount points are purely with respect to the live session environment - in Ubuntu they are generally of the form \"/media/ubuntu/???\"] it onto the new drive [partition].\n2b. Other operating system full installs can be handled in the same way here.  I have generally used a Windows-based resource to bulk-copy windows partitions to new drives in advance but I have also used rsync and it worked for Win XP (assuming you have support for the correct partition format, such as ntfs; I think the live session media do generally come inclusive of alternative format support).  Just be careful about your spelling and use the trailing  / in the source directory if you are fully naming the target.\n\n*bind-mount the live /dev, /proc, and /sys directories to their respective directories on your [mounted] permanent full install partition you are seeking to use.  The script detailed in the link above accomplishes this very elegantly with a \"for\" statement.  Also, the script given does not need to be executed as a script, per se.  It can be entered from the bash prompt, line-by-line.\n\n*chroot to the permanent full install partition.  After doing (3) and (4), the system now \"virtually resides\" in your \"final filesystem\" and GRUB will function homogeneously.  Without these steps, grub will assume your system is simply a live session, and I don't know specifically what it does in that case but sufficiently it is not the desired outcome, as to which was alluded above in this thread.\n\n*run grub-install on the /dev/sdX (drive, not mount point) that corresponds with the permanent install (or whichever drive will host GRUB if a multi-drive [, multi-boot] system).  Flexibility here may depend on your vintage and BIOS.  As far as I know running \"grub-install\" does nothing harmful if it not necessary, so I always do it if I am using this live session method.\n\n*run update-grub and it will act as if the running system is nested in the future permanent partition, discovering all kernels and bootable OSes you may have available.\n\n*If you have not physically changed hard drives, skip to (5). Otherwise edit or verify your  /new/linux/filesystem/live-mount-point/etc/fstab file to ensure correct file system structure for your [new] environment.  If you are at this level you surely already know about using  blkid  to harvest UUIDs for fstab.  \nIMHO: you should always use UUIDs in fstab (not \"dev/sdXY\" form) since in its own scope it is immune to physical hard drive reconfiguration, other than the degree to which this requires literal updates of UUID values (such as if at some point in the future you install an additional HDD for your /home directory, etc.).  It is simply the most fundamental, robust, and invariant approach.\n\n*exit the chroot, exit supershell, exit bash, shut down, and start the system without the live media.  You should now be where you intended.\nImportantly NOTE: Arguments for  mount  and  chroot are directories (generally, MOUNT POINTS such as /mnt/?? or /media/??) corresponding to the live session.  In most if not all cases a full install resides in its own partition, so the terms \"directory\" and \"mount point\" are essentially synonymous here.  Argument for grub-install is a PHYSICAL DRIVE (generally /dev/sdX, where \"X\" is a letter corresponding to the drive in your system, sda, sdb, etc. and it should not depend on the session).\nYou should now be done.  I have simultaneously cloned Windows (XP and 7) in various permutations alongside Ubuntu and Puppy using this method and it has not failed me.  I think you can use a live medium of a different distro (I have only used different Ubuntu flavors and Mint for this however) as long as they provide the version of GRUB you intend to use.  You can move partitions around, swap drives, combine other OS installs, and clone to or from SSD using this.  I can only speak to it working in the same machine however.  I assume drivers that might be required for a different machine might have been skipped during your previous full install.  My rule of thumb is switching drives in a computer requires this method, but switching computers with a drive requires a full [re-]install.  \nPerhaps someone can debunk this..?\n", "Q: When will chrome support WebGL on Linux?

I have a Windows 7 machine I upgraded to Windows 8, so as a result I have BIOS and not UEFI. I attempted to install Ubuntu 12.10 alongside Windows 8 yesterday, and accidentally used wubi without understanding it had massive errors. \nAfter completely formatting my hard drive and re-installing Windows 8, I want to attempt installing Ubuntu 12.10 again. I made the bootable USB again, but when I went to install Ubuntu, I didn't get the option to install Ubuntu alongside Windows 8. As a result, I have tried making a bootable USB for Ubuntu 13.10, Ubuntu 12.04 LTS, and even Ubuntu 11.10 but none of them gave me the option of installing Ubuntu alongside Windows 8.\nIn order to rectify this issue, I figured I must partition my drive myself and continue with the 'something else' installing option of Ubuntu 12.10. Would it be better to partition my drive in Windows or the bootable Ubuntu USB? Second, is the fact that Windows 8 isn't recognised by Ubuntu indicative of some errors with the hard drive or my computer that I should fix before I attempt to do something manually? \n\nA: Fact that you had Windows 7 preinstalled doesn't mean that you don't have UEFI. You probably have the UEFI boot disabled by default.\nTo install Ubuntu alongside Windows manually you have to have 2 partitions\n/ - root partition (your system partition)\nswap - swap if you are planning on putting your computer into sleep mode (generally swap = amount of RAM you have + a bit more) \nOr you can have 3 partitions \nThe same two as described above and \n/Home partition - where all your data being saved. If you do not create this partition that Root partition will be used as a Home as well. generally it means that if you will reinstall the OS you won't have a possible to save partition with the data.\nThen when you decide how you are going to partition your drive you want to select where to install grub. Commonly it goes to\n\n/dev/sda\n\nSo if you have that already selected, don't touch it, either wise change it. \nAnd that's it, you can click Install button. Ignore the message about missing boot partition. I have been installing OS without it all the same and it runs perfectly fine.\nAfter that you follow basic GUI installation process. \n\nA: Windows 8 may be hibernated, as it normally has hibernation always on. You need to turn the fastboot setting off. Then Ubuntu should see the Windows partition. May be better to shrink Windows with Windows disk tools and reboot so it can run its chkdsk and make its repairs to recognize its new size.\nIt defaults shutdown to a hybrid hibernation/off state for fast boot \nhttp://www.kapilarya.com/how-to-enable-disable-fast-start-up-in-windows-8\nFast Startup off/hibernation\nhttp://www.eightforums.com/tutorials/6320-fast-startup-turn-off-windows-8-a.html\n\nA: If you need to resize your Windows partition to make room for Ubuntu, it's best to do it from Windows's own Disk Management tool. Then, shutdown completely from Windows 8 and boot from your Ubuntu USB.\nChoose Something Else, then make 2 partitions. 1 will be 4 gigabytes, though the size isn't too important. This should be used as swap. Use the other partition as ext4, and let it fill the empty space. Mount it at /\nThat should be all you need.\n", "Q: can I run a python script in ubuntu 12.04's from the graphical interface I'm trying to figure out how to select and run a python file through the ubuntu windows system. I've never run scripts in my life and I'm very new to this.. So I went to youtube cause I felt like this shouldn't have been hard but... \nUsing the script (and instructions) described here:  Create, Save and Run Python Program via Ubuntu Terminal \nprint\"hello world\"\nvary = raw_input(\"Enter your Name\")\nprint (\"hey\" + vary)\n\nI tried to open the the file by double clicking it (again and again)... and it failed, would not ask for my input, just opened the terminal and disappeared (closed the shell) and that's all.. but IDLE was able to run it perfectly so I know it's not the script. When I used VIM to create it as a file and run it from there, I got this output: \nTraceback (most recent call last):\n  File \"shiite/livescript/rev.py\", line 2, in <module>\n    vary = input(\"Enter your Name Bitch:  \")\n  File \"<string>\", line 1, in <module>\nNameError: name 'Dave' is not defined\n\nOne more thing, I've also tried selecting the properties of the file with right click and checked the box that let's it execute.. still nothing.. \nAnyone know why the Ubuntu terminal won't run python programs??? Maybe there's a terminal that will run something like this??? \n\nA: In Windows, the file types are identified by the last 3 chars after the . However, in linux (and in Ubuntu) .py just helps us humans figure out what kind of file it is. You have to tell Ubuntu that the script you wrote is a python script and it should be run with a python interpreter. You can do this in two ways:\nFirst you can call python followed by the name of the script. That is open a terminal and type:\npython hellowworld.py\n\nThis will work. \nSecond, however, you want to use the GUI and run it by double clicking. To this you need a line in the script that tells Ubuntu that the next lines are to be interpreted as a python script. This first line is called the shabang line. For python it looks like:\n#! /usr/bin/python\n\nNote the #! at the beginning. The first two characters of your script must be those two followed by the rest of the line. So your script will look like:\n#! /usr/bin/python\n\nprint\"hello world\"\nvary = raw_input(\"Enter your Name\")\nprint (\"hey \" + vary)\n\nAs you noted the script must be tagged as executable. To do that, right click on the script's icon and go to Properties>Permissions and check Allow executing file as program.\nNow when you double click on the script it will show you a Window with the choices:\nRun in terminal, Display, Cancel, Run\nYou can try Run in terminal. It will open a terminal and show you the prompt:\nEnter your name\n\nWhen you enter your name the terminal will close as the script completes. So you will never see \"hey [your name]\" as it will happen too fast for your eyes to catch it. You will have to modify the script so that it pauses and wait for you to dismiss it after you see the display.\nHope this helps\n\nA: To recreate your issue, I first verified that I had Python installed on my system.\nxaap001@ubuntu:~$ which python\n/usr/bin/python\nxaap001@ubuntu:~$ python\nPython 2.7.3 (default, Aug  1 2012, 05:14:39) \n[GCC 4.6.3] on linux2\nType \"help\", \"copyright\", \"credits\" or \"license\" for more information.\n>>> exit()\n\nI then took the Python \"hello world\" code you posted above and saved it to a file called helloWorld.py.  I did not alter the permissions on this file after saving it.  From terminal, I tried the following:\nxaap001@ubuntu:~$ python helloWorld.py\nhello world\nEnter your NameAaron\nheyAaron\n\nLooks like it worked.  From terminal, you just need to preface all Python scripts with python.\nEdit: I decided to try and get this to work from the desktop, by creating a desktop shortcut as described in this question/answer: Desktop shortcut to create a new desktop shortcut doesn't do anything\nI set the \"command\" to: python /home/xaap001/helloWorld.py\nThat gave me a desktop icon I could click on.  And it did nothing.  I checked the actual content of the .desktop file (shortcut):\n[Desktop Entry]\nVersion=1.0\nType=Application\nTerminal=false\nIcon[en_US]=python\nName[en_US]=Python helloWorld\nExec=python /home/xaap001/helloWorld.py\nName=helloWorldPy\nIcon=python\n\nI noticed the Terminal=false setting, and changed it to Terminal=true.  Then double-clicking on the icon worked.\n\nA: can U believe that? I have to admit, I think my ubuntu has a virus or something.. but yes, I did that and this:\nlucky1@babyCatsDesktop:~/shiite/livescript$ python rev.py\nHello WOrld\nEnter your Name Please:  Dave\nTraceback (most recent call last):\nFile \"rev.py\", line 2, in \nvary = input(\"Enter your Name Please:  \")\n\nFile \"\", line 1, in \nNameError: name 'Dave' is not defined\nlucky1@babyCatsDesktop:~/shiite/livescript$\nYet it works on the python terminal perfectly? I'm not good at this stuff and I seem to find the most unique, yet common problems out there.. \n\nA: In Python 2 (which you are probably using) input() and raw_input() aren't the same. Your script uses input(), unlike the example.\ninput() takes your input and tries to evaluate it. Because there is no object called \"Dave\" in your namespace, Python doesn't know what to do. raw_input() however converts your input to a string, this should be used in almost all of the cases.\nNote: In Python 3, raw_input() has been renamed to input().\nYou think nothing happens because an error is thrown and the script terminates. This is also the reason why you should always run scripts from the terminal, so you can see error messages or general debugging information which is printed.\nSo, change your script to use raw_input() and run it from the terminal until you got all the bugs out, then try double-clicking it.\n", "Q: Ubuntu 12.10 will not shutdown/reboot.

I just set up my Ubuntu desktop to use our living room TV as a monitor, and I would like to be able to use either my iPhone or Nexus 7 tablet as a mousepad/keyboard for controlling it from the couch. With Mac/Windows there were plenty of apps that did this, what do I need to do this using Ubuntu? And just to be clear I am NOT looking for a Remote Desktop on my phone/tablet, I want to use them as a mouse and keyboard. Thanks!\n\nA: I use remotedroid. You just need to install the client on your tablet, and then connect to the local IP of your running server. It sends mouse movements, left and right click and typing.\nThe server doesn't even need installation, is a simple .jar archive. To run it:\njava -jar /path/to/RemoteDroidServer.jar\n\nHere you can download the server (the client is in the market):\nhttp://www.remotedroid.net/\n\nA: There is another option that I use which is GSConnect extension (Basically KDE Connect with better stablity on gnome). It has a lot of other features also as a bonus. You need KDE Connect on your android mobile / tablet also.\n\nA: There is an option for iPhone which acts as a trackpad and/or keyboard over Wifi. It is called TouchPad, by Edovia (the same people who made Screens). It works on iPhone and iPad, and while it was designed primarily for Mac, I have confirmed that it works on Ubuntu  with only a VNC server (no special server daemon required). It costs AU$5.49 currently.\n\nA: Another option to the remote control like apps mentioned above, you can connect your phone via connectbot, depending on your phone and distribution flavor there are a vriety of tutorials out there, or more general like this one http://tech.shantanugoel.com/2010/08/02/ssh-tunneling-android.html .  \nI like this option because I use a droid 2 and it gives me greater functional control over my desktop system that I too have set up with the living room TV. I like not leaving the couch to type anymore. :) Cheers \n\nA: If the desktop PC has bluetooth connectivity, you can try to emulate a bluetooth mouse and or keyboard with your phone or tablet. This use the bluetooth HID (Human Interface Device), which is a standard bluetooth protocol: any computer having bluez installed (included in default install) is ready !\nSo, the main issue here is to find an application that runs on your phone or tablet that emulate a bluetooth HID. There is a question about that. On my android phone, I tried BlueputDroid which is free of charge (but has adds). Any pointer to a better app would be welcomed. It require root through, because of restriction in the android API...\nSo, after you launched the bluetooth HID emulation app on your phone/tablet, you just have to associate (or re-associate) it with your computer. I had to log-out for it to work, but after that any click / mouse movement / keyboard event from your phone go to your desktop PC.\n\nA: AnyRemote\nIt provide remote control service on Linux through Bluetooth, Wi-Fi or just TCP/IP connection.  \nanyRemote can be used by:\nbluetooth connection with Android or J2ME (if cell phone is JSR82 compatible) clients \nWi-Fi connection with Android or J2ME clients if phone supports Wi-Fi\nIR connection with J2ME client if java realization in phone supports access to IR port\nordinary TCP/IP connection with Android or J2ME clients, if PC is connectable from internet\nbluetooth, infrared or cable connection using AT \"modem\" commands\nWeb interface\nit has limited support for Bemused clients\nexperimental support for iPhone/iPod Touch with Command Fu  sion's iViewer installed  \nAndroid devices\nNokia Series40 and Series60\nSony Ericsson\nMotorola\nSite: http://anyremote.sourceforge.net/\n\nA: Now you can try the remote-touchpad, a web service for control of mouse and keyboard from external touchpad devices, without need to install a separate client to connect.

I've recently upgraded to Ubuntu 12.04 and so far I didn't have problems with it. Until I decided to make a stupid mistake of messing with the Compiz settings and making the GUI disappear. I made some research and I managed to get it working again, but I felt like it was still partially broken, and Unity became slower than before.\nI didn't bother with this anymore, found out the Compiz/GTK/Unity settings are separated for each user, so I logged in as guest, deleted my main account and created a new one.\nThere's one problem though. When I created the new administrator account, it didn't ask me for a password, but when I tried to log in, it asks for a password and now I have no idea on how to set/change the password for this account, since I can only login as guest without superuser/root access.\nI use this PC for development, although I'm a total noob with Linux.

Here is the output of boot-repair: http://paste.ubuntu.com/5706404/\nThe GRUB keeps telling me this while I try to boot into Windows:\nerror: invalid efi path\n\nI can boot into Ubuntu without problems.\n\nA: First, which Windows entry are you trying to use? There are three in the grub.cfg file that you posted. The first two (Windows 7 (loader) (on /dev/sda3) and Windows Recovery Environment (loader) (on /dev/sda5)) won't work. The third (Windows 7 UEFI) is closer to working, but it sets the wrong --root option; it should read --root CF46-460C, not --root 0EEC3E6EEC3E5067. To fix this, you'll need to edit /etc/grub.d/40_custom and then run sudo update-grub.\nIf that doesn't work, you could try another boot manager, such as rEFInd, which tends to be less finicky about launching Windows. Booting to Ubuntu and then installing the rEFInd Debian package should set everything up to work, although you might then want to tweak a few settings, especially if you see duplicate entries in the menu. (Check the dont_scan_volumes, dont_scan_dirs, and dont_scan_files options in refind.conf.)\n\nEDIT: If selecting the Windows entry in rEFInd brings you to GRUB, then something (probably the Ubuntu Boot Repair tool) has copied GRUB over the Windows boot loader. With any luck, you should be able to find the original file under a backup filename and copy it back. From Ubuntu, the Windows boot loader (which has been replaced by GRUB) is /boot/efi/EFI/Microsoft/Boot/bootmgfw.efi. Look for this file, and look for a file with a similar name, like bkpbootmgfw.efi or bootmgfw.efi.grb. Copy the backup file over the bootmgfw.efi file (creating your own backup first, just to be on the safe side).\n", "Q: How to view twitter with empathy?

It depends on many factors that you didn't cover. How did you created the linux partitions, how did you install Install Ubuntu? From LiveDVD? From LiveUSB? Manual or automatic? Does your PC have a BIOS or a UEFI? Is your partition table an MBR or GPT? Etc. I know all these questions scare you. It did to me too, a long time ago when i started learning linux.  \nFirst, Windows will never recognize ANY other operating system. That's the Microsoft way. Or any other partition types except their own. Windows, bootloader (winboot) will never recognize any other bootloader. \nSecondly, Ubuntu (as well as other linuxes) will always recognize other operating systems like Windows and MacOS. Ubuntu's bootloader (GRUB or GRUB2)     will always recognize winboot.  \nEvery operating system needs a bootloader - a small software that tells the PC hardware the identity of the operating system, how it works and how to load it into RAM memory. An installed operating system without a bootloader is useless, because it will never be recognized by the hardware.\nWhat happens when we install multiple OSes (each one with its' own bootloader) on the same PC? Well, one bootloader must rule them all. A single GRUB is sufficient for multiple linuxes. For a Windows + a linux PC, a winboot must be present and a GRUB too. Preferably on different partitions (because if one fails, at least you'll have the other still available). But the GRUB must be the ruler, because it recognizes any other bootloader, and winboot does not.\nHow to make GRUB rule the world? First install Windows. Automatically. Don't erase/merge any partitions. Secondly install Ubuntu. During Ubuntu install process, it should recognize the Windows installation. Choose install Ubuntu along Windows option. When asking you where to install GRUB choose /sda. That means the root of your first hard-disk. Highest priority possible! Don't choose any /sda1, /sda2, etc, because that means installing GRUB in the root of the specified partition 1, 2 ,etc and may result in conflict with winboot, erase winboot or not superseding winboot. \nOne last thing: Although it is sometimes possible to install Ubuntu to NTFS or FAT partitions, that is only advisable to advanced and expert linux users. Any typical linux (Ubuntu included) needs AT LEAST 2 partitions: a swap partition and an ext2/3/4 partition.The swap partition is always inaccessible, it acts as virtual RAM memory, the ext partition is where your Ubuntu will be installed. For adequate usage SWAP size should be = (1.5...2) x RAM size. EXT partition can be any size you want, but no less than minimum size recommended by Ubuntu.\nTip: The Windows' Disk Management equivalent in Linux is called GParted. And you can use it before (as in liveCD) and after you install Ubuntu.\nFor proper viewing of ALL partitions on your disk ALWAYS use GParted!! A had an unpleasant surprise with Win8: it automatically creates a recovery partition upon install that is not visible in Disk Management, but is recognised by GParted!\n\nA: To my knowledge you cannot install Ubuntu on an NTFS partition. This is likely what caused the problem. Deleting the Ubuntu partition visible in Disk Management and reinstalling Ubuntu might fix it. You should leave the space as free space inside windows, then create an ext4 partition from within the Ubuntu installer. Or choosing install alongside Windows should also work.\n\nA: The real problem is likely the UEFI system. Boot with ubuntu live and use boot repair. look at https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Boot-Repair and use 2nd option.\nwhen it repairs system boot and after reboot, you should see the grub menu to choose between ubuntu and windows. then you may edit your partitions in your ubuntu with gparted or similar programs.\n\nA: I had same problem, \nHow did I solve it??\nI had 320GB hard drive in my hard disk only 4 partitions are possible. I already had 4parts so even after Ubuntu was successfully installed I couldn't start it that's because my hard disk has reached it's maximum capacity. So my suggestion is try deleting a partition then install ubuntu GRUB starts automatically\n", "Q: make slingshot-launcher run in fullscreen mode on Xubuntu Here's what I got cooking on Xubuntu 12.04\nSLINGSHOT LAUNCHER for precise\nelementary-daily ppa\nbut it runs in a mini mode on the upper left of the screen.

You might try reviewing your wine configuration to determine if your wine config recognises your hardware. It should, but it may not. An updated version of Wine may also help resolve the issue if you are following the Ubuntu Wine Team ppa you might note that many updates have occurred for Wine since the first 12.04 LTS release.\n\nA: I had the same problem.

I had installed Ubuntu 12.04 along side Windows 7.  I was planning on switching over so I figured I would copy over all my pictures, music, and other files to my new Ubuntu partition and then delete Windows.  I had figured Ubuntu created a separate partition on my hard drive which had nothing to do with Windows so I went ahead and deleted the Windows partitions. \nI didn't realize this would destroy my Ubuntu installation as well.  When I go to install Windows again with the disc I can see the partition that was created for Ubuntu, but all it shows is free space.

This was made on purpose by the designers. It is to show how minimization works.\nYou should see that the animation gets faster and faster with time. This is automatic.\n\nA: Could you be running out of RAM? I like to be a bit of a derp at times, so I once wrote a program that creates a large memory leak. I was monitoring the CPU usage and RAM usage of the system constantly. When the system starts swapping, it grinds to a halt. Even though I have an SSD, that doesn't give the speed of RAM.\nMy CPU usage was at like 10%, but the RAM usage was to the point where if the kernel derped up, a kernel panic would have been prevalent.\nWhen the kernel called SIGKILL on my application and terminated it, Unity became smooth again immediately.\nWhen I was having this freezing problem, it would take 30 seconds for me to switch windows.\nIf you have more than 4GB of RAM, you're good. 2GB and under can be quite unuseable because the latest versions of Ubuntu suck up RAM with all the features they come with out of the box.\nAnother possibility is that you may have a frail GPU. Unity uses a whole lot of OpenGL, so a good graphics card is a necessity. If this problem persists, try Lubuntu. If you keep getting this problem, you're computer's specs aren't good enough for Ubuntu.\nI myself have an i3, 6GB RAM, and HD 3000 GPU, so most of the latest computers have greater specs!\n", "Q: Printer does not print, queue showing completed, can not correct setup Using 12.04; I recently added a USB connection for Arduino board.

While keeping a 450 G partition for Mac OS X, I have created a main 150 G partition for Ubuntu, a 2G swap partition, and finally a small partition for bios-grub, since it didn't want to continue the installation if there were none. I remember having set the boot loader to the 150 G Ubuntu partition, but without really being sure of what I did.\nWhen I restart my computer, the rEFIt menu gives me the choice between OS X and Ubuntu, but when I choose Ubuntu the only thing I get is a black screen with a blinking cursor... At least I didn't ruin my OS X, but I have tried tho reinstall it the same way and I got exactly the same result. Do you know what I could have done wrong ? Thank you for your help.\n\nA: First, unless you've got a fairly elderly Mac with a 32-bit EFI, you're better off with a 64-bit version of Ubuntu. Although you can boot a 32-bit version of Linux on a 64-bit Mac, doing so restricts your boot loader options and may require you to jump through some extra hoops. This may be what you're running into, so scrapping your new installation in favor of a native 64-bit installation may be in order.\nSecond, my suspicion is that you're booting in BIOS mode but you lack a hybrid MBR. This is an ugly hack that Apple uses to, among other things, activate the BIOS emulation (aka CSM) in the Mac's firmware. You may be able to get the system booting by creating a hybrid MBR with gdisk (part of the package of the same name in Ubuntu, IIRC); see my first link for detailed instructions on doing this.\nThird, if you switch to a 64-bit version of Ubuntu, IMHO you're better off without a hybrid MBR. Instead, you should install an EFI-mode boot loader for Linux and boot with that. (Unfortunately, it's easier to install Ubuntu in BIOS mode, so you'll need to do this after installing Ubuntu.) Macs are a bit weird, though. Your best bet may be to switch from rEFIt (which hasn't been updated in three years) to its more recent fork, rEFInd. rEFInd can launch a Linux 3.3.0 or later kernel directly, without involving GRUB. This is most easily done if you install an EFI filesystem driver for whatever filesystem you use on Linux's /boot partition (or the root partition if you don't use a separate /boot) and create a /boot/refind_linux.conf file. This is all described in the rEFInd documentation.\n", "Q: Unable to connect to 127.0.0.1:9050: Err http://extras.ubuntu.com quantal Release.gpg I have Ubuntu 12.10 installed, since about 1 month ago i can't install any program from software center, or synaptic or terminal, and also i can not update my installed software.

For example, I want to rename tif/fat/tul/codes/MyCode.pl to TheCode.pl in the same directory. Currently I know I can use this: \nmv tif/fat/tul/codes/MyCode.pl tif/fat/tul/codes/TheCode.pl\n\nbut that requires me to repeat typing the full path (can be annoying if the path is quite long)\nor I can use \ncd mv tif/fat/tul/codes/\nmv MyCode.pl TheCode.pl\n\nThe drawback being I have to type 2 commands, and have to change the current directory is undesirable in many cases.\nIs there a more efficient way to do this?\n\nA: Another thing you can do is open another shell (like bash) in your current one, cd to the directory of the file, and then mv.\nThen you just close the shell with Ctrl+D (which moves back to your previous directory).\n\nA: find /path/to/dir/ -iname MyCode.pl -execdir mv MyCode.pl TheCode.pl\n\n/path/to/dir is path of directory in which you want to rename files.\nNote: This will rename all files in directory /path/to/dir/ and its subdirectory.\n", "Q: Creating a .desktop file for a new application I just installed the lastest version of UGENE.

I've googled extensively but haven't found how to add a password option so I don't have to type it in manually. I've created the following alias:\nalias int='sudo service network-manager restart'\n\nBut I don't want to type in my password every time, is there some command I can pass to the alias with my password?\n\nA: Echoing the password into the command works but should only be exercised in extreme cases where there's absolutely no security concerns.\nHowever, I believe a better solution would be to make a new rule in /etc/sudoers to allow certain commands (sudo service network-manager restart in this case) to be executed without password. See the answer to this question to understand how to do it.\n\nA: This is what I use:\nalias nm='echo \"abcdefg\" | sudo -S service network-manager restart'\n\nwhere \"abcdefg\" stands for my actual password. I'm the sole user of my computer and no one else has access to it. So I'm not too concerned about security.\nFrom the sudo man page:\n\nThe -S (stdin) option causes sudo to read the password from standard\n  input instead of the terminal device.  The password must be followed\n  by a newline character.\n\n", "Q: How to prevent installation of Ruby Version Manager on 12.04 Server from failing? (works on Desktop) Here is some weird error I'm experiencing trying to install Ruby version manager on a server running Ubuntu 12.04: the problem is that when I make some test on my pc, which is Running 12.04 \"regular edition\" following the official guide (https://rvm.io/rvm/install/) it works smoothly.\nBut whenever I try to follow the guide to install RVM on a server running Ubuntu 12.04 \"Server edition\" RVM remains \"unsourced\" and it is not recognized as a command, even if I manually source the script, it doesn't matter.\nI've been fighting with this for almost two days. But the only mention I found to a similar error seems to be related to an already-patched bug on RVM that seemingly shouldn't be bothering anyone at all at the time of posting this question.\n(rvm: command not found - RVM MultiUser install on Ubuntu 12.04 server on StackOverFlow).\nOther guides that promise to get Ruby (and RVM) up and running on your 12.04 machine also fail with this server.\nI'm running the amd64 version and the server instance is fresh and has nothing else but git installed.\n\nA: The problem resides on the creation of the user on the server side. The user was created using the terminal and no parameters were used on the creation.\nAs the thing goes, it leaves the new user using the \"sh\" shell from POSIX, that is not supported by Ruby Version Manager. Changing the shell to bash solve the issue.\nYou can do this for an already-created user running this (if you are logged in as the user you want to change the shell to):\nsudo chsh -s $( which bash ) $USER\n\nOr you can run this and change the bash for any user:\nusermod -s /bin/bash user \n\n** Thanks mpapis, developer of RVM, for the debugging :)\n", "Q: Grub EFI entries and Boot-Repair I installed Ubuntu 12.10 on a Dell laptop with OEM Windows 8 on it.\nAt first, my Grub menu didn't show at all, so I changed the /etc/default/grub file commenting the line GRUB_HIDDEN_TIMEOUT=0.\nAfter that, my Grub menu appeared, but it showed only the Ubuntu entries (no trace of Windows 8 entries).\nSo I booted Ubuntu from LiveCD and followed this guide: Ubuntu Boot-Repair.\nAt the end a window appeared telling me this:\n\nPlease do not forget to make your BIOS boot on sda1/EFI/ubuntu/grubx64.efi file.\n\nWhich is something I didn't get how to manage. I went beyond this problem pretending indifference.\nNow I have my Grub menu working and I can boot Windows 8, but I'm wondering what are the different entries that I have in the menu. Here they are:\n\n  \n*\n  \n*Ubuntu\n  \n*Advanced options for Ubuntu\n  \n*Windows UEFI bkpbootmgfw.efi\n  \n*Windows boot UEFI loader\n  \n*EFI/Dell/Boot/bootmgfw.efi\n  \n*EFI/Dell/Boot/bootx64.efi\n  \n*System Setup\n  \n\nI don't know what these different entries mean, and I'd like to know if I can remove any of them from the GRUB menu.\nSo I rephrase my questions:\n\n\n*\n\n*How was I supposed to make my BIOS boot on sda1/EFI/ubuntu/grubx64.efi file?\n\n*What do all these entries mean? What are their differences?\n\n*Can I remove any of them? If so, how?\n\n\nA: *\n\n*How was I supposed to make my BIOS boot on sda1/EFI/ubuntu/grubx64.efi file?\n\n\n*\n\n*sudo grub-install --efi-directory=/boot/efi /dev/sda should be correct, given that:\n\n\n*\n\n*/dev/sda is the hard drive you installed Ubuntu on\n\n*/boot/efi is where your EFI System Partition (ESP) is mounted.\n\n*You booted in EFI mode.\n\n\nYou can quickly check this by looking at the output of the following command:\n$ mount | grep efi\nnone on /sys/firmware/efi/efivars type efivarfs (rw)\n/dev/sda1 on /boot/efi type vfat (rw)\n\n\n*How were you supposed to know this? It's not your fault. You should have been given proper instructions on how to properly install your operating system or troubleshoot your issue effectively. On the other side the highly praised freedom that Linux and FOSS can bring to you can only be achieved by learning how things work. Unfortunately, you would have to look into the log file that boot-repair creates and know what to do with this data.\ntl;dr: Some manpages are really useful. No, I'm not an RTFM type guy. I too like to get pointed to the specific paragraph, section or option that solves my problem before considering reading the entire page.\n\n\n*Try them all out to know what they are for. As Rod Smith already said, boot-repair creates duplicates (because it doesn't know what it's doing). Alternatively you could create and compare their hashes.\n\n*You could zip the files of the .efi programmes you don't want, then run sudo update-grub and verify that the menu still contains the entries necessary to boot Ubuntu and Windows (view the configuration file with nano /boot/grub/grub.cfg). If something is missing just unzip the files again. \nDo not confuse the GRUB menu with the UEFI boot menu.\n\n\n*\n\n*How do I remove \"Ubuntu\" in the bios boot menu? (UEFI)\n\nA: *\n\n*You use the efibootmgr command in Linux, the bcfg command in an EFI version 2 shell, the bless command in OS X (inapplicable on your Dell), or EFI-specific user interface features in some EFIs to set the default boot program. Type man efibootmgr to learn about the first of these.\n\n*Try the entries and see what each one does. Unfortunately, tools like Boot Repair tend to create duplicate entries, and some manufacturers create redundant or manufacturer-specific boot entries, so it's impossible to say what each of those entries really does except by testing them.\n\n*Tools like GRUB Customizer can help you edit your GRUB menus. I know very little about this tool, though, since I've abandoned GRUB.\n\n", "Q: When mounting a foreign filesystem how does Ubuntu match up users? If I mount a filesystem that's been part of another Ubuntu installation (systemB let's call it) how does my system (systemA) work out permissions? Specifically:\n\n\n*\n\n*Does userA on my system get access to userA's files in the foreign filesystem from systemB just because they have the same name? Must the passwords match? That implies to me that the filesystem must store user+password together somewhere so they can travel with the filesystem.\n\n*What happens if there is a userB on systemB and no matching user on my system? Who can access his files from systemA? Can root?\n\n\nA: Permissions are granted based on the user ID in /etc/password. The names are just a convenience. (BTW, that is also the way it is done on windows).\nExample: \nLocal system 'A' had a disk with this setup:\n\nJoe,            uid 500\nJane,           uid 501\nJob,            uid 502\n\nFiles created by Joe get user ID 500.\nNow I move that disk to system 'B'\nSystem B has two users:\n\nJanette,        uid 500\nslartibartfast, uid 501\nMark,           uid 599\n\nFiles which were owned by user 500 (Joe) on system 'A' will now be accesable by user 500 on system 'B'. The owner will be listed as 'Janette'\nThis is the main reason why people keep their UIDs the same on all systems they log into. Esp. when NFS is involved.\n\n(To be complete: Fles owner by 'Jane' will now show up as owned by 'slartibartfast', and files owned by 'Job' will just be listed by ID 502, since there is not matching name.)\nIf you like an analogy, think of uids as social security numbers. Your name can change (e.g. when you marry), but that number will always be the same.\n\n[Edited a bit to answer the questions directly]\n\nIf I mount a filesystem that's been part of another Ubuntu installation (systemB let's call it) how does my system (systemA) work out permissions?\n\nThe system works out permission by checking if the active user has rights on the file, or if the active user is in a group which has rights on that file. Everywhere I wrote active user you need to realise that the user is just a number. (The ID).  And this ignores extra restrictions set by SE-Linux.\n\nSpecifically: Does userA on my system get access to userA's files in the foreign filesystem from systemB just because they have the same name?\n\nNo. Only if they have the same uid.\n\nMust the passwords match? \n\nNo password checking it done when you access file. You authenticate once (when you log in). Afterward you have rights on files which you own or which are in the same groups you are in.\n\nThat implies to me that the filesystem must store user+password together somewhere so they can travel with the filesystem.\n\nNo password checking is done on accessing files, so this is not relevant.\n\nWhat happens if there is a userB on systemB and no matching user on my system?\n\nIf there is no user with the same uid then it is not possible to translate the uid to a name. Thus the raw numeric value is show.\n\nWho can access his files from systemA? Can root?\n\nEvery user with the same uid, or with uid 0.\n", "Q: Installing programs on Ubuntu Live Is there possibly a way of installing a program on Ubuntu Live (on USB) and the have it there like a all preinstalled programs (such as Open Office)?\nIf it were possible, it'd be so great!\nThanks.\n\nA: Yes.

These are written in C and are linked directly in the Python executable.  You can find out what these are like this:\n$ python\nPython 2.7.4 (default, Apr 19 2013, 18:28:01) \n[GCC 4.7.3] on linux2\nType \"help\", \"copyright\", \"credits\" or \"license\" for more information.\n>>> import sys\n>>> sys.builtin_module_names\n('__builtin__', '__main__', '_ast', '_bisect', '_codecs', '_collections', '_functools', '_heapq', '_io', '_locale', '_md5', '_random', '_sha', '_sha256', '_sha512', '_socket', '_sre', '_struct', '_symtable', '_warnings', '_weakref', 'array', 'binascii', 'cPickle', 'cStringIO', 'cmath', 'errno', 'exceptions', 'fcntl', 'gc', 'grp', 'imp', 'itertools', 'marshal', 'math', 'operator', 'posix', 'pwd', 'select', 'signal', 'spwd', 'strop', 'sys', 'syslog', 'thread', 'time', 'unicodedata', 'xxsubtype', 'zipimport', 'zlib')\n\nvirtualenv env works by copying /usr/bin/python2.7 into env/bin/python, and then symlinking all the standard library modules into env/lib/python2.7/*.py.\nWhen you upgrade your system Python, you automatically get the updated standard library in all your virtualenvs (because symlinks!), but you're still using the old copy of the Python executable.  This means you're also using the old versions of the builtin modules.\nSome standard library modules depend on builtin modules.  And sometimes Python 2.7.(x+1) standard library depends on builtin modules that got introduced in Python 2.7.(x+1) too. By using an old virtualenv you're in effect trying to use Python 2.7.x with the standard library of Python 2.7.(x+1), and sometimes this breaks.\nRe-creating the virtualenv is the correct solution.\n(It's probably sufficient to replace the bin/python and bin/python2.7 executables inside the virtualenv, assuming that no new stdlib files appeared in the updated system Python.)\n\nA: You have to replace the python version in your corrupted virtualenv. \nDo this: \n\n\n*\n\n*Create a new Virtualenv \nmkvirtualenv MyNewTestEnv\n\n\n*Locate \"python\" (in my case the virtualenvs are located in the home directory)\ncd ~/.virtualenvs/MyNewTestEnv/bin\n\n\n*Copy \"python\" from the new virtualenv into your corrupted virtualenv\ncp ~/.virtualenvs/MyNewTestEnv/bin/python ~/.virtualenvs/<yourCorruptedEnv>/bin\n\nThat's it. Now your CorruptedEnv should be fixed.\n\nA: Please note I add this answer to get the question out of the unanswered queue.\nAs you suggest yourself in your second edit,\n\nThe gcc error above can be fixed by installing the build-essential debian package.\n\n\nA: you dont need to delete the virtual environment.\nJust follow this steps. let's say your virtual environment name is \"mydev\"\n1) virtualenv mydev\nThe above command just upgrade without losing any package.\n2)outside virtualenv, if your pip is not working, then just \"easy_install pip\" will resolve the issue\n", "Q: Unity lost almost all shortcuts I have a Dell latitude E6530 laptop with NVidia video card that was working fine with the default video driver. \nAfter a normal package update (~1 week ago) and a restart, boot resulted in a blank screen and I could run Ubuntu only with safe mode.\nIn safe mode all my \"cool\" shortcuts were disabled. i.e.\nctrl+Super+ LeftKey\nCtri+Super+ RightKey\nCtrl+Alt+Numpad [1379]\nSuper+w\nand Alt+Tab had a very flat design  (I think I was switched to Unity2D)\n\nI managed to restore normal boot by installing the nvidia driver (nvidia-current) and reinstalling X11.\nHowever the shortcuts were not restored and I am still in Unity 2D.\nI cannot even see these shortcuts in the system preferences anymore so I am not sure if Ubuntu decided to ditch them completely or I can restore them in another way\n\nA: maybe this bug affecting nvidia users\nhttps://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/compiz/+bug/1166765\ntry the temp fix - open a terminal    and execute the following:\n$ gsettings reset org.compiz.core:/org/compiz/profiles/unity/plugins/core/ active-plugins\n$ shutdown -r now\nfixes it but maybe not permanently yet so keep this note handy.\n\nA: I installed Bumblebee and after a reboot all worked out\n\nA: This actually solved it for me, so I now can use the new drivers\ngsettings reset org.compiz.core:/org/compiz/profiles/unity/plugins/core/ active-plugins\n\n", "Q: Turn off Auto Search in Nautilus 3.8 Does anyone know how to turn off the auto search in nautilus 3.8.

This question is about color management and the use of a higher color depth, 10 bits per channel (30 bits in total, resulting in 1.07 billion colors, or 1024 shades of gray, sometimes referred to as \"deep color\") compared to the standard of 8 bits per channel (24 bits in total, 16.7 million colors, 256 shades of gray, sometimes referred to as \"true color\"). Do not confuse with \"32 bit color\", which usually refers to standard 8 bit color with an extra channel (\"alpha channel\") for transparency (used to achieve effects like semi-transparent windows etc).\nThe following can be assumed to be in place:\n1: A wide-gamut monitor that supports 10-bit input. Further, it can be assumed that the monitor has been calibrated to its native gamut and that an ICC color profile has been created.\n2: A graphics card that supports 10-bit output (and is connected to the monitor via DisplayPort).\n3: Drivers for the graphics card that support 10-bit output.\nIf applications that support 10-bit output and color profiles would be used, I would expect them to display images that were saved using different color spaces correctly. For example, both an sRGB and an adobeRGB image should be displayed correctly. If an sRGB image was saved using 8 bits per channel (almost always the case), then the 10-bit signal path would ensure that no tonal gradients were lost in the conversion from the sRGB of the image to the native color space of the monitor.\nFor example:\nIf the image contains a pixel that is pure red in 8 bits (255,0,0), the corresponding value in 10 bits would be (1023,0,0). However, since the monitor has a larger color space than sRGB, sending the signal (1023,0,0) to the monitor would result in a red that was too saturated. Therefore, according to the ICC color profile, the signal would be transformed into a different value with less red saturation, for example (987,0,0). Since there are still plenty of levels left between 0 and 987, all 256 values (0-255) for red in the sRGB color space of the file could be uniquely mapped to color-corrected 10-bit values in the monitor's native color space.\nHowever, if the conversion was done in 8 bits, (255,0,0) would be translated to (246,0,0), and there would now only be 247 available levels for the red channel instead of 256, degrading the displayed image quality.\nMy question is: how does this work on Ubuntu? Let's say that I use Firefox (which is color-aware and uses ICC color profiles). Would I get 10-bit processing, thus preserving all levels of an 8-bit picture? What is the situation like for other applications, especially photo applications like Shotwell, Rawtherapee, Darktable, RawStudio, Photivo etc?\nDoes Ubuntu differ from other operating systems (Linux and others) on this point?\n\nA: \n\"Bit wise, there shouldn't be a problem whether you render in 8 or 10,\n  but there's a major problem with linux anyway with bit-depths. In\n  linux, there unfortunately is no front-end software that allows you to\n  change the bit-depth. The ONLY way to change bit-depth in linux, is to\n  compile your video drivers to call 10 bits per channel for your\n  interfaces, instead of 8.\"\n\nActually Nvidia GeForce Drivers have supported 10 bit per channel in Linux for a while now.   Of course, you're going to need a display with 10 bit per channel color support connected via a DisplayPort to your video card for it to work.\nIn contrast, with Windows, only the Nvidia Drivers for their Quadro Cards allow 10 bit per channel color.  But, most applications don't work with it (since the Windows desktop itself is 8 bits per channel, and it's difficult to implement 10 bits per channel color on part of the screen like you'd see with an image editing application.  But, Photoshop has 10 bit per channel working in Windows using either AMD Firepro cards or Nvidia Quadro cards with CS6.   With Photoshop CC, I've seen reports of problems with Firepro cards though.   \nBasically, Windows requires \"Pro\" cards (AMD Firepro or Nvidia Quadro) to get that feature (10 bit per channel color with applications that support it), as the drivers for AMD Radeon Cards and Nvidia GeForce cards do not support the 10 bit per channel OpenGL buffers used by applications like Photoshop.   See this page for some info on that from Nvidia:\nhttp://nvidia.custhelp.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/3011\nBut, interestingly, the Nvidia Proprietary Linux drivers for GeForce Cards do support 10 bit per channel OpenGL buffers if you have a card with a DisplayPort and a Display that supports 10 bits per channel.   They added 10 bit per channel (a.k.a., 30 bit) color support to their Linux drivers beginning with 295.20.  Here's an old Phoronix article mentioning it:\nhttp://www.phoronix.com/scan.php?page=news_item&px=MTA1NzM\nIf you go to the Nvidia X-Server Control Panel in Linux, and look under Display Settings, you should see a Color Depth choice if the detected monitor is capable of 10 bits per channel and connected by a Display Port.   You'll see a 30 bit choice marked as Experimental there.   Or, you can just select X Screen 0 (versus the detected display) and see the color depth choice that way (where it defaults to 24 bit but will have 30 bit available in the drop down list).   Of course, you don't want to select that choice unless you have a true 30 bit (10 bit per channel) hardware setup (card with a DispayPort with a monitor connected to it with a true 10 bit per channel color panel).\n\nA: There's a few major problems with this, which I will address later.\nIf you 'assign' a smaller color profile(sRGB) to a larger color profile, you will of course have a change in the RGB values. The only way to safely preserve the original sRGB values, is to use the 'convert' option, which converts the color mode or 'Lab' designation and trys to preserve the original hues, or unassign the color profile and let the software use it's default rgb rendering.\nBit wise, there shouldn't be a problem whether you render in 8 or 10, but there's a major problem with linux anyway with bit-depths. In linux, there unfortunately is no front-end software that allows you to change the bit-depth. The ONLY way to change bit-depth in linux, is to compile your video drivers to call 10 bits per channel for your interfaces, instead of 8.\n\nA: Um... \nWindows supports at least 16bpp output since Windows 7.  The post talking about the NVidia 10bit drivers not working on Windows because the OS is limited to 8bpp is VERY, VERY WRONG.\nThis information has been available since 2008 at the WinHEC when it was first announced and demonstrated for Windows 7 and used in production on Windows 7 in 2009 when it was release with both ATI and NVidia drivers offering at least 10bpp support. (Sources: Wiki, MSDN, WinHEC,etc.)\nThere are a lot of professionals using 30bit and 48bit displays with Windows 7/8/10, that are not dithering/downsampling the color from the OS to the display. (Sources: Wiki, MSDN, Adobe, Autodesk, RenderMan, etc.)\nExtra Note: \nOS X just recently added 10bit color support for OS X 10.11 (2015)  Which is sadly really late, especially when Apple is requiring the use of their new GPU framework to even use it. \n", "Q: Static Wireless IP - Can Only Access Internet Using IPs I am using Lubuntu 12.10 as a local server and I am trying to get a static IP from my wireless network.

If the soft option\n                  is specified, then the NFS client fails an  NFS  request\n                  after  retrans  retransmissions  have been sent, causing\n                  the NFS  client  to  return  an  error  to  the  calling\n                  application.\n\n                  NB:  A  so-called  \"soft\"  timeout can cause silent data\n                  corruption in certain  cases.  As  such,  use  the  soft\n                  option only when client responsiveness is more important\n                  than data integrity.  Using NFS over TCP  or  increasing\n                  the value of the retrans option may mitigate some of the\n                  risks of using the soft option.\n\n\n\n*\n\n*http://manpages.ubuntu.com/manpages/natty/man5/nfs.5.html\nThe NFS Faq on sourceforge recommends using intr along with hard though, but I can't find a datestamp for the relevancy of this recommendation:\n\nsoft \nIf a file request fails, the NFS client will report an error to\n  the process on the client machine requesting the file access.

This is one question I've had for quite some time and while looking for answers I have more questions arising. I was trying to find a way to compress pictures in a folder using convert in one command.\nFirst I simply tried:\nconvert * -resize 50% Pic.jpg\n\nHowever this returned the compressed pictures named Pic-0.jpg, Pic-1.jpg, etc. (I also tried $(find \".JPG\") instead of * but this is expanded to the same. In order to have the formatting I wanted I tried:\nconvert * -resize 50% Pic_lorez_{1..3}.jpg\n\nBut this seemed to take the Pic_lorez_2.jpg and Pic3_lorez_3.jpg as input files, not output files. So following the advice of a friend, I tried:\nfind . -name \"*.JPG\" -exec convert {} -resize 50% {} \\;\n\nThis compress all files under the same name but doesn't allow to put the name I want to these files (for example, Pic_lorez_{1,2,3,4,5,..100}.jpg).\nWould xargs make it possible? Something along the lines of:\nfind . -name \"*.JPG\" | xargs convert ???\n\nI couldn't figure out the proper syntax with xargs. I finally tried a direct pipe of find into convert but convert didn't seem to be able to work that way.\n\nA: convert writes to a different image file.

Here's a guide about it:\nKeenformatics -  How to solve Dell laptops fan issues in Ubuntu\nand a discussion here on askubuntu:\nDell Inspiron 5521 i7-3317U Fan CPU too Noisy\nHere are the main steps as written on Keenformatics site (my blog).\nHow To solve Dell laptops fan issues in Ubuntu\n\n*\n\n*First of all, let's download and install i8kutils. Open your terminal and write:\n\nsudo apt-get install i8kutils\n\n\n*Now you've got to add i8k to your modules. Open the modules file:\n\nsudo gedit /etc/modules\nand add the string \"i8k\" (without quotes) to the file. Save and exit.\n\n\n*Create an i8k.conf file\nsudo vim /etc/modprobe.d/i8k.conf\nand fill it with this code:\noptions i8k force=1\nNote: Some older guides will tell you to create a /modprobe.d/options file. The \"options\" file isn't used anymore on Ubuntu. What does matter is that you create a file with a .conf extension (the filename isn't important, but I decided to name it i8k.conf for clarity). So beware of older i8kmon configuration guides.\n\n\n*Now restart your computer, or run this code to make i8k run:\n\nsudo modprobe i8k force=1\n\n\n*We will now create a i8kmon.conf file which will tell the i8kmon utility how to behave.\n\nsudo gedit /etc/i8kmon.conf\nPaste the following code in it:\n    # Run as daemon, override with --daemon option\n    set config(daemon)      0\n     \n    # Automatic fan control, override with --auto option\n    set config(auto)        1\n     \n    # Report status on stdout, override with --verbose option\n    set config(verbose) 1\n     \n    # Status check timeout (seconds), override with --timeout option\n    set config(timeout) 20\n     \n    # Temperature thresholds: {fan_speeds low_ac high_ac low_batt high_batt}\n    set config(0)   {{-1 0}  -1  40  -1  40}\n    set config(1)   {{-1 1}  30  60  30  60}\n    set config(2)   {{-1 2}  53  128  53  128}\n     \n    # For computer with 2 fans, use a variant of this instead:\n    # Temperature thresholds: {fan_speeds low_ac high_ac low_batt high_batt}\n    # set config(0) {{-1 0}  -1  52  -1  65}\n    # set config(1) {{-1 1}  41  66  55  75}\n    # set config(2) {{-1 1}  55  80  65  85}\n    # set config(3) {{-1 2}  70 128  75 128}\n     \n    # end of file\n\nThis has been edited to match my Dell Inspiron 15r 5521 fan configuration (and I hope I did it well). If you want more informations take a look at the documentation on Ubuntu Manuals: http://manpages.ubuntu.com/manpages/gutsy/man1/i8kmon.1.html\n\n\n*Now you should be able to run i8kmon from your terminal and see if (and how) it's working. Simply run:\n\ni8kmon\nFinished!\n", "Q: Why are Youtube videos not playing properly on chrome? I've had Ubuntu for quite some time now and youtube and everything has worked spectacular!

My question is if: I have a partition in the C: drive, and then install Ubuntu with flash drive, can I still use Ubuntu once Windows 7 deactivates?\n\nA: The activation state of Windows will not have any effect on Ubuntu. So, yes, you will be able to use Ubuntu just like you can right now.\n\nA: Without a shadow of a doubt: yes, you will be able to use Ubuntu and format you disc after it runs out.\n\nMicrosoft uses software on your machine to check if your OS is validated.

I was about to delete my system and do a fresh install when I realized that there is a recovery option in which I can reset my user password.\nUsing How do I reset a lost administrative password? I have set a new password for my user.\nAfter rebooting I can log-in in Unity using my new password but I am thrown back to the Unity screen immediately. (No message about false password)\nUsing the terminal I can log in using the new user-password.\nHow can I re-enable my machine to decrypt my ecrypfs encrypted home with the unwrapped passphrase I know?\n\nA: if  home directory is encrypted, you should not change your password  using the passwd command.\nIf someone forgets their login password, and home directory is encrypted,  you should not try to reset it with the methods listed in other sites, such as manual editing of /etc/shadow or sudo passwd user using a different account, etc etc. \nIndeed if you do, then your new login password will not decrypt your home directory, and you will see that behaviour you describe : at graphical login the password is accepted, but then the user is immediatly kicked out, since the home dir cannot be decrypted and accessed. \nIt seems you were wise enough to have a stored copy of the unwraped ecryptfs password. In that case there are ecrypt  tools to solve the problem .\nSee http://blog.dustinkirkland.com/2011/04/introducing-ecryptfs-recover-private.html\nPeople who did not store it, and do not remember the old login password, may have a look into this  http://mennucc1.debian.net/shadow_crack/\n\nA: I had the exact same problem. I changed my password using passwd. That messed things up because of the encrypted home directory. The above link contains a solution:\nlogin to terminal\n$ ecryptfs-mount-private\n\nYou need to know your old password to mount.\n\nThis will unlock and mount your /home/$USER. At this point, we can\n  access /home/$USER. So just cd back into it and run…\n\n$ ecryptfs-rewrap-passphrase ~/.ecryptfs/wrapped-passphrase\n\n\nIt’ll prompt you for your old password, and you can enter a new one afterward.\n  You will need to change the password for your keyring as well.\n  From your menu bar – [Applications] => [Accessories] => [Passwords and Encryption Keys]\n  Under Passwords tab – right-click “Passwords: login” and “Change Password”\n\nBased on grayfox May 17 at 19:28 - http://unixtitan.net/main/2010/11/16/annoyance-changing-password-with-ecryptfs/\n(I don't have enough reputation to comment his answer)\n", "Q: How should I set up a FQDN and Intranet Sandbox 12.10 Server that won't be public Am trying to install virtualmin and it doesn't like the hostname as the FQDN. When doing the Ubuntu install I called it BLAHBLAH-VPS. The virtualmin script trips over that and asks me for a FQDN. Since this machine is mostly a sandbox and will not be public to the outside, not sure what my /etc/hosts and /etc/hostname files should have in them.\n/etc/hosts as follows:\n127.0.0.1   localhost\n127.0.1.1   blahblah-VPS\n\n# The following lines are desirable for IPv6 capable hosts\n::1     ip6-localhost ip6-loopback\nfe00::0 ip6-localnet\nff00::0 ip6-mcastprefix\nff02::1 ip6-allnodes\nff02::2 ip6-allrouters\n192.168.0.2 blahblahblah.is-a-geek.com\n\n/etc/hostname as follows:\nBLAHBLAH-VPS\n\nThere is some commentary regarding how the FQDN is a critical aspect of the virtualmin install. \n\nA: I usually configure the hostname of any Debian or Ubuntu machine as \n/etc/hosts\n127.0.0.1 host.example.com host localhost.localdomain localhost\n\n/etc/hostname\nhost\n\nand verify that hostname -s returns the short hostname and hostname -f the FQDN of the machine.

Actually i need files from my home directory, it's only reason stops me to reinstall ubuntu.\nHow can i log in or get files from root.disk (i also have windows 7 on my computer)\n\nA: You can also use ext2read from Windows (read only). \nIf you are trying to repair it you can do the following:\n\n\n*\n\n*Run chkdsk /f from Windows first. If it's the C: drive you'll need to reboot to complete the check.\n\n*If you have a live CD, I'd recommend trying to repair first by fscking the root.disk (see the Wubi Guide for help). This sounds like what is required based on your description, but I'd still run chkdsk first.\n\n*If both those fail, then you can fall back to the backup and reinstall.

This virtual folder will be assigned to one of your mail accounts and displayed in its list of folders, but you can configure it to search in any folder of any account.\nDo a search for your work-related mails, for example \"Tags include 'work'\" or \"From includes 'my-company.com'\". At the bottom of that dialog, there should be a button to store that search as a virtual folder.\nPressing that button should give you another dialog. There you can set the virtual folders name, at which account it should be displayed, which folders it should search in and the search criteria. \nWith that, you can for example create a virtual folder called \"work for my-company.com\" under your Gmail account, that searches in Gmail/work, Yahoo/work and Yahoo/other-stuff for mails that have been sent from an @my-company.com address or are tagged \"work\".\n", "Q: Can't boot Ubuntu 12.10 graphics problem I can't boot since installing Ubuntu 12.10\nWhen I try to run Ubuntu My computer never gets to the Ubuntu screen with the loading dots.

I've been able to consistantly get into a safemode desktop environment using the xorg & nouveau drivers.  \nI've tried switching between the 5 different options in the Additional Drivers tab in Software Sources. The nVidia (proprietary, tested) driver gets beyond the GPU lockup on a normal boot and actually gets into a Desktop.

I've tried switching to the (prop, tested) driver and then reinstalling Unity and Ubuntu-Desktop but that didn't work either. \n\nA: Some of this parts are taken from How do I install the Nvidia drivers? and modified for this particular case:\nFirst I need for you to remove all installed Nvidia packages. Go to the Additional Drivers and uninstall the one you have. \n\nReboot and make sure you are using the open source Nouveau driver.\nAfter that do the following in your case:\nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:xorg-edgers/ppa\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get upgrade\nNow let us install the correct driver:\nFirst let us try the 304 version. You can use one of the following methods:\nsudo apt-get install nvidia-graphics-drivers-304\nsudo apt-get install nvidia-304\nNow Reboot and test it out. If it works great then try the 310 driver simply by changing the above 304 to 310. If it works, great. Try the 319. In you particular case, since the video card is almost old, I would stick with the 304.\nI would also execute the following to make sure it creates the xorg.conf file to save you some issues:\nsudo nvidia-xconfig\nTest this out and let me know.\n", "Q: How do I change the screen resolution using Ubuntu command line?

Do someone know how the two systems might interfere with each other?\n\nA: After some research, I found out that yes, Ubuntu can have an indelicate behaviour towards Windows audio settings and drivers.\nAn issue similar to the one I encountered was reported as a bug on Launchpad, as well as on the Ubuntu forum in 2009. As written below, shutting down my computer (instead of restarting it) then booting into Windows, allowed me to make use of my headphones jack output on Win7.\nHere come more insight from the above mentionned forum thread:\n\n\nI've read somewhere else that there's a problem in the way Ubuntu releases the Sound Card drivers or hardware itself, and when it reboots, Windows can't grab the device. It deactivates it, in some sort of way.\nTurn on PC, boot Windows - Sound Works\n    Turn on PC, boot Ubuntu - Sound Works\n    Turn on PC, boot Windows, THEN Ubuntu - Sound Works, both times.\n    Turn on PC, boot Linux, THEN Windows - Sound Works only in Ubuntu\n    Turn on PC, boot Windows, then Linux, THEN Windows - Sound works until 3rd reboot.\n    Turn on PC, boot Linux, then Windows, then Linux - Sound works at 1st and at 3rd time.\nIf I shut down, no matter what, sound works.\n\n\nI also found a possible solution from Launchpad - 5th comment of bug #453395 - but didn't try it, since it's for Ubuntu version 9.10 and I'm not sure it would be safe with my 12.04 version.\n\n\nI was lucky to find a solution to this problem, when reading about other problem. When you edit /etc/init.d/alsa-utils, and comment the 378th line:\nmute_and_zero_levels \"$TARGET_CARD\" || EXITSTATUS=1\nthe sound seems to work properly after restart from Ubuntu to Windows. Hope it will work for you too.\n\n\n", "Q: Monodevelop MVC Development Adding a View I am building an MVC project on monodevelop, but I am having difficulties adding a view. When I click on the add view button, I encounter an error. \nI think this error is already known by the monodevelop team as I found a ticket associated to this error here:\nhttps://bugzilla.xamarin.com/show_bug.cgi?id=6036\nMy questions are:\n\n\n*\n\n*Is this error fixed? I am using MonoDevelop 3.0.3.2, which I installed on Ubuntu 12.10 using apt-get install monodevelopI attempted to update the version, but I'm not sure if its either up to date or if there is something about installing it in this manner.\n\n*Is there a work-around for this?\n\nA: *\n\n*Yes it is fixed, but not in Ubuntu packages. It seems 13.04 has the same version of MonoDevelop as 12.10, so it should be still broken. You can try to submit a bug report and see if they update the package to a newer version.\n\n*The only workaround I know is to install a newer version of MonoDevelop. To do this, you can either use a PPA or build it yourself.\nUsing a PPA\nA quick search returned this PPA. It provides the latest build of MonoDevelop, so if someone commits some change in the source code, those packages should be rebuilt and updated.\nI have not used it, so I can't tell you how stable it is. Also as it offers MonoDevelop 4, during installation your mono runtime should be upgraded as well.\nSo, if using a PPA is an option and you want to have the latest and greatest MonoDevelop:\nsudo apt-add-repository ppa:keks9n/monodevelop-latest \nsudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install monodevelop-latest \n\nBuilding MonoDevelop by yourself\nTo build MonoDevelop, you need first to clone their git repo and required modules:\ngit clone git://github.com/mono/monodevelop.git\ncd monodevelop\ngit submodule init\ngit submodule update\n\nAfter that you need to checkout the version you want. I only tried 3.1, but you can select a newer version:\ngit checkout monodevelop-3.1-series\n\nNext, you need to install the build dependencies. You may want to take note of what will be installed, in case you want to remove them after compilation.\nsudo apt-get build-dep monodevelop\n\nFinally, you need to compile it as usual:\n./configure --prefix=/usr/local --profile=stable\nmake -j 4\nsudo make install\n\nNote: if you want you can replace make install with checkinstall: instead of copying the files to your root filesystem it will create a debian package (which is a lot easier to (un)install) and install it.\nsudo checkinstall --pkgname=monodevelop-mygitbuild\n\nUsing this if you later need to remove it you just do a sudo apt-get remove monodevelop-mygitbuild.\nAt the end, you can run your build of MonoDevelop in a terminal with /usr/local/bin/monodevelop. If everything works fine you can create a launcher (you can use /usr/share/applications/monodevelop.desktop as base).\n", "Q: Access lenovo ideapad (z580) bios with ubuntu installed ubuntu seems to block my access to the bios of my system.\nI know this for sure since this problem occur only since I installed ubuntu (12.10). while the system is booting, pressing F2 leads me to grub.\nHow may I access my bios?\n\nA: Press and hold F2, then power on.

I have Steam installed on Win7 in D:\\Games\\PC\\Steam. I installed Steam on my Ubuntu now and for Half-Life 2: Deatmatch it asked wether to install in the default folder or somewhere else. I chose the same folder as for Windows to avoid having games doubled, on Ubuntu it's /media/Media/Games/PC/Steam. It didn't download anything and was instantly ready to play. When I chose to install Team Fortress 2 it didn't ask me where to install. I read that some games, like TF2, can be installed only in the default game library folder. Will those that are installed in the same folder as the Windows Steam is create any conflicts?\nThanks in advance.\n\nA: To change the default Download folder,\nJust quit Steam (important!) and move the entire Steam folder to another location\nmv ~/.local/share/Steam /new/path\nand start Steam again.

I'd like to use juju on my server at home to get to know juju and play with it. I have multiple computers and would like to access what's on the server from any of them. When I went through the tutorial it setup juju okay, but only exposed the services to the local machine. I want to expose them to the whole network. How can I do this?\nNote: my server already exists and is running 12.04, I don't want to reinstall it using maas just to get juju working. I also don't want to run this \"in the cloud\" on ec2 or any other provider because I want to try this out on my own machine under my control on my network.\nEdit:-\n\n\n*\n\n*No firewall\n\n*No blocking, all ports open\n\n*Yes.

While I could go around setting up ssh port forwarding all over the place to access the 10.x IP addresses from the 192.168.1.0/24 range, this seems overcomplicated and unnecessary. I'd like the containers exposed over my LAN.\n\nA: For what I am able to understand, you have Juju installed and working but you want to expose a service to other computers on your network. I will assume all the computers on your network can see each other and have their IP addresses correct.\nI am also guessing the tutorial you are talking about is one of this:\n\n*\n\n*How do I configure juju for local usage?\n\n*Getting started with Juju\nthen I would imagine that if you want to make the service available for other computers you would do this:\njuju expose SERVICE\n\nUsing How to install Hadoop? as the example I would:\njuju expose hadoop-master\n\nJuju Expose - https://jujucharms.com/docs/stable/charms-exposing\njuju status SERVICE also helps in figuring out how the service is working.\nOf course there are a couple of things I would need to know about the network and the server, for instance:\n\n*\n\n*Does the server have a firewall setup (iptables, ufw...)\n\n*Does the network have a router configured to do something related to blocking, forwarding and such that would create a problem trying to access the server?\n\n*Do the computers on the LAN see the server?\n\n*Is there any special connection that is not common (Wireless or Wired) or security in used that could create a problem with the clients and server?\n\n*Are all the steps to setup Juju correctly done (As provided by the tutorials mentioned, specially the part about environments.yaml which I tend to forget or get wrong).\n\n*Does juju status give you some insight of what the problem could be?\n\n*Do you have multiple environments set up in the environments.yaml file?\n\nIn case the service is not shown to the outside because of LXC, do the following (Provided by the answer popey gave and a lot of research):\n\n*\n\n*Setup bridged network br0 in /etc/network/interfaces\n\n\n*Edit /etc/lxc/lxc.conf and set lxc.network.link=br0\n\n\n*Edit /etc/default/lxc and set LXC_BRIDGE, LXC_ADDR, LXC_NETMASK, LXC_NETWORK, LXC_DHCP_RANGE & LXC_DHCP_MAX appropriately to the LAN (192.168.1.0/24 type settings)\nNow juju status should show 192.168.1.0/24 addresses for my units and can be access over the LAN from another machine.\n\nA: Ok, solved!\nSetup bridged network br0 in /etc/network/interfaces. \nauto eth1\niface eth1 inet manual\n\nauto br0\niface br0 inet static\nbridge_ports eth1\naddress 192.168.1.2\nbroadcast 192.168.1.255\nnetmask 255.255.255.0\ngateway 192.168.1.1\nbridge_stp off\nbridge_fd 0\nbridge_maxwait 0\n\nEdit /etc/lxc/lxc.conf and set lxc.network.link=br0 \nlxc.network.type=veth\nlxc.network.link=br0\nlxc.network.flags=up\n\nEdit /etc/default/lxc and set LXC_BRIDGE, LXC_ADDR, LXC_NETMASK, LXC_NETWORK, LXC_DHCP_RANGE & LXC_DHCP_MAX appropriately for my LAN (192.168.1.0/24 type settings)\nnow juju status shows 192.168.1.0/24 addresses for my units and I can access them over the LAN from another machine\nLXC_BRIDGE=\"br0\"\nLXC_ADDR=\"192.168.1.2\"\nLXC_NETMASK=\"255.255.255.0\"\nLXC_NETWORK=\"192.168.1.0/24\"\nLXC_DHCP_RANGE=\"192.168.1.50,192.168.1.99\"\nLXC_DHCP_MAX=\"49\"\n\n", "Q: Python preferences on eclipse I'm using ubuntu 12.04\nIve installed eclipse and downloaded python for it\nBut when I go into the preferences I cannot find python\nI am a complete beginner at this even with commands in ubuntu terminal  I can do very little but I'm slowly learning\nFinally fixed this by uninstalling python from ecplise \nthen running ecplipse via command line as root\nupdated eclipse\nthen reinstalled python\n\nA: After uninstalling PyDev from eclipse and removing its update as-well I closed eclipse\nThen I run eclipse as root from the command line\nsudo eclipse\n\nI then reinstalled Pydev and all was OK\n", "Q: How to install Perrix gaming mouse on Ubuntu?

While I'd test this on a windows system to be sure (and to rule out the possibility that it simply dosen't work in windows), chances are the mouse is faulty (and i've had faulty mice work perfectly as a mouse, I just had problems changing settings on it) and that you ought to get it replaced.\nThere's a few things I'd check in troubleshooting the mouse in question in ubuntu\n\n\n*\n\n*check if the mouse is even detected with sudo lsusb \n\n*/dev/input/by-path has a series of files referring to input devices. using cat on one of those files will result in a series of ... odd looking characters when you use the device. `xev' is a x specific command that does similarly, but with more specific detail. \n\n\nIf your device is not in /dev/input/by-path , or lsusb, something is off.

When you insert your mobile broadband modem usb stick, it gets activated within 5 seconds or almost, and then modem is on (Modem manager); after several seconds, mobile broadband is enabled through the Network Manager (Network manager applet indicator); hence you manually click your setup connection to connect the modem to your provider network. That's cool.\nI changed the settings of a connection to AUTOMATICALLY CONNECT thinking that it would connect automatically to the network once the modem is inserted and on, and the network recognized. Unfortunately it it did not.\nIs it possible to achieve the above request?

When the screens get into the configuration shown in the 2nd screen shot, it screws up the \"redshift\"ing on the left monitor. Basically, the left monitor does not change color and yet the right one does. I typically just fix this by popping into nvidia-settings and changing the display configuration, but we all know that if you've got do something menial n number of times, that's probably n-1 too many times.\n\nA: 1) In your home directory create a text file name it .redshift\n2) Open this file with your favorite text editor such as vim or gedit\n3) Paste this script and save it:\nfor i in {0..3} \ndo\n   redshift -m vidmode:screen=$i -t 5500:4000 &\ndone  \n\nyou can use any argument as you like..\n4) make this script executable with command: chmod +x ~/.redshift\n5) Add a new line: sh ~/.redshift to the end of ~/.profile --this makes your script to run every time you log in.\n6) You can add an alias to this script to run ii manually and fast whenever you like:\nalias redshift=sh ~/.redshift\nadd this line to the end of ~/.bashrc file to make it persistant.\n", "Q: How to install packages that is already downloaded?

The timestamp on the PDF is later than on the word processing document, so that makes sense, but I am not absolutely sure that the word processing document produces exactly that PDF.  The document is 20 pages long so it's not a good idea to check it manually.  \nOne possibility is to redo the PDF in a different folder and then do a binary diff of the two PDFs.  Unfortunately the command line diff indicates that the \"binary files are different\".  \nIs there a \"smart binary diff\" that will help me determine if the difference is merely in meta data or some such non-consequential difference?  \n\nA: In general it is a good idea to check if command + file extension are what your are looking for. diff+pdf results in diffpdf. \nsudo apt-get install diffpdf\n\n\n\nDiffPDF is used to compare two PDF files. By default the comparison is of the text on each pair of pages, but comparing the appearance of pages is also supported (for example, if a diagram is changed or a paragraph reformatted). It is also possible to compare particular pages or page ranges. For example, if there are two versions of a PDF file, one with pages 1-12 and the other with pages 1-13 because of an extra page having been added as page 4, they can be compared by specifying two page ranges, 1-12 for the first and 1-3, 5-13 for the second. This will make DiffPDF compare pages in the pairs (1, 1), (2, 2), (3, 3), (4, 5), (5, 6), and so on, to (12, 13).\n\n\nSource: Ubuntugeek.com.\n", "Q: How to print only even or odd pages (HP LaserJet 1018) Sometimes I print two sided documents.

This question is just to get the latest answer from the experts.\nIs it still impossible to get a keyboard layout indicator in the top panel in gnome shell?\nMy personal experience says, it is impossible. I can use keyboard layout indicator in gnome classic, ubuntu, xfce, lxde! But not in gnome shell.\nAlso, will it still be impossible to use it even after release of ubuntu 13.04?\nFor whatever it is worth, I think it is quite strange and sad that what can be done in practically every other DE can not be done in gnome.\n\nA: If you mean something like this (Ubuntu 13.04 Gnome Remix): \n\nThe indication change when you switch layout with your selected keyboard switch combination.\nI installed the AppIndicator extension (https://extensions.gnome.org/extension/615/appindicator-support/ ) \nand then, after the first change of keyboard layout, you have a keyboard-layout notification in the gnome notification zone. Open ubuntu tweaks, extensions, select AppIndicator options:\n\nand be sure to select \"show in panel\"  for the keyboard indicator. \nHope this helps,\n    Romano\n\nA: So it would seem your actual problem is not with the indicator itself but with the panel label being broken/not being displayed. This problem has been present since at least 3.4 and I wrote a thorough comment discussing this before I understood your problem entirely. If I'm mistaken about the actual issue my apologies.\n\n(Note: the Login Screen link in the Region & Language panel lets you make the gdm login  indicator functional as well)\nTo clarify, I have only tested this in 3.8. Here is what I did:\nInstall Icon Hider extension from: Icon Hider on e.g.o\nOnce installed open the icon hider preferences by refreshing the page you installed from or iirc from the menu entry. Now set the \"keyboard\" entry to On and you should see the blank space.\nNext, since I only had one layout by default, and the menu showed I had 0, I decided to add one. Open the blank keyboard menu and launch \"Region & Language Settings\". If you have more than 1 layout already you should try removing all but your default/preferred language. WARNING: when you have only 1 enabled(3.8) the indicator automatically hides, so you should use the Icon Hider extension to hide/show it again as when you remove the 2nd it will hide. Then I added an alternate and finally the menu showed me an entry, as my default contained no pre-set layout so the menu showed no entry at all.\nNow that I added 2 it showed the entries and I selected one. \nThe result was the image above. I do hope this works but I'm guessing ymmv depending on your g:s version. \nOther information probably not of value if your issue is regarding the layout text/label:\nTechnically speaking, Gnome Shell should not be confused with Fallback, as G:S extensions do not work in fallback, but they will work in the new Classic mode which under 3.8 can be spawned by running:\n`gnome-shell --replace --mode=classic`\n\nBut under < 3.6 the Fallback mode does not run extensions, it runs normal panel \"applets\". I had better luck with the Keyboard indicator under Fallback than I ever do with G:S as under G:S the icon is broken and has been since I think 3.4.\nWhen you say it is not displayed in the panel, does that mean you see no icon but you can click the blank space where the icon should be and then use the menu properly?

If so we can probably find a means to get the icon working.\nIf it's that you don't see the indicator/menu with no icon, in G:S, than it's the matter of that indicator not being enabled in G:S.

You can use either to make sure /home is mounted.  free shows how much used/free ram/swap you have, so you can use that to verify that your swap partition is mounted, or cat /proc/swaps for a simple list of mounted swap partitions.\n\nA: A gui based tool is also an option. \nGParted provides a graphical view of devices and partitions.

Ubuntu uses generic drivers so it will have them installed already -but- sometimes you need to tweak them or block a specific module to have it working. I would suggest trying to find all the specifics for all the different hardware and have a look if others had trouble with that hardware (sometimes the hardware is MicroSoft only though this happens less and less).\nIf you come up short make a question on AU for each hardware part (but make sure to search first ;) )\n\nHow do I test whether all my hardware is properly working? \n\nOpen dash and start typing friendly. This will get you to a tool that tests your system.\n\nMore information can be found here (there is a video there and a run through of the program it starts).\nAt the end, if you ran all the test, it can  upload the results to the Friendly site so others can see what works.\n\nA: How do I test whether all my hardware is properly working? Is there any standard tool for error checking, benchmarking, etc for checking hardware? \nIn Ubuntu we have such option with an application named as System testing. You can open it from unity dash by typing as System Testing.\n\nAfter opening here , you can perform all your required tests. Its having everything you need.\n\nUpdate : if you haven't found it already installed in your Ubuntu , you can install it with \nsudo apt-get install checkbox\n\nHope that helps.\n\nA: I don't have high enough reputation to add this as a comment so:\nFor Ubuntu 16.04, when you search for \"System Testing\", the application is called \"Checkbox\", but does as explained above. It should be pre-installed in the system. \n", "Q: Installing newer version of Ubuntu I have a older model IBM Think-pad and I have successfully installed Ubuntu 9.04 and found that it is no longer supported. I have burned a copy of 12.10 onto a CD and tried without installing onto a desktop. When I have placed the same cd into the Think-pad, it does not recognize there is anything on the cd such as the OS. Are there any suggestions\n\nA: The CD has to be burned so that it is bootable (link). If you did that, then perhaps the BIOS is not configured to boot a CD (link).\nAlternative to a CD, you can boot and install from a USB (link). The BIOS will similarly have to be configured to boot a USB drive before the hard drive with the existing operating system.\n", "Q: Upstart with a script that start and finish their own processes I'm trying to setup in Upstart a script that launch several internal procs and kill them if is required\n$ listener.py -startall\n$ listener.py -killall\n\nI can run it with this settings:\n# Listener Service\n\ndescription     \"Listener Server\"\n\nstart on runlevel [2345]\nstop on starting rc RUNLEVEL=[016]\n\nexec /home/www-data/listener/bin/listener.py -startall\n\npre-stop        exec /home/www-data/listener/bin/listener.py -killall\n\nBut I'm wondering how run the command listener.py -killall to finish the service:\n$ sudo service listener stop\n$ stop: Unknown instance:\n\nMy upstart script only start the services but doesn't work when I try to stop it.\nThanks in advance.\n\nA: At Ubuntu plymouth.conf have some similar things with my case, then like plymouth.conf I added to my upstart script a sentence to mark the service like a process that fork more procs: expect fork\n# Listener Service\n\ndescription     \"Listener Server\"\n\nstart on runlevel [2345]\nstop on starting rc RUNLEVEL=[016]\n\nexpect fork\n\nexec /home/www-data/listener/bin/listener.py -startall\n\npre-stop        exec /home/www-data/listener/bin/listener.py -killall\n\nAnd now all is working Ok!\n", "Q: Nautilus sorting by filename column seems insane \nBy what logic does the kálmán track appear where it does?

GRUB can't switch boot modes, so you can't do what you want to do with your current GRUB installation. You'll have to add an EFI-mode GRUB (or some other EFI-mode boot program, such as rEFInd) to do the job. Unfortunately, doing this from your working installation is tricky, since it requires using an EFI-mode program called efibootmgr, and that won't work in your current BIOS-mode Linux boot, thus creating a chicken-and-egg conundrum. You can do it from an emergency Ubuntu disc booted in EFI mode, but that complicates the GRUB setup process. See my Web page on the topic for information on EFI boot loaders and how to install them manually if you want to try this. It's possible that Ubuntu's Boot Repair tool, run from an EFI-mode emergency disc, will be able to install an EFI-mode GRUB relatively painlessly, but I'm not really sure of that. I'm also not a fan of Boot Repair, since it's rather ham-fisted with its changes.\nAnother option is to abandon GRUB in favor of rEFInd. If you boot Linux in BIOS mode, mount /dev/sdb1 (your ESP) at /boot/efi, and then install the Debian package version of rEFInd, it should set itself up to launch the next time you boot the computer in EFI mode (you might need to select the \"Windows\" option to get it to boot). This works by using a workaround that's also a bit on the ham-fisted side, but not quite as bad as what Boot Repair does, IMHO. It's also reversible once you boot Linux in EFI mode: Type sudo mount /dev/sdb1 /boot/efi to mount the ESP again (creating an /etc/fstab entry for this is a good idea, no matter what solution you choose) and then type sudo mvrefind.sh /boot/efi/EFI/Microsoft/Boot /boot/efi/EFI/refind.\nA third option is to re-install Windows in BIOS mode. To do this, you'd need to wipe the partition table on /dev/sdb, converting it from GPT to MBR format, and then re-install Windows, ensuring that you do so in BIOS mode. This is the most inelegant solution, but if you're comfortable with Windows installation and have no data you need to preserve on /dev/sdb, it may be the most likely to succeed without causing complications.\n", "Q: How to remove ubuntu partitions and use them to install windows I have installed Ubuntu 12.10 on my laptop, but would like to install windows for the purpose of gaming (Hallelujah).

Emulate Windows. Hope it help. \n\nA: Installing Windows after Ubuntu\nThis is not hard as everyone says, but you need to be prepared before you start or you will leave the computer in an unbootable state.\nBasic procedure\n\n\n*\n\n*You can use gparted to resize a partition, but you must either boot from live media or be using a partition that is not mounted.\n\n*Decide how much space you can spare. You will find various opinions out there, but Win 7 needs at least 40 GB IMHO. With games installed, you may need more.\n\n*Back up your data. You have a lot of logical partitions. To delete logical partitions, you need to first be sure logical partitions with a higher number are unmounted. Moving partitions is not recommended. \n\n*You need to create a primary partition formatted as NTFS. If you can let go of /dev/SDA15 The easiest thing for you may be to A) delete it, B) shrink your extended partition, and C) use the new unallocated space for your Win partition.\n\n*Assuming you have a valid product key for Windows, when you insert the recovery discs or install dics, you need to choose the options that will not restore your computer to factory image or use the entire disk. The installer will be able to find the NTFS partition and install to that. The exact details of the Win installer menu are off-topic here, however, but you can find instructions for this part if you search. But be careful with this step; you don't want to accidentally blow away Ubuntu.\n\n*Once you have rebooted the computer into Windows, follow the steps for first time use, validate your product key, etc. But Windows will have changed the MBR, so you will not be able to boot Ubuntu.\n\n*You have a choice to stay with the Win bootloader and use EasyBSD or something to fix booting, but it's easiest to reinstall Grub2.\n\n*See Reinstalling Grub2, but here's the key part of that page. \nA) Boot from the live media.\nIn these examples, X is the drive letter (a, b, c, etc.); Y is the partition number (1, 5, etc):\nExample: sudo mount /dev/sdXY /mnt \nsudo mount /dev/sda1 /mnt\nExample: sudo grub-install --boot-directory=/mnt/boot /dev/sda \nsudo grub-install --boot-directory=/mnt/boot /dev/sda\nIn short, you mount the partition, but install to the drive. The actual commands  here are suggestions based on what you posted, but it's up to you to make sure you are installing Grub2 where you want it.\n\n*Now Ubuntu will boot but not Windows. Login to Ubuntu and sudo update-grub\n\nA: Open GParted and resize a partition.\n", "Q: Missing dependency packages when installing skype-call-recorder I am trying to install skype-call-recorder, following this tutorial\nHowever, I am getting dependency errors:\n~/Downloads$ sudo dpkg -i skype-call-recorder-ubuntu_0.8_i386.deb \n\n(Reading database ... 158095 files and directories currently installed.)\nPreparing to replace skype-call-recorder 0.8 (using skype-call-recorder-ubuntu_0.8_i386.deb) ...\nUnpacking replacement skype-call-recorder ...\ndpkg: dependency problems prevent configuration of skype-call-recorder:\n skype-call-recorder depends on libqt4-gui (>= 4.3); however:\n  Package libqt4-gui is not configured yet.\ndpkg: error processing skype-call-recorder (--install):\n dependency problems - leaving unconfigured\nErrors were encountered while processing:\n skype-call-recorder\n\nThen I tried: \n$ sudo apt-get install libqt4-gui\nReading package lists...

There are two variants:\n\n\n*\n\n*export SUDO_ASKPASS=/usr/libexec/openssh/ssh-askpass\n\n*vim /etc/sudoers  (Defaults visiblepw)\n\n\nA: In my case I've received this error because I wasn't specifying a command that I would like to use as root in the sudoers\nSomething like\n/etc/sudoers.d/myuser:\nmyuser ALL=(root) NOPASSWD: \\\n    /bin/ls -la\n\nworked for me\n\nA: Question:\nHow can I work around this?\nsudo: no tty present and no askpass program specified\n\nAlternate Answer\nAs an alternative, try:\nsudo -S ./[yourExecutable]\nThis directs sudo to read the password from the standard input, stdin.\nScenarios where this Helps\nIn chroot environments, these other answers may not work correctly ... perhaps because:\n\n\n*\n\n*/etc/shadow vs /etc/passwd conflict not allowing the user to enter a password.\n\n*In a chroot-ed environment, access to tty1 can be a bit glitchy, and ctrl-alt f2 -- to tty2 is unfeasible, because it is a tty of the non-chroot-ed environment.\n\n\nFor example: Manually installing / repairing linux or the bootloader, using a chroot environment, (such as Archlinux and arch-chroot).\n\nA: You can also create a file like \"sudo_shutdown\" in /etc/sudoers.d, with content:\n# Allow admins to shutdown without pass\n%adm ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD: /sbin/shutdown\n\nThis allows users which are in the adm group to shutdown without a password.\n\nA: A simple way is to specify -t:\nssh -t remotehost \"sudo ./binary\"\n\nFrom the man page:\n\nForce pseudo-tty allocation.  This can be used to execute arbitrary screen-based programs on a remote machine, which can be very useful, e.g. when implementing menu services.  Multiple -t options force tty allocation, even if ssh has no local tty.\n\nI cannot explain exactly why this works, and there may be a better way.

I'm writing an application using QML and some C++ code. The main window will be all QML (possibly having a main menu bar provided KXmlGuiWindow), with the backend and some dialogs written in C++. I've been using KDE because I'm using the KDE desktop and I like some of the extra features KDE provides, like KConfig XT. However, I'm planning on selling my application in the Ubuntu Software Center, so I assume my main target will be the standard Ubuntu with Unity. Knowing this, should I limit myself to using just Qt or is using the KDE frameworks not something to worry about?\nI've asked a similar question, and I understand KDE applications are allowed, but is there a good enough reason to choose pure Qt and not use the extra features KDE provides?\n\nA: Choosing pure Qt/QML will make it easier to also sell your application on the Phone and Tablet versions of Ubuntu, once the software store is available on Ubuntu Touch, as the KDE libs will not necessarily be available or usable, on those devices.\nChoosing to use KDE frameworks may make some things easier when developing, but will also result in a lot more dependencies being pulled in by your package, many of which may be wholly unnecessary for the most part.\nDeciding what to use is up to you. You'll have to decide where you want to compromise, and what the target market you want to sell your app to, is.\n", "Q: CUDA: nVidia card has fallen off the bus I am starting programming with CUDA but I am facing a very hard to fix problem: After some time the systems gives the error:\nNVRM: GPU at 0000:03:00.0 has fallen off the bus\nAnd the computer needs to be powered off to detect again the nVidia card. \nAt first I though it was a fault in my code: If I ran the same executable for 1000 times, the first 200 iterations were OK giving the same output, but then the system gave the aforementioned error and all the remaining iteration were giving errors. \nI then took the matrixMul example from cuda, compiled it, and ran it 1000 times. The same error happened around iteration 200!.

Read this here.\n\nA: WUBI is not supposed to work on 13.04. I know it still shows in the Daily images, but on the final official release it will be removed.\nThis is because WUBI has created many problems regarding the installation of Ubuntu, ranging from incompatibility between UEFI systems, to very rare errors that happen in Ubuntu because of a Wubi installed vs a LiveCD installed.\nYou can find the official warning on the Ubuntu site as mentioned by OMGUBUNTU: http://www.omgubuntu.co.uk/2013/04/wubi-advice\nOfficial Site: http://www.ubuntu.com/download/desktop/windows-installer\nYou can also find the information regarding the drop of WUBI: http://www.omgubuntu.co.uk/2013/04/wubi-unlikely-to-be-in-ubuntu-13-04-windows-users-lose-out\nAnd although it shows as a negative thing for Windows users, it actually encourages users to use the correct method by which they have less problems related to Ubuntu. Of course this will leave out the option of partitioning the drive from within Windows to avoid any problems related to it, but then again, this problems were mostly in Windows 8 with UEFI enabled.\n", "Q: Can't Install UVC drivers: \"implicit declaration of function 'x' [-Werror=implicit-function-declaration]\" I am working on a project for my final year project which involves the use of a web-cam.

Of course, you need to install the proprietary drivers for the AMD video card. The Intel one should get support out of the box. I would still invite you to try this questions which will help you even further along the road:\nWhich ATI/AMD, or Intel, or NVIDIA Graphics for Unity?\n(Simple way of letting users know which one to get)\nBumblebee or Ironhide?\n(In case you get a laptop with 2 video cards integrated)\nHow do I install the Nvidia drivers?\n(Extensive answer which covers many aspects of video cards)\nIf you want to know which one gives less problems (Comparing Nvidia and AMD only) when installing, upgrading, changing options (Resolution, Refresh Rate, OpenGL features) and setting it up in  general, the I would first go with Nvidia, then Ati.\nEven though Ati is more open to the Open Source environment, Nvidia with it's proprietary driver does a great job at lowering the amount of work a user needs to install one. For many users it can be as simple as installing the proprietary drivers that come in the Ubuntu repositories. For others is as easy as adding a PPA and installing the correct driver. Same applies for Ati but Nvidia (From my experience) has had and proven to offer a better way of handling installations, configurations and has even done a great job at Bug hunting.\n", "Q: Installing

using Ubuntu after hearing many good things about it. So far, I've been frustrated with the results.\nThe Unity Launcher doesn't respond on my computer at all, especially when I try to click the Transmission icon. I click it and nothing happens. It randomly happens to other applications as well. It does open when I click on the icon with the right mouse button and choose \"Start transmission minimized\" though.\nAlso, the menu is really jumpy and when I click something, it just scrolls up or down and ends up opening something else.\nI have been really disappointed with this Unity feature so far and I just want to switch back to my old OS because of it. \nCan someone help me? I really want to give Ubuntu 12.04 a chance. But it just seems so wrong.\nAs far as I recall, this didn't happen before the last update (at least I didn't notice it all THAT much before).\nAlso, I have this thing happening to me all the time:\n\nAnd my last issue is that each time I'm trying to open an external file (aka: I download a word document from my company's website), it just doesn't open it with the icon that was already in the menu when the OS was installed (I didn't move it and didn't do anything with it). It just randomly creates another icon.\nAs far as I understand, the Unity Launcher is a combined launcher and task bar. So the same icon is used to launch an application and to restore it, in case it in minimised or hidden. Now, when I open an odt file from my browser, by either opening it or saving to my computer and then opening, it doesn't use the LibreOffice Writer icon I already have, but it shows a new, additional LibreOffice Writer icon. Also, clicking the icon I already have closes all instances of Writer.\n\nWhat am I doing wrong? \n\nA: It is indeed a combined launcher and taskbar, sounds like your configuration is pretty f-up. Try holding down alt and pressing f2 to open the run dialogue and typing in unity --reset before pressing enter. The screen may flicker for a bit, but then things should be back to normal.\n\nA: First, file your problem as a bug by holding down Ctrl + Alt + T and then typing in 'ubuntu-bug unity' and following the instructions.\nThen, try pressing the 'Super' ('Windows') key, typing in 'Drivers' and hitting 'Enter', then click on the recommended proprietary driver (if you haven't already), click 'Activate' and reboot after it has activated. See if that helps.\nIt also might be that your computer is struggling to run Unity 3D so you should probably select Ubuntu 2D when you log in by clicking the white circle to the top-right of your name on the log in screen.\nIf you still can't use Unity (2D), try holding down Ctrl + Alt + T and typing in 'sudo apt-get install lubuntu-desktop', then (after installing) select Lubuntu when you log in by clicking the white circle to the top-right of your name on the log in screen. Lubuntu gives a more traditional desktop and is VERY lightweight so will almost definitely work on your system.\nI don't really get what you mean by the last problem. But if you are opening a word document, you can either:\n1. Click on the download in the downloads button in Firefox\n2. Click on the Writer button on the Launcher (or hit the 'Super' ('Windows') key and type in 'Writer' and press 'Enter') and then click 'File' > 'Open...' and select your file.\n3. Or click on the Home Folder icon (or hit the 'Super' ('Windows') key and type in 'Home' and press 'Enter'), double-click on Downloads and double-click on your file.\nSorry if the above sounds like I'm trying to dumb you down, I'm only trying to make it as clear as possible.\nNice one Handuel, should've thought of that (facepalm)\n", "Q: Migrating Ubuntu Music Library to an External Hard Drive? I have a very small internal hard drive, and I want to migrate my music library to an external hard drive. How would I do this?\n\nA: This is rather easy, if you are using a music player that keeps a database, such as Banshee or Clementine.\nAll you need to do, is cut and paste your music to a folder on the external hard drive, then import it to your music player. Just make sure that your music player's preferences are set to not import files to your ~/Music folder.\n", "Q: Is deleting my entire home folder contents like resetting everything to where it was during install? Or does Kubuntus install process generates something in there that is not generated like it is now after I deleted everything.\nSidequestion that led me to this is. Does 13.04 don't have the /home/user/bin automatically added to the path like it was before? Because I copied my scripts there and they are not working.\nThere is no .profile like it was before, because I deleted everything or because there simply is non in 13.04? If it is there normally where it comes from, how do I reset my home to defaults then?\nMaybe this is generated during the creation of a user? Any other things that might be missing now?\n\nA: This may not be the answer you're looking for, but I would say no. There are other folders like 'bin', 'usr', 'etc', etc. that have most likely been modified since your installation. So, unless you just installed and haven't downloaded any apps or modified anything, simply deleting the 'home' folder would not turn it into a clean slate.\n\nA: \nIs deleting my entire home folder contents like resetting everything to where it was during install?\n\nNo: some files are created when install or create a new user if you delete all your files you wont get the default files back.  Also changes do not only happen in your home directory.  This is especially true if you have installed or removed any software.\n\nDoesn't 13.04  have the /home/user/bin automatically added to the path like it was before?\n\nThis is set in your .profile file at least in 12.10 and older.  I would expect this to be true in 13.04 too.  But since its not officially released yet I have not upgraded my test machine.  If you have deleted all your home directory you will have deleted this file so it won't happen any more.\nIf you want to get back as it was with a fresh install I would just reinstall.  \nAn alternative would be to create a new user but make sure they are an administrator or they won't be able to use sudo.\n\nA: just an esample:\nthe file .bashrc will not be \"autoregenerate\"\nif you delete it, you will lose the autocomplete function in bash by tab button.\nSidequestion: are you script exe permission? (chmod a+x) if you copy the file via formatted fat32 key you lose this metadata.\nYes, the simplest way to reset the default option is creating a new user.\nPlease, don't be wondering if you delete all .config and something unwanted happen...\nUbuntu isn't black magik! :)\nps if you push \"ctrl h\" being in your home via graphic interface (not via bash), you will hide/show the .config file (if you didn't delete them...)\nBye\n\nA: As already explained, you will lose all the settings related to yourself. AFAIK, the bin thing is included in .profile but once you delete it you will be using the system one found in /etc/profile. Also, I think ubuntu uses setting files from /etc/skel when creating a user. You can copy .bashrc and .profile from this folder to your home.\n\nA: K, creating a new user in the KDE user management created exactly 3 files\n\n\n*\n\n*.bashrc\n\n*.profile\n\n*.bash_logout\n\n\nSo more and more believe that deleting all files except this 3 is almost exactly the same as if you would reinstall and login to the desktop the first time. I copy this files over, set permissions right and everything should be fine.\nThis following of course expect that there is nothing in there that is important and not backed up:\nI don't thing @gio900's concern that something bad would happen. Yes Ubuntu lacks black magic but thats fine because as I see it does not need anything special to do here. KDE/GNOME/WHATEVER APP will just create configs with defaults if nothing is there.

Complete Ubuntu newbie here.\nI'm installing Ubuntu 12.04 on an 11 year-old PC.\nSpecs to my knowledge are:\n\nProcessor: Intel Pentium 4 2.0 GHz\n  RAM: 512 RAM\n  Motherboard: Asrock P4VM800\n  Video Card: ATi Radeon 9550 (250mb)\n  Hard Drive: Single, 160gb\n\nThat single hard drive is split into 2 partitions: 40 and 120 GB respectively. I use the 120GB partition for backing up pictures and documents. The 40GB partition once held Windows XP as the thing's primary OS. Both were set to NTFS.\nOn the Ubuntu setup, I chose \"Something Else\" because I just wanted to wipe out the 40gb partition while still using my 120GB partition as is.\nI had read in a guide to leave some SWAP space available for the OS, preferably the same size as the physical RAM. So I created a 39.4GB partition for the OS (Primary, Beginning, EXT4) and allocated 600MB for the SWAP. The guide I read said that Linux would only take up 4.5GB of hard drive space, so I was pretty happy with that.\nSo, fast forward a little bit. The OS installs just fine. Now here's what gets me. I open up the Terminal and I see my leftover 120GB partition, with all my files still safe and intact. My real problem lies with the primary partition.\nIf Ubuntu supposedly uses up only 4.5GB of hard disk space, I should have 34.9GB free/leftover space in the primary partition. But, I can't find it! Where is it? In Windows, I know you can see how much space is used and your remaining free space in \"Drive C\". How can I find and access that remaining space in Ubuntu?\n\nA: The default graphical tool to analyze disk usage in 12.04 is baobab. You can run it from the Dash by searching for \"Disk usage...\". The utility will scan your entire filesystem of all mounted partitions to give you the available free space:\n\nSo in order to view the capacity and usage of your 40 GB Ubuntu partition you just dont mount your NTFS partition (or unmount if if you had mounted it) before you run baobab.\nYou can further display the disk usage in all directories when choosing \"Scan Filesystem\", or of your HOME directory only. This will then help to discover directories containing huge amounts of data.\n\nFrom the command line (terminal) you can issue the following command:\ndf -a\n\nTo get a list of all mounted filesystems with their respective disk usage in 1k blocks and percent.\nThe reason we do not have such a clear cut disk usage display you may be used to have from Windows is that the Ubuntu file management is very different. For Ubuntu it does not really matter where your data are physically but where they are mounted. See this question for more:\n\n\n*\n\n*What does it mean to mount something?\n\nA: You can use disk Usage Analyzer.  Just type disk in dash, and click on it.\n\nOnce the window opens, you can click on scan folder, and it will give you detailed info of all the space being used.\n\n", "Q: Are there other traditional Chinese zhuyin input other than the default? In 12.04, there is only one traditional Chinese zhuyin input: Chewing\nHowever, Chewing has many features I do not like.\nThe most annoying one is that Chewing randomly drops characters after you type too many characters and fill the \"queue\". For example, Chewing outputs this when I type 1~10 (一二三四五六七八九十) repeatedly many times:\n一四五七十一四五六七八九十一二三四五六七八九十\n^^^^^^^^^^^^^\nexpected:\n一二三四五六七八九十一二三四五六七八九十一二三四五六七八九十  \nChewing drops the characters 二三六八九二三 (2, 3, 6, 8, 9, 2, 3).\nThis is very annoying and obstructive. Are there any other traditional Chinese Zhuyin packages I could try out?\nThank you.\n\nA: ibus-m17n  and ibus-anthy  both provide BoPoMoFo input methods. \nIbus input methods are for both traditional and simplified characters. To switch, you need to show the language panel.\nRight click the Ibus indicator on the menubar >> Choose Preferences. \nIn the Preferences dialog, change the Show language panel setting from the default Embedded in menu to either When active or Always. Close the dialog. (The Embedded in menu option does not always work.)\nThe language panel usually opens in the lower right, but you can drag it around. You will see a toggle button for 简/繁 (simplified/traditional) on the bar. \n", "Q: Many games stuttery - nvidia Many games I play are stuttery, (run at a fine fps, but pause randomly every second or so). This happens both when running a native game such as Amnesia, and a game through wine like LoL or WoW. Occasionally I can stop Amnesia from doing it by restarting it and turning SSAO on and off repeatedly, which is a bit weird. I am using the proprietary Nvidia drivers (nvidia-current, the beta ones aren't compatible with my card). Here is the output from lshw -c video\n *-display               \n       description: VGA compatible controller\n       product: C61 [GeForce 6150SE nForce 430]\n       vendor: NVIDIA Corporation\n       physical id: d\n       bus info: pci@0000:00:0d.0\n       version: a2\n       width: 64 bits\n       clock: 66MHz\n       capabilities: vga_controller bus_master cap_list rom\n       configuration: driver=nvidia latency=0\n       resources: irq:22 memory:fa000000-faffffff memory:e0000000-efffffff memory:f9000000-f9ffffff memory:fbec0000-fbedffff\n\nHow do I fix this issue, or is my GPU just not good enough?\n\nA: This is a complete guess, but in my experience the symptoms you describe may have nothing to do with your video card. I'm referring to your description that the frame-rate is cool, and then suddenly things stutter.\nTo be on the safe side, use system monitor or something similar just to check if your not peaking out your resources (cpu, memory, disk).\nI'm not saying it's not your video card, but just make sure everything else is fine.\nApologies for not being able to give better advice.\n\nA: Try install e17 and login into that when playing games.

When I try to boot the desktop from that same usb, it won't boot from it and I get the same disk read error over and over. \nI've researched this extensively online and the only answers I come up with are to change the boot order, or use f10 to choose what to boot from.

I know both the parted magic dvd and usb work correctly but I can't get them to work on this bleeping computer. \nAny help would be greatly appreciated. \n\nA: It sounds like you might have a corrupt hard drive. Try purchasing an external hard drive adapter and see if the hard drive will pop up for available use. If your hard drive does not become available when using the external hard drive adapter on the other computer you are using to make this process happen, you will know if you do or do not have a damaged hard drive.\nIf it does work, then you will know at least that your hard drive is working properly.\n", "Q: Steam does not create system starters for some games For some games I installed, steam hasn't created system starters.

After you do this, move the shortcut wherever you want.\nIf you want to add the file to a launcher, here's some amazingly well written information on doing it in both Gnome and Unity after you find the executable's location:\nhttps://help.ubuntu.com/community/UnityLaunchersAndDesktopFiles\n\nA: Not sure what games you are having problems with, I have not heard of any that have this problem.\nI installed a game but unselected the \"create system application icon\" and \"create desktop shortcut\" but decided that I wanted a launcher after wards, the way I did it may work for you.  \nFirst thing, in the future make sure that the box to \"create system application icon\" is checked before you install just in case it is being unselected by some Steam bug when installing. This may prevent the problem form happening with future installs. \n\nIf this fails or in your current case there is this question about how to create a system launcher for a program, this may be difficult with Steam as the launch command can be a bit convoluted and not easy to find the correct one, I only include it here so that you can see how you can do it if you ever need to for other programs and for academic value.\nBack to how I created mine after the fact....\n\n\n*\n\n*For the game you are trying to create a launcher for, you will need to right-click on the Game name if using the \"detailed view\" (this is the default) or on the Game Icon if using either the \"list\" or \"grid\" view.\n\n*Select Properties \n\n*Click on the box to create a Desktop Shortcut on the screen shot below my mouse pointer is hovering over it.\n\nThen open a Nautilus(Home Folder) window and then press Ctrl + H to show hidden files then go to the following location;  .local/share/applications  you can then drag the icon from the desktop to the folder.  \nYou should then have the launcher in the dash but you may have to log out and then back in to see it.\nNOTE: this method will only work for your user account not any other accounts on your computer but can be repeated for each account. You could also leave it on your desktop instead of dragging it to the mentioned folder but it will not be shown in your dash.

I just recently installed Ubuntu 12.10 on my desktop, and i've run into more than a few problems along the way.\nFirst, it began with having issues with installing the GRUB bootloaders on a dual boot system, which was fixed. Then, after getting it fully installed, and booting up to find out the nvidia drivers were botched (this, however after many attempts got fixed, was due to kernel images being mix matched with the current state of nvidia-current or something.). After all that, i had felt that Unity was still a bit sluggish, so i tweaked some of the settings using ccsm, and i ticked something i shouldn't have ticked (of course.. :/) thus making me unable to boot up fully and see the taskbar and panels, but only the icons.\nI figured, at this point, i'd might as well try Gnome, after hearing about it allot. I installed Gnome Remix because i liked it better then gnome, and it worked for two days. After, changing my mind again, (not liking the panels in Gnome or Gnome classic), i wanted to fix Unity. after researching for a few minutes, i got Unity back up and running, after reboots even. Now, being 1h ago, after enabling the 'Unity Plugin\" in ccsm, and rebooting, no matter what i use, Gnome, Gnome Classic, Unity, all i get is my background, no icons, no taskbar, and no panels or popups whatsoever.\nI might also add, since the first install, i've gotten a crap-ton of \"System Failed\" or \"Ubuntu 12.10\" issues, which i've reported all i could. \nWhich leads me here, kinda desktop screwed, because i don't want to go back to windows, losing all my transferred items, re-installing due to the same reason, or even the fact that i have very slow internet, so anything over 100mb will take me more than a few hours to download.\nSo, is there any way to un-screw myself from this predicament?

I have flash, which seems to have dead ended at 11.2.  I have the latest chrome 23.xxx.x..x, but neither of those allow me to watch Amazon Instant video.  I can disable pepper, but then the 11.2 on my system is out of date. \nIs there any way I can get Amazon Instant video to work?\n\nA: Amazon fixed the issue. It took their development team a little bit of time, but they made the new viewer backwards compatible to 11.2 for Linux.  I did write them a nasty email about it as well.  If it was free, the time wouldn't be an issue, but amazon prime is a costly service, and they should treat it as such.  It's annoying to be put in the back seat as a linux user, and it's nice to see a quick response time from a company like this.\n\nA: Yes, I was having this same issue lately, after an apparent update. \nI followed this info and it is working great in Linux Mint .\nFollow the Ubuntu ppa addition and this will cause firefox to install sliverlight plugin.\nhttp://thelinuxcauldron.com/2013/08/19/youre-doing-it-right-netflx-playback-on-linux-with-pipelight/\n", "Q: what media won't play? Leaving aside DRM media, are there specific codecs or filetypes which simply won't play on Linux?\nI've installed ubuntu-restricted-extras but didn't get libavcodec-extra-53 for example.  While there's no specific filetype I'm looking for, more of a list of what won't work.\n\nA: In five years I've never run into anything (DRM excluded) that can't play. Some things need restricted codecs, some required VLC... But everything played in the end.\nThat's not to say there aren't rare codecs out there (there are) but unless you're doing pretty niche stuff, you're unlikely to bump into them.\n\nA: If you install a program like VLC, you'll be able to play almost every media format under the sun. The only issues you'll run into is when you want to play DRM protected files or protected DVDs. The latter can be rectified by following the readily available guides all over the net for installing the DVD decryptors(although the legality of installing them varies from country to country).\nWhen it comes to DRM content generally the answer is \"No\" since most DRM systems don't support Linux, but running the Windows Programs required for some DRMs is possible using things like WINE. Netflix support has been dealt with thanks to a nice developer that has designed and pre-built a Wine+Silverlight+Firefox solution for dealing with Netflix's and Lovefilm's DRM. Other services like Amazon and Hulu use Flash DRM which IS officially supported on Linux so no issues there. Reading Adobe protected Epubs is simple enough by installing a slightly older version of Adobe Reader in WINE.\nAs for dealing with other DRMs you'll have to look up online if somebody has found a workaround for that specific DRM Service.\n", "Q: Wifi Does Not Work After System Update I recently installed Ubuntu 12.10 x64 onto a Dell Inspiron 1525. First thing I always do when installing new OSs is being it up to speed to naturally I installed all updates before proceeding further. Now the unit has rebooted and I have no wifi. I plug in an ethernet cable and don't get anything that way either.\nThe Inspiron is using a Broadcom wifi adapter, which I have found is known to cause issues. \nIt also appears I am missing certain features in my build...unless I'm just doing something wrong.  If someone could help me get my wireless adapter working I would be good to go and very greatful\n\nA: This seems to be a somewhat common problem with 12.10 x64. You had wireless while on LiveCD/USB, but after installation not anymore. Recompiling the module for your Broadcom adpater is likely to solve things.\nRun this on wired connection:\nsudo apt-get install linux-headers-generic\nsudo apt-get install --reinstall bcmwl-kernel-source\nsudo modprobe wl\n\nNow it should it be working.\nLastly, set the module to be loaded at boot time. Run this as root:\necho wl >> /etc/modules\n\n\nA: I had the same problem. You need to connect your pc for a short time to a router, afterwards, go to the software centre search for additional drivers, if not installed. Open this program and choose 'Activate'. Wait some time and then, it should work again.\n", "Q: Should I install non-repository software as root or as my user? What is the right way of installing programs that are not available in repositories: should my user own the binaries and keep them in ~/bin/, or should root own the binaries and keep them in, say, /opt/?\nI'm talking about a desktop system, not a server, and normal programs that don't require any special privileges such as starting on boot etc. My concern is for safety. If the binary is owned by root, has mode 755, and it runs as my user, then a virus should not be able to overwrite the binary, as opposed to the case where my user would own the binary, right? I noticed that everything in /usr/bin/ is owned by root and has 755 permissions.\n\nA: To be more specific there are two things to do here. You can \"Run\" a program or \"Install\" it.\nRunning\nRunning a program only requires that the executable file has the \"execute\" permission enabled. Programs run like this, from a normal User, have access to everything the User has read/write access to, which is usually directories like /home, /tmp, and /media/NAMEOFDRIVE.\nSo basically you can run self contained portable programs, scripts, and even build programs using make as long as they don't need to touch any directory owned by Root.\nInstalling\nInstalling a program involves copying it's core components to restricted parts of the OS in order to streamline it's execution and integrate it with other systems and programs. This requires Root permission because it involves writing to directories owned by Root. The reason Root exists is to prevent any rouge programs or scripts from doing critical damage to the OS without getting strict Permission from the User or Administrator.\nGenerally almost every directory in the \"root\"(/) of the filesystem is owned and writable only by Root. The exceptions are /home(where user profiles and data are stored), /tmp(where temporary files are written to in order to be deleted when no longer needed or upon reboot), and usually any folder under /media(but not itself) as this is where things like your USB drives and DVDs are mounted.\nSummary\nBasically, as long as a program or script has no need to write to a directory owned by Root then it shouldn't be run as Root. A Safety feature in Ubuntu(and Linux in General) is to always prompt the user when a program wants to access an area controlled by Root, which means everytime you run something like APT you will be prompted for your password. The only exceptions to this are programs designed to automatically start at boot, but these programs had to first get Root permission from the User before being able to set that up in the first place.\nAlso Ubuntu(and some other Distros) take things a step further with the use of the sudo and gksu tools. Instead of the original practice of giving a program Root access via su and that program then having free use of Root until closed, sudo and gksu only give Root access for a single command, further limiting the possibility of the User accidentally giving the wrong program free rein of Root. \n", "Q: How can I make Compiz work with MATE 1.6?

I have no idea what I'm doing here, at all. I bought a lenovo laptop from a pawn store, and it had Windows 7 with a single locked user account. I'd like to access the current files without resetting the entire system, so I installed Ubuntu to a flash drive and have successfully booted from it (I'm using it now).

This package does not provide a GUI version of Vim or scripting language support. See the other vim-* packages if you need more (or less).\nIn order to install this package, run sudo apt-get install vim\n\n*\n\n*jvim-canna - Japanized VIM (Canna version)\nThis package allows the entering of Kanji from the console.\nIn order to install this package, run sudo apt-get install jvim-canna\nDepends upon the libcanna1g library\nDoes not appear to support Perl, Python, Ruby, or TCL scripting.\n\n*\n\n*vim-athena - enhanced vi editor - compiled with an Athena GUI\nThis package is compiled with the Athena GUI as opposed to GTK+ or Gnome.\nSee this askubuntu answer for additional details.\nIn order to install this package, run sudo apt-get install vim-athena\nSupports Perl, Python, Ruby, and TCL scripting.\n\n\n*vim-gnome/vim-gtk3 - enhanced vi editor - compiled with a GNOME GUI (GTK2 before 17.10, GTK3 from 17.10)\nIn order to install this package, run sudo apt-get install vim-gnome\nDepends upon the libgnome2 library\nSupports Perl, Python, Ruby, and TCL scripting.\n\n\n*vim-gtk - enhanced vi editor - compiled with the GTK2 GUI\nUsed in KDE/Kubuntu-like environments\nIn order to install this package, run sudo apt-get install vim-gtk\nSupports Perl, Python, Ruby, and TCL scripting.\n\n\n*vim-nox - enhanced vi editor\nLike vim-tiny, vim-nox is a minimal vim installation and does not have a GUI. It comes with mouse support, but no clipboard support, IIRC.\nIn order to install this package, run sudo apt-get install vim-nox\nSupports Perl, Python, Ruby, and TCL scripting.\n\n\n*vim-tiny - enhanced vi editor - compact version\nvim-tiny is included as the default vim on Ubuntu distributions and comes with many optional features disabled(e.g. multi-level undo).\nSee this askubuntu answer for details on its feature set(or lack thereof).\nIn order to install this package, run sudo apt-get install vim-tiny\nDoes not support Perl, Python, Ruby, or TCL scripting.\nAs close to being vi without being vi.\n\nLocally, to see which features are supported in a particular installed vim package, running the following command: vim --version will provide a list of features included(or excluded) in the particular package.\nFor example, on my system I can run either vim --version, vim.tiny --version, or vim.athena --version to see the differences in their respective supported features.  The Debian/Ubuntu /etc/alternatives system determines which vim package executes when you runvi or vim, see What is etc/alternatives used for?\n\nPython support\nBefore 16.04, the above packages (other than vim-tiny) included Vim with scripting support for Python 2. In 16.04, they all support Python 3, and there are corresponding *-py2 packages (vim-gnome-py2, for example) which provide a Vim command with Python 2 support. Both can be installed together, and the commands will be, for example, vim.gnome and vim.gnome-py2 respectively.

In Synaptic the closest things I can find are \"glibc-doc 2.15\" and \"eglibc-source 2.15.\" Is it possible to get glibc 2.7 with Synaptic Package Manager/Ubuntu Software Center or do I need to roll my sleeves up? Or are these version numbers (2.15 and 2.7) not referring to the same thing?\n\nA: The short answer is yes. Ubuntu 12.04 is sufficient for Android dev. The package name for glibc in Ubuntu is libc6.

I'm upgrading the system to a 64 bit install, but I have no intention of keeping any files.\nAlso: The installer isn't letting me hit F6 for Other Options on boot of the drive. Is it in there?\n\nA: I will assume when you mention the Installer, you mean the LiveCD or LiveUSB where you have the Ubuntu installer.\nFirst, if the installer is not giving you the option for F6 it could either be that it booted too fast or that it is damaged (The CD or the Image somehow got damaged).\nSecondly, since you do not care about the files or the need to do a backup then I can simply say to boot the computer from within a working LiveCD or LiveUSB, and tell the Ubuntu installer, where it asks what option do you want to choose (Between leaving the current OS intact, removing all partitions and installing it from scratch or doing it manually), to just remove everything.\nAlready tried right now. My scenario was a system with Ubuntu 12.04 32 Bit. I then proceeded to execute a LiveCD of Ubuntu Server 12.10 Server 64 Bit.

I am not sure what in xorg-dev (or its prerequisites) is causing the problem.\n\nA: You don't have to reboot after those commands. Reboot is only required after installing a new kernel, and that does not happen on an upgrade - only on a dist-upgrade.\nFirst, take a snapshot of the virtual machine, while it is running:\n\n\n*\n\n*either click on the camera in the VirtualBox GUI,\n\n*or press the virtual machine window's \"close\" button and then \"Save the machine state\". \nThen, shut down the machine via the Ubuntu interface (not the VirtualBox menus, nor the virtual machine's close button).\nFinally, check whether you can reboot. If you can't, restore the snapshot (click on the icon with the ^ symbol in the VirtualBox GUI) and start the machine.\n", "Q: Shrink extended partition containing lvm I have been bashing my head against the wall, regretting ever having opted into using LVM.\n\nI need to shrink the 75GB /dev/sda2/ to make room for a new OS installation. To do this, I need to shrink the /dev/sd5 partition which is contained in sd2. \nI first attempted to use GParted, but my version says it does not support LVM. I downloaded the latest .iso for GParted Live into a CD, but the results were similar.\nSo I have already taken all the steps to shrink the filesystem, volume group, physical volume, and so on.\nuser@computer:~$ sudo pvs\n  PV         VG     Fmt  Attr PSize  PFree   \n  /dev/sda5  ubuntu lvm2 a-   56.00g 1020.00m\n\n\n\nuser@computer:~$ sudo lvdisplay \n  --- Logical volume ---\n  LV Name                /dev/ubuntu/root\n  VG Name                ubuntu\n  LV UUID                blahblahblah\n  LV Write Access        read/write\n  LV Status              available\n  # open                 0\n  LV Size                55.00 GiB\n  Current LE             14080\n  Segments               1\n  Allocation             inherit\n  Read ahead sectors     auto\n  - currently set to     256\n  Block device           252:0\n\nI have even removed the swap_1 volume. \nWhen I run the latest GParted from the LiveCD, it does show the used 56GB volume group, then some 18GB unallocated space. However, it still does not let me resize /dev/sda5 or /dev/sda2. How can I resize /dev/sda2, given that the volume group and physical volumes are already 55GB, while is 18GB less than the size of the containing extended partition /dev/sd2?\n\nA: Perhaps not the smartest solution:\nuse the tool system-config-lvm to migrate your data to another (temporal, external hard drive) device, delete the partition / do your resizing and migrate the data back.\nhope that helps\n\nA: I fixed this by accidentally deleting the /dev/sd2 extended partition (via 'parted'--I thought, like fdisk, parted would not commit the changes immediately).\nI then used testdisk to look for lost partitions. It found /dev/sd5, and considered it a primary partition. (It did not find the extended partition /dev/sd2). \nAfter this, I was able to use gparted to resize and do operations onto the partitions.\n", "Q: Wubi offline installation error; failed I'd read a guide to install Ubuntu using wubi offlinely, but it's failed.

So I changed every font setting for Simplified Chinese (to test it), but nothing changed in the mail.\nAt this thread the solution (for TB 13) was to change the font settings for Other Languages. But I don't have this option in the list.\n\nA: Possibly you're seeing spam that tries to evade detection with similar-looking letters in faraway Unicode planes, similar to how upside-down text is achieved. Try copy-pasting it inside gedit, which will probably have the same behaviour as Thunderbird (requests a single font but gets a fallback font for rendering unusual characters).\n", "Q: Fans really loud, ubuntu 12.10 I've been trying to get into using Ubuntu 12.10, but it's hard when my PCs fans are nonstop running so loud I get a headache at the very least.\nWhile it was running Windows 7 the fans were mostly quiet. I've tried all these vague guides to using lm-sensors and fancontrol but so far all that has achieved is pwmconfig increasing the speed of one fan to max and then not lowering it until I restart no matter what I blindly attempt.\nAll I want to do is lower the PWM/RPM.\nEDIT: I managed to make just the rear fan slow down drastically. Thankfully it's the largest and loudest fan, so even if I can't get the others to slow it's a decent victory.\n\nA: Did you install the proprietary display driver?\nAs I think, the fans are on fire because the temperature of your video card is bit higher than usual.\nInstalling the display driver provided by Nvidia should fix the problem.\nRun this command in Terminal:\n\nsudo apt-get update\n  sudo apt-get install nvidia-current\n\n", "Q: USSD command sender to 3G Modem Does anybody know any software with GUI interface for sending USSD commands to 3G Modems?\nI have found only this but it uses xml file and you need to store commands in xml file before sending. \nThank you in advance.\n\nA: It is Modem Manager. It can be installed by\nsudo apt-get install modem-manager-gui\n\n\nA: Well, if you want to check your balance or top up on a SIM-Card, there is the Prepaid-manager-applet. It has a nice graphical interface and is in the official repositories: \nIf your provider is not already listed, you can add the USSD-number to '/usr/share/mobile-broadband-provider-info/serviceproviders.xml'. Find the section of your country and provider and add\n    <balance-check>\n        <ussd>*102#</ussd>\n    </balance-check>\n\nwhereas *102# has to be replaced by your providers USSD-code.\nIf you also want to top up your phone with this applet, you also need to add\n    <balance-top-up>\n        <ussd replacement=\"CODE\">*130*CODE#</ussd>\n    </balance-top-up>\n\nAnd secondly you can also send USSD commands via gammu. Install wammu for a graphical interface. The configuration of gammu will be more complicated but it offers a lot more functionality -- you can send USSD commands of any kind, not just for balance-check. \n", "Q: How to get online Movie Rental Service to Work I turned to Ubuntu 12.10 (and then Mint...and then back) as a means for giving one last leg to an old PC. I'm thrifty, and thought Ubuntu's UI was very attractive. As it stands, I love how Ubuntu functions, I love how it looks, and I'm pretty sure I could become a pretty loyal user...but.\nI'm having one hell of a time getting any online movie rental service to work. I'd rather avoid any torrent options, so the services I've attempted to use include:\n\n\n*\n\n*Amazon Instant Video\n\n*Vudu\n\n*Blockbuster's Service (Cinema...something)\n\n*Google Play\n\n*iTunes (via Wine/PlayOnLinux)\n\n\nFrom what I can tell, the only common thread with these services is DRM. Here's what I've attempted to make these work:\n\n\n*\n\n*http://www.techdrivein.com/2012/10/20-things-to-do-after-installing-ubuntu1210-quantal-quetzal.html Everything here.\n\n*I've attempted the various \"hal\" suggestions out there, including the ones on this thread: Adobe flash player not working with Amazon Prime\n\n*I've tried using Safari via Wine and winetricks to install Flash: http://techzil.com/install-safari-on-ubuntu/\n\n*I've tried different variants of Google Chrome. Chromium, Chrome, Chrome Beta, and Chrome on Wine. I've taken what steps I can to disable \"pepper\" from it.\n\n\nHere's what happens when I currently try to use the various services:\n\n\n*\n\n*Amazon: Player loads (Green progress dots...looks fine); Then I receive a Play Update prompt that says \"An error occurred and your player could not be updated. This is likely because your Flash Player or Browser needs to be updated.This update is required to play back the video.\"\n\n*Vudu: The player loads, then I'm given an endless buffering status. Sometimes the buffering status drops off, but the video never loads.\n\n*Blockbuster thing: The player gets hung up on loading a video.\n\n*Google Play: Static and \"Please Upgrade Flash to Watch this Video\"\n\n*Can't get any version of iTunes to install correctly through Wine.\n\n\nI just want one of these services to work, I really don't care which one. Ubuntu will never be able to become my primary OS if I can't rent a movie on it from time to time...which I think would be a shame. So hopefully there's one of you brilliant Ubuntu-ers (what do you call yourselves, anyway?) who can figure this out.\nIf you need system specs, error logs, or whatever, just ask (but you might have to tell me how to pull them). I've gotten fairly comfortable with punching in various Terminal commands, though I don't know what I'm doing most of the time.\nAs an aside, please don't recommend any of the subscription services at this time (Netflix, Redbox Instant, Hulu---Hulu does play video for me btw). I may turn to those at a later date, but I prefer to rent movies on the fly at random. Now that I think about it, just in case it helps you, I can get video to play from:\n\n\n*\n\n*Hulu\n\n*YouTube\n\n*ABC\n\n\nAnd I haven't tried any others beyond that...\n\nA: Manual creation of some directories and such have to be done with HAL as outlined in these answers.  \nIs there a work around to get protected Hulu or Amazon Prime instant videos working?\np.s. i run CentOS 6 and it was fixed on its own by Amazon within a week.\n\nA: Try Using Chrome. It has full flash support, which should help with both google play and Amazon. iTunes doesn't really run well in wine, if it runs at all. http://appdb.winehq.org/objectManager.php?sClass=application&iId=1347 .\nI'm not sure what Vudu and Blockbuster use, But as long as they use flash Chrome is your best bet.\nAlso, make sure you install the newest versions of icedtea Java (6 and 7) From the Ubuntu Software Center.\n\nA: Get a copy of Android and install it in a Virtualbox VM.

But everything is too small with this resolution. Icons, Unity, file system, browsers etc. For example in Chrome only when I set the zoom to 150% sites view normal. When I use the 16:9 resolution 1360x768 the size problem is fixed, but in this mode the display colours and view are blurry and thick, so it harms the eyes. And as my display supports 1920x1080, I think that I better keep this native resolution and fix size problem instead.\nsome Screenshots: Screenshots 1, Screenshots 2\nHow can I solve this and get the desktop displayed in an acceptable size? \n\nA: Starting with 14.04 we have an option that helps a bit:\nScaling Support\nopen the System Settings (here in english:)\nLANG=c unity-control-center\n\nGo to \"Displays\" and set the \"Scale for menu and title bars\":\n\nTo adjust Firefox, open a new tab about:config in Firefox and search for layout.css.devPixelsPerPx set this value to 2 to adjust the size of the Firefox icons - The same with Thunderbird\nsee also: \n\n\n*\n\n*How to find and change the screen DPI?\n\n*Adjust Firefox to a High DPI display (retina)\n\n*Fix scaling of java-based applications for a high DPI screen\n\nA: Open dconf-editor and goto /org/gnome/desktop/interface/text-scaling-factor and adjust the scaling. Calculate the scaling by 1920/screen width in inches/96, assuming that you display is set to 96dpi now (check with xdpyinfo | grep dots).\nYou can play a bit with he scaling factor to get to a size you like.\nNote: This only changes fonts and some UI elements but not the browser contents. To do this you need to run all of X11 with a higher dpi setting of around 160. This can be done by adding \nxrandr --dpi 160\n\nto your ~.xprofile.\n\nA: EDIT: Ubuntu 14.04 sort of supports high resolution screens and allows you to scale the panel and launcher with a simple slider under System Settings -> Displays. It's still a bit buggy: it doesn't work for some apps like Spotify doesn't scale and Thunderbird don't scale icons and the content of the emails. \nSo while Ubuntu took a giant leap forward, the below solution is still the only fully functioning way of scaling everything on Ubuntu.\n\nYou can scale everything with xrandr but the result is not as pretty as it could be if there was true high resolution support.\nTo scale your resolution, first find the name of your display with xrandr:\nlars:~$ xrandr\nScreen 0: minimum 320 x 200, current 1366 x 768, maximum 1600 x 1600\nLVDS connected 1366x768+0+0 (normal left inverted right x axis y axis) 344mm x 194mm\n   1366x768       60.0*+\n   1280x768       60.0 +\n   1280x720       60.0 +\n   1024x768       60.0 +\n   1024x600       60.0 +\n   800x600        60.0 +\n   800x480        60.0 +\n   720x480        60.0 +\n   640x480        60.0 +\nDFP1 disconnected (normal left inverted right x axis y axis)\nCRT1 disconnected (normal left inverted right x axis y axis)\n\nSo, in my case my laptop display is called LVDS.\nThen run the following to scale your resolution:\nxrandr --output LVDS --scale 0.75x0.75\n\nThe Launcher and Panel might disappear for a moment, but just hover your cursor over them and they should reappear. You might also have to resize any open windows so that they fit the smaller resolution.\nI wish there was true high resolution support that was this easy to configure. Sadly even GNOME 3.10 seems to only support changing the font size, even though GNOME handles that a lot better than Unity.\n\nA: I think this is a problem that hasn't been addressed, yet. The retina display on some Apple computers has a resolution of 2880 x 1800. (Take a look at how ubuntu looks on one of these.) That's only any good if the icons etc. are actually displayed at a higher resolution as well.\nFor the moment, you can halve your resolution and get something of a decent size or use your ubuntu with a magnifying glass...\nAs more and more high-resolution displays hit the market, I figure that ubuntu will have a solution for this fairly soon, though.\n\nA: I had the same problem with my Vaio SVZ13114GXX. Give Unity Tweak Tool a try, I tested many different combinations from Appearance and ended up with changing font size from 11 to 13, and setting hinting to full.

Are there any BIOS settings I can look at that might help?\nNote: Legacy USB support is enabled.  I have tried different mice and keyboards. When I get to the screen that allows me to either Try or Install Ubuntu, the keyboard works fine. A PS2 mouse works.\n\nA: I found the solution to this issue. The trick is to enable (at least on Gigabyte Motherboards like the 970a series) IOMMU in the peripherials tab. It is ab option with no description close to the bottom of the menu. Only 2 options, enable or disable. Enable the option save the setting and reboot. Surprise! All of you USB devices are now functional again. More about IOMMU here\n\nA: The answer really was to replace the motherboard/CPU.  Maybe it was the combination of the two models I bought.  I replaced them with an Intel i5 and an MSI motherboard. Everything worked out of the box.\n", "Q: Skype sound not working and crashes while in call I am using Ubuntu 12.10 but this same problem happened when I was running 12.04.\nWhenever I call someone or I get called and pick up, I hear nothing and they cant hear me.

I would like to use a tool like deja-dup or similar to have backups of certain directories in a virtualbox Ubuntu 12.04 machine that runs on a Windows 7 host laptop. I am plugging and unplugging this laptop quite often during the day, so ideally this system would be able to auto-mount the USB disk and would not break if I unplug it midway of a backup operation.

I have many servers and they all end with the same servers.company.net, so for example vded-xx-001.servers.company.net, and was wondering if it is possible to make it so i can just type the vded-xx-001 and have it append the servers.company.net automatically ?\nSo i would want to type \nssh user@vded-xx-001\n\nand have it actually connect to\nssh user@vded-xx-001.servers.company.net\n\nI have tried setting my DNS-search domain to servers.company.net, in /etc/network/interfaces, but this did not achieve the desired outcome.\nAnyone able to point me in the right direction ?\nThanks in advance \n\nA: This is the easiest solution. It works for all hosts, does not require root or access to any DNS/resolver systems.\nAdd to the top of your ~/.ssh/config file (or create if it doesn't already exist):\nCanonicalizeHostname yes\nCanonicalDomains servers.company.net\n\nDocumentation (man 5 ssh_config):\n\nCanonicalizeHostname\nControls whether explicit hostname canonicalization is performed. The default, no, is not to perform any name rewriting and let the system resolver handle all hostname lookups. If set to yes then, for connections that do not use a ProxyCommand, ssh will attempt to canonicalize the hostname specified on the command line using the CanonicalDomains suffixes and CanonicalizePermittedCNAMEs rules. If CanonicalizeHostname is set to always, then canonicalization is applied to proxied connections too.\nIf this option is enabled, then the configuration files are processed again using the new target name to pick up any new configuration in matching Host and Match stanzas.\n\n\nA: Probably you already solved this, but maybe later it could help someone: you don't need to mess with your resolv.conf, just can use something like this in your ~/.ssh/config:\nHost vded-*-001 test-*-something-fixed-*\n        HostName %h.servers.company.net\n        User someusername\n\nSo later you can just use:\nssh vded-alotofstuff-001\nssh vded-somethingels-001\nssh test-02-something-fixed-somethingelse\n\n\nA: Yes, you can do this by creating a config file named ~/.ssh/config and entering the following contents:\nHost vded-xx-001\nUser user\nPort 22\nHostName vded-xx-001.servers.company.net\n\nNow you just have to type this (you don't even need the username any more):\n$ ssh vded-xx-001\n\nThis also works with the command-line utility scp:\n$ scp filename vded-xx-001:/path/\n\n\nA: The solution to my problem was to add the search domain to resolv.conf:\nsearch servers.company.net\n\nThis has allowed me to enter\nssh user@vded-xx-001\n\nfor any of my servers and it connect to the correct address.\nThank you @Hennes for the answer\n\nA: If you're using SSH identities - and with that many servers it's worth looking at - then as OrangeDog said setting CanonicaliseHostname and CanonicaliseDomains will also enable a match to a @cert-authority entry in your known hosts\nknown_hosts entry\n@cert-authority *.example.com ssh-rsa AAAddadfkjaeio...\nwithout Canonicalise options you'd need to use \"ssh host.example.com\"\nWith Canonicalise options \"ssh myhost\" will match.\nI'd have added this as a comment to OrangeDogs answer if rep permitted...\n\nA: For a quick solution that works across different programs, you can also set the domain vded-xx-001 to redirect to a specific IP address, by editing /etc/hosts to include a line like this:\n173.194.41.90  vded-xx-001\n\nThis works in your browser:  http://vded-xx-001/\nAs well as with command-line utilities like SSH:\n$ ssh user@vded-xx-001\n\n(I personally prefer the SSH config solution though.)\n\nA: For system-wide domain name resolution, I like to set things one time in my network. So I'd set in the DHCP Server the domain name and DNS Server so that it gives all machines the right resolv.conf including \n\n\n*\n\n*Primary DNS Server IP \n\n*Domain\n\n*search directive\n\n\nThis depends on the DHCP Server and the network config you want...

The problem is that I can't get any wireless extensions when running iwconfig. How can I manage to connect Ubuntu to my wifi card?\n\nA: VirtualBox does not natively offer Wireless support (Like a virtualized Wireless device). Instead, it connects directly to the Wireless device the Host uses. In this guide I will point to the steps needed to have a working Wireless card for you Guest. Before we begin you need to make sure you have done the following points:\n\n\n*\n\n*Installed the Extension Pack for that particular VirtualBox Version. You can find the extension pack in the Download section of VirtualBox. To install it, open VirtualBox, go to the menu and select File --> Preferences. Now select Extensions and select the Add Pack button at the far right. Look for the downloaded Extension pack and add it to VirtualBox.  \n\n*You have added your user to the vboxusers group. The quickest way is to go to the terminal and type: \nsudo usermod -a -G vboxusers cyrex\nwhere cyrex is my username. In this case, you would change cyrex for yours. Note that if the vboxusers group is not found it is because VirtualBox is not yet installed on your system.\nNow to proceed with the steps. This is what is called a passthrough method:\n\n\n*\n\n*Right click on the Virtual Environment you wish to edit and select **Settings*:\n\n\n*Go to the Network section and select an Adapter. In this case I selected Adapter 1 although it is recommended to select a second Adapter, this way, you can use the wireless connection to your Host and still be able to connect to your internal Virtualized network (Connect to other virtualbox guests internally). For the example mentioned here I connected directly using the first adapter.\nClick on the Attached To option and select Bridged Adapter. This will open an option that will show your Host network interfaces. If your host iw Linux it will show something like wlan0, wlan, eth2... If your Host is a Mac, it will show AirPort. In the image you can see wlan0 for this case:\n\nNow simply accept and run your virtualized environment. You should connect and see it similar to this:\n\nI should mention the following:\nOn Mac and Linux hosts, functionality is limited when using AirPort (the Mac's wireless networking) or any Wireless Linux device to bridged networking. Currently, VirtualBox supports only IPv4 over Mac's AirPort or Linux Wireless devices. For protocols such as IPv6 and IPX, you must choose a wired interface.\nSome adapters strip VLAN tags in hardware. This does not allow to use VLAN trunking between VM and the external network with pre-2.6.27 Linux kernels nor with host operating systems other than Linux.\nI should also mention that in the following extended options:\n\nYou can select how you wish to interpret the Host's wireless device. If you wish to see it as a Intel network device, a PcNet device or a Paravirtualized Network device. Note that Promiscuous mode is used more often for sniffing and can create a bit of network lag on both, the Guest and Host when using it.\nNote that if you disconnect in the Guest OS, you are only disconnecting the Guest to Host virtualized connection. You are not disconnecting or turning off your Host's Wireless device. For more information regarding VirtualBox and networking see this guide.\nUsing the method above, with a PCI Wireless device on the host or a USB Wireless device is the same. The VirtualBox Network settings will detect the device the same way. I am testing this right now with the Edimax EW-7811Un. It was detected as wlan1 and Virtualbox (On the Network settings) detected the device as such. Remember that one thing is how the \"outside\" of the virtual environment works and then another how it works inside. Inside it was shown as a \"Wired\" device and I have internet through it.\nNow, if you want to access a USB device do the following (Note that you need the Extension Pack for this):\n\n\n*\n\n*Once the virtual OS has started select the device from the USB option on the bottom:\n\n\n*It will appear on the Desktop after a couple of seconds:\n\n\n*If you want the USB device to be present from the beginning, then go to the USB Settings option and select the Enable USB 2.0 Controller then add the device you wish to have activated with the Add Filter From Device option at the right (The one with the Green Plus sign).\n\nNow I want to add that the difference between the VirtualBox Extension Pack and the Guest Addition is that, apart from the USB support and Remote Display options that the Extension Pack brings the Guest Addition provides the following:\n\n\n*\n\n*Better Mouse Integration\n\n*Better 3D Support\n\n*Copy/Paste Support between Host and Guest\n\n*Folder Sharing between Host and Guest\n\n\nSo if you need any of this features, you need to also install the Guest Addition. If you only need access to a USB Device or network options, with the Extension alone you will have that.\nNote that VirtualBox does NOT provide a virtualized Wireless device inside the guest. They will all look like a wired one, even if the host is providing the connection via a Wired or Wireless card. Something like this:\n\n\nA: If you want to use the connection as wifi in the guest, you need to use the passthrough method as said in the comments but if you only want to connect your guest, you don't need to do that.\nAssuming your wifi connection works on the host system, you can simply in virtualbox manager on the host go to network configuration of your guest. On adaptor 1 tab, select bridge mode and on Name field, you select the wifi connection on your host. The connection will appear as wired connection eth0 on your guest and will work as if it were a wired connection. The wifi part will be managed by the host OS.\n", "Q: Installing Ubuntu 12.10 on my HP-Pavilion G6 Issues I've recently bought a HP Pavilion G6 preloaded with Windows 8.

Is it possible to use a 1600x900 screen resolution in Ubuntu 12.10?\n\nA: Yes, in general it's possible, given that your graphics card and screen support it. \nPrerequisite is of course that you are using a suitable graphics driver. Ubuntu detects most cards just out of the box, yet for some you might need to install the proprietary drivers you can find in the \"Additional Drivers\" entry of the settings manager. \nThat being said, there are some exceptions to the rule. Mostly this applies to old (usually built in the early 1990s) monitors that do not report correct EDID information, for which one has to add the corresponding mode lines by hand to xorg.conf. Also, there exist a few exotic graphics chips which are not supported well by Ubuntu (the Intel GMA 500 and GMA 950 are infamous candidates) which might require more work to get them running.\nSo, if installing the proprietary drivers for your graphics chip does not solve your issue, or there exists no proprietary driver for your graphics card, please report back with more details about your computer, mainly which graphics chip you are using and how your monitor is connected to it.\n\nA: It is not the operating system or Ubuntu limiting the possible screen resolutions but likely your graphics card, or your monitor.

You can you the LiveCD or a LiveUSB stick:\nhttp://www.ubuntu.com/download/help/create-a-usb-stick-on-windows\nBasically, just download the ISO file from Canonical for your architecture and follow the instructions from the given link.\nAs for actually installing Ubuntu, I do not recommend the Windows install feature. You should use a virtual machine (like VirtualBox which is free) to host Ubuntu.\nThe previous solutions are very simple and very good. However, they will always be slower than normal. First because reading from a USB stick or a CD is a lot slower than reading from a hard drive. Second, because you are emulating an operating system on top of another operating system.\nIf you truly want to take the full benefit of using Ubuntu, you should install it alongside Windows, there is no question about it.\nHow to do so properly? Well, it's easy:\n\n*\n\n*Backup your Windows stuff. Just in case you mess up.\n\n*Create a LiveCD or LiveUSB of Ubuntu and run it.\n\n*Use the GParted program in the Live version and:\n\n*\n\n*Shrink one of your partitions to create space for an Ubuntu Partition. You can shrink the Windows partition or any other, just make sure you have like 10GB free.\n\n*Shrink another partition to have enough free space for the \"swap\" partition. This partition should have the same size as your RAM. In my ASUS computer I have 3GB of RAM, so my swap partition is 3GB.\n\n\n*Once these 2 partitions are created you can install Ubuntu. You should choose the advanced mode of installation to make sure the system uses the partitions you created. The Ubuntu Partition should be ext4 and should be \"/\" (root) while the swap partition doesn't really matter.\n\n*Restart and enjoy!\n\nNote: You can also shrink and increase partitions using Windows:\nhttp://www.howtogeek.com/howto/windows-vista/resize-a-partition-for-free-in-windows-vista/\nNote 2: You don't actually have to create 2 partitions. IIRC, if you shrink a partition without doing anything else the installer will detect it and will try to use it for Ubuntu, while making all the configurations automatically (easy install mode). I am however shaky with the easy install (haven't used in a long time) so could anyone confirm? xD\nI just prefer GParted because it is a more powerful tool.\nIf you have problems with your boot (if you can't boot) I strongly suggest using Boot repair! (seriously, it does wonders)\nand if you want to make full backup of your disks / partitions, I suggest using clonezilla!\n", "Q: Will I get desktop Ubuntu after connecting Samsung Galaxy Nexus to TV via HDMI?

Am I safe if I am not using Windows 8?\nAlso, I built the computer myself, it was not a computer pre-built with Windows 8.\n\nA: The last I heard, WUBI was not compatible with EFI-mode booting. Thus, if your Windows is installed in EFI mode, you should not attempt a WUBI install, since it will be a waste of time at best.\nThat said, just because a motherboard supports EFI doesn't mean that it's necessarily booting using EFI. If you install Windows in BIOS/CSM/legacy mode, you should be able to use WUBI. You can check your Windows boot mode by examining the partition table: If it uses the older Master Boot Record (MBR) system, Windows is installed in BIOS mode; if it uses the newer GUID Partition Table (GPT) system, Windows is installed in EFI mode.\nYou can install Linux side-by-side with Windows in a traditional non-WUBI way in either BIOS or EFI mode, so as a general rule, that's the safest way to proceed. If you're building the computer from scratch, that's likely to be the better way to go; WUBI is best used if you're not certain you want to keep Linux and if you don't want to bother repartitioning. You should learn about BIOS vs. EFI boot modes in Linux to ensure you install Linux in a compatible way. One quick check is to open a Terminal or switch to a text-mode console and look for the directory /sys/firmware/efi. If it's present, you've booted Linux in EFI mode, and the installation program will attempt an EFI-mode installation. If that directory is absent, you've probably booted in BIOS mode and the installer will attempt a BIOS-mode installation.\n\nA: There are wubi installers for UEFI systems. I am currently running a 16.04 installation with Windows 10. \nWhat these installers do is dump grub into an EFI partition (E: as described on my computer) which is addressable from the UEFI firmware, and boots and mounts the disk images on your Windows partition.\nhttps://github.com/hakuna-m/wubiuefi/wiki\nFirst, download the iso, and then run the installer in the same directory as the iso.\nHope this helps.\nps: as with all wubi installations there are inherent weaknesses in wubi which make it generally undesirable. Fortunately, I'm lazy and don't care, although I should.\n", "Q: No internet connection behind enterprise proxy Even though I can install stuff via apt-get install, I can't ping anything outside local network or access any site.\nMy wired network adapter is connected in Bridge mode and got an ip via dhcp already.\nI've already configured my proxy settings as follows:\n$ cat /etc/environment \nhttp_proxy=\"http://myproxy:8080/\"\nhttps_proxy=\"https://myproxy:8080/\"\nftp_proxy=\"ftp://myproxy:8080/\"\n\nHost: Windows 7 x64\nGuest: Ubuntu 12.10 32bits\n\nA: Answering my own question here...\nAfter configuring my proxy settings on the chromium settings Change settings proxy... it worked.\n", "Q: Installing Ubuntu after formatting a laptop (Win8 pre-installed) with Uefi/Legacy boot Here is what I got:\nA pre-installed Windows 8 64 bit pro laptop, with an SSD card (Samsung PM83) and a SATA HDD. It is a Vostro 3560 from Dell.\nFirst thing I did was create a recovery disk for Windows 8 and get an image so I can burn a clean install disk for Windows 8. Afterwards, I tried to install Ubuntu.\nAfter setting BIOS to legacy mode, setting secure boot to off, I went on with th Ubuntu LiveCD. I tried to get a partition on the SSD card for / and for swap, but it had some issues with putting swap on that disk.So I tried the default installation on the SSD card. It starts nice, it says it is Copying files, but almost halfway through it shows the installer crashed due to a ErrNo5, I/O error.\nEvery single setting I change (using different file system or UEFI boot mode) results in the same error.\nHas any had this before as well? Were you able to fix it?\nKind regards.\n\nA: An I/O error during installation reeks of a hardware problem. You might want to try doing a SMART test on the disk, reseat or replace cables, etc.\nAs a side note, if you want to set up a dual-boot Windows/Linux configuration, you should not install Linux in BIOS/CSM/legacy mode. With Windows 8 pre-installed, it's almost certainly in EFI mode, and switching boot modes is awkward with most computers. Instead, install Linux in EFI mode, which is likely to be easier to get working.\n\nA: How did you create the partitions? \nWhen I tried to create partitions in my Samsung 840 Pro SSD using Windows I also had problems, so I booted the LiveCD and used GParted instead which worked great.\nAs far as installing Ubuntu on SSD goes, I have a clean Ubuntu 12.10 installation on the SSD disk I previously mentioned, but there is one catch: I have no swap partition. \nWhy no swap partition (you may ask), is this man insane? Well, I figured that with 8GB of RAM in my machine, I don't need swap. I never reached the 8GB limit, and I don't think I will in the nearby future. \nIf your computer also has a lot of RAM, you may want to consider this solution. If not, you could try and create the swap partition in your HDD instead of creating it in the SSD.\nWish I could be more helpful, this is all I got :s\nEDIT: Looks like some Samsung devices are bugged!. I don't know but this may be your case.\n", "Q: Why can't Xubuntu 12.04.2 connect to my hidden WPA/WPA2 personal protected wifi network? I can connect to wi-fi networks that don't have any security without an issue, but when I try to connect to my home wi-fi, I cannot connect.\nAfter a failed attempt to connect, I notice that my computer can see my wi-fi, and it shows that a good signal can be seen, but I still can't connect. All attempts fail in Ubuntu\nI can connect properly and have no issues in Win 8.\nThe wi-fi is a hidden SSID that is WPA/WPA2 Personal protected.\nThe driver I am using is the Broadcom 802.11 STA Wireless driver, and the wi-fi receiver is a BCM4313 802.11b/g/n Wireless LAN Controller.\n\nA: It's been a long while since I took my PC networking classes (and I'm no expert), but it sounds odd that your computer sees a hidden network.

I am thinking about using two SSDs. Install each OS on one SSD. Then set the boot order to the Ubuntu one first. Then, is it possible to boot Windows from Ubuntu? This should be simple right?\nI will want it to always go to Ubuntu first, it only takes like 5 seconds for it to load anyways :)\n\nA: I know you can run some Windows programs from Ubuntu using Wine. If you want to run the Windows operating system, however, I think you would have to use GRUB unless you want to run it virtually. Luckily, if you install Windows first and then install Ubuntu, Ubuntu will be the first option on the GRUB menu followed by safe mode and the recovery console and then Windows. So, if no key is pressed on boot up, Ubuntu will be your active operating system.\n\nA: A good option is to use virtualization environment.\nYou can install virtual box and then install windows os.\n\nA: If you have an SSD with Windows installed, you can add the drive it to /etc/default/grub, and run sudo update-grub.\nThere are plenty of tutorials on how to add windows specifically.\nAlso, you have 2 OS's on each SSD, right? Ubuntu should auto-detect Windows and by running sudo update-grub should add it to the list.\nPersonally I would just choose at startup (from BIOS).\n", "Q: Windows 7 not showing in OS selection menu at start up I have 4 partitions (C:, D:, E: & F:) on my 500GB HHD.\nI have two OS installed on my PC, Windows XP on drive C: and Windows 7 on drive D:.\nToday I did a fresh install of Ubuntu 11.10 on drive C: and install all the necessary drivers but when I restart my computer there was no option in the OS selection menu to boot Windows 7.\nI want to boot Windows 7 as soon as possible, how can I do this? \n\nA: As GRUB can't detect your Windows system, the best way to solve this is to create a manual entry to Windows.\nEdit /etc/grub.d/40_custom (you will need root permission) and add the following at the end:\nmenuentry \"Windows 7\" {\n    insmod part_msdos\n    set root=\"(hd0,msdosN)\"\n    chainloader +1\n}\n\nyou will have to replace \"N\" with the correct windows partition where you have Windows 7 (if you don't know which one it is you can use gparted or if it is available, \"Disc Utility\"). So if your Windows partition is /dev/sda3 the correct text would be\nset root=\"(hd0,msdos3)\"\n\nAfter that just run sudo update-grub2 and you should have a new entry once you reboot.\n", "Q: 13.04 Eee PC keyboard issue I've just installed Ubuntu 13.04 on my ASUS Eee PC 1225B E450 and keyboard is not working although everything was fine in Ubuntu 12.10.\nDoes anyone have any idea how to solve this problem?\nJust discovered next problem: touchpad isn't working too.

About a week ago I started trying to install some games that I bought on Humble Bundle that I downloaded at home and other PCs (my internet is a piece of crap, so it's easier by Torrent), and some of them were .deb files.\nWhen I tried to install those, some would try to install and then go back, like nothing happened (probably because of an internal error), or asked for dependencies that I couldn't find. Because of those problems, I tried to install the same packages using the Terminal (using sudo dpkg -i <package name>), but after a while a red balloon icon appeared on the Menu Bar with an error on a file that contained repositories (don't remember the exact error, sorry. But I think it was that it was invalid and it couldn't write it). \nI left it to fix later, but after a while the Software Center started giving broken package error and asked to repair it, so I opened the Terminal and did apt-get install -f, like I did when that happened before. It asked me to download 888 Kb of packages and I allowed it, but then, shortly after, it started removing everything on the system on its on. It uninstalled the interface, the network driver, a lot of programs, and so on.\nWhen I noticed it, I quickly closed it but it was too late. The Network Connection menu was gone (and probably the driver), so I couldn't use the internet. Seeing that there was nothing I could do on my own, I rebooted to see if it was temporary, but now the system boots without a graphical interface (it only shows tty).\nI have a 3G internet (slow as hell), and I don't know how to connect it using only the terminal, so it is a lot more difficult to fix it. So, is it possible to fix it without reinstalling (PLEEEASE, DON'T MAKE ME REINSTALL THAT WITH THIS CRAPPY CONNECTION)?, and I have the Live USB here if necessary.\nOh, and I forgot to give important information. I am using Ubuntu 12.10 AMDx64, installed on a 101GB ext4 partition. There were only 58MB (approximately) of updates waiting to be done (so it was updated, mostly).\n\nA: Probably you have installed some deb which conflicted with some package that probably was required for some of the applications you mentioned, so they were removed.\nIf you are using 12.04, I some time ago have seen a bug that may be related to what happened to you (apt-get removed some packages when asked to install 32bit libs, if i'm not wrong).\nEither way you should be able to recover, but you will need an internet connection and you may need to download some packages.\nTo connect your 3G device see if this helps. You may also need to edit /etc/resolv.conf with your DNS information. Also there is a small tool called sakis3g that may help you.\nAfter you are connected to the internet, try\nsudo apt-get install ubuntu-desktop\n\nThis should install everything that is in a default Ubuntu installation. Note that probably you will need to uninstall whatever caused the conflict.\nIf it doesn't work you can use dpkg --get-selections to get a listing of the installed/removed packages, and from there install them manually (ie, one by one).\n\nTip: next time you need to check whatever apt-get will do, add --dry-run to the command: it will only simulate the execution, and will not modify the system. Example:\n$ sudo apt-get remove tasksel --dry-run\nReading package lists... Done\nBuilding dependency tree       \nReading state information...

There are a few features I miss from my touchpad under windows. I will list some of them here:\n1.) Circular scrolling: continuous scroll for BOTH vertical and horizontal scrolling that KEEPS moving only up or only down with any given direction or rotation of the finger (not the thing where if you were scrolling down and continuing the stroke with a rotation that it scrolls up when your finger starts moving up, or down when your finger starts moving down) \n2.) The ability to have one finger on the bottom of the touchpad (making contact) for clicking and another on the upper part for general movements\n3.) Windows' added precision option\nPlease note that I have tried manipulating gsynaptics-device-settings and I have attempted to modify the xorg.conf (and screwed a bunch of stuff up on the way).\nIs there any way to gain some of these features back? Or will I have to disobey Synaptics' user agreement and try to reverse engineer the driver they have for Linux (and most likely lose hair and spend a lot of time crying, ultimately leading to failure)?\n\nA: In Synaptics' terminology, \"generic driver\" means \"a driver made by Synaptics that has not been customized by an equipment manufacturer.\"\nThe xf86-input-synaptics driver is not generic, it's Free Software. It was created by many volunteers and paid employees of open source companies like Red Hat and Canonical. As far as I know, Synaptics never contributed anything to it, code or otherwise. It is actually superior to the proprietary driver in several ways, but you'd have to do some reading and tinker with some settings to gain an understanding of what it can do. That's generally true of most Free Software.\nSynaptics, Inc. actually does make a proprietary Linux driver with all the features you mentioned, but it's strictly available to equipment manufacturers for preinstallation on new machines that ship with Linux already installed. You can't find that driver online. Can't even buy it -- license restrictions. That's UN-Free software.\nThe circular scrolling feature you're talking about is called ChiralMotion(TM). I know, it's awesome, I love it too. Really missing it. Unfortunately, it's patented.\nThere is a \"Circular Scrolling\" feature in the open source driver, but it works differently. The circling movement must be centered to the touchpad. Not quite as intuitive, IMHO. Less efficient. It also currently doesn't support horizontal scrolling.\nWell, I wanted that feature back too, so I'm working on some improvements:\nhttp://galundin.github.io/circular-scrolling-improved/\nNo reverse engineering, this is very different from the patented algorithm, even though its behavior is very similar. I'm in the process of hacking this functionality into the open source driver. That's what Free Software is all about. We have the power to make it better.\nSo regarding 1.) hang in there, I'm working on it.\nBased on what you described in 2.) that sounds like you're talking about a Buttonless TouchPad (aka ClickPad). That mode is enabled with the ClickPad option, and SoftButtonAreas to define the boundaries. You can read all about those options and how to configure them here.\nRegarding 3.) \"added precision,\" I think you mean Pointing Enhancements > Slow Motion, which reduces sensitivity while a modifier key is held down (shift or control). That exact feature isn't in the xf86 driver, but it does provide dynamic control of pointer sensitivity in response to finger pressure, which is arguably more intuitive. Type man synaptics in a terminal and look for PressureMotion. That option has several settings to let you fine-tune its behavior. You can change those settings on the fly with the synclient command before you put them into the config file.\nBTW, GSynaptics is deprecated. Its successor is GPointingDeviceSettings. But there are still many options it doesn't show.\n\nA: What I did was reload the repositories in my package manager.  That made three new versions of the touchpad driver appear.  I then installed one of the new Synaptics driver packages, and then restarted my computer.  If you can't find what you need on the Main server, you should try downloading from the United States Server.\nHere's what I did:\n\n\n*\n\n*Open your Synaptics Package Manager and type in your administrative password.  If you don't have the Synaptics Package Manager, get it.  It's cool!\n\n*When the package manager window appears, click \"Reload\" in the toolbar.\n\n*If that doesn't work, you should review your repository information by selecting \"Repositories\" from the Settings menu, and make adjustments there.\n\n*\"Mark\" the packages you want installed (Synaptic touchpad, etc.) by clicking the checkboxes next to their names and then clicking \"mark for installation\" from the submenu.\n\n*Click \"Apply\" from the toolbar.\nThomas Mahoney\n", "Q: Oracle VirtualBox focus not changing I run VirtualBox in many environments and in Ubuntu this is the only place where I have come across this bug\nI've installed the latest VirtualBox and this problem still persists, it's odd\nBasically it's when you have a VM open with the display as full screen when you click on the minimise button on the options menu, the place where you can select to install guest additions from you see the VM minimise animation go off to the launcher but then when you move the mouse focus goes back to the minimised VM once you click on it again focus goes back to your desktop\nI'm currently running Ubuntu 13.04 but I happens with 12.10 as well\nIf you need further detail maybe I'll be able to post a video of it, I think what I'd like to know is anyone else having this issue?\n\nA: (Since my deduction was accurate, I'll make it an answer.)\nSounds like a Unity issue.

Today, after much searching, I found the command XDG_CURRENT_DESKTOP= keepassx which is supposed to work in \"Startup Applications\" on 12.04. So far, I've only managed to get it to work from the terminal. But after months of research this feels like leap forward to finally see the keepassx icon in the system-tray! So, I'd hate to give up now. Does anyone feel like helping me figure out how to get this command to work as the default way to start keepassx? Or as a Startup App? \n\nA: I figured it out. Not sure if I should delete the question now or leave it with an answer for anyone else to use. I'll just answer and let the mods decide.\n\n\n*\n\n*Open gedit and enter:\n'XDG_CURRENT_DESKTOP= keepassx'  \n\n*Save as a \".sh\" file-type. Just remember where.  \n\n*Right click on your .sh and select Properties, go to the Permissions tab - check the box next to \"Execute\".  \n\n*In Startup Applications select Edit for KeepassX. In the Edit window next to \"Command:\" use the Browse button and select your .sh.\n\n*Once KeepassX opens in startup for the first time after these changes you'll need to go to settings and enable the system tray functions by checking the according boxes.\nNote: The KeepassX setting \"Minimize to tray instead of task bar\" may be problematic since the panel/systray icon offers no option to show the KeepassX GUI. The icon offers the same two functions when right or left-clicking - Quit and lock.

Unfortunately, this isn't as common as wanting to sort the contents of a file, or (even more so) wanting to list the contents of a folder in a particular order (alphabetically or by size, for example), so Google has very little for me...\nClarification: The numbers in the file are real, usually on exponential form.

Debian Live is the tool used to generate LiveCD images now for Ubuntu.  There is a manual available for it that notes there is an extension that handles producing Ubuntu-style LiveCDs but says very little about what said extensions do.  Ubuntu is listed on the downstream projects page yet there is nothing for our usage of Debian Live.  \nThere is a blueprint from the O cycle logged on the wiki logged by Colin Watson.  That's the only thing I could find that tangentially talks about this on the wiki.  Elsewhere searches just lead back to the web-based copies of manual pages.\nThe main reason for doing this is to avoid going down the route discussed here of building a bespoke netboot image with a tightly tuned preseed for my BeagleBoard-xM.  A way to do this using live-build would be nice.  It would also be nice to be able to keep disc images re-spun with updates for those Erie Looking Productions may pick up as collaborators who want to migrate to *buntu.\n\nA: As noted by Alan Pope, there is not currently documentation for cross-building for ARM with live-build and it will be necessary to pore over the source code.

I set the udisks rule recommended in this post, and the spinning-up went from all the time to just some of the time.\nI set audit rules, auditctl -w /dev/sde -p rwa -k e, for instance, to try to see what was waking them. Checking the audit results with ausearch, I see entries like this when I ssh in:\ntype=PATH msg=audit(04/16/2013 18:16:40.109:502) : item=0 name=/dev/sde inode=3010 dev=00:05 mode=block,660 ouid=root ogid=disk rdev=08:40 \ntype=CWD msg=audit(04/16/2013 18:16:40.109:502) :  cwd=/home/absqua \ntype=SYSCALL msg=audit(04/16/2013 18:16:40.109:502) : arch=x86_64 syscall=open success=yes exit=3 a0=7fffcd697998 a1=800 a2=0 a3=0 items=1 ppid=14054 pid=14055 auid=root uid=root gid=root euid=root suid=root fsuid=root egid=root sgid=root fsgid=root tty=pts0 ses=408 comm=hdparm exe=/sbin/hdparm key=e\n\nSo, my drives are being woken up by hdparm itself? How can I figure out what's calling it?\n\nA: I was also struggling with this exact issue for a while, having tried audits, the mentioned udisks rule etc. But finally it was blktrace and blkparse that gave me the final hint of the problem: my sleeping disks were accessed by dumpe2fs on ssh login.\nApparently, the following script was the offender, scanning all drives to display which drives will be checked for errors at the next reboot on your motd at login.\n\n/usr/lib/update-notifier/update-motd-fsck-at-reboot\n\nThe script only executes once every hour max, so that explains why it wasn't happening consistently. See lines 21-24:\nif [ $(($stampt + 3600)) -lt $now ] || [ $stampt -gt $now ]; then\n    #echo $stampt $now need update\n        NEEDS_FSCK_CHECK=yes\nfi\n\nI decided to disable the automatic check on my system by replacing the variable assignation to : (do nothing). You could also increase the minimum time difference of 3600 seconds to something like a day or a week. But I found it preferable to run the script with --force during midnight maintenance when all my disks are awake anyhow. Since this script is purely informational it should be safe to just replace it with return 0 if you're not interested in this information.\nI hope this helps anyone having the same or a similar issue. Even if it's another culprit on your system, I found blktrace and blkparse invaluable for diagnosing the problem.\n\nA: Building on the answer by jvanhie: Another way to stop the /usr/lib/update-notifier/update-motd-fsck-at-reboot script from running every hour and during login, without modifying it, is to put this line in /etc/crontab:\n01 * * * * root f=/var/lib/update-notifier/fsck-at-reboot ; test -e $f && touch $f\n\nThat will update the time stamp file checked by the script every hour if it exists, which will fool the script into thinking it has already run that hour.\nYou don't have to modify the script, and so you don't have to remember to carry forward any modifications after any system updates (though a more robust solution would issue an error warning if the time stamp file were not being used).\n", "Q: How to fix location of Windows from second grub I originally had Windows Vista, later upgraded to 7.\nThen I used wubi to install Kubuntu alongside Windows 7 - my load screen became the black one with white writing (grub legacy I believe).\nThen I (deliberately) somehow deleted Kubuntu, though I can't remember how. I may have just removed the partition!\nThen I installed an SSD, and cloned Windows 7 partition to the SSD.\nThen I installed Ubuntu on the original drive, and deleted the old Windows.\nThe problem is that somehow I've ended up with two boot screens.\nThe first is the blue screen (grub 2 I believe) which lists Ubuntu and Windows.\nUbuntu boots fine, but if I select Windows, it takes me to the original black and white boot screen, offering Kubuntu and Windows 7.

I've linked the disk summary from boot-repair below.\nhttp://paste.ubuntu.com/5714899/\nI guess the problem must be that there is an old grub legacy hanging around somewhere - how can I get rid of it?\n\nA: Alex, You installed Kubuntu using wubi, that's called inside windows installation not alongside. \nIn  wubi installation , kubuntu splits windows bcd file and creates entry for kubuntu.  When kubuntu crashed, you needed  to fix windows bcd using rebuild bcd command as guided here, beacuse grub installs after splitting windows' bcd file. \nThis will remove old grub completely. After this You will able to boot windows only , and you need to reinstall grub. After successfully  grub installation you will get both boot entries.\n", "Q: Does Ubuntu 12.04 works for an Asus g75vw? I have an Asus g75vw, I tired to install ubuntu 12.04 but for some reason it damaged my windows installation and it never loaded me ubuntu to start installing it.

You can always test Ubuntu hardware compatibility by booting from a Live cd or Usb drive. Chances are if your hardware is new 10.04 is not the way to go, try booting from the 12.04 Ubuntu cd (Hopefully it is the live disk) or usb drive and see if your hardware functions normally (albiet slowly because it's running from optical).\n", "Q: Is it possible to have Windows 8 and Ubuntu on the same hard drive? It's my understanding that you can't have two different filesystems (NTFS and ext4) on the same hard drive, but that's exactly what I need to do to run both operating systems on the laptop I've ordered.\nI'll only be running 64-bit operating systems on the computer, if that changes anything.\n\nA: You can have several file systems on your hard drive, each one on their own partition. For example:\n\nIn this image we can see a hard drive (SDD) which has 4 partitions:\nsdd1 - Which holds an ext2 filesystem partition.\nsdd2 - Which holds an ext4 filesystem partition.\nsdd3 - Which holds an Fat32 filesystem partition.\nsdd4 - Which holds an NTFS filesystem partition.  \nAs you can see, we have 4 filesystems on the same hard drive, each one on their own partition. What you can't have is 2 filesystems on the same partition, since a partition gets assign a particular filesystem (One filesystem to rule the whole partition).\nI am showing you 4 here since this is the max partitions a single hard drive can have as primary. This is only true for MSDOS Partition Schemes. If you use GPT you can have as many as 128 primary partitions.\nIf you stay on the MSDOS Partition Scheme and still want more than 4 partitions, then you would create what is called a Logical or Extended partition, which holds more partitions inside of it and takes 1 from the total number of primary partitions. So you can have for example 3 primary partitions and 1 logical partition which holds 4 more partitions inside of it.\nYou could even get to a crazy point like this:\n\n\nA: Yes it is possible, you can find info here:\nDual-boot Windows 8 and Ubuntu 12.10 on UEFI hardware\n", "Q: Installation problem Ihave created a separate partion for Ubuntu and when I use the windows installer  to install Ubuntu into that drive i'm facing an error while extracting kernel that \"An error has occurred setting the element data. the request is not supported.\"\n\nA: I'm not 100% sure about that but the better option I found was (in my case) to install ubuntu 12.04 as a virtual machine in windows desktop, whereas I preferred to have ubuntu-only on a separate laptop. \n", "Q: Can I change my stock amd fan speed? I have an amd a4-5300, and it it running loud. I remember my last amd stock fan being silent. I can't change it in my bios, and I see that it might be possible to do through Ubuntu when googling. I bet I could do it through the overclocking software that came with my MSI FM2-A75MA-E35 motherboard. Should I try that in WINE or is there a fan control program that everyone already uses with wine?\n\nA: try echoing a lower value to /sys/class/hwmon/hwmon0/device/pwm2 your fan will also have to be plugged into a fan header that supports variable speed. i believe the max is 255 so try something like echo > 176 /sys/class/hwmon/hwmon0/device/pwm2 you will need to be root\n\nA: Programs like that aren't going to work in WINE since they have to load a windows driver to access the hardware.\nYou might try installing the lm-sensors package and running the sensors-detect script.  It will probe for certain control chips that can be used for temperature monitoring and fan control.  If found, it will walk you through loading the correct driver.  Getting it to work often requires that you add acpi_enforce_resources=lax to your kernel command line.  Then you can configure the fancontrol script to monitor temperature and adjust the fan speed.\n", "Q: Can't see LOCAL java applets in my browser So I setup the Java plugin for Firefox, and can see applets that are not stored locally.

I changed LightDM to GDM. When I boot up keyboard layout changes to default US layout. When I add another layout to end of list at Region settings my selected layout becomes active. What should I do ?\n\nA: I also have the same problem. I did a lot of research, but I have not found a solution for me. Instead, for many people, this was the solution:\n\n\n*\n\n*Open Terminal\n\n*Type sudo vim /etc/default/keyboard\n\n*The values ​​within the file should be as follows:\nXKBMODEL=\"pc105\"\nXKBLAYOUT=\"it\"\nXKBVARIANT=\"\"\nXKBOPTIONS=\"\"\n\n\n*XKBLAYOUT is the code of your keyboard layout.

I had the same problem with the US layout I wanted to use and kept having to remove and readd each time I logged into Ubuntu 13.04. It kept reverting back to the UK Keyboard layout, despite having run: \ndpkg-reconfigure keyboard-configuration\n(EVEN WHEN THE LANGUAGE ICON ON THE TOP RIGHT OF THE SCREEN ACTUALLY SAYS 'en US') so this is definitely a serious bug as even changing keyboard layouts by clicking on them is completely unresponsive! Hope there will be some kind of fix for this soon.\nAnyway, I found that, in fact, simply typing the command:\n\nsetxkbmap\n\ninto the 'Startup Applications' command tab solves the problem of Ubuntu forgetting the keyboard layout settings upon each boot.\nHOWEVER: I did discover something else: If you are also running xmodmap in startup, then it will be OVERWRITTEN by the setxkbmap command. The setxkbmap command thus overrides the xmodmap commands at startup. (I found this out because I had finally succeeded in getting Ubuntu to remember my keybinding of Scroll Lock (which I use for my backlit keyboard) by means of running an .Xmodmap file including the modification (in my case：\n\nadd mod3 = Scroll_Lock\n\nWould be nice if anyone has any ideas on how to be able to run both on startup, at least until there is a permanent fix for the very very common, obvious and serious language layout problem in Ubuntu (i.e. Ubuntu forgetting keyboard layout settings after every boot).\n\nA: *\n\n*Open Terminal by hitting Alt+Ctrl+T.\n\n*Login with root, su\n\n*Enter Pass\n\n*Type dpkg-reconfigure keyboard-configuration\n\n*exit\n\n\nReboot and recheck.

Since 3.8.0 => no more resume. With the recent 3.9.0-rc6, one dev reproduced and analyzed the issue with resume, and found some interesting tracks. \nTo be continued ...\n\nIf you want to follow the development, see :\nhttp://lists.freedesktop.org/archives/intel-gfx/\nAnd you'll understand how difficult things are ;-)\n\n-- ericb\n\nA: For anyone still struggling with suspend on a macbook here's a solution that worked for me: https://forums.debian.net/viewtopic.php?t=149965\nMore precisely:\n1. open terminal: sudo nano /etc/default/grub\n2. go to: GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX=\" \" and add to: GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX=\"init_on_alloc=0\"\n3. save and exit\n4. sudo update-grub\n5. reboot pc\n\n", "Q: ~/.profile OR ~/.bashrc OR ~/.pam_environment to define PATH variable for user and root Which one of these files should I edit to define the PATH variable both for my normal user and for root?\nI have added in normal user and as root but there is error as shown below. \nI read in one of the Ubuntu environment sites that pam_environment is now to be used.

I have several email addresses attached to the domain that it hosted on the VPS, one of them is say user@domain.com. The owner of this email address has two personal computers and no more and they've up until now been using Thunderbird to access the email address.\nA couple of days ago the inbox for user@domain.com started getting slammed with hundreds and hundreds of bouncebacks an hour, the owner of user@domain.com deleted her Thunderbird entries for those email accounts yesterday to no avail.\nBoth computers were shut down last night but the address was still receiving bouncebacks. Now initially I thought that because neither computer that had had the account on was turned on, this could be bounceback spam. On closer inspection of the email however, I can see some of them contain lines like:\n<firstnamelsurname@bellsouth.net>: delivery temporarily suspended: host\ngateway-f1.isp.att.net[204.127.217.16] refused to talk to me:\n550-XX.XX.XX.XX blocked by ldap:ou=rblmx,dc=att,dc=net 550 Error -\nBlocked for abuse. See http://att.net/blocks\n\nWhere XX.XX.XX.XX is the IP Address of our VPN. This makes me think that it's something wrong with the postfix server (as well most likely as an infection on the computers. A full clamscan produced the following:\n    /var/qmail/mailnames/DOMAIN.COM/USER/Maildir/.Spam/cur/1366042516.M831269P7021V0000000000000025I0000000003C08ED0.VPS-DOMAIN.COM,S=152011:2,: Email.Trojan-432 FOUND\n    /usr/share/MailScanner/MailScanner/MessageBatch.pm: Eicar-Test-Signature-1 FOUND\n\nAny ideas how I can track down the issue/solve the problem?\nThanks.\n\nA: \"Bounce\" emails are sometimes part of a spam attack, though I doubt this is the case in your instance.\n550-XX.XX.XX.XX blocked by ldap:ou=rblmx,dc=att,dc=net 550 Error - Blocked for abuse.\n\nThis leads me to believe that your server IP has made a blacklist - particularly one with att.net. I would check your domain on mxtoolbox.com and check that you're not running an open relay, and you're not blacklisted\nIf you are on a dedicated IP, you're going to have to resolve this with ATT / Bell South. If you're using a dynamic IP on a residential account, it will be a bit stickier to resolve, as most ISP's have a low threshold of support for users running servers on non-business accounts, and provisioning usually means that you could be getting blocked because one of your neighbors is/was part of a spam botnet and the shared IP got blocked.\nWith any email system sending and receiving to the public-at-large, I would be running a virus filter like clamav. \n\nA: What is installed on the VPS besides PostFix? What systems and/or users are allowed to send mail through your VPS?\nYou can check the log of Postfix to see what and/or who is sending mail through PostFix.\ncat /var/log/mail.log\n\nWhat I experienced a lot in these situations is that a customer has a virus that abuses his Outlook which uses our mailserver to send mail. It could be that one user is sending SPAM through his/her account.\n", "Q: Unable to Run Nvidia Settings I am using Dell Latitude E6510 laptop with Ubuntu 12.10 running on it.\nIt has Nvidia GT218 NVS 3100M.\nI am using Gnome-Fallback mode. \nMy problem is that my laptop was just working fine.\nHowever, it was having very high temperatures (+70 degrees normally). \nSo I read about some blogs, where someone advised to install Jupiter and nvidia-bumblebee.

I need to use sshpass to launch a remote command through SSH from a Java code.\nIf I manually type in a console:\nssh -p 22 user@ipaddress mplayer '/media/data/myFavouriteSong.mp3'\n\nworks perfectly, but asks for password. So I tried running sshpass:\nsshpass -p mypass ssh -p 22 user@ipaddress mplayer '/media/data/myFavouriteSong.mp3'\nsshpass -p mypass ssh -l user@ipaddress mplayer '/media/data/myFavouriteSong.mp3'\nsshpass -p mypass ssh -t user@ipaddress mplayer '/media/data/myFavouriteSong.mp3'\nsshpass -p mypass ssh user@ipaddress echo 'OK'\n\nand none of them work.\n\nA: I think you want something like:\nsshpass -p yourpassword ssh user@ipaddress somecommand\n\nFor instance, this works for me:\nsshpass -p mypassword ssh username@10.0.0.9 touch foo\n\n\nA: This may be caused by the host-key checks done by ssh. It looks like sshpass keeps silent on invalid host keys (no output on neither stderr nor stdout) and exists with status-code 6. At the time of this writing, this was revision 50, and the matching constant in the code is RETURN_HOST_KEY_UNKNOWN, which hints to that error.\nYour error-code may differ and looking at the code linked above may give you some insight.\nIf your issue is an invalid host-key you should think twice about overriding the error with a CLI option. Your machine could be compromised or you may be subject to a MITM attack! If you are 100% certain that this is not the case and if you have no means to keep the verified host-keys up-to date, you can use a command like this:\nsshpass -pfoobar ssh -o StrictHostKeyChecking=no user@host command_to_run\n\n\nA: *\n\n*make a key\nssh-keygen -t rsa\n\n*make a .ssh folder on the remote server it will ask for a password\nssh $USER@SEVERNAME mkdir -p .ssh\n\n*copy the key to the remote server\ncat .ssh/id_rsa.pub | ssh $USER@SERVER 'cat >> .ssh/authorized_keys'\n\nCheck if it asks for a password, if not it should work.\nssh $USER@SEVERNAME 'command'\n\n\nA: sshpass command works only if the password prompt ends in assword:.\nIf your password prompt is different you may have to adjust the source code of sshpass to recognize the prompt you have.\nI have seen password prompts like  Password for user@host: on some systems, maybe this is your problem.\n\nA: sshpass syntax is\nsshpass [-ffilename|-dnum|-ppassword|-e] [options] command arguments\n\nNote that there is no space between the -p and the password.\nAlso I've noticed that you have to connect with ssh at least once manually to obtain the RSA key of the machine you are connecting to, to go into the ~/.ssh/known_hosts file before sshpass will allow you to connect.\nso after obtaining the entry in the known_hosts file I can run a command such as\nsshpass -ffilename_with_password_in_it ssh user@server uname -a\n\nand it will execute the command uname -a on the remote server and output the results to the standard out on the local machine.\n\nA: There is lots of way to do that, here is my suggested solution:\nFirst of all, storing your password in a variable is give you more flexible commands. sshpass has an option for that:\n-e: this option allows to read password from $SSHPASS environment variable\nYou have two way to set this variable:\n\n\n*\n\n*Set directly in your code:\nexport SSHPASS='your_pass'\n\n\n*Or ask for it:\nreadPassword () {\n  echo Ssh Password: \n  read -s SSHPASS\n  eval \"export SSHPASS='\"\"$SSHPASS\"\"'\"\n}\n\n# read password\n\nreadPassword\n\nThan execute your command;\n\n\n*\n\n*If your command is static, run it directly:\nsshpass -e ssh user@host << EOF\nmplayer '/media/data/myFavouriteSong.mp3'\ncommand2 parameter1 parameter2 parameter3 ...\ncommand3 parameter1 parameter2 parameter3 ...\n...\nEOF\n\n\n*If your command will be dynamic use like this:\nDYN_FILE_LOC='/media/data/myFavouriteSong.mp3'\n\neval 'sshpass -e ssh user@host << EOF\nmplayer \"$DYN_FILE_LOC\"\ncommand2 parameter1 parameter2 parameter3 ...\ncommand3 parameter1 parameter2 parameter3 ...\n...\nEOF'\n\nhope this helps someone.\n\nA: sshpass uses pseudo terminals and the man page includes apologies for breaking occasionally.  You can also try fd0ssh.  It works if you do not need to send stdin to a process on the remote machine.

Instead, I am getting a fast alternation of button press and button release which has a slight delay that is causing the panning to be jerky. The line that I use in .xbindkeysrc looks like this:\n\n\"echo 'buttonpress 2 buttonrelease 2' | xmacroplay :0\"\n    m:0x0 + c:225\n    XF86Search\n\nI suspect the problem is the buttonrelease 2 command. but I'm not sure. Is there anyway I can make the button press and hold command until I release the button on the mouse?\n\nA: Well I have found the answer. I used xdotool instead of xmacroplay and used the following code:\n\"echo 'mousedown 2' | xdotool - :0\"\n    m:0x0 + c:225\n\"echo 'mouseup 2' | xdotool - :0\"\n  release + m:0x0 + c:225\n    XF86Search \n\nThe key is the \"release +\" feature. without it, the mousedown 2 will force a constant click on middle mouse button.

Is there a way to write the commands down to a script that would disable one of the external screens in an Ubuntu 12.04 Virtualbox machine, every time the Windows 7 laptop is plugged to the two external screens I have?\nI find myself manually disabling the screen through \"System Settings\" and I would like to be able to speed up this process by having it written in a script. Ideally, the script would listen to the list of connected monitors and kick in every time the second monitor is plugged in. Any ideas?\n\nA: I use an script called monitor1 which disables my secondary monitor. It contains  this:\n#!/bin/sh\n#final()\n#coding=utf8\n\n# Desactiva el monitor secundari:\n\nxrandr --output DVI-I-1 --off\n\nOf course, you'll have to change DVI-I-1 with the name of the  monitor you want to disable. To enable both monitors I use other script called monitor2:\n#!/bin/sh\n#final()\n#coding=utf8\n\n# Activa el monitor secundari com extensió del primari:\n\nxrandr --output DVI-I-1 --mode 1280x1024 --noprimary --pos 1024x0\n\nThis re-activates the secondary monitor and places it to the top right of the primary monitor.\nTo find out which monitors do you have (which names) you can use  xrandr:\nxrandr --current\n\nFor instance, mine looks  like this:\n    Screen 0: minimum 8 x 8, current 2646 x 1024, maximum 16384 x 16384\nDVI-I-0 connected 1366x768+0+0 (normal left inverted right x axis y axis) 410mm x 230mm\nDVI-I-1 connected 1280x1024+1366+0 (normal left inverted right x axis y axis) 352mm x 264mm\n\nAs you can see, I have a primary monitor always on and a secondary one I turn off when  playing games on fullscreen, specially with wine.\nHope it helps, good luck!\n", "Q: incremental backup tool that can handle interruptions? Is there a recommended incremental backup tool that can handle interruptions such as the external USB disk being disconnected in the middle of an update?\n\nA: Rsync  / Grsync \nThe command line file transfer utility Rsync and its GUI Grsync is designed for file transfers via a network connection but can also nicely used for local backup purposes. Due to its provenience from networking it is capable of performing backups with a resume option by using the option --partial or -P:\n\n--partial By  default, rsync will delete any partially transferred file if        the transfer is interrupted. In some circumstances  it  is  more desirable   to  keep  partially  transferred  files.  Using  the --partial option tells rsync to  keep  the  partial  file  which should  make  a subsequent transfer of the rest of the file much faster Manpage rsync\n\nWe are also able to define a directory where rsync will store partially transferred files until transfer was complete with the option --partial-dir=<DIR>.\nAn example command for a partial incremental upgrade would be something like:\nrsync -auxP <source> <destination>\n\n\nBut: by all means do not unplug an external USB drive while running a backup as this puts the integrity of your whole filesystem at risk. Do not trust a backup on  a temporarily unplugged drive!\n\n\nA: I think your best bet is a mix of rsync and sharing the USB device over the network and using rsync to copy the folders. rsync will handle the file level stuff and the network layer means windows will handle the disconnection of the USB drive and in turn shut down the share which means rsync will fail. Or at least as far as I can tell.\nOtherwise I think you should start looking at cloud based disk storage as a more complete out of the box solution.\n", "Q: folder on /var/www is forbidden,why?

I've downloaded Ubuntu 12.10, and mounted it using virtual clone drive. I chose Demo and full Installation and on the next page I chose Help me to boot from CD and I clicked Finish button. It installed successfully. After reboot I got the option to choose OS and I've chose Ubuntu. It's loaded, but I don't know what to do after the initramfs and I don't even know whats is that.\nWhat should I do?\n\nA: I don't have any experience using the Windows Installer of Ubuntu, so please don't be offended if I write total nonsense. \nIf I'm not mistaken you installed the Ubuntu boot manager (grub2) on your HDD in order to use it to load Ubuntu from the Ubuntu CD. Since your Ubuntu CD is not a physical disk, but a CD image that you mounted in a virtual drive emulated using a Windows program, the boot loader (which is executed before any OS is loaded and therefore also before any virtual CD drives are available) cannot find the CD and therefore fails to load anything from it.\nMy suggested solution is simple: Burn a real Ubuntu CD and boot from it, either by using the boot loader already installed on your HDD, or by simply booting directly from the CD using the boot device selection option of your BIOS or EFI (actually that's the preferred way and what you did, installing the boot loader to hdd, is only meant as a workaround for the few computers that cannot boot from CD). Of course you can as well create a Ubuntu Installation USB pen drive by using Unetbootin or a similar tool.\nIf you want to uninstall the Ubuntu boot manager and go back to Windows only, you probably have to rewrite your HDDs master boot record. On Windows 2000 or XP one can for instance boot from the Windows CD, go to Recovery Console and run the fixmbr (or was it fixboot?) command.

The programs are based on libclamav6,\n  which can be used by other software.1\n\nTo install ClamAV, just press Ctrl+Alt+T on your keyboard to open Terminal. When it opens, run the commands below.\nsudo apt-get install clamav clamtk\n\nOnce its done Type clam in Dash, and click on calmTK to start the application.  \n\n\nYou may have to do an update.  Just run sudo freshclam in terminal to update definitions.\nTo update the program Click Here to download the file, once downloaded, go the download location, right click on the file, and choose Open With Ubuntu Software Center\n\n\nAnd click on Update.\n1Source:Ubuntu Apps\n", "Q: How to change the default permission when creating a file in ubuntu In ubuntu, I use a program written by others. This program creates a file on my system and try to read and write it later. But the permission of the file it creates is read-only. How can I change the default permission when creating a file in ubuntu, in home folder. Thanks ahead.\n\nA: I got the answer with green7's help. When I use sudo with other commands, the owner is root and when I use command without sudo, the owner is me.\n", "Q: How do I find out if an external drive is in active use (being read/written to)? I have some external drives connected to a power outlet. The outlet is USB switchable, i.e. I can run a program on my PC that physically disconnects the external drives from the power grid. I only use those drives every once in a while for backup. Often I forget to turn them off (though it is really easy with that switchable outlet).\nNow what I want to do, is check if they are actively in use. That is, I want to know if larger amounts of data have been written or read from them in, say, the last half hour or so. How would I go about such a task?\n\nA: Okay, the best I could do so far was to install sysstat     and then query the following command every once in a while (replace sdX with the name of the drive - you can figure this out by first running iostat -m to identify the drive you want):\niostat -m | grep sdX | tr -s ' ' | cut -d ' ' -f 5-\n\nWhen these two values (read and write) change significantly, the disk is in active use (not generated by a daemon or something).\nI suppose one could do it without installing the bloat of another package by just looking at /proc/diskstats. If anyone has a better, more elegant solution, i'd be happy to here it. \n\nA: If you want you want to list the USB devices (To see if they're in use), you can open a terminal and type lsusb.\nIt might come up with this: (Please note, my output is different to yours)\nBus 001 Device 001: ID 1d6b:0002 Linux Foundation 2.0 root hub\nBus 002 Device 001: ID 1d6b:0002 Linux Foundation 2.0 root hub\nBus 001 Device 002: ID 8087:0020 Intel Corp.

I just got a very weird error message on my Ubuntu 12.04 laptop:\n\nThe only thing I did even close in time before this happened was to eject an SD memory card from the slot. To do so, I first opened File Manager and clicked the little \"Eject\" button next to the disk label for the card. When the disk wasn't in the list anymore, I removed it from the slot.\nIs this a bug, or a problem with my system setup, or with my way of removing the SD card? Obviously there's a problem somewhere - the least you'd expect is an error message that can be read... If it's a bug, what should I report (to Launchpad, I assume)?\nUPDATE:\nI just got another one of these messages. This time I tried to open a LaTeX source file, but since TeXWorks wasn't among the suggested applications I clicked \"Open With\" > \"Other application...\". This is what I got:\n\nSeriously, what's going on here?\n\nA: The text is not scrambled, but some characters in it are not able to display. It should say: System program problem detected.\nApport detects crashes and writes reports to /var/crash. update-notifier watches that directory for changes. When it sees a new report, it puts up the dialog that you saw.\nSee anatomy of a crash for more information.\nI don't know how long it takes for a crash to be detected, so it's hard to know what caused the crash. But you can view the crash reports in /var/crash. \nThe question remains as to why the message can't display properly. You are apparently running your system in English and all of the characters would have the same encoding in ascii and unicode. The primary text (\"System program...\") is displaying in bold. It makes me wonder if perhaps the bold version of that font is corrupted. \nEdit: No applications available to open rapport_utast.tex. Again the problem is with the bold version of the system font. \nTry re-installing ttf-ubuntu-font-family and then rebooting. \nTo re-install use Synaptic  or run in a terminal:\nsudo apt-get --reinstall install ttf-ubuntu-font-family\n\n", "Q: Unable to run compiled files - bash: ./a.out: Permission denied. (I've tried chmod) First of all, there are many questions like this on AU.

So in addition to chmod, you will want to also check your filesystems' mount options.\n", "Q: HP Envy 6 Overheating I've got some overheating issues with my HP Envy 6 1170sf.

When i did the above said job windows started up as usual\n\nA: Sounds like the you didn't install a bootloader that knows about your Ubuntu installation. So Windows just boots like normal. Easiest way is to install again and this time install the bootloader (Grub2) when prompted.\nDuring Grubs installation it will scan your drives and make a list of options to boot into when you reboot. \n\nA: This problem can be solved in the following way:\n\n\n*\n\n*once prompted to remove dvd and close the tray and press enter, do it without any delay.\n\n*now your system starts with windows automatically, if not you start your system.\n\n*wait for all windows services to start.\n\n*now go to startup folder, you will find wubi there.\n\n*click on it and follow the instructions ubuntu gets installed.\n\n\nA: I had the similar problem while installing Ubuntu 14.04, so I did this:\n\n\n*\n\n*My disk partitions were NTFS, so I created unallocated space using GParted (from the Ubuntu LiveCD). \n\n*Make sure you create enough unallocated space.\n\n\nAfter this install Ubuntu.

It sounds like you originally built the array out of the whole disks, so none of them had a partition table, then you partitioned the whole raid array.  In doing so, you ended up with the partition table at the start of the first drive, which is why you now think you see a partition table on that drive, but it claims the disk is larger than it is ( because it is referring to the size of the whole raid array, not the individual disk ).\nUpdate your question to include the results of running mdadm -E on each drive and the contents of /proc/mdstat.\n", "Q: How Do I Change Icons in the Dock \"Plank\"? I'm wondering how I change icons for specifically the dock \"Plank\". I've only managed to find a way to change theme, but not icons for the actual applications in the dock.\nIs it possible? If so, how do you do it?\nThe problem is that I want to use Faenza icons for as my usual icons, but another type of icons for my dock.\nThe current version I'm using is: 0.2.0.796\n\nA: You should make custom .desktop files with the corresponding icon you wish to appear on your dock, i. e. this is my custom minecraft .desktop file:\n[Desktop Entry]\nName=Minecraft\nExec=java -jar /home/myuser/.launchers/Minecraft.jar\nIcon=/home/myuser/.launchers/minecraft.png\nType=Application\n\nReplacing Exec with the program you wish to execute and Icon with the full path to your icon, and don't forget giving execution permissions to the file.\n", "Q: Networking and Traffic routing question Hello I had a few of questions related to networking, let me list them in a logical order:\n1) Can multiple interfaces be bridged together so that it results in increased bandwidth?\n2) Can wired and wireless interfaces be bridged together? \n3) If you have multiple interfaces (both wired and wireless), which one would have higher precedence and where would all the traffic be routed to?\nFor the above questions, I'm referring to a single Linux based system.\nPlease try to explain in details if possible, I didn't find much resources else where to help me on this topic. Also try to point towards reference material(s) where applicable. \nThanks.\n\nA: This is a pretty original question.  I can only answer part 3).\nYour routing table determines which interface is used.\nThe shell command:\nroute\ndumps your current routing table. It shows which network interfaces are being used for each destination network. The output includes a metric for each rule for determining 'precedence' by the routing code in the network stack (part of the Linux kernel).  The default route is the catch-all destination for anything that didn't match other routing rules.\nYou may also use ifconfig -a to see which interfaces are available on your system.\nThe routing table can be also be modified (as root) with the route command by passing the add or del to add or delete routes (man route for full details) but unless you really know what you're doing, you should leave this job to the network manager.\n", "Q: Ubuntu won't let me boot back into Windows after installing on Surface Pro I installed Ubuntu on my Surface Pro, on a completely separate partition from the main Windows 8 partition. I took the same steps I normally do to dual boot on other machines, but now when I start the machine, instead of giving me options to use either OS, it jumps right into Ubuntu. How can I boot back into Windows 8?\n\nA: So I fixed it...\nI restarted and spammed esc until Grub2 showed up. At the bottom of the list is \"Secue Boot\". I selected that and it brought me into the UEFI, where I made it only allow secure OSs. It restarted, said the default OS (Ubuntu) was not secure, and booted into Windows.\n", "Q: Graphics trouble on Asus F55A-SX091D I get system error reports all the time. It's got to do with XORG.

Few months ago I was using gcc 4.6. In order to get C++11 functionality I upgraded to gcc 4.7 using a PPA. Today gcc 4.7 was recommended to me through the update manager. I just mindlessly clicked \"Install all available updates\". \nNow when I try to build my project in C++, I get the following error:\n\nThe first thing that came to my mind was to uninstall gcc and install it again through the Synaptic Package Manager. \nBut something tells me that things may not be as straightforward as it seems. Compiler is an essential part of the OS and I am afraid I can lose the capacity to install anything. I remember that when I was upgrading to gcc 4.7 from gcc 4.6 things were also not so trivial.\nPlease, where can I find more information on the subject? Is it ok to just reinstall the gcc using Synaptic?\n\nA: Debian packages (.deb, used also by Ubuntu) are packages consisting of compiled binaries (unless you want the source code package). This means that during installation, there is no need for a compiler - the necessary files are already compiled, they are just unpacked.\nIt should be safe to purge the offending gcc and install the version from the main repository, but there is no guarantee it will work without problems.\nTo help you get rid of the PPA from which you installed gcc4.7, take a look at PPA-Purge, which helps you with cleaning custom PPAs - it will automatically downgrade all packages to official version and remove the PPA from the system.\n", "Q: How can I configure Apache2 for SSL and install a SSL certificate?

I recently switched to Linux from Windows and really like Ubuntu but I have alot of Windows games I can't play anymore.\n\nA: Free solution\nThere are several ways to run Windows games on Ubuntu. You could try Play On Linux, which is a front end of Wine. It is more user friendly to install a good number of windows games on Ubuntu.\nNot only Play On Linux, you could also try Stream. Recently, Valve games released a native Ubuntu client of Stream. This'll help you to play a lot of popular windows games on Ubuntu.\nLastly, you can also try Wine separately. To get a detailed list of supported games by Wine click here\nAnd importantly, you can install all these applications from Ubuntu Software Center, along with using commands in Terminal.\nPaid solution\nAlong with free solution you can also choose paid solution, if you want. Crossover Linux is very good paid solution. They have different type of packages with professional support.\n\nA: As already mentioned, WINE is a very good option. Besides opening the terminal and running sudo apt-get install wine, you can also find it by searching for WINE in the Ubuntu Software Center (I know every user isn't comfortable venturing into the terminal, and I don't want you to think you have to use it if you don't want to).\nWINE works very well for most programs, but some may require some tinkering in the WINE configuration to get things set up just right.  In my experience older programs are more likely to run without issue than newer programs are, but there are plenty of exceptions in both of those categories.\nFor a database of software that works in WINE, along with ratings of how well the software works, you can look at the official site here.\n\nIf you are willing to pay money for additional convenience, there is also a program called CrossOver, released by CodeWeavers. CrossOver is built on top of and using WINE, and CodeWeavers is the largest contributor to the WINE project, so while CodeWeavers does make money off of your purchase, at least some of the purchase price goes back into development of WINE.\nThere is a free trial of CrossOver available in the Software Center that will work for 15 days, if you would like to give both WINE and CrossOver a try and see which meets your needs better.\n\nA: You can use Wine.  To install, just press Ctrl+Alt+T on your keyboard to open Terminal. When it opens, run the commands below.\nsudo apt-get install wine\n\nFor more information on Wine Click Here\n", "Q: Turn off my touchpad Ubuntu 12.10 I am not a fan of the trackpad/touchpad and I want to turn it off while using Ubuntu and I can't figure out how. I have a Dell Inspiron N5110 running Windows 8 with a dual boot option of Ubuntu 12.10. \nThe Dell Touchpad Properties show:\n \"Driver\"\nDriver Provider:  Alps\nDriver Date:  7/12/12\nDriver Version: 8.1200.101.209\nDigital Signer: Microsoft Windows Hardware Compatibility publisher\n\n \"General\"\nDevice type: Mice and other pointing devices\nManufacturer: Alps Electric\nLocation: plugged into PS/2 mouse port\n\nIn Windows 8 the Fn shortcut is Fn+F3 and that works but in Ubuntu it does not, even though a red box appears in the top right corner indicating it may have.

A feature of Word 2010 I love is the capability of inserting truly inline mathematical equations.\nBy \"truly inline\" I mean that for all intents and purposes, editing or adding a mathematical formula feels like editing or typing regular text, all in place. No \"Insert Object\" or \"Insert formula\" or such things.\nThis is one of the reasons I still use Windows.\nCan I get this functionality in Ubuntu, eg in LibreOffice, as well?\n\nA: In LibreOffice Writer you can actually write the formula \"code\" and afterwards select it and by using the \"Insert Formula\" button it converts it directly to pretty print formula. You could map the \"Insert Formula\" function to a keyboard shortcut and do it much faster that way. I'm an engineer, so I type quite a number of formulas per document and this is the method I use. It works for me, maybe it could work also for you. Below, I'm putting the formula \"code\" for the equation of velocity.\nV={%DELTA x} over {%DELTA t}\n\nAn image of the this code rendered by Writer:\n\n\nA: You could try Dmaths (see a demonstration video), a free software extension for LibreOffice. Formulas are an object in LibreOffice, so they will be not, to use your own expression, \"truly inline\".\nBut if you are not afraid to learn something new (but LaTeX scares you), I would definitely recommend GNU TeXmacs. The files will not be in a format that LibreOffice or MS Office can recognize, as far as I know, but you will be able to type quite simply all the math you want, and more. GNU TeXmasc is a WYSIWYW (what you see is what you want) editor.\nLaTex is still the best, in my opinion, to create beautiful documents. If you can't wait to see the output of what you are writing, you can (almost) do it if you edit your documents with LyX. LyX is WYSIWYM (what you see is what you mean) editor.\nLibreOffice and MS Word both are WYSIWYG (what you see is what you get) applications.\nGood luck!\n\nA: These are all great answers. I am a fan of TexMaths, personally. It's a LaTeX equation editor for LO that supports inline equations. Coupled with a WYSIWG equation editor such as EqualX or Daum Equation Editor it's a very powerful tool.\n", "Q: How do I trigger a script to re-run every time there is a kernel upgrade? Say, for example, I have a custom kernel module.  \nIs there a way to trigger a rebuild on every kernel upgrade in a generic way such that I can perform an arbitrary task (recompile the kernel module) on every kernel upgrade?\n\nA: Take a look at the man page for kernel-img.conf\nhttp://manpages.ubuntu.com/manpages/intrepid/man5/kernel-img.conf.5.html\nThe postinst_hook keyword identifies a script you can select to run at installation.  Other keys select other times to run scripts, like at removal.\n", "Q: How can I share files between Windows XP and Ubuntu 12.04? I am new to Ubuntu, trying to share files between OS's dual boot XP, Ubuntu 12.04.\nAre there programs to load on each OS to do this?\n\nA: The easiest way is having a third partition formated in FAT32 and mounting it automatically in /etc/fstab. This partition will be seen by Ubuntu and WindowsXP without problem, so you could use it to save all you need.\n\nA: NTFS or FAT32 partition should be recognized, but id not you can simply mount it with Partition manager. I've been working this way for several years with no problem...\nOn the other hand you'd might like to access Ubuntu files from XP. For this you need program either to mount linux (ext2,ext3 or ext4) partition as drive. Explore2fs, Ext2Fsd, DiskInternals Linux Reader... There are many! I had no problems with ext2 or ext3, but there were problems with reading ext4. Some programs might have problems writing to ext partition... Google it.  \nPs: I also made a different partition for /home directory, so that reading from XP wouldn't harm root of linux... Just to stay in the safe zone ;)\n\nA: Ubuntu will read/write all the information that you have in the Windows partition, because those partitions would be FAT or NTFS and both partitions are recognized by Ubuntu.\nThe problem is in Windows (as always). Windows can read/write the previously mentioned system formats, but it can not recognize extX (ext2, ext3 or ext4) partitions.\nSo, if you Ubuntu system is in a extX partition (must of the cases) it won't be recognized by Windows.

Additionally the explanation of problems regarding switching back to BIOS (may be referred to as Legacy) is very well done in an easy to understand way can be found here.\nGoing by your update which confirms you are using an uefi entry to boot Ubuntu.\nWhat has possibly happened is that switching from uefi to whichever setting switches off uefi just means you do not have the right boot files in the right place.

I have a 64bit laptop running win 8 on my main partition and Ubuntu on another. My motherboard is UEFI if that makes a difference and here is my problem...\nThe current Ubuntu install is 32-bit. Since there is no way to \"upgrade\" to 64-bit, how would I go about uninstalling Ubuntu (without breaking my windows partition) so I can then re-install? Easiest methods would be appreciated but anything would be great.\n\nA: Deleting the Ubuntu partitions and re-installing using the 64-bit Ubuntu installer should do the trick. It should also be possible to install the 64-bit Ubuntu directly over the old Ubuntu partitions. I don't have step-by-step instructions handy for either approach, since I don't recall every detail of the Ubuntu installer. The details of deleting partitions will also depend on the tool you use (GParted, parted, gdisk, etc.).\nOne caveat: If you're booting Windows in EFI mode (as is almost certainly the case if your computer came with Windows pre-installed), you probably want to do an EFI-mode installation of Ubuntu. You should check for an EFI-mode boot of the Ubuntu installation medium by looking for the directory /sys/firmware/efi. If it's present, you've booted in EFI mode. If it's absent, you've probably booted in BIOS/CSM/legacy mode. In the latter case, you should fiddle with your firmware settings and/or with your boot-time options to get the installer to boot in EFI mode. Note also that EFI-mode installations can still be trouble-prone because of buggy EFI implementations and less mature EFI support in Ubuntu. The number of potential problems is huge, which makes it impractical to describe all the possible problems; but fortunately, each such problem is rare, so there's a good chance you'll get through the process without incident. If you have problems, you'll just have to do a Web search or seek help on your specific problem. (IMHO, a forum is better for solving such problems than a site like this one, which is best for answering general questions that apply to many people.)\nFor additional detailed instructions, see UEFI in the Community Help.\n\nA: click else(the choice at the bottom when installation program asks you whether to upgrade)\nan then click next. when it displays the partition table, choose the partition \"/\", \"/home\"(if there is one) and other ubuntu partition if you want and then edit them to make them serve as what they did previously (e.g. edit \"/\" then choose \"ext4\" option and finally choose \"/\" option before clicking yes).

With a little bit of HTML magic, one can even trick unwitting web site visitors into executing shell commands without their knowledge. The trick is by no means new, but it is currently being demonstrated again on several web sites which means Linux users especially have to be careful what they copy and paste.\n\nHow do users of Ubuntu 12.10 mitigate the problem?\n\nA: Some simple ways of avoiding this problem:\n\n\n*\n\n*Select (Drag the mouse over) only the text you see. If this is found in multiple lines, do not drag the mouse downwards to select all the lines. Instead, select each line, one by one and only select the text you can actually see. Of course this does not work always (In fact as Chaskes mentions and the link provided shows, it will still carry the malicious code with it). You would still need to copy/paste the content in a text file first.  \n\n*Another quicker way is to go Rambo on the text and simply select the whole thing. Then paste this in gedit for instance. There you will be able to see if it contains anything suspicious on it.\n\n*A nice trick to detect this kind of malicious codes is to double click it. When you double click some of this types of hidden codes, the selectable part will become highlighted I might show something that looks just plain wrong. For example, here are 2 cases related to the same article:\n\nIn this case, I double clicked the ls part. I would assume as a normal user that it would have highlighted the whole line, but instead did the above. This shows that ls and the rest of the line of code is NOT on the same HTML element, giving you a hint that there is something wrong with the HTML. It could be wrong tag or malicious intent.\n\nIn this one, you can see the highlighted part keeps on going to the right and although, in this case if you paste the copy code to gedit it will show the correct information, this is another way of using the malicious code. The code could be hidden to the right and by double clicking it, even if you do not see it, the highlighted part would still take it (For example, changing the menu on the right to a z-index value higher than the rest and to top it off, a position that makes sure everything looks \"good\".\nIn neither of this cases, double clicking the code gave you the actual line. I want to also add that if you double click and it selects the whole line, like in the second example, it might not be a bad thing in some sites. The site could have handled the selected area as the whole line instead of selecting only the text as the following example illustrates:\n\nAs you can see, I double clicked on the command but it highlighted the whole line. Yes, there could be some evil code behind this, but since the site is trusted, it lowers the chance of this happening (Still, to make sure, paste the content to a text editor).\nWhat it actually should NOT do a select half of the code then do what the first image I posted did which is to jump to the bottom of the page for no \"appearing reason\" instead of selecting the whole line where it is.\nIt is very easy to execute this and also very easy to avoid it altogether.\nIn my case, if it is pretty long (And I trust the site am copying it from) then I put it in gedit.\n\nA: The easiest way is probably to first paste the text into a plain-text editor like Gedit. I developed this habit as a way to strip surrounding web formatting or objects that are sometimes copied by accident, but it will also let you see everything you copied.\nYou can also right-click in the browser document and view the page source to see what's really there.\n", "Q: When I try to run .sh files nothing happens?

The easiest way to run .sh shell script in Linux or UNIX is to type the following commands. Open the terminal (your shell prompt) and type the command:\nsh filename.sh\n\nOR\nbash filename.sh\n\nSome time you need root access to install application; without root, you won't have the necessary permissions to install application or make system level modifications.

Another option is to use the su command as follows to become superuser:\nsu root\n\nType root user password and finally run your script:\nbash filename.sh\n\nAnother recommend option is to set an executable permission using the chmod command as follows:\nchmod +x filename.sh\n\nNow your can run your .sh file as follows\n./filename.sh\n\n\nA: *\n\n*To exectue a .sh file,first you move to the directory which contains the .sh file from terminal.\ncd /path/to/the/directory/which/contains/filename.sh\n\n\n*then run ls command to make sure that you are in correct directory(which contains .sh file).\n\n*Run the below command to make the .shfile as executable file.\nsudo chmod 777 filename.sh\n\n\n*Then type the below command to run the .sh file,\nsudo ./filename.sh \n\n", "Q: Changing Brightness on netbook I am using Asus Eee PC R051CX.

If your computer does not dectect them, you have to enter the BIOS and change that (Unless you have UEFI or EFI, but that is another case). If pressing F12 didn't show the BIOS menu, than there must be another key for that. The key that you press to access to the BIOS menu depends from machine to machine, in my CLEVO I have to press F7 or F2.

If not, what is the best way of proceeding?\n\nA: Including additional Apache modules is a great idea and seems like it could be very helpful in the core charm itself. What I'd recommend doing is implementing this via the config.yaml & hooks/config-changed so you could not only change what additional modules were installed but also add/remove modules on the fly.

Most of the time series will be the LTS name (precise, for example), charm would be \"apache2\", and the branch name can be anything, most people choose \"trunk\".

Also it would be good to keep my files but it's not absolutely necessary.\n\nA: My short recommendation: Do a complete low-level backup of your disk, and then dig up a Windows 8 recovery disc and use it on the original disk.\nThe long story: I see at least three things wrong with your current setup:\n\n\n*\n\n*Your /dev/sda2, which might once have been Windows, is identified as as \"unknown filesystem\" by the Boot Repair tool. This is Bad News, since this tool can normally identify the NTFS that's used by Windows. Maybe a Windows tool can repair the damage, but maybe not; and it's very unlikely that you'll get anywhere attempting to repair it in Linux.\n\n*Your EFI boot order is \"0003,2001\", but there's no obvious Windows boot entry. Boot entry 0003 is for Ubuntu (GRUB), and 2001 is for a USB flash drive. Thus, your computer will attempt to boot GRUB when it starts.\n\n*Your GRUB configuration includes no entry for Windows, so in conjunction with the previous item, even if your Windows volume could be read, you wouldn't be able to boot Windows. In theory, you could add a Windows entry to GRUB, but I'm doubtful that it would work, given the probable filesystem damage to /dev/sda2.\n\n\nThe first of these points is the most critical: Repairing NTFS is something that Linux just can't do. Thus, sooner or later you'll need to fire up a Windows repair tool, and it might as well be sooner rather than later. Attempting to put this off might yield results, but is more likely to be a waste of time; and even if it works, the results of getting the current Windows installation to boot and repair itself are not likely to be any better than the results you'd get from running a Windows repair disc.\nTry checking with Microsoft to find such a disc. I've heard that they exist and are fairly easy to find, but I don't happen to have any URLs handy.\n", "Q: Laptop fan always on in Ubuntu 12.10? I have dual booted Ubuntu 12.10 with Windows 7 on my Dell Inspiron 15r 3rd gen laptop. In Windows I have absolutely no problem with fan. But when I boot into Ubuntu after about a min the fan speed starts increasing & about 5mins later the fan is at extremely high speed. This is resulting lots electricity being sucked by the AC Adapter because it becomes extremely hot.\nI have ATI Radeon 7670m GPU. I dont know whether the CPU fan or the GPU fan is running. So I wanted to know whether it is possible to know the temperature of all the hardware like CPU, GPU, HDD, etc? So that I can understand which driver is having the problem.\nAny other mechanism to debug the cause of problem would also be very helpful.\nThank You.\n\nA: I use Jupiter:\nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:webupd8team/jupiter\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get install jupiter\n\nAfter installing that, just open the application. Use Performance in the applicaton menu and set to Power saving and you should almost immediately hear the fan slowing (if your temperature sensors don't sense a high temperature).\nIt also allows you to disable some devices and set screen resolutions, monitor settings, etc.\nUse lm-sensors to get an idea of the temperatures. \nsudo apt-get install lm-sensors\nsudo sensors-detect (say yes to all)\nsudo sensors\n\n", "Q: Make gcc coloring the default Is there a way to automatically make gcc color its output?\nI am looking to avoid an alias as the the command is commonly used in makefiles (where it will not be used).\nIs there an easy way to do this?\nNote: this does require gcc/g++ 4.9, which is currently available via svn.

However, Ubuntu tablets won't ship until the UI layer is folded into the fully unified Ubuntu 14.04 in the spring of 2014. Canonical expects to integrate a stable Ubuntu Phone with Ubuntu 13.10 (\"Saucy Salamander\") this October, making it available for Nexus 4 and Nexus Phone users, prior to a native Ubuntu-based phone launch in 1Q 2014.\nYou can see more informations at: http://www.linux.com/news/embedded-mobile/mobile-linux/702049-ubuntu-for-tablets-joins-canonicals-convergence-crusade\n\nA: Apparently it is out there for sale (in Europe) already, released a few hours slash days ago:\n\n\n*\n\n*http://www.engadget.com/2015/02/06/ubuntu-phone-launch/\n\n*http://www.pcadvisor.co.uk/news/mobile-phone/3503217/ubuntu-phone-release-date-price-specs/\n\n*http://www.bq.com/gb/products/aquaris-e4-5.html\n\n The all-new BQ Aquaris E4.5\n  \n  \n*\n  \n*Slots for two micro-SIM cards so you can use your phone on more than one network\n  \n*Dragontrail glass for scratch and impact resistance\n  \n*8 megapixel camera with autofocus and dual flash\n  \n*Full HD (1080p) camera for super-sharp video recording\n  \n*8 GB internal memory with MicroSD slot for extra storage (up to 32GB)\n  \n*Dimensions: 137 x 67 x 9 mm\n  \n*Weight: 123g\n  \n  \n  Only 169,90€\n\n\n\nA: Ubuntu tablets and phones most likely wont be shipping until early 2014 when ubuntu v14.04 is released. There should be a stable version by october if you are an advanced user of a nexus 10 and know how to unlock it so that you can follow the directions to flash it to your tablet. I hope this helps. This information was all from Ubuntu's site about their plans.\n\nA: Shuttleworth said earlier in February that devices running Ubuntu Touch will actually ship in October, but that seems unlikely now given that we have had no announcements of that sort to date... unless he has a surprise in store for us!\nMore realistically, a first-time consumer-ready version (lets say Ubuntu Touch v1.0) should be ready in October 2013 (and released along with Ubuntu 13.10 desktop version). The version for tablets and the overall phone-tablet-PC convergence features are not expected to arrive until April 2014 (when Ubuntu 14.04 LTS for desktops is released).\nAll of the above is my conclusion based on currently available information as of early August 2013. :)\n", "Q: Rhythmbox play no sound after changing output device Problem: Rhythmbox play no sound after changing output device.

In my opinion, because there is not just one scripting language (you were probably thinking of bash, but other shells exist), and also because the task a shell script has to accomplish is often very specific.\nActually, you can think of the set of gnu tools (sed, awk, grep, etc...) as a set of basic (or more complex) tools, which are distributed as deb packages...\nNevertheless, you can find some examples on the net, like the list on this blog post...\n\nA: Take a look at sparrow - this is a script distribution system for Linux platforms.\n", "Q: How can I make ascii-banners from the command line?

Due to the use of backticks, the output of cat is substituted in ps `cat` such that the command becomes ps 1000.\nAn alternative command that leads to the same result is:\nps $(xprop _NET_WM_PID | cut -d= -f2)\n\nThis works as follows:\n\n\n*\n\n*Execute xprop _NET_WM_PID to retrieve the process ID of a window.

I downloaded google-chrome for Linux, it got downloaded as a .deb file in downloads folder. I changed the current directory to the downloads folder and ran \"google-chrome\" in terminal. It started google chrome, but the issue is that .deb file is not a script(as I understand). Then how did the terminal understand that the 'google-chrome' command meant to start it? Commands like emacs...etc are already built-in. What about this command which is new to bash? How did it recognise it?\n\nA: First a few basics:\nWhen you run a command on your terminal, you enter the name of a file, (which should be executable): if you enter a simple name e.g. emacs, the system searches a number of directories for a file with such name. This list of directory is your PATH (i.e. it is stored in a variable named PATH). you can see its contents by typing echo $PATH. (As a side note, these commands are not built-in like you said in your question... but some are, for instance ls, which don't have any executable file, but is directly executed by the shell)\nAlternatively, you can enter a more complex filename, which include the directory :  /usr/bin/emacs, or event relative pathnames ! For instance, if you want to run the program in the file myprog, residing in your user directory, enter ./myprog (. meaning current directory)\nNow back to your question:\nWhen installing software, the system has to take care of putting everthing in the right place, so you can find it later on... It is what the package manager does : it takes an archive (.deb file), open it, and basically, put the files in the right places.\nIn conclusion, you have to open your .deb file with the package manager.\ncd ~/Downloads\ndpkg -i google-chrome.deb\n\nor, event better, install it through the software center.\n\nA: You probably already had google-chrome installed on your computer.\nA deb file contains all the necessary files to install it with dpgk (as root):\ndpkg -i <your-google-chrome-deb-file>.deb\n\ndpkg will copy binaries to you binary files location and then the command google-chrome will be available in your shell. If you didn't do this nor used an apt-get to install google chrome, I guess it means that google chrome was already present on your system.\nIf you want to see what the deb fils contains, you can use:\ndpkg --contents <file>.deb\n\n\nA: There are chromium and chrome if I'm not mistaken! It could be any one of those you already install.\n", "Q: How can i avoid downloading packages every-time I install my Ubuntu?

(like I did in Windows - The setup files... )\n\nA: You can create your own local repository.\nThe repository will be updated with the new packages from the internet periodically and you can use the repository to install new computers in your LAN. This will cause network-traffic but no internet-traffic during the installation and it is faster..\nRefer to https://help.ubuntu.com/community/AptGet/Offline/Repository\n\nA: You can install apt-cache-ng on one of your computers and setup apt to proxy into the apt-cache-ng server instead going to the Internet every time, the files are cached and delivered by the local computer. \nThe server can easily be installed with\nsudo apt-get install apt-cacher-ng\n\nThe client (i.e the machine being installed) can be set up by creating a file containing\nAcquire::http { Proxy \"http://CacheServerIp:3142\"; };\n\nin the directory\n/etc/apt/apt.conf.d\n\n\nA: I'm Noob. Just install APTonCD. This application will make backup on your updates pakages and you will be able to install it on other ubuntu. just my $0.02! Hope it help.\n\nA: Install squid-deb-proxy on one of your computers (which will then act as a package proxy server), and install squid-deb-proxy-client on the others. The clients will automatically detect the presence of a proxy server (using Avahi), and will load the packages from there; in case the clients are taken to a different network (which is often the case with laptops), they will automatically switch to direct download.\n", "Q: How do I install ORAC?

I have tried a lot but I guess I’m missing answers to some fundamental questions:\n\n\n*\n\n*Are there any rules regarding where to place the .qmltheme files and how to name them?\n\n*How is the reference done? Will the style rules I set in the .qmltheme file automatically append to the element that has the respective name set? Or do I have to somehow set a reference in the .qmltheme file to the file containing the QML-element, or the other way round, or both?\n\n\nMaybe I didn’t understand an important part of the documenation. English is not a native language of mine and therefore this specific documentation is hard to get for me. \n\nA: Unfortunately the documentation does not explain how applications should be themed, especially that this part is not fully implemented. However applications can still load theme files where they alter the system defined styles and specify their own ones.\n\n\n*\n\n*There is no specific rule where to put the application-specific theme file yet. However, it should be in a place the application knows and can access. The theme can be loaded using the Theme.loadTheme(url) function, where url is the URL/URI to the .qmltheme file. For example, assuming the theme file is in the \"theme\" folder relative to the application's folder, you should have Theme.loadTheme(Qt.resolvedUrl(\"./theme/mytheme.qmltheme\"))\n\n*I'm not sure I understand what you meant on \"reference\" in here. Do you refer to how a styled component will know which style to use, or you refer to how the QML-elements providing the visuals will be linked to the styled component?\n", "Q: How to have '~/.config/autostart' contents back? I had to erased all the contents of the folder /home/rgr/.config/autostart in the recovery mode in order to start the computer because of a video card change.\nIs there a way to have those contents back without having to reinstall all Xubuntu?\nNow that I am able to login the windows manager looks not to be working right.\n\nA: ~/.config/autostart is empty on a new session (Actually, this directory doesn't exist on a new account), and it does not contain any important scripts (i.e. the cause of your WM problem doesn't seems to be there)...\nApplications add startup scripts at this location (for instance, dropbox, bzr-notify, remmina-applet, ...) and of course you can add your own... The important autostart scripts (which are not user-dependant) live under /etc/xdg/autostart\n", "Q: When is it safe to remove my installation USB? I recently installed Ubuntu using a USB and was just wondering at what point can I remove the USB.\nIn other words, straight after the installation where it asks me to restart now, when I select restart now, can I remove my installation USB or do I need to leave plugged in until a later point in the process?\n\nA: Keep the USB Stick plugged in until the computer is shut down and restarts. Then you can unplug it to start from your HDD and not from the USB stick again.\nPull it out when the computer starts (BIOS Post; black screen, white letters) or shut the computer down and pull it out -- this way you're safe.\n", "Q: How can I create 3D molecule models like the link given in the body?  \nI've tried jmol but I would like the carbons to stand out as clearly as it does in this model and thus it would be great if I could use black for carbon, white for hydrogen, blue for nitrogen and red for oxygen. I am running 32 bit 12.10.\n\nA: I prefer VMD (link). You'll have to complete some license information in order to download, but its graphical user interface is easy to use and you have the most control over all the atoms and their properties.\nYou'll need to load the coordinates of the molecule and then change the representation. \n(If you don't want to go through the entire download/install process, consider Rasmol - link)\n", "Q: How to use ubuntu dash as online search engine? I want to know if online google search engine searches can be done from within ubuntu dash. \nThis is like a mini search engine within the ubuntu launcher.\nIf this is possible,how to do it?\n\nA: Yes, you can do this. Open your terminal and paste these lines one by one.\nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:scopes-packagers/ppa\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get install unity-lens-answers\n\nThen restart your computer for the changes to take effect.\n", "Q: Powerline fonts aren't working I have installed powerline and installed the Ubuntu Mono Powerline fonts and selected the font as the font to use in the terminal. The special characters still aren't working after installing the fonts. This is a default Ubuntu install using Gnome Terminal. I have also tried Konsole with no luck. Any other ideas on how to get this font working properly?\n\nA: Make sure that you are pointing VIM to the powerline bindings folder (it took me a while to understand that by just running the installer, this folder was still not avalailable). In my case I moved the powerline folder to /opt, so in my .vimrc I have a line that:\nset rtp+=/opt/powerline-develop/powerline/bindings/vim\n\nThe location of your powerling bindings folder is likely to be different\nI was unable to have the 10-powerline-symbols.conf recognized in my user folders (even after creating .font.conf.d so I ended up moving that to /etc/fonts/conf.d and run sudo dpkg-reconfigure fontconfig to have this new configuration file activated (and logged out and logged in).\nFor me that last step did the trick.\nOne thing you can do to see if all the other parts of the installation went well, is to select the powerline font itself inside vim (or gvim). Although the text will look unworkable, at the very least now the powerline should show the correct fonts. If they do not, then there is something else that needs fixing.\n\nA: Make sure your terminal encoding is set to UTF-8. It can be changed through the profile settings in  GNOME Terminal 3.14.2, but if you're using an older version which doesn't have this setting then you need to change your system locale to a UTF-8 locale.\n", "Q: Ubuntu installer not seeing free space on hard disk (dual boot) I'm trying to install Ubuntu (12.10) on a laptop on a 240 GB Intel SSD drive already containing a Windows 7 installation. I have the disk partitioned as follows:\n\n\n*\n\n*1500 MB, NTFS, system partition, something that the laptop came with\n\n*198 GB, NTFS, Windows installation partition\n\n\nThese partitions are followed by 23 GB of free space.\nThe Ubuntu installer, however, is not seeing the free space. Instead what I get in the Installation type dialog, is the following:\n\nI've already tried creating an unformatted primary partition in the free space (using Windows, obviously) but doing that didn't change the situation in any way.\nShould I alter the partitions in some way in order to make the free space accessible to the Ubuntu installer or am I missing something else here?\n\nA: You've almost certainly got a Windows Logical Disk Manager (LDM; aka \"dynamic disks\") setup. This is a Windows-specific system that's similar in some ways to the Linux Logical Volume Manager (LVM) system. Unfortunately, it's difficult (perhaps impossible) to install Linux on a disk that uses LDM.\nFortunately, it is possible to convert back from an LDM to a standard setup, but you'll need to use third-party utilities. EaseUS Partition Master and Partition Wizard are both supposed to be able to do this, IIRC. (Double-check this, though; my memory may be faulty, and I've never used either tool myself.) I recommend doing a complete backup before using either tool, since partitioning operations like this are inherently risky.\n", "Q: Ubuntu Version for Toshiba Satellite Model No.: C850-I0012 Which Ubuntu version does Toshiba Satellite Model No.: C850-I0012 support? Please provide me with the links to download drivers if any are required.\n\nA: Your computer is powerful enough to support the standard version of Ubuntu 64 bit.\nTest a liveDVD or liveUSB before installing.\n", "Q: Run single application with vnc I would like to run an application on a remote ubuntu machine using vnc. Currently I have to \n\n\n*\n\n*ssh into the remote machine and run x11vnc\n\n*Run vinagre locally\n\n*Start the application in the vinagre vnc window\n\n\nHow can I turn this into a single command line operation?  I can combine 1 and 2 into a bash script but how do I do 3 from the command line too?\n\nA: If you want a specific app in your vnc session, you can use vnc4server and edit .vnc/xstartup to start your application. But the shared desktop won't be your physical X11 display, but another (virtual) display.\nAn alternative would be to use ssh / X11 forwarding (ssh -X server) : any graphical application you launch is redirected to your local desktop.\n", "Q: Batch rename files to lowercase Is there a way to rename all files in a directory to lowercase|uppercase?\nI am looking for a oneliner command.\nI loved TotalCommander's Alt + F7, now I need that functionality in the Terminal.\n\nA: For each file a_file in current directory rename a_file to lower case.\nfor a_file in *;do mv -v \"$a_file\" `echo \"$a_file\" | tr [:upper:] [:lower:]` ;done;\n\nFor upper case reverse the arguments to [:lower:] [:upper:]\ntr command reference link \nUpdate\nFor even more control * can be replaced with ls. \nFor example in a directory containing 1.txt, 2.txt, 3.txt, 1.jpg, 2.jpg and 3.jpg in order to filter only *.jpg files, ls can be used:\nfor a_file in $(ls *.jpg);do mv -v $a_file `echo $a_file | tr [:upper:] [:lower:]` ;done;\n\nThe above code will assign to a_file variable all files with .jpg extension.\nUpdate added -v option to mv command as per sds suggested.\n\nA: There's a more elegant and general utility called prename.\nWritten by Larry Wall, it comes with perl so it is most likely already available on your system as /usr/bin/prename (if you have setup alternatives is may also be available as /usr/bin/rename symlinked via /etc/alternatives to prename)\nUsing it you can rename multiple files in one command by providing any perl expression (including but not limited to substitution s/// or char transliteration tr///):\nExamples:\n# Lowercase all *.JPG filenames:\nprename tr/A-Z/a-z/ *.JPG\n\n# Change any 'No' in a filename to a 'Yes':\nprename s/No/Yes/g *No*\n\n# increment first sequence of digits in a filename by 3:\nprename 's/([0-9]+)/$1+3/e' *[0-9]*\n\n# If a file contains 'aaa', append '.bak' to its name\nprename 'if (/aaa/) {$_ .= \".bak\"}'  *\n\nAnd so on.\nAnother nice thing about prename is that it protects you, in the case of renaming a file to an existing file name.\nman prename for more details.\n\nA: Using find\nfind . -name * -type f -exec rename 'y/A-Z/a-z/' '{}' \\;\n\nFor find\n\n\n*\n\n*Of course after -name put your pattern.\n\n*-maxdepth 0: Only current directory.\n\n\nFor rename\n\n\n*\n\n*-n, -nono: No action: print names of files to be renamed, but don't rename.\n\n*y/source/dest/: Transliterate the characters in the pattern space which appear in source to the corresponding character in dest.\n\n\nA: Using mmv to convert matched string to uppercase:\n$ mmv -r '*' '#u1'\n\nIts important to quote the pattern otherwise it will expand the wildcard instead.\n", "Q: Hard Disk Formatting Error so here is the situation..\nI

I'm making a summary of the history.log files in /var/log/apt. To that end, I want to remove lines containing a certain pattern as well as the line immediately preceding and the line immediately following the line containing the pattern.\nIn the following example:  \n 1  Start-Date: 2012-10-18  17:34:12\n 2  Commandline: /usr/sbin/synaptic\n 3  Install: qpdf:i386 (3.0.2-1)\n 4  End-Date: 2012-10-18  17:34:21\n\n 5  Start-Date: 2012-10-20  16:56:26\n 6  Commandline: apt-get upgrade\n 7  End-Date: 2012-10-20  16:56:39\n\n 8  Start-Date: 2012-10-24  09:15:11\n 9  Commandline: apt-get upgrade\n10  End-Date: 2012-10-24  09:15:26\n\n11  Start-Date: 2012-10-26  18:40:20\n12  Commandline: aptdaemon role='role-install-packages' sender=':1.196'\n13  Install: gcolor2:i386 (0.4-2.1ubuntu1)\n14  End-Date: 2012-10-26  18:40:31\n\n15  Start-Date: 2012-10-27  07:20:03\n16  Commandline: apt-get upgrade\n17  End-Date: 2012-10-27  07:20:11\n\n18  Start-Date: 2012-10-29  16:32:33\n19  Commandline: /usr/sbin/synaptic\n20  Install: policykit-desktop-privileges:i386 (0.12)\n21  End-Date: 2012-10-29  16:32:40\n\nI want to remove lines 5, 6, and 7, lines 8, 9, and 10 and lines 15, 16, and 17.\nAll I can manage is sed -rs ''/apt-get\\ upgrade/,+1'd;' which removes the line containing apt-get upgrade and the line following it.\n\nA: Ok, something ugly, but working:\npattern=\"apt-get\\ upgrade\"\nprog=\"BEGIN {b=0} /$pattern/ {print; b=1; next} {if (b==1) {b=0;next;} else {print;}}\"\ncat test | awk \"$prog\" | tac | awk \"$prog\" |tac | grep -v \"$pattern\"\n\nSecond line create a awk program that remove the line following the one where the pattern is found.\nThen this program is run on the test file, the output is reversed, the program run again, output is reversed, and line with pattern are removed.\nSomething shorter, with the same approach:\ncat test | sed -e \"/$pattern/{n;d}\" | tac | sed -e \"/$pattern/,+1d\" |tac\n\nI believe that reversing the file is mandatory, because to my knowledge, stream-processing tools cant go backward.\n\nA: It's not clear how general you want it, but an awk that does this specific task could be:\nawk 'BEGIN{ RS=\"\"; ORS=\"\\n\\n\"; } !/apt-get upgrade/' /var/log/apt/history.log\n\nyou can extend it with more patterns\nawk 'BEGIN{ RS=\"\"; ORS=\"\\n\\n\"; } !/apt-get upgrade/ && !/apt-get install hello/' /var/log/apt/history.log\n\nIt works by setting the record separator, RS (which is a newline by default), to the empty string.

I'm running Kubuntu and one of the features I've never found a use for is Activities. For the uninitiated, it lets you set up your desktops and applications based on the activity you're doing... Pretty smart stuff if you need or want it, but I don't.\nIt currently litters several context menus in and around the desktop and while that isn't causing me physical harm, I'd prefer it if KDE just pretended Activities never existed.\nIs there a way to disable Activities completely for a user (or globally)?\n\nA: Theoretically yes. For now it is not very easily done by a user. The KlyDE project is working on making this easier for any user. It will be able to be achieved, by either not installing the particular module of KDE, or by configuring settings.\n\nA: It is impossible to turn off activities. You are already using activities if you are using KDE Plasma. Your desktop, or virtual desktops, are an activity. By adding a new activity, you are creating another group of virtual desktops, just like the one you are now using. The global settings, like how many desktops there are in a group, carry over from one group to another. The technical details of what is allowed differs from distro to distro and, in my experience, Arch and Chakra have worked the best. openSUSE had all of the settings, but was somewhat unstable upon changing them. Some distros allow a different wallpaper on each desktop, and some do not. I did not like activities to begin with, as my previous comment will show. I urge you to play with them, because they really are useful. Like I said, you are already using them and just don't know it, but they can be removed from the panel if you insist. Trust me though, it is worth playing with them for a while. When you get used to it, you will be zooming around in an uncluttered environment in no time.\n\nA: The best I have been able to accomplish is removing them from the panel so that I don't get the notion to play with them anymore. I like the idea, but every time I try to set them up differently, I end up losing most or all of my settings from my original desktop. I'm sure it's my fault, but it should be harder to screw things up that badly. Just add more virtual desktops and avoid the frustration and loss of time. Maybe it will be better in Plasma 5! I do love the KDE experience, with this one small exception. Maybe some explicit directions on what to avoid could be offered in a popup during setup.\n\nA: For me it was enought to disable global shortcuts as I use Meta+Q and Meta+S for other purposes:\n\n\n*\n\n*launch \"Global (Keyboard) Shortcuts\",\n\n*navigate to \"KWin\" component,\n\n*search for \"activi\"\n\n*and disable 3 shortcuts.\n\n\nA: Well, you can't disable activities but... What I've done is; using the shortcut setting I erased all the shortcut that are using activities the net effect of that is that you have only the default activity but is transparent because you cannot access to the activity bar or change to other activity so... it's disabled in practice\n", "Q: How to mount ubuntu share on other ubuntu machine?

It would not work if you used some other type of file sharing method, like NFS, but I believe the default method privileged by Ubuntu on the desktop is Samba.\nMaybe your Ubuntu machine is not announcing its hostname on your network, and that is why you would not be able to access your shares list when typing //ubuntu_machine. You may want to try using your Ubuntu machine's IP address.

The HDD is password protected and when I connect it on my PC, it just shows up the CD icon on the launcher. It works perfectly with Windows XP and Windows 7. Ii is preloaded with the password software - Utility_HD-PXTU, so whenever I connect it it first asks for the password. But in Ubuntu it is showing \nunable to mount Utility_HD-PXTU\nError mounting: mount: /dev/sr2 already mounted or /media/Utility_HD-PXTU busy\n\nand when I click on the CD icon it open a folder with some files on it\nError mounting: mount: block device /dev/sr2 is write-protected, mounting read-only\nmount: wrong fs type, bad option, bad superblock on /dev/sr2,\n       missing codepage or helper program, or other error\n       In some cases useful info is found in syslog - try\n       dmesg | tail  or so\n\n\nA: From what I could gather from the Internet, Buffalo uses proprietary software that runs on Windows to encrypt the hard drive.   It won't work with Ubuntu or any non-windows operating system.\nAs @mitch says in comments you have to remove the password and encryption using Buffalo's Secure Lock Manager. An unencrypted drive will work in both Windows and Ubuntu. \nIf you want to encrypt some files that you will only use in Windows, see Secure Lock Manager documentation on how to encrypt a part of the hard drive. This part will not be available to Ubuntu, but at least you will be able to use a part of the hard drive in Ubuntu.\nHope this helps\n\nA: I had similar problem with WD HDD. WD Software does not work on Linux.\nWhat I did: I removed password and I access it normally from Windows as well from Linux.\n However now you need to encrypt files that are stored on external drive:\nI suggest using 7z. In manual you have example how to do it:\n On Linux/Unix, in order to backup directories you must use tar :\n        - to backup a directory  : \n\n\ntar cf - directory | 7za a -si directory.tar.7z\n\n\nYou just need to add -p flag to make it password protected.\nI hope it will give you some clues how to proceed.\n\nA: Encrypted Buffalo HDDs only work with Windows OS.

Default KDE is not running good on my PC and it's too slow.\nI switched to Unity-2D and it's better.\nWanted to ask if there is a more simple, lighter KDE that would work better on my PC.\n\nA: I would definitely recommend installing the \"kubuntu-low-fat-settings\", which removes a lot from the default kubuntu-desktop installation. KDE will be much lighter after that.\nHowever the low-fat-settings may also remove some thing which you need. \nSome of which are:\n\n\n*\n\n*Turns off compositing by default\n\n*Reduces the number of Krunner plugins loaded by default\n\n*Reduce the amount of effects used in the window decoration\n\n*Disables the automatic loading of various system modules – such as\nthe free space notifier, Nepomuk services, and others\n\n\nSee this article for more info:\nhttp://www.omgubuntu.co.uk/2011/09/kubuntu-low-fat-settings-speed-boost-older-hardware\nRAM and CPU/GPU usage will be dramatically reduced by installing this package\nTo install the package simply run this command:\nsudo apt-get install kubuntu-low-fat-settings\n\n\nA: Yes you do have an option here.\nIf you install  kde-plasma-desktop then it will gives only core of KDE and nothing else.That is the final possible light weight KDE you can get.\nto install that open your terminal and type as\nsudo apt-get install kde-plasma-desktop\n\nThen from the log-in screen you can choose your Session.\nFor more information Ubuntu-KDE\nEdit: kde-plasma-desktop is just plasma-desktop in 16.04.\n\nA: Maybe you are interested in Razor-Qt. It's not KDE, but a very lightweight desktop based on Qt, the same framework KDE is based on.\nNote that it has a more lightweight approach than Xfce for example, which can be good or bad, depending on what your needs are.\nYou can install it via PPA:\n\n\n*\n\n*sudo add-apt-repository ppa:razor-qt/ppa\n\n*sudo apt-get update\n\n*sudo apt-get install razorqt\n", "Q: Where can I find the python Tools directory?

With lots of guides and setup variations all over the internet, I find it confusing which is which to really follow. Normally, in Windows 8 my setup would be install everything in the HDD and use Intel Smart Response for a speedy setup. However as I am new to Linux I really don't know what to do.\nMy ideal setup would be something similar to this, but I know for a fact that IRST is not available in Linux so what I intend to do is keep the OS files in the SSD instead and keep my media on the larger HDD. A step by step procedure would be extremely helpful. \n\nEdit: I want a system running solely on Ubuntu, with the SSD to speed things up but setting it in such a way that it does not hasten its lifespan.\n\n# /etc/fstab: static file system information. \n#\n# Use 'blkid' to print the universally unique identifier for a \n# device; this may be used with UUID= as a more robust way to name devices \n# that works even if disks are added and removed. See fstab(5). \n# \n# <file system> <mount point> <type> <options> <dump> <pass>\n\n# / was on /dev/sda1 during installation \nUUID=80289460-5983-4349-8afc-6f3119938ee9 / ext4 errors=remount-ro 0 1 \n\n# /files was on /dev/sdb5 during installation \nUUID=c1678c88-5100-41bc-8090-7887f1622c7f /files ext4 defaults 0 2 \n\n# swap was on /dev/sdb6 during installation \nUUID=608e3ec2-c76e-4657-af6d-80793b5f50f6 none swap sw 0 0\n\n\nA: Short answer: just put the entire filesystem, including home directories, on the SSD, and just mount the HDD somewhere that you can get to it easily, for big files (movies/music/photos, etc).\nSSD life\nFirstly, you don't need to worry about lifespan with a modern SSD.  It'll have a much higher lifetime than an HDD.  Even if you write to it heavily, gigabytes or millions of files per day, it'll last decades.  Its heads won't crash and it won't be affected by vibration, change in temperature etc like hard drives are.  Wear-levelling ensures that you can write to it heavily for many years.  (That said, don't do something silly and go without backups.)\nWhat benefits most from an SSD\nFor ensuring a fast system, the most important parts of your filesystem are, in order:\n\n\n*\n\n*Home directories.  This is where your browser caches, thumbnail caches, desktop configuration and so on is stored.  This is very frequently read from and written to, so it should be on the SSD - in fact this is the most important part of the system to be on an SSD.\n\n*/tmp and /var directory.  These are fairly frequently written to, but less so than the above.  You can use tmpfs for /tmp if you like, but I put both of them on the SSD.\n\n*/etc and /usr.  These are rarely written to but fairly often read from, and will contribute to a faster boot, among other things, if they're on the SSD.\nMy advice\nWhat I do is simply put the entire root filesystem on the SSD, and mount the HDD under a mount point like /drives/BIGDRIVE (you can use /mnt/BIGDRIVE if you like as many people do; I prefer to use a non-standard directory like /drives over using a standard directory like /mnt for other than its intended purpose).\nThen, I symlink into directories on /drives/BIGDRIVE from my home directory.  For example, /home/myuser/Data is a symlink into /drives/BIGDRIVE/Data/myuser and /home/myuser/Media is a symlink into /drives/BIGDRIVE/Media.  The symlinks to a separate location allow me to later modify the directory structures of the mount points (say, if I wanted to separate media onto a new drive) but keep the same directory structure in my home directory.  I use all-caps for the name of the drive's mount point, don't ask me why.\nP.S. I do this on Windows (including Windows 8) too.  It is still superior to have the SSD as the system drive and just mount the HDD as D:, instead of using Intel Smart Response or similar.\n\nA: Update\nThere are other alternatives, bcache, flashcache, dm-cache, EnhanceIO etc. that allow Ubuntu to use a small SSD and a large HDD in ways similar to Windows. See\nWhat are the advantages/disadvantages of different SSD to HDD cacheing options (dm-cache, flashcashe...)? for differences between these. \nI have no experience with these tools. See How do I install and use flashcache/bcache to cache HDD to SSD? and ArchLinux Wiki on Bcache for more on some of these methods. Thanks to Fabby for pointing me to these resources.\n\nOriginal Answer\nYou are right. The way Windows 8 uses a small SSD and a large HDD is not available to Ubuntu. \nKeeping Ubuntu OS in the SSD and the media in HHD makes sense. The /home folder (or partition) usually keeps all the media, documents, for all the users. It also keeps all the user-specific configuration files. So keeping the /home on the SSD will speed up things as the configuration files will be read quickly. \nStep 1\nDisable Intel Smart Response in BIOS/UEFI. Disable Secure Boot and Fast  Boot. Enable Legacy Mode in BIOS if available.\nStep 2\nBoot from a Live DVD/USB of the version of Ubuntu you want to install and choose \"Try Ubuntu.\"  Make sure keyboard, mouse/trackpad, display, sound, Internet connections, webcam and any other things you can think off work in Ubuntu. \nStep 3\nInstall Ubuntu in the SSD. If Legacy Mode in BIOS could not be enabled, see Ubuntu UEFI documentation on how to install. For someone new, it is easier to just have one / ext4 formatted partition with mount point / in the SSD. You can create a second /home partition in the SSD if you want, but that is not essential. \nWhen you get to the point where you have to choose where to install(“Installation Type”),\n\nchoose “Something Else”. A new screen will pop out letting you choose where to install Ubuntu, format, make partitions, etc.  Follow carefully the bellow:\n\n\n*\n\n*Choose and format the smaller disk (SSD) as ext4 and mount point / to install Ubuntu \n\n*Choose and format the bigger disk (HDD) ext4 to just store media. Assign it a mount point /bigdrive. Alternately assign mount point /mnt/bigdriveor /media/bigdrive. See Why have both /mnt and /media? for more explanations on these alternates. If you use either of the alternates, modify following steps accordingly.\n\n*Create a Swap partition at the end of the HDD and assign it the\nSwap format. It does not need any mount-point.\n\n*Finish install and reboot.\n\n\nStep 4\nVerify: \n\n\n*\n\n*Ubuntu boots correctly.\n\n*Everything works as they did when you tried Ubuntu from the Live\nDVD/USB.\n\n*Open Nautilus, the file manager (similar to Windows Explorer) and\nnavigate to File Systems. Verify the folder bigdrive exists.\nIf you can't find bigdrive then it did not get mounted at startup.\nSee\nmount two hard drives on start up\nhow to fix that.\n\n*Create a new folder and a new file in it to see you can actually\nwrite in the bigdrive. Delete these.\n\n\nIf you cannot create folders and files in the bigdrive follow these steps to fix the write permission. \n\n\n*\n\n*Open terminal by pressing Ctrl+Alt+T\nand type\ngksudo nautilus \nIf this does not work, see How do I start Nautilus as root?\n\n\n*\n\n*Enter your password at the prompt. \n\n*Within Nautilus, go to File System and find the bigdrive folder\nicon.\n\n*Right click on and choose Properties.\n\n*Go to the Permissions tab.\n\n*Make sure the Group and Others can  Create and Delete\nFiles.\n\nStep 5\n\n\n*\n\n*Move the big folders in your /home/$USER folder to /bigdrive/$USER.\nYou can do this in Nautilus using \"Create New Folder\" (for creating the user folder), \"Cut\" and \"Paste\" (for the directories). Let's say these folders\nare:\n~/bin, ~/Desktop, ~/Documents, ~/Downloads, ~/Music, ~/Pictures, ~/Public, ~/Templates and ~/Videos\n\n*Make symbolic links. Open a Terminal by pressing\nCtrl+Alt+T and type each line and\npress Enter: (replace \"$USER\" by your user name)\nln -s /bigdrive/$USER/bin/ bin\nln -s /bigdrive/$USER/Desktop/ Desktop\nln -s /bigdrive/$USER/Documents/ Documents\nln -s /bigdrive/$USER/Downloads/ Downloads\nln -s /bigdrive/$USER/Music/ Music\nln -s /bigdrive/$USER/Pictures/ Pictures\nln -s /bigdrive/$USER/Public/ Public \nln -s /bigdrive/$USER/Templates/ Templates \nln -s /bigdrive/$USER/Videos/ Videos\nMore details are at Installing Ubuntu on Samsung 5 (SSD+HDD)\nHope this helps\n\nA: \nIRST is not available in Linux\n\nThere are alternatives such as bcache.\nSee How do I install and use flashcache/bcache to cache HDD to SSD?\n", "Q: Ubuntu 12.10 segmentation faults, damaged crash reports, random letters changing in files I have Ubuntu 12.10, on an SSD (OCZ Agility 3 128GB), with a modestly overclocked i5-2500k (4.4GHz) on motherboard P8Z68V_LX.

The wireless also works perfectly with my school's wifi, but when connecting to my home wifi, I have no internet access.\nCannot ping google.com and iwconfig states \"no wireless extensions\".\nThanks\n\nA: Besides not having the proper password entered for your home network, the other slightly-more-remote answers could be that:\n\n\n*\n\n*your home wifi is using an unsupported WEP authentication method. WPA and WPA2 are the commonly supported protocols;\n\n*your wifi connection on the laptop is using a fixed IP address that is not in the same IP range as your home network.

I'll look that up in a moment), or, more likely, there are extra characters (spaces, or otherwise nor printable characters) after the final extension. e.g. \"PL.234234.gnucash \" (note the space there) or some such.\ntry:\nls *.gnucash*\n\nto see if you can list those files.

The second command returns information on all FAT partitions on your computer. The ESP is supposed to be a FAT partition, so you should see some correlations. For instance, here's what I get when I issue these commands on one of my systems:\n$ grep efi /etc/fstab\n# /boot/efi was on /dev/sda2 during installation\nUUID=502D-EB63  /boot/efi       vfat    defaults        0       1\n$ sudo blkid | grep fat\n/dev/sda2: SEC_TYPE=\"msdos\" LABEL=\"ESP_FAT16\" UUID=\"502D-EB63\" TYPE=\"vfat\"\n\nNote that some systems might return information on two or more FAT partitions from blkid. In such cases, you'll need to figure out which one is your ESP by examining the partition table with gdisk, parted, GParted, or some other partitioning tool. There may be other complications, too, on some systems.\nFrom here, you can look for problems. Pay particular attention to the UUID= values in both outputs. If they don't match, that's the source of the problem. If this is the case, editing /etc/fstab so that it refers to the ESP by its correct filesystem \"UUID\" (really just a serial number for FAT) should get things working.\nAnother possible problem won't show up as a discrepancy in the analysis you've just performed, since it's a matter of a filesystem needing repair. You can do this with the dosfsck utility:\nsudo dosfsck /dev/sda2\n\nYou must pass it the device filename associated with the ESP -- /dev/sda2 in this example, as revealed by the blkid output. After making this repair, the problem should go away, with the caveat that very serious filesystem damage may require more drastic measures, such as backing up the ESP, creating a fresh FAT filesystem on the partition, restoring the data, and adjusting /etc/fstab to use the new \"UUID\" value.\nOne more point along these lines: If you're dual-booting with Windows 8, it includes a \"fast startup\" feature that is basically just a suspend-to-disk feature. Sharing partitions between Windows and Linux with this feature active is almost certain to lead to problems, and I've heard of the ESP being affected by this. Thus, if you're dual-booting with Windows 8, you should disable the fast startup feature. This page describes how to do this in detail.\n\nA: I was completely lazy and booted a Ubuntu live disk..... once the disk loaded up a desktop, I ran gparted.. I saw that my boot partition /dev/sda1 ext4 with a mount point / had a uuid that looked like a hardware uuid 5465465406546506540d546sd54f66 something like that. (that was a clue to me that.. this was the damaged portion when i had to hard boot when my machine locked up).. I right clicked on said partition made sure it was unmounted and selected check.... thus gparted checked and repaired the partition..... restarted and everything loaded up great... I'm sure it wont work for all cases but it worked for me\n", "Q: Is there a virus active in my Ubuntu? I m Using Ubuntu 13.04. Whenever I insert any external memory card or pan drive, a new folder Trash is generated there, which uses huge space of it..\nThe most important thing is that it is not visible in Ubuntu. It can be seen in windows though.\nPlease tell how to remove this bug.\n\nA: Not a virus. It's hidden from nautilus (default Unity GUI filesystem browser) by default. It's visible when you navigate using Terminal (do ls -h to include hidden files when listing). \nIt's a directory where files are put when you delete it via GUI, so you can restore files when they are deleted this way, but not when you do it via Terminal (i.e. rm $FILE or rm -r $DIRECTORY; they're essentially gone forever). \nRead How to prevent Ubuntu from creating a .Trash-1000 folder when deleting files from a USB flashdrive? for more information about the .Trash-1000 folder and how to stop it from being created.\nIn summary, the link I included mentions:\n\nDon't use the Delete button only (Otherwise the .Trash-1000 folder\n  will be created)\nPress the key combination Shift + Delete together to delete then Ubuntu\n  won't create a .Trash-1000 folder. \n(Note: If you delete files and folders this way they are gone forever!)\n\nYou can safely remove .Trash-1000, preferably via Terminal (run rm -rf .Trash-1000).\n", "Q: Ubuntu iMessage Client Are there any chat clients or stand-alone clients that can interact with the iMessage server? I just switched from OSX 10.8.x to Ubuntu 12.10, and it's really the only thing I miss.\n\nA: Well you can't directly, but there are roundabout ways.  \nHere are two:\nBoth require an iDevice though. So no, you cant do what you wish, but you can send info from your PC, and have it delivered to your iDevice, and then it sends it.  both methods require a jailbroken iDevice.\n\n\n*\n\n*SSH.  You can SSH into your iDevice with putty or something, then send the messages via terminal.\n\n*Remote messages:  Just install the cydia app, then open your web browser, and type in your idevices ip address, followed by a port number (example: http://192.168.1.3:333/ ).  This will work on any platform, even your phone.  You can take it a step further by enabling port forwarding, so you can access a device halfway around the world.\nOthers:\nYou can always send text messages.  Try using curl.  Here's a line (If I remember it correctly)\ncurl http://textbelt.com/text -d number=9876543210 -d \"message=put your message here\"\n\nThere are other messaging tools available as well.  If your a hacker/prankster, you can try SET (social engineering tool).  \nI'm sorry for not being able to supply you with a solution, only alternatives.\n\nA: This message is quoted from https://apple.stackexchange.com/a/66047:\niMessage is based on a propietary, binary and encrypted protocol (source Wikipedia) with a client side device certificate, which makes it unlikely to be reverse engineered and implemented in third party apps any time soon (although attempts are being made).\n\nEdit\nIt may be possible in the future to run the native OS X applications on a Linux OS similar to how we can run Windows applications using wine's compatibility layers. The Darling Project aims to do that. However, I have never encountered a situation where I needed to run a native mac application, so I have never tested it. This does seem promising, though somewhat doubtful. The following is quoted from wikipedia:\nJust like APNS it sets up a Keep-Alive connection with the Apple servers. Every connection has its own unique code, which acts as an identifier for the route that should be used to send a message to a specific device. The connection is encrypted with TLS using a client side certificate, that is requested by the device on the activation of iMessage.\n", "Q: Surface Pro unknown filesystem all solutions I found depend on a live CD, but my surface won't boot into live USB and I can't figure out how to access UEFI.\nEvery time I start my Surface, it says\nerror: unknown filesystem.\ngrub rescue> _\n\nHow do I get back into Windows?\nI still have the full Windows partition in it (I think hd0,gp3), if that helps you with your answer.\n\nA: After talking with both Linux and Windows professionals, we decided there's only one way to fix this. You must perform a hard reset. The steps to do this are listed below, and good timing is crucial. Note that this requires you not remove the recovery partition. if you've removed the recovery partition, then the only option is to send your Surface in for \"repair\".\n\n\n*\n\n*Turn on the Surface and let Grub start\n\n*Hold down the power/lock button for 10 seconds and release it to ensure all power throughout the device is cut.\n\n*Hold the power button for 10 seconds\n\n*While still holding the power button, hold the volume down button for another 7 seconds, then release both simultaneously\n\n*You should see the Surface logo with the \"loading\" chasing dots animation below it.\n\n*\n\n*If you have still booted back into Grub, then you haven't gotten the timing down. Return to step 1 and repeat.\n\n\n*You should be presented with the Windows Advanced Boot interface. This works with touch, mouse, or keyboard, so proceed as you wish.\n\n*The interface may vary by which generation Surface you have, but you should see a selection of installed OSs (in my case, just Windows 8 Pro). Select Windows 8 Pro.\n\n*Navigate to Advanced Settings, and then Reset or Refresh your device\n\n*\n\n*Reset will restore everything to factory settings.\n\n*Refresh will restore everything to factory settings except the User directory, and will preserve Windows 8 Modern (AKA Metro) apps. If you choose this, all traditional Windows programs will be wiped and a list of which ones were removed (and usually where to download them) will be placed on your desktop as an HTML file.\n\n\n\nYou'll be booted back into Windows and all semblance of Grub will be gone :3\n", "Q: How to call php or apache to render a page from the command line? I am running apache2 as a web server. I have a local file, example.php, which I need to see as rendered by apache. The easiest way to do this would be to move or link the file to the folder apache exposes as part of my site, and then I could get the page with curl or wget.\nHowever, this is not possible in my situation - I cannot write to the directory apache is looking in, which means that I can't access it by the usual port 80 method. Is there a way I can call apache directly, giving it a php file to generate the result of?\nI'm looking for a command like $ apache ./example.php > output.html, is this possible?\nI'm asking about apache, because although I only really need it to run the php, the php-cli is not usable in this cases - apache php and cli php have access to different areas of memory, and I need the results to match the ones returned through apache.\n\nA: Can you just add it to Apache as a new virtualhost?\nThe simplest way to get something to behave like a website is to treat it like a website. If you could just host this as a local website (eg only on the 127.0.0.1 interface) and wget it, that would probably be the cheapest and cleanest way to deal with this.\nRun it as a script with the php command\nYou can run php example.php > output.html and that should work for most simple scripts.\nNote that this will use the php-cli configuration rather than mod_php, php-fpm, php-cgi, etc configurations. That might be important if you have a funny setup.\nEdit: I saw this question yesterday that might be of use. It's aimed at wordpress but the same logic should apply for most things where you need to fake a real request. You set up a load of PHP's $_SERVER variables so your script (whatever that might be) can execute correctly… And then include your script.\nUse the PHP built-in server (requires PHP 5.4+)\nIf you cd into your directory and run php -S localhost:9000 you start a local server on port 9000 that will host your website. This is only for testing things like this and should never be exposed to the internet.\nThis allows you to do a traditional wget lookup:\nwget -O output.html http://localhost:9000/example.php\n\nFrom my previous (now deleted) answer, if you find yourself needing to spoof the domain name, wget will let you pass the host in. This comes in handy if the PHP is doing lookups on server variables.\nwget -O output.html --header \"Host: example.com\" http://localhost:9000/example.php\n\n", "Q: Grub fails to boot windows 7, no such partiton error My dual-boot windows 7 / ubuntu 12.04 has been working fine for months, but suddenly i'm unable to boot to windows. i've tried fixing this using boot-repair (i.e. purging and reinstalling grub), but to no avail. \nBootinfo is at http://paste.ubuntu.com/5719132\nThe specific error i get from grub when attempting to boot windows is:\nerror: no such device 98E09BBAE09B9CD6\nerror: no such partition\n\nI've reviewed many similar posts which appear to have been resolved via boot-repair, but again, i've run that several times to no effect.\nAny help much appreciated!\n\nA: Try to reinstall grub:\nsudo grub-install\n\nWhen using the grub-install command, the boot information is updated and written to the designated drive, missing - but not corrupted or intentionally deleted - files are restored. Specifically the core.img, grubenv, and device.map are updated and missing modules restored. If missing, the grub folder will be recreated. \nThe grub-install command does not generate a new GRUB 2 menu (grub.cfg). For this you may run also and this command:\nsudo update-grub\n\n\nA: try the following command:\nsudo update-grubNormally it should work...\n\nA: It's odd that reinstalling grub didn't work. Your Windows distribution shows up on the Grub menu but you get errors when you select it. The only idea I have is to manually add another entry for your windows distribution to the grub menu. Having perused through the Grub 2 tutorial, I think it can be accomplished by doing the following:\nNavigate to the /etc/grub.d/ directory and create a new file. The name of the new file should be something like 25_Windows_7. The directory /etc/grub.d contains scripts for adding new items to your grub menu. The order in which these scripts add items to the menu are determined by the number at the beginning of the name. In the file write:\n #!/bin/sh -e\n echo \"Adding Windows 7 to GRUB 2 menu\"\n cat << EOF\n menuentry \"Windows 7\" {\n set root=(hd0,1)\n chainloader (hd0,1)+1\n }\n EOF \n\nreplace the occurrences of (hd0,1) with the partition of your windows distribution. I.E. if its sda4 then you would write (hd0,4).\nMake the file executable by chmod +x 25_Windows_7.\nNow when you run update-grub this new menu item should appear in Grub2's menu.\nI have no idea if I even explained it right, but the Grub 2 tutorial can be found here.\n\nA: From my experience and from what I read above, I think it has to do with BIOS settings: I have experienced the same problem today, after a power failure; A BIOS boot mode configuration reverted from \"Normal Boot\" to \"Fast Boot\" and the problem showed until I changed it back to \"Normal Boot\" in the BIOS to solve it.\n", "Q: How to change boot screen name?

I'm working on Eclipse Indigo on Ubuntu 12.04.\nI'm trying to completely uninstall Eclipse (with Synaptic Package Manager + Mark for complete removal), but when I reinstall it, I clearly see that it has kept all parameters, and history, which is what I'm trying to get rid of.\nI also tried the following.\nsudo apt-get purge eclipse\nrm -r ~/.eclipse/\n\nAs suggested here, no luck either.\n\nA: You were almost done. Add an asterisk (*) at the end of eclipse word.\nsudo apt-get autoremove eclipse*\nrm -r ~/.eclipse/\n\nToday I have encountered the same problem and searched for a solution. I have seen this question. I have tried the same steps but failed. Then a friend of mine used those commands above. \nIt removed all about eclipse.\n\nA: Run following commands:\nsudo apt-get autoremove eclipse*\nrm -r ~/.eclipse/\n\nThis will uninstall the dependencies and related packages that were installed along with eclipse. This should do the trick.\nsudo snap remove eclipse\n\n\nA: I would look in the /etc, /usr, and /var directories for any files that may be related to Eclipse. Using the Synaptic or other package managers will only remove files that were part of the installation, not any of the settings files that Eclipse may have made when used.\n\nA: I tried many of the suggested solutions and kept coming up with similar results. Eventually fired up software centre and found that it was registering Elipse as installed. So I installed it through software centre and the process overwrote what was installed already ( probably because I installed via command line).\nThen fired up synaptics package manager, did a search for eclipse while sorting by \"installed version\" column. Selected all dependent packages and marked them for complete removal. That did the trick.\n\nA: First remove eclipse:\nCTRL+ALT+T, opens up the terminal. Type in sudo apt-get autoremove eclipse.\nNow, type in cd / which will put you in the \"File System\" directory. Next you type gksu nautilus and it will ask you for your password. When you type it in, the File System folder (with all privileges) will pop out. From there you click the search button, type in eclipse, wait for everything to be found and simply delete everything it found. \nThen you can go to Ubuntu Software Center and install fresh version of eclipse and add your new packages from synaptic.\n\nA: I just ran into the same problem today, and managed to solve it with :\nsudo apt-get purge eclipse*\nrm -r ~/.eclipse/\n\n(Just add a '*' after eclipse)\nEclipse is in fact installed as a bunch of different packages, which names all starts with 'eclipse' ; so this should indeed remove all your previous configuration\n\nA: sudo apt-get autoremove eclipse --purge\n\nA: Using synaptic package manager download \"gtkorphan\",it will remove your config and a lot of other orphaned packages.After download look in your dash home for Remove Orphaned Packages.I use it religiously to clean up my 12.04 system as well.\n", "Q: Ubuntu 12.10 Gnome 3 Login Screen Bad position Operating System and Config:\nI have Ubuntu 12.10 with Unity removed and installed Gnome 3 desktop.\nEverything works fine but...\nWhen I turn on PC for the first time and Gnome loads the login screen, it is kinda aside not in center.

For a school project I need to collaborate with a lot of different people, and they all use MS Office. Of course they all have problems with opening .odt files. (even though MS says that Office should open them just fine..). They all get messages that the file is corrupt. Normally they can recover the content, but with messed up formatting. \nSo I was wondering.. what file format is the most compatible with Microsoft Word? Also another thing I wondered for a while.. I saw that there are two options for .docx when I save a new document, Office Open XML and Office 2007/2010 or something. Which of the 2 should I use?\nHopefully someone is able to help out! :)\n\nA: For various reasons, Microsoft does not play well with others. Your best option is to save your content in a Microsoft Office format. Try saving a test document in doc, docx, other MS options available, and have someone in your group see which one works best for them. \n\nA: your best option for working with libre office and MS office is to save your documents as a rich text format, i use both Ubuntu and Windows (Libreoffice and MS office) files i have created on MS office are saved as a RTF (rich text format) i can then edit them on Ubuntu and then open and edit them on Windows\n\nA: I have found saving my libre office docs in the older ms word 97 format works best, it gives the .doc extension instead of the 2007 .docx extension.\nsame thing with powerpoint ppt instead of the pptx\nin libre office I set the options to save in that format by default.\nI have ms office 2007 at work and don't seem to have a problem going back and forth with the 72/2003 formats \n\nA: From being semi-active in the LibreOffice support areas, I have seen numerous references to .docx, .pptx and .xlsx (the MS Office 2007+ versions) having a few problems currently, and that for best collaboration with MS users, the original formats (.doc, .xls, .ppt) should be used, as the exporting techniques used provide greater compatibility than .docx, .etc and .odt, .etc for MS Office.\nODT support in MS Office will never be perfect, partly because Microsoft want people to use their formats, therefore tying them into their platform to get the best compatibility, and even if people don't like it, Microsoft are a business trying to make money, unlike The Document Foundation (who make LibreOffice) who are a non-profit, trying to promote open standards and supply a great Office Suite.\nDisclaimer: I am a volunteer at LibreOffice, but the above text is not influenced by my time there.\n\nA: There'll never play along, my suggestion is, if you have to use MS Office for work, USE IT, don't waste your time and energy, I tried once and never worked out. Play on Linux can run Office 2007 with some limitations.\nIf the documents are simple text documents (Single page), in LibreOffice use .doc format, and avoid anything else but arial 10. Don't use tables or images too complex.\nYou could try also using Google Docs or Office Web Apps for collaborative work.\n\nA: If you've ever install fonts from Windows to Ubuntu, try using Office Open Document, then try open in your MS Office. Note some fonts aren't recognized in Windows, so try install Windows Fonts.\n\nA: i had the same problem as you with MS OFFICE, the first thing i did was to save my files using the options that libreoffice give us but i found that when i wanted to open it in ms office my file did not work properly so, I recomend you to try out these 2 things:\n1-go to Ubuntu Software Centre and install PLAYONLINUX and then install MS OFFICE in your ubuntu but first you must have the MS OFFICE SOFTWARE with extention .EXE. \n2- Go to:http://www.libreoffice.org/download en download the libreoffice for WINDOWS and with extension .EXE and enjoy what libreoffice can do for you. \nI tried out every trick possible in the world to get compatibility between libreoffice and ms office and it was a waste of time so, I recommend you the 2 option I just gave you because all my problems were solved by this way. \nhope it works for you too. \n", "Q: How to resolve Perl module error while trying to run NGS QC Toolkit?

I want to have my page numbers in LibreOffice Impress to be in Persian.\nWhich means ۰۱۲۳۴۵۶۷۸۹ instead of 0123456789.\n\nA: tools-> options -> languages settings -> complex text layout \ngeneral options set it to hindi \nand here's a screen shot of it\n\n\nA: These settings work across all LibreOffice applications and documents, so you can make changes from any of the set of applications. \nChanging the locale\nYou can set Persian as the default for all of your documents or for the current document only.\nFrom the menu bar, Tools >> Options, then expand the Language Settings and click Languages\n\nChange Locale to Farsi. (Note that this is independent of the setting for the user interface above.)\nChange CTL to Default - Farsi. This will also automatically check Enabled for complex text layout (CTL) below. CTL handles right-to-left languages.\nCheck For the current document only according to your prefrence.\nChanging the global numeral style\nClick on Complex Text Layout on the left side of the dialog and change numerals to Hindi. (not shown in this screenshot)\nUse Insert >> Page Number to show the Header/Footer dialog in order to add page numbers to your slides. \nSetting numerals to Hindi in the Language Settings lets you use \"Arabic\" numbers without using an input method editor such as Ibus. In this context, of course, Arabic numerals are 1,2,3...\nIs it possible to use Hindi numbers in the slide footer page number function without changing every number to Hindi?\nShort answer: not through the GUI settings. Apart from the global number style setting, there does not appear to be any way to modify the function that inserts page numbers. \nInterestingly enough, the footer lets you easily change the date to Persian. I believe the page numbers cannot be changed in a similar way because the page numbers appears to be drawn from functions to work with the printer.\nThe solution is to not use the built-in footer page numbering at all and instead insert your own text shape in the same area with the text set the way you want. For a small number of slides, this would not be too bad; but would not be feasible with more than a handful.\nThe solution to this problem is to use a LibreOffice Basic macro to insert the page numbers for you.

I haven't had much luck finding a straight up comparison myself, yet but I'll check back here and let you know if I find one ^~^ Here's a few links I have found, with some useful info:\n\n\n*\n\n*https://help.ubuntu.com/community/JapaneseInput\n\n*http://kmandla.wordpress.com/2008/02/19/unraveling-scim-and-uim/\n\n*http://blogs.gnome.org/happyaron/2011/01/15/linux-input-method-brief-summary/\nAnd finally when all else fails I check Wikipedia. It seems to help (a little xD):\n\n\n*\n\n*http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intelligent_Input_Bus\n\n*http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_input_methods_for_UNIX_platforms\n\n*http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uim\nThe following link isn't for Ubuntu specifically but it does explain a lot about IME's on Linux =):\n\n\n*\n\n*http://crunchbang.org/forums/viewtopic.php?id=18883\nP.S. Oh and this is another alternative (it's called Mozc) =) It's based on Google Japanese IME. I'm not sure if it supports Korean but I know Google at least has a Korean IME so it might? I hope so! =)\n\n\n*\n\n*http://code.google.com/p/mozc/\nI know this isn't exactly what you (and I) are looking for but I hope it helps! Ganbatte! ^~^\n\nA: My experience will answer your question partially. I could get my wishes only working with SCIM, even though it’s largely unmaintained. iBus couldn’t do it. I need IME for Chinese:\n\n\n*\n\n*Wubi86 input (structure-based character input)\n\n*smart pinyin input (sound-based character input)\n\n*number-pinyin-to-accent-pinyin (letter-based letter input: I write pin1yin1 and I get pīnyīn)\n\n*switch between those via hotkey (iBus can’t do this; I use F5, F6, F7, F8)\n\n*don’t screw my dead keys (e.g. my Xserver is configured to do give me ü and é typing ¨u and ´e respectively – some input methods mess with this)\n\n", "Q: Installing Ubuntu on a Powerbook G4 667- unable to boot When going to the boot menu (after pressing option), the Powerbook G4 667MHz detects the installer (either on a CD or flash drive - depending on what I am using), but when I choose the Linux installer the screen flashes and the menu comes back in low resolution. Only the mouse works.\nI suspect the firmware is looking for a very specific configuration in the disc and it is not finding it. The same problem happens if I try to boot up the Leopard (OSX 10.5) installer or DiskWarrior 4. However Diskwarrior 3.3 and the Tiger (OSX 10.4) installer boot up without a problem.\nIt is not the Ubuntu installer because it works fine on an iMac. Maybe there is a way to work on yaboot or GRUB to talk to the Tibook? Any ideas?\n\nThe processor is: PowerPC 7440 G4\nIn the system profiler, I get:\nProcessor name: PowerPC G4 (2.1)\nBoot ROM version: 4.2.9f1\n\n\nThe installer is for PowerPC, and it works fine in my iMac (another PowerPC G4). It seems to be something more specific. I have tried different distros (Yellow Dog, Lubuntu, Debian) and they all have the same problem with this computer, but not with the iMac.\n\nLike I thought, it has to do with yaboot. I restored the image of the installer in another partition of the hard drive and forced the boot from the firmware. yaboot starts and flashes these lines:\nloading XCOFF\n\ntsize=28000 dsize=2000 bsize=3a000 entry=5616ecc\nSECTIONS\n.text     05600000   05600000   00028000 000000d4\n.data     05628000   05628000   00002000 000280d4\n.bss      0562a000   0562a000   0003a000 00000000\nloading .tex,  done\nloading  .data, done\nclearing .bss, done\n\nAfter which, it shows the \"forbidden/not allowed/cross out circle sign\" that indicates that the operating system is in a broken folder or corrupted (I haven't seen that symbol in a while).\n\nA: I think PowerPCs have a port of Ubuntu. This is a quote:\n\nDesktop CD\nThe desktop CD allows you to try Ubuntu without changing your computer at all, and at your option to install it permanently later. You will need at least 384MiB of RAM to install from this CD.\nThere is one image available:\nMac (PowerPC) and IBM-PPC (POWER5) desktop CD\nFor Apple Macintosh G3, G4, and G5 computers, including iBooks and PowerBooks as well as IBM OpenPower machines.\n\nCan't get Ubuntu 12.04 LTS Live to load properly on Apple iMac PowerPC may prove to be relevant. I'm pretty sure that the port of Ubuntu you're trying to use won't work. As far as I know, there isn't a desktop edition of 12.10 available yet that works on PowerPCs. There is a server edition, and, if you follow the above links, desktop editions of 12.04.\n\nA: The problem is due to the way Open Firmware (in the version installed in these powerbooks) maps the devices.\nIn order to boot from the CD, you should try going into Open Firmware (reboot computer and press Option-Command-o-f ).\nat the prompt, try typing:\nboot ide1:2,\\install\\yaboot\n\nThe CD is mapped as ide1 and for some reason it needs to look for the 3rd partition of the CD (didn't you know there was more than one partition in the CD?? Neither did I!!!). that is why you should try to boot from ide1:2\nIf your powerbook is like mine, you should reach the yaboot prompt (from the CD) with that command, but the installer may not run due to the fact that the screen size is not standard (these laptops use the Ati Radeon video chip but the screen is 1152 x 768) and the framebuffer is not configured by default. I found many suggestions online but failed with all of them.\nBut there is a workaround: connect an external monitor and try to work from within the system.\nI managed to install Lubuntu 10.04 with an external monitor and simply adding: nosplash video=ofonly to the main command (either Linux or Install).\nan even better solution: install Debian instead. at least Debian 6 can be installed from yaboot with:\ninstall32 nosplash video=ofonly\n\nDebian doesn't need the external monitor since it configures the screen right away.\n", "Q: How do you get the website title to show up in the menu area / webpage title are in python / quickly created web browser? hi there im creating a web browser using a mix of quickly and Python, im wanting to get a websites title to show up in the very top of the page.  im not sure of what code that i need adding to the file, ive looked all over the internet and that has been of no use.\nthis is the code i have got for the browser so far :\nimport gettext\nfrom gettext import gettext as _\ngettext.textdomain('dmbrowser')\n\nfrom gi.repository import Gtk, WebKit # pylint: disable=E0611\nimport logging\nlogger = logging.getLogger('dmbrowser')\n\nfrom dmbrowser_lib import Window\nfrom dmbrowser.AboutDmbrowserDialog import AboutDmbrowserDialog\nfrom dmbrowser.PreferencesDmbrowserDialog import PreferencesDmbrowserDialog\n\n# See dmbrowser_lib.Window.py for more details about how this class works\nclass DmbrowserWindow(Window):\n    __gtype_name__ = \"DmbrowserWindow\"\n\n    def finish_initializing(self, builder): # pylint: disable=E1002\n        \"\"\"Set up the main window\"\"\"\n        super(DmbrowserWindow, self).finish_initializing(builder)\n\n        self.AboutDialog = AboutDmbrowserDialog\n        self.PreferencesDialog = PreferencesDmbrowserDialog\n\n        # Code for other initialization actions should be added here.\n        self.backbutton = self.builder.get_object(\"backbutton\")\n        self.forwardbutton = self.builder.get_object(\"forwardbutton\")\n        self.refreshbutton = self.builder.get_object(\"refreshbutton\")\n        self.stopbutton = self.builder.get_object(\"stopbutton\")\n        self.urlentry = self.builder.get_object(\"urlentry\")\n        self.scrolledwindow = self.builder.get_object(\"scrolledwindow\")\n        self.toolbar = self.builder.get_object(\"toolbar\")\n\n        context = self.toolbar.get_style_context()\n        context.add_class(Gtk.STYLE_CLASS_PRIMARY_TOOLBAR)\n\n        self.webview = WebKit.WebView()\n\n        self.scrolledwindow.add(self.webview)\n        self.webview.show()\n\n    def on_backbutton_clicked(self, widget):\n        self.webview.go_back()\n\n    def on_forwardbutton_clicked(self,widget):\n        self.webview.go_forward()\n\n\n    def on_refreshbutton_clicked(self, widget):\n        self.webview.reload()\n\n    def on_stopbutton_clicked(self, widget):\n        self.webview.stop_loading()\n\n    def on_urlentry_activate(self, widget):\n        url = widget.get_text()\n\n        self.webview.open(\"http://\" + url)\n\n        print url\n\n\nA: Untested, but the following should work.\nself.webview.connect('notify::title', self._title_changed_cb)\n\ndef _title_changed_cb(self, webview, title):\n    self.set_title(webview.get_title())\n\nYou'll probably want a better title, like \"%s - %s\" % (title, APPNAME).\nEdit: Apprently you can't use the title property directly because it's a GParamString type.
