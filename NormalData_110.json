["Q: Is there an easy way to reorganize tags in shotwell? I have a little over 800 photos with tags in shotwell. Recently, hierarchical tags have been added.\nNow I want to reorganize my tags, e.g. I want a \"People\" tag and subtags of \"Mom\", \"Dad\", etc. Is there an easy way to do that, which doesn't involve me draging and dropping all the tags to their parent tags?\nI have quite a lot tags and since every time I drag and drop a tag, I can only select one tag I want to move and I have to wait for shotwell finishing that operation. After it's done that, the list view scrolls back to the top, which means I have to scroll back down all the way to \"People\".\nExample for clarification, pretend tags were directories. I want to do\nmv tags/{mom,dad,brother} tags/people/\n\n\nA: There is currently no way to select multiple tags in Shotwell.  There is an open ticket on this feature, feel free to add a comment on it.\nUpdate: the original link is no longer available, so an archived link to the bug report was linked.\n\nA: Not yet. Shotwell can organize your photos into folders by time only. To achieve what you want you need to use the Hierarchical Tags feature in Shotwell. This isn't exactly what you want though, so the short answer is no.\nHave a look in Preferences/Library/Importing/Pattern: and click (Help) for a list of exactly the time-based metadata Shotwell can organize by.\nIf you are just wanting to separate out groups of photos to export, you can select a group of tagged photos and export them to a new folder. From there, you could manually reorganize your Pictures directory structure in the file browser.\n~ref\n", "Q: Running programs in the background from terminal How do I run a program in the background of a shell, with the ability to close the shell while leaving the program running?\nLets say my UI is having problems or for some reason, I need to boot up a program from the terminal window, say, nm-applet:\nnm-applet\n\nWhen it's started, it occupies the foreground of the terminal window.\nIs there any simple way to run the program in the background without needing to leave the terminal open or have it occupy the whole terminal?\nOn that note, I did find a way to run programs from the terminal and have it allow for other inputs, by appending an ampersand (&) to the command as such:\nnm-applet &\n\nBut this isn't much use as any processes started in the terminal are killed once the terminal is closed.\n                                                                       \n\nA: Here's the two ways I'd go with. Firstly, not running it from a terminal; hit Alt+F2 to open the run dialog, and run it from there (without &).\nFrom a terminal, run\nnm-applet &\n\nBut do NOT close the terminal yourself. That is, do not hit the X-button to close, and do not use File -> Exit from its menubar. If you close the terminal that way, it will send a HUP (Hang UP) signal to the bash running within, which in turn will send the HUP signal to all its children (which is why nohup works in this case).\nInstead, exit the shell by running exit or hitting Ctrl+D. bash will then disown its children, then exit, leaving the background processes still running. And when bash exits, the terminal has lost its child process, so it will close too.\nDoing it all at once:\nnm-applet & exit\n\n\nA: I've recently come to like setsid. It starts off looking like you're just running something from the terminal but you can disconnect (close the terminal) and it just keeps going.\nThis is because the command actually forks out and while the input comes through to the current terminal, it's owned by a completely different parent (that remains alive after you close the terminal).\nAn example:\nsetsid gnome-calculator\n\nI'm also quite partial to disown which can be used to separate a process from the current tree. You use it in conjunction with the backgrounding ampersand:\ngnome-calculator & disown\n\nI also just learnt about spawning subshells with parenthesis. This simple method works:\n(gnome-calculator &)\n\nAnd of course there's nohup as you mentioned. I'm not wild about nohup because it has a tendency to write to ~/nohup.out without me asking it to. If you rely on that, it might be for you.\nnohup gnome-calculator\n\nAnd for the longer-term processes, there are things like screen and other virtual terminal-muxers that keep sessions alive between connections. These probably don't really apply to you because you just want temporary access to the terminal output, but if you wanted to go back some time later and view the latest terminal activity, screen would probably be your best choice.\nThe internet is full of screen tutorials but here's a simple quick-start:\n\n\n*\n\n*http://thingsilearned.com/2009/05/26/gnu-screen-super-basic-tutorial/\n\nA: I can recommend the byobu terminal. You can easily detach your process by pressing the F6 key.\n\nA: Although there are good answers above, I would like to give my 2 cents on how I use MATLAB in background.\nsudo -b matlab\n\nThe -b tag of sudo can run applications in background. You can also close the terminal after executing this command.\nProbably, unrelated but there is wonderful website that you can use to explain shell commands.\nhttp://explainshell.com/explain/8/sudo\n\nA: As you pointed out, you can run  \nnohup nm-applet &  \n\nto ignore the end signal when closing the terminal. No problem with that.\n\nA: One thing that many other answers are missing is how to detach a running process that currently blocks the shell. In most terminals and shells, Ctrl+Z will halt the running process and bring you back to an input prompt. Then, you can issue\nbg\n\nto send the running process into the background. Issue\nfg\n\ninstead to put the running process back into the foreground.\nEDIT: More detail in this answer I discovered later.\n\nA: Use （exec PROGRAM &> /dev/null & ） to  allow PID of subshell to be taken over by PROGRAM.  I've tested this approach multiple times with several different programs. Closing the original terminal has no affect on the newly-spawned program\nSmall demo:\n$ # this is before running\n$ (exec firefox &> /dev/null &)\n$ # and look, we still in side the terminal and can continue working\n\n\nA: The modern and easy to use approach that allows managing multiple processes and has a nice terminal UI is hapless utility.\nInstall with pip install hapless (or python3 -m pip install hapless) and just run\n$ hap run my-command  # e.g. hap run python my_long_running_script.py\n$ hap status  # check all the launched processes\n\nSee docs for more info.\n\nNOTE: I'm the author of this package.\n\nA: I dont know its the right way but i just start another session while leaving the previous one allone. For example i ran a simple web server on my raspberry. the web.py one. then i start a new session while leaving it alone. thats it. it also is wuite useful since you are still updated even though you are workin on the other session.\n\nA: In case KDE is used, you can also use kstart, which will start your program detached from the terminal. It also makes sure that the KDE environment is correctly setup for the command.\n(See kstart.cpp source code for reference. As you see from there, it uses KProcess::startDetached, and KProcess is derived from QProcess, and startDetached starts a new process, and detaches from it.)\nSimilar is also kde-open or xdg-open or gnome-open.\n", "Q: Permissions changed on upgrade to 11.10, now \"read-only\" I recently upgraded from 11.04 to 11.10. I have several external hard drives, and now I cannot change anything on them: the permissions have seemingly been altered to read-only.\nWhen I look at the \"Properties\" of each drive in Nautilus, it shows me as the owner, yet I can only \"Access files\".

Still no success.\nI am not a noob, but I am at a loss as to what to do next. Can anyone help? My back-up destination is one of the external drives, and I cannot back-up until this is fixed.\nThanks in advance.\n\nA: If the external drives are formatted in NTFS, most of the time they are, you will need to install ntfs-3g and ntfsprogs to access with write permissions.\nsudo apt-get install ntfs-config\n\nTo verify use gparted or sudo fdisk-l and determine the formatting.\nThis is a good reference for you to look at:\nhttps://help.ubuntu.com/community/MountingWindowsPartitions?action=show&redirect=NTFSReadWrite\n\nA: It seems to be the case that your drive is mounted as read-only.

This means that whenever you run a command and try to pass a file or a directory as an argument that contains a space in it, bash assumes it is two separate arguments. There are many ways to specify this. You can use what is called an escape character to signal that the space is part of the argument. To do this, just insert a \\ before the space in the file name\ncd Program\\ Files\nor you can use quotes to signal that it is a single parameter\ncd \"Program Files\"\nHowever, often you will not need to type the whole thing if you use the Tab Completion feature\ncd P<TAB>\nIf there are multiple files starting with P, add another alphabet and press tab again to complete. \n\nA: You need to quote any directory/file name which has spaces in, or it gets confused. Try this:\ncd \"Program Files\"\n\nAlso, you can tab-complete, so you can also try:\ncd \"Progr<press TAB>\n\nand it ought to fill the rest in for you.\n\nA: As an add-on, if you want to access 'Program Files (x86)', use apostrophes for the special characters like this:\ncd Program\\ Files\\ '('x86')'\n\n\nA: First I want to say that I love the Command Line Interface (CLI) and there are a ton of free resources on it.  As you dive into the directory and according to what you are getting stuck on...you will want to type 'cd “Program Files” and then tap enter.  You want to make sure that spelling is correct as the CLI sees files exactly how you type them.  File1 is different from file1.\nSomeone mentioned the (TAB) key and this is awesome especially when you have a ton of info to type for a file name, etc..  Next time you're in the terminal and you've dug past the hidden wine folder try typing cd dos(then TAB).  Chances are it will automatically fill in your dosdevices portion saving you valuable time.\nA valuable CLI book for me is The Linux Command Line by William E.

Some are fairly obvious.   Specifically, I am referring to:\n  -h                          halt or power off after shutdown\n  -H                          halt after shutdown (implies -h)\n  -P                          power off after shutdown (implies -h)\n\nIsn't halting or powering off kind of expected when you're shutting down?  Aren't these redundant?\n  -c                          cancel a running shutdown\n\nHow on earth would you use this?  In my experience, once a shutdown has begun, you don't get much opportunity to enter more commands until the machine is off.\n  -k                          only send warnings, don't shutdown\n\nWhy does shutdown have an option that makes it not shut down?\nWhat's the deal here?  Does \"shutdown\" mean more than simply turning the machine off?\n\nA: You have asked a bunch of questions, let me address them one by one.\nHalting is when you bring the machine to a minimal power state without fully powering off the machine. Powering off the machine is what happens when you choose Shut Down from the menu and well, the machine is completely turned off. \nCancelling a running shutdown is for when a shutdown command is issued for the machine to be shutdown after a certain period of time. For example, sudo shutdown -P +6 issues the command to shutdown after 6 minutes. The -c parameter can be used to cancel the shutdown command issued earlier. To shutdown a computer instantly you issue sudo shutdown -P now\nOnly send warnings and don't shutdown: You must remember that Linux is a multi-user operating system where many users may be logged in to the system at a given point of time. When this command is issued, it sends a message to all the users logged in that there will be a shutdown and an additional message if the system administrator adds that as well. This gives those users time to wrap up their work so that they can be prepared for the shutdown. Think of it as a warning shot to warn the users logged in to wrap up their work although the system won't undergo a shutdown procedure.\n", "Q: How do I change the the boot default from Ubuntu to Windows? \nPossible Duplicate:\nHow do I set Windows to boot as the default in the boot loader? \n\n9 days ago I added Kubuntu 11.10 (Oneiric Ocelot) to Windows 7 on my computer.

Like this...\n<command> telnet \"whoever\" > file.sh  \n\nI dont know if that's how i use to run it but i think it was close.\nThe command logged the telnet session and based on my input of username and password it generated a script automatically based on that criteria I typed.

Im pretty sure its a standard linux command but last time i used it was probably ten or twelve years ago before Ubuntu, when Red Hat was still just Red Hat \n\nA: PROBLEM SOLVED!!! Ok i found it. I had to download it but the command is autoexpect. It automatically generates an EXPECT script by watching the entire process.

Ubuntu, out of the box, has the live user signed into all tty's.\nWhat is the purpose of this?\nWhy can't I sign the user out of these tty's?\nIn a freshly installed Ubuntu environment, my user is not signed into all the tty's.  Why?\nIf I do sign into a tty in the installed environment, I can sign out.  How is this possible compared to the live situation?\nIs it possible to disable tty's?  If so, how?\n\nA: You can disabled TTY's by removing (or moving to something other than .conf) the following files:\n/etc/init/tty1.conf\n/etc/init/tty2.conf\n/etc/init/tty3.conf\n/etc/init/tty4.conf\n/etc/init/tty5.conf\n/etc/init/tty6.conf\n\nI found the culprit to the auto-login: In the /etc/init/tty1.conf in the live session, there is this line:\nexec /bin/login -f ubuntu < /dev/tty1 > /dev/tty1 2>&1\nThis makes /bin/login log in as \"ubuntu\" - which has no password set. So, if you want similar functionality, blank the password for an account and set it to log in as that account. Of course, this is generally not recommended unless you're in a live system as it leaves a gaping security hole (unless that user is severely limited).\nAlso, every time that process it killed (i.e. via exit) it gets called again - which again logs in as the \"ubuntu\" account.\n", "Q: Is there any cam splitter for ubuntu?

Additionally, you may experience some lag when using the cam for more than 1 service at once.\nIt is hungry in resources as you can see in my system monitor panel's applet, I am using the majority of my 4GB RAM (the green square) when doing this, which lessen when I close both the application and the browser and a huge amount of my Core2quad microprocessor, which also lessen after closing everything.\nI don't usually use this service for more than a service but your question encouraged me to run a test, which -in my case- was successfully.\nEven if this doesn't solve your question, I hope this give you a clue and you find a solution soon.\nGood luck!\n", "Q: How to disable automatic login in LightDM? I was playing around with \"User accounts\" and somehow set automatic login. Now, when I start my PC, it just has one button named as \"login\". Clicking that button, directly logs me in to my PC.\nThere is no music or no asking for password while logging in. As a side effect, it asks me separately for keyring password \nHow to disable auto login and make login/keyring password unified again like before?\nNOTE: Attempting to disable Automatic Login from System Settings > User Accounts does not work.\nThis is the content of my /etc/lightdm/lightdm.conf (where I have commented the autologin for my username mgandhi):\n[SeatDefaults]\ngreeter-session=unity-greeter\nuser-session=ubuntu\n#autologin-user=mgandhi\n\n\nA: System Setings\n\n\nDisable Automatic Login\n\nA: gksu gedit /etc/lightdm/lightdm.conf\n\nYou should see something similar to this:\n[SeatDefaults]\nautologin-guest=false \nautologin-user=username\nautologin-user-timeout=0\nautologin-session=lightdm-autologin\ngreeter-session=unity-greeter\nuser-session=ubuntu\n\nRemove or put a # at the start of each line containing autologin and save/exit and reboot to test.\n\nA: gksudo gedit /etc/lightdm/lightdm.conf \n\nIt displays some text as follows:\n[SeatDefaults]  \ngreeter-session=unity-greeter  \nuser-session=ubuntu  \nautologin-user=username\n\nSolution \n\n\n*\n\n*This <username> would be your particular user name that is automatically logged in with or without password. Delete this username and type in the administrative username or leave it blank.\n\n*Shut down the system. It will go back to the login selection screen. Just power down the system and put it on again.\n\n\nA: Go to your terminal and enter this:\npasswd\n\nIt will ask you with your new Unix password and solved.\nThen, later, you can go to your user account and change anything.\n\nA: It's rare that @duffydack answer does not fit you... try this:\non a terminal do:\nsudo vi /etc/gdm/custom.conf\n\nor\nsudo nano /etc/gdm/custom.conf\n\nYour file should now look something like this:\n[daemon]\nAutomaticLoginEnable=false\nAutomaticLogin=craig\nTimedLoginEnable=false\nTimedLogin=craig\nTimedLoginDelay=10\nDefaultSession=gnome-2d\n\nedit  AutomaticLoginEnable=true to AutomaticLoginEnable=false\nthat's other option.\n\nA: Ok, finally the problem is solved. I got an email from an occasional stack-exchange visitor Mr. Rafter. Following is the way:\n\n\n*\n\n*Run sudo grep nopasswd /etc/*\n\n*This will display at least 2 lines:\n/etc/group:nopasswdlogin:x:112:`<login name>`   \n/etc/gshadow:nopasswdlogin:!::`<login name>`\n\n\n*Edit those files with sudo and remove only <login name> from those lines and save.\n\n*Go to \"User Accounts\" and disable the automatic login\n\n*Restart the computer and now it should ask for the password again!\n\n\nA: Figured out an answer:\n\n\n*\n\n*Boot with Ubuntu live CD.\n\n*Edit lightdm.conf as root.\n\n*Comment out (with #) autologon of user.\n\n*Save and reboot into system.\n\n*Boot to user login screen, select Ubuntu and enter password.\n\n*Boot into usual Ubuntu desktop.\n\n\nA: I am running 12.10 and I tried everything in this thread and nothing worked. Eventually I tried deleting suspicious lines in lightdm.conf and was successful:\n\n\n*\n\n*Run gksu gedit /etc/lightdm/lightdm.conf\n\n*I can't remember the exact line because I have since deleted it, but it's something like autologin-lightdm=true. Delete it.\nHope this works!\n\nA: I had the same problem and it was solved by the command: \nsudo gpasswd -d USER nopasswdlogin\n\nwhere you should change USER by your user name.\n\nA: System Settings > User Accounts. Select your user and disable automatic login.\n\nA: Open the file /etc/group (vi /etc/group) and find the group 'nopasswdlogin'. you will see your user name in that group. comment out that line (inserting # before) or just delete the line.\nThis should do it.\n\nA: Since you\nwas playing around with \"User accounts\" and I made same mistake, I got in same hole.\nKeep cool.\nYou just set your system to no-password when \"playing around\". \nThat's why your system log in (auto or not) without asking for password, and this is the same reason keyring system asks for it (cause doesn't received from the system).\nSo, action jackson:\n\n\n*\n\n*Check what I am talking about. Go to Menu in Top Bar and choose 1st item (Switch User Account...) and see Login button (what mean you already logged and no user to choose, u can just login, u have no pass (OH!) \n\n*After clicking Login, and back to desktop, Choose again in top menu bar the logout command, and logout. You gonna see a button with your username, no \"login\" button.\n\n*Correcting things: Setting a new password. Set the same old one, to keyring dont get confused again, or it will ask you for the password again, after login with password provided. Go to same menu of item 1 and choose last item now (User Accounts...) and on this Gui interface , unlock on the respective button probably providing no password at all (just Enter, if this not works try with old pass..), and then THE GREAT MAGIC TRICK\nCLICK THE PASSWORD BOX (its a hidden button, oh devil UI)\nthis open a dialog box (!) where u probably hit the \"login without password\" option AND with automatic login option ON too (outside this dialog, on User Accounts screen). SO:...\nWhen you tell the computer to log in without a password (ITS NOT the same as Automatic Login) he does exactly this , log in, without password. So password = nothing. Then keyring goes crazy. (aha!) So, choose the right option now:\nSet a password now\nand after doing all the entry password stuff, simple hit enter, set automatic login off, to feel again the  pleasure of having a password, and if you want it on again, ok, turn it on, but dont log in without a password again. =D\nI hope this helps you to solve your problem. Was a good lesson to me.

I'm interested in how to form the shh command in the following scenarios.  To keep it simple, I will not be using password protected accounts.  I would like to focus primarily on command formations that establish the connection.\n\n\n*\n\n*Two local Ubuntu computers directly connected with an Ethernet cable:\n\n*Two remote Ubuntu computers where each is connected via cable modem (each has it's own ip):\n\n*Same as previous, but one is using NAT:\n\n*Two remote Ubuntu computers, where one is connected via a cable modem and the other is connected via a wireless router:\n\n*Two local boxes connected to the same wireless router:\n\nA: With local Ubuntu boxes, whether they're connected directly or using a switch, you can use hostname.local to connect. So, if your laptop is called bambuntulaptop, then you can connect to it using bambuntulaptop.local. \nFor non-local connections, you'll have to use an IP address or setup a dns server. You can use ddclient coupled with a service like dyndns.org. \nNAT isn't really relevant with regards to ssh. You'll need to forward port 22 to the right machine, or configure your ssh server to use another port and forward that one. Port 22 is the default ssh port. \nYou must not allow non-protected accounts. There are thousands, or hundreds of thousands of computers who are scanning for things to abuse. Allowing any user on the internet to run programs on your computer is a seriously bad idea. Ubuntu is secure, but not that secure. In fact, I don't think you will be allowed to use non-password protected accounts with ssh. If you wanted to do that, then you'd need to setup keys. That would be another question. \nThe command to establish the connection itself, could hardly be any easier: ssh username@host. In other words, reusing the example from above; ssh bambuntu@bambuntulaptop.local. \n\nA: ssh works the same way across all these scenarios. The network configuration is not important. ( OK You may have to set up port mapping to go across a NAT ). \nAt it's simplest you run\nssh {host}\nNot using passwords doesn't make it simpler, because you will have to set up keys, which is slightly more complicated.\nSetting up ssh is simple to do, just install openssh-server and openssh-client and then connect using ssh {host}\n", "Q: How to install package that was downloaded as source files \nPossible Duplicate:\nHow to compile source code from a tarball? \n\nPlease suggest me as step-by-step process.\nI thinkthat first of all,I have to decompress and compile them but I don't know how to do.\n\nA: Here is what you need to do...\nDecompress the tra/gzip file\nGo into the decompressed directory\nLook for files like: README or INSTALL.

I am trying to get started with this, for me, new thing. I am only used to windows.\nI have tried to get some kind of visual access to my new server but failed.\nGoogling led me to run this command 'apt-get install vino'. A lot happened and I guess it was installed.\nThen I typed vino-preferences and it said 'Gtk-WARNING **: cannot open display:'\nThen I tried 'vino-server' and it said 'vino-server: command not found'\nI can see in /usr/lib/vino that therer is a green entry called vino-server.\nPlease help me.\n\nA: Usually linux servers are configured without GUI. Looks like you already have command line access to your server.\nYou can try this command to verify if a GUI it's installed.\ndpkg-query -W xorg\n\nIf a GUI is installed it will show something like this:\nxorg    1:7.6+10ubuntu1\n\nIf there is no GUI it will output an empty line.\nNow, if there is no GUI there the wise solution is to leave it that way and learn to use the command line. If you really need a GUI, you should first check if your provider allows it and that you have enough resources for it. You can install it with:\nsudo apt-get install ubuntu-desktop\n\nNow you can proceed to use any remote access solution. I personally like FreeNX. These questions will help you:\n\n\n*\n\n*How do I install FreeNX server so that it works correctly?\n\n*What is the best way to set up a headless server?\nFinally, let me advice you again to learn the command line. It's how a linux server is expected to be administered.\n\nA: Assuming your server has a GUI installed:\nRun x11vnc on the server instead:\nsudo apt-get install x11vnc on the machine\nThen, run it: x11vnc -once -passwd [some password]\nOn your side install vncviewer in Ubuntu or TightVNC in Windows\nThen use the VNC viewer to connect to your server.\nJust a thought: if this is a cloud server with LAMP, chances are it doesn't have a GUI installed, so this won't work for you.\n\nA: The vino-preferences application gave that error because the application is graphical and you can't display graphical linux applications from the command line without doing some extra work.\nIt's hard to know if your cloud server has provided some kind of web based interface to run commands, or if you have connected using an SSH client (such as Putty on Windows). If you want to enable vino using vino-preferences then you will need to run it in a graphical environment. If the cloud provider doesn't provide one you will need to connect using an SSH client and X server for Windows.\nThis is less painful than it sounds. I'll assume you have a working SSH client, if not google [putty download] and install it. Then look in your cloud providers documentation for how to connect to their service.\nAfter that you will need to install an X server. I've used Xming in the past and it's quite easy. Get it here: http://www.straightrunning.com/XmingNotes/. Install Xming and start the X server. Then follow these instructions to configure Putty:\nhttp://tldp.org/HOWTO/XDMCP-HOWTO/ssh.html\nOnce you have a working SSH connection you should be able to run the vion-preferences application and have the interface display locally on your desktop.\nGood luck with your first steps in Linux!\n\nA: Remote desktop is, IMO, not the best option for managing a server. Managing a server generally involves installing packages, updating packages, starting/stopping services, managing a firewall, and editing configuration files. All of this can be done securely and easily over ssh.\nssh -X user@server\n\nIf you must have a graphical interface, take a look at web interfaces such as webmin or phpmyadmin.\nAlso take care with VNC (remote desktop). It is an insecure protocol and one of the most common \"cracks\" I see. Again if you must use VNC, use FreeNX, which is both fast and secure.\n\nA: You can also connect using ssh X forwarding...\nI recommend you forget about Remote Desktop & install a server admin panel instead.\nShop around for web admin panels, you should be able to find one that suits your requirements - I recommend: Webmin\n", "Q: Can I connect totem/mplayer with my multimedia library as the default player?

So, your netstat -tup command can be enhanced to:\nsudo netstat -tup | grep 48293.kwaimuk.canonical\n\n(You need to be root for -p to work). The final field on the line should be a PID. If the process name just says python, get the full script name via:\nps auxw | grep PID\n\nNow hopefully you have the location of a script/program that's using this connection. Probably something.py.\nFind which package it's in via dpkg:\ndpkg -S /usr/local/bin/something.py\n\nAnd now you can apt-get remove the offending package. Caution here as ever, be careful what dependencies it also tries to remove.\n\nA: The problem is that python could be any number of applications, or even a background script. For example, if you use Screenlets, I believe the widgets are python processes. You can't remove python as it would disable a lot of important apps and scripts. If you want to stop leaking bandwidth, you can try what I've outlined in this Google+ post: https://plus.google.com/118226948467140990198/posts/YZhZJCZmGgm\nThe TL;DR version: block all TCP/IP traffic except those run by a new group you create. Then open a shell with access to that group and only apps you launch from that shell will have internet access. First create the group:\nsudo groupadd internet\n\nNow save this into a script and run it when you want to control bandwidth:\n#!/bin/sh\n# Firewall apps - only allow apps run from \"internet\" group to run\n\n# clear previous rules\nsudo iptables -F\n\n# accept packets for internet group\nsudo iptables -A OUTPUT -p tcp -m owner --gid-owner internet -j ACCEPT\n\n# also allow local connections\nsudo iptables -A OUTPUT -p tcp -d 127.0.0.1 -j ACCEPT\nsudo iptables -A OUTPUT -p tcp -d 192.168.0.1/24 -j ACCEPT\n\n# reject packets for other traffic\nsudo iptables -A OUTPUT -p tcp -j REJECT\n\n# open a shell with internet access\nsudo -g internet -s\n\nYou might have to change the \"192.68.0.1/24\" bit to suit your local network. Now you will get a shell from which any apps you start (like firefox) will have internet access. The apps will still run under your username. All other apps will be blocked (unless they already have a persistent connection, in which case you will need to kill those processes).\n", "Q: IPython3 command not found After configuring and installing IPython to run under python3, as explained by this wiki, and having completed all the steps, I still get:\ngmask@Gbuntu:~$ ipython3 qtconsole\nNo command 'ipython3' found, did you mean:\nCommand 'ipythonx' from package 'ipython' (universe)\nCommand 'ipython' from package 'ipython' (universe)\nCommand 'python3' from package 'python3-minimal' (main)\nipython3: command not found\n\nNo idea what I am doing wrong... \n\nA: You shouldn't use \"make install\". Use checkinstall instead. That creates a deb package first so that you can easily uninstall afterwards. \nMy guess is that you installed it in a directory that's not in your path. You'll need to check the documentation for that and add it to your path manually. By the way; ipython3 is in Precise, so when you upgrade, you'll be able to simply apt-get it. \n\nA: install ipython globally\nsudo pip3 install ipython\n\n", "Q: Where is the per-user salt kept?

From the notes section:\n\n[..] So $5$salt$encrypted is an SHA-256 encoded password and $6$salt$encrypted is an SHA-512 encoded one.\n\"salt\"  stands  for  the  up  to 16 characters following \"$id$\" in the salt.

Nice, fairly simple and very capable.\nsudo apt-get install postfix\n\n\n*If you need sendmail (ie something has a hard dependency on it that you can't replace), then you want to look at fixing this specific error. Something like this might work:\nmakemap hash /etc/mail/aliases.db < /etc/mail/aliases\n\n\nA: Bah!  Although I had removed sendmail I had not restarted my computer.

What's the correct way of doing these two things (move and resize)?\n\nA: *\n\n*Time consuming and perfect copy, with the bits in the same order on the disk is made with the unix command dd. Boot off your CD and open Disk Utility (palimpsest). Identify the device IDs of the two hard drives, for instance /dev/sda (the old hard drive) and /dev/sdb (the new one). Next, copy directly with the command dd if=/dev/sda of=/dev/sdb in this case. That step will take days even if the disk is not full. Lastly, open up Disk Utility (palimpsest) again and expand the partition to cover the whole 300GB drive and update grub.\n\n*Another way would be to do a complete install on the other drive and then copy over your home folder.\n\n*Also, you could simply take a directory and move its contents to the other drive and place a symbolic link from one drive to the other to save space - I do this for my ~/.wine folder on my Ubuntu-running desktop.\n\n\nJust putting in the new drive and copying over all the files by themselves will not work because the disk will not be listed in GRUB and the partition is not set as bootable.\n\nA: Clonezilla may be useful for cloning your hard disk, even for those situations on which you need to do it with different size disks as mentioned here: http://www.tuxradar.com/content/how-clone-hard-drives-clonezilla\n\n\nMoving to a bigger disk\nIt's easy to ensure that a clone of a SCSI\n  disk is restored to a SCSI disk, but you'll have a tough time finding\n  an exact replica size-wise.

The even better news is that\n  you can in fact restore the image to a much larger disk.\nWhen restoring a disk, Clonezilla enables you to resize the filesystem\n  and create partitions on the new disk proportionally.

In that case you can ask Clonezilla to create the\n  partition table as its listed in the image.\n\nThere is documentation about moving to a larger disk as mentioned here but I am not sure that you can do it the opposite (cloning to a smaller disk).\nHowever, it's worth to try. Clonezilla offers several Live CD's and bootable USB images and there is also documented that you can resize the free space on the disk after the copy, in which case the suggestion by @maniat1k to use gparted is also a good idea.\nIf you use clonezilla, I would appreciate if you drop comments with your experiences over here in order to have well documented how does this work for future reference.\nThank you a lot and Good luck!\n\nA: with an live cd open a terminal as root (sudo -i) and use dd.\nexample: dd if=origin of=destination.\nyou can do a copy from one hdd to another like this\ndd if=/dev/sdx of=/dev/sdy\n\nwith the same live-cd you can use gparted and resize what you want.\n", "Q: Embed terminal on desktop positioning this is my script to embed terminal in my desktop, but how do I make it appear in the corner next to the unity launcher?\n#!/bin/bash\nsleep 20 && gnome-terminal --window-with-profile=trans777 &\n\n\nA: You have to use the --geometry argument with the gnome-terminal command.\nExample: gnome-terminal --geometry 114x26+170+30\nThis will open up gnome terminal 114 columns wide by 26 rows deep and place it pretty close to the middle of the screen based on the 170+30.

I know I should be using SSH public/private key authentication, but the person who runs the server that hosts the SVN repo isn't interested in setting this up for me!\n\nWell that's very mean! I assume you have SSH access to do this though. Most modern installations of OpenSSH don't require any setup on the server to be done (past installing it). I would seriously consider just attempting to set up a SSH key first:\nssh-keygen\nssh-copy-id username@remotehost\n\nThen just try ssh username@remotehost. If it logs you in, magic, if it doesn't, you've only lost a minute of your life :)\nAfter that you've got options like expect and sshpass which are much worse because you're hard-coding your password in plaintext.

When I'm in my home directory and type locate *.cpp I get hundreds of results.\nUsing the same command in (for example) ~/../forfun/netstream/, I see only a few results.\nHow is this possible?  \n\nA: If you run locate *.cpp in the shell the shell will first try to expand *.cpp to all file names matching that pattern and then call locate with this file names as argument. \nSo if there are any .cpp files in your current directory locate will never see the *.cpp but only the file names it expands to.\nUse\nlocate '*.cpp'\n\nif you don't want the shell to try to expand the pattern.\n\nA: locate is a database-based finding method. It's damned fast but it's not thorough. I'd suggest using find which is comparatively a lot slower, but can do what you're after:\nfind /home/forfun/netstream/ -name '*.cpp'\n\nAlternatively if you're happy with the output of locate but just want to trim it down, you can always pipe it through grep:\nlocate '*.cpp' | grep 'forfun/netstream'\n\n", "Q: How to remove a locale (i.e. to drop it from `$LANGUAGE` variable)?

With Language Selector you can drag en_CA out of the list of languages (i.e. below the 'English' entry), and that should remove it from your LANGUAGE variable without having to manually edit system files.\nYou'll then need to log out and log back into your session for the changes to take effect.\n", "Q: Kile crashes upon closing project Kile allows me to work, but it keeps crashing every time I close a project.

I will try to make it as succinct as possible. Whenever I try to play some of my videos(not happening with all), regardless of the video format, there is a horizontal line of disturbance on the top of the video, usually 2-3 cm down from the top. Well, it is only noticeable when the video is in full screen mood and I have no idea how to describe the problem. I hope it is something that can be fixed easily. I googled it without luck. Is there any solution to this? BTW I am running Ubuntu 11.10 64-bit on Dell Inspiron N5050.\n\nA: If you are using the proprietary AMD video drivers (fglrx), then this is a well known problem. There is a setting in the AMD Catalyst Control Center that is supposed to fix this (I think it's called tear free playback or something like this). Another solution, which will probably work, is to uninstall fglrx and use the open source radeon driver instead (which in turn has its own problems like bad performance in games and no audio when using hdmi).\n\nA: here is the solution that I found. With Compiz settings installed, I had to tick the following in \"workarounds\" - \"Force full screen redraws on repaint\" &\"Don't wait for video sync\". It worked for me.

It has to be between 550MB and 850MB (more or less). You can burn a CD ISO to a DVD and it will work because the ISO doesn't increase in size, but if you create an Ubuntu USB with a CD ISO, Wubi copies the entire USB partition before checking the size. So if you're installing from a USB with a partition > ~850MB then it won't work. It's hard to know exactly since you haven't included more of the log.\nIn summary: what you've got there is not recognizable as an Ubuntu Desktop CD ISO (even if it is a valid one).\nSolution:\nPlace wubi.exe and the desktop CD ISO (both from the same release) in the same directory and run wubi from there. Make sure you remove any other media (CDs, USBs) first. Or run wubi.exe standalone and it will download the image itself.\n", "Q: GNOME application doesn't use the system input method I set my system input method to gcin with im-switcher.\nBut when I use some GNOME based application, such as gedit and gnome-terminal, my default input method is still Simple(i.e. I can type only English letter). \nBut in other applications, like Chrome, I can use gcin and everything works well.\nWhy does GNOME have a different input method setting?

It would have made sense if switching windows completely gave be an empty unity bar where I can start multiple, independent instances of various applications.\n\nA: It is simply for convinience while doing diffrent works at a time\n\nA: Workspaces serve this purpose for me: When I'm supposed to be working on homework but have other plans in mind, I keep my homework on the first workspace and my play on the second. Then, when parent comes by, Quick! Ctrl + Alt + Left Arrow! Wow, William, you've made great progress! Keep up the good work! Then I feel guilty and actually do my schoolwork. Thought I should share a specific situation for using workspaces.\n\nA: Workspaces have been around in Ubuntu well before the switch to Unity. They basically provide you a way to group windows related to similar tasks together, as well as get \"additional\" screenspace.\nThe Unity launcher is set to behave so that if you already have windows for an application open, it assumes that by clicking on its icon that you want to return to those open windows, where you may already have tabs or work open. If you want to launch new instances of an application using the icons, just middle-click them.\n\nA: Avoiding jumping to Applications of other workspace\nGo to New workspace. Now you have Some FireFox Browsers open in Old workspace. If you choose FireFox browser in New workspace, Ubuntu will take you to Old workspace FireFox. Actually you will be taken to Old workspace itself if you select any Application in New workspace that is already in Old workspace.  To avoid this and open any application in New workspace You have to open a Duplicate.  Middle Click the application in New  workspace and you will not be taken to old workspace..\n\nA: i want to have a good eye on every thing \n\n\n*\n\n*watching movie\n\n*askubuntu page auto reloading \n\n*Skype \n\n*w8ing for important mail \n\n\n\n\nA: You might be able to modify Unity launcher to open a new window of an application whenever an icon is clicked. Try checking out Compizconfig settings manager.\nI do agree that if you are a person who launches applications via icons in the bar, there is little meaning in having workspaces.\nYou may also try launching applications by typing their name after pressing the windows key.\n", "Q: No sound after upgrading to VLC 2.0.1 Every sound is working on my 11.10 64bit machine except of VLC.

I \n\nA: This is not possible, the top panel is a menu bar not a place to put shortcuts, you can put xkill on the launcher though.\n", "Q: Dual boot with Windows 7 issue: Windows occasionally restarts at startup The installation went smooth and everything works fine with Ubuntu. The issue is as follows:\nWhen I boot into Windows 7, it shows the Windows logo and start loading and suddenly restarts. Luckily, this does not happen always, after a few restarts it does startup properly.\nWhat seems to be the problem?\n\nA: Try to schedule a disk check when you are able to boot or press F8 for the Windows boot menu and boot in safe mode.\nYou can schedule a disk check by pressing the Win + r keys and typing chkdsk /F.\n\nA: All modern operating systems (Windows7, the 'buntus, etc) do error-check-repair when booting. What is happening in your case is normal. \nEventually, after about two Windows7 reboots, it accepts that there is another operating system on the computer. If it contines to give the message: \" ... press any key if you do not want ...\" to error check, then stop it from further error checking.  If you watch the error checks, you will see they it detects no further errors, but continues with its silly nag-screens.\nOnly rarely do I use Win7 now, but when I do, Win7 hates things that Linux tolerates, like filenames with \" ? ! ... ; in their filenames. That is mainly what Win7 is complaining.  Occasionally it does have a real gripe. So I let Win7 do its NTFS file system check.  When it finds 'errors', it creates a directory called dirxxx, with many files names filexxx.chk. Some of these filexxx.chk are zero files, so I delete these. Under 1 kilobyte - delete these.  Others are renamed to filesxxx.txt, then (sometimes) examined to put the correct extension on them.\nSometimes I seemingly lose work, since all my data, archives, temp, cache, etc are on NTFS-compressed partitions & files. But regular backups, and easily tracable work tracking, I avoid losing my work & data.\n", "Q: Changing the start menu icon in Xubuntu I'm trying to change the appearance of my desktop and I was wondering if there was a way to change the icon for the start menu,in Xubuntu, from a mouse to something else?\n\nA: Right-click it and select Properties, then click the Icon button and choose the one you want.\n\n", "Q: Is Ubuntu Sniff Proof Out of the Box? I just found out about xinput and how it proves any gui's running on the same x-session can sniff each other.\nIs there a support team for each app included in the Ubuntu repo's that checks for sniff code? I can imagine there must be specific libraries and commands in respective languages in the source that would identify sniffing attempts.\nIf we are protected from these sort of apps for the most part, the only other thing I can think of are networking apps.  For example, scripts that may launch inside of Firefox that ships with Ubuntu.  Does the end user have to install a Firefox add-on to actually get a sniffer inside of Ubuntu or could just some script from a webpage inject sniffing of the x-session?  Or both?\nShould we be concerned with torrent programs such as Transmission or Deluge?\nIs there anyway to log processes that are getting keyboard, mouse, x-screen events to know what is paying attention?\n\nA: The Ubuntu wiki page on Repositories states:\n\nRepositories make it very easy to install new software onto Ubuntu using an Internet connection, while also providing a high level of security, as each program available in the repositories is thoroughly tested and built specifically for each version of Ubuntu.\n\nYou won't have to worry about Transmission or default shipped apps.\nBy default the system ships secure. With any system running malicious code as root could compromise you. \nBe wary of what untrusted apps you install, but in general open source is safe in the face of \"many eyes\", public code reviews lend a certain level of trust to the system. But you should also be aware and know better than to run flakey software. If unsure, ask on forums or friends, (Ubuntu Forums).\nSee the \"Adding Other Repositories\" section in that wiki page for outside sources. Sometimes it's not easy knowing what is safe, so ask your peers.\nThis brings up a well known problem with proprietary drivers, without the source how do we know what it does? A great example is that of the Sony rootkit scandal: if a large, 'trusted' corporation does it, any other mega-corp (TM) can too.\nAs far as scripts / add-ons in your web browser goes: A good rule of thumb is: less is better. Opt for script blockers like NoScript. A technique called Sandboxing runs your browser processes isolated from the host OS, to separate local resource from potential threats. Chrome does this by design, for Firefox you can use some tricks to make it sandboxed AFAIK, but you will have to do research on this to understand how and why.\n", "Q: encfs home directory: ssh access dismount after a while I've setup an encrypted homedir according to this EncryptedHomeDirectoryHowto.\nTo gain ssh access I've added auth required pam_encfs.so to /etc/pam.d/sshd\n$ cat /etc/pam.d/sshd | egrep -v ^#\nauth       required     pam_env.so # [1]\nauth       required     pam_env.so envfile=/etc/default/locale\nauth       required     pam_encfs.so\n@include   common-auth\naccount    required     pam_nologin.so\n@include   common-account\n@include   common-session\nsession    optional     pam_motd.so # [1]\nsession    optional     pam_mail.so standard noenv # [1]\nsession    required     pam_limits.so\n\nIt does work for a short time after login but after 5-10min the homedir will be unmounted.

On my new computer I would like to avoid installing Wine for just this task.\n\nAre there any native tools that I can use for the same purpose?\n\nI don't mind if they are command-line only, or to use two different programs for mp3 and ogg, but I want to be absolutely certain that they only write a tag and do not mess with the original file otherwise, e.g. by actually reencoding at a different volume.\n\nA: Instead of being \"a bit scared\" or following unrelated links, why not simply read the manual?\nFrom man mp3gain:\n   mp3gain optionally writes gain adjustments directly into the encoded data.  In  this\n   case,  the  adjustment works with all mp3 players, i.e. no support for a special tag\n   is required.  This mode is activated by any of the options -r, -a, -g, or -l.\n\n   If none of the above options are given, the recommended gain change is instead writ‐\n   ten  to  a special tag in the mp3 file. In this case, the adjustment only works with\n   mp3 players that support this tag.  Some mp3 players refer to  this  as  ReplayGain.\n   The  tag is written either in APEv2 format (default) or in ID3v2 format (with -s i).\n   If you only want to print the recommended gain change (and not modify  the  file  at\n   all) you may use the -s s (skip tag) option.\n\nSo it only modifies the audio stream if you tell it to, otherwise it writes to tags only.\nSide note: many of the URLs posted in comments are not related to current mp3gain found in Ubuntu: they are either terribly outdated or they refer to the windows version.\nWhenever in doubt as how a given command works, always try man first. If that is not enough (or no man page available), use the correct upstream website, which can be checked in Ubuntu's package page.\n\nA: I got part of the way through (okay most of the way through :( ) writing a wrapper script for the answer supplied by \"N.N.\" when I discovered rgain. The answers recommending mp3gain wouldn't work for me as my library is mostly flac.  rgain (listed in package repositories as python-rgain) is a library for interacting with replay gain tags of various file types, but it also comes with some wrapper scripts for it's most apparent uses. I'm currently running it, it seems like it will take a long time, and we shall see how it performs in time...\nsudo apt-get install -y python-rgain\ncollectiongain ~/Music\n\nhttps://bitbucket.org/fk/rgain/\nEdit: I have been using it for some time now and while it's not perfect, it has been a huge improvement to listening to music. I'd say I have to adjust the volume maybe 10-15% as much as I used to. It did take three or four days on my crappy old computer to analyze my whole library. I'm about to start it on some new stuff I've downloaded.\nAlso, when I was running it the first time, it got interrupted a few times, and didn't explain why. I just ran it again, and it picked up analyzing where it left off, having successfully saved the tags it had done so far. What I mean is, it scans much faster than it analyzes so if it stops just restart it.\n\nA: UPDATE: mp3gain should not alter your audio stream unless you use one of the -r, -a, -g, or -l options. On my (vanilla) Ubuntu 12.04 installation it appeared to do so at first, but now I am unable to reproduce that. I might have been tricked by Audacity into thinking the audio stream changed when comparing my before/after files, e.g. by an Audacity plug-in applying replaygain tags as an input gain stage before opening mp3-files in its mixer.\nIf you're in doubt about whether your audio streams change, you may want to compare them by doing as follows:\n\n\n*\n\n*Make a copy of a not-yet-tagged mp3 file\n\n*Use mp3gain on one of the copies\n\n*Line up both versions of the file in a DAW (such as Audacity, Cubase, Garageband, ProTools, Audition, or equivalent). Make sure they're sample-accurately lined up, and that no other application is playing audio on your computer\n\n*Flip the phase on one of the copies (a.k.a. \"invert phase\", etc) and play back the mix\n\n*If you cannot hear sound, the audio streams are 100% identical, and thus unaffected by mp3-/vorbisgain. If you hear something, they're different.\n\n\nA: I just wanted to add a little more information. I will reinforce that mp3gain will only modify the file if you tell it to; otherwise it will merely add a tag. Also, SoundKonverter will provide a GUI interface to mp3gain and several other tools to calculate gain for other files. There is an option in SoundKonverter to modify the file, but it is off by default, only adding a tag.\nOne other point that I wanted to make clear is that even if you modify the file directly with mp3gain, it does not re-encode the file. One of the features of the mp3 format is the ability to change the gain (or \"volume\") of a file nondestructively, i.e. without re-encoding.\n\nA: There are command line tools for calculating ReplayGain values and adding ReplayGain tags. To install the tools for mp3, ogg and FLAC do the following:\nsudo apt-get install mp3gain vorbisgain flac\n\nThen to add ReplayGain tags to an album that consists of all files in a directory do the following for mp3:\nmp3gain -a *.mp3\n\nFor the same task when the album is in ogg vorbis do the following:\nvorbisgain -a *.ogg\n\nFor the same task when the album is in FLAC files do the following:\nmetaflac --add-replay-gain *.flac\n\nIf you want to add ReplayGain tags to files that are not albums instead use the -r option for mp3gain and vorbisgain (there is no corresponding option for metaflac):\nmp3gain -r *.mp3\nvorbisgain -r *.ogg\n\nAll tools can also be used to remove ReplayGain tags.\nAs always, make sure you have backups before proceed with any file modification. I have never had problems with these tools but I cannot guarantee they are failsafe (also, your computer could crash or you might have a power outage halfway through the process).\n\nA: An old question, but still a question one can have.\nNot mentioned here is \"Quod Libet\" - Music player and music library manager. It has a plugin for replaygain that just has to be enabled. Then it's possible to have tracks analyzed and tagged with replaygain information (REPLAYGAIN_TRACK_GAIN, REPLAYGAIN_TRACK_PEAK, REPLAYGAIN_ALBUM_GAIN, REPLAYGAIN_ALBUM_PEAK)\n", "Q: Add wrong device to software raid? a few days ago my raid5 had an crash. i replaced the hdd and add the wrong device to the raid (i add the device and not the partition)\nNow the raid seems to work with follow config:\nmd0 : active raid5 sde1[4] sdd1[3] sdc[5] sdb1[1] sda1[0]\n      7814051840 blocks super 1.2 level 5, 512k chunk, algorithm 2 [5/4] [UU_UU]\n      [>....................]  recovery =  1.0% (20819448/1953512960) finish=865.7min speed=37205K/sec\nMy question is what happend to sdc? why it's important first to create a FD partition and to add sdc1 instead of sdc?\nWhat could happend with my configuration?\n\nA: What happened is sdc got added to the array.

I check all settings and don't find an option to\ndisable the internal PC speaker. \nIs there any solution for this problem?\n\nA: You can temporarily disable the internal speaker with this command:\n\nsudo modprobe -r pcspkr\n\nOr to permanently disable it create a new file in /etc/modprobe.d/ called something like blacklist-pcspkr.conf or whatever you'll recognize.  Add the following line to that file:\n\nblacklist pcspkr\n\nOf course, that will completely disable the speaker while the OS is running, so things like command line typos that make it beep as feedback won't happen either (BIOS errors will still work as the OS won't have disabled it by that point).  If you want it to beep when it normally would on certain errors, but not to play music through it, then that will require some further troubleshooting into your sound settings to see why everything is playing through that output.\n", "Q: How to fix sudo: setreuid(ROOT_UID, user_uid): Operation not permitted error?

The problem is with the way libgcrypt (the current crypto backend for GnuTLS) initializes.  The problem has been around since Ubuntu 9.10 and hasn't really been addressed because upstream GnuTLS is switching from libgcrypt (which evidently has other problems as well) to libnettle. Until this change makes it downstream, there are three possible work arounds, all of which are enumerated in the bug report above.\n\n\n*\n\n*Compile libgnutls26 from source to use libnettle instead of libgcrypt\n\n*Compile libldap from source to use openssl instead of gnutls26\n\n*Use libnss-ldapd instead of libnss-ldap. This has several variations.  First use libpam-ldap which pulls in libnns-ldap as a dependency which makes configuration complicated. And second, use libpam-ldapd which is not complete.  It especially lacks all the pam_* configurations which allow limiting subsets of users. In order to overcome this deficiency you could use the nssov overlay with slapd, but this is not included in slapd with Ubuntu (So you would need to compile from source). libpam-ldapd uses the nslcd daemon to handle the ldap lookups; it therefore uses /etc/nslcd.conf\ninstead of /etc/ldap for configuration.  Of particular note, you could use the pam_authz_search to restrict authorization. See man nslcd.conf for details. There is also a pretty good howto here, and here if you need to configure startTLS.\n\n\nUPDATE: As of 5/29/2012 a bug fix was available in the proposed repository for Lucid, Natty, and Oneiric. This fixed the issues with LDAP logins; however, as of 9/6/2012 this new patch has been shown to break other packages1, and has been removed. Also, as documented in this bug, the workaround using nscd, no longer works at all. This is an unfortunate regression, and worse, the problem isn't really fixed in Precise and Quantal. Ultimately, the only real fix is to ditch libgcrypt11 in favor libnettle4. The newer libgnutls28 in Precise and Quantal already do this, but libldap still uses libgnutls26. \nThe instructions to compile libgnutls26 from source are explained in comments 22, 23, and 24 in this bug report. But the instructions seem to only work for Precise.\n\nA: An insecure measure: disable SSL\n", "Q: Trouble with an USB modem on Ubuntu 11.10 I need to connect my laptop using an USB modem.

After installation (and on every consecutive plugging) the driver switches the mode internally, the storage device vanishes (in most cases), and a new device (like an USB modem) shows up. Modem maker \"Option\" calls that feature \"ZeroCD (TM)\" since it eliminates the need for shipping a separate driver carrier. \nI would imagine that Ubuntu is detecting your modem as a usb flash drive instead of a modem and that's why gnome-ppp is not detecting it.

Similar to a .bat extension in windows?\n\nA: In Linux those are called scripts of more accurately shell scripts.\nLinux does not care what extension the file, it will look at the file's permissions to find if the file is set as executable and will run it if so.\nYou can create a script with any favorite text editor, just open one up and start scripting, you can use any shell interpreter you want being the normal used ones bash and sh.\nNormally you start your scripts by declaring which command interpreter you want to use, #!/bin/bash for bash and #!/bin/sh for sh. After you have done so you can start typing commands in to the script lines just as you do on Windows with batch scripts.\nAfter you have done editing, save your file and make it executable.\nYou can either open a terminal and type chmod 755 foo (where foo is your script name) or right click on the file you just created and on the permissions tab click in the Make the file executable.\nWhen you are done you can double click on the file and your file manager should try to run it or ask if you want to run it. As an alternative you can also invoke your script in a terminal changing dir to where your script is and invoking it with ./foo.\nA good start to learn Linux shell scripting is LinuxCommand.org, they teach you what you need, how to do it and have a lot of good examples on scripts that you can have a look at.\n\nA: Open your text editor, and type the following line: #! /bin/bash. Leave an empty line and start typing your commands. Save the file, the extension doesn't matter.\n\nGo to the file in your file manager, right-click it, open the properties dialog, go to the permissions tab in the dialog, check the \"Allow execution of this file\", and click the close button. Now you can double-click the file and choose to run it in a terminal window.\n\n\nA: If it is a simple, one-line command, you can create a .desktop file, for example for a straightforward copy command like (in its simpelest form):\n[Desktop Entry]\nName=Simple Copy\nExec=/bin/bash -c 'cp <source> <destination>'\nType=Application\n\nPut the command between quotes, save the file with a .desktop extension, make it executable and run it by double-click.\n\nYou can make a .desktop file more complicated, add options, keywords, set an icon etc.\nSee this link.\n", "Q: Unity or Unity2D, which will be fastest on a high spec computer? I have a decent laptop. i7 quad 2.8, 8gb ram, and Nvidia nvs3100m.\nI wonder which of unity 3d and 2d that would be fastest on my system. Sure its hard to tell.\nAnd the question I'm seeking answer for is the following.\n2d has no 3d effects, bing.\nbut does the 2d desktop execute more work on the CPU rather on the GPU which the 3D desktop.\nAll i want is a snappy desktop, i would love to have a mode, like no effects in the unity 3d. In windows you can choose \"no effects\" which makes everything look terrible but it still an improvement in speed.\nSo would unity 2d clutter the cpu more then unity 3d?\n\nA: Unity2D will.\n\n\n*\n\n*Its lighter on resources.\n\n*Even tough Unity3D uses 3D acceleration for the effects, all the rest is CPU intensive, meaning there is nothing that the 3D symbolizes that actually uses your card to process except the effects. Opening applications, opening the launcher and the Dash are still CPU processed.\n\n\nIn the end, if your graphics card supports it, both are very snappy, but if you are worried about the effect of the looks each option brings Unity2D will be faster and you will not notice the effects of the composed desktop in your media applications (ie: movie watching, online videos, 3D games, etc).\n\nA: The only noticeable difference between Unity and Unity2D will be in comparing graphics and how much FPS you can get in each. Since Unity uses 3D effects it will be heavier in graphics and in memory usage. Unity 2D just removes the 3D effects and as a consequence it lowers A LOT the memory usage in comparison with Unity. This is specially true when you have been using the PC for at least 5 days without rebooting/turning it off.\nSo basically:\nUnity \n\n\n*\n\n*Better Graphics  \n\n*3D Effects for Eye Candy Users  \n\n*More Memory Usage  \n\n*Slightly less FPS when playing a game, using a wine game or something that requires graphic power.\n\n\nUnity 2D \n\n\n*\n\n*Simple Graphics  \n\n*3D Effects for Eye Candy Users ARE GONE!. Simple and lighter.  \n\n*Less Memory Usage  \n\n*More FPS when playing games than compared to Unity.  \n\n\nFor the CPU I have tested both and I can't really say the differ a lot in CPU usage.\nI have tested on a Pentium 4, Core 2 Duo and a Core i7. In all cases the different in CPU was less than 1%. nothing noticeable. But on memory, after 5 days straight you will see the Compiz process in Unity go up to 300mb to 400mb.\nSo for your answer and taking into consideration the CPU you are mentioning and the power behind it. I recommend Unity 3D since you will never notice a different in CPU. Only in graphics but we are talking between 3 to 10fps less (depending on the game). In my case with an Nvidia 8500, an Nvidia 9500 and an Nvidia 440GT the difference was very very little.\nIf you are in the border of 30fps for a game, go with unity 2D. If you have a power packed video card that goes way above 30fps then you can safely choose Unity that it will neither suck your CPU or your video performance. The only one that will be less and less overtime assuming you do not reset the PC in several days will be unity 3D with the compiz process.\nAll in all you can go with Unity.\n\nA: It is very tricky to answer your question when you have the most powerful laptop on a market. In my experience, I would say it would not make a difference for both 2D and 3D Unity. However, you will miss out accessibility features from Unity 2D. \nThe specs you got will do very fine with the processing tasks and effects in any environment. I have dual core Pentium and 4 GB of RAM and I have 3D and it still does fine job. I would recommend 3D for sure.\n", "Q: Any really decent way to get three monitors? What satisfactory solutions are there to achieve three monitors on Ubuntu? I know some ATI cards (Eyefinity) can support 3 monitors from a single card, but I don't know how well this is supported under Linux and besides, I've never had much luck with ATI on Linux.\nThe alternative is to try two cards, but there seem to be problems there too. It looks to me like xrandr cannot support 2 GPUs. I believe you'll end up with two separate \"Screens\" across which you cannot move applications or windows, unless you enable Xinerama which as I understand it disables some acceleration and probably compositing too.\nI've found so much conflicting information on this online, I'm really confused. Please advise!\n\nA: Thanks to Geppetvs for his suggestion, but I have one that is up and running and working very well.\nI have a Sapphire HD6770 fleX Edition card. \nI believe any of the ATI \"Eyefinity\" cards would work. Most of them require a DisplayPort monitor to support 3 displays, or a DP->DVI adapter. The Sapphire fleX cards can work with 2xDVI + 1xHDMI (which can be easily converted to DVI - in fact they supply the adapter in the box).\nThis card supports 3 monitors with the open source \"radeon\" driver without any need to create or edit an xorg.conf file. Standard xrandr tools work with it. 3D acceleration is active (enough to run glxgears and compositing at least) and no xinerama is needed.\nHope this helps someone!\n[P.S. This link was useful https://bbs.archlinux.org/viewtopic.php?id=116502&p=2 ]\n\nA: For triple-monitor support you need to be aware that most non-DisplayPort graphics cards only support two simultaneous outputs, because they only have two PLLs, and hence can generate two pixel clocks. If you use non-DP monitors, it is an important constraint. If you have absolutely identical monitors (same internals, same frequency pixel clock) then some drivers will allow you to share a single pixel clock between two displays (the Intel driver will for sure, and I think AMD's open source driver will). For more details see Wikipedia Intel graphics and three active displays.\nYour options are:\n\n\n*\n\n*Intel HD integrated graphics. Intel GPU comes with your CPU, and is well supported with open source drivers. The Intel drivers can share PLLs for triple-head on non-DP monitors. You will need a motherboard with three video outputs, or laptop with DisplayPort/Thunderbolt ports.\n\n*(for DVI/HDMI monitors) AMD Radeon with a Sapphire FleX card. Sapphire's FleX is a brand name for cards that have a third PLL, and so can support three simultaneous outputs. \n\n*(for DP monitors) AMD Radeon Eyefinity supports upto 6 monitors with the open source radeon driver. You can also use this card with non-DP monitors, but you will need active DP adaptors. For more details see Using six monitors with AMD's open-source driver. \n\n*Nvidia Surround with the closed source driver. According to the answers to the question Linux + “nVidia surround” + 3 monitors? this should work correctly with upto 4 monitors.\n\n*You do not necessarily need multiple video outputs if you have DisplayPort 1.2 monitors or a DisplayPort MST Hub. In this case, you can use a graphics card or laptop with a single DisplayPort output and connect it to multiple DP 1.2 monitors with \"daiy-chaining\", or connect it with a single cable to the DisplayPort MST Hub, and then connect the MST Hub to your monitors. This option is working not quite ready yet - the patches expected to appear in the Linux 3.16 kernel.\nIt should be a lot more common to see this option in the future, as it enables a laptop with single mini-DP connector to drive multiple monitors. (For space and cost reasons, laptops do not usually feature multiple DP ports). \n\nA: Using 2 GPU's can be as expensive as a hardware related solution and for high demanding tasks such as working with more than 2 monitors it would be a better idea considering a solution like the Matrox TripleHead2Go\n\n\n\n\n\nWhich seems to be plug-and-play and the windows/mac compatible software is mentioned for special arrangement/management of your video setup.\nProduct Features and Technical Details\nProduct Features\n\n\n*\n\n*Run two or three monitors from your laptop or desktop computer\n\n*1 VGA input, 3 VGA outputs\n\n*Works with LCDs, CRTs and projectors\n\n*Supports a maximum resolution of 5760x1080 (3x 1920x1080) across\nthree monitors, or 3840x1200 (2x 1920x1200) across two monitors;\ndisplays must run at the same resolution\n\n*Includes one 2-foot HD-15 (analog) monitor cable, one 2-foot DVI-I\nto VGA cable, external 5VDC power adapter, region-specific cable(s),\nand software CD\n\n\nTechnical Details\n\n\n*\n\n*Brand Name: Matrox\n\n*Model: T2G-A3A-AJF-P\n\n*Item Package Quantity: 1\n\n*Graphics Coprocessor: Matrox\n\n\nI am not sure (and you don't mention) what you are going to do with your monitor arrangement, which leads to useful things like audio/video production, programming, and video gaming.\nHowever, using more than 1 GPU may not result in what you expect on performance, different than using only 1 GPU and an external hardware like this. And a solution can be as expensive as the other one. (from $299.99 on BH Photo & Video, more expensive in other places)\nI haven't tested this hardware myself which is indeed cheaper than other hardware. I am using another good solution in order to Perform Multi Monitor real time video-wall using digital inputs but I am talking of a Broadcast Video Mixer similar to this Sony Anycast Station AWS-G500\n\nI am following your question so close in order to find better (and of course: cheaper) solutions, but what I can share is related to broadcast systems, which is high demanding and -sorry- expensive.\nI hope you find a solution soon and if so, please share it with us.\nGood luck!\n\nA: Use a dock (docking station), then install the DisplayLink USB Graphics Software for Ubuntu for your Ubuntu version.

How can I do this?\n\nA: Press Alt + F2 and type alacarte and run.  This is the menu editor and will allow you to make a launcher that not only shows up in the Classic Menu but the Dash as well.  Click on add new item and type in gksu nautilus for the command,select an icon and give it a name like Super Nautilus and click ok.  Now when you click on Dash and start to type nautilus it will show up as one of the Applications\n\nA: Well I don't think that the Dash allows to pass parameters to an app.\nThe only thing I can think of is to add gksu to the main menu (in dash type 'main menu')  but it will not accept any option so you will have to enter the name of the app when gksu opens.\nAt least, that is the default Dash behavior.\n", "Q: Nvidia geforce 6150-unity 3d won't work The Nvidia Geforce 6150 does not work with Unity. What should I do to fix it?\nI am using Ubuntu 11.10.\n\nA: I know this video card is old but I have resolved several older Nvidia card issues using the latest Nvidia drivers.\nTo install the latest drivers (assuming you have alread installed the proprietary drivers from the Additional Drivers app, do the following:\nIn the terminal type: sudo apt-add-repository ppa:ubuntu-x-swat/x-updates\nThen update your repositories by typing in the terminal this: sudo apt-get update.\nAfterwards go to your Update Manager. An updated version of the Nvidia card will appear. Install it and reboot the PC.\nIf you have not yet installed the proprietary drivers then open your dash and type \"Drivers\". The Additional Drivers icon app should appear. Install the Nvidia recommended driver from the list and reboot.\nFrom my experience this has solved a Geforce FX 5600 problem I had, a Geforce 6200 problem and another Geforce 6400.\n\nA: In my case, it was actually a case of removing the NVIDIA drivers.\nMy answer here helped.\nAs a bonus, my whole system seems to be running much much faster. I think the Nvidia driver was buggy and slowing everything down and not recognizing my video card's capability.\n\nA: You could try an older nvidia-173 driver from the repositories. Ii's not a fix, rather a workaround, but it worked for some, according to comments here, ...that is, if you don't mind suspend to RAM not working.\nAs for a proper fix, it seems that anything prior to Geforce 8xxx is considered too old for Unity, which seems like a fair deal. The first 8xxx series were released five years ago, in 2007.\n", "Q: Will installing Ubuntu on one partition affect the files on another? If I create a partition to backup files in windows before installing Ubuntu, is that partition safe after installing Ubuntu?\nAlso I plan on replacing Windows 7 with Ubuntu.\n\nA: Definitively no!\nCreating a new partition for backups, then installing Ubuntu on a separate partition will not affect your files in the backups partition. What you will want to be cautious of is creating the partitions, because if done wrong you can lose all of the data on that drive.\nMy suggestion would be to make your partitions with GParted off the Ubuntu LiveCD.\nhere is a similar question with instructions on how to do this.\n\nA: If I have understood your question correctly you can do the following\n\n\n*\n\n*Have two partitions, one is Windows and second is for data. (FAT32 or NTFS)\n\n*Install Ubuntu on the Windows Partition i.e replace Windows\n\n\nYou can easily install Ubuntu on any partition at install time.\nIf you want your Data partition to be accessible from Ubuntu please see Mounting Partitions. Although I believe the partitions should mount automatically. \nI wouldn't recommend resizing an NTFS partition from within Ubuntu. Gparted is good, but all NTFS support in the linux kernel is reverse-engineered. There's no reason to trust something like a filesystem resize to that when you still have Windows accessible.\nSo My advice for partitioning is that you should use Windows Partitioning tool before installing Ubuntu \n\nA: Ubuntu will not mess with your partitions. However, partitioning in the installation can be a bit confusing.\nSince you want to replace Windows with Ubuntu, you can boot the Ubuntu Live CD, open gparted to format and move partitions, as you see fit.\nFor example:\nYou can wipe the Windows partition and move the data backup partition to include all contiguous empty space. When you install Ubuntu, let it use that empty space.\n\nA: Your partition will be safe when installing Ubuntu but even if you did not create a backup partition, your information would still be safe since installing Ubuntu side by side with windows will not affect Windows in any way (except taking a small amount of space for the ubuntu partitions).\nThe only case I know where you would loose the backup files would be when partitioning the hard drive and a power down would occur. That would be bad luck but not something that would be Ubuntu's fault.\nSo doing a backup partition or installing it side by side would result in the same thing in terms of safety for the information of Windows.\n", "Q: DeVeDe won't open in Ubuntu 11.10 After installing the latest version of VLC player I found that DeVeDe had been removed & would not re-install. After following some advice on this site I managed to purge VLC completely & re-install DeVeDe but now when I try to launch it I get a message saying the program can't find mencoder & will not work without it. I have uninstalled & re-installed mencoder several times in synaptic to no avail, DeVeDe still says it can't find mencoder. Any advice?\n\nA: Take into consideration that the LATEST version of VLC which is the 2.0 right now (Using the PPA for it) has different mplayer, mencoder and other packages than the ones devede, openshot and other programs that use this tools need.\nSo if you are talking about the latest VLC being VLC 2.0 then you probably just changed several packages (mencoder, mplayer, ffmpeg..) with the ones that come with VLC 2.0. This will create a problem for programs like Pitivi, OpenShot and DeVeDe.\nThe only fix I know of is to delete VLC 2.0 and the PPA that brought it. After that update the repositories so the reflect the deletion of the VLC 2.0 PPA. Then install VLC again which will in this case reinstall all the packages that were removed or modified by VLC 2.0.\nIf any of this packages happens to stay just purge it then download it again. In this case you will only have the ones that officially come with Ubuntu so after installing them DeVeDe, OpenShot (in my case when I tested) and Pitivi should all work again.\nA normal step to do this would be:\n\n\n*\n\n*sudo apt-get purge vlc  \n\n*REMOVE PPA FROM VLC 2.0 via Software Sources  \n\n*sudo apt-get update\n\n*Verify that the VLC that is left is the 1.x version: sudo apt-cache show vlc| grep Version. It should say some version that starts with 1.x.\n\n*If the version IS 1.x then: sudo apt-get install vlc if not reboot that PC until she learns how things work around here (Just in case).\n\n\nThis is how I did it to restore all the rest of the programs. If any of them say they are missing X package then just install it. For example if they say they are missing mencoder then sudo apt-get install mencoder.

So, the next step is this:\n\n\n*\n\n*create your keyring, which will be in its own file, ~/.gnome2/keyrings/yourkeyring.keyring\n\n*Create a folder somewhere for your app -- ~/.local/share/yourapp/keyrings perhaps\n\n*move ~/.gnome2/keyrings/yourkeyring.keyring to ~/.local/share/yourapp/keyrings\n\n*place a symlink in ~/.gnome2/keyrings/ pointing to ~/.local/share/yourapp/keyrings/yourkeyring.keyring\n\n*Mark ~/.local/share/yourapp/keyrings as a synced folder with Ubuntu One.\n\n\nThat should do what you want! As noted by RAOF, the keyring file is encrypted, so syncing it to U1 is no security risk. No APIs needed.\nIf you want to do this programmatically -- that is, your app has a \"Sync my app's keyring\" checkbox which turns this feature on and off -- then you will, of course, need to detect U1, and lead the user through signing up if they want to sync but don't yet have a U1 account. For this, use, from Python, ubuntuone.platform.tools.SyncDaemonTool which gives you full control over the Ubuntu One syncdaemon.\n\nA: I can't give a full answer - I'm not familiar with all parts of this.  Some of this answer depends on current implementation details of GNOME Keyring, so may change (but haven't for a number of years).\nUbuntuOne doesn't (currently?) have any specific support for synchronising keyrings, sadly.\nIf you're creating a keyring in the GNOME keyring then that's stored in ~/.gnome2/keyrings/your_keyring_name.keyring.  If you're ok with relying on a GNOME keyring implementation detail, this reduces the problem to \"how can I sync a single file with U1\".\nHere, I can point you at a blog post by Stuart Langridge where he talks about almost exactly this problem.  Particularly, there's an API for U1 files which has python bindings.  It should be reasonably easy to adapt his Save into Ubuntu One script to do what you're after.\nThere shouldn't be anything particular that you need to do, security wise.  The files are private by default, so they're not trivially accessible by random internet users, and the keyring files are encrypted with the password you created it with. \n", "Q: Ubuntu is not listed in boot menu after Wubi installation Win 7 I have installed Ubuntu using wubi in Win 7. When I restart my computer it is not showing the list of ubuntu in the list of operating system. I have checked in My Computer->Properties->Advanced->Under Startup and recovery Settings->time to display operating systems is 10 seconds. Am I doing something wrong?\n\nA: Since you used Wubi, Ubuntu will appear in the Windows boot menu. Press F8 when booting Windows and you should see a menu similar to the image below:\n\nSelect Ubuntu and you are done. Very different from actually installing Ubuntu from the LiveCD where you would have the system completely separate from Windows. For example if something happens to the Windows system like a virus, corruption, boot error, etc.. any problem that eliminates the possibility to boot windows then you will be left temporally without Linux or Windows.\nIn the case of the LiveCD installation like the image below:\n\nIt is less prone to virus/corruption problems.\n", "Q: Unity 2d and 3d both running Ok. I installed Ubuntu 11.10 on my computer and everything works fine. I installed Compiz config Settings, and it shows that the Ubuntu Unity Plugin is unchecked. I researched and found out that I am running Unity 2D (even when i log in under \"ubuntu\"). When I check the Ubuntu Unity Plugin in Compiz, it opens Unity 3d (i assume). But the Unity 2d launcher is still running. They are on top of each other and the icons in the 3D launcher are not visible, however when i run my cursor over them, the bubbles show up (firefox, dash home, etc..) How can I disable Unity 2D and enable just the 3D? And how can i make the icons visible?\n\nA: Installing Compiz Config Settings does not assure you can run Unity 3D. Open a Terminal and type /usr/lib/nux/unity_support_test -p; the output should tell if you can either run or not Unity 3D. This is the output I get:\nOpenGL vendor string:   X.Org\nOpenGL renderer string: Gallium 0.4 on AMD RS780\nOpenGL version string:  2.1 Mesa 7.11\n\nNot software rendered:    yes\nNot blacklisted:          yes\nGLX fbconfig:             yes\nGLX texture from pixmap:  yes\nGL npot or rect textures: yes\nGL vertex program:        yes\nGL fragment program:      yes\nGL vertex buffer object:  yes\nGL framebuffer object:    yes\nGL version is 1.4+:       yes\n\nUnity 3D supported:       yes\n\n\nA: It would help to know the video card you have. If it supports the OpenGL minimum requirements for unity 3D then it will work. If not then even if you change anything in compiz you will not have Unity 3D or any of the effects associated with it.\nIt also helps if your card has a proprietary driver or not. In the cases of Nvidia and Ati cards you have an option to install the proprietary drivers (Via the \"Additional Drivers\" app). But in both cases, the open source drivers that come by default for both of them already work with Unity 3D.\nIn the cases for Intel cards, very old models will have it difficult to work with Unity 3D so they will \"fallback\" to Unity 2D even if you select Unity 3D. This is a way Ubuntu handles the lack of support for the 3D version of Unity in the PC.\nTo install the latest Proprietary or Open source drivers for Ati/Nvidia You can install the PPA here: https://launchpad.net/~ubuntu-x-swat/+archive/x-updates\nAlso look here for more info: How to install ATI Radeon 6770 drivers on 10.04?\n", "Q: Is it possible to create Ubuntu Shirts ( Merchandise ) I wish to create a couple of Ubuntu shirts as prize for a coming event.

Some of them will be similar to the ones in the ubuntu store but others will have other Ubuntu stuff.\n\nA: Yes it is possible, so long as you follow the Trademark policy, the trademark page lists the policies (community advocacy probably applies to your activity).\nhttp://www.ubuntu.com/aboutus/trademarkpolicy\nAdditional information is provided on the following links\nhttp://design.ubuntu.com/assets/ubuntu-logo\nDownloads - http://design.ubuntu.com/downloads?metadata=element-logo+brand-ubuntu\nIf you have questions, Contact Canonical Legal.\n", "Q: Maximizing window makes content disappear I am working on a DV9700 HP laptop. I just installed Ubuntu 11.10 and the proprietary drivers for the Nvidia Geforce 7150M / nForce 630m.\nWhen maximing ANY window, this means the terminal, nautilus, libreoffice, etc.. the content in the windows disappears. I can resize it again to the default and it will show but if I maximize it the content will disappear.\nWhat can be done in this situation.\nUsing Unity. \n\nA: Installing the PPA for nvidia and updating to the latest Nvidia driver has solved the problem.\nIn the terminal I typed: sudo apt-add-repository ppa:ubuntu-x-swat/x-updates\nThen did an update sudo apt-get update and went to the Update Manager. Updated the Nvidia driver, rebooted. Tested. Everything works as it should.\nI need to add that the same PPA also has Ati drivers. This might solve similar Ati problems.\n", "Q: Is it possible to use two file managers at the same time? I have no problem with Nautilus, but i\"m used to Midnight Commander and it would be wonderful if i could have both of them working together. \n\nA: Yes you can run as many as you would like.  Examples: Nautilus, Commander, Dolphin etc...  Below is a link listing the most common ones used in Linux.\nhttp://www.tuxarena.com/2011/06/20-file-managers-for-ubuntu/\n\nA: You can easily install it in your system opening a terminal and typing\nsudo apt-get install mc\n\nor look for mc or midnight commander in the Ubuntu Software Center.\nAfter installing it you can just open the dash and look for it\n\nand you can pin it to the Unity launcher simply by dragging the Midnight Commander icon to the desired position\n\n\nA: Yes, I am using Nautilus (default on Ubuntu 11) and Dolphin together and it works perfectly.\n", "Q: how to find out if my card supports infrastructure mode? My android doesn't see AdHoc networks so I cannot share internet to my phone that way.\nI heard of making a network in infrastructure mode, and I am wondering how to find out if my card supports it.\n\nA: You can check if your device supports AP mode by running \"iw list\" and looking in the 'Supported interface mode*s' section for \"*AP\". See: Wireless Driver Support for AP support.\nThis is the Source\n\nA: use the command:\nsudo iwconfig wlan0 mode master\n\nif it gives the following as output, it means it doesn't support infrastructure mode:\nError for wireless request \"Set Mode\" (8B06) :\nSET failed on device wlan0 ; Invalid argument.\n\nIf it gives no output, it supports the infrastructure mode. Also, just remember to change \"wlan0\" to the actual name of your wireless device. You can get the name using the command ifconfig .\n", "Q: What's being done to make lenses be easily available to users? This is not strictly a question and if it does not meet the criteria for entries on AskUbuntu, it should be deleted. However, I have been thinking on this for a while and thought this would be the best place to get the most eye balls on it.\nI believe Ubuntu is on to something truly unique with the whole lenses and scopes idea. There has been a surge of third party lenses and scopes for doing all sorts of things over the past few months and I believe this is only the beginning. However, one major hindrance is the fact that there is no easy way to discover and install the lenses. One has to follow Ubuntu blogs to find out about them, and then add their individual ppa's in order to be able to install them. \nI suggest that a section should be created for them on the Ubuntu Software Center and the USC can even feature some of them from time to time in order to provide much needed visibility for the third party lenses.\n\nA: (I've retitled your question a bit to make it more answerable, I hope that's ok, normally I think this kind of question is too speculative but you just happened to ask when this is being actively worked on.)\nThe answer right now is that this is a work in progress and right now the Application Review Board and Technical Board need to make some decisions and there is no answer yet and these meetings haven't even occurred yet, but I think your question is valid and there should be a way to do that. \nIdeally of course you'd want to have lenses just available in the software center instead of a huge list of lenses. This needs a few things fixed in the processes in Ubuntu to make it happen:\n\n\n*\n\n*Lenses in particular tie into APIs for web services, these can change at any time, so you can't really package them in the normal archive as they could totally change.\n\n*So we'd like to see lenses submitted via developer.ubuntu.com so that they can be decoupled from the Ubuntu release process. This would allow the lens developers to update their lenses without having to care about Ubuntu distribution policies.\n\n*Ubuntu as a project hasn't really done this kind of thing before so our governance structures and developer workflows aren't set up for this, though it's something we want to fix and are actively working towards.\n\n\n(I'll update this answer when I have more information)\n", "Q: Why we can't run commands with gnome shortcuts? When I make a custom shortcut with gnome (gnome-control-center keyboard) I can't set it to a command. Why?   \nExample: I can't set a shortcut for sudo apt-get update. Instead I must first invoke a graphical terminal, then bash, then execute the command (something like: gnome-terminal -e \"bash -c \\\"sudo apt-get update ; exec bash\\\"\" \nAlso is there another (better) workaround?  \n\nA: You can. You've just shown you can! You can even simplify it a little:\ngnome-terminal -x bash -c \"sudo apt-get update\"\n\nIt needs a terminal because it's interactive (because of sudo). If you just want to suppress the password request, you could edit your /etc/sudoers file so it doesn't require a password for apt-get. In my opinion, this isn't great because it might be abused.\nFor this command there is another option: Aptdaemon. This is what the Software Centre and Update Manager now use for permissions (it uses PolicyKit and it's designed on PackageKit). To update apt, just run:\naptdcon -c\n\nThat shouldn't require a password and if it does, it should be able to pop up a PolicyKit box without needing a terminal to be spawned.\n", "Q: How many lenses can the Dash menu handle I wonder this since there is a max amount of space there. If I install multiple lenses, will it slow down the Dash menu, can I horizontal scroll to see other lenses available? \n\nA: In Ubuntu 11.10 and 12.04, there is no limit to the number of lenses that can be installed.  However, once the amount lens icons exceed the available width, it is not possible to see or select them with the mouse.  They can, however, be navigated to using the keyboard (TAB in 11.10, SHIFT + TAB in 12.04).  There is no horizontal scroll available in the lens bar.\n", "Q: apt-get is giving me errors \nPossible Duplicate:\nHow can I fix a 404 Error using a PPA?  \n\nWhen I run sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get dist-upgrade, I get the following:\nW: Failed to fetch cdrom://Ubuntu 11.10 _Oneiric Ocelot_ - Release i386 (20111012)/dists/oneiric/main/binary-i386/Packages  Please use apt-cdrom to make this CD-ROM recognized by APT. apt-get update cannot be used to add new CD-ROMs\n\nW: Failed to fetch cdrom://Ubuntu 11.10 _Oneiric Ocelot_ - Release i386 (20111012)/dists/oneiric/restricted/binary-i386/Packages  Please use apt-cdrom to make this CD-ROM recognized by APT. apt-get update cannot be used to add new CD-ROMs\n\nW: Failed to fetch http://ppa.launchpad.net/openjdk/ppa/ubuntu/dists/oneiric/main/source/Sources  404  Not Found\n\nW: Failed to fetch http://ppa.launchpad.net/openjdk/ppa/ubuntu/dists/oneiric/main/binary-i386/Packages  404  Not Found\n\nE: Some index files failed to download.

Run the update command to refresh and get the updates.\n", "Q: Scanning from terminal I want to be able to scan from the terminal and then send the scanned output to a specific directory. Can this be done from the terminal.\n\nA: Tested in 18.04 LTS, works fine.\nYou may need to set a scan resolution (150/300/600 dpi). To do this use \"--resolution\" param (this param don't mentioned in scanimage manpage docs). It helps you to reduce the size of produced files.\nExample for 600 dpi scan with png output:\nscanimage \"epson2:libusb:002:003\" --resolution 600 --format=png\nOutput file size difference between 300 and 600 dpi is significant if you scan an image (not text).\nMy values for default A4 image: \n\n\n*\n\n*300 dpi: 2560px * 3150px image, 2-20 Mb *.png file\n\n*600 dpi: 5120px * 7020px image, 30-65 Mb *.png file\n\n\nA: scanimage is installed by default.\nAnd here's me using it:\n$ scanimage -L\ndevice `epson2:libusb:002:003' is a Epson PID 084F flatbed scanner\n\n$ scanimage -d \"epson2:libusb:002:003\" --format tiff > rawr.tiff\n\nObviously that generates a tiff-formatted file. Lossless but usually quite vast. You can convert this down withou an intermediary file by installing imagemagick and then piping the scan output into the convert command:\n$ scanimage -d \"epson2:libusb:002:003\" --format=tiff | convert tiff:- scan.jpg\n\n\nA: Here's a simple command line tool I wrote for myself to scan documents, uses scanimage and imagemagic to scan:\nhttps://github.com/pohape/command-line-scanner\nTo get a JPEG file with the scan result:\n./scan.sh ./test.jpg\nTo get a PNG file with the scan result:\n./scan.sh ./test.png\nTo get a PDF file with the scan result:\n./scan.sh ./test.pdf\n", "Q: Take a picture from terminal I want to be able to take a picture using the webcam from the terminal. This image then will be saved to a file.

It has lots of lovely options for pushing the photos over the Internet.\nIf you want something more manual, and we're talking about a camera supported by V4L/UVC (most of them) you can use streamer to capture a frame from the device:\nstreamer -f jpeg -o image.jpeg\n\n\nA: Using avconv or ffmpeg, you can capture a frame from your device as well. For example:\navconv -f video4linux2 -s 640x480 -i /dev/video0 -ss 0:0:2 -frames 1 /tmp/out.jpg\n\nor\nffmpeg -f video4linux2 -s 640x480 -i /dev/video0 -ss 0:0:2 -frames 1 /tmp/out.jpg\n\nThis will open /dev/video0 as a video4linux2 compatible device, set up resolution to 640x480, stream for 2 seconds (00:00:02 or simply 2), then capture one single frame, saving it to /tmp/out.jpg.\nCheck if your device is /dev/video0, as it can be different for you.\nThe available resolutions depend on your webcam. Mine goes up to 640x480 and I checked it with a tool called qv4l2, which is used to configure a video4linux2 device.\nThe -ss parameter is used to allow the device to start up correctly. Here in my tests, there is a fade-in effect while the camera is being turned on, so, if I just omit -ss 2, the captured frame will be very dark.\n\nA: You can also try uvccapture.\nuvccapture -m\n\n", "Q: What is causing \"Failed to initialize geis instance Aborted\" when trying to run touchegg in Ubuntu 11.10 What is causing \"Failed to initialize geis instance Aborted\" when trying to run touchegg in Ubuntu 11.10?\nI am trying to enable more gesture options for my mac-book touch pad on Ubuntu 11.10, and have come across the touchegg project.

This is in regards with recent and updated versions of Ubuntu. What I mean with this is 11.10 and above.\n\nA: This is possible, technically, but setting it up is by no means a simple operation. To my knowledge there are a few applications available in the repositories for the purpose, but results may vary.\nFor best results, you should actually use an application that natively supports clustering, such as some network renderers and compilers. I don't know of any of these off hand, but I know that for example it is possible to do this with Blender and custom renderers.\nOn the issue of Desktop vs Server - it is easier with the server version, seeing as you have various cloud computing solutions, but if you think about it, you could add these to the Desktop version as well, so maybe your solution would involve using server components on the Desktop.\nUnfortunately, seeing as I have not done this before myself, I cannot (currently) give you concrete instructions.

Flash is incredibly inefficient.  A good way to lose an hour of battery life on your laptop is just leave open a few websites that make use of Flash (even seemingly innocuous uses).  The iPhone/iPad incompatibility issues (and the subsequent Thoughts on Flash commentary by Steve Jobs) have done a lot to bring this topic to the attention of the general public.  Some of it is FUD, but there are good points there, and in any case, the average iPhone user is more than willing to believe The Steve.  \nGoogle is already moving away from using Flash on Youtube; HTML5 works on most videos (those without ads) on most platforms and browsers.  Facebook is heavily encouraging its app developers to use HTML5, and according to my cursory Google search of \"facebook flash\"...it's been a while since someone wrote a tutorial website on developing flash apps for Facebook.\nSimply put, Flash is not seen as desirable by a lot of people.  It is hanging on simply by momentum but a lot of that is getting sapped by the moves of these big game-changing companies.\nIf Flash is still needed in the future for whatever, you can use Chrome.  Opening up an alternate browser once in a while doesn't seem like a big deal for me; I remember having to use Internet Explorer as an alternative to Firefox for things like banking for a couple years until finally everyone caught on and now Firefox is the standard.  At least you can get Chrome for Linux (unlike Internet Explorer).     \n\nA: \nWhat it Means for Users?\nFor Flash Player releases after 11.2, the Flash Player browser plugin for Linux will only be available via the “Pepper” API as part of the Google Chrome browser distribution and will no longer be available as a direct download from Adobe.”\nWhat alternatives are available to us?\nQuoting from WebuUpd8:\nuse an alternative like Gnash or Lightspark (which will hopefully become more reliable) or hope that in 5 years, Flash won't matter and HTML5 will be used pretty much everywhere.\n\nMore.\n\nA: It doesn't mean anything. Flash 11.2 for Linux will be available for 5 years, and the later versions will also continue to be bundled with Google Chrome, so whoever wants it will have to do with that. As for alternatives, there is Gnash.\nPS: Do all Ubuntu fanboys like flash? \n\nA: If you want the latest Flash, just use Google Chrome. Otherwise you will use the old Flash which won't be updated (except for security updates) as stated by Adobe.\n", "Q: Screen sharing not painting properly on client I cannot get the screen sharing utility in Ubuntu 11.10 to work properly. When I connect, I get the initial screen, but no updates. When I connect to my Ubuntu box via a laptop, I can see the mouse moving, but when I click on anything, the screen does not update. \nI can disconnect, reconnect and then see the updated screen, but it does not automatically refresh. How do I fix it?  \n\nA: The VNC server cannot handle the 3D effects. The VNC client actually controls the desktop, but updates don't come back to the VNC client screen. To get the updates to come back to the client do the following: \nOn the server side, log out. Now change the session type. After you have entered your user name,  press the wheel in the upper right corner of the login box and choose \"Ubuntu 2D\" as the session type. \nNow when you log back in, VNC clients will see the changes they make. Any session type that disables 3D effects should work.\n", "Q: The color-coding of file types in my terminal has stopped, help? I was messing around in the terminal earlier and the way file types and directories are color coded has stopped. Now when I pull up a list of all files in a directory, they are all white.  What happened?\n\nA: Launch a terminal and enter ls --color, is the output in color?\nTry logging out of your desktop and back in again, test ls in a terminal again - what happens?\nIf the above hasn't helped you can alias ls to ls --color in ~/.bashrc .. simply add a line to that file : alias ls='ls --color'\n", "Q: How to change the Ubuntu source code I have heard that we can obtain the source code of Ubuntu and customize it as we wish. But where can I find the source code of Ubuntu, and what languages are used to write Ubuntu?\n\nA: The packages and their sources are all available through Launchpad.\n\nA: While Ubuntu is an operating system, it is actually comprised of several different aspects.\nOne aspect is the kernel, the extreme back-end of the operating system.\nAnother aspect is the desktop manager, window manager, etc.\nThen of course there's the programs.\nGenerally speaking, the source for all of these aspects is all open, and freely available.  Most of these have their own projects, and you can download the source code from those projects specifically rather than have to mess around with source packages and stuff.\n\nA: You really don't want to download the source code for all of Ubuntu. That's millions and millions of pages of text – literally. Instead, you'll get the source code for specific packages you're interested in, and that's very easy.\nUbuntu is written in lots and lots of different languages. C, C++, Vala and Python are highly popular, but all kinds of languages are used. Getting the source code for a specific package is very easy. As an example, let's download the source code for the Ubuntu One control panel. Open a terminal and run apt-get source ubuntuone-control-panel\nYou now have the source code for Ubuntu One Control Panel in a directory called ubuntuone-control-panel-VERSION_NUMBER.\nReady to explore? :)\n", "Q: Not recognizing partitioned hard-drive \nPossible Duplicate:\nAccessing Windows partition inside Wubi \n\nRight, here's the situation. I'm experimenting for the first time, so please bear with me. Google has shown no such solutions.\nLenovo W500 laptop. I have my primary hard drive, which is where I keep windows and my windows applications. I also have a secondary hard drive in the cd bay of my laptop. This is where I keep my windows files, and where I told Wubi to put Ubuntu.\nBoot up Ubuntu. I like it. Now I want to listen to music and mess around with my pictures. Except Ubuntu refuses to recognize the hard drive that it is (supposedly) on.\nSolutions?\nThanks\nThanks Uri.\nfor others: files are found in /host under system files.\n\nA: First up I have no experience of Wubi, so I don't know your context.\nAre you saying the from within Ubuntu you can't see any filesystems at all? Or can it not see your windows partition? If thats the case what version of windows / what partitioning & drives are you expecting to see?. Where is the media you are trying to mess about with?\nIf you can bring up a terminal in Ubuntu, you can see the partitions Ubuntu know about (but that may not be mounted) by running sudo fdisk -l or cat /proc/partitions\n", "Q: Can I keep files' revision history? I am looking to purchase additional storage.  However what is important to me is that once I have synced data to the cloud, that if I delete the file locally, it DOES NOT get deleted in the cloud.  Is this possible with UbuntuOne?\nAdditonally I note that I can only sync data from C:/user/nick/documents etc.  I need to be able to sync data from drives other than C: in Windows.  Using Ubuntu I can select what every directories I want.\nOn my Windows machine Drive c: is an SSD drive and therefor I do not keep data on there.  Please can you give me some indication when this restriction on Windows will be lifted.\nI have multiple Machines 2 x Ubuntu 10.10, 2 x Windows 7 Ultimate a Samsung Tablet and an HTC Android Phone. All deveices need to be able to send and receive data to the cloud storage.\n\nA: Ubuntu One is not a backup solution, but a file syncing software. Therefore, if you delete a file from your local device, it will delete it from the servers too.\nAditionally, there is no support for syncing folders outside of your profile on windows.\nSo, Ubuntu One doesn't seem to be the right tool for your situation.\nThere are, however, workarounds for both problems: you may sync a backup of your data. backup to a folder, then sync that one.\n\nA: Ubuntu One doesn't allow you to restore a previous version of a file, but Déjà Dup (called \"Backup\" in Ubuntu) does. And Déjà Dup can backup to Ubuntu One. So yes, you can. Better than dropbox actually.\nOpen the \"backup\" app. Tell it which folder your want it to take care of. Tell it to backup every X and to keep older backup for Y time. Then tell it to backup to Ubuntu One. Setting it up is confusingly easy and not backing up, if only locally, should be a capital offence.\nFor example, I might set it to backup every day and keep the backups for 6 month. If I delete a file accidentally, and I'm online, it will get deleted on my Ubuntu One sync. However, I can just navigate up to the folder containing it, right click it and one of the options available will be \"revert to a previous version\". Could be yesterday, or 3 month ago... Sometimes it takes time to notice a file is missing.\nGoes without saying, it eats up quite some space. It says that it will flush old backups when space starts running out. Haven't tested that.\n", "Q: Update manager always says it is outdated \nPossible Duplicate:\nUpdate information is outdated \n\nThough it installs updates, it always says the update information is some days old and the number of days is increasing daily. I think it keeps on installing some updates repeatedly like Google Chrome beta (approx. 31 MB).\n\nA: Update manager shows the time since last successful updates check from all of update repositories. So if it continually fails to access at least one updates source it will still show the time since all were successfully accessed.\nI would recommend you to run an update in a terminal (sudo apt-get update) and see which repository is not accessible. You can then disable it or fix it and run update manager again. \n\nA: Based on whatever applications you have installed the Ubuntu OS will have multiple updates daily on various packages, including the OS itself.  This is a very common occurrence and should not be worried about.  However... If you want you, can open Update Manager and under Settings you can set how often to Check for Available Updates.  I have mine set on every 2 days but you can set it for weekly, bi-weekly, or never.  \nNote: If you select the never option updates will not be checked unless you click on the Check for Updates button. \n", "Q: Text Editor with FTP I'm new to Ubuntu. Is there a text editor with built in FTP out there that anyone can recommend to me? I am trying to use Bluefish right now.\n\nA: Gedit will see any saved bookmarks you make in Nautilus. So in Nautilus you can File>Connect to Server   and then Bookmark that location once it opens.\nGedit will see those bookmarks and can open right to your files. You can also install some additional plugins and options for Gedit to show line numbers, snippets and find/replace.  \nWorks great.\n", "Q: How do I set windows to boot as default in the boot loader?

It will allow you to change the order in Grub, which is all you need to do since the first item boots by default.  Choose the Preferences icon, and a window will open: the first setting listed is \"default entry\"; use the dropdown next to it to choose your Windows boot, close the window and Grub Customizer, reboot and Windows should be listed first and will therefore be the default.\n\n", "Q: How to copy from one buffer to another in gstreamer? I am trying to copy from the original buffer buf (in the chain function) to another buffer created using:\nGstBuffer *buffer;\nglong size;\n\nsize = GST_BUFFER_SIZE(buf);\nbuffer = gst_buffer_new ();\nGST_BUFFER_SIZE (buffer) = size;\nGST_BUFFER_MALLOCDATA (buffer) = g_malloc (size);\nGST_BUFFER_DATA (buffer) = GST_BUFFER_MALLOCDATA (buffer);\nmemcpy(buffer,buf,size);\n\nBut I get a segmentation fault. Is there anything wrong here?\n\nA: Rather than writing to the data the GstBuffer is managing, you're overwriting the GstBuffer object itself with your final memcpy call.  Instead, you want to write to GST_BUFFER_DATA (buffer).\nWith that said if you just want a new buffer with the same data, it would seem easier to just use the gst_buffer_copy() function.\n\nA: GstBuffer *buffer;\nglong size;\nsize = GST_BUFFER_SIZE(inp);\nbuffer = gst_buffer_new();\nGST_BUFFER_SIZE(buffer) = size;\nGST_BUFFER_MALLOCDATA(buffer) = g_malloc(size);\nGST_BUFFER_DATA(buffer) = GST_BUFFER_MALLOCDATA(buffer);\nbuffer = GST_BUFFER_DATA(inp);\n\n// Now you can use the data pointed by buffer to say write it in a file using fwrite\n", "Q: Desktop Icon Problems with Rotated Unity I have an odd problem that I'm attributing to the Rotated Unity Plugin.\nI can't move any desktop icons any further than where it lies on the left in the following screenshot:\n\nThat \"barrier\" is where the old launcher used to be. However, observe the next screenshot:\n\nHere, you can see that the icon can go down into the launcher. I think that the old settings for the normal launcher are implicated though the plugin moved the launcher itself. Any ideas? I'm still a Linux Novice.\n\nA: The launcher still moves to become visible when set to auto-hide, and you are supposed to be able to drop things onto it. At the very least, you should be able to drop things from your desktop and into the waste bucket, which would be impossible if the launcher weren't displayed when you drag something to it. \nHowever, when you move the launcher, the area used to reveal the launcher must also be changed. This appears not to be the case in the software you're using.

Even if I replace the power plug, the laptop shuts down within thirty seconds. If I disable wireless capability, I am able to run the laptop for an absolute maximum of five minutes on battery powers before receiving the same message. I have tried running with Jupiter on Power Saver mode, but to no noticeable effect.\nIgnoring the fact that I can't use my laptop without being attached to a power source, I really do enjoy using Ubuntu, and hence would greatly appreciate any help that can be offered.\n\nA: Just stay plugged in. If you only use it at home then that should be easy. But if you don't want to pay a huge power bill then try reducing screen brightness. Usually at lowest screen brightness when unplugged I get about 3 hours of battery. But then again I am a Compaq Presario CQ56.\nI know this because I have lowered my screen brightness unplugged. If you deleted Windows and installed Ubuntu then search your power specs on-line. If you still have Windows you should be able to view your power specs by booting Windows and going to control panel.\nHope this helps.\n(P.S. I no longer use Windows. I replaced Windows with Ubuntu.)\n\nA: The problem is not that your battery is empty but that Ubuntu thinks that it is empty and shuts down. This can happen especially with old batteries. If you disable the automatic shutdown on critical power you should be able to use it nearly as long as under Windows. I don't know how to do this in 11.10 but take a look at this or try google if it doesn't work ;-)\nThe downside is that you can't see the remaining time and at some point you laptop will just turn itself of without a warning.\n", "Q: Printer drivers on KONICA MINOLTA PP 1350e I had an older printer but can't find drivers.

I had a FreeBSD machine and it had a /usr/sbin/daemon command which could run my program in the background.  \nThe question is how to do something similar in Ubuntu? I would like something I can put in a startup script.\nWhat I mean is my program can't put itself in a background when starts.  \nI tried:\nstart-stop-daemon --start --quiet --pidfile $PIDSPATH/$PIDFILE --exec $DAEMON\n\nBut it just starts the program and I must wait for it to finish.\n\nA: Use the --background option of start-stop-daemon. From the manual page of start-stop-daemon(8):\n\n-b, --background\n  Typically  used  with  programs  that  don't  detach on their own.\n  This option will force start-stop-daemon to fork before starting the\n  process, and force it into the background.  WARNING: start-stop-daemon\n  cannot check the exit status if the process fails to execute for\n  any  reason.  This  is  a last resort, and is only meant for programs\n  that either make no sense forking on their own, or where it's not\n  feasible to add the code for them to do this themselves.\n\nIn a shell, programs can be backgrounded with & as in:\n$ myprogram &\n[1] 5042\n\n\nA: If you're just looking to run something and detach it (so it runs in the background) there are half a dozen methods that I evaluated yesterday. The easiest is just to wrap the command in parenthesis:\n(command)\n\nYou can close the terminal and move on with life and the application will keep running. There's obviously no control over the process now short of looking it up and nuking it (kill, killall, etc), or it quitting itself.\nIf you need something a bit more elegant, I'd look at upstart scripts. Upstart is the replacement for the System V init system (ie the files in /etc/init.d/). To give you an idea of how an Upstart script looks, you can see the existing Upstart jobs in /etc/init/.\nThere's a lovely cookbook of examples on the Upstart website:\n\n\n*\n\n*http://upstart.ubuntu.com/cookbook/\n", "Q: Slow Resume After suspend having chrome running with many tabs I usually use chrome and Firefox for browsing. I also open many tabs (around 40 in both some times).\nThe problem I have occurs when I resume the PC after having suspended it: It takes from 2 to 5 minutes sometimes to just get back normally.\nDoes this have to do with memory usage not properly resuming? Is it a bug in Chrome/Firefox or Ubuntu itself? \nNote that I just upgraded from 10.10 to 11.10 and I was having the problem on both releases, which makes me guess that it has to do with Ubuntu not resuming well if some memory-heavy apps were running before the suspend occured.\n\nA: I think this could be expected.  Hibernation / resume time depends on the amount of RAM the system has, regardless of how much of the RAM is actually used. It makes no difference whether you have 1 or 100 programs open, it will still take the same time.  \nAfter getting a new high-end notebook that seemed slower on resuming than my older notebook I learned that the more RAM a system has, the more time it will take to hibernate and resume. There is also data compression / decompression involved in hibernating so this is also a factor if you have more stuff in memory.  A few minutes wait time is to be expected,   and on high end - ram packed machines it does take longer.\nHope this helps, cheers! \n\nA: The issue is not the RAM size, it just depends on the amount of programs you have running. \nI've been using my computer for about 2 hours now and have some programs open (total RAM usage for all this incl kernel is 700MB) Chrome is open with 6 tabs (another 900MB RAM). \nHibernate takes 30 seconds, wakeup takes 2 minutes before the system is fully responsive (same moment disk activity LED stops burning). However, kernel messages show that hibernation finished after just 20 seconds and indeed, after those 20 seconds i could see my desktop and move the mouse, it's just that the systeem remains quite unresponsive and especially Chrome.\nClosing chrome (it runs in the background so you need to click the task-bar icon and exit to 'really' close it, or just kill the processes) makes wake-up go to 30 seconds. Opening up chrome again and opening 6 tabs takes it back up to 1m50. \nIt's just a matter of what programs you have running and chrome appears to be a really heavy factor in that. \n", "Q: How to replace Mutter with Compiz to enable Wobbly effect? I'm running Ubuntu 11.10 with Gnome shell, because Unity is too slow. Is there a way I can enable extra visual effects which I had in Lucid Lynx? How can I replace my Windows managers? I prefer to use Gnome 3 or Gnome classic if Compiz works.  Thanks!\n\nA: From the Gnome 3 Myths page:\n\nI can't use Compiz with GNOME Shell!\nBecause the GNOME Shell project wanted \"tighter integration\" between the panel and window manager than cooperating with the Compiz project would allow, this could actually be true. This mailing list post has more information.\n\nGnome Shell relies on Mutter to do its fancy work, just as Unity (3D) relies on Compiz. You can't mix and match unfortunately.\nThis might get fixed in time but I wouldn't hold my breath.\n\nGnome Classic does work with Compiz though. If you're happier with a panel-based setup and want the wobblyness, you can turn compiz on by running compiz --replace.\nTo turn on wobbly windows, I suggest you install compizconfig-settings-manager and then run ccsm to change the compiz settings. A word of warning: CCSM is a powerful tool without any safety latches. It's quite easy to break Compiz with it so if you do ever get stuck, you can reset your settings by running:\ngconftool-2 --recursive-unset /apps/compiz\n\n\nA: Just install Compiz from the Ubuntu Software Centre, and run compiz --replace. That should do (it if your hardware is supported).\n\nYou can open a Run dialog by pressing Alt+F2.\n", "Q: Can't mount cds after failed Brasero burn Brasero failed to burn a disk recently, and now I can't access CD-ROMS.

The table appears offset in Ubuntu (using Firefox and Chrome) ie the input boxes do not match with the vertical input descriptions. Consequently, the table is longer than it should be and the input boxes don't match up with the input descriptions. This does not happen on my Arch box - the table renders perfectly. I don't know where to start looking for a solution to this problem.\nArch is currently using Firefox 10 but this problem has been present for quite a number of months and version upgrades of Firefox. What happens is this : there are two input cells side by side (where I add results of football (association) matches. These cells align with a team name eg\nTeam One [input 1] [input 2]\nTeam Two [input 1] [input 2]\n\nFirefox in Arch renders the page as intended. The input cells are aligned with the team names. This also works in Firefox in Windows.\nIn Ubuntu, the cells are displayed on top of each other :\nTeam One [input 1]\n[input 2]\n\nThis, unfortunately, causes the input boxes to become misaligned ie they are no longer next to the team they are associated with.\nTeam One [input 1]\nTeam Two [input 2]\n[input 1]\n[input 2]\n\nMatching teams with the correct input boxes becomes a nightmare. Aaaaargh.\nI can't give you a link because it's a password protected site. Here's what it should look like:\nhttp://i39.tinypic.com/2ev8bi1.png\nHere's what it looks like in Ubuntu 11.10 using Firefox 10\nhttp://i41.tinypic.com/ebdgr7.png\nI have installed the Microsoft font set and also used my Firefox config from Arch in Ubuntu, but the problem persists.\n\nA: Without seeing the exact CSS, it seems that the tables use different fonts. (Compare capital „B”s or „1”s for example.)\nA few things you can try:\n\n\n*\n\n*Try to specify the exact same font with pixel sizes in your CSS, and see if it makes a difference.\n\n*Use Firebug to inspect the dimensions / paddings of the input boxes. Use a CSS reset stylesheet to even out the browser differences.\n\n*Modify the layout to be able to accomodate a few pixel differences in font sizes.\n\n*Use tables for tabular data. If you had a table row for a team, the cells should not be misplaced vertically.\n\n\n\nIf you don't have access to the source code of the website, you still have options to modify the appearance.\n\n\n*\n\n*The Stylish extension will modify the appearance (CSS) of the web sites (and according to the add-on page, even Firefox itself). By writing user style sheets, it is up to you to modify the look to your liking.\n\n*Greasemonkey on the other hand is a universal weapon to change anything on the web page (including the HTML structure) by using JavaScript. If you can code an algorithm for the problem, no one is going to stop you from changing the page the way you like it.\n\n\nAnother way to address the problem is to change the appearance or the theme you are using in your OS. GUI programs use the widgets of the operating system* to display buttons, checkboxes and input fields, etc.\nSo in most cases changing the theme will change the fonts / paddings / sizes of input boxes.\n*) Not exactly that simple but the point is the widget appearance is borrowed by your browser. That's why it looks native.\n", "Q: Tool for managing unity panel applets I found many unity applets from another question \nIs there any tool to manage them as in the case of gnome2 ?\nie, moving applets ,enabaling and disabling applets from a list etc \n\nA: Unity does not have applets, as you suppose. They are separate applications which show indicators, and there is no central place to manage them, reason being that they are meant to manage themselves.\nIf you want to add or remove indicators, you either run or quit the application(s) as needed. Some applications also provide the option to disable the application indicator.\n", "Q: How do I stop Geoip from connecting to the internet every time I boot? I'm trying out ubuntu 12.04 and I noticed that a process called Geoip is connecting to the internet at every boot/login. Why is this necessary?

Happy days, no more geoip connections. \nDisclaimer: I don't know if there any negative effects of disabling geoip provider connections in the way described above, because I still don't fully understand why this connection must call home.\nSee the SO question I have permanent connections to Canonical servers, what are they for? for more details.\n\nA: There is currently no way to disable the geoip check.  It is currently used to determine if your timezone has changed.  In the future we should really add an option to disable it or at least reduce the dependency on the geoclue-ubuntu-geoip package to a recommends so users can just un-install that.  I just tested that and it breaks indicator-datetime, I will make sure that gets addressed for 12.10.\n", "Q: How to create Ubuntu *Server* bootable USB drive using YUMI? This article suggest to select Ubuntu Server 10.04 from the list in YUMI(I'm using windows edition). However, the latest YUMI does not have Ubuntu Server 10.04 in the list. The only Server version is available in the list is 11.00, which I am not interested in.\nAnyone knows how to create 10.04 Server drive with YUMI? \n\nA: You have two options, the easiest is try putting your ISO in YUMI's run directory. Supposedly it can auto-detect it.\nOr you can manually install it alongside (I assume) your other BootCD's on the USB. It's actually a pretty simple process, especially with Ubuntu (others require hacking of the initramfs and mounting and other crazy stuff...)! So, you're lucky to get out easy on this one! Haha!\nSo, here's what you do:\n\n\n*\n\n*Download the 11.04 Server ISO from releases.ubuntu.com\n\n*Extract the CD to a subdirectory of your flash drive.\n\n*Find the syslinux menu. It's called either syslinux.cfg or isolinux.cfg. It will be the one loaded in either /syslinux.cfg /boot/syslinux.cfg /boot/syslinux/syslinux.cfg (or /isolinux.cfg, /boot/isolinux.cfg, /boot/isolinux/isolinux.cfg).\n\n*Add these lines:\nlabel ubuntu\nmenu title Ubuntu Server 10.04\nconfig /ubuntudirectory/isolinux.cfg\n\n\n*In /ubuntudirectory/isolinux.cfg (or /ubuntudirectory/boot/isolinux.cfg) on every append or initrd (it can be either) add this kernel option to the end: directory=/ubuntudirectory/casper\n\n\nThat's it! Try running it in Qemu (use -snapshot!) to be sure if you don't feel like rebooting.\n", "Q: What music players (or related applications) are there that would allow displaying/editing embedded lyrics of music tracks? I use OSD Lyrics and CoverGloobus. They are good, they search and eventually download lyrics, when they can find them. The sources used by OSD Lyrics, for example, are rather limited (although I love the way it displays them. The latter accesses a reacher database, but the display is not adjustable as far as I know). Couldn't find a way to make these programs see lyrics from a file selected by me.\nWhat I want is to be able to add the lyrics myself, and even to embed them into the music file - and, of course, to display them from there. The last feature alone would be very valuable to me,  as I have a large music database with lyrics already embedded, but I cannot see them with these programs: they are just looking for new lyrics on the Internet, although the lyrics are on my computer. \nIn Windows I used Foobar2000 to find, display and embed lyrics (with the add-on lyricsgrabber) and when I needed to add the lyrics manually I used to embed them in MediaMonkey (this player allows finding them, but also editing and embedding - just by copy/paste). I am not able to run MediaMonkey in Wine. Foobar works, but with a lot of problems. And anyway, Wine is of last resort. \nI am looking for a Linux program that would be able to do something similar to what I have described above.\n\nA: I use aTunes, which is a java-based Music Player, that also fetches lyrics from an internet-database for most of my music. It is highly customize-able, meaning, that you can change the column view(s) to your liking, add different lyric sources, add/play radio stations etc..  \n\n\nThe lyrics are stored here: ~/.atunes/aTunes.log.\nHowever, it is even easier to add new lyrics and edit older once (i forgot to mention it in the first place).\n\n\n*\n\n*Right click on your track of choice and choose either Edit Tag or Set Lyrics automatically from the pop-up dialog.\n\n*In your case it would be Edit Tag, which opens another dialog, where you can copy/paste your lyrics to, which are then shown like suggested in the next screenshot (under Song)\n\n\n\nYou also request quick access to specific tracks, which can be archived through the Filter search-filed or by changing the view option of the column. As you can see in the screenshot below, there are a few great features, like:\n\n\n*\n\n*Song\n\n*Album\n\n*Artist\n\n*YouTube\n\n*Similar\n\n*and another one, which you can look up yourself (:\n\n\n\nInterface GUI:\n\n\n\nA: Have you looked at Quod Libet? (disclaimer: I'm one of the current devs). It's popular with a lot of ex-Foobar2000 users.  QL (plus associated tagger Ex Falso) has lyrics support via text files linked to the lyrics (for cross-format support mainly). These are editable in-place (via \"Information\", somewhat confusingly)\nThere is also now a viewlyrics plugin too for automatically viewing the current song's lyrics. You don't mention audio formats, if it's mp3, there are recent talks of supporting embedded ID3 lyrics, so add your support there if you're interested.\n\nA: gmusicbrowser comes with a Lyrics plugin.\nsudo apt install gmusicbrowser\n\nOnce activated on the Settings/ Plugins page, it can use lyrics embedded in the .mp3 file, or from a downloaded lyrics file, or it tries some download sites.\n", "Q: How to save the current Xorg configuration to Xorg.conf?

Again, you need root permissions which you can activate by using sudo, you can do sudo mv xorg.conf xorg.conf.backup1 to rename the file in the command line. you can do the same, but reverse the names to name it back. You can open the file for editing with a program like vim or pico by typing sudo pico xorg.conf granted that you are in the /etc/X11 folder.\nYou then have to restart the xserver which you can do by loging out of your account and logging back in, or type in unity in the terminal, which is the same as unity --replace, that should restart your X11.\n", "Q: Installation only recognizes 3 GB of memory after RAM upgrade \nPossible Duplicate:\nWhy does Ubuntu only show 3GB of RAM? \n\nI recently upgraded my system from 2 to 4 GB of memory.

There's also some business about a generateduid, but that's not what you want, so ignore that.\nAnd to check ownership of the home folder, I used stat /media/OSX/Users/someone.\n\nA: Your non-sensitive user information is stored in the /etc/passwd file on your Mac OS just as in other *nix systems. (This information is confirmed by this link). So you could use the following steps to retrieve the UID of a user.\n\n\n*\n\n*Mount your Mac OS partition. In that look for a file called passwd\nin the etc folder of your Mac. In other words, open the\n/etc/passwd file of your Mac OS.\n\n*Scroll and find your username\n\n*The third number in the line corresponding to your username should be the UID of that user. For example, my username is nits and my UID is 1000 and my GID is 1000 too\nnits:x:1000:1000:nits,,,:/home/nits:/bin/bash\nFor more information on the /etc/password file, look into this blog post on *nixCraft\n", "Q: How do I run a script once and only once in Upstart?

Run it and forget it,\nWhat is the same type of software for backing up the Ubuntu system? I tried DUP back up but it failed to restore when I really needed it.\nCan you suggest anything regarding system back up for Linux systems?\n\nA: To create an image of a disk is very easy. Let's say you want to create an image of sda in /media/my_dev_sdb: \nsudo dd if=/dev/sda of=/media/my_dev_sdb/disk_sda.img. \nIf it's your main disk, then it's wise to boot a live session and do it from there instead. \n\nA: You could also check out CloneZilla. You can install cloneZilla from the download links present on the main site. Excerpt from the site as to what clonezilla is mentioned below. You can also take a look at some screenshots of the application in action\n\nWhat is CloneZilla?\nYou're probably familiar with the popular proprietary commercial\n  package Norton Ghost®. The problem with these kind of software\n  packages is that it takes a lot of time to massively clone systems to\n  many computers. You've probably also heard of Symantec's solution to\n  this problem, Symantec Ghost Corporate Edition® with\n  multicasting. Well, now there is an OpenSource clone system (OCS)\n  solution called Clonezilla with unicasting and multicasting!\nClonezilla, based on DRBL, Partclone and udpcast,\n  allows you to do bare metal backup and recovery. Two types of\n  Clonezilla are available, Clonezilla live and Clonezilla SE\n  (server edition). Clonezilla live is suitable for single machine\n  backup and restore. While Clonezilla SE is for massive deployment, it\n  can clone many (40 plus!) computers simultaneously. Clonezilla saves\n  and restores only used blocks in the harddisk. This increases the\n  clone efficiency. At the NCHC's Classroom C, Clonezilla SE was used to\n  clone 41 computers simultaneously. It took only about 10 minutes to\n  clone a 5.6 GBytes system image to all 41 computers via multicasting!\n\nYou could also take a look at this question - How to make a disk image and restore from it later\n\nA: Try backintime-gnome .\n\nIt is a a good program for making backups of individual folders or entire drives.\nThe project's site is here: http://backintime.le-web.org/\n\nA: You could try remastersys!

I have an Acer Aspire 5935G. It comes with hybrid grahics solution from Nvidia. It has two graphic cards; Nvidia GeForce 130GT M (discrete) and Intel mobile graphics series 4. I have just installed Ubuntu 11.10 but I get no information about what graphics card the notebook is currently using. Also how can I use only one of them permanently (preferably Intel graphics), while disabling the other?\n\nA: By default optimus is not supported in ubuntu so you are probably using your intel card if you havent installed bumblebee. if you want to use optimus you can use the bubble bee projects to run particular programs through the nicer nvidia GPU. it uses a virtual framebuffer to reroute the whole thing. Pretty tricky stuff but relatively transparent to the end user. \nhttp://www.bumblebee-project.org/\n", "Q: After 12.04 release would 10.04 still be LTS? Silly question, but given that I have upgraded and downgraded from Lucid to Natty and back, and after some months of anticipation, Lucid to Oneiric then back, would the LTS cycle of Lucid end in April?\n\nA: You can check here for all the releases and their end of life/schedule and stuff like that - https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Releases\nAccording to it, the end of life for Ubuntu 10.04 Lucid Lynx is \n\n\n*\n\n*April 2013 for the Desktop version\n\n*April 2015 for the Server version\n\n\nBe clear, that end of life does not mean that Lucid Lynx will be unusable but just that it won't be receiving any active important security updates after that date. \n\nA: 10.04 will end it's LTS life cycle (As mentioned in the Ubuntu Wiki: https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Releases) in:\n\n\n*\n\n*April 2013 (Desktop)  \n\n*April 2015 (Server)\n\n\nThe reasons behind this life cycle are here: https://wiki.ubuntu.com/LucidLynx/ReleaseManifest but basically it is 3 years Desktop versions and 5 years Server versions.\nSo you still have some more time to stay with it and enjoy it.\nWhen 10.04 ends it will be remembered. I enjoyed many weekends with it. He always gave it the best he could.\nLong live 10.04!\n\nA: 10.04LTS will be supported until April 2013 on the desktop and Apri 2015 on the server. That's 3 and 5 years of support, respectively. New releases doesn't change anything. From 12.04LTS, the support will be five years on both server and desktop, hence it'll be supported until April 2017, though the plan is to release new LTS releases in 2014 and 2016. \n\nA: If your LTS is deployed on a work bread and butter machine, its always wise to be slow and steady, hold on for six months and then do a fresh clean install of 12.04 Precise Pangolin.\n", "Q: Interactive Firewall I have Ubuntu Server 10.04 serving as router/firewall with iptables. Also have number of client computers in LAN. So far so good.\nNow what I need is some sort of interactive firewall software on server, which I can turn on and it will ask me to allow/disallow outgoing connection (from console) from my particular LAN PCs through firewall to internet. Ultimate goal is to suspend all kind of suspicious connections/calls to home. Currently this job is done using Little Snitch on each MacOS computer, causing additional load on each client to monitor for outgoing traffic (not to mention that it's paid app). So I thought maybe it's possible to centralize it on my Ubuntu Server.\n\nA: Such a firewall does not exist on Linux. The netfilter/IPtables firewall system cannot filter applications. \nUbuntu users have been asking for the creation of a program that can filter applications and log internet connections. Currently, there is suggestions and discussion about possibly using AppArmor coupled with IPtables to fulfill this need.

I found some great tutorials, and installed Quickly and started to play around with app development. For some reason though, when I typed in \"Quickly create ubuntu-application hello-world\" like the tutorial said, the terminal window said the normal \n\"Creating project directory hello-world\nCreating bzr repository and committing\nLaunching your newly created project!\"\nBut then said (hello-world:23506): Gtk-WARNING **: Unable to locate theme engine in module_path: \"pixmap\",\n(hello-world:23506): Gtk-WARNING **: Unable to locate theme engine in module_path: \"pixmap\",\n(hello-world:23506): Gtk-WARNING **: Unable to locate theme engine in module_path: \"pixmap\",\n(hello-world:23506): Gtk-WARNING **: Unable to locate theme engine in module_path: \"pixmap\",\nThe \"hello world\" application launched seemingly fine after that, but is it a problem?

My host operating system is Ubuntu 11.10 and guest is Ubuntu 10.10.\nOn my server I can already ping www.example.local - so I configured my virtual host correctly.\nQuestion is, how can I address www.example.local from outside my VirtualBox? I searched Google and AskUbuntu and found dnsmasq.\nI installed dnsmasq on my server and followed all steps on help.ubuntu. On my host system I've set 192.168.178.91 to the list of DNS servers (192.168.178.91 is the IP address of my local server which uses a bridged network adapter).\nThing is, I still cannot ping (or connect to) my example.local virtual host. It gives me an unknown host response.\nHow can I set up my DNS server correctly?\n\nA: If hostname.local on your local network is the goal, then you don't need to do anything. You can just connect to it. If your laptop is named mylaptop, for instance, just connect to mylaptop.local. It's done using Avahi out of the box.\n\nA: On the host, you probably have the dns server set in /etc/resolv.conf to a different machine (like your router or your isp DNS). You can change it to your virtual server after running it but since the virtual server will be loaded after the host obviously, if you make the change permanent, you won't have DNS before loading the virtual server and this can be a problem. On other machines, you can make this change permanent.\nAnyways, before changing anything, you could just test if the DNS server is working well by issuing on the host machine:\nnslookup www.example.local 192.168.178.91\nand see if it works.\n", "Q: How do I get to the options in nvlc?

This should do:\n#! /bin/sh\n# run nvlc in monochrome mode\ngnome-terminal -x nvlc --no-color\n\nput this in your path, like /usr/local/bin/vlcmc (for vlc MonoChrome or whatever you prefer) and make the file executable.

It should now be executable like any other app.\nFrom here you can also pass the --window-with-profile=[PROFILE] option to terminal, so you can customize the colors/fonts/transparency for your nvlc instance.\n", "Q: Why doesn't Ubuntu detect all of my RAM on 64-bit? \nPossible Duplicate:\nUbuntu only detects 3.1 GB of ram on Ubuntu 64 bit \n\nISSUE IDENTIFIED: BIOS bug.  See dmesg output below.\nQuestion is: How to resolve this?  Change made since 2.6.32 have introduced this.  Is there a patch Canonical or the kernel maintainers can provide to fix this?  Who do I refer this to?\nThanks everyone!\nORIGINAL QUESTION:\nI think there is an issue with the 64-bit 2.6.35 kernel that ships with Ubuntu 10.10.  I have a Gigabtye GA-970A-UD3 with an AMD FX-8120 processor, 16GB DDR3-1333, nVidia GTX550Ti and an OCZ Agility 3 120GB SSD.  \nI installed Ubuntu 10.10 on it to get SSD TRIM support with the 2.6.35 kernel.  However, after successful OS install, System Monitor only reports 3.2GB.  It sees the 8 cores of the FX-8120 and the uname -a reports x86_64.  Furthermore, dmidecode shows the four banks of memory being filled.  Suspecting memory, I swapped out the 16GB for 8GB from a different manufacturer but still the same issue exists.  10.10 with a 2.6.35 kernel won't see more than 4GB on 64-bit.\nI have a 64-bit 10.04 LTS install on an i7-960 with 24GB RAM and it sees all 24GB.  When I boot the 64-bit 10.04 LTS on the FX-8120 machine, it sees all 16GB and 8 cores.\nClearly something has changed between 2.6.32 and 2.6.35 to affect the memory support.  \nI am after the TRIM support of 2.6.35 but not at the cost of losing 75% of my RAM.  I am looking for some guidance or suggestions.  Is a new kernel flag required or do I need to get a custom build of 2.6.33 onward to resolve the TRIM support and memory issue simultaneously.\nAny help appreciated!\nUPDATE: The version of 10.04 LTS installed is whatever ISO the Ubuntu download site provides for the 10.04 64-bit release.  I have turned on \"Download Updates\" while installing so whatever 10.04 LTS currently does on a clean install with that ISO is what I am running.  I can provide outputs for whatever commands are requested to determine the exact builds/revisions this machine is on.  I am also going to test boot 10.10 on my i7-960 to see if it reports 4GB vs. 24GB.

The 2.6.32 kernel that ships with 10.04 works correctly with the hardware in seeing all of the available memory.\nI started with a 10.04 LTS build that is seeing 16GB RAM.  Then I upgraded to a 2.6.33 kernel via kernel.ubuntu.com and memory fell to 3.2GB.  dmesg output reports:\nWARNING: BIOS bug: CPU MTRRs don't cover all of memory, losing 13040MB of RAM\n\nFollowed by the kernel trace information for the exact area of the kernel source code that has the issue.\nAt this point, it no longer matter whether I am on 10.04 or 10.10.  Once the kernel version passes 2.6.32, this issue manifests.  It is not a problem with the FX processor.  Even the 2.6.32 kernel recognizes it correctly with the proper number of cores.  The Gigabyte GA-970A-UD3 BIOS does not have an option to perform memory remapping so it is probably doing it by default.\nBooting Ubuntu 11 on a 3.0 kernel causes the machine to freeze on hardware detection.  I have not yet tried the 12.04 alpha release.\nThe logical solution to allow 2.6 kernels to run on bugged hardware like my motherboard is to patch arch/x86/kernel/cpu/mtrr/cleanup.c in later kernels to use the older 2.6.32 code that doesn't perform the MTRR check.  Research indicates the MTRRs are legacy components via the BIOS and appear to be safe to disable.  \nThis will also allow users of newer hardware to running the older Linux 2.6 based systems with later drivers and support SSDs correctly.  \nMy next step is to pull down the sources for the 2.6.33 kernel I am using along with 2.6.32 and look into performing the patch to see what happens.  Note that I am not a kernel developer and my C is rusty but I can work well enough to give this a try.  Should it work, I will see into posting a patch to the kernel maintainers.\n", "Q: What steps should I take when I find wrong information in the Ubuntu wiki pages? I sometimes end up in a Ubuntu wiki page when looking for information. Most of the times that information is a bit out dated, which is fine, others its mostly wrong or does not reflect the actuality.\nIf I find information on the Ubuntu wiki that is very wrong or even considered dangerous what steps should I take to try to fix it?\n\nA: Just like Ask Ubuntu, if something is wrong, fix it. :)\nIf the page is so bad it can't be fixed, consider tagging it for deletion:\n\n\n*\n\n*What team do I need to talk to about deleting a page on help.ubuntu.com?\n", "Q: Replacement for non-interactive \"chpasswd -e\"? On older Debian machines one could issue something like:\necho '<username>:*'|chpasswd -e\n\nin order to change the password field of the user (<username>) to *.\nNow I am aware of\npasswd -d <username> && passwd -l <username>\n\nto achieve a similar effect and set the password field to !. However, on some newer vanilla Ubuntu configurations (in particular 10.04 LTS) this leads to the user not being able to log into the machine anymore (for example via SSH and key) - with: Your account has expired; please contact your system administrator. - even though passwd(1) \"warns\" that this is possible.\nNow that's exactly what I want to achieve, though. Manually changing the field in the /etc/shadow file from ! to * fixes the issue, but there seems to be no scriptable way to achieve the same without directly fiddling with the shadow file (e.g. with sed). chpasswd -e used to be a convenient alternative, but that has been obviously removed.\nSo what I am looking for is either a variation of passwd -l that lets me choose the token that gets written into the file or any other kind of replacement for the exact functionality that chpasswd -e offered.\nNB: * is already used for system accounts alright, and there seems to be a semantic difference to PAM or whatever between ! and * in the password field.\nAlso note: on Debian 5 and 6 chpasswd -e works. So the functionality must have gotten stripped deliberately in Ubuntu. I tested Ubuntu 9.10, 10.04 (they don't have it), 11.04 and 11.10 have chpasswd -e.\n\nA: Use a simple script like this one I just wrote:\n#!/bin/bash\n\nUSER=$1\nif [[ -z \"$USER\" ]]; then\n  echo \"From which user should I clear the password?\"\n  read USER\nfi\nif chpasswd -e -h > /dev/null 2>&1; then\n  echo \"$USER:*\"|chpasswd -e\nelse\n  passwd -d $USER\n  cp /etc/shadow /etc/shadow.old\n  USEROLD=$USER::\n  USERNEW=$USER:*:\n  sed -i \"s/$USEROLD/$USERNEW/g\" /etc/shadow.old\n  cp /etc/shadow.old /etc/shadow\nfi\n\nThe use of the script is at own risk.\n", "Q: Why do I see multiple processes with the same name Sometimes when I open the System Monitor I see multiple processes with the same name. Some examples are the Plugin-Container,  Gwibber and others. Why do they appear multiple times in System Manager and is there a way to at least visibly unite them together so it shows the same process.\n\nA: I do not know how to unite them. But a common reason that multiple instances of the same process is listed is because multiple processes are active at that moment. For example, Firefox has a Plugin-Container that is a multi-process design. Google Chrome is a multi-process web-browser. So when Chrome is run you will always see multiple instances of Chrome listed.\n", "Q: mp4 video's from web site will not play \nPossible Duplicate:\nHow do I install ubuntu-restricted extras \n\nI can't get video files to play in either Chromium or Firefox, when I try and load them from the web site this is what I get  \"The video could not be loaded, either because the server or network failed or because the format is not supported: http://media.woodsmith.com/etip/2012/02/woodsmithtipsintro_02162012.mp4\"\n\nA: install vlc plugin for mozilla\n sudo apt-get install mozilla-plugin-vlc\n\n", "Q: How to disconnect internet when VPN fails? Normally I'm connected to the Internet with a VPN, but sometimes it fails and some programs may automatically start to use the default unsecure connection.\nHow do I disconnect all the internet until the VPN connection is back up? I want to make sure all the traffic goes exclusively over VPN.\n\nA: Tried unplugging the cable until VPN comes back up?\nIn any case you could delete all the Wired/Wireless connections that Network Manager has stored and just leave the VPN ones there with the \"automatic\" option activated so when VPN comes back up it will connect to it automatically.\n\nJust to make my point a little more clear. In the Wired, Wireless, Mobile Broadband and DSL set any connections you might have there to not automatic (Remove the Connect Automatically check from the checkbox). Or to be more drastic remove the connection completely. The only one that should be in Connect Automatically is the VPN connection you have.\nWith this you should have a system that automatically connects to the VPN when it is available. When it disconnects the system will stay offline until the VPN comes back.\n\nA: If you know the IP address of your VPN, after you connect to a network, you can create a route to that VPN server IP via the default gateways IP and remove the default route to prevent connections anywhere else.\nexport vpn_ip=VPN_SERVER_IP\nexport gateway_ip=$(ip route | grep default | cut -d\" \" -f 3)\n\nsudo ip route del default via $gateway_ip\nsudo ip route add $vpn_ip via $gateway_ip\n\nThis would prevent any connections, regardless of VPN connectivity, to the VPN IP, but still allow the VPN connection to establish/re-establish.\n\nThe problem with other solutions suggested is that you need a connection to connect to a VPN, so, you must connect to LAN/WiFi, you can't just delete/disable those connections.\n", "Q: Linphone - Only default sound device available?

Ekiga has options for all the things you want , where you can decide what outputs the ring, the sound, etc.\n", "Q: Speeding up a Mono compilation / installation Can you configure and make a Mono installation on one server, then copy the files over to another server and simply run \"make install\" to install on the other server? Or do you absolutely have to rebuild the source on every machine?\nIf it's possible, what directories do I need to copy over?\n\nA: It depends. If the servers are identical (same distro and same version of that distro) you can copy files. If the servers aren't identical, it depends (copying between distros is likely to fail, between versions of the same distro may or may not work).\nThe easiest way to do it is to copy the entire repository (after running configure && make), and then just run make install on the target system, just like you suggested.\nUsually mono installs into /usr/local by default (it depends a bit on the system), and if you don't have anything else there, you should also be able to just copy that directory to the target system (if you do have something there, you can create a file list before and after running make install do have a list of files you need to copy).\n", "Q: If a key press doesn't trigger anything in xev, is it still possible to use it for a key binding? I'd like to register keypresses that aren't visible on xev. These are basically \"special\" keys on my keyboard. If the event does show up on xev, is it possible to get at?\n\nA: Sure.  X windows has to send the key press to xev but for various reasons X might send it to something else first, so xev won't show the key press and release events.\nConsider the brightness or multimedia keys.  The key presses aren't shown in xev, but if your X windows environment is set up correctly, you can adjust brightness and so forth.\n", "Q: How to speed up compilation of Ubuntu apps (make, cmake, gcc) I am compiling some programs here and I have 4 cores. Is there a way to tell make, cmake or gcc to compile using all cores or something to that affect?\n\nA: If a package supports it you can use the -j flag to allow parallel jobs running, e.g.:\nmake -j8\n\nMore details on this flag can be found in the Stackoverflow question Why does make -j perform better when it is passed a number larger than the number of cores available?.\nDistributed compilation\nIf you have multiple machines, give distcc a go. On the involved machines, sudo apt-get install distcc. Assuming that your build machine is 192.168.1.1:\n\n\n*\n\n*on the helper machines, run:\nsudo distccd --log-file=/tmp/distccd.log --daemon -a 192.168.1.1\n\n\n*On the build machine, before running configure or cmake you have to specify hosts that you want to use for the build process. Optionally, specify the number of simultaneous jobs after a slash (defaulting to 4):\nexport DISTCC_HOSTS='localhost/4 192.168.1.2/8 192.168.1.3/8'\n\nMake the compiler use distcc:\nexport PATH=\"/usr/lib/distcc:$PATH\"\n\nNow configure or cmake the application and build with:\nmake -j$(distcc -j)\n\nNote that if you've put /usr/lib/distcc twice in your PATH, it'll fail. Be sure to set /usr/lib/distcc only once in your PATH.\nFor more details, see the manual pages for distcc(1) and distccd(1).\n", "Q: How would you configure byobu as a login shell? I need to have my telnet and ssh users use Byobu as their login shell.\nI would like to avoid using .login/.profile/.bashrc and the likes to spawn Byobu.\nI'd like to have Byobu as the shell defined in /etc/passwd.\nI've already done a few tests, but have been unable to have it working properly.\nAny idea?\n\nA: This does not answer the details of the question, but the title of it. So, if your problem is that byobu does not source /etc/profile when starting, it can be fixed as follows. In ~/.byobu/.tmux.conf add:\nset -g default-command '/bin/bash --login'\n\nThis will use bash as login shell, so when starting byobu /etc/profile, will be sourced.\n\nA: add this to /etc/profile\necho $- | grep -qs i && byobu-launcher && exit 0\n\n\nA: Byobu is not a shell, per se.  It's a program you run within your shell.  The utilities, byobu-enable and byobu-disable, put a line at the end of your ~/.profile that launches byobu (if necessary) when you spawn a new login.  The wrapper script there does some sanity checking for you and prevents recursion.\nNow, that said, I'll tell you how you could do what you're asking to do, but I strongly advise against it.  You may well end up in some nasty recursion or infinite loop.  Beware!\n\n\n*\n\n*Set /usr/bin/screen as your login shell in the last field in\n/etc/passwd.\n\n*Put this in your ~/.screenrc:\nsource /usr/share/byobu/profiles/byoburc\n\nA: Before setting the shell, you should probably make sure whatever program you want will work as a shell. \"Valid\" shells are pre-configured in /etc/shells; if what you want to use as a shell isn't in that list, I would consider carefully whether you want to use it as a shell or not. You could try it with a test user first, to make sure you can login okay using it as a shell.\nBut on to how to change your default shell.\nFor individual users, you can change their login shell using the chsh command.\n\nchsh will accept the full pathname of any executable file on the\n  system.

My question is to know if wubi will continue to be a safe and dependable way of installing and using Ubuntu, long-term.\n\nA: Wubi (Windows Based Ubuntu Installer) is just an alternative to users that want to install Ubuntu from Windows. It is one method of installing Ubuntu, there others being Ubuntu from a LiveCD, LiveUSB, Via Network, Via cloning and any other way of installing Ubuntu.\nWubi is not a standard but a way of installing Ubuntu. And from my experience is the last one I would recommend since installing any distro inside the windows partition limits a lot of stuff and from time to time Wubi has been known to create installing/booting problems for Ubuntu in comparison to the LiveCD/LiveUSB ways of installing it which are more safe and less prone to problems.\nIn the long run you will still be able to use Wubi to install Ubuntu.\n", "Q: Do I need same monitor sizes and resolutions for multi monitor support I am testing 12.04 because it has better multi monitor support but I was wondering do I need to have the same size/resolution for it to work correctly.\nFor example the first monitor is a 32' TV with 1920x1080 resolution.

If it's the C:\\ 'drive' you'll have to reboot to let it complete.\n\n*Try booting again. If it hangs, then safely reboot, and retry editing the first grub menu entry pressing E, remove the text quiet splash, hit CtrlX to boot, and then see where it is hanging.\n\n*You may have to boot a live CD and fsck the virtual disk \\ubuntu\\disks\\root.disk, but first see whether you can find out some more details about the problem.\n\n\nIf you find any information that you think will help, please update your question with the details, and I'll update this answer if there is anything to add.

I recently moved to Ubuntu from Windows using the Wubi installer. The issue is that I have a private folder on my Windows NTFS partition. It is configured so that no listing permissions are given to any other user but mine. The folder is password protected in Windows with FolderGuard. The deal is that this folder is perfectly acessible using my ubuntu installation which makes me concerned. So the question is:\n\nIs there any way to password protect a folder inside a NTFS partition\n  in Ubuntu?\n\nUbuntu Virtual disks are on the same partition where the private folder is located.\n\nA: You have to use encryption. Password protecting a folder, as you have discovered, it useless. Take a look at TrueCrypt - a cross-platform encryption tool.\n", "Q: Why is my new user being asked for a sudo password? I'm running Ubuntu 11.10. I'm trying to setup a user that's essentially a clone of the permissions of the ubuntu user. This works but I'm not able to sudo with this new user without supplying a password (which I don't even have for this user). How can I set it up to work the same way as the ubuntu user?\nHere's what I did (I'm doing this over SSH by the way):\nI created a new user with:\nsudo useradd -d /home/ryan -m ryan\n\nThen I added this user to the admin group with:\nsudo usermod -a -G admin ryan\n\nThen I cloned the ssh keys that are setup for the ubuntu user over to this new user:\nsudo mkdir /home/ryan/.ssh\nsudo chown ryan:ryan /home/ryan/.ssh\nsudo cp /home/ubuntu/.ssh/authorized_keys /home/ryan/.ssh\nsudo chown ryan:ryan /home/ryan/.ssh/authorized_keys\n\nI then was able to ssh to the machine as ryan using the key to authenticate me. But when I try to do a sudo commend I get prompted for a password:\nryan@machine:~$ sudo /etc/passwd\n[sudo] password for ryan: \n\nHow can I bypass this? Basically I want it to work like the ubuntu user...\n\nA: The \"ubuntu\" user on a live CD is configured with a blank (empty) password.

I am behind a network firewall that doesn't let me ssh through the default port. Because of that, I can't push any bzr branches to my repository. I would like to know if it is possible to somehow proxy the ssh through port 80 so I can push the branches.\nI heard that corkscrew lets you do that but I am not sure how to do that exactly. \nIf you know any working proxy server that lets you do that, please do mention them.\n\nA: I've just read a sophisticated solution here:\nhttp://benctechnicalblog.blogspot.hu/2011/03/ssh-over-connect-over-port-80.html\nYou can SSH home on port 80 even if your home server runs a webserver on port 80 too.\nAssuming the home server runs Apache. The idea involves enabling mod_proxy in your server, then restricting it into connecting to localhost (proxy.conf):\n<IfModule mod_proxy.c>\n         ProxyRequests On\n        <Proxy *>\n                AddDefaultCharset off\n                Order deny,allow\n                Deny from all\n        </Proxy>\n        <Proxy localhost>\n          Allow from all\n        </Proxy>\n        AllowCONNECT 22\n        ProxyVia On\n</IfModule>\n\nNow you can do a HTTP connect request to the localhost and the webserver will establish a tunnel for you, you only need to make sure all traffic goes through your proxy:\nssh -o 'ProxyCommand nc -X connect -x myhost.example.com:80 localhost 22' myhost.example.com\n\nMake sure localhost connections to SSH is not privileged (to avoid letting strangers in...)\nThis should work if you are behind a router that allows only port 80 out.\nIf you are behind a proxy (so you need to set proxy in your browser to get web), you will need to first establish a tunnel to your own host, then issuing another CONNECT request inside this tunnel to get to your host. This is more sophisticated, you will need to use 2 netcats for this.\nEverything is possible, but do it for your own risk...\nUPDATE:\nOr simply, just use a web application that gives you SSH via a browser. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web-based_SSH\n\nA: A good corporate firewall will inspect traffic regardless of port so changing port just might not work.\nIf you have control over the server, and still want to try it, you can change the sshd port to port 80. Warning If you have something else running on port 80 (on the server) this will not work and will likely mean you completely lose SSH access to the server!\nYou'll need to edit /etc/ssh/sshd_config and change Port to 80. Then run \nsudo restart ssh\n\nAnd then connect:\nssh user@host -p80\n\nYour bzr path would then look something like: bzr+ssh://host:80/path/\n\nAnother method is to use WebDav. This should skirt around the firewall problem completely because it all happens on Port 80 but it will require you to be running Apache and set up a number of things:\n\n\n*\n\n*Get WebDav installed\n\n*Move your branch into the right place\n\n*Use the bzr-webdav plugin to connect\n\n\n\nA VPN might be an option but if ssh is locked out, I'd expect that to be excluded too.\nYou might just want to have a word with your network admins. You need to do something and they're stopping you. If they've got a reason for blocking ssh, it's likely they'll view any extreme attempts to circumvent it fairly negatively... \nIn short, it might just be safer to talk to them.\n\nA: If you don't have any control over the server to change the SSH port to port 80, or if you can't SSH over port 80 because the firewall blocks you from transferring such data through port 80, you can try TOR.\nTOR is a huge network. Your computer connects to another computer somewhere in the world, that computer connects to another one until it reaches the SSH server. This is all firewall-friendly, happens on port 443 (which your company doesn't block, or else.. well, that's not so smart of them). It's designed for this kind of traffic re-routing, and it's encrypted too. This way, you can access any host on any port (also a server's SSH on port 22).\nTake a look at it online at https://www.torproject.org.\n\nA: I am sorry, I have to play devils advocate.  \nI know that there is most likely a reason for doing this, however, why won't your networking/firewall admin's open the specific port you are looking for?  From a security standpoint, do you want to take the chance that web-inspect will miss anything?  If it's configured to by-pass port 80 for std traffic, and you are putting yourself in harms way.\nI agree with a few suggestions above, where as a point to point vpn may be a more secure option.  Again, from a security standpoint, I would be interested to know the reason you are truly bypassing security policies and why you cannot either put your server in a dmz or backbone for access.  Just me.  Good luck.\n\nA: SSH through the proxy\nIf the firewall lets you, you can run ssh to any port, but that requires the ssh server to be listening on that port. Port 80 is unlikely to work, because most places that have firewalls analyse the traffic on that port and block anything that isn't HTTP. But port 443, which is normally the HTTPS port, often works, because SSH and HTTPS look a lot like each other to filtering software, so your SSH session will look like an HTTPS session. (It is possible to distinguish HTTPS and SSH, so this won't work if the firewall is sophisticated enough.)\nIf you have control over the server, make it listen on port 443 in addition to 22 (the normal ssh port). You can configure the port in /etc/ssh/sshd_config: add a line\nPort 443\n\nin addition to the Port 22 that should already be there. Note that this assumes that the ssh server is not also an HTTPS server. If it is, you'll need to find another port that the firewall lets you use or to find another ssh server (see forwarding below).\nIf you don't need to set a web proxy in your web browser, then you can try connecting directly:\nssh -p 443 myserver.example.com\n\nIf that works, define an alias in your ~/.ssh/config:\nHost myserver\nHostName myserver.example.com\nPort 443\n\nIf you need to set a web proxy in your web browser, tell ssh to go through the proxy. Install corkscrew. Define an alias like this in your ~/.ssh/config, where http://proxy.acme.com:3128/ is the proxy you use for HTTPS to outside (replace by the proper host name and port):\nHost myserver\nHostName myserver.example.com\nPort 443\nProxyCommand /usr/bin/corkscrew proxy.acme.com 3128 %h %p\n\nSSH over SSH\nIf you can get to some outside machine by one of the techniques above but not to the machine you're interested in, use that to forward a connection. Assuming you can ssh to a machine called mygateway and you want to reach the SSH server on mytarget, install netcat-openbsd on mygateway (or, if it's not running Ubuntu, make sure it has the nc command). Put this in your ~/.ssh/config:\nHost mytarget\nProxyCommand ssh mygateway nc %h %p\n\nSSH to Apache\nIf the host you want to connect to is already running Apache and listening on port 443, and you have control over that host, you can set up this Apache to accept SSH connections and forward them. See Tunneling SSH over HTTP(S).\n", "Q: How can I remove gpg key that I added using apt-key add -? I don't need the key in my server's keyring anymore. Is it possible to remove it?

If you want to run an application as part of the user session, there are better tools.\nVia the GUI\nYou can configure a startup application in a user's session by picking Startup Applications... from the cog menu in the top right of the screen, and then pick Add and fill in the details for gedit.\nWhen you log in next time, the application should start with the session.\nManually\nIf you can't use the UI to configure this, it is possible to configure it by dropping a .desktop file in one of the autostart directories according to the Autostart specification:\nhttp://standards.freedesktop.org/autostart-spec/autostart-spec-latest.html\nIf you want it to affect every user on the system, place the file in /etc/xdg/autostart.

This is part of a security measure to stop programs unintentionally writing working .desktop files due to bugs.\n\nA: I've found a workaround.  If anyone else know 'the right way', please let me know.\nThe upstart script needs to write a flag file. Another process that is started by the user will be constantly looking for this flag file to be created. The upstart script can leave any relevant information in the flag file.  A regular user of course or root has not problem running gui apps.

I realized after installing that it would boot straight into Windows, so I looked up the issue. I read something about UEFI, and found a page suggesting that I wipe the drive with GParted, installing a msdos partition table, and then install Ubuntu. (I tried linux mint first, because that's what I had on my flash drive at the moment.) I attempted this, and now I'm left with a computer that won't boot anything from the hard drive. If I install Ubuntu or Linux Mint 12 using either MSDOS or GPT, it simply skips the hard drive. My BIOS has no option to disable EFI, and I'll admit I know shamefully little about EFI or different types of partition tables. I'd like to know what I have to do to make my computer boot again.\n\nA: I'm using a Lenovo V570 also, and Ubuntu 11.10 (the 12.04 alpha also) and LinuxMint 12 (All 64bit) both set up EFI partitions for themselves automatically (In a 20mb FAT partition). Currently my hard drive (which is the one that came with the laptop is set up as follows - 20MB FAT (EFI system partition) - 30GB EXT4 (Root Partition) - 604GB EXT4 (Home Partition) - 6.4GB Swap Space (which is probably really excessive). All of this is under a GUID partition table, which wikipedia just told me is part of the EFI standard. My guess would be to boot into the live environment and with the disk utility change the partition table from msdos to GUID. I'm by no means an absolute authority in this matter but I hope this helps.\n\nA: I'm answering my own question:\nIt turns out I didn't have UEFI after all, but for some reason my Lenovo was incapable of booting with GRUB. I couldn't figure this out myself, but I found a workaround. I installed windows 7, and used the Wubi installer to install Ubuntu 11.10, then set up the partitions I had set aside already in fstab. It's not exactly what I wanted, but the result is exactly the same. I also get the added bonus of editing the Windows bootloader via EasyBCD, instead of having to mess with grub. For simplicity and stability, this approach could be recommended to anybody who doesn't feel like or can't manually mess around with their system's boot loader.\n\nA: I have a Lenovo V570. Installing Mint 12 or Debian 6 worked fine. Installing Ubuntu 11.10 or 12.04 Beta 2 seemed to work fine -- the graphical installer worked fine -- but upon reboot, the OS would not come up.\nGoogling around got me to this solution :\nBoot liveCD. Run graphical installer. Then before rebooting, fire up a terminal.\nsudo apt-get install efibootmgr\nsudo modprobe efivars\nsudo efibootmgr\n\nThe first line installs efibootmgr, the second line adds efi support to the kernel running in the livecd environment, third line shows all the options for booting in your machine's bios/efi boot screen. When I did this, I saw that Ubuntu was listed, as option 9, and option 9 was not part of the options marked as bootable.\nSo to change the boot order I first researched using man efibootmgr and found :\nCHANGING THE BOOT ORDER FOR THE NEXT BOOT ONLY\nAssuming  the  configuration  in  Example  #1, efibootmgr -n 4 could be called to specify that the Linux entry be taken on next boot.\nCHANGING THE BOOT ORDER\nAssuming the configuration in Example #1, efibootmgr -o  3,4  could  be called to specify PXE boot first, then Linux boot.\nSo in my case, with Ubuntu listed as option 9, I did :\nsudo efibootmgr -o 9,andthensomeotheroptionslikemycddrive\n\nI then rebooted, removed the livecd when prompted, and was greeted by a working Ubuntu installation.\nWhat I suspect happened : Linux Mint 12 and Debian 6 installers both looked at the machine's EFI/GPT partition table and said, \"Meh. Whatever.\" and just reformatted it to an msdos/mbr partition table, installed their system, and threw grub2 on the mbr. Old school style, but it works a treat. Ubuntu 11.10 and 12.04 Beta 2 installers looked at the machine, tried to set up for EFI/GPT booting, and successfully did so, except for reordering the BIOS/EFI boot order and putting Ubuntu first. Instead, the installers just left the BIOS/EFI boot order alone, and so Ubuntu as a boot option just, well, wasn't--as far as the machine was concerned.\n", "Q: Change window move funcitonality to mirror OSX's Zooom2 On OSX I use Zooom2 to move my windows around with keyboard shortcuts and mouse motion.

The ia32-libs package is no longer present in Ubuntu 12.04 repositories for a 64bit system.\nAre there any available replacement packages available for download?\n\nA: I read that you are supposed to install the ia32-libs-multiarch package instead.\nHowever it didn't work for me and I get this error \nia32-libs-multiarch:i386 : Depends: libgphoto2-2:i386 but it is not going to be installed.\n\nThe solution which worked for me was to install the following packages:\nsudo apt-get install libc6:i386 libgcc1:i386 gcc-4.6-base:i386 libstdc++5:i386 libstdc++6:i386\n\n\nA: Ubuntu 13.10\nWhat happened?\nThe ia32-libs package has been completely replaced by lib32z1 lib32ncurses5 lib32bz2-1.0. This should not be a problem because its functionality is still there, just in other packages. However, we do not live in an ideal world where everyone maintains their packages and all software is FLOSS, so some packages still depend on the ia32-libs.\nHow can I install package x that depends on ia32-libs\nThere are 2 ways:\n\n*\n\n*You can repackage it manually so it does not depend on the ia32-libs anymore. (preferred)\n\n*You can install ia32-libs from the Ubuntu 13.04 (Raring Ringtail) repository (not preferred at all!, only if first method does not work)\n\n1. Repackage old packages\nI will use the citrix receiver as an example, but you can use this method for any .deb package:\nFirst, download the citrix receiver .deb package from their website and make a temporary directory do do the hacking in.\nmkdir ica_temp\n\nExtract the package\ndpkg-deb -x icaclient_13.0.0.256735_amd64.deb ica_temp\ndpkg-deb --control icaclient_13.0.0.256735_amd64.deb ica_temp/DEBIAN\n\nOpen the file in gedit (or your favorite editor)\nsudo -H gedit ica_temp/DEBIAN/control\n\nFind the line that starts with Depends:.... remove ia32-libs and add lib32z1 lib32ncurses5 lib32bz2-1.0\nRebuild the modified package\ndpkg -b ica_temp icaclient-modified.deb\n\nAnd install it\nsudo dpkg -i icaclient-modified.deb\nsudo apt-get install -f\n\nInstalling the citrix receiver requires some hacking too. You can find the full installation instructions on the Ubuntu wiki\nYou can do this with any old .deb package that still depends on ia32-libs.\n2. Install ia32-libs from raring repository\nPlease note that is it very bad practice to install old packages! Sadly, for some binary installers, you do not have any other choice.\nYou can download the ia32-libs package from the raring repository.\nDownload it and install it manually, then the dependencies should be resolved.\n\nA: If you get that error, try:\nsudo apt-get update\n\nThen try it again:\nsudo apt-get install ia32-libs\n\nI just did a fresh install of 12.04, that package is still available in the repositories.\nIn fact, I got that error myself before I ran update. Afterwards, it worked fine. \n\nA: The ia32-libs package was a hack to get 32-bit packages installed on a 64-bit installation. Since Ubuntu version 11.10 (Oneiric), Multi Arch has been added. One of the objectives for it is removing the ia32-libs package. Instead, you have to install the 32-bit libraries of a package with:\nsudo apt-get install package-name:i386\n\nYou don't have to worry about this for packages in the standard repositories (e.g. the wine package). For external software, it's a bit more difficult because you have to find the dependencies manually. In that case, use your favorite search engine to find which libraries you need.\nIt seems that ia32-libs still exist, but merely as a convenience package to include common 32-bit libraries. This package now uses Multi Arch to install the 32-bit packages correctly.\n\nA: I believe this specific use case was replaced with the packages \"lib32z1 lib32ncurses5 lib32bz2-1.0 lib32asound2\", which is probably a more specific and useful answer than saying \"you can use multi-arch\".\n\nA: I installed the ia32-libs like this (I run Ubuntu 13.04 Raring Ringtail on a 64 bit machine):\nCheck own architecture:\n$ dpkg --print-architecture\n\nCheck if a foreign architecture is installed:\n$ dpkg --print-foreign-architectures\n\nDepending on the results of the two commands above, the following three commands might work (took a long time to process in my case):\n$ sudo dpkg --add-architecture i386 && sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install ia32-libs\n\n", "Q: How to restore data from a damaged partition I unknowingly tried to change my 480 GB NTFS partition to ext4 from GParted.

So far so good.\nWhat doesn't work\nFor the problem to present itself, two factors must be present.\n\n\n*\n\n*GPU acceleration must be enabled in VLC\n\n*\n\n*And the material to be played must take advantage of it, e.g. H.264 or the like\n\n\n*VLC must be launched from the Dash (the menu you get by pressing the Super-key in Unity)\n\n*\n\n*Whether the program itself is launched from the Dash and the material to be played is chosen from within VLC, or the material is picked directly from within the Dash doesn't matter\n\n*Launching from the Unity Launcher has the same effect\n\n\n\nIf the above is true, VLC crashes 100% of the time, while if it is launched in any other way (e.g. from terminal with vlc or from Nautilus with 'Open with VLC Media Player') it never crashes.\nWhat I have tried\n\n\n*\n\n*I have installed VLC 2.0.1 from ppa:videolan/stable-daily.

I've run into an annoyance on Lubuntu 11.10, described here:\nhttp://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=1869357\nI came up with a workaround, described here:\nhttp://ubuntuforums.org/showpost.php?p=11714061&postcount=30\nMy workaround involves putting a script in /etc/pm/sleep.d to run on resume.\nHowever, the workaround only seems to work when I suspend using pm-suspend. When I suspend by closing my laptop's lid, my workaround fails. How can I get a script to run when I resume from sleep, and that sleep was triggered by closing the lid?\nDetails:\nI suspect this failure might be because scripts in /etc/pm/sleep.d are not getting executed when I suspend by closing the lid. Suspending with pm-suspend, then resuming by closing/opening the lid works fine. I believe Lubuntu uses xfce4-power-manager to handle suspension due to lid closing, perhaps this is important? I prefer to suspend by closing my laptop's lid, rather than typing a terminal command.\nEDIT:\nBy inspecting /var/log/pm-suspend.log as suggested by andrewsomething, we can see that the reset_panel script runs on every resume, it just fails on resumes that follow lid-triggered suspends. I followed his further suggestion that I add an export statement to my script, and things are working now. The script triggers too early in the wakeup process, but that's not hard to fix. The current version of the script:\n#!/bin/bash\ncase \"$1\" in\n   suspend|hibernate)\n      #do nothing\n   ;;\n   resume|thaw)\n      export DISPLAY=:0 #What does this do?

Thanks for the help!\n\nA: The fact that the log contained /etc/pm/sleep.d/reset_panel resume suspend: Cant connect to display: indicates that no display is set, and you are trying to run a graphical program. When you're running pm-suspend from your session, the correct display was set probably by LightDM or whatever your display manager is. When it gets run automatically on resume, I assume it's getting run as the root user and not attached to a display. So you need to set the display variable yourself, like so:\n#!/bin/bash\ncase \"$1\" in\n   suspend|hibernate)\n      #do nothing\n   ;;\n   resume|thaw)\n      export DISPLAY=:0\n      sleep 5 && lxpanelctl restart & #Delayed so the battery icon can finish wrecking shop.\n   ;;\n   *)\n      exit 1\n   ;;\nesac\nexit 0\n\nThe only draw back is that this won't work if you display isn't actually :0 That's the default, but it could change particularly in a multi-user setting.\n", "Q: How do I switch to another audio output sink in XFCE?

I had to type the following before using pavucontrol to use my bt headphone:\npactl load-module module-alsa-sink device=btheadset\n\nYou can control if this was successful by typing:\npactl list short sinks\n\nOutput should look similar to:\n\n0       alsa_output.pci-0000_03_04.0.iec958-stereo      module-alsa-card.c      s16le 2ch 44100Hz       SUSPENDED\n2       alsa_output.btheadset   module-alsa-sink.c      s16le 2ch 44100Hz       IDLE\n\nI also have a short script to move sound from alsa/pulseaudio to bt that I called 'toBt.sh':\n#!/bin/bash\n\nOCHANNEL=`pactl list modules short | grep btheadset | cut -f 1`\nfor i in $OCHANNEL; do\n        echo \"altes module $i\"\n        pactl unload-module $i\ndone\nCHANNEL=`pactl load-module module-alsa-sink device=btheadset`\necho \"neues module $CHANNEL\"\nif [ $? -ne 0 ]; then\n        echo \"No bt connection\"\n        exit -1\nfi\nSINK=`pactl list sinks short | grep btheadset | cut -f 1`\nINPUTS=`pactl list sink-inputs short | cut -f 1`\nfor i in $INPUTS; do\n        echo \"Verschiebe in $i nach $SINK\"\n        pactl move-sink-input $i $SINK\ndone\n\nTo return to alsa/pulseaudio sound I've got 'toAlsa.sh':\n#!/bin/bash\n\nSINK=`pactl list sinks short | grep alsa-card | cut -f 1`\nINPUTS=`pactl list sink-inputs short | cut -f 1`\nfor i in $INPUTS; do\n        echo \"Verschiebe in $i nach $SINK\"\n        pactl move-sink-input $i $SINK\ndone\n\n\nA: Sound Switcher Indicator\nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:yktooo/ppa\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get install indicator-sound-switcher\n\n\nWhile pavucontrol provides more differentiated options (default/fallback device versus per-application device), this tool simply changes all the above to one device, but provides easier access. Its unilateral setting can be refined in pavucontrol if necessary.\n\nA: Testing Xfce panel version 4.12.2: the volume indicator already has that feature. It is a pulseaudio  plugin (xfce4-pulseaudio-plugin) for the Xfce panel.\n\nThe output device is listed under the main scroll given more than one sink is available; on mouse hover a list of available output devices is displayed.\n\nSo, no external application is needed for the purpose discussed here, although pavucontrol may be useful (especially given that Xfce has no specific audio settings like other desktops have).\n\nNon-Xfce-specific tools can be also used like pasystray(PulseAudio System Tray), as explained here, similar to Sound Switcher Indicator, already mentioned under this question; pasystraydoesn't need a new PPA to be added.\n\nA: After installing pavucontrol you have graphical access to several useful settings for pulseaudio including a choice for your output device. Choose the default output device in the Output Device tab:\n\nA currently playing stream of a given application can also be moved to another device in the Playback tab from the dropdown menu next to Playback Stream on:\n\n\nA: I am on Xubuntu and i also faced this problem. I installed pulseaudio's manager and it works fine! \nHTH\n", "Q: Will long-term use of ubuntu via wubi harm my PC? I do see a part of my question being discussed already. The specific answer I'm looking for  is, will LONG-TERM use of Ubuntu via Wubi harm my PC (i.e cause irrevocable h/w failure or damage my windows 7 installation)...? My daily use is a few hrs (say 4-8 hrs/day) on Wubi-Ubuntu. I certainly don't want to shorten my PC's expected life-span by using Wubi. I am so far glad with wubi's performance on my thinkpad T510, so no major complaints on that end. Also re-partitioning my HD is not an option for me since I'm not an \"adept\" in computers and won't wanna affect existing win 7 installation or the manufacturer's recovery partition. Thanks in advance for suggestions!\n\nA: No, using Wubi or extended periods of time will not shorten the life span of your computer at all.\nHowever, there are many advantages to dual booting as opposed to using Wubi. For example:\n\n\n*\n\n*Wubi is slower then a dual booted Ubuntu install, and Wubi installs cannot Hibernate (it can Suspend).\n\n*Wubi installs are also much more likely to break through an update.\n\n*Dual booting the computer does not endanger Windows 7 at all, and the Ubuntu installer makes dual booting very easy.\n\n\nI would highly recommend dual booting if you intend on using Ubuntu for long periods of time.\n\nA: If you currently do not have problems with your Wubi installation I do not see how it could harm your PC.\nThere are a few things to consider though (in theory):\n\n\n*\n\n*If you have heating problems under Ubuntu, that can shorten the lifetime of your hardware components.\n\n*By using NTFS partitions to exchange data between Ubuntu and Windows there is a slight chance to somehow break the integrity of the Windows filesystem. Or if it is your Windows system partition, you could modify it so that it will not boot.\n\n\nIt is always a good idea to have a separate Ubuntu installation, because if the other OS might fail, you can access your data from the working one.\n\nA: From my experience, I can say that Installing Ubuntu with Wubi should be avoided, for sure. Also, Canonical should neither recommend nor support Wubi installations, as it will mar Ubuntu's image in the market. I had installed Ubuntu on my Acer system under Wubi. Whenever I was using Ubuntu, my system used to touch 90 degrees. However, on Win7, its temperature used to stay at around 60 degrees. During the overheats, the system used to promptly shut off. Now this problem has become permanent in my system, and even leads to shutdowns in Windows. This could've been a problem specific to my Acer. But soon, I did the same thing on a one day old Lenovo IdeaPad, and what would you know? It started feeling like a frying pan the moment I installed Ubuntu on Wubi. If you really want to use ubuntu, do so on a separate partition, natively. Avoid Wubi.\n\nA: this is based on my experience. Wubi will be useful if you have a good internet connection since it downloads a selected ubuntu environment during installation. On the other hand, Wubi will be useless if your internet connection is less than 1 Mb/s since the download process would take time\n", "Q: Advice on partitioning 11.10 at Installation time I am new to Ubuntu and just got a new 1TB hdd, please, help me better understand partitioning at install time so to avoid problems in the future. I was planning to use:\nDEVICE     TYPE     LOCATION  FILESYSTEM    SIZE    MOUNT POINT\n/dev/sda1, Primary, Beginning, Ext4,        50GB   /\n/dev/sda5, Logical, Beginning, SWAP,        8GB    not applicable\n/dev/sda6, Logical, Begining,  Ext5,        942GB  /home\n\nI have 4GB RAM and I would like to have my /home into a separate partition to try mitigating problems if the drive fails. Regarding the types, Primary/Logical, does it seem all right? Locations? Mount Points?\nmany thanks for your feedback!\n\nA: This is a good partitioning scheme.  (I use one extra partition to allow me to install different distributions at the same time, but if you don't plan on doing that, it's unnecessary).\nFor posterity - make sure you're /home partition has most of the space like the OP does in most cases.  /home is where your files will end up (including any large media files, which often is what takes up most space).  The exception to this is if you will never be using many large files, but do plan installing very many very large programs.  \n\nA: The main implication of Primary vs Logical partitions is that you can have a maximum of four primary partitions on a disk drive with mbr partitioning. So, if all you want is one Linux instalation, you can easily have primary root, swap, and home partitions. In fact, you could still use the fourth one for logical partitions for other system installations.\n\nA: From my experience the only one that lowers itself is SWAP depending on the amount of RAM you have. For a normal computer usage (Office stuff, gimp, music, videos, wine games..) with 4GB of RAM you have more than enough and you can put SWAP to a small size. In my case 256MB. From the 256MB i never use more than 2MB or 4MB.\nThat is an idea of how the SWAP would be depending on the amount of memory you have. The rule of 2x the amount of ram you have does not really apply on Linux systems. There are so optimized about this is scares me.\nGoing for the other 2, you have the / (root) partition and the /home (Home) partition. This is good way to go but I would suggest giving /Home about 90% of the 1TB space and the rest to /. This is because you will install many programs which will go in / but you will have songs, documents, videos and any other big files in /home. You will basically have more stuff in /home than anywhere else.\nThere is also the matter of having a /boot partition separated from the / one. This just helps in recovering issues and reparing boot part easier without affecting the system or you /home. Although in your case, since /home is separated from / you are safe there.\nSo basically:\nWay 1\nSWAP\n/  \n\n\n*\n\n*In Way 1 if you had a system problem or a boot problem everything will have the problem. You can recover from it but it will be a mess with everything in the same partition.\n\n\nWay 2\nSWAP\n/\n/Home    \n\n\n*\n\n*In Way 2 you have the /Home in another place so if there is a problem with the system or boot you are safe. \n\n\nWay 3\nSWAP\n/\n/Home\n/Boot  \n\n\n*\n\n*In Way 3 you have the /Home and /Boot in separate places. So if there is a /Boot problem then it only affects boots. If there is a system problem it only affects the system and you can still boot... weirdly but you can still do it. And as always, your /home is safe.\n\n\nThere are many others like creating a /media/fun partition where you will store your videos, images, etc.. Or a /home/kathy for that special girlfriend/sister/mother/godzilla you have.\nAt the end, the way you partition is determined by the need and the way you will use the computer.\n", "Q: How do I use git with google code on ubuntu? I'm a beginner with git and google code, and I'm not sure how to set it up so that I can put my source on google code. I read some tutorials but I still don't understand.\n\nA: https://code.google.com/hosting/settings\nClick on the above link and copy and paste the line they suggest for you into a new file called .netrc. Then where it says code.google.com change it to project.googlecode.com where for example my project is called rentap so I put rentap.googlecode.com in place of code.google.com.\nThen open a terminal and type \ngit remote add googlecode https://rentap.googlecode.com/git\nexcept replace rentap with the name of your project instead of mine. \nI personally don't know much about it, but what works for me is to use gitg that I installed from Ubuntu Software Center (which will also install git for you) and open the folder my project is in on my computer, click the 2nd tab and double click everything on the left, type in a summary of the changes, and click commit.\nThen I open a terminal and type \ngit push googlecode\nIt works. When I click on the source tab of my project on code.google.com, everythings there.\nAs for the wiki, I don't bother with that on my computer. I just update it in my project on code.google.com.\n\nA: If you have git installed, from the command line you can use git clone https://code.google.com/p/your-project-name to copy down the files.  This will create a directory with your project name in the directory you are currently in.\nYou can also use git commit to commit changes, and git push to push changes up to the server.  use git alone for a list of all available options.\nIn ubuntu there is also a git GUI that you can get from the app manager.  search for git and you should find it.  it is identical to the git GUI on windows.\n", "Q: Custom LiveCD without Unity still tries to load ubuntu session.

First because of the hardware support. Older versions have less hardware support and even less for newer existing hardware. Second is the security for it. Third the performance, stability and you can see where I am going with this.\nJump all that you will be happy to know that 12.04 will have Gnome Classic. You will be able to install it from one single package. It will look like the older version but enhanced with all the new updates for each app that Gnome Classic uses.\nJust to add that the latest will receive more up to date stuff than an older version. This includes the kernel because 10.10 I think uses the 2.6.35 Kernel and ends on April 2012. The same date that 12.04 comes out with the 3.2 Kernel (Awesome version) and better support for Gnome Classic. Besides compiling the 3.x kernel to an older Ubuntu version includes having to start a domino effect of compilations between all apps to get them all working correctly at the end.\nSo for my suggestion. Stay with the one you are using until 12.04 comes out. Then install 12.04 and apply the Gnome Classic package. Logout, select Gnome Classic. Enjoy. You would get an updated Ubuntu with the Gnome Classic.\nHere is some info about it:  \nhttp://www.webupd8.org/2012/02/more-classic-gnome-session-lands-in.html\nhttp://jeremy.bicha.net/2012/02/11/ubuntu-classic-now-with-indicators/\n\n", "Q: Tomcat Manager Application and HTTP 404 Error I am trying to set up the admin application for a Tomcat 6.0.24 instance.

Investigating this showed that the role of manager was not present there for the user admin; I fixed that by doing:\nINSERT USER_ROLE_DB SET USER_NAME='admin', ROLE_NAME='manager';\n\nI restarted Tomcat, although I suspect that was overkill. No change. I don't see any errors in catalina.out or in localhost.* log files.\nWhat am I missing? What is the interaction between the different realms?

The first version that has it is the 6.0.30 version (at least according to the changelog).\nAs a result, Tomcat Manager was incompatible with version of Tomcat that I used.

If you are checking the screen session has been created (with ps) be aware that they are sometimes in capitals (e.g. ps | grep SCREEN)\nNow nmcli and similar will fail.\nIn particular, I noted that my problem was that nmcli dev wifi would execute just fine, but nmcli nm wifi on wouldn't.\nThe solution for me was quite simple in the end.

How to check what bootloader my System is using?\nSuch as Lilo or Grub or Grub2. How can I check it?\n\nA: Assuming your boot disk is /dev/sda (it usually is), you can look at your boot sector to see what your computer starts with:\nsudo file -s /dev/sda\n\nThis shows some information about what's at the beginning of /dev/sda (your hard disk — often the boot disk if you have several). For example, mine begins with\n/dev/sda: x86 boot sector; GRand Unified Bootloader, stage1 version 0x3, …\n\nshowing that I have Grub 2 (which is the default bootloader on Ubuntu these days).\nAnother place to look is what scripts run when you install the kernel. One or more of these scripts should register the newly installed kernel with the bootloader. These scripts live in /etc/kernel/postinst.d.\nUsually, the two methods will give the same result. They won't if you have multiple operating systems and Ubuntu's bootloader is not the one that loads first, but rather is invoked by some other operating system's bootloader.\n\nA: Download bootscript and install http://bootinfoscript.sourceforge.net/\nThis boot_info_script is a bash script which searches all hard drives attached to the computer for information related to booting.

My wife is totally blind and has trouble using the mouse to find icons.\nSwitched back to 11.04 with classic Gnome desktop for which Orca works fine. She just has to right-click with the mouse and Orca works great after that, but this doesn't work with 11.10. Is it going to work in 12.04 when it comes out. I would like to upgrade but can't unless we can get a screen reader that will work right.\n\nA: Orca is supported, the accessibility team does try to make application authors aware of its existence and stop them breaking their applications when used with Orca. Right now there are some elements of the desktop that are not readable, I think because of some toolkit changes. Things are generally improving now, but the whole Unity/NUX thing was a setback for some time, as was the increased use of the Qt toolkit before it had accessibility bindings. We will publish release notes for 12.04 and commentaries of using the desktop with orca on http://ubuntuaccessibility.wordpress.com and that is where you can find some release notes on it for 11.10.

There is no way to suggest that it takes any (*) pictures from the selected folder, so the exact command must be specified each time, as in the example below:\ngconftool-2 --set /apps/gnome-terminal/profiles/Default/background_image --type=string /home/mike/Pictures/Canon/2012_09_05/IMG_1130.jpg\n\nHowever, you can hack together a basic terminal wallpaper changer script like I show below. In this script I declare the variables and then call them and simply use sleep to give a delay between the changes. It works, but you can expand it to include more variables and more sleep commands to last several hours or more. \nIt changes the background whether the terminal is running or not, as it is the equivalent of using the gconftool-2 command above on the command-line. However, in your profile you must have selected 'image' and not 'solid' background in edit > profile preferences > background image, or by running the below command:\ngconftool-2 --set /apps/gnome-terminal/profiles/Default/background_type --type=string image\n\nThe default terminal profile is selected in the command, so make sure that is the one you are using or change it as you wish.\nOne thing to watch out for is very high resolution pictures, as gnome-terminal tends to guzzle a lot of memory if you use 2-3mb images for your wallpaper, so its best to use 200-300kb images.\nSave the script in a text-editor, make it executable with chmod u+x and then you can click to execute it.\n#!/bin/bash\n\n# a very simple script to act as an automatic background-switcher for gnome-terminal\n\npic1=\"gconftool-2 --set /apps/gnome-terminal/profiles/Default/background_image --type=string /home/mike/Pictures/Canon/2012_09_05/IMG_1130.jpg\"\npic2=\"gconftool-2 --set /apps/gnome-terminal/profiles/Default/background_image --type=string /home/mike/Pictures/Canon/2012_09_05/IMG_1155.jpg\"\npic3=\"gconftool-2 --set /apps/gnome-terminal/profiles/Default/background_image --type=string /home/mike/Pictures/Canon/2012_09_05/IMG_1163.jpg\"\npic4=\"gconftool-2 --set /apps/gnome-terminal/profiles/Default/background_image --type=string /home/mike/Pictures/Canon/2012_09_05/IMG_1164.jpg\"\n\n$pic1\nsleep 600\n$pic2\nsleep 600\n$pic3\nsleep 600\n$pic4\nexit \n\nOther alternatives\nIt is a very simple script and will obviously need to be restarted when the number of pictures to change runs out, so it might be better to use one of the gconftool-2 commands in cron to specify that, for example, every hour the background should be changed to a specific picture. \n", "Q: How do i share files between my ubuntu host and xp pro virtual machine? \nPossible Duplicate:\nShared folders in XP virtualbox guest \n\n\nI'm using Virtualbox 4.1.8 to run Windows XP PRO.

As part of the Ubuntu Accomplishments system I have a daemon that runs as well as a client that connects to it. The daemon is written in Python (using Twisted) and provides a dbus service and a means of processing requests from the clients.\nRight now the daemon is just a program I run before I run the client and it sets up the dbus service and provides an API that can be used by the clients.\nI want to transform this into something that can be installed and run as a system service for the user's session (e.g. starting on boot) and providing a means to start and stop it etc.\nThe problem is, I am not sure what I need to do to properly daemonify it so it can run as this service. I wanted to ask if others can provide some guidance. Some things I need to ask:\n\n\n*\n\n*How can I treat it as a service that is run for the current user service (not a system service right now)?\n\n*How do I ensure I can start, stop, and restart this session service?\n\n*When packaging this, how do I ensure that it installs it as a service for the user's session and is started on login etc?\n\n\nIn responding, if you can point me to specific examples or solutions I need to implement, that would be helpful. :-)\nThanks!\n\nA: I found several how-to's just by running a Google search:\nhttp://www.enderunix.org/docs/eng/daemon.php\nhttp://www.netzmafia.de/skripten/unix/linux-daemon-howto.html\nhttp://code.activestate.com/recipes/66012-fork-a-daemon-process-on-unix/\nhttp://cjh.polyplex.org/software/daemon.pdf\nI hope they can help you on your way.\n\nA: A daemon is basically a program with no direct user interaction... So there is nothing really specific about it. Nevertheless, you have to take care about some keys points :\n\n\n*\n\n*any output or log should go to syslog, not the standard output\n\n*at startup, create a pid file under /var/run. And clear it at shutdown.\n\n*you have to write a service supervision file, to be located in /etc/init.d (scripts for existing daemon are a good source of inspiration). This script usually has to start the daemon under the right user, provide it with the right configuration files and so on.\n\n*your process might begin with a fork, to detach from the calling process, but I'm not really sure about that, especially for a python program.\n\n", "Q: Recomended Update Manager settings What is the recommended update manager settings for a newbie in Ubuntu?. ¿Software sources configuration ?¿Recommended updates are useful and not problematic?

That's probably why this is going to come out wordy.\nI have a Dell Inspiron 1501 laptop, and I've been looking around to see if there was a way for me to install the graphics driver (ATI IGP Xpress 1150) so I could use Unity 3D.  I wasn't sure if I was actually already running it, but I wanted to see if I could enable my graphics driver anyway.  As far as I knew, doing that would make things run smoother.  I followed the instructions someone placed here: Jockey not detecting my ATI IGP Xpress 1150 and it installed...something.\nThings were still working fine after I did that, so I went into Compiz to see what kind of things I could tweek.  I don't recall what the last thing I tried to enable was (it might have been Desktop Cube) but right after that, all the windows I had open lost their bars (forget the word for it, but you know the bar that has the minimize, restore and close buttons on it), the launcher disappeared, even the taskbar.  So I restarted my laptop, and now the workspace switcher, instead of a square that showed each workspace and allowed me to move up and down as well as left and right, is replaced with a straight rectangle that only allows me to move left and right (still with four workspaces).  I had only seen that before when I ran Unity 2D as a test, but I know I'm not using 2D, and I'd like to go back.\nFor what it's worth, I don't think it really had anything to do with me attempting to install the driver.  As things are now, things are moving less laggy on my screen.  But I really liked the way the workspace switcher had worked up until now.  I think it was something in Compiz that I accidentally disabled for something else, but I'm not sure where to begin to rectify that.\n\nA: Answer edited out from the question\n\nSo I was just about ready to do something drastic when I figured out\n  how to both uninstall fglrx and reset whatever tweaks I had made in\n  Compiz, everything seems to be working fine now.\n\n\nA: the reason it fails is because Unity is a Compiz plugin and you have deactivated that plugin. The reason you did this is because Unity depends on the \"LargeDesktop\" feature which is a feature provided by \"Wall\" and \"Cube\". Great, you may think, I can use either. Well the problem is that when you switch from wall to cube you have to remove wall, then activate cube. Removing wall removes the largedesktop feature momentarily, and in that fraction of a second when you have no largedesktop providing pluging the unity plugin gets unloaded. You need to turn this back on by running ccsm in your unity2d session and checking the box on the unity plugin. You can then go back to 3d. In 12.04 I patched the unity plugin so the daft and pointless dependency has been removed so people don't break their desktops.\n", "Q: What's the fairest way to monitor total CPU time - per user? On a multi user system, I want to measure each user's CPU usage in seconds of cpu time. For the purpose of this measurement, I assume that if a PID belongs to a user, this user is causing the CPU time - that is I'm ignoring daemons and the kernel.\nCurrently I'm doing this, every five seconds:\n\n\n*\n\n*Get each user and the PIDs they are running via ps aux\n\n*For each PID, get x, the sum of utime, cutime, stime and cstime from /proc/[pid]/stat\n\n*calculate t = x / interval (interval isn't always exactly 5 seconds when there's high load)\n\n\nIf I run this, I get sensible looking values. For instance: A user on this system was spinning in python (while True: pass), and the system was showing round about 750 milliseconds of CPU time per second. When the system hung for a bit, it reported 1600ms for one 1-second inverval. Which seems about right, but I undestand that these values can be deceiptful, especially given I don't really understand them.\nSo my question is this:\nWhat is a fair and correct way to measure CPU load on a per-user basis?\nThe method has to be rather accurate. There might be many hundreds of users on this system, so extracting percentages from ps aux will not be accurate enough, especially for short-lived threads which many pieces of software like to spawn.\nWhile this might be complicated, I absolutely know it's possible. This was my starting point:\n\nThe kernel keeps track of a processes creation time as well as the CPU time that it consumes during its lifetime. Each clock tick, the kernel updates the amount of time in jiffies that the current process has spent in system and in user mode.  — (from the Linux Documentation Project)\n\nThe value I'm after is the amount of seconds (or jiffies) that a user has spend on the CPU, not a percentage of system load or cpu usage.\nIt's important that we measure CPU time while the processes are still running. Some processes will only last for half a second, some will last for many months - and we need to catch both sorts, so that we can account for users' CPU time with fine granularity.\n\nA: This will give a line for each user showing the username and their total cpu time:\nps -w -e --no-header -o uid,user \\\n        | sort -u \\\n        | while read uid user; do\n                echo -e \"$user\\t\"$(\n                        ps --no-headers -u $uid --cumulative -o time \\\n                                | sed -e s/:/*3600+/ -e s/:/*60+/ \\\n                                | paste -sd+ \\\n                                | bc\n                );\n        done\n\n\nA: One of the more obvious answers is to just extend what you're currently doing now.  \nI came across this monitor process for using bash scripting and mysql to track the cpu time of users but it was spanned across a much larger time frame than you were talking about.\nHopefully this can give you some more ideas about the direction you're looking to head in.\nhttp://www.dba-oracle.com/t_oracle_unix_linux_vmstat_capture.htm\n\nA: Sounds like you need process accounting.\nhttp://www.faqs.org/docs/Linux-mini/Process-Accounting.html\nOn Ubuntu, the process accounting tools are in the acct package \nTo get a per-user report, run\nsa -m\n\n\nA: This will also handle processes that have been running for days..not sure how to expand for weeks/months/years..\nps -w -e --no-header -o uid,user \\\n    | sort -u \\\n    | while read uid user; do\n            echo -e \"$user\\t\"$(\n                    ps --no-headers -u $uid --cumulative -o time \\\n                          | sed -e s/-/*86400+/ -e s/:/*3600+/ -e s/:/*60+/ \n                          | paste -sd+ \\\n                          | bc\n            );\n    done\n\n", "Q: Is there a dictionary feature in VIM I use vim for pretty much all my typing work.

When installing Ubuntu am I gonna put it on a CD or DVD-R?

Normally we burn the version \"CD\" .iso in a real CD but you can burn it in a DVD or using unetbootin and an USB (>=1GB) to make a bootable Usb. It's okay.

How do I get my pc to add my AV receiver to it so I can use it for sound ouput? I am trying to get sound from my pc that is connected to my av receiver. Do I need to load a driver or something? I have AV receiver and my pc in connected to it using HDMI and AV receiver to TV HDMI. I am not getting sound out of my PC to my AV receiver but video is getting to TV.\n\nA: Does the TV support sound? Check if you can get sound out with the TV disconnected from the AV Receiver.\nWhile my setup is a bit different (Computer:HDMI --> AV Reciever:HDMI --> TV:DVI) I've learned that the EDID the PC saw was that of the TV. As the TV had DVI and not HDMI, the PC didn't think sound was supported and only sent video. Thanks to the drivers not having an override function (nVidia, Windows) I had to create a custom cable between the AV and TV that blocked the EDID of the TV. Thus the EDID of the AV was instead sent to the Computer and I got my sound and video.\n(The cable was a 6\" HDMI with its data lines cut :P its a good SONY AV reciever, so the computer still allows HDCP playback! but YMMV)\n", "Q: Perl Script Permissions I'm having a few problems with running a Perl script. Every time I try to run it (its from a runescape launcher client), it give me the following message in terminal: Permission Denied\nHow can i fix this? \n\nA: There are two possibilities.\n\n\n*\n\n*The script itself doesn't have execute permissions.  Solution:\n\n\nchmod +x script-name\n\n\n*\n\n*(less likely) The interpreter specified on the shebang line is not executable.\n\n\nNormally the first line of the script should be:\n#!/usr/bin/perl\n\nIf it is, and if the script itself is executable, then try this:\nif [ -x /usr/bin/perl ] ; then echo ok ; else echo OOPS ; fi\n\nor, if your default shell is csh or tcsh:\nsh -c 'if [ -x /usr/bin/perl ] ; then echo ok ; else echo OOPS ; fi'\n\nIf that prints ok, then something very strange is going on.  If it prints OOPS, then your Perl interpreter is not executable -- which probably indicates that it was installed incorrectly.  If that's the case, I'm not going to suggest a quick fix.\nAnother thought: Does the message result from executing the script itself, or from something it does?\nDo you see the error when you execute the script from a command line?  If so, if you add\nprint \"Hello\\n\";\n\nnear the top of the script does \"Hello\" appear before the \"Permission denied\" message?  If so, then the problem is somewhere in the script (about which we have no information).  You should be able to narrow it down yourself.\n\nA: I figured out what it was.

I currently have Windows 7 on my computer and I want to install Ubuntu alongside Windows safely.\nCould someone please provide clear instructions?\n\nA: Start by going to ubuntu.com. On the homepage, scroll down and click the red \"Get Ubuntu Now\" button.\n\nUnder \"Ways to get Ubuntu\", select \"Download and Install\".\n\nThis will take you to a page where you can choose which version of Ubuntu you want to download and then download it. You need to download the right version of Ubuntu for your computer, 32 bit or 64 bit. 64-bit is much faster than 32-bit if your computer can support it. While in Windows, open the Start Menu. Right-click on the word \"Computer\" and click Properties.\n\nIn the window that opens, under the system category, note the \"system type\". If the type is listed as 32-bit operating system, select the 32-bit option from the dropdown menu on ubuntu.com, then click Start Download. If your system is 64-bit, select the 64-bit option from the dropdown and click \"Start Download\".\n\nOnce the ISO file has finished downloading, open Windows Explorer and find the downloaded file. It should be in your \"Downloads\" folder unless you chose to save it somewhere else. Once you locate the file, right click on it, click the \"Open With...\" option and then select \"Windows Disc Image Burner\".\n\nMake sure you have the right CD burner selected, and that the \"Verify Disc After Burning\" box is checked. Click burn, go get a cup of coffee, and come back.\nOnce the disc has finished burning, eject the disc and shutdown the computer. Put the disc into the drive and press the power button. Now, you'll notice that somewhere on the screen displaying your computer manufacturer's logo, usually off in a corner of the screen, some text saying which key you need to press to enter additional boot options.\nOn my computer, which is an HP laptop, it says \"ESC Pause Startup\". On some computers, it's F12 or F2 or ESC, etc. and the key you have to press varies from computer to computer. Once you know what key to press, press that key before the computer reaches the \"Starting Windows\" screen. The screen that you reach will vary from computer to computer, in my case the screen looks like this:\n\nSome computers will enter directly into computer setup, some will provide you with an option to boot from the CD or DVD drive without changing settings in the BIOS. The process to get a computer to boot from the CD or DVD drive varies greatly from computer to computer, but is relatively straightforward. Refer to the documentation for your computer on the manufacturer's website if you need any additional assistance.\nWhen you get the computer to successfully boot from the CD containing Ubuntu, you should first get a screen with a stick figure and a keyboard. Press any key at this point to change the installer language, otherwise, to leave it to the default English, don't press anything. After that for several minutes, depending on the speed of your CD/DVD drive and of your computer, you should see a screen like this:\n\nBe patient while the computer loads Ubuntu from the CD. When the loading has completed, you should arrive at a screen similar to the one below:\n\nOnce this screen has loaded, click \"Install Ubuntu\". The next screen:\n\nBe sure that all the requirements are met. If you need to connect through Wi-Fi because you want to be able to download updates during the installer, saving you the need to update afterwards, then use the Wifi Menu in the top left corner of the screen.\nIn the next screen, you can select whether or not you want to dual boot, since you do, select \"Install Ubuntu alongside Windows 7\". Click Forward.\n\nYou can then select how much space you want to devote to Ubuntu by clicking and dragging the separator. When done, click \"Install Now\".\n\nThe rest of the installer is very self explanatory. It will guide you through naming your computer and creating a new user account, as well as giving you the option to import settings and files from your Windows account.

To do this try to get in to recovery mode, then drop in to root shell and do sudo apt-get remove fglrx it should bring things back to normal if not try deleting /etc/X11/xorg.conf (if its there fglrx has a habit of making one).

Lately I've been working on a development project making use of TI's MSP430 microcontroller (specifically the eZ430-RF2560). Over on this thread you can see we've been testing some code and have found that the output of the microcontroller over serial is garbled. The btstack provides simple counter test program. When we run the program and look at the serial port output using PuTTY on Windows 7 we see:\nrfcomm_send_internal cid 117 doesn't exist!\nBTstack counter 26230\nrfcomm_send_internal cid 117 doesn't exist!\nBTstack counter 26231\n\nHowever if we connect from various Ubuntu clients we get something like:\nStt.R. \nBTacn 0 \nBTacn 002BTacn 0 \nBTcct 04BTtacoe 5BTacun \n\nMy current belief is that this is because the device is being detected by cdc_acm as a generic USB ACM device. Another thread about a similar microcontroller suggests that the device should use a specific usb serial driver. We've verified that the module is compiled on our system and did a \"modprobe ti_usb_3410_5052\" but this had no effect on cdc_acm.

On my dual screen display I have a Unity Launcher on the left hand screen and also on the right hand screen. Both work perfectly fine.\nHowever, I don't want this second launcher present on my right hand screen. How could I remove this? If it matters, I'm using NVIDIA drivers with a TwinView setup.\n\n\nA: I just found a setting in gconf-editor that will allow you to set the launcher to just your primary desktop: /apps/compiz-1/plugins/unityshell/screen0/options/num_launchers. If you set it to 1, the Unity launcher will only be displayed on the primary desktop. If you set it to 0, the launcher will be available on all desktops.\nIn addition to this setting, I also set the the overcome pressure (/apps/compiz-1/plugins/unityshell/screen0/options/overcom_pressure=1) and stop velocity (/apps/compiz-1/plugins/unityshell/screen0/options/stop_velocity=20).\n\nA: I solved using disper. Type in a terminal:\nsudo apt-get install disper\n\nAfter solving the issue with the method proposed by Paŭlo Ebermann or nvidia-settings or whatever works for you, type in a terminal:\ndisper --export < /path-to-my-file/my-disper-file.metamode\n\nmy-file.metamode is as follows:\nbackend: nvidia\nassociated displays: DFP-0, DFP-1\nmetamode: DFP-0: 1366x768 @1366x768 +1920+312, DFP-1: 1920x1080 @1920x1080 +0+0\nscaling: stretched, stretched\nxinerama info order: DFP-1, DFP-0\n\nThe third row takes into account the particular positioning of two screens with different heights. Your case may be simpler. You could try to create the file that fits your configuration (without using other methods + disper --export).\nThe important point is the order of the screens in the second and in the last rows.\nYou can use the script and making it run at startup:\n#!/bin/sh\n#Auto switch single/extend display with disper on Multiple Monitor.\nlines=$(disper -l | wc -l)\ndisplay_count=$((lines / 2))\nif [ $display_count -eq \"1\" ]; then\n   disper -s\nelse\n   disper --import < /path-to-my-file/my-disper-file.metamode\nfi\n\nIt worked with my nvidia graphics card (both precise and quantal).\nHope it helps.\n\nA: The slowdown is a feature to make it possible to use the launcher when it's set to auto-hide. I think it's a bug that it's used when the launcher is set to always visible. I've reported it on Launchpad.net, where bugs are filed, and you might want to set it to affect you. You can find it here: https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/unity/+bug/945847\nIn the meantime, you can configure it yourself by using /apps/compiz-1/plugins/unityshell/screen0/options/overcome_pressure and /apps/compiz-1/plugins/unityshell/screen0/options/stop_velocity in gconf-editor\nYou can also configure these parameters in CCSM (Compiz Config Settings Manager), in the Unity Plugin, Experimental tab\n\nA: I tried the combined settings from above:\n/apps/compiz-1/plugins/unityshell/screen0/options/num_launchers=1\n/apps/compiz-1/plugins/unityshell/screen0/options/overcom_pressure=1\n/apps/compiz-1/plugins/unityshell/screen0/options/stop_velocity=20\n\nThat was mostly successful for me.  A launcher appears only on the primary screen, and the mouse moves from one screen to the next without undue hesitation.  However, I found that the remaining launcher would not reveal without using the super key.  This can be corrected by setting the following:\n/apps/compiz-1/plugins/unityshell/screen0/options/reveal_pressure=1\n\nBTW this is with NVidia drivers.\n\nA: You can now.\nOpen up Display preferences, and then you can choose between having the launcher on one display or all of them.\n\nThis dialog also allows switching on or off the sticky edges (i.e. the mouse slowdown) between the displays.\n\nA: Just changing /apps/compiz-1/plugins/unityshell/screen0/options/stop_velocity to 1 fixed the issue for me... I didn't necessarily want to remove the second taskbar, just didn't like the pause when going from one screen to the other.\n", "Q: Shotwell, grouping photos by folder possible? Shotwell lists photos based on when they were taken. While this is fine for single-day \"trips\" (ie Saturday at the park) it is awefull for photos taken in a lengthy trips (ie My month in Italy) as each day would be an entry on the left panel instead a group. Having over 30K photos organized in directories, is there any way Shotwell will keep my photo structure and create one event per folder? \n\nA: The simplest way to achieve this is with tags, not events. The short answer is to manually import folder-by-folder, and tag each batch of imports.  \nThe first decision you have to make is whether to preserve your directory structure, and keep pictures in folders like you have them now. Shotwell defaults to a date directory structure, you have an event structure.  \nIf you don't care, have all the photos outside /Pictures, and import one folder at a time using File/Import from folder... . Tag each batch as you go. All your photos will be reorganized in /Pictures based on dates.  \nIf you want to keep the event structure, make sure to un-check the 'Watch library directory for new files' in Edit/Preferences/Library. Move all the folders with photos into /Pictures. Then import one at at a time, again tagging each batch of imports as you go. You will have to keep maintaining the library from then on, manually importing photos.\n", "Q: Blank screen after Ubuntu logo appears when booting wubi I tried wubi but it didn't start up after the first boot.

This time as my HDD had some factory problems, Lenovo replace it for free. So, I have a fresh new HDD on which I would like to use Ubuntu (I did have some hands-on experience on Ubuntu for 1 yr).\nBut I am worried whether the special features of lenovo would work in it as I didn't get drivers for Linux when I brought my laptop. Neither they are present in the website. \nI use Lenovo G570.\n\n\n*\n\n*Does the one key recovery system work in Ubuntu and how do I install it?\n\n\nA: On a N586, I have just installed 12.10 alongside Windows 7 and kept the OKR working.  I did not find an exact how-to anywhere on line, so did it my way.  It worked (so far !). You need to be comfortable repartitioning.\nProblem is that Lenonv uses 4 primary partitions for their Windows 7 install.  Solution is to turn the main Windows_OS partition C: into a logical one - this works because Windows actually boots from the 200MB SYSTEM partition which is still primary.  Then you can shrink the C: drive and run the Ubuntu install which will use the remaining space.  I contemplated making the D: drive logical as well, but was not sure if OKR would get upset.  Seems simple but it took ages to make it happen.\nI have Windows 7, Ubuntu and OKR all working.\nSome specifics:\n\n\n*\n\n*Make rescue disk and full recovery disk set first!  Most folks recommend two copies, just in case.\n\n*I used a bootable partitioning tool (GParted) to re-characterize the Windows_OS space\n\n*Then back into Windows to use the Disk Management tool to shrink the windows partition (hint:  defragment it first to shift some files down)\n\n*Then run Ubuntu install.  You could manually partition, but I tried the \"install alongside....\" option and it worked a dream\nAs for hardware compatibility, the only thing I'm struggling with is the internal microphone.

So, as I have very less (in fact nothing) knowledge on Linux File System hierarchy, I thought some would be helping me to choose the best one.\nHere is what I briefly do on Ubuntu.\n\n\n*\n\n*Learn programming (should maintain my project files) # I am a student.\n(Sometimes, I had to install few external packages too. Though they never were more than 200 MB each)\n\n*I use software's like Matlab, Netbeans, Eclipse etc.\n\n*Store lots of music, movies, photos\n\n*I have a good set of ebooks, office documents (includes documentations of packages).\n\n*Download many files..\n\n\nThis is what a normal user would probably do.\nWhat I am actually searching for is that, how do I maintain all those file if I have created only 2 partitions \"/\" and \"/home\". Of course, all of these would come under \"/home\". Wouldn't they look messy??\nI windows, I could create 4 partitions, each of them I use for different purposes.\nActually, I have gone through Ubuntu Linux File System hierarchy and got to know that each directory has some special significance. Thus each directory should be used for their respective purposes (as recommended). \nSo, I want to know how should I partition my HDD and what directories should I mount them to those partitions and what kind of files should I place in them.\n\nA: The good thing about Ubuntu is you really don't need to worry about disk partitions. If you are a normal user, and from your description, you are, you can go with the defaults quite happily, unless you have a burning desire to mess around, or if you have something which could increase in size in such a way as to fill up a partition (eg logging very verbose logs into /home could end up filling it and causing you problems, so doing that is generally not recommended)\nFilesystems under unixes are not messy once you understand the structure - it is actually much more straightforward than Windows, for example.\nYou can of course move any part of your filesystem wherever you want - I tend to have my main music store (an external terabyte disk) mounted at /home/music but I could have put it anywhere.\nDefault under Ubuntu: Two partitions\n\n\n*\n\n*/\n\n*swap\n\n\nCommon alternative: Three partitions\n\n\n*\n\n*/\n\n*/home\n\n*swap\n\n\nA: The data you will do with could be defined such useful way: \n\n\n*\n\n*OS files come from installation\n\n*Various settings defined on per user basis - .bashrc, .vimrc, and most of those hidden sub direcories in users home directories\n\n*optional packages you'll want to install later in /opt, /usr/local\n\n*A lot of media files: movies, music, photos, ebooks, etc.\n\n*Backup data. In case you don't have a separate drive (internal or external) you may find useful to have backup partition to save your data from deletion by mistake or from accidental damage of origin partition. \n\n\nIt is convenient to separate these sorts of data. The obvious division is sorting out media files to separate partition. It is convenient to keep your home clean and small,e.g. to speed up grep-ing and find-ing in it. Also to simplify archiving and backing up. There are other reasons for data partitioning.\nI partitioned my 1Tb disk such way:\nFilesystems            Size Used  Avail  Used% mounted\n/dev/sda3            1008M  408M  550M  43% /\nnone                  493M  292K  493M   1% /dev\n/dev/sda7             5,0G  196M  4,5G   5% /tmp\n/dev/sda5              97M   52M   41M  56% /boot\n/dev/sda10             35G    4G   31G  11% /home\n/dev/sda6              15G  6,6G  7,5G  48% /usr\n/dev/sda8             9,9G  1,3G  8,1G  14% /var\n/dev/sda9             693G   62G  596G  10% /data\n/dev/sda11            158G   15G  135G  10% /backup\n\nI use my ubuntu about 2 years and data fit given limits with significant reserve. But now I find that putting /boot, /var, /tmp and /usr to separate partitions is redundant, and if I need I divide my disk a bit different way:\n  4G swap of doubled RAM size\n 30G /\n 16G /home which will contain users application settings and documents and specific software like RVM (ruby version manager)\n750G /data  with large and numerous media files\n200G /backup  \n\nAlso I find useful to make ~/Downloads, /opt, ~/Music soft links to /data subfolders\nI also use backuppc which automates backing up to backup partition.\n\nA: None of the recommendations here mentions that in a manual partitioning set up one MUST include at least 35Mb EFI boot partition for the grub and other boot data to go into.  I didn't know this and wonder why my 2Tb hard drive would not boot up after installation.\nLuckily when I went to reinstall and selected the option to \"Erase and reinstall\" on ubuntu 13.10 it threw up a message telling me what had to be done.\n\nA: You don't mention whether you're wanting dual boot with windows. Some folk have to because there are Windows programs with no current linux alternative -for instance, Dragon Dictate, an excellent speech recognition program or the Rosetta Stone line of language programs.\nRegardless of your dual booting needs, I would recommend four partitions for linux. \n/root  - 10Gb ~ 15Gb  Ext 4 (sounds a lot but opting for a really small /root \n                       can give problems later)\n/swap  - 1Gb\n/home  - 20GB ~ 40Gb  Ext 4 (This range regardless of dual booting or not)\n/win   - Taking up the rest of your HD, formatted as ntfs.  Why ntfs? I'll explain\n         my preference like this:  if you ensure you have ntfs-3g and ntfs-config\n         installed then after a few moments with ntfs-config you will be able to read and write to your ntfs partition(s) and to external devices too, which is useful. You would be able to store data on the ntfs partition you created.  This is good because, with a little work on samba, you should be able to share that data with a networked Win machine,  and vice versa. Additionally, if booted into Windows, you would be able to see the /win partition, potentially useful for exchanging data between OS. This is thanks to the open nature of linux: Windows machines can not easily 'see' linux partitions.  Please do not think I'm setting out to 'talk dirty' by mentioning Windows: I live in the real world and recognise that many linux users have no option but to use both OS. Mostly, I use Ubuntu or Debian on my network, with an unavoidable Win machine.\nAt any rate, now you know my recommended setup. (I also recommend Ubuntu Tweak!)\nHTH\n", "Q: Command last does not show logins through sFTP, is there something similar or any logs?

Any help with these issues would be much appreciated as I'm in over my head here.\n\nA: *\n\n*I do not know about the partitions (1), but \n\n*I would guess it could be that your system has a graphics card/chip with shared video memory, like the graphic chips which are part of Intel iCore processors. If this is true, that missing memory is reserved for the graphics. This may be the case even if your system has also a dedicated graphics card with its own video ram. Also, some cards may have its own video ram, but it can be expanded by shared RAM. It should be possible to set the amount of RAM dedicated for the graphics in the BIOS, and maybe also in some manufacturer tools within original Windows, if it came with that OS. In the case of system with dedicated video card along with a built-in one with shared video RAM, it should be possible to disable the later (again in BIOS) if it is not used.\n\n*Such problems can be solved by boot parameters, try to look for example at this:\nhttp://linux.koolsolutions.com/2009/08/04/howto-fix-linux-hangfreeze-during-reboots-and-restarts/ \nhttp://help.ubuntu.com/community/BootOptions\n", "Q: Encrypted NTFS folders and Ubuntu I have about 100 GB folder on a NTFS partition that I would like to make inaccessible in Ubuntu. TrueCrypt is not an option as there's only 5 GB of free space and there's no way to create large enough container file to move the file. Ubuntu is installed using Wubi on the same partition, so I cannot disable mounting.\nWith this train of thought I figured that the only option I have is to encrypt the folder using Windows Properties. So my question is if I do this will Ubuntu be able to access the folder. Will it be possible to decrypt it in case my Windows goes down?\nThe thing is that I want only one user to be able to access it.\n\nA: Here's what I did to set this up. It works like charm now. I decided to post this as an answer so that any one with a similar situation have it:\n\n\n*\n\n*Created a EXT4 and SWAP partition with a partition manager. Boot sector got corrupted, so be careful here.\n\n*Migrated Wubi to a real partition. Performance is remarkably better. More info here: http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=1519354\n\n*Moved all files files from the NTFS partition, except for the ones I was willing to protect. Used TrueCrypt from Windows to encrypt the entire non system NTFS partition. http://www.truecrypt.org/docs/?s=tutorial\nNow I have my files secured both on Windows and Linux, and I am able to mount them on both ends whenever I have to.\n\nA: Here are the options that I see for you. I have attempted to correct the answer that you graciously accepted before I took in account that your folder is on your Wubi /host filesystem and that makes a huge difference.\nOption 1. Encrypt your folder using EncFS. You'll need enough working storage somewhere in order to create the encrypted folder. In Windows you could use encfs4win (free, \"experimental\") or BoxCryptor ($40) to encrypt and decrypt the folder. In Ubuntu you would use EncFS and FUSE as explained here: http://www.arg0.net/encfsintro\nOption 2 (incompletely worked out). It sounds like you want to prevent some other Ubuntu users from accessing that folder when it is mounted. For that purpose, another method is to use file and directory permissions rather than encryption.\nThere's a difficulty here. Wubi doesn't enable you to control the Linux ownership and permissions for the individual Windows files and directories on the partition containing the virtual disk(s) (which it puts in /host). You can control the Linux ownership and permissions for the partition as a whole by editing with gksudo gedit /etc/default/grub  the ntfs-3g \"uid\", \"gid\", and \"umask\" options in line GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT=\"rootflags=<options go here> quiet splash\". If you need more information about the options, that can be found in man ntfs-3g.\nOption 3. Move the 100 Gb folder to a separate NTFS partition or drive. Then you could use the normal /etc/fstab mechanism to mount it and the partition-level permissions and ownership would be sufficient for the access control that you need. Again you would need information about the options from man ntfs-3g.\nOption 4 (incompletely explained). Converting from Wubi to a real Linux partition would make it possible to mount the Windows partition via the normal /etc/fstab mechanism. Then you could reasonably consider building ntfs-3g from source with the --enable-posix-acls in the configure command. That would give you control over permissions in a manner that is compatible between Linux and Windows. Further information: http://b.andre.pagesperso-orange.fr/permissions.html\nIn any case, make sure that those other users don't have root access. Normally they do not, but you'll want to be sure. To prevent specific Ubuntu users from having root access via sudo, you can \"open the Users and Groups tool from System->Administration menu. Then click on the user and then on properties. Choose the User Privileges tab. In the tab, find Administer the system and [un]check that.\" (Quote from https://help.ubuntu.com/community/RootSudo)\n", "Q: How to Make Permanent Changes to Default user-dirs.dirs?

This means that the guest OS only has a virtual graphics adapter to operate.\nTo answer your question: Yes, it is definfitely possible to view the screen of your Virtual Box guest Windows on a monitor or beamer attached to your Ubuntu host computer provided Ubuntu is able to adress it (which is very likely the case). You don't even need any additional drivers for Windows. When running Virtual Box in full screen mode it will operate very similar (but slower) to a native Windows.\nThe present release of Virtual Box allows providing multiple virtual monitors, all of which can be displayed from the host OS.

On Windows, I could change how much RAM Java could use by typing something like -Xincgc -Xmx2048M in the Java Runtime Parameters. How can I do that in Ubuntu? \n\nA: If I am not mistaken they are the same in Linux. With the Java command you have the 2 options:\n\n*\n\n*Xmx sets the maximum memory heap size.\n\n*Xms sets the minimum memory heap size.\n\nSo doing -Xmx1024m -Xms128m should work.\nHere is an extract from doing a man java in the terminal\n-Xmsn\n                Specify the initial size, in bytes, of the memory allocation\n                pool. This value must be a multiple of 1024 greater than 1MB.\n                Append the letter k or K to indicate kilobytes, or m or M to\n                indicate megabytes. The default value is chosen at runtime\n                based on system configuration. For more information, see\n                HotSpot Ergonomics\n                Examples:\n\n                       -Xms6291456\n                       -Xms6144k\n                       -Xms6m\n\n -Xmxn\n                Specify the maximum size, in bytes, of the memory allocation\n                pool.

So xmx1024M is not the same as Xmx1024M.\n\nA: The same applies on Linux.

Modify the .profile file in your home directory (or .bash_profile if it exists and you use bash) to include this line:\nexport JAVA_OPTS='-Xincgc -Xmx2048M'\n\nAfter setting this, you need to restart shell sessions for it to apply.\nAlternatively, you can also modify the system-wide profile in /etc/profile. \nEdit: Settings for the Java Browser Plugin are defined in the Java Control Panel: http://docs.oracle.com/javase/1.4.2/docs/guide/plugin/developer_guide/control_panel.html. \n", "Q: Desktop icon size editing with nautilus Icons on my desktop look very big even after setting the icon view defaults to 50% in nautilus preferences.\n\n\nPlease help in fixing this issue?\n\nA: you can just Right click on icon and select Resize Icon option in popup window...\nIt will show u a dotted rectangle around icon, and then u can resize it to anyhow u want.\nfor more details, visit resizing desktop icon\n", "Q: How do I know whether my graphic drivers are installed or not I have installed Ubuntu 11.10 on my lenovo laptop and found a \"chip\" image on the top of the screen.

The dark areas which appear at the top and bottom of the screen aren't visible on my physical monitor, but the OS continues to place icons there and some applications even start there.  Does anyone know how to get rid of this surplus space ?\n\nA: Set the higher resolution monitor to be your primary monitor.  Steps for this vary depending on what driver you're using, if it supports xrandr, whether or not you're using xinerama, and if you're tweaking your xorg.conf among other things.  \nSo no step by step.

When I was using Win7, it was very nice, cool. \nWhy this is happening and how do I fix it.\ndetails:\nLenovo G570; Ubuntu 11.10 32-bit\n\nA: There are several issues with overheating in 11.10. At least most of those are fixed in Precise (which will become 12.04). I had similar issues with all my computers on 11.10, but never since. (Never before 11.10 either). \nIf you really want to get into it, you can try upgrading your kernel. Or maybe you'll rather want to upgrade to 12.04 Beta 1 on the first of March. Of course, you could always download it now and try it in a memory stick  or something, just to confirm that all the issues have been resolved. They should. \n\nA: Assuming you have an Intel based system like my Lenovo X220 you could try appending i915.i915_enable_rc6=1 to your boot command line, which works for me. YMMV\n\nA: Try dimming the screen brightness.  I have an Acer laptop that will get hot if I try running more than email and a browser.  Tried everything written about temp problems except a bios update.  Last night I dimmed my screen brightness down to 60%, was able to burn DVD, watch full screen video, email and browser, and download a torrent.  Laptop was warm, but did not get hot.  Full screen video would do it in less than 5 minutes before.\n\nA: I had same problem on my HP ProBook4530s (I have i5 and ATI Radeon graphic card).\nYou should try activate \"ATI/ADM proprietary FGLRX graphics driver\" (post-release updates in my case).\nSystem Settings -> Additional Drivers\n\nA: Just might be because your laptop hasn't undergone a complete service. Just go to any laptop repair shop and give your laptop a good service... heat sync. fan gets out of order because of the garbage stuck inside the ventilator, resultantly it doesn't let the heat out of the laptop...

Then look at portrait and landscape, mine was set to the opposite proportions. Write down the #'s, mine says 8.26x11.69. DON'T select landscape, that will show your pages as landscape and print them that way, so if you go onto a second page but shouldn't, it will split it up.

It's so much more easy and customizable than Gnome. It allows you to have complete control over the panels (removing, resizing, etc.), so that's what I would recommend (Kubuntu). Just open software center, install kubuntu-desktop (you have to click \"show hidden files\" to be able to see it, and then you can have a desktop with only cairo-dock. Install \"lancelot\" for Cairo-Dock, to have a menu, and I think that's all you need.\nI tried doing this with Gnome before, but after I disabled the Ubuntu Unity plugin in Compiz-Config, I still had an ugly bar at the top with File, View, Edit, and a whole bunch of other junky stuff. Too bad, because I was actually enjoying CCSM more than Kwin, but in the end, I think moving was a good decision--you won't regret it! In fact, you can even user Compiz as your window manager instead of Kwin if you want, although I've never found a need for that.\nHowever, I do have to admit, although I did try pretty hard and researched quite a bit, there still might be a way that I don't know about, so if you don't want to give up Gnome, then keep searching.\n\nA: Off Topic of Cairo-\nDocky with Cardapio Mini mode\n\nhttp://www.webupd8.org/2010/11/cardapio-menu-update-brings-docky.html\n", "Q: How do I change my resolution to 1600*900 for a wide screen monitor?

Or, to avoid rebooting:\nsudo swapoff -a\n\nThe downside if you entirely turn off swap is that you're left with no \"safety net\" if your processes start needing more memory than physically available. If you're confident that is not going to happen, it should be OK to disable swap.\nRead here:\nIs it safe to turn swap off permanently? \nThis has a very good explanation of whether it's safe to turn swap off and what swappiness means; swappiness 0 means it won't touch the swap file unless absolutely necessary (i.e. out of memory).\nNow, if you want to minimize writes entirely there are other things you need to look into, such as logging for your applications (i.e. you probably don't want them writing logs to the USB flash).

answers:\n\n\n*\n\n*Open System Monitor and see what is the memory consumption and which process is eating away your CPU. You can also get similar results using \"top\" command in the terminal. It will show you which process is running frequently. \n\n*You have good laptop configuration. Since you are using 32bit Ubuntu, your OS will not be able to take advantage memory beyond 3Gb ( Since you are CS student, I think you will figure it out why). You will not get noticeable performance improvement by using 64Bit Ubuntu.\n\n*Your Windows 7 installation on different partition does not have any impact on your Ubuntu's performance. So there is no need of removing it, unless you want to completely switch to Ubuntu.\n\nA: There are many ways to see what programs are currently running, System Monitor is included default in Ubuntu, you can also use the command top in the Terminal. you can change what programs startup in Startup Applications. all of these programs you can find in the Ubuntu Dash.\nThats odd that your computer is running slowly with that kind of CPU and that much memory. Maybe somethings up with your hard drive which is causing a slowdown? a 64-Bit Operating System can defiantly improve performance, be careful with comparability of software though. i recommend it however.\nHave you added any extra hardware or removed any since you started noticing the performance problems?\nAgain check your hard drives health, check BIOS Settings make sure nothing important is disabled. make sure you have proper graphics drivers installed in the Additional Drivers Tool. you may want to follow the tips from http://linux-software-news-tutorials.blogspot.com/2011/03/how-to-speed-up-ubuntu.html\nor \ni honestly don't think running Windows 7 in a Virtual Machine would help all that much.\na Reinstall and Reformat should defiantly help.\n", "Q: Why doesn't Skype start? I downloaded and installed Skype, but by clicking the icon it just does not start. \nWhat should I do?\n\nA: I've had the same problem. Followed the answer here https://askubuntu.com/a/322347/115308, and it is working now.\n\nA: It's always good to open a terminal and issue the command from there. Failure will at the least reports some output.\nOpen a terminal and issue the command:\nskype\n\nA: Just to be sure. You downloaded and installed Skype through Ubuntu's Software Center.\nI recommend doing it this way. But in all cases, Skype has a particular issue that if you start it 2 or more times it gets stuck if you did not close it properly.\nDo the following in a terminal:\nsudo killall skype or sudo killall -9 skype. That should force skype to close even if you do not see it. It kills the Skype process.\nAfter which I also recommend putting the Skype icon in the Launcher. This way, if you double click on it, it will not open twice. It will just open normally and the second click will make it get focus.\n\nA: Make sure that you install 32-bit / 64-bit Skype on respective hardware.  Installing from the Ubuntu Software Center automatically decides what version is appropriate.\n\nA: When starting Skype, a native 32 bit binary, in a 64 bit environment you might run into the following error and Skype refuses to start:\n\nskype: error while loading shared libraries: libGL.so.1: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory\n\nSo far I only had this problem on 64 bit. The following solution solved it:\n# ln -s /usr/lib/mesa-diverted/i386-linux-gnu/libGL.so.1 /usr/lib/i386-linux-gnu/\n\n\nSource : https://wiki.debian.org/skype#Problems_starting_Skype\n\nA: The fact that the problem was posted in such a general form makes it applicable to recent developments.\nIn Kubuntu 18.04 downloading and installing the deb file I can only start it once, log in, without any way of accessing contacts etc. Closing and restarting it appeared in tray but would not start. Running skype in terminal it says uninstalled, recommends to use\nsudo snap install skype\n\nDoing that (after uninstalling skypeforlinux) it asks me to use\nsudo snap install skype --classic\n\nwhich successfully installs a working Skype.\n", "Q: Java GUI extremely slow I'm writing a Java app and the GUI is extremely slow on my Ubuntu 11.10 64bit setup. It takes a few seconds to respond to some action. \nIt runs flawlessly on both Max OS X and Windows 7, it actually works just fine on a fresh Ubuntu 11.10(both 32 and 64bit) VirtualBox running on Win7.\nI have already tried three different Java versions and it didn't help.\nWhat could be the problem?\nCurrent Java version:\njava -version\njava version \"1.6.0_26\"\nJava(TM) SE Runtime Environment (build 1.6.0_26-b03)\nJava HotSpot(TM) 64-Bit Server VM (build 20.1-b02, mixed mode)\n\n\nA: You might want to try installing version 1.7 (oracle's one, not openjdk), and making sure it is the active version using update-alternatives and java -version.\nDo note, however, that java is NOT a fast technology. Your applications are compiled to intermediate bytecode which needs to be interpreted by a fairly heavy application called the JVM. Although I don't remember ever having experienced multiple seconds of interface lag, I do know the GUI's written in java tend to be slow.\nI've never noticed any difference between windows 7 and ubuntu/opensuse though (each 64-bit), but that might be due to the version: I always get the latest official java sdk (that is, from Oracle).\n--\nAlthough this might not be the answer you'd like to hear, if you don't explicitely need java (which you would if you were targetting mobile devices, I suppose) and/or if performance is important for your application, you might want to look for a native-compiled alternative. C++ with Qt would be an excellent alternative, if you're familiar with C++. It keeps your application cross-platform, without affecting the general performance.\nMono/C# comes with an option to precompile the bytecode, so you basicly have a native executable with the mono runtime included (heavy at startup, but faster than java at runtime).\n\nA: By your description, I would be it's a video driver issue. Looks for performance related issues regarding your video card in ubuntu. Inside a VM, ubuntu uses a VM-specific driver that have nothing in common with the hardware\n", "Q: How to create animated GIF images of a screencast? I've seen animated GIF images of screen casts (like the one below) promoted a few times on this site as a way to improve answers.\n\nWhat toolchain is being used to create these? Is there a program that does this automagically, or are people taking screencasts, converting them into a series of static frames, and then creating the GIF images? \n\nA: There are all sorts of complicated and well-working (presumably) ways to do this listed here. However, I've never wanted to go through that process before nor since. So, I simply use an online converter which suits my needs the few times I need to do so. I've used this site: \nhttp://ezgif.com/video-to-gif \nIt's not my site and I'm not affiliated with them in any way. They're just the one in my bookmarks and there are many more.\n\nA: I created record-gif.sh, an improved version of Rob W's byzanz-record-region:\n\nA lame GUI for byzanz, improved the user experience (mouse-selectable area, record progress bar, replay-able recording).\n\n\n\n\n*\n\n*set recording duration ;\n\n*set save_as destination ;\n\n*select –with the mouse– the area to record ;\n\n*create a script to replay recording (cf. $HOME/record.again).\n\n\nInstall\nI also created an installation script\ncurl --location https://git.io/record-gif.sh | bash -\n\n\nA: ffmpeg (install)\nOne of the best tools I use is ffmpeg.  It can take most video from a screencast tool such as kazam and convert it to another format.\nInstall this from software-center - it is automatically installed if you install the excellent ubuntu-restricted-extras package.\nKazam can output in the video formats mp4 or webm.  Generally you get better results outputting in mp4 format.\nExample GIF making syntax\nThe basic syntax to convert video to gif is:\nffmpeg -i [inputvideo_filename] -pix_fmt rgb24 [output.gif]\n\nGIFs converted - especially those with a standard 25/29 frame-per-second can be very large.  For example - a 800Kb webm 15-second video at 25fps can output to 435 MB!\nYou can reduce this by a number of methods:\nFramerate\nUse the option -r [frame-per-second]. For example \nffmpeg -i Untitled_Screencast.webm -r 1 -pix_fmt rgb24 out.gif\n\nSize reduced from 435 MB to 19 MB\nFile-size limit\nUse the option -fs [filesize]. For example \nffmpeg -i Untitled_Screencast.webm -fs 5000k -pix_fmt rgb24 out.gif\n\nNote: This is an approximate output file size so the size can be slightly bigger than specified.\nSize of output video\nUse the option -s [widthxheight]. For example \nffmpeg -i Untitled_Screencast.webm -s 320x200 -pix_fmt rgb24 out.gif\n\nThis reduced the example 1366x768 video size down to 26 MB\nLoop forever\nSometimes you might want the GIF to loop forever.\nUse the option -loop_output 0. For example \nffmpeg -i Untitled_Screencast.webm -loop_output 0 -pix_fmt rgb24 out.gif\n\nFurther optimise and shrink\nIf you use imagemagick convert with a fuzz factor between 3% and 10% then you can dramatically reduce the image size\nconvert output.gif -fuzz 3% -layers Optimize finalgif.gif\n\nFinally\nCombine some of these options to reduce to something manageable for Ask Ubuntu.\nffmpeg -i Untitled_Screencast.webm -loop_output 0 -r 5 -s 320x200 -pix_fmt rgb24 out.gif\n\nFollowed by\nconvert output.gif -fuzz 8% -layers Optimize finalgif.gif\n\nExample\n\n\nA: Peek\nIs a new application that lets you easily record GIF's from your screen.\n\nAnyway, keep in mind that GIF's have a very limited color palette so it's not a very good idea to use them.\nSince Ubuntu 18.10 you can install Peek directly.\nsudo apt install peek\n\nFor older versions of Ubuntu, you can install the latest versions of Peek from its PPA.\nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:peek-developers/stable\nsudo apt update\nsudo apt install peek\n\nFind more information in the GitHub repo.\n\nA: *\n\n*Install these 3 packages: imagemagick mplayer gtk-recordmydesktop\n\n*Run Desktop Recorder to capture a portion of the screen/application to use as the screencast\n\n*Download ogv2gif.sh from https://github.com/nicolas-raoul/ogv2gif\n\n*Run: ./ogv2gif.sh yourscreencast.ogv\n\n*The GIF file will be put in the same directory\n\n\n100% inspired from maniat1k's answer.\n\nA: Ok, so in order to also capture mouse clicks, the only thing I found was key-mon (via the README of screenkey):\n\n\n*\n\n*https://code.google.com/archive/p/key-mon https://github.com/critiqjo/key-mon\n\n*sudo apt-get install key-mon\nThen I:\n\n\n*\n\n*Start key-mon\n\n*Use xrectsel to get the screen coordinates put into a byzanz command\n\n*Run the byzanz command\n\n\n... and it looks sort of like this:\n\nNote that key-mon --visible_click would draw a circle around the mouse pointer upon mouse click - which I would prefer, but in Ubuntu 14.04.5 LTS this is somewhat broken, as this circle does not appear and disappear fast enough in order to correctly illustrate the clicks (i.e. mouse presses and releases).\n\nA: Silentcast\nSilentcast is another great GUI-based tool for creating animated .gif images. Its features include:\n\n*\n\n*4 recording modes:\n\n*\n\n*Entire screen\n\n\n*Inside window\n\n\n*Window with decoration\n\n\n*Custom selection\n\n\n\n\n*5 output formats:\n\n*\n\n*.gif\n\n\n*.mp4\n\n\n*.webm\n\n\n*.png (frames)\n\n\n*.mkv\n\n\n\n\n*No installation necessary (portable)\n\n\n*Custom working directory\n\n\n*Custom fps\nInstallation\nIf you want a regular installation and are running a supported version of Ubuntu you can install Silentcast by PPA:\nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:sethj/silentcast  \nsudo apt-get update  \nsudo apt-get install silentcast  \n\nIf you aren't running a supported version of Ubuntu (you should really upgrade!) you will need to download the latest version from the GitHub page and manually satisfy the dependencies (you can procure yad and ffmpeg from here and here respectively) or, if you are running a slightly more recent version such as 13.10 you could try downloading the .deb directly.\nIf you're using Gnome you might want to install the Topicons extension to make stopping Silentcast easier.\nUsage\nStart Silentcast from your desktop environment's gui or run the silentcast command in a terminal. Pick your settings and follow the on-screen prompts. When you're done recording you will be presented with a dialog for optimizing the final output by removing a certain number of frames.\nFor more in depth usage guidelines take a look at the README, either the online GitHub version or the local version stored in /usr/share/doc/silentcast with zless or your favourite editor.\n\nNotes:\nSilentcast is still in the development stage and although it is quite stable you might encounter some bugs. If you do please report them on the project's GitHub issues tracker. If you have trouble installing from the PPA and are running a supported version of Ubuntu leave a comment below or contact the maintainer (me) on Launchpad.\n\nA: If you want to get even fancier, you can use a more sophisticated method than animated gifs using HTMl5 canvas screencasting. The x11-canvas-screencast project will create an html5 canvas animated screen capture. \nYou may have seen some famous examples of this tech on the Sublime Text website. x11-canvas-screencast takes this method a step further by incorporating tracking of the mouse cursor. Here's a demo of what x11-canvas-screencast produces\nThe result is better than an animated gif since it's not limited to the number of colors it has and it takes less bandwidth.\n\nA: Byzanz\nBest software I ever found to record GIF screencasts is Byzanz.\nByzanz is great because it records directly to GIF, the quality and FPS is impressive while maintaining the size of the files to a minimal.\nInstallation\nByzanz is now available from the universe repository:\nsudo apt-get install byzanz\n\nUsage\nWhen it is installed you can run it in a terminal.\nThis is a small example I did just now with\nbyzanz-record --duration=15 --x=200 --y=300 --width=700 --height=400 out.gif\n\n\n\nA: First install this:\nsudo apt-get install imagemagick mplayer gtk-recordmydesktop\n\nthose are the required stuff, ImageMagick, MPlayer and Desktop Recorder.\nThen use Desktop Recorder to capture a portion of the screen/application to use as the screencast.  After the Desktop Recorder has saved the recording into an OGV video, MPlayer will be used to capture JPEG screenshots, saving them into the 'output' directory.\nOn a terminal:\nmplayer -ao null <video file name> -vo jpeg:outdir=output\n\nUse ImageMagick to convert the screenshots into an animated gifs.\nconvert output/* output.gif\n\nyou can optimize the screenshots this way:\nconvert output.gif -fuzz 10% -layers Optimize optimised.gif\n\n\nA: I recently created combined version of scripts already posted here.\nBasically, it allows you to record screen region, but with simple GUI.\nThanks for Rob W for providing those cool scripts\nHere's the code (or gist if you like):\n#!/bin/bash\n\n#Records selected screen region, with GUI\n\n#This is combined version of GIF recording scripts, that can be found here: https://askubuntu.com/questions/107726/how-to-create-animated-gif-images-of-a-screencast\n#Thanks to Rob W, and the other author (unmentioned), for creating this lovely scripts\n\n#I do not own any rights to code I didn't write\n#                                     ~Jacajack\n\nDELAY=5 #Delay before starting\nDEFDUR=10 #Default recording duration\nTIME=$(date +\"%Y-%m-%d_%H%M%S\") #Timestamp\nFOLDER=\"$HOME/Pictures/Byzanz\" #Default output directory\n\n#Sound notification to let one know when recording is about to start (and ends)\nbeep() {\n    paplay /usr/share/sounds/freedesktop/stereo/message-new-instant.oga &\n}\n\n#Custom recording duration as set by user\nUSERDUR=$(gdialog --title \"Duration?\" --inputbox \"Please enter the screencast duration in seconds\" 200 100 2>&1)\n\n#Duration and output file\nif [ $USERDUR -gt 0 ]; then\n    D=$USERDUR\nelse\n    D=$DEFDUR\nfi\n\n#Get coordinates using xrectsel from https://github.com/lolilolicon/xrectsel\nREGION=$(xrectsel \"--x=%x --y=%y --width=%w --height=%h\") || exit -1\n\nnotify-send \"GIFRecorder\" \"Recording duration set to $D seconds.

It's quite useful for creating GIF animations. The colours may be off in some cases, but the file size makes up for it. Example: 40 seconds, 3.7Mb.\nUsage\nSave one/all of the following two scripts in a folder within your $PATH. Here's an example on using the first script to make a screencast of a specific window.\n\n\n*\n\n*Run byzanz-record-window 30 -c output.gif\n\n*Go to the window (alt-tab) you want to capture. Click on it.\n\n*Wait 10 seconds (hard-coded in $DELAY), in which you prepare for recording.\n\n*After the beep (defined in the beep function), byzanz will start.\n\n*After 30 seconds (that's the meaning of 30 in step 1), byzanz ends. A beep will be broadcast again.\n\n\nI included the -c flag in byzanz-record-window to illustrate that any arguments to my shell script are appended to byzanz-record itself. The -c flag tells byzanz to also include the cursor in the screencast.\nSee man byzanz-record or byzanz-record --help for more details.\nbyzanz-record-window\n#!/bin/bash\n\n# Delay before starting\nDELAY=10\n\n# Sound notification to let one know when recording is about to start (and ends)\nbeep() {\n    paplay /usr/share/sounds/KDE-Im-Irc-Event.ogg &\n}\n\n# Duration and output file\nif [ $# -gt 0 ]; then\n    D=\"--duration=$@\"\nelse\n    echo Default recording duration 10s to /tmp/recorded.gif\n    D=\"--duration=10 /tmp/recorded.gif\"\nfi\nXWININFO=$(xwininfo)\nread X <<< $(awk -F: '/Absolute upper-left X/{print $2}' <<< \"$XWININFO\")\nread Y <<< $(awk -F: '/Absolute upper-left Y/{print $2}' <<< \"$XWININFO\")\nread W <<< $(awk -F: '/Width/{print $2}' <<< \"$XWININFO\")\nread H <<< $(awk -F: '/Height/{print $2}' <<< \"$XWININFO\")\n\necho Delaying $DELAY seconds.

The dashboard opens if you press the windows key (aka SUPER) or if you move the mouse to the upper left corner. If you close the last window of a workspace, but there are open windows on other workspaces, the dashboard opens automatically. The latter behaviour is annoying if you do not want to use the dashboard to open new windows or to change workspace. There are many ways to to both (Gnome do, Docky, keyboard shortcuts, clicking on something on the desktop, ...).\nEdit: There is a related Q&A, which was closed because the asked the same question for Mint: \nhttps://askubuntu.com/questions/101646/how-can-i-prevent-the-activity-view-for-opening-when-i-close-the-last-running-ap\n\nA: I just stumbled upon this (closed) question at stackoverflow (see also this Q&A). The information there enabled me to solve the question - 22 hours before my own bounty ends... :)\nNote that this is an ugly solution, because you have change 2 lines in the sources of GNOME shell. It would be better to convert it to an (easy usable) extension. The information given here might lay the basis for an extension, but I don't know exactly how to do this in an extension.\nBasically you have to uncomment the command overview.show() in the file /usr/share/gnome-shell/js/ui/main.js (and the if before).

It boots up well but Unity 3D doesn't work which means that there is no 3D-support.\nWhat should I do now?\nThanks for your help!\n\nA: I have seen the Lenovo W520 machines psychically. These provide options to choose between Optimus, Discrete and Integrated mode. Optimus mode still defaults to the Intel graphics card while keeping the Nvidia card on. Discrete just hides the Intel graphics card from the OS. If you wish to take advantage of the nVidia card, you still need Bumblebee for now, or use discrete video mode.\nIf you switch to the integrated card in BIOS you need to make sure that the nVidia GL libraries are not loaded, otherwise it'll result in broken 3D support. The easiest method is uninstalling the nvidia-current driver. Otherwise, if you want to keep the nvidia drivers (because you frequently switch between Optimus/Nvidia and integrated), a change is needed to control the libraries to be loaded:\nDisabling the nvidia libraries (forcing Mesa libraries)\nRun the below commands to configure the Mesa libraries as default.

(In reality, both are greatly lacking in polish.) However, when using fullscreen applications, I notice that the hot corners do not go away.\nThis is most notable in VirtualBox which I need to run to access windows programs for my job. The gnome-shell notification area covers up the bottom pixel of the entire UI, making the windows taskbar largely useless-- you go to click anything, then need to mouse up a tiny amount for windows to actually see the click. This behavior is particularly annoying. The [Windows] key also fails to be passed to the applications that listen to it, as gnome-shell captures it instead.\nI sort of wish I could use gnome-shell with unity's notifications instead, as that's my only real gripe with it. Otherwise, maybe it's a virtualbox issue. Is there a way to get virtualbox to play nice with the new shells? (This might affect Unity as well, I haven't tried it.)\n\nA: Egads, I've found a partial solution. \nIt seems that Virtualbox's Mouse Integration is causing these problems. Disabling Mouse Integration and fully capturing the mouse instead clears up the issues for that program. The issue still persists in Chrome for me however. (The virtualbox solution seems to be a cheat, as it disables the native pointer which is probably what gnome-shell is listening for.)\n", "Q: Will Ubuntu for Android be fully open source?

It's only after I booted up again this evening that I noticed things weren't where I expected them.\nThis is so annoying!  Does anybody know what happened and how I can fix this?\n\nA: Changing the time back to the current date and time is fairly easy. From the manpage:\ntouch {filename}\n\nYou can use wildcards.

It's like gedit allocates a pixel at the extreme right just to annoy me! I have to carefully position the cursor in the scroll area.  What is going on and how can I change this behavior?\n\nA: There is a documented bug about this.\nThree methods of dealing with it that I know of:\n\n\n*\n\n*Live without scrolling by page the way you would like to or are used to.\n\n*Workaround by using a different method of scrolling full pages (e.g. PgUp/PgDn keys, assigning some modifier key to make scrollwheel scrolling go by page, etc.)\n\n*Following some of the links and linked bugs in that page I found someone suggested using the xrandr program to fool the computer into stopping his mouse just short of the edge.

This will very likely not work. \n\n*Practically all source tarballs you download have a configure script you should run befire running make, was there one and did you?\n\n*Some googling tells me that the card is supported in ALSA, so compiling and installing manually should not be needed. \n\n*If you have working, but bad sound, some people seem to be happier after switching to OSS4 and doing away with PulseAudio. \n\n\nA: Shot in the dark, but if you created the 'Sound' directory, try to rename it to 'sound'. I could be way off here because I don't know anything about the package you're trying to build/install. My second guess would be that you may need some of the *-dev variants of some packages, which often have the header files needed to build against.\n", "Q: How can I specify the default image viewer in mailcap?

This drive can be a CD, a DVD, a USB or an SD card. Be aware that any data stored on the drive you choose will be erased.\nYou will have to provide your root password during the installation, in order to give the installer the necessary permissions required to write a boot-loader onto the drive.\nYou can also choose to create a persistence file, which will allow you to save settings between sessions.\n\nHOWTO: Create a bootable USB-drive in Windows\nThere are a number of tools available in Windows to create bootable media, but my personal favorite is UNetbootin. It's pretty straightforward, and it can even download the appropriate Live CD image for you.\n\nOnce you have successfully created a bootable USB-drive, plug it into the computer you wish to install Ubuntu on and (re-)start it. On the Asus EeePC line of computers, you can enter the boot-menu by pressing the Esc-key when you start the computer. Which exact key is used for this differs between brands.\nThat should be all you need to do to create and boot into a Live USB session on a computer without an optical drive.\n\nA: To boot from USB on the Eee, press Esc at the BIOS screen to get the boot prompt.\nIf you are having problems using the image on the usb stick, you'll want to check the .iso you downloaded is complete by checking the md5sum (see here https://help.ubuntu.com/community/HowToMD5SUM).\n\nA: I install OSes on my Eee PC using an external cd/dvd drive (usbconnection).\nI have never installed an OS from a pen drive but here is the process:\nFirst insert the bootable pen drive to you Eee PC (Essential, make sure you do it before booting, otherwise it won't appear on the bios settings).\nNow enter the Bios setup by pressing Del (or F2 depending on your BIOS)\nNavigate to Boot device priority and make \"USB Devices/External Device\" your primary boot device.\nSave and Exit.\nReboot.\nHappy hacking !!\n", "Q: Plymouth splash not showing, purple and black on boot I've got Ubuntu 11.10 on Asus machine with Nvidia G-Force 210M,...everything works fine, but bootscreen Plymouth splash does not show...  \nFirst time I've had big resolution logo so I Googled some info about that problem and tried some things> plymouth fix, editing /etc/default/grub changing setup at startup manager...but it did not work...now i only have a purple screen for a while, then a black screen and then the system starts...  \nCan you help me figure out how to get the Plymouth splash working? thanx..\n\nA: Try Super Burg Manager:\n‘Super Boot Manager’ eases BURG, GRUB, Plymouth tweaking pains\n", "Q: dvd movies not mounting ok my problem here is that if I insert a dvd movie into my drive it spins then nothing happens, however if i insert a data dvd it mounts and opens the files within 20 seconds.

OSX allows user to add custom keyboard shortcuts for menu items. For instance you can define a custom keyboard shortcut for \"Copy\" and it will work for every application that has a menu item called Copy.\nIs there a way to do this for GTK and/or KDE applications?\n\nA: There is an obscure setting that is for this. XFCE has it in the GUI, but Gnome/Unity does not. The feature is an obscure one that's turned off by default, and perhaps because so few people use it, it doesn't always work very well.\nBut give it a try anyway. You'll need to install gconf-editor, if you haven't already:\nsudo apt-get install gconf-editor\n\nIf you go into gconf-editor and do a search (ctrl+f) for \"can_change_accels\".

When the menu item you want to bind a shortcut key to is hovered over, type the shortcut. It should appear immediately.\nThere are some caveats. One is, I'm not sure this works with Unity's global menu bar. Since I don't use Unity, I can't test and make sure. Another caveat is that non-native Gnome apps probably won't do this.

(KDE component: KWin, action: Show desktop)\n\n*There is no global shortcut for it, but you can set one. Note that the file browser on KDE is named Dolphin. See this answer on setting shortcuts for applications.\n\n*Ctrl + Alt + L locks the screen.\n\n\nThe default shortcut to get the Run dialog is Alt + F2. This can be mapped to Super + R as well. (KDE component: Run command, action: \"Run command\")\nThe global shortcuts can be controlled to the Global shortcuts configuration module. Open the Applications menu and search for Global shortcuts.\n\nA: There are several ways to create mapping keyboard shortcuts.\nIn system and settings you'll see an option for this (It may be labeled under \"Shortcuts and gestures\" or something like this -I'm not using an English version so titles may differ a little). \nIn order to assign shortcuts to task manager or to any widget that may be placed in any panel or desktop you can right click on it (or ALT+D, S) and then select properties option in the resulting menu. After that you will be able to assign a combination of keys that will launch that widget.\nFinally if you want to assign a shortcut to a certain program you can always edit the kmenu and then select the desired menu item and assign a shortcut under the advanced tab.\n\nA: Under any KDE 4 +\nThere is an application called System Settings.\nYou'll find a section called \"Shortcuts and Gestures\". You will find every action possible there and will be able to assign any keyboard to any gesture and even create your own ones.\nDon't be afraid of it, it's really easy to use and you can set \"main shortcuts\" and \"alternate shortcuts\" so you don't even have to remove the original one :)\n\nA: for (2), I wanted to kick away the default key binding for the 'system activity' so it won't be Control+Escape. Unfortunately, on my Ubuntu 12.04.3 I couldn't edit this shortcut anywhere in the system settings menus, and I searched well there. \nSolution: \nEdit ~/.kde/share/config/kglobalshortcutsrc \nSearch there fore 'ystem' and find the line like this:\nShow System Activity=Ctrl+Esc,Ctrl+Esc,Show System Activity\n\nSimply change it to your liking. In my case:\nShow System Activity=Ctrl+Alt+Esc,Ctrl+Esc,Show System Activity\n\nThat did the trick for me :-)\n", "Q: How to make others access my computer via Internet?

Specifically, I want to get the Ubuntu Server to tell the QNAP to shut down when there is no power, send an email to my gmail, and shutdown.\n\nA: The usual package used to monitor a UPS is Network UPS Tools, which is packaged in Ubuntu as nut.  Your model is listed as supported through the usbhid-ups driver on their website.\nAmong other features, NUT includes a client/server architecture that lets one machine make the UPS status available over the network.  This is useful in cases where you have a single UPS powering multiple machines, as in your situation.\n\nA: Here's the commands I used to setup nut for my Eaton 3s 700VA UPS on Ubuntu 12.04.\nsudo apt-get install nut\n\nsudo vim /etc/nut/ups.conf\n    [Eaton3S]\n    driver=usbhid-ups\n    port=auto\n\nsudo vim /etc/nut/upsd.users\n    [upsmon]\n    password = pass\n    upsmon master\n\nsudo vim /etc/nut/upsmon.conf\n    MONITOR Eaton3S@localhost 1 upsmon pass master\n\nsudo vim /etc/nut/nut.conf\n    MODE=standalone\n\nsudo service nut start\n\nsudo upsc Eaton3S\n\nTo have the modem shutdown and and have an email sent to yourself you'll need to write a bash script and edit SHUTDOWNCMD \"/sbin/shutdown -h +0\" in /etc/nut/upsmon.conf\n", "Q: How do I run Maven 2?

I want to remove all plugins from Firefox, until now I have only had success with removing all addons.

The default ones are in /usr/lib/mozilla/plugins, so you can try renaming them. On the other hand, you could also searching through the installed packages and uninstalling the plugins one by one.\n\nA: You don't need to remove your plugins in Firefox to make it faster. I suppose that is the reason you need plugins removed. \nYou can either disable all plugins by going to Firefox menu in Tools - Addons - Plugins, and choose manually for each plugin to 'Never Activate' or you can choose 'Ask to Activate' instead for one or more of your plugins if you think you want to use them in the future.\nYou can also try this package called G-Alternatives which will allow you to change or completely remove certain plugins for Firefox like Flash player or Java. The package can be installed through the Software Center, but if you want to download and install right from the link I gave you don't forget to first choose your Ubuntu version (eg. 13.10 , 12.04 ....).

It is essentially an editor wherein the child can drag and paste eyes, ears etc onto the picture of a guy shaped as a potato. The game can also spell out the names of the objects that we drag and place on the screen. It will speak in the language that you choose. This will help you to develop your vocabulary in any foreign language. In addition to the potato guy, you can create other themes like building a town.

Although the game is being developed further, it is already very much playable.\nFrozen bubble\n\nFrozen bubble\nIn this game, you shoot balls into another set of balls and when the adjacent shot balls are of the same color, they fall and you score. You win when the top wall is devoid of balls. This is a game of speed because if you do not hurry, the top wall will automatically push the balls down which then strike the launcher and you lose.\nlook here also \n", "Q: Enable web Search in gnome-shell Unfortunately i disable gnome-shell web search option with the following command\ngsettings set org.gnome.shell disabled-open-search-providers \"['google.xml', 'wikipedia.xml']\"\n\nHow to re-enable it?\nAlso how can i change the default search.

Additionally, as the stable release ages, the developers tend to start recommending users to try the nightly builds instead.\nTo add one of these to your sources, simply run:\nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:stebbins/handbrake-releases\n\nor\nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:stebbins/handbrake-git-snapshots\n\ndepending on which you want. To install HandBrake with the GUI, run:\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get install handbrake\n\nAlternatively, if you would prefer the CLI (command-line interface) over the GUI, replace the last line with:\nsudo apt-get install handbrake-cli\n\n\nA: HandBrake is available in the Ubuntu Software Center, search for it\n\nIf you have not made any changes to your Software Sources, you should be directed to an install page instead of what is in the above image.

For example, upgrading from 2.6/2.7 to 3.1/3.2. Since there are several questions relating to problems because of this, or a necessary to do this I thought it would just help in concentrating the benefits and problems associated with upgrading Python to a new/older release.\n\nA: The main reason you'd want to install Python 3.x is to run Python 3 programs.  With that said, you would still need Python 2.x installed if you wanted to run programs designed for that language since there are incompatibilities between the two.\nAs far as picking a single default Python interpreter for the base install (with the other needing to be installed afterwards if needed), the main reason you might want to pick 3.x is that this is where the language evolution takes place.\nAs has been announced, there won't be a Python 2.8 so any useful language extensions added to the 3.x branch of the language are not going to be back-ported to the old language.\nPrograms depending on Python 2.x are not going to go away any time soon, but the code in the default install is a much more manageable quantity.  So switching over should be possible in a much shorter time frame.\n", "Q: Ubuntu 11.10 doesn't see partitions I have some problem.

Uninstallation won't make you lose your configuration nor your files. Once apt-get -f install has finished, you will be able to install boxee again using:\napt-get update && apt-get install boxee\n\nIf this last command shows errors, then it'd be better to get in touch with the administrator of the archive from which you got boxee.

I have one bash source run.sh as follows,\n#!/bin/bash\nif [ $# -ne 1 ]; then\n    exit\nfi\n...\n\nwhen I execute it in two ways, there are different behaviors. The first way is,\nsource run.sh\n\nIt will close the terminal after execution. The second way is,\n./run.sh\n\nthis will simply finish running the script, and stay on the terminal. I am asking if there is a command for exiting a bash scripts for both source run.sh and ./run.sh execution. I have tried return too, which does not work well under ./run.sh execution.\nMore generally, I am interested in why this is happening, and what's difference between using \"source\" and \".\" for script execution?\n\nA: Three ways: \nYou can enclose the script in a function and only use return.\n#!/usr/bin/env bash\nmain() {\n    ...\n    return 1\n    ...\n}\nmain \"$@\"\n\nYou can test if the script is being sourced by an interactive shell.\nif [[ $- = *i* ]]; then\n    return 1\nelse\n    exit 1\nfi\n\nYou can try to return, and if it fails, exit.\nreturn 1 2>/dev/null || exit 1\n\n\nA: Think of the command 'source' as in 'include' statement.  It takes the content of the argument and runs it as though it were ran directly.  In this case your command is 'source' with an argument of 'run.sh' and run.sh is executed exactly as though you had typed the content of run.sh into your command line.\nWhen you run './run.sh', './run.sh' is your command and it has no arguments.  Since this file is plain-text and not binary, your shell looks for an interpreter at the shebang ('#!' on the first line) and finds '/bin/bash'.  So your shell then starts a new instance of bash and the content of run.sh is run inside this new instance.\nIn the first instance, when bash reaches the 'exit' command it is executed exactly as though you had typed it into the command line.  In the second instances it is executed in bash process your shell started, thus only this instance of bash receives an 'exit' command.\nWhen you type a line into bash, anything before the first space is treated as a command and anything that follows are treated as arguments.  The command '.' is an alias of 'source'.  When you run '. run.sh' the '.' is a command on it's own as it is separated from it's arguments by a space.  When you run './run.sh' your command is './run.sh' and '.' is part of the relative path to run.sh with the '.' representing your current folder.\n\nA: Before answering, I think some clarifications are needed. Let's analyze the following three lines:\nsource run.sh\n. run.sh\n./run.sh\n\nThe first two lines are exactly identical: . is in fact an alias for source. What source does is executing the shell script in the current context, hence a call to exit will quit the shell.\nThe third line (which is the one that confuses you) has however nothing to do with the other lines. ./run.sh is just a path, and is the same as (for example) /home/user/run.sh or /usr/bin/something. Always remember that commands in the shell are separated by a space. So, in this case, the command is not ., but is ./run.sh: this means that a sub-shell will be executed and that the exit will have effect just to the sub-shell.\n", "Q: How do I fix these package dependency issues?

The problem is that after doing all of that, the new CD still showed \"Unknown\" for the all of the songs, artist and album.  I am using Ubuntu 11.04.\n\nA: This is the expected result.\nWhen you insert a CD, Banshee tries to get track information from a number of online sources (e.g. MusicBrainz). If it can't identify your CD, you get \"Unknown\" instead.\nAdding the track information within Banshee will not make a difference, because you have not changed the online databases. If the CD is not an officially produced CD, then there's nothing you can do about this. However if it is a published CD, you can add the metadata to MusicBrainz. One way to do this is to install Sound Juicer Audio CD Extractor from the Software Centre and following the instructions.\n\n", "Q: How to add shortcut to unity launcher programmatically? I'm developing a program in Qt that will help users to manage (create, edit and delete) their quicklists in Unity launcher.\nI got to a point where I created .desktop file and I don't know how to programmatically place that file on Unity launcher. \nI found two (bad) ways to do this:\n\n\n*\n\n*Manually drag and drop created .desktop file to unity launcher\n\n*Edit favorites key with \"gsettings set com.canonical.Unity.Launcher favorites\" and force unity to reload with \"unity --replace\" \n\n\nSo, I'm searching for a function or a system command that is called on first 'drag and drop' method so I can do it in my program without need for user to do it manually.\nI don't even know where (or how) to search for my solution so any suggestions will be helpfull.\n\nA: You can add dynamic quicklists at runtime by using DbusMenu. You can read more about that here: https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Unity/LauncherAPI. That page also describes adding counters, progressbars and setting urgency. \n\nA: I would do it this way:\n\n\n*\n\n*Drop the .desktop file in ~/.local/share/applications. This way it will appear in the application section as well.\n\n*Fetch the list of favorites with gsettings get ....\n\n*Insert the path to the desktop file in the array using gsettings set.\n\n\nThe dbus idea by Jo seems nicer though. :)\n", "Q: Restore VLC 1.x functionality after installing VLC 2.x For several users, installing VLC 2.0 from it's PPA will result in multiple problems with the system, including but not limited to:\n\n\n*\n\n*Openshot not working\n\n*DeVeDe not working\n\n*Pitivi not working\n\n*Sound problems\n\n*Similar video tools having problems\n\n\nHow to fix this?\n\nA: The answer is to go back to 1.x since several libraries/tools are shared between other programs that VLC uses.\nTo solve this first:\n\n*\n\n*Remove the PPA from VLC 2.X from your Software Sources\n\n\n*Run this in the terminal so it removes any trace of VLC 2.X:\nsudo apt-get purge vlc libvlc5 libvlccore5 vlc-data vlc-nox vlc-plugin-notify vlc-plugin-pulse\n\n\n*Update Repositories: sudo apt-get update\n\n\n*Install VLC 1.x: sudo apt-get install vlc\nI'm sorry that I had to Ask and Answer this but do to some help about this with several friends and users here I thought it would be better to put it right now than wait.

Not much time after I installed my ubuntu, I installed ubuntu tweak and added shortcut keys for the applications I used most.\n\nHowever, I wanted to remove a shortcut key and was not able to (the last one). At least, I couldn't figure out a way to do that. I want to reconfigure them using ubuntu's keyboard tool, so I don't mind if I have to delete all shortcut keys from ubuntu tweak. Does anyone know how to do that?\n\nA: \nDouble-click the command to display the window shown.\nThen press ESC i.e. the escape key and the key will be removed that is displayed as disabled\nThat just leaves the Command itself.  Double click the Command to edit and type None.  Press Enter and the Command will be removed.\n\nA: If using Escape doesn't work, follow most of the steps by fossfreedom but when you get to the part where you would press Escape, instead press Backspace and that should delete the command/key binding.\nKeep in mind though, when you move to the keyboard shortcut system that Ubuntu provides by default, you will not be allowed to use the \"Super\" key in your shortcut...for some reason it is disabled there. You can apply it as a shortcut but the shortcut will never work unless used via Ubuntu Tweak or CCSM (Compiz).\n\nA: The \"Mod2\" key that keep turn ON is actually the Num Lock key (...), as ridiculous as it may seems.\nTurn Num Lock off, then press Backspace.  The shortcut will (finally) be deleted.

You usually want users to be able to change their password, and to do it regularly. Also, the passwd command isn't the only way a user can change their own password...\n\nA: With sudo you most certainly know that the default setup will require the user running sudo to enter a password (by default the password of the user running sudo and not the root password).\nIn Ubuntu, if you wish to remove a user from the admin group, run this command in a terminal:\ngpasswd -d username admin\n\nCheck it out:\nid -Gn username\n\nYou should see something like that:\nusername adm dialout cdrom plugdev lpadmin sambashare\n\nwithout the admin privilege.\n", "Q: Why don't Etron USB 3.0 controllers/ports work?

Running Ubuntu you will not get M/B raid support, (out of the box) USB3, or SSD shadowing of highly used sectors. (Intel Smart Response).\nI can understand not including a raid controller, but USB3 should just work.

I have a reasonable sized music collection that I keep in FLAC format on my Ubuntu laptop. I'd like to start playing this music on my Mac, and to sync it from there to my iPod.

This version uses the -n flag for avconv, so it will not overwrite any already-existing ALAC files, and using && instead of ; means that if avconv stops with an error then the original FLAC file will not be deleted:\nfor f in ./*.flac; do avconv -n -i \"$f\" -c:a alac \"${f%.*}.m4a\" && rm \"$f\"; done\n\nNote that deleting files with rm is irreversible (outside of forensic data recovery), so be careful using it.\n", "Q: Download and install proprietary wireless driver I successfully installed 10.04 LTS on my Dell Mini 9, but could not wirelessly access the internet, so I went to \"Hardware Drivers\" but there were no proprietary drivers listed.\nThis surprised me, because when I ran 11.10 off a USB drive, I could install the driver and get wireless internet access.

Thank you very much for your help!\n\nA: Probably this is late:\nHowever you have 2 options:\n\n\n*\n\n*Upgrade your Ubuntu to the latest version as you said, which will fix the problem.\n\n\nor\n2.You can go to the driver's website and download the driver (windows version). Using an application called \"Ndiswrapper\" in Linux. you can make the driver that was built for windows work in Ubuntu.\nHere is the full \"HOW TO\" for the second step:\nhttps://help.ubuntu.com/community/WifiDocs/Driver/Ndiswrapper\n", "Q: How do I add a new VSFTPD user?

For example, how to add a \"Startup Applications Preferences\" launcher to this Window?\n\n\nA: 11.10\nRight now adding custom items to System Settings is not support upstream from GNOME\nUbuntu patches System Settings gnome-control-center so that it can include it's own ubuntu specific entries in it.\nLong story short, you need to install libgnome-control-center-dev and create a wrapper around your application which is built against gnome-control-center package using libgnome-control-center-dev for pkg-config\nRight now there is no GUI method to add it.

I also think we tried that with GNOME 2 and failed.

If the file permissions require root access, that is what you will have to do. On the other hand, if the file permissions do not require root authority to write them, you can just run, e.g., \"gedit\".\n", "Q: How do you make the keyboard brightness button adjust at smaller intervals? \nPossible Duplicate:\nHow to increase brightness in smaller steps? \n\nI have a Lenovo Thinkpad T60 running Oneiric. According to the files in /sys/class/backlight, I should be able to adjust the brightness level to a number between 0 and 7 (and I am able to do this successfully in terminal using\necho 4 > /sys/class/backlight/acpi_video0/brightness\n\n). However, when using the keyboard button (Fn+Home, Fn+End), the brightness levels adjust by increments of three. For example, if the brightness is all the way up at 7 and I press the button once, it lowers to 4, then again to 1, then 0. I would like to change this so that it changes in increments of 1. E.g. It starts at 7, lowers to 6, then 5, and so on. Ideas?\n\nA: I'm not sure about those numbers, but on my HP laptop I used xbacklight to change my brightness. The brightness varies between 0 and 100 and pressing the brightness up/down keys changes the brightness by 10. I wanted something like five, so I mapped a key to the command\nxbacklight -inc 5\n\nand\nxbacklight -dec 5\n\nYou might be able to use this as a workaround to your problem.\n", "Q: Root filesystem randomly remounts itself as readonly after a few hours (Fresh install 11.10) The root filesystem itself randomly read-only (usually about 3-4hrs after reboot) and needs to be restarted to be able to work again.

Is there any way to do this? If I disable CCSM > Grid then I can stretch the terminal, but the results are less than ideal, observe:\n\nIs there a way to fix the --I don't know what to call it exactly-- Z buffer problem at the top? If not, could someone point me in the direction of the source code so I could try to reverse engineer it to allow for dual monitor full screen mode?\n\nA: This sounds like a bug and you should report the bug.\nAt first glance it looks like a design bug, something somewhere should allow you to make a window go over multiple monitors. Like F11 does for a single one.\nBut the second point is the corruption. Which looks very much like an error which should be fixed.\n\nA: If both screens are the same size then you shouldn't have a problem but I can't really think of another way and I also have the same problem I just use Jupiter for only my big monitor.\nsudo apt-get install jupiter\n\n\nA: How is your math and your knowledge of XServer's xorg.conf?\nYou have to have both displays set at the same screen resolution, set up 2 separate distinct monitor sections. Then you create a virtual console screen that is the size of the two added together, then place the position of each monitor within that virtual console... Several ways to do that in xorg.conf, with one Device's GPU (having multiple outputs) or with multiple GPU's (seperate cards). \nOne example is, you have two monitors siting side-by-side. Each is set to 1024x768. You create a virtual console screen of 2048x768. You place the first monitor at 0,0. You place the other Monitor at 0,1025 or just \"RightOf\"\nSection \"Monitor\"\n  Identifier     \"Monitor0\"\n  Option         \"Primary\"      \"False\"\nEndSection\n\nSection \"Monitor\"\n  Identifier     \"Monitor1\"\n  Option         \"RightOf\"      \"Monitor0\" \n  Option         \"Primary\"      \"False\"\n  Option         \"PreferedMode\" \"1024x768\"\nEndSection\n\nSection \"Device\"\n  Identifier     \"Card\"\n  Driver         \"vesa\"\n  Option         \"Monitor-DVI-I-0\"  \"Monitor0\" \n  Option         \"Monitor-DVI-I-1\"  \"Monitor1\" \nEndSectionEndSection\n\nSection \"Screen\"\n  Identifier          \"Screen0\"\n  Device              \"Card\"\n  Monitor             \"Monitor0\"\n  DefaultDepth        24\n  SubSection \"Display\"\n    Modes            \"1024x768\"\n    Virtual          2048 768 \n  EndSubSection\nEndSection\n\nThere is more detail than that and many alternate ways to separate it out to specific points/positons and devices, that also vary depending on your hardware... Some cards require that you split out the screen section and put it back together in a server layout section. But this is \"close\" as a summarized answer without knowing what you specifically are working with.\n", "Q: Restoring the Ubuntu desktop and access to files I recently got in way over my head playing with Ubuntu 8.04 on a Dell Mini 910.  I think I deleted far more things than I should have trying to \"make space\".  I started finding the applications I wanted by searching the main files.  Then I selected \"change desktop\" and really messed things up.  Now when the computer boots up I only see the desktop background with nothing else, no icons, no keys do anything.

You want to try another window manager like KDE. So you can install Kubuntu, it comes with KDE.\nTo install Kubuntu, open a terminal and run:\nsudo apt-get install kubuntu-desktop\n\nDuring the installation, you will be asking about which display manager you want to leave as default.

It will not load \nPossible Duplicate:\nHow do I reset my Unity configuration? \n\nI have an Acer Aspire 5733Z-4851 laptop running Ubuntu 11.10.  \nI install CCSM back when I installed Ubuntu on the system.  One day I was playing around with the different settings, when it seemed like the system locked up.  \nAfter restart of the computer; when trying to log into Unity 3D, the only thing that comes up after the desktop pattern is the menu bar that is normally hidden when Unity starts up.  \nIt stays up, but the panel on the left hand side never comes up, nor do the icons at the top right of the menu bar.  \nThe only way to shut the system down, or restart is to press the power button and bring up the menu.\nI will note that Unity 2D boots up perfectly fine.  I have tried to repair broken packages, but there does not seem to be any.  I have tried both synaptic and recovery console.  I just managed to get through a major update, that updated the kernal, and Unity.  This did not fix the issue.  I have also since removed CCSM hoping that would resolve the issue.\nI imagine that when I upgrade the machine to 12.04 that it would fix the issue, since when that happens basically the entire system would be replaced. \nDo any of you have any other things I can try to get the 3d environment working correctly again?\n\nA: So, you were messing with CCSM and Unity 2D works.\nWell, one of the most common mistakes is to disable the Unity plugin in ccsm.\nFrom the Unity 2D you can configure ccsm and enable that plugin again.\nOr you can simply try to run the command\nunity --reset \n\n", "Q: Problem using miniDisplay port adapter to VGA on Dell XPS l502x It's my first question here and I feel really bothered by this problem.

I had Windows 7 64 bit on dual boot (wubi) with Ubuntu 11.10 64 bit and it worked fine...\n\nA: Yes, it will not matter if you are installing the 32bit or the 64bit version.\nAs long as your computer supports 64bit instructions you can install any OS, 32 or 64bit as long as these play well with dual boot configurations.\nI recommend you do a md5sum check on the image you downloaded and on the burned CD to make sure there are no faults in it, or if that is an option try to create a USB pen using unetbootin and test it that way.\nIf you system worked with the Wubi install there is no reason why the LiveCD would not work, maybe its just failing to load due to BIOS configuration or bad media.\n", "Q: How to remove multiple network manager applets?

What does introspection mean exactly? How is it useful for a programmer? Can somebody please explain in layman terms?\n\nA: Introspection is a way of finding out what an object is and what it contains at runtime. In some languages this is more necessary than others. Python which is dynamically typed (that is to say, an object can gain attributes and methods at runtime) uses introspection to find out an object's current status.\nHere is a very simplistic Python example where you start with a class and add a new attribute, and, using introspection, monitor what attributes are available on the object instance.\n>>> class MyObject:\n...   variable = False\n\n>>> instance = MyObject()\n\n>>> dir(instance)\n['__doc__', '__module__', 'variable']\n\n>>> instance.newvariable = \"Kittens\"\n\n>>> dir(instance)\n['__doc__', '__module__', 'newvariable', 'variable']\n\nSo in dynamic systems you can use things like Python's hasattr to tell if an object will be able to do what you're trying to do with it. Even if you don't use it at runtime, introspection is also extremely useful for debugging.\n\nNow onto GObjects and GObject-based libraries. They're in C and in C you don't get all this lovely fluffy managed code nonsense, you get performance. This means built-in introspection isn't there and that means it's harder to maintain an external binding.\nBindings are an API between things in different languages that allow them to work together. In order for that to work you need a common API and in this case that API is GObject. But for this to work, the caller binding has to know what's available to it. Until GObject Introspection this has had to be hard-coded into the bindings and that means maintaining a hand-written list on each set of bindings.\nGObject Introspection essentially provides a scanner that can hunt through the current source of the GObject you're working with and provides you with XML binding information. This is then processed by the bindings and you end up with an API that just works, all the time.\nI certainly haven't covered everything here but I'm trying to give you an idea of the two topics (introspection and why GObjects need it). If you want to know more, there's plenty on the Gnome website.\n\n\n*\n\n*http://blogs.gnome.org/johan/2008/06/01/introduction-to-gobject-introspection/ (Good intro)\n\n*https://live.gnome.org/GObjectIntrospection/\n", "Q: Ubuntu mirror hosted on Akamai CDN?

If they know nothing, you may want to be cautious about connecting to the server.\nUsually what you do here is:\nssh-keygen -R server.name\n\nto remove the old entry.

How do I check whether a given file, such as an audio file, is DRM protected or not?\n\nA: Audio DRM is mostly format specific in that most DRM-capable formats are readily identifiable by their container which is usually reflected in their extension. This is to let the player know what it's dealing with, without having to analyse the file. A common example is an AAC file that you might buy from iTunes. If it's protected with FairPlay DRM the file is named as .m3p (vs the unprotected .m4a).\nThere's nothing to stop companies encrypting a .mp3 and leaving the extension the same - it's just going to annoy users when they switch to one of the billion available MP3 players and it doesn't work.\nFor video things can be a little more complicated. Some video container formats support DRM so their extension doesn't neccessarily change. I'd suggest trying to get ffmpeg or themonospot to analyse each file.\nHere's a little bash function I've just written that can get the codecs from a file:\nfunction codec() {\n    ffmpeg -i \"$1\" 2>&1 | grep Stream | grep -Eo '(Audio|Video)\\: [^ ,]+'\n}\n\nIn action:\noli@bert:~/Desktop$ codec \"The Beatles - 01 - Back In The U.S.S.R.mp3\"\nAudio: mp3\n\nYou could trim that down even more but give it a shot on some known DRM-laden media and see what happens. It'll either explode or will tell you about the DRM.\nAnyway, once you know what to expect, you can batch that, or something like it to quickly tell you which files have DRM.\n\nA: To determine DRM on video, you can use ffmpeg -i <filename>\nE.g.

I understand that one of the RAID types (Do not know if it is RAID-0,1..6) improves performance by using 2 hard drives simultaneous. The 2 hard drives are identical. Same size and all. How can I set them up as RAID to improve performance on the Desktop Ubuntu (This is not a server but a home computer).\n\nA: To get both a read and write performance boost, you would want to use RAID0 (stripe) or LVM.  Basically, this allows multiple hard drives to seek and read and write at the same time.  Note that there's no redundancy in this case, as there's no data replicated across devices.\nIf you used a RAID1 (mirror), you'd get a performance improvement on reads (as the data you're looking for can be read from each disk), but writes are more expensive because you have to write to both disks.\nRAID5 and RAID6 provide some read advantages as data is striped, but are generally less performant due to high CPU requirements for calculating parity.\nHope that helps!\nEDIT: The RAID has to be supported by Your mainboard to do so. On most mainboards You get simple options in BIOS to set RAID and such stuff. Good idea would be to read carefully mainboard manual to avoid possible problems with incompatibile BIOS settings.\n", "Q: DNScrypt proxy not working I've installed DNScrypt proxy from https://github.com/opendns/dnscrypt-proxy/downloads and installed it under Ubuntu 11.10 x64. \nI started the proxy by\nsudo /usr/sbin/dnscrypt-proxy --daemonize\n\nsyslog states\ndnscrypt-proxy[2615]: dnscrypt-proxy is ready: proxying from [127.0.0.1] to [208.67.220.220]\n\nI set the dns to localhost and restart the connection by gui.\nBut the local dns can not be reached:\ndnscrypt-proxy[2615]: dnscrypt-proxy is ready: proxying from [127.0.0.1] to [208.67.220.220]\n\nnetstat\nPID/Program name\ntcp        0      0 127.0.0.1:53            0.0.0.0:*               LISTEN          2231/dnscrypt-proxy\n\nSomeone has an idea?\nThanks a lot!\n\nA: At least for Ubuntu 12.04 the issue is local DNS cache running on 127.0.0.1 (dnsmasq).

If someone can help that would be great. This is my first time writing Python and trying to compile it (so I am not sure if there are better alternatives).\n\nA: You don't actually compile it, but merely package it. Compiling is where you translate your source code into machine-readable object code in the native instruction set of your computer. So for example, you compile C code into an executable.\nPython isn't compiled, it's interpreted. But you can still execute them by prepending #!/usr/bin/env python to any script and marking it as executable.\nIn terms of packaging a Python application for distribution, it's a little more of a hassle than you'd hope, but there are official instructions from Ubuntu.\nAs an aside, if you're developing with Ubuntu Quickly, it has a command for packaging.\n\nA: Actually python supports packaging. You better look into distutils or setuptools for packaging your python package. I recommend python packaging to distro specific packaging as it will be usable in any distro. Also have a look at some projects which use these tools for packaging in pypi e.g Django. \n", "Q: Update manager history and rollback options?

I imagine I would add something like \n<keybind key=\"XF86ScreenSaver\">\n<action name=\"Execute\">\n<command>xscreensaver-command -lock</command>\n</action>\n</keybind>\n\nHowever, when I press Fn-F1, it opens the Lubuntu menu, as if I'd pressed the Super_L key. It also types the letter l if I have a terminal open. My desired shortcut xscreensaver-command -lock seems to be ignored. What's going on? Why isn't my shortcut working?\nI thought I could figure this out with xev, but the output of xev confuses me:\nFocusOut event, serial 41, synthetic NO, window 0x2000001,\nmode NotifyGrab, detail NotifyAncestor\n\nFocusIn event, serial 41, synthetic NO, window 0x2000001,\n    mode NotifyUngrab, detail NotifyAncestor\n\nKeymapNotify event, serial 41, synthetic NO, window 0x0,\n    keys:  0   0   0   0   0   64  0   0   0   0   0   0   0   0   0   0   \n           32  0   0   0   0   0   0   0   0   0   0   0   0   0   0   0   \n\nMappingNotify event, serial 41, synthetic NO, window 0x0,\n    request MappingKeyboard, first_keycode 8, count 248\n\nKeyPress event, serial 41, synthetic NO, window 0x2000001,\n    root 0xae, subw 0x0, time 16525549, (289,-138), root:(341,155),\n    state 0x40, keycode 160 (keysym 0x1008ff2d, XF86ScreenSaver), same_screen YES,\n    XLookupString gives 0 bytes: \n    XmbLookupString gives 0 bytes: \n    XFilterEvent returns: False\n\nKeyRelease event, serial 41, synthetic NO, window 0x2000001,\n    root 0xae, subw 0x0, time 16525550, (289,-138), root:(341,155),\n    state 0x40, keycode 160 (keysym 0x1008ff2d, XF86ScreenSaver), same_screen YES,\n    XLookupString gives 0 bytes: \n    XFilterEvent returns: False\n\nMappingNotify event, serial 42, synthetic NO, window 0x0,\n    request MappingKeyboard, first_keycode 8, count 248\n\nKeyRelease event, serial 42, synthetic NO, window 0x2000001,\n    root 0xae, subw 0x0, time 16525639, (289,-138), root:(341,155),\n    state 0x40, keycode 46 (keysym 0x6c, l), same_screen YES,\n    XLookupString gives 1 bytes: (6c) \"l\"\n    XFilterEvent returns: False\n\nKeyRelease event, serial 43, synthetic NO, window 0x2000001,\n    root 0xae, subw 0x0, time 16525646, (289,-138), root:(341,155),\n    state 0x40, keycode 133 (keysym 0xffeb, Super_L), same_screen YES,\n    XLookupString gives 0 bytes: \n    XFilterEvent returns: False\n\nIt looks like I'm getting keycode 160, which I think is XF86ScreenSaver, but it's also as if I've pressed the Super_L key and the l key. I think all this output comes from the one Fn-F1 keypress. This confuses me. How can I get Fn-F1 to lock the screen instead of opening the Lubuntu menu and typing the letter 'l'?\n\nA: You can accomplish this with the xbindkeys app.  Open a terminal window and type the following:\nsudo apt-get install xbindkeys\nOnce installed you want to create two files in your home directory called:\n.xbindkeysrc\nThis file will hold your configurations for your keybindings\n.xbindkeys.noauto\nThis will just be a blank file but when it exists it keeps the Xserver from starting xbindkeys at boot.  Although we want it to start at boot, we want to start it ourself through Startup Applications.  The reason for this is the Xserver starts it to early in the boot process which sometimes causes our configs that we put in our .xbindkeysrc file not to work.\n\nNow add the following lines to your .xbindkeysrc file\n\"xscreensaver-command -lock\"\nc:160\n\nSave the file\nNow create a little script to start xbindkeys that we'll put into our Startup Applications:\nOpen your favorite text editor and either copy and paste or type the following lines to it:\n#!/bin/bash\n\nsleep 10\n/usr/bin/xbindkeys &\n\nSave it in your home directory as xbstart.sh or whatever you want\nMake it executable\nchmod 755 xbstart.sh\nNow just add that script to your Startup Applications and Reboot.\n\nWhat happens is when you log in, xbindkeys gets invoked and reads your .xbindkeysrc file and runs in the background.  It constantly monitors your keystrokes and when keycode 160 is pressed it will trap it before the Xserver has a chance to causing it to run xscreensaver-command -lock instead of opening your menu.\n\nA: I added this \n<keybind key=\"C-A-L\">\n  <action name=\"Execute\">\n    <command>xscreensaver-command -lock</command>\n  </action>\n</keybind>\n\nso when I do Crt+Alt+L my screebscaver start... like @fossfreedom show me\nso I supouse you have to do something similar\n<keybind key=\"C-F1\">\n  <action name=\"Execute\">\n    <command>xscreensaver-command -lock</command>\n  </action>\n</keybind>\n\nbut first check if that keybind is not already used.\n... About the fn option that you wanted: I will quote wikipedia.\n\nUnlike other modifier keys such as Ctrl, Shift and AltGr, the\n  microcontroller inside the keyboard typically sends out a different\n  keycode depending on whether the Fn key is depressed. This allows the\n  keyboard to emulate a full-sized keyboard, so that specialised keymaps\n  do not need to be created; the operating system can use standard\n  keymaps designed for a full-sized keyboard. Because the operating\n  system has no notion of the Fn key, the key can not be remapped in\n  software, unlike all other standard keyboard keys.\n\n", "Q: \"Screen-Reader tool Orca\" and extendable/customizable functionality in Ubuntu?

Turning the volume slider up all the way doesn't give very loud sound. I've tried typing alsamixer in a terminal and turning up all the levels there to maximum, but the speakers are still fairly quiet. Is there a simple way to increase maximum volume in software? \nI understand that there are physical limits to the sound the laptop's speakers can produce, but I suspect my maximum volume is limited by software.\nEDIT:\nThis is exactly the type of solution I'm looking for. However, it doesn't work for me.

Simply install pavucontrol package and then play with volume levels through the settings menu of the regular volume control in the panel.\n\nA: I am not sure it answers your question, however, when the sound on my laptop is not loud enough I generally go into the sound properties (there is a speaker icon on the upper right corner) and slides the pre-amplification to a higher value (over 100%). It can be convenient but it remains pre-amp (as VLC does for example) so depending on the situation in can deteriorates the sound.\n\nA: Quick Volume Changes\nPageUp increases volume by 5.\nPageDown decreases volume by 5.\nEnd sets volume to 0.\nYou  can  also  control left & right levels for the current channel independently, as follows:\n   [Q | W | E ]  -- turn UP [ left | both | right ]\n\n   [Z | X | C ] -- turn DOWN [ left | both | right ]\n\nIf the currently selected mixer channel is not a stereo channel, then  all  UP  keys  will work like W, and all DOWN keys will work like X.\nThe number keys from 0 to 9 are to change the absolute volume quickly.

So I want to know which graphics card it will support.\n\nA: The Intel 945gcpe only takes PCI cards. That limits you because 15 years ago AGP replaced PCI for graphics and then PCI-E replaced AGP. PCI-E is not compatible with the PCI.\nOnly a handful of cards have been released for PCI in the past decade. The ATI Radeon 9000 or 9250 are about as shiny as you'll get for PCI but by modern standards, it's hard to consider either a good option. They're both between £25 and £30 new in the UK. To put some context to this, you can buy a Nvidia GT 430 (low end but modern) for £40. \nWhen you're looking at these prices, you should be weighing up the price of just buying a newer, second-hand, low-end computer. I don't think throwing money at the Intel 945gcpe is money well spent.\n\nA: In general, every card that has the proper slot - in common language - if the card fits it should work (assuming You have upgraded bios etc). \nIncompatibility issues are more common with processors and RAM memory. On the intel website there's no single word about problems with supporting graphic cards.\nHowever I recommend to search forums and so on, after You have chosen Your card. Before You buy try to google stuff like:\n intel 945gcpe Your VGA card name problem\n\nand see if something shows up.\nOther thing is that You should buy a card that is well supported by Ubuntu, or I'd rather should say - the vendor provides good linux drivers.\nRegards\n\nA: this is a link to your motherboards specifications:\n\nhttp://downloadmirror.intel.com/15114/eng/D945GCPE_SpecUpdate03.pdf\n\nThis specifies that the slots are PCI.\nGiven that these are the recommendations I would make:\nJATON VIDEO-498PCI-DLP GeForce 9500 GT 1GB 128-bit DDR2\nPNY VCG84512D3SPPB GeForce 8400 GS 512MB 64-bit DDR3\nEnsure you have a power supply that is capable of running these devices.\n\nA: only very old video cards (bellow 8MB memory) will fit into your motherboard.unless you get a pci video card for free or (almost free),it's not worth spending money or time on that motherboard since it won't be able to run anything above DSL or puppy linux satisfactorily.\n", "Q: Mount - Unable to find suitable address I am trying to mount my Windows share through my Ubuntu box (no xwindow), but I continue to get\n\nUnable to find suitable address\n\nI have tried using the raw IP address, I have checked the credentials, I have disabled the Windows firewall, but I cannot find anything wrong.\nbenny@backup:~$ sudo mount -t cifs //my-desk/j -o username=me,password=s)mePasss /mnt/sync\nUnable to find suitable address.\nbenny@backup:~$ ping my-desk\nPING my-desk (10.10.10.43) 56(84) bytes of data.\n♥\n--- my-desk ping statistics ---\n2 packets transmitted, 0 received, 100% packet loss, time 1008ms\n\nbenny@backup:~$ sudo mount -t cifs //10.10.10.43/j -o username=me,password=s)mePasss /mnt/sync\nUnable to find suitable address.\n\nAny help would be greatly appreciated!\n\nA: You might have to explicitly specify the IP address, e.g.:\nsudo mount -t cifs //my-disk/j -o \"username=me,password=s)mePasss,ip=10.10.10.43\" /mnt/sync\n\n", "Q: Move downloaded files based on criteria After downloading tv shows and movies I would like them to be automatically moved to two separate folders (named \"tv shows\" and \"Movies\"). \nI know there are a lot of programs that you can do this with on windows / osx but I am not sure about ubuntu.

This is the same one that Firefox is using.\nYou can also run locate libflash to have a quick look over the system for versions of Flash. /usr/lib/flashplugin-installer/libflashplayer.so is the only version I have on the computer (the others are symlinks).\nYou should note that later this year (assuming their plans turn out) Chrome/Chromium will switch to a PPAPI version of Flash (from the NPAPI one it shares with Firefox). So whatever instructions you do get, they'll stop working at some point this year... Unless Mozilla backtracks and decides to support PPAPI (which is also possible).\nI have had a look at the google-chrome-stable, -beta and -unstable packages and none of them have a Flash plugin in them.\n\nA: You cannot use the same flash library for both browsers.\nFlash is directly integrated into Chrome and all updates are automatic for it. If you wish to use flash on other browsers you need to install it separately from Adobe for Firefox.\nReference\n", "Q: Adobe Flash .sol location I've looked around the internet for a while and this forum/place and still can't find an answer.

Usually in Windows OSs they're located in the c:\\users\\documents & settings\\username\\appdata\\shared objects\\macromedia\\CODE\\here (or similar) but I've been looking around and can't find the location of the file.\nThe reason being is I want to move my flash game files from a Windows PC to my Ubuntu and play them. My only [temporary] solution is to get a Windows VM, but that's laggy as it's an old PC.\nAny solutions or answers are very welcome ^^\nEdit: Thanks i'll try the solutions soon.\n\nA: Try under ~/.macromedia/Flash_Player/#SharedObjects/CODE/here.\n\nA: You can try:\nlocate .sol\n\nWhich will list all the \".sol\" files on your system.\n", "Q: Ubuntu Installation on Toshiba Qosmio X770 I am trying to install the last Ubuntu version on my laptop but I could not make it because the installation process freeze and don't let me go on.

Also I cant install from wubi. It simply stops with a backend error. Any ideas...\n\nA: bcbc appears to have essentially answered the question in a comment:\n\nThe 'backend' error is a wubi bug, but it only occurs after the ISO is\n  rejected. So there is likely a problem with the DVD (which explains\n  why you can't boot from it) and perhaps the ISO (which might explain\n  why the USB stick fails as well)\n\n– bcbc Feb 28 '12 at 17:42\nSo the error only happens after Wubi looked at the files on the CD and found it not to be the right file. This is usually due a corrupted or damaged ISO or CD/DVD/USB, so:\n\n\n*\n\n*MD5 test the ISO image. If it's bad, download the ISO again (and MD5 test that one too).\n\n*If your DVD and USB flash drive were created from an ISO image with a valid MD5SUM:\n\n\n*\n\n*Make sure you are writing the USB flash drive and burning the DVD correctly. Try making them again. (You'll need a new DVD but you can use the same flash drive.)\n\n*Try burning the DVD at the slowest possible speed. This can sometimes reduce the risk of errors, or of physical damage to the DVD's surface if your DVD media are not entirely compatible with your DVD writer. (This applies to CD's too, to a degree.)\n\n*That should let you install a normal Ubuntu system, alongside (or in place of) your Windows system. I recommend that, as it performs a bit better and is considerably easier to fix if something goes wrong. However, if you prefer to use Wubi, you can install without having to prepare a CD/DVD or USB drive at all. Just make an empty folder, and put the ISO image and wubi.exe in the folder. (You can get wubi.exe here.) Then run wubi.exe.\n\n\n\nAlso please note that if you're able to boot an Ubuntu CD/DVD or USB flash drive, you can test the burn/write itself using this method (also explained here). This is highly advisable, especially if you've already experienced problems like you have.\n", "Q: installation of ubuntu 11.10 I have created several iso s from the ubuntu download page.I have made a couple 64 bits as well as 32.Everytime I burn this iso and install onto my computer I pretty much on ly get the option to run it beside windows.I am trying to get it to replace windows completely but that option isnt there.I have used infrarecorder and the other one it recommended on the site as well.When I put the cd in I have the option to run wubi installer or view files.When I open the view files tab it seems that all files are there I think.I ve tried this with cd and dvd to burn.Am I doing something wrong in the burn phase?I ve burned iso images before and they have always worked.\n\nA: There is nothing wrong with your \"burn phase\", you can't change the ISO content..so if on my installation I got the option to install Ubuntu o my entire HD, you'll have the same option...\n32 and 64 bits have a different installation setup but both, I have tested, offers a option to install side by side with other OS or install overwriting current OS and there is a red label giving some kind of alert.\nThere is no possible way your ISO is different then the rest of us, if you downloaded it from Ubuntu\n", "Q: I cant install gnome classic or the shell one sudo apt-get install gnome-shell Reading package lists...

I'm root and I can't write to the sudoers file in my mounted hd.\nI can't change the permission with chmod because system tell me it's a read-only file system.\nWhat should I do?\n\nA: Suppose you mounted your install Ubuntu system's root filesystem at /mnt on the transient live CD system, and that the partition is /dev/sda1.\nThen remount it readwrite:\nsudo mount -o rw,remount /dev/sda1 /mnt\n\n\n\n*\n\n*If that fails, unmount the filesystem (with umount) and fsck it to find and repair any errors (see also e2fsck).\n\n\nThen you can edit its sudoers file like this:\nsudo visudo -f /mnt/etc/sudoers\n\nActually, you can edit it as root using whatever mechanism you want. For example, to edit it in such a way as to allow you to introduce errors that break it and prevent sudo from working:\nsudo -e /mnt/etc/sudoers\n\nBut visudo is better because it won't save your changes to the file if they are syntactically wrong.\nBy using visudo when editing /etc/sudoers on your installed system (from the installed system), you avoid having to boot into recovery mode, or to a live CD, to fix it.\nsudo visudo\n\nIf you do break your sudoers file, you can fix it without booting into recovery mode or rebooting, because there is another mechanism besides sudo for becoming root:\npkexec visudo\n\npkexec is the command-line frontend to PolicyKit. It is generally not present on server systems without a GUI, but it will be present on virtually any Ubuntu system with a GUI (and you do not actually need the GUI to be working to use it, though if there is a GUI it will give you an authentication window rather than authenticating in the terminal itself).\n\nA: I figure out how to do it, recovery mode, exit from read only file, drop on the root sheel and now I have the write permission :D\n", "Q: Can Chromium Browser's Permissions Facilitate a Root Kit Exploit?

Yesterday I tried to use this heroku command:\nheroku run db:migrate\n\nand after a long wait it said that it was in timeout\nAfter many tries I've googled about this and I found that, since also other commands have given the same response, the problem was that my pc (or my net?) hasn't the port 5000 open.\nCan i open this? How in Ubuntu?\nIf it is releated to my providere I read somewhere that probably I can whitelist this port: can i do this from Ubuntu? How?\n\nA: You open a port with a program. The operating system provides primitives for you to do so, which is usually done at the OS level is to allow the port to accept connections. For this, you may need to configure the firewall or even SELinux, depending on your installation (even though I did not see Ubuntu standard installation bringing any of these). @ Andrea  pointed out that you do not need special permission to the program if it wants to open the port. Again, this is a program, a server, which will be listening on a port.\nAny network communication, using connection-oriented protocol (such as TCP / IP), needs a listening server port, and connecting client. I do not know Heroku, but I guess by the looks of the command that you posted, you are trying to migrate a database from one place to another. That depends if you open two connections, one to extract the data from and the other one to write into.\nIf you intend to receive connections from the Internet, then you need a port on a public IP, which arrives to the port 5000 of your server machine.\nIf you think you have a correct installation, then try this command: \nsudo netstat -tnlp \n\nIt should give you something like this output:\nActive Internet connections (only servers)\nProto Recv-Q Send-Q Local Address           Foreign Address         State       PID/Program name\ntcp        0      0 0.0.0.0:22              0.0.0.0:*               LISTEN      940/sshd   \n\nThis is the case, for a SSH server, listening on port 22. You should have something similar, for the 5000 port. \nIt that's the case, then try connecting from your internal network to the server's IP, and then figure out how to open it to Internet.\nYou can do this with the telnet command: \n$ telnet 192.168.1.1 22\nTrying 192.168.1.1...\nConnected to 192.168.1.1.\nEscape character is '^]'.\nSSH-2.0-OpenSSH_5.8p1 Debian-7ubuntu1\n^\\\nConnection closed by foreign host.\n\nIf you got the word \"Connected\" then your port is alive and kicking :)\nThis is a sample for a SSH server listening, your heroku output should be different.\n", "Q: How do I limit a Ubuntu machine to a Python GUI?

I know how to get the script to start on startup, but how do I prevent them from exiting out or opening other menus? Basically the sole purpose of this console is to run the time-clock GUI.\n\nA: I'd consider replacing the whole frontend with something like nodm. I've already covered the details for this in another answer.\nYou'd essentially start with Ubuntu Server, layer on a few packages and then create a ~/.xsession script to load your Python application. It's extremely lightweight and users can't mess around with anything else.\nIf the application crashes or the user finds a way to exit it, nodm will restart and will just load the app back up. Perfect for single-purpose machines.\n\nA: I'll give the same answer I gave on stackoverflow:\nYou can use wm_overrideredirect, then make the UI full screen. This will remove all window decorations so there's no way to close the window. If that's not enough, as a final step you can do a global grab. With that, you effectively control everything that they can do.\nBe very careful about coding global grabs -- make sure you can ssh into that box to kill the process, otherwise you can effectively denial-of-service your box.\n", "Q: nVidia GeForce 8500GT + Old Monitor = Low resolution So I've just installed Ubuntu 11.10 on my old PC.\nIt has an nVidia 8500GT, and the Desktop monitor is pretty old though; like 1998 old.

This solved the problem on me.\nExecute synclient -l to list all configurations.\n\nA: Any changes you make with synclient are lost after reboot. To make the solution posted by Cyron permanent, paste the synclient command(s) to a shell script and add the shell script to your Startup Applications in Unity. \nNote that the script has to start with #!/bin/bash, and that you may change permissions to executable to work properly.\n\nA: I was looking to solve this problem as well. I don't use a mouse; I use touchpad exclusively. My preferred code editor is vim and I was fed up with unintentional copy and pasting while touching the corners of my touchpad.

In the new unity there's no way of moving the indicators like in the older version. Is there even possible? If so, how?\n\nA: No, that's not possible. At least, not in an easy and user friendly way. It's actually never been possible. You're probably thinking of the Gnome Panel that was used by default in the past. It's a different program, and though they look similar, they're rather different. \nI understand your use case, and it might be nice to be able to reorganize the indicators. One thing that needs to be considered in this particular case, is that the weather indicator is an \"app\", whereas the message, network, sound and calendar (datetime) are all system indicators.

Importantly, they're opt in - if you need them, then you can install them, but if your hardware worked at 10.04 release we can be much more confident that your hardware will continue to work with the default (2.6.32) kernel than with linux-backports-*.\nFor Ubuntu 12.04 there are analogous nvidia-current-updates and fglrx-updates packages. We can update these without fear of breaking hardware that worked at release, and users who need them can opt-in.\nMajor driver updates - for example, from the 195 series drivers to 295 series drivers - carry serious risks of making things which currently work fail.  This is unacceptable for an LTS: people use the LTS precisely so they don't get breaking changes.  The nvidia-current-updates solution avoids this problem.\n\nA: Firstly, the Ubuntu Wiki, as is the case with almost any wiki, is edited and maintained by the community. It can easily become out of date, and if you find any outdated information, you are encouraged to suggest an edit.\nSecondly, the main issue with supporting the latest drivers on old releases is support for older kernels and versions of the X display manager. It becomes difficult to maintain compatibility as things get older, and eventually, the developers have to drop off support for some of the older software in order to introduce new features, seal off some bugs, and support newer APIs, etc. This is why you will find, that despite 10.04 being an LTS release, it does not always have the option to get the latest and \"greatest\" software and drivers. Fortunately, 12.04, the next LTS release, will allow you to run later versions of the NVidia drivers, so you can upgrade to it when it is available.\n\nA: on the 12.04 the support for nvidia-173 is not working, since it lacks the necessary ABI support. The nvidia-current driver does but not support the fx 5 series (mine is nvidia fx 5500), so good bye for the 3D-accel for now. grrrr\n(the manual installing of the drivers (the current or 173) isn't working as well, since the first one does not actually run on fx5500 and the second lacks th ABI support.)\nany help?\n\nA: why the LTS does not support the latest drivers...\nThe LTS is aimed to provide the a stable system for the largest range of people and systems.\nThus if you are looking for the latest - look at the next development release and/or install PPAs or compile your own code.  Potential instability should be expected - so this is not for the faint-hearted.\nGood news...\nDue to Canonical's focus now on bringing the latest games onto the 12.04 & newer releases, experimental packages are now available.\nThe key phrase is experimental - they are the latest (or almost latest) straight from the key graphics vendors.  They have been tested by those vendors and are to be released to beta testers.  Thus you need to carefully consider this if you are not confident to fix black-screen issues.\n\n*\n\n*My computer boots to a black screen, what options do I have to fix it?\nNvidia\nNewer - more experimental packages are to be made available to 12.04 and future releases.\nThese packages are tagged nvidia-experimental - at the time of writing, the package is nvidia-experimental-304.

Development is still relatively active but the future of the project seems bright.\nThe following extract shows the relationship between the latter two projects as they forked out of the first. You can read a lot more about the history on The Bumblebee Project's history page but you should note that it is written by the new Bumblebee maintainers. There is bad\n\nWe decided to rewrite the old MrMEEE/bumblebee codebase which contained some design flaws. We established a new development architecture, a managed organization and started to rewrite everything from scratch. During this process, we got rid of the online database. This allowed for a more secure, offline installation. MrMEEE decided not to take part in this project and instead removed support for distributions other than Ubuntu and continued with the name Ironhide. We continued with the name \"Bumblebee\", and use TBP/Bumblebee (TBP = The Bumblebee Project) to distinguish from the legacy MrMEEE/bumblebee project.\nUnfortunately, this led to the belief that Bumblebee was dead and that Ironhide is better or even \"deprecates\" TBP/Bumblebee. Although the configuration database is quite horrible (it downloads unconfirmed scripts which can contain even malicious or incomplete code), it sometimes just \"works\". The Bumblebee Project team decided not to enable such a feature by default because we are focused on stability and do not want to give users a bad experience. A lot issues on https://github.com/MrMEEE/ironhide/issues are a result of misconfiguration of ACPI calls.\n\nIf you listen to them, you want to be using the latest Bumblebee (TBP). If you listen to MrMEEE you probably want to be using TBP (for the moment until he can maintain his project again).\n\nA: Bumblebee just released a new version few days ago.\nFrom the Ironhide project page: \"I have given up on supporting the nvidia packages myself..\"\n", "Q: How can i change my maximum resolution on ubuntu 11.10? i have a 1080p monitor connected to my pc running ubuntu via a vga cable,however when i installed the amd drivers from the additional drivers programme,ubuntu seems to think that my monitors maximum resolution is 1600x1200.

Is there any way I can install version 1.8.10?\nI'm running 11.10, but would be interested in a general solution if possible.\n\nA: If you want to test out an old version of Cairo, you can build it in a temporary prefix in your home directory.\nFirst of all, make sure you've got Cairo's build dependencies installed.  You can do this with the following command:\nsudo apt-get build-dep cairo\n\nNow download and unpack the old version of Cairo:\nwget http://cairographics.org/releases/cairo-1.8.10.tar.gz\ntar xzf cairo-1.8.10.tar.gz\ncd cairo-1.8.10\n\nNow you want to build Cairo into a temporary prefix.  I've used ~/prefix for this on a few occasions, but you can use any directory.\n./configure --prefix=$HOME/prefix\nmake\nmake install\n\nNow you need to make your own software use this version of Cairo.  If the software uses pkg-config to locate its dependencies, it should only be necessary to set the following environment variable:\nexport PKG_CONFIG_PATH=$HOME/prefix/lib/pkgconfig\n\nIf it isn't using pkg-config, you might need to adjust CFLAGS to include -I$HOME/prefix/include and LDFLAGS to include -L$HOME/prefix/lib.\nFinally, to run your program using the custom version of Cairo you will need to configure the dynamic linker so it looks for shared libraries in your temporary prefix:\nexport LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$HOME/prefix/lib\n\nOnce that is set, you can verify that your program is linking against your copy of Cairo using ldd.  If that looks okay, you're all done.\nCleaning Up\nOnce you're done with this temporary install, cleaning up is pretty easy.  Just reset the environment variables and remove the temporary install prefix:\nunset LD_LIBRARY_PATH\nunset PKG_CONFIG_PATH\nrm -rf $HOME/prefix\n\nYou may need to reconfigure/rebuild your program after doing this to make it use the system Cairo again.\n", "Q: Slow server on web-based writes and SSH login I have an Ubuntu 10.04 server that's going a bit slow.

How can I set this up with iptables?

Unless you plan to monitor the logs you may wish to use an alternate method, such as snort (you can configure snort to alert you to certain traffic) or a http proxy (squid if you in a large organization).\nYou may want to limit your logs \nsudo iptables -I OUTPUT 1 ! -d 10.0.101.0/24 -m limit --limit 5/min -j LOG \n\nSee also https://help.ubuntu.com/community/IptablesHowTo\n", "Q: Regular installation from Wubi \nPossible Duplicate:\nHow to convert Wubi install into regular install? \n\nI have Ubuntu installed on my D drive using Wubi.

You can shrink either /dev/sda2 or /dev/sda3 to make space for Ubuntu. You can use the Windows 7 disk management console to do this (recommended) or GParted (I recommend that you have a Windows Repair CD handy in this case).\nThen you can create an extended partition in the free space, and - using GParted either from the Wubi install or a live CD - create two logical partitions, one as ext4 for Ubuntu and another as linux-swap for the swap partition. The swap partition must be > than the size of your RAM if you want to be able to hibernate. Refer to this guide for an indepth discussion of partitioning using GParted on a live CD.\nThen you can either migrate the Ubuntu install using the link Jorge Castro provided. There is a script that will do it automatically (my answer at that link) or you can do it manually as per the accepted answer.\n", "Q: Wireless Connection Freezes on a Macbook Pro (early 2010 model) with a BCM4322 I have a MacBook Pro (early 2010 model), and I've been having problems with the network connection periodically stopping.

I am simply wondering why the Ubuntu OS is not presented in big conferences at launches? \nI see other OS-es gaining a lot of market share by doing so. I think that Ubuntu even if it is free of charge could benefit from big presentation shows at launch like Windows or Apple's Mac OS.\n\nA: There are some community organized release parties and other events. Look here for upcoming events mainly organized by the LoCo Teams.\n\nA: While the points brought up by Jo-Erlend Schinstand largely stands, there is also the issue of not having enough monetary funds and other resources to promote Ubuntu for every release. Imagine conducting large publicity-oriented keynotes every six months. It will be definitely take quite a bit of resources to do it well. \nCompanies like Microsoft and Apple have a lot of money in their treasury that lets them spend considerable amount of resources in publicity while Canonical, unfortunately, doesn't. \nMoreover, publicizing releases that aren't fully bug free (honestly, no Ubuntu release has been 100% bug free) is doing more harm than good. It will create a very poor impression about Ubuntu and the rest of the Linux community. \nAlso note that our development cycle is very packed and there already isn't enough time to bring in all the planned features for every release. Hence, conducting presentations might also be a time consumer and will probably put enormous stress on an already tight schedule.\nSome relevant points of discussion in the #ubuntu-community-team IRC channel are pasted in this pastebin.\n\nA: When we say that Ubuntu is free, that is not meant as shorthand for \"free of charge\", but that you have freedom. The fact that it is also free of charge, is mostly a consequence of that freedom. That difference is very important. \nMicrosoft own its software and makes large sums of money from each user by selling limited licenses to use the software. They don't sell the software itself. So it can be considered a form of rental. This is of course highly lucrative, since customers can never stop purchasing upgrades as long as they want to use that platform. Apple owns most of theirs and makes most of its money selling hardware and their software can only be used on that hardware. So, the principle is similar. By getting customers dependent on the software, they're also making them dependent on the hardware, which of course, is rather expensive. Both companies have billions to spend on marketing – and have to do so, since they depend on sales. \nUbuntu, on the other hand, is developed by hundreds of companies and thousands of individuals who do so for very different reasons. Governments help develop it because they save money by doing so, while increasing security at the same time. Schools help develop it for many of the same reasons, but also because they don't want to make their students dependent on certain companies and expensive tools, whether it's hardware or software. When education makes a child intellectually dependent on Microsoft or Apple, a significant economic burden is allocated to that child. \nSo the situation is rather different. However, many companies will present their Ubuntu-related services at conferences and there are release parties all over the world. But since it isn't developed by a single entity, it wouldn't be right to present it the same way that Apple and Microsoft does. It might actually be somewhat destructive if other parts of the GNU/Linux community felt that Ubuntu took too much credit for other peoples work. It is a global \"co-opetition\" where competitors are also partners. RedHat and Oracle, for instance, both sells their Enterprise Linuxes and therefore creates a lot of good software. This software is also available in Ubuntu. The economic incentives are also not the same. Ubuntus main sponsor, Canonical, provides services to OEMs and large companies, and will present their services to them, but that's not very visible to the general public – not because it's secret, but because we simply have no reason to care. \nIt's not really comparable at all. Though the software as a product is very much comparable to those provided by Apple and Microsoft, the development process and community is radically different. Ubuntu is more comparable to the internet, which is also good because of developments from large numbers of separate entities. Who should present and promote the internet at conferences? Anyone and everyone. \n", "Q: Aptana unable to find java I am getting the following errors when i am running aptana\nA Java Runtime Environment (JRE) or Java Development Kit (JDK)\nmust be available in order to run AptanaStudio3.

However when there is speak about intel cards problems begin. Integrated intel cards usualy do not cooperate with PCI cards and so on. This forum is full of posts concerning this issue. So Combining Intel card with other card might be difficult or impossible. But... \nFirst of all, get into BIOS and check if Your mainboard allows to use two VGA cards at the same time. If Yes, set this option to allow to do so. Then boot to Ubuntu and see if it detects all VGA cards:\nlspci | grep VGA\n\nIt should give both used cards in the output. If so then try to configure monitors in system preferences. If You cannot set monitors via user preferences then try to create xorg.conf file and set it manually.

I wrote a python code for getting random text into a .txt file.\nNow I want to send this random text into notification area via 'notify-send' command.\nHow do we do that?\n\nA: We can always call notify-send as a subprocess, e.g like that:\n#!/usr/bin/env python\n#-*- coding: utf-8 -*-\n\nimport subprocess\n\ndef sendmessage(message):\n    subprocess.Popen(['notify-send', message])\n    return\n\nAlternatively we could also install python-notify2 or python3-notify2 and call the notification through that:\nimport notify2\n\ndef sendmessage(title, message):\n    notify2.init(\"Test\")\n    notice = notify2.Notification(title, message)\n    notice.show()\n    return\n\n\nA: To answer Mehul Mohan question as well as propose the shortest way to push a notification with title and message sections:\nimport os\nos.system('notify-send \"TITLE\" \"MESSAGE\"')\n\nPutting this in function might be a bit confusing due to quotes in quotes\nimport os\ndef message(title, message):\n  os.system('notify-send \"'+title+'\" \"'+message+'\"')\n\n\nA: You should use notify2 package, it is a replacement for python-notify. Use it as followed.\npip install notify2\n\nAnd the code:\nimport notify2\nnotify2.init('app name')\nn = notify2.Notification('title', 'message')\nn.show()\n\n\nA: import os\nmstr='Hello'\nos.system('notify-send '+mstr)\n\n\nA: For anyone looking at this in +2018, I can recommend the notify2 package.\n\nThis is a pure-python replacement for notify-python, using python-dbus to communicate with the notifications server directly. It’s compatible with Python 2 and 3, and its callbacks can work with Gtk 3 or Qt 4 applications.\n\n\nA: PyNotify2, suggested by many answers, considers itself as deprecated as of late 2020:\n\nnotify2 is - or was - a package to display desktop notifications on Linux. Those are the little bubbles which tell a user about e.g. new emails.\nnotify2 is deprecated. Here are some alternatives:\n\n*\n\n*desktop_notify is a newer module doing essentially the same thing.\n\n*If you’re writing a GTK application, you may want to use GNotification (intro, Python API).\n\n*For simple cases, you can run notify-send as a subprocess. The py-notifier package provides a simple Python API around this, and can also display notifications on Windows.\n\n\nSo, given the above suggestions:\n\n*\n\n*The notify-send subprocess approach is already explained in other answers, and\npy-notifier can simplify that, with an added bonus of working on Windows platforms using win10toast, but also with all the drawbacks of a subprocess call under the hood:\n\nfrom pynotifier import Notification\n\nNotification(\n    title='Notification Title',\n    description='Notification Description',\n    icon_path='path/to/image/file/icon.png',\n    duration=5,\n    urgency=Notification.URGENCY_CRITICAL\n).send()\n\n\n*\n\n*desktop_notify seems to use DBus directly, just like PyNotify2, and has dbus-next as its sole dependency.\n\nnotify = desktop_notify.aio.Notify('summary', 'body')\nawait notify.show()\n\n\n*\n\n*fossfreedom's answer covers GTK's gi introspection route. But please note he uses a different API than the one mentioned above:\n\n*\n\n*There's the Gio.Notification API, from Gio 2.4 onwards, mentioned by pynotify2\n\n*And there's the Notify API, from GLib 2.0 onwards, used in @fossfreedom's code snippet.\n\n\n\n\nA: python3\nWhilst you can call notify-send via os.system or subprocess it is arguably more consistent with GTK3 based programming to use the Notify gobject-introspection class.\nA small example will show this in action:\nfrom gi.repository import GObject\nfrom gi.repository import Notify\n\nclass MyClass(GObject.Object):\n    def __init__(self):\n\n        super(MyClass, self).__init__()\n        # lets initialise with the application name\n        Notify.init(\"myapp_name\")\n\n    def send_notification(self, title, text, file_path_to_icon=\"\"):\n\n        n = Notify.Notification.new(title, text, file_path_to_icon)\n        n.show()\n\nmy = MyClass()\nmy.send_notification(\"this is a title\", \"this is some text\")\n\n", "Q: How to avoid opening a second instance?

As problem remains that it doesn't put Firefox in the foreground when it is already running. This only happens sometimes.\nCould anyone help me to edit this script to fix this misbehaviour? (Source of the script which I modified.)\n\nA: Some of the shell code from that source doesn't do what it claims to do; mainly the type that goes:\nif [ -n $(pgrep -f vlc) ]; then (vlc &); fi\n\nThis runs vlc & in two cases. If there are no processes matching \"vlc\", and if there are exactly one process matching \"vlc\". If there are more than one process matching \"vlc\", vlc & will not be run. So these if blocks are rather useless. Just running vlc & instead will likely be more correct.\nBad shell advice is unfortunately commonplace on the internet.\nFrom your problem description, what you want the result to be is that the program is run if it isn't already running, and if it is running, bring that window to the front, and give it focus. To do this, wmctrl could be used.\nwmctrl -a 'Mozilla Firefox' will find a window containing \"Mozilla Firefox\" in its title, and \"activate\" it. That is, move to the workspace it's in, bring it to the front and give it focus. Secondly, if no windows match, wmctrl will do nothing and exit with a non-zero (false) exit status, in which case we can assume the program is not running, and start it instead.\nwmctrl -a 'Mozilla Firefox' || firefox &\n\nIt's still not perfect though. Other windows than firefox windows could potentially contain that string in their title, so we should find a more reliable way of identifying the right window in this case.\nWith -x, wmctrl will operate on the VM_CLASS of a window, which will typically have a unique value per program. All firefox windows will have VM_CLASS \"Navigator.Firefox\" as can be seen by running wmctrl -lx while firefox is running\n$ wmctrl -lx\n...\n0x03ba3d43  3 gnome-terminal.Gnome-terminal  pilot Terminal\n0x04c000bc  0 Navigator.Firefox     pilot Group #1 - Speed Dial - Mozilla Firefox\n\nWith this we can select the window that has exactly \"Navigator.Firefox\" as VM_CLASS\nwmctrl -Fxa Navigator.Firefox || firefox &\n\nThe same should hopefully be applicable for the other programs.\n", "Q: Symlink a directory and automatically sync its content Suppose I have a folder foo with the two content: \ndata1.txt\ncfg.txt\n\nNow I create a new symlink called fo2 which points to directory foo:\ncp -s -R /home/user123/foo /home/user123/fo2\n\nIt's working okay. But then, I try to made new files in foo folder, say data2.txt. When I opened fo2 folder, it only contains a symlink to data1.txt and cfg.txt data2.txt doesn't exist.\nHow to make the content of fo2 folder automatically synced with with foo so data2.txt automatically appears in fo2?\nln -s is not an option because I want the content of cfg.txt in foo and fo2 folder to be different. If I use copy -s -R, later I just come inside fo2 folder, delete cfg.txt symlink and recreate a real cfg.txt with different content.\n\nA: If the locations are both on the same filesystem, you should use hard links. Otherwise, you'll have to setup some sort of synchronization, but that will be extremely inefficient in comparison. \n", "Q: What is the difference between a hard link and a symbolic link? As the title says, I would like to know the difference between a hard link and a soft link created by the command ln. The command man ln does provide information, but does not sufficiently answer my question.\nAlso, it would be nice if someone could provide a setting where hard link might be preferable over a symbolic link.\n\nA:  In Linux/Unix, Shortcuts are known as Links \n\nLinks are of two types: soft links (symbolic links) or hard links.\n\n\n*\n\n*Soft Links (symbolic links)\nYou can make links to files and directories, and you can create links (shortcuts) on different partitions and with a different inode number than the original.\nIf the real copy is deleted, the link will not work.\n\n*Hard Links\nHard links are for files only; you cannot link to a file on a different partition with a different inode number.\nIf the real copy is deleted, the link will work, because it accesses the underlying data which the real copy was accessing.\n\nQuestion: How do I make soft link?\nAnswer: A soft link can be made with ln -s; first you need to define the source and then you need to define the destination. (Keep in mind you need to define the full paths of both source and destination; otherwise it will not work.)\n sudo ln -s /usr/lib/i386-linux-gnu/mesa/libGL.so.1 /usr/lib32/libGL.so.1\n             (----------Source-------)             ( Destination )\n\n\nAs you can see it has a different inode and can be made on a different partition.\n\nQuestion: How do I make Hard link?\nAnswer: A Hard link can be made with ln; first you need to define the source and then you need to define the destination. (Keep it mind you need to define the full path of both source and destination; otherwise it will not work.)\nLet's say I have a script in the /script directory named firefox.\n ls -i # Shows you the inode\n 5898242 firefox\n\n ln /scripts/firefox /scripts/on-fire\n       ( Source )    ( Destination )\n\n\nAs you can see, it has the same inode. If I delete the original file, the link will still work, and it will act as the original.\n\nAbove, I check that the link is working, and then delete the original firefox script.\n\nQuestion: It would be nice if someone could provide a setting where a hard link might be preferable over a symbolic link.\nAnswer: Depending on the disk partition layout, hard links have the limitation that they must be on same partition (-1 point) and can only link to files (-1 point), but if the original is deleted, the link will work and it acts like the original (+1 point).\nOn the other hand, a soft link can point to directories or files (+1 point) and there is no partition limitation (+1 point), but if the source is deleted, the link will not work (-1 point).\n\nA: Both are pointers to files; the difference is the kind of pointer.  A symbolic link points to another file by name.  It has a special mode bit that identifies it as a symbolic link, and its contents are the name of the real file.  Because it just contains a name, that name does not actually have to exist, or may exist on a different filesystem.  If you replace the named file (change its contents without affecting its name), then the link still contains the same name, and so now it points to the new file.  You can easily identify a symbolic link and see the name of the file it points to.\nA hard link points to the file by inode number.  As such, hard links are no different than the first name of a file.  There is no \"real\" name vs. hard link name; all hard links are equally valid names for the file.  Because of this, the file you link to must actually exist and be in the same filesystem where you are trying to create the link.  If you delete the original name, then the hard link still points to the same file.  Because all hard links are equally valid name(s) for the file, you can not look at one and see the other names for the file; to find this, you have to go looking at every file and compare their inode number to find the other name(s) that have the same inode number.\nYou can tell how many names a file has from the output of ls -l.  The first number after the file mode is the link count.  A file with more than 1 link has other name(s) somewhere, and conversely, a file with a link count of only 1 has no (other) hard links.\n\nA: A hardlink can only work on the same filesystem, it is simply a different name for the same inode (files are internally referenced by inodes). A file will only be deleted from disk when the last link to its inode is gone (you rmd or unlinkd the last link).\nHardlinks usually only work for files, not directories.\nA symlink (symbolic link) is a special file containing a path to another file. This path can be absolute or relative. symlinks can work across file systems, and can even point to different files, if you for example unplug an external hard drive and replace it with another one, which has a different file at the same path.\nA symlink can point to either files or directories.\n\nA: \"A picture is worth a thousand words.\"\n\n\nAnd, \"An example is worth a hundred paragraphs...\"\nCreate two files:\n$ touch blah1   \n$ touch blah2\n\nEnter some data into them:\n$ echo \"Cat\" > blah1\n$ echo \"Dog\" > blah2\n\nAnd as expected:\n$ cat blah1; cat blah2\nCat\nDog\n\nLet's create hard and soft links:\n$ ln blah1 blah1-hard\n$ ln -s blah2 blah2-soft\n\nLet's see what just happened:\n$ ls -l\n\nblah1\nblah1-hard\nblah2\nblah2-soft -> blah2\n\nChanging the name of blah1 does not matter:\n$ mv blah1 blah1-new\n$ cat blah1-hard\nCat\n\nblah1-hard points to the inode, the contents, of the file - that wasn't changed.\n$ mv blah2 blah2-new\n$ ls blah2-soft\nblah2-soft\n$ cat blah2-soft  \ncat: blah2-soft: No such file or directory\n\nThe contents of the file could not be found because the soft link points to the name, that was changed, and not to the contents.\nSimilarly, If blah1 is deleted, blah1-hard still holds the contents; if blah2 is deleted, blah2-soft is just a link to a non-existing file.\n\nsource: blatantly copying it from StackOverflow!\n\nA: A hardlink isn't a pointer to a file, it's a directory entry (a file) pointing to the same inode. Even if you change the name of the other file, a hardlink still points to the file. If you replace the other file with a new version (by copying it), a hardlink will not point to the new file. You can only have hardlinks within the same filesystem. With hardlinks you don't have concept of the original files and links, all are equal (think of it as a reference to an object). It's a very low level concept. \nOn the other hand, a symlink is actually pointing to another path (a file name); it resolves the name of the file each time you access it through the symlink. If you move the file, the symlink will not follow. If you replace the file with another one, keeping the name, the symlink will point to the new file. Symlinks can span filesystems. With symlinks you have very clear distinction between the actual file and symlink, which stores no info beside the path about the file it points to.\n\nA: One of the answers from the other thread (now linked from the top of your post) mentions this page which I think is a fairly good medium-level explanation. If you're getting lost in the ascii art, here's the tl;dr version:\n\n*\n\n*Standard files are a pointer from the filesystem to an inode which in turn point to physical data. The file component stores its link to the filesystem (essentially its path) and a link to the inode.\n\n*Hard-links, are just like files. They're just an additional pointer directly to an inode.\n\n*Symbolic-links are separate files (including separate inode and data) that store a filesystem path to a file.\n\nThe kernel and filesystems involved translate everything transparently.\nSo based on that:\n\n*\n\n*Hard-links only allow same-filesystem linking. Symlinks can point at any path.\n\n*Hard-links (essentially) point to absolute  data. Symlinks can point to relative paths (eg ../parent.file)\n\n*By extension, if you move the target pointer of a hard-link (which, remember, itself is essentially just a hard-link pointing to an inode), the hard-link still works. Moving the target of a symlink would usually break the symlink.\n\n*Resolving a hard-link would be faster but immeasurably so. That insignificant portion of speed comes at the cost of a inflexible filesystem.\n\n\nI might have confused myself a little but reading through various things, I'm struggling to find the difference between a standard file and a hardlink. The way I'm reading it is every file consists of a hardlink (storing the filename), linking to an inode that points at physical data.\nAdding a hardlink just provides an inode with an additional filesystem-based pointer. Is that right?\n\nA: When to use Soft Link:\nLink across filesystems: If you want to link files across the filesystems, you can only use symlinks/soft links.\nLinks to directory: If you want to link directories, then you must be using Soft links, as you can’t create a hard link to a directory.\nWhen to use Hard Link:\nStorage Space: Hard links takes very negligible amount of space, as there are no new inodes created while creating hard links. In soft links we create a file which consumes space (usually 4KB, depending upon the filesystem)\nPerformance: Performance will be slightly better while accessing a hard link, as you are directly accessing the disk pointer instead of going through another file.\nMoving file location: If you move the source file to some other location on the same filesystem, the hard link will still work, but soft link will fail.\nRedundancy: If you want to make sure safety of your data, you should be using hard link, as in hard link, the data is safe, until all the links to the files are deleted, instead of that in soft link, you will lose the data if the master instance of the file is deleted.\n\nA: The confusion sets in when you try to find the difference between \"the file name\" and a hard link because there is none.\nEvery file you create consists of data on the disk and a hard link - which is a file name in a directory and a pointer to the data on the disk. End of story. When the last (or only) hard link is deleted, then the OS knows that the data is no longer needed.\nFrom this you can see that the actual data is never deleted, only the hard link(s) are. And when it gets sufficiently crowded on the disk, the data might get overwritten by another file's data. Until then, the data from the deleted file might be recovered, but it's kinda hard to find without the hard link.\nSymlinks, as previously explained, simply tell you \"there's a file named <targetname> in a folder named <targetfolder>\". They point to the hard link. They don't know where the data is. The hard link knows that.\n\nA: It's very simple. Files (and directories!) are stored at addresses on the block device (HDD or whatever). Normally you have a single name mapped to an address, and that's how you get your file. A hard link is a second, third, etc name mapped to the same address. A symbolic link instead refers to the symbol - the name - and so is a second name mapped to the first name. As far as the kernel is concerned, once it reads the symbolic link target it stops and goes back to the beginning with the target value as the filename (more or less) so relative symlinks are possible but wildly unhelpful. The target name is not used above the filesystem level except if it's explicitly queried in userspace code.\n", "Q: Headphones Don't work I have a problem.

If I click on some magnet torrent link, Deluge opens but I cannot choose which files in the torrent to download. If I save the torrent file on desktop and drag&drop it do Deluge, I have then an option to choose which files I want to download. \nIs there some hack to have the same option when Deluge activates on some magnet url?\n\nA: This is a limitation of magnet uris vs torrent files. Magnet uris only contain the torrent's infohash and optional the tracker and torrent name, whereas a torrent file will also contain the metadata about the torrent's files. The only way to retrieve the torrent's metadata when using magnets is by connecting and downloading from a peer, which takes time. \nIn future workarounds for this may well be implemented but currently you will have to add the magnet, wait for the metadata from peers, then choose the files you wish to download. \n\nA: I found a few tutorials on how to get a .torrent file out of magnet link:  this seems to be the easiest:\nhttp://magnet2torrent.me/\nSimply copy the magnet link, it takes a few seconds, then lets you download the .torrent with all of the metadata.   Selecting certain files to download out of said torrent is only available if you set the torrent to FULL ALLOCATION instead of compact.  I tested it with a 2.3 gig torrent with about 17 files.

If I go into the Preferences -> Global Shortcuts, and check and uncheck that box for \"Use Gnome's shortcut keys\", then they work again. Meaning, at boot it is unchecked, and they don't work, but if I toggle the checkbox on and off then they magically work again.  \nSo what does that checkbox actually do?

The card is dual. It has one high end card for demanding tasks, and it uses the low end onboard card for everything else.\nUbuntu at this time does not support this type of vga card, and it powers them both at all times, when only using the onboard one.\nThis results in very low battery life time.\nI am rather new to ubuntu so I had to follow a ton of tutorials before actually finding a script to solve the problem.\nI downloaded an acpi_call folder to the directory /home/anpel, and with the following commands, I kill the card:\ncd /acpi_call\nsudo insmod acpi_call.ko\nsudo ./test_off.sh\n\nNext step, since I had to manually run the commands each and every time I booted, was to make a shell script on my desktop, which I run, it prompts me for my password, and after providing it, it kills my card. The script looks like this:\ncd ~/acpi_call\nsudo insmod acpi_call.ko\nsudo ./test_off.sh\necho VGA card dead\nexit\n\nNow, I am trying to make my system run this script every time my computer boots, so I don't have to do it manually every time.\nI don't have the experience to change anything to my system without at least some guidance, because I think it's highly likely I will mess everything up, and I have no idea how to clean up my mess, so I haven't really tried anything, but I am reading that adding my script to the /etc/rc.local file will get the job done.\nIs that true or is there something else I have to try?\n---- EDIT -----\nI use ubuntu 11.10, sorry for not mentioning that.\n\nA: The correct place for scripts that are to be run at boot is to call the script from /etc/rc.local\nThe comments in the file sum it up:\n#!/bin/sh -e\n#\n# rc.local\n#\n# This script is executed at the end of each multiuser runlevel.\n# Make sure that the script will \"exit 0\" on success or any other\n# value on error.\n#\n# In order to enable or disable this script just change the execution\n# bits.\n#\n# By default this script does nothing.\n\n\nA: You could run your script file as a Startup Application (System - Preferences - Startup Applications in Ubuntu 10.04 LTS - not sure where the equivalent is in 11.10).\nFor example, to run the inosync utility on bootup, I added an entry in Startup Applications with\nName=inosync\nCommand=/home/toaster/inosync.sh\nComment=Mirror DataDisk to Barracuda_01 \n\nThe bash script file inosync.sh must be enabled to execute.

If so you have more trouble than you think since ubuntu does not by default support dual vga cards (nvidia optimus) at this point.\nI have the gt540m and had to do quite some searching on that.\nI did my searching in december, and by the time, the only option available was to download a module and run some commands, so that you kill your high end card and only work on your low end, onboard card.\nYou can find details on that here: http://hybrid-graphics-linux.tuxfamily.org/index.php?title=Acpi_call\nI searched a bit now to look for your answer, and looks like there have been a few developments in the topic in the past couple of months. A team was working on a project called bumblebee, designed to help ubuntu support optimus cards, and they seem to have released it. I found this tutorial on how to use it, but this is something I have not yet used myself/have no idea if it will mess my system up or not.\nLong story short, your options are A: kill your card, work with onboard one, or B: try making your system compatible.\nHope this helps.

You may need to debug the gksu.py wrapper script\nTo configure your device:\nInstall fprint\nsudo apt-get install fprint-demo libfprint-dev libfprint0 libpam-fprint aes2501-wy\n\nNext, enroll your fingers using either the terminal or a graphical user interface.\nTerminal\npam_fprint_enroll\n\nGraphical\nfprint_demo\n\nNext, configure PAM so that the fingerprint reader can be useful. \ngksu gedit /etc/pam.d/common-auth\n\nAdd this at the top of the file (do it multiple times for however many attempts you want to allow)\n# Fingerprint only\nauth sufficient pam_fprint.so\n\nOr, use these options if you want to require the fingerprint and the password.\n# Fingerprint + password\nauth required pam_fprint.so\n\nFor programs using gksudo/gksu, copy the wrapper gksu.py below to /usr/local/bin/gksu add fingerprint support and enter the following code\nsudo mv ./gksu.py /usr/local/bin/gksu\nsudo chmod 755 /usr/local/bin/gksu\nsudo apt-get install python-gnome2-extras python-pexpect\n\ngksu.py\n\n#!/usr/bin/python\n# -*- coding: UTF-8 -*-\n#\n#       gksu wrapper, supporting fprint - v 0.2\n#       \n#       Copyright 2008 Thimo Kraemer <thimo.kraemer@joonis.de>\n#       \n#       This program is free software; you can redistribute it and/or modify\n#       it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by\n#       the Free Software Foundation; either version 2 of the License, or\n#       (at your option) any later version.\n#       \n#       This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,\n#       but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of\n#       MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.

Please, remember to mark this bug as affecting you in order to fix it as soon as possible.\n", "Q: How to enable Windows 7 recovery after installing Ubuntu? I bought a Asus K series laptop with Windows 7 Home Premium. I removed Windows and installed Ubuntu.\nI left the recovery partition untouched and Ubuntu created an entry in GRUB named Windows Recovery Environment (loader). When I boot into this, Windows 7 logo appears and then a screen with Asus logo appears but the laptop reboots automatically without displaying the recovery options window.\nIn the default setup, F9 loaded the recovery screen but now that doesn't work either. What should I do to recover the factory setup of Windows?\n\nA: Depending on how you removed Windows, it may not be possible. Many laptops ship with a recovery partition, which holds all the information required to rebuild the initial setup.\nWhen you ran your Ubuntu install, did you let it use the entire drive, or did you limit it to the partition that Windows used to be in? If it used the entire drive, you're recovery is hosed, I'm afraid. \nYou may be able to speak to the shop that provided the laptop and ask for the OEM install media (you normally create this yourself when you first receive a new Windows laptop) - I think they should provide it, but in many areas they don't.\n\nA: I figured it out accidentally. Hitting just F9 or booting into the Windows Recovery Environment grub option doesn't work. Only a combination of both works!\nF9 must be hit before grub loads and then the Windows Recovery Environment must be chosen for boot in grub.\n", "Q: Can Brasero damage my drive? My CD/DVD burner failed after using Brasero to burn a CD (which failed).\nI've ordered a new drive but was wondering could Brasero have caused the damage?\nIt was probably just a coincidence that my drive failed then but I want to be sure.\nI've studied up on genisoimage and wodim and will use them instead in the future.\n\nA: It's more than unlikely that Brasero caused your drive to fail. Brasero cannot really cause hardware damage, and so if your drive is failing, it's likely that the hardware itself was already faulty or needed replacement.\n", "Q: asked for sudo password, post login to bash shell With 11.10 when any of my users with the bash shell login upon success they are asked to provide their sudo password e.g.\nLast login: Fri Jan 20 19:13:36 2012 from x.x.x.x\n[sudo] password for *user*:\n\nHowever, using a different shell (viz. zsh) they aren't asked for their sudo password.\nWhat's up?\n[edit: more info]\nSo, of course it was obvious, but strange still.\n/etc/bash.bashrc\n#!/bin/sh -e\n#execute firstlogin.sh only once\nif [ ! -e /root/firstlogin_done ]; then\n    if [ -e /root/firstlogin.sh ]; then\n        /root/firstlogin.sh\n    fi\n    # This part should not be necessary any more\n    # sudo dpkg-reconfigure -p critical console-setup &> /dev/null\n    sudo touch /root/firstlogin_done\nfi\n\nThe file is created just fine e.g.\n$sudo ls -al /root/firstlogin_done\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root 0 2012-02-29 16:04 /root/firstlogin_done\n\n[edit: is it a bug]\nSo, I get why this happens. But, I don't get why this is happening. Is this a bug that I haven't updated?\n\nA: The test fails since permission on /root is 700. Hence, it uses sudo to clobber the file on every login.\n\nA: Ok, turning comment into answer.\nThis seems to be related to bug https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+bug/409335. I can't fathom why anyone would think that was a good idea to use sudo in /etc/bash.bashrc. Not to mention the hashbang being completely wrong for a bash script.\nHowever, /etc/bash.bashrc isn't really needed. Vanilla bash doesn't even read /etc/bash.bashrc; it's mainly a Debian/Ubuntu thing to have bash patched to specifically look for, and source, /etc/bash.bashrc when starting bash interactively.\nAnyway, if you want the /etc/bash.bashrc that a fresh install will have, grab the sources and copy the etc.bash.bashrc file to /etc/bash.bashrc\nsudo apt-get install dpkg-dev\napt-get source bash\nsudo cp bash-4.2/debian/etc.bash.bashrc /etc/bash.bashrc\n\n", "Q: How do I recover my main Login Password? I have forgot my main password for main log in and for everything that I need to authenticate things for.\nHow can I recover or reset my password?\n\nA: You cannot recover the password, but you can change it to log in again.\nWhen you boot, hold down the Shift key until you get the Grub menu.\nChoose the item (usually the second one) that reads, \"Ubuntu, with Linux ... (recovery mode)\".\nWhen it boots, select the option \"root -- Drop to root shell prompt\".\nYou will see a flashing cursor. Type the following and press Enter:\npasswd user\n\nbut replace \"user\" with your username.

If I put a timer and make the script wait, they work.\nIs there a upstart variable that I can use to ensures command line utilities are fully loaded and available when my script executes?\n\nA: Well the proper way of doing things is to use events. Other Upstart scripts emit signals when they are doing things, this way you can have:\nstart on (local-filesystems and net-device-up IFACE!=lo)\n\n... and your script won't start until the filesystem and local networking are ready for business.\nThis still might not work for you (I'm not sure what level you need to wait until) but have a play around, listening to different events.\nYou can read more about start-on in the cookbook.\n", "Q: Import media doesn't set the artist and album for all my tracks I've recently moved the house PC from Windows 7 to Ubuntu.

Please help!\n\nA: You can't use wget the way you're trying to, I'm afraid. The Ubuntu One website requires you to be logged in to see your files; wget, because it's running from the command line and not in your browser, isn't logged in when it connects to the U1 website, and so can't see your files.\nIf you're using a recent version of Google Chrome, you may find http://kryogenix.org/days/2012/02/29/downloading-all-the-files-in-an-ubuntu-one-folder useful (please read the caveats!).

It says there are no proprietary drivers available.  \nThe driver I want to install came in a folder named hybrid-portsrc_x86_32 followed by -v5_100_82_112.  (The contents of this folder are folders named lib and src and a file named Makefile.)  Where should it go in my Ubuntu folders, so it shows up on the Hardware Drivers list?\n\nA: According to what I believe is the readme for this driver, it should already be available in Ubuntu's repos. If it does not appear in the third-party drivers menu, the readme says to run \nsudo apt-get install --reinstall bcmwl-kernel-source\n\nAnd then reboot. Have you tried this?\n", "Q: Can I usably run Photoshop in a Windows VM with this setup? I'm researching hardware in order to build a new PC and I'd like to run linux as my main OS and just run windows in a VM. Do you think it'll be fast enough to run photoshop in a windows VM or will I still have to dual boot? Are the graphics supported by Ubuntu (both the Radeon card and the integrated chipset)?\nMy current plan is here as an amazon wish list.\nIn summary:\n\n\n*\n\n*CPU - Intel i5 2500k\n\n*MOBO - Gigabyte Z68XP-UD3\n\n*Memory - Corsair 16GB (4x4GB) 1600MHz\n\n*Graphics - Asus 1GB Radeon HD 6850 PCI-E 2\n\n*SRT - Nocti mSATA 60GB SSD (just for the caching, I have another drive for main HDD)\n\n\nCheers,\nMatt\n\nA: Those specifications will be more then adequate for your expressed need. You could probably use an i3 and less ram (4-6 Gb) if money is tight.\nMy only concern would be with the ati card, you might check compatibility with that (or wait for someone with more ATI experience then I have to comment.\n\nA: Depending on which version of Photoshop, WINE is also an option. I run CS2 on my i5-based Lenovo laptop with a pretty wimpy integrated graphics card and it runs quite well.\n\nA: Theoretically, it should work. As for any problem with graphics, there should be a check-box in Photoshop settings that allows you to enable/disable GPU acceleration. With GPU acceleration disabled, Photoshop should work without any problems.\n", "Q: Missing /dev/xconsole causes rsyslog to stop as well as all other services I'm running Ubuntu-10.04.04LTS in Hyper-V environments. I found that SSH, HTTP or any other service else stopped because the rsyslog daemon had died with the message unable to find the /dev/xconsole file.\nI fixed it temporarily with the following.\nFILE=/dev/xconsole\nif [ -e $FILE ]; then\n     echo \"$FILE exists Carry on!\"\nelse\n     mknod -m 640 /dev/xconsole c 1 3\n     chown syslog:adm /dev/xconsole\n     echo \"Created $FILE.\"\nfi\n\nThe problem is that I can not get rsyslog daemon to process these 8 lines when I restart the daemon. \nAlso restarting the daemon removes the /dev/xconsole file and we are back to all service stopped. In addressing this problem I have inserted the if--fi lines after the start and restart conditions in the rsyslog script. The problem is I do not get an echo to stdio. Does someone have an idea on how to make the rsyslog report to stdio when it creates the /dev/xconsole device?\n\nA: The reason this exists is because Ubuntu Server 12.04 incorrectly assumes you have xterminal installed.  It may be a hang over from their desktop OS where it does perhaps exist by default.\nAnyway, best thing to do is simply comment it out of /etc/rsyslog.d/50-default.conf as follows:\n# daemon.*;mail.*;\\\n#        news.err;\\\n#        *.=debug;*.=info;\\\n#        *.=notice;*.=warn       |/dev/xconsole\n\nAnd viola, no more error.  \nBTW. I doubt that was causing it to die though.\n", "Q: How to tell Chrome what to do with a magnet link? Right now Chrome throws its apron over its head and calls Firefox, which opens the link with rtorrent.  What do I need to do to eliminate the Firefox step?\n\nA: Chrome (or Chromium) protocol handling works differently than in Firefox.  Firefox basically keeps track of all that itself, which is why you can configure protocol handling (like magnet links) in the Applications part of the Preferences.  Chrome, however, relies on xdg-open.\nThere are a couple things that you need to do before xdg-open will handle magnet links properly.\n\n\n*\n\n*Find the name of the desktop file of the program you want to handle the magnet link.  Let's suppose the program is Transmission.  It (like usual) has its desktop file in /usr/share/applications/ and in fact, by perusing the listing of the directory, I find that my version of transmission is actually the gtk version, so its desktop file is called transmission-gtk.desktop.  \n\n*It's possible the desktop file is messed up.  So you can check that /usr/share/applications/transmission-gtk.desktop contains the lines:\nExec=transmission-gtk %U\n[some lines omitted]\nMimeType=application/x-bittorrent;x-scheme-handler/magnet;\n\nNote the %U in the Exec line.  It's absolutely necessary.  The MimeType line should look as above. \n\n*Now for the essential step to tell xdg-open to open magnet links using Transmission.  In the terminal, type:\nxdg-mime default transmission-gtk.desktop x-scheme-handler/magnet \n\n\n*(Step not necessary if you use Gnome, KDE, Xfce, or LXDE) Lastly, xdg-open assumes you are running one of the standard desktop environments:   gnome, kde, xfce and lxde.  If you are not, xdg-open will not work on magnet links.  As suggested on the Arch wiki, you can simply modify /usr/bin/xdg-open.  At the end of the file, you'll find a portion that starts with:\ndetectDE\nif [ x\"$DE\" = x\"\" ]; then\n   DE=generic\n\nchange generic to one of gnome, kde, xfce, or lxde.  I chose xfce since I actually have an Xfce session that I've configured and use on occasion.  \nThe downside to this approach is that if xdg-open gets updates, you'll have to redo this.  The Arch wiki suggests another approach that avoids this flaw (but has its own downside).\nWarning: The choice in the last step is more important than it might seem.  Picking lxde did not work for me!  In xdg-open, the helper function open_lxde relies on pcmanfm (lxde file manager) and something is wrong with either the code in open_lxde or perhaps it's pcmanfm's fault. \n\n\nA: just drag the magnet link into Transmission window and it works fine for me without any tweaks.... I am using a stock build of Lubuntu 12.10 nothing fancy....\n\nA: Worked very nice to open magnets from Chrome with qBitorrent in Lubuntu \n\nxdg-mime default qBittorrent.desktop x-scheme-handler/magnet\n\n\nA: In Ubuntu 20.04, run one of the following commands.\nWebtorrent\nxdg-mime default webtorrent-desktop.desktop x-scheme-handler/magnet\nTransmission\nxdg-mime default transmission-gtk.desktop x-scheme-handler/magnet\nAny other torrent application\nX.desktop file must exist in the /usr/share/applications directory\n\nA: if you use xfce and don't want to mess anything, you could use my solution. I fixed by manually editing xdg-open as follows:\nFirst of all make sure you have the mime associated (as explained before, with xdg-mime)\nThen backup xdg-open as root (sudo if that applies)\n# cp /usr/bin/xdg-open /usr/bin/xdg-open.old\nFinally, edit as root /usr/bin/xdg-open, find open_xfce() and add the lines marked with +, e.g., with nano\n# nano /usr/bin/xdg-open\nopen_xfce()\n+ if [ \"\\`echo $1 | sed -n 's/\\(^[[:alnum:]+\\.-]*\\):.*$/\\1/p'\\`\" == \"magnet\" ]; then\n+     gnome-open \"$1\"\n+ else\n      exo-open \"$1\"\n+ fi\n\nit only adds the exception for the magnet links, so they will be opened with gnome-open instead of exo-open. \nHope it helps.\n\nA: None of the other suggestions I found worked for me, but this did the trick under Debian / Xfce ( from http://fluxcode.net/archives/57 ):\nIn /usr/bin/xdg-open add the following lines to open_xfce()\nopen_xfce()\n{\n if(echo \"$1\" | grep -q '^magnet:'); then\n    transmission-gtk \"$1\" \n    if [ $? -eq 0 ]; then\n       exit_success\n    fi\n fi\n\nexo-open \"$1\"\n\n\nA: A guy in alt.os.linux.slackware found the solution:\nhttp://www.void.gr/kargig/blog/2012/01/24/open-magnet-urls-with-xdg-open/\n\nA: Using gnome-open on XFCE worked out for me.\nThis can be forced with editing /usr/bin/xdg-open and change\nif [ x\"$DE\" = x\"\" ]; then\n  DE=generic\nfi\n\nto\nif [ x\"$DE\" = x\"\" ]; then\n  DE=generic\nfi\nDE=gnome\n\n\nA: This works for me in ubuntu 18 with FF (for deluge):\ngio mime x-scheme-handler/magnet deluge.desktop\n\nI know that doesn't answer the question but I use Chrome too and this is a better work around than copying and pasting the magnet link.\n\nA: I mixed few answers (that unfortunately didn't work for me) and came up with something that made it work like a charm!\nIt worked on Linux Mint 16 under XFCE, anyways.\nMake backup of xdg-open under /usr/bin, open your xdg-open with sudo and then make open_xfce() function exactly like this:\nopen_xfce()\n{    \n    if (echo \"$1\" | grep -q '^magnet:'); then\n        gnome-open \"$1\"\n    else\n        exo-open \"$1\"\n    fi\n}\n\nIt's dirty and you need to edit it every xdg-open update, but hey, it works!\n\nA: I've tried for years to fix this and switch to Chrome and nothing seems to work. I finally had a thought I'm not sure why I didn't think of before and it works great. I'm using Tixati in Mint but it should work universally. Chrome points magnet links to usr/bin/transmission-gtk so I renamed that to transmission-gtk.old and renamed tixati to transmission-gtk and picked the option in chrome to always do this and hit launch app and now mag links go straight into Tixati just like Firefox. Problem finally solved!\n", "Q: Cannot run update due to a dpkg error with burg-theme-minimal-sir I cannot run an update or indeed run $: apt-get remove  due to a dpkg error with a package that's a part of super-boot-manager.

How do we change each via the command line? Is the solution the same for all currently supported releases?\nAnd for those who would rather use the gui method, how is that done?\nAt the bottom of this pic is the checkbox for a passwordless login.  It says:\n\nDon't ask for password on login\n\nHow do I do this with the command line?\n\n\nA: I honestly don't know the difference. I'm not sure I've seen the phrase \"passwordless login\" where I haven't just assumed they're talking about auto-login.\nFor machines that use LightDM (11.04 up) you can add a user to the configuration in /etc/lightdm/lightdm.conf using the autologin-user variable so the file ends up looking something like this:\n[SeatDefaults]\nautologin-guest=false\nautologin-user=oli\nautologin-user-timeout=0\nautologin-session=lightdm-autologin\ngreeter-session=\nuser-session=ubuntu\n\nThat gives you a screen where that user (oli in this case) is logged in automatically after a few seconds.

I think Oli turned off/changed a few too many things by clearing greeter-session.  In my case, I want the UI to run.

It will probably eat your babies.\n\nA: ok,\n  thinking this through ... you mentioned that you had activated the Post Release updates NVIDIA driver through the Additional Drivers window.\nBehind the scenes this would have installed the nvidia-current-update package.\nBy installing the X-Swat package - this gives you a new nvidia-current package but as you can see, your nvidia-current-update package is taking precedent.\nFIRST\nPlease image your computer - messing about with graphics drivers can leave you with non-booting & black screen issues.  If you are not confident with resolving this through the recovery mode and terminal, then either do not proceed or have an image that you can readily restore.\nNext\nNow the warning is explained - deactivate the Post Update driver in Additional Drivers window.  Rename you current xorg.conf file and reboot\ni.e.\nsudo mv /etc/X11/xorg.conf /etc/X11/xorg.conf.backup\n\nYou should now be using the default opensource nouveau drivers.\nNext, purge your old nvidia packages:\nsudo apt-get purge nvidia-*\n\nReboot.\nNext add the X-Swat PPA:\nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:ubuntu-x-swat/x-updates\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get upgrade\nsudo apt-get install nvidia-current nvidia-settings\n\nReopen your Additional Drivers window and activate the NVidia Current driver.\nReboot.\nCheck through gksudo nvidia-settings - you should now be using the v295 driver set.\nSet your twin monitors as per this Q&A:\nDual monitors not working with an Nvidia card\nHopefully now your issue is now resolved.\n\nIf it is not resolved - then the nvidia driver is not the key problem here but instead is either Compiz and/or the kernel itself.\nGiven the imminent 12.04 release in a months time, it will come with the latest Compiz and kernel and therefore could/should resolve your issue.\nI'm reluctant to recommend you pursuing the x-org-edgers PPA route - to do this you should install the Kernel in the PPA as well as the recommended packages itself.\nIf you want to upgrade to 12.04 beta - remember you will be helping out the developers with testing.  There are other bugs that you could have to contend with.  The developers are very keen for testers to test with the 12.04 multimonitor support! Therefore - if your issue is not immediately resolved with 12.04 - at least the developers should be much more keener to help you resolve this via filing launchpad.net bug reports.\n\nA: In the past, I have had similar problems when both monitors did not match in geometry. Some references I have seen suggest they should be matched in scan rate as well, e.g., the same model of monitor. When I had one installation messing this up, with two different monitor sizes, the problem mostly went away after I forced my higher resolution monitor down to the same resolution as the smaller monitor. Don't know if this is the case for you, but it is probably necessary to at least run the same resolution on both for debugging.\n\nA: I upgraded to 12.04 and the problem seems to have been resolved.\nNote that I am not using any additional drivers. The standard drivers for 12.04 seem to be fine for me, allowing 3D effects, full Unity experience, etc. They even allow me to rotate my monitors individually, which is something I could not accomplish with Nvidia.\n", "Q: How to zoom in and out of text in Gedit? I am using Ubuntu 11.10. This seems to be an easy question, yet I cannot find an answer anywhere.\nOn pre-unity Ubuntu, I was using gedit-zoom plugin to zoom text in editor window in/out, either with Ctrl++/-, or by holding Ctrl+ scrolling mouse-wheel. The same plugin does not seem to work in Ubuntu 11.10.\nAny way I can get text zooming capability?\n\nA: You can change the fontsize in the preferences menu under the fonts tab\n\nA: \n\n\n*\n\n*Under Edit → Preferences → Plugins, you can tick the Text Size box and zoom in with ctrl++.\n\n\n*\n\n*Click on gedit-plugins  to install the Gedit plugins.\n\n*You can also manually download/install the plugin.\n\n\n*ctrl+Trackpad scroll (up/down) enables you, to zoom in and out as well, not only within gEdit, but also in your Webbrowser, File System etc.\nBoth possibilities work just fine in Ubuntu 11.10.\n\nUpdate information for Ubuntu 17.x.x, 18.x.x and later, as suggested by code_dredd - tested and works:\nsudo apt-get install -y gedit-plugin-text-size\n\n\n\nA: I didn't see \"Text size\" plugin in the list of the plugins when I\nopened Preferences->Plugins even after installing gedit-plugins package(via apt install) and restarting gedit few times. So, I downloaded manually the corresponding deb file(gedit-plugin-text-size_3.22.0-2_amd64.deb) from \nthe launchpad (http://launchpadlibrarian.net/335063179/gedit-plugin-text-size_3.22.0-2_amd64.deb) for my Ubuntu 17.10 x86_64 and installed it,\nrestarted gedit and saw \"Text size\" plugin thereafter in the list.\nEnabled it and finally got the zoom-in/out feature with mouse-scroll-wheel I much needed.\nCheers.\n", "Q: Where does wallch save the list of pictures and folders it takes pictures from? I want to write a bash script which can remove the current wallpaper from the wallch playlist. By playlist, I speak of that list in wallch to which you can add pictures and folders, telling wallch that it can use these as wallpaper.\nHow is this playlist stored by wallch? sqlite? xml?\nCan I access and modify this playlist programmatically?\n\nA: It would be rather difficult to remove the current wallpaper from Wallch's list while Wallch is running and chaning wallpapers, as the list is accessed by memory (also saved in ~/.config/Wallch/MainWindow.conf, but it is not read by there live, this location is used to restore the playlist, if e.g. computer is crashed or program is not shut down properly).\nIt would be much easier to make a script that autochanges the background while reading an album.wallch file using the command \ngsettings set org.gnome.desktop.background picture-uri \"/path to image/here.jpg\"\n\nand a 'while' loop. Example:\nwhile read line; do\n   gsettings set org.gnome.desktop.background picture-uri \"$line\"\n   #here do what you want, remove image from the file being read, move image to trash\n   #(located in ~/.local/share/Trash/files) and mark it as not wallpaper material.\n   sleep $timeout #<- sleep the timeout you want until the next image\ndone < album.wallch\n\nAnother solution, but too complicated would be the following:\n\n\n*\n\n*Start Wallch normally and add some images, if there aren't any in the list\n\n*Quit Wallch (Ctrl+Q)\n\n*Start Wallch in a terminal using the command wallch --constant\n\n*Remove the corresponding wallpaper from ~/.config/Wallch/MainWindow.conf\n\n*Do whatever you want to do.\n\n*Repeat from step 3.\n\n\nBut I would really suggest the 1st solution, making your very own script for this, if you want to use Wallch only for changing the background image, you should totally use the direct command\ngsettings set org.gnome.desktop.background picture-uri \"/path to image/here.jpg\"\n\n\nA: I use wallch and generally don't like it: It's a pain to modify the list of files (as you see).  It is, however, possible to make yourself a directory full of soft links, and have wallch display those.  Then, your script can monkey with the soft links, and wallch won't even notice.  Use the \"ln\" command with -s to set up a soft link.  If you have /home/me/Pictures/Backgrounds as the directory with the links in it, you do something like\nln -sf /home/me/Pictures/Vacation2013/GreatPic.jpg /home/me/Pictures/Backgrounds/1.jpg\nto replace file \"1.jpg\" in the Backgrounds directory.  It will link to GreatPic.jpg in the other directory, and can easily be replaced programmatically. Use soft links (-s option) so you don't hard-link the images.  Use the \"force\" option (-f or -sf) to delete and replace existing links or files in the directory.\nOne problem: this approach doesn't let you change the number of backgrounds wallch displays.  You only get to change which pictures they are.\nI tried the gsettings command, and found that the \"path\" part needs to have the format file:/blah/blah/blah.  I was surprised to see that http://server.tld/blah/blah/blah doesn't work.\nIs being able to do something with or to the currently displayed background important?  Then you'd probably be better off running a Python or Perl script (whatever you are familiar with), and handling signals.  For example, you could give your script a signal handler that makes it delete the currently displayed file (if that's the sort of thing you intended).\n", "Q: Am I being hacked? I recently let a hacker (who I met once and don't know too well) connect to my computer through (I guess it was remote access)- I had to fill in my IP on a third party website and click a button and he had full access to my desktop and used my command terminal in Ubuntu 11.04 to do a series of installations (that I needed help with) and then disconnected. \nShortly after, I started experiencing random things- solitaire games randomly being opened when I return after leaving it unattended and some other odd things. \nThe icing on the cake was this:\nWhen I typed the 'who' command in the terminal, here's what I got:\n*'myusername'          tty7      2007-04-26  00:14 (:0)\n*'myusername'          pts/0     2011-11-11 21:45  (:0)\nSo my concern is that I didn't even own this laptop at that date, yet alone have Ubuntu dual booted on my system.\nThink I'm being hacked? or is that just the date of the origin of Natty desktop environment? \nWho knows. I might be paranoid. \n\nA: If you think you are being hacked, there are several quick things you can do to stop remote access:\n\n\n*\n\n*Run vino-preferences and see if it is activated. If it is, uncheck all options and if you need it then change the password.\n\n*Change your user password. That would make it tough to access via ssh with that user.\n\n*Verify that there is no other user account. From terminal you can do something like this: cat /etc/passwd|grep '/bin/bash' but there are other GUI and terminal ways.\n\n*Disable the SSH server if you happen to have it install. Type sudo apt-get purge openssh-server. If you don't have nothing will happen. If you do have it, it will ask you for removal.\nUp to now you have just blocked the VNC and SSH services from being accessed remotely.\nNow check if you have some script running when the PC starts. For example something that is being send to somebody outside. This implies having to check a lot of places. For example:\n\n\n*\n\n*Check all /etc/rc* folders. For example /etc/rc0.d, /etc/rc1.d....\n\n*Check /etc/init.d from a weird service that is not supposed to be there.\n\n*Check that cron is not running something. Example: crontab -e will show what cron runs for your user.\n\n*Check that ufw is enabled and does not have some port forward. Also check iptables for this. If a port is forward it might look like he is trying to have direct access to the PC.\n\n*Any other place that might be used for automatic running something.\n\n\nThere are many other ways but this are the quick and basic.\n\nA: 192.168.1.1 is the IP address of your router, it's not a third party website. What you have done is opened up either SSH, or VNC, access to your machine by forwarding that port out. If you repeat the steps but instead of entering the values remove the values you should be able to severe access. It's odd that it would show a user logged in from 2007, after removing the port forward restart your machine to log any connected sessions off.\n", "Q: Can you move the notification popups?

I also see that some things, like updatedb from mlocate, put their jobs there:\n$ dpkg -L mlocate|grep y/m\n/etc/cron.daily/mlocate\n\nSomtetimes, I would like to disable some of these jobs (mlocate in this case). I can obviously sudo mv /etc/cron.daily/mlocate ~/cron.daily-dont-run and be over with it. However, two questions:\n\n\n*\n\n*Is this how this gets managed? Is there something like service to manage SysV init scripts or overrides such as described in Upstart intro, 10.41.1   Override Files? I would like to tell it \"OK, I don't want you to start\", but without touching what is installed (see next item for one of the reasons)\n\n*If I delete and then reinstall mlocate, I'll again get the cron.daily entry. Also, I guess (is this true?) upgrades will probably not go smoothly (e.g. it will make a cron.daily entry or maybe possibly break the package if there's something in the cron entry that it depends on).\n\n\nIf you do, how do you manage / deal with the things such as the above?\n\nA: One way to do it is to chmod -x /usr/bin/updatedb.mlocate . The cron script checks for the +x bit and will exit if it's not executable. Should be less intrusive than messing with the cron files, with the caveat that running updatedb.mlocate manually will be more complicated.\n", "Q: Automate Password Set And Verify I'm using this to set passwords in a script:\nusermod -p `mkpasswd -H md5 passwordText` user\n\nI need to create an exception in my script, just in case this command fails.  What file contains the encrypted password and how do I reverse the encryption so I can verify it was written to the file correctly?\nEdit: I finally found the problem with the line above.  The password was allowing symbols that were being interpreted as wildcards on the command line making it appear as if the command itself failed.  Nonetheless, it's lead me to new things I'm glad I know now.\n\nA: Instead of reversing the the shadow- file, why not just do:\nusermod -p `mkpasswd -H md5 passwordText` user\n\nif [ $? -ne 0 ]; then\n    echo \"Changing password failed!!!!!!\"\nfi\n\nYou could replace whatever you want in the if block, but if a command ever fails for usermod it'll return a non-zero status.\n\nA: The password is stored in /etc/shadow and you can try to confirm it with john the ripper.\nI am not sure if posting tutorials for john are allowed here, if so I can write one easily enough, but if not a google search will show you how.\nLast I looked, John needed a patch, but the bug report on launchpad seemed to indicate that the patch was incorporated into the repos, so I would try the un-patched version first (I know, lazy =) ).\nShort of john, su - test_user -> enter password.\nBrief tutorial on john the ripper:\nInstall john\nsudo apt-get install john\n\nPrepare the working database (I made a user \"test\" with a weak password for this example).\nsudo unshadow /etc/passwd /etc/shadow > password.db\n\nRun john\njohn password.db\n\nLoaded 2 password hashes with 2 different salts (generic crypt(3) [?/64])\nRemaining 1 password hash\nguesses: 0  time: 0:00:00:03 0% (2)  c/s: 222  trying: monday - emily\n\nAs you can see, john cracked the weak password in 0.03 seconds, my user password is too strong for john so I aborted it with Crtl + c\nShow the password\njohn --show password.db\n\ntest:testing:1001:1001:,,,:/home/test:/bin/bash\n\n1 password hash cracked, 1 left\n\nHere we see the user \"test\" with the password \"testing\"\nsu test\nPassword: \n\ntest@ufbt:/home/test\n", "Q: How do I install CACKey?

Back when I had my CAC it worked just fine.\nThen you need to go to (again this is from memory) the Firefox settings. Then the Advanced tab. Encryption sub-tab -> Security Devices. Then hit the Load button and name it whatever you'd like. Then for module filename, navigate to /usr/lib/libcackey.so (Hey, what do you know, I still have my CACkey security device...). Then hit OK.

I have already tried uninstalling flashlugin and then installing again. But, it didnt help. I also tried installing it via Synaptics, but even that didnt help.\n\n\nA: \"Terminal Way\" for people who's avoid plugins:\n\nRemove gnash and lightspark packages:\nsudo apt-get --yes purge browser-plugin-lightspark\nsudo apt-get --yes purge lightspark-common\nsudo apt-get --yes purge browser-plugin-gnash\nsudo apt-get --yes purge gnash-common\n\nThen download file flashplayer*_XX_YYYYYY.tar.gz from http://get.adobe.com/flashplayer to some tmp directory.\ncd /home/USERNAME/tmp\n\nUnpack libflashplayer.so from archive, setting chmod, installing, hardlinking:\ntar xvf *flash* libflashplayer.so\nsudo chown root:root libflashplayer.so\nsudo chmod 0644 libflashplayer.so\nsudo mv libflashplayer.so /usr/lib/mozilla/plugins/\nsudo ln -s /usr/lib/mozilla/plugins/libflashplayer.so /usr/lib/firefox-addons/plugins/libflashplayer.so\n\nRemove unneeded archive\nrm -f *flash*\n\n\nAlthough it is only one method to tune your flash.\nFine tuning of lightspark or gnash also can be good choice.\n\nA: There is another nice alternative, based on the solution of installing the package flashplugin-installer.\nOpen a command line and type\nsudo apt-get install flashplugin-installer\n\nThis will install the default flashplayer for firefox. But in my case I use Chromium because its faster and cooler than firefox, in my opinion. Now we have to tell chromium where to find the path of this installation, since it isn't set by default. To do that, we execute the following command:\nsudo update-alternatives --install /usr/bin/flashplayer flashplayer /usr/lib/flashplugin-installer/libflashplayer.so 1\n\nwich basically tells ubuntu \"hey, there is a plugin library called flashplayer inside  /usr/lib/flashplugin-installer/libflashplayer.so\". Now if you reopen Chromium, or any other browser I guess (and this is the pro of this solution), you should have a nice working flash plugin.\nOne point to note is libflashplayer.so may be located in another folder, so be sure to check first if you can find the file. If you cannot find the file by browsing into this folder, try finding it by typing\nlocate libflashplayer\n\nIf you still cannot find it, make sure you have a valid flash plugin installed.\n\nA: I had this problem from a fresh install of Ubuntu 11.10 a few days ago. It's fixed easily by going to your \"Ubuntu Software Center\", search for flash, and install \"Adobe Flash plugin\". It will install the latest flash player. MAKE SURE you do not have \"Gnash\" it really interferes.\n\nA: Just install the Flash-Aid plugin. It will choose the flash version for your browser version. It worked for me even when adobe said that they will not support flash for FireFox anymore. \nhttps://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/flash-aid/\n", "Q: Will Ubuntu for Android also run when the phone is not docked? Does anybody know if Ubuntu for Android will, most critically, run also when the phone is not docked? Any references will be appreciated.\nThanks in advance.\n\nA: From the Ubuntu for Android Features page:\n\nUbuntu and Android share the same kernel. When docked, the Ubuntu OS boots and runs concurrently with Android. This allows both mobile and desktop functionality to co-exist in different runtimes.\nShared services and applications are delivered using a Convergence API module which ensures the tight integration between desktop and mobile environments. Work is balanced across the cores of the phone. When the handset is not docked, both CPU cores transfer their full power to Android.\n\nSo the desktop session stops running when you undock the handset.\n", "Q: Nicer FTP client than FileZilla? FileZilla is really kind of \"meh,\" when it comes to user interface. I'm wondering if there's something simpler/cleaner/slicker out there?\n\nA: gftp - https://help.ubuntu.com/community/gFTP\n\nWhat features do you want that FileZilla, fireftp, or gftp lack ?\n\nA: You can disable panels from View menu and leave only local and remote views without local and remote files parts below, ftp commands above and queue window on the bottom. You can change toolbars. There are nice styles installed by default. You can even change whole interface layout in Edit->Settings->Interface window. Filezilla is the best for me but it was not easy to start with it. Now I feel the power :)\n\n\nA: FileZilla is the de-facto standard when it comes to an FTP client. It is extremely powerful while remaining very easy to use. You mentioned the user interface, and you're really not going to find much better then FileZilla as far as that. However, here are the top ten most popular alternatives:\n1. Nautilus\nDon't forget the FTP client that comes with Ubuntu! It integrates very nicely with Ubuntu, and is very easy to use. You don't have to install any additional software. However, it lacks many of the powerful features that a full-featured FTP client, like FileZilla has.\nTo use it, go to File > Connect to Server with the desktop selected.\n\n2. gFTP\nAnother option is to use gFTP, a FTP client with a nice graphical interface that is different from FileZilla's, but only slightly. It can be installed through the Ubuntu Software Center or through sudo apt-get install gftp.\n\n3. Kasablanca\nKasablanca is a GUI FTP client intended for use in KDE, but it will work in Unity too. The interface is very simple and it lacks some of the advanced features of more sophisticated FTP clients. It can be downloaded here.\n\n4. FireFTP\nIf you prefer a Firefox add-on, FireFTP is a great one that will allow you to transfer files from within the browser. Download it here.\n\n5. KFTPgrabber\nA FTP client for the K Desktop Environment (KDE). It can be downloaded at kftp.org.\n\n6. GNOME Commander\nGNOME Commander is an FTP client with a very unique interface that supports themes and customization. It can be installed through the Ubuntu Software Center or sudo apt-get install gnome-commander.\n\n7. Sitecopy\nSitecopy is a unique FTP client in that it automatically synches a directory on your computer with a directory on an FTP site automatically in the background. Details at the project's website, which can be found here. Sorry, but I couldn't find a screenshot for this one.\n8. Filerunner\nFilerunner is an FTP client with a very basic interface. It can be installed through the Ubuntu Software Center or through sudo apt-get install filerunner.\n\n9. Konqueror\nKonqueror, a web browser for KDE, can access FTP sites when you type ftp://username@server.com/ into the address bar. it can be installed through the Ubuntu Software Center or through sudo apt-get install konqueror.\n\n10. net2ftp\nnet2ftp is an online FTP client which lets you upload files from the web browser without having to install any additional software. It can be accessed through net2ftp.com.\n\nHope that helped. Please let me know if I left any clients out that you think should be included.\n\nA: If you're after a nice web-based FTP client, www.monstaftp.com is an open source PHP FTP file manager.\n", "Q: Can't make a boot disk ...For the newest version of Ubuntu. \nAm using a Macbook, have tried both USB and CD instructions down to a T with no luck.\nOn my mac, with both the cd and USB I get the error 'failed to read media' or something to that effect.

If you do so, depending on your Mac Book specifications you either choose 32bit or 64bit! Actually it might be, that you choose the wrong architecture in the first place!!!\nAfter downloading either ubuntu-11.10-desktop-i386.iso or ubuntu-11.10-desktop-amd64.iso you open up terminal.app and use this command to burn the image. hdiutil burn Imagename.iso \nMake sure you replace Imagename.iso with your path and imagename, like so:\nhdiutil burn ~/Desktop/ubuntu-11.10-desktop-i386.iso\nYou could also burn your Ubuntu-image with either DiskUtility.app or Toast.app\nIf you now restart you Mac with the new image-cd inserted, you can hold down the altkey after the chime and choose \"cd-option\"!\n", "Q: Install SmoothTasks in Kubuntu / general tarball installation help I'm trying to install SmoothTasks - it's a KDE taskbar resembling Windows 7.

In the last Ubuntu Developer Summit (UDS), the developers from the desktop team and Mark Shuttleworth announced that a new icon theme is coming for Ubuntu 12.04, but... the Beta 1 is out and still no news of a new icon theme.\nHas this being postponed to Ubuntu 12.10 or later?\n\nA: The new Icon Theme is yet to be released for Ubuntu 12.04\n\nA: Unfortunately there isn't going to be a new icon theme most likely since we are past User Interface Freeze, Feature Freeze and Beta Freeze. I did not find any blueprints regarding this on Launchpad meaning it has been deferred to another Ubuntu release.\nA new Login sound and wallpapers are the only ones which are currently expected to be landing in Ubuntu 12.04 Precise soon.\n", "Q: How to lock firefox version? \nPossible Duplicate:\nHow to prevent updating of a specific package? \n\nI would like to lock firefox version in ubuntu 10.10 as we are running our software in firefox version 3.6. Coz of this we are unable to upgrade the latest packages and updates if i do that firefox version is also getting updated to version 10. I just want to lock the firefox version so that it wont be updated. Is it possible?\n\nA: You can lock a version by following these simple steps:\n\n\n*\n\n*Open a terminal\n\n*sudo -s and hit enter\n\n*Enter your password for sudo\n\n*echo firefox hold | dpkg --set-selections\nThis will lock (aka pin) the 'firefox' package.\nTo remove the lock replace step 4 with echo firefox install | dpkg --set-selections.\nIf you prefer a GUI then you can open Synaptic Package Manager, choose the package and from menu select Package->Lock Version.\n", "Q: Why wont my pipeline work? I am trying to make a bash script that will find all the mp3s in my Downloads folder and move them into a music folder.  Why won't this line work?\nfind ./ -type f -name \\*.mp3 | mv *.mp3 /home/mitch/Desktop/Music/$ARTIST\n\nI tried using a pipeline to have the information from the first command translate to the second, but I have never used a pipeline before and don't know if I'm doing it wrong or if I have the wrong idea of what they are used for.\n\nA: The mv command do not use its stdin, so you have to translate the stdin to a parameter, and for this can be used xargs:\nfind ./ -type f -name '*.mp3' | xargs mv -t /home/mitch/Desktop/Music/$ARTIST\n\nAlso, you can directly use the -exec action of find:\nfind ./ -type f -name '*.mp3' -exec mv {} /home/mitch/Desktop/Music/$ARTIST ';'\n\nEdit\nAs pointed out by @geirha, the first command do not work if you have filenames containing spaces. In such a case it should be as follows\nfind ./ -type f -name '*.mp3' -print0 | xargs -0 mv -t /home/mitch/Desktop/Music/$ARTIST\n\n\nA: The advantage of xargs is that command line expansion.  If you had a command that returned a very large amount of text (or many files all on one command) the you would need xargs.\nIf you had several thousand files in a directory and wanted to run some script on that list, you might try \"./myprogram *\", but if your program has any limits on the size of a parameter you might blow the buffer by expanding *.  Also, the command line itself has limits so the command may fails because the command line buffer is overrun.  The use of xargs will avoid the problem.\nlastly, the -print0 on find will put null delimiters for spaces in the returned file names, and the -0 option on xargs will interpret those nulls.  Read man xargs.\n", "Q: VSFTPD proper permission for root user I did set up VSFTPD on my server and can successfully login using a user that has root permission on the server. However, I cannot create any directories outside of the user's home directory. Any idea why that is? \nI have the option\nwrite_enable=YES\n\nenabled. \nThanks for any help! \n\nA: chroot_local_user=YES\n\nchroot_local_user If set to YES, local users will be (by default)\n  placed in a chroot() jail in their home directory after login.\n  Warning: This option has security implications, especially if the\n  users have upload permission, or shell access.

If really really novice user is using Juju and wants to deploy wordpress how would he come to understand that mysql is required to deploy it.\nIf you take another product xyz which isn't as popular as wordpress and has no deployment related articles available through google, then in this case the user has to go through a chain of activities on the terminal to finally understand and deploy the xyz product.\nThe user has to do something like this on the terminal :\n\n\n*\n\n*charm get xyz or wget xyz from somewhere\n\n*cd xyz\n\n*cat config.yaml\n\n*read the \"requires\" interface\n\n*goto http://charms.kapilt.com/interfaces\n\n*find the charm that provides the interface , say charm \"abc\"\n\n*charm get abc\n\n*execute juju deploy, etc\n\n\nYou see what I mean... unless there is another way that I'm not aware of.\nHow would one know a charms dependencies ?\n\nA: What you're talking about is called the \"dependency resolver\" in package managers. \njuju doesn't have one of these right now. But the idea is that it would work like apt, if you did a juju deploy wordpress it would know that you needed mysql or another database and give you some recommendations.\nThis is actually more complicated than it seems, which is why we don't have it. In terms of deployment let's say you are deploying mediawiki and you have 3 mysql services already  deployed, do we prompt you for a new one or do we just let you decide if you want to deploy a new one or explicitly specify which one you want to use? And that's just a 1-to-1 service relationship, when you have more levels to the stack each level complicates what you'd think you'd want to recommend. (This is why it's not in juju, we need to carefully think about how this would work before building assumptions into the tool).\nHowever there are 2 ways we're working on this to make it better: \n\n\n*\n\n*Charms should have a README file that explains how to use them. So a charm could say in it's deployment directions \"I need mysql\", but not all charms have them, including what other services are required. This is something we hope to improve by 12.04. \n\n*We're working on the Charm browser to make it more obvious what a charm requires right on the charm's web page. \n\n\nHere is the bug report for the spec for the feature:\n\n\n*\n\n*https://bugs.launchpad.net/juju/+bug/732194\n\n*How do I subscribe to a bug?\n", "Q: remote desktop only works locally here's my problem, I want to be able to remote control my grandparents computer in order to help them without having to drive 20 minutes to get there.\nhowever I can only connect to their machine when I'm on the same network.\nI'm using the default vnc server vino with vinagre client.what settings do I have to use to make it work?\n(their os 10.04.4 , mine is 11.10)\n\nA: The problem with VNC is that in most cases you have at least one firewall between your destination computer and your machine. That's why you are unable to connect unless you are on the same network.\nISPs used to put firewalls on their ends in some cases (eg. mobile internet) but if you use a router to share the internet connection between multiple machines (or just to make it easier to connect) you need to traverse through its firewall.\nIn an ideal case you have the following setup:\n[You]---[Your ISP]---[Internet]---[Remote ISP]---[Remote PC]\n\nIn this case (and assuming the ISPs put no restrictions on the connection) you only need to know the Remote PCs IP address.\nBut usually this is the setup:\n[You]---[Your Router]---[Your ISP]---[Internet]\n                                          |\n   [Remote PC]---[Remote Router]---[Remote ISP]\n\nNow (still assuming the ISPs do not restrict your connection attempts) the Remoter Router's firewall will block you unless you do a port forward on it to the destination machine.\nSo depending on the remote router you need to create a port forward rule and forward TCP/5900 to the destination PCs TCP/5900 port.\nNotes:\n\n\n*\n\n*It is advised though to change the port on the router to something else to make it harder for anyone to „break into” your grandparent's PC.\n\n*There is a problem with dynamic IP addresses (every time the connection is established, usually a new IP address is assigned).\n\n*You might be better off with a more flexible solution (e.g. TeamViewer).\n\n", "Q: vpn (pptp) service failed to start When I try to connect to a VPN PPTP connection from Network Manager it fails with this message: \nvpn connection failed because the vpn service failed to start.\n\nIt worked without any problem till I installed KVPNC application.

After shrinking /dev/sda4 there is only this 'unusable' space?!\nMy current partitions are as per gparted:\n/dev/sda\n   /dev/sda1 ntfs                (Windows)\n   /dev/sda2 ntfs                (Windows)\n   /dev/sda5 ext4                (Linux /home)\n   /dev/sda7 ntfs                (joint data partition)\n   /dev/sda6 swap\n   /dev/sda4 ext4   50028 MB     (Oneiric)\n   unusable         67000 MB  \n\nAny advice?\n\nA: You have too many partitions created. the count is: sda1 (primary), sda2 (primary), sda5-sda7 (logical partitions inside a extended partition), thats why sda4 comes after all the higher counts. A Master-Boot-Record-formatted disk only allows 4 partitions (primary or logical).\nYou can use the space by resizing/moving partitions accordingly or eliminate sda4, resize the extended partition (which already contains sda5-sda7 (logical partitions)) to the complete remaining space and create your wanted (logical) partitions inside the extended one.\n\nA: I'm not exactly too sure what you are asking. Are you asking if you can install a different version to /dev/sda4? If so, yes.\nBut, I'm sure you're asking about the unusable space. Simply, all you have to do is create a partition on that spot. However, it will be located at the end of your partitions. \nNow, I'm pretty sure that I answered absolutely nothing. I haven't been asleep in 2 or so days and I'm having comprehension troubles... Ugh. If I didn't answer your question, can you rephrase it for a simpleton such as myself?

Open up terminal and type:\ncp /usr/share/applications/(NAME OF YOUR PROGRAM).desktop ~/.local/share/applications/\n\nThen, run:\n gedit ~/.local/share/applications/(NAME OF YOUR PROGRAM).desktop\n\nThe document at the top should say \"Exec\" somewhere.

If you want to make it so that a launcher is changed across all users, run sudo gedit /usr/share/applications/(NAME OF YOUR PROGRAM).desktop but make sure you back up the original first.\n", "Q: Messed up partition table, not recognizible I managed to mess up the  partition table of my main media HDD. gParted cannot recognize it anymore. There's everything I ever had since my first PC. I ran \"attempt data recovery\" in gParted (it required gpart so I installed it), and now it's showing \"searching for file systems on *my_hdd*\".\nCan anyone tell me if I did it right, or should I stop this process and use some of the solutions posted all around here? I activated \"attempt data recovery\" on instict, and then Googled out everythihg else. I also know that nothing has been written to my HDD, I messed it up trying to remove MBR from it, and deleted first 512bytes using \"dd\".\nAnything you can say about this is helpful, as this computer is family shared.\nThanks in advance.\n\nI already ran testdisk and it's processing the HDD already, much faster then gParted. It's on 15% already. I cannot find a hard drive to backup my existing one, but I'm hoping by reviews I've seen for testdisk that it will help without backing up my data...\nYes, the only thing I've done was erasing the first 512 bytes trying to erase MBR because I moved my OS's to a new smaller drive, and expanded the media partition of my old drive to fully utilise it's 500GB capacity only for media. But gParted screwed me along the way...\nI believe that testdisk will help, I'll just give it time and post the results here.\nThank you!\n\nI managed to fix it by just restoring the MBR using testdisk. For anyone that may have such problems in the future, there actually IS an option to restore MBR from the MBR backup. After that, I just set the partition type from BOOT to Primary, and all of my data is here, untouched.\nAlso, my primary disk that Ubuntu couldn't access, well the problem was some RAID metadata, that I erased. There are guides on the web on how to do this. After a reboot, my system works like nothing ever happenned.\n\nA: I don't know anything about what you are currently running, but it should be possible to recover the partitions.\nFirst: Get an empty hard disk that's big enough to hold a copy of your HDD. If those files have any value to you, you'll want to play safe and only work on a copy of the drive.\nWith the HDD and it's backup drive attached, run\nsudo dd if=/dev/sdX of=/dev/sdY bs=1M\n\nwhere sdX is your messed up drive and sdY the backup.\nNow detach the original HDD and run testdisk (sudo apt-get install testdisk, then run sudo testdisk) on the copy like described in this detailed guide on the author's home page: http://www.cgsecurity.org/wiki/TestDisk_Step_By_Step\nBasically, this will search for your partitions and allow you to write the partition table back on the drive. If you haven't done anything but borked the first 512 Byte, there shouldn't be any problems recreating the table.\n", "Q: How can I unlock a password locked rar file without knowing the password?

I installed ubuntu 11.10 very recently, not incredibly IT literate, finding my way around. \nCan't connect from Firefox to my.virginmedia.com.\nI'm warned against continuing because someone may be trying to impersonate the site\nAny suggestions?\n\nA: I would say that's a problem. First make sure you've installed any updates by opening the Update Manager and doing a refresh. Install any updates, restart Firefox and try again. It also might be worth trying another browser, like Google Chrome (just to see if it has the same issues).\nIf it's still showing as a security issue, that could well mean that there is somebody or something between you and the website trying to eavesdrop or interfere with the communication between your browser and the server.\nI'm speculating and it could just be an out-of-date certificate that needs to be updated. If updating doesn't help, you should edit your question to include the details about the certificate. Firefox should be able to tell you why it's not happy.\nBut I would approach this suspiciously.

I tried many torrent clients, opened ports but nothing works.\nI don't know what information you'll need for this problem so tell me what to do and I'll post them. \n\nA: sometimes some isp's will throttle your bittorrent traffic.  some isps can be tricked by forcing your bittorrent traffic to another port and encrypting it.\nwhat i do is force encryption and use the openvpn port tcp/1194 for my communications.  this seems to work for some places.\n\nA: This is probably because the number of concurrent connections is too high for your home/office router to handle. Try setting a lower maximum number of connections (or number of \"peers\") in your BitTorrent application.\nThis is commonly the cause of a whole Internet connection being slower, but it also often causes BitTorrent downloads to be slow (sometimes even when the Internet connection, for other uses, is reasonably fast).\nThere are more details in the answers to this question (which is related but not a duplicate, as it's specifically about the effect of BitTorrent on other Internet activity):\n\n\n*\n\n*Using a bittorrent client slows down internet connection\nTry lowering the total number of connections to somewhere around 20.

Since many torrents have small swarms and thus may be slow some of the time anyway, I recommend showing a popular torrent download. If you create screenshots showing your bittorrent application downloading just an Ubuntu ISO torrent, or something similar, that may be best.\n\n*Detailed information about your network and Internet connection, including whether or not you're on a LAN, what kind of internet connection you have, its speed (if you know), the name of your ISP, if it's a home, business, campus, or other connection, and any other information you think may be pertinent. Giving all this information would be best but partial information is far better than none.\n\n\n(Hopefully, limiting the number of connections will just work though, and the problem will be solved. Hopefully.)\n\nA: Try to set the bandwidth that your bit-torrent client is allowed to use, to a value that is about 5% less (depends on connection speed) than you have available on your Internet Connection.\nYou could be experiencing a networking problem known as buffer bloat.\nThe idea is to prevent the buffers in your router from getting full.\n", "Q: How do I turn off the screen saver using the command line?

Help! My U11.10 was not booting up. I tried to \"repair\" by reinstalling using live CD, option \"Upgrade from 11.10 to 11.10\"  (none of your personal files will be touched). When the installation was almost over, it got stuck on the keyboard layout, it says that all files were copied, and it was waiting for me. Systeme will not respond so I force shut down. When it cameback, it only had a guess account but I can't find my files. \nwhere would they be??? How can I recover them? Please, I need just to get those files. This was my file server.\nThank you!\n\nA: If you're unable to access your files, but you think they should be on the disk, use the \"Try Ubuntu Without Installing\" option when you boot off the Ubuntu CD. From there, it should boot to a usable, though not very speedy, Ubuntu desktop. It's running entirely off the CD.\nUse file browser to open the hard drive, and navigate to /home/<your username> on the hard drive. You should see your personal files.\nFrom there, you could for example connect to the Internet and back them up. Or you could insert a USB thumb drive, and copy your files to it. Whatever you do, make sure those files are safe. For example, if you copy your files to a thumb drive, plug the drive into another computer and make sure they are usable and all there.\nFrom there, you can continue to debug your problem, either by resurrecting the previous install, or installing from scratch. And in the future, always back up your files before any major software installation or upgrade. Additionally, keep in mind you can upgrade Ubuntu versions from within Ubuntu -- you don't need the CD.\n", "Q: I deleted disk partitions - installing Ubuntu 11.04 to WIN7 build - I need windows back but how? \nSteps to disaster \n  \n  \n*\n  \n*Installed Ubuntu 11.04\n  \n*Partitioned drive upon install and gave Ubuntu entire disk.\n  \n  \n  Several months later I need WIN7 as dual boot\nWhat happens at present\nBooting into WIN7 via F9 option at boot .. takes me to Ubuntu.

Are you suggesting that it would work from a CD? In any case, if you can't install Windows that way, you can't install it at all. I believe at one point during the installation Windows gives you the option of loading additional drivers. If you have a driver disk for your laptop, perhaps you can try copying it on a flash drive and have the installer load the drivers.\n", "Q: Help with reinstall Windows XP instead of Ubuntu I have installed Ubuntu 11.10 on a HP Pavilion DV3 laptop for my wife, but she can't get on with it. I love the interface personally, but she wants to go back to XP since it keeps crashing and won't boot up unless I put a boot stick in.\nThe hard drive was a new one (the old one died). I have tried booting from an XP disc,but it just defaults to Ubuntu. I would like to remove Ubuntu entirely and then use the XP disc as a boot. How do I clean the hard drive of everything?\n\nA: If you just set the BIOS to boot from CD rather than HDD (hard drive), it will start your Windows XP installer up for you. Once it has started, simply delete all partitions on the hard drive and create a single big one for the Windows XP install. That wipes Ubuntu completely, especially since it will also write Windows-specific contents to the hard drive's MBR (master boot record) -- the thing where the Ubuntu's boot up menu now lives.\nThe only possibly tricky part in all this is to find your BIOS settings. If you still have it, your motherboard's manual should tell you how to do it. \nIf not, restart your computer and on the first screen that comes up look for a line that says something along the lines of \"Press  to enter setup...\" or similar (common keys are Delete, F2, F12, Escape). That's what you want to do. Keep restarting the system until you find it. Hit Control-Alt-Delete if you missed it. \nOnce in the BIOS's setup, you look for something that is related to the boot order. Set it so that the CD comes before the hard drive, save your settings, and exit the setup. Your computer will restart itself and it will boot from CD, starting the Windows installer for you.\nGood luck!\n", "Q: why can't I reserves more than 3Gb ram for java app using 11.10 32-bit? My system reports 8Gb, but when I try and reserve 6.5Gb heap space, or even 4Gb for a java program it fails. Is this because I installed the 32-bit version? \nFails to allocate heap\njava -Xmx3072m -jar {...}\nStarts ok, but app runs out of memory.\njava -Xmx2048m -jar {...}\n\nA: Believe it or not, this is a frequently asked question. So your answer is here:\n\n\"The maximum theoretical heap limit for the 32-bit JVM is 4G. Due to various additional constraints such as available swap, kernel address space usage, memory fragmentation, and VM overhead, in practice the limit can be much lower. On most modern 32-bit Windows systems the maximum heap size will range from 1.4G to 1.6G. On 32-bit Solaris kernels the address space is limited to 2G. On 64-bit operating systems running the 32-bit VM, the max heap size can be higher, approaching 4G on many Solaris systems.\nAs of Java SE 6, the Windows /3GB boot.ini feature is not supported.\nIf your application requires a very large heap you should use a 64-bit VM on a version of the operating system that supports 64-bit applications. See Java SE Supported System Configurations for details. \"\n\n", "Q: Can see the nautilus menu in Desktop when using Gnome Shell when I update my system several weeks ago, I started to see the nautilus menu in my desktop!

I just configured 4 3TB drives in a RAID-10 configuration but the total disk space in the RAID is 4TB. I used the following guide to setup the RAID-10, RAID-10 Intall. Shouldn't the size if the RAID-10 array be 6TB? According to this RAID Calculator it should be. Anyone have any idea of what might have gone wrong in the install?\nThanks in advance for your time.\n\nA: Yes, it should be 6 TB.  The 4 TB limit is probably due to using the MSDOS partition table, which is limited to 4 TB.  You need to partition the array with GPT to get around that limit.\n\nA: I do not see the Raid 10 or 1+0 option in that Raid calculator. Only the 0+1 or Raid 01 is there (apart from the base raid levels). For what I understand the first level of RAID 10 would be Raid 1 which creates the mirror and then Raid 0 on top of that to create the performance effect. To then calculate the space available after everything is done for a RAID 10 we would use the following (Assuming all hard drives are the same size. If not then the smallest is the base space for all the rest):\nM = Mirrored Discs\nN = Number of Discs\nC = Capacity of Discs\n(N x C) / M = Space Available\nIn your case it would be:\nM = 2\nN = 4\nC = 3TB\n(4 x 3) / 4 = 6TB Space Available\nSo what you reckon about the final size is true. What I might think is happening is that the total REAL space available from each drive is been subtracted from the total final size. So if for example each 3TB hard drive is really a 2.7 or 2.8TB hard drive (The actual usable space you can work with in the hard drive). That is about 1.2TB to 800GB of missing space. So you would be going from the 6TB in theory to the real 4.8GB or 5.2GB. Maybe less, maybe more.\n\nA: Yes, 6TB.\nRAID10 is a RAID0 of two RAID1 arrays. You lose 50% of physical disk space to reduncancy but gain speed from RAID0.\n", "Q: What is Ubuntu's software raid controller partition size limitation? Does anyone know what the partition size limitation is for the Ubuntu software raid controller? If its 2TB, does anyone know how to increase that limitation to 3TB? This is in regards to a question I posted on Server Fault.\nThanks for your time?\n\nA: Every filesystem has limits, and ext2/ext3 were limited to 2 TiB, but ext4 has a much higher limit (that you won't reach anytime soon). So, use ext4 and you should be safe...\nFor NFS shares I think it depends on the NFS daemon/version you use (check the manuals first) and some certainly have a filesize limit. For Samba it shouldn't be a problem, except with older versions of Windows maybe?\nref\n\nA: It has no practical limit.  If you use msdos partition tables though, those are limited to 2TB.  You can get around that by switching to GPT instead.\n", "Q: Problem with team fortress 2 When I'm trying to play Team Fortress 2 by Playonlinux after loading server there is error ,,Internal error invalid parameters received\".

But I agree that it would be nice if the message you got when you tried to do so without root privileges was more helpful.\nYou may want to check if bugs already exist in launchpad about this (presumably under upstart) and if not, report it.

I've bought a blackberry bold 9700, and I have 3G service. how can I use the internet with my computer?\n\nA: Many phones support what's called USB tethering which essentially means that the phone shares its Internet connection with whatever USB host it is attached to. I'm not familiar with Blackberry devices, but USB tethering is a keyword you can search for in the manual and in the phone's settings. \nFor reference, USB tethering was deliberately left out of the iPhone for several years (although it could be done by \"jailbreak\" it), but eventually Apple realized that it's a smart feature to offer. Android also offers USB tethering, so I'm sure that Blackberry can do it too.\nLook in your phone's network settings for something you can turn on.\nAfter that, the computer should be able to detect the shared Internet and just use it. Look in System Settings > Network.\n", "Q: Mysterious Hard Disk Failure? My new 1,5 TB ext4 Hard Disk makes mysterious noises and fails to read and write. But not always. Sometimes it just works. But then I get those following errors. Does anyone know a solution for that or is my new WD Caviar Black 1.5 TB hard disk broken?\n[  551.162286] ata7: SATA link down (SStatus 0 SControl 310)\n[  551.162294] ata7.00: link offline, clearing class 1 to NONE\n[  551.178223] ata7: EH complete\n[  551.190802] ata7: exception Emask 0x10 SAct 0x0 SErr 0x4040000 action 0xe frozen\n[  551.190807] ata7: irq_stat 0x00000040, connection status changed\n[  551.190811] ata7: SError: { CommWake DevExch }\n[  551.190818] ata7: limiting SATA link speed to 1.5 Gbps\n[  551.190822] ata7: hard resetting link\n\nUpdate Mainboard P7P55D LE: http://www.asus.de/Motherboards/Intel_Socket_1156/P7P55D_LE/#specifications\n\nA: That SATA error is not good, but can only really be diagnosed by trying the following:\n\n\n*\n\n*pop this disk in another box\n\n*put another disk in this box\n\n\nThat will narrow it down. If the disk still fails in the other box, try and get the data off it if it gives you some uptime, then ditch it\nIf the other disk fails in your computer, it is the SATA card, replace it (or if SATA is on the motherboard - you'll need to look at replacing the motherboard)\n\nA: Buy a new one, its broken. Now I hope everything works fine.\nUpdate the second one worked for 6 days and now it is broken again. I will exchange it for a new model and hope for a little bit luck.\n\nA: Cause: SATA II hard drives use autospeed negotiation. This enables our SATA II drives to automatically detect the motherboard data transfer rate, making it backward compatible with SATA I data transfer rates. However, some older SATA I controllers are unable to support autospeed negotiation and cannot recognize the drive. This “drive not detected” condition occurs when a chipset is incapable of correctly negotiating the data transfer speed with a SATA II hard drive.\nTo lock the drive at 150 MB/s data transfer rate install a jumper shunt on pins 5-6 (OPT1), shown in the picture below.

I found my computer to have 11 swap partitions originated by previous fresh installs. I want to delete them, and I don't mind doing a fresh install again. The problem is that I am a newbie and I don't know how to edit partitions to delete swaps in the Ubuntu 11.10 install menu. Where do I have to clic? Delet? Change?\n\nA: When installing Ubuntu, there will be a menu right after the \"Install Ubuntu\" button is clicked (not the \"Try Ubuntu\" button). It asks you to choose between these options: Erase all Operating systems and Install, Install Ubuntu side by side, Upgrade Ubuntu, and choose something else. Select the \"Choose something else option\". You will then continue to a hard drive reformatting menu. This menu is very powerful! Once you make changes it can become permanent and data loss can/will occur. If you do make an mistake, click the back button. This should restore your settings back to the original format. Than try again. Now, you need to check/highlight the extra swap drives and click \"Delete\". This will mark those swap areas as free space. After you delete the 11 extras swap areas, click on the partition/drive you wish to add that space to. When the partition/drive is checked, click the \"Change\" button (Not Delete this time!). This will bring you to another dialog box which enables one to change the partition. Re-size the partition to account for the extra space you freed up in the deleting of all those swap areas (note: you need to add the numbers up yourself, freed space + current partition space) and click \"Ok\". Now you have added that swap area space to one of your usable partitions. (Note: you generally want to mount the partition in \"/\"). Also, as a rule, I generally only guess at how much free space to add to the partition. E.g. If I have 342332 Kb of free space, I will add 332000 to my partition. That will leave about 10 Gb or 10332 Kb of free space left. (Swap is used when you run out of memory). Than all you have to do is \"Change\" the remaining free space to a swap area. Just makes the math easier, that's all.  Also, the average person will never use more than 10 Gb of swap. I couldn't imagine how many applications you would need open to run out out all your memory plus 10 Gb of swap.\n", "Q: Why can't my pc and iPhone find each other via Bluetooth? I've got Bluetooth enabled on both the computer and the iPhone, and both devices can see my Bluetooth headset so this confirms that Bluetooth itself works.\nBut when I let either device look for other devices, they find nothing (when the headset is off).\nI'm using 11.10 with all the latest updates. I have not installed any special or additional Bluetooth software; only whatever Ubuntu provides by default.\n\nA: In my opinion the problem lays with the iPhone as Apple only supports headsets to pair with an iPhone and not Pc's. Can you connect to ur headset with your pc, because then the problem lays with the iPhone for sure..\nHope this helps...\n", "Q: Ubuntu says that filesystem is read only when trying to use sudo or su I am currently using Ubuntu 11.10. My HDD has been frequently used for more than 5 years now. When I try to use the sudo command, or execute a command as root, I receive a message stating that the filesystem is read-only. For example, when I try to run sudo apt-get install gnome-tweak-tool, I receive the following output:\nsudo: Can't ipen /var/lib/sudo/aaron/0: Read-only file system\nW: Not using locking for read only lock file /var/lib/dpkg/lock\nE: Unable to write to /var/cache/apt/\nE: The package lists or status file could not be parsed or opened\n\nI have heard that Ubuntu will make the filesystem read only because of disk errors. After checking my hard drive with Disk Utility, I discovered that it has 7 bad sectors. Disk Utility also warned about imminent disk failure. Is this kind of thing normal, and can/should I make the filesystem writeable again? Or should I simply replace my hard drive?\n\nA: Given the age of the disk, and that it has started getting bad sectors, it really sounds like your disk is failing. My best advice is to stop using it, get hold of a new disk, and either try to copy everything to the new disk, or do a fresh install on the new disk, and copy the files of importance from the old (The latter is the easiest, but the former is possible too).\n\nA: I had a problem where I could not write to my Toshiba 500GB external hard drive. I kept getting an error stating: \"Cannot create directory: Read-only file system\"\nNote: I am using Ubuntu 11.10. The software Disk Utility is pre-installed with 11.10.\nMy hard drive seems to be back working now after I did the following:\nFirstly, using Disk Utility I unmounted the drive \"Unmount Volume\", then I selected \"Check File System\". It did it's thing and in my case found no errors. Then I mounted the drive using Disk Utility and hey presto, it seems to be working as it did before.\nIf there's errors on your drive I'd back up everything on it and let Disk Utility try to repair them. If Disk Utility can't repair the drive then a new drive may be required.\nHope this helps. This issue annoyed me Greatly!! \n", "Q: How do I add new wallpapers? I have Ubuntu 11.10 installed and want to download and install additional wallpapers on my desktop. \nHow do I do this?\n\nA: [From memory:] Click on the Ubuntu logo in the top left corner and type \"gnome-appearance-properties\" in the search field. It should now show you the gnome-appearance-properties icon - click to start the appearance preferences with the background tab already activated. :)\nSide note: in Ubuntu 11.04 you'll again be able to right-click the desktop and change the background like you're used to.\n\nA: Click the Applications icon in the sidebar, then search for \"Appearance\", then look at the \"Backround\" tab. (Extra clicks compared to the instructions above, but I use Unity every day.)\nAnd on a side note, you can also add multiple wallpapers to the list of options by clicking add, then selecting all in the folder, then clicking \"Open\".  screenshot:\n\n\nA: You can \"install\" whatever wallpaper image you want easily by right-clicking on the desktop and selecting change desktop background from the menu\n\nand in the popup window, on the right side - where all the default wallpapers are listed - you'll find a + button at the bottom (where you click on), in the following popup windows you can chose from any folder on your hard disk any new picture you have already downloaded.\nAs for the \"where\" you download them, use your good friend Google.\n\nA: As you are using 11.10, I would say that the easiest option is to find a wallpaper you really like on the web. Right mouse click and up pops a menu, it should say something like set as desktop wallpaper.  A window will popup and ask if you want it centered or stretched. When you are happy click ok.  Now your wallpaper will be stored in your home folder.  Something like firefox-wallpaper.png,  if you want to keep this wallpaper rename it and move to your pictures folder.\nNow right click on the desktop and click on Change desktop Background.  From there you will see the appearance window.  Where the wallpapers are on the left in 11.10 and on the right in 12.04, click on the wallpapers dropdown list above them and choose pictures, you will see your images in the display window below.  Choose your desired image and viola.  You have your desktop image changed.  \n:)  \n\nA: You can use Compizconfig-settings-manager to assign a different wallpapers for each workspace. it looks very nice.\n\nA: I like to keep the wallpapers I ad in my Home folder to make it more convenient to share with my other PCs and so that I can move it to new installs.

I don't like the auto hide launcher for it is too annoying for me. The launcher stays hidden and to reveal it, the mouse pointer has to be moved to the default hot spot. I'd instead like to have the hide to dodge windows previously available in Ubuntu 11.10. How do I change back to this behaviour?\n\nA: 12.04\nHere is the solution:\nhttps://help.ubuntu.com/community/Unity-ReplaceDodgeWindowsBehavior\nhave fun!\n\nA: 12.04\nthis feature called dodge. was dropped from unity.\nthere are unofficial solutions to get it back.\nThere are two window dodge behaviours available: one that works mostly as it used to be in Ubuntu 11.10 and the other one only works for maximized windows:\n real window dodge behaviour for the Unity Launcher and you can download it here: \n\nhttp://webupd8.googlecode.com/files/unity-dodge-windows_1.5_all.deb\n window dodge behaviour for maximized windows and you can download it here:\n\nhttp://webupd8.googlecode.com/files/unity-dodge-maximized-windows_1.5_all.deb\nfor further info please see the related section on this post.\n\nA: 12.04\nUnity 2D is the only way to have dodge in Precise out of the box. After logging in, open dconf-editor and navigate to /com/canonical/unity-2d/launcher/hide-mode and set its value to 2 (the default is 0).\n\nA: 13.10\nThis is possible 13.10, at least it tested well in my VM.\nThe older scripts do not work as you(Seth) have discovered.  However the newer scripts that worked for 12.10 and 13.04 work for 13.10.\nThe site webupd8.org has the instructions. As is stated, the instructions are for 12.10 and 13.04 but I tested the one in Virtualbox and it worked flawlessly(well as well as they did in 12.04 up, there are a few limitations as noted in the article but all in all they work well)\nUnfortunately, the ppa for Saucy has not bee updated to include these scripts (at least not as far as I was able to determine) so the only solution is to download them directly.\nThere are 2 different scripts and they cannot be installed together. \nThe one script only dodges maximized windows.  It's biggest limitation is that it will allow the launcher to overlap any windows that were opened while it was hidden.\nThe other script brings back the old style of dodging windows(almost) in that it will hide the launcher when any window is in it's(the launchers) space.  The biggest limitation that I noticed is that if any window is open that is in the launcher's space, the launcher will stay hidden even if that window is minimized.\nHere is the link to download the Dodge maximized windows script\nHere is the link to download the \"original\" dodge windows script\nThe download links that I included above come directly from the article on webupd8.org.\nI would suggest that you read the article on webupd8.org that I linked to at it gives a good rundown of the scripts, (I don't want to get into plagiarism territory by including too much of the article. \n\nIn the interest of full disclosure, I did not play too long with the 13.10 VM but in the time I used it I didn’t notice any unexpected issues with the dodge windows scripts.  I also did not play long at all(maybe an hour) with the \"original\" dodge windows script as the hidden launcher limitation I mentioned above was not to my liking.  The dodge maximized windows script has seen maybe 10+ hours of use with success.\n\nAs an editorial note(read my opinion, which in worth exactly what you paid for it);  These \"dodge windows\" question and workarounds are all over AU and the internet, I don't understand why Canonical is so married to the idea that it was a bad feature.  Yes I have seen the articles about why they removed it and it seems like \"thin soup\" to me, obviously many user want it, and the scripts work well enough.  \nTo give credit where it is due(I think*), I believe that @JorgeCastro wrote the first work-around script back in 12.04(the dodge maximized windows one). Thanks a bunch Jorge, this missing feature was a deal breaker for me and I was considering switching away from Unity(was considering Cinnamon but it was buggy, so you really saved me at least.)  \nI have taken a bit of a liberty in including this editorial, and my intention was not to start a discussion on the subject, just to state what seems to be a common opinion in the Ubuntu community.  Please do not respond to this as a discussion, or I, or the mods will be forced to edit or delete this answer. \n\nA: 12.04\nI'm afraid the dodge window capability was deliberately removed from 12.04\nAccording to Mark Shuttleworth\n\n\"dodge-windows approach tested very poorly. We thought it would work\nwell, tried it, tested it, and have had to evolve from there based on\nevidence....\nIf users encounter the dodge by moving windows against\nthe launcher, then it is fine. They see that the dodge happens when\nthey push the launcher away, they discover they can move the window\nback and the launcher will reappear. So far so good.\nHere's the problem. Most users don't discover the dodging by moving a window till\nit touches the launcher. They first encounter it when they maximise a\nwindow. So, they login to the desktop. Good. They start an app. Good.\nThen they maximise a window, and the launcher \"disappears\". To these\nusers, the behaviour is deeply uncomfortable, random. And these are in\nfact the majority of users. It also turns out that users who can work\nwith dodging launchers can also work perfectly well with launchers\nwhich always hide when not used.\"\n\nBy default the launcher is always visible.\nMore information about how to configure the launcher can be found in the Q&A\nHow can I configure Unity's launcher auto-hide behavior?\n\nDodge Windows is a topic covered by WebUpd8\nAn enterprising developer has written some scripts that mimic the dodge window behaviour when a window is moved into the launcher area - i.e. it hides and unhides as appropriate.\nA similar script is available to autohide the launcher when a window is maximised.\nNote - these are in binary deb format.  Obviously - installing random binaries is not recommended practise from a security point.  Read the article if you wish to pursue this.\n\nA: How to restore Dodge behavior in 12.04\nThis Ubuntu Geek post and this newer WepUpd8 post report how to restore the Dodge Windows and Dodge Active Windows for Unity in 12.04. These can then be set in the Unity plugin in CompizConfig Settings Manager.\nUpdate: For 12.10 / 13.04, please refer also to this WepUpd8 post.\nIt is required to add a ppa:\nsudo apt-add-repository ppa:ikarosdev/unity-revamped\n\nand run a distribution upgrade:\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get dist-upgrade\n\nThen open CCSM and set it to your favorite behavior!\n\n(The terminal is only to document Ubuntu version.)\nYou might have to log out and in again for it to take effect.\nThis patch also restores the old Click-To-Minimize behavior. See this Webupd8 post for details.\nAll changes can be reverted by the following commands:\nsudo apt-get install ppa-purge\nsudo ppa-purge ppa:ikarosdev/unity-revamped\n\nAlternatively, a hack to restore the older Dodge behavior is reported on here.\nI tried out the \"real dodge\" version, and it works so-so in my opinion. Most notably, the launcher does not \"go above\" active windows, but pushes them to the side, where it sometimes gets stuck (so the launcher doesn't go away again). In general, when the launcher shifts position, so does many other things on screen (e.g., icons on the desktop).\nAn alternative is to (almost) permanently hide the launcher (see here) and use a dock with the wished for behavior (for example cairo-dock).\n\nA: 12.04\nIn Ubuntu 12.04 the Dodge Windows feature was removed. To get it back you will have to install basically a patched version of Unity.\nThe easiest way is probably to read the following posts carefully and follow the instructions. There are two different kind of fixes and you'll have to settle for one.\nGet Dodge Windows Unity Autohide Behaviour For Maximized Windows In Ubuntu 12.04 Precise Pangolin and Real Window Dodge Unity Launcher Bahaviour For Ubuntu 12.04, I presume you'd prefer the latter.

I don't know how to do this!! I already installed a new kernel on my laptop, but I don't know how I can transfer it to the server, even if I transfer the bzImage, what about the driver modules and other things?\n\nA: I would:\n1)set up a VM of the base install exactly as your server is but with a larger disk\n2)get the kernel sources package and build deps\n3)merge the ubuntu diff and the patch diff\n4)rebuild the deb with a new name\n5)move the deb across and install it with whatever package manager(apt/dpkg)  \nI don't think this is something for which you should copy/paste commands.  \nEDIT:\nThe gist of it was make a Virtual Machine that is identical to your server in question but with enough space to build, as in do not install the virtual optimized kernel/guest additions...because I don't think askubuntu is not the place to cover compiling against different kernels/architectures.  \nFollow the existing documentation to build the debs.

First off I upgraded my Wifi card from a ralink to a Intel Ultimate-N 6300 and also had to install a Modded bios so the computer would accept the wifi card. I can get my wifi to connect in Windows but when I try to install any linux tried Ubuntu's, Crunchbang, Archbang etc. the wifi card is recognized but when i try to connect to any router I get an endless loop of it trying to connect. if the router had a wep key it will go in an endless loop for about 45 seconds then re ask for the password if the router doesnt have a password it will just sit in an endless loop saying connecting. The computer is a dv6-6135dx with a AMD chipset has the 3500m processor in it 6620g integraded graphics with a 6750m graphic card also.

Quite confused :(\nI had Windows 7 x64, decided to start fresh new so I planned on formatting. Since I use it for work and didn't require it for another week, I didn't rush into installing Win 7 immediately as I wanted to try Ubuntu for quite a while. \n1) Downloaded Ubuntu 11.10 \n2) Burned ISO to CD \n3) Installed Ubuntu using the full HDD of 500GB erasing Win7 \n4) Ubuntu ran awesome (especially for me being a Linux Newbie from scratch) \nI used Ubuntu for a while, but now I need to get back to work with Win 7. Tried running the installation CD for Win 7 and it just skips to Ubuntu without loading. Checked BIOS, tried other discs, even tried the disc on another computer and it works. \nSince that didn't work, I tried running Win XP. This CD does load, it starts loading files, drives, kernel, blah blah and before even getting to install it Blue screens with error 0x0000007b.\nI already used Gparted and created up to 250 GB space for Windows. Formatted to NTFS. \nI really don´t know what do now. I've tried almost everything I know within my knowledge. I could say I'm an advanced PC user, but I bumped into the Linux wall starting from scratch. \nAll suggestions will be appreciated.\nThanks! \n\nA: Well, the only thing you need to do is to make sure in your BIOS boot menu CD has priority over booting from the hard drive. After that you reboot, and provided that you inserted a proper bootable CD/DVD, the setup program should start.\nUbuntu (or any other OS installed on your hard disk) has absolutely no control or influence over this process. \nSo, if your Win7 setup disk brings you to Ubuntu it means it's not bootable, unreadable or has some other problem, so BIOS skips it and proceeds to the next boot option, which is the hard disk.\nSimilarly, WinXP setup failing has absolutely nothing to do with Ubuntu - most likely it just does not have required drivers to access some of your hardware.\n(also, \"I bumped into the Linux wall\" is just plain unfair - Ubuntu installed and booted on your machine without problems, isn't it? Blue Screen of Death is not Linux fault, it's Windows problem)\n\nA: I had the exact same issue with an Acer Aspire machine. Took me a while to figure this out. This is NOT a linux issue. What you should try is changing your hard disk mode from ATAPI to IDE. \nPrior to booting from the Win XP installation CD, hit the F2 key to enter your BIOS settings. Find  your way to the hard disk section and modify it's mode to IDE. Make sure you save your changes before you exit the BIOS menu. Then, continue with the Win XP installation. You should now be able to continue with the installation without the annoying BSOD. \nMake sure you choose your pre-prepared NTFS partition to install XP to. The option to do this will be provided in the blue DOS screen before the GUI installer starts. Use the arrows to choose your partition and hit 'Enter' for choosing it. \nI've heard of XP installations that would assign a letter different than 'C' to this partition. This is not good. It will require some changes after the windows installation - from the XP os, involving remapping of the drive letter. However, I did not encounter this problem.\nAfter the Win XP installation, you'll need to restore the master boot record that windows overwrites. Due to this issue, you'll not be able to boot Ubuntu. The data and partitions are there - just the MBR is gone. This is a two line fix and there are plenty of links regarding how to do this. I'll provide the shortest way here (assuming you did not back up your MBR using the 'dd' command: \nShortest way is to boot from the Ubuntu live CD, then restore the MBR using the boot repair utility: \nOpen a terminal and type this:\nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:yannubuntu/boot-repair && sudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get install -y boot-repair && boot-repair\n\nFrom the Boot repair window that opens - click the 'recommended repair' button. This will restore the MBR and grub settings but will not add the windows boot option. \nSo, finally, exit the live CD and boot normally. Choose Ubuntu from the now existing grub menu. When your Ubuntu OS starts, open a terminal window and update your grub settings:\nsudu update-grub\n\nThis will update your grub menu with the new windows XP option and you are now ready to go and can dual boot to either operating systems.\n\nA: It has been my experience to load Windows first and then load Linux. In the book Linux for Dummies this was one of the recommendations made...Windows first, Linux second.\n\nA: I can suggest one thing, and will try remind you two things.\n\n\n*\n\n*I remember that, some XP installation CDs are broken. Fails during install.\n\n*If BIOS decides what to load (CD / Hdd / USB), linux distro can not decide.\n\n*Check you Hard Disk partitioning method please.\n\n\nLast thing; If you succeed installing Windows, you won't be able to see GNU/Linux partitions and OS. (Windows' choice again..)\nRegards.\n\nA: Your disc drive may not be able to read your disk properly. You can be sure by configuring the Bios to boot only from CD so he won't even look at the hard drive and even then you'll get the same situation.\nYou can try installing from dok, as i see it Seven is to heavy so you must have burned it into a DVD disc in contrast to XP which is much more lighter and is burned into a CD-ROM disc. The problem is in your disc drive, it support CD-ROM but not DVD, GET IT?\ngood like in seven, as this picture would say (too bad i can't put it here (: ):\nhttp://ftp.math.sk/ftp/images/microshit.jpg\n\nA: I quite understand your situation because I experienced that in one of my Sony VIAO laptop. After installing Ubuntu and installed Windows 7 later only to find out that I couldn't boot to Windows 7 environment.The thing I did that worked freely for me was to install Windows first then install Ubuntu later whose grub override Windows allowing me to make a choice of which to choose from. This was how I did it:\nStep I:\nInstall windows 7, during the process create at least three partitions(if you have enough hard disk space).\nStep II:\nAfter installing Windows 7, insert the Ubuntu DVD/CD and try to do the installation. The Ubuntu would ask you the location you are willing to install the OS. Here you have to look carefully. The different partitions usage and free spaces displayed would tell you the one containing your Windows 7(Please, don't select this one for Ubuntu installation).\nStep III:\nMake a choice between the remaining two free partitions. Click the one of your choice and   the popup windows will ask for what type of partitioning you want. Select the backward slash( \\ ) and click Next or simply depress Enter key to continue.\nStep IV:\nThe installation starts immediately and you would have to follow instruction along till you finish the installation.\nWhen your system restart the GRUB would be displayed counting seconds to boot to Ubuntu.If you are interested in booting to Windows, simply use the downward/upper arrow keys to move there and press ENTER key.\nI hope that helps.  \n", "Q: Web capture like adobe acrobat pro?

The Samsung NP305V5A-A04US\nOR\nThe Gateway NV57H57U\n\nA: As an owner of a very similar SAMSUNG laptop, I can tell, if you want the best one at the cost of some time, get the SAMSUNG. The AMD A-Series APU will not work out-of-the-box with Ubuntu 11.10, however they do work pretty well with the lastest updates for 11.10, which you may achieve with a Minimal ISO. That or either using Ubuntu 12.04.\nI would recommend using the lastest propietary drivers from AMD (I think they are actually 12.1), since the few ways I've found to make some heat on the laptop was either expensive gaming or using the open source drivers.\n\nIf that is not a problem, then go to the laptop as it is. SAMSUNG does provide a better build quality and materials. Also, design is more stylish. I love the fact that they use small bezels for screens since you get more space (a 15.6\" laptop will look like a 14\"). If you use your computer at anywhere except total darkness, you will get benefit of the matte-finish screen, compared with the glossy screens which will reflect every light.\nAlso, they use some BIOS-level battery technology, which if you enable, may charge the battery only up to 80%, that at cost of battery discharge time, it will let the battery a longer lifetime. \nAs for the ugly truth, I got difficult to get used to the fact that the keyboard does not have any CAPS LOCK light, but now I use a sound in Ubuntu to tell me so. One thing though, wrist-rest space is a fingerprint catcher. Back-cover too. \nThe laptop feels very solid, except on opening-closing the lid, which may require use of both hands most of the time. Speakers are somewhat weak compared to my brother's HP, still audio is pretty nice and clear.\nKeep in mind, the SAMSUNG laptop is mostly aimed for business. Still, with proprietary drivers, the A8 APU with ATI HD6680G (I think), easily outperforms the Intel HD3000.\nAlso I don't know for the GATEWAY, but the SAMSUNG comes with Bluetooth 3.0.\nGood luck, and if you need anymore info of SAMSUNG laptop, just tell me! ;)\n\nA: Actually both will work in Ubuntu perfectly. I know this answer is very direct but is the truth with the hardware both have. The only recommendation i would have is to go with the one with the Intel video card. It is more friendly when you want to connect it to a TV for movies or to show someone what you are doing on the laptop.\nThat is about it. Both will work excellent.\n\nA: While you should have no problems running Ubuntu on either of the machine, since you are asking for one choice, it will be the Gateway NV57H57U - vis-a-vis compatibility. The i5 with the HD 3000 graphics are a very very common configuration and things should work great out of the box (except perhaps the video tearing problem which can be fixed in under 30 seconds: Solution to tearing with HD 3000). Pretty much everything about the notebook seems to be the standard configuration, and you will have no issues. This is not to say that I am aware of any problems with AMD Radeon Graphics and Ubuntu. It is just that the other option is widely used and tested.\n\nA: both must be work very well with you choose anyone\nbut if you need my opinion choose Gateway\nbecause it's very better than samsung it's have intel core i5 very good , hard disk in samsung is very good because it's black but blue well good will good with core i5\nand finally like all said for you both well good with ubuntu \n\nA: I think Gateway NV57H57U is more friendly then Samsung for Ubuntu.\nI am having a huge heating problem on running Ubuntu in my Toshiba laptop.

How do i get it to run as my user instead of as root.\n\nA: This page has instructions on running minidlna as a non-root user\n\nA: Long story short: Yes, it is better to run processes under non-root if possible.\nIt is not the only reason, but non-root users are used when there is a possible/known security issue involved.

The Alt key is used for many useful commands, but unfortunately it's caught by the terminal window to activate the window menus (File, Edit, ...).\nI would like to either force the terminal window to pass Alt to the terminal or get nano to use some other key/combination (I'm using GNOME Terminal 2.32.1).\nps: There is a related, but different question here where it's pointed out that Ctrl + Right Arrow cannot be bound to \"move forward a word\".\n\nA: The terminal emulation handles that already. If a key combination with ALT is used by the terminal itself, you can just substitute ALT with ESC. For example, if you want to count characters, words and lines in nano and ALT+D is used by the terminal, just type ESC+D.\n\nA: For the Alt key to work in the nano editor, run the following command:\necho 'xterm*metaSendsEscape: true' >> ~/.Xresources\n\nIt will add the line to the end of your personal xterm config file.\nThis line makes the setting permanent for future xterm windows.

Install it with sudo apt-get install gconf-editor command.\n\nA: On my Ubuntu 12.04 with Cinnamon, I used the gconf-editor method, but the path was org -> cinnamon -> overrides -> attach-modal-dialogs\n\nA: Cinnamon 4.8.4:\nCinnamon settings > Windows > Tab Behavior > Groupbox Window focus > Attach dialog windows…\n\n\nA: I found a link with a way to fix this, this method is outdated in newer releases and gsettings should be used instead.\n\nIn GNOME 3 the default modal dialog behavior is to attach the window so both the back and front window will be firmly attached together and dragging one of them will move even the other window, like if they became a single window.\n\nThis behavior can be changed to restore the old way the modal dialogs were treated in the previous GNOME releases. To detach the modal dialogs from the main window you will just need to execute the following command (in a single line) inside a terminal window:\ngconftool-2 --set /desktop/gnome/shell/windows/attach_modal_dialogs false --type bool\n\nTo attach the modal dialogs to the parent window you could execute:\ngconftool-2 --set /desktop/gnome/shell/windows/attach_modal_dialogs true --type bool\n\nAfter issuing one of the previous commands you'll need to restart the GNOME Shell by logout the current session\n\n", "Q: VNC Alternative Is there an alternative to VNC available which is on par with the features in Windows Remote Desktop? \n\n\n*\n\n*No configuration except possible switching it on.

(X11 does not support removing features on the fly - and probably never will). If on the other hand you don't mind starting a brand new desktop session (again via NX or VNC) then you can choose which desktop environment to use (ie: a lighter one), and by default the VNC and NX sessions do not have 3D or other UI extensions (although they can be enabled if desired).

Multiscreen on 12.04 has generally become much better, but there is one thing that really gets on my nerves: there's a mouse magnet of sorts on the middle edge (between the two screens). It's undoubtedly there to make it easier to interact with the launcher on the right screen. But I have enough trust in my mousing skills, the magnet is more annoying than helpful in my case. Can I disable it somehow?\n\nA: For anyone elses reference. \nI ended up setting 'Edge Stop Velocity' to 10,\nLauncher Edge Stop Overcome Pressure to 10, and Launcher Reveal Pressure to 10.\nThis seems to give the perfect balance for me.  No lag when dragging windows between screen.  Launcher is fairly easy to access on both monitors, No mis-reveals when going for the back button in the browser...\n\nA: The \"hang\" is a feature to make it possible to use the launcher in multi-monitor setups when it's set to auto-hide. It can be configured using gconf-editor. The relevant keys are \n/apps/compiz-1/plugins/unityshell/screen0/options/stop_velocity, and\n/apps/compiz-1/plugins/unityshell/screen0/options/overcome_pressure \nRecommended settings to minimize the effect are:\n\n\n*\n\n*overcome_pressure=1\n\n*stop_velocity=20\nThese settings do not completely stop the mouse from sticking, but makes it less likely it will do so. You can reduce stop_velocity further if you want.\nPossibly also /apps/compiz-1/plugins/unityshell/screen0/options/reveal_pressure. The latter can be configured more easily in System Settings -> Appearance -> Behavior.  \n\n\n*\n\n*How do I use the gconf editor?\n\nA: There is a setting for it in Displays:\n\nYou may still get the behaviour if you have a launcher on the right monitor, so use the \"Launcher Placement\" option to select having your launcher on only the left screen. The stickyness between the screens is required for it to be easy to retrieve the launcher there.\nYou might need to log out and back in (or restart) for the changes to take effect.\n\nA: There is also the \"Launcher Monitors\" option in CCSM under \"Ubuntu Unity Plugin\". Switching this to \"Primary Desktop\" solved the problem for me in the laptop + external monitor setup.\n\nA: Also if you want to leave it the way it is I have found that moving the mouse VERY quickly past the middle will let you pass right through it without even the slightest bit of hang time. I still changed it mainly because moving the mouse that fast was a bit annoying. Maybe someone will find it useful though.\n\nA: You can also modify the settings inside of CCSM if you prefer a GUI option. Its under CSSM > Unity > Experimental\nThere are options for Launcher Edge Stop Overcome Pressure and Edge stop Velocity which you can modify.\n\nA: I personally thought it could be a wrong design in an extended desktop where in the middle of the desktop, a launcher is present. Yet, notice that the launcher has new settings :\n\nThe reveal sensitivity allows you to adjust how much the launcher is sensitive to your mouse crossing. The higher, the more you have to push the mouse against the launcher to reveal it. While auto-hide is activated, and about 27 % of reveal sensitivity, you can surf your mouse from the left external monitor to the right one or the opposite, easily without accidently revealing the launcher. Check the poll, if you want to vote for this option.\nThanks to Hanynowsky's answer  https://askubuntu.com/a/111316/29209\n\nA: in CCSM there is a setting under Experimental tab called Launcher Capture Mouse. if you disable it than the effect will completely disabled\n\nA: The launcher capture mouse option in ccsm and the settings>displays \"Sticky edges\" options didn't stop the edge capture from right to left for me.  The only thing that worked was setting the  \"Launcher Edge Stop Velocity\" to 1 and having , that solved the issue for me. No other modifications required.\nI have no interest in Unity launcher menu on my secondary right hand screen, and the hastle this caused in day to day use was an unwelcome pain. I didn't realise the ccsm Unity experimental settings were there so I had to live with it for about 4 months. God that was annoying.\n\nA: The problem only happens when you have the launcher placed on \"All Displays\".  I had already changed \"Settings > Displays > Sticky edge > OFF\", but there was no improvement.  So I changed \"Settings > Displays > Launcher Placement\" to my first monitor only (removing \"All Displays\"), and the problem disappeared.\n\nA: As another option, you can always set the following gconf values under /apps/compiz-1/plugins/unityshell/screen0/options:\n\n\n*\n\n*overcome_presure=1\n\n*stop_velocity=5\nThese settings will basically turn off sticky edges, as well as the ability to access the launcher by using the mouse.\nYou can then use the \"Super\" (Windows/Apple) key (or Alt+F1) to access the launcher via keyboard ;)\n", "Q: File wont delete from trash even after sudo rm -rf ~/.local/share/Trash/ I've tried using sudo rm -rf ~/.local/share/Trash/files/ and even going myself as root doing the same, and recreating the folder its still there, it was from a pendrive at one point and I deleted it but now I cant get it to delete permanently.\nAnyone have any suggestions?\n\nA: Apart the user trash, there could be a trash for every mounted filesystem.\nRun the following command to see:\nmount | awk '$1 ~ /^\\// {print $3}' | while read dir; do find \"$dir\"/.Trash* 2>&-; done\n\n", "Q: install brother mfc7360n scanner I am looking to install brother MFC 7360.

Right now I'm dual-booting Ubuntu and OS X.  The only thing I use OS X for is watching the DRM-ed Netflix stream.  I've looked into ways of watching Netflix on Ubuntu, but it seems the DRM basically makes that impossible (Moonlight project says unless Netflix drops the DRM their Silverlight replacement will not allow watching of Netflix).  \nBut then I realized, hey what if I stream Netflix to another computer running say, OS X, then somehow redirect it (using Unix magic) to my Ubuntu machine?  Is this possible?\n\nA: While not exactly using the MAC - I have had success using PlayON media streamer, which will pull the netflix stream, decode it, and then through UPNP magic give you a streamable connection which you can open in VLC to watch the transcoded stream. \nhttp://www.playon.tv/playon\nIts not free, its not open source, and if you have less than 1 GB of ram expect your transcoding sessions to fail constantly. \nagain, please note, that playon has a licensing fee, or basically a yearly subscription cost. Runs natively on windows (parallels may come in handy here. I can attest I've had quite a bit of joy using it in a virtual machine just for grins. BARE MINIMUM of 1GB of ram)\nalso, did I mention you'll need some beefy video ram or system ram to handle the transcoding process?\n\nA: Regardless of the hardware you use, there is pretty much no way to play NetFlix \"in\" Ubuntu.

Is there something missing form 11.10?\nIf yes, what's the release number with \"the most complete set of applications\"?\n\nA: According to the answer to this question, 11.10 has extra packages on the DVD versions. 11.04 and earlier had additional language packs with a few extra software in the DVD versions. \nLook at the file size differences at the Ubuntu Releases page gives information that\n\n\n*\n\n*11.04 Natty is 4 GB\n\n*11.10 Oneiric is 1.5 GB\n\n*12.04 Precise Beta 1 is 1.5 GB\n\n\nYou can view the extra packages by viewing the seed files of the DVD versions of Natty, Oneiric and Precise to see and make a better decision of which would suit you best.\n\n\n*\n\n*11.04 Natty DVD seed file\n\n*11.10 Oneiric DVD seed file\n\n*12.04 Precise Beta 1 Seed file\nJust remember, not everything bigger is better ;)\n\nA: Why the smaller size?\nThis was the result of a UDS discussion. Here's an announcement Allison posted. Basically, 1.5G is bigger enough to be useful, and not so big that it takes forever to download.\nThe smaller size means less of a big jump from the 700MB CD (which we are outgrowing), with less impact on mirrors (disk space and bandwidth), and means we are still forced to carefully pick what we want on the images.\n\nA: A lot was changed from 11.04 to 11.10. The biggest change was that classic Gnome was removed as a fallback option to Unity. Also, PiTiVi was removed as a video editor and not replaced. Thunderbird was put in place of Evolution.\nOf course, these were only removed from the default disk, not from the repositories, so \"the most complete set of applications\" doesn't really make sense as a question.\nFor example, if you got an 11.04 Ubuntu disk, you'd get a copy of PiTiVi with it.

Stock Ubuntu broadcom drivers.  Using it now, on my encrypted WPA2 wireless AP.  Don't know if it's going to hang or disconnect.  Ping in a window is checking for long term test.  So far all of about 45 minutes.\nSorry for my long, twisted, post above.  Once I had some confidence in the drivers working on the cli, and determining that the stock GUI wrappers are likely broken, then looking for a new GUI was my conclusion.  Maybe there's consequences to not using the stock network-manager.  YMMV.  Good Luck.\nThanks, Steve\nOne more addition:\nI have another Lenovo Z61t, running Kubuntu 10.04 LTS which uses the ath5k wireless driver.  This wicd fix works fine on that, too.  I'd given up using the stock network-manager widget for connecting to secure wireless connections.  Flaw-less. Just works.  I'm a happy camper.\n", "Q: spell checking and TeXworks When I use TeXworks there is no automatic spell checking.\nIf I go Edit -> Spelling, the only option I have is none\nHow can I enable spell checking?\nThanks for your help\n\nA: There is a section of the TeXWorks manual in which there is the reference to a guide on how to use dictionaries.\nThe link it refers to is this, so you should place your personal dictionaries in the folder /usr/share/myspell/dicts.\nOne easy way to add them is to install them.\nI suppose that if you use LibreOffice then they are installed by default.\nIf not, you can simply install the packages named myspell-XX, where XX stands for your language.\nYou can easily find them with apt-get and auto-completion or via Synaptic.\n\nA: In case you already have LibreOffice installed, the en_US.aff and en_US.dic files are already on your system in the /usr/share/hunspell folder. In this case, just symlink these two files into /usr/share/myspell/dicts and you are done:\nsudo ln -s /usr/share/hunspell/en_US.dic /usr/share/myspell/dicts/\nsudo ln -s /usr/share/hunspell/en_US.aff /usr/share/myspell/dicts/\n\nYou can do so for all dictionaries you find in /usr/share/hunspell.\nRestart Texworks afterwards.\nYou can see Texworks > Edit > Spelling > Unites-States now. Click it.\nAlso change Texworks > Edit > Preferences > Editor > spell-check-language > English-United-States.\nYou are done after restarting.\n\nA: You might have hunspell dictionaries in the language you need already installed. Look for them in the folder /usr/share/hunspell and maybe you don't have to install a thing.\n\nA: I just installed ubuntu 18.04 on an old toshiba laptop. The config file of TeXworks looks for its dictionaries in /usr/share/hunspell. And it is not easy (if possible at all) to change this behaviour. But one can copy (or move) the dictionaries that have been installed. Or download them from Open Office; they will be with oxt extension but these are zip files and making the extension from oxt to zip does the job, then unzip these. You need the *.aff and *.dic files only (plus the rules for hyphenation if any). \nThen you need root access to copy or move these to /usr/share/hunspell. If you have it, just open terminal in the folder where the files are:\nsudo cp  /usr/share/hunspell/filename\nAnd that is it.\nAnother advantage: If you want to switch to TeXstudio then from its config menu you can select the folder where the dictionaries are. So you can select the same. \n", "Q: How to add path of a program to $PATH environment variable? \nPossible Duplicate:\nHow to add a directory to my path? \n\nI need to use a program in my job.

I have a tech newsletter that I'd like to publish through the USC and I was wondering how to do it?\n\nA: http://developer.ubuntu.com/publish/\nThis should get you going...\n\nA: It looks to me like that answer deals with publishing software.  The question asked how to publish a NEWSLETTER, not software.  I, too, would like that question answered.  For example, in Windows, the answer might be MS Publisher.  How about in Ubuntu?  Have I missed something?  Thanks, Fred\n\nA: While it is often used for newsletters, magazines and books, the Ubuntu Software Center is actually designed specifically for software, and does not directly support them.\nI've looked into this myself, and it seems that the only way to publish a newsletter/magazine is to write an application that handles the magazine. In other words, you can do either of the following:\n1) Create a PDF Viewer that handles your newsletters.\n2) You might be able to create a script that automatically loads your newsletter into an existing PDF viewer.\nGood luck.\nPS: Personally, I would like to see Ubuntu get it's own magazine and book store. Something like \"Ubuntu One Bookstore.\" I don't like how a large percentage of the applications published are magazines, and how they clutter search results.\n", "Q: Commands for Installing Unity on Ubuntu Minimal Desktop I want to know what to put in the terminal to install Unity DE on Ubuntu 11.10 minimal.

Docky will now disallow dragging (or removing) icons from the dock, have no way to add items to the dock and have no way of accessing the settings dialog!\nPlease note that some docklets might expose their own settings dialogs/configuration via their popup menus (GMail, Weather, NPR, Clock, etc).

I'm using Ubuntu 11.10.\nI've written a script, that synchronises a directory in ~ with a directory on /dev/sda4, using Unison.

Right now, I want to execute this script at startup, restart and shutdown only.\nThis is what the script looks like:\n#!/bin/bash\nunison -perms 0 -batch \"/mnt/Data/Syncfolder/\" \"/home/myname/Syncfolder/\"\n\nI'd like the script to be run with mechanisms like Upstart, if possible. So I'd be happiest with a properly configured *.conf file in /etc/init.\nThanks in advance.\n\nA: I suggest you forget SysV if possible and use /etc/init new style scripts. Something like this (put it in /etc/init/unison.conf for example):\nstart on (runlevel [06] or local-filesystems)\ntask\n# If it needs to run other than root (you need Upstart 1.4, otherwise use \"su\" on exec line\nsetuid <username>\n\nscript\n  # You can place your entire script here, no need for separate script\n  exec unison -perms 0 -batch \"/mnt/Data/Syncfolder/\" \"/home/myname/Syncfolder/\"\nend script\n\n\nA: After a lot of searching and asking here, I managed to get it working:\nBefore doing the following, make sure that you aren't using unison-gtk (the Unison GUI) as well. I've had a situation in which unison and unison-gtk conflicted. Remove unison-gtk via sudo apt-get remove unison-gtk, and disable Unison's old config files by renaming the containing folder: mv .unison .unison.old\nWhen you've done that, it's time to move on.\nFirst I ran the script as a superuser. I did that because Unison needs to be run once when you create a new script, to make some logging files. The Upstart-scripts are probably run as root, so it's best to do that too when you run the script for the first time:\nsudo su\nunison -perms 0 -batch \"/home/MyName/Syncfolder\" \"/mnt/Data/Syncfolder\" >> /var/log/unison.log\nexit\nThen, I ran: sudo gedit /etc/init/unison.conf.

I noticed it on a new (custom built) machine running 10.04 when that first came out, but then it went away until a few months ago.  I've gone through a number of hard drive changes but I can't say specifically what if anything I changed hardware-wise to make it stop or start happening.  I had assumed upgrading to a modern Ubuntu version would fix the issue, so I installed 12.04 beta on a spare partition last night, but it's still happening.\nHere's the issue.  After grub loads and I select a kernel to boot, the screen goes blank save for a blinking cursor.  It sits in this state for many long minutes before it finally gives up and gives me an initramfs shell with the message gave up waiting for root device (and lists the /dev/disk/by-uuid/... path it was waiting for) but no other specific diagnostic information.\nNow, here's the tricky part.  For one, the problem is intermittent - sometimes it progresses from the blinking cursor to the Ubuntu splash boot screen in a few seconds, and once it gets that far it always continues booting fine.  The really bizarre thing is that I can \"force\" it to \"find\" the root device by repeatedly pressing the space bar and hitting the machine's power button.  If I tap those enough, eventually I will notice the hard drive light coming on, at which point it will always continue the boot process after a few seconds.  Interestingly, if I wait slightly too long before pressing the power button (30s?), as soon as I press it I get the gave up waiting message and the initramfs shell.\nI've tried setting up /etc/fstab (and the grub menu.lst or whatever it's called nowadays)  to use device names (e.g. /dev/sda1) instead of UUIDs, but I get the same effect just with the device name, not UUID, in the error message.\nI should also mention that when I boot to Windows 7, there is no issue.  It boots slowly all the time just by virtue of being Windows, but it never hangs indefinitely.  This would seem to indicate it's a problem in Ubuntu, not the hardware.\nIt's pretty annoying to have to babysit the computer every time it boots.  Any ideas?  I'm at a loss.  Not even sure how to diagnose the issue.  Thanks!\nEDIT:\nHere's some dmesg output from 10.04.  The 15 second gap is where it was doing nothing.

So far, it looks like irqpoll is actually working!  I've booted four times successfully with it so far.\n(As a side note, I can't get irqpoll to stick -- I edited /etc/default/grub to add it to GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT and ran update-grub, but still nothin'.  What am I missing?) (My grub was hosed somehow when installing the other ubuntus.  I fixed it and am seeing irqpoll always now.)\nGiven that, what is the problem here?  It sounds like irqpoll is a hack to get BIOSes that somehow don't adhere to some IRQ standard to work with Linux.  How do I figure out what component is the issue, and is there another solution to get Linux to play nice with it that doesn't involve what sounds like so much overhead?\n\nA: Your latest dmesg messages look interesting.\nI've seen similar press space type problems during booting on one laptop I owned.\nThe solution I found was to add to grub the noapic or the nolapic grub boot parameter.\nThere are a number of grub boot options you can try as per the community wiki:\nhttps://help.ubuntu.com/community/BootOptions\nThus if standard workaround grub boot options such as noapic or acpi=off dont work for you, some of the other common options could work for you.\nWhen testing grub boot option you could use my answer here to temporarily add the kernel options at boot time.\nHow do I set 'nomodeset' after I've already installed Ubuntu?\n\nirqpoll:\n\nfrom the wiki: Changes the way the kernel handles interrupt calls (set it to\n  polling). Can be useful in case of hardware interrupt issues.\n\n  irqpoll         [HW]\n                        When an interrupt is not handled search all handlers\n                        for it. Also check all handlers each timer\n                        interrupt. Intended to get systems with badly broken\n                        firmware running\n\nsource\nThus - and since you have a custom built computer - it is very likely to be one or more components that make up your computer.  To discover which one will require a bit of detective work.  \nThe easiest way would be just to simplify you computer to the basics - use a fixed keyboard, simple mouse, onboard graphics, onboard ethernet and nothing else.  i.e. pull out all the PCI cards/USB components you are using.  Then add each one back in one at a time.\nIf you find that you still need irqpoll on a simplified build - then you'll need to take a closer look at your motherboard.  Look at the manufacturer site and see if there are any firmware updates - most probably you'll need to dos-boot to flash these.\n\nA: It is trying to mount a device. If 'when booting/during GRUB action' you press \"s\" this will skip the mount process, and no errors will appear. You will need to edit the fstab file referencing the UUID number.

I am running Ubuntu 11.10 and I own a Netgear N600 Wireless Dual Band Router with a USB port built into it.  Naturally, the router came with instructions on how to mount and view this drive with both Windows and Mac, but nothing about Linux.  I have an WD Elements 1 TB external HDD that I would like to plug into the router and share across my home network.  However, when I plug it in, absolutely nothing happens on my desktop.  \nI checked on two different machines and nothing seems to indicate that the drive has been mounted (or is even seen at all) on either machine.  I am fully aware that it may not be possible to do this with a Linux system, but I was hoping someone might have a suggestion.\n\nA: I have this same router and just figured out how to access an external drive via Ubuntu.  I wrote a blog post with the details but here's the short version:\n\n\n*\n\n*Install the smbfs package (sudo aptitude install smbfs).\n\n*Create a directory in which to mount your external hard drive (e.g., sudo mkdir /media/public).\n\n*Add a line to the file /etc/fstab (gksudo gedit /etc/fstab) - at the end of the file add this line: //192.168.1.1/USB_Storage /media/public smbfs guest 0 0\n\n*Save your newly updated fstab file then remount your drives (sudo mount -a); you should now be able to see your new external drive at /media/public.\n\n\nA: I have had similar issues with router a year ago. \"roadmr\" has a great potential solution, but there is a slight chance you might be on 192.168.0.1 \nin which case you would enter\nsmb://192.168.0.1    (or other depending on your ip)\n...although the most common would be 192.168.1.1 as \"roadmr\" suggested. \nApologies if you have already tried this, but...\nenter the terminal and type ifconfig.\n\nThis will display your IP information\nI'm fairly new to Linux, but have worked with networks for a bit, so I just wanted to throw it out there to you that 192.168.1.1 might not be your IP, as I set my router to a more ambiguous IP, or I hide the network altogether. \n\nA: Good instructions above to make the disk visible, but however, if you want to make it writable for the user, you have to define it with the uid & gid options in your mount command. To find out the uid (numerical User ID) & gid (numerical group ID) of your user, you can use the command:\nid <user>\n\nThen note the values in uid= and gid= -fields. Once done, you can test it by giving the following command:\nsudo mount -o nosuid,uid=<insert uid here>,gid=<insert gid here> //192.168.1.1/USB_Storage/ /media/public/\n\nIf your disk is now writeable, then you can add the same permissions in the fstab entry:\n//192.168.1.1/USB_Storage/ /media/public/ cifs guest,uid=<insert uid here>,gid=<insert gid here> 0 0\n\nEDIT: Confirming that this works on a hard drive plugged with USB into a D-LINK DIR-868L (ubuntu 14.04). Instead of USB_Storage you should use the device's name, which can be found on web GUI of the router (Setup -> Storage ->Device). Dont forget to check the IP address as well (it may not be 192.168.1.1).\n\nA: Do you know your router's IP address? (usually 192.168.1.1, but it may vary).\nOpen a File Browser (Nautilus) window, then press Ctrl+L and in the location bar that appears type\nsmb://192.168.1.1\n\nthat may give you access to the disk, which is usually published to the network via the SMB protocol.\n\nA: As of 10/23/2012\nYou need CIFS not SAMBA : \n\n\n*\n\n*sudo apt-get install cifs-utils\n\n*Add //192.168.1.1/USB_Storage /media/public cifs guest 0 0 to your /etc/fstab\nI would not have gotten this far without the original answer so thank you.\n\nA: I used smbfs and after compiled it , you will find mount.smbfs under example script mount.\nI am sure you can get that from tar file after you installed binary? I used that command to mount. N600 does not seems to understand cifs. \n", "Q: smbclient getting NT_STATUS_LOGON_FAILURE connecting to Windows box I'm running smbclient on Ubuntu, trying to connect to a Windows box, and I'm getting \"session setup failed: NT_STATUS_LOGON_FAILURE\".\nI've verifed that I can ping the box and telnet to ports 139/445, so I'm pretty sure that it's not a firewall issue.  And my client says that they can connect to this Windows box from another Windows box with the userid/password combination without issue.  Also, this box can connect via smbclient to other Windows boxes that this client has.\nAny other ideas for why this isn't working?\n\nA: Same issue. I had to add users to the Samba password file with\n\nsudo smbpasswd -a \n\nApparently this is because the default configuration in /etc/samba/smb.conf is\n\nsecurity = user\npassdb backend = tdbsam\n\nI’m not using domain controllers or active directory, so I would have thought that access to the regular password file would be the default, but I guess not. It would be nice if that were clear in the documentation I found. The “smbpasswd” reference provided a hint that led to this solution.\n\nA: Have you checked your smb.conf?\nMake sure your workgroup and security settings are properly set.  If you are working with a a computer as part of a domain, authentication requests are first passed through your domain controller, so make sure you have something similiar to:\nsecurity = domain\nworkgroup = WORKGROUP\n\nYou can also use the -W option to specify the workgroup, and add DOMAIN/ before your username to specify the domain:\n$smbclient -L myhost -U DOMAIN/user -W workgroup\n\nHope this helps!\n\nA: I was having the same problem with smbclient, and I noticed that it went away when I manually selected the \"Just Enable File Sharing\" option on the File Sharing dialog you get after manually right-clicking on the folder you want to share.\nIn some Windows machines (like Windows XP) you need to add this to permit remote sharing for non guest users:\nHKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\\SYSTEM\\CurrentControlSet\\Control\\Lsa\\forceguest=dword:0\n\nor, automating using the windows xp command line:\nreg add \"HKLM\\SYSTEM\\CurrentControlSet\\Control\\Lsa\" /v forceguest /t REG_DWORD /d 00000000 /f\n\nAfter that, smbclient worked without any problems with any user.\nMany thanks to jethomas in http://www.techsupportforum.com/forums/f10/enable-file-sharing-via-the-command-line-133562.html\n\nA: On Windows 10 (host) and CentOS 7 (guest) I was able to fix the authentication problem by turning off password protected sharing:\nNetwork and sharing center / Advanced sharing settings / all networks / Password protected sharing\nThis can be helpful for troubleshooting only, I would not recommend keeping it off for everyday use.\n\nA: I got the same problem when I ran\nsmbclient \\\\\\\\[ip]\\\\[sharedresource]\n\nThat command asks me to enter password for a root user, however when I entered the password, I received the NT_STATUS_LOGON_FAILURE error.\nI added -U to specify my remote machine's username and it worked\nsmbclient \\\\\\\\[ip]\\\\[sharedresource] -U [username]\n\n\nA: This may be due to following reason:\n\n\n*\n\n*If valid users is provided in smb.conf cross check the smbpasswd\n\n*Check the hosts file.\n\n", "Q: Managing dependency across Upstart and SysV-style init.d script I have an Upstart job that must run before a SysV-style init.d script runs.\nThe init.d script is configured to be started in the runlevels 2, 3, 4 and 5 with priority 20.\nWhat can I do to have the Upstart job to start earlier than the init.d script?\n\nA: Ubuntu has /etc/init/rc.conf starting on all runlevels. It calls /etc/init.d/rc with new runlevel as parameter. I don't think its possible to time your job to start per init.d script, but if you put your job starting on starting rc or startup, it has the best chances.\n", "Q: How do I encrypt all my hard disk and not only the home directory How do I encrypt all my hard disk and not only the home directory, so it would ask me for a password when it boots and try to mount the hard disk to start Ubuntu?\nI just wanna my system be 100% secure.\n\nA: You need to perform the installation with the alternate CD.\nYou can then perform installation into an encrypted root partition (LUKS) with or without LVM.\nIt is easier to use LVM as you can then use LVM to create multiple partitions (/home , swap) , but only enter a password once when you boot.\nThere is a full graphical walk-through here : http://joernfranz.wordpress.com/2011/01/20/installing-ubuntu-10-10-with-full-disk-encryption/\nWould be nice if someone made such a graphical walk through on the Ubuntu wiki.\n", "Q: How do I access phpMyAdmin?

There's another way, in ubuntu I can make .deb files of the headers and the linux, if I transfer only those two files to the server, I think i can install the new kernel using dpkg. what do you think?\n\nA: If you have another Ubuntu system with the same processor architecture (or with properly set up cross-compiler environment), you can build kernel packages on that system, copy the resulting .deb files to your server and install. An overview of the procedure is available for example in community document Kernel/Compile.\n", "Q: How do I restore my KDE desktop to default? I am a newbie in Linux. I decided to install Kubuntu 11.10 on it and I already have personalized it quite a bit.\nI've also realised that Linux is much more sensitive when you reboot it in comparison to Windows! ;)\nI switched off the laptop once without properly pressing reboot, and since then the buttons and the writing in the windows in the very top seem too big.\nLooks like a bug to me. And if you make the windows smaller it looks really strange and the close and minimize and resize buttons disappear.\nI have already once fixed this by inserting the kubuntu cd, but I've forgotten how I did it.\nI think it was something like restore distribuion or so, but all personalizations kept the same, only the windows were displayed normally (which I of course intended!)\nSo, how can I restore KDE?\n\nA: The above answer didn't work for me.\nI had fiddled with the panels and the solution provided here worked for me. For quick reference, I'm giving the steps below.\n\n  \n*\n  \n*Log out of your kde desktop\n  \n*Open a console session by pressing Ctrl+Alt+F1\n  \n*Give your username and password\n  \n*Run rm -rf .kde/share/config/plasma-*\n  \n*now you can log out of the console session by logout command or pressing Ctrl+D\n  \n*Now go back to your default graphical session by pressing Ctrl+Alt+F7\n  \n*now log in and you will see your fresh new default panels\n  \n\nUpdate for KDE 5\nFor some versions of KDE, first console session (Ctrl+Alt+F1) is used for UI, not the seventh. \nUse second console (Ctrl+Alt+F2) in step 2 \nUse the first console (Ctrl+Alt+F1) in step 6.\n\nA: On KDE Plasma Version 5.9.4 (for Kubuntu 17:04):\nEITHER\nrm ~/.config/plasma-org.kde.plasma.desktop-appletsrc\n\nOR (in order to preserve the old configuration file just in case):\nmv ~/.config/plasma-org.kde.plasma.desktop-appletsrc ~/.config/plasma-org.kde.plasma.desktop-appletsrc-old\n\nThen log out of KDE and log back in.\n\nA: To reset you user's KDE modifications to defaults open a terminal and type\nmv ~/.kde4 ~/.kde4.old\n\nLog off and log back in and all the KDE settings will be recreated fresh.\nThat will move the folder where KDE keeps his settings in to another folder with .old in the end of the name. When you log in KDE will create a new .kde4 folder and all the settings used will be the default.\nIf you want to restore the previous settings you need to have a backup in your home folder inside the .kde4.old folder.\n\nA: This question is quite old but still valid. So, I'm answering it with a solution that applies to current KDE which is KDE5/Plasma.\nJust deleting .kde/share/config/kdeglobals file do the \"reset\" trick. So,\n$ rm .kde/share/config/kdeglobals\n$ logout\n\nThen, just log back in.\n\nA: I had a similar problem.\nI fixed the problem by going on system settings, then to Display and monitor and changing the compositor. This can be done by changing the rendering backend.\n\nA: The Above works in OpenSuSE 13.2 as well and appears to be the best answer for Plasma except there are .kde and .kde4 and .kde5 spaces for 13.2 and I should imagine others there could be the same.  So 4. becomes:\nrm -rf .kde4/share/config/plasma-*\n\nAs always I would recommend copying the three files found this way to an ../old directory first.  Also I would point out the source of the problem is it is incredibly easy to hit the \"x\" in the bottom part of the plasmoid desktop folder so lock your widgets at all times!\nAnother issue is the non-obvious drag and drop you have to hover at the edge of the desktop folder being careful to not hit the x and pull the tab around to pull the desktop folder probably why the folder disappeared.  I agree I cannot find another method documented which strikes me as odd.\n\nA: None of the above worked, including switching the compositor, resetting the compositor, and removing all the config files listed. \nWhat did work for my KDE was to change the theme to something else, confirm the window resize worked, then was able to switch back with resize still working.  \n\nA: For Plasma I did the following, which is better because one can recover from it...\ncd ~/.config; ls *plasma* | xargs -n1 -I% echo mv % %.bak\ncd ~/.cache; ls *plasma* | xargs -n1 -I% echo mv % %.bak\n\n\nA: After I boot up my Kubuntu 18.04, I persistently lost the desktop icon setup to default (all the icons were packed up to the top) that is set up on boot process. \nTo cure this problem, first I recreate icon arrangements on my desktop. \nUsing Konsole, cd to go to default. There is a hidden directory .config. Do cd .config . Then,  I sudo copy the .config/plasma-org.kde.plasma.desktop-appletsrc to something like .config/plasma-org.kde.plasma.desktop-appletsrc.save. This saves the new desktop settings you wanted to preserve (This plasma-org.kde.plasma.desktop-appletsrc is continuously updated as you modify the desktop icons and setup.).\nThen, log out your current user session. Then, without rebooting, login to the same user session. Then, the desktop is restored to what you wanted. Once that plasma-org*.save file was created in .config, you can copy it back anytime whenever you have the same problem to plasma-org.kde.plasma.desktop-appletsrc.\n", "Q: Ubuntu 11.10 as VMware Player guest OS has window redraw issues I'm running Ubuntu 11.10 64bit as a guest OS inside VMware Player 4.0.2 on a Windows 7 64 bit host OS.

Writable disks have an area reserved for calibrating how much power to use for burning (called the OPC area).  The error you are getting means that that drive can't manage to write a test pattern to that area to calibrate itself.  The most common cause of this error is a bad disk, and the second most common cause is a dirty lens in the drive.  Try a different disk from a different section of the package (bad ones tend to show up on top due to higher UV exposure).  If that doesn't work, assuming the drive can still read CDs, go get a cleaning disk and follow its instructions.\nIf the disk you are using is a rewritable medium (CD-R, DVD+/-R, etc) it sometimes happens (especially with CDs) that the OPC area fills up after multiple sessions with only fast blanking.  Running a full erase can sometimes bring the disk back into a usable state.\n\nA: Try Brasero Disc Burner. It's the default program in Ubuntu. I have tried to burn my Audio CD and it has nice and simple-to-use interface. \n\nA: Use k3b. It works fine with 11.10. If you burn Video then use Devede.

Thunderbird auto-finds the login details so if it gets it right you can just copy to Evolution.\n\nA: I got things working on Ubuntu GNOME 16.04.2 using https://outlook.office365.com/EWS/Exchange.asmx as the host url and fetching with my email and password.\nSource:\nhttps://kb.wisc.edu/office365/page.php?id=28462\n\nA: I had a working connection before office365, when the company changed to office365 I had this issue. My connection worked with https://outlook.office365.com/EWS/Exchange.asmx. But most important, before the change I only had to provide the username, so by playing with changing stuff I tried providing username@host.xxx in the Username field and it all started working.\nHTH \n\nA: this article helped me basically you open up gnome settings (after installing evolution) click on exchange and input your login and then click custom. in coustom enter your email again next to username and put \"outlook.office365.com\" next to server. if done correctly gnome and evolution will handle the rest but open up eveloution to chenk it has regesterd there. afer that it is done and your calander should sink up with gnome!\nhttps://kamarada.github.io/en/2017/09/06/use-evolution-to-connect-to-office-365-on-linux/#.XMTV2h-YXza\n", "Q: My Alfa AWUS036NH wireless card autorun installation disk will not run I recently purchased an Alfa AWUS036NH wireless card. The installation is seamless on my windows machines, but the install CD will not run on my linux machines. The wireless card will show up as wlan1 (which is a good thing right?) on my linux machines alongside my wlan0, and I can use it with no problems... but the perplexing thing is i cant get the software to autorun and install. Normally I wouldn't care, but the Alfa Card has a nice GUI for managing available wireless networks, and it would be great to have that GUI on my linux machines like ALFA advertises. (i.e. 'WORKS WITH LINUX!')\nLong story short, when I run the setup.exe, nothing happens, but I am able to view the files through the gui on my optical drive. \nCould it be I need to 'sudo apt-get' something to autorun the software?\nThanks for the help!\n\nA: If the card is already detected and running then the driver for the card is working properly.\nIts a pity that that nice GUI tool that you have on the CD only works in Windows but most likely will be useless in Linux.

So I use regular Unity and I like the panel and the dash but what I don't like is the launcher. I prefer to use Docky with the Magic Lamp effect from Compiz. The problem is when I minimise things, the animation goes to the icon in the launcher which I have set to autohide and the icon peeks out from the side for the animation. It's really annoying. Is there anyway I can stop this or possibly remove the launcher while keeping the Unity Panel and the Dash? Thanks\n\nA: It is not possible to do this really, as the Compiz animations usually use whatever they find first, and not just what is active. Unfortunately there is no way (currently) to disable the launcher, so you may have to live with it, unless you create a custom session  with Unity 2D's panel. The challenge would be activating the Dash without a launcher.\nMaybe you can try Elementary OS's pantheon instead.\n", "Q: Open file dialog defaults to showing hidden files My open file dialog is defaulting to showing hidden files, I have to press Ctrl-H to get to the files I want, but this is not saved across instances of the dialog.\nI can't find a settings panel to change this behaviour, including Nautilus preferences, nor a key in the configuration editor.

I've seen some mice here and all of them mention Windows or Mac. None of them mentions Linux.\nSo, what do you have to say? With the experience you have, do you know if this kind of mouse works normally on Linux (Ubuntu)? Do you recommend any specific brand?\nAnother doubt I have is... When they say \"wifi\" mouse, what is this \"wifi\" exactly? Is it bluetooth or a specific wifi system just for the mouse? All the mice I've seen come with a USB dongle. So, is this dongle a bluetooth adaptor or a specific wifi adaptor just for the mouse itself? I'm asking this because, if this dongle is a bluetooh one, I guess I won't need it because my laptop has a native bluetooth feature.\nThanks for your time, guys. :)\nbrunces\n\nA: I use a Logitech wireless mouse, but I think all of them work with Linux as well as with Windows or Mac.  I think this is one area in which you don't have to worry much about the OS.  (I can't say that they will all work perfectly, but I suspect you'd have a harder time finding one that didn't work.) \nThe dongle is not bluetooth but radio and it works extremely well. I'd guess any of the brands and models will do as well, although I'd recommend a model in which the dongle doesn't stick out very far (so it doesn't get broken or damaged).\n", "Q: Gnome 'Super-#' hotkey like in Unity I've been using unity for a while, and just switched to gnome. (Gnome 3.2 on Ubuntu 11.10)\nI've liked it a lot, but it's missing one key feature (in my mind). In Unity you can use the super button with a number key to open an app on the launcher. For example: Chromium is my second app on the unity launcher, so I can press super-2 to launch it.\nIs there any way to do this in Gnome? Thanks in advance.\n\nA: I want the same thing, and... there's an alternative to that and works pretty well, explained by Mark in his answer here, using xbindkeys & wmctrl.\nJust install them both packages:\nsudo apt-get install xbindkeys\nsudo apt-get install wmctrl\n\nThen create .xbindkeysrc in your home directory and put your desired programs like this:\n\"wmctrl -xa Nautilus || nautilus\"\n    Alt + 1\n\n\"wmctrl -xa Chrome || google-chrome\"\n    Alt + 2\n\n\"wmctrl -xa SublimeText2 || sublime-text-2\"\n    Alt + 3\n\n\"wmctrl -xa Filezilla || filezilla\"\n    Alt + 4\n\n\"wmctrl -xa Firefox || firefox\"\n    Alt + 5\n\nThen log off your account and login back again.\nUsing ALT+# open an instance of the defined program on .xbindkeysrc, or if that app it's already running then the shortcut will focus on that app.\nSadly you have to manually put what programs you need on your .xbindkeysrc file, but it  works superb ;)\n", "Q: Does booting a live USB (with persistence turned off) cause writes to occur to it? I know that Ubuntu will not and can not write to a live CD-R/DVD+-R when it is booting from it, as it is a read-only medium.  However, the procedure (at least on the data level) for running Ubuntu off an optical disc is different from a USB drive, which is usually write-enabled.  if I make a live USB, turn off persistent files, and boot from it, will any data be written to the USB drive (e.g. settings, error logs, temporary files)?  Or will Ubuntu just read from it, nothing else?\n\nA: A live USB acts just like a live CD. Like a live CD, booting is accomplished by extracting a 4 GB filesystem from a highly compressed 700 MB SquashFS image.  SquashFS is read-only, so any data that is \"changed\" in the live session is written to a ramdisk, which (as it's name implies) is kept in RAM and removed on shutdown.\nHowever, you may choose to actually install Ubuntu to a flash drive if you wish.  This will cause Ubuntu to treat it as a hard disk, therefore causing it to write to the drive.  Note that because Ubuntu needs to be installed on a write-enabled filesystem, you will not be able to use SquashFS and will need the full 5GB (as opposed to ~700 MB) of space required by an uncompressed Ubuntu install.\n\nA: I suppose Ubuntu writes data to the USB drive, because it saves the configs we choose. For example, if I install Ubuntu in a computer choosing \"Portuguese\" as language, the next time I start Ubuntu from a live USB it will use \"Portuguese\" as the default language.\nBut I dont know where it writes the data.\n", "Q: With Java being purged from the repo's, what does this mean for Minecraft? \nPossible Duplicate:\nHow can I install Minecraft? \n\nI am running Ubuntu 12.04 Beta 1 LTS on a separate partition on my HD. Now, I read on Web Upd8 awhile back that Oracle had dropped support for Linux, so Java had to be purged from the Repo's. It didn't affect Ubuntu 11.10 as far as I could see, so it didn't bug me at the time. \nNow that I am trying to be a Beta tester for Ubuntu, I noticed that in fact Java was completely gone from the Repo's. Old PPA's weren't recognized, it's not in the software center, etc... anyway, enough dragging this out.

Thanks for any information/help you can provide, if any!\nBye guys! \n\nA: Well, there are two routes you can take with this:\nEither you take open source port of Minecraft, called Minetest-c55. I should warn you though, it's not as full featured in terms of new features added to Minecraft lately.\nOr, you find an unofficial repository for sun-java, which is what Notch recommends for running the real minecraft.\nHowever, you shouldn't - judging by this article - have a problem with this in a default Ubuntu install http://www.omgubuntu.co.uk/2012/01/canonical-reverse-java-uninstall-decision/\n", "Q: Quota format not supported in kernel I'm trying to configure quota for my / mount on Ubuntu 11.10.

I've been planning to switch to Ubuntu as my main OS and I'd like to do it now with Precise. I am a web developer and the only app I am tied to in Windows is Photoshop and IE. The grand plan is to install Windows 7 with Photoshop in Virtualbox. The question is, would it be wise to do so? I've never tried it before and I'd like to ask any professional advice. \n\nA: As I see 12.04 as a tag on your question, I assume you have a good machine box on your hand (some information about this will help to exactly answer your question).\nSo: \nI have a dual-2.3Hz box with 6 GB of RAM (I think at least 2 GB of RAM its important to run good virtualboxs) and:\n\n\n*\n\n*I made the transition Windows->Ubuntu 11.10 (12.04 not stable yet at this moment) very smoothly, so I really reccomend.\n\n*Windows 7 inside a virtualbox runs like a devil. No problem to easy or hard tasks, everything done quickly, no bugs.\n\n*You can have a dual-boot configuration if you insist in having Windows 7 at bare metal level(dumb option, IMHO)\n\n*With Wine, many applications(including Photoshop) runs smoothly too.\n\n\nI advice a Ubuntu 11.10 with virtualbox hanging your windows to avoid little bugs in Photoshop with Wine, but maybe doesn't worse the work to set up. Wine rules too. What you have to leave behind is Windows, without fear, and be happy. After 1st tasty(sooo tasty!-), you'll never come back.\n\nA: I think it is worth the hassle. Like yourself, I switched to Ubuntu from Windows and the only app I really missed was Photoshop. I tried installing Photoshop through Wine first, but it occasionally froze or crashed. Since you can loose hours of work, I think that is not an acceptable solution.\nFor me installing Photoshop through VirtualBox solved those problems, and after a little bit of tweaking the app feels as if it was a native Ubuntu app. I describe how to setup Photoshop on Ubuntu in my blog post How to use Photoshop in Ubuntu.\n\nA: I use Ubuntu as my main OS and do pretty much what you are suggesting, except that I use VMWare Player rather than VirtualBox as I find it easier to configure and it works superbly well. i have been doing this for a couple of years now without any problems\n\nA: im running Photoshop CS 4 with wine, i think it's better than youu use virtualbox...\nSee also this list of Photoshop versions that run with Wine.\n", "Q: Setting up Samba really that easy?

I can also install another Linux distribution alongside Ubuntu which will share the home directory.\nWhen you're installing Ubuntu you can set these partitions up in the partition editor by specifying partitions manually. I've usually assigned 10GB to the root partition and never had any space issues; the swap partition can be up to you but 2GB would be sufficient; the home partition would occupy the remaining space.\nI'm assuming you're not dual booting so please correct me if I'm wrong!\n", "Q: Close gnome session from console I use Ubuntu 11.10 64 bits with Gnome Shell.\nI have opened a bug because sometimes \"Close session\" and \"Shutdown\" buttons doesn't work. gnome-session-quit only works sometimes: bug\nHow can I close the session cleanly from console without gnome-session-quit?\n\nA: The following command is an alternative for the gnome-session-quit (logout) which should close the session cleanly (not killing the gdm):  \ndbus-send --session --type=method_call --print-reply --dest=org.gnome.SessionManager /org/gnome/SessionManager org.gnome.SessionManager.Logout uint32:1.\n(it's one line)\n\nA: That should do it for your 'username' session \n# pkill -KILL -u username\n", "Q: How to reset all NTFS partitions back to default(Read/Write) state?

And one for Ubuntu.\nBut after I installed Ubuntu beside Windows 7, Grub hasn't recognized my Windows 7 install on SSD.\nWhat can I do now to be able to access/boot Windows 7 again?\n\nA: When you installed to the HDD the Ubuntu bootloader was also most likely installed to that same drive. Since your BIOS 'boot order' probably lists the SSD above the HDD, your bootloader (GRUB) isn't part of the boot process. It's there and set correctly, but it's just being skipped when your system checks the Windows drive and finds a boot partition there.  \nYou can either try booting from a live CD/USB and 'repair GRUB' by installing it to the SSD, or change the boot order of the drives in the BIOS.  \nI would try changing the BIOS setting first, that's the easiest.\nEDIT Sorry I just realized I read the question wrong. You can probably still fix things by following the 'repair GRUB' link though. Once you get the Windows entry in GRUB, here is a post explaining how to make it default.\n\nA: Which one is your master drive? HDD or SSD? If SSD is the Master drive than you can use EasyBCD (from NeoWin for Windows 7) to add a linux entry so you can use Windows Boot Menu for accessing the Ubuntu easy way! \n\nA: If you are unsure on how-to's for the methods above, and got plenty of time, you can try to reinstall Ubuntu on your HDD, but using the Manual Partition option, (or as called \"Something Else\" on the setup), then, on the option to \"Select Drive for the bootloader installation, set it on the SSD.

I have set up my /etc/network/interfaces file as stated on https://wiki.ubuntu.com/IPv6#Get_connected_with_Hurricane_Electric.\nMy /etc/network/interfaces file is the following:\nauto lo\niface lo inet loopback\n\nauto he-ipv6\niface he-ipv6 inet6 v4tunnel\n      endpoint 209.51.161.14\n      address  2001:470:1f06:6::2/64\n      netmask  64\n      up ip -6 route add default dev he-ipv6\n      down ip -6 route del default dev he-ipv6\n\nWhen I try to start IPv6 by running sudo ifup he-ipv6, I receive the following:\nadd tunnel sit0 failed: No buffer space available\nFailed to bring up he-ipv6.\n\nI have double checked that the data I entered from Hurricane is correct. What is causing this problem, and how can I fix it?\n\nA: Problem 1: the /64 on the end of the address parameter is incorrect. That's what the netmask parameter is for; you should delete the /64 on the end of address.\nHowever, the error you're seeing is what you'd expect if there was already a tunnel configured with the name \"he-ipv6\". At a guess, you've already run ifup he-ipv6, and it's got as far as creating the tunnel before falling over with an error due to the trailing /64. Try doing\nsudo ip tun del he-ipv6\n\nto delete the half-configured tunnel before trying again.\n\nA: I have configured this option at home too, with Hurricane. It works! but pay attention the following:\n1 - I am using ubuntu 11.10\n2 - I disabled my manual configuration and bridge configuration at /etc/network/interfaces and set eth0 just like \" auto etho / iface eth0 inet dhcp\"\n3 - I have followed the configurations video at Hurricane Website http://ipv6.he.net/presentations.php. The video named \"Tunnelbroker.net Tour & Tunnel Creation\"\n4 - Unless you set the Public Ip of your ISP ( because I don't have a static puclic IP), you need to set YOUR end point IP (LAN) in this parameter \"endpoint 209.51.161.14\", for example.... # ifconfig\neth0 Link encap:Ethernet  Endereço de HW f4:6d:04:d0:db:e3  \n     inet end.: 192.168.25.22  Bcast:192.168.25.255  Masc:255.255.255.0\n\nSo do: \"endpoint 192.168.25.22\"\nI have confgured my ipv6 address like route2...copy the comands and paste in the shell, no in the interfaces configuration file.\n", "Q: How to change Drive Letter?

The safest way to do it is as you've already done, so I think you're in good shape to go further.  However, a bit more information will help: Is Windows on the first partition?  If so, leave it there!  Do not even think about moving or resizing the Windows partition! \nThat is, if I understand correctly what you did.  You installed Linux next to Windows, right?  So you now have two partitions, right?\nIf Windows is in the first partition, the rest is pretty easy.  Using GParted you can create all the remaining partitions.  Is Linux already in a 100 GB partition?  If not, boot from the Linux live CD (or DVD) and choose to try it, not install it.  When you get to the desktop, you can run GParted and resize the Linux partition as you need; do not touch the Windows partition!  If it isn't already there, go ahead and add the Linux swap partition, too.  You can then divide the empty part of the drive as you'd like; if you want to have a partition available to all the OSes, you should probably format that partition with NTFS (to make Windows happy with it), and leave the partition destined for a future installation of OSX unformatted for now.\nRemember, do it all from a Live CD or DVD, and don't mess with the Windows partition at all.  If you do move the Linux partition, you'll probably need to reinstall Grub, but that's easy and instructions are easy to find here in AskUbuntu.com, but it would also be a good idea to boot back into Linux (not from the Live CD or DVD) and use the instructions here to get and install Boot Repair, which can also reinstall Grub if needed.\n\nA: You need to understand all of the following well:\n\n\n*\n\n*Partitions - primary vs logical, file systems, what each OS requires.\n\n*Boot loaders - what they are, how to install/fix them, and what they can/can't boot.\n\n*MBR - just what it is. It comes up a lot when dealing with boot loaders.\n\n\nHow to do it: practice, ...a lot.\nApologies, if that's not what you wanted to hear. The only other way I can think of is paying someone to do it for you.\n\nA: I'm not exactly sure what your current situation is. Is the linux partition 100GB or taking the rest of the disk? Where is the MBR located and are you using grub/lilo to boot? \nNormally, if you think out how many space you need beforehand and for what (as you did) there shouldnt be a problem.

Then inside it, I created a text file called gwibber.indicator with only one line: \n/usr/share/applications/gwibber.desktop\n\nNow log out and back in (or kill and restart the panel) and you should see the broadcast item is gone.\nThe authoritative source for this is here.  It explains how to blacklist items on the messaging menu by using the above procedure.  One thing that is perhaps not explained is how to find the right name to use for the text file (why gwibber.indicator instead of just gwibber for example) and how to find the path to the desktop file.\nTo find the name, you can simply ls /usr/share/indicators/messages/applications.  The desktop path should be like the one for the gwibber example above, but you can ls /usr/share/applications/ to check it's there.  \nTo add your own application to the messaging menu, you need to create a folder: \nmkdir ~/.config/indicators/messages/applications\n\nThen put a text file with the a path to the application's desktop file; I think you can pick any name here.\nReferences:\n\n\n*\n\n*How can I remove \"Set Up Mail\" and other entries from the message indicator?\n", "Q: LibreOffice Calc goes grey takes lots of CPU cycles When working on the Calc (spreadsheet) many time the screen goes grey and CPU cycle shoots up to 100% for a very long time and the app is not responsive.

Please remember that although I am new to this area, I am a do-it your self kind of person, so a lot of work to get what I want doesn't bother me.\nI want a sweet customizable entertainment system. I see there are things out there like MythTV for recording shows. I want to be able to do that, but I also want to be able to access an external hard drive that has digital movies on it, music, photos, and who knows what else. I want to be able to watch internet tv shows and YouTube without the stupid blocks that come on Google TV and Xbox where it won't let you watch some videos. I want it to be networked with other devices in my house and have a home server storing all of this information in one spot so it accessible even without an internet connection. If I can get it to work with lighting and other electronics that would be great.\nPerhaps there are some other things out there that I am not even aware of...as I said, I'm new. I have a LAMP server running on my laptop locally and it was pretty easy to set up. I am working on numerous open source softwares that require that server so I am somewhat familiar with it.\nI am really looking for a cool do it all kind of system that runs through out the whole house, has central storage, and customizable interfaces for each specific job.

I'm able to select between windows and ubuntu when I turn on or reset, but I don't think that there is a real partition anywhere. GParted partition editor is only showing one partition that is being used and the rest as unallocated space. I'd like to get rid of windows.\n\nA: Try re-downloading the file, and using PenDriveLinux to install it from a flash drive. But first make sure your computer can boot from a USB device in the BIOS. Google instructions for your specific motherboard on how to do that. I always install from a flash drive and have never hadma problem. You can also use Ubuntu's Startup Disk Creator* (search in dash) to make a bootable flash drive in Ubuntu.\n*\nUbuntu\nInsert a USB stick with at least 2GB of free space\nOpen the dash and search for Startup Disk Creator\nSelect the Startup Disk Creator to launch the app\nClick 'Other' to choose the downloaded ISO file\nSelect the file and click 'Open'\nSelect the USB stick in the bottom box and click 'Make Startup Disk'\nThat's it! When the process completes, you'll be ready to restart your computer and begin installing Ubuntu.\n\nA: It is impossible because you installed ubuntu inside windows \nit is better to reinstall ubuntu alongside windows instead of installing via wubi\nif you want current ubuntu files try remastersys to to get live dvd image of current system\n\nA: When Ubuntu installer asks for installation type, then select \"erase disk and install ubuntu\"\n\n", "Q: Fry's FR-300 USB Wlan Driver I have been searching all over the internet but I can't find any clues to where I could find a Fry's FR-300 USB Driver. (If it exists)\nWhen I run lsusb The vendor and product # is 07d1:3304.\nI can't find anything for it, and the closest thing I have found is: http://comments.gmane.org/gmane.linux.redhat.fedora.general/388385\nI'm not sure what I'm doing at this point so I can't install the firmware files or driver to test his find yet. Can someone either help me out or link me to somewhere that would explain the process of installing these, or possibly a proven working driver?\n\nA: This reply is not the final answer, just plenty of clues & leads to help you out!\nI have the Fry's FR-300USB adapter inserted, which I cannot use whatsoever. I also have a second, nearly identical USB Wi-Fi adapter inserted. That one works great the moment it is inserted into a USB port. All you have to do after inserting that adapter is just simply enable it under Network Settings.\nI am currently running Ubuntu 12.04, 64-bit version, on a Pentium dual-core based PC with 4 GB of memory and the Intel G33 motherboard chipset. When the Terminal is opened and one types in the lsusb command, the following lines show up:\ncasey@casey-desktop:~$ lsusb\nBus 001 Device 001: ID 1d6b:0002 Linux Foundation 2.0 root hub\nBus 002 Device 001: ID 1d6b:0002 Linux Foundation 2.0 root hub\nBus 003 Device 001: ID 1d6b:0001 Linux Foundation 1.1 root hub\nBus 004 Device 001: ID 1d6b:0001 Linux Foundation 1.1 root hub\nBus 005 Device 001: ID 1d6b:0001 Linux Foundation 1.1 root hub\nBus 006 Device 001: ID 1d6b:0001 Linux Foundation 1.1 root hub\nBus 007 Device 001: ID 1d6b:0001 Linux Foundation 1.1 root hub\nBus 008 Device 001: ID 1d6b:0001 Linux Foundation 1.1 root hub\nBus 005 Device 002: ID 045e:007d Microsoft Corp.

RTL8191SU 802.11n WLAN Adapter\nBus 001 Device 004: ID 07d1:3304 D-Link System\n\nThe last two lines identify the two separate USB Wi-Fi adapters. Both adapters contain the same identical chipset: the RTL8191SU from Realtek Semiconductor Corporation. The drivers are loaded for both adapters and are programmed to recognize the device with the USB ID (shown when one issues the lsusb command in the Terminal) of 0bda:8172. So, now one needs to figure out how to add a patch to the drivers so that the device with the ID code of 07d1:3304 gets recognized the same way.\nThe device that shows an ID of 0bda:8172 when one issues the lsusb in the Terminal gets recognized by the built-in drivers immediately. Just add a simple patch to the drivers already included so that the driver code can treat the hardware device with the ID code of 07d1:3304 exactly the same way.\nOnce that answer gets figured out, anyone with Ubuntu 12.04 should be able to use the Fry's FR-300USB adapter easily.\n\nA: Here's a thread that describes getting it working.  It's not worth copy pasting the chain of emails from the mailing list.  It links to the same page you found.  Essentially it's newer than the standard wireless drivers, but can be supported by tweaking/recompiling some things:\n\nr8712u.ko , which contains support for several chipsets, including the\nRTL8192[SU]_USB.\n\nThe only really significant change from that thread is that the yum line becomes:\n\nsudo apt-get install build-essential linux-headers-`uname -r`\n\n\nA: It's so much easier to just grab install ndis and install from the drivers they provide, a bit easier depending on your're computer situation. hope this helps.\n", "Q: Error in running Python scripts I have python 2.7 installed and I'm facing errors while trying to run scripts in Python.

I'm guessing it has to do with that one can only mount a media and not folders.  Anyhow.  Is there some way to do this?\n\nA: Assuming your C: Windows drive is already mounted under /media/ACER, you can create a symbolic link to the subdirectory you're interested in:\n$ sudo ln -sf /media/ACER/Users/Me/Folder /mnt/Folder\n\nThe -s option tells ln to create a symlink instead of a hard link, and the -f option instructs it to replace /mnt/Folder if it exists, so you won't have to delete it beforehand.\n\nA: You can always mount a drive(aka Paritition, Filesystem) into some folder and not one folder in another.\nSo in this case, you will need to mount your entire C: or D: to your folder.\nIn Linux, this folders are seen as /dev/sda1 or /dev/sdb3 or anything depending upon your drive creation and kinds of devices that you used.\nto know more about your partitions, you can execute fdisk -l\nto know about your already mounted partitions you can do : df -h (h for human readable)\nOne you have identified, which is your correct partition, like is it /dev/sda1 or /dev/sda2 you can mount them in this way:\nsudo mount /dev/sda1 /path/to/your/folder\n\nA: You could create a shared mount point. The advantage over creating a symbolic link would be if you unmount the windows folder this would not leave you with a broken symbolic link which is a security issue. To create a shared mount you first have to \"mark\" the mount point you are using as shared:\nmount --bind /media/ACER/Users/Me/Folder /media/ACER/Users/Me/Folder\nmount --make-shared /media/ACER/Users/Me/Folder\n\nnow bind a duplicate to /mnt like this\nmount --bind  /media/ACER/Users/Me/Folder /mnt/Folder\n\nYou can read more about shared mount points in the red hat documentation you can find it here\nThis should also work for ubuntu i tested it on my debian machine:\nroot@Alucard:~# mount --bind /media/DATENKORB/ /media/DATENKORB/\nroot@Alucard:~# mount --make-shared /media/DATENKORB/\nroot@Alucard:~# mkdir /mnt/DATENKORB\nroot@Alucard:~# mount --bind /media/DATENKORB/ /mnt/DATENKORB/\nroot@Alucard:~# cd /mnt/DATENKORB/\nroot@Alucard:/mnt/DATENKORB# ls\n>> DSC_4988.JPG  _MG_6326.geaendert.JPG\nroot@Alucard:/mnt/DATENKORB# touch test\nroot@Alucard:/mnt/DATENKORB# cd /media/DATENKORB\nroot@Alucard:/media/DATENKORB# ls\n>> DSC_4988.JPG  _MG_6326.geaendert.JPG  test\n\n", "Q: Uninstalling package unrecognized by aptitude Some times ago I installed qtikz on my system, but I don't remember if I did it via dpkg -i --force-architecture or directly from source (perhaps via checkinstall).

It is a great hassle to convert the MBR-partition to UEFI after install and I only succeeded once, by pure luck :-) Trying to recreate what I have done before, I end up having my system completely re-formatted, the ESP-partition included. The installer doesn't take the ESP-partition into account and I end up having a system which still uses the BIOS-legacy mode. \nMy questions are; \n\n\n*\n\n*Should I make an install from my HP backup-DVDs to have the original ESP-partition installed and then install Ubuntu? If so; How can I make the installer \"aware\" of the ESP-partition and to make the installer take it into account to make use of it for Ubuntu?\n\n*Can I create a UEFI-partition from scratch and then install Ubuntu?\nThank you in advance!\nRegards\nEmanuel\n\nA: Thankfully, Ubuntu 12.04 finally fixes the bug that caused earlier versions to trash valid EFI System Partitions (ESPs). Thus, you can install 12.04 (relatively) safely, without undue fear that it will trash your existing EFI boot loader(s). That said, backing up your ESP is a good idea before any OS installation. You can do this in Windows by opening an Administrator terminal and typing \"mountvol S: /S\". This will mount the ESP as S:, so you can back it up. (It's just files on a FAT filesystem; unlike BIOS, EFI doesn't rely on code hidden in boot sectors.)\nTo more directly answer the first part of your first question, I can't say whether you should restore from HP's disks or install Windows in some other way. That's up to you, really, and your choice has more to do with your preferences for what's in your Windows installation than with how Ubuntu will react to it.\nThe second part of your first question is tricky to answer. Ubuntu will boot up in either BIOS mode or in EFI mode, and which one depends on your firmware and the options it provides to control the boot process. Many EFI implementations provide very poor user control over this matter, so it may be a bit hit-or-miss. In a worst-case scenario, though, Ubuntu will install in BIOS mode and you'll be able to convert from that to EFI mode by switching the boot loader. You might be able to force an EFI-mode installation by installing my rEFInd boot manager and booting the Ubuntu installer via rEFInd. (You may want rEFInd or something similar to switch between Windows and Ubuntu once everything's running, so installing it now can be beneficial in the long run.) By default, rEFInd shows only EFI-bootable OSes, including optical disc installers, in its menu, so if you boot the Ubuntu installer via rEFInd, you can be pretty sure it's running in EFI mode. It will then install grub-efi rather than grub-pc, so you shouldn't need to deal with the boot mode after installing.\nYour second question is a little unclear to me. You can certainly partition your disk ahead of time, using either the Master Boot Record (MBR) or GUID Partition Table (GPT) partitioning scheme. You can also create an ESP ahead of time if you like. (In fact, I recommend doing this rather than letting Ubuntu create the ESP; Ubuntu's default ESP is about 1/10 the size it should be! I recommend using an ESP in the 200-500 MiB range.)\n", "Q: Install new programs onto USB stick \nPossible Duplicate:\nHow do I install Ubuntu to a USB key? \n\nHi I have made a working USB stick with Ubuntu 11.10 and I think it's excellent.

I tried to follow the Tips and Tricks of this article, but it does not work. \nAfter typing: \nsudo cryptsetup luksDump /dev/sda5\n\nIt says: \"Device /dev/sd5 doesn't exist or access denied.\"\nI thought the encrypted partition is /dev/sda5.\nAny help how to change the password?\n\nA: The encrypted partition may well be using /dev/sda5 (note the a in sda5) and that is the device you probably need to use (unless that is just a typo in your question).\nHowever the encrypted device itself will have another name - something like /dev/mapper/cryptroot. For the device name you could:\n\n\n*\n\n*look in the file /etc/crypttab - this will have both the partition and the mapper name in it, but only for permanent partitions\n\n*run mount and see what the mapper name is - this is useful when you have plugged in an encrypted disk via USB. (Though I'm not sure how you then find the actual underlying device name).\n\n\nA: On Ubuntu 18.04 run gnome-disks and you can point and click to change the passphrase for the encryption.\n\nA: Download \"Disks\" from Software Manager. Run it. Select your encrypted device partition. Click gear icon. Select \"Change passphrase\". That's it\n\nA: I had issues locating partition name, so created this guide:\n\n\n*\n\n*Locate your LMV partition\n# install jq if you don't have it\nsudo apt-get install jq\n\n# find LVM partition\nLVMPART=$(lsblk -p --json | jq -r '.blockdevices[] | select(.children) | .children[] | select(.children) as $partition | .children[] | select(.type == \"crypt\") | $partition.name')\n\n# check if it was found\necho $LVMPART\n\n    # (optional)\n    # if above output is empty, locate it in a tree view using this command\n    lsblk -p\n\n    # partition `/dev/some_name` should be the parent object of the one with TYPE of `crypt`, set it\n    LVMPART=`/dev/some_name`\n\n\n*Check LVM partition meta by dumping it\nsudo cryptsetup luksDump $LVMPART\n\n\n*Add new key (you can have multiple keys)\nsudo cryptsetup luksAddKey $LVMPART\n\n\n*After dumping it again, you should see multiple keys\nsudo cryptsetup luksDump $LVMPART\n\n\n*Delete old key if desired\nsudo cryptsetup luksRemoveKey $LVMPART\n\n\nA: To see the slots used:\nsudo cryptsetup luksDump /dev/sda5\n\nAnd to find out which partition to use\ncat /etc/crypttab\n\nAnd if it is listed by uuid, use\nls -l /dev/disk/by-uuid/{insert your uuid here}\n\nThen use\nsudo cryptsetup luksAddKey /dev/sda5\nsudo cryptsetup luksRemoveKey /dev/sda5\n\nor\nsudo cryptsetup luksChangeKey /dev/sda5\n\nand for faster reference (assuming only 1 entry in /etc/crypttab)\nsudo cryptsetup luksAddKey /dev/disk/by-uuid/$(cat /etc/crypttab | sed -e \"s|\\(.*\\) UUID=\\(.*\\) none.*|\\2|g\")\nsudo cryptsetup luksChangeKey /dev/disk/by-uuid/$(cat /etc/crypttab | sed -e \"s|\\(.*\\) UUID=\\(.*\\) none.*|\\2|g\")\n\n\nA: Without thinking I set the passphrase to be really long, and it became a pain to type. I ended up using the following to change it to something more manageable.\nsudo cryptsetup luksChangeKey /dev/sda5\n\n\nA: Using the Disks application:\nIn Ubuntu 18.04 or newer there is the possibility of using (Gnome) Disks. Thanks for the hint, Greg Lever, after clicking around I found what Greg mentioned:\n\n*\n\n*Open Gnome Disks.\n\n*Choose/Click on the main physical hard drive in the left panel.\n\n*Click on the LUKS encrypted partition, in this example it is Partition 3:\n\n\n*Click on the edit icon (cogs, gear wheels) and choose \"Change Passphrase\".\n\nIf you get an error, close GNOME Disks and open it in a terminal:  sudo gnome-disks\n(This helped @ScriptAutomate, thank you for the tip.)\nOr using the command-line:\nHere is the answer that worked for me, after Hamish helped me to realize my typo.\nWARNING (for older Ubuntu versions, newer (e.g. 19.04) should be bug-fixed but be careful anyway): If you only have one key and remove it before adding another, you will render your disk inaccessible after rebooting! This also means you can not add a new key anymore afterwards. Thanks waffl and khaimovmr for these helpful comments.\nFirst, you need to find out which is the encrypted LVM partition, it may be sda3, but it can also be sda5 (default on Ubuntu LVM), sdX2, ...:\ncat /etc/crypttab\n\nTo add a new password, use luksAddKey:\nsudo cryptsetup luksAddKey /dev/sda3\n\nTo remove an existing password, use luksRemoveKey, by typing the passphrase to remove:\nsudo cryptsetup luksRemoveKey /dev/sda3\n\nView currently used slots of the encrypted partition (make sure at least one slot is shown):\nsudo cryptsetup luksDump /dev/sda3\n\nCited from this blog. Thanks.\nBe aware: Flimm experienced that Ubuntu's system keyboard layout changed from Dvorak to Qwerty. You cannot see which keyboard layout you are using (bug #1862656) and you cannot choose to display the password (bug #1862654). Also, you only get three tries before being forced to wait for 60 seconds (bug #1862660). Thanks flimm for the helpful comment!\n", "Q: Software center has disappeared I'm an absolute newby for Linux / Ubuntu. Yesterday I installed Ubuntu 11.10 on an old computer. It seemed to work fine. However today when I started the computer again the software center had disappeared!!\nIt wasn't in my starter list. When I used the Dash button it wasn't in my application list.\nIn the Dash center you can also look to applications ready to download and there it was, the software center. But how do I download the software center without software center?\nDouble clicking, right clicking, nothing seems to work.\nHow can I get back the software center, and how do I prevent it from disappearing in the future?\n\nA: Try this worked for me sudo apt install gnome-software\n\nA: The answer given above does work: sudo apt-get install software-center repairs this. However, the questioner asks: how can one avoid this issue in the future?\nIt seems that during installation process, the Software Center may actually uninstall itself -- without giving a clear warning about this. This, then, is a challenge for a future Ubuntu -- that the Software Center is able to give a clear indication whenever key software is about being uninstalled. Here is an example of how it can happen, and by being aware of this issue, one may avoid it. It applies to Ubuntu 64-bit 13.10, at least, and I haven't seen the same for Ubuntu 32-bit.\nWhen you start Wine in Ubuntu 64-bit 13.10, it complains about lack of a proper p11-kit. If you use the Ubuntu Software Center to find a different p11-kit, more suitable for Wine, and install this, out goes the standard p11-kit that it seems that the Ubuntu Software Center itself is using. Thereby, for consistency, the Ubuntu Software Center efficiently uninstalls itself. By re-installing the Ubuntu Software Center, it will switch back the p11-kit. (This is something that only arises if you click on 'Show technical items' and click ahead eagerly.)\nBut the fact that askubuntu.com can search up and answer this question so readily when I needed it shows that askubuntu.com is working really well! :-) Aristo T.\n\nA: First, search for Ubuntu Software in the Dash. \nIf you found it, just drag it to the dock (or starter list ;) )\nIf Software Center doesn't appears, then open the Terminal program, searching in the Dash, and type sudo apt-get install software-center. Press Enter. Type your password (it won't appear anything while you type!), press Enter, press Y when asked and Enter again. When the installer finishes, search again in the Dash, and drop the icon to the Dock.\n\nA: In my case with Ubuntu 22.04, the above answers didn't work, but this command is the one that helped me:\nsudo snap install snap-store\n\n\nA: Just run the following command in a terminal (commonly reachable via Ctrl+Alt+T):\nsudo apt-get install software-center\n\nThe above command will install software-center in your computer. If it ever gets uninstalled or \"disappears\", you can run the command again to install it.\n\nA: I had this problem when I recently upgraded Ubuntu Studio 16.10 to 17.04. I fixed the issue this way. Hopefully it will help the OP, or if it doesn't work with 11.10, I hope it helps anyone else having this issue, and found their way here.\nFirst run the usual update.\nsudo apt-get update\n\nThen the next step is only if the software-center version didn't work.\nsudo apt-get install ubuntu-software\n\nThis should work.\nTo open it from the terminal is straightforward.\nubuntu-software\n\n\nA: I had the same problem in 14.04 LTS (Wubi install): I removed the Ubuntu Software Center icon out of the Classicmenu Indicator, and the Software Center disappeared from the starter. All the configuration data still were in my personal file. Reinstalling it, and draging the icon back to the dock helped for one session, and after a restart it was gone again.\nAll answers here in Ask Ubuntu I checked out did not help, even the ones here at https://help.ubuntu.com/community/PackageManagerTroubleshootingProcedure so thanks to Wubi install I saved all my settings and reinstalled 12.04.05 and upgraded to 14.04 again immediately, hoping this would not happen again.\n\nA: Press alt+f2, enter software-center %u and run this execute this command.\n", "Q: How to disable/disconnect LAN cable during startup How to keep my LAN (Ethernet) connection disabled during startup..\nCoz when I login to system it  is automatically enabled i dont want that due to some security reason.\nWant howto in both ubuntu 10.04 and ubuntu11.10\nRegards,\nDeena\n\nA: That's how it works in 11.10 and it should work similar in 10.04:\nEdit Network Connections:\n\nChoose your LAN connection:\n\nUncheck Connect automatically:\n\n", "Q: How to get rid of Ubuntu's \"no init found\" error message using Windows?

How can I make it unmute automatically so that I don't have to do it manually everytime?\nThanks.\n\nA: You should file a bug report. Instructions here.\nA simple workaround is to add this line into your .profile which will run every time you log on. If you don't want to set it to 50% volume, you can adjust your volume level you want it, and then check to see what it is by running:\nalsa-mixer\n\nThen, to test it out, play some music, and run the next line of code.

Or, if you memorize the first few characters, cd /media/fb0* works too.\nThe only way I know of to change a UUID is to re-format the disk, but it will just result in a different 38-character UUID, so it doesn't solve the problem.\n\nA: You can change the LABELS of the hard drives but when doing so they will have to be unmounted. If you are booted into the system then it is not able to be revised. Recommend using Gparted Live CD because it will do the job an not regress the installed system.\n\nA: When I had faced the same problem, I've also tried to find solution for my question here.

The last time I have been doing this was about three years ago, so I have a lot of pictures to organize.\nAll of the photographs should have correct EXIF tags for the time they were shot. I want to manually add tags for the people appearing in the photos.\nMy requirements are simple. Labels should be stored inside the photos themselves, in the form of IPTC or XMP tags, and it should be easy to do mass tagging, say by selecting a bunch of photos and adding a common tag. Since this task is mostly visual, I'd rather not use command line tools. If possible, I would like to have the timing of the shot copied from EXIF to ITPC or XMP, in order to have all tags in the same format.\nI have been trying to use Shotwell for this, but it is rather annoying. Shotwell wants me to import all the photos before being able to tag them, and this makes it difficult to go folder by folder and tag the pictures. It would be easier for me to tag the pictures beforehand and only then copy them into my main photo folder, which is where Shotwell looks for new pictures.\n\nAre there any good tools to tag photos? I would need something like an EasyTag equivalent.\n\n\nA: I finally settled on phraymd. While a little less polished than shotwell, it allows browsing the pictures in a folder and tag them without importing them.\nI am accepting Tom's answer anyway, since that would work as well even if with a little more care, and shotwell is already there by default.\n\nA: I recently did this with a large photo collection, and I recommend you stay with Shotwell for this. You have to use a few tricks to get what you want though. \nFirst, make sure you set 'Write tags, titles and other metadata to photo files' in Shotwell, like in @Paradiesstaub's comment.  \nIf the folder names are to be used for tagging, say like 'New Year's Eve', then import folders individually and tag that batch, they'll be listed as 'Last Import' at the top left of the Shotwell window.\nOnce you get all your folders imported, tag everyone. Once you have everything tagged, it's already written to the individual files. You can move them around and the tags stay.\nAt this point, you can leave the files in the original folders, or have Shotwell organise them. I chose to have Shotwell organise them by Year and Month sub-folders. To do this, I selected all the files, and exported them from Shotwell to a backup drive. Then, I deleted everything from Shotwell, and re-imported from the backup drive. Now I just import and tag new ones as I go, and Shotwell watches the directory and keeps it organised.\n\nA: F-spot or Shotwell are very popular and can manage photos and create databases. You will be able to edit metadata and folders.\nHowever, importing data form one to the other is not recommended, regression of metadata (tags) will suffer. They do not share the same database format.\nThis is a good comparison between the two: http://ubuntu.paslah.com/photo-management-shotwell-f-spot-and-cheese/\n", "Q: Freshly installed system boots slow - unable to understand kernel messages When my Ubuntu 10.04 PC stopped booting from one day to the next, I assumed that it is a boot loader problem.

I didn't find my solution yet. \nThe solution I seek: I want to enter or edit track titles and album info manually in the GUI before I start ripping. \nI'm using RubyRipper and it has this feature, but RubyRipper is way too slow my current situation. I'm ripping some new audio books I just purchased. They are typically not found the the CDDB and some discs don't show any track titles in the ripping software. So I want to enter this info manually.\nAn alternative solution might be some way to organize the file names after ripping. I'm open to suggestions on that. So far, my attempts to do that have indicated it will be too time consuming and error-prone. So my question is really focused on using the GUI of the ripping software.\nI'm also open to using scripts and command line tools -- but only if it is faster and more efficient. Speed and efficiency count in this task. For example, I'd want to be able to just paste all track titles into a config file, not have to do painstaking editing of a complex command for each CD.\nThe reason why RubyRipper is not appropriate is because the original recording quality is not that great. It sounds like the speaker's microphone is rubbing on paper or maybe his clothing at times. I think this causes RubyRipper problems. Some tracks cannot be \"corrected\" after the maximum trials. \nBut with this poor original quality, I don't care about RubyRipper's efforts at achieving perfection. And I can't seem to set the preferences to completely turn off this matching. (The lowest value is 2 and that's what I've been using.) If I'm ripping classical music, I absolutely want to use RubyRipper (or maybe ABCDE). But for my current 32 CD audio book (and similar situations) neither of those options are appropriate. It took all day to rip just 5 of the 32 CDs from the first of many audio books. At that rate, this project will take months. It should take a day, max.\nEDIT/UPDATE: I'm still looking for the ideal solution. I haven't found it. In the mean time, here's what I'm doing. I'm using Asunder for quick and simple ripping. I'm not editing track names at the ripping stage. Next I'm using Easy Tag to edit the tags as well as track names (and even file names). Easy Tag basically solved my problem, but in a way I hadn't anticipated. Finally, if I need more precise changes to the file names, I'm using \"rename\" on the command line. This is the most efficient approach I have found so far. I'll probably finish this project using this approach.\n\nA: You should definitely check out K3b it's the ultimate disc burning program on Linux. You will have to install some KDE dependencies on Ubuntu though. \nIn the Audio CD ripping you can import CD Text use CDDB or edit tags manually. K3b allows for editing single tracks and whole albums.\n\nA: I found this page on Tom's Hardware that might provide the solution you are looking for. \nSome of the suggested applications on that page are:\n\n  \n*\n  \n*RipperX \nRipperX can rip audio CD tracks into WAV, MP3, OGG, or FLAC files. It uses LAME to encode to MP3, so be sure to also install LAME\n  from your package manager in order to create MP3 files with RipperX.\n  Since ripping and encoding are displayed as two separate processes in\n  this app, you can actually keep the WAV files in the process of\n  creating MP3s. RipperX also allows you to convert directly from a\n  source WAV file to MP3, without a CD at all. Options include bit rate,\n  variable bit rate quality, and encoder priority. ID3 tags, M3U\n  playlists, and album sub-directories can also be created when ripping\n  a CD. File and sub-directory names can be customized to any\n  combination of artist, album, track number, song title, and year.\n  \n*xcfa (X Convert File Audio) \n\n.. Compression, quality, and bit rate for each format are\n  independently customizable. File name format is also customizable, and\n  there is an option to create single CUE files instead of individual\n  tracks. Album covers and tags may also be added and edited. XCFA\n  doubles as a file splitter, allowing for the cropping or removal of\n  track sections. Even tag editing can be done within this application.\n  XCFA is certainly a robust piece of audio file manipulation software,\n  handling pretty much everything there is.\n  \n*Sound Juicer  (called\n  Audio CD\n  extractor)\nExtraction outputs include M4A, FLAC, OGG, MP2, MP3, WAV, and SPX. SoundJuicer not only names ripped tracks to a customizable\n  variation of track number, title, and artist, but also creates\n  appropriate folders in your music directory. This feature is really\n  great for those of us who still prefer old school file/folder\n  organization to the newer tag-based method.\n  \n*Asunder \nAsunder provides a simple interface for ripping tracks from audio\n  CDs and converting them into digital audio files. Supported outputs\n  include WAV, MP3, OGG, FLAC, WavPack, Musepack, Monkey's Audio, and\n  ACC. Each output has a slider for quality, bit rate, and/or\n  compression level. Naming formats of the album directory, playlist\n  file, and file name are each customizable with options for artist,\n  album, track number, year, and song title.\n\n\nA: The sound-juicer package lets you edit track titles before ripping, and tends not to get in my way. Its only drawback might be that it limits your control over the output format parameters.\n\nA: The easy way would be to use the \"Banshee media player\", which also let's you rip CD's and edit all track information as title, album, genre, etc. before ripping.\nIt' rips in the .ogg format using Vorbis at 44100Hz, 160Kbps.\nJust insert the CD, change the track titles to your liking and click \"Import CD\".\nThe default location of the imported (ripped)media will be located in your Music folder.\nFast and easy, all through GUI.\nPS: The speed of the ripping process is greatly affected by the speed/performance of yours PC CD-ROM device. Also, just for the record, Banshee is the default (music) media player in Ubuntu 11.10.\n", "Q: Blank screen but can still hear sounds? \n*\n\n*CPU: AMD K14\n\n*Ram: 4.00 GB DDR3 @ 671MHz (9-9-9-24)\n\n*Motherboard: Quanta 2AC7 (CPU 1)\n\n*Graphics: HP Omni 120 (1600x900@60Hz) AMD Radeon HD 6320 Graphics\n\n\nI am trying to install Ubuntu 11.10 inside Windows.

While browsing i found an interesting tool in sourceforge.net\nit says\n\nMac-on-Linux is a Linux/PPC program that virtualizes MacOS or MacOSX in Linux.\n\nIs it legal? If yes how to install it in Ubuntu?\n\nA: It is definitely a EULA violation. Violating a license agreement is like violating a contract. It gives Apple the right to sue you. Will they? Probably not. As long as you aren't getting in the way of their business. So is it illegal? I would say yes. Is it criminal? No.\nIt's simply a civil contract violation. You have to make up your own mind. Personally, I suggest just getting some Apple hardware because it's great.  \n\nA: Legal or not is a grey area for OSX on non-Apple hardware. I think, for personal use, the most that will happen is that they won't give you tech support\n\nA: It's against the EULA, but in general, each provision of a EULA is treated separately (at least, according to Wikipedia), i.e. so a part of a EULA might be found to be legally non-binding.  The legality depends on where you are, but if you're in the US, I would guess it's illegal because of the DMCA.  Apple sued a clone manufacturer(Psystar) several years ago for selling machines with OS X installed on them.  They sued under several different legal reasons, but one of them was that Apple uses encryption methods protected under the DMCA to keep OS X from being installed on non-Apple hardware.  The court found that indeed the DMCA was violated and Apple won.\n\nA: Mac on Linux works on PowerPC processor. It is not designed to work on x86 processor family. In practice, the question is \"Is it legal to run Mac On Linux\" on old Apple Hardware? Apple stops PPC in 2006 !\n\nA: I have an old PPC iMac, and I tried installing Ubuntu on it.  It sort of worked, but barely, and a lot of programs won't run - even things like Google's Picasa requires an Intel CPU.  Yellow Dog Linux is about the only supporter of Linux on PPC these days, and it's not easy to get it working.\nSo, finding non-Apple PPC hardware, and then getting Ubuntu to run on it would probably be harder than any potential legal battle with Apple.  :)\n", "Q: Printing directly from Flash embedded in HTML page fails I am using the chromium browser to display the following web page:\nhttp://www.primaryworksheets.co.uk/multiws/multi23.html\nI want to print off this maths worksheet for my son, but all I ever get out of my printer is a blank page.

I've just started using Inkscape in Ubuntu 11.10 and I'm not sure what exactly triggers it, but at some point, the Inkscape viewport becomes unresponsive. \nThe viewport is still visible. I can still manipulate the window itself: move, resize, open menu items at top. The cursor switches style. But clicking on anything within the viewport has no effect.\nI must close the file and restart in order to regain control.\n\nA: The problem seems to be related to this bug report: https://bugs.launchpad.net/inkscape/+bug/785701, and the problem seems to be Inkscape trying to access files that are currently unavailable to it (files that may be on network shares or external disks that are currently umounted or disconnected).\nMark Roth's answer on that launchpad page had a good suggestion to run \"strace inkscape\" from the terminal in order to see what happens when Inkscape freezes.  You may find that, rather than restarting the system, you can instead mount the disk with the file Inkscape is having trouble stat-ing then try starting up Inkscape again.\n\nA: What hardware do you have?

It seems not to like .deb packages it does not already have packages for and they chose to not install gdebi by default.  You can get around this by installing gdebi yourself and using it, instead of software center, to install .deb packages.\nFor similar reasons you might choose to also install synaptic which is another package the chose to drop.  Sorry Canonical, many of us are simply not Windows or Macintosh users and we don't like being treated like cattle.\n\nA: The Ubuntu software center has many packaged applications but does have the disadvantage that it cannot install .deb files. However there is another option.\nUsing GDebi to install packages\nGDebi is a simple tool to install .deb files. It has a graphical user interface but can also be used in your terminal. It lets you install local deb packages resolving and installing its dependencies.. It automatically checks packages for their dependencies and will try to download them from the Ubuntu software repositories if possible. You may first need to install GDebi - simply install the gdebi package using one of the package managers listed above, or open a Terminal and type sudo apt-get install gdebi\nOnce you have installed GDebi, use the File Browser to find the package you wish to install. Package files will look similar to this:\n\nDouble-click the package to open it with GDebi. If all dependencies have been met for the selected package, simply click the 'Install package' button to install it. GDebi will warn you if there are unmet dependencies, which means that there's dependencies that aren't resolved in the repositories that you're using - you will have to locate the required packages from some other source.\n", "Q: Is there any way I can increase my home folder size without uninstalling again?

There's a chance you might have some data loss when resizing partitions with data on them, but if it's a fresh install what's to loose? I've used this method to successfully resize a partition with Windows 7 and Ubuntu dual booted HD.

You can then un-mount the drive to be resized if it's mounted, then select it with gparted and choose resize.\n", "Q: Block internet browser from one user I was wondering if there is a way to block the internet tab (applications/internet) from one user.

Previously I was using Tata Docomo (India) as provider, and the Internet was working fine. Now I've changed to BSNL, but I'm unable to connect to the Internet on Ubuntu. However, I've checked access point settings and other configuration which are required for BSNL, and it is working fine with same Dongle on Windows 7. Also, I'm able to connect Internet with other providers on Ubuntu, but problem persists only with Ubuntu. The access point for BSNL in my region is bsnlnet.

I want to find a list of all packages with the Priority: field set to Required.  These are packages that are normally installed on every system, however I've recently discovered that they aren't necessarily installed for foreign architectures using multiarch.  What's the best way to find these packages?\n\nA: With aptitude you can do that type of search.\naptitude search '?priority(required)'\n\nNote that aptitude is no longer installed by default on newer Ubuntu releases, and its man-page is incomplete; you'll find the full documentation as /usr/share/doc/aptitude/README\n\nA: (Disclaimer: this answer uses a low level system tool to solve the requested problem, not aptitude.

You don't own this directory, since it is a system-directory and not a user-directory, like /home/Username, where you can copy/paste files as you wish!\nPlease don't change the root permission of any system-directory permanently, since your system manages on its own and you can only break it that way.

Precise Pangolin (12.04) is a LTS (Long Term Support) release of Ubuntu. Why is Thunderbird 11 included, instead of Thunderbird 10 ESR (Extended Support Release)? \nIs there any way to install Thunderbird 10 ESR on Ubuntu 12.04?\n\nA: Because we use Firefox 11 instead of ESR and most of the same reasons apply to Thunderbird as Firefox for using the rapid release version. The decision to not use ESR by default in the LTS was surprising to me, so I asked on the mailinglists (you can find the thread here: https://lists.ubuntu.com/archives/ubuntu-desktop/2012-February/003672.html) and Jason Warner from Canonical answered: \n\nFirefox adopted a rapid release model for various reasons, but among them\n  was that they needed the browser to keep up with the pace of innovation on\n  the internet. Ubuntu needs to be out in front of these things and be\n  pushing the very edge of what is possible, particularly in the browser. I\n  do not think we can ship a browser that will lag by 12 months in any sense;\n  the risks too far outweigh the rewards.\nI'm afraid that even a year lag (ESR update period) would put Ubuntu at\n  severe disadvantage to other platforms. Imagine a world where G+ or\n  Facebook or some new whizbang product didn't work on Ubuntu because the\n  browser shipped didn't support some new technology/javascript\n  engine/platform component. That is neither something we want nor can\n  afford. We have to be better, we have to be faster and we have to be\n  braver.\n\nAnyway, you'd like to install Thunderbird ESR, you can donwload it here: http://mozilla.org/en-US/thunderbird/organizations/all-esr.html \nYou simply need to extract it into your home folder and add a script called ~/bin/thunderbird \nto launch \n~/thunderbird_folder/thunderbird $@ \nevery time your user calls thunderbird\nYou can also see this blog post from Chris Coulson on why the ESR was not selected.\n", "Q: server needs username and password to logon which is not known i got a used server and don't know the username and password to login. \nAnyone know how i can reset the username and password without needing to wipe everything and starting from scrach?\n\nA: Hold shift at boot, select recovery mode then select root. You can now run:\npasswd foo; reboot\nChange foo for your username, E.g:\npasswd andy; reboot\nYou can low log on as your username with your new password.\n\nA: You could try using something like Kon-Boot to bypass the password (doesn't work on 3.0 or 64-bit kernels). Or, if you have a way to attach the HDD to another Linux machine you can chroot into the server and run passwd [user]\n\nA: It's not difficult, but you probably should consider reinstalling. But if you don't want to, then you simply reboot and select \"Recovery\" from the Grub menu. You'll find an option to get a root shell. Then you'll do\nadduser someusername\nadduser someusername admin\n", "Q: How can I calibrate my colours? I want to calibrate my desktop. I managed to find the colour option in the settings menu, but the calibrate button it's greyed. How to activate it so I can calibrate my colours?\n\n\nA: This button is not for manual calibration. To calibrate a monitor, you need a special device called colorimeter.\nIf you don't own such a device, the best thing you can do, is to do a websearch for available color profiles you can try (try, because not every panel is the same, so someone else's color profile for your monitor might make things even worse).\n", "Q: Small doubts partitions in Ubuntu, please help I have two small questions:\n\n\n*\n\n*I want to erase \"Windows 7 - 64-bit\", by using Ubuntu 10.11 on the entire hard drive, but I don't want to delete my /home/ dir, so is it necessary to delete all partitions or just delete C:\n\n*Furthermore i want to create a swap partition area (my PC has 8GB of ram), so is it necessary to have the same ram in swap, or is 4GB of ram okay? I want to hibernate.\nGreetings and thanks.\n\nA: *\n\n*What? Does your W7 have a /home partition that you want to keep? As a general advice, delete the partitions you don't need, and keep those you do.\n\n*With 8GB of RAM, you most probably don't need a swap partition, unless you plan on using VMs a lot. Anyway, swap can be less then RAM.\n\nA: You will need 9Gb swap if you desire hibernation etc. If you do not then you can easily get away with no swap at all :)\nWhen you reinstall, mark the /home partition for use and mounting AS /home (/home cannot be NTFS based as it causes problems) but mark it to NOT be formatted and it will be added appropriately to /etc/fstab\n", "Q: Eclipse on Ubuntu - multiple installation I need to install 2 version of Eclipse. One for Java and one for PHP. Should I expect that some hidden folder/file is gonna be overridden by both installation?\nI downloaded to standalone installation package from the eclipse download page.\n\nA: Eclipse installation is actually a zip file that can be extracted into some folder of your choice. You may have two Eclipse installed by naming the directories with a different name (e.g. eclipse_java and eclipse_php).\nThere is no problem with that because Eclipse doesn't store anything outside of its directory and the Workspace directory.\n\nA: Typically, you don't need to have separate Eclipse installations for different environments. The persepctive concept is made to switch from different tasks, and you can easily download different plugins.\n", "Q: How do I resize partitions using the simple installation wizard (installing a second Ubuntu)? I'm running 11.10 and installing 12.04 LTS Beta 1 off a DVD. Using the installation wizard, I picked \"Install 12.04 LTS alongside 11.10\".\nI am presented with a slider with approx 240GB on the left side and 60GB on the right. No other labels are present. I don't want to use the advanced partitioning tool. Which side is which Ubuntu?\n\nIf it's relevant: I am installing only for testing purposes (I've been caught by kernel regressions before), so I want to give 12.04 the minimal amount of space required. Once the final release is made, and I've tested that too, my plan is to remove the second partition and upgrade 11.10 to 12.04.\n\nA: When logged in on 11.10, open a terminal (Ctrl+Alt+T) and type the following:\ncat /etc/mtab\n\nThere you will find which partitions are currently mounted. The first is the location of the partition (for instance: /dev/sda2), the second parameter gives you where it is mounted.\nLook for / or /home/.\nWrite down the partitions (/dev/...).\nReboot from the DVD. The partitions you wrote down were used for 11.10, so you don't want to touch that.

I did this in Windows 7. My Documents, Videos, Music and other personal folders are in D:\\ because it is my media disk. \nIn case of a system failure, I will always have access to these files when I reinstall the OS. I just right click, i.e. \"Videos\" in my personal folder (in my case named \"Tesla\") and click \"location\" to set a new location for it, which is in D:\\Tesla and in the case of Videos folder in D:\\Tesla\\Videos. I do that for every personal folder.\nNow, I want to know if this is also possible in Ubuntu 11.10? I would like, when I open my Home folder and click i.e. Videos, to go to /media/Media/Tesla/Videos (which is where my D:\\ disk is mounted), instead of the default /home/tesla/Videos.\nThanks in advance.\n\nEDIT: I already set up NTFS automounting via the NTFS Configuration Tool.\n\nA: This can be accomplished with symlinks. But first, you need to setup your system so that the D: partition is automounted every time you boot Ubuntu.\nRun sudo blkid to see the UUID (Universally Unique Identifier) for all of your partitions. Then you will have to edit your fstab with this information.\nfstab is a file located in /etc/ which determines which drives and partitions should be mounted every time the system starts. Before you do anything else, make a backup of the one you have:\nsudo cp /etc/fstab /etc/fstab.backup\n\nThen, edit fstab (with for example sudo nano or gksu gedit) and add this line:\nUUID=<UUID of your D: partition> /media/Media ntfs defaults 0 0\n\nMake sure that the mount location, /media/Media, exists before doing this, then reboot.\nNow it's time to create symlinks. You will need to remove the personal folders first, as otherwise the symlinks will be placed inside them instead of replacing them. Make sure to backup any files you have there before running these commands:\nrm -rf ~/Videos && ln -s /media/Media/Tesla/Videos ~/Videos\n\nRepeat for all the folders you want to appear in your Home directory.\n\nA: Ubuntu tweak might be helpful (I've never tried it on 11.10 but it works on 10.10) there is a section for Default folder Locations in Ubuntu tweak and you can change the folders, But I think you may need to mount the partitions after each reboot for access files through Home folder :-)\n", "Q: Ubuntu 10.04 doesnt boot \nPossible Duplicate:\nI can't boot into a usable system anymore.

To disassemble, you can use at least objdump -d binary or gdb binary to also run, trace, or modify it on the fly. Gdb has a learning curve, so you could try ddd as a frontend.

The best method is Clonezilla Live. Just boot off the CD and make images on an external hard drive. It's sort of like the Linux equivalent of Ghost. Of course, it's not Ghost; it's entirely different, yet it is also easy to learn and work with, especially in recovery when disks sizes may have changed. It's certainly worth a spin, and learning about it is very useful and enjoyable if you liked it initially. It does not matter what O/S you are trying to backup or restore.\nHave a spare computer that could be used as a server at home or work? The best method is Clonezilla SE. It's far more powerful than Live. With SE, you can PXE boot to the server, pick your image(s), and overwrite everything on your computer - total restoration from a previous date. Or, you can create a zero-troubleshooting environment to cope with the user who has acquired malware that you do not want to deal with for the ten thousandth time: just boot off the network, pick the image, thirty minutes or so later the problem was solved with only about five minutes of your time. It also can multicast an image to same/similar workstation models (chipsets) - even with Windows, drivers and all.

Now go to one line before the end where you can see the words quiet splash; after you put one space and type this:\nacpi_osi=Linux\n\nand then \n\nCtrl+x\n\nor\n\nF10\n\nto save this grub temporary for this time.\nNow it will boot and after a while when you saw the black screen, you hold \n\nFn+Left/Right Arrow\n\nLeft/Right arrows means that [Left or Right]. One of them, I prefer Left.\nYour screen should be back. OK, you login through your username. \nAnd now, if you would like to make it permanently workable but with one more step (Fn+Left/Right Arrows) you have to edit the grub and update it.\nOK, If you like lets do that.\nOpen terminal or hold on (Ctrl+Alt+T) and write this code:\nsudo gedit /etc/default/grub\n\nput your root password.\nOne page will be opened. You go to line 11 [this no is with counting one empty line], where you can see this command:\n\nGRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT=\"quiet splash\"\n\nExactly after the word splash, you add same thing which you add in the grub at past. Add one space and this command:\nacpi_osi=Linux\n\nand save it. Now your line must be like this:\n\nGRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT=\"quiet splash acpi_osi=Linux\"\n\nOK, go back to terminal and see the file is closed.\nNow one thing is remain; you run this code in terminal to update the grub:\nsudo update-grub\n\nput your root password and you are done.\nJust every time that you want to come you have to Hold [Fn+Left/Right] to see your screen.\nI hope this is helpful for you.\n\nA: When the error appears and ask you to choose between recovery mode or others, pick others and press E.

One sata drive has win7 and the other has dual boot ubuntu 10 with XP. Having a dual boot with XP is a pain so I want to add another sata hard drive and move ubuntu 10 to the new drive and delete the ubuntu dual boot from xp so I can choose which drive I want to boot up into. How do I move the ubuntu from the current dual boot drive to the new drive so when I boot up into the xp drive, it only comes up in xp?\n\nA: This is actually more complicated than you might think. The problem is that XP knows nothing at all about other operating systems, and is totally unaware of Linux, and is unable to dual boot it.  So, when Linux is installed with XP, it replaces the Windows boot loader with GRUB, which can dual boot just about anything.  There is an inherent danger here for a novice, which is that the Windows boot loader is no longer present in the Master Boot Record (MBR).  This is the little bit of code that is read on startup, and has only enough intelligence to branch to a more detailed startup program, part of GRUB which is on the Linux partition.\nIf you take away the Linux partition, then Windows will no longer boot.  It's not hard to fix if you know how, but most people do not.  So, the first thing not to do is to delete your Linux partition until you have something to replace it with.  This isn't necessarily a problem, but it's definitely something you want to understand.\nIf you are careful whenever you install Linux on a 2nd drive, you can instruct it to install the boot loader on the 2nd hard drive's MBR, so you can then remove either drive and the other will still boot.  But, that's too late for now, until you replace the Windows boot loader on the 1st drive.  This can be done in a few ways, but some people are simply not capable of doing it for some reason.\nI used to do it using a DOS bootable CD with fdisk on it.  You can usually find and download this.  Then, you can simply boot the CD, and run \"fdisk /mbr\", and this will replace GRUB and make only Windows Bootable.  Another way is to use the Windows XP repair disk and run FIXMBR, or something similar.  I've never done it this way.  You can also find boot disks online that will automatically fix it for you.  I've done this, but I don't remember the site - I'm assuming you can search as easily as me, or maybe someone will fill in some details.\nIn the future, you can possibly disable the Windows drive when you install Linux, to make sure it doesn't get changed again, then when done, enable it.  It's possible the windows drive will get added to the menu in the future, but it will only show up if you boot from the Linux drive, and never will be the default, so it's no big deal.\nMoving Linux is actually much easier than windows, in that it's actuall possible.  :)  \nDo you really need to move it to a new drive?  You can copy the disk by booting from the Live CD, then installing GRUB on the MBR of that drive.  The easiest way to do that is to make a \"System Rescue CD\", which is a free product from http://www.sysresccd.org that can do this sort of thing automatically.  Or, you can install Ubuntu from the CD onto this drive, then copy all the directories to it from the old drive, when booting from a live CD.  Just make sure you copy all files, including hidden files.  It's a little risky, but it's doable.\nThere are several ways to copy a disk; you can do it from gparted using copy and paste, which I've done many times successfully.  You can also just copy your home directories to a new installation, then reinstall any programs, and probably get most all of your settings.  I usually selectively copy a lot of things from an old to a new installation (usually from my home directory, and /etc).\nIf you need more help or details, you'll have to ask.  I don't really know how much you need right now, and I'm not really patient enough for a step by step guide.\n\nA: You need to do two things. Copy your ubuntu installation to the new disk and repair the MBR of the Windows XP disk.\nTo copy your Ubuntu install to the new disk, see How to replace my disk without having to rebuild my Ubuntu install?\nTo restore your Windows XP to boot correctly, you'll have to boot into the Recovery Console. Insert and boot from your Windows XP install CD. Wait until you get to a menu that ask if you want to enter Recovery Console and then press R to do so. It will search and ask which windows installation, choose the Windows XP installation.It will then ask for your administrator password (the same password you use when logging into XP), enter it or just press enter if you don't use a password for XP. Next it should finish booting to a prompt in the recovery console. Once you are at the prompt, type fixmbr and press enter. Once finished remove your XP CD, type exit and press enter. \nSet your bios to boot from that drive and verify it will indeed boot straight to XP. If it does and you have already copied and verified your Ubuntu install on the new drive too, then you can proceed to use gparted (explained in the link to copy your ubuntu install) to edit your partitions on the new drive and XP drive to your liking.\n", "Q: Evolution Mail Client - Not able to send mails from Yahoo Am new to Ubuntu (only 1 day) and trying to fix the issue related to sending mails from Evolution mail client. I have configured Yahoo Mail, and I am able to receive the mails but not able to send. \nI have gone through few posts on this forum, but not able to locate any solution.\nAny help is much appreciated.\nRegards,\nViraj Rao\n\nA: Sending and receiving email are two entirely separate systems.  If you can receive email OK, then you have the POP or IMAP server configured correctly, meaning the port number, login credentials, transport, and the name of the server.\nSo, your problem is with the SMTP server.  There are often more problems with this, partly because of the potential for abuse.  The original specification did not even have any kind of authentication, but along came spammers, and associated problems.\nAnyway, there are now several ways to send mail, assuming the service even allows it - some will force you to use your ISP for outgoing mail, although this is getting rare. \nI don't use Evolution, so I can't tell you step by step how to configure it, but you need to look for either SMTP or outgoing mail server, and enter the information for Yahoo, which according to one search result on Yahoo is:\nOutgoing Server: smtp.mail.yahoo.com\nOutgoing Server (SMTP) port: 465\nAlso, somewhere you need to tell it the server\n requires an encrypted connection (SSL)\nEvolution may require the server and port number to be specified together, as \"smtp.mail.yahoo.com:465\"\n", "Q: problem with halt command to power off I use Ubuntu 11.10. My problem is that I cannot power off the computer with sudo halt command. Ubuntu shutting down screen comes and stops at there (something like the pic below). I waited about 15 minutes which is abnormally long and am obliged to press the power button to shut down. The second try was the same.\n\n\nA: Where is your problem? halt and poweroff are two different things, as explained in the halt manual.\nYou should launch it with\nsudo halt -p\n\nto poweroff it.\nAnyway, from the man halt:\nWhen called with --force or when in runlevel 0 or 6, this tool  invokes\nthe reboot(2) system call itself and directly reboots the system.

Hi can I have a business folder for syncing business files with a remote colleague and a separate personal folder of my own. I don't mind having two accounts. In fact I'd prefer that. \n\nA: I don't think it's designed for that. However, you might be able to accomplish the same thing by sharing folders. I imagine something like this: \nYou first create the business and personal accounts. I don't know if this is permitted, so you'll have to check that. \nYou log into the business account and share a folder with your personal account. Then you log out of that account and into the personal account. You accept the invitation, and then the business account will be synchronized even if the primary account is the personal one. It should work, but I haven't actually tried it. If you do, please provide feedback.  \n", "Q: Where to find/install libpulsecore-1.0.so? Pulse audio problem My skype is crashing silently.

If the bad sectors previously contained data, it's even harder for a recovery tool to repair the damage.\nThe fact that S.M.A.R.T. has failed to diagnose the disk means that there might be even more problems then the bad sectors.\nI know it's not what you were hoping to hear, but I am certain your HDD is gone, with the data on it as well. I really hope you have a back-up on a different disk. As a last resort you can take your disk to a specialized IT shop (there are shops who do diagnose on hardware components as well) and they may try to recover the data.\nGood luck.\nP.S.

All I can say is WOW!  \nBut here's what I want to do:  I have a freind who has a old Dell laptop, not sure if its running Windows XP or Vista; but the O/S is all screwed up.  Now, what I'd like to do is to pretty much give her a \"brand new computer\" in the form of Ubuntu run from a USB flash drive or CD. This would give her full out-of-box functionality of her laptop while at the same time protecting all of her current user files.  \nMy questions: I would assume that using a large capacity USB would be the best way to go for docs, jpgs, mp3, exe's, etc. Would a second USB stick be good for stand alone files?  Exe's would have to be on the drive containing the O/S?\n(I would also assume that in this case the best idea might be to get a full backup HDD; even a solid state drive - but then again, backward compatibility for 7 yr old hardware?)\nSince my own Linux USB is brand new; can I just simply make a copy of the .iso to another USB for her; or would I have to again download the .iso and installer to her possibly corrupted Windows O/S?\nWhat I am seeing is that all she would have to do is to boot into her BIOS, select which O/S she wants to use; in effect a brand new computer for the cost of a USB...\n\nA: The best way to accomplish this will always be a matter of subjective opinion.

I tested with a Western Digital 500 GB v3.0. If you're the only one using this e-HDD, format it to EXT4, that's way better and transfer speed should increase.\nTo benchmark Read/Write rates for your HDD (or EHDD, External Hard Disk Drive), you can use the Disk Utility (Install it, from Software center). You can run it then, from Terminal using the command: gnome-disks (previously known as palimpsest).\nBeware that the Write Benchmark tests require your HDD to be empty.\n\nNote: Use the same files if you benchmark speed between MS Windows and Ubuntu. And use a reliable tool in MS Windows to get accurate transfer speed information (I wouldn't even use the utility provided by the HDD vendor).

You can also see http://pwr.github.io/Solaar/devices.html which is the devices Solaar supports as mentioned in Is Logitech's Unifying receiver supported?\n\nA: Since a few days I use the M600 on Ubuntu 12.04 and... it works. I can click, scroll and whipe.\nHowever, it's not easy to handle, since almost the whole top of the mouse acts like a touchpad, there seems to be a lot of information going lost or are misinterpreted by the mouse-driver.\nLeft clicking for example is almost only possible when your hand and fingers (exept the one that clicks) are completely off the mouse, else it's executed as a right-click.\nHope that there'll be a specially designed driver for it soon!\n\nA: Logitech M600 Just Works!!\nPlugged in the receiver all functions of the mouse work as described on the packaging.  No Problems.

If this does not work, try raising and lowering the refresh rate of your video card in the settings menu as well.\n\nA: These may sound like stupid questions, but I haven't noticed it mentioned in your question: is the monitor CRT or LCD? Was the coworkers monitor that was used in the test of the same brand/model?\nYour description of the effects reminds me of the degauss feature on CRT monitors. If using a CRT, check the built-in monitor menu for an \"auto-degauss\" option, and disable. If using a CRT and find no auto-degauss option, then you may have a short in the power cord that, while unnoticeable, is triggering the power-on degauss function of these monitors. (I'm sure you're not using a CRT, but thought this may be helpful to someone, if people still even use CRTs.)\nSounds like it could be a couple different things. I'd try these fixes in this order to minimize time/money spent. First, lower your monitor resolution for however long it will take to notice if the problem is gone or not, as it may be due to overheating (potentially only happening on external monitor because of the difference in monitor sizes.) Next find out the exact model of video card (is it NVIDIA® NVS 3100M 512MB DDR3?), then completely remove the driver, and install an updated one from the manufacturer. If that doesn't fix it, contact Dell as it seems to be a problem with the laptop, as a little Googling turns up the same problems with that model. If everything else fails, and it's not due to overheating (most likely is) or not still under warranty, then try replacing the power cord for the monitor, as well as assuring all cords are properly attached and without wear. (another rare case is it could be some type of wireless interference, but I doubt it)\nLet me know how it works out.\n", "Q: Help editing GRUB on Ubuntu 12.04  I'm thinking about making a partition to test out Mac OS X on my own computer hard drive and don't think it would suffice if I used it through VM.

Why isn't it included by default? I would like to know what are the drawbacks of using preload? If there would be no downside, preload would be enabled by default, so I guess there are some.\nOkay you need a bit more RAM, but most people have by far more RAM then Ubuntu needs - so what are the downsides of using preload?\n\nA: Simply put, Preload isn't for everyone. It is great if you open applications or libraries a lot. It is harmful if you load applications or libraries only occasionally. I will use two examples from my actual usage (and yes I use preload).\nFirst, Google Chrome. Now a browser is opened only once per boot, maybe twice (for me, I am a web developer). Chrome and its related libraries stay in memory because I am always using it. Even when I close all the chrome windows it's still in the background doing its thing. Thus all the ram dedicated to holding a preload copy of Chrome is a total and utter waste. It's never (or rarely) unloaded. For the average user this is true for a great number of applications. A Office user will almost always have their email app open. So the small savings in startup time is completely wasted because they only open their email app once a day, and leave it open.\nThe Second example is rake. As a ruby developer that believes in testing I run rake a TON. rake runs, executes for a couple of seconds - minutes then exits. Preload helps me speed up my daily work because it loads rake and its needed libraries (which can be very extensive) ahead of time. So there are a lot of starts and stops to the running of rake. The extra ram used to speed up the 400 or 500 launches of rake over the span of a few hours is totally worth it.\nSo the reason it's not enabled by default is because its ability to actually improve performance is based largely on how you use your system. For some people it will be a negative and for others a positive. \nLastly, having preload on, even if you're not using it, consumes ram. So if you're not launching applications frequently, you could actually make your entire system fractionally slower by not having that ram available for other types of caching. Remember, even if you have 32 Gigs of ram Linux will try to use as much of it as it can to cache data to make your interaction faster. By using preload you reduce that free memory some. Even if it is just a little tiny bit, the 2 seconds you saved launching chrome 1 time could cost you 60 seconds over the month it stays running. \n\nA: \nQuestion asked by bountier Saeed Zarinfam on September 5, 2012:\nHi all, I want to know, Is it a myth? Does [preload] really improve my performance? What are drawbacks of using it? I have a laptop with this specification (Core i5 CPU, 4GB RAM, 128GB SSD Hard). Thank you so much.\n\n\n*\n\n*There's no real need for preload if you have an SSD\n\n*\n\n*This is because SSDs provide much faster random access times than hard disks, so \"pre-loading\" binaries/dependencies in memory is a waste, IMO\n\n*The basic downside then is that preload is \"using\" additional memory without providing a tangible benefit.\n\n\n\n\nA: \nPreload is an “adaptive readahead daemon” that runs in the background\nof your system, and observes what programs you use most often, caching\nthem in order to speed up application load time. By using Preload, you\ncan put unused RAM to good work, and improve the overall performance\nof your desktop system.\nDon’t expect to see a drastic change in performance\nright away. Also, if you’re just opening/closing applications\nrepetitively, your computer will store those files in cache anyway\n(this is called a “warm” load), so you won’t see any difference in\nspeed there. You will, however, see a speed improvement if, for\nexample, you use a program intermittently; these programs will start up\nfaster than without Preload.\nPreload can provide a great improvement in application start up time;\nsince most modern machines have a good deal of memory to spare,\nPreload puts this RAM to good use.1\n\nNow that being said, it seems that preload is a great utility, and it might be.\nI think that the reason its not preloaded with the OS, is because the user has to know exactly what there doing, and have enough experience to be able to use it, and the system has to have enough RAM.\nOn a more technical aspect, preload works by moving data from the hard disk to RAM, which makes most hard disk to go to sleep mode if not used, and then have to spin back up when needed.  So spinning up/down the drive, would cause the Load/Unload Cycle count, and the Power-On time count rise, and that will shorten the life of the drive.\n\nWe designed and implemented preload, a Markov-based adaptive\nprefetching scheme that works on application-level predictions.\nMoreover, preload is implemented in the userspace and does not change\nthe application run-time environment in any sense. This is the ﬁrst\nwork experimenting with ﬁle-system prefetching at this level as far as\nwe know.\nOur experimental results show promising improvements on application\nstart-up time compared to cold caches, and a decent hit rate compared\nto a na¨ıve prediction algorithm.\nHowever, being in user-space introduces major obstacles into making\npreload a competitive solution to the startup-time problem. In\nparticular, not having full information about applications’ I/O\nrequests, and lack of strong communication channels with the\npage-cache subsystem degrades preload’s eﬀectiveness drastically,\nespecially under tight memory conditions.\nAnother inherent problem with the preload design is high variance and\nlow prediction conﬁdence caused by the relatively loose correlation of\napplication start-ups. While we successfully build a model to track\napplication correlations, the fact that application launches are very\nrare events compared to the timescale that computers work on, an\napplication-level prefetching scheme is condemned to consume huge\nprefetching memory over practically inﬁnite periods of time. This\nmemory can be used to improve short-term cache behavior.\nFinally, we come up with a set of recommendations for system\ndevelopers on how to improve boot-time, login-time, and application\nstartup-time without falling back to a prefetcher integrated with the\ncache subsystem in the kernel. Of course, a ﬁle-based prefetcher in\nthe kernel can improve on top of that.2\n\n1Source:techthrob\n2Source:Preload - An Adaptive Prefetching Daemon by Behdad Esfahbod - A thesis submitted in conformity with the requirements for the degree of Master of Science - Graduate Department of Computer Science - University of Toronto Copyright (c) 2006 by Behdad Esfahbod.\n\nA: Drawbacks? There are NONE!\nIncreased performance opening applications by the user. I have used it for years on my systems as well as \"read-ahead\" and have no issues. The bug page for preload doesn't suggest any drawbacks either.\nPreload monitors applications that users run, and by analysing this data, predicts what applications users might run, and fetches those binaries and their dependencies into memory for faster startup times.\nIt does increase the boot time slightly however the speed decrease fetching time of applications far exceeds this little issue.\nsee article \nIf you're constantly using common apps like Firefox or Gimp you'll notice some greatly improved load times. Preload is a daemon that runs discretely in the background and will not disrupt your desktop in anyway. Ubuntu users can install preload with:\nsudo apt-get install preload\n\nResults:\n\nref\n\nA: I think that preload does almost nothing. What it seems to do is to load all frequently accessed pages into RAM and locks them there so they stay there.\nThe kernel does almost the same. It keeps dirty pages which are files that were used by a program (or are the program itself). If the program doesn't need those pages anymore, so it closes the file.... python:\nfile=open('file.txt') # open the file\n....\nfile.close            # close the file\n\n.... then the kernel will still keep them in the RAM and only overwrite those dirty pages if the RAM is ...% full.\nPreload only enhances the process but may even slow down the system. It loads applications into RAM but locks them so the kernel cannot release them if the RAM is full. Preload automatically releases them, too, but the kernel has to release the dirty pages before the pages locked by preload are released. Preload has to decide when the locked pages are released and so it can be a waste because if you have the browser opened all the time preload will lock it. Now you close the browser - preload will still lock it. You use all the RAM - preload will still lock it - and the kernel has to release the pages that are required at the moment. Because you don't want to browse anymore, you want to play a game. The game files have to be reloaded all the time because the kernel has to free it's dirty pages.\nI don't know how exactly preload works, how it is learning and how efficient it is, but it would bloat the system for not really anything. Preload can waste RAM. It can waste HDD resources (especially slow down boot I read). The user shall decide if he wants it or not. Preload can help a lot if you're rebooting your system a lot, but if it's in suspend-to-ram often you wont need it. There is no noticeable difference.\nOne thing:\nThe kernel releases the oldest page if the threshold has been reached\nPreload releases the file/page that's the most unnecessary.\nBut as I said: if you don't do what you usually do preload can waste your RAM a lot. Like.. You are not gaming much but coding often. Preload will be a waste when you're gaming but not really when you're coding.\nThat's my view. It may be wrong or correct, keep what you think is good, ignore what you don't like.\n\nA: Here are some drawbacks of Preload and why it is not that effective for everyone\n    I do have a decent specification system with 8GB RAM. So my system is generally fast. Also, I will open heavy memory-consuming applications, such as Firefox, Chrome, VirtualBox, Gimp etc., one or two times per day. They remain open all the time, hence their binaries and libraries are preloaded into memory and occupying the RAM all day. I rarely close and open those applications, so the RAM usage is simply waste.\n    If you’re using modern systems with SSD, Preload is obviously useless. Because SSDs access time is much faster than normal hard drives, so using Preload is pointless.\n    Preload significantly affects the boot time. Because the more applications are preloaded into RAM, the longer it takes to get your system up and running.\nYou will only the see the real difference only if you’re reloading applications a LOT of time per day. So Preload will be ideal for the developers and testers who open and close the applications several times every day.\n", "Q: Thunderbird Default Account whenever I reply or compose a new email in Thunderbird, my personal account sends the email my default.

All I can say is WOW!  \nBut here's what I want to do:  I have a freind who has a old Dell laptop, not sure if its running Xp or Vista; but the O/S is all screwed up.  Now, what I'd like to do is to pretty much give her a \"brand new computer\" in the form of Ubuntu run from a stick or CD. This would give her full out-of-box functionality of her laptop while at the same time protecting all of her crrent user files.  \nMy questions: I would assume that using a good large capacity USB wuld be the best way to go for docs, jpgs, mp3, exe's, etc. Would a second USB stick be good for stand-alone files? Exe's would have to be on the drive containing the O/S?\n(I would also assume that in this case the best idea might be to get a full backup HDD; even a solid state drive - but then again, backward compatibility for 7 yr old hardware?)\nSince my own Linux USB is brand new; can O just simply make a copy of the .iso to another USB for her; or would I have to again download the .iso and its installer directly to her possibly corrupted Windows O/S?\nwhat I am seeing is that all she would have to do is to boot into her BIOS, select which O/S she wants to use; in effect a brand new computer for the cost of a USB...\nAlso; on my own 64 bit win7 system running Ubuntu on an 8GB stick - it seems I can't download exe's?  \n\nA: Don't confuse a proper Ubuntu installation to an ISO made bootable from USB (aka Live USB). The latter is mostly intended for trying/testing Ubuntu before installing, as well as installing (obviously), and could also be used for rescuing files from a system that wouldn't boot. It's not intended for any kind of long term deployment, every day use, programs installation, updating, downloading large files, and so on.\nIn the case of your friend, it would be best to have Ubuntu installed properly to another HDD (could be USB) or the same HDD alongside Windows.\nPS: Ubuntu doesn't use EXEs. :~)\n\nA: I would suggest you take this approach, it is basically a way to save her files and then set up her \"brand new computer\".\n1- Download Ubuntu desktop ISO, but it sounds like you already have that, so step one is done.\n2- Install the ISO to a USB memory drive or stick so it is bootable.  The way to do that is described here.\n3- get another USB memory stick/drive handy\n4- boot from the drive on which you installed the ISO.  Note that you cannot just copy the ISO image to the drive and make it boot, it must be installed.  If the Laptop is too old to boot from USB drive, then use your CD burning software to burn a CD from the ISO image.  Again, it is NOT a CD with the ISO file but a CD that contains the ISO content.  (think of an ISO as a picture of a CD or DVD, you have to reinstall that picture exactly as the original or it won't work).\n5- Once the laptop is booted, use the other drive and copy the files from the hard disk with Windows to the extra drive.  You are now backing up all the user data files.  Be liberal because you will need the backups.\nNow that ALL you files of interest are backed up, install Ubuntu on the HD of the laptop.  You have 2 basic options; 1) wipe the HD and install Clean or 2) Install side by side with windows, which assumes you have enough disk space.\nI suggest you wipe the HD and install clean.  This will delete all the files on the HD which is why you did the backup.  Once the install is done, put the files from the second USB back onto the Ubuntu HD.  Many of the files will open and data available.\nSome files will not open because applications in Windows are different that applications in Ubuntu.  If you were thinking that you would boot Ubuntu and still open user files using the applications installed in Windows, I am sorry to say that will not work as you wish, and sort of doing that is an advanced topic.\nSo I hope you want to save the files and start fresh with Ubuntu.  Many office documents (Word, Excel, Powerpoint) work fine in OpenOffice or LibreOffice (free with Ubuntu), but Outlook .pst files will not open in evolution althought some folks have had good success importing the data.\nI hope this helps.\n", "Q: App service alternative to Adobe Flash Media (Server & Live Encoder) I am looking for an alternative to Adobe Flash Media Server and Adobe Flash Media Live Encoder that can offer on the same hardware better performance, quality and overall performance/stability.

While doing so I was looking through my backup copy and accidentally pressed \"delete\" on one of the folders in the archive.. The computer worked a few hours and then returned error message: file does not exist. when I looked in the drive, my files were gone! The tricky part of the whole thing is this though: even though I can't see the file, it's still taking up space on my external drive, according to gparted. Any idea how to save my data?\n\nA: Never mind. I activated \"view hidden files\" ctrl+h. Here I found 2 folders. One of them contained the backup file. Not strange when I think about it. the files got \"deleted\" with a 4gb usb stick. no way the files would fit in that trash can. :)\nCase closed.\n\nA: Ubuntu uses a \"Recycle Bin\" as well (called Trash). It stored in a hidden folder called .Trash on the root of the drive. To restore the files, go to the Trash icon on the Ubuntu Desktop and restore them from there. This is probably why it's still taking up space. If that's not the issued, try below.\nFile recovery on Ext filesystems is not as easy as in FAT/NTFS systems, you'll need to do a low-level scan of the drive to get the data back. A good tool for this is scalpel as long as it's not something like LZMA data that doesn't have magic numbers. Scalpel reads the drive sector by sector and checks for magic numbers. If it finds one that it recognizes from the scalpel.conf, it extracts it and moves it. However, you'll probably need to hex edit the output to get it back to its original size.\n", "Q: Presenting Power Point slides in dual screen mode I have Ubuntu 11.10 and Wine 1.3 1.3.28. I use my laptop for commercial presentations and it is common to attach it to a projector.\nI would like to use a Presentation Mode in Power Point where in one screen (the projector) the slides are shown, and in the laptop screen beside the slide itself, there are other boxes such as time, notes, and next slides to come.\nBut in order to activate this mode, PowerPoint must be aware of the presence of 2 screens, which is not happening.\nDoes anyone know how to overcome this?\nThanks!\n\nA: This is a known bug, see http://bugs.winehq.org/show_bug.cgi?id=7416 for details.\nEssentially, it's not currently possible at the moment because the functionality for detecting multiple displays is not implemented in WINE.\n\nA: blork explains that this is not supported by wine at this time. Please see his answer.\nThe link he cites notes that you could configure the displays such that the presentation is on the left (or top) and you can see the desktop and other open programs on the display to the right (or bottom) on the other monitor.\nI don't suppose that's entirely satisfactory, but perhaps it's a help.\n\nA: As far as I know, Wine now supports multiple display mods. If there are any difficulties, try to dig in the section in system settings where you can choose how the DE behaves in a multi monitor setup, like open new windows where the current (active) window is, where the cursor is or in a specific monitor, etc.\nIf the problem cannot be solved, it is better to write https://bugs.winehq.org/ with help.\n", "Q: evolution 3.2 not deleting duplicate email account After upgrading Ubuntu 11.04 to 11.10\nI found duplicate mail accounts in the Evolution listing. \nI removed the unwanted ones, both unsubscribing  and deleting them \nfor Preferences/Account.

That Kernel fix the overheating issue of new laptops!\n\nA: Linux 3.2 will be the kernel that ships as the default kernel for 12.04.\nAs with 10.04 the kernels from the next releases (Q,R, and S) will be made available as packages in 12.04. \nIn 10.04 these packages were named something like linux-image-generic-lts-backport-oneiric. For 12.04 they'll be named after whatever animal and will ship whatever kernel from that release is supported. \nSo whatever Linux kernel happens to ship in the Q, R, and S releases will be built for 12.04, put in a PPA similar to what is done here. These kernels will be supported for the life of their respective release, so each one is release is supported for 18 months from their publication, while the stock kernel will be supported the full life (5 years) of 12.04.\nHere's a reference for 10.04:\n\n\n*\n\n*Can I update the kernel of my 10.04 LTS to the latest kernel?\n\nA: From this answer the power regression fix has been backported to the 3.2 kernel that will be used in 12.04.\nFrom the release schedule you can see that 12.04 is already in beta, so the kernel version will not be changing at this point, as that would be a big change that might well introduce regressions.\n\nA: You can install that kernel by yourself.

AFAIK is the maximum primary partitions supported, you could make new partitions inside the Extended partition but it is small so...\nYou would have to delete the swap partition and then shrink the root partition to get space and then make the swap partition again and will need to set the new swap partition in Fstab to be mounted at startup.\n", "Q: How to move a machine from Desktop to Server? In order to make some tests I installed a couple of machines as Ubuntu and Kubuntu (lucid aka 10.04).\nNow the configuration and the tests are completed and I would like to move both of them to Ubuntu server without running the installation media.\nThose machines are in production now (blame on me!) and a re-installation is both impractical and impossible.\nI would expect I can do it by purging/removing a number of packages and by (re)installing another number of packages. Thus keeping the machines online.\nI've found this answer here, but it's not actually saying anything useful to me.\nThe help I need is: which packages I need to purge, remove and install?\n\nA: For major changes you might want to use tasksel - a tool that manages the high level functions of your machine. First install it:\nsudo apt-get install tasksel\n\nThen you can see what tasks are available, and their current status:\nsudo tasksel --list-tasks\n\nTo remove the desktop packages you will need to run commands not through the desktop. So if you could ssh in from another computer. Or if you are in front of the computer you could get a non-desktop terminal by pressing Ctrl-Alt-F1. Then you can do:\nsudo tasksel remove ubuntu-desktop kubuntu-desktop\n\nIf you've already set up your server stuff (web server etc) you're done - and sounds like you are. But for others who might not be, or if you want to add extra stuff you can still add other services using tasksel. So you might choose to do:\nsudo tasksel install server openssh-server lamp-server\n\nWhich would ensure you can get in via ssh and install the Apache web server, the MySQl database server and PHP.\nIf you want more information about the exact packages you could do:\ntasksel --task-packages server\n\nwhich would give you a list of packages the server task will install.\n", "Q: crontab command not run I'm trying to get execute a cron job everyday at noon but i can't get it to run.

Dropbox is currently running well on Ubuntu server 10.04. \nHow can I setup dropbox to log any sync in syslog or even separate log file?\n\nA: You can get some kind of logging by listening to .dropbox/iface_socket. Where .dropbox is the default folder of the dropbox daemon (not client). iface_socket is what the client (open source) and the server (closed source) uses to communicate. Note than I talking about the local client (cli, nautilus-plugin, etc) and local server, not the one that is run on the net by Dropbox.\nYou can find a ruby script to read this socket here, but I was not able to check it.\nI'm not sure if this will give you the info that you want, but this is the best that I can think of short of making a feature request to the dropbox developers.\n\nA: I came across this post looking for an alternative to show the dropbox log files. I know it's not the same, but I believe it can be useful for troubleshooting.  Using the script provided by the dropbox, you can create a script starting on your /etc/rc.local redirecting the output to a specific log file with the following command:\nnohup find $HOME/Dropbox -type f -exec dropbox filestatus -a '{}' \\; > /var/log/dropbox.log 2>&1\n\n\nA: Now I understand the question properly, I think you should be using rsync to do your syncing (and produce proper log files) rather than Dropbox.

I'd probably also try the lightweight Xubuntu and Lubuntu.\n\nA: Ubuntu is a bit heavy for it, but as htorque said it will run. Perhaps use Unity 2D instead of 3D for better performance though. Xubuntu is a great, easy alternative however, it's lightweight, fast and nice looking as well. \n\nA: I have an Intel atom 1.8G with 4G RAM and xubuntu 64 bitruns flawlessly.

This set-up was certainly workable on this machine. Nonetheless, there was always about 10 to 12% CPU activity when running only htop. After working a while with this desktop you start to notice it is subtly sluggish, up to the point of provoking a headache.\nXubuntu LTS 12.04 32-bit\nThis is why I decided to try also Xubuntu 12.04 32-bit. I also upgraded XFCE to 4.10 from a PPA. The result is an extremely snappy desktop. Only 3 to 5% CPU activity when idling on htop and CPU fan use is noticeably less. All this results in a full four hours of off the grid computing on this ageing 6-cell 10.8V 4.36Ah battery. In spite of my fears, all screen elements and menus are fully visible on this small 1024 by 576 pixel screen.

For example current Oneiric will be supported till April 2013. What does that mean and what happens by that time? If a bug is found in one of Ubuntu supported packages - will it be fixed? \nI'm asking because I'm experiencing serious known problems with Compiz and Unity which make it completly unusable for me (bug #888039 + few other minor ones). Fixes have been released in Precise branch although Launchpad's status says it affects Oneiric (It's confusing too, but maybe I don't know the process well enough). Migrating to Precise is not an option for now and I just wonder if I can expect such fixes to be backported to previous - still supported version if for some reason I wouldn't like to upgrade to latest version. \nI know it's hard to generalize but just wanted to know what can I expect from \"supported\" version.\n\nA: The promise that a certain version of Ubuntu will be supported for a specific number of mounths does not necessarily mean a promise to fix all bugs or even a promise to fix any bugs.\nNote this quote from the Ubuntu web page for Desktop business users.\n\nStay up-to-date with free and regular updates and upgrades\n\nSee the graph called Ubuntu for Desktop Release Cycle. Notice that the next two LTS releases will get 2 years support for Hardware and Maintenance Updates and a further 3 year support for Maintenance Updates. That may include bug fixes but it does not imply a promise to fix all bugs during that period.\nIt is similar for the server LTS versions as this page for Ubuntu server business users  shows. The main difference is that Hardware and Maintenance Updates extend for the full 5 year period.\nAs the link in your question to a bug report shows, it is often very difficult to determine exactly what package is causing the problem and we can also see that a lot of effort by volunteers is put into sorting out bug reports to determine which should have priority and who is responsible for fixing it.\nWhen I read this page on helping with bugs I see that the Ubuntu development community is reacting to bug reports in a very orderly way.\nYou need to also consider that Ubuntu is a distribution. It takes software components from other parts of the Linux community and brings them together. What if the bug is in the Linux kernel, or Debian, or Gnome or some other component that Ubuntu does not have responsibility for.\nThe bug report has to be pushed to those responsible for maintaining and developing the package that has the bug. And it is then up to those people.\nSometimes the Ubuntu people can provide the fix as well as the bug report. It is important that the fix gets pushed upstream (as it is called) then all in the Linux community can benefit and not just us Ubuntu users. It takes time for the fix to go upstream, be accepted by those upstream maintainers, and come back downstream to be patched into Ubuntu.\nI am not surprised that sometimes a decision is made to fix the problem in the next to be released version of Ubuntu rather than fix it in a version that is soon to be superseded. Especially if that next version is to be an LTS version with 5 year support.\nYou say that that particular bug is being fixed in Precise Pangolin but not in Oneiric Ocelot. But Precise Pangolin 12.04 has been under test for almost six months. By putting the fix into Precise, the fix gets tested.\nThis is better than putting it into Oneiric for users expecting a stable release to test it out, do you not think?\nFixing the past can wait. Get the future \"precise\" at the start. That is what is important, in my opinion.\n\nA: \nFor example current Oneiric will be supported till April 2013. What\n  does that mean and what happens by that time?\n\nIt mainly means that technical support concerning Oneiric version will be provided until its end of life, that is April 2013. You can also be sure that critical and security bugs affecting Oneiric will be fixed until April 2013. \n\nIf a bug is found in one of Ubuntu supported packages - will it be\n  fixed?\n\nDepending on the severity of the bugs and the packages affected by the bug, it may or may not be fixed. \n\nA: There is no guaranty that if a bug is found it will be fixed. Period. Even on the current or development version. Some bugs are fixed, some not, it depends on available resources, bug severity, etc...\nWhat is sure if that a bug is fixed, and it is a security or critical one, it will be back-ported to all supported versions. Also, in some supported versions, you will receive updates to some selected packages (like firefox) until its end-of-live.\nThe most important thing about support, from a normal user point of view, is that the repositories of any versions will remain online only as long as it is supported. If you are using an unsupported Ubuntu version you won't be able to install or update software using the normal means (apt-get with official repositories, Software Center, etc...).\n\nA: Others have well addressed what it means to be supported.\nIf there's a fix in Precise you need in an older release like Oneiric there are three possibilities.\n\n\n*\n\n*You can follow the process for Stable Release Updates. If a fix is important and unlikely to break anything it is a candidate for a SRU. See here. The link also gives important background concerning why bugs are not automatically fixed in older releases of packages. \nI see a fix for the bug you mentioned is going through the SRU process for Oneiric. You may want to comment on the bug report asking about its status. I'm surprised that it has been in testing for as long as it has.\n\n*In general, it is possible that a newer version of a package with the fix has been released to oneiric-backports. You can enable that repository opening the Ubuntu Software Center and using Edit->Software Sources and then clicking the Updates tab. Select oneiric-backports.\n\n*Again, generally speaking, you may be able to use the Precise version on your system if Oneiric has all of the dependencies of the package's new version. You can navigate on archives.ubuntu.com through the pool tree of directories to the current package for each supported release. You can download the one you want, check to see if all of its dependencies are met, and then try to install it with the sudo dpkg -i package_name_and_release command. A web search may also be helpful to find the .deb file for the version you want. This is very unlikely to work for Compiz or Unity, because there's so much change in their dependencies from release to release.\n\nIn your specific case you mention, I think the SRU process was the most appropriate and indeed a fix is following that process. The fix proposed is in the oneiric-proposed repository and you can install and test it from there.

Mine says \"Powersave\".\nThere's another Tab for Power Profiles.\nOn that tab, I click on \"Powersave\" and it brings up a panel with all the actions that the system will take when this profile is activated including what to do if the notebook lid is closed.\nWhile you're there, check out the rest of your Power management settings and set them to your preferences.\nPersonally, I don't like sleep and hibernation, so I set all of them to do nothing or shutdown.\n", "Q: How to enable UPnP coherence plugin in rhythmbox 2.95? In Ubuntu 10.10 I was using the rhythmbox-plugin-coherence package and I was happy to stream music from Rhythmbox to our internet radio box.

No I tried, using the Converter from VMware, to convert smaller physical servers to virtual servers.\nUnfortunately, thats not easy. First, I got the problem that the converter does not suport Grub2, so I had to boot from the iso in order to fix the bootloader. Afterwards, I could boot into grub, but grub told me he can not find the root-disk UUIDxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx. I can see the problem (UUID of hard drives have changed), but not the solution (tried root=/dev/sda1 instead of root=UUIDxxxxxxxxxxxxxx).\nDoes anyone have successfully converted a 11.10 to virtual, and if yes: how to I fix this problem, and how many other problems will I have to face afterwards?\nthanks\n\nA: I was able to figure out how to do the reverse of this and go from a VirtualDisk to a hard disk (with the help of SuperUser, and the reverse of this should work.\nFirst, DD your hard drive to a file while booted from a separate drive (say, booted in Live mode on your Ubuntu install disk). The file will be the size of the hard disk, but will be smaller later. For now, you need to create it onto a larger drive - sorry. (For instance, DD a 500GB hard disk onto an external hard disk with at least 500GB free). You could also try using GParted to shrink the partition with Ubuntu on it to around the max size you want your virtual drive to be.\nFor instance, the command would be sudo dd if=/dev/hda of=/media/ExternalHardDisk/rawimage.img or replace /dev/hda with /dev/hda1 for just the partition.This assumes that your hard disk is at /dev/hda (and the partition you want is /dev/hda1), which can be checked using the Disk Utility (palimpsest in the terminal) or in GParted while booted there, and that you mounted your external drive as /media/ExternalHardDisk/ (probably replace ExternalHardDisk.) DO NOT run these commands without first checking what drives are what on your currently booted system - they may change between when you are started in Ubuntu from your hard drive and when you start GParted or your Ubuntu live CD.\nFrom here, our procedures may differ slightly. I use Sun (Oracle) VirtualBox, so I would use the VBoxManage command in the terminal to clone rawimage.img to a vdi image with VBoxManage convertfromraw /media/ExternalHardDisk/rawimage.img ~/virtualbox_image.vdi --format VDI. You could also try formatting to VMDK or VHD and changing the extension accordingly if any of these will work better for you. I can't help you from here, sadly, but VMWare should at least be able to import one of these or the raw image we created earlier. Or, \"Just create a new virtual machine, and when the wizard gets to the step for hard drive(s), just say \"use existing\" instead of \"create new\", and point to the vmdk file you have.\"\n\nA: I followed almost 1:1 those steps here: http://communities.vmware.com/message/1576443#1576443\nThis way, I was successful.\n", "Q: Partitioning of Ubuntu 10.04 server on KVM? I am installing Ubuntu 10.04 server on a KVM virtual machine. The server will be used to install Zimbra mail server, which installs under /opt/zimbra. As Zimbra is being used, it needs more storage. I decided to put /opt on a separate partition, so that I can resize that partition later on if needed. \nI first did a test install with guided partition and ended up with a 254.8 MB for /boot and 1.5 GB for swap. So I think those are good numbers to use in my manual partition and I ended up with the following partition:\nSCSI1 (0,0,0) (sda) - 34.4 GB ATA QEMU HARDDISK\n    #1   primary   254.8 MB   f   ext2   /boot\n    #5   logical   1.5 GB     f   swap   swap\n    #6   logical   8.0 GB     f   ext4   /\n    #7   logical   24.6 GB    f   ext3   /opt\n\n/opt is set to ext3, because Zimbra installation requires a ext3 file system. My question is if this partition works well with a mail server. If not, any suggestions or advice?\n\nA: Looks good to me. \nSome remarks...\n\n\n*\n\n*The 8.0 Gb root is more than we use on our servers.\n\n*Zimbra uses MySQL. MySQL by default stores it databases in /etc/ so that might be a caveat. From the specifications I assume they store it in /opt/zimbra so that might be taken care of by them. \n\n", "Q: How can I know how long `dd` cloning will take? I have to dd a couple of 1TB hard drives. They are taking several hours to clone and I was wondering if there was any way possible of knowing how fast they are going, how much they have done and how long will they take to copy the rest.\nAll I can see is the terminal with the command running. When I run ps -e at least I know that dd is working from the CPU usage shown, but I have no way of knowing how much it has done or how long it will take to finish.\nKind of makes me crazy.\n\nA: There is already another extended dd called dcfldd that do many funny stuff as this you are asking for http://dcfldd.sourceforge.net/\n\n\n*\n\n*sudo apt-get install dcfldd\n\n*Instead of dd you write dcfldd\n\nA: Typical. When I ask something I then find the answer somehow (even if I looked for hours.. but magically I find it AFTER creating the question -.- ). Anyway for what I checked with dd --help which mentions at the end of the help (I can't really believe I did not see THAT) the following:\nSending a USR1 signal to a running `dd' process makes it\nprint I/O statistics to standard error and then resume copying.\n\n   $ dd if=/dev/zero of=/dev/null& pid=$!\n   $ kill -USR1 $pid; sleep 1; kill $pid\n   18335302+0 records in\n   18335302+0 records out\n   9387674624 bytes (9.4 GB) copied, 34.6279 seconds, 271 MB/s\n\nWhat this means is that in another terminal you would run the following line using the Process ID of the DD you want to check. For example in my case is Process Id 4112. You can see the process ID by typing ps -e and looking for dd or just ps -e|grep dd and looking at the number in the front. Take note of that number and then type in another terminal window kill -USR1 4112; sleep 1; This will give me the time, seconds elapsed since it began and how much is has copied. At least now I know it takes about 8 hours to copy 1TB of information at about 40MB/s.\n\nA: Use the program pv for any piped stream to see a live report of data transfered. It can be used for any application using pipes. It is also a great tool for seeing rate of transfer to things like USB, External disks, networked computers.\ndd if=infile | pv > outfile\n\nOr for direct copying, just use this:\npv infile > outfile\n\nExample:\nsudo pv /dev/sda1 > /home/user/sda1.ext4.img\n\n\nA: Regarding using kill to display info on a Mac, you have to pass it the -INFO flag instead of the -USR1 flag. And remember that it shows the info in the terminal where your dd process is running, so if you open a new tab to type kill -INFO $PID (where $PID is the number you found using ps -e | grep dd), you'll have to switch back to the tab where dd is running to see the output.\nNow if only I could figure out how to display that output as GB or MB instead of plain bytes...\n", "Q: How to set default encoding for non UTF encoded documents system wide?

It keeps on giving me \"permission denied\". I know the password is correct because I reset it via LISH, and I know I've got the login method right because I've logged into my server before using the exact same commands. I sure hope this doesn't turn out to be some noob issue, or I'm going to be quite frustrated. \n\nA: You need to run ssh (the client, and possibly the server) with more verbosity to understand why authentication is failing.  For the client, run\nssh -vvv username@host \n\nOn the server end, check the logs. /var/log/auth.log will give you a pretty good idea about what happens when you try to login, look for messages that contain sshd.  There are a variety of reasons why authentication could be failing, ranging from simple (you aren't using the right username) to more complicated (sshd is configured to use the wrong authentication system).\n\nA: in my case our IT department had setup PAM stuff with rules that broke my login.\nfollowed @pestilence 's reply to see error, ended up commenting out AllowGroups in /etc/ssh/sshd_config, which was setup to some IT stuff:\nUsePAM yes\n#AllowGroups <some IT groups>\n\n\n\nA: I had the same incident, I tried all solutions above and they didn't help, the final cause was because i tried to change my shell to fish using chsh.\nI had console access to the machine, so i made tail -f /var/log/auth.log, so i found the error message user is invalid because shell /bin/fish is not found.\nI was also unable to run chsh again because of the same login issue, so i made a symlink from /bin/fish to /bin/sh, and i was able to log in immediately.\n\nA: Try using a different port.

At work, I have a proxy set on many files/applications.\nIn /apt/apt/apt.conf I have Acquire::http::Proxy \"http://myproxy.example.com:8888\" set.\nIn /etc/wgetrc I have:\nhttps_proxy = myproxy.example.com:8888\nhttp_proxy = myproxy.example.com:8888\nftp_proxy = myproxy.example.com:8888\nuse_proxy = on\n\nIn /etc/environment I have:\nhttp_proxy=\"http://myproxy.example.com:8888\"\nhttps_proxy=\"https://myproxy.example.com:8888\"\n\nAnd in my network and proxy settings I have HTTP, Secure HTTP, FTP proxies set up as well.\nSo as you can see, I have proxies set up just about everywhere!\nWhen I'm at home though, this all becomes an annoyance, because I have the go into every file and comment out the proxy settings. Do you know of an app/script to quick disable the proxy settings in all of these files and then quickly re-enable all of them?\nFurthermore, do I need to have all these proxy settings in all of these files, could I reduce them?\n\nA: If you are running in a graphical run level then using the default Ubuntu network manager should set the proxy settings for everything. At Uni I used to set the proxy in Gnome's network manager and the proxy settings would then be set for terminal sessions (as an example). There may even be the ability to set 'Locations' nowadays (but I don't use Ubuntu so I can say for certain).\nDebian also has the ability to specify different locations (and therefore settings) using scripts under /etc/networking/. See here though the docs state that the old ifup and ifplugd scripts are deprecated. I assume the same would apply to Ubuntu.\nI believe at the command line, just setting the http_proxy/https_proxy environment variables should be sufficient. wget will read proxy info from there, you don't need to set it in the wgetrc file.\n\nA: i'm in a similar situation here, which not only requires me to turn on and off proxy settings, but sometimes to use a different proxy in another location.\nwhat i do is install squid on my machine (any other proxy capable of using parent proxies can do), and then, point all my applications to this local proxy on my own computer.\ni keep a configuration file for squid that uses the internet directly, and a config that lets squid use a parent proxy for each proxy i am required to use.\nseen the benefit yet? when i move to another location, i don't have to touch the proxy settings of any of my programs, i just change one file, the one belonging to squid, and reload squid. i name the config files easyily-identifiable names, and the switching goes something like this:\ncd /etc/squid\nsudo cp squid.conf.work1 squid.conf\nsudo service squid reload\n\nthe config that lets squid use direct net is \"squid.conf.direct\" for me.\nhope this helps :)\n", "Q: PNP4Nagios error with Apache I had a working setup with PNP4Nagios and Nagios.

I need to make an application in Vala, using Gtk, that supports keyboard accelerators that can be changed by the user. \nFirst, I add an entry to the global Gtk.AccelMap and then set the accel_path for the Gtk.MenuItems. But, it doesn't work. The accels don't appear in the items of the menubar.\nTo clear what I'm trying to do, here is a sample code:\n// main.vala\npublic class MyWindow: Gtk.Window {\n    public MyWindow() {\n    this.set_default_size(500, 500);\n\n    var main_box = new Gtk.VBox(false, 0);\n    this.add(main_box);\n\n    // Menubar\n    var menubar = new Gtk.MenuBar();\n    main_box.pack_start(menubar, false, false, 0);\n\n    var file = new Gtk.MenuItem.with_label(\"File\");\n    menubar.add(file);\n\n    var file_menu = new Gtk.Menu();\n    file.set_submenu(file_menu);\n\n    var quit_mi = new Gtk.MenuItem.with_label(\"Quit\");\n    file_menu.append(quit_mi);\n\n    // Register a new accelerator with the global accelerator map\n    Gtk.AccelMap.add_entry(\"<MyWindow>/File/Quit\", 'Q', Gdk.ModifierType.CONTROL_MASK);\n    quit_mi.set_accel_path(\"<MyWindow>/File/Quit\");\n\n    // Connect signals\n    quit_mi.activate.connect(Gtk.main_quit);\n\n    // Label\n    var label = new Gtk.Label(\"My Window\");\n    main_box.pack_start(label, true, true, 0);\n\n    this.destroy.connect(Gtk.main_quit);\n    }\n}\n\nint main(string[] args) {\n    Gtk.init(ref args);\n\n    var win = new MyWindow();\n    win.show_all();\n\n    Gtk.main();\n    return 0;\n}\n\nI use:\nvalac main.vala -o main --pkg gtk+-3.0\n\nto compile the source code.\nSo, the question is: what's missing in the code? I think I need to do something else, but I don't know what.\n\nA: Could you please clarify whether you want mnemonics (keyboard shortcuts for gui widgets i.e. ctrl-q) or accelerators (keyboard shortcuts for activating menu items i.e. alt-f q). As far as I understand these are two different things, so setting a mnemonic for a menu item will not also form a accelerator for it.\nIn any case, for the accelerators you can form them by simply creating your menu items with a different function: Gtk.MenuItem.with_mnemonic(\"_File\"); in stead of Gtk.MenuItem.with_label(\"File\"). It is then re-definable with e.g. the file.set_label('Fil_e') function\nFor the mnemonics, I'm not exactly sure why it doesn't work, as I'm totally new to vala. But I was able to piggy bag of of this c-example and get it to work using accelerator groups in stead of the accelerator map. So I replaced\n// Register a new accelerator with the global accelerator map\nGtk.AccelMap.add_entry(\"<MyWindow>/File/Quit\", 'Q', Gdk.ModifierType.CONTROL_MASK);\nquit_mi.set_accel_path(\"<MyWindow>/File/Quit\");enter code here\n\nwith \nvar accel_group = new Gtk.AccelGroup();\nthis.add_accel_group(accel_group);\nquit_mi.add_accelerator(\"activate\", accel_group, 'R', Gdk.ModifierType.CONTROL_MASK, Gtk.AccelFlags.VISIBLE);\n\nand that seems to do the trick.\nI hope it helps.\nRegards TLE\n", "Q: How can I use Cygwin under Ubuntu? I have written a tiny application for Ubuntu, and it works great. I am interested in cross-compiling it for Windows.\nI have installed mingw32 from repository, and it compiles simple files very well. However, the app I want to compile for Windows uses some UNIX specific mechanism - for example it makes use of the sys/socket.h file, and the mingw compiler claims it can't find it.\nOne solution is to install Cygwin on a Windows machine, and try compiling the application from there, using Cygwin executables. Unfortunately, I don't have access to any Windows machine, as I don't own a copy that system. It would be perfect if I somehow could use Cygwin (with it's libraries and headers) on my Ubuntu to compile an .exe file.\nThere is no package with it in the repositories. Can anyone give me some on how to use Cygwin on Ubuntu?\n\nA: Cygwin is a windows program that allows you to run linux programs in windows, so it wouldn't make any sense to have it in the repositories.\nI suspect your only chance of having this work would be to run cygwin in wine.  \nIt sounds like you have two separate questions:\n\n\n*\n\n*Can I use run Cygwin under Ubuntu to test the windows version I'm trying to build?\n\n*How do I find windows libraries to use with mingw32 to replace the linux libraries I've been using?\n\n\nAs I said above, for 1, yes, you should be able to run cygwin in wine for testing.\nQuestions 2 is unrelated and should be moved to a different question.  (For what it's worth, I have no idea about the answer to 2).\n\nA: Have you tried wine?\nAnyway, you can use Virtual Box and 90-day Trial Windows 7, but only if your application is not comercial ;)\n\nA: The Cygwin cross-compilers are available on Fedora/EPEL using a custom repo (Copr) – https://copr.fedorainfracloud.org/coprs/yselkowitz/cygwin – so in principle it should be possible to run it on Ubuntu too. I don't know if you can install Fedora/EPEL cygwin on Ubuntu and if it would work (you could try converting the RPM to a deb using alien and installing that). Otherwise, you could study the RPM spec files for hints on how to build it from source on Ubuntu.\nNote that Cygwin has three parts – a toolchain, the runtime DLL, and ported packages. The runtime DLL and the ported packages won't work under Linux unless you use Wine, and given the limitations of Wine's emulation of the Windows API may not work reliably (depending on exactly what you are using them for). The toolchain can be compiled for Linux as a cross-compiler, and then you can use it to compile Cygwin executables from Linux. This may be useful if you have a Linux-only CI environment, if you have plenty of Linux hosts and a shortage of Windows hosts, etc. (Trying to run the toolchain under Wine may work, although last time I tried to run Cygwin executables under Wine it complained I was using the wrong cygwin1.dll version for my Windows version – maybe using a newer Wine may fix that.)\nAnyway, I managed to install Fedora 33 in a chroot on Ubuntu 19.10, and then install and run the Cygwin toolchain in that Fedora chroot – see the following script. Note this doesn't work on Ubuntu 20.04 or later due to the removal of yum in Ubuntu 20.04. Probably there is a less hacky way, like using a Fedora Docker container, or trying to use Alien to install the Fedora RPMs on Ubuntu directly.\nAcknowledgement: parts of below script were lifted from this answer\n#!/bin/bash\nset -xue\n\n# Script to install Fedora 33 in a chroot on Ubuntu\n# And then in turn install cygwin64-gcc in that chroot\n# Finally we test we can compile a .exe with Cygwin\n#\n# Run this as root\n#\n# Works on Ubuntu 19.10\n\n# Configuration\nfedoraver=33\nchroot=/fedora${fedoraver}\nrpminst=/tmp/rpminst\nserver=https://download.fedoraproject.org\nserverpath=pub/fedora/linux/releases/${fedoraver}/Everything/x86_64/os/Packages/f\nserverfile=fedora-repos-${fedoraver}-1.noarch.rpm\n\n# Install yum and yumdownloader\napt install -y yum yum-utils\n\n# Create our chroot\nmkdir -p $chroot\n\n# Download and install the fedora-repos package\nwget $server/$serverpath/$serverfile\nrpm -i --nodeps --force --root=$chroot $serverfile\n\n# Ubuntu's RPM is too old for python-pip-wheel package\n# So says YUM.

I wanted to install Ubuntu and dual boot with Windows 7. When i tried to do this, I accidentally deleted my windows partition altogether.\nI got the recover disks from Acer, but when I tried to restore the partition, it told me it ran out of space.\nHere's my partition table. I would like recommendations. I obviously am not going to be cavalier at this point about deleting partitions, but I did clonezilla my drive off and I will again before doing anything too destructive.\nMy thoughts are to create one big unallocated space outside the secondary partition, but I'm not sure why the extended partition's divided up as it is.\nAll advice appreciated.\n\nA: You should have used testdisk to restore your old partition, but since it looks like it's already been reformatted, that idea goes out the window.\nThis probably has to do with the fact that Windows is being installed on an extended partition. By default it'd be in a primary partition. What you could try doing is deleting the partition called /dev/sdb7 and resize \"extended\" to just fit just the Linux partitions. That should leave you with\n/dev/sda1 = ntfs\nFreespace\n/dev/sda2 = extended\n/dev/sda5 = linux-swap\n/dev/sda6 = ext4\nThen try installing Windows again using the free space as its partition.\nIf that doesn't work, do this:\n\n\n*\n\n*Delete all partitions (either from Windows partitioner or Gparted from LiveCD).\n\n*Install Windows 7 like usual, but leave some space for Ubuntu.\n\n*Install Ubuntu from a LiveCD or LiveUSB.\n\n\nThis is kind of a last-resort type answer, but I think it'll save you a lot of headache if you do so.\nSince it seems like your computer is pretty fresh (not a lot of backups needed, if any) I'd do this. If you do have anything you'd like to backup, be sure you do so before doing this.\n\nA: If you want to completely remove Ubuntu and restore Windows as your OS, I would simply delete /dev/sda2 altogether and create an NTFS partition to fill up the remaining space on the drive.\nIf you still want a dual-boot system, create the NTFS partition for Windows and, but leave some unallocated space after for Ubuntu to install itself in.\nRestore Windows to the NTFS partition, and then you will be free to install Ubuntu afterwards if you choose to do so.\n\nA: The Acer recovery disc reinstall Windows but in a special way in order to have the less interaction with the user and to preinstall all the programs that were bundled in it.\nDue to it's automatic way, it can't install windows in some schemes, even if you have the free disk space.\nIn order to reinstall Windows you have two choices :\n\n\n*\n\n*Use Acer recovery disk\n\n*Look for a genuine microsoft windows 7 with the exact same language and edition (some friend of yours must have one ....)\n\n\nFor the part 1 :\n\n\n*\n\n*Backup your personal Data (windows partitions and Linux partitions)\n\n*Run Ubuntu Live CD and install gparted\n\n*Remove every single partition on the disk (ntfs, ext4, extented, ...)\n\n*Proceed with the acer disk\n\n*Proceed with ubuntu installation\n\n\nFor the part 2 :\n - Backup your personal Data (windows partitions and Linux partitions)\n - Run gparted and delete both ntfs and shrink the extended partition in order to leave 0Mb free inside it and everything outside.\n - Proceed with the Windows disk and put your licence that is hidden below or below the battery\n - Proceed with the Ubuntu Live for repairing the dual boot\n - Done, you kept at least your ubuntu intact instead of deleting eveything\nBest regards,\n", "Q: is it necessary to delete the recovery partition? I have Windows 7 on my HP laptop and I want to install Ubuntu.\nI tried to shrink my boot and system partition, it does not allow me to shrink the partition more than 97 MB. Is it necessary to delete the recovery partition? \nI want to know how to put this recovery on a CD or DVD to keep it and not to lose it. \n\nA: If you want your windows 7 operational you must not touch that partition.\nIf you simply remove it then your windows 7 won't boot ....\nIf you remove it carefully you'll be unable to use the recovery tools afterwards.\nYou can't backup that partition in order to deport it for later use on CD.\nYou Have various choices :\n\n\n*\n\n*Removing the partition carefully understanding that I'll disable you some features of windows such as : bitlocker and recovery tools. And you understand too that you can loose all your windows install. There is no guarantee you'll be able to run windows 7 after this procedure : http://itcookbook.net/blog/removing-windows-7-recovery-partition\n\n*Re install Windows 7 so that it does not create the recovery partition ... Witch is safer way to do it : Create an NTFS partition that fit all the hard drive with gparted on ubuntu live, install windows and say yes when it ask you for creating supplementary partitions. After the installation of windows install your ubuntu with shrinking the windows partition.\n\n*Last option : shrink the windows partition, leave recovery partition as it is and install ubuntu.\n\n\nBest regards,\n\nA: Usually there's a tool on the Windows desktop that facilitates the creation of recovery CDs, it will drive the cd burner program etc, prompt for extra blanks. Just read your documentation or visit your vendor's support page. Also, it's a good idea to test these discs before you wipe out that partition. If it were me, I would leave the recovery partition alone and shrink the windows partition instead.\n\nA: You might consider using Clonezilla live CD http://clonezilla.org/clonezilla-live.php\nTo copy that \"recovery\" partition to DVD then safely remove the partition without worries. \n\nA: I know this is a old post but I have seen Windows not let you shrink very much like you said. Can't shrink more than 97 MB. A lot of the time this is due to your system needing a defrag. Most often a defrag will fix this issue. \nIf you want to back up your HD, try Trinity Rescue Kit. It has features that will let you clone your hard drive even over a network or you can use any number of drive cloners to make a complete copy of your hard drive. \nI hope this helps the next person who has this issue. \n", "Q: Desktop widget to show list of tasks In Unity Ubuntu 11.10 how I can have a screenlet with a list of tasks to do?\nFor example:\n1- Update system.\n2- Check mailbox.\nand so on.\nThanks in advance.\n\nA: The TODO Screenlet sounds like what you are looking for.\n\nAdditional information and a download link can be found on its gnome-look.org page.

One example is that i use putty's commandline tool plink.exe to telnet/ssh remote machine from java program.  \nNow when i switch to ubuntu, for that there is a utility sshpass that does the same for me. Now the problem is sshpass is not already installed and before it is installed, my program will not work.  \nIn windows, if something is not there, i can package portable executable in my program e.g this plink.exe and use it at run time to do the job. Now in ubuntu, i want to know is there any way that i package .exe like file, which i can simply call with arguments to perform similar tasks??  \nBasically i want to know is there anyway in ubuntu to run a file without having to install it?? if so how is it possible??\n\nA: In linux, as in windows, you can compile any program with all it's dependencies linked as static files. But the difference that in Linux this is not the usual way to do things.\nThe Linux-way is to install each program just once, if you need to use shhpass, you shouldn't bundle it with your software, but you should list it as a dependency in your installation package (i.e. deb file for Ubuntu). The package manage will fetch and install when it's installing your program.\nThere are a couple of reasons for this behavior, from efficiency (use of shared memory) to security (your can ship a security bug with your bundled program). As everything this approach has also its drawbacks, mainly the need for a centralized place to install software, but the important point to your answer is how things are, not how things could be.\nThe short answer is yes, you can do it, but it will be difficult. You'd be fighting against the culture and design of unix-like OS. You will likely need to compile your own versions of every program that you want to bundle, and most packagers and user are not going to like it.\n\nA: The idiomatic approach on Ubuntu would be to give out, not your raw program, but a .deb package containing your program and also listing it's dependencies. Then, installing your package will automatically install any missing dependencies (assuming they're available from the standard sources).\nThere is some documentation here on creating packages.\nThe alternative, more windows-y (and even somewhat OSX-y) approach, is to bundle statically-linked builds of all your dependencies with your app, and unpack them into a temporary directory from where you run them.\nYou can use a tool like makeself to do this: put all the executables you need, plus your jars and a suitable start script in a directory, and it will do the rest.\n\nA: Under linux, any file can be executed (so long as you have the privileges). From your java program, you can call any .exe file that you package with it. \nYou probably need to make sure that the .exe file is executable under linux though. Some if not most of .exe are specific to one operating system. For example, putty's website only provide source code for unix that needs to be compiled into an executable (http://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/putty/download.html). For windows the executable is already compiled, but probably not runnable under linux/unix.\n", "Q: Why is git not using my pubkey with crontab? To backup my sql database I have a cron job running that makes a mysql dump.\nNow I want to create another cron job that commits this dump to the repo, the problem now is that it doesn't work.\nIn the cron log I see the line where the command gets run but nothing is committed.\nSHELL=/bin/bash\nPATH=/sbin:/bin:/usr/sbin:/usr/bin:/usr/local/bin\nMAILTO=root\nHOME=/\n\n49 16 * * * cd /path/to/backup/folder/ && /usr/local/bin/git commit -am \"Updating DB backup\"\n\nThis is what I put in crontab -e. I also tried this in /etc/crontab, where I put root as user and that works but only as root user which is a problem because of the git post-commit hook that does push after something is commited. Since only my user is allowed to push this doesn't work when root doest the commit.\nSince its working with the root user I'm thinking it's a permissions problem, but permissions of what? These commands work in normal command line.\nWhen catching the stdout and stderr I get the following in the log. \nPermission denied (publickey).^M\nfatal: The remote end hung up unexpectedly\n\nso it doesn't really runs as my user or can't find the key? \n\nA: The format for your cron file (which is what you get when you type crontab -e) is different from the system cron file.  You don't need to specify user in the user cron file, it is automatically run as you. Try:\n49 16 * * * cd /path/to/backup/folder/ && /usr/local/bin/git commit -am \"Updating DB backup\"\n\nI would also suggest catching stdout and stderr so that you can actually see what the commit has done, for example:\n49 16 * * * cd /path/to/backup/folder/ && /usr/local/bin/git commit -am \"Updating DB backup\" >> /path/to/logfile 2>&1\n\nEdited to add: Now that you've shown the output from stdout/stderr, the problem is clear.  ssh is not finding your keys, which is likely due to you setting\nHOME=/\n\nIt should probably be something like\nHOME=/home/me\n\nAlternatively, you could probably just leave it unset.\n\nA: You probably are setting the crontab using another user that not you. Check if you are doing \"sudo crontab -e\" and try just \"crontab -e\" with your user or whoever is the owner of the git and files. \nThis sorted me out so maybe it will work for you too.\n", "Q: How can I easily install missing hplip dependencies? Having installed HPLIP on my 10.10 system, the HP Photosmart 420 gives \"Device Communication Error\" code 5012 when I try to print. Running hp-check lists 11 missing dependencies. Do I have to install them all one by one or is there an easier way to get the printer going?

When it prompted to print a test page I did so without hope but the \"Stupid Old Black printer\" started to print :) \n\nA: If you know what the needed packages are, you can simply run the usual sudo apt-get install in a terminal, followed by the names of the packages required.\n\nA: I also had this problem. The way for this to work is to install the hplip toolbox from the software center. Then sudo hp-toolbox and then you should be able to install the correct plugin.

After testing Ubuntu 11.10 (64 bit) by booting it from the CD, I unfortunately decided to install it on my pc. On my pc I had kept on each hd and the ssd as well space enough for other partitions. I used the offered option to install Ubuntu alongside with Win7 and ... ended up in a half destroyed system. Everything seemed to work well during the installation, but after reboot I got the mess.\nDuring boot it does not ask me which OS I would like to choose, as it was said in the installation routine. It always boots Windows, but the Windows partition on drive d: (30% of the disk) is gone and Win7(64) instead reports a RAW partition with the the entire capacity of around 500GB. My drive C: (SSD) and Drive E:(HD) seem to be ok though. But D: was my win program drive and so my win7 installation is nearly unusable.\nIs there a way to revert the installation and get my partition on drive D. back ?\n\nA: When you do an \"alongside Windows\" install, the installer resizes the first partition and sticks a new one in after it for Ubuntu. That's what happened and that's why your \"C\" drive is smaller.\nFurthermore, Windows uses a thoroughly broken logical approach to drive naming. So if you insert another partition into a system (as has happened here), Windows doesn't have a clue what to do. I'll stop raging on the inadequacies of Windows and let you read this:\n\n\n*\n\n*http://windows.microsoft.com/en-GB/windows-vista/Change-add-or-remove-a-drive-letter\nYou can manually change the letter assigned to a partition. Do that and fix your \"programs drive\" back to D. That should fix Windows for you.\nAfter that, \n\n\n*\n\n*If you still want to use Ubuntu you can try fixing the Grub bootloader which doesn't appear to have detected the right disk to install its bootloader onto. You have a non-standard setup so you might find that just changing the boot priority of the system in your BIOS will fix that.\n\n*If you don't, nuke that partition (you can do that from Windows or the LiveCD) and resize your C drive back up. This will probably play havoc with your D drive again, but you can fix that.\n\nA: after installing this on my pc as a longside windows 8 i think we need to re thik the grub boot manger so it shows up windows installations as well as linux Ubuntu as ive noticed it delets the windows boot mgr and this causes windows to start as the windows os looks for its own boot mgr to work\nbut to the question above there isent at the moment which makes Ubuntu rubbish you will have to reinstall windows all over again but with out wiping the hard drive so you have all your files from windows \n\n\n*\n\n*put your dvd/cd in to the drive press del f8 f10 f12 which ever it is to get in to bios \n\n*select the dvd drive to boot first and press any key when its prompts you \n\n*on windows 7 select your language  then click next it will give you 3 options i would select option 3 as this might fix windows with out reinstalling it click on repair windows click on advance and click on automatic repair windows it should work if it dont then that will tell you will deffently need to reinstall so back to square 1 click on install windows click on advance it will come in a white windows with a load of hard drives depending on how many you have in your system, select the hard drive you want dont click on anything else it will install windows with all the files intact once windows is installed you can delete Ubuntu from the hard in the system registry  i know its long winded but its what i have to do but i am going for my new hard drive in put Ubunty on and install windows on my ssd \n\n", "Q: Network Administrating Software (Similar to ClearOS) I am looking for a network administrating software that is similar to the ClearOS in this link: http://www.clearfoundation.com/Software/screenshots.html\nOf course the software should be for Ubuntu or work in Ubuntu but offer similar features as the administrative panels in ClearOS.\nIs there a network administrative software similar to this in Ubuntu.\n\nA: Webmin is very nice http://webmin.com/demo.html\nwebmin wiki http://doxfer.webmin.com/Webmin\nyou can add third-party modules too\n\nA: See if this helps you http://www.zentyal.com/\n", "Q: What do I need to put in jetty.xml to make the admin console work?

Thanks!\n\nA: I first learned PyGTK using the official tutorial, the examples are quite simple and get complex progressively. I believe it is a nice start to understand the GTK way of writing apps (signals, boxes, widgets and so on).\nThat is a GTK 2 material, so you might want to take a look at another tutorial about writing GTK3 apps using Python. Glade integration is also covered.\nI'd also recommend understanding how (Py)GTK works before going deep into Glade.\n", "Q: Remove Google Chrome Icon From Dash Search I just installed Chromium today and removed Google Chrome via sudo apt-get purge Google-Chrome-stable\nThe application is gone, but the shortcut in my menu is still there.

First lets see what kind of graphics card do you have. Type the following command in terminal:\nlspci\n\nLook for the line with VGA in it and add that information to your question. \nMy guess is that you have an NVidia card and you have not installed the proprietary drivers. Find the Additional Drivers utility and see if any driver is available to install. If yes, installing that should solve your issue.\nEdit: Now that I see you have a Silicon Integrated Graphics card, it is clear what the issue is. I think you got somewhat lucky. I just did a quick search on the net and by looking at a blog post and this forum post on the issue, it looks like 3D acceleration was not supported for this chip at all. But from what you describe, it looks like the opensource driver available in 12.04 has got the support. So at this point you have two choices. The obvious choice which you already mentioned is to upgrade to 12.04 which isnt a bad thing specially if it is a personal laptop, and if you are learning. The other choice is to find the driver thats available for 12.04 and install that on your 11.10 if you really want to stick with the more tested version. Honestly, I think your best bet is to dive into 12.04 and enjoy living on the cutting edge for a couple of months :).\n\nA: I think the answer above is incorrect. I also can not start cheese on my 12.04 setup with an NVIDIA GT240 graphics card. I am using the proprietary driver and the webcam works perfectly with Skype. Camorama does not work either.  \nI am using 12.04 updated today 18th April. This is Beta 2 updated.\nI did a fresh installation on another machine (using the daily build) and the problem does not occur. I would suggest doing a fresh installation at the end of the month.\n\nA: You need to install bumblebee and run with optirun cheese.!\n", "Q: Windows computers can only print test pages to shared Ubuntu printer I have an HP printer connected to my Ubuntu 11.10 machine.

The Windows computers cannot print anything to the Ubuntu printer except the test page under properties or during install. I have tried word and pdf files.\n\nA: In Linux stop sharing the printer through Samba.\nShare it through CUPS instead: go to http://localhost:631/ and there will be spoe \"Share printers\" checkbox.\nOn Windows add a Network printer, and don't search for it; add manually this address:\nhttp://servername_or_IP:631/printers/printer_name\nprinter_name is the name shown in the CUPS Web interface for your printer.\nYou will be prompted to choose the proper model and a driver will be installed.

Had to disable 2-up printing on an 8-page PDF.\n\nA: If he's already printed a test page you can bet samba is already installed. What you may want to play around with is the encoding/protocol. I think you may have to send print jobs in RAW format, or try one of the other formats it offers.

I could just remove that repository - but I simply do not remember which packages came from it, so just removing it could screw my updates on some crucial package.\nSo, my question is - how do I find, which installed packages can not be found in any repository?\n\nA: Run Synaptic. In the lower left series of buttons, select \"Status\". The list above these buttons may have an entry \"Installed (local or obsolete)\". When selected, this will show you all packages that were either installed locally (eg. from a downloaded deb file) or were installed via a repository but aren't listed any more.

Be aware that that when Banshee and Shotwell are done importing your media this way, you will end up with TWO copies of every file.

This would be done by issuing: \nsudo apt-get purge banshee\n\nLastly the app Clementine will automatically put give itself a indicator applet for you to use.\n\nA: Yes, you can remove it via the Ubuntu Software Centre, or if you prefer, via the command line:\nsudo apt-get remove banshee\n\nIn Ubuntu, you can remove almost any software you don't like without encountering issues.\n\nA: You can remove banshee safely from the synaptic package manager too. But I don't know what will happen to the Indicator applets music shortcuts\n\n\nA: You may remove it but you do not need to. Just install Clementine. And if you like Clementine take a look at DeaDBeef too.\n", "Q: Gnome 3 change system notification to be as unity? the notification area in the bottom of screen is annoying, can i change the place and look of it to be as in unity? \"at the right top and disappears when hover over it\"?\nand also  is there an extension to change the icons of some programs from system tray to the upper panel?\n\nA: The extension in 'Shell OSD' is outdated, and does not seem to work with 3.6+.

How can I dual-boot a TrueCrypt-encrypted Windows 7 and Ubuntu 11.10 when both are installed separately on different physical drives? \nI have two hard drives. hd0 has a TrueCrypt-encrypted Windows 7 installation with the TrueCrypt bootloader. hd1 has an Ubuntu 11.10 installation with the grub2 bootloader.\nThe output of fdisk -l is as follows:\n  Device Boot      Start         End      Blocks   Id  System   \n/dev/sda1   *        2048      206847      102400    7  HPFS/NTFS/exFAT\n/dev/sda2          206848   976771071   488282112    7  HPFS/NTFS/exFAT\n\n  Device Boot      Start         End      Blocks   Id  System\n/dev/sdb1   *        2048   968517631   484257792   83  Linux\n/dev/sdb2       968519678   976771071     4125697    5  Extended\n/dev/sdb5       968519680   976771071     4125696   82  Linux swap / Solaris\n\nI can successfully boot into either OS by changing the boot order in the BIOS but do not want to have to repeatedly do this.

As I understand, it should search for other bootable disks.\nI also have had difficulty with option 2, and with the following inside /etc/grub.d/40_custom (and then running update-grub2) ...\nmenuentry \"Windows 7\" {\nset root=(hd0,1)\nchainloader +1\n}\n\n(I also tried root=(hd0,0) and root=(hd0,2))\n... I get errors with no such partition. I have also read various sources that suggest it isn't possible to do this with grub2 without mounting and booting into the TrueCrypt rescue disk ISO prior to booting Windows. Is this necessary?\nWhat am I doing wrong?\n\nA: I can help you in a workarround, it is quite tricky so be sure to understand it.\nFirst: BackUP all\nSecond: It requieres two physical disks, with just one i did not get to it\nGo to tricky part, the Boot secuence order process:\n\n\n*\n\n*BIOS will boot from one HDD (normally the first one)\n\n*So put there GRUB2 bootloader\n\n*Such GRUB will let you boot form partitions on first disk or boot from second disk (that is the tricky part)\n\n*If want to boot Linux, just boot from another partition on same disk\n\n*If want to boot TrueCrypt Bootloader, just tell it to boot from second disk, not from a partition\n\n\nHaving this in mind, how to archive that? Easy, follow this steps:\n\n\n*\n\n*Put only one blank HDD into the PC\n\n*Configure BIOS to boot from it (just for this time)\n\n*Install windows and TrueCrypt onto it\n\n*Tell TrueCrypt to encrypt all (only one HDD is present)\n\n*Reboot, test Windows boots\n\n*Power off correctly\n\n*Add a second disk\n\n*Create on such second HDD some partitions\n\n*One for /boot (where will go GRUB2)\n\n*The rest as you wish for Ubuntu /, SWAP, etc...\n\n*Configure GRUB2 to let boot Ubuntu and to chainload the full second HDD (beware not to tell any partition, just the full HDD)\n\n*Reboot\n\n*Tricky: Tell BIOS to boot from second HDD (as you say it let you) just forever since now\n\n*Test that boot runs GRUB2\n\n*Test that GRUB2 chain loads correctly first HDD bootloader (TrueCrypt loader) but do not put password phrase nor let Windows Boot, just reboot when password is asked for.\n\n*Reboot if not done... and test GRUB2 Linux option... will not boot since Ubuntu is not yet installed, but will not load TrueCrypt, so you see it works\n\n*Install Linux with very special care... do not let it to change any partition table... just install it on second disk using existing partitions... and when asked for bootloader tell it to install Grub or Lilo, etc... onto Linux partition, not on HDD MBR.\n\n\nWith this you will get this scheme:\n\n\n*\n\n*HDD0 - MBR with TrueCrypt, The rest for Windows\n\n*HDD1 - MBR and /boot partition with GRUB2, one more partition for / (your Ubuntu) inside that there will be another Grub, Lilo, or Grub2 loader onto /boot, extra partitions as you wish\n\n\nThe trick is:\n\n\n*\n\n*Tell TrueTrypt to encrypt as he knows one full HDD with its own bootloader.\n\n*Boot GRUB2 from another diferent HDD (BIOS need to be able to boot from second HDD)\n\n\nSo when booting this is what happens:\n\n\n*\n\n*BIOS read its config on CMOS\n\n*BIOS see to boot form second HDD\n\n*BIOS read second hdd MBR\n\n*GRUB2 is loaded\n\n*GRUB2 shows menu: Boot Windows / Boot Ubuntu\n\n*If you select Ubuntu, then GRUB2 will load another Grub, lilo, etc inside Ubuntu root partition, such other bootloader will load your Linux Ubuntu\n\n*If you selet Windows, then GRUB2 will chainload to first HDD, acting like if BIOS would boot from first HDD\n\n\nIn this way:\n\n\n*\n\n*TrueCrypt does not know nothing about the second disk for booting, do not depends on it\n\n*GRUB2 and Linux will not overwrite/ touch nothing on such first disk\n\n*BIOS will boot from Second Hard Disk\n\n\nHope it is enough clear.\nThings in mind to archive this:\n\n\n*\n\n*First, do some tests with a VirtualBOX prior to do it on real physical machine, so you get familiar to the process\n\n*Second, take note on a paper of steps you are following as you do them, just to be able to not forget anything\n\n\nNow, i must say it can be done without opening the PC... with both disks allways connected.\nImagine this:\n\n\n*\n\n*HDD0 with no partition\n\n*HDD1 with no partition\n\n*Installing Windows only on HDD0 in normal way, but do not partition HDD1\n\n*Install TrueCrypt and tell to encrypt full HDD0, it will not do anything with HDD1\n\n*Test all goes correctly\n\n*Boot from a LiveCD such a SystemRescueCD, create partitions on HDD1\n\n*Ensure you create a dedicated partition for /boot just for GRUB2, not related with your Linux, with 512MB you will also be able to put SystemRescueCD.iso on it and configure GRUB2 to loop bootload from the iso file (see SystemRescueCD web for that)\n\n*Install GRUB2 onto HDD1 MBR and HDD1 /boot partition\n\n*Configure grub.cfg of such GRUB2 to boot form your Linux root on HDD1 and a chainload to HDD0 (not to any partition on HDD0)\n\n*Test GRUB2 boots all options correctly, just test chain load goes correct... when booting Windows and TrueCrypt will ask for passphrase just reboot, do not loose time to boot the Windows itself\n\n*Install Ubuntu on HDD1 root partition and tell it to install it own grub on HDD1 root partition where your main Linux Ubuntu files goes so it does not touch HDD1 /boot partition at all\n\n\nThat is the tricky!!!\nThe idea: Use another medium to do the actual boot menu where you can select waht to boot.\nPersonally on my netbook i have this chain:\n\n\n*\n\n*/boot with GRUB2 menu with options to boot: WindowsVista, Windows7, Linux Ubuntu 32bits, Linux Ubuntu 64Bits, SystemRescueCD.iso, memtext86+, floppy, ... etc\n\n*If i select Linux Ubuntu 32Bits... it will load another diferent GRUB2 with options: Go Back (boot from HDD MBR), Kernel X, Kernel X debug, Kernel Y, Kernel Y debug, etc...\n\n*If i select Linux Ubuntu 64Bits... it will load another diferent GRUB2 with options: Go Back (boot from HDD MBR), Kernel X, Kernel X debug, Kernel Y, Kernel Y debug, etc...\n\n\nThis is the idea... have in the boot process more than one GRUB!!\nWhy more than one? Easy... in case the system updates the Grub it does not touch the one i use as a boot menu, simple and efective.\nNow, the TrueCrypt problem... if it encypts the system partition it need to be onto the MBR it do not let you any other way (except RecoveryCD).\nSo if TrueTrypt encrypts a Windows system partition, better let it the full disk\nHey! Linux also can be installed on same disk as Windows for performance... and data on the other...\nFirst HDD with:\n\n\n*\n\n*/dev/sda -> TrueCrypt loader (The MBR)\n\n*/dev/sda0 -> Windows encrypted by TrueCrypt (some GBs)\n\n*/dev/sda1 -> Linux Ubuntu / (some GBs) it will hold another Grub, a subfolder called boot and all system files, etc...\n\n\nSecond HDD with:\n\n\n*\n\n*/dev/sdb -> GRUB2 loader (The MBR) i will reference it as \"BootMenu\"\n\n*/dev/sdb1 -> /boot for GRUB2 \"BootMenu\" (512MB if you want on it SystemRescueCD.iso file)\n\n*/dev/sdb2 -> NTFS partition for DATA seen on Windows and Linux (if not encrypted) as a\n\n\nHope you will get to it.\nI had explained as this just thinking you know how to boot from a CD, configure BIOS, create partitions, install GRUB2, etc...\nThis is not for noobs. Has very advances techniques steps and is not a HowTo...\nIt is only the idea to boot from another media, such other media (a CD, Floppy, etc) will contain a Boot menu that let select to boot from First HDD or from a partition, etc... in other words GRUB2.\nHope you find it usefull.\n\nA: It seems the simplest solution for this is to use the Windows bootloader to boot into Grub rather than the other way round. Grub seems unable to boot to an encrypted windows partition even with --force.\nThere is a tool called EasyBCD (free for non-commercial use) which will properly configure the Windows bootloader to boot into Grub once you've entered your TrueCrypt password. I now have my Windows drive as the first boot device in the BIOS and Grub as the default boot item in the Windows bootloader. You can just as easily make Windows the default.\n\nA: You could just enter the boot menu and choose the HDD you want to boot from.\nIn my case I do that by pressing F11 when the POST messages are shown. It may be a different F key in your case.\n", "Q: KDE 4 opens up the items that were not closed at shutdown again Let's say i have Chromium and Dolphin open up when I shut down, then both are reopen upon reboot.How do I prevent this ?\nDWM : KDE 4\nLinux flavour : Ubuntu \n\nA: System Settings > Advanded > Session manager\nThere should be a setting for start with an empty session.\n\n", "Q: My program cannot run with \"command not found\" error I just switched from Windows to Ubuntu 11.10.\nI wrote the following code in C with the text editor and saved it as HelloWorld.c in Documents.\n#include <stdio.h>\nint main()\n{\n    printf(\"Hello World!\\n\");\n    return 0;\n}\n\nAnd I started the Terminal and enter the following commands:\ncd Documents\n\ngcc HelloWorld.c\n\nA file called a.out, which, after some search on Google, is the executable. I entered this command:\na.out\n\nBut I get \na.out: command not found\n\nWhich step did I do wrongly?\n\nA: Since you're running an executable in the current working directory, you should prefix it with ./. So for your program run it as ./a.out.\nExplanation\nThe terminal searches for executables in $PATH. This is a Unix environment variable that lists directories containing system binaries (such as ls, echo, or gcc). If you call an executable that's not in a $PATH directory (such as a.out), you need to indicate its absolute path in the file system.\nIn the terminal . is a synonym for the current working directory, thus ./a.out. You could equally well call /home/yihang/Documents/a.out.\n\nA: Essentially, the a.out is created by default because you didn't specify a name for the executable.  Try this instead:\ngcc HelloWorld.c -o HelloWorld\n\nOnce you do that, you should be able to invoke it by (as Sunil suggested) prefacing \"HelloWorld\" with a dot-slash(./):\n./HelloWorld\n\nHere's a link to an article that explains a little bit about why the a.out gets created: Writing and Compiling C Programs on Linux.\n\nA: When you run commands on Linux it searches all the directories listed in the PATH environment variable, and if it doesn't find the command there then you get the message you've seen.\nTypically it looks like this:\nPATH=/usr/local/bin:/usr/bin:/bin\n\nThat means it will look first in /usr/local/bin. If it doesn't find it there it'll look in /usr/bin, and so on.\nIn fact, this is very similar on DOS/Windows: there's a variable called %PATH% that does exactly the same thing.\nThe difference is that, on Windows, the current directory is also searched. Unix considers this bad because a local file (such as malware) can override important system programs accidentally.\nIf you prefer that though, you can make Linux work the same way by adding . to the path:\nPATH=.:$PATH\n\n(That says set PATH to .: plus the existing contents of $PATH.)\nIt ends up looking something like this (it may be different on your machine):\nPATH=.:/usr/local/bin:/usr/bin:/bin\n\nIf you'd rather not do that, you can simply run each program by specifying the directory explicitly:\n./myprog\n\nor\n/home/username/myprog\n\n", "Q: Recommended Wireless Hardware I would like to buy a wireless card or usb adapter in order to be able to connect to my home wireless network from my desktop computer.\nI heard that some cards are pain in Ubuntu, because of drivers.\nCan you recommend some usb wireless adapters that can work in Ubuntu?\nThanks in advance.\n\nA: I use this adapter for all my operating systems (Ubuntu, Windows 7 64-bit, Mac OSX) and it never failed me EVEN ONCE!\n", "Q: How To Set Up Orca Screen Reader? I'm helping a friend of mine set up an Ubuntu environment for school, but he requires special software that reads things out loud because of his dyslexia. Now, I immediately knew that Orca should do just the job for this, but I'm particularly clueless about how to set it up. Right now, it just screams random things at me when opening windows, closing them, etc., when I just require it to speak (selected) text out loud. Preferably text from text editors and PDF files.\nIs there any easy way to set it up accordingly? Because I've toyed around a lot, but haven't been able to get it to work just like I want it to. Help would be magnificent.\n\nA: The only experience I have with Orca is on Ubuntu 12.04, so I hope it has not changed much from earlier versions. \" it just screams random things at me when opening windows..\" agreed with my first experience of the program, but eventually I realized that it really is helpful.\nIt is intended primarily for folk with less than perfect vision. So it will very cleverly tell the user when the cursor is traversing a button, a link and so on, as well as read textual material -this is the origin of the words you hear which are NOT printed on the page. This serves to help orientate the user 'on the page', so they get some help navigating.\nThe voice is a huge turn off but you can improve it by selecting better settings in the preferences. When you run Orca from the menu, a small popup window appears on the screen. The left-most tab is Preferences, so click on that. Then a larger popup appears and you should select the Voice tab. About half way down the page are two sliders. \nOne is labelled 'Rate'. Slide that left so that the value changes to 30.  That slows down the speed of the speech.  Below that slider is another one labelled 'Pitch'. Slide that left until the value is around 4.0. That lowers the pitch of the voice so that it does not grate on the ears quite so much.  We're all different so it really is up to the user to find the settings which suits the ear best, volume included.\nI do not doubt that with experience of the voice, the user will eventually want to speed up the voice to faster reading speeds but initially, understandability has to be the prime consideration.\nI copied some text into a text editor. The reader announces the name of the document. I determined that the reader will read chunks of text highlighted by use of the mouse: the only thing to watch out for is that the reader says 'selected' after the end of of the selected text is reached. This would be of use to someone who can not see what is happening on screen, as is the title announcement.\nThis is a good piece of software, tailored to those with a specific need but I see no reason why it could not be used in the manner you describe: those two adjustments with other setting left default should help.  I wish you every success: good luck!!\n", "Q: Keep setting the external monitor Every time I turn on my notebook I have to configure the resolution of external monitor with the \"grandr.\" Always turn off the notebook display and change the resolution of external monitor. I wonder if I have some way to configure this setting remain as default every time I turn off the notebook.\nDoes anyone know how?\nI used Ubuntu 11.10.\nThanks\n\nA: You can modify your .xprofile or you can change /etc/X11/xorg.conf.

Your applications wants a specific version of the Rack gem and the version(s) you have installed probably don't fit that request.\nYour applications calls for rack ~> 1.1.0. That condition is matched by any version in the 1.1.x series, for example 1.1.0, 1.1.5 or 1.1.345, but not 1.2.0 or 2.0.0. You seem to have installed Rack in 1.4.1, that does not match the condition ~> 1.1.0.\nFortunately you can install different versions of the same gem side by side. To check which version(s) of Rack you have installed you can use \ngem list -l rack\n\nThat lists are locally installed (because of the -l switch) gems whose name starts with 'rack'. In that list there's probably no version of the 1.1.x series.\nTo install a specific version of a gem you can use the --version=x.y.z option, in your case\ngem install rack --version=1.1.0\n\nChances are that your migrations run through with that. \nIf you actually need to downgrade RubyGems, you first need to install the RubyGems gem ( :D ) in the version you want to downgrade to analogous to what you did above, e. g.\ngem install rubygems-update --version=x.y.z\n\nThen you can do execute the \"update\" (in your case, the downgrade)\ngem update --system x.y.z\n\nwhere x.y.z is the version number you want. Be aware that \"updating\" to a specific version has been introduced in RubyGems 1.5.1, so you can't downgrade to any version below that.\n", "Q: Server keeps asking for password after I've copied my SSH Public Key to authorized_keys I have an Ubuntu Server, running in a Cloud.\nI created a user (git). In the folder /home/git, I have created the .ssh/ dir, and the authorized_keys file.\nBut, when I put my SSH Public Key in the authorized_keys file, the server continues to ask me the password.\nWhat did I do wrong?\n\nA: On the server side, the ssh daemon will log errors in /var/log/auth.log, so check that file to see what's being reported.\nFrom the client side, when establishing the connection you can add the -v flag (or -vv or -vvv) to increase verbosity. You might be able to identify your problem this way.\nHere are other things to check.\n\n\n*\n\n*Make sure /home/git/.ssh/authorized_keys is owned by git.\n\n*Make sure /home/git/.ssh/authorized_keys has a mode of 600\n(-rw-------).\n\n\nAlso check the /etc/ssh/sshd_config file.\n\n\n*\n\n*PubkeyAuthentication should be set to yes\n\n*There is also the AuthorizedKeysFile directive which determines the\npath where the authorized keys should be located. Ensure it's\ncommented out or on the default of %h/.ssh/authorized_keys.\n\n\nA: There are different ways to solve this: you can configure either sshd (server-side) or ssh (client-side) not to use password authentication. Disabling password authentication on the server makes your server more secure, but you will be in trouble if you loose your key.\nTo make ssh (client-side) using pubkey authentication, add some options to the ssh command:\nssh -o PubkeyAuthentication=yes -o PasswordAuthentication=no -X git@server\n\nIf this works, you can set the PasswordAuthentication=no option permanently in the ssh client config file /etc/ssh/ssh_config system-wide or ~/.ssh/config user-specific (on details, see man ssh_config).\n\nA: Are you using ~/.ssh/config on your local machine? I've run into this problem when I use the IdentityFile directive in the config file and point to the public key. For example:\nHost Cloud\n    Hostname cloud.theclouds.com\n    User git\n    IdentityFile ~/.ssh/config/mykey # This is correct\n\n    # IdentityFile ~/.ssh/config/mykey.pub # This is incorrect\n\n\nA: If you have multiple private keys, use the -v switch on your ssh connection command to check to see if your other primary keys are being uesd to try to connect. If they are not, tell the ssh client to use them with the following command: \nssh-add path/to/private/key\n\n\nA: You can also add your key to the SSH Agent:\nu@pc:~$ ssh-agent bash\nu@pc:~$ ssh-add ~/.ssh/id_rsa\nEnter passphrase for /home/u/.ssh/id_rsa: # ENTER YOUR PASSWORD\nIdentity added: /home/u/.ssh/id_rsa (/home/u/.ssh/id_rsa)\n\n\nA: Also make sure your user home directory (in your case, /home/git) is only writable by you. I had this issue once because my home directory was group-writable. /var/log/auth.log said in it: \"Authentication refused: bad ownership or modes for directory /home/chuck\". (this is to make sure it doesn't use an authorized_keys file that someone other than you has been messing around with!)\n\nA: If your home folder is encrypted then your authorized_keys file is not readable before login. You have to move it outside your home.\nHere is explained and how to do: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/SSH/OpenSSH/Keys#Troubleshooting\n\nA: Another thing to check for is whether there are extra carriage returns in your public key. I followed the advice above to review the /var/log/auth.log and saw an error when reading the key.  The key was approximately two lines long instead of four.  There were extra carriage returns embedded in the key.\nWhen using the vi editor, use shift-j to join the lines and erase the extra space in the key string.\n\nA: I could the see following log message from /var/log/auth.log on remote server-\nuserauth_pubkey: key type ssh-rsa not in PubkeyAcceptedKeyTypes\nThat tells key of type ssh-rsa on my local system is not accepted by server.\nSo changed server configuration by changing and appending value ssh-rsa to attribute/property PubkeyAcceptedKeyTypes in file /etc/ssh/sshd_config on my server and restarting sshd daemon\nThat resolved the issue\n\nA: TL;DR\nOn Client side:\n\n\n*\n\n*open configuration file /etc/ssh/ssh_config;\n\n*here look for PreferredAuthentications;\n\n*make sure password comes after publickey and not viceversa\n\n\n\nIn my case password was written before publickey, so ssh would prompt me for password even though I had copied my pub_key onto server.\nThis problem can be found out easily using verbose:\nssh -v compute@compute1\n...\n...\ndebug1: Authentications that can continue: publickey,password\ndebug1: Next authentication method: password\nAs you can see password is chosen before trying to use publickey. \nEdit /etc/ssh/ssh_config by moving password after publickey\nPreferredAuthentications keyboard-interactive,publickey,password,hostbased,gssapi-with-mi\nNow I can login without being prompt for pwd. \n\nA: It could also be that you are calling\nsudo git clone gituser@domain:repo.git\nwhere the root users ssh key has not been added to the authorized_keys of gituser\n\nA: On a machine running Ubuntu 18.04.02 LTS the suggestion to set permissions of ~/.ssh to 600 did not work for me. I had to set the permissions to 700, and then things worked fine.\n\nA: I had my .ssh/ directory and authorized_keys file permissions correct but encountered this \"prompt for password\" issue due to a different, self-induced problem.\nI had used a mouse-based highlight and copy/paste to copy the info from my local id_rsa.pub into the authorized_keys file on the server.  This successfully copied the data in as a single line, but there where unwanted spaces at the end of the visible lines that were hard to see when editing the file with vi.  Once I removed these unwanted spaces I could ssh in just fine.\n\nA: So what happened for me is that I have 2 VMs to access from my local machine (2 keys id_rsa.pub and id_rsa2.pub). I realized that my ssh connection is using id_rsa.pub by default for any ssh user@xx.xx.xx.xx connection. I solved my issue by adding a config file and specify the identity to be used for every host like the following :\nvi ~/.ssh/config\n\nAdd both hostnames and their identity file as follows:\n\nHost server1.nixcraft.com\n  IdentityFile ~/Users/.ssh/id_rsa1\nHost server2.nixcraft.com\n  IdentityFile /backup/home/aymen/.ssh/id_rsa2\n\n\nA: There is one additional source of problems (again because of a wrong setting of file rights - this time the sshd deamon ):\nll /etc/ssh/\ninsgesamt 616\n-rw-r----- 1 root root   3420 10.

It makes use of terminal commands and gui operations.\nInstall Blender\nUntar (decrompress) the file and copy it to /opt/\ntar -xjf blender-2.72b-linux-glibc211-x86_64.tar.bz2\nsudo mkdir /opt/blender\nsudo cp -r blender-2.72b-linux-glibc211-x86_64/* /opt/blender\n\nCreate a Unity Launcher\nFirst, create the launcher file in gedit\ngksudo gedit /usr/share/applications/blender.desktop\n\nWith that file open paste the following text into it and save it.\n[Desktop Entry]\nName=Blender-2.7\nName[de]=Blender-2.7\nName[fr]=Blender-2.7\nGenericName=3D modeller\nGenericName[de]=3D Modellierer\nGenericName[fr]=modeleur 3D\nGenericName[ru]=Редактор 3D-моделей\nComment=Create and edit 3D models and animations\nComment[de]=Erstellen und Editieren von 3D Modellen und Animationen\nComment[fr]=Création et édition d'objets 3D et animations\nComment[ru]=Создание и редактирование трёхмерных моделей и анимаций\nExec=/opt/blender/blender %F\nIcon=/opt/blender/icons/scalable/apps/blender.svg\nTerminal=false\nType=Application\nCategories=Graphics;3DGraphics;\nStartupNotify=false\nMimeType=application/x-blender;\n\nAssociate .blend files with Blender\nFinally, to associate .blend files with Blender, right-click on a .blend file and click on Properties\n\nIn that window click on the Open With tab and select Blender\n\nNow, when you double-click a .blend file it'll open the file Blender.\n\nA: Here is a step-by-step tutorial on how to download the current version of Blender from the website and replace the version installed from the Software Center with the one that you downloaded. I hope this is what you wanted.\n1. Get Blender\nOpen your browser and go to http://www.blender.org/download/get-blender/ . Download the appropriate version for your computer, 32-bit or 64-bit. If you don't know whether your computer is 32-bit or 64-bit, open a terminal (Ctrl+Alt+T) and run the following command :\nuname -m\n\n\n2. Extract Blender\nOpen Blender in your downloads folder, right-click on the file you downloaded and click \"Extract Here\". Once it finishes extracting, move the folder containing Blender to your Home Folder and rename it \"blender\" for ease of moving it later.\n\n3. Uninstall the current version of Blender\nOpen a terminal by pressing Ctrl+Alt+T. Type this command set: sudo apt-get remove blender . \n\n4. Copy the Blender files to where they need to go\nOpen a terminal. Type ls to see what files are in your home directory. There should be a folder called \"blender\". If there is, run the following command. If not, rename the folder and try again. If there's no folder at all, go back to step 2. Command:\nsudo cp ~/blender /usr/lib/blender -r\n\nThis will copy all the files in the blender folder to /usr/lib/blender. \n\n5. Verify that the files copied properly\nOpen the file browser by clicking the \"Home Folder\" icon in the launcher. Click \"File System\" on the left side, then open the folder usr, then lib blender. See if there's anything there. If there is, move on to the next step, if not, repeat the previous steps.\n\n6. Open Blender\nOpen the Blender application. Right-click on the icon that appears in the launcher for the program, and click \"Keep in Launcher\".\n\nConclusion\nTa-Da! This is the best you can do to install the current version of Blender. You can redo these steps as many times as needed when a new version of Blender comes out. To remove everything in the blender folder so you can do these steps again, open a terminal and run these commands: sudo rm /usr/lib/blender -r . This is the best you can do, it keeps the blender files in a safe place, and gives a launcher with which to open it. You can't install the current version Blender other then this way in Ubuntu 11.10, however 12.04 will ship with Blender 2.61.

First, my disclaimer: I've used windows my whole life, and I'm trying Ubuntu for the first time (third day today), so I'm totally a newbie.\nNow, my problem: I write in Spanish a lot, so I use dead keys to accentuate characters, like this: áéíóú\nIn windows, I could use the US - International keyboard layout to achieve it, and it was nice for writing in English too for the contractions like don't, I'm, etc\nThe difference is that in Ubuntu, I have to press the spacebar for it to work, so to write I'm I have to type I, press ', press the spacebar, and then type m\nIn Windows, the spacebar was not necessary, but if I don't press it in Ubuntu I get Iḿ\nIs there another layout that achieves this Windows-like behaviour?\nI'm using English (US, international with dead keys)\n\nA: I personally use the English (International AltGr dead keys) layout on an english keyboard. I type mostly stuff in english but also need accents and special characters for spanish, and occasionally some french. I've found this layout the best, really versatile for most accented character needs and saves me from constantly switching layouts which I consider very distracting :\n\n\n*\n\n*All keys work as marked on the keyboard\n\n*When you need a special character, press AltGr (right Alt key) in combination with a letter or symbol. For instance, AltGr+vowel =\naccented vowel (áéíóú). AltGr+n = ñ.\n\n*You can \"compose\" by pressing, for instance, AltGr+6 and a vowel (circumflex, like ê), or AltGr+` and a vowel (grave accent, è), or AltGr+\" and a vowel for diaeresis (ü).\n\n*AltGr+! = ¡ and AltGr+? = ¿\n\n*Many more useful mappings, here's a full keyboard map: \n\n\n*You can get this keyboard map on your computer, go to Keyboard Layouts, select a layout, and click on the little keyboard icon (last icon on the right, below the layouts list). This will help you get acquainted with the layout.\n\n\nGetting used to pressing two keys for accented letters is a bit strange, but it's doable (took me about a week to get up to speed).\n", "Q: Windows 7 Blue Screen then restart after loading from GRUB I have Ubuntu dual booting Windows 7 and after repairing GRUB and a few Windows Updates, now Windows 7 just goes to blue screen upon loading from GRUB then restarts.  Is there any way to fix this?\nI'm using Ubuntu 12.04 32bit.\nEDIT: For something I can't get them to cooperate with each other. I've reinstalled GRUB so many times it hurts, and every time I do, I can't run Win 7 from the GRUB loader - it loads to logo then restarts.. And when I run bootrec.exe /fixmbr, bootrec.exe /fixboot and bootrec.exe /rebuildbcd I can load Windows but then GRUB goes away...\n\nA: I was posting this as a comment but it's too lengthy to fit, so I'm posting this as an answer.  I really don't know if this will do the job, as it's usually used for Windows boot problems and not because of a BSOD.  \nBut since you just can't boot into Windows at all without getting the BSOD, this might be worth a try.  (I found these instructions years ago, and don't remember where I got them or whom to credit.)  After running this, if it works and you can boot into Windows again, you'll need to boot Ubuntu from a live CD and reinstall Grub.\nHow to repair and reboot to Windows 7:\n\n\n*\n\n*Insert the Windows 7 System Repair DVD or Installation DVD and reboot.\n\n*Select the correct keyboard input method and click \"Next\".\nNote: If you are using the Windows7 Install DVD then at the 'Install Now' prompt (Do not pick the Install Now option) instead choose the 'Repair your computer' option located in the lower left of the dispay.\n\n*The System Repair tool will search for a valid operating system and will report that \"Windows found problems with your computer's startup options. Do you want to apply repairs and restart your computer?\"\n\n*Click \"Repair and restart\" and reboot again to the Windows 7 System Repair environment.\n\n*Click \"Next\" at the keyboard selection prompt and when the \"System Recovery Options\" screen appears verify that the \"Use recovery tools that can help fix problems starting Windows\" is selected.\nNote that on your Dual Boot system there now should be only one operating system listed. Click the \"Next\" button.\n\n*Now from the menu list select the \"Command Prompt\" option.\n\n*At the DOS prompt type the following three commands:\nbootrec.exe  /fixmbr\nbootrec.exe  /fixboot (may return an 'Element not found' message)\nbootrec.exe  /RebuildBcd\n\n\n*Close the command prompt window and click the \"Startup Repair\" option.\n\n*The repair process may take some time, so wait until the process completes at which point you will see two messages \"Windows cannot repair this computer automatically\" and \"Startup Repair cannot repair this computer automatically\".\nThese messages are the result of the radical changes made by removing the other drive. Ignore the Send/Dont send options.\n\n*Close this message window by clicking on the X in the upper right corner of the Send/Dont send window. Next click on the \"View advanced options for system recovery and support\" option and from the main menu once again click \"Startup Repair\". \nThis time the repair process may only that a few seconds and when prompted \"Startup Repair could not detect a problem\", click \"Finish\"  and run the \"Startup Repair\" option one more time, click \"Finish\", and then remove the System Repair DVD and click \"Restart\".  Reboot the computer.\n\nA: We would need to know the BSOD error code. Sounds like the Windows BootMGR's config is trashed.\nWhen you try to boot into Windows, hit Shift+F8. If the loader is fine this will pop up the recovery menu with options like safe mode, safe mode with networking, etc.\nYou can try safe mode, if that fails try disable Automatic restart and look into the error online.\nYou could also check grub to see what it's options are for Windows boot record (Maybe set to wrong partition/etc)\n\nA: You could use the windows bootloader to dual boot both windows and ubuntu using EasyBCD. From your description of the problem, it looks like that should fix it.\n\nA: Do you see any Windows branding before the BSoD? I don't think someone will be able to answer you confidently, rather; suggest things it could be.\nThe fact that you're getting a BSoD leads me to think that you've changed something more to do with the hard drive than boot order/loaders. Did you move this storage drive from one computer to another? Did you have another drive connected that isn't any more (i.e. Win7's boot sector)?\n", "Q: How to disable the internal sound card? I have an internal soundcard and an external USB soundcard that I use because the headphone jack in my laptop is broken. I need to be able to disable the internal card so sound will go through the USB card. This was acheivable through system settings > sound in 11.10 .\nI tried clicking on the internal sound card in the list, and muting it, then going to the USB sound card's digital output (S/PDIF) and found that it was muted as well, so I unmuted it. Then, I hit test sound, but the sound came through internal speakers again. I checked the internal card, and it was unmuted again.\nI repeated the same process with the analog output of the USB card as well. Same thing happened.\nI have not tried this yet, but I believe when I plug in my Logitech webcam, I will need to disable the built-in laptop microphone, the laptop mic jack, and the USB mic jack, for the microphone in the webcam to work as well.\nThe input side is suffering the same problem as output about muting all devices instead of just one. Maybe I'm missing something on the dialog.\nI just need to know how to selectively enable/disable sound devices through the options dialog.

Take a look at, /etc/modprobe.d/blacklist.\nTo disable my Ensoniq sound card in Ubuntu - I added the following lines to that file:\n# disable my PCI ensoniq sound card\nblacklist snd_ens1370\n\nthen just reboot...\n\nA: In your particular case I would recommend just disabling the internal sound card from bios settings since it sounds like your internal card is not usable. \nThat being said, if you have multiple sound cards you should be able to switch between them by selecting the output device from output tab in sound preferences. You should see all your sound devices in the output tab. You can put some music to play and try switching between the devices by just clicking on them, it should reflect right away and channel the sound through the right device.\n", "Q: How to automatically hide error messages in GNOME Shell's notifications?

You could also then delete the windows data and reclaim the space.\nHere is a guide after getting windows into to install ubuntu:\nhttp://www.makeuseof.com/tag/how-to-safely-dual-boot-windows-and-linux-with-wubi-installer/\nIts for an older version but should still apply\nIf you want to go the true dual boot method on OSX, read up:\nhttps://help.ubuntu.com/community/MactelSupportTeam/AppleIntelInstallation\nAND BACKUP, especially when messing with EFI\n\nA: You can just install the Ubuntu 11.10 ISO file and burn it to a USB drive and then reboot and install Ubuntu through the partitioning option. \n", "Q: Can I install a 32-bit Java in addition to a 64-bit version? For normal development I'm using the 64-bit VM which comes when I install the Java development kit (OpenJDK) with the package manager.\nBut there are some Java applications (containing native libraries, I suppose) which don't work on a 64 bit Java VM. (Looks like SoapUI is such a candidate - in version 4.0.1 and 4.5 beta 1, it fails with a segmentation fault if run in a 64 bit VM.)\nI tried to install the i386-version of openjdk-6-jre in addition to the 64-bit one, but this is refused by aptitude (saying that it conflicts with the existing 64-bit version). The same happens if I try to install openjdk-jre-7 in the 32-bit version.\nAn answer to Can I run a Java 32-bit application on a 64bit system proposed to install ia32-sun-java6-bin, but there is no package with this name (or anything with ia32 and Java).\nWhat could I do here to run SoapUI without switching my whole system Java installation to 32 bit?\n\nA: It's super easy to have multiple versions of Java installed. Somewhat harder (read: tedious) is switching between versions at a whim.\ntldr\n\n\n*\n\n*apt-get one\n\n*untar the other\n\n*export paths depending which one you want\n\n\napt-get one version\nDecide which version you'll mostly be using. Or decide which one you want to have automatic updates. Or flip a coin, whatever. You don't even have to use apt-get; just manually maintain both packages on your system (see next heading).\nThe point is: it's easier to use Ubuntu's package manager to maintain exactly one version of a package like java. You're gonna take care of the rest.\nuntar the other\nDownload a jdk tarball. Extract it to /opt. \nswitch between them\nI let the package manager handle my primary install. I export some vars for the other one when I need it. I work on the command line a lot, so it's an okay solution for me. I bother with:\nexport JAVA_HOME=/opt/jdk\nexport PATH=$JAVA_HOME/bin:$PATH\n\nAlso, I symlink jdk/ -> jdk1.6.0_3/ because I'm lazy and don't like reconfiguring my .bashrc and other scripts every incremental jdk upgrade.\nEnvironment variables you might care about:\nJAVA_LIBDIR\nJNI_LIBDIR\nJAVAJNI_LIBDIR\nJVM_ROOT\nJAVA_HOME\nPATH\n\n\nA: Installation\nFirst, download the latest 32 bit JDK (not JRE) from Sun. At the time this was jdk-6u7-linux-i586.bin for me.\nInstall java-package:\nsudo apt-get install java-package \n\nNow use java-package to build a .deb package from the binary you downloaded. You have to trick it into building the 32 bit package:\nDEB_BUILD_GNU_TYPE=i486-linux-gnu DEB_BUILD_ARCH=i386 fakeroot make-jpkg jdk-6u7-linux-i586.bin \n\nThis should generate a .deb package. For some reason the package name has the _amd64 suffix. Install the package:\nsudo dpkg -i sun-j2sdk1.6_1.6.0+update7_amd64.deb \n\nUse update-alternatives to select the new JDK. It was installed at /usr/lib/j2sdk1.6-sun for me.\nsudo update-alternatives --config java \n\nIf you run java -version you should see the correct version:\njava version \"1.6.0_07\"\nJava(TM) SE Runtime Environment (build 1.6.0_07-b06)\nJava HotSpot(TM) Server VM (build 10.0-b23, mixed mode)\n\n32 bit Eclipse\nI had to reinstall the 32 bit version of Eclipse (since SWT contains native code). I also had to delete my ~/.eclipse directory or Eclipse wouldn’t start (this requires reinstalling new versions of any plugins). Finally, add the new JRE in Java->Installed JREs using the install location (/usr/lib/j2sdk1.6-sun) and select it as the default.\nref\n\nA: Or you can only install ia32-libs\n apt-get install ia32-libs\n\nunzip the x86 jre\nhttp://javadl.sun.com/webapps/download/AutoDL?BundleId=63983\nand add to PATH if you want to.\n", "Q: How do I migrate shotwell tags to clean installation? I have Shotwell installed in 11.10.  When 12.04 comes out I will do a clean install as usual but I would like to not have to redo all those tags.  Is that possible and if so how?\n\nA: Two ways of doing this, depending on one particular setting in the options:\n \nIf you do have this box checked, all the tags are already in the photos. Just backup and restore to the new install.  \nIf you  do not have this checked, just copy your .shotwell folder from your home directory (press CTRL + H to show hidden files), and then copy it to the new install. For shotwell 0.13.0 or later, instead copy ~/.local/share/shotwell\n\nA: Make sure you back up your ~/home folder. Shotwell as with the rest of the applications, keep there settings in your home folder. \nTo back up shotwell settings. Copy or move ~/.shotwell to another partition or drive.\nExample: sudo mv ~/.shotwell    /dev/sdc1/backup/shotwell\nthis moves <sudo mv> the folder  ~/home/.shotwell /device/USB/backup folder \n", "Q: Lines disappearing intermittently from both Terminal and Emacs I'm having trouble even finding the right search terms to diagnose this problem.

Then I will see a (second) new prompt, and the result of the previous command.\nA similar thing is happening in Emacs. When I switch to a buffer, or scroll, occassionally there are several missing lines, or even portions of lines. If I highlight those lines, they become visable again.\nI'm not even sure what system controls rendering in both Emacs and Terminal.

It doesn't seem like I can change it back in Xubuntu's settings menu, when I click on Window Manager, everything is blank. Any suggestions?\n\nA: When you use \"compiz --replace\", you are replacing xfwm4 with compiz. That means the xfwm4 window manager is no longer running. Since greybird is part of xfwm4, it won't run either.\n\nA: You can try just logging out and back in as another shell (Click the gear) to get back into the settings.

When calling the Makefile in an Ubuntu 9.04 installation, we need to call just 'make'. However, when calling the Makefile in an Ubuntu 10.04 installation, we need to call 'sudo -s make'.\nIn Ubuntu 9.04, if we call 'sudo -s make', the compilation fails. And in Ubuntu 10.04, if we call 'make' the compilation also fails.\nAlthough the compilation can be carried out in both versions of Ubuntu by either issuing or not issuing the 'sudo -s' bit, we would like to have a single .sh script that calls the Makefile successfully regardless of which version of Ubuntu it is running on. Are there any differences in the way that sudo -s is treated in 9.04 compared to 10.04? And if there are, what is the best solution for ensuring that both versions are catered for in one single .sh script when calling make?\n\nA: The make command is supposed to compile the source code. That's a task that should not require any administrative privileges. For system wide installation root privileges are necessary. This means in your case, that the makefile is not correct. I don't know what it does, but it is not supposed to do it, since it requires root privileges.\nConsider the following scenario: A user wants to install software. He/She lauches\n./configure --prefix=/home/joe/bin/usr && make && make install\n\nThe make command must not require root access, this would avoid any user installing your program. You mention, it's a network driver, which is normally not necessary to be used by non-root users, anyhow, you should fix your build.\n", "Q: Print via terminal without usblp I need to print in an Epson TM-U220PD model M188D for receipts (without cups support), I used to write in a terminal [text] > /dev/lp0 but now usblp is deprecated.

How can I find the new path to the printer?\n\nA: You can install it in CUPS as a raw device and then just lp -d Epson [textfile] (or possibly cat text | lp -d Epson) That's how I talk to my Eltron printers in EPL2.   In CUPS web interface it's under \"Make: Raw\", but in gnome-print it's \"Choose Driver: Generic\" then \"Raw Queue\".\n", "Q: biblatex package recommends biber (>= 0.9), but it doesn't exist I'm not sure I understand what this means. How can Ubuntu recommend something that isn't in the repository? Am I supposed to fetch the source code and install myself? Why isn't there a biber package?\nTo be clear, I can use biblatex without biber, but it preferable to use them together.\nUpdate: OK, I guess I'll download the biber source. I'd rather not install the whole texlive, because it's cumbersome to say the least.\nBy the way, biber is a terrible package name - when searching for it on Google I keep getting it corrected to Bieber, argh.\n\nA: \nHow can Ubuntu recommend something that isn't in the repository?\n\nI would agree, if it would be a dependency.

It was the slowest of them all to download the same torrents or magnet links which I tested 8 torrents and 4 magnet links from different sites and the one that took the most to start downloading or start after a pause/resume event. The other 4 just took less than 2 seconds for example to start downloading and to download the same content between 50% less time to 80% less time.\nI think that Transmission has the same capabilities about downloading/resuming than the other torrent clients but it may be because of some configuration I need to do to get the same speed and effect than the others.\nIn my tests all torrent clients were tested with their default configurations. No changes were made. They were tested on the same PC, with the same network connection in the same time periods. So I am thinking that Transmission just needs a little bit of configuration tunning. I also set the ports for use to the same one for each. Checked the router for any blocking and anything related to the network. \nWhat options can I change to make it so Transmission resumes a download faster (grabs the seeds faster) and keeps a fast download all the time (Stays with the seeds that offer the best connection for example). Both of which by the look of it are features that the rest of the torrent clients do already.\n\nA: If you are using a router, make sure that the port used by Transmission for incoming connections is opened in your router (NAT port forwarding). As the other clients are faster, I suspect that they use a port that is already opened in your router.\nIn Transmission go to Edit > Preferences > Network and set the same port as in the other clients, and disable \"Pick a random port every time Transmission is started\". You can use the \"Test Port\" to see whether the chosen port is open.\nIt's also possible that your router is configured to accept UPnP or NAT-PMP port forwarding requests. If that is the case, you could enable the \"Use UPnP or NAT-PMP port forwarding from my router\" checkbox (instead of setting the port and opening it in the router manually).\n\n\nA: Just a heads up!\nIf you are using Uncomplicated Firewall Wall (or any other firewall) ports 6969,80/udp should be open. Otherwise Transmission cant access some of the trackers. Hence lower download speeds.\n", "Q: Will Ubuntu one sync if I update files in my local directory?

I've decided to now move onto python but I've been lost the whole time trying to learn it.  My question is in python, it all seems to revolve around numbers, lists, variables, etc. While bash seems to be much more straight forward with the commands. I can not find one example in python where there is a way to move files, change directories or other things like that. I feel like I'm already too used to bash to learn python. Can someone please explain any of this to me.\n\nA: Bash is not a programming language, but a shell targetted for quickly entering commands and executing those. Therefore, you run other commands doing your job (e.g. mv moves files and directories). Variables in Bash are limited and since commands are all strings, there is no reason to be very strict on it. (it is possible though to force types, see help declare).\nPython on the other hand is a more extensive programming language with more language features. Instead of executing other programs, you use built-in functions or other functionality from modules (libraries in other languages). For a basic tutorial on input/output in Python, see http://docs.python.org/tutorial/inputoutput.html. The whole tutorial itself is worth reading if you want to start programming in Python.\n\nA: Python is a program language; and like all other programming languages, it's designed to describe process and data.  Most of your questions deal with the API to the operating system in the os module, for example, os.chdir() and os.rename() (for the UNIX mv command).\nThe shell is an operating environment, meant to give you easy access to the operating system at various levels (files, processes, etc.).  It includes programming constructs like variables, loops, and conditionals, so in this sense it is a programming language, but it was not designed to be one - that evolved.  You can do quite amazing things with a shell script - I once wrote a call tracking system that handled 60k requests a month.  But it also has limitations that a computer language can handle better.\nFor example, you could write a web browser in Bash, but it would be inefficient, especially when trying to concurrently download the html, css and javascript pages and handle user input.  A programming language like Python, which has access to threads, would handle this more efficiently.\nWhile Python has a \"shell\" as well, it's not one that's easy to use for accessing the operating system.  But it is usable.  For example, the shell command mv * otherdirectory would be written in Python as:\nimport os, glob\nfor fname in glob.glob('*'):\n    os.rename(fname, 'otherdirectory')\n\nOr more compactly:\nimport os, glob\n[os.rename(fname, 'otherdirectory') for fname in glob.glob('*')]\n\nMost tutorials for languages want you to understand the language first, and later how it interfaces with the operating system.  For a shell, you need to understand how it interfaces with the operating system first.\n", "Q: Type Greek letters as well as physics symbols in LibreOffice Impress? I am preparing a presentation on some physics concept for which I need to write e.g. phi, phi dagger, and Hamiltoninan symbol. Is there a way to do it with LibreOffice impress?\n\nA: It's an old post but I think it might still be relevant. There's another simple way to achieve this by making use of the otherwise annoying autocorrect option. Here's how you can do that:\n\n\nA: If you want to include greek text inline with regular text, an easy way to do so is just change the font to \"Symbol\" for those characters that you want to be greek.  Then type the case-specific letter corresponding to the greek letter (e.g. P for Pi, n for nu, L for Lambda). \n\nA: I know Libreoffice Math has a symbol catalog (I believe Libreoffice writer does too) but if copying from those does not work.\nTry Ctrl+Shift+U, let go of u but not Shift+Ctrl and type 03A6 (Greek capital letter phi)\nThe code is ASCII, you can search for what you need here:\nhttp://ascii-table.com/unicode-search.php\n\nA: In Impress menu: Insert > Object > Math. Impress window should now look like Math window. Go to Tools > Catalog and fiddle with symbols. When you're done with Math input menus just click on the background of your slide. \nYou can also use Insert > Special character  but I think it lacks many basic symbols when compared to the method involving Math.\n\nLibreOffice components are integrated. Learn how to use it to your advantage ;)\n\nA: Add a formula object via main menu → Insert → Object → Formula….\n%letter seems to work most simply. For example, I wanted Lambda, so %lambda %delta %theta gives the lower case letters, and %ALPHA or %CHI for their capital versions.\n\nA: The best solution is to use latex beamer - which works very well in Ubuntu.\nLibreOffice impress has severe limitations with formulas - you cannot insert them inline with other text. It doesn't appear they are in any hurry to fix this.\nIf you insist on using impress, one workaround is to use the TexMaths equations plugin. This allows you to insert latex code into a slide. You can insert display equations. In-line equations in impress do not appear to work (but works in writer). The workaround is to create the entire slide (maybe minus the title) using TexMaths and choosing \"latex\" (rather than display or inline). For example, insert the following in the TextMaths code box:\nThis is a list:\n\\begin{itemize}\n\\item This is the first item\n\\item This is the second item\n\\item Here is an inline equation: $X_i=\\alpha_i + \\beta_i \\mu + \\epsilon_i$\n\\end{itemize}\n\nMore text can follow.\n\nThis will create a slide with text, an itemized list, and an in-line equation. You can insert the title in the regular impress slide's title text box. You can edit the TexMaths code later if necessary.\nBut - IMO - latex is superior to any other method for creating documents or presentations.\n\nA: *\n\n*In the main menu follow Insert>Object>Formula. \nThe main menu will change a bit.\n\n*Now go to Tools>Catalog. \n\n\nA: You can also do a merge of Andrew and Bucic answers if you know the name of the letter (for example delta) and you are in Writer. What you must do is:\n\n\n*\n\n*Write your text/formula and instead of the symbol use the name preceded by a %. For example: Hello this %DELTA is the uppercase delta symbol.\n\n*Select the symbol/formula.\n\n*Go to menu Insert --> Object --> Formula...\n\n*You get it converted to the symbol!\n\n\nA: You can also do alt+i -> p. Then you change the upper option to \"greek extended\" (or \"basic greek\") and find the letter.. After the first time, the pointer will already be on the last letter you chose - in the greek-letters area\n\nA: Use Insert → Special Characters.\n", "Q: How can I run update-grub on a chroot filesystem I've been building a live Ubuntu server (10.04 LTS) to run off a thumb drive and it's nearly there.\nHowever, I've gotten stuck at one step.\nI need to run update-grub but it's complaining about:\n/usr/sbin/grub-probe: error: cannot find a device for / (is /dev mounted?).\n\nMy fstab file contains:\n# filesystem   mount point     type    options                 dump    pass\nUUID=76d2077e-9726-4f95-abab-323cb426b099       /               ext2    defaults                0       0\nproc            /proc           proc    nodev,noexec,nosuid 0       0\nsys             /sys            sysfs   defaults                0       0\n\n\nA: oops... my bad.

Now to figure out why it's not booting... that's another problem.\n", "Q: Which software(s) can serve as Mathematica, Maple or MATLAB equivalents? I'd like to know the equivalents of Mathematica, Maple, or MATLAB on Ubuntu, since both are costly.\n\nA: I use QT Octave as GNU Octave does not have a nice GUI. Though most of the commands work out pretty well, some functions may not work as expected in MATLAB\n\nA: You can also give R a try.\nIt is an open-source, free, programming environment. It has both powerful visualization capabilities, power numerical libraries, and everything you would expect from a functional programming language (well, except a compiler).\n\nA: I would suggest python with appropriate libraries as a good option.\nIt is not quite a replacement, since the python language is not as specialised for mathematics as matlab/mathematica syntax, but it combines a relatively good syntax for interactive mathematics with a fully-capable programming language.\nYou will want to install the packages:\n\n*\n\n*ipython - a much nicer version of the standard python shell, with session saving, tab-completion, etc. See their website. You might also want ipython-notebook which provides a browser-based interactive session (see image below).\n\n\n\n*\n\n*python-numpy python-scipy python-matplotlib - Core scientific python libraries; Numpy provides efficient arrays for handling large amounts of data; Scipy provides algorithms, eg clustering, FFT, numerical integration, linear algebra; and Matplotlib provides a wide variety of plotting functions (including an interface designed for interactive use).\n\n\n*spyder - I normally just use these libraries with a text editor and a ipython terminal session, but if you are more comfortable with an integrated environment you may look at spyder, an IDE designed in the vein of matlab/mathematica using the above libraries. See screenshot below.\n\n\nA: Reduce, Maxima, Sage, Axiom (in three variations), and others, all are free and will provide you computer algebra on Linux.\n\nA: Freemat is a good alternative. It can handle most of the Matlab m-scripts.\n\nA: Octave provides a lot of the functionality of Matlab, and can run some Matlab programs.  Sage is the open source \"equivalent\" of Mathematica.\n\nA: Both Mathematica and Matlab are very bloated as they try to do too much and be sort of a silver bullet. As I said, they try.\nMost open source libraries and tools however, focus on a particular problem or domain area and do it the best and fastest way, while making sure that they import and export to appropriate formats so you can work with several different tools and pass your data from one to another.\nYou will likely receive much more useful response to your question by specifying the specific domain you want to work in, or the specific type of tools you need as opposed to trying to find a clone of something like Matlab, which I wouldn't use even if it was free.\n\nA: I would suggest installing Cantor which supports four different environments (Maxima, R, SAGE and KAlgebra).\nsudo apt-get install cantor\n\nIt has a very simple interface and it is easy to use.\n\n", "Q: Can I create virtual memory? On Windows you can use virtual memory to use disk space as RAM. Can you do this on Ubuntu?\n\nA: As RobinJ said before, you are looking for a Swap-Partition. Linux usually does not make use of virtual memory in a file, like windows does, but needs it on its own partition. Swap is used for suspend to disk, since this command will copy the ram into the swap space.\nTo find out if you already have a swap partition, type \nswapon -s\n\ninto a terminal. it will list all swap partitions. \nSwap files are also possible but do rarely exist. For a guide, see https://www.linux.com/news/software/applications/8208-all-about-linux-swap-space\nFor a guide of how to add swap space, please refer to How do I add a swap partition after system installation?\nBut attention! The mkswap command formats the partition which cannot easily and often not at all be restored.\nGenerally, swap is less useful (but still used!) since bigger RAM is affordable (except for suspend to disk). \nSome sources say the swap space should be as big as the RAM and a maximum of twice as big as RAM. For suspend to disk, swap space should be RAM size plus 30%.\n", "Q: Skype causes Ubuntu to freeze I got two PCs (one a little bit older Desktop and a new HP Probook 5330m LG719 Laptop), both running Ubuntu 11.10. \nWhen I log in on either of them, sooner (sometimes right after login) or later (sometimes 30 minutes afterwards) the whole desktop gets extremely slow. That is, I can no longer use it, the mouse will only move every other second for some pixels, or not at all; keyboard input does not seem to work (at least alt+f4, etc.)\nI cannot think of anything that might cause it: My laptop runs on an Intel Core 5, my desktop an AMD Phenom 9650. The former got an Intel HD 3000 graphics processor (rc6 and stuff enabled, which never caused crashes without Skype enabled), the latter a Nvidia GeForce 8400 GS with proprietary drivers.\nThe only other software I have installed that is not in the standard installation is, as far as i remember, dropbox and google chrome.\nNeither in syslog nor in the xorg log are any entries near the time of the freeze. Starting Skype in the Terminal wont give any results, it seems to crash before reporting. \nDoes anyone experienced similar problems or know a solution for it?\n\nA: It's unlikely that skype is causing your machine to crash.  The symptoms you describe sound like something is leaking memory and you are simply running out of memory.  You can determine this by watching \"top\" in a terminal and sorting by memory usage (type F then n and hit enter).  The culprit will likely be at the top of this list.\n\nA: Is this during a video feed?  There's already a bug for hard lockups during video feeds.\nhttps://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/skype/+bug/929884\nIf not, I'll file a bug at the appropriate tracker.\nEdit: Filed.

I have grub2 installed on a usb flash drive.\nAlong with a minimal installation of ubuntu server 10.04 LTS.\nThis was created using the debootstrap utility.\nHowever, now I'm trying to make it boot and having trouble getting it to do so.\nThe thumb drive has a single ext2 primary partition on it and I've copied the bootloader onto it along with the kernel and kernel modules that I need and the grub.d scripts.\nI thought since this is a thumb drive I should probably use uuid's instead of device names.\nAnyway, when it tries to boot grub2 is throwing it back to the rescue prompt with this error.\nerror: no such device: 792f......aaee3\n\nSo I ran the ls command like so:\ngrub rescue> ls\n(hd0) (hd0,msdos1)\n\nThat's confusing.  is grub2 assuming the first partition is msdos and not ext2? could that be why it's not starting?  I recall seeing somewhere that some bios's treat thumb drives as floppy drives and make the first partition msdos? is that what's going on here?\nEDIT:\nInterestingly, Ubuntu's make startup disk produced exactly the same error.\nHowever, I'm not 100% on this because when I ran it, it failed to install the bootloader.\nSo I installed it manually with the command \"grub-install /dev/sdb\"\nUpdate1:\nI discovered that because I created the grub.cfg on another system that it had hd1 in all the entries.

I'm a Web Developer and also Ubuntu user for some time. Ubuntu is my favorite and only one distribution I use. I work with Debian also but Debian is the best for server and Ubuntu for Desktop and laptop. Sad thing for me that I still need to use Windows just only because There is no chance to install Adobe CS5.5 package on Ubuntu. I tried with Wine but I wasn't successful. Also Adobe customer service informed me that installing Adobe package on Linux is illegal. Is there are any plans for changes? Is there are any chances for compatibility in near future? \n\nA: That's entirely up to Adobe to decide. I would suppose that it mostly depends on how much work it would be for them to port it to GNU/Linux and how many licenses they would have to sell in order to cover the cost of doing so. I personally would also consider the large amounts of free marketing they'd get by porting it, but it might not be part of the equation at all. \nThen again, for all we know, they're already working on it, and want to add it to the software center. Or perhaps they're waiting for others to make the platform more popular, and then they'll decide to port it. \nIn other words; it's entirely Adobes decision, and only they can answer that question. \n\nA: You should ask to Adobe, not here :)\n\nA: According to Adobe, there is no plans.

I dual-boot Windows 7 and Ubuntu 11.10 on my new ASUS K53E laptop, and have been doing so happily for a couple of weeks now.  Today I was playing a game in Windows 7, then closed the game and restarted my computer.  I should mention that it was plugged into (and exclusively using) an external monitor at the time.  Again, I have been doing this without problems for days.  When the computer rebooted and the Grub 2 menu came up, I selected my Ubuntu partition and it began loading.  Then suddenly,the screen started to flicker between a black screen with the mouse cursor and a black screen with lots of white text, but it flashes too fast for me to read.  I have disconnected the external monitor (and indeed everything but the power cord and ethernet line) and attempted to reboot but the same thing happens.

I've recently installed Cyanogen Mod 9 on my HP Touchpad tablet, but I'm encountering problems when trying to access it from my Ubuntu laptop (Ubuntu 11.10, Gnome-Shell, Nautilus).\nI've first tried accessing it via PTP as suggested here. Ubuntu will recognize the Touchpad as a digicam and only grant me access to two directories: \"DCIM\" and \"Pictures\". \nI then tried accessing the tablet via MTP using this post on OMGUbuntu!. Ubuntu will connect to the tablet, but only grant me access to a folder named \"Playlists\".\n\nA: It sounds like you are looking for USB Mass Storage mode. According to this forum thread, that doesn't exist yet in Cyanogenmod 9: http://forum.xda-developers.com/showthread.php?t=1582319\n\nA: You can access your files by setting up an ftp server  on the tablet, which is easy and allows you to access your files with Nautilus. The Swiftp app is an abandoned project but should still work. \nYou can mount the tablet over ssh by using sshfs in ubuntu with a command like: sshfs root@10.0.2.15:/mnt/sdcard /media/android -p 2222 after following my instructions here to set up an ssh server on your tablet. (SSHelper is an easy to use  implementation). This method will work over usb too.\nLast but not least: adb. It has a few quirks when comes to moving files around and it requires Java and the android sdk to be installed, but I always use it. Works over wifi too.\n\nA: Try running the program  \n\"Clockwork Tether\"\nThen try useing \"Samba File sharing\"\nThats what i would do in a pinch. But as for Mass storage not mounting, thats a rom issue.\n\nA: The easiest way to share files with Android devices is File Expert (free) - it has the option 'Share Contents -> Ftp/http' which will start an ftp or http server that you can then connect to from your other devices over the air. It also includes an ftp and sftp clients which you can use in case you have an ftp or ssh server running on your desktop.it works over the air so there is absolutely no need to use cables. Even in cases when you don't have a router or wifi internet you can still transfer files over the air simply by enabling wifi hotspot mode in your Android device and then connecting to it from your notebook.\nThe Android version of Total Commander also has an ftp client plugin that can be installed from market (both the app and the plugin are free).\n\nA: IMO, the easiest way to get files synced with Android-devices is to establish an sftp-connection with your Computer. Just run \nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get install openssh-server\n\nto get an ssh server on your computer. Now download and install AndFTP on your phone and start it. The first time you'll have to get several config done but one time configed this is a fast and easy way to get a connection and you don't even have to connect the device via USB.\nWorks only if both Computer and device are in the same Network!\n\nA: In addition to the FTP options already mentioned, there's an app you can install on the Touchpad called \"Software Data Cable\" by Dami App that sets up an FTP server that can allow access to root folders and all that as well as the normal ones.  It defaults to requiring no login, but you can set one.\n\nA: i with my android device use:\nsshdroid a simple and efficent app that run an ssh server on android (for me 2.3.5)\nsshdroid need superuser\nsetup you android app \"sshdroid\" with ip adress and port\nin your ubuntu machine you need openssh-server,\nrefer in the net for info's and how to,\ncreate after the installing you ssh public key,\nadd this in you sshdroid apps with the proper menu,\nif all work fine,\nsimply open nautilus-->file-->connect to server\nssh server put the ip of your android device\nput you android ssh port\nand connect, nautilus ask you for some confirmation,\nyou can save this connection in your bookmarks.\n(remember android with the same ip adress for every connection-otherwise you bookmark don't work).\nit's simply, secure, crypted connection and complete browsing of you android paths.\n\nA: When I connect my CM9 Transformer to 12.04 with Gnome Shell it does not connect until USB Debugging Mode has been disabled. I then see two drives, one for internal memory and another for my removable card.\n\nA: With the HO Touchpad first set it to USB mode, then use the charger/USB cable and plug it into your main computer.\nUbuntu should automount it as a USB device, which you can browse and move files between graphically, unless you prefer the command line, in which case you'll have to identify the automount directory name and path to it.\n\nA: http://soledadpenades.com/2011/06/12/honeycomb-mtp-and-linux/\nIf you want to transfer files between your computer and your tablet, get aafm, an application written to work around MTP issues with Linux.\nAndroid ADB File Manager - A command line + GUI (GTK based) Android ADB-based file manager.\nhttps://github.com/sole/aafm\n\nA: I think you want to turn on the MTP button and have things magically happen, just like they do in other operating systems.\nI encountered your same problem following the top-voted instructions: only got \"Playlists\" visible.

I would like to know how to install .deb packages without using a package manager such as dpkg.  Is it possible to do this?  What files do I have to edit?  Or is there a unique procedure for each package?\n\nA: You can unpack a .deb package using\nar x your_package.deb\n\nEvery .deb package contains the two files control.tar.gz and data.tar.gz. \ndata.tar.gz contains all the program's files. \ncontrol.tar.gz contains the metadata and some scripts: preinst is run by dpkg before unpacking data.tar.gz, postinst after unpacking. When removing a packge prerm is run before the program files are removed and postrm after that.\nQuite likely this scripts don't work on a Non-Debian system but they may contain code you need to run to make the program work.\nWhy do you want to do this?\n\nA: Why do you need to do this?\nThe .deb file contains files to be unpacked in specific locations in the filesystem, including configuration files, and some scripts to be executed before and after installation, upgrading and removal of the package. Failure to run the appropriate steps will result in a borked installation, which will be really hard to revert if the files are not under package manager control. Also, running the scripts may require some environment that's set up by the package manager and that may be quite difficult to replicate by hand.\nThat said, you can unpack a .deb file by hand:\nar x file.deb\n\nthis will leave three files: control.tar.gz, data.tar.gz and debian-binary. The two tarballs contain the control files, checksums and scripts (control.tar.gz) and the actual files to be unpacked on the filesystem (data.tar.gz). You may be able to get what you need by unpacking and analyzing these files. \nRead more about the .deb package format here: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deb_%28file_format%29\nBut to stress the point again, this is not really recommended and you stand a high chance of ending up with a borked install.\n", "Q: Is it possible to show the device ID in nautilus properties?

Beginning with (Lucid) 10.10, Ubuntu began using base-10 to represent storage sizes. For me, working with Windows all day and then going to work on my Ubuntu notebook, it is very irritating to have to calculate values sometimes. I understand that it is the recommended policy to use base-10 (GB), but I am all too familiar with base-2 (GiB, or GB on Windows) and I blame Windows. So here is my question:\nIs it possible to switch Ubuntu's Units policy to base-2 and if so, how?\n\nA: It is possible for KDE apps.\nJust change it in your system settings.\nFirst, install systemsettings clicking this\nthen, run it\nThen, choose Locale ▸ Other ▸ Byte Size Units\nselect the one you want.\n\nA: The only way to do this, would be to patch (or in some cases, un-patch) all of the code which displays sizes to the user, and recompile your own fork of Ubuntu which has all of the sizes displayed using base 8 math (which is what you are asking for, and not base 2). It is a very invasive change to make, and is not an Ubuntu specific thing, as upstream applications were already doing this. The Ubuntu policy on size display is merely to clarify the matter, and to provide an official stance.\nThere is no setting which will switch between GiB and GB in all applications. If that's what you're looking for, the only way you're going to get it is to maintain patches to everything, which does so; unless you can convince all the upstreams to use such a setting, and provide patches, which they accept.\nI'm sorry if you're looking for a simpler solution, but it doesn't exist, and isn't likely to anytime soon.\n\nA: I don't believe this is possible without switching to a previous version of Ubuntu.  \nEdit\nUnless you want to compile it yourself in base-2 :)  You might gain some fans\n\nA: The first step would be to open bug reports for every affected package, and secondly send it upstream to be fixed.\nUbuntu does have a \"Units Policy\" so this is a very-long-term plan (I assume).\nhttps://wiki.ubuntu.com/UnitsPolicy\nhttps://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+bugs?field.tag=units-policy\n", "Q: Wubi install does not load I'm new to Ubuntu and want to install it along side Windows, so I can get the hang of it.\nI installed it using Wubi, I then chose to run Ubuntu from the boot menu it does then I get 2 options: \n\n\n*\n\n*generic and recovery. \n\n\nIf choose the generic version but it doesn't load up at all.

But at least the age in years is worth calculating:\necho $((1315125649/(365*24*60*60)))\n41\n\nSo it is 41 years after 1.1.1970 (ignoring leap years and daylight saving time, and cutting the result to whole years) which is 2011. The other fields can be computed as well - I prefered to do it with scala by\nscala> val d = new java.util.Date (1315125649*1000L)\nd: java.util.Date = Sun Sep 04 10:40:49 CEST 2011\n\nSo I remove the whole section, and after relogin, this session is vanished from my list of sessions.\nupdate:\nI now know the much simpler solution for the date issue, simply put into the shell:\ndate -d @1315125649\nSo 4. Sep 10:40:49 CEST 2011\n\nSo this can be made into a simple script:\nfor f in  ~/.cache/sessions/xfce4-session-* \ndo\n   la=$(sed -n -r 's/LastAccess=(.*)/\\1/p' \"$f\")\n   echo -e $(date -d @$la) \"\\t$f\"\ndone \n\nFr 9.

I guess renaming it to something else will remove session entries.\nE.g.\ncd /usr/share/xsessions\nmv gnome.desktop gnome.desktop.backup\n\nxfce caches its session in $HOME/.cache/sessions as well as has configurations in $HOME/.config/xfce4-session. You could try viewing those folders as well. I think xubuntu has folders with names xubuntu in place of xfce as it has its own session manager.\n\nA: This is how it goes:\n\n\n*\n\n*Click on Settings manager at the app menu or run xfce4-settings-manager from a terminal\n\n*Click on 'Session and Startup'\n\n*Uncheck 'Display chooser on login' on the general tab, 'Session Chooser'\n\n*Also review the 'Logout Settings' on the same tab.\n\n**In session tab, Click 'Clear saved session' *\n", "Q: How can I install on a Dell M1730 laptop? I currently have a Dell M1730 laptop that with the aquisition of my new system is now surplus, so thought it'd be good to throw Ubuntu on it (anything is better then the Vista currently on it).\nHowever once I get to the menu to select \"Install Ubuntu\" and select a language, the screen starts blinking red, green, blue, etc.... across the whole screen in two second intervals.

Anyone else ran into such a strange issue, and is it compatible with this laptop?\nVersion is 11.04, 64bit\n\nA: @candiancreed I had an idea of what I was planning to recommend you try, and found a post supporting my theory. You should try and use the Alternative Desktop .iso. The installation using that version is a text base (ncurses) installation and will allow you to get passed the video issues you're experiencing. I am pretty sure the problem is that the 'nv' driver has been deprecated (outdated/no longer included) in the kernel. \nOnce installed by that method, I would normally have recommended installing the kernel source, and nividia's drivers from their site. While trying to learn a little more about what others have done I came across an archived ubuntu forum post in which sunsp0t described using a spare monitor hooked up to the M1730 so that the device could be logged in and the Additional drivers could be utilised to install the detected hardware drivers. \nPlease try this, as I feel it is your best bet. If you have any questions, or need a little further guidance with getting this accomplished leave a comment and I'll see if there is a way I can help you further. \nHope this helps!! \n\nA: When you first see a brown screen during install, there should be symbol of a human and a keyboard, at this point press any key on your keyboard and you get access to a special install menu.

I have been trying to install Ubuntu for the last few days and have had no success at installing to my internal SSD.  After trying to format it in Mac OS X and GParted (Which always resulted in a corrupted, unreadable disk), attempting to install from USB and CDs, and always having it fail at the installation phase, I decided to just install to my external.\nNow that I have a working Ubuntu installation on my external, can I just partition my internal and then duplicate the partitions from the external disk? How would I go about doing this and would it be better to use Mac OS X or Ubuntu?\n\nA: It sounds like your SSD is not working correctly so you should sort out those issues first.  If you want to, you can just copy everything from the hd to the ssd.  Boot Ubuntu into rescue mode and go to a root shell.  Format the ssd, then mount it somewhere, and simply copy all of the files over, then update grub.  Replace sda1 with the correct drive:\nmke2fs -t ext4 /dev/sda1\nmount -t ext4 /dev/sda1 /mnt\ncp -ax / /mnt\nblkid -p /dev/sda1\nnano /mnt/etc/fstab\n\nWrite down the UUID that blkid reports, and change the UUID for / in fstab to match.  Then update grub and reboot:\nmount -o remount,rw /\nupdate-grub\nreboot\n\nWhen you reboot, grub should have an entry to boot from the ssd.  Make sure it boots correctly, and check mount to make sure that / is actually mounted on the ssd.  If it is, run sudo dpkg-reconfigure grub-pc and check the box to install grub on the ssd, then you can reboot, configure your BIOS to boot from the SSD, and recycle the Ubuntu partition on the HD.\n", "Q: How can I configure the touchpad and keyboard settings on a Dell Inspiron 5110?

I've downloaded dhcp3 on my server and I now need the server to assign ipv6 addresses. \nAlso what is stateless autoconfiguration and how do I use it on my server?\n\nA: IPv6 address provisioning usually works like this:\n\n\n*\n\n*The router sends a Router Advertisement (RA).\nOn Linux/Unix/etc this is done by RADVD\n\n*\n\n*The RA indicates for how long the sending router can be used as default gateway\n\n*The RA contains flags that indicate the provisioning method used:\n\n*\n\n*The (M)anaged flag indicates if there is a DHCP server for address assignment (stateful mode)\n\n*The (O)ther configuration flag indicates if there is a DHCP server for other configuration options (stateless DHCP: only provides options but does not do address management)\n\n\n*The RA contains the prefixes that are used on the LAN\n\n*\n\n*Each prefix option indicates if that prefix can be used for (A)uto-configuration\n\n\n*RA's can also contain the addresses of DNS resolvers\n\n\n\nStateLess Address Auto Configuration (SLAAC) is the name for when there are prefixes with the (A) option on in the RA. The systems then can configure their own IPv6 addresses based on those prefixes and use the router as default gateway. Optionally a stateless DHCP server can provide extra options (like domain name, DNS resolvers, time server, etc).\nSo if you want to configure your Linux box as a router you will need RADVD and optionally a DHCPv6 server in either stateful or stateless mode.\n\nA: You can use wide dhcpv6 server: sudo apt-get install wide-dhcpv6-server.

It will overwrite timeout settings in grub.cfg, so it doesn't matter what you have in /etc/default/grub.\nSo I have hidden menu that can be invoked by shift for 2 sec.\n\nA: I solved this problem by disabling the OS Prober. I did that because in /boot/grub/grub.cfg in the part generated by the template /etc/grub.d/30_os-prober, there was an override of \"timeout\" to 10 and \"style\" to menu.\nEdit /etc/default/grub and add this line:\nGRUB_DISABLE_OS_PROBER=true\n\nHope you find this useful!\nBTW, my full /etc/default/grub is:\nGRUB_DEFAULT=0\nGRUB_TIMEOUT=0\nGRUB_TIMEOUT_STYLE=hidden\nGRUB_HIDDEN_TIMEOUT=0\nGRUB_HIDDEN_TIMEOUT_QUIET=true\nGRUB_DISTRIBUTOR= [...]\nGRUB_DISABLE_OS_PROBER=true\nGRUB_RECORDFAIL_TIMEOUT=0\n\nHappy coding\n\nA: if you want to remove a boot entry just type in:\nsudo update-grub\n\nIf that doesn't work, install the startup manager,\nlike so:\nsudo apt-get install startupmanager\n\n\nwith startup-manager you can\n\n\n*\n\n*choose with entry to boot in,\n\n*choose the resolution and, how long to wait before booting,\n\n*you can also choose 0 for automatic booting the default\nboot-entry\n\nA: for all of you that have word splash in cmd line anything but hardcoding 0 for timeout won't work,,\nGRUB_DEFAULT=0\nGRUB_HIDDEN_TIMEOUT=0\nGRUB_HIDDEN_TIMEOUT_QUIET=true\nGRUB_TIMEOUT=10\nGRUB_DISTRIBUTOR=`lsb_release -i -s 2> /dev/null || echo Debian`\nGRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT=\"quiet splash\"\nGRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX=\"\"\n\nTry removing word splash from second last line, update and reboot,, voila, no menu :)\nhth, krex\n\nA: Like Agustin, I found that my issue was with the OS Prober. Doing one step better than his solution, I found this gist that will let you have your OSes but still hide the menu. You just need to download those two files, put them into /etc/grub.d, and give them the same permissions as the other templates in that directory.\nIf you ever want to access your non-default OS, just hold down shift while booting up. That will show the menu.\n\nA: Ideally, we could just put\nGRUB_TIMEOUT_STYLE=hidden\nGRUB_TIMEOUT=0\n\ninto /etc/default/grub and be done with it. Unfortunately, at least on Manjaro, the file /etc/grub.d/30_os-prober overrides these settings. We could disable that file, but here's a better solution: create /etc/grub.d/99_quiet with these contents:\n#!/bin/sh\n\ncat <<EOF\nset timeout_style=hidden\nset timeout=0\nEOF\n\n(With this file, we don't even need to modify /etc/default/grub at all.) Make it executable and run sudo update-grub (or sudo grub-mkconfig -o /boot/grub/grub.cfg if on Arch).\nReboot and GRUB will not display the menu or introduce any delay during boot. But, you can still get the menu if you hold down Shift after the hardware has turned on but before GRUB has started.\nTo understand what is happening here we must understand how GRUB configuration works. There is a /boot/grub/grub.cfg file in a special DSL that is read by GRUB during boot. This can be written manually but it is preferred to generate it using update-grub (i.e. grub-mkconfig). That command uses /etc/default/grub and /etc/grub.d to generate the grub.cfg. The /etc/default/grub is sourced first, to set the configuration parameters for update-grub to generate the file.

This way GRUB_TIMEOUT= applies again and your change will persist resourcing grub.cfg.\nHow to: \nStart off by by trial and error: search for set timeout in /boot/grub/grub.cfg and change the timeout, reboot (do not run update-grub) and check if that changed the grub menu. If not, undo last edit and move to the next.\nAfter you found the miscreant line in grub.cfg you need to look where it came from. Look for the ### BEGIN & ### END (/boot/grub/grub.cfg is generated by update-grub and sources files in /etc/grub.d/). In the vicious file, eg. /etc/grub.d/00_header, comment the corresponding line that sets the timeout and run update-grub. \nNow GRUB_TIMEOUT=0 will skip the menu\n\nA: I have a dell XPS plus with Ubuntu 22.04.

I have two computers, both on Ubuntu 10.10 (Maverick).  One is an Intel E6500 (2.93GHz/2GB/2MB cache) and the other is an E8400 (3.0GHz/2GB/6MB cache) connected via an ethernet cable.  Both have identical WiFi cards and no browser activity nor downloads are in progress when I perform a computer-to-computer file transfer via Nautilus copy and paste.  \nI am using SSH server and client.  When I copy and paste a 3.2MB file from one computer to the other using Nautilus 2.32.0, it takes about 20 seconds.  Edit This is a lot slower than expected if the physical layer employed here is the cable.  Is this normal?\n\nA: Slow network transfers can have various reasons, basically one for each layer in the OSI model (this is actually a case where it's handy :-))\nFirst of all, the physical layer. You don't mention whether you use the cable or the wifi cards for the transfer, so I'll suspect wifi: Even with your computers in the same room, a Wifi connection may suffer from interference, either from other Wifi components using the same frequency or other users of the license-free 2.4 GHz band. Without a spectrum analyzer, your simplest method to analyze this is to check whether a simple netcat-based transmission is faster. If it is just as slow, your problem is likely here. Try switching channels on your wifi cards.\nOtherwise, check with larger files and report your results here. For such small files, the time needed for the handshake may dominate the actual transfer time.\n", "Q: What is the difference between minimal, desktop & server Editions? I just want to know, what is the difference between ubuntu Minimal, Desktop & Server Editions? How they differ? is it by performance? If yes which one is recommended for a normal user and which one is recommended for a advanced user ?\n\nA: The difference comes from the kernel and software installed.\n\n\n*\n\n*Minimal: just the enough software to get you to a working command line. The kernel is normal.\n\n*Server: In pre-precise versions (i.e., before 12.04 LTS) you had the choice to install the server kernel, which works with lower latency and with different task scheduler. This install still gets you to the command line\n\n*Desktop: Normal kernel, default selection of software, and you get the graphical user interface.\n\n\nThey only differ from the installed packages, which you can later easily modify. If you want to install a server, choose the server version, if you want to use it as a desktop, choose the desktop version. If you need more performance, compile your own kernel from source.\nBtw: if you want a lowlatency kernel, you can install the package for it (this has been available starting in precise). Your system will be more responsive but the CPU usage will be higher.\n", "Q: How to solve: \"Connect to host some_hostname port 22: Connection timed out\"? I have two Ubuntu machines.

When I have more than one instance of a program running and I minimize all of them, they are grouped in a single icon on the launcher. For example, I'm chatting with three people on Emesene: Joe, Mary and Paul. Then I minimize all three windows and they are grouped in the same Emesene icon on the launcher. Then, if I want to restore only Joe's window, I can't because if I click on the Emesene icon on the launcher, it restores all three windows automatically (or it shows that animation with all open windows available for me to choose - but this is laggy for me here - probably my computer - so it's useless).\nI'd like to know if there's any way to either \"ungroup\" windows, showing a separate icon for each of them, or have a kind of a \"context menu\" or a quick list, showing a list of all grouped windows so I could choose and click on the one I want only.\nIf I can disable windows grouping, excellent. I think that would be better. If not, I thought of something like this...\n\n\n*\n\n*Right-click on the icon with grouped windows.\n\n*A menu appears showing all windows available: Restore all, Joe, Mary, Paul.\n\n*I pick what I want from the list and the window(s) is(are) shown.\n\n\nThat's it. Does this exist yet? If so, please, could you help me find it or do it?\n\nA: You can find more information about this question in How to disable the grouping of windows on the launcher?\nBut in general here is what I wrote (Could not merge the 2 questions because of the bounty). Also note this applies to 12.04+. And is specially noted and useful on 13.04.\nThe reason why this feature is not available is because of a productive (and actually not counter-productive) reason. Please give me a second to explain so you can also understand. Follow me on this one for the reasons behind this:\nImagine you need to open not 2 Firefox Windows, or 4, but 10 or 20. Now imagine having the Unity Launcher with the common icons it has plus 10 to 20 firefox icons there. You would see 10-20 firefox icons, all the same, and would first have to guess which one takes you to the webpage you wanted to go. Secondly, if you wanted to close them you would have to go, one by one and start closing them manually.\nSo we have 3 issues:\n\n\n*\n\n*If a user wants to open many windows of the same program.\n\n*If a user wishes to switch easily between all opened windows of the same program.\n\n*If a user wants to close many windows of the same program.\n\n\nWith this 3 issues an idea came to mind. Group them together in a single icon in the Launcher that represents the application in use and offer in a one right click solution, all the options needed to cover the rest of the issues.\nBetween 12.04 and the soon to be release 13.04, there has been much work put out to not only solve this 3 issues, but to help the end user work faster and easily, with just a minor learning curve. The end result (For 13.04 for example) is an icon that can deliver many windows of the same application and offers the possibility to change between them in  an almost one click solution.\nNot only can I manage several windows of the same app quickly from within one launcher icon, but if the need arises, I can close them all with the \"Quit\" option in the launcher icon's context menu. Saving me time in case I had 20 Firefox Windows opened.\nI also felt the pain when I could not access my multiple windows in an easier manner, but after using this method, I found it was easier, quicker to search in, since I did not have to go through many launcher icons to guess which one is the one I was looking for, neither did I have to scroll down the Unity launcher between 20 Firefox Windows, 30 Chrome ones and 40 Nautilus ones just to get to the one I needed. Overall, it saved me time when I needed to find the correct one and work on it.\nAs you can see, it focused itself to be more productive to the end user, with just a slight touch in the learning curve.\nNow, if you actually wanted to have the option to ungroup them, it would involve, downloading the Unity source and any dependencies related to it. Modifying the code so you could actually ungroup them, by default or as an option, compile this and install it on the system, making your Unity be able to ungroup them as you wish. But in this case, I would ask, is it better than the solution provided by the Unity Development Team?.\nThis of course is left to each person to decide on how they like to use their system. In my humble and honest opinion, I feel the change made by the Unity team, solves several issues I had on 11.10 or even on 12.04 related to this, and the way it works on 13.04 is much better than I anticipated.\nI am sorry there is no straight and specially, easy answer and I really hope you can take a moment and test out the behavior of this feature as it is on the latest Ubuntu version (Specially 13.04 if you have the time). For your case, I would encourage and recommend you take the time to upgrade your system, or even better, download the 13.04 version and test it yourself. It is a huge jump from 11.10 in regards to how Unity and the whole system behaves and helps you accomplish tasks quickly. Hope you see it this way too.\n\nA: You can't ungroup windows. However, quicklists can be used like you suggest. It's up to the application to decide. Also note that you can use Alt+(the button above Tab) to switch between windows of an application like Alt+Tab works with applications. \n", "Q: Are terminal and shell the same? I know this might sound foolish but I just wanted to know if there is really a difference between the two words used in the Linux world. I do know that the Shell is a Command Line Interface and has many variants like Bash, Korn, etc. And I also know that a Ctrl+Alt+T launches a terminal on Ubuntu. I just want to connect these two dots. \nDoes it mean the terminal is the window that opens up and the shell is the program that runs behind to interpret the commands typed in the window? Or are they same wherein terminal is a generic term used to abstract the concepts of Shell,etc?\nWhat is it that exactly differentiates the two words?\n\nA: I think this question has been explored pretty thoroughly on the Unix and Linux stackexchange site: Differences between shell, console and terminal\n\nA: Yes, the terminal emulator and the shell are two different programs.  As you're aware, one example of the difference is that launching a terminal window can run different shells depending on what you have configured (bash, tcsh, ksh, ash, even python!).\nAnother difference is that there are more terminal emulators than just the default: gnome-terminal, several varieties of xterm, konsole (for KDE), etc. (see: http://www.howtogeek.com/howto/ubuntu/set-the-default-terminal-emulator-on-ubuntu-linux/ ).  Any shell can be run in any of these terminal emulators, without much difficulty.\nA third difference is that, besides running shell commands, you can also start certain interactive applications in your terminal emulator, and they will run in the same window (and still relying on the same terminal emulator program to handle the actual graphics), such as the vim text editor, the nethack RPG, and others.  If you wanted, you could set up a profile in your terminal emulator to start nethack, say, automatically when you opened a new tab; no shell involved, but the terminal emulator is still the same program.\nA fourth difference is that you can perform remote logins, using a program like ssh, from inside a terminal window.  In this case, your shell (or whatever program you run remotely) is running on another computer, and the ssh program connects it to the local terminal emulator program running on your machine which handles graphics.\n\nA: The terminal emulator (often just called terminal) is \"just the window\", yes. It runs a text based program, which by default is your login shell (which is bash in Ubuntu). When you type characters in the window, the terminal draws these characters in the window in addition to sending it to the shell's (or other program's) stdin. The characters the shell outputs to stdout and stderr get sent to the terminal, which in turn draws these characters in the window.\nSo yes, the shell and the terminal emulator are completely separate programs, and either can be used without the other.\n", "Q: Can't upgrade to 11.04 due to partial upgrade I am trying to upgrade to Ubuntu 11.04. when I try I get this popup message from the upgrade manager:\n\nNot all updates can be installed\nRun a partial upgrade, to install as many updates as possible.\n\nthis can be caused by:\n\n*\n\n*A previous upgrade which didn't complete\n\n*Problems with some of the installed software\n\n*Unofficial software packages not provided by Ubuntu\n\n*Normal changes of a pre-release version of Ubuntu\n\n\nButton: Partial upgrade or Close\n\nWhen I choose the Partial Upgrade\nI get an error message saying:\n\ncan not upgrade\nAn upgrade from Maverick to lucid\nis not supported with this tool\n\nSo I cant upgrade.

The output is always the same. The Gnome Display Settings Dialog also only sees the internal laptop display.\nSo how can I use external displays with the Intel driver? Or are external displays in a NVidia/Intel hybrid setup only connected to the NVidia GPU and even Windows has to switch to the NVidia GPU when external displays are attached?\n\nA: Found the problem. I should have mentioned that I'm using a docking station. And after taking a closer look on it I found out that there is also a VGA connector on it. So when docked the VGA port of the laptop seems to be deactivated. But the VGA port on the docking station works when using the Intel GPU. I also had to remove the DVI cable from the external monitor because it didn't switch to VGA mode otherwise. \nWell, I would have preferred using DVI or HDMI but VGA runs fine, too. So finally I can use stable Intel graphics in dual-head mode. Nouveau and commercial NVidia are too buggy in Gnome Shell for my taste.\n\nA: You should blacklist the nvidia, nv and nouveau module in /etc/modprobe.d/blacklist.conf\nI am not sure if your machine supports external displays when running the intel gpu, I have a Lenovo W520 and on this machine external displays aren't supported when running on intel gpu.\n\nA: Most probably the problem is that HDMI output is wired to the NVidia, so typically you cannot use external monitor and have NVidia disabled.\n", "Q: csh \\ which $SHELL still gives /bin/bash I need to switch to c-shell and after installing it via software-center\nit looks like I am ready to go.\nNevertheless, when I type 'csh' the line changes to %_\nI am still not in a c-shell.

It is simply set, when you log in, to the value of the login shell field of /etc/passwd, which in your case is /bin/bash.\nIf you want to change your login shell, run chsh (change shell).\nThe login shell set in /etc/passwd controls, among other things, what shell is run when you open a terminal emulator, such as gnome-terminal.\nTo see what shell you are currently using, try ps -p $$\n\nA: You need to change your default login shell and there many ways to do this. The command to change shells is -->   chsh -s csh  <-- will change your login shell to csh. After this it will be nessesary to logout and login to your account. -->  Ctl-d  <-- is for logout.\nAlso, you can check out all of the users login shells in the /etc/passwd file.

How can I reform this code not to require the sudo pass-phrase at run time?\n\nA: For this particular problem, you could probably just stick echo 1000 > /sys/class/backlight/intel_backlight/brightness in /etc/rc.local (before the exit-line). That would run it on boot, as root before the desktop was loaded.\nBut in general (how do I run a script as root?) things are a bit sticker...\nYou could just run sudo ./myscript (by editing sudoers) but just allowing ./myscript to be run without a password would mean you (or a program running as you) could edit that file and suddenly you can run anything as root without going through the proper procedures. Uber-poor security.\nInstead I would suggest:\nsudo mv myscript /sbin/myscript\nsudo chown root:root /sbin/myscript\nsudo chmod 700 /sbin/myscript\n\nThe ch* commands now mean only root can read/run the script. Sticking it in /sbin/ is just incidental - you don't have to do that.\nNow you need to edit /etc/sudoers. The Wiki has a good example and you'll just need to substitute the shutdown commands with your script's path (use a full, absolute path). NOPASSWD is the key keyword here. It allows you to run something as sudo without the password.

I'll install ubuntu and manually add packages that I know I use, configuring them one at a time.  The list of packages installed on your old computer is a good starting place to find different pieces.  Once stuff is more or less set up, I'll then copy over just the data files (but not the config files) from my old computer.  This does take more time to do, but it's worth it to switch to the newest version.  (My old desktop runs 10.04, my new on currently runs 11.10, although I plan on updating that to 12.04 when it has been around for a month to work off any remaining rough edges)   But this plan is for if you're ok with a few things working slightly differently than before.  If you need things to be exactly the same, go ahead and do the above.\n\nA: There are several utilities that can make direct copies of your file system and some (Norton Ghost for example) can adjust your partitions to adapt to the new disk.  Software like this allows you to not only copy from disk to disk but also keep a separate, compressed backup for yourself in the future.\nThere's also the tool dd to do this, however it takes a bit more knowledge and research to produce the results that you would like.\n\nA: Most configs and personal files will be in /home. For example by default my GNOME theme, shell settings, Chromium history/bookmarks/etc., vimrc, bash_profile, and most settings carried over nicely. \nAn important thing is to preserve permissions and timestamps. See Copy files without losing file/folder permissions The -a flag for rsync is ideal for this. Rsync is recommended for large file transfers. Use --partial-dir to be able to restart progress. I also exclude .gvfs (not a real file) and .cache.\n\nAlso consider installing /home on a separate partition if you are just reinstalling the system on the same hard drive. What are the pros and cons of having a separate home partition? \n\nA: Remember that you can easily remove your hard disk from one machine to another without any problem.\n", "Q: displex indicator not working in Ubuntu 11.10 I have installed Displex 0.7.2 from Source Forge.

Ubuntu, and other distros, could not ship the OpenSSL key module due to licensing issues with the GPLv2-licensed libecryptfs.\nThe copyright holders to the OpenSSL key module recently added an exception that should allow distros to ship the OpenSSL key module.\nYou can probably expect the key module to show up in the Ubuntu release after the 12.04 release. Note that the time frame is still undecided.\nIn the meantime, you could compile ecryptfs-utils yourself and copy the libecryptfs_key_mod_openssl.so to the appropriate location (likely /usr/lib/ecryptfs/).

What they mean is that you should be in the the root directory of juju's source branch. So:\n$ bzr branch lp:juju\n$ cd juju/\n\nThis is more of an assumption than a prerequisite. It seems to me that the only reason why this is \"required\" in the example is so that the paths in your commands match the paths in the example commands. Like this one from the \"Test run\" section:\n$ juju deploy --repository=examples local:oneiric/mysql\n$ juju deploy --repository=examples local:oneiric/drupal\n\nIf you're not in \"juju trunk\" you could rewrite that as:\n$ juju deploy --repository=path/to/repo local:oneiric/mysql\n$ juju deploy --repository=path/to/repo local:oneiric/drupal\n\n", "Q: How can I manually assemble my own package \"the hard way\"? I would like to know how to create my own .deb packages from the source of a program without the aid of a package manager or any other similar tool (in other words, doing it manually).  How difficult is this?  Do I need to create my own repository for this to work?  Do I need to sign it with my public key or something?  Will one deb package work for all Debian-based distributions, or do I need to build a separate version for each flavor?\nEdit: I would like to point out the main difference between my question and \"Simplest Debian Packaging Guide?\", which is that, while the asker of that question wishes to create a package with minimal time and effort, I want to go the long way around, not for the sake of making it harder, but because I want to understand how the packaging system works.  In short, I want to learn.\n\nA: \nHow difficult is this?\n\nNot so difficult at all. I do all my packaging from scratch. Once you know a few tools, and understand what's going on, the process is fairly simple. Be prepared to spend some time, learning the processes, though.\n\nDo I need to create my own repository for this to work?\n\nA repository (such as a PPA) is for publishing your package to the wider world. So, yes, if you want people to be able to install the package, either you need to get it included in Debian/Ubuntu, or you need to publish it in a repository.\nPPAs also have access to the Launchpad build farm, so they can build binary packages from source packages. But you can do this locally, too. And while packaging something, you really want to be test-building locally, rather than waiting for LP to build your package (the LP build queues can be hours long).\n\nDo I need to sign it with my public key or something?\n\nIf you want to upload to a PPA, you need to sign your source package with your private key.\n\nWill one deb package work for all Debian-based distributions, or do I need to build a separate version for each flavour?\n\nThe safe answer is no. But sometimes it's fairly straightforward to produce once deb that will work on all current Debian and Ubuntu releases. It depends on the package and the toolchain you used.\nI suggest:\n\n\n*\n\n*The Ubuntu Packaging Guide\n\n*This introduction to Debian packaging\n\n*The Debian New Maintainer's Guide\n\nA: InkBlend, there is an experimental project on launchpad that aims to make this easier for applications:\nhttps://launchpad.net/pkgme\nThe goal of the project is for it to be very easy for any developer to be able to create a Debian source package from the metadata already included in your source build system.\nThere is an older program called dh_make, which should be included with the 'ubuntu-dev-tools' package, but it is less automatic at figuring out what to do with your source code.\nFinally, this guide is excellent and will explain all of the aspect of packaging:\nhttp://developer.ubuntu.com/packaging/html/\n", "Q: Very low FPS on Chromium with Runescape I'm on Ubuntu 11.10, and I am having trouble with Runescape, an in-browser Java game.\nMy fps used to be 40-50 when I would play on Windows, but now, on Ubuntu I'm at 4-5 fps.

So I really like Shotwell and I've been using it for about half a year now.\nThe only problem, there is no export function, and I grouped all my events and named them.\nIs there any script or plugin out there I could export all of them into a folder structure like 2012_02 Event XY?\n\nA: Okay, since I didn't modify the pictures in Shotwell I'm fine with this little script:\nfrom pysqlite2 import dbapi2 as sqlite\nimport os\nimport shutil\n\ntargetdirectory = \"/home/dan/pictures new/\"\n\ndb = sqlite.connect('photo.db')\ncur = db.cursor()\ncur.execute('SELECT strftime(\"%Y_%m\", datetime(PhotoTable.timestamp, \"unixepoch\")) ||\" \"|| EventTable.name, PhotoTable.filename FROM PhotoTable LEFT JOIN EventTable ON PhotoTable.event_id = EventTable.id')\nfor row in cur:\n\n    dir = os.path.dirname(targetdirectory + str(row[0]) +\"/\")\n    if not os.path.exists(dir):\n            os.makedirs(dir)\n    try:\n        if os.path.exists(str(row[1])) and not os.path.exists(targetdirectory + str(row[0]) + \"/\" + os.path.basename(str(row[1]))):\n            shutil.copyfile(row[1], targetdirectory + str(row[0]) + \"/\" + os.path.basename(row[1]))\n    except UnicodeEncodeError:\n        print \"Error: \" + str(row[0])\n\nI think it is really important to have an option to switch to another tool if you want to :)\n\nA: You cannot export Folders directly however, you can open a Folder> Select all (Ctrl+A) and Export (Shift+Ctrl+E) >    to > Location.

It will dump the whole shotwell media library to a directory.\nCall it like this to match your needs:\nshotwell-export --filename \"{y}_{m} {event}/{file}\"\n\nDisclaimer: it's written/adapted by me. Includes fixes for unicode problems and adds flexibility though arguments.\n\nA: The script mentioned in Robert's post works well,(Thanks much!!) but it looks for a table called BackingPhotoTable which does not always exist (maybe created after photos are modified?) If it does not, the export script will fail.\nThis will create the table and solve the problem. \nCREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS BackingPhotoTable (id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY, filepath TEXT UNIQUE NOT NULL, timestamp INTEGER, filesize INTEGER, width INTEGER, height INTEGER, original_orientation INTEGER, file_format INTEGER, time_created INTEGER)\nThe default path for the photo.db does not seem work, but specifying it in a parameter does.\n", "Q: build wine 32bit from source on ubuntu 12.04 64bit I'm trying to build wine from source. \napt-get build-dep wine installed some dependency packages. When running the configure script, following error occurs:\nchecking for X... no\nconfigure: error: X 32-bit development files not found.

Currently for example the World of Warcraft and Diablo 3 Launchers/Downloaders depend on a patch that has not yet made it into the official wine repository.\nUnfortunately ubuntu does either not ship the according 32-bit development files anymore or they currently cannot co-exist with its 64-bit pendant.\nSee https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/wine1.4/+bug/944321.\n\nA: I've been leveraging pdebuild which is a combination of pbuilder and debuild to build wine i386 on my laptop running Ubuntu 12.04 amd64.\nI would first read through this page to understand what's going on and to setup your pbuilder environment: http://wiki.debian.org/PbuilderTricks\nonce you get things setup, you can pick the latest ppa and build from there:\n$ dget -u -x http://ppa.launchpad.net/ubuntu-wine/ppa/ubuntu/pool/main/w/wine1.5/wine1.5_1.5.9-0ubuntu2~pulse19.dsc\n$ cd wine1.5-1.5.9\n$ DIST=precise ARCH=i386 pdebuild\n\nYou can place patches in the wine1.5-1.5.9/debian/patches directory and add in the file into the wine1.5-1.5.9/debian/patches/series file and also run dch -i to increment the version number on the package before running the pdebuild command to apply your own patches.\nYou could probably just use pbuilder and build wine from trunk as well, but I like to build from deb packages whenever I can.\n\nA: AFAIK, the only way is to use chrooted environment:\nhttp://wiki.winehq.org/WineOn64bit\n\nA: You can download the source code using apt-get source wine1.*. Then cd to the folder, apply packages, and use dpgk to pack everything up again, which makes it compile as well.

I personally thought it could be a wrong design in an extended desktop where in the middle of the desktop, a launcher is present.\nYet, notice that the launcher has new settings :\n\nThe reveal sensitivity allows you to adjust how much the launcher is sensitive to your mouse crossing. The higher, the more you have to push the mouse against the launcher to reveal it.\nWhile auto-hide is activated, and about 27 % of reveal sensitivity, you can surf your mouse from the left external monitor to the right one or the opposite, easily without accidently revealing the launcher.\nCheck the poll, if you want to vote for this option.\nLauncher Poll\n\nA: One good reason is that it's very difficult to implement properly.

The app wanted to partition my drive, didn't know what to do at the time and had to go so I shut it off. Booted it back up and it just went straight into installing windows. Now I do not know how to partition it. Searched through programs and files. I thought it was called Easy Partition or something like that but guess not. When I enter partition it brings up Disk Management no idea what to do. Can someone please help me out? \n\nA: To your first question:\nYes, you should partition your drive. At least a small partition for swap space - rule of thumb: 2 times your real RAM - should be made, at least for hibernation this is recommended.\nSelect linux/swap as partition type.\nFor a desktop system, this might be enough, but a seperate /home partition is often seen. It might be handsome for backup images.\n2nd and 3rd Question:\nYou don't need to download drivers. Drivers are included in the kernel. But you shouldn't, as an unexperienced user, install a beta version. You may install 11.10 and upgrade in April easily.\n\nA: :)\nWell, SAMSUNG default partition includes 3 primary partitions;\n@100MB~ for Windows Loader.\n@Big partition for Windows 7 system.\n@Medium partition for backup.\nHard drives can only get up to 4 primary partitions. An extended partition counts as a primary, but it can include multiple logical partitions. So, in order to maintain your 3 default partitions, use the Ubuntu setup to resize the main and big Windows 7 primary partition, and then make an extended partition on the remaining size. On the extended partition, you can have 3 setups deppending on your needings, if you think that you might need to move the Ubuntu System partition to another sector on the hard drive, a /boot partition is reccommended. If you need to share your /home partition with other Linux distros, you need one. If not, you only need a root / partition, and, as said by @user unknown, a swap partition is reccomended.\nUsing the last stable release, (11.10), is the most reccomended. But you need either a Minimal ISO to get Ubuntu running on the A-Series APU, or a 12.04 build (beta1 recommended).\nGood luck, and don´t forget to ask! ;)\n", "Q: Crashplan on headless server I've Googled a bit and not really found anything out.

The easiest way to check this is to just do ls -ld on them and see what the permissions are, or have them log in locally and try it.\n\n*They have unix access but Samba is blocking it.  Easiest way to find out if this is the case is to look in the Samba logs for messages saying so, and then change it through whichever means you've set up Samba.

You can enable it from Edit -> Plugins, and then add new presets with Music -> New FM Radio Station.\nIt depends on proper video4linux drivers for the tuner hardware, and expects that the card will handle getting audio to the speakers.  I've used it successfully with a tuner that connected through to the line in jack of the sound card.  It was necessary to turn on unmute that input with alsamixer -c0 so that the audio passed through to the speakers, but other than that it worked fine.\nIf your tuner card handles audio in some other way (e.g. it doesn't have a direct connection to the sound card, and instead shows up as a separate sound device), it might not work out of the box though.\n\nA: Gnomeradio is a FM radio tuner for the GNOME desktop. It should work with every FM tuner card that is supported by video4linux. Remote controls are supported via (optional) LIRC support. Gnomeradio can also record radio using GStreamer backend.\n\nA: Does your hardware listed in Ubuntu Hardware compatible list in here if it is yes there should be drivers for it, If it is not, try your hardware vendors web site, browse and find the drivers for Ubuntu-linux, and carefully read instructions and install it (Some media center apps supports those hardware)\n\nA: # fmradio.sh\n# para no confundir con el paquete radio, y modificar estaciones.\n\n: ${DIALOG=dialog}\n: ${DIALOG_SINTONIZAR=0}\n: ${DIALOG_APAGAR=1}\n: ${DIALOG_HELP=2}\n: ${DIALOG_EXTRA=3}\n: ${DIALOG_ITEM_HELP=4}\n: ${DIALOG_ESC=255}\n\ntempfile=`tempfile 2>/dev/null` || tempfile=/tmp/test$$\ntrap \"rm -f $tempfile\" 0 1 2 5 15\n\n\n$DIALOG --clear --title \"SINTONIZADOR DE RADIO FM PERONISTA\" \"$@\" \\\n        --menu \"Elija una emisora:\" 20 50 17 \\\n        \"1\" \"87.9 Radio UBA\" \\\n        \"2\" \"88.3 FM Latinos\" \\\n        \"3\" \"88.5\" \\\n        \"4\" \"89.1 FM Malena\" \\\n        \"5\"  \"89.3 Radio Gráfica\" \\\n        \"6\"  \"89.6\" \\\n        \"7\"  \"89.9 Radio con Vos\" \\\n        \"8\"  \"90.3 FM Delta\" \\\n        \"9\"  \"91.1 Radio Si\" \\\n        \"10\"  \"91.5 Radio Sol\" \\\n        \"11\"  \"92.1 Radio Red\" \\\n        \"12\"  \"92.6\" \\\n        \"13\"  \"92.9\" \\\n        \"14\" \"93.3 FM BitBox\" \\\n        \"15\" \"93.7\" \\\n        \"16\" \"93.9 Radio Palermo\" \\\n        \"17\" \"94.3 Radio Disney\" \\\n        \"18\" \"95.1 Metro\" \\\n        \"19\" \"95.5 FM Concepto\" \\\n        \"20\" \"95.9 FM Rock & Pop\" \\\n        \"21\" \"96.3 Radio Ciudades\" \\\n        \"22\" \"96.7 Nacional Clásica\" \\\n        \"23\" \"97.1 Radio Provincia\" \\\n        \"24\" \"97.5 Vale FM\" \\\n        \"25\" \"97.8 Retro FM\" \\\n        \"26\" \"98.3 Mega FM\" \\\n        \"27\" \"98.7 Nacional Folklórica\" \\\n        \"28\" \"99.1 Cadena 3\" \\\n        \"29\" \"99.9 La Cien\" \\\n        \"30\" \"100.3 La Colifata\" \\\n        \"31\" \"100.7 Radio Blue\" \\\n        \"32\" \"101.1 Radio Latina FM\" \\\n        \"33\" \"101.5 Radio POP\" \\\n        \"34\" \"102.3 FM Aspen\" \\\n        \"35\" \"103.6\" \\\n        \"36\" \"103.7\" \\\n        \"37\" \"103.8 FM OndaSur\" \\\n        \"38\" \"104.3 RQP LRL322\" \\\n        \"39\" \"105.5 FM Hit\" \\\n    \"40\" \"106.2\" \\\n        \"41\" \"106.7 FM Millenium\" \\\n    \"42\" \"107.5\" 2> $tempfile\n\nretval=$?\n\ncase $retval in\n$DIALOG_SINTONIZAR)\nclear\n\n\necho Sintonizando la emisora elegida...\necho De no reproducir active el canal Loopback en Alsamixer\necho y elija otra emisora o seleccione Cancel para detener la radio.\n\ncase `cat $tempfile` in\n1) station='87.90';;\n2) station='88.30';;\n3) station='88.50';;\n4) station='89.10';;\n5) station='89.30';;\n6) station='89.60';;\n7) station='89.90';;\n8) station='90.30';;\n9) station='91.10';;\n10) station='91.50';;\n11) station='92.10';;\n12) station='92.60';;\n13) station='92.90';;\n14) station='93.30';;\n15) station='93.70';;\n16) station='93.90';;\n17) station='94.30';;\n18) station='95.10';;\n19) station='95.50';;\n20) station='95.90';;\n21) station='96.30';;\n22) station='96.70';;\n23) station='97.10';;\n24) station='97.50';;\n25) station='97.80';;\n26) station='98.30';;\n27) station='98.70';;\n28) station='99.10';;\n29) station='99.90';;\n30) station='100.30';;\n31) station='100.70';;\n32) station='101.10';;\n33) station='101.50';;\n34) station='102.30';;\n35) station='103.60';;\n36) station='103.70';;\n37) station='103.80';;\n38) station='104.30';;\n39) station='105.50';;\n40) station='106.20';;\n41) station='106.70';;\n42) station='107.20'\nesac\n;;\n\n$DIALOG_APAGAR)\n     fm off\namixer set 'Loopback Mixing' Disabled\n     clear\necho Cerrando Perón Radio y reproducción detenida.\n     exit 0;;\n\nesac\n\nfm on\namixer set 'Loopback Mixing' Enabled >/dev/null\nexec >/dev/null 2>&1\nfm $station &!\nexec >/dev/tty\n\nexec pradio.sh\nclear\n\n\n", "Q: Thermal Management Issue HP DV7 Computer: HP DV7 6b73nr\nI've been having issues with my computer running hot on Ubuntu and other distros.

I like the snapshot functionality of BTRFS so I can get a system up and running and revert back to in the case something goes wrong, although I'd need a separate /boot partition in this case. Any help would be greatly appreciated...\n\nA: On file systems, I would be looking at simplicity and just use ext3/4 and use some file backup utility to snapshot file contents not drive state.\nIt's not a file system recommendation, but why not use this.\n\nA: I wouldn't put swap on an SSD. If RAM shouldn't be enough look into zram swap and make it higher priority than your SSD swap. That way it swaps only when really needed.\nbtrfs is a really nice choice. To reduce writes on the SSD you can also enable compression (add compress or compress=lzo to your /etc/fstab) should you write to the SSD often. \nAlso imho LVM isn't needed on the SSD.\n", "Q: System won't start Ubuntu 11.10 will not start when I boot to it. When I boot it, it shows the loading screen display, but then goes straight to the shutdown screen and is stuck there. I have tried the recovery mode to no avail. Does anyone have any ideas how to fix the problem?\n\nA: I'd follow Mordoc's advice: Boot from a rescue system, mount /var/log and check the syslog out. Furthermore you should have a look at /boot - I have seen cases where this directory consumed 100 percent of the available partition space and therefore created the strangest errors.\n\nA: To diagnose, I would boot from live-cd or usb and mount the drive. From there, I would navigate to the /var/log/ dir and hunt through the syslog and kern logs.\n", "Q: Can we repack an installed application? I want to install ubuntu on another computer but the computer does not have an internet connection. so i want to move the application from my laptop to the computer. Can we move it?\n\nA: Yes !\nYou can do so with dpkg-repack, which can repack installed applications back into a .deb file. To install it:\nsudo apt-get install dpkg-repack\n\nThen, to use it type\nsudo dpkg-repack <packagename(s)>\n\nWhich will give you a .deb file (or multiple files, if you repacked multiple packages) in the current directory, which you can then install on another computer. Note that this will not repackage any dependencies of the package (you will have to do that yourself), nor will it back up any configuration or personal user data created by the application.\n\nA: No.\nBut, Ubuntu caches most of the downloaded packages under in /var/cache/apt/archives directory.\nYou can copy the content in /var/cache/apt/archives to another Ubuntu Computer's same location, and install the apps without downloading again.\nMake surem that both computers must run the same version of Ubuntu.\nTo automate the entire process, you can use AptOnCD\n", "Q: Is it possible that Ubuntu gets infected with a botnet? I would like to know about Ubuntu and virus/botnets, specifically how likely it is that it could get infected.\n\nA: Yes, it is possible but it can only happen if you either install software from sources that are not worth your trust or if you give away your passwords (and let someone else install software from sources nor worth your trust so basically it is 1 problem ;) ). \nSo if you keep yourself to Ubuntu Software Center and do not download random tar/zip files you are very safe. However, also be aware that some PPAs (personal package archives) could similarly be infected; the fact that they are installed by aptitude does not make them any less of a threat. Be careful if you read a blog and decide you want to add a PPA to your sources list without doing exactly the same level of thoroughness you would with a random tar or zip.\nThat is basically also Windows' problem: people download at random whatever they find on the web. So they are bound to run into programs that have been altered to mail passwords or other things to someone else.\n\nA: In terms of viruses, most of them spread so rampantly on Windows XP because almost everyone logs-in with administrative privileges.  In Ubuntu (Linux), you should never log directly into the system as \"root\" (in fact Ubuntu doesn't let you log in as root, by default).  In this way even if you did download something malicious, it would most-likely infect only the files that your particular user has access to.  I've heard of viruses out there capable of finding their way around the Linux security model, but that's more the very, very rare exception rather than the rule.\nFor those rare times that you absolutely need elevated privileges, you can prefix those commands with \"sudo\" (while in terminal).  But even then, you should exercise caution and take some extra time to think about what you're doing.  Even a good security model doesn't save you from bad system administration.\nIn any case, I've run Fedora and Ubuntu at home for 6 or 7 years now and I've never had a problem with viruses.\n\nA: Of course it is possible. However probability of such event is significantly smaller. Viruses are mostly created for Windows OS. Because of its popularity and fact that most of its users are no Geeks. \nI have installed Ubuntu on my PC at work.

If someone knows the answer, please write a step by step for me and all the other noobs who screw up.  \n\nA: Gparted can resize partitions. The Problem is it can't resize the running system. So the simplest way is to boot from USB or CD - just use whatever you installed Ubuntu from - and run Gparted from there. Then it should be no problem to shrink the Windows 7 ntfs partition and make Ubuntus ext4 one bigger.\n", "Q: Using on-board graphics + PCI together? \nPossible Duplicate:\nHow well will Nvidia Optimus cards be supported in 12.04? \n\nI would like to know if it is possible in 10.04.4 LTS to have both an Intel on-board graphics and a nvidia card working their own screen.

Anyway, when I have several windows opened, and I close the one on top, the window immediately under the \"x\" button raises.\nI would like that the system respect the \"order\" of the windows instead.\nHere is an example: I have a top window, a middle window, and a background terminal:\n\nIf I close the window, I obtain the terminal on top, instead of the middle window. This happens because the terminal is just under the \"x\" of the top window. \n\nIt was more logical (and if was like that, before Unity), to obtain the middle window on top instead of of the terminal, like that:\n\nThis is particularly annoying with maximized background applications. Someone knows how to obtain (again) this effect? it is particular disturbing if there is a maximized application and several little windows on it.\nMoreover, if focus-follows-mouse is enabled, it is possible to remove/rename desktop icons only if the desktop is completely free.\n\nA: I suggest also turning off /apps/metacity/general/auto_raise.\nThe focus will still go to the \"other\" window, but the windows' stacking order remains the same, which makes it easier to refocus on the (new) fully exposed top window (just move the mouse over it, of course).\n", "Q: Keyboard shortcuts get randomly reset I'm facing a rather weird issue in the past few days after doing a clean install of Ubuntu Oneiric (w/ gnome-shell) on my recently-bought Asus U36SD.\nI set up my keyboard shortcuts using System Settings > Keyboard > Shortcuts, and some of them get randomly reset.\nMost of my shortcuts include the win key (otherwise listed in the keyboard shortcuts as Mod4), but those containing only Mod4 +  get reset every two-three reboots.\nFor instance, Mod4 + T (for terminal), gets reset to the standard Ctrl + Alt + T, while Shift + Mod4 + W (for browser) doesn't (I've set up the latter with the Shift key, because it seems that Mod4 + W didn't get intercepted at all.

My Ubuntu 11.10 desktop has an option to suspend when inactive (under System Settings > Power) but no option to hibernate.   How can I hibernate it after a period of inactivity?\n\nA: I'd imagine since its a desktop it sleeps instead of hibernates, it looks like laptop users have the opposite problem,\nSleep Instead of Hibernate When Idle\nSo for your case we would change the value for \"sleep_type_ac\" to hibernate when following the article. Hope this does the trick.\nSimplified steps:\n\n\n*\n\n*Open a terminal, and run gconf-editor or a short cut to run programs hit Alt+f2 and type gconf-editor this will open up the configuration editor\n\n*Find /apps/gnome-power-manager/actions/ by using the + icons and folders on the left sidebar, so first find \"apps\" then \"gnome-power-manager\" within the \"apps\" folder, and finally \"actions\" within that.\n\n*Within \"actions\"  look for sleep_type_battery and sleep_type_ac in the main window. Which in your case the value would be set to suspend double click suspend and change it to hibernate for which one you want to set to hibernate.\n\nA: Since later versions of Ubuntu use dconf instead of gconf, Mateo's answer is out-of-date. To edit these same settings in dconf, do the following:\n\n*\n\n*First, run\n $ gsettings list-recursively org.gnome.settings-daemon.plugins.power | grep sleep-inactive\n\nand take note of the different values: there is a timeout and type for each of A/C power and battery power. The type is one of 'suspend' or 'hibernate'. The timeout is the number of seconds of inactivity before suspending.\n\n\n*In System Settings (gnome-control-center), choose power, and set the timeout to some unique value; I chose 2 hours (7200 seconds), since both battery-timeout and ac-timeout were set to disabled (0) previously.\n\n\n*Now, run the command in step 1 again. Check which timeout changed. For my desktop computer it was the battery timeout, so pay close attention.\n\n\n*Modify the \"sleep\" type which corresponds to the timeout you modified in step 2.

This will be applied in 2 places, a LAN in my home and in another place I work. I wish to use a Web Cache but it has to be up to date. At most a year behind the latest but not more.\nFor this I will also be using Apache as the HTTP server (For the work place) but for home we just one something that when we connect for a second time to a site it would load faster that site.

But the next time the cache should load the site much faster for all PCs in the home.\nNOTE - Edited to correct the name. It should be a forward proxy, not a reverse proxy since I will not install a web server, only a proxy between clients and internet.\n\nA: The official Ubuntu web proxy caching server is named squid!\n\nSquid is a full-featured web proxy cache server application which provides proxy and cache services for Hyper Text Transport Protocol (HTTP), File Transfer Protocol (FTP), and other popular network protocols. Squid can implement caching and proxying of Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) requests and caching of Domain Name Server (DNS) lookups, and perform transparent caching. Squid also supports a wide variety of caching protocols, such as Internet Cache Protocol, (ICP) the Hyper Text Caching Protocol, (HTCP) the Cache Array Routing Protocol (CARP), and the Web Cache Coordination Protocol. (WCCP)\nThe Squid proxy cache server is an excellent solution to a variety of proxy and caching server needs, and scales from the branch office to enterprise level networks while providing extensive, granular access control mechanisms and monitoring of critical parameters via the Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP). When selecting a computer system for use as a dedicated Squid proxy, or caching servers, ensure your system is configured with a large amount of physical memory, as Squid maintains an in-memory cache for increased performance.\n\nInstallation is as easy as typing...\nsudo apt-get install squid\n(then all you need is to configure it ... and that can take care of the rest of your life since it got 1000s of options ;-) )\n\n*\n\n*Ubuntu serverguide\n\n*Ubuntu community page\n\n*Official website\nThere is also squidguard that can help with content filtering and access if you also need something like that (best method to lower bandwith consumption is to block access to certain websites ;) )\n\nA: Apart for the nice one mentioned by Rinzwind, in Ubuntu 12.04 I found:\nVarnish\nVarnish is a web application accelerator.

In contrast to other HTTP accelerators, such as Squid, which began life as a client-side cache, or Apache and nginx, which are primarily origin servers, Varnish was designed from the ground up as an HTTP accelerator.

I'm running 11.10 and am trying to apply the fix to this bug in Empathy, shown at the very bottom. There is an updated package for the offending component available in the Precise repository, and someone even posted a backported .deb package for use on Oneiric. However, when I try to install that package, it seems to have a dependency on a package that isn't available for Oneiric:\n(Reading database ... 254452 files and directories currently installed.)\nPreparing to replace telepathy-indicator 0.0.7-0ubuntu1 (using telepathy-indicator_0.1.1-0ubuntu1_amd64.deb) ...\nUnpacking replacement telepathy-indicator ...\ndpkg: dependency problems prevent configuration of telepathy-indicator:\n telepathy-indicator depends on libunity9 (>= 3.4.6); however:\n  Package libunity9 is not installed.\ndpkg: error processing telepathy-indicator (--install):\n dependency problems - leaving unconfigured\nErrors were encountered while processing:\n telepathy-indicator\n\nThe person who posted the backported telepathy-indicator package indicated that it depends upon libunity-dev-5.0; the latest version in the Oneiric repositories is a 4.0 vintage. I also can't find a libunity9 available for Oneiric, so I'm wondering: is it possible to just add the Precise repository to my list and pull the updated packages from there, or should I not expect that they would operate correctly?\n\nA: I'm pretty sure that it would operate correctly. However, I strictly discourage you from doing so.\nThe point is that adding these repositories is almost exactly the same as upgrading to 12.04. Indeed, when you click the 'upgrate to precise' button, the only thing that gets done (except for several scripts) is that Precise repositories are added to your system, and then it continues as a normal update, which pulls all newer packages from Precise repository.\nYou won't find libunity9 (Unity 5) on Oneiric. You won't be able to install that manually too, because it has tons of dependencies that will never be met on Oneiric.\nThis said, your only chance to install that particular .deb package is to forcefully use the precise repository. However, instead of adding this repository manually, use the Distribution Upgrade option to upgrade to Precise, as it will ensure you will have a smooth, safer upgrade.\n\nAs a side note, consider notifying the appropriate person about your problem, I am prety sure one can backport this fix to Oneiric in a proper manner, so that it won't have such unmet dependencies.\n", "Q: Nvidia 555M driver installation problem with a Lenovo Y570 I am trying to install the Nvidia 555M driver on my Lenovo Y570.

I am trying to find diffs between all files of same names across two copies of a directory (say a working and a backup). For example, I can diff two files of same name in both:\n> diff d1/f.cpp d2/f.cpp\nor I can find differences across the directories:\n> diff d1 d2\nbut how can I find differences between the *.cpp files only?\n> diff d1/*.cpp d2/*.cpp\ndoes not seem to work (for obvious reasons).\n[It is probably easy to solve with loops, but I am trying to find a more elegant way]\n\nA: Some time after asking the question, I found out the meld diff utility, and am using it since then. This is a great piece of GUI based program that makes comparison and merge between files and directory a very easy task. It does two- or three-way compares.\nSpecifically, it answers my original question in that it shows you a color-coded comparison of the directory contents, and lets you compare specific files by a double-click on the file name.\nIf one needs more than a three-way comparison, then gvimdiff (based on the vim editor) is a great too as well that provides this functionality.\n\nA: diff -qr {DIR1} {DIR2} does all files in both directories.\n\n\n*\n\n*q shows only differences\n\n*r does recursive. Leave it out if you do not need that\n\n\nYou can not tell diff directly to use wildcards but you can add:\n-x PAT  --exclude=PAT\n    Exclude files that match PAT.\n\n-X FILE    --exclude-from=FILE\n   Exclude files that match any pattern in FILE.\n\nto exclude files. So if you only want *.cpp the easiest method is to create a textfile that lists all the files that are not *.cpp. You can do this with the following command:\nls -I \"*.cpp\" > excluded_files where the -I \"*.cpp\" argument ignores all the .cpp files. Note that the quotation marks are necessary.\n\nA: You can use a shell loop that runs diff for each file, though this will not catch the cases where d2 contains a file, but d1 doesn't. It might be sufficient though.\nfor file in d1/*.cpp; do\n    diff \"$file\" \"d2/${file##*/}\"\ndone\n\nOr all on one line:\nfor file in d1/*.cpp; do diff \"$file\" \"d2/${file##*/}\"; done\n\nThe ${file##*/} part is a special parameter expansion. \nIf the file variable contains d1/hello.cpp, then \"${file##*/}\" will expand to hello.cpp (the value of file, but with everything up to, and including, the last / removed). \nSo \"d2/${file##*/}\" will result in d2/hello.cpp and the resulting diff command is thus diff d1/hello.cpp d2/hello.cpp\nSee http://mywiki.wooledge.org/BashFAQ/100 for more on string manipulations in bash.\nOn a side note, a version control system (such as subversion, git, mercurial etc...) would make this type of diffing much easier.\n\nA: There's a lightweight solution for that:\n\n\n*\n\n*Set up this tiny plugin http://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=5309\n\n*Do diff dir1 dir2 | vim -R - at shell\n\n\nIt will add folds and side-by-side comparison for changed files.\n", "Q: How can I stop my CD drive ejecting?

It looks like it locks after checking for the battery. \nIs there anyway, with or without Live media, to restore my machine's install/update to 12.04 but still keep my settings/applications/files?\n\nA: Did you try booting into the recovery mode (selected via grub)?  You could then try to restart the upgrade with\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get upgrade\n\nYou may need to run\nsudo dpkg --configure -a\n\nto fix the partially installed packages.\nIf the recovery mode is also broken, you could try booting off a live cd and then chroot'ing into your hard drive installation and performing the above steps.\nTo chroot into your hard drive installation, first boot off a live cd.  You can use the ubuntu install CD for this task, just choose the option \"try ubuntu\" rather than installing.  Once booted, open a terminal and mount your root partition.

I am using the precise beta and totally hate the new qt based ubuntu one control panel. I would like to switch back to the old, pretty, gtk based control panel, and expect that it would still work. However, I don't know how to install the old control panel from the oneiric repo without manually installing all dependencies from the ground up. How can I install it without dependency checks?\n\nA: The old ubuntuone-control-panel-gtk code is no longer available in the trunk source tree, or in the Ubuntu archive. The package is now a transitional package, so that people upgrading from older versions of Ubuntu to 12.04 will automatically get the ubuntuone-control-panel-qt package installed (as it is not part of the default install, due to CD size limitations), rather than having the ubuntuone-installer pop up asking them to install Ubuntu One again.\nIf you really must have the older version, you can tell apt to install a specific version of a package like:\n\nsudo apt-get install ubuntuone-control-panel-gtk=2.99.5-0ubuntu2\n\nIf it is still in the archive or your local apt packages cache (packages apt has downloaded before), it should install it. You can also download the older package from Launchpad and install it directly, with gdebi, dpkg, or similar. However, be aware that installing the older control panel will break system integration, and is totally unsupported.

It has a list with programs and scripts and the exact dates or intervals that they should run. Crontab is used a lot by system administrators for making backups and automating tasks. \nTo see the list with the programs you can type\ncrontab -l\n\nTo edit the list type\ncrontab -e\n\nAdd this line in the end, to boot redshift whenever computer starts up\n@reboot export DISPLAY=:0.0 && /usr/bin/redshift -l 56.20:16.35\n\nwhere 56.20:16.35 is the LATITUDE:LONGITUTE of your location.\nSave and reboot.\nUPSTART\nUpstart is a program that amongst other things, looks in specific folders at bootup for scripts to be run. So we can just add our program in there to have it run in every booutup. Upstart is more low-level than crontab and you need root privileges.\nTo add redshift you simply have to edit /etc/rc.local file. Add the path to redshift before the exit in the file or else it won't run. You can find the path by typing whereis redshift.

For LightDM, this would be a file at /etc/lightdm/lightdm.conf.d/90-redshift.conf:\n[Seat:*]\ndisplay-setup-script=/usr/local/bin/redshift.sh\n\n\nA: Another one way is to set up startup command for redshift with manually specified lon:lat like:\nredshift-gtk -l xx:yy\n\nwhere xx - latitude, yy - longitude\nStartup Application Screen:\n\nTested on Ubuntu 14.04LTS\n\nA: Create the file ~/.xprofile with the following content:\n#!/bin/sh\nsleep 10 && redshift -PO 4200 &\n\nThe xprofile is executed at the beginning of the X user session, after you log in to the graphical shell (Unity or Gnome).\nThe command redshift -PO 4200 sets the temperature to 4200K.\nYou can test the script by logging out and then logging in.\n", "Q: Emacs-AUCTeX-Okular I have Tex live 2011 installed with Emacs 23. AUCTeX and Okular. I have also configured Emacs/AUCTeX to work with Okular supporting forward and inverse search.\nBut. Here's my question. If I have Emacs and Okular docked side by side and when I click on Okular, the cursor is taken to Emacs. But. If I have Okular and Emacs in two maximized windows, and when I click Okular, the Emacs window is not brought up to the front.\nHave I configured SyncTeX correctly or is this how it is supposed to work?\n\nA: I came across the same problem today on Ubuntu 12.04. The main problem is that the Emacs window is not brought to front.\nI am using Ubuntu 12.04 with Emacs/AucTex/Okular/TexLive 2011. I found that if I press Shift+LeftMouse twice in Okular, the Emacs window will be brought front. So this can be seen as a workaround.\nYou could also configure the Custom Text-Editor in Okular. \nFirst install xdotool\nsudo apt-get install xdotool\n\nThen save the following script\n#!/bin/bash                                                                     \nemacsclient -a emacs --no-wait +$1 $2\n\nfs=$2\nfilename=$(basename \"$fs\")\npathname=$(dirname \"$fs\")\nxdotool search --name $filename windowactivate\n\nThe script will first call emacsclient, then bring a window whose title contains the filename of the TeX source to front.\nMake the script executable and write the following command (don't include ~ in your path) in the Custom Text-Editor in Okular.\n<absolute-path-to-script> %l %f\n\nHope it works.\n", "Q: How to have the HUD search all resources? On the 12.04 Beta, if you click on the alt key, HUD appears and on bottom of the screen you have four icons. There's an arrow pointing down onto the HOME icon by default. If you start typing you can only see what's available within that resource. If you wanted to search for videos you have to click on the video icon and then type in your query. Is there a way to have it search ALL resources? I'd like to be less mouse dependent.\nWhen you do get results, is there a way to assign a number to the results? I can move the cursor down and once I've highlighted it hit enter but assigning a number would get to the result faster.\n\nA: In 12.04, you can have Unity search all your files, rather than just ones that have been logged by zeitgeist, by adding the lense testing ppa and new unity lens files:\nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:unity-team/lenses-testing\nsudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install unity-lens-files\n\n", "Q: How do I use the GUI to search for files in GNOME? On the command line I regularly use locate, or more often a locate x | grep y pattern to find a file I know exists but can't find!\nI'd like something that did this quickly in the GUI. Can't find it if it's there.\nHere's my confusion\n\n\n*\n\n*In the applications/overview I can see Search and Indexing. This seems to be a configuration tool. But if this is a server, I can't find a client.\n\n*In applications I find Nepomuk File Indexing -- I think this is a KDE thing? Ditto, no client?\n\n*I've installed tracker. This is a strange mix of powerful and unreliable/limited. e.g. it doesn't find files like locate does (returns no results where locate returns 96 results), but is will unpack every tag I've added to my photos! And you can't limit by folder for a quick search within a folder.\n\n*The old Gnome 2 Search for files... thing is not in the Accessories menu anymore.\nI feel that this is basic/core-level functionality and I can't help feeling I'm missing something obvious.\n\nA: There are several ways you can do this.\n\n\n*\n\n*Open Files and click the Search button. This is the easiest and recommended choice since it's installed by default.\n\n*Or you can install gnome-search-tool \n\n*Or you can install tracker-gui \n\nA: I was also looking for this myself as I find Unity too slow (Ubuntu 12.10). Best thing I've found so far is Synapse. Ctrl + Spacebar to activate once installed.\n\nA: Catfish\nYou can also install catfish package (written in Python):\n\nCatfish is a search GUI powered by locate and find behind the scenes, with autocompletion from Zeitgeist and locate.
