["Q: How can I execute c programs in ubuntu 13.04 I upgraded my ubuntu to 13.04 version. After this upgrade I am not able to execute c programs in terminal. When I try to execute, it shows an error as shown below\nbash: ./cd: Permission denied\n\nwhere cd is my executable file which is working fine in lower versions of ubuntu.\n\nA: First you have to know what are the permissions.\nto know the permissions, type the below code in your terminal.\nls -lh\n\nor\nls -l\n\nthen it'll shows the permissions of all files like below. choose your file permissions.\n-rw-r--r-- \nyou have to organize those into 4 parts.\nparts:  1       2        3        4\n     +--------------------------------+\n     |  -  | r w -  |  r - x | - - -  |  (r: Read, w: Write, x: Executable, -: No perm)\n     +--------------------------------+\nperm:         ROOT     USER     GROUP    \n\n\n\n*\n\n*1st part indicates file type. \"-\" means regular. \"d\" means directory, \"p\" for pipe e.t.c..\n\n*2nd part indicates ROOT permissions. In my example, it is \"r w -\". it means root have read and write permsissions, but not executable permissions.\n\n*3rd part is for USER permissions. here we can see \"r - x\". it means user have read, executable permissions but not write permissions.\n\n*4th part indicates permissions of GROUP. here group have \"- - -\". so it don't have any permissions.\n\n\nYou are getting error \"Permission denied\". \"cd\" is your executable file. It requires executable permission(x). \nTo change permissions of a file:\nIn your case you may don't have executable permission. for that try below caode\nchmode +x <filename>      (eg: chmode +x cd   //here cd is your filename)\n\nyou can also assign other permissions by replacing \"x\" with \"r\"(read) or \"w\"(write).\nto verify again use \nls -l (or) ls -lh.\n\nNote: If \"chmod\" returns an error like \"operation not permitted\" then try \n               sudo chmod +x <filename> (eg: sudo chmod +x cd)\n\nfor more about permissions:\n              man chmod\n\n\nA: Be sure that your cd is realy executable using the following command:\nchmod +x cd\n\n\nA: It looks to me like you're trying to execute built-in commands in the terminal (such as \"cd\"). Instead of prefacing them with a \"./\", call them just as \"cd\" from the command line.\nI may be misunderstanding your query, but hopefully that works. Otherwise, follow one of the answers above that involves assigning the executable bit to the file and try running it that way.\n", "Q: Desktop icons missing after \"logging on\" to 13.04 So I signed in to my Ubuntu 13.04 (dual booted) computer today and I noticed something strange, the unity lancher had appeared as soon as I signed in, but sign in box has stayed where it is and not disappeared, along with the Ubuntu logo and white dots all over the screen. In addition to this my desktop icons have disappeared.\nAny advice as how I could go about getting rid of the login screen and retrieve my icons?\nCheers.\n\nA: create a file with that content:\n#!/bin/bash\ndconf reset -f /org/compiz/\nunity --reset-icons\n\nSave it under any name.\nThen go to settings of that file (2nd tab) and make it executable, then double click and run it in a terminal.\nKeep that file on desktop if it occurs again...\nEDIT\nto get rid of the login screen you just have to go the the system settings, go to user, and change to automatic login\n", "Q: Icons on the desktop do not state the name of the file/directory?

I didn't know that I had to fix the 'mbr'.  \nNow every time I try to boot the computer the grub menu pops up and says that the partition  cannot be found. I made an ubuntu dvd but it doesn't turn on automatically and I have no clue how to do it manually. \nPlease help me, I have no clue what to do.\nCould someone at least tell me how to retrieve data or documents.\n\nA: If your PC manufacturer gave you a Windows installation CD, you can use it to Repair your current Windows installation (don't re-install, or you'll lose everything).  If you want to get your data onto another drive, or reinstall Ubuntu, you can use the Ubuntu CD you said you have.\nBooting your computer from a CD can be a different process depending on the manufacturer, and the BIOS version.  I suggest searching for how to boot from cd on [computer manufacturer/model number here], so you can get some specific help.  Tip: Most of the time, you can press F2 before the BIOS hands control to GRUB, and you'll get the CMOS settings page.  From there, you can change the boot order so that CD will be the default.\nEdit: Yes, this is absolutely a duplicate of How to remove Ubuntu, but Windows back on.\n", "Q: Ssh X11 forwarding very slow using Xshell My server is Ubuntu 12.10 \nAnd my client is Windows 7 64bit\nNow I am using Xshell to connect my server via ssh\nBut after I forwarding X11, it's take a long time!!\nafter I enter\n$matlab -nodesktop\n\nit's almost take 5~10 mins to ready for use\nI have found some speed up issue on the web but it's work on MAC not on windows(Xshell)!\nfollowing is solution for mac and it's worked perfect!\nssh -c arcfour,blowfish-cbc -XC username@host\n\nBut when I use Xshell it's always think  -c arcfour,blowfish-cbc -XC usernameis my username!\nIs there any other way to make it faster?\n\nA: First of all you should read ssh manpage.\n-C (capital) enable zlib compression, this means server and client will spend time doing \n   data compression/decompression. Since you want to speed up and - i guess - bandwith is \n   not a problem you should not use it \n-c arcfour,blowfish-cbc is to specify a different cipher to encrypt. while those cipher \n   could be faster,they are known to be insecure. Unless you know what you are doing you \n   should not use them\nLast, those are option for ssh not xshell which is a totally different program\n", "Q: CD/DVD launcher will not show up I accidentally clicked the Unlock from Launcher instead of eject.

One of these is ttf-mscorefonts-installer, which is what's actually downloading these .exe files.  These are commonly used for Wine applications.\nTo install just Flash, use apt-get install libflashplugin-installer.  To see which other packages would be installed if you did go with all the restricted extras, you can do a dry-run without actually installing them - apt-get -s install ubuntu-restricted-extras.\n\nA: These fonts were originally released by Microsoft as executable installers, and their license only allows \"complete copies\" to be distributed:\n\nReproduction and Distribution. You may reproduce and distribute an unlimited number of copies of the SOFTWARE PRODUCT; provided that each copy shall be a true and complete copy, including all copyright and trademark notices, and shall be accompanied by a copy of this EULA. Copies of the SOFTWARE PRODUCT may not be distributed for profit either on a standalone basis or included as part of your own product.\n\nUbuntu's package doesn't actually contain a copy of the fonts, but rather a script that downloads the original Windows executables from a third-party archive. The script then extracts and installs the fonts without actually running the executables.\nIt's a convoluted arrangement, but that's what happens when software is released with restrictive licensing.\n", "Q: Unable find package linux-header-3.2.46 Linux-header package is not installed.\nroot@pc-4:~# apt-cache policy linux-headers-3.2.46\nN: Couldn't find any package by regex 'linux-headers-3.2.46'\nroot@pc-4:~#\nroot@pc-4:~#\n\nUnable to install packages\n\nroot@pc-4:~# apt-get install linux-headers-3.2.46\nReading package lists...

In Ubuntu, I could connect to the Internet using wired network only. I am new to Ubuntu. Please, let me know how to troubleshoot the problem step by step.

I've read that the x230 requires a lenovo specific wireless card, so I was initially worried that it was something to do with this, but I got it working just fine under Windows 7 (after installing the drivers through the lenovo tool).\nThe card is visible with lspci and iwlwifi is loaded.\nsudo ifconfig wlan0 up yields:\nwlan0: ERROR while getting interface flags: No such device\n\nlspci -vv yields the following:\nDevCap: MaxPayload 128 bytes, PhantFunc 0, Latency L0s <512ns, L1 unlimited\n            ExtTag- AttnBtn- AttnInd- PwrInd- RBE+ FLReset+\n        DevCtl: Report errors: Correctable- Non-Fatal- Fatal- Unsupported-\n            RlxdOrd+ ExtTag- PhantFunc- AuxPwr- NoSnoop+ FLReset-\n            MaxPayload 128 bytes, MaxReadReq 128 bytes\n        DevSta: CorrErr+ UncorrErr- FatalErr- UnsuppReq+ AuxPwr+ TransPend-\n        LnkCap: Port #0, Speed 2.5GT/s, Width x1, ASPM L0s L1, Latency L0 <4us, L1 <32us\n            ClockPM+ Surprise- LLActRep- BwNot-\n        LnkCtl: ASPM L1 Enabled; RCB 64 bytes Disabled- Retrain- CommClk+\n            ExtSynch- ClockPM+ AutWidDis- BWInt- AutBWInt-\n        LnkSta: Speed 2.5GT/s, Width x1, TrErr- Train- SlotClk+ DLActive- BWMgmt- ABWMgmt-\n    Capabilities: [100 v1] Advanced Error Reporting\n        UESta:  DLP- SDES- TLP- FCP- CmpltTO- CmpltAbrt- UnxCmplt- RxOF- MalfTLP- ECRC- UnsupReq- ACSViol-\n        UEMsk:  DLP- SDES- TLP- FCP- CmpltTO- CmpltAbrt- UnxCmplt- RxOF- MalfTLP- ECRC- UnsupReq- ACSViol-\n        UESvrt: DLP+ SDES- TLP- FCP+ CmpltTO- CmpltAbrt- UnxCmplt- RxOF+ MalfTLP+ ECRC- UnsupReq- ACSViol-\n        CESta:  RxErr- BadTLP- BadDLLP- Rollover- Timeout- NonFatalErr+\n        CEMsk:  RxErr- BadTLP- BadDLLP- Rollover- Timeout- NonFatalErr+\n        AERCap: First Error Pointer: 00, GenCap- CGenEn- ChkCap- ChkEn-\n    Capabilities: [140 v1] Device Serial Number 00-15-00-ff-ff-62-df-09\n    Kernel driver in use: iwlwifi\n\nI'm completely mystified on this one.

There are many doc packages in the repositories which provide documentation in HTML.\nIs there an easy way to find locally installed HTML documentation, like info or man?\nI guess I should clarify this a little.\nThe question is not about opening an HTML file. There are plenty of browsers out there and they do it pretty well.\nThe question is about working with the whole farm of documentation files on my computer, HTML docs in particular.\nAmong /usr/share/doc/* there are man pages, info files, some plain text files and a bunch of HTML files.\nTo look up information in man pages we use man utility, or info -- it looks through man too. But the situation with HTML docs is like if you had man pages on your computer but no man utility!\nSo, since there are HTML docs, there also could be a tool to work with them (to search for the documentation you need etc <-- and would be nice to have fuzzy search for that). Does such a tool exist?\n\nA: you can view the local .html with any browser. \n\nA: For the moment, no. You need to manually search using *.html | grep \"what you want\". The man and info utilities have their own databases maintained which is not the case of HTML documents.\n\nA: The tools to browse local documentation are dhelp, dwww and some more (yelp in Gnome). You can find more of them in the wiki of the doc-base package.\ndoc-base registers documentation on the computer and all those programs are clients of this information.\nAlso, you can always navigate your broweser to: file:///usr/share/doc/ or any other directory and view html files from there. This way you avoid hassle with opening browser each time.\n", "Q: Cannot figure out how to change username through recovery mode or terminal? I am giving my old laptop to my brother and am trying to change everything to his name. I have tried every online tutorial I could find and nothing has worked so far. I need to change allie@Nolan's Machine:~$ to Nolan@Nolan's Machine:~$\n\nA: Changing the name of a user is not such an easy task as it may seem, especially when the user should have administrative privileges. Depending on how experienced you are on the command line you could try the steps outlined in answers to this question:\n\n\n*\n\n*How do I change my username?\nBut be warned. In case some references to the old username could not be resolved hard to track down issues may result.\nTherefore I would go with a much safer approach:\n\n\n*\n\n*Create a new user \"nolan\" with User Accounts from System Settings (unlock to be able to).\n\n*Make this account an \"Administrator\".\n\n*Log in as \"nolan\" to copy all data files or settings you want to keep from /home/allie/.\n\n*Then disable (do not delete) the old account allie by clicking on the password in User Accounts settings (also needs to be unlocked first).\n\n\n*Let your brother use the laptop for a while to see if there are any issues.\n\n*If all is fine (and only then) you can safely delete the old home directory /home/allie.\n\n\nMost if not all applications you had installed will be installed system wide. That is your new user will also have access to these. Only the individual settings for each application will have to be adapted either manually or by copying settings from your old account (look out for the hidden \"dot-files\" in your home directory or for files in ~/.config).\n", "Q: LTS 12.04 update NVIDIA driver 319.32 reconfigured not able to get past login screen I've encountered a similar problem as \nNvidia driver updated - mixed versions of 304.88 and 319.32\nand\nUbuntu 12.04 LTS - Black Screen at boot After changing Nvidia Driver\nUsing what I found there, I was able to purge the nvidia version 304 and reconfigure version 319.

Short summary (added after the problem was solved)\nApparently some wireless USB network adapter drivers were incompatible with my Linux OS, and in the end I worked around the problem by buying a wireless bridge ~= receiver ~= wireless access point. Now, here is the actual question:\nQuestion:\nIf a computer has been provided an IP address by a broadband router, and the firewall is turned off, but internet nevertheless doesn't work and it's not even possible to ping the router, then what might the problem be? And how can I fix it?\nBackground:\nI'm unable to connect from my desktop to [the wireless broadband router in the\nappartment to which I've just moved], via [a wireless network USB card]. \nThe router gives me an IP address (first it asks me to specify a WSP PIN code, which I do), but although I get an IP address, I'm unable to reach the Internet: I cannot resove any host names, and I cannot even ping the broadband router, i.e. the machine that gave me the IP address (!).\nMore information:\nBelow follows lots of hopefully helpful information.\nMy laptop, which has always been configured via DHCP, is able to connect to\nthe broadband router without any issues.

It recently had bridged networking configured.\nHere are my desktop's interfaces, after I've connected it to the broadband router. wlan0 (at the end of the list) is the network USB card.\n$ ip ad\n1: lo: <LOOPBACK,UP,LOWER_UP> mtu 16436 qdisc noqueue state UNKNOWN \n    link/loopback 00:00:00:00:00:00 brd 00:00:00:00:00:00\n    inet 127.0.0.1/8 scope host lo\n    inet6 ::1/128 scope host \n       valid_lft forever preferred_lft forever\n2: eth0: <NO-CARRIER,BROADCAST,MULTICAST,UP> mtu 1500 qdisc pfifo_fast state DOWN qlen 1000\n    link/ether 20:cf:30:4c:2f:02 brd ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff\n    inet6 fe80::22cf:30ff:fe4c:2f02/64 scope link \n       valid_lft forever preferred_lft forever\n\n(Uninteresting stuff related to KVM, VMWare, VirtualBox:\n4: virbr0: <NO-CARRIER,BROADCAST,MULTICAST,UP> mtu 1500 qdisc noqueue state DOWN \n    link/ether 6e:84:3c:57:95:4a brd ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff\n    inet 192.168.122.1/24 brd 192.168.122.255 scope global virbr0\n5: vmnet1: <BROADCAST,MULTICAST,UP,LOWER_UP> mtu 1500 qdisc pfifo_fast state UNKNOWN qlen 1000\n    link/ether 00:50:56:c0:00:01 brd ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff\n    inet 172.16.228.1/24 brd 172.16.228.255 scope global vmnet1\n    inet6 fe80::250:56ff:fec0:1/64 scope link \n       valid_lft forever preferred_lft forever\n6: vmnet8: <BROADCAST,MULTICAST,UP,LOWER_UP> mtu 1500 qdisc pfifo_fast state UNKNOWN qlen 1000\n    link/ether 00:50:56:c0:00:08 brd ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff\n    inet 192.168.133.1/24 brd 192.168.133.255 scope global vmnet8\n    inet6 fe80::250:56ff:fec0:8/64 scope link \n       valid_lft forever preferred_lft forever\nEND uninteresting stuff)\n\n9: wlan0: <BROADCAST,MULTICAST,UP,LOWER_UP> mtu 1500 qdisc mq state UP qlen 1000\n    link/ether 44:94:fc:29:59:6e brd ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff\n    inet 192.168.100.6/24 brd 192.168.100.255 scope global wlan0  <-- it has an IP addr (!)\n    inet6 fe80::4694:fcff:fe29:596e/64 scope link \n       valid_lft forever preferred_lft forever\n\nHere is the routing table: (192.168.100.* is the broadband router's network)\n$ route\nKernel IP routing table\nDestination     Gateway         Genmask         Flags Metric Ref    Use Iface\ndefault         192.168.100.1   0.0.0.0         UG    0      0        0 wlan0\nlink-local      *               255.255.0.0     U     1000   0        0 wlan0\n172.16.228.0    *               255.255.255.0   U     0      0        0 vmnet1\n192.168.100.0   *               255.255.255.0   U     2      0        0 wlan0\n192.168.122.0   *               255.255.255.0   U     0      0        0 virbr0\n192.168.133.0   *               255.255.255.0   U     0      0        0 vmnet8\n\nHere is the iptables configuration: (it's disabled, right?)\n$ sudo iptables -nL\nChain INPUT (policy ACCEPT)\ntarget     prot opt source               destination         \n\nChain FORWARD (policy ACCEPT)\ntarget     prot opt source               destination         \n\nChain OUTPUT (policy ACCEPT)\ntarget     prot opt source               destination         \n\nWhen I ping the gateway (192.168.100.1), and Google, ping says:\n$ ping 192.168.100.1\nPING 192.168.100.1 (192.168.100.1) 56(84) bytes of data.\nFrom 192.168.100.6 icmp_seq=3 Destination Host Unreachable\nFrom 192.168.100.6 icmp_seq=5 Destination Host Unreachable\nFrom 192.168.100.6 icmp_seq=6 Destination Host Unreachable\n\n$ ping google.com\nping: unknown host google.com\n\nHow is that possible? 192.168.100.1 has given me an IP address, then it cannot\nbe \"unreachable\"?

For some reason your DHCP (?) offers localhost instead of a valid DNS or maybe Network Manager was set to do so. I would go to network manager configuration tool, right click to the network applet besides your username, select Network Settings, look for your wireless devices, click Options... button in the corner. Go to the ipv4 tab and check the DNS entries. If the method says \"Automatic (DHCP)\" and the DNS field I would blame a broken DHCP server. Change the method to \"Automatic (DHCP) addresses only\" and use another DNS servers (Google's, OpenDNS's, etc).\nIf the value indeed has 127.0.0.1 then maybe someone would like to play you a bad joke, remove the entry, set your Method in automatic and ready to go.\n\nA: The wireless USB network adapter apparently requires drivers that are provided for MS Windows only. So I can try to use something like NDISwrapper, or buy another USB adapter that works with Linux/Ubuntu.\nHere is information on buying a computer with a network card that supports Linux: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/WifiDocs/WirelessCardsSupported\nHere is a discussion / info-about-how-to install Windows drivers for Netgear's N300 Wireless Mini USB Adapter on Ubuntu:  http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=1830237\nHowever following all these instructions seems to take a few days (??) and requires access to a Windows computer and finding some drivers in C:\\Windows\\system32??\\...somewhere...\\..., or requires downloading Windows driver files via old broken links.\nI suppose I'll buy a USB network adapter that's compatible with Ubuntu. Here is a link to blog posts about some drivers that might work:\nhttps://www.google.se/search?q=best+usb+wireless+adapter+for+ubuntu+12.04\nUpdate 2013-09-30: I bought a wireless bridge ~= wireless access point ~= receiver, and connected it wirelessly to the router. Then I connected another router that I have to this wireless bridge, so now I have my own private network and everything works fine :-)\nThe next time I'll never ever buy a wireless adapter that lists \"Windows\" only :-(\n", "Q: Pinnacle firewire card on Ubuntu 12.04 I am running Ubuntu 12.04 and have a Pinnacle video capture card installed.

This is specific to Ubuntu as I have a dual boot with Windows and things work under Windows. What diagnostics can I run?\n\nA: Use plugreport to see a list of connected 1394 devices in linux.  \nI use it with plugctl to set channels to record more than one stream at a time with DVgrab.  Im not sure what to do if it's not listed in the output of plugreport, but if it is, you should be able to tell DVgrab exactly what channel to look for your DV camera on.  Also I would say that for sure until you see it in plugreport's output, it's not going to with with DVgrab.\n\nA: You need to run dvgrab as root, as the firewire devices are not accessible for unprivileged users. This causes a lot of confusion as the device seems to be connected and working fine, except the user can't access the device node. \n", "Q: NetworkManager in disconnected state There seems to be a problem with my network drivers.

What is the command for getting a filename with any character EXCEPT a few?\nSay I do not want the filename to contain the letters q and Q\nls [^qQ] does not work. What would I do?\n\nA: If you want to use globbing (it's not always a good idea), you can use:\n$ ls -d !(*[qQ]*)\n\nor with shopt -s nocaseglob:\n$ shopt -s nocaseglob\n$ ls -d !(*q*)\n\nThe -d option so as to not list the content of the matched directories.\nFor this to work you must have extglob set, it's probably the case by default. If not, shopt -s extglob will do.\nA better approach would be to use find, as you'll be able to -exec some stuff on the matched files if you need (rename, grep, edit, etc...), and you'll have a much better control on what you need to match. An example:\n$ find . -maxdepth 1 \\! -iname '*q*' -type f\n\nThis will find all files (-type f) in current directory (.) not in subdirectories (-maxdepth 1) that don't (\\!) have a q or a Q in their name (-iname '*q*').\nIf you have a huge number of files, find is better and faster than Bash's globbing, and won't overflow the maximal number of arguments.\nHope this helps!\n\nA: If bash extended globbing is enabled, then you can invert matches with !(pattern) e.g. if\n$ touch aQq qwerty uiop asdfg bnmq\n$ \n$ ls\naQq  asdfg  bnmq  qwerty  uiop\n\nthen\n$ ls !(*[qQ]*)\nasdfg  uiop\n\nwhereas\n$ ls *[qQ]*\naQq  bnmq  qwerty\n\nYou can check the current value of the extglob option using shopt -p extglob and set it with shopt -s extglob. Type help shopt at the bash prompt for more info.\n\nA: Why not simply\nls | grep -v [qQ]\n\nIf instead of single characters you want to exclude file names containing certain strings of charaters you could do so with\nls | grep -v \"str1\\|str2\\|...\"\n\ni.e. separating any string with the escaped pipe char | (which acts as an \"OR\" logical operator).

I doubt anyone would realize the answer is below that question.\n\nA: It is not sloppiness or coincidence that there are two different versions of Python on your system. \nA lot of the apps in Ubuntu and Ubuntu based distros work with Python 2.7. And there are also applications that work with Python 3. \nSince Python 3 is not backwards compatible, by symlinking python to python3 you break a lot of dependencies, hence a lot of applications not working.\n\nA: If you want to use python3 instead of python2.7 just when you manually run python applications, just add:\nalias python='python3'\n\nto your ~/.bash_aliases file. (The file may be empty depending on whether you have added any aliases in the past.)\nThe applications other than the ones you manually start will continue using python2.7 or python3 as before.\n", "Q: How do I list word count in multiple files? Say I need to find out how many words are in each file that has the word 'work' in its name.\nI know that to find files with 'work' in the name, it would be ls work.

If you don't use FILE but pipe in the output of ls work it will only count what it will read on stdin.\nYou need to pipe in the text itself:\ncat *work* | wc -w\n\nAlternative you could execute wc with find -exec. But be aware that this could show multiple \"total\" sums as find will call wc multiple times if there are lots of files.\nfind ./ -type f -name \"*work*\" -exec wc -w {} +\n\n\nA: There are some good answers here but for this I like to use:\nls | grep work | xargs wc -w\n\n", "Q: Help needed with Eazycap (somagic) PLEASE!

The packages installed are libecryptfs0 and ecryptfs-utils.  Note that this is NOT the same as a whole-partition or whole-drive encryption, it simply mounts the encrypted data that exists on the unencrypted hard drive (in /home/.ecryptfs/username) to the user's home directory.\nIt would appear based on  what I found in the wiki that the cypher is AES with 16-byte (128-bit) keys.  These keys are generated per-file, and are then themselves encrypted with your own encryption key, which is finally encrypted symmetrically using your passphrase.  eCryptfs is cross-distro, and built into the kernel.  There's some good information about it here, especially in this article.

(That was a joke). I have two desktopss and a 32 gig pendrive with ubuntu 12.04 installed. My old desktop is ancient, I'd planned on giving it away. To make a long story short, I wiped the harddrive of the old pc, and now I want to recover some lost files using Puppy linux and photorec (i think that the name of the software). You need a place to store the recovered files, and the only thing I have available is the pendrive.\nIs it possible to copy all the files (everything not just media) to my new desktop. Afterwards, I would use the pendrive as the storage space for the recovered files. Finally, after transferring the recovered files to a new location, I would transfer the 12.04 files back to the pendrive. \nI know that was confusing and overall, kind of ridiculous. It would be much easier just to buy a new jump drive or external harddrive, but the closest electronic store is 20 minutes away. Also, I don't want to spend money on something I'm not going to use often.\nI know I promised a short story; I apologize.\nThans in advance.\n\nA: How well did you wipe this drive?  If you used anything worth its salt (DBAN, the shred command), you won't be able to get anything useful back.\nIf you actually just deleted the partitions, the good news is it's definitely possible.\nI would suggest using GPart (or its front-end GParted), which are included in the Ubuntu LiveCD, to recover the old partitions entirely.  That way, photorec won't have to snoop through the whole drive - you'll have the whole filesystem back.  In addition to GPart, the guide has a link to another that'd let you use TestDisk or parted to do the same thing.\nYou can also use GParted to reformat your USB (as long as you aren't currently booting from it), or even shrink the existing partition so you can make a new one for file storage.  You may have to make several trips between computers to get all of your data, but once that's done you can reinstall the LiveCD the same way you installed it before, or return it to its former size, if you wish.\n", "Q: How do I add my Samsung laptop's volume keys?

I would install the games on the other drive, as nowadays they use loooots of space.\nGood luck!\n\nA: I think it's better to have the OS on the SSD and the /home partition on the storage drive. In this way the OS will load faster, and all your \"storage files\" like documents, downloaded files etc will be stored on the HDD. I also suggest you to use the SSD for the project files of KDEnlive and (you said light gaming, so I assume you're going to install steam) make a Steam Library on the SSD so these files, kdenlive project and games, will load faster.\nAbout the video card, (ATI/AMD 7870), for the driver you can use either opensource radeon driver (used and installed by default) or fglrx (AMD Catalyst).

Trust me, my old laptop died because of this overheating occurring too many times. so try to find out why it is overheating. Check whether the fans of your system are operating properly. 84 C is a very high temperature for a CPU.\n\nA: Exactly the same thing happened with me on ubuntu 12.04...The solution is nothing but to open your CPU (if possible ;) ) and clean the dust. The fan which sits above your processor is very important so clean it properly and it will solve your problem(just make sure you don't damage your motherboard)..\nNote:To check temperature of your CPU use BIOS(hardware monitor) because if there is some problem with your OS then you will come to know about that from BIOS..\nhope this helps!\n", "Q: Bypass Authenticated HTTP Proxy :Ubuntu Is there any way to bypass authenticated http proxy to something like 127.0.0.1:port, so that we could use it any application, simply by filling out the proxy 127.0.0.1:port (which could be used for applications that don't have options of filling proxy_username and proxy_passsword).\nI have tried privoxy, but I could make it work only with tor proxy.

Please follow the instructions on the project page to do so.\npychrom is a python application and can be executed without having to be compiled first.

Just installed Ubuntu 12.04 and I installed some updates so I can use aircrack-ng. When I write mixa@mixa-Lenovo-G780:~$ sudo airmon-ng start eth1, I get:\nFound 4 processes that could cause trouble.\nIf airodump-ng, aireplay-ng or airtun-ng stops working after\na short period of time, you may want to kill (some of) them!\n\nPID Name\n890 avahi-daemon\n891 avahi-daemon\n897 NetworkManager\n911 dhclient\n\n\nInterface   Chipset     Driver\n\n\nmixa@mixa-Lenovo-G780:~$\n\nAnd on other Linux (Kali Linux), I had same problem. I had nothing under interface, chipset, and driver.\nHow to fix it?\n\nA: airmon-ng is used to put wireless interfaces into monitor mode, so that you can capture packets (the equivalent of \"promiscuous mode\" on Ethernet cards).\nThe command that you are trying airmon-ng start eth1 is trying to turn on monitor mode for eth1, which is an Ethernet interface, not your wireless interface, so it will not work. You need to use airmon-ng for your wireless interface. Your wireless interface is usually wlan0.\nTo find out the exact name of your wireless interface, you can execute the command iwconfig, which should show you something like this:\nalaa@aa-lu:~$ iwconfig\n\nwlan0     IEEE 802.11bgn  ESSID:\"Alaa\"  \n          Mode:Managed  Frequency:2.472 GHz  Access Point: xx:xx:xx:xx:xx:xx   \n          Bit Rate=72.2 Mb/s   Tx-Power=20 dBm   \n          Retry  long limit:7   RTS thr=2347 B   Fragment thr:off\n          Power Management:off\n          Link Quality=58/70  Signal level=-52 dBm  \n          Rx invalid nwid:0  Rx invalid crypt:0  Rx invalid frag:0\n          Tx excessive retries:0  Invalid misc:514   Missed beacon:0\n\nvmnet8    no wireless extensions.\n\nlo        no wireless extensions.\n\neth0      no wireless extensions.\n\nvmnet1    no wireless extensions.\n\nFrom the output, you can see that wlan0 is a wireless interface.\nSo, the command to turn on monitor mode for wlan0 is sudo airmon-ng start wlan0.\nIf however, you don't have a wireless interface (which is probably the case, looking at your output), then I need to ask the question of why do you want to run airmon-ng when you don't have a wireless card?\nIf you're installing this Ubuntu (or Kali) as a virtual machine, then aircrack-ng will never work, because a virtual machine will always see an Ethernet card, not the wireless card. The only way you can make a virtual machine see a wireless card is by using a wireless USB adapter, such as this one:\n\n\nA: First of all, you need to have an wireless interface like wlan0 to use airmon-ng and as I can see from your output, you don't have it. I deduced this because the output for these fields Interface   Chipset     Driver is empty.\n\nA: airodump-ng mon0 doesnt even worked for me too!\nTry inserting the previous command as \"arimon-ng start wlp3so\" instead of \"airmon-ng start wlan0\"\nbecause wlan0 works for lan network while wlp3s0 works for wireless network\nthen run command \"airodump-ng mon0\". it will surely work for u too\n", "Q: Power-Consumption, switching off Graphiccard?

I'm not sure if you can get a better command line interpreter, but a GUI like RStudio (not in repositories, download deb package from their site) provides better interactivity.\n\nA: A quick way would be to add the following lines to a script called .pythonstartup.py and put it in your home directory:\nimport rlcompleter, readline\nreadline.parse_and_bind('tab:complete')\n\nThen add the following line to your .bashrc:\nexport PYTHONSTARTUP=\"/home/YOUR_USERNAME/.pythonstartup.py\"\n\n\n\n*\n\n*Note 1: The .bashrc file is usually located in your home directory (~).\n\n*Note 2: Replace YOUR_USERNAME with your actual username.\n\n\nThen, all you have to do is source it so the changes take effect right away:\nsource ~/.bashrc\n\nOr just open a new terminal.\n", "Q: bulk/batch convert mp4 and m4v files to webm via command line? is it possible to convert mp4 and m4v to webm via command line?\nI'd like to just in a bulk swoop convert my mp4 and m4v files to web so i can play them in firefox without any issues.\n\nA: Yes, with ffmpeg and bash this is not only possible, but very easy.\nHere is the command for variable bit-rate conversion for .mp4 -> .webm: \nffmpeg -i input.mp4 -c:v libvpx -b:v 1M -c:a libvorbis output.webm\n\nYou can then use the command in a bash script to batch covert your files.

I won't guarantee everything will work since I don't have ffmpeg installed on this machine to test it, so you may need to modify the script and/or the conversion settings to suit your needs.\nDocumentation for the webm encoder can be found here: http://trac.ffmpeg.org/wiki/vpxEncodingGuide\n", "Q: Wireless disabled by hardware switch on an Asus X550V I'm using Ubuntu 13.04 and I have ASUS X550V laptop.

Some people suggested using dconf tool or Gnome tweak or Unity tweak tool.\nPoint is I want to do it manually so that I know how things work behind the screen.\nOS: Ubuntu 13.04\n\nA: Alternative to Unity Tweak Tool, you can use Dconf Editor which is pre-installed in 13.04.\nAfter you open Dconf Editor, go to org > gnome > desktop > interface. Here you can see font-name, monospace-font-name, document-font-name, text-scaling-factor, etc.\nTo change titlebar font, you should go to org > gnome > desktop > wm > preferences where you can find titlebar-font.\nYou can also search for font and see all settings about fonts.\n\n\nA: To change the fonts, you can use the Gnome tweak tool.  To install it, just press Ctrl+Alt+T on your keyboard to open Terminal.

How do I recover the data?\nThe data is there, how do I see it?\n\nA: Windows 8 has a feature called fast startup, where it actually does not shut down, but hibernates instead.  If you hibernate one OS then try to access the same filesystem from another, it will be corrupted.  You will need to run scandisk to repair the damage, and in the future, either disable the fast startup feature, or make sure you always reboot into Ubuntu instead of shutdown, then turn the power on and boot into Ubuntu ( while Windows is now really hibernated ).\n", "Q: How do I pin the lowlatency kernels so apt doesn't update with a newer generic kernel? I'm on Kubuntu 12.04 with lts-raring HWE stack. I'm running kernel 3.8.0.30.18 low latency. A recent update replaced my low latency kernel with a slightly newer (3.8.0.31) generic kernel.

You might also have to separately remove the actual kernel image, as well as this meta-package. Just make sure you have a usable kernel image installed before removing some of them. Then apt will simply not update that which is not installed.\nThe -generic kernels do not supersede the -lowlatency kernels. However, the last kernel that was installed, becomes the default. You will still have the -lowlatency kernel installed, and you can still choose it within the grub boot menu, or even change it to be the default again.\n\nA: You might also want to get Grub customizer by Daniel Richter.\nIt is a very handy little program that lets you specify what kernel\nyou want to boot by default.\nIt is a graphical interface that lets you configure the grub settings \nand entries.\nYou can get it easily \nOpen the terminal and run the following commands\nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:danielrichter2007/grub-customizer\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get install grub-customizer\n\nI think you will like this a lot\n", "Q: Problems with the memory in a booted USB I have got a USB bootable for Ubuntu.

Problems exist on UEFI machines (see bug 1159016) which require some manual fixes.\n\nA: On a live USB, things do not save - simple as that.

I have gone into usr/share/icons/gnome/32x32 where notify-send pulls from, but it won't show any image at all. Is it possible to include an image other than the stock images?\n\nA: You need to tell it where to find the icon, like\nnotify-send -i /usr/share/icons/gnome/32x32/status/stock_lock-broken.png  summary test\n\nAnd of course you can use your own icon too, not only the default ones.\nFor using an icon from your own home directory you would use one of\nnotify-send -i ~/pictures/picture-name.png summary test\nnotify-send -i /home/<yourusername>/pictures/picture-name.png summary test\n\nRemember: names are case sensitive and paths must be absolute paths. /Home probably doesn't exist on your system.\nman notify-send will tell you about other options too.\n", "Q: Issues downloading and installing ubuntu iso alongside win7 When downloading the iso it downloads normally for awhile displaying that i have a few hours to wait and then randomly jumps to complete.

You can get Unetbootin\nfrom the software manager\nOh, if you are running a slow computer then try to just let the iso download,\ndon't open other pages, etc while it is downloading!\nHope this helps you\n\nA: To check if your Download was complete and no errors occurred, you can compare the MD5 checksum of the downloaded file with the checksum computed for the file on the server, as displayed in the official checksum list. If the MD5sum is different, something went wrong with your download and you should redownload the ISO.\nIf for some reason your downloads keep failing and you think it's the servers fault or a bad undersea cable, you can instead use a different mirror (see the list of CD-image mirrors).\nIf the download keeps failing and you suspect that your own internet connection is not stable, (and you don't mind giving some bandwidth for upload,) you can use bittorrent downloads.

Immediately dropped Windows 8 for ArtistX. Apparently corrupted .iso, so I reinstalled with a new .iso (after they upgraded their build to 13.04, apparently) then just decided the whole thing was just too bloated so decided the smartest thing for someone that hasn't ever touched a terminal to do is go to the last LTS, 12.04. Throughout all of my ridiculous floundering there has been one constant since dropping Windows; no wireless support.\nI am currently on the machine in question hooked directly to my router. No problems there. I've tried going on the Toshiba support website and downloading the drivers but there's no indication I'm not doing it wrong.\nI've done some looking around online and learned to type lshw and, concerning the network, I get this:\n*-network UNCLAIMED\n              description: Network controller\n               product: RTL8188EE Wireless Network Adapter\n               vendor: Realtek Semiconductor Co., Ltd.\n               physical id: 0\n               bus info: pci@0000:05:00.0\n               version: 01\n               width: 64 bits\n               clock: 33MHz\n               capabilities: bus_master cap_list\n               configuration: latency=0\n               resources: ioport:2000(size=256) memory:f0100000-f0103fff\n\nand also, and it may be an unrelated issue, I have a serial saying it's unclaimed as well. It's a Hynex Semi-Conductor, apparently. I don't know what that is.\nI'm seeing a lot of posts about the RTL8188 but they seem to be in Greek (or Unix, very little difference to me) so if someone could ELI5 (or like I'm a 30 year old man that has only just now walked away from Windows, anyway) I would appreciate it greatly. Kinda dove in head first and landed immediately over my head I guess.\n\nA: Here is the link or follow the link above (Chili555) Followed the directions it works good it says for a Toshiba C55 A5281 and Ubuntu 13.04, I have a Toshiba Satellite L75D-A7280, Ubuntu 12.04LTS all updates and 3.11.4 kernel,  Wireless not working on Toshiba Satellite C55-A5281\n\nA: You should give this driver a try:  https://github.com/FreedomBen/rtl8188ce-linux-driver\nAfter having many issues with my RTL8188CE I finally downloaded the driver source code and fixed it myself.  It has been working beautifully for me ever since.  Make sure you download the one for your OS version.  For example, if you're on 12.04 then switch to the ubuntu-12.04 branch.

For instance,I am renaming comics, and so I have a directory that looks like this:\n$ls *.cbr\nInjustice - Gods Among Us 001 (2013) (Digital) (K6 of Ultron-Empire).cbr\nInjustice - Gods Among Us 002 (2013) (Digital) (K6 of Ultron-Empire).cbr \nInjustice - Gods Among Us 003 (2013) (Digital) (K6 of Ultron-Empire).cbr\n\nMy goal is to use rename the files so they look like the following:\nInjustice - Gods Among Us 001.cbr\nInjustice - Gods Among Us 002.cbr\nInjustice - Gods Among Us 003.cbr\n\nSo I tried the following:\nrename -n 's/^\\d{3}.\\.cbr/^\\ $1.cbr/' *.cbr\n\nWas assuming that by delimiting to the first set up on the 3 digit issue, I could then change to rename everything starting from the beginning line (Injustice - God Among Us) and add in the 3 digit issue number (\\d{3}) everything would pan out. Needless to say, it didn't. \nAlthough I would like a little direction on how to get this solved, I really want to better understand how to leverage using pregex for future use.\n\nA: I think you're misunderstanding the meaning of the carat (^) line anchor - it does not mean 'look for a pattern starting with the following regex', it means 'look for a line starting with the following pattern' - which will of course not match any of your listed filenames, because the 001 ... 003 comes part way through the name.\nWhat you are probably thinking of are Perl's lookaround constructs - for example, to limit your match to the portion of the name after the first 3-digit sequence, you can use a (?<=\\d{3}) lookbehind. Similarly, to limit the match to the portion before the .cbr suffix you could use the lookaheaad (?=\\.cbr). Finally you could match any characters between the lookbehind and the lookahead i.e. .*, and replace them with nothing:\n$ rename -nv 's/(?<=\\d{3}).*(?=.cbr)//' *.cbr\nInjustice - Gods Among Us 001 (2013) (Digital) (K6 of Ultron-Empire).cbr renamed as Injustice - Gods Among Us 001.cbr\nInjustice - Gods Among Us 002 (2013) (Digital) (K6 of Ultron-Empire).cbr renamed as Injustice - Gods Among Us 002.cbr\nInjustice - Gods Among Us 003 (2013) (Digital) (K6 of Ultron-Empire).cbr renamed as Injustice - Gods Among Us 003.cbr\nNote that there are usually several different ways to match and rename a particular set of files - I'm not sure this is the most efficient or robust however I hope it illustrates what I think you were shooting for.\n\nA: I'm assuming that the (2013) (Digital) (K6 of Ultron-Empire) string is fixed in all files, you don't need anything too complex actually:\n$ ls \nInjustice - Gods Among Us 001 (2013) (Digital) (K6 of Ultron-Empire).cbr\nInjustice - Gods Among Us 002 (2013) (Digital) (K6 of Ultron-Empire).cbr\nInjustice - Gods Among Us 003 (2013) (Digital) (K6 of Ultron-Empire).cbr\n$ rename 's/ \\(2013\\) \\(Digital\\) \\(K6 of Ultron\\-Empire\\)//g' *\n$ ls\nInjustice - Gods Among Us 001.cbr  Injustice - Gods Among Us 003.cbr\nInjustice - Gods Among Us 002.cbr\n\nI gave away flexibility for practicality. If you want to remove everything between (...) you can use even more clever methods:\nrename -n 's/ ([(].*Digital.*[)])//g' *\n\nAlso, your regex is not selecting anything actually.

I've tried to load several versions of Linux and the problem I run into is the touchpad is not recognized. The touchscreen works but the touchpad isn't loaded when I go into control panel. I posted on a different forum and was told I should do a insmod psmouse but that did't work. \nAny idea how I can load drivers for my touchpad?\n\nA: This appears to be a BIOS issue.  Other users have reported that versions prior to 1.53 seem unaffected by this issue, however if you simply use the touchscreen to initiate a restart, the touchpad will be recognized the second time.  No one seems to have yet reported a good explanation for this.\nBe careful flashing to earlier BIOS versions as it seems some critical fixes are also in place post-1.53.  In my case, the 1.53 had a serious problem with my internal network adapter, and the Twist would not boot without first manually disconnecting it.\n", "Q: Installing a local package to replace an already installed one I'm trying to install a locally built .deb file that will replace an installed package.\nAttempting to use dpkg -i results in this:\ndabo@chrubuntu:~/Downloads/mali$ sudo dpkg -i chromium-mali-opengles_0.45-0ubuntu1_armhf.deb \ndpkg: considering removing libegl1-mesa:armhf in favour of chromium-mali-opengles:armhf ...\ndpkg: no, cannot proceed with removal of libegl1-mesa:armhf (--auto-deconfigure will help):\n libegl1-mesa-drivers:armhf depends on libegl1-mesa (= 9.1.4-0ubuntu0.1)\n  libegl1-mesa:armhf is to be removed.\n\ndpkg: regarding chromium-mali-opengles_0.45-0ubuntu1_armhf.deb containing chromium-mali-opengles:armhf:\n chromium-mali-opengles conflicts with libegl1-x11\n  libegl1-mesa:armhf provides libegl1-x11 and is present and installed.\n\ndpkg: error processing chromium-mali-opengles_0.45-0ubuntu1_armhf.deb (--install):\n conflicting packages - not installing chromium-mali-opengles:armhf\nErrors were encountered while processing:\n chromium-mali-opengles_0.45-0ubuntu1_armhf.deb\n\nWhen I try to uninstall libegl1-mesa, it uninstalls a ton of other packages that depend on it as well.\nIs there a way I can install chromium-mali-opengles_0.45-0ubuntu1_armf.deb?\nThe one thing I'd think of doing is using dpkg --get-selections to save all the package names, uninstalling libegl1-mesa and all of its dependencies, installing chromium-mali-opengles, and then restoring the rest of the packages with dpkg --set-selections.

You will get a dialog box with all your partitions mentioned and at the bottom, you will be asked where you want to store your grub. Here, you should point it to /dev/sda. Note that there is no number at the end and just the device name.\n\nA: if your hdd is gpt (not ntfs), Ubuntu should put grub in a \"bios grub\" partition. Shouldn't need a GB, 2MB is plenty for multiple OS's in Grub\n\nA: This is a matter of planning and preferences. In your case since you will have several OS's installed you should use a single partition for the /boot separated of everything else. The size should be about 1GB for the amount of OS's you will be installing.\nYou didn't put more information into your question but, if you are not using Windows 8 with UEFI and/or plan to deactivate UEFI, I don't see problems when you install Ubuntu. BTW, the order of installation should be:\n\n\n*\n\n*Windows 8 (remembering to leave space for other OS's)\n\n*Other OS\n\n*Ubuntu, here you select were to install the boot partition. The reason is that GRUB seems to do not like several kernels into the /boot (I had to experience that myself) so it's better to leave the /boot partition till the end.\n\n", "Q: Can't boot windows or ubuntu!

A better option would be to simply format your second hard drive using GParted. You probably want to use ext3 or ext4 if the hard drive will be Linux-only. After formatting it, simply move some lesser-used and larger files over to the second drive to make space on the first.\n", "Q: How to start an application with bottom most property? I want to start an application with bottom-most property. That means that the window will remain always in the bottom of the other windows.\nIs this possible? I think that there must be an application that does such a thing, but I have not idea how to find it...\nFor example, I want to start chromium-browser with bottom most property. How can I do that?\n\nA: You could use Devilspie2 (http://www.gusnan.se/devilspie2/), a program which performs actions on windows as they are created, using scripts written in Lua (http://www.lua.org/manual/)\nInstall it with: sudo apt-get install devilspie2, then run devilspie2.  You should see the error message:\nNo script files found in the script folder - exiting.\n\nIt will have created this folder as ~/.config/devilspie2/.  Create the following file, and save it in this directory with the extension .lua, e.g. as chromium.lua:\ndebug_print(\"Window Name: \" .. get_window_name())\ndebug_print(\"Application name: \" .. get_application_name())\ndebug_print(\"WM_CLASS: \" .. get_class_instance_name())\ndebug_print(\"Window Class: \" .. get_window_class())\nif (string.match(get_application_name(),\"Chromium$\")) then\n   set_window_below();\nend\n\nThen run devilspie2 --debug & and open Chromium.  The terminal should show:\nWindow Name: Untitled - Chromium\nApplication name: Untitled - Chromium\n\nAll Chromium windows (any application name ending in 'Chromium') opened while Devilspie2 is running will now be set to be below all normal windows.\nOpening other programs while Devilspie2 is running with the debug switch, should help you modify this code for other applications.\nTo automatically run Devilspie2\nCreate a file ~/.config/autostart/devilspie2.desktop, containing:\n[Desktop Entry]\nType=Application\nName=Devilspie2\nExec=devilspie2\nNoDisplay=true\nTerminal=false\n\nAdding Additional Conditions\nTo run a script for an application only sometimes, you could either:\n\n\n*\n\n*Run Devilspie2 only as needed, e.g. devilspie2 & app ; killall devilspie2, though it will apply its rules to all new windows created while it is running.\n\n*For GTK apps, the option --name= changes the application name, and --class= the Window class.  Chromium doesn't recognise this despite documentation.\n\n*Run the command with a modified environment, e.g. window-below= chromium-browser, and instead use the following rule:\nif (string.match(get_application_name(),\"Chromium$\")) and\n   (string.match(io.input(\"/proc/\" .. get_window_property(\"_NET_WM_PID\") .. \"/environ\"):read(\"*a\"), \"window-below=\"))\nthen\n   set_window_below();\nend\n\n", "Q: ClamAV continues to say that my definitions are outdated I have just updated the definitions for clamav and here is the output:\nClamAV update process started at Mon Sep 30 09:22:24 2013\nWARNING: Your ClamAV installation is OUTDATED!\nWARNING: Local version: 0.97.8 Recommended version: 0.98\nDON'T PANIC!

I have a lot of images which have white borders around them. I would like to crop those borders all at once, preferably from command line. I believe that it can be done with ImageMagick, but I couldn't find suitable command.\nI know that it can be done with Windows program named Irfanview with \"Auto crop borders\" option, but I am looking for Ubuntu-based and preferably command line based solution.\n\nA: ImageMagick Trim\nThe command line option trim used together with convert, or mogrify lets you trim borders of the same color as the corners of an image.\nUsage:\nconvert input.png -trim output.png\n\nThe additional option -fuzz (which takes a percentage as an argument, e.g. -fuzz 10%) also removes colors near the corner colors.\nNote: The -fuzz option must precede -trim because options' order matters for convert command to work as expected.\nUse the option +repage to remove a canvas (if applicable).\nImageMagick Batch Trim (find)\nAbove command for ImageMagick Trim can also be used to batch process images combined with the find command:\nfind ./ -name \"pattern\" -exec convert {} -trim outputfolder/{} \\;\n\nThe above command will trim all images that fit the pattern part of the command and save them in a new folder named outputfolder.\nAssuming that images are PNGs, then command will look like this:\nfind ./ -name \"*.png\" -exec convert {} -trim outputfolder/{} \\;\n\nImageMagick Batch Trim (mogrify)\nWhile find allows for much greater control where output files will be placed, it is also possible to do the same with ImageMagick's mogrify:\nmogrify -trim *.png\n\nAnd if you want to crop colors near the corner colors (adjust the percentage based on the results you are observing):\nmogrify -trim -fuzz 10% *.png\n\nPlease note that unlike convert and batch operation with find and convert, mogrify overwrites all files. To keep the originals use the -path option or do a backup copy of all images in the directory before proceeding with the mogrify command.\nSide note: mogrify can be used to execute most (if not all) convert operations in batch, while overwriting original files.\nAs Trevor noted in the comments, you can use the -path option to output converted files to a new directory without overwriting the original files:\nmogrify -trim -path trimmed_folder/ *.png\n\nIrfanView\nIrfanView runs quite nicely with Wine.

How can I fix it? The lid switch of the notebook Lenovo Thinkpad X230i had worked just fine: closing the lid led to a suspend as expected. After an update of the system on the 18th of September the lid switch seems to be not recognized any more.\nIf I manually click on \"Suspend\", it works fine, so suspending is not the core of the problem.\nI tried to read the \"Lid\" state, by entering while [ 1 ]; do cat /proc/acpi/button/lid/LID/state; sleep 1; done in the terminal and also by trying watch -n 4 'upower -d | grep lid-', but the reported lid state is always \"OPEN\". My strong assumption is that the lid switch did not physically break at the same time when I did the update. Also, the notebook is just three weeks old.\nIs there a way that I can fix the correct reading of the lid state in Ubuntu? Thanks a lot for your help!\n\nA: It seems that the problem comes from the lack of systemd according to this article. \nFrom the same webpage, there is a workaround: put the following into /etc/acpi/local/lid.sh.post, and make it executable.\n#!/bin/bash\n\ngrep -q closed /proc/acpi/button/lid/*/state\nif [ $? = 0 ]; then\n   pm-suspend\nfi\n\n\nA: Thanks for the help. I figured out that it actually is a hardware problem with the lid switch. Just closing the lid does not lead to recognition of the closure by the switch. I need to press with a finger at a particular point on the lid. This is a hardware and not software problem. Thanks!\n", "Q: What application for illustrated story telling?

For installing them you should:\n\n\n*\n\n*Find Menu -> Devices -> Install Guest Additions.\n\n*Run sudo /cdrom/VBoxLinuxAdditions.run inside your guest system.\n\n\nThen run sudo mount -t vboxsf -o uid=$UID,gid=$GID share ~/host inside guest. Share is the name of the share.\nSource.\nSuggested way\nBut, if you still want to use Samba, then you should do this:\n\n\n*\n\n*Install samba and system-config-samba on host machine and configure your share. Be sure that you enable access to that share to some local user.\nExample share (inside /etc/samba/smb.conf):\n[exch]\n    comment = Exchange\n    path = /home/karimov-danil/Public/exch\n    writeable = yes\n;   browseable = yes\n    valid users = karimov-danil, nobody\n\n\n*Install cifs-utils onto your guest machine.

Then I put the executable(a.out) on Ubuntu 12.10(64 bit) VMWare virtual machine and tried to execute it(./a.out). The OS does not identify the file and says 'No such file or directory'. But when I put the same executable on a Ubuntu 12.10(64 bit) running on a 64 bit laptop, it runs fine and I get the desired output.\nThe VM is running on IBM Blade Servers. I wanted to know why the results for a VM? \n\nA: The message No such file or directory does not refer to your executable file: a.out. Instead it refers to a helper program that’s needed to run the 32 bit dynamically linked executable a.out.\nNow, I found all of these very well explained in this nice article:\n\n\n*\n\n*About running 32 bit programs on 64 bit Ubuntu and shared libraries\n\nStatic and dynamic linkage\nThere are two types of binary executables: statically linked and\n  dynamically linked ones. First about the statically linked ones: When\n  a program wants to call a library function, it refers to it by name.\n  When building the program from source, all library functions used in\n  the program are copied from the library into the program. The program\n  then contains its own code as well as the code of the library\n  functions it uses. Then in the calling places the name is changed to\n  the address of the corresponding function in the program. This process\n  is called linking because it links together the name of a function\n  with the function itself, its implementation. It’s called static,\n  because the link cannot be changed after the program has been built.\nDynamically linked programs work differently: The program also refers\n  to library functions by name. When building the program, two lists are\n  assembled and stored together with the program: a list of which\n  library functions are used in which places, and a list of the\n  libraries that contain the functions used by the program. That’s all\n  for building the program.\nLater, at execution time, a special helper program, the so-called\n  dynamic linker, looks in specific places in the file system for each\n  library on the library list and loads it into memory. Now the dynamic\n  linker knows at what memory addresses the library functions are\n  available. It uses the first list to write the correct address in all\n  places that call library functions. Then the dynamically linked\n  program can be run.\n\n", "Q: visudo crashing on making changes I am attempting to add an entry to visudo:\nadmin ALL=(ALL) /bin/kill\n\nI have attempted to make changes to this in the past but crashed the visudo file.

I made a single partition using GUID instead of MBR. My GUI version of Dist Utility that came with my version of Linux Ubuntu 12.04LTS) is reporting the partition misalignment by 3072 bytes.\nMy reading on the forums seems to indicate that if I used GUID partitioning, I don't need to worry about the partition misalignment, that it's irrelevant. Obviously, I don't know much about what I'm doing with disk partitioning and formatting, and I don't know much more about Linux, other than it's been an exceptional OS for my needs.\nAnyway, I am hoping that someone with more knowledge and experience can comment and tell me if the above assumption is correct, or if I need to go back and re-align the partition.\n\nA: You should identify the sector-precise start point of the partition. You can do this in GParted by selecting your disk's one partition, right-clicking, and selecting \"Information\" from the pop-up menu. This produces a dialog box like the following:\n\nThe \"First sector\" line tells you what the first sector is.\nAlternatively, typing sudo parted /dev/sda unit s print or sudo gdisk -l /dev/sda should produce the same information. (gdisk isn't installed by default, though; you'll need to install it first via sudo apt-get install gdisk).\nIn any of these cases, if the first sector value is divisible by 8, you're safe. If not, the partition is misaligned and you should back it up, delete it, re-create it, and restore the data. Doing a move/resize operation on the start of the disk should also correct the problem; but be aware that this is risky, so backing up is advisable in this case.\nNote that the partition shown in my screen shot is not properly aligned. This is OK in my case because the disk is not an Advanced Format model. Proper alignment is required only for Advanced Format disks, SSDs, and some types of RAID arrays; but precisely what type of alignment is necessary depends on the disk type. The vast majority of modern spinning disks use Advanced Format, so it's best to assume you need to align on 8-sector boundaries with any modern hard disk.\nFor more on this topic, see this article, which I wrote some time ago. Modern software is a bit better at this than it was in 2010, but you can still wind up with improper alignment if you use old software, if you use unusual software, or if you mis-use advanced partitioning options that override alignment defaults. Alignment issues are mostly the same for MBR as for GPT disks.\n", "Q: how to (if possible) create a SSL certificate for only one website on my apache2 server? I saw some similar posts like this , but it didn't help me at my exact problem.\nSo I am using ubuntu 12.04 on a server with apache2 on it. There are like 5 websites which are Virtualhosts and Namebased running on it (using the same port). Now I need another page whiche REQUIRES a SSL certificate. \nIs it possible to run just the one page under ssl or do I automatically load everything in it when I configure SSL ?\nI know that I have to put the SSL server under Port 443 like this :\n<virtualhost *:443>\n        SSLEngine On\n        SSLCertificateFile /path/to/your/sslcert\n        DocumentRoot /path/your/webcontent\n</virtualhost>\n\nDoes anyone know and want to explain me, how to setup ssl for just one page?\n\nA: When you install Apache it creates a template for a default virtual host, but it also has a default-ssl virtual host. Copy that file and rename it my_secure_site or whatever. Then just change the domain name, the document root, directory, and the ssl key and certificate to the proper values for you site.\nAlso be sure you have the ssl module enable in Apache a2enmod mod-ssl. ports.conf should have a statement that will make Apache listen on 443 if a virtual domain is using ssl, but if you have a problem check you are listening on 443. \nI had an issue where all my hosts were defined <virtualhost 123.123.123.132> and the when I tried to define the ssl site as <virtualhost 123.123.123.132:443>. I got an error like the following.\n[Wed Oct 21 16:37:26 2009] [error] VirtualHost *:80 -- mixing * ports and non-* ports with a NameVirtualHost address is not supported, proceeding with undefined results\nTo avoid this all your virtual hosts should explicitly define the port <virtualhost 123.123.112.132:80>\n\nA: solved.\nfirst of all check your hostname by entering \nhostname  (you will need it later)\n\nenable ssl-mod \nsudo a2enmod ssl\n\nguide from scratch :\nCreate folder for ssl certificate and key\nsudo mkdir /etc/apache2/ssl \n\ncreate .key file and .crt file and after that load both apache2...\nsudo openssl req -x509 -nodes -days 365 -newkey rsa:2048 -keyout /etc/apache2/ssl/apache.key -out /etc/apache2/ssl/apache.crt\n\nwhen you enter all the details for the certificate make sure that you have the same common name as your hostname , otherwise you will get a warning in your apache2 log for not having the right hostname. (not neccessary, but better to avoid this)\nyour ssl will only run under port 443 so you need to put the listener 443 to ports.conf in your apache dir by adding Listen 443\nthan create your ssl page under sites-available\nsudo nano /etc/apache2/sites-available/ssl\n<virtualhost *:443>\n        SSLEngine On\n        SSLCertificateFile /etc/apache2/ssl/apache.crt\n        SSLCertificateKeyFile /etc/apache2/ssl/apache.key\n        DocumentRoot /var/www/yourlink\n</virtualhost>\n\nload the page by sudo a2ensite ssl\nsudo service apache2 reload\n\nnow it will only SSL secure my yourlink folder.\n", "Q: Cannot find Windows 8 option in GRUB menu after installing 13.04 I've installed Ubuntu 13.04 in a separate partition of my hard drive which also has Windows 8 in another partition.  The problem is, GRUB menu is not showing windows 8 OS to boot into.\nSo if I want to boot into Windows then I must go into boot priority and change boot order.\nWhat should I do to get windows 8 option in GRUB menu?\nAlso I cannot access other partitions of the hard drive where Windows is installed, similarly cannot access Ubuntu partition when using windows.\n(I found similar question in this section but did not understand it as I'm new to this platform.)\n\nA: You will need to manually put the entry back into your grub file.  Edit /boot/grub/grub.cfg\nIn fact, Ubuntu has a nasty habit of changing your grub.cfg even for a minor header update to your existing kernel.  Though minor updates do not cause you to lose boot partition info (as apparently happened with your update to 13.X), the updates still change your default boot kernel, without asking or presenting an option to keep the grub.cfg the way it is/was.\nFor instance, I have a custom network driver, and I always end up with a networkless PC if I take the default grub config after a kernel header update.  \nThus, be sure to SAVE your grub.cfg somewhere outside of the /boot partition. If you accept the kernel header updates, you can restore your grub.cfg to as it was before the updates, if you saved a copy of it somewhere beforehand.\n", "Q: Extracting specific data in a file using regex Following info i want to extract from a file which has different version,release date,CVE number.

I am trying to install Ubuntu 12.04.3 LTS (32 bit server) on an embedded computer that uses the Intel N2800 CPU and chipset.  I know there is no video driver for this chipset, but I don't care because all I want is a text console (no X Windows).\nThe Ubuntu installation works and the resulting system can be booted.  The problem is I have NO video at all when it boots (after installation is complete).  I do see the GRUB boot menu during boot, but then as the Linux kernel boots the video goes black.  There is no X windows or graphics-- I just want a plain old 640x480 text console with 24 lines x 80 columns.\nI tried installing Ubuntu 12.04 with the \"nomodeset\" option (press F6 before installing Ubuntu and ticking the \"nomodeset\" install option).  This did not help-- same behavior.\nI think the problem may be that GRUB is going into a high-res mode (which works surprisingly) and then the kernel tries to control the graphics mode during boot, but it fails and the video goes black (no video signal).\nI know the system boots successfully because I can plug in a USB keyboard and login and reboot the system (I can't see what I'm typing, but the system does reboot when I issue the command).\nAny help is appreciated.  Thanks in advance.\n\nA: So, you didn't say whether you were attaching the monitor to a serial, USB, or VGA port.  And, it matters.  The problem sounds more like the 'console' is not going to the port the monitor is attached to.  \nIf you think the monitor is attached to the correct port, try editing /etc/default/grub and uncomment the 'GRUB_GFXMODE=640x480' line and/or put in whatever resolution you want to run at.\nIf it is not the correct port, edit /boot/grub/grub.cfg and find the line that says (approximately) console=ttyS0  and replace with the device path to your console.  If you do change this, you will need the link below to make sure you are running getty or mingetty on that port: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/SerialConsoleHowto\nThe N2800 has the \"FDI\" integrated graphics chip set built-in.  Unless your monitor is pre-1987, it can do graphics, as well.  \nYou also say 'there is no X windows or Graphics' - but, your hardware supports both X and graphics.  Thus, we need to ask, did you or did you not install Unity desktop and/or an X server, with or without a desktop?  Ubuntu generically tries to use X it can find if it.\n", "Q: How to create a service on Ubuntu Upstart I have a Java executable program that I can run by typing java -jar abc.jar in terminal.\nHow can I run it as a service? I want to run it as a service like by typing service abc start.\n\nA: Make sure you're on 14.04. Ubuntu 16.04 (and above) uses systemd, not Upstart.\nA Upstart script is a script file placed at /etc/init/ and ending in .conf.\nIt requires 2 sections: one to indicate when to start, and another with the command to execute.\nThe easiest script to start with your sample is:\n# myprogram.conf\nstart on filesystem\nexec /usr/bin/java -jar /path_to/program\n\nCreated as root under /etc/init/myprogram.conf.\nIf your script requires more than one command line, use the script section instead of the exec line:\n# myprogram.conf\nstart on filesystem\nscript\n    /usr/bin/java -jar /path_to/program\n    echo \"Another command\"\nend script\n\nTo enable bash completion for your service, add a symlink into /etc/init.d folder:\nsudo ln -s /etc/init/myprogram.conf /etc/init.d/myprogram\n\nThen try start and stop it:\nsudo service myprogram start\n\nAccording the upstart cookbook, you can create pre-start/post-start and pre-stop/post-stop commands to be executed.\nAdditionally, I read you want to check if a process is running. Check this question and maybe use the pre-start section.\n\nA: You need to create an upstart.  http://upstart.ubuntu.com/getting-started.html\nUpstart is (IMHO) a disaster compared to good ol' SysV init scripts. Upstart is FAR more effort with little upside to the added work.  With that said, I suspect there will be a few upstart defenders out there that will take me to task for me stating the obvious ;-)\n", "Q: Unable to change brightness on Sony EH18FA I couldn't change brightness of my Sony EH18FA laptop with Ubuntu 13.04.

Thanks!\n\nA: I had the same problem building GHC-7.8.2 on a Raspberry Pi: the compiler ran out of memory while doing compiler/main/DynFlags.hs.

Its a very good alternative to network manager in Ubuntu and it seems to always work when Network Manager doesn't. To install it just open up the terminal. Now download the latest NetworkManager, in case you need to reinstall it if WICD doesn't work\nsudo apt-get install -d --reinstall network-manager network-manager-gnome \n\nThen to install it\nsudo apt-get install wicd-gtk \n\nAnd now you need to uninstall NetworkManager:\nsudo apt-get remove --purge network-manager-gnome network-manager \n\nNow you can find WICD in your menu Start WICD, find the network you want to use and enter the information needed, password, encryption, etcetera and choose Automatically Connect to this network. You should be good to go!\nWICD may also be available in Ubuntu Update Manager so you can look there first but it is important to uninstall Network Manager completely to prevent conflicts!!\n", "Q: Deleted old version of kernel to free up space - now getting nonstop errors My /boot partition was full, so I deleted an old version of the kernel to free up space, so I deleted the following files in /boot:\nabi-3.8.0-25-generic\nconfig-3.8.0-25-generic\ninitrd.img-3.8.0-25-generic\nSystem.map-3.8.0-25-generic\nvmlinuz-3.8.0-25-generic\n\nBut now, whenever I do anything in apt-get, it throws errors, for example:\nsudo apt-get -f install\nReading package lists...

Now, using gparted I have partitioned an ntfs file system to install Windows 7. But it seems that Windows 7 did not install any of the partition stating the selected partition is of type gpt. Now moreover trying to format, I have formatted my grub bootloader. So I can't boot to Ubuntu either. Now I have a live Ubuntu usb. But before fixing the grub, I would like to know how can I install Windows without deleting my entire Ubuntu and hard-disk? I can't do that. I have formatted the partition to ntfs using gparted. Why does Windows still give me the gpt error? Is there any way to do it? Or someone please tell me to stop trying.\n\nA: Windows installs only to Master Boot Record (MBR) disks on BIOS-based computers and only to GUID Partition Table (GPT) disks on EFI-based computers. Linux, OTOH, is more flexible; it can install to GPT on BIOS-based computers, and in some cases it's possible to install to MBR on EFI-based computers. (The Ubuntu installer disallows the latter, IIRC.)\nIn any event, if your computer has an EFI, you should be able to proceed by forcing the Windows 7 installer to boot in EFI mode. You may be able to do this by selecting a CD/DVD boot device with \"EFI\" or \"UEFI\" in the description in the firmware's boot manager; or you may need to play games with the installation medium to get it to boot in EFI mode. I don't happen to have any URLs handy, but Googling on \"boot Windows 7 installer in EFI mode\" might turn something up.\nIf your computer has a conventional BIOS with no EFI support, your best option is to convert your disk from GPT to MBR format. You can do this with gdisk; see this section of the gdisk documentation for details on how to do this. Note that you may need to resize partitions, and you'll need to ensure that the NTFS partition you created for Windows must be a primary partition once it's converted to MBR form.\nIn either case, you'll need to re-install or re-enable a Linux boot loader after you've installed Windows. The Boot Repair utility can usually do this. In the case of an EFI-mode boot, you could also try a number of alternative EFI boot loaders.\n", "Q: Deja Dup Backup: Limit Drive Space Usage and Force Full Backups Only Good day,\nI have configured Deja Dup to backup my home folder and a couple other locations to a folder on a spare drive of mine, /media/backupDrive/myBackups. I have made some minor changes to GnuPG, as noted in another post (Automated Backups + Encryption) so that it uses AES256 for encryption.\nI have two problems with Deja Dup though:\n\n\n*\n\n*It seems that it performs an initial full backup, and then differential backups afterwards. I don't see any way to control the backup types with finer granularity. Since It's backing up large (50GB+) encrypted binary archives, I don't want it doing differential backups. I just want it to do FULL/COMPLETE backups each time, and never attempt differential or incremental backups. Is this possible?\n\n*It also seems that backups will continue each week until the drive runs out of space, at which point Deja Dup will supposedly delete the oldest backups to make room for new backups. Is there a way to cap how many GB in size the backup folder can be, rather than allowing Deja Dup to fill up the entire drive? I guess I could just re-partition the drive mounted at /media/backupDrive, but I'd like to avoid that at the moment if I can.\n\n\nThank you all in advance.\n\nA: 1) You can do this, but only on Deja Dup 24 or higher.  Which means using Ubuntu 12.10 or higher.  There is no backport to 12.04 LTS right now.\nTo make Deja Dup 24 always do full backups, run the following:\ngsettings set org.gnome.DejaDup full-backup-period 1\n\n2) Nope!  :-/\n", "Q: Install Ubuntu over Windows Vista or reformat the HDD and fresh install? I'm considering changing from Windows Vista; I just need to know a few things first. I have a Toshiba P100 laptop with Vista preloaded. Unfortunately, it has become corrupted and no longer works. I am missing approximately 30GB of disk-space and now my machine is operating on somewhere between 64-69GB.  I assume that the rest of a 100GB HDD is taken up with Windows.\n\n*\n\n*I've done all that I can think of to recover as much as space as I could, so if I install Ubuntu what will I have to work with?\n\n\n*Do I format the HDD and start from scratch or should I only install over Windows?\n\nA: You have choices when you install, dual boot, wubi, or install into the entire hard drive. You can format the drive as a part of the installation.\nI suggest you boot the live \"cd\" (from a flash drive), test your system, and if all looks good, start the installer. \nOn the partitioning section you can use the entire disk if you wish.\n\nA: Once you get to the installer you can chose if you want to install next to your operating system or over it entirely. There is also an option 'something else' but do not touch it if you are not sure what you are doing.If your vista is corrupted then I suggest installing over it. Your question is a little unclear btw. I am not sure what you are asking for.\nHere is the download page for ubuntu btw:\nhttp://www.ubuntu.com/download/desktop\n\nA: I would suggest you to download Ubuntu from here (first try 64-Bit, if there should be any errors, retry with 32 bit) and then follow the following instructions to install Ubuntu:\nHow to install Ubuntu 13.04\nOther than in the pictures there, I would choose \"Replace Windows Vista with Ubuntu\". \nBut remark: This will delete all your files you have on your PC. Take a back up, if you don't know how:\n\n\n*\n\n*Download Ubuntu from the link above\n\n*Burn it to a dvd\n\n*restart your computer, but boot from the dvd, usually you have to press F12 during the first seconds of the boot process to select the device\n\n*Wait, and select then try ubuntu. \n\n*Open \"Files\" and copy all your files to an external hard drive, a usb stick or a cloud.\n\n", "Q: Firefox history & bookmarks don't save, tried everything in the book Now, before I begin, I would like to say that I am a fairly advanced user. I know how things work, and I troubleshoot. Therefore as such, I have deleted my profile, recreated it, tested new ones, deleted .mozilla, purged, reinstalled, checked about:config (and changing values which seem to contradict saving history), deleted Firefox and Xmarks, and even manually deleted the folders and remade them.\nThe .mozilla directory has ALL my user permissions. I made sure of this. Clearing history does NOT generate a new one. History is set to be remembered, and is NOT set to clear when Firefox closes. I have already checked.\nIf creating a new profile doesn't solve my issue, then how can places.sqlite be the problem (as is suggested over at Mozilla's Mozine/KB)? I've already deleted my Firefox profiles countless times and made countless more new ones, so I hardly doubt it's that now.\nMain issue: I open Firefox, I browse, and no history is ever saved when I restart the browser. No bookmarks get saved either, and if I bookmark a page (sometimes before it hasn't even let me), it won't even show up in the bookmarks menu. And it's also worth noting that the history always never saves either.\nWhat does work: Firefox preferences are saved, add-ons, configurations, downloads, extensions, and anything else that isn't explicitly bookmarks or browsing history. Don't know about form history since I don't use that.\nI use Firefox 24 on Ubuntu 13.04.\nPlease help me, I've run out of options and ideas!\n\nA: Open your Firefox & go to Help > Troubleshooting Information\nThere you will have a reset button , that will restores the Firefox to its normal behavior.\n\nFor more information\nhttps://support.mozilla.org/en-US/products/firefox/fix-problems/firefox-wont-save-settings-or-remember-information\n\nA: It's probably not much of a solution, but I installed Google Chrome, imported everything from Firefox, then nuked everything \"Mozilla\" related.

I am using Ubuntu 12.04 at work and we have a proxy server.  I would like to allow guests to use my computer on the guest account, but I cannot get the proxy settings to stay.  Is there a way to set the proxy setting automatically at log-in for the guest account?  The AskUbuntu question Change default guest session launcher applications? shows how to configure the launcher icons.  Can I use this file to set a persistent proxy server setting?  If so, how?\n\nA: Most likely you can use the same approach as in the other question, provided that you figure out what the command is. In 12.04 I think it would be gconftool-2 rather than gsettings.\nHowever, if you go to System Settings -> Network -> Network proxy, there is an \"Apply system wide\" button (at least in 13.04). Making the proxy settings system wide is possibly a simpler way to achieve what you want.\nAnother possibility: I wrote a tutorial about guest session customization. The tutorial was originally published at Ubuntu Forums, and there a user added a step-by-step guide showing an alternative method to customize guest sessions.\n", "Q: No smb.conf file after installing samba 4.0.9 Samba won't start and I've done 'locate smb.conf' but it can't be found.

Is there a way to associate saved html files with their \"files\" folders so that they can be deleted together, like in windows?\n\nA: MS Word is the only application I know that saves HTML files in a 'files' folder, and associates js/css/images to their (encoded) html page. Is that what you mean?  \nNo browser I am aware of, not even Internet Explorer in Windows, saves entire site directories for you in the same manner as does Microsoft Word can save related items to a Files folder.\nBrowser files are usually saved to the 'Downloads' directory if actually downloaded, otherwise they are cached.  In either case, you have to purge individual files or all files, there is no 'convenient' association of HTML files to their image/js/css files when floating in a download or cache folder.\nThat said, you might investigate Star Office or OfficeLibre and see if their Writer has the same ability to save HTML pages and their associated content in a single folder as MS Word can/does.\n\nA: There is this in MS Windows:  \n\nHTML documents can be connected to related files, such as graphics files or style sheets. When the document is moved or copied, the connected files are automatically moved or copied as well.\n  From: Managing the File System\n\nAs far as I can tell, such a feature isn't available in Ubuntu.

I would create a folder called say /media/diskXYZ . Then I would make a softlink from /media/user1/diskXYZ to /media/diskXYZ , and from /media/user2/diskXYZ to /media/diskXYZ . The intention is that two users can have the disk mounted at the same time, and programs that have a folder name \nhardwired in will work whichever user mounted it. I didn't want to do it because I wasn't sure if it was safe.\n\n\n*\n\n*Will it work?\n\n*Is this safe?\n\n\nA: *\n\n*Will it work? The answer depends on how the permissions are set on the folder. No matter if it's linked or not, if the user is not privileged to access the directory, the user will not be able to.\n\n*Is this safe? It's safe if it does work, but you probably want to do this the correct way.......\n\n\nHow to mount a device so that other users have access to it:\nFirst, with the device unmounted, make an entry for the device on a new line in /etc/fstab, making sure that there is still a final new line at the end of the file. It should look something like:\nUUID=<uuid> /media/<mountpoint> ext4 user,defaults 0 1\n\nOr:\n/dev/XYZ /media/<mountpoint> ext4 user,defaults 0 1\n\nReplace <uuid> with the UUID of the drive, <mountpoint> with the directory under /media that you want it to mount in, and /dev/XYZ to the device's name.\nSecond, make a new group and add the two users to it with:\nsudo groupadd <group name>\nsudo adduser <user1> <group name>\nsudo adduser <user2> <group name>\n\nThen make sure the mountpoint is owned by the group:\nsudo chgrp -hR /media/<mountpoint> <group name>\n\nMount the drive with sudo mount /dev/XYZ or reboot.\nThis method will avoid messing around with symbolic links!\n", "Q: Combined address/search bar in firefox For a long time on Windows and OSX, Firefox has had combined search and address bar without recourse to any addon. I am running Ubuntu and the search and address bar is separate and I can't find any option to do this in the preferences and about:config. Do I have to use an addon ?\n\nA: You can just remove the search box. The address bar should have the same behavior (auto-search).\nIf it does not, you can try changing the keyword.URL setting.\n\nA: You need to install Foobar Firefox extension.

Remember, you may need to change the boot order inside your BIOS to have the your DVD drive boot first.\nStep two: After the installation or recovery disc loads, if prompted, select your language settings and then continue.  If you are using the installation DVD, when prompted by the following screen select Repair your computer. \nStep three: The computer will take a moment now to scan itself for any Windows installations, after which you will likely be given a choice to select which installation you wish to repair.  Select the appropriate Windows installation from the list and then continue. If by chance a problem is detected in one of your Windows installations at this initial stage, the system may also ask you if it can try to repair the problem automatically. It is up to you if you wish to let the system try to repair itself, but otherwise just select No.  \nStep four: Once you have reached the System Recovery Options screen, as shown below, you will be faced with a list of choices that can aid you in repairing a damaged Windows 7 operating system.  If you wish to try the Startup Repair option first, it is often successful in automatically fixing many different start up issues, but in this article we will be using the Command Prompt option to resolve our problems manually. So, click Command Prompt to continue.  \nStep five: Now sitting at the command prompt, enter the following command and then press enter:\n     bootrec.exe /FixMbr\n\nIf successful, you should be greeted with the message The operation completed successfully.  That's it!  Your Master Boot Record has been repaired.\nWhile the above command does fix the MBR, and sometimes that is enough, there still might be an error with the system partition's boot sector and Boot Configuration Data (BCD). This might occur if you have tried to install another operating system alongside Windows 7, such as Windows XP.  To write a new boot sector, try the following command:\n    bootrec.exe /FixBoot\n\nIf you are still faced with your Windows 7 installation not being detected during start up, or if you wish to include more than one operating system choice to your system's boot list, you can try the following command to rebuild your BCD:\n    bootrec.exe /RebuildBcd\n\nThe above command will scan all your disks for other operating systems compatible with Windows 7 and allow you to add them to your system's boot list.\nAfter you have done this you can reboot your computer and let windows start to make sure it is working.\nIf it is then shut down your computer and reconnect your Ubuntu SSD.\nStart your computer and press whatever key is needed for you to select the drive you want to boot to which is going to be ubuntu.\nWhen ubuntu starts open up Synaptic and install a program called BOOT-REPAIR\nYou can easily use that to fix any boot problems in ubuntu\n", "Q: What went wrong with this partition mount?

I've check /etc/ssl/certs folder but I couldn't find the one that I've just imported. Also, how I can manage certificates after being imported (list them and remove)?\n\nA: You need to install the certificate in /etc/ssl/certs/ manually. Additionally, you will want to add it to /etc/ssl/certs/ca-certificates.crt for applications that cannot deal with the directory format. For this, you first need to convert it from DER to PEM:\nopenssl x509 -in foo.der -inform der -out foo.pem\n\nThen you install it into the system-wide certificate storage:\nsudo openssl x509 -in foo.pem -out /etc/ssl/certs/$(openssl x509 -in foo.pem -noout -hash).0\nsudo sh -c 'cat foo.pem >>/etc/ssl/certs/ca-certificates.crt'\n\n", "Q: Chrome and Catalyst - no tab text I just installed Ubuntu, updated, installed AMD proprietary drivers (for my Radeon HD6870) and noticed that some (most) of the tabs in Google Chrome don't have text, only the favicon.\nMy first idea was that maybe 13.10 may have some issues with the new drivers so I switched to the normal driver instead of the beta one.

With Radeon HD 6000 series, especially your Radeon HD 6870, it is more advisable to use the open source drivers instead of Catalyst.

I'm not sure how to do this though.\nI suppose I can use ssh or something, but that's a bit too advanced. I just want to be able to click around and drag-and-drop the files and folders that I want to transfer.\nDoes anybody know an easy way in which I can do this?\n\nA: You need to buy a special cable called a USB Data Transfer Cable. People often confuse this cable with an ordinary cable that has USB connections on each end. If you use an ordinary cable to connect both computers you will almost certainly cause both computers to burn up very quickly.\n", "Q: Where can I find an ISO of 12.04 for ARM? All I've found is PXE boot files, but no actual ISO image for the whole distribution.  I need an ISO image because I can't get through the firewall to let the machine pull packages directly from the source.  So, is there a 12.04 ARM image available somewhere?  How do I get it, please?\n\nA: There is none for non-OMAP chip. According to the wiki you will need to start with netinstall or bootimages depending the case:\n\n\n*\n\n*OMAP images can be found in the release page (12.04.3): http://cdimage.ubuntu.com/releases/13.04/release/ubuntu-13.04-server-armhf+omap.img\n\n*TEGRA based devices requires:\n\n\n*\n\n*Mini-usb cable\n\n*Host computer with linux (virtual or physical)\n\n*Usb-stick or sd-card (min. 1GB)\n\n*About 1-2h of your life (depending on the download-time)\n\n\nAlso download:\n\n\n*\n\n*There are two AC100 related files in the 12.04 release directory: \n\n*Bootimage\n\n*Presinstalled rootfs\n\n*nvflash: which is used to flash via a mini-USB cable the bootimage\n\n\nMore detailed instructions here.\n\n*IMX53: is only available up Oneiric 11.10 http://cdimage.ubuntu.com/releases/oneiric/release/ubuntu-11.10-preinstalled-desktop-armel+mx5.img.gz\n\n*There is other guide for Marvell Armada XP but those aren't commercially available according to the wiki.\n\n\nA: The entire ARM Architecture is extremely fragmented, essentially only the the processor architecture is consistent.  The platform differs between boards, so the concept of a generically bootable ISO is unrealistic.  Beyond the OS level difficulties, such as almost universally closed drivers, the boot mechanisms aren't standardized.\nI would think of just getting something installed as embedded development, and work is required for each new device. Some devices have small communities, and if you're lucky images and install instructions can be located. \nUbuntu officially supports a VERY small list of development boards, apparently they also drop-off sometimes... :(  It's not really their fault, since the fragmentation puts an unrealistic load on distributions and developers. It still is unfortunate, especially when considering just how much potential exists with ARM.\nI may be able to help, but you must add which device/board you have available.  I also want to mention these problems would disappear if/when a standardized platform/boot environment is specified and followed, such as UEFI/ACPI.\n", "Q: Permissions issue in eclipse I am running Eclipse Indigo in Ubuntu 12.04.3. I checked out a project from subversion and put it in my workspace. When I try to run Main.CPP (it's a C++ project -- not java), I get the following error message:\n\nException occurred executing command line.\nCannot run program \"/home/abramhandler/workspace/tux/main.cpp\" (in directory   \"/home/abramhandler/workspace/tux\"): java.io.IOException:\n\nerror=13, Permission denied\n\nHow can I give Eclipse permission to run things in this folder?\n\nA: There is no need to give Eclipse permission to run things in that folder; it already has that permission. The Permission denied error is due to the shell refusing to execute main.cpp because the file doesn't have its execute permission bits set. Which makes sense because you don't execute cpp files.\n", "Q: conected to wireless but can't access any page I installed ubuntu 13.04 in an acer apire one notebook.  I can access my wireless conection and even i can use ssh but i can't go to any page using firefox or chromium.\nWhere is the problem?\n\nA: I suspect that there is some sort of Port Forwarding problem.\nCheck your port forwarding configuration and delete everything\nthen add back just what you know you need. \nAlso check to see if you enabled using wireless or eth0.\nIf your connection is disabled you will experience this trouble as well.\nAnother thing is to check if there is a needed password.\nYou might want to simply delete all the networks and refresh\nthem then make sure you have entered the correct password\nas well as selecting the correct security WEP, WPA, WPA2\n\nA: Try: dhclient wlan0 I had exactly the same problem and it helped.\n", "Q: Unable To Install Ubuntu 13.04 on Alienware 17 So I go to boot Ubuntu from USB and I get to the Ubuntu boot screen, but when I go to install it I get a black screen but I hear the sounds. My computer uses UEFI with secure boot; when I turn it off it does not fix the issue, same with legacy boot. It should also be noted that legacy boot makes it so it doesn't recognize Win 8 (already installed). Can anyone assist with this issue?\n\nA: 13.04 will be outdated in about 10 days from today, download the latest version (Ubuntu 13.10) and when you disable the UEFI boot and activate legacy boot make sure you you really are loading the USB via legacy and not EFI mode, if you are getting a black screen to select the option to install ubuntu you are doing it through EFI and it is giving you problems, if you do it through legacy you will see a purple GUI.\n\nA: I had this same problem with same pc. My problem was the distribution. I put 13.10 on a usb and booted to that (hit F12 at startup). Installed to a previously set up partition on the second hdd. Make sure fast boot is off and secure boot is off.

I have a large zip that contain hundreds of files. I've unzip'ed it in more than one machine and didn't have any problem before. However, for this particular machine (Ubuntu Server 12.04) I keep getting CRC error for some of the files inside my zip. I've unzip'ed the same file on anther machine just to check if the file itself is corrupted, however it seems to be fine. \nAny clue?\n\nA: If it's the same file(s) each time, the zip file probably got corrupted, possibly when transferring to the machine. Confirm the md5sum or sha1sum of the zip file . \nIf it's random files, you probably have defective hardware. First guess would be bad RAM. You can try memtest86+. \n(BTW, if it's bad RAM, you may find that running md5sum multiple times give different checksums.) \n", "Q: How do I disable screen blanking in Ubuntu Touch I have a Nexus 7 on my desk which I am using as a \"second\" screen as I work.

As such I don't want the screen to blank at all as it's plugged into a charger and I want it to always be displaying something.\nHow can I disable the screen blanking so my screen always stays on, until I press the power button to blank it manually?\n\nA: It will be in System Settings -> Battery, once Bug #1230345 is fixed.  Apparently the control over this is moving from powerd to unity8, and until that's done the option in System Settings has been hidden.\n", "Q: Need to deactivate NVIDIA driver from recovery mode or using Ubuntu 12.04 install disk I tried switching graphics drivers from 317 to 304(post-release) because it kept crashing when I wanted to move my monitor's display to the other side of the laptop display (using NVIDIA Settings)\nNow Ubuntu won't boot at all.  It just crashes and leaves a blinking cursor but I can't type anything.\nI want to switch the graphics driver back to the old one using recovery mode or the Ubuntu install disk so I can boot again.  How can I do this?\n\nA: I figured it out\nFrom recovery mode, select networking.

Do I lose anything or does it all just default to the new mount point?\n\nA: If you just changed the mount point in your fstab, without copying files over, then the contents that were in /usr/local/ will appear in /usr/. The original contents of /usr/ would be hidden from the OS.\nBecause /usr/ contains many of your system settings, libraries, binaries, and other important files, I am sure that your system would not work properly after remapping the drive's mount point.\nIn effect, the OS would not be able to find anything it would be looking for in /usr/ or its subdirectories (including /usr/local). The /usr/ directory is full of libraries which include symbolic links, and some of it's files have very specific ownership and permissions requirements.\nI would not suggest changing the mount points, copying, or moving these files unless you have to. \n", "Q: How can I delete all .LNK files on my Ubuntu machine?

New installation coming up. 120gb SSD for OS and HOME and 1tb HDD for storage. 16gb of ram which means 16gb of swap if I recall correctly. SSD space is too valuable for a swap partition right? If my thinking is correct can someone guide me through or point me in the right direction for putting a swap partition on a second hard drive? I have always selected the automatic settings when installing ubuntu. Thanks!\n\nA: Apart from the other great answers, I just wanted to ask that you can have more than one swap partition. So you could put 4GiB of swap on the SSD and the rest in the HDD so if you need to swap something during your computers usage it goes to the fast swap. If you hibernate, probably the SSD swap won't be enough and you'll need the HDD swap too.\nTo do this, you'll need to create one swap partition in each disk, and once installed you'll need to open /etc/fstab so your system gives preference to the fast swap. So open a terminal and execute sudo gedit /etc/fstab. You'll need to locate the pair of lines referencing your swap partitions, and edit them to add the pri setting (a higher number on the fastest disk):\n# before\nUUID=some-large-number  none  swap    sw   0 0\nUUID=another-large-number  none   swap  sw  0 0\n\n#after\nUUID=some-large-number  none  swap    sw,pri=10   0 0\nUUID=another-large-number  none   swap  sw,pri=20  0 0\n\nYou need to know which of this is in the fast disk and which on the slow disk. Executing the blkid on the terminal will help you identifying each one.\n\nA: SSDs are faster (although speeds decrease in time here too) but also have a smaller lifespan. Before making this choice think about the swapping habits of your distro. \nCorrect me if I'm wrong but this setup is your home PC, right? With 16GB I really doubt that you'll be doing much swapping especially since for example hibernation rarely works properly and is disabled in Ubuntu by default.\nAs an alternative to a swap partition you can use a swap file. The huge advantage with the second is that it can grow and shrink according to your needs where a partition is usually harder to deal with especially if it is between two other partitions and there is no space left.\nRead here for more information on SSD for swap space:\n\n\n*\n\n*Swap Space on SSDs\n\n*Tips for Minimizing SSD Read/Writes\nFor swap size see:\n\n\n*\n\n*How much swap do I need?\n\nA: Personally with 16gb of memory to your disposal I wouldn't even bother with a swap partition...  Just make sure that you add the following line to the end of the /etc/sysctl.conf file and things should run as normal:\nvm.swappiness = 0\n...save and reboot and no swap needed...  I use this for my 2gb machine and never had a problem or slowdown since...\n\nA: A swap partition on your SSD will let you wake up faster from hibernation (aka \"suspend to disk\") as compared to swap on a hard drive. But given the incredibly fast boot time of Ubuntu when booting from SSD a wake up from hibernation may be slower than a reboot.\nIf you do not hibernate you may never need to swap at all.\nOnly in case you often have very many RAM intensive applications running in parallel, your system may eventually use swap. Then a swap on SSD will be somewhat faster than a swap on a hard drive. Still there is no need to worry about wearing of your SSD from extensive swapping.\nIf not used for hibernation you can alway add a swap partition or swap on file later:\n\n\n*\n\n*How do I add a swap partition after system installation?\n\n*Adding a new swap file.

One runs only Ubuntu 12.04 and the other only Windows Vista.\nI really only care about being able to backup my Ubuntu laptop to the NTFS drive on the desktop over the network. I guess the tricky part is that it's NTFS (can't get rid of Windows entirely yet).\nI've been reading and reading and I'm close. I've installed samba, ntfs-config and ntfs-3g and I CAN access, read and write to the drive from my Ubuntu laptop.\nThis is why I can't understand why I get error messages like \"Failed to mount Windows share\" from programs like Deja Dup. I could easily copy my files to the NTFS drive directly but a proper backup tool obviously has major advantages...I just can't get any of them to work.\nWhat samba settings are needed?\nWhat ntfs-config settings are needed?\nWhat deja dup settings are needed?\nIsn't the drive already mounted if I'm able to access it from the laptop?\n\nA: You can mount your network share on the NTFS drive using /etc/fstab of your Ubuntu laptop. First of all you will need to install cifs-utils package. Create mountpoint in /mnt folder where the network share will be mapped, /mnt/NTFS for example. Then add the following line to your fstab file:\n//IP_of_Network_Machine/Shared_folder /mnt/NTFS cifs iocharset=utf8,credentials=/home/Username/.sambapass,file_mode=0777,dir_mode=0777 0 0\n\nYou also need to create /home/Username/.sambapass which will contain your network login and password to access the network share:\nusername=DOMAIN_or_WORKGROUP/Network_login\npassword=Network_password\n\nChange keyfile's default permission to increase security and make it inaccessible by other users:\nsudo chmod 600 /home/Username/.sambapass\n\nOn the next login your network share will be mounted automatically. Now this network share will exist in your filesystem as any local folder and can be easily accessed by any backup software.\n", "Q: Wine and Ubuntu 13.04 - 64 Bit I have been trying to install Wine on my 13.04 64 bit computer, and everytime it leads to synaptic asking for the uninstall of the entire system. \nI have been following some questions which suggest the addition of the Wine repository (also recomended on the WineHQ) website, followed by sudo apt-get update and sudo apt-get install wine1.5. \nThe system cries, with the following messages:\nConstruction de l'arbre des dépendances       \nLecture des informations d'état...

You either have a device, or you have a mapped device.

Which antivirus is good and in real-time (I mean that, if I try to open an infected file or go to a bad website, it stops it). \nI read a post in ubuntuguide and here is a part of it:\n Anti-virus\nIf you are running a file server, interface frequently with Windows drives or share files with Windows users, or use virtualization, you will want a virus checker for your Windows files. \nDespite extensive misinformation, Linux is not immune from malware (witness the explosion of malware being created for the Linux-based Google Android systems). The malware is not usually spread within the OS itself (as long as the OS is a well-respected distribution obtained through official channels), but in trojan programs downloaded and installed by users outside of the normal software distribution channels (i.e. repositories) of the OS. There is always a danger to using programs downloaded from the Internet from sources other than respected repositories -- it is the primary reason that Debian and (K)Ubuntu retain tight control over their software repositories. \nAny file can have malware embedded in it (which is trivial to achieve by concatenation, for example: cat originalfile.avi malware.exe > originalfileplusmalware.avi). The question is whether a user will try to open a file with a program (such as a media player) that has been compromised in a way that allows it to execute the code found in the infected media (e.g. .avi) file. This can occur not only for Windows users but for any OS (including Mac OSX and Linux) with a compromised program (e.g. media player). An example is the extensive problems the Mac OS community is currently having with the Flash player. \nRoutine scanning of any file downloaded from the Internet, any file imported from another user's computer (even a trusted source, since their attention to virus prevention may not be as compulsive as yours), or any attachment received in an email (even from a trusted sender) should be done with an anti-virus program. So I think that there is a need for anti-virus in Ubuntu.\n\nA: As others have noted, you probably do not need it. However, comodo, kaspersky and few others offer real-time antivirus protection\n\nA: Don't think there are any real-time antivirus programs for Linux that scans websites etc. on the run.\n\nA: There is no need of a one. If such a virus comes specifically for Linux, there will be always a way to remove it. Can you seriously find such virus for Linux??\n\nA: How To Install Comodo Antivirus For Linux 1.1 X86-64 On Ubuntu 12.10 - Desktop X86-64:\nhttp://postbin.djun.net/pages/article11.php\nYou should note that it only scans for WINDOWS viruses, as do most antiviral tools for linux.\n\nA: I've tried loading the Comodo one, the download link fails. I installed the Sophos Antivirus for Linux It was pretty easy to get and install on my Debian install. I just do it for the same reason their site says \"To prevent the Linux machine from becoming a distribution point,...\" I would be remiss if I just stored inert viruses on my Computer for my Windows machines to pick up at some point. Sophos scans for all platform malware, not just linux \"threats.\" If the link fails in the future, it's in their \"Free Tools\" section.  \nAlso several tools work in Chromium as extensions for checking safety of domains. Avira has one that works across platforms in Chrome. Also, using a DNS that is filtered is really a great starting point! Like the ones available at OpenDNS, which are free, and help filter out known malicious domains before you can proceed to them. \n\nA: There are antivirus software available for Ubuntu, but, you should use Intrusion Detection Prevention System and configure your Firewall very well. This would help to protect your system. Linux is no more immune to viruses, that is why I suggest you use IDPS and internal Firewall.  \nFor IDS, Snort is available here: Snort Page\nand for Firewall in Ubuntu you have to type following command in Terminal:\n\n\n*\n\n*sudo ufw enable - This will enable Firewall in your system.\n\n*sudo ufw status - This will show the status of your Firewall\nand also use iptables for defining rules. \n\n\nTo know currently configured rules in iptables type the following command:\n\n\n*iptables -L\nYou may learn about iptables from this link: \nIptables Page\n\nA: Not sure but Avast might (it does in Windows)\nHow to Ubuntu\nAlso you can use Firefox and install the extension 'WOT'.  It's not an anti-virus but it will warn you about potential attack sites you might click on. \n", "Q: Extracting a tar ball fails with \"Cannot open: Not a directory\" I am trying to extract an tarball, I keep getting this error\ntar: mediatek/custom/common/lk/lcm/bp101wx1_n/bp101wx1_n.c: Cannot open: Not a directory\ntar: mediatek/custom/common/lk/lcm/hsd070idw1/hsd070idw1.c: Cannot open: Not a directory\ntar: mediatek/custom/common/lk/lcm/nt35582/nt35582.c: Cannot open: Not a directory\ntar: mediatek/custom/common/lk/lcm/r63311_fhd_dsi_vdo_sharp/r63311_fhd_dsi_vdo_sharp.c: Cannot open: Not a directory\ntar: mediatek/custom/common/lk/lcm/otm9608_wvga_dsi_cmd/otm9608_wvga_dsi_cmd.c: Cannot open: Not a directory\ntar: mediatek/custom/common/lk/lcm/lg4571/lg4571.c: Cannot open: Not a directory\ntar: mediatek/custom/common/lk/lcm/hx8363b_wvga_dsi_cmd/hx8363b_wvga_dsi_cmd.c: Cannot open: Not a directory\ntar: mediatek/custom/common/lk/lcm/lg4573b_wvga_dsi_vdo_lh430mv1/lg4573b_wvga_dsi_vdo_lh430mv1.c: Cannot open: Not a directory\ntar: Exiting with failure status due to previous errors\n\nThe original file was a .zip file that contained a .tar.gz file, so I first used unzip then I used pigz with the -d option to create the tar file. \nI extracted the tar file using tar with xf option.\nExtracting the tar.gz using the tar xzf also doesn't work :/\nUsing 7za I get \ncan not open output file mediatek/custom/common/lk/lcm/bm8578/bm8578.c\ncan not open output file mediatek/custom/common/lk/lcm/nt35565_qhd_dsi_cmd/nt35565_qhd_dsi_cmd.c\ncan not open output file mediatek/custom/common/lk/lcm/spfd5461a/spfd5461a.c\ncan not open output file mediatek/custom/common/lk/lcm/bp101wx1_n/bp101wx1_n.c\ncan not open output file mediatek/custom/common/lk/lcm/hsd070idw1/hsd070idw1.c\ncan not open output file mediatek/custom/common/lk/lcm/nt35582/nt35582.c\ncan not open output file mediatek/custom/common/lk/lcm/r63311_fhd_dsi_vdo_sharp/r63311_fhd_dsi_vdo_sharp.c\ncan not open output file mediatek/custom/common/lk/lcm/otm9608_wvga_dsi_cmd/otm9608_wvga_dsi_cmd.c\ncan not open output file mediatek/custom/common/lk/lcm/lg4571/lg4571.c\ncan not open output file mediatek/custom/common/lk/lcm/hx8363b_wvga_dsi_cmd/hx8363b_wvga_dsi_cmd.c\ncan not open output file mediatek/custom/common/lk/lcm/lg4573b_wvga_dsi_vdo_lh430mv1/lg4573b_wvga_dsi_vdo_lh430mv1.c\n\nSub items Errors: 3869\n\nThe tar file is 3.8 GB if that matters\n\nA: According to here you can do tar -xvzf location.tar.gz.

I can't put my finger on when, but in 12.04, I just started noticing that the PPTP service was crashing every 2-5 minutes, making VPN essentially unusable.  Finding nothing satisfying in the forums, I decided to be a little more bold and upgrade - both to check out the new version and hopefully have VPN automatically be repaired.  By the way, it's been working great until just recently on 12.04 and it doesn't work at all now.\nSo, it's completely and inexplicably broken on 13.04.  It seems that the pppd daemon is just gone.  Hunting down how to reinstall it didn't yield much of anything.  There were Launchpad bugs reported related to this but no resolution.\nHere's my syslog when I try to connect.  As you can see, it doesn't even start now:\nOct  1 15:07:20 Shuttle NetworkManager[1011]: <info> Starting VPN service 'pptp'...\nOct  1 15:07:20 Shuttle NetworkManager[1011]: <info> VPN service 'pptp' started (org.freedesktop.NetworkManager.pptp), PID 6436\nOct  1 15:07:20 Shuttle NetworkManager[1011]: <info> VPN service 'pptp' appeared; activating connections\nOct  1 15:07:20 Shuttle NetworkManager[1011]: <info> VPN plugin state changed: init (1)\nOct  1 15:07:20 Shuttle NetworkManager[1011]: <info> VPN plugin state changed: starting (3)\nOct  1 15:07:20 Shuttle NetworkManager[1011]: <info> VPN connection 'Strong PPTP' (Connect) reply received.\nOct  1 15:07:20 Shuttle NetworkManager[1011]: <warn> VPN connection 'Strong PPTP' failed to connect: 'Could not find the pppd binary.'.\nOct  1 15:07:20 Shuttle NetworkManager[1011]: <info> Policy set 'The 'Net' (eth0) as default for IPv4 routing and DNS.\nOct  1 15:07:20 Shuttle NetworkManager[1011]: <warn> error disconnecting VPN: Could not process the request because no VPN connection was active.\nOct  1 15:07:26 Shuttle NetworkManager[1011]: <info> VPN service 'pptp' disappeared\n\nI'll do what it takes to get this working, but this seems so fundamental to the OS.  Any ideas?\nWhy would this be so hard to repair?\n\nA: Update on this:  After sleeping on this problem, I suddenly remembered a long forgotten friend:  Synaptic Package Manager.  So, I opened that up, removed everything related to PPTP, then reinstalled it.  I then installed some extra stuff in the hopes that it would repair the pppd daemon:  OpenVPN and the PPP daemon itself.\nAnd, lo and behold, it worked!  I've got to remember that next time!\n\nA: I had the same problem when attempting to connect the VPN---'Could not find the pppd binary.'---perhaps related to an upgrade from Ubuntu 10.10 to 12.04.  I fixed it by removing and reinstalling the PPP daemon using the Ubuntu Software Center.  Removing the PPP daemon also forced removing network-manager-pptp, pppconfig, pppoeconf, and pptp-linux, so after reinstalling the PPP daemon, I had to re-install the first three of these (pptp-linux had been reinstalled automatically, apparently).  After reinstalling, the VPN works as expected.\nSo, in my case I did not have to use Synaptic and I did not have to install OpenVPN.\n\nA: From the software center, search for ppp and remove it / reinstall it. You can install everything form the terminal using this:\nsudo apt-get install ppp network-manager-pptp pppconfig pppoeconf pptp-linux\n\nThis is a typical VPN Connection settings, from Connections, go to VPN Connections and add a new one/edit exiting or skip this if you had it setup:\n\nVPN Type: PPTP\nGateway: vpn.your-vpn-domain.com\nuser name: myuserid\npassword: Active Directory Pass/LDAP, etc..\nNT Domain:  N/A , blank (not specified)\nAdvanced:\nauth-methods: All Selected (will try all)\nUse Point to Point encryption MPPE: (checked)\nAllow BSD Data encryption (checked)\nAllow deflate data compression (checked)\nuse TCP header compression (checked)\nSend PPP echo packets (unchecked)\n\nRefer to this answer for a more graphical set of instructions.\nThis worked great for me, prior to that I would get the VPN plugin failed error.\n", "Q: Ubuntu 12.04 lts graphic problem i'm using Ubuntu 12.04 lts , \ni installed compiz and after some day i uninstalled it \nbut after unistalling something bad has happened\nmy graphic now is something like this :\n\nwhat can i do to make it like before?\nthanks in advance,\n\nA: The problem here is compositing is disabled, which means you won't get effects like transparency and shadow.

However I cannot find any corresponding USN for CVE-2012-0883 although I did find this:\nhttp://people.canonical.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/2012/CVE-2012-0883.html\nAnd if Ubuntu is not affected by the vulnerability, what version of Apache contains the fix?\n\nA: It's clearly written in the page you have linked:\n\nUpstream:                               released (2.4.2)\nUbuntu 8.04 LTS (Hardy Heron):          not-affected\nUbuntu 10.04 LTS (Lucid Lynx):          not-affected\nUbuntu 11.04 (Natty Narwhal):           not-affected\nUbuntu 11.10 (Oneiric Ocelot):          not-affected\nUbuntu 12.04 LTS (Precise Pangolin):    not-affected\n\nAlso, in the same page, there's written:\n\njdstrand> Debian/Ubuntu packages contain 038_no_LD_LIBRARY_PATH (see\n  http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=276670 for more information)\n\nAnd if you look at the changelog included in the bug you can see:\n\napache2 (2.0.52-2) unstable; urgency=high\n[...]\n  * Move envvars to /etc/apache2/ and add patch 038_no_LD_LIBRARY_PATH to\n    remove the extraneous LD_LIBRARY_PATH from envvars (closes: #276670)\n\nThis means that the bug has been fixed in Debian since version 2.0.52.\nLast but not least, if you look at your /etc/apache2/envvars or /usr/share/apache2/build/envvars-std, you'll see that they don't contain any malicious LD_LIBRARY_PATH.\n", "Q: Reading all files from a directory Following code is to read all files in download directory,but when i execute this code it won't print(display), what is wrong with this code..?\nimport glob   \npath = '/home/mypc/download/*.html'   \nfiles=glob.glob(path)   \nfor file in files:     \n    f=open(file, 'r')  \n    f.readlines()   \n    f.close() \n\n\nA: The readlines() method of a file object returns a Python list. It does not automatically write on stdout the contents of the file: Python is a scripting language, but not a shell scriping language!\nYou should replace:\nf.readlines()\n\nwith:\nsys.stdout.write(f.read())\n\nNote that I'm using read() instead of readlines(). As I said, readlines() returns a list, but here we want to print a string -- and read() does what we want: it reads the whole file and returns a string. It's not optimal when the file is huge (because it will use a huge amount of memory), but it works.\nIt's worth noting that you code is flawed. You said: following code is to read all files in download directory. Your code actually will attempt to read both files and directories ending with .html. If your code finds a directory ending with .html, it will loudly crash.\nLastly, you should prefer using the with statement when opening files, especially when you are opening many files. The with statement will ensure that the file is closed as soon as you have finished working with it, even if an error occurs.\nTherefore your code should look like this:\nimport sys\nimport glob\nimport errno\n\npath = '/home/mypc/download/*.html'   \nfiles = glob.glob(path)   \nfor name in files: # 'file' is a builtin type, 'name' is a less-ambiguous variable name.\n    try:\n        with open(name) as f: # No need to specify 'r': this is the default.\n            sys.stdout.write(f.read())\n    except IOError as exc:\n        if exc.errno != errno.EISDIR: # Do not fail if a directory is found, just ignore it.\n            raise # Propagate other kinds of IOError.\n\n\nA: You may want to use at least one print. For example:\n#!/usr/bin/env python\n\nimport glob   \npath = '/home/mypc/download/*.html'   \nfiles=glob.glob(path)   \nfor file in files:     \n    f=open(file, 'r')  \n    print '%s' % f.readlines()   \n    f.close()\n    #if you want to print only the filenames, use 'print file' instead of three previous lines\n\nAnd please read some documentation about Input and Output in Python.\n\nA: I you want to display the file names you need to use the print command\nimport glob   \npath = '/home/mypc/download/*.html'   \nfiles=glob.glob(path)   \nfor file in files: \n    print file\n\n\nA: You have only written code to read the files, not to print the contents.

The path is set using the PATH environment variable and you can add the following to .profile to set it:\nexport PATH=$PATH:/home/username/programs/bluegriffon\n\nThis appends the new folder to the existing value of the PATH variable so you don't lose the existing contents.\nThe 'export' command makes the value of the environment variable available to subprocesses.\nHope that helps.\n", "Q: Array declaration How can I declare an array in Ubuntu ?

I have one LAN connection and another USB internet modem how I can use both same time for specific applications with out any overlapping? \n\nA: Bridging Networks\nBridging multiple interfaces is a more advanced configuration, but is very useful in multiple scenarios. One scenario is setting up a bridge with multiple network interfaces, then using a firewall to filter traffic between two network segments. Another scenario is using bridge on a system with one interface to allow virtual machines direct access to the outside network. The following example covers the latter scenario.\nBefore configuring a bridge you will need to install the bridge-utils package. To install the package, in a terminal enter:\nsudo apt-get install bridge-utils\nNext, configure the bridge by editing /etc/network/interfaces:\nauto lo\niface lo inet loopback\n\nauto br0\niface br0 inet static\n        address 192.168.0.10\n        network 192.168.0.0\n        netmask 255.255.255.0\n        broadcast 192.168.0.255\n        gateway 192.168.0.1\n        bridge_ports eth0\n        bridge_fd 9\n        bridge_hello 2\n        bridge_maxage 12\n        bridge_stp off\n\nEnter the appropriate values for your physical interface and network.\nNow restart networking to enable the bridge interface:\n\n\n*\n\n*How to restart the networking service?\nThe new bridge interface should now be up and running. The brctl provides useful information about the state of the bridge, controls which interfaces are part of the bridge, etc. See man brctl for more information.\nThis is taken directly from the Ubuntu Documentation: Network Configuration\n", "Q: Why am I shown the Setup Screen (Choose Language) after every reboot? I get the setup screen where it asks me to choose language after I reboot the Ubuntu server. It happens after every reboot. How could I git rid of it?\n\nA: If you are using Ubuntu 12.04 there was a bug with incomplete language support. Try running check-language-support -l en in your terminal (replace en with your current active locale). It will list all missing language packages for this locale. Install these packages using sudo apt-get install (you can copy the list from the output of the previous command) and reboot your system to check whether \"Choose language\" screen is gone.\n", "Q: How do I find out what is running immediately following login?

Is there a similar utility that can track which processes run at login?\n\nA: You use the terminal and look up the processes manually.

For RDP you can specify a different desktop session using the ~/.xsession file on your remote account, for example if it contains\ngnome-session --session=ubuntu-2d\n\nthen you will get a 2d (metacity-based) desktop, which will likely work better over RDP. Alternatively you can install the gnome-session-fallback package and then run a gnome-classic session\ngnome-session --session=gnome-classic\n\nIn VNC the equivalent session-setting is done via the ~/.vnc/xstartup file.

I always installed Ubuntu inside Windows, with a dedicated drive for Ubuntu.\nI did the same thing recently on my new Lenovo laptop. I created a separate drive of 50GB solely for Ubuntu.\nI downloaded Ubuntu 13.04 ISO file and extracted. I copied the extracted folder in the dedicated drive.

It has been renamed to installation.iso. Move that out of the \\ubuntu\\ directory (right out or it gets deleted when you uninstall).\nOnce you have the ISO you can write it to a USB stick.\nSecond, since this is a new Lenovo I am going to assume that it has Windows 8 and boots via  UEFI. If this is not the case, let me know, but even if you do get Wubi booting, it will fail as it cannot work on GPT formatted drives (always come with UEFI and Windows). Refer to this for instructions: Installing Ubuntu on a Pre-Installed Windows 8 (64-bit) System (UEFI Supported)\nSo I would use that USB stick to install and not bother with Wubi.

HDD gets locked, first stays unlocked, Bios WON't ask for HDD Password (of the second, locked HDD) so I end up with above linked errors on bootup and also am unable to acess the second HDD from within Ubuntu, cause it is locked.\nMy expected behaviour would be either: both drives get locked during reboot, or\nNONE of them gets locked, so the state AFTER reboot will be like it was before.\nThanks for answers in  advance.\n\nA: Your expectation is incorrect; it isn't the job of the OS to do this.

If you  use\n              this switch when invoking Emacs from an xterm(1) window,\n              display is done in that window.\n\n\nA: Most utilities, including git respect an environment variable named EDITOR which you can set to any editor you want, including options.  export EDITOR='emacs -nw' will have them run emacs in non windowed mode.\nIn the case of emacs, it has a handy server mode you can start with M-x server-start and then run emacsclient as an editor to open a file in the already running emacs instance.  This is handy since it allows you to retain access to the emacs kill ring and other features.  It also accepts the -nw switch so that it will open a new emacs frame in the terminal window rather than in the gui emacs frame, so it will still look and feel like a text mode emacs session, but still share the kill ring and buffers with the other window(s).\n\nA: You can change this in ~/.gitconfig by adding the following under the section labeled [core]:\n[core]\n        editor = emacs -nw\n\n", "Q: Mouse scroll wheel moves window content too far each gradation On some Linux distributions, such as Ubuntu, moving the scroll wheel causes the window to move too far, usually skipping some content.

I am a repair technician and I have frankly never seen ticking caused by software. Try checking the speakers plugs and see if they are seated properly in the motherboard jacks. Are they clean? Do you get strange sounds when you touch them? Clean the plugs with a napkin before reinserting them. Try hooking your speakers to another computer to see if they have a bad capacitor making the ticking. Look inside your computer and see if any wires are laying on the motherboard.

Fluffy pile carpet or anything like that? I always recommend to people that they buy a can of anti static spray and use it once in a while all around their computer if they have any carpeting. And very lightly mist the computer housing as well. Static can wreak havoc with soundcards and motherboards.\n\nA: Just wanted to share this since this thread is the first that appeared when I Googled \"Ubuntu ticking\"... This is a known issue with Ubuntu and some Intel hardware.  I had this issue on my Acer netbook and also on a Toshiba laptop, both exhibited the same symptoms and the problem was not present with Windows installed.

The purpose of the box is to alleviate the threat of viruses that have access to the network via USB drives.  Please keep in mind that this office needs the highest security possible.  My configuration is attempting to leverage Samba to allow members of the already configured (and highly secure) Windows 2008 Server to access the Samba share.  I have added the user name of each of the people who need to access the Linux box to the system but have not added passwords as the passwords on the Windows Server are required to change quite often.  Attempting to manage a password database on the Linux box is to be avoided if at all possible.\nRequirements:\n\n\n*\n\n*No password authentication required for logged-in Windows users to access Samba share.\n\n*As little manipulation of current Windows security policies as possible.\n\n*All users who access the share should have full read and write permissions (execute is NOT necessary).\n\n\nProblem:\nCurrently, all attempts to connect to the Samba server by unauthenticated users is met with an error on the Windows side saying \"Access to the resource {insert IP address} has been disallowed.\"  Samba is running with the following smb.conf file that I built from scratch: \n[global]\n    workgroup = {Windows Domain Name}\n    server string = Removable Media Server\n    security = share\n[media]\n    path = /media\n    writable = yes\n    browsable = yes\n    guest ok = yes\n    guest only = yes\n    force directory mode = 0666\n    force create mode = 0666\n\nSamba version is 3.6.9.

The modules in Recovery Mode aren't loaded fully as they should assure the maximum compatibility with any video card. Hence if you want a Normal Boot the best way is starting Ubuntu without using the \"Resume boot\" option.\n", "Q: Setting up Postfix with amavisd-new, spamassassin, clamav, and SPF checking? I am working on learning how to setup a mail server and have a question regarding the use of mail filters with Postfix.\nI am looking at the following guide (as well as a similar guide on the Ubuntu wiki):\nhttps://help.ubuntu.com/12.04/serverguide/mail-filtering.html\nIt has you install a number of packages:\namavisd-new, spamassassin, clamav-daemon, opendkim, postfix-policyd-spf-python, pyzor, razor\nThen, very simple directions are given (which is nice) for setting up ClamAV, SpamAssassin, and Amavisd-new. It is mentioned specifically that SpamAssassin will automatically detect and use pyzor and razor, and that no additional setup is needed for those.\nHowever, there is never any discussion as to how to setup SPF or DKIM, or whether they are automatically setup. Are these also automatically setup and integrated, like pyzor and razor? Or, is additional setup needed?\nThe Ubuntu Manpage discusses a setup for postfix-policyd-spf-python, as does an Ubuntu wiki page, but neither discusses anything about amavisd-new, spamassassin, or clamav-daemon, and whether or not SPF is automatically setup with those and the postfix-policyd-spf-python package, or whether the setup they detail must be done whether you are using it with those three package or not.\nhttp://manpages.ubuntu.com/manpages/precise/man1/policyd-spf.1.html\nCan anyone clarify this a bit?\nThank you.\n\nA: That guide is all about filtering spam out of your incoming mail. There's not really any setup required on your system apart from saying you'd like to check SPF and DKIM.\nIf you invoke that checking, then when your server gets an email from IP address 123.123.456.456 claiming to be from fred@example.com, it will look for a TXT record in the DNS entry for example.com to see if that IP address is listed as a valid source of mail for example.com\nDKIM just adds some more complexity on top of this \n", "Q: What is the license conditions to use Sublime text?

Two days ago I entered Windows 7 and updates were already downloaded. I am somewhat paranoid, and that bothers me.\nI am getting ready to dismantle MS, but until then, someone let me know.\n\nA: In such a case the answer is simple NO.\nWhen you start the computer and boot into an Operating System (OS) without using any sort of Virtual Machine (VM), there is no possible way that another OS could run simultaneously.\nThe CPU will be used by whatever OS you booted into, and no threads/process of another OS that is not running could be processed.\nI don't know what else could I say, it is just impossible.\n\nAbout the updates, Windows is very intrusive. You have to set several configurations to guarantee that no updates are download/installed. But that is not my field :)\n\nA: Lucio is right that Windows cannot run simultaneously with Ubuntu without the use of a VM.\nThe most likely scenario is that Windows downloaded the updates last time you ran it.\nWindows is much less flexible than Ubuntu (or any other Linux distro) and requires a restart for almost (?) every update. So when you started Windows again for the first time in a while, it was finally able to complete the installation of the updates that it had already retrieved.\nAnother possibility is that you have Windows configured to automatically download updates, but not to install them without your permission (assuming it prompted you before installing them). In that case 'already downloaded' could mean it happened between the time you booted Windows, and the moment it asked you to install the updates.\nIf the updates were small it could have happened very quickly.\n", "Q: Sublime Text 2 crashes on startup I installed sublime text 2 via apt-get as advised in the numerous answers in this question: How do I install Sublime Text 2/3?\nI used the following commands to install:\nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:webupd8team/sublime-text-2\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get install sublime-text\n\nWhen I start it (using terminal command 'sublime' or the UNITY dock icon, I get the following error:\nUnable to run package setup:\n\nTraceback (most recent call last):\nFile \"./PackageSetup.py\", line 165, in upgrade\nupgradePackage(pkg, pristinedir, datadir, backupdir)\nFile \"./PackageSetup.py\", line 158, in upgradePackage\nos.path.join(backupdir, base), inhibitOverwrite)\nFile \"./PackageSetup.py\", line 113, in upgradeArchive\nshutil.copy(src, dst)\nFile \".\\shutil.py\", line 88, in copy\nFile \".\\shutil.py\", line 53, in copyfile\nIOError: [Errno 13] Keine Berechtigung: u'/home/noel/.config/sublime-text-2/Pristine Packages/Text.sublime-package'\n\n\"Keine Berechtigung\" means \"no permission\", fyi. ;)\nBefore installing this via apt-get I had two failed installations (both times the program itself ran fine, but I couldn't save files.

It's already installed, anyway. You can mount it and then copy the files somewhere:\nsudo mount -o loop <image>.iso /<mountpoint>\n\nFor example, if you want mount it (so you can see all the files) in /home/Downloads/mountpoint, which is just a folder named \"mountpoint\" you created in your Downloads folder, you would paste the following, with a space at the end, into the terminal:\nsudo mount -o loop \n\nThen you would literall click and drag the .iso file from your file manager into the terminal window so the file's path appears. Then, after that and a space, you would type ~/Downloads/mountpoint so it looks rather like:\nsudo mount -o loop <the name of your image>.iso ~/Downloads/mountpoint\n\nThen you would go into that folder with the file manager and do what you need to do. Depending on what that is, you may want to copy the files over to another directory.\nWhen you have a filesystem such as a partition on a USB thumb drive or an .iso file (which can be used as a volume), you must mount it in order to get the OS to see the files.\n", "Q: `sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get upgrade` show no updates available for months on my computer When I try to update my computer, it says no updates are available.

Change default to be a hostname or a network address and slash annotated subnet to restrict it further (e.g. 10.4.0.0/16).

If the flash drive is using a USB 3.0 port, that will be faster, but a USB 2.0 port should work fine as well (USB 1.1 is going to be very slow by comparison).\nThere is a very detailed, step-by-step guide on help.ubuntu.com that thoroughly discusses the entire process and should be sufficient to be able to allow you to install from a USB Flash drive from various operating systems and in different scenarios. \nDo hope that is helpful as this is an easy process once you have the USB Flash drive setup.\n", "Q: Can I use source test1.sh with gnome-terminal -x?

Alternatively, define the variables with the export statement:\nexport a=1 b=2 c=3\n\nI presume you source test1.sh in an attempt to work around the export requirement (since a sourced file is interpreted by the sourcing shell, not executed in a subshell). What you are overlooking is that opening a gnome-terminal will start a new shell. \n\nA: Variables are not shared between separate shell instances. The only way I know of to access a variable from a script started in a different shell is to have the script write the variable to a file and then access that file.\nNow, in your special case, you can send the value of $a variable from main script to test script as follow:\nmain.sh:\n#/bin/sh\n\na=1\nb=2\nc=3\n\ngnome-terminal -x sh -c \"test1.sh '$a' | less\" # without source \".\"\n\n# ... some other code\n\ntest1.sh:\n#!/bin/sh\n\na=$1\n\necho \"a=$a\"\n\nor, use export as awets said in his answer.\n", "Q: Internal microphone is not working Basically I'm pretty new to Ubuntu and have tried a couple of solutions from this forum but no luck yet, I'm currently using Ubuntu 13.04 and I've tried to use the mic on Skype but it just won't work, it doesn't seem to work from the system settings either.\n\nA: I had a similar problem in Ubuntu 12.04, and tried this solution described \nin a youtube video:\n\n\n*\n\n*How to fix not working microphone in Ubuntu 13.04-10.04\nIt boils down to edit the file /etc/modprobe.d/alsa-base.conf using\nsudo gedit /etc/modprobe.d/alsa-base.conf\n\nand add the following line:\noptions snd-hda-intel position_fix=1\n\nMy mic is now working, but I hear some minor cracks.\n", "Q: Ubuntu can't see my second Hard Disk I am a new Ubuntu (and Linux) user, this is my first attempt.

I have read the other topics a bit similar to this but found that most have a different case and the closest case to mine was an issue with Ubuntu 13.04\nSorry for the long post.\n\nA: I will answer my own questions since this turned out to be a very basic thing and this may help Linux noobs like myself. Since I am completely illiterate when it comes to Linux I thought that a Hard Disk can be shared between platforms such as Linux and Windows, using NTFS, which as I have seen can happen, but since I formatted my Sata drive using windows, Ubuntu was only able to see the space I had allocated for it in the installation. The solution would be to format it into ext3/4 and then the drive can be fully accessible by Ubuntu. If anyone wants to have a shared drive between both platforms here are some good discussions about this topic:\nWhat's the best way to share files between Linux and Windows 7... (SuperUser)\nFile system compatible with all OSes (Unix & Linux) \nIn short Ubuntu is suppose to be ok with NTFS although I have no idea how stable it would be cross-platfoming, but the drive should be formatted from within Ubuntu.

This is very computer specific and I assume you know how to do it because you probably had to do that for the install in the first place. Check the boot order in your bios, or look for the button to press during the initial stage of boot up to select a one time medium to boot off of and that should fix your problem.\nTo really wipe your hard drive you would have to still boot off of the cd, and use it as a live-cd (ie boot ubuntu from the cd, so it isn't caring about your hard drive at all) then do something like\n\nDRIVE=a #note there is no space between these when assigned\nPART=1\nSIZE=1024\ndd if=/dev/zero of=/dev/sd$DRIVE$PART bs=1M count=$SIZE\n\nhere $DRIVE needs to be something like a b or c depending on how many drives you have and which one you want to zero out, and $PART needs to be some number corresponding to the partition on that drive you would like to zero out. Replace the a and 1 with whatever you may desire. $SIZE needs to be the number of megabytes in your partition desired to be erased.\nShown here is one gig being zeroed out from drive a (the first drive) and the first partition (the 1 in this)\nAgain though, if you can't even boot off of the cd, then wiping your drive probably isn't the problem, and if you can then you could just as easily re install ubuntu from the cd...

I believe I installed the dotnet40 or dotnet45 library during the installation (I definitely installed one of them, if not dotnet45 then I installed it afterwards by going into Settings > Install Components). It should theoretically work with simply dotnet40 but I did not one of the required libraries to be specifically that. I also tried installing mono but noticed something in the logs of it getting removed or something, though it is still installed on my system according to pacman (the default Arch Linux package manager), so I do not believe it is needed. But something that is needed for sure is to configure Wine so that the Windows version is set to \"Windows 7\". It was set to Windows 3.1 by default I think.\nThe colors are a little messed up.

I would like to know why the directory sizes I get when I execute du -sh disagree from the ones the file manager shows. What do they do differently and how big is my data really? I am not so much interested in the size it takes on the disk (because of blocks and stuff), I just want to know how big the actual data is.\n\nA: Short answer: The file manager calculates with units based on 1000, du calculates per default with units based on 1024. Because of this, the file manager views a file of 1024 bytes as \"1.024 kB\", while du views it as \"1.000 kiB\". This (literally) multiplies if you think of larger files, for example Megabyte (1000 * 1000) vs. Mibibyte (1024 * 1024) or Gigabyte (1000 * 1000 * 1000) vs. Gibibyte (1024 * 1024 * 1024). \nLong answer: The difference stems from the different ways computers and humans count. Most current human societies do their math with the decimal system, on the base of 10. Not all cultures in history did, that's why, for example, we divide the day into 24 hours. But with most things, we use 10, or multiples of 10, or 10 to the n-th power. This is evident in the International system of Units (SI), which uses prefixes to mark 10 ^ 3 = 1000. 1000 gram equals 1 *kilo*gram, the 1000th part of 1 meter equals 1 *milli*meter and so fort. Technical, 1000 kilogram would be 1 \"megagram\", but traditionally, we use a different word for it, \"ton\". Still, it is based on 1000.\nOn the other hand, computers calculate not based on 10, but based on 2 - on/off, power/no power, true/false. Therefore, computers use multiplies and powers of 2 instead of multiplies of 10: 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64 and so fort. The power of 2 which is nearest to 1000 is 1024. Because of this, \"1 kilobyte\" was defined originally not as \"1000 byte\" as most other units would have been, but as \"1024 byte\". In the same way, \"1 megabyte\" originally was \"1024 * 1024 byte\", \"1 gigabyte\" originally was \"1024 * 1024 * 1024 byte\" and so forth. \n\"Back then\", most people who used computers knew about this, and in the order of scales that were used in those days, it didn't make munch of a difference. Whether a file is 1000 bytes \"large\" or 1024 bytes, doesn't really matter in most cases. But time went on, computers became omnipresent, and the numbers became larger. Today, many computer users don't know about 1000 vs. 1024, or they don't care. It doesn't make too much sense to explain to \"Joe Everbody\", that with almost everything, \"kilo\" means \"1000 of it\", but with computers, it's different. Additionally, the difference starts to get significant. If you compare a \"Gigabyte\" based on 1000 to a \"Gigabyte\" based on 1024, the difference is roughly 10%. With \"Terabyte\" and larger, the difference is an even larger fraction.\nTherefore, over the last years many countries decided to differentiate between those two calculation systems. The classical prefixes kilo-, mega-, giga-, tera- etc. are today almost always used based on 1000. So, a file with 1024 bytes would no longer be \"1.000 kilobyte\", but \"1.024 kilobyte\". The units based on 1024 got new prefixes, with the first syllable of the \"old one\" followed by \"bi\": Kilo -> kibi, mega -> mibi, tera -> tebi and so forth. The symbols are KiB, MiB, TiB and so forth.\nNautilus, Ubuntu's file manager, calculates based on 1000. So it shows your file sizes in kilobytes, megabytes etc. du on the other hand still calculates based on 1024. So with du you see your file sizes in kibibytes, mebibytes etc. And as said above, once we are in the tera- vs. tebi- range and up, it starts to show ;) \ndu offers the --si switch. It works like -h, but calculates with SI units instead of based on 1024. So \ndu --si -s my_files/\n\nwould give you a size in KB, MB, GB etc., while\ndu -sh my_files/\n\nwould give you a size in KiB, MiB, GiB etc.\n\nA: The right way to find out the right disk space usage is using du command (du -sh). That's because your file manager (like Nautilus) doesn't take into account hidden files.\nOr you can use the Disk Usage Analyzer. Use the following command to start it from terminal:\nbaobab\n\n\nSee also: How to find - Size of a directory & Free disk space.\n\nA: I guess you use Nautilus as the file manager: hidden files are not taken into account. That's a known bug since 2006.\n", "Q: Software downloader downloading dozens of mb (almost) every day Why does ubuntu's software updater download around 80 MB (almost) every day?

Pretty swift and no errors during install, but as soon as Ubuntu loads the sound board goes bonkers and starts issuing a compulsive beeping sound (kind of like Morse code); this is on full volume, after 5 minutes my head was cracking. I have tried to mute the sound, connect headphones and microphone, but nothing shuts the beeping off. In the Sound Settings menu there are two devices listed: the board and the headphones, with the later blinking to the rhythm of the beep.\nAny hints on how to tame this soundboard are welcome. Even just muting the sound would be an improvement. Thanks. \n\nA: This issue was solved by installing the 3.2 kernel package and then setting it as the default GRUB option.\n", "Q: WiFi not connecting on Ubuntu sir,\nearlier i am getting WiFi connection, now not connecting on Ubuntu but the same connect on windows 7. please help me to solve this problem.\nthank you\nsubin\n\nA: Network Manager often has trouble working with Broadcom.\nI like to use WICD because it is a simple and easy to use network manager. Its a very good alternative to network manager in Ubuntu and it seems to always work when Network Manager doesn't. To install it just open up the terminal.\nTo download and install WICD\nsudo apt-get install wicd-gtk \nAnd now you need to uninstall NetworkManager:\nsudo apt-get remove --purge network-manager-gnome network-manager \nNow you can find WICD in your menu Start WICD, find the network you want to use and enter the information needed, password, encryption, etcetera and choose Automatically Connect to this network. You should be good to go!\nWICD may also be available in Ubuntu Update Manager so you can look there first but it is important to uninstall Network Manager completely to prevent conflicts!!\n", "Q: All program windows are grey after updating 13.04 I'm running the latest version of Ubuntu 13.04 and have just installed all updates - now when I log in I get grey windows when I open an application.

I have a HP DL380 G7 Server with the HW Raid configured at Raid 1+0. Previously, I have 146GB LFF SAS Installed but I since have upgraded to 600GB LFF SAS Drives.\nSince the Mirror Rebuilding was based on the 146GB Image, I have around 450GB of unused space which I want to integrate to the / filesystem.\nI am using this box as a web server. It is running a PHP Web Application with its DB as MySQL. I want to maximize the space for MySQL to use since this Web Application is doing thousands of transactions per day.\nHow do I change the volume size of the / filesystem without reinstalling?\nAre there any other suggestions to better maximize my system's resources?\nIf needed, here are my specs.\nOperating system    Ubuntu Linux 12.04.3\nKernel and CPU Linux 3.8.0-31-generic on x86_64\nProcessor information   Intel(R) Xeon(R) CPU E5630 @ 2.53GHz, 16 cores\nReal memory 418.78 MB used, 23.54 GB total\nBox HP ProLiant DL380 G7\n\nA: First you will need to configure the hardware raid to increase the size of the virtual disk.  If you have already done that, then you need to expand the partition, then tell the filesystem to use the new space.\nExpanding the partition can be done using parted.  Use the unit s command to have it use sectors as the units and print the existing table.  Then delete the existing partition with the rm command, and recreate it with the mkpart command.  Be sure to use the exact same starting sector, and make the length longer.  You may need to reboot for this to take effect.\nThen use the resize2fs command ( assuming you are using the ext4 filesystem ) to expand the filesystem into the new space.\n\nA: Since I am using an HP Server and an HP RAID Controller, I just reconfigured the current RAID Setup to reflect the HDD Size. After that, I used the HPACUCLI package to expand the partition.\n", "Q: How can I share my clipboard between two X servers? I've recently set up my Ubuntu machine so that I run another X session in pty8.  I mostly run virtual machines or remote desktop sessions on this other X server, which helps mediate some of the frustrations that can happen with keyboard integration in these environments.\nHowever, now if I copy something from some window on :0, I can't paste it into some window on :1.\nIs there a way I can share the clipboard between these two sessions?\n\nA: I came up with a solution that seems to work pretty well.  I'm not sure if there's a better way, but I wrote a script that starts my VM and then monitors the clipboard on display :0 for changes.  When a change is detected, it copies the clipboard contents to display :1.  It does this bidirectionally, so I can copy and paste from the VM just fine too.\nHere's the script:\n#!/bin/bash\n\nvirtualbox --startvm \"Windows 7\" --fullscreen &\nwaitpid=$!\n\nwatch_clip() {\n  local curr=\"\" prev=\"\" from=$1 to=:0\n\n  # On first run, we need to copy from :0 to :1 but not vice versa\n  if [[ \"$from\" == \":0\" ]]; then\n    xclip -o -selection clipboard -d :0 2> /dev/null | xclip -selection clipboard -d :1\n    to=:1\n  fi\n\n  while true; do\n    # Get the current clipboard contents\n    curr=`xclip -o -selection clipboard -d $from 2> /dev/null`\n\n    # Compare to previous results and copy if it's changed\n    if [[ \"$curr\" != \"$prev\" ]]; then\n      echo \"$curr\" | xclip -selection clipboard -d $to\n    fi\n\n    prev=\"$curr\"   \n    sleep 0.5\n  done\n}\n\nwatch_clip :0 &\nwatch_clip :1 &\nwait $waitpid\n\nThen all that's needed is the command to start the second X session:\nstartx ./.startwin7 -- :1\n\nI haven't noticed any issues, but if anyone can think of a better way I'd definitely appreciate the input.\n\nA: If you want something turnkey, Synergy should do the trick. I've never used it on just one box, across X sessions. It works to share clipboards between separate machines, so it would be surprising if a design flaw or usability issue kept it from working for you. \nAlso: for your vms, they have builds for Mac and Windows.\n\nA: I had the same problem.  Synergy didn't work well for me (it has major bugs in the X11 part of its clipboard syncing), and I didn't want to have a script that just polls the clipboard with a time delay, as that wastes CPU and/or adds random delays before I can paste.  I wrote a script called xclipsync that solves the problem for me.\nhttps://github.com/apenwarr/xclipsync\n", "Q: 0 upgraded, 0 newly installed, 0 to remove and 428 not upgraded When I want to install libqtcore4 or libqtgui4 or even libqt4-xml I got this text\nmaryam@maryam-MM061:~$ sudo apt-get install libqtcore4\n[sudo] password for maryam: \nReading package lists...

Open the update manage with update-manager or type sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get dist-upgrade to upgrade your system. dist-upgrade installs new kernels and such it does not install a newer release of Ubuntu. \n\nA: That means you already have the software/package installed on your computer.\n", "Q: Is there deb packages that display license agreement? Could you please list some deb packages that show license agreement and ask to accept it?\nI would like to learn their internals.\n\nA: If I remember correctly, the msttcorefonts package asks to accept an EULA.\n\nA: If you intend to sell commercial software through the software center, I think they provide a mechanism for license presentation and acceptance (although someone familiar with the process might be able to correct me there).\nOtherwise, if you intend to distribute something on a free software basis, clickwrap licenses are a Bad Idea. For instance, they make it difficult to install the package in an automated fashion (how can the license be accepted then?), and (as far as I know) it remains unclear whether a clickwrap license in practice carries any more force than one just included in the package. Any sort of restrictive license is also likely to reduce the dissemination of your software, as any uncertainty about rights will lead to distributions and mirrors not carrying it, or relegating it to secondary or non-default package collections.\nThe Debian Free Software Guidelines (FAQ) are the guidelines which the Debian project follows for accepting software into their archive. It should be noted that Ubuntu, while Debian-derived, follows a generally more-flexible policy on software freedom than Debian.\n\nA: You can find the documentation for copyright files in deb packages here: Machine-readable debian/copyright file\nAs far as I am concerned, this is from 2012, so a very young development. Not much packages include a machine readable licence by now, and I am not sure how apt managers handle it.\nGet more info about this issue on Stackoverflow: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/1884753/license-info-of-a-deb-package\nMy personal intention says, most \"Accept Licence\" Dialogs are made by the vendors themselfs.\nP.S: That a licence needs to be accepted by the user to be valid or that an accepted licence is automatically valid is a misunderstanding. You need to inform the user about the licence, but that does not necessarily mean that you need a Dialog with \"Accept\" - \"Decline\".\n\nA: No software in Ubuntu or Debian proper (that is, free software) ought to ask the user to accept any license on install. But there are debs of non-free packages as well, some of which do so. Another poster mentioned msttcorefonts; some others (if I remember right) are flashplugin-nonfree and sun-java6-jdk (recently removed from Debian and Ubuntu due to license changes).\nThe larger answer that you probably want, though, is that the Right Way to do this is by using Debconf.\n", "Q: Interacting with appindicator icon and menus from LDTP I'm using LDTP Python API in order to test desktop applications under Ubuntu (Unity shell, Ubuntu 12.04).

Can anyone suggest a solution?\n\nA: Yes, desktop applications are wonderfully tested with autopilot. It was originally written to test unity, unity indicators, and etc.\nWhat is autopilot?\nAutopilot is a functional testing tool. It simulates user actions by generating keyboard and mouse events, and then testing the internal state of the application in question.

Basically, I would like use git to:\n1) Automatically save every revision of every file on disk or in given folder, but limited to certain extensions (.html, .tex, .txt, .doc, .odt etc.)\n2) Easily browse previous versions and restore them. Ideally, I would be able to choose destination folder for keeping revisions\nCreating a new Git project for each file is not very good idea, so I am looking for something simpler that will just re-create folders structure with an option to restore previous versions.\n\nA: How about using SparkleShare?\nSparkleShare is intended for synchronizing projects between multiple contributors automatically using Git. You can use it basically as a tool for automatically saving changes to files it a version controlled Git repository, and don't need to use its multiple contributor features.\nIt will connect to various services, including BitBucket:\n\nHere you can see the history it presents of a folder:\n\nSparkleShare only saves changes and keeps a list of the changes. There is no way (that I know of) to use it to view a file at a particular commit. Clicking on the file in the Recent Changes dialog just opens the newest version.\nSo, you can use a Git client, such as Giggle  to view changes at particular commits:\n\nHowever, Giggle will not let you view the actual file at a particular commit, instead forcing you to view changes. So, you might want to use a different client such as gitg :\n\n(The black everywhere is a bug because I'm using the GNOME 3.8 PPA.)\nYou can install SparkleShare by clicking on this button:\n\nOr, you can use this command in a terminal:\nsudo apt-get install sparkleshare\n\n\nA: If you're looking for an advanced backup tool, I'd recommend Back In Time .\n\nYou can configure it in many, many ways, but here is how I use it:\n\n\n*\n\n*Take a snapshot every hour\n\n*Keep hourly snapshots for the past 24 hours\n\n*Keep daily snapshots for the past 7 days\n\n*Keep weekly snapshots for the past 4 weeks\n\n*Keep monthly snapshots for the last 24 months\n\n\nA: If you use Linux, you can try Btrfs file system, it has wonderful backup functionalities.\nIf you move to FreeBSD or OpenIndiana you can use XFS. \n", "Q: Alsamixer is out to get me?

Is puppet capable of automation of this kind?\nThanks!\n\nA: You probably could do but before I get to that, consider the traditional approach:\n\n\n*\n\n*Wait for out-of-hours. Few servers need to be active 24/7 and those that do usually have a failover system that allows you to upgrade one server at a time without any downtime. If it's not important enough to have an hour of planned downtime, you can schedule an upgrade.\n\n*Make a disk backup onto your second disk. But you already make these regularly, right?\n\n*Do your standard LTS-to-LTS upgrade. Fix anything that's broken and move on. The services on the server will remain active as long as they can (MySQL et al will restart themselves on upgrades but they usually come straight back up).\n\nThe only way to do what you're asking is with a virtual machine. You could try lightweight LXC or schroot methods but I think you'll probably want to go for VirtualBox if only because it's old and documented.\nInstall it, create a VM with near-physical, raw access to the disk, install Ubuntu and get everything set up. I will grant you, this gives you a lot of flexibility for getting things reconfigured if you need to change anything in the upgrade.\n\nThe other and only true high-availability approach is the hot-replacement/failover approach. Start a brand new server, install Ubuntu, get it configured, sync the data (ideally sharing it from a SAN over NFS between all servers so there's some atomic consistency) and get it up and running. Flick the switch and in a new microseconds, the new server takes the place of the old one.\nA more modern approach to this is to just virtualise on all your metal so that even if you only have one physical host server, you could just create another VM for your new server and do a simple soft switch.\n\nI think the first, traditional method gives you the most security without complicating an existing production setup with things like virtual machines (assuming they're not in place already).\n", "Q: Steam opens update box and closes When I try to open steam with terminal it says this\nubuntu@ubuntu-linux:~$ steam\nRunning Steam on ubuntu 12.04 32-bit\nSTEAM_RUNTIME is enabled automatically\nInstalling breakpad exception handler for appid(steam)/version(1379786203_client)\nInstalling breakpad exception handler for appid(steam)/version(1379786203_client)\nunlinked 0 orphaned pipes\nremoving stale semaphore last operated on by process 8967 with name 0eBlobRegistryMutex_01ADCAAE08B43E5E8AE44675F4157195\nremoving stale semaphore last operated on by process 8967 with name 0eBlobRegistrySignal_01ADCAAE08B43E5E8AE44675F4157195\nremoving stale semaphore last operated on by process 9024 with name 0emSteamEngineInstance\nremoving stale semaphore last operated on by process 9024 with name 0eSteamEngineLock\nGtk-Message: Failed to load module \"gail\"\nGtk-Message: Failed to load module \"atk-bridge\"\nInstalling breakpad exception handler for appid(steam)/version(1379786203_client)\n[1002/173410:WARNING:proxy_service.cc(958)] PAC support disabled because there is no system implementation\nInstalling breakpad exception handler for appid(steam)/version(1379786203_client)\nInstalling breakpad exception handler for appid(steam)/version(1379786203_client)\nInstalling breakpad exception handler for appid(steam)/version(1379786203_client)\nInstalling breakpad exception handler for appid(steam)/version(1379786203_client)\nSteam: An X Error occurred\nX Error of failed request:  BadValue (integer parameter out of range for operation)\nMajor opcode of failed request:  18 (X_ChangeProperty)\nValue in failed request:  0x0\nSerial number of failed request:  105\nxerror_handler: X failed, continuing\nUploading dump (out-of-process) [proxy '']\n/tmp/dumps/crash_20131002173407_1.dmp\n/home/ubuntu/.local/share/Steam/steam.sh: line 704:  9373 Segmentation fault      (core dumped) $STEAM_DEBUGGER \"$STEAMROOT/$PLATFORM/$STEAMEXE\" \"$@\"\nFinished uploading minidump (out-of-process): success = yes\nresponse: CrashID=bp-861c8f22-4970-4dab-90b5-c79ad2131002\n\nwhat do I do?

From the looks of it, you used an Ubuntu package, when you install it asks you for the \"URL for the Moodle site\", which defaults to http://localhost/moodle.

But here's the issue I keep running into, 2 of the 3 computers can see each other since they have samba, yet they cannot see the third computer. And the third computer cannot see them. All of the computers have Samba, and are all on the same hub. I've been trying to troubleshoot it, but it seems a little harder than windows to fix. The OS I've been running on the computers is 2 of them have Ubuntu 12.10 and one has 12.04. One of the 12.10 and the 12.04 can see each other but the other 12.10 cannot see either one. Can anybody help?\n\nA: It is difficult to tell from the information you posted. It could be anything from a firewall issue to misconfigured samba shares.\nI suggest you start by turning your firewall off on all 3 computers.\nThen if the shares do not show, debug your network using ping.\nIf ping is working, then manually mount the shares on the command line and post any error message.\nsmbclient -L //server -U user\n\nsudo mount -t cifs //myserver_ip_address/myshare ~/mnt -o username=samb_user,noexec\n\nYou have to change \"server\" to your server name or ip address, \"user\" to your actual user on the server, \"myshare\" to the actual share name, etc.\nFor details see\nUbuntu shares not visible on the network\nHow to turn on Network Discovery and Share between computers with Samba\nhttps://help.ubuntu.com/community/Samba/SambaClientGuide\n\nA: The first thing I would do is get the IP address of each machine. Ping the machine that is not showing up to make sure it is on the network. Samba uses UDP ports 137, 138 and TCP ports 139, 445. The default firewall for Ubuntu is ufw. Hopefully all you need to do is configure firewall rules (using ufw) to allow those ports to be used. \n\nA: First, ensure your 12.10 computers don't have the same host name. Then, test for basic connectivity, and work your way up to accessing the samba share. Can you ping from the problem machine to the other machines and vice versa? Once you have verified ping works, I would try running a network port scan against the problem machine from one of the other machines with nmap. On one of the other non-problem machines, hit ctrl+alt+t for the terminal, then type sudo apt-get install nmap ,hit enter and authenticate to install nmap. With the command nmap , you can run a port scan against one of the other machine's IP addresses to see if the samba ports(i.e., 139, 445) are open. I would compare the port scan of a working machine to the non-working machine to ensure they are the same. If the appropriate ports are not showing as open, check for the status of Ubuntu Firewall on the problem machine with sudo ufw status, and make changes to your firewall as necessary. I don't think UFW is installed on 12.10 by default, anyway, but it's worth checking the status to see. After that, I suggest following the tips at the article below to get your samba setup correctly on the problem machine.\nhttp://www.unixmen.com/howto-install-and-configure-samba-share-in-ubuntu/ \n\nA: The way Windows shares files and printers is called SMB. The people from the SAMBA project have implemented all of Microsoft's protocols and specifications for Linux. Ubuntu therefore supports the same sort of file sharing as Windows, which is called Samba.\nYou can use SAMBA to share files between Linux machines. In fact, you might prefer it in case you have, for example, have a friend over with their Windows computer.\nAlternatively, you can use The Linux Way of sharing files, which is NFS (Network File System) - This answer to a previous question explains how to do it. (but it's rather technical)\nSo, when the Sharing Options dialogue asks you to install the packages, you're not actually installing any Microsoft software or anything like that. Go ahead and do it, it's perfectly safe.\n", "Q: Getting ia32-libs-gtk I am testing Ubuntu 13.04 ARM on my Android phone.

You don't \"create a new session in Byobu\". Byobu is \"only\" a shell for a terminal multiplexer. As this terminal multiplexer as the backend to Byobu, you can choose between screen and tmux. You might say, running Byobu is more or less are way to run screen or tmux with added features.\nCommands that you pass to byobu are passed to your backend. new -s <sessionname> seems to be a syntax that tmux understands, but not screen. It looks like you've configured Byobu to use screen as backend per default. You can choose the backend you want by calling byobu-screen or byobu-tmux, respectively, instead of simply byobu. Alternatively you can change your default backend with the tool byobu-select-backend.\nSo you've got two possibilities: Look up the syntax needed to have screen start a new session, or use tmux as your backend for Byobu as described above.\n", "Q: Lubuntu: How to add Thunderbird as system startup application?

But same problem. again in the live-session.\nEDIT: During both the installation, I removed the usb just after restarting.If it has something to do with, please let me know.\n\nA: The third Wubi option is to help you boot the DVD/USB. This is e.g. if you don't have the ability to override your BIOS boot options. Most modern computers can do this with e.g. pressing F12 when the computer starts, or F2 to enter BIOS and modify the boot device order.\nBut in any case, when you use Wubi in this way, it's the same as booting the live environment. \nOnce you see the Ubuntu Desktop there will be an icon (top left on the Unity launcher) that is Install Ubuntu. If you click that you can install a normal dual boot. Note this is not a Wubi install, but a normal install that partitions your hard drive and installs the Grub bootloader to the drive MBR. If you don't install, then no changes are made. i.e. if you boot to the live environment and then shut down, nothing changes. The Windows boot manager entry is still there, but Ubuntu hasn't been installed, either with Wubi or normally. You still need that USB to boot.\nThe Wubi boot helper as it's called, added an entry in the Windows Boot Manager. This remains until you go to the Control Panel, Add or remove programs, and double click on Ubuntu to uninstall it.\nPS. The Wubi boot helper is seldom used, tested, and poorly documented. I've used it with a CD a while ago, but not a USB. There may be some inaccuracies in the above, but most of it should be correct.\n", "Q: How do I get involved in Ubuntu?

Let's take for example sdb2 - it was the last one plugged. It's UUID is 8AD65635D65621AD - keep this in mind.\nFirst, make a group called let say my_device (you can call it whatever else) and add your accounts to it. You will do these from terminal:\nsudo groupadd my_device\nsudo usermod -a -G my_device your_username\nsudo usermod -a -G my_device another_username\n#...\nsudo usermod -a -G my_device last_username\n\nSecond, make a new folder called my_device in /media and give everyone in the my_device group permission to read and write it:\nsudo mkdir /media/my_device\nsudo chown :my_device /media/my_device\nsudo chmod 660 /media/my_device\n\nFinally, open fstab as root. Something like:\nsudo -i gedit /etc/fstab\n\nand add this line at the end:\nUUID=8AD65635D65621AD    /media/my_device    vfat    users,noauto,relatime    0  0\n\nSave the file and close it.

It works fine from the command line.  I've struggled with getting it to work properly from cron.\nThis is my current (edited) crontab:\nMAILTO=myid@myhost.com\nBASH_ENV=$HOME/.bashrc\n0,5,10,15,20,25,30,35,40,45,50,55 * * * *   . $HOME/.bashrc;$HOME/bin/monitorDataSourceStatus.groovy >> $HOME/mDSS.out 2>&1\n\nI don't think the Ubuntu cron uses the \"BASH_ENV\" variable, but I saw that mentioned in other \"cron\" references, so I thought I'd try it.  The MAILTO is also likely ignored, as I don't have an MTA installed.\nI know the basic operation of cron is ok, because I get a syslog entry every five minutes as this specifies.  The last one looks like this:\nOct  2 09:30:01 hostname CRON[20268]: (myid) CMD (. $HOME/.bashrc;$HOME/bin/monitorDataSourceStatus.groovy >> $HOME/mDSS.out 2>&1)\nOct  2 09:30:01 hostname CRON[20267]: (CRON) info (No MTA installed, discarding output)\nOct  2 09:30:10 hostname crontab[20275]: (myid) LIST (myid)\n\nHowever, I can tell from expected side effects that it doesn't seem like the script is executing.  I've enabled some print statements in the script, but the \"mDSS.out\" file hasn't been modified for several days now.\nI don't know if it's practical to install a MTA.  I assume that's Mail Transfer Agent.\n\nA: The MTA message is because your script is producing output which cron normally sends an email for. \nReplace your cron job with this:\nMAILTO=myid@myhost.com\nBASH_ENV=$HOME/.bashrc\n0,5,10,15,20,25,30,35,40,45,50,55 * * * *   . $HOME/.bashrc;$HOME/bin/monitorDataSourceStatus.groovy > $HOME/mDSS.out 2>&1\n\nYou'll need to install an MTA like sendmail in order to get cron messages.

The USB interface is not even as fast as PATA, much less a 5400 rpm SATA drive.\nTertius, the USB drive is more fragile, both physically and electronically. Flash memory will fail, and experience shows it fails quicker than the hypothetical specification.\nQuartius, as with SSD drives, heavy use leads to failure earlier.  If you have adequate RAM in the PC, that's preferred for external Flash use. \nAll that being said, it should work well, until it fails, if it works at all. And, to be on point, here are explicit answers to the four questions you raised in your original post:\n1: YES\n2: YES\n3: SEE ABOVE\n4: ALL FEATURES WILL WORK IF YOU CREATE THE FLASH DRIVE WITH PERSISTANCE (which reserves R/W space so you can save files to it). As to how long it lasts until it fails, I don't have a good guess, but I have a booting USB flash drive which has been in twice-weekly use for 5 years, and it wasn't spendy, just a plastic-case 4GB run-of-the-mill flash drive.\nAnd, a 16GB flash drive is more than adequate.\n\nA: Yes, you can do a full install of Ubuntu to your flash drive and there is no difference whatsoever between it and a hard drive installation. As for features there will also be no difference. Ubuntu is an operating system and it does not matter if it is on a flash or hard drive, it still operates the same way. Think of your flash drive as just being another hard drive attached to your computer.\nI have ubuntu working for me on a flash drive. Here is how I did it.\nI have Ubuntu installed on 64GB Sandisk flash drive. It is a persistent (as Ubuntu terms it) or permanent install. I can take it anywhere and plug it into any computer or laptop and be running my on desktop with all my files, emails, work, everything right there ready to go. To do this I burned Ubuntu to a DVD. Then I plugged in my flash drive and booted up to the DVD. I started the install and pointed it to my flash drive. I created the following partitions. 1. a boot partition /boot and gave it 250mb of space I choose ext4 for the format 2. a root partition /root and gave it 12000mb space and ext4 format 3. a swap partition /swap and gave it 4096mb of space (it will format to swap) 4 a home partition /home and gave it the rest of the space and formatted it to ext4.\nThen I just finished the install and it runs beautifully, very stable, no problems. Note: I gave 4096mb to the swap but I have never seen Ubuntu use more than 1 1/2gb of swap and that was only for a second. I just allocated 4gb of swap in case...you never know but you probably will never need it and you can easily use 2048mb (2gb) swap with no troubles ever. I have 16gb ram in my computer. You will not have to worry about ntfs or whatever as windows reads all of my drive easily and vice versa.\nAnother thing I should mention is that you cam plug your ubuntu drive into any computer anywhere in the world and it will boot up and operate which is something Windows cannot do.\n", "Q: Find files where the filename is only different by case I need to get a list of all the files that only differ in case.\nI.e., if I have a folder (with sub-folders) with the files:\none.txt\nONE.txt\ntwo.txt\nthree.txt\nthree.TXT\nfour.txt\nfive/5.txt\nfive/6.txt\nfive/6.Txt\n\nI want some bash magic that will spit out:\none.txt\nONE.txt\nthree.txt\nthree.TXT\nfive/6.txt\nfive/6.Txt\n\n\nA: ls -R | uniq -Di\n\nshould do it for you, supposing your locale sorts upper and lower case letters together.

Ctrl+O, then Enter and finally Ctrl+X.\n2) Finally refresh the udev rules with:\n\n\n*\n\n*sudo udevadm trigger\nNOTE: With the ENV{UDISKS_IGNORE}=\"1\" it will ignore the disk for Ubuntu 12.10 & 13.04.\nFor Ubuntu 12.04 the variable would be ENV{UDISKS_PRESENTATION_HIDE}=\"1\".\nHope this helps.\n\nA: Two solutions here: one is fast to apply, although solves the problem only partially, the other one is the complete one but requires you to compile your own kernel.\nThe correct answer is a kernel patch.\nRobin H. Johnson wrote a patch for the SATA kernel driver (find it in Unix/Linux stack exchange site) which hides completely the drive.\nUpdate 1 The patch is now upstream (at least in 3.12.7 stable kernel), see  the git repository. I asked for backport in the Ubuntu launchpad.\nUpdate 2 The patch is in the standard kernel for Ubuntu Trusty Thar 14.04; so now only the following addition to boot parameter is needed.\nOnce the patch is installed, adding\n libata.force=2.00:disable\n\nto the kernel boot parameters will hide the disk from the Linux kernel. Double check that the number is correct; searching for the device name can help:\n(0)samsung-romano:~% dmesg | grep iSSD\n[    1.493279] ata2.00: ATA-8: SanDisk iSSD P4 8GB, SSD 9.14, max UDMA/133\n[    1.494236] scsi 1:0:0:0: Direct-Access     ATA      SanDisk iSSD P4  SSD  PQ: 0 ANSI: 5\n\nTo add a kernel parameter (bot temporarily and permanently) you can check this Q&A: How do I add a kernel boot parameter?\nWorkaround\nAt least the problem of enabling suspend-resume has been solved by by Unix StackExchange user Emmanuel in https://unix.stackexchange.com/a/103742/52205.

All of the data and files are on a standard HDD.  The system's other user accounts each have a directory on the HDD.  Unfortunately, I don't know how to grant users access to their partitions.  I have created symbolic links from their home directories, on the SSD, to their directories on the HDD.  However, the permissions must be messed up since they can't see the contents of their directories.\nI did try to use chown to set the permissions.  So for a user named john I did the following to their data directory (on the HDD): sudo chown john:john -R /media/myusername/HDD/John\nThis doesn't grant them access, unfortunately.  Should I be mounting the HDD to /media/ instead of its automount location, which is /media/myusername?\nTo be clear, I want users to have access to their own directories on the HDD, but not anyone else's.  Otherwise, I would just change the entire disk's permissions to 777.\nThanks.\n\nA: You can mount the drive in /mnt or /media so all users can get to it. Then chown each of their directories to be owned by them and their group. To keep everyone else out chmod 770. And in your example I would drop the -R Just give the main directory no permissions for the world and no one but the user will be able to get in.\nEX:\nuser john has folder in top level of drive called john and the drive is mounted at /mnt/drive\nsudo chown john:john /mnt/drive/john\nsudo chmod 770 /mnt/drive/john\n", "Q: Upstart and process substitution So I want to use the following in my script stanza:\nforever -l >(tee $QW_LOG_DIR/webserver.log | logger -p user.info -t '[QW]') start webserver.js\n\nHowever, that won't work because:\n\n*\n\n*That's bash syntax, and:\n\n\n*The >(...) construct creates a process before my actually creating forever, so upstart will track the wrong pid.\n... at least that's what I think, I'm an upstart newbie.\nMy thinking is that in order to bypass both of these issues, I should use mkfifo in my pre-start stanza so that I can write to the fifo in my start script.\nQuestions:\n\n*\n\n*Is that the way to go?

Drupal and wordpress sites (which might be important, I'm not sure).\nI am testing it out by running some sendmail commands and it is actually sending me the mail. The domain (@whatever.com) is what I specified in the config process.\nIs there a way to have the domain change depending on what Virtualhost (site) is sending the mail? So if myweb.org send mail it comes from @myweb.org.\n\nA: The sender of an email is not set by Postfix. It is set by the mail agent, which specifies it in the From header. (There are some additional technicalities related to the Sender of the envelope, but these are probably not relevant.) \nWhen you were testing your setup using the sendmail command, you weren't setting the From header, but left it to Postfix to complete the sender address. That's when it uses the mailhost value or some other mechanism to add a domain name to the unqualified system user name.\nVirtual hosts won't normally send mail as an unqualified system user. In Drupal or Wordpress you configure a fully qualified sender address to be used when the system sends email.\n(Obviously, if you are also hosting incoming mail for the hosted domains, then your Postfix will need a bunch of additional configuration, but your question suggests you're only concerned with outbound mail.)\n", "Q: `sudo userx` returns `sudo: userx: command not found` , why? just installed this Linux disto ver 13.04 installed Xfce 4.0x got it running just fine then for some reason that good'O sudo stopped working all by itself why?

However, that is no good for me since I have LVM encryption so it requires entering the passkey onsite and I can't do that via remote-in. On comparison of the hibernation and suspend routines I noticed that on suspend within\n/usr/lib/pm-utils/sleep.d/50unload_alx\n\nit has the line:\n\n'modunload alx'\n\nwhich I found is what is unloading the drivers for the atheros NIC. Commenting it out did the trick and the lights stayed on when I suspend and now I can WOL. \nHOWEVER, I discovered the reason for the modunload alx is due to a bug that prevents the machine from suspending properly, hence it was probably added in. \nSO, the new situation I am in now is that I am able to WOL from suspend but I can't suspend the machine after the first time. Interestingly enough, hibernation works fine and WOL from hibernation works every time. \nI just can't suspend and WOL and repeat over and over again. First suspend works with\nsudo pm-suspend\n\nbut after that, it does not anymore. \nHOWEVER, I found that I can suspend fine through the desktop (and then WOL), which I find strange....\nSo the new question is (perhaps I should create a new thread):\nWhat is the difference between \nsudo pm-suspend\n\nversus suspending through the desktop??\nAlso, if I do \nsudo pm-suspend-hybrid\n\nIt suspends and I can also WOL. If I set the timer on the desktop to suspend after XX minutes, it also suspends fine and I can WOL.\nSo what is the difference between all these routines versus what sudo pm-suspend does??\n", "Q: why am I being denied my rights in sudo? why am I being denid my rights to delete directories even I created in sudo now I cannot rid myself of it -- yes it is empty \ndid this to insure I have sudo in the accounts:\nuserz@bw:~$ sudo adduser userx sudo\n[sudo] password for userz: \nThe user `userx' is already a member of `sudo'.\nuserz@bw:~$ sudo adduser userz sudo\nThe user `userz' is already a member of `sudo'.\nuserz@bw:~$ cd /usr/local/share\n\nso then I tried to delete the directory:\nuserz@bw:/usr/local/share$ rmdir themes\nrmdir: failed to remove ‘themes’: Permission denied\n\nchecked to be sure it is empty:\nuserz@bw:/usr/local/share$ cd themes\nuserz@bw:/usr/local/share/themes$ ls\nuserz@bw:/usr/local/share/themes$ ls -la\ntotal 8\ndrwxr-xr-x 2 root root 4096 Oct  2 14:20 .\ndrwxr-xr-x 8 root root 4096 Oct  2 14:20 ..\nuserz@bw:/usr/local/share/themes$ \n\nif I am in sudo then why it not let me be super user dude to do what I will?\n\nA: Being a member of the sudo group just means that you are allowed to sudo into the root role.

I know there are a lot of questions about video encoders around here, but my question is more about workflow/efficiency.\nFor my day job, I need to convert videos, frequently, from many random formats (usually large AVI, M4V, and what not) and convert them and compress them down into efficient files we can use around the internet for uploading. Formats I must produce are:\n\n\n*\n\n*WMV (Windows Media Video 9)\n\n*MOV (H.264)\n\n*MP4 (H.264)\n\n\nI need to create common templates for a couple use cases (convert to same-as-source, 1080p, or 720p) and be able to process these quickly, and en queue.\nAny ideas on how to best go about this process in Ubuntu?\n\nA: If you prefer command-line you can use ffmpeg (or handbrake-cli).\nMP4\nAssuming you're using a recent version of ffmpeg:\nffmpeg -i input -c:v libx264 -crf 23 -preset medium -c:a aac -b:a 128k \\\n-movflags +faststart -vf scale=-2:720,format=yuv420p output.mp4\n\n\n*\n\n*-crf: Quality. Range is logarithmic 0 (lossless) to 51 (worst quality). Default is 23. Subjective sane range is ~18-28 or so. Use the highest value that still gives you an acceptable quality. If you are re-encoding impractically large inputs to upload to YouTube or similar then try a value of 17 or 18 since these video services will re-encode anyway.\n\n\n*-preset: Encoding speed. A slower preset provides better compression (quality per file size) but is slower. Use the slowest that you have patience for: ultrafast, superfast, veryfast, faster, fast, medium (the default), slow, slower, veryslow.\n\n\n*-movflags +faststart: Allows video to playback before it is completely downloaded in the case of progressive download viewing. Useful if you are hosting the video, otherwise superfluous if uploading to a video service like YouTube.\n\n\n*-vf scale=-2:720,format=yuv420p: A filtergraph using scale and format video filters. Scale to 720 pixels in height, and automatically choose width that will preserve aspect, and then make sure the pixel format is compatible with dumb players.\n\n\n*-b:a 128k: Audio bitrate. If your ffmpeg is outdated then you'll need to add -strict experimental to use -c:a aac.\nMOV\nSince your MOV and MP4 files probably contain the same video and audio formats you can encode the MP4 and make the MOV by re-muxing (with stream copy mode) instead of re-encoding:\nffmpeg -i input.mp4 -codec copy output.mov\n\nWMV\nFFmpeg only supports WMV 7 and 8. I am unaware of an open source encoder for version 9.\n$ ffmpeg -encoders | grep -i windows\n[...]\n V..... = Video\n A..... = Audio\n ------\n V..... wmv1                 Windows Media Video 7\n V..... wmv2                 Windows Media Video 8\n A..... wmav1                Windows Media Audio 1\n A..... wmav2                Windows Media Audio 2\n\nAs I am unfamiliar with these encoders I can only give an untested example:\nffmpeg -i input -c:v wmv2 -b:v 1024k -c:a wmav2 -b:a 192k output.wmv\n\nGetting ffmpeg\nYou can download a Linux build of ffmpeg or follow a step-by-step ffmpeg compilation guide to customize your build.\nUsing a bash \"for loop\" to perform a batch encode\nTo encode all videos in a directory:\n$ mkdir encoded\n$ for f in *.avi; do ffmpeg -i \"$f\" -c:v libx264 -crf 23 -preset medium \\\n  -c:a aac -b:a 128k -movflags +faststart -vf scale=-2:720,format=yuv420p \\\n  \"encoded/${f%.avi}.mp4\"; done\n\nAlso see\n\n*\n\n*Who can tell me the difference and relation between ffmpeg, libav, and avconv?\n\n*FFmpeg H.264 Video Encoding Guide\n\n*FFmpeg AAC Audio Encoding Guide\n\n*Using HandBrakeCLI\n\nA: Try HandBrake.  \nHandBrake is a tool for converting video from nearly any format to a selection of modern, widely supported codecs.

The problem: it is EXTREMELY laggy.   I ran it off my CDROM first to test the waters and it was laggy then too, but I assumed that was because I was running it from the CDROM.  Now it's fully installed but everything is laggy except the pointer (even typing). \n\nA: My guess is that your computer can't handle the Unity desktop environment and is trying to make up with software acceleration. Try installing the lubuntu-desktop package and selecting it before you log-in. If I recall correctly (I'm not at an Ubutntu PC right now), you will see a small Ubuntu logo by your user name. Click that and you should get a list of the different desktop environments installed. Select LXDE.

Is there an HTTPS version? Are repository updates secure?\nAs a bear of little brain from the developer side, I cannot understand why the repository list is http://security.ubuntu.com and the other http(unsecured) sites listed in /etc/apt/sources.list.  Without a certificate chain match this appears as \"ask any responder for a list of packages to update\" instead of \"ask the ubuntu.com site...\"\nCan any network choose to spoof the update sites, and is this a common practice to provide a locally cached and vetted copy?\n\nA: Update 2022:  Repository hosts/mirrors tend to support HTTPS now, so you may as well use it to give additional assurance on top of what APT provides.  Read below for an explanation of why HTTPS alone wouldn't be enough to protect you, and why APT adds its own cryptographic security.\n\nIn short, there is security without HTTPS, because all the packages are cryptographically signed and APT verifies the signatures.\nThe APT system is a secure packaging solution in which packages are signed with keys known only to Ubuntu and APT verifies the signatures against the package using public keys in APT's keyring on your system. This effectively provides end to end assurance that the package is unmodified by anyone outside of Ubuntu regardless of whether you obtained it from an official Ubuntu server or some mirror somewhere.\nUbuntu's repository system was built (as part of Debian) in a way so you don't have to trust the mirror you use, just that they didn't modify the package since it was signed internally by the distribution. This allows for the repository to be decentralized and for any volunteer to set up a mirror.\nSo, for example, you could use example.com as a mirror - if you were to use HTTPS and verify that you really are talking to example.com, it doesn't tell you anything useful, such as whether that mirror is approved by your distribution (Ubuntu) or whether that mirror modifies the packages after it gets them from Ubuntu to add viruses, it just tells you that you're talking to example.com. But APT's built in signature verification does provide those assurances.\nA technical explanation of how this works is available from Ubuntu (and from Debian which uses the same system).\nAPT does work over HTTPS and you can use HTTPS in an APT sources entry to apply another level of assurance to your connection (if the repository you're using supports it).  This can act as an additional safeguard on top of APT's, especially now that past concerns about additional overhead imposed by HTTPS connections are less relevant.\nArguments for using HTTPS:\nNot using HTTPS can be a privacy concern, because eavesdroppers could see what files you are downloading, though privacy has not historically been considered to be concern in this case as they are publicly available files, and APT's verification can still detect modification.  Nonetheless HTTPS could be used to make it harder for attackers to see what you are installing.\nAnother assurance that APT's signing mechanism doesn't provide is that the packages you are receiving are the latest available version.  As a mitigation to this, the signed release file includes a \"Valid-Until\" date field after which the files it references should be considered out of date.  It would be plausible for a man-in-the-middle or nefarious mirror to substitute an archive with an unmodified earlier version of the archive within this Valid-Until date and delay an update to a package for this time window.  But they can't make any arbitrary modifications to packages nor could they go back in time past that point.\nAnother reason you may consider using HTTPS is to guard against flaws in APT's own signing and verification.  Flaws in this have been discovered, and fixed, in the past.\n\nA: Important supplement：in fact, as upgrade and initial installation download online, it takes a lot of traffic, and the source of these traffic, that is, binary and text code streams, is reproducible. So there are a large number of gateways and cache devices on the Internet for it. A considerable number of ISPs had set up cache based on the http protocol in order to save the export bandwidth, and the https protocol cannot exist as a transparent cache.\nAnother reason is that the http-based mirroring program is much simpler, there is no need to verify the tls-ssl certificate, and no need to worry about certificate invalidation or web server configuration problems too.\nNot too long ago, about 20 years, at beginning of Internet, https and Internet traffic were still very expensive gameplays. Therefore, http also included the ftp protocol, which is close to being obsolete, as the main way of delivering installation and update for software packages distribution online.\nSimilarly, Microsoft Windows and Office are also upgraded using http. You can observe that it is usually not the installation package downloaded from the Microsoft's server, but your ISP's self-built cache server.\n\nA: The top rated answer here is clearly outdated. Since then, there has been 2 serious remote code execution exploits found in apt because of buggy package verification. Security bulletins here and here.\nThis is much worse than the concerns about privacy/information leakage and stale package version; this enables arbitrary code execution as root, complete security failure. And the thing is: These attacks would have been prevented if https was used instead of http.\nThis proves that the defence in depth principle applies here as much as anywhere else. The many claims floating around that https provides no or minimal security benefit in the context of apt is simply incorrect, as has been shown by these exploits.\nThe question then becomes if the security benefit of https is worth the cost in terms of caching, increased overhead etc. I can't answer that, but at the very least I think Ubuntu/Canonical/Launchpad should provide optional https endpoints for their repositories.\n", "Q: Wiping my Hard Drive and dualbooting Ubuntu 13 I've searched far and wide, but still haven't found a way to do what I want;\nI want to set up a GNU GRUB dualboot with windows 7 and ubuntu 13.

Since then, the laptop would fail to recover if I closed its lid to suspend it.

It's quite possible that Network Manager or the frontend to that is broken, but the underlying things are still working.

If you find the zoom factor more useful applied globally, i.e., not just to Nautilus, but to all text on the desktop, you can change it easily in System Settings (gear icon in the upper-right corner of the Unity desktop) ==> Universal Access ==> \"Seeing\" tab. This will change the size of text globally on the desktop.\n", "Q: Dual-boot Windows 7 + Ubuntu,Should I remove FAT32 partition My partitions are as follows:  \n900 MB FAT32 (contains .bat,kernel.sys,bootmgr,bootsect.bak,fdosboot.bin ... etc. files)\n70 GB NTFS (Windows 7) (also contains bootmgr,kernel.sys,bootsect.bak after using boot-repair)\n80 GB ext4 (Ubuntu)\n315 GB NTFS (Personal data)  \nI had dual boot problems after removing ubuntu incorrectly and after using boot-repair I got it solved.The grub menu previously(before problem) showed Win7 as on /dev/sda1,which is the FAT32 partition.After using boot-repair, it shows two options for Win7.One on /dev/sda1 (goes back to the error I was experiencing) and another on /dev/sda2 (actual Win7 installation) which boots me up with Win7.  \nShould I consider it safe to just remove the FAT32 partition?\nI am not using ubuntu much nowadays and again thinking to uninstall it.Could you suggest a good way of not messing up the grub and going back to the Windows Bootloader after removal of Ubuntu? (WinRE bootrec commands do not work)\n\nA: Short answer: If it's working fine now, better leave it as it is.\nThis question is more about the Windows boot setup. Please take a look at this answer on superuser.\n\nThe FAT partition is meant to be the EFI System Partition. Even if your computer is not UEFI enabled or defaults to traditional MBR based boot the Windows installation disk as well as OEM installations create two partitions:\n\n\n*\n\n*the first one marked as system partition where the bootloader files and configuration for EFI and MBR boot are stored\n\n*the second one where the operating system is installed (and in some cases an individual backup boot configuration for MBR and EFI, that's why you can boot directly from the second partition, or via chainloader)\n\n\nYou could delete the first partition and move the second partition the use the free space, but 900 MB isn't worth the hassle that will follow. You will need to reinstall the bootloader and bootconfiguration to the second partition (the setup becomes invalid when you move the partition) via\nbootrec /fixboot\n\nor\nbcdboot c:\\Windows /l en-gb /s c: /f ALL\n\ncommands from the Windows installation disk. Take a look at the above mentioned Superuser answer and the GParted FAQ. You will probably need to mark the second partition as system or boot partition to make the above listed commands work. Then you need to install Grub again and probably everything will be fine again. If Grub's os-prober and boot-repair fail to find your Windows installation or the entry is not properly configured you need to write a customized entry.\nFor example this is a configuration from my laptop that is booting UEFI Grub from a GPT partitioned disk and starting Windows 8 from another MBR partitioned disk by running the EFI Windows bootmanager:\n$ cat /etc/grub.d/40_custom \n#!/bin/sh\nexec tail -n +3 $0\n# This file provides an easy way to add custom menu entries.  Simply type the\n# menu entries you want to add after this comment.  Be careful not to change\n# the 'exec tail' line above.\n\nmenuentry \"Windows 8 (UEFI configuration on system drive)\" {\n        insmod part_msdos\n        insmod ntfs\n        insmod search_fs_uuid\n        insmod chain\n\n        set root='hd0,msdos4'\n        if [ x$feature_platform_search_hint = xy ]; then\n          search --no-floppy --fs-uuid --set=root --hint-bios=hd0,msdos4 --hint-efi=hd0,msdos4 --hint-baremetal=ahci0,msdos4  2ACC7043CC700B79\n        else\n          search --no-floppy --fs-uuid --set=root 2ACC7043CC700B79\n        fi\n\n        chainloader /EFI/Microsoft/Boot/bootmgfw.efi\n}\n\nIt's really not worth the hassle and risk. Instead you could do a clean and proper reinstall of Windows to one partition, and reinstall and configure Grub afterwards.\n", "Q: File truncated to 0 bytes during power failure Power went down while editing a file with Geany and the file got truncated to 0 bytes ...

The advertised memory is never the actual memory. Some of the space is required for memory allocation.\nAlso, from what I understand from your question, your pen-drive has 700mb in it and 7gb free? That means you've access to 7.7gb. It's pretty good imo.\n\nA: Yes no pen drive in the world will have full access to its memory. If it is a 8gb pendrive it will have the full capacity at laboratory level only. So your pendrive is showing its full capacity based on the conditions out side the laboratory.

However, they can modify and write to the contents of the file. How to do this from command line.\n\nA: Quoting Stephane Chazelas from this answer on Unix & Linux SE.\n\nTo rename a file, write permissions to the file don't matter, renaming\n  a file is a change to the directory, not the file. That's changing the\n  directory entry to have a different name pointing to the file.\nSo all you need to do is change the permissions of the directory. For\n  instance:\nchown root: .\nchmod 755 .\n\nThat will prevent users from renaming files in there, but also from\n  creating or deleting files. If you still want them to be able to do\n  that, you could instead make the directory writeable but also set the\n  t bit. With that bit set, users (other than the owner of the\n  directory who is not restricted) can only delete or rename the files\n  they own.\nchown root:people-who-can-create-file-here .\nchmod 1775 .\nchown root:people-who-can-modify-the-files file1-that-must-not-be-rename ...\nchmod 664 file1-that-must-not-be-rename ...\n\n\n\nA: chmod +t [FILE]\nIt sets the sticky bit, which does exactly what you describe.\nEDIT: Well, to be more specific it prevents other users from renaming the file. So depends on what you want, exactly.\n", "Q: What is the difference between grep apple file and grep \"apple\" file? What is the difference between grep apple file and grep \"apple\" file? What does putting the quotation marks do? They both appear to work and do the exact same thing (display same line).\n\nA: The quotation marks have an effect on what characters your shell considers special and to have a syntactic meaning. In your example this doesn't make a difference because apple contains no such characters.\nBut consider another example: grep apple tree file will search for the word apple in the files tree and file, whereas grep \"apple tree\" file will search the word apple tree in the file file. The quotation marks tell bash, that the word space in \"apple tree\" does not start a new parameter but shall be part of the current parameter. grep apple\\ tree file would produce the same result, because \\ tells bash to disregard the special meaning of the following character and treat it literally.\n\nA: Double quotes allow evaluation, single quotes prevent evaluaton, no quotes allow wildcard expansion, when used on command line.  As contrived examples:\n[user@work test]$ ls .\nA.txt B.txt C.txt D.cpp\n\n# The following is the same as writing echo 'A.txt B.txt C.txt D.cpp'\n[user@work test]$ echo *\nA.txt B.txt C.txt D.cpp\n\n[user@work test]$ echo \"*\"\n*\n\n[user@work test]$ echo '*'\n*\n\n# The following is the same as writing echo 'A.txt B.txt C.txt'\n[user@work test]$ echo *.txt\nA.txt B.txt C.txt\n\n[user@work test]$ echo \"*.txt\"\n*.txt\n\n[user@work test]$ echo '*.txt'\n*.txt\n\n[user@work test]$ myname=is Fred; echo $myname\nbash: Fred: command not found\n\n[user@work test]$ myname=is\\ Fred; echo $myname\nis Fred\n\n[user@work test]$ myname=\"is Fred\"; echo $myname\nis Fred\n\n[user@work test]$ myname='is Fred'; echo $myname\nis Fred\n\nUnderstanding the way quotes work is pivotal to understanding Bash.  For example:\n# for will operate on each file name separately (like an array), looping 3 times.\n[user@work test]$ for f in $(echo *txt); do echo \"$f\"; done;\nA.txt\nB.txt\nC.txt\n\n# for will see only the string, 'A.txt B.txt C.txt' and loop just once.\n[user@work test]$ for f in \"$(echo *txt)\"; do echo \"$f\"; done;\nA.txt B.txt C.txt\n\n# this just returns the string - it can't be evaluated in single quotes.\n[user@work test]$ for f in '$(echo *txt)'; do echo \"$f\"; done;\n$(echo *txt)\n\nYou can use single quotes to pass a command via a variable.  Single quotes will prevent evaluation.  Double quotes will evaluate.\n# This returns three distinct elements, like an array.\n[user@work test]$ echo='echo *.txt'; echo $($echo)\nA.txt B.txt C.txt\n\n# This returns what looks like three elements, but it is actually a single string.\n[user@work test]$ echo='echo *.txt'; echo \"$($echo)\"\nA.txt B.txt C.txt\n\n# This cannot be evaluated, so it returns whatever is between quotes, literally.\n[user@work test]$ echo='echo *.txt'; echo '$($echo)'\n$($echo)\n\nYou can use single quotes inside double quotes and you can use double quotes inside double quotes, but double quotes inside single quotes should not be done (without escaping them) will not be evaluated, they will be interpreted literally.  Single quotes within single quotes should not be done (without escaping them).\nYou'll need to gain a thorough understanding of quotes to use Bash effectively.  Very important!\nAs a general rule, I don't use quotes if I want Bash to expand something into elements (like an array), I use single quotes for literal strings that are not to be altered, and I make liberal use of double quotes for variables that are likely to return any type of string.  This is to ensure that spaces and special characters will be preserved.\n", "Q: Rollback to Windows 8.1 From Ubuntu 13.04 while trying to install Ubuntu I accidentally wiped out the HDD and now my Windows 8 is gone and I'm trying to install it back whether alongside with Ubuntu or alone.\nI downloaded the windows 8.1 ISO and the win-7 USB Dvd tool but of course they're .exe files so I downloaded \"wine\" but it didn't work and now I'm stuck with ubuntu and the files mentioned above\nNOTE: I have an ultrabook so I don't have CD/DVD drive installed which means I'm only capable of using USB-stick\nand there's noway that this post is duplicated\n\nA: There is a program that will burn Win 8 to a flash drive that may be better than Unetbootin for you.

Here's the error I get:\n\nBlender, the free open source 3D content creation suite is required for this action (http://www.blender.org).\nPlease check the preferences in OpenShot and be sure the Blender executable is correct.

Any help greatly appreciated, fairly new to both Ubuntu & linux\n\nA: You will need to download the drivers from the canon website, since Ubuntu does not provide these drivers. at least for me the drivers Ubuntu provided for canon were not doing their job correctly.\nWhat you need to do:\nBrowse to the canon website and look for support & downloads for your printer\nSelect Linux as your OS and search for the correct drivers. You will need the debian package of the IJ printer driver and the Scangear driver, which is needed for printing and scanning respectively.\nIf you downloaded these, you will need to run them via the terminal, which should happen automatically if you double click on it.\nIf you did that for both drivers, printing will function correctly. If you want to scan something, you will need to type \"scangearmp\" in the terminal, which causes the scanning software to run.\nFurthermore: Some websites of canon don't have the drivers for Linux.

If you installed Ubuntu on Computer A and it set Computer A's ESP to mount at /boot/efi, then when you moved the disk to Computer B and tried to boot, it would of course be unable to locate Computer A's ESP, and so you'd get the error about being unable to mount /boot/efi. I can think of a number of workarounds for this, but the best one probably depends on your computers' disk configurations (including the shared external disk); however, if you're just booting on Computer B on a temporary basis to debug the problem, it might be best to leave it alone. If you need help fixing this problem, please post the output of sudo parted -l on both systems, with the external disk connected to at least one of them. (Use an emergency disk to boot Computer A, if necessary.)\nAs to your Computer A boot problems, this could be an issue of a firmware setting, so you should enter your firmware's setup utility and look for options related to boot devices. It's also possible that the Boot Repair utility could help; but I'd be a bit wary, since your setup is unusual and Boot Repair will make permanent changes to your boot setup -- changes that might help but also might make matters worse. (You'll need to launch Boot Repair from an emergency disc, should you decide to try it.) Another option is to use my rEFInd boot manager. You can use the CD-R or USB flash drive image for testing without making any changes to your hard disk. If it works, boot to Linux and install the Debian package version. This might be more reliable if you ensure that your internal hard disk's ESP is mounted at /boot/efi, rather than the ESP on your external disk (if it has one).\n", "Q: How can I know which machine Juju is actually using? I am trying Juju on Azure and I have installed quite a few services that I have now destroyed to keep only the minimum services. But now I can see I have 8 virtual machines created on Azure while I have reduced the number of services to just 4. So I guess when Juju needs a new machine it creates it but then destroying the service did not destroy the machine it was running on.\nHow can I do some cleanup? I would like to know which machines are unused and destroy them.\n\nA: Doing a juju status will show you all the machines running. It depends on which commands you run:\njuju destroy-service <service-name>\n\nwill destroy only the service. You probably want either:\njuju destroy-unit\n\nor \njuju destroy-machine\n\nTo clean up what you have you probably can do a juju status, see which machines are not assigned to services, and then destroy those by referrring them by number, like: juju destroy-machine 3 as an example.\nAll of these are documented here:\n\n\n*\n\n*https://jujucharms.com/docs/stable/charms-destroy\n", "Q: firefox not preserving the home page settings after restart Whenever I change the Firefox homepage from yahoo.com (about:config, enter new address in list), the changes are not preserved when I restart Firefox.\nWhat can I do?\n\nA: Here you go , Firefox have provided a Guide for you.\nIt consists of several cases that can cause the issue you got.\nThe problem seems to appear due to user don't have enough permissions to save his settings to  prefs.js file. so locate the file and change the permissions to the file as \nto locate the file\nlocate prefs.js\n\nthen you will get some output similar to this\n/home/jai/.mozilla/firefox/gvj89mfl.default/prefs.js\n\ntake the firefox prefs.js path from your home folder.\nthen \nchmod 755  <path to prefs.js file>\n\nwill resolve your issue. \nhttps://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/how-to-fix-preferences-wont-save#w_unable-to-save-any-preferences-or-settings\n", "Q: Ubuntu 13.04 custom keyboard layout Using Ubuntu 13.04, I want the PrtSc key to work as Menu on Lenovo S430 keyboard.\n/usr/bin/xmodmap /home/user/.Xmodmap\n\nwith modified line\nkeycode 107 = Menu NoSymbol Menu NoSymbol Menu\n\nDoes not work.\nAny advice?\n\nA: First, add the following line at the end of ~/.Xmodmap file:\nkeycode 107 = Menu\n\nSecond, run this command in terminal:\nxmodmap ~/.Xmodmap\n\nThird, go to System settings → Keyboard, select Shortcuts tab, go to Screenshots and disable or change the value for Take a screenshoot (this doesn't have to be anymore Print key)\n", "Q: Flash Player Minimizes, 2 Monitors I have to screens.

I've recently bought my desktop a PNY Geforce GTX 650 TI Boost so I could play Steam games on Ubuntu. I've also bought a brand-new 500 W power supply unit because my older one wouldn't be able to handle the extra work and didn't have a PCI-e plug. \nAfter carefully installing the hardware, I proceded to install the drivers. In order to do so, I've followed Luis Alvarado's tips from here. Baiscally, it involved installing the nvidia-325 package from the xorg-edgers PPA then running sudo nvidia-xconfig to create a new xorg.conf.\nThe instalation seems to have gone without errors or even warnings, and my computer was finally able to run resource-intensive games. However, every now and then the computer freezes. To better describe the problem:\n\n\n*\n\n*The screen always freezes;\n\n*The sound usually goes into a loop (rarely it keeps runnning, indicating that only the screen had freezed);\n\n*There's absolutely no mouse or regular keyboard feedback. 90% of the time I have to Alt+PrtScrn+R+E+I+S+U+B my way through a restart, but sometimes not even that works;\n\n*It seems to occur at random intervals, usually when I'm running Steam games, but sometimes when I'm on Unity, working on spreadsheets and statistics software. What intrigues me is that sometimes it occurs even before the system boots (at the first POST screen, which presents the Geforce card). This makes me wonder whether the problem isn't actually in the hardware itself (which would be a shame, because it costed me a small fortune and I can't return it anymore).\n\n\nSo far, none of these has solved the issue:\n\n\n*\n\n*Reinstalling the 325 driver;\n\n*Installing older drivers;\n\n*Installing nvidia-settings to see if there were any problems such as overheating (there isn't: the card runs at a comfy 45 Celsius even after extensive work);\n\n*Installing steam-login in an attempt to bypass any issues the card might be having with my onboard Intel graphics.\n\n\nSince the problem sometimes occur during POST, I guess configuring something on my My CMOS might help. The problem is I'm kind of lost. Here's some settings I think might help (from \"Advanced Chipset Features\"):\n\n\n*\n\n*Intel EIST: Enabled (GV3);\n\n*Intel XD Bit: Enabled (when disabled, force the XD feature flag to always return 0)\n\n*Intel VT: Enabled (when enabled, a VMM can utilize the additional HW Caps. provided by Intel Virtualization Tech)\n\n*Memory Hole Remapping: Enabled (allow remapping of overlapped PCI memory above the total physical memory)\n\n*Video Memory Size: 32MB (other options: 64MB and 128MB)\n\n*DVMT Mode: DVMT (other option: fixed)\n\n*DVMT/Fixed Memory Size: 256MB (other options: 128MB and Maximum)\n\n\nMy computer is plugged to a 24' LG TV through an HDMI cable, instead of a regular monitor. Could this be the source of the problem (or worsen it)? Unfortunately, I don't have a computer monitor here to test it. All I know is that even though I feel like I've already read all the \"My computer is freezing\" questions on Ask Ubuntu, I've run out of ideas on how to diagnose and fix the problem.\n\nA: As you stated. The crashes even come in while booting. You clearly have a hardware problem.  You should fix those before trying anything on the software side.\nI have never had trouble with HDMI or heard that this can cause crashes. You have already ruled out heating problem. \nYou should check if your graphics card and the power cables are all properly connected. Try switching one component after the other. Try a different old graphics card or, if available, the on-board graphics card. \n\n\n*\n\n*Maybe you can test the Nvidia graphics-card and the PSU in a different computer?\n\n*Also, did you test the CPU temperature? Maybe your CPU heat-sink got a little lose and that is causing the unstable system?\n\n*Did one of your RAM components turn bad? If you have more than one, try to remove one and test again.\n\n*If all this still doesn't single out all the component that runs unstable you will finally have to test the motherboard, which will inevitably mean a lot a work.\n\n\nEdit added the additional info from the comments.\n\nA: So after 1,5 years of testing it seems I've finally solved this problem. All it took was sheding some light into the issue. Literally.\nThis is what I was only able to see after putting some bright, direct light into my PCIe slot:\n\nI'm guessing this happened when I first inserted my video card into that slot. The card may have pushed a couple of pins upward, shorting the circuit and causing all those freezes.\nThe only tool I had to reach that narrow space and try to unjam those wires was a pocket knife. I was half desperate, half okay with the fact that I'd have to get another motherboard if I wanted to game in my machine, so I just went ahead and started shoving that knife in there and pushing those wires back and down, to see if I could put them back in their places. I do not recommend this technique.\nMy technique had everything to go wrong. However, it did work, and my system's been freeze-free for over a month.\n", "Q: Cannot get Nvidia drivers working on Lenovo Y510P I cannot get nVidia drivers to load on my Lenovo Y510p.

You may use the computer normally within this period;\nUnplug the power cord and set the computer to hibernate automatically at 5% as described by the image sequence below (click images to enlarge). If you cannot select 5%, then you should use the minimum value allowed, but never below 5%;\n\n\nLeave the computer discharging, non-stop, until it hibernates itself. You may use the computer normally within this period;\nWhen the computer shuts down completely, let it stay in the hibernation state for 5 hours or even more;\nPlug the computer to the A/C power to perform a full charge non-stop until its maximum capacity (100%). You may use the computer normally within this period.\n\nAfter the calibration process, the reported wear level is usually higher than before. This is natural, since it now reports the true current capacity that the battery has to hold charge. Lithium Ion batteries have a limit amount of discharge cycles (generally 200 to 300 cycles) and they will retain less capacity over time.\nMany people tend to think \"If calibrating gives higher wear level, then it's a bad thing\". This is wrong, because like said, the calibration is meant to have your battery report the true capacity it can hold, and it's meant to avoid surprises like, for example, being in the middle of a presentation and suddenly the computer shuts down at 30% of charge.\n\nA: May be you are are having a lot of addons and plugins installed in fire fox browser.Try to fix it.

Example:\ncurl http://example.com/123 | head -n 3\n\n\nA: For curl in particular, there is an option to only load a range of bytes.  Because it's bytes instead of lines, you may need to overestimate and then trim with head or tail, but this might save load-time on long webpages (or the byte-range may be sufficient for your application.)  For example, \ncurl --range 0-99 http://example.com/123\n\nwill get the first 100 bytes.  (You can also pull out a range in the middle of the page, give multiple disjoint ranges, or use a range measured from the end of the page.) \n(I don't know for sure, but I think curl will load the whole webpage even if it's piped to a command that only reads the first few lines.) \n", "Q: Where is my Ubuntu installed? I installed Ubuntu 13.04 alongside Windows 8 using the iso file from official website. In Ubuntu 12.04, I used wubi to install and then it was clear that Ubuntu was installed in Windows. I installed Ubuntu 13.04 without wubi and I could not figure out whether Ubuntu is installed in Windows or Windows resides in Ubuntu.\nFollowing screenshots may give a hint.\nIn Windows, this 378GB disk was my C: Drive.\n\nI have no idea where this SYSTEM came from.\nHere comes the Ubuntu root directory.\n\nIs it that SYSTEM is now the head of both C: Drive and Ubuntu? \nP.S: I asked this question here as having this confusion will definitely trouble people in upgrading windows or Ubuntu and when anything is problematic with Ubuntu, people come to this website.\n\nA: Everything appears fine with your system. You installed Ubuntu alongside Windows and that's how they are: 2 (separate) operating systems side by side, with the option to choose one or the other when you boot. One is not inside of or controlling the other.\nI think your question stems from the nature of Wubi, where Ubuntu appears to Windows as just another Windows program and is installed as a file within the Windows partition. Wubi does not work with 13.04 and the Wubi way is not the way a regular installation of Ubuntu works.\nHere's the key part that I think will answer your question: An operating system when it is not running the computer is just another collection of files in a disk partition. \nWindows cannot read the Linux file format, so you don't see any evidence of Ubuntu when browsing your C:\\ drive in Windows. You can however see the existence of the Ubuntu partition from Disk Manager in the Administrative tools, if your version of Windows lets you access that.\nUbuntu, however, can read and mount the Windows partitions. System is the Windows created boot partition. You should leave it alone. The 378 GB partition is the C:\\ drive. There's not enough info here to know what the other partition is, but it's likely a data partition D:\\, or a Windows recovery partition. You may decide you don't need this partition and use it for something else, but be careful and research how your particular computer model is set up. You can usually find this info at the manufacturer's support site.\nIt's probably not a good idea to mount and open files on your C:\\ drive from Ubuntu very often. You may want to make an NTFS formatted partition to share files between the two operating systems, or you could use an external USB stick or drive.\n", "Q: How force that all connections to my Apache use TLSv1.1 or TLSv1.2?

If you are using English then only the data for English will be downloaded (apart from any other updates needed). If you are using French, Spanish, Chinese or any other language, the size of the data will increase or decrease depending on the size of the language packs needed.\n\n*How long since the official release are you installing Ubuntu. If you are installing Ubuntu the same day that specific version was released, the amount of updates will be minimal. If however, you are installing Ubuntu 6 months after it was released, you will get 6 months worth of updates. This can vary a lot. From 200 MB worth of updates to 700 MB. I once got 1.1 GB of updates when I tried installing a LTS a 14 months after it was released.\n\n*Which version of Ubuntu you are installing. Since 12.04, versions of Ubuntu have slowly but surely lowered the amount of data needed for upgrades. The size of many packages have lowered. So it is not the same to update 11.10 than to update 13.04.\n\n*Which Ubuntu distro you are using. Ubuntu alone has an amount of packages that will need to update after a certain amount of time. If you have KDE, it would need a bit more. Same goes for other official distros based on Ubuntu. They would have to download, not only the core components found on the Ubuntu repositories, but also the packages needed for the Desktop system (KDE packages for Kubuntu, LXDE packages for Lubuntu...)\nSo in general, depending on the time of release, the delta between installation time and release time, the Ubuntu version and the Ubuntu distro you will have to download data sizes that can change from 1 KB to 1 GB (Am exaggerating with the 1 GB but the point being that it varies a lot).\n\nA: You can install Ubuntu entirely offline if you want to, as long as you have an install DVD or USB key.\n\nA: You can defer the installation of the updates until after the installation. Then via package updater, you can see the packages to be updated. Underneath the list of packages, you will see the total amount of data to be downloaded stated in MBs :)\n\nA: No data will be consumed while installing Ubuntu (offline). You can download any linux distro & install it via USB or live CD/DVD's.\n\nA: The answer to this question will vary a lot.  You can as pointed out by other answers you can install Ubuntu without a working internet connection so the answer is zero.\nBut if you choose to let it update as its installing which many people do then it will download the updates to the packages you have since the DVD image was produced.  The older the image the more updates there are likely to be.\nIf you do decide to install offline then Ubuntu will download all the updates the first time you run Update Manager.\n", "Q: ubuntu 13.04 not booting with Gigabyte GT440 I installed Ubuntu 13.04 in my PC.

I am trying out Juju and while playing I created a service, Django, and then Mongodb. I associated them and then destroyed mongodb. Now my Django service is in an error status: agent-state-info: 'hook failed: \"relation-broken\"'. I have tried to destroy the relation with juju destroy-relation python-django mongodb to no avail. Mongodb still appears in juju status but in 'dying' state, it's been a few hours since I have destroyed it. I have not done any actual work on this service so I can destroy it and start again from scratch but while learning I would like to know if there is a cleaner way to solve that situation.\n\nA: First, the annoyingly \"in hindsight\" bit. It is always a good idea to remove relations before destroying services: https://jujucharms.com/docs/stable/charms-destroy\nOnce a machine is in an error state, Juju will not process any hooks for that service - even ones to destroy it. That is to protect against potential data loss.\nHowever there is a mechanism to return the machine to a responsive state:\njuju resolved <machine identifier>\n\ne.g.\njuju resolved mongodb/0\n\nThis will re-enable the execution of hooks for that machine/service.

I'm trying to learn Django. I installed a Bitnami Django stack on a Virtualbox with Ubuntu 64.\nMy issue is that, when I run the server, I have no idea how to visit the web page from my host computer (Windows 7, 64).\nDo i need to do some complex configuration in order to visit the hosted website ?\n\nA: It depends on the network adapter configuration of the virtual machine.\nThe easier case is if you have a bridged adapter so the virtual machine guest looks like just another machine in your network. If the guest is configured to receive an IP address via DHCP (pretty much default setup), just point your browser at http://IP-ADDRESS-OF-GUEST/ and it should work.\nIf you have NAT-ed network adapter in your virtual machine, it means it works as if the guest OS was sitting behind a router. It is still possible to access the web server, but you need to do the „dreaded” port forward.\nRead up on the VB manual (Configuring Port Forwarding with NAT). But as an example here is a command-line that creates a forwarded port (VM name is your virtual machine's name):\nvboxmanage modifyvm \"VM name\" --natpf1 \"guesthttp,tcp,,80,,80\"\n\nNow you should reach your webserver at http://localhost/ or http://127.0.0.1/ or even http://IP-ADDRESS-OF-HOST/ (but the latter requires your host firewall is configured to receive traffic on port 80).\nThere is also a graphical way to do the port forward, you can find it in the configuration section of a NAT-ted virtual adapter. Quite straightforward to set up, but you can refer to this HTG Article on the subject.\n\nA: This seems more like a windows specific thing than Ubuntu. If it were a linux box that hosted your virtual machine you could do port forwarding by\nssh user@<ip of virtual machine> -L9999:localhost:<port hosted on>\nThis way you could go you http:// localhost:9999 and you would be at the site hosted on your virtual machine. \nSorry I don't know how to do this from windows since I'm not sure how putty might handle this =\\  \nThough I do know that when a machine has jenkins which hosts a web interface on port 8080 as long as you are on the same lan you can go to .local:8080 so maybe something like that would work. To know your avahi name or just to set it manually edit /etc/avahi/avahi-daemon.conf and change the host-name line to equal whatever name you want it and run sudo service avahi-daemon restart \nAlso make sure when setting host-name to leave no space on either side of the = sign\n", "Q: Ubuntu font override How and what fonts does the Ubuntu system override?\nWhen browsing many sites I see an alternative font than Verdana, overridden by Ubuntu OS.\nI would like to set up the same for my Gentoo.\n\nA: To use, in a site, the Ubuntu Google font just put the follow code (from Ubuntu.com source) in the site root html page, after the  and before the \n<link href='https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Ubuntu:400,300,300italic,400italic,700,700italic|Ubuntu+Mono' rel='stylesheet' type='text/css' />\n\nThen you can use Ubuntu fonts by changing in the css files the\nfont-family: Ubuntu \nTo download, add and use Ubuntu font to your system you can use TypeCatcher \n", "Q: How to remove other OS to free space?

First some background: I have dual-boot Windows 7 / Ubuntu 13.04 on Lenovo laptop. As I did the installation about 1.5 years ago and was then even more un-savvy linux user than I am now, I can't recall everything I did to get both OSes up and running. However, I do remember that it was quite troublesome procedure (running boot-repair at least once).\nNow I'm considering trying another linux distro in addition to Ubuntu (most likely Arch), and this time I'd like to do it in a way that I have an idea what I'm doing (and possibly learn more about 'inner workings' of linux distros).\nSo that's enough for the background. Now my question is: How do I get information on what is my current grub / boot-loader configuration?\nThis seems to be first and quite separate issue to consider before even dreaming about installing a third OS and more advanced messing with partitions and boot.\n\nA: Use the BootInfoScript\nCheck out the README if you have prblems running it.\n\nA: To view your /boot/grub/grub/cfg file, you might use the following command,\nless /boot/grub/grub.cfg\n\nPress your up or down arrow keys to scroll up and down the file, use your 'q' key to quit and return to your regular terminal prompt.\nThe grub-mkconfig program runs other scripts and programs such as grub-mkdevice.map and grub-probe and then generates a new grub.cfg file. It also reads files in /etc/default/grub and the /etc/grub.d/debian theme file to tell it what to do. Those are the files we can edit or create for ourselves to change our GRUB settings. I'll show you more about that later.\nBelow here is an example of a grub.cfg for a new Ubuntu installation in a computer that already has one other Ubuntu installation dual booting with Windows XP.\nI have highlighted the commented lines in yellow to draw your attention to them.\nYou should notice that they each mark the beginning and ending of their own section of the grub.cfg and they appear in numerical sequence starting from the /etc/grub.d/00_header at the top.\nThe last section of this file is the /etc/grub.d/40_custom area at the bottom of the grub.cfg file.\nEach of these sections of the grub.cfg file are controlled by the scripts with the same names, and those are the ones we edit to make changes to our grub.cfg.\nThe changes will come into effect right after we run 'sudo grub-mkconfig -o /boot/grub/grub.cfg' to write the new grub.cfg file.\n", "Q: How to open templates using vim?

The pcmanfm.conf file in:\n/home/user/.config/pcmanfm/default\n\nsaves view_mode=[0,1,2,3] for all folders. Default being 0 (icon view), I chose not to change it. Now, I made a new config file called album and created a shortcut on PCManFM desktop (removed nautilus recently) called videos (which is a folder). Since videos are better viewed as thumbnails, I set view_mode in album to 2. Here's the Exec line in videos.desktop file:\nExec=pcmanfm --profile=album \"/home/user/Downloads/videos\"\n\nThis works fine when PCManFM desktop isn't running. But if it is, no such settings or configs works! So, I was wondering if there was a workaround for this.NOTE: I've tried this many time by killing pcmanfm desktop process and opening videos folder. It only works when desktop isn't running!ubuntu version 12.10pcmanfm version 1.0.1\n\nA: From https://specifications.freedesktop.org/desktop-entry-spec/desktop-entry-spec-latest.html#exec-variables:\n\nThe Exec key must contain a command line. A command line consists of an executable program optionally followed by one or more arguments. The executable program can either be specified with its full path or with the name of the executable only. If no full path is provided the executable is looked up in the $PATH environment variable used by the desktop environment. The name or path of the executable program may not contain the equal sign (\"=\"). Arguments are separated by a space.\n\nSo, because of that equal sign from --profile=album, I think you have a problem. What you can do is to use a simple script like this:\n#!/bin/bash\n\n/usr/bin/pcmanfm --profile=album \"/home/user/Downloads/videos\"\n\nDon't forget to make the script executable:\nchmod +x /path/to/script\n\nAnd finally add in your videos.desktop file this line:\nExec=/path/to/script\n\nThis method worked for me all the time.\n", "Q: Add a virtual interface to the same subnet and route both What I am trying to accomplish is extremely close to this, with one twist.

I've no idea how that could happen while the Ubuntu partition has 10+ GB of free space.\nSo my question is: how can I expand the \"size\" of /usr, which makes no sense to me that it is not using the free space in the partition.\nThanks much!\nThe output of mount is as follows:\n/dev/loop0 on / type ext4 (rw,errors=remount-ro)\nproc on /proc type proc (rw,noexec,nosuid,nodev)\nsysfs on /sys type sysfs (rw,noexec,nosuid,nodev)\nnone on /sys/fs/fuse/connections type fusectl (rw)\nnone on /sys/kernel/debug type debugfs (rw)\nnone on /sys/kernel/security type securityfs (rw)\nudev on /dev type devtmpfs (rw,mode=0755)\ndevpts on /dev/pts type devpts (rw,noexec,nosuid,gid=5,mode=0620)\ntmpfs on /run type tmpfs (rw,noexec,nosuid,size=10%,mode=0755)\nnone on /run/lock type tmpfs (rw,noexec,nosuid,nodev,size=5242880)\nnone on /run/shm type tmpfs (rw,nosuid,nodev)\n/dev/sda7 on /host type vfat (rw,relatime,fmask=0022,dmask=0022,codepage=437,iocharset=iso8859-1,shortname=mixed,errors=remount-ro)\n/host/ubuntu/disks/usr.disk on /usr type ext4 (rw)\n/host/ubuntu/disks/home.disk on /home type ext4 (rw)\ngvfs-fuse-daemon on /home/yzhanghf/.gvfs type fuse.gvfs-fuse-daemon (rw,nosuid,nodev,user=yzhanghf)\n/dev/sda6 on /media/Scientific type fuseblk (rw,nosuid,nodev,allow_other,default_permissions,blksize=4096)\n/dev/sda5 on /media/Software type fuseblk (rw,nosuid,nodev,allow_other,default_permissions,blksize=4096)\n/dev/sda2 on /media/OS type fuseblk (rw,nosuid,nodev,allow_other,default_permissions,blksize=4096)\n/dev/sda1 on /media/SYSTEM type fuseblk (rw,nosuid,nodev,allow_other,default_permissions,blksize=4096)\n\n\nA: If you install on a FAT32 partition, then there is a limitation on individual files to a max size of 4 GB or so. So, Wubi will split the install into up to 3 virtual disks (root.disk, usr.disk, home.disk) depending on the size you want. (Max 12 GB). \nUnfortunately 4 GB isn't enough for /usr on a normal install as it quickly grows over time. Your best bet is to use an NTFS partition where you can have a single root.disk of up to 30 GB, or to use the partition for a direct install (if you have a free partition, why would you use Wubi anyway?)\n\nA: WUBI is known for causing weird problems if it was installed on a newer machine. I recommend you remove it and do a proper Ubuntu install.\nIf you want to fix it regardless; it looks to me like /usr is mounted as a separate partition.\nPost the output of the command\nmount\n\n", "Q: Invalid User vs. User Not Allowed in ssh log When looking at the auth.log:\nFrom a security perspective, what is the difference between \"Invalid User\" and \"User Not allowed because not listed in \"AllowUsers.\"\nExamples:\nNov  6 10:42:37 ePVPNDMZ01X sshd[12598]: Invalid user cni07 from <IP Address>\nNov  4 07:28:15 ePVPNDMZ01X sshd[2722]: User root from <IP Address> not allowed because not listed in AllowUsers\n\n\nA: Invalid user means the ssh request was made by a user name on the system, \"cni07\" in this case. There is no user \"cni07\"\nUser not allowed means there is a user, \"root\" in this case, but that user is not allowed to log in via ssh.

In /etc/default/ufw change the DEFAULT_FORWARD_POLICY to \"ACCEPT\"”:\nDEFAULT_FORWARD_POLICY=\"ACCEPT\"\n\nThen edit /etc/ufw/sysctl.conf and uncomment the following (I guess your script for starting virtual hotspot already does set IP Forwarding, so you can skip this step or may want to remove IP forwarding line from your script):\nnet/ipv4/ip_forward=1\n\nSimilarly, for IPv6 forwarding uncomment:\nnet/ipv6/conf/default/forwarding=1\n\nNow we will add rules to the /etc/ufw/before.rules file. The default rules only configure the filter table, and to enable masquerading the nat table will need to be configured. Add the following to the top of the file just after the header comments (again, if you have a script that you use to start your hotspot, you can, or probably should, remove any lines relating to masqueradaing from there):\n# nat Table rules\n*nat\n:POSTROUTING ACCEPT [0:0]\n\n# Forward traffic through eth8.\n-A POSTROUTING -s 192.168.0.0/24 -o eth8 -j MASQUERADE\n\n# don't delete the 'COMMIT' line or these nat table rules won't be processed\nCOMMIT\n\nThe comments are not strictly necessary, but it is considered good practice to document your configuration. Also, when modifying any of the rules files in /etc/ufw, make sure these lines are the last line for each table modified:\n# don't delete the 'COMMIT' line or these rules won't be processed\nCOMMIT\n\nFor each Table a corresponding COMMIT statement is required. In these examples only the nat and filter tables are shown, but you can also add rules for the raw and mangle tables.\n[Note]  \n\nIn the above example replace eth8 and 192.168.0.0/24 with the appropriate interfaces and IP range for your network.\nFinally, disable and re-enable ufw to apply the changes:\nsudo ufw disable && sudo ufw enable\n\nIP Masquerading should now be enabled. You can also add any additional FORWARD rules to the /etc/ufw/before.rules. It is recommended that these additional rules be added to the ufw-before-forward chain.\n", "Q: Which USB touchpads works well in Ubuntu 12.04 I would like to replace my mouse with an external USB touchpad. Which USB touchpad will give me the least amount of driver headache in Ubuntu 12.04?\n\nA: It depends on whether there is a driver - either opensource or by the manufacturer (or both) - for your touchpad. Check the manufacturers support site for linux drivers or google for your preferred touchpad together with \"ubuntu driver\".\nTouchpads by Synaptics will work definitely. You need to get the driver via apt:\nsudo apt-get install xserver-xorg-input-synaptics \n\n", "Q: Device for boot loader installation via USB I have used Ubuntu before, and really enjoyed using it, but it was set up by a friend of mine in the computer science department of our university, and we were making a dual-boot out of my netbook. Now, however, there is a different sort of problem. My home-base computer is a rather old mac book pro, and instead of dual-booting that, what I want to do is make my USB a bootable copy of Ubuntu. However, when I go to install it on the correct drive device, I am asked to choose \"Device for boot loader installation,\" and I do not know which one to choose. I have found that it is much easier to do this initial installing on a PC, so I am using the ones that my University provides for students to use, but I do not want to break the computer's functionality since I might have to pay for it and I a rather broke grad student. \nThe current break down of my options: \n/dev/sda /dev/sda1 ntfs \n/dev/sdc and /dev/sdc1 fat32  \n\nThe sda drives are the SATA drive for my school computer and the sdc drives are the one that I want to install ubuntu to.\n\nA: /dev/sdc is your usb drive. If you want to install ubuntu in usb drive then select \"/dev/sdc1\" for your ubuntu operating system installation and for bootloader installation select \"/dev/sdc\". Keep in mind /dev/sdc1 for os installation and /dev/sdc is for bootloader installation. In this way your pc hard disk will be untouched and ubuntu will be totally installed to usb.\n\nA: Here is a link explaining how to create a bootable usb stick via a windows machine:\n\nhttp://www.ubuntu.com/download/desktop/create-a-usb-stick-on-windows\nThis link shows links for OSX and linux as well:\n\nhttp://www.ubuntu.com/download/desktop\nIt takes a healthy chunk of time to run from start to finish, but is a very handy/powerful tool.\n\nA: /sdc drive is probably your usb - its formated in fat32 (thats common for them). If you want to install ubuntu on usb without 'touching' pc, you need to select your usb as device for bootloader installation. As i said it's probably /sdc. This setting is (in my opinion :) ) very handy because you have full os on your usb key and you can run it on every ppc that supports usb boot.\nAlso if you are afraid about damaging something you can run ubuntu cd in virtual machine and install it on usb - even if you screw something up its just virtual machine :)\n", "Q: Can't access unallocated old internal HDD on Ubuntu 12.04 I installed Ubuntu 12.04 at new HDD. \nAnd now want to move my work files from old hard drive to new.\nI caught some trouble with this, I can't access this disk now.\nBut all was correct during installation (connection was established and worked perfect). \nHere is my lsblk:\nnazar_art@nazar-art-System-Product-Name ~ $ lsblk\nNAME   MAJ:MIN RM   SIZE RO TYPE MOUNTPOINT\nsda      8:0    1   3,8G  0 disk \n└─sda1   8:1    1   3,8G  0 part /media/nazar_art/8BAA-7FA6     // usb driver\nsdb      8:16   0 465,8G  0 disk                                // new HDD\n├─sdb1   8:17   0   6,5G  0 part /\n├─sdb2   8:18   0     1K  0 part \n└─sdb5   8:21   0 459,2G  0 part /home\nsdc      8:32   0 149,1G  0 disk                                // old HDD\n\nIt can see my usb driver from which was installed Mint.

I decided to do a complete wipe and start from scratch so I off loaded everything to an external drive.  I thought I was safe.  Not thinking when I installed 12.0.4 I created a new Admin user and a new User for myself.  I wanted to use aliases instead of my name in the computer.  Today I reconnected the external drive to access a spreadsheet.  I did get a message that said some files were not readable.  Also my user file could only see some music folders I created for ripping LPs to CDs but not my data files.  Also the Admin user could not even see the external drive.  I thought a file was a file on an external drive and didn’t even think about permissions associated to a login.  Did I shoot myself in the foot when I created new user names?  Is there anyway I can access my old files.  \n\nA: Hmmm, not being able to see some files seems kind of weird. You may need to change ownership of everything (as long as these are just files from your /home folder and not important ones that depend on their ownership like /etc files) To do a recursive change of ownership I believe\nfind /path/to/external -exec chown Admin:Admin {} \\;\nChange the /path/to/external to the path to the external drive, and Admin to the exact username you want to have access to the files.    \nThe syntax for find can be funny like the escaped colon and the brackets, but it should work. Find just lists all files and folders if not given a specific -name to look for, the -exec flag tells find you want to run some other shell command and pass through one at a time the files it finds, the {} is the place holder where each file name will be passed and then the command will be run. You may need a sudo or two in there.  \nAlso have you tried to sudo su root and look around like that?

The problem is that though VirtualBox shows the size of the virtual machine's hard drive to be 40 Gb (dynamic), df-h command executed within the virtual machine shows that /dev/sda1 has only 4Gb, which is not enough for my needs:\n/dev/sda1       4.0G  970M  2.8G  26% /\nHow can I ensure that my the Vagrant Ubuntu VM has enough space (e.g. 20Gb) on its sda1 partition?\n\nA: Those are automatically built Vagrant Ubuntu Cloud Images, we have no control over how they were built.\nYou either build your own vagrant box or 1. resize existing virtual HDD 2. Attach additional virtual HDDs, create file systems and mount it (e.g. /ops and install new stuff in this directory).\nPersonally I think option 2 is easier.\nIf you want to go with option 1, you'll have to convert the existing virtual HDD (VMDK) to VDI, because VBoxManage modifyhd only works with native VDI image. However, vagrant base boxes are basically exported OVF/OVA using VMDK format.\nSee VirtualBox Docs\n\nThe --resize x option (where x is the desired new total space in\n  megabytes) allows you to change the capacity of an existing image;\n  this adjusts the logical size of a virtual disk without affecting the\n  physical size much.[37] This currently works only for VDI and VHD\n  formats, and only for the dynamically allocated variants, and can only\n  be used to expand (not shrink) the capacity.\n\nSteps to increase the capacity of disk for Vagrant Base Box\n\n\n*\n\n*To be able to resize the HDD, you'll have to covert it to VDI first, e.g. VBoxManage clonehd in.vmdk out.vdi --format VDI and then re-attached it (using the GUI is easy).\n\n*Resize it using VBoxManage modifyhd box.vdi --resize 15360 which\nincrease the capacity to 15GB.\n\n*However this only changes the drive capacity, you will have to grow the file system for the guest afterwards. For example, use resize2fs -p -F DEVICE for ext4.\n\n\nRefer to the answer here for more details => How can I increase disk size on a Vagrant VM?\n\nA: It seems there is an issue with this specific Vagrant image.

It would start, but then stop after a few rotations of the 'loading' circles. I thought I could just fix it by booting up a Live USB and running boot-repair, but on starting the Live USB, the same thing happened. I went into the BIOS and changed all the UEFI settings and made absolutely sure that UEFI was completely disabled, as per when I installed both Windows and Ubuntu. I tried re-flashing the BIOS and clearing the DMI data pool, removing the GPU and checking to see if it was a driver issue, checking every component that I could, even memorytesting even though Windows 7 still booted up correctly. I tried booting different OSes, such as Fedora and Ubuntu 12.10/13.04, and Debian, but the only OS that worked apart from Windows 7 was Ubuntu 10.04, but understandably (I think) I don't want it. I know it can't be the USB/HD/CDs I'm booting off as I tried many different devices and none worked with newer Linux kernels. I'm also pretty sure that its not GRUB, seeing as GRUB 2 is used in 10.04 as well as 12.04 etc. I'm not a total 'noob' with Ubuntu consoles but I'm still not good, so please try to keep the help simple. Thanks in advance.\n--EDIT--\nI have finally found the issue: it was not a hardware issue or BIOS problem, but the UEFI options in the BIOS that prevented any new version of Linux stop booting, even if you chose the legacy boot option in the boot options. All I had to do was switch to 'Legacy ONLY' in the BIOS settings and they now boot. I still am stumped by why UEFI is supported by 10.04 and possibly other older distros.\n\nA: If you can install Ubuntu 10.04, then install it. After installing it, just upgrade it to the latest distribution version. Try doing this on the terminal after successfully installing Ubuntu 10.04.\nsudo apt-get install update-manager-core\n\nSince Ubuntu 10.04 is an LTS release and I am assuming that you want to install the newest version, you need to edit the release-updates file to reflect the latest dist instead of the LTS (12.04.3) or you may skip this step if you want to use the LTS version.\nsudo vi /etc/update-manager/release-upgrades\n\nChange the line which shows prompt=lts to prompt=normal then upgrade the packages before you run a distribution upgrade.\nsudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get upgrade & sudo apt-get autoremove\n\nAfter everything finishes, issue the following command to the terminal to upgrade to the latest distribution.\nsudo do-release-upgrade\n\nIt should do the trick. However, I am not sure if it is a hardware issue on your side which is causing Grub to act up. You may want to check with your Motherboard Manufacturer about your new BIOS.\n\nA: See my edit in my question. Basically you need to completely disable UEFI and then disable other options that also might prevent Ubuntu from booting, such as Intel Rapid Start Technology.\n", "Q: service vs. initctl Why are some deamons run out of service and some out of initctl?  Do both tools do the same thing and it is just a matter of personal preference of the user what they will use?\nE.g.\nsudo service --status-all\nvs\nsudo initctl list\nIn my particular instance cron runs out of initctl, and ssh runs out of service.  But on Fedora, for example, both of those will be in systemctl.\n\nA: initctl list will show the process managed using upstart native file.\nservice will show those using a more traditional init script.\nsystemctl will show the one using systemd native format. \nUbuntu is migrating from older scripts to upstart jobs and in your case, cron is managed by upstart and ssh is still a regular initscript. Upstart do provides some feature that init script don't ( like automated restarting if the service die, on demand starting, etc ), so packagers are encouraged to migrate to upstart jobs.\nBut in the end, yes, they both do the same basic job of starting the services, but differently, so they are not exactly interchangeable.\n", "Q: CPU frequency scaling issue - scaling_max_freq wrong I have the an issue on my Elitebook Core 2 Duo T9600, the scaling stops to work after few seconds of high load and get stuck at 800Mhz.\nTemperature is around 50-60°C for both cores, bios_limit is reporting the correct max speed 2534000 (2.53Ghz).

When I boot the computer up it goes into the Ubuntu menu and lets me select:\nUbuntu Generic,\nUbuntu recovery,\nprevious versions of linux,\nWindows 8 recovery,\nWindows 8 (loader)\nWhen I select Windows 8 (loader) and Windows 8 recovery selection it gives me an error \" ERROR CANNOT LOCATE DRIVE MAP\" and after pressing the ENTER key it goes back to the menu with all the options to choose from.\nMy friend said that I should just use boot-repair from the terminal and just repair it there... but he has let me down in the past so I just want to make sure that would actually help out more than do harm. It would be greatly appreciated if someone could help me out!\nBoot-repair \nhttp://paste.ubuntu.com/6190163/\nI have a ASUS K55N preloaded with Windows 8 and F2 is BIOS\nWhen I disable \"secure boot\" from the BIOS UBUNTU will not load, but when I enable \"secure boot\" it boots Ubuntu right up. \n\nA: You have a successful install on a secure boot UEFI system.  Things remaining to fix are:\n\n\n*\n\n*Make the EFI partition (sda1) the bootable one instead of sda7.  Although things seem to work anyway much to my surprise.  Use gparted or fdisk to remove the boot flag from sda7 and add it to sda1.\n\n*Fix the Windows chainloader command, it should not be chainloader +1 anymore but something like the below (You MUST use the uuid on your efi partition, which I think I got). Replace the chainloader +1 line.\nsearch --fs-uuid --no-floppy --set=root 02D1-4312\nchainloader (${root})/EFI/Microsoft/Boot/bootmgfw.efi\nEdit the grub.cfg file (change permissions if necessary to make it writable (chmod +w grub.cfg) and replace one of the chainloader +1 lines with the above.  You can then change the permissions back with chmod -w grub.cfg\nboot-repair can do this for you, but if you run it, select what it does rather than a blanket set of mostly unnecessary changes (in your case).\nNOTE, even with the correct chainloader command, some windows machines will still not boot, complaining of cannot load image and giving an error message (bug 1091464).  In that case, you will always have to boot windows through the efi menu (until the bug is f\n\n\n*\n\n*Fix the /etc/grub.d files which build the grub.cfg file (which you could manually edit, but you really don't want to edit it each time you update a kernel).  Again, boot-repair can fix this for you.\n\n\nFor the most part, boot-repair is the fix recommended because there are so many odd situations with different machines.  Just use it selectively, and you should be OK.  Things it does which you do not need would be the renaming of the bootloaders (to fool bad UEFI implementations which only boot files with the windows bootloader name).\nYou should have a function key which gives you the boot selection, so you should not have to go into the BIOS setup each time.\n", "Q: pre-installed apps and Unity Dash are gone so i'm a newbie to Ubuntu..and i have a huge miss happening on my laptop right now \npre-installed apps that came with ubuntu 13.04 were gone (i think something happened while updating them) tweaks and apps like terminal ubuntu software center are gone too so i tried to restart the PC thinking it will solve the problem but it gets worse when now i can't even find the unity dash or the bar on the top..i managed to make a new folder on the desktop and choose a random file and chose to run it with chromium that's and that's how i reached the website....now what do i do ? \n\nA: You may try to delete the Software Centre Cache.

Would this laptop with a 2 GHz dual core processor, 2 gigs of ram, run smoothly, or at least better than Vista. Thanks\n\nA: I made the switch about a year ago. Recently my laptop crashed (bad mobo) and I had the Dell Inspiron 1525 laying around so I decided to give it a shot, mine has (4 gigs of ram and the T8300 Processor). It runs everything fine. Why not just upgrade the ram, it's a cheap upgrade to make. Whether it will run better than Vista is a tough question to answer, but my guess would be yes. Ubuntu seems to run better than any windows platform I have used. I have had a couple of graphics issues, with artifacts on the display, but I am working them out.

I have recently installed Ubuntu 13.04 in my PC. Everything works fine except my Airtel 4G LTE dongle (Model MF825A). Ubuntu does not give any option to select 4G LTE when setting up a mobile broadband connection. \nHow can Airtel 4G LTE (Model MF825A) dongle be used with Ubuntu? Are there any patches or other updates available for getting this problem solved?\n\nA: I spent 1 month figuring out this. Finally found it. It uses a relatively new method to connect to internet. Check my blog post http://krblogs.com/post/62519969772/airtel-4g-lte-on-linux\nCreate a HTML page:\n<form action = \"http://192.168.0.1/goform/goform_set_cmd_process\" method = \"post\">\n <input type=\"checkbox\" name=\"goformId\" value=\"CONNECT_NETWORK\" checked style=\"display:none;\">\n <BUTTON name=\"submit\" type=\"submit\"> Connect </BUTTON>\n</form>\n\n<form action = \"http://192.168.0.1/goform/goform_set_cmd_process\" method = \"post\">\n <input type=\"checkbox\" name=\"goformId\" value=\"DISCONNECT_NETWORK\" checked style=\"display:none;\">\n <BUTTON name=\"submit\" type=\"submit\"> Disconnect </BUTTON>\n</form>\n\nYou are ready to connect\n\nA: As of February 11, 2014, there is no problem at all. I have Ubuntu 13.04 (in one partition) with the latest updates and it's very simple and easy to connect. Just plugin the Airtel 4G LTE dongle and click on the network manager icon in the panel at top right. You should see the modem detected and an option to connect to new mobile broadband network under the Mobile Broadband section. Click on it and follow through the prompts. Select India, Airtel and airtelgprs.com, click finish and you are done. \nI cannot recreate the screen-shot as my connection is setup now, but the screen-shot below will give you an idea of where to go.\n\nNote: Do not use the connection manager from Airtel. It has security issues. If the connection manager is already installed, open terminal and uninstall it as below: \nsudo su\ncd /usr/local/airtel\n./UninstallMobilePartner\n\nA: You may want to check on the model of your Airtel 4G LTE dongle and search for its drivers that are specifically made for Ubuntu.\nIf your modem model is the Huawei E392, there is a known bug on Ubuntu that stops it from working properly. See Here...\n", "Q: Plotting multiple sets of data in libreoffice calc I've a question about libreoffice calc. In this link I have multiple sets of data. I want to plot mass vs volume for each one. I need to plot them all on the same chart/graph.\nI'd appreciate any help or input you guys have to offer.\n\nA: You can do that easily. This is not an ubuntu question though, I think.\nAnyway, in libre-office calc go to \"Insert - Chart\".\nAfter creating a chart (XY (scatter) probably), right click on it and click on \"Data ranges\". A menu will pop out. Go to the tab \"Data series\", and add as many data series as you want. Each data series consists of a graph. Looking at your link, you'll probably want 3 data series, 1 for each solution! The lines will have different colors, and you should edit their legend for easier comprehension.  \n", "Q: New Toshiba Satellite Pro - Ctrl key not working in certain programs I've just bought a new laptop (Toshiba Satellite Pro C50D). As a webdesigner, I use the program Sublime Text and there's a command to expand codes. This command is Ctrl + E. The Ctrl key on my laptop is working fine for other uses (copy/paste for instance) but in this program it doesn't do anything. I know nothing changed in the program itself because I have the same version on my old laptop and Ctrl + E is working fine there.\nWhat I can do to solve this problem (instead of using an external keyboard)\n\nA: Since you have bought a new laptop, then I am assuming you have installed the latest version of Sublime Text. CTRL + E is working, just that your Sublime Text installation is not recognizing it because it is now part of the vintage_ctrl_keys.\nCheck here on how to enable vintage_ctrl_keys -> Enable Vintage Package\n", "Q: Ubuntu 13.4 in virtual machine not showing wlan0 I installed Ubuntu via virtual box in win8.

How can I do this? \nBecause when I was using Ubuntu as dual boot I was using like that. So I am curious to know about it.\n\nA: If you are running Ubuntu on a VirtualBox and you have setup to share the networking, it should use your host's internet connection (regardless if its WIFI/LAN) and either bridge/NAT/etc it to your guest OS which is in your case Ubuntu.\nYour host internet connection is provided by the eth. Naturally, since you are using VirtualBox, it is creating a virtual environment for your host system, in which your guest WLAN is not part of.\n\nA: Accessing your wireless network card functionality is not easy from a guest.\nAs written in the documentation: \"[...] VirtualBox provides up to eight virtual PCI Ethernet cards for each virtual machine. [...]\"\nUsing a WIFI USB dongle may be also a choice wifi-card-on-an-virtualboxs-ubuntu.

I have a maas main server. On that server, I want to host my web application written with java, tomcat and mysql. My maas main server ip address is 192.168.43.191 and dns name is ubuntucloud. So, when I call it from browser like (http: ubuntucloud), I can reach and see \"It's work. This is the default web page for this server. The web server software is running but no content has been added yet\" sentences. I can call my web application like (http:  ubuntucloud:8080/IRMultiAgent/) while running tomcat server in eclipse. I want to call my web app like (http://www.ir_multi_agent/). How to do this? ps: I omit some \"/\" in my post, because of error\n\nA: The simplest way to do this is to add the name ir_multi_agent to your /etc/hosts file. In order to do that, edit that file using sudo vi /etc/hosts or sudo nano /etc/hosts and add the line \n192.168.43.191    ir_multi_agent\n\nFrom then on, you will be able to browse to http://ir_multi_agent:8080/IRMultiAgent and access your application.\nTo get rid of the :8080 in that URL, you have two options: \n\n\n*\n\n*Run Tomcat on the default http port (80) by editing the port number\nin its conf/server.xml file. Note that this requires you to run Tomcat as root.\n\n*Front the Tomcat server with a reverse proxy, which will require installing and configuring an http server such as apache2 or nginx.\n\n\nNow, your URL is down to http://ir_multi_agent/IRMultiAgent. To get rid of the IRMultiAgent context root, you again have two options:\n\n\n*\n\n*Deploy the application as the ROOT web application on Tomcat. That is, put it in the folder webapps/ROOT.\n\n*Use rewrite rules on the reverse proxy.\n\n\nThere you have it, your own webapplication at http://ir_multi_agent/.\nBefore embarking on all this, please consider Shakespeare's wisdom. An URL is but a name.\n\nA: You can configure your Apache web server to forward requests to Tomcat using mod_jk (The Apache Tomcat Connector). Setup an Apache vhost which acts as some kind of proxy to speak to Tomcat and is also able to rewrite the URL. Thus, ubuntucloud:8080/IRMultiAgent/ can be accessed at e.g. irmultiagent.ubuntucloud/ (Smart HowTo)\nSince you already configured the domain ubuntucloud to point to your server, you should be able to also setup such a DNS for ir_multi_agent. Both can point to the same IP. Just make sure to configure the ServerName of the vhosts directives in the Apache configuration correctly.\n", "Q: What unused key combinations are available for use with AutoKey or other apps? I tried setting up a macro using AutoKey and assigned Ctrl+Alt+f8 thinking it probably wouldn't be used for something else. Unfortunately it turned my entire screen black except for a cursor in the top left corner! I found a mention of that function here.\nWhere can I find a list of key combinations that are unused (assuming there are any)?\n\nA: There's a couple of places I can think of to check for used key combinations.\n\n\n*\n\n*If you have dconf-editor installed you could try navigating to org>gnome>desktop>wm>key bindings. \n\n*Another way is through System Settings->Keyboard->Shortcuts, however this groups key combinations by function, such as sound, windows, so it's not as easy to see all the keys in one hit.\n\n\nA: The most useful tool would provide a simple way to list all current keybindings in sorted order.\nThe answer from rods helps a lot!  But dconf-editor doesn't seem to let us export the information, sort it, save it etc.  The gsettings tool accesses the same dconf database from the command line.  So far the best I've found is this:\ngsettings list-recursively | egrep 'keybinding|media-keys'| sort -k 3 | uniq\n\nUnfortunately it doesn't list the Unity bindings, i.e. the ones which are listed by holding down the Super key, like Alt-F10 or Super-A.  And I'm guessing there are more since this is pretty ad-hoc.   And I don't know why it produces duplicates.  I've just removed them via uniq.\nMore insights would be appreciated.

However, in my Ubuntu I can install only version 3.3.1. Is it possible to modify the repositories so that I can install the newest version?\n\nA: \nI started a programming course which requires Python 3.3.2\n\nThe changelog for 3.3.2 shows us that there's no serious work in 3.3.2 over 3.3.1. It's a load of minor bugfixes which won't make any difference for somebody on a programming course.\nThere are big differences between 2.x and 3.x so you will need to install python3.3 and use the python3 binary (you'll have to be conscious about that when you're running examples), but don't worry about being a minor release behind, you're not missing out on anything relevant and it won't affect your coding.\nI would go further and say that if you end up on a repository that gets you a later version, it might not bring in security patches  and you may be vulnerable for longer than you would be with the standard repository.\nThat said, if you really want to upgrade, you should be able to but that comes with the caveat:\n\nI do not guarantee any kind of updates. In particular, I shed all responsibility for security issues in these packages. \n\n", "Q: Why is Steam not able to connect Steam-Network? This is the output when I try to start steam.

Then boot from it.\n", "Q: I have problems installing Ubuntu 13.04 with Wubi on Windows XP I have downloaded an ubuntu-13.04-desktop-i386.iso file, but when I use Wubi to install it in a Windows XP system, the Ubuntu installer program shows: download ubuntu-13.04-desktop-amd64.iso.torrent. It would take about two hours to download it. Why does this happen? It`s a lot of trouble for me.\n\nA: Wubi doesn't support Ubuntu 13.04. See also this post. Ubuntu 12.10 is the last version that could directly be installed with Wubi.\nYou might want to install 12.10 and upgrade. Or just install 13.04 from a bootable DVD and install it on it's own partition.\n\nA: Wubi does not work with Ubuntu 13.04. Although you could just install 12.10 and upgrade, you would probably lose some stability. If you really want cutting edge features, but no risk, you may want to try installing Ubuntu in a virtual machine. Here's a guide on how to get it to work in VirtualBox.\n\nA: There's a bug in Wubi 13.04 where, if you computer supports 64 bit, it cannot find the 32 bit ISO. This is because recently they changed the 64 bit kernel name, and Wubi is looking for that kernel on the ISO and fails to find it.\nTo fix this, run Wubi with the --32bit command line option. Also, make sure you have the 13.04 Wubi.exe and save it in the same directory as the ISO before running (or if you have mounted the ISO, make sure you use the command option --force-wubi or the Install inside windows option is suppressed).\nIf you have issues, check the log file.\n", "Q: Installing applications temporarily I am using Ubuntu 13.10. To post some answers I may need to install some applications which I won't use much. So I would love to install those apps in way that they are gone after a restart.\nHow can I do this? \n\nA: Try overlayfs. I've used it lots of places. Here are the steps to set it up (it's really easy)\nNote: this will sandbox your whole system until you either remove the mount or restart. The way I describe it, it's an all-or-nothing situation. Either you're sandboxing everything (browser history, changed settings, etc.) or nothing at all. If you do some research you might be able to tweak it more to your needs, but give it a try!\nFirst, make the directory to host your sandbox:\nmkdir /tmp/sandbox\n\nNow, mount that bad boy\nsudo mount -t overlayfs -o upperdir=/tmp/sandbox,lowerdir=/ overlayfs /\n\nThat's it! You should now be running a sandboxed machine! When you reboot /tmp/sandbox should be gone.\n", "Q: No previous OS detected when installing Ubuntu 13.04 I am able to try Ubuntu 13.04 using a live usb. However, when I attempt to INSTALL UBUNTU... I am told that no existing OS is detected on the hard drive. \nWhen I get a new laptop, I do intend to format this one and use it purely for Ubuntu. However, in the meantime, I would need the ability to dual boot.\nI do select the other option, to partition the drive... From inside Windows, I had shrank the C: volume and created a new partition w/ 5GB of space (for some reason, I could not shrink it any further although I have 90 GB of free space left)... In Ubuntu, I selected this 5GB volume as reserved bootable BIOS space. \nHowever, when I attempt to continue, I am told that no ROOT file space has been selected. \nDo I need both reserved space for BIOS and ROOT space? Or should I only use the free 5GB for the ROOT space?\n\nA: You do not just need reserved BIOS space for Ubuntu. You should also have at least 10GB of ROOT space. ROOT space is like the C:\\ drive on Windows. It is where Ubuntu is actually installed. This partition will be formatted, so be sure you know what you're doing.\n\nA: You may need to defragment your C: partition and/or temporarily disable the page file in Windows. (Googling on the latter turned up a bunch of pages, most of which said not to disable the page file. That's perfectly good advice for normal conditions, but doing it temporarily may enable you to shrink your C: partition more than you can do it now.) Also, you should NOT create Linux partitions in Windows! You seem to have gotten lucky this time, but creating new partitions in Windows frequently converts all the partitions from \"basic\" to \"dynamic\" form, and Windows dynamic partitions use a proprietary format that makes it difficult or impossible to install Linux on the disk. Thus, whatever you do, DO NOT create more partitions in Windows. If you need to create more partitions, do so using a Linux tool.\nOnce you've freed up more space, you need to use the Linux installer (or a Linux emergency disc and a tool like GParted) to create your Linux partition(s). In the installer, you must mark one partition as the root (/) partition; that's where Linux goes. If nothing is marked as the root (/) partition, it's like telling the moving company you've hired to move all your stuff into the house while you point at an empty field -- they'll scratch their heads and ask what house (root partition) you mean.\nThe default Ubuntu installation uses a root (/) partition and a separate swap partition, the latter being as much RAM as you've got or a bit more. (It's used in suspend-to-disk operations or if you run out of RAM.) I recommend creating a 10-30GiB root (/) partition, swap, and using the rest as a separate /home partition. If you want to give Linux less than 20-30GiB, though, a separate /home partition may not make much sense. The advantage of a separate /home partition is that it keeps your user data separate from the OS data. This can simplify certain types of disaster recovery and re-installation scenarios.\n", "Q: Authentication required by wireless network appears multiple times Sometimes when I don't use my Ubuntu for a long time - maybe a day, I can see the popup showing\n\nAuthentication required by wireless network\n\nThere's obviously some wireless connects and disconnects.

Your problem may not be the filesystem used on the MicroSD card, it is a multitude of reasons that goes from your HDD performance, memory, cache, USB/MicroSD interface, CPU, etc. Meaning that it depends greatly in what your system general performance rather that a peculiar filesystem.\nYou instead of looking for ways to trying to reach the peak 10MB/s that the MicroSD card offers (again they say maximum speed not fixed speed, since it can be less at any given time) I would look for a process using the I/O, CPU, cache.

It should then look like this:\nPROMPT='\n%(1V.(%1v).)%{$fg_bold[grey]%}[%{$reset_color%}%{$fg_bold[${host_color}]%}%n@%m%{$reset_color%}%{$fg_bold[grey]%}]%{$reset_color%} %{$fg_bold[blue]%}%10c%{$reset_color%} $(git_prompt_info) $(git_remote_status)\n%{$fg_bold[cyan]%}❯%{$reset_color%} '\n\nIf you want some color you could add %(1V.%{$fs_bold[yellow]%}(%1v)%{$reset_color%}.) for example.\nExplanation:\nvirtenv_indicator will be called each time before the prompt is created. It checks if $VIRTUAL_ENV is set and not empty. If so, it sets the first element of the $psvar array to $VIRTUAL_ENV with everything before and including the last / removed (like basename $VIRTUAL_ENV but less expensive)\nIn the definition of PROMPT %(1V.(%1v).) checks if the first element of $psvar is set and not empty (%(1V.true-text.false-text)) and adds the content of the this element plus some parentheses ((%1v))\nexport VIRTUAL_ENV_DISABLE_PROMPT=yes disables any prompt setting by bin/activate scripts.\n\nA: Oh-my-zsh now includes a virtualenv plugin, so just enable it in the config.\n\nA: If you're using prezto, you can find instructions on how to display the active virtualenv here: https://github.com/sorin-ionescu/prezto/tree/master/modules/python#theming\n", "Q: trackpad gestures Does any one knows a application to detect the multitouch of a laptop and use it to do gestures like macOSX.\nSlide sideways with 3 fingers to change virtual desktops\nMove upwards with 3 fingers to do a exposé\nMove downwards with 3 fingers to show desktop\nConfigure other gestures that I might need\n\nA: Easystroke is a gesture-recognition application for X11.

The language used is a bit above my head though and some steps seem to be skipped for the non ubuntu endowed minds.\nSo very simply, I am starting right at the partition option in the installer, where I click \"something else\" instead of erasing the whole disk (because I want to keep windows 8 as well). Now I have read that you can only have one UEFI partition. Great. Sounds good. Now do I also need a partition for installing linux with the ext3/4, or do I do as one guide said and format it in fat32?\nI am lost at this point. Then it goes on talking about boot flagging and how only the UEFI partition needs to be boot flagged. So here is where my dummy-ness kicks in and I am lost. I am looking for very specific instructions on how not to totally screw up the booting and install a dual-boot ubuntu/windows 8 system.\n\nA: Actually partitioning for an EFI-based Ubuntu installation is no harder than partitioning for a BIOS-based installation. If you've read a guide to Ubuntu installation or partitioning, the changes for an EFI-based installation are:\n\n\n*\n\n*You generally use the GUID Partition Table (GPT) for EFI rather than the older Master Boot Record (MBR). On a system with Windows already installed, this should already be done, and the Ubuntu installer will detect and use the GPT partitions just fine. Using GPT does have some further implications, though, as detailed below....\n\n*GPT doesn't use extended or logical partition types. Instead, GPT supports up to 128 (by default; that limit can be raised) partitions. Some tools refer to these as \"primary partitions,\" although in the absence of extended and logical partition types, the designation \"primary\" is meaningless. The point of all this is that you can ignore any instructions to create an extended partition or to create a certain mix of primary and logical partitions.\n\n*The current version of Ubuntu has a bug that causes it to use the Windows filesystem type code for Linux partitions. This causes your Ubuntu filesystem partition(s) to show up in Windows as unpartitioned disks. The solution is to use gdisk to change the type code of your Ubuntu filesystem partition(s) from 0700 to 8300. This problem is covered in more detail on this page. You can make this change after installing Ubuntu.\n\n*GPT doesn't use cylinder/head/sector (CHS) values. Older documentation may refer to this, or to \"cylinder alignment.\" Ignore such references. (You might also look for newer documentation, since CHS issues are obsolete even for new installations on BIOS-based computers.)\n\n*An EFI-based installation stores its boot loader in the EFI System Partition (ESP) rather than in the MBR. Thus, you must have an ESP, which the Ubuntu installer refers to an an \"EFI boot partition.\" If the computer already boots another OS in EFI mode, it will already have an ESP. I recommend backing up any existing ESP before you proceed, just in case of an accident. (A file-level backup should work fine.) On a system with Windows 8 pre-installed, the ESP is usually one of the first three partitions on the disk. It always uses a FAT (usually FAT32) filesystem, so you can identify it in this way on the partitioning screen. In GParted or parted it will have its \"boot flag\" set, and in gdisk it will have a type code of EF00.\n\n\nOther partitioning issues are common across firmware and partition table types. In particular, Ubuntu defaults to using two partitions: One for the root (/) filesystem and another for swap space. Many users like to split off /home or other directories into their own partitions, and some like to use Logical Volume Manager (LVM) setups. The issues related to such things are the same for EFI and GPT as they are for MBR and BIOS, so refer to any of the hundreds of sites that cover such issues.\n\nA: How I installed my system, but I have secure boot off in bios, so I am not sure that it will work:\n\n\n*\n\n*Create new partition table on your hard disk in GPT mode. (Warning: this will erase all data on the disk!) Then you must create a 100 MB fat32 partition labeled 'EFI' and flagged 'boot'. and the system partitions, so:\n\n\n*\n\n*sda1: 100mb, fat32, EFI, boot flag set\n\n*sda2: 30gb, ext4, kali-linux\n\n*sda3: 4gb, swap, swap for kali&ubuntu\n\n*sda4: 60gb, ext4, ubuntu\n\n*sda5: 250gb, ntfs, windows 8.1\n\n*sda6: 382gb, ntfs, datas\n\n\n*(optional) Install Kali-linux, While installing make sure to mount the 100 MB fat32 as /boot/efi. Do the rest as usual.\n\n*Install Windows 8. It will automatically identify the EFI system partition, create a MSFTRES, and a NTFS where it installs itself. After installation we can only boot into Windows, but we will fix that later.\n\n*Ubuntu, while installing select the 100 MB fat32 and change it into 'use as efi'. Create an ext4, install Ubuntu. Upon rebooting we are presented with win8 loader.\nin bootmenu choose ubuntu end get into it.\n\n*Now we will configure GRUB2 to detect Windows. open a root nautilus, navigate to /boot/efi/EFI delete the boot folder and copy the boot folder from the microsoft folder to the windows partition and after delete the microsoft folder. Aft r go to /etc/default/grub and comment out the 2 line start with \"GRUB_HIDDEN\".\nNext, the entry for windows can be manually added by appending the following lines to /etc/grub.d/40_custom:\nmenuentry \"Windows\" {\n        search --fs-uuid --no-floppy --set=root YOUR-EFI-PARTITIONS-UUID-HERE\n        chainloader (${root})/Boot/bootmgfw.efi\n}\n\nAnd finally type sudo update-grub. Welcome in the working system.\n\nA: Partitioning is the very easy part. For all the partitioning tasks you should use a partitioning software like GParted which ships with the Ubuntu Live ISO image. A tool like the Ubuntu installer, which oversimplifies things, is probably the main reason why you're confused.\nFor proper EFI partitioning and installing you need to:\n\n\n*\n\n*Have a GPT partition table on the hard drive you want to install to.\n\n\n*\n\n*You can verify this in GParted via menu entries View -> Device Information. If the partition table attribute reads msdos instead of gpt, then it's wrong and might get messy if you continue. Unfortunately creating a new partition table destroys the existing one and all data on the disk.\n\n*Related: How can I check and change the partition table type?\n\n\n*Have a EFI system partition (ESP).\n\n\n*\n\n*A EFI system partition has the partition type ef00 and usually contains a FAT32 file system.\n\n*Given that you have a GPT partition table, if the checkbox for boot is ticked in GParted's manage flags dialog on the partition that is meant to be your ESP and the partition contains a FAT32 file system everything is good. If not tick the checkbox for boot and ensure that none of the other partitions has this flag set, because as you already found out, there can only be one ESP. (Yes, the boot flag in GParteds GUI equals partition type ef00, however this is not the real GUID used in GPT for the ESP, see Wikipedia for a list of partition type GUIDs and the comment below by user Rod Smith, and also the footnote in the article about manufacturer specific boot partitions.)\n\n\n*Create the remaining partitions needed for the OS and boot the installation media in UEFI mode.\n\n\n*\n\n*Your proper partition setup is almost complete. Just add the partitions you want for your new OS installation as you see fit. You can do this via the Ubuntu installer or GParted, it's up to you and you can't do much wrong here. (The de facto default file system for Linux is EXT4. You can't install to FAT32, because due to this file systems limited feature set.)\n\n*If you haven't booted the installation media in UEFI mode, you need to reboot and explicitly boot in UEFI mode. UEFI needs to be enabled in you computers firmware setup screen (formerly/usually called BIOS). Instructions on how to boot and verify that the installation media booted in UEFI mode can be found in the community documentation. From there on the Ubuntu installer should know that it should do a UEFI installation.\n\n*Secure boot should work with Ubuntu 12.10 64-bit and 12.04.2 64-bit and newer installation media (see: How do I install Ubuntu alongside a pre-installed Windows with UEFI?).\n\n\n\nYou can do UEFI installations on MBR partitioned disks and do certain hacks/kludges, but a setup verified to be like this will give you the least amount of trouble and everything should work fine. I found the Arch Linux UEFI wiki page very detailed and helpful for learing more on the whole topic and doing some hacks.\n\nKnown UEFI bugs and implementation shortcomings:\n\n\n*\n\n*Wikipedia about Lenovo, Toshiba, Samsung without going into much detail.\n\n*Computers from 2011 or earlier may feature a UEFI firmware, but the implementation may not always provide a UEFI boot interface.

Thanks.\n\nA: To run fsck on your harddrive you need to boot a liveCD and then run the commands with your harddrive partitions as the target. \n\n\"There is no /forcefsck file in my root\"\n\n-You need to create the file, it is just a blank file so run sudo touch /forcefsck and fsck will check your drive next time your reboot.\n\nA: I concur with @bodhi.zazen comment here. The best way to go about checking a filesystem is to boot from live media, choose \"Try Ubuntu\" and then manually fsck the partition in question. For example sudo fsck /dev/ZdXY where ZdXY is the partition in question. sudo fdisk -l will give you a listing of your drives and the partitions on them. This information should be sufficient for you to determine which partition you need to check.\n\nA: In addition to what other answers said, I would also point out that normally, if the root filesystem wasn't cleanly unmounted, if you just reboot, it will be automatically fsck'ed, when that status is detected during mounting.\n", "Q: How do I install Ubuntu 12 with a USB WiFi adapter?

Maybe this is helpful for somebody facing the same problem.\n\nA: Kernel panic can mean many things. My guess is you made some mistake during installation, related to formatting the drive.\nHere is a guide on Kernel boot parameters and how to enter them dynamically when booting via grub.\n\nA: I had same problem with kubuntu 14.04 install. I tried a number of times and got kernel panic - no init each time. The problem (I think) was some left over files (from previous crunchbang install) on the bootable USB created with unetbootin. After reformatting the USB stick and redoing unetbootin iso > USB, everything went OK on next install.\n\nA: I had the same problem. Thanks to @Lawrie's answer I figured out why this happened:\nWhile making the bootable USB, I had not previously formatted the USB and Unetbootin mixed somehow the files, allowing me to boot as a live USB and even go through the whole installation process without any error message (that's why I did not think about it), but not properly installing it at the end.\nJust make sure to format the USB prior to using Unetbootin or use another software (maybe that is the problem). That worked for me. Also try another .iso or another distribution and see if you get the same problem.\n\nA: This may help others with this problem.\nI discovered it was caused by a problem extracting the .zip that contained the .img file.\nCame across some signs of this when I looked at the file system and noticed files were missing.\nSo to fix the problem, I fired up terminal to extract the former .zip file from there and re-created the image via dd in terminal and it worked.\n", "Q: Incomplete file transfers to USB drive with Nautilus Sometimes when I copy or move some files to my USB drive Nautilus says the transfer is completed but when I unplug the USB drive and plug it back in again the file that I copied or moved is not there.

This principle is true with all OS. Use the eject feature or on the command line, \nsync\n\n\nA: Always eject the USB device properly before removing it: in Nautilus press the eject symbol next to it, or on the desktop right click it and select Eject.\n\nA: This is not a Nautilus fault for sure.

To see them for the mount command you would enter (same way for any command):\n\nman mount\n\n\nA: Although the question is 2 years old at this time, this answer is provided for completeness.\nIn my experience, this was a hardware issue. Physically changing the SATA port on the motherboard to which the DVD drive was connected solved this issue, namely, an Ubuntu release upgrade causing a previously working DVD drive to fail to be recognized in the new installation.  I do not presently know if this is due to Ubuntu not recognizing the device properly due to some bug, or if it's a fault in my motherboard.\nMore detail: I recently upgraded (to 16.04 from 14.04) and faced a similar problem: a previously working DVD drive stopped working.  The DVD SATA cable happened to be connected to the SATA05 port on my motherboard.  This worked fine in 14.04.  After upgrading, it stopped working, and I fixed the problem by:\n\n\n*\n\n*shutting down my machine (don't forget to unplug it and then tap the power button once to discharge components, preventing electrostatic shock to yourself and damage to your machine)\n\n*physically moving the DVD SATA cable to a different SATA port, preferably with a lower number (SATA01 in my case), if one is available.\n\n*rebooting (don't forget to re-plug in the power cable)\n\n*Enter the BIOS setup (usually by tapping F2 or F1 during boot on most PCs. Look at the screen during boot and it may make a recommendation, or Google it on another machine, referencing your computer brand & model, if you can't figure out the key on your own) and make sure the new SATA port that you just used for the DVD drive is enabled or \"on.\"\n\n\nAfter this procedure, my DVD drive worked perfectly in the new installation, including being automatically mounted and visible in the desktop environment.\nNote: upgrading from a LTS release to a non-LTS release, such as from 12.04 LTS to 13.04, as the OP did, instead of going between LTS releases, carries a higher risk of bugs and associated troubleshooting.\n", "Q: sudo: grub-setup: command not found I'm installing windows along with Ubuntu 13.

I have Ubuntu Server 12 and I've installed Samba and CUPS.  I have also downloaded and installed the drivers for my printer.  At this point, I'm unsure of how to actually go about and install and configure the printer.  The printer is a Canon ip3600, which doesn't have support per se, but there were third-party drivers which I unpacked, modified according to the instructions, and installed.  I have the printer plugged into the server via a USB.  After googling I still haven't found instructions on installing the printer itself, though I have found plenty on configuring Samba and CUPS.  How do I go about the actual installation and configuration of the printer itself?  Thanks!\n\nA: First, look to see if you have the necessary packages installed correctly with the service running:\n\ndpkg -l cups\nservice cups status\n\nIf CUPS is not running start it.  Here is the command to install it and an offical CUPS link:\n\nsudo apt-get install cups\n\nhttps://help.ubuntu.com/10.04/serverguide/cups.html\n\nIf you have the GUI (desktop environment) installed on your server, simply enter this into Firefox as a URL to configure it:\n\nhttp://localhost:631\n\nIf not, I'd recommend accessing the printer from another computer's web browser.  By default, network access is denied, so you'll need to allow another computer by IP address.  To do this, modify the configuration file to \"Listen\" to the other computer's IP address:\n\nvim /etc/cups/cupsd.conf\n\nFinally, configure the printer from the other computer by using the Ubuntu Server's IP address instead of localhost, like this:\n\nhttp://192.168.0.3:631\n\nCredit: https://www.linux.com/community/forums/printers/installing-hp-printer-in-ubuntu-1104-server\nHere are a couple more links if you need them:\n\nhttps://help.ubuntu.com/community/NetworkPrintingWithUbuntu\n\nhttp://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=310450\n", "Q: Wildcards in gedit Is there a way to use wildcards in gedit's search and replace function? I really don't want to have to install anything or try or have to figure out how to use a 3rd party plugin—I installed the advanced find and replace plugin, yet there is absolutely zero information on how to use the thing.\n\nA: Taking your question literally, there is a ridiculous/extreme way to enable wildcards without installing any additional plugins.\n\n\n*\n\n*First, go to edit/preferences/plugins and enable the python\nconsole. This plugin should be installed by default.\n\n*Hit ctrl-f9 to open the bottom panel and expose the console\n\n*Paste the following code into the console and hit enter:\n#function to replace stuff\nimport re\ndef replace(re1,re2):\n    doc = window.get_active_document()\n    start, end = doc.get_bounds()\n    txt = start.get_slice(end)      \n    newtxt = re.sub(re1,re2,txt)    \n    doc.set_text(newtxt)\n\n\n*For demo purposes, paste the above code into your gedit document\n\n*Now, from the console, you can use regular expressions with wildcards like so: replace(r'function.*',r'new comment')\nPretty fun, right? :)\n", "Q: Schedule task to close I want to schedule transmission to close at a certain time every day in Gnome Schedule task.

I have read through probably two-dozen posts and articles, and still can't seem to find an answer.  I have installed OpenJDK-7 and am trying to set it as the default to open .jar files (specifically, I'm trying to set it as the default for minecraft.jar, freshly downloaded from the minecraft.org site).\nI am running the 64-bit version of Ubuntu 13.04 (fresh install), and installed OpenJDK through the Software Center.  Everything looks to be fine, OpenJDK shows up in the /usr/share/applications directory.  If I right-click on minecraft.jar I see \"OpenJDK Java 7 Runtime\" as an option under the \"Open With\" context menu.  That's fine.  It launches the minecraft launcher, checks for updates, and I can fire up the game.  The problem is, if I go to \"Properties\" and then to the \"Open With\" tab, OpenJDK is nowhere to be found in the list of options.  I want to set it up as the default for .jar files so I can set up a launcher to drop into the unity launcher.\nI have also used gedit in a terminal window to change the \"defaults.list\" file in the /applications directory to use openjdk-7-java.desktop for both jar and java-archive.\nNo matter what I try, the outcome is always the same: I can launch it if I right-click > open with > OpenJDK...     but I cannot set OpenJDK as the default for .jar files.\n\nA: I don't know how to add the option in the tab of the Open With menu. \nBut to create a shortcut for the dash, you can use the alacarte application. \n\nThen, you could drag-and-drop the shorcut to add it to your main menu.\n\nA: If You have Ubuntu Tweak, you can create asociation in card File Types Manager\nSelect line \"Archive Java\" and change the record by double click:\nAdd > Use own command > type \"/usr/bin/java -jar \" and press enter.\nAfter that you can easily run java app by double-clicking on it.\nHappy clicking!\n", "Q: Flash Drive Issue So I used Startup Disk Creator on Ubuntu 13.04.

A file named ootputs is then created which I cannot open.\nIs there anyway to retrieve the data inside the file?\nMany thanks.\nWenxu\n\nA: Unfortunately, when the target for the mv command is not an existing directory, it renames the source file as the target; when used within a find command, that means each successive file that matches the predicate will overwrite the previous one. So in your case, the ./ooutputs file will now contain only the contents of the last .mat file that was matched. To avoid accidents like this it's good practice to always include a trailing slash character when you are moving files to a new directory i.e.\nfind . -name '*.mat' -exec mv {} ./ooutputs/ \\;\nsince this will throw an error if /ooutputs is not in fact an existing directory.

Use the below examples to update your repositories and then install vim.\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get install vim\n\nOn the off chance that you use vi or vim only when searching on the internet how to fix something and you happen to forget to type vim, there is one way that you can fix it for the future. I caution you to pay attention. You can use an alias to overwrite vi with a reference to vim so that no matter what you type in the infrequent future, you get vim without that \"oops!\" moment. You can always delete an alias later.\nType vim .bashrc. Move down to the empty line with only a ~ (or to any other line that starts with alias (so they're grouped together) and then press the i key to enter -insert- mode. On its own separate line, enter the following:\nalias vi='vim'\n\nPress Esc and then type :wq. Now you need to reload the file. Type source .bashrc Any other shell that opens after you have made these edits will automatically load the .bashrc file.\n\nA: This can also be due to the TERM variable; set it for example like this:\nexport TERM=xterm\n\n\nA: All the explanations given are a bit bizarre. I have vi but not vim installed. \nChecking alternatives: /etc/alternatives/vi &rightarrow; /usr/bin/vim.tiny\nSo vi is vim.tiny, and it uses /etc/vim/vimrc.tiny.\nAnd in vimrc.tiny you find the following line:\nset compatible\n\nWhich is almost the only thing in this file. Note that in /etc/vim/vimrc it is using nocompatible.\nSo either install vim, or change the vimrc.tiny file, or create your own ~/.vimrc which should contain the line:\nset nocompatible\n\n\nA: If you don't already have a .vimrc file in your home directory, create one using this:\nvim ~/.vimrc\n\nAdd this line to the top of the file:\nset nocompatible\n\nSave the file and this should fix the problem for you. :)\n\nA: With vi, when pressing i you activate the command to Insert text.\nThis command allows you to insert text in your file. \nAnd right, when:\n\n*\n\n*pressing ↑ it will insert a \"A\",\n\n*pressing ↓ it will insert a \"B\",\n\n*...\nTill you deactivate this command.\nTo deactivate a command in vi: just press Esc\nAnd then you will get back normal use of your arrow keys:\n\n*\n\n*↑ to go up,\n\n*↓ to go down,\n\n*...\n\n\nFYI, here are some vi commands:\nFrom this source.\n:xReturn quit vi, writing out modified file to file named in original invocation\n:wqReturn quit vi, writing out modified file to file named in original invocation\n:qReturn quit (or exit) vi\n:q!Return quit vi even though latest changes have not been saved for this vi call\n↓ move cursor down one line\n↓ move cursor up one line\n← move cursor left one character\n→ move cursor right one character\nu undo whatever you just did; a simple toggle\n. redo whatever you just did\ni insert text before cursor, until Esc hit\nI insert text at beginning of current line, until Esc hit\na append text after cursor, until Esc hit\nA append text to end of current line, until Esc hit\no open and put text in a new line below current line, until Esc hit\nO open and put text in a new line above current line, until Esc hit\nr replace single character under cursor (no Esc needed)\ncw change the current word with new text,starting with the character under cursor, until Esc hit\nx delete single character under cursor\nNx delete N characters, starting with character under cursor\ndw delete the single word beginning with character under cursor\nC change (replace) the characters in the current line, until Esc hit\nD delete the remainder of the line, starting with current cursor position\ndd delete entire current line\nNdd delete N lines, beginning with the current line;  e.g., 5dd deletes 5 lines\nyy copy (yank, cut) the current line into the buffer\nNyy copy (yank, cut) the next N lines, including the current line, into the buffer\np paste the line(s) in the buffer into the text after the current line\n0 (zero) move cursor to start of current line (the one with the cursor)\n$ move cursor to end of current line\nw move cursor to beginning of next word\nb move cursor back to beginning of preceding word\n:0Return or 1G move cursor to first line in file\n:nReturn or nG move cursor to line n\n:$Return or G move cursor to last line in file\n/string search forward for occurrence of string in text\n?string search backward for occurrence of string in text\nn move to next occurrence of search string\nN move to next occurrence of search string in opposite direction\n\nA: To disable printing letters on pressing arrows in edit mode you can do following\nvi $HOME/.exrc \n\n(create file if it does not exist) and then add line set nocompatible to it and save.\n\nA: On some systems, the nocompatible option is not available, or it may not fix the problem if a plugin breaks arrow key functionality. Here's a workaround...\nEdit the .exrc file to include the following lines:\nmap! ^[OA ^[ka\nmap! ^[OB ^[ja\nmap! ^[OC ^[la\nmap! ^[OD ^[ha\n\nOr, if the problem only exists in normal mode, you can change to nmap and skip the following a, as follows:\nnmap! ^[OA ^[k\n\nand so on.\nHere's the key combinations needed to produce them (showing first one only):\nmap! <CTRL-V><Up-Arrow> <CTRL-V><ESC>ka\n\nThis escapes edit mode, moves in the wanted direction, and reenters edit mode. This is needed to overcome Vi reading the escape sequence as a sequence of literal <ESC><O><A>, etc. \nSource: https://hea-www.harvard.edu/~fine/Tech/vi.html\n\nA: For VI create or edit the file \"~/.exrc\" or VIM create or edit the file \"~/.vimrc\" set or add in the line.\nset nocompatible\n\nAt the time of this writing there are commends on  the second most voted item that are wondering why their entry was not accepted. The reason is there are hosts that do not allow installing other editors. Even then vim sometimes has the same effects, so there is a bunch of usable info from the top two entries. I cannot comment however hopefully this clears up reasons why neither one is 100% correct 100% of the time.\n\nA: Installing the vim package will fix the problem:\nsudo apt-get install vim\n\nThere are many good vim/vi tutorials on YouTube, or the web generally.\nFor your problem, see the article 8 Essential Vim Editor Navigation Fundamentals.\nThen continue to open files as usual:\nvi desired-file\n\n\nA: There are three modes in vi editor namely: \n\n\n*\n\n*command mode\n\n*input mode\n\n*default mode.\n\n\nWhen youu open a file, you are in default mode. Now if you want to go to a specific position in your text, just use arrow keys or use h, j, k, l keys. Note that this would work only when you have not pressed i (or any other input mode entering command like a, A, I).\nThe reason for 'B' may be because the arrow keys in input mode don't function as arrow keys, so just press Esc to go into default mode any time. When to shift to input mode press i or a, and to navigate just press i key and use arrow keys or h, j, k, l.\n\nA: The traditional vi editor doesn't recognize the arrow keys (...afair). There are two solutions:\n\n\n*\n\n*use vim instead of vi\n\n*use h, j, k and l to navigate (you can't navigate while editing on the traditional vi btw.)\n\n\nA: This may happen because Vim received no (or wrong) information about the terminal you are using and therefore can't recognise the key presses correctly.\nSince Vim tries to get this information from the TERM variable, this could be fixed by running\nexport TERM=linux\n\nbefore starting Vim.\nThis is similar to Jasper Nuyens's answer about setting it to xterm. xterm, xterm-color, and xterm-256color relate to graphical terminal programs. linux is the terminal type set in virtual consoles and is worth trying if you're not in a graphical terminal, or if xterm was already set or otherwise not effective.\n\nA: On this machine I had to make sure that \nset nocompatible\n\nis the last entry in ~/.vimrc. Or at least one of the last entries, in particular no more plugin is loaded afterwards.\nHTH\n\nA: For some reason, Ubuntu has omitted initialising envvar HOME for user root on my new 18.04 VPS. If that is the case, vi cannnot find the .vimrc file. The problem does not occur for normal users (in /home/).\nTo check the variable:\necho $HOME\n\nIf this results in a blank line, the variable is not set. The problem went away after\nexport HOME=/root\n\nI moved the command into the /root/.bashrc file (I don't know where this is usually set).\n\nA: I would recommend trying out gvim.\nsudo apt install vim-gtk3\n\nGvim adds a graphical user interface on top of vim, and it does provide a proper cursor by default as well.\n", "Q: FAX / Ubuntu interface Is there a way to have access from Ubuntu 12.04 (LibreOffice Writer OR other) to an Epson Stylus NX305 FAX?\nThe FAX machine has a PSTN (Public Switched Telephone Network) port and a USB (Universal Serial Bus) port and works well as a stand alone FAX (facsimile) using the PSTN port for both incoming and outgoing FAX. I would like to be able to send FAX requests directly from the computer so I do not need to take the extra steps to print and scan the outgoing FAX. It would also be nice to divert incoming FAX so they need not be scanned to save the FAX on the computer.\nPrint and scan work well, but it would be nice to save ink in printing the FAX. Most of the companies with which I deal have FAX which makes it a more secure option than email and a lot faster than a courier service like USPS (United States Postal Service), UPS (United Parcel Service), FedEx (Federal Express), etc.\n\nA: First of all, fax is far less secure than email. Never transmit any private or secure information over a fax. Anybody can walk right outside your building to the TNI box and get all of your faxes.\nIf you are looking for a solution for interfacing fax with your computer, you have a few options.\n\n\n*\n\n*You could buy a fax modem for your computer and hook up the line to it.\n\n*You could port your fax number to an online fax service provider.\n\n*You could port your fax number to a SIP provider and build your own fax interface using asterisk and spandsp.\n\n", "Q: Copy & Paste between terminal(s) and application windows in i3 I have recently installed the i3 tiling window manager [1] on my Ubuntu system and I'm trying to figure out how to copy & paste between various terminal and application windows.\nHow can this be done?\n[1] http://i3wm.org\n\nA: I have just had success using the middle mouse button with xterm in i3 to copy from a remote terminal to firefox. Use the middle mouse button to copy and paste.\n\nA: You have had good answers above, I will just add a detail. As a default, the clipboard of each container is emptied when the container is closed. So if you copy some text from a terminal, close the terminal, and paste the text in another terminal - it will not work, because the clipboard will have been emptied in the meanwhile.\n\nA: I installed xfce4-terminal which pretty much does exactly what I need.\nsudo apt-get install xfce4-terminal\n\n\nA: Some terminals use CTRL+SHIFT+C and CTRL+SHIFT+V to copy and paste, while others use CTRL+ALT+C and CTRL+ALT+V, like urxvt (See https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Rxvt-unicode#Cut_and_paste ).\nFor i3wm, try using a clipboard manager, like clipit.\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get install clipit\n\nAdd exec --no-startup-id clipit to ~/.i3/config to start it automatically.\n\nA: I don't use that myself, but your copy buffer might be accessible through ctrl +shift+c to copy and v to paste. These is also programs like xclipboard for capturing output of terminal commands into a clipboard. Try it out, report back!\n\nA: I just got mine done by holding down Ctrl+mouse wheel. Then selecting from the popup that comes the option: Select to clipboard by moving the mouse to that option and releasing the mouse wheel. Then I went ahead and selected the text I wanted to copy in the terminal and it worked.\nThis was done in i3 wm\n", "Q: Hidden Startup Applications I don't use things like Ubuntu One.

Thence, you can access it with the same url in your specified port. \nAlso., I remember configuring Apache to Listen in 8080 and Varnish in 80 with drupal and other php applications.

Even after 2 versions(12.10;13.04), this recommendation remains valid.My questions are: how can you compare the two versions(12.04 & 13.10 ) to know if it is right to migrate to 13.10.\n If we find that the latest version is stable,this criterion may be sufficient for Ubuntu 13.10 migration. What are the new features of Ubuntu 13.10\n\nA: In my opinion the main reason would be to have a newer version of software without the hassle with ppa's. there are some small changes in the launcher but for me that would not be enough to update. also keep in mind that 14.04 again is a long therm support version, this is half a year away and LTS versions in general are more stable, if you can do without the newer versions of software I would wait with upgrading till 14.04.\n", "Q: During install, not partitioning correctly I'm trying to install the latest 64-bit build of Ubuntu (13.04).

If you double click the file in Windows, it will open your default browser to the indicated URL.\nHere is an example of *.url file content:\n[InternetShortcut]\nURL=http://abdennour-insat.blogspot.com/\n\nWhen the same file is copied on Ubuntu OS, Ubuntu handles it such as a text file. Hence, the browser does not open the URL when double-clicking the file.\nMy question is: what is the equivalent of *.url file in Linux to make shortcut file for URLs?\n\nA: You can make your Linux file manager open .URL file in your default browser. This is particularly useful for people who share files between Windows and *nix machines. To do this create a script file let's call it mswin-urlfile (or what ever you like) in /usr/local/bin (or your preferred folder). Change permission: chmod +x /usr/local/bin/mswin-urlfile\n#!/usr/bin/bash\nif [ \"$1\" == \"\" ] || [ \"$1\" == \"--help\" ] ; then\n  echo \"$(basename \"$0\") URLFILE - opens a .url file in the default browser\"\nelse\n  sed 's/^BASEURL=/URL=/' \"$1\" | grep -m 1 '^URL=' | sed 's/^URL=//' | sed 's/\\r//' | xargs xdg-open\nfi\n\nTo test use it manually from a shell prompt using:\nmswin-urlfile test.url\n\nNext you will need to configure file manager to call mswin-urlfile when opening a .URL file type. This works across all *nix and shells allowing you to open your .URL files from within your file manager. Exactly how to do this depends on the file manager you use. Lookup \"file association\" for the specific file manager you use.\nFor example Nautilus file manager is mentioned at 369967 and create a mimetype for the .url extension\n\nOpen Applications > System Tools > File Types Editor, and click the New button. Enter the following information in the corresponding tabs:\n► General:\nCategory: Text and source code\nName: x-url\nDescription: Microsoft Internet Explorer Shortcut\nYou can choose an icon for the .url file-type via the browse button […] – if you don’t have any, there are some at the bottom of this post that you can save to a folder like /home/yourusername/Settings/Icons.\n► Filenames:\nFilename pattern: *.url\n► File contents:\nWhen you click +Add, you’ll see more than one data entry field, but all you need to worry about is the Value: one.\nValue: [InternetShortcut]\nNow your system knows what .url files are, but it still doesn’t know what to do with them. You now have to associate the .url extension with the executable script fx-url, so right-click any .url file and go to Properties > Open With.  Click the Add button, and at the bottom of the “Add Application“ window you’ll see the “Use a custom command“ option; click this, then either browse to /user/bin and select the symlink you created, or enter /usr/bin/Web Shortcut Browser (or the appropriate name if you changed it). Click the Add button to save your changes (but leave the “Properties“ window open as you’ll need it in the next step).\nNow you need to make the associated action the default option for double-clicking, otherwise you’ll have to right-click .url files and choose the required option from the context menu. To make opening in Firefox the default action, in the Open With tab of  the “Properties“ window, click the dot to the left of the entry you just added (eg: “Web Shortcut Browser“), then click Close.\nopen any Nautilus (file manager) window and go to Edit > Preferences > Behaviour. In the “Executable Text Files“ section, make sure that “View executable text files when they are opened“ is selected. Click Close, and it is done (you may need to log out or reboot for the changes to take effect). Now when you right-click any .url file, you should see “Open with Web Shortcut Browser“ as the top entry of the context menu, and it will be the default action for double-clicks.\n\nI use a different file manager so I have not tested the above Nautilus instructions.\nI prefer to keep using URL files as I use a mixed environment Android + app to open or create URL files; Linux + script (above) to open URL files; Windows (built in URL file support). Alternatively, you could convert every system to just use bookmark files and sync them, but builtin browser syncing has messed up my bookmarks more than once. If you use different browsers (eg Chrome, Firefox, Brave) on different system syncing is not simple.\n\nA: In Ubuntu an URL shortcut is stored in a .desktop file as follow (for example):\n[Desktop Entry]\nEncoding=UTF-8\nName=Link to Best Practices Software engineering\nType=Link\nURL=http://abdennour-insat.blogspot.com/\nIcon=text-html\n\nIf you still want to open your Windows URL files in Ubuntu, here is described how you can do it:\n\n\n*\n\n*How to Open .url Internet Explorer Shortcuts in Ubuntu Using Firefox.\n\n\nThe Perl script given in that article appears to be broken, but the following code should do the same thing correctly:\n#!/usr/bin/perl\n# Script to make Microsoft Windows Internet Shortcuts (*.url) work on Linux.\n\nmy $browser = 'sensible-browser';  # use the system default browser\n\nwhile (<>) {\n    # match any line of the form \"URL = something-without-spaces\"\n    if (/^\\s*URL\\s*=\\s*(\\S+)\\s*$/) {\n        exec $browser, $1;         # successful exec never returns\n        die \"$0: could not launch $browser: $!\\n\";\n    }\n}\n\n\nA: In Unity we have .desktop files for defining items on the launcher, desktop, or other locations. To create these see the following question:\n\n\n*\n\n*How can I create launchers on my desktop?\nA link to an internet file may have an entry as simple as the following\n[Desktop Entry]\nEncoding=UTF-8\nName=Internet Link\nType=Link\nURL=<url>\nIcon=<icon to display>\n\nYou can create such a file with a text editor, or much easier by simply dragging and dropping a bookmark from your browser to the desktop.\nHowever keep in mind that such a simple .desktop file will not automatically open the given URL in a browser if the target is e.g a text document, or image. To overcome this see the following question:\n\n\n*\n\n*Desktop internet shortcut opens as text file\nIn case we do need to open .URL files more often (e.g. from a shared drive) we may also run a bash script similar to this to open them:\n#! /bin/bash\n\n# opens Windows URL file submitted as command line argument in browser\n\nsource $1\nxdg-open $URL\n\nThe command not found error from this script can be ignored or sent to /dev/null. If we must then we could associate this script to a Mime type for the extension URL to double click open an URL file.\n\nA: I'm on Lubuntu 18.04 and using a .desktop file with Type=Link and URL didn't work for me. It only shows an error message saying: HTTP Error: Bad Request.\nAs a workaround, I call my web browser directly with the URL:\n[Desktop Entry]\nEncoding=UTF-8\nName=My favorite website\nType=Application\nExec=firefox https://url.com\n\nThe problem seems to be with the file manager, in my case PCManFM 1.2.5. It throws a segfault in libfm.so.4.0, as can be seen via dmesg.\n", "Q: Windows 7 Computer won't boot after Ubuntu dualboot installation I have a Windows 7 32-bit laptop on which I installed Ubuntu alongside Win7. At first the problem was that it would boot directly into Windows without a boot menu as if Ubuntu didn't exist. I successfully used Boot Repair to get a boot menu and everything seemed fine. The next day I restarted the computer and now the computer won't boot at all. When the system is trying to boot I get the following:\nPXE-E61: Media test failure, check cable\nPXE-M0F: Exiting PXE ROM\nOperating system not found\n\nThe only way I can start the computer is by inserting the USB flash drive with Ubuntu bootable files on it which lets me use Ubuntu but not install it. This is the flash drive I originally used to try Ubuntu and then install it. Using the Boot Repair a second time didn't help. The system doesn't recognize my hard drive at all. I tried using the recovery function of my Windows 7 DVD which gave me a \"the partition table does not have a valid system partition\" error. Windows CD also doesn't recognize a hard drive or an operating system on my system.\nI have been browsing the forums but most other people with similar problems seem to have some sort of access to their hard drive but I haven't found a way yet. Can anyone help please?\n\nA: Your first Boot Repair output shows three disks:\n\n\n*\n\n*/dev/sda: A ~2GB disk (probably a USB flash drive)\n\n*/dev/sdb: A ~9MB (yes, MB) disk (I don't know what this is -- maybe a very old CF card or something)\n\n*/dev/sdc: A ~320GB disk (presumably your main hard disk)\n\n\nYour second Boot Repair output shows /dev/sda and /dev/sdb, but there's no sign of /dev/sdc. This leads me to think that you may have some failing hardware. If you're lucky, it could be that the hard disk has worked itself loose, and that pulling it out and re-seating it will fix the problem. If you're unlucky, it could be that the hard disk itself is failing and needs to be replaced. If you're very unlucky, it could be that a trace on the motherboard or the circuit that controls the hard disk on the motherboard is failing, in which case the computer has become more-or-less useless. The fact that Windows is sometimes reporting disk problems makes a hardware problem seem even more likely, since you'd need similar bugs in both OSes to explain this problem on the software level.\nIt's conceivable that an examination of the Linux kernel ring buffer (obtained by typing dmesg soon after booting) will provide some clues -- there might be a message about a failure to initialize /dev/sdc (possibly without that name, but the disk's manufacturer's name or \"ATA\" might appear in the message). Unfortunately, dmesg output is rather long and can be difficult for novices to interpret. You could redirect it to a file (dmesg > foo.txt) and post it to a pastebin site if you want to show it to us.\nYou could also try running a SMART utility on the disk, like smartctl, GSmartControl, or the Palimpsest Disk Utility's SMART tests (in increasing order of user-friendliness). This will be helpful only if the disk is accessible when you boot the computer, and it will return useful results only if the disk itself is failing in certain ways. A SMART test won't reveal problems with the motherboard.\nMoving the disk to another computer is another good diagnostic procedure -- if it works fine in another computer, then you know the problem is on the motherboard or is a result of a bad connection between the disk and the computer.\n", "Q: Command sudo halt don't run : speed dispatcher disabled edit /etc/default /speed dispatcher when I do sudo halt the computer shutdown but a black screen appear: where it was written lots of lines whose line Speed \ndispatcher  edit /etc/defaut/speed-dispatcher\n\n\nA: Updated as per comment above: Your computer is probably behaving as it should. There's a difference between \"halt\" and \"poweroff\" (and \"reboot\", of course). \nReboot means, as you probably know, \"shutdown the operating system, then restart it\".\nHalt means, \"shutdown the operating system, then leave the machine as it is, so the human operator can do as he pleases (reboot, power off or whatever he wants)\".\npoweroff means, \"shutdown the operation system, then power off the machine\".\nThere are commands for all three of those, called reboot, halt and poweroff. Additionally, you can use the shutdown command which offers options which way of shutdown you want, shutdown -h now, shutdown -r now etc. For more information, see man shutdown. Of course, there's a man page for reboot, halt and poweroff as well.\n\nMaybe the line you're seeing is about speech-dispatcher rather than speed-dispatcher? There are applications for Ubuntu that allow you to synthesize speech, for example to have the computer read texts for visually impaired users. speech-dispatcher is a package that supplies a common interface that such speech synthesizers can use. It looks like you installed that package (maybe as a dependency for some other package), but didn't configure it. If want to use speech-dispatcher, you'd probably want to configure it. If you don't, you can disable it to be started at boot time. This can for example be done with the graphic run level editor bum, as described here.\nThis should get rid of the \"speech-dispatcher\" line, but not necessarily of all lines. Ubuntu writes a lot of information to its terminal, about what it's doing, maybe what went wrong and such. When you start the graphical interface, it \"covers\" those messages. When you stop the graphical interface, the messages get visible again. So it's possible that the messages you're seeing are not from the boot process, not from the shutdown process. \nIn my estimation, your problem mostly is that when you command your computer to shutdown, it shuts down the graphical interface, but for some reason can't shut down the computer as a whole. Maybe your machine doesn't support it, or maybe something can't be terminated properly. Judging from this question, speech-dispatcher may be the cause, but this is mostly guesswork. If you disabled speech-dispatcher and your machine still doesn't shutdown properly, I'd look into the ACPI support of your machine. \n", "Q: Problem with vmlinuz.efi Ubuntu 12.04 LTS I am tying to install Ubuntu 12.04 along with windows on my PC. when i copy wubi in the folder where my iso file is and start it after some time it gave an error cann not install see log file.

If it's an older format (1.0 or 0.90), parted may misdetect one or two drives as being ext4, which you should ignore.\nIn any case, you have to format the RAID device itself (/dev/mdX), not the individual partitions. And instead of formatting directly as one big filesystem, you may opt to use LVM and then format the individual volumes you create on your RAID device.\n", "Q: How do I recover unsaved files in Gimp? I was working in Gimp on a cover for my new book but before I could finish it my computer crashed and I lost all of my info.

If the application crashes, there's no way to save the data before closing the error; so, you should save all of your data after every accepted step, unless you don't care if you lose your work.\nPlugin research revealed two promising links, which are both very similar.

Thirty minuets is a wide gap: I want to recommend 10 seconds, but perhaps the auto-save process is processor-intensive, and it might even interrupt your work-flow.  If it does not interrupt your work flow, you should get it down to less than 5 minutes because that's about how long an old laptop battery lasts if you forget to plug it in and don't get/have battery alerts  (like in Ubuntu Mate).\ndata-integrity\n\nA: Backups are kept in the /home/<user_name>/.gimp-2.8/tmp.\nOr you can to File menu to find the document history.

Just follow the steps:\nDownload Ubuntu\nYou can download Ubuntu from ubuntu\nDownload Unetbootin\nUnetbootin is the tool that I used to create a bootable USB drive with Ubuntu on it. To download Unetbootin visit unetbootin\nThen after downloading it run Unetbootin\nTo create a bootable USB drive you need to insert a blank USB drive into a USB port and then select the disk image option.\nClicking on the button with 3 dots brings up a file browser and you should be able to find the downloaded Ubuntu ISO.\nMake sure that the USB Drive is indeed in the drive letter specified and when you are happy that you aren't about to install somewhere you shouldn't click OK.\nIt takes a few minutes for Unetbootin to do it's stuff but ultimately you will end up with a bootable USB drive.\n\nTurn off fast boot\nTo turn off fast boot you need to get into the control panel and then the power options.\nTo open the control panel move your mouse to the top right corner and then click on the settings icon that appears.\nWhen the menu appears click on the control panel.\nFrom within the Control Panel click on the \"Power Options\" icon.\nFrom the \"Power Options\" screen look down the menu on the left side and select \"Choose what the power button does\".On the snappily titled \"Define power buttons and turn on password protection\" screen scroll down to the bottom.\nThere should be an option that says \"Turn on fast startup\". If this option doesn't appear click on the link at the top of the window that says \"Change settings that are currently unavailable\".\nIf the \"Turn on fast startup\" option is checked turn it off. I know that it says recommended but in this case it really isn't recommended.\nClick the \"Save Changes\" button to continue.\nTurn off secure boot\nTo turn off secure boot move your mouse to the top right corner and then click the settings option.\nNow comes the ninja bit. Hold down the shift key and select \"power\" and \"restart\" whilst keeping the shift key held down. (Take out the USB drive if it is still plugged in).When you reboot a screen similar to the one above will appear. The option you should choose is the UEFI Firmware Settings.\nAt this point you will be taken into the UEFI settings for your make of computer and I can't write instructions for each make and model therefore Google is your friend (and not at all evil). Type in your make and model and search for UEFI settings.\nWhen you are in the UEFI settings you are looking for the option that says something like \"Secure boot\" with the value set to \"Enabled\" and you want to set that option to \"disabled\".\n\nRun the Ubuntu Installer\nClicking on the \"Install Ubuntu 13.04\" (or 12.04 if you are going LTS) brings up the Ubuntu installer.\nThe first step lets you choose the language for the installer.\nIf you speak English I recommend choosing English (unless you feel you need an extra challenge) and indeed if you aren't a native English speaker then choose the language you feel most comfortable using.\nThe preparation screen shows you whether you are fully prepared for installing Ubuntu.\nAs you can see from the screen image I had plenties of disk space and I was fully plugged in to the power but I didn't have an internet connection.\nHaving the internet connection set up lets you download updates on the go. I prefer to do it afterwards.\nYou will also notice the \"install this third party software\" checkbox which will make Flash and MP3s work straight away after the install.\nIf you aren't already connected to the internet now is your chance to get connected.\nYou can choose any one of your broadband connections.\nI have 2 available to me and neither of them are any good.\nI prefer to install first and update later so  leave the internet disconnected.\nPartition the empty space\nThis bit is going to amend your hard drive partitions and if you didn't do a backup at the beginning this is the point of no return.\nI highly recommend making sure you have created the correct recovery media before continuing.  \nI could have made the install process one big step but the partitioning takes a bit of explaining so I put this in a separate section.\nThere are 2 options available to you from the partitioning screen.\nErase disk and install Ubuntu\nSomething else\nIf you just want to install Ubuntu and forget Windows ever existed (and if you have tried Windows 8 nobody is going to blame you for making this decision) you can simply press continue .\nThis guide is about installing alongside Windows 8 and therefore to do this choose \"Something Else\"\nThe disk layout on the Dell Inspiron 3521 is quite involved.\nWhat you should do is look for the large amount of unpartitioned space by scrolling down. (For the Dell it was /dev/sda7).\n\nWhen you find the unpartitioned space click on the plus symbol and create a logical partition. Mount the partition to / and set the size to 50 gigabytes. Set the partition type to EXT4.\nNow find the unpartitioned space again and click on the plus symbol and create another logical partition. Mount this one to /HOME and set the type to EXT4. The size should be virtually all the unpartitioned space minus about 16 gigabytes.\nThere is a lot said about how much swap space you need but as disk space isn't exactly expensive anymore I always just choosing 16 gigabytes which is way more than is actually required. (By quite some distance). You will therefore need to create a third partition in the unpartitioned space and choose SWAP as the type.\nWhen it comes to choosing where to install the bootloader don't change a thing. Leave it pointing to \"/dev/sda\". Whatever you do don't choose one of the other partitions like \"/dev/sda1\" or \"/dev/sda2\" etc. This is one of the most common mistakes people make.\nFor the 3 partitions that you just created make sure the format checkbox is checked.\nDo not continue unless you are really satisfied that you have done everything correctly and that you have a backup available in case of bad times.\nPress Install to continue.\nThe installation will now continue and you will see files copied across and the installation taking place.\nAt this point you will be able to choose keyboard layouts, timezone and you will be asked to add a new user.\nAt the end of the install process you will asked if you want to restart the system or continue using the live version.\nReboot into the live image\nAt this point it is worth rebooting the computer to see what has happened.\nWhen the computer has started to reboot remove the USB drive and let the bootup process begin as normal.\nIf you are lucky everything has worked perfectly well and you have a GRUB menu showing options for Windows and Ubuntu.\nThe reality is that you will be very lucky if that really has happened.\nOne of three things will have happened:\nUbuntu will have loaded\nWindows will have loaded\nNothing loads\nIf either Ubuntu or Windows loads then you just have a bootloader issue, if nothing loads it is likely that you didn't turn off secure boot and probably have messages on the screen saying so.\nUnless you have a perfectly running dual boot system plug your USB drive back in and reboot so that the live version of Ubuntu runs again.\nSOURCE : http://www.everydaylinuxuser.com/2013/09/install-ubuntu-linux-alongside-windows.html\n", "Q: Installing Ubuntu on a second non-empty drive My computer has a small SSD and a large regular HDD.

The disk might in principle have one massive partition (say, /dev/sdb1), which would be one problem; but if the partitioning tool is showing /dev/sdb as being unallocated (with no partitions), then that's an entirely different problem.\nIn the former case (one /dev/sdb1 partition), it could be that your disk is using dynamic (aka Logical Disk Manager, or LDM) partitions. In fact, this seems very likely, given that your screen shot identifies the disk as \"dynamic.\" Linux can't install to such a disk. Some third-party tools can convert from dynamic/LDM to basic non-destructively, though. IIRC, both Partition Wizard and EaseUS Partition Master can do this, but I've never used either tool, so I can't comment on how well they work. Such operations carry a small risk of serious data loss, so I recommend backing up important data before proceeding.\nIf the screen shot you showed is deceptive, you may have a damaged partition table, which can confuse libparted (upon which the Ubuntu installer's partitioning features rely), resulting in an apparently-empty disk. This page covers this issue in detail. Such problems can sometimes be fixed by my FixParts utility.\n", "Q: problem on java: not found Initializing InstallScape using JVM at /home/manoj/iscap/iscape/runtime/LNX86/bin/java.

You do have an EFI-mode version of GRUB installed on /dev/sdb5; however, your fdisk output indicates that your disk is partitioned using the MBR system, whereas EFI installations almost always use GPT, and /dev/sdb5 is marked in the MBR as a Linux partition, not as an EFI System Partition (ESP; the type of partition that holds EFI boot loaders). As 12.04.3 is fairly new, it could be that you've run into a new bug (or set of bugs) in its installer.\nI suggest you try the following:\n\n\n*\n\n*Using fdisk, change the type code on /dev/sdb5 (or /dev/sda5, if the disks change identities) from 0x83 to 0xEF.\n\n*Reboot. If it boots to Linux, declare victory and ignore the following steps.\n\n*Boot the System Rescue CD. (You could use an Ubuntu live CD/DVD, but that will require you to install gdisk, which was awkward from the Ubuntu live CDs/DVDs, the last time I checked.)\n\n*Launch gdisk on /dev/sdb. Type p to verify you've got the right disk, then type w to save the partition table. This should convert the disk from MBR to GPT form. See this page of the gdisk documentation for more on this procedure.\n\n*Reboot. If it boots to Linux, declare victory and ignore the following steps.\n\n*Re-run Boot Repair.\n\n*Reboot. If it boots to Linux, declare victory and ignore the following steps.\n\n*Download and prepare the CD-R or USB flash drive version of my rEFInd boot manager.\n\n*Boot using the rEFInd medium. You should see a rEFInd menu showing three Linux entries, each of which should boot Linux using a different kernel.\n\n*Try each of the kernels until one boots successfully. If none boot, post back with details.\n\n*If you can get Linux booted via the external rEFInd medium, install the rEFInd Debian package, remove the external medium, and reboot.\n\n*If you can boot with rEFInd installed on your hard disk, declare victory. If not, run the Boot Info Script, post the RESULTS.txt file that it creates to a pastebin site, and post back for more help (including the URL to your RESULTS.txt file).\n\n\nA: I had to do the first seven step but after that ubuntu works fine, probably I think that a previous installation of ubuntu not in uefi mode had set up the partition table to mbr and then when I've installed ubuntu in uefi mode it did not change the partition table.\n", "Q: Ubuntu downloads very slow.

Conceptually\n  similar to other file storage API's like S3, it is used to store\n  binary or large content - bug attachments, package builds, images and\n  so on.\n\nDecoupling file storage from the rest of Launchpad presumably makes it easier to scale out.

After installing windows I installed Ubuntu with creating a separated partition to boot. Then I have added this partition with EasyBCD software, as boot options of windows. Until here I didn't have any problems.\nBut choosing Ubuntu now causes an extra reboot. I don't want that, please tell me how to get ride of this problem or how to choose Ubuntu as my default boot.\nThanks in advance.  \n\nA: Did you try to change the default Boot entry?\nAlso, I don't think that using a EasyBCD would have been necessary. I'm not sure, but I think the extra reboot when you choose Ubuntu comes from that.\n\nA: You can't. Well let me rephrase that... Windows automatically hibernates by default when you shut down the computer (not Restart, just Shut Down). Even if you don't hibernate, it's hibernating the 'system session' for you.\nSo, because you installed with EasBCD, the Windows boot manager is in control, and it is aware that the drive is hibernated. So, it basically unhibernates itself which requires a restart.\nYou can try disabling Fast start, or you can select Restart instead of Shut down. I am not sure if this eliminates the restart, but it's worth a try. Or you can just learn to live with it. The good part is that it automatically allows you to mount the C: drive, whereas if Grub was your boot manager, you wouldn't be able to get read-write access to it while it's hibernated.\n", "Q: How to disable login password I am the only user on my PC and do not want to enter my password.

However, it seems that the Launchpad search only contains official packages. Is there a way to search Launchpad for unofficial packages and repositories?\n\nA: The second link you gave \"plasma-widget-stdin\" can be found by searching in the main launchpad site by searching by package name(I was able to find it that way). The 3rd link goes to the Ubuntu launchpad website, which only searches Ubuntu packages.  I'm not sure how you ended up on the \"official Ubuntu only site\" but if you end up there in the future, look in the bottom left of the screen, you will see the Launchpad name and logo, it will get you to the main Launchpad website and you can search for unofficial packages there.  To go there directly, the website is : \nlaunchpad.net \n(Which I belive answers your original question, but please read on)\n\nThe ppa that you linked to appears to be no longer maintained, so I would use any packages from it with extreme caution.  \nIf you do find a (active) ppa that contains it, you can download it by \n\n\n*\n\n*clicking the click just above the package list \"view package details\"\n\n*clicking on the package name\n\n*clicking on the .deb package that matches you architecture (i386 for 32bit or amd for 64bit)\n\n\nI would do this with extreme caution as well, often (but not always) the other packages that are added to the ppa are dependencies of that package that you want to add and using the new package with older dependencies can be unpredictable at best; \nIt may fail to install at all with the error that xx package is needed then you will have to go back to the ppa that you download the individual package from, download the package the was the dependency, try to install it, then go back again download the dependency for the dependency, then install the dependency for the dependency, then install the dependency, then install the package you wanted(this is known in the Linux world as \"dependency hell\" for obvious reasons, ppa are used to prevent this problem).    \n", "Q: Command not found when SSHing into Ubuntu 12.04 I have an issue when logging into my Ubuntu 12.04 machine via SSH.

See:\nUpdateMotd\nThe scripts are executed in order from 00 to 99 and write the output to the /etc/motd file.\nHence the file /etc/motd is still static and I don't think will be the cause of your problem.  Especially as the \"Last Login\" message is controlled by sshd and executed after motd.  You should examine your profile scripts.  Try your .profile, .bashrc or .bash_profile files in your home directory and look for the command that could be causing your problem.\nLess likely but possible is the file /etc/profile which could be being executed before your individual user profile is.  Check that too if your personal profile doesn't show anything.\n", "Q: Ubuntu Server Static IP Problem Hi I've been trying and trying to chang emy ubuntu servers IP to static so I can have people join my Minecraft server that I have set up, I've been working on it for 2 days straight with no luck, when I change my ip through\n sudo gedit /etc/network/interfaces\nI was told to change it to something similiar to this\niface eth0 inet static\naddress 192.168.1.100\nnetmask 255.255.255.0\ngateway 192.168.1.1\nbut it doesnt work for me i have tried in gateway putting my routers Ip address which i found in the routers menu information that doesnt seem to work\nwhat does is when i have the ip as 10.0.0.8 or something similiar thoe i still have problems\ncan anyone help I relaly want to get this set up and learn how to do this properly?\n\nA: You will need to set your DNS servers manually too.

I saw that some of the Lenovo laptops have \"vPro\" processors, which enable special management features:\nhttp://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/architecture-and-technology/vpro/vpro-technology-general.html\nMost of these features sound like software features, not CPU features, how exactly does this integrate? Is it compatible with Linux/Ubuntu management features? Is this the \"Trusted computing\" thing the free software folks were against some time ago?\n\nA: Intel vPro is a collection of computer hardware technologies that enable management features such as remote access to the PC, including monitoring, maintenance, and management independent of the state of the operating system or power state of the PC, and security features.Intel \nAnd since its not OS dependent, it should be compatible with Linux.  For more info see Intel Setup and Configuration Service 7.2: Designed for Linux\n\nA: Intel's vPro is basically a hardware capability of their CPUs and currently only marketed towards business customers. It's tied in with a lot of advanced management features. A CPU that is vPro capable still needs a TPM module (and probably more components see the Wikipedia article) to make up a vPro compliant computer platform which can be called a \"trusted system\". As a business customer, if you trust the manufacturer, the advertised features sound like a good thing to have.\nBecause additional hardware always increases the manufacturing costs and therefore adds to the product price, TPM modules cannot be found in computers meant to be sold at your electronics discounter these days. Consumer hardware may not even feature ports or sockets to upgrade to a TPM module, these may be found in enthusiast and business class hardware, but you may study the technical documentation or service and maintenance documents to be sure (at least Lenovo and HP still publish them along side the glossy marketing bullshit bingo documents). As of today, most computer systems that come with a TPM module need to have it activated, because it's initially deactivated. This may change with future iterations of Windows, where Microsoft is planning to require manufacturers that computers running Windows have to have an activated and armed TPM 2.0 module. It's currently not clear if this will happen in 2014, 2015 or later.\nOn a personal note: Back in 2006, I found it rather painful to see certain people being still strongly against TCPA, while the consortium was already renamed to TCG after numerous renamings. These people didn't know what they where against, but they where the first to buy \"HD ready\" TVs, HDMI cables and Bluray/HD-DVD players.\n", "Q: Improper unity display Today,after updating 12.04 LTS and Openoffice to 4.0.1, I noticed some missing programs in the menu, Software Center K3b.

I can plug the cable after login and configure the display, but then the mouse pointer on the laptop monitor flickers, and the external monitor only seems to refresh a small area for some time, so I get mouse trails and the likes.\nI was told these problems would be gone after installing the NVIDIA drivers, but the list in Additional Drivers is empty, and if I try to install the drivers through other means, it just stops detecting the monitor, even with xrandr.

From what research I've done, it seems these sorts of issues are invariably resolved by installing bumblebee (https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Bumblebee). I presume you have already tried this and had no success?\nFor what it's worth, this problem also surfaces on Mint and Fedora. What puzzles me, however, is that the slow refresh rate and lag vanishes when I'm watching a video, be it on youtube or VLC, only to reappear immediately once the video file is closed. Have you observed this too? If HD videos can run smoothly on the nouveau/intel drivers, why do less intensive applications lag?\nYou could give Compiz a shot and manually increase refresh rates, but I haven't had success with it: https://apps.ubuntu.com/cat/applications/compizconfig-settings-manager/\n", "Q: Share folder from ubuntu one files android Is it possible to directly share a folder from ubuntu one files for android? \nWhat about the app's developement?

With that built you can then blacklist it and load and unload with modprobe and rmmod at will.\nUnfortunately for me I think that my motherboard requires xhci_hcd even for usb 2.0 and cannot use just ehci_hcd, so not having the xhci_hcd module loaded means no usb at all (or I need to take further steps to get it working):\n$ lsusb\nunable to initialize libusb: -99\n\nBut it's useful to have a xhci module, I can at least recompile it with some hacks without having to recompile the whole kernel.\n", "Q: Mouse and Keyboard don't work from Shutdown, do work from Restart I have a Lenovo Twist.

Then I installed windows 8. Now I want to install Ubuntu 12.04 alongside with windows 8.\nI google and found this website where it describes how to install ubuntu alongside with windows 8. This is the link: http://www.everydaylinuxuser.com/2013/09/install-ubuntu-linux-alongside-windows.html\nI followed every steps on it. But then I stucked where I need to disable the secure boot. It seems since my laptop was not windows 8 preinstalled, when I went to the advanced options on windows 8 there is no \"UEFI firmware settings\". Thus I can't turn off the secure boot. I tried to look on bios and I couldn't find anything that related to turn off the secure boot.\nPlease tell me other way to disable the secureboot on windows 8?\n\nA: If the computer shipped with Windows 7, chances are it doesn't support Secure Boot, so you can skip any instructions that tell you to use it.\nBefore proceeding, though, you should determine whether Windows is booting in BIOS mode or in EFI mode. You can tell this by examining your partition table -- if it's MBR, Windows is booting in BIOS mode; and if it's GPT, Windows is booting in EFI mode. (See here for more information.) It's important to install Linux in the same mode as Windows is using. If you don't, you'll have to re-install your boot loader and/or jump through some extra hoops.\n\nA: UEFI and Secure boot can be confusing.  I wrote a summary after I read about it trying to install Ubuntu along side my Windows 8 here.\nThe big picture is that you most likely can't find UEFI and Secure Boot because your computer isn't using it.  If you install Ubuntu with UEFI selected in the BIOS, it will automatically install in EFI mode assuming that you have a 64-bit version.  Ubuntu also supports Secure Boot with Shim.  The only issue is Grub 2.0 doesn't currently boot Windows 8 in Secure Boot so that will need to be disabled to boot both OS's (The bug link is referenced in my previous post linked).  \nGoogling your laptop it appears it may support UEFI, but I find no evidence that it supports Secure Boot.  That would make sense since I'm pretty sure Windows 7 doesn't support Secure Boot. To know for sure go to C:\\Windows\\Panther\\ and open setupact and search for \"BootEnvironmentDetect\" and see if it is EFI or BIOS.  \nIf it is EFI make sure you are installing Ubuntu with the same type as Windows (most likely 64 bit) and it will auto install as EFI.  If you can't find Secure Boot, I wouldn't worry about it.  If it is on by accident, then everything will install and run normal until you try to launch Windows from Grub... then you'll know to look harder.\n", "Q: Help With Data Recovery I just want to ask whether I can recover data from a windows partition after installing ubuntu over it?

As you know, when defining a path in Windows, \"\\\" must be used instead of \"/\", and a \"C:\" at start.  \nSince every how-to about scp only contained linux-to-linux syntax, I used these to replace the Linux counterparts where needed. That is, I used the format \"C:\\FOLDER\\FOLDER\\FILE\" for the Windows part of the arguments.  \nHowever, as I have seen, the copying of the files has been constantly failing, with the message:  \n\"ssh: Could not resolve hostname C: No such file or directory\nlost connection\"  \nAny advice on what I have been doing wrong?\n\nA: It sounds like you're trying to scp from inside an existing PuTTY ssh session back to the Windows system - that's not going to work unless there is an SSH server running on Windows.\nPuTTY itself isn't an scp client, however the 'full' Windows installation comes with a command-line client called pscp. The syntax for that is pretty much exactly how you'd expect, i.e. a *nix style host:/path/to/file/ for the target file on the remote host, and a Windows-style path for the local system - for example\n\nC:\\Users\\steeldriver>\"C:\\Program Files (x86)\\PuTTY\\pscp.exe\" steeldriver@192.168.1.12:/home/steeldriver/tests.tar C:\\Users\\steeldriver\\Downloads\\linuxtests.tar\nsteeldriver@192.168.1.12's password:\nlinuxtests.tar            | 10 kB |  10.0 kB/s | ETA: 00:00:00 | 100%\nC:\\Users\\steeldriver>\n\nThe local path can be absolute i.e. C:\\path\\to\\newfile or relative e.g. ..\\newdir\\newfile\nHowever if you need to scp files regularly between *nix and Windows you may find it easier to use a dedicated client such as WinSCP\n", "Q: Using Dlink DWM 156 with Ubuntu 12.04.2 I have recently a new USB modem, named DLink DWM-156.

When I try to edit the ipsec tools I get the permission denied error.\n$ /etc/ipsec.conf\nbash: /etc/ipsec.conf:permission denied.\n\nHow can I solve this problem?\n\nA: If you have sudo privileges will need to use sudo vi /etc/ipsec.conf and enter your password.\nIf you aren't a vi fan, use any editor you want, such as a nano or gedit.\n\nA: The command /etc/ipsec.conf attempts to run /etc/ipsec.conf as a program or script. But it isn't an executable you wish to run--instead, it is a configuration file you wish to edit.\nHappily, it does not have execute permissions set on it, so this fails.\nTo edit a file, start with the program you wish to use to edit it, and then (after a space) supply the name of the file you want to edit. The general form of such a command is: editor file\nAs bntser says, this file is owned by root so you must edit it as root. (That is not the cause of the \"permission denied\" message, though, which is from trying to execute a file that does not have executable permissions.) To do so, use sudo, or gksudo.\nTo edit with a non-graphical editor, use sudo and provide the name of the editor. nano is easy to use. I recommend invoking it as nano -w for editing configuration files. This makes it so that when there's a line in the file that is wider (in number of characters) than your terminal, you scroll left and right to edit it. In other words, it disables \"soft\" word wrapping. Word wrapping can be confusing when editing configuration files, because unless you're quite familiar with the file's contents, you might not be sure where one line ends and the next begins.\nsudo nano -w /etc/ipsec.conf\n\nTo open the file with a graphical editor like gedit or leafpad, use gksudo:\ngksudo gedit /etc/ipsec.conf\n\nIf you don't have gksudo, you can install the gksu  package to get it, or you an use sudo -H or sudo -i:\nsudo -H gedit /etc/ipsec.conf\n\nHowever, you should avoid sudo gedit without -H or -i (and similar commands with gedit replaced by the name of another graphical program).\n", "Q: How to install the Java plugin for Firefox? I am trying to install Java and plugins for Firefox. I installed both the JDK and JRE.\nWhen I try with the sudo update-alternatives --config java command it shows only one choice available.\nPlugins are not usable in Firefox.\n\nA: Beginning in Firefox version 52, support for NPAPI plugins (java applets) in Firefox has ended, due to performance and security issues, the way that I manage to run java applets is to install the Extended Support Release (ESR) of firefox.\ndownload here:\nhttps://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/organizations/all/\nmore details here:\nhttps://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/npapi-plugins\n\nA: If you are using a version after 52 (not ESR), which disabled NPAPI, you are out of luck. If you are using one prior, which you absolutely wouldn't want to, you can install the OpenJDK JRE, which would allow you to execute Java binaries locally using the java binary. This however, isn't enough to execute Java web applets on your browser, which can be accomplished by installing the Icedtea plugin:\nsudo apt-get install icedtea-plugin\n\nThen go to about:addons, in the plugin section, check if the plugin is enabled. Mozilla disables insecure plugins by default, that means that Java is disable even after installation due security concerns. You need to activate it before using it.\n\nA: If you just downloaded and installed java jdk from oracle, then, let's say you have installed jdk-8u91-linux-x64.tar.gz on \n/my/java/directory/\nThen you'll have a directory like:\n/my/java/directory/jdk1.8.0_91/\nAll you have to do is go to your ubuntu firefox plugins directory and create a link:\n$: cd /usr/lib/firefox-addons/plugins/\n$: sudo ln -s /my/java/directory/jdk1.8.0_91/jre/lib/amd64/libnpjp2.so\n\n\nA: This is an old thread, but I stumbled upon it while googling a solution to my problem today. I figured someone else might be in the same situation.\nI need in-browser Java for legacy work-related websites, and the oracle java plugin does not cut it. After a long trial-and-error approach, I got IcedTea working consistently in an older version of firefox like this:\n\n\n*\n\n*Download a tar of Firefox, version 51 (newer version don't support the plugin)\n\n*Install the OpenJDK (7 or 8)\n\n*Install the icedtea--plugin and the icedtea-plugin\n\n*Now your openJDK installation will contain a IcedTeaPlugin.so file in the jre/lib folder\n\n*copy this to the mozilla/firefox plugin folders (I couldn't figure out which one to copy it too, so I just copied it to anything firefox/plugins or mozilla/plugins)\n\n*start your old firefox version\n\n*verify the plugin is active (check about:plugins)\n\n\nOne of my colleagues created a script to remove the old firefox, and untar it on every run. That way it never gets updated accidentally. Be sure not to do this with your main firefox application.\nI hope this helps you.\n\nA: Installing the IcedTea Java plugin:\nTo install the IcedTea Java plug-in, open a terminal and type:\nsudo apt-get install icedtea-7-plugin\n\nInstall the Firefox plug-in - Oracle\nIn a terminal:\nmkdir ~/.mozilla/plugins\n\nRemove the IcedTea plugin, if it has been installed.\nsudo apt-get remove icedtea6-plugin\n\nRemove a former version of the Java plugin (may or may not be present)\nrm ~/.mozilla/plugins/libnpjp2.so\n\nNow you can install the plugin, by creating a symbolic link (you tell Firefox where the plugin is located). For 32-bit Java, use\nln -s /usr/lib/jvm/jre1.7.0/lib/i386/libnpjp2.so ~/.mozilla/plugins/\n\nFor 64-bit Java use\nln -s /usr/lib/jvm/jre1.7.0/lib/amd64/libnpjp2.so ~/.mozilla/plugins/\n\nConfirm that the JRE has been successful by using the official Oracle website.\nSource: Java installation\n\nA: Its been a battle, especially since I went through this a couple of months ago with 14.04, forgot the solution, upgraded to 16.04.....\nIt is different I had Iced-tea and Oracle working under firefox in 14.04. I actually prefer Oracle (not generally but my use almost requires it) so I only have that now. I did not attempt any multiple installs or repositories. Symlinks as per most of the instructions out there are no good either. \nIn the end, in Firefox went to Edit--> Preference-->Applications    then scrolled down to the JNLP file extension and picked \"Use other...\" from the drop down menu. Then found javaws from the relevant directory.\nIt is only a workaround, and Im not sure if it will suit your needs.

I've tried using the msconfig command on run, and I checked the OSs I have, and it only says Windows 8? I've tried booting my USB again (which is what I used initially) and it also acts as if I never downloaded Ubuntu and gives me the option of installing or run without installing. What is going on? I even deleted my partitions (ultimately meaning I deleted ubuntu), made them again and re-downloaded Ubutntu, and the same thing happened. How do I get Ubuntu up and running, and how do I locate it?\n\nA: I think your problem may lie with UEFI.  Make sure if you are booting UEFI that you have the newest version of Ubuntu (12.04 was the first to support Secure Boot and UEFI), and that you are using a 64 bit version of Ubuntu (64-bit PC is AMD64 even if you run Intel).\nUbuntu will not install as EFI as a 32-bit version, so a 32-bit Ubuntu with a 64-bit Windows will not install as EFI.  This means that your BIOS will not boot or load the partitions, and only Windows will boot.\nSo here is what I recommend:  Disable UEFI and Secure Boot.  Boot your computer.  If Ubuntu is installed properly grub should load.  If it does, enable UEFI and reinstall Ubuntu with a 64 bit version.  If it does not load properly (still straight to Windows), then something is wrong with the way you installed Ubuntu.  The goal here is to rule out UEFI as your issue (which I'm pretty sure it is).\nHere is some good information on UEFI:\nhttps://help.ubuntu.com/community/UEFI\nI had to disable secure boot as Grub has a known bug for booting windows with Secure Boot right now.  \nEDIT:  I was confused with UEFI and Secure Boot when I first got into this, so I wrote a short summary on this page as I understand it.\n\nA: Because Windows 8 supports Secure boot and UEFI, the PC's preloaded with Windows 8 normally have both UEFI and Secure boot Enabled for security.  This will block every OS that doesn't support/conform to Secure Boot.\nTry updating your BIOS/EFI to the newest version. Maybe there is a \"fix\".\nBtw.: msconfig lists the OS's written in the Windows MBR. I doubt you will see Ubuntu in there. And I think a Windows can't read EXT partitions.\n", "Q: Flashcache on Xubuntu 13.04 First of all, I'm noob on using flashcache, and all that I'll post here is studying about it.\nI've an Asus K56CM, i5 with 500gb of HD and 24Gb of SSD for cache.

A few days ago I reported a strange issue with an old laptop after installing 12.04. I now know this is a problem with the kernel module presently supporting 12.04 (3.8), since with kernel 3.2 the laptop behaves regularly (booting Debian Wheezy).\nKnowing that 12.04 was initially released with kernel 3.2, I would like to try that first version on this laptop, but presently one can only download 12.04.3. So the question is to either obtain the first 12.04 release or revert 12.04.3 back to kernel 3.2. \nThanks. \n\nA: To install the Linux 3.2 kernel, install the linux-image-3.2.0-23-generic package. Then follow the steps here.\n\nA: There are possible two ways to get linux-kernel 3.2.x\n\n\n*\n\n*Since you can download only 12.04.3 from official site, one way is to download Ubuntu 12.04 searching the torrents. If you don't get, I'll create one for you, I've Ubuntu 12.04 and 12.04.2 images of x86 and x64 bits.\n\n*You can install Kernel 3.2.x from repository. Just search : Linux 3.2 in Synaptic you'll get a list of kernels from there you can install Kernel 3.2.x\nReply if you need further assistance..\n\nA: You can install the original 12.04. Search here, at the bottom of the page:\nUbuntu 12.04.2 LTS (Precise Pangolin)\nWith that, you can update and Ubuntu will keep the 3.2.x kernel.\n", "Q: Need help with mapping my keyboard I'm learning how to use Ubuntu right now, so far I'm enjoying it. There is this one thing I don't understand. I want to replace my Pg Up button with Alt+T. If I want to use T only I know I should use\nxmodmap -e \"keycode 87 = t\"\n\nbut I have no idea how to add the ALT button, any help.\n\nA: Discover how your system sees those keys, using the command xev and pressing the keys whose id you want to discover.After entering the xev just press page up and then press alt+t then you will get the following results. Then use the key code you got on pressing alt+t keys in the command at the end. that's all it will be done. I did this on my laptop and got the below results and so i gave it for reference only. You have to perform action to get your own result as these results vary with computer.\nPressing Up produces keycode 111, assigned to action Up:\nKeyPress event, serial 34, synthetic NO, window 0x3a00001,\nroot 0xa5, subw 0x0, time 13739005, (165,-16), root(170,32),\nstate 0x0, keycode 111 (keysym 0xff52, Up), same_screen YES,\nXLookupString gives 0 bytes: \nXmbLookupString gives 0 bytes: \nXFilterEvent returns: False\n\nPressing Pg Up key gives the following:\nKeyPress event, serial 32, synthetic NO, window 0x2400001,\nroot 0xc3, subw 0x0, time 13714833, (61,151), root:(63,236),\nstate 0x10, keycode 112 (keysym 0xff55, Prior), same_screen YES,\nXLookupString gives 0 bytes: \nXmbLookupString gives 0 bytes: \nXFilterEvent returns: False\n\nOnce you know the keycode of the keys you would like to use, and the name of the actions you want to perform, you can assign the desired actions to the chosen keys.\nThe following four commands will produce the desired change, valid only for the present X session:\nxmodmap -e \"keycode 112 = Up\"\n\nTo get these changes for every session, after issuing the commands above, create a file called .Xmodmap (or whatever), with the following command:\nxmodmap -pke > .Xmodmap\n\nThen, create a file called .xinitrc in your home directory, containing just the following line:\nxmodmap .Xmodmap\n\nEnjoy!\nRefer to the site for any doubts: http://wiki.linuxquestions.org/wiki/...txkbmap_Method\n\nA: You can't assign a combination of keys using xmodmap to a keycode. So, you can't replace replace Pg Up with Alt+T. If you do something like:\nxmodmap -e \"keycode 112 = Alt_L+t\"\n\nyou will get an error.\nYou can understand this and if you look at the output of the following command:\nxmodmap -pke\n\n\nBut with some tricks, if you really want to replace Pg Up with Alt+T, you can do it. You will need xdotool to do this. To install it run the following command in terminal:\nsudo apt-get install xdotool\n\nNow, just for test, if you run the following command in terminal:\nxdotool key Alt+t\n\nyou will see that this have the same behavior like when you press Alt+T. So, all you have to do now is to add Pg Up as a custum shortcut for this command. See here how you can create a custom keyboard shortcut: https://askubuntu.com/a/69161/147044.\n", "Q: Where are the systray icons for Dropbox in Ubuntu desktop 13.04 (minimal)?

Every time I close Sublime Text 2 and reopen it, my project folders are not shown, as are the open files I was using last time. Any ideas?\n\nA: Looks like a bug to me. I have been experiencing the same issue and we are not alone:\n\nThis is a bug with Windows ST3 Build 3033 (and probably all the other\n  OSes and builds as well).\nWhen I open a file - and then close the entire application (such as\n  with Alt+F4 or File>Exit) - the files that were opened before closing\n  the application do not get added to the \"Open Recent\" list.\nHowever - if I go to File-->Close - then if I close SublimeText and\n  open it again - then the files get added.\nIt seems the files are getting added to the Open Recent list during a\n  \"Close\" event which is not getting triggered during an application\n  exit. Also, FYI I have \"remember_open_files\": false, and \"hot_exit\":\n  false. So I expect that when I close the entire application - it\n  should add those files to the Recent list that were open when I exited\n  the app.\nSteps to reproduce:\n  \n  \n*\n  \n*Open a file in SublimeText.\n  \n*Go to File - Exit.\n  \n*Reopen SublimeText and check the menu File>Open Recent - file will not be there.\n  \n\nYou can find the corresponding bug report here.\n\nA: Try this command :\n sudo chown $USER -R ~/.config/sublime-text-2/\n\nsee if that works for u.\nUpdate:\nWhat happens is if/when you start sublime using sudo access, then sublime saves the temporary files for that session with sudo permissions. Now when you open sublime with a user without overwrite access to those files, sublime fails to save your session (Can't overwrite files written by root user).

Without the GRUB bootloader, the installed system will not boot\" while installation?\n\nA: UEFI is based on executing code in native mode. So no distributions have 32 bit versions for 64 bit systems.\nhttp://mjg59.dreamwidth.org/26734.html\nYou probably can install in BIOS mode if you want.\n\nA: Oldfred is correct; however, it's also possible to use a 64-bit version of some EFI boot loaders (GRUB 2 and/or ELILO, but I'm not sure if both of them work) to boot a 32-bit kernel. This requires manual configuration, though, so you'll need to understand your EFI boot loader pretty well to attempt it. See my Web page on EFI boot loaders for some background -- but I don't cover the 32-bit kernel on a 64-bit EFI case.\nSpeaking more broadly, it's seldom necessary or even desirable to install a 32-bit version of Linux on 64-bit hardware. The 64-bit software has long been quite stable. There are performance plusses and minuses for both bit depths, but the biggest minus for 64-bit software applies only if you've got very little RAM by today's standards. If you really need the 32-bit distribution for some reason, installing a 32-bit distribution in VirtualBox may be a better solution than attempting a dual-boot setup.\n\nA: I have overcome from this issue by customizing 32 bit ISO file using Ubuntu-builder.In that i have installed grub-efi \"apt-get install grub-efi\" hence Installation goes will without any error.\nThis is the solution for this issue.\n\nA: This must be another solution if the other previous ones could solve well. Normally new models use UEFI to boot. That's the problem. Use legacy boot or old boot method instead of UEFI.\nYou can disable UEFI in BIOS or you can press \"F9\" or some F keys to prompt for the boot options, in which case, choose normal usb boot instead of UEFI.\n", "Q: The system is running in low graphics mode?

(\"I suppose that on this Eee PC 4G there's no Nvidia card.\") \nBy any chance, were you trying to install graphics drivers using Wine?\nI found this information about your Asus.\n\"the Eee PC is a compact and low power sub-notebook. It is based on the Intel 915GM chipset and is powered by a 900MHz Intel Celeron processor.\"\nYour notebook uses Intel Graphics so I suspect you have somehow replaced the correct drivers with a corrupted install of Nvidia drivers.\nSince you haven't been able to use your netbook for over a week, I would ask if you have anything on it you want?\nI\nf you do not I think you would be better off just doing a fresh install of Ubuntu.\nAlso you need to always find out exactly what hardware you have before trying to install drivers or else you may well be back to the blinking cursor.\n\nA: If you want to install Windows XP or even Windows 7 on your Asus you can do that using a flash drive.\nYou need to download a program called Win2Flash.  It is very easy to use and it burns XP or windows 7 to your flash drive so you can boot to it and install in to your notebook.\n", "Q: How to execute command with keys? Like a lot of other users, I have problem with the brightness settings on my laptop. But there is xbacklight which works like a charm.\nHow do I bind xbacklight -dec 10 to Fn+Up?\nI have tried to use custom shortcut with no success.\n\nA: According with this post, in general there is no way to know that Fn was pressed and the keycode of key-combinations including Fn depends on the individual keyboard design. In fact, when you press only the the Fn key, this doesn't send any data to the computer.\nSo unfortunately, you can't bind this combination: Fn+Up. More about: Fn key.\nWhat you can do is to use another key combination to add a custom keyboard shortcut.\n\nA: You can use a software called \"Autokey\": it will start after the login if you want and supports scripting & key combinations.You can install it from the Ubuntu repository (apt-get install autokey).\n", "Q: Emacs GTK keybindings theme in 13.04 I'm trying to enable Emacs GTK keybindings in a fresh install of Ubuntu 13.04, but it doesn't seem to take effect.\nWhat I have already tried:\n\n\n*\n\n*enabling it in gnome-tweak-tool\n\n*executing gconftool-2 --set /desktop/gnome/interface/gtk_key_theme Emacs --type string\n\n*executing gsettings set org.gnome.desktop.interface gtk-key-theme \"Emacs\"\n\n*adding gtk-key-theme-name = \"Emacs\" to my ~/.gtkrc-2.0\nNone of those seemed to work.

It was always from a smaller SSD (120 GB) to a at least same sized or bigger SSD. I could always copy the whole drive (sda to sdb).\nNow I would like to copy Windows from a HDD to a SSD. My SSD is only 120GB while the HDD is 500GB. Obviously I can't copy the whole HDD drive as it is too big. Therefore I have reduced the size of the Windows System Partition to 70GB.\nThe problem is that I still can't copy the whole drive itself, as it has a 105MB System reserved partition, 70GB Windows System partition and about 420GB on a free partition.\nI would now need to copy sda1 (System Reserved) and sda2 (Windows partition) at the same time (and disregard the rest) to sdb (unpartitioned SSD).\nWhen I copy a whole SSD drive to another SSD Windows is starting perfectly, but how can I copy the proper image (MBR, System Reserved and Windows partition) from a much bigger HDD to a smaller SSD?\n\nA: See where the partition ends with sudo parted /dev/sda unit s print.  Add one to the end sector, and tell dd to copy that many sectors: sudo dd if=/dev/sda of=/dev/sdb count=xxxx where if is the input device and of is the output device.\n\nA: Since you have already resized the partition you should at first copy the partition table and if there exists MBR bootloader data by copying the first megabyte of the disc (if your partition layout is aligned). Then reconnect the disc so that Linux finds the new partition table. Now you can copy the individual partitions.\nSince you are a german speaking user you will find the Ubuntu Users article on dd very helpful.\nHowever, you never ever write with dd on SSDs. dd is already a mechanical a torture for HDDs, but on SSDs it's against all their wear out prevention mechanisms. You are writing to every data cell (no matter if free it's empty or not), while as a rule of thumb to maintain write performance, it's recommended to keep half of the drive space empty. You should install a fresh copy of Windows to the new disc. Rumor has it that the Windows installer detects SSDs and treats them differently than HDDs.\nI recommend using Windows deployment tools like imagex in conjunction with bcdboot or bootrec.\n", "Q: How to insert characters after every line in a file?

I was setting up a cloud server and saw that I accidentally added a folder named ^[[4~ (with escape code). I want to see what is inside and if that was just a mistake then remove that directory. However I cannot cd nor ls the contents. I tried finding out the escape code so that I could enter a command like cd \\x1b[30m; and hope that it would get me in the directory.\nWhat if I was to cd or remove by searching for the first directory listed with ls. Would that be possible? Because when I do a ls |grep 4 two results come up and one of them is the one I'm trying to access.\nEither finding out the folder name in escape string or changing the directory to the first directory ls finds might be a solution here. How can I approach this problem?\n\nA: A funny way to deal with that, using Bash: cd into the directory (that's easy).\nThen we'll check that a control character is in the file's name: if you issue\nprintf 'strange: %s\\n' *[[:cntrl:]]*\n\nyou should see your file there. If not, try to use another character class or modify the glob so that it matches your file name. (But very likely, you'll only have the bizarre one.) Then, three possiblities:\n\n\n*\n\n*The previous command only issued your bizarre file. Then, easy, just rename it:\nmv -nv *[[:cntrl:]]* a_less_bizarre_name\n\ndone!\n\n*The previous command issued several filenames with bizarre names. Then, rename them all as:\ni=0\nfor biz in *[[:cntrl:]]*; do\n    mv -nv \"$biz\" a_less_bizarre_name$((++i))\ndone\n\ndone!\n\n*The previous command output several names, but you only want to change one. In this case, we'll put them all in an array, print them all out with a number in front, and then we'll select only the one we want:\nbizarre=( *[[:cntrl:]]* )\nfor index in \"${!bizarre[@]}\"; do\n    printf \"%s --> %s\\n\" \"$index\" \"${bizarre[index]}\"\ndone\n# Then, look at the index of the one you want to rename\n# If its index is 42, issue:\nmv -nv \"${bizarre[42]}\" a_less_bizarre_name\n\ndone!\nNote. If you use these commands, make sure you use them with the proper quotings (i.e., the quotings I gave). Do not alter the quotings!\nRemark. You will very likely want first to issue the mv I gave with an echo in front, just to see what it'll do, e.g.,\necho mv -nv *[[:cntrl:]]* a_less_bizarre_name\n\nand remove the echo when you're happy with it! Anyways, I'm using the -n switch so as to not overwrite an otherwise existing file. All these commands are rather safe if you use them as I typed them.\nGood luck!\n\nA: *\n\n*Find out what the directory is named as escaped:\n$ ls -b\n# \\033[4~\n\n\n*Remove by:\nrmdir -v `echo -e \"\\033[4~\"`\n\n\nA: I don't know if it works for special chars too, but it's worth giving it a try.

Can I still use those external hard drives on Ubuntu without doing anything, or do I have to do anything with the filesystem?  \n\n*I have some software that I haven't found for Ubuntu. If I use Wine on Ubuntu, will any Windows program then run smoothly?  \n\n*If I decide to dual boot my computer with Windows XP and Ubuntu, can I access my external hard drives with both systems? \n\n\nA: *\n\n*Yes all external hard drives can be used as normal. Just click on them in Ubuntu to mount them. Ubuntu can read/write to NTFS and you can just use your files as normal. \n\n*You need to check the WineDB for what programs are supported. Also checks versions and what functions aren't supported, everything doesn't work with wine. \n\n*Yes the dual boot system does not affect anything outside of Ubuntu. Everything can still be used. I would try Ubuntu (or what flavour you want) on a Live-USB/CD to see that you like it before you install. Since your computer is now running XP (which is quite old) you might have to look at lighter versions of Ubuntu like, Xubuntu or Lubuntu. It depends on how much RAM you have since Ubuntu(12.04/13.04) is using more RAM than Windows XP.\n\n\nI've listed some usefull questions on this topic below.\n\n\n*\n\n*How do I install Ubuntu?\n\n*How can I dual boot Windows and Ubuntu?\n\n*How do I find out which version and derivative of Ubuntu is right for my hardware in terms of minimal system requirements?\n\nA: \nI am a Windows user planning to convert to Ubuntu.\n\nNo problem. However, I recommend to use Kubuntu instead of \"standard\" Ubuntu, because it has \"more traditional\" interface similar to Windows. Or for slower machines, use Lubuntu.\n\nI have several external harddrives with documents (doc, xls etc),\n  pictures, music and movies. Can I still use those external harddrives\n  on Ubuntu without doing anything, or do I have to do anything with the\n  file system?\n\nYes, I am using plenty of removable flash disks, HDDs etc. on Windows and linux computers and never did anything special to make them work on both systems.\n\nI have some software I so far don't find for Ubuntu. If I use Wine on\n  Ubuntu, will any windowsprogram then run smooth?\n\nNo, there is not 100% guarantee that all SW will work using Wine. Check Wine Application Database to make sure about particular apps.\n\nIf I decide to dual boot my computer with XP and Ubuntu, can I access\n  my external harddrives with both system\n\nNo problem here :-) The only problem could be if you were using some disk encryption which is using Windows only program.\n\nA: If you want Ubuntu as primary OS and don't want dual boot or having to run Wine apps in Ubuntu, i recommend installing Oracle Virtual Box (free) in Ubuntu, then install your Windows OS in Virtual Box. that way you can run the entire Windows OS inside of Ubuntu without it having to have any root privileges like Wine needs. However, if it is an older slower machine, Virtual Box wont do it, I tried it on a vintage 2003 Dell pc, single core CPU, 2 GB RAM, the CPU couldn't handle it, it couldn't handle anything later than Ubuntu 11.04 anyway. But if you have at least a dual core (preferably quad core - 4 physical cores) CPU and 2 GB RAM or more, then you should be fine.

The solution above configures Ubuntu on the LAN but without a Gateway as it is not necessary as well as on PPPOE for internet access (using your ISP's gateway).\n\nA: Can't you connect your TP-Link router to the DSL modem and initialise the PPPOE connection from there? or even better, a lot of DSL modems provided by ISPs can actually switch their mode of operation and become independet routers doing the PPPOE connection for you. Look up your modem on internet forums, see if it comes with an IP address to some web interface where you can make settings.\nUsing your embedded hardware for initialising the PPPOE connection has some advantages:\n\n\n*\n\n*All your devices can connect to the internet, including Laptops of your guests, etc.\n\n*You have only one gateway and routing gets a lot less complicated\n\n*services from your PC are no longer exposed to the internet\n\n*you can upgrade, change, etc. your PC without having to bother about PPPOE credentials\n\n\nWell and of cource you retain the connection to your LAN.\n", "Q: Can notify-send be used to send pop-up notifications to a Windows X server over ssh? I'd like my backup script to issue a notification once it's done. I run Ubuntu as a headless server and login into it using PuTTY on Windows. I've already installed x11-apps and verified xclock and xcalc to run successfully on the Windows X server (Xming).\nIf this is not possible, which notification system can I use instead?\n\nA: If your server is 'truly' headless - as it will be when you installed a server edition of Ubuntu - then it will not have the X libraries installed and therefore will not be able to act as an X client, so there is no way for it to control the X server on Windows. (Note that not even xterm will be installed.)\nIf your PuTTY session is still open, then the server could use wall to make a notification appear on all terminals.\nOtherwise, the customary (and resilient) way to notify the administrator is to send e-mail. If you use cron to trigger the backup job, you don't even need to do anything for that. I'm a bit out of touch with Windows, but I guess you can make Windows notify you when a specific email comes in.\n\nA: I've managed to do this with growl for windows. Here's something that should get you started real quick:\n\n\n*\n\n*Install growl for windows\n\n*On the 'security' tab of the growl configuration, disable the 'require password for LAN apps'(YMMV, I manage security using windows firewall) and enable 'Allow network notifications'\n\n\nThe above will enable a notification server on windows(add growl for windows to the startup applications so you always have it running)\nThere are many ways to send notifications from your ubuntu server, heres a simple way with python:\n- Install python/virtualenv\n- Install gntp package: $ pip install gntp\nNow open a text editor and paste the following:\n#!/usr/bin/env python\nimport gntp.notifier\n\n\ndef send(description, applicationName='Sample Application', noteType=\"Message\",\n    title=\"Msg\", applicationIcon=None, hostname='127.0.0.1',\n    password=None, port=23053, sticky=False, priority=None,\n    callback=None, notificationIcon=None, identifier=None):\n\n    growl = gntp.notifier.GrowlNotifier(\n        applicationName=applicationName,\n        notifications=[noteType],\n        defaultNotifications=[noteType],\n        applicationIcon=applicationIcon,\n        hostname=hostname,\n        password=password,\n        port=port,\n        )\n\n    result = growl.register()\n\n    return growl.notify(\n        noteType=noteType,\n        title=title,\n        description=description,\n        icon=notificationIcon,\n        sticky=sticky,\n        priority=priority,\n        callback=callback,\n        identifier=identifier,\n        )\n\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    send('Testing sample application')\n\nThis assumes that your ssh client is forwarding port 23053 to your windows machine.\n\nA: Maybe notify-send is not going to work from an ubuntu desktopless server.

I am very unhappy with that for several reasons.\nSince Ubuntu ships with a good, stable and lightweight PDF-viewer, evince, I'd rather have all PDFs handled by that native viewer instead of the Firefox one.\nI suspect it's because of either the mine-type, some extension, a disposition-header or some combination thereof, but some PDFs open already just fine in Evince. Others still open in the PDF.js. \nHow can I direct all PDFs to the native, evince, viewer?\n\nA: If you'd rather not use the built-in PDF Viewer, you can use another PDF viewer like Evince or another default viewer on Ubuntu.\nTo switch from the built-in PDF viewer to another PDF viewer:\n\n\n*\n\n*At the top of the Firefox window, click on the Edit menu and select Preferences\n\n*Select the Applications panel.\n\n*Find Portable Document Format (PDF) in the list and click on it to select it.\n\n*Click on the drop-down arrow in the Action column for the above entry and select the PDF viewer you wish to use.\n\n*Click Close to close the Preferences window\n\n\n\n(Source https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/disable-built-pdf-viewer-and-use-another-viewer)\n\nA: The problem seems to be a setting in ~/.local/share/applications/mimeapps.list\nIt's this entry thats needs to be modified:\napplication/octet-stream=gedit.desktop (it may look different on your machine)\n\nAs soon as I changed this to:\napplication/octet-stream=evince.desktop;gedit.desktop\n\nfirefox would suggest to open a .pdf file with evince instead of gedit\n", "Q: Changing shell colors: \"dircolors -b command not found\" (Preface: I'm brand new to Linux.)\nProblem\nI'm trying to change to colors of the file system in the bash shell.

When I turn on the machine, the display appears blank until the login screen appears. No OS selection menu (which I had), no Ubuntu boot splash screen (which was also appearing), nothing. I feel like the display is disabled until Ubuntu boots up, because I don't even get the manufacturer boot screen. For instance, when I press the delete key to enter the BIOS setup, the Ubuntu login screen never appears, but neither does anything else. Same as if I press the down arrow and enter at the time I assume the OS selection menu is onscreen. Except it's not on screen, because the screen isn't even on - it remains off (not just blank, I can tell it's off). What do I do?\nThe weirdest part is that everything was working fine, manufacturer logo, boot selection, and Ubuntu splash all appearing, for a few days, until today. In the beginning I did have some issues getting things to work since my system is UEFI, but it was working, but now it has seemingly randomly stopped. One thing worth noting is that at one point after this malfunction I tried mounting the Windows partition, and I got this error:\nThe NTFS partition is in an unsafe state. Please resume and shutdown\nWindows fully (no hibernation or fast restarting), or mount the volume\nread-only with the 'ro' mount option.\n\nIt's certainly plausible that Windows could be hibernated, but I have no idea how to un-hibernate it because of the above issue.\nMy system is an Asus Q400A. Intel Core i7 3632QM, 8GB memory, HDD replaced with a 128GB Crucial M4 SSD.\n\nA: OK, I seem to have solved the problem, though I'm still unsure exactly what was happening. It seems when I told Ubuntu to shut down, it wasn't shutting down completely. I noticed the power light would be flashing like it does when on standby, so I tried something different. I shut Ubuntu down from the terminal with sudo shutdown -h now, then unplugged the laptop and removed the battery. This removed all possibility of the computer being on in any way. When I plugged back in and started up, voila: manufacturer splash logo, GRUB, and I could choose Windows.\nThe laptop being on standby (mostly) explains why I couldn't access anything else, since it would resume straight to Ubuntu rather than doing a full startup sequence. However, it certainly doesn't make sense that Ubuntu would not shut down when I told it to the regular way, nor that I could avoid the Ubuntu login screen appearing by pressing keys similar to GRUB selections and BIOS menu triggers. Furthermore, I got the full Ubuntu login screen when I would try to start up, not the lock screen which I would expect if it were truly on standby. Furthermore, when I managed to get Windows started, it did not appear to have been in hibernation.\nDoes any of this make sense? No. Did I manage to get things working despite that? Yes.

But either I am missing something or just oversee. I have researched this for 2 days- I am very sorry to ask a question you have answered a million times.\n\nA: The DVD will need to be formatted (to make it bootable and write the Live system) but the hard drive you want to install Ubuntu on will not be formatted until you ask it to. You wont need to format the whole drive, anything more you want to know?\n\nA: Not sure if this will be helpful, but, I burned an ISO copy from download but didn't use it for about a week.\nI was worried it may reformat drive but I've installed Ubuntu 12.04 on a VISTA laptop and a XP desktop as dual boot without losing any information on Windows installs.\nYou must have an OS installed at present?\nset up for dual boot. \nOne thing though, on laptop, I have to select Ubuntu.\nOn desktop I have to select XP if I want it even though it was originally set as master boot?\nNo idea why but I kinda like it\n\nA: If you install Ubuntu via the DVD, it will automatically detect if you already have an operating system.\n(Here I assume that you already have Windows; however, you may have any or all of Windows, Mac or Linux, or none of them. Where I say \"Windows\" below, replace that with whatever you already have.)\nIf you already have Windows, the installation will give you the choice to use the whole hard drive or to dual boot.\n\n\n*\n\n*If you choose to use the whole drive, the installation will format your entire drive and you will lose everything that was already there — Windows, data, whatever. Everything.\n\n*However, if you choose to keep Windows (\"dual boot\"), the installation will keep your Windows and your data intact. It will reserve and format roughly half of your hard drive for Ubuntu, and install Ubuntu there. Thereafter, each time you boot, you will be asked which system you want to boot (Windows or Ubuntu) — they don't boot at the same time.\n\n(Windows and Ubuntu can be made to boot at the same time, using either Virtual Box or Xen, or their equivalents, but that is another, complicated, story.)\n\nAlso note that Ubuntu can access and modify your Windows data, but not vice-versa.\n\nOne more thing. Most modern Windows systems come with two drives: C: and D:. In fact, these are usually two partitions sharing a single drive. If your D: drive is unused and completely empty, you can delete that partition (i.e. the D: drive) before installing Ubuntu; the installation will use that freed space. You can do this from Computer Management in Windows, but please take care to delete the correct partition (otherwise you will lose data and possibly Windows).\n\n*You have a third choice, where you can manually allocate parts of the drive. As you are new to Ubuntu and installation, I suggest that you avoid use this option, unless you clearly understand drives, partitions, and how Windows (mis)names them.\n\n\nBe aware that an installation of any operating system (Windows, Mac, Linux) carries a small risk of data loss. Therefore, please back up all your data before you install Ubuntu.\nFinally, the installation of Ubuntu can be undone, although you will need to ask specifically how.\n", "Q: Move a partition out from under scp: why does it carry on? I was downloading, using scp, a large file from \"remote\" to \"myserver\"; it is taking a few hours. It is/was downloading to \"~/stuff/\". Let's call it \"x.tgz\".\nThen, forgetting about that, a little while later, I noticed disk space was getting low on the /home/ partition. I noticed \"~/stuff/\" was quite big, so decided to move it from my /home/ partition to my emptier /backup/ partition: cd;mv stuff/ /backup/\nGreat, reasonable amounts of disk space in all partitions again.\nThen I remembered the long-running scp process, slapped my forehead, and went to look at it, expecting an error message.  But it is still happily downloading. Eh?\nSo, is it still being saved to /home/ partition, or the /backup/ partition? I think I can answer that, as it appears disk space is still going down on /home/ but not /backup/\nBut, what will happen when it finally completes? Will I have a partial /backup/x.tgz and a full ~/stuff/x.tgz? Or the first half in /backup/x.tgz and the second half in ~/stuff/x.tgz ?\nMore importantly: have I messed it up, and I should kill scp, and start again?\n\nA: It looks like some/most/all of \"x.tgz\" was loaded into ram for the scp'ing. I would suggest though killing the process and running it again. Though it would be interesting to see if it really worked, you could wait it out or even run a parallel scp and when the original one is done run a md5sum x.tgz on both the remote and the host. If the hex outputs match up then they are the same.\n", "Q: Ubuntu installation is slow, why? I am currently installing Ubuntu 12.04.3. Everything was going fine until I came across this...\n\nInstalling System\n\nIt is sssooooooo close to being finished! Like 1/6 of the way there! I just wanted to know if this is normal or if something is wrong. I'm installing it through a flash drive if that helps \nAlso,what will happen if I press the skip button that pops up when I click Installing System?\n\nA: do try not to install - updating while installing.  Just do installing without connecting to Internet.  \nI too had this, and when I tried installing for my friend at his home (without internet) it was just as fast as other installations.  \ntry it and let us know how it goes\n\nA: Ubuntu installation is slow could be caused by a slow mirror, the bandwidth from your ISP is low or there are bad sectors on the computer's hard drive.\n\nA: I had a problem like this-do you know how much ram your system has? If it has under 512MBs, than ubuntu installation will be very slow, and will be sluggish when running it.\nEdit: disconnecting the internet may help, Ubuntu may install updates while installing which will take a long time as was stated below. Good luck mate!\n\nA: I found that after a few freezes, very slow install, a couple of resets, that the auto side-by-side didn't work well, but after a great deal of pain in the manual partition section working out how it works, how to create partition, and as much pain working out what partitions are required, it installed snappy!.\nAndrew Robertson\n\nA: I cleaned the fan because I guess my computer was overheated and then the speed is normal. Have a try. I don't think the problem is on the memory size or processor, because Ubuntu installer first test pre-requirements before install it.\n", "Q: Get list of installed packages - from damaged partition I'm running 13.04 on VMWare Fusion 6 on top of OS X, which has some serious stability problems, necessitating hard reboots (power cycling) at least once/day if not more. \nSince VMWare is lame and doesn't always write disk data to disk, it is very easy for virtual machines to get damaged when someone restarts the machine without shutting down the VM. \nAt any rate, I've got a virtual disk from my old VM which can be mounted in a new install, but I don't know how to get a list of installed packages, since dpkg is looking at its new database and doesn't care about the old one. \nThere are a lot of issues with the old partition, files corrupted and such, so I can't just dd it to a new location. I figure the easiest way forward is to compile a list of packages I added post-install, then feed it to dpkg and apt-get as in this answer. My only problem is generating that list of packages. Can anyone help?\n\nA: If you can mount the virtual disk enough to see the /var/lib/dpkg/ directory, you can tell dpkg to look there with the \"--admindir\" option.\ndpkg --admindir=/mountpoint/var/lib/dpkg --list\n\nThe only file that is really needed is /var/lib/dpkg/status (or one of its backups). So you could copy that single file to an empty directory and point dpkg at that directory.\n", "Q: Problem Dual Booting Ubuntu with Windows 8 So I got a new laptop an Asus Q501L and I went to install Ubuntu 13.04 alongside Windows 8. I had problems booting to the LiveUSB but managed to work around the bios I ran the Boot Repair using the try Ubuntu and installed Ubuntu with the run alongside Windows 8 option. Well now when I boot it skips Grub and goes straight to Windows 8 and now when I try to log into the Live USB it stops loading saying it can not mount so I can't re-run Boot Repair. Any help would be nice because I need Ubuntu in order to do some of my assignments.\n\nA: Perhaps windows remains the default startup option in the UEFI/BIOS (They look the same but i expect you have UEFI if your computer is so new). Ive noticed on my computer that Ubuntu doesnt change the default boot option. Therefore, it will never go to the Ubuntu bootloader (grub2).\nI suggest starting up in the UEFI by holding f2 upon startup, then selecting Ubuntu as the default startup option.\nIf you dont have Ubuntu as an option in that screen, or you do and it doesnt work, then there is an issue with the installation. I suggest re-creating the live USB in WIndows then trying boot repair. You may need to disable 'UEFI secure boot' to boot from the liveUSB - I had to, because the LiveUSB was unsigned.\nIf the Ubuntu default boot gives you an error about the signature instead of starting up - it means Ubuntu grub2 is working and UEFI is blocking the boot (because UEFI secure boot is enabled). You could just leave secure boot disabled but this exposes every OS on your computer to the related risk.\nAn unsigned Ubuntu installation can be fixed by running boot repair to install the signature key, so that you can boot Ubuntu with 'UEFI secure boot' enabled. In boot repair advanced options look for the option that mentions secure boot or signature. (Dont select or say yes to any option to create backup of EUFI/boot files, it will disable the windows bootloader)\n\nA: did you selected the secure boot option in your bios that you can select if you have windows 8?\ntry to turn it off and see if you can reach the grub boot loader, on asus motherboards it is very easy to do!\nif not try to delete ubuntu, and deselect the secure boot option and install ubuntu then.\n", "Q: SSD cache for Lenovo Y500 I have a Lenovo Y500 with a dual GTX650M, 16Gb SSD and 1Tb HDD.\nI just install a clean Ubuntu 13.04 then upgrade to 13.10.

So is there anything I can do to have an alternative to Intel Smart Response technology that is available in Windows 8?\nLastly, would it be better if I just install /root on the SSD with /home on HDD? Will there be any performance improvement using this set-up instead of SSD Cache?\nThank you in advance for your help. Since I'm very new to Ubuntu, some links to existing tutorials or informations will be so much appreciated. \n\nA: I have similar hardware configuration in my Asus k56cm, and same questions.\nI tried to use flashcache, but I'm having problems. You can see in my historical questions.\nFlashcache on Xubuntu 13.04\nThe better solution I found is using flashcache, instead the others, because kernel recompilation is not necessary, but having only 24gb in the ssd, I think that caching /root is too large. I think the better thing is cache /home\n", "Q: My Fn keys just stop working! Well I have ubuntu 12.04LTS on my laptop. Everything worked fine till last night.

My volume keys (\nmute-lower-higher volume) won't working anymore!!!\nWhat's the problem?\nI did not change or update anything. The last time I used my system I was playing a game via Wine. \nWhat should I do?\n\nA: It could be that the game you were playing inside of wine changed the resolution of the desktop which has strangely stayed the same on reboot, reset the screen resolution in settings...  As for the fn keys, that's a strange one as you should still be using the same keyboard language as before but to be sure go into Kayboard Layout and check it's set for your laptop...\n", "Q: How do I actually disable F11-fullscreen on Lubuntu 13.04? I have already deleted the entry for F11-fullscreen from ~/.config/openbox/lubuntu-rc.xml\neven after a reboot, the F11 fullscreen functionality remains, and I can't use F11 in other applications as the key press is intercepted.\n\nA: I think just deleting the lines for F11 may not serve the purpose.\nYou need to replace the contents after action name= to nothing.\nSo, change action name=\"ToggleFullscreen\" to action name=\"\", save the file, and then run openbox --reconfigure in a terminal. There should be no error message if your lubuntu-rc.xml is in good condition! There's no need to reboot. Now, F11 should have no effect as far as Openbox is concerned.\nI don't know about your other programs which also want to use F11 for something else.

I have multiple OpenPGP keys that I am managing with GPG.  The problem is, they have the same user ID and the same e-mail address.  How do I tell GPG the difference when I am, say, encrypting a file?\n\nA: You can always use a key ID instead of a user ID.

Why am I stuck with a version of GNOME Shell unlike KDE? For example, on Ubuntu 12.04 I am stuck with GNOME Shell version 3.4, and I can't upgrade to a newer version of GNOME Shell like 3.6.\nWith Kubuntu 12.04 comes with KDE 4.8 and I can upgrade it to the latest version which is 4.10. It seems like if a version of GNOME Shell gets released after a version of Ubuntu, it does support that version of Ubuntu. Does anyone know why it is like this? Does this have something to do with GTK dependencies? \n\nA: There's a few reasons for this, and it probably comes down to packaging and 'stability'. On a mainstream distribution, its more important to have a system that works reliably than to have the latest packages - as such they often freeze on a major version and add updates gradually.\nThese days kubuntu is maintained by one of the organisations that develops KDE and they can spend the resources integrating more recent versions. On the other hand, Ubuntu uses unity, and gnome 3 isn't really one of the mainline DEs supported by various derivative teams. \nYou could, however, at your own risk, upgrade to a newer version of gnome shell though a PPA. Gnome3's Website mentions these risks - regressions, and links to a staging repo with newer packages.

The dhcpcd package will install a DHCP server, which can be configured in the file /etc/dhcp3/dhcpd.conf. A basic config looks like this (make sure you fill in the correct IP addresses):\n# Configuration for my LAN\nsubnet 192.168.200.0 netmask 255.255.255.0 {\n   option domain-name-servers 192.168.200.100;\n   option routers 192.168.200.1;\n   option ntp-servers 192.168.200.100;\n   option subnet-mask 255.255.255.0;\n   option broadcast-address 192.168.200.255;\n   range 192.168.200.101 192.168.200.200;\n}\n\nSee https://help.ubuntu.com/community/dhcp3-server for more info.\nA well-known DNS server is bind, which is available in the bind9 package. Its configuration is done in /etc/bind/named.conf and /etc/bind/named.conf.options. In its simplest (DNS forwarding form) the latter file looks like this:\noptions {\ndirectory \"/var/cache/bind\";\n     forwarders {\n          // list the IPs of your ISP's DNS servers here\n          xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx; \n          yyy.yyy.yyy.yyy;\n     }\n }\n\nIf you want bind to act as DNS server for your own domain name, configuration gets more complicated.\nSee https://help.ubuntu.com/community/BIND9ServerHowto for more info.\nAlso note that the above configuration is for IPv4. For IPv6 you likely needs some additional settings. \nAlternatively the dnsmasq package provides a simple DHCP and DNS server, see https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Dnsmasq.\n", "Q: Name of the lubuntu screen brightness programme I have lubuntu 13.04 on a couple of year old iMac and using the screen brightness keyboard buttons works great out of the box.

I'm interested if there are other applications which let me read Python documentation offline.\n\nA: Ubuntu provides the documentation for Python and its major libraries as different packages. The documentation is in HTML format and can be viewed in your browser once installed.\nThese documents are installed as a sub-directory in /usr/share/doc/. After installing the packages, we may browse to this folder and open the index.html file contained therein with our Browser and bookmark its location for easy access.\nIt's good to search Ubuntu Software Center for the package of the documentation you want. Use the keywords as:\n\n\n*\n\n*python-<library_name>-doc for documentation relating to Python 2 third-party library; and\n\n*python3-<library_name>-doc for documentation relating to Python 3 third-party library.\n\n\nYou should be able to find them with some trial and error, otherwise Google is your friend.\nExample for installing Python documentation and PyQt4 Reference Guide\nFollowing is an example relating to:\n\n\n*\n\n*Python 2 documentation (which also contains the documentation for its standard library) as found online over here; and\n\n*PyQt4 Reference Guide as found online over here.\n\n\nInstall the documentation package\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get install python-doc python-qt4-doc\n\nAdd as Browser bookmark\nOpen your File Manager and browse to /usr/share/doc/python-doc and look for index.html file to open it with your browser. Then add it as a bookmark.\nSimilarly, browse to /usr/share/doc/python-qt4-doc/html and look for index.html and add that as a bookmark. I would also suggest to bookmark the location of /usr/share/doc/python-qt4-doc/examples for some good example code written in PyQt4.\nYou may follow similar approach for having access to offline documentation for other third-party Python libraries.\n\nA: you could always download the documentation from here. But you need to keep it up-to-date with the online version. \n", "Q: VirtualBox Guest extensions with kernel 3.8.0-31 don't work my Ubuntu 12.04 LTS (running in a VirtualBox on an Windows 7 PC) just updated to kernel 3.8.0-31. \nAfter that I tried to install the vitualbox-guest-additions, but this failed with an error, that no suitable module for the running kernel was found.\nThe make.log said something like: \nCC [M]  /var/lib/dkms/virtualbox/4.1.12/build/vboxdrv/r0drv/linux/initterm-r0drv-linux.o\nCC [M]  /var/lib/dkms/virtualbox/4.1.12/build/vboxdrv/r0drv/linux/memobj-r0drv-linux.o\n/var/lib/dkms/virtualbox/4.1.12/build/vboxdrv/r0drv/linux/memobj-r0drv-linux.c: In function ‘rtR0MemObjNativeMapUser’:\n/var/lib/dkms/virtualbox/4.1.12/build/vboxdrv/r0drv/linux/memobj-r0drv-linux.c:1451:38: error: ‘VM_RESERVED’ undeclared (first use in this function)\n/var/lib/dkms/virtualbox/4.1.12/build/vboxdrv/r0drv/linux/memobj-r0drv-linux.c:1451:38: note: each undeclared identifier is reported only once for each function it appears in\nmake[2]: *** [/var/lib/dkms/virtualbox/4.1.12/build/vboxdrv/r0drv/linux/memobj-r0drv-linux.o] Error 1\nmake[1]: *** [/var/lib/dkms/virtualbox/4.1.12/build/vboxdrv] Error 2\nmake: *** [_module_/var/lib/dkms/virtualbox/4.1.12/build] Error 2\nmake: Leaving directory `/usr/src/linux-headers-3.8.0-31-generic'\n\nWhat can I do?\n\nA: The kernel header package for the running kernel is required to install VirtualBox guest additions (build the dkms module).\nTo fix the problem, install the kernel header for 3.8.0-31-generic and build-essential packages.\nsudo apt-get install linux-headers-$(uname -r) build-essential\n\nMount the Guest Additions ISO (if no X) and install the guest addition by running the install script\nmount /dev/cdrom /media\ncd /media\n/path/to/./VBoxLinuxAdditions.run\n\n", "Q: About hardware support for ubuntu 13.04 I have a question. can i run ubuntu 13.04 in my PC.\nhere my pc spec:\n-amd phenom II x4 955\n-gigabyte 970a-ds3\n-16 GB ddr3 RAM\n-MSI nvidia GTX 650 2gb ddr5\nbefore this i got issue with ubuntu 12.04. i got this message \"Starting load fallback graphics devices [fail]\" and cant login to ubuntu anymore. sry for my bad english and thanks for help. \n\nA: That was probably due to your graphics card being too new at the time of 12.04 release and wasn't supported by the open source or closed source drivers.

After changing the last of them to eth2, and rebooting, everything was back to normal. \n\nA: How to rename Network interfaces:\nHere is one solution, on how to rename the interface. Most likely, there was something which went wrong under the setup of the device, so, let's roll on with it:\nOpen the file \n\n/etc/udev/rules.d/70-persistent-net.rules\n\nAnd look for \"rename3\" in it.\nYou will find this: NAME=\"rename3\" on a pretty long line, so i suggest that you open the file in \"gedit\", and search for that word by pressing ctrl+f.\nCommand for that: sudo gedit /etc/udev/rules.d/70-persistent-net.rules\nWhen you find it, edit it to desired name, like NAME=\"wlan0\" (if not taken) or something, that you can recognize it easily.\nOn the same line, you'll find another parameter called KERNEL==\"rename3\". You don't have to edit this \"kernel\" parameter, as i am unsure myself what it is for. It works without changing that.\nNow save the file, and close it. \n\nAfter doing this, remember also to check your /etc/network/interfaces file to reflect the interface’s name change.\nRestart the service:\n/etc/init.d/networking restart\nDone!\n", "Q: Do I need a graphics card driver for Linux?

In Skype 4.2.0.11 I can't seem to enter Alt Codes with my setup Compose Key that I enabled under Keyboard Layout, my Compose Key is setup to use Left Win key, but when I try to use it in Skype to type accented characters such as áéíóú I can't do it because Skype is ignoring the key input and instead typing regular characters.\nFor every other application I can enter Alt Codes with the Compose Key as normal with no problems such as Text Editors and Web Browsers. All except Skype which ignores it completely, so the question is... How can I force Skype to recognise Alt Codes entered with the Compose Key? Is there a GTK keyboard modifier script I can put into my .bashrc file so it captures the Compose Key input for Skype?\nWhen I don't have the Compose Key for Left Win turned on and just have the default Ctrl + <Alt> keys for inputting Alt codes it works fine in Skype, but I find it a bit impractical and tedious to type them the long way by knowing their Unicode HEX Codes when I could just easily type them quicker with the Compose Key.\nUsing Ubuntu Raring 13.04 ~\n\nA: I'm having a similar problem in Skype 4.2.0.11 on Ubuntu Precise 12.04 LTS. Accented characters can't be composed using the compose key (nothing happens) but other characters in the same chart, like æ <compose>  a  e and ß <compose>  s  s, do work.\nTyping accented characters in other ways works in Skype for me so I have to enable a way to do that. One way is to switch keyboard layout to some other layout which has these characters.\nSince I have the American keyboard layout, my best option is to switch to an \"American international\" keyboard layout. Those layouts have accented characters on the third level, accessible by holding <right alt> (also known as Alt Gr) and type \"a\" for á, <Alt Gr> + e for é, <Alt Gr> + i for í and so on.\nOpen the Keyboard Layout settings, click the plus button to add a layout, filter the list to find a suitable candidate and choose it, click the button resembling a keyboard to see where the characters are. Repeat until you find a layout which is good enough.\nThe third level characters are not sufficient for me, so my choice was \"international AltGr with dead keys\" so I can type <Alt Gr> + `  a for à and <Alt Gr> + 6  o for ô (<Shift> + 6 is ^.)\nIf you don't want to make a permanent switch, you kan add a secondary layout and enabling a key to switch layout. Choosing a key \"when pressed\" will save you the trouble of having to toggle back to your regular layout.\nTo do this, go to the Keyboard Layout settings and enable a key to switch layout (when pressed.) You can optionally set your third level chooser (Alt Gr) on the same button, if your secondary layout of choice has all it's dead keys on the third level.\n", "Q: High CPU Usage Causes Server Power Off My first post here, so apologies if anything is missing.\nI currently have an Ubuntu hosted VPS, which periodically runs a PHP script which does a lot of regex processing and interaction with a local MySQL database (this is running Percona server).\nIt is a dual core VPS, and at one point when the script runs, the processors jump to 100% each for a period of time. I run a mbstat -P 0,1 1 to report the CPU usage, and it is pretty much a minute of high usage, and the server turns itself off - it doesn't shutdown, it powers off. \nMy provider is suggesting that this is a software (OS) problem. I have recently updated the Kernel, but I cannot find anything relating to settings that would cause the server to power down completely.\nI have looked through all the logs I can find (through /var/log anyway) and can't find anything of note. Not even anything in there saying that it's being powered down or there is a problem.

This option does the following:\nWait this many seconds for a key to be pressed before displaying\nthe menu.  If no key is pressed during that time, display the menu\nfor the number of seconds specified in GRUB_TIMEOUT before booting\nthe default entry. We expect that most people who use\nGRUB_HIDDEN_TIMEOUT will want to have GRUB_TIMEOUT set to `0' so\nthat the menu is not displayed at all unless a key is pressed.\nUnset by default.\n\nAs you see it is unset by default, so check whether it has been set or not in your case. \n", "Q: How to turn off geany message window by default?

Thank you! \n\nA: Run Update Manager - install any updates and rebbot of necessary. Check your settings have Long Term Distributions Upgrades enabled. Check for update again and you will see \"New Ubuntu Release 12.04 Available\" - then do an upgrade.\n", "Q: Bumblebee problem after installation Yesterday I was using Kubuntu 13.10. I had a problem using my Intel and Nvidia graphics cards. I thought this was a KDE problem, so I changed distros to Xubuntu. After the installation I installed Steam and it was working. I was happy. I got this error\nERROR: Could not open display :8   \n\nNext I installed an update, and after the update I was trying to install nvidia-prime but after restarting lightdm didn't start. I reinstalled Xubuntu, installed an update, and install the nvidia-319 driver and bumblebee using the following commands:\nsudo apt-get install nvidia-319 nvidia-settings-319\nsudo apt-get install bumblebee linux-headers-generic\n\nI restarted the computer and installed Steam. After Steam started I got an error exactly like the error I got before on Kubuntu. While using the Intel card and running Steam I got this error:\nERROR: Could not open display :8 \n\nNvidia running using bumblebee was giving me a primus error.\nI reinstalled the operating system again and installed updates and Steam is working. \nHow do I install Bumblebee without getting a graphic cards problem? \n\nA: Remove all Bumblebee packages you have installed (along with the nvidia319). Start afresh. Specific instructions for Ubuntu 13.10 version are as follows:\nFrom the Bumblebee on Ubuntu installation wiki-\n\"You need to open your terminal and enter the commands below.\nIf on 12.04.3, replace linux-headers-generic with linux-headers-generic-lts-raring.\nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:bumblebee/stable\n\nEnable the Universe and Multiverse repositories (for bumblebee and nvidia packages respectively).\nsudo apt-get update\n\nInstall Bumblebee using the default proprietary nvidia driver for 12.04 - 13.04 :\nsudo apt-get install bumblebee bumblebee-nvidia virtualgl linux-headers-generic\n\n***And for 13.10 :\nsudo apt-get install bumblebee bumblebee-nvidia primus linux-headers-generic\nReboot*** \"\n\nFirst purge the nvidia-319 you have OR update it ( I didn't do either because Bumblebee handled it for me ). Then follow the highlighted instructions for 13.10. \nThen REBOOT( very important ). If it shows an error like :\"Not added to the Bumblebee group\". Then add yourself using groupadd\nThis should work.\n", "Q: Is this things-to-do-after-installing-ubuntu script safe? I am going to install Ubuntu 12.04, and I wonder if I should trust/run the .sh script proposed on this site: Things to do after Installing Ubuntu 12.04 Precise Pangolin.\nBy the way, do I need to anything in particular after installing Ubuntu?\n\nA: In fact you will learn a lot more if you do the steps one-by-one, rather than just run the .sh script. This also has the advantage that you can check whether the proposed software is still being maintained. To give but one example: today one would no longer advise to install Firestarter.\nAlso, as a general rule you should not trust the internet.\n\nA: The script was originally written of elementary OS Luna, and Ubuntu 12.04. If you're running 14.04, some of those steps are downright harmful, and others simply unnecessary. Examples being:\nHarmful:\n\n*\n\n*Using precise repositories in/etc/apt/sources.list - use trusty if you have to muck around in there. Or the Software Sources GUI.\n\n*Deleting the backup of the sources.list (what sort of guide does that?)\n\nUnnecessary:\n\n*\n\n*Adding PPAs for GIMP, GNOME3 and VLC. All three are in very good shape in Ubuntu 14.04, with no reason for an average user to go gunning after PPAs.\n\n*Adding PPAs for Java. Java 7 is available for Ubuntu 14.04.\n\n*Getting libdvdcss from the VLC repository (see this answer).\n\n*Installing flashplugin-installer - I suggest adobe-flashplugin instead, which comes as a single package instead of downloading extra stuff from the internet.\n\nLastly, if you do install Google Chrome from the command line using the commands from that page, be sure to run sudo apt-get install -f after.\n", "Q: 'mount: error while loading shared libraries: libudev.so.0 : no such file or directory' error while booting I was trying to load a version of CGminer which was returning a libudev type error, and followed a supposed solution here but it destroyed my system (so it seems).\nI loaded the system in recovery mode from GRUB but all that done was actually tell me what I something is broken, do not know what to do next.\nI think I somehow associated a libudev.so.0 to 1 or 1 to 0, I am not sure what I did and how to fix it.\n\nA: I see that some of the solutions posted on the other question overwrite libudev.so.0, because of the -f option supplied to ln. This is not due to malicious intent, but because these solutions were designed for newer versions of Ubuntu, in which the libudev1 package is used. The solution creates libudev.so.0 symbolic link. But in 12.04, libudev0 is used. So the libudev.so.0 library file is overwritten with a broken symbolic link to libudev.so.1 which doesn't exist. The solutions should not have included the -f option for ln in the command line, which overwrites files.\nEnough of the explanation, here is a solution:\nBasically the library file is replaced with a broken symbolic link. Start in recovery mode and select the root shell option. Then run this command: apt-get install libudev0. Once you are done, type exit and reboot. If you are using WiFi, download the libudev0 package and copy it into a USB drive. Then in the root shell in recovery, plug the USB drive and run: (tip: you can use Tab to autocomplete many things, including file paths )\nsudo mount -o remount, rw / # (re)mount the filesystem in read-write mode.\nmkdir /media/usb\nmount /dev/sdb1 /media/usb\ndpkg -i /media/usb/path_to_package_file\n\nThen reboot and hopefully your system should work.\n", "Q: Is there a single line command to do `su`? I can do an su with su <username> and it asks for my password. Is there a password parameter for su such that i wont be prompted for a password?\ne.g. su <username> -p <password>\n\nA: I belive, there is not and it would not be a good idea. Here's why:\nIf you write a password in a command like su <username> -p <password>, it would be stored in plain text in your bash history. This is certainly a huge security issue. \nIf you need to run commands with su (or sudo) in an automated way, write a shellscript containig the commands without su or sudo and run su <username> script.sh\n\nA: If you want to write a script that runs as a different user something like this works, though it dows output the word \"password\" without a newline to standard out\nsu - username <<!\nenterpasswordhere\nenter commands to run as the new user\n!\n\nif you have a user named fred with a password of 1234 and want to get an ls of fred's home directory as fred, without the password string displayed, it would look like\nsu - fred <<! >/dev/null 2>&1\n1234\nwhoami > /dev/tty\nls > /dev/tty\n!\n\n\nA: If you want to execute some specific commands as a new user, use the following command:\nsudo -u {username} {command to be executed as the new user}\n", "Q: Can I install software on a bootable usb key? I have a question.\nSay I make a bootable usbkey, what would happen if I install some software with synaptic ? will it persists over boots (like if it was a real hard drive).\nOr should I create another \"data\" partition on the usb key ?\nRegards\n\nA: In \"Startup Disk Creator\", there is an option called \"Persistence\".

Every now and then, when doing a sudo apt-get dist-upgrade, there goes the message.\nWhat exactly does that mean? And, what can I do to fix it? \n\nA: It means that those modules for the kernel you just installed have not been built. Unless you have a realtek network interface card you don't have to worry about those modules.\nHowever if you want to install the realtek firmware because you do have a realtek card or even just to get rid of those error messages install a package called firmware-realtek.\n", "Q: which java should i use for ubuntu 13.04 64bit I'm new to ubuntu (but i like it a lot), so please bear with me.\nI want to install Java, but which one should I install? \n\n\n*\n\n*The RPM or the normal one? \n\n*32bit or 64bit?\n\n\nFrom what I know, even windows 64 bit is still using java 32 bit.

Sportsdevil (video add-on for live sports) seems not be working in XBMC across other operating system as well, the issue being \"No stream available\", but while there are tutorials about how to fix this problem in XBMC running in Windows, Android and Mac OS, I could not find any for Ubuntu. \nIn Windows there is a directory called app data where programs like XBMC store all their data and in that directory some downloaded fix files must be pasted and so on...\nI read that Ubuntu does not realy have an app data equivalent.\nSo, does anybody know how to address this issue with Sportsdevil ?\nLet me explain more...\nThe zip file to fix Sportsdevil can be downloaded and after extracting it, the folder named catchers and the folder named modules, must be copied where XBMC stores all its data in app data directory. That is the first step BUT this tutorial is for Windows OS. \nPS: I'm fairly new to Linux OS, so if any of you have instructions, please explain them as much as possible in layman terms aka tutorial for stupids. LOL\nThanks a bunch.\n\nA: The nearest equivalent to AppData would be the (hidden) .config in your home directory. You'll find this contains folders with the settings for most commonly used applications.\nHowever, a number of applications like XBMC create their own directory rather than use this one, so you'll find XBMC's settings, database etc in $HOME/.xbmc.\n(You can see hidden directories in the file browser with View->Show Hidden Files).\n", "Q: How to set default terminal to tilda or yakuake when using \"Open in terminal\" from folder When I am inside folder in nautilus I want to be able to open that folder in terminal. This can be done with nautilus-open-terminal package described in Where is 'open in terminal'?\nHowever, I use tilda as my default terminal, because it is drop-down which makes it easy to use. \nSo my question is - how do I use \"Open in terminal\" option to open new tab in tilda instead of default terminal?\nThis question is about opening terminal from folder, not about opening folder from terminal. Opening folder from terminal is easy - you just need to type nautilus . or xdg-open.\nEDIT: Since nothing else worked, I solved this problem by writing nautilus script that outputs current location to text file and then another script (executed from my chosen terminal) that reads that file and uses cd to change directory.\n\nA: You could try this:\nsudo update-alternatives --config x-terminal-emulator\n\nHave you tried this?\nhttps://askubuntu.com/a/76747/164073\n", "Q: Laggy preview for image sequence in all video editing programs in Xubuntu (Kdenlive, Openshot, Sony Vegas via Wine) Current os: Xubuntu 13.04\nAt first I thought it was Kdenlive's problem with not being able to preview image sequence in real time without being laggy, and then the same problem happens with other programs (Openshot, Pitivi) so I thought maybe all native Linux video editing programs just kind of suck, but then even Sony Vegas has the exact same problem, then I'm starting to think maybe I'm doing something wrong. \nI tried to use Kdenlive to preview the image sequence with VMware in another computer and it plays smoothly. So that proves it further that I might have some problem that causes all these video editing program to not be able to preview image sequence smoothly on my computer? Previewing video clips in all these programs are totally fine.\nAnother small note: In both Openshot and Kdenlive, it seems like the preview does play smoothly for about 2 seconds, and then starts to lag.\nI'm using nvidia current driver 304, I tried switching to nouveau just to see if it changes anything -- nope. I tried turning off compiz -- nope. I unticked \"power saving over performance\" and \"spin down hard disk\" from power management settings, still the same laggy image sequence preview.\nI don't understand, my computer is not old. Any ideas?\n\nA: I figured out the problem, and thought I might as well leave this question up if anyone ran into this.\nThe cause was both Compiz and Nvidia's proprietary current driver 304. I had antialiasing and anisotropic filtering set to \"override application settings\", turning it off and set it to \"use application settings\", untick \"Enable FXAA\" and \"Texture sharpening\" fixed the problem. I also found that using Compiz also brought back that original problem back, so I switched it off. The quality of the playback of the image sequence isn't the best, but it's bearable compare to what it was like before which was playing one frame every 30 second.\n", "Q: wireless problem ubuntu 12.04, rfkill commands not working and no internet access via cable I am new to ubuntu and I needed it for some college software.

The way to perform it I thought to be subclassing QWebView class (for example 'MyWebView' extending QWebView) and register that class with\nqmlRegisterType<MyWebView>(uri, 1, 0, \"MyWebView\");\n\nI have created a \"QML Extension Library + Tabbed Touch UI\" application called MyApp to register MyWebView class, when coded, using precreated backend class.

I use an application which doesn't allow any parameters in CLI but I need to test it in two different monitors and screen resolutions so I have two different configuration files. To call needed version I use simple script (name it notebook.sh):\n#!/bin/sh\n\nrm /home/user/.app/config.ini\ncp /home/user/.app/config.ini.1366x768 /home/user/.app/config.ini\nsleep 1\n/usr/local/bin/app &\n\nor second version with cp line changed.\nOK, it's simple. But when I quit this app (Ctrl+Q built-in function) it still runs. Calling ps command I see app and notebook.sh in processes list.\nMy question is: how should notebook.sh script be written to terminate/kill app and script totally? Something like this piece of code:\nif [ \"$1\" = \"start\" ]; then /usr/bin/mplayer -fs -osdlevel 0 $2 ; fi\nif [ \"$1\" = \"stop\" ]; then killall mplayer ; fi\n\n\nA: I offer you a simpler but uglier solution. :-)\nYou can kill a process after an amount of time with a package called timelimit:\nsudo apt-get install timelimit\n\n(on a terminal)\nThe -t option of timelimit is the number of seconds a process will stay alive: after that it will be killed (brutally) with the SIGKILL signal (if you did not specify other signals with the -S option).\ntimelimit OPTIONS command arguments\n\nEdit: IF you want to use a \"professional\" solution, use trap:\ntrap 'kill $(jobs -p)' EXIT\n\nIt will execute the command in the commas after the \"EXIT\" signal.\nTo test it:trap \"yes test\" EXIT ... then use the exit command. Bye.\n", "Q: \"quote\" command in the shell What is the usage of the command quote? I haven't found any info about it, it isn't among the executable files in /bin folders, and it cannot be found among Bash built-ins. It seems that it only prints its first parameter, like an echo command and nothing more.\n\nA: quote is a function:\nquote () \n{ \n    local quoted=${1//\\'/\\'\\\\\\'\\'};\n    printf \"'%s'\" \"$quoted\"\n}\n\nThis function is defined somewhere in a bash initialization file. More precisely, if you are using Ubuntu 13.04, you can find it in /usr/share/bash-completion/bash_completion at the line 142.\nUse the following command to check it:\ntype quote\n\nIts purpose is evidently clear.\n\nA: What is it?\nI noticed that this command does not work in my shell (fish, friendly interactive shell). It seems like it does only work in bash (Ubuntu's default).\nchocobai@pc ~> /bin/bash \nchocobai@pc:~$ quote asdf\n'asdf'chocobai@pc:~$ \n\nchocobai@pc:~$ type quote\nquote is a function.\nquote ()\n{ \n    local quoted=${1//\\'/\\'\\\\\\'\\'};\n    printf \"'%s'\" \"$quoted\"\n}\n\nWhat does it do? What can it be used for?\nIt adds the quotes but no newline. It also escapes single quotes in a way that's suitable for bash. It can be useful in scripts to quote a variable or some other kind of string. You need this for example for paths/parameters with spaces. Although there are other ways to do this.\nIt's really strange I could not find any documentation (in the web) about it. But well, it's easy to see what it does.\n\nA: quote is a function that is defined (here on my Debian system, but I guess it's the same on Ubuntu) in the file /usr/share/bash-completion/bash_completion, which itself is sourced by /etc/bash.bashrc at Bash's startup.\nI would never use this function! If you need to quote stuff so as to be safely usable by a shell, please use printf with the %q modifier, as:\nprintf '%q\\n' \"Hello my friend I like 'single quotes' as well as \\\"double quotes\\\"\"\n\nIn fact, even this is very rarely used, there are always better strategies for high-level stuff as we, users, usually do. This quote thing is used internally by some obscure stuff we don't even want to know about. This quote function is probably a vendor/distribution-specific (read Debian-specific) and is probably not portable at all, and might even change in future releases.\nEdit. I've just checked on an Ubuntu 12.04 system, and the quote function is defined in /etc/bash_completion, sourced by /etc/bash.bashrc, itself sourced by /etc/profile.\nHow did I determine this? using a little of heuristic:\n\n\n*\n\n*Check if quote appears in /etc/profile:\ngrep '\\bquote\\b' /etc/profile\n\nNo. Go to next step.\n\n*What are the files sourced by /etc/profile?\ngrep '[[:space:]]\\.[[:space:]]' /etc/profile\n\nI have $i (need to look into the source for what this sources, but in this case it's the files /etc/profile.d/*.sh if any (and if readable) and /etc/bash.bashrc. Looking in /etc/bash.bashrc.\n\n*Is quote in /etc/bash.bashrc? yes/no , etc...\n\n", "Q: USSD requests via Mobile Broadband Basically what I want to do is to check my balance of my prepaid SIM-Card, which is located in a 3G-Modem (USB).\nSome background information:\n\n\n*\n\n*The provider of my 3G-Internet (called Beeline) is also offering cell phone services. To check the balance on any SIM-Card I can just type *102# on any mobile phone and will receive back a notice of my balance. So what always works is to take out the SIM-Card out of the modem into a cell-phone and check the balance by \"calling\" *102#\n\n*The modem came with a windows-program which has a button \"check balance\". I don't want to try to emulate this program with wine for various reasons. And I don't have to because --Thank Ubuntu-- the modem is running without any problems out of the box.\n\n\nMy thought would be: Is there a possibility of doing these USSD-requests (which don't seem to be a problem with any random phone) via the 3G-Modem through Ubuntu?\n\nA: These \"hash-tag-request\" are called USSD. Searching this keyword you'll find different solutions:\n\n\n*\n\n*Gammu can send USSD request and receive it back via the command gammu getussd *102#. As pointed out here some GSM modems might require a quite complicated transformation of the USSD-code. Make sure you have the rights to read the device /dev/ttyUSB0 (or similar). An example can be found here. \n\n*Gsm-ussd seems to be easier to use than gammu for ussd but has less features overall. It is not in the official repositories, download from here and configure it similar to this.\n\n*Prepaid-manager-applet has nice graphical interface and is in the official repositories. This is probably the easiest and definitely the nicest solution. Chances are that your provider is already listed so you don't have to do anything. If it is not add the USSD-number to '/usr/share/mobile-broadband-provider-info/serviceproviders.xml'. Find the section of your country and provider and add\n<balance-check>\n    <ussd>*102#</ussd>\n</balance-check>\n\nwhereas *102# has to be replaced by your providers USSD-code.\nIt looks as sophisticated as this:\n\n", "Q: screen resolution stuck at 640*480 So I installed 12.10 and I am stuck in 640x480 resolution.

It only depends/recommends other packages. Removing it will not remove Unity or other features.\nSee also: What is the difference between a meta-package and a package?\n\nA: Since ubuntu-desktop's package dependency on file-roller is hard (it Depends, as opposed to Recommends or Suggests), you cannot uninstall file-roller without uninstalling ubuntu-desktop.\nOn the other hand, ubuntu-desktop is a meta-package, so you could achieve the equivalent by installing all packages it depends on, except file-roller, though I doubt that this is worth the effort. \nWhy not keep both installed?\n", "Q: How to prevent etckeeper from saving cups/subscriptions.conf.0 Anacron sends me this message daily:\n/etc/cron.daily/etckeeper:\nCommitting to: /etc/\nmodified cups/subscriptions.conf.O\nCommitted revision 384.\n\nI have added this file to /etc/.bzrignore:\n...\n# end section managed by etckeeper\nsubscriptions.conf\nsubscriptions.conf.O\ncups/subscriptions.conf\ncups/subscriptions.conf.O\n\nbut etckeeper still keeps saving it.

We need the -E option to enable the extended regular expressions for the (one|other) syntax.\nsed approach\nAlternatively, to remove the lines in-place one can use sed -i:\nsed -i \"/\\b\\(cat\\|rat\\)\\b/d\" filename\n\nThe \\b sets word boundaries and the d operation deletes the line matching the expression between the forward slashes. cat and rat are both being matched by the (one|other) syntax we apparently need to escape with backslashes.\nTip: use sed without the -i operator to test the output of the command before overwriting the file.\n(Based on Sed - Delete a line containing a specific string)\n\nA: Using awk to exclude lines containing specific words:\n$ awk '!/\\<(cat|rat)\\>/{print $0}' ./input.txt\n\nawk syntax:\n\n\n*\n\n*!/regex/ Only print lines that do not match regex.\n\n*| Alternation operator, used to specify alternatives.\n\n*(...)

Slightly awkward that you have to write multiple test cases for each word in case statement but portable.

What commands do I type to re-activate the Grub loader?\n\nA: You probably need to adjust the UUIDs specified in the new /etc/fstab file and/or on the kernel command lines in your /boot/grub/grub.cfg file. You'll need to update them to match the UUIDs used on your new filesystems. You can learn these UUIDs with the blkid command, as in:\n$ sudo blkid\n/dev/sda1: LABEL=\"ESP\" UUID=\"804E-E1FD\" TYPE=\"vfat\" PARTLABEL=\"EFI System\" PARTUUID=\"2c47c282-ee6e-45de-a5ad-e8658ca67de6\" \n/dev/sda2: LABEL=\"/boot\" UUID=\"c607bd95-8edf-4eb1-aa93-12db8f0e66a2\" TYPE=\"ext2\" PARTLABEL=\"/boot\" PARTUUID=\"053eca6f-f0d4-41d3-9ee3-9f0155c6183e\" \n/dev/sda3: LABEL=\"untitled\" TYPE=\"hfsplus\" PARTLABEL=\"Unused\" PARTUUID=\"a82773de-b428-4399-8f74-754056fa57cf\" \n/dev/sda4: UUID=\"F0FYTX-mtb3-b8Kw-WZ3I-AhB6-JG3l-yCXWkA\" TYPE=\"LVM2_member\" PARTLABEL=\"Linux LVM data (nessus)\" PARTUUID=\"54c663df-15d9-4060-beb1-24098073d56d\" \n\nThis output is just for the first few partitions on my computer; it's incomplete, but it gets the idea across.

Hi all please assit i am trying to setup open-vpn following this link and currently having some issues. \nEasiest way to setup Ubuntu as a VPN server\nstep 10 where I have to edit the ufw 10: This step assumes you have UFW. Edit /etc/ufw/before.rules, and add the following either at the beginning of /etc/ufw/before.rules or just before the *filter rules (recommended). when the nano editor opened the page was blank i was surprised to see blank screen I still proceeded to enter the details. Not sure if i am in the right track here?.\n\nA: If you'll reread that step in my answer to that question, you'll  notice it says \"add the following either at the beginning of /etc/ufw/before.rules\" in that step.  It also says after that \"or just before the *filter rules\".\nSince there are no rules, follow the first part of that step, and just put the rules into that file, right at the beginning of the file, whether it's blank or not.  That should then work.

I can only change my brightness to a medium level and then it locks there. I'm totally new to ubuntu. I have tried all the fixes I've found on google to avail. Please somebody help me. I was happy to at least get it down from an eye blinding level but I still want more control. Thanks for the input.\n\nA: you can check this folder: /sys/class/backlight/[brightness vendor]/\" and changing the numeral value of the file named backlight to 0 (or your desired backlight level). You can set this as a custom shortcut. (I added a chmod to my local.rc file to grand my system access to changing the value of that file). you can also make a shortcut for adding/substracting 50 or 100 to the brightness setting. Just keep in mind that your shortcut command should be formulated like this\nbash -c \"echo [desired numeral value] > /sys/class/backlight/[backlight vendor]/brightness\"\n\nIf that doesn't work my backlight problems usually get fixxed by changing this line in your grub (/etc/default/grub) \nGRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT=\"quiet splash\"\n\nto\nGRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT=\"quiet splash acpi_backlight=vendor\"\n\n\nA: To resolve the brightness problem on a Lenovo Y500 you should to do the following:\n1. In the file \"/etc/default/grub\" you need to change following string:\n\nGRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT=\"quiet splash\"\n\nto\n\nGRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT=\"quiet splash acpi_backlight=vendor\"\n\n2. Reboot your laptop!\n3. Now you can change the brightness of display with following command (for example we want to set 30% of brightness):\n\necho 30 > /sys/class/backlight/nv_backlight/brightness\n\n4. If you want configure the brightness automatically during booting OS you need the following. After selecting a suitable brightness, add the following command to /etc/rc.local (for example if you have chose 30% of brightness):\n\necho 30 > /sys/class/backlight/nv_backlight/brightness\n\nI have tested this on my Lapton Y500, GeForce GT 750M (Ubuntu 14.04)\n", "Q: Formated xfs partition to ext4 by mistake, can it be recovered?

Without the GRUB bootloader the system will not boot\nI'm trying to install on HP pavilion g6-2303 TX using USB.\nHow do I fix this problem?\n\nA: It's a bug. /pool/main/g/grub2-signed/grub-efi-amd64-signed 1.9~ubuntu12.04.4+1.99-21ubuntu3.10_amd64.deb file rename when you burn it in CD/DVD or usb disk to grub-efi-amd64-signed 1.9~ubuntu12.04.4+1.99-21ubuntu3.10_amd.deb. As a result installation script can't find the file and failed to install grub. Quick workaround is that(if you burn iso in USB flash drive) go to pool/main/g/grub2-signed(in usb flash disk) and rename the deb file manually (add 64). Now boot from usb flash drive and run a disk check to be sure. \n\nA: Re-installing, as Ronshere suggests, is a possibility; however, there's no guarantee that you won't run into the same problem again. Two other options are:\n\n\n*\n\n*Run Boot Repair from an emergency Linux disc. With any luck, this will correct the problem.\n\n*Download the USB flash drive or CD-R version of my rEFInd boot manager. Prepare the medium and boot with it. With any luck, this will enable you to boot Linux. If this works, check to be sure that your EFI System Partition (ESP) is mounted at /boot/efi and install the Debian-package version of rEFInd. You should then be able to boot to Ubuntu via rEFInd, without using the USB flash drive, CD-R, or GRUB.\n\n\nIf these procedures both fail, post back with details, including the URL that the Boot Repair procedure generated.\n\nA: First, boot to your USB and let Ubuntu start a live session. You will see an icon on the desktop that says Install Ubuntu on your desktop.

Make sure you choose the correct drive you want to install Ubuntu on! On that screen you will need to first delete any existing partitions so you can start fresh.\nStart at the bottom of the listed partitions and right click on each one and choose Delete.

I don't seem to have write access to much outside of ~/, but I was just thinking exactly what damage can a new user do without having been added to the sudo group?\nShould I be taking more precautions and locking down the user further?\n\nA: In principle, a user created in that way cannot do any damage outside his/her own home directory. As you noticed, a regular user does have access to various directories (e.g. in /, /usr/, /tmp). This is a necessity, because most user-accessible programs are located in /usr/bin and /bin. If the user didn't have (read-only) access to these directories, he/she wouldn't be able to run any programs. \nHowever, a regular user doesn't have accesss to home directories of other users. \nYou can use the ls -l command to see permissions on a file or directory.

See for http://www.pizzashack.org/rssh/ and http://www.cyberciti.biz/tips/linux-unix-restrict-shell-access-with-rssh.html for the rssh tool, which limits the user to only run copying tools like scp and rsync.

Input/output error during write on /dev/sda I've encountered this a few times so I've tried both of either clicking ignore and clicking Retry. If I click ignore then I eventually get to the second error described below.\nSecond error:\n The creation of swap space in partition #5 of scsl1(0,0,0)(sda) failed\n\nOnce this error is recieved I am recieve no further instructions from the installer, as if I never tried to install to begin with. And then on future attempts to boot from USB thumbdrive I have to manually (thinkpad button + F12) tell the machine to boot from USB or a blinking white line will just stare at from the corner until I forcibly power down.\nBut back to the original issue; it probably is important to note that I recently removed a Toshiba hard disk from an Imitation external hard drive and installed it in the Thinkpad. The external hard drive was working fine before so I'm inclined to think the hard drive in the Lenovo should still be functioning.\nI tried to use the Ubuntu supported SMART technology but I'm not sure if this Toshiba hard disk supports it. If it's important I can post the model #; all I remember is that it operates at 5400 rpm and can hold around 320GB.\nI'm thinking about using the Thinkpad's hard drive test utility but wanted to see if I could get any info from this Ubuntu forum in parallel. \nThis is my first attempt at using/installing Ubuntu so please take that in consideration when responding with recommendations. I'm a quick learner though so also don't feel like you have to leave out in detail.\nThanks in advance to any insights anyone has to offer.\n\nA: The error \"The creation of swap space in partition #5 of scsl1(0,0,0)(sda) failed\" is probably because of something to do with your partition settings. If you are dual booting make a note of which drive your windows and other important are installed and either format or delete partitions that you may have created erroneously. Use Gdisk partitioner to view which partitions need editing. \nAlso remember to allocate enough swap space when installing.  \n\nA: I just answered 2 questions and they apply to your situation.\nYou need to properly partition the hard drive. The message you posted\ntells me it is not right.\nSo here is a copy of my reply about how to partition the drive to install ubuntu\n\nIt is possible that your hard drive is not formatted. \nYou need to start Ubuntu again from your CD or flash drive \nbut do not try to install it yet! When you get to the desktop \nyou need to start a program called Gparted. If it is not there\nthen open up package manager and install it.\n\nNow run Gparted and see if it detects your hard drive. \nIf it does then delete any partitions that are on it first. \nThen click Apply. Now you need to create a new partition table \nso you will click on Device (at the top of Gparteds screen) \nthen click on Create Partition Table and choose the entire drive \nfor a new partition. Then click Apply again and you should see \nthat the drive is correctly partitioned. This will make it easy \nfor ubuntu to see it. Now the Ubuntu install can go ahead.\n\nHowever, I think you need to read my other reply as it tells \nhow to set up a good partition table for ubuntu to run on.\n\nHello It would be easiest to just start from the beginning so lets do that, okay?First, boot to your USB and let Ubuntu start a live session. You will see an icon on the desktop that says Install Ubuntu on your desktop. Launch (click on) it. \nWhen you get to the screen where it asks you if you want to replace an existing install or install next to it or Something Else, choose Something Else.\nNow you will see a screen that will let you see the hard drive you want to install to. Make sure you choose the correct drive you want to install ubuntu on! On that screen you will need to first delete any existing partitions so you can start fresh.\nStart at the bottom of the listed partitions and right click on each one and choose Delete. After you have done this to all the partitions, click on Apply. When you have deleted everything your drive will show as completely unallocated space! Sometimes some partitions cannot be deleted right away  so delete all you can at first and click Apply, then start over from the bottom until they are all deleted.\nNow you want to create the necessary partitions for you to install Ubuntu.\nCreate the following partitions. \n1. a boot partition /boot and give it 250mb of space, choose ext4 for the format.\n2. a root partition /root and give it 15000mb of space and ext4 format \n3. a swap partition /swap and give it 4096mb of space (it will format to swap) \n4. a home partition /home and give it the rest of the space and format it to ext4.\nNow just finish the install and it will run beautifully.\n", "Q: After removed lubuntu-desktop, still got lubuntu lockscreen I installed lubuntu-desktop, removed it, and now I still got the lubuntu lockscreen.\nSince yesterday it is even worse, now when I unlock my session I have the unlock screen from lubuntu, then the one of ubuntu !\n(I installed lubuntu-desktop)\n\nA: In fact sudo apt-get remove lubuntu-desktop doesn't remove all the lubuntu stuff.\nI had to list all the packages containing lubuntu : dpkg --get-selections | grep -v deinstall\nAnd remove them.\n", "Q: Is it possible to know from apt if the package was installed explicitly or as a dependency of another package? Let's say there are A, B and C package.\nA and C were installed manually with apt-get install, and B is a dependency of A and was installed by apt automatically.\nIs it possible to know that with some apt-* or dpkg command?\n\nA: You can check whether a package was installed manually by displaying the list of all automatically installed packages with apt-mark showauto.\napt-mark showauto | grep -x B\n\naptitude -v why B shows which packages depend on B. Sticking with aptitude, aptitude version B displays an A in the third column if B is marked as automatically installed.\napt-cache show A or dpkg -s A (if A is installed) shows A's dependencies. apt-cache rdepends B shows what depends on B.\n", "Q: Installing Ubuntu I have an old computer and wanted to install Ubuntu 12.04.3. My problem is it won't even detect the Hard Drive to install the OS after the screen displays the Ubuntu install screen. I am new to Linux and wish to learn more about it, but installing it just gives me a black screen, doesn't show that it is installing, and stays on this black screen with letters from the HD sectors. Please help.\n\nA: If you suspect that the problem could be due age, then you could always try Ubuntu on a live USB stick. Make sure that you are using the latest version available and you have enough space on the memory stick. Personally I recomend anything with 4gb and over to eliminate memory issues.\n\nA: It is possible that your hard drive is not formatted.

I'm new to Linux and am trying to put Ubuntu on a Presario 6000. \nI burned Ubuntu onto a DVD and put it in the optical drive, but it keeps saying:\n\nNon-System disk\n\nor \n\nDisk error, replace and strike any key when ready\n\nI'm not sure what to do because still trying to learn more about computers and operating systems.\n\nA: Presario 6000? It might be a little poky with standard Ubuntu or Kubuntu, but it will be fast enough with Xubuntu or Lubuntu.  Ubuntu (with GNOME) and Kubuntu (KDE) will use more horsepower and memory; Xubuntu and Lubuntu use less memory and might be better choices. Your mileage will vary, of course.\n\nSounds as if the DVD was either\n 1) Burned on a DVD-RW disc, and those can't be a System disc, or\n 2) Was not burned as a bootable disc, or \n 3) The disc didn't record properly. \nThe first is easy to check; eject the disc, and does it say DVD-RW on it? If so, then reuse it for some other purpose.\n\nSome Windows apps don't make bootable discs. You might also have recorded it in non-bootable mode. If the program you use offered to let you add more to the disc later, well, that isn't doing to make a bootable disc. Instead, make sure the disc you burn 'finalizes' the disc. http://cdburnerxp.se/ and http://www.imgburn.com/ are free apps which do burn bootable CD and DVD discs.\n\nSometimes, a blank disc is bad, or there's dust on it and it doesn't record properly,, and in either of those cases, discard it and try again. \n\nA: Are you changing your BIOS on boot up? You have to boot computer from optical drive. \nhttp://pcsupport.about.com/od/fixtheproblem/ss/bootorderchange.htm\nThis is usually dependant on your machine. For me to change BIOS, I have to press F2 at boot up screen, which then takes me to boot manager.\n\nA: The copy you made is not right. Something went wrong making it.\nGet a free program called IMGBURN. Use that to burn Ubuntu to a DVD. It will correct everything for you before it starts. Then make sure the Presario is booting to your newly created copy of Ubuntu (look in the bios to be sure). You should have no more problems.\n", "Q: I have major problem and need to save my laptop My brightness was not working, I was trying to find a solution, well it was a bad call.

The unload-module command gets rid of the recording one but I can't find a command for the outputs.\n\nA: The appropriate way to unload modules\nUnloading a module loaded to Pulse Audio is done by the module's index number, which is given on loading:\npactl load-module module-null-sink sink_name=test\n24\n\nIn the above example Pulseaudio server loaded the module with index id 24. This module can be unloaded with the following command:\npactl unload-module 24\n\nYour script will have to parse the output of pactl.\nIn case we do not know the module number we can issue the following command which will display the number and the module name:\npactl list short modules\n\nNewer versions also allow unloading by name:\npactl unload-module <name>\n\n\nThe quick and dirty method\nIf pulseaudio is set up as auto-spawning demon (which should be the default begaviour) we may quickly unload all modules loaded after login with a reset of the PulseAudio server to load the default modules defined in our default.pa by running:\npulseaudio -k\n\nThis will effectively unload all modules from your script and will load the default sink for output.\n", "Q: Lenovo X131e Chromebook Ubuntu installation Has anyone been able to successfully install Ubuntu on a Lenovo X131e Chromebook?  I'm able to run the scripts and install it but after it completes the install I cannot get Ubuntu to start, it just starts in Chrome.  It partitions the SSD for sure because I can see it in the Chrome OS.  Any ideas on how to get it to start or a proper way to install?\n\nA: I'm assuming you want the LTS (long term support) version of ubuntu.\nThere is a tool developed for this. It's called crouton.\nSince chromeOS is based on linux you'll be able to switch with a simple keyboard shortcut (if you want you can also make it a more traditional dualboot (you'll want this script if you want to do that) but this is imho better.\nFirst things first: make a backup of all the files you want to save that are not in the cloud (because they WILL be lost).\n2) Press and hold the Esc and Refresh keys together, then press the Power button (while still holding the other two keys). This will reboot your Chromebook into Recovery Mode.\n3) When you get the yellow screen with the exclamation mark hit ctrl + d (This will bring up a prompt asking if you want to turn on Developer Mode.) Press enter (this will take about 15 to 20 min. You'll get a screen with a red exclamation mark but leave it be until it reboots into chromeOS).\n4) Download crouton\n5) press ctrl + alt + T and you'll get a terminal (linux uses the same shortcuts)\n6) type \"shell\" (without the quotation marks) to get a ubuntu shell\n7) type this command\nsudo sh -e ~/Downloads/crouton -t xfce\n\n(if you have a touch screen you'll want to change that to include the touch functions)\nsudo sh -e ~/Downloads/crouton -t touch,xfce\n\nif you want the unity desktop then change xfce for unity\nif you want another release then run this to give you a list of the recognized releases and which distros they belong to.\nsh -e ~/Downloads/crouton -r list\n\n8) Let it run. (when it's done it'll ask you for a new username and password)\n9) run this command to start your new environment.\nsudo startxfce4\n\n10) Now, you can switch back and forth between Chrome OS and Ubuntu using Ctrl+Alt+Shift+Back and Ctrl+Alt+Shift+Forward (if you're on an ARM-based Chromebook) or Ctrl+Alt+Back and Ctrl+Alt+Forward (If you're on an Intel-based Chromebook). In the latter case, you will also need to press Ctrl+Alt+Refresh after pressing Ctrl+Alt+Forward to bring up the desktop. To exit the Linux desktop, just log out of it like you would on a normal PC—you'll close it completely and go back to Chrome OS (after which you can run sudo startxfce4 again to go back).\nif you experience problems the crouton link on the top redirects you to the official crouton page including a troubleshooting page\n", "Q: What version of Ubuntu is right for my computer?

Every time I plug in my USB printer for VMware Workstation 9 to use (Windows 7 guest OS), Ubuntu 13.04 (the host) launches usblp and grabs the printer.

I'd like to stop Ubuntu's usblp from doing this. (I never want the printer used on the Linux host, just in the Windows guest.)\nGoogling this question produces only answers that are 5+ years old and don't work, like running modprobe -r usblp, which doesn't stop usblp from being invoked, or editing /etc/hotplug/blacklist, when /etc/hotplug doesn't seem to exist for Ubuntu 13.04.\nThe guest OS does have focus when I connect the printer, so that's not the problem. I also looked in VMware Workstation's \"VM / Removable Devices\" menu but didn't see anything obvious to affect the problem.\nDoes anyone have a modern way to suppress or disable usblp that works for Ubuntu 13.04?\nThank you very much.\n\nA: If you want to blacklist usblp you could put it in /etc/modprobe.d/blacklist.conf, or add your own .conf file to /etc/modprobe.d\nOverall blacklisting isn't a very satisfying even if it works for you.\n", "Q: Wubi install fail because of \"substring not found\" Every time I try to install Wubi, I get a missing substring\nlast parts of the install log always state the same thing \"substring not found\".\nThoughts?\nlast part of wubi-12.04.3-rev279: \n10-07 20:52 DEBUG  WindowsBackend: total size=30000\n  root=29744\n  swap=256\n  home=0\n  usr=0\n10-07 20:52 DEBUG  TaskList: ## Finished choose_disk_sizes\n10-07 20:52 DEBUG  TaskList: ## Running expand_diskimage...\n10-07 20:53 DEBUG  TaskList: ## Finished expand_diskimage\n10-07 20:53 DEBUG  TaskList: ## Running create_swap_diskimage...\n10-07 20:53 DEBUG  TaskList: ## Finished create_swap_diskimage\n10-07 20:53 DEBUG  TaskList: ## Running modify_bootloader...\n10-07 20:53 DEBUG  TaskList: New task modify_bcd\n10-07 20:53 DEBUG  TaskList: ### Running modify_bcd...\n10-07 20:53 DEBUG  WindowsBackend: modify_bcd Drive(C: hd 785689.058594 mb free ntfs)\n10-07 20:53 ERROR  TaskList: substring not found\nTraceback (most recent call last):\n  File \"\\lib\\wubi\\backends\\common\\tasklist.py\", line 197, in __call__\n  File \"\\lib\\wubi\\backends\\win32\\backend.py\", line 695, in modify_bcd\nValueError: substring not found\n10-07 20:53 DEBUG  TaskList: # Cancelling tasklist\n10-07 20:53 DEBUG  TaskList: New task modify_bcd\n10-07 20:53 ERROR  root: substring not found\nTraceback (most recent call last):\n  File \"\\lib\\wubi\\application.py\", line 58, in run\n  File \"\\lib\\wubi\\application.py\", line 132, in select_task\n  File \"\\lib\\wubi\\application.py\", line 158, in run_installer\n  File \"\\lib\\wubi\\backends\\common\\tasklist.py\", line 197, in __call__\n  File \"\\lib\\wubi\\backends\\win32\\backend.py\", line 695, in modify_bcd\nValueError: substring not found\n10-07 20:53 DEBUG  TaskList: New task modify_bcd\n10-07 20:53 DEBUG  TaskList: ## Finished modify_bootloader\n10-07 20:53 DEBUG  TaskList: # Finished tasklist\n\n\nA: Here is the failure (reference):\ncommand = [bcdedit, '/create', '/d', '%s' % self.info.distro.name, '/application', 'bootsector']\nid = run_command(command)\nid = id[id.index('{'):id.index('}')+1]\n\nSo basically it's running the command:\nbcdedit /create /d Ubuntu /application bootsector\n\nwhich is supposed to add an entry to the Windows Boot Manager (BCD Store) for Ubuntu and return a response that contains the GUID for the entry e.g.\n{2e05fa55-5f6e-11e2-a7cc-95d88d2d9736}\n\nBut it seems that the command fails.

I've also moved the references to linux-image-3.5.0-21-generic.* and linux-image-extra-3.5.0-22-generic.* that were in /var/lib/dpkg/info into my new tmp dir. \nIt seems to me that there isn't any place where vmlinuz-3.5.0-21-generic can be on my system. I can't find any when searching all files for anything containing 3.5.0-21. I still can't use initramfs, which implies that I can't update/upgrade my system, install new packages, or fix a few other issues that sprung up when I upgraded to 13.04. \nWhat follows is (some of) my output from:\n$ sudo update-initramfs -u -v\nAvailable versions:  3.8.0-31-generic 3.5.0-41-generic\nKeeping /boot/initrd.img-3.8.0-31-generic.dpkg-bak\nupdate-initramfs: Generating /boot/initrd.img-3.8.0-31-generic\nAdding module /lib/modules/3.8.0-31-generic/kernel/drivers/hid/hid.ko\n...

What can I do to get past this? I really don't want to resort to completely reinstalling my system, is there any other way to fix this?\n\nA: I fixed the issue, and can now update my system as normal. However, I still dont understand how this issue began.\nIn any event, I went ahead and installed both the first listed missing kernel, 3.5.0-21. I have since edited this aspect of the question out, but after getting 3.5.0-21 installed, initramfs began whining about 3.5.0-17. So I decided I had delt with this issue and allowed it to consume way too much of my time, and backed up all my data, and prepared for the worst but hoped for the best.\nI figured out how to download old/deprecated linux kernel/headers by searching for them on packages.ubuntu.com. I then edited my /etc/apt/sources.list file to allow the candidate versions associated with these two linux images to be downloaded. I then ran 'sudo apt-get update' to update the sources. Then I was able to run 'sudo apt-get download linux-image3.5.0-##-generic' and succesfully installed both packages. \nAfter this, all my apt-get commands continued to function, I managed to get the latest updates to 13.04 installed and also all of my other user software updated. \nThen, after restart, my mouse and keyboard were no longer responding! My grub menu disappeared! I couldnt get tty terminal up, or do anything really. From my windows computer, I downloaded a 13.10 image, created a usb flash ubuntu boot disk, and rescued grub after booting from this flash volume. After rescuing grub, I was able to boot into recovery mode, and fix any bad packages or whatever it was that happened. After rebooting into my machine, I could log in with full mouse and keyboard. Now my system seems stable and whoa am I amazed at what a learning experience this all is. \n", "Q: Can't Connect to Internet, just installed ubuntu I just installed Ubuntu on Dell Mini that I had laying around, and the install went perfectly fine except for the fact that I cannot connect to my wireless internet.\nWhen I click the network button in the top bar it doesn't display any networks to connect to.

That is, there must be at least one newline after \"END\" or sed will not get to see it. (This is precisely why it is good practice to always end text files with a newline.)\nThen of course, there is always the rough way.

I want to install Ubuntu on the empty drive without erasing anything from the other one. Is there a way?\nI don't know about GRUB either, so can you guys help me?\n\nA: In general you can just follow the instructions Hany gave you, but since you want to install them on two discs you should check the something else option in the installation process. Now you should make all partitions needed. In this article they describe the partitions, they choose to make a separate /home partition, this is sometimes useful because all your application settings en personal documents are saved there, and when you reinstall these remain untouched. but you can also just make a /boot, a swap and a / partition (just fill all the left over space with /)\n", "Q: In iptables is it possible to restrict by gateway? Using iptables it is possible to add a DROP action for some particular source IP and/or destination IP. I want to know if it is possible to DROP a packet based on (default) gateway used?\nThe iptables will be present on the gateway itself and the DROP rules will be added to the FORWARD chain.\n\nA: No, not really.\nThe gateway address or default route is only used to choose which interface to send a packet out of and which destination MAC address to use. \nAn incoming packet contains no information at all about which gateway address the sender used to deliver it. You can only make inferences based on what you know about the topology and interface configuration.  \nIf the destination MAC address only has one IP address associated with it, you can infer that the sender used that IP address to find the MAC address. If you drop packets which have that interface's MAC address, but not that interface's IP address, as the destinations for the frame and packet, you can infer that the sender used that interface's address as the gateway. \nIf the destination MAC address is on an interface which has multiple addresses in the same subnet, it's impossible to detect which of those addresses the sender used as their gateway. \n", "Q: Wifi gets hardware-disabled after waking from sleep I have an HP 14-b015dx device.

If I understand right, Upstart runs all tasks that are ready to run in parallel.\nHowever, is there a way to limit the amount of parallelisation? That is, the number of parallel tasks that are run should be capped by some constant.\nFor example, make allows you to run all tasks in parallel with the -j option. If you want to restrict the amount of parallel jobs, you can pass a number to it. Thus, -j 2 means run jobs in parallel but not more than two at a time.\nI am looking for the equivalent setting in upstart.\nEdit\nI just realized that my question is silly. If the jobs are daemons that never stop, then there is no way for Upstart to decide that they are done.\nInstead, what I need is a way to limit by disk i/o. That is, when disk i/o is high, upstart shouldn't spawn new jobs. It should only spawn after disk activity cools down.\n\nA: Have you looked at upstarts documentation? I strongly suggest to you to skim through it. It can be found here.\nOne simple way could be to delay some between each start or use a post-start script to delay until your service is up before you start next instance? Have a look at some of the examples to get some ideas how to handle it.

I read somewhere that it could be the kernel update that causing it, so this time I didn't do the kernel update. It was ok this time until I rebooted after the updates, but after the reboot they again stopped working.\nOnly the touch pad enable/disable and screenshot keys are working now.\nI tried installing samsung-tools, samsung-laptop, nothing changed.\nAlso when I go in to System Settings->Keyboard->Shortcuts and edit a shortcut, actually it recognizes the key, for example when I hit Fn + F8 it shows as \"Audio raise volume\".\nPlus, when this problem with the function keys occurs, there's always a slight change in the graphics, like in firefox and vlc player the buttons are more edgy than before. It looks like something messed with the themes or something.\nThanks in advance\nedit: When I run gnome-settings-daemon it returns the output below and crashes.\n=== xinerama setup Configuration ===\n  Clone: false\n  Output: Laptop attached to LVDS-0\n     status: on\n     width: 1600\n     height: 900\n     rate: 60\n     primary: true\n     position: 0 0\n  Output: (null) attached to VGA-0\n     status: off\n     width: -1\n     height: -1\n     rate: -1\n     primary: false\n     position: -1 -1\n  Output: (null) attached to HDMI-0\n     status: off\n     width: -1\n     height: -1\n     rate: -1\n     primary: false\n     position: -1 -1\n  Output: (null) attached to DisplayPort-0\n     status: off\n     width: -1\n     height: -1\n     rate: -1\n     primary: false\n     position: -1 -1\n=== Applying Configuration Configuration ===\n  Clone: false\n  Output: Laptop attached to LVDS-0\n     status: on\n     width: 1600\n     height: 900\n     rate: 60\n     primary: true\n     position: 0 0\n  Output: (null) attached to VGA-0\n     status: off\n     width: -1\n     height: -1\n     rate: -1\n     primary: false\n     position: -1 -1\n  Output: (null) attached to HDMI-0\n     status: off\n     width: -1\n     height: -1\n     rate: -1\n     primary: false\n     position: -1 -1\n  Output: (null) attached to DisplayPort-0\n     status: off\n     width: -1\n     height: -1\n     rate: -1\n     primary: false\n     position: -1 -1\n\n(gnome-settings-daemon:2955): Gdk-WARNING **: The program 'gnome-settings-daemon' received an X Window System error.\nThis probably reflects a bug in the program.\nThe error was 'BadMatch (invalid parameter attributes)'.\n  (Details: serial 274 error_code 8 request_code 140 minor_code 30)\n  (Note to programmers: normally, X errors are reported asynchronously;\n   that is, you will receive the error a while after causing it.\n   To debug your program, run it with the GDK_SYNCHRONIZE environment\n   variable to change this behavior.

The password is asked every time you boot.\nThis seems to be a great deal, easy, convenient, really nice except one thing - I don't think that it is so necessary to encrypt the whole installation. It would be nice to set up separate partitions for private information (like /var and /home) and keep them encrypted while leaving system files (all binaries, mans, etc.) unencrypted. I think it should be nice not so much for performance but for SSD life-time and stability.\nSo, the password is asked on every boot like it has the whole installation encrypted, but actually only several partitions are encrypted.\nIs there a way to set that up smoothly during installation? And what do you think about all that? Please advise.\n\nA: Possibly the easiest way to achieve what you ask is to do an install without encryption and afterwards set up ad hoc encryption on specific folders. The Community documentation suggests encfs for the task. A plugin exists to integrate encfs with Nautilus.\nEcryptfs is an alternative that facilitates the specific encryption of users' home folders.\n\nA: You might also consider moving /home and /var to their own partitions and then just encrypt those; but IMHO the possibility of improved SSD life is negligible, and you will still be prompted to password in at boot for booting requires access to /root. \n\nIf you want the SSD to last longer, add more system RAM and do without swap. That's what I did and it works well for me.\n", "Q: How do I Install 0 A.D.?

PPA, usually, only holds packages for supported Ubuntu releases, not End of Life (EOL) releases.\nNote: In the newest Ubuntu, it also sports the latest 0 A.D. version. But, when a new release of 0 A.D. is out, you will need to add the PPA to update it. Ubuntu updates packages per a new Ubuntu release, with some exceptions. Read more about it here.\n\nSnappy (package manager)\nNext to the PPA, you can use snap to install 0 A.D. in a secure environment.\nsudo snap install 0ad\n\nIf you haven't installed snap, please see the installation guide: Installing snap on Ubuntu | Snapcraft documentation\n\nflatpak\nTo install 0 A.D. using flatpak, from the flathub repo, you need to have flatpak installed on Ubuntu, after you have installed flatpak, you can then install 0 A.D. from the flathub repo, like so:\nflatpak remote-add --if-not-exists flathub https://flathub.org/repo/flathub.flatpakrepo\n\nFor detailed information, see the flathub documentation.\nAfter the installation of the flathub repo, you can install 0 A.D.:\nflatpak install flathub com.play0ad.zeroad\n\n\nWhat is 0 A.D.\n\n\"0 A.D.

In\nshort, it is a historically-based war/economy game that allows players\nto relive or rewrite the history of Western civilizations, focusing on\nthe years between 500 B.C. and 500 A.D. The project is highly\nambitious, involving state-of-the-art 3D graphics, detailed artwork,\nsound, and a flexible and powerful custom-built game engine.\" - Wildfire Games\n\n\n0 A.D. is a free and open-source RTS game for a variety of Linux distributions (although it is also available for macOS and Windows NT) including Arch Linux, Debian, Fedora, Gentoo Linux, openSUSE and Slackware. Despite this, it is still in alpha stage!\nThat being said, I noticed lag only on a low end PC/laptop. On a high end laptop, it took about 1000 units walking around my view to experience 'some' lag.\n\n\nPersonal pick. For more see: 0 A.D. media/wallpapers\n\n\nFeatures\nBelow are some of the features available for 0 A.D.\nIntense Gameplay\n\n*\n\n*Cross-platform: 0 A.D. is set to run on Linux, macOS (specifically 10.7 and later) and Windows NT (specifically XP and later).\n\n*Unique civilizations: In 0 A.D. each civilization is unique in its appearance and game-play, including units, structures, and technology trees.\n\n*Citizen soldiers: Some infantry and cavalry units can not only fight, but also gather resources and construct buildings, making them substantially more versatile than in typical RTS games.\n\n*Combat experience matters: The more time your citizen soldiers spend fighting your enemies, the higher they go up the ranks. With each rank, they become stronger, but they also get worse at civilian tasks.\n\n*Technology tradeoffs: Some technologies are arranged in pairs, and within each pair, you can only research one technology at most in each game. This choice is irreversible, so choose carefully!\n\n*Unit formations: Arrange your units in historical battle formations from the Phalanx to the Testudo and gain bonuses, such as increased armor. However, beware the costs that may come with them, such as lower speed! (As of August 2012, this feature has not been implemented yet.)\n\nRealism and Authenticity\n\n*\n\n*Real world map realism: Random maps are based upon real geography of the ancient world with realistic plants, animals and terrain.\n\n*Authentic historical details: Designs of units, buildings and technologies all reflect the hallmarks of each civilization. We even give them names in the original ancient Greek, Latin, Punic, Celtic, etc.\n\n*Lifelike naval warfare: Ships will be on a much larger and more lifelike scale than seen in other games. They will move more realistically and even be able to ram other ships. (As of August 2012, this feature has not been implemented yet.)\n\nMake the game your own\n\n*\n\n*Translation and locale support: Play 0 A.D. in over a dozen languages.\n\n*Powerful map editor: Draw landscapes with a palette of hundreds of terrains, build majestic cities and set the position of the sun in the Atlas Editor, your tool to design intricately detailed maps in 0 A.D.\n\n*Excellent moddability: From new computer opponent behaviors to extra civilizations, easily create your own modifications (mods) of 0 A.D. by editing game files, all freely available in standard, open formats. You can install them by moving their contents to /usr/share/games/0ad/mods/<MODNAME>, where <MODNAME> is to be replaced with the name of the mod you are installing. You can find information on community-provided mods and download links for them, here.\n\n0 A.D.

How do I schedule the reloading of a page when using a terminal browser?\nusing any of: Elinks, w3m etc\n\nA: As far as I know, these browsers do not support programmed reloading, however it can easily be accomplished by using a terminal multiplexer like tmux. For example if you start the browser in one terminal like this:\ntmux new-session -s browse 'w3m google.com'\n\nThen you can send commands to it from a script or another terminal with the send-keys command. So to make w3m reload the current page do this:\ntmux send-keys -t browse R\n\n\nA: Unlike Lynx the w3m browser can reload a page, when the page has the meta-refresh tag in its header. You just have to enable it in w3m's config file: Look for \"meta_refresh 0\" and change the value to \"1\": https://www.computerhilfen.de/english/w3m-browser-activate-meta-refresh.html\nIf a webpage has the meta-refresh-tag, it will reload it with the given time: Here the time is three seconds and the URL is https://askubuntu.com:\n<meta http-equiv=\"refresh\" content=\"3; URL=https://askubuntu.com\">\n\n", "Q: How can I create ISOs quickly using all 16 cores of a Parallella board? I have a large video collection (over 900 disks). Using Handbrake to rip to .mp4 is painfully slow, especially when ripping BRD. I found another solution that will play back ISOs, but I want to be able to do this very quickly.  How can I get Ubuntu, running on a 16-core Parallella board, to use all cores to get the job done FAST?\n\nA: Video conversion is not something that scales out that well and I strongly suspect it's not something that the Parallella board is going to excel at. The best encoding needs a big beefy CPU and a lot of time.\nI've just done all the sums. To do this you would need:\n\n\n*\n\n*450+ hours of your time to extract raw video from discs\n\n*~$3k in AWS compute time (using their elastic transcoder), including transfer via disks\n\n\nOr you could do it at home on demand but a 1KW computer taking ~2hours a go... That's an additional 1800 hours (just over two months) and £226 in electricity.\nI think a much better solution is to find the most local disc ripping service. That one will charge £1 a disc. Sure that's over a grand once you factor in your storage (a couple of 4TB drives should do it), but it's only 30 minutes of your time while you send it.\n\nAs for making ISOs, you're still in the position of extracting everything... Which again, is 450+ hours of disk juggling and waiting for data to transfer. If your time isn't worth anything, that might be okay but CPU time isn't the limiting factor here, it's transfer speed between the optical drive and hard disk.\nIf you're willing to sink that much time in, I'd go with something like MakeMKV which will convert the disk into a MKV video without any re-encoding. That is again something that won't benefit from many CPUs but most modern hardware network players can handle MKVs so it's a lot more useful than an ISO.\nBut as I say, any operation that involves you feeding 900 disks to a computer is going to require a few months of your time (years if you don't focus on it). \n", "Q: Microsoft Explorer Touch Mouse compatibility Is the Microsoft Explorer Touch Mouse fully compliant with Ubuntu?

Worth noting is that I'm doing this on a computer at my university, and I don't have access to su or sudo commands. In order to generate a wrapper file I enter\ngcc -fpic -c output_test.c interface_wrap.c \\ -I/usr/bin/Python2.7\n\nThis line works perfectly when setting up PyDev on Eclipse, but doesn't work here, which, as far as I can tell from googling the problem, can be solved by installing python-dev. So I downloaded python-dev, v. 2.7.3 for ubuntu and unpacked it. I have been unable to find any guide whatsoever that describes a manual installation of python-dev, so I'm pretty much stuck here. After the unpacking, then what? Looking at the unpacked folders, I am able to find that there are two files in the ~/python-dev/usr/bin-folder:\n\n\n*\n\n*python-config\n\n*python2-config\n\n\nNeither is executable. In fact, Ubuntu treats them as broken links. So what am I supposed to do at this point? And why is there such a lack of a comprehensible guides for installing this?\n\nA: You need some more packages. This should get you all you need (I didn't try to compile anything with it):\napt-get download libpython2.7-dev libpython-dev python2.7-dev python-dev\n\n(you don't need sudo for that).\nNow unpack the downloaded .deb files into ~/python-dev (this assumes you don't have any other .deb files in your current working directory):\nfor i in *.deb; do dpkg -x \"$i\" ~/python-dev; done\n\nNow everything should be in your ~/python-dev/usr/ tree. \n", "Q: Run wine command from python I have Apache that serves a web service with a python script.

It seems that command2 is not executed at all... If I execute it manually from the shell with www-data user, the command2 exectues and I get the output file -> not a permission problem. Is there something to configure to allow python to execute wine commands ? \n\nA: The syntax is generally correct but you need to give Wine a more explicit path to your executable. You can see what is going on in the return error:\n>>> subprocess.call(\"wine someexecutable.exe inputfile outpufile\", shell=True)\nwine: cannot find L\"C:\\\\windows\\\\system32\\\\someexecutable.exe\"\n\n\nA: The following code should work, as long as wine\nis installed properly:\nsubprocess.call(\"./filename.exe\", shell=True)\n\nI was able to get it to work without calling wine directly, hopefully the same works for you.\n\nA: Try this:\nimport commands\n\ncommand1 = 'dir > test.txt'\ncommand2 = 'wine someexecutable.exe inputfile outpufile'\n\ncmd1 = commands.getoutput(command1)\ncmd2 = commands.getoutput(command2)\n\nNote: sometimes OS pipe buffer might get filled with output being redirected to a pipe, thus try commands module instead of subprocess for this task!\n", "Q: How to get back lost capacity after using Gparted? I have a laptop with a single Intel 80GB SSD. I originaly only had W7, but installed Ubuntu on a small partition of this disk. Recently I wanted to expand the partition containing Ubuntu and so booted up from a USB to run Gparted from there. The idea was to resize the W7 partition and use this extra space for my Ubuntu partition. I had:\nWindows partition 61GB\nUbuntu partition 9,3GB\nLinux-Swap 4GB\n\nResizing the W7 partition using Gparted went fine, which gave me some unallocated disk space. I now needed to move this unallocated space next to my ubuntu partition. To do this I deleted the swap disk used by Ubuntu in order to expand the Ubuntu partition in to this area of the hard drive. Which means I had:\nWindows partition 56,17GB\nUnallocated 4,88GB\nUbuntu partition 9,3GB\nUnallocated 4GB\n\nI then used then used the unallocated space from the Windows partition as a new swap disk:\nWindows partition 56,17GB\nLinux-Swap 4,88GB\nUbuntu partition 9,3GB\nUnallocated 4GB\n\nAnd at last I wanted to extend my ubuntu partition to include the now unallocated space from the old swap. This is where I had trouble. \nI tried do resize the Ubuntu partition in Gparted, but got an error message that I did not save. The Ubuntu partition did grow however and according to Gparted I now have:\nWindows partition 56,17GB\nLinux-Swap 4,88GB\nUbuntu partition 13,5GB\n\nThe problem is that the additional 4GB in the Ubuntu partition don't show up, it is as if I gained 4GB, but that these 4GB are being used by some file.

This live image uses a newer version of resize2fs 1.42.8-1.\nThis newer version of GParted (0.16.2) will also indicate if there is unallocated space within the partition.\n\nA: Open gparted again and run a CHECK on the filesystem.  This will also expand it to use all of the available space.\n\nA: Your explanation is a rather hard to follow but when you are dealing with Windows it would have been better to resize the drive with Windows to avoid a lot of troubles. In windows you type this in Run >  diskmgmt.msc  and disk management will pop up. You would want to do all the resizing of windows there.  I definitely think you should run diskmgmt to see what it shows. Windows is able to move its own files when you resize a partition with diskmgmt but Linux will not. also you may well want to run Bleachbit on your Ubuntu install to clean out the junk files. You may be surprised on how much space you will regain if you haven't used it before. You can download Bleachbit from Ubuntu Software Manager.

The printer installs just great but print jobs only get held in the print queue.\nHow can I get it working? I use Ubuntu 13.10\n\nA: If anyone is still looking for this in Ubuntu 16.04 here is how I did it:\n\n\n*\n\n*Found a package with the text 'bjpnp' using:\napt-cache search bjnp\n\n\n*Installed the only package containing that text: cups-backend-bjnp\nsudo apt-get install cups-backend-bjnp\n\n\n*Went to Settings > Printers > Add Printer and expanded the Network printer section on the left.

When I ran the browser, I found an entry for Canon MX870 series_96F40AF11E06 under canon-bjnp1._tcp\nWhen I selected this entry I got the value of Address: 96F40A000000.local/192.168.0.114:8611\nNext I noticed that on ubuntu 15.04 I didn't have the bjnp protocol installed.  In the Ubuntu Software Center, I did a search for BJNP and found the \"Printer backend for Canon BJNP protocol\".  If you install that, when you go back to add the network printer, you get a new option called \"Canon Network Printer\". You'll notice it gives you the beginning of the url as bjnp, complete it to bjnp://96F40A000000.local\nThen continue to select the model of the printer from the list, and do a test print.  Seems to work fine.\nTo get the scanner functionality working, you can also edit /etc/sane.d/pixma.conf and add the same url in the bottom of the settings file.\nNote I chose to use the link local address instead of the IP address so if the DHCP server updates the ip, the configuration will still work.\n", "Q: What is the most appropriate way to get Nautilus 3.8 on Ubuntu 13.04?

It happens every time, but Ubuntu uses the swap, when I start some vm's.\n\nA: I have just started with Ubuntu so perhaps someone more knowledgeable can shed some more light on the issue; however, I was getting the same error message and in my case at least, it seemed to be related to the encryption of the swap partition. \nIt seems that when you choose the \"encrypt home directory\" option during the install, this also encrypts your swap partition. I am guessing that because your swap partition is encrypted it is not seen during the boot sequence and the \"... --vg-swap_1 is not ready or not present\" message appears.\nI re-installed and chose not to \"encrypt the home directory\" which seems to prevent the \"... --vg-swap_1 is not ready or not present\" message from showing.

That said, with OpenOffice and\n  Firefox having been there from the start, Gtk is clearly not an\n  absolute requirement. What I’m arguing now is that it’s the values\n  which are important, and the toolkit is only a means to that end.

After searching answers on here I got past the Broadcom wireless card/no connectivity issue and the missing splash screens/nvidia proprietary drivers issue, but this one has me beat.\nMy wireless router is broadcasting its SSID correctly - it is definitely not hidden. The router is set to broadcast the SSID and other devices pick it up fine. However on boot Ubuntu shows no available networks for connection. After poking around I managed to set up a connection manually via 'Connect to hidden wireless network'. This works fine until a reboot, at which point I have to reconnect manually (the connection I set up remains in the drop-down list). If I disconnect without rebooting, the network remains listed under wireless networks and I can reconnect with a single click. I've tried changing all available wireless switches (wifi catcher etc) in the bios and all combinations of the 'Connect automatically' and 'Available to all users' tickboxes in the 'Edit connections' dialogue, but no result.\nThis is more a convenience thing than a deal breaker but any suggestions would be gratefully received.\n\nA: I was also having this problem with 12.04.

First I execute it from Eclipse.  After that from the terminal window I view the list of my processes. Now I execute that program from command line and view the list of processes. \nI see the process is listed with different states: when the program is executed from Eclipse the state is S, when the program is executed from the terminal, the state is S+.\nWhat is the reason?\n\nA: When you run the process in a terminal, its process state is marked with a + because it is the foreground process in that terminal. This means, among other things, that the terminal can be used to control the process. For instance, pressing Ctrl-C will result in an SIGINT signal being sent to the process. Depending on the signal handlers in the program, this will usually terminate the process. Also, closing the terminal will send a a SIGHUP* signal to the process.\nWhen you run the process from Eclipse, the + is not there because the process is not in the foreground process group of any terminal. In fact, unless you have started Eclipse from a terminal (and not backgrounded it with & or ^Z), Eclipse itself will not have a controlling terminal, and so will none of its child processes.\n\n*) HUP for \"hang up\", from the days when terminals were physical machines that connected to computers over serial dial-up lines\n", "Q: Newbie - Downloads slow on wireless, long time to connect to wireless its taking a long time to connect to the wireless, and when it does, the internet in general seems unstable and really slow, like 45 mins to download a 50MB file on a 30MB connection.

There is also nothing in the Ubuntu Display control panel for the monitors.  \n\nA: It's possible that some of the ports (i.e. the dvi ports) are connected directly to the nvidia graphics card rather than the integrated intel card that runs the thinkpad display. This was the case with my W530 - see my blog post here: http://zachstechnotes.blogspot.com/2012/01/tri-head-display-on-linux-thinkpad-w520.html\nThe primary function of Bumblebee is to render graphics on the nvidia card and send that image to the intel card to show on your thinkpad display.

Thanks,my system is ubuntu13.04, 64-bit. \n\nA: The current version of plymouth in raring/main is 0.8.8-0ubuntu6.2, whereas in your cached APT lists it is 0.8.8-0ubuntu6. There is a small possibility that this is caused by a lagging mirror, in which case it will fix itself within a day.\nHowever, it won't harm to force APT to obtain the latest package lists. Remove the cached APT lists from your system and run apt-get update to refresh them:\nsudo rm -rf /var/lib/apt/lists/*\nsudo apt-get update\n\nBefore you do this, please note that you are using both the 12.04 (precise) and 13.04 (raring) archives. Unless you have a specific reason for doing so, I'd suggest removing the 12.04 package sources. Also, you seem to be using PPA's. Disable any that you don't need anymore, as these may also disturb the dependency management.\n\nA: Running\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get dist-upgrade\n\nshould upgrade the kept back package.\n", "Q: How can I install the latest version of GROMACS? The version of GROMACS available in the Ubuntu Software Center? is not the latest available version. \nHow can I install the latest version of GROMACS without using the Ubuntu Software Center?\n\nA: Instead of waiting, you can download the latest Gromacs, and install it.  Once downloaded, make sure that you have all the prerequisites met, and just press Ctrl+Alt+T on your keyboard to open Terminal. When it opens, navigate to where the file was downloaded (probably the Downloads folder), run the command(s) below:\ntar xfz gromacs-4.6.1.tar.gz\ncd gromacs-4.6.1\nmkdir build\ncd build\ncmake .. -DGMX_BUILD_OWN_FFTW=ON\nmake\nsudo make install\n\nFor more detailed info, and how to meet the prerequisites, see the Installation Instructions\n", "Q: Eagle CAD - GTK look I am an Archlinux (former Ubuntu) user and am writing here to ask how is the GTK (adwaita) look for application \"Eagle CAD\" achieved in Gnome Ubuntu remix or in normal Ubuntu. I can't seem to find any topic on how to do it on any of the distributions...\n\nA: You should first find in what languages eaglecad is made of.\nIt's made in C++ and QT. (SourceForge page)\nSo to sum up you try to apply a GTK theme to a QT User Interface.\nHere is how to achieve this : How can I theme my Qt app to resemble one written in Gtk?\n", "Q: log4cxx/logger.h or libcql/cql.hpp fatal error while doing make -j4 I am running make -j4 and I am getting below exception...\nuserName@phx5qa01c-4e23:~/build$ make -j4\n[  1%] [  2%] Building CXX object nda/common/loadtest/CMakeFiles/loadtester.dir/LoadTester.cc.o\nmake[2]: *** No rule to make target `/usr/include/libcql/lib/libcql.so', needed by `nda/common/client/client'.

I've been looking everywhere for Unity Tweak Tool in Ubuntu 12.04 Precise but I can't seem to find it so could anyone help?\n\nA: Unity Tweak Tool (unity-tweak-tool) can be installed from the default Ubuntu repositories in Ubuntu 13.04 and later, but it is not available in the Ubuntu Software Center for Ubuntu 12.04. The application that is most similar to Unity Tweak Tool in the Ubuntu Software Center in Ubuntu 12.04 is MyUnity.\nMyUnity allows one to configure and tune Unity with a pleasant and comfortable graphical interface.

Did you mean, you want to show up a shared drive from Ubuntu? For that you would need to use Samba.\nUbuntu has a guide on how to setup Samba here.\n", "Q: Why can't I connect to this service when launched via Upstart? I have a web service written in Golang that I need to fire up using Upstart.\nI can run the service executable (named word) on port 5555 from within it's directory manually like so:\nPORT=5555 ./word\n\nThen curl -i http://127.0.0.1:5555/api/word returns the correct response (which is some JSON).\nNow, I need to run this service via Upstart. I've written this script (called word.conf):\nstart on runlevel [2345]\nstop on runlevel [!2345]\n\nchdir /home/word\n\nsetgid word\nsetuid word\n\nexport PORT=5555\nexec ./word\n\nI run it via sudo start word\nstatus word then tells me that the service is running and I see no errors in the Upstart error logs.\nWhen trying to hit the service again via curl -i http://127.0.0.1:5555/api/word I get a curl: (7) couldn't connect to host error.\nThis seems like it has to be some sort of permissions issue, but I can't pinpoint it.\nI tried removing the setgid and setuid and running with no luck. I do have a user called word.\nI'm on Ubuntu 12.04.3.\nAny ideas?\n\nA: If that's your complete script, then it has a two simple problems. exec should be in a script [...] end script like this:\nscript\n    exec ./word\nend script\n\nand the export variable should be declared first with a env stanza:\nenv PORT=5555\nexport PORT\n\nSo the whole script should looks like:\nstart on runlevel [2345]\nstop on runlevel [!2345]\n\nchdir /home/word\n\nsetgid word\nsetuid word\n\nenv PORT=5555\nexport PORT\n\nscript\n    exec ./word\nend script\n\nI would also instead of calling ./word would call the interpreter first. If it's a bash script:\nexec /usr/bin/env bash ./word\n\npython:\nexec /usr/bin/env python word\n\nReferences:\n\n\n*\n\n*http://upstart.ubuntu.com/cookbook/#env\n\n*http://upstart.ubuntu.com/cookbook/#export\n\n*http://upstart.ubuntu.com/cookbook/#script\n\nA: You need to define your environment variable using env, and specify the interpreter to call your script:\nstart on runlevel [2345]\nstop on runlevel [!2345]\n\nchdir /home/word\n\nsetgid word\nsetuid word\n\nenv PORT=5555\nexport PORT\n\nexec go run word\n\nYou may not need to 'export PORT' if this is the only process that uses it, and if the interpreter is defined in the script then you may not even need to include it in the exec.\n", "Q: Can Ubuntu provide an IDE for C, C++ programming? I am a beginner in the field of programming. I have tried to learn C and C++ on a Windows 7 computer using the Turbo C++ compiler, but faced frequent failures and finally my laptop's motherboard failed. Please guide me so that can I install Ubuntu on my Windows 7 computer. Can Ubuntu provide a built-in IDE for C, C++ programming, and if not, what is the solution for my problem on Ubuntu?\n\nA: Edit:\nIn addition to my answer below, I'd like to add point out that the Netbeans C++ edition is a very nice IDE too. At the time when I wrote my answer, I haven't considered looking at this because I only knew it from Java development, and for this I use Jetbrains IDEA. A bit later I tried Netbeans for a C++ project and it turned out to be very helpful and intuitive.\n\nFor the first part of your question about installing on a Win7 machine, please read on the official ubuntu. It is explained how you can create a dual system with Windows and Ubuntu.\nFor your second question: Yes, Ubuntu and Linux in general is excellent for C/C++ development. You have several choices if you want an IDE instead of a simple editor. I personally like Eclipse with C++ support, but you have several other choices\n\n*\n\n*Code::Blocks is a very nice C++ IDE\n\n*Qt Creator which can be used for development in general and not only for Qt applications\n\n*Anjuta is another one I tried long time ago which was quite nice..\n\nPlease find a long list of available IDE's here (although it's in German, you surly can read this).\nPlease note that especially Eclipse, Code::Blocks and QT Creator is not restricted to Ubuntu. You can try them in Windows too!\n", "Q: Need \"correct\" method to install nvidia driver on thinkpad running ubuntu 12.04+ Yes, I have read How do I install the Nvidia drivers?\n and yes, I have looked for years and experimented extensively with directions from many dozens of pages.\nMy question here on askubuntu yesterday was removed as already answered in error.\nPlease do not remove it again, as it is not answered.\nGOAL: GLX working on any nvidia driver with at least a 1920 x 1080 X window display size.\nSTARTING WITH:\n\n\n*\n\n*Lenovo Thinkpad W520\n\n*ubuntu 12.04 LTS 64 bit\n\n*http://us.download.nvidia.com/XFree86/Linux-x86/319.23/README/installdriver.html\n\n*http://us.download.nvidia.com/XFree86/Linux-x86_64/295.53/NVIDIA-Linux-x86_64-295.53.run\n\n*working X on 1920 x 1080 (16:9) laptop display (no nvidia or GLX)\n\n\nACTIONS:\nCTRL-ALT-F1\nlogin:passwd\ncd Downloads\nsudo su\nservice lightdm stop\ninit 3\npushd /etc\nmkdir X11.backup; cd X11; tar cf - .|(cd ../X11.backup;tar xf -) # Make a safe copy\npopd\nchmod +x NVIDIA.*run\n./NVIDIA.*run\nservice lightdm start\n\nPROBLEM 1: X screen is 640x480 with no possibility of adjustment (System Settings>Displays) offers no size changes.

Now I want to use ack-grep 2.+. \nOfficial documentation says that I can install ack-grep 2.0 with apt-get, but when I try to install, it says it's already the newest version.\nI also tried install it with a specified version like:\nsudo apt-get install ack-grep 2.10\n\nIt installs something, but ack-grep is still 1.92.\nHow can I install the newest version?\n\nA: You can't install yet ack-grep 2.10 using apt-get because ack-grep 2.10 is not yet included in Ubuntu repositories. To see what versions are available in repositories, you can use the following command:\napt-cache showpkg ack-grep\n\nBut you can install by downloading it from here:\n\n\n*\n\n*http://packages.debian.org/sid/ack-grep\nIt's a deb file, so you can be interested also by:\n\n\n*\n\n*How do I install a .deb file via the command line?\n\nA: If you are using Ubuntu 13.10, then you can install ack-grep 2.04.2 using the Ubuntu Software Center. The ack-grep package is from the universe repository. ack-grep is a meta package to pull ack in 18.04 and later. Run sudo apt install ack and execute ack instead of ack-grep.\nTo give an example of what ack-grep can do, here is a command to display eight lines from somewhere in the middle of the bash manual, which is larger than 300Kb, and therefore it is inconvenient to find a referenced line number in the bash manual by scrolling down in the terminal, but it's easy to do with ack-grep:\nman bash | ack-grep . --lines=4581-4588\n\n...gives the following block of text from the bash manual as output:\npwd [-LP]\n       Print the absolute pathname of the current working directory.\n       The pathname printed contains no symbolic links if the -P option\n       is supplied or the -o physical option to the set builtin command\n       is enabled. If the -L option is used, the pathname printed may\n       contain symbolic links. The return status is 0 unless an error\n       occurs while reading the name of the current directory or an\n       invalid option is supplied.\n\nThe command that is equivalent to the above command in 18.04 and later uses ack instead of ack-grep and different line numbers because the bash manual is longer in 18.04. ack works the same as ack-grep and outputs the same results: \nman bash | ack . --lines=4970-4977\n\n\nA: You don't have to wait for saucy (Ubuntu 13.10) to be released to use its version of ack-grep. You can install just one package, and its unmet dependencies, from a future release with the right apt-pinning preferences. \nSee these examples: \nInstall packages from newer release without building (apt pinning)\nInstall a single specific package from future distribution\n\nA: An ack2 PPA for Precise 12.04 has been created by Leonard Ehrenfried here:\nhttp://leonard.io/blog/2013/10/ack2-package-for-ubuntu-1204-precise/\nhttps://launchpad.net/~leonard-ehrenfried/+archive/ack2\nFor those like me on Quantal 12.10, the PPA can still be used once added by replacing \"quantal\" with \"precise\" in /etc/apt/sources.list.d/leonard-ehrenfried-ack2-quantal.list \n", "Q: How to change icon size?

I don't understand why it remembers mine, but not his.\n\nA: A keyring is never used to save a password (From Facebook or otherwise).\nThe Gnome or KDE keyrings are used to safely keep decrypted keys (hence the name) and no passwords.\nOne solution for you is to make use of two browsers. For example you could install Firefox and Seamonkey (because Seamonkey is very similar to Firefox.) You can also install Opera, Chrome, Konqueror...\nThe other is to check your existing browser and look to see whether someone clicked on \"do not remember password\" for that domain. If that's the case, then the browser stops asking you if you want to save the password. Once you have 2 or more passwords and you go to the login screen, it will no fill out anything until you start typing your email address (or other login credential, some websites ask for a username which increases security!)\nWith Firefox you can manage your passwords under:\nEdit » Preferences ...\n\nSecurity » Remember password for sites » Exceptions ...\n\nYou should see an entry for Facebook in that popup. If so, select it and remove it and then have your dad try again.\nNote that by clearing all your history and other data, Firefox resets that scheme and it should ask you for your passwords again and give you the option to save them.

How can I do it?\n\nA: The solution is to set 'pipefail' option before running the command.\nhttp://www.gnu.org/software/bash/manual/bashref.html\n\nIf pipefail is enabled, the pipeline's return status is the value of\n  the last (rightmost) command to exit with a non-zero status, or zero\n  if all commands exit successfully.\n\nSo now my script looks like the following:\nset -o pipefail\ncd SomeDir && (sh -c \"$CMD_STR\") 2>&1 | some_filtering | sed -u -e ....\nexit $?\n\n\nA: To check last exit status code in bash shell, you can use:\necho $?\n\nAlso you said that you use that command in a script, so, to retrieve status code, you can run that script as follow:\nsh -x /path/to/script\n\nor\nbash -x /path/to/script\n\nOther options are to use set -x and set +x commands in the script to retrieve status code for parts of the script.\nMore about:\n\n\n*\n\n*Debugging Bash scripts.\n\n", "Q: Thunderbird won't send email Out of sudden, my Thunderbird stopped sending e-mails.

I want to mount it transparently to these server.\nsudo mount ServerIP:/folder/already/setup/to/be/shared/home/username/folder/in/your/local\nCan someone please tell me some mechanism that we can mount same directory of NFS client to multiple NFS Servers. SO that i can store the file 8TB in size. \n\nA: Overview:\nLet’s say we have three disks but you wish to share with NFS clients and may be such situation when you want to mount multiple drives to single drive,..\nSolution:\nOf course we can mount the disks on three separate mount points and export those. Or we can mount the three disks on three mount points inside the same directory and export the parent directory. \nThe problem with both solutions is you have to “balance” the data among the disks - and it will make navigating your TViX, WDTV or Popcorn more annoying. You could use RAID or LVM to handle all this for you. But. What if you already have data on the disks? What happens if one of the disks dies? With RAID0 or LVM your data is gone.\nLuckily we have the best of both worlds: mhddfs\nmhddfs is a FUSE plugin that combines data from several directories and present it in one directory. The only downside is that you do not know (or control) where a file is created. \nLet’s say you combine /dir1, /dir2 and /dir3 under /virtual. Previously you had /dir1/my_content. This is now /virtual/my_content. If you write a file to /virtual/my_content it will not necessarily end up in /dir1/my_content. This also mean you can not predict what data is lost if you lose a disk.\nThe plugin is available in Ubuntu\n$ sudo apt-get install mhddfs\n\nUsing it is pretty simple\n$ sudo mkdir /export/hest\n$ sudo mhddfs /dir1,dir2,dir3 /export/hest\n[sudo] password for alj: \nmhddfs: directory '/dir1' added to list\nmhddfs: directory '/dir2' added to list\nmhddfs: directory '/dir3' added to list\nmhddfs: mount to: /export/hest\nmhddfs: move size limit 4294967296 bytes\n\nThe “move size limit” deserves an explanation:\nif free space size threshold if a drive has the free space less than the    threshold specified then another drive will be chosen while creating a new file.

I'm using three languages, and while typing in Gmail or somewhere, we look at the text cursor. So for convenience reasons it would be a nice way to adapt separate color (or text cursor form) for each language.\nI don't know if this is already implemented. Would be nice to use this feature. Would appreciate if you can point me in right direction.\nAs I said, this is not about mouse cursor/pointer, this is about the cursor in text fields.\n\nA: Make a shell script that tests weather how your language ($LANG) is set. Then, it output a value of a colored prompt accordingly.  \nIn .bashrc, you would then set the promptvars shell option, and then set the bash prompt to the output of that shell script, like this:  \nPS1=\"`/full/path/your-script.sh`\\$ \"\n\nThat way, your script will be invoked each and every time you get a command prompt and it will generate the corresponding prompt string according to how LANG is set.  \nHow do you generate a colored prompt? It will imposible for me to describe it without transcribing a color table... However, the easy way is to go to http://ezprompt.net/ and have it generate it for you on either case, and then just copy the generated colorized prompts on each particular case.\n", "Q: arecord generating blank files I am trying to record something using the utility arecord but I am unable to do so.\nThe command generates an audio file but when I play it, it is blank.\nThe operating system Information:\nLinux Network 3.2.0-54-generic #82-Ubuntu SMP Tue Sep 10 20:08:42 UTC 2013 x86_64 \nx86_64 x86_64 GNU/Linux\nDistributor ID: Ubuntu\nDescription:    Ubuntu 12.04.3 LTS\nRelease:        12.04\nCodename:       precise\n\nThe output of arecord -l:\n**** List of CAPTURE Hardware Devices ****\ncard 0: Intel [HDA Intel], device 0: ALC662 rev1 Analog [ALC662 rev1 Analog]\n  Subdevices: 1/1\n  Subdevice #0: subdevice #0\ncard 0: Intel [HDA Intel], device 2: ALC662 rev1 Analog [ALC662 rev1 Analog]\n  Subdevices: 1/1\n  Subdevice #0: subdevice #0\n\nThe Screenshot of alsamixer I am linking:\n\nI am on this since yesterday and have not found any solution.

I've been following the steps as I did on my other computer and get this error when selection the option: \"Something else\".\nI've selected the partition and clicked continue and got this error:\n\nWhat does this message mean and if I keep going what would happen to my computer. Any help would be awesome.\n\nA: You should do what it says; Go Back & check your installation settings. Have you allocated enough swap space for the install?\n\nA: Disclaimer: I am in no way an expert and anything you see below was figured out by my own trial and error. This answer isn't necessarily the most correct answer, but it is what worked. Also, make sure to read the whole thing through before attempting any of it.\nBefore following the instructions below, please install rEFIt or rEFInd1.\nIn order to fix this issue I needed to create an extra partition. Follow the steps below. The first one should be done in OSX's Disk Utility and the rest inside GParted after selecting \"Try Ubuntu.\"\n\n\n*\n\n*Make sure to have already resized your \"Macintosh HD\" partition so that you have room for the new partitions (~50 GiB is what I chose). Note: This is the only step you should be doing in an OSX-native program like Disk Utility and not within Ubuntu.\n\n*Create a new partition called \"booatloader\" with file system ReiserFS. I made this partition 500 MiB. (I'm not exactly sure if the file system or size matters)\n\n*Create a new linux-swap partition that's about 1 GiB. I called this one \"swap\".\n\n*Create an ext4 partition called \"primary\" using the rest of your unallocated space.\n\n\nAfter following the instructions above, GParted should look similar to the following image. Keep in mind that I took this after installation. The labels for my linux-swap and ext4 partitions disappeared and the key/exclamation icons were added after installation by Ubuntu. Also, no need to set a bios_grub flag for the ResiserFS partition, this was also automatically added post- (or during-) installation.\n\nNow that the partitions are set up, go back to the desktop, click on \"Install Ubuntu 12.04\" (this should also appear in the menubar on the left if it's not on the desktop), and follow along below\n\n\n*\n\n*Go through the options (personalizing them however you like) until you get to the \"Installation type\" screen that asks you how you want to install Ubuntu.\n\n*On the \"Installation type\" screen, select \"Something else\" and continue (press \"Install Now\").\n\n*You'll now arrive at a window that lists all the partitions you have. Identify the \"bootloader\" partition (if the labels don't show, identify it by the device, type, or size columns) and double click on it.\n\n*A window that says \"Edit partition\" should popup. Select the option field next to \"Use as:\" and click on the value that says \"Reserved BIOS boot area\" (figure below). Press \"OK.\"\n\n\n*Identify the ext4 partition you just created and bring up the \"Edit partition\" window.\n\n*Set the \"Use as:\" value to \"Ext4 journaling file system,\" check the format option. Make sure to also set the mount field to /. Press \"OK.\"\n\n*Go ahead and continue the process, personalizing the results as you desire.\n\n\nFrom here, everything should work fine. Make sure to have rEFIt or rEFInd installed so that you can boot into Ubuntu later1.\n\n1. It turns out that if you get stuck while booting, instead of using a program like rEFIt and it's predecessor, you can just hold the alt+option key to boot into a partition/disk/whatever.\n\nSource: this answer by jeremy.\n\nA: The SWAP should be as large as your RAM in a desktop system, to prevent system freezes and avoid uncommon and \"uncomfortable\" configurations.\nYou should also leave a small space for the \"BIOS\" boot area of 2 mb: don't worry you are not loosing space, because there is always some free space on the HD after any OS installation.\nIf you create many partitions for Linux, the system will be more stable and a bit faster; there are also many technical advantages for the maintenance.\nOnly remember that the system grows with the time and needs space (it's normal), so make a large root partition if you need lots of software.\nHappy tweaking.\n\nA: I recommend you do not use the \"Something Else\" option, and use the default option that says \"Install Ubuntu Alongside your Existing OS\". This option automatically allocates the required swap memory according to the specs of your machine, and it usually avoids most fatal installation errors\n\nA: I have been going through this same problem for the past 3 days.

You can also only have 4 sda's active at one time. If not you will have to create a new partition table and erase Windows.\nUbuntu versions higher then 12.04 LTS seem to have a lot of installing problems from what I have seen.

Version 4 even (ext4).\n\nWill it be possible the files (which come from the old file system) to be read by the new file system? \n\nYes, if they are documents that is. 2 examples: LibreOffices Writer handles most of the files you can create with Word. LibreOffice Calc can handle Excel files. Plain text will never be a problem. But for a complete answer you need to tell us what files you have ;)\n\nAlso, what kind of obstacles I should have in mind when trying to do that?\n\nYou do need to pay attention to macro's.

Now I have an UEFI server, and the compatibility (BIOS) mode does not seem to work.\nSo I went the way of installing with UEFI.\nFirst test, single drive installation works fine.\nThen I tried to install with RAID1 + LVM.\nI partionned my two drives the same way:\n\n\n*\n\n*an EFI system partition, 200MB\n\n*a physical RAID partition\n\n\nThen I did setup:\n - a RAID 1 using both disks RAID partitions\n - a LVM volume group on the RAID 1 array\n - three logical volumes: /, /home and swap\nThe installation went on, but on reboot, I get a grub shell and I am stuck.\nSo, is it possible to have grub2-efi work on LVM over RAID1 ? What is the way to achieve this ? Are there other bootloader alternatives (direct linux loading from EFI ??) ? etc...\n\nA: I did this a little over a year ago myself, and, while I did have problems, didn't have the problems listed here.  I'm not sure where I found the advice I did at the time, so I'll post what I did here.\n1) Create 128MB efi partitions at the start (only one of which will mount, at /boot/efi)\n2) Create 1 GB /boot RAID1 array, no LVM\n3) Create large RAID1 array using LVM\nHaving /boot be on a separate partition/RAID1 array solves the issues of the efi partition being unable to find the appropriate things.\nAnd for those looking for more detail, as I was at the time, this is, more precisely, how I have done my setup:\n6x 3TB Drives\n\nHave 4 RAID arrays:\n/dev/md0 = 1GB RAID1 across 3 drives\n   --> /boot (no LVM)\n/dev/md1 = 500GB RAID1 across 3 drives\n   LVM:\n      --> /     =  40GB\n      --> /var  = 100GB\n      --> /home = 335GB\n      --> /tmp  =  10GB\n\n/dev/md2 = 500GB RAID1 across 3 drives (for VM's/linux containers)\n   LVM:\n      --> /lxc/container1 =  50GB\n      --> /lxc/container2 =  50GB\n      --> /lxc/container3 =  50GB\n      --> /lxc/container4 =  50GB\n      --> /lxc/extra      = 300GB (for more LXC's later)\n\n/dev/md3 = 10TB RAID6 across 6 drives (for media and such)\n   --> /mnt/raid6 (no LVM)\n\n\nDisks are setup thus:\n\n/sda => /boot/efi (128 MB) | /dev/md0 (1 GB) | /dev/md1 (500GB) | /dev/md3 (2.5TB)\n/sdb => /boot/efi (128 MB) | /dev/md0 (1 GB) | /dev/md1 (500GB) | /dev/md3 (2.5TB)\n/sdc => /boot/efi (128 MB) | /dev/md0 (1 GB) | /dev/md1 (500GB) | /dev/md3 (2.5TB)\n/sdd => ----- left empty for simplicity ---- | /dev/md2 (500GB) | /dev/md3 (2.5TB)\n/sde => ----- left empty for simplicity ---- | /dev/md2 (500GB) | /dev/md3 (2.5TB)\n/sdf => ----- left empty for simplicity ---- | /dev/md2 (500GB) | /dev/md3 (2.5TB)\n\nNote only one of the /boot/efi will actually mount, and the second two are clones; I did this because I waned to be able to have the machine still boot when losing any one of the 3 disks in the RAID1.  I don't mind running in degraded mode if I still have full redundancy, and that gives me time to replace the drive while the machine still is up.\nAlso, if I did not have the second RAID1 array for putting the LXC containers and basically all the databases and such, /var would have to have been MUCH bigger.  Having each LXC as its own logical volume was, however, a nice solution to prevent one VM/website from disrupting the others due to out-of-control error logs, for example...\nAnd final note, I installed from the Ubuntu Alternate Install USB with 12.04.01 (before 12.04.02 came out), and everything worked quite nicely.

And it will be able to boot even if one of the two disks fails.\n2) How to do this ?\nThe're seem to be a bug in the installer, so just using the installer results in a failure to boot (grub shell).\nHere is a working procedure:\n1) manually create the following partitions on each of the two disks:\n- a 512MB partition with type UEFI a the beginning of the disk\n- a partition of type RAID after that\n2) create your RAID 1 array with the two RAID partitions, then create your LVM volume group with that array, and your logical volumes (I created one for root, one for home and one for swap).\n3) let the install go on, and reboot. FAILURE ! You should get a grub shell.\n4) it might be possible to boot from the grub shell, but I choosed to boot from a rescue usb disk. In rescue mode, I opened a shell on my target root fs (that is the one on the root lvm logical volume).\n5) get the UUID of this target root partition with 'blkid'. Note it down or take picture with your phone, you'll need it next step.\n6) mount the EFI system partition ('mount /boot/efi') and edit the grub.cfg file: vi /boot/efi/EFI/ubuntu/grub.cfg\nHere, replace the erroneous UUID with the one you got at point 5.\nSave.\n7) to be able to boot from the second disk, copy the EFI partition to this second disk:\ndd if=/dev/sda1 of=/dev/sdb1 (change sda or sdb with whatever suits your configuration).\n8) Reboot. In your UEFI setting screen, set the two EFI partitions as bootable, and set a boot order.\nYou're done. You can test, unplug one or the other of the disks, it should work !\n", "Q: How to run Ubuntu touch apps on Ubuntu desktop?

The application doesn't allow simultaneous editing and locks the spreadsheet to read-only mode after it has been opened by the first user. The solution depends on the application you use. For example, Excel has limited sharing capabilities which can be found in Tools -> Share Workbook.... More information on Excel sharing can be found on the Office site.

Your desktop file tells you this:\nExec=gksudo python /opt/lampp/share/xampp-control-panel/xampp-control-panel.py\n\nSo you can do ...\ngksudo python /opt/lampp/share/xampp-control-panel/xampp-control-panel.py\n\non command line and get it to activate. \nBesides that: if you start the xampp control panel it will also add an icon to the Unity Launcher.

I would like to know if there is a standard folder where I should install java, eclipse and any other tar.gz files that are intended for unpacking and then compiling generally?\n\nA: In general you do -not- install software using tar.gz files. These files are containers that hold software (that might contain software to install but normally you get is all done and ready for you to use). You use either Ubuntu software center or debian installer files to install software.\n\n*\n\n*Eclipse: https://askubuntu.com/a/118377/15811\n\n*Java: https://launchpad.net/~webupd8team/+archive/java\nSo there should not be a need to use tar files for these 2 pieces of software.\nBut if you still want to continue with this: for these types of installations the advised location to extract tar.gz files is /opt/.

The problem is that the sensor hub sensor drivers don't expose a raw interface, so you have to use the buffered interface, which is not easy to set up.  To add to that, the drivers may not correctly initalize some sensors so that they hang.\nThere is a program called generic_buffer alluded to in the presentation mentioned above.  However, there are many problems with that program, at least the most readily available versions.\nI have a fixed up version of generic_buffer in https://github.com/pfps/yoga-laptop under sensors.  I also have a program that monitors the accelerometer and rotates the screen accordingly.   Feel free to use and abuse them, and, if you can, please improve them.\n\nA: quick google, I found this: https://archive.fosdem.org/2012/schedule/event/693/127_iio-a-new-subsystem.pdf\npages 22-24: Userspace API, has some shell commands accessing the device files in /sys.\nIn the linux kernel tree, \"Documentation/ABI/testing/sysfs-bus-iio\" has some info as well.\nI'm not an expert, but maybe that could help get you some of the way?\n", "Q: How do I partition a hard drive when Ubuntu is already installed?

I downloaded it from a download-portal (it was gimpshop_26953.deb from netzwelt.de) and installed via Ubuntu Software Center. The Software Center claimed that the package was of bad quality because the maintainer-mail-adress was missing. I installed anyway (probably a bad idea, lesson learned).\nAnyway: How can I get rid of what I installed? It does not show as installed in Ubuntu Software Center, neither can I manage to find anything that makes sense with aptitude (searching for 'gimp').\nSoftware Center told me after the successful installation that \"the following applications are run from Terminal: gimp, gimp-2.2, gimp-remote, gimp-2.2-remote, gimptools\". Running 'gimp' from Terminal resulted in starting vanilla GIMP 2.2 (which was not the point in installing GimpShop at all). So I now just want to get rid of it and install 2.8 straight away. Problem: It does not start. No error given. I think the old installation is still messing around.\nPlease please advise how to learn what this pesky *.deb installed and how to uninstall it. I can provide you with the *.deb/link if needed.\n\nA: You can also use\nsudo apt-get purge gimpshop\n\nwhich will remove package with its config files. Sometimes you want to get rid of everything that the package brought and AFAIK this is your case.\nIn the next versions of Ubuntu, when btrfs filesystem will be default, apt-get is integrated with snapshots of btrfs so you can get exactly to the state before the package was installed.\n\nA: I was simply being stupid and not trying the obvious. Of course gimpshop somehow showed nowhere as installed (especially not in aptitude, searching in \"Installed packets\" for \"gimp\"), making it no easier.\nYet the obvious thing that I did not try, was\nsudo apt-get remove gimpshop\n\nIt did work. I installed GIMP 2.8 from the Software Center afterwards and it launched normal. Why it didn't before, I don't know.\nSo for future reference: ALWAYS try to apt-get remove the package you installed, no matter which way and how ominous the content seems at first.

But when I saw it in Thunderbird it was not shown correctly. It was like kind of encoded.\nSo, I'm keeping this question open until I dont find the right solution for now. \n\nA: When sending mail, even from the command line, it is best to use a program which was designed for that purpose, rather than calling sendmail directly. A good all-around command-line e-mail client is mutt; in particular it has a command-line flag to attach files, which avoids the cumbersome use of uuencode:\necho Test | mutt -s Test -a image.jpg -- firas@fkraiem.org\n\nAs usual, see man mutt for usage information.\n\nA: After searching through numerous useless MAN pages and googling I finally came to this solution:\nFile to be sent: test.csv\nOn Ubuntu you will have uuencode (AIX), provided by the package sharutils, which you may need to install (the equivalent on Redhat is mutt).\nuuencode test.csv test.csv | mail -v -s \"Subject test\" -r no-reply@mydomain.co.uk recepient@mydomain.co.uk\n\nThe biggest problem was to combine sendmail and attachment and at the same time setting the subject. Also on AIX I do not have the -a attachment option, like the LINUX Man page suggests. \nYou can also use mailx instead of mail with exactly the same parameters.\n", "Q: Mounting Network Files I am using Ubuntu 12.04 LTS and a NAS (QNAP TS-219P+) (IP adress: 192.168.0.111) on which SAMBA is running.\nI wanted to mount some files of the NAS using mounting points in /media. So I created for each NAS file a corresponding file in /media for example connecting NAS/transfer to /media transfer using chown and chmod. In fstab I added the necessary line, for example: \n//192.168.0.111/transfer /media/transfer cifs user=juergen,passwd=1234 0 0 \n\nand so on\nIn Nautilus the NAS file is initially shown as mounted in 'Geräte' (german). In English I think it would be 'Devices'. After a short while the mounted file appears in 'Rechner' (in German language). In English I think it should be 'Computer'.\nI can access the NAS files. But I am not able to change the owner and the user of for example /media/transfer from root root to juergen juergen. Using the command sudo chown -c juergen /media/transfer in the terminal line it is said that root root has changed to juergen juergen but using the command ls -l again root is shown as the owner.\nComment: I am using Ubuntu only for some months.\n\nA: You are trying to change ownership of a mountpoint; I don't know if that's possible, but neither I see the use of that.\nI guess what you want to achieve is to be able to access R/W the files on the remote drive as juergen, not only as root. In that case, add the uid option to your fstab line:\n//192.168.0.111/transfer /media/transfer cifs user=juergen,passwd=1234,uid=juergen 0 0\n\n", "Q: What does \"Output has been suspended by pressing Ctrl+S\" mean? I have encountered this for the first time in Ubuntu 13.10.\nWhat is the meaning of this message across the top of the terminal? Is it a warning or a suggestion? \n\nUnless I press Ctrl+Q, it doesn't give me a prompt to enter.\n\nA: In a standard \"shell\" the CTRL+S and CTRL+Q sequences are used to pause output to the screen.  By pressing CTRL+S the output is paused, and CTRL+Q re-enables output.\nIt was very useful in the days of standard ASCII terminals / green screens which didn't have a nice scroll bar on the edge of the window :)\n\nA: It's a common feature to stop unwanted output (in some cases it might be very useful). You can often have the same effect with the Pause/Interr command on the keyboard.Press CTRL+Q to resume the normal output/input and don't worry, it's normal. Good working...\n\nA: When one processes Ctrl+S, it suspends the screen from drawing. In this case, the screen will appear to be frozen.\nThis warning message is there just in case you did this by accident. This happens more often than you might think and it's can be very inconvenient because without knowing what happened you'll simply think that the terminal window has frozen and decide to close it.\n", "Q: what to do with ExecutablePath/usr/lib/nux/unity_support_test?

But, I have one microphone, stereo reproductors and headphones. In windows Realtek driver, I could simple change the audio input to output, now I'm using Ubuntu. Is there any option to change the input to output and conversely? Thanks\n\nA: I change the output between a audio jack device and a USB device using the \"Audio\" Program in Ubuntu. It's the same as clicking on the top right audio icon and choosing th last option (audio settings). There is an input tab, which lists my devices and I can easily change the active one. \nSince I'm not sure about your setup, but this may help you or someone with a similar problem.

Can this be done? if so, how?\n\nA: What worked for me was https://askubuntu.com/users/124963/saurav-kumar answer\n\nRun this command: exo-preferred-applications and go to Utilities tab\n  and in File Manager selection list chose your preferred file manager.\n  You would get Nautilus if it is installed in your system. Chose that\n  if you want to set it as default and close.\n\nI wanted to set dolphin as my default file manager so installing nautilus isn't the solution.\n\nA: Try this.

Its even annoying than Justin Bieber!!\nAuthenticator is my next nightmare...How do I solve it?\n\nA: I'm not sure I understand your problem (authenticator ??? terminal ? graphical ?)  but in order to install anything the user must have administrator rights. To do so you must connect with your admin user (the first one you created) then go in user accounts application and give administrative rights to the new user.\nAnother problem I can think of is that you have enableb automatic login and you have an application that require administrative rights that starts right after login. You may check in the password wallet (just type key or password in the dash) you can then browse all the stored keys.\n", "Q: Where can i get a live 13.04 image from i am installing Ubuntu Linux on my dads computer. i need a live disk image file for 13.04. i all ready have 10.04 installed,but i would like to be rid of that and have a boot able disk for 13.04.\nwhere can i get one?\n\nA: The Ubuntu website has a download page and a guide for running the Ubuntu 13.04 Live CD.\n", "Q: Hostapd Failed to update rate sets in kernel module I'm getting this error launching hostapd with minimal conf\nFailed to update rate sets in kernel module\n\nI've just installed Ubuntu-GNOME 13.04.

You should be using the same version (e.g. 13.04) and the same architechture (e.g. amd64, 64-Bit) as your currently installed Ubuntu. If you need to download an old version, you can do so at http://releases.ubuntu.com.\nOnce you've booted the disk up, press Ctrl+Alt+T to open a terminal window. In that, type in the following commands:\nsudo mount -t ext4 /dev/sda1 /mnt\nsudo mount --bind /dev /mnt/dev\nsudo mount --bind /proc /mnt/proc\nsudo cp /etc/resolv.conf /mnt/etc/resolve.conf\n\nNote that that last command may fail if you aren't connected to the network. It isn't strictly necessary, so if running it gives you an error, you can simply ignore it.\nAlso, you may need to replace /dev/sda1 with something else, depending on the hard disk partition you have Ubuntu installed on. You can get help with determining the exact line in This Question.\nOnce you've done all of that, we're ready to proceed. In the terminal, enter in this command:\nsudo chroot /mnt\n\nYou'll see the prompt in the terminal change from ubuntu@ubuntu:~$ to something like root@ubuntu:~#. It may be different for your specific machine. This tells us we're ready to install grub. Run this command to do it:\ngrub-install --force /dev/sda\n\nOnce you're finished with this, reboot your computer. It should boot back up into Ubuntu.\nNext we need to add an entry for Windows 8 into Grub, and remove any Windows 7 entries that are still there. To do this, open another terminal window, then enter this command:\nsudo update-grub\n\nThis command will take a minute or two, then you're all set. If you reboot your computer, you should be prompted to boot either Ubuntu or Windows 8.\n", "Q: Multiple-monitor display doesn't work after update to 13.10 I upgraded from 12.04 to 13.10, and after that, my secondary monitor doesn't work anymore.\nA little more info:\n$ xrandr -q\nxrandr: Failed to get size of gamma for output default\nScreen 0: minimum 640 x 480, current 1280 x 1024, maximum 1280 x 1024\ndefault connected 1280x1024+0+0 0mm x 0mm\n   1280x1024       0.0* \n   1024x768        0.0  \n   800x600         0.0  \n   640x480         0.0  \n\n$ lspci | grep VGA\n01:00.0 VGA compatible controller: NVIDIA Corporation GF114 [GeForce GTX 560 Ti] (rev a1)\n\n$ sudo lshw -C video\n  *-display UNCLAIMED     \n       description: VGA compatible controller\n       product: GF114 [GeForce GTX 560 Ti]\n       vendor: NVIDIA Corporation\n       physical id: 0\n       bus info: pci@0000:01:00.0\n       version: a1\n       width: 64 bits\n       clock: 33MHz\n       capabilities: pm msi pciexpress vga_controller bus_master cap_list\n       configuration: latency=0\n       resources: memory:f4000000-f5ffffff memory:e8000000-efffffff memory:f0000000-f3ffffff ioport:e000(size=128) memory:f6000000-f607ffff\n\nEven at login screen, it doesn't detect it at all.\nSo, anyone knows how to fix this?\n\nA: Solved this issue searching for another display-related problem on this upgrade. here are the steps:\nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:xorg-edgers/ppa\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get install nvidia-331 nvidia-settings-331\n\nAnd then restart the computer\n\nA: I had the same problem and sort of panicked but all I had to do was go to control panel, click on Adjust screen resolution under Appearance and Personalization.\nThen adjust monitor 1, monitor 2 and so on accordingly!\nHope this helps\n", "Q: Having several sound issues with Ubuntu 12.04 I'm not exactly describing one problem, because I feel like solving it would be useless. \nIn the last 3 months I had a HUGE amount of problems with my headphone jack / speakers. I am using Ubuntu 12.04 on an Alienware M17x machine. Ever since I installed Ubuntu 3 months ago, a new sound problem came up every day, here is a short list : \n\n\n*\n\n*Without an headphone jack, speakers work fine, but when I put my headphone jack in, sound still plays through my speakers; I have to go through pavucontrol to get the sound to go through my headphone jack (that is actually a very recurrent problem)\n\n*Sound is very low in the headphone jack (barely audible if I go in pavucontrol and put the headphone volume at 150% and the room is quiet).\n\n*Sound goes through both speakers and headphone jack when pavucontrol sets the output to headphone jack\n\n*Microphone input is very low (barely audible as in the previous problem) but the microphone outputs the same thing as my headphone jack is outputting\n\n*etc, etc, etc.\n\n\nAll these problems have one thing in common which pisses me off a lot : I was using my computer (I barely ever turn it off), all the settings were fine at some point, didn't touch anything, and then BAM problem. Very frustrating. I believe a cause might be because updates were done silently while I was using my computer but I admit I never actually noticed that the problems arrived right after an update. Otherwise I have no idea where these magical problems came from. \nSo here's the question : Why could I possibly get all these sound problems out of nowhere? I am not even bothering to ask how to fix them, because more often than not these problems were fixed by... ''dumb fixes'', i.e. go to some parameter in pavucontrol/alsamixer, switch it on then off (or the opposite) (in other words, doing nothing very special) and then BAM problem fixed.

This will lead to re-indexing the whole Dropbox directory though, so you'll have to wait for it to finish before it starts actual synchronization.\n", "Q: Skype in Outlook.com in Ubuntu won't work I wouldn't normally ask a question like this on AskUbuntu - it's more related to web browsers is what some people might say. But, if you read on, you'll see why I'm asking it on this forum:\nIf I go to Outlook.com in Chromium on Ubuntu and go to Outlook.com then click the messaging icon, the pane shows up. Sure enough, at the bottom, it's connected to Messenger and Google. But, there is no Skype, yet in the People section (arrow next to Outlook -> People) it says it's connected to Skype. Also, if I try doing the same on another laptop (Chrome + XP) it works fine, as with a school netbook (IE10 + Win 7). I've tried using a blank temporary profile in Chromium just to let you know, so it's not to do with extensions. To see if it was to do with the browser, I tried using a \"Like Chrome\" user agent (instead of chromium/version -> like chrome/version) - this would make sites think I'm using Chrome, and it worked on whatbrowser.org. But still no luck. Any ideas? And does anyone think I should be asking this on a Microsoft forum?\n\n\nA: I believe the problem lies with the Skype Plugin not being installed for your browser. The page from where to load the plugin is:\nhttps://skypewebexperience.skype.com/content/0-0-0/plugin_installation.html#get-started-page\nHowever, after a couple of clicks the message \"Your download has started.

(Several possible ways) After you have deleted at least one old kernel version package, run dpkg-reconfigure -a to clean up all half installed packages.\nIMHO Ubuntu should make this a little easier, but the method mentioned there works too.\nIf this doesn't help or you need more information, please edit your question and append the output of the following commands:\ndf\ndf -i\nls -la /boot\n\n", "Q: Another preinstalled windows 8(sony vaio), I have no idea what to do next. I recently bought a laptop with preinstalled windows 8. Did a clean install via the installation manager at first and got it to work. Then there was an issue when I tried the ati proprietary drivers that I was unable to resolve so I made a clean install again. How ever this time it won't work and I get the \"no operating system found\" on boot. What can possibly have changed since the first time?\n\nA: Ok, so I managed to solve it by switching to legacy mode in Bios, this way I don't seem to have to use an efi partition or anything and the installation works just as usual. You have to switch before the install though, probably got something to do with grub.\n", "Q: Excessive Resource Use in Syncing Home Folders with Dropbox My situation is that I work close to equally from home and from my workplace's office, and I'm attempting to set up two Ubuntu virtual machines that stay mostly synced with each other. I'm primarily concerned with syncing preferences and files, as I won't change software packages enough to justify attempting to sync that to. \nMy solution was to set up dropbox on both VMs, and create file links from my user home folder into the dropbox folder. The dropbox folder exists in a different directory, with appropriate file permissions, that's not contained by my user's home folder. My VMs are also the same ubuntu version (12.04 64 bit). As far as I can tell the syncing part works correctly. \nMy problem is that dropbox seems to be caught in some kind of recursive situation where it's constantly attempting to sync files that are constantly changing between the two machines. This is most obvious in the data use, as after having had dropbox installed and the VM running for about four days, I started the VM this morning and it's already used 1.5gb of bandwidth to sync a home folder that's only 440mb or so. Dropbox also runs 60% or more CPU use constantly. \nMy question that you guys can answer is what ubuntu related files and folders should I add to the dropbox ignore list so it's not constantly syncing files that change regularly, but are irrelevant to my needs? Is there an error/message log someplace that I should ignore or anything like that?\n\nA: If you are using your home (~/) folder as your Dropbox folder, Dropbox is syncing all your dotfiles, which are hidden configuration files and folders, like ~/.bashrc and the like.  This can make it slow because of the number of files and folders it syncs.\nAs far as I know, the only way to prevent Dropbox from syncing them is through DropboxIgnore.\nA simpler option would be to just set your Dropbox folder to another location.\n", "Q: Wifi connetion does not start at boot at ubuntu 13.04 server I have an ubuntu 13.04 server and want to connect to my network via wifi.

This will show you error messages in the log:\ndmesg | tail 40\n\nYou can find more helpful information about starting services at boot-up time here.\n", "Q: Will any DVD drive work with Ubuntu? I have scourged websites for Samsung / Lite-on/ LG / Asus and none list \"Linux\" in their OS Supported sections.\nIs there a special brand / model of dvd drive for Ubuntu / Linux? Thank you.\n\nA: Generally, most dvd drives use a standard method of communicating with the OS. They have to, too, because everyone expects to be able to boot from them from within the BIOS, which is very bare-bones. The only issue you might run into is playing dvds. \nThat requires some legally questionable libdvdcss stuff, or a $20 player from the Ubuntu Software Centre.\n\nA: Generally should every DVD drive work with Ubuntu.\nI don't know why it should not and never saw one, that didn't worked with Ubuntu, too.\n\nA: Virtually any major brand DVD drive would work.  Samsung, Lite-on, LG, Asus, HP, Sony, and Plextor.  SATA or IDE interface.\n\nA: Yes it should work. If the site doesn't show Linux as supported OS, it doesn't mean that it will not support.\nIn my desktop, I'm using LG DVD/RW Drive, and in my laptop it is Samsungs' DVD Drive. My friends are using HP, Sony, Dell and others laptops with different DVD/RW drives and they never faced any trouble using with Ubuntu.\nIn short yes it should support without any problem...\n", "Q: What are the packages list in Ubuntu? I've seen several times people talking about apt-get and packages list, I know what is apt-get and what it does, but what are the packages lists?\n\nA: The package list, as it names indicates, is the list of all packages contained in all the repositories in your sources.list configuration files. Most of the package managers (including APT) uses packages list.\nThis lists reside in the /var/lib/apt/lists/ directory and apt systems update them whenever you update the lists (please, note that there is a difference between update and upgrade) apt will fetch the lists from the repositories and store it locally for future uses. Whereas you run any command in apt this list are loaded an processed and your commands (like install, remove, upgrade).\nReference:\n\n*\n\n*https://www.debian.org/doc/manuals/debian-reference/ch02.en.html\n", "Q: How can I install more partitions, I have two I think swap and primary I guess? My friend was on skype explaining to me how to install linux so we didn't take whole hard disk space for linux. He said that later I can always edit that and add partitions, I don't even now how to check how much space swap area is allotted to me, I read here it says it should be 4gb I think that we set it to more, I am new to linux, so I am asking for help here, my hard disk is 640 bytes and later I think in few months I will surely install windows 7 because linux looks too complicated to me, but I want to try to take whole hard disk space for linux to use gim for few months maybe I will learn how to use it and everything will be ok. Thanks a lot guys.\n\nA: Open the Software Center and look for GParted. Install and open the program (with root permission) and then you can edit, create and delete partitios.\nAs a note: Always be careful when changing existing partitions. This can lead into loss of data.\nPS: After installing Windows 7, boot your Live Ubuntu (DVD or Stick or whatever you used) and set the boot flag back to the ubuntu partition, so GRUB is used as bootloader again. Afterwards open a terminal and type sudo update-grub. This will refresh GRUB and add Windows 7 to GRUB's OS list. Windows bootloaders can't recognise EXT partitions and therefore can't boot Ubuntu, which is on EXT4 (?) by default.\n", "Q: HP PROBOOK over heating MY hp probook 4530's fan doesnt seem to be turning up when it needs to.

I loose all the frames(frameless) of my current and future windows. And I have noticed the Ubuntu tends to behave strangely(can't define it exactly) to such an extent that restart(didn't try log-off and log-in) seems to be a be better option for me. I don't think tor is the cause of this but I am speaking as per observation.\nWhat could be the reason behind this?\n\nA: You're probably killing processes you didn't intend to. The -f options matches on the full command line:\nThe pattern is normally only matched against the  process  name.\nWhen -f is set, the full command line is used.\n\nTo see which processes you're actually killing, do:\nps wwuxa |grep [t]or\n\nThe actual match as done by pkill is the same as done by pgrep. Compare the PIDs returned by pgrep tor vs. pgrep -f tor.\nyou'll see many processes; since you run pkill with sudo, this means you kill all those processes. My guess is gtk-window-decorator is the one whose absence causes the frames problem you describe. The rest of the strange behavior is due to the other system processes that also died.\nIn this case, since \"tor\" matches several system processes, you should specify a more strict regular expression, and not use -f. This may work:\npgrep  ^tor$\n\nDon't use -f and ensure that it matches only one process, and that the process is indeed tor. Once you're satisfied, you can pkill instead of pgrep.\nFinally, I'm unfamiliar with tor, but perhaps somewhere in the documentation you can find a more correct way to shut it down.\n\nA: Your pkill call kills all processes which have the string tor in their command line (such as monitor or navigator or calculator etc). Thus, I guess you're also killing important processes and end up in an unstable system.\nI recommend stopping tor using:\nsudo service tor stop\n\nor\nsudo /etc/init.d/tor stop \n\n", "Q: Ubuntu 12.10 LTS Wont show my connected Audio outputs When I plug my headphones in I will hear and see nothing from that output.\nNothing happens when I plug my output in, it will stay the same.\nHelp is really appriciated since I need my sound back as soon as possable\n[EDIT]\nHeres my Alsamixer setting, since so many people are asking for it, and I cannot post pictures since my reputation is to low\nCard: HDA NVidia                                     F1:  Help               │\n│ Chip: Realtek ALC662 rev1                            F2:  System information │\n│ View: F3:[Playback] F4: Capture  F5: All             F6:  Select sound card  │\n│ Item: Master [dB gain: 0,00]                         Esc: Exit               │\n\n 100    100<>100 100<>100   0<>0   100<>100 100<>100   100      100\n\n< Master >  PCM     Front   Front Mi Front Mi Surround  Center    LFE   \n\n\n0<>0                                0<>0     0<>0\n\nLine    S/PDIF  S/PDIF D Channel  Rear Mic<Rear Mic>\n\n\nA: Check alsamixer (type it in terminal) levels.

But how can I confirm the command was run to display what I am currently looking at in my screen session? \n\nA: The best way would be to strace the PID.\nFor example; screen sessions are located in /var/run/screen/<screen session>. If you ls in that directory you'll see the PID of the session.\nYou can then strace -p <pid> on that PID. It wont be pretty but it's the closest you'll get.\n\nA: In your case the screen PID is 21200 (according to the screen -ls command). So pstree 21200 will do. Similarly, htop in tree mode (press [F5]) will also see the process tree.\n", "Q: How does selecting \"Use LVM\" in the Ubuntu installer work? I'm installing (L)Ubuntu using Ubiquity from a LiveUSB, and I want to use LVM, since I've read that it can organize my three hard drives to work as a single unit.\nIf I check the box \"Use LVM with the new Ubuntu installation\", does this utilize all my hard drives, or do I have to do manual partitioning/configuration?\nI've searched around, and found some potentially helpful sites, but I can't find anywhere that discuss how Ubiquity uses LVM. Most other sites are quite old (>1yr), and so they all mention that manual setup of LVM is the only method since Ubiquity doesn't utilize LVM yet.\n\nA: After a little bit of experimenting, and help from the LVM HOWTO, I figured out how to do what I was looking for.\nThese steps will work for any number of hard drives, you will just have to modify how many times you do each step. Additionally, these steps can be done either in a LiveUSB or while using the installed OS itself.\nBefore you begin, make sure you know the \"name\" of each of your drives. These can be found using the command sudo fdisk -l. Each drive name will look something like /dev/sda\nInitial Installation\nIf you select \"Use LVM with the new Ubuntu installation\", it will install Ubuntu on a single drive, with volume group (VG) ubuntu-vg, physical volume (PV) /dev/sdx5 (where \"x\" is the letter of the drive used by the installer, usually \"a\"), and logical volumes (LV) /dev/ubuntu-vg/root and /dev/ubuntu-vg/swap_1.\nInitialising Additional Drives for LVM\nBefore your additional hard drives can be used for LVM, you need to turn them into physical volumes. To do so:\n\n\n*\n\n*sudo pvcreate /dev/sdx, where x is the letter of whatever drive you're adding.\n\n\nAdding New Physical Volumes to your Volume Group\nYou then need to add each new physical volume (read, each additional drive) to your volume group. To do so:\n\n\n*\n\n*sudo vgextend ubuntu-vg /dev/sdx\nExtending the Logical Volume and your Filesystem\nThe last step is to extend the LV and your filesystem over the newly-added PVs. To do so:\n\n\n*\n\n*sudo lvextend -l+100%FREE /dev/ubuntu-vg/root -r\nExplanation of command: -l+100%FREE extends the LV over all free space in the VG, /dev/lubuntu-vg/root specifies which LV to expand, and -r expands your filesystem to fill the newly-expanded LV.\nAfter all this, you should be ready to rock-and-roll with your now-large-and-single hard drive.\n", "Q: Why is Software Updater showing additional updates? I have never seen this before until today. Just a moment ago Software Updater displayed itself to me and said I have packages I need to update. Among them was ClamAV, which I have never installed. I did not click the update button and instead went to my command line and typed sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get upgrade and it showed less packages needing to be updated than in the Software Updater GUI.\nWhy is there a difference between what apt-get and what Software Updater think need to be updated? Why did my computer install ClamAV?\nI did a thorough check before continuing with the Software Updater, and noticed that I don't have any form of ClamAV installed on my computer. \nWhy is Software Updater telling me I should update ClamAV if it isn't even installed to begin with? Do newer versions of Ubuntu now include ClamAV as part of the base installation? \nI'm not against running ClamAV on my system, although I'm certain I have no need for anti-virus on my Linux machines, since they are secure through obscurity. What I am concerned about, though, is why the Ubuntu Software Updater is showing more updates than apt-get and why it is showing updates for software I do not have installed.\n\nA: You asked \"why?\" and luckily there is a command that is called the same why in aptitude:\naptitude why clamav\ni   cron         Suggests exim4 | postfix | mail-transport-agent\np   postfix      Suggests mail-reader                           \np   kmail-mobile Provides mail-reader                           \np   kmail-mobile Suggests clamav\n\nAs you can see, cron suggests postfix, which suggests mail-reader, which suggests kmail-mobile. This is in my specific case, in your's the reason might be even more obscure or bizarre. So, why did your update-manager decided to install clamav* package? The Update Manager doesn't use the same tactics as apt-get upgrade, rather it uses apt-get dist-upgrade which is more aggressive in trying to install and remove packages that you may (or may not) need. \nI'm sure somewhere you have a a package of a recommendation of a recommendation of a suggestion that makes update-manager install some clamav related package and this at the same time pulls the entire clamav baggage.\naptitude why dansguardian clamav\np   dansguardian Depends clamav (>= 0.80)\n\n", "Q: I can't boot after Ubuntu installation I have just installed Ubuntu 13.04, yet I had problems getting into any of the systems after installation [I had Windows 7 installed before].\nThe problem is, that after installation and restart, I didn't get the option to boot Ubuntu, only previous Windows Vista [which I replaced with Ubuntu] and Windows 7.

I am not quite sure what is happening here. Every time I type cat to open a file I get cat: abod: No such file or directory. I am trying to open a file from LibreOffice using \"cat blog.odt\" Any body knows what I am doing wrong?\n\nA: I guess that simply means what it says, the file is not in the directory you are in. Check with ls -la and look for your file in the list it gives you. Also you can hit tab twice and get the choices you have and see if it's there. Plus, get ready to see lots of garbage, cat is not libreofice. \n\nA: You must either be \"in\" the directory of the file, or use the full path to the file when trying to cat it. Also cat does not open a file in libre office, unless there are some special options I am not aware of, all it will do is dump the contents of the file out onto the console. You can also use cat to add lines of text into a file but that is not what you are trying to do either.\nMost likely you can just type libreoffice /home/$USER/path/to/blog.odt and that will open the file in libreoffice. Note that $USER needs to be replaced with your name if it is not set as an environment variable. And /path/to/blog.odt needs to be the path from your home folder, not your desktop, to where ever blog.odt is.\nFor example if it was in a folder called \"blog_stuff\" on your Desktop, and your username was bob, the command would look like libreoffice /home/bob/Desktop/blog_stuff/blog.odt\nLet tab completion become your friend in this, that is hitting tab twice while typing a path, it will either auto complete or show you the list of possibilities that match what you have typed so far.\n\nA: cat just prints the contents of a file to your terminal. Since ODT is a compressed format, you will not get any meaningful output using cat on those files.\nI suspect that the command you are really looking for is xdg-open -- this will open the specified file with whatever the default application is set to for that file type. It's equivalent to double-clicking on a file in your GUI file manager. Use it like:\nxdg-open file.odt\n## or:\nxdg-open /path/to/file.odt\n\n...but make sure that you are in the correct directory. Also, for some bizarre reason xdg-open can only work on one file at a time, so you'll have to use a loop if you want to open multiple files, something like:\nfor f in file1.odt file2.pdf; do xdg-open \"$f\"; done\n\n", "Q: Ubuntu won't let me enter my root password When I was installing a program, it said that I needed to run it as a normal account rather than an administrator account, and so, being the inexperienced person that I am, changed my account to Standard rather than Administrator.\nWhen I went to change it back, I clicked unlock, and entered my password (the only password I have ever used for this computer), and it said that my authentication attempt was unsuccessful. \nI've tried changing my password in the recovery mode before booting, and it still doesn't work.

I noticed a lot of other related questions, but none of those answers are working for me. I am trying to kill the following session:\nscreen -ls\nThere is a screen on:\n    23520.pts-6.porkypig    (09/30/2013 02:49:47 PM)    (Detached)\n1 Socket in /var/run/screen/S-root.\n\nscreen -r 23520.pts-6.porkypig\n\nNow I am in the session. According to the documentation:\nhttp://www.gnu.org/software/screen/manual/screen.html#Quit\nI am supposed to press \"control a\" and then \"control \\\". I do that and nothing happens.\nAnother solution said to  press Ctrl+a and type :quit. However, again it doesn't do anything. In fact, pressing control+a, absolutely nothing happens afterwards except a message \"No Other Window\"\n\nA: Like you, I wanted to kill my screen session and found the documentation unhelpful. Convinced that there must be a keyboard shortcut, I found that\nctrl + a then \\\nworks\nI then get the prompt:\n\"Really quit and kill all your windows [y\\n]\"\nI am not sure why the documentation says ctrl + a then ctrl + \\. That doesn't do anything for me.\n\nA: I encountered this problem when updating screen. The screen command would hang when attempting to reattach the session, regardless of how many -D or -R I added to the command. However, screen -ls conveniently provides the pid of the session, allowing you to intervene using the following:\n10:42 user ~ $ screen -ls\nThere is a screen on:\n        5730.my_screen     (Detached)\n1 Socket in /tmp/screens/S-user.\n\n10:42 user ~ $ sudo kill 5730\n\n10:43 user ~ $ screen -ls\nNo Sockets found in /tmp/screens/S-user.\n\n(This is similar to Brian Thomas's answer, but his will kill all running screen sessions, which may not be what you want if you have multiple screens open but only one misbehaving.)\n\nA: You can find the process id of the attached running screen. I found it same as the session id which you can get by command:\nscreen -ls\nAnd you can use following command to kill that process:\nkill [sessionId] or \nsudo kill [sessionId]\nYou can kill the screen even if it is attached on some other terminal window.\n\nA: we can also use the exit command to terminating screen\n\nA: first you need to re attach to the screen session\nscreen -r 23520 as you have done. Then press ctrl + a and then a k and press y when it asks if you really want to kill the session\nSource\n\nA: *\n\n*Identify the name of the session:\n\n $ screen -ls\n\n\n\n*Close a session:\n\n$ screen -XS <session-id> quit\n\n\n*\n\n*Rationale: -X = Execute command, -S session PID to execute on\n\n*Example: screen -XS 20411 quit\n\n*Source: innaM's Answer\n\nA: You can use this to kill a session\nscreen -X -S <name> kill\n\n\nA: This command will kill all screen sessions, if that is desired:\nSo with all those official suggestions, I have one here that i feel is easier, and just as effective, and kind of more straight forward:\npkill screen\nWho wants to go into an unknown and un-needed screen just to press in a couple commands that most might barely remember?   This avoids going into it at all, and kills it straight off.\nPlus, if you have more than one, this will take them all in one fell swoop.\n\nA: This will kill all the detached screens:\n\nscreen -ls | grep detached | cut -d. -f1 | awk '{print $1}' | xargs kill\n\nThis will kill all screens, attached or detached\n\nscreen -ls | grep pts | cut -d. -f1 | awk '{print $1}' | xargs kill\n\n\nA: Press ctrl+d to kill screen window. Repeat this until you kill all screen windows. Once you ran out all windows screen will kill the session and terminating. Shortest solution if you not having many windows\n\nA: You can just simply type exit while in a recording mode, I found out it to be most convenient as it directly exits the running screen.\n\nA: Simply, use the exit command inside a screen window and if you have a running process press control + z before that.\n\nA: I believe what is being asked is how to 'quit' a screen session from within screen itself. This would kill all open terminals in the session and leave the user at the prompt for the parent terminal. The session can be suspended from within using CTRL-A, CTRL-Z. But this creates a a problem I'm trying to avoid which is leaving a bunch of opened screen sessions over time and then not knowing which ones are truly active and which ones I should have closed.\nAfter lots of looking, I believe there is no way to do this. Killing them using the PID method is ok, but if there are many sessions open, some of which I might be using, I don't always know which ones to kill.\nSo what I do when I'm truly done with a screen session is to repeatedly hit CTRL-d to close each terminal individuly until the session completely exits.\nThis is the best solution I've found.\n", "Q: Package 'cmake' has no installation candidate ubuntu 12.04 When I run \nsudo apt-get install cmake\n\nI get the following response:\nPackage cmake is not available, but is referred to by another package.\nThis may mean the package is missing, has been obsoleted, or is only available from another source\n\nE: Package 'cmake' has no installation candidate\n\nHow do I install cmake?\n\nA: I faced the same problem and after googling a bit, I become able to install cmake.

I've checked monitors, cables, even borrowed an expansion base and used those outputs and it still does it. \n\nA: Normally this would be caused by a hardware failure. If you have replaced the cables try a different monitor. If the different monitor works, then the problem is the monitor. If a different monitor is still blue, then it's likely the mother board. \nA fast way to tell, is the color blue during boot?

The spacing between header / footer and main page content is set on the header / footer properties tab of the page's properties dialogue.\nSo:\n\n\n*\n\n*to increase the space between header and the top of the main content area, you need to increase the spacing value on the Header tab of the Page Style dialogue (Menu Format -> Page).\n\n*to keep the top border of the main content area and to \"move\" the header upwards, you need to modify two values: decrease the page's top margin, and increase the spacing between header and main content by the same value.\n\n\nFor a visual description how the different page/header/footer properties affect the page layout, see my answer on superuser.\n\nA: Double click near the top of the page to show the header, and then drag the header slider up, and may have to drag the page slider down, and that will put the header, and footer outside the boarder (Notice the border in the images).  Keep in mind that it might make it smaller.

Is it possible to leave Gparted on the system after installation, seeing as it is already on the LiveUSB? As a related question, why is it removed from the final system in the first place?\n\nA: As user320 explained, you can install GParted through the Software Center or sudo apt-get install gparted. As for your second question, I believe the reason why GParted is not a part of the final installation is because Canonical decided to go with Disk Utility, which is a lighter version of GParted. The idea is to give the end user direct and clear access to simple but effective utilities; providing them with power tools from the get go can be confusing and maybe even dangerous. Power users, on the other hand, can find those power tools on their own.\nIt's basically the same rationale that made them let go of Synaptic in favor of a more pumped-up Software Center. Back in the day, both Synaptic and GParted were default applications.\n\nA: Gparted isn't installed as part of the installation process, unless you have a customized image you're installing with. You can either install it through the terminal or The Software Center.\nUsing the Command Line\nOpen the terminal with Ctrl + Alt + T\nsudo apt-get install gparted\n\nto launch it.\nsudo gparted\n\nSoftware Center\nJust search for 'gparted' and install, thats it.\n\nThanks to Thomas W.\n\nA: Gparted is not removed, it is just not installed.

After only using my computer for short periods of time (often less than a minute), my root partition (Ext 4, /dev/sda5) become read-only without warning. This happens constantly, and I'm not sure why. I'm really hoping not to have to do a fresh install.\nI've tried rebooting, but the routine fsck that Ubuntu performs during boot fails to fix the partition. If I either let it boot and press M to manually recover, or boot in recovery mode and use a root terminal, I can usually fix the issue using fsck -f -v -y /dev/sda5. It's worth noting that I've also tried using a live USB stick (with Linux Mint on it), and running fsck from there. Also, I used the old version of Pared Magic that comes with version 15.0 of Hiren's Boot CD.\nHowever, the issue rears it's ugly head almost instantly when I reboot, regardless of how I run fsck.

Harddrives are known to fail.\nIf you are running the main edition of Ubuntu, it includes a great tool called Disks from Gnome (search from the launcher to access it).\nYou can select your drive on the left and then if you click on the gear icon at the top right hand side, you will get a menu and you can select \"smart data and tests\".\nFrom there you can run smart tests (\"start self-test...\" button at the bottom left hand side), I suggest the extended option to initiate a thorough test of the drive.\n\n\nA: Backup your data and change your HD soon because you might experience a serious data loss.\nAfter the backup, you can force the HD to use the default settings (and always be read-write) by editing /etc/fstab with the command sudo nano /etc/fstab: in the fourth colon of the root filesystem entry replace the error option with the defaults option.\nExample (from my PC):\nUUID=fa7667f8-e8a4-44d9-8e51-92fb2496c8c1 / ext4 errors=remount-ro 0 1\n...edit it to:\nUUID=fa7667f8-e8a4-44d9-8e51-92fb2496c8c1 / ext4 defaults 0 1\nIt is not a good practice and if your HD is really damaged you might cause more damage when you (or your software) write to it, this is the reason of the original errors=remount-ro in fstab file.\nBackup your fstab file before doing any change and NEVER copy-paste anything to it, only edit manually.\nThe basic guide to fstab file (for your personal knowledge): man fstab\nA full guide is online, but isn't file-system independent and might change in the time; you can use it if the defaults option doesn't work.\nA suggestion is to enable the S.M.A.R.T. technology in your BIOS if you have it, because it will enable you to see with a good anticipation the state of your HD (it can save your work!) with specific software.\nSorry for the bad news but it happened also to me some time ago, it's a bad feeling.\n\nA: Just to update anyone who cares, I decided to replace the HD, and copy as much of my data as possible.

Please help me out why does it gives error in access and also this whole process gets killed at the end?\nPlease give me some direction that what can be the potential reasons behind this.\n\n\nA: The fact that your program calls brk(2) so many times (8843) leads me to think that your code is requesting too much memory from the system. And generally, on Linux, when a program requests too much memory, it is killed with SIGKILL.\nMore details\nbrk(2) is one of the two ways a program has to request memory. The other way is mmap(2). The malloc(3) and friends implementations offered by the GNU C Library use a mix of the two.\nGenerally speaking, whatever way your program allocates memory, Linux does not complain. Even if no memory is available, it is possible that the kernel still return valid addresses.\nThat's because Linux allocates memory lazily, in the sense that memory is not \"physically allocated\" until you start using it. This is a great performance optimization.\nNow, what happens when you try to use some memory, but your system's RAM and swap are full? If Linux has allocated your memory physically, then there are no problems. Else, a component called OOM killer starts killing processes that consume most of the memory, with the aim of keeping the system usable.\nAbout access\nYou noted that strace -c is reporting 4 access(2) failures. This is surely not a symptom of a problem. It is perfectly fine for a system call to fail. Problems occur when your program does not handle failures.\nAn example:\n$ strace -e trace=stat -- ls /abc \nstat(\"/abc\", 0x1df2e30)                 = -1 ENOENT (No such file or directory)\nls: cannot access /abc: No such file or directory\n+++ exited with 2 +++\n\nI've told ls to list the contents of a non-existent directory (/abc), therefore the call to stat(2) has failed with ENOENT. This is not a problem for ls itself: it has detected the failure and displayed an error message.\nProblems would have occurred if ls didn't check the return value of stat(2).\nAbout your specific problem: it's difficult to know why access has failed. The output of strace -e trace=access or strace -C would give you some hits. However I firmly believe that such failures are not a problem for you, as they probably come from the GNU C Library:\n$ strace -e trace=access -- ls\naccess(\"/etc/ld.so.nohwcap\", F_OK)      = -1 ENOENT (No such file or directory)\naccess(\"/etc/ld.so.preload\", R_OK)      = -1 ENOENT (No such file or directory)\naccess(\"/etc/ld.so.nohwcap\", F_OK)      = -1 ENOENT (No such file or directory)\naccess(\"/etc/ld.so.nohwcap\", F_OK)      = -1 ENOENT (No such file or directory)\n...\n\n", "Q: I may be stupid but I can't find my terminal window, I just installed version 12.04.3, Help I can't find my terminal window, I just installed version 12.04.3, Help..\n\nA: Try pressing Ctrl+Alt+T to bring up terminal.\nAlternatively, you can press the Windows key (which brings up a search area), and type Terminal which should show you the Terminal icon.

This seems like the cleanest option, and would make life very simple indeed.\n\n\n*A way to make a copy of EVERYTHING from my existing Ubuntu install onto a virtual machine, leaving me free to delete the Linux partitions, and use Ubuntu via VM only.\nScenario 1 is preferred.\nThanks for your help.\n\nA: For the first scenario:\nYou can try to start Ubuntu in a chroot. For this you should install any Linux on your VM. Mount all your Ubuntu partitions there.\nThen mount your /proc /sys and /dev and startx as explained in How to start GNOME session from chainroot?\nmount -t proc none path_to_chroot/proc/\nmount -t sysfs none path_to_chroot/sys/\nmount -o bind /dev path_to_chroot/dev/\n\nHere is a bash script to run chrooted Ubuntu, which you can edit for your needs:\n#!/bin/bash\nmount --bind /dev /media/disk/dev\nmount --bind /proc /media/disk/proc\nmount --bind /sys /media/disk/sys\nmount --bind /dev/pts /media/disk/dev/pts\ncp /etc/resolv.conf /media/disk/etc/resolv.conf\nchroot /media/disk\n\nFor the second scenario:\nCheck out these questions on SuperUser\n\n*\n\n*Make image of existing Ubuntu installation for VirtualBox\n\n*Linux-live-cd-flash-preinstalled\nAlso using this tutorial you should do a remastersys backup, that means that you will do a full system backup including your home folder, all applications and all your data into .iso image. Put this image on USB hard drive, or just to Windows NTFS partition. Then you can install your Ubuntu in VirtualBox using this .iso file.\n", "Q: root-system-bin package installation for root login What is the use of root-system-bin package? After installing this package can we able to login into the system as root user?\n\nA: No, it's a numerical analysis application. Its package description:\nDescription-en: Numerical data analysis framework - general applications\n The ROOT system provides a set of OO frameworks with all the\n functionality needed to handle and analyze large amounts of data\n efficiently.\n .\n With the data defined as a set of objects, specialized storage methods\n can give direct access to the separate attributes of the selected\n objects, without having to touch the bulk of the data. Included are\n histogramming methods in 1, 2 and 3 dimensions, curve fitting, function\n evaluation, minimization, graphics and visualization classes to allow the\n easy creation of an analysis system that can query and process the data\n interactively or in batch mode.\n .\n The command language, the scripting (or macro) language, and the\n programming language are all C++, thanks to the built-in CINT C++\n interpreter. This interpreter removes the time consuming compile/link\n cycle, allowing for fast prototyping of the macros, and providing a\n good environment to learn C++. If more performance is needed, the\n interactively developed macros can be compiled using a C++ compiler.\n .\n The system has been designed in such a way that it can query its\n databases in parallel on MPP machines or on clusters of workstations\n or high-end PCs. ROOT is an open system that can be dynamically\n extended by linking external libraries. This makes ROOT a premier\n platform on which to build data acquisition, simulation and data\n analysis systems.\n\nMore here: http://root.cern.ch\nIf you want to enable root login, you should search the site:\n\n\n*\n\n*How to enable root login?\n", "Q: Windows boot problems I have installed Boot Repair and now I boot Ubuntu and Windows 8 from the GRUB. However, the problem I have been facing is that my Windows frequently hangs during boot and I can never shut down properly whenever that happens. As a result, when I subsequently boot to Ubuntu I cannot access the files on the various partitions other than those on the Ubuntu ext4 partition. I once performed \"Automatic Repair\" on Windows 8 (after a Windows boot failure and restart) and consequently the GRUB ceased to be the default boot loader. Hence I had to boot to Ubuntu manually and run Boot Repair again. I wonder what has been going wrong. Does disabling Secure Boot cause these problems? Any help would be much appreciated. \n\nA: Windows 8 acts differently than previous Windows when you shut it down.  \nHere is a good article about the Hybrid boot and shutdown.  The big picture is a restart is the only way to do a traditional full shutdown without using DOS or scripts.  If Windows doesn't put itself in a state where it's partition can be accessed (for example in hibernate you shouldn't be able to access it) then Ubuntu will not be able to mount the Drive.  So you have to find out why it's hanging on this hybrid boot or shutdown.  \nAlso I've found with Windows 8, and haven't found the answer to this, that when you change files on the NTFS partition with Ubuntu, Windows often does not detect it and thinks there are file system errors.  I can make a test file in a folder on NTFS, and Windows 8 won't detect it.  Even worse, if I change a file or move files, Windows detects errors.  I have come to the point where I won't do any write operations on my NTFS partition.  I created a Shared EXFAT partition that both operating systems use to share files.  Sad that I had to use that (and still Windows won't see Linux created files on that).  Last time Windows \"repaired\" my drive because Ubuntu wrote files to it, Windows set all my folder permissions to Administrator and it couldn't load user settings. \n", "Q: Grub menu entry misnamed I recently installed Several OSes on my computer. I have a harddrive with windows, and one that shares ubuntu studio and Kubuntu. Now, my question is, when i boot up the computer, and im loaded into grub2 (also note, im using the UEFI version), It lists ubuntu studio as just plain ubuntu. This isnt really a problem as much as just a minor peeve. I could live with it, but, I wanted to know- how does one change the name in the grub menu. I know on older versions of grub, grub.cfg was a pretty simple looking file, but now its an ugly thing with no clear answers for me. I just want to change the order of a few entries, and rename a couple ^^ \nAnyone able to help me?\n\nA: I used GRUB Customizer with some success. It can do what you want and has a GUI.\nInstall it by\nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:danielrichter2007/grub-customizer\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get install grub-customizer\n\nAnd then start it like any installed application and authenticate yourself. The program needs this as it is editing the fstab-file.  \nFind the entry named \"Ubuntu\" and change it by clicking on the name twice (no double-click). Enter \"Ubuntu Studio\" for example. Don't forget to hit \"Save\" and you're good to go.\nBe careful though, messing with GRUB, especially with many installed OSs on one machine, is always dangerous. ;)\n", "Q: Invalid password 13.0 I had installed 64 bit Ubuntu 13.04 on my desktop.

Neither of them works.\nAnybody knows what am I ought to do now? Maybe making the GRUB option Windows 7 turning on the Windows 7 straight away?\nThank you!\n\nA: Boot form your Windows 7 CD and open a terminal. (Windows cmd.exe)\nNow type the following command: bootrec /FixMBR. See if it worked. If not, use bootrec /FixBoot. This will overwrite GRUB! Now you can only boot Windows 7.\nNow boot from Live Ubuntu and follow these steps:\nsudo mount /dev/sdaX /mnt    #replace X by the partition where Ubuntu is installed\nsudo grub-install /dev/sda --root-directory=/mnt\nsudo reboot\n\nNow you should have a new GRUB.

So, even I have a problem but I am still excited about it :). I recently installed Ubuntu Server edition 12.04 however I figured out that it did not install any GUI (as expected) as it is a server opposed to desktop. Now, I would like to install some stuff like the Gnome/KDE or alternative desktops. I know I need the internet for that however I do not have ethernet configured. I can only use Wifi-dongle (USB-N10) from Asus which is basic and requires software I believe. In other words, I can't run apt-get to install further stuff into it.

You need the packages files (which are basically .deb files) from an Internet enabled PC, and then use those files to install software on your PC.\nLook at this question for detail instruction: How can I install software or packages without Internet (offline)?.\nFor your second question, I suggest you to create another separate question with mentioning your specific USB device.

It gets overwritten by the Windows bootloader.\n\nA: It sounds like your current state is a working Ubuntu installation on a GUID Partition Table (GPT) disk. (There's no such thing as a disk that's \"partitioned as UEFI,\" so I'm assuming you meant GPT here. If not, please double-check how the disk was partitioned by typing sudo parted /dev/sda print | grep Partition. The result should be Partition Table: gpt or Partition Table: msdos.)\nIf my assumption is correct, you can do one of two things, at least on recent (~2-year-old or newer) hardware:\n\n\n*\n\n*Install Windows 7 in EFI mode. A Google turned up this page describing how to do this, but I don't vouch for the directions. Try your own Web search or ask on a Windows forum if you need help with this. Once this is done, you may need to re-install GRUB or some other boot loader. Boot Repair is one relatively easy way to do this; or you could replace GRUB with rEFInd or some other EFI boot loader.\n\n*Convert the disk from GPT to MBR (the gdisk program can do this; see here for details), install Windows, and then re-install GRUB (Boot Repair is one relatively easy way to do this).\n\n\nIf your computer doesn't support EFI-mode booting, the first of those options won't work.

I tried to open file 10.txt in http://www.ohjelmointiputka.net/tiedostot/mpera.zip by Gedit. However, there seems to be some problems. Is this a bug of a Gedit or is that file somehow corrupted?

It also can be opened in gedit, but it does not display correctly, possibly due to the fact that 10.txt is a large (736.3 kB) text file without any linefeeds. If you don't want to install anything it also can be opened in nano, but 10.txt looks more readable when it is opened using Emacs. Because 10.txt is easy to read in Emacs, it is possible to see that 10.txt does not appear to be corrupted, although the text looks like code and not like language.\n", "Q: How to disable Bit Torrent Client There is a lot of traffic generated by my Transmission Bit Torrent client which I don't use at all.

It doesn't run unless you run it. If it is responsible for any bandwidth, you or somebody else on the computer is using it to download or upload torrents.\nSo the simplest answer: stop using it.\nIf you're seeing network traffic at router level, check to see if it's actually transmission that's responsible. ps aux | grep transmission will show you any processes with transmission in their name.\nEdit: you can remove it with a simple sudo apt-get remove transmission{,-gtk} and that won't hurt Ubuntu. ubuntu-desktop just \"recommends\" transmission-gtk so it won't tank the system per my last version.\n\nA: I got to know the cause of it.

For more information: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_WLAN_channels#Interference_Concerns\nFrom your router configuration, I assume that you are not in North America, but some wifi cards (and drivers) by default enforce the North America regulations. Some cards allow you to change this setting, and some don't. You can try this solution and see if it works for you: How to use Wi-Fi channels above 11?\nI have the same problem with an Asus EEEPC, but I cannot change the country with those instructions.

So, I created /etc/grub.d/01_security, stored usernames and passwords in there, made the file executable and ran update-grub. This is working as intended, every action in the menu prompts for username and password, but I also want to modify the automatically generated entries to either restrict them to certain users (via --users) or make them available for everyone, but not editable by everyone (via --unrestricted).\nI was able to find the proper lines in 10_linux and edit them accordingly, however I'd love to see an easier solution.

And if so, how can I tell it to not overwrite my configs?\nEDIT: I rebuilt the package with debuild and then installed with dpkg -i, in case that matters.\n\nA: when you say \"modified configurations\", do you mean you added some config files in /etc/somewhere, or that you compiled the package with different options?\nIf the former, then those files, if declared as configuration files, should not be touched when upgrading, as per Debian policy: http://www.debian.org/doc/debian-policy/ch-files.html.\nIf the latter, then well yes, apt-get is doing what you ask: it's entirely upgrading the package (and all its binaries) with a new version. If you want to exclude a package from the upgrade process (rather, if you want to keep a specific version of a package regardless of whether an updated version is available), then you need to \"pin\" the package.

My problem is that the system thinks that my external monitor is much smaller than it is, so it makes everything (fonts, icons, etc) on that screen too big.\nHere's a screen shot of what the system thinks my monitors look like:\n\nAnd here's a photo of the actual set up:\n\nLook at the size of that terminal window on the external! It's unpleasant to use. It looks to me like the system recognises the correct resolution of the external, and can tell that it's significantly smaller than that of the laptop (the external is a few years old), but I'd really like to tell it that the actual size of the monitor is larger. Is there a way to do that?\n\nA: Things on the external monitor are larger because the pixels on the screen are physically larger.\nMost external desktop monitors have a pixel density of around 100 Pixels-Per-Inch (PPI). This means that one inch has 100 pixels going across it. This is pretty small, but many things go much smaller.\nYour Galago has a 14.1 inch display running at 1920x1080. This translates to about 156 Pixels per inch. In order to cram more pixels into the same physical space (one inch), the pixels have to be much smaller -- around 50% in this case. \nThis is what makes everything smaller on the Galago and larger on the external monitor.\nThe problem lies with the differences between physical screen size and logical screen size. The physical size of the display is pretty simple to visualize; it's just the distance from one corner to the other. The Logical size is the actual screen resolution. So your Galago and a Bonobo Extreme both have the same logical screen size (since they both have the same resolution), despite having wildly different physical sizes. \nIt's similar to scaling up an image in Gimp, or zooming in in Firefox. The physical size of the image gets larger, while the logical size (the pixel dimensions of the image) stay the same.\nFuture versions of Ubuntu that use Mir will allow for resolution independence, where the size of objects on the screen aren't determined by the pixel density. They use special Grid Units (GU) to design an application. Then all of the Grid Units get turned into physical pixels by Mir. So this means that if a Grid Unit is an inch wide, and the Unity Launcher is one Grid Unit wide, then it will be one inch wide on both a high-density display (like your Galago's built-in display) and one inch wide on Low-Density Displays (like the external monitor).\n(By the way, thanks for ordering a Galago! I work for System76, and it's always fun to see our stuff in the wild!)\n", "Q: Is it possible to have 2 os in the same pc? I am currently using Windows 7 Ultimate and am interested in Ubuntu OS.

Do you normally use Gedit or any other editor popular for scripting bash?\n\n*: ${TEMPDIR:=/tmp}\nCan you explain what this is? I have programming knowledge of C# and other programming languages. So can you tell me, assuming I'm not total newbie at programming, what the : key and the curly bracket keys do? \n\n*if [[ \"$Line2\" > \"$Line1\" ]]; then\n[] is same as test. But why does [[]] do any different?\n\n*status1=$?\nwhat is $? ? \nMany thanks in advance. \n\nA: Yes you have indent in Gedit. Open gedit and at Edit-> Preferences you can have the automatic indent option. \nAbout the second point , its saying like assume the TEMPDIR is at /tmp location.\n\nA: *\n\n*I use vim for writing shell scripts.\n\n*${TEMPDIR} will expand to the value of the variable named TEMPDIR. ${TEMPDIR:=/tmp} will do the same, but if it's empty (or unset), the value /tmp will be assigned to TEMPDIR, and also expanded.\nHaving ${TEMPDIR:=/tmp} alone on a line, will cause it to be changed to e.g. /tmp which will try to execute /tmp as a command (which will obviously fail, since you can't execute a directory). That's why the : (null) command is used. The null command ignores all input, all arguments, and does absolutely nothing. Run help : to see the description of that builtin command.\nSee http://mywiki.wooledge.org/BashFAQ/073 For the various things you can do with Parameter Expansion.\n\n*[[ \"$line2\" > \"$Line1\" ]]  returns true if line2 sorts after line1 (like strcmp in C). \n[(\"test\" command) and [[ (\"new test\" command) are used to evaluate expressions. [[ works only in Bash, Zsh and the Korn shell, and is more powerful; [ and test are available in POSIX shells.\nSee http://mywiki.wooledge.org/BashFAQ/031 for the dfference between the [ command and the [[ keyword.\n\n*? is a special parameter that holds the exit status of the last command executed.  $? expands the value of that parameter.\nOn a side note, if that's an example from your book, I'd say that's a poor source for learning bash. I recommend reading http://mywiki.wooledge.org/BashGuide which also teaches good practices.\n\nA: *\n\n*To indent code in Gedit press the Tab key, and Shift-Tab to unindent. All the information you need and the hotkeys list is at Gnome Documentation section for gedit\n\n\n*The : command is a built-in Bash command that does nothing except return 0 (true); but in this case serves to permit the evaluation of the parameter expansion ${VAR:=VALUE} which assigns VALUE to $VAR only if it doesn't exist. If $VAR (in your case $TEMPDIR) already has a value it is not modified. It is equivalent to the construct:\n[[ -z \"$TEMPDIR\" ]] && TEMPDIR=/tmp\n\ni.e., \"if $TEMPDIR is empty, evaluate command at the right (assign /tmp to TEMPDIR)\".\n\n\n*The [[ command is a built-in Bash command (as also [ and test; they have executable equivalents too). The command [[ has several pros and cons versus [ or test.\nPros: It is a built-in command, so is faster, and it has more functionality, like regular expression checking and parsing (remember: man bash is your friend) and doesn't need to escape some operands.\nCons: It is not portable as it has different operators available in each of the shell interpreters where it exists.\n\n\n*The expression $? is, as the terminology in man bash states, a special parameter that resolves or \"expands\" to the exit status of the last command. If the last command was successful it should return true (0 for Bash), so $? will be a numeric zero; in other cases, $? will be the number returned by the command. For example this command line will show the error value returned by ls trying to find the file a-nonexistent-file.txt:\nls a-nonexistent-file-txt ; echo $?\n\nBash as a programming language has a lot of quirks and peculiarities; studying the Bash manual is the route to success.\n[Sorry for the apparent duplicate answer, but the others were unespecific and don't answered all the questions as they were asked (not meaning offense; I learned a couple of unrelated things there).]\n", "Q: Is it possible to install Ubuntu on my iMac OSX 10.8.5? it's possible to  install Ubuntu on my  iMac OSX 10.8.5....  \nDo You guys have any tutorial on  because I am a dummy... or somewhere where I can learn.\n\nA: Yes, it is very much possible, download ubuntu from the Ubuntu Downloads Page and then either Create a bootable flash disk or Burn it onto DVD and then restart your machine with the either the disc inside the machine or the flash disk attached to the usb port. \nI beleive noboy is a dummy, but if you really are not getting it, Click this link to see detailed information and procedures on the installation process.\n", "Q: How to launch a terminal from script and another script to run in terminal I run a script when I log in that basically looks like this:\nchromium-browser &\nxchat &\ncd ~/randomdir && gnome-terminal &\nqbittorrent &\n\nOn the third line (cd ~/randomdir && gnome-terminal &), I would like to run another script in the terminal that I'm opening up.

I'll try to explain more precisely:\nUsually the logo of acer is displayed briefly and Windows loads shortly after that. When I start with the disk, the logo is displayed and the drive comes indeed to life, but then nothing happens. It just shows the logo.\n\nA: Have you enabled UEFI boot in your BIOS? You can access that under the Advanced Settings tab for your BIOS - you can access the settings by pressing F8 (or F2 or F10) when you see your manufacturers logo during boot up. It should be the first logo you should see. \nAlso, which version of Ubuntu are you using?\n\nA: Something of a long shot, but try this:\n\n\n*\n\n*Download the USB flash drive version of my rEFInd boot manager.\n\n*Prepare a USB flash drive with rEFInd.\n\n*Reboot and tell the computer to boot from the USB flash drive, with the Ubuntu DVD in your DVD drive. rEFInd should appear, and it should give options to boot Windows and to boot from the DVD. If you don't see a DVD option, hit Esc to tell rEFInd to re-scan your devices.\n\n*Select the DVD option in rEFInd.\n\n\nThis might fix the problem, and even if it doesn't, the way it fails might provide more clues about what's going wrong.\nAnother option is to copy the Ubuntu DVD image to a USB flash drive. If you've got an existing Linux system, use dd for this, as in sudo dd if=image.iso of=/dev/sdc to copy image.iso to the USB flash drive on /dev/sdc. Be very careful with this command! A mistake can do serious damage to the target device (specified via of=). Once Ubuntu's on the USB flash drive, you can try booting from it.\n", "Q: How to use Alt+Shift to switch keyboard layouts? I recently upgraded to Ubuntu 13.10, with the new keyboard handling system. The little \"switch keyboard\" option does not let me set it to Alt+Shift. How can I get this keyboard binding, as I have absolutely no interest in using the Mac-esque Super+Space combo?\n\nA: A confirmed bug in Ubuntu 13.10 prevents users from switching layouts using combinations like Alt+Shift, Caps Lock, Ctrl+Shift etc.\nThe bug affects many people, its importance is set to \"High\", so we may expect that an official fix will be released soon. You can subscribe to notifications about this bug on launchpad.net, so that you receive an email when it's done. \nCurrently, a patch aimed at resolving this issue is being tested. By now it seems to work for most users, though certain problems remain. To install the patch, use the following commands:\nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:attente/modifier-only-input-switch\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get upgrade\n\nA system reboot was needed in my case to make it work (simple log out and log in may be sufficient).\nNote: Originally, the patch was located at ppa:attente/1218322. If you have previously installed it from there, you can first purge it as follows\nsudo ppa-purge ppa:attente/1218322\n\nand then execute the three commands above.\nAlternatively, you may consider using a combination containing a non-modifier key (a letter, digit, space): try, for instance, Alt+Shift+Space (this will work without installing any patches).\nNote that the keyboard shortcuts for switching layouts still do not work on lock screen (it is a  separate bug). If you are stuck on lock screen and unable to enter the password because of the wrong layout, simply click the language indicator icon on the right of the password field.\n\nA: In Ubuntu 12.04 LTS, in the Keyboard Layout Options window I could select Key(s) to change layout and mark the binding of my choice. I use Shift + CapsLock to toggle the layout from the keyboard itself without having to use mouse cursor to select the required layout from the panel indicator. The same key combo seemed to work to serf through or select between multiple layouts. (But in Ubuntu 13.10 it wasn't so easy.)\n\n\nIn Ubuntu 13.10 \nIn the Keyboard settings window, under Shortcuts tab, I select Typing. The default for Switch to next source is Super+SPACE which didn't seem be working for me and so by clicking on it and I assigned a New Accelerator..., to change to next Layout (I used Super+L).\n(Then I assigned something similar for Switch to previous source using the same preferred layout, and then began to test them. Switching from the preferred layout to the alternate worked but the reverse did not. Please refer the next step for the fix.)\n\nThe Fix: After assigning Super+L for \"Switch to next source\" using my preferred layout (A), I changed my keyboard layout to the alternative layout (B) and then assigned the combination to \"Switch to previous source\" (for which I used Shift+Super+L). Then I tested them, and they work fine. (Maybe disabling \"Switch to previous source\" would work too.)\nThe new accelerators for the key combos that I used looks like this:\n\nI could then switch to layout (A) using Super+L and back to layout (B) using Shift+Super+L.\n\nA: Many thanks to William Hua (attente) for his Modifier-only input switch PPA.

Now I need to add a GUI so I can occasionally, at will (not every time) load a web browser to control a device.

I had an older laptop with ubuntu 13.04 (upgraded a few times) where I've installed xmonad. In xmonad I would get all the media keys bindings from ubuntu (including osd notifications). I'm not sure what it was, but perhaps it was gnome-settings-daemon that was taking care of it because there are entries in dconf for that.\nIn my new laptop I installed Xfce through a minimal iso, then compiled Xmonad. I tried to keep the same environment -- gnome-settings-daemon is run in .xinitrc as before and gsettings contains the same bindings. However, the key bindings do not work. What am I missing? I guess I could try to install the whole ubuntu-desktop but I have a small SSD so I'd like to avoid that.\nI know Xmonad can define its own custom handlers, but I'm having trouble with defining volume control actions and I figured it would be easier to just use what's out there already.\ntl;dr\nWhat executables/packages/config entries are necessary to get ubuntu/gnome keybindings work in another window manager? Can I get them to work without pulling in the whole ubuntu-desktop? I am running gnome-settings-daemon + the media-keys plugin is active in dconf, but the keys are not handled.\n\nA: It looks like GNOME removed the media key handling from gnome-settings-daemon and integrated it into gnome-shell:\nhttps://bbs.archlinux.org/viewtopic.php?pid=1262789\nI'm still looking for a good solution. Arch/Cinnamon people have apparently forked the 3.6 version.\n\nA: If you want to use dconf instead of xmonad controls, you should disable xmonad plugin (since it could cause interference) and then go down to the following path using the dconf-editor:\n org.gnome.settings-daemon.plugins.media-keys\n\nHere there are all the keys you need to configure your media actions. You should mark it as active in the first key so it works.\n\n\n", "Q: All Lines are Dotted! When using GIMP, and I select a pencil or a brush, all my lines are dotted!

You will see an icon on the desktop that says Install Ubuntu on your desktop. Launch (click on) it.\nWhen you get to the screen where it asks you if you want to replace an existing install or install next to it or Something Else, choose Something Else.\nNow you will see a screen that will let you see the hard drive you want to install to. Make sure you choose the correct drive you want to install ubuntu on! On that screen you will need to first delete any existing partitions so you can start fresh.\nStart at the bottom of the listed partitions and right click on each one and choose Delete. After you have done this to all the partitions, click on Apply.\nWhen you have deleted everything your drive will show as completely unallocated space! Sometimes some partitions cannot be deleted right away so delete all you can at first and click Apply, then start over from the bottom until they are all deleted.\nNow you want to create the necessary partitions for you to install Ubuntu.\nCreate the following partitions:\n\n*\n\n*a boot partition /boot and give it 250 MB of space, choose ext4 for the format.\n\n\n*a root partition /root and give it 15000 MB of space and ext4 format\n\n\n*a swap partition /swap and give it 4096 MB of space (it will format to swap)\n\n\n*a home partition /home and give it the rest of the space and format it to ext4.\nNow just finish the install and it will run beautifully.\n\nA: I figured I'd chime in because I've been reading these forum posts for days now. I realize my case was VERY rare but figured I'd post how I solved it. \nI couldn't get Ubuntu 16.04 or Ubuntu 18.04 to create a partition through installation, gpart or fdisk. I played with the bios many times swapping between legacy and EFI changing the error to The efi file system creation in partition #1 of ... failed. I even swapped hard-drives, both of which were new. I tried the above solution to no avail.\nAs a last resort I changed which port my the drive was plugged into on the mother-board. I realize this isn't most peoples issue, but it was mine. It was difficult to fix as the system detected the drive, it just made it write-protected on that port.\n\nA: For me,was using RAID Controller From BIOS, To erase Disk By Removing it from Array and Back it as I want. \n(you will erase your Disk)\n\nA: When the partitioning screen comes up, it asks me if I want to unmount the partitions, or continue as is. Choose \"unmount the partitions\". Then, on the next screen, delete each existing partition, and recreate them from scratch. Worked for me after that.

Then have a system restart. \nsomething like\nsudo mv ~/tecplot /opt/\n\nIf you are not root , then do as follows in your terminal \ngedit .bashrc\n\nwrite a line at the end of the opened text file as \nalias tec360=\"~/tp/bin/tec360\"\n\nThen save and close the text file.\nThen in the terminal write as \nsource ~/.bashrc\n\nnow try again by calling your program. \n", "Q: Equivalent to Windows' \"Disk Space Fan\"? I used this program a fair bit back in Windows.\n\nWhat's something vaguely equivalent?\n\nA: I think you are talking about disk usage analyzer which is already installed in your Ubuntu. \n\nA: There are several disk space analyzers in the Ubuntu repositories. Try several to see which you prefer. If you use Unity or GNOME, you'll probably want Baobab, or the others if you use KDE, because the programs' shortcuts will launch the corresponding desktop environment's file manager.\nBaobab\nA GNOME program. I think Baobab is installed by default.\n\nFilelight\nA KDE program.\n\nk4dirstat\nAnother KDE disk space analyzer.

Thank you! \n\nA: Load the necessary drivers required for CD Rom to run again (using the windows 7/XP that you received with the Notebook) & then try to install it again. \nHow to Load CD-Rom driver ?\nInsert the CD and press F6 (in case of XP) which will load the necessary drivers needed to run the CD-Rom and then try to install Ubuntu again.\nI suggest you first live boot the Ubuntu CD and then install it from there (using the icon present on the desktop in live session). \n", "Q: Different (merged) partitions on GParted when installing Ubuntu alongside Windows I've been trying to install Ubuntu 13.04 alongside my previous installation of Windows 8. Please note that my notebook is 4/5 years old and came with Windows 7 on it.\nIn Windows Disk Manager, I get 4 partitions:\n\n*\n\n*SYSTEM\n\n*C:\n\n*H: (DATA)\n\n*D: (which is the partition that I intend to use for Ubuntu)\n\nHowever, when I attempted to install Ubuntu in GParted, it said I have different partitions -- apparently H: and D: are merged in one single partition.\nI also tried the menu install option \"Install alongside Windows 8\", but the installer reboots and nothing happens.\nCould anyone help me solve this?\n\nA: It sounds like you tried to create a partition for Ubuntu using the Windows partitioning tool. This was a mistake, since the Windows partitioning tool converts from standard disk partitions to Microsoft's proprietary LDM/\"dynamic disk\" whenever the number of partitions exceeds four. Without more detailed information, I can't be 100% positive that this is what happened, but my hunch is that it was. Unfortunately, Microsoft provides no easy way to undo this change. I've heard that some third-party Windows tools, such as EaseUS Partition Master, can make this change, but I've never tried such tools.\n\nA: It would be more easy to understand if you can post a snapshot of it.\nI suggest you back up the data from H & D drives & during installation split the merged drive (H & D). And install Ubuntu in one of them using GParted.\n", "Q: Can Ubuntu be installed on systems without an internet connection? Is it possible to install Ubuntu on a system without any internet or wireless connections?\n\nA: You don't need internet to install any operating system. This is a caprice and can be useful to make some updates for the new system \"on the air\". But you can make this updates and after the system is installed. So, you don't have nothing to lose.\n\nA: In case of other Linux distributions like Debian you get a choice to download the file, which includes more than just the basic tools for a PC to run. But in case of Ubuntu you don't have that option. You get only Necessary basic tools, although they give you an option to update on the air during installation (you should be connected to Ethernet/LAN) to download the files.\nAnd yes, Ubuntu doesn't require Internet connection to run the installation. \n", "Q: Ubuntu 12.04 32 bit freezing What happens is, when I boot my computer, it loads the login screen just fine.

I have created WiFi hot spot via my Ubuntu laptop. And now I turned on WiFi in my Android mobile to access the internet but I'm  unable to view the hotspot that I had created via Ubuntu laptop.\nDid I do anything wrong? I want to access the internet on my Android mobile via Ubuntu laptop's WiFi. Is it possible?\n\nA: *\n\n*First of all you should make sure, that your wifi adapter supports infrastructure hotspots. If you used connectify on your windows system and it worked, skip this step.\n\n\nopen terminal and type: sudo lshw | less\nfind -network section and make sure that driver is ath5k or ath9k, this solution will only work for those drivers, but should fit the needs for the most laptop users.\n\n\n*\n\n*We now need to install 2 additional tools to make out hotspot, 1st one is hostapd(hotspot server), 2nd one is dnsmasq(dns dhcp server)\n\n\nin terminal type: sudo apt-get install hostapd dnsmasq\n\n\n*\n\n*stop those services if started already, and prevent them from starting on system start up.\n\n\nin terminal type:\nsudo service hostapd stop\nsudo service dnsmasq stop\nsudo update-rc.d hostapd disable\nsudo update-rc.d dnsmasq disable\n\n\n*\n\n*Now we need to set up config files.\nin terminal type: sudo gedit /etc/dnsmasq.conf\nor sudo kate /etc/dnsmasq.conf if you use kde\n\n\nadd those lines to the config file\nCode:\n # Bind to only one interface\n bind-interfaces\n # Choose interface for binding\n interface=wlan0\n # Specify range of IP addresses for DHCP leasses\n dhcp-range=192.168.150.2,192.168.150.10\n\n\n\n*\n\n*hostapd config\n\n\nin terminal type: sudo gedit /etc/hostapd.conf\nand add those lines\nCode:\n # Define interface\n interface=wlan0\n # Select driver\n driver=nl80211\n # Set access point name\n ssid=myhotspot\n # Set access point harware mode to 802.11g\n hw_mode=g\n # Set WIFI channel (can be easily changed)\n channel=6\n # Enable WPA2 only (1 for WPA, 2 for WPA2, 3 for WPA + WPA2)\n wpa=2\n wpa_passphrase=mypassword\n\nYou can change ssid name and password for anything you want here. Current config will create hotspot named myhotspot with mypassword password.\n\n\n*\n\n*Now create anywhere you want a file named start.sh\nedit it with any text editor like this:\n\n\nCode:\n #!/bin/bash\n # Start\n # Configure IP address for WLAN\n sudo ifconfig wlan0 192.168.150.1\n # Start DHCP/DNS server\n sudo service dnsmasq restart\n # Enable routing\n sudo sysctl net.ipv4.ip_forward=1\n # Enable NAT\n sudo iptables -t nat -A POSTROUTING -o ppp0 -j MASQUERADE\n # Run access point daemon\n sudo hostapd /etc/hostapd.conf\n # Stop\n # Disable NAT\n sudo iptables -D POSTROUTING -t nat -o ppp0 -j MASQUERADE\n # Disable routing\n sudo sysctl net.ipv4.ip_forward=0\n # Disable DHCP/DNS server\n sudo service dnsmasq stop\n sudo service hostapd stop\n\nYou will probably need to change ppp0 in this to eth0 (or any other number which refers to your wired connection.\n\n\n*\n\n*Last step. Now you can start your hotspot by starting our script. just run it using sudo sh\nfor me it looks like this sudo sh /home/ogyct/Desktop/start.sh because I have it on my desktop\n\n\nSource: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U59PymP-K6Y\n", "Q: Volume Control on HP DV6 not working after alsamixer Because pulse audio made the sound out of my laptop distort very very easily at even the lowest volumes, i removed it and installed gnome-alsa instead but then now, the volume control buttons on f9 and f10 aren't working at all.

So you have to decide who should be able to reboot/shutdown your system.\nBy default a local logged in user can reboot/shutdown the system, but when there are other sessions, for example an open SSH session and you try to reboot the system, you will be logged out instead. Then you have to set in entries org.freedesktop.consolekit.system.stop-multiple-users and org.freedesktop.consolekit.system.restart-multiple-users the value allow_active to yes: <allow_active>yes</allow_active>.\n\nA: The file\n/usr/share/polkit-1/actions/org.freedesktop.consolekit.policy\n\nwill be overwritten when policykit is updated.

By typing echo $0, I know I'm using tcsh in my Ubuntu 13.04 terminal.\nHowever no matter using chsh -s /bin/bash or just typing bash still can't make bash as my present shell. The interesting thing is that, if I type sh, then my shell will be sh. Finally I found a more interesting thing: each time after I typing bash, I type ps to see the change, I found I get two more lines: one is new bash PID, another is new tcsh PID, which means each time after I tried to use bash shell, system automatically change my shell back to tcsh immediately.\nHow can I solve this?

The crazy part is that there's no apparent difference between installations (.TGZ vs .DEB) - files inside folder looks to be the same (used file and md5sum commands to check).\nHere is the list of dependencies from the installed package: libatk1.0-0 (>= 1.12.4), libc6 (>= 2.4), libcairo2 (>= 1.2.4), libfontconfig1 (>= 2.8.0), libfreetype6 (>= 2.2.1), libgcc1 (>= 1:4.1.1), libgdk-pixbuf2.0-0 (>= 2.22.0), libglib2.0-0 (>= 2.12.0), libgtk2.0-0 (>= 2.24.0), libnspr4 (>= 1.8.0.10), libnss3 (>= 3.12.0~1.9b1), libpango1.0-0 (>= 1.14.0), libstdc++6 (>= 4.1.1), libx11-6, libxext6, libxrender1, libxt6, libcurl3-gnutls\nOne last thing is that I'd suggest to try to create a launcher for the game because I still have no success starting the game from bash.\n", "Q: Booting error on 12.04 When I'm booting Ubuntu 12.04 this error is showing:\nrender error detected, EIR: 0x00000010\npage table error\nPGTBL_ER: 0x00000100\n[drm:i915_report_and_clear_eir] *ERROR* EIR stuck: 0x00000010, masking\n\n\nA: See also this thread in Linuxquestions:\nhttp://www.linuxquestions.org/questions/debian-26/render-error-detected-eir-0x00000000-877013/\n", "Q: Refresh display settings - using xrandr / Laptop screen off, external screen on I set the display settings of my laptop so that when an external screen is plugged in, only the external screen is used. However, when I plug it in after being logged into Ubuntu, it stays as if no screen was plugged in. \nThat is not a big problem since the display settings refresh after I go into \"System Settings\" > \"Displays\".\nThat is kind of unhandy, so I would like to use the terminal to refresh the display settings. I guess it has something to do with an xrandr command. I tried xrandr --dryrun, this works but outputs a lot of stuff. It doesn't seem to be the right command.\nWhat is the correct command?\n\nA: You can use the following command:\nxrandr --auto && xrandr --output --left-of\n\nor\nxrandr --auto && xrandr --output --right-of\n\ndepending how your screen are arranged in System Settings → Displays.\nSee man xrandr for more info.\n\nA: For some reason the first answer did not work for me, but it brought me to to this command, which seems to do what I want:\nxrandr --auto && xrandr --output LVDS --off\n\nI will create an alias in the .bashrc.\n", "Q: How do you automatically rfkill unblock all on startup? I am an Ubuntu/Linux newbie, trying to overcome a range of issues, but eagerly learning a lot in the process. With help of this forum I was able to identify and solve the problem of getting my wireless to work. Basically I discovered that it would work if I replaced Network Manager with WICD, and then typed \"rfkill unblock all\" into the command terminal. This sets \"Hard blocked\" from yes to no, and then everything works great. I could still unblock the hard block when I had Network Manager but for some reason it still wouldn't work. Only with WICD would it work. So I'd recommend anyone struggling with getting their wireless to work to try WICD.\nMy problem is that the Hard block is set back to yes every time I restart my laptop. I do have a \"hard\" switch for the wireless, but it's a toggle key on the keyboard (Fn + F7), so its not really that \"hard\" actually. So every time Ubuntu starts up I have to open the command terminal again, type \"rfkill unblock all\" then open WICD and ask it to connect (even though it's set on connect automatically). I was wondering  if anyone could teach me how to make this process happen automatically on start up? Because of the intended use of this computer I have to restart often. Alternatively, is there anyone who would be interested to help me find the root of my problem? I.e. why the computer always boots up with the hard block set to yes?\nHopefully solving either of these would also cause WICD to automatically connect on start up too.\n\nA: You can add your command in the file /etc/rc.local (before the exit 0) or create a startup script and put it in /etc/init.d\n"]
