["Q: How do I access shared folders on Ubuntu server from Mac OS? I have an old dell desktop running ubuntu 11.04, I also have samba installed on it. I'm trying to access the shared folders on the Ubuntu machine from my Mac, so I go into 'Finder', click on 'Go' and 'Connect to Server'.\nI type in the ip address of the ubuntu machine smb://xxx.xxx.x.xx and click connect, I can then see the list of shared folders from the ubuntu machine so I know its making a connection. But when I access the 'Music' folder I get an error message stating:\nThere was an error connecting to the server \"xxx.xxx.x.xx\". Check the server name or IP address, and try again.\nAny thoughts anyone ?\nEDIT\nI have a external hard drive attached to the server, and the folders I'm trying to access are located on that external hard drive. \nThe location of the folder is /media/HD-CELU2/test, so I think the path from Finder should be smb://xxx.xxx.x.xx/media/HD-CELU2/test, but having tested this, I'm still not getting in.\nP.S. I'm using Samba as I have a Windows machine on my home network as well. \n\nA: I would go on the Mac to the net info then to machines and search for Ubuntu PC's name, copy that name, and use it instead of the IP address. In Finder do: Go -> Connect To and then smb://name/user or smb://` and type in your credentials.\nMake sure the samba server (your Ubuntu server) is configured correctly:\nType the following:\n sudo gedit /etc/samba/smb.conf\n\nRename MSHOME to WORKGROUP or whatever your workgroup's name is.\nThen go to the line where the security is defined and add ; at the beginning of the line. \nScroll to the bottom of the file and add/edit your shared folders as follows:\n[<folder_name>]\npath = /home/<user_name>/<folder_name>\navailable = yes\nvalid users = <user_name>\nread only = no\nbrowseable = yes\npublic = yes\nwritable = yes\n\nSave and restart samba with:\nsudo /etc/init.d/samba restart\n\nor\nsudo service smbd restart\n\ndepending on the version of Linux you're using.\nIf you haven't already done so, create a user with:\nsudo smbpasswd -a yourname\n\nNow go to the network settings and give your Server IP, subnet mask and gateway. You can then connect on the Mac as previously stated (Go -> Connect To -> smb://)\nOn the Linux box, you need to right-click whatever folder you want to share and go to Network Share or Properties and then click Sharing and click Share This Folder.\nTo test that your share is working correctly, type\ntestparm\n\nand you'll see output similar to the following:\nLoad smb config files from /etc/samba/smb.conf\nrlimit_max: increasing rlimit_max (1024) to minimum Windows limit (16384)\nProcessing section \"[printers]\"\nProcessing section \"[print$]\"\nProcessing section \"[<folder_name>]\"\nLoaded services file OK.\nServer role: ROLE_STANDALONE\n\nLifted from instructions here and originally found here. \nThis worked on MacOS Sierra Version 10.12.\n\nA: I suggest that you use sshfs. You need to have a ssh server (ssh-server package) and the sshfs package installed your Ubuntu server and a ssh client installed on your Mac.\nsshfs on Ubuntu Server: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/SSHFS \nssh on Mac OS X: http://www.panix.com/help/sw.macosx-ssh.html\nThen on your Mac, go to Finder --> Connect to server. Enter the ip address of the server and the port number on which the ssh server is listening (default 22), your username and password of your account on the Ubuntu server and the folder to access (/media/HD-CELU2/test).\nOnce you are connected, I suggest that you setup a ssh key-pair between your Mac and your Ubuntu server, so that you do not need to enter your username or password next time that you connect.\n\nA: Click the Desktop go to Go → Network (Command + Shift + K if it's not there, it's months since I've used a Mac!), the Mac will then hunt down all network shares on the LAN.\nIf that doesn't pick it up try smb://hostname where hostname is the name of the sharing computer. I don't know why, but typing smb://ipaddress has never worked for me on any OS.\n", "Q: What network mapping tools are available? What network mapping tools are available? \n\nA: Found the same question at linuxquestions.org. So maybe that could help.\nExcerpts from the link:\nQuestion: Does anyone know of any network mapping tools for Linux (Ubuntu 8.04) similar to The Dude?\nAnswers:\n\n1. There are several things that might do what you want (I have no\n  knowledge of 'The Dude' apart from the link that you posted, so I've\n  assumed anything that does network mapping might be what you want and\n  posted a few from the first few pages on sourceforge):\n  \n  \n*\n  \n*Nagios/Nagvis\n  \n*Mila_Ajax_Map \n  \n*Safe Mapping and Reporting Tool (SMART)\n  \n*Network Scaner \n  \n*NMap Console\n  \n*Oggle Network Mapping and Display Tool\n  \n*Prime \n  \n*CartoReso \n  \n*OpenMapper \n  \n*OSPF network visualizer\n  \n*netfuse \n  \n*Ajax Network Map \n  \n*Network Administration Visualized \n  \n*Advanced Network Topology and Inventory (?) ...\nIf, however, you want an easy life, you should probably check out the\n  packages that your distro offers.

Lanmap is similar to The Dude; it creates a graphical layout of\n  your network.\n\nAlso after a little bit of Googling found that lanmap has been abandoned but there is a lanmap2. \n", "Q: Record a program's output with PulseAudio I would like to record an output of a program with PulseAudio using command line/bash script. It is important not to record all output, but only the output from one specific program.\nI thought I would have to create a new null-sink and than move the program's output to this new sink. Than tell parec to use this specific monitor to record.\nThe first step would be something like this:\npactl load-module module-null-sink sink_name=steam\n\nBut how to move the program's output now to this sink?\nAnd how to record the specific sink with a bash script?\n\nA: Improving KrisWebDev's answer further, if you want record-n-play to always be available, first find out the default output:\npacmd list-sinks | grep -A1 \"* index\" | grep -oP \"<\\K[^ >]+\"\n\nwhich will output something like:\nalsa_output.pci-0000_00_1b.0.analog-stereo\n\nNext, create a file ~/.config/pulse/default.pa:\n.include /etc/pulse/default.pa\n\nload-module module-combine-sink sink_name=record-n-play slaves=alsa_output.pci-0000_00_1b.0.analog-stereo sink_properties=device.description=\"Record-and-Play\"\n\nPlease replace alsa_output.pci-0000_00_1b.0.analog-stereo with whatever output you got from the pacmd command. Pulse does not read the default config file when a custom config file exists - that's why the first line above includes the default config file. That way pulseaudio still loads the default config first.\nRun pulseaudio -k to kill the current pulseaudio instance so a new one is started with the new configuration.\nIf at any time you want to undo the changes here, just remove the ~/.config/pulse/default.pa file and run pulseaudio -k.\nIf you want the record-n-play to be the default sink for all outputs, you can do that by adding yet another line to the end of ~/.config/pulse/default.pa:\nset-default-sink record-n-play\n\nFor programs that pulseaudio already has stored information on, it remembers whatever output device they used last, so you'll have to manually reconfigure those using one of the methods described in KrisWebDev's answer.\n\nA: Try something like this:\nIn a terminal enter\npacmd\n\n(this is the CLI of the PulseAudio-Server)\nthen use\nlist-sink-inputs\n\n(where you get the indices of the running inputs)\nNow find the index of your input. Now referred to as $INDEX\nthe scriptable part is:\npactl load-module module-null-sink sink_name=steam\npactl move-sink-input $INDEX steam\nparec -d steam.monitor | oggenc -b 192 -o steam.ogg --raw -\n\nExplanations:\n\n\n*\n\n*The first command will add a null-sink as you already knew.\n\n*The second command moves the sink-input from your standard-audio-sink to steam\n\n*The third command records the monitor of the device steam (-d) and puts the output (raw-wave-stream) into oggenc, which encodes this wave-stream to an oga-file. (for mp3 use lame)\n\n\nA: I've created this bash script based on the answers provided by @Waschtl and @KrisWebDev answers.\nAvailable here:\nhttps://gist.github.com/ramast/4be3314bc73f28f55e3604497188b007\nHow to use?\n$ ./pulse-recorder.bash \n    index: 225\n                application.name = \"ALSA plug-in [mplayer]\"\n                module-stream-restore.id = \"sink-input-by-application-name:ALSA plug-in [mplayer]\"\nChoose recording index: 225\ntemp.mp3 file already exist, replace (y/n)? y\n\nNew version\nI've created a python script that offer some improvements over the old one.\nhttps://gist.github.com/ramast/c47bd5e57586e9c2deb74975e27089f0\nHow to use?\n$ ./pulse-recorder.py \n\n1 - ALSA plug-in [mplayer]\n2 - AudioIPC Server\n\nPlease enter a number: 1\n\nYour selection was: ALSA plug-in [mplayer]\nPlease press enter when you are ready to start\n\nWhen you press enter the recording will start immediately. if by the time you hit enter the application was already stopped (i.e you closed mplayer for example) the script will wait until the app appear again and start recording.\nThe only draw back to that script (vs original one) is that if the list contain two entries with same name, the script won't behave correctly.\nFor example\n$ ./pulse-recorder.py                                                                                                      \n\n1 - ALSA plug-in [mplayer]\n2 - ALSA plug-in [mplayer]\n\nEdit: This is an improved version of the script by @anarcat\nUsage:\nTo produce ogg recording\n./pulse-recorder.py -i -o 'test.ogg'\nTo produce mp3 recording\n./pulse-recorder.py -i --encoder \"lame -r -q 3 --lowpass 17 --abr 192  - '%s'\"   -o 'test.mp3'\n\nA: If a single program is outputting sound you can use this bash one-liner:\nparec --monitor-stream  $(pacmd list-sink-inputs|tac|perl -E'undef$/;$_=<>;/RUNNING.*?index: (\\d+)\\n/s;say $1') --format=s16le --channels=2 --file-format=aiff newrecording.aiff\n\nOutput seems to be about 10MB per minute, and don't mute the program!\nI believe this to be a good solution as I don't download a new script, and I don't have to create a new null sink in pulseaudio.  It should give odd results if the program has no audio-output when the one-liner starts, or if multiple programs are outputting audio when the command starts.\nparec should stop recording when you are done with the application that's playing audio.  Some editing applications might have trouble with a aiff file that's 600 minutes long though, if they try and load it into RAM twice.\nThis is also a poor solution if the application stops and starts outputting audio.\n\nA: Improving Waschtl answer of this thread so you can BOTH LISTEN AND RECORD the app sound:\nFirst, we look for our default output and put its sink name in $DEFAULT_OUTPUT:\n$ pacmd list-sinks | grep -A1 \"* index\"\n  * index: 1\n    name: <alsa_output.pci-0000_00_1b.0.analog-stereo>\n$ DEFAULT_OUTPUT=$(pacmd list-sinks | grep -A1 \"* index\" | grep -oP \"<\\K[^ >]+\")\n$ echo $DEFAULT_OUTPUT\nalsa_output.pci-0000_00_1b.0.analog-stereo\n\nThen, we create a combined sink that has only one slave: $DEFAULT_OUTPUT. The sound generated by the app (source) will be forwarded to the slave sink (ie. real output), and we'll also record it.  It is different than a null sink where the source sound is not forwarded.\n$ pactl load-module module-combine-sink \\\n  sink_name=record-n-play slaves=$DEFAULT_OUTPUT \\\n  sink_properties=device.description=\"Record-and-Play\"\n\nsink_properties is optional and may bug if you use spaces in the description name.\nThen, we could use pactl move-sink-input ... command of Waschtl answer (with record-n-play instead of steam) but GUI pavucontrol is more simple (and great for checking/troubleshooting):\n$ sudo apt-get install pavucontrol\n$ pavucontrol &\n\nThen, we play some sound in the app we want to record. In pavucontrol Playback tab, we select in the app dropdown list: \"Record-and-Play\".\nFinally, we're good to record and listen at the same time! (lame mp3 example, run in foreground)\n$ parec --format=s16le -d record-n-play.monitor | \\\n  lame -r --quiet -q 3 --lowpass 17 --abr 192 - \"temp.mp3\"\n\nOr we can record in background and stop at any time:\n$ parec --format=s16le -d record-n-play.monitor | \\\n  lame -r --quiet -q 3 --lowpass 17 --abr 192 - \"temp.mp3\" \\\n   > /dev/null &1>/dev/null\n$ killall -q parec lame\n\nNB:\n\n\n*\n\n*To unmess everything or retry the procedure: Delete or reset the sinks by using this answer. pulseaudio -k works great to reset everything to session's defaults.\n\n*If we change the default output in the System Sound Settings, the custom app Playback setting will be overwritten and we will have to go back in pavucontrol to set it back to the combined interface.\n\n*To be able to listen to the sound from several \"real\" interfaces (eg headphones, HDMI output, etc...), we should include all \"real\" outputs that we may use to listen, as record-n-play slink slaves, like: pactl load-module module-combine-sink sink_name=record-n-play slaves=real-output-1,real-output-2.\n\n\nEDIT: Beware, since Ubuntu 18 (maybe 17 too), the combined sink tends to become the default system output device, instead of the real output device. So when you change the volume using the sound icon in the system tray it impacts your record sound. Workaround: After creating the combined sink, open pavucontrol in Output tab. Select \"View: Virtual Output Devices\" and reset the sound volume of the combined sink to 100%. Then select \"View: Hardware Output Devices\" and press the green icon \"Define as alternative\" on the real output device.\n\nA: All these answers are amazing and demonstrate the power of PulseAudio !\nDigging-in to try to understand them I found a simpler solution (maybe it's a new feature) : we can directly tap into the default output's monitor.\nDEFAULT_OUTPUT=$(pacmd list-sinks | grep -A1 \"* index\" | grep -oP \"<\\K[^ >]+\")  # From previous answer\nffmpeg -f pulse -ac 2 -i $DEFAULT_OUTPUT.monitor output.mp3\n\nWorks great if you want to capture video as well.\n\nA: @Waschtl's answer is fantastic. @ixtmixilix asked about restoring regular audio after the recording is finished. Here's the easiest way I know of:\nInstall and run the pavucontrol GUI. You should see your audio-outputting application and it's volume meter under the Playback tab in there. There will be a button next to it showing that it's playing on Null Output. Click on that and change it to your ordinary audio output, Built-in Audio Analog Stereo in my case.\nHere's a screenshot of what you're looking for: \n\nYou can also use this approach to set up your recording in the future, after you've run the load-module command in @Waschtl's answer to create the sink.\n\nA: One small improvement to solutions here. First, the problem: you may need to adjust the volume of the playback (monitor) of the application while listening to other audio, but not the recording volume. The module-null-sink works if no output is desired, but what if some is needed or this needs to be controlled on-the-fly?\nThe problem is that PulseAudio does not allow separate adjustment of a single \"slave\" or output separately from the sink volume. In other words, you could adjust the application (which will affect everything below in the chain, so that's not good) or the sink the application has been connected to, but the end result in both cases is that playback and recording volume will both be affected - regardless if the recording software connects to the application or the sink.\nOne solution is: we need to add at least one more sink to the chain.\nA solution:\nSLAVE_FOR_PLAYBACK=alsa_output.pci-0000_2f_00.4.iec958-stereo\nVOLCTRL_SINK_NAME=rec-mon-vol\nRECMON_SINK_NAME=rec-n-play\n\npacmd load-module module-combine-sink sink_name=$VOLCTRL_SINK_NAME slaves=$SLAVE_FOR_PLAYBACK sink_properties=device.description=\"Recording-Monitor-Volume\" \npacmd load-module module-combine-sink sink_name=$RECMON_SINK_NAME  slaves=$VOLCTRL_SINK_NAME sink_properties=device.description=\"Record-and-Monitor\"\n\nSolution here is obvious: by adding one more sink into chain to allow decreasing volume after the recording step without affecting recording. I.e. a simple diagram for the above setup:\nAPP -> REC -> MON -> MASTER_SINK (speakers)\n         (\\--->recording software)\n\nThis way we can adjust playback volume at MON separately from volume incoming to REC and other applications (music, voice chat etc.) connected to MASTER_SINK (=speakers).\nAlternative solution:\nBut in case REC volume has been decreased and one wants to increase it at MON, some bitdepth will be lost (if I guess correctly how PulseAudio works). Another (perhaps more elegant solution?) would hence be:\nAPP -> REC_AND_MONITOR ---> REC (---> recording software)\n                       \\--> MONITOR -> MASTER_SINK (speakers)\n\nBut this requires a third sink. But now both recording and playback volume can be genuinely adjusted separately without affecting each other (the first solution works nicely only if the volume needs to be decreased only). Like so:\npactl load-module module-null-sink    sink_name=rec_monitor   sink_properties=device.description=\"Recording_monitor_volume\"\npactl load-module module-null-sink    sink_name=rec           sink_properties=device.description=\"Record_with_no_monitoring\"\npactl load-module module-combine-sink sink_name=rec-n-monitor sink_properties=device.description=\"Record_with_monitoring\" slaves=rec,rec_monitor\npactl load-module module-loopback source=rec_monitor.monitor sink=${SLAVE_FOR_PLAYBACK} latency_msec=${DESIRED_LATENCY}\n\nNow connect your applications output to rec-n-monitor, recording software with rec and can adjust volume of monitor by adjusting rec_monitor and recording volume by adjusting rec.\nFor monitor latency, set DESIRED_LATENCY for whatever you want. I use 20 (unit is ms). Of course, it depends on your system what the actual latency will be; also see pactl man page. There are other general tricks for lowering Pulseaudio latency, but that is out of scope for this question...\n", "Q: Weird viewing in Citrix Receiver (ATI card) In a Ubuntu Natty desktop PC I connect to a MS Windows machine via Citrix Receiver, sometimes window looks weird (has blank areas, yo have to switch to another window outside citrix and come back to see it right).

I tried do used xev in terminal and get keycode for .Xmodmap file but can't take code of right Win. Just always open system menu of ubuntu. How I can do it?\n\nA: This should be do-able using xmodmap.\nFirst, find the keycode for your Win-key: Enter terminal using Ctrl+Alt+T, and type xev.

How this can be done has been answered here.\nOnce you obtain the keycode, say xxx, execute in terminal\nxmodmap -e \"keycode xxx = Menu\"\n\nThis should map you Win-key to Menu. You can test it using e.g. xev again: a little after the keycode, it should now write something like (keysym 0xff67, Menu).\nTo automate setting it on startup, see e.g. this.\n\nA: If you haven't tried the keyboard preference mapping under Gnome, you should give it a look.

(I'm aware of the Gnome Classic option in 11.04) Since I'm using a LTS version, rest assured I will be receiving updates to Ubuntu until April 2013.\nSo my question is what am I missing by using an LTS? What kind of updates LTS version receives compared to the normal release? Are they just security updates?\n\nA: Machines more suitable to long term support releases will generally be business machines (such as web-servers in datacentre's or servers in a workplace).  These machines it would be generally disruptive to be upgrading the operating system every 6 months as opposed to every 3 years!  When it is essential to keep the downtime to a minimum, time is money!\nGenerally a long term support distribution will have constant security fixes and the like to keep the system stable, but no MAJOR application changes.  A lot of the time for a fileserver sitting in an office with no screen won't benefit from that new version of firefox or that extra wallpaper.\nIn your situation, if you want the latest software, stick to recent ubuntu releases.  The fact that you're not a fan of unity doesn't mean you have to use an older version of ubuntu as you are fully aware.  When you first get to the login screen after installation, change the drop box at the bottom of the screen to ubuntu classic.  This will ensure you've got the latest software, security fixes, efficiency fixes, and a few extra toys to play with that have come out of that extra year's worth of development!\nI do find it  unimaginably odd that even though you know about that feature you'd rather use an LTS verison.  LTS suuport lasts for 3 years on a desktop and 5 years on a server, wheras it's normally 18 months for standard release.  This means that both 11.04 will \"expire\" after ubuntu 12.10 and ubuntu 10.04 LTS will \"expire\" after ubuntu 13.04 respectively. \nSo for you, an extra 6 months worth of life on the more \"stable\" operating system?\nOr cutting edge?\nEnjoy your Ubuntu!\nEDIT:\nHere's a link for anyone else reading this showing you how to switch to classic desktop after installation:\nNixie Pixel - Change back to the Classic Gnome look\n\nA: The two thing you might be missing is new hardware support and newer software like Firefox 6. The latter can be dealt with by manually updating the most used applications from PPAs, while the former is more more difficult - you need to upgrade the kernel. All in all, if the computer you use is not new, 10.04 is a very good release to stick with.\n", "Q: UDP tuning ubuntu - how to? I'm having some lags with my server running Ubuntu 10.04 on my UDP packets. What should I do to change the settings set for the UDP packets? I think the problem is there.\nOn my /proc/sys/net/ipv4/udp_mem I have 137088   182784  274176\nudp_rmem_min: 4096\nudp_wmem_min: 4096\n\n/proc/sys/net/core/rmem_max  - 131071\n/proc/sys/net/core/rmem_default  - 124928\n\n/proc/sys/net/core/wmem_max  - 131071\n/proc/sys/net/core/wmem_default  - 124928\n\nI'm sending 30 packets every second from the client to the server and from the server to the client. They are all coming in a delay when there are a lot of users connected. \n\nA: Your problem is not related to UDP directly. The problem is that one of your cores is maxed and some application involved in your use of UDP cannot take advantage of more than one core. Your choices are to profile/optimize it to get it to do its job with the resources available or to redesign it to use multiple threads or multiple processes so that it can take advantage of the other cores.\nExactly how you do this depends on what's wrong with the code now. One possibility is if the code looks roughly like this:\nwhile(1)\n{\n do_udp_stuff(); // this is fairly simple\n do_other_stuff(); // this is complex\n}\n\nIn this case, the solution is either to optimize the do_other_stuff or move it to a different thread.\nAnother possibility is if the code looks like this:\nwhile(1)\n{\n do_some_work_which_generates_a_UDP_Packet();\n send_udp_patch();\n}\n// or\nwhile(1)\n{\n receive_UDP_packet();\n process_UDP_packet();\n}\n\nIn this case, the solution may be to have more than one thread doing the work that generates the UDP packet or processing the UDP packet.\nBasically, you either have to reduce the amount of CPU you use per UDP packet or you need to increase your CPU utilization efficiency by distributing the work over the cores.\n", "Q: Why do a lot of programs crash in segmentation fault? For a few days, a lot of programs do not launch properly. This includes Skype, Oracle VM Virtualbox, Scilab, Boinc, LÖVE, OMG! Words! and a little Java program I downloaded from the web (RemoteDroid). When I launch them from the terminal, I get the same error: Segmentation fault.\nI cannot figure out which is the recent change I made on my computer that is the origin of those errors; is it because I changed my keyboard-layout? Or because I installed a lot of programs for developers?\nNotice that it is a general problem, not for just one only application. Moreover, since the two first are closed source, I will not be able to compile them.\n\nA: Either you recently upgraded a library that the programs share to a new, buggy version, or you have developed a hardware problem, such as overheating.\n", "Q: Choppy video with HD--is there an easy way to downsample or lower the quality so that my videos will play correctly? I have a somewhat older computer, and it's fine with most things, but on super high-res video it's choppy and the CPU's at 100%. Should I downsample these videos, or is there a setting that I can use to make them play without stopping? \n\nA: You have to downsample them before playing them. (Might take a few hours and you loose quality.)\nThe hard work is really decoding the video and not displaying it. That means no matter if you display a lower resolution video, the work is all the same.\n", "Q: Gnome Shell theme displays orange title bars I've upgraded from 11.04 to 11.10 beta and installed Gnome Shell and logged on with the Gnome Shell session. My window title bars are orange like this: \n\nAny way to fix?\n\nA: You need to install gnome-tweak-tool and gnome-themes-standard, then use gnome-tweak-tool to change your window border theme to something supported by mutter (such as Adwaita).\nIf it does not apply immediately, log on and log back in. Also ensure you've installed all the updates.\n", "Q: What files can I delete to avoid repeating the Python libraries? I installed SAGE mathematics from binary because there was no package for it in synaptic. From reading on the web I learned that SAGE brings its own python libraries rather than using the ones Ubuntu / synaptic has already installed.\nI'm getting low on hard disk space -- what can/should I delete? Or how should I rejigger my libraries / system to avoid duplicating (gigabytes) worth of libraries?\nBTW, I'm having a similar problem with texlive-full -- I first downloaded the package in synaptic, then realised it was outdated, then downloaded the iso -- and now I think I have three or four copies of LaTeX on my drive.\n\nA: This is one of the downsides of installing software from outside of the standard repositories. For most people, it isn't a big problem, but for you it appears to be an issue due to disk space.\nThe apps you've downloaded use their own versions of various libraries and software components, and have been tested to work with those components. Removing them will likely cause those programs to be unstable or stop working. \nIt sounds like you would be safe to remove the texlive-related packages that you've installed via your package manager. That will free up some disk space, as texlive packages are pretty large.\nI would recommend:\nsudo apt-get remove texlive* && sudo apt-get autoremove && sudo apt-get clean\n\nThat will remove the texlive packages you installed, remove any dependencies that are no longer needed, and then clear your cache of packages you previously installed.\nAs another commenter suggested, though, you might want to consider a backup drive, or (if you can afford it) even a new, larger hard drive. Hard drives are not so expensive these days.\n", "Q: Not able to install Ldapclient on a non-internet connected PC For past couple of days am trying to install ldapclient in ubuntu 10.10, but no luck.\nCan anyone point me to the exact packages i need to download and install, i have tried the same so may times but failed, so please help.\nOne important thing is that i dont have any internet connection to this desktop because of security reasons, so i need to download those packages and install manually.\n\nA: If this guide is correct, you need to install these: libpam-ldap; libnss-ldap; nss-updatedb; libnss-db; nscd; ldap-utils\nTo download them and their dependencies, use APT-Web. Select your Ubuntu version, then your distro. After that, paste this into the packages input field: libpam-ldap; libnss-ldap; nss-updatedb; libnss-db; nscd; ldap-utils Click submit. It will display what packages need to be downloaded. Download them and use some media to get them to the machine that isn't connected to the internet. Then just use dpkg to install them. dpkg -i * will install all packages in the current directory. \n\nA: Along with all of these you would definitely need libldap. libldap-2.4.2 is the most recent one if I'm  not mistaken. Installing libpam-ldap, libnss-ldap and libkrb53 (for Kerberos related authentication). The package ldap-auth-config should help you in setting up the ldap configuration. \nAll these .deb files can be installed individually using 'dpkg --install'. Use the 'force-depends' parameter to ignore dependencies so that you don't have to strictly follow a chronological order to install the packages. 'ldap-utils' will give you utilities like ldapsearch that will help you determine whether ldap is functioning properly. Use 'ldapsearch -x' to ensure that LDAP client can bind to the ldap master server.\n", "Q: How to have a OpenLDAP Multi master replication setup? This is the setup I would like to have.\n               LDAP clients\n                     |\n     ________________|________________\n    /                                 \\\n   |___________LoadBalancer1___________|\n      |              |             |\n      |              |             |\n ldapserver1    ldapserver2   ldapserver3\n\nMy challenge is I never did this kind of architecture before, So would like to know from LB prospective, How to configure  it like  say i have to create a DNS FQDN e.g \"ldapserver.example.com\" and then use this as a floating IP/hostname for the 3 LDAP servers in the backend? Or what should be done? The network team will do the setup but I need to tell them what to do.  I would also like to configure LDAPS, so how to create the certificate i mean what to provide in common name or how to create a certificate which can be shared across the servers, am using openssl ? The setup wiould be a Multi-Master replication.\n\nA: It depends what tool they will use to do the load-balancing. If they are using BIND for your DNS you could use SRV records and OpenLDAP is one of the few applications that supports it. The attached link will give you greater info, but basically you need to determine a priority value along with a weighting value as well. You basically need to determine how even of a load that you want across the systems and set your values as such. \nFor the LDAPS certificate you may run into issues if it validates the CN, which in your case would be ldapserver.example.com on all three hosts. If it resolves the locat hostname to the cert it may not work. \nBIND SRV Record Type for Load Balancing\n", "Q: Fix $PATH to work with SSH I'm running Ubuntu 11.04. \nSuddenly my server stopped to recognize any commands:\nssh lisv22@chusmix.com\nPassword: \n-bash-3.2$ sudo\n-bash: sudo: command not found\n\nI think this has to due with a problem with $PATH:\n-bash-3.2$ echo $PATH\n/usr/kerberos/bin:/usr/local/bin:/bin:/usr/bin\n\nHow can I fix this issue to make commands work again in SSH?\nAlso is this a problem with my server or my system? If I install Debian and try again from there will I be able to run commands? Any info about the issue will be accepted. Thanks\n\nA: That is an odd $PATH - normally you'd have (at least) /usr/sbin and /sbin in there as well.  Is there something special about the remote system?\nThe problem would appear to be on your server, though.  When you ssh to a machine like that you're essentially running a full login on that system, just as if you had sat down at the machine and logged in to a VT.  There's not a lot of scope for local changes to mess that up, at least not in the way that you're seeing.\nWhat were you doing on the server prior to this problem appearing?  What changes did you make?  The sudo binary would usually be in /usr/bin, which is in your $PATH; is sudo actually still installed?\n", "Q: Use certain values for X and Y axis in Calc I'd like to create a chart with the wavelength as X-values and the corresponding voltage as Y-Values.

How do I completely remove ekiga via sudo apt-get remove --purge seems to leave some information when i re-install ekiga. can i rm -rvf even tho ekiga is not just in the home file but in the gconf>apps file?\nThe reason is that I had added two profiles (A & B) but after trying remove --purge the other profile (B) is still there but not visible from computer 1... I installed ekiga on another ubuntu computer 2 with (B) profile. When I try message (B) from computer 1 it goes nowhere because it apparently is sending it to profile (A) on computer 1. However sending from comp 2 with profile (B) to comp 1 and profile (A) it goes through.  So it is apparent comp 1 has profiles (A) and (B) even after remove --purge.\n\nA: apt-get purge won't get rid of local configuration files.\nekiga creates files in your home directory, under\n./.gconf/apps/ekiga\nYou'll have to delete that entire directory with rm -rf ~/.gconf/apps/ekiga \nApplications frequently use .gconf, .gnome*, .config and .local for various settings and cache information, so those are good places to check in general.\nIf you're not finding more pieces of ekiga, try running sudo updatedb and when that finishes, try locate ekiga .  You might find something you've missed. \nFrom the additional items, you've added, I don't see any problems.  If you really wanted to you could delete some of those items with something like sudo rm /usr/lib/pymodules/python2.7/orca/scripts/apps/ekiga/script.pyc .  I wouldn't expect these to make a difference, unless you're using orca. \n", "Q: Letters choppy on Google Earth I installed Google Earth and it is basically working, but the letters are choppy.\nWhy are the letters choppy?\n\n\nA: I had the same problem when I first installed Google Earth, but it was at about the same time as I installed Ubuntu 11.04.  So I installed fonts from the Ubuntu Software Center, including and especially the installer for the Microsoft TrueType fonts.  The next time I restarted the computer, it worked just fine.  I can't tell you exactly which font worked, but it seems that one of them did.\n\nA: I think this post has your answer!\nAnyway, just to reiterate, open up your terminal, by using your dash search, then copy-paste the following: \nsudo apt-get install qt4-qtconfig\n\nYou should need to enter your password. When its done installing, type in\nqtconfig\n\nGo to \"Fonts\" tab.\nGo to \"Point Size\".\nClick on the dropdown menu. \nChange \"9\" for \"14\".

Once you have edited this file you will need to restart the service.\nlocalhost:30888/__index will also get you directly to configuration if you are on the system that has TV Mobili installed. \nIf you are on a different computer to the one you installed TV Mobili onto you can access your installation through the following page.

I'm running ubuntu 11.10 and I was wondering if somebody knows how to modify the timeout in gtk3 for the small \"filter\" box that appears when you start typing in a list / nautilus folder (in 2.x it stays up a lot, in 3.0 it acts more like kde in the way that you can almost only have 1 letter a a time).\nUpdate\nIt's working nicely since the final release.\n\nA: You'll need to compile your own changes into nautilus as I believe the functionality is hard coded (most things in nautilus are). I don't think you will be able to use a previous version either, you might have to modify the recent version and reverse the specific changes.\nOf course no one is going to know what the exact changes are, that requires a lot of code investigation.\n", "Q: When is network-manager-openvpn going to be updated to the 0.9 version? Since bug 274930 implemented added functionalities in Network Manager regarding OpenVPN, the network-manager-openvpn plugin needs to be updated to 0.9 version to benefit from those improvements.\nAt the moment, with the 0.899 version it is impossible to connect to a openvpn server; the following is generated in the syslog file:\nSep 11 09:25:38 abc NetworkManager[1594]: <info> Starting VPN service 'openvpn'...\nSep 11 09:25:38 abc NetworkManager[1594]: <info> VPN service 'openvpn' started (org.freedesktop.NetworkManager.openvpn), PID 5083\nSep 11 09:25:38 abc NetworkManager[1594]: <info> VPN service 'openvpn' appeared; activating connections\nSep 11 09:25:38 abc NetworkManager[1594]: <info> VPN plugin state changed: 1\nSep 11 09:25:38 abc NetworkManager[1594]: <info> VPN plugin state changed: 3\nSep 11 09:25:38 abc NetworkManager[1594]: <info> VPN connection 'XYZ' (Connect) reply received.\nSep 11 09:25:38 abc NetworkManager[1594]: <warn> VPN connection 'XYZ' failed to connect: 'property 'user-name' invalid or not supported'.\nSep 11 09:25:38 abc NetworkManager[1594]: <warn> error disconnecting VPN: Could not process the request because no VPN connection was active.\nSep 11 09:25:38 abc NetworkManager[1594]: <info> Policy set 'Auto eth0' (eth0) as default for IPv4 routing and DNS.\nSep 11 09:25:43 abc NetworkManager[1594]: <info> VPN service 'openvpn' disappeared\n\nWhen will it be updated?\n\nA: Assuming there are no last minute regressions, these package ARE v0.9.\nAs you can see from the change-logs (at the time of writing this), release candidate 2 is being used from upstream.\nIt is usual for the developers and maintainers to use either the full release-candidate versions from upstream - or to cherry pick certain bugfixes and merge this in.  In this case, the maintainers are using the release-candidate version + some alternate compile options.\nSo - as to your issue - I would strongly recommend you file a bug-report on launchpad to help the maintainers find a solution before v0.9 is fully committed.\n", "Q: Any accounting Software especially coded for ubuntu Are there any accounting application/software(medium to large scale enterprise level) especially coded for ubuntu.\n\nA: Yes there is ADempiere.

Googling suggests that DTrace is available on Linux but I can't find instructions as how to install it.\n\nDTrace is a comprehensive dynamic tracing framework. It is designed to give operational insights that allow users to tune and troubleshoot applications and the OS itself. Special consideration has been taken to make it safe to use in a production environment. For example, there is minimal probe effect when tracing is underway, and no performance impact associated with any disabled probe; this is important since there are tens of thousands of DTrace probes that can be enabled.\n\n\nA: 1\nI found the sytemtap-sdt-dev package.

But I haven't tested it and wouldn't recommend it.

I'm mainly interested in good-looking transitions between images and videos.\n\nA: kdenlive \n\nKdenlive is a free open-source video editor for GNU/Linux and FreeBSD, which supports DV, AVCHD and HDV editing. Kdenlive relies on several other open source projects, such as FFmpeg, the MLT video framework and Frei0r effects.\n\n\nKdenlive is easily the best video editor currently available for Ubuntu. There is also a GTK frontend for MLT framework (OpenShot) but it has less features and worse user interface.\nKdenlive supports a wide array of video formats, images and transitions. The rendering tool has ready presets for most situations like Youtube, DVD, different mobile devices, etc. so you don't need to be an expert on video compression. \nYou can get it from Ubuntu's repository, but I'd suggest you get the latest version from project site. They even have a repository set up for Ubuntu.\n\nA: 2020 update:\nOlive Video Editor\nI think now the best option (even being on alpha) is Olive, IMO better than the alternatives.\nMaybe a downside is that Olive targets professional users.\n\nShotcut\nMore general purpose.\n\nOpenShot\nGreat video editor without need to install all the KDE stuff.\n\nOpenShot Video Editor is a free, open-source video editor for Linux, Mac, and Windows licensed under the GPL version 3.0.\nFeatures\nOpenShot has many great features, such as trimming and arranging videos, adjusting audio levels, transitions between videos, compositing multiple layers of video, chroma-key / green screen effect, and support of most formats and codecs.\nWhat really sets OpenShot apart from other video editors is the easy-to-use user interface.

I'm looking for an IDE which helps me reduce my Alt-Tabbing. At any given time, I've got a Chromium session open (for testing my application), a gedit/geany session for editing, and a dedicated terminal for git etc.\nI remember that there was something like this in Visual Studio and Expression Studio. I've been through Komodo Editor, Eclipse, Bluefish, Anjuta but it seems that none of them have an integrated browser. Also I do not like the inbuilt terminal of geany (can never seem to restart it after a misplaced Ctrl+D.\nJust to be clear, I do not want a HTML preview mode (offered by Bluefish for eg) which allows me to preview my HTML. I need a full-fledged browser (with JS,DOM support) embedded in tabs. \nI would love if an editor offered these three things (editor, terminal, and browser) in a tabbed View. Allowing multiple terminals is a big plus.\nIs there such an IDE available?\n\nA: I think a better solutuion to your alt-tabbing problem would be, instead of trying to find an IDE which integrates all the things you need (what about an IRC client? Skype?) - is to use a window manager which helps you to organize your windows in a way which eliminates alt-tabbing and provides instant access to all your windows.\nHave a look at some tiling window managers - I personally use Xmonad but there are a few others.\nThis way you will be able to use \"real\" programs - a real browser, a real terminal client - instead of their embedded versions.\nHere's a picture from xmonad.org:\n\n\nA: Geany has a built-in terminal in the Message window. As far as I'm aware, there is no way to add a browser to a tab, but it is possible to load a page in a new browser window and have it focus. \nI personally just move my current applications to the top of the launcher so that I can use super+1 for Geany and super+2 for my application, for instance. That way, it's just as easy to switch between applications than it is to switch between tabs. \nIt should be possible to make a plugin to have a webkit in a tab in Geany, but I don't know of any such plugin. \n\nA: Redcar\n\nA Ruby text editor written in Ruby from the ground up runs on JRuby (a fast, compatible\nRuby implementation) is cross-platform (Linux, Mac OS X, Windows)\nhighly extensible Some Redcar features:\nsupports Textmate themes and snippets split screen mode syntax\nchecking for many languages built in REPLs for Ruby, Groovy, Clojure\nand Mirah.\n\nIt has got an unstable terminal plugin, and an inbuilt browser as well (both of which open in tabs)\n\n\nA: I suggest you also have a look at Light Table, one of the top 10 from KickStarter.

But the problem is that now my USB won't boot.\n\nA: Theres a good chance pendrive did not load an instance of grub on the USB Key that your bios could utilize/find.

I'm toying around with building an application to display messages on the screen on a desired intervals. \nI want to use cron to achieve that and I am considering my options. The most naive approach would be to print the commands directly into crontab. Is that a bad idea?\n\nA: No, it is not bad to have a long list in crontab. cron executes in minutes at the shortest time frame so it is not in real time but you can also have your notices in real time (see below).\n\nAs an alternative option you can also use cron to run 1 script that executes all your different crontab lines you otherwise would have included in your crontab where that file is executes or checks all the different options you want to get notices from. That would also be easier to maintain: if you need a new task you add it to your script and you can check if that job is flawed from the script itself (cron can be rather picky).\n\nMight I also suggest you also have a look at creating an upstart job.

I looked for a setting to adjust in ATI Catalyst Control, without success.\nEdit: I found a tiny adjustment knob on the bottom of the back of the monitor and was able to solve the problem.\n\nA: I don't think you can fix this problem via some software setting - for one thing, rotating the screen \"just a little\" would require quite a bit of processing power - and it still would be a picture rotated inside the skewed rectangle your monitor displays - hope you see what I'm trying to say.\nIn other words, it's most likely an electrical problem which can only be fixed by adjusting some pots inside the monitor, not via software.\n\nA: I'm not sure about the proprietary ATI drivers, but the RandR protocol does support setting a 3x3 transformation matrix.\nThis can be configured using the --transform option to the xrandr tool.

For example, if I set the limit to 128 MB, all files under that size will be saved to the RAM, and only saved to the HDD before shutdown.\n\nA: Firstly, the dangers of writing to an SSD drive may be greatly exaggerated - unless you're planning to prolong its life beyond year 2100 :)\nSecondly, keeping the data in RAM and then writing it to the disk later in one go is basically what Linux filesystem does anyway - though the emphasis is on preserving the data, not minimizing the number of writes. \nThirdly, you can create a ramdisk and save your temporary data there. Then I imagine you could have some script which rsync's the contents of the ramdrive with a folder on the disk. Then you can either invoke it manually (Big Save Button on your desktop) or add it to shutdown scripts. The whole thing would be pretty unreliable though.\nI mean - moving swap and logs off an SSD is one thing, but, say, not saving a document I'm working on to minimize the number of writes may be a bit extreme :) \n", "Q: Managing files and sync scenarios I am currently ripping my entire CD collection, thus generating large music files.

I now add my ripped music to my Ubuntu One folder on my laptop, but need to find a way to allow me to remove music from a folder which is set up to sync on my computer without removing them on Ubuntu One.\nI'm not sure if this makes sense, maybe I am coming at this from a wrong angle anyway.\n\nA: From the control panel on the computer with the small disc you tell syncdaemon to no longer sync the folder you need to empty:\n\nand then you can delete the folder and/or its contents without them being removed from Ubuntu One. If later the situation changes and you decide to re-enable sync, syncdaemon will do a “merge”, which should result in any new files in that folder getting added to the sync, but no deletions.\n\nA: Yes, this works, but it syncs the (old) files already on Ubuntu One with my laptop again causing it to run out of space :-)\nI guess the only solutions is to have more than one Music folder then.\nAh well, it was worth a try, and this feature is actually very handy in other circumstances.\n//HP.\n", "Q: How can I boot my usb from grub I am dual booting ubuntu 11.04 and windows 7 and I have a bootable usb flash drive.\nHow can I configure grub so it will boot my flash drive?\n\nA: Several ways. There is an application in Ubuntu Software Center called Startup-Manager, which can be used to edit grubs menu. It's not actively supported or developed since a couple of months ago though. The developer of Startup-manager recommends a software called Grub-customizer, which you can find here: https://launchpad.net/grub-customizer. Both of those applications are GUI apps. \nYou can edit the boot menu yourself. \nBut most BIOSes have a keyboard shortcut to display a boot menu from which you choose which device you want to boot from. That is a better solution, because then you don't have to do anything special to either device. You'll just install grub on both of them.\n\nA: As pointed out correctly by Jo Erland: the  method below refers to the old grub.\nI should check how it works with the new grub2.\nHowever, I still think that it is better to start the grub command line and to try booting using that command line than to edit the grub configuration directly. I will have a look tonight. In the meantime I still leave my old post here for reference.\n\nYou have to make sure that your bios supports booting from usb, and\n  the usb drive should be enabled as a bootable device. If this is the\n  case, you can follow the procedure outlined here to boot once from\n  usb: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/BootFromUSB You usb drive will\n  most likely be hd(1,0) if it is the second device from which the bios\n  can boot.\nIt is best to test this first, and once you find a combination that\n  works, you can edit your menu.lst to add a permanent entry (also\n  outlined in the above page).\nApart from that: most bioses support a hotkey to choose the boot\n  device (often F12). In that case you can boot from usb without having\n  to edit the grub configuration.\n\n\nA: What device it appears as in hardware listing is dependent on BIOS and hardware boot options.  If it already has an OS on it just connect it and run update-grub.  It should find it that way.  It's my understanding that grub2 uses UUIDs instead of hd(x,y) except for where it stores /boot.  Just a couple thoughts.  It should just work.\n", "Q: How not to enable bluetooth with hw-wireless switch? My laptop has hardware switch for enabling and disabling wireless adapters.

When I realized that this wasn't the way to go, I deleted the file, now running 'python' in terminal just hangs, I have restarted the machine, any ideas?\n\nA: sudo apt-get --reinstall install python\n\nThis will reinstall python from the command line, if you don't want to use Synaptic like loki2302 suggests. (Synaptic would be fine, of course.)\n\nA: Since you have an error after touching a file in /usr/local/bin, reinstalling python the ubuntu is most likely not needed and won't help at all.\nProbably you have installed a version of python yourself in /usr/local, which is now damaged. You can verify this by running /usr/bin/python. This should still work, whereas /usr/local/bin/python should give your error.\nIn this case you should uninstall your own version of python. If you still have the sources available you can use sudo make uninstall. Otherwise you should delete the python programs in /usr/local/bin (note the local).\n\nA: other wise if the Python won't run in terminal post does not work\nTry purge python which will remove all files and directories installed.

How do I copy files to all clients using puppet? I have setup a puppet server and clients and I have tested the connection which was working fine. I am not a puppet expert, I am just a beginner, and I just want to know how to copy files to all clients from the puppet server? I also want to know how to delete files?\n\nA: The Puppet File Server\nThis guide covers the use of Puppet’s file serving capability.\n\nThe puppet master service includes a file server for transferring static files. If a file resource declaration contains a puppet: URI in its source attribute, nodes will retrieve that file from the master’s file server:\n\n# copy a remote file to /etc/sudoers\nfile { \"/etc/sudoers\":\n    mode => 440,\n    owner => root,\n    group => root,\n    source => \"puppet:///modules/module_name/sudoers\"\n}\n\nAll puppet file server URIs are structured as follows:\npuppet://{server hostname (optional)}/{mount point}/{remainder of path}\n\nIf a server hostname is omitted (i.e. puppet:///{mount point}/{path}; note the triple-slash), the URI will resolve to whichever server the evaluating node considers to be its master. As this makes manifest code more portable and reusable, hostnames should be omitted whenever possible.\nThe remainder of the puppet: URI maps to the server’s filesystem in one of two ways, depending on whether the files are provided by a module or exposed through a custom mount point.\nServing Module Files\nAs the vast majority of file serving should be done through modules, the Puppet file server provides a special and semi-magical mount point called modules, which is available by default. If a URI’s mount point is modules, Puppet will:\n\n\n*\n\n*Interpret the next segment of the path as the name of a module…\n\n*... locate that module in the server’s modulepath (as described here under “Module Lookup”...\n\n*... and resolve the remainder of the path starting in that module’s files/ directory.\n\n*That is to say, if a module named test_module is installed in the central server’s /etc/puppet/modules directory, the following puppet: URI...\npuppet:///modules/test_module/testfile.txt\n\n...will resolve to the following absolute path:\n/etc/puppet/modules/test_module/files/testfile.txt\n\nIf test_module was installed in /usr/share/puppet/modules, the same URI would instead resolve to:\n/usr/share/puppet/modules/test_module/files/testfile.txt\n\nAlthough no additional configuration is required to use the modules mount point, some access controls can be specified in the file server configuration by adding a [modules] configuration block; see Security.\nServing Files From Custom Mount Points\nPuppet can also serve files from arbitrary mount points specified in the server’s file server configuration (see below). When serving files from a custom mount point, Puppet does not perform the additional URI abstraction used in the modules mount, and will resolve the path following the mount name as a simple directory structure.\nFile Server Configuration\nThe default location for the file server’s configuration data is /etc/puppet/fileserver.conf; this can be changed by passing the --fsconfig flag to puppet master.\nThe format of the fileserver.conf file is almost exactly like that of rsync, and roughly resembles an INI file:\n[mount_point]\n    path /path/to/files\n    allow *.domain.com\n    deny *.wireless.domain.com\n\nThe following options can currently be specified for a given mount point:\n\n\n*\n\n*The path to the mount’s location on the disk\n\n*Any number of allow directives\n\n*Any number of deny directives\n\n\npath is the only required option, but since the default security configuration is to deny all access, a mount point with no allow directives would not be available to any nodes.\nThe path can contain any or all of %h, %H, and %d, which are dynamically replaced by the client’s hostname, its fully qualified domain name and its domain name, respectively. All are taken from the client’s SSL certificate (so be careful if you’ve got hostname/certname mismatches). This is useful in creating modules where files for each client are kept completely separately, e.g. for private ssh host keys. For example, with the configuration\n[private]\n   path /data/private/%h\n   allow *\n\nthe request for file /private/file.txt from client client1.example.com will look for a file /data/private/client1/file.txt, while the same request from client2.example.com will try to retrieve the file /data/private/client2/file.txt on the fileserver.\nCurrently paths cannot contain trailing slashes or an error will result. Also take care that in puppet.conf you are not specifying directory locations that have trailing slashes.\nSecurity\nSecuring the Puppet file server consists of allowing and denying access (at varying levels of specificity) per mount point. Groups of nodes can be identified for permission or denial in three ways: by IP address, by name, or by a single global wildcard (*). Custom mount points default to denying all access.\nIn addition to custom mount points, there are two special mount points which can be managed with fileserver.conf: modules and plugins. Neither of these mount points should have a path option specified. The behavior of the modules mount point is described above under Serving Files From Custom Mount Points. The plugins mount is not a true mount point, but is rather a hook to allow fileserver.conf to specify which nodes are permitted to sync plugins from the Puppet Master. Both of these mount points exist by default, and both default to allowing all access; if any allow or deny directives are set for one of these special mounts, its security settings will behave like those of a normal mount (i.e., it will default to denying all access). Note that these are the only mount points for which deny * is not redundant.\nIf nodes are not connecting to the Puppet file server directly, e.g. using a reverse proxy and Mongrel (see Using Mongrel), then the file server will see all the connections as coming from the proxy server’s IP address rather than that of the Puppet Agent node. In this case, it is best to restrict access based on hostname. Additionally, the machine(s) acting as reverse proxy (usually 127.0.0.0/8) will need to be allowed to access the applicable mount points.\nPriority\nMore specific deny and allow statements take precedence over less specific statements; that is, an allow statement for node.domain.com would let it connect despite a deny statement for *.domain.com. At a given level of specificity, deny statements take precedence over allow statements.\nUnpredictable behavior can result from mixing IP address directives with hostname and domain name directives, so try to avoid doing that. (Currently, if node.domain.com’s IP address is 192.168.1.80 and fileserver.conf contains allow 192.168.1.80 and deny node.domain.com, the IP-based allow directive will actually take precedence. This behavior may be changed in the future and should not be relied upon.)\nHost Names\nHost names can be specified using either a complete hostname, or specifying an entire domain using the * wildcard:\n[export]\n    path /export\n    allow host.domain1.com\n    allow *.domain2.com\n    deny badhost.domain2.com\n\nIP Addresses\nIP address can be specified similarly to host names, using either complete IP addresses or wildcarded addresses. You can also use CIDR-style notation:\n[export]\n    path /export\n    allow 127.0.0.1\n    allow 192.168.0.*\n    allow 192.168.1.0/24\n\nGlobal allow\nSpecifying a single wildcard will let any node access a mount point:\n[export]\n    path /export\n    allow *\n\nNote that the default behavior for custom mount points is equivalent to deny *.\n", "Q: Audio Playback Problem I have this problem with all of my music player applications Banshee, Guayadeque and Amarok -when I click the Play button nothing happens, i.e. music doesnt start playing or the Play button doesnt change to a Pause button etc...

Too bad I couldn't find it on the shiny cups admin interface...\n\nA: I had the same problem as you, and I found a way to do this on my machine. On (X)ubuntu 14.04, I had to set the \"Job/Billing Info\" value in the print menu. Then, the print arrived correctly at my printer. I attached a screenshot for your reference.

In Chipaca's answer to Managing files and sync scenarios there's a screenshot with certain highlights. The highlights are the following:\n\n\n*\n\n*A row of a GUI list is highlighted by the other parts of the screenshot being darker.\n\n*A check mark is highlighted by being circled by what looks like a (orange) crayon.\n\n\nHow do I create both of these highlights on a screenshot? Is there an automated process?\nThe screenshot I'm referring to looks like this:\n\n\nA: Here's a guide for The GIMP\n\nCreate Highlighted Rectangle\n\n\n*\n\n*Select Rectangle Tool:\n\n\n*\n\n*tick Feather Edges choose Radius e.g. 5.0 pixels for smooth borders\n\n*tick Highlight to highlight the selection\n\n\n\n\n*Select area to highlight\n\n*Select → None to remove selection.\n\n\nThe selection is now highlighted.\n\nNote: in some versions of GIMP the highlighting may be removed as soon as we select another tool or save the image. In this case, we can proceed as follows to keep the area highlighted:\n\n\n*Invert the selection (Select → Invert or Ctrl+i).\n\n*Bucket-fill the background with black 30% opacity.\n\n\nCreate Crayon\n\n\n*Choose Ellipse Select Tool or e to select area for crayon\n\n*Select → Border e.g. with 8 pixels\n\n*Paintbrush Tool choose brush e.g. Galaxy, choose color e.g. yellow\n\n*Paint selection until happy\n\n\n\n\nA: *\n\n*Take a screenshot\nI use shutter and gnome-screenshot to take screenshot, you may use any one of them.To install them, use the commands.\nsudo apt-get install shutter\nsudo apt-get install gnome-screenshot\n\n\n*Install gimp\nWe will need this for the editing.Install it with \nsudo apt-get install gimp\n\n\n*Get the screenshot into gimp\nI dragged the image into gimp.You may use file -->open\n\n*The fun begins\n\n\n*\n\n*We first select the part we want white.We can hold Shift to select multiple areas. Then we invert the selection using Ctrl+I\n\n\n*Then we select the paintbrush tool.\n\n\n*Now we change the opacity and increase size.\n\n\n*Paint everything.If it's darker, change opacity and try again.For me, 50% was fine.\nAnd the end result is.\n\n\nNOTE: The options for gimp were available easily for me because I have customised it a lot. Use some gimp tutorial to learn how to use it.\n\n\nA: You can do this in editors such as Pinta, Shutter*, the GIMP, etc.\nThe process may vary, but one way to do it, would be to place a translucent square/rectangle in a second layer above the image, and then to cut out the part that you want to glow.\nExample workflow:\n\n\n\n*\n\n*Open your screenshot in Pinta.\n\n\n*\n\n*Create a new layer.\n\n*Select the new layer\n\n*Choose the paintbucket tool.\n\n*Change the colour to black, but set the opacity to 150.\n\n*Now use the rectangle selection tool to select the area you want to highlight.\n\n*Fill the layer with this colour.\n\n*Hit delete.\n\n\n*The image should now be highlighted.\n\n\n\n\n* Shutter is more for accomplishing the reverse effect.\n\nA: Using Shutter\nI think it is actually easier to use shutter both for the screenshot and for the highlight. Shutter is an awesome GUI screenshot and image editing tool.\n1. Install shutter\nIf you don't have shutter installed, you can quickly install it via the terminal:\nsudo apt install shutter\n2. Launch shutter\nLaunch shutter using your favourite method. This is on Ubuntu 16.04.\n\n3. Take your screenshot.\nLet's use google's homepage:\n\n4. Reopen Shutter's main window\nYou will be greeted by a screen like this showing your last screenshot. Click on the Edit button at the top right corner.\n\n5. The edit window\nThis will open such a window with the edit tools and buttons on the left hand side.\n\nAmong the tools you can use include:\n\n*\n\n*Highlight some parts of the screenshot using the  Color highlighter\n\n*Add custom text using the Text tool\n\n*Add shapes like lines, arrows, rectangles, ellipses, etc\n\n*Censor parts of the screenshot using a smudge tool or the pixelize tool.\n\n*You can also crop some parts out\n\nEdit the screenshot as required then click the save button on the top left corner to save the changes.\nThe screenshot below shows the effect of some of these tools:\n\nHappy editing.\n\nA: Whenever you have a workflow like the ones shown in the other answers for the GIMP, it's somewhat easy to automate them at least partially (with the restrictions that scripts have compared to plugins) by writing some Script-Fu (so, Scheme), or Python.  If the script is written to respect undo/redo, this also makes experimenting with the values a little bit easier, because it's just a keypress away to remove all traces of the effect again.\nHere's a script automates the highlighting part, because I might use that myself going forwards.\nScripts go into ~/.config/GIMP/2.10/scripts (or e.g. ~/.gimp-2.8/scripts, respectively other version numbers), then you only have to start the program, or use Filters > Script-Fu > Refresh Scripts if the file was added when it was already running.\nAfterwards, select something and use Filters > Light and Shadow > Highlight Area... to create a new highlight (well, shadow really) layer:\n\nThis is also how the highlights would look with 5px of feather applied.\nFeathering is optional, after all you can achieve the same effect by using the feather option of the selection tool; using layer opacity can make fiddling with the colour a bit easier, but if you want to paint on top it's easier to go with alpha fill (alternatively another layer would have to be added).\n", "Q: Nautilus Menu appearing behind transparent gnome-shell menubar I installed Ubuntu 11.10 beta when it was released a couple of weeks ago. Everything is working fine.   \nLater I installed GNOME shell and then upgraded it from the gnome-shell testing ppa. I also installed and enabled all the gnome-shell-extensions available on the ppa. There is only one problem. When ever I switch to a theme which has a transparent gnome-shell menu I see nautilus menu behind it. \n\nIt only disappears when I quit nautilus. I don't know I to get rid of it so that I can use use themes like Nord and Malys properly.\n\nA: That actually happens with the official Gnome Shell packages in Ubuntu 11.10 too (at least for me, at the time I'm posting this answer).\nI only know a fix for this: disabling Nautilus from handling the desktop (so using this, you won't have icons on the desktop anymore). To do this, install \"dconf-tools\":\nsudo apt-get install dconf-tools\n\nThen launch \"dconf-editor\", navigate to org > gnome > desktop > background and uncheck the \"show-desktop-icons\" box.\n\nA: AFAIK this is a bug in nautilus that occurs when ever there is no window manager running, and apparently also happens in GNOME Shell. I'm still trying to figure out myself what triggers it specifically, so I can report a bug with the correct details.\nI believe it is probably already noticed by the developers however.\nHopefully, as 11.10 is still not at a final release, this bug should be fixed by the release date.\n", "Q: What's the default serif font in firefox?

To the get the list on your computer use fc-match and specify a font name to match against.

The sans-serif default I likewise understand to be \"Sans\", an unbranded version of Bitstream Vera Sans. (And by now you've perhaps figured out that \"Monospace\" is really Bitstream Vera Sans Mono . . . .)\nEDIT: ttf-bitstream-vera is in universe in the latest few releases of Ubuntu. In light of this, I believe that belacqua is correct in judging the font used ultimately to be of the DejaVu family (which is a rebranded Bitstream Vera with better international character support, I believe). The font used is still Serif (the same goes for Sans and Monospace), but this links to DejaVu rather than Bitstream Vera.\n\nA: On my 11.04 system with firefox 6.0 and on my 11.10 beta system with firefox 7.0, the only serif font I see used is this one: \n/usr/share/fonts/truetype/ttf-dejavu/DejaVuSerif.ttf\nThis comes from the ttf-dejavu package, which appears to be installed by default on 11.04 and 11.10:\n\nDescription: Metapackage to pull in ttf-dejavu-core and\n  ttf-dejavu-extra  DejaVu provides an expanded version of the Vera font\n  family aiming for  quality and broader Unicode coverage while\n  retaining the original Vera  style.

If it still reports that the card is not available then the card has most probably died.\nI've just checked ebay - lots of dell inspiron 1545 mini cards for less than $10.

Something in /etc/skel would be fine\nI suspect the reason it gets out of sync is because we use a little web app to change passwords.

(I had wanted to do that anyway.) \"/etc/fstab\" contained the following line:\n/dev/mapper/cryptswap1 none swap sw 0 0\n\nLooking at \"/etc/crypttab\", I found a reference to the old swap partition, sda7:\ncryptswap1 /dev/sda7 /dev/urandom swap,cipher=aes-cbc-essiv:sha256\n\nI changed the line to use the new partition /dev/sda2, which I had formatted as swap:\ncryptswap1 /dev/sda2 /dev/urandom swap,cipher=aes-cbc-essiv:sha256\n\nI then turned swap back on, and it seems to work. \"free -m\" now tells me I have the 4 GB free swap space available in the partition, even after restarting.\nHowever, I am a little suspicious that it should be so easy to just rewire swap through one little file entry. Also, the Disk Utility does not show the partition as being used as swap; it says \"Usage: -\".\nHave I missed something? Are there other or additional steps I should follow to properly reconfigure the swap partition?\n\nA: If /dev/sda2 has been properly formatted as swap, that change should be all that is needed. If free -m and swapon -s report the swap partition you can assume it is working.\n", "Q: How can I hibernate from GNOME Shell? GNOME Shell doesn't have an option to hibernate in the session menu.

There is an extension that adds extra options for power management, but having not had sucess installing extensions myself, I cannot tell you for sure how to install it.\nFor now, you can hit alt + f2 and type pmi action hibernate or gnome-power-cmd hibernate (10.10 and lower only), then press enter. This will not give you any options, so only do this if you are sure you won't want to cancel.\nIf you want to make this easier, you could create a script with (using zenity to provide options) and place this in ~/bin. You could then create a keyboard binding for the script, so when you press (for example) alt+super+h your system would hibernate.\n\nA: On Ubuntu Gnome 14.04, Gnome 3.12, the following works (13 June 2014), but I have only set it up to work with pushing the power button and closing the lid (so no GUI button to push).\nCredit goes here, to the commentators, too.\nInstead of making a new file .../polkit-1/localauthority/50-local.d/com.ubuntu.enable-hibernate.pkla, sudo edit the existing \n/var/lib/polkit-1/localauthority/10-vendor.d/com.ubuntu.desktop.pkla\n\nand activate hibernation there, by changing ResultActive=no to ResultActive=yes, to obtain the following sections:\n[Disable hibernate by default in upower]\nIdentity=unix-user:*\nAction=org.freedesktop.upower.hibernate\nResultActive=yes\n\n[Disable hibernate by default in logind]\nIdentity=unix-user:*\nAction=org.freedesktop.login1.hibernate\nResultActive=yes\n\nThis allows the machine to hibernate. \nTo activate it on lid closure, sudo edit \n/etc/systemd/logind.conf\n\nand change HandleLidSwitch=suspend to #HandleLidSwitch=hibernate.\nBefore doing this, I searched dconf editor for entries with hibernate and changed everything from suspend to hibernate (my machine cannot resume from suspend...)

By default, alternative status menu no longer displays the Hibernate option. The easiest way to fix this is to install the extension, newly added to the Ubuntu repositories, and then use gsettings to change the default:\nsudo apt-get install gnome-shell-extensions\ngsettings set org.gnome.shell.extensions.alternative-status-menu allow-hibernate true\n\nThen enable the extension in Tweak Tool and restart the shell (alt+f2 and enter r).\nDO NOT install the extension from extensions.gnome.org.\n\nA: Just install this GNOME Shell extension by sliding the slider. \nYour user menu should now show a few new extra options: Hibernate, and Power Off...\n\n\nA: dv3500ea In your link to GNOME Shell Cheat Sheet you got the answer:\n\nThe Power Off... menu entry is hidden by default. \n  You can make it visible by pressing the Alt key in the user menu.\n\nJust hold ALT\n\nA: You need to install \"gnome-shell-extensions-alternative-status-menu\" package if you are using gnome-shell testing ppa.

Recently I've bought my dream's notebook, a Dell XPS 15 but since then this dream became a kind of endless nightmare.\nI'm almost getting crazy to make my graphic card driver work properly, but it seems to be just impossible. Yes, I have a 2GB NVIDIA GeForce GT 540m (Optimus)  in it! It simply doesn't work. Every time I generate the xorg.conf Ubuntu hangs on while starting up, which forces me to remove this file to be able to start the notebook with the standard graphic settings.\nAnother problem is that the Dell XPS 15 does NOT have a VGA output, but a HDMI. So, to be able to use a second monitor I have to configure it by the NVIDIA X Server Settings, which just works if the driver is properly initialized with the xorg.conf. \nI've also tried to make it work with the Bumblebee, but unfortunately it didn't help me much with the HDMI output.\nDo you guys have any idea to solve this deadlock?\nIs there any way for me to use my second monitor?\n\nA: I have the same problem (XPS 15 L501). My shortcut (because it is not a solution!) was to use the mini display port output. With it, you can use the second monitor (projector, etc.).\nI tried also Bumblebee and Ironhide, but the problem is still there.\n\nA: https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/xserver-xorg-video-intel/+bug/844307\nI've filed a bug reagarding this issue.\n\nA: If you're trying to save an xorg.conf with the nvidia tool you'll have to completely switch off the integrated graphics within your BIOS - I was able to do it on my Thinkpad T410 - but apparently you can't do it on all Optimus graphics implementations.\n\nA: Just to add some information for those who are also looking for a solution for this Nvidia HDMI output issue.\nI sent a message to the Bumblebee Team twitter account and they answered me this:\n\n@jimjonesbr Indeed, a lot of laptop have HDMI output linked to the nVidia card. Bumblebee can't help for now, but will, we're looking at it.\n\nSo, don't waste your time trying to make it work with Bumblebee now, just stay tunned for their updates related to this :-)\n\nA: I also have a Dell XPS 15 L502 and have Ubuntu 11.10 installed. I faced similar issues related to NVIDIA graphics. Whenever I used enable the proprietary driver, Ubuntu start up would hang. As a result, I was unable to use the advanced graphics features, and my Gnome shell environment used to fallback to Gnome classic two panel.\nHowever, things have started working since I have installed Bumblebee. Jones, maybe you can try out Bumblebee. I also have x-swat ppa added.\n", "Q: I installed supertuxcart and can't figure out how to launch it I installed supertuxcart and can't figure out how to launch it or how to get Unity to point to it.\n(My system is AMD 939 4400x2, overclocked@2600mhz, DFI LANParty UT expert motherboard, 2x1Gig khx 400-xfx 7600 512mbx2 SLI, sata1 320Gig root sata1 400Gig, both Seagates.)\n\nA: Pressing Alt-F2 and starting to type \"supertux...\" should show it in the search results.\nAlternatively, you can right-click on the Applications button (a magnifying glass icon, third from the bottom), select Games category and click on Show all results.\n\nA: Press super (winkey) and start to type supertux until it's the only icon left and press enter, or just click on it when you find it. The dash learns from that, so if you often run supertux, then it'll be very quick to run. I often play PokerTH, for instance, so I can just press super and type \"po\" and press enter.

I verified the hash MD5sum thing. I get as far as GRUB with the 4 options (install, advanced install, disk verification, system rescue) but no matter which one I select, I get a blank screen and nothing happens. The DVD drive spins down after about 30 seconds. Also just before the GRUB screen I get a message saying Error: \"Prefix\" is not set. I'm not sure if that's relevant. \nI have tried all the options using both DVDs. Same thing happens. I have changed the graphics setting in BIOS to UMA or Optimus, but still happens either way. I've tried booting with the wireless switch turned off, same thing happens. \nI downloaded 'vanilla' Ubuntu 64-bit and burned onto a CD, and the same thing happens. \nI have downloaded Ubuntu 32-bit and I am able to boot from the live CD (interestingly the wireless card won't work, but that's maybe another issue).\nI have searched extensively through these forums and other sites but I can't see anything that will help me. \nIs there something I'm missing? I'd really appreciate help on this. The laptop is less than 2 weeks old. I was so looking forward to getting Ubuntu Studio up and running. I've gone about as far as my technical abilities will allow.\n\nThanks for taking the time to reply to my initial post.\nI'm having another go at installing Ubuntu 64-bit seeing as 11.10 is now out.  \nI've created a live cd for 11.10 AMD 64.\nNow what happens is that I get the \"Prefix\" is not set message, then it goes to a screen with a heavily distorted text, and that's it....\nSo 11.10 is not booting for me for me either.  \nThis seems crazy to me...  Please does anyone have any ideas?  A solution was posted here (http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?p=11497240#post11497240) but I don't quite follow it - it's written from the perspective of someone who already has Linux and is upgrading, which doesn't apply to me at all.  But the basic premise of it - that you could use the bootfiles from 10.04 64-bit - makes sense.  How would I - as someone who doesn't have experience of these things - blend the bootfiles from 10.04 wit the .iso image for 11.10???\n\nOk I got it sorted... I think.\nBefore that, just to mention that Ubuntu Studio is only available as an alternate image, so you can't boot it as a Live CD/USB.  I did not know this.  But I couldn't even get to the install menu anyway in 64-bit.\nI kind of managed to figure it out based on staticd's solution:[url]http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?p=11497240#post11497240[/url]  I couldn't fully use this solution because he/she appears to be starting from Ubuntu, whereas I'm still on Windows.  So my method is for creating a Live USB from a Windows machine.\nOh - I'm trying 11.10 now as opposed to 11.04, but I had the exact same problem with the Live CD for 11.10.  \nI downloaded Ubuntu 64-bit 10.04.  I also downloaded Ubuntu 64-bit 11.10.  \nI then created a Live USB for 10.04 using UNetBootIn.  \nI extracted Ubuntu 64-bit 11.10 to a normal Windows folder using WinRAR.  \nI opened up the folder for the Live USB in Windows Explorer.  I deleted the following folders from the 10.04 Live USB: .disk,  casper, dists, install, pics, pool, preseed (i.e. everything apart from the isolinux folder).\nI then copied all items from the 11.10 folder (so that's everything except for boot, efi and isolinux folders) into the Live USB folder.  Replace any files that have the same name.  \nI was then able to boot into the Live USB and into a live Ubuntu 64-bit session.  This method also worked to allow me to get as far as the installation menu in Ubuntu Studio 64-bit.\nWord of caution: this method worked to allow me to try a live session.  However, I don't know (because it's beyond my technical understanding) if messing with the .iso image like this will cause problems for an actual installation...\n\nA: I've bought brand new z570 with 6GB RAM and 750GB HDD and managed to install Kubuntu 11.10 x86_64. Here is some tips:\n\n\n*\n\n*I've seen distorted text in grub menu only if bios boot menu appear before you get to GRUB. I advice you to adjust boot priority and put CD or USBHDD at top of the list and then reboot (probably boot priority won't get saved due to buggy BIOS, see below). Even if text isn't readable, you could just hit ENTER to run first item, it would launch graphical installer.\n\n*When you successfully install ubuntu and reboot your laptop, you most likely will see the black screen (or your laptop will repeatly pop up menu to choose where to boot from). AFAIK, there is buggy BIOS on Z570, so I installed lastest BIOS from lenovo site. Problem solved.\nBIOS fix released November 1, 2011.\n", "Q: Youtube fails to load video I'm currently using Natty.

Just no video, or controls.\nSame issue happens on Google Chrome and in Firefox. Further making this issue strange is that it's only limited to youtube and no other video website.\n\nA: While nitstorm's answer might fix your problem temporarily, I suggest going another route:\nGoogle Chrome has its own built-in, auto-updated version of chrome.

I know that launchpad has the policy of only allowing upload of source packages on PPA's (as also explained here).\nYet, a python .deb package has all the source in it and it seems silly that one cannot use the stdeb extension and need to build the package manually... Is there a way to get around this?\nEDIT: From the first answers it seems I should clarify that I am developer who wrote the code, so I am really looking for the quicker way to make my program become a .deb in my ppa. I normally get .deb package in my system with:\npython setup.py --command-packages=stdeb.command bdist_deb\n\ngive that this allow me to reuse my setup.py script, which is standard in all python programs. I had a look at the python packaging guide here but it looks like I'm missing something, as it's hard to believe that in order to achieve the same result than the above one-liner I should work 10 times more... ?\n\nA: Looking at the README for that package, it supports building a Debian source package from your Python package via either the py2dsc utility or the sdist_dsc distutils command.\nOnce you've got a Debian source package, you should be able to upload it to your PPA with commands like:\n# Unpack the source package:\ndpkg-source -x package_version.dsc\n# Prepare a signed package upload:\ncd package-version/\ndebuild -S -sa\n# Upload the source package:\ncd ..\ndput $ARCHIVE package_version.upload\n\n\nA: No this is not possible.\nAnd this is a good thing. Ideally the goal of packaging from source is that you can clearly see which changes are only present in debian/ubuntu, and which sources come from upstream.\nChoosing in which directory files should be placed is a change which is distribution specific, it should be in a file which is distribution specific, seperate from the other sources.\nNote that a source package can be very simple: run dh_make in a package containing your source, update the control and copyright file and add the file you want to copy to the install file. If an update to the sources is there, you only have to unpack them and update the changelog.\n\nA: This worked for me:\npython setup.py --command-packages=stdeb.command debianize\n\nFrom their README:\n\nThe debianize command builds a debian/ directory directly alongside your setup.py.\n\n", "Q: What's the easiest way to remove the \"total \" line from the output of ls -l? The best I could find via Google/man ls was:\nls -l | grep -v '^total'\n\nIs there something I'm missing in the flags to ls?\nAlso, why is the total size in kb, regardless of the -h flag? scratch that, seems like it does, not sure what I was seeing then.\n\nA: Using wildcards to avoid having ls running the directory listing is suboptimal, because it prevents you from using ls options like --almost-all.\nLike Enzotib's suggestion, the simplest way to remove it is to pipe it through tail to chop off the first line. However, ls will detect that it its output is a pipe rather than interactive, and change its defaults in an unwanted way. Hence, to make it robust, you should also add some options:\n\n\n*\n\n*--color=always: keep showing colors\n\n*--hide-control-chars: print ? in filenames in place of control characters that could mess up the console output\n\n\nI have a script ~/bin/l (you could also use a Bash alias in ~/.bash_aliases):\n#!/bin/bash\nls -l --color=always --hide-control-chars \"$@\" | tail --lines=+2\n\nYou can also add any other ls options you want by default, e.g. --group-directories-first --time-style='+%FT%T.%N%:::z' --indicator-style=slash.\n\nA: ls -l *\nWill give you \"normally named\" folder contents without the total.  That might be suitable for your needs.  Unfortunately, it will not give you the dot prefixed files.  If you use ls -l * .* you will get a mess since linux will navigate up the tree. \nNote the dot prefix could mean the folder or with a wildcard it means the above folder so it does not help you to pick regular files that are dot prefixed.  This seems to have been an unfortunate design decision.\n\nA: \n$ ls -l [DIRECTORY] | sed 1d  (output contains file names)\n$ ls -ld [path-to-dir]/*  (output contains relative paths but will\n  preserve colors)\n$ ls -l [DIRECTORY] | tail -n +2\n$ ls -l [DIRECTORY] | awk 'NR>=1'\n\n\nNote: \nThe following doesn't work if you have a file named \"total....\"\n\n$ ls -l | grep -v '^total'\n\n\nA: Looking in the source code of coreutils, I found out that total will always be displayed when using the -l option on directories.\nUsing the -d option to list entries instead of directory contents hides total. But if you run that without arguments (or on a directory), it'll just show the directory and not its contents. Therefore, you need wildcards. * matches all files and .* matches hidden files as well (which corresponds with the -a option):\nls -ld * .*\n\nAs for the -h option, it works for me. 1118360 bytes show up as 1.1M. Files smaller than 1024 show up in bytes.\n\nA: To answer your exact question would be ls -1A . which displays files, directories, and hidden files/directories, does not use any pipes or external tools (grep/tr/cut..), and does not rely on turning on or off any shell globbing options such as extglob, globstar, or nullglob. I have tested it to verify that statement.\n-1    list one file per line.  Avoid '\\n' with -q or -b\n-A,   --almost-all           do not list implied . and ..\n\nExample output:\nuser@host:/dir$ ls -1A .\ntemp\nterraform\n.test\ntor\ntorrent-stuff\n.Trash-1000\nvirtual_appliance\nvisualblind\nvpn-ipv4.txt\nvpn-ipv6.txt\nzztestfile\n.zztestfile2\n\nAs a side note, here is what I keep in my .bash_aliases relating to listing dirs/files:\n# ls directories\nalias lsd2='ls -d */'\nalias lsd3='ls -p . | grep -E \"/$\" | tr -d \"/\"'\nalias lsd4='ls -lA | grep -E \"^d\"'\nalias lsd5='ls -pv . | grep -E \"/$\" | tr -d \"/\"'\nalias lsd='ls -lAd */'\n# ls files\nalias lsf='ls -pA | grep -vE \"/$\"'\nalias lsf2='ls -p | grep -v \"/\"'\nalias lsf3='ls -p . | grep \"/\" | tr -d \"/\"'\nalias lsf4='ls -lA | grep -vE \"^d\"'\n# ls normal\nalias lsnormal='ls -lAh1d *'\nalias lsnormal2='ls -1 .'\n\n", "Q: Find the latest file by modified date If I want to find the latest file (mtime) in a (big) directory containing subdirectories, how would I do it?\nLots of posts I've found suggest some variation of ls -lt | head (amusingly, many suggest ls -ltr | tail which is the same but less efficient) which is fine unless you have subdirectories (I do).\nThen again, you could\nfind . -type f -exec ls -lt \\{\\} \\+ | head\n\nwhich will definitely do the trick for as many files as can be specified by one command, i.e. if you have a big directory, -exec...\\+ will issue separate commands; therefore each group will be sorted by ls within itself but not over the total set; the head will therefore pick up the lastest entry of the first batch.\nAny answers?\n\nA: You do not need to recur to external commands (as ls) because find can do all you need through the -printf action:\nfind /path -printf '%T+ %p\\n' | sort -r | head\n\n\nA: This is on my system faster than printf, though I don't understand why\nfind /path -type f -exec stat -c \"%y %n\" {} + | sort -r | head\n\n\nA: EDIT: I guess this post is not 'not particularly useful' as I thought it was. This is a really fast solution that just keeps track of the most recently modified file (instead of sorting the entire list of files):\nfind . -type f -printf '%T@ %p\\n' | awk 'BEGIN { mostrecenttime = 0; mostrecentline = \"nothing\"; } { if ($1 > mostrecenttime) { mostrecenttime = $1; mostrecentline = $0; } } END { print mostrecentline; }' | cut -f2- -d ' '\nSpread over multiple lines for clarity it looks as follows:\nfind . -type f -printf '%T@ %p\\n' | awk '\n    BEGIN { mostrecenttime = 0; mostrecentline = \"nothing\"; }\n    {\n        if ($1 > mostrecenttime)\n            { mostrecenttime = $1; mostrecentline = $0; }\n    }\n    END { print mostrecentline; }' | cut -f2- -d ' '\n\nEnd of EDIT\n\nNot a particularly useful post but since 'arrange' was discussing speed, I thought I'd share this.\narrange's and enzotib's solutions involve listing all files inside the directory with their mtimes and then sorting. As you know sorting is not necessary to find the maximum. Finding maximum can be done in linear time but sorting takes n log(n) time [I know the difference isn't much, but still ;)]. I can't think of a neat way of implementing this. [EDIT: A neat (albeit dirty looking) and fast implementation provided above.]\nNext best thing - To find the most recently edited file in a directory, recursively find the most recently edited file in each level 1 subdirectory. Let this file represent the subdirectory. Now sort the level 1 files along with the representatives of the level 1 subdirectories. If the number of number of level 1 files and sub-dirs of each directory is nearly a constant, then this process should scale linearly with total number of files.\nThis is what I came up with to implement this:\nfindrecent() { { find \"$1\" -maxdepth 1 -type f -exec stat -c \"%y %n\" {} + | sort -r | head -1 && find \"$1\" -mindepth 1 -maxdepth 1 -type d -exec findrecent {} \\;; } | sort -r | head -1; }\nfindrecent .\n\nI ran this and got a bunch of find: findrecent: No such file or directory errors. Reason: -exec of find runs in a different shell. I tried defining findrecent in .bashrc, .xsessionrc but these didn't help [I'd appreciate help here]. In the end I resorted to putting\n#!/bin/bash\n{ find \"$1\" -maxdepth 1 -type f -exec stat -c \"%y %n\" {} + | sort -r | head -1 && find \"$1\" -mindepth 1 -maxdepth 1 -type d -exec findrecent {} \\;; } | sort -r | head -1;\n\nin a script called findrecent in my PATH and then running it.\nI ran this, kept waiting and waiting with no output. Just to be sure I wasn't dealing with any infinite loops I modified the file to\n#!/bin/bash\necho \"$1\" >&2\n{ find \"$1\" -maxdepth 1 -type f -exec stat -c \"%y %n\" {} + | sort -r | head -1 && find \"$1\" -mindepth 1 -maxdepth 1 -type d -exec findrecent {} \\;; } | sort -r | head -1;\n\nand tried again. It did work - but took 1 minute 35 seconds on my homefolder - arrange's and enzotib's solutions took 1.69, 1.95 seconds respectively!\nSo much for O(n)'s superiority over O(n log (n))! Damn you function call overhead! [Or rather script call overhead]\nBut this script does scale better than the earlier solutions and I bet it'll run faster than them on google's memory bank ;D\n\nA: Use perl in conjonctin with find : \n find my_directory -type f -printf '%T@\\t%p\\n' | perl -ane '@m=@F if ($F[0]>$m[0]); END{print $m[1];}'\n\nYou get the name of the file with the greatest epoch == last file modified.\n\nA: I had a similar problem today, but I attacked it without find.  I needed something short I could run over ssh to return the most recently edited file in my home directory.  This is roughly what I came up with:\nls -tp | grep -v /$ | head -1\n\nThe -p option to ls adds a trailing slash to directories, the grep -v removes lines ending in a slash (aka, all directories), and the head -1 limits the output to a single file.\nThis is much less verbose than using find if all you want to return is the file name.\n\nA: It's not nearly as fashionable, but it's also possible to achieve this with Midnight Commander: search for *, panelize the result, sort by  modification time in reverse order.\nObviously, it's a bit slower than find - my home directory, containing 922000 files, was sorted by mc in almost 14 minutes while find spent less than 5 - but there are some benefits:\n\n\n*\n\n*I'd probably spend longer then the 9 minutes difference inventing a proper find invocation :)\n\n*less chance of an error (forgot to specify -r for sort etc. - start again) \n\n*it's possible to play with the result set by changing sort order etc. - without re-querying the files.\n\n*possible to perform file operations only on some files from the result set - i.e. sort by size, delete a few large files which are not needed\n", "Q: Persisting increased playback speed between videos in VLC The playback speed reverts to 1x with every new video in a playlist, however, this isn't the behavior I want.

From what I read, when mounting a network share via nautilus or gvfs-mount the mount point should be in ~/.gvfs. This seems not to be the case for me: I tried mounting both an FTP and SMB share via both nautilus and gvfs-mount under both Ubuntu Maverick and Natty and in none of the cases did I see any mount point under ~/.gvfs. I can access the shares just find in nautilus, but I want to have access via the command line, which is why I need a mount point in the file system.\nEdit: Debugging following James Henstridge's answer and enzotib's comment revealed that on my laptop gvfs-fuse-daemon is running and consequently gvfs mounts show up in ~/.gvfs, whereas on the 2 workstations where ~/.gvfs remained empty gvfs-fuse-daemon was not running. On all 3 machines there are other gvfs processes running: gvfsd, gvfs-afc-volume-monitor, ...\nOn the laptop, mount | fgrep gvfs yields\ngvfs-fuse-daemon on /home/xxx/.gvfs type fuse.gvfs-fuse-daemon (rw,nosuid,nodev,user=xxx)\n\nThat raises the questions:\n\n\n*\n\n*How are shares mounted without gvfs-fuse-daemon running? Is there no mount point created in that case and is every access to the share a gvfs library call? Which daemon is responsible? gvfsd?\n\n*What's the role of gvfs-fuse-daemon? Does it only create a fuse mount point in ~/.gvfs?\n\n\nUpdate: On 12.10 and later, mounts are under /run/user/<login>/gvfs.\n\nA: In Ubuntu 12.10 the paths were changed:\n$ mount |grep gvfs\ngvfsd-fuse on /run/user/pcm/gvfs type fuse.gvfsd-fuse (rw,nosuid,nodev,user=pcm)\n\n\nA: I have a similar problem with my 12.04 Precise system.\nDrives that appear mounted in Nautilus do not appear in ~/.gvfs, particularly after a suspend/resume cycle. gvfs-fuse-daemon is running, but killing it and restarting does not fix the problem.\nI found that restarting Nautilus after nautilus -q causes gvfs-fuse-daemon and Nautilus to co-operate again - the mount points reappear.\n\nA: On Debian 6.0 wheezy, with lxde and nautilus.\nI found the ~/.gvfs directory empty too. I tried to run\n/usr/lib/gvfs/gvfs-fuse-daemon ~/.gvfs\n\nBut it told me: /dev/fuse: Permission Denied.\n$ ll /dev/fuse\ncrw-rw---T 1 root fuse 10, 229 Dec 21 11:59 /dev/fuse\n\nI thought that maybe it's because I'm not in the fuse group, then I added my user account to that group.\nAfter a reboot, the gvfs mount shows in ~/.gvfs correctly.\n\nA: In newer versions of Ubuntu, gvfs defaults to mounting in /run/user/$USER/gvfs/. \nYou can check yourself where it's default mount point is by looking for your user's gvfsd-fuse line in /etc/mtab.\n\nA: Solved the problem (kind of).\nOn Ubuntu 12.10 the mountpoint appears in /run/user/(your username)/gvfs/sftp\\:host\\=\\192.168.xxx.xxx.\nHope that helps\n\nA: I asked a related question for my Debian system, and the answer was to:\napt-get install gvfs-fuse\nadduser <username> fuse\n\nThen reboot. After a GVFS mount (via Nautilus), the share directory will be in one of two places, depending on which version of Debian or Ubuntu you have:\n/run/user/<username>/gvfs\n~/.gvfs\n\n\nA: The ~/.gvfs directory should be a FUSE mount handled by the gvfs-fuse-daemon process.  If the directory appears to be empty, it would indicate that gvfs-fuse-daemon did not start correctly.\nYou could try starting it manually with the following command:\n/usr/lib/gvfs/gvfs-fuse-daemon ~/.gvfs\n\nIf that fails, you could try checking whether anything else is mounted there, or even delete and recreate the ~/.gvfs directory first.  If things still fail, could you update your question and provide any error messages printed by gvfs-fuse-daemon?\n** On 14.04 the daemon is called gvfsd-fuse and can be found in /usr/lib/gvfs/gvfsd-fuse.\n\nA: When I want to access files shared from a Windows machine directly (not browsing through Nautilus) I mount the share on a folder in my home directory.\nFor example.

Both are ATA drives.  One is a DVD-RW DL; the other is just a DVD ROM.  Under both Ubuntu 10.04 and 10.10 I am seeing the same symptoms from both drives.\nWhen I first boot the system, the drives seem to run normally.  I can watch DVDs with no problem from mplayer, vlc, and even MythTV.  If I leave the machine running for several hours (say over night), and try to access the DVD drives in the morning, they are very, very slow (transfer rates in 10's of kBytes, not Mbytes).  If I then reboot the machine, things go back to normal.\nWhen the drives slow down, other function on the machine seem to be running with no problems or slowdown. Looking at htop and iotop don't show any amount of unusual activity.  I have looked in dmesg and syslog, but nothing seems to out of the ordinary.  I have tried enabling and disabling DMA for the drives.\nThe searching I have done on the internet suggests that some others have seen the problem.  In some cases, upgrading to the 2.6.36 (or later) kernel has seemed to help, and in some cases it hasn't.  (BTW, I am currently running the latest 10.10 official kernel on the machine.)\nDoes anyone have any ideas or suggestions on what to look at?\n--- Update 2011-09-04 ---\nSo, inspired by Sebastian's comment, I decided to write a simple script to log a time stamp, the test DVD ROM Speed (hdparm -tT /dev/sr0), the hd settings for the cdrom, and the running process to a log file.  The script has been running for over a day, and the DVD ROM is also still running quite happily and quickly.  The machine has also been on for over 2 days.  It looks like a quantum problem -- as soon as you observe it, it goes away.\nI also made one other change since last booting, so maybe it had something to do with it.  The USB mouse I had been using started periodically not working.  It would just freeze up.  This was both in Gnome and KDE.  I removed that mouse from the system and installed a new USB mouse.  Now the mouse is working fine.  Perhaps the problems with the old mouse were causing secondary effects.  (I know, it sounds like a long shot.)\n\nA: If no one know the solution I think that maybe doing the following ones when the dvd drive is fast and ones when the dvd drive is slow maybe helps you:\nsudo hdparm -i /dev/sr0\nIt could also not help you.

It may be set to ‘text’ to force the Linux kernel to boot in normal text mode, ‘keep’ to preserve the graphics mode set using ‘gfxmode’, or any of the permitted values for ‘gfxmode’ to set a particular graphics mode (see gfxmode).\nDepending on your kernel, your distribution, your graphics card, and the phase of the moon, note that using this option may cause GNU/Linux to suffer from various display problems, particularly during the early part of the boot sequence. If you have problems, set this variable to ‘text’ and GRUB will tell Linux to boot in normal text mode.\nThe default is platform-specific. On platforms with a native text mode (such as PC BIOS platforms), the default is ‘text’. Otherwise the default may be ‘auto’ or a specific video mode.\nThis variable is often set by ‘GRUB_GFXPAYLOAD_LINUX’ (see Simple configuration).\n\n\nBut more importantly: I found the message error: no video mode activated you get on Bug 699802 and it has a possible solution:\n\nDecommenting #GRUB_GFXMODE=640x480 in /etc/default/grub actually solves the problem.\n  Remember to run sudo update-grub after changing /etc/default/grub.\n\nAlso look at comment 27 and also comment 24 and 30 as interesting workarounds. Comment 30:\n\nJust wanted to confirm that the method for number 24 works well for people with the encrypted partition (don't bother with the uncommenting stuff). Just so anyone like myself out there doesn't have to look all over to figure out how to do simple commands (my first time ever using linux). Launch the terminal and go to the directory cd /usr/share/grub/ . Copy the font files to another directory (cp, needs sudo, and *.pft copies the three font files at once) with sudo cp *.pf2 /boot/grub then update grub with sudo update-grub.\n\n", "Q: How GRUB setting noapic affects the system? What are the known issues when setting GRUB to boot with noapic? How does the setting affect the system or programs in it?\nThis quick answer explains what noapic does, but is there some example situations?\nThis question is connected to this problem: Unable to install/boot 11.04 on a ThinkPad L520.\n\nA: Varies from system-to-system.  Some reports of USB issues have been made.\nHave you tried booting with apic=debug and posting the logs and dmesg output etc?\nUpgrading the BIOS might provide a fix to the issue that causes apic to fail for you too.\n\nA: FYI on this (Thinkpad/Ubuntu) I have found that using \"noapic\" on Ubuntu 12.04 (64-bit) on a Lenovo Thinkpad L420 (Intel Core-i5-2520M) is the only way to get suspend/hibernate/shutdown working in all ways (FN buttons or pm-suspend, etc.).

Ubuntu-One CP on my laptop correctly shows the storage available, but then the UbuntuOne folder on my home shows only 3,6Gb available, this creates an error if I try to upload my 10Gbs of data through the Ubuntu-One folder. Anyone can help me out?\n\nA: This means that there is 3.6 GB available locally, on the partition where a copy of your cloud-stored files is stored. So to actually use these 20 GB of space you have on the cloud, you need 20 GB of free space on the partition where Ubuntu One keeps your local copy of your cloud-stored files.\n", "Q: Wine application in Gnome requires an extra click to become focused I'm using Tera Term, a Windows virtual terminal emulator with Wine due to a legacy application. Everything else works wonderfully, but for some reason the window requires two clicks to gain focus.

With TeraTerm it seems to work out of the box.\nI did not actually install the software in the usuaul sense - I just ran the executable that I copied from a Windows installation and it worked just fine besides the focus issue.

In Unity, when running an application as a superuser, the menu is in the old-style. It's not integrated in the global menu. Why?\n\nA: This is a bug, but it hasn't had a status update in awhile.\n\nThis is not supported at the moment. There are 2 aspects to this bug.\nThe first aspect is that we use standard dbus calls, and don't\n  differentiate between the real and effective user id to connect to the\n  session bus. As a result, sudo apps are sharing a /distinct/ bus.\n  dbusmenu could workaround that potentially.\nThe second aspect (more serious) is that the security implications\n  would probably dictate that menus of sudo apps be exposed with some\n  special color or rendering, to ensure the user is conscious that he is\n  interacting with privileged apps. That's more a design aspect.\nOn the latter, you can argue however that sudo apps are currently\n  displayed as normal apps, so the solution for that design is actually\n  a more general problem to address.\n\nVia Launchpad Bug report\n", "Q: How do I add an RSS feed in Evolution?

I think the title sums up the question. I want to install Ubuntu via EFI, but I don't want to eliminate the OSX partition either (and I'd still like to be able to boot either).\n\nA: Yes, as fossfreedom says, you can install Ubuntu in EFI mode on a Mac. One caveat is that hardware support seems variable (and is constantly changing). Some people swear that important hardware (like video devices) don't work properly in EFI mode. Others have no problems. As a general rule, support is improving, but I don't know if absolutely everything is supported yet. (OTOH, some hardware seems to work better in EFI mode than in BIOS mode.)\nOne more point: rEFIt is a boot manager. Although it can direct the boot process to a BIOS-mode installation, it won't disable an EFI-mode installation. In fact, it can be used as the first stage in an EFI-only boot process, enabling you to select Linux vs. OS X, both of which boot in EFI mode. (FWIW, rEFIt seems to have been abandoned. I've forked the project as rEFInd.)\n\nA: Ubuntu 11.04 (Natty) supports booting from EFI as explained by this Ubuntu community wiki.\n\"From Ubuntu 11.04 onwards (x86_64 only), the ISO CD supports UEFI booting and the Ubuntu installer will try to setup the bootloader got (U)EFI boot.\"\nHowever there is a warning:\n\nthe installer formats the EFI SYSTEM PARTITION to FAT16 (even if the\n  filesystem is non-empty) and also uses efibootmgr, due to which Intel\n  Macs may fail to boot due to corrupted firmware. This feature is not\n  recommended on Mac models because it can corrupt the firmware. You\n  will need to reflash the firmware to repair it.\nOn Macs use only the Mac alternate ISO CD\n\nThe alternate CD is a text based installer.  You will be able to repartition your disk to hold both your MacOS and Ubuntu.  \nAs with all installations - make sure you have a full disk image backup first before repartitioning and installing just in-case the installation fails for whatever reason.\n", "Q: How do I make an application start only in XFCE?

This question has already been asked and answered for GTK-2.0 here ( Disable resize gripper in windows? ) but I couldn't find a way to achieve this on GTK-3.0 (on Oneiric Ocelot).\nI've seen the answer on the above link where it is needed to recompile GTK ... I seriously hope that's not the case with GTK-3.0 and that there's a workaround like with gtk-2.0. \nNow, before someone comes and asks why I would want to remove this resize grip , here's why : \n\n\n*\n\n*I haven't used a resize grip or border in years, I use Alt+Click. I literally freak out when I have to use OS X or Windows.\n\n*Sometime it shows up when it shouldn't. Splash screen, widgets, etc ... \n\n*I don't find it visually appealing.\n\n\nIf this is hardcoded into gtk-3.0 then there should be an option in gconf or dconf to disable it.\nI've fetched the source for gtk-3.0 and this seems to be related to the 063_resize_grip_default.patch where a configuration key is mentioned : \"resize-grip-default\".\nWhen I grep for this in the themes I get this : \n/usr/share/themes $ grep -ri resize-grip-default *\nAmbiance/gtk-3.0/gtk-widgets.css:    -GtkWindow-resize-grip-default: false;\nRadiance/gtk-3.0/gtk-widgets.css:    -GtkWindow-resize-grip-default: false;\n\nIf this configuration value is set to false, where does the resize grip come from ?\n\nA: I could disable the resize grips by putting into ~/.config/gtk-3.0/gtk.css the following code:\n* {\n    -GtkWindow-resize-grip-default: false;\n}\n\nor similarly to .gtkrc-2.0\n* {\n    -GtkWindow-resize-grip-height: 0;\n    -GtkWindow-resize-grip-width: 0;\n}\n\n", "Q: Displaying a \"scrolling\" log file Via command line, I have a log file I'd like to keep track of.\nWhat I want is to have, basically, a tail that refreshes when the log is updated making the text scroll upwards as new lines are appended to the log file.\nIs there anything out there that does that without having to write some code?\n\nA: Does\ntail -f something.log\n\ndo what you want?\n\nA: tail has two implementations to follow and output data that gets appended to a file\n\n\n*\n\n*follow the file descriptor\n\n*follow a file with a certain name\n\n\nWith parameter -f, --follow and --follow=descriptor, tail follows the file descriptor. This method allows the file to be followed across a renaming but the tracking stops when the file is rotated (a new file is created with a different file descriptor).\nWhen following files that are rotated, either use --follow=name or -F parameter which equals to --follow=name --retry. That way tail will periodically reopen the file to overcome the possible rotation.\n\nA: tail has the -f option:\nFrom the man page:\n\n-f, --follow[={name|descriptor}]\n                output appended data as the file grows; -f, --follow,\n  and --follow=descriptor are equivalent\n\nThus if you type:\ntail -f [path_and_name_of_logfile] - you will see the output in the terminal as the log file itself is appended to.\nN.B. [path_and_name_of_logfile] is the parameter, so to give an example:\ntail -f /var/log/messages\nIf you combine with the -n [number_of_lines] option you can start the output from the last [number_of_lines] in the file - for example\ntail -n 10 -f /var/log/Xorg.0.log\n\n\nSome programs will periodically change their log file, moving the old one to a new name (e.g. log.0) and starting over.\nN.B. logrotate does this to log files for other programs that don't do it themselves.\ntail -f will continue to follow the old file after it's renamed. \ntail -F will follow the file by name, so will switch to follow the new file. \n\nA: While tail is certainly the usual way to do this, it should be noted that less has the same feature and is sometimes more usefull.\nIf you opened a file with less then you can press Shift + F to have it follow the file (i.e. it will display new lines, just as tail -f does). You can exit this mode with Ctrl + C\nYou can also start less with the +F option, in which case it will start in that mode. Generally speaking + can be used to give \"keyboard-commands\" to less which it will execute upon startup.\nUsing less for this has the advantage that you can easily search the file or view other areas if the need arises. I've frequently done that with log files, for example.\n\nA: I think ccze is the right tool for you.\nIt does same thing of colorize. You can watch log scrolling down, but it is easier to read, because lines are printed with colors (errors in red, and so on). You can quickly try it with something like this:\ntail -f /var/log/syslog | ccze\n\n", "Q: PHP scripts are being downloaded from localhost instead of displayed When I view http://localhost/ in Google Chrome, it tries to download the homepage as a file, and doesn't display it.

So you went off, installed php5 and mod_php5 (and various other php packages) then tried again and it failed, again, but now http://127.0.0.1 works! This is simply a caching issue.

Which will offer several sound profiles, based on the abilities of the sound device itself. Of those, we should at least choose one of those that mentions a sound input: \"Analog Stereo Output + Analog Mono Input\" is working for this case but you may have 4.0, 5.1 Sound profiles plus Analog Mono Input.

Most speaker will work as a very bad microphone.\nIf you don't get anything, probably your input is not working or ubuntu didn't recognize it. If you get some input, the microphone is dead (usually the case).\n(obs: you can also test your mic on another machine or device if available)\n\nA: You must mute one of the audio channels for the microphone, either the left or right one.

When i reboot system it start again and again the same auto turn off mode. \nHow can i now remotely using SSH turn it off forever?\nIMPORTANT:\n- KIOSK (ATM machine will use this option)\n- 24/7 advertising display/slides will use this\n\nOptional Note: this guide i followed  http://v2kblog.blogspot.com/2008/08/disabling-monitor-power-saver.html , but permanent solution did not worked.\n\nA: The solution to the screen blanking problem is simple once the right option is found.  This has to do with power saving, but it isn't in an obvious place.\nIn 12.04 Gnome go to:\nApplications > System tools > System Settings.\nSelect Brightness and Lock.\nUncheck the box for Dim screen to save power.\nNext to the Turn screen off when inactive for option, select the amount of time before the screen is turned off. I selected 1 hour. Never is one selection that is available.\n\nA: This will work.  Open terminal in the /etc/xdg/autostart directory.\nIssue this command:\nsudo -H gedit nodpms.desktop\n\nHit enter, you will have to input your password.\nGedit will open, copy and pasted the following code in and then save.  \n[Desktop Entry]\nType=Application\nExec=xset -dpms\nHidden=false\nNoDisplay=false\nX-GNOME-Autostart-enabled=true\nName[en_US]=nodpms\nName=nodpms\nComment[en_US]=\nComment=\n\nIssue this in the still open terminal:  \nsudo -H gedit noscreenblank.desktop\n\nHit enter, you will have to input your password.\nGedit will open, copy and pasted the following code in and then save.  \nExec=xset s off\nHidden=false\nNoDisplay=false\nX-GNOME-Autostart-enabled=true\nName[en_US]=noscreenblank\nName=noscreenblank\nComment[en_US]=\nComment=\n\nClose the terminal.\nOpen the file browser and navigate to the etc/xdg/autostart directory.\nEnsure that the files, nodpms.desktop and noscreenblank.desktop are there.  If so, close everything and then reboot.\nAfter reboot you can run an xset q command in terminal and see that dpms and screen blanking are turned off.\n\nA: #!/bin/bash\nexport DISPLAY=:0.0\n\nif [ $# -eq 0 ]; then\n  echo usage: $(basename $0) \"on|off|status\"\n  exit 1\nfi\n\nif [ $1 = \"off\" ]; then\n  echo -en \"Turning monitor off...\"\n  xset dpms force off\n  echo -en \"done.\\nCheck:\"\n  xset -q|grep \"Monitor is\"\nelif [ $1 = \"on\" ]; then\n  echo -en \"Turning monitor on...\"\n  xset dpms force on\n  echo -en \"done.\\nCheck:\"\n  xset -q|grep \"Monitor is\"\nelif [ $1 = \"status\" ]; then\n  xset -q|sed -ne 's/^[ ]*Monitor is //p'\nelse\n  echo usage: $(basename $0) \"on|off|status\"\nfi\nSave this script in something like /usr/bin, give it a name (like switch_dpms) and make it executable with chmod 664 /usr/bin/switch_dpm.\nNow all you need to do is add it to a cron job. So open your crontab file with:\ncrontab -e\n\nand add this at the bottom:\n@reboot /usr/bin/switch_dpms off\n\nEvery reboot it will turn dpms to off and you can also turn it on from commandline by doing /usr/bin/switch_dpms on or check its status with /usr/bin/switch_dpms status.\nSource for the script\n\nA: The previous answer will not work.  If you open a terminal and issue: xset q you will see that dpms will be enabled.  The easiest way I have found to solve this issue is by going into the startup applications and create 2 applications.  The name you give them does not matter, the 2 commands you need are this: xset s off (this disables the screensaver) and xset -dpms (disables dpms).  I wish that I new which config file to put these commands in, but I do not.\n", "Q: Allowing Flash to access the clipboard I use cacoo.com that is developed in Flash (a tool to make diagrams).\nRunning it in Windows works fine. But in Ubuntu, it seems that it can't access the system clipboard, blocking actions like Ctrl+Z or Ctrl+C,V, etc., which I believe need to access the system clipboard.\nSo, how can I give permission to Flash to be able to do that? I think that would fix the problem.\nI'm running Ubuntu 11.04, and I just installed it. Firefox is the latest version. Adobe Flash plugin version 10.\n\nA: This is a limitation of Firefox (I'm not sure why they do not allow it). Try using Chrome.\n\nA: If flash has access to the clipboard, then a web page can for example capture passwords being copied from lastpass.  Allowing webpages access to the clipboard is really not something you want to do.\nThere are ways to make this safe.  Eg if it's the browser that accesses the clipboard, and it generates an event when you hit ctrl-v, and then passes the clipboard content to only the page, flash app, or whatever that has the keyboard focus, then that's reasonably safe.  If flash initiates the collection of clipboard content though, then that's dangerous.\nI'd be wary of any browser or operating system that allows flash access to the clipboard.  Not that it can't be done safely, but I'd want to check on the details.\n--\nreply to comment below:\nGiven that the OP specifically refers to ctrl-v and ctrl-v, you're probably right. If it was a paste button in flash, that would definitely be a sign of a security issue though.\n", "Q: Why is Ubuntu's clipboard so hit and miss? I find that a lot of the time if I copy some text for example and then close the window being copied from, the paste function does not paste anything.\nI've noticed this in Ubuntu 9.04 right up until present version. Is there a work around for this? Is there any reason why the developers are not looking into this?\n\nA: You may want to review the Ubuntu Wiki's article on clipboard persistence, as it discusses the problem and how to get around it using clipboard managers.\nThis issue also happens to be a well-known, 7-year-old bug on Launchpad. If you have a Launchpad account and feel like it, you can go there and mark yourself as affected, though I wouldn't expect it to get fixed anytime soon. This comment on the bug explains why it exists from a technical standpoint.\n", "Q: How do I check how much physical RAM I am using in GB or MB format? How do I check my whether my Ubuntu is 32-bit or 64-bit and whether or not it is using full RAM?  I'm concerned that because my system is 32-bit it isn't using the maximum OS-supported RAM. It says my PC has 8GB RAM, but how do I verify it is using or detecting this as 8GB RAM?\nRegarding Sotanaht's answer: the System Tab shows Release 11.04 (natty), Kernel linux 2.6.38-11-generic-pae, Gnome 2.32.1 .\nFollow up: \nAfter finding my answer. Because I have 8GB hardware RAM, I don't want to be restricted to 4GB RAM, therefore removing my 32-bit Ubuntu 11.04, and downloading 64-bit Ubuntu 11.04 (so that my applications can utilize full hardware RAM too, specially for 3D animation rendering, image processing, video editing) \n\nA: PAE means your kernel is 32-bit but it's configured to use Physical Address Extension so the whole OS can use all your physical memory. The limitation of PAE, however, is that no application alone can use more than 4Gb of memory.\nSee the wikipedia article for more technical details\n\nA: If you open System Monitor (System > Administration > System Monitor) and go to the \"System\" tab, the number after \"Memory\" should correctly display your computer's ram in GB\n\nA: Sergey is right that PAE means you're running a 32-bit version.  Another very easy way to see what version you have is to open a terminal window and type:\nuname -a\n\nIn my case it returns:\n~$ uname -a\nLinux hotdog 2.6.38-11-generic #48-Ubuntu SMP Fri Jul 29 19:02:55 UTC 2011 x86_64 x86_64 x86_64 GNU/Linux\n\nSo the kernel is 2.6.38-11-generic, and the version of Ubuntu is x86_64 (or 64-bit).\nHowever, a great way to get all sorts of information is to install System Profiler and Benchmark.  It's in the Ubuntu Software Center and will likely become one of your favorite ways to get information about you system.

I checked couple of different character sets(Javanese), its showing up the same boxed hexdecimal values.\n\n\nA: Obviously your font has no support for this codepoint. The site FileFormat.info is a good resource to find information about Unicode characters and fonts. If you look up the Lydian letter G (U+10922), you'll find some general information. Furthermore there is a link »fonts that support U+10922«. Here you find 4 fonts which support this lydian letter. I chose as an example Quivira. You can download the TrueType font file (.ttf).

I have installed Webex and its plugging sun java 6k and another utilities, following the next indications: \nhttp://goinggnu.wordpress.com/2010/05/13/webex-in-ubuntu-10-04-lucid-lynx/\nApparently, webex works very fine; if you test it from the webex main page:\nhttp://www.webex.com/test-meeting.html\nIt says \"Congratulations! your system is now set up properly ...\". We must remember it is a simulated procedure.\nWhen I used by first time my system, in a real environment (in a course CCNP video-conference in real time), the video is fine, and the audio is fine. However, when I open the microphone, the audio vanish (they do not ear me, and I don't ear them) and by consequence I need to restart the application, so no opportunity exist for me to talk, but, if I subsequently open and close the microphone, I already do not ear the conference, so I need restart the webex and by consequence I loss minutes very importants.\nIn all the applications(i.e. skype, msn, etc) no problems exist with the audio. Only I have this problem with webex, so probably it's is any mismatch with the software webex or java with the ubuntu 10.04, as far as I know. So apparently the webex in my system is fine, but in order of the problem, above, it means a low and poor performance.\nI have made all the available updates (synaptic, repositories, etc), and I have cleaned the system with BleachBit, so no I do not have any manner to test the system; the only opportunity that I have is waiting the next conference session, but it is critical moment, you know.\nMy question is, what is the problem and/or what can I do?\n\nA: A first step to diagnose this would be to start the application from console, something like \njava -jar WhateverTheNameOfTheApp.jar\n\ntry to use it and see what messages are printed when the error occurs. \nThis may be a bit tricky to do if the only opportunity for you to test the application is in the real meeting call.\nSince it's a paid application, I would imagine contacting the support would be a good option too.\n", "Q: Will the switch to Wayland fix not being able to paste from closed windows? I have recently read about how Xorg is to blame for the infamous bug in which a user cannot copy and paste from a window after they have closed it. And I also know about the planned eventual switch to Wayland as a replacement for X.\nIf this bug is a result of X, and X will be replaced by Wayland, then is it possible that a fix will come at that time? I'm curious as to whether this is technically possible, and if it's currently in the plans for it.\n\nA: Well, I don't think it's a bug as such, it's rather a feature which has some unintended consequences :) Moreover, my understanding is that other \"clipboard managers\", i.e. in Windows and MacOS X, work in a very similar way - when Copy operation is performed, the application just notifies the clipboard manager - \"hey, I've got something\" without passing the actual data (although in the above mentioned OSes an application can physically store data in the clipboard - XWindow leaves this to a \"clipboard manager\", which is a separate application).\nThe reason for this will become clear if you consider that the data copied often needs to be converted from one format to another before being pasted. Example: you're copying a text frame from a publishing program and paste it into the same program - the result preserves the text frame size, borders, transformations etc. Then you paste the same thing into a text processor - the result is some text with rich formatting but obviously the text frame properties are lost because the text processor knows nothing about this. Then you paste the same thing into a text editor - the result is just plain text without any formatting.\nNow, how does it work? How does proprietary data format of the publishing program is getting converted to something which the text processor understands or just to plain text? Obviously, the conversion can't be done by the X server because it knows nothing about all the possible data formats, also, the receiving application can't do the conversion for the same reason.\nMy understanding of the process is that when something is copied, the application notifes the clipboard manager about the formats in which it can provide the data: \"hey, I've got something which I can convert to my-proprietary-format, rich text or plain text\".\nOther application then checks if there's anything in the clipboard in a format which it understands:\nif (clipboad.contains_data_in_formats(\"image\", \"rich text\", \"plain text\")) {\n    enable_Paste_menu_item();\n}\n\nThen, when Paste action is selected, the end result is that the source application is asked to provide the data in the required format.\nWhen the application is exiting, the standard says it can save the data in the clipboard manager:\nIf a client needs to exit while owning the CLIPBOARD selection, \nit should request the clipboard manager to take over the ownership \nof the clipboard, using the SAVE_TARGETS mechanism. If there is no \nclipboard manager, or if the SAVE_TARGETS conversion fails, the \napplication should simply exit.\n\nSo, my understanding is, it's responsibility of the application to save the data. As such, it's probably unlikely Wayland will improve anything in this respect :)\n", "Q: Problems streaming UPNP/DLNA from Ubuntu machine I've set up both mediatomb and minidlna on my ubuntu 10.04 PC.

Can anyone explain why this is and whether I can stop it?\n\nA: oneiric now has support for multi-architecture packages. So, even though you are using a 64-bit system, you can now install 32-bit packages on it. Earlier, this was not possible.

I see duplicated packages in the list with aptitude (lol I just tried to tab-autocomplete that!) but not with [the new] muon in Kubuntu 11.10 (oneiric) which appears to hide this.

Or you can use VNC server controlled with shell scripts. and you can always configure vnc's xsession in such a way that on startup it automatically starts opera. \n\nA: It's a bit unclear to me what you want to do, nor why your webbrowser is involved. Do you want to run skype on pc2 from pc1? In that case you can setup an ssh server on pc2. If the remote user logs in using ssh pc2 -X, he can use skype on pc1.\n", "Q: Dedicated GRUB2 Partition and Windows 8 Ok so as many of you may know the Windows 8 developer preview was released today and as such I'm very eager to use it but I have both Ubuntu and Windows 7 installed on my machine. I don't want to disturb these drives and have recently set up a dedicated grub partition on /media/sdb8\nMy question is if I install windows 8 will it overwrite the grub partition and if so what are the steps I should take to recover it.\n\nA: Windows 8 will not overwrite your boot partition (/media/sdb8) if you you specifically tell Windows not to do so during the installation process (hard disk setup where you select which partition to install C: drive on...). But Windows 8 will overwrite your MBR, as far as I know. So, once Windows 8 is installed, you will not be able to boot into Ubuntu; even though you will still be able to boot into Windows 7.\nTo fix this problem, you will need the same version of the Ubuntu LiveCD from which you had installed Ubuntu. Using the LiveCD, you can fix the MBR to show a boot screen to select Windows 8, 7 and Ubuntu. The detailed instructions can be found here: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Grub2#Copy_LiveCD_Files.\nI am listing them here for convenience.\n\n\n*\n\n*Boot the LiveCD Desktop.\n\n*Open a terminal by selecting Applications, Accessories, Terminal from the menu bar.\n\n*Determine the partition with the Ubuntu installation. The fdisk option \"-l\" is a lowercase \"L\". sudo fdisk -l or sudo blkid. The device/drive is designated by sdX, with X being the device designation. sda is the first device, sdb is the second, etc. For most users the MBR will be installed to sda, the first drive on their system. The partition is designated by the Y. The first partition is 1, the second is 2. Note the devices and partitions are counted differently. Example: the MBR may be installed on /dev/sdb and the Ubuntu partition may be on /dev/sdb3.\n\n*Mount the partition containing the Ubuntu installation: sudo mount /dev/sdXY /mnt. Example: sudo mount /dev/sdb3 /mnt. Note: If the user has a separate /boot partition, this must be mounted to /mnt/boot. Since you have a separate boot partition (which contains grub - /media/sdb8 - you will need to run the following command as well: sudo mount /dev/sdb8 /mnt/boot. Note: If the user has a separate /home partition, this must be mounted to /mnt/home. Encrypted home partitions should work.\n\n*Run the grub-install command as described below. This will reinstall the GRUB 2 files on the mounted partition to the proper location and to the MBR of the designated device. If you are using 10.04 or 10.10, then run sudo grub-install --root-directory=/mnt /dev/sdX. Example: sudo grub-install --root-directory=/mnt /dev/sdb. If you are using 11.04 or 11.10, then run sudo grub-install --boot-directory=/mnt/boot /dev/sdX. Example: sudo grub-install --boot-directory=/mnt/boot/ /dev/sdb.\n\n*Reboot into the Ubuntu installation on your hard disk.\n\n*Refresh the GRUB 2 menu by typing the following command in your terminal: sudo update-grub.\n\n\nNOTE: As answered by Steve, \"Windows 8 uses the new Protogon file system\". Grub does not have support for this file system (yet!). Once this support comes, you can use Grub to boot into the Windows 8 bootloader. Until that time, as suggested by jart, use a separate hard disk to hold the Windows 8 partition and it's bootloader. This way, even the Ubuntu hard disk MBR will not get over-written. Unplug the Ubuntu hard disk when you are installing to the Windows 8 hard disk. Once the installation is complete, plug the Ubuntu hard disk back in, boot into the Ubuntu hard disk (by setting it in the BIOS boot sequence) and follow the steps which I have outlined above.\n\nA: Watch out - Windows 8 uses the new Protogon file system and Grub can't find it.\nThis means that when you put grub back - you lose the ability to get into Windows 8\n\nA: If money is not a problem, then buy a new hard drive and install windows 8 in that one. That way you will have ubuntu and windows 7 in one, and windows 8 in the other hard drive. You will have to boot windows 8 from the bios though, but you won't have to worry about messing up windows 7 or ubuntu. Before you install windows 8 remember to first unplug the hard drive containing windows 7 and ubuntu. One's you install windows 8 in the new drive re-plug the hard drive containing window 7 and ubuntu.\n\nA: I'm guessing most people finding this question will find it AFTER having already b0rked their bootloader.  I installed Windows 8 on a totally separate disk, and planned on re-installing grub after as usual after doing something hokey with Windows.  Re-installing grub wasn't sufficient fix my boot menu, unfortunately.\nSo after fixing grub per ubuntu's instructions, I ran\napt-get install startupmanager\n\nin terminal, ran the startupmanager application, and it found the appropriate menus.  Closed it, rebooted, and everything worked.\nPlease note that using the shutdown option from the Windows 8 menu actual hibernates, so in order to boot back into Linux after hanging out in Windows 8 you'll need to use the restart option, or run the following command in terminal to fully shut it down.\nshutdown /s /full / t 0 \n\n\nA: When you install Windows, Windows assumes it's the only OS on the machine—or at least it doesn't account for Linux. So, it replaces GRUB with its own bootloader.\nWhat you have to do is to replace the Windows bootloader with GRUB. Simply chroot into your install and run update-grub.\nHere's how: How can I repair grub?

What if I wanted the computer to connect to the network without me logging in so I can log in remotely?\n\nA: Presumably because the network manager uses user specific network settings located in that user's home folder. The global network settings go into /etc/network/interfaces, which is a common way to set up networking on CLI servers.

Thanks\n\nA: The short answer is: file the bug in Launchpad, using ubuntu-bug, against any relevant package. Filing a good bug, even if it's against the wrong package, is still useful: it's easy for someone better placed to redirect it in to the right one, and much easier than dealing with a bug that doesn't have a stacktrace or other technical information.\nAs far as which package it should go against:\n\n\n*\n\n*Filing against one application that does show the problem is a good place to start.\n\n*Choosing the package corresponding to the innermost stack frame that's not really generic like libc would also be reasonable, so (just going off what you show here) libpixman could be reasonable.\n\n*The file dialog for gedit comes from libgtk2 (or maybe libgtk3 depending) so that could also be ok.\nThis stack trace looks truncated so getting the actual right one by reporting with ubuntu-bug would be much better.\n", "Q: What is the easiest way to do multi party video conferencing Whats the best way to:\n\n\n*\n\n*create a video conference that can handle at least 4 people. \n\n*stream your desktop to be viewed by multiple people in the conference. \n\n\nA: Faceflow offers a four way video conferencing.\nhttp://www.faceflow.com/video-conference\n\nA: Google+ Hangouts supports this.\n", "Q: Chromium keeps crashing I was clearing the cache/temp internet files from chromium, and did a silly thing, while it was still clearing, I close chromium too quickly...\nNow when I try to clear the cache/temp internet files, chromium just disappears.\n\nA: Chromium settings are stored in ~/.config/chromium. it could be that some of these files are corrupted. Deleting the chromium-folder will reset the settings/state of chromium to that of a fresh install. You will lose all your bookmarks and settings so make a backup of that folder first.\n\nA: As an ademdun to Kenneth Venken's answer, there is a way to preserve a large quantity of your browser data, including bookmarks and settings. Open up the Chromium preferences menu and click on the 'Personal' tab.

These are available through launchpad and should really be used for testing new software.\nOne such PPA I found is this one by Daniel Pfeifer.  \nPlease see this question which explains the purpose of the PPA from its author.\nYou should note - some people have found several issues with the use of this PPA.

When I plug it in and unplug it a few times, it stops complaining, and runs for hours. Is there a way I could fix this, or even just tell Ubuntu to ignore a critically low battery?\n\nA: You can tell Ubuntu to ignore it by opening gconf-editor, then go to /apps/gnome-power.manager/actions/critical_battery and change it to nothing.  \n\n\nA: I suggest trying to let your laptop battery drain all the way (you might need to turn off the auto-suspend) and then letting it charge all the way up, all while running Ubuntu. It's often hard to know a battery's \"empty\" and \"full\" states without having some kind of measurement, and if this calibration is way off, then the percentage will be way off as well.\n", "Q: Why does Ubuntu One android not sync video I have U1 android client and have auto-upload photos on.

The problem is any phone capable of running android (ie smartphone), not only takes photos but video as well. How do I get my video to sync with cloud as well as photo?\n\nA: We are only syncing pictures at the moment because the API the Android client uses has not been yet optimised for large files (mostly it doesn't support resuming failed uploads).\nBecause videos are on average much larger than pictures, we've started off with pictures.\nMaking our APIs support uploading large files is something we have on our plates to fix, so you should eventually see support for video added.\n\nA: The app FolderSync claims it can do it.

What kind of recent graphics card can I run under Ubuntu 11.04 64-bit?\n\nA: Taken from Ubuntu Documentation\nUbuntu's support for graphical interfaces is determined by the underlying support found in X.Org's X11 system. Most AGP, PCI and PCIe video cards work under X.Org. Details on supported graphics buses, cards, monitors, and pointing devices can be found at \nthis link. Ubuntu 11.04 ships with X.Org version 7.5. \n\nA: The latest cards from ATI (HD 4000 and up) and nVidia (GeForce 8 series and up) all work great with proprietary drivers under 64bit ubuntu, and work reasonably well with open source drivers. Older cards, or certain embedded cards, from nVidia or ATI seem to work much better with the latest open source drivers than they do with proprietary drivers. Intel integrated graphics and some others out there are also very well supported by open source drivers.\nIn short, the graphics card driver support in 64bit Ubuntu looks pretty much the same as graphics card driver support in 32bit Ubuntu and is pretty good all-around. You'd be hard press to find a card that you can't get decent performance out of with either a proprietary driver or an open source one.\n", "Q: Can I have a single login for multiple machines? I've got three identical machines for my 3 kids, running Narwhal, but I'd like to replicate the user accounts across all 3 so anyone can login on any machine without me having to create all accounts on all 3 machines.  \nIdeally, this would include storing their home directory stuff on a windows server (or one of the 3 machines), and replicating their desktop settings, etc.  The windows server is all set up, samba's running, I can map it, etc.  I just haven't bothered yet because I didn't want to replicate the same work 9 times.

I am using Ubuntu 11.04 and do not know how to compile and execute C++ program in it. I need to know the commands to Compile and Execute a C++ program in Linux. \n\nA: This is how I like to compile with g++.\n\n$g++ -W -Wall -pedantic -o programName -p sourceFile.cpp\n\n-W: Print extra warning messages for some problems.\n-Wall: Enable all the warnings about questionable code\n-pedantic: Show all the warnings demanded by strict ISO compliance\n-o programName: place the executable output in programName sourceFile.cpp: the \nname of our source code file\n-p: Generate extra code to write profile information suitable for the analysis program prof\n\n\nA: I'm making two assumptions here:\n\n\n*\n\n*You already have a C++ source file/program ready to build\n\n*You have set up a build system on your computer\n\n\nThe simplest way to compile a C++ program on Ubuntu, or any other Linux distro for that matter, is to type\ng++ main.cpp -o main\n\n\n\n*\n\n*g++ is the invocation of the C++ component of GCC, the defacto compiler for C/C++ and whole host of other languages on the Linux platform. It's currently the only compiler capable of compiling the Linux kernel.\n\n*main.cpp is the c++ source file you wish to compile.\n\n*-o main specifies the name of the output file you wish to create once the source is compiled. The target source file and the target output file can be inverted if you wish, so g++ -o main main.cpp is equally valid.\n\n*To then execute that program, you need to do ./main in the terminal.\n\n\nThe above commands assume you are already in the location of the source files, but both the source file and target output file may also be specified as a directory. For example\ng++ ~/Desktop/main.cpp -o ~/Projects/main\n\nwill compile a C++ source file located on your desktop and place the executable binary in a Projects folder in your home directory. To run this executable, run ./Projects/main.\n\nA: To compile your c++ code, use:\ng++ foo.cpp\n\nfoo.cpp in the example is the name of the program to be compiled.\nThis will produce an executable in the same directory called a.out which you can run by typing this in your terminal:\n./a.out\n\ng++ should already be in your $PATH, so you don't need to call /usr/bin/g++ explicitly, but you can use the latter in any case.\nfoo.cpp should be in the same directory you're running the command from.  If there is any doubt, you can make sure you are in the same directory by typing ls foo.cpp or head foo.cpp (if you need to verify you're working with the correct foo.)\nAs noted by @con-f-use, the compiler will usually make this file executable, but if not, you can do this yourself (so the command to execute, ./a.out or equivalent, will work):\nchmod +x ./a.out\n\nTo specify the name of the compiled output file, so that it is not named a.out, use -o with your g++ command.\nE.g.\ng++ -o output foo.cpp\n\nThis will compile foo.cpp to the binary file named output, and you can type ./output to run the compiled code.\n\nA: You need g++, for gcc may not compile cpp file easily.\nYou also need to learn vim or emacs to write C code.\nJust try this on your terminal:\nType a test program and save it:\n$vim hello.cc\n\nCompile hello.cc with g++:\n$g++ hello.cc -o hello\n\nExecute it:\n$./hello\n\nHere the ./ means the exe file is under the current dir.\n\nA: g++ is a front-end to gcc(GNU Compiler Collection) with some predefined c++ macros and different default options/flags.  \ncompiling c++ code with gcc is handy when g++ is not available for any number of reasons ,in fact it's just a matter of linking to the c++ library -lstdc++ and informing gcc to treat the input as c++ code (either by using a .C extension , or forcing the language with -x)\nother valid c++ file name suffixes : .cc , .cp , .cxx , .cpp , .CPP , .c++ \nexample :\ngcc cpp_code.C -lstdc++    the uppercase extension (.C) is important for gcc to know it's a c++  file. \nor explicitly specifying the input language :\ngcc -x c++ cpp_code.txt -lstdc++ extension can be anything, or even nothing\nby default the result (after a successful compilation) is an a.out file which can be run with ./a.out\n", "Q: Growl-type messages in Ubuntu I'm working on a Python application that runs in the system tray and displays notifications to the user in the form of popups. It uses Growl on Macs and Growl for Windows on Windows. I've tried notify-send in Ubuntu, but it won't display a new message until the last message displayed goes away. Sometimes, I need to display 2 messages in quick succession, so that's no good. What else is out there that I could use?\n\nA: Rather than using the external notify-send, I suggest you use the pynotify library, and then you can append to existing notifications and the bubble will grow.\n", "Q: Change the window manager unity-2d launches on login As opposed to this question, I'd like to change the window manager that unity-2d launches when logging in.  IOW, when I select a \"Unity 2d\" session at the greeter screen and log in, I want to change things such that a different window manager is launched instead of metacity.\nNeither setting  the:\n/desktop/gnome/applications/window_manager/default\nnor the\n/desktop/gnome/session/required_components/windowmanager\ngconf keys seems to make a difference.\nHow can this be done?

However the Unity 2D session defines metacity as the window-manager and ignores the relevant gconf keys you listed.\nIf you look in /usr/share/gnome-session/sessions you will see the different sessions defined for the benefit of gnome-session. \nYou can create a new session. For example, here is mine, called 2d-ubuntu-compiz.session:\n[GNOME Session]\nName=Unity 2D with Compiz\nRequired=windowmanager;panel;filemanager;\nRequired-windowmanager=compiz\nRequired-panel=unity-2d-panel\nRequired-filemanager=nautilus\nDefaultApps=gnome-settings-daemon;unity-2d-launcher;\nFallbackSession=classic-gnome\n\nYou could also change the line to\n    Required-windowmanager=gnome-wm\nwhich should then respect the gconf keys for the window manager.\nThen all you need is to tell the logon manager (gdm) about your new session. Create a new file in /usr/share/xsessions. Here is mine, called unity-2D-compiz.desktop\n[Desktop Entry]\nName=Unity 2D with Compiz\nComment=This session logs you into Unity 2D\nExec=gnome-session --session=2d-ubuntu-compiz\nTryExec=gnome-session\nIcon=\nType=Application\nX-Ubuntu-Gettext-Domain=unity-2d\n\n", "Q: How can I change the Hidden Attribute of a file/folder? (Alternative to attrib FILENAME -h) On a MS Based system (Windows, any versions) You can use the attrib command in order to change the attributes on a specified file, directory or directory with recursively changing the files inside the directory also, the command may look like:\nattrib FOLDERNAME -s -r -a -h /S /D\n\nWhich will remove any attributes to a specified FOLDERNAME including the files/folders inside of it.\nWhen a Virus modifies these attributes to the files/folders in a removable device (USB/SD Memory/HDD) in order to hidden them from the user, I use my Ubuntu OS Based computer and plug the device in the appropriate slot and I can see all the files/folders and manually remove the undesired items on the device.

This is what I'm doing when I log into a FTP:\nftp user:password@server\nftp: user:password@server: Unknown host\nftp> echo HELLO WORLD!\nftp> quit\n\nI'd like to do a one-line FTP command...\nftp user:password@server -command \"echo HELLO WORLD\"\n\nor\n\"echo HELLO WORLD\" | ftp user:password@server \n\nSomething similar... as part of a script I'm trying to create. Nothing is getting transferred, I just need to echo some instructions and this is the easiest way I've found to do it between two of my systems.\n\nA: That really is more of a job for SSH (as others have pointed out), but if you're determined to use ftp, try lftp.  It's freely available for all currently supported versions of Ubuntu. You can install it with the command  sudo apt install lftp\nlftp -u username,password -e \"your command;quit\" ftp.site.com\n\nlftp documents a -c switch that runs the command and then quits, but it appears to be broken in most distributions.  -e will keep you connected unless you issue a quit.\n\nA: I found this thread when I was searching for a way to have a single ftp command execute a file transfer from this machine to the ftp server.  Here is how:\nCreate a file with the ftp commands in it: (call it 'ftpcommands.txt')\n open YourFtpServer.com\n user YourUserName YourPassword\n put localfilename remotefilename\n bye\n\nThen run the ftp command and feed the file into it:\n ftp -n < ftpcommands.txt\n\nThe -n option keeps ftp from trying to log in automatically when it receives you 'open' command.\nHope THAT helps someone.  I couldn't find anything online that was this solution, so I had to figure it out myself.\n\nA: You can't use FTP for executing commands remotely. It stands for File Transfer Protocol. What you actually need is SSH.\nAll you need to do is install the package ssh on both machines and then follow this guide to set up password-less logins. \nAnd now how to call it:\nssh username@host echo \"Hello World\\!\"\nFor example, this is me doing it to myself:\nnick@AccessDenied:~$ ssh nick@localhost echo \"Hello World\\!\"\nHello World!\n\n\nA: Complementing @charlesbridge answer, include in your ~/.bashrc file the following:\nalias yoursite=\"lftp -u <username> -e \\\"<commandA;commandB>\\\" yoursite.com\"\n\nSource the file:\nsource ~/.bashrc\n\nNow use the alias \"yoursite\" to logon and execute as many commands as you would like.\n\nA: Install busybox using:\napt-get install busybox\n\nbusybox can work on Linux or embeded system both, then use ftpget and ftpput\nbusybox ftpput -u USER -p PASSWD URL_FTPSERVER FILE_U_WANT\n\nbusybox ftpget -u USER -p PASSWD URL_FTPSERVER FILE_U_WANT\n\n\nA: Let's assume for the time being you are a hobbyist user or are doing this in a sandpit fashion.\ncurl() can be used for FTP, even to transmit.\nwget (wput) also.\nand there is ncftp (for background asynchronous transfer) and lftp.\n.netrc is a good idea, even from root.\nBut your \"echo\" is disturbing. If you want easy remote commands install putty-tools and use \"plink\". There is also \"pscp\" if you would care to check it out. Professionals may decry these tools, but they are great for your home network, cron jobs, and quick scripting.\nThese are SSH tools, and can be as powerful as formal products such as Ansible. They require an SSH server, and open ports to reach it, and possibly identity credentials. I apologise if if SSH is off topic for you, the type of script seen in the popular answer by Jack is often seen in sftp transfers (note the \"s\").\nAs an aside, you can run CGI like commands from FTP, but this is not generally spoken of, nor publicly encouraged. It involves watching for the transmitted file or using a write only \"dummy\" file on a customised server.\n(Arcane example follows).\nIn the \"TK4-\" distribution of MVS3.8 on the Hercules (now Hyperion) mainframe emulator, remote job entry is effected by FTP transfer to the file AAINTRDR which stands in for a card reader to read the \"cards\" in your file.\n", "Q: Help!

And i believe - in physical - it is the best way to make such systems human-compatible -- maybe you should take a deeper look at the measurements of pcmcia-compactflash-adapters if you doubt it (ever thought of credit- and identity-cards and endurance of memory?)\nIn hope i made your heads stumble and i am earning constructive response on this request, i leave with best regards to all of you who think of it before denying.\n\nA: *\n\n*Install Windows first on the S-ATA HDD. It will install it's bootloader to the MBR.\n\n*Then, when installing Linux (preferably Ubuntu!), select the following setup for the partitions:\nA. Select / partition to be on the Compact Flash Drive. Use the entire drive.\nB. Select /boot partition to be on the S-ATA HDD. Also, the linux bootloader must be installed to the MBR of the S-ATA HDD. This is because the bootloader searches the same hard disk, on which it is installed, for GRUB (i.e., /boot partition).\nC. Select swap partition to be on the S-ATA HDD. Swap partition should be twice as large as your RAM size. So, if your machine has 4 GB RAM, ten the swap must be 8 GB. This will allow you to hibernate your machine when required.\nD. Select /home partition to be on the PCMCIA Compact Flash Adaptar. NOTE: The /home partition is only mounted when a user logs in. Otherwise, just switching on the machine will not mount the /home partition (access on demand).\n\n*After this is done, continue with the installation. At one point, you will be asked to create the Administator user. At this point, you can also opt to encrypt the /home partition. Do so. Now, your /home partition will be encrypted.\n\n*Finish the installation. And you are done!\n\n\nNOTE: I have asked you to install Windows first because it will over-write the MBR and it does not detect Operating Sytems other than Windows versions. So, your install Windows first and then install Linux. Linux will detect all other Operating Systems and it will allow you to choose which Operating System you want to boot, like Windows, Mac or Linux.\n\nA: Thank you very much for your precise instructions, rigved.\nThat's what i thought of (due to my knowledge and experience) originally and therefore i fully agree with you and thank you for stating it here, but there was a problem in any attempt i made (up to Ubuntu 11.04, since 8.04; versions before worked right that way); \nThe problem was/is, that install runs fine, first start of system after setup initializes correctly and then after another reboot it seems to lose binding of the /home partition if it is placed on the PCMCIA/PCCARD CompactFlash. I found out that something was changed over versions, which loads the necessary driver later. So i asked how can it be that it does the job when booting right after install. I found out, that (maybe due to my settings, i don't know) it boots into a root or sudo state then, because of unattended upgrades and creating folders and files and their rights customized to the locale settings.\nMaybe you have further thoughts on this? I would appreciate it.\nOne 'solution' i found was switching to real-time kernel or using the ubuntu studio flavor in version 10.04 which makes use of it, too it seems and then boot into rescue mode constantly instead of normal boot, because then it boots right into /root and it is possible to start gdm/lightdm/xdm and then login graphically to the encrypted /home of the user; but that also has limitations. It only works with the first generated user (semi-administrative/pseudo-root/first-user/administrator) or if i setup the other users in a second CompactFlash-Adapter and give them administrative-rights manually from the logged in first-user-account and also setup a group which has to be the same on any accounts that should be used from pcmcia.\nWell, you see, i experienced a lot and i have had the feeling all the time, that i don't see what's clear and right in front of my eyes. Or maybe it is really that hard to accomplish the task? Then maybe, there is a way to automate this procedure?\nHowever i will give Ubuntu 11.10 another try with the setup-directions you spend.\nThank you very much for your effort.\nIf you have other options or knowledge where the failure in my doing can be found, please, feel free to cut it to pieces and give me advice.\nThank you.\nClaudius Raphael Paeth, A3lyphe\n", "Q: How do I use my PC as a Public Address system I have a set of external speakers for my pc which work very well.

Must I always open gufw did I simply need to enable it once?\nThank you.\n\nA: Good questions.\n\nAside from those apps, updating regularly, and downloading from trusted sources only, should I be taking any other precautions?\n\nNot really.  Don't run random commands, especially those mentioning sudo, that people might give you on the web, unless it's a trustworthy source or you know what it does.  \nBeyond that I think the main thing you want to be careful with is web security, eg not typing your facebook password into random other web sites.\nUpdate rigved wisely suggests installing security-oriented browser plugins:  Adblock Plus, HTTPS Everywhere, Noscript and WOT.  (rigved also says Tor, but I'm not so sure about that, because Tor has major security risks that make it a bad default for most people.)\nUpdate2 Do not use the WOT browser plugin, as it has serious privacy concerns: https://thehackernews.com/2016/11/web-of-trust-addon.html . Thanks to DJCrashdummy for pointing this out.\n\nMust I do anything more with gufw other than checking enabled or are the default settings (incoming : deny, outgoing : allow) sufficient?\n\nThat should be fine.\n\nDo I have to manually turn on gufw everytime and enable it (and keep it open)?

I am just wondering can wubi 11.04 make windows unbootable in anyway and what harm can it do to my PC. Also, if I force shut down in wubi ubuntu can it damage windows?\n\nA: WUBI is pretty safe: it creates one file on the Windows disk, and new boot menu entries, but doesn't change partitions.  You should always be able to boot back to Windows, and an abrupt shut down might corrupt the Linux filesystem but nothing outside of that.\nNothing in life is entirely without risk.  You should, as always, have backups.\nThe main kind of risk that Wubi mitigates is needing to repartition, or reinstall, or to install a new boot sector.  Those aren't very risky, but they can be hard to undo if you   instruct the installer to do the wrong thing (eg to delete Windows) or if you change your mind.\n\nA: Wubi can harm your PC as every program can and can not.\nThe most serious damage for a common desktop PC is a harddisk-failure, which can occur independent from your OS. So you need a backup.\nAnd if you have backups, nothing can really harm you.\n\nA: Wubi is the safest way to have a second OS without having to make irreversable modifications.  I have yet to see a noticable difference between a Wubi install and a native partition.  The downside is that it requires Windows for Ubuntu to operate.  A native partition is the better option, because if Windows crashes, you can boot-up to a working operating system.\n\nA: Yes\nUbuntu is very powerful and it makes it easier to take control.  You can just as easily be productive as destructive.  Windows (or a Mac) are designed with many more precautions that make it harder to accomplish basic tasks, but harder to hang yourself.  With Ubuntu, you kind of have to know what you're doing to a much greater degree than if you're using a commercial OS.\nI probably did damage to the file system of my \"safe\" computer, the one I use for backups because it has a RAID 1 disk configuration.  I didn't know that RAID is not supported by Ubuntu.  Maybe I missed it somewhere, but I tried reading about the install for hours before I actually did it, and I didn't find out about this unsupported configuration until after I had done the damage and was searching through the help.\nThis OS definitely gives you a lot of power, but it could also give you just enough rope to hang yourself!\n", "Q: How to move VLC window by clicking on video?

Now, obviously, nothing works :(\n\nA: This is a known problem of S10-3. You probably installed it through a USB Stick and had to add several grub commands.

Reboot your machine and test if mongo is running typing:  sudo service mongod status\n\nA: If you have installed the MongoDB Community Edition (which is the recommended way since it receives more frequent updates than the package distributed in the Ubuntu package repository) you configure the start / stop behaviour of mongod via the upstart init script /etc/init/mongod.conf, which defaults to start the daemon automatically on boot\nstart on runlevel [2345]\nstop on runlevel [06]\n\nIf you do not want it to start automatically, replace those 2 lines with\nstop on runlevel [023456]\n\n\nA: If you install MongoDB using the Advanced Packaging Tool (apt) then it'll configure your startup scripts to automatically run Mongo when the system boots.\nThe steps are as follows, first configure apt to be able to download the Mongo package:\nsudo apt-key adv --keyserver keyserver.ubuntu.com --recv 7F0CEB10\nsudo nano /etc/apt/sources.list\n\nAdd this line to sources.list then save:\ndeb http://downloads-distro.mongodb.org/repo/ubuntu-upstart dist 10gen\n\nThen download and install Mongo with the apt-get utility:\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get upgrade\nsudo apt-get install mongodb-10gen\n\nIf you want to make any changes to config, edit your mongodb.conf and restart: \nsudo nano /etc/mongodb.conf\nsudo service mongod restart\n\n\nA: You can use systemctl command to enable your mongo service at run at system boot.\nCreate a service such that\nsudo nano /etc/systemd/system/mongodb.service\n\nPlace content in the file\n[Unit]\nDescription=MongoDB Database Service\nWants=network.target\nAfter=network.target\n\n[Service]\nExecStart=/usr/bin/mongod --config /etc/mongod.conf\nExecReload=/bin/kill -HUP $MAINPID\nRestart=always\nUser=mongodb\nGroup=mongodb\nStandardOutput=syslog\nStandardError=syslog\n\nafter that you will be able to use service commands like\nsudo service mongod start|stop|restart\n\nand then if you want to make it up at machine boot, you can create mongod file under /etc/init.d/\n\nA: chkconfig --levels 235 mongod on? \nwhere mongodb is the name of your service\n\nA: If you install MongoDB with apt-get as described in the MongoDB Ubuntu installation guide, it will come with a basic startup script and config file.

A \"revelation\" you might say. I use a Radeon 3450 HD myself, streaming video over Gigabit LAN on a 2.4GHz 2GB RAM media-PC. I suddenly realised, out of the blue, that VLC is set to default video output, meaning X11/XVideo, but the card is capable of using OpenGL. So, I changed the output to OpenGL, saved the Preferences, restarted just to be sure that was the output used. Besides bad coding, skipped frames in the original recording, not the machine skipping frames, the video output has been stable, fluid and without artifacts. Just a tip to try if you have the possibility.\n\n\nA: http://www.thefanclub.co.za/comment/reply/118\nThe best way to install AMD catalyst latest or beta minus all the hard work.\n", "Q: Either blank screen during boot or poor resolution console in Ubuntu Server within VirtualBox I'm setting up a test platform in VirtualBox, the host system is Ubuntu Lucid Desktop, and the guest system is Ubuntu Lucid Server.\nThe basic server installation provides 80x25 console with slow scrolling and slow screen updates. This has been fixed by blacklisting vga16fb. After that I got 80x25 console with quick screen updates and scrolling.\nThen I tried to disable splash screen and quiet mode by editing /etc/default/grub, removing splash and quiet default boot parameters from GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT. After that I got boot messages quickly displayed during the boot on 80x25 console.\nThen I tried to set up higher resolutions in console. I provided a desired graphics mode in /etc/default/grub file with GRUB_GFXMODE parameter, and set GRUB_GFXPAYLOAD_LINUX parameter to keep to keep the graphics mode persistent in console. After that I have a desired resolution in grub menu, desired resolution in console, but the boot messages between grub boot line selection and login screen are now invisible (black screen).\nHow to configure grub and console so that all parts of the boot process - grub, boot messages and console login - are visible in a desired resolution console?\nUPD: Things go better once I provide fbcon module for initrd: edit file /etc/initramfs-tools/modules and add a fbcon line there, then rebuild the initrd by issuing update-initramfs -vu. All as root, of course. After that I started to see boot-up messages, first of them saying Console: switching to colour frame buffer device 128x48. However, some of the boot-up output goes into different console mode (like fsck messages), and I see the screen switching there and back again. But still that's much more than blank screen.\n\nA: It is probably a better idea to run a vm-server in headless mode and console into it, having any terminal width your guest can manage. There is a virtualbox-headless command for the purpose. You can set up a stty in the guest and redirect boot messages to the same stty by a kernel command line in grub, like:\nBOOT_IMAGE=/boot/vmlinuz-3.0.0-10-generic root=/dev/sda1 ro console=ttyS0,38400n8 vt.handoff=7\n\nthen, in the host, copy /etc/init/tty6.conf to tty8.conf and replace the line \nexec /sbin/getty -8 38400 tty6\n\nwith:\nexec /sbin/getty -8 38400 ttyS0\n\nFinally configure the image to output serial0 to /dev/pts on the host. (This works good with kvm, it should also go with virtualbox)\nAnyway, if you don't like this approach, install the guest additions. Then you should be able to achieve higher resolutions. The slow scrolling comes from the fact that the vga16fb is indeed 16-bits color info per pixel and the poor console has to transform each pixel to the 24 or 32 bits of your hosts X11 and monitoring pixel changes isn't trivial, so if you somehow can increase the color depth to match your hosts, scrolling should speed up.\n", "Q: How do I fix a shutdown problem?

Don't know if it's in the oficial repositories, but it's here:\nhttps://launchpad.net/~danielrichter2007/+archive/grub-customizer\n\nJust search all the burg related packages and install them on synaptic. If you have any problem, uninstall it and reinstall grub.\n", "Q: How to exclude previously deleted files from a new rsync copy? Extending on this question:\nAutomatically sync a folder to a USB when USB is plugged in?\nI do not want an automatic script but just a small bash script to do the following:\n\n\n*\n\n*Copy current ~/Documents/ to a backup folder\n\n*Copy newer files from USB/Documents to ~/Documents/\n\n*Copy and carry over deletions from ~/Documents/ to USB/Documents/\nI now have:\n# Backup local:\nrsync -av ~/Documents/ ~/backup20112012/Documents/\n\n# Synch new files from USB:\nrsync -auv /media/20CC-A5E5/Documents/ ~/Documents/\n\n# Sync and delete USB:\nrsync -av --delete ~/Documents/ /media/20CC-A5E5/Documents/\n\nwhich works with one exception. If I delete a file in ~/Documents, it is created again in step 2 (cause it is on USB). Is there a way to omit copying files that have been deleted in step two?\n\nA: Your requirements are a little strange. It looks like you want to synchronize ~/Documents and USB/Documents so that they have the same content. If that's so, use unison , which is the tool of choice when you're looking for a bidirectional rsync.\n\nA: If you want to delete all files that are on the USB that are not on the PC then I believe you can do this:\n# deletes any files that are on the USB that are not on the PC and synchronizes any files that have been changed more recently on the PC then on the USB.\nrsync -auv --delete ~/Documents/ /media/20CC-A5E5/Documents/\n# synchronizes files that are newer on the USB then on the PC\nrsync -auv /media/20CC-A5E5/Documents/ ~/Documents/\n\nBy having the first command use -u, you should not overwrite any files that are on the USB and the PC, and by using --delete you will delete all files that are on the USB that are not on the PC.\nThe second command then synchronizes the USB with the PC.\nThe one downside to doing this is that ANY files that are on the USB and are not on the PC will be deleted. This is what you want I think though. If you create any new files on the USB that are not on the PC the new files on the USB will be deleted. If you delete any files on the PC they will be deleted on the USB.\nFrom what you want I don't think this will suffice, but it is the most you can do with RSync. \nIf you wanted to just delete files on the USB that were DELETED on the PC, and NOT delete files on the USB that were never on the PC, then you would have to create some sort of program that would log every time you deleted a file on your PC, and then only delete those from the USB. Which is probably a lot more complicated and more work than you want to put in for this.\n", "Q: Ubuntu One refuses my 11 character login Okay, I go to register in Ubuntu One. Everything looks good.

When I tried to install from it, I've got a kernel panic just like here, except for the version number (mine was 2.6.38-8-generic #42-ubuntu). My ISO image seems to work, as I installed it into a VMWare player without problems. Booting Linux from USB works surely too, as I did it some time ago with an older Ubuntu version.\nI can imagine things to try out, e.g., write the image again, try another version, pray, look for patches, etc. However, I'm looking for a time-efficient solution, something what most probably works. An advice of the sort \"wait two weeks until it's surely fixed, then download again\" is acceptable, I'm determined to switch to Linux, but it can wait a bit.\n\nA: Regarding the USB Installer issue. What is the overall capacity of the USB stick that you're trying to use? I ask this because I've been fiddling with this issue for the past three or four hours trying different things. And finally I think I've come up with something. \nThen I started thinking about the File Systems and how it's logic works when determining the difference between a USB Flash Drive and a USB Hard drive. So with my 5gb USB Stick everything worked out cherry. Then going through the same exact steps and attempting it on my 16gb USB stick I would get the \"Panic!\". \nEven though when mounting a USB device, whether or not it's a flash drive or a external hard drive, is referenced by the user the same way the way the File System manages the amount of space has to be different (especially when your trying to use Fat32). Try mounting it on a smaller partition something ~5gbs or so. I tested this on 5 different larger USB sticks and 5 different smaller (under 8gb) USB sticks and the results stuck all the way through. \nLet me know if you end up testing this out. Because I had this problem for a while with multiple different distro's (Google the kernel panic with any distribution, Gentoo, Ubuntu, Fubuntu, Mandriva, Puppy.. Pepperment... you get the idea). So I've, in my own mind at least, ruled out it possibly being the developers. \n**EDIT**\nWanted to confirm all the USB devices that I used to attempt a FROM USB (five total) that I used them with that, after creating a smaller (4gbs is what I decided to go with) partition for the installer to be placed on all the devices that failed now work without an issue.\nSoftwares tested: Lili Live USB Creator, Pen Drive Linux, Unetbootin, & dd linux consol tool.\n**EDIT**\nFederico Cinelli\nCINELLI Motorsports LLC\nStay true.\n\nA: I have not successfully used a usb installer yet, but there is another way: install directly to the usb drive. I can't tell you exactly what you need to do (since I can't look at a live cd for reference right now), but basically you boot into a live cd, then use your usb as the \"hard drive.\" This is an option somewhere in the advanced intsall options, but you won't see a thing that says usb. It will just show the name of your flash drive. \nI'd unplug your main hard drive before you do this, in case you make a mistake.\nI hope this helps!\n\nA: Doing a full install to USB, (as above), will not give you the Ubiquity installer needed to install from the USB, unless you install Ubiquity CD Installer from the Ubuntu Software Center.\nIf Universal installer doesn't work for you, try Startup Disk Creator from the Live CD or extract usb-creator.exe from the Ubuntu iso* or try Unetbootin. I have heard of many people having problems with Universal.\n*7zip is a good tool for opening iso files.\n", "Q: How stable is the Ubuntu One nightly build ppa? I am using ubuntu 10.04 so it is an older version of ubuntu one and had no control panel. I noticed there is a lucid version in the nightly build ppa and was wondering how stable it is\n\nA: The nightly PPA is an automatic build with no testing - at best packages either compile or dont compile on a daily basis.  I would stay clear of this PPA.\nMy suggestion therefore would have been to install either ubuntuone-control-panel or ubuntuone-control-panel-gtk - the latter package gives you a GTK type interface for Ubuntu-One.\nHowever these packages are only available for Maverick and Natty.  They have not been backported to Lucid.  There is one potential PPA available with these packages backported.  However, as the author himself says - use with care.  Therefore - take the authors advice and backup first using a good backup tool such as Clonezilla\nTo Install on Lucid\nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:kalon33/experimental-stuff\nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:ppa:kalon33/ppa\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get install ubuntuone-control-panel-gtk\n\nNOW VERY IMPORTANT\nOpen your software sources and untick both the Kalon33 experimental PPA and Kalon33 PPA.

I can't afford an operating system, so I'm thinking of going with the free Ubuntu instead of pirating one. How would I go about doing this? Can anyone link me to a tutorial for this? Will it work the same as getting it onto a computer with an operating system?\n\nA: If you know how to install ubuntu beside windows or another OS you should be fine to install ubuntu as the only OS. The only challenge I can imagine could be, that the HD is not formatted at all. To solve this challenge, boot into the live session, either from usb stick or cd, and use gparted to format the drive, either fat 32 or ext 4, after this install ubuntu and hopefully if the hardware is supported everything should work fine\n", "Q: What is a script and how do I write one? There are a couple of times I have been presented with some codes as solutions to problems. My question is how do write these type of scripts myself for some fairly routine tasks?\n\nA: There is number of scripting languages available. The most common under Linux might be Bash, Phyton and Perl. They all have their advantages and disadvantages. It is a very vast field. For starters I'd recommend the Bash Guide for Beginners to learn how to automate routine tasks. Bash is ideal because it is present in almost all Linux distributions and often even the default shell - when you learn bash scripting you also learn how to use the shell very effectively. So that's a plus with Bash. Personally I like Perl the most.\nWhat all scripting languages  have in common is that you write a regular text file containing commands. These files are called scripts A script file should start with a line specifying the interpreter of your choice  language (i.e. the program that executes the command in your text file). An example for this line would be this:\n#!/bin/bash\n\nThat tells your computer the following lines are bash commands to be executed with bash shell. What the available commands are can be learned in the various guides.\nOnce you have written that file, you need to make it executable. Say your file is named foo.sh than this line in a shell would make it executable:\nchmod +x foo.sh\n\nAfter that you can run the script typing:\n./foo.sh\n\nhitting ENTER afterwards. A very easy example for a full script would be:\n#!/bin/bash\n# This script prints \"Hallo world X\" five times\n#+where 'X' is a number from 1 to 5.\nfor i in 1 2 3 4 5; do\n    echo \"Hallo world $i\"\ndone\n\nAnd that's how I wrote and executed it in gnome-terminal, which is the default graphical terminal in Ubuntu:\n\n", "Q: How long does wubi take? How long does wubi take (not to download) but during the install after the windows reboot? For me it should be a short download (about 10 min) but how long will it take after?\n\nA: Well this is a rather strange question since the answer has too many variables. The \"normal\" time should be between 5 to 15 minutes. I say normal when I talk about computers with 2GB RAM and a CPU around a Core 2 Duo. Normal in this time of technology. But some variables that will change the time it takes to install (Since the download depends on the connection) are:\n\n\n*\n\n*CPU You are using - Slow CPU, slower install. Not much slower, but slow nevertheless.\n\n*Memory you have - This one affects A LOT how long it takes. The less memory, the more it takes. 512MB or more is good.\n\n*Hard Drive - Does not affect as much as CPU or RAM but it affects anyway. If you have like a Quantum Fireball 4GB Hard drive Pata 5400RPM (Like in THIS year!!) then that is going to take more than for example a Hitachi 1TB F3 7200RPM Sata2 64MB Cache + French Fries.\n\n*Motherboard - This puppy is up with how much RAM affects the install. If you have some horrible motherboard (The cheap ones you get in a happy meal) it might look like ages. If you have some pure Intel, Asus, MSI, etc.. motherboard that is known to give power when needed then you are good.\n\n*Installation Unit - Are you using a Pen Drive to install it, an ISO right from the windows Daemon Tools. a CD/DVD from a good or bad/old cd-rom/dvd-rom drive, are you doing it from the network... you get my point. This also affects the speed and overall time.\n\n\nFor cases I had a slow install that took me 35 minutes on a Pentium 3. The fastest was on a Core i7 from a friend who I invited to Linux and that took 3 minutes (I went to the bathroom and when I got back it was done).\nAlso remember that what options you select in the install. It is not the same to install Ubuntu selecting all 3rd party hardware drivers, packages, etc.., and updates than to not select them at all. Installing ubuntu with everything selected will take a lot of time, not the 35 minutes I mentioned but more than an hour.\nSo like I said, a lot of variables.\n\nA: It takes about the same amount of time to install as it would to install Ubuntu on its own partition. This obviously depends on the speed of your computer, hard drive and Internet connection.\nWubi just mounts a large file within your Windows partition as its own Ubuntu partition and ensures that the boot loader can remount it every time you boot into Ubuntu. Apart from that, its pretty much the same as a standard install.\n", "Q: How to setup multiple partitions I have a Google Cr-48 notebook. The SSD only has 6 gb that I am comfortable allocating to Ubuntu. I need to move /usr to an external HDD. I also will move my /Home to another partition on the drive. I am going to specify the requirements that I must meet.\n\n\n*\n\n*I CANNOT install Ubuntu again\n\n*I CANNOT use LiveUSB or LiveCD or LiveDVD\n\n*I CANNOT boot the entire OS from the USB Drive\n\n*I CANNOT do anything that requires GRUB (GRUB IS NOT INSTALLED OR UTILIZED, TRUST ME I AM CERTAIN)\n\n*I CANNOT boot into Recovery Mode (reboot recovery or pressing button as both require GRUB) at all\n\n\nI want to know if it can be done and how it can be done in detail. I have tried this many times. Each time something new went wrong.\nI am asking for assistance on how to do something, I don't want anyone saying \"moving the /usr directory is a bad idea\" or anything of that nature. If I had another option that I felt comfortable with I wouldn't be asking this question. \nAny assistance that anyone could provide would be greatly appreciated. I will provide more details in the future if requested/required. I am sorry for my pessimism, but after 5 re-installs my patience grows a little thin.\nThank you!\n\nA: Please read my response to your previous question - how to recover from mounting /usr/ nosuid - moving /usr to a mounted partition is not only \"a bad idea\" but is going to result in silent failures unless you also modify your initrd image, because /usr is expected to be available during the early boot process before any non-root partitions are mounted.\nApart from that, there are no major problems with moving /usr - all you need to do is\n\n\n*\n\n*copy files from /usr to a separate partition\n\n*modify /etc/fstab\n\n*issue mount /dev/sdb1 /usr (where /dev/sdb is your \"separate partition\")\n\n\nThat's it, you should be using the new /usr now. Note that the files in your root /usr partition are not removed - this may require some trickery because /usr unavoidably becomes unavailable for a moment, but all commands required are located in /bin so it looks like it might work. Actually, I tried mounting /usr to a separate partition on a throw-away Virtualbox instance and it worked fine:\nmkdir /usr.new\nmount /dev/sdb1 /usr.new\ncp -rp /usr/* /usr.new/\numount /usr.new\nnano /etc/fstab # added a line /dev/sdb1 /usr ext3 relatime,errors=remount-ro 0 0\nmv /usr /usr.old\nmkdir /usr\nmount /usr\nrm -rf /usr.old\nsync # flush disk caches just in case it hangs up during the shutdown\nreboot\n\nAnd that should be it!\nOn my test box I found no issues with failing usev rules, but then again - it's a Virtualbox instance, YMMV.\nUPDATE: I'm finding that sudo stopped working on that box, complaining on suid bit not set - this was caused by me using cp -r instead of cp -rp, as was suggested in the comments\n", "Q: What does \"Missing Operating System\" on boot mean? So I've got my new computer now, one without any operating system. I have my ubuntu all ready on a USB, it's plugged into the computer. I turn on the computer, it shows a splash screen, then it goes to the black with white text mode (maybe called terminal?) and says \"Missing operating system\".\nWhat do I do?\n\nA: If you're getting this error it means you haven't booted off the USB stick, or the USB stick isn't bootable so when you try to boot off of it, it fails.\nDouble check that you've created the USB stick correctly, and then ensure when you boot the PC that you select to boot off of the USB stick.\nThis setting differs between PCs, but usually hitting F2, F12 or Delete on boot let's you either set the setting in the BIOS or select it right from boot.\n", "Q: Migration from ecryptfs to full-disk encryption I'm thinking if I should move from the ecryptfs $HOME encryption to a full-disk encryption. What is the most recommended tool I can use for this full-disk encryption, and what is the best tutorial available on how to migrate from ecryptfs? Free and open source a big plus.\nI know those are technically two questions, but the 1st question is just an opening to the 2nd.\n\nA: My recommendation would be to backup all of our data and re-install Ubuntu using the alternate DVD and select LVM Encryption. This will encrypt all of the contents of all of the partitions that are part of your LVM. You will be required to enter your passphrase before the system is booted, so once your system is in that state it is no longer encrypted.\nI would then supplement this with the use of TrueCrypt for encrypting the contents while the system is fully booted. I'm including a link to a Ubuntu community document that outlines how to install it and it should guide you to its basic use.\nSo why am I recommending two encryption solutions? \nLVM Encryption - This will protect your system from theft if the machine is lost or stolen while in a powered off state. \nTrueCrypt - This will protect your data while the machine is powered on.\n*Caution: As soon as you decrypt any of the filesystems by mounting them they are at that point in cleartext. There is no way around this and you still need to exercise good security practices such as least privilege, strong passwords, firewall rules, etc.. *\nTruecrypt Ubuntu Community Documentation\nUbuntu LVM Encrypted Filesystems Howto\n", "Q: Upgrading Ubuntu with encrypted $HOME I've heard cases of people who had problems with ecryptfs-encrypted $HOME when upgrading their Ubuntu versions. Is there any truth in that, and if yes how to upgrade without problems?\n\nA: I have an encrypted HOME, and I have upgraded through to Oneiric without much trouble related to that.  ecryptfs does have bugs like everything else, and they can be a bit alarming, but there's nothing special about upgrading.  Upgrade away.\nThe main thing is that you should make at least one reliable backup of the unencrypted contents of your home directory.  You can encrypt the backup, for example by using Deja Dup, but that's separate and ought to be OK even if ecryptfs is broken.\n\nA: The known upgrade issues with Encrypted Home were fixed by the 10.04 LTS release several years ago.\nUbuntu 9.04 and 8.10 put the encrypted data in /var/lib/.ecryptfs, which was, perhaps, an acceptable place to put this data, per the FHS.  However, there were a few users who took care to partition their hard drive with /home on a partition of its own, and then chose to encrypt their home directory.  Some of these users proceeded to reinstall (rather than upgrade), and expected their /home partition to persist their encrypted data.  Sadly, that data was actually located in /var/lib, and it got wiped.\nI published a migration rune here.\n", "Q: Is making a clean install enough to remove potential malware? Is formatting the disk and reinstalling the system from scratch (to Ubuntu) enough to remove any potential hidden software spyware, keyloggers etc.? \nOr can something still persist installed in the bios or something like that? What to do then?\nTo be clear, not concerned about malware. The question is more specific about a machine to which people other than the user had physical access for many hours. So when the user returns cannot be sure nothing changed. So the user makes a fresh install after some weeks. Is that enough to \"clean\" it?\n\nA: Malware cannot usually be installed in the BIOS (it is read only), and also Ubuntu is not very open to malware (it should be the least of your worries, to be honest, and that issue has been covered on this site before).\nIf you did get malware however, reinstalling (so long as the contents of the affected directory are not preserved) would work. However, you should not even have to go this far, as often times, simply deleting or replacing the affected files should fix it.\nSomeone having physical access gives them a lot of power over the system, but it highly unlikely for them to put anything in your BIOS, so just a reinstall of the OS should be enough.\n\nA: It is very unlikely that you'll have malware installed in hardware. Actually, you can't do that at all in Linux, which is why we need to use DOS to flash BIOS. It may have been possible for someone to corrupt your BIOS by using MS-DOS or similar, but it isn't likely. If you're really paranoid about it, then you can re-flash your BIOS. \nBut it is very easy to corrupt an Ubuntu system if you have physical access to the computer, so a reinstall is quite reasonable if you are suspicious. That will remove at least all system-level malware. It is still possible to add a script to be run by a user in order to spy or similar, but that should be fairly easy to find. \n\nA: Just a few more observations to take into account:\nThe would-be attacker could also get hold of your (email, banking etc) passwords (or other sensitive/personal data) if you stored them unencrypted on your disk.\nIt is possible and fairly easy to install and use a hardware keylogger or similar devices, for an example see\nhttp://www.keyghost.com/kgpro.htm\nIf you don't reinstall the Grub code in the first few sectors of the disk, malware could potentially survive there.\n\nA: Although quite new, UEFI is quite insecure and an os in itself, therefore a rather new security threat. If someone would be able to temper with a server or laptop physically to upload a modified UEFI, you could reinstall the system all you want, without any positive effect. \n", "Q: Enabling Nvidia Graphics on Ubuntu 11.04 I've been struggling this for quite some time and it's come to a point where looking at my screen hurts my eyes because I think my video driver settings are all messed up. \nAdditional Drivers says I have NVIDIA accelerated graphics driver but they are \"not currently in use\" (Screen shot below).

Back in Windows land, it was only Chrome and IE and few other softwares that used IE's internal proxy settings. I'm interested to know how does it work in Ubuntu/Linux in general?\nOften just setting the HTTP_PROXY environment variable would be caught by the program, it seems to me, but it is all that open network-proxy does ? Can softwares neglect this setting, by making direct connections? Is it actually up to them to decide ? Or if once I set a system wide proxy setting, it re-routes everything ?\n\nA: System wide proxy settings are just another consolidated place for proxy settings. It actually modifies the places where different apps' config files. Have you noticed, system wide proxy setting asks for password 2 times? This is mainly because of the modification of two admin files which corresponds to config file.\nAnd yes, from 10.10 and 11.10, some apps have been left out of system wide proxy setting most notable among them is the synaptic.\nand moreover, apps can bypass the system wide setting and make use of their own setting again most notable synaptics and Mozilla Firefox(which contains system settings option as well).\n\nA: It is up to the programmer if his software uses proxy settings.

I am using Ubuntu 11.04 Desktop and when I right click on a particular folder and select \"Open With Other Application....\", some of the applications are repeated multiple times. This is happening with more than one application. I was able to get rid of them from the \"Edit Menu\" option, but why does this happen and how to make sure it doesn't happen again?\n\n\nA: (For the solution, skip to the bottom. I'll explain some technical details in case it's useful to someone trying to understand why it happens.)\nThe problem is that there are multiple .desktop files for that program with different filenames in applications directories.\nIn Ubuntu, applications directories are:\n~/.local/share/applications\n/usr/share/applications\n\nFor example, on my system, there are three entries for Banshee in /usr/share/applications/:\n/usr/share/applications/banshee.desktop\n/usr/share/applications/banshee-audiocd.desktop\n/usr/share/applications/banshee-media-player.desktop\n\nwhich results in three entries for Banshee in the Open With Other Application... dialog.\n\nOne solution is deleting the extra .desktop files, but that could break opening other file types (for example, banshee-audiocd.desktop is used to open audio CDs).\nThe right solution is adding a Hidden=true line to these duplicate .desktop files in /usr/share/applications/. However, I don't recommend you do it because it requires messing with system files owned by root (this fix should be there by default).\nSo, what can you do until this is fixed in Ubuntu?\nSolution\nRemember I said with different filenames in the beginning? That's because .desktop files in ~/.local have higher priority over system-wide .desktop files with the same name. So, copy the entries you want to get rid of from /usr/share/applications to ~/.local/share/applications and add Hidden=true to them.\n\nProblem solved!\n\n\nA: As to why it happens, I'm not 100% sure. Sometimes it happens with WINE applications due to some difficulties in setting up the .desktop files and the appropriate associations.\nIt is a known problem however, and it hopefully should be fixed in the near future.\nTo solve the problem for yourself, remove the duplicate entries in: ~/.local/share/applications, and it should be fine. Most of the time when you do this once you won't have to do it again until you reinstall the application in question.\n", "Q: Why don't the Function Key options and play/pause/volume work on a Mac Bluetooth Keyboard?

On the laptop keyboard and bluetooth keyboard I can use the extra function keys (volume, play, pause etc) as expected. And I get page up/down with Fn+Up and Fn+Down and start/end with Fn+Left and Fn+Right.\nThe other day I purchased a 2nd Apple bluetooth keyboard for use at work. It appears the same, although perhaps some upgraded components (my 1st one is ~2 years old).

After installation, just run sudo evtest and choose the right device corresponding to your keyboard. Then, just press the function keys and check whether there are any events being generated. \nIf you see any events being generated, note the names and codes of the keys. If they are obvious ones like KEY_VOLUME_UP or similar, then I'm afraid I can't help.

Is there a way to boost the overall sound? THank you for your time.\n\nA: Using Pulse Audio Control (pavucontrol):\nYou can choose to increase just the volume of the browser\n\nor the system volume\n\nTo install this tool, go here or do\nsudo apt-get install pavucontrol\n\n\nInstead of/beside that: youtube videos can be played in external players that can boost the volume:\n\n\n*\n\n*SMPlayer's Youtube Browser (smtube) can search and play youtube content.\nYou can edit main SMPlayer toolbar to add the specific button or open from Options.\n\n\n\nThen, in SMPlayer (according to this answer) go to SMPlayer Preferences/Audio, check \"Use software volume control\" and increase the maximum amplification.\n\n\n\n*\n\n*VLC can be used to play youtube video as indicated here, and this player can boost the volume up to 125%.\n\n\n\n\nA: You can try typing pactl -- set-sink-volume 0 100% in terminal and change 100% to your desired boosting percentage.\nThe 100% is the default unboosted volume; you can boost it by changing it to 200% for example.\nIf it doesn't work then try typing pacmd list-sinks; you should see a list of \"sinks\" with numbers. Change the 0 in the command to the sink number of your speakers.\n\nTo boost the level (let's say to 150%) without using the terminal every time, one can create a .desktop file with this content (considering that the sink number mentioned above is zero):\n[Desktop Entry]\nName=vol_150\nComment=Change sound volume and sound events\nExec=pactl -- set-sink-volume 0 150%\nIcon=multimedia-volume-control\nTerminal=false\nType=Application\nStartupNotify=true\nCategories=GNOME;GTK;Settings;HardwareSettings;X-GNOME-Settings-Panel;System;\n\nThat can be used as a desktop launcher, can be added to the menu using a menu editor or can be launched with an application launcher (like Synapse launcher) after having copied that .desktop file to ~/.local/share/applications or to usr/share/applications.\nTo get a similar launcher in order to go back to 100%, use this, in the same way:\n[Desktop Entry]\nName=vol_100\nComment=Change sound volume and sound events\nExec=pactl -- set-sink-volume 0 100%\nIcon=multimedia-volume-control\nTerminal=false\nType=Application\nStartupNotify=true\nCategories=GNOME;GTK;Settings;HardwareSettings;X-GNOME-Settings-Panel;System;\n\nSuch files need to be made executable. \nIf Pulse Audio Control (pavucontrol) is installed, changes made using the solution(s) above will be reflected by this tool.\n\n\nA: When you click on the Volume icon in the menu (top-right corner), you'll see a drop-down. Click Sound Preferences. The master control of the volume is present there and you can boost your volume above 100% there.\n\nA: Your Audacious audio volume is fine, therefore the audio problem comes from the web browser. It's not an audio driver problem, nothing to do with PulseAudio or ALSA whatsoever.  \nThere is a solution for boosting audio in Firefox. You can type 'about:config' in the address bar and search the strings containing the word 'volume': media.volume_scale. The default value is 1, but you can increase that to whatever you may see fit.  \nIf you don't like all the Firefox config stuff, you can install this extension: https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/default-media-volume/?src=userprofile, which does the exact same thing.  \nIf you're using Chrome, try this solution: https://superuser.com/questions/840643/volume-low-in-chrome-browser.\n", "Q: Nautilus \"unable to mount \" and \"not authorized\" and LightDM keeps sending me back to login screen on shutdown and restart \nPossible Duplicate:\nCan't mount filesystems and computer won't shut down \n\nUsing Nautilus I can't get my internal or external volumes to mount and get \"unable to mount \" and \"not authorized\" after an update of Ubuntu 11.10 beta and also I cannot reboot normally instead I need to reboot using terminal as root.

I have a very specific problem and I've been fighting Upstart all night with no success.\nI my particular case, I have a server with a bunch of PXE booted clients. The data for the clients is stored in MySQL. When I shut down the server, before anything happens, I need all the PXE clients to be turned off as well. In the old, sequential world of sysvinit this was a piece of cake: just put the remote shutdown script early in the sequence, before networking, portmap, nfs, mysql go down. This was ok even if it took 10 minutes for all the clients to go off (but usually 30 seconds would be enough).\nWith upstart I can't for the life of me get the clients to shutdown before the server. I managed to get the script executed before mysql went down, but that isn't enough, as it seems that the network and/or other support stuff that the PXE clients REALLY NEED goes down, so they NFS mounts go up in smoke and they never power off. They will power off as soon as the server is back up though.\nThe closest I got to getting what I want is this:\nkill timeout 70\n\nstart on runlevel [016] and (stopping mysql or stopping portmap or stopping idmapd or stopping statd)\n\ntask\n\nexec the-script-that-shuts-clients-down.sh\n\nThe script tells all the machines to shut down then keeps an eye on them (sending pings once a second), and only when either they're all down, or the script gets bored and gives up, should the server continue the shut down sequence.\nNow, with Upstart, my script gets killed after about 7 seconds. Even with the 70 second timeout as above.\nIdeally, I'd like to execute that script before anything else is triggered by the runlevel switch, but Google says I'm out of luck on this one. There's NO SEQUENTIAL mechanism in Upstart - even \"backwards compatibility\" rc is executed in parallel with the rest of the upstart services.\nAny ideas on this one? I'm running Ubuntu 10.10.\n\nA: I managed to solve my problem with this:\nkill timeout 70\n\nstart on runlevel RUNLEVEL=[016] PREVLEVEL=[2345] and (starting rc RUNLEVEL=[016] or stopping mysql or stopping portmap or stopping idmapd or stopping statd)\n\ntask\n\nexec the-script-that-shuts-clients-down.sh\n\nWell, almost, because it looks like Upstart has a little bug that is specific to hooking on rc. At least in Ubuntu 10.10 it does. I don't have an 11.04 at hand to confirm it.\nThe work around right now looks like this:\nIn the-script-that-shuts-clients-down.sh, before exiting I do\ntouch /etc/init/my-job.conf\n\nwhere my-job.conf contains the stuff above. So far it unstuck rc from start/starting everytime.\nAnother catch is that if I write starting rc rather than starting rc RUNLEVEL=[016] then upstart gets stuck on rc at boot too (and the same touch command unsticks it).\n", "Q: Auto-start and play mp3s from usb stick Is there a way that I could auto start a music player and play mp3s from a usb stick immediately after my computer has booted up?

Can anyone recommend a single wireless integrated keyboard and mouse (one device with both functions), that can connect wirelessly to my computer so that I can navigate, type and do all the functionality I have with 2 wired devices?\n\nA: You can fairly easily use a laptop, if that's interesting to you. It's actually quite easy to setup and configure. You'll install QuickSynergy (It's in Ubuntu Software Center) on both your mediacenter and your laptop and then configure the mediacenter to connect to your laptop. \nIf you're not familiar with it, Synergy lets you define another computer similar to having an external monitor. That is to say, you'll move the mouse pointer outside of the laptops screen and then you control the other PC with both mouse and keyboard. \nOne thing you should be aware of, is that the controlling PC, a laptop in this case, is called the server and that the mediacenter will be a client. Configuration is quite simple. On the mediacenter, you'll open the \"Use\" page in QuickSynergy and enter the laptops hostname in the server hostname field, and the mediacenter hostname in the screen name field. Append .local to the hostnames, so if your laptop is called mylaptop, then it becomes mylaptop.local. Click execute. \nOn the laptop, you run QuickSynergy, but this time, you open the \"Share\" page. Enter the mediacenter hostname in one of the four fields (again, this will be like mediacenter.local) and click Execute. You can now move the mouse pointer from the laptop and onto the mediacenter, and the keyboard and mouse will work as if you had a keyboard and mouse connected to the mediacenter. \nI know it's not exactly what you asked for, but it is a completely free solution as long as you just have a laptop. :)\nIt works with OS X and Windows too, by the way.\n\nA: QuickSynergy additional guide from (http://code.google.com/p/quicksynergy/wiki/RunningQuickSynergy)\nworked ok with XBMC, the screen mouse movement wasn't 100% but it was ok.

Before putting effort into configuring and trying to use a complex open source component, it is useful to have some idea as to whether bug reports or support requests are likely to get a response. I have a reasonable clue for how to do this for the original upstream source of something in ubuntu.\nHowever, when I see a version like: 6.2u5-1ubuntu1, I know that the Ubuntu dev community in particular is responsible for the package. This is particularly true if the upstream source bundle is difficult to build and thus it's clear that whoever made the .deb for Ubuntu did a lot of work.\nHow can I track the provenance of an Ubuntu debian and get some idea if the people who did it are still maintaining it? Is there some Ubuntu index that maps packages to their packagers?\nMy example of the moment is gridengine-qmon and friends.\n\nA: You can infer some things from the changelog. First off, let's have a look at the changelog in Ubuntu:\n\n\n*\n\n*https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/gridengine\nIf you click on the little expander things you'll see the Ubuntu changelog. In there for oneiric you'll see:\n\ngridengine (6.2u5-3ubuntu1) oneiric; urgency=low\n  \n  \n*\n  \n*Resync with Debian:\n  \n*\n  \n*drop setting -Wno-error, it's already done in Debian package   \n  \n*100-as-needed.diff: new patch, fixes FTBFS (LP: #770777).   \n  \n*Rebuild gets rid of binary dependency on openssl0.9.8.\n  \n  \n\nOk so it looks like last person who touched this packaged synced with Debian, which is good. Now let's look at the Debian changelog:\n\n\n*\n\n*http://packages.debian.org/changelogs/pool/main/g/gridengine/gridengine_6.2u5-3/changelog\nIt appears as though the package is actively maintained in Debian as well, so far so good. \nSince someone is actively keeping the package in sync with Debian it's probably a good indication that the maintainer is responsive. What I recommend here is to file a bug against the ubuntu package, and then outline the steps of your problem and then go from there.\nThere are other things you can do to see how active a community is around the package. For example you can see if the people who touch it post regularly on the upstream mailing list, do they send patches upstream routinely, etc. Though for me personally the changelog is usually a good enough indicator.\n\nA: In contrast to debian ubuntu packages are usually don't have their own maintainer. In reality this means that they are very close to the original debian package. This is also the case for this specific package. \nNevertheless:y ou can see on launchpad who specifically uploaded the last version.\nhttps://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/gridengine/6.2u5-3ubuntu1\nYou could also contact the debian maintainers and see if they are ready to answer ubuntu problem. Many of them will do it.\n\nA: First, this is a very difficult and potentially argumentative and subjective question.\nWith that being said, my suggestion is this:\nTake a look at the upstream project. Many of the Ubuntu packagers that I've seen are all about the packaging, not the bugs etc.\nHowever, you've got to make your own decision - one place to look at includes the launchpad project for the software.\n", "Q: How to change the search location of Unity's Music Lens with Clementine instead of Banshee?

Is there a way of getting the lens to actually read the music folder instead of Banshee's database? If not, how hard is it to create a lens to look at your music folder?\n\nA: There is currently no way to use another player besides banshee with the music lens. In order to have the music lens read from clementine, you would need to write a clementine scope. \nHelp documentation for this is available at https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Unity/Lenses#Creating_a_Scope. \nThere is sample code available at lp:unity-lens-sample, and lp:unity-lens-music is another good place to look.\n\nA: You can take a look at: http://shuffleos.com/4224/expand-scope-of-unity-music-lens-to-rhythmbox-clementine-and-guayadeque/\n\"You can install Rhythmbox, Clementine and Guayadeque scopes in Ubuntu 11.10 by running following commands in the terminal.\nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:markjtully/ppa\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get install clementine-scope guayadeque-scope rhythmbox-scope\n\nAll of these three scopes functions perfectly with the default Banshee scope of Unity music lens.

Rebooting makes the problem go away.\nHow can I find out what process is causing this issue?\n\nA: This can happen if your /etc/fstab has the following line for your cdrom:\n/dev/cdrom /media/cdrom auto rw,noauto,user,exec 0 0\n\nChange it to\n/dev/cdrom /media/cdrom iso9660 rw,noauto,user,exec 0 0\n\n, reboot and try if it still happens.\nSource\n\nA: I have been running into issue now again a few times and I am reasonably confident that it is really nothing more then having an shell open that is still in /cdrom/ and thus prevents a proper unmounting of the drive.\nStill no idea on how to find the trouble causing shell with lsof or fuser, but there is another way that should work:\nsudo ls -l /proc/*/cwd  | grep -i cdrom\n\n", "Q: ssh -X \"Xt error: Can't open display: :0.0\" I'm trying to open xterm on my remote server (Ubuntu Server 10.04) with ssh:\nssh -X name@machine xterm\n\nbut the error returned is:\nxterm Xt error: Can't open display: :0.0`\n\nI googled and tried everything I found. \nStill getting this error. The DISPLAY-variable should be set automatically, right?\nPart of sshd_config:\nX11Forwarding yes\nX11DisplayOffset 10\nPrintMotd no\nPrintLastLog yes\nTCPKeepAlive yes\n\nAny advice?\n\nA: If ssh is able to establish the connection, it will set DISPLAY to the proper value. Since you have X11DisplayOffset set to 10 (the default value), ssh will use the first available display starting at 10. If you see a value that's lower than 10¹, then something is interfering with the normal X11 forwarding set up by ssh, at least by overriding DISPLAY. The value :0 (or :0.0, the part after the dot is irrelevant) indicates the first display that was started on the machine, which in typical cases is the active session (or the graphical login prompt) on the machine's console.\nThe most likely explanation for the behavior you observe is that one of your shell configuration files sets DISPLAY. The most obvious culprit is ~/.bashrc (which due to a quirk of bash is executed whenever the parent of bash is rshd or sshd, even if the shell is not interactive). Another file that defines environment variables is /etc/environment. If that's the case, the solution is obvious: don't set DISPLAY there. (There are very few cases where you need to set DISPLAY manually.)\nThere are other exotic explanations. This might happen if you've changed your login shell to screen (a cute idea in theory, but not practical) and you have a shell initialization file that forcibly sets DISPLAY inside screen (not such a good idea). This could also happen if you configured the server to accept environment variables sent by the client (AcceptEnv directive in sshd_config), the client is sending DISPLAY, and the X connection couldn't be established. Or it could happen if you set an environment variable on the server via the command directive in ~/.ssh/authorized_keys. Or xterm could be a script.\n¹  Or whatever the value of X11DisplayOffset is in the server configuration, but it's hardly ever changed from the default.  \n\nA: Your command should work, or at least it does for me. Try this instead: \nssh -Y user@machine xterm\n\nEdit (1):\nTry this:\nssh -X user@machine env\n\nThat should show all the environment. There should be various SSH things in there, and also DISPLAY. DISPLAY should be 10.0.\nYou could also try this:\nssh -X user@machine DISPLAY=10.0 xterm\n\n\nA: As well as X11Forwarding yes, I also needed to add\nX11UseLocalhost no\n\nin /etc/ssh/sshd_config\nas described here.\n\nA: Access control of X is probably in the way.\nRun xhost + (from package x11-xserver-utils) to completely disable access control.\n\nA: I found that xauth had not been installed.\n\nA: Also, check that you have X11 installed on the client end. I was getting this issue when I upgraded my Mac to OS X Mountain Lion. Mountain Lion removes X11, so you have to install it again via the open source X Quartz project.\nhttp://xquartz.macosforge.org/landing/\n\nA: You should open first the connection,and once established open xterm.\n", "Q: Ubuntu one: u1conflict I'm running Ubuntu 11.04 and using Ubuntu One to sync my docs. I have about 500 .doc files, and I edit them constantly. I'm having problems with the appearance of .u1conflict files.\nI have only one computer synced. Please edit the following, it's incomprehensible:\nHas somehow to sync just on bootup/shudown to solve it?\n\nA: Sorry to hear that you're experiencing a misbehaviour in Ubuntu One.\nYou shouldn't have conflicts in Ubuntu One if you're using only one machine (and not touching the files through the web interface, of course). Currently we don't know about any bug about this situation if your system is fully updated (we had bugs about this).\nIf this is happening to you for files that previously were ok, we may have a bug that we don't know about! These kind of situations are very difficult to debug, so we normally ask for logs in TRACE mode.\nSo, the best way to continue with this and help us to find the reason of the problem you're experiencing is to put the logs in TRACE mode, and if this happens again, open a bug in the following URL and attach the logs there:\nhttp://bugs.edge.launchpad.net/ubuntuone-client/+filebug\nHere are instructions to put the log in TRACE mode:\n\n\n*\n\n*stop the syncdaemon client (\"u1sdtool --quit\") and be sure it's fully stopped (\"ps -eaf | grep ubuntuone-client\" should give you nothing).\n\n*put a file named syncdaemon.conf  in your $HOME/.config/ubuntuone directory with the following information:\n[logging]\nlevel = TRACE\n\n\n*\n\n*restart the client and keep it using it normally.\n\n\nTo collect the logs just zip your $HOME/.cache/ubuntuone/log/ folder.\nThanks for your time and help!\n\nA: .u1conflict files appear when the document you have on your local machine is not the same as the one you have in your personal cloud and not the one you're uploading. In that case, Ubuntu One doesn't know which is the correct version and therefore syncs all of them, but makes it obvious that there are conflicts. That way, you're never in danger of getting the wrong version. \nYou will often see this problem when you're using LibreOffice to edit documents that are stored in a synced folder. The reason is that LibreOffice saves automatically at certain intervals, while Ubuntu One tries to sync all changes. This means it's very easy for you to be in the process of uploading a document when the local document changes. It seems that LibreOffice saves the document even when no changes have been made, which makes the problem worse. \nBecause of this, I would not recommend that you work on such files directly in a synced folder, but instead have a working directory and copy your files when you need them synced. This is not as elegant as it should be, but I think it's the best way for now. Someone has proposed a plugin for LibreOffice that makes it work better with Ubuntu One, but I don't think any work has been started on that yet. In any case, we should've had a good GUI to show the conflicts and to fix them. Sadly, I don't think we have that yet either. \nSo, in summary, conflict files are good. They make sure you never loose any data, even if your internet connection suddenly become very slow, for instance. \n", "Q: DBUS Exception when using Quickly Today I wanted to test Quickly.

I replaced the 1GB(2x512MB) of RAM in it with 2GB(2x1GB). Since this upgrade the computer will switch to a text screen, with what looks like a backtrace or something. It often says something about a double fault or null pointer dereference. It does this rather unpredictably, though it tends to happen when you are trying to do something (but will still happen if you leave it long enough). It often happens with Firefox/Chromium (it could be me, but sometimes it seems like scrolling tends to cause it).

I was wondering why the software center doesn't download all the requested apps and install one by one as they finish to download.\nOr instead why the software center doesn't download an app while the other is installing\n\nA: First, let it be known that this answer is from what I've gleaned from my experiences with dpkg and apt. I haven't looked at the actual software center code to determine this.\nIt's a limit of the design of the underlying software.\nPart of the dpkg system that Ubuntu uses for packages includes a feature that \"locks\" the /var/lib/dpkg/lock file to prevent multiple dpkg (apt-get and Ubuntu Software Center are front ends) from overwriting itself and other bad, evil things. \nWhat happens when you install software? What happens is it starts sudo apt-get install chromium-browser (to use Chromium as an example).\nAnd when that happens, a lock kicks in. Once you add more than one package to be installed, what happens next is it waits until the first one is done before it starts the next apt command.\n\nA: Some actions, like refreshing the menu's, indexing fonts and reconfiguring the libraries need to happen only once if all packages are installed at the same time.\nA second advantage hopefully shouldn't happen often, but if you want to install packages which exclude eachother you know it prior to downloading all of them.\nA last advantage is mostly important when you install or upgrade many packages at once: if questions have to be answered, they will all come after eachother during the install progress. So you can keep working instead of being bugged every 5 minutes by a different question.\n\nA: That is a good question. It is because it's based on the same package tools that apt-get and others use. These are designed in a way that expects you to provide all the packages to be installed, and then the rest is automatic. This is very good in most cases, but for the Software Center, it causes some issues. You would either need to first select the packages you want to install and then click a button to actually download and install them, or you have to queue applications and then download and install one by one. This provides a much better user experience if you're installing one application than having to use those extra clicks, but it is also annoying when you're \"shopping\". \nIt is possible to fix this, so I expect that in the future, this will be remedied, but it does mean recreating or rewriting existing tools, so I don't think it'll have very high priority. \nLet me elaborate: \nA package may depend on other packages. If these packages aren't available, then the package cannot be installed. So tools like apt-get will first download all the packages you ask for and all the packages they depend on, etc, and then install all of them. So you would then normally provide all the packages you wanted in one go, and they would first be downloaded and then installed.\nWhen you choose to install an application in the software center, you'll usually want it to start downloading and installing immediately. But in order to ensure that everything is in order, only one installation can be done at any one time. That's why when you install an application, you have to wait until that application is completely downloaded and installed before the next download and install can begin. \nThis could be fixed by not using apt-get to install the packages, but instead downloading the packages manually and then using dpkg to install them once they're ready. You still wouldn't be able to install two packages simultaneously, but you would be able to start downloading new packages while the previously started installations were finishing. In some cases, that would save quite some time, so it is a good idea. But in most cases, it wouldn't really matter so the effort is better focused elsewhere. \n\nA: The reason that two instances of apt-get cannot operate simultaneously is because the application is reading/writing several files critical for the system operation. Reading or writing a file by an apt-get operation, while another is performing the same operations on it will lead to problems of bad configuration and/or damage of the files. So when an apt-get operation occurs, it \"locks\" the files it needs so another operation cannot be executed simultaneously, a.k.a. it raises a flag that tells the other operations that the files are currently in use.\nHowever, simultaneous downloads of the files needed by apt (or rather download from a number of sources) are possible with the command apt-fast\nhttps://github.com/ilikenwf/apt-fast\n\nA: you can only install one package at the time with sudo apt-get install, but you can install several packages with one command. Like this:\n\n\n*\n\n*sudo apt-get install ubuntu-desktop lubuntu-desktop\nThis will install both ubuntu-desktop and lubuntu-desktop and whatever dependencies they require, in the correct sequence.\nAlso when you update your system with sudo apt-get upgrade, you first download all the software and then install one package at the time. \nThe reason\nWhy you can't install several packages at once is that only one instance can use the apt-get privileges at the same time. This is because apt-get locks on the software sources and blocks any other command from using them. \nAn example \nLet's say that you somehow starts 2 separate apt-get as @Rinzwind says, then you could in theory at least edit the source list at same time as you use it to find and install new software. This could lead to that a program that you've installed edits the source list and adds an unsafe repository at the same time as you are upgrading your system. This could be a security issue. \nAnother example \nAlso if you edit the source list at 2 separate commands then when you save you would replace the newest version, which will be the one that it's save last. Which means that command in the middle wouldn't have any effect, since you would save over an old version. \n\nWindows behaves similarly using the \"official\" (MSI) installer\n\nEven in Windows,multiple softwares can be installed simultaneously ... \n  is there an advantage in this or why this is a necessity in linux/ubuntu,etc...\n\nPackages that use the official Windows installer (MSI) WILL REFUSE to run more than one instance at a time. That's because the MSI installer database is similar to sources.list, dpkg info files, etc. -- you don't want more than one installer modifying/locking them at a time.\nBut a lot of Windows packages use third-party installers like Installshield, NSIS, etc. which will run alongside each other because they do not need to access/modify the MSI database. Similarly, in Linux/Ubuntu, no one's stopping you from running an apt-get, a tar -xzf and a perl/bash install script all at the same time :)\n\nA: simple way  to installing several file in one time, follow these steps\n\n\n*\n\n*copy all the installation folder, for example : /home/user/apps\n\n*Open terminal and Type : \n\nCD /home/user/apps\n\n\n*and then type again\n\nsudo dpkg -i *.deb\n\nwait untill the installation finish.\n\nA: you get download the package whilst the other is installing e.g in terminal1\nsudo apt-get install vlc\n\nthen also download another package in another terminal2\nsudo apt-get download openssh-server\n\nto see other options available with apt-get refer to its man simple type\napt-get <press tab on your keyboard>\n\n", "Q: Cannot find any wireless networks - Networking service failing My netbook is running Ubuntu 10.04.03 LTS (lucid) and everything was working perfectly till yesterday.

I have an Hp pavilion dv2000 and it has a pretty nice blue buttons over the keyboard, some are for multimedia (which work perfectly), and other two are for launch a DVD application and a multimedia center on Windows, however, those doesn't work for anything on Ubuntu, because they are not even recognized as keyboard buttons.\nSo how can I activate them?\n\nA: If you are running an old version of Ubuntu (9.xx?) then you should try upgrading.\nIf you are on Ubuntu 10.04 and up, go the System>Preferences>Keyboard Shortcuts, and add new short cuts for your multimedia keys (they will almost definitely be detected). In fact, they may already exist, but not be assigned to launch any applications.\nAs for the volume/play/pause/stop buttons (I believe you have those, if it is a dv2000) you should be able to use those out of the box in most recent versions of Ubuntu (even most older versions). If you are not able to use those buttons in particular, then you should report a bug (but only if you are using a supported version of Ubuntu; which means 10.04 and up).\n\nIf you are not sure they are being detected, run xev in a terminal and press the keys. You will see their key codes on the terminal if they are working.

I had used the installer's formatting tool, with 15G as / 2.5 G swap, and the rest for /home. But after the reboot (the installer USB media still plugged in), the third partition was not recognized/mounted automatically. Even worse: I had tried to mount manually via mount -t ext4 /dev/sda /home but I was out of luck as it complained about bad fs type, superblock.... So I did a mkfs.ext4 /dev/sda3, but still can't mount. Even worse: after unplugging the USB installer and rebooting I was greeted with GRUB error 17.\n\n*OK read a lot, reinstall, this time format with GParted (from the Ubuntu menu) using GPT partition table, this time: 2.5 G swap, the rest is /, then run the installer, and used the previously created partitions. After rebooting with the USB installer still plugged in everything seemed normal. After unplugging the USB and rebooting, I was greeted with GRUB unknown fs, with grub rescue> where I wasn't able to boot :-(\n\n*(and 4....6) read and research a lot, tried Archlinux (shame on me, I love that distro too), same story either with partitioning via gfdisk, using GPT table, then tried fdisk -H 32 -S 32 /dev/sda as described here: https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Solid_State_Drives and double checked the results as recommended: https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/SSD_Memory_Cell_Clearing#Post_Process_Observation But the results are the same: I can boot with my USB plugged in (and if there are more then one partition the last is not recognized). After unplugging the USB key, I can't boot. I had also tried the recommendation to create the 1 Mb BIOS boot partition on the GPT partition (same archlinux SSD wiki page), still no luck.

I know that if I drag the content from all of them over another one I can merge them. But with so many folders it will take me hours.\nSo, I need a way of merging all the folders inside a directory, with a bash script, or a program that does that.\nEDIT\nAs a plus, I would like it if the folder structure was preserved and inside all the folders there will be folders with the same names. These folders need to be merged.\n\nA: I would suggest doing a search in the parent folder for . and include all subfolders. This will let you select all the files and then move them into another folder. This will merge all the contents into the new folder. \n\nA: If this is your folder structure ...\nfol1\n| `-subfolA\n| | `-one.txt\n| `-subfolB\n|   `-two.txt\nfol2\n `-subfolA\n  | `-een.txt\n  `-subfolB\n    `-twee.txt\n\n... and you want ...\nfol1\n| `-subfolA\n| | `-een.txt\n| | `-one.txt\n| `-subfolB\n|   `-twee.txt\n|   `-two.txt\nfol2\n\n... then you can:\n\n\n*\n\n*Go into fol1;\n\n*hit Ctrl-A to select all subfolders;\n\n*drag them into folB. Nautilus will see that there already exists a subfolA etc, and will ask whether you want to merge [this one/all of them] automatically.\n\n\nOr you could open the terminal and\ncd path/to/fol1\ncp -r ../fol2/* ./\n\nThat automerges, too. Elaboratish explanation, just in case a bash novice encounters this answer:\n\n\n*\n\n*cd changes directory. \n\n*cp copies; the first folder is the source, the second the destination. \n\n*-r means to descend into subfolders ('recurse'). \n\n*../fol2/* means one directory up / into fol2 / all files and folders you can find there.\n\n*./ is the current directory.\n\n\nA: The following python script should do what you want. Just copy the contents in a file (named sc1.py, say) in the folder which contains all the subfolders you want to merge. Then run the command chmod +x sc1.py and then run this file in that folder ./sc1.py and you should get the result. What this script will do is the following:\nSay you are working in the folder /home/bob/foo and you have hundreds of folders bar1, bar2,....,bar99 inside the folder foo.\nRun the script in /home/bob/foo/ and it will create a folder /home/bob/foo/Merged and it will transfer the contents of all the folders bar1,bar2 etc... inside the folder Merged. The directory stuctures inside the folders bar1,bar2 etc will remain intact\nYou may want to test this somewhere to see that this is what you asked for.\n#!/usr/bin/env python\n\nimport subprocess as sbp\nimport os\n\npath=os.getcwd()\nfol = os.listdir(path)\np2 = os.path.join(path,'Merged')\n\nsbp.Popen(['mkdir','Merged'])\n\nfor i in fol:\n    if os.path.isdir(i)==True:\n        if i!='Merged':\n            p1 = os.path.join(path,i)\n            p3 = 'cp -r \"' + p1 +'\"/* ' + p2\n            sbp.Popen(p3,shell=True)\n\nNote: I am an absolute beginner at scripting and just learned most of these commands.

When i boot with modesetting off, it boots without problems. However, I'm not really interested in using natty in fallback mode, and would like to try out the 3d accelerated version.

I know how to switch the audio out device using the speaker menu item, but how does one do this from the command line? I'd like to write some shell scripts around this functionality.\n\nA: Have a look at the wiki page for command line Pulseaudio and these 2 commands:\n\npacmd - Reconfigure a PulseAudio sound server during runtime.\npactl - Control a running PulseAudio sound server.\n\nSome (old) examples I found on the web...\nChange to jack out:\npacmd \"set-default-sink jack_out\" \n\nEnable headset:\npactl load-module module-alsa-sink device=Headset; sleep 2\npactl load-module module-alsa-source device=Headset; sleep 2\npacmd \"set-default-sink alsa_output.Headset\"\npacmd \"set-default-source alsa_input.Headset\"\n\nBoth untested: no usb headset and no jack out to test\n\nA: This works as a script for me in Ubuntu 11.10:\npacmd \"set-default-sink alsa_output.usb-Plantronics_Wireless_Audio_Plantronics_Wireless_Audio-00-Audio.analog-stereo\"\npacmd \"set-default-source alsa_input.usb-Plantronics_Wireless_Audio_Plantronics_Wireless_Audio-00-Audio.analog-mono\"\nIt sets both the output and input to my wireless headset (assuming that I've plugged in the usb dongle for the headset).\nThe way I learned the name of the output device (sink) and input device (source) was to use these 2 commands:\npacmd \"list-sinks\"\npacmd \"list-sources\"\nWhen you do this, you'll get a ton of info on each sink or source. You want the name, and don't copy the < or > at the beginning and end of the name.\nI would really like this script to run automatically whenever I plug in the headset usb dongle. Does anyone know how to do that? \nIt's kind-of like when you insert media and Ubuntu asks what you want to do with it, but this isn't media: the usb headset dongle is essentially a sound card for the purposes of this script.\nHow can I assign what happens when a usb sound card is inserted?\n", "Q: How to batch convert an image to a PDF? I want to batch convert images (jpg, png, etc.) to PDF. Converting them directly to PDF is easy with:\nconvert in.jpg out.pdf\n\nHowever I need some more options, such as setting the output page size, margins and rotation between landscape and portrait format. After some trial and error I have come up with:\nconvert -rotate \"90>\" -page A4+0+0  -gravity center in.jpg  out.pdf\n\nThis centers the image on an A4 page and automatically rotates between landscape and portrait, however it only works with small images below 595x842. Larger images break, as 595x842 seems to be the resolution in pixel that is assigned to an A4 page. Reading around on the net, -density option might be a potential solution to increase the pixel count on an A4 page, but I couldn't make it work.\nSolutions outside of Imagemagick are of course welcome as well.\n\nA: One workaround is to split the image generation and the PDF conversion. First convert the images via convert to A4@300dpi (i.e. 3508x2479), then use sam2p to convert them to PDF and then use sam2p_pdf_scale to convert them to A4.\nconvert -rotate \"90>\" -scale 3508x2479 -border 64x64 -bordercolor white in.png out.png\nsam2p out.png out.pdf\nsam2p_pdf_scale 595 842 out.pdf\n\nEdit: A more complete script:\n#!/bin/sh\n\nA4_WIDTH=2479\nA4_HEIGHT=3508\n\nH_MARGIN=64\nV_MARGIN=64\nWIDTH=$((${A4_WIDTH} - ${H_MARGIN} * 2))\nHEIGHT=$((${A4_HEIGHT} - ${V_MARGIN} * 2))\n\nfor i in \"$@\"; do\n    TMP=\"/tmp/$(uuidgen).png\"\n    echo \"$i\"\n    convert \\\n        -rotate \"90>\" \\\n        -scale \"${WIDTH}x${HEIGHT}\" \\\n        -border \"${H_MARGIN}x${V_MARGIN}\" -bordercolor white \\\n        -gravity center \\\n        -extent \"${A4_WIDTH}x${A4_HEIGHT}\" \\\n        -gravity center \\\n        -font helvetica -pointsize 80 \\\n        -fill white -draw \\\n        \"push graphic-context\n         translate $((${A4_WIDTH}/2 - 160)), 0\n         rotate 90\n         text -2,-2 '$i'\n         text -2,2 '$i'\n         text 2,-2 '$i'\n         text 2,2 '$i'\n         pop graphic-context\n    \" \\\n        -fill black -draw \\\n        \"push graphic-context\n         translate $((${A4_WIDTH}/2 - 160)), 0\n         rotate 90\n         text 0,0 '$i'\n         pop graphic-context\n    \" \\\n        \"$i\" \"$TMP\"\n    sam2p \"$TMP\" \"${i}.pdf\"\n    sam2p_pdf_scale 595 842 \"${i}.pdf\"\ndone\n\n# EOF #\n\n\nA: A bit cleaner than the other answer:\nls *.jpg | sed -r 's/(.*)\\.(\\w{3,4})/\\1.\\2 \\1.pdf/' | xargs -n2 sam2p 2>&1 | grep OutputFile | perl -pe 's/.*: //' | xargs pdfjoin --outfile out.pdf\n\nSee it in action at http://convertjpgpdf.net.\n", "Q: XML reader for my big files I'm looking for big XML reader, I tried XML Copy Editor, but it can't handle the big xml files (20-50MB) I have. I don't want to edit the XML, only browsing that.\n\nA: XML Copy editor (like most of the similar programs) try to read in the XML in 1 go. Depending on the formatting of the XML this might take some time. What you are looking for is byte-stream editor (these load only part of the file before showing you it).\n\n\n*\n\n*If it is just browsing a file the command line less might be interesting.\n\n\n\nLess is a program similar to more, but which allows backward  movement in the file as well as forward movement. Also, less does not have to read the entire input file before  starting,  so  with  large  input files  it  starts  up  faster than text editors. \n\n\n\n*\n\n*And there is also good old reliable sed\n\nSed is a stream editor. A stream editor is used to perform basic text transformations on an input stream (a file or input from  a  pipeline). While  in  some  ways similar to an editor which permits scripted edits (such as ed), sed works by making only one pass over the input(s),  and is consequently more efficient.  But it is sed's ability to filter text in a pipeline which particularly distinguishes it from other  types  of editors.\n\n", "Q: How to install a limited bootloader When I installed Ubuntu on my USB flash drive (a proper permanent install, not a live cd with casper), the installer recognized the operating system on the host computer, a laptop, and made an entry in grub for it. Now, I want to use this USB thumb drive on any computer I go to, so the Vista entry will be useless on some other PC. I mentioned laptop because I tried to disconnect the HDD (on which Vista is installed) in the BIOS setup, but apparently laptop BIOS's don't always have this option.\nSo, what bootloader can I install that will only boot from the boot partition of my USB thumb drive?\n\nA: If I understand you correctly, you currently have the following setup:\nBIOS -> GRUB2 -> Boot USB\n\nHowever, when you installed Ubuntu to the USB drive, you should make sure that you install grub to the USB drive, not the host hard drive, e.g. /dev/sdb not /dev/sda. So your setup should be like this:\nBIOS -> Boot USB -> GRUB2\n\nPlease note that if you but your USB drive from a different machine other than the one you installed it on, it is not guaranteed to work properly. There may be settings specific to your machine.\n", "Q: Working with printers in Ubuntu with the Unity desktop How to I find my printer and stop print jobs that were not completed in Ubuntu with the Unity desktop?\n\nA: In 11.04, you can open system settings from the power-button in the upper-right corner. You'll find printers under Hardware and it'll display a list of printers. Double click it to show the queue. \nIn 11.10, we have a Printers item in the power-menu as a shortcut. The dialog itself has not changed.\n\nA: Search Unity for \"Printing\". You will find a list of your printers. If you double-click to open a selected printer, you can manage the print jobs including canceling jobs.\n\nA: If you turn on \"all\" or the appropriate value in the whitelist (for the system tray), you can see the print queue as normal.\n", "Q: How do I submit feedback on the ubuntu font? I've joined the Ubuntu Font Family Interest Group and I'd like to provide feedback on the mono beta font, or, at least see if other people have reported the same issue I'm seeing.\nWhat's the best way to engage with the ubuntu font folks?\n\nA: If you are reporting a bug or problem with the font, you should file it in Launchpad. Otherwise, you could ask a question on this page.\n\nA: Ubuntu Font Family had its own wiki page and there you can find that the project is hosted on launchpad for tracking bugs and wishes and there is also the Ubuntu typeface interest page on launchpad.\n", "Q: How do I check the SHA1 hash of a file? How do I check the SHA1 hash of a file?\n\nA: Without creating local file:\n$ sha1sum filename\n\n8dd10000eb1b768800000e1d2fe1c3100005d2dc *filename\n\nFor checking, go to the directory that contains filename and run this command:\necho \"8dd10000eb1b768800000e1d2fe1c3100005d2dc *filename\" | sha1sum -c -\n\n\nA: What are you people talking about?  Yes, I get the concept behind sha1sum, but the info above is confusing to say the best.  First, Ubuntu does not seem to have sha1sum files - just strings on a web page such as this for Mate 16.04 Beta 1:\nbfba577970d573e0ba5095fbb72787de97f88b4b *ubuntu-mate-16.04-beta1-desktop-amd64.iso\nefcbbc70b10173cea203df30396d0848ba8fa0d8 *ubuntu-mate-16.04-beta1-desktop-i386.iso\n8563fec4d66bce851b0800f5ac746f38e4041a6a *ubuntu-mate-16.04-beta1-desktop-powerpc.iso\n\nTo check the integrity of a downloaded .iso, one opens the terminal program, does \"cd Downloads\", then sha1sum <ubuntu-mate-16.04-beta1-desktop-i386.iso>.  After a bit, the terminal will produce a hash such as\nefcbbc70b10173cea203df30396d0848ba8fa0d8  ubuntu-mate-16.04-beta1-desktop-i386.iso\n\nNext, we have to go to the web page and compare the strings to verify that the verification works.  Not nearly as easy as it could be.\n\nA: sha1sum\n\nPrint or check SHA1 (160-bit) checksums.  With no FILE, or when FILE is -, read standard input.\n\nsha1sum {file}\n\nIf you want to send the file together with its sha1sum output redirect the output to a file:\nsha1sum {file} > {file}.sha1\n\nSend both files and the other party can do a...\nsha1sum -c {file}.sha1\n\nIt should show OK if the sha1 is correct.\n\nA: Its very simple.\nNavigate to the terminal and key in:\nsha1sum  filename\n\nto check a sha1 hash use:\nsha1sum -c filename.sha1\n\nThe check argument generates the sha1 hash of filename and compares it with the value stored in filename.sha1. If it matches OK is displayed and the exit code for the command is 0\n\nA: Python\nPython  has excellent hashlib library, that allows calculating multiple hashsums, including sha1.

That caused\n  the original problem.

It also failed with the same issue.\nI repeated this process with unetbootin as well for both versions.\nFinally, I downloaded the Ubuntu 10.04 ISO and used the recommended\n  USB creator once again. There was an error while creating the USB live\n  install so I reformatted the USB key as FAT32 and tried again. It\n  created the USB key.\nI then booted from the USB flash drive and selected \"Install Ubuntu\"\n  (exact wording was different). It worked! It took me through the\n  process that you see shown in pictures on the Ubuntu website. I let it\n  create the appropriate partitions for me and it simply worked.\nI did get a few errors while the system tried to restart after it\n  installed. It hung on a terminal-like screen but I pressed ENTER and\n  it restarted. I booted into Windows 7, it checked the disks as it\n  sensed that I messed with a partition, then it booted into Windows\n  normally.\nNow I'm going to uninstall Wubi and update my new full install of\n  Ubuntu! I'm excited to get the benefits of a full install now. So in\n  the end, hopefully someone can learn from what I did.\n\n\nA: I've recently had installation problems during a 12.04 installation process (I also had the screen just going blank with no further response) on an older machine.

Ok, I think I already know the answer to this one, but it's important I try a bit more.\nI have been using a wubi installation of xubuntu for about a month, keeping my windows installation for some data I needed.\nIt's been working fine until this morning when I got to the usual boot menu, but trying to boot into xubuntu simply sent me to the grub screen. Imagining it was something broken in the mbr or similar I booted into a sysrescue cd that I knew would come in handy and booted into an xfce session. I mounted my windows partition and found that the disk I was expecting to find at /mnt/windows/ubuntu/... was gone. There was simply nothing there.\nIt's not a pain to re-install ubuntu, and I am now intending to ditch windows permanently (or possibly keep it on a small partition for testing), but I had about 2 days work of solid project on the drive, which I hadn't backed up because I was working on it as a test, and hadn't realised how much there was until it was gone. Is there any way I can get this back? If I knew roughly what data would be on the disk then I could find it and undelete it?

Whenever I adjust the volume there's a popping sound to indicate when the volume is changing. I find it really annoying. \nIs there any way to change/disable this behaviour? \n\nA: You would have to turn the Notification sounds to off, or delete the specific sound that is played (but this would affect other event sounds and is not advised).\nScreenshot:\n\n\nA: The dconf-editor settings did not help on my system, so I actually replaced the \"pop\" audio sound file with a silent one, and then rebooted:\n# mv /usr/share/sounds/freedesktop/stereo/audio-volume-change.oga /usr/share/sounds/freedesktop/stereo/audio-volume-change.oga.backup\n# cp silent.ogg /usr/share/sounds/freedesktop/stereo/audio-volume-change.oga\n# reboot now\n\nYou can create a silent Ogg Vorbis file in Audacity pretty easily.\n\nA: It's not really documented anywhere, but holding ALT while pressing whichever key is responsible for volume up/down/mute will change the volume setting without the pops.\nThese are all controlled by gnome-settings-daemon, and unfortunately while VOLUME_UP_KEY and VOLUME_DOWN_KEY are assignable, VOLUME_DOWN_QUIET_KEY and VOLUME_UP_QUIET_KEY are hardcoded to ALT+XF86AudioLowerVolume and ALT+XF86AudioRaiseVolume respectively, with no easy way to change them.\nI've opened a question regarding the feasibility of making the QUIET keys assignable in a future release.\nTL;DR: You can hold ALT while changing the volume to mute the pops, but you can't currently assign this action to the default keys\n\nA: The only way I know to do that is using your mouse. You can go to the sound indicator in the upper right corner, click on it and adjust the volume in the slide bar or click on 'mute'. \n\nA: The following command appears to work:\ngsettings set org.gnome.desktop.sound event-sounds false\n\n\nA: Go to your Sound Settings (the Volume Icon in the top right corner and click on it, and then click on the Sound Settings option at the bottom of the list.)\nFrom there click on the Sound Effects tab. There will be a sliding bar labeled Alert Volume. Either slide it all the way to the left or just check the Mute box beside the bar. That should do it.\n\nA: I've found a solution which is actually more like a workaround: \nIn the \"Keyboard\" system settings, you have to change the keybindings of volume up, down and mute and add the \"Alt\" key to the existing, i.e. \"Alt+Volume up\" and so on.\nCheers,\nDominik\nI got the hint from the source file \"shortcuts-list.h\".\n\nA: Go to Terminal (CTRL+ALT+T) and type in the following commands:\ngsettings set org.gnome.desktop.sound event-sounds false\npulseaudio -k\n\n\nA: Another way is to just keep the cursor on top of the volume icon and scroll to change volume.\n\nA: Using Gnome-shell DE with extension volume mixer has solved problem for me. But I had to enable boost volume option in extension config\n\nA: Still found no satisfying solution here, except killing the file with:\ncd /usr/share/sounds/freedesktop/stereo/\nsudo mv audio-volume-change.oga audio-volume-change.oga-DISCARDED-TOO-ANNOYING\n\nthen loging back and in again u_u\n\nA: I had issues with the ALT solution, so for Ubuntu 19 I used (note: Yaru, not freedesktop):\nmv /usr/share/sounds/Yaru/stereo/audio-volume-change.oga /usr/share/sounds/Yaru/stereo/audio-volume-change.oga.backup\n\nThen just reboot.\n\nA: I have Ubuntu 19.10 (and a Logitech K400+ wireless keyboard with Solaar-gnome3 installed).\nEditing the following \"-static\" keys in dconf-editor under the path\norg.gnome.settings-daemon.plugins.media-keys worked for me to mute the popping sound of the volume setting media keys:\n\n", "Q: How do I save error message from console?

Canonical themselves will not support this integration.  Thus unless someone steps forward, this capability will not be included in natty or future versions of Ubuntu.\n\nA: You can use a modified version of Chromify-OSD, a Javascript that lets Firefox use notify-osd for notifications. \n\n\n*\n\n*Download Greasemonkey extension for Firefox.\n\n*Download the Chromify-OSD script\n\n*Download the NPAPI plugin and copy them to your ~/.mozilla/plugins/ folder and restart the browser. \n\n*After all that, run the following command in a terminal: \nsudo ln -s /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libnotify.so.4 /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libnotify.so.1\n\nNow, Firefox should be using notify-OSD for notifications.\nRelated question:\n\n\n*\n\n*How to make Firefox use chromify-osd?\n\nA: Use GNotifier but use it at your own risk, as its' not approved by Mozilla for some reason.\n\nA: You can install xul-ext-notify as mentioned by fossfreedom, but it is not supported and you might have to install the addon compatibility reporter to get it to work in later versions of Firefox.\n", "Q: how do I bring a vm created with testdrive under kvm or qemu?

So that the first connection to testuser@remotelaptop is shared when you ssh into it the second time and the first is still running? \n(I use ssh keys.

Ubuntu is on a 2nd machine, and my primary machine is a 3-monitor Windows 7 setup.\nI can VNC into Ubuntu, however I would like to disable screen updates or at least limit the update rate. Too much CPU is being used on Ubuntu when all I really need is VNC for input, not for display (I connect the Ubuntu machine directly into the 2nd input of my primary monitor; this is a fake KVM in a way). \nHow can I alter the Ubuntu Remote Desktop settings so that less or no CPU is spent compressing and transmitting display updates? or if this is not possible, what other VNC server software can I install instead? I know this is possible in theory because I already do this in an OS X specific VNC server I found which permits disabling display updates. \n(Configured correctly with OS X right now, I can move between left/middle/right displays without any lag, where in fact left=Win7, middle=blank VNC \"surface\" into OS X, right=Win7. I am trying to do the same with Ubuntu now.)\n\nA: I'm not sure if I understand your question correctly, but Synergy might be what you want. It supports Windows, Linux and MacOSX.

Both OS's working fine.\nMy concern is that when I am in Ubuntu the fan seems to be running all the time, making the system noisier. Is there any solution to this? Windows 7 is much quieter. I know that this contradicts the common perception.\n\nA: There are different possible causes: Either your system is effectively using more power (more cpu activity) and it needs more cooling. A second option is that you miss a driver which disables the fan if it is not needed.\nIn the first case you will also drain your battery much faster so it is certainly worth looking at these tips:\n1) some driver is not installed, often the graphics driver. In this case your cpu will take over. Since it is less efficient, than the graphics card it will use more power.  You can check for binary drivers here:\n\nIn Ubuntu 10.04 and 9:10 this is found under System->Administration->Hardware Drivers.\nNote:In Ubuntu 10:10 Hardware Drivers is now named Additional Drivers\n  (from https://help.ubuntu.com/community/BinaryDriverHowto) \n\n2) There are program which wake your system up all the time disabling your cpu to go into power save mode. The best thing you can do is to try installing powertop.\nsudo aptitude install powertop\n\nIf you run it as root it will give you different tips to save power. Try enabling them and see if your system runs cooler.\nsudo powertop\n\nSome more related tips are here: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/PowerManagement/ReducedPower\n3) Some programs cause a high cpu usage. Especially with flash I've noticed this. Does your fan still work loud if you have no programs running? Also try disabling/uninstalling programs which you don't need and which start automatically at boot. One notable program is tracker which indexes your harddrive to make search faster. However if you don't use it, you should remove it (note that it is no longer installed by default, so it may not be a problem for you).\n\nA: you can also use jupiter\nIt will help saving power, when you run your pc in battery.\n\nA: It seems that you've installed motherboard drivers in Windows but not in Ubuntu.

There might be no practical way to do this but to list all the packages except for the one: sudo apt-get install k3b-data k3b-dbg.\nHowever you can do that with some aid:\nsudo apt-get install $(apt-cache --no-generate pkgnames k3b \\\n    | grep -v extrathemes | tr '\\n' ' ')\n\nThat's not terribly partical. apt-cache ... returns the name of the  packages, grep -v PACKAGENAME excludes the packages and the tr command replaces new lines by spaces.\n\nA: I discovered a much simpler way of doing this:\nsudo aptitude install <package>\n\nThis will use aptitude instead of apt-get - which provides you with more options. When you see something like the following:\nThe following NEW packages will be installed:\n  ...\n0 packages upgraded, 12 newly installed, 0 to remove and 0 not upgraded.\nNeed to get 130 MB/130 MB of archives. After unpacking 216 MB will be used.\nDo you want to continue? [Y/n/?]\n\nInstead of pressing 'y', type the following:\n-<package_to_skip>\n\nThat's a '-' followed by the name of the package to skip. Then you can proceed with the installation as per normal.\n\nA: You can trivially do this with apt; if you want to install foo but not bar, do this:\nsudo apt install foo bar-\n\ni.e. append a hyphen to bar. From the apt-get man page:\n\nIf a hyphen is appended to the package name (with no\n  intervening space), the identified package will be removed if it is\n  installed. Similarly a plus sign can be used to designate a package\n  to install.\n\nThis apparently works for packages that would be installed, as well as those that are already installed.\n", "Q: How to install libnss3-dev?

I've read the Upstart features and it says nothing about concurrency.\nI also read old advices to set CONCURRENCY value in the /etc/init.d/rc\nBut there is a comment:\n\nSpecify method used to enable concurrent init.d scripts.\n  Valid options are 'none', 'startpar' and 'makefile'. To enable\n  the concurrent boot option, the init.d script order must allow for\n  concurrency.  This is not the case with the default boot sequence in\n  Debian as of 2008-01-20.  Before enabling concurrency, one need to\n  check the sequence values of all boot scripts, and make sure only\n  scripts that can be started in parallel have the same sequence\n  number, and that a scripts dependencies have a earlier sequence\n  number. See the insserv package for a away to reorder the boot\n  automatically to allow this. \n\nAnd the CONCURRENCY is set to none.\ninsserv is installed in my Ubuntu 11.04. But is it used?\nMy system is already amazingly fast because it's on the SSD. But I'd like to know if it uses all cores during boot.\n\nA: Increasingly this setting is becoming meaningless as most services are launched by Upstart.  Only the scripts listed in /etc/init.d/ that are not symlinks are run as System V style init scripts.\nChkconfig is not very useful on newer versions of Ubuntu (10.04 on) because so many of the jobs are now run by Upstart.  Any error like the one you posted means bascially \"this is an Upstart job, I can't do anything with it\".  The symlinks in /etc/init.d are for your convenience and for compatibility with scripts that expect to start services with a command like /etc/init.d/acpid start.  \nThe real startup script/job is /etc/init/acpid.conf.  Only the scripts in /etc/init.d that aren't links to /etc/init can be manipulated with commands like chkconfig or update-rc.d.\nI don't expect there to be much speed difference at all with any setting you put in there. Upstart is already highly parallelized and it's doing by far most of the work booting your system.  To answer the headline question:  YES, the Ubuntu boot process is definitely taking advantage of multiple cores.\n", "Q: How do I set my screen resolution to the maximum supported resolution?

Actually while typing this...just thinking, would bashrc be a better way than a script?\n\nA: You can use a custom SSH configuration file for making aliases for hosts. Create the ~/.ssh/config file if it does not already exist and add the following:\nHost school\n    User yourverylonguserid\n    HostName your.very.long.school.example.com\n    # Optionally, change the port:\n    #Port 22\n\nThen, use ssh school to login, you can even omit the user part since it was set in the configuration file. This works for other SSH tools as well, like scp and sshfs.\nYou're always able to override the settings in the configuration file. If you need to login with another user once (e.g. for testing purposes), you can specify the user to override the user:\nssh testuser@school\n\nFor more information, check the manual page of ssh_config(5)\n\nA: You could also setup a password-less SSH login with this question here. And then alias a command and put it in the .bash_aliases file.

Note that command is the alias you created.\n\n*Click Ok\n\n\nDouble-clicking the launcher will launch a terminal and connect via SSH to your school.\n\n\nA: You could make a file with the following contents:\n[Desktop Entry]\nName=School Server\nComment=Login to school server using ssh\nExec=ssh verylongname0434@linux.myschoolslongurl.net\nTerminal=true\nType=Application\nCategories=Development;\nStartupNotify=true\n\ncall it school-ssh.desktop, and set its 'executable' permission to true.

The \"power cog\" (the button at the top right corner of the screen) seems to have disappeared. I am not sure what caused that because it was there when I installed 11.10 beta 1. So I do not quite remember. The main thing is that I suspect the problem is either gnome-session or cairo dock. Can you help me to get that button back? And when on 22nd this month beta 2 gets out and I use apt-get dist-upgrade, will it install that button once again? Thanks for your help. If you cannot help me, just tell me how to logout (not shutdown) using cairo.\n\nA: It is called a beta for something. This has happened to me as well several times (11.10 beta 1).\nYou could search on Launchpad if this bug has already been reported (it'd surprise me if it hasn't been reported yet), and if it hasn't been reported yet, you could report it yourself.

Because archive.ubuntu.com hasn't any IPv6 endpoints, an IPv6-only Ubuntu machine is quite unusable: no package management, no updates, etc. \nIs there any way to overcome this problem without enabling IPv4?\n\nA: The main archive server, and many mirrors don't support IPv6 so going IPv6 only is very cutting edge of you but... most of the rest of humanity probably will join you when we are well into 2012 (if not 2015) or when it becomes really unavoidable.\nThat being said...\n\n\n*\n\n*I found a link from 2008 that states you can use a gateway from sixxs.net \nFrom the link:\n\nEdit your sources.list and replace http://archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/ by http://archive.ubuntu.com.ipv6.sixxs.org/ubuntu/\n\nLooking at the website this looks like it is still working.\n\n*Some mirrors are IPv6-ready (the ones operated by BIT).

It is called people nearby and is a special kind of account which does not require a server. Other than that, it's the same protocol as Facebook and Google uses. Everyone who has activated that will be visible to everyone else on the same network that has also activated it.\n\nA: You can do this with finch , the command-line equivalent to pidgin, by setting up local accounts (Bonjour/Avahi). I have not used finch myself, so I cannot guide you in the setup, but it should be fairly easy.\n\nA: You can use iptux. It is a very convenient GUI-based program.

Unity and Unity 2D look very much alike, so how can new users easily find out whether they are running Unity or Unity 2D?\n\nA: Note:\nAs of Ubuntu 12.10, Unity 2D is no longer developed and all systems use Unity 3D (with LLVMpipe for systems without hardware acceleration).\n\nThe easiest way I have found is to look at the launcher:\nSubtlety in the design of the of the launcher popups - Unity 3D lives up to its name with a darker shadow \"3D\" effect whereas Unity 2D is lighter and has a \"2D\" flat effect. \nUnity 3D\n Unity 2D \nIf you don't trust your eyes you can rely on the system to tell you, just look at the desktop session variable, open a terminal and type:\necho $DESKTOP_SESSION\n\nIf it echoes back ubuntu-2d that means you are using Unity 2D and ubuntu for Unity3D.\nBut if you want a bit more details (and that's a big if), here is an extended review:\nUnity 3D\nUnity 3D has several features that set it apart, that are the result of it's \"3D\" nature and the capabilities afforded to it that way:\n\n\n*\n\n*The launcher items fold when there are too many windows open or excess items pinned to the launcher.\n\n*Also, the trash can icon in Unity 3D is based on your current icon theme, and thus looks transparent in the default setup (when empty).\n\n*The Panel and Dash change colour to match your wallpaper when the Dash is open, and the launcher is mildly translucent by default.\n\n*The Dash icon is black on white, with a transparent border, and rounded edges.\n\n*Unity 3D is a Compiz plugin and requires Compiz, which means your graphics card must have 3D support, and you cannot run it on another window manager; so if you are running anything but Compiz with Unity - you are definitely not running Unity 3D.\n\n*Unity 3D's icons have a nice gloss+glow to them, and transparent/translucent edges.\n\n*Unity 3D takes advantage of compositing fully even for quicklists and Launcher item tooltips.\n\n*Unity 3D's panel has a shadow.\n\n*Unity 3D has a fully 3D workspace switcher with smooth animations and an orange glow.\n\n\n\n\nPLEASE NOTE:\nThese images present a slightly modified launcher, in that I have the Launcher set to \"Edge Illumination Toggles\" instead of the default \"Backlight Always On\".\n\n \n\n\n*\n\n*Unity 3D's Launcher with folded icons.\n \n\n\n*\n\n*Unity 3D's Trash Icon\n\nUnity 2D:\nThere are several differences in Unity 2D from Unity 3D. One of them is that the launcher items do not ever fold.\nAlso note the following:\n\nNotable differences in Unity 2D\n\n\n*\n\n*The Dash button is not translucent.\n\n*Other buttons are flat icons, and not transparent/translucent with a glossy appearance as in Unity 2D.\n\n\nAlso of note:\n\n\n*\n\n*The launcher and Dash are not transparent when not using a composting window manager such as Compiz  or Mutter  (for example). In the Default install, Metacity has compositing enabled.\n\n*Unity 2D can run in different Window Managers, unlike Unity 3D. If you run top or gnome-system-monitor, you will notice that Unity 2D also consists of separate processes for the Panel, Launcher, and Dash.\n\n*As noted by fossfreedom, Unity 2D does not currently take advantage of compositing for Launcher item tooltips and quicklists.\n\n*The Panel + Dash do not adapt to your wallpaper when the Dash is open.\n\n*The Panel has no shadow.\n\n*Unity 2D's workspace switcher has no glow, and has slow animations with no smoothness to them.\n\n*When there is an overflow of items on the Launcher, there is no folding. The launcher only scrolls.\n\n\nA: Just found out how to tell which session you are using, via command.\nWay to know which session is being used (lightdm only, so 11.10 or above):\ntail -n 20 /var/log/lightdm/lightdm.log | grep \"Starting session\" | cut -d ' ' -f5\n\nOtherwise:\necho $DESKTOP_SESSION\n\nHope that helps!\n\nA: In Unity 3d, the dash icon is shaped differently than all of the other items in the launcher. So if the dash icon is the same shape as all of the other launcher icons, you are using Unity 2d.

I have a laptop running 11.10 with 2 network interfaces, wired and wireless.  Wireless interface connects to the router with DHCP and connects to the internet. Wired interface is connected to a switch. I want the computers on the switch to get their IP addresses from the router not my laptop.  \n\n\n*\n\n*How would I go about setting this up? Bridging the interfaces?\n\n\nA: Since Ubuntu 15.04 you can use the NetworkManager GUI for that:\n\nHow to configure a Linux bridge with Network Manager on Ubuntu\nThe easiest way to create a bridge with Network Manager is via nm-connection-editor. This GUI tool allows you to configure a bridge in easy-to-follow steps.\nTo start, invoke nm-connection-editor.\n$ nm-connection-editor\n\nThe editor window will show you a list of currently configured network connections. Click on \"Add\" button in the top right to create a bridge.\n\nNext, choose \"Bridge\" as a connection type.\n\nNow it's time to configure a bridge, including its name and bridged connection(s). With no other bridges created, the default bridge interface will be named bridge0.\nRecall that the goal of creating a bridge is to share your Ethernet interface via the bridge. So you need to add the Ethernet interface to the bridge. This is achieved by adding a new \"bridged connection\" in the GUI. Click on \"Add\" button.\n\nChoose \"Ethernet\" as a connection type.\n\nIn \"Device MAC address\" field, choose the interface that you want to enslave into the bridge. In this example, assume that this interface is eth0.\n\nClick on \"General\" tab, and enable both checkboxes that say \"Automatically connect to this network when it is available\" and \"All users may connect to this network\".\n\nSave the change.\nNow you will see a new slave connection created in the bridge.\n\nClick on \"General\" tab of the bridge, and make sure that top-most two checkboxes are enabled.\n\nGo to \"IPv4 Settings\" tab, and configure either DHCP or static IP address for the bridge. Note that you should use the same IPv4 settings as the enslaved Ethernet interface eth0. In this example, we assume that eth0 is configured via DHCP. Thus choose \"Automatic (DHCP)\" here. If eth0 is assigned a static IP address, you should assign the same IP address to the bridge.\n\nFinally, save the bridge settings.\nNow you will see an additional bridge connection created in \"Network Connections\" window. You no longer need a previously-configured wired connection for the enslaved interface eth0. So go ahead and delete the original wired connection.\n\nAt this point, the bridge connection will automatically be activated. You will momentarily lose a connection, since the IP address assigned to eth0 is taken over by the bridge. Once an IP address is assigned to the bridge, you will be connected back to your Ethernet interface via the bridge. You can confirm that by checking \"Network\" settings.\n\nAlso, check the list of available interfaces. As mentioned, the bridge interface must have taken over whatever IP address was possessed by your Ethernet interface.\n\nThat's it, and now the bridge is ready to use!\n\n(Source)\n\nOther resources:\n\n\n*\n\n*Network Connection Bridge (Community Wiki)\n\n*Bridging Network Interfaces (Community Wiki)\n\nA: Yes, that is what you need to do. Sharing an internet connection using Network Manager will setup the sharer as a DHCP server, etc, which is not what you want. \nYou can read how to do it here: http://manpages.ubuntu.com/manpages/lucid/en/man5/bridge-utils-interfaces.5.html\n\nA: You can easily create a bridge using \"NetBridge\" a GUI network bridge creator. You can download in from:\nhttp://sourceforge.net/projects/bridger/\n", "Q: Keyboard incorrectly mapped when using Open NX I seem to be having keyboard issues on Ubuntu 11.04.

My mother uses separate desktops heavily and finds it very irritating when she accidentally double-clicks on a folder on her desktop rather than right-clicking and choosing \"open in new window\" as she's trained herself to usually do.\nIs there a way to set PCManFM to default to opening in new windows rather than new tabs?\n(She's using 12.04 (Precise Pangolin) at the moment)\nHere's a very rushed screencast explaining the behaviour I'm talking about.\n\nA: You can try to recompile PCManFM , I am running Lubuntu 12.04 with PCManFM 0.9.10 and these steps worked for me.\nFollow these steps:\n\n\n*\n\n*Open a Terminal and install the necessary packages:\nsudo apt-get install apt-src build-essential\n\n\n*Install the build dependencies:\nsudo apt-get build-dep pcmanfm\n\n\n*Create a folder to download the source code:\nmkdir ~/Downloads/src\ncd ~/Downloads/src\n\n\n*Download the source:\napt-src install -b pcmanfm\n\n\n*Edit the pcmanfm-0.9.10/src/pcmanfm.c file.\nleafpad pcmanfm-0.9.10/src/pcmanfm.c\n\n\n*In Leafpad, search for the line fm_main_win_open_in_last_active(fi->path); (should be somewhere around line 420 and change it to fm_main_win_add_win(NULL, fi->path);.\nSave the changes and close the file. See the screenshots if it isn't clear:\nBefore:\n\nAfter:\n\n\n*Go to the pcmanfm-0.9.10/ folder to build the deb packages:\ncd pcmanfm-0.9.10/\ndpkg-buildpackage -rfakeroot -uc -b\n\n\n*Now you can install the deb packages:\ncd ..\nsudo dpkg -i pcmanfm*deb\n\n\n*Finally you can logout and Login to see the changes.\n\nReference: This post by ogilvierothchild in ubuntu forums.\n\nA: Edit this file (as root):\n/usr/share/applications/pcmanfm.desktop\n\nLook near the end of it for a line that says:\nExec=pcmanfm %U\n\nAdd the -n option to the command like this:\nExec=pcmanfm -n %U\n\nSave the edited file, and thereafter, pcmanfm will always open in a new window unless you specifically tell it to open something in a new tab.\nThe feature to default to opening in a tab rather than a new window would be fine if it were workspace-aware. The difficulty that arises is that you may have pcmanfm open on some other desktop and you try to open a file and nothing (apparently) happens. If you hunt around on your other desktops, you'll find it, but it should default to opening in a new window if there is no open pcmanfm on the current desktop.\n\nA: I've Fedora 20 with LXDE. If I do a right-click and go to Desktop preferencies or if you type the following command:\npcmanfm --desktop-pref\n\nUnder the tab Advanced there is the option \"Open folders from desktop in new window\" that resolve this problem.\n\nA: I'm running Ubuntu LXDE, not Fedora.\nThat option for \"pcmanfm --desktop-pref\"  does not work for me.\nI got a couple of errors, including a pop-up that says \"Desktop manager is not active.\"\nThe answer I provided previously (editing the pcmanfm.desktop file) does work for me.\n\nIn particular, I'm running a Ubuntu server install with LXDE added\nmanually after installation, rather than \"Lubuntu\", so it may be something\nparticular to my configuration that causes the error, or perhaps it's a\ndifference between Fedora and Ubuntu, I don't know.\nI'm just reporting what works for me.\n", "Q: When I boot up the computer normally, gdm won't work My laptop was working perfectly, but suddenly today I turned it on and after GRUB, the Plymouth splash flashed and then the screen went black with a blinking cursor. After blinking like 6 times, the cursor disappears and the screen stays completely black. Ubuntu won't boot after that and the computer is non-responsive to Ctrl+Alt+Del, so I have to reboot by holding the power button and then turning it back on.\nI tried using the Recovery Mode to see if it was a problem with X or whatever... But it always seemed to crash when it was going to ask me to login. I did some research on the Internet and then tried holding Shift while booting up and then pressing 'e' when GRUB showed up. I then removed \"quiet splash\" and tried with \"text\" there. Computer booted up and I didn't get any errors. Logged in with my user and password, and then did a manual startx. After that the laptop starts and runs perfectly, as I'm using it right now to write this message.\nI think the problem is something in gdm, but I don't know what. I thought maybe it was a problem with Plymouth, but I imagine failsafex from Recovery Mode would skip Plymouth and just send you to log in.\nDoes anybody have any idea how to get gdm to work again? Or any idea what could be wrong with it? \n\nA: If plymouth displays but gdm fails to start up at boot, the system may have left you on a blank VT (virtual terminal) and the end of the boot sequence.  You can try pressing Alt+F1 (or Alt+F2) to switch terminals and get to a text login.  (plymouth in Ubuntu boots on VT7, the same VT used for the X display; VTs 1-6 are reserved for text console logins.)\nYou can also try booting without any of the 'quiet', 'splash', or 'text' options.  If this allows gdm to start, then there is a bug in the interactions between plymouth and gdm affecting your system.  In that case, you should file a bug report against Ubuntu in launchpad:\nhttps://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/plymouth/+filebug\n\nA: I would reinstall gdm and libpcre3.\nIf that doesn't help, please post the full logs somewhere and provide the link to it here.\nSource:\nhttp://lists.alioth.debian.org/pipermail/pkg-gnome-maintainers/2011-February/075775.html\n", "Q: Problem after enabling Xinerama I enabled Xinerama and now I cant do anything.

How do I launch a script when the user opens a file?\n\nA: This is possible to do.\nYou will need to watch the file system using inotify-tools to check for events (such as files being opened) and then handle them as required (such as running a shell script).\nYou will need to know about incron too.\nThere are some examples on the incron site, something like this may be a starting point for you:\n\nExample: You need to run program abc with the full file path as an\n  argument every time a file is changed in /var/mail. One of the\n  solutions follows:\n/var/mail IN_CLOSE_WRITE abc $@/$#\n\n", "Q: How to decide on Swap size I wanted to just confirm how much the size of Swap partition should be. Lots of places tell that the swap size should be twice the size of RAM. Somebody also told me that it shouldn't be more than 8 GB.If twice the size of RAM is more than 8 GB how big should the Swap partition be?\n\nA: The only hard rule for swap space I know of is 1x RAM to Hibernate. The System Monitor or CLI free command will tell you how much swap space you're using with your particular hardware configuration and usage patterns. With 2GB of RAM my system rarely uses any swap space at all and never more than .4GB that I've seen.\n\nA: Swap isn't something you want to use. It's something you want to have as a last resort because swap isn't fast, it's dead-slow. And if you are using like 1 GB of swap then your system will be really slow to respond. \nThe whole point of SWAP memory is to not have a system crash when you run out of available RAM. It's not something you can use as extra memory or something you really want to use, unless you really really have to. \nSo for size, I would say 5 GB but if you are really doing heavy stuff that uses a lot of RAM then you could go up to 8 GB. But really if you start using more than 1 GB of swap, start killing process's. so you DON'T have a crash. \n\nA: The text below was obtained from the nixCraft page Linux: Should You Use Twice the Amount of Ram as Swap Space?. (Please follow the link and read the source for more information)\nNote that nixCraft page cites text purportedly coming from the OpenBSD FAQ, but there is no matching text in the current document; this may however be something that used to be in there in 2006 (so the 2 x RAM rule was already obsolete more than 10 years ago):\n\nNonsense rule: Twice the size of your main system RAM for Servers\nAccording to OpenBSD FAQ:\n\nMany people follow an old rule of thumb that your swap partition\n    should be twice the size of your main system RAM. This rule is\n    nonsense. On a modern system, that's a LOT of swap, most people\n    prefer\n    that their systems never swap. You don't want your system to ever\n    run\n    out of RAM+swap, but you usually would rather have enough RAM in the\n    system so it doesn't need to swap.\n\n\nMore from the nixCraft page:\n\nRed hat recommends setting as follows for RHEL 5:\n\nThe reality is the amount of swap space a system needs is not really\n    a\n    function of the amount of RAM it has but rather the memory workload\n    that is running on that system. A Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5 system\n    will run just fine with no swap space at all as long as the sum of\n    anonymous memory [memory mapping without file or device backing it:   memory obtained from the OS stack and heap] and system V shared memory is less than about 3/4 the\n    amount of RAM. In this case the system will simply lock the anonymous\n    and system V shared memory into RAM and use the remaining RAM for\n    caching file system data so when memory is exhausted the kernel only\n    reclaims pagecache memory.\nConsidering that:\n    1. At installation time when configuring the swap space there is no easy way to predetermine the memory a workload will require, and \n    2. The more RAM a system has the less swap space it typically needs, a better swap space [might be along this recommendation for CentOS Linux 7.x and RHEL 7]:\n\n\n\nAnd so the nixCraft page concludes:\n\nConclusion\nIf Linux kernel is going to use more than 2GiB swap space at a time,\n  all users will feel the heat. Either, you get more RAM (recommend) and\n  move to faster storage to improve disk I/O. There are no rules, each\n  setup and configuration is unique. Adjust values as per your\n  requirements. Select amount of swap that is right for you.\n\nFurthermore, this Red Hat article: Do we really need swap on modern systems? (2017) says:\n\nOur size recommendation for most modern systems is ‘a part of the\n  physical RAM’, for example, 20%. With this, the painfully slow phase\n  of operation in our example will not last as long, and the OOM kicks\n  in earlier.\nOf course, there are scenarios when different behaviour is desired.\n  When aware of the behaviour, such swap configurations are ok, as well\n  as running the system without any swap. Such a system is supported by\n  us as well - but the customer should know the behaviour in the above\n  situations.\n\n\nA: Normally you don't want (and shouldn't) use the swap that much, so yea, more than 8 gb seems like a lot. I have 8 gb of RAM on my desktop and a 8 gb swap, I don't think I ever used more than 1 gb of swap. The 2x rules makes sense for low amount of RAM but it gets a little crazy with ~6+ gb of RAM.\nOf course it depends on what you're doing with your computer...\n", "Q: Is it possible to hide unity's panel on a second monitor?

If I do this:\nalias g='git'\n\nI loose all completion rules (i.e. branches and remotes are no longer being automatically completed when I hit TAB after typing, for example g push o).\n\nA: In ~/.bashrc:\nalias g='git'\nsource /usr/share/bash-completion/completions/git\ncomplete -o default -o nospace -F _git g\n\nVia http://29a.ch/2013/8/9/fixing-bash-autocomplete-on-ubuntu-13-04\n\nA: First, look up the original completion command. Example:\n$ complete | grep git\n\ncomplete -o bashdefault -o default -o nospace -F __git_wrap__git_main git\n\nNow add these to your startup script (e.g. ~/.bashrc):\n# copy the original statement, but replace the last command (git) with your alias (g)\ncomplete -o bashdefault -o default -o nospace -F __git_wrap__git_main g\n\n# load dynamically loaded completion functions (may not be required)\n_completion_loader git\n\nThe _completion_loader line may not be required. But for some situations, the completion function is only loaded dynamically after you type the command and press TAB the first time. So if you haven't used the original command, and try the alias + TAB, you may get an error like \"bash: completion: function not found\".\n\nA: Latest bash-completion upstream moved and renamed things a bit.

I select a colour with the \"Select by color\" tool, change the fill colour to red ff0000, or 255,0,0, but when I click the selection to fill, it looks brown.\nOther colours also act this way: blue -> purple, yellow -> light brown, etc. White seems to fill correctly.\nSo, what am I doing wrong? I'm thinking it has to do with the file format or some underlying filter.\n\nA: It sounds like the image you are editing is using a limited colour palette rather than full 24-bit RGB.  GIMP is doing its best to do what you ask while using colours in the existing palette.\nIf you want to switch the image to full colour, select Image -> Mode -> RGB from the menus.  You should then be able edit the image using any colours you want.\nIf you need to save the image with an indexed colour palette, you can switch back again by picking the Indexed... menu item from the same menu.  This will pop up a dialog box asking what sort of palette you want to use for the image.  The default option should suffice.\nIf you don't need an indexed colour palette, I would just leave the image as RGB.  For many of the images people use PNG files for, the savings are small.\n\nA: As James Henstridge notes, your PNG image is probably in indexed color mode.  An indexed color image uses a specific limited color palette, and when editing such an image, GIMP will only use the colors available in the palette, mapping any other colors to the closest one in the palette.\nIn general, as James suggests, you'll need to convert the image to RGB color mode in order to freely edit it.  However, if you just want to replace a particular color with another one, everywhere it occurs in the image, then there's another option: you can edit the color palette itself by using the Colormap dialog.\nJust open the dialog (Windows → Dockable Dialogs → Colormap), double-click on the color you want to replace, and choose the new color you want in the color picker window that opens up.\nThe Colormap dialog also allows you to add new colors to the color palette, so that you can then draw using those new colors in the image (by first setting the color you want as the foreground color, and then clicking the  button in the Colormap dialog).  This can be useful if you e.g. want to replace only some pixels of a particular color with the new color.  However, note that indexed color mode (in GIMP, and also in the PNG format itself) only supports a maximum of 256 colormap entries.  If you need more colors than that, you'll have to convert the image to RGB mode anyway.\n\nA: The Fill tool mode can also be changed. Check \"Tool Options\" - \"Mode\" - \"Normal\"\n", "Q: How can I toggle between single and dual monitor setup? I have two monitors working just right with nvidia driver.\nThere are times, however, where I want to have just one monitor and other times where I need two: I must open NVidia XServer Settings, go to the XServer Display Configuration and change the second monitor from TwinView to Disabled (and vice-versa).\nIs there a way to just toggle that? For example having a shortcut on desktop and/or on the Unity dock? Maybe is there a way to configure a keyboard shortcut to achieve this?\nP.s.: I'm using 11.04 with Unity and, of course, Compiz.\n\nA: To toggle display modes I used disper \nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:disper-dev/ppa && sudo aptitude update && sudo aptitude install disper\n\nthen I added this python script, that is the indicator the better suits my needs, to my auto-run list.\nTo use that python script:\n\n\n*\n\n*download the script\n\n*symlink it to /usr/bin (for instance if you have the script in /home/foo/disper_ind.py you have to write on terminal sudo ln -s /home/foo/disper_ind.py /usr/bin/disper_ind.py\n\n*open \"start-up applications\", click \"Add\" and then put as command python /usr/bin/disper_indicator.py\n\nA: Have you tried using xrandr?

To make my question as simple as possible, I'll start with showing my desktop, so that I don't need to describe everything in words:\n\nBasically this is how I have been using Ubuntu 10.04 since it's been released: all ubuntu/gnome panels erased and only AWN (Awant Window Navigator) running on the left side of the screen.\nHow possible is it to get as close to this look as possible in Ubuntu 11.10 without downgrading to gnome 2?\nPossible solutions I can roughly think of, but am not sure how to accomplish them:\n1) Use Unity interface, hide the Unity launcher and try to get used to the necessary top panel (I don't think that can be erased, or can it?)\n2) Use Gnome interface and somehow erase all the panels/launchers?\n\nA: \nWell almost - once this bug is resolved then the top pesky nautilus menu-bar will disappear!\nHow to...\n\n\n*\n\n*Some prerequisites - install gnome-session-fallback & avant-window-navigator.\n\n*Logout and login with the new session \"gnome classic\"\n\n*start awn-settings and configure awn as you need to - ensure you tick the box to start awn automatically.\n\n*Run gnome-session-properties and add a new item compiz --replace\n\n*Edit /usr/share/gnome-session/sessions/gnome-classic.session and remove \"gnome-panel\"\n\n*Edit /usr/share/gnome-session/sessions/gnome-fallback.session and remove \"gnome-panel\"\n\n*Logout and login\n\n\nA: RiMMER, your desktop screenshot looks almost exactly like Unity except for a missing top-panel.\nTo change the default Unity to something more similar to your screenshot first install CompizConfig Settings Manager (CCSM).

It is non-intrusive, not very big, and actively participates in application functions (e.g., application menus and maximized-window-controls).\n\nA: I really dislike the new gnome user interface. I love the old classic look and feel so I went back with the help of the following question:\n\n\n*\n\n*How to revert to GNOME Classic Desktop?\nThen I alt + right clik each of the panel (top, right and bottom) and set their properties to autohide and once more my mind is at ease. Thus far, no errors and desktop makes sense again.\n\nA: You cannot remove the Unity Bars (you can in Unity 2D, but I wouldn't advise that). Your best bet is to install GNOME 3 and remove the panels, or create your own custom session.\nTo use GNOME 3, choose GNOME Classic from the login screen (not GNOME Shell) and alt+right click on the panels to get the regular menu (for editing).\n\nA: You could add insights to this bug that is very related to the top panel issue.\nhttps://bugs.launchpad.net/unity/+bug/853865\nDon't forget to press \"affects me too\"\n\nA: You might also try installing xubuntu, install AWN and finally removing the XFCE panels.  You will get something that nicely matches your desired end state with little effort.... you could do the same with lubuntu but personally I find Lubuntu's font rendering unacceptably poor.\nPerhaps the nicest approach though is to use Gnome Classic... disable Unity Menu from with CCSM and the set AWN or Docky or Cairo Dock or similar or pick up the desktop UI load.

If you want something more complex you can install DansGuardian or other filtering software.\nAnyway, the key aspect is to relegate your root access - with root access there's nothing you can't disable on the machine (unless, of course, if you can set up your local network so all traffic goes through another locked-down machine which runs filtering software in transparent proxy mode).\nUPDATE: It dawned on me that \"self control\" in the question title means \"SelfControl application for MacOSX\", not an act of somebody controlling themselves :) Well, I'm finding their claim that it can't be turned off implausible, provided the person has root access to the system. \nHowever, there seem to be a Linux port of the application:  SelfControl -- The Linux port - though, again, it doesn't (and can't) prevent somebody knowledgeable with root access from disabling/reverting the block.\nUPDATE2: Actually, if you have a look at SelfControl's source code, you'll find that it blocks sites by adding an entry to /etc/hosts, just as I suggested in the beginning :) My understanding is that Linix version uses iptables for that, which is kinda a bit more sophisticated but still is far from \"impossible to turn off\"\n\nA: There appears to be a SelfControl port to Linux here: http://svn.jklmnop.net/projects/SelfControl.html\n", "Q: Can I legally use Ubuntu Server to create a commercial web application on Amazon EC2? Based on Wikipedia Ubuntu is covered mainly under GNU GPL. In my company anything related to GPL means - can't be used, they are very afraid of legal traps related to GPL. \nThat's why I have this question: can Ubuntu Server on Amazon EC2 be used as a host OS for commercial web application? \nIf yes, is there any legal documents proving this? I found About Ubuntu Licensing. Is it enough to be sure my company is safe from any legal issues?\n\nA: Absolutely you can do this.  Many companies all over the world run a portion (sometimes all) of their commercial infrastructure on Linux distributions.  Ubuntu in this sense is no different from Red Hat, Debian, SUSE, and the rest.  \nJust because the kernel and many system components are under the GPL, that in no way means the code you run on top of it must also be free or open source software.  A simple search for commercial software and commercial web services that run on Linux will prove this quickly.\nOne simple example would be Google.  Virtually their entire server infrastructure runs on Linux, but clearly that hasn't forced them to give out the code to their web indexing software, or Gmail, or G+ (not to mention the entire Android platform which runs on Linux).\nAs for being sure enough to convince your legal department that it is ok to run Ubuntu Server, you might consider buying an Ubuntu Advantage support contract from Canonical.  They (ok, we) include legal indemnification with each support contract.  Please see:\nhttp://www.canonical.com/enterprise-services/ubuntu-advantage/assurance-terms\nhttp://www.canonical.com/enterprise-services/ubuntu-advantage/overview\nAlso: I didn't mention EC2 specifically because there is no reason to think that hosting it on EC2 would be any different compared with running it \"in house\" from a legal standpoint.\nAlso, too:  In the case of Android, let me clarify.  Android's modifications to the Linux kernel are GPL'd, however the rest of the platform is on a very permissive Apache-style license, and obviously a great many companies sell paid, closed-source software that runs on it.\n\nA: If you need to be really sure you need to contact a good lawyer who knows about the laws in your country.\nI'm nor a lawyer and I don't know about your country, but that's what I think:\nOn http://www.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/why-is-it-free Canonical writes that Ubuntu is Open Source, and on http://www.ubuntu.com/project/open-source they link to http://www.opensource.org/docs/definition.php for an explanation on what Open Source is. Point 6 in this list says:\n\nThe license must not restrict anyone from making use of the program in a specific \n  field of endeavor. For example, it may not restrict the program from being used in a \n  business, or from being used for genetic research.\n\nSo I'd say that Canonical thinks you are allowed to use Ubuntu as host OS.\n\nA: Do not know if it helps but you could take a look also to Ubuntu on EC2\n", "Q: How to combine an SSD boot drive with a HDD data drive?

As in Windows, I liked to have at least 2-3 Partitions example for music games programs and so on.\nWhich partition layout do you recommend to me?\n\nA: 64GB is more than enough for a root filesystem, a default installation will probably occupy about 3GB. When installing Ubuntu, choose for a custom partitioning scheme:\n\n\n*\n\n*Put a partition on your SSD with mount point /\n\n*On your 1 TB data disk, create a partition with /home\nVariations are possible.

In that case, create a partition (or folder) on your 1 TB disk named \"DATA\" (with /media/DATA as mount point). Then, move the ~/.wine folder to the data partition:\nmv ~/.wine /media/DATA/wine\n\nIf you've just installed the system and the folder did not exist yet, just create the empty folder:\nmkdir /media/DATA/wine\n\nNext, create a symbolic link from your home directory to the wine folder on the big disk:\nln -s /media/DATA/wine ~/.wine\n\nThe latter can also be performed after installation of Ubuntu to the SSD.

Think several years before Ipods. I never really had the need to burn too many cds. My girlfriend, however, keeps asking for cds for her cars cd player. I do have a huge collection. Most of which from artists who have a live recording policy. So sorry, no help on illegal downloads from me. So, can I give her great quality music, or will I need to convert these to mp3s?

However, when using konsole, all links open in konqueror, and not google-chrome!\nI've tried setting the default browser with: sudo update-alternatives --config 'x-www-browser'\nThis works for opening links in gnome-terminal, and other gnome programs... but not kde ones like konsole.  Also, there appears to be no kcontrol program for accessing the kde settings.\nDoes anyone know a way to set the kde setting for this while still using gnome?\nEDIT: From what I can tell, I've got all the related settings configured that I can think of...\ngrep 'chrome' ~/.local/share/applications/mimeapps.list\n\nx-scheme-handler/http=google-chrome.desktop;firefox.desktop;\nx-scheme-handler/https=google-chrome.desktop;firefox.desktop;\nx-scheme-handler/http=google-chrome.desktop\nx-scheme-handler/https=google-chrome.desktop\nx-scheme-handler/chrome=firefox.desktop\ntext/html=google-chrome.desktop\napplication/x-extension-htm=google-chrome.desktop;firefox.desktop;\napplication/x-extension-html=google-chrome.desktop;firefox.desktop;\napplication/x-extension-shtml=google-chrome.desktop;firefox.desktop;\napplication/xhtml+xml=google-chrome.desktop;firefox.desktop;\napplication/x-extension-xhtml=google-chrome.desktop;firefox.desktop;\napplication/x-extension-xht=google-chrome.desktop;firefox.desktop;\nx-scheme-handler/about=google-chrome.desktop\nx-scheme-handler/unknown=google-chrome.desktop\n\ngrep 'chrome' /usr/share/applications/defaults.list\n\ntext/html=firefox.desktop;google-chrome.desktop\ntext/xml=firefox.desktop;google-chrome.desktop\napplication/xhtml_xml=google-chrome.desktop\nx-scheme-handler/http=firefox.desktop;google-chrome.desktop\nx-scheme-handler/https=firefox.desktop;google-chrome.desktop\nx-scheme-handler/ftp=google-chrome.desktop\n\nAnd there are no references to konqueror:\ngrep -i 'konqueror' /usr/share/applications/defaults.list\ngrep -i 'konqueror' ~/.local/share/applications/mimeapps.list\ngrep -i 'kon' /usr/share/applications/defaults.list\ngrep -i 'kon' ~/.local/share/applications/mimeapps.list\n\n\nA: This is the correct behavior of Konsole. It opens links in the KDE default browser. If no browser is specified, it will launch Konqueror. Since you could not find any mentioning of Konqueror in the configuration files, the latter is exactly your case.\nTo set your preferred browser do the following (I assume that your Konsole and Konqueror are from KDE4):\n\n\n*\n\n*open KDE System Settings (e.g. by launching Kcontrol)\n\n*navigate to Default Applications (it must be somewhere under \"Workspace Appearance\")\n\n*find the Web Browser section\n\n*write the [path and] name of your preferred browser\n\n\nHope this helps.\n\nA: I ran into this problem running konsole in Ubuntu/Unity. When everything else failed, I edited ~/.kde/share/config/kdeglobals:\n[General]\nBrowserApplication[$e]=!google-chrome\n\nLogout, login -- bingo!\n\nA: The problem with \"default applications\" nowadays is that different programs look for the defaults in different ways. What we can call the traditional approach is $BROWSER and mailcap files.\nBut, recently, many graphical programs have started relying on .desktop files, and there is a set of xdg-* tools devoted to manipulate and retrieve some of the defaults.\nTry:\nxdg-settings get default-web-browser\n\nIf this shows konqueror, then \nxdg-settings set default-web-browser google-chrome.desktop\n\nShould fix it, at least if the xdg-settings documentation is to be trusted.\nNow, all that xdg-settings does is talking with the currently running desktop environment, so this should be GNOME, and it should be already set to google-chrome...\n\nA: The right way for me to make this work in ubuntu 18.04 was to add\n[General]\nBrowserApplication[$e]=!put-your-favorite-browser-here\n\nto ~/.config/kdeglobals as suggested here. After that you only need to start a new konsole.\n\nA: You can easily do this using 'Default Applications'. Simply search the name in the start menu to find the window.\nClick to see the image\n\nA: Check out this page: http://userbase.kde.org/System_Settings/Default_Applications\nThere is a kde system default settings application.

Problem is, that mails get marked as read when I select them and they are shown in the preview pane.\nI tried Thunderbird, Claws Mail and Sylpheed and I didn't find an option that prevents this. I'm open for new mail clients (but no console or KDE, please).\n\nA: Most clients have settings that allow the user to modify this behavior.  For example, in Thunderbird you can change these settings (under Edit | Preferences, then choose Advanced, and then the Reading and Display tab).  If \"Automatically mark messages as read\" is checked, you can uncheck it and the automatic marking won't happen, which sounds like what you want.\nIf you keep it checked, you can control the automatic marking with the two radio buttons beneath that line, either to mark a message as read immediately upon viewing (even in the preview pane), or to have it marked as read if you view the message - even in the preview pane - for a particular length of time.\nI know Evolution has a similar setting, and I assume most other mail clients do, too, but I'm not familiar with Claws Mail and with Sylpheed.\nIn Claws Mail, the settings controlling this behaviour are in the Preferences, Display / Summaries. The relevant options on this tab are the \"Open message when selected\" combo, and the \"Mark message as read\" settings.\n\nA: In Sylpheed, under the Configuration Menu -> Common Preferences choose the Details tab (right-most one), then under the Interface sub-tab uncheck Always mark as read when a message is opened.\n\n", "Q: My folders in the Ubuntu one cloud are empty, my control panel says I am using 947 MB I have not folders in the Ubuntu one cloud, my control panel says I am using 947 MB.\nHow can I fix this problem \n\nA: It is a bit difficult to tell why the reported usage is wrong from the information you've given.

I can connect from the inside just fine.\n\nA: If you can connect from your local network, Ubuntu most likely has nothing to do with it - it's a network configuration issue.\nMany ISPs block incoming connections on \"unusual\" ports (or all incoming connections). Some ISPs have a setting in their control panel enabling/disabling port blocking.\nAs a diagnostic - try exposing port 80 (Apache running some webpage) - I'm almost sure you'll find it doesn't work either.\nYou can also fiddle with modem settings (how do you know you forwarded \"the correct port\"?), but this would only help after you triple-checked your provider doesn't block you.\n\nA: For testing purpose, add another non standard listening port (say 2222) in /etc/ssh/sshd_config file, then do sudo service ssh restart and forward this port in your router too. Then try to ssh from outside with option -p2222. \n", "Q: How to access executable in a separate partition? \nPossible Duplicate:\nHow to 'chmod' on an NTFS partition? \n\nI have just started using Ubuntu and I have my hard drive set up with an Ubuntu partition, a Windows 7 partition and a much larger Storage partition where I keep most of my files.  \nI have been doing some programming and have been putting a.out into a folder in the Storage partition.  When I try to launch it in Bash I got a permission denied error.  I then did a sudo chmod +x a.out, but this did not give any feedback so I tried to launch a.out again and got permission denied.  I tried using the GUI to change a.out to executable but when I checked the box it unchecks right away.\nI did some googling and it seems that the partition itself needs to be given permission to execute.  So I did sudo chmod +x Storage and then I did ls -l and got:\ndrwx------ 1 jared jared 4096 2011-09-17 21:03 Storage\n\nWhen I go back to change a.out it still won't change.\nThis is the line from /proc/mounts for the file system:\n/dev/sda3 /media/Storage fuseblk   rw,nosuid,nodev,relatime,user_id=0,group_id=0,default_permissions,allow_other,blksize=4096 0 0\n\nI'm sure there is something about permissions I am misunderstanding so if some one could point me in the right direction it would be greatly appreciated.\n\nA: Bash scripts don't have to be executable, you just have to specify what to run them with. For example:\nbash ./script\n\nLinux permissions (aka chmod/chown) only work on Linux file systems. They won't work on NTFS or FAT32.\n\nA: Windows file systems (notably fat32 and ntfs) and some others do not have a right management like their linux counterparts. But even it that weren't so, sudo chmod +x Storge would not do much as it is just a folder in the file system hierarchy and folders are already executable. You'd need the recurse option chmod -R folder to set the permissions for all files in that folder. But again that won't work here either because there are not permissions to be set.\nHowever you can tell your system to mount the storage partition in a way that allows executing. For example my /etc/fstab entry for my windows partition looks like this:\n# Excerpt from /etc/fstab\nUUID=7258CB9858CB598D /media/win ntfs rw,auto,user,exec,nls=utf8,umask=003,gid=46,uid=1000    0   2\n\nNote in particular the umask and the exec option. gid and uid tell mount to which user the partition belongs to.\nMore information in these questions:\n\n\n*\n\n*How to automount NTFS partitions?\n\n*How do I give multiple users access to a Windows NTFS partition?\n", "Q: g++ behaving strangely with libssl I've been trying to use the RSA C library on a C++ application (since it seems like the proper way to do it, due to the lack of an \"official\" [read: OpenSSL] C++ implementation).

I know how to set Super_L (WinKey) button\nto open the menu.\ngconftool-2 --set /apps/metacity/global_keybindings/panel_main_menu --type string \"Super_L\"\n\nCurrently, in order to close that menu, I am having to mouse click outside the menu area. I need to use the Super_L as a toggle button. (pressing one time would open and pressing second time would close)\nSo what I need now is to be able to close it when pressing it second time.\n\nA: Unfortunanly, Gnome doesn't allow that.\nThey could have done a toggle to make it work.\n\nA: Since you already pressed a button to open the menu, your logical next step is to use the arrow keys to select an item and press enter. If you activated the menu for other, possibly illogical reasons, just press the give-up key which is unfortunately mislabeled as  Esc.\n", "Q: Sudoers permission without loging in as root I am a new user to Ubuntu 10.10\nMy problem is when I start my machine it takes me to login screen of Ubuntu\nbut I didn't get option for logging in as user or root\nI know my root password and all\neven cant make a ssh request\nI goggled it I got to know to press Alt+Ctrl+F1\nit takes me to login of user  \nin this user after logging I am unable to write sudo commands  \nAfter searching for a while I came to know that permission to sudo might be crating a problem\npermission to a sudo must be 440 I think which is 777 now\nHow to start up with my root access\n\nA: In Ubuntu, you generally never log in as root directly - especially you do not start an X session as root. Also, by default root password is not set/unknown so you can't log in directly as root.\nThe initial user created during Ubuntu installation has an ability to \"sudo\" - i.e.\nsudo apt-get update\n\nsudo then asks you for YOUR password, not root password. \nIn a terminal session, if you want to execute many commands as root (or maybe even start some graphical programs as root), you type\nsudo su\n\nand again enter YOUR password. This will start a root terminal session.\nThe \"original\" Ubuntu user can make other users \"admins\" so they can execute commands as root too.\nDoes it solve your problem?\n\nA: First of all if you haven't touched sudo or changed anything on /etc then its just your fear and you should read what Sergey has to say. Apart from that check if the file permission part is correct. Just do ls -l /etc | grep sudoers and see if the output is somthing like this: \n-r--r-----  1 root    root       574 2011-03-25 20:34 sudoers\n\nwhere -r--r----- part shows your permission to be 440 anything other than that should be changed to that as far as I know. If you can login as root on rescue mode, you can easily change file permission with  chmod 440 /etc/sudoers command. If you are not allowed sudo command at all you may need an external live-usb to recover. Content of /etc/sudoers or visudo should look like this[atleast in my case]:\n#\n# This file MUST be edited with the 'visudo' command as root.\n#\n# Please consider adding local content in /etc/sudoers.d/ instead of\n# directly modifying this file.\n#\n# See the man page for details on how to write a sudoers file.\n#\nDefaults    env_reset\n\n# Host alias specification\n\n# User alias specification\n\n# Cmnd alias specification\n\n# User privilege specification\nroot    ALL=(ALL:ALL) ALL\n\n# Members of the admin group may gain root privileges\n%admin ALL=(ALL) ALL\n\n# Allow members of group sudo to execute any command\n%sudo   ALL=(ALL:ALL) ALL\n\n#includedir /etc/sudoers.d\n\n\nA: I don't know how your sudo permission got messed up. This is what my permissions are for sudo and ls:\n-rwsr-xr-x 1 root root 168800 2011-04-15 21:32 /usr/bin/sudo\n-rwxr-xr-x 1 root root 105776 2011-02-23 19:54 /bin/ls\n\nThe key thing here is to have the setuid bit - which allows an application to change the user id: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Setuid Which might have been disabled.\nIf you need to restore sudo, you can boot Ubuntu into \"recovery mode\", where it should give you the ability to open up a root shell.\nIf you feel that your permissions might be messed up, I think running dpkg-reconfigure sudo while in recovery mode can help.\nAfter that, you can run visudo to open up the sudoers file and edit it to add your user.\n\nA: Assuming you've read the manual on sudo by typing in a prompt \n  'man sudo' and it really is broken the easiest way for a new user to fix almost anything is the reinstall. If you don't have the time or you have a lot installed already I recommend not using my answer.\n", "Q: No wireless detected, no drivers available I am running Ubuntu 11.04 32bit on a Lenovo E520 with a Intel WiFi Link 1000 BGN device.\nThough Windows7 can connect itself to WiFi as well as being able to see other WiFi networks, Ubuntu can not. \nWhen I went to additional driver, no drivers are on the list.\nHow can I connect my laptop to wireless network and use drivers in Ubuntu?\n\nA: I'm a bit late for this, but if someone arrives here looking for this question, here is the answer.

What are the differences of the Packages: libavcodec-extra-52, libavformat-extra-52, libavdevice-extra-52, libswscale-extra-0 in the Medibuntu and Multiverse repository?\n\nA: Most of the packages in Medibuntu are now obsolete, but the main difference between it and Multiverse is that Medibuntu contains packages that are legally tricky or not child friendly (for example there is a system monitor application that claims to show a person undressing - I've never used it so I have no clue).\nIt was once the case that you needed Medibuntu for adding support for many proprietary formats, and for playing some DVDs etc, and even for Adobe Acrobat Reader. However, most of these have been moved into either the Partner repository or the Multiverse.\nAs for the FFMPEG libraries, they are essentially the same libraries with different compilation options for legal reasons. Medibuntu's version should not be necessary any longer.\n", "Q: Why do *nix folk like to use ``...'' rather than the \" character? At the risk of being flamed, I'd like to understand why some people prefer to use a ``construction'' of accent and single quote characters rather than the \"double-quote\" character when quoting things?  \nExample:  \n\nWhy do some users write quotes using ``weird'' quotes?\n\nThis is not command-line wizardry; I see this in written texts that are intended for humans to read. Here's an example I could quickly dig up. \nI find this construction ugly because it's asymmetrical, and because it abuses typographical characters for a purpose they weren't meant for.\nFor some reason, this use of characters is mostly (exclusively?) done by Linux ((La)TeX?) users and not by the average computer user.\n\n\n*\n\n*If the intention is to create “curly quotes” then I don't get why only the opening quote is made \"curly\" using the grave accent (`) -- why is a plain apostrophe used for closing quotes, rather than the acute accent (´) which would make the whole thing symmetrical?\n\n*If the intention is to create “curly quotes” then why are actual curly quotes (as created by MS Word) frowned upon? Modern computer systems handle actual curly quotes well, so it can't simply be a tradition from the Gopher days, can it?\n\n*Why are two single characters used even though the same can be achieved with a single character?\n\nA: The real reason (and what may be the root cause of the LaTeX usage) is that many pre-unicode unix fonts (both for the console and X), and two common Adobe Postscript encoding vectors, had typographic opening/closing quote glyphs at these positions, so 'this' would look like ’this’, and ``this'' looked like ‘‘this’’ or ‛‛this’’, which was (especially in a proportional font where these were only 2-3 pixels wide) as close to typographically correct as you could get back then.\nThis goes back even further to typewriters, where the ' glyph would often be set at an angle to accomodate its use as an overstriking acute accent.\nSee also:\n\n\n*\n\n*http://www.cs.sfu.ca/~ggbaker/reference/characters/\n\n*http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~mgk25/ucs/quotes.html\n\nA: One reason is probably the influence of TEX to the Linux world. In most flavors of TEX, the sequence `` creates a typographically correct opening double quote (“) and '' (two single quotes) or \" create a typographically correct closing quote (”). So When you type\n``Why do you always say `shut up' to me?''\n\nIt actually yields \n\n“Why do you always say ‘shut up’ to me?”\n\nusing TEX. (Perhaps with better kerning, though).\n\nA: in *nix systems different quotes have different effects.\nusing e.g.\necho 'date'\n\nwill write\ndate\n\nto the output\necho `date`\n\nwill write e.g.\nTue Sep 20 13:42:04 CEST 2011\n\ninstead (so the output of the command \"date\")\nIn general your assumptions are wrong that quotes start with a different character than what they end with - they always have to be ended with the same as the one they have started with.\nFor e.g. the command \"echo\", you could also use multiple types of quotes. So let's say you want to show\n\"this is a test\"\n\non the console, you can write\necho '\"this is a test\"'\n\nYou can also swap these quotes to produce single quotes.\n", "Q: crosspaltformui problem with MTS Mblaze I have tried to install MTS Mblaze in my Karmic Koala.

As the xrandr manual says:\n\n--brightness brightness\nMultiply the gamma values on\nthe crtc currently attached to the output to specified\nfloating value. Useful for overly bright or overly dim\noutputs. However, this is a software only modification, if\nyour hardware has support to actually change the brightness,\nyou will probably prefer to use xbacklight.\n\nInstead, use xbacklight to change the brightness:\nxbacklight -get #get the current level\nxbacklight -set *percent* #set brightness to a given percentage\nxbacklight -inc *percent* #increase by a given percentage\nxbacklight -dec *percent* #decrease by a given percentage\n\nHowever, since this is same as using the laptop brightness keys, this cannot go beyond the limits of 0-100%. If you wish to brighten/darken your screen further than that limit, you can use xrandr to force software brightness levels:\nxrandr --output LVDS1 --brightness 0.5\n\nNote that xrandr accepts fractions (0.0-1.0) while xbacklight accepts percentages(0-100)\n\nA: Change VGA-1 with your device\nxrandr --listmonitors\nMonitors: 1\n\n0: +*VGA-1 1366/410x768/230+0+0  VGA-1\nxrandr --output VGA-1  --brightness 1   (for 100% brightness)\nxrandr --output VGA-1  --brightness 1.5 (for 150% brightness)\nxrandr --output VGA-1  --brightness 2   (for 200% or double brightness)\nxrandr --output VGA-1  --brightness 4 (for 400% brightness)\n\nCareful with 0 (you'll need to restart Xorg):\nxrandr --output VGA-1  --brightness 0 (for Blank Screen)\n\nxrandr --output VGA-1  --brightness 0.8 (for 80% brightness)\n\nThis works on normal lcd/led monitors as they do not support hardware brightness like laptops do.\n\nA: There's also DDC/CI, and linux client: ddccontrol (and, gddccontrol for GUI).\nTt's in official ubuntu repository:\nsudo apt install ddccontrol ddccontrol-db gddccontrol\n\n\nA: for monitor brightness, in gnome try https://github.com/fastrizwaan/gnome-set-brightness\ngsettings set org.gnome.desktop.a11y.magnifier mag-factor 1\ngsettings set org.gnome.desktop.a11y.magnifier brightness-red -0.5\ngsettings set org.gnome.desktop.a11y.magnifier brightness-green -0.5\ngsettings set org.gnome.desktop.a11y.magnifier brightness-blue -0.5\ngsettings set org.gnome.desktop.a11y.applications screen-magnifier-enabled true\n\n", "Q: How to enable 2D acceleration (preferably using proprietary graphics driver) on 32bit pae kernel?

I am buying a new video card and am now doubting between AMD and NVidia. As I won't be upgrading my processor and mainboard atm, but I want to play some bluray movies I think it is necessary that the video card can use hardware acceleration on Ubuntu.\nWith NVidia there is support as is for example demonstrated here with the libvdpau1 driver. Does similar things/drivers exist for the high-end AMD video cards like a HD6950?\n(Note that I personally do not require an open source driver. If a binary driver will work, that is okay for me)\n\nA: I spoke with AMD directly and learned that Yes, the HD6950 will support H.264 hardware acceleration on Ubuntu. Don't know the state of all AMD drivers but I was told the linux driver for Ubuntu that can be downloaded from the AMD website will get this done.\nSome other info:\nIn general, the Radeon cards do support 2D and 3D acceleration as documented here: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/RadeonDriver\nThe NVIDIA drivers have historically been said to run better with Linux. However, AMD has been putting a lot of work into their Open Source drivers for the last year or more and unlike NVIDIA they provide documentation, limited support, and an actual active development initiative for free software. So the community is vocal about supporting AMD video cards with \"your wallet.\"\nFor a comparison of AMD Radeon graphics cards, see this Phoronix article: http://www.phoronix.com/scan.php?page=article&item=amd_comp_oktoberfest&num=1\nBlu-ray playback can be a little tricky on Ubuntu. You can read more here: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/RestrictedFormats/BluRayAndHDDVD\n\nA: The Catalyst driver does provide that kind of acceleration through VA-API, but the challenge is that many programs do not take advantage of it. I believe Mplayer and VLC have the option to use VA-API, but Flash for example has not yet taken advantage of the support for this video acceleration API.\nIn terms of easier driver management, you might be better off with an ATI card, but in terms of better support for the latest video acceleration tech, then I would suggest nVidia. However, you can stick with ATI all the way if powerful graphics are your thing as well, as ATI (AMD) tends to be on top in terms of graphics (by just a minor edge).\nAgain, if you are looking for an easier, more well supported solution, then nVidia is the better choice.\n", "Q: Trouble with bash and crontab \nPossible Duplicate:\nReasons why crontab does not work \n\nI'm migrating some scripts from an older machine to a lucid ec2 machine.\nI'm sourcing a file in our ~/.bashrc and setting some environment variables, but those variables don't seem to be accessible from any cron.\nEven though my cron has a . /home/username/.bashrc && /path/to/script the script doesn't seem to know of any of the environment variables which is in another file and sourced in ~/.bashrc.\nAll of these scripts work successfully when I run them from the command line.

Memory leak?\n\nA: Judging from the comments, you are using too many heavy applications at once. With so little RAM I suggest running fewer applications when using Eclipse and other heavy (especially interpreted) applications. Naturally most applications will slowly but surely increase the memory usage until you start to experience thrashing. To avoid this, restart the applications from time to time. If you are running Unity, you can also restart unity easily. Just run unity in the run dialogue to restart it. It will restart compiz as well, and free some memory.\n", "Q: AT3IONT3-I Boot from USB I'm trying to get my HTPC I've built to run ubuntu.

I have a Laptop with multiple outputs and use an external monitor pretty often. If I want to activate it, I have to go to system menu --> Displays and activate the external display. After using, I need to deactivate it with the same menu.\nIn Windows, I could do the same by simply pressing Win+P (Meta+P). Is there any hotkey or other way to achieve this behaviour in Unity (Ubuntu 11.04/11.10)? On a side-note, my laptop does have a button to switch output modes, but does not work (just opens the unity menu bar - I suspect it's a shortcut for Meta+P internally).\nAddendum: The Laptop in question is a Dell Studio XPS 1640.\nAddendum 2:\nI've did some more research. xev gives me the following statement when pressing the \"change CRT/LCD\"-Button:\nKeymapNotify event, serial 33, synthetic NO, window 0x0,\n    keys:  2   0   0   0   0   0   0   0   0   0   0   0   0   0   0   0   \n           0   0   0   0   0   0   0   0   0   0   0   0   0   0   0   0   \n\nIn tty1, the command showkey gives me the following output:\nkey 125 pressed\nkey  25 pressed\nkey  25 released\nkey 125 released\nkey  28 pressed\n\nAlternative output via showkey -s:\n0xe0 0x5b 0x19 0x99 0xe0 0xdb\n0x1c\n\nThe last line takes a second to show - I guess it refers to the enter-key. A quick look into dumpkeys|grep ^keycode reveals 125=ALT and 25=p. Looking in /lib/udev/keymaps/dell, the code for switching the video mode is set to 0x9B:\n0x9B switchvideomode # Display Toggle button\n\nNow, from what I see, the display-button is not mapped to a single key but to a key burst... any idea how to tackle the problem further is greatly appreciated.\n\nA: If you have a Fn key on your keyboard, chances are good that some of the remotely intelligible glyphs in the same distinct color as the 'Fn' key already accomplish what you seek for, you'll just have to hold Fn and press F10.\nFor this to work, your laptop vendor must have its entry at /lib/udev/keymaps and udev must correctly detect your keyboard type.\nFor example, doing a grep -r switchvideomode there yields:\n\n./module-lenovo:0x6 switchvideomode # Fn+F7\n./acer:0xA9 switchvideomode # Fn+F5\n./samsung-other:0x82 switchvideomode # Fn+F4 CRT/LCD (high keycode: \"displaytoggle\")\n./fujitsu-amilo_pro_edition_v3505:0xA9 switchvideomode # Fn-F3\n./fujitsu-esprimo_mobile_v5:0xA9 switchvideomode\n./module-sony-vgn:0x11 switchvideomode # Fn+F7\n./module-sony:0x0B switchvideomode # Fn+F7\n./dell:0x8B switchvideomode # Fn+F8 CRT/LCD (high keycode: \"displaytoggle\")\n./dell:0x8F switchvideomode # Fn+F7 aspect ratio\n./dell:0x9B switchvideomode # Display Toggle button\n./olpc-xo:0x69 switchvideomode # Brightness key\n./module-ibm:0x06 switchvideomode # Fn+F7\n./oqo-model2:0xF0 switchvideomode\n./onkyo:0xF5 switchvideomode # Fn+E\n./lenovo-thinkpad-usb-keyboard-trackpoint:0x90016 switchvideomode # Fn+F7\n./zepto-znote:0x93 switchvideomode    # Fn+F3 Toggle Video Output\n./ibm-thinkpad-usb-keyboard-trackpoint:0x900f2 switchvideomode\n./fujitsu-amilo_pro_v3205:0xF7 switchvideomode # Fn+F3\n./lenovo-3000:0x8B switchvideomode # Fn+F7 video\n./hewlett-packard:0xEE switchvideomode # FnF4\n\nOtherwise, you can write your own taking the nearest match as a template and maybe submit it to canonical's laptop testers for inclusion.\n\nA: Not sure if it's the same in Ubuntu, but in Debian KDE it goes like this:\nSystem Settings -> Shortcuts & Gestures -> Global Keyboard Shortcuts -> KDE Daemon (from drop down list) -> Switch Display - map to Win + P or whatever you want.\n\nA: You can probably get your fn + display key to work if you boot with\nacpi_osi=Linux\n\nor\nacpi_osi='Windows 2006'\n\nYour BIOS probably thinks that you're running Windows 7, so it maps your fn + display key to Windows + P. With the above kernel parameter, you can  tell the BIOS that you're running Linux or Windows Vista (which doesn't support Windows + P) and it hopefully won't map to Windows + P.\nTo do this, when you turn on your computer, press E. You will see a screen like this:\n\nPress the down arrow until you reach the line that begins with \"linux\" then press the End key to put the cursor at the end of the line. Then type in either of the above parameters (not both).\nIf that works, then you can change the following line in /etc/default/grub:\nGRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT=\"quiet splash\"\n\nto\nGRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT=\"quiet splash acpi_osi='The one you chose'\"\n\n\nA: Long time no see. \nWith Ubuntu 13.10, the normal Switch Display button of my Dell Studio XPS 1640 does work out of the box, although some weird behaviour happens with the Keys sent by this command (e.g. a lot of enter keys and being unable to use the main system menu in the right upper corner).\nAnother solution I found is to map a key (e.g. Win+P) to xrandr --auto in the keyboard shortcuts of the system settings.\n", "Q: How can I connect to PPPOE over Wifi?

It's the .raw files of photos I took last year, so it's not a folder that will change, so incremental backups isn't an issue. All I'd like is a simple way to back up the folder to a number of DVDs. What program is best for this sort of task?\nA lot of the backup programs seem to be more about incremental backups and so forth, which I'm not interested in. I'd like the program to automatically break down the folder into chunks that can be written to DVD.\n\nA: DAR: Disk ARchive\n\ndar is a shell command that backs up directory trees and files\n\nIn summary - it can archive any folder tree and write slices - where each slice can be burned to disk using your favourite disk burner.\nThe advantage is that not all the slices need to be written out at once - while archiving, DAR will pause for you to write the slice before continuing.\nHow to install\nsudo apt-get install dar\n\nHow to archive\ndar -c /home/dad/test/archive -s 4700M -S 4695M -p -b -z -R /home/dad/Downloads -D\n\nIn this example, DAR will write a slice called \"archive\" of size 4695MB to the folder /home/dad/test.  The folder /home/dad/Downloads and everything in that folder including subfolders are compressed into each slice.\nAfter each slice is written you write the file to DVD before deleting it.\nHow to list the contents\nUse the format:\ndar -l [name of archive]\n\ne.g. \ncd /media/cdrom\ndar -l archive\n\nHow to extract individual files\nUse the format:\ndar -R [folder to extract to] -x [archive name] -g [file to extract]\n\nfor example:\ndar -R . -x /media/cdrom/archive -g filetoextract.txt\n\n\nMore information, examples and tutorials: http://dar.linux.free.fr/doc/Tutorial.html\n\nA: *\n\n*Right click on the folder and choose Compress....\n\n*Choose the .7z extension. If it's not there, install the p7zip-full package.\n\n*Choose Other options and tick the Split into volumes option.\n\n\nA: Not the best solution, as it's not automated, but since it's a fairly small number of DVDs that will be required (4-5), you could simply manually split the folder into chunks small enough to burn.\n", "Q: How can I tell if I installed with wubi? It sounds odd, but I really can not remember how I installed my ubuntu.\nWhat I am sure is, I had Windows 7 installed on the laptop in the very beginning, then I installed ubuntu so that this is a dual system 1 year ago.\nI need to know if the ubuntu was installed with wubi or not, because it determines how I could resize the partition of ubuntu...\nCould anyone help? Thank you very much!\n\nA: Unless it's changed since I last tried Wubi,  if you installed via Wubi, if you check 'Programs and Features' in Control Panel in Windows 7 you will see Ubuntu (or Wubi?) listed as a program in the add/remove programs list like all of your other programs. \n\nA: Wubi will show two boot managers. First the Windows one, then GRUB. Plain Ubuntu just GRUB.\nUnder Ubuntu there is also a /host folder, that will link to the drive where you installed the WUBI image.\n\nA: Boot into Windows>Click on Computer>Now on the drive where you have installed Windows >Do you see any ubuntu folders?\nIf you don't, then you didn't installed Ubuntu via Wubi\nIf you do, then you did installed Ubuntu via Wubi.\n\nA: From Windows\nYou should have a C:\\ubuntu\\disks folder and into this a file root.disk.\nThe drive is not necessarily the C:, look for it in every volume known to Windows.\nFrom Ubuntu\nThe command mount | grep ^/dev should return an output similar to\n/dev/loop0 on / type ext4 (rw,errors=remount-ro,commit=0)\n/dev/sda2 on /host type fuseblk (rw,nosuid,nodev,relatime,user_id=0,group_id=0,allow_other,blksize=4096)\n\nIn particular a loop device mounted on the root partition (the /), and a real partition mounted on /host.\n\nA: if you only have ntfs or fat32 partitions and no Linux partitions like etx2, ext3 or ext4 then you have installed with Wubi. Windows would report Linux partitions like \"Unrecognized partition\" or similar so if you don't have any of those, Wubi was used.\n\nA: Open the Windows Control Panel. Search for “Wubi”. If it’s there, then you have used Wubi.\nAlternatively, check for Wubi in the list of installed programs. It shows up as “Ubuntu”:\n\n\nA: you open wubi. if it says to uninstall, you used wubi.\n", "Q: Reassign keyboard shortcuts for Unity \"launcher\"? \nPossible Duplicate:\nCan I define keyboard shortcuts using the Super key? \n\nHow can I reassign the keyboard shortcuts for the Unity \"launcher\" (in Ubuntu 11.10beta1)  By default, the applications in the launcher are assigned Super-1, Super-2, etc.  I would like to use those key combinations for more common activities, and so would like to set the launcher to use Shift-Super-1, etc.  I can not find any configuration setting in Unity or the Compiz Settings Manager.\n\nA: I believe these shortcuts are hardcoded into Unity in Ubuntu 11.10, so without editing the source code and recompiling, this won't be possible.\n", "Q: Why is it necessary to add locally attached printers? I seldom have to print anything on paper anymore, so my knowledge about printers is really limited. Last weekend, I demoed Oneiric to my father, who still prints stuff, and even though his printer is attached using USB, I had to select the printer from a list. Why is that? I mean, if I attach a memory stick, I don't have to select it. It just works. Why is that no so with printers? For network printers, I understand why they have to be added, since a company can have thousands of printers when one user only needs to use a couple of them. But shouldn't directly connected printers just work? \n\nA: According to Ubuntu docs, things are supposed to happen exactly as you expect: \n\nPlug your printer into your computer and power it on. Most printers\n  will automatically be detected an configured. Once detected, a printer\n  icon will appear in the notification area and after waiting a few\n  moments, you should get a popup with the text \"Printer is ready for\n  printing.\n\nUnfortunately, setting up a printer may be more difficult than mounting a flash drive, so sometimes auto-detection fails. In this case you need to add the printer manually.\n\nA: You could always print to a file instead, or tell the system to use  a printer in the network, which isn't automatically seen. \nAnd since Linux evolved from a networking-server-system, having multiple printers available was very common for Unix systems.\n", "Q: Puppet server cannot find certificate request when importing certificate I am trying to install puppet server and client in two Ubuntu 10.04. one Ubuntu server which has puppet master and Ubuntu client which has puppet client.\n**I referred the below link for installation** \n\ninstalling and configuring puppet \nI dont have a DNS server so i had added host entry in both server and client.\nWhen i am importing certificate\nsudo puppetca --sign meercat02.example.com\ni am getting error\nerr could not call sign could not find certificate request\n\nA: Deepak, you need to replace 'meercat02.example.com' with your actual host name.\nYou can get a list of the certificates waiting to be signed with\npuppet cert --list\n\nOn the puppet master. You should see your puppet client listed there and you can then run\nsudo puppetca --sign whatever.your.hostname.is\n\nIf you don't see the client's hostname, then you may want to verify that the hosts entries you created are correct.\n", "Q: NetworkManager - if-down.d script does not execute I am trying to use /etc/network/if-up.d/ and /etc/network/if-down.d to send an SMS from my computer to my phone via Gmail whenever my computer enters or exits a wireless network. The main script is written in Perl, and the scripts in said folders are essentially wrappers around it. Here is the Perl script, ~user/bin/laptopSMS.pl:\n#!/usr/bin/perl\n\nuse strict;\nuse warnings;\n\nuse Email::Send;\nuse Email::Send::Gmail;\nuse Email::Simple::Creator;\n\nmy $addy = q{myEmail@gmail.com};\nmy $pass  = q{myPass};\nmy $sms   = q{myPhoneNumber@tmomail.net};\n\nmy $email = Email::Simple->create(\n   header => [\n          From    => $addy,\n              To      => $sms,\n          Subject => \"$ARGV[0]\",\n  ],\n  body => \"$ARGV[1] / $ARGV[2]\",\n);\n\nmy $sender = Email::Send->new(\n    {     mailer      => 'Gmail',\n          mailer_args => [\n              username => $addy,\n              password => $pass,\n          ]\n    }\n );\neval { $sender->send($email) };\ndie \"Error sending email: $@\" if $@;\n\nThe following script is /etc/network/if-up.d/99postconnect_laptopSMS:\n#!/bin/bash\n\nset -e\n\nif [ \"$IFACE\" == \"wlan0\" ]; then\n    ipaddr=`ip addr | grep inet[^6] | grep -v 127.0.0.1 | awk {'print $2'} | sed 's!/[0-9]*!!g'`\n    ssid=`iwgetid -r`\n    ~user/bin/laptopSMS.pl \"connected\" \"$ssid\" \"$ipaddr\"\nfi\n\nThis works fine, and I get a text message whenever my phone enters a network; the corresponding if-down.d script to send a \"disconnect\" signal, however, does not:\n#!/bin/bash\n\nset -e\n\nif [ \"$IFACE\" == \"wlan0\" ]; then\n    ~user/bin/laptopSMS.pl \"disconnect\" \"disconnect\" \"disconnect\"\nfi\n\nThis is not executing; I tried to put the following snippet into the script to see if anything is actually running:\nifdowntest=/home/user/ifdown_test.txt\ndate >> $ifdowntest\nwhoami >> $ifdowntest\nifconfig >> $ifdowntest\nsleep 5\n\nLeaving this in the script by itself executes just fine, but appending it to the wrapper to the Perl script does not. (No file is generated.)\nThe output of ifconfig >> $ifdowntest shows that wlan0 does not have an IP - it's been taken down. Can I get this script to execute pre-down (I thought that's what the if-down.d folder did) or somehow edit something to make this work? Note that it takes about 3 seconds for the Perl script to fire when running it manually.\nFWIW: I'm taking down the network manually by clicking the NetworkManager applet and clicking \"Disconnect\". I could potentially just kill my router to test that too, but I don't know if there's a difference between manually disconnecting and the AP no longer existing.\n\nA: Try to move your \"disconnect\" script to /etc/network/if-post-down.d, that's the directory that should actually get run when NetworkManager disconnects, rather than if-down.d (which would mean triggering something as the device goes down, not when it just disconnected). For what you're trying to achieve, it shouldn't be an issue, and in fact avoid trying to send the SMS via network while the default gateway might not yet have been updated.\nThis obviously assumes you then still have another connection (wired) to send the SMS over. Anything else is too uncertain and unreliable to be worth using (you can't expect the wireless connection to be working enough by the time the scripts are run to send an SMS over it).\nIf you want to investigate further into this, you can look at /etc/NetworkManager/dispatcher.d/01ifupdown.\n", "Q: Dual boot ubuntu 11.04 and fedora 15 I want make dual boot with feodra 15 and ubuntu 11.04 for testing features,please guide me the same.\n         i had done dual boot with windows and linux but not linux linux.\n\nA: You may check this article: Dual-boot Fedora 15 and Ubuntu 11.04 with either side on an LVM partitioning scheme It very detail article.

I have a bash-script for installing Firefox which is downloaded and executed from every client workstation in the network. The script is on the server and all workstations are running Ubuntu. Now I want all workstations to have some default predefined bookmarks like company website etc. There is a way to do that by modifying the omni.jar file which is in the installation folder of Firefox but I could not find a working solution to do that. \nHow can I provide some bookmarks for all users?\n\nA: You will find your bookmarks in a private folder inside of  .mozilla/firefox/ called places.sqlite - that holds the bookmarks.

Change this value in order to adjust it to your needs.\nIf you wish a screenshot of the current terminal window simply drop the gnome-panel-screenshot -window or gnome-panel-screenshot -w without any other parameters, for the whole screen drop no parameters at all.\nFor a guided screenshot grabbing simply drop the gnome-panel-screenshot -i command in a terminal which will produce this window:\n\nBTW: You don't need to drop this last one in a terminal, simply hit the AltF2 keys and enter it in the \"Run application\" dialog window. After which you can choose whatever options that better fits your needs for screen-shooting.\n\nGood luck!\n\nA: There are some ways to grab the terminal without any borders and menus like for example: Say you have 2 Terminal opens, one you renamed to Terminal R2D2 and the other to Terminal C3PO if you wanted a screenshot for each you would go to each terminal and run the command import with the following data:\nInside any Terminal:\nimport -windows \"Terminal R2D2\" R2D2Test.jpg\nInside any Terminal:\nimport -windows \"Terminal C3PO\" C3POTest.jpg\nThis will capture your terminal window with the Title you mention. Noticed you can capture any window. In this case is only the terminal windows or any amount of terminal windows.\nYou need to specify a title for your terminal by going in the terminal menu to Terminal -> Title\nNOTE - The MenuBar will show in the screenshots if you do not disable it from the Menu. Go to View -> Show MenuBar to disable it. To enable just right click the Terminal and select Show MenuBar.\nI did not mention Shutter, Ksnapshot or the commong ALT+PrtScrn options since you want a specific terminal way that does not capture borders or mouse pointers.\n\nA: You might consider using scrot\nsudo apt-get install scrot\nscrot -s -b other-terminal-window.png\n\nYou still need to click on the other terminal window though.\n\nA: The shortcut key to capture a window is Alt+PrtScr. The shortcut key to capture the whole desktop is PrtScr. You could also try a tool for taking screenshots like Shutter \n", "Q: How to remove transparency in KDE without disabling all desktop effects? I don't understand the hype for transparency. From a usability standpoint I see no argument whatsoever that transparency should enhance your productivity or improve your workflow. Any element on top of another one is inevitabily more ditracting and takes longer to grasp than a single clean and well designed element. True, it's much more complex to design consistent and meaningful elements, panels, symbols and windows without any transparency. \nStill I want to remove transparency from KDE 4.7 without disabling desktop effects alltogether. Since I don't find an opaque theme I would like to use (hints are welcome!) I want to disable the transparency within existing themes.

Only preset options is \"basic (with no staple), 2 sided, 2 sided with staple, and landscape.  Occasionally there appears and \"unregistered\" option.  Is it possible to change the default on the unregistered option?\n\nA: Chances are very small that you encounter anyone with the same printer here, so I'll give a generic advice: try looking in the directory /etc/cups/ppd/. Most likely you will find a ppd file which corresponds to your printer. Different outputmodes may be defined in that file, and you could (after saving a backup copy of the original file) try to add a line which does what you want if the syntax of the other modes is clear.\n", "Q: Ubuntu will not shutdown I have installed Ubuntu as wubi (next to windows 7).

How can I join these files?\nI have plenty of space on that disk for the files (>50GB). I read somewhere that I should pipe the files contents in real time to avoid this error but I have no idea how to do it.\n\nA: Wich if the format of your external drive?\nSome drives use FAT32, and this limit the maximun file size close to 4Gb.\nIf you want to have bigger files you should change it. To do this you have to format the external drive.\n\nA: The easiest solution would be to output the cat into an external hard drive with a format other than FAT32. You can simply reformat a USB stick >8GB and output the cat in there.\nI am afraid but you won't be able to handle >4GB files in a FAT32 hard drive. \nYou can find further information about file systems and their limitations here: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_file_systems#Limits\n", "Q: It's possible to change preview size in thunar?

I have troubles getting my Ubuntu One contacts into Evolution. I have set up everything one the u1 dashboard, but when selecting this address book in evolution I get a message telling me that it could not display this address book because of an invalid url or due the inviability of the server. Next to details, it mentions that it has an invalid source.

So I assume this would be solved by now, or is it?\nCould someone tell me how to get things work please?\n\nA: The UbuntuOne contacts in evolution use a couchdb file (desktopcouch) which is normally hidden from you.

It's OK for me but if it's no good on your screen, you should be able to change the colours by going to Window > Preferences > General > Appearance > Colors and Fonts and changing either or both of 'Content Assist background color', 'Content Assist foreground color'. But it doesn't look like you can separately control the colours for highlighted and other lines.\n\nA: When using the default Ubuntu 12.04 Ambiance colour scheme I changed tooltip background colour to tooltip_bg_color:#7F7F7F allowing inspector popup windows to show visible text:\nsudo gedit /usr/share/themes/Ambiance/gtk-2.0/gtkrc\n\ngtk-color-scheme = \"base_color:#ffffff\\nfg_color:#4c4c4c\\ntooltip_fg_color:#ffffff\\nselected_bg_color:#f07746\\nselected_fg_color:#FFFFFF\\ntext_color:#3C3C3C\\nbg_color:#F2F1F0\\ntooltip_bg_color:#7F7F7F\\nlink_color:#DD4814\"\n\nLog out of ubuntu and log back in to see the effect\nFor more of a Ubuntu experience try using #DA8C6D as the new background colour.\n\nA: This might be a dumb answer but... is it possible that the font color is set to white so you can't actually see anything?

I could not copy those files too.\nWhat is the command line arguments should I use to skip the damaged file and copy healthy files.\n\nA: If you're unable to copy file by file, use ddrescue to copy the entire partition block by block. ddrescue will just copy the good blocks, leaving the space in the image file where the bad blocks were.\nGeneral usage is like this:\nsudo ddrescue -n /dev/sda1 sda1.img sda1.log\nsudo ddrescue -r3 /dev/sda1 sda1.img sda1.log \n\nThis will copy the entire partition /dev/sda1 to an image file sda1.img. This should be done from a different partition which has enough room for the entire partition image.\nThe second command will attempt to read from the bad blocks again and fill in the blanks.\nThen you can mount the img file and do what you want with the files on them:\nsudo mount sda1.img -o loop /mnt; nautilus /mnt\n\nMore info:\nhttp://wiki.lunarsoft.net/wiki/Data_Recovery#ddrescue\nhttp://www.gnu.org/software/ddrescue/manual/ddrescue_manual.html\n\nA: If you know the exact files/directories you want to copy, you could try to run this from the terminal:\ncp /media/name-of-hdd/folder-files-to-copy ~/Desktop/\n\n", "Q: Why does upstart keep respawning my process?

From init(5):\n\n   respawn\n         A service or task with this stanza will be automatically started\n         if it should stop abnormally.  All reasons for a service stopping,\n         except the stop(8) command itself, are considered abnormal.  Tasks\n         may exit with a zero exit status to prevent being respawned.\n\n\nThe documentation is a little unclear on the point of whether exiting with a zero exit status should cause a respawn.  However, fundamentally you've found an upstart bug because the main process ending when the goal is 'stop' should not result in a change to 'respawn'.\nTo work around this bug, you should be able to use \"normal exit\" to tell upstart that this is a normal way to stop the job and that it should not respawn.\n\n  normal exit STATUS|SIGNAL...\n         Additional exit statuses or even signals may be added, if the\n         job process terminates with any of these it will not be considered\n         to have failed and will not be respawned.\n\n         normal exit 0 1 TERM HUP\n\n\nNote that in general, it would be more robust to kill the process with a signal (specifying \"kill signal N\" if necessary) instead of with a pre-stop process that issues commands; but of course this is not always possible if the service doesn't support clean shutdown upon receipt of a signal.\n\nA: A fix was released in upstart 1.10 for this, so now it shouldn't happen.\n", "Q: How to tunnel traffic from one machine to another?

On the Server use\nssh -L 4444:local_machine_name:5555 user@local_machine_name \n\nor on the local machine use\nssh -R 4444:localhost:5555 user@server_machine_name \n\n(In the first example you could connect to any other machine, no need to connect to local_machine_name, you could just use localhost to connect to the server itself).\nAnother more complex way is to use the server as a router. See https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Router and especially https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Router#Enable_IP_forwarding_and_Masquerading.\nThis is what most small cable or DSL home router do.  \n\nA: This is possible using iptables.

I have not been able to locate the installation of Groovy installed under STS.\nHow can I find the path for GROOVY_HOME?\n\nA: If you install it via apt-get, you may not need to set that.  I checked and groovy/groovyConsole seem to run properly.\nIf you do need to set it GROOVY_HOME should be /usr/share/groovy.\nI've never used it, but I figured it out by looking at this.  It tells you that GROOVY_HOME should have subdirectory of ./bin.\nAfter the apt-get install groovy && sudo updatedb && locate groovy | grep /usr | grep bin it definitely looks right.\nIf you used a binary installer or put it somewhere else, those steps should help you find it.\n", "Q: 10.04 LTS SVN how quick are updates? I am new to Ubuntu LTS.  I am using the SVN server that comes with 10.04 it is 1.6.6.  The current version is 1.6.17. How quickly can I expect an update to the LTS applications?\n\nA: Generally the LTS will not get new versions of applications, but rather security patches and bugfixes to current package version - the version number will likely never change, however there could be new features backported, but not likely. Your best bet would be the Subversion PPA but that only goes to 1.6.17. \n\n\n*\n\n*What are PPAs and how do I use them?\nIf you are wanting something newer than than, you will likely have to install from source unfortunately.\n\nA: Important security bugfix updates you can expect very quickly, but it will be on base of 1.6.6 (base vesrion for this release) with merged only security changes, so you will have package version like: 1.6.6dfsg-2ubuntu1.3. See changelog.\nSo, if you care about security, stick with normal package from normal repo. \nIf you care about some new features, you need to:\n\n\n*\n\n*compile it by your self (and take care about updates by your self!), or \n\n*install some PPA package without support, or \n\n*install package from newer ubuntu release\n\n\nAll of above are messy - do you really want it? \n", "Q: Remove the shortcut of an application that was installed using Wine from the Unity Dash How do I remove an application shortcut from the Unity Dash (not from the Unity Launcher)?\nMy specific issue is I tried to install a game using Wine a while ago.

The Unity/gtk volume manager that comes with vanilla Ubuntu lets you increase the volume past 100%, which is useful for hearing quiet youtube videos.

In few of the earlier versions, configuration of of the same had a \"Maximum volume\" field.\n\n\nA: The best solution for this (in my case, as all the volumes in alsamixer were to the maximum) was using Veromix.\nFirst install python script engine, sudo apt-get install plasma-scriptengine-python. Then right click your destop and select the option add widgets. Select the option \"Get new Windgets\" and \"Download new plasma widgets\", then in the search box type in \"Veromix\".\n\nOnce you have it, add it to your desktop or to a panel, and go to veromix settings, select PulseAudio tab and select the higher volume range that you want (up to 255% is allowed, it is not recommended going higher than 200 as that may damage the speakers).

Is there a way to change the date when a file was modified/created (which is shown in Nautilus or with the ls -l command)? Ideally I am looking for a command which can change the date/time stamps of a whole bunch of files to a certain amount of time earlier or later (e.g. +8 hours or -4 days etc.). \n\nA: Thanks for the help.\nThis worked for me:\nIn the terminal go to the directory for date-edit.\nThen type:\nfind -print | while read filename; do\n    # do whatever you want with the file\n    touch -t 201203101513 \"$filename\"\ndone\n\nYou wil see a \">\" after you hit enter, exept for the last time -> \"done\".\nNote:\nYou may want to change \"201203101513\"\n\"201203101513\" = is the date you want for all the files in this directory.\n\nA: As long as you are the owner of the file (or root), you can change the modification time of a file using the touch command:\ntouch filename\n\nBy default this will set the file's modification time to the current time, but there are a number of flags, such as the -d flag to pick a particular date.  So for example, to set a file as being modified two hours before the present, you could use the following:\ntouch -d \"2 hours ago\" filename\n\nIf you want to modify the file relative to its existing modification time instead, the following should do the trick:\ntouch -d \"$(date -R -r filename) - 2 hours\" filename\n\nIf you want to modify a large number of files, you could use the following:\nfind DIRECTORY -print | while read filename; do\n    # do whatever you want with the file\n    touch -d \"$(date -R -r \"$filename\") - 2 hours\" \"$filename\"\ndone\n\nYou can change the arguments to find to select only the files you are interested in.  If you only want to update the file modification times relative to the present time, you can simplify this to:\nfind DIRECTORY -exec touch -d \"2 hours ago\" {} +\n\nThis form isn't possible with the file time relative version because it uses the shell to form the arguments to touch.\nAs far as the creation time goes, most Linux file systems do not keep track of this value.  There is a ctime associated with files, but it tracks when the file metadata was last changed.  If the file never has its permissions changed, it might happen to hold the creation time, but this is a coincidence.  Explicitly changing the file modification time counts as a metadata change, so will also have the side effect of updating the ctime.\n\nA: This little script at least works for me:\n#!/bin/bash\n\n# find specific files\nfiles=$(find . -type f -name '*.JPG')\n\n# use newline as file separator (handle spaces in filenames)\nIFS=$'\\n'\n\nfor f in ${files}\ndo\n # read file modification date using stat as seconds\n # adjust date backwards (1 month) using date and print in correct format \n # change file time using touch\n touch -t $(date -v -1m -r $(stat -f %m  \"${f}\") +%Y%m%d%H%M.%S) \"${f}\"\ndone\n\n\nA: It's been a long time since I wrote any kind of Unix program, but I accidentally set the year incorrectly on a bunch of Christmas photos, and I knew if I didn't change the date from 2015 to 2014 it would be a problem later on.\nMaybe, this is an easy task, but I didn't find any simple way to do it.\nI modified a script I found here, which originally was used to modify the date by minus one month.\nHere's the original script:\n#!/bin/bash\n\n# find specific files\nfiles=$(find . -type f -name '*.JPG')\n\n# use newline as file separator (handle spaces in filenames)\nIFS=$'\\n'\n\nfor f in ${files}\ndo\n # read file modification date using stat as seconds\n # adjust date backwards (1 month) using date and print in correct format \n # change file time using touch\n touch -t $(date -v -1m -r $(stat -f %m  \"${f}\") +%Y%m%d%H%M.%S) \"${f}\"\ndone\n\nHere's my modified script that forced the date to the year \"2014\":\n#!/bin/bash \n\n# find specific files\n#files=$(find . -type f -name '*.JPG')\n\n# use newline as file separator (handle spaces in filenames)\nIFS=$'\\n'\n\nfor f in $*\ndo\n # read file modification date using stat as seconds\n # adjust date backwards (1 month) using date and print in correct format \n # change file time using touch\n touch -t $(date -v +1y -r $(stat -f %m  \"${f}\") +2014%m%d%H%M.%S) \"${f}\"\ndone\n\nI now realize I could have done a more generic version:\n#!/bin/bash \n\n# find specific files\n#files=$(find . -type f -name '*.JPG')\n\n# use newline as file separator (handle spaces in filenames)\nIFS=$'\\n'\n\nfor f in $*\ndo\n # read file modification date using stat as seconds\n # adjust date backwards (1 month) using date and print in correct format \n # change file time using touch (+1y adds a year \"-1y\" subtracts a year)\n # Below line subtracts a year\n touch -t $(date -v -1y -r $(stat -f %m  \"${f}\") +%Y%m%d%H%M.%S) \"${f}\"\n # Below line adds a year\n # touch -t $(date -v +1y -r $(stat -f %m  \"${f}\") +%Y%m%d%H%M.%S) \"${f}\"\ndone\n\nTo use this file you would need to write it and \nchmod +x fn\n\nto execute:\n./fn files-to-change\n\nfn=your-file-name-that-is-your-command\nExample\n./fn *.JPG\n\nwill change the date by minus one year in the directory where you are.\n\nA: Touch can reference a file's date all by itself, no need to call date or use command substitution. Here's a bit from touch's info page:\n`-r FILE' `--reference=FILE'\n     Use the times of the reference FILE instead of the current time.\n     If this option is combined with the `--date=TIME' (`-d TIME')\n     option, the reference FILE's time is the origin for any relative\n     TIMEs given, but is otherwise ignored.  For example, `-r foo -d\n     '-5 seconds'' specifies a time stamp equal to five seconds before\n     the corresponding time stamp for `foo'.  If FILE is a symbolic\n     link, the reference timestamp is taken from the target of the\n     symlink, unless `-h' was also in effect.\n\nFor example, to add 8 hours to a file's date (filename of file quoted just in case of spaces, etc):\ntouch -r \"file\" -d '+8 hour' \"file\"\n\nUsing a loop over all files in the current dir:\nfor i in *; do touch -r \"$i\" -d '+8 hour' \"$i\"; done\n\nI've heard that using a * and letting for pick the filenames itself is safer, but using find -print0 | xargs -0 touch ...  should handle most crazy characters like newlines, spaces, quotes, backslashes in a filename. (PS. try not to use crazy characters in filenames in the first place).\nFor example, to find all files in thatdir whose filenames start with an s, and add one day to those file's modified timestamp, use:\nfind thatdir -name \"s*\" -print0 | xargs -0 -I '{}' touch -r '{}' -d '+1 day' '{}'\n\n\nA: Easiest way - accessed and modified will be the same:\ntouch -a -m -t 201512180130.09 fileName.ext\n\nWhere:\n-a = accessed\n-m = modified\n-t = timestamp - use [[CC]YY]MMDDhhmm[.ss] time format\n\nIf you wish to use NOW just drop the -t and the timestamp.\nTo verify they are all the same:\nstat fileName.ext\nSee: man touch\n", "Q: Is there an Ubuntu One server in South Africa?

It would be great if theres a local server(s) to handle file sync and streaming audio.\n\nA: I'm pretty sure there is no U1 server in South Africa.\nYou can look at the source code in the python-ubuntuone-client package to see that it connects to the host fs-1.one.ubuntu.com.  That may have geodns magic, but for me it resolves to 91.189.89.76 which mtr and other tools show is located in the UK.\n(It's possible the client later connects elsewhere, but I'm pretty sure not.)\n\nA: Ubuntu One is currently (AFAIK) based off Amazon's S3 storage service.

The most you can get is 2D accelerated compositing if your driver supports it (most do), unless you are willing to install other software.\nYou have to enable the compositing feature in XFCE's settings manager, and to my memory it will use hardware acceleration automatically. (You may need to do this manually but I am on unity so I cannot test it).\n\nA: In xubuntu 12.10 go to: \nSettings Manager -> Window Manager Tweaks and navigate to the last pane \"Compositor\". \nCheck the \"Enable display compositing\"\nI know, its not of direct use for a one year old question - but I got stuck in 12.10 and landed on this site. Consider this an update of TenPlus1's answer.\n\nA: AFAIK only KWin and compiz offer opengl/3d based compositing. xfwm4 (i.e. the default window manager of xfce) offers fancy stuffs such as transparency/shadows only. And as far as your drivers question goes installing necessary drivers makes your hardware ready, you still need to enable what is in offer i.e. What @TenPlus suggests in context with xfwm4 to enjoy. You can look into cairo-compmgr for some additional compositing as well which can easily run in top of xfwm4.\n\nA: It's four years old, but there was \"Xubuntu + Compiz = Pretty pretty Xubuntu\" at http://xubuntublog.wordpress.com/2007/12/09/xubuntu-compiz-pretty-pretty-xubuntu/\n", "Q: backup by compress tar each directory I’m looking for a method to scan a directory (not recursive) and tar it using the original folder name, and then delete the folder (so I will have only the folder compressed)\nAnyone has the command for that?\n\nA: I can suggest the following one-liner (supposing the current directory is the parent of the directories to backup):\nfor f in */; do tar -czf \"${f%/}.tar.gz\" \"$f\"; rm -rf \"$f\"; done\n\nTo change each folder name to lowercase, and substitute spaces with underscore:\nfor f in */; do f=\"${f// /_}\"; f=\"${f,,}\"; tar -czf \"${f%/}.tar.gz\" \"$f\" && rm -rf \"$f\"; done_\n\n", "Q: How do I add a button or context menu option for clearing recently viewed files? \nPossible Duplicate:\nDelete entire history of the dash \n\nI really miss the function from 10.04 where I easily could delete my recently viewed files by a mouse-click.

I have downloaded an ISO file recently.\nHow do I burn it to a CD or DVD or mount it?\n\nA: how-to using windows\nIt was brought to my attention that this was answered quite well here.\nI top-posted the edit since I think it's a better answer.\nI leave the original because it is my personal answer/preference.\nFirst, if you're a Windows user trying out Ubuntu for the first time - Welcome\nWindows 8\nWindows 8 natively supports burning ISOs at this time.\nWindows 7\nWindows 7 natively supports burning ISOs. There's a copyright notice logo at the bottom, so I can't repost all the prettiness on the link.\nIt is available in the right-click menu, regardless of whether you have Nero or some other third party ISO burning software installed.  Just right click the ISO and select burn disc image.  It will take a little longer, but it is a good idea to check the verify disc after burning option.\nPrevious to Windows 7\nBefore Windows 7 you needed third party software to burn ISO images.  Many of these were available in trial form for a limited time or with certain limitations.  I personally prefer MagicISO for some of the advanced options.\nTo burn an image in MagicISO:\nClick the icon \nChoose you disc drive\nClick the icon  and browse to your ISO\nFor stability purposes, select a low writing speed, or you may wind up with a shiny coaster.\nClick \"Burn it!\"\nImgBurn is also available for free, as Naveen noted.\n\nA: Just use the pendrive installer, no need to extract the image.\nWhy does the Ubuntu image seem to be a WinRAR file? WinRAR has an option to show the contents of an ISO file. When you install WinRAR it associates itself with ISO files as well, so can easily open them. To create the bootable USB drive you don't have to open the image though and therefore don't need WinRAR at all.\nJust for your satisfaction. Click on Computer -> Organise -> Folder and layout options -> Uncheck 'Hide extensions for known file types.\nNow, you'll see '.iso' written after the file name and be able to verify that the file you downloaded is actually an ISO.\nGood luck!\n\nA: I believe that right-clicking on an .iso file will give you the option to burn the disc image:\n\nIt is called Windows Disc Image Burner, and it's a default feature available in Windows 7 and the Windows 8 Consumer Preview.\nIf not just install a .iso burning tool in Windows 8.

Now the desktop should only be shown if you hold down the super (windows) key as well. The \"d\" key (and other keys with super shortcuts) should now work as expected.\nYou may need to replace Super_L with something else depending on your keyboard, check the link above for details.\n\nEdit: I stumbled back across this answer and given that I am not sure if the link will be valid for very long I copied the post in a block below so you can reference that if the link doesn't work. \n\nFirst make sure that your local session is not capturing away the\n  shortcuts from your remote session. I like using this trick:\n  faq.i3wm.org/question/1679/toggle-i3s-listening-behavior/ on my local\n  session but you can also use whatever method your vnc client provides\n  (e.g. Remmina has a keyboard icon that when pressed will send all all\n  keys directly to your remote session)\nThen at the remote server make sure that xev reports key events when\n  pressing and releasing the windows key. Run xev from a terminal, make\n  sure your mouse pointer rests on xev's window and hit the\n  windows/super key. You should see something like this:\nKeyPress event, serial 27, synthetic NO, window 0x2000001,\n    root 0x25, subw 0x0, time 378034015, (-1,97), root:(515,117),\n    state 0x0, keycode 89 (keysym 0xffeb, Super_L), same_screen YES,\n    XLookupString gives 0 bytes: \n    XmbLookupString gives 0 bytes: \n    XFilterEvent returns: False\n\nTake note of the description of the key next to its keysym: Super_L in this case.\nNext run xmodmap -pm and look at the line starting with mod4. Next to\n  mod4 it will print what ever key is bind to mod4. If everything is OK\n  you should see this line among the output:\nmod4        Super_L (0x59)\n\nBut since you're reading these lines it\n  probably displays nothing next to mod4 or it displays some other key\n  (e.g. Meta_L). To fix it run these two commands:\nxmodmap -e \"clear mod4\"  # un-bind mod4 from what ever other key\nxmodmap -e \"add Mod4 = Super_L\" # <--- again replace Super_L with whatever xev gave you\n\n\n\nA: I had the problem with d showing the desktop and other single key issues.

I didn't know that was even possible. \nWhen I cd into Music, it's empty, but there's another Music folder there, and I have no idea how to get to it. I'm not even sure my files are in there, because du -sh reports that both copies of the music folder are just 4.0k\nHowever, if my music collection were actually gone, I should have a lot more free disk space. \nAnyway, I have no idea what to do. It's not critical that I get anything back (all my important files are backed up on Dropbox, and it looks like most everything survived), but it would be nice to have my Music collection.\nAnyway, help is much appreciated. Thanks!\n\nA: I have had exactly the same thing. Twice. No idea why.\nThankfully, you can delete the duplicate files / folders. You can prove to yourself that they're all there by doing ls -a in your home directory from the command line.\nWhen you boot up, and are at the login screen, press Ctrl+Alt+F1. Login at the command prompt.\nHere's a little script in ruby that should fix the issue (you may need to do sudo apt-get install ruby first to install, then run the following file from your home directory):\n      #!/usr/bin/env ruby\n      all = `ls -a`.split(\"\\n\")\n      some = all.uniq\n      some.each { |a| idx = all.index(a); all[idx] = nil }\n      all.compact.each { |dup| `mv \"#{dup}\" \"duplicate00_#{dup}\"`}\n\n(Note: I haven't tested this. It should be reasonably safe though so long as you have no other filenames starting duplicate00. No guarantees though!) This will find all the duplicate filenames and rename the newer ones duplicate00_filename. You can then view the folders in Nautilus, move any files you wish to save, and then delete them safely. If it happens again, run the script but change the destination filename to duplicate01.. etc.\n", "Q: Single server, multiple users, each with his own virtual machine Our school system has a low budget to update our computers, so I've thought maybe I could buy only one server (a powerful one) and hookup 30 students to one server.\nOn the server should be 30 Ubuntu virtual machines, each controlled by a different keyboard and mouse + individual monitor.\nI've looked over the internet but couldn't find no simple solution, some say you can't some say you could if blablabla on Windows, but I want to run it on Ubuntu.\nCould someone point to some docs or solutions if you know,\nwe would greatly appreciate it.\n\nA: A good solution is to use LTSP (Linux Terminal Server Project), here is a quick definition from Wikipedia:\n\nLinux Terminal Server Project (LTSP) is a free and open source\n  terminal server for Linux that allows many people to simultaneously\n  use the same computer. Applications run on the server with a terminal\n  known as a thin client (also known as an X terminal) handling input\n  and output. Generally, terminals are low-powered, lack a hard disk and\n  are quieter than desktop computers because they do not have any moving\n  parts.\n\nBriefly, LTSP allows clients to use the resources of a more powerful server computer. The client computer needs a keyboard, mouse, monitor and a network card.\nYou will find many tutorials in the red, here are some to get started:\nUbuntuLTSPLTSPQuickInstall\nHow To Install LTSP – Ubuntu 11.04\n\nA: You can't physically connect 30 monitors to a single machine. Which implies the student machines need to be some stripped-down computers - i.e. diskless, booting via network from the server, low RAM etc.\nIn this case you can use standard remote login - i.e. each user has a user account (not a virtual machine) and open a remote X session when logging in.\nNetwork transparency was sort of a design goal of XWindow, which was designed exactly for this sort of situation.\n(also, as a note - 30 separate virtual machines would have quite an overhead in terms of RAM, even idle, while with separate user accounts you could get away with much less powerful server. If necessary, it still will be possible to start VirtualBox in a user account)\n\nA: I would recommend you to explore Proxmox.  Basically it is a bare metal installation that allows you to create VMs.  The reason behind is that while a user is not connected the machine it's not using resources. Machine replication, isolation and co-existance of different OS is the aim of the whole system, it is open source therefore free.\nThis will be simple and cost effective solution.\nHope it helps.\n\nA: There are some great solutions here. Here's a different take...\nIf cost is one of your primary concerns, consider using Raspberry Pi as your \"thin client.\" The Model B is $35 new. \nAside from being a fun project, a Pi network should perform admirably with LTSP. Network booting is out, so you'll need SD cards (4gb for $4.99 ea). You'll also need TVs (HDMI or RCA) or HDMI-capable monitors, as well as micro-usb cables for power.  \nBeyond cost, a major benefit is that the Pi machines can run Debian Wheezy as standalone machines. This way, if your server fails (or its simply too expensive to purchase in the first place) the students still have very capable linux machines to work with. \nAssuming your school is a not-for-profit entity, there may be opportunities to secure Pis for free. Just keep googling.\nHope this helps, or at least provides food for thought.\nMore: http://www.raspberrypi.org/faqs\n\nA: I've seen it running windows xp back in 2007-2008..I was at basic computer class.they used 1 desktop and connected 2 mouse and 2 keyboars with 2 monitors.each user would have its own hardwares..however it was connected to 1 pc together and was running xp together...I don't know how but i have used the very own pc,and both of them have the same files.i mean i used a video to play on several monitors together..\n", "Q: How do I set a new xdg-open setting? I want to use xdg-open to open irc:// links, how can I make the required parameter?\n\nA: I wanted to associate postman links with my manually installed Postman app (not the chrome extension) so that I could open postman docs from the browser like this:\n\n\nThe link I wanted to associate looks like this:\npostman://app/collections/import/39995-2b0394ab-b007-488d-9a0a...\n\nTo do the association I did the following steps:\n\n\n*\n\n*Install the app manually (download and unpack a tar.gz) in /home/andrzej.rehmann/software/postman/\n\n*Create a desktop file in /usr/share/applications/Postman.desktop\n[Desktop Entry]\nVersion=1.0\nType=Application\nName=Postman\nIcon=/home/andrzej.rehmann/software/postman/app/resources/app/assets/icon.png\nExec=\"/home/andrzej.rehmann/software/postman/Postman\" %u\nComment=Develop with pleasure!\nCategories=Development;\nTerminal=false\nStartupWMClass=Postman\n\n\n\n*Associate the postman xdg link with the application by running:\n\n\nxdg-mime default Postman.desktop x-scheme-handler/postman\n\nI've ansibled this configuration if anyone is interested: https://github.com/hoto/ansible-home-fedora/blob/fedora/roles/postman/tasks/postman_installer.yml\n\nA: I'll describe this with magnet: URI type and Transmission (i.e. case of\nbittorent), but the same method can be applied to any scheme or file type.\nAlso I checked this with Debian Jessie, and I don't actually have Ubuntu\nmachine, but I believe it should work the same (at least for xdg-open,\nnote that file managers may choose to use different logic).\n\n\n*\n\n*Find out the MIME type string.  For file MIME types, you can\n find it out with file command:\n\n$ file -i Broken_Blossoms.webm \nBroken_Blossoms.webm: video/webm; charset=binary\n$\n\n\nFor the above file, MIME type is video/webm.\nFor URI handlers, the type is x-scheme-handler/<scheme>, where\n<scheme> is the part of URI before colon, e.g. \"http\", \"mailto\"\n\"irc\" or \"magnet\".  Following are examples of valid MIME types:\nx-scheme-handler/http\nx-scheme-handler/irc\nx-scheme-handler/magnet\nx-scheme-handler/mailto\n\n\n*Find out the name of application .desktop file.\nOften it's not the same as the \"official\" name but rather lowercase\nversion of it, or a completely different name.  Installed .desktop\nfiles live under /usr/share/applications.  Since they are normal text\nfiles and contain the \"official\" name, following command can help you:\n\n$ grep \"Transmission\" -l -r /usr/share/applications\n/usr/share/applications/transmission-gtk.desktop\n$\n\n\nThe command effectively means \"list files under this directory\nthat contain word 'Transmission'\".  Some applications may\nbe installed only for user, in that case the path would be\n~/.local/share/applications.\nIn case you have \"strange\" application that may not have the file\nat all, you can always create one (and perhaps send it to the app\ndevelopers).  Easy way would be to copy an existing one, rewrite\nfields you understand and remove those you don't.  Refer to the\nspecification for details.\n\n*Make the assignment using xdg-mime command:\n\n$ xdg-mime default transmission-gtk.desktop x-scheme-handler/magnet\n$\n\n\nNote that no matter where the file actually is\n(/usr/share/applications, ~/.local/share/applications...), you always use\nonly the name, not the full path.\nNormally the command will not output anything--that's OK.  If you\nwant to verify what you just did or see what is currently assigned\nto any MIME type without opening it:\n\n$ xdg-mime query default x-scheme-handler/magnet\ntransmission-gtk.desktop\n$\n\n\nNote 1: If you want to check out other MIME types, you can look\nat /etc/mime.types.  It does not contain all types in the world; for\nexample the URI handlers,  but it could be used for \"aggressive\" form\nof handling the associations.  For example:\ngrep ^video/ | cut -d\\t -f1 | xargs xdg-mime default vlc.desktop\n\nwould associate all known video formats to VLC.\nNote 2: The .desktop files often contain list of MIME types that\nthey claim to be able to handle using MimeType field.  xdg-mime\nman page says that the .desktop file must claim the MIME type before\nthe above mentioned command will work, but for me it seems to work even\nif the field is missing.  (I mean, the association will be applied and\nthe application will launch--if it really can handle the type is a\ndifferent question).  I'm not sure what is drawback (maybe in future\nthe xdg-mime will be more restrictive).\n\nA: xdg-open basically just looks to see which desktop environment you have and then runs gnome-open, gvfs-open, xfce-open, etc. See below for desktop environment specific instructions...\nGnome\nGnome uses the gnome-open program which uses gconf to store everything. For example on my machine with Ubuntu 10.10 running gnome-open irc://blah opens up xchat because xchat includes a gconf setting patch to add an irc:// handler.\n\nThis shows how gnome does this, with a gconf settings in /desktop/gnome/url-handlers/. See xchat-2.8.8/src/common/dbus/apps_xchat_url_handler.schemas as an example.\nKDE\nFor KDE you should look at the .protocol files in /usr/share/kde4/services/, create a new one for your new protocol and put it in ~/.kde/share/kde4/services/, if it's super useful then consider adding it to the package as a fix for other users.\nKDE is using kde-open or kfmclient depending on what's available and what version of KDE you have.\nXFCE\nXFCE uses a program called exo-open, this program doesn't have any way to configure it or add uri handlers. Looking through the source code shows that is uses desktop files to specify only three types of programs. TerminalEmulator, WebBrowser and EmailClient.\nWith XFCE4 (and probably also others) it is possible to configure xdg-open to define a custom protocol handler. In some you have to create/edit the following files:\n~/.local/share/applications/protocolhandler.desktop\n~/.local/share/applications/mimeapps.list\nAn example adding a handler for the ed2k protocol is provided at stackexchange.com2.\n", "Q: How can I stop my Samsung NC150+ from thinking it's american and no longer being able to connect to wireless networks set to channel 12 and 13 So a while a go I discovered that the reason why everyone else was able to connect to the wireless except for me (whilst being able to see other networks) was that the wireless  I used to be able to connect to is on channel 13 and my computer only sees up to 11 these days.

This lets you just type ssh hostname.  To do this, edit $HOME/.ssh/config and add a section like:\nHost *.amazonaws.com\n  User ubuntu\n\n\nA: On EC2 all the Ubuntu AMI's should be connected to like so:\n$ ssh -i your-ssh-key.pem ubuntu@external.dns.name\nSo you connect as the 'ubuntu' user using the ssh key you injected into the instance at launch (not a password).  Once authenticated, you can issue password-less root commands with sudo. \n(note: your ssh key might be .priv, or .pem, or no extension, this is just an example)\nHere are also some handy resources about connecting to EC2 instances:\nLaunching an instance and choosing or creating a new SSH keypair:  http://docs.amazonwebservices.com/AWSEC2/latest/GettingStartedGuide/index.html?LaunchInstance.html\nConnecting with your ssh keypair:\nhttp://docs.amazonwebservices.com/AWSEC2/latest/GettingStartedGuide/index.html?ConnectToInstanceLinux.html\nWhat they don't mention there is that you connect to Ubuntu instances with the 'ubuntu' account and not root.\n\nA: As a further option, if you don't want to use personal ssh keys (although probably the best solution) but want to simplify the command line, add your key to ~/.ssh/ and add the following to ~/.ssh/config:\nHost ec2-xxx-xxx-xxx-xxx.xxxx.compute.amazonaws.com\n User ubuntu\n IdentityFile ~/.ssh/yourkey.pem\n\nThen you can simply use ssh ec2-xxx-xxx-xxx-xxx.xxxx.compute.amazonaws.com\nIf you have your EC2 registered to a domain then you can also use the following:\nHost yourdomain.com\n User ubuntu\n IdentityFile ~/.ssh/yourkey.pem\n\nThen you can use ssh yourdomain.com\nFinally, to simplify it without a domain, use an alias as follows:\nHost myalias\n HostName ec2-xxx-xxx-xxx-xxx.xxxx.compute.amazonaws.com\n User ubuntu\n IdentityFile ~/.ssh/yourkey.pem\n\nThen you can use ssh myalias\n\nA: For community AMIs created by Bitnami, the username is 'bitnami'.\nHere's the section in Bitnami's Quick Start Guide, for reference:\nHow to log into the BitNami Virtual Machine. \n\nA: The nologin script on the root user tells you (via ssh -i pem.pem root@<private.ip.ec2.instance>) which user you should use instead.\nIn some AMI images that is ec2-user.

But there are programs like lbzip2, pbzip2 and pigz, which use all available cores and promise to be compatible with bzip2 and gzip.\nSo what's the best way to use these programs by default, so that tar cfa file.tar.bz2 directory uses lbzip2/pbzip2 instead of bzip2? Of course I don't want to break anything.\n\nA: One fascinating option is to recompile tar to use multithreaded by default. Copied from this stackoverflow answer\nRecompiling with replacement\nIf you build tar from sources, then you can recompile with parameters\n--with-gzip=pigz\n--with-bzip2=lbzip2\n--with-lzip=plzip\n\nAfter recompiling tar with these options you can check the output of tar's help:\n$ tar --help | grep \"lbzip2\\|plzip\\|pigz\"\n  -j, --bzip2                filter the archive through lbzip2\n      --lzip                 filter the archive through plzip\n  -z, --gzip, --gunzip, --ungzip   filter the archive through pigz\n\n\nA: You can symlink bzip2, bunzip2 and bzcat to lbzip2, and gzip, gunzip, gzcat and zcat to pigz:\nsudo apt-get install lbzip2 pigz\ncd /usr/local/bin\nln -s /usr/bin/lbzip2 bzip2\nln -s /usr/bin/lbzip2 bunzip2\nln -s /usr/bin/lbzip2 bzcat\nln -s /usr/bin/pigz gzip\nln -s /usr/bin/pigz gunzip\nln -s /usr/bin/pigz gzcat\nln -s /usr/bin/pigz zcat\n\nI chose lbzip2 instead of pbzip2 because the /usr/share/doc/lbzip2/README.gz looks \"nicer\" than /usr/share/doc/pbzip2/README.gz. Also, the tar manual talks about lbzip2.\nEdit:\npigz-2.1.6, which is included in Precise Pangolin, refuses to decompress files with unknown suffixes (e.g. initramfs-*.img). This is fixed in pigz-2.2.4, which ships with Quantal. So you might want to wait until Quantal, install the Quantal package manually, or don't link gunzip/gzcat/zcat yet.\n\nA: The symlink idea is really fine.\nAnother working solution is to alias tar:\nalias tar='tar --use-compress-program=pbzip2'\n\nor respectively\nalias tar='tar --use-compress-program=pigz'\n\nIt creates another kind of default.\n\nA: The symlink answer is really incorrect.  It would replace the default gzip (or bzip2) with pigz (or pbzip2) for the entire system.  While the parallel implementations are remarkably similar to the single process versions, subtle differences in command line options could break core system processes who depend on those differences.\nThe --use-compress-program option is a much better choice.\nA second option (much like the alias) would be to set the TAR_OPTIONS environment variable supported by GNU tar:\nexport TAR_OPTIONS=\"--use-compress-program=pbzip2\"\ntar czf myfile.tar.bz2 mysubdir/\n\n\nA: Use in your ~/.bash_aliases:\nalias gzip=\"pigz\"\nalias gunzip=\"unpigz\"\n\n", "Q: Visual boy advanced emulator runs too fast I just got the visual boy advanced emulator  1.8.0 but it runs at 125% - 200% too fast, and if I throttle it to 100% the sound goes real slow.\n\nA: This has been a launchpad issue for the last few versions of this particular emulator.\nSuggestion would be to use an alternative emulator such as Mednafen (install from software center)\n\nA: There is an alternative called VBA-M which doesn't have this problem and features easy-to-use GUI.

The package name for emulator is \"retroarch\" and VBA core is either \"libretro-vba\" or \"libretro-vba-next\", depending on your Ubuntu version.\n\nNote that hunterk PPA has been deprecated. If you are using Ubuntu 14.04 or 14.10, please use the Libretro team's PPA instead.

It's about to try it. There are also several GUIs for  ffmpeg, such as the Mobile Media Converter, mentioned over here for a question similar to this: How can I maximum compress video files? \nRemember, this won't increase the quality of your video, but this can help you to preserve your current quality.\nI hope this gives you a clue on how to run your test, even if this doesn't answer your question.\nI expect downvotes to this answer, let's see how much do I harvest this time.\nGood luck!\n\nA: If the file does not play under gst-launch, then you don't have the GStreamer elements necessary to play the file installed.\nI would suggest trying to play the file under totem (which uses the GStreamer framework).  If there are any missing elements, it will pop up a window prompting you to install the packages necessary to play the file.  Once you've done that, the file should play in totem and any other GStreamer application (including a custom gst-launch invocation).\n", "Q: Will 11.10 come with keyboard short-cuts for the file and applications lenses?

This is probably what you are experiencing here.\nYou can issue the following command to inspect the current cached path for the program:\nhash -t xxx\n\nThis will be pointing to the now missing executable.  You can clear the cache for a particular name with the following command:\nhash -r xxx\n\nNote that this problem will only affect shell sessions that executed the command in the old location.  Any new shell sessions should have a clear lookup cache and find the command as expected.\n\nA: No, you don't want to do any of that.\nLet me explain why:\n/usr/bin is where the applications from the repository are installed.\n/usr/local/bin is where your compiled applications are installed by default.\nWhen you make && make install an application, you will need to override the repository application, therefore /usr/local/bin is already in your $PATH and it precedes /usr/bin hence it is executed first.\nif you type which xxx it will still yield /usr/local/bin/xxx because it is still there where you installed it.

Empathy is a GUI for some aspects of it. But Telepathy is really different from Pidgin. It is designed to be accessed by different applications at the same time, for instance. IE, a contact application would simply make a request for a phone call, and then you'd get a GUI to end the phone call, etc. The contact application would not have to worry about the kind of protocol used, etc. That's Telepathys job. \nSo you could use Pidgin instead of Empathy, but Pidgin cannot replace it because it's a completely different thing. You'd want to get a plugin to integrate it with the message indicator. I don't know if such a plugin exists, but you could always program it yourself. Both Pidgin and Indicators have good APIs and documentation. \nPidgin could potentially be used as a GUI for Telepathy though.\n\nA: Apparently this guy switched Evolution completely with Thunderbird, and then says he completely switched Empathy and Pidgin by simply:\n\n\n*\n\n*sudo apt-get install pidgin\n\n*use your package manager to remove empathy (commenters said there were problems when removing from command line, so use package manager)\n\n\nThough I'm not really sure how that would get Pidgin integrated like Empathy is by default..

After days of searching the interwebs I found that the solution is to use the package extlinux, which is a derivative of syslinux — a solution for making FAT disks bootable.  extlinux works on e2fs and derivatives, this works perfectly on any old ext2 system.\nmkdir /mnt/image\nmount -o loop cloud-image.img /mnt/image\nmkdir /mnt/image/extlinux/\nextlinux --install /mnt/image/extlinux/\necho \"DEFAULT /vmlinuz\" > /mnt/image/extlinux/extlinux.conf\necho \"APPEND root=/dev/sda init=/usr/lib/cloud-init/uncloud-init\" \\\n     \"ubuntu-pass=ubuntu ds=nocloud\" >> /mnt/image/extlinux/extlinux.conf\numount /mnt/image\n\nThis will make the image bootable, and disable built-in cloud initialization techniques and so on.\nNotes: I haven't worked out how to specify an APPEND which allows it to use the \"root=LABEL=cloudimage-rootfs\".\nThe resulting image can then boot using qemu, kvm or vmware, without additional floppies, kernels, or anything.  And from what I understand, apt-get upgrading the kernel will make that kernel active the next boot.\nedit: I forgot to mention the obvious that you need to perform this loop-back mounting on the raw disk image, and then convert the resulting file to a VDI using vboxmanage convertfromraw cloud-image.img cloud-image.vdi\n\nA: There is now an Ova formatted image that works after importing into VirtualBox, see my long search below. I still haven't figured out how to boot an image in Virt-manager, and would like to, but extlinux didnt help. It's not seeing the kernel file locations with Direct Boot.\nWhat are the different versions available as Ubuntu cloud-images?\n", "Q: Language support problems I'm running 11.04. I want the system language to be in German. When I go to Language Support and Install/Remove Languages, I check the German box and Apply Changes.\nHowever I'm told that the package is already installed and that there isn't any need for an installation. Expanding the Details shows:\nPackage [dbus.String(u'libreoffice-gnome')] is already installed\n\nHowever, German doesn't appear in the Language for menus and windows list. How should I resolve this?\nThe problem is the same when I tried Esperanto and Afrikaans.\n\nA: I've just had the same problem.\nWhile using Ubuntu 11.10 and trying to install French language, I got the error:\nPackage [dbus.String(u'thunderbird')] is already installed\n\nAs it would be too time consuming to uninstall, reinstall and reconfigure thunderbird (as adviced in some other answer), I looked around for a different fix.\nWhat I found out was that I had some pending updates in the \"Update Manager\" utility.\nAll I had to do was to launch \"Update Manager\" and click on \"Install Updates\".\nAfter that, it succeeded installing the French language pack.\nSo, my tip is: check for pending updates before trying to install a new language pack.\n\nA: Ok I resolved this. I'll answer the question just in case anyone else has a similar problem.\nI went through and did sudo apt-get remove libreoffice-gnome. Upon which I tried again and got the same error except it was with libreoffice-draw, and then librdf0. After that it let me install German.\n\nA: You need to log out and choose the language for your session. At the login prompt, select your user, then look at the bottom of the screen. You'll find a language selector there. \n", "Q: How can I move a boot partition onto a Flash drive? I have installed Ubuntu 11.04 Server onto an Acer Aspire Easystore H340-M. \nIt was a Windows Home Server. The hardware has an integral Flash Drive / USB (SCSI11) of 256 Mb.\nCould I use this as the boot partition? If so any pointers on what I should do?\n\nA: Even if it is a flash drive and not ram ( therefore, it remembers its contents when you shut down ), 250 mb is insufficient to install the system to, so no.\n", "Q: Drawing and simulating digital circuits Drawing digital circuits can become a mess very fast which makes testing those even more difficult. Doing it offline is a painful job with all those wires. So, what GUI software is recommended for building digital circuits and testing them?\n\nA: 2022 Update\nThe original Logisim is currently unmaintained, however Logisim Evolution is now the successor, and still open source and maintained at https://github.com/logisim-evolution/logisim-evolution. It has support for Linux (Deb and RPM), Mac and Windows. It is still purely digital, and easy to run.\nOld answer\nLogisim is not in the repos, but being a single java jar, should be fairly easy to get going. It is purely digital, without the discrete and analogue components. It is however quite sophisticated - I've been putting together a simulation of a single instruction CPU with it.\nInstructions for getting and running it:\n\n*\n\n*Download the .jar file from http://sourceforge.net/projects/circuit/\n\n\n*If you saved the file to ~/apps/logisim-generic-2.7.1.jar, you can run it from a terminal with:\n java -jar ~/apps/logisim-generic-2.7.1.jar\n\n\n\n*To save yourself from typing that the whole time, create the executable ~/bin/logisim containing\n #!/bin/sh\n java -jar ~/apps/logisim-generic-2.7.1.jar\n\n\n\n*Make it executable:\n chmod +x ~/bin/logisim\n\n\n\n*If ~/bin existed before, it's already in your $PATH. Otherwise, re-login to update your $PATH. From now on, you can start it by running:\n logisim\n\nIf you update logisim later, it's as easy as putting the new file in ~/apps/ and change the filename in ~/bin/logisim\nWell, now it's there in the ubuntu 14.04 repositories as well, just type :-\n   sudo apt-get install logisim \n\nto install it.\n\nA: I used a promising program called KTechLab in the past, the program is KDE 3 based and has not yet been ported to KDE 4 I used it to teach some youngsters electronics both analogue and digital concepts, it is a fine piece of software, even has PIC microcontroller simulation, sadly development seem to be very very slow and after they made an update to it I started having stability problems, I would still encourage you to try it though.\nIt is in the repositories but I do not know if the stability problems are still there as I have stopped using it. \nThe links below may be of some use:\nhttp://sourceforge.net/projects/ktechlab/\nhttp://www.linuxjournal.com/content/computer-logic-design-ktechlab\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KTechLab\n\nA: You should have had a quick look at the Software Centre, it's always where I look first if I'm trying to find something. I typed in \"circuit\" and you get a nice list of the follow: KLogic, tkgate & Qucs (the rest just seem to be for making/design PCB's and other stuff). The tkgate one was always my favourite one to use. I suggest giving that a go, along with KLogic, and see how you feel about them.\n", "Q: Create a random playlist of all music I want to listen to all my music streaming to my android phone. How do I create a random playlist with all my music (nearly 14 GB worth of tracks) and then play that one the phone? Do I have to use my Ubuntu laptop to do this and transfer over to the phone, or can the android app do this? \n\nA: From the Ubuntu One Music application you can select \"Shuffle Play\" from the home screen and it will shuffle the music in your Ubuntu One share right to your phone.\n\n\n\n*\n\n*It is a commercial service and costs $3.99 a month.\n\n\nA: If you want easy streaming from the network, have a look at MPD on your Ubuntu machine, and you can get several clients for the Android phone eg Droid MPD Client, as well as for other machines.\n", "Q: Update Manager fails to check for updates The Update Manager is giving me a problem.

Is it possible to access files in my account Ubuntu One via iPhone?\n\nA: An iPhone client is on our roadmap, so you will eventually be able to. I can't quite tell you when it will be launched, so keep an eye out on our blog for when we announce it.\n\nA: Meanwhile two Ubuntu One client apps have been released in the App Store: Ubuntu One Files and Ubuntu One Music. And most recently, there has appeared an free app called webNotes which syncs notes with Tomboy using your Ubuntu One account.\n\nA: Yes, it is possible. There is a files app, and a music streaming app. You can read more about them, and find the links to download them, here: https://one.ubuntu.com/downloads/iphone/\n\nA: I´ve asked this to the Ubuntu-One team,and get the same aswer. While the app for files is released I´m using Dropbox; you can visualize your photos, read pdf, and get a link to share the file with someone else.\n", "Q: Does installing Ubuntu affect the files in my Windows installation? I'm looking to install Ubuntu 11.04 and I've been reading through the sites instructions but I am still wondering that if i were to install it would it keep all of my original files from my windows 7 os? \nOr would I have to reinstall and re-add my old documents once installing Ubuntu?\n\nA: You can absolutely install Ubuntu 11.04 without messing at all with your Windows 7 installation or documents.  When you go through the installation process, you will be asked what you want to do.  You will be given the option of wiping out everything on the hard drive and installing Ubuntu - you don't want to do that! - but also the option of installing Ubuntu alongside Windows.  It will even ask you if you want to import your documents, music, pictures, etc., into Ubuntu, and if you choose to do so it will make those things available in Ubuntu without messing them up in Windows.\nI am fairly new to Ubuntu, having installed it only about five months ago.  I was concerned about the same thing, and found the installation extremely safe and comfortable.  I still have my Windows 7 partition (which I rarely use), and everything is still there and unmolested.  I use a dual-boot scenario (installed by Ubuntu during the installation process) and it allows me to choose which OS I want to boot into whenever I reboot, and it works exactly as advertised.\nOf course, it is always recommended that with any installation of a new or additional OS, you make a backup just to be sure.  At least in my case, however, the Ubuntu installation was safe and worked perfectly.\n\nA: Edit: Please read the stuff below, however I have found a nice picture guide for you, which will guide you through the process here: Picture Guide\nThe other 2 answers are great, always make sure you backup your important stuff before doing anything with your partitions. Even if this means just uploading to say Dropbox, Ubuntu One, or even e-mailing them to yourself.\nRemember: Any work that gets done to partions, could potentially cause problems - especially where resizing and creating new partitions are involved.\nThat being said, usually things go quite smoothly, and its not very often that things go wrong - but you'll be glad you had backups in case things do!\nIf your new to installing Linux/Ubuntu... then just follow the install disc, and make sure you don't rush things. What you want to keep an eye out for, is trying to get them to dual-boot... you don't want Ubuntu installed onto the full system. It should just detect Windows, and give you the option of how much space you can give to both Windows and Ubuntu, with a slider that you can move about to change them. You should see something like this picture:\n\nIf I recall, that's an oldish picture (10.04/10.10). However the new one still has something very similar. So keep an eye out for it, and make sure you pick according to what you want to do (in this case, installing \"side-by-side\"). Make sure you move the slider along to how much you want to give to both... I wouldn't recommend the \"advanced\" option, unless you know what your doing (you need some partitioning knowledge for that, along with how linux file things - but these will come with time, the more you use ubuntu).\nHopefully that helps you out.\nP.S. Just did a bit of digging and found this screenshot which shows you what you'll see on the 11.04 natty narwhal install disc:\n\nThe next screen should give you the sliders I mentioned earlier, or at least something to specify the sizes for each.\n\nA: As long as you take your time and don't rush decisions if you're not sure then your windows installation will be fine, though I would be inclined to do the partition work with the windows tool rather than the editors on the livecd.\nMake sure you have backups of anything you cannot afford to lose, that includes making sure you have the discs available to reinstall windows if you do happen to make a mistake and not notice until it's too late.\nBefore you start - and assuming that you've not done so yet - make sure that you have a good download to burn from - you can use md5sum to do that - you'll also need the hash to check against, instructions for that here\nhttps://help.ubuntu.com/community/UbuntuHashes\nhttps://help.ubuntu.com/community/HowToMD5SUM#MD5SUM_on_Windows\nOnce you've done that and verified the burn is good - https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Installation/CDIntegrityCheck\nI would use the livecd (or USB if you install that way) to ensure you're hardware all works as expected before you install.\nhttps://help.ubuntu.com/community/GraphicalInstall#To_Install_Ubuntu\n\nA: I advise you to backup if it's the first time you install Ubuntu. We never know if the partitioning tool won't like your computer and crash, but I DON'T advise you to use Windows tools for that, because the worst thing that happened to me when it comes to problems with files/partitions was while I was doing exactly that. I lost everything I had in my computer. Even when the lights went out in the middle of a resize process (using the tool that is included in the Ubuntu live cd), I could get my files back, but not when I used the Windows one.\nBut if everything goes right while repartitioning, you can rest assure that Ubuntu won't touch your files. :)\n", "Q: Which software (Daw´s, Audio Editors, etc.) should be installed in Ubuntu Studio to work with videogame music and sounds? I make music and sounds for video games. \nWhich software should I install on Ubuntu Studio for this purpose?\n\nA: The Linux Multi Media Studio is a must for every audio producer. \nIf you are familiar to MS Based Audio Tools, like: Fruity Loops Studio, Sony Acid, etc. You can feel happy with LMMS.\nScreenshots from the official website at: http://lmms.sourceforge.net/screenshots.php posted here for your convenience:\n\n\n\nYou can create, use, edit samples from audio files, such as wav, mp3, midi, etc.\nFor audio capturing, manipulation, editing, DSP, etc. I can suggest you the Audacity, which is more like a multi-track waveform sound editor.\nScreenshots from the official website at http://audacity.sourceforge.net/about/screenshots placed here for your convenience:\n\n\nAdditionally you may wish to give a try to the Israel Remix Team Multimedia 11.04 found at: http://www.israelremixteam.com, which features lots of useful audio/video tools which will make these tasks easy.\nA screenshot of my System using the Israel Remix Team Distro posted here for your convenience:\n\nThe left side monitor is showing the menu with Audacity and Ardour in the background, the right side monitor is showing LMMS with a new project.\nYour question seems not to be answered with a single one but this may be useful for you.\nGood luck!\n", "Q: How to downgrade user permissions on a java app after opening port 80/443 I'm a Java developer writing a web app (Jetty server). \nAre there any guides out there are how I might downgrade user permissions using Java? \nMost native Linux apps will start as root, open root-only ports like 80/443, then downgrade themselves to a non root user (through a process which I'm not familiar with).\nI'd like to be able to do the same in a Java environment.\n\nA: On ServerFault theres a similar question with a bunch of different solutions.\n", "Q: Server auto-installed Decnet during dist-upgrade When I did a dist-upgrade of my ubuntu 10.04 server, it automatically installed Decnet, and it trew up ncurses based configuration wizard.\nI have never heard of Decnet, but I followed the instructions in the wizard, and accepted for it to be installed, and it lead to the disconnection of 2 of my internet uplinks, and the hosted website stopped responding on WAN side. Then I purged Decnet, and rebooted the server, and everything went normal. \nSo why did my server install Decnet when I did dist-upgrade?\n\nA: I can confirm this issue.\nI upgraded from Natty to Oneiric. And during the upgrade I got the ncurse-based configuration wizard, which suggests to skip configuration (which I did). After the next reboot my ethernet based network was broken, too.\nI fixed my system like this:\n# apt-get remove dnet-common libdnet\n# rm /etc/init.d/decnet\n\nTo bring the ethernet up again: (without rebooting)\n# dhclient3 eth0\n\nI assume that an obscure network library which was upgraded caused this. For example libroar1 depends on libdnet. Perhaps some upgraded package started to depend on dnet-common in oneiric, when previously it was only recommended - or something like that.\n", "Q: Can I choose between GNOME Shell and Unity on login? After installing the gnome-shell package, will I have option to switch between Unity 3D and gnome-shell at the time of logging in (just like we have choice for unity 3d and 2d)? \n\nA: Install the package gnome-shell, then you get an additional session GNOME in the login screen:\n\n\n*\n\n*How do I install and use the latest version of GNOME?\n", "Q: 3D support for VirtualBox/VMwarePlayer guests? I have been using VirtualBox VMs under Ubuntu for some time now, and, with the guest additions properly installed, the VMs always had 3D support - at least enough to run Unity in Natty.\nBut, when I've upgraded to a new machine (Dell Precision E4600) it no longer works. :(\nThe old machine (Dell Latitude D630) has Intel graphics, I think, and the new has ATI graphics, so that's probably the issue. I'm not sure how to find out what model exactly.\nThe host OS, Ubuntu 11.04, does have working 3D. That is to say, I can run Unity fine, glxgears works, and FoldIt also. Somehow it just seems to be insufficient for both VirtualBox and VMWare Player.\nI did initially try to install the ATI proprietary drivers (through the Additional Drivers tool). They did permit 3D to run in the VMs, but they also caused lots of trouble with multiple monitor support, so I uninstalled them.\nHave I somehow broken the default driver when I installed the ATI drivers, or does it just not support my hardware well enough for VMs? Might the situation be improved in 11.10?\n\nA: This appears to be solved in 11.10! :)\n\nA: Confirm in your BIOS settings that you have hardware virtualization support enabled - vendors tend to turn it off by default these days. \nAlso, your CPU may be in a series that might have virtualization support but your subsection of the series might not have it. In this case, both VirtualBox and KVM emulate in software, which is not fast enough for 3D.\n", "Q: Which Installation Process Should I Choose On The Virtual Machine?

However, I only want it on my virtual machine. When I click \"Install Ubuntu\" it says \"Erase disk and install Ubuntu Warning this will delete any files on the disk.\"\nWhat disk is that message referring to? I want to install Ubuntu so its only on my virtual machine, I don't want it to mess up Windows (which is what my real machine is running) nor do I want it to mess with my files on my real machine. \nSo, what do I do to install Ubuntu solely to my virtual machine?\n\nA: This is referring to the disk that the virtual machine sees, the virtual disk, so selecting \"Install Ubuntu\" and wiping everything will stay contained within the virtual machine.\n(Remember this is why VMs are so great, as far as ubuntu is concerned the whole disk is whatever you defined in Virtualbox)\n", "Q: How can I install vcrun2008 using Winetricks?

Last night, I decided to take the plunge, and install Ubuntu as complimentary part to my dual boot system (with Windows 7). Unfortunately, the entire process has been a struggle uphill, namely with getting the bootloader configured properly.\nA short historical synopsis, for the full context of the situation:\n\n\n*\n\n*Generated and installed Ubuntu 11.04 x64 off of a USB drive setup on a Windows 7 machine. I had trouble getting the installer to even boot, until I learned I couldn't use my USB3.0 port. Switched to the USB2.0 port, continued with the install.\n\n*I have a 1TB HDD that I split in half for the purpose of dual booting: 500GB partition for Windows 7, and a 500GB for Ubuntu (excluding the boot/swap file partitions). The Ubuntu partition was installed with the ext4 filesystem, and installation completed without any apparent problems, and was prompted to reboot.\n\n*Upon rebooting, I got dumped into the old Windows boot loader, which immediately fired up Windows. I played around with a utility called EasyBCD to attempt to add a Linux entry to my newly installed partition, to no avail.\n\n*Then, I booted Ubuntu straight off the USB drive, and installed GRUB2 onto the boot partition following the steps outlined here. I also ran the step (\"update-grub\") to generate a new 'grub.cfg' file, which added an entry to my old 'Windows 7' bootloader, but not one for my new Ubuntu partition! When I rebooted, the GRUB2 bootloader started successfully, but my Ubuntu was still unable to be found/booted under the list of available operating systems.\nAnyone have any ideas how I should change/update this configuration such that it'll point to my new Ubuntu installation properly?\nSome useful information...\n\"fdisk -l\":\nDisk /dev/sdd: 1000.2 GB, 1000204886016 bytes\n\n255 heads, 63 sectors/track, 121601 cylinders\nUnits = cylinders of 16065 * 512 = 8225280 bytes\nSector size (logical/physical): 512 bytes / 512 bytes\nI/O size (minimum/optimal): 512 bytes / 512 bytes\nDisk identifier: 0xb209a592\n\n  Device Boot      Start         End      Blocks   Id  System\n\n  /dev/sdd1   *           1          13      102400    7  HPFS/NTFS\n\n  Partition 1 does not end on cylinder boundary.\n\n  /dev/sdd2              13       60555   486297600    7  HPFS/NTFS\n\n  /dev/sdd3           60555      120143   478642176   83  Linux\n\n  /dev/sdd4          120143      121602    11717633    5  Extended\n\n  /dev/sdd5          120143      121602    11717632   82  Linux swap / Solaris\n\n\"grub.cfg\" entries:\n### BEGIN /etc/grub.d/30_os-prober ### menuentry \"Windows 7 (loader) (on /dev/sdd1)\" --class windows --class os {   insmod part_msdos   insmod ntfs     set root='(/dev/sdd,msdos1)'    search --no-floppy\n--fs-uuid --set=root 08BAB5B0BAB59B20   chainloader +1 }\n### END /etc/grub.d/30_os-prober ###\n\n### BEGIN /etc/grub.d/40_custom ###\n  # This file provides an easy way to add custom menu entries.

What are my options to set up a VNC server on Windows for best remote desktop experience from Ubuntu?\n\nA: There are many different types of VNC available for Windows. Your best bet is to look for ones that work on all O/S's and use that one. The two I can think of off the top of my head are TightVNC and RealVNC. Give those a try and see what happens.\nRealVNC: http://www.realvnc.com/products/download.html\nTightVNC: http://www.tightvnc.com/\nPersonally I preferred using UltraVNC (back when Windows was my default system), however I had issues with it a few years back when I was slowly starting to make Ubuntu my default system... It didn't like me trying to access it from Ubuntu back then. Not sure if this is still the case, but you could give that a go too.\n\nA: I am reviewing this as part of askubuntu clean up. I would add another option, FreeNX.\nFreeNX is the (Linux) open source server/client for the NX server\nhttp://nomachine.com/\nInstall the NX server on windows, use the FreeNX client on Ubuntu. \nFreeNX has the advantages of\n\n\n*\n\n*Much better performance.\n\n*Increased security (NX connections are encrypted).\n", "Q: Automatically mark files and directories tracked by git in nautilus When you use git for a lot of projects it can sometimes be hard to remember which projects you use git for and which you don't.

Before you shoot this down, please let me explain what I mean....\nI am running Windows, I also have a virtual machine installed that is running Ubuntu. I want to set up a website on Ubuntu (the virtual machine) that is either only accessible to my Windows physical machine or only accessible to other computers on my private network/LAN. So, how would I set this up? How do I host a \"private\" website on Ubuntu?\nThis video sort of demonstrates what I'm after, when he does the slowloris demonstration, he's running the webserver on windows and then attacking through Linux virtual machine. How do I do that, except reversed? http://vimeo.com/7618090\n\nA: The procedure is basically as follows: you need to create a \"virtual\" network adapter on your host machine, with its own IP address (yes, it is possible for a physical network card to have multiple IP addresses) and then set up VirtualBox guest so it binds to that adapter. This way the guest gets its own IP address which is visible in your local network just as if it was a physical machine. \nThis is called \"bridged networking\", and after you set up your host system, setting up the guest is just a matter of going to the guest's Settings - Network and selecting \"bridged adapter\" from the Attached to: dropdown.\nNow, I never did this with a Windows host, but here appear to be some instructions here. Also, now when you know the \"magic word\" - google is full of information.\n", "Q: timeout errors in apt-get update/install I'm trying to do an apt-get update or apt-get install xyz and I'm seeing timeouts like this:\nW: Failed to fetch http://eu-west-1.ec2.archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/dists/oneiric-updates/Release.gpg  \nUnable to connect to eu-west-1.ec2.archive.ubuntu.com:http: [IP: 10.224.87.159 80]\n\nIs this a transient issue with Ubuntu, or maybe it's something on my end. The box I'm accessing it from is in EC2-EU.\nPerhaps there is a way to force the installer to use the US servers which seem to work?\n\nA: Firstly, I assume the timeouts are a transient problem with Ubuntu update servers in that region.\nIt should be noted that EC2 Ubuntu AMIs point to update servers hosted on the EC2 region you are using.  It's fast (~10Mbps) and you don't pay for the bandwidth.\nHaving said that, there's nothing enforced about where you get your updates from.  You can change your /etc/apt/sources.list to point to different update servers in a different region.  Two suggestions for a workaround:\n\n\n*\n\n*copy a sources.list from the US region over to your EU hosts.\n\n*add the following line to the top of your sources.list:\ndeb mirror://mirrors.ubuntu.com/mirrors.txt oneiric main restricted universe multiverse\nWhat's neat about the second solution is that this \"mirrors.txt\" file is dynamically generated via GeoIP and should always return a good and relatively close mirror.   It's great for us Ubuntu users who find themselves travelling frequently.\nAgain, given the special nature of the archive servers on EC2, I wouldn't normally do this on a cloud instance.  And I would only do either of these workarounds as a temporary measure.  The problem, wherever it may be, is transient and I would expect it to be fixed fairly quickly.\n\nA: I'm seeing similar behavior with a cloud-init process when I am assigning an elastic IP as part of the metadata for launching an instance.  \nThe strange thing is I'm only seeing sporadic timeouts one and off for about 30 seconds while cloud-init is running.   I'm testing this with a netcat that runs every 2 seconds as part of the cloud-init.  I'm getting nc timeouts every few times for a while, and then it stabilizes.  DNS seems to work every time and occasionally gives me a different IP (as expected).  \nI'm suspecting something to with the elastic IP assignment in the AWS infrastructure but I'm not sure.  \nThe other interesting piece is that http connections to a local repo in my AWS account work fine, and calls to security.ubuntu.com (external to AWS I believe) work fine too.

Theoretically it works great with Linux as it presents itself to the system as a USB keyboard. However, my default keyboard layout is German Neo, which is radically different from a standard English keyboard. So the passphrase ends up being completely garbage. \nIs it possible to automatically have a different keyboard layout applied to the input coming from the YubiKey (the YubiKey identifies itself as ID 1050:0010 Yubico.com Yubikey with lsusb so I suppose detection should be possible).\n\nA: You can automate this with udev, there should be sample scripts available in the internet; in the end, you will be calling setxkbmap -device $n en where n is the device ID of your secondary keyboard which will probably be a symlink around /dev/input/by-id/.\nHoping this helps.\n\nA: I used the following how-to from this post.\nJust put the mentioned xorg.conf snippet into /usr/share/X11/xorg.conf.d/60-yubikey.conf.\nThe text to add (from that article) is:\nSection \"InputClass\"\n  Identifier      \"yubikey\"\n  MatchIsKeyboard \"on\"\n  MatchVendor     \"Yubico\"\n  MatchProduct    \"Yubico Yubikey II\"\n  Driver          \"evdev\"\n  Option          \"XkbRules\" \"evdev\"\n  Option          \"XkbModel\" \"pc105\"\n  Option          \"XkbLayout\" \"us\"\n  Option          \"XkbVariant\" \"basic\"\nEndSection\n\n", "Q: A driver depends on OpenGL, what package provides it?

Where do i find the \"use_time_for_policy\" fix in ubuntu 11.10 Oneiric Ocelot?\nThis post fixed it before.\nLaptop immediately suspends when going onto battery power\nI installed dconf-tools (dconf-editor) but A - didnt find a \"search\" option like gconf-editor, and B - after looking through them one by one, couldnt even find an entry similar to use_time_for_policy.\nDid I just miss it, or is there something else i need to be doing / looking for?\n\nA: Searching dconf from command line for policy with...\ngsettings list-recursively | grep policy|more\n\nresults in 3 lines with 1 of them being...\norg.gnome.settings-daemon.plugins.power use-time-for-policy true\n\nand you can set it from command line with...\ngsettings set org.gnome.settings-daemon.plugins.power use-time-for-policy false\n\n\nA: The path has moved under dconf.  You can find this setting under:\norg > gnome > settings-daemon > plug-ins > power\nAnd you are right, there doesn't appear to be any find functionality in dconf-editor.  That's too bad.\n", "Q: How to make apt-cache, apt-get into one command? In Ubuntu 11.04 or 10.04, how can I make the apt-get, apt-cache all in one myapt so that I can simply use one only, like in Fedora?\nFor example:\nmyapt search yum   # same as apt-cache search\nmyapt remove yum   # same as apt-get remove\nmyapt install yum  # same as apt-get install\n\nAny idea how to do alias for this?\n\nA: You could create a script with the following content\n#!/bin/bash\n\ncommand=\"$1\"; shift\n\ncase $command in\n  add|depends|dotty|dump|dumpavail|gencaches|madison|pkgnames|policy|rdepends|search|show|showpkg|showsrc|stats|unmet|xvcg)\n    apt-cache \"$command\" \"$@\"\n    ;;\n  autoclean|autoremove|build-dep|check|clean|dist-upgrade|dselect-upgrade|install|purge|remove|source|update|upgrade)\n    apt-get \"$command\" \"$@\"\n    ;;\nesac\n\nSuppose you call it myapt. Then, to still having the benefit of bash completion, you need to add the following lines to ~/.bashrc:\n_myapt() {\n  _apt_get\n  tt=(\"${COMPREPLY[@]}\")\n  _apt_cache\n  COMPREPLY+=(\"${tt[@]}\")\n  return 0\n} &&\ncomplete -F _myapt $filenames myapt\n\nUnfortunately $command should precede any options, but seems that bash completion do not works for options that follow command.\n\nA: I'm not sure you can use alias for that, but you could use bash to create a script.\nNow I'm no bash scripter, so I wouldn't be able to tell you the exact code for accomplish that, but what you could do is something like (this is just pseudocode, sort of, so don't expect it to work!!!):\nvar action\nvar input\nget action, input\n  if action == search\n    then do apt-cache search input\n  if action == remove\n    then do apt-get remove input\n  if action == install\n    then do apt-get install input\n\nKeep in mind you can write the script (or even a compiled application) in what ever language you are comfortable with, such as python or ruby for example, it does not have to be bash.\nAgain, remember my example is just pseudocode.\n", "Q: Does Ubuntu 11.04 fully support TRIM? Does Ubuntu 11.04 fully support TRIM? And what happens if it doesn't, will my SSD wear out?\n\nA: Yes, but you have to enable it manually by adding the discard option to your /etc/fstab like so:\n/dev/mapper/faldara-natty /               ext4    discard,noatime,errors=remount-ro 0 1\n\nAlso the purpose of TRIM is to prevent a decrease in write throughput of the drive after much use, not to prevent it from wearing out.  I have been using a drive for over a year without TRIM and have yet to suffer any performance loss, so IMHO, it is much ado about nothing.\n", "Q: Is there a way to move the unity launcher 'show' edge on multiple monitor setup? I'm in a situation where my primary monitor is on my right and that is the screen with the Unity launcher. When I fullscreen an app, the edge that actually tiggers the launcher to reappear is on my left, on the screen that does not have the launcher.\nIs there a way to fix this without moving the unity launcher to my left?\nThis is under Ubuntu 11.04.\n\nA: Sounds like a bug!\nThe detailed multi-monitor design is being worked out now, for 12.04 LTS. You might want to take a look at the proposed design as soon as a draft is available.

The game runs perfectly fine except I can't hear any sound. What suggestions do you have?\nNote: I also had the same problem with shadowgrounds survivor and this fix No sound in shadow-grounds survivor ? (64bit) worked for me. Problem is that oil-rush doesn't have a lib32/lib directory.\n\nA: The folder you want to do that in is bin. The next build of Desura will fix libs to use your system libs over the ones packaged with the game so this issue doesnt happen.\n\nA: Installing the package libopenal1 should fix the problem.\n", "Q: enable auto-completion of apt-get for non-privileged user?

On my systems (natty and oneiric) completion for apt-get already works with or without sudo.\n\nA: From your prompt it seems that you are using zsh, is it true?\nbash-completion, as the name says, is the completion for bash, so it is not guaranteed to work for other shells, though partially compatible with bash.\n", "Q: Is there a solid howto for replacing MySQL with Maria in the LAMP stack? I've heard great feedback on a few folks migrating production machines (including from this question), and I'd like to test the transition in our dev environment. Maria is apparently in the 11.10 repos, but there has to be more to it than just apt-get install; what else needs to be done to switch it out? Do the php5-mysql libraries work out-of-the proverbial box?\nA quick google didn't turn up anything, so I was hoping someone could either point me to a good article, or lay out the steps in an answer here.\n\nA: This article/tutorial may be of some help. \nhttp://kb.askmonty.org/en/building-mariadb-on-ubuntu\nAccording to Monty, (the creator), all php mysql libraries should work without any changes.\n", "Q: Where does luakit keep my bookmarks file? I installed luakit from the repos (sudo apt-get install luakit) and it seems to work fine, remembering my bookmarks and everything. The trouble is, I can't figure out where it stores this data.

I'd like to change my snap to by default cover 2/3rds of the right side of the screen when I snap to the right, for example - as opposed to the 1/2 it's doing right now. Is there a way to adjust the default settings?\n\nA: I don't see a possibility to do this in the plugins options in the CompizConfig Settings Manager (command ccsm from the package compizconfig-settings-manager):\n\nSeems to not be possible unless you change the program code and recompile.\n\nA: Option you requested is not available yet. \nOn official Compiz Wiki the option is first in the list of ideas for further improvements:\nMake the grid size reconfigurable instead of the fixed 33%,50%,66% sizes (ie. Maybe an even better option is to retain the 2x3 grid, but allow the user to specify how big the grid blocks are.) \n", "Q: How to get back default upper right corner notifications? I recently installed Xubuntu/Xfce session using Ubuntu Software Center in order to test how Xfce would look like.\nI didn't like it, so I removed those packages and got back to the default Unity shell.

Instead of that default transparent black design now there is a grey window, like this: \n\n(This is an example from Pidgin, I don't know if it has some importance).\nEverything looks ok but those notifications. What can I do to have back the original style?\n\nA: After I did a better search I found that I was missing the notify-osd package.

I own a Belkin wireless USB adapter. It seems to be supported by the rtl8192cu driver in 11.10 betas, which is great, because in 11.04 the driver had to be compiled/installed manually. But, nobody is perfect, and I seem to have some driver-related problems with the dongle. \nIt seems that it is able to connect only after several retries (taking the dongle out and plugging it in another port), or after a reboot, or sometimes at the first boot.\nI don't know how to diagnose this wireless things from the command line, so I'll tell you what I see in Kubuntu's network manager: When it can't connect, it says \"Configuring interface\" for a loong time, and then sometimes \"Waiting for authorization\". Nothing else. \nWhat I'm asking is: \n\n\n*\n\n*What type of information (logs, traces, etc), and \n\n*How do I exactly get it (where is it, is there a special command like dmesg), \n\n\nin order to\n\n\n*\n\n*try to troubleshoot the problem myself, \n\n*Have better chances to spot a duplicate bug report.\n\n*Provide that information in a new bug report.\n\n\nI'd appreciate as much information as possible regarding this matter, because I've never done it but I've already needed it in the past.\nUPDATE\nI've finally filed a bug report on this matter. Does anybody know why might be this happening?\n\nA: I finally submitted a bug report using apport. This command can be used to automatically attach some useful information to a bug. Other logs/information that turned out to be probably relevant were dmesg, lsusb and uname outputs, grepped lsmod  to show modules related to the device, and modinfo of those modules. \nFinally, it turned out that the proprietary driver from Realtek worked fine. The driver can be downloaded from Realtek's website. It seems that Realtek has modified the driver so that it supports newer versions of the kernel. In previous versions, it was necessary to patch a couple of includes, as @chicoff pointed out in his answer to the question Installing Realtek 8188 wireless driver fails, and in this comment on a similar Launchpad bug report \nRealtek's package provides a sh installer that compiles and installs the module into the kernel. It's necessary to blacklist the driver included in the kernel, so that it's not eligible for loading when rebooting. See this question for details on how to achieve it: How to force a proprietary driver to load on startup?.\n", "Q: Top left window corner pixel without clickable function From 11.04 getting used to quickly push the mouse into the top left corner to make the launcher appear, I have to realize that in 11.10 only the Globalmenu appears.\nWhat's the intended functionality for the top left area, please?\nThis seems quite bad to me as with many icons in the dash I have to scroll first the launcher upwards to be able to click on the dash icon.\n\nA: The expected behavior is that the whole left edge should reveal the launcher bar. The top-left corner should not extend the close button by design.\nHowever, bottom- and top-left corners don't do that right now, which is a known bug.\n", "Q: Upstart service never starts or stops completely I'm trying to make a simple upstart script for teamspeak server, but can't make it work.\nWhen I say initctl start  it just executes but never finishes or even  emits any message.

Did you mean 'echo' ? That may not be helpfull either, since it will go to the system console which may not be visible.\n2) Assuming the 'emit' stanza works, you say 'expect fork' but then actually fork twice. Once for the 'script', and then again when the teamspeak script forks to background itself.\n3) you \"su\" to run the script, but start-stop-daemon is actually simpler for most cases:\nWith 11.10, you don't need to do the chdir in script, not sure if that was added after whatever version of upstart you have.

Just other commands related with applications management to be present in this quicklist. (I want to have as less icons on unity bar as possible). But maybe I will really have to create separate launcher for the commands.\n\nA: This quicklist is coded into Unity, and it is not editable without changing the code of Unity itself.\n\nA: The quicklist is coded into a separate application: unity-lens-applications. It is likely populated dynamically, over dbus, by the applications lens itself. In short, there is no easy way to edit it. If you happen to know some programming and you're really set on it, you could grab the source from the project on Launchpad and make a change there.\nThat said, perhaps what you want is something that should be happening in the first place. What are you looking to change?\n", "Q: Where do I find packages files of apps that are installed I want to backup my application setup files.(source packages) \nSo can anybody please help me find the location where these setup files are stored in Ubuntu Natty Narwhal.\n\nA: From the comment to @DannyStaple I understand you look for different information.\nIf you want to know where apt-get download the (unpacked) packages you install, have a look in\n/var/cache/apt/archives\n\nThis directory could become very big, so feel free to remove the content by hand, or preferably by issuing the command\nsudo apt-get clean\n\nMoreover, if you want to know were are the files unpacked from the package you installed, the following command give you the list\ndpkg -L package-name\n\nIn particular, appending | grep /bin/ will show only the real program(s), and | grep /man/ or | grep /doc/ will show the manual pages or the documentation files.\nAs a last note, there is no need to backup installed packages, they could be simply reinstalled from repos. \nIf you do some modification to system configuration files (those residing in /etc), backup only them. User configuration files reside in hidden files and directories in your home, so a home backup is enough.\n\nA: Most apps will store personal settings in what are known \"dotfiles\". These are in your home directory, normally under \".appname\" - that is the app name, preceeded by a dot. Sometimes this will be the name of a particular library the app uses instead. Some apps store them under gnome or kde configuration directories that are also dotfiles in your home directory.\nThe safest thing here is to back up your home directory, and if you know there are large files you don't want, such as media files, then you can exclude them.\nServer apps (like apache, mysql, sshd) are quite different - but I will assume for now that you mean user apps.\n\nA: You can use an application called APTOnCD to create a backup of all the applications you have installed. It's in the Ubuntu repos and you should be able to find it in the Ubuntu Software Center.\n\n", "Q: Is it possible to install Ubuntu on a Mainboard Asus P8H67-M with UEFI BIOS?

To properly install 12.1, type the following in terminal:\nsudo apt-get install build-essential cdbs fakeroot dh-make debhelper debconf libstdc++6 dkms libqtgui4 wget execstack libelfg0 dh-modaliases\nsudo apt-get install ia32-libs\ncd ~/; mkdir catalyst12.1; cd catalyst12.1/\nwget http://www2.ati.com/drivers/linux/amd-driver-installer-12-1-x86.x86_64.run\nsh ./amd-driver-installer-12-1-x86.x86_64.run --buildpkg Ubuntu/oneiric\nsudo dpkg -i fglrx*.deb\nsudo aticonfig --initial -f\n\nThen restart.\n", "Q: Why isn't my upstart service starting on system boot? Following on from this question, I have written a simple upstart service (/etc/init/pms.conf) for my headless Ubuntu Server 11.04 box as follows:\nstart on filesystem and net-device-up IFACE=eth0\nstop on runlevel [016]\nrespawn\n\nexec /home/administrator/pms-current/PMS.sh\n\nI can start (or stop) this service at will from the command line:\nservice pms start\n\nAnd I can see that it is indeed running.\nHowever, when I first boot my machine the service does not start. If I SSH into the box and check the service status I get:\n$ service pms status\npms stop/waiting\n\nMy question is why is this happening? Why isn't my service starting on boot?\nUPDATE 1: unsure whether my service was being started and subsequently dying or just wasn't being start at all, I added the following to PMS.sh:\necho \"STARTED\" > $STARTLOG\n\nThis obviously just gives me something to look for. I tested this by starting the service myself and then checking start.log. I then deleted the start.log and rebooted. It wasn't there after the restart, so it seems as though upstart definitely isn't starting my service. I suppose it could be dying at an earlier point in the process, but that seems rather unlikely given the simplicity of it all.\nUPDATE 2: I've just upgraded to 11.10 which includes an upstart upgrade, but this problem still occurs.\nUPDATE 3: As requested, I've booted with --debug. The output of cat /var/log/syslog | grep init is too long to place in the question, but you view it here.\nUPDATE 4: More logs, this time the upstart conf is included at the top. Run 1 and run 2.\n\nA: From examining your syslog the pms process starts with no errors but then after a short while its goal is changed from start to stop meaning it is killed. \nThis is slightly strange because you have added the repsawn clause so it should attempt to start again after it is stopped but it never does. So I'm guessing you removed the respawn clause.\nBetween the pms service starting and stopping only 2 services are started ufw and network-interface (eth0), and 1 is started udev-fallback-graphics.\nIt seems that you process pms is being started in parallel. Unfortunately the upstart documentation is a little bit hazy on the exact differences between start on ... vanilla and start on starting ... and start on started .... \nTry changing your startup stanza to \nstart on started networking\n\nor just too\nstart on net-device-up IFACE=eth0\n\nThe log output is slightly strange as the net-device-up event comes much later but pms starts before it.\nThis should ensure that your process only starts once all networking set up is finished i.e. the job has not only started but finished. \nAlso do not trust log output completely, early in the boot process logging output to any file does not always work. See the answer in Debugging Upstart\n\nA: Managed to fix similar problem by using start on runlevel instead:\nstart on runlevel [2345]\n\n\nA: I had the same problem and eventually I solved it simply with:\nstart on runlevel [2345]\nwithout any net-device-up or started networking stuff\nThis is the complete upstart script, and it works perfectly:\n# MyApp\n\ndescription     \"MyApp\"\nauthor          \"me\"\n\nstart on runlevel [2345]\nstop on runlevel [016]\n\nrespawn\n\nexec /usr/bin/myapp 2>> /var/logs/myapp.log\n\n\nA: I would recommend increasing the verbosity of the job, e.g. by using pre-start/post-start entries.\npre-start script\n  logger \"pre-start for myprog\"\nend script\n\npost-start script\n  logger \"post-start for myprog\"\nend script\n\n# and for PMS itself:\nscript\n  logger \"just before executing PMS\"\n  exec /home/administrator/pms-current/PMS.sh\nend script\n\nFurther information at http://upstart.ubuntu.com/cookbook/\nAlso have a look at http://upstart.ubuntu.com/wiki/Debugging\n\nA: What's probably happening here is that pms is starting before your network adapters come up, and probably before even the loopback adapter (lo). Assuming we're talking about PS3 Media Server, it's a networked service and it probably doesn't like starting up with no interfaces available.\nTry changing your start on criteria to:\nstart on filesystem and net-device-up IFACE!=lo\n\nMeaning, start after any \"real\" network interface is up. However, that might not be ideal, if eth0 is the next interface up, PMS starts, but you really want PMS to use wlan0, that won't do.  The service will start but it might not have been able to pick the interface you wanted it to listen on.  Assuming you know the interface you're going to stream over and it won't be changing, I would hardcode it into the job, e.g.:\nstart on filesystem and net-device-up IFACE=wlan0\n\nOn Oneiric (11.10), you can use the event static-network-up to wait for all statically configured devices.  Which is nice because it allows you to write network-dependent jobs without hardcoding an interface. [Note: by \"all statically configured devices\", I'm referring to using /etc/network/interfaces instead of NetworkManager.  It does not mean static in the sense of static IP vs. DHCP.]\n\nA: I came across chkconfig during my RHCSA/CE training:\nsudo apt-get install chkconfig\nsudo chkconfig pms on\n\nYou can check it's Oneiric man page for more details on it's capabilities.\n\nA: I've found a solution for this but I don't understand it. If I move PMS out of /home/administrator and into /bin/pms with root as the owner, it all works fine.\nIf I leave it under /home/administrator/ but make sure root is the owner of everything bar the /home/administrator/ directory itself, it still doesn't work.\nIf I set administrator as owner of everything and change the pertinent part of my script to:\nsudo su administrator -c '/home/administrator/pms-current/PMS.sh'\n\nIt still doesn't work.\nI suppose for now I'll make a /home/root/ directory and move everything there, though I'd really like to fully understand this.\n\nA: Is your home directory on NFS?  Sometimes root can't access NFS.\nFor the record, in my little test just now on 12.04:\n\n\n*\n\n*start on started networking and start on network-interface-up INTERFACE=eth0\ndon't work, but\n\n*start on started network-interface INTERFACE=eth0 does.\nThanks to http://os4.org/wiki/upstart.html for pointing out that initctl list always\nshows job networking as stopped.\n\nA: I had a similar \"no start\" problem when I have realized that my script depended on a file that was in my home, and the home was not accessible because was crypted with the standard ubuntu mechanism ( .Private).\nstart on local-filesystems event is (probably) emitted before the decryption process is ended. \n\nA: In my case, upstart service depended on the script located in vagrant synced folder.\nSolved the problem using the following line:\nstart on vagrant-mounted\n\nMore info: http://razius.com/articles/launching-services-after-vagrant-mount/\n\nA: Similar to @xuhcc, I came here to find out why my Vagrant Upstart script wasn't running.  The following is supposed to work:\n\nstart on vagrant-mounted\n\nBut doesn't in some builds due to the following bug.\nhttps://github.com/mitchellh/vagrant/issues/6074\nThe workaround listed in the report worked great for me:\n$ cat /etc/init/workaround-vagrant-bug-6074.conf \n# workaround for https://github.com/mitchellh/vagrant/issues/6074\nstart on filesystem\ntask\n\nenv MOUNTPOINT=/vagrant\n\nscript\n  until mountpoint -q $MOUNTPOINT; do sleep 1; done\n  /sbin/initctl emit --no-wait vagrant-mounted MOUNTPOINT=$MOUNTPOINT\nend script\n\nWorked great for me\n\nA: it worked for me (i need start service after iface up):\nstart on started networking and net-device-up IFACE=wlan1 \nstop on shutdown\n\nrespawn\nrespawn limit 10 10\n\n", "Q: Hard disk using LVM shows \"8% contiguous\" on startup. How serious is it? My desktop runs Ubuntu 11.04 61-bit server with LVM. I use XFCE 4 as a GUI on top of the server. Recently, I get a message on every startup which says \"/dev/sda1 was not properly unmounted. Check forced\". After the check completes, it now shows that hard disk is \"8% contiguous\". A week ago it showed 4% contiguous and now it has gone up to 8%. I get the same message irrespective of whether I shutdown from the terminal or using XFCE's shutdown button.\nHow serious is this issue? Is there any serious risk of data damage/corruption? Is it time to get a new hard disk? \n(edit: fix spelling of contigous, was \"contagious\")\n\nA: \"Contiguous\" is referring not to some kind of corruption or virus, but is actually a measure of the file fragmentation, the percentage of files that are not fragmented. This will be coming not from LVM, but probably from the filesystem on top of the logical volumes, likely to be ext4.\nA simple explanation is that when may small files are allocated, and then another larger more permanent file is allocated after. At some point later, some of the smaller files are then released, leaving gaps. You may then end up with plenty of free space, but the gaps are small. \nFiles that are then created, and larger than the gaps, may be split across a number of gaps - fragmentation, and the more this happens, the slower operations on the volume will become. This number 8% is the percentage of non-fragmented files. The number going up is a good thing - but you may be low on disk space given that it was such a low number initially.\n", "Q: Does OpenOffice 3.3.0 still have the command \"oowriter\"? My Ubuntu is 10.10 with some default version of OpenOffice. In order to install some plugin, I have uninstalled the Openoffice and installed a new version 3.3.0 by downloading it from its official website, following this instruction.\nBut in the new OpenOffice, I find that a command I used quite often before called oowriter does not exist anymore. I wonder if 3.3.0 has an equivalent command? Thanks!\n\nA: I don't have an idea if it has the same command anymore, but if it's in the Applications Menu, then you could go to System->Preferences->Main Menu. There select the application you want to know the name of and click Properties. The command to execute that application shows up there. \nThis is a screenshot where I found the command to execute LibreOffice. The procedure  is very similar to finding OpenOffice Writer's command, if you were wondering why the screenshot if it's not OpenOffice Writer.\n\n\nA: The problem is that you have installed OOo to a directory where the system does not normally search for executables. The executables for OOo are now in /opt/openoffice.org3/program or /opt/openoffice.org3/bin something similar, and you will need to either:\n\n\n*\n\n*add that directory to your $PATH,\n\n*create launcher scripts,\n\n*create symlinks into /usr/bin or /usr/local/bin or ~/bin,\n\n*or you will need to type the full path each time.\n\n\nYou could also install LibreOffice (recommended) from the PPA.\nAdd\nppa:libreoffice/ppa\n\nto your sources and then install the \"libreoffice\" package.\n", "Q: App launch \"outside\" of the unity-panel launcher I created a .desktop file for the \"exploTux\" game (see https://gna.org/projects/explotux/ ), but the launcher does not match the app window.\nTo be clear: when I click the launcher on the Unity panel, the game launches and work fine but the game window is represented by a new \"launcher\" in the panel.\nHere is a screenshot:\n.\nThe upper launcher is my .desktop, the other is the one that appears when the game is running (note that there is only one opened window and that the panel icon show 3 arrows as in \"3 open windows\"...).\nI tried to pin this new launcher but then it makes unity crashy.\nWhere do you think the problem is?\nI tested on both Natty and Oneiric.\nHere is the code of my .desktop file:\n[Desktop Entry]\nVersion=1.0\nName=exploTux\nComment=A Bomberman like in 3D\nExec=/usr/games/exploTux\nIcon=explotux\nTerminal=false\nType=Application\nCategories=Game;ActionGame;\n\nedit: I have a similar problem in Gnome-Shell:\n\n\nA: It is likely that the game's \"executable\" actually launches something else, or that the game is changing the window title/class or something of the sort, and thus confusing libamf (and by extension Unity). I don't think there is anything you can do to fix that (directly), but you can report a bug against Unity.\nBug reports of this type are usually appreciated by the developers.\n", "Q: How to find out which \"Unknown\" program is still running and preventing shutdown? I get the window below occasionally on shutdown. Is there any way to find out what the \"Unknown\" program is? Perhaps find the path of the executable?\n\n\nA: This is actually a feature, not a bug. Before this, the system would log out at the loss of unsaved work and be blind to any damage. \nNowadays, applications that perform lengthy tasks worth awaiting, register themselves via DBus with the shell; these can be video encoding, uploading and syncing Ubuntu One or DropBox tasks and so on. \nSometimes applications may crash and therefore fail to deregister their pending tasks, and they may or may not be firefox.\nYou can investigate your shutdown inhibitor with any DBus viewer like d-feet:\nOn the session bus, the org.gnome.SessionManager interface will expose the method GetInhibitors(), which returns for example ['/org/gnome/SessionManager/Inhibitor2']. The object at this path will allow you to query various things, like GetAppId() (e.g. Handbrake), GetReason() (e.g. Encoding), GetToplevelXid() (e.g. 79691816L). Especially the latest may be of use: You could issue xwininfo -id 79691816 and thus verify if the window still exists and if it does, what its real title is.\n\nA: Firefox has been suffering from a bad memory leak for a long time. And it has only gotten worse the last few releases (4, 5 & 6).\nI often get this \"Not responding\" message and by trial & error have learned that it is coming from Firefox. To see if Firefox is causing this on your computer, consider trying the follow procedure:\nwhen you get the Not Responding dialog, open System Monitor. Look for the firefox-bin executable in the Processes list and if you find it see if the Waiting Channel header says \"futex_wait_queue_me\":\n\nIf you see this entry, open a Terminal and type \"killall firefox-bin\". This commmand will terminate the process.\nNow repeat whatever you did that created the Not Responding dialog (e.g., trying to restart or shutdown the computer) and see if everything is copacetic. If everything's smooth and you don't get another Not Responding dialog, you can deduce that it was the Firefox memory leak causing it.\n\nA: Try running the grub update:\nsudo update-grub\nI had the same problem described above and this fixed it for me.\n", "Q: Firefox still starts full screen I thought that this bug should be solved in oneiric beta 2.\nBut i still have this problem with firefox, thunderbird etc.\nAny workaround?\n\nA: This is expected behavior. If you start an application and it takes up 75% or more of the screen, it will automatically be opened maximized.\nYou can change that auto-maximize value with the CompizConfig Settings Manager (command ccsm from the compizconfig-settings-manager package) in the options for the Ubuntu Unity Plugin:\n\nIf you set it to 100, Unity won't change anything, if you set it to 0, it will try to start all windows maximized.\n", "Q: How to list the simplest way of hardware specification? \nPossible Duplicate:\nList the hardware info and status in my computer \n\nI want to know the computer's hardware specifications.\nLike:\n cpu:xxx\n motherboard:xxx\n memory:xxx\n video card:xxx\n pci:xxx\n\nThank you~\n\nA: sudo lshw should be what you need\n", "Q: How do I change the default session for when using auto-logins? When autologon is active, lightdm will start the Unity 3D session, not the 2D (or any other shell that I want to auto-login to).\nIs there a way to start the shell I want automatically (autologon)?\nAnyway, if autologon is disabled, the last used session is launched, and that's fine. I just want to choose which is default with autologon.\n\nA: The list of sessions is described in the directory /usr/share/xsessions.\nSome of the more common session names are as follows:\n\n\n*\n\n*For unity-2d the session file is called ubuntu-2d.desktop\n\n*For gnome-classic the session file is called gnome-classic.desktop\n\n*For gnome-classic (no effects) aka gnome-fallback the session file is called gnome-fallback.desktop\n\n*For unity-3d the session file is called ubuntu.desktop\n\n*For Lubuntu the session file is called Lubuntu.desktop\n\n*For LXDE the session file is called LXDE.desktop\nThus, if you change the light-dm configuration file to \"ubuntu-2d\" this will default the session to Unity-2D\ni.e.\nsudo nano /etc/lightdm/lightdm.conf\n\nchange the line\nuser-session=ubuntu\n\nto\nuser-session=ubuntu-2d\n\nNote - if you don't have a lightdm.conf file then for a autologin use the following values for this file:\n[SeatDefaults]\ngreeter-session=unity-greeter\nuser-session=ubuntu-2d\nautologin-user=myusername\nautologin-user-timeout=0\n\nAnother possibility is to run:\nsudo /usr/lib/lightdm/lightdm-set-defaults -s <session-name>\n\nE.g.:\nsudo /usr/lib/lightdm/lightdm-set-defaults -s ubuntu-2d\n\nThis will also create the lightdm.conf file if it wasn't already present.\n\nA: It is strange that LightDM (Ubuntu 11.10's display manager, which provides the graphical login screen) is not remembering your selection across reboots.\nYou can manually edit the relevant configuration file, which is called .dmrc and is located in your home folder. In Nautilus (the file browser), you'll have to press Ctrl+H (or View > Show Hidden Files) to see it and other files that start with a . character. If you have this file--which you probably do--then its contents will be like:\n[Desktop]\nSession=ubuntu\n\nFor GNOME Classic you can change it to say:\n[Desktop]\nSession=gnome-classic\n\nOr for GNOME Classic (no effects) you can change it to say:\n[Desktop]\nSession=gnome-fallback\n\nIf you happened to want to use Unity 2D (session type Ubuntu 2D), you could change it to say:\n[Desktop]\nSession=ubuntu-2d\n\nIf you don't have the file at all, then you can create it with the appropriate contents.\nIf you want to set GNOME Classic or GNOME Classic (no effects) as the default session type for all users--or you'd prefer not to, but the above user-specific method doesn't work--then you can edit /etc/lightdm/lightdm.conf, changing the line that says user-session=ubuntu to instead say user-session=gnome-classic or user-session=gnome-fallback (or user-session=ubuntu-2d). A few things to keep in mind when considering doing this:\n\n\n*\n\n*It is preferable to edit the per-user configuration files in users' home folders, unless you have a reason to prefer changing the global configuration (like that not working).\n\n*Since this is a global configuration file and it contains considerably more than the simple configuration option that you are intending to edit, it is advisable to back it up before editing it, in case you make a mistake. You can do that in the Terminal by running the command sudo cp /etc/lightdm/lightdm.conf /etc/lightdm/lightdm.conf.old.\n\n*This file is owned by root, hence the sudo command above. You must also edit it as root. To open it in gedit as root, you can run gksu gedit /etc/lightdm/lightdm.conf (either in a Terminal window, or in the graphical Run Application text box, when you can get by pressing Alt+F2) or sudo -H gedit /etc/lightdm/lightdm.conf in a Terminal window.\nIt seems likely that the behavior you're experiencing is a bug, so after gathering additional information by seeing if manually editing ~/.dmrc works, you may want to report it as one. Read this carefully first, then after searching to see if a similar bug has been reported, initiate the reporting process by invoking ubuntu-bug with the PID of the running lightdm process, or, almost as good, run ubuntu-bug lightdm ...which should all make sense after you've read that guide.\nBy the way, besides Unity (session type Ubuntu), Unity 2D (session type Ubuntu 2D), and GNOME 3 Fallback (GNOME Classic and GNOME Classic (no effects)), you might also consider, as even lighter-weight options, Xfce4 (install the package xubuntu-desktop and select session type Xubuntu) and LXDE (install the package lubuntu-desktop and select session type Lubuntu).\n\n\n*\n\n*In newer versions of Ubuntu than existed when this question was originally asked, Unity 2D and GNOME 3 Fallback are not available. (In the newest versions, Unity is not available either.) But Xfce4/Xubuntu and LXDE/Lubuntu remain available.\n\n*These days, users who who have used GNOME 3 Fallback are likely to prefer the MATE desktop environment, provided by the ubuntu-mate-desktop package (see Ubuntu MATE).\n\n*Lubuntu remains more lightweight (i.e., it tends to consume the fewest resources and to work acceptably on more old hardware). But it is not as fully featured as Xubuntu or Ubuntu MATE.\n\n\nThere's also GNOME 3 with the GNOME Shell instead of Unity (install the package gnome-shell and select GNOME) and KDE 4 Plasma (install the package kubuntu-desktop and select Kubuntu), but those unlikely to be less resource-intensive than the above options.\n\nA: I edited /etc/lightdm/lightdm.conf with this content:\n[SeatDefaults]\ngreeter-session=unity-greeter\nuser-session=gnome-shell\nautologin-user=paul\n\nAnd it starts automatically to gnome-shell.\n\nA: to change the default per user, check\n\n/var/lib/AccountsService/users\n\nseems like this set's the .dmrc in the user home. \ncheers\n\nA: To change the default Session in Lightdm\nsudo /usr/lib/lightdm/lightdm-set-defaults --session gnome-shell\n\n\nA: I find that setting any of the above is overridden by the users last session stored by lightdm. You may have to remove or edit the user files at /var/cache/lightdm/dmrc to enable the global default setting. Or on an individual basis by editing the user.dmrc file that has the following contents:\n[Desktop]\nSession=ubuntu\n\n\nA: This may not work in Ubuntu but it worked for me in Fedora.  It took days to figure out and I wanted to share it:\nGo to /usr/share/xsessions and /usr/share/wayland-sessions and add prefixes with a different number and a dash to every file ending in .desktop.\nThe lowest number will be the default.  For example, I want xfce to be my default so that file is named 1-xfce.desktop\nHope this helps.\n", "Q: Has \"Auto eth0\" been renamed to \"Automatic ethernet\"? Today when I checked my network settings I saw that there in addition to the connection \"Auto eth0\" was the connection \"Automatic Ethernet\" (and I haven't added it myself nor done any changes to the network configuration). The only difference is that the latter has no assigned MAC address. Is this a sign of some new change to the network manager? Or what is it?\n\nA: The answer to this would appear to be \"yes\".\nThe default name patterns for network adapters in Network Manager have been changed. I believe that upgraded installations will keep their existing adapter names.\nCitation (idea marked as being in development March 2011) :\nhttp://brainstorm.ubuntu.com/idea/27250/\nGNOME master bug (marked as fixed) \nhttps://bugzilla.gnome.org/show_bug.cgi?id=587844\n", "Q: The LED on the touchpad on my HP Pavaillion dv6-6080 doesn't work I have a HP pavillion dv6-6080 .

They have network connection over a wifi router, which gives them local IP addresses. Both computers see each other when pinged by IP. The Ubuntu pc can ping the Windows machine by hostname, but the Windows laptop can't ping the Ubuntu PC. \nIt looks like this is a common problem with a well-known solution, as seen from this question: Access server by host name?, as well as some duplicates. However, the solution there is \"install avahi\". I have avahi running, and it does not help for me. I have no idea how to troubleshoot from here. \nFrom the Ubuntu PC:\nrumtscho@bradbury:~$ sudo service avahi-daemon restart\n[sudo] password for rumtscho: \navahi-daemon start/running, process 3019\n\nand then on the Windows laptop:\nC:\\Users\\rumtscho>ping bradbury.local \nPing-Anforderung konnte Host \"bradbury\" nicht finden. Überprüfen Sie den Namen, \nund versuchen Sie es erneut. \n\nwhich means, roughly, \"hostname not found\". \nI didn't find anything suspicious in avahi.conf. Here are the working lines of the file (everything else is commented out): \n[server]\nuse-ipv4=yes\nuse-ipv6=yes\n\n[wide-area]\nenable-wide-area=yes\n\n[rlimits]\nrlimit-core=0\nrlimit-data=4194304\nrlimit-fsize=0\nrlimit-nofile=768\nrlimit-stack=4194304\nrlimit-nproc=3\n\nI tried both pinging bradbury and bradbury.local. I also tried uncommenting the line publish-addresses=yes in the conf file. Both didn't work. \nAny ideas what I am doing wrong? How can I find it out, what are my options?\nUpdate I was told in chat that the Windows PC needs a \"multicast DNS resolver\", so I installed Bonjour. Now the error message is different: \nPing wird ausgeführt für bradbury.local [*IPv6 address edited out*] mit 32 Byt\nes Daten: \nZielhost nicht erreichbar. \nZielhost nicht erreichbar. \nZielhost nicht erreichbar. \nZielhost nicht erreichbar. \n\nPing-Statistik für *IPv6 address edited out*: \n    Pakete: Gesendet = 4, Empfangen = 0, Verloren = 4\n    <100% Verlust>,\n\n\"Zielhost nicht erreichbar\" means \"cannot reach target host\", and there is 100% packet loss. So what should I do to make the Ubuntu PC reachable\n\nA: Avahi is a zeroconf/bonjour DNS responder, which is not available per default on Windows since its an Apple invention. It may help if you install 'Bonjour for Windows' on the W 7 machine.\nIf you don't like this, the Windows laptop can resolve your linux desktop if the desktop runs samba, the nmbd daemon there will advertise the hostname and the corresponding IP-Address by means of NetBIOS over TCP/IP, which is just a checkbox somewhere in the Windows networking preferences.\nThe router may do IPV4 only, perhaps disable IPV6 on both, reboot Windows, retry.\nAlso, avahi may not pick up config changes immediately, do a restart avahi as root.\n\nA: On your Win 7 laptop open up the hosts file located in C:\\Windows\\System32\\drivers\\etc\\hosts and add the ip address and hostname of your Ubuntu machine.\nFor example:\n192.168.0.100      bradbury\n\nNot sure if you have to reboot or not but that should resolve the hostname of your ubuntu machine to the ip address\n\nA: I don't think you can solve your problem in this way. In order to solve your problem you must have a local dns server set up on one of your computers, or your wifi router. The other way is what Rapture sugested  and set your wifi router to give you the same ip's (most wifi routers know that)\n", "Q: ssh permission denied in terminal but not inNautilus I have two Ubuntu machines on the same network.

Since this is both a development and experimenting system, I made a small 15 GB partition for the purpose of trying out new distros and see what I like.  Essentially, this is an experiment partition where I can screw around and see what works and what doesn't.\nI installed the beta of 11.10 last week, but don't like it too much as it seems to shift quite a bit towards Windows/Mac GUI-centric usage, while earlier Ubuntu distros were a good split between GUI/CLI interfaces.\nMy issue is it installed a new GRUB overlay. If I reformat the partition, will the OS links in the bootloader be untouched, or do I have to re-install GRUB after the partition format? \n\nA: I assume this is all on 1 hard drive.\nYes you will need to update GRUB.\n\n\n*\n\n*Boot into 10.10\n\n*Format the 15GB partition\n\n*Update GRUB\nupdate-grub2\nNext time you boot the 11.10 GRUB option should be gone and you'll be left with 10.10 and windows.\n\nA: \ndo I have to re-install grub after partition format?\n\nUsually, No\nBut you may have to re-install grub before partition format. That is the way I prefer it. Just install grub on your primary partition using grub-setup. \nI haven't tried it with 10.10/11.10 but most other OS combinations (Fedora, Ubuntu+1, Ubuntu etc) and it works.\n\nA: If you are going to test out different distributions or like me, different versions of Ubuntu installed in other partitions then I recommend that you install in your main or working Ubuntu (10.10 in your case) Grub Customizer.\nHere is the link.\nlink to Grub customizer\nThis excellent utility will let you reorder the grub menu as well as place an image as background. It also has an option in the file menu to Install to MBR.\nWherever one of my other Ubuntus overwrites my 11.04 grub with a kernel update or as Oneiric did recently installed Grub (as happened to you) I boot into my working Ubuntu and run Grub customizer and I use the file menu Install to MBR to put my Natty Grub menu back in place.\nRegards.\n", "Q: Ubuntu One - Offline Sync Music on Android What is the easiest/best way to make files available off line (offline cache) - I am on Android 2.3 on HTC Desire.. I have an option saying save to phone but all that happens when I select songs and select this button is that the first song in my list seems to download constantly. i.e. finishes and then starts again. But no song is available off line.\n\nA: I know you use Ubuntu One service, and probably have plenty of your music already there, but I'll give you an alternative solution.\nI have the exact same setup; HTC Desire with Android 2.3. For file sync, I use an android program called \"rsync backup for Android\". With it, you can just select a remote folder on your computer to sync to your phone, through sftp (SSH).\nIn order to authenticate against your computer, you need to create and use a dropbear SSH private key, wich is very simply illustrated on the program's help.\nHope this helps.\n", "Q: Accidently un-checked the synchronise check box for a folder. Now it wont let me re-check it In the file browser  on the desktop I accidentally unchecked the synchronize check box for my pictures folder.

Ive looked on the web interface for my Ubuntu One account and the \"pictures folder\" and all subfolders have dissiappeared from the account.\nHow on earth do I get this (rather important) folder to resynchronize?\n\nA: You can do that in the Ubuntu One client under \"Cloud folders\". You select folders to be synchronized on each computer. \nThe protocol is missing some features to keep Nautilus in sync with settings. For instance, if you publish a file from another computer or from the web, Nautilus will not show the file as published on other computers.

I have 195 bad sectors that won't be moved to that reserve section on my HDD.\nSo how do I make the OS ignore them?\nI've deleted all the partitions and tried to write over them, but...\nI think I heard 'BadBlocks' fixes things like this, but I didn't know where to get it or even how to use it.\nCan somebody help?\nI don't care if it crashes completely in the near future; I just want it to work for now, so I can have a boot of Ubuntu to try out.\nI'm confuse :c\n\nI know the disk is bad. I just want the installation to keep on writing past the bad sectors. The disk is damaged and likely to fail in the near future. I just know it's functional enough to use for a month or two; but the install won't go. Maybe I should explain how the hard disk failed. My brother hit the side of the computer as hard as he could, which then fell off the desk with the hard disk running. Do I have to fix them via that process, or is there another way to get the install to keep on trucking past the bad sectors?\n\nA: You can run badblocks -sv /dev/sda to test the device, from the shell after the installer exits.  \nYou can possibly check a box saying \"scan disk for errors\" before making the filesystem, and that may help it work around the problem.\nIf it doesn't, and if you really have 195 bad blocks, you are probably better off just buying a new disk.  Even if you did get it to install, more might fail in future and then where would you be?\nDrives of decent size start at only about $40 in the US, and not that much more outside. I've been a poor student too but it's not that much.\nmke2fs, the command that is used to initialize the disk has a -cc option that checks the disk for errors and lays out the filesystem so that it won't use those blocks.  If you check the \"scan disk\" option in the graphical or text mode installer, it ought to end up using that option, and then if there is any way to get this disk working, it will work.  If that doesn't work (you should paste the exact errors) then the disk is probably unrecoverably bad.\n\nA: Get a new disk, and recover as much as you can. Here is a good tutorial.\n", "Q: How can I use Awesome WM with GNOME? I followed the all the instructions I could find--the ones on the Awesome wiki, and the ones on the Arch linux wiki, but so far none have really worked. I usually get an error while trying to log in that says \"could not load session 'Awesome.'\" Is there something Ubuntu users out there have tried with success, for getting this WM to work with a GNOME session? \n\nA: firstly welcome to awesome!\nhttp://awesome.naquadah.org/wiki/Quickly_Setting_up_Awesome_with_Gnome\nExcerpts:\n gconftool-2 --type bool --set /apps/nautilus/preferences/show_desktop False\n # Still disable the buggy Nautilus desktop thing\n gconftool-2 --type string --set /desktop/gnome/session/required_components/windowmanager awesome\n # sets awesome as wm\n\nAssuming that you are on Gnome2, the above snippet should get you rolling. It disables the desktop (the desktop you see with the icons is a special nautilus window, it disables that). The second command sets sets awesome as the window manager dislodging compiz/metacity.\nI am sure that you must be getting awesome as a session option while logging in. Basically, once you start using the awesome window manager, you'll start customizing things, and for  that bottom approach is advisable (as a fellow user, what draws you to this wm is its sense of minimalism and simplicity). What I mean is that when you'll login with awesome, you'll get bare minimum things. Start working your way up by knowing what all from gnome you require.\nFor me, they were:\n\n\n*\n\n*gnome-settings-daemon : For window decorations and stuff\n\n*nm-applet : The network manager, reqd when you use wifi. Issue here is that it doesnt get access to the gnome-keyring. For wifi, I have seen people move to wicd and it seems to be great too.\n\n*gnome-power-manager : required if you are on a portable computer to lower your brightness, etc\n\n\nYou can put them into a file and called it like \"start.sh\" and call every time you login or you can put it in .Xsession file (I did this)\nI had done that (from above, long back ) What I'd suggest you do is, run gnome-settings-daemon, nm-applet , gnome-power-manager etcetra on login.

In Natty, I really enjoyed the \"Blue Highlight\" feature as detailed in this great askubuntu question: When do things in the new Unity Panel turn blue?\nIn Oneiric I notice that the upper left corner is no longer the default launch point for the launcher. Also with the absence of the BFB there is no obvious way of alerting to application notices. \nI haven't noticed any \"Blue\" notices in Oneiric beta. I assumed the Session-Indicator would turn blue when updates are available because there is now an update link in the menu. But no joy. And the volume indicator does not turn blue when its muted and music is playing.\nIs this because it's beta? I'm hoping the \"blue\" feature hasn't been dropped. It was great!\n\nA: For the most part the \"blue\" feature is still very much present, it has just moved. Individual launcher icons will have blue arrows when they are requesting attention, and the messaging menu turns blue when it needs to alert you to something. I believe the volume icon does the same thing, but I have no tested this, and I usually don't have my sound muted, so I'm not 100% sure.\nThere is an indicator for updates that AFAIK will be included in the default install.\n", "Q: Giving a single user write permissions I want to grant a single user write permissions to a directory owned by root over command line. With chmod, it seems that I can only change the permissions for owner, group and other, not for a specific user.\n\nA: If filesystem is mounted with the acl option (default in ext4 in any modern Ubuntu - if not, add it to /etc/fstab), you can use setfacl:\nsetfacl -m u:USERNAME:r FILENAME\n\nwould give user USERNAME read access to FILENAME.\n\nA: By default in Ubuntu every user belongs to a group with the same name, i.e. hannesh:hannesh.\nYou can make the folder owned by root:hannesh, and give it permissions like 770 though I see no reason for it to be owned by root if you want the user to be able to write there - why doesn't hannesh:hannesh suit you?

I have a desktop system running Ubuntu 10.10. It has no wireless card just a wired Ethernet card. \nI have a Thinkpad T42 laptop running Ubuntu 10.10 in the same room as the desktop. It uses its  wireless connection to connect to a wireless access point in another room. The wireless access point provides internet access to the laptop.\nIs there anyway to create a wired connection between the desktop and the laptop so that the desktop can connect out to the internet through the laptop?\n\nA: I did this not that long ago for my brother when I set up Ubuntu 11.04 on his desktop and used an Ethernet cable between his machine and my Ubuntu 11.04 laptop, so his desktop could use my laptop's wireless. It was all GUI too, and required no extra packages or anything.\nUnfortunately, I can't find the original source of my solution, but this post for how to do it in Ubuntu 9.10 should work just as well, it seems familiar. Basically, you just need to go to your network connections on your laptop, open Edit Connections..., click your wired Ethernet connection, and under IPv4 settings set the Method to \"Shared to other computers\". Then click Save and reboot your machine for it to take effect.\n\nA: It would be a bit tricky but it could work.

The format of the file is\nsource/relative/to/source/root destination/relative/to/system/root\n\nSo if you want to put contrib/scripts/admintool into /usr/bin/foo-admintool You'd do:\ncontrib/scripts/admintool usr/bin/foo-admintool\n\ndh_install, which reads these, is fairly smart and will try to set permissions to the right values.\nSpecifically for init scripts, there is dh_installinit. You should probably read man dh_installinit to understand it fully, but basically if you have\ndebian/package-name.foo.init\n\nIt will be installed as /etc/init.d/foo and setup to start on installation/boot.\nSubsequently, if you write an upstart job\ndebian/package-name.foo.upstart\n\nWill be put in as /etc/init/foo.conf\nAnd a symlink will be created as /etc/init.d/foo that points to an upstart wrapper for sysv compatibility.\n", "Q: Possible to run applications from the cloud?

All search tools that I know of rely on their own databases and can't use the internal filesystem's index and journal data like Everything can.\nThat said, I think under normal circumstances \"Linux\" tools are more than sufficient. locate is able to index files on any filesystem (unlike Everything) and is very fast too. If you want to look for personal documents or launch programs, then launcher software like gnome-do or kupfer is more suitable for this task.\n\nA: Yes, we have utilities like that.

There are also file indexers like Tracker (which probably be accessible from the Files and Folders lense some time). \n\nA: in command line I use locate as described by Rinzwind (1+), if you need some GUI interface I like google desktop.\n\nA: I can't remember where I stole it but try this script:\n    #!/bin/bash\n\nt=$(mktemp)\nlocate \"$1\" | awk '{ printf \"%4d\\t\\\"%s\\\"\\n\",  NR, $0 }' > $t\n\n[[ -s $t ]] || { echo \"No results found\"; exit; }\n\nrows=$(wc -l \"$t\" | cut -d' ' -f1)\n\nif [[ $rows == 1 ]]; then \n     file=$(sed 's/^.*\\t\"\\(.*\\)\"$/\\1/' $t)\n    xdg-open \"$file\" &\nelse\n    response=$(dialog --stdout --menu 'Choose a File:' 20 70 15 --file $t)\n    if [[ -n \"$response\" ]]; then\n        file=$(sed -n \"/^\\s*$response\\t/{s/^.*\\t\\\"\\(.*\\)\\\"$/\\1/;p}\" $t)\n        if [[ -n $file ]]; then \n            echo \"You chose $file\"\n            xdg-open \"$file\" &\n        fi\n    fi\nfi\n\nCopy and paste this script in a text file...\nOnce done make it executable (sudo chmod +x) and then put it in in /usr/local/bin or ~/bin\nnow, if your script name is search you have to digit\nsearch nomefile\n:)\nAnother promising tool:\nhttp://www.lesbonscomptes.com/recoll/\n\nA: I was able to install the Windows version of Everything (1.3.4.686.x86) using PlayOnLinux 4.2.6 on Ubuntu 15.10. It functions perfectly and will index both the Ubuntu partition, NTFS partitions on the same drive and added NTFS drives.\nIt works as fast and effortlessly as on Windows 7.\n", "Q: Cannot get Spotify to run I installed Spotify successfully but it will not let me log in (error 409).\nI tried running sudo ufw default allow, but it does not help. \nAny ideas?\n\nA: You need to have a Spotify Premium account. Perhaps you have installed the Linux preview client? It only supports Premium users. If you don't have a Premium account and don't want one, then you'll need to install wine and run the Windows version. \n\nA: Yes download spotify, then go to wine and browse C:/ drive for spotify (under downloads) and right click, open with wine windows program loader\n", "Q: Cannot load Ubuntu image in VirtualPC in Windows 7 I downloaded Ubuntu 32bit and when I open it in a virtual PC, it closes automatically.\nNo choice to install in safe mode. I removed quiet and splash and added single but then it also closes automatically. \nHow can I fix it so I can use Ubuntu in a Virtual PC?\n\nA: Ubuntu runs nicely in all kinds of virtualization tools. If VirtualPC doesn't work, then you should contact Microsoft. This site supports Ubuntu, not Windows. You should probably try VirtualBox instead. \n\nA: I answered this question, at least for my purposes over here:\nUbuntu on Microsoft Virtual PC\ntl;dr - it is possible, with caveats.\n", "Q: How will upgrading my hard drive affect performance? Below is my cpu information and i run ubuntu OS with 1 GB RAM with 80GB HDD. Currently i am happy with the performance of Ubuntu 11.04. I am planning to upgrade to 500GB or 1TB HDD.

I would not expect any radical improvement, but it definitely will not become any slower. \n\nA: Yes, a faster hard-drive will likely improve boot-up a bit and the launching of applications, and any new hard-drive is probably faster than your old one.  I assume you're running out of room, too, and having more storage is always a good thing.\nYou might see some improved performance, too, since with 1 GB of RAM you are probably using the swap file a fair amount, and since your new hard drive will almost certainly be faster than your old one, you might notice a bit of improved performance there.  \nHowever, even the fastest hard-drives are far slower than RAM, so an eventual addition of more RAM will provide a much more noticeable performance boost.  I don't know if you can add more RAM, but if you can I doubt you'd regret it; even 1 MB more would make a significant difference.  But since you are happy with the present performance, adding a new hard-drive sounds like a very good idea.\n", "Q: shutdown button disappears when logging in recently installed the oneiric ocelot and its awesome,but one fine time i logged out of it and when i logged in the shutdown button disappears,when i upgraded from 11.04 to 11.10 got a error message saying that the installation failed due to broken packages and when i restarted it worked.Gave this info so that it might give u guys a picture of what happened.had and issue after this with the software center and did't install google chrome from the deb file and had to manually install it from the terminal.had to run the code: apt-get install -f\nReading package lists...

indicator crash when running apt-get or similar. It'll get fixed. In the meantime, you can press alt+f2 and run: killall unity-panel-service\nThis will restart the panel with all the indicators. If you want to track the bug, you can find it here: https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/unity/+bug/854292\n", "Q: Clean install HD problems Just got a brand new box (MSI H61M motherboard) and I'm trying to install Ubuntu 11.04 on it from a CD I just burned.\nRight off the bat, if I try to install from CD it loads directly into BusyBox with:\nUnable to find a medium containing a live file system\n\nSounds like a SATA mode problem, which by default is in IDE mode. So, if I try changing to AHCI mode, I manage to boot with the CD, but the install will not continue. When I check df I see that indeed the hard disk is not identified.\nWhat is the proper procedure for this case?\n\nA: Hmm, it turns out there was another BIOS option I missed.\nSATA mode should be set also on External SATA drives.\n\nA: I bought a ThinkPad T420 and tried to install Ubuntu, and got this error. So I went to the BIOS setup and at the \"Config\" tab, \"Serial ATA (SATA)\" option, I changed the \"SATA Controller Mode Option\" from \"Compatibility\" to \"AHCI\". Then I got Ubuntu booted up.\n(I know this is NOT the issue of the OP, but this is the only question talking about this error when installing from CD, except for one using MacBook which is pretty outside my domain :) )\n", "Q: How to stop crashing my system while using PCI-X1 capture cards? 11.04 64-bit Ubuntu.

From there apply your patch, add a new entry in the log file dch -i, then use fakeroot and dpkg to create the package dpkg-buildpackage -rfakeroot -us -uc\n\nA: It's technically possible to do what you're trying to do, but you need to be far more careful than you seem to be. It's difficult to know what you did wrong because you didn't copy-paste everything you typed. I do spot a typo (cp -R ./debian-binary debina/DEBIAN, you're obviously not reporting exactly what did ), and a mistake (cp -R doesn't preserve ownership and permissions, you would need cp -Rp or cp -a as root).\nThe best way to modify a package is to get the package source (apt-get source DesktopVideo). Modify the source, then add an entry to the package changelog, changing the version number so that your version is different from the official version number. Here's an example of the steps involved (Debian and Ubuntu work identically in this respect).\nIf you don't have the source or don't want to recompile, you could install the package, then use dpkg-divert to move the buggy file(s) out of the way and replace it by your own version. dpkg-divert tells the package manager to put a file from a given package in a different location. Here's an example of its use.\nIf you don't have the source of the package and you need to deploy a fix to several machines, you can install the package, then modify the buggy file, and build a new package with dpkg-repack. It's more of an act of desesperation than a robust way to manage packages; I recommend patching the source and deploying your home-compiled package if at all possible.\n\nA: You should be able to retrieve the package source (you only got the binary there) with apt-get -d source packagename. Then you can tinker around in it and use debuild to build it again.\n", "Q: How do I set the default icon set and wallpaper for new users? I would like to change the default icon set and wallpaper so when a new user is created they have them automatically.\n\nA: Create a new dummy user, modify its settings to your liking and cherry-pick the changes from .config and .gconf, place them into /etc/skel. Keep the directory structure intact, e.g. copy:\n/home/dummyuser/.gconf/desktop/gnome/background/%gconf.xml\nto:\n/etc/skel/.gconf/desktop/gnome/background/%gconf.xml\nNote:\n\n\n*\n\n*Install gconf-editor and try to locate the settings that interest you. The tree structure maps directly to the files involved.\n\n*Be proficient in XML-editing, e.g. a syntax-highlighting editor like geany may show you common typos (In case you want to impose only a subset of the keys in the XML-file, you need to delete the remainder correctly)\n\n*Less is better, too much branding may cause eye-fatigue ;)\n\n\nA: While I haven't tested this with more recent versions of Ubuntu, I believe that Sabayon is what you are looking for.\nIt allows you to tweak all kinds of defaults: panels, background, templates, etc. It is often paired with Pessulus for restricting access to certain features, though is probably more than you need.\nUpdate:\nIt does work in 11.10, and it has been renamed to \"User Profile Editor\".\n\nA: You could edit /usr/share/gconf/defaults/16_ubuntu-artwork and /usr/share/gconf/defaults/16_ubuntu-wallpapers for setting the default theme/icon set and wallpaper respectively. The file structure is pretty simple. For example, to change the default wallpaper you have to edit the line:\n/desktop/gnome/background/picture_filename \"/usr/share/backgrounds/warty-final-ubuntu.png\"\nto\n/desktop/gnome/background/picture_filename \"/PATH/TO/CUSTOM_WALLPAPER\"\nMake sure that the custom wallpaper can be read by everyone and be extra cautious when editing these files as you may damage your system.\n", "Q: Why doesn't /tmp use tmpfs? I have loads of RAM and I use very little. I also do record some screencasts with gtk-recordmydesktop, which by default saves to /tmp while recording. I assumed that it would mean storing to RAM as much as possible, but then I actually checked and found that /tmp isn't mounted with tmpfs. Why is that? \n\nA: There was an idea to use tmpfs while it has enough space, and write to disk when you run out of space: http://www.bigdbahead.com/?p=137\nHowever, it never really took off.\nI've managed to get it working, but the FUSE overhead defeats any benefit of using tmpfs: http://shnatsel.blogspot.com/2011/11/miniwheatfs-aka-reliable-ramdisks.html\n\nA: I think you answered your own question. A lot of programs use /tmp for storing temporary files, and they can be huge. \nFor example Brasero defaults to that directory to store a CD/DVD's image file, which can be 4.7 GB of size. It's not worth risking a serious slowdown (or a system lockup) in an out of memory situation if your RAM and swap get full.\nFor advanced users it's no problem to change some applications' defaults and mount /tmp as tmpfs. For general use it's just not worth the risk I guess.\n\nA: What about zram compression ?\nThe available space is more than 256 Mbytes, it depends on files' type.\nmodprobe zram num_devices=1 \n# max ram usage = 256 Mbytes\necho 262144 > /sys/block/zram0/disksize\nmke2fs -q -m 0 -b 4096 -O sparse_super -L zram /dev/zram0\nmount -o relatime,noexec,nosuid /dev/zram0 /tmp\n\n", "Q: Cannot locate app \nPossible Duplicate:\nremove application shortcut from Unity panel \n\nFirst  a small note: my Ubuntu installed not in English language, so I could be wrong in names of some GUI elements.\nIn Unity menu (the on that appear when you click \"Super\" or Button with symbol that shouldn't be named here), when I make a search for a program I see there an icon of old game, probably dos game, or early win game, which I some years ago tried to install on wine or maybe not (not sure about fact of appearance that game on my computer). \nThe problem is that I cannot  delete that icon.

There are a few\n  reasons for this, the main one being that we felt we were not\n  delivering a quality experience to our users. We have been aware for\n  some time about performance issues with bookmark sync and users have\n  feedback that in many cases it’s not been working properly. We would\n  like to apologise to those of you who have been affected by this.\n\n\nA: It is likely that those haven't been saved at all. The couch service have been rather unstable for some time, but there have been improvements lately. \n", "Q: Automatically run a command upon entering a certain directory?

Why is it now located in the launcher rather than the top left?\n\nA: It probably also had to do with usability testing of Unity back in November last year, in which people participating in the testing had a hard time locating the button for opening the Dash. A quote provided by one participant seems particularly relevant to the new placement:\n\n“The logo should stand out more.  It would be nice if the icon itself [was] coming at you, more of a three-dimensional thing.”\n\n\nA: There may be many reasons. One reason may be that the Ubuntu button must be close to the launcher, and that it should be possible to move the launcher to different area of the screen. On my dual monitor setup, for instance, it would be much more comfortable to have it on the right edge of the right screen, because that's more directly in front of me. \nIt might also be possible that people who read right to left might prefer to have it on the right hand side. It would be very awkward if the Ubuntu button and the launcher were on completely different places -- like on different monitors. It could not be placed on the right hand side of the panel, because that would make it too inconsistent.\nI somewhat liked having it on the panel, but  I've come to the conclusion that it is better to have it on the launcher. \n\nA: Quote from Mark Shuttleworth\n\nIn the panel, you’ll see that the top left corner is now consistently\n  used to close whatever has the focus. Maximising a window keeps the\n  window controls in the same position relative to the window – the top\n  left corner. We have time to refine the behaviour of this based on\n  user testing of the betas; for example, in one view, one should be\n  able to close successive windows from that top left corner even if\n  they are not maximised.\nIt’s taken several releases of careful iteration to get to this point.\n  Even though we had a good idea where we were headed, each step needed\n  to be taken one release at a time. Perhaps this might make a little\n  clearer the reasons for the move of window controls to the left – it\n  was the only place where we could ultimately keep them consistent all\n  the way up to a maximised window with the title bar integrated into\n  the panel. I’m confident this part will all be settled by 12.04.\nAs part of this two-step shuffle, the Dash invocation is now\n  integrated in the Launcher. While this is slightly less of a\n  Fitts-fantastic location, we consider it appropriate for a number of\n  reasons. First, it preserves the top left corner for closing windows.\n  Second, the Dash is best invoked with the Super key (sometimes\n  erroneously and anachronistically referred to as the “Windows” key,\n  for some reason ;-) ). And finally, observations during user testing\n  showed people as more inclined to try clicking on items in the\n  Launcher than on the top left icon in the panel, unless that icon was\n  something explicit like a close button for the window. Evidence based\n  design rules.\n\nParaphrasing Mark\nUser testing showed that the original location confused people ,so the dash in 11.10 was an attempt to resolve this. \nFor 12.04 - the dash button remained within the Launcher.\n", "Q: How do I set the launcher to always show in Unity 2d?

Due to a kernel bug I cannot use 2.6.38-11-generic, so I'm using 2.6.32-28-generic.\nWhen will there be a new kernel in 11.04?\n\nA: Since ubuntu does not follow the rolling release model. No new software except a security update is introduced in the repositories and therefore a new kernel will not be available. \nIf you still want to use a new kernel release you can try mainline builds.\n", "Q: I crash my system often.

Or, install the TestDrive application from the Ubuntu software repository, which claims to download an .iso and run it in a virtual machine.\n\nA: Reinstallation from the ISO is the only way to be sure.

Is it really true that Nautilus 3.x hasn't the »open parent« button any more? Today I tried the second beta of Ubuntu 11.10 and I am deeply frustrated. Since Gnome3 and this whole Unity thing it feels a bit of always having to be afraid, that a new release will remove some of the main functions you are using in all days work.\nBack to the point: Is there a chance to get it back? \n\nA: The answer given so far is that we have to use the \"bread crumbs\" but I strongly prefer the always-use-location-entry to be true. We can also use the difficult key combo of alt-uparrow, but it's easier to just highlight and delete the last folder in the location bar.\nHowever, I just discovered the best way by playing around: the Backspace key.\nAt first I thought Backspace was going to the previous folder, but then realized the next folder button wouldn't work after Backspace and eventually realized it was just what we're looking for because Backspace goes to the parent folder. Backspace is the fast way to delete the last folder listed in the location bar (as long as you don't have a cursor already in the location bar). \nIf the cursor is in the location bar, you just have to select a file to get the cursor out of the location bar and then hit Backspace to get to the parent.\n\nA: The Gnome Dev's think that the Gnome 2 interface overcomplicates matters.  That's perhaps a judgement call.\nPerhaps the new short-cut key Alt + Up Arrow is something you can use.\nNautilus 3 automatically opens all folders in a tree - so you can click on any parent - they call this \"breadcrumbs\"\n\nThere is also a little arrow to open-up sub-folders below the parent:\n\n\n", "Q: I have a Fujitsu Siemens AMILO Pro V3515 laptop.

My knowledge of Ubuntu is still fairly limited, but I know I can switch terminals with Ctrl+Alt+F*.\nI was just wondering if it's possible to load my VirtualBox (winXP in this case) in one of those, that would be super handy. I currently have it set to auto-load on the right of my 2 Workspaces, but still it sometimes messes up the host-key and stuff.\nJust wondering!\n\nA: You cannot get the VirtualBox GUI running in the virtual terminals 1 - 6, only 7 and 8. Basically, you need to start the X server on VT8 and make programs run on it.\nIf you do not need window borders and a titlebar (because you're running VirtualBox fullscreen anyway) or other fancy display manager functions like Alt + Tab, you will be fine with a simple X server. Note that this may not be compatible with user-switching or re-logging when the main X server crashed.\nStart a detached X server\nsudo X -quiet -nolisten tcp -noreset :4 vt8\n\nThis will switch you to VT8 (Ctrl + Alt + F8) which is initially black. Switch back to GDM/KDM?whatever at VT7 by pressing Ctrl + Alt + F7. To run Virtual Box in VT8, run:\nDISPLAY=:4 virtualbox &\n\nThis command first sets the environment variable DISPLAY to :4 and then runs virtualbox. You need to switch manually to VT8. Notice that you don't have a title bar nor a window border. To quit the application, use the File -> Quit option. To stop the xserver, first determine the process ID of your X server (using ps uww -C Xorg | grep :4) and then run sudo kill PIDHERE.\nThis is somehow advanced stuff, I recommend to stay using different virtual desktops (Ctrl + F<number-of-desktop> because using a second X server makes you lose sound from the main X server too. If virtualization is not a requirement, consider using wine.\n\nA: VirtualBox is an X11 application. X11 (or the \"X server\") is the software layer between all modern GUI applications and your graphics card. Typically X runs on virtual terminal 7. While it may be possible to have an X server work with two virtual terminals or to run two X servers (connecting to the same graphics card, monitor), this is not common and I wouldn't recommend it. (Switching between virtual terminals, which is often connecting with switching the mode of the graphics card, is never perfectly smooth and fast.)\nYou should learn how to configure workspaces such that they work well with your VirtualBox setup.\n", "Q: How can I get Onboard (the screen keyboard) to stop launching every time I log in?

What could be making it start like this, and how can I get it to stop? \n\nA: Looks like this bug is back in precise (tried using update manager, didn't work)\nThis is the only solution I found:\nOpen a terminal window and type the following commands:\ncd /etc/xdg/autostart\nsudo rm onboard-autostart.desktop\n\n\nA: It was a bug: launchpad\nYou can use Update Manager for fix\n\nA: Let's try two things here. Open the Terminal application and type these commands:\ngsettings set org.gnome.desktop.a11y.applications screen-keyboard-enabled false\ngsettings set apps.onboard xembed-onboard false\n\nThe first command toggles whether the screen keyboard should be visible, just to make sure it is supposed to be turned off. That is the same as the option under System Settings / Universal Access.\nThe second command makes sure OnBoard does not show when you unlock the screen. This is the same as opening OnBoard Preferences and finding that checkbox. Sometimes that option gets enabled and it doesn't change back.\n\nA: On login page of ubuntu, click human icon on the top bar then uncheck onscreen keyboard.\n\nA: I opened onboard only one time, and ever since then it showed up when I was unlocking no matter what settings were set to.\nI ended up uninstalling, I mean, I have never needed to, nor foresee a reason that I would ever need to use it.\nSo if you don't think you'll use it, I would recommend uninstalling.

I have a HP dm1z with one of those button-less click pads. I'm running Oneiric beta, and the multitouch functionality works - I'm able to two finger scroll and move windows with a 3 finger gesture.

Is there any way to convert the filesystem, apart from backing up and reformatting?  \n\nA: Actually there IS a way to do this almost directly.\nYou could easily convert NTFS to ext2 / ext3 with anyconvertfs from anyfs-tools \nThen you could convert it to ext4 using tune2fs.\n\nA: Just for the record, there is a software (actually, a mini-distro) that does exactly the procedure arrange said in enzotib's answer:\nParted Magic\nIt looks like a direct conversion from NTFS to ext4, but internally the procedures are:\n\n\n*\n\n*Shrink the NTFS partition\n\n*Create an ext4 partition in the empty space\n\n*Move data from NTFS to ext4 until ext4 is full\n\n*If NTFS is empty (all data was moved), go to step 8\n\n*Shrink NTFS\n\n*Enlarge ext4\n\n*Repeat steps 3 to 6 until done\n\n*Delete NTFS partition\n\n*Move ext4 partition to NTFS' orignal place\n\n*Trim ext4 partition to NTFS' original size\n\n\nSo the more occupied your NTFS partition is, the longer it will take. If it is less than 50%, it will convert in one pass, in a single shrink-copy-enlarge iteration.\nAlthough Parted Magic conveniently automates all of this, it is still essentially the same procedures described by arrange, so it is very risky and very time consuming. Backup-format-restore is much safer and much faster.\n\nA: Another alternative is \nhttps://github.com/cosmos72/fstransform\nWhich is also available in the repos, so installable with:\nsudo apt-get install fstransform\n\nPlease read through the documentation as it is a risky procedure. \n\nA: No, there is no way that I am aware of.\nThe only way, as you said, is to backup->format->restore.\n\nA: Old post so I hope someone finds this useful. This might take a long time.\nOpen gparted and right click the partition in question, click resize and shrink it to just a few GB above what's in there. Create an ext4 partition. \nMount both partitions and copy/move as many files as you can from the ntfs to the ext4.\nIf you move the files, you free up space on the ntfs partition.\nUnmount both (I don't think this works if mounted) and go back to gparted. Repeat step one to shrink the ntfs as far as you can, again leave a couple of GB wiggle room. Enlarge the ext4 partition. \nMount the partitions again and go back to moving files.\nRinse and repeat until all files have been successfully moved.\nIf need be, you could use a couple of GB of your SSD to free up enough space on the ntfs partition... But remember that the more free space available, the faster this will go.\nOnce you have repeated this enough times, delete the ntfs partition and enlarge the ext4 to fill the entire drive.\nThis SHOULD work with any filesystem supported by Linux, but I have only tested it with ext4/ntfs.\n\nA: Open the required partition.\nright click in the partition and select properties.\n\"Select Open in disk\"\nSelect the partition and you will see a settings button.\ngo to additional settings\nselect repair file system.\nand its done. now you can make new folder and whatever you want.\nI did this on Ubunto 20.

See the wiki if they already have yours and how to add it if they don't.\n\n*There should be no need for hand-crafted texts like wvdial.conf or 99-udev-huawei-rules.conf as outlined here, it should work out of the box.\n\n*It is most likely a bug, a missing entry or both. It even might have been fixed already, so you may have some success by trying a modemmanager / networkmanager PPA or test if it works in oneiric with a live CD.\n\n*You might even have instant success if you ask your provider for an older variant of their modem (if it came bundled with your contract, the plan is available for longer than six months and the salesperson at the shop is smart enough to keep returned modems in a drawer, you name it.)\n\n\nA: In Windows 7 for my E156G (black \"3\" Three italy 3G Internet provider) I noted that its works only attachet to an USB HUB, may be a communication issue that the HUB filters. A similar solution happenet for scanner driver over WMWare Windows XP virtualization port. \nTwo drivers are identifyed with the USB HUB and the original dialer works fine over Windows 7, but only one if I plug it directly on USB notebook port and the device are not fully recognized neither the dialer identify the hardware. The second driver does not appear. So, try to use an USB HUB between the device.\nMy USB HUB is a targus translucid blue one (Targus’ Ultra Mini USB 2.0 4-Port Hub).\n\nA: What you need to do is to make sure that when you connect, it is in the right mode. That is to say it should be recognized as the modem and not a compact disk.\nThere are a couple of ways in which you can achieve this,\none is to determine the id of the compact disk that it looks like, typically it is sr* where * can be some number.\nYou need to eject it using\nsudo eject /dev/sr1\n\nreplace 1 with your relevant identifier looking at your dmesg.\nYou can use usb-modeswitch to automatically do it for you. It is available in the ubuntu repo if I'm not mistaken.\nLink here\nEdit:\n[Dialer cdma]\nInit1 = ATZ\nInit2 = ATQ0 V1 E1 S0=0 &C1 &D2 +FCLASS=0\nBaud = 115200\nSetVolume = 0\n;       New PPPD = yes\nModem = /dev/ttyUSB0\nDial Command = ATDT\n Phone = #777\n Password = mts\n Username = internet@internet.mtsindia.in\n/etc/wvdial.conf (END)\n\nHere's my wvdial.conf, you'll need to make changes to the username and password depending upon the carrier you use and your location.\nAnd yes when the modem works it is detected both as a storage device as well as the modem.\n\nA: Your modem should work on any usb but hard drives do not on notebooks usually, because not all usb are equal (some do not supply power - or not sufficient for hard disks maybe). On my notebook I have 2 usb and 1 usb+firewire and hard drives that can't be powered on external power source work only on the usb+firewire one.

How can I mount OS X 10.7 Lion shares on my Ubuntu box (10.10, 11.4)?\nSince OS X 10.7 Lion update, network integration with Ubuntu is a nightmare. Previously we could print on OSX printers and mount OSX file shares in a snap, using SMB/CIFS.\nNow I got to print on OSX Lion printers using CUPS and IPP sharing... DONE! no samba: it works.\nWorst I cannot anymore access files on OS X Lion shares (it was OK up to Snow Leopard).\nExactly from Nautilus I can still browse the OSX server shares, mount one of them (using Nautilus and smb:// URL), I can even browse all the share's directory tree, but whenever I try to open a file (even for read-only) \nI receive the error \nImpossible to open file <<smb://<host>/<share>/<file-path>> Unexpected error: Function not implemented\n\n(this is Konqueror); \nWhen trying to mount.cifs, it reports to me \nroot@UL30AL64:/home/fmoli# mount.cifs //<host>/<myshare> /media/gw-fm -o user=<myname>,password=<mypwd>,nounix,noserverino,sec=krb5\nmount error(126): Required key not available\nRefer to the mount.cifs(8) manual page (e.g. man mount.cifs)\n\nRumours in the net tell that SAMBA4 is the recipe for Linux/Ubuntu.\nBut I tried to set-up samba4 without any luck (very lack of guides around...)\nOther ones suggest to install netatalk on Ubuntu. But netatalk is a \"server-only\" package: I need to mount OSX shares on Ubuntu, not Ubuntu shares on OSX !\n\nA: With reference to this post in Apple discussion community, you can try to mount with additional two options: nounix,sec=ntlmssp\nI've tried that, it works properly:\nmount.cifs //192.168.0.x/public /mnt/public -o user=myusername,password=mypassword,nounix,sec=ntlmssp,noperm,rw\n\n\nA: This solution is more generalized and will let you access files on OS X from Ubuntu 11.10, though now via SMB/CIFS. On OS X Lion, enable Remote Login in Sharing, add your user so that you can access it, and then on Ubuntu 11.10 it should show up in Browse Network accessible as SFTP.\n\nA: You can use /etc/fstab as well:\n//192.168.0.x/public    /mnt/public    cifs    credentials=/root/.credentialsfile,iocharset=utf8,nounix,sec=ntlmssp,noperm,rw\n\nthe /root/.credentialsfile would look like:\nusername=myusername\npassword=mypassword\n\n", "Q: Ubuntu won't boot, only displays GRUB terminal I have a problem with Ubuntu 11.04.

The thing is that I do not want to change the encoding of the file. I just want to use gedit in order to edit the file (my file's encoding is iso-8859-7) and save it using the same original encoding. Is there a way to do that? \nI know for a fact that Kate has a menu option that lets you determine the encoding of the file. Even the default text editor of Windows (!!!!!!!!!!), notepad, allows you to select the encoding. I mean, I like having an extensible default text editor and all, but there are some features that are not optional. \n\nA: I found Character Encoding option on gedit Save As.. dialog and it seems you have to add your desired encoding. I think setting up Character Encoding to automatically detected will do what you desire after you add your encoding to the roster.\n\n\n\nOr you can use geany for text editing as well which is quite nice.  \n\nA: Gnome developers often value simplicity over features, while KDE developers prefer more features even if it make the program unsuitable for 3-year-olds :)\nThere is an old ticket requesting this feature, if you have a read you'll see that Gedit has some sort of encoding auto-detection which, unfortunately, is not always perfect. Since 2009 there's a patch adding Encodings menu though it doesn't look it's going to be accepted. In fact, the 'patch' seems to be a plugin for gedit written in Python - you may see if it's possible to install it, though it may be outdated.\nSo, if you need this feature - kate is a perfectly good replacement for gedit and has many nice features apart from the ability to change document's encoding.\n", "Q: Why is my ethernet connection connecting and disconnecting repeatedly?

Does anyone know how to remedy that?\n", "Q: Gzip time to decompress? I wanted to backup my entire server, which is hosted.  So I used dd and gzip to make the file smaller.  The disk was 500GB, but with less than 5% used.  I managed to dd the whole partition into a 200 GB gzip file over the internet to my home in 8 hours.  Now I am trying to decompress the file into a partition onto a new disk.  It has already taken more than 8 hours and of course I have no way of determining progress.\n\n\n*\n\n*How long should it take to decompress in relation to compressing?\n\n*I assume the local processor is the key ingredient in determining how long it takes?  (Rather than the bandwidth of the network)\n\n*Is there a way of seeing progress?\n\n\nCan I do this a better way next time?\n\nA: Here's an article I saw with some benchmarks for gzip and some other compression algorithms: http://tukaani.org/lzma/benchmarks.html. I would assume that decompression time varies with your CPU speed. Also, if you look through the tests, it seems like decompression is almost always faster than compression.\nEdit:\nIn response to your latest question about other ways to back up your server, I found this article that talks about various backup methods: http://www.techrepublic.com/blog/10things/10-outstanding-linux-backup-utilities/895. I'm not sure what access you have to the server, but if it is a common commercial host, you might be able to ask Tech Support how you should do it.\n\nA: You don't want to (ab)use dd like that.  It will waste time copying the 95% of the disk that is not being used, and you will get a corrupt image if you have it mounted read/write at the time.  If you want to backup the system, it is best to make sure you shut down all services that could be writing to the disk, and use tar.\n\nA: The simplest way to look at the progress of a running gzip process is to simply look at the file size of the written file, potentially in combination with watch if you want real time updates. If you are dealing with partitions that is of course not easily possible.\nAn alternative to estimate the progress is to use iotop. iotop will show you the speed at which data is written to the disk by every process on the system, your gzip process will likely show up on top and give you the amount of data processed per second. Then simply multiply the MB/sec with how long the process has been running (see ps auxw START column) and you will get a rough idea how long it will take.\nAs for further backup runs: Use rsync when you want to copy data from one computer on a network to another. rsync handles compression and deltas, thus you only have to transfer the data that you don't already have, which makes it very fast for regular updates. rsync also has the --backup and --backup-dir options that can be used to create not just copies, but proper backups that keep track of deleted files. \nAnd when doing diskimages partimage is a good alternative to dd, as unlike dd partimage is file system aware and will only copy blocks actually used by the file system, not empty unused blocks, it is thus able to create much smaller disk images on mostly empty file systems. But it's not a good tool for backup over a network either, use rsync instead.\n\nA: Your hoster should have provided you with a backup plan and (most preferably) a web-interface to the backup and restore facilities. The better way would be to ask them if they let you access a copy of an automated backup.\n\nA: Generally decompressing in gzip should be faster than compressing.  I suspect the problem here is that the target disk is slower than the disk from which it was compressed: or perhaps you're reading from and writing to the same physical disk which is causing a lot of seeking.\nOther answers are correct that generally it's better to back up the files, rather than the raw device.\nTo see progress, I would install pv and then say something like this:\nzcat /tmp/myimg.gz |pv -s500G > /tmp/myimg\n\n", "Q: Why is my video RAM 256MB when it should be 2GB?

I have upgraded to natty from ubuntu 10.11 by using command do-release-upgrade some months ago. \nThe update manager asked for some updations included the package \"linux-headers-2.6.38-11\". I installed this package then.\nI used command uname -r . It says current running version is 2.6.36. \nBy the command grub-install -v I had come to know that I'm using grub legacy only , not grub 2\nThen I tried sudo update-grub and I verified that menu.lst file has an entry for for all kernels available in local disk. /boot/grub/menu.lst contains both kernels 2.6.36 & 2.6.38 and some other entries.The content of menu.lst is here\nBut on reboot the grub menu doesn't show the newer version of kernel.

Why ?\n\n*What are the things should I check before my future upgradation(to coming ubuntu 11.11) ?\n\n*How to make a kernel (in this case 2.6.38-11-generic) as default kernel ?\n\nA: According to your menu.lst, Ubuntu 11.04, kernel 2.6.38-11-generic is the first and default option.  Normally if you installed originally a release of Ubuntu prior to 9.10, it used grub legacy, and the upgrade process will leave that in place.  I also notice that your menu.lst has an option to chain load grub2, so it looks like you somehow got both grub legacy and grub2 installed, which is not allowed.  Did you manually install grub-legacy with a livecd?\nAt this point I would suggest trying to purge all traces of grub legacy and reinstall grub2:\nsudo rm -fr /boot/grub\nsudo apt-get install --reinstall grub-pc\nsudo update-grub\n\nDuring the reinstall step, you should be presented with a menu with a blue background asking you to check off which drives grub should be installed to.  Make sure your boot drive is selected.  If you don't get that screen, then you can force it by running sudo dpkg-reconfigure grub-pc.\n\nA: GRUB 2 is capable of automatic detection of various operating systems and automatic configuration, whereas GRUB 1 is not.\n", "Q: How do I stop XFCE4 from respawing programms running at logout on login?

Lately, I turned off my computer while ubuntu was shutting down. Since then Whenever i try booting ubuntu, I get a Segmentation fault error and busy box opens by default. Since I have crucial data on ubuntu disk, I want to access the ubuntu files from Windows 7. Is there any software which allows me to do so?\nNote: For ubuntu installed within windows, all the data is stored in a file root.disk. One way to read it is by using ext2explore.\n\nA: You can use Ext2Fsd to access an Ext4 (default Ubuntu partition format) partition in Windows.\nA Ext4 partition will be mounted in read-only mode by default even do you could mount it in read-and-write mode if you really need to (not recommended).\nYou can find more information on how to run and install it here.\n\nA: Windows 7 cannot read linux drives directly, however you can try running windows softwares like Ext2Fsd as mentioned above or LinuxReader by DiskInternals.\n\nA: Windows is not capable of using non-Windows file systems. If necessary, you should instead boot a live Ubuntu session, which is capable of using Windows file systems. \nBut it is likely that you'll be able to easily fix the Ubuntu installation. It will probably be as simple as renaming a file. You can easily confirm this. If you do not have a file called c:/ubuntu/disks/root.disk, then it will be easy to fix. \nWhat you should do, is to open another question, such as \"How do I fix this broken wubi install?\" and add the output from ls -laR /media/WINDOWS_FS/ubuntu. Make sure to replace WINDOWS_FS with the label of your C:\\ filesystem. \n\nA: Another useful method to fix errors like this is to use Puppy Linux. You can install it to a flash drive from Windows with Pen Drive Linux's Universal USB Installer. Then you can boot many PC's into Linux whenever you want.\n", "Q: Power cog is gone from the panel I've tried the solution from here The \"power cog\" has disappeared but that doesn't solve anything, I have indicator-session installed but the cog is gone still. Is this a know issue at this stage and will it be fixed come release day?\n\nA: Just run killall unity-panel-service and the panel will restart (bringing the cog back).\n\nA: This happened to me today actually.  You probably has just downloaded an update.  I did and after that the cog disappeared, then after a reboot, it came back.  You can follow what Roland Taylor said to kill the panel service which restarts it to fix it.\nAnd most importantly...\nKeep in mind...\nIt's a BETA release :)\n", "Q: Broken sound volume indicator - can't change volume I have Ubuntu 11.04 (Natty Narwhal) and the sound indicator in the panel sometimes breaks down. I assume it is probably because the sound system crashes or something.\nWhen this happens, The sound indicator shows just three dashes instead of the current volume, I can't change the volume using the Volume Up/Volume Down keys on my keyboard, not can I change it using the slider that shows when I click on the sound indicator.\nWhen I click on the sound indicator and then click on the \"Sound preferences\" in the popup menu, a message box appears, saying something like \"Waiting for sound system to respond\". I found that this is due to crashed pulseaudio (whatever that is) and I should type pulseaudio --start to start it again. After I do that, I can open the sound preferences and adjust the volume from there, but I still can't change the volume using the multimedia keys on my keyboard, nor using the volume slider in the sound indicator.\nSo my questions:\n\n\n*\n\n*Is there a way to stop pulseaudio from crashing (assuming this is the cause for the indicator to break down)?\n\n*If not, is there at least a way to restore the volume indicator after the pulseaudio system has been restarted, so the volume keyboard shortcuts and the slider work (maybe a way to restart the indicator itself)?\n\n\nA: PulseAudio is an audio system that, among other things, enables multiple applications to use the audio interface at the same time. It can also be used for things like sharing audio over the network. So, PulseAudio is a good thing. \n\n\n*\n\n*If PulseAudio keeps crashing, then something is wrong. The best way for you to prevent that from happening, is to file a bug on http://Launchpad.net and get the developers attention. We don't exactly have a configuration option to enable or disable application crashes. :)\n\n*Yes, restarting the indicators might be a successful workaround. In order to do that, you'll press AltF2 and type killall unity-panel-service\nIf restarting PulseAudio and then restarting the panel service works, then you might want to combine them in a script so you can do both things at once. You can then create a new text file in Gedit, paste the following and make the file executable. You do that by right clicking on the file, selecting properties > permissions > Allow execution of file. Afterwards, you can run that script as a normal program. \nThis is the script itself: \n\n#!/bin/sh\npulseaudio --start\nkillall unity-panel-service\n\nSo, if you call the file fix_audio.sh and place it in your home directory, you'll be able to run it by pressing alt+f2 and typing ~/fix_audio.sh. \nHowever, even if this workaround works, you should still file a bug on Launchpad so that the problem itself gets fixed for you and everyone else. \n\nA: A fast and efficient way to restart a hanging pulseaudio server is running the following command in a terminal:\npulseaudio -k\n\nIn a standard Ubuntu setup this will kill pulseaudio sound server and restart it automatically.\n", "Q: \"command not found\" when running \"lessc\" from bash I have installed lessc via npm, Node.js Package Manager, and when I run lessc from terminal using\nlessc /var/www/less/style.less /var/www/css/style.css\n\nit works perfectly.\nHowever, when I put this exact same command in a bash script, less.sh, it returns the error\n\nlessc : command not found.\n\nAlso, I need to run this command from a bash script, because incron, a program which I am using to re-compile my less script each time they are modified, is unable to run the command mentioned above, which I believe may be caused by weird methods for handling white-space in the command.\n\nA: Where is the \"lessc\" executable? Do:\ntype -p lessc\n\nand take note of the directory, and figure out where that directory is added to your PATH. I think that bash and incron do not source your setup files (.bashrc, etc) the same way. Reading the Bash man page, the INVOCATION section describes how bash finds its startup files. A quick grep through the incron source shows that it doesn't mention .bashrc or .bash_profile.\nYou could change the \"lessc\" command in your script to:\n/actual/path/to/lessc\n\nthat you found via\ntype -p lessc\n\n\nA: npm install -g less\n\nThat installs Less.js globally.

For instance, my bank connection to Mobile Broadband and my internet surfing and software downloads to WiFi. \n\n\n*\n\n*How does Ubuntu 11.10 or 11.04 allocate the usage of two connections to Google Chrome?\n\n*How can you manually decide which internet connection to use with Wget? Do you need any external command to do the allocation? - In my opinion, it would be much more orthogonal and efficient if you could have an external program to do the allocation. - I could then simply launch my Google Chrome to the wanted connection manually.\n\nA: This is a question of packet routing, e.g. deciding which packets (addressed to which IP addresses) go out which interface. To answer question 1, both connections' packets are routed to the same interface. Use the route command to show your current routing setup. Use the ifconfig -a command to see your interfaces and the IP addresses assigned to them.\nThere are two ways to force wget to use a particular internet connection: use the --bind-address=ADDRESS option to wget (See man wget for details); OR add a route to an IP address/netmask pointing to the interface packets for that address (those addresses) should use. Using route affects all packets to that IP. See man route. You want something like:\nsudo route add -host <*bank's IP*> dev <*MobileBroadband's interface*>\n\nYou have to do this once per reboot, or once every time your Mobile Broadband comes up.\n", "Q: Install only virsh command utility to manage KVM VMs (without GUI) I want to only install the packages that provide virsh to create and manage KVM virtual machines.

I've been using Oneiric since the second Alpha (had to, my new system refused to run any older Ubuntu version) and I've never been able to get the nifty LightDM theme I'm seeing everywhere. Instead, I'm alway seeing this theme instead:\n\nCan anyone explain to me how to change / fix this?\nAlso when I do a sudo dpkg-reconfigure lightdm, it gives the following warnings, could that be related to my problem?: \ndpkg-maintscript-helper: warning: environment variable DPKG_MAINTSCRIPT_NAME missing         \ndpkg-maintscript-helper: warning: environment variable DPKG_MAINTSCRIPT_PACKAGE missing \n\n\nA: May seem silly, but have you sudo apt-get install lightdm unity-greeter? If I recall correctly lightdm should be downloaded as a part of the ubuntu-desktop meta package - so if you've missed that package, try installing it. You should also have the unity-greeter packaged.

I am using Ubuntu 11.04 on an AMD64 computer. When I boot the computer the memory usage of unity-window-decorator is few tens of MB (checked with System Monitor)c After many hours using Google Chrome, LibreOffice, Kile, Skype etc. the memory usage for unity-window-decorator increases to almost 1 GB.

Looking through the discussions on Maemo, it seemes that this process is not easily changeable, but maybe you can start from there. \nIf you are not fixated on QT Creator, you can simply use it to create you code and then follow the Ubuntu Packaging Guide to create your debian package. \nThe actual submission to the Software Center is described here.\nFor future questions I would suggest you write in more detail what your actual problem is.\n\nA: You can do this with an additional rule in the makefile generated by qmake:\n\n\n*\n\n*Write a shell script my_package_script.sh that creates the package.\n\n*In your .pro file, add this:\nmypackagerule.target = mypackagerule\nmypackagerule.command = exec my_package_script.sh\nQMAKE_EXTRA_TARGETS += mypackagerule\n\nNow you can create your package calling make mypackagerule.

Its pretty neat but a free version would be nicer and even more if in the debian/ubuntu repos.\n\nA: There are lots of them.

I never need my user name to be shown on the desktop as I am the only one to use my computer. I'd prefer if there would be something like a shutdown icon instead of the user name to open the session menu. How to achieve this in XUbuntu 11.10?\n\nA: You can remove the session menu and add an item called 'Action Button' instead. Per default, it will display the usual xfce log-out menu (same as the main menu item).\nIf this is too pristine, you can add a custom launcher and add the various commands supported by xfce4-session-logout: (excerpt from xfce4-session-logout --help)\n\n  -l, --logout             Log out without displaying the logout dialog\n  -h, --halt               Halt without displaying the logout dialog\n  -r, --reboot             Reboot without displaying the logout dialog\n  -s, --suspend            Suspend without displaying the logout dialog\n  --hibernate              Hibernate without displaying the logout dialog\n  -f, --fast               Log out quickly; don't save the session\n\n\nN.b.: This is from xubuntu 11.04, should still work in 11.10.\n\nA: Since Xubuntu 14.04, the Session Menu has been removed from panel by default and replaced by a log out button in the Whisker Menu.\nThe session menu can be easily restored by adding \"Action Buttons\" to the panel; however, that doesn't have any option to hide just the user name. Hence the alternative menu.\nSetup alternative menu\nFrom step 3 onwards, the \"Launcher\" window shall remain open.\n\n\n*\n\n*Right-click on panel, then select Panel > Add New Items...\n\n*In \"Add New Items\" window, select and click Launcher - Add.

Another difference is, Launcher will always allow \"Switch User\" menu regardless of single or multiuser host system. This action doesn't switch directly to other user but returns to login screen (Same behaviour as \"Switch Users\" in Whisker Menu).\nSetup caveats\nAbove steps are not perfect. There are trivial issues when using launchers, but these can be improved by workarounds.\n\nSession Menu using Launcher appears ugly, with uneven spacing and icon.\n\nXubuntu by default show images on buttons and in menus. User can disable the option \"Show images in menus\" in Appearance > Settings > Menus and Buttons. This will hide the icon in the menu all together, which includes application menu, context menu and panel menu.\nElse try to add other icons for the remaining launchers to make spacing equal, but the menu will appear unnatural due to wide spacing.\n\nExcept for \"Log Out...\" launcher, other actions will not display any confirmation dialog.\n\nUnlike Action Buttons, Launcher has no obvious way to show the confirmation dialog. This may be solved by assigning command each action with helper dialog in Zenity or configuring relevant key in GSettings, if any. I couldn't find any straightforward solution in this matter.\n\nOverall, I didn't find any serious caveats while using the Session Menu that has been created using Launcher. The substitute menu works as expected and could be improved by modifying the command to change the behaviour.\nTested setup in Xubuntu 14.04 (Xfce 4.10) and Xubuntu 16.04 (Xfce 4.12). Screenshots were taken using Xfce Screenshot and Shutter, arranged and color to alpha in GIMP, then added annotation using built-in editor in Shutter.\nTL;DR The Session menu has no such option to hide the user name. Use \"Launcher\" in Xfce panel to create the Session Menu without the user name.\n", "Q: Pinyin input for traditional Chinese characters? I read online (e.g. http://www.pinyinjoe.com/linux/ubuntu-910-openoffice-chinese-setup.htm) that ibus-chewing supports phonetic input of traditional characters using the pinyin system but I cannot get it to work under Ubuntu Oneiric. The problem boils down to being able to change the keyboard type which I cannot do using the interface provided. Any ideas?\n\nA: I just managed to find a solution to my own question. I still haven't been able to get chewing to work the way I want, but here is a fix using the pinyin input method.\nFirst of all, set \"Show language panel\" to always in the ibus preferences. At the moment, I cannot get the panel to integrate well with unity, so it does not seem to show unless forced to. Next, one of the buttons reads \"traditional\" and it toggles between simplified and traditional input. Voila!\nOne suggestion -- since the traditional characters tend to have more strokes, they can be tricky to read to an untrained eye (such as mine). For these purposes, increase the font size in the ibus preferences dialog (14+ looks best to me).\n\nA: Mine was a little different.

I use 3 different languages (English, Czech and Russian) every day. I'd prefer to switch (preferably globally, I don't like per-window) between them with Left+Alt+Shift.\nI'd also like to see the active language indication.\nUnfortunately I couldn't find any obvious way to set this up in XUbuntu 11.10 - there is even no keyboard indicator applet available in the panel configuration. Any recommendations?\n\nA: There is a keyboard layout plugin for xfce - xfce4-xkb-plugin. Install it, if it's not installed, then add it to the panel. Right click its icon and add the layouts you want.\nTo configure only keyboard shortcut use:\nsetxkbmap -option grp:switch,grp:alt_shift_toggle us,ru\n\n\nA: Ran into the same issue with xubuntu 13.04. The old way many online docos referred to (via Settings > Keyboard > Layout Options) no longer worked because there was no such button any more. Here is the new conventional (as in, no shell commands or X11 conf editing required) method that worked for me, in detail:\n\n\n*\n\n*Make sure the xfce4-xkb-plugin package has been installed (normally it should).\n\n*Right-click on the top panel and select Panel > Add New Items...\n\n*Select the Keyboard Layouts item from the list. A flag icon will appear in the panel.\n\n*Now right-click on the flag icon in the top panel and select Properties.\n\n*Now you will get the actual layout switch setup menu where you can choose your layout change key combo as well as customize other useful stuff including the list of layouts.\n\n\nP.S. I don't mind using the shell or editing the X11 configuration. For that matter, I love using the shell. However, I hate it when the shell needs to be used to set up a GUI. :)\n\nA: In my case I've needed to add Keyboard Layouts.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n", "Q: How to set up transparent background in XFCE terminal?

I have installed Ubuntu 11.04 desktop and I am in the process of learning. I want to install some applications from the Ubuntu Software Center, but the installation process is quite long and slow. With the Ubuntu Software Center, I can only install and download one application for a time. So I want to ask is there a way to speed up the process of installing software through the Ubuntu Software Center, like a multi-tasking program?\n\nA: Welcome to the Ubuntu Community!.\nThe installation times depends on several factors:\n\n\n*\n\n*Download Speed\n\n*Size of Packages\n\n*PC Hardware\n\n*Etc.\n\n\nYou can only install 1 package at the time, because that's how APT was created.\n\nA: Software Center is slow, so please close Software Center and use the quickest way to install packages, the terminal: press Ctrl + Alt + T to open and to install applications type:\nsudo apt-get install name_of_package1 name_of_package2 ...\nGive your user password when requested. You will not see any password screen when you type the password, so type then press Enter.\nAnother way that's quicker than the Software Center for installing packages is to use Synaptic.\n\nA: Lubuntu Software Center\nMaybe you would like to install lubuntu software center. It's the lightweight ubuntu software center, and it is much more simple too.\nTo install it:\n\n*\n\n*Slow but graphical Ubuntu Software Center way:\nclick here\n\n\n*\n\n*Fast but terminal way:\nYou'll have to type or copy-paste:\n sudo apt-get install lubuntu-software-center\n\n\n", "Q: Freeing up audio device I am trying to run an executable that plays a sound with the portaudio library.\nwhen I compile and run the filesystem I get the following error. \n\nError number: -9985 Error message: Device unavailable\n\nI am wondering how to free up the audio device and run the executable and return the audio device back to the way it was so I can use it with the system.\n\nA: Under Ubuntu, the pulseaudio daemon 'hogs' the audio devices. Instead of killing it, you can make it swallow your application's OSS output like this:\npadsp ./yourApp\nIf that doesn't work, here's a link bug report on how the fedora guys overcame a similar problem with audacity:\nhttps://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=445644\n", "Q: Where should I put newly build software? I have been curious for a long time about software installation in Linux (Ubuntu). Because I am so used to Windows OS, every software is installed by some sort of 'wizard', usually I don't need to configure anything, just click 'next' and that's it, but in Linux world, there are a lot of software need to be build by running some commend, typically, a bunch of .c files. Even I know the structures of the files system of Linux system, but I still don't fully understand where should each file go after a build, for example, some software have executables, and a config file, these two should be located separated somehow. And sometimes, in order to make the executable to be searchable, I can not simple put every thing in my custom folder. I feel strongly that there should be a convention for installing software in Linux box (especially for those need to be build from commend). So, is there a convention? How to make my installed software files well organized, so they are not falling apart.  \n\nA: All software written in languages like C, C++, Java, C#, etc, needs to be compiled. Whether you use Windows, OS X, Android, iOS, Ubuntu or any other GNU/Linux distro, this is equally true. It doesn't have anything to do with Linux, except that it's more common for people to distribute source code on Linux. In Windows you're usually only allowed to run the program and never will get the .c files, which explains what the program actually does to your system. \nIf you only get the source code, then that's a sure sign that the software is either extremely specialized or that it isn't meant to be used by casual users, but for developers. Otherwise, you would get a .deb file to double click. You don't need any wizards for that, except if the developers need you to configure it, in which case they will display dialogs. \nIn any case, the source package should have a build script that will place all the finished files in their right places. It really is quite simple. First you'll run a program to adapt the software to your system. Then you'll compile the software and then you'll install it. This is all automatic. The old way of doing this, is to run something like ./configure; make && sudo make install, but that will install the application outside the package system, which is a bad thing because it won't be uninstallable using the normal tools, and it may conflict with other software you install. So instead you'll use checkinstall to first create a package and then install that package. \nSo, this is what the process will normally look like:\n./configure\nmake\nsudo checkinstall\nIf you don't want to install the software in the normal places, then you can use ./configure --PREFIX=/some/directory (usually /opt) instead. \nThis page has detailed information with real examples: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/CompilingSoftware\n", "Q: Do I really have to HOLD the super key in Unity 2d? I am switching to 2d and it's looking good.  But it seems like I can't do my usual Super+... combinations.  For example, Super+F doesn't do anything.\nIt's running much faster and I'm really pleased with that.  There are a couple of things that don't seem to work so well, however.  If I want to switch between running applications (e.g. Super+2) nothing happens - it just opens the dash!  It seems I have to hold super down for half a second before I press 2.\nI don't mean to be picky, but half a second delays adds up to quite a lot in a full day's working.  Is there any way to get this instant like in 3d?\n\nA: If you have installed compizconfig-settings-manager (Type in the terminal sudo apt-get install compizconfig-settings-manager to install it), then type into the search filter Unity, and click on the Ubuntu Unity Plugin.\nWhere it says \"Key to show the launcher\", you can change that key from Super to Super+, thus reserving the Super key for other application usage.\n", "Q: \"/etc/grub.d/README: 6: Syntax error: \"(\" unexpected\" while upgrading grub package I am facing a problem while installing any program.

In the first screenshot a \"Label Empty\" text can be seen where it should say \"Log off\" (\"Cerrar sesión\" in spanish).\n\nThe second one shows de Log off screen dialog, where te button is actually empty (says nothing) and there are some strange characters in the question dialog.\n\nDoes anybody know how to fix these?\n\nA: Reinstalling the packages won't necessarily help because localization info was separated in Ubuntu. You may want to open Settings, Language support (icon with United Nations flag) and see if it prompts for localization not being completely installed.\nThe font issue is specially challenging because these Unicode symbols should be supported by default. If you type locale at a terminal, will the output look like LANG=es_ES.UTF-8 ? If it is, try selecting a different font like 'Ubuntu' or 'Sans' in the Appearance settings.\n\nA: Changing the file /etc/enviroment this way could help:\nLANGUAGE=\"es_ES:es:en_GB:en\"\nLANG=\"es_ES.UTF-8\"\n\nThis page (spanish) describes how the locales work in Ubuntu, and lists the configuration files involved.\nhttp://misdocumentos.net/wiki/linux/locales\n", "Q: Windows appear behind the panel When opening new windows in my Ubuntu 11.04 sometimes they are hidden behind the panel.

Indeed it could be fixed with compiz:\nenable \"Place Windows\" in Category/Windows Management.\n\nA: I had this too on a machine that was all the way upgraded from Intrepid and the problem did not appear for a dummy new user I created for investigation purposes. This is how I solved it:\nI logged out of unity, switched to a virtual terminal hitting AltF1, logged in as root, killed all remaining processes from my usual login with killall -u <login>, did a cd /home/<login> and a mv .gconf .gconf-old. When logging back in, the issue had disappeared with a lot of others for the price of losing some configurations which I considered a bargain.\nAfter some diffing .gconf with .gconf-old with meld, I reached at the conclusion that some pre-natty compiz settings were the most probable cause, but your mileage may vary.\n\nA: First, install compizconfig-settings-manager\nsudo apt install compizconfig-settings-manager\n\nThen search compizconfig-settings-manager from search panel\n\nNow scroll down to the opened to the compizconfig window and go to the Window Management\n\nEnable Place Windows\n", "Q: Unity launcher crashes and leaves ghost shadow Sometimes my Unity launcher crashes and shows and undesirable behaviour: although it still hides, it leaves a ghost shadow behind it.

Note that the latter will replace your launcher icons with original ones that came with installation (you will loose current config)\nIf that does not resolve the issue add unity daily ppa and update your unity version.

I have a two monitor setup, one 22\" (1680x1050 res., 16:10) and another 19\" (1280x1024 res. 5:4). I've installed ubuntu 11.10 beta2 x86, and the installation worked fine, the system boot was successful. I've upgraded ubuntu from the main server, and after restart, booting with the kernel 3.0.0-13, my system hangs up with a purple screen, and than nothing happens (the system boots successful with the kernel image 3.0.0-8). Nvidia current drivers not installed, but if i install it, the situation is the same. I have an Nvidia 9600GT installed.\nI tried to boot with one screen attached, I've tried each port, but no luck at all. With kernel image 3.0.0-8 the system successfully boots with each display attached, but the farther kernels (3.0.0-11; 3.0.0-12; ect.) all freezes, even one display, or multiple attached. I have two systems with ubuntu installed, and the other (with Ati HD 2400XT, latest closed drivers) don't have any issues like this, I wrote about.\nUpdate:\nThe problem solved by reinstalling the operatin system, without automatically installing updates during install, with only one monitor attached. After completing installation, and clean reboot, i've installed closed nVidia drivers. After all, i found it's safe to connect another monitor to the system, it's not causing any problems. Probably the situation stays like this.\n\nA: The OP answered the question in the question \n\nUpdate: The problem solved by reinstalling the operatin system, without automatically installing updates during install, with only one monitor attached. After completing installation, and clean reboot, i've installed closed nVidia drivers\n\n\nA: Yes, there is an issue with booting with dual monitors in Ubuntu.  This is a known issue.  One that I have encountered as well.  One workaround is booting with only the main screen attached, and then plugging in the second one after the boot process is complete.  Of course, that is rather annoying.\n", "Q: Facebook in online accounts I have g-mail configured in online accounts. But when trying to add other accounts, such as Facebook and Linkedin, I am not able to do so, since the account type I am able to select is only google. Is there a way to add Facebook account type to online accounts? If yes, can you please guide me to the proper steps?\n\nA: Yes, the online accounts dialog is only a shortcut, meant to configure many applications at once. Facebook is supported in two ways in Ubuntu by default; as a social network and as a chat service. To setup the social networking part, you'll open Broadcasting from the messaging menu (the one with an envelope). It will ask you to enter details for the various networks, including Facebook. To configure instant messaging, open Instant Messaging from the messaging menu. It will also ask for account details. Afterwards, you'll have both Gmail and Facebook chat in Empathy. You can also ask to be notified when users log on and off, which means when they open Facebook or Gmail in their browsers, or when they start Empathy if they've set it up like you. You do that in Edit > Preferences in Empathy. \n", "Q: Can I stop apps from selecting \"Recently Used\" by default in file chooser dialogs? In Ubuntu and Kubuntu 11.10 I see changes in behaviour of GTK file chooser dialog. When I try to open new file (second, third etc, not first in editor) dialog show \"Recenty used\" section. It is very unsuitable for me, in 10.04 dialog shows folder where located previous open file. Anybody knows how i can bring back old behaviour?\n\nA: I was also bugged by this behaviour and gave it a closer look during the last days.\nI have found only one of the GTK3 applications so far that always brings up Recently Used at fresh start: Gedit. All other apps I have tested (Totem, Eog, Evince, File-Roller, ...) start with a \"normal\" folder in their file chooser (tested with fresh guest session).\nSo I did a small patch that makes Gedit fall back on the Home folder instead of Recently Used: http://pastebin.com/GhXCRzNV\nI can also provide a debdiff if requested, or create a PPA.\n\nA: For GTK2 you want to edit $XDG_CONFIG_HOME/gtk-2.0/gtkfilechooser.ini and set\nStartupMode=cwd\n\nFor GTK3 there is no way to change it. In older versions this command might work\ngsettings set org.gtk.Settings.FileChooser startup-mode cwd\n\n\nA: Maybe it would be easier to patch gtk3 to populate the recently used files with the folder the last file was in as well. I think that would work nicely for me.\n\nA: To my knowledge, this is a \"feature\" of GTK+ 3.x, and I'm not so certain it can be changed.\nIf I find a solution I will update my answer, but for now I don't know of any (other than reporting a bug).\nUpdate:\nI believe I may have found a partial solution. It's not a permanent one unfortunately.\n\n\n*\n\n*Install dconf-tools.\n\n*Run dconf-editor.\n\n*Navigate to org.gtk.settings.file-chooser.\n\n*Change the last-folder-uri value to the folder of your choosing, for example file:///home/rolandixor/Desktop.\n\n*Your file chooser dialogues should now use this folder by default. However, they will revert to recently used if you use the dialogue but do not actually open/save a file.\n\n\nUpdate2:\nAs this is rather tricky, here is another possible solution (partial):\n\n\n*\n\n*Open gedit.\n\n*Open a file (from the folder you want to use).\n\n*Save a file (save as) to the folder you want to use.\n\n*Close gedit. This will only work if you actually open a file from a folder and save to a folder. If you open the dialogue and don't do anything, it will revert when you close it. There is no way around this.\n\n\nA: last-folder-uri will get changed the next time you use the file chooser, instead you need to set startup-mode:\nInstall dconf-editor via Software center:\n\nor via cli\n\nsudo dnf install dconf-editor\n\nLaunch it, then navigate to org.gtk.settings.file-chooser.startup-mode\n\nIt doesn't seem possible to access this key from dconf cli, instead you can look at gsettings:\ngsettings set org.gtk.gtk4.Settings.FileChooser startup-mode 'cwd'\n\nIf you're getting an error that gsettings is using the memory backend, then you probably need to check which gsettings executable you're using:\nwhich gsettings\n# MYHOME/.asdf/shims/gsettings\n\n(in my case, I'd forgotten that I'd installed anaconda python with asdf which brings in a whole lot of unnecessary shims)\nasdf uninstall python anaconda-2018.12\n\n\nA: Also you could use shortcut for revealing Location input box and going to desired directory: ~ (tilde sign), Shift-` on some keyboards.\n", "Q: Ubuntu One not syncing I am really starting to despair as I have been trying Ubuntu One for several months, trying it on several machines, and it has caused me loads of different issues wasting me a lot of time.

Neverwinter Nights is a game by Bioware. They have released a Linux version which is inconvenient to install. It's nothing more than copying stuff around but it can be messed up. The game files can be downloaded on their website but require your serial key to run the game. This can be bought online if you do not have the CD-version of the game (Windows only).\nI tried and failed in creating a .deb package (never done that before) to automate this and am now interested in using quickly to create a GUI version Ubuntu installer for Neverwinter Nights. If possible, I would link to the \"buy serial key online\" URL directly from the GUI installer.\nIf I am successful I would like to see this in the Ubuntu Software Center. Having a highly popular classic RPG in there cannot hurt.\nI am not sure if this is prohibited by copyright laws and if I should even bother with it if it is.\nWhat do you think?\n\nA: I can think of two ways in which you can put up an application\n\n\n*\n\n*A game which is Open Source as per Open Source Initiative definition\n\n*Proprietory game whose copyrights is held by you\n\n\nIt would be worth telling how flash is installed on your computer. When you select to install the package flashplugin-nonfree the package actually downloads the flash plugin at that moment and copies the file to appropriate place. This is why this package is not present in main or universe repository\nI am not a lawyer, but I think you can create a small application which downloads the game and the serial key. Distributing it would be tricky. \n\n\n*\n\n*Many games want to control how their software is being distributed. They might not like that you are circumventing their distribution model. They might have ads on their download page.\n\n*Even if it won't be illegal, legal department of those companies might want to clock extra hours by showing that they are working to protect the Intellectual property. You might receive a warning letter. Even worse, they might call it \"voluntary copyright violation\"\n\n\nIt is more of trust. Distros know that Adobe wants flash to be installed everywhere, so Adobe won't come after them. The case of these games is not clear.\nMy best solution would be to contact those game developers and ask them to put their games in Ubuntu Software Center. That is the safest bet.\n", "Q: How to change default Dash Home name?

As bzip2 claims to compress best (in size), I decided to use it. The working server can offer 24 (virtuals) CPUs (4 real  X5650  @ 2.67GHz) - and thus I decided to look for parallel variants.\nUsing debian stable - sorry, but I found best matches here in askubuntu - I decided to take a closer look at pbzip2and lbzip2.\nBut what to select? In actual stable pbzip2 is in version 1.1.1-1and lbzip2 in version 0.23-1. That might cosmetically tend to pbzip2 - but lbzip2 says it is even on single-core computers faster. On the other hand pbzip2 claims to be completely compatible with bzip2 v1.0.2.\nAdditionally I have some timing-values of a big local job:\nUsing lbzip2 \nCommand being timed: \"tar -cjf /tmp/mapleTAsicherung.lbzip2.tar /bin /etc /lib /lib32 /opt /sbin /selinux /usr\"\n    User time (seconds): 2134.32\n    System time (seconds): 39.24\n    Percent of CPU this job got: 2099%\n    Elapsed (wall clock) time (h:mm:ss or m:ss): 1:43.51\n    Average shared text size (kbytes): 0\n    Average unshared data size (kbytes): 0\n    Average stack size (kbytes): 0\n    Average total size (kbytes): 0\n    Maximum resident set size (kbytes): 1509088\n    Average resident set size (kbytes): 0\n    Major (requiring I/O) page faults: 0\n    Minor (reclaiming a frame) page faults: 1054467\n    Voluntary context switches: 153901\n    Involuntary context switches: 235285\n    Swaps: 0\n    File system inputs: 0\n    File system outputs: 3460632\n    Socket messages sent: 0\n    Socket messages received: 0\n    Signals delivered: 0\n    Page size (bytes): 4096\n    Exit status: 0  \n\nUsing pbzip2 \n    Command being timed: \"tar -cjf /tmp/mapleTAsicherung.pbzip2.tar /bin /etc /lib /lib32 /opt /sbin /selinux /usr\"\n    User time (seconds): 3158.18\n    System time (seconds): 59.80\n    Percent of CPU this job got: 2095%\n    Elapsed (wall clock) time (h:mm:ss or m:ss): 2:33.56\n    Average shared text size (kbytes): 0\n    Average unshared data size (kbytes): 0\n    Average stack size (kbytes): 0\n    Average total size (kbytes): 0\n    Maximum resident set size (kbytes): 1436320\n    Average resident set size (kbytes): 0\n    Major (requiring I/O) page faults: 0\n    Minor (reclaiming a frame) page faults: 477683\n    Voluntary context switches: 151326\n    Involuntary context switches: 339246\n    Swaps: 0\n    File system inputs: 0\n    File system outputs: 3460536\n    Socket messages sent: 0\n    Socket messages received: 0\n    Signals delivered: 0\n    Page size (bytes): 4096\n    Exit status: 0\n\nWhat should one use? What are the major differences? At the moment I tend towards lbzip2.\n\nA: I did some comparison benchmarks for bzip2 vs pbzip2 and lbzip2 along with lzip and plzip at http://vbtechsupport.com/1614/. I'm liking the speed improvments for lbzip2 as long as you have enough memory that is.\n\nA: Here's a basic idea how to evaluate them.\nTake a big tarball of the kind you usually work with. Compress it with bzip2, pbzip2, lbzip2. Measure the (wall clock) times and save all the outputs in different files. This will give you three times and three file sizes.\nThen iterate over all three output files (ie. the compression outputs of bzip2, pbzip2, lbzip2), and decompress each with all three utilities (bzip2, pbzip2, and lbzip2). This will give you further nine times.\nRe-run the twelve tests under some profiler and get a peak memory usage (virtual and RSS) for each. Again, this will yield 12 values. (If your Linux is configured to no overcommit, then you're interested in VSZ. Otherwise you care about RSS).\nMake a table with 12 rows for these data points -- col1: 3 compressed sizes, col2: 3 compression times / 9 decompression times, col3: 12 peak mems -- and choose what suits you best. You should factor in how often you compress vs. how often you decompress.\nI use lbzip2-0.23, but I wrote it, so it doesn't count.\nFinally, no matter which one proves best for you, always save a checksum of the uncompressed tarball, plus verify your saved file before declaring the backup \"done\".\nFILES=...\nOUTDIR=/mnt/archive\nBZ2_UTIL=...\n\n(\n  tar -c -- $FILES \\\n  | tee >(sha256sum >\"$OUTDIR\"/myfiles.tar.sha256) \\\n  | pv -c -N plain 2>/dev/tty \\\n  | \"$BZ2_UTIL\" \\\n  | pv -c -N compr 2>/dev/tty \\\n  > \"$OUTDIR\"/myfiles.tar.bz2\n) 2>\"$OUTDIR\"/myfiles.err\n\n\"$BZ2_UTIL\" -dc -- \"$OUTDIR\"/myfiles.tar.bz2 \\\n| sha256sum -c -- \"$OUTDIR\"/myfiles.tar.sha256\n\n", "Q: PC shuts down when installing ubuntu? I'm now using ubuntu from USB, and I'd like to install ubuntu on my hard disk. \nI tried the option of removing Vista while installing ubuntu.\nHowever, near the end of the installation process (presumably the end because I can see some slideshows on how to start using ubuntu), the screen suddenly goes to black with white words running around on it. Soon the computer shuts down.\nAfter that, restarting leads to a black screen with only a small white cursor on the top left corner. The cursor keeps blinking and nothing happens. \nI found that I can alternatively choose to boot with USB by hitting F12 just when the computer starts. So I tried to reinstall ubuntu by running ubuntu on USB. One of the options of installation is to update ubuntu 11.04 to ubuntu 11.04, so it seems the ubuntu is already installed somehow. \nAnyways, I tried both update and delete and install option but the same thing happens as the 1st time (sometimes before reaching the end), while I still cannot start my PC as ubuntu (without USB).\nHow may I install ubuntu properly?\n\nA: I have had almost the same problem when installing Ubuntu 11.10 on my laptop.  For some reason I do not get the usual installation graphical interface, however I get to install Ubuntu.  But after installation is complete, I reboot the machine remove the pendrive and Ubuntu starts loading but then it stops, a cursor appears on the upper left corner of the screen and nothing else happens... ever again!!.\nI thought it may be an issue of the pendrive, since the installation interface was not as expected for 11.10, so I burn a Live CD and rebooted from it.  So far the installation process has no problems and its graphical interface is working fine.  I will report back after installation is completed.  So far it seems that the problem was the USB installer being faulty.\n\nA: Please try to add nomodeset to your kernel option at boot... if it work please read:\nhttp://ubuntu-tutorials.com/2010/05/06/ubuntu-10-04-lucid-blank-screen-at-startup-workaround/\nto made this option as permanent...\n", "Q: Can I develop ubuntu apps in Gambas As this new platform is released where developers can publish there apps, I would like to know if Gambas applications are good enough to submit.\nGambas is in my opinion the easiest way to develop applications for Linux with a very flat learning curve. Why use only \"Quickly\"? I think Gambas should also be mentioned on the website.\nAre there ways can I submit an application created in Gambas?\n\nA: Applications can be written in whatever language/framework you want to write them in, they just need to follow the publishing requirements: \n\n  \n*\n  \n*Be in one, self-contained directory\n  \n*Be able to be installed into /opt/\n  \n*Be able to be executed by all users from /opt/\n  \n*Note: Users only have read and not write privileges to this\n  directory.\n  \n*Write all configuration settings to ~/. (This can be one\n  file or a directory containing multiple configuration files.)\n  \n\n\nA: It is possible to develop gambas applications in Ubuntu, yes. I don't agree at all that it is the easiest way to learn, however. Ubuntu supports all programming languages you've heard of, and a lot of languages you've never heard of. But programming with Python, GTK and Quickly is insanely much easier, faster and more fun than programming from scratch with Gambas.  \n", "Q: Unable to load live usb I have created a bootable USB with ubuntu 10.10 with usb-creator-gtk from terminal. How ever it is not getting booted. It keeps loading in the ubuntu main screen.. Is there a way to debug this problem and find the cause?\n\nA: When you boot, at the boot splash, edit the boot line (usually hit the tab key) and edit (remove) the quiet and splash options.\n\nA: At least here with 10.10 when booting it would just go to a console & not load the session.\nThe only way would be to type this & press enter\nlive\n\nThough not sure if that's what you're seeing based on question's description\n\nA: I had similar problem, Ubuntu hanging during install from usb 3.0 slot.

Ever. But what you should be able to do, is to boot a usb session, delete everything on your root file system except /home and resize it. Then you can create a separate partition for /home and move the files onto it and then install. (Please investigate this before you start doing anything)\nBut in any case, you should not install a different version of Ubuntu without cleaning the root file system first.

And here is the video demonstrating How to download YouTube videos using the ss trick. Let's say you want to download the below video:\n\nOn your address bar, add ss in front of youtube.com and hit Enter ↵.\n\nNow you will be redirected to savefrom.net. On your right, click on the video quality you want to download.\n\n\nA: There is this Greasemonkey script on userscripts.org. But I cannot vouch for it. Nor I can assert the security of such a script.\nBut it seems to work.\nYou will need to install Greasemonkey.\n\nA: There are so many ways of downloading YouTube videos. \nApplication:\nPersonally I have used MiniTube as my application of choice for getting videos from YouTube. It's a real simple approach. Find the video by keyword, then download it. \nCommand Line:\nIf you feel comfortable with the command line interface (or CLI as it is known) through your terminal application, try the youtube-dl command line approach. \nWebsites:\nWebsites like MediaConvertor or Vixy Freecoder can do this without the need of installing extensions for Firefox or Chrome/Chromium or native applications.\nThese 2 websites allows you to download in different formats. Both audio and Video formats. You plug in the link to the video on their site and wait for the conversion to complete and then you get the link for the download.\nThe bonus to the sites is that they are cross-platform much like the extensions approach. But if you want to free your browser from the clutter of extra things, then try the sites or the other suggestions others have mentioned. \n\nA: Solved with a small shell script:\n\n#!/bin/bash\n#\n# grabflash\n#\n# Finds any cached Flash videos in the kernel file handles list\n# and copies them to the user Videos folder ; this gets around\n# the new Flash players habit of opening a cache file in /tmp\n# and immediately deleting it.\n#\n# Usage: Play the video until it's all cached.

Other than the fact that you can't\ndownload videos with more than 1080p quality is a nice quick GUI for\nYouTube download.\nThis is the 64 version and the 32 version. Just download and install from Ubuntu Software Center.\nThen you straight up download videos. If you want the other\navailable formats (*.mp3 and more 'someone said it's useful') you are going to need FFmpeg and libavcodec-extra-53.\nSo run\n$ sudo apt-get install libavcodec-extra-53\n\n$ sudo apt-get install ffmpeg\n\nIt really comes in-handy.\n\nA: Those answers are too complex, so I'm going to help you without installing anything.\nFirst go to your browser and enter this in the URL tab.\nNext, enter the YouTube URL in the first box. For example, I'm going to use a Ubuntu YouTube link.\n\nThen press Continue.\nNow, once you pressed Continue, this will pop up.\n\nAt the Detected Media tab, you can choose the quality of your video. \n720p is HD.\n480p is HQ.\n360p is SQ.\n3GP is MV.\nEach type of quality takes up memory and downloading time depending on your internet. Just mess around and see what you like.\nNow, at the File Name tab, you can change the name of the video when you download it. This is completely optional as you can change the name of it using the rename tab when you right click on it.\nNext, you can change the type of video you want. For example, you want it to go on your iPod, you can easily change it to MP3.\nI would highly recommend using MP4 as its most commonly used.\n\nFinally, you can now press the Start! button to start the download!\n\nEnjoy! =)\n\nA: As of now there is the GUI for a popular Youtube-dl available.

Left click is resulting in random click/movements and it's not an hardware issue, because it's working on windows. Maybe a driver issue?\nI noticed somebody is having the same problem: http://logs.ubuntu-eu.org/freenode5/2011/09/18/%23ubuntu-bugs.html\nAny ideas?\n\nA: Okay, I digged some further into the issue. I already suspected the programmability of the G300 might have something to do with it. And when you enter \nxinput list, it shows the G300 as both a mouse and a keyboard. In my case the G300 keyboard entry has id 12.\nxinput list-props 12 gives all properties of the G300 keyboard. It includes this line: \n\nDevice Enabled (146): 1  \n\nwhich means that if we set the property with id 146 to a value of 0 for device id 12, the G300 keyboard is disabled.\nUsing \nxinput set-prop 12 146 0\n\nhttp://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=1849041&highlight=g300\n\nA: There is a package in Software Center that may work for you - try lomoco\n\nFurther details on using this on the community wiki.\nStart with lomoco -s to test compatibility.\n\nA: I have found a more convenient workaround for the issue and maybe why it works fine on Fedora. I have just set the mode of the keyboard part of the mouse to relative. In my case:\nxinput set-mode 12 RELATIVE\nWhere 12 is the ID of the G300 keyboard. Now that I have done that my mouse recognizes the keys the way I mapped them with the Logitech software under Windows.\nHope that helps you, guys get a better use of the mouse.\n\nA: It's been reported on ubuntuforums in a thread linked to here that the logitech software doesn't work under virtualbox+WinXP.  I got it to run, but only seemed to be able to configure 1 mode, and the mode switch button cycles the mode light off-off-red (the mode I configured last was red)\nYou'll want another mouse plugged in as well  for this:\n\n\n*\n\n*Set up a USB filter for the logitech mouse in virtualbox (you'll lose the mouse in your host OS when the VM is running)\n\n*Install the logitech software under XP\n\n*reboot the VM repeatedly until no more new hardware found\n\n*using the other mouse you plugged in earlier, run the logitech software and configure (bizarrely the G300 has an effect in the logitech software but doesn't move the pointer)\n\n*be sure that you are saving the config to the onboard memeory\n\n*close the VM to test (you can leave it paused)\n\n\nEdit: Once the mouse has been configured under windows it will behave the same under ubuntu (or indeed if you take it to another machine).\nThis script from the linked ubuntuforums thread may help to set to mode on boot:\n#!/bin/sh\nG300_XINPUT_ID=$(xinput list | egrep --color=never \"G300.*keyboard\" | sed -r 's/.*id=([0-9]+).*/\\1/')\nxinput set-mode ${G300_XINPUT_ID} RELATIVE\n\nEdit 2: If you use the VM for other things, you'll probably want to disable the filter after setting up the mouse, otherwise your mouse won't work with your VM running\n", "Q: Is it possible to prioritize which folders get synced first when using Ubuntu One? I face the problem that u1 syncs my files to a given order. I'd like to change that order. Consider that: On a week end I work and I may also copy the content of my photo SD card onto my notebook. The next time I boot my work computer, I might be sitting there and waiting for some hours until U1 synced/downloaded all the photos to my workstation and the files I need for work are the last in the '--waiting' list. \nI don't mind if Ubuntu One is a slow downloader, I would be just happy if I could define that all files in a certain folder (and all of it subfolders) always need to be downloaded first. \nI'm aware that there was once the possibility to move some files to the beginning of the sync list. But that was a very clumsy way with providing the folder id etc. and in the current version of u1 I can't even find it any more. \nAny suggestions on how to prioritize always the same folder?\n\nA: Short answer is no, there is no way to prioritize the order in which files are synchronized. There is however, a workaround for situations like yours.\nInstead of having all files under the ~/Ubuntu One folder, you can have different files under different folders within your home directory, which are each individually synchronized with Ubuntu One. You can then choose to only have certain folders synchronized to certain machines, and you can disable and enable the folders being synchronized on any one machine, in the Ubuntu One control panel application. Thus you could disable ~/Photos from being synchronized, until after ~/Documents has finished synchronizing, for example.\n", "Q: How can I make nautilus use my installed FUSE file systems automatically? Is there a way to have Nautilus automatically use my FUSE file systems to (for example) open ISOs as folders, or archives as folders, or what ever other 'locations' FUSE supports?\n\nA: Nautilus can't possibly 'know' any installed fuse driver because the fuse system does not advertise its drivers mount options and whereabouts by itself. There isn't even a common database defined where the installed fuse drivers register themselves yet. \nNote also that the gvfs system handles URIs like smb:// while the fuse driver underneath does not, therefore your preferred fuse driver needs to be supported by gvfs first before it can land in nautilus.\nHowever, there are lots of nautilus-action scripts around that may accomplish what you need. And if you can type in the mount options by hand, a xfce-tool named gigolo can help you to keep your fuse mounts bookmarked.\n", "Q: Installing Unity on 10.04 for netbooks I have installed Ubuntu 10.04 LTS netbook version and it comes with an annoying user interface.

Looking on Google I couldn't find any more help on the subject.\n(before you ask me why I haven't installed 11.04, that's because it would not start up from the live CD at all)\n\nA: Unity is not available for 10.04 LTS.\nHowever, the LTS is only for desktops - as per the Ubuntu Wiki\n\nIn 10.04, the Netbook Edition was not an LTS.\n\nIt is recommended that you download 11.04 again, run a checksum to make sure the file is OK, and then try again - be patient, the 11.04 LiveCD takes a long time (about 4-5 minutes for me) to boot up.\n\nA: Here a video about install Unity Netbook edition, feel free to try before to install 11.04\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ekCFCJsMmZM\n", "Q: What fanless ATI Radeon cards work with the open-source drivers?

If this error doesn't show as root (using sudo), this is probably a permissions problem. You should check the permissions of /dev/input/mice.\nIt is likely that once the mouse problem is fixed it will show the same behaviour as when run using sudo. It might not be worth the trouble to try getting it running with framebuffer. Without knowing the details I'd say using X might a better solution.\n\nA: First issue :\nmeans you have no pxe bootrom images installed. try installing them, or look them up in /usr/share/qemu or /usr/share/gpxe\nsudo apt-file search pxe-rtl8139.bin\n\nsays that this file is in the kvm-pxe package.

I once installed Opera by adding their repository to my sources.list:\ndeb http://deb.opera.com/opera/ stable non-free #Opera\n\nSince then I get regular updates via the usual \"apt-get update && apt-get upgrade\", the last some weeks ago to Opera 11.51. Since then, Opera regularly (once every some days, sometimes more often) crashes (browser window disappears, and then the error reporting dialog comes up). (The same happens on OpenSUSE, where I had the upgrade last week, thus it is not Ubuntu-specific.)\nThis just occurred again (while I was typing an answer to a question on another Stack Exchange site) and I don't want to tolerate it any longer.\nIs there an easy way to downgrade to an older version (like 11.50, which didn't had this problem), and still have the possibility to get the upgrade query when the next version comes out (which hopefully fixes this)?\n\nA: You can control which versions of packages are installed by creating version pins. You will need to add an entry to /etc/apt/preferences:\n Package: <package>\n Pin: <pin definition>\n Pin-Priority: <pin's priority>\n\nBy specifying Pin-Priority you can control if a package going to be replaced by a newer version when the latter comes out etc. A negative priority would prevent a package from being ever installed - I think that's what you could use in your case, if you want to skip a particular version:\n Package: opera\n Pin: 11.51\n Pin-Priority: -1\n\nI didn't test it, but I think uninstalling opera, then creating a version pin and then installing it again would install an older version, and then upgrade it to a newer one when it's available.\nYou can read the documentation for more details. Typing man apt_preferences in terminal would also give you some info.\nOf course, removing the PPA and managing versions manually is also an option, but where's fun in that? :)\n\nA: Firstly Remove all programs which may be Opera related. Then go to Software Sources and disable the\ndeb http://deb.opera.com/opera/ stable non-free #Opera\nrepository, do a sudo apt-get update and then go to Opera's download site and download the version you want.

Press Alt+F2 and write gksu <application name>\n\nA: We don't use a password for the root account in Ubuntu. Instead, you prepend the command with sudo, so that instead of /etc/init.d/someservice start, you'll run sudo /etc/init.d/someservice start. There are many benefits to this approach. First of all, you don't have to be root all the time, but instead run single commands as root. That also means each command gets logged and that different users can run root commands without sharing a password. It also enables you to fine-tune access. You can enable a user to run a specific command as root without giving complete access to the root account. \n", "Q: How to use two sound sources while using recordMyDesktop? I'm using recordMyDesktop and here is my problem: I need to record the sound emitted by my desktop and put some comments on it at the same time.\nFor now, I have no problem commenting what's on screen, my microphone records my voice correctly, but there is any way I can record the sound made by the software as well?\n\nA: Yes, you can achieve that!\nThe proper way to do this is to use JACK sound server, which is fully supported by recordMyDesktop. There is a nice GUI app for controlling it (though it's name is terrifying) - qjackctl.\nYou will want to use the Connections window of qjackctl, it will allow you to learn which audio input is which, and will enable you to direct both your system input & microphone input to your system speakers.\nOnce your JACK server is running, launch recordMyDesktop. If you use gtk-recordMyDesktop you will be provided with a list of all JACK channels in the settings window (make sure to choose two with the Ctrl key in order get stereo sound!). If you run recordMyDesktop from command-line, you will need to experiment with command-line parameters, but that shouldn't be too hard.\nInstead of routing all audio you want to record to system speakers, you might also experiment with different JACK connection schemes.

Otherwise I have both, Unity and Docky, managing my open windows, which is a waste of space.\nThere has already been a question about unchecking the named option, what seems to be not possible by default: \"uncheck-manage-windows-without-launcher\"\nThe answer was an explanation, why one of the docks in Docky does have to manage windows.\nI am searching for a tweak, to change that behavior.\nSince there is a tweak to hide the \"Anchor-Icon\" in Docky \"Remove Anchor in Docky\", maybe it is possible to hide Docky's \"window-manager\" as well.\n\nA: To my knowledge, you cannot stop Docky from using the window manager feature. The best you can do is find another Dock that allows you to do that.\n\nA: You could go to this site which I am sure will fix the problem.\nIt worked for me.\nhttp://wiki.go-docky.com/index.php?title=Documentation\nand click on Super Secret GConf Settings under Expert Settings and you will find that you can change the WindowManager from True to False\nAll the best\nDavid\n", "Q: PHP using different libxml2 version, than the one installed in /usr/lib/ I tried to install Mediawiki, which told me to update my libxml2 to at least version 2.7.3.\nSo I've checked that and found /usr/lib/libxml2.so.2.7.6 to be installed. xml2-config --version also returns 2.7.6. But when reading the outputs of phpinfo(); it tells me the libXML Compiled Version is 2.6.32.\nHow can I tell PHP to use the correct libxml2, while avoiding recompiling anything by hand, as I like to use the Ubuntu package-upgrades in the future.\nI'm currently running Ubuntu 10.04.3 (lucid) LTS and having installed the PHP5 and libapache-mod-php5 packages from the main sources (PHP 5.3.5-0.dotdeb.0).\n\nA: PHP 5.3.5-0.dotdeb.0 indicates that the php packages that you have installed are from dotdeb.org, rather than the main archive. These packages are not compiled for Ubuntu, but for Debian, and it's likely that these were built against an older version of libxml2.\nYou would be better off using the php5 packages from Ubuntu, or if a more recent version is needed, to use packages from a trusted PPA.\n", "Q: Procedure to follow after a distro upgrade For non rolling release like Ubuntu, I'm always confused on what to do after an upgrade.\nIn a very short time 11.10 will be released. So I'm asking what to do after the upgrade.\nThe objective is to preserve the system as it was, taking advantage of the new features and the new versions of apps, but preserve the stability of the system, as get the same documents, ppa's, applications installed, and settings. \n\n\n*\n\n*In case of upgrade using the update manager, what I should do after,\nin order to preserve the ppa's i had but updated for the new release? And what things should I do in general?\n\n*In case of a fresh install, with separate home partition that will\nnot be touched or changed, what should I do, in order to get the\nppa's as they were updated for the new version? How do I preserve\nall the settings and apps? And what general things I should do?\nP.S. I'm not interested in the upgrade itself, it's the various actions to do after the upgrade on both occasions, fresh or not. It's about time to explain this aspect for new and old users. \n\nA: User configurations are completely independent on the operating system. As long as you don't touch the users home, the settings will be automatically applied. No action required.\nWith regards to PPA, you'll have to add them afterwards since it will be different software. You can not depend on a PPA being available for new versions. It's up to the developers of the application to make sure it'll be available for future versions. \n", "Q: Restart an application if taking lot of memory How can I restart an application if it's taking a lot of say CPU utilization or taking too much RAM on Linux, is there any shell script to do the same?\n\nA: Why would you want to use a script to do that? Close the application. Or, in the system monitor, end or kill the process. If you don't want to use the GUI, then you can open a terminal, run ps ax to find the process ID and use kill prosessid to end it. Use the -9 switch to use force, but avoid that whenever possible. \n", "Q: Ubuntu hangs while booting Yesterday i closed my PC properly.

I just discovered that Synaptic on my Oneiric installation displays about 55 thousand packages instead of 35. About 20 of these have a name ending with :i386. I also recently read in the Oneiric Beta release notes that the AMD-64-version of has better handling of 32-bit code. I guess these two facts are related. Seamless installation of 32-bit coden on 64-bit installation is explained here. \nAre there any optimizations (kernel specific I guess) regarding its execution?\n\nA: No. The multiarch changes only relate to the way executables and libraries are packaged and installed to the system. There is no change to the way the code is executed, nor any changes to the kernel.\nIn a nutshell:\nUbuntu has 64 bit and 32 bit versions. In order to run 32 bit software (the main one being Adobe Flash) on the 64 bit version of Ubuntu, you need some 32 bit support libraries. \nUnder the old system, all these libraries existed in 32 bit form in the 32 bit version of Ubuntu, but you could not use those packages as they would overwrite your 64 bit versions. So these 32 bit libraries had to be specially packaged for the 64 bit version, into a single package called ia32-libs. This package was huge (the source was several gigabytes) and constantly needed new libraries adding to it. \nUnder multiarch, you just install packages from the 32 bit and 64 bit repositories side by side, which is much simpler for everyone.\n", "Q: Where are startup commands stored? When you go to \"Startup Applications\", you see a list of commands that are executed at startup and you can add your own.\nI would like to know where this list is stored. Is it in gconf somewhere?\nThere are two reasons I want to know this:\n\n\n*\n\n*add commands programmatically\n\n*disable some commands (in Oneiric, the default ones are not shown anymore)\n\n\nA: I use xfce and what I have found is most of system related autostart commands such as\npower-managers, gnome-keyring, ubuntuone, blueman etc\nare stored in /etc/xdg/autostart while most of user specific autostart are located at\n$HOME/.config/autostart You may have a look at those 2 places.\nTo disable something to autostart, set Hidden=false under [Desktop Entry] section in the respective file under $HOME. You may have to create the file.\n\nA: As per the Desktop Application Autostart Specification, which Ubuntu and all major desktop environments like Gnome, LXDE, XFCE follow, the Startup Applications are .desktop files stored per-user in\n~/.config/autostart\n\nAnd also globally, for all users, in\n/etc/xdg/autostart\n\n(this is a simplification, the real directories are determined by XDG Base Directory Specification)\nThe enable/disable feature is provided by this attribute in each .desktop file:\nX-GNOME-Autostart-enabled=true (or false)\n\nIf a user toggles enable/disable status of a given application (without deleting it) that was in the system folder, it is copied to the user directory and then the attribute X-GNOME-Autostart-enabled is changed. If a user deletes a given application from the list, the .desktop is copied to user folder with the Hidden=true attribute (or the file is simply deleted if it was present just in the user directory)\nFiles in both user and system folder does not need to be marked as executable. Default permission is 644 (rw-r--r--). Executable permission for .desktop files are only useful for launchers in your desktop area (the workspace), so they show their icon and allow double-click to start the application. For Dash, Launcher, Autostart and menus in general the executable bit is irrelevant.\n\nA: In KDE it's in \n    ~/.kde/Autostart\nThis has been depreciated, KDE Plasma now follows the XDG spec. System wide startup dir is found in /etc/xdg/autostart and user specific ones in ~/.config/autostart\nI have a script there which starts Krusader:\n #!/bin/bash\n krusader &\n\nDon't forget to make the scripts You'll put in Autostart - to be executable.\n", "Q: 11.04 will not run on Aspire One I'm trying to install 11.04 but after a while it will start showing a stream of random characters on screen, then get stuck and finally open BusyBox. If I type exit there I come up with a \"Panic occurred, switching back to text console\" error and from there the loading won't progress. What's wrong?\n\nA: Since your model isn't supported in the official list then I suggest you try an older version that is supported like 10.10 or 10.04 LTS. \nit would make it easier to help you more if we knew the exact model.\nhttps://help.ubuntu.com/community/AspireOne\nI would guess from your tips that your model is Aspire One 532h. \n\nA: We need a little more info, How far into the \"install\" are you getting?

I can address the printer in Ubuntu but selecting print does not produce a print. \nChecking the print que shows my job as 'processing'. I´m thinking it may be a firewall or permissions issue but not sure what settings to look out for. My machine is running Ubuntu 11.04 64bit and the other with printer attached is Windows Vista 32bit with file and printer sharing turned on and Norton 360.\nI´ve tried disabling the firewall with no effect.\nWhile browsing other posts I saw one that made mention of using Samba to link Linux and Windows for file and printer sharing. Software Center shows a SMB/CIFS client installed but I´m not sure how to configure it. Tried another Samba client with a GUI but it didn´t seem to make a difference (it did find the printer share and list it in it´s GUI).\nI opened a print window in the PDF Viewer which showed the printer status as unavailable.\nI contacted Canon asking them directly if they have an alternate driver for the printer for Linux. They said no, and the age of the printer puts it out of support of that kind.\nI found another printer that had a Linux driver for it (MP880) and attempted to install it to see what happened. The install failed (incorrect architecture). I believe it is due to the driver being 32bit and my OS being 64bit. I read a post about recompiling a 32bit driver into a 64bit one (however unstable) but I do not have that much experience to follow that path yet. \nSeems that despite the amount of time we have had 64bit processors and 64bit OS´ there is a complete lack of support for 64bit functions.

I'm a bit confused by the recent announcement (http://developer.ubuntu.com/2011/09/announcing-the-ubuntu-app-developer-site/) of the new \"App\" developer site. I've fallen out of Ubuntu development and now only follow news stories to gauge the direction of the OS, and hadn't realized this was coming down the pipe. Perhaps someone from the community could clear this up for me.\nI'm very familiar with Ubuntu, Linux, programming, and packaging, but I'm not sure what the conceptual and technical differences are between an Ubuntu app and a Debian package. I've looked a bit into the developer community documentation, but haven't found a straight answer. Can an Ubuntu app be considered a specially configured package that supports Ubuntu's app framework? And how flexible is that? Could I, for example, write an application in Qt and still wrap it in an app?\n(As an aside, I'm a little concerned Ubuntu is headed in this direction. I understand that Ubuntu should explore supporting multiple avenues of application development and distribution to stay relevant. But for a engineering user such as myself, this feels like cruft. These remarks are ignorant though. I shouldn't form a solid opinion until I know what's going on.)\n\nA: An Ubuntu \"app\" is just an application, just like GIMP, Firefox, or whatever. \nThey're still Debian packages, we just provide a tool called Quickly that gets people going with PyGTK and make it easy to package and submit to the software center.\nYou can still write your application in Qt, package it, and submit it to the Software Center, we just are trying to simplify connecting developers like you to make shipping your software to end users easier.\n\nA: Well, an application is provided as a package, but not all packages are applications. One or more fonts can be provided as packages, for instance. In other words, there is a conceptual difference between a package and an application, but no difference between an application and a package. \nYes, you can develop applications in any language and using any framework you like. Quickly provides a very easy starting point and the main recommendation is using Python and GTK, but there are also templates for Ruby, and other languages and templates for web development instead of desktop applications. Quickly is specifically designed not to limit the developers choice in languages, and (hopefully obviously) there is no lock-in to Ubuntu. You can also provide your own templates, if you application supports plugins, for instance. What Quickly does, is to relieve you of writing boring boilerplate code. \nTo publish applications using the MyApps portal, there are a few requirements, like your application must use XDG_USER_DIRS for its data and configs, it must be installable to /opt, etc. Other than that, there are no requirements. You can write your app in Java, Python, C*, Gambas or anything else that's supported and using any GUI toolkit you feel like. This makes sense as a primary goal of modern versions of Ubuntu is to unite Qt, GTK and others in order to provide a better user experience. \nI hope this clarifies a little bit and that you're less worried about the direction Ubuntu is evolving. :)\n", "Q: How can I install Glade 3.08?

It's important that one gets the IP address assignment method right. If there is a DHCP server on your local network, you should use it. To do so, delete the  \"address\", \"netmask\", \"gateway\", and \"broadcast\" lines.\nIf you're not connected to an \"administered\" local area network (and don't have a DHCP server), and want to assign the IP address parameters manually, change the first line to:\niface eth0 inet static\n\nand keep the  \"address\", \"netmask\", \"gateway\", and \"broadcast\" lines. See http://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc5735.txt for details about which IP addresses are available for use. The parameters you have look OK to me.\nRead \nman 5 interfaces\n\nsimply commenting everything out is not the best path to happiness. \n\nA: Seems like for me, the best solution for this problem was found at this linux site\nBasically, still calling /etc/init/failsafe.conf , but commenting out the two sleep calls that caused the delay. I don't really see why they were added, since my network is configured fine without the need for a delay.\n\nA: First off, this is a new behavior, documented in the 11.10 release notes, that I actually developed together with Scott Moser as an effort to make server boot more reliable.\nCommenting out lo will mean you have no local network capability, which will break some programs when they try to use the network. It will also cause your system to never boot because it is so critical. So leave these two lines:\nauto lo\niface lo inet loopback\n\nThe bits about eth0 meant that your machine was configured to wait for a dynamic address to be assigned to it before the network is considered UP. In pre-upstart versions of Ubuntu (8.10 and earlier), the system would have waited up to 60 seconds for this before continuing the boot. When upstart was added, this condition wasn't waited for anymore, because network interfaces that were not always expected to be plugged in are better managed by something like network-manager.\nSo, if you have a server, you probably want to wait for a dynamic address, otherwise the system will boot without all of its networks available (which it does if it takes more than 2 minutes to get an address). If you have a laptop that you don't always expect to be plugged in to eth0, then configure eth0 in network manager, and remove only those lines from /etc/network/interfaces, which should get rid of your boot delay.\nKeep in mind, there's a known bug with VMware and dbus that also causes this message.\n\nA: I use  \neth0 inet dhcp\n\nI don't see the point of waiting when there is no link (the cable is missing)\nThere is no way dhcp can get the address if there is no media.\nThis is a bug\n\nA: I recently just had this same problem. I tried to go in and comment out the sleep time in /etc/init/failsafe.conf file and ended up with the system just continuously trying to boot. I fixed this error by booting into safe mode and droping into a root shell and doing the following so that I had rw privleges: \nmount -o remount,rw / \n\nI then issued the following command which brought up the file so that I could edit it back to it's orginal state:\nsudo nano /etc/init/failsafe.conf \n\nSave and exit, then reboot the system.\n\nA: Use allow-hotplug instead of auto in the /etc/network/interfaces file, e.g., allow-hotplug enp0s25 then iface enp0s25 inet dhcp. This tells the server to not wait for the interface to light up with a dhcp answer. - -\n Dr. Zim's comment. \n", "Q: Is Cairo dock 2.4 fully compatible with Intel i965?

You can hunt down each of these programs and check if it is possible to configure them to use some other folder instead, but this is most likely a tedious task. \nWhat you can do however is to mount the ntfs partition inside your home folder or hardlink any subfolder of it to have every music, video and document in it and happily share it with windows.\nYour fstab for example may look like this (assuming Windows 7)\n/dev/sda7 /media/seven ntfs-3g utf8,umask=000,uid=1000,gid=1000 0 0\n/media/seven/users/throoze/Music /home/throoze/Music none rw,bind 0 0\n\nThis way, you get rid of a lot of cruft which isn't any good and is easily tampered in each other system.\nNote that the last '1' in your fstab should be substituted with '0', since fsck.ntfs is mostly useless.\n", "Q: Download 64bit packages in a 32bit system I need to download some packages to install in my other machine which doesn't have internet access, and has a 64-bit architecture.\nSince this machine which has internet connection is 32-bit, it only downloads 32-bit packages with apt-get. \nI want to know if it is possible to: \n\n\n*\n\n*download 64 bit packages; \n\n*download those which are already present.\n\n\nAlternatively, is it possible to get the url for these packages in a automatic way?\n\nA: You can use aptitude (to be installed):\nsudo aptitude -o APT::Architecture=\"amd64\" update\naptitude -o APT::Architecture=\"amd64\" download package-name\n\n(after that, remember to do an apt-get update without -o option, to restore correct i386 information).\nIt is also possible to show packages URLs with\napt-get --print-uris install package-name\n\nbut this only works for non inistalled packages.

It's easy to do. Your filesystems are defined in /etc/fstab.

Do not get confused by the amd word in amd64, it's just a marketing name that refers to the same architecture: 64-bit (well, I may not be fully technically correct here, but you can expect an amd64 Ubuntu image to run on Intel machines). i386 is used for 32-bit  stuff.

Because I write many document with office word 2007 + mathtype.\nI'm not request for libreoffice can edit mathtype's equations, but I want to know libreoffice can open all the office word 2007 documents or not?\n\nA: libreoffice and openoffice are just clones separated due to policy reasons. But as far as word 07 is concerned, LO or OO may sometimes may not be so faithful in reproducing the exact same effect as in Word 07.\nSome formatting mismatch you can always expect.\n\nA: Yes, as others have stated, you can open Word 2007 documents with LibreOffice on Ubuntu. No one addressed MathType equations though, so let me mention that...\nYou already realize you can't edit MathType equations on Ubuntu, so as you stated, you don't expect to. The best experience when going from Word 2007 to LibreOffice on Ubuntu though, is for the Word document to be in .doc format -- not .docx. The main differences between the 2 when they're open in LibreOffice are fonts and alignment of the MathType equations.\nWhen you save as .doc and open in LibreOffice, the fonts should be the same as what you used on Windows (assuming, of course, these fonts are present in Ubuntu). The equations should have roughly the same vertical alignment with surrounding text as they did in Word. With .docx, the fonts may be substituted, and the equations will be shifted up so the bottom of the equation is aligned with the baseline of the text.\nThere may also be an issue with the fonts used in the MathType equations. If some of the symbols don't show up, there are two things to check. First, check that the font MT Extra is installed in Ubuntu. If it is, make sure it's not a version that's dated earlier than 2001. If it's an old version, delete it and replace it with the one from your Windows installation of MathType. The second thing to check is whether you've installed the Ubuntu Restricted Extras, available from the Software Center. This includes additional Microsoft fonts.\n\nA: Well, to make sure that you can use Libre Office without any problems you can easy test for it if it will work without any issues (and maybe start moving out from MS Office in to LibreOffice) using the portable version of LibreOffice.\nNo need for install, if it doesn't work just delete it and you are good.\nYou can get the portable version of LibreOffice here: http://www.libreoffice.org/download/portable/\nHave a look and gl ;)\n", "Q: What's the best way to pause my work in Virtualbox with Ubuntu as a guest? Host OS: Windows 7 Guest OS: Ubuntu 11.04\nSay if I won't need to work on the guest OS for 1 hour, while having a lot of programs running and don't want to close them. What is the best way to pause my work on the guest OS? Ubuntu has suspend and hibernate. I found that hibernate won't work as it always fails to boot up after hibernate. For suspend, should I couple it with Virtualbox pause to release the host OS resources. Would this cause any issue once resume the work? Since I found sometimes the guest OS becomes slower resume from pause VM.\n\nA: Create a script called 90_virtualbox in /etc/pm/sleep.d:\n#!/bin/sh\n#\n# 90virtualbox: scan for active virtual machines and pause them on host suspend\n\nVBoxManage list runningvms | while read line; do VBoxManage controlvm \"$(expr match \"$line\" '\"\\(.*\\)\"')\" pause; done\n\n\nA: For Virtual Box it is not recommended to use the power saving features of the guest OS as this will all be handled by the host. Therefore first thing when having installed my guest OS I disable this (including disabling the screen saver).\nThe appropriate way to save a virtual machines state (and resume later) is to coose Save the machine state when closing the machine from virtual box manager (here depicted for Windows XP).\n\nThis will free all ressources from the virtual machine. Next time we start the machine we will resume exactly at the same state where we saved it (like in suspend/hibernate from a real machine).\nFrom command line this can also be done by\nVBoxManage controlvm <name_of_machine>  savestate\n\n\nNote on security: Mind that resuming from a saved state does not ask for authentication for the guest OS. In case we work with confidential data we therefore need to log out (or switch user) from the guest OS before saving.\n\nA: Full agree :)\nso in conclusion, we can use the sleep option on the host and GO ^^\nHowever, carreful if we hadn't saved the vm's status in case of issue with the wake up of the host\nBecause of our exchanges and thanks to Bruno I will now click on the host sleep mode with no more worry :)\nHave a nice week-end, Christophe FR\nPS:I update this post to tell to Bruno that host and guest additions are updated.\n\nA: Did you install Vbox additions correctly on the guest OS?\nI don't see a problem with of the options here. If you can make Ubuntu hibernate it would be great but a suspend + pause option will work the same.\nHibernation can be simply described as: all content in memory save in disk file which is read again on boot up. (Memory>temp file in disk>power off:::power on>read temp file to memory> restore session>read new times, dates of other hardware info that might have changed in the meanwhile>ready)\nSuspend can be simply described as: all content of memory will not be touched, most of your hardware will be powered down, once you start up again the memory session will be restored. (memory stays the same, static>most hardware powers off, memory is not turned off:::power back on>restore session>read new times, dates of other hardware info that might have changed in the meanwhile>ready)\nSo, in the end, its the same if you hibernate or suspend + pause you guest OS. The results should be the same.\nWork on the hibernation part in my opinion, saves an extra \"pause\" click.\n", "Q: Which sound profile will allow me to simultaneously hear and record system audio + microphone input?

Under the \"Output\" tab I selected internal audio as the output. When I recorded a screencast in Tibesti and played it back, I could hear myself and the system sounds. Unfortunately, I couldn't hear the system sounds while recording, which means screencasting a Skype call couldn't work.\nThe internal audio profiles are: Analog Stereo Duplex, Analog Stereo Output, Digital Stereo (IEC958) Output + Analog Stereo Input, Digital Stereo Duplex (IEC958), Digital Stereo (HDMI) Output + Analog Stereo Input, Digital Stereo (HDMI) Output, Analog Stereo Input, Off.\nThe headset audio profiles are: Analog Stereo Duplex, Analog Stereo Output, Analog Stereo Input, Off.\nWhich profile combination and input/output selection will allow me to simultaneously hear and record system audio + microphone input?\n\nA: No sound profile selection will achieve the results you are looking for.

Both are based on pure text files, but they are very different: e.g. Python code needs to be aligned to be able to see the structure of the code (loops, functions, ...). Therefore a Monospace font is a good thing. For writing a Latex document, I mainly need readability.

On my system, analog output works, but the volume of the headphone output is very low. Internal speakers work well, and the volume level is reasonable. However, even at 150%, the volume of headphone output is barely audible (alsamixer command line utility also at full volume).\nIs there a way to set a constant boost or pedestal to the headphone output? What I mean is, applying a strengthening effect to the baseline to which the sound levels in the volume mixer are compared. \nThere seem to be some reports relating to this on Launchpad - does anyone know of a workaround or solution?\nEdit: I forgot to mention that sometimes, when the speakers are enabled (the output is set to \"Analog Output\"), there is also sound from the headphone output - in these cases, the volume level is a-ok in the headphones as well.

I'm running a Dell XPS L502X, one of those hybrid graphics models that don't yet \"just work\" on Linux :( When I installed Ubuntu (Natty) I just went ahead and accepted whatever options I was given, including installing the current NVidia drivers.\nAdditional Drivers reports the driver as the current version, recommended, required for Unity, activated, but not currently in use. However, I can't actually run Unity, so I'm currently running with Unity 2D. Ubuntu has not detected the driver as being obsolete, but I get the following when running /usr/lib/nux/unity_support_test -p :\n\nXlib:  extension \"GLX\" missing on display \":0\".\nXlib:  extension \"GLX\" missing on display \":0\".\nXlib:  extension \"GLX\" missing on display \":0\".\nError: unable to create the OpenGL context\n\nWhen I start the \"NVIDIA X Server Settings\" application, I get the following message: \"You do not appear to be using the NVIDIA X driver. Please edit your X configuration file (just run nvidia-xconfig as root, and restart the X server.\"\nI've since been told that on these models specifically you shouldn't install or activate the NVidia driver.

You cannot use the nvidia card directly (as you may already have noticed) because your notebook is an Optimus laptop (see also Is a NVIDIA GeForce with Optimus Technology supported by Ubuntu? on that).\nIf you do not run programs that heavily rely on the graphics card, just stick to the Intel iGPU to save power as well. As a developer of Bumblebee, I can tell that work is in progress to get automatic power management working which would disable the nvidia card to save even more power. However, this feature is not mature yet so I'd not recommend it to regular or power users for the reason that you'll need some understanding of ACPI.\n\nA: I actually installed switcheroo on my ASUS and wrote a /etc/init.d script (with start, stop, status and help options) which I have symlinked as S--- or K--- from the different\n/etc/rcX.d directories. You need to load the nouveau drivers before disabling the NVIDIA and you need to reenable the NVIDIA before unloading the nouveau drivers in order to have a seemless boot/shutdown process. And for the rest, I do have the same requirements as you and the IntelHD Ironlake I have is running my compiz+GNOME2 environment quite well. I'm still on 10.10, because I didn't get to love Unity enough ;-) \n\nA: To run Unity like the other kids you might have to disable the nvidia card in the bios (if possible). This will also save battery life. If you cannot disable nvidia in bios, you might want to install bumblebee anyway because it will help you to run 3D graphics with the intel card too. \n", "Q: How to access a port on a remote server using SSH? I have a service running on a certain port at the server. What I want to do is, access the server using SSH and use a local (client-side) program to access the server's port.

Something different with the same effect is also fine.\n\nA: i8kutils works for controlling the fan of my Dell Vostro 3350 laptop.\n\n# For Dell laptop only:\n$ sudo apt-get install i8kutils \n$ i8kfan 1 2 # Set the left-fan at low speed(1); the right one at high speed(2).\n\n\nA: Ok, this might not be the answer you are looking for, but my overheating problems were solved, when removed the dust by putting a vacuum cleaner on the ventilation inlets. If you experience overheating at low cpu-frequencies, this might be worth a try. Be aware that maybe small parts may get sucked in. If you are lucky this method might solve you overheating problems. \n\nA: I have a Dell Latitude e4200 and the following worked for me because the BIOS was overriding i8kfan setting. My computer's initial temperature was 105F degrees and about 10 mins after using these steps (fan setting = 2) the CPU/Core temps dropped to 96F degrees. This procedure had already been posted by someone:\nStep 1. Download and install i8ktutils:\n# sudo apt-get install i8kutils\n\nStep 2. Override the BIOS to keep it from interrupting custom fan settings. Download the source code and compile a program (SMM) to do this:\n# sudo apt-get build-dep i8kutils\n\nthen:\n# apt-get source i8kutils\n\nStep 3. Extract the source code and cd into the directory:\n# tar xvf i8kutils_1.33.tar.gz\n\nthen:\n# cd i8kutils-1.33/\n\nStep 4. Compile SMM\nFor 32-bit systems:\n\n# make SMM\n\n(Output: # gcc -g -O2 -Wall -I. -o smm smm.c.)\n\nFor 64-bit systems\n\n# make SMM:\n\n(Output: # gcc -g -O2 -Wall -I. -o smm -m32 smm.c)\n\nStep 5. Execute SMM with parameters:\n# sudo ./smm 30a3\n\nStep 6. Set the fan speeds:\n# i8kfan 2 2 (Listen as this will set fans to maximum speed)\n\n# i8kfan 1 1 (This will set fans to slow speed)\n\nNow BIOS fan control should not override fan settings. This setting will remain even if the system is rebooted.  To give control back to BIOS for some reason do the following procedure:\n# sudo ./smm 31a3.\n\nThere is also a way to check the temp by using lm_sensors:\nhttp://www.cyberciti.biz/faq/howto-linux-get-sensors-information/\n\n\nA: You'll most likely be able to solve your problem with something else overriding your i8kctl fan commands by the method given in this answer. For completeness, I'll include some general notes on fan control on Dell laptops, and full instructions for i8kutils.\nWhat probably won't work\nTwo common and straight-forward means of controlling the fan on laptops are through ACPI and through PWM pins, however, unfortunately:\n\n*\n\n*Dell laptops lacks ACPI fan control capability (*1)\n\n*\n\n*as a consequence, trying with ACPI boot parameters and the like will fail\n\n\n\n*Dell Latitude laptops, as far as I know, lack pwm controllable fans (*2)\n\n*\n\n*as a consequence, the fancontrol/pwmconfig program won't work\n\n\n\nUse i8kutils\nHowever, there's a package called i8kutils that is written to control the fan on Dell Inspiron laptops through SMM BIOS. Several users report success on their Dell Laitude laptops as well (I'm one of them, on a Dell Latitude E7440) - however, a trick is often needed to get rid of interfering BIOS fan control. You suffer from that as well according to a previous comment.\nInstall i8kutils:\n$ sudo apt-get install i8kutils\n\nTry it:\n$ i8kfan 2 2     # set to max speed\n$ i8kfan 0 0     # set to 0 speed\n\n...and listen to see if it works.\nDisable BIOS fan control\nIf it works, but somewthing else is fighting back on the setted speed (reported by many users on Dell Latitude laptops), this is due to scheduled SMM sessions setting the fan speed back. Luckily there is a way to disable BIOS fan control by writing to SMM registers.\nWarning: see the warning in top of smm.c. This method will write to SMM registers. However, I've seen no user reports on this causing trouble. Also, all reports on trying this have indicated success in disabling the BIOS fan control.\ni8kutils includes the source of a program smm but the i8kutils package does not include the compiled binary. What we'll do is to download the source code of i8kutils, compile the program smm, and run it with an apropriate argument to disable BIOS fan control by writing to SMM registers.\nDownload packages needed for building:\n$ sudo apt-get build-dep i8kutils\n\nDownload i8kutils source code, extract and enter directory (exact names depending on i8k version):\n$ apt-get source i8kutils\n$ tar xvf i8kutils_1.33.tar.gz\n$ cd i8kutils-1.33/\n\nCompile smm:\n\n*\n\n*If on a 32-bit system:\n $ make\n\n(Above will execute gcc -g -O2 -Wall -I. -o smm smm.c.)\n\n\n*If on a 64-bit system:\n $ gcc -g -O2 -Wall -I. -o smm -m32 smm.c\n\nRun smm with argument 30a3 to disable SMM fan control:\n$ sudo ./smm 30a3\n\nNow, BIOS fan control should be disabled. Try by setting speeds with i8kctl, listen for the fan and make sure the speed persists.\nNote: This is a setting that will persist reboots and power-off's. BIOS fan control can be enabled again with $ sudo ./smm 31a3.\n\n*1: I've seen an official source on this, can't find it right now. If you want to verify that your hardware lacks it, follow instructions here: https://wiki.ubuntu.com/DebuggingACPI\n*2: for verifying this, run pwmconfig: sudo apt-get install fancontrol, sudo pwm-config will tell if a pwm-capable fan is present or not\nNote about smm\nsmm is no longer included in latest i8kutils. If your distribution already upgraded to the latest version, you'll have to fetch an older version manually. The version 1.41 contains smm, while 1.43 no longer contains it.\nAs of 1.42, smm is provided as a kernel module only.\nYou can obtain 1.41 on i8kutils launchpad page.\n\nA: The package lm-sensors  might be what you are looking for.\nAnd as you suggested fancontrol .\nBe sure that all the fans that you are trying to control via software have the 4 pin connector.\n\"A PWM capable fan is usally connected to a 4-pin connector (pinout: Ground, +12V, sense, control).\"source\nWhen I run pwmconfig which is a part of fancontrol I get \n/usr/sbin/pwmconfig: There are no pwm-capable sensor modules installed\nIt will guide you if you have compatible hardware.\nHere are some scripts to use in conjunction with that generated config file.\nI assume that you could set a higher value here.\nlabel fan1 \"Side Fan\"\nset fan1_min 1000\nlabel fan2 \"PSU Fan\"\nset fan2_min 1000\nlabel fan5 \"CPU Fan\"\nset fan5_min 1000\n\nBut as I said, I can't test this myself, since my hardware don't support it, I can control my fans from the bios, but it's a grade of 3. I use it for keeping my fan's slow and silent.\n", "Q: Filezilla uploads at 80KB/Sec Max Am trying to upload files with Filezilla to my server and the upload is somehow limited to 80KiB. The server can take up to 4MiB in upload and my connection has a 512KiB upload.\nWhat should I check to see what the problem is.\n\nA: There are a few things that could be limiting your speed:\n\n\n*\n\n*The receiving server: some servers limit up/download speeds depending on the protocol used (eg: I used to have a web hosting server that throttled HTTP downloads to 40 KB/s, but SCP worked full speed)\n\n*Your ISP (ie: your upstream speed limit): if this is the case the only choice is to upgrade\n\n*Your client (FileZilla): if you can upload with better speeds to the same server using the same protocol with a different client, it might be a setting on your client.\n\nA: use speedtest.net to check your real upload and download speed.\nusually the upload speed is half the download speed.\nEdit: You may also check your speed limit settings for FileZilla which is located under Edit > Settings... > Transfers > Speed Limits.\n\nA: Are you sure you are not confusing KiB with KB or something:\n512KiB line is max: ((512*1000)/8)/1024=62.500KB max, don't know were you had your 80KB from but not from a 512KiB line I think.\n", "Q: Configuring HDMI Audio via command line I'm looking for a way to configure HDMI audio output via the command line using pulseaudio. I was able to get it running by using pavucontrol and changing it in the configuration tab, but I need a way to automate the process. I haven't been able to find any documentation at all so far. The system is a lucid install.\nEdit: From what I've found, I can use pacmd set-card-profile to do this. However, whenever I try, I get an error like the following (using the default profiles as defined in /usr/share/pulseaudio/alsa-mixer/profile-sets/default.conf)\n# pacmd set-card-profile 0 hdmi-stereo\nWelcome to PulseAudio!

Use \"help\" for usage information.\n>>> Failed to set card profile to 'analog-stereo'.\n\nWhy can't I change these from command line when pavucontrol works to change them?\n\nA: I was using the tool wrong. The correct way to do it was pactl set-card-profile 0 output:hdmi-audio. You can get a list of avilable profile names by running pacmd list-cards.\n\nA: Open a terminal and type:\nsudo apt-get install alsamixergui\n\nThen run it (Alt+F2 or press super key):\nalsamixergui\n\nA window will open for sound cofiguration...\n\nA: I found a simpler way to do this - on the Hardware tab of the System Settings Sound control, right-click on the profile drop down and select \nDigital Stereo (HDMI) Output + Analog Stereo input from the list.\n", "Q: Can you please add other folders back to sync options back to Ubuntu One in Windows?

I installed Ubuntu on to a HP desktop, and after the HP splash screen and where the GRUB screen should be is nothing but a blank screen with my monitors screen resolution information. After waiting a little bit it will boot to Ubuntu.\nHowever, I can boot into Windows by pressing the down arrow (I think I press it about 6 times to be sure) after the HP splash screen and during the blank screen with the monitor information. That is were GRUB should have been shown, and that is where I blindly select Windows (not really an issue for me because rarely ever need Windows and I mean rarely).\nPerhaps this could be the same issue you have run into as well, and maybe this might solve your problem about being able to boot into Windows.\n\nA: You should check the GRUB2 configuration. For an easy GUI, install package grub-customizer and open it (will ask admin access). Then:\n\n\n*\n\n*Verify that os-prober is checked, that is the GRUB2 component that find other OS\n\n*click Preferences and verify that \"Show menu\" is checked and that wait time is enough to see it.\n\n\nFor info: Grub-Customizer launchpad page\n", "Q: change to Ubuntu Server or stay with Ubuntu I have an Ubuntu PC (10.04) which I plan to use as a home server.  It's main use will be NAS and media server with MediaTomb.\nShould I:\n\n\n*\n\n*backup and reformat PC, and install Ubuntu Server.\n\n*leave it how it is, and just install necessary software.\n\n\nI've been using this PC as my main computer for three years+ now, so there is a lot installed.  But I don't have much time to properly do option 1.\n\nA: One way to remove a large amount of the desktop-type stuff that you have installed is to apt-get remove ubuntu-desktop.  That should pull out virtually every gui app and library you have installed.  Call it option 1.5.\n\nA: As you are talking about an \"home\" server, I think you prefer easiness vs performance, and NAS and media server do not use so high resources. \nSo, I would choose Option 2, this will save you time and give you a more user-friendly system with graphical access, if you need.\nThe only downside is that the graphical components will take some RAM, but I think you have enough for your use.\n\nA: Performance wise, your Ubuntu \"non-server\" will run as a home server good enough without having to install or configure it, or even format it to put Ubuntu server on it.\nI already did this 3 times, one in my own home, the other at a lan party place I go every so often and in my boss place.\nThere are little differences in performance between the server and desktop that you will notice in a lan environment.\nMy suggestion to save you time, money, patience is to just install the needed packages using the gui since it won't suck that much resources from the server. Which brings me to another point. Having or not having a gui will not have a big impact on your server (Specially for your home server). You will loose some memory which for a common 2GB or more ram PC is not even worth mentioning. It will not create problems and at the end, you will have a server that you can GUI manage.\nNow, in what case-scenarios I would HAVE TO install the server version.\nWell if you add to your question something like \"I have a 32GB RAM server with 4 SSD drives and etc.. etc.. etc..\". That puppy should better be a server version than a desktop version to use better the additional memory, cpu, drives, resources in general available.\nAm assuming since you have used your PC for that much time is a common 4GB or less RAM PC with a common CPU and a normal hard drive. Just install the additional packages, don't give yourself so much trouble and time and enjoy your new Home brew server in which you can provide apart from the NAS and connection you want mentioned there many more server options that are generally available in the desktop (Like Web Cache with SQUID to speed up the internet for your family and network users, video sharing like VLC and more, folder sharing, printer sharing, etc..).\n\nA: I would go for option 1 since you won't be using it anymore for general purposes but only as a server. It really depends on how organized and clean you want your PC to be, since I'm really picky about it I would choose option 1, but if you don't really care you should not waste time, however you should check if it will increase performance and if it will then option 1 is the only option for this.\n", "Q: How do I remove \"Ubuntu\" in the bios boot menu? (UEFI) See this ubuntu appears in BIOS menu (UEFI)\nI have this on my Lenovo s205 too. \nIs there some way to remove \"ubuntu\" from the menu?

I was trying to fix a friend's laptop where he has deleted all Ubuntu partitions from the dual boot option thinking that's the standard way to wipe Ubuntu. Normally the answer mentioned by @kamal works as mentioned above. But in my case, this time it was a bit different/weird.\nThere was no Ubuntu directory inside the folder named EFI. I saw four EFI files inside the EFI folder. All of them were representing CPU architecture, and all looked like Windows EFI files. I didn't want to risk and delete the wrong EFI file.\nUsually, the Ubuntu EFI file looks like this: elilo.efi.\nBut there was no such EFI file in my case nor the directory with a name of a particular distribution.\nI wish I knew this command before, it would have a huge amount of time.

Please check that you chose port 9050 in your Firefox settings. The 514 error code comes when you choose 9051. This port is called control port and works only with some form of authentication. However a better alternative is to use Polipo or Privoxy. If you also install them you have to choose port 8123 for Polipo and 8118 for Privoxy. After entering those data you should visit the check page.

Now you should be able to load and use the freshly compiled b43 module:\n$ sudo modprobe b43\n\nYou might want to add b43 to the list of modules which are loaded on startup (at the moment, the module is not automatically loaded). For Ubuntu, add this line at the end of the file :\nsudo nano /etc/modules\n\n...\nb43\n...\nThe driver does not play nice with suspend and hibernate.

Bcma causes problem with the 3.0.0 kernel. You might just have to  blacklist the modules 'b43, ssb, bcma' then do  a depmod -a and modprobe wl then another depmod -a or reinstall the package and reboot. I hope this helps.  \n\nA: I don't know why exact replica of the article get 2 votes. It's useless. I finally get it working only by unloading ssb and bcma like Rock suggested.\n", "Q: How do I make usb sticks not ever use any write cache? That is, I want to be able to pluck them out anytime without worrying if data will be lost. I want every write to actually be written immediately.\n\nA: Mount them with the flush option.  This is done by default in Ubuntu.\n\nA: The 'flush' option is a middle-ground option.  It will improve your chances over a default mount, however, there is still some caching.  AFAIK, it is meant to provide a balance for flash drives.  \nIf you want to go even farther, use the options 'sync' and 'dirsync'.  These have drawbacks, though.  You may take a huge performance hit since flash drives have to erase an unused block and then write that entire block with the old block's data and changes.  This erase block size is hardware dependant and often much larger than the io block size.  You could end up in a situation where the drive has to write 4MB just to replace one bit.\nNot only can synchronous io tank performance, but the huge increase in block erase/write cycles will drastically reduce the life of your drive.\nNothing is going to protect you from data loss within a file that was open by an application and in an inconsistent state, ie., not closed, when you pull the drive, either. \nFinally, the drive may have cache in hardware.  Setting it to write-through may also be hardware dependent.  I wouldn't be surprised if a sizable number of usb flash drives have cache and don't even report it to Linux.\nOne non-cache related option that increases write speed is 'discard'.  This causes flash drives which support it to immediately erase or 'trim' blocks which are no longer used by a file or the filesystem once they are freed.  Since you want to get data out of cache quickly, this will ensure you have plenty of erased blocks ready for writes, speeding io when you need it.  \nCheers,\nJon\n", "Q: Sending all outgoing TCP packets through Tor I want to make all outgoing TCP packets on my Ubuntu 10.04 computer anonymous.

I was wondering if there is a way to remote desktop from my mac to Ubuntu 11.04 without logging in first? My ubuntu is set up as my media server, and occasionally I need to screen share. So far I am able to do it successfully from Apple Screen share IF my ubuntu user is logged in. However, if ubuntu is at the screen prompting username and password to login, screen share will not connect. I am able to login via terminal after I ssh, but it wont work unless the user is actually logged in. Any help would be appreciated, its annoying to keep connecting a monitor just to log in.\n\nA: I would probably install X2Go if what you really want is a remote desktop solution. This is a terminal server that will enable you to log onto the system whether or not the user is logged in. You will also be able to run a single application from the other machine. And it's much faster than VNC. http://www.x2go.org. \nHowever, if your Ubuntu machine has a screen and you just want to control it using a laptop as a mouse and keyboard for it, then you want to use Synergy. This is available for Ubuntu, Windows and OS X and then the other computer simply acts as an external screen to the laptop. \n\nA: You need to make sure vino is loaded at startup, not just when your user logs in.

I used to edit the startup script for the GDM (/etc/gdm/Init/Default) to permanently change my display resolution. \nHow can I do this with LigthDM in Ubuntu Oneiric?\n\nA: Modify /etc/lightdm/lightdm.conf to add the following options:\ndisplay-setup-script > calls your mycustomloginvideo.sh before the login screen appears\nsession-setup-script > calls your mycustomdesktopvideo.sh before the user desktop session starts\n[SeatDefaults]\ngreeter-session=unity-greeter\nuser-session=ubuntu\n# for your login screen, e.g. LightDM (Ubuntu 11.10) or GDM (11.04 or earlier)\ndisplay-setup-script=/usr/share/mycustomloginvideo.sh\n# for your desktop session\nsession-setup-script=/usr/share/mycustomdesktopvideo.sh\n\nYou may have \"arandr\" GUI tool generate the above sh script, picking parameters from your current session's X configuration.\nMake sure that your shell script is executable:\nchmod a+x /usr/share/mycustom*video.sh\n\nand you can test that it works (i.e. that you don't have any typos or configuration errors in your xrandr command) just by running it in a terminal:\n/usr/share/mycustomdesktopvideo.sh\n\nIf the login script doesn't work for any reason, your machine might not complete the boot process to the login screen. If the desktop script fails, you might not get a desktop after logging in.

I found this post on the ArchWiki https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Xorg which I adapted to my needs.\nFirst create a file here: /etc/X11/xorg.conf.d/10-monitor.conf\nThen add the appropriate X details for your display here is how mine looked:\nSection \"ServerLayout\"\nIdentifier     \"DualSreen\"\nScreen       0 \"Screen0\"\nScreen       1 \"Screen1\" RightOf \"Screen0\" #Screen1 at the right of Screen0\n#Option         \"Xinerama\" \"1\" #To move windows between screens\nEndSection\n\nSection \"Monitor\"\nIdentifier     \"LVDS1\"\nOption         \"ignore\" \"true\"\nEndSection\n\nSection \"Monitor\"\nIdentifier     \"VGA1\"\nOption         \"Enable\" \"true\"\nModeline \"1440x900_60.00\"  106.47  1440 1520 1672 1904  900 901 904 932  -HSync +Vsync\nEndSection\n\nSection \"Device\"\nIdentifier     \"Device0\"\nDriver         \"intel\"\nScreen         0\nEndSection\n\nSection \"Device\"\nIdentifier     \"Device1\"\nDriver         \"intel\"\nScreen         1\nEndSection\n\nSection \"Screen\"\nIdentifier     \"Screen0\"\nDevice         \"Device0\"\nMonitor        \"VGA1\"\nDefaultDepth    24\nOption         \"TwinView\" \"0\"\nSubSection \"Display\"\n    Depth          24\n    Modes          \"1440x900_60.00\"\nEndSubSection\nEndSection\n\nSection \"Screen\"\nIdentifier     \"Screen1\"\nDevice         \"Device1\"\nMonitor        \"LVDS1\"\nDefaultDepth   24\nOption         \"TwinView\" \"0\"\nSubSection \"Display\"\n    Depth          24\nEndSubSection\nEndSection\n\nThe important bits to add are under the appropriate Section \"Monitor\" include the appropriate Modeline that you found while using gtf 1440 900 60.00 and then under the corresponding Section \"Screen\" including the correct Modes.\nYou'll notice that what I was trying to do was not only to set the VGA1 connection to a suitable resolution but also tell it not to use my LVDS1 output. Obviously you will need to tweak yours appropriately to match the right number of outputs and the right Device, Screen and Display sections for your setup. \nSorry for the epic post, I have been tweaking xorg.conf files for some time now with the Hannspree display I've been using and the old xorg.conf setups that I used pre 11.10 just don't work properly any more this is the only solution I've found that works.\nGood Luck!\n\nA: I've had a similar problem with my laptop as above, and I wanted to add something to the conversation.  If you don't care about the login resolution (I don't), but want the actual workspace to be the right resolution, you can add your monitor information to LightDM but not turn on full resolution until you login.\nI just added the following script for my monitor in a file: lighdmxrandr\nxrandr --newmode \"1440x900_60.00\"  106.50  1440 1528 1672 1904  900 903 909 934 -hsync +vsync\nxrandr --addmode VGA1 1440x900_60.00\n\nthen I call it in /etc/lightdm/lightdm.conf\ndisplay-setup-script=/usr/bin/lightdmxrandr\n\nOnce I login I can setup my monitor in Displays and it works, even after I re-log (used to give me a big ugly error).\n\nA: As an enhancement for Jon Roberts answer, let me specify that arandr does not include in its sh script generation all parameters working in the current session. Primary monitor (in case you are using a dual monitor configuration), refresh rate and gamma settings for each monitor are not included, for example. My session script looks like that:\n#!/bin/sh\nxrandr --output LVDS --mode 1366x768 --pos 1600x432 --rotate normal --output HDMI-0 --off --output DVI-0 --off --output VGA-1 --mode 1600x1200 --rate 85 --pos 0x0 --rotate normal --primary\nxrandr --output VGA-1 --gamma 0.8:0.7:0.55 \n\nI manually added --rate and --primary options in the first line and then added manually a second line with the gamma correction because apparently xrandr gamma settings are lost whenever you switch a monitor to primary.\nI do not know if this particular behavior with the gamma settings when making a monitor primary is intended or is a bug.\nMoreover the session shell script is not called by lightdm but as a startup application, because it seems that lightdm calls the script before things are ready for xrandr and weird things happen. \n\nA: I had the problem of wanting an extended display on my new LXDE box, (not a dual clone), found the correct command, but couldn't make it permanent.\nxrandr --output VGA-0 --right-of DVI-0\n\nThe above methods all seemed too hard/not the right way to do it.\nI eventually found this:\nhttp://www.sudo-juice.com/change-lxde-screen-resolution-ubuntu-lubuntu/\nThat worked a treat, but I used gedit instead:\ngksu gedit /etc/xdg/lxsession/LXDE/autostart\n\nThen added the line at the end with an @ symbol at the start:\n@xrandr --output VGA-0 --right-of DVI-0\n\nHope that helps and thank you to sudo-juice.\nPS Note the double - in the xrandr command -- (didn't show up too clearly on my screen).\n\nA: Create a new document and name it e.g. /home/yourusername/yourscriptname.sh\nType in \n#!/bin/bash\nxrandr --newmode \"1600x900_60.00\"  118.25  1600 1696 1856 2112  900 903 908 934 -hsync +vsync\nxrandr --addmode VGA1 1600x900_60.00\nxrandr --output VGA1 --mode 1600x900_60.00\nunity --replace\n\nand save it in your home folder (this sets the resolution to 1600x900)\nOpen Startup Applications (or run gnome-session-properties) and click \"ADD\". Give a name and type in the command line:\nbash /home/yourusername/yourscriptname.sh\n\nSave it, and now the script will be ran now every you login, so you will need to logout first for it to take effect. Running the command (e.g. bash /home/yourusername/yourscriptname.sh) in a terminal would also be a good idea to check whether the script works.\n\nA: I think you can add the display modes to /etc/X11/xorg.conf.\nIf you don't have a xorg.conf, then you can use the following as a basis.

If you install it and the rygel-gst-launch plugin, you can configure it to serve arbitrary streams.\nIn the ~/.config/rygel.conf file, you'd need to include something like:\n[GstLaunch]\nenabled=true\nlaunch-items=webcam\nwebcam-title=Web Camera\nwebcam-mime=video/mpeg\nwebcam-launch=souphttpsrc location=http://url-to-webcam-stream\n\nDepending on the details of your webcam, you might need a different -mime and -launch lines.  The launch line is a GStreamer pipeline description, as you might pass to gst-launch-0.10 (minus the parts used to display/play the stream).\n\nA: I think you can do that with VLC, play around with the inputs and outputs, activate streaming and that should set you up.

I did a fresh installation with the formatting of my home partition (usually I do that way). The only one thing what I care about it's my mails (Evolution). \nUsually, I make a copy of .local/share/evolution/ directory, and then after installation just copies it into the same directory - it was absolutely enough for me before (I did it at least 4 times). \nBut this time I've got an error from Evolution - Unable to retrieve message\nAs far as I understood Gnome 3 had changed the structure of Nautilus and moved Evolution contents into another place :(\nIs there any chance to get my emails back into Evolution somehow?\nI would be very appreciated for help \n\nEDIT: Some additional info to my question - I have Hotmail account, so the messages retrieve by Evolution directly from MSN server (POP), and I don't leave the copies of the emails on the server.

You could try\nsudo chown -R justas:justas /home/justas/.local\n\nto change ownership of that whole subtree back to you.

We run a custom version of Ubuntu 10.04 at work and we've been testing some software that uses webcams recently, which 90% of the time works great but we've had a crash event on two separate pieces of hardware with quite different configurations which basically disables the in-built webcam completely.\nI've run through checking lsmod, lsusb, dmesg to see if the device or module appears at all (it doesn't), the block reference in /dev disappears completely and for all intensive purposes the webcam is gone. We then ran through a series of tests culminating in a fresh install of Ubuntu 10.04 LTS with no tweaks which once again couldn't find the webcam, the only way we could get it to appear was to install XP, autodetect it, then swap back into Ubuntu which would then acknowledge it. \nMy initial thoughts run to something to do with power control (I used to have an Aspire One, and if you used the Wifi power off switch a similar thing would happen), but I have no idea whether I'm on the right track or where to start looking to try resolve that one.\nAny thoughts about what could cause a device to become apparently 'powered off' from the USB bus, and why it would require Windows would be much appreciated.\nAdditional: We can actually get the cam to come back up if the machine has function keys for enable/disable webcam, but we've still not isolated what triggers it.\n\nA: It could be although I don't know for sure that Ubuntu 10.04 automatically disables the USB port and Windows re-enables it. Check the BIOS and see if it happens again before doing anything with Windows. Generally to get to BIOS you have to press F12 when the computer first turns on.\nJake\n", "Q: Can I add audio recorder to the sound menu? I want to add my audio-recorder to Ubuntu's sound menu.\nSound menu seems to use MPRIS commands over DBus to control the media players. So I could implement a minimal MPRIS for audio-recorder as well. Can I also change the icons that is shown on the sound menu? I mean, can I add my own buttons under the media-player?

Development will probably include going through some of the existing examples for Banshee, Rhythmbox and Exaile.\nYour biggest problem is going to be the record button. You can't add new buttons via the plugin. Instead you will have to add that to the sound indicator itself and push the change upstream.\n", "Q: ubuntu one not syncing... in windows XP Sp3 I already install the Ubuntu One 2.0 to try to connect to my storage, like I had done with beta, all of then installed correctly but when I try to sign in with my account it take a long time to get my information and it doesn't connect.\nWhen I log into the Ubuntu One site I connect without any problem.\n\nAfter one hour I receive a error pop-up with title \"ubuntuone-control-panel-qt\" with the error message \"AttributeError \"'NoneType? object has no attribute 'get_rootdir'\".\n\nA: I experienced the same problem with Ubuntu 2.0 on Windows 7 (64-bit, German).

I only have 10 addons installed but many of them they stop working on every update. Since the updates to not bring any new noticeable features but break them I don't want any updates anymore. \nI could lock firefox, but of course I still want security updates. I want to \"pin\" it to 7.* or preferably downgrade to 6.*. How do I do that without mozilla.debian.net? Will Old versions still get security fixes? \n\nA: \nWill Old versions still get security fixes?\n\nNo, not right now at least. Firefox 7 is the security update to Firefox 6, etc.\n\nI want to \"pin\" it to 7.* or preferably downgrade to 6.*.\n\nThat's not a good idea for those versions in particular, since (as noted above) you won't get security updates.\nGood news, though -- Mozilla's currently fleshing out a plan for \"extended support releases\" which will address this use-case.  There's a proposal posted on the Mozilla wiki.\nFor now, if you want to lock onto a specific version, 3.6.* is probably your safest bet (as noted in comments above), since that branch is still receiving security updates.\nAlternately, if Add-on breakage is your main problem, you can try using the Add-on Compatibility Reporter extension, which will force your add-ons to be treated as compatible, even if they haven't been explicitly  marked as such.  In rare cases, forced compatibility can cause add-ons not to work properly, but generally it makes them work fine in new versions.\n\nA: First you are attributing the Addons incompatible problem with Firefox instead of the true source of the problems, the Addons Developers. It is they who need to be compatible with the newer version for it to work. In my case, Firebug, Web Developer and Colorzilla need to work to be compatible with the newer version before it comes out, that is why it enters nightly, alpha, beta, rc stages. So it gives a change to the addon developers to have their work ready for the newer version.\nBut since this is not really a problem with the addon developers or the users that use them. It is a problem with time. Before this whole new release cycle. Devs had more time to work on their addons. With the new one their almost 8-9 month cycle went rapidly to a 2 week to 6 weeks time cycle. Very little for a dev.\nSo what has Mozilla proposed?\nBy default, starting from Firefox 8, addons will be assumed compatible with the latest firefox enhanced version of the addon manager until proven otherwise, either by a check to see if the addon gives an error (by user) or by the dev. This way if a particular addon has worked in all Firefox, the user has a chance to say that he/she would like the addon to still be enable in the latest firefox.\nThis helps in 2 points:\nPoint 1 - User can use an \"old\" addon in a new release. Removing the \"What the hell do you mean is incompatible\" face of the user.\nPoint 2 - Developer has time for more features and compatibility since a version change in Firefox will not (in most cases) affect the compatible nature of the addon and this way, giving the developer a bigger time frame. Bigger time frame = happier developer = haz cheezeburger\nLastly. I want to install version 6.\nOk the command aptitude has an option -t to tell which version of a package you wish to install. it also has an option for forbid-version to disable an upgrade to a particular package. Anyway there are a couple of more that you could see with aptitude --help\n\nA: I've just done the same for 8.0 version, after a feature was removed from 9.0.  \nHere is easy way: Open Synaptic and query 'firefox' then select 'Package > Force Version...' from the menu. Dialog will pop and you can select from available versions. Which versions is available also depends on your Firefox repository.

Does anyone know what is going on here, and how to achieve my goal of building a static python on Ubuntu 11.04?\n\nA: In order to just build the python binary, after your step (above error), you can manually run\ngcc -pthread -static -static-libgcc  -o python Modules/python.o libpython3.2m.a -lpthread -ldl  -lutil   -lm\n\nthe difference is -Xlinker -export-dynamic being removed.\nBut I did not test that binary for real use (just ran it and it runs).\n\nA: Well if you want to use a real static build you will have to use a different C library.\nGlibc will not do the trick for you, if you want to statically link you must hunt down the *.a verions of everything that you could possibly need during runtime and put them all into the application. If the environment changes you application will break.

For example I found out that a package named has is still installed, although in a brand new Ubuntu 11.04 installation it isn’t?\nSo is it recommended to make a complete new installation from time to time, rather than to upgrade continuously?\n\nA: I have upgraded continually since about 8.10 or 8.04, and I'm currently running 11.10. So, it's proof you can upgrade, upgrade, upgrade, and still have a working system.\nHowever, it requires a bit more work to keep doing this. Usually I upgrade manually (using Synaptic), but if you keep your system relatively free of useless applications, you can upgrade using the upgrade-manager and it will remove most of the old stuff (that is, things that are no longer able to work with the system, or that need to be replaced with something new).\nHowever, there is a catch, in that a lot of things can end up remaining installed, but marked as auto-removeable, or as local/obsolete, but they will only go away after you specifically remove them yourself.\n\nDoing a fresh install is advisable if you want a completely clean system each time, and many people do it that way. However, if you want to keep your old applications, then I would not suggest doing that.\n\nA: As a good recommendation I would say save your needed files and you ~/user folder in another pc or media and re-install.\nA lot has changed since 9.04!\n\nA: I concur with this advice.  My practice is to keep all of my data files on a separate disk partition.  This (a) makes the data very easy to back up regularly, and (b) makes it simple to do a new install of any new version of Ubuntu.\n", "Q: Execute command after dpkg installation?

When i plug in back HDMI still no display? so i search around google how to make it work and there is few articles about EDID so i guess i need that EDID for my TV and put it inside xorg.conf but i cant get my EDID couse ubuntu wont boot if there is HDMI \nSo im wondering what i can do to fix that first step thats booting with HDMI ? \nAnd how to get that EDID and display picture on tv with sound trougt HDMI if anyone can help ??\ni have\nMSI K9NGM3-FIH - aka ( MS-7349VER:1.1 ) Motherboard with HDMI on board here is link!\nPDP-427XD Pioneer plasma TV here is link!\nI think other specs are not important couse all works just TV, Ubuntu\nand HDMI are not frendly\n\nA: I plugged in VGA monitor and then i sow that Ubuntu is booting in console mode without GUI also i cant see anything:\n\nI can login but i cant see nothing and when i unplug hdmi and restart boots normaly to desktop and i plug in HDMI and run in terminal with this command\nneone@MediaCenter:~$ sudo get-edid | sudo parse-edid\nparse-edid: parse-edid version 2.0.0\nget-edid: get-edid version 2.0.0\n\n    Performing real mode VBE call\n    Interrupt 0x10 ax=0x4f00 bx=0x0 cx=0x0\n    Function supported\n    Call successful\n\n    VBE version 300\n    VBE string at 0x11100 \"NVIDIA\"\n\nVBE/DDC service about to be called\n    Report DDC capabilities\n\n    Performing real mode VBE call\n    Interrupt 0x10 ax=0x4f15 bx=0x0 cx=0x0\n    Function supported\n    Call successful\n\n    Monitor and video card combination does not support DDC1 transfers\n    Monitor and video card combination does not support DDC2 transfers\n    0 seconds per 128 byte EDID block transfer\n    Screen is not blanked during DDC transfer\n\nReading next EDID block\n\nVBE/DDC service about to be called\n    Read EDID\n\n    Performing real mode VBE call\n    Interrupt 0x10 ax=0x4f15 bx=0x1 cx=0x0\n    Function supported\n    Call failed\n\nThe EDID data should not be trusted as the VBE call failed\nError: output block unchanged\nparse-edid: IO error reading EDID\nneone@MediaCenter:~$ \n\nis there any other way to get edid and why this happen when i plug in HDMI ????\n", "Q: Cannot install updates on wubi I installed a wubi on my optiplex gx 620 recently on top of a windows xp. But after using it for about two weeks, I notice that the software update can never be carried out again. Every time I log in the system reminds me to do updates, but when I press the update button it flashes out a temporary message box (for about half a second) saying there is some authentication error (I can't get the complete message since it's too fast). This didn't bother me too much until today when I want to install foreign language support. The same flash message box appeared again and the installation cannot be done. After waiting for about 5 minutes a message box pops out saying \"time out most likely the daemon died\".\n I can give more details but I thought this might be a generic problem with wubi installation? \nupdates: after following the advice of fossfreedom, I think the upgrading is up and running! Before I only typed in sudo apt-get update, but I guess it's important to do upgrade as well! Thanks a lot!\nMy only lingering concern is how to do this upgrading automatically outside terminal. It seems there should be a way to enter password in a GUI? It would also be nice because sometimes I don't know the name of a particular software (like a language package) so it's easier to just upgrade in a GUI.\n\nA: Open the dash and type update manager will display your Update Manager.  Click the Settings button (bottom left)\n\nYou can set the frequency of updates and well as what you update as shown by the arrows in the picture.\nOpen the dash again and type startup applications\n\nMake sure that update notifier is checked - this will then automatically run update manager according to your update frequency defined above.\n", "Q: Add AD Domain user to sudoers from the command line I'm setting up an Ubuntu 11.04 server VM for use as a database server. It would make everyone's lives easier if we could have folks login using windows credentials and perhaps even make the machine work with the current AD-driven security we've got elsewhere. \nThe first leg of this was really easy to accomplish -- apt-get install likewise-open and I was pretty much in business. The problem I'm having is getting our admins into the sudoers groups -- I can't seem to get anything to take. I've tried:\na) usermod -aG sudoers [username]\nb) adding the user names in several formats (DOMAIN\\user, user@domain) to the sudoers file. \nNone of which seemed to take, I still get told \"DOMAIN\\user is not in the sudoers file. This incident will be reported.\"\nSo, how do I add non-local users to the sudoers?\n\nA: I encounter this problem and here's my solution:\nEdit /etc/sudoers: with the following entries\nFirst check aduser using command id \n#id <AD user>( #id domain\\\\aduser01 )\n\nResults on mine:\nSMB\\aduser01@linux01:~/Desktop$ id smb\\\\aduser02\nuid=914883676(SMB\\aduser02) gid=914883073(SMB\\domain^users) groups=914883073(SMB\\domain^users),1544(BUILTIN\\Administrators),1545(BUILTIN\\Users),914883072(SMB\\domain^admins)\n\ngetent passwd and gid NUMBERS doesn't work for me. DOMAIN\\\\domain^users works for me\n%SMB\\\\domain^users ALL=(ALL) ALL\n\nas we all know individual AD user works also\nSMB\\\\<aduser01> ALL=(ALL) ALL\n\n\nA: we have a long domain name with .local sufix, \nneighter the \n%domainname\\\\group ALL=(ALL) ALL\nnor the \n%domainname.local\\\\group ALL=(ALL) ALL\nworked...\nbut if I only use the groupname like this:\n%Domain^Admins ALL=(ALL) ALL\nit works.\n\nA: I use the common command\nsudo usermod -a -G sudo DOMAIN\\username \n\nand replace DOMAIN\\user with DOMAIN\\\\\\username.\n\nA: The problem with the other suggestions is that\n\n\n*\n\n*they only work when you have access to the corporate LAN (or VPN)\n\n*you have to maintain the sudoers file on each and every computer all the time\n\n*as a bonus, they didn't work for me - at all\n\n\nInstead, I wanted something that\n\n\n*\n\n*caches both the credentials and the sudo access\n\n*is centrally managed\n\n\nThe actual solution is using SSSD and extending the AD schema. This way SSSD fetches sudo settings and user credentials periodically from AD and maintains a local cache of them. The sudo rules are then stored in AD objects, where you can restrict rules to computers, users and commands, even - all that without ever touching a sudoers file on the workstations.\nThe exact tutorial is way too long to explain here, but you can find the step-by-step guide and some scripts to help with automation here:\n\n\n*\n\n*Integrating Ubuntu with Active Directory\nTL;DR:\nAD\nGrab the latest release of sudo, get the doc/schema.ActiveDirectory file, then import it (make sure to modify the domain path according to your domain name):\nldifde -i -f schema.ActiveDirectory -c \"CN=Schema,CN=Configuration,DC=X\" \"CN=Schema,CN=Configuration,DC=ad,DC=foobar,DC=com\" -j .\n\nVerify it with ADSI Edit: open the Schema naming context and look for the sudoRole class.\nNow create the sudoers OU on your domain root, this OU will hold all the sudo settings for all your Linux workstations. Under this OU, create a sudoRole object. To create the sudoRole object you have to use ADSI Edit, but once created, you can use Active Directory Users and Computers to modify it.\nLet's assume I have a computer named foo32linux, a user called stewie.griffin and I want to let him run all commands with sudo on that comp. In this case, I create a sudoRole object under the sudoers OU. For the sudoRole you can use any name you want - I stick with the computer name since I use per-computer rules. Now set its attributes as follows:\n\n\n*\n\n*sudoHost: foo32linux\n\n*sudoCommand: ALL\n\n*sudoUser: stewie.griffin\n\n\nFor commands you can use specific entries as well, like /bin/less or whatever.\nSSSD\nAdd to your /etc/sssd/sssd.conf, at least:\n[sssd]\nservices = nss, pam, sudo\n\n[domain/AD.FOOBAR.COM]\ncache_credentials = True\n\nSSSD refreshes its local cache with the updated rules every few hours, but the simplest way to test it is to just reboot the computer. Then log in with the AD user and check:\nsudo -l\n\nIt should list all the related entires you added to that user and computer. Easy-peasy!\n\nA: The best information I could find on the subject is here:\nhttp://www.mail-archive.com/likewise-open-discuss@lists.likewisesoftware.com/msg00572.html\nIt basically asks you to modify your /etc/sudoers file with the correct configuration to allow the people in your administrator's group on AD to have access to all privileges.\nIf you need to be selective and restrict by user, you can do that too. But it warns that you must make sure to find out what the user's name on the linux system is by using getend passwd command as shown.\n\nA: Using Centify direct I have added domain user into /etc/sudoers file.\n(Domain User)     ALL=(ALL) ALL\n\nA: My preferred answer would be @bviktor's, but I am not yet an advanced enough domain administrator.  None of the other answers above worked for me. I always got the same error message reported by OP.  The format of the error message suggests to me that the entries in sudoers are case-sensitive, but I have never seen any discussion of this in the numerous posts I have read on this subject. For example, some posts suggest the group name \"Domain^Admins\", whereas others suggest \"domain^admins\".\nNeither worked in my case.  On the DC (a Synology DS), the group is displayed as \"Domain Admins\", but on the client PC (running Ubuntu Studio 18.04), the command \"id\" returns the group as \"domain admins\".\nWhat did work for me was to use:\nsudo visudo\n\nas described above to add a single user instead of a group:\nusername@my.domain.name ALL=(ALL) ALL\n\nto the end of sudoers.\n\nA: sudo visudo then insert:\n\"%domain users\" ALL=(ALL) ALL\n\nworked for me on Ubuntu 20.04.2 LTS. It also worked with other arbitrary AD groups.\n\nA: OK, none of these answers actually worked for me. The answer stating to modify the AD schema might be a nice thing if you have a large fleet of Linux machines in your estate but for a small number that's not practical.\nWhat worked for me was this:\nCreate a sudo group in AD, add users to it.\non your Linux machines (with an account that can sudo):\ncreate a file in /etc/sudoers.d\nsudo touch /etc/sudoers.d/{yourdomain}\n\nNow edit the sudoers file with visudo.\nDon't make any changes and exist the editor, it should prompt you to edit the new file in sudoers.d.\nadd this to that file:\n%sudo@yourdomain.name ALL=(ALL:ALL) ALL\n\nSave that file.\nYou should be good now. The members of the sudo group in your AD can use sudo on any machine with this new file.\nAfter the user logs in while connected to the domain I have tested this with the computer (my laptop) disconnected from the domain and it still works as the group memberships are cached.\nNote: Do not edit the new file directly, that will not work.\n", "Q: Is this a Ubuntu Software Center Bug: Net connection not available Ubuntu Software Center does not recognize my net connection when I connect using wvdial, which I often do (even though Network-Manager works). \nIs this a bug? If so, where do I file a bug report for this?\nRegards,\nSantanu\n\nA: If any other application can connect to the Internet and Ubuntu Software Center cannot, then definitely something is wrong with it. Do report this bug, even if the bug is somewhere else (for example: in the wvdial, or in some system's network settings), the developers will help you diagnose this problem and determine the reason. The page where you should report bugs in Ubuntu Software Center is: https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/software-center/+filebug\n", "Q: Which folders are often written to, and how can I mount those folders on a separate drive? I have a headless ubuntu server acting as a fileserver (samba and ssh) and sometimes virtualbox host.\nIt is currently running from a USB drive, since all hard drive slots on the motherboard are occupied.\nSince any OS can be rather write happy, and flash memory drives have limited write lifespan , I want to minimize the number of writes the OS makes to the drive.\nI have already moved the swap files to one of the hard drives. Can I mount any other 'chatty' folders on the hard drives as well? (I imagine /var/log makes a few writes ever so often)\nWhich folders in a normal base ubuntu install are often written to, and how can I mount those folders on a separate drive?\n\nA: The Filesystem Hierarchy Standard specifies:\n\n/var contains variable data files\n\nSo moving /var should have the biggest impact.\nIf you have enough RAM, you could also mount /tmp as tmpfs because it usually contains only small files which don't have to be persistent between reboots. In fact the FHS even says:\n\nPrograms must not assume that any files or directories in /tmp are preserved between invocations of the program.\n\n", "Q: How do I view CoreDump file? When reporting a bug from a crash, the bug is made private and a file called CoreDump.gz. The Bug Triage documentation says the following:\n\nIf the crash still has a CoreDump.gz attachment, then it was not\n  possible to automatically get a fully symbolic stack trace and check\n  for duplicates.\n\nStacktrace.txt seems readable by a human. \nHow can I understand the meaning of a stack trace.\nCoreDump withing CoreDump.gz does not seem human readable.\nWhat is a \"fully symbolic stack trace\"?\nWhat is the difference between a \"fully symbolic stack trace\" \nHow do I view the contents of a CoreDump file? (tried 'cat', but it's not clean)\n\nA: Coredump.gz is the (compressed) memory accessible by the program that crashed. It is a binary file. Coredumps are a treasure trove, with all sorts of private data to be mined.\nCoredumps can be viewed by running 'gdb': \ngdb --core=mycoredump\n\nOf course, you will still need the debug packages associated with this core.\nYou can, then, generate a stacktrace by:\n(gdb) bt\n\nto generate a stacktrace of the current thread -- without parameter resolution --, or\n(gdb) thread apply all bt full\n\nto generate a stacktrace of all threads in the coredump, with parameter resolution.\nstacktrace and full stacktraces show the control flow within a program. For Python, the top of the stacktrace shows the oldest call, with the most recent at the bottom; for pretty much everything else, the top is the most recent call, and the bottom the oldest.\nA full stacktrace will not only show the flow, but also the parameter's values. This is where we usually find private data -- for example, say you see a function called \"validatePassword\" with a parameter called \"Password\", and a value of \"MySecretPassword\"...\nStacktraces are usually only helpful if the debug packages are installed (so that the stack frames can be resolved into something we can easily read). Analysis of a stacktrace will require one to have the sources that were used to build this specific program instance.\n", "Q: LSB error messages when running an upgrade After running sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get upgrade, I am shown this message in the terminal:\nPackage configuration\nConfiguring sysv-rc \nUnable to migrate to dependency-based boot system                           \nTests have determined that problems in the boot system exist which          \nprevent migration to dependency-based boot sequencing:                      \ninsserv: warning: script 'K20acpi-support' missing LSB tags and             \noverrides, insserv: warning: script 'alsa-store' missing LSB tags and       \noverrides, insserv: warning: script 'irqbalance' missing LSB tags and       \noverrides, insserv: warning: script 'dbus' missing LSB tags and             \noverrides, insserv: warning: script 'udevtrigger' missing LSB tags and      \noverrides, insserv: warning: script 'gdm' missing LSB tags and              \noverrides, insserv: warning: script 'console-setup' missing LSB tags and\n\n\nConfiguring sysv-rc\nUnable to migrate to dependency-based boot system                           \nTests have determined that problems in the boot system exist which          \nprevent migration to dependency-based boot sequencing:                      \ninsserv: warning: script 'K20acpi-support' missing LSB tags and             \noverrides, insserv: warning: script 'alsa-store' missing LSB tags and       \noverrides, insserv: warning: script 'irqbalance' missing LSB tags and       \noverrides, insserv: warning: script 'dbus' missing LSB tags and             \noverrides, insserv: warning: script 'udevtrigger' missing LSB tags and      \noverrides, insserv: warning: script 'gdm' missing LSB tags and              \noverrides, insserv: warning: script 'console-setup' missing LSB tags and    \nok                                                                           \n\nI am not sure how to fix that.

So I:\n\n*\n\n*Installed Ubuntu 11.04 desktop x86 on a VMWare virtual machine,\n\n*Installed eclipse-cdt and linux-headers-2.6.38-8 using Synaptic Package Manager,\n\n*Created a C Project named TestDriver1 and copy-pasted above code to it,\n\n*Changed the default build command, make, to the following customized build command:\n\nmake -C /lib/modules/2.6.38-8-generic/build M=/home/isaac/workspace/TestDriver1\nThe problem\nI get an error when I try to build this project using eclipse.

If you check out another branch later, that's ok, but you will need to re-index the source, and that takes about 20 minutes.\n\n*Start up Eclipse.\n\n*Click File->New->C Project\n\n*Fill in a project name like my_kernel\n\n*Uncheck the Use default location box and type in the root directory of your kernel into the Location box.\n\n*In the Project type: pane, click the Makefile project and select Empty Project\n\n*On the right side, select Linux GCC\n\n*Click Advanced settings... and a Properties dialog will pop up.\n\n*Select Resource on the left, and then in the Text file encoding section, select Other and ISO-8859-1 in the box, then click Apply\n\n*Open the C/C++ General selection on the left.\n\n*Click on Preprocessor Include Paths\n\n*Select GNU C in the Languages list\n\n*Select CDT User Setting Entries in the Setting Entries list\n\n*Click on Add.... Choose Preprocessor Macros File from the top left dropdown, Project Path from the top right dropdown, and enter include/generated/autoconf.h into the File text box. (Note: for older kernels [pre-2.6.36?], the location of autoconf.h is include/linux/autoconf.h)\n\n*Also add any other macros files you are using.\n\n*Click on Indexer\n\n*Checkmark the Enable project specific setttings box.\n\n*Uncheck Index source files not included in the build\n\n*Clear out the Files to index up-front box.\n\n*Click on Paths and Symbols on the left.\n\n*Select the Includes tab and then select GNU C\n\n*Click Add...\n\n*Click Workspace... then select your kernel's include directory\n\n*Do another Add, Workspace and add arch/architecture/include, e.g., arch/powerpc/include\n\n*Click the # Symbols tab\n\n*Click Add...\n\n*Set the name to __KERNEL__\n\n*Set the value to 1 and click OK\n\n*Click the Source Location tab\n\n*Click the twisty for your project.\n\n*Select the Filter item and click Edit Filter...\n\n*Click Add Multiple... and then select all of the arch/* directories in your kernel source that will not be used (i.e. all the ones that are not for the architecture you are using)\n\n*Click OK and OK again to dismiss that dialog.\n\n*Click OK on the Properties dialog.\n\n*Click Finish on the C Project dialog.\n\n*Right click on the project and select Index then select Rebuild\n\n*It will take about 20 minutes or so to complete. \n\n*Open your project setting, go to the C/C++ build -> Behaviour (tab)\n\n*Check the Build (Incremental buil) checkbox and add your module path to the textbox (in my case M=drivers/servo/dynamixel).\n\n*When you're module is ready and you want to compile kernel, repeat 41 and replace M=.. with all.\n\n\nA: If you want to do driver development with eclipse, you will have to do it the other way round. \nYou will need to catch up on automake, autogen, pkg-config and so on, create an autotools project and import it into eclipse. The eclipse-cdt should offer this otherwise you missed to install the 'autotools-plugin' (unsure about exact name, writing this from memory).\nJust abandon the idea that eclipse-cdt could manage a decent Makefile, C isn't Java, unfortunately or thankfully.\n\nA: I am new too in Linux driver programming, I found that there a new way to deploy kernel modules (which are not in the official Linux tree) called DKMS. The module will be installed as source and DKMS will take care of compiling it for each kernel. It means the Makefile for module will be written manually and it's source will be not included for autotools.\nhttp://linux.dell.com/dkms/\nupdated...\nDKMS moved to http://en.community.dell.com/techcenter/os-applications/w/wiki/2463.linux-projects.aspx\nThis tutorials/quick introduction to DKMS (links from Dell project page):\nLinux Journal article , Power Solutions paper , Ottawa Linux Symposium paper\nDKMS used for quick driver deploying. For example kernel modules using DKMS in my Ubuntu machine:\ndkms status\n\nbcmwl, 6.20.155.1+bdcom, 3.5.0-41-generic, x86_64: installed\nbcmwl, 6.20.155.1+bdcom, 3.5.0-42-generic, x86_64: installed\nbcmwl, 6.20.155.1+bdcom, 3.5.0-43-generic, x86_64: installed\nnvidia, 313.26, 3.5.0-42-generic, x86_64: installed\nnvidia, 313.26, 3.5.0-43-generic, x86_64: installed\nvboxhost, 4.3.0, 3.5.0-42-generic, x86_64: installed\nvboxhost, 4.3.0, 3.5.0-43-generic, x86_64: installed\n\nThis is the code I have written before, It could be helpful as DKMS Hello World.\nhttps://github.com/sneetsher/RTD-DM5408-Driver-Port-for-Linux\n\nA: 1> you can try with this command\n\"make\" --> \"/usr/bin/make\"\n/usr/bin/make -C /lib/modules/2.6.38-8-generic/build M=/home/isaac/workspace/TestDriver1\n\n2> in directory store your hello word code,creat file name \"Makefile\"\nobj-m := NameofyourHelloWold.o \n\nKDIR  := /lib/modules/2.6.38-8-generic/build\n\nPWD   := $(shell pwd)\n\ndefault:\n    $(MAKE) -C $(KDIR) M=$(PWD) modules\n\n", "Q: How to change the color themes in gnome 3? How to change the color themes in gnome 3? Anyone? (Note using 11.10)\n\nA: You have to directly edit the theme. The themes are located under /usr/share/themes. For the Adwaita theme, the colors are declared in the gtk.css file.\n\nA: A simpler way:\nsudo apt-get install gnome-colors gnome-tweak-tool\n\nThen, run the command in the terminal:  \ngnome-tweak-tool\n\nThen go to theme/icon theme.\n\nA: The new way:\nsudo apt-get install gnome-colors gnome-tweak-tool\n\nThen, run the command in the terminal:\ngnome-tweaks\n\nThen go to theme/icon theme.\n\nA: Some pretty nice ones can be found here (in German):\nhttp://wiki.ubuntuusers.de/Gnome_Shell/Themes#Shell-Designs\n", "Q: Nvidia NVS 4200M Problems on Lenovo T420S I have a problem in getting the NVIDIA card to load.  I get the classic \"no screens\" found.  I've even forced it to used \"ConnectedMonitor\" DFP-0 for my laptop screen.\nI suspect that something is wrong with my settings that will recognize my flat panel.  My NVIDIA drivers do not see it and then Optimus kicks in the onboard intel video drivers and it loads up X that way. \nI have tried all the different variations with no avail (Nouveau, bumblebee+nvidia_current, nvidia-current alone, and NVIDIA drivers from NVIDIA site).\nInterestingly enough, if I attach a monitor via DVI connector through a docking station, NVIDIA drivers load up successfully and finds DFP-3.  The external monitor gets Unity loaded, but the laptop monitor goes blank.\nHELP!\nCurrent xorg.conf:\nSection \"ServerLayout\"\n    Screen         \"Screen0\" Relative \"Screen1\" 0 0\n    Identifier     \"Layout0\"\n    Screen         \"Screen0\" 0 0\n    InputDevice    \"Keyboard0\" \"SendCoreEvents\" \"CoreKeyboard\"\n    InputDevice    \"Mouse0\" \"SendCoreEvents\" \"CorePointer\"\nEndSection\n\nSection \"InputDevice\"\n    Identifier     \"Mouse0\"\n    Driver         \"mouse\"\n    Option         \"Protocol\" \"auto\"\n    Option         \"Device\" \"/dev/psaux\"\n    Option         \"Emulate3Buttons\" \"no\"\n    Option         \"ZAxisMapping\" \"4 5\"\nEndSection\n\nSection \"InputDevice\"\n    Identifier     \"Keyboard0\"\n    Driver         \"kbd\"\nEndSection\n\nSection \"Monitor\"\n    Identifier     \"Monitor0\"\n    VendorName     \"Unknown\"\n    ModelName      \"Unknown\"\n    HorizSync       28.0 - 33.0\n    VertRefresh     43.0 - 72.0\n    Option         \"DPMS\"\nEndSection\n\nSection \"Monitor\"\n    Identifier     \"Monitor1\"\n    VendorName     \"Samsung\"\n    ModelName      \"Samsung SMS27A850\"\n    HorizSync       30.0 - 90.0\n    VertRefresh     56.0 - 75.0\nEndSection\n\nSection \"Device\"\n    Identifier     \"Device0\"\n    Driver         \"nvidia\"\n    VendorName     \"NVIDIA Corporation\"\n    BoardName      \"NVS 4200M\"\n    BusID          \"PCI:1:0:0\"\nEndSection\n\nSection \"Device\"\n    Identifier     \"Device1\"\n    Driver         \"nvidia\"\n    VendorName     \"NVIDIA Corporation\"\n    BoardName      \"NVS 4200M\"\n    BusID          \"PCI:0:2:0\"\nEndSection\n\nSection \"Screen\"\n    Identifier     \"Screen0\"\n    Device         \"Device0\"\n    Monitor        \"Monitor0\"\n    DefaultDepth    24\n    Option         \"MetaModes\" \"DFP-0: nvidia-auto-select, nvidia-auto-select\"\n    Option         \"TwinView\" \"true\"\n    Option         \"RandRRotation\" \"true\"\n    SubSection     \"Display\"\n        Depth       24\n        Modes      \"1600x900\" \"1920x1080\" \"2560x1440\"\n    EndSubSection\nEndSection\n\nSection \"Screen\"\n    Identifier     \"Screen1\"\n    Device         \"Device1\"\n    Monitor        \"Monitor1\"\n    DefaultDepth    24\n    Option         \"TwinView\" \"true\"\n    Option         \"RandRRotation\" \"true\"\n    SubSection     \"Display\"\n        Depth       24\n        Modes      \"1600x900\" \"1920x1080\" \"2560x1440\"\n    EndSubSection\nEndSection\n\nLSPCI Results\nlspci -nn | grep VGA\n00:02.0 VGA compatible controller [0300]: Intel Corporation 2nd Generation Core Processor Family Integrated Graphics Controller [8086:0126] (rev 09)\n01:00.0 VGA compatible controller [0300]: nVidia Corporation Device [10de:1056] (rev a1)\nMy GPU INFO\nnvidia-xconfig --query-gpu-info\nif I don't have the external monitor connected and I query GPU info:\nNumber of GPUs: 1\n\nGPU #0:\n  Name      : NVS 4200M\n  PCI BusID : PCI:1:0:0\n\n  Number of Display Devices: 0\n\nif I do have it ... it shows me that I have one Display Device connected.\nMy Xorg.0.log:\n    [     7.228] \nX.Org X Server 1.10.1\nRelease Date: 2011-04-15\n[     7.228] Markers: (--) probed, (**) from config file, (==) default setting,\n    (++) from command line, (!!) notice, (II) informational,\n    (WW) warning, (EE) error, (NI) not implemented, (??) unknown.\n[     7.228] (==) Log file: \"/var/log/Xorg.0.log\", Time: Fri Sep 30 20:39:30 2011\n[     7.229] (==) Using system config directory \"/usr/share/X11/xorg.conf.d\"\n[     7.229] (==) No Layout section.

your hardware , but i get the same issues on my laptop with two graphic cards.\nIn my case its was caused by the fact that the other card is not connected to my internal laptop monitor( it can only be connected to one graphic card at a time. If you're unable to successfully switch on / off / the proper card and switch in on to the monitor. This is what you get.\nI got it working by poking some memory addresses manually in grub. In your case you probably need to do something specific for your hardware. Have you triedd using switcheroo?\nhttps://help.ubuntu.com/community/HybridGraphics\n", "Q: How to recover grub2? I installed Ubuntu 11.10 and then after that, I upgraded my Lubuntu 10.10 to 11.04. The grub2 initiated through the installation overwrote the grub written by Ubuntu. After that, I can't find any boot entries leading to Ubuntu or Windows 7 in the grub menu.

There is a lot of devices with a single-touch screen and the Oneiric Unity has no always-visible Dash icon. So, how can I get it without keyboard providing that moving pointer to the edge is almost impossible on the majority of resistive touchscreens?\nOne way I know of is to use easystroke with Button1 for gestures and short timeout. Didn't try Win-button emulation yet but there is a CLI way:\nIs there a way to launch Unity Dash outside of Unity?\nAnother ways you know of such as easy Taskbar-icon creation?\n\nA: Just set your launcher to be always-visible:\n'CompizConfig Settings Manager' (CCSM) >> Category: Desktop >>\n  'Ubuntu Unity Plugin' >> Behavior >> Hide Launcher: Never\nI have already set this, as I did not like the disappearing / windowing re-sizing of the default behavior.\n\nA: If you have a keyboard, hit the Windows/Super button.\n", "Q: When I type in terminal: export JDK_HOME=\"/usr/lib/jvm/java-6-sun/\", where does it get stored?

After yesterday's update unity has stopped appearing. I did update a few minutes back too, but still it's not working with my default account. Surprisingly it works with 'Guest' login and a new administrator type account which I am using now. In my default account I am greeted with a blank screen. Going to tty1 and typing unity or unity --reset did not make any difference.\n\nA: I might have been in the same situation. What had happened for me yesterday (after updating) is that for some reason the Unity plugin was disabled due to keyboard shortcut conflicts. I tried unity --reset, but it didn't help.\nSo here's one thing you could check:\n\n\n*\n\n*Enter CCSM (CompizConfig Settings Manager)\n1a. If you don't have it, run sudo apt-get install compizconfig-settings-manager\n\n*Check that Unity plugin is enabled.\n\n*If not, try to enable it. If it asks a lot of questions about conflicts, just click on \"Turn off ...\" on all of them, that means some other plugins use those shortuts, but Unity should have the priority.\n\n\nNot sure you're in the same boat, but might be worth checking.\n-EDIT-\nI misread, I could at least enter the desktop with no unity and launch a terminal with CTRL + ALT + T.

(.deb) packaging mechanism.\nA .rpm is a different packaging mechanism called RPM Package Manager - you cannot install a .rpm directly on a .deb based distro - and visa versa.\nEither download the sources themselves and compile the software or look for a .deb package which you can install.\nFor some simple .rpm packages you can use \"alien\" \nsudo alien -d -i [package_name].rpm\n\nThis could create a .deb file which you may be able to install.  However, this is very hit-and-miss - strongly suggest find the .deb or compile from source.\n\nA: Read the Install.pdf that came with Geomatica carefully - especially near the bottom where it discusses the use of the LD_LIBRARY_PATH environment variable.  Once you set up  as they discuss, and possible download a legacy OpenSSl-v0.9.8 that suplies some of the OLD stuff they use (also OpenMotif - old version), it may just work.\nI use Centos 6.0 on a AMD 64 bit system. works but is clunky and slow compared to the Win7 version. Shame on them!\n", "Q: Incorrect port, user and password for my futon couchdb.html my ~/.local/share/desktop-couch/couchdb.html has the wrong values for port, username and password. It seems quite likely that this is due to a reinstall without formatting /home. My Python scripts work well with my desktopcouch, but I would like to use Futon as well. What is the most elegant way of recreating that file with proper values? \n\nA: Well, it was really quite simple; just delete the cookies from localhost. (If you have other local webuis running, you might want to manually find the one that points to _utils.) After doing so, the next time you login it will ask for a confirmation and it will remember the username, password and port to connect to.\n\nA: That file is regenerated each time desktopcouch starts up.  This is necessary because the desktop instance of couchdb is run on a random port.  If you can't log in via that file, it probably means that desktopcouch is not running (it is started on demand rather than on login).\nYou should be able to get desktopcouch to start by running an application that uses it.  Alternatively, you can activate it by sending a dbus message to it:\ndbus-send --session --print-reply --type=method_call \\\n    --dest=org.desktopcouch.CouchDB / org.desktopcouch.CouchDB.getPort\n\n", "Q: Can't have access to the menu of desktop unless I click any icon at the launcher I have recently installed Nautilus Elementary for which I've read about here.\nI think after this change the problem arised.\nNow everytime I log in my account and before clicking any other icons at the launcher I   cannot see the menu \"File Edit View Places Help\" on the top bar.\nEven if I click an of the indicators I still can't access that menu.\nWhat is wrong?

But maybe I can clarify the logic behind the xorg.conf configuration file.\nFrom man xorg.conf:\n\nXorg supports several mechanisms for supplying/obtaining configuration and run-time parameters:\n  \n  \n*\n  \n*command line options\n  \n*environment variables\n  \n*the xorg.conf and xorg.conf.d configuration files\n  \n*auto-detection\n  \n*fallback defaults.\n  \n  \n  When the same information is supplied in more than one way, the highest precedence mechanism is used. The list of mechanisms is ordered from highest precedence to lowest. Note that not all parameters can be supplied via all methods. \n\nThe X server is thus able to automatically detect the connected hardware. As far as I know this is the case for some time. If the auto-detection fails you can do the configuration manually, by creating a configuration file. There are several locations where you can store the configuration file. The locations are listed in the man page of xorg.conf. The default location on Ubuntu is /etc/X11/xorg.conf. If you create a configuration file, then you don't have to configure everything manually. Instead you must only configure the parts where the automatic detection fails.\n", "Q: Minimize/Maximize all windows command? \nPossible Duplicate:\nHow to “show desktop” from command line? \n\nI was wondering if there was a shell command that minimizes/maximizes all windows.\nI have heard of wmctrl -k on, but the program 'wmctrl' is not a default in Ubuntu.\nThanks!\n\nA: Super-D will minimize/restore all windows.\nhttp://www.ubuntugeek.com/list-of-ubuntu-unity-keyboard-shortcuts.html\n\nA: wmctrl is available in the Universe repository.

I want to make some Virtual IP Addresses for my network adapter or wireless adapter, so that I can connect to network with more than one IP address from one computer or laptop.\nHow can I do it? (I know it's possible ,because one of my friends has done it in university and have more than one - some times till 255 - IP address in network).\n\nA: Virtual MAC address? I think you mean \"virtual IP addresses\". See man 5 interfaces, and follow the documentation links at the very end. On my system, it says:\n\nFor  advice  on  configuring  this  package  read  the  Network  Configuration chapter of the Debian Reference manual, available at http://www.debian.org/doc/manuals/debian-reference/ch05.en.html or in the debian-reference-en package.\nExamples of how to set up interfaces can be found in /usr/share/doc/ifupdown/examples/network-interfaces.gz.\n\nBut, even if you assign extra IP addresses, your traffic is still going in/out of your system through the SAME NIC.

Bought very fast laptop but did not check graphics compatibility. Now after installing the proprietary driver from ati (amd) on Ubuntu 10.10 gives me \"not supported\" watermark on the right bottom. After checking some forums (google is your best friend) I discovered that my lap has 2 graphic cards, amd hd 6850m and intel hd3000 as secondary. \nAlso, after installing this driver It slows down my graphics (so slower as with the default open source). \nMy question:\n\n\n*\n\n*Is there any way to unleash the potential of my graphics with this proprietary driver?\n\n*Is using the open source drivers the only option? \nI don't think the actual ati graphic card is used, but the intel3000 by mistake.\nPS: Natty gives no better results\nEdit 15.12.2011 : It works, it works !!!

Thank you guys\n\nA: I'm happy to tell you that the Catalyst 11.9 is in the Ubuntu respos!\nNow, you can just install it by the \"colsed source drivers\" managger.\nNote: It's important, that you'll need a clean install! That means must not any previos versions of catalyst is installed, or were installed on your system since the last full install. Pleas also note, that you have to install the post-upgrade version of catalyst, and only this version. It's also notable that the managger will tell you that \"installation failed, please see jockey.log\" but do nothing, reboot your system, and everything will work fine.\n\nA: \nFor the question 1.\nThe newest proprietary driver(catalyst 11.9) solves the problem with watermark for AMD 6850M watermark. You can prepare your own fglrx packages with the help of:\nhttp://wiki.cchtml.com/index.php/Ubuntu_Natty_Installation_Guide.\nSee section Installing the drivers manually.\n\n\nA: There is also a nother way to fix things - Go to the AMD website, and download the lastest catalyst (11.10). Install it manually.\nAfter a sucesfull install, and a reboot there will be a bug, and the driver won't start.\nGo to a terminal prompt (CTRL+ALT+F1) log in and get root rights (sudo -s).\nThe driver is fails, becaous it searches libGL.so.1 at a wrong place, we'll do a link for it.\nlink /usr/lib64/libGL.so.1 /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libGL.so.1\n\n(I think, if you have 32-bit system, you'll have to use lib32 instead lib64 in the first path, but I can't test it.)\nSet up the fglrx again:\naticonfig --initial\n\nAfter that, restart x (or reboot) and everithing should work fine (=works for me).\nNote for programmers: In the system preferences, the tab will still say you're using vesa drivers, but that could be a bug. I have good fps (at least 200 at fullscreen) and catalyst center each settings works correctly, and also CPU-stats doesent seems to inercase on graphics movements. (It does it when I use vesa) Even if it works even better for me than by default, I'm not sure it's not vesa: I'm not a developer of any driver, just found a lib which fits to the missing one but it could be different.\n", "Q: How to integrate gnome-online-accounts? There is a new feature called gnome-online-accounts, which has been introduced in Gnome3 , but its still not integrated into Ubuntu 11.10.\nDoes anyone know how to get this working?\n\nA: I've been looking at this from the perspective of adding support for this in some GNOME Do plugins.  gnome-online-accounts is basically a single-sign-on API.  It provides a way for applications to get an authentication cookie for the configured online accounts.  It does not provide anything else; it's up to the application to know how to use that cookie to talk to the online service.\nAs such, it's entirely dependent on the applications to (a) query gnome-online-accounts for configured online services, and (b) actually know how to interact with those online services.\nYou can think of it as basically gnome-keyring for your online services.  It has been integrated into Ubuntu 11.10, in so much as the GNOME apps which support g-o-a will use it; there just aren't many apps that use it yet ☺.\n\nA: It seems its partially incorporated! I installed gnome-documents. It works. It picked up the documents from my google docs after a restart. However Evolution and Empathy does not pickup gmail and gtalk automatically. It has to be added manually. It does not show events from google calendar as well.\nUPDATE: After today's update, Evolution is automatically picking up gmail accounts and google calendar dates are being shown below the calendar in both Unity and Gnome SHell. Only updates missing are from Empathy. I am assuming this will be integrated by 13th.\n\nA: I'm not entirely sure, but it looks like basic support was integrated into ubuntu 11.10 recently. After updating, you can find it in the user indicator under 'Online Accounts...'\n\nA: The online accounts only work with Google at the moment. According to a post on the Gnome developers mailing list we should see more coming down the line, but possibly not until Gnome 3.4 list thread\nOf course I am assuming that once this gets developed Ubuntu will have it integrated as well.\n", "Q: Is Logitech HD Webcam C615 supported?

I know this could sound like a silly question.\nBut I have always wondered what the free space on a Ubuntu partition should be!\nWith should be I mean how much do I need free to be able to run everything as smoothly as possible and get the best amount of speed form my computer. \n\n\n*\n\n*Is it 10%? 10GB? or something else?\n\n*is it specific for this hard drive or only the Ubuntu partition? \n\n*Is it specific for \"/home\"? (if you have separate system and personal stuff.)\n\n\nA: Well. It varies... \nFirst of all, on *IX all filesystems usually have a reserved space, accessible only to root; nowadays it is 5% of the filesystem size (by default), but can be larger or smaller. If you are running as the superuser, then there is no reserve.\nSo, whatever is your filesystem size, you can actually use up to (100 - reserved space).\nThere is no fixed response to your question: it depends on how you use the filesystem. For normal usage (i.e., a desktop/laptop with email, browser, music, videos), a probable safe bet is around 60-80%. If the disk contents is volatile -- meaning lots of changes, large files being created/deleted, etc -- then you can expect degradation as the filesystem gets filled up. Now... of old, a good initial bet was \"be worried if it is 80% full\"; but with the current crop of extremely large drives, it does not make a lot of sense anymore -- 20% free space off 1T is still 200G! -- and this is one of the reasons the reserved space is now only ~ 5%.\nBut... rule of thumb for generic use... I would say tops at 70%, then start considering an upgrade/additional drive ;-)\nIf, OTOH, you are just adding files one after the other, never (re)moving them, then you can safely use all space available with no impact.\nAnd yes, there can be fragmentation, which can cause degradation on read/write times.\n", "Q: How do I access the settings in first time wizard in E17? ... and other settings in general.

Problem:  I created 3 DVD's filled with Windows system recovery disks in case I ever have a hardware problem and need to re-install Windows in order to run diagnostic tests.  However, I don't want to worry about losing them, so I would like to make backups of the recovery disks as ISO images which I can store on an external hard drive.\nA Google search revealed that I can do this using the dd (or \"disk dump\") unix command.\ndd if=/dev/who-knows-where? of=/home/wdkrnls/x201-recovery-2011-09-30.iso\n\nBut the snag is that Ubuntu doesn't use the old convention of associating /dev/cdrom with the cd-rom drive.  Instead Nautilus automagically creates /media/CD_ROM which is a directory, and not the drive itself.  I tried to run dd anyways and got:\n\n/bin/dd: reading '/media/CD_ROM/': is a directory\n  0+0 records in\n  0+0 records out\n  0 bytes (0 B) copied, 0.0158501 s, 0.0 kB/s\n\nI tried running dmesg | tail and saw a reference to:\n\n[215135.134164] sr 9:0:0:0: Attached scsi generic sg1 type 5\n\nSo I tried ls /dev/sg1, but there wasn't any file called that.

This has left 232 GiB of unallocated space at the end of the drive that I would like to redistribute amongst the existing partitions. I would like to add some to sda1, some to sda2, etc.. I realize that one can only merge partition space when the unallocated space is adjacent, but can't figure out the best way to do this, given existing partitions are all primary... Can someone advise on this? BTW, since this is a cloned drive, the original is still intact, so I don't need to backup.\n\n\nA: You can move partitions with gparted. Start my moving the swap partition to the end of the drive. Select the parition and click the resize/move button. You can drag it to the end. Click apply to see it happen. This one should be pretty fast.\nThe moving of the other partitions will take a really long time as it has to move every piece of data in the partition. I would have a play with moving and resizing without hitting apply to figure out what you want to do. Then when you have the plan written down, perform each action one at a time.\nSomething like:\n\n\n*\n\n*Move swap\n\n*grow sda3 to x  (this will fast as it is just adding empty spave on the end)\n\n*move sda3 (this will take a long time)\n\n*grow sda2 to y\n\n*move sda2\n\n*grow sda1 to the rest\n\n\nAs you can see you should to grow a partition before you move it as that will make it a lot easier to line up the new partitions.\n\nA: Since you have the original, you should:\n\n\n*\n\n*start with an empty drive (no cloning)\n\n*copy the partitions one by one from old drive to new drive (resizing while copying should be possible)\n\n*create swap, don't copy it\n\n*chroot into new drive and do install-grub (since this isn't a clone. the master boot record didn't get copied).\n\n\nThis should be much faster than cloning + resizing.\n", "Q: How to specify non-default audio stream to MPlayer?

Start using compiz --replace.\n", "Q: Where is the terminal server client (tsclient?) I accidentally done partial upgrade and there was Gnome3 ppa and broke my unity. After failed attempt to rescue (ppa-purge et al) I decided the only solution was to upgrade to Oneiric beta2 (fresh install is not an option). Now In Natty I was using terminal server client to do remote connection (mostly RDP). I cannot find tsclient in package. I have googled with no avail. I have tested Remmina and the other Ubuntu RDP packages and I'm dissatisfied at best. Is there a way to install terminal server client?\nDid Oneiric abandon it? What is their proposed alternative?\nIMHO terminal server client is the best RDP client (GUI)\nThanks!\n\nA: It looks like TSClient has been removed in Oneiric. Due to problems with compatibility to GTK3.\nThey propose another application: Vinagre. \ntsclient will install with errors, but does work.\nDownload deb file from ubuntu and install\nhttp://packages.ubuntu.com/natty/i386/tsclient/download\nTested and working on 11.10 with Unity and Gnome 3\n\nA: I'm using Remmina from much time and I'm satisfied of it, comparing with tsclient it's modern and easy to save and group connections. I think it will become the standard RDP client.\nYou can also integrate it in Unity: Remmina Unity Launcher\nAs an alternative, you can also launch rdesktop directly from the command line.\n", "Q: Installing updates from hard drive I am using Oneiric Beta 2.\nInstalled it yesterday. Then downloaded 350+ MB of updates and installed it.\nThen when I tried to auto-mount my drives using Storage manager, I screwed up and the system will boot right up to the Ubuntu Splash screen, then turn off.\nAnyways planning to reinstall Ubuntu again. But I do not want to have to download the updates again. I have a copy of all the downloaded update files with me. \nCan anyone tell me how I can install the updates from the hard drive without downloading them again ??\nThanks in advance.....\n\nA: sudo dpkg -i *.deb will install all the .deb packages on the current directory in to your system.\nOpen a terminal, change the directory to where you saved your downloaded packages and use the command to install the packages that you previously saved.\nIf you have copied the packages to a USB pen, plug it in, open a terminal and change directory to where the USB pen was mounted (it should be a mount point under /media).\nAfter you located the files you saved use the command to install the files.\n", "Q: How can I help Canonical be profitable? \n*\n\n*I can buy cloud space from ubuntu one instead of dropbox, etc .... right?\n\n*Does buying system76 computers help canonical in anyway?\n\n\nWhat else can we do? Please add to this list.\n\nA: *\n\n*You can purchase any mp3 music you buy through the Ubuntu One Music Store (accessible via Rhythmbox in ubuntu-10.04 & 10.10 and Banshee in ubuntu-11.04 & 11.10) and/or the Amazon MP3 Store (accessible via Banshee in ubuntu-11.04 & 11.10).\n\n*You can contribute directly to the ubuntu project. Help is needed in translating materials, creating wikis, developing & writing manuals for how to do things (e.g., I just read one on how to use Ubuntu Software Center), basic sorting of bugs, and so forth. There are many ways to help out even if you don't know how to code.\n\nA: Where Canonical makes money is in many different areas. The simplest way most can help is to advocate purchasing support - Ubuntu Advantage - especially in the enterprise.\nBasically, if you use Ubuntu in your business please contribute. For most businesses that means buying Ubuntu Advantage.\n\nA: Canonical provides support services that you can use. Check these links for more details:\nTraining\nUbuntu Advantage\nUbuntu Home Support\nIndirectly, you can convince organisations/companies/universities to switch to Ubuntu by citing the benefits that they will get from free and open source software (FOSS). This way, if these organisations/companies/universities opt for the Canonical Support services, Canonical will get more profits!\nOther than support services, you can buy accessories and software (including Ubuntu CD/DVDs) as well from the Canonical Store in general.\n\nA: You can buy merchandise on Canonical Store, there are a lot of good things. I bought some pens, the A5 notebook, and some Ubuntu CDs. Now I'm waiting for Oneiric release for buying CDs with the new beautiful Polo Shirt!\nAnd surely, you can help Canonical spreading Ubuntu, this is the greatest contribuite, specially in business.\n", "Q: iptables on desktop I have some iptables rules and a policy that I want to apply to my desktop. Where is the the configuration file that will make these changes permanent?\nIs there any issues with using iptables and NetworkManager?\n\nA: NetworkManager has nothing to do with iptables, although you may run into issues if you're using other firewalling software like ufw. The default ruleset that is applied by iptables-apply is /etc/network/iptables, so let's use that one.\nThe rules file looks like:\n*FILTER\n\n# filter rules here, example below:\n\n# Reject incoming packets by default\n:INPUT REJECT\n\n# example of established packets: you request askubuntu.com and a response is\n# send back to TCP port 80\n-A INPUT -m state --state RELATED,ESTABLISHED -j ACCEPT\n# Allow traffic to the loopback adapter (\"localhost\")\n-A INPUT -i lo -j ACCEPT\n\nCOMMIT\n\nNote that a newline after COMMIT is mandatory, without it the file won't load correctly. If you wish to see your current ruleset, run sudo iptables-save to output the rules to standard output.\nNow create the executable /etc/network/if-pre-up.d/iptables file to load the rules on startup:\n#!/bin/sh\n/sbin/iptables-restore < /etc/network/iptables\n\nDo note that if you apply rules during a session (read: before the machine is shutdown/ rebooted), these will be lost on shutdown. If you wish to keep such rules, create another script for saving the rules. Note that comments and such are lost.\n/etc/network/if-pre-down.d:\n#!/bin/sh\n/sbin/iptables-save > /etc/network/iptables\n\n", "Q: How to access shared files on Ubuntu from a windows machine? I have shared a folder on my ext4 drive mounted at /media/data using the GUI.  \n\nNow it appears in my Places -> Network and I'm able to access it, after giving password, at smb://wim-ubuntu/ab/\nHowever in windows I can't access the share, they see this error:\n\nI have tried creating a user on the Ubuntu machine with username/password which match what the windows user has, but no joy...  what am  I missing?\nThe 'diagnose' button on windows doesn't really offer anything useful, it says that the location WIM-UBUNTU exists but the share can not be found.  \n\nA: On way of doing it is to add the shares in /etc/samba/smb.conf\nwith the following format.\n[sharename]\n         path = /media/yourshare\n\nIf you are having problems with login you can allways use this to test if the samba server works.\nguest account = yourusername\nguest ok = yes\n\nBut these should only be used for testing, because it disables your security, and tells samba that all the guest's are you.\nSome other usefull parameters/settings are:\nread only = yes\nvalid users = yourusername\n\nWhen you have the configuration file as you like, restart the samba deamon.\nsudo service smbd restart\n\n\nA: I had same problem.

My Banshee Media Player on my laptop deleted all my songs. I pressed \"Remove from Library\" on one song and it deleted all my songs. How do I get them back? I need help ASAP.\n\nA: As @grahammechanical said in the comment above, all of your music should still be on your computer -- probably in your ~/Music folder.  From within Banshee, go to Tools > Rescan Music Library and Banshee should automatically re-import all of the songs.  If that doesn't work, you can re-import manually by going to Media > Import Media, and choose to import your entire Music folder.\nBut removing all of your songs when you try to remove one is a very weird issue.  If you can reproduce the problem, I'm sure the Banshee developers would appreciate it if you report it here: http://banshee.fm/contribute/file-bugs/\nBefore you try to test this out (and in general, if you're worried about problems with your music library) you might want to make a backup copy of your database.  The following command will create a copy of your Banshee database in the same folder as the normal database:\ncp ~/.config/banshee-1/banshee.db ~/.config/banshee-1/banshee.db.backup\n\n", "Q: What video editing programme is capable of placing two videos side by side? I would like to show the left half of the first video on the left, and the right half of the second on the right.\nAre there any programmes that offer this feature, or is there a workaround anyone can think of?\n\nA: You can try shotcut (http://shotcut.org/bin/view/Shotcut). It comes with the posibility for video compositing. Just like in Openshot you can include one video on track and another on another track. Then you will enable to composite option on the left side of each track. Now you can apply on each the filter \"resize\" and put each video in it's place on the screen. \n\nA: OpenShot\n\n\n\n*\n\n*Place clips on two separate tracks.\n\n*Right click first video and choose Layout 1/4 Size - Top Left\n\n*Right click second video and choose Layout 1/4 Size - Top Right\n\n*Right click first video and choose Show All (Maintain Ratio)\n\nA: You can use OpenShot. This method is slightly longer than previous answers, but it will remove the black bars at the top and bottom of the screen.\n\n*\n\n*Create two tracks, and place the one clip in each track.\n\n*Go to the top and open the profiles menu:  Edit → Preferences → Profiles.\n\n*Click on Manage profiles, and create a new profile that is the side of both videos placed next to each other, and with the correct aspect ratio.\n\n*Go back to the main screen, and for each track right-click on the clip, and then select the Video tab. Then set the horizontal alignment to be either left or right, depending on the track. Then apply changes.\n\n*When you go to export the video, make sure to use your custom profile.\n\n\nA: Gridplayer does the trick.

(i.e. sudo mdam --zero-superblock /dev/sd[fg]; sudo mdadm --create /dev/md/alpha --raid-devices=2 --level=1 --assume-clean --name=alpha /dev/sd[fg] )\n\nThe problem is that after reboot, despite adding ARRAY /dev/md/alpha metadata=1.2 name=omicron:alpha UUID=c66a267... to mdadm.conf, the named device file dissapears and is replaced with one of standard format. (/dev/md125 or similar)\nHow can I make a renamed mdadm array keep its name?\n- I.e. -\nHow can I make ubuntu persist the device files between boots?\n\nA: You have to give it the name actually with --name= like:\nsudo mdadm --assemble /dev/md/alpha --name=newname --update=name /dev/sd[gf]\n\nTo have a consistent behavior over reboot you have to use the same name in the --name argument than in the last part of the device.\nHere it would be : sudo mdadm --assemble /dev/md/alpha --name=alpha --update=name /dev/sd[gf]\nSee Khassad's post below for a full explanation.\n\nA: It's seems as if the answer you seek is right in the mdadm man page\n[create, build, grow]\n      -N, --name=\n          Set  a name for the array.  This is **currently only effective when creat‐\n          ing an array** with a version-1 superblock, or an  array  in  a  DDF  con‐\n          tainer.   The  name is a simple textual string that can be used to iden‐\n          tify array components when assembling.  If name is needed but not speci‐\n          fied, it is taken from the basename of the device that is being created.\n          e.g. when creating /dev/md/home the name will default to home.\n\nand for assemble\n       -N, --name=\n          Specify the name of the array to assemble.  **This must be the  name  that\n          was  specified  when  creating the array**.  It must either match the name\n          stored in the superblock exactly, or it  must  match  with  the  current\n          homehost prefixed to the start of the given name.\n\nWhich explains why the name attribute isn't sticky after it's set. If you did get it to work please ack with a comment which answer did the trick for you. Alternatively, you could always create symlinks using a udev rule and the array's UUID as an anchor.\nI don't see the point in adding the fake name to the /etc/mdadm.conf, you're already using the UUID which is the canonical array name. Adding another variable, that you see fit to change, is just unnecessary maintenance and asking for trouble e.g. array fails to start.\nBeyond these observations, the best place to go to understand why you just can't update the name at runtime is to ping the linux-raid mailing list.\n\nA: The way to make Ubuntu persist the name change across boots is to update your initramfs. After updating your array name and mdadm.conf, you need to issue the following command:\nsudo update-initramfs -u\n\nThe whole process:\nsudo mdadm --stop /dev/md125\nsudo mdadm --assemble /dev/md/alpha --name=alpha --update=name /dev/sd[fg]\nsudo mdadm -Db /dev/md/alpha\n\nThe third command should return something like:\nARRAY /dev/md/alpha metadata=1.2 name=omicron:alpha UUID=5b024352:3a940335:233aa23f:5c6b2a1f\n\nPaste the result into /etc/mdadm/mdadm.conf (replacing the old line). Or execute:\nsudo mdadm -Db /dev/md/alpha >> /etc/mdadm/mdadm.conf\n\nNext run:\nsudo update-initramfs -u\n\nFinally, reboot.\nThis discussion was useful.\n\nA: The first answer by pille and N.N works.\nThe trick here is that when you don't specify the --name option the only renaming done by mdadm is assigning the array name from the device number it has allocated. In this question it is 0 so the new array name is 0.\nSince you specify the device name (\"alpha\" here) to use in the assemble command it will create and use this device name.\nBut at autostart mdadm creates a device based on the name it sees in the superblock, that is 0 in this case, so the device name you specified in your assemble command is lost.\nTo make your name change sticky and coherent, you have to use the same name in the last part of your device name and in your new array name. In this case, for the device \"alpha\" you would have to use this command line :\nmdadm --assemble /dev/md/alpha --name=alpha --update=name /dev/sd[gf]\n\nYou could also change the hostname, to do this you have to explicitly declare it using the -name=<hostname>:<array_name> syntax.\nThis may be useful for example after a machine name change.\n\nA: after you change the name, did you try to update your mdadm.conf?\n mdadm --examine --scan --config=mdadm.conf >> /etc/mdadm.conf\n\n\nA: mdadm has a bug when raid volumes were internally created with a space in their name. These volumes won't mount correctly due to format error in the generated /etc/mdadm/mdadm.conf file. You need to rename them there but it won't be persistent.\nSo renaming the internal names is necessary... but it is not supported on all RAID controlers that block their metadata and don't support the name option.\nI don't see how to rename these volumes (even if they are internally referenced by their UUID, the names are those used by Linux; Windows on the opposite has no such bug and perfectly mounts RAID volumes containing spaces in their names) !\n", "Q: Is it possible to have different GTK+ theme in Unity and Gnome Shell?

I also can not right click in the desktop. How can I restore previous Nautilus and desktop. I am providing preview of Nautilus \n\n\nA: That \"ugly theme\" is the default GTK theme.\nThere are numerous fixes to be detailed but this is the best answer I know of.\n", "Q: Why are these directories called file systems? /proc, /usr, /var, /home are called file systems.\nWhat does that mean? i thought there was only one file system (e.g. ext4).. \n\nA: The term \"file system\" has several meanings. When people talk about the file system names like ext4, UFS, NTFS etc. they have in mind the organization of data storage at low level (in terms of blocks on media). Such \"file systems\" usually requires driver to access data stored on media formatted with that file system. In the case of /proc, /usr, root file system or something file system simply refers to a directory structure.\nTechnically in Linux any directory can be a mount point for file system. This allows you to select the best type of file system (ext4, ufs, xfs etc.) for individual directories, depending on the nature of the stored information and security requirements.\nI believe in your case those directories are called \"file systems\" because they are are often used as a mount point for individual file systems. /proc is always a mount point for the procfs pseudo-file system that presents information about processes and other system information in a hierarchical file-like structure.\nThere are a few directories which can be considered file systems: /dev, /sys and /tmp.\n\nA: /proc is a very special folder, and it is not stored on disk, but in memory and is used to give info about system (CPU, RAM, devices..). So it use a special File System (not ext4) that is called procfs. You can read more on Wikipedia: procfs\nInstead, /usr, /var and /home are generally (at least on a desktop computer) stored on the same file system (e.g. ext4), and often on the same disk: they are regular folders, with specific meanings. Always on Wikipedia you can find detailed info on Filesystem Hierarchy Standard.\nThey are not really \"file systems\", but this paragraph help explaning this naming usage (from FHS 2.3 reference):\n\nTo boot a system, enough must be present on the root partition to\n  mount other filesystems. This includes utilities, configuration, boot\n  loader information, and other essential start-up data. /usr, /opt, and\n  /var are designed such that they may be located on other partitions or\n  filesystems.\n\n\nA: You can think of a file system as a structure that allows files to be created in a data storage device.  The device is something like a hard disk partition, RAM or a USB stick, for example.  The file system type is the format used to store data in the file system, for example ext4, vfat or lots of others.  File systems (devices) can be mounted as directories (folders), also called mount points.\nTo run an OS, you must have a root file system, where the OS is installed.  This is mounted as / (root) during boot, and all other file systems are mounted under it.  From the examples you give, /usr and /var can be either part of the root file system, or separate file systems (a different partition in same or different drive as /).  If separate file systems, they can even be a different file system type than / (I think!).  On the other hand, /proc is a file system in RAM (also known as a RAM disk) with its own type with the same name, proc.\nThe mount command on a terminal gives you this information about all mounted file systems: device, mount point, type.  For instance:\nuser@box:~$ mount\n/dev/sda7 on /home type ext3 (rw,relatime,errors=remount-ro,commit=0)\nproc on /proc type proc (rw)\n\nThis means I have partition sda7 mounted as /home (with all my precious data!), and it is formatted with type ext3; device proc is mounted on /proc with type proc.  The permissions for each file system are also given (rw, etc).\nOne last point: file systems are often referred to by their mount points.  That is, in the example above I could say that device sda7 is my /home file system.  This is not strictly correct, although clear to most people: it means the file system is intended to be mounted with mount point /home.  But there's nothing stopping me from mounting the file system in sda7 under mount points /work, /hotel or /sunny_beach.  Indeed, the raw data can also be accessed directly under /dev/sda7 (mounted or unmounted) without knowledge of the underlying file system.  This can useful for data recovery in cases of file system corruption, when the file system can no longer be mounted but the device is still readable.  Such direct access is however potentially disastrous and should be used only in exceptional circumstances.\n", "Q: How to add custom links in the left pane of Nautilus?

Sure, the computers are connected to the Internet.\n\n*I have computers at home, and my other working places with Internet access.\n\n\nHow can I access the office machines with VPN without server with public IP from everywhere? Can you show me a complete tutorial?\n(I saw TeamViewer, Hamachi, but if it possible, I want to use a private VPN.)\nThank you very much!\n\nA: Any computer on the internet can be addressed by its IP address. Those IP address are commonly called \"public IP address\".\nInternet servers have public IP addresses.\nNowadays, desktop or laptop computers are typically not connected to the internet directly. They have internet access through a router using a technique called IP masquerading (or NAT). Using this scheme, computers get assigned a \"local IP address\" such as 192.168.., 172.16.. or 10...*. Those addresses are invalid on the internet. Only the router has a valid public IP address.\nA client with a local IP address (behind a router) can always establish an connection with a server using a public address (directly connected to the internet). That's why web browsing works perfectly.\nHowever, if both parties are behind such a router, i.e. none of the computers has a public IP address , establishing a connection is impossible.\nYou have several options:\n\n\n*\n\n*Establish the connection through a server (as it is done with TeamViewer)\n\n*Configure one of the routers to make incoming connections possible (port fowarding)\n\n*Establish a VPN. Minimum requirement is that one of the routers allows either port forwarding or supports some VPN (or connect through a third party server).\n\n\nPlease research the network situation of your office. Find out, whether your IP address is public and, if not, who controls the router. Then, ask whether port forwarding or a VPN is an option they can provide (or consult the manual if you have access to the router).\n\nA: The solution a server based VPN programe, eg.

In some cases if another client knows that temporary port, it could connect through it.\nCheck out STUN, TURN and ICE.\n\nA: You might be interested in VPN over the Internet without public IP when all the nodes are behind the NAT. Those connections are called F2F (Friend to Friend) or P2PVPN (Point to Point VPN). They might be fully decentralized or may require an initial connection broker like XMPP Jabber or Google Hangout (required only at the time of establishing connections between end hosts).

But this script can play audio when I execute it from terminal like this:\nsh bin/alarm.sh   \n\nI try to get output from either crontab or script, but to no avail.

If you know, please help me.\n\n\nA: The problem seems to be that mpd runs under user mpd per default (as a system daemon) and is thus unable to join your sessions' pulseaudio mixer, therefore it hogs the sound card output via alsa or even oss. In my answer, I assume that you are logged in and that the crontab is yours and not the system crontab.\nMPD\nDepending on your priorities, you have a lot of options that mostly circle around the idea teaching mpd to not hog the sound and use pulseaudio instead.

I can dim the screen, but it is still quite bright. What can I do on Ubuntu to do this? (Settings or software.)\n\nA: Redshift is a small program which allows to change display's color temperature according to time of day - i.e. make it more reddish in the night and blue-ish during the day.\nYou can see if setting a really low \"night\" color temperature produces a desired result.\nIf you want to set the color temperature manually, you can use the \"one shot\" mode of the program:\nredshift -o -t 3700:3700 -l 0.0:0.0\n\nand to reset the color temperature back:\nredshift -x\n\nIt is also possible to toggle day/night mode using the gtk-redshift indicator.\n\nA: This may not be exactly what you are looking for, but I use a program called f.lux to automatically lower the  color temperature of my screen after sunset. The temperature is configurable, and it knows when to activate itself by your latitude and longitude which you must input yourself.\nThere is also an open source program that provides the same function called redshift.

I'm not afraid of the terminal or anything else; I just don't usually know what to do without being explicitly told.\nI have the 64-bit version of 11.04, from the alternate installer, and am dual-booting with Windows 7. I'm using the 'Ubuntu Classic (no effects)' desktop option.\nThat said...\nManually installed (from tar.bz2, as opposed to .deb/Synaptic) programs (or possibly only manually installed Mozilla programs; I haven't tested other programs) don't seem to display their icons in the title bar, nor in the task bar.  An icon is shown, but it's only the default 'there is no icon' one. Currently, I'm having this problem with SeaMonkey and Thunderbird.\n\n\n*\n\n*SeaMonkey was originally installed through Synaptic (I can't remember if the icon showed then, but I don't believe it did.), then later uninstalled so I could manually install a non-buggy version, and has since been upgraded to the current 2.4.1.\n\n*Thunderbird was manually installed from the start, first the most recent version, then later downgraded to an older version. Since then, I have manually installed several versions, including the same one available through Synaptic, and also installed Thunderbird through Synaptic.  Currently, I have both the Synaptic and a fairly recent 6.something version installed, in different locations.  Only the Synaptic install shows the Thunderbird icon.  None of the other versions ever have, whether newer or older, so it's clearly not a version issue.\n\n\nAfter some time spent with Google, I found /chrome/icons/default in each program's folder, and all the necessary window icons seem to be there, but it doesn't look like the programs can find them. Why not? How can I fix this?\n\nA: Compiling programs from source normally doesn't add shortcuts and links for those programs on your user UI, mostly they will create a link to the compiled binary in /usr/bin so that the user can type the program's command on the terminal and start using it right away but icons, shortcuts on desktop, nice menu links are not included unless the program was made to do so after you compiled it.\nThe icons probably will be on the folder from the compiled application, its part of the source code most of the times and will be copied, but that doesn't mean that your install used to to create shortcuts and menus.\nPackages that come from apt or software center are designed to created such links and shortcuts using the icons supplied on the program of a theme icon for the application.\nThink of packages (deb, rpm, etc) as archives with instructions on where and how to create links, place configuration files, modify other files for integration. In Windows if you want to use a software you have to use and installer that will do the same (ie: if you install firefox in Windows) for you. The other option is to use compiled binaries without an installer, that means that the program is there, it will work perfectly but no links, shortcuts, integration will be done for you automatic.\nAn example of this is firefox and firefox portable, the first you download, run the installer that will create the files and links and will integrate the program with your OS, the 2nd will open, run, let you use the full program with no limitations but there is no links, no integration, no links, etc, you need to run the compiled binary and that's it.\nSo, if you want to have integration in to your Ubuntu desktop you need to use the pre-compiled, assembled packages (deb files, or installer files for Ubuntu/Debian), either by downloading them or using apt or you do everything by hand using source or compiled binaries for your system. The easiest and most common is to use the .deb files since they do all the nasty work for you.\n", "Q: Will I have to install those KDE libraries if I want to run some apps written in QT? I don't know much about QT and GTK+, but I've heard that QT is for KDE and GTK+ is for Gnome. Now I'm using Gnome and I want to use a C++ IDE. It's said that QT creator is a nice choice for c++ development so I decide to have a try. But I'm really worried about the incompatibility between QT and Gnome. Besides, I'm wondering whether it's normal to use qt creator in Gnome developing apps using GTK+ or not. And, QT and GTK+, which one is better for a ubuntu user?\n\nA: One of the goals of modern releases of Ubuntu, is to bring different environments closer together. For instance, Unity 2D uses Qt, but you won't consider it a non-Ubuntu application. You should choose GTK or Qt by the merits and features of the toolkits. In older versions of Ubuntu, Qt-applications will feel somewhat out of place, but in modern versions, they should blend in nicely. \nIndicators, the global menubar, etc, are specifically designed to be used by all kinds of different applications. They will work well with Qt apps, in Unity, KDE, LXDE, XFCE, etc. Except for the scrollbars, Firefox will look right at home in Ubuntu, for instance. \n", "Q: Internet connection with static IP I have installed ubuntu server 11.04 edition (with LAMP, mail server, and SSH server) and I try to connect to the internet.

I'm planning to buy a new LCD tv with Full HD and with HDMI inputs.

When I burn my tar file to a Brasero \"Data project\" the program seems to create a deliberately ambiguous date in a directory name.  For example the directory is called \"Data disc (03 Oct 11)\".  How can I burn my tar file without having it go into a DVD directory?  \nEdit  @brunopereira81 says that there is no actual DVD directory being created and he is correct.  However, gnome and Nautilus will see a linux path containing the ambiguous name even though that name is not a DVD directory.  As was suggested it is some sort of mount point.  I think it is a virtual device name that appears to browse like a linux directory.\n\nA: Are you sure that it is not just the mount point or the volume (disc) name???\nIf this is what you mean (where my tab is at the moment) you can delete that text and insert one that fits you better as a disc name (ie: \"MP3Collection\").\n\nI dont believe that brasero creates a folder if you are trying only to only add one file to it. \nHave a look here for a simple guide and if that is not your problem include a screenshot of what you are experiencing.\n\nA: Todays date is 03 October 2011. Since it is unlikely that you'll still use that CD in 2111, they figure it is unnecessary to specify the century, and it becomes 03 Oct 11.

This applies to both Windows and Ubuntu clients.\n\nI'm assuming you have  Windows on a C: partition and all other files on a D: (or other) partition? This is what I have set up and was looking for an answer, too.  I'm not sure how effective One will be with this limitation.\n\nA: Mounting a drive into a folder on your home directory will work.\nI mounted my fixed F: to an empty folder in my /Users/username/... directory using the directions listed here.\nUse this link to get to Drive Management in Windows 7.\nThat worked just fine. \n\nA: I don't think you can, for the same reasons you cannot sync files from other filesystems in Ubuntu. It is highly unlikely that C:\\ on Windows will suddenly disappear. It's equally unlikely that /home in Ubuntu will disappear. Consider a memory stick that's being synced. You need to rearrange your USB devices, so you disconnect it. You then log onto your system and the Ubuntu One client sees that your files are no longer present. Since it is synced, that means it will be deleted on all your other computers and from the web. That is not what you want, but that would be the only way to handle these things. Well ... \nIt's probably not impossible to find solutions to these kinds of issues, but synchronization is difficult enough when you know what's going on. When you don't know what's going on, as is the case with secondary filesystems, then it becomes very difficult. I would not expect this to be possible at least over the next versions, but then I'm also not a developer of that technology, so who knows. :)\nYou can try the following, but do so at your own risk... Have backup. \nIf you are the sole user of the system and D:\\ belongs only to you, then you can try to mount it in your home directory instead of as D:. That might work.

But they do consume large amounts of energy that could be better used for other things.\n", "Q: Can I somehow record my screen with whatever sound is coming from the speakers? I am watching a lecture conducted on Adobe Breeze. I find it too slow... usually when I watch videos (esp lectures), I speed up the playback with VLC. Saves time.\nSo how would I somehow convert/record the breeze presentation as a movie/video?\nGreat if I could work with my computer as usual without affecting the recording. Else I could just leave the recording on when I'm not using it.\n\nA: There is GNOME frontent to recordMyDesktop in standard repository. You can install it via Synaptic or by running sudo apt-get install gtk-recordmydesktop.\nNote, there is a nuance. If your sound not recorded try to change sound profile to Analog Stereo Output.\n\n\nA: You can use recordMyDesktop to record your desktop (both audio and video) for later share or view.\n\nA: I have been having the exact same issue, sorry to resurrect an old question, but the answers on here aren't quite usable on 13.10. So, I went messing about in the Pulse Audio controls and I figured out that there is a way to do this similar to what Sergey provided.\nYou can no longer go through the default sound settings, you have to change a setting within the PulseAudio Volume Control application. If you don't already have it installed you can run sudo apt-get install pavucontrol.\nAs for how to change the default sound going to wherever (I know it works with GTK-RecordMyDesktop), read on.\nYou have to actually have something recording audio, such as GTK-RecordMyDesktop, otherwise you can't access the setting that you have to change. Here's a screenshot of the PulseAudio Volume Control window prior to the start of the recording:\n\nNow, I started recording via GTK-RecordMyDesktop and you can see the screen has changed:\n\nYou have to change the drop-down menu from Built in Audio Analog Stereo to Monitor of Audio Analog Stereo and it should record the sound that goes to your speakers, at least it did for me. Beyond that it is an Intel sound card, I don't really know any details about my sound card, it's in an old Toshiba Satellite A105 laptop.\nHope this helps someone!\n\nA: For Ubuntu 14.04 through 16.04 I was able to achieve this by opening the Pulse Audio Volume Control and adjusting the settings on the Input devices as shown below, Changing the dropdown to Show Monitors and then clicking the green checkbox to \"Set As Fallback\" This worked for me as I never really use my Microphone. I would imagine that reverting settings would be necessary to use the microphone and if you are using HDMI audio for output for instance you'll need to choose the correct Monitor from the list for that.\n\n", "Q: How do I get an LG Lic-300 webcam working? I use Ubuntu 10.04LTS from the beginning, and throughout that time the only thing that could not succeed was that this webcam is recognized but not working:\n\nBus 005 Device 002: ID 0c45:60fc Microdia PC Camera with Mic (SN9C105)\n\nI use Ubuntu 10.04LTS 32bits and the kernel is 2.6.32-32-generic-pae.\nAs I've been reading recently, which could for the kernel, a new search and I did not find any documentation that satisfactory.\nIn http://mxhaard.free.fr/spca5xx.html - appears as the webcam support Test and driver: spca5xx/LE - just bought this webcam to work on Linux, taking the version 9.04 on all other it worked, but now 10.04LTS repeats in the case of Ubuntu 9.04.\n\nA: I have found this page with a generic driver for this webcam's chip, I know its old but its worth giving a shot.\nThe problem with Microdia cams is really drivers, there is a huge list of user asking for them and trying to make them work and a very small list of users that actually made these work without problems.\nThe page you refer to is mostly provided for Creative Live! cams and none of those packages supports your cam.\nYour device id (0c45:60fc) also does not show on the Ubuntu supported hardware list so it will be unlikely that you will this one working flawless anytime soon.\nFor a list of supported webcams in Ubuntu please have a look on this list.\n", "Q: How do I diagnose an onboard wired network interface that quit working? I have an installation of 10.10 that has been working fine since I upgraded.  One day I booted it and there was no network connectivity. The network indicator now says \"Networking disabled\". If I go to System > Administration > Network Tools > Devices the loopback is the default and though Eth0 shows up, if I select it everything is blank in the configuration and there is nothing in the interface statistics. lspci shows\n\nIntel Corporation N10/ICH 7 Family LAN Controller (rev 01)\n\nI have another card handy but would like to learn how to diagnose things like this.  For example Is there a software reason that a working card would just stop working?  Can the card be so visible but be totally broken? What steps can I try to \"Enable\" the card and networking or is there something that would point to hardware right off?\nUPDATE: It is now working but I would accept the best explanation that might help someone else of why it is working or why I'm still in trouble.\nOriginally the only thing that showed up in the network indicator was the disabled text and there was no \"Enable Networking\".  Based on another post I tried sudo dhclient eth0 though I have no idea what it does.  It returned an ip address and I could browse to specific local ips.  Then I rebooted to see what would happen and I had the same original problem so I did dhclient again but this time noticed that \"Enable Networking\" was now showing up in the indicator so I checked it. This time I rebooted and everything is working fine. But I still don't know why it stopped or why the steps I took worked.\n\nA: If I read your question correctly, then you are not asking how to fix this problem but how to diagnose networking problems like this.\n\n\n*\n\n*My advice is read through the documentation.\n\n\n*\n\n*Official Ubuntu documentation on Internet connections \n\n*Community documentation for trouble shooting wireless problems\n\n\n*Browse the links for networking problems on this site and the Ubuntu forums Networking and Wireless section. Notice the problems that people have and the advice given.\n\n*Run the commands on a working system (your own) and compare that output from the commands as a means of identifying the differences and working what these indicate the problem is.\n\n*From the advice given on the forums note which advice works and use it to develop diagnostic skills.\n\n\nThis is my method. Sometimes I get things right. You may find that you can notice things about the problem that others miss.  \n\nA: The shortest path is to try known working ethernet card. This advise assumes that your network is configured but not working.\nAfter your update I believe your card is not configured. sudo dhclient eth0 just configures your network interface from DHCP server in your LAN. May be you should try to assign static IP before moving on.\nTo try static IP you can type:\nsudo ifconfig eth0 192.168.0.101/24 and than ping other hosts in your network. Note that instead of 192.168.0.101 you have to specify IP from your LAN not included in DHCP pool.\nIf you don't know what address to specify run sudo dhclient eth0 again and then ifconfig eth0.\nTo make this settings persistant edit your /etc/network/interfaces file (see  man interfaces for details). \n\nA: Try typing this into a Terminal window:\nsudo ifconfig eth0 down\nsudo dhclient -r eth0\nsudo ifconfig eth0 up\nsudo dhclient eth0\n\n", "Q: Change XAMPP's htdocs web root folder to another one I'm trying to change the XAMPP's web root default directory /opt/lampp/htdocs to another one like /home/me/Dropbox/public_html without success.\nI've edited the file /opt/lampp/etc/httpd.conf\n# old line: DocumentRoot \"/opt/lampp/htdocs\"\nDocumentRoot \"/home/me/Dropbox/public_html\"\n\n#...etc...\n\n# old line: <Directory \"/opt/lampp/htdocs\">\n<Directory \"/home/me/Dropbox/Work/public_html\">\n#\n# Possible values for the Options directive are \"None\", \"All\",\n# or any combination of:\n#   Indexes Includes FollowSymLinks SymLinksifOwnerMatch ExecCGI MultiViews\n# etc...\n\nI've did this as said in this article: Using Ubuntu One to synchronise htdocs?\nThen I've restarted Apache and I've got a permission error 403 on every page I've called with the web browser.\nSo I've changed folder and files permission to 755.\nI've did this as said in this article: \nWhat file permissions should I set on web root?\nThe problem still remains the same, I have the 403 error on every page I try to reach with the web browser.\nI have the same problem on a Mac using XAMPP.\nSo everythig works fine if the folder remains the original /opt/lampp/htdocs.\nHow can I change it correctly?\n\nA: Had the same issue and here is what i did:\nRun this command to stop xampp:\nsudo /opt/lampp/lampp stop\n\nOpen /opt/lampp/etc/httpd.conf\nChange your_folder to the folder you wanna use\n DocumentRoot \"/home/username/your_folder\"\n <Directory \"/home/username/your_folder\">\n\nChange User & Group value from daemon to:\nUser nobody\nGroup nogroup\n\nset chmod to your_folder with this command\nsudo chmod 777 /home/username/your_folder\n\nSave the file and start xampp with this command:\nsudo /opt/lampp/lampp start\n\nOpen your browser and enter this url:\nhttp://localhost/your_folder/\n\nDone, hope this helps.\n\nA: Open /opt/lampp/etc/httpd.conf\nchange nobody and nogroup\n<IfModule unixd_module>\n#\n# If you wish httpd to run as a different user or group, you must run\n# httpd as root initially and it will switch.  \n#\n# User/Group: The name (or #number) of the user/group to run httpd as.\n# It is usually good practice to create a dedicated user and group for\n# running httpd, as with most system services.\n#\nUser nobody\nGroup nogroup\n</IfModule>\n\nto your username and your group\n\nA: The problem was on user group type in httpd.conf file which must be set to staff and then I don't need to change the folder permissions on the folder i'd like to use as web root.\n\nA: You can create a symbolic link \nln -s /home/username/public_html/ /opt/lampp/yoursymlink \n\nwith your username \"~username\" as symbolic link so you can keep the same URL location \nlocalhost/~username for files like if your were using default Apache server and not XAMPP.\n\nA: If you are doing this so that you can create files in htdocs folder then Just navigate to opt/lampp and then open in terminal and write \n\nsudo chmod 777 htdocs/\n\nThats it!\n\nA: Just solved it following the steps bellow:\n\n\n*\n\n*First install xampp by following steps\n$ sudo cd Downloads && sudo chmod a+x ./your-downloaded-xampp-file.run && sudo ./your-downloaded-xampp-file.run\n\n\n*Change file owner of /opt/lampp directory. username should be the username of your new documentroot folder ownername\nsudo chown -hR  username:root /opt/lampp\n\n\n*edit /opt/lampp/etc/httpd.conf\nsudo gedit /opt/lampp/etc/httpd.conf\n\n\n*edit your document root path to mounted windows documentroot and  the following lines\n<IfModule unixd_module>\n   User nobody\n   Group nogroup\n</IfModule>\n\n\n*restart xampp. And you will find forbidden error has gone\n\nA: Had the same problem under linux 18.3. None of the above worked exactly as described, but the following combination did:\nIn the file /opt/lampp/etc/httpd.conf I made the following changes:\nReplace:\n    <IfModule unixd_module>\n    User daemon \n    Group daemon\n    </IfModule>\n\nby:\n    <IfModule unixd_module>\n    User myusername \n    Group myusername\n    </IfModule>\n\nand further down replace:\n    DocumentRoot \"/opt/lampp/htdocs\"\n    <Directory \"/opt/lampp/htdocs\">\n\nby \n    DocumentRoot \"/home/myusername/webdir\" \n    <Directory \"/home/myusername/webdir\"\n\nThereby, \"myusername\" is my linux username, and \"webdir\" is the directory name in my home directory where the php-files are stored.  \nIn the terminal, stop lampp before saving the file, start again. In the browser localhost will then point to \"webdir\". \n\nA: Just make an index file on your new htdocs folder.\n\nA: In NTFS format you can't set folder permissions. Open /opt/lampp/etc/httpd.conf.\nEdit\nUser computerName\nGroup computerName\nAnd after that you can access the symbolic links in htdocs.\n", "Q: Desktop background \"freezes\" in Ubuntu 11.04 I'm experiencing an odd problem with my desktop, which I'm unable to find any solutions (or reproduces) on the web, partly because for any search terms I can think of, I come up with a lot of hits that don't relate to my problem...\nThe problem I'm seeing is that the desktop \"freezes\", so that what was shown on the desktop before is \"left there\" until something else is placed on top of it.

From what I understand, Transmission bittorrent client uses the miniupnp library to do it's UPnP port forwarding of routers, however on Ubuntu upnpc (a test client of the miniupnp library) doesn't find any IDG routers, while on another Windows machine on the same networks it works correctly (with the windows binary of upnpc).\nFrom what testing I've done, it seems that the M-SEARCH SSDP packet is not being sent onto the network, perhaps a firewall or something is stopping it.\nHow do I try and make sure these packets get though and this works?\n\nA: I just used upnp-router-control to add a port forwarding to my router and it worked like a charm :)\nIf that doesn't work for you i would suggest you use wireshark to analyze the network traffic and look where it hangs.\n\nA: Run in a shell to add config lines after fresh installed miniupnpd\necho \"MiniUPnPd_OTHER_OPTIONS=-N\nSTART_DAEMON=1\nMiniUPnPd_EXTERNAL_INTERFACE=eth0.4\nMiniUPnPd_LISTENING_IP=eth0.1\" | sudo tee -a /etc/default/miniupnpd; sudo service miniupnpd restart\n\nNote: eth0.4 and eth0.1 is my ext/int interfaces, use yours.\nCheck chains after UPNP aware program restart:\nsudo iptables -vnL MINIUPNPD ;sudo iptables -t nat -vnL MINIUPNPD\n\nShould show few rules\nAll tested on Ubuntu 13.10.\nAll files at /etc/miniupnpd/ just ignored.\n", "Q: System beeps on shutdown Very recently a couple of our systems have started making beeps on shutdown, we've not been able to isolate the exact time that they've been updated and it's occuring, but I've narrowed it down to being not pcspkr or snd_pcsp as both are blacklisted under modprobe, and rmmod'ed just to be sure. Now I'm a bit puzzled as I was under the impression those were the only two modules that could make the beep, is there a third lurking that I need to blacklist?\nEdit:\nI've copied the results of lsmod over on Pastebin.\n\nA: This doesn't answer why we get the problem but to fix it I ended up writing a Python script that uses amixer and alsactl to programatically tell ALSA to reduce volume to 0% and set mute for 'PC Beep', 'Beep' and 'PC Speaker'. It's not bullet proof, as I've found machines with PC speakers that have slightly different names, but it resolved the bulk of the problem. \n\nA: It could be unrelated to linux: FreeBSD and Windows users report this too; also some graphics cards come with beepers these days, so it may be an age / heat related issue.

You can install 'sysstat' to get the 'sar' command, but the granularity is only 10 minutes so it may not catch all the problems. Also you can login and run something like 'vmstat 5' which will print out stats about IO/load/memory every 5 seconds.\n100 is a lot for a small server if you are using Apache pre-fork (the default) with PHP.. since that will require 100 concurrent processes to satisfy the requests. If you have MaxClients set lower than 100, then the requests will backup in a queue, and go very slow. Thats probably preferrable to a total system crash though.\n", "Q: How can I change my Mic-in in port I am having Problem with my Mic-in port.

I know about crons, /etc/cron.d, /etc/cron.interval (interval = hourly|daily|weekly), /var/spool/crontabs/.\nMy question: is there an alternate to /etc/cron.d but user specific where i could just symlink these crons and they would be executed? I would prefer such a solution because these crons get updated at times from developers.\nOn #ubuntu ikonia suggested to google on how could one include crons, i did and couldn't find such a solution. If there could be place where i could do:\ninclude /var/www/domains/*/public_html/crontabs/crons\n\nthat would be totally awesome.\n[EDIT]\nI am open to changing the crons files a little.\n\nA: Root-level crontabs can be symlinked into /etc/cron.d/ . Everything in that folder is executed as root. It's possible for a root-level crontab entry to be executed as user-level, but that's a workaround and beyond the scope of the question. An example of such a symlink:\n# ln -s /path/to/crontab /etc/cron.d/\n\nUser-level crontabs cannot be created by symlink or any kind of direct file management - crontab management is specifically designed to prevent users from doing that. All user-level crontabs must be created using the 'crontab' command, so that all user-level crontabs get checked for syntax, and get spooled in the same place.\nHappily, the 'crontab' does more than merely open an editor. The command will accept entire files. For example, for the user owning $DomainName,\n$ crontab /var/www/$DomainName/public_html\n\nSo it should be quite easy to add a user-level crontab to the webapp startup script.\nIn Ubuntu 16.04 and newer, cron jobs are slowly being replaced by  systemd timers, but that's also beyond the scope of the question.\n\nA: On my web server, I give every virtual server a own linux user. Every linux user has its own crontab.\n", "Q: Why is 'gedit' going back to default tab sizes all the time?

I am presuming that at this late stage in development, the default file system of 11.10 will not change from now until final release. Will it be ext4, and if/when it changes, how will systems on the old format upgrade, in their current state, or changing the entire parition?\n\nA: Oneiric is past feature-freeze - there is no chance that the one of the fundamentals such as the file-system will change at this stage.\nGiven past experience of LTS's - these tend to be very conservative - i.e. incremental change - thus very unlikely to again change file-system - again many people are speculating about 12.10 which could involve major changes such as Wayland.\nThere was at one time much talk of btrfs being the replacement for ext4.  Btrfs is maturing with time - with support gradually being added - for example - update-manager in oneiric now has btrfs support.\nAs to how we would migrate from ext4 to btrfs - there is already support to convert from ext4 to btrfs by installing the package btrfs-tools.  This will install btrfs-convert which can convert ext4 to btrfs.\nAssuming Canonical makes the decision in (for example) 12.10 - expect to see a blue-print which will outline using these packages to provide a smooth migration path.\n\nA: When I first installed Ubuntu the default file system was ext3. I am now using 11.04 on the same / partition and /home partition and the file system for both partitions is still ext3. An upgrade will not change the file system type.\nA new install will change the file system type if you allow it to use the default settings as is proved by a new 11.04 and 11.10 install on two other partitions. The file system on those two partitions is ext4.\nIt is called being backward compatible.\nRegards.\n", "Q: Connecting to a secure webdav server through https I'm trying to connect to a secure WebDAV server but I keep getting the error \"org.freedesktop.DBus.Error.NoReply\"\n\nDBus error org.freedesktop.DBus.Error.NoReply: Did not receive a\n  reply.

So what's kmenuedit's secret updater code doing, and how can I call it from command line (specifically, an installation script)?\nThis is in Linux Educacional 4, which is based on Ubuntu 10.04 with KDE 4.4.5.\nSome things which haven't worked: \n\n\n*\n\n*Using xdg-desktop-menu, touching the files in /etc/xdg/menus, running kbuildsycoca.\n\n\nA: OK, for me what worked was: \nTake the applications-kmenuedit.menu file generated the first time you do a save inside KMenuEdit, clean up the \"bogus\" entry (or whatever change needed to get KMenuEdit to actually save a file there), and then copy that into either /etc/xdg/menus or ~/.config/menus. Magic file: bah!\n\nA: The place where it stores the menu files are usually in /usr/share/menu or /usr/share/applications.\nThose are the standard places.\n\nA: I also had a problem with my KDE menu. This occurred after I installed the Openbox desktop to test etc. For some reason I lost my menu list of applications after I returned to the Plasma desktop. \nI therefore removed the Openbox desktop via muon but still had the problem. I then went to /etc/xdg/menus and found an entry for Openbox still present. I then removed obconf, the preference manager for Openbox, via the muon package manager and this fixed the problem.\nI hope this helps.\n", "Q: How do I mv or cp a *.u1conflict file Ubuntu One is putting files in conflict while I'm working on them.

If I delete the conflict file I'm unable to create a new file with the original name. \nHow do I rename the file, and how do I prevent U1 from messing with my files that are in use?\n\nA: Just change to the directory of the file and rename it to the original name without the .u1conflict extension.\nor\nIf that doesn't work, turn off ubuntu one sync then change it.\nMoving the file should be easy enough.\n", "Q: Problem with grub to dual-boot in raid system I've got two HDs in a raid system and Windows 7 installed in a partition.

I can't find the 'shut down' option anywhere...\n\n\nA: By default, there's no shutdown entry in the status menu and you must press and hold Alt to be able to shutdown your computer when using GNOME Shell. But this can be changed by installing Alternative Status Menu extension which adds \"Power off\" and \"Hibernate\" to the status menu, visible at all time (and not just when pressing the ALT key). Install it:\nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:webupd8team/gnome3\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get install gnome-shell-extensions-alternative-status-menu\n\nSource: http://www.webupd8.org/2011/10/things-to-tweak-after-installing-ubuntu.html\n\nA: You have to press the Alt key while menu is open, to show the Power Off... option.\nI know, that’s a weird decision from GNOME Shell designers...\nSee cheat sheet for GNOME Shell at GNOME Wiki.\n", "Q: Why is sudo -s better than sudo su? I’ve seen many comments here in Ask Ubuntu regarding preference in using sudo -s rather than sudo su.\nFor me, that two commands do exactly the same. But why is sudo -s supposed to be better?\n\nA: Aside from the already mentioned differences with environment variables, I find sudo su silly and wasteful because you are asking sudo to run su as root, and ask it to run a shell as root.  Why ask a program to ask a program to give you a root shell, when you can just have the first program give you that shell?  Does that matter in any practical sense?  No, I'm just pedantic.\n\nA: I would disagree with other answers when considering the cases when you want to log in as a user who do not have a shell. That is a very common case with users assigned to services.\nUsing \"sudo su\" will start the shell specified by the user. However in the case of a user assigned to server process, the shell is /usr/bin/false and the logging will fail. Instead you should enter as:\nsudo -sHu <server-user>\n\nthat will log you in and cd to its home path, even if the user does not have a shell assigned\n\nA: I think sudo -s is not \"better\", it's just different.\nsudo -s\nkeeps your $HOME directory, so when you start programs, they will use your (and not root's) config files etc. Disadvantage: they can also change the ownership of your files in the $HOME directory, typical example is the .Xauthority file, but I have never experienced a problem with that.\nsudo su or sudo -i\nprograms will use the root's home directory and its config files. This might be more intuitive, but it also means that it will not use any configuration you may have set for yourself (aliases, bash history,...). \n\nA: Because sudo -s will not change your environment variables, especially $HOME, which will stay HOME=/home/USER. If you use sudo su this will change to HOME=/root which can have negative side effects when programs you start try to access your user's home directory.\nSo basically it's like sudo vs gksudo when running graphical programs.\n", "Q: Are there any fax sending applications?

It is same with touchpad.\n\n*Scrolling up and down in web browser and terminal changes noise. \n\n*I do not hear noise from internal speaker. It comes only from headphone.\n\n*Unplugging the laptop adapter from socket changes noise level to more lower level but again it is still there. I use a grounded socket.\n\n*It does not change anything.\n\n*This is my work computer so I do not use Home Theater, TV or Speakers.\nThis problem also occurs on Windows, so this mean it is not software or driver related. It is most likely a hardware error, cable problem or grounding problem. And bounty goes to Luis Alvarado.\n\nA: I got the same problem on my desktop computer and I tried to restart the sound server as per link.\nSimply executing pulseaudio -k in the terminal will restart the sound server.  This solves my problem and it may solve your problem too.\n\nA: The problem can be from several factors which can be related to the Ubuntu system, hardware of the PC, cables used to connect to the sound (Headphone, Cable PC-to-TV, etc..) or the actual device that is connected to the PC (TV, Big Speakers, Home theater systems)\nHere are the steps to check who has the fault. Let us start with Ubuntu (From the Inside to the Outside).\n\n\n*\n\n*Open the terminal and type alsamixer:\n\nUsing the ARROWS lower the PCM Bar while listening to the buzzing sound. Start lowering the rest of the bars to see which one starts changing the buzzing sound. If you find that one of the bars starts lowering the buzzing sound you have found the problem. If not let's continue.\n\n*Buzz Test #1 - Leave the mouse still and wait for the buzz. When the buzz starts go to the sound options menu:\n\n\nAfter opening the Sound Settings Window did the buzz stop?. If yes we have a clue how to stop it and we continue. If no we continue. Also check how many seconds passed after closing the Sound Setting Window did the buzzing start again.\n\n*Buzz Test #2 - Move the mouse around the screen. Does the buzz start sounding differently while moving the mouse?. Does it do the same with a Wireless mouse, usb mouse and the internal touchpad mouse?. If yes we have a clue to how to stop it and we continue. If no we continue.\n\n*Open a webpage or the terminal and start scrolling up or down with the arrow keys. Does the buzzing sound change?. If yes you have another clue. If not we keep going.\n\n*Do you hear the sound from the internal speakers or only when you connect a device that uses a cord/cable to plug in the PC (Headphone cable, PC-to-HomeTheater cable, PC-to-TV cable, Any cable actually)? If you do not hear it from the internal speakers and only from the cables you might be getting cable noise. This does not mean that cable noise is the only problem but it may add to the whole buzzing problem. Info for this hear: http://www.capgo.com/Resources/Measurement/Noise/Noise.html\n\n*Unplug the power cable. Do you hear the buzzing sound. Did it disappear completely?. If yes you have a clue. If not your Mr. Detective insides suck for a clue game. And we continue...\nNOTE: If you DO NOT hear a buzzing sound after unplugging the power cable from the laptop then you have a grounding problem. Remember this:\nThis is the correct grounding socket:\n\nThis is the wrong ugly NOT grounding socket (more like sewer water socket):\n\nSo remember kids, connecting your PC to a NON-Grounding Socket is giving the PC Aids. Wear a condom, give it a GROUNDING SOCKET!... and plant a tree..for dogs.\nMORE INFO - http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AC_power_plugs_and_sockets\n\n*Move the cable that is connected to the PC around. Does the buzzing sound change?. Roll the cable around your hand until you have it into circles. Does the buzzing sound change?. Remove any other cables around the sound cable you are using. what happens to the buzzing sound. Change the sound cable for another one. How is the buzzing sound?\n\n*Does the Home Theater, TV or Speakers you connect the laptop to make an unusual buzzing sound all by themselves (Without connecting them to the laptop at all). Get the volume to the max in the setting that is suppose to be for the computer. For example in a TV you would set the \"Source\" to PC. In a Home theater the have a button that sets the input sound to the PC or Aux. For the speakers you just need to have them unplugged from the PC and just put the volume to the max. Do any of this start making a buzzing sound, maybe lighter than the actual buzzing problem but still coming from this devices?. If yes you have yet another clue. If no we keep going.\nWith this tests you might have a inside as to where the problem might be. If you get more clues from when testing the software the problem might be old hardware, the cables inside the laptop that take care of sound, keys pressed and data in general or a driver issue. Basically you might have hardware problems, software problems or both.\nIf you get more clues from moving the mouse around the answer might be changing the cable.\nIf you get a clue from unplugging the power cable from the Laptop then your problem is grounding the laptop correctly. Yet other factors might also add to the buzzing effect.\nIf you get more clues from the actual device that outputs the sound (TV, Home theater, Speaker System) then that might be the problem.\nFor correct electrical grounding follow this tips:\n\n\n*\n\n*Never use two wire \"extension\" cords.\n\n*Never use extension cords with non-polarized plugs or ones with broken off ground pins.\n\n*Never break off the ground pin on electric equipment.\n\n*If necessary, always use a suitable ground adapter... and if possible, ground that extra wire on the ground adapter.\n\n*If no ground exists... find one... but make sure it is ground.\n\n*Always check the integrity of a \"strange\" power plug with a ground monitor device... if it checks \"bad\" don't plug into it!!!\n\n*Always use a qualified electrician to do all your \"wiring.\"\n\n\nCONCLUSION - If in MOST cases you DO have a buzzing sound, this is because (most probably) electrical (not grounding the PC) problems. If it is not a grounding problem, at least with this tests you have a easier chance to finding out what it is since you just checked the whole system (and even the kitchen sink)\n", "Q: Show hidden .htaccess files by default I was wondering if there is some method to display .htaccess files by default in every folder i create it.\nIs it possible to exclude .htaccess files from the hidden files?\nMaybe from the terminal\n\nA: You can set an alias to ls so that it will always list 'dot' files; the syntax varies a bit depending of the shell used; for bash it is:\nalias ls='ls -a'\n\nAdd the above line to your ~/.bashrc. The drawback is this will list all files starting with a dot, every time.\n\nA: You can use Ctrl+H if you are browsing files using Ubuntu File Browser (Nautilus)\n\nA: In linux, every file with a \"dot\" in the start of its name is treated as hidden file. Being hidden is not some property that you can remove from a file, thereby excluding that file from hidden files. If you want to unhide a file, you need to change its name i.e if you want to remove .somefile from hidden files, you rename it to somefile. But I dont think that you can do the same with .htaccess because its a configuration file and if you rename it to htaccess your webserver will still be looking for .htaccess.\nSo, in short, I don't think it is possible to exclude .htaccess files from hidden files.\n\nA: If you wanted only to show the the .htaccess dot file but keep the rest hidden you could add an alias to your bash configuration file for ls that uses grep to filter out the non-htaccess dotfiles.\nalias ls='ls -a | grep \".*([.]htaccess$)|.*\\d{2}:\\d{2} ([^.].*$)|.*$\"'\n\nThat regular expression is not working by the way, maybe someone with more experience could write the correct solution.

I could of course just mount /dev/mapped/drive /var but then I'm sure a lot of processes will get confused as to why their old open file descriptors cant speak to their newly created ones.\nIs there a way to basically restart the whole system without having to reboot or do I have to try to figure out which processes are running and /etc/init.d/* restart them manually?\n\nA: It should be possible but may not be worth the hassle, reboot being the most feasible option.\n/var may also contain a database like mysql, various log files and caches. You may have some success doing a lsof | grep /var/ and sending a stop to the related services and most of them may even survive a mv /var /varold && mkdir /var && mount -t auto /dev/whatever /var && cp -Rp /varold /var because they will just stick to their old pid files, but that may crash utterly.\nAnother approach would be to log in to the server with an account other than root and do a killall -SIGSTOP -u root (or whatever special user they may be running as), do your modifications and resume the processes with killall -SIGCONT -u root. \nIf this is really mission critical with no downtime and unlimited effort allowance, I would rather setup a cloned virtual machine and mess with that before trying this at the real server.\n", "Q: Will Gnome 3 be in 11.10?

I am having a really hard time getting ddclient (which updates OpenDNS with my current IP address) to work.

In older versions it was easy to create a launcher on my desktop. All I had to do is right click on my desktop and select the \"create launcher\" option.\nHow can I create such launchers now?\n\nA: How to create both a Desktop shortcut AND a Unity Dash / Gnome dock (\"start menu\") icon option using one .desktop file and two symlinks\n(Tested in Ubuntu 14.04, 16.04, 18.04, and 20.04).\nIn this example we will make a launcher for Arduino v1.8.5. The executables were previously extracted into this folder: \"~/Downloads/Install_Files/Arduino/arduino-1.8.5\". The main executable file to launch the application is stored at \"~/Downloads/Install_Files/Arduino/arduino-1.8.5/arduino\".\nFollow my example below, updating all steps as necessary for your application, including modifying the .desktop file contents as required.\nMy strategy will be to create a single .desktop file to act as the \"master\" launcher for the program, then we will create two symbolic links (symlinks) to this file to allow us to launch the program (1) via an icon on your Desktop, and (2) using the Unity or Gnome Application launcher search menu.\nQ: Why do it this way?\nA: Well, it allows you to only have to edit a single .desktop file to make changes to the shortcuts in both places at once.\nQ: Why not just do the .desktop file directly on the Desktop and then make a single symlink for the Unity/Gnome application launcher?\nA: because this way the .desktop file sits safely in a different folder where you and your kids won't accidentally delete it from the Desktop, so you know it won't get accidentally modified or deleted.\nSTEPS:\n1. Make a launcher (.desktop file), using a text editor of your choice, editing it as required. Store it in \"~/Desktop_launchers/Arduino_1_8_5.desktop\".\nHere are the commands, with me using the \"leafpad\" GUI text editor:\nmkdir ~/Desktop_launchers\nsudo apt update && apt install leafpad\ncd ~/Desktop_launchers\nleafpad Arduino_1_8_5.desktop\n\nCopy and paste the following into the \"Arduino_1_8_5.desktop\" file you just created.\n\n*\n\n*Note that my home (\"~\") directory is \"/home/gabriels\". Modify it below for your username.\n\n*Also note that for Exec paths with spaces, you must use the single quotes (') around the path name below, or else you will get an \"error launching the application\" when you click on the run link.\n\n*For the Icon path, however, even if it has spaces in the path, you must not use the single quotes around the path or else the icon won't properly show up on the link.\n\nArduino_1_8_5.desktop file contents:\n[Desktop Entry]\nName=Arduino 1.8.5\nComment=\nExec=/home/gabriels/Downloads/Install_Files/Arduino/arduino-1.8.5/arduino\nIcon=/home/gabriels/Downloads/Install_Files/Arduino/arduino-1.8.5/lib/arduino.png\nTerminal=false\nType=Application\nStartupNotify=true\n\nSave and exit.\n2. Make it executable.\nNote: this step is important! You must do this BEFORE creating the symbolic link in the next step below or else the symbolic link you're about to create won't work properly as a shortcut to launch the program from your Desktop.\nchmod +x Arduino_1_8_5.desktop\n\n3. Make a symbolic link to your above .desktop launcher on the Desktop so you can launch it from there:\nCommand Format: ln -s /path/to/file /path/to/symlink_to_make\nln -s ~/Desktop_launchers/Arduino_1_8_5.desktop ~/Desktop/Arduino_1_8_5.desktop\n\nNote that ending your symlink with \".desktop\" is mandatory or else it won't display or work properly as a Desktop shortcut.\n4. Make a symbolic link to it on the Unity/Gnome Applications menu so you can launch it from there too:\nsudo ln -s ~/Desktop_launchers/Arduino_1_8_5.desktop /usr/share/applications/Arduino_1_8_5.desktop\n\nNotes:\n\n*\n\n*Ubuntu Unity/Gnome application .desktop files are stored in: \"/usr/share/applications\"\n\n*Side note to add to your general knowledge: the .desktop files in the applications directory, unlike on the Desktop, don't need to be marked executable to work.\n\n5. Done!\n\n*\n\n*Now if you ever need to update the desktop file, update it directly in only one place: \"~/Desktop_launchers/Arduino_1_8_5.desktop\", and the changes will automatically be recognized by the symlinks on the Desktop and in \"/usr/share/applications\".\n\n*If the Desktop icon doesn't update after changing it, click on the Desktop then hit either F5 or Ctrl + R to refresh the Desktop icons.\n\n*To remove the shortcuts simply delete the symlinks from the Desktop and from \"/usr/share/applications\" as follows:\n\n*rm ~/Desktop/Arduino_1_8_5.desktop\n\n*sudo rm /usr/share/applications/Arduino_1_8_5.desktop\nScreenshots:\nMy Desktop with the newly-created shortcut:\n\nThe Unity Launcher menu with the newly-created shortcut:\n\nAdditional Reading:\nFor additional knowledge and alternate techniques, see the Official Ubuntu Documentation on \"UnityLaunchersAndDesktopFiles\" here: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/UnityLaunchersAndDesktopFiles\nSee Also:\n\n*\n\n*My eRCaGuy_dotfiles project, including my sample Desktop_launchers with desktop_file_install.sh and desktop_file_uninstall.sh scripts.\n\n\nA: There is cooler way: \nArronax\n\n\nOriginal picture taken from iloveubuntu.net which currently inaccessible\nTo install, type open a terminal with Ctrl+Alt+T and write:\n\nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:diesch/testing \nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get install arronax\nnautilus -q\n\nThis is cooler because it has drag&drop and more functions with a GUI.\nMore about Arronax on ubuntugeek.com.\n\nA: Considering previous answer by Scaine , the gnome-panel way installs dependencies, but at the very bottom of things - we don't really need those, we just need to have .desktop files created. Thus , I've put a small script that does exactly that, the graphical way, creating a named .desktop file in the ~/Desktop folder, readily available for use and pinning to the Unity launcher.  Not the best scripting here, but does the job. \nThis can be saved as file named makeLauncher.sh , change permissions from Right Click -> Properties -> Permissions -> Allow executing file as program, and it's ready to go.\n#!/bin/bash\n\nFORM=$(zenity --forms \\ --title=\"Simple shortcut maker\" --text=\"Create new .desktop file\" \\\n        --add-entry=\"Program Name\" \\\n        --add-entry=\"Command or path to file\" \\\n        --add-entry=\"Terminal app(true/false)\" \\\n        --add-entry=\"Icon (path)\") \n\n[ $? == 0 ] || exit 1\n\nawk -F'|' -v home=\"$HOME\" '{ \n    FILE = home\"/Desktop/\"$1\".desktop\"\n        print \"[Desktop Entry]\" >> FILE\n        print \"Type=Application\" >> FILE\n        print \"Name=\"$1 >> FILE\n        print \"Exec=\"$2 >> FILE\n        print \"Terminal=\"$3 >> FILE\n        if ($4 !~ /^[ ]*$/)\n            print \"Icon=\"$4 >> FILE ;\n    system(\"chmod 755 \" FILE);\n\n}' <<< \"$FORM\"\n\nAnd here's how it looks\n\nSide note: sadly, zenity's form field doesn't have checkbox for a forms widget, so the true/false for Terminal app option has to be typed. I am considering rewriting this script in PyQt. \n\nA: No longer works in latest version, desktop icons were completely removed.\nThis Is a solution to get it back on the right click menu In Gnome and Unity, \n1- Install gnome-tweak-tool , if you don't already have it,\nIn terminal paste-  \nsudo apt-get install gnome-tweak-tool\n\n2- Then type the following to launch it\ngnome-tweak-tool\n\nOr use the key shortcut Alt+F2 type gnome-tweak-tool then click \"Run\"\n3- Navigate to the \"Desktop\" tab on the left pictured - And turn ON\n\"Have file manager handle the desktop\" \n\n4-Source for this part: 1 Now we are going to create a Script to put on the right click menu -\nOpen gedit either by terminal or Alt+F2, Paste the code\ngnome-desktop-item-edit ~/Desktop/ --create-new\n\nput only this into the new text document and then save it as \"Create New Launcher\" no extension needed (you may need to use .sh as extension ex \"Create New Launcher.sh\", if you can't make it executable in the next step).\n5- Now we need to make the file executable, Right click on the file go to > Properties > click Permissions tab > look for \"Execute\" and check \"Allow executing file as program\" then close out.\n6- Open the file browser, go to > View > Show Hidden Files, now navigate to you home folder, and Place the file in ~/.gnome2/nautilus-scripts . Shown below - \n\n7- Now we have Create new launcher on the right click menu! Right click on your desktop and go to  > Scripts > Create New Launcher\nThen fill in the comand information for the application you want,\nShown below-\n\nIf you forget what the app's launch command is click \"Browse\" then navigate to File System > usr > bin  which is /usr/bin , these are the applications on your system, most should automatacally find the icon after you click \"Open\" , although they won't show up before. \nIf It dosn't show the icon when you get back to the \"Create Launcher\" box you can drag a icon in by finding the icon in /usr/share/icons . \nThere are default icons in the various theme folders or specific icons in the /usr/share/icons/hicolor/scalable/apps or /usr/share/icons/hicolor/48x48/apps, or if later you want to put an icon in you can right click > properties to drag and drop the icon in.\n(This part only for gnome, alt+f2 is diffrent in unity) Another way to list known applications is to hit Alt+F2 and click on the app under \"Show list of known applications\", you can then copy the command text for that program to paste in to\nCreate New Launcher. \n\nAll this will make it extremely easier to make custom launchers, and once setup you can make them without the terminal.\n\nA: *\n\n*Create the .desktop file in /usr/share/applications/\ngksudo gedit /usr/share/applications/give-any-name.desktop\n\n\n*Paste the following text\n[Desktop Entry]\nType=Application\nTerminal=false\nIcon=/path/to/icon/icon.png\nName=give-name-here\nExec=/path/to/file/executable\nCategories=Utility;\n\nGive to Name the name you want.\nAs for Icon and Exec, use either a full path or a \"system\" name. For example, the VLC video player icon is either /usr/share/icons/hicolor/48x48/apps/vlc.png or simply vlc (without the .png extension).\nFor Categories, consult the XDG Standards list.\n\nA: I have developed a little command line program for launchers creation. Example:\niconize -n \"Sublime Text\" -p /home/marco/Desktop/sublime/sublime -i /home/marco/Desktop/sublime/Icon/256x256/sublime_text.png\n\nIt will create a corresponding desktop entry inside ~/.local/share/applications:\n[Desktop Entry]\nType=Application\nName=Sublime Text\nExec=/home/marco/Scrivania/sublime/sublime %U\nIcon=/home/marco/Scrivania/sublime/Icon/256x256/sublime_text.png\n\nYou can then move it to your desktop like this:\nmv ~/.local/share/applications/sublime-text.desktop ~/Desktop\n\nMore powerful alternatives are Alacarte and MenuLibre (they have more functions and a graphical user interface).\n\nA: \nNote: gnome-desktop-item-edit was removed from gnome-panel in 19.10 (see gnome-desktop-item-edit: command not found on Ubuntu 19.10 and later even with the 'gnome-panel' package installed). So, this answer is unlikely to work for 19.10 and later.\n\nThe old GUI dialog is still available if you still want to use this:\nUsing ALT+F2 type\ngnome-desktop-item-edit --create-new ~/Desktop\n\nThis will launch the old GUI Dialog and create a launcher on your Desktop:\n\nPrerequisites\ngnome-desktop-item-edit is installed automatically if you have installed gnome-shell/gnome-fallback.  It is also installed automatically if you have previously installed gnome-tweak-tool.\nAlternatively, you can install the old gnome-panel without much of the bulk:\nsudo apt-get install --no-install-recommends gnome-panel\n\nYou can later move the MyLauncher.Desktop file from ~/Desktop to ~/.local/share/applications/ to make it appear in all applications dashboards, or to /usr/local/share/applications to make it available to all users (Thanks to @JonBently's comment).\nEDIT: ubuntu 22.04+ the app is called gnome-tweaks ..... 28-07-2022\n\nA: please be aware of this wiki page I've made, because I've noticed that questions on desktop and unity launchers are very often :) https://help.ubuntu.com/community/UnityLaunchersAndDesktopFiles\n\nA: This can be easily be achieved using nautilus-action & gnome-desktop-item-edit. \nSTEPS:\n\n\n*\n\n*Install nautilus-action by running following command in terminal:\nsudo apt-get install nautilus-action\n\n\n*Launch Nautilus-Actions and create a new action.\n\n*Under the Action tab, check on \"Display item in location context menu\", then in Context label, enter this: Create Launcher.\n\n\n\n*\n\n*Open now the Command tab and enter the following details:\nLabel: Create Launcher\nPath: gnome-desktop-item-edit\nParameters: --create-new %f\nWorking directory: Click Browse and select your Desktop folder.\n\n\n*Leave rest of the tabs as it is.Save now your command and exit:\n\n\n*Restart Nautilus:\nnautilus -q\n\n\n*You can add shortcuts from the context menu by selecting Create Launcher \n\n\nThe shortcut is added in your current directory you right-click on\nDONE!\n\nA: Use gnome-shell extension:\nI found the Add to Desktop GNOME Shell extension that gives a far easier and quicker way to create shortcuts, it works perfectly for me.\nNOTE: Tested on Ubuntu 18.04 and 20.04\nThis extension adds a new line in the app context menu of the 'Show Applications' section, this new line ('Add to Desktop') if clicked automatically creates the shortcut on the desktop.\nUsing Show Applications is very handy because all the apps are already listed there, you can stop searching for your app in multiple directories.\n\nA: You can do it manually. Make a new text-file named something.desktop and write this in there:\n#!/usr/bin/env xdg-open\n\n[Desktop Entry]\nVersion=1.0\nType=Application\nTerminal=false\nExec=command to run here\nName=visible name here\nComment=comment here\nIcon=icon path here\n\nDon't forget to make the file executable (chmod +x something.desktop)\nOR click right mouse button on that label and select 'Allow launching'\n(Tested in Ubuntu 19.04).\n\nA: An easier way to create a launcher for a program:\nIf you can find the program in your dash, just click and drag the icon for the program in your dash onto your desktop or wherever else you would like it. :)\n\nA: In 14.04 / 15.10 / 16.04 /17.04 / 17.10 To create a shortcut on the desktop to an existing application: the simplest solution (not found in the other answers as far as I can see) is to copy the application's desktop file to the Desktop: go to /usr/share/applications,right click on the application's desktop file >copy, go to your desktop, right click >paste. Don't forget to make it executable, its correct icon will appear after you made it executable.\nSimply drag and drop the icon from Dash on to the Desktop does not work in 14.04.\n\nA: Make a file called something.desktop, open it in gedit and type:\n[Desktop Entry]\nName=Launcher Name\nComment=Launcher Comment\nExec=Command to Execute\nTerminal=false\nType=Application\nIcon=Path to Icon\n\nPut this is /usr/share/applications and when you run it right click the app in the Unity Launcher and tick \"Keep in launcher\" (if you want it in the Unity Launcher), or just put it on your desktop if you want a Desktop launcher.\nPut this file in ~/.local/share/applications if you want to apply this to your user.\nJurriaan has made a graphical python app to do all this for you, it can be downloaded here: http://jurschreuder.nl/UnityLaunchCreator.tar.gz\n\nA: I've noticed that both gnome-panel and gnome-tweak-tool need a load of dependencies, even with --no-recommends.\nThe method I've used so far is to choose an arbitrary icon from the Dash, such as Firefox, and drag it to the desktop. You can't drag a icon from the Launcher, it doesn't let you. So it has to be the Dash, so press the Super (or Windows) key on your keyboard to launch the Dash, make sure it's not fullscreen (toggle it with the button at the top-left), then drag any icon at all onto your desktop.\nThen right-click on the new desktop icon and change the path, description, icon (and comment if you like). Then  drag this new launcher to somewhere like /home/yourname/Misc/Apps and finally, from there, drag it to the Launcher.\nNote : If you drag the file from the Desktop to the Launcher directly, then delete the Desktop file, the Launcher entry will stop working, even though it looks fine. I assume it makes some kind of shortcut to the original which you've just deleted.\n\nA: Install \"Create Launcher\" from the Ubuntu Software Center. You can search this name to find it there. See also:\nLink - Ubuntu apps directory\n\nA: On Ubuntu 20.04, this can be done without installing any (third-party) extension, although you need some manual work.\nGo to /usr/share/applications, copy the desktop file of the application which you want to add, to your home's Desktop folder (~/Desktop).\nYou will find the file added to the desktop. Then, right-click on the file and click on Allow launching. After that, you can double-click on the icon to launch the application.\n\n\nA: Go to : /usr/share/applications\nAnd do : sudo gedit\nIn the notepad paste :\n#!/usr/share/applications your-application\n[Desktop Entry]\nVersion=1.0\nType=Application\nTerminal=true/false*based on the appearance you want to make*\nExec=*the command*\nName=name-of-your-application\nComment=some-comment\nIcon=some-icon\n\nSave it as your-application, for example codium.desktop or any style that is normal as in /usr/share/applications.\nSave it, and you're good to go. Tested\n\nA: These launchers have one problem: you can't use them from the web browser, for example to attach archives to email messages or to upload files to sites like http://2shared.com/\nThere is an easy solution:\n\n\n*\n\n*Open a terminal window\n\n*Run ln -s /destination/directory ~/Desktop/nameofshortcut\nfor example: ln -s /data/music ~/Desktop/good_music\nThis way an icon appears at the desktop, with the image of a folder with an arrow below it, that represents a shortcut, instead of the spring or rocket of the launchers.\n\nA: In 14.04, you can right-click on the executable and choose Make Link, then you can drag and drop that link onto your desktop. \nTo attach this program to your launcher, simply start the program and then while it's running, right-click the icon on your launcher bar and choose Lock to Launcher.\nNote: adding programs to your launcher bar in this way does not work with WINE applications, however you can still add WINE apps to your desktop this way.\n\nA: For Ubuntu 19.10 and later :\nYou can add a desktop file into your <home_directory>/.local/share/applications folder.\nJust add a file like below -\n[Desktop Entry]\nType=Application\nTerminal=false\nIcon=/path/to/icon/icon.png\nName=Name of the application\nExec=/path/to/file/executable\n\n\nA: *\n\n*Start the terminal application. (Hotkey: Ctrl+Alt+T)\n\n*Use the command sudo nautilus to launch the file manager as super user (admin level of your account). (*)\n\n*Browse Computer > usr > share > applications and scroll down to the application you want to use.\n\n*Drag from the Nautilus file manager window to the desktop. (Make sure the nautilus window is not maximized.)\n\n*Close Nautilus and exit from the terminal.\n\n*Drag the new launcher around the desktop to the place you want it.\n\n\n(*) You will get an error if you just try to drag/drop with Nautilus as a normal level user. That error was what made me figure out the six steps listed here. It's another example of \"failure\" being a step on the path to success.\n", "Q: What is responsible for mounting disks listed in fstab? What script/init process/whatever is responsible for reading fstab and calling mount, during the boot process?\n\nA: It is the upstart job configured in \n/etc/init/mountall.conf \n\nthat in turn calls the ELF executable /sbin/mountall.\n\nA: It's the mountall executable which parses the fstab file and mounts (and checks if needed) all the partitions specified there.\n", "Q: How do I switch to Xubuntu? I'd like to use Xubuntu in 11.10 instead of Unity, how do I install it and switch to it?\n\nA: Instructions for 11.10 and 12.04\nInstall the xubuntu-desktop package - to do that, run the following:\nsudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install xubuntu-desktop\n\nAt some point during the install, you will be asked to choose between gdm and lightdm - I prefer lightdm, so thats what the screenshot shows.\nLogout, you will be confronted by the LightDM manager.\nThen, click the little cog wheel, and select Xubuntu Session.\nThen, enter your password, hit Enter and you'll be logged into Xubuntu.\n\n\nA: or use tasksel\nsudo apt-get install tasksel\nsudo tasksel\n\nCheck xubuntu and uncheck ubuntu.\n\nA: And to remove original gnome desktop (after jrg's how-to) remove the package ubuntu-desktop\nsudo apt-get remove ubuntu-desktop\n\nYou also sould do apt-get autoremove after doing that:\nsudo apt-get autoremove\n\n", "Q: Nautilus crashes when accessing some folders Since the past few days, Nautilus has started crashing whenever I access one of the Documents, video, pictures, download folder.

None of the Ubuntu One client stuff above helped for me, but removing nautilus-open-terminal definitely did. Nautilus now opens, and it seems to open slightly quicker.\nWith nautilus-open-terminal installed, if I launched nautilus from terminal, I would get a number of segmentation faults, and nautilus would either not open, or it would open then close after browsing a few folders.\nAfter reading a comment in that forum BruceBerry mentioned above, about removing nautilus-open-terminal, the terminal now can just open nautilus with absolutely no error messages and I have Ubuntu One file syncing just fine.\n\nA: what i did was;\nsudo apt-get purge nautilus-open-terminal\n\nand now everything is just fine!\nI love the new distro!\n\nA: Try to remove nautilus config files:\nrm -rf ~/.nautilus\n\nIf its not working open nautilus on console, re-do it and copy the log for me pls.\n\nA: I have this bug too.

I had to try it with wubi because this darn thing just won't boot off usb drives (even using the port on the right side). But this is another story.\nFirst thing I noticed was that the fan doesn't go into an idle state. It's always spinning on full power. The System Monitor shows an evenly distributed usage of all 4 virtual cores.\nBut what is actually looking very suspiciously to me is the output of lm-sensors:\nacpitz-virtual-0\nAdapter: Virtual device\ntemp1:        +62.0°C  (crit = +100.0°C)\ntemp2:        +29.8°C  (crit = +100.0°C)\n\nAs you can see, it seems like one core is not getting enough air. Or to name another possibility maybe one core isn't (fully) used by the system?\nOn Windows 7 I usually get around 55° C to 68° C (only when the CPU usage is near 100 %).\nDoes anyone have similar problems or maybe even a solution to get the temperatures leveled and therefore to get the fan go idle?\ncat /proc/cpuinfo \n\nA: I had the same confusion going on. The sensors command does not print the two core temperatures. The temperatures it showed are #1 the two cpu cores together and #2 the hdd. \nI stumbled upon the samsung-tools project.

Make sure the username and the computer name have no spaces and other non-alphanumeric characters in them, except the dash (-).\nAs for the partition, it looks like /dev/sda7 is the only candidate. Needless to say, a clean install will most likely overwrite everything on that partition, so backup if the files you need.\n\nA: If you wanted to dual boot, ubuntu asks in the installer if you want to install ubuntu besides window which is the first option and will divide the hard drive to semi half half.  If you went through the installer already its possible that you might have messed up windows and this option dual booting and letting the installer do it for you wont work.\nAlso if you do install ubuntu on the whole drive the volume labels and storage number will disappear. so windows vista or whatever version won't install because in the windows installer it will ask you that their is no partition available such as C: D: whatever: and storage is _: but you can make a partition in ubuntu and fix it with gparted for windows to be installed there. The only down side is that you have to reinstall ubuntu and now make sure you choose install besides windows. Just mentioning in case you wanted to have dual boot with vista just in case. Its doable.\n", "Q: Should I upgrade kernel packages on EC2 instances? On my EC2 server, when I do sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get upgrade, I see:\nThe following packages have been kept back:\n  linux-ec2 linux-image-ec2 linux-image-virtual linux-virtual\n\nShould I go ahead and do sudo apt-get install linux-ec2 linux-image-ec2 linux-image-virtual linux-virtual to force these packages to be upgraded?\n\nA: The short answer is, yes, you should keep your systems up to date with respect to security patches.\nHow exactly you roll out the security patches depends on your tolerance for risk.  Here are some options that I have used to answer this question in the past:\n\n\n*\n\n*Apply the upgrades to a set of QA systems that mimic your production environment and run all your regression tests to make sure that the changes don't break any functionality or cause performance issues.  Once you're satisfied, roll out the upgrades to your production systems.\n\n*Wait a day and see if there is a public outcry about problems caused by the updates.  If all seems peaceful, upgrade your production systems.\n\n*Apply every security patch on your production systems as soon as it's available.\nI have used a combination of all three of these approaches using Ubuntu, and have gradually moved towards option 3 over the years.  Security patches are heavily tested before released and great care is taken to not break existing functionality.  I've never had a problem upgrading within the Ubuntu supported images (though I did once have an issue years ago when I was using a non-Ubuntu kernel with Ubuntu on EC2).\nNote that upgrading the kernel also requires a reboot to apply the changes.\nThe above experience and recommendations apply only to upgrading within an Ubuntu release (e.g., 11.04).  Upgrading to a new Ubuntu release is a much larger and riskier task and definitely requires testing before you roll it out to your production systems.\nHere's an article on this topic that was just published by RightScale about how to manage security upgrades in their environment:\n\nhttp://blog.rightscale.com/2011/09/28/security-patching-in-the-rightscale-universe/\n\n", "Q: Is there an upper limit to Ubuntu One Storage Subscriptions?

The plot thickens ... while playing around with iptables and the like, I noticed that as soon as I blocked 1.2.3.4, the script was simply injected from another domain. I blocked that, it moved on to another.\nIn my web browser, I can access the script from ANY DOMAIN! What the heck is the ISP doing here?

I would like to set up glusterfs to replace my use of NFS4, how can I do that?\n\nA: (inprogress answer, any help testing this and editing would be appreciated, this works and has been tested on 12.04, but only by me!)\nThis is a step by step tutorial based on Michael J. Chudobiak's guide for Fedora. This assumes that you're trying to share the /fileserver directory from a central server to clients. I could never get this work in the past but gave it a shot in 12.04 and is now actually easier to me than using NFS.\nOn the server:\nInstall the server: sudo apt-get install glusterfs-server\nFirst create a volume you want to share, you can name it whatever you want, in this example I'm naming it volumename, and then you use your server's DNS name, I don't have DNS for my machines at home so I user servername.local to use the avahi-assigned DNS name:\nsudo gluster volume create volumename transport tcp yourservername:/fileserver\n\nNow we start the volume:\nsudo gluster volume start volumename\n\nAnd that's it! The server is now serving a gluster share called volumename.\nOn each client:\nInstall the client: sudo apt-get install glusterfs-client\nNow let's mount the shared glusterfs volume\n    mount -t glusterfs yourservername:/volumename /mountdirectory\n\nOn the client, see if you can access the files in /fileserver. If\nnot, read the /var/log/glusterfs/* files on both the client and the server.\nTo mount the share at boot, you can add this to your /etc/fstab\nyourservername:/volumename /mountdirectory glusterfs defaults,_netdev 0 0\n\nReferences:\n\n*\n\n*Mailing list post on migration to glusterfs\n\n*http://www.howtoforge.com/distributed-storage-across-four-storage-nodes-with-glusterfs-3.2.x-on-ubuntu-11.10 (This article is quite good)\n\n", "Q: How can I enable silent automatic updates for Google Chrome?

Surprisingly (as OpenJDK 7 was released to general availability about 4 months ago) Ubuntu 11.10 still uses OpenJDK 6 instead of 7 by default. How do I best fix this? I'd prefer to remove OpenJDK 6 completely and let OpenJDK 7 to be the default-jdk and default-jre.\nI don't want the official Oracle tarballs, I want deb repos - the standard Ubuntu way.\n\nA: OpenJDK 7 is in the normal ubuntu repos in 11.10, if you look for openjdk-7-jre and openjdk-7-jdk and install them using apt-get/synaptic/software centre they should replace openjdk-6, if it doesn't you could remove the openjdk-6-* packages first using apt-get purge openjdk-6-*\n\nA: The problem is that the default-jre package depends on OpenJDK 6 and most other packages have their dependencies defined as default-jre | openjdk-6-jre | sun-java6-jre - so until OpenJDK 7 becomes officially supported and will be used as the default version, or until all Java-dependent packages update their dependencies, you'll have to keep OpenJDK 6 around and set the OpenJDK 7 as default using update-java-alternatives. Example for 64-bit system:\n$ update-java-alternatives -l\njava-1.6.0-openjdk 1061 /usr/lib/jvm/java-1.6.0-openjdk\njava-1.7.0-openjdk-amd64 1051 /usr/lib/jvm/java-1.7.0-openjdk-amd64\n$ sudo update-java-alternatives -s java-1.7.0-openjdk-amd64\n\nOn 32-bit system the directory name will differ, you can find the right name using the -l switch. The second command may spit a lot of errors; either use --jre switch or just ignore errors – the script changes what it can and just ignores the rest.\nOne could theoretically edit the default-jre package to depend on OpenJDK 7, but be warned that this can cause more harm than good.\n\nA: The repo can be found here:\nhttps://launchpad.net/~openjdk/+archive/ppa\nor:\nsudo apt-add-repository ppa:openjdk/ppa\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get upgrade\n\nassuming you have OpenJDK installed\n\nA: For this, you must have both versions of jdk installed on your system. you can use apt-get to download both. \nAfter that try, \n$ sudo update-alternatives --config java\n\nand select the jdk you want to use.\nOpenjdk is sometimes unfavourable, for some of the applications.\nYou should also try for oracle-java or sun-java.\nThe link below is very useful for this purpose:\nhttp://www.webupd8.org/2012/01/install-oracle-java-jdk-7-in-ubuntu-via.html\n", "Q: Python/FFMPEG command line issues I have a problem with running an FFMPEG command from within a Python script.

I tried searching for the \"video4linux2 Cannot find a proper format for codec_id 0, pix_fmt -1\" error, but couldn't find anything consistent.\n\nA: Rather than splitting your \"command\" string you can call the subprocess module with parameter shell=True:\nsubprocess.Popen(command, shell=True)\n\nHowever we can't test here if this resolves your codec issue.\n\nA: This issue has been solved in stackoverflow.\nTo summarize the answer, it was a problem with the asker code, he was displaying the output on the screen at the same time that he was trying to record it and this caused a conflict.\n", "Q: How to efficiently send text entered on the command line to the system clipboard without using the mouse? Say I've typed the following long command into the command line\n $ some very long command that I want to copy to the clipboard\n\nHow can I get this onto the system clipboard efficiently?\nI'm using Gnome Terminal 2.23.1. \nI know that I can get the mouse and highlight it and copy it, but I want a general keyboard solution.\nIt would also be good if it generalised to multiple command-line programs.\nFor example, in bash in vi mode, I can press v and then edit the command in vim, and thus use Vim's copy to clipboard features, but this doesn't work when using R on the command-line. It's also a bit slow.\nI'd like it if in vi-mode, I could press yy and copy the contents of the line to the system clipboard, but this doesn't seem to work. Furthermore any yanking commands don't seem to copy contents to the system clipboard; they appear to only copy to a buffer used by bash.\nUPDATE:\nAfter posting I found \n\n\n*\n\n*this similar question on SO\n\n*this promising discussion of modifications to readline\n\nA: You could also use a clipboard manager like parcellite.

I am still searching for something better though as I would like to get it down to one command. However I get hung up because history doesn't function in shell scripts and I don't know that there is a way to use !! properly in an alias. Of course this doesn't appear to be quite what your asking for my intention is to use this for taking notes of what I am doing.

Then when I tried to install the packages back, they wanted to erase my version of gsl and install the pre-compiled one. \nIs there any way to make those packages use the source-compiled version of gsl?\n\nA: I think to get the best performance, you'll want to also rebuild the applications with icc, and I'm not entirely sure that using a library built with icc and an application built with gcc will actually work.\nBut to answer the question as asked, there are basically two ways:\n\n\n*\n\n*Rebuild a libgsl0ldbl package, using icc, with a different version suffix (or a different name but Provides: libgsl0ldbl), and install that, then install the packages which should no longer want the Ubuntu libgsl0.\n\n*Force installation of the application packages despite not having libgs0ldbl installed.

You log into a session running Unity or Gnome Shell from the display manager. In your example, it's not Unity that is interfering with Gnome Shell, but Gnome Shell that interferes with Unity. In other words; gnome-shell --replace doesn't properly shutdown Unity. \nIt would be very nice if Unity and Gnome Shell could cooperate on this so that you could just switch between them without logging out and back in, but this is in the future. \n\nA: This happened to me last night.  Had a quick look round today and it looks like this is a bug:\nhttps://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/fglrx-installer/+bug/855943\nThis suggests re-installing libgl1-mesa-glx is necessary after removing FGLRX.  The problem seems to be affecting Unity which, in turn is affecting Gnome Shell.  If this doesn't sort it there appear to be others reporting similar issues:\nhttp://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=1849217\nhttps://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/nautilus/+bug/826771\nHaven't been able to try any of these myself yet\n", "Q: How do I revert to 11.04's version of Nautilus? Since the developers deliberately broke the very useful emblems feature that I've relied on for years and years with Ubuntu ( How do I tag files with custom emblems in Nautilus? ), while offering no replacement whatsoever, I guess I need to revert to the older version of Nautilus. How can I do this?\n\nA: Nautilus in oneiric requires the GTK+3 libraries whereas Nautilus in Natty requires the GTK+2 libraries - quite different.\nI'm afraid this will not be easily possible - you will need to recompile and probably have to do major code surgery... it's far easier just to stay with 11.04 if this emblem function is a major capability you require until a Gnome 3 alternative is developed. \n\nworkaround\nPlease see this Q&A for a scripted workaround:\nIs there any tweak to bring back emblems in Nautilus?\n\nA: The new Nautilus is part of the gnome 3 software bundle, while the old nautilus was part of gnome 2. So I guess it is not the fault of the ubuntu developers. Some changes from gnome 2 to gnome 3 cannot easily be understood and complicate the workflow imho. Maybe there is an extension for nautilus somewhere to attach the icons.\nEDIT: Ok I found an explanation here on askubuntu: How do I tag files with custom emblems in Nautilus?\nThe Gnome developers simply removed this feature and here is an explanation by the gnome developer team. http://mail.gnome.org/archives/nautilus-list/2010-July/msg00023.html\nSorry that there is nothing more to do right now, but I guess someone will design a nautilus-extension for customizing icons with emblems.\n\nA: This feature is not useful to the majority of people, but it does add UI elements that clutters the experience. That's why it should be implemented as a plugin so that the relatively few people who wants it, can have it without bothering the majority. The freedom to tailor your software to suit your specific needs, is what makes open source a very friendly way of satisfying all needs. You really wouldn't want to have hundreds of dialogs installed by default in order to suit all potential use cases. \nAnd before you start complaining that nobody has written that plugin for you yet, please keep in mind that Ubuntu 11.10 has not been released. Ubuntu 10.04 is supported until April 2013. 11.04 is supported until October next year. There is plenty of time to fix this before you need to upgrade. \n", "Q: Linksys WMP54GS-EU wireless card not detected I have just installed Ubuntu 11.04 on my PC but Wireless Card Linksys WMP54GS-EU is not detected.\nIt says \"there is no firmware\".  \nOn System - Administration - Extra Drivers I found only the Video Card drive which I regularly downloaded.\nExternal software sources are duly enabled on Synaptic - Repository.\n\nOK I find the solution: I downloaded from Ubuntu Software Center the Repository \"b43-fwcutter\" detected from Terminal (lspci).\n\nA: (Since the OP has not logged in since Oct 21 '11 but reported an answer I post that as an answer to close this question.)\nBy issuing the following in a terminal you can detect what the device is called:\nlspci\n\nWhat you need to do is to install the utility for extracting the firmware for your wireless card.

I have checked the code for gnome-screensaver where this is implemented and as far as I can tell it is not configurable. I resorted to editing the source code not to do this and then rebuilding the package. If interested you can the the rebuilt package or a patch you can apply yourself.\nTo install the package once downloaded, in a shell (terminal window) do:\ndpkg -i gnome-screensaver_3.2.0-0ubuntu1local1_amd64.deb\n\nI am not proposing to send the patch upstream as this really is a hack because the rebuilt package is less than ideal for laptops where numlock makes some of the alphabetic keys generate numbers.\n", "Q: How to setup one ethernet interface as dhcp server and another interface as static ip?

Why?\nIs there any way to do this?\nMy script:\n#!/bin/bash\nchmod a+x ~/.bashrc\nsource ~/.bashrc\n\nAlso tried . (dot) instead of source. Same result.\n\nA: I want to complement ravi's answer:\nThis behavior is specific to Ubuntu (and probably most derived distros), since your default ~/.bashrc file starts with a short-circuit, Ubuntu 18.04, for example:\n# If not running interactively, don't do anything\ncase $- in\n    *i*) ;;\n      *) return;;\nesac\n\nThat will stop the evaluation of the file if it is running in a non-interactive shell, which is the case of your script since all scripts are run in a non-interactive shell, and subsequently every file you source will inherit this property.\neval hack\nI found out an ugly hack to workaround Ubuntu specifically, using eval instead of source:\neval \"$(cat ~/.bashrc | tail -n +10)\"\n\nIt simply skips the few first lines and evaluates the rest of the ~/.bashrc so the rest is evaluated and modifies the current execution.\nBe aware it is a magic number and might not work across Ubuntu versions; but may be a good solution if your are crafting scripts for more-or-less known systems.\nA fancier solution might involve using regex to target the specific bits that stop the evaluation.\nShebang alternative\nAnother alternative that might work better in some scenarios is forcing the script to run in an interactive shell by adding a flag in the shebang:\n#!/bin/bash -i\n\nBe aware of a few things:\n\n\n*\n\n*It is a better practice to use the #!/usr/bin/env bash form but this way you cannot start the shell with arguments.\n\n*Using the -i has it's own set of consequences, among them, programs will prompt for user interaction and this is usually not intended for scripts, for example, installing deb packages might stop the script at dpkg configure prompts.\n\n*I initially tried to use set -i and set +i to turn the feature on and off where I needed it, but this doesn't work.\n\n\nA: A shell script is run in its own shell instance. All the variable settings, function definitions and such only affect this instance (and maybe its children) but not the calling shell so they are gone after the script finished.\nBy contrast the source command doesn't start a new shell instance but uses the current shell so the changes remain.\nIf you want a shortcut to read your .bashrc use a shell function or an alias instead of a shell script, like\nalias brc='source ~/.bashrc'\n\n\nA: None of the other methods worked for me [source /path/to/file vs . ./path/to/file, alias, etc...], until, thanks to this tutorial I found that using the:\n#!/usr/bin/env bash shebang\ninstead of the simpler #!/usr/bin/env one lets arguments pass on to the interpreter, which I think is the key here – see this document for more info.\nIn any event, if source commands in any form aren't working for you, try checking your shebang, that might be the problem :)\n\nA: Your .bashrc usually starts:\n# If not running interactively, don't do anything\n[ -z \"$PS1\" ] && return\n\nSince your script does not have PS1 set (because it is not interactive), it doesn't reset path because it exits early . To demonstrate, modify your script:\n    #!/bin/bash\n    chmod a+x ~/.bashrc\n    PS1='$ '\n    source ~/.bashrc\n\nthis will now allow your scripts to work with the new .bashrc. \nNote: once your script exits , the env will be set to what it was before starting the script . The changes will be reflected the next time a terminal is started.\n\nA: Try:\nexec bash\n\nThis should reload ~/.bashrc, ~/.bash_aliases, etc.\n\nA: I just copied the contents of the original ~/.bashrc file, deleted it, created a new ~/.bashrc and pasted the contents. And, it worked.\n", "Q: Packaging best practices for third-party dependencies I'm packaging an application for the first time for Ubuntu. I have a few dependencies, the primary ones being Qt and ICU. I'm just not clear how to deploy these applications without getting into a kind of dll-hell for Linux.\nFor example, I would like to use version 4.7.4 of Qt because there are some bug fixes in that release that I would like to take advantage of. I would also like to deploy my application on all the currently supported versions of Ubuntu, which takes me back to Lucid. But the latest version available for Lucid is 4.6.2, which isn't even API-compatible with 4.7.4. The options, as I see it:\n\n\n*\n\n*Just say \"tough\" and only support Ubuntu versions that have the library I need, which would mean Oneiric at this point. For earlier versions, they are on their own to find a 4.7.4 library and resolve all its dependencies.\n\n*Provide private versions of the library, say libQtCore4_mycompany, and a package to install them.\n\n*Stick a private version of the assembly side-by-side with my application (perhaps /opt/company/package/lib) and set LD_LIBRARY_PATH before executing my application.\n\n\nNone of these are great options, and in particular, debuild is awful to use if you depart in the slightest bit from their expectations. I cannot link statically because of LGPL restrictions (at least, that's how I understand them.)\nI also have the reverse question. Suppose I decide to put a dependency on libQtCore4 (>= 4.7.4). I have seen enough regressions between Qt versions that there is a chance that 4.7.5, or 4.8.0, will break something in my application. Is that just something you have to deal with, or is it a best practice to depend on an exact version of the library, like libQtCore4 (= 4.7.4)?\n\nA: If you really want to support releases that don't have the required library version, then just use static linking.  Having a shared library that you are the only user of defeats the purpose of shared libraries, so you may as well just put it all in one binary.  You will even save some space since the parts of the library you don't call will be thrown out.\nI would suggest that you start with an oneiric build that just lists the depend normally, then switch to static linking when you backport it to older releases.\n", "Q: Update Manager saying check your internet connection...How do I fix this so it can update?

SSH:ing to the remote host through console doesn't prompt for a password, so the keyring does work for that specific key, just not together with autosshfs.\nAny ideas?\n\nA: Note that autosshfs uses keychain to set the environment variables s.t. ssh can find the ssh-agent and its authentication socket. If you haven't told keychain to manage the key you want to use for sshfs it will ask for your passphrase. Check the output of keychain -q --eval, which is what autosshfs will run.\nA few more debugging hints from issues I previously fell over:\n\n\n*\n\n*I'm assuming your .ssh/config specifies which key to use for the remote host?\n\n*Do you have keys in .ssh not added to the keychain ssh could possibly offer (and hence ask you to unlock)?\n\n*Did you use the same hostname when you tried logging in on the shell that you use with autosshfs (e.g. you use and alias for autosshfs and tried the full hostname in the shell)?\n\n*Have you verified that ssh-agent was still running and still had your keys loaded at the point autosshfs was failing / asking for the passphrase?\n\n", "Q: Dual monitors - Shifted pixels The resolution looks fine size-wise, but pixels are smudged.

Disks that have less access tend to break down less (this is not a universal rule but tends to be true);\nEXTRA safe setup:\nCreate a RAID1 setup where all you data will be stored equally on the 2 disks, if one fails the other will contain all you hard working projects and personal files;\nEasy split setup:\nUse one disk to install Windows and the other to install Ubuntu. Keeps your systems apart, gives you some security over the stability of your systems (if you break down Ubuntu or windows it wont interfere with the other and can be easy fixed by repairing the MBR) and when you get tired of using Windows and you finally decide to use only Ubuntu you can just erase it and use the 2nd disk for your backups and files ;)\nJust pick one and go with it, if you have 2nd thoughts later on (you probably will!) you can just choose another and test it up.

For that, I'd like to put them all in one archive. As this will be a backup, the format should suit that purpose. So, bottom line:\nWhich one is the most reliable/robust archiving format in Ubuntu? \n\nA: A tarball (.tar files) would be the way to go. Use the gzip compression format for less compression, but a good speed. bzip2 is much slower but provides a better compression ratio. For binary data, there is not a big different though.\nThe command for compressing a directory using the gzip compression:\ntar czf /path/to/save/backup.tar.gz directory-to-backup\n\nTo extract a gzip-compressed tarball while preserving file permissions:\ntar xzpf /path/to/save/backup.tar.gz\n\nReplace z by j for the bzip2 compression and add v before v (e.g. czvf and xzpvf) to print the filenames as they're archived / extracted.\n\nA: I choose 7zip (sudo apt-get install p7zip-full). It looks like an ideal compressing archiver from my point of view.\nI don't like classic tarballs for their clumsiness as the whole tar file is to be decompressed (which may happen behind the scenes, but still happen) just to view the archive's table of contents.\n\nA: Although not nearly as well known or widely used I'd be inclined to go with afio due to the way it compresses files individually thereby making recovery possible in case of corruption.  Install via aptitude or similar.\n\nA: It depends. The two most popular options are tarballs and zip files, but they both are lacking:\n\n\n*\n\n*.tar tape archives are a very popular option for most Linux users. It preserves UNIX file permissions (which is important for a backup) and hard links. It's supported out-of-the box on every Linux distro I've tested, as well as some Windows programs like 7-zip. However, tar has several limitations and drawbacks for the back-up use-case, as explained by the Duplicity developers. It can be very slow: even to get a list of filenames stored in the archive, the entire archive must be read. It also doesn't handle detailed meta-data that some newer filesystems have.\n\n*.zip zip files acts as both an archive and a compression format. For speed, you can disable compression completely. Zip files are better than tape archives in that they store a type of table of contents, allowing programs to quickly jump to the specific file they need to extract. It also stores checksums for the contents of each file, to allow for easy file corruption detection. Zip files are extremely popular, unfortunately, they are not suitable for Linux back-ups because they do not store simple file permissions.\n\n\nHere are two more options that are, sadly, also lacking:\n\n\n*\n\n*.7z 7z compressed archives have some excellent features such as encryption and support for very large files. Unfortunately, it does not store UNIX file permissions, so it is not suitable for Linux back-ups.\n\n*.ar classic UNIX archives are the predecessor to tar archives, and suffer from the same limitations as tar archives.\n\n\nIn my opinion, there is no completely robust back-up archive format for Linux back-ups, none that are sufficiently well-known to warrant my trust, any way.\nOne way to overcome the limitations of each of these formats is to combine them: for example, archive each file individually in a tar archive, and then archive all of these tarballs in one zip file.\nIf you want a really robust back-up, you should probably look into these solutions instead:\n\n\n*\n\n*back-up directly on to an external hard disk, with the same file system on both source and destination. This ensures that you will store each file's permissions and metadata exactly as intended. (As an aside, the owners and group owners of files are stored using their userid and groupid numbers, not their names.)\n\n*Use full-disk imaging and cloning software, like CloneZilla. You can't retrieve one file from one of these back-ups, but you can be absolutely sure that you have saved everything you possibly can.\nAnd remember, always remember: you can only be confident of your back-ups if you have attempted to restore them. If the worst came to worst and your source hard-drive was completely destroyed, could you restore everything you need to restore to a new hard-drive? Would it work as you expect? Try restoring your back-up to a new hard-disk and try running from that hard-disk for a couple of days. If you notice anything missing, you know your back-up wasn't thorough enough.\nAlso think about where you are keeping your back-ups. You need at least some back-ups that are not in same building as the source disks to protect yourself from theft or fire. Some options for this are the cloud, or a friend's house.\n\nA: Gzipped tarball (.tar.gz, .tgz), Linux archiving standard. You can't go wrong with that. \nNever in my life did I have a corrupted or even troublesome .tar.gz archive.

If you don't use \"force user\" and allow anonymous access then the share is probably accessed with the user nobody, which is not in \"storage_public\".\nYou probably want to change the permissions of your Public folder to \"drwxrwxr-x\", which would make it possible for Samba users to read from but not write to the Public folder.\nTo do this, use \"chmod o+rX Public\"\nWith regard to WINS: \nIt's not your network that has WINS support, but individual servers that can provide it. You can enable wins support in a particular server by setting \"wins support = yes\".\n", "Q: How to setup sudoers for Apache web service? # User privilege specification\nroot    ALL=(ALL:ALL) NOPASSWD: ALL\napache ALL=(ALL:ALL) NOPASSWD: ALL\nme ALL=(ALL:ALL) NOPASSWD: ALL\n\nIn Fedora both works:\nhttp://localhost/test\necho shell_exec(\"sudo dmidecode | grep UUID\"); // nothing shows to encrypt/decrypt licenses\n\nphp -r \"..license..\";\n\n\nA: In Ubuntu, apache runs as the www-data user.

The reason I ask the question is because I would like to emulate a device or create a device (specifically a usb-device) on disk without connecting the physical device.\nWhat I would like is to create a device such that it shows up in the lsusb output.\nWhat I have tried so far is creating a file with dd and using losetup to connect the created file with a loop device (/dev/loop*). That however doesn't create a message in dmesg.\nEdit:\nAs requested here's more info on my dilemma.\nI bought a USB-stick quite a while back with a language trainer that has limited it's execution (.exe)to the USB-stick. Since wine doesn't transfer the USB device data to the exe I was forced to use it in a VM. Since I use the stick on a VM, I thought I could emulate it on my host and go completely virtual - no need for the physical usb-stick.\n\nA: What you're looking for would be called a virtual USB device. I don't think the standard kernel contains anything like that.\nSome virtual machines can emulate USB devices for the guest (as opposed to relaying data to a hardware USB device connected to the host). For example, KVM can emulate USB storage and human interface devices.\nThe gadget framework is a way for Linux devices to function as USB peripherals (USB is highly asymmetrical: devices and hosts do different things). There is also a usbnet driver to relay USB connections over Ethernet; you could use this and write a program that talks the Ethernet protocol.\nUsing these indirect methods will not necessarily be easier than implementing your own USB driver. If you choose to go that route, Linux Device Drivers (3rd ed.) is the book to read.\nWhat you're asking is not likely to be easy. If you explain what your underlying problem is, someone may be able to suggest a better solution.\n", "Q: Is there any hope of Remnant's monthly release proposal going active? After reading Scott James Remnant's monthly release proposal for ubuntu (http://netsplit.com/2011/09/08/new-ubuntu-release-process/), I developed great hope that this might actually happen. I very much like the \"rolling release\" concept (a la Arch Linux) coupled with a stable \"for the masses\" LTS release every two years. Personally, I think the 6 month release cycle creates way too many bugs. Bugs that unfortunately live for years, even through LTS releases. Ultimately this situation is holding Ubuntu back from mainstream adoption. Pushing the LTS release as the \"recommended for consumers\" build would allow third-party application-developers to focus on a stable platform for increasing mainstream support and acceptance of Ubuntu. Having the OS overhauled every 6 months is too tumultuous for mainstream adoption. The rolling release would help increase the stability and development of the LTS while simultaneously providing cutting edge stuff along with less reliance on PPAs for those who want newer versions of applications. It would also more gradually ease users into change. \nI'm curious as to Canonical's reaction to the proposal. Is it receiving serious consideration? Does Canonical have another plan to address the many bugs that plague Ubuntu? \n\nA: It's not at all apparent that attempting to release significant updates every month will improve Ubuntu's quality, and there's fear it will make Ubuntu's quality assurance worse as Ubuntu has a limited number of developers and testers.\nMy opinion is that it's not Canonical's decision alone because Ubuntu is a product of Canonical paid developers and community developers (in addition to all the work done by the many upstreams including Debian, GNOME, and so on). This would at least partly lie in the Technical Board's responsibility. Besides Mark Shuttleworth, the Technical Board has 3 Canonical employees and 3 members from the community.\nIt's a decision that would need widespread developer support which so far I've not seen. It will definitely be discussed among participants at the next Ubuntu Developer Summit in a few weeks but don't count on it happening any time soon.\n", "Q: How can I make PDFs appear life-size when displayed at 100%? When I open a letter size PDF and then zoom to 100%, the page physically displayed on my monitor is smaller than a real letter size sheet of paper.\nHow can I make \"100%\" on the computer screen correspond with \"100%\" in real life?\nDetails\nThis message suggests that I should be investigating the system-wide DPI settings for my monitor. xdpyinfo reports: \ndimensions:    1024x768 pixels (271x203 millimeters)\nresolution:    96x96 dots per inch\n\nMy monitor has a native display resolution of 1024x768 pixels and a diagonal display size of 12.07 inches. PX CALC returns the following information:\nDPI: 106.05\nDot Pitch: 0.2395mm\nSize: 9.66\" × 7.24\" (24.53cm × 18.39cm)\n\nWhat I've tried so far\nRunning xrandr --dpi 106.05 successfully caused my PDF to appear actual size at 100%, but this effect was lost after rebooting.\nTo make the setting persistent I tried creating the following /etc/X11/xorg.conf:\nSection \"Monitor\"\n    Identifier   \"ThinkPad X60 LCD\"\n    DisplaySize  245 183\nEndSection\n\nSection \"Screen\"\n    Identifier \"Screen0\"\n    Monitor    \"ThinkPad X60 LCD\"\nEndSection\n\nAfter re-logging in, /var/log/Xorg.0.log contained\n[  1167.824] (**) intel(0): Display dimensions: (245, 183) mm\n[  1167.824] (**) intel(0): DPI set to (106, 106)\n\nbut xdpyinfo still reported\ndimensions:    1024x768 pixels (271x203 millimeters)\nresolution:    96x96 dots per inch\n\nand \"100%\" still appeared too small.\n\nA: xorg.conf doesn't even exist on new installs nowadays because of xrandr. Most drivers work fine with just xrandr and no xorg.conf (I think Nvidia is the exception). What you need is to have xrandr run at startup all the time. I documented on the Ubuntu Wiki how to make xrandr commands run as soon as the GUI starts.  Just use the same xrandr command you already figured out.\nFor Unity users reading along, equivalent directions for lightdm are here: https://askubuntu.com/a/69501/1158\n\nA: That's actually a very complicated question.\nI can't tell you how to solve your problem, but I can tell you why it occurs.\nMonitors have different pixel densities. A 1x1cm square on one monitor can contain a different amount of pixels that the same square on a different monitor.\nSee http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pixel_density for more information on that. \nBecause of this, 100% zoom will give you differently sized documents on different monitors.\nGiven this context, this question is probably better phrased as \"how can I change what 100% means in Evince?\"\nI don't know the answer to that. Sorry. I do hope my answer helps somewhat, though.\n\nA: You are obviously on the right track, since you found that changing the DPI settings worked when you ran the xrandr command.\nIt used to be easy to change the DPI setting in Gnome itself, but apparently, Gnome 3 made this difficult.\nYou can check out this answered question on AskUbuntu for info about how to go about it in Gnome 3:\nHow do I change the font DPI settings?\n\nA: There's a good answer on this blog about Display Size, DPI, and Text Size… an interesting DIY.

It would be nice to be able to access the content on windows/mac but i'm not sure if there's any reason i have to use ext4 to backup with ubuntu files.  This is really only for documents/photos/videos I have on the system.\n\nA: Generally this can be done but there are some disadvantages:\n\n\n*\n\n*there's a filesize limit (4GB)\n\n*you can't store any special file attributes like owner, permissions etc (this shouldn't be a problem for documents and videos though)\n\n*some sync tools like rsync don't work well when they can't check or set some of the files' attributes\n\n*old filesystems like FAT are more prone to fragmentation and file corruption\n\n\nAs an alternative you can install an ext3 driver on Mac/Windows or use NTFS (which doesn't suffer from problems number 1 and 4).\n\nA: If you want to access the backup drive with Windows too, go for FAT. I have tried using ext3/ext4 in Windows, with some drivers and with some other ext3/4 volume reading softwares in Windows but nothing really works. I got my ext3 volume corrupted once and after that I have decided not to try it again. \nAnd if you dont have any problems with the naming and sizelimit of FAT, there is really no reason for not using FAT on an external drive. If it was an internal drive, which would be accessed frequently, then ext file systems would be preferable because of journalling but for external drive FAT works well.\nAlso the file permissions and special attributes wont make any sense when accessed in Windows so no use keeping them. \n", "Q: Sandy Bridge support any good yet?

I'm particularly interested in VDPAU support in mplayer, and would like OpenGL to work well enough to run GoogleEarth.\nYes, I have read the thread from June.  Support at that time was NOT what I'd call acceptable, so I'm wondering how much it has improved.\n\nA: As far as I know, a lot of people have no, or very few issues with Sandy Bridge now. The issues people have tend to be related to the classics:\n\n\n*\n\n*Various networking driver issues\n\n*Complicated graphics setups (Optimus, et al)\n\n\n.. And not basic architecture issues. Judging by the news I read on Phoronix the performance of SB seems to keep improving too as new kernels keep coming out.\nI'd say it's a safe upgrade as long as you check the components outside of the standard stack (graphics, networking) to make sure they're safe.\nAnd VDPAU is Nvidia only. If you know that and you're adding a Nvidia graphics card, you'll need to check to make sure it's supported.\n", "Q: How to install adobe flash into bootable USB Let me explain a couple things before my question...I am running Ubuntu from my flash drive because my hard drive crashed and I am waiting on some parts to come in. Since i cannot install Ubuntu onto the hard drive it makes it a real pain to install adobe flash. What I am wondering is it possible to take the flash.so file and put it into the files that the USB drive uses to run Ubuntu, so in other words I install flash and it works when the computer boots up and I launch firefox.\n\nA: My understanding is that when creating a USB drive with Ubuntu's Live USB Creator application, it is possible to reserve some space to store data and packages installed \"on top\" of the ISO image. I.e. chances are all you need to do is actually install flash while booted from your USB drive.\nSee Ubuntu wiki for details.\nIn case your USB drive was created without this option (i.e. something like \"discard changes on shutdown\" has been chosen) - I'm afraid the easiest would be to re-create the drive, because it's basically an ISO filesystem (i.e. a CD image) and it's not supposed to be written to once created.\n", "Q: Can't log into Skype: complains of the existence of another instance when there isn't one Whenever I try to log into Skype in Ubuntu 11.10 64-bit, it always says \"Sign in failed\" and \"Another Skype instance may exist\", thus preventing me from being able to log in.\nI've had this kind of error in the past on previous Ubuntu releases where I would forget I already had Skype running and try opening it in the Dash again, and it was easily solved by just closing the extra window. But this time is different, and much more frustrating, because I get this error even after starting from a cold boot or running killall skype...times when AFAIK Skype should not even be running at all.

This usually fixes any problems of this kind.\nAccording to sixones:\n\nRather than wiping the entire folder, you can close Skype and delete these files; ~/.Skype/shared.lck, ~/.Skype/username/*.lock, ~/.Skype/username/*-journal. Deleting them all clears out the lock and keeps your chat history and preferences.\n\nYou can do this by running the following command in a terminal:\nrm ~/.Skype/your-username-here/shared.lck, ~/.Skype/your-username-here/.lock, ~/.Skype/your-username-here/*-journal\nWhere \"your-username-here\" is your Skype username.\nYou can also use the file manager to do this. Simply navigate to your ~/.Skype/your-username-here folder and delete the files manually.\n\nA: You can see if another skype instance is running if you type ps -ax. If you see a skype instance in the list, you could try to kill it with kill -kill XYZ. XYZ would be the pid - a most number with 4-5 digits.

How can I stop workspaces from switching automatically to other workspaces when selecting different applications?\nI personally find it extremely annoying, and bad UI, to have the context/rug/workspace be pulled from underneath me and I want to prevent, under any circumstance, except of my own choosing the automatic workspace re-adjustment program that Unity (and OSX, but that's another story) imposes on me. Is there a way to do this?\nThanks!\nUPDATE\nThe interface solution that I'm looking for exists already in Gnome \"Classic\", unfortunately it is not as nice of a desktop as Unity or Gnome3, it has a simple bar at the top and an open windows bar at the bottom of the screen, and on this bottom bar there are 4 work-spaces screens on the right side, it is these that work exactly how I imagined a good work-space should work -- that is: in each work-space I can start up an application and if I switch to another one work-space I can start up the same application without being switched to my previous works-pace.\nI imagine if this behavior exists already that someone with deep knowledge about the work-space or perhaps a developer that has worked on these or their updated counterpart in Unity could let me know how the appropriate settings can be manipulated in Unity to bring back the behaviour of the work-spaces similarly to gnome 'classic'.\n\nA: Actually the easy answer would be to middle click on the app icon in the Unity launcher to launch another instance of the application if it's already opened in whatever virtual desktop you find yourself in. \n\nA: I think you may look into running multiple X sessions instead of using workspaces - this way they'll be totally isolated from each other, I think you even may be able to run different window managers in them.\nYou can start an additional X server using something like\nstartx -- :1\n\nwhich you then will be able to access by pressing Alt-Ctrl-F8..12\nI tested it and was able to run a KDE session at Alt-Ctrl-F7 and a Gnome session at Alt-Ctrl-F8, so, as you can see, the isolation is perfect. Though it maybe a bit of an overkill for the problem you have...\nHere's an article showing how to run two sessions with different window managers (tough, of course, you can use Unity on both).\nNote that you need to edit your /etc/X11/Xwrapper.config and set allowed_users=anybody to be able to run as a non-root user. \nThere also some restrictions in terms of running two instances of a same program as a same user in two different X sessions, because they may step on each other feet and overwrite each other's settings - so to be able to run, say, Firefox, you may need to create two separate profiles.\n\nA: On Ubuntu 22.04 and later the setting is:\nSettings -> Multitasking -> Include applications from the current workspace only as marked by the mouse cursor in the below screenshot.\n\n", "Q: Wired Connection shared with other computers connects then disconnects in the nm-applet connecting with shared with other computers connection in NetworkManager.

I'll rephrase it my own words: Is it possible to run Ubuntu's installer, which is present at Ubuntu's LiveCD, from a regular Ubuntu system (installed to HDD)?\nThe GUI installer you found on the LiveCD is packaged as ubiquity. It's not clear, what will happen if you try to install and run this from your your HD install. While it might work, this does not seem supported or tested.\nIt's well known, that Debian-based systems such as Ubuntu can be installed in a chroot environment. Chroot is a tool, which can treat any directory as the root directory \"/\". You can easily create a chroot environment on your external HDD. If you want to boot this chroot Ubuntu, you have to install a kernel and a boot loader. While this is a known and tested method for Debian (and I have personally done this with Ubuntu), the tutorials on the web are outdated. Hence, this is only an option if you are familiar with grub and the Linux boot process.\nActual Answer: While your question is reasonable, it does not seem supported by Ubuntu or any other modern operating system. We have become so used to install OSs from a boot CD or USB, that other methods were neglected.\nYou didn't specify what the purpose of installing Ubuntu onto the external HDD is. If you leave this external HDD connected as it is, your computer will probably never boot it, because it prefers your internal HDD. If you change the BIOS settings, connect the external HDD to a different computer, or anything the like, then this (currently) external HDD can become the role of the boot HDD. Now, here comes the catch: It takes some guesswork to know now, whether and how this HDD will ever become bootable. The PC BIOS is a horrible bootloader, not designed for such things. That's probably why your idea is not supported through easy installation vectors such as Ubuntu's GUI installer.\n\nA: I think this link that may help: How do I install Ubuntu to a USB key? (without using Startup Disk Creator)\nIn short:\n\n\n*\n\n*Install qemu-kvm package and dependencies if not yet done so.\nsudo apt-get install qemu-kvm\n\n\n*Run virtual machine with external HDD (assume it is mounted at /dev/sdb) as internal drive and Ubuntu ISO file as cdrom. Add more ram to virtual machine with -m 2GB if you have plenty of ram on your machine to speed up installation process.\nsudo kvm /dev/sdb -cdrom ~/.cache/testdrive/iso/ubuntu_natty-desktop-i386.iso\n\nPersonally, I prefer to run any installer on target PC/laptop instead of remove HDD from it and install at another PC/laptop.\n\nA: It isn't really necessary to reinstall at all. You can just copy your installed operating system onto the other disk and boot it. If the two disks are of equal size, then it's very easy: \nsudo dd if=/dev/disk1 of=/dev/disk2\nThis will make disk2 a clone of disk1, meaning that the partitions and everything will be copied. When the copy is finished, you can boot from the external disk, and have everything you had. \nIf your computer supports hardware virtualization, then you can also install kvm -- probably with virt-manager as a GUI -- and use the external disk as a disk for a virtual machine. \n\nA: This may be possible by using Virtual Box. You would just need to set up a USB device in Virtual Box, and then install to the external drive that way.\n", "Q: How to disable Avahi? I am completely new Linux systems especially Ubuntu.

If you do ifconfig -a you will probably see that your eth0 IP address is within the 10.0.0.0 range, so this is you local network route.\n\n\nThird entry tells you the following:\n\n\n*\n\n*If any traffic does not fit the traffic defined on any other rules then use this route. Imagine you want to visit www.yahoo.com.  The address will be translated (I don't know what the exact result, but it won't be in the 10.0.0.0 range for sure).  Since it won't fit on the 1st or the 2nd route, it will be routed using the RTA1025W.home gateway.

To my understanding its when a datagrams's header specifies a hostname, am I right?\n2)Why does it refer to hosts before resolv.conf? \n3)After the hostname is resolved, the system turns to the routing table?\n\nA: 1) Normally your system would use the DNS server on your 'resolv.conf'. If you visit www.yahoo.com your system will contact the DNS, the DNS returns the IP address of that address and your systems then knows what IP address corresponds the address www.yahoo.com.\n2) It uses hosts before trying to resolve an address because hosts file is used to override any address you are trying to resolve. ie: you already have probably an entry there, 127.0.0.1 localhost tells the system that if you are trying to contact the host with the name \"localhost\" it will do so by using the address 127.0.0.1, in this case its your lopback interface on your eth0.\n3) After the system knows an address of a host either looking directly on your hosts or by contacting the DNS servers in 'resolv.conf' it will look at the routing table to see which of the rules explains what to do with the traffic with destination to the IP address obtained.\nIe: Imagine you have 2 computers on your network with hostnames of \"Ubuntu-One\" and \"Ubuntu-Two\", each computer will probably have this assigned at the host file:\n127.0.0.1 localhost Ubuntu-One for computer Ubuntu-One\n127.0.0.1 localhost Ubuntu-Two for computer Ubuntu-Two\nThis is done automatic and its the reason you can resolve 'localhost' and 'Ubuntu-One\" and \"Ubuntu-Two\" on each respective terminals.\nTry to ping Ubuntu-Two from Ubuntu-One and Ubuntu-One will contact the DNS servers at your resolv.conf file, the servers will say \"I dont know any IP related to that address\" and you PC will reply \"Unknown hostname\". Add the line <IPADDRESSFROMUBUNTU-TWO Ubuntu-Two to the hosts file of Ubuntu-One and one you try to ping again the system will see that on the hosts file the IP address from Ubuntu-Two is x.x.x.x, will then check your routing table to see which rule applies to that IP or IP range and will contact the host using the specified gateway (or none). Thats is why hosts is ever before resolv.conf.\n\nA: It needs to at least resolve the hostname to an IP whenever you want to connect to anything. It uses settings from /etc/hosts first because it's local to your system. If you haven't provided it, then it will look it up from your DNS servers, which are defined in resolv.conf. \n", "Q: Scheduling a reboot on a remotely located Ubuntu server I work on a ubuntu server located in a place where I don't usually go. I use ssh over openvpn to access it. The machine has multiple wired interfaces, many static routes and multiple default gateways to WAN. I frequently change interface adresses and routes. Most of the times the changes I do are temporarily--a reboot would reset the experiments I have done. In some cases some of those modifications have gone wrong, and the machine has gone offline. In such cases I had to call up someone at the place where the server is located to send the machine into a reboot.\nNow I would like to schedule a reboot--lets say after 2 hours the machine should go into a reboot cycle. And in those two hours I can do whatever temporary experiments that I want. If all the temporary changes succeed then I should be able to prevent the \"afer 2 hour\" reboot from happening. So what I want is:\n\n\n*\n\n*How to tell the server to reboot after a certian time?\n\n*If I decide that the machine should not go into a reboot, I should be able to cancel it.\n\n\nA: You can also use at to schedule reboots. For example sudo at 22:00 to run the command at 22:00 as root. Then enter the command you want to run: /sbin/shutdown -r now and end with ctrl-d. If you decide not to run this command, run sudo atrm 1 to delete the first one in  the at queue. With sudo atq you can see the queue.\n\nA: On the terminal type shutdown -r 10 Waiting 10 minutes before the restart& that will make the server reboot in 10 mins, broadcast a message explaining that and pressing control+c will interrupt the reboot request.\nOn the terminal type shutdown -r 18:00 Rebooting at 18:00 hours& that will make the server reboot at 18:00 hours, will broadcast a message explaining that and can be interrupted with control+c.\nYou can also interrupt any shutdown / reboot request on your \"working\" terminal with shutdown -a.\n", "Q: How to find unused IP Address on a network?

What configurations does it save me from doing?\n2)I read here the following paragraph:\nThe Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP) is a network service that\nenables host computers to be automatically assigned settings from a server\nopposed to manually configuring each network host\n\nWho provides that service? Is it my ISP, a local program or a local hardware (like my router)?\nAlso, what configuration files will be edited as a result of using DHCP?\nThanks!\n\nA: \nWhy use DHCP?\n\nIt's the standard way of running a network. Any computer that you bring into your network will run as soon as it connects to it (either wire or wireless). Your computer will also automatically connect to most networks.\nYou should use DHCP as the default way to configure a network, unless you have some specific needs. Even in a medium or big size network, most of the machines are given their settings by DHCP, usually only a handful of machines have static IPs: servers, routers, printers (in my office), etc...\n\nWho provides that service? Is it my ISP, a local program or a local hardware (like my router)?\n\nIn a normal small office or home network it is the router who takes care of DHCP.\n\nAlso, what configuration files will be edited as a result of using\n  DHCP?\n\nAs it is the default configuration of Ubuntu, usually you don't need to do any configuration or change anything.\nAFAIK, the only file that is changed automatically while you are using DHCP is /etc/resolv.conf (it list yours dns servers), all the rest of the configuration is keep in memory.\nThe wikippedia entry has lots of extra info.\n", "Q: Modifying the behavior of Tab (possibly) using Compiz I have set up Compiz and my desktop in a way that I really like that maximizes my screen real estate on my 10' netbook, but there is a small annoyance that I would like to know if I could change.\nThe set up\nUbuntu 11.04 using Ubuntu Classic with Compiz on an Asus eee 1015PEM.

I have a large music library that is currently managed by iTunes in Windows. When I started out 5 or 6 years ago ripping my music to my PCs I had a fairly basic understanding of audio formats, and I somewhat arbitrarily chose to rip all my CDs into the WAV format. So now I have over 1 TB of music ripped in iTunes, and none of my files have metadata attached. (iTunes software stores the artist/song/etc. info in an XML file, so I have a reference, and the library is fine, works great in iTunes/Windows).\nI've been using Ubuntu exclusively for almost a year now, and I want to convert my music library, which is currently spread out over 3 hard drives, to FLAC files w/ metadata, and move away from iTunes.\nWhat's the most reliable/efficient way to convert all my WAV files across the hard drives to FLAC from the command line while retaining/adding metadata to the new FLAC files? There are just too many files to go through one album at a time. Is there any audio fingerprinting software out there that could find the metadata after the WAV > FLAC conversion? Should I try and reference the iTunes XML file or is that not necessary?\n\nA: To simply convert files from Windows WAV to FLAC on the commandline the official tool flac  would be the obvious choice.\nflac ~/Music/*.wav\n\nwould convert all WAV files from the Music directory in your HOME to flac. By using the option:\nflac --keep-foreign-metadata ~/Music/*.wav\n\neven non-flac metadata will be preserved in your resulting *.flac file. However if - as you say - your files are not tagged there is not an easy way to achieve correct metatags. Some tools like metaflac from the flac package can import metatags from file but these files need to meet specific criteria for appropriate tag recognition involving conversion of your XML file.\nTherefore I would rather recommend one of the graphical solutions like Ex Falso  or \nMusicbrainz Picard  that offer the creation of metatags from filenames (in case they are appropriate). \nPicard also has a tool to auto-recognize a not tagged song to look it up in the Musicbrainz library and create appropriate metatags.\nBefore playing around with tags it is strongly recommended to backup your original files in case something goes wrong. I speak of own experience when tagging of multiple files resulted in entirely wrong and bad tags that led to almost unretrievable originals as these files were listed with a (random) wrong name in my library.\n\nA: Have not tried this myself as my music collection was built in Ubuntu, there is a good guide in link below that covers the cmd line conversion and editing appending of tags\nhttp://www.tuxarena.com/static/cli_audio_guide.php\n", "Q: Installation from a Live USB changes the network device name (eth0, eth1, ...)

The removal of libc-bin is incorrect; you definitely don't want to remove it.\napt wants to update packages as a part of the install.  Your system is not up-to-date, and this might be confusing apt slightly.

An elderly computer of ours has stopped working. When it's turned on, it gives an error of \"unsupported display\" - this is normal for us and happens because the graphics card can't render the splash screen. However, now it just stays stuck at that error message and won't boot. \nI booted a live CD and looked over a bunch of log files but none of them have entries from today, the day the problem started.\nIs there any way to figure out what the error on the hidden splash screen is?\n\nA: The easiest way might be to boot the system that's having problems and disable the splash screen. That will then show the boot messages during bootup.\nTo show the boot messages, start up and when grub appears press 'e' to edit the grub entry. Press the down arrow until you get to the linux kernel line. Press CTRL-E to go to the end of the line. Remove quiet splash from the line. You might also need to delete any line that begins with gfxmode if it still doesn't work. I had to remove the gfxmode line to be able to see the boot messages on Xubuntu. Now press F10 to boot. The boot messages should appear.\nSomething else you can try is to boot from your rescue disk, mount the filesystems of the computer, then look at /var/log/syslog, /var/log/boot.log, and /var/log/boot. The last one may not exist or be empty if the computer is not configured to run bootlogd at startup. You can edit /etc/default/bootlogd and make sure that BOOTLOGD_ENABLE=Yes is set, then reboot, to get the boot output into /var/log/boot.\nBetween all of those options you should be able to determine where the system is getting stuck at bootup.\n", "Q: how to access and change tcp configuration I wanna play the buffer size and other settings in the tcp configuration in order to finish the project that am working on and analyzed the results ??\nI want to know if there is a file or something else that I can access to see and edit these settings and since am new to ubuntu I have no clue where to start so if you could please be informative in the answers I will appreciate that.\nI have one more question is it different in fedora or is it the same as ubuntu ? because I have to do it on both OS \nthanks for helping \n\nA: It's the same. You can read/set most TCP/IP parameters with the ifconfig command. You can find out about which parameters by reading man ifconfig. You have to use sudo (or some other way of becoming root) to set. Also, I've found that the changed parameters take effect ONLY as the interface transitions from DOWN to UP (via ifconfig). There's also the iwconfig command for wireless parameters man iwconfig\nGood luck with your assignment.\n", "Q: Easily make website without coding \nPossible Duplicate:\nBasic Web Development IDE/Editor like Dreamweaver? \n\nI know Windows has some create programs to make websites attractive websites without coding.  Can anyone recommend to me some programs that run on Linux where I can create my own websites with a  fair amount of flexibility in design?\n\nA: Well, firstly I would whole-heartedly recommend you to either learn HTML/CSS/JavaScript or install one of the million of Content Management Systems (CMS) available, most of which would allow you to install themes or somehow else customize their look. You would even be able to build a custom theme though it would most likely require learning something about the above mentioned technologies.\nBuilding websites in FrontPage-like programs is sooo like year 1998 :)\nSecondly, there are some WYSIWYG HTML editors available, for example \n\n\n*\n\n*Blue Griffon (seems to be the most actively maintained)\n\n*Kompozer\n\n\n\n*\n\n*Quanta Plus (haven't been ported to KDE4, site is down)\n\n*Amaya\n\n\nA: It's not a program, per se, but if you have a Google account you could always use Google Sites to easily create a website in your browser and for free, with pretty much no coding necessary (though you can still tweak some of the HTML yourself later if you feel like it). Probably the best part of this is that since your site will be hosted by Google and the tools run in your browser, you can use it to work on your site(s) on any computer with Internet access. In fact, this is what I'm using right now for a hobby project of mine.\n\nA: Please check out Bluegriffon.  It has good support for HTML5 and CSS3. About Bluegriffon, from its website:\n\nBlueGriffon is a new WYSIWYG content editor for the World Wide Web.\n  Powered by Gecko, the rendering engine of Firefox, it's a modern and\n  robust solution to edit Web pages in conformance to the latest Web\n  Standards.\n\nI have detailed its installation at: https://askubuntu.com/a/204698/11932\nThis is what it looks like:\n\n", "Q: Macbook Pro 8.1 and Ubuntu conflict I recently installed Ubuntu 10.04 Lucid onto my Macbook Pro 8.1 over my Mac OS, and I am having many issues. The wireless is not working, the software update window will respond just long enough to get my hopes up, right click will not work, the mac hotkeys refuse to work, and the ubuntu software center spouts that all of the provided packages are \"unverified\", and outright refuses to let me install anything, even a software bit that worked on my last macbook/ubuntu install. HELP!?!?!?!\n\nA: From the Ubuntu Forums: \nsnippit\nApple Intel Mac (Mactel) FAQ\nWelcome to the Apple Users Forum at ubuntuforums.org.\nThis forum is focused on providing community support on the installation and setup of Ubuntu running on Apple hardware.\nThis FAQ is targeted at Users with a Intel-based Macintosh computers (mactel) with Core and Core 2 CPUs or Xeon. If you have a PowerPC-based Mac (G3, G4, G5) Please see the PowerPC FAQ. Please be sure to always check this FAQ and the Mactel-Support Community Support Documentation before asking a question in the forum, and when asking a question in the forum, post your Mac's version string.\n\n\n*\n\n*Can I run Ubuntu on my Mac?\nYES! You will have to reduce the size of your OSX partition in order to make room for Ubuntu.\nRead more from the link above. It is very detailed and descriptive.\nUbuntu Documentation MacBook Pro 8.1 \n\nA: Check here for specifics to that model - Mac Book Pro 8,1 Natty\nI just installed 10.04 on my MB Pro model 5,1 and used the wiki for my model to get everything installed and running correctly. \n", "Q: How to upgrade effortlessly from Ubuntu 10.04 to Ubuntu 11.10 on the same machine Ubuntu 11.10 is now a few days away. I have quite a lot of apps installed on Ubuntu 10.04. How can I effortlessly upgrade from Ubuntu 10.04 to Ubuntu 11.10. Please suggest the minimal disruption route. In case I have to reinstall all the apps how can I take a backup of all the apps that I have..\n\nA: There are two supported upgrade paths for Ubuntu; LTS-to-LTS and stepwise. That means that you should be able to easily upgrade from 10.04 to 12.04, but from 10.04 to 11.10 would require some steps: \n\n\n*\n\n*upgrade from 10.04 to 10.10\n\n*Upgrade from 10.10 to 11.04\n\n*upgrade from 11.04 to 11.10\n\n\nThis would take quite some time, and because of unusually large changes in 11.04 and 11.10, I don't think I would recommend you even attempt it. If you are using a normal desktop without webserver or SQL, etc, then all your apps are configured in your home directory. This means that if you install a new Ubuntu and install your apps anew, then they would automatically use your current configurations and data. If you do have MySQL or similar installed, then it becomes more complicated as they often store their data in /var or other places. \nUbuntu 10.04 is supported until April 2013, so you shouldn't feel rushed to upgrade. In April you'll be able to upgrade directly from the update manager. If you do want to, then it might still be possible to use the new graphical installer to replace your current version, but I haven't tried that myself. You would then have to install your applications afterwards, but they would be automatically configured. \nYou do need to take precautions and please don't do this without having a backup. \n\nA: One  option would be to upgrade through all the intermediate releases - i.e. 10.04 - 10.10 - 11.04 - 11.10. I have a few machines which have been continuously upgraded from 7.10 or maybe earlier to the current version and they're still running fine. \nAnother option would be to dump the list of your installed applications using\ndpkg --get-selections > installed_applications.txt\n\nThen you can make a clean install (this will be easier if you have /home on a separate partition, but supposedly Ubuntu installer is able to keep /home even it's on the same partition), and then re-install the applications using\ndpkg --set-selections < installed_applications.txt\ndselect update\napt-get dselect-upgrade show\n\nBecause the applications keep their configuration in your home folder, all application settings should be preserved.\nMake sure you have a backup before attempting anything :)\n", "Q: How to restore the default Lubuntu panel in LXDE based Lubuntu releases?

I don't know which one to do for Ubuntu since I'm from a Windows background where I will just run the .exe file and the job is done.\nAnd note that from command prompt I have tried to install it, it shows only the previous version of Groovy 1.7. But I need to install Groovy 1.8. Since I'm a novice in Ubuntu, it will be good if the answer is in simple steps.\nThanks in advance.\n\nA: I would say downloading the Debian installer, then clicking on the file and providing your password to confirm your permission to install software would do the trick.\n.deb files roughly equivalent to .msi files in Windows :) They often also include pre- and post-install scripts to configure the system, so I would expect everything to be in a useable state once you install it. \nExample: installing Apache configures it with some basic defaults and even starts the server so you can access http://localhost/ and see \"It works!\" page straight away. \n", "Q: Create a service in linux using shell script I want to create a service in linux as we do in windows. which i can start or stop with help of a script. the service has to launch a gaming application which has some dependencies associated with it.\nBasically i want a script executing which creates a service in linux, this service will basically launch a gaming application(launching is also done through a script) , so its like the service has to launch a script.\nPurpose of the service: i will like the service to auto restart the application in case it crashes. Got to know that auto restart of application can be done through services\nplease help me on this i am new to linux :(\n\nA: I have a feeling that you only mention \"service\" because on Windows it's possible to configure a service to auto-restart when it crashes. I even think it wouldn't be easy to make an arbitrary \"game application\" to work as a service on Windows because services run with limited privileges.\nIf you need a script which auto-restarts an application if the latter exits with a non-zero error code (i.e. when it crashes), check Anycorn's answer to a similar question on stackoverflow. It's very simple and it does not involve any services.\nIf you want step-by-step instructions, here what I would do:\ncreate a directory called bin in your home folder:\nmkdir ~/bin\n\ncreate a script \"startgame\" in that directory:\ntouch ~/bin/startgame\n\nopen it in a text editor:\ngedit ~/bin/startgame\n\nenter the following text:\n#!/bin/bash\nwhile [ 1 ]; do /path/to/game/executable && break; done\n\nsave the file;\nset executable bit on it:\nchmod +x ~/bin/startgame\n\nexecute the script by typing in the terminal\nstartgame\n\nAll of the above can be achieved without terminal - i.e. create a folder using Nautilus, create a file, make it executable; create a desktop shortcut etc.\nIf you're interested how the script works:\nwhile [ 1 ]; do ... done\n\nis an infinite loop \n/path/to/game/executable\n\nstarts the application and waits for it to finish (obvously, you need to change it to the actual path of your application)\ncommand1 && command2\n\nexecutes command1 and then executes command2 only if command1 terminated with a zero return code (which indicates success). I.e. the loop will only stop ('break' statement) if the program terminated without an error, otherwise it'll be restarted.\n", "Q: How to run rc.local as normal user? I have some commends that I wish to be called right after login, including 'startx', and I thought rc.local seems a nice place for them, but the problem is that rc.local is run as root and I don't want that, obviously I can do something like this:\nsu username -c somecommend-here\n\nBut I am looking for a way to run the whole 'rc.local' as normal user, or perhaps there is a better place to put my code ?\nPS. I am using Ubuntu-mini-remix 1104i386\nThanks\n\nA: The easiest way to launch a command when a user logs in is to create a .desktop file for the command and stick it in the ~/.config/autostart folder. What does the desktop file look like? Here is an example that retrieves the Ask Ubuntu home page with wget every time the user logs in:\n[Desktop Entry] \nName=Launch wget\nComment=Fetches the Ask Ubuntu home page.\nExec=wget http://askubuntu.com/\n\n\nA: I don't know the differences between /etc/rc.local and a crontab, but I generally make a service account and add the appropriate job. For example: sudo crontab -u p4padmin -e\n@reboot ~/bin/p4p -d -r ~/var/p4p/cache/foo -p 2020 -t depot:2020 -L ~/var/p4p/log/foo.log\n\nYou don't have to login for the service to execute.\n\nA: The linux way is to append your commands to ~/.bashrc instead of /etc/rc.local.\nEvery user has a .bashrc in it's home directory.\nThis scriptfile is run automatically just after a user logs in.\nIt is run with the credentials of the user so a su command is not needed.\nIt seems to me that this is exactly what you are looking for.\n", "Q: Set terminal size permanently I click in terminal: terminal->132x43 to change terminal size but after each reboot terminal size is set to default setting and I have to change it again.

And frankly, I'm pretty pissed because of this, especially since none of the available clients even supports open source Exchange alternatives properly (with MAPI support).\nYes, you have alternatives. You could use Thunderbird for email, Sunbird for calendaring and then some other solution for shared contacts etc, but that probably won't help you connecting to Exchange.\nOutlook WebAccess won't help you much either, since Exchange 2007 will severely reduce the functionality if you're not using Internet Explorer.\nIf you have any influence on the back end (server side), I highly recommend evaluating alternatives like SOGO, Zimbra or Zarafa. The latter provides a WebAccess very similar to that of Exchange, but it also works perfectly on Firefox. I use it on a daily basis for all my work.\nOf course if you don't have any influence on the server side, you're pretty much screwed. The only alternative I can think of in that case is running Outlook on a virtual machine or by using Wine. But I'm not sure if there are any Outlook versions that will work reliably on Wine...\nIf you want to know more on Exchange alternatives I can help you, but I must warn you that I have the most experience with just one of the alternatives ;-)\n", "Q: Can Ubuntu One sync files \"in place\" instead of filling up /tmp? I enabled Ubuntu One in 11.04 and marked my Documents folder for sync. Now, it's very slugish (which was mentioned here already), managed to upload only 160 MB in 5 days (it's a disaster IMO). Anyway, apart from being so slow, U1 fills my /tmp with the files to be synced (/tmp/tmpYemldG etc.), which makes my root partition to run out of space.\n\n\n*\n\n*The folder to sync is about 3.5 GB and all that is copied to /tmp. Why U1 doesn't sync \"in place\" doing compression on-the-fly? If I had, say 20 GB to sync, U1 would attempt to copy all of it to /tmp?\n\n*Can I limit the amount of data copied to /tmp? While U1 is so terribly slow it doesn't really need more than it can handle. Even if the files to be synced have to be deflated to disk (which I doubt), this should be a small cache not the whole thing.\n\nA: After four days I resorted to a final solution and disabled Ubuntu One sync daemon. This freed the /tmp and returned my system to a usable state again. This is the only way to solve this problem, I'm afraid.\nU1, when running, is a hog on CPU and memory (and disk space in /tmp when creating a snapshot). Its hunger renders my 11.04 amd64 running on AMD Turion 64 X2 with 2 GB of ram unusable to a point in which I'm unable to send an email due to a lack of free space on root partition where my /tmp lives.\nU1 effectively duplicates all files and folders scheduled for sync, which is unacceptable for me. I don't need a local copy of my files, I want them to be in the cloud. That's what a remote backup is about. Sorry U1, you failed.\n\nA: That's not possible. It is necessary to make the switch in one go in order to provide any kind of conflict handling. Otherwise, you might suddenly end up with broken files if there was a power outage, etc. When you reboot, then the broken file would be synced across your personal cloud. That's really not what you want. \nAnother case is when you edit a file on different computers. You would need to know what the current version is. Downloading a new version should not affect the old version until it's completely downloaded. Only then should it be replaced with the new version, and this should be done in one go, probably by renaming the file. \n\nA: This is actually a bug that existed in 10.10.\nBug #823647\nI am seeing the exact same behavior in 10.10.  When attempting to sync a ~3 GB file it fills up my 42GB / partition via huge files in /tmp.  UbuntuOne sync is broken.\nDwain\n", "Q: What happened with message notifications from Empathy? I notice that some changes have been made in message notifications from Empathy in 11.10.\nI open chat in Empathy with another user but when a message is received there are no notifications in the messages menu (only a pop-up window). \nIn 11.04 the \"mail icon\" in the message menu became blue and I could switch to chat with new messages using that menu. It was quite useful. \nIs there any way to return to the old notification behavior in the messages menu in 11.10?\n\nA: I believe this is related to this bug.\nI enabled empathy notifications by whitelisting the Empathy application.  This is not exactly restoring 11.04 behavior but it is a workaround until the bug is fixed.\nHere is how to accomplish this:\n~ $ gsettings get com.canonical.Unity.Panel systray-whitelist\n['JavaEmbeddedFrame', 'Mumble', 'Wine', 'hp-systray', 'Dropbox', 'scp-dbus-service', 'Skype']\n~ $ gsettings set com.canonical.Unity.Panel systray-whitelist \"['JavaEmbeddedFrame', 'Mumble', 'Wine', 'hp-systray', 'Dropbox', 'scp-dbus-service', 'Skype', 'empathy']\"\n\nYour initial list may look different than mine.  Take note of the double quotes around the output list when passed as input as well as the new entry for empathy.\nYou will need to log out and login again for the changes to take effect.\nNote: This is not ideal.  On my box, when the old notification area blinks, it looks like it's missing the correct icon, but at least I know I have messages waiting.  I am going to leave mine like this until they get Empathy working with the new notification area.\n\nA: It was becoming blue for sometime after new install, but stopped for no seemingly reason.\nI guess that's because ubuntu 11.10 has broken everything good that was there in Ubuntu to push this half-backed Unity POS upon users. :(\n", "Q: How to partition a disk for installing Ubuntu? Currently I'm running Vista on my laptop but it's getting slower each day, so I decide to install an Ubuntu on my laptop, while for some reason I still need to keep the Vista.\nRight now I have two disks under Vista: C:/ for the Vista system and installed software,\nD:/ for my personal data, e.g, music, movie, photo.\n\nI want to keep some of the personal data and delete something unnecessary to spare about 50GB space.\nSo my question is this: is there a way to 'cut' the free 50GB into a independent disk, say E:/, so I can install Ubuntu on it, while not affecting my Vista system?\n\nA: Ubuntu can manage the partitioning itself, it recognizes the windows and should prompt you with the   install ubuntu alongside windows.\nselecting this option, ubuntu will create a new partition for you automatically without harming windows nor your data.\nafter you select that option, you will see a SLIDER. where you can move it, in order to increase the amount of drive you want ubuntu or windows to have. and you are done.\nplease note:\n\n\n*\n\n*you can access your windows files from ubuntu. but you can't access ubuntu files from windows. possible but not easy.\n\n*make sure you delete all the unwanted files on windows, so you can have more space for ubuntu.\n\n*you can do the partitioning manually also. to customize your /home partition or /boot or the swap partition. but if this is the first time you use ubuntu i reccomend the automatic one. \n\n*you can still enlarge or make partitions smaller after the install with the live cd and gparted. so don't worry.\n\n\ngood luck.\n\nA: Yes. It is perfectly possible to install Ubuntu next to Windows. You would have to cut free enough space for the installation, that's right and it could be wise to have this space free on one partition. The Installer on the Ubuntu-CD shows the Option to install Ubuntu alongside to Windows, so this is not really difficult. You also don't need 50 gB of free disk space, even 10 Gb would be completely sufficient and you can access the data stored on your Windows Partitions from Ubuntu, for accessing you Ubuntu data on your Windows Vista you need to install a free 3rd party driver and after that you will be able to see your Ubuntu partitions on Windows Vista.\nAlso note, that you don't have to make an E:\\ partition, since Linux uses different filesystems than Windows. The Ubuntu Installer will make the right kind of Partition by default.\nGood luck installing Ubuntu\n\nA: Yes! There is a way... I'll guide you through the procedure... Here goes...\nU can do all of the Hard Drive Re-sizing, Partitioning without loosing data using a Propitiatory Software for Windows with which you can literally control your NTFS/FAT Partitions. Its called EASEUS Partition Master v5.5 Pro. How to get it? You'll have to work out that. Its not that hard to find it.\nOnce u have the software, make your Hard drive look like something like what I've shown Below.\n\n[······300000 MB······] [··········1000000 MB··········] [····200000 MB·····]\n   Windows XP              Data             FREE Space\n      NTFS                 NTFS            (for Ubuntu)\n\n\n\nOnce you have 20-25 GB, delete the partition i.e. your marking it as free space. Once done you can go ahead with Ubuntu installation in this way.\nBoot from Live CD and start the Installation.\nDuring Installation Select Specify Partitions Manually. To begin creating partitions, select the free space and click on the Add… button.\n\n\n*\n\n*Click on the \"Add\" button. In the new window, type 2048 in the \"New partition size in megabytes\" field and select the \"swap area\" option from the \"Use as:\" list. Click the OK button (your swap area should be twice your ram size - Recommended). \n\n*Now, click on the \"Add\" button. In the new window, select the \"Primary\" option, input a value between 8,000 and 20,000 in the \"New partition size in megabytes\" field and select / as the \"Mount point.\" Click the OK button. \n\n*Click on the “Add” button again and from the new window and select the \"Primary\" option, type in whatever space you have left in your hard disk in the \"New partition size in megabytes\" field. And select /home as the \"Mount point\". Click the OK button. You are done with the hard part.\n\nClick \"Install Now\" to proceed with the installation process.\n\nA: It's definitely possible. Windows can even do the job:\nhttp://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows-vista/Can-I-repartition-my-hard-disk\nYou might have a problem with your c-drive though. It wont shrink while you have your page file on there, so you will have to disable that temporarily while shrinking.\n\nA: Yes. You can resize that partition using Windows disk manager or by running GParted from Live Ubuntu CD. \nFor Gparted look here\nhttp://www.howtogeek.com/howto/windows-vista/using-gparted-to-resize-your-windows-vista-partition/\nand for using Windows Vista disk manager follow instructions here\nhttp://www.mydigitallife.info/change-or-resize-partition-ntfs-fat-or-fat32-size-in-windows-vista/\n", "Q: Wireless driver working as ethernet? (ubuntu 11.04) I haven't very affinity with Networking/LAN, so I do not quite understand what's going on with my wireless driver, that's why I came here for help. My drive does not find any working wireless connection until I plug a network cable in. If I do this, it find working wireless connections and even if I plug the cable off, it stills on by wireless normally. So, I found this quite strange but this is it.\nI typed 'ifconfig' in linux terminal and it returned 3 network interfaces: eth0, eth1 and lo. The eth1 is being displayed as Ethernet, but actually this is the wireless, I know this because if I turn wireless off(by laptop multimedia function Fn+F2) eth1 just disappears and i'm disconnected from internet.\nSo this is it. Is there some way to configure the wireless driver by any ifconfig command line? Or is there some other way to fix it?\nThanks!\nP.S: Going to menu System > Administration > Additional drivers, it says I'm using Broadcom 802.11 Linux STA wireless driver.\n\nA: We might see ethernet and wireless as different types of network devices but they are both actually ethernet devices. On my motherboard I have two ethernet ports and an additional wireless adapter card. The ifconfig command lists all three as ethernet. See the line for wlan0.\n\nwlan0     Link encap:Ethernet\n\nI conclude that the wireless adapter/card is an ethernet device with an electronic circuit that receives and transmits using radio.\nThat, I think that answers the question in your title. Why you need to plug in an ethernet cable to get a wireless connection is a different question that could turn this post into a discussion. How many ethernet ports do you have? Is there a setting in the BIOS that links eth0 to eth1? Do you have another Operating System installed and is it affecting the operation of you network devices?\nWhen you click the network icon is there a tick mark against both Enable Networking and Enable Wireless? When you put in the cable do you then click Enable Networking and do you click it again to remove the tick mark when you want to disconnect from the router? Doing this switches networking on and off and that includes wireless networking. This could be why it seems that you need to plug in an ethernet cable to get wireless networking. \nClicking Enable Networking to put a tick mark alongside it will activate Enable Wireless if it already has a tick mark against it. Put tick marks against both Enable Networking and Enable Wireless and leave them there and go to Edit Connections and set your wireless connection to connect automatically.\nRegards.\n", "Q: Is there a way to active 3d on a Geforce Go 7400?

I keep my laptop on the left of my screen for various reasons. In order to get this to work I have the laptop screen set up to be to the right of the LCD. Therefore the Unity launcher will appear on the large LCD which is my main workspace. Obviously I have to remember to move windows to the right if I want them to be on the left hand screen.\n\nA: I hope this solves the problem for you. \nMy problem was that I'm running 11.10 in a HP 13\" laptop with a docking station. When in my desk, I close the laptop lid and the Launcher disappeared into the invisible fixed monitor. \nMy solution was this; System Settings (Configuración del Sistema) > Monitors (Monitores).

This assumes the monitors are the same making it easy to do this.\n\nA: You may be able to change the relative position of your monitors.  \nWith the Nvidia tweaker dohickey, you can set this in the X server Display Configuration section.  Typically the primary monitor is configured to be at 0,0 and the other one's position can be specified relative to the first.  By combining this with playing with which monitor is plugged into which port on the tower, you might be able to get it working sensibly and the way you want it to.\n\nA: I use a dual boot Windows / Ubuntu  Media PC with a regular monitor and a TV attached. The idea has always been to watch the videos of recorded TV on the TV  and do other stuff on the monitor which is to the right of that (the TV sits in the centre of the room for optimum viewing). \nIt seemed natural  to me to set things up using the Nvidia tweaker to match that, with the TV on the left, so that the mouse would move as expected. when moved off the left of the monitor. Under Ubuntu 11.04 I could do that AND have the launcher at the left of the primary display - the monitor. However that doesn't happen with 11.10 and now I know why. \nFor me the ideal would be RIGHT instead of LEFT because then the launcher would be as far away as possible from the TV. The software isn't up to moving the launcher just yet. I've searched for alternatives and it is possible to set it at the BOTTOM of the screen using something called ADeskBar and another way via a Compiz plugin, but neither is very helpful. It would be good if this woul;d be something fixed in the next release.\nIf something can't be fixed exactly the way you want it, the next best thing is a workaround:\n\n\n*\n\n*Move the monitor to the left only using the tweaker. The launcher will appear again on the screen but the right hand side of that display will lead counter intuitively to the TV (which is physically on the other side); or\n\n*Do the above AND swap the physical positions of the TV and monitor. The TV might be slightly less visible, but mouse will behave like you'd expect. \n\n\nLet's hope that the next version of the launcher lets you put it where you want, like the task bar in windows. \nMove the monitor to the left with the Nvidia tweaker.

I have set up puppet (Central Management Server). Can anyone tell me how to change wallpapers of all clients from this puppet server?\n\nA: To set the wallpaper image from command line (without puppet), you can use something like this:\ngsettings set org.gnome.desktop.background picture-uri \"file:///path/to/file.jpg\"\n\nwhich obviously needs to be run as the user you're changing the background for.\nIn terms of puppet, I believe you would be able to upload the file to the controlled machines using file resource:\nfile { \"/usr/share/backgrounds/warty-final-ubuntu.png\":\n   source => \"puppet://server/modules/module_name/background.jpg\" \n}\n\nthen, to run a command, there's exec directive:\ndefine set_bg($name) {\n    exec {\"set bg for $name\":\n        command => \"/usr/bin/gsettings set org.gnome.desktop.background picture-uri file:///usr/share/backgrounds/warty-final-ubuntu.png\",\n        user => \"$name\",\n    }\n}\n\nwhich you can execute for each of your users:\nuser { \"joe\":\n  ensure      =>  \"present\",\n  uid         =>  \"1005\",\n  comment     =>  \"Joe\",\n  home        =>  \"/home/joe\",\n  shell       =>  \"/bin/bash\",\n  managehome  =>  \"true\"\n} \n\nuser { \"ted\":\n  ensure      =>  \"present\", \n  uid         =>  \"1006\", \n  comment     =>  \"Ted\",\n  home        =>  \"/home/ted\",\n  shell       =>  \"/bin/bash\",\n  managehome  =>  \"true\"\n} \n\nset_bg { \"joe\": name=>\"joe\" }\nset_bg { \"ted\": name=>\"ted\" }\n\nAlso, you may want to restrict user's choice of backgrounds only to the one you're setting with Puppet. For that, you need to modify /usr/share/gnome-background-properties/ubuntu-wallpapers.xml (obviously, using Puppet). The file itself would look like:\n<?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"UTF-8\"?>\n<!DOCTYPE wallpapers SYSTEM \"gnome-wp-list.dtd\">\n<wallpapers>\n   <wallpaper>\n    <name>Common Background</name>\n    <filename>/usr/share/backgrounds/warty-final-ubuntu.png</filename>\n    <options>zoom</options>\n    <pcolor>#000000</pcolor>\n    <scolor>#000000</scolor>\n    <shade_type>solid</shade_type>\n   </wallpaper>\n</wallpapers>\n\nThe rule to upload it would look like:\nfile { \"/usr/share/gnome-background-properties/ubuntu-wallpapers.xml\":\n   source => \"puppet://server/modules/module_name/backgrounds.xml\",\n}\n\nAlso, note that the default Ubuntu background is in the file /usr/share/backgrounds/warty-final-ubuntu.png - I'm finding that replacing this file gives more predictable results then creating another one (i.e. gsettings is unable to change background for new users who never logged in, for example). This also changes the background of the login screen etc, which I suppose is a good thing.\n\nA: On Oneiric :\nWallpaper settings have been moved to dconf ; all settings must be changed with D-Bus calls.\nTherefore to achieve this with puppet you'll need a puppet D-Bus module, and to use it to send calls as described below.\nYou can gather information on which D-Bus calls to use, using the dbus-monitor application to watch what happens when you change wallpaper.\nSee also How to modify the system default background image for detail on how to configure the default available wallpaper.\n\nmethod call sender=:1.2153 -> dest=ca.desrt.dconf serial=44 path=/ca/desrt/dconf/Writer/user; interface=ca.desrt.dconf.Writer; member=WriteMany\n   string \"/org/gnome/desktop/background/\"\n   array [\n      struct {\n         string \"color-shading-type\"\n         array [\n            variant                string \"solid\"\n         ]\n      }\n      struct {\n         string \"picture-options\"\n         array [\n            variant                string \"zoom\"\n         ]\n      }\n      struct {\n         string \"picture-uri\"\n         array [\n            variant                string \"file:///usr/share/themes/Adwaita/backgrounds/stripes.jpg\"\n         ]\n      }\n      struct {\n         string \"primary-color\"\n         array [\n            variant                string \"#3465a4\"\n         ]\n      }\n   ]\nmethod call sender=:1.2153 -> dest=ca.desrt.dconf serial=45 path=/ca/desrt/dconf/Writer/user; interface=ca.desrt.dconf.Writer; member=WriteMany\n   string \"/org/gnome/desktop/background/\"\n   array [\n      struct {\n         string \"picture-options\"\n         array [\n            variant                string \"zoom\"\n         ]\n      }\n   ]\n", "Q: Losing minimized app instances Ok, to start off, I'm running Ubuntu 11.10 (beta) on my 2010 Macbook.\nThe problem I'm having is that when I have multiple instances of an application running and I minimize one I lose it.

This way, you won't download common packages more than 1 time from official repositories.\nHere is the situation, we have one machine called repository-cache, this machine is going to act as the repository cache, basically, any other machines in your network is going to use it as a repository.\n1. How To Set up a repository cache with apt-cacher\nHow To Set up a repository cache with apt-cacher\n2. Conclusion\napt-cacher is an easy and efficient package which will save you both time and bandwidth when using multiple machines with the same distribution like it could happen in a home network or in at a company. \n\napt-mirror\nIt is a perl-based utility for downloading and mirroring the entire contents of a public repository. This may likely include packages that you don't use and will not use, but anything stored in a public repository will also be stored in your mirror.\n1. How To Set up a repository cache with apt-cacher\nTo configure apt-mirror you will need the following:\napt-mirror package `sudo apt-get install apt-mirror`\napache2 package  `sudo apt-get install apache2`\n**roughly 15G of storage per release, per architecture**\n\nHow to Set up a repository with apt-mirror\n2. Conclusion\nI find this difficult but very effective in saving bandwidth but on the other side the results is a high consumption of disk space.\n\napt-cacher-ng \nis a caching proxy for downloading packages from Debian-style\n software repositories (or possibly from other types).\nThe main principle is that a central machine hosts the proxy for a local\n network, and clients configure their APT setup to download through it.\n Apt-Cacher NG keeps a copy of all useful data that passes through it, and when\n a similar request is made, the cached copy of the data is delivered without\n being re-downloaded.\nApt-Cacher NG has been designed from scratch as a replacement for\n apt-cacher, but with a focus on maximizing throughput with low system\n resource requirements. It can also be used as replacement for apt-proxy and\n approx with no need to modify clients' sources.list files.\n2. Conclusion\nis a caching proxy specialized for package files from GNU/Linux distributors, primarily for Debian and Debian based distributions (like Ubuntu). This means that if you have many Debian/Ubuntu machines on your network, you just have to download the deb packages (new software, updates, distro upgrades, etc) from the internet once and the rest of the Debian/Ubuntu machines get them from Apt-Cacher NG cache, saving time and internet bandwidth. \nNext time any of your machines needs a deb package, it will ask Apt-Cacher NG for it. If this package was asked previously by any of the other machines, Apt-Cacher will have a copy and will deliver it. Otherwise, it will fetch it from the internet repositories, keep a local copy and deliver it.\nBest way to cache apt downloads on a LAN? see Piskvor's answer \nLet do it some markeying in Full Circle Issue #54 there is an interesting article about Part 2, Apt-Cache NG\n\nA: Using apt-cacher-ng could be an alternative. You can find the manual here.\n\nA: Apt-Cacher is a caching proxy. This means it just caches every downloaded package, whether it will be used by Ubuntu 10.04, 10.10 or whatever.

I didn't purchase HDD yet, so I tried to install ubuntu on the SDHC card. But it's terribly slow! I would expect it to be faster than normal 5400rpm hdd, since seek times on any flash memory is low.\nPc details: 2gb ddr3 ram, 1.8 dual core atom, asrock d525 mobo, and 8gb SD card. In theory this should be more than enough for ubuntu.\nBut, few things worry me. First of all I believe I connected card reader to usb port. So that would limit speed. In the face of the fact that reader resides on usb, is this slowness expected?\nI ran ubuntu test suit, and on hdd it reported reading speed 800mb/s.\nHow should I check device speed? Is there any other way?\n\nA: The USB 2.0 speed is probably not even the bottleneck, but most SD cards and card readers are really slow.\nYou could try to use palimpsest to measure the speed, although when I tried it with an SD card it said that the drive is too slow to even measure it.\n\nA: Hard drives just about always have caches, typically 8 GB but often much larger.  \nThey have both read-ahead and write-behind caches.  The read-ahead will read the next few blocks after a a block was just read in anticipation of them being read in the near future, but will remove them from the cache if they don't get read before the cache fills up with other block.\nYour SDHC card probably has no cache at all.  While it would benefit from the fast seek times, you would be seeing the direct read and write behavior of the flash.\nWriting flash is very slow because it must be erased and then written to in a second pass.\nFlash wears out when you write to it too many times.  Once you've done so it won't store data reliably.  To prolong the life, wear leveling is used in which the physical sector used to store a logical sector number constantly changes.  Thus there is effectively a filesystem underneath the filesystem that Linux actually sees.  \nThe wear leveling is implemented by the hardware of your SDHC card and may not be implemented with very fast circuitry.\nFlash can be made very, very fast as with solid state drives with SATA or SAS (Serial Attached SCSI) interfaces, but I expect those drives do have large RAM caches as well as faster wear leveling hardware.\n\nA: SD cards are rated for different speeds.  If you don't still have the packaging for your card, you could look it up at the manufacturer's website.\nI recently bought a 16 GB MicroSDHC card to run Linux on my Gumstix Overo Fire ARM board.  It's a very high-speed card as they go, I think it was called a Class 10 or some such.  That's a lot bigger card that your typical ARM Linux requires but I wanted lots of room for my own data.\nAre you making your NAS out of a PC motherboard?  Or did you buy a ready-made NAS?  In either case, your USB port might only be USB 1.1.  If so it will work for storage, but it will be quite slow.  I would expect all of today's motherboards to be either USB 2.0 or 3.0, but if it's a NAS you bought that you're not making out of PC components, the chances are pretty good that it's a 1.1 port just meant for attaching a keyboard and mouse.\n\nA: Even if your NAS has a USB 2 or USB 3 port, your card reader might only have a USB 1.1 port.  If that were the case it would be very slow.  You could speed it up by using a USB 2 or 3 card reader.  \nHowever I've bought two card readers, and I don't recall the USB version being specified on the packaging for either of them.

Of course the latest version have more problems but older versions will still several power related issues.\nHardware Problems\nWithout mentioning EVERY LINK that mentions problems about hardware for the Sandy Bridge you could do a google search just for Sandy Bridge and you will see several of them. some of which are:\nhttp://www.phoronix.com - Which mentions power regressions, video problems and cpu problems.\nhttp://hardware.slashdot.org/ - which mentions really big heat problems\nhttp://www.pcmag.com/article2/0,2817,2379241,00.asp#fbid=xZbYR5U-2nn - Mentions some of the hardware problems related to Sandy Bridge. Some of which have been solved.\nBasically you discovered one of several problems related to a chipset/cpu/kernel problem.\nSounds horrible I know (Me being an Intel follower) but am hoping that Ivy Bridge will solve this with not only eliminating all video/chipset/cpu problems but adding new technology that guarantees that we will not see this horrible problem.\n", "Q: When you type out an application name, do you need to click on one of the suggestions using your mouse?

This morning on my laptop I ran Update Manager (I'm running 11.04) and I received a message that I could only run a partial update.  Being fairly new to Ubuntu, I wasn't sure what I should do, but it appeared to want to do some updates but not all, and even remove some things.  It gave several possible reasons for this, one of them being that this might occur with a \"pre-release version.\"  Since 11.10 is coming out next week, I figured that might be the cause, so I had it go ahead.\nA few hours later, I ran Update Manager on my desktop computer, and was presented with the same choice.  Since it appeared to have worked on my desktop, I chose to let it apply the \"partial update\", too.  \nSince then, on both computers, I've noticed a few little bugs.  Nothing big, but nothing I had been previously experiencing.  And in the history folder of the Software Center, no updates are listed as having been applied today.\nSo my question is, what does it mean when Update Manager wants to run a partial update?  Is it better not to accept it (and thus not do any updates)?\n\nA: Summary\nor \"I don't really care if I keep messing things up and wasting my and others' time with preventable problems, and you have 30 seconds to convince me to care!\"\nIf you use Update Manager to upgrade your packages, and it offers to do a \"Partial Upgrade\", do not accept it without thoroughly checking what packages it offers to remove, upgrade and install. If you do, you will most likely end up removing packages that shouldn't be removed, and waste time and effort repairing your installation and asking for assistance.\nMost \"Partial Upgrade\" situations occur due to package archive inconsistencies, which will typically be resolved within a few hours. If your package manager is confused, and so are you, simply wait and hold off the updates until things settle down.\nShort Version\nor \"Hmm, so I shouldn't blindly do \"Partial Upgrade\"s and dist-upgrade? I didn't know that...\"\nDue to the fact that uploads & replications to mirror repositories are sometimes not synchronous, dependencies of certain packages may arrive later than the dependent package. This causes package management tools such as Update Manager to interpret the situation as requiring a dist-upgrade to install new packages and/or repair packages in a \"reqreinst\" (requires reinstallation) state. What Update Manager performs when doing a \"Partial Upgrade\" is a dist-upgrade.\nMost of the time, a \"Partial Upgrade\" is undesired. The situations where it's needed are limited to new packages obsoleting old ones (as in the case of the software-center package replacing software-store) and package removals from the archive.\nLong Version\nor \"I think I know what I'm doing! Tell me more!\"\nIn its normal operating mode, Update Manager will not offer to remove packages. This is the equivalent of \"apt-get upgrade\"ing your existing packages. In \"Partial Upgrade\" mode, it can. Sometimes, the removal is warranted, such as when a package is obsoleted by a new one. Other times, it will not be, and a \"Partial Upgrade\" can offer to remove important packages due to missing dependencies.\nNow, the key question:\n\"How do I know whether a package is actually meant to be replaced or removed?\"\nThere's more than one way:\n\n\n*\n\n*Check the changelog of the package in question. You can do this via \"Package > Download Changelog\" in Synaptic, or \"aptitude changelog package_name\", or by going to packages.ubuntu.com and clicking \"Ubuntu changelog\" for the package you're curious about, or visiting the URL\nhttps://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/package_name/+changelog\n\n*where package_name is the name of the source package you're curious about. The most recent changelog entry will indicate the reason for the removal or replacement, if there is one.\nFor an example scenario of using the list of recent changes to determine whether a package removal and \"Partial Upgrade\" is safe, refer to the next post.\n\n*Check the build status information page for Ubuntu and the queue of new uploads to the Ubuntu release (e.g. Natty) on Launchpad to see if those mysterious missing dependencies are coming down the pipes, or there are problems preventing them from being built.\n\n*Do a forum search/AskUbuntu, or join the #ubuntu+1 channel on irc.freenode.net and ask around to see whether other people are having problems with the same package(s).\n\n*If you're still confused, simply wait and see if things are magically fixed within a few hours. If not, start a new thread or post to an existing one on the same issue to check with others.\nA typical interaction with a package manager involves the following three steps:\n\n\n*\n\n*You select some packages to be installed / removed / upgraded\n\n*The package manager resolves your intention according to its package management logic, the available software sources, and the priorities you've indicated (as in APT pinning), if any, to a set of actions it has to perform, and outputs a list of those actions\n\n*You check this list, confirm it if you're happy with it, or cancel it and refine your selection until you're happy with it.\nIf you skip the third step, assuming that simply updating your package information and hitting \"Apply\" or pressing \"Enter\" when the prompt comes up will give you the latest changes - you'll break your installation unnecessarily. Don't do that.

FireWire, USB, I'm pretty sure Fiber Channel and most RAIDs are considered to be SCSI as well.\nThe problem with SCSI is that the Linux kernel does not guarantee the drive order in any particular way.  I expect your problem is that Ubuntu and Fedora are running different kernels, and that something about those different kernels is changing your drive order.\nYour root partitions for both OSes are labeled with GUIDs.  I do not know: is it possible to have grub look for the GUIDs instead of the hd0 or hd1?\nThe hd number is supposed to be the BIOS drive number.  If you only had one partition on each drive, then hd0 would be the DOS C: drive while hd1 would be the DOS D: drive, as DOS uses the BIOS to find the drives, rather than going through a kernel and device driver.\nIf you can figure out why your BIOS drives are in different orders under each OS then I think your problem will be solved.  So while I have not answered your question, maybe I have given you some helpful clues.\n", "Q: How to show day/month number of events in datetime indicator? I configured the datetime indicator to show upcoming Evolution events.\nI'm using Ubuntu 11.04 but it is the same with 11.10.\nThere is a way to show number of day and month in events list, and not only the day name? Without this the list is very confusing because I see \"saturday\" but don't understand if it's the next, or more later.\nLook at this screenshot:\n\nFor the \"JoomlaDay\" event, I wish to see \"sab 22/10 9.00\" or could be OK also \"sab 22 ott 9.00\".\n\nA: Are you using gnome shell or unity ?\nin unity it's an option to enable from the applet settings.\nin gnome 3 shell I was not able to do it.\nOtherwise in system setting, \"date and time\"... or change the applet.\n", "Q: Cheapest phone which can plug and play into ubuntu for tethering? Can someone please show me a very very very cheap phone which I can plug into my laptop which uses Ubuntu 10.04 so I can use the phone as a modem, i.e. tethering the data allowance on my contract.\nThe phone must be very cheap\nIt must simply be plug and play, no configuring\nIt must be unlocked, or free to unlock or cost less than £60 including the cost to unlock it\nI understand that android 2.2 phones fit the above requirements except the 3rd requirement afaik.  The cheapest android phone I have found is about £60, but costs about £30 to unlock.\n\nA: A few options I can think of:\n1 - Get a 3G dongle instead.  There is a monthly cost associated, but it is a device for this very purpose.  You will need to look at the compatibility of specific dongles with Ubuntu.\n2 - Check ebay for 2nd hand phones, it is possible that you find cheap Android phones there.\n", "Q: How do I set the Banshee context menu to move to trash instead of delete from drive? I am using Banshee as my media player.  When I right click a track, the context menu has a 'delete from drive' option.  When I use this, it deletes the file.  I would like for the file to be sent to trash (recycle bin) instead.  Is there a way to do this, or a plugin or extension for this? \n\n\nA: Unfortunately, there's currently no way to do this within Banshee. I don't know of any extensions that add this functionality -- it may be out of the scope of an extension.\nIt has been reported to the Banshee team, though, so if you're interested in staying up-to-date with the issue, it's tracked here: https://bugzilla.gnome.org/show_bug.cgi?id=545937\n", "Q: microsoft office not properly working in wine I had installed Microsoft Office through Wine on my Ubuntu Desktop.\nWhen I close my opened Microsoft word document, I was shown a dialog box that shows Microsoft Office Word has encountered a problem.\nAlso, When I try to open Microsoft Powerpoint, I get a message that Microsoft Powerpoint failed to start in safe mode.\nThen I moved to skydrive with my hotmail account.\nBut Is there any solution to this problem?\n\nA: Probably not.\nWine is a lot different from virtualizing. From this link and the links to the specific programs, I'd say that 2007 shouldn't give you too many problems. What problems others have had is listed under the specific versions of each program.\n", "Q: How do I install Tibesti Screencaster?

I have just installed Ubuntu 11.04 along with my existing Vista and I see no boot menu for it on start up.\nI Googled for it and got the answer that let me modify the grub file and then execute update-grub to solve it.\nBut all of this has be to done AFTER you can get into the system right?\nMy question is how can I even get into the Ubuntu system if there's no boot menu ? I tried pressing SHIFT during boot, but the screen then became still untill I released it and then boot into Vista.\nI installed Ubuntu with USB stick, but I see no option of doing this on its menu.\n\nA: There is an Ubuntu help page about this.  You don't have to boot into Ubuntu for this, you can do this from a live CD/live USB.  The gist is that you load it up, mount your hard disk, update grub, and that should then present you with the Grub menu the next time you start the machine.  \n\nA: If you installed Ubuntu on your HD and you have never been able to boot it. (Which is implied, when you say, that you don't see the menu after the setup screen at startup)  then you should most likely install it again over the existing ubuntu partition. There is an Option in the installer to install the new ubuntu in place of the old ubuntu. It sounds like the installation of ubuntu is somehow messed up. \nIf you have already used the ubuntu installation, then you can try to repair grub or you backup your files with a live cd and install it anew.\nWell I know it's not an elegant solution, but it is simple and pretty straightforward. ;)\n\nA: Another option is to use easybcd from neosoft as the bootloader modification tool.\nThis will use the Windows bootloader instead of grub or grub2 as the main bootloader.  The result is that you are chainloading so after the Windows bootloader menu if you choose Ubuntu it will take you to the grub menu.  There is a way to set the timout to zero there in order to speed the bootup.  I have one PC using this methond and a different one that uses grub.  As a relative beginner I do not see much difference between these two options as far as functionality.\n", "Q: How to get the GNOME 3 login manager installed? I was wondering if it is possible to get the GNOME 3.2 GDM login theme working on Ubuntu 11.10. I installed GDM alongside LightDM, but the GDM greeter is really ugly. \n\n\nA: Tista and three other dev's have done just this (see link below).\nTista has created a testing PPA to install GDM 3.2 - this is the version of the login manager which you can theme via CSS.\n\nWarning - this is a testing PPA\nAt the time of writing this, there are only packages for Precise (12.04)\nI originally tested this on a 11.10 virtual machine when a package existed - hence the screenshot:\nI've since retested this on 12.04 - Important - see the notes below\nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:tista/gdm-testing\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get install gdm  libgdmgreeter1 libgdmsimplegreeter1 gir1.2-gdmgreeter-1.0\n\nsource\nDuring the installation of GDM you will be asked which display-manager you want to run.  Choose GDM and press ENTER\nReboot\nchanging the background\nTo change the background, use the AU linked question below to change the background.\nThe Gnome-shell stripes background can be found on GitHub.\nIssues\n\n\n*\n\n*Whilst there is a package for Precise (12.04), I personally haven't managed to get this to work correctly (left me at a blank screen with no login manager).  Thus - it may or may not work for you - obviously it must work for the PPA developer!  If you are left with a blank screen, use CTRL+ALT+F2 to log into a TTY and use this Q&A to switch back to lightDM\n\n*Since this is GDM - it does not appear to work with Unity.  It does work with Gnome-Shell. For Unity, a blank background is seen.  You have to use CTRL+ALT+T to launch a terminal and then type unity --reset to get the unity desktop to display.  I'm open to suggestions why this happens and if there is a workaround...\n\n*If you logout and attempt to login again - Gnome-Shell very occasionally not start and you will be left with an empty desktop.\n\n\n\nLinks:\n\n\n*\n\n*Discussion of implementation of GDM 3.2\n\n*How to set gtk-style and background in GDM3\n\nA: :)\nI'm an owner of this ppa. and thanks for your experimental trials on it.\nAnd now... umm... I've heard some issues on this release maybe both on precise/oneiric:\n\n\n*\n\n*plymouth stands/stacks still on vt7 and gdm was wiped to vt8.\n\n\n*\n\n*I think it might be caused my patchworks based on debian's patches. Yeah since my patch would seek \"free\" and \"opened\" vt automatically...\n\n\n*Lots of keyring after logging in, would be asked in every time.\n\n\n*\n\n*I didn't have any clue about it, so sorry for that. I've tried some upstream git sources to apply newer PAM auth, but it didn't make any sense because of its target would be always fedora/redhat platform, so ubuntu/debian might be needed some more patchworks...\n\n\n*Especially on precise, \"repack\" of ureadahead might be needed when we had changed daemons/pre-processes before starting gdm.\n\n\n*\n\n*I've experienced some ugly situations whenever I've changed system configurations to tune it, gdm could not start and we would be stayed alone in vt7 console. I had not any clue as well. :/\n\n\n\nFinally if someone who wants to fight against this work (especially patchworks), let me know your trials/patches!! :-)\n\nA: You should try this link GDM Theme.

Hello I am curious if Ubuntu 11.10 will get Kernel 3.1 via updates when it hits stable release?\n\nA: You can check the current status of the included kernel at \n\n\n*\n\n*http://packages.ubuntu.com/oneiric/linux-image and/or \n\n*https://wiki.ubuntu.com/KernelTeam/ReleaseStatus/Oneiric . \n\n\nSince oneiric is scheduled to be released in less than a week, it will likely come with a 3.0 kernel. If you want to install 3.1, you can do so from the kernel team's ppa.\n\nA: In addition to phihag's links, the kernel version was announced to the ubuntu development list as being 3.0\n", "Q: How can I change what time Deja Dup does its backup? I believe it automatically runs at midnight, but I would rather it run during an off-peak internet period to save my quota.\nHow can I change the time it runs? \n\nA: That feature is on the wishlist, for now you can try setting the schedule to monthly in the preferences and setup your own schedule using crontab and deja-dup --backup.\n", "Q: Recover files without an extension after deleting them with a BASH command Last night, I used exiftool to batch rename a collection of .mov files. Some of the files were renamed as required, but many of them were left without an extension.\nI think the required EXIF tag that I used in the exiftool command was missing from some the files, resulting in ~140 .mov files renamed in a timestamp format without an extension.\nRather than manually appending .mov to each file, I searched Google for a script to automate the process. I adapted an example and executed it (*+0100 refers to common string at the end of all the target files):\n$ for i in *+0100; do mv \"$i\" \"`basename $i *+0100`.mov\"; done\n\nFor some reason, ~140 files disappeared and I was left with a single file with a .mov extension. Not quite what I was expecting!\nI searched the partition with photorec, but I haven't been able to recover the files. Is there any other way I may be able to recover them? These particular family videos were some of the few that I had not yet backed up.\n\nA: See the DataRevovery. \nNext time, when you do such loops always add echo as a first command. After you see what you are about to do, remove the echo, and rerun. It's a common mistake - sorry.\n\nA: When I try that command I just get an error with basename, I think is was meant to be:\nfor i in *+0100; do mv \"$i\" \"`basename $i`.mov\"; done\n\nI don't think they can be recovered, but you can try extundelete.\n", "Q: Permission denied error when trying to install with wubi I run into problem when tried to install Ubuntu 11.04 on Windows 7 using wubi installer .\nIt downloads the image for sometime and ends up with the error that says \nPermission denied: for more details see the log file\nIn the log it seems to be like \nDownloadError: Problem connecting to tracker - urlopen error (10060, 'Operation timed out')\nbut my network is good and I checked it.\nTried using wubi several times, but ends up with same problem.\nLog content:\n10-08 16:56 DEBUG  TaskList: ### Finished get_metalink\n10-08 16:56 DEBUG  TaskList: New task download\n10-08 16:56 DEBUG  TaskList: ### Running download...\n10-08 16:56 DEBUG  btdownloader: downloading http://releases.ubuntu.com/11.04/ubuntu-11.04-desktop-amd64.iso.torrent > C:\\ubuntu\\install\\ubuntu-11.04-desktop-amd64.iso\n10-08 18:02 ERROR  TaskList: Traceback (most recent call last):\n  File \"\\lib\\bittorrent\\RawServer.py\", line 229, in listen_forever\n  File \"\\lib\\wubi\\backends\\common\\btdownloader.py\", line 70, in error_callback\nDownloadError: Traceback (most recent call last):\n  File \"\\lib\\bittorrent\\RawServer.py\", line 221, in listen_forever\n  File \"\\lib\\bittorrent\\Rerequester.py\", line 96, in fail\n  File \"\\lib\\wubi\\backends\\common\\btdownloader.py\", line 70, in error_callback\nDownloadError: Problem connecting to tracker - urlopen error (10060, 'Operation timed out')\n\nTraceback (most recent call last):\n  File \"\\lib\\wubi\\backends\\common\\tasklist.py\", line 197, in __call__\n  File \"\\lib\\wubi\\backends\\common\\btdownloader.py\", line 79, in download\n  File \"\\lib\\bittorrent\\download.py\", line 303, in download\n  File \"\\lib\\bittorrent\\RawServer.py\", line 256, in listen_forever\n  File \"\\lib\\wubi\\backends\\common\\btdownloader.py\", line 70, in error_callback\nDownloadError: Traceback (most recent call last):\n  File \"\\lib\\bittorrent\\RawServer.py\", line 229, in listen_forever\n  File \"\\lib\\wubi\\backends\\common\\btdownloader.py\", line 70, in error_callback\nDownloadError: Traceback (most recent call last):\n  File \"\\lib\\bittorrent\\RawServer.py\", line 221, in listen_forever\n  File \"\\lib\\bittorrent\\Rerequester.py\", line 96, in fail\n  File \"\\lib\\wubi\\backends\\common\\btdownloader.py\", line 70, in error_callback\nDownloadError: Problem connecting to tracker - urlopen error (10060, 'Operation timed out')\n\n\n10-08 18:02 ERROR  TaskList: Non fatal error Traceback (most recent call last):\n  File \"\\lib\\bittorrent\\RawServer.py\", line 229, in listen_forever\n  File \"\\lib\\wubi\\backends\\common\\btdownloader.py\", line 70, in error_callback\nDownloadError: Traceback (most recent call last):\n  File \"\\lib\\bittorrent\\RawServer.py\", line 221, in listen_forever\n  File \"\\lib\\bittorrent\\Rerequester.py\", line 96, in fail\n  File \"\\lib\\wubi\\backends\\common\\btdownloader.py\", line 70, in error_callback\nDownloadError: Problem connecting to tracker - urlopen error (10060, 'Operation timed out')\n\n in task download\n10-08 18:02 DEBUG  TaskList: ### Finished download\n10-08 18:02 ERROR  TaskList: [Errno 13] Permission denied: u'C:\\\\ubuntu\\\\install\\\\ubuntu-11.04-desktop-amd64.iso'\nTraceback (most recent call last):\n  File \"\\lib\\wubi\\backends\\common\\tasklist.py\", line 197, in __call__\n  File \"\\lib\\wubi\\backends\\common\\backend.py\", line 492, in get_iso\n  File \"\\lib\\wubi\\backends\\common\\backend.py\", line 347, in download_iso\nOSError: [Errno 13] Permission denied: u'C:\\\\ubuntu\\\\install\\\\ubuntu-11.04-desktop-amd64.iso'\n10-08 18:02 DEBUG  TaskList: # Cancelling tasklist\n10-08 18:02 DEBUG  TaskList: # Finished tasklist\n10-08 18:02 ERROR  root: [Errno 13] Permission denied: u'C:\\\\ubuntu\\\\install\\\\ubuntu-11.04-desktop-amd64.iso'\nTraceback (most recent call last):\n  File \"\\lib\\wubi\\application.py\", line 57, in run\n  File \"\\lib\\wubi\\application.py\", line 131, in select_task\n  File \"\\lib\\wubi\\application.py\", line 157, in run_installer\n  File \"\\lib\\wubi\\backends\\common\\tasklist.py\", line 197, in __call__\n  File \"\\lib\\wubi\\backends\\common\\backend.py\", line 492, in get_iso\n  File \"\\lib\\wubi\\backends\\common\\backend.py\", line 347, in download_iso\nOSError: [Errno 13] Permission denied: u'C:\\\\ubuntu\\\\install\\\\ubuntu-11.04-desktop-amd64.iso'\n\n\nA: Wubi is trying to download the desktop CD ISO for the install using a bittorrent client. It requires that pyrun.exe (the python runtime that Wubi uses) be given permission to your windows firewall. If you granted pyrun.exe firewall access (there would have been a popup asking permission) then you may be blocked by an upstream firewall e.g. some colleges/universities block bittorrents.\nIf that's the case you should download the desktop CD iso yourself from http://www.ubuntu.com/download/ubuntu/download and save it in the same directory as wubi.exe before running (and Wubi will find it and use it).\n\nA: It worked for my by downloading the image and placing it in the same folder where the wubi.exe sits in. And one should not forget to disable network before executing this. It works smooth.\n\nA: I don't know which one will work, lets try several solution:\n1. run wubi.exe with right click [rus as administrator]\n2. Try to install ubuntu on another drive [if run as admin does not work][expect C]\n3. If you will get any disk error during wubi installation then just click continue several times. Surprisingly it works.\n\n\nA: Old Wubi versions have bugs but i have found a solution from a forum post at ubuntuforums.org i can't find the same post but i have the links to patched files.

I have Windows 7 as my main host OS, and then i installed Wubi Ubuntu 11.04. Later to this i installed a partition Ubuntu 11.10 ( beta 2). \nSo altogether i have Windows 7, 11.04 (Wubi) 11.10 beta 2\nNow basically what I want to do is move some files from the wubi installation via a USB and move them onto the Ubuntu 11.10 partition. And then I want to completely remove Wubi from my PC, without causing any issues with the grub or anything that will prevent booting\nThank you for any feedback guys :) \n\nA: Just go to Control Panel>>Add/Remove software and remove from there. It uninstalls like any application that you install in Windows. See https://wiki.ubuntu.com/WubiGuide\nIn the event that you have a boot problem, Boot-repair can usually sort it out. \nSee https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Boot-Repair\n", "Q: vi shortcut to delete \"until the next X character\" I understand that vi has shortcut keys to delete characters, words and lines with various options. \nHowever, I could not find this:\n\n\n*\n\n*delete from the cursor to the next specified character\n\n\nFor example, I might type du\" expecting the editor to \"delete until the next \" character is found\"\nThe closest I know is d9w where 9 is the number of words to delete.\nDoes anyone know if this is possible?\n\nA: *\n\n*To delete forward up to character 'X'  type dtX\n\n*To delete forward through character 'X'  type dfX\n\n*To delete backward up to character 'X'  type dTX\n\n*To delete backward through character 'X'  type dFX\n\nA: w moves to the following word. l moves to the following charactor.\nSo it's d9l to delete the next 9 characters.\n\nA: Use dtc, where c is any character, e.g. for you, you want dt\"\nThis will delete upto but not including c.\nIf you had:\ndelete until exclamation point!\n\nAnd the cursor was at the first space and you typed dt!, you would get:\ndelete!\n\nAlso dfc.  \nThis will delete upto and including c.  \nUsing df! on the same example above would give you:\ndelete\n\nJust about any \"motion\" can be used for the d, c, y and similar commands.\n\nA: The input dt# (not a :command, use it like a movement like G)\nwill delete from the cursor until but not including the #. You can substitute any char for #.  \n\nA: I suggest use delete with pattern,\nd/<pattern>\nd is action delete\n/ is vim searching sign\nfor example, the following is a MySQL connection string. I want to change to the password redhat to new one\nroot:redhat@tcp(localhost:3306)/?parseTime=True\nIn command mode , I click w(skip to next word), the cursor move to \":\", click w again will move the cursor to first char r of password redhat. now click d/@ will delete the any characters until @ that in this case will remove the redhat. d/@tcp is better if the string has more than one @, the pattern more paticular is more precise.\n\nA: It looks like @Arcege already answered the question, but I did d/l to delete until the character l; other characters would work as well.\n\nA: Nobody mentioned about that so I thought I would share this as well.\nIf you want to delete until a character you can use dt and type the desired character. If you want to delete until a character but the character is also in the middle for instance (hell(o) world) and you want to delete from hell(o) until the last ) and your cursor is on the h you can type a number, in this case 2dt) this will jump the first ).\nYou can also use de (delete end), here by \"end\" you have to think \"end of the word (not line)\" so if you want to delete for instance .world in (hello.world) and your cursor is on the dot, you can type de.\nHope it helps\n\nA: You can also do ct\" instead of dt\" do delete until \" and also enter insert mode, that is, dt\"i == ct\"\n", "Q: How to share internet access between Ubuntu and Windows guests OS in VirtualBox? Using VirtualBox.\nThere's two Virtual Machines, Ubuntu 10.04 and Windows 7.\nOn Ubuntu:\nThere's two ethernet interfaces.\n\n\n*\n\n*Bridge interface (eth0) who can access the internet. ping www.google.com works ok.\n\n*NAT interface (eth1) configured as Internal Network who have ip 10.0.0.101, netmask 255.255.255.0 and gateway 10.0.0.1 who can ping Windows 7 in 10.0.0.102.\n\n\nOn Windows\n\n\n*\n\n*A interface who have ip 10.0.0.102 and can ping Linux in 10.0.0.101 ok, but can't ping www.google.com.\n\n\nSo, how can I configure Windows to have access to the internet using my Linux machine?\n\nA: Ok it works like this, when you are INSIDE the virtual environment just forget about virtualbox. Assumming you have the following setup, it should all work out:\nMAIN HOST (The one where you are running virtualbox with both guess insides) - It should have an internet access. Does not matter if it through a proxy, inside an intranet or a normal connection to your ISP. It should have access to the internet.\nVIRTUALBOX - VIRTUAL HOST (UBUNTU) - It should have one network connection to your MAIN HOST which provides internet and one network connection (Called by default Internal Network) which we will use to share the connection. It should be noted that after finishing the whole sharing explanation this can also work if the HOST is Windows.\nVIRTUALBOX - VIRTUAL GUEST (WINDOWS) - It should have one network connection to the \"Internal Network\".\nWith all of this setup in that specific way you can do the following:\nVIRTUAL HOST (Ubuntu) \n\n\n*\n\n*In your Ubuntu 10.04 go to Connection Indicator in the Panel (Network Manager Applet)\n\n*Go to Edit Connections.  \n\n*Select your INTERNAL NETWORK interface (Since you will see 2, example eth0 and eth1. One of them is the internal one that connects to the rest of the virtual guests and the other one connects to your MAIN HOST) and open it.  \n\n*Go to IPv4 Settings and in the Method field select \"Shared with Other Computers\".  \n\n*Apply and you are done with the VIRTUAL HOST (Ubuntu). Now for the VIRTUAL GUEST (Windows).  \n\n\nNOTE - Some people might suggest a little more complicated iptables, masquerade console commands. There is no need for this since (I think) Ubuntu 9.04 or higher. Since the Network Manager updated itself several years ago everything from Modem, Cellphones and shared wifi connections has been easier than ever.\nVIRTUAL GUEST (Windows)\nGo to the \"Network Manager\" in Windows and select the only connection you have. Go to the Ipv4 TCP Protocol and verify that it has the IP set to Dynamic/Auto. It should now see the connection from the ubuntu box. IF by any case it does not work, since you have Windows 7 which includes a pretty nifty way of checking for internet acces you should run this tool from the network manager in windows and make it look for the internet. in this same manner I have made around 50 setups for windows xp, windows vista and windows 7. Most of which are for windows 7. So I might be going out of a limb here but for 50 tests am pretty sure this will work ^^.\nNOTE - There is actually no need for a DHCP Server like in Ubuntu server to share. There is also no need for a DNS server in windows. The default setup that comes in ubuntu and windows can deal with a simple task like this. The thing to remember here is that, when inside the virtual environment just forget about the host. Imagine yourself in a lan party with 2 PCs which one has an internet connection and another connection to the lan and the other PC wants to have internet shared to. Eliminating the association between the virtual place and the real place (MAIN HOST) helps in solving several network problems.\nNOTE 2 - Additional you NEED (Let me rephrase that, YOU REALLY REALLY!!! NEED) to use the version from VirtualBox and the Extension of Virtualbox to have everything working as it should. The latest version up to this moment which is the 4.1.4 version which came on October 3rd has many problems solved and since version 4.1.2 I can vouch that the horrible problems about random mouse movement and sharing virtual folders is gone.\nThe latest version can be found here: https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Linux_Downloads\nAnd the extension for the latest here: https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads\nWhy am I making such a big fuss over using the Virtualbox from the site and not a PPA or the OSE version. Because first Virtualbox will add after installing the package (Just double click it after downloading it) the ppa or repo to get the latest updates. Second the OSE has many less features than the one in the webpage (This difference started from when innotek was the main company and in those days OSE and virtualbox normal were the same). Now the virtualbox from the main page has way too many more things. Also many PPA out there are obsolete or not updated so fast as the main repo from virtualbox.\nNOTE 3 - Since Virtualbox 4.1.4 there is no need to download the extension again. Virtualbox will automatically check to see if the extension is compatible or up to date with the latest version installed. But you still need to install it if you haven't yet done so. At least the first time. After that there is no more need to do it.\n", "Q: Why does flashplugin-installer display a multi-line terminal progress when downloading? I have this issue from MANY Ubuntu releases.\nwhy when I wget a file it takes just one row and give me all information (like time, total space, bit downloaded, percent)\nWhen downloading flashplugin via flashplugin installer, the installer in a terminal displayed many rows - why?\n\n\nA: That's by design of the installer. These commands are executed by the flashplugin installer post-installation script:\n# setting wget options\n:> wgetrc\necho \"noclobber = off\" >> wgetrc\necho \"dir_prefix = .\" >> wgetrc\necho \"dirstruct = off\" >> wgetrc\necho \"verbose = on\" >> wgetrc\necho \"progress = dot:default\" >> wgetrc\n\n# downloading the plugin\necho \"Downloading...\"\nrm -f $FILENAME\necho \"Getting ${ADOBE_URL}\"\nWGETRC=wgetrc wget ${ADOBE_URL} \\\n|| fp_exit_with_error \"download failed\"\nrm -f wgetrc\necho \"Download done.\"\n\nThe relevant setting is progress = dot:default which cannot be overriden.

I am drawing a state transition diagram using LibreOffice draw on Ubuntu 11.04. I am able to get almost everything that I needed except the final state. Typically we use two circles embedded in for showing a final state of a state transition diagram. Could someone help me to do that? Please also let me know if there are any better tools for drawing state transition diagrams on Ubuntu. I have looked at Dia, but it is not also useful to draw final state of a state transition diagram like in this.\n\nA: Actually Dia does allow you to add an end state. Select the UML shapes, then drag the \"initial/end state\" shape onto your diagram. When you double click the shape, you'll see a button that says \"Is final\". This lets you define whether the state is initial or final.\nEDIT: If you don't like how those look, it's pretty easy to create your own shapes in Dia. They're just SVG files.\nSave the following as ~/.dia/shapes/fsm_final_state.shape :\n<?xml version=\"1.0\"?>\n\n<shape xmlns=\"http://www.daa.com.au/~james/dia-shape-ns\"\n       xmlns:svg=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\">\n  <name>Finite State Machine - Final State</name>\n  <icon>fsm_final_state_icon.xpm</icon>\n  <connections>\n    <point x=\"0.0\" y=\"2.5\" />\n    <point x=\"2.5\" y=\"5.0\" />\n    <point x=\"5.0\" y=\"2.5\" />\n    <point x=\"2.5\" y=\"0.0\" />\n  </connections>\n  <textbox x1=\"0.0\" y1=\"0.0\" x2=\"5.0\" y2=\"5.0\" />\n  <svg:svg width=\"5.0\" height=\"5.0\">\n    <svg:circle style=\"fill: default;\" cx=\"2.5\" cy=\"2.5\" r=\"2.5\" />\n  </svg:svg>\n  <svg:svg width=\"4.0\" height=\"4.0\">\n    <svg:circle style=\"fill: default;\" cx=\"2.5\" cy=\"2.5\" r=\"2.0\" />\n  </svg:svg>\n</shape>\n\nSave the following as ~/.dia/shapes/fsm_final_state_icon.xpm :\n/* XPM */\nstatic char * fsm_final_state_icon_xpm[] = {\n\"16 16 14 1\",\n\"   c None\",\n\".  c #FFFFFF\",\n\"+  c #FCFCFC\",\n\"@  c #B6B6B6\",\n\"#  c #545454\",\n\"$  c #000000\",\n\"%  c #101010\",\n\"&  c #D8D8D8\",\n\"*  c #121212\",\n\"=  c #353535\",\n\"-  c #A0A0A0\",\n\";  c #EBEBEB\",\n\">  c #040404\",\n\",  c #9E9E9E\",\n\"................\",\n\"....+@#$%#@+....\",\n\"...&*=-.;-=*&...\",\n\"..&>,......,>&..\",\n\".+*,........,*+.\",\n\".@=..........=@.\",\n\".#-..........-#.\",\n\".%;..........;%.\",\n\".%;..........;%.\",\n\".#-..........-#.\",\n\".@=..........=@.\",\n\".+*,........,*+.\",\n\"..&>,......,>&..\",\n\"...&*=-.;-=*&...\",\n\"....+@#$%#@+....\",\n\"................\"};\n\nFinally, save the following as ~/.dia/sheets/Finite_State_Machine.sheet :\n<?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"UTF-8\" standalone=\"no\"?>\n<sheet xmlns=\"http://www.lysator.liu.se/~alla/dia/dia-sheet-ns\">\n<!--File: ~/.dia/sheets/Finite_State_Machine.sheet-->\n\n<name>Finite State Machine</name>\n<description>Finite state machine diagrams</description>\n<contents>\n<!--add shapes here-->\n<object name=\"Finite State Machine - Final State\">\n<description>Final</description></object>\n\n</contents></sheet>\n\nWhen you restart Dia you should have a \"Finite State Machine\" sheet with one shape: a decent looking final state!\n\nA: I suggest you to use inkscape  to produce graphics like that, it takes a little time to learn how to use the tools but it is well rewarded with the graphic quality of the product.\n\nA: I suggest you to use Dia software for your state diagram or any other UML or flow diagrams.

I want to remove Spotify version 0.61 because it crashes on start up. But when I hit the \"remove/modify\" button it deselects my selection (spotify) and chooses the program above it (Counter-strike 1.6). I have tried to remove counter strike, BUT it gives me an error with a missing file. \nSo I'm stuck and I have no idea how to move on please help me.\nThe normal way to remove wine software doesn't work as I have said. This is how-to:\nWine --> uninstall wine software --> select program --> remove/modify button. \nwine's uninstall program can't open the \"uninstall.ini\" file (counter strike 1.6)\n\nA: Wine is still not very good at removing programs, so your options may be rather slim. This is actually a problem inherited from the way Windows manages installed applications, so it won't change any time soon either.\nYou could manually remove the program's files from your virtual \"C:\\\" Drive, then open the uninstall center and remove that application from the list. However, it is possible that the program will leave some cruft behind.\nMy best suggestion is that you use something like PlayOnLinux or WBM (Wine Bottle Manager) to manage your WINE applications. Even if there is not a script in PlayOnLinux for your application, you can still install it to a separate WINE prefix, and make uninstalls easier.\nIf you don't have too much to lose, you can go right ahead and remove your ~/.wine folder (run rm -r ~/.wine) (backup first just in case), then reinstall the applications you need. Chances are, it may even fix your Spotify problems.\n\nA: Open Terminal:\ncd ~/.wine\n\nthen\ncd /dosdevices/c:Games/\n\nand remove files:\nsudo rm -R Counter-Strike/\n\n", "Q: Windows machine does not sync it's folders Natty uploads files instantly, but the Win7 box does not sync it's folders, it does not down or up-load anything.

After the installation is complete, the new application switcher is gone.  In its place is a ugly grey Windows XP-ish thing.\nI am not sure if this is a graphics driver issue, because I enabled nvidia proprietary driver.  But other 3D related things looks fine.  So how can I get the new application switcher back?\n\n\nA: It looks like if you are using Ubuntu 2D. When logging in, select \"Ubuntu\", instead of \"Ubuntu 2D\".\n\nA: Hansioux,\nThis is very likely a driver issue.  I had a somewhat similar problem when I installed the NVIDIA drivers from the NVIDIA website in 11.04.  Replacing those with the drivers in the nvidia-current package fixed it.\nIn my case, I dropped to the console (CTRL + ALT + F1), stopped gdm and then re-ran the NVIDIA install script as root, but with the \"--uninstall\" parameter.  After it finished removing that version of the driver, I installed nvidia-current and then rebooted.  The eye candy is back (switcher, aero-ish snap, etc.).  FYI: I use Gnome 2.3, but I don't think the problem was at that level.\nSo, in my case:\n(from console)\n$ sudo su -\n# stop gdm\n# sh /home/tim/Downloads/NVIDIA-Linux-x86-285.05.09.run --uninstall\n# apt-get install nvidia-current\n# reboot\n\n\nA: Same thing here, updating from 11.04 to 11.10 in an Optimus laptop (Asus N53).

I am going to need to do some statistical analysis soon. Looking for significant difference. I am a bit of a dunce in this area but I will have help. Can you suggest which software would be most appropriate - in the past I have used SPSS. All suggestions will be welcome - thank you.\n\nA: Look into R or JGR. Both are open source alternatives to SPSS\nR- http://www.r-project.org/\nJGR- http://rforge.net/JGR/ (GUI for R)\n\nA: Libre Office - Calc is one of the simpler options.  Calc provides a spreadsheet and it is essentially a replacement for Microsoft Excel.  It also provides a suite of statistical functions that once again depending on the sophistication you need could provide everything you need to perform an analysis. The list of statistical functions is quite extensive and you can check that out to see if it would contain what you need.\n\nPSPP has the goal of being an SPSS replacement.  If all you're looking to do is some simple analysis this will probably be good enough for you.  It doesn't completely replicate all of the features of SPSS but it is open source and is free to use.  Since you already have SPSS experience this would probably be the best program for you to go with.  I prefer R and I think it is much more powerful but it doesn't sound like you're going to be doing anything requiring too much sophistication and R does has a bigger learning curve to go along with it.\n\nR is a great choice but it does have a significant learning curve.  If you're not comfortable programming some code yourself it would take a while to get used to.  With that said it is very powerful and there are a couple of tools that try to help make the experience easier.\nRkward is a decent tool and that provides a GUI for R and some menu driven options to conduct your analysis (with the plus side of giving you the code used to actually conduct the analysis).\nRstudio is a nice IDE for R that provides some nice features.  It won't help you learn R but it will make using R quite a bit nicer.\nThere are other tools such as Rcmdr, JGR, Emacs+ESS, Eclipse+StatET for making using R either easier by providing a nice editor for writing your scripts or by providing a nice GUI interface.\nIf you want to go with R then initially you'll probably want to give something like Rkward a try and maybe eventually move to Rstudio.  If you think R is a route you might take you can leave a comment and I can definitely add to this section.  I use R all the time and it's my preferred tool for an analysis.\n\nTo summarize:   \n\n\n*\n\n*R is very powerful and I can guarantee that it will be able to do what you need to do for a statistical analysis but it has a learning curve though and if you don't feel comfortable programming it probably isn't the tool for you.  \n\n*PSPP is an SPSS replacement and since you have prior experience it does seem to be a natural fit for your goals.  \n\n*Libre Office - Calc is probably simplest tool here but depending on the sophistication you need it will most likely get the job done and you won't even have to leave a spreadsheet environment.\n\nA: If you are after something like SPSS in particular, you could try GNU PSPP, which is packaged in Ubuntu. It strives to remain compatible with the SPSS\ncommand language and data formats, but does not support all SPSS\ncommands.\nI am typing on a iphone so I can't give you the direct link. Just google it. The interface should be easy to navigate as it is to me the open source version of SPSS. \nLINK: http://www.gnu.org/software/pspp/\n\nA: Try this link   http://www.sofastatistics.com/downloads.php\nI already installed it on my Ubuntu 12.04 and its amazing.\n", "Q: How do I always show the launcher (i.e. disable the auto-hide functionality)? When I upgraded from 11.04 to 11.10, the setting remained. Now that I have done a clean install of 11.10, the CCSM option does NOT work anymore and I can't seem to find a solution.

It does not take effect the first time you change it. Only after rebooting will it work. At least for me.\n\nNOTE - Stopping the Auto-Hide will save some trouble with some windows like the Back Button of Firefox been underneath the Launcher when it \"auto-appears\". It is VERY IMPORTANT you update the system (Check for updates with the Update Manager and apply all of them). Reboot and then do this answer. This way you save yourself some other troubles that have been fixed already with this minor updates.\nAs you can see in all the images the Launcher stays there in a fixed position. Saving me some seconds each time I need to search for something.\nNOTE2 - Using unity --reset will only reset you to the default config it has after installing 11.10.

After reading through one of the bug reports linked to above, and then following one of the links in there, I found this question: Geforce Go 7300/7400 Blacklisted, Can I Still Run Unity?\nIt turns out that the video card (in my case a nVidia 7300) was blacklisted, and even though I was logging into \"Unity\" and not \"Unity 2D\", it was still falling back to 2D mode because the card is blacklisted.\nThere is a workaround there about installing the nVidia 173 drivers and forcing Unity mode, and it works for me. I also tried it with the latest drivers, hoping the compatibility issues has been fixed, but the system locked up as soon as I logged in, so I had to go back to the nVidia 173 drivers.\nThe important parts from the link I posted:\nRun /usr/lib/nux/unity_support_test -p.

Once you install the nVidia 173 driver, you can edit /etc/environment and add the following line:\nUNITY_FORCE_START=1\n\nLog out and back in, and you should be set.

But I want to install python 2.6, how am I about to do that? Thanks.\n\nA: You can install python 2.6 by running this command clicking this link: python2.6\nOr by typing this command in a terminal.\nsudo apt-get install python2.6\n\n\nA: Get pythonbrew. This should let you run 2.6 and 2.7 side by side. \npythonbrew install 2.6\npythonbrew switch 2.6\n\n\nA: Just to list all the options: just pulling down a source tarball from python.org, unpacking it and compiling your own python interpreter is also easy and is actually what real men do :) You can install it in a separate directory so it doesn't interfere with the system python. Messing with system python is dangerous because lots of Ubuntu programs use it. So something like this:\nsudo apt-get install build-essential\nwget http://www.python.org/ftp/python/2.6.7/Python-2.6.7.tar.bz2\ntar jxf ./Python-2.6.7.tar.bz2\ncd ./Python-2.6.7\n./configure --prefix=~/mypython && make && make install\n\nwould build you your own Python which you'll be able to invoke as\n./mypython/bin/python2.6\n\nSupposedly, pythonbrew (mentioned in the other answer) may automate the process a bit, but it's really not that complex\n", "Q: How to play music from iTunes library located in a Windows 7 partition?

Like no-install-recommends? I am using 11.04 which I started off with a Command Line System via Alternate CD then installed apps on top. When I upgrade to 11.10 soon, isit possible to upgrade just the OS, probably with the core files (Unity etc) but without the extra apps (Office etc, unless I have them installed already) \nOr do I need to installed from scratch from a 11.10 Alternate CD again?\n\nA: The official way to upgrade Ubuntu from the command-line is intended to work the way you want: it should only upgrade the packages you've already got on the system.\nIf it does install new packages, it is because some upgraded packages have new dependencies. This applies especially to the package ubuntu-desktop, which will depend on all the new default applications. I doubt you have ubuntu-desktop installed though, as you installed the server edition.\n\nA: It is possible, though more complicated. Interestingly thought his method can be safer if you know what you are doing (I trust you know what you are doing?).\nIf you have Synaptic installed (I suggest you use Synaptic for this process):\n\n\n*\n\n*open Synaptic\n\n*then open software sources, and change all entries from natty to oneiric, then reload your sources.\n\n*Manually upgrade your packages (either bit by bit, or all at once, though I suggest bit by bit).\n\n*When you are done you will be running 11.10, should all go smoothly.\n\n", "Q: Network manager forgets wireless password after sleeping or powering off Every time I restore my computer from sleep or turn it on a window pops up asking for my wireless password. Once I enter it it connects successfully, but this happens every time. I'm using Ubuntu 11.10 with all updates installed. Shouldn't the password be remembered so you don't have to enter it every time I get on? \nAnyone know why this is happening and how to fix it? \n\nA: I had the same problem. To fix this. Go to your network connections. From there click on wireless tab. Choose your connection and then click the edit button. Make sure your password is entered then click on the wireless security tab. Then check the box in the bottom left corner that says available to all users. This is what fixed the problem for me.\n\nA: Here is a slight variation of Hugo's answer. For me the problem was occuring with a particular network despite the \"All users may connect to this network\" checkbox being already checked. So what I did was to uncheck the box, save, check the box, then save again. I know this seems retarded, but it solved the problem for me.\n\nA: If you got the edit connections tab and look in wireless security. Is your password there. if not enter it and it should stay there. \n\nA: Are you using an automatic login or du you need to type your password into lightdm when you start your computer? In a previous ubuntu version I had a similar issue and removing the automatic login did the trick. This is/was some strange security policy and I don't know if this solution will work for Ubuntu 11.10 / Gnome 3 but maybe this still works.\n\nA: The real issue for me was weak signal, I attached an external antenna to fix that.\nThis is a bug and no workaround worked for me.\nIt seems to be related to the gnome keyring, but I could not figure out why it pops up while the box is filled in (i.e. password is saved).\n\nA: I don't know how to fix that behavior but I do know an alternative method of security that's not as strong as the password but will still keep the many unwanted users off your network and not query you on every boot up. Set up MAC address blocking in your router and disable the password. Open up your browser and connect to the router. Frequently http://192.168.1.1, a router password will also be required. You'll then be able to look through the router's menu tree to find where it configures MAC address blocking. It's a good idea to set your router password to something other than the default. On my TRENDnet router the default password was \"admin.\" You can find the correct IP and default password in the documentation that came with your router. If you can't find it you can download a new manual from the manufacturer.\n\nA: It's probably related to this bug\nI have a variant of the bug, in which it created multiple prompts, but after a while managed to connect... turns out that in my case the issue was due to some duplicate connection configs of the same wifi\n", "Q: encrypted /home won't decrypt after upgrade to 11.10 I did a clean install of beta 2 10.11 and pointed the install to my /home which is on a separate partition.

If I use sudo ecryptfs-recover-private it will mount the old /home to a /tmp folder and I can see the contents. How do I fix this so that my /home decrypts normally when I log in? Thanks.\n\nA: I would just try copying the relevant data from your old /home partition across. There are probably other ways, but this is likely the easiest. Good luck.\n", "Q: Will applications in the software center receive updates of new versions? Is it possible to provide updates for software in Ubuntu 11.10 software center.\nFor example upcoming versions of vlc, inkscape and many others.   \n\nA: New versions of applications can be provided after they have made it into the development release by backports. This repository is enabled by default in 11.10, but it is not an automatic update for packages that you have installed.\nBackports are built & tested mainly by volunteers, and there are some limitations on what updates can be provided, depending on how many other packages depend on them.\n\nA: I know that Firefox will have version updates, like it has now in 11.04, but other software won't. Only bugfixes will be provided.\nYou need to install other ppas like now.\n\nA: The GetDeb project provides new updates for open source and freeware applications. This is an easy way to get new sofware into Ubuntu. GetDeb.net\nBut software updates should be a core feature of the Ubuntu software center. A small notification could show you if updates are available and ask you to install. It would be nice if someone could mention this on the right place for development.\n", "Q: How can I change the keyboard layout in the login screen? I have different users on the machine who use different keyboard layouts.  In 11.04, you could change the keyboard layout on the login screen (and it would remember it per user).\nHow can I do this in 11.10?  Or is it not possible? \n\nA: Ubuntu 11.10 uses a new log-in manager called LightDM. The \"Simple LightDM Manager\" program allows you to change settings for LightDM, but it only supports changes to the background image and logo right now. \nUnfortunately, you may need to make these keyboard changes individually within each user account. To do so:\n\n\n*\n\n*Log into your Ubuntu account. \n\n*Right-click your username in the upper-right corner of the top toolbar on your screen. \n\n*Look for and right-click \"System Settings\". If it isn't on the menu, right-click directly to the right of your username on the toolbar. \"System Settings\" should be listed at the top of this menu. \n\n*Select \"Keyboard\" in the window. \n\n*Select \"Layout Settings\" in the lower-left corner of the next window. \n\n*Choose your settings. Click \"Options\" in the lower-right corner to further customize your keyboard settings. If you'd like, you can choose to program individual key combinations to automatically change the keyboard layout/settings for you. \n\n\nIf your keyboard layout change isn't working properly, you may need to use the command-line to fix it. This link may be helpful:\nhttp://igrudge.net/keyboard-layout-ubuntu-server-11-04/\nTo download Simple LightDM Manager or get more information about it, visit:\nhttp://www.freedesktop.org/wiki/Software/LightDM\n\nA: Had the same problem. Found many non-working solutions. But finally I found a workaround which indeed worked:\n\n\n*\n\n*Edit the file /etc/gdm/Init/Default.\n\n*Scroll down to the end of the file and add the command setxkbmap de before the last line of the file (So it is above the exit call). Use a different layout instead of de if needed.\n\n*Restart GDM.\n\n\nThis is for GDM only. Maybe LightDM has a similar file where this line can be added. Don't know.\n", "Q: How do I install Ubuntu on a VirtualBox client from an ISO image? I have the ISO image file (that is, *.iso) and I am trying to boot my VirtualBox installation with this image.

I have installed Gnome3 from gnome.org website, following the install link for Ubuntu. So I think everything should be fine.\nBut the lg command is missing and I am not able to find any package providing it. Any hint?\n\nA: To my knowledge, the command \"looking glass\" is a part of the GNOME-Shell itself.\nMake sure you have \"gnome compatibility\" activated in the Compiz config settings manager, and you have GNOME-Shell installed.\nThe \"running command\" shortcut normally is Alt + F2.\nSo, please press Alt + F2, a very simple command window will appear.

I noticed that when using the Backup option, when restoring from 1 machine to another, my resolution wasn't optimal ... Idealy, I will also like user/passwords to be different ... I believe there are other things that might need to be changed manually like driver config etc? \nWhat do I need to consider and do to fix them when restoring a backup from 1 machine to another (with different hardware)?\nWould using the TAR method have a similar problem with different hardware? Like GPU's or even CPU being different, like backup from desktop restored to laptop? Main Purpose: Sync Apps \n\nA: If your main purpose is syncing apps, then just move your home dir and export/import the list of installed packages.\noldmachine$ dpkg --get-selections > list-of-installed-packages\n\nnewmachine$ dpkg --set-selections < list-of-installed-packages && apt-get -u dselect-upgrade\n\n\nA: Unfortunately making a backup to restore to another system with different hardware will always leave you with a half stable / configured system.\nThe possibilities and variations of hardware and what needs to be configured are huge. The fact that you were able to boot on that backup you restored to another system and only complaint about the graphics configuration is not normal.\nFull backups, 1:1 copies or system images are to be restored to the same hardware configuration.\nTar backups wont help you, the chances of anything going wrong if restored to a different hardware will be greater (from what I understood RemasterSys does try to make your system bootable on a different hardware).\nWord of advice is, make backups of what is personal. Full system restores work perfect only on the same hardware.\nIf you want to sync apps between systems and both systems have the same applications installed (same versions would help) a backup of you home will contain most of the configuration you need to restore, a script can be made that gets the packages from one machine to the other but seriously you know what you use daily, a script reads all the packages from one installation to another would really be a overkill since you would have to sort out the packages that you don't want installed on the other computers (ie: hardware drivers).\nIf you want to transport packages from one computer to another and be able to easy select what to install use APTonCD for that.\nOther then this will need some more (maybe a bit!) of configuration and trouble shoot.\n\nA: You can do this easily by a tool called Aptoncd . You can select the packages you want and best of all you can put it in a portable apt repo,requiring no internet\n\nA: I consider backup/restore of the main OS pretty much a waste of time, as you will always carry over a whole bunch of old cruft that might cause obscure trouble at time or another, especially if you carry your OS with you for a number of years. So I would always go with a clean system install on a new machine and then go from there, unless you have to handle dozens of machines of course.\nAs for installing the same applications on both machines, you can do that with a little bit of scripting:\ndpkg -l | gawk  \"/^ii/ { print \\$2 }\" > installed_packages\n\nAnd then on the other machine:\napt-get install $(cat installed_packages)\n\n\nA: If you want to do this just for applications what Grumbel suggested should work.  Another way to do it would be simply Making a pseudo-package that requires all the packages currently installed on one box with a >= version.  Then you install like normal and add a single package and it pulls in everything.  \nNote that neither Grumbel's approach nor mine handle configuration files.\n", "Q: Creating your own distro/backup (or Alternatives to RemasterSys) \nPossible Duplicate:\nHow to customize live Ubuntu CD?\nWhat are the alternative softwares of remastersys? \n\nI usually use RemasterSys to create a Backup/Distro of my current system with apps intact.

I only know C and Java. And I really don't want to learn another language when I can work with what I already know. I haven't ever written a GTK+ application, but I am planning to start with an experimental project. So, are there any advantages of writing in Python over Java (with respect to GTK+)?\n\nA: I'm not 100% sure about this (only 99% :P) but I think it's because Python is preinstalled on Ubuntu while Java is not. Also Python integrates GTK+ really well (http://www.pygtk.org/). At least that's the reason why I prefer Python over Java although I can't say something about Java integration. And I like Python's syntax, documentation and community more.\nBut as sagarchalise already said, why don't you use C if you know it? You can create your GUIs with Glade and use it in C and Python and maybe other languages.\nBesides: \"I really don't want to learn another language when I can work with what I already know.\" is a rather ... suboptimal ... attitude. You should always try to expand your horizons and look how others do things. Python is a object-oriented imperative language too and as I always say: if you know one you know them all. Sure there are some things that differ but \"learning\" Python is easy peasy if you know Java. I'd say give it a try.\n\nA: Python is a much more expressive language than Java. I used to be a very enthusiastic Java developer, but after I started using Python, I'll never go back. Python is quite simply a wonderful language for all kinds of different tasks. \nI haven't actually programmed much GTK with Java, but there is at least some support for GObject Introspection, which will make many libraries available even if you use Java. Also, interfaces made in Glade will be usable from Java. Using Python is mostly a matter of comfort and not necessity. \n\nA: I'm learning Python, as my first programming language (other than pascal in high school) I have tried learning C++ about 10 years ago and failed, never did anything with it, and I have a bunch of books on Java that I did'nt buy.  And I am glad that Python is popular because it sure is a lot simpler to use than what I remember from my earlier programming days.\nI don't know much about Python but if you know other languages you'll pick up Python quickly I guarantee it \n\nA: But Canonical accepts in their repos apps made with Java, look at this:\nClic at: Programming Languajes\n\nA: People choose different languages for different reasons, an important one being their familiarity with the particular language.\nAs for creating Gtk applications, if you know Java, you might consider Vala. It is a lot like Java but very well integrated into the Gnome/Gtk environment.\n", "Q: How can I add my application to the Ubuntu repository? \nPossible Duplicate:\nHow do I put a package into the Ubuntu repositories? \n\nI've just made a project called tgames and want to add it at the ubuntu repository...\n(multiverse or universe or anything)\nCan I do this or should I create a ppa???\n\nA: The process for getting new packages into archive is outlined here:\n\n\n*\n\n*https://wiki.ubuntu.com/UbuntuDevelopment/NewPackages\n\nA: You will need to create a ppa via your launchpad account, activate it on your profile page, sign the Ubuntu Cod of Conduct, then start uploading your source package. \nFor more in-depth detail: \nhttps://help.launchpad.net/Packaging/PPA\nThere are hyperlinks embedded in the instructions that will link on how to access your profile page, signing the code of conduct, & upload your source code. \n", "Q: kpackagekit hangs I just installed kubuntu 11.04 and the problem I have is that kpackagekit \"froze\" while installing updates. It froze while installing some plasma widgets.\nSo my question is how can I disable the updating process without breaking the system and what is the most recommended way to install updates on kubuntu (I have realized that kpackagekit is really buggy)?\n\nA: i also had issue with kpackagekit which forced me to install synaptic, this wasn't ideal but worked well until i found muon.\nit is very similar to synaptic but coded in Qt and it is set to replace kpackagekit for Oneric\nMore info here\n\nA: I restarted the computer and ran sudo apt-get update and then after a few steps the problem is fixed.\nFrom what I read the better way to maintain the system is through the terminal and not kpackagekit.\n", "Q: Rhythmbox (or any music player) doesn't change songs properties I have some songs in my Rhythmbox, but I cannot change their properties, i.e., I cannot write anything in the properties window. It seems to be block or something like that.\nI thought that such files are read-only or protected but I change such properties with sudo and nothing changed. \nAny idea?\n\nA: I had the same problem and noticed after a while that I was trying to change a .wma file. So instead of switching to another player (I really like rhythmbox) I used the sound converter (via software center) to convert it to .mp3. Close and start rhythmbox and now I could edit the id3 tags.\n\nA: The artist name, album title and other information that you are trying to change are called ID3 tags. You can search the Ubuntu Software Center for id3tag editors and pick whatever you like/prefer and use that to change the information. Most players have that functionality inbuilt, not sure about Rhythmbox(coz I have never used it), but I use Clementine and it allows me to change the ID3 tags as required.\n\nA: I think you can try easytag. You can install it by running sudo apt-get install easytag.\n\nA: Or you can download Banshee, that changes the song's ID3 tags.\n\nA: Try using\nsudo chmod -R 777 /*YourMusicDirectory*/\n\nFor exmaple, if your music is in /home/USER/Music; it is like:\nsudo chmod -R 777 /home/USER/Music\n\nIn USER, put your user name.\nI am not a english native speaker, sorry if I made mistakes.\n", "Q: How (and where) can one change 'user@host $:' pattern in gnome-terminal?

Install PPA, Update, install packages, done.\nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:gloobus-dev/gloobus-preview\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get install gloobus-preview gloobus-sushi\n\nGloobus is an alternative to Sushi (Which I find much better since it supports a couple of friendly options) and you can preview Avi files, MKV files, Video files in general, sound files in general, text, pdf, etc... Just press space and PREVIEW. Press space again and preview off. Also you can start previwing a file and use your keyboard arrows to move to another file for preview.\nIf you are using 13.04+ the following is the install command line:\nsudo apt-get install gloobus-preview\n\n", "Q: Is it there any advantage to unticking the \"Source Code\" entry of a repository? \nAbove is a screenshot showing an enabled PPA from the ayatana-scrollbar-team. There are two entries, one with a \"(Source Code)\" label and one without.\nIf installing ubuntu on a computer where the user is not very knowledgeable about computers, is there any advantage in unticking the \"(Source Code)\" entry?

Does it have a purpose on machines used by people who don't even know how to read source code? I'd like to know if I should just keep it enabled or whether I would lose/gain anything by disabling it.  \n\nA: The advantage it exactly what you said, a shorter update time, and the impossibility to download source packages through\napt-get source package-name\n\nMost users do not download and use source packages anyway.

By \"perfectly\" I mean:\n\n\n*\n\n*No proprietary driver install (works out of the box)\n\n*Full featured driver: duplex printing (if supported by the printer), adjustable printing quality, printer maintenance routines, etc...\n\n\nAnd it has to be cheap, because I'll use it just to occasionally print a bunch of text documents, at low quality, and printing on both sides.\n\nA: I would recommend a Samsung ML-2851ND. It works under many - perhaps all - Linux Distributions out of the box without the need to install any additional software. It's a small printer for the SOHO market, so that the toner is quite expensive (compared to big office printers), but compared to similar printers from HP or Brother, it's quite cheap.\nThe printer has Ethernet, so that you can print from any computer inside your LAN. It has a Duplexer, so that you can print on both sides of a page. And it is a compact printer, so that it doesn't clutter your room. \nI'm using the printer with Ubuntu 10.10, 11.04 and 11.10 without problems. It is automatically detected by the printing utility. If you like to read more, you might visit my blog, unfortunately it's written in German, perhaps the Google Translater is goo enough for you.\nChristoph\n\nA: I finally bought an HP LaserJet P1102 for two reasons:\n\n\n*\n\n*It seems HP supports Linux outstandingly, and I can confirm it does\n\n*The printer is damn cheap: got it for 69€.\n\n\nA: I can also confirm that HP printers perform outstandingly in Ubuntu. I have HP LaserJet 1018 and it works fantastic! It was relatively cheap, works right out of the box, prints perfectly ... I couldn't be happier. I also use it to print from VirtualBox and that also works without any problems.\nI think any HP printer which is at least a year old model should work right out of the box in Ubuntu.\n\nA: Oki 431 gets very good reviews for the price point...and I just got one today.  Unfortunately I haven't been able to get it set up properly in Ubuntu 12.04 PP, which is why I'm surfing the \"printing\" tags this evening...if I get it to work I'll try to remember to report back with an update.\n", "Q: What is the difference between shutdown and poweroff commands? I've a home server I'm playing around with :) I want to learn server administration...\nI have a hard time understanding the difference between shutdown -h now and poweroff -h now\nMy logic tells me it's the same thing...\nBut with the shutdown, Linux halts, and power stays on - I can see all lights up and cooler rotating. Strange, the only way to turn off my box completely is to use poweroff -h\nAny clarification will be appreciated!\n\nA: The answer is in the poweroff(8) man page:\n\nWhen  called  with  --force  or when in runlevel 0 or 6, this tool invokes the reboot(2) system\n  call itself and directly reboots the system.  Otherwise this  simply  invokes  the  shutdown(8)\n  tool with the appropriate arguments.\n\nA bit of explanation:\n\n\n*\n\n*The reboot() system call\nis the kernel function used to reboot, halt or poweroff the\nmachine. It is called reboot for historical reasons, but performs\nall three functions, depending on parameters that are passed to it.\n\n*The difference between halt and poweroff is that in halt mode\nthe control is returned to a \"ROM monitor\" (think BIOS), whereas\npoweroff simply powers the system board off. (I have never seen\nthis distinction in effect on PC architectures; on Sun machines it's\ndifferent, though.)\n\n*So, when the poweroff program is invoked when the Linux system is\nin runlevel 0 or 6, it will immediately power off the system via the\nreboot(RB_POWEROFF) system call.\n\n*In any other case, poweroff will just behave as an alias for\nshutdown now. \n", "Q: /var/log/apache2 gets deleted on restart - so apache doesn't start on startup I need help.\nEvery time I restart apache log directory gets deleted.

UG      100     0     0      wlan0\nI am not using firewall. Using dhcp. No wireless security.\nHow do I fix this?\nThanks.\n\nA: That is actually not a problem in Ubuntu, but a problem with the configuration in the cafe. Not all cafes offer free, one click away internet connection. Cafes and Airports for example offer a website to which you connect (Tipically a 192.168.1.1, 10.0.0.1 or similar IPs) and in the web page the charge you with some credit point or credit card the time or bandwidth you will be using. This is one case.\nOther cases include a proxy setting that you need to do or some static ip that you need to configure.\nIn any or all cases you need to ask in the place where you want to connect. Either to the person attending the cafe or if in an airport to somebody in charge.\nMentioning that the wireless connection works in your home just shows that the wireless device in your laptop is working correctly. So the problem must be somewhere else and not in Ubuntu.\n\nA: Is your system on Mains Power or Battery when you have the problem or not? I've found that /usr/sbin/pm-powersave turns OFF my wireless card when I switch to battery. So far. I've gotten wireless to stay up by executing sudo /usr/sbin/pm-powersave false. The man pm-powersave page says I can create an empty file /etc/pm/power.d/wireless to prevent /usr/lib/pm-utils/power.d/wireless from running and doing its magic. \n\nA: Never found out the answer.\nEnded up removing network manager and using Wicd. Overall Wicd is better, but now I can't connect to iPhone or a different cafe.\n\nA: Some Cafes reroute you to a \"captive\" portal where at the very least, you may have to agree to a \"terms and conditions\" policy.  To get  the portal to appear your may have to search  a fresh URL or hit \"home\", or clear your cache, so the Access point  can intercept /redirect your fresh request to the captive portal page.  Some portals also provide a walled garden, so you can see cafe ads or menu items  but not access  the whole  web until you have  agreed  to policy.  A local cafe  has  a policy  to issue  half hour session leases,as a \"fair\"method to knock down clients and give others a chance to log in.  One  Cafe  also revokes  leases more  frequently  during  lunch  periods in hopes turning  over tables  during  lunch time,  and  they inform you of that intent the first  time you login.  Also  some  cafe website portals  are NOT optimized  for mobile devices.  The  agree dialog  can be hard to find if you need  to scroll white space to find a miniscule boxed button or  pull-down control.\n", "Q: Will pygobject for Python 3 be included in 11.10?

I am interested in using the new features provided with GTK3 with Python 3 but I have been unable due to the complexity involved with getting pygobject setup with Python 3. And since Python 3.2 is included by default (that's what I've heard anyways), now would be the perfect time to include pygobject for it as well.\n\nA: Yes, the launchpad page for pygobject shows that 3.0.0 is in Oneiric, and that there is a python3-gobject package available for it.\n", "Q: Autoproxy's auto mode doesn't work I don't if this is the right place to ask this question, so please let me know if I can get better answer elsewhere.\nI just moved to Ubuntu 11.04 from Windows Vista.\nI've been using Firefox Autoproxy + SSH for quite a while in Vista and it's working perfectly.\nBut in Ubuntu the auto mode of Autoproxy actually become the global mode, which use the SSH proxy for every site I go to and this is significantly slowing down my surfing speed. And the global mode is still works asglobal mode.\nI've no idea why this is happening. So can anyone give me a hint ?\nThanks in advance.\n\nA: Ubuntu really has no control over what Firefox does or does not do with their plug-ins.\nInformation regarding this plug-in:\nAbout this Add-on\nAutoProxy is an add-on to help you use your proxy (http/socks) automatically & efficiently.\nWith AutoProxy, you no longer need to switch your proxy status between on & off manually.

In other words is Lubuntu a good choice or not? I mean, does Lubuntu have any disadvantages to it when it comes to new hardware support, or whatever?\n\nNote: This may look like an off-topic question leading only to a discussion, but bear with me for a second here. I don't mean to discuss which of the two is better or whatever, I'd rather hear facts.\n\nA: Lubuntu, which is a part of Ubuntu, uses exactly the same drivers and all the software from Ubuntu is readily available. There's also no problem of just installing it from within a normal Ubuntu install and then you can choose when you login. I've also been told, but not confirmed, that you can run indicators for Unity on LXpanel. You can install just LXDE by installing http://apt.ubuntu.com/p/lxde, which is recommendable if you want to replace the shell, but still use Firefox, Thunderbird, LibreOffice, etc. Lubuntu replaces all of those, but then there's nothing wrong with installing them as well. http://apt.ubuntu.com/p/lubuntu-desktop for the entire package. \nIn other words, there is nothing wrong with using Lubuntu. The benefit from using Unity is that you get far easier and faster access to data and apps, along with some nice window handling capabilities. But if you can live without those and want a really snappy DE, then LXDE is quite nice. \n\nA: Lubuntu is the lighter flavour available which has a very fast desktop but is missing some of the elements of it's bigger brother...  If you can live without the eye candy, multimedia keys (volume up/down/mute) and use a lighter office suite (Abiword, Gnumeric) then it's perfect for you...

The way I understand it, \"Suggested packages\" are just that - suggestions. Maybe they'll help users of package foo, maybe not. I want to decide for my self, and you can decide for yourself.

Sometimes, I didn't remember what keys had I pressed, occasionally switched a text box to right-to-left layout. Well, maybe this is a very useful feature for Arabic users, but I just don't know how to switch back to left-to-right layout.\n(P.S. In MS Windows, there's a text direction option in the right button menu for the text box. However, in Linux (GNOME Classic) I didn't see any.)\n\nA: In GNOME (v2 and v3) the direction of a widget is set by the first character in the text box. That means that if the text you insert into the text box starts with a unicode character that has RTL directionality, the layout for the rest of the content will be RTL.\nIf you want to override this behavior you can insert an invisible character called RLM/LRM as the first character in your content. In GNOME this is done by right click->\"Insert unicode control character\"-> select RLM or LRM. keep in mind that once it's used, RLM/LRM becomes part of your string and always be displayed that way.\nThere is an unofficial GNOME input method that makes it easier to manage these characters, but that will probably be used by RTL users who need it more often.\n", "Q: Are there any Ubuntu-based equivalents of Corel Draw, PageMaker, PhotoShop and Quark Express Are there any Ubuntu based application for the below listed softwares.\n\n\n*\n\n*Corel Draw - latest version\n\n*PageMaker - Latest version\n\n*Photoshop - Latest version\n\n*Quark Express - latest version\n\nA: These are the best alternatives to the softwares you have listed above:\n1) CorelDraw - Inkscape, Xara Xtreme and Scribus (for desktop publishing only)\n2) Pagemaker - Scribus, Lucidpress and Spring Publisher\n3) Photoshop - GIMP, Krita, CinePaint and Pinta\n4) Quark Express - Same alternatives as Pagemaker and probably CorelDraw too.\nSource: I manage a website which publishes free and open source alternatives to commercial softwares so I have to research about lot of softwares. You can check it here.\n\nA: Photoshop is a raster graphic editor. Ubuntu has Gimp and Krita\n\nPageMaker and QuarkXPress are both desktop publishing applications. It's interesting you mentioned those because Adobe InDesign is currently a clear leader among commercial applications in this area.

Our project programmatically calls Javadoc from within our running executable. To do so, we obviously need to know the location of the tools.jar file which is part of the JDK distribution, but not the JRE distribution. The packages were installed into /usr/lib/jvm/java-6-sun-1.6.0.26/ and there are bin and other directories under the two areas (JDK/JRE) which provide the various standard binaries.\nWhenever we execute a java program (via the java binary), the internal java.home variable seems to overwrite any JAVA_HOME environment variable provided. We have concluded that the binary thus derives its java.home from the path of the binary. The java binary under the jdk really is a link to the jre version. Thus, no matter which one you 'execute', you are always getting the jre version, and thus the java.home directory is defined to be /usr/lib/jvm/java-6-sun-1.6.0.26/jre.\nAs such, any running executable can not seem to find the tools.jar file, and even passing the -cp /usr/lib/jvm/java-6-sun-1.6.0.26/jdk/lib/tools.jar option does not help.  We're hoping that someone can help shed some light on how we can correctly access the tools.jar file enabling us to correctly be able to call the com.sun.tools.javadoc.Main.execute method.\nExample execution:\njava -cp /usr/lib/jvm/java-6-sun/lib/tools.jar -jar comtor.jar -sourcepath .\n\nException in thread \"main\" java.lang.NoClassDefFoundError: com/sun/tools/javadoc/Main\n    at comtor.Comtor.main(Unknown Source)\nCaused by: java.lang.ClassNotFoundException: com.sun.tools.javadoc.Main\n    at java.net.URLClassLoader$1.run(URLClassLoader.java:202)\n    at java.security.AccessController.doPrivileged(Native Method)\n    at java.net.URLClassLoader.findClass(URLClassLoader.java:190)\n    at java.lang.ClassLoader.loadClass(ClassLoader.java:306)\n    at sun.misc.Launcher$AppClassLoader.loadClass(Launcher.java:301)\n    at java.lang.ClassLoader.loadClass(ClassLoader.java:247)\n    ... 1 more\n\n\nA: Well, it's a hack, but we ended up copying the tools.jar file into the jre/lib/ext directory as if we were installing a 3rd party jar file as an extension.  This seems like an unnatural action and that we should be doing something on the command line via the -cp option (tried it and it failed), or through an environment variable (tried that too and it failed too).\n", "Q: Dell Vostro hangs/freezes randomly after AC power or wifi swtiched off I am running Natty Narwhal on a Dell Vostro (I don't know the model number).

How can I dual-boot ubuntu and windows? When I view my disk space in Windows, it just looks like I have one big drive for all the usual stuff, plus a second little guy for recovery files. However, the Ubuntu installation and GParted reveal this:\nwhy are there so many partitions? do you really need all of those, windows?\n\"System\" and \"Recovery\" don't sound like things I want to delete, and I Googled HP Tools and it sounds like it has something to do with BIOS. I considered creating a set of recovery disks and deleting the recovery partition, but I can't find the option to do this -- whenever I go to the menu where the internet tells me I should find the option to create recovery disks, it isn't there!\nEven if I did do this, I'd only have one free partition, and I'd have to reformat the entire thing as an extended partition just to run Ubuntu -- would that even work? Or would Windows and Ubuntu be upset having to share an extended partition?\nI'm feeling a bit down, I was rather looking forward to installing Ubuntu... :c\n\nA: So you have 4 partitions and all of them are primary so you can't create an extended partition, right?\nI think, apart from a second HDD, the only option would be to find a partition you can sacrifice in order to free up an entry for the extended partition (or install a second hard drive, it it's possible) \nOne option would be to completely remove the recovery partition and then shrink the /dev/sda2 partition - Windows should continue to work but you won't be able to re-install it if it suddenly stops.\nAnother option is to remove the /dev/sda2 partition (provided you don't have anything valuable there), create an extended partition in its place, create an ntfs partition inside of the extended partition and check if the recovery thingie is able to install to that. If it fails you should be able to delete the extended partition and re-create the primary one.\nRegarding your question of Windows an Ubuntu \"sharing\" an extended partition - this is totally possible, actually nothing is really \"shared\" in this case.\nOne thing to consider before doing anything is creating a per-sector disk image dump - this may take a while but you may be able to restore partitions in case things go bad.\nThe best option, IMO, is wiping all this windows stuff and going Ubuntu-only :)\n\nA: Well, first u have to figure out which primary partition windows resides on, so boot into the ubuntu livecd if you can, or boot into any other linux distro that supports windows drive mounting (FAT32/NTFS) and mount the four detected partitions (i believe ubuntu automatically does that for u, there should be drive icons on ur desktop that says \"xGB filesystem\", double click on the icons and u'll mount the partitions and open them with nautilus), then use nautilus or whatever your favourite file browser to locate the partition where u see all the windows system files (i.e. WINDOWS, system32), mark down that particular partition (/dev/sdax or /dev/hdax), then backup all your data (or just stuff u wanna keep) on the other partitions and then u can safely re-partition ALL the other drives EXCEPT for the marked down windows drive, you can delete all the other primary drives and create new extended partitions (i suggest u do that in windows, linux formatted extended drives sometimes don't get recognized in windows) and a second primary partition for ubuntu and perhaps additional swap space. Once the partitions are setup, u can proceed to installing ubuntu on the second primary drive. Remember to install the grub bootloader to MBR (i wouldn't suggest u to do this if ur installing other distros, but since ubuntu's bootloader is pretty good AND ur just dual booting Windows and Ubuntu, u can safely do this without causing problems booting other OSes or corrupting partitions), it should configure grub for ur system so theres NO tweaking needed. And yeah, that should be it. Hope this helps u.\nBTW i used to own hp PCs that have four primary partitions as well, but i never had the problem where windows would display one big drive instead of four separate partitions...\nP.S. No u cannot install ubuntu onto an extended partition, in fact, u cannot install ANY OSes on an extended partition, even windows, all OSes must reside in primary partitions in order for the BIOS to boot them.\nP.P.S No, don't mess with the HP Tools, you don't need to mess with the BIOS to edit partitions, u'll risk bricking ur computer if u stuff up editing the BIOS.\n\nA: So I assume that u see one big drive when logged into Windows 7. One solution is to shrink that big partition and make some space for Ubuntu.\nHere's how u shrink your drive.\n\n\n*\n\n*Go to Control Panel, change the View By to Large Icons\n\n*Click on Administrative Tools and double click on Computer Management.\n\n*Select Disk Management which is under Storage.\n\n*Right click on the partition and select SHRINK VOLUME\n\n*Make about 30GB of space for Ubuntu.\n\n\n\nOnce U have 30GB u can go ahead with Ubuntu installation in this way.\nDuring Installation Select Specify Partitions Manually. To begin creating partitions, select the free space(30GB Part) and click on the Add… button.\n\n\n\n*\n\n*Click on the “Add” button. In the new window, type 2048 in the “New partition size in megabytes” field and select the “swap area” option from the “Use as:” list. Click the OK button.\n\n*Now, click on the “Add” button. In the new window, select the “Primary” option, input a value between 8,000 and 20,000 in the “New partition size in megabytes” field and select / as the “Mount point.” Click the OK button.\n\n*Click on the “Add” button again and from the new window and select the “Primary” option, type in whatever space you have left in your hard disk in the “New partition size in megabytes” field. And select /home as the “Mount point.” Click the OK button. You are done with the hard part.\n\n\nClick “Install Now” to proceed with the installation process.\n(The System, Recovery etc.. are not visible inside Windows. Is it?)\nP.S.\nThere's also another wonderful Propitiatory Software for windows with which u can literally control Ur NTFS/FAT Partitions. Its called EASEUS Partition Master v5.5 Pro, U can use this to partition any Drive without loosing ur data. \n\nA: I have the same problem. It will not let me shrink the c: drive no more than 6gb. So I am defragmenting. I have windows 7 and it has the recovery option as well. So defragmenting and shrinking seems to work. It is just taking longer. I have been trying to partition this for 24 hours. I tried wubi and it was slow. My specs are 2gb of ram, dual core processor, AMD, Compaq CQ57 which btw is a useless laptop. It is cheap but useless for stuff like this. From my experience this will work. As long as you have patience.

They provide a pbk file, and in Windows you just have to double click it to make the connection. Can I use this in a certain way in Ubuntu?\nI know that the pbk file is a text file I can open to extract maybe useful information, but I don't know what.

Here you choose \"Point-to-Point Tunneling Protocol (PPTP)\" (not Cisco compatible VPN)\n\n*Give the necessary data:\n\n\n*\n\n*Gateway: this is the VPN address (PhoneNumber in the .pbk file) \n\n*User name and password\n\n\n*I had to follow this third step to get it work: Uncheck the checkbox \"Available to all users\" AND restart after unchecking the checkbox!

There is a libunity library but this is heavily glib oriented so is relatively unsuited to Qt. As mentioned in the other answer, the most convenient way to integrate with the launcher is to use the low level dbus API.\nThe basic concept of how to integrate with the launcher is you send a signal to the launcher with an application ID and a set of properties. The application ID is the file name of the .desktop file, normally stored in /usr/share/applications:\n//create the signal\nQDBusMessage signal = QDBusMessage::createSignal(\"/\", \n    \"com.canonical.Unity.LauncherEntry\", \"Update\");\n\n//set the application ID\nsignal << \"application://firefox.desktop\";\n\n//set the properties\nQVariantMap properties;\n    ...\nsignal << properties;\n\n//send the signal\nQDBusConnection::sessionBus().send(signal);\n\nCounter\nTo set the counter, you will need to set the properties such that the count is visible and give it the desired integer value:\nqint64 counter_value = 1;\nproperties[\"count-visible\"] = true; //set the count to visible\nproperties[\"count\"] = counter_value; //set the counter value\n\nProgress Bar\nTo set the progress bar, you will need to set the properties such that the progress is visible and give it the desired double value:\ndouble progress_value = 0.5;\nproperties[\"progress-visible\"] = true; //set the progress bar to visible\nproperties[\"progress\"] = progress_value; //set the progress value\n\nQuicklist\nThe quicklist can be set by using the dbusmenu Qt library. You will need to include the header file:\n#include <dbusmenuexporter.h>\n\nThe quicklist is created as a QMenu menu in Qt. This menu is 'exported' over dbusmenu using a DBusMenuExporter object. When exporting, you give this object a unique path and then reference that path to tell the launcher item which menu to display as a quicklist.\nIn your main window class declaration, add the following instance variables:\nQMenu *quicklist;\nDBusMenuExporter *quicklist_exporter;\n\nThen, in the constructor function:\nquicklist = new QMenu(this);\n//exports the menu over dbus using the object: /com/me/myapp/quicklist\nquicklist_exporter = new DBusMenuExporter(\"/com/me/myapp/quicklist\", quicklist);\n\nTo add items to the menu, use the [addAction](http: //qt-project.org/doc/qt-5.0/qtwidgets/qmenu.html#addAction) method of the menu to add [QAction](http: //qt-project.org/doc/qt-5.0/qtwidgets/qaction.html) objects.\nTo set the quicklist of the launcher icon, set the 'quicklist' property of the signal:\nproperties[\"quicklist\"] = \"/com/me/myapp/quicklist\";\n\nConfiguring the Project File\nYou will need to configure the .pro file to add dbus support: QT += dbus. In order to build with quicklist support, you will need to have the dbusmenu-qt development libraries (libdbusmenu*dev) installed. You can then add the following to the project file to include the dbusmenu library:\n#import the dbusmenu-qt library for quicklists\ngreaterThan(QT_MAJOR_VERSION, 4) {\n    INCLUDEPATH += /usr/include/dbusmenu-qt5/\n    LIBS += -ldbusmenu-qt5\n} else {\n    INCLUDEPATH += /usr/include/dbusmenu-qt/\n    LIBS += -ldbusmenu-qt\n}\n\nExample Application\nTo see an full example using all of the launcher functionality from Qt, look at this Github project.\n", "Q: gThumb for file browsing Ubuntu 11.10 enforces gThumb for even normal non-image file browsing. gthumb might be a good image browser but its a pathetic file browser (compared to nautilus) can we get nautilus back in 11.10 ?\n\nA: I have just found a solution here:\nhttps://help.ubuntu.com/community/DefaultFileManager#Restoring_Nautilus_as_a_default\nGo to the end of the article and you will find the easiest way to do it as follows:\n\n\nOne more way - for \"mousemonkeys\", like me\n\nJust do in terminal\n\nexo-preferred-applications\n\nthen switch to Utilities tab and select File Manager you prefer. And that's all! \n\n\nYou could need to install exo-utils before, but it will prompt you if necessary.\nAnyway the command to install it is:\n\nsudo apt-get install exo-utils\n\n", "Q: Eclipse's executable file won't run in ubuntu I just downloaded the eclipse package from the eclipse website in zipped format. I unzipped it in my user directory and set 777 permissions, but double clicking the eclipse executable won't do anything. I tried running the executable file through terminal, but it shows the error:\nbash: ./eclipse: No such file or directory\nThen I installed eclipse through Ubuntu software center, which runs successfully. Just the downloaded version doesn't run.\nI have installed OpenJDK in Ubuntu 10.10. Can anyone please tell what is wrong with my Eclipse?\n\nA: The message from bash suggests that there is no such file - I suggest you to double-check that you're in the correct directory, that execute bit is indeed set etc.\nTry invoking it like this:\ncd ~/folder/where/you/unpacked-it\nchmod +x ./eclipse\n./eclipse\n\nActually, even changing permissions is not necessary - the binary already had executable bit set.\n\nA: I had the same problem about the Eclipse binary and started to follow the suggestions of this thread. I checked the OS and kernel versions, and tried to change the file permissions.\nAfter executing the chmod command I checked with ls -l and the output surprised me: nothing was changed.\nAfter some more tries and a minute to think, I figure out the problem: The eclipse folder was in a directory outside the OS drive. It was on a NTFS drive, and I hadn't any special permission on it.\nThe easy solution was to take it back to the home/opt folder. But I'm still interested in a solution that enables the execution inside a NTFS partition.\n\nA: My OS was actually 64 bit version. And the Eclipse package I downloaded was 32 bit. It seems stupid, but usually 32 bit softwares run without any problem in 64 bit operating systems. So I didn't pay much attention there.\nI downloaded the 64 bit version of Eclipse and it works fine.\nThanks @Sergey for the time and patience.\n", "Q: How to embed on-screen keyboard into gnome-screensaver 3.x unlock screen? The gconf value /apps/gnome-screensaver/embedded_keyboard_enable in Oneiric no longer works obviously. Is there a way to show virtual keyboard in gnome-screensaver 3.x? Does similar dconf value exist?\nIt makes unlocking the screen without the keyboard on tablets impossible.\n\nA: Gnome.org gives details of how to enable the embedded keyboard for a locked screen including the gsettings values\nAny tablet-type screen keyboard must compy with the XEmbed specification.\nFortunately the standard onboard keyboard is XEmbed compliant - you need to pass the --xid parameter (type onboard --help for parameters you can pass to onboard)\nThus\ngsettings set org.gnome.desktop.screensaver embedded-keyboard-enabled true\ngsettings set org.gnome.desktop.screensaver embedded-keyboard-command \"onboard --xid\"\n\n\n\nA: The gnome-screensaver was updated to use the new GSettings APIs instead of GConf. You can look through the list of options stored in GSettings by running gsettings list-recursively | less from a terminal, or by using the dconf-editor application.\nThe settings for gnome-screensaver have moved to the org.gnome.desktop.screensaver schema:\nevan@caron:~$ gsettings list-recursively | grep org.gnome.desktop.screensaver\norg.gnome.desktop.screensaver embedded-keyboard-command ''\norg.gnome.desktop.screensaver embedded-keyboard-enabled false\norg.gnome.desktop.screensaver idle-activation-enabled true\norg.gnome.desktop.screensaver lock-delay uint32 0\norg.gnome.desktop.screensaver lock-enabled true\norg.gnome.desktop.screensaver logout-command ''\norg.gnome.desktop.screensaver logout-delay uint32 7200\norg.gnome.desktop.screensaver logout-enabled false\norg.gnome.desktop.screensaver status-message-enabled true\norg.gnome.desktop.screensaver user-switch-enabled true\n\nSo you can run gsettings set org.gnome.desktop.screensaver embedded-keyboard-enabled true to enable the onscreen keyboard.
